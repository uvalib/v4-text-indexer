      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I MEMORIALS OF TRAVELS IN GREECE THE ELD. Oh! blessèd, blessèd be the Eld, Its echoes and its shades,— The tones that from all time outswelled, The light that never fades;— The silver-pinion'd memories, The symbol and the tale,— The soul-enchasèd melodies Of merriment or bale. Oh, glory! that we wrestle So valiantly with Time, And do not alway nestle In listlessness or crime: We do not live and die Irrevocably blind, But raise our hands and sigh For' the might we left behind. Each goodly sign and mystic letter, That angel-haunted books unfold,— We cherish more,—we know them better, When we remember they are old; And friends, though fresh, and hale, and cheerly, And young, as annals hold, Yet, if we prize them very dearly, We love to call them old. Yon scented shrub,—I passed it by, The youngling of the breeze; I sat me, sad and soberly, Beneath those ancient trees, Whose branches, dight in summer pall, Their gloom in moaning wore; For' they told me of the Eld and all The mystery of yore. And in the gusts, I thought they pitied The falling of the young,— The fair, the subtle-witted, Fine limb, and honeyed tongue;— As man, from birth to funeral, Were but a tragic mime,— And, they the kinsman lineal Of the good and olden prime. I saw the hoary bulk of ocean A' couching on the shore, With a ripple for its motion, And a murmur for its roar; I gazed, but not as on the dead, But as if Death were held In awe, by a thing that slumberèd In the deep and silent Eld. The golden school of Eld is rife With many a God-sent ray, And jewel-gleams of perfect life, Hereditary day! Alas! we cannot quite awake,— But when we feel we dream, That hour, our heart is strong to shake The falsities that seem. For our bark is on the angle Of a wide and bending stream, Whose bosky banks entangle The eye's divergent beam;— The ridgy steeps hide in the way, Whither the stream is quest, As on a lake, the mirror'd day Repeats its waveless rest. How know we, when so clearly still, Where its nether fountains be? That it welleth in a viewless hill, And passeth to the sea? The tide beneath us,—where it welled Dull sense regardeth not,— But it was once the tide of Eld, And we have not all forgot. Great Art hath bound a diadem, Upon his front serene, Whose every pure and charmèd gem Bedews him with its sheen; And thus,—nor deem it wildly new, Nor slur of idle tongue,— But true, as God's own words are true, The Eld is alway young;— Young as the flush of all-blue light, Or eve's imperial eyes, And he who worshippeth aright, Shall aye be young and wise, And gentle as the virgin dove That primal chaos quelled, With Nature for his ladie-love, The daughter of the Eld. Sept. 20th, 1832. CORFU. 1832 It will be seen by its date that this was written before the abandonment of the British Protectorate. “It is an isle under Ionian skies, Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise.” Shelley Thou pleasant Island, whose rich garden-shores Have had a long-lived fame of loveliness, ??????? ?????????. —Odyss. vii. 79. Recorded in the historic song, that framed The unknown Poet of an unknown time, Illustrating his native Ithaca, And all her bright society of isles,— Most pleasant land! To us, who journeying come From the far west, and fall upon thy charms, Our earliest welcome to Ionian seas, Thou art a wonder and a deep delight, Thy usual habitants can never know. Thou art a portal, whence the Orient, The long-desired, long-dreamt-of, Orient, Opens upon us, with its stranger forms, Outlines immense and gleaming distances, And all the circumstance of faery-land. Not only with a present happiness, But taking from anticipated joys An added sense of actual bliss, we stand Upon thy cliffs, or tread the slopes that leave No interval of shingle, rock, or sand, Between their verdure and the Ocean's brow,— Whose olive-groves (unlike the darkling growth, That earns on western shores the traveller's scorn) Can wear the grey that on their foliage lies, As but the natural hoar of lengthened days,— Making, with their thick-bossed and fissured trunks, Bases far-spread and branches serpentine, Sylvan cathedrals, such as in old times Gave the first life to Gothic art, and led Imagination so sublime a way. Then forth advancing, to our novice eyes How beautiful appears the concourse clad In that which, of all garbs, may best befit The grace and dignity of manly form: The bright-red open vest, falling upon The white thick-folded kirtle, and low cap Above the high-shorn brow. Nor less than these, With earnest joy, and not injurious pride, We recognise of Britain and her force The wonted ensigns and far-known array; And feel how now the everlasting Sea, Leaving his old and once imperious Spouse, To faint, in all the beauty of her tears, On the dank footsteps of a mouldering throne, Has taken to himself another mate, Whom his uxorious passion has endowed, Not only with her antique properties, But with all other gifts and privilege, Within the circle of his regal hand. Now forward,—forward on a beaming path, But be each step as fair as hope has feigned it, For me, the memory of the little while, That here I rested happily, within The close-drawn pale of English sympathies, Will bear the fruit of many an after-thought, Bright in the dubious track of after-years. A DREAM OF SAPPHO. In the legend of the Leucadian promontory, which is fresh among the people, Phaon is the King of the Island, and the Poetess a foreign Queen. He slights her passion; she wanders over the hills in agony of heart, and heedless of her steps, she falls over the precipice. The mariners were all asleep, Save one half-dreaming at the stern, Who gently bade me upward turn My eyes, long gazing on the deep. The wind had stol'n away,—our skiff Rested, as if its sails were furled, Upon the tide which softly curled Around a triple-breasted cliff, Whose steeps, in mistiest day-time bright, Were almost above nature white, Bare-fronted to the westering moon, For the autumn night had past its noon. I prayed that not a soul might wake,— To be left utterly alone,— That not the faintest human tone, The silence of that time might break; When,—as of old the alien maids, Who sanctified Dodona's shades, Drew out the tale of human fate, From sounds of things inanimate, Wont with inclinèd ear to listen, Where branches rock or fountains rise, Till high intelligences glisten In their intense Egyptian eyes,— So I began, in that light breeze, Glancing along those noted seas, To trace a harmony distinct, A meaning in each change of tone, And sound to sound more strangely linkt, Than in my awe I dared to own:— But when in clearer unison That marvellous concord still went on, And, gently as a blossom grows, A frame of syllables uprose, With a delight akin to fear My heart beat fast and strong, to hear Two murmurs beautifully blent, As of a voice and instrument,— A hand laid lightly on low chords,— A voice that sobbed between its words. “Stranger! the voice that trembles in your ear, You would have placed, had you been fancy-free, First in the chorus of the happiest sphere, The home of deified mortality: “Stranger, the voice that trembles here below, While in your life, enjoyed a fame so loud, That utmost nations listened to its flow, And of its presence the old Earth was proud: “Stranger, the voice is Sappho's,—weep, oh! weep, That the soft tears of sympathy may fall Into this prison of the sunless deep, Where I am laid in miserable thrall. “Not of my mortal pride, my mortal woe Would I now speak;—there is no gentle maid, Nor youth kind-hearted, but has sighed to know, What was my love and how it was repaid! “I had dear friends, who wept with bitter tears, To watch my spirit's stream, which else had run, In fulness and delight, its course of years, Wasted and parched by that relentless sun. “Of this far rock, and its miraculous power, They heard, emmarvelled, and with sedulous prayer Conjured me not to lose one precious hour, But seek the cure of all my misery there. “‘The Gods,’ they argued in their fond esteem, ‘Love their harmonious daughter far too well, Not to pour forth on her diseasèd dream The benediction of that soothing spell. “‘When many a one, whose name will never shine On after ages, there has found release, How shall not she, already half divine, Claim the same gift of spiritual peace?’ “I told them, ‘Thousands in that chilly deep Might find relief from their weak hearts’ annoy :— Venus herself might try the counselled leap, And rise oblivious of her hunter-boy; “‘The mystery of the place might moderate Th' authentic passion of imperial Jove, But did they hope for me that common fate, They could know nothing of a Poet's love.’ “But vain my words;—the tender-cruel hand Of blinded friendship guided me away,— I would have died in my own Lesbian land, Not in these regions of the waning day! “Thus here all bootless adorations paid, I dared the height of this tremendous shore; What were your agonies, ye hope-betrayed! When to your bosom I came back no more? “Of the mysterious pass, that leads through death, From life to life, I must not speak to thee; Enough that now I breathed another breath, Beyond the portals of mortality. “A stream received me, whose æthereal flow Came to my senses like a perfumed sigh, From the rich flowers that shed their light below, And bowed their jewelled heads as I passed by. “And opposite a tide of sound was driven, That made the air all music, and from far Glimmered bright faces through a dead-gold heaven, As in an earthly night star follows star. “At last I came to a gigantic gate, That opened to a steep-ascending lawn, Whence rose a Temple, whose white marble state Was fused into that gold and purple dawn. “Sisterly voices were around me chanting, ‘Hail! Thou whom Song has numbered with the blest, From fear, and hope, and passion's feverish panting, Pass to thy crown, a Muse's glorious rest.’ “Entranced I entered,—but there stood between Me and the fane, a queenly form and stern, Upon whose brow, in letters all of sheen, I saw the ancient name of Themis burn. “She laid her hand on mine, it felt so cold, She asked me, ‘Whether I, whose soul had earned This highest Heaven, now felt serene and bold;’ Then I into my conscious self returned. “She asked me, ‘Whether all that heart-distress, In which my yielding womanhood had erred From this my Goddess-state with bitterness And shame was seen;’ I answered not a word. “Then, piercingly, she asked me ‘Whether He, Before whose charms I prostrated so low My woman's worth, my Poet's dignity, Was clear forgot;’—I answered slowly, ‘No.’ “Strange strength was in me; with consummate scorn, I spoke of ‘That Appollo, who could deem, That by his magic leap, the true love-lorn Could wake to bliss, as from a troublous dream.’ “I said, ‘The promised peace, the calm divine, The cold self-power, and royalty of will, Or there, or elsewhere, never could be mine, For I was Sappho,—Phaon's Sappho still.’ “There was dead blackness on the golden sky, There was dumb silence in the resonant air, But still I cried aloud in agony, ‘Heaven was not Heaven, if Phaon was not there.’ “With arms upraised, and towering looks averse, That fearful Being uttered,—‘Be it so, Blessing thou wilt not, thou shalt have a curse; High bliss thou wilt not, thou shalt have deep woe. “‘Thou hast defiled the Gods' most choicest dower, Poesy, which in chaste repose abides, As in its atmosphere;—that placid flower Thou hast exposed to passion's fiery tides; “‘Within the cold abyss, degraded, lone, Beneath the rock whose power thou hast blasphemed, From thy Parnassian, long-expectant, throne, Lie banished, till by some new fate redeemed.’ “When will that new fate be? I linger on,— I know not what I wish; Oh! tell me, thou That weep'st for one thou would'st have smiled upon, Dear Stranger, tell me where is Phaon now?” Here paused the Voice, and now, methought, I spoke, But what I know not; for there passed a shock Throughout my senses, like a lightning-stroke; I started to my feet;—the tall white Rock Walled the far waste of silent sea, the morn Light-lined the East, on grey-white wings upborne. THE RETURN OF ULYSSES. The identity of Ithaca and Thiáke is satisfactorily demonstrated by Sir W. Gell, and other writers. There still remains, too, in the minds of the islanders, the legendary remembrance of the wandering king and the faithful wife, who weaves and spoils her web for very sorrow and distraction. The localities are quite as recognisable as could be expected:—a Grotto was discovered a few years ago by the shepherds, just above the shore of the deep bay (??????? ???????????), which bears a faithful likeness to the Homeric portrait of the cave of the nymphs. It is beautifully hung with stalactites, which are evidently the “distaffs” of its divine inhabitants, and its floor is strewn with fragments of votive amphoræ and other relics of ancient worship. In another part of the island is a Fountain, still called “Melannéron.” Now the cattle of Eumæus come to the fount of Arethusa to drink the “black water;” and as this is still the common drinking-place of all the neighbouring cattle, the name has probably come down from the Homeric times. The Man of wisdom and endurance rare, A sundry-coloured and strange-featured way, Our hearts have followed; now the pleasant care Is near its end,—the oars' sweet-echoed play, Falls on the cliffs of Ithaca's deep bay;— The enemy, on whose impetuous breast The hero rode undaunted, night and day, (Such was Minerva's power, and Jove's behest) Scorns the inglorious strife and lays his wrath to rest. And how returns the tempest-tossed? his prows Gay-garlanded, with grand triumphal song? Leaps he upon the strand, and proudly vows Dire vengeance unto all who did him wrong? Not so; for him, all force and passion strong, And fretful tumult, for a while are o'er,— He is borne gently, placidly, along, And laid upon his own belovèd shore. Even as a wearied child, in quiet sleep once more! There is no part of that archaic Lay, That strikes with such resistless power on me, As this pure artist-touch, this tender ray, A perfect-simple light of poesy; Not the nice wiles of chaste Penelope,— Not the poor pining dog that died of joy,— Not the grey smoke the wanderer yearned to see, Whose wavings he had traced, a careless boy, Sweet as they are, for me this preference can destroy. Where the “stone distaffs” of the nymphs of old, Still make rich tracery in the sacred Cave,— Where peasants the dark-shadowed Fountain cold, Hail by the name the Poet found or gave, Where on the Eagle-height the walls out-brave All time, and only the full-fruited vine Trails o'er the home,—it may be o'er the grave, Of Him for whom these memories combine,— Rest, care-worn mortal! rest, and let his sleep be thine. TEMPE. The repute of Tempe as a proverb of surpassing beauty, is exclusively Roman, and possibly few who spoke or wrote of it ever saw it. Livy's description (xliv) is one of terror, and what we now call ‘sublimity.’ We are in Tempe, Peneus glides below,— That is Olympus,—we are wondering Where, in old history, Xerxes the great King, Wondered. Herodotus, vii., 128. How strangely pleasant this to know! We may have gazed on scenes of grander flow, And on rocks cast in shapes more marvellous, Now this delicious calm entices us, These platain shades, to let the dull world go. A poet's Mistress is a hallowed thing, And all the beauties of his verse become Her own;—so be it with the poet's Vale: Listen those emerald waters murmuring, Behold the cliffs, that wall the gods' old home, And float into the Past with softly swelling sail. OLYMPUS. With no sharp-sided peak or sudden cone, Thou risest o'er the blank Thessalian plain, But in the semblance of a rounded throne, Meet for a monarch and his noble train To hold high synod;—but I feel it vain, With my heart full and passionate as now, To frame my humble verse, as I would fain, To calm description,—I can only bow My head and soul, and ask again, “if that be Thou?” I feel before thee, as of old I felt, (With sense, as just, more vivid in degree) When first I entered, and unconscious knelt Within the Roman Martyr's sanctuary: I feel that ages laid their faith on Thee, And if to me thou art a holy hill, Let not the pious scorn,—that Piety Though veiled, that Truth, though shadowy, were still All the world had to raise its heart and fallen will. Thou Shrine which man, of his own natural thought, Gave to the God of Nature, and girt round With elemental mightiness, and brought Splendour of form and depth of thunderous sound, To wall about with awe the chosen ground,— All without toil of slaves or lavished gold, Thou wert upbuilt of memories profound, Imaginations wonderful and old, And the pure gems that lie in Poets' hearts untold. God was upon Thee in a thousand forms Of Terror and of Beauty, stern and fair, Upgathered in the majesty of storms, Or floating in the film of summer air; Thus wert Thou made ideal everywhere; From Thee the odorous plumes of Love were spread, Delight and plenty through all lands to bear,— From Thee the never-erring bolt was sped To curb the impious hand or blast the perjured head How many a Boy, in his full noon of faith, Leaning against the Parthenon, half-blind With inner light, and holding in his breath, Awed by the image of his own high mind, Has seen the Goddess there so proudly shrined, Leave for awhile her loved especial home, And pass, though wingless, on the northward wind, On to thy height, beneath the eternal dome, Where Heaven's grand councils wait, 'till Wisdom's self shall come. Ours is another world, and godless now Thy ample crown; 'tis well,—yes,—be it so, But I can weep this moment, when thy brow Light-covered with fresh hoar of autumn snow, Shines in white light and chillness, which bestow New grace of reverend loveliness, as seen With the long mass of gloomy hills below: Blest be our open faith! too grand, I ween, To grudge these votive tears to Beauty that has been. A VISION OF THE ARGONAUTS. At Volo, a Greek peasant asked us whether it was true that the first ship that ever sailed started from this bay. It is a privilege of great price to walk With that old sorcerer Fable, hand in hand, Adown the shadowy vale of History: There is no other wand potent as his, Out of that scene of gloomy pilgrimage, Where prostrate splendors and unsated graves Are ever rained upon by human tears, To make a Paradise of noblest art, A gallery of bright thoughts, serene ideas, Pictorial graces, everlasting tints, To the heart's eye delicious,—pure delight Of Beauty and calm Joy alternating With exercise of those high attributes, Which make the will of man indomitable,— Justice, and enterprise, and patriot-love. That Peasant's simple question to my thoughts Became a mystic thread,—a golden clue; For when I drew it towards me, all the veil Of the deep past shrunk up, and light profuse Fell round me from time-clouded memories; The full-noon-day, it seemed to me, went back, And passed into the pearly grey of morn, From which, in outline dim, slowly came forth Pelion,—his lower steeps (now populous With village voices) desolate and bare; And the now naked range of loftier rock, Thick-vested with a mantle of warm pine. Along the shore, the turreted serail, And bright-adorned kiosks, and low bazaar, Into a city strange, of ancient form, But to my spirit's sight faintly defined, Was changed;—yet I could palpably discern A crowd that stood before a portico, And a thin smoke that from the midst arose, As of a sacrifice; and close beside, The waters rested in inviolate calm. Upon their edge, yet clinging to the sand, There was a shape, of other frame and kind Than I had ever seen the wave embrace; A burden of full-armèd men it bore, And from its centre the aspiring stem Of a straight oak, Dodona's holy growth, Upsprung, with leafy coronal unshorn. The joy of prosperous omens on the land Awoke the silence of that solemn dawn; And as it ceased, a clear and manly voice Out of the shape responded musical, And thus its meaning sunk into my soul. “Not with the rapid foot and panting breast, With which, be Pelion's dark-haired front And mountain-thickets far away Our witnesses, the eager heart was wont To lead us to the boar's absconded rest Unwearied, while before us lay The hope of an illustrious prey,— Nor, by the impulse of Pheræan Vide Iliad, ii. 763, for the excel'ence of the horses of the hero, the eponymus of the house which gave its name to the place. Pheræ, now Vclestino, is near the Bœbèan marsh (ii. 711), a few miles to the N.W. of Volo. Pagasæ was its port. There are walls and the site of a temple on the hill above it. steeds, Bearing the warrior and the car Into the central depths of war, While he, thus, wingèd, hardly heeds The presence of opposing spears, More than the north wind fears The grove whose mass he can crush down like reeds; —Not thus the work is to be done, Which this fleet-passing hour will see begun. “For these are means, whose excellence can lead To victory in the practised chase Or common usage of heroic arms:— Our thought is now to do a hardier deed; Sublimer energy our spirit warms Than bard has ever sung in Grecian halls;— Where to succeed will place Our name 'mid nations' festivals, And where to fail itself will be A glory for eternity. “Over a wider and more dreary plain, Than curious mortals know, Trackless and markless as fresh-fallen snow,— An awful space, on which the stain Of human foot has never lain,— Uncrossed by cheerful bird,— Where never sound is heard, But the unpausing din, Half laughter and half groan, Of the Divinity that stirs within, And answers all the winds that blow In thunder-tone;— Over this mystic plain,— The earth-enclosing Ocean-plain, We are about to go. “And let no holy fear restrain The hearts, that know no fear beside; For, not in impious disdain Of the eternal rules, that bind The destinies of human kind Within sage limits, and wild pride, But with the free obedience Of a most perfect reverence, Dare we the untamèd billow to bestride. “For had it been in truth the imperial will Of Mother Nature, when her plastic hand Did the vast depths with buoyant liquid fill, To plant a barrier betwixt land and land, And keep each portion separate, Encircled by a special fate; How could the Gods, the everwise, Have urged us to our enterprise With favouring voices and protecting eyes? How could our rude sea-chariot be Made instinct with applauding Deity? “A just and noble aim, The Gods with love regard,— But the self-glorious, the bold Who honour not the laws of old, A jealous justice will reward, With woe and bitter shame; We have not forgot The miserable lot Of Tantalus, ambrosia-fed, Tantalus, whose kingly head Deep in deepest Hades lies, Eminent in agonies; Even where our journey leads, In that Eastern distance, bound To an ice-peak, ever bleeds He of the unclosed heart-wound, The unsubdued and godlike one, Who robbed the treasury of the sun; But he such warnings little heeds, Whose soul is fixed upon an honest end,— Him must the Gods befriend. “And is it not a virtuous aim, Even to the earth's extremest shore, By means no mortal force essayed before, To bear the glory of the Grecian name? To spoil the spoiler, wash away the stain Of foully-slaughtered parentage, restore To Greece the precious gift of yore, Kind Gods to Helle and her brother gave, Though Destiny restrained the power to save. “Thus hasting to a sacred war, With Pæan and delighted song, We feel our feet upon the Car, Which the broad-wingèd Winds shall bear along; No strength of ours their turbulence restrains, No will of ours their vagrant course commands, But ye who love us, fear not, for the reins Are in almighty and benignant hands.— And if the blindly-falling brand Of Fate, that neither spares the wise or brave, Far from his loved paternal land, Should lay some Hero under the dark wave; Yet let him not be deeply mourned, As dead inglorious, or cast out unurned: For the fond-pitying Nymphs below, Will cover him with golden sand, And sing above him songs of woe, Sweeter than we can understand; The grace of song shall breathe upon his name, And his Elysian bliss be endless as his fame.” There was a moment's pause, and then, methought, The exuberant shout, that to the warriors' strain Had made tumultuous prelude, came again, But with still loftier passion; to the cause I gave a quick attention, and beheld Above the low Magnesian promontory, A small and solitary flaccid cloud Lowly suspended, by the clear round sun The sun itself was supposed to have its bed in Colchis. Mimnermus apud Athen. (Which seemed to halt behind it as he rose) Gorgeously glorified; to this all eyes Were turned, and every voice a homage paid: “The Fleece, the Golden Fleece, our Golden Fleece,” Rose in a storm of sound, and instantly, Though with no visible wind or ruffled tide, But as impregnate with propelling power, The Shape, no more dependent on the sand, Into the open waters past, serene. Then as the Vision fainted, self-dispersed In the full-flaring light, a melody, Whose sense I could not justly apprehend, But that it was of blessing and delight, Emitted from th' oracular central tree, Caught up my heart, and bore it swift along With that strange shape, into mysterious depths Of placid darkness and undreaming sleep. THE SPARTANS AT THERMOPYLÆ. “Stranger! go tell the Spartans—we obeyed All that they told us, According to Herodotus. and below are laid,” Their laws and customs. According to Strabo. No parleying with themselves, no pausing thought Of worse or better consequence, was there, Their business was to do what Spartans ought, Sparta's chaste honour was their only care. First in the outlet of that narrowest pass, Between the tall straight cliffs and sullen tide, Before his Faithful, stood Leonidas,— Before the Few who could not leave his side. Never the hope of such a precious meed, Upon his most ambitious dreams had shone, Through Him the Gods for Sparta had decreed More fame than Athens earned at Marathon. And more than this, he knew in that proud hour, How high a price his single Life could claim, That in its sacrifice there lay the power, Alone to save his father-land from shame. Yet was he loth to meet that sacred fate, As he there stood, cramped in by rocks and sea, He would confront the Persian myriad's weight, And die an unbound Victim, fighting free. One more fair field,—one last unshackled blow Strong with concentrate vengeance, this was all That still remained to fill to overflow The measure of the glory of his fall. How He, and They who followed him in love, Went forth and perished, is a tale to tell, Such as old Bards to Epic music wove, And so felt he who wrote their Chronicle. The symbol Lion, that once stood in stone Over the Lion-hearted, is no more; Where sat the Last, on their sepulchral throne, Is now a thing of antiquarian lore. Nor mourn for this,—all other truth is vain. But this, to know at heart, that They are there, There in the giant cliffs, and perilous plain, Paths, fountains, forest, ocean, every where. Now let all Thought be Memory,—calmly wait, Till clear defined, before thy Spirit's eyes, Heroic Dignity, impersonate In awful phantoms, silently arise. Between the Men who noble deeds have done, And every Poet to the end of time, There is a brotherly communion, One Father-God has made them both sublime: And thus, to Thee, there can be nothing dead Of great things past, they live in thine own will, Thou givest them form,—they, on thy favoured head, Virtues of earth and Heavenly Love distil. GREEK RELIGION Could we, though but for an hour, burst through those gates adamantine, Which, as the children of man pass onward in swift generation, Time's dark cavern along, are heavily closing behind them! Could we but breathe the delight of the time when, fresh in his boyhood, Out of his own exuberant life, Man gave unto Nature, And new senses awoke, through every nerve of creation! Waves of the old Ægean!—I listen your musical ebbing; Smile to my eye, as you will, with smiles clear-crystal as ever, Bind, in your silvery net, fair capes and embowerèd islands, But ye can bear no more on your breast that vision of glory, When in the cool moon-dew went forth the imperial revel, Dolphins and pearl-shell cars, of the Queen and the People of Ocean; Whose sweet-undulant murmur the homeless mariner hearkened, Over the undulant sapphire, and trembled in glad adoration. How were ye voiced, ye Stars!—how cheerily Castor and Pollux Spoke to the quivering seaman, amid th' outpouring of tempest! With what a firm-set gaze on the belt triple-gemmed of Orion Looked the serene Greek child, as he thought of the suffering giant, Panting with sightless orbs for the dawn's miraculous healing! With what a sigh did he pass from the six proud deified sisters, On to the fate of the fallen, and mourned for the love that dethroned her! Not by elaborate charts did he read that book of the Heavens, But to his heart's fine ear it was taught by a heavenly master. Now from her window perchance may the maiden of desolate Hellas, When with the woes of her love and her land her spirit is heavy, Yearn to the white-bright moon, which over the curvèd horizon, Climbing the air still flushed with the flames of the opposite sunset, The contemporaneity of a transparent moonlight with the roseate æther and gold and orange tracts of sunset is one of the most impressive phenomena of these regions. Seems with affectionate eye to regard her, and weep to her weeping; But it is now not as when, having pined for Endymion's kindness, She with the mourners of love held personal sympathy ever, When in the sky's void chasms a wanderer, she to pilgrim, Over the world's sick plain, was a dear companion in sorrow. Down through the blue-grey thyme, which roofs their courses with odour, Rivulets, gentle as words from the lips of Beauty, are flowing; Still, in the dusky ravine, they deepen and freshen their waters, Still, in the thick-arched coves, they slumber and dimple delighted, Catching the full-swell'd fig, and the deep-stained arbutus ruby,— Still, to the sea's sand-brim, by royally gay oleanders, And oriental array of reeds, they are ever attended; But they are all dumb forms, unimpregnate with vital emotion, Now from the pure fount-head, no Nymph, her bosom expanding, Dazzles the way-worn wretch with the smile of her bland benediction, Giving the welcomed draught mysterious virtue and savour;— Now no curious hind in the noon-tide's magical ardour, On the mystical power of noon in the appearance of supernatural beings, vide Theocritus, i. 15; Lucan, iii. 422; Philostratus, Heroic. i. art 4; Porphyrius de Antro Nymph. c. xxvi. and xxvii. Peeps through the blossomy trellice, that over the pool's dark crystal Guards the immaculate forms of the awful Olympian bathers; Now at the wide stream-mouth never one, one amorous Triton Breathes to the surge and the tall marsh-blooms euphonious passion. These high Temples around, the religious shade of the olive Falls on the grass close-wove;—in the redolent valley beneath us, Stems of the loftiest platain their crowns large-leavèd are spreading, While the most motley of herds is adorning the calm of their umbrage;— Yet ye are gone, ye are vanished for ever, ye guardian Beings! Who in the time-gnarled trunks, broad branches, and summer enchantment Held an essentiäl life and a power, as over your members,— Soothing the rage of the storm by your piteous moans of entreaty, Staying the impious axe in the paralysed hand of the woodman. Daphne, tremulous nymph, has fled the benignant asylum Which, in the shape of the laurel, she found from the heat of Apollo;— Wan Narcissus has languished away from the languishing flower;— Hyacinth dwells no more in his brilliant abode, and the stranger Reads the memorial signs he has left, with a curious pleasure. Thou art become, oh Echo! a voice, an inanimate image; Where is the palest of maids, dark-tressed, darkwreathèd with ivy, Who with her lips half-opened, and gazes of beautiful wonder, Quickly repeated the words that burst on her lonely recesses, Low in a love-lorn tone, too deep-distracted to answer? What must have been thy Nature, oh Greece! when marvellous-lovely As it is now, it is only the tomb of an ancient existence? MARATHON. I could believe that under such a sky, Thus grave, thus streaked with thunderlight, of yore, The small Athenian troop rushed onward, more As Bacchanals, than men about to die. How weak that massive motley enemy Seemed to those hearts, full-fed on that high lore, Which, for their use, in his melodious store, Old Homer had laid up immortally! Thus Marathon was Troy,—thus here again, They were at issue with the barb'rous East, And favo'ring Gods spoke out, and walked the plain; And every man was an anointed priest Of Nemesis, empowerèd to chastise The rampant insolence that would not be made wise. THE CONCENTRATION OF ATHENS. The Poet Keats, to whom the old Greek mind seemed instinctively familiar, in an unpublished fragment, speaks of the Greek Poets as“Bards who died content on pleasant sward, Leaving great verse unto a little clan.” and continues with a prayer that he too may attain their old vigour, and sing “Unheard, Save of the quiet primrose and the span Of Heaven and tew ears.” Why should we wonder that from such small space Of Earth so much of human strength upgrew, When thus were woven bonds that tighter drew Round the Athenian heart than faith or race? Thus patriotism could each soul imbue With personal affections, face to face, And home was felt in every public place, And brotherhood was never rare or new. Thus Wisdom, from the neighbouring Parthenon, Down on the Areopagus could fix A watchful gaze: thus from the rising Pnyx The Orator's inspiring voice could reach Half o'er the City, and his solemn speech Was as a father's counsel to his son. PELASGIAN AND CYCLOPEAN WALLS. Ye cliffs of masonry, enormous piles, Which no rude censure of familiar Time Nor record of our puny race defiles, In dateless mystery ye stand sublime, Memorials of an age of which we see Only the types in things that once were Ye. Whether ye rest upon some bosky knoll, Your feet by ancient myrtles beautified, Or seem, like fabled dragons, to unroll Your swarthy grandeurs down a bleak hill-side, Still on your savage features is a spell That makes ye half divine, ineffable. With joy, upon your height I stand alone, As on a precipice, or lie within Your shadow wide, or leap from stone to stone, Pointing my steps with careful discipline, And think of those grand limbs whose nerve could bear These masses to their places in mid-air; Of Anakim, and Titans, and of days Saturnian, when the spirit of man was knit So close to Nature, that his best essays At Art were but in all to follow it, In all,—dimension, dignity, degree; And thus these mighty things were made to be. WRITTEN AT MYCENÆ. I saw a weird procession glide along The vestibule ??????? ????. Elect. 1391. before the Lion's gate; This piece of Archaic sculpture is very spirited; I think the Lions could not have had their heads as Clarke describes; they must have been thrown more back, like the Lions rampant in our heraldic bearings. A Man of godlike limb and warrior state, Who never looked behind him, led the throng; Next a pale Girl, singing sweet sorrow, met My eyes, who ever pointed to a fleck Of ingrained crimson on her marble neck; Her a fierce Woman, armed with knife and net, Close followed, whom a Youth pursued with smile, Once mild, now bitter-mad, himself the while Pursued by three foul Shapes, gory and grey: Dread family! . . . I saw another day The phantom of that Youth, sitting alone, Quiet, thought-bound, a stone upon a stone. GRECIAN SUNSET. The modern Greek phrase for the setting of the sun is ?????????? ? ?????,? “the sun reigns,” or “the sun is a king.” One interpretation of this expression was given me, viz., that in the vesper anthem beginning with the words, ??? ?????? ?????????,? “the Lord reigns,” the action was transferred to the sun itself, in the same feeling as the “Ave Maria” is the synonym of the close of an Italian day. Another explanation I have formed into the following lines. In perfect Kingliness now reigns the Sun; At morn, as one who girds himself for speed, A Hero prompt to do a mighty deed, And not to rest until the deed be done, He rose:—at noon he wore the guise of one, Who feels the purpose that his will decreed Half-perfect, and goes onward to his meed, Stronger than were his labour just begun; And now his aim attained, his triumph known, In conscious dignity he mounts his throne Of golden air, and ere the eve can spread Her pale-rose veil above his royal head, No courtier clouds around him, to the bed Of a victorious rest, he passes all alone. A GRECIAN THUNDER-STORM. The Thunder came not with one awful pulse, When the wide Heaven seems quaking to its heart, But in a current of tumultuous noise, Crash upon crash,—a multitudinous clang Of cymbals beating in the low-hung clouds,— And every shortest interspace filled up With echoes vivid as their parent sounds. The lightning came not in one flash of light, Soon yielding to the darkness, (which ere long Is routed by another wingèd blaze,) But with no pause, and swaying to and fro, As if the common air was turned to flame. So mused I, from this hot and furious scene Drawing a timely lesson of calm Truth, So,—when great nations are awake at heart, And rise embattled, from an ancient sleep Sudden aroused by some consummate deed Of reckless tyranny, or glad to stand For heir-loom rights, familiar liberties, Through pain and loss and terror, unto death,— Should be the expression of their energies,— Earnest, intense, impassioned as you will, But with no pause; the fruit is Victory. CORINTH, ON LEAVING GREECE. I stood upon that great Acropolis, The turret-gate of Nature's citadel, Where once again, from slavery's thick abyss Strangely delivered, Grecian warriors dwell. I watched the bosom of Parnassus swell, I traced Eleusis, Athens, Salamis, And that rude fane It is very curious that some awkward ill-proportioned ruins should be the only memorials of that Corinth, whose exquisite refinement in all that could charm and embellish life was a proverb with the world, and who extended her existence so far into the later domains of Roman time. It may be that there was some sanctity attached to this temple, from its very age and ungainliness, which preserved it amid the annihilation of other more sumptuous and polished edifices. below, which lives to tell Where reigned the City of luxurious bliss. Within the maze of great Antiquity My spirit wandered tremblingly along;— As one who with rapt ears to a wild song Hearkens some while,—then knows not whether he Has comprehended all its melody, So in that parting hour was it with Greece and me. MODERN GREECE. As, in the legend which our childhood loved, The destined prince was guided to the bed, Where, many a silent year, the charmèd Maid Lay still, as though she were not; nor could wake, Till the first touch of his appointed hand With the deep fountains of her subtle being Made sympathy, and in her virgin bosom The pulse of breath, that so long had beat on Its regular measure, trembled and grew fast, And the long fringes parted on her eyes,— And she to her old world of light and sense Was born again; so the Invisible Power, Whose awful presence is upon our earth Above all dominations, came at last To Greece, and laid the magic of his hand Upon her sleep, and she obedient rose. She rose, but not as that enchanted ladie, To whose unsullied beauty sleep had been But as a veil, to guard off impure Time From breathing on it, and had left no trace Of its existence, but the long gold hair, That, like a vestment, folded round her form; Nor, even as they, who on this vulgar orb Rise from their night's brief slumbers, hale and fresh, With all the toil of yesterday behind them;— No, Nations sleep not thus,—their sleep and rest Has more of death about it,—in its hours Silent corruption works, and slow decay; And when some special grace bids them awake, Half-blinded, with worn hearts, and sense confused, They rush in fury from their couch of shame, Proclaim themselves new-born, and free, and young, Nothing of youth about them, but its passions, Its vigorous lusts, and recklessness of ends.— Oh! would'st Thou, from thy hot delirious dream, Look out upon the calm of long-past time, Thine own bright natural youth, willing to learn; Would only Greece remember what she was, And then what made her so;—would she remember That distant History records a time, Though in the splendour of the after-light Nearly obliterate, when she was as bare Of every element of social being, Of every use of moral energies, Of all that can transform humanity From the wild warrior-savage, instinct-led, Into the thinking, acting citizen, As now, or more so; but her infant soul, Soon from that rude and miserable state, Into a youth of healthy-springing thoughts, Gay simple fancies, aspirations high, Expanded under tutelary care Of two wise nurses, delegates of God, The Love of Beauty and Self-sacrifice: And when, in the full time, came slowly on Life's manly mood, and consciousness mature, She, the fair faith and natural impulses That waited on her morning, taking up Into the accomplished glory of her noon, Never forgot, through all the growth of wealth, And martial action, and scholastic pride, Her first affections,—and possessed at once, A Mind informed by sage experience, And a Heart fresh as it had come from heaven. What, though the curse of this unresting world, The influence that will let no greatness be, Merged in the blackness of barbaric night, This model of the perfect equipoise, And just appliance of all human powers; Yet still for You, born of a second dawn, The children of another germ of life, It has a voice of loud authority; By the same laws it bids you train your minds, To the same tutelage submit your hearts, And to the sum of wisdom there laid up, Adding the priceless gems of Christian truth, Be owners of a treasury of such wealth, As all the spirit of nations has not known. ON RETURNING TO GREECE IN 1842. Ten years ago I deemed that if once more I trod on Grecian soil, 'twould be to find The presence of a great informing mind That should the glorious past somewise restore; And now I cry, with disappointment sore, “Is it for this that Greece has striven and pined,— These her rich vales with scarce a labouring hind, These silent havens on this faded shore?” Still patience—patience with the toils of Time; The air of freedom is not always health, Yet vain without it every hope sublime: Better a nation's growth, however slow, That is its own, than any strength or wealth Conferred or cultured by a friend or foe. DELPHI. AN ELEGY. Beneath the vintage moon's uncertain light, And some faint stars that pierced the film of cloud, Stood those Parnassian peaks before my sight, Whose fame throughout the ancient world was loud. Still could I dimly trace the terraced lines Diverging from the cliffs on either side; A theatre whose steps were filled with shrines And rich devices of Hellenic pride; Though brightest daylight would have lit in vain The place whence gods and worshippers had fled; Only, and they too tenantless, remain The hallowed chambers of the pious dead. Yet those wise architects an ample part To Nature gave in their religious shows, And thus, amid the sepultures of Art, Still rise the Rocks and still the Fountain flows. Desolate Delphi! pure Castalian spring! Hear me avow that I am not as they— Who deem that all about you ministering Were base impostors, and mankind their prey: That the high names they seemed to love and laud Were but the tools their paltry trade to ply; This pomp of Faith a mere gigantic fraud, The apparatus of a mighty lie! Let those that will believe it; I, for one, Cannot thus read the history of my kind; Remembering all this little Greece has done To raise the universal human mind: I know that hierarchs of that wondrous race, By their own faith alone, could keep alive Mysterious rites and sanctity of place,— Believing in whate'er they might contrive. It may be, that these influences, combined With such rare nature as the priestess bore, Brought to the surface of her stormy mind Distracted fragments of prophetic lore: For, howsoe'er to mortals' probing view Creation is revealed, yet must we pause, Weak to dissect the futile from the true, Where'er imagination spreads her laws. So now that dimmer grows the watery light, And things each moment more fantastic seem, I fain would seek if still the Gods have might Over the undissembling world of dream: I ask not that for me aside be cast The solemn veil that hides what is decreed; I crave the resurrection of the past, That I may know what Delphi was indeed! Oct. 8th, 1842. THE TOMB OF LAIUS. Where Delphi's consecrated pass Bœotia's misty region faces, At the “Schiste Hodos,” or “Triodos.” Rises a tomb-like stony mass Amid the bosky mountain-bases; It seems no work of human care, But many rocks split off from one: Laius, the Theban king, lies there,— His murderer Œdipus, his son. No pilgrim to the Pythian shrine But marked the spot with decent awe, In presence of a power divine, O'erruling human will and law: And to some thoughtful hearts that scene— Those paths, that mound, those browsing herds, Were more than e'er that tale had been, Arrayed in Sophoclean words. So is it yet,—no time or space That ancient anguish can assuage, For sorrow is of every race, And suffering due from every age; That awful legend falls to us With all the weight that Greece could feel, And every man is Œdipus, Whose wounds no mortal skill can heal. Oh! call it Providence or fate, The Sphynx propounds the riddle still, That Man must bear and expiate Loads of involuntary ill: So shall Endurance ever hold The foremost rank 'mid human needs, Not without faith, that God can mould To good the dross of evil deeds. THE FLOWERS OF HELICON. It is of importance to remind the traveller from Delphi to Attica, to take the mountain road from Lebadea over the plateau of Helicon, and not the new one along the plain: the latter is the carriage-road of Greece, but has no other recommendation. The solitudes of Helicon Are rife with gay and scented flowers, Shining the marble rocks upon, Or 'mid the valley's oaken bowers; And ever since young Fancy placed The Hieron of the Muses here, Have ceaseless generations graced This airy Temple year by year. But those more bright, more precious, flowers With which old Greece the Muses woo'd, The Art whose varied forms and powers Charmed the poetic multitude, The Thought that from each deep recess And fissure of the teeming mind Sent up its odorous fruitfulness— What have those glories left behind? For from those generous calices The vegetative virtue shed, Flew over distant lands and seas, Waking wide nations from the dead; And e'er the parent plants o'erthrown Gave place to rank and noisome weed, The giant Roman world was sown Throughout with that ennobling seed. And downward thence to latest days The heritage of Beauty fell, And Grecian forms and Grecian lays Prolonged their humanising spell, Till, when new worlds for man to win The Atlantic's riven waves disclose, The wildernesses there begin To blossom with the Grecian rose. And all this while in barren shame Their native land remote reclines, A mocked and miserable name Round which some withered ivy twines: Where, wandering 'mid the broken tombs, The remnant of the race forget That ever with such royal blooms This Garden of the Soul was set. O breezes of the wealthy West! Why bear ye not on grateful wings The seeds of all your life has blest Back to their being's early springs? Why fill ye not these plains with hopes To bear the treasures once they bore, And to these Heliconian slopes Transport civility and lore? For now, at least, the soil is free, Now that one strong reviving breath Has chased that Eastern tyranny Which to the Greek was ever death: Now that, though weak with age and wrongs, And bent beneath the recent chain This motherland of Greece belongs To her own western world again. MODERN ATHENS. If Fate, though jealous of the second birth Of names in history raised to high degree, Permits that Athens yet once more shall be, Let her be placed as suits the thought and worth Of those, who, during long oppression's dearth, Went out from Hydra and Ipsara free, Making their homestead of the chainless sea, And hardly touching their enslavèd earth. So on the shore, in sight of Salamis, On the Piræan and Phalerian bays, With no harsh contrast of what was and is, Let Athens rise; while in the distance stands, Like something hardly raised by human hands, The awful skeleton of ancient days! DELOS. Though Syra's rock was passed at morn, The wind so faintly arched the sail, That ere to Delos we were borne, The autumn day began to fail, And only in Diana's smiles We reached the bay between the isles. In sweet serenity of force She ruled the Heavens without a star— A sacred image that the course Of time and thought can hardly mar,— As dear and nearly as divine As ever in Ephesian shrine. I knew that on the spot I trod Her glorious twins Latona bore, That for her sake the pitying God Had fixed the isle afloat before; And, fearful of his just disdain, I almost felt it move again. For the delicious light that threw Such clear transparence on the wave, From the black mastick-bushes drew Column, and frieze, and architrave, Like rocks, which, native to the place, Had something of mysterious grace. “Strong was the power of Art to bid Arise such beauty out of stone, Yet Paros might as well have hid Its wealth within its breast unknown, As for brute Nature to regain The fragments of the fallen fane. “Who can rebuild these colonnades Where met the ancient festal host, The peasant from Arcadia's glades, The merchant from Ionia's coast, Gladdening their Grecian blood to stand On one religious Fatherland?” So in my angry discontent I cried, but calmer thoughts came on, And gratitude with sorrow blent, And murmur turned to orison: I thanked the Gods for what had been, And Nature for the present scene. I felt that while in Greece remained Signs of that old heroic show, Hope, Memory's sister, so sustained, Would sink not altogether low, And Grecian hearts once more might be Combined in powerful amity. ... Long ere the sun's most curious ray Had touched the morning's zone of pearl, I and my boat were far away, Raised on the water's freshening curl; And barely 'twixt the rose and blue The island's rim was still in view. So Delos rests upon my mind, A perfect Vision of the night, A picture by moon-rays designed, And shaded into black and bright,— A true Idea borne away, Untroubled by the dreamless day. MEMORIALS OF TRAVELS IN ITALY. Sempre vivete, o cari arti divine, Conforto a nostra sventurata gente, Fra l' itale ruine Gl' itali pregi a celebrare intente. G. Leopard. AN ITALIAN TO ITALY. 1831. Along the coast of those bright seas, Where sternly fought of old The Pisan and the Genoese, Into the evening gold A ship was sailing fast, Beside whose swaying mast There leant a youth;—his eye's extended scope Took in the scene, ere all the twilight fell; And, more in blessing than in hope, He murmured,—“Fare-thee-well. “Not that thou gav'st my fathers birth, And not that thou hast been The terror of the ancient earth And Christendom's sole Queen; But that thou wert and art The beauty of my heart:— Now with a lover's love I pray to thee, As in my passionate youth-time erst I prayed; Now, with a lover's agony, I see thy features fade. “They tell me thou art deeply low; They brand thee weak and vile; The cruel Northman tells me so, And pities me the while: What can he know of thee, Glorified Italy? Never has Nature to his infant mouth Bared the full summer of her living breast; Never the warm and mellow South To his young lips was prest. “I know,—and thought has often striven The justice to approve,— I know that all that God has given Is given us to love; But still I have a faith, Which must endure till death, That Beauty is the mother of all Love; And Patriot Love can never purely glow Where frowns the veilèd heaven above, And the niggard earth below. “The wealth of high ancestral name, And silken household ties, And battle-fields' memorial fame, He earnestly may prize Who loves and honours not The country of his lot, With undiscerning piety,—the same Filial religion, be she great and brave, Or sunk in sloth and red with shame, A monarch or a slave. “But He who calls this heaven his own, The very lowliest one, Is conscious of a holier zone, And nearer to the sun: Ever it bids him hail, Cloud-feathered and clear pale, Or one vast dome of deep immaculate blue, Or, when the moon is on her mid-year throne, With richer but less brilliant hue, Built up of turkis stone. “The springing corn that steeped in light Looks emerald, between The delicate olive-branches, dight In reverend gray-green; Each flower with open breast, To the gale it loves the best; The bland outbreathings of the midland sea, The aloe-fringed and myrtle-shadowed shore, Are precious things,—Oh, wo the be Must they be mine no more? “And shall the matin bell awake My native village crowd, To kneel at shrines, whose pomp would make A Northern city proud? And shall the festival Of closing Carnival Bid the gay laughers thro' those arches pour, Whose marble mass confronts its parent hill, —And I upon a far bleak shore! My heart will see them still. “For though in poverty and fear, Thou think'st upon the morrow, Dutiful Art is ever near, To wile thee from all sorrow; Thou hast a power of melody, To lull all sense of slavery; Thy floral crown is blowing still to blow, Thy eye of glory ceases not to shine, And so long as these things be so, I feel thee, bless thee, mine!” WRITTEN IN PETRARCH'S HOUSE AT ARQUA, AMONG THE EUGANEAN HILLS. Petrarch! I would that there might be In this thy household sanctuary No visible monument of thee: The Fount that whilom played before thee, The Roof that rose in shelter o'er thee, The low fair Hills that still adore thee,— I would no more; thy memory Must loathe all cold reality, Thought-worship only is for thee. They say thy Tomb lies there below; What want I with the marble show? I am content,—I will not go: For though by Poesy's high grace Thou saw'st, in thy calm resting-place, God, Love, and Nature face to face; Yet now that thou art wholly free, How can it give delight to see That sign of thy captivity? FEELINGS EXCITED BY SOME MILITARY MANŒUVRES AT VERONA. What is the lesson I have brought away, After the moment's palpitating glee? What has this pomp of men, this strong array Of thousands and ten thousands been to me? Did I find nothing but the vision gay, The mere phenomenon that all could see? Did I feel nothing but the brute display Of Power,—the show of centred energy? Trembling and humbled, I was taught how hard It is for our strait minds at once to scan The might of banded numbers, and regard The individual soul, the living Man; To use mechanic multitudes, and yet Our common human feelings not forget! MEDITATIVE FRAGMENTS, ON VENICE. I. “The ruler of the Adriatic, who never was infant nor stripling, whom God took by the right hand and taught to walk by himself the first hour.”— Landor. Walk in St. Mark's, the time, the ample space Lies in the freshness of the evening shade, When, on each side, with gravely darkened face, The masses rise above the light arcade; Walk down the midst with slowly-tunèd pace, But gay withal,—for there is high parade Of fair attire and fairer forms, which pass Like varying groups on a magician's glass. From broad-illumined chambers far within, Or under curtains daintily outspread, Music, and laugh, and talk, the motley din Of all who from sad thought or toil are sped, Here a chance hour of social joy to win, Gush forth,—but I love best, above my head To feel nor arch nor tent, nor anything But that pure Heaven's eternal covering. It is one broad Saloon, one gorgeous Hall; A chamber, where a multitude, all Kings, May hold full audience, splendid festival, Or Piety's most pompous ministerings; Thus be its height unmarred,—thus be it all One mighty room, whose form direct upsprings To the o'er-arching sky;—it is right good, When Art and Nature keep such brotherhood. For where, upon the firmest sodden land, Has ever Monarch's power and toil of slaves Equalled the works of that self-governed band, Who fixed the Delos of the Adrian waves; Planting upon these strips of yielding sand A Temple of the Beautiful, which braves The jealous strokes of ocean, nor yet fears The far more perilous sea, “whose waves are years?” Walk in St. Mark's again, some few hours after, When a bright sleep is on each storied pile,— When fitful music, and inconstant laughter, Give place to Nature's silent moonlight smile: Now Fancy wants no faery gale to waft her To Magian haunt, or charm-engirded isle, All too content, in passive bliss, to see This show divine of visible Poetry:— On such a night as this impassionedly The old Venetian sung those verses rare, “That Venice must of needs eternal be, For Heaven had looked through the pellucid air, And cast its reflex in the crystal sea, And Venice was the image pictured there “Ich hörte einen blinden Sänger in Chioggia, der sang, Venedig sey eine ewige Stadt; der Himmel hätte sich im Meer gespiegelt und sein Widerschein wäre Venedig.”—Platen.;” I hear them now, and tremble, for I seem As treading on an unsubstantial dream. Who talks of vanished glory, of dead power, Of things that were, and are not? Is he here? Can he take in the glory of this hour, And call it all the decking of a bier? No, surely as on that Titanic tower The Campanile. The Guardian Angel stands in æther clear, With the moon's silver tempering his gold wing, So Venice lives, as lives no other thing:— That strange Cathedral! exquisitely strange,— That front, on whose bright varied tints the eye Rests as of gems,—those arches, whose high range Gives its rich-broidered border to the sky,— Those ever-prancing steeds!—My friend, whom change Of restless will has led to lands that lie Deep in the East, does not thy fancy set Above those domes an airy minaret? Dost thou not feel, that in this scene are blent Wide distances of the estrangèd earth, Far thoughts, far faiths, beseeming her who bent The spacious Orient to her simple worth, Who, in her own young freedom eminent, Scorning the slaves that shamed their ancient birth, And feeling what the West could be, had been, Went out a Traveller, and returned a Queen? II. The Golden Book The Libro d'Oro, the Venetian “Peerage. ” Is now unwritten in, and stands unmoved, Save when the curious traveller takes down A random volume, from the dusty shelf, To trace the progress of a bruited name; The Bucentaur Is shattered, and of its resplendent form There is no remnant, but some splintered morsel, Which in his cabin, as a talisman, Mournfully hangs the pious Gondolier; The Adrian sea Will never have a Doge to marry more,— The meagre favours of a foreign lord Can hardly lead some score of humble craft With vilest merchandize into the port, That whilom held the wealth of half a world. Thy Palaces Are bartered to the careful Israelite,— Or left to perish, stone by stone, worn down In desolation,—solemn skeletons, Whose nakedness some tufts of pitying grass, Or green boughs trembling o'er the trembling wall, Adorn but hide not. And are these things true, Miraculous Venice? Is the charm then past Away from thee? Is all thy work fulfilled, Of power and beauty? Art thou gatherèd To the dead cities? Is thy ministry Made up, and folded in the hand of Thought? Ask him who knows the meaning and the truth Of all existence;—ask the Poet's heart: Thy Book has no dead tome for him,—for him Within St. Mark's emblazoned porticoes, Thy old Nobility are walking still;— The lowliest Gondola upon thy waters Is worth to him thy decorated Galley; He never looks upon the Adrian sea But as thy lawful tho' too faithless Spouse; And when, in the sad lustre of the moon, Thy Palaces seem beautifully wan, He blesses God that there is left on earth So marvellous, so full an antidote, For all the racks and toils of mortal life, As thy sweet countenance to gaze upon. III. LIDO. I went to greet the full May-moon On that long narrow shoal Which lies between the still Lagoon And the open Ocean's roll. How pleasant was that grassy shore, When one for months had been Shut up in streets,—to feel once more One's foot-fall on the green! There are thick trees too in that place; But straight from sea to sea, Over a rough uncultured space, The path goes drearily. I passed along, with many a bound, To hail the fresh free wave; But, pausing, wonderingly found I was treading on a grave. Then, at one careless look, I saw That, for some distance round, Tomb-stones, without design or law, Were scattered on the ground: Of pirates or of mariners I deemed that these might be The fitly-chosen sepulchres, Encircled by the sea. But there were words inscribed on all, I' the tongue of a far land, And marks of things symbolical, I could not understand. They are the graves of that sad race, Who, from their Syrian home, For ages, without resting-place, Are doomed in woe to roam; Who, in the days of sternest faith, Glutted the sword and flame, As if a taint of moral death Were in their very name: And even under laws most mild, All shame was deemed their due, And the nurse told the Christian child To shun the cursèd Jew. Thus all their gold's insidious grace Availed not here to gain For their last sleep, a seemlier place Than this bleak-featured plain. Apart, severely separate, On the verge of the outer sea, Their home of Death is desolate As their Life's home could be. The common sand-path had defaced And pressed down many a stone; Others can be but faintly traced I' the rank grass o'er them grown. I thought of Shylock,—the fierce heart Whose wrongs and injuries old Temper, in Shakspeare's world of Art, His lusts of blood and gold; Perchance that form of broken pride Here at my feet once lay,— But lay alone,—for at his side There was no Jessica! Fondly I love each island-shore, Embraced by Adrian waves; But none has Memory cherished more Than Lido and its graves. IV. Oh Poverty! thou bitter-hearted fiend! How darest thou approach the Beautiful? How darest thou give up these Palaces, Where delicate Art in wood and marble wove Its noblest fancies, with laborious skill, To the base uses of the artizan? How darest thou defile with coarsest stores, And vermin's loathsome nests, the aged walls, Whence Titian's women burningly looked down On the rich-vested pomp that shone below? Is nothing sacred for thy hand, no names, No memories,—thou bold Iniquity! Shall men, on whose fine brows we recognize The lines of some great ducal effigies, Which frown along St. John's cathedral aisles, The Venetian Pantheon of S. Giovanni e Paolo. With hearts as high as any of their fathers, Sink silent under thy slow martyrdom, Leaving their children, Liberty's just heirs, Children like those that Gianbellini painted, e.g. In the refectories of the Redentore and Frari. To batten on the miserable alms, The sordid fragments of their country's wealth, Doled out by servants of a stranger king? Is there no engine of compassionate Death, Which with a rapid mercy will relieve This ancient city of its shamèd being? Is War so weary that he cannot strike One iron blow, that she may fold her robe About her head, and fall imperially? Is there no eager earthquake far below, To shiver her frail limbs, and hurl her down Into the bosom of her mated sea? Or must she, for a lapse of wretched years, Armless and heartless, tremble on as now, Like one who hears the tramp of murderous foes, Unseen, and feels them nearer, nearer still;— Till round her Famine's pestilential breath, Fatally closing, to the gloom of Time, She shall, in quivering agony, give up The spirit of that light, which burnt so long, A stedfast glory, an unfailing fire? Thus ran the darkling current of my thoughts, As one sad night, from the Rialto's edge, I looked into the waters,—on whose face Glimmered the reflex of some few faint stars, And two far-flitting lamps of gondoliers, That seemed on that black flat to move alone, While, on each side, each well-known building lost Its separate beauty in one dark long curve. V. City, whose name did once adorn the world, Thou might'st have been all that thou ever wert, In form and feature and material strength, Up from the sea, which is thy pedestal, Unto thy Campanile's golden top, And yet have never won the precious crown, To be the loved of human hearts, to be The wise man's treasure now and evermore.— Th' ingenious boldness, the creative will, Which from some weak uncertain plots of sand, Cast up among the waters, could erect Foundations firm as on the central ground,— The art which changed thy huts to palaces, And bade the God of Ocean's temples rise Conspicuous far above the crystal plain,— The ever-active nerve of Industry, That bound the Orient to the Occident In fruitful commerce, till thy lap was filled With wealth, the while thy head was girt with power; Each have their separate palm from wondering men, But the sage thinker's passion must have source In sympathy entire with that rare spirit Which did possess thee, as thy very life,— That power of union and self-sacrifice, Which from the proud republics of old time Devolved upon thee, by a perfect faith Strung to a tenfold deeper energy. Within thy people's mind immutable Two notions held associate monarchy, Religion and the State,—to which alone, In their full freedom, they declared themselves Subject, and deemed this willing servitude Their dearest privilege of liberty. Thus at the call of either sacred cause, All wealth, all feelings, all peculiar rights, Were made one universal holocaust, Without a thought of pain,—thus all thy sons Bore thee a love, not vague and hard defined, But close and personal, a love no force Could take away, no coldness could assuage. Thus when the noble body of Italy, Which God has bound in one by Alps and sea, Was struggling with torn heart and splintered limbs, So that the very marrow of her strength Mixed with the lavished gore and oozed away,— Town banded against town, street against street, House against house, and father against son, The servile victims of unmeaning feuds,— Thou didst sustain the wholeness of thy power,— Thy altar was as a domestic hearth, Round which thy children sat in brotherhood;— Never was name of Guelf or Ghibelline Writ on thy front in letters of bright blood; Never the stranger, for his own base ends, Flattered thy passions, or by proffered gold Seduced the meanest of thy citizens.— Thus too the very sufferers of thy wrath, Whom the unsparing prudence of the state, For erring judgment, insufficient zeal, Or heavier fault, had banished from its breast, Even they, when came on thee thy hour of need, Fell at thy feet and prayed, with humble tears, That thou wouldst deign at least to use their wealth, Though thou didst scorn the gift of their poor lives. As in the instance of Antonio Grimani, who was living in exile at Rome at the time of the league of Cambray. He had been condemned for some error in fighting against the Turks. When Venice was in distress, he offered all his private fortune to the state. After her victory he was not only recalled, but elected Doge some years later. Prime model of a Christian commonwealth! Thou wise simplicity, which present men Calumniate, not conceiving,—joy is mine, That I have read and learnt thee as I ought, Not in the crude compiler's painted shell, But in thine own memorials of live stone, And in the pictures of thy kneeling princes, And in the lofty words on lofty tombs, And in the breath of ancient chroniclers, And in the music of the outer sea. THE VENETIAN SERENADE. When along the light ripple the far serenade Has accosted the ear of each passionate maid, She may open the window that looks on the stream,— She may smile on her pillow and blend it in dream; Half in words, half in music, it pierces the gloom, “I am coming—Stalì—but you know not for whom! Stalì—not for whom!” Now the tones become clearer,—you hear more and more How the water divided returns on the oar,— Does the prow of the gondola strike on the stair? Do the voices and instruments pause and prepare? Oh! they faint on the ear as the lamp on the view, “I am passing—Premì—but I stay not for you! Premì—not for you!” Then return to your couch, you who stifle a tear, Then awake not, fair sleeper—believe he is here; For the young and the loving no sorrow endures, If to-day be another's, to-morrow is yours;— May, the next time you listen, your fancy be true, “I am coming—Sciàr—and for you and to you! Sciàr—and to you!” The Venetian words here used are the calls of the gondoliers, indicating the direction in which they are rowing. Sciare is to stop the boat. FROM GÖTHE. Let me this gondola boat compare to the slumberous cradle, And to a spacious bier liken the cover demure; Thus on the Great Canal through life we are swaying and swimming Onward with never a care, coffin and cradle between. A DREAM IN A GONDOLA. I had a dream of waters: I was borne Fast down the slimy tide Of eldest Nile, and endless flats forlorn Stretched out on either side,— Save where from time to time arose Red Pyramids, like flames in forced repose, And Sphynxes gazed, vast countenances bland, Athwart that river-sea and sea of sand. It is the nature of the Life of Dream, To make all action of our mental springs, Howe'er unnatural, discrepant, and strange, Be as the unfolding of most usual things; And thus to me no wonder did there seem, When, by a subtle change, The heavy ample byblus-wingèd boat, In which I lay afloat, Became a deft canoe, light-wove Of painted bark, gay-set with lustrous shells, Faintingly rocked within a lonesome cove, Of some rich island where the Indian dwells; Below, the water's pure white light Took colour from reflected blooms, And, through the forest's deepening glooms, Birds of illuminated plumes Came out like stars in summer night: And close beside, all fearless and serene, Within a niche of drooping green, A girl, with limbs fine-rounded and clear-brown, And hair thick-waving down, Advancing one small foot, in beauty stood, Trying the temper of the lambent flood. But on my spirit in that spicèd air Embalmed, and in luxurious senses drowned, Another change of sweet and fair There passed, and of the scene around Nothing remained the same in sight or sound: For now the Wanderer of my dream Was gliding down a fable-stream Of long-dead Hellas, with much treasure Of inworking thoughtful pleasure; While the silver line meanders Through the tall pink oleanders, Through the wood of tufted rushes, Through the arbute's ruby-bushes, Voices of a happy hymn Every moment grow less dim, Till at last the slim caïque (Hollowed from a single stem Of a hill-brow's diadem) Rests in a deep-dented creek Myrtle-ambushed,—and above Songs, the very breath of Love, Stream from Temples reverend-old, Porticoes of Doric mould, Snow-white islands of devotion, Planted in the rose and gold Of the evening's æther-ocean;— O joyant Earth! belovèd Grecian sky! O favoured Wanderer—honoured dreamer I! Yet not less favoured when awake,—for now, Across my torpid brow Swept a cool current of the young night's air, With a sharp kiss, and there Was I all clear awake,—drawn soft along There in my own dear Gondola, among The bright-eyed Venice isles, Lit up in constant smiles.— What had my thoughts and heart to do With wild Egyptain bark, or frail canoe, Or mythic skiff out of Saturnian days, When I was there, with that rare scene to praise, That Gondola to rest in and enjoy, That actual bliss to taste without alloy? Cradler of placid pleasures, deep delights, Bosomer of the Poet's wearied mind, Tempter from vulgar passions, scorns and spites, Enfolder of all feelings that be kind! Before our souls thy quiet motions spread, In one great calm, one undivided plain, Immediate joy, blest memories of the dead, And iris-tinted forms of hope's domain, Child of the still Lagoons! Open to every show Of summer sunsets and autumnal moons, Such as no other space of world can know,— Dear Boat, that makest dear Whatever thou com'st near,— In thy repose still let me gently roam, Still on thy couch of beauty find a home; Still let me share thy comfortable peace With all I have of dearest upon Earth, Friend, mistress, sister; and when death's release Shall call my spirit to another birth, Would that I might thus lightly lapse away, Alone,—by moonlight,—in a Gondola. ON THE MAD-HOUSE AT VENICE. “I looked and saw between us and the sun A building on an island, such an one As age to age might add, for uses vile, A windowless, deformed, and dreary pile; And on the top an open tower, where hung A bell, which in the radiance swayed and swung,— We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue; The broad sun sank behind it, and it tolled In strong and black relief. ‘What we behold Shall be the Madhouse and its belfry tower,’ Said Maddalo.” Shelley. Honour aright the philosophic thought, That they who, by the trouble of the brain Or heart, for usual life are overwrought, Hither should come to discipline their pain. A single convent on a shoaly plain Of waters never changing their dull face But by the sparkles of thick-falling rain Or lines of puny waves,—such is the place. Strong medicine enters by the ear and eye; That low unaltering dash against the wall May lull the angriest dream to vacancy; And Melancholy, finding nothing strange, For her poor self to jar upon at all, Frees her sad-centred thoughts, and gives them pleasant range. TO ? WRITTEN AT VENICE. Not only through the golden haze Of indistinct surprise, With which the Ocean-bride displays Her pomp to stranger eyes;— Not with the fancy's flashing play, The traveller's vulgar theme, Where following objects chase away The moment's dazzling dream;— Not thus art thou content to see The City of my love,— Whose beauty is a thought to me All mortal thoughts above; And pass in dull unseemly haste, Nor sight nor spirit clear, As if the first bewildering taste Were all the banquet here! When the proud Sea, for Venice' sake, Itself consents to wear The semblance of a land-locked lake, Inviolably fair; And in the dalliance of her Isles, Has levelled his strong waves, Adoring her with tenderer wiles, Than his own pearly caves,— Surely may we to similar calm Our noisy lives subdue, And bare our bosoms to such balm As God has given to few; Surely may we delight to pause On our care-goaded road, Refuged from Time's most bitter laws In this august abode. Thou knowest this,—thou lingerest here, Rejoicing to remain; The plashing oars fall on thy ear Like a familiar strain; No wheel prolongs its weary roll, The Earth itself goes round Slower than elsewhere, and thy soul Dreams in the void of sound. Thy heart, by Nature's discipline, From all disdain refined, Kept open to be written in By good of every kind, Can harmonise its inmost sense To every outward tone, And bring to all experience High reasoning of its own. So, when these forms come freely out, And wonder is gone by, With patient skill it sets about Its subtle work of joy; Connecting all it comprehends By lofty moods of love,— The earthly Present's farthest ends,— The Past's deep Heaven above. O bliss! to watch, with half-shut lid, By many a secret place, Where darkling loveliness is hid, And undistinguished grace, To mark the gloom, by slow degrees, Exfoliate, till the whole Shines forth before our sympathies, A soul that meets a soul! Come out upon the broad Lagoon, Come for the hundredth time,— Our thoughts shall make a pleasant tune, Our words a worthy rhyme; And thickly round us we will set Such visions as were seen, By Tizian and by Tintorett, And dear old Giambellin,— And all their peers in art, whose eyes, Taught by this sun and sea, Flashed on their works those burning dyes, That fervent poetry; And wove the shades so thinly-clear They would be parts of light In northern climes, where frowns severe Mar half the charms of sight.— Did ever shape that Paolo drew Put on such brilliant tire, As Nature, in this evening view,— This world of tinted fire? The glory into whose embrace, The virgin pants to rise, Is but reflected from the face Of these Venetian skies. The sun, beneath the horizon's brow Has sunk, not passed away; His presence is far lordlier now Than on the throne of day; His spirit of splendour has gone forth, Sloping wide violet rays, Possessing air and sea and earth With his essential blaze. The perfect transparency and rich colour of all objects, and their reflections, in southern countries, for some short time after sunset, has an almost miraculous effect to a northern eye. Whenever it has been imitated in art, it has been generally pronounced unnatural or exaggerated. I do not remember to have ever seen the phenomenon so astonishingly beautiful as a Venice, at least in Italy. Transpierced, transfused, each densest mass Melts to as pure a glow, As images on painted glass Or silken screens can show. Gaze on the city,—contemplate With that fine sense of thine The Palace of the ancient state,— That wildly-grand design! How 'mid the universal sheen Of marble amber-tinged, Like some enormous baldaquin Gay-chequered and deep-fringed, It stands in air and will not move, Upheld by magic power,— The dun-lead Domes just caught above— Beside,—the glooming Tower. Now a more distant beauty fills Thy scope of ear and eye,— That graceful cluster of low hills, Bounding the western sky, Which the ripe evening flushes cover With purplest fruitage-bloom,— Methinks that gold-lipt cloud may hover Just over Petrarch's tomb! Petrarch! when we that name repeat, Its music seems to fall Like distant bells, soft-voiced and sweet, But sorrowful withal;— That broken heart of love!—that life Of tenderness and tears! So weak on earth,—in earthly strife,— So strong in holier spheres! How in his most of godlike pride, While emulous nations ran To kiss his feet, he stept aside And wept the woes of man! How in his genius-woven bower Of passion ever green, The world's black veil fell, hour by hour, Him and his rest between. Welcome such thoughts;—they well atone With this more serious mood Of visible things that night brings on, In her cool shade to brood; The moon is clear in heaven and sea, Her silver has been long Slow-changing to bright gold, but she Deserves a separate song. TO THE MOON OF THE SOUTH. Let him go down,—the gallant Sun! His work is nobly done; Well may He now absorb Within his solid orb The rays so beautiful and strong, The rays that have been out so long Embracing this delighted land as with a mystic song. Let the brave Sun go down to his repose, And though his heart be kind, He need not mourn for those He leaves behind; He knows, that when his ardent throne Is rolled beyond the vaulting sky, The Earth shall not be left alone In darkness and perplexity. We shall not sit in sullen sorrow Expectant of a tardy morrow, But there where he himself arose, Another power shall rise, And gracious rivalry disclose To our reverted eyes, Between the passing splendour and the born, Which can the most our happy world adorn. The light of night shall rise,— Not as in northern skies, A memory of the day, a dream Of sunshine, something that might seem Between a shadow and a gleam, A mystery, a maiden Whose spirit worn and sorrow laden Pleasant imaginations wile Into a visionary smile, A novice veiled in vapoury shrouds, A timid huntress, whom the clouds Rather pursue than shun,— With far another mien, Wilt Thou come forth serene, Thou full and perfect Queen, Moon of the South! twin-sister of the Sun! Still harboured in his tent of cloth of gold He seems thy ordered presence to await, In his pure soul rejoicing to behold The majesty of his successor's state,— Saluting thy ascent With many a tender and triumphant tone Compassing in his celestial instrument, And harmonies of hue to other climes unknown. He, too, who knows what melody of word May with that visual music best accord, Why does the Bard his homage now delay? As in the ancient East, The royal Minstrel-Priest Sang to his harp that Hallelujah lay Of the Sun-bridegroom ready for his way, So, in the regions of the later West This blessed even-tide, Is there no Poet whose divine behest Shall be to hail the bride? A feeble voice may give an earnest sound, And grateful hearts are measured not by power, Therefore may I, tho' nameless and uncrowned, Proffer a friendly tribute to thy dower. For on the midland Sea I sailed of old, Leading thy line of narrow rippled light, And saw it grow a field of frosted gold, With every boat a Shadow in the Bright; And many a playful fancy has been mine, As I have watched the shapes thy glory made, Glimpsing like starlight through the massive pine, Or finely-trellised by mimosa shade; And now I trace each moment of thy spell, That frees from mortal stain these Venice isles, From eve's rich shield to morn's translucid shell, From Love's young glow to Love's expiring smiles! We gaze upon the faces we hold dear, Each feature in thy rays as well defined, As just a symbol of informing mind, As when the moon is on them full and clear; Yet all some wise attempered and subdued, Not far from what to Faith's prospective eyes Transfigured creatures of beatitude From earthly graves arise. Those evenings, oh! those evenings, when with one, Then the world's loveliness, now wholly mine, I stood beside the salient founts that shone Fit frontispiece to Peter's Roman shrine; I knew how fair were She and They In every bright device of day, All happy as a lark on wing, A singing, glistening, dancing thing, With joy and grace that seemed to be Of Nature's pure necessity; But when, O holy Moon! thy might Turned all the water into light, And each enchanted Fountain wore Diviner beauty than before, A pillar of aspiring beams, An ever-falling veil of gleams,— She who in day's most lively hour Had something of composing power About her mirthful lips and eyes,— Sweet folly making others wise,— Was vested with a sudden sense Of great and grave intelligence, As if in thy reflex she saw The process of eternal law, God's conscious pleasure working out Through all the Passion, Pain, and Doubt;— And thus did She and Thou impart Such knowledge to my listening heart, Such sympathies as word or pen Can never tell again! All spirits find themselves fulfilled in Thee, The glad have triumph and the mourning balm: Dear God! how wondrous that a thing should be So very glorious and so very calm! The lover, standing on a lonely height, Rests his sad gaze upon the scene below, Lapt in the trance of thy pervading glow, Till pleasant tears obscure his pensive sight; And in his bosom those long-smothered flames, The scorching elements of vain desire, Taking the nature of thy gentle fire, Play round the heart in peace, while he exclaims, “Surely my Love is out somewhere to-night!” Why art thou thus companionable? Why Do we not love thy light alone, but Thee? Is it that though thou art so pure and high, Thou dost not shock our senses, as they be? That our poor eyes rest on thee, and descry Islands of earth within thy golden sea? Or should the root be sought In some unconscious thought, That thy fine presence is not more thine own Than are our soul's adorning splendours ours?— Than are the energies and powers, With which reflected light alone Illuminates the living hours, From our own wells of being brought, From virtue self-infused or seed of life self-sown? Thus with ascent more ready may we pass From this delightful sharing of thy gifts Up to the common Giver, Source, and Will; And if, alas! His daily-affluent sun-light seldom lifts To thankful ecstasy our hearts' dull mass, It may be that our feeble sight Will not confront the total light, That we may love, in nature frail, To blend the vivid with the pale, The dazzling with the dim: And lo! how God, all-gracious still Our simplest fancies to fulfil, Bids us, O Southern Moon, thy beauty hail, In Thee rejoicing and adoring Him. PICTURES IN VERSE. I. PICTURE BY GIOV. BELLINI, IN THE CHURCH OF THE REDENTORE AT VENICE. THE VIRGIN. Who am I, to be so far exalted Over all the maidens of Judæa, That here only in this lonely bosom Is the wonder-work of God revealèd? Oh! to think this little, little infant, Whose warm limbs upon my knees are resting, Helpless, silent, with his tender eyelids, Like two pearl-shells, delicately closèd, Is informed with that eternal spirit, Who, between the Cherubim enthronèd, Dwells behind the Curtain of the Temple! I can only gaze on him adoring, Fearful lest the simple joy and passion Which my mother-love awakes within me, Be not something bold and too familiar For this Child of Miracle and Glory. TWO ANGELS. (PLAYING ON INSTRUMENTS.) We and the little cheerful goldfinch, Perched above that blessèd seat,— He above and we below,— We with voices and sweet viols, He with chirping voice alone,— Glorify the happy Mother, Glorify the holy Child. Now that our great heavenly Master Has put on this wondrous semblance Of a humble mortal infant, We, the Angels of his presence, Are become as simple children, And beside him watch, admiring All his innocence and beauty, Lulling him to downy slumbers With remembrances of Heaven. THE CHILD JESUS. I seem to be asleep,—I seem to dream,— But it is Ye, Children of fallen Man, Who dream, not I. Though I am now come down, Out of the Waking of Eternal Truth, Here born into the miserable Dream Of your poor Life, still I must ever wake, For I am Love, and if ye follow me, Ye too will wake;—I come to lead the way. II. THE MARTYRDOM OF ST. CHRISTINA, BY VINCENZO CATENA, IN THE CHURCH OF SANTA MARIA MATER DOMINI, AT VENICE. ST. CHRISTINA. (KNEELING.) I knew, I knew, it would be so, That, in this long-expected hour, Thou would'st not leave me, Christ, my Lord! My poor blind-hearted enemies Have brought me here to die,—even here, In this my old delight, the Lake Of dear Bolsena; they have tied About my weak and slender neck A ponderous millstone, that my frame May be dragged down to surest death Within that undulating tomb. The stone is there,—the cord is there, But the gross weight I cannot feel, For round me, even while I pray, Beautiful-wingèd childly shapes Are gathering, smiling glorious smiles. With what deep looks of sympathy They dwell upon me! with what care Some raise the cord, some raise the stone, So that it cannot sway me down. O my soul's lover! Saviour Christ! take this earnest of thy grace, Assured that I shall lay aside The coil of this tormented flesh, Without a thought of fear or pain,— That, when this mortal shell is cast Into the stifling element, That instrument of my distress Will, at thy blessèd will, be changed Into the very air of Heaven. CHORUS OF ANGELS. Sister Christine, sweetest Sister, Know you not from whom we come? See, we kneel around you kneeling, Offering kind and loving duty, All we can to soothe your suffering, All we can to make you glad! Ah! we see you look with wonder, That our small and tender hands Can raise up this heavy stone, Without show of pain or labour: Do you believe then, That, because our long gold hair, And our rosy-rounded faces, And our laughing lips and eyes, And our baby-moulded limbs Are like those of earthly children, We have not the strength, the glory, and the power, Which our Father gives unto his dear ones,— Which he will give to you, most happy Christine, For you have loved him? CHRIST. (ABOVE, SPEAKING TO AN ANGEL.) Angel! to thee is given the noble charge To bear this martyr-mantle perfect-white To my dear daughter Christine there below; That she, when clothed thus worthily, may pass From the hard triumph of her prison-life To the embraces of essential Love. ANGEL. (KNEELING, AND HOLDING THE MANTLE.) Burning with delight, I haste This high mission to perform,— But it is an awful task, Even for an Angel's hands, Such a power of God to hold, As the sign of Martyrdom. III. JESUS AND JOHN CONTENDING FOR THE CROSS. BY SIMEONE DA PESARO; IN THE COLLECTION OF THE SEMINARY AT VENICE. THE CHILD JOHN. (TRYING TO TAKE THE CROSS OUT OF THE HAND OF JESUS Give me the Cross, I pray you, dearest Jesus! Oh! if you knew how much I wish to have it, You would not hold it in your hand so tightly: Something has told me,—something in my heart here, Which I am sure is true,—that if you keep it,— If you will let no other take it from you,— Terrible things, I cannot bear to think of, Must fall upon you; show me that you love me: Am I not here to be your little servant, Follow your steps and wait upon your wishes? Why may I not take up the heavy plaything, And on my shoulder carry it behind you? Then, I am older, stronger too, than you are; I am a child o' the desert and the mountains;— Deep i' the waste, I shouted at the wild bees,— They flew away, and left me all the honey: Look at the shaggy skin I've tied about me; Surely, if Pain or any other evil Somewhere about this mystery be hidden, I am the fittest of the two to suffer! THE CHILD JESUS. (HOLDING THE CROSS FIRMLY.) Ask me not, my gentle brother,—ask no more, it must not be: In the heart of this poor trifle lies the secret unrevealed Which has brought me to this world, and sent you to prepare my way. In the long and weary woodland, where your path of life will lead, Thousand, myriad, other Crosses you will find on every side; And the same eternal Law that bids me take this chiefest one, Will be there to give you many, grievous as your strength can bear; But in vain would you and others sink beneath the holy load, Were I not with mine before you, Captain of the Crucified; I must be your elder Brother in the heritage of Pain; I must give you to our Father,—I must fall for you to rise. THE VIRGIN. (WITH HER HAND ON THE CROSS.) My soul is weak with doubt,— What can I think or do? To which of these dear children shall I yield The object of their earnest looks and words? Ah me! I see within That artless wooden form, A meaning of exceeding misery, A dark, dark shadow of oncoming woe. Oh! give it up, my child! I see your bright eyes close, Your soft fair fingers spattered all with blood, Your cheeks dead pale;—throw down the horrid toy. He grasps it firmer still! I dare not thwart his hand; For what he does, he does not of himself, But in the Will of Him who sent him here. And I, who labour blind In this abysmal work, Must bear the weight of dumb expectancy, Of women first in honour and in woe! IV. CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO PURGATORY. BY GIORGIONE, AT VENICE. The saving work for man is finishèd, The kingdoms of the Earth and Air o'erthrown; So now hath Christ come down among the dead, Spoiling the Spoiler, to redeem his own. What blessèd glory plays about that head For those who here in fiery bondage groan, Conscious their suffering never could atone For Sin, till He that once had sufferèd. And, lo! in patient melancholy state The synod of the Patriarchs rests apart Condemned, tho' sons of God by faith, to wait In this dark place and solitude of heart, Joyless and tearless, till this Christ should come To bear them to their Father and their Home. SIR WALTER SCOTT AT THE TOMB OF THE STUARTS IN ST. PETER'S. When Sir Walter Scott was at Rome, the year of his death, the history and localities of the Stuarts seemed to absorb all other objects of his interest. The circumstance of this poem fell within the observation of the writer. Eve's tinted shadows slowly fill the fane Where Art has taken almost Nature's room, While still two objects clear in light remain, An alien pilgrim at an alien tomb.— —A sculptured tomb of regal heads discrown'd, Of one heart-worshipped, fancy-haunted, name, Once loud on earth, but now scarce else renown'd Than as the offspring of that stranger's fame. There lie the Stuarts!—There lingers Walter Scott! Strange congress of illustrious thoughts and things! A plain old moral, still too oft forgot,— The power of Genius and the fall of Kings. The curse on lawless Will high-planted there, A beacon to the world, shines not for him; He is with those who felt their life was sere, When the full light of loyalty grew dim. He rests his chin upon a sturdy staff, Historic as that sceptre, theirs no more; His gaze is fixed; his thirsty heart can quaff, For a short hour, the spirit-draughts of yore. Each figure in its pictured place is seen, Each fancied shape his actual vision fills, From the long-pining, death-delivered, Queen, To the worn Outlaw of the heathery hills. O grace of life, which shame could never mar! O dignity, that circumstance defied! Pure is the neck that wears the deathly scar, And sorrow has baptised the front of pride. But purpled mantle, and blood-crimson'd shroud, Exiles to suffer and returns to woo, Are gone, like dreams by daylight disallow'd; And their historian,—he is sinking too! A few more moments and that labouring brow Cold as those royal busts and calm will lie; And, as on them his thoughts are resting now, His marbled form will meet the attentive eye. Thus, face to face, the dying and the dead, Bound in one solemn ever-living bond, Communed; and I was sad that ancient head Ever should pass those holy walls beyond. THE ILLUMINATIONS OF ST. PETER'S. I. FIRST ILLUMINATION. Translated by C. J. M`C.— Tempio! che'l ciel con quest' angusto mondo E 'l tempo coll' eternità mariti, Di quai bellezze nuove il viso inondo Or che mite e fral tu lo sguardo inviti! Sorridòn sciolti sotto vel profondo Quei tratti già da fermo sasso uniti, Tela di luce sol ti fa giocondo,— Sol di gemme, di fiamma, e' son vestiti. Eppur che gioia nel pensier segreto Che quando l' avide Ore e l' invidioso Sol spegneran quel fregio, or si pomposo, Tu non perciò vedrai a te rovina, Ma sempre stai eterno e chiaro e lieto, Or divin sogno, or realtà divina! Temple! where Time has wed Eternity, How beautiful Thou art, beyond compare, Now emptied of thy massive majesty, And made so faery-frail, so faery-fair: The lineaments that thou art wont to wear Augustly traced in ponderous masonry, Lie faint as in a woof of filmy air, Within their frames of mellow jewelry.— But yet how sweet the hardly-waking sense, That when the strength of hours has quenched those gems, Disparted all those soft-bright diadems,— Still in the Sun thy form will rise supreme In its own solid clear magnificence, Divinest substance then, as now divinest dream. II. SECOND ILLUMINATION. My heart was resting with a peaceful gaze, So peaceful that it seemed I well could die Entranced before such Beauty,—when a cry Burst from me, and I sunk in dumb amaze: The molten stars before a withering blaze Paled to annihilation, and my eye, Stunned by the splendour, saw against the sky Nothing but light,—sheer light,—and light's own haze. At last that giddying Sight took form,—and then Appeared the stable Vision of a Crown, From the black vault by unseen Power let down, Cross-topped,—thrice girt with flame:—Cities of men, Queens of the Earth! bow low,—was ever brow Of mortal birth adorned as Rome is now? III. REFLECTION. Past is the first dear phantom of our sight, A loadstar of calm loveliness to draw All souls from out this world of fault and flaw, To a most perfect centre of delight, Merged in deep fire;—our joy is turned to awe, Delight to wonder. This is just and right;— A greater light puts out the lesser light,— So be it ever,—such is God's high law. The self-same Sun that calls the flowers from earth Withers them soon, to give the fruit free birth;— The nobler Spirit to whom much is given Must take still more, though in that more there lie The risk of losing All;—to gaze at Heaven, We blind our earthly eyes;—to live we die. THE FIREWORKS. FROM THE CASTLE OF ST. ANGELO. Play on, play on, I share your gorgeous glee, Creatures of elemental mirth! play on,— Let each fulfil his marvellous destiny, My heart leaps up and falls in unison. The Tower round which ye weave, with elfin grace, The modulations of your burning dance, Looks through your gambols with a grandsire's face, A grave but not reproachful countenance; Ye are the children of a festive night, He is the mate of many an hundred years,— Ye but attest men's innocent delight, He is the comrade of their crimes and tears,— Ye in your joy's pure prime will flare away, He waits his end in still and slow decay. ON THE MARRIAGE OF THE LADY GWENDOLIN TALBOT WITH THE ELDEST SON OF THE PRINCE BORGHESE. Lady! to decorate thy marriage morn, Rare gems, and flowers, and lofty songs are brought; Thou the plain utterance of a Poet's thought, Thyself at heart a Poet, wilt not scorn: The name, into whose splendour thou wert born, Thou art about to change for that which stands Writ on the proudest work St. Peter's. that mortal hands Have raised from earth, Religion to adorn. Take it rejoicing,—take with thee thy dower, Britain's best blood, and Beauty ever new, Being of mind; may the cool northern dew Still rest upon thy leaves, transplanted flower! Mingling thy English nature, pure and true, With the bright growth of each Italian hour. Rome, May 11th, 1835. ON THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS BORGHESE, AT ROME, NOVEMBER, 1840. Once, and but once again I dare to raise A voice which thou in spirit still may'st hear, Now that thy bridal bed becomes a bier, Now that thou canst not blush at thine own praise! The ways of God are not as our best ways, And thus we ask, with a convulsive tear, Why is this northern blossom low and sere? Why has it blest the south but these few days? Another Basilic, S. Maria Maggiore, where the Borghese family are interred. decked otherwise Than that which hailed thee as a princely bride, Receives thee and three little ones beside; While the young lord of that late glorious home Stands 'mid these ruins and these agonies, Like some lone column of his native Rome! ROMAN RUINS. How could Rome live so long, and now be dead? How came this waste and wilderness of stones? How shows the orbèd monster, so long fed On martyr-blood, his bare and crumbling bones? Did the strong Faith, that built eight hundred years Of world-dominion on a robber's name, Once animate this corse, and fervent seers Augur it endless life and shadeless fame? Stranger! if thou a docile heart dost bring Within thee, bear a timely precept hence; That Power, mere Power, is but a barren thing, Even when it seems most like omnipotence; The forms must pass,—and past, they leave behind Little to please, and nought to bless mankind. ON A SCENE IN TUSCANY. What good were it to dim the pleasure-glow, That lights thy cheek, fair Girl, in scenes like these, By shameful facts, and piteous histories? While we enjoy, what matters what we know? What tender love-sick looks on us below Those Mountains cast! how courteously the Trees Raise up their branching heads in calices For the thick Vine to fill and overflow! This nature is like Thee, all-bright, all-mild; If then some self-wise man should say, that here Hate, sin, and death held rule for many a year, That of this kindliest earth there's not a rood But has been saturate with brother's blood,— Believe him not, believe him not, my Child. AN INCIDENT AT PISA. “From the common burial-ground Mark'd by some peculiar bound, Beppo! who are these that lie Like one numerous family?” “They whose bodies rest within This appointed place, Signor! never knew of sin, Only knew of grace. Purified from earthly leaven, They have mounted straight to heaven, Without sorrow, without thrall, Blessed children, angels all!” “But that second space, with art Fenc'd from all the rest apart, Though from those sweet infants' bed By a low wall separated— Beppo! who are these, and why To the others laid so nigh?” “Signor! they who moulder here, Be it wrong or right, Shake with many a pang of fear Passers-by at night: Men of passion, vice, and pride, Who in evil liv'd and died, Unrepentant, unconfess'd, By the sacraments unbless'd; Though with these are mingled some That deserv'd a better doom, When by sudden death waylaid, Ere their peace with God was made: But why they who guiltless die By those reprobates should lie, Signor! the priest may know, not I.” In these words the truth discerning, Much I ponder'd, home returning, Whether chance or wise design Drew this thin dividing line, Almost blending in this close Old decay and young repose; Almost laying side by side Those who hardly liv'd and died, And the wretched ones for whom Life has been a very tomb. Oh! if in our utmost need Love has power to intercede— If between us and our foes Innocence may interpose— May not they, who dare not claim Pardon in the church's name, By some sweet and secret law From these little neighbours draw Blessings such as nature gave To the angel-ruffled wave; Finding a Bethesda's worth In this angel-planted earth? NAPLES AND VENICE. Overlooking, overhearing, Naples and her subject bay, Stands Camaldoli, the convent, shaded from the inclement ray. Thou, who to that lofty terrace, lov'st on summer-eve to go, Tell me, Poet! what Thou seest,—what Thou hearest, there below! Beauty, beauty, perfect beauty! Sea and City, Hills and Air, Rather blest imaginations than realities of fair. Forms of grace alike contenting casual glance and stedfast gaze, Tender lights of pearl and opal mingling with the diamond blaze. Sea is but as deepen'd æther: white as snow-wreaths sunbeshone Lean the Palaces and Temples green and purple heights upon. Streets and paths mine eye is tracing, all replete with clamorous throng, Where I see and where I see not, waves of uproar roll along. As the sense of bees unnumber'd, burning through the walk of limes,— As the thought of armies gathering round a chief in ancient times,— So from Corso, Port, and Garden, rises Life's tumultuous strain, Not secure from wildest utterance rests the perfect-crystal main. Still the all-enclosing Beauty keeps my spirit free from harm, Distance blends the veriest discords into some melodious charm. —Overlooking, overhearing, Venice and her sister isles, Stands the giant Campanile massive 'mid a thousand piles. Thou who to this open summit lov'st at every hour to go, Tell me, Poet! what Thou seest, what Thou hearest, there below. Wonder, wonder, perfect wonder! Ocean is the City's moat; On the bosom of broad Ocean seems the mighty weight to float: Seems—yet stands as strong and stable as on land e'er city shall,— Only moves that Ocean-serpent, tide-impelled the Great Canal. Rich arcades and statued pillars, gleaming banners, burnished domes,— Ships approaching,—ships departing,—countless ships in harbour-homes. Yet so silent! scarce a murmur winged to reach this airy seat, Hardly from the close Piazza rises sound of voice or feet. Plash of oar or single laughter,—cry or song of Gondolier,— Signals far between to tell me that the work of life is here. Like a glorious maiden dreaming music in the drowsy heat, Lies the City, unbetokening where its myriad pulses beat. And I think myself in cloudland,—almost try my power of will, Whether I can change the picture, or it must be Venice still. When the question wakes within me, which hath won the crown of deed, Venice with her moveless silence, Naples with her noisy speed? Which hath writ the goodlier tablet for the past to hoard and show, Venice in her student stillness, Naples in her living glow? Here are Chronicles with virtues studded as the night with stars,— Records there of passions raging through a wilderness of wars: There a tumult of Ambitions, Power afloat on blood and tears,— Here one simple reign of Wisdom stretching thirteen hundred years: Self-subsisting, self-devoted, there the moment's Hero ruled,— Here the State, each one subduing, pride enchained and passion schooled: Here was Art the nation's mistress, Art of colour, Art of stone— There before the leman Pleasure bowed the people's soul alone. Venice! vocal is thy silence, can our soul but rightly hear; Naples! dumb as death thy voices, listen we however near. CANNÆ. Save where Garganus, with low-ridgèd bound, Protects the North, the eye outstretching far Surveys one sea of gently-swelling ground, A fitly-moulded “Orchestra of War.” Here Aufidus, between his humble banks With wild thyme plotted, winds along the plain, A devious path, as when the serried ranks Passed over it, that passed not back again. The long-horned herds enjoy the cool delight, Sleeping half-merged, to shun the deep sun-glow, Which, that May-morning, The battle was fought on the 21st of May, B.C. 216. dazed the Roman sight, But fell innocuous on the subtler foe. We feel the wind upon our bosoms beat, That whilom dimmed with dust those noble eyes, Vulturnus, a south-east wind, probably a local name. And rendered aimless many a gallant feat, And brought disgrace on many a high emprise. And close beside us rests the ancient well, The only localities preserved in the tradition are this large fountain, which goes by the name of the “Consul's Well,” and “The Place of Blood,” a farm-house on the other side of the river, where they say the Roman prisoners were massacred. Where at the end of that accursed day, Apulian peasants to their grandsons tell, The friend and follower of wise Fabius lay; Here fainting lay, compelled by fate to share Shame not his own,—here spurned the scanty time Still left for flight, lest, living, he might bear Hard witness to his colleague's generous crime. Abi, nuncia publice patribus urbem Romam muniant . . . . privatimque Fabio, L. Æmilium præceptorum ejus memorem extitisse, et vixisse, et adhuc mori; et tu me, in hac strage militum meorum, patere exspirare, ne ut reus inteream, causâque consulatus accusator collegæ existam, ut alieno rimine innocentiam meam protegam. Liv. xxii. I have seen many fields where men have fought With mightier issues, but not one, I deem, Where history offers to reflecting thought, So sharp a check of greatness so supreme. ON LEAVING ITALY, FOR THE SUMMER, ON ACCOUNT OF HEALTH. Thou summer-land! that dost put on the sun Not as a dress of pomp occasional, But as thy natural and most fitting one,— Yet still thy Beauty has its festival, Its own chief day, And I, though conscious of the bliss begun, Must turn away! I leave thee in thy royalest attire Of affluent life,—I leave thee 'mid thy wealth Of sunlight gold and jewels of all fire,— Led by the paltry care of weakened health And fear of pain; Who knows that I shall see, ere I expire, Thy face again! I almost could persuade me that too dear My Northern-island birthdom has been bought, The vantage-ground of intellect, the clear And bright expanse of action and of thought, If I am bound To limit all the good my heart has sought To that cold ground. What is my gain that I can take and mesh The Beautiful in Nature's deepest sea, If I am bound the bondman of the flesh, And must not float upon the surface free? Why should these powers Bring nothing but a burden ever fresh Of yearning hours? Why do we wish the things we do not dare? Why do I tremble at my æstuous Soul That would embrace the burning god, and there Give up into the elemental whole Its worthless frame, Whose instincts guide me captive everywhere, In grief and shame? Oh! what a world of strifes of good and ill Is this that we are cast in? Head and Heart, Body and Spirit, Faculties and Will, Nothing at peace, all sundered and apart; Who would not shun This war, if Death were sure to make him still, Or make him One! SWITZERLAND AND ITALY. Within the Switzer's varied land, When Summer chases high the snow, You'll meet with many a youthful band Of strangers wandering to and fro: Through hamlet, town, and healing bath, They haste and rest as chance may call, No day without its mountain-path, No path without its waterfall. They make the hours themselves repay, However well or ill be shared, Content that they should wing their way, Unchecked, unreckoned, uncompared: For though the hills unshapely rise, And lie the colours poorly bright,— They mould them by their cheerful eyes, And paint them with their spirit's light. Strong in their youthfulness, they use The energies their souls possess; And if some wayward scene refuse To pay its part of loveliness,— Onward they pass, nor less enjoy For what they leave;—and far from me Be every thought that would destroy A charm of that simplicity! But if one blot on that white page From Doubt or Misery's pen be thrown,— If once the sense awake, that Age Is counted not by years alone,— Then no more grand and wonderous things! No active happinesses more! The wounded Heart has lost its wings, And change can only fret the sore. Yet there is calm for those that weep, Where the divine Italian sea Rests like a maiden hushed asleep And breathing low and measuredly; Where all the sunset-purpled ground, Fashioned by those delicious airs, Seems strewed with softest cushions round For weary heads to loose their cares: Where Nature offers, at all hours, Out of her free imperial store, That perfect Beauty their weak powers Can help her to create no more: And grateful for that ancient aid, Comes forth to comfort and relieve Those minds in prostrate sorrow laid, Bidding them open and receive! Though still 'tis hardly she that gives, For Nature reigns not there alone, A mightier queen beside her lives, Whom she can serve but not dethrone; For she is fallen from the state That waited on her Eden-prime, And Art remains by Sin and Fate Unscathed, for Art is not of Time. PALM LEAVES. THE GREEK AT CONSTANTINOPLE. The cypresses of Scutari In stern magnificence look down On the bright lake and stream of sea, And glittering theatre of town: Above the throng of rich kiosks, Above the towers in triple tire, Above the domes of loftiest mosques, These pinnacles of death aspire. It is a wilderness of tombs,— Where white and gold and brilliant hue Contrast with Nature's gravest glooms, As these again with heaven's clear blue: The city's multitudinous hum, So far, yet strikes the listening ear,— But what are thousands to the sum Of millions calmly sleeping here? For here, whate'er his life's degree, The Muslim loves to rest at last, Loves to recross the band of sea That parts him from his people's past. 'Tis well to live and lord o'er those By whom his sires were most renowned, But his fierce heart finds best repose In this traditionary ground. From this funereal forest's edge I gave my sight full range below, Reclining on a grassy ledge, Itself a grave, or seeming so: And that huge city flaunting bright, That crowded port and busy shore, With roofs and minarets steeped in light, Seemed but a gaudy tomb the more. I thought of what one might have hoped From Greek and Roman power combined, From strength, that with a world had coped, Matched to the queen of human mind;— From all the wisdom, might, and grace, That Fancy's gods to man had given, Blent in one empire and one race, By the true faith in Christ and Heaven. The finest webs of earthly fate Are soonest and most harshly torn; The wise could scarce discriminate That evening splendour from the morn; Though we, sad students of the past, Can trace the lurid twilight line That lies between the first and last, Who bore the name of Constantine. Such were my thoughts and such the scene, When I perceived that by me stood A Grecian youth of earnest mien, Well-suiting my reflective mood: And when he spoke, his words were tuned Harmonious to my present mind, As if his spirit had communed With mine, while I had there reclined. “Stranger! whose soul has strength to soar Beyond the compass of the eye, And on a spot like this can more Than charms of form and hue descry,— Take off this mask of beauty,—scan The face of things with truth severe, Think, as becomes a Christian man, Of us thy Christian brethren here! “Think of that age's awful birth, When Europe echoed, terror-riven, That a new foot was on the earth, And a new name came down from Heaven: When over Calpe's straits and steeps The Moor had bridged his royal road, And Othman's sons from Asia's deeps The conquests of the Cross o'erflowed. “Think, if the arm of Charles Martel Had failed upon the plain of Tours, The fate, whose course you know so well, This foul subjection had been yours: Where then had been the long renown France can from sire to son deliver? Where English freedom rolling down, One widening, one continuous, river? “Think with what passionate delight The tale was told in Christian halls, How Sobieski turned to flight The Muslim from Vienna's walls: How, when his horse triumphant trod The burgher's richest robes upon, The ancient words rose loud—‘From God A man was sent whose name was John.’ Historical. “Think not that time can ever give Prescription to such doom as ours, That Grecian hearts can ever live Contented serfs of barbarous powers: More than six hundred years had past, Since Moorish hosts could Spain o'erwhelm, Yet Boabdil was thrust at last, Lamenting, from Grenada's realm. “And if to his old Asian seat, From this usurped unnatural throne, The Turk is driven, 'tis surely meet That we again should hold our own: Be but Byzantium's native sign Of Cross on Crescent The Turks adopted the sign of the Crescent from Byzantium after the conquest: the Cross above the Crescent is found on many ruins of the Grecian city; among others, on the Genoese castle on the Bosphorus. The Virgin standing on the Crescent is another common sign. once unfurled, And Greece shall guard by right divine The portals of the Eastern world. “Before the small Athenian band The Persian myriads stood at bay, The spacious East lay down unmanned Beneath the Macedonian's sway: Alas! that Greek could turn on Greek— Fountain of all our woes and shame— Till men knew scarcely where to seek The fragments of the Grecian name. “Know ye the Romans of the North: The fearful race whose infant strength Stretches its arms of conquest forth, To grasp the world in breadth and length? They cry ‘That ye and we are old, And worn with luxuries and cares, And they alone are fresh and bold, Time's latest and most honoured heirs! “Alas for you! alas for us! Alas for men that think and feel, If once beside this Bosphorus Shall stamp Sclavonia's frozen heel! Oh! place us boldly in the van, And ere we yield this narrow sea, The past shall hold within its span At least one more Thermopylæ.” THE TURK AT CONSTANTINOPLE TO THE FRANK. When first the Prophet's standard rested on The land that once was Greece and still was Rome; We deemed that his and our dominion Was there as sure as in our Eastern home: We never thought a single hour to pause Till the wide West had owned Mohammed's laws. How could we doubt it? To one desert tribe The truth revealed by one plain-seeming man Cut off the cavil, thundered down the gibe, And formed a nation to its lofty plan: What barrier could its wave of victory stem? Not thy religious walls, Jerusalem! The impious wars that stained the faithful host, Might for some years the ripe success delay; But when we once stood firm on Europe's coast, 'Twas as the dawning of that final day, That could not close till Islam's flag was furled O'er the last ruins of the Roman world. For History is not silent what we did, Long ere we crushed to dust the Grecian name: It was no Western to whom Bajazid Surrendered his long heritage of fame; The shame of Hungary was not less sure, Because your victor crouched before Timour. Hard was the penalty of broken faith, By Lladislaus paid on Varna's plain: A.D. 1444. A copy of the treaty, the monument of Christian perfidy had been displayed in the front of battle; and it is said that the Sultan, in his distress, lifting his eyes and his hands to heaven, implored the protection of the God of Truth, and called on the prophet Jesus himself, to avenge the impious mockery of his name and religion.—Gibbon, chap. lxvii. For many a Knight there met unhonoured death, When, like a god of vengeance, rose again Old Amurath from his far home and cried, “Now Jesus combats on Mohammed's side!” Nor was the mission of our Master stayed, When seated safe on this imperial throne; Witness the wonders wrought before Belgrade, A.D.1456, when defended by John Huniàdes. The fields whose very loss none blushed to own; Witness St. John's proud island-chevaliers, Knights of Rhodes. Thrust from their lordship of two hundred years. Thus did we justify the Faith by Works: And the bright Crescent haunted Europe's eye, Till many a Pope believed the demon Turks Would scour the Vatican, ere he could die: Why was our arm of conquest shortened? Why? Ask him whose will is o'er us, like the sky. The dome to heavenly wisdom Hagaia Sophia. consecrate Still echoes with the Muslim's fervent prayers; The just successor of the Khaleefate Still on his brow the sign of empire wears; We hold our wealth without reserve or fear; And yet we know we are but tented here. Millions of Christians bend beneath our rule, And yet these realms are neither theirs nor ours, Sultan and subject are alike the tool Of Europe's ready guile or banded powers; Against the lords of continent and sea What can one nation do, one people be? Therefore regardless of the moment's shame, Of wives' disdain, and children's thoughtless woe, Of Christian triumph o'er the Prophet's name, Of Russia's smile beneath her mask of snow: Let us return to Asia's fair domain, Let us in truth possess the East again! Men of the West! Ye understand us not, We you no more: ye take our good for ill; Ye scorn what we esteem man's happiest lot— Perfect submission to creative will; Ye would rejoice to watch from us depart Our ancient temperance—our peace of heart. Let us return! if long we linger here Ye will destroy us, not with open swords, Not with such arms as brave men must not fear, But with the poison'd shafts of subtle words: Your blank indifference for our living creed Would make us paltry Infidels indeed. What can Ye give us for a Faith so lost? For love of Duty, and delight in Prayer? How are we wiser that our minds are tost By winds of knowledge on a sea of care? How are we better that we hardly fear To break the laws our fathers held most dear? Aping your customs we have changed e'en now The noble garb in nature's wisdom given, And turban that, on every Muslim's brow, Was as a crown at once for earth and heaven:— The sword with which the sire Byzantium won Sleeps in yon deep unwielded by the son. The sword of Mohammed the Second, worn at the conquest of Constantinople, had always been religiously preserved in a mosque untainted by the foot of the Infidel. The late Sultan put it on, the day he went to visit the large man-of-war which bears his name, when first completed: on mounting the ship's side, the sword, which was a small short one, got detached, and fell into the strait, lost irrecoverably;—this was regarded at the time as a most unhappy omen. Let us return! across the fatal strait Our Father's shadows welcome us once more; Back to the glories of the Khaleefate, Back to the faith we loved, the dress we wore, When in one age the world could well contain Haroòn Er-Rasheed and your Charlemagne! THE HAREEM. In the general confusion of the orthography of Eastern words, I have usually adopted Mr. Lane's. Behind the veil, where depth is traced By many a complicated line,— Behind the lattice closely laced With filagree of choice design,— Behind the lofty garden-wall, Where stranger face can ne'er surprise,— That inner world her all-in-all, The Eastern Woman lives and dies. Husband and children round her draw The narrow circle where she rests; His will the single perfect law, That scarce with choice her mind molests; Their birth and tutelage the ground And meaning of her life on earth— She knows not elsewhere could be found The measure of a woman's worth. If young and beautiful, she dwells An Idol in a secret shrine, Where one high-priest alone dispels The solitude of charms divine: And in his happiness she lives, And in his honour has her own, And dreams not that the love she gives Can be too much for him alone. Within the gay kiosk reclined, Above the scent of lemon groves, Where bubbling fountains kiss the wind, And birds make music to their loves,— She lives a kind of faëry life, In sisterhood of fruits and flowers, Unconscious of the outer strife, That wears the palpitating hours. And when maturer duties rise In pleasure's and in passion's place, Her duteous loyalty supplies The presence of departed grace: So hopes she, by untiring truth, To win the bliss to share with him, Those glories of celestial youth, That time can never taint or dim. It is supposed to be left to the will of the husband to decide whether his wife should be united to him in a future state: but this does not imply that her happiness after death depends upon him. Thus in the ever-closed Hareem, As in the open Western home, Sheds womanhood her starry gleam Over our being's busy foam; Through latitudes of varying faith Thus trace we still her mission sure, To lighten life, to sweeten death, And all for others to endure. Home of the East! thy threshold's edge Checks the wild foot that knows no fear, Yet shrinks, as if from sacrilege— When rapine comes thy precincts near: Existence, whose precarious thread Hangs on the tyrant's mood and nod, Beneath thy roof its anxious head Rests as within the house of God. There, though without he feels a slave, Compelled another's will to scan, Another's favour forced to crave There is the subject still the man: There is the form that none but he Can touch,—the face that he alone Of living men has right to see;— Not He who fills the Prophet's throne. Then let the Moralist, who best Honours the female heart, that blends The deep affections of the West With thought of life's sublimest ends, Ne'er to the Eastern home deny Its lesser, yet not humble praise, To guard one pure humanity Amid the stains of evil days. THE MOSQUE. A simple unpartitioned room,— Surmounted by an ample dome, Or, in some lands that favoured lie, With centre open to the sky, But roofed with archèd cloisters round, That mark the consecrated bound, And shade the niche to Mekkeh turned, By which two massive lights are burned; With pulpit whence the sacred word Expounded on great days is heard; With fountain fresh, where, ere they pray, Men wash the soil of earth away; With shining minaret, thin and high, From whose fine-trelliced balcony Announcement of the hours of prayer Is uttered to the silent air; Such is the Mosque—the holy place, Where faithful men of every race, Meet at their ease, and face to face. Not that the power of God is here More manifest, or more to fear; Not that the glory of his face Is circumscribed by any space; But that, as men are wont to meet In court or chamber, mart or street, For purposes of gain or pleasure, For friendliness or social leisure,— So, for the greatest of all ends To which intelligence extends, The worship of the Lord, whose will Created and sustains us still, And honour of the Prophet's name, By whom the saving message came, Believers meet together here, And hold these precincts very dear. The floor is spread with matting neat, Unstained by touch of shodden feet— A decent and delightful seat! Where, after due devotions paid, And legal ordinance obeyed, Men may in happy parlance join, And gay with serious thought combine; May ask the news from lands away, May fix the business of to-day; Or, with “God-willing,” at the close, To-morrow's hopes and deeds dispose. Children are running in and out With silver-sounding laugh and shout, No more disturbed in their sweet play, No more disturbing those that pray, Than the poor birds, that fluttering fly Among the rafters there on high, Or seek at times, with grateful hop, The corn fresh-sprinkled on the top. So lest the stranger's scornful eye Should hurt this sacred family,— Lest inconsiderate words should wound Devout adorers with their sound,— Lest careless feet should stain the floor With dirt and dust from out the door,— 'Tis well that custom should protect The place with prudence circumspect, And let no unbeliever pass The threshold of the faithful mass; That as each Muslim his Hareem Guards even from a jealous dream, So should no alien feeling scathe This common home of public faith, So should its very name dispel The presence of the infidel. Many of the mosques possess funds dedicated to the support of birds and other animals: one at Cairo has a large boat at the top filled with corn as fast as it is consumed, and another possessed an estate bequesthed to it to give food to the homeless cats of the city. Most of these funds have, however, now passed, with those of higher charities, into Mehemet Ali's own pocket. Yet, though such reverence may demand A building raised by human hand, Most honour to the men of prayer, Whose mosque is in them everywhere! Who, amid revel's wildest din, In war's severest discipline, On rolling deck, in thronged bazaar, In stranger lands, however far, However different in their reach Of thought, in manners, dress, or speech,— Will quietly their carpet spread, To Mekkeh turn the humble head, And, as if blind to all around, And deaf to each distracting sound, In ritual language God adore, In spirit to his presence soar, And, in the pauses of the prayer, Rest, as if rapt in glory there! MOHAMMEDANISM. While the high truths to man in Christ revealed Were met by early foes, Who oft assault by strategy concealed, And oft in force arose; While Pagan fancy would not lay aside Her pleasurable faith, At call of one who lived in that he died, And preached that Life was Death; And while philosophy with old belief Blent fragments of the new, Though every master held himself the chief Discerner of the true; In that convulsion and distress of thought, Th' Idea that long ago Had ruled the Hebrew mind occasion caught To strike a final blow. In the fresh passions of a vigorous race Was sown a living seed, Strong these contending mysteries to displace By one plain ancient creed. Thus in a life and land, such as of old The Patriarch name begot, Rose a new Prophet, simple to behold, Cast in a humble lot; Who in the wild requirements of his state Let half his life go by, And then stood up a man of faith and fate, That could the world defy. God and his Prophets, and the final day, He preached, and little more, Resting the weight of all he had to say On what was said before. Mohammed always professes to be renewing old truths, not to be revealing new ones: he seems to be always wishing to restore the patriarchal state of thought and feeling, with the addition of a distinct faith in a future life and in a day of final retribution. He bade men mark the fissureless blue sky, The streams that spring and run, The clouds that with regenerate life supply The havoc of the sun: All forms of life profuse and different, The camel and the palm, To them for sustenance or service sent, And wondrous herbs of balm; He bade them mark how all existence comes From one Creative will, As well the bee that 'mid the blossoms hums, As human pride and skill. How shadows of all beings, morn and even, Before Him humbly bend, And, willing or unwilling, earth and heaven Work out His solemn end. Therefore is God the Universal Power, The Absolute, the One,— With whom a thousand years are as an hour, And earth as moon or sun. And shall this God who all creation fills His creature men permit The puny fragments of their mortal wills Against his might to set? What wonderful insanity of pride! With objects of the eye And fanciful devices to divide His awful monarchy. Can vain associates The frequent recurrence of this notion evidently applies to the doctrine of the Trinity and the worship of the Virgin as much as to that of Idols; it is singular that Mohammed considers the two as equally common to all Christians; it has been suggested that the sect of Collyridians, who used to sacrifice cakes (KOLLURI/DES) to St Mary, had come prominently under his notice: this is unlikely and unnecessary; the mere title of the Mother of God was enough to excite his hostility, as that of the Son did; and his was not the mind to make the philosophical distinction. seated on His throne, Command the only Lord? What strength have they but flows from Him alone, Adorers or adored? Hew down the Idols: prayer is due to Power,— But these are weak and frail: —By men and angels every living hour Father, Creator, hail! So preached of God Mohammed, of himself He spoke in lowly words, As one who wanted not or power or pelf, Or more than God affords; I ask for no payment; I am paid at the hand of God—the Master of the universe. Kuràn, chap. xxvi. ver. 109. As a poor bearer with the message sent Of God's majestic will, In his whole being resolutely bent That mission to fulfil. The miracles to which he oft appealed Were Nature's, not his own, Teaching that God was everywhere revealed— Not in His words alone. No Poet he, weaving capricious dreams, To please inconstant youth, But one who uttered, without shows and seems, The serious facts of truth; And threats and promises, that line by line Were parts to mortals given Of that eternal Book of thought divine— The Prototype in heaven: Which ever and anon from that sad dawn Of sin that Adam saw In Pentateuch, and Gospel, and Kuràn Enunciates Allah's law. The archetye or “mother” of all these sacred books, is supposed to have existed in Heaven from the beginning of things: thus the Prophet always speaks of the Kuràn as a thing completed from the very beginning: thus, too, every verse is as much the Kuràn as the whole book. This adoration of the Word has had a peculiar effect on the Arabic language,—every word in the Kuràn being declared, as a matter of faith, to be pure Arabic, even those demonstrably Persian. The copies of the Kuràn printed by order of Mahomet Ali have not yet been sanctioned by the ecclesiastical authorities: they say, “they cannot answer for the errors of the press, some of them probably intentional, Infidels being occasionally employed in the work. The copyists, it must be remembered, are a strong interest in the East. In Noah, Abraham, Moses, Earth beholds The prophet lineage run, Down till the fulness of due time unfolds Immaculate Mary's son. Mohammed seems to have attached so little importance to miraculous events—regarding the whole world as one incessant miracle—that his recognition of the supernatural birth of Christ does not imply any acknowledgment of his divine nature. It still remains a subject of inquiry, from what sources he derived his notions of the theory of Christianity, or the person of its author. Not, probably, from books: for if his assertion (chap. xxix. v. 47) that he could neither read nor write had not been correct, it could have been disproved by many persons present, who had known him from his youth; and Toland's theory of his instruction by the apocryphal gospel of Barnabas has been put an end to by the discovery of the forgery of that work, written with the very intent of exciting this notion, long after Mohammed's era, in Italy or Spain. The Syrian monk, Sergius, is a rather obscure personage: Mohammed only knew him in his early days, and he is hardly likely to have filled the mind of a heathen boy with strange legends and perverted facts. The Christianity of the Kuràn is, in all probability, the Arabian tradition of that time, formed out of the recollections of the doctrine which spread very early into Arabia, but did not meet with much success there, and the relations of the Nestorian fugitives, who would not scruple to attribute many corruptions to the orthodox body. The Infancy, and other apocryphal gospels, are derived from a similar source, and hence their frequent coincidence with Mohammedan notions. Whence to Arabia's free unlettered child The great commission past,— Mohammed, the Apostle of the Wild, The purest and the last. Thus stood he wholly in reflected light, Rejecting other claim To power or honour than attends of right The Apostolic name. Yet louder still he preached the day that comes Unhastened, undelayed, Fixed to consign to their eternal homes All men that God has made: The day when children shall grow gray with fear, And, like a ball of sand, God shall take up this our terrestrial sphere, In the hollow of his hand; When without intercessor, friend, or kin, Each man shall stand alone, “All shall appear before him on the day of resurrection, each alone. Chap. xix. v. 95. Before his judge, and, once for ever, win A prison or a throne. The Unbeliever in his agony Shall seek in whom to trust, And when his idols help him not, shall cry “O God! that I were dust!” Before the Faithful, as their troops arise, A glorious light shall play, And angels herald them to Paradise, To bliss without decay; Gardens of green, that pales not in the sun, And ever-budding flowers; Rivers that cool in brightest noon-day run, Nor need the shade of bowers; Seats of high honour and supreme repose, To which the laden trees Bend at desire, and every hour disclose Fresh tastes and fragrances; Deep cups of wine that bring no after-pain By angel-children plied, And love without satiety or stain For bridegroom or for bride. While yet a purer essence of delight Awaits the bolder few, That plunge their being in the Infinite, And rise to life anew. Oriental mysticism distinguishes itself from Christian by the predominance of the sensual character: it is the rapture of the soul, the ecstatic interfusion of pleasure and pain, the yearning towards the absorption of self in the Infinite, which is at the heart of the spiritual religion of the East, while with us there is much more sentiment, and a variety according to the character of the individual, unknown to Oriental Pantheism. Such was the guise of Truth that on its front The new religion wore, And in new words men followed, as is wont, Precepts they scorn'd before. And the Faith rose from families to tribes, From tribes to nations rose, And open enmities and ribald gibes Grew feeble to oppose. “Resigned to God” The meaning of the word “Muslim:”—“El Islam” also signifies “the resigning.” —this name the Faithful bore— This simple, noble name; And reckoned life a thing of little store, A transitory game. Thus was Endurance on the banner writ That led the Muslim forth, And wonder not that they who follow it Should conquer half the earth. What might the men not do, who thus could know No fear and fear no loss? One only thing—they could not overthrow The kingdom of the Cross. And this, because it held an element Beyond their spirits' range, A Truth for which the faith they represent Had nothing to exchange. One God the Arabian Prophet preached to man, One God the Orient still Adores through many a realm of mighty span, A God of Power and Will— A God that shrouded in His lonely light Rests utterly apart From all the vast Creations of His might, From Nature, Man, and Art:— A Being in whose solitary hand All other beings weigh No more than in the potter's reckoning stand The workings of his clay:— A Power that at its pleasure will create, To save or to destroy; And to eternal pain predestinate, As to eternal joy:— Mohammed carries out the doctrine of predestination with a merciless logic—“Would you force men to become believers? How can a soul believe without the will of God?” Chap. x. v. 99. “There shall be a great number of those that are saved among the ancient peoples, but few among those of modern times.” Chap. lvi. v. 13. The eternity of hell does not seem to be doubted. An unconditioned, irrespective, will, Demanding simple awe, Beyond all principles of good or ill, Above idea of law. No doctrine here of perfect Love divine, To which the bounds belong Only of that unalterable line Disparting right from wrong:— A love, that, while it must not regulate The issues of free-will, By its own sacrifice can expiate The penalties of ill. No message here of man redeemed from sin, Of fallen nature raised, By inward strife and moral discipline, Higher than e'er debased,— Of the immense parental heart that yearns From highest heaven to meet The poorest wandering spirit that returns To its Creator's feet. No Prophet here by common essence bound At once to God and man, Author Himself and part of the profound And providential plan: Himself the ensample of unuttered worth, Himself the living sign, How by God's grace the fallen sons of earth May be once more divine. —Thus in the faiths old Heathendom that shook Were different powers of strife; Mohammed's truth lay in a holy Book, Christ's in a sacred Life. So, while the world rolls on from change to change, And realms of thought expand, The Letter stands without expanse or range, Stiff as a dead man's hand; While, as the life-blood fills the growing form, The Spirit Christ has shed Flows through the ripening ages fresh and warm, More felt than heard or read. And therefore, though ancestral sympathies, And closest ties of race, May guard Mohammed's precept and decrees, Through many a tract of space, Yet in the end the tight-drawn line must break, The sapless tree must fall, Nor let the form one time did well to take Be tyrant over all. The tide of things rolls forward, surge on surge, Bringing the blessèd hour, When in Himself the God of Love shall merge The God of Will and Power. THE SONG OF THE WAHABEES. These Protestants of Mohammedanism owe their origin to the Sheykh Mohammed Ibn-Abd-El-Wahhab, who founded or incorporated them into a religion and political sect in 1745. They professed to restore Islam to its primitive purity, and to establish an ascetic morality throughout its followers. Like some other religious Reformers, they committed great devastation in places reputed holy, and gratified by the same acts their hatred of superstition and their love of gain. They forbade all luxury in dress and habits of life, and even interdicted the use of the pipe—almost a necessary of existence to the Oriental. The attention of the Porte was not long ago directed to their increasing power in Arabia and the molestations they offered to the pilgrims to the Holy Cities; and the present Pasha of Egypt, after many losses and repulses, succeeded in completely subduing them. Individuals of these tenets are still occasionally to be met with, but it is very difficult to draw from them any information or acknowledgment. We will not that the truth of God by prophets brought to earth Shall be o'erlaid by dreams and thoughts of none or little worth; We will not that the noblest Man, that ever lived and died, Should be for canting, cozening, Saints The whole notion of Hagiology is totally at variance with the original idea of Islam: nevertheless there is no city without its mosque, sanctified by the relics of the Prophet or his family, and hardly a district without the tomb of its local Saint. Part of the dress of the Prophet is yearly soaked in a large quantity of water, which is bottled into small vials, and sent to all the great dignitaries of the Empire. So vain have been the Prophet's efforts to establish a practical Monotheism. in reverence set aside. While God was uttering through his lips, and writing through his pen, Mohammed took his lot with us, a man with other men; And thus in our due love to him, and awe for God alone, We bless his memory as the chest that holds the precious stone. So, though 'tis well that where entombed, his holy body lies, Praises and prayers from faithful crowds to Allah's name should rise. The best of Mosques is still the tent where earnest Muslims meet, The best of Minarets is the rock that desert tempests beat. We all have Mekkeh in our hearts, who speak and act the truth; The Wahabees allowed a certain veneration for Mckkeh, as Protestantism permits for Jerusalem, but discouraged pilgrimages generally. We all are Saints who read the Book and worship from our youth. Men are no happier than they were for all El-Azhar's lore, The gre at college at Cairo, the Oxford of Arabia. And if our Faith wins Paradise, can knowledge win us more? We will not that the gifts of God, so good when used aright, Should leave their wholesome natural ends and turn to His despite; That men should change the sweetest flowers to bitter poison weeds: The Book has said that “everyone is hostage for his deeds.” Kuràn, chap. lii. v. 21. Man should be man; the world is his to conquer and command, No pipe or downy bed for him, but horse and sword in hand; Let they who will consume their lives in joys of vicious ease,— The Prophet's word will scarce prevail with Preachers such as these. Let women love Damascus silk, give us Damascus blades, The shawls of rich Cashmere look best on our Circassian maids; We wear the homely woollen woof, such as Mohammed wore, Nor steal from herbs the drunken dreams that he with wine forswore. We know that time is worst than lost, which is not used for gain, For Life is not a jest, and God will not create in vain,— And thus we will not rest while earth has idols still to fall; Till Islam is indeed Islam, and Allah God for all! ARABIAN LEGENDS. I. THE PRIDE OF NIMROD. “Thou art King of all the nations,— They are thine to take or give,— We are but thy will's creations,— In thy breath we die or live.” So the servile courtiers chanted, But the tyrant's heart replied That some stronger food was wanted To content his swollen pride. Now, behold, the myriads gather Round him,—work as he may bid, To invade God's realm of æther By the Babel pyramid: God the pitiful intrusion Checks not by his lightning hand, But imposing and confusion Frustrates every proud command. Allah then in arms defying, The Kuràn makes Pharaoh also build a huge tower to scale heaven with: Pharaoh ascended it when completed, and having thrown a javelin upwards, which fell back again stained with blood, boasted he had killed the God of Moses; but Gabriel, at one brush of his wing, demolished the tower, which fell, crushing a million of men. See the tyrant's golden car, With four harnessed eagles, flying Upward, through the air afar: Now he glows in rage delighted, Thinks he grasps Jehovah's throne, But that instant falls benighted On a desert rock alone. Hear, Believers! hear with wonder How, at last, God's vengeance came; Not in tempest, not in thunder, Not in pestilence or flame: One of Nature's meanest features, Hardly to your vision clear, Least of tiny insect creatures, Crept into the Tyrant's ear. There its subtle life it nested In the tissues of his brain, And the anguish never rested, And his being turned to pain: Thus four hundred years tormented, Nature's God he learnt to know, Yet his pride was unrepented, And he sunk to endless woe! II. ABRAHAM AND HIS GODS. Abraham is the great Patriarch of Arabia; he is declared by Mohammed to be neither a Jew nor a Christian, but a Muslim and the friend of God. The great idol of red agate, with a golden hand holding seven divining arrows, which Mohammed destroyed in the Kaabeh, after his capture of Mekkeh, is supposed to have been a representation of Abraham. The Black Stone set in silver, which the Prophet left there, and which has remained an object of idolatrous homage, is said to be one of the precious stones of Paradise, and to have been brought by the angel Gabriel to Abraham, when he was rebuilding the Kaabeh. The Books of Abraham are spoken of with those of Moses, chap. lxxxvii. v. 19; the Kuràn is full of him: Mohammed seems, whether intentionally or not, to have fused his character into his own; he makes Abraham speak as himself, and he himself speaks in the person of the Patriarch. The following story expresses either the process of Abraham's reasoning with himself, or was used, by way of argument, to convince the idolaters among whom he lived. Josephus (lib. i. cap. 8) writes of Abraham, “that he was the first that ventured to publish this notion, that there was but one God, the Creator of the Universe, and that, as to other gods, if they contributed anything to the happiness of man, each of them afford it only according to his appointment, and not by their own power: this his opinion was derived from the irregular phenomena that were visible both at land and sea, as well as those that happen to the sun and moon, and all the heavenly bodies.” Beneath the full-eyed Syrian moon, The Patriarch, lost in reverence, raised His consecrated head, and soon He knelt, and worshipped while he gazed: “Surely that glorious Orb on high Must be the Lord of earth and sky!” Slowly towards its central throne The glory rose, yet paused not there, But seemed by influence not its own Drawn downwards through the western air, Until it wholly sunk away, And the soft Stars had all the sway. Then to that hierarchy of light, With face upturned the sage remained,— “At least Ye stand for ever bright,— Your power has never waxed or waned!” Even while he spoke, their work was done, Drowned in the overflowing Sun. Eastward he bent his eager eyes— “Creatures of Night! false Gods and frail! Take not the worship of the wise, There is the Deity we hail; Fountain of light, and warmth, and love, He only bears our hearts above.” Yet was that One—that radiant One, Who seemed so absolute a King, Only ordained his round to run, And pass like each created thing; He rested not in noonday prime, But fell beneath the strength of time. Then like one labouring without hope To bring his toil to fruitful end, And powerless to discern the scope Whereto his aspirations tend, Still Abraham prayed by night and day— “God! teach me to what God to pray!” Nor long in vain; an inward Light Arose to which the Sun is pale, The knowledge of the Infinite, The sense of Truth that must prevail;— The presence of the only Lord By angels and by men adored. III. MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI. There is a Hebrew tradition that the Israelites asked two things of God, —to hear his voice and see his glory: these were granted them, and in consequence they fell down dead: but the Law (which is here a personality) addressed God, saying, “Shall a king give his daughter in marriage and destroy his own household? Thou hast given me to the world which rejoices in me, and shall the Israelites, thy children, perish?” Upon this, the dead were restored to life; for “the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” Ps. xix. 7. The Kuràn limits the vision of God to Moses. The leading events of that Prophet's life are there given with little variation from the Jewish scriptures: the events connected with the departure of the Jews from Egypt have, of course, afforded much scope to traditions of the marvellous. One miracle ascribed to him, as being exhibited for the terror of Pharaoh, is very picturesque, viz., that he was a most swarthy man, but when he placed his hand in his bosom, and drew it forth again, it became extremely white and splendid, surpassing the brightness of the sun. Up a rough peak, that toward the stormy sky From Sinai's sandy ridges rose aloft, Osarsiph, priest of Hieropolis, Now Moses named, ascending reverently To meet and hear the bidding of the Lord. But, though he knew that all his ancient lore Traditionary from the birth of Time, And all that power which waited on his hand, Even from the day his just instinctive wrath Had smote th' Egyptian ravisher, Not just according to the Kuràn, which makes Moses repent of it. Chap. xxvi. v. 19. and all The wisdom of his calm and ordered mind Were nothing in the presence of his God; Yet was there left a certain seed of pride, Vague consciousness of some self-centred strength, That made him cry, “Why, Lord, com'st thou to me, Only a voice, a motion of the air, A thing invisible, impalpable, Leaving a void, an unreality, Within my heart? I would, with every sense, Know thou wert there—I would be all in Thee! Let me at least behold Thee as Thou art; Disperse this corporal darkness by thy light; Hallow my vision by thy glorious form, So that my sense be blest for evermore!” Thus spoke the Prophet, and the Voice replied, As in low thunders over distant seas:— Beneath the height to which thy feet have striven, A hollow trench divides the cliffs of sand, Widen'd by rains and deepened every year. Gaze straight across it, for there opposite To where thou standest, I will place myself, And then, if such remain thy fixed desire, I will descend to side by side with thee.” So Moses gazed across the rocky vale; And the air darkened, and a lordly bird Poised in the midst of its long-journeying flight, And touched his feet with limp and fluttering wings And all the air around, above, below, Was metamorphosed into sound—such sound, That separate tones were undistinguishable, And Moses fell upon his face, as dead. Yet life and consciousness of life returned; And, when he raised his head, he saw no more The deep ravine and mountain opposite, But one large level of distracted rocks, With the wide desert quaking all around. Then Moses fell upon his face again, And prayed—“O! pardon the presumptuous thought, That I could look upon thy face and live: Wonder of wonders! that mine ear has heard Thy voice unpalsied, and let such great grace Excuse the audacious blindness that o'erleaps Nature's just bounds and thy discerning will!” IV. SOLOMON AND THE ANTS. Solomon is the Hero of Wisdom all over the East: but wisdom there must be manifested by power: he is therefore the great Magician, the ruler of all the spirits of Creation, and to whom all inferior creatures do homage. The Targum to the Book of Esther, i. 2, relates: “that Demons of the most different orders, and all evil Spirits, were submitted to his will.” The 8th verse of the 2nd chapter of Ecclesiastes has been interpreted to have a similar meaning. One of the singular uses to which he applied his power, according to the Mohammedan commentators, was to get the demons to make a depilatory to remove the hair from the legs of the Queen of Seba before he her. The following story from the Kuràn is evidently connected with the mention of the wonderful instincts of the ant, Proverbs, vi. 6, 7, 8. Of all the Kings of fallen earth, The sun has never shone On one to match in power and worth With ancient Solomon. Master of Genii and of Men, He ruled o'er sea and land; Nor bird in nest, nor beast in den, Was safe from his command. So past he, gloriously arrayed, One morning to review The creatures God on earth has made, And give Him homage due. Well busied in a valley near, A troop of Ants perceived The coming pomp—and struck with fear Death close at hand believed. They cried: “What care the Kings and Priests That here in splendour meet, What care the Genii, birds, or beasts, For us beneath their feet? For what are we to them, and who Shall check their mighty way? Fly to your inmost homes or rue The glory of to-day.” The son of David's wondrous ear No haughty mood beguiled; He, bent the Ant's small voice to hear, Beneficently smiled; And prayed: “Oh God! the great, the good, Of kings Almighty King! Preserve my progress free from blood, Or hurt to living thing! “Comfort these humble creatures' fear; Let all thy servants know, That I thy servant, too, am here, Thy power, not mine, to show. That, 'mid the tumult and the tread Of myriads, I will guard Secure from hurt each little head, As thou wilt me reward.” And thus the Ants that marvellous scene Beheld, as glad a throng, As if their tiny forms had been The strongest of the strong. V. FALLING STARS. The angels on th' eternal thrones In ecstacies of song conspire, And mingle their seraphic tones With words of wisdom, words of fire; Discourse so subtle and so sweet That should it strike on human ear, That soul must leave its base retreat, Attracted to a loftier sphere. So the sad Spirits, whom the will Of God exiles to outer pain, Yearning in their dark bosoms still For all their pride might most disdain, Round the serene celestial halls Hover in agonised suspense, To catch the slightest sound that falls, The faintest breeze that murmurs thence. But holy instinct strikes a sting Into each pure angelic breast, The moment any sinful thing Approaches its religious rest; And when their meteor darts are hurled Th' audacious listeners to surprise, 'Tis said by mortals in their world, That Stars are falling in the Skies. VI. THE INFANCY OF MOHAMMED. This legend does not seem to me to be orthodox, but rather to be a later invention arising from a desire to assimilate the nature of Mohammed to that of Christ. The humility of Mohammed in all that concerns his personality is conspicuous throughout the Kuràn. “I do not say unto you, that in my possession are the treasures of God, nor that I know what is unseen; nor do I say unto you, Verily I am an angel,—I only follow what is revealed to me.” Chap. vi. v. 50. “Mohammed is nought but an Apostle: other Apostles have passed away before him.” Chap. iii. v. 138. Nor does Mohammed even attribute to himself any specialty of nature such as he gives to Christ, whom he declares to have been born of a Virgin by the Spirit of God. “She said, O my Lord, how shall I have a son, when a man hath not touched me? He answered—Thus. God will create what he pleaseth. When he determineth a thing, he only saith unto it, Be, and it is.” An Arab nurse, that held in arms a sleeping Arab child, Had wandered from the parents' tents some way into the wild. She knew that all was friendly round, she had no cause to fear, Although the rocks strange figures made and night was threatening near. Yet something kin to dread she felt, when sudden met her sight Two forms of noble maintenance and beautifully bright. Their robes were dipt in sunset hues—their faces shone on high, As Sirius or Canopus shine in purest summer sky. Straight up to her without a word they walked, yet in their gaze Was greeting, that with subtle charm might temper her amaze. One, with a mother's gentleness, then took the slumbering child That breathed as in a happy dream, and delicately smiled: Passed a gold knife across his breast, that opened without pain, Took out its little beating Heart—all pure but one black stain. Amid the ruddy founts of life in foul stagnation lay That thick black stain like cancerous ill that eats the flesh away. The other Form then placed the heart on his white open hand, And poured on it a magic flood, no evil could withstand: And by degrees the deep disease beneath the wondrous cure Vanished, and that one mortal Heart became entirely pure. With earnest care they laid it back within the infant's breast, Closed up the gaping wound, and gave the blessing of the blest: Imprinting each a burning kiss upon its even brow, And placed it in the nurse's arms, and passed she knew not how. Thus was Mohammed's fresh-born Heart made clean from Adam's sin, Thus in the Prophet's life did God his work of grace begin. VII. MOHAMMED AND THE MISER. There was wailing in the village—not the woe of hireling tears, There was sorrow all around it—not the grief of servile fears, Though the good Abdallah dying, to his son's especial care Had bequeathed his needy neighbours, making him his virtue's heir. But in this our earthly being virtue will not follow blood, Good will often spring from evil, evil often rise from good; So th' ensample of his father, and the trust to him consigned, Could not change the rebel nature, could not raise the niggard mind. 'Twas the season when the date-trees, cultured in their seemly plan, Yield their sweet and wholesome burden into the glad lap of man; Then it was Abdallah's custom to collect the poor around, To up-glean the casual fruitage, freely scattered on the ground. But that year about the date-grove palisades were planted strong, Watchers placed to guard the entrance, watchers all the wall along; And the Lord announced his harvest on the morrow should begin, Swearing he would slay the peasant that should creep the pale within. Passing near, the Prophet wondered at the loud lament he heard, And he proffered them his counsel, and he soothed them with his word, And he bade them trust in Allah, Father of the rich and poor, One who wills not that his children pine before their brother's door. Thundering from the sandy mountains all that night the tempest came, All that night the veil of water fell before the flashing flame, And when dawn the Master summoned to review his promised gain, Not the date-fruit, but the date-trees, strewed the desolated plain. VIII. MOHAMMED AND THE BLIND ABDALLAH. Referred to in chap. 80 of the Kuràn. Abdallah Ebn Omm Maktoun seems to have been a man of no rank or importance, but was treated with great respect by the Prophet ever after this adventure. It is interesting that Mohammed should make his own faults and the divine reproofs he received a matter of revelation, and a stronger proof of his sincerity and earnestness could hardly be given. The blind Abdallah sought the tent Where, 'mid the eager listening croud, Mohammed gave his wisdom vent, And, entering fast, he cried aloud— “O Father, full of love and ruth! My soul and body both are blind; Pour on me then some rays of truth From thine illuminated mind.” Perchance the Prophet heard him not, Or busied well, seemed not to hear, Or, interrupted, then forgot How all mankind to God are dear: Disputing with the great and strong, He frowned in momentary pride, While through the jeering outer throng Th' unnoticed suppliant crept aside. But, in the calm of that midnight, The Voice that seldom kept aloof From his blest pillow spoke the right, And uttered words of stern reproof:— “How dost thou know that poor man's soul Did not on thy regard depend? The rich and proud thy moods controul;— I meant thee for the mourner's friend.” Deep in the Prophet's contrite heart The holy reprimand remained, And blind Abdallah for his part Kindness and reverence then obtained: Twice, after years of sacred strife, Within Medeenah's walls he ruled, The man through whom Mohammed's life Into its perfect grace was schooled. And, from the warning of that night, No one, however humble, past Without salute the Prophet's sight, Or felt his hand not held the last: And every one was free to hear His high discourse, and in his breast Unburden theirs without a fear Of troubling his majestic rest. Thus too, when Muslim Muslim meets, Though new the face and strange the road, His “Peace be on you” sweetly greets The ear, and lightens many a load: Proclaiming that in Allah's plan True men of every rank and race Form but one family of man, One Paradise their resting-place. Salutation in the East seems almost a religious ordinance, and good manners part of the duty of a good Muslim. IX. MOHAMMED AND THE ASSASSIN. “Leave me, my followers, leave me; The best-loved voices grieve me When falls the weary day: My heart to God is yearning, My soul to God returning: Leave me alone to pray.” So had the Prophet spoken: The silence was unbroken; While on a tree close by He hung his arms victorious, And raised his forehead glorious As glows the western sky. Fast as the sun descended, Further the Prophet wended His course behind the hill; Where, at his motives prying, An Arab foe was lying, Hid by a sand-heap still. One of a hateful tribe, Treating with scorn and gibe God and the Prophet's name: Creatures of evil lust, Base as the desert dust, Proud of their very shame! With upraised sword behind him, Burning to slay or bind him, Stealthy the traitor trod; He cried, “At last I brave thee! Whom hast thou now to save thee?” “God,” said the Prophet, “God!” Guardian of Allah's choice, Gabriel had heard that voice— Had seen the felon's brand; Swift from his hand he tore it, Swift as an arrow bore it Into the Prophet's hand. O vain design, and senseless, To find the man defenceless Whom God loves like a son! He cried, “Who now shall save thee? Which of the friends God gave thee?” “None,” said the Arab, “none!” “Yes,” said the Prophet, “One— Evil the deed now done— Still thou hast found a friend: Only believe and bow To him who has saved thee now, Whose mercy knows no end.” EASTERN THOUGHTS I. THE THINKER AND THE POET. Sunshine often falls refulgent After all the corn is in; Often Allah grants indulgent Pleasure that may guard from sin: Hence your wives may number four; Though he best consults his reason, Best secures his house from treason, Who takes one and wants no more. Nor less well the man once gifted With one high and holy Thought, Will not let his mind be shifted, But adores it, as he ought; Well for him whose spirit's youth Rests as a contented lover, Nor can other charms discover Than in his absorbing Truth! But the heaven-enfranchised Poet Must have no exclusive home, He must feel, and freely show it,— Phantasy is made to roam: He must give his passions range, He must serve no single duty, But from Beauty pass to Beauty, Constant to a constant change. With all races, of all ages, He must people his Hareem; He must search the tents of sages, He must scour the vales of dream: Ever adding to his store, From new cities, from new nations, He must rise to new creations, And, unsated, ask for more. In the manifold, the various, He delights, as Nature's child,— Grasps at joys the most precarious, Rides on hopes, however wild! Though his heart at times perceives One enduring Love hereafter, Glimmering through his tears and laughter, Like the sun through autumn leaves. II. THE EASTERN EPICUREAN. You are moaning, “Life is waning,” You are droning, “Flesh is weak:” Tell me too, what I am gaining While I listen, while you speak. If you say the rose is blooming, But the blast will soon destroy it, Do so, not to set me glooming, But to make me best enjoy it. Calm the heart's insatiate yearning Towards the distant, the unknown: Only do so, without turning Men to beasts, or flesh to stone. Cry not loud, “The world is mad! Lord! how long shall folly rule?” If you've nothing but the sad To replace the jovial fool. Sorrow is its own clear preacher,— Death is still on Nature's tongue;— Life and joy require the teacher, Honour Youth and keep it young. Even you, ascetics, rightly, Should appreciate Love and Joy;— For what you regard so lightly Where's the merit to destroy? III. “To endure and to pardon is the wisdom of life.” Kuràn, 42, v. 41. Father! if we may well endure The ill that with our lives begins, May'st Thou, to whom all things are pure, Endure our follies and our sins! Brothers! if we return you good For evil thought or malice done, Doubt not, that in our hearts a blood As hot as in your own may run. IV. PHYSICAL AND MORAL BLINDNESS. The hab'ts here alluded to are familiar to every traveller in those parts of the East where a large portion of the population are subject to ophthalmia and other diseases of the eyes, brought on by dirt and carelessness. In Egypt the number is much increased by those who have blinded themselves, or been blinded by their parents, to avoid the conscription. The child whose eyes were never blest With heavenly light, or lost it soon, About another's neck will rest Its arm, and walk like you at noon; The blind old man will place his palm Upon a child's fresh-blooming head, And follow through the croud in calm That infantine and trusty tread. We, too, that in our spirits dark Traverse a wild and weary way, May in these sweet resources mark A lesson, and be safe as they: Resting, when young, in happy faith On fair affection's daily bond, And afterwards resigned to death, Feeling the childly life beyond. V. DISCORDANT ELEMENTS. In the sight of God all-seeing Once a handful of loose foam Played upon the sea of being, Like a child about its home: In his smile it shone delighted, Danced beneath his swaying hand, But at last was cast benighted On the cold and alien land. Can it wait till waves returning Bear it to its parent breast? Can it bear the noontide's burning, Dwelling Earth's contented guest? Oh! no,—it will filter slowly Through the hard ungenial shore, Till each particle be wholly In the deep absorbed once more. VI. THE TWO THEOLOGIES. THE MYSTIC It must be that the light divine That on your soul is pleased to shine Is other than what falls on mine: For you can fix and formalize The Power on which you raise your eyes, And trace him in his palace-skies; You can perceive and almost touch His attributes as such and such, Almost familiar overmuch. You can his thoughts and ends display, In fair historical array, From Adam to the judgment-day. You can adjust to time and place The sweet effusions of his grace, And feel yourself before his face. You walk as in some summer night, With moon or stars serenely bright, On which you gaze—at ease—upright. But I am like a flower sun-bent, Exhaling all its life and scent Beneath the heat omnipotent. I have not comforts such as you,— I rather suffer good than do,— Yet God is my Deliverer too. I cannot think Him here or there— I think Him ever everywhere— Unfading light, unstifled air. I lay a piteous mortal thing,— Yet shadowed by his spirit's wing, A deathless life could in me spring: And thence I am, and still must be; What matters whether I or He?— Little was there to love in me. I know no beauty, bliss, or worth, In that which we call Life on earth, That we should mourn its loss or dearth: That we should sorrow for its sake, If God will the imperfect take Unto Himself, and perfect make. O Lord! our separate lives destroy! Merge in thy gold our soul's alloy,— Pain is our own, and Thou art Joy! VII. LOSS AND GAIN. Myriad Roses, unregretted, perish in their vernal bloom, That the essence of their sweetness once your Beauty may perfume. Myriad Veins of richest life-blood empty for their priceless worth, To exalt one Will imperial over spacious realms of earth. Myriad Hearts are pained and broken that one Poet may be taught To discern the shapes of passion and describe them as he ought. Myriad Minds of heavenly temper pass as passes moon or star, That one philosophic Spirit may ascend the solar car. Sacrifice and Self-devotion hallow earth and fill the skies, And the meanest Life is sacred whence the highest may arise. VIII. THE MOTH. Parted from th' eternal presence, Into life the Soul is born, In its fragmentary essence Left unwittingly forlorn. In the shrubbery's scented shadows First the insect tries its wings, In the evening's misty meadows It pursues the faëry rings. Where the trelliced roses clamber, And the jasmine peeps between, Looks the gardener's lowly chamber On the garden—on the green. Through the sultry veil of vapour, Like a nearer nether star, Shines the solitary taper, Seen and known by friend afar. Then the Moth, by strange attraction, Leaves the garden, leaves the field, Cannot rest in sweet inaction, Cannot taste what earth can yield. As the lov'd one to the lover, As a treasure, once your own, That you might some way recover, Seems to him that fiery cone. Round he whirls with pleasure tingling— Shrinks aghast—returns again— Ever wildly intermingling Deep delight and burning pain. Highest nature wills the capture, “Light to light” th' instinct cries, And, in agonising rapture, Falls the Moth, and bravely dies! Think not what thou art, Believer; Think but what thou may'st become; For the World is thy deceiver, And the Light thy only home! IX. THE SAYINGS OF RABIA. Rabia was a holy woman, who lived in the second century of the Hegira. Her sayings and thoughts are collected by many devotional Arabic writers: they are a remarkable development of a purely Christian mystical spirit so early in the history of Islam; the pantheistic mysticism of Sufism soon followed, and obtained a signal victory over the bare positive theism of the Prophet, clothing the heartless doctrine with a radiant vesture of imagination. I. A pious friend one day of Rabia asked, How she had learnt the truth of Allah wholly? By what instructions was her memory tasked— How was her heart estranged from this world's folly? She answered—“Thou who knowest God in parts, Thy spirit's moods and processes, can tell; I only know that in my heart of hearts I have despised myself and loved Him well.” II. Some evil upon Rabia fell, And one who loved and knew her well Murmured that God with pain undue Should strike a child so fond and true: But she replied—“Believe and trust That all I suffer is most just; I had in contemplation striven To realise the joys of heaven; I had extended fancy's flights Through all that region of delights,— Had counted, till the numbers failed, The pleasures on the blest entailed,— Had sounded the ecstatic rest I should enjoy on Allah's breast; And for those thoughts I now atone That were of something of my own, And were not thoughts of Him alone.” III. When Rabia unto Mekkeh came, She stood awhile apart—alone, Nor joined the croud with hearts on flame Collected round the sacred stone. She, like the rest, with toil had crossed The waves of water, rock, and sand, And now, as one long tempest-tossed, Beheld the Kaabeh's promised land. Yet in her eyes no transport glistened; She seemed with shame and sorrow bowed; The shouts of prayer she hardly listened, But beat her heart and cried aloud:— “O heart! weak follower of the weak, That thou should'st traverse land and sea, In this far place that God to seek Who long ago had come to thee!” IV. Round holy Rabia's suffering bed The wise men gathered, gazing gravely— “Daughter of God!” the youngest said, “Endure thy Father's chastening bravely; They who have steeped their souls in prayer Can every anguish calmly bear.” She answered not, and turned aside, Though not reproachfully nor sadly; “Daughter of God!” the eldest cried, “Sustain thy Father's chastening gladly, They who have learnt to pray aright, From pain's dark well draw up delight.” Then she spoke out,—“Your words are fair; But, oh! the truth lies deeper still; I know not, when absorbed in prayer, Pleasure or pain, or good or ill; They who God's face can understand Feel not the motions of His hand.” X. PLEASURE AND PAIN. Who can determine the frontier of Pleasure? Who can distinguish the limit of Pain? Where is the moment the feeling to measure? When is experience repeated again? Ye who have felt the delirium of passion— Say, can ye sever its joys and its pangs? Is there a power in calm contemplation To indicate each upon each as it hangs? I would believe not;—for spirit will languish While sense is most blest and creation most bright; And life will be dearer and clearer in anguish Than ever was felt in the throbs of delight. See the Fakeer as he swings on his iron, See the thin Hermit that starves in the wild; Think ye no pleasures the penance environ, And hope the sole bliss by which pain is beguiled? No! in the kingdoms those spirits are reaching, Vain are our words the emotions to tell; Vain the distinctions our senses are teaching, For Pain has its Heaven and Pleasure its Hell! XI. THE PEACE OF GOD. “The blessed shall hear no vain words, but only the word—Peace.” Kuran, chap. xix. v. 63. Peace is God's direct assurance To the souls that win release From this world of hard endurance— Peace—he tells us—only Peace. There is Peace in lifeless matter— There is Peace in dreamless sleep— Will then Death our being shatter In annihilation's deep? Ask you this? O mortal trembler! Hear the Peace that Death affords— For your God is no dissembler, Cheating you with double words:— To this life's inquiring traveller, Peace of knowledge of all good; To the anxious truth-unraveller, Peace of wisdom understood:— To the loyal wife, affection Towards her husband, free from fear,— To the faithful friend, selection Of all memories kind and dear:— To the lover, full fruition Of an unexhausted joy,— To the warior, crowned ambition, With no envy's base alloy:— To the ruler, sense of action, Working out his great intent,— To the prophet, satisfaction In the mission he was sent:— To the poet, conscious glory Flowing from his Father's face:— Such is Peace in holy story, Such is Peace in heavenly grace. XII. CHRISTIAN ENDURANCE. TO HARRIET MARTINEAU. Mortal! that standest on a point of time, With an eternity on either hand, Thou hast one duty above all sublime, Where thou art placed serenely there to stand: To stand undaunted by the threatening death, Or harder circumstance of living doom, Nor less untempted by the odorous breath Of Hope, that rises even from the tomb. For Hope will never dull the present pain, And Time will never keep thee safe from fall, Unless thou hast in thee a mind to reign Over thyself, as God is over all. 'Tis well on deeds of good, though small, to thrive, 'Tis well some part of ill, though small, to cure, 'Tis well with onward, upward, hopes to strive, Yet better and diviner to endure. What but this virtue's solitary power, Through all the lusts and dreams of Greece and Rome, Bore the selected spirits of the hour Safe to a distant, immaterial home? What but this lesson, resolutely taught, Of Resignation, The meaning of the word “Muslim:”—“El Islam” also signifies “the resigning.” as God's claim and due, Hallows the sensuous hopes of Eastern thought, And makes Mohammed's mission almost true? But in that patience was the seed of scorn— Scorn of the world and brotherhood of man; Not patience such as in the manger born Up to the cross endured its earthly span. Thou must endure, yet loving all the while, Above, yet never separate from, thy kind,— Meet every frailty with the gentlest smile, Though to no possible depth of evil blind. This is the riddle thou hast life to solve; But in the task thou shalt not work alone: For, while the worlds about the sun revolve, God's heart and mind are ever with his own! THE KIOSK. Story-telling is, now as ever, the delight of the East: in the coffee and summer houses, at the corners of the streets, in the courts of the mosque, sit the grave and attentive crowd, hearing with childly pleasure the same stories over and over again, applauding every new turn of expression or incident, but not requiring them any more than the hearers of a European sermon. Beneath the shadow of a large-leaved plane, Above the ripple of a shallow stream, Beside a cypress-planted cemetery, In a gay-painted trellis-worked kiosk, A company of easy Muslims sat, Enjoying the calm measure of delight God grants the faithful even here on earth. Most pleasantly the bitter berry tastes, Handed by that bright-eyed and neat-limbed boy; Most daintily the long chibouk is filled And almost before emptied, filled again; Or, with a free good-will, from mouth to mouth Passes the cool Nargheelee The hookah of the Levant. serpentine. So sit they, with some low occasional word Breaking the silence in itself so sweet, While o'er the neighbouring bridge the caravan Winds slowly in one line interminable Of camel after camel, each with neck Jerked up, as sniffing the far desert air. Then one serene old Turk, with snow-white beard Hanging amid his pistol-hilts profuse, Spoke out—“Till sunset all the time is ours, And we should take advantage of the chance That brings us here together. This my friend Tells by his shape of dress and peakèd cap Where his home lies: he comes from furthest off, So let the round of tales begin with him.” Thus challenged, in his thoughts the Persian dived, And, with no waste of faint apologies, Related a plain story of his life, Nothing adventurous, terrible, or strange, But, as he said, a simple incident, That any one there present might have known. THE PERSIAN'S STORY. “Wakedi, and the Heshemite, and I, Called each the other friend, and what we meant By all the meaning of that common word, One tale among a hundred—one round pearl Dropped off the chain of daily circumstance Into the Poet's hand—one luscious fruit Scarce noticed in the summer of the tree, Is here preserved, that you may do the like. “The Ramadhan's long days (where'er they fall Certain to seem the longest of the year) Were nearly over, and the populous streets Were silent as if haunted by the plague; For all the town was crowding the bazaar, To buy new garments, as beseemed the time, In honour of the Prophet and themselves. But in our house my wife and I still sat, And looked with sorrow in each other's face. It was not for ourselves—we well could let Our present clothes serve out another year, And meet the neighbours' scoffs with quiet minds; But for our children we were grieved and shamed; That they should have to hide their little heads, And take no share of pleasure in the Feast, Or else contrast their torn and squalid vests With the gay freshness of their playmates' garb. At last my wife spoke out—‘Where are your friends? Where is Wakedi? where the Heshemite? That you are worn and pale with want of gold, And they perchance with coin laid idly by In some closed casket, or in some vain sport Wasted, for want of honest purposes?’ My heart leapt light within me at these words, And I, rejoicing at my pain as past, Sent one I trusted to the Heshemite, Told him my need in few plain written words, And, ere an hour had passed, received from him A purse of gold tied up, sealed with his name: And in a moment I was down the street, And, in my mind's eye, chose the children's clothes. —But between will and deed, however near, There often lies a gulf impassable. So, ere I reached the gate of the Bazaar, Wakedi's slave accosted me—his breath Cut short with haste; and from his choaking throat His master's message issued word by word. The sum was this:—a cruel creditor, Taking the 'vantage of the season's use, Pressed on Wakedi for a debt, and swore That, unless paid ere evening-prayer, the law Should wring by force the last of his demand. Wakedi had no money in the house, And I was prayed, in this his sudden strait, To aid him, in my duty as a friend. Of course I took the Heshemite's sealed purse Out of my breast, and gave it to the slave; Yet I must own, oppressed with foolish fear Of my wife's tears, and, might be, bitter words, If empty-handed I had home returned, I sat all night, half-sleeping, in the mosque, Beneath the glimmering feathers, eggs, and lamps, And only in the morning nerved my heart, To tell her of our disappointed pride. She, when I stammered out my best excuse, Abashed me with her kind approving calm, Saying—‘The parents' honour clothes the child.’ Thus I grew cheerful in her cheerfulness, And we began to sort the children's vests, And found them not so sordid after all. ‘This might be turned—that stain might well be hid— This remnant might be used.’ So we went on Almost contented, till surprised we saw The Heshemite approach, and with quick steps Enter the house, and in his hand he showed The very purse tied up, sealed with his name, Which I had given to help Wakedi's need! At once he asked us, mingling words and smiles, ‘What means this secret? you sent yester morn Asking for gold, and I, without delay, Returned the purse containing all I had. But I too found myself that afternoon Wanting to buy a sash to grace the feast; And sending to Wakedi, from my slave Received this purse I sent you the same morn Unopened.’ ‘Easy riddle,’ I replied, ‘And, as I hope, no miracle for me— That what you gave me for my pleasure's fee Should serve Wakedi in his deep distress.’ And then I told him of Wakedi's fate: And we were both o'ercome with anxious care Lest he, obeying his pure friendship's call, Had perilled his own precious liberty, Or suffered some hard judgment of the law. But to our great delight and inward peace, Wakedi a few moments after stood Laughing behind us, ready to recount, How Allah, loving the unshrinking faith With which he had supplied his friend's desire Regardless of his own necessity, Assuaged the creditor's strong rage, and made His heart accessible to gentle thoughts, Granting Wakedi time to pay the debt. —Thus our three tales were gathered into one, Just as I give them you, and with the purse Then opened in the presence of the three— We gave my children unpretending vests, Applied a portion to Wakedi's debts, And bought the Heshemite the richest sash The best silk merchant owned in the Bazaar.” Soon as he ceased, a pleasant murmur rose, Not only of applause, but of good words, Dwelling upon the subject of the tale; Each to his neighbour in low utterance spoke Of Friendship and its blessings, and God's grace, By which man is not left alone to fight. His daily battle through a cruel world. The next in order, by his garb and look, A Syrian merchant seemed, who made excuse That he had nothing of his own to tell, But if the adventure of one like himself, Who roamed the world for interchange of gain, Encountering all the quaint varieties Of men and nature, pleased them, it was theirs. THE SYRIAN'S STORY. “A merchant of Damascus, to whom gain Tasted the sweetest when most boldly won, Crossed the broad Desert, crossed th' Arabian Gulf, Entered with goods the far-secluded land That Franks call Abyssinia, and became The favourite and companion of its King. And little wonder—for to that rude chief He spoke of scenes and sights so beautiful, Of joys and splendours that had hardly place In his imagined Paradise, of arts By which all seasons were made sweet and mild. In the hot sandy winds and blazing sun, He spoke of alleys of delicious shade, Of coloured glass that tempered the sharp light, Of fountains bubbling up through heaps of flowers, And boys and maidens fanning genial airs: In the bleak snow-time, when the winds rung shrill Through the ill-jointed palace, he pourtrayed The Syrian winter of refreshing cool, And breezes pregnant with all health to man. At last the King no more could hold in check The yearning of his heart, and spoke aloud— ‘Friend! what is now to me my royal state, My free command of all these tribes of men, My power to slay or keep alive,—my wealth, Which once I deemed the envy of all kings,— If by my life amid these wild waste hills I am shut out from that deliciousness Which makes existence heavenly in your words,— If I must pass into my Father's tomb, These pleasures all untasted, this bright earth To me in one dark corner only known? Why should I not, for some, short time, lay by My heavy sceptre, and with wealth in hand, And thee to guide and light me in my path, Travel to those fair countries God-endowed,— And then with store of happy memories, And thoughts, for pauses of the lion-hunt, And tales to tell, to keep the evenings warm, Return once more to my paternal throne?’ Gladly the merchant, weary with his stay In that far land, and fearing lest kind force Might hold him prisoner there for some long time, Accepted the proposal, praised the scheme As full of wise, and just, and manly thought, Recounted the advantages the land Would from their King's experience surely draw: And ended by determining the day When they two should set out upon their road, Worthily armed, with ample store of gold, And gems adroitly hid about their dress. “The day arrived, big with such change of life To this brave Monarch: in barbaric pomp Were gathered all the princes of the race, All men of name and prowess in the state, And tributary chiefs from Ethiop hills. With mingled admiration and dismay They heard the King announce he should go forth To distant nations ere that sun went down;— That for two years they would not see his face; But then he trusted God he should return Enriched with wisdom, worthier of his rule, And able to impart much good to them. Then to the trust of honourable men Committing separate provinces and towns, And over all, in delegated rule, Establishing his favourite brother's power, Amid applauses, tumults, prayers, and tears, Towards the Arabian Gulf he bent his way. A well-manned boat lay ready on the shore; A prosperous gale was playing on the sea; And after some few days of pleasant sail, From Djedda's port to Mekkeh's blessed walls The Merchant and the King advanced alone. “At every step he made in this new world, At every city where they stopped a while On their long journey, with the fresh delight His eye was ravished and his heart was full; And when at last upon his vision flashed Holy Damascus, Statius (Sylv. 1, 6, 14), speaks of Syrian plums, as, “Quod ramis pia germinat Damascus.” with its mosques, and streams, A gem of green set in the golden sand, The King embraced his friend; and, thanking God That he had led him to this heaven, despised The large dominion of his Afric birth, And vowed he'd rather be a plain man there, Than rule o'er all the sources of the Nile. Thus in Damascus they were safely housed, And as the King's gold through the Merchant's hands Flowed freely, friends came pouring in amain, Deeming it all the fortunate reward Of the bold Merchants venture; for he spoke To none about the secret King, who seemed Rather some humble fond companion brought From the far depths of that gold-teeming land. Oh! what a life of luxury was there! Velvet divans, curtains of broidered silk, Carpets, as fine a work of Persian looms As those that in the Mosque at Mekkeh lie; The longest, straitest, pipes in all the East, With amber mouth-pieces as clear as air; Fresh sparkling sherbet, such as Franks adore; Our champagne is the favourite sherbet of the East. And maidens who might dazzle by their charms The Sultan seated in his full Hareem. The months rolled on with no diminished joys, Nay, each more lavish in magnificence Than that which went before; and, drunk with pleasure, The Merchant lost all sense and estimate Of the amount of wealth he and the King Had brought together from that distant clime. The gold was soon exhausted, yet remained A princely store of jewels, which for long Sustained that fabric of enchanted life, But one by one were spent and passed away; Then came the covert sale of splendours bought; Then money borrowed easily at first, But every time extracted with more pain From the strong griping clutch of usury. But all the while, unwitting of the truth, Without the faintest shadow of distrust Of his friend's prudence, care, or honesty, Taking whatever share of happiness He gave him with an absolute content, Tranquil the Abyssinian King remained, Confiding and delighted as a child. “At last the hour came on, though long delayed, When the bare fact before the Merchant's eyes Stood out, that he was ruined without hope! What could be done? Not only for himself, But for his friend, that poor deluded King, Become an useless burthen on his hands? He knew his doors, that guests so lately thronged, Would soon be thronged as thick with creditors; And he himself, by law, be forced to pay In person, where he had no gold to give: He must escape that very hour—but how? Without one good piastre to defray His cost upon the road, or bribe the porters To set his creditors on some false scent. Then rose a thought within him, and, it seemed, Was gladly welcomed by a sudden start, And a half-cruel, half-compassionate, smile. For straight he sought the Abyssinian King, Whom he found watching with a quiet smile The gold fish in the fountain gleam and glide. He led him, ever ductile, by the hand Down many streets into a close-built court Where sat together many harsh-browed men, Whom he accosted thus: ‘Friends, I want gold; Here is a slave I brought with me last year From Abyssinia; he is stout and strong, And, but for some strange crotchets in his head Of his own self-importance and fond dreams, Which want a little waking now and then By means that you at least know well to use, A trusty servant and long-headed man; Take him at your own price—I have no time To drive a bargain.’ ‘Well, so much,’—one cried— ‘So much’ another. ‘Bring your purses out, You have bid most, and let me count the coin.’ Dumb as a rock the Abyssinian King, Gathering the meaning of the villany, Stood for a while; then, in a frantic burst, Rushed at his base betrayer, who, his arm Avoiding, gathered up his gold and fled: And the slave-merchant, as a man to whom All wild extremities of agony Were just as common as his daily bread, Shouted, and like a felon in a cage The King was soon forced down by many hands. “None know what afterwards became of him: Haply he died, as was the best for him; And, but that the false Merchant, proud of crime, Oft told the story as a good device And laughable adventure of his craft, The piteous fate of that deluded King Had been as little known to anyone As to the subjects of his distant realm, Who still, perchance, expect their Lord's return, Laden with all the wealth of Eastern lands.” 'Twas strange to see how upon different minds The Syrian's tale with different meanings fell. One moralised of the vicissitudes Of mortal greatness, how the spider's web Is just as safe from harm and violence As the bright-woven destiny of kings. Another cursed the Merchant for his deed: And a third laughed aloud and laughed again, Considering the strange contrast of the pomp Of that departure from a regal throne And grand commission of so many powers, With the condition of a kennelled slave; For true it is, that nothing moves to mirth More than the gap that fortune often leaps, Dragging some wretched man along with her. To an Egyptian soldier, scarred and bronzed, The duty of narration came the next: Who said, “that soldiers' tales were out of place Told in calm places and at evening hours: His songs required the music of the gun: He could recount a thousand desperate feats, Hair-breadth escapes and miracles of war, Were he but cowering round a low watch-fire Almost in hearing of the enemy; But now his blood was cold, and he was dull, And even had forgot his own wild past. They all had heard—had East and West not heard Of Mehemet Ali and of Ibrahim? It might be that the Great Pasha was great, But he was fond of trade—of getting gold, Not by fair onslaught and courageous strength, But by mean interchange with other lands Of produce better in his own consumed; This was like treason to a soldier's heart; And all he hoped was that when Ibrahim Sat in his father's seat, he would destroy That flight of locusts—Jew, and Greek, and Frank, Who had corrupted Egypt and her power, By all their mercenary thoughts and acts, And sent him there, brave soldier as he was, To go beg service at the Sultan's hand. Yet Ibrahim's heart was still a noble one; No man could contradict him and not fear Some awful vengeance;—was this story known?” THE EGYPTIAN'S STORY “Once, when in Syria he had let war loose, And was reducing, under one strong sway, Druses, and Christians, and Mohammedans, He heard that his lost child, the favourite Born of a favourite wife, had been let fall By a young careless Nubian nurse, and hurt, So as to cripple it through all its days. No word of anger passed the warrior's lips,— No one would think the story on his mind Rested a single moment. But due time Brought round his glad return, and he once more Entered his hall, within which, on each side, Long marble stairs curved towards the balcony, Where right and left the women's chambers spread; Upon the landing stood the glad Hareem To welcome him with music, shouts, and songs; Yet he would not ascend a single step, But cried—‘Where is the careless Nubian girl That let my child fall on the stony ground?’ Trembling and shrieking down one marble flight She was pushed forward, till she reached the floor: Then Ibrahim caught her in one giant grasp, Dragged her towards him, and one brawny hand Tight-twisting in her long and glossy hair, And with the other drawing the sharp sword Well known at Nezib and at Koniah, Sheer from her shoulders severed the young head, And casting it behind him, at few bounds Cleared the high stair and to his bosom pressed The darling wife his deed had just reveng'd. O! he is god-like in his hour of rage! His wrath is like the plague that falls on man With indiscriminate fury, and for this His name is honoured through the spacious East, Where all things powerful meet their just reward.” The Soldier paused; and surely some one else Had taken up the burden of a tale; But at that moment through the cypress stems Shot the declining crimson of the sun Full on the faces of that company, Who for some instants in deep silence watched The last appearance of the ruddy rim, And, little needing the clear warning voice Which issued round the neighbouring minaret,— Bidding all earthly thoughts and interests Sink in their breasts as sunk that fiery sun— Bowed, old and young, their heads in blest accord, Believers in one Prophet and one God! THE TENT. Why should a man raise stone and wood Between him and the sky? Why should he fear the brotherhood Of all things from on high? Why should a man not raise his form As shelterless and free As stands in sunshine or in storm The mountain and the tree? Or if we thus, as creatures frail Before our time should die, And courage and endurance fail Weak Nature to supply;— Let us at least a dwelling choose, The simplest that can keep From parching heat and noxious dews Our pleasure and our sleep. The Fathers of our mortal race, While still remembrance nursed Traditions of the glorious place Whence Adam fled accursed,— Rested in tents, as best became Children, whose mother earth Had overspread with sinful shame The beauty of her birth. In cold they sought the sheltered nook, In heat the airy shade, And oft their casual home forsook The morrow it was made; Diverging many separate roads, They wandered, fancy-driven, Nor thought of other fixed abodes Than Paradise or Heaven. And while this holy sense remained, 'Mid easy shepherd cares, In tents they often entertained The Angels unawares: And to their spirits' fervid gaze The mystery was revealed, How the world's wound in future days Should by God's love be healed. Thus we, so late and far a link Of generation's chain, Delight to dwell in tents, and think The old world young again; With Faith as wide and Thought as narrow As theirs, who little more From life demanded than the sparrow Gay-chirping by the door. The Tent! how easily it stands, Almost as if it rose Spontaneous from the green or sand, Express for our repose: Or, rather, it is we who plant This root, where'er we roam, And hold, and can to others grant, The comforts of a home. Make the Divan—the carpets spread, The ready cushions pile; Rest, weary heart! rest, weary head! From pain and pride awhile: And all your happiest memories woo, And mingle with your dreams The yellow desert glimmering through The subtle veil of beams. We all have much we would forget— Be that forgotten now! And placid Hope, instead, shall set Her seal upon your brow: Imagination's prophet eye By her shall view unfurled The future greatnesses that lie Hid in the Eastern world. To slavish tyrannies their term Of terror she foretells; She brings to bloom the faith whose germ In Islam deeply dwells; Accomplishing each mighty birth That shall one day be born From marriage of the western earth With nations of the morn! Then fold the Tent—then on again; One spot of ashen black, The only sign that here has lain The traveller's recent track: And gladly forward, safe to find At noon and eve a home, Till we have left our Tent behind, The homeless ocean-foam! THE BURDEN OF EGYPT. Our land is the temple of the world, but Egypt will be forsaken, and the land which was once the seat of the divinity will be void of religion. Then this holy seat will be full of idolatry, idols' temples, and dead men's tombs. O Egypt! there will remain only a faint show of thy religion, not believed by posterity, and nought but the letters engraven on thy pillars will declare thy pious deeds. The divinity will fly to heaven, and Egypt will be forsaken by God and man. I call upon Thee, most holy River! I foretell unto Thee what will come to pass. Thy waters and holy streams will be filled with blood, and will overflow thy banks, so that the dead will be more numerous than the living; and he that remains alive will be known to be an Egyptian only by his language, but in his deeds he will seem a barbarian. Hermes Trismegistus. I After the phantasies of many a night, After the deep desires of many a day, Rejoicing as an ancient Eremite Upon the Desert's edge at last I lay: Before me rose, in wonderful array, Those works where man has rivalled Nature most, Those Pyramids, that fear no more decay Than waves inflict upon the rockiest coast, Or winds on mountain-steeps, and like endurance boast. II Fragments the deluge of old Time has left Behind it in its subsidence—long Walls Of cities of their very names bereft— Lone Columns, remnants of majestic halls,— Rich-traceried chambers, where the night-dew falls,— All have I seen with feelings due, I trow, Yet not with such as these memorials Of the great unremembered, that can show The mass and shape they wore four thousand years ago. I cannot here enter into chronological arguments, but I may mention that the schemes of Egyptian history, that give it the largest field of time, seem to me the most probable. III The screaming Arabs The noise of the Arabs is the greatest drawback to the pleasure of an excursion to the Pyramids—most disagreeable ciceroni besetting you on every side and in numbers that renders resistance impossible. left me there alone, Hoping small gain from one who silent dreamed; Till o'er the sand each solemn shadow thrown Like that of Etna to my fancy seemed, While in the minaretted distance gleamed Purple and faint-green relics of the day, And the warm air grew chill, and then I deemed I saw a Shape dark-lined against the gray Slowly approach my couch, but whence I could not say. IV The starry beauty of its earnest gaze The heavenly nature of that form revealed, Seen through the dimness of the evening haze, That magnified the figure it concealed: It was the Genius who has trust to wield The destinies of this our living hour, Who wills not that the studious heart should shield Itself from the requirements of his power, Or seek a selfish rest, whatever tempests lour. V Just at that moment, o'er the stony East An arch of crimson radiance caught my sight, That gradually expanded and increast, Till the large moon arose—and all was light! Then I beheld advancing opposite Another Shape, to which the Genius turned As with a look of anger and despite, While with a curious eagerness I burned, And marked the Shape as one that much my weal concerned. VI It was a female Form—divinely tall, Yet somewhat bowed, as by invisible weight, A face whose pallor almost might appal, Had not the charm of features been so great: Her gathered amice, like the web of fate, Was party-coloured, and her forehead bound With such gold-work as fairies fabricate In flowery cells, and stamp with letters round That mock the learned sage and foolish eyes astound. VII But passing by her without word or sign The first came straight to me and looked awhile, And laid his hand affectionately on mine, And veiled his sternness with a gentle smile: Making, by some unutterable wile, The homely duties I could hardly prize, And occupations I had left as vile, Rise to my conscience like domestic ties, For which my soul was bound all else to sacrifice. VIII “Thou that art born into this favoured age, So fertile in all enterprise of thought, Bound in fresh mental conflicts to engage The liberties for which your fathers fought,— Be not thy spirit contemplation-fraught, Musing and mourning! Thou must act and move, Must teach your children more than ye were taught, Brighten intelligence, disseminate love, And, through the world around, make way to worlds above. IX “The total surface of this sphered earth Is now surveyed by philosophic eyes; Nor East nor West conceals a secret worth— In the wide Ocean no Atlantis lies: Nations and men, that would be great and wise, Thou knowest, can do no more than men have done; No wondrous impulse, no divine surprise, Can bring this planet nearer to the sun,— Civilisation's prize no royal road has won. X “So not to distant people, to far times, Turn mind and heart, life's honest artisan! Seek not miraculous virtues, mighty crimes, Making a demon or a god of man: Deem not that ever, wide as mind can scan, He has been better in the mass than now, A thing of wider intellectual span, A creature of more elevated brow, A being Hope has right more richly to endow.” XI Thus in clear language, not without reproof, The Spirit of the Present, eagle-eyed, Conjured me not to lie in thought aloof From actual life, casting my fancy wide: I know not what my tongue confused replied; But she to whom my anxious looks appealed, Now seated near in tutelary pride, Spoke firmly for me, and would nowise yield A cause she felt at heart, and on so fair a field. XII She cried, “I am the Past!” and I inherit Some rights and powers that thou canst not dethrone, Therefore, unresting and untiring Spirit, Thou shalt not make the Poet all thine own: Time was when all men deemed that I alone Was chartered his bright presence to possess, That thou in heart and hand wert cold as stone, And he would perish in thy rude caress, Strong to insult and crush, but impotent to bless. XIII “But things are changed: over the Poet's soul No more my sway and dignities extend,— Thy influences now his moods control, If yet my lover, he is more thy friend: But, since his errant footsteps hither tend, Some little while by me he must remain, Some little while beneath my memories bend, And, when he hath full-stored his eager brain, He shall return and be thy servitor again. XIV “And surely here I claim but what I ought In this my holiest place, my special shrine, My Land of Egypt! where the human thought Is linked to Chaos and the light divine, Disparting darkness—led from line to line Of regal generations deep engraved, Or richly wrought in hieroglyphic sign, On Palaces, Tombs, Temples, that have saved Their beauty through such storms as rocks have hardly braved. XV “Here Fancy bows to Truth: Eldest of Time, Child of the world's fresh morning, Egypt saw These Pyramids rise gradually sublime, And eras pass, whose records, as with awe, Nature has willed from History to withdraw; Yet learn, that on these stones has Abraham gazed, These regions round acknowledged Joseph's law, That obelisk At Hieropolis. from granite bed was raised, Ere Moses in its shade sat and Jehovah praised. XVI “This Nile was populous with floating life For ages ere the Argo swept the seas, Ere Helen woke the fires of Grecian strife Thebes had beheld a hundred dynasties: And when the Poet, whom all grandeurs please, Named her the Hundred-gated That is, with the hundred temples: there was no wall round Thebes, therefore no gates; but the Pylones, or massive gates of the Temples, were evidently the object of foreign astonishment and admiration. and the Queen Of earthly cities, she had reached the lees Of her large cup of glory, and was seen Image and type of what her perfect pride had been. XVII “Here Greece, so often hailed progenitrix Of mortal wisdom, nurse of ancient lore, First skilled the ideal beautiful to fix In plastic forms that shall not perish more, Seems a pretender, who astutely bore O'er his young locks a show of reverent grey,— And Rome, whose greatness thou couldst once adore, Appears, with all her circumstance of sway, A mere familiar face, a thing of yesterday. XVIII “Thus recognise that here the Past is all, And Thou, the Present, nothing: no display Of intellectual vigour can appal Me, who can count the ages as a day: But lest thy subtle words should lead astray Him, who to me commits his heart awhile, Depart to thine own kingdoms far away; And we with grave delight will days beguile Of wintry name, but blest with summer's blandest smile.” XIX So were we left, the Past and I together; But how wise converse did itself unfold, And how we breathed in that delicious weather Whose balm was never hurt by heat or cold, And how the scrolls of Nature were uprolled Before me in that sacred company, Are what can never in such words be told As may seem worthy the reality: Faint are the shades I give of what was given to me. XX O Thou beneficent and bounteous stream! Thou Patriarch River! on whose ample breast We dwelt the time that full at once could seem Of busiest travel and of softest rest: No wonder that thy being was so blest That gratitude of old to worship grew, That as a living God Thou wert addrest, In the oldest form of Egyptian theology of which we have cognizance, the Nile is a God, and the phrase “the proper rising of the God,” is found on the tablet in front of the sphynx erected under Nero: the Egyptian theologians also imagined divisions in Heaven similar to those of earth, and could conceive no Paradise without a celestial Nile. And to itself the immediate agent drew To one creative power the feelings only due. XXI For in thy title and in Nature's truth Thou art and makest Egypt: The Egypt of Homer is the river not the country: all the other Greek names of Egypt are derived from the Nile: its Coptic name was Phiaro— hence probably Pharaoh. In somewhat the same sense is India derived from the Indus. were thy source But once arrested in its bubbling youth, Or turned extravagant to some new course, By a fierce crisis of convulsive force, Egypt would cease to be—the intrusive sand Would smother its rich fields without remorse, And scarce a solitary palm would stand To tell, that barren vale was once the wealthiest land. XXII Scarce with more certain order waves the Sun His matin banners in the Eastern sky, Than at the reckoned period are begun Thy operations of fertility; Through the long sweep thy bosom swelling high Expands between the sandy mountain chains, The walls of Libya and of Araby, Till in the active virtue it contains The desert bases sink and rise prolific plains. XXIII See through the naked length no blade of grass, No animate sign relieves the dismal strand, Such it might seem our orb's first substance was, Ere touched by God with generative hand; Yet at one step we reach the teeming land Lying fresh-green beneath the scorching sun, As succulent as if at its command It held all rains that fall, all brooks that run, And this, O generous Nile! is thy vast benison. XXIV Whence comest Thou, so marvellously dowered As never other stream on earth beside? Where are thy founts of being, thus empowered To form a nation by their annual tide? The charts are silent; history guesses wide; Adventure from thy quest returns ashamed; And each new age, in its especial pride, Believes that it shall be as that one named, In which to all mankind thy birth-place was proclaimed. XXV Though Priests upon thy banks, mysterious Water! Races of men in lofty knowledge schooled, Though warriors, winning fame through shock and slaughter, Sesostris to Napoleon, here have ruled: Yet has the secret of thy sources fooled The monarch's strength, the labours of the wise, And, though the world's desire has never cooled, Our practised vision little more descries Than old Herodotus beheld with simple eyes. In all probability the Nile has no one particular source, but is created by the convergence of many small streams, like the Thames and the Rhone. We have an excellent vindication for our geographical ignorance on this point in that of Pliny, with regard to the Rhine. Hundreds of years after the first passage of the river by Roman troops, he writes “that the Rhine takes its rise in the most hidden parts of the earth, in a region of perpetual night, amidst forests for ever inaccessible to human footsteps” (iii. 24). The source of the Iser seems, too, to have been equally undiscovered. XXVI And now in Egypt's late degraded day, A venerating love attends thee still, And the poor Fellah, from thee torn away, Feels a strange yearning his rude bosom fill; Like the remembered show of lake and hill, That wrings the Switzer's soul, though fortune smile, Thy mirage haunts him, uncontrolled by will, And wealth or war in vain the heart beguile That clings to its mud-hut and palms, beside the Nile. XXVII The Palm! the Princess of the Sylvan race; When islanded amid the level green, Or charming the wild desert with her grace, The only verdure of the sultry scene: Ever, with simple majesty of mien, No other growth of nature can assume, She reigns—and most when, in the evening sheen, The stable column and the waving plume Shade the delicious lights that all around allume. XXVIII Yet this fair family's most lofty peers Are dwarfed and stunted to the traveller's eye, When by them its enormous bulk uprears Some antique work of pomp or piety,— Columns that may in height and girth defy The sturdiest oaks that British glades adorn, Or chesnuts on the slopes of Sicily,— And walls that when, by time, to fragments torn, Still look like towering cliffs by mountain-torrents worn. XXIX 'Twould seem as if some people that had held Their pristine seat in lands of stony hill Once from their ancient boundaries outswelled, And took these vales to conquer and to till: So, where the memory and tradition still Of temples cut in living rocks remains, This one Idea the artists' breasts might fill, Who built amid the Nile's alluvial plains, First to erect the Rocks and then work out the Fanes. XXX Nor, when the architect's presiding thought Stood out in noble form, solid and clear, Was all the hieratic purpose wrought, Or sacred objects their completion near: For giant shapes of beauty and of fear Must make each part for open worship fit, And mystic language, known to priest and seer, In very volumes on the walls be writ, Whose sense is late revealed to searching modern wit. XXXI Within—without—no little space is lost, Though hardly obvious to a stranger eye; With lavish labour and uncounted cost Is overlaid each nook of masonry; No base too deep—no architrave too high For these weird records of a nation's lore, And early pride, that yearned to deify The names and titles that their monarchs bore— That what they loved and feared their children might adore. XXXII Thus the Eternal Trinities, The earlier Egyptians arranged their gods habitually in threes; when the theology got confused, the groups became more numerous and varied— just as new characters crept into the hieroglyphics and the titles of the Kings within the ovals became much longer. whose birth Is in the primal reason of mankind, Were mingled with the mighty of the earth, To whom was given the trust to loose and bind The destinies of nations: thus behind The God, came close the great victorious King; Till with the regal image were combined All the dim thoughts and phantasies that cling Round power, for power's own sake, as round a sacred thing. Throughout Egyptian history the King is divine; there were temples in front of the Pyramids, and the Labyrinth is the temple of another dynasty; so down to the latest and basest times. The most contemptible of the Ptolemies is on his coins—“the adorable God;” and Cleopatra, on her later ones—“the younger goddess.” XXXIII But walls, once stedfast as their base of rock, Have crumbled into heaps o'er which we climb, And graceless children leap from block to block, The spawn of Nature on the graves of Time: Into the tabernacle's night sublime, Through the long fissures curious sunrays peep; Say! if the Priests, who led this sacred mime, Could loose their spicy cerements and the sleep Of many thousand years,—say, would they smile or weep? XXXIV If that religion were a subtle wile Dominion over feeble minds to keep, If 'twere in truth a mime, they well might smile; But if 'twere truth itself, they well might weep; And why not truth itself? truth not less deep For being fragmentary,—though a gleam, Not less a portion of the fires that steep Mankind's brute matter in the heavenly stream, And lead to waking life through mazy modes of dream. XXXV Theirs was the sin to cumber faith with fear— To tremble where they should have feared and loved; To overlook the glory close and near, And only reverence it in space removed; Their pride of wisdom knew not it behoved Man's mind to worship but man's heart still more, Nor could conceive the doctrine thus approved, When far away from Egypt and its lore, Judæa's race, once free, the world's bright future bore. XXXVI For right to mediate between God and man The Art of Greece long combated in vain; Far earlier here was shown the heavenly plan How Nature's self could not that privilege gain; “The Egyptians thought it more worthy of the Gods to adore them in symbols animated by their creating breath, than in empty images of inert matter; they regarded the intelligence of animals as connecting them with Gods and men.”—Champollion. So now organic life can scarce obtain Its recognition of divinity,— Past like the godhead of the Grecian fane: And thus we know Ideas alone can be Idols divine enough for man's high destiny. XXXVII Who would not feel and satisfy this want, Watching, as I, in Karnak's roofless halls, Subnuvolar lights of evening sharply slant Through pillared masses and on wasted walls? Who would not learn, there is no form but palls On the progressive spirit of mankind, When here around in soulless sorrow falls That which seemed permanence itself, designed To rase the sense of death from out all human mind. XXXVIII For near the temple ever lies the tomb, The dwelling, not the dungeon, of the dead, Where they abide in glorifying gloom, In lofty chambers with rich colours spread, Vast corridors, all carved and decorated For entertainment of their ghostly lord, When he may leave his alabaster bed, And see, with pleasure earth could scarce afford, These subterranean walls his power and wealth record. XXXIX Often 'twas willed this splendour should be sealed Not only from profane but priestly eyes, That to no future gaze might be revealed The secret palace where a Pharaoh lies, Amid his world-enduring obsequies; And though we, children of a distant shore, Here search and scan, yet much our skill defies; One chance the less, some grains of sand the more, And never had been found that vault's mysterious door. e.g. that of Osiris I., discovered by a happy hazard by Belzoni, and from which the alabaster coffin was taken, now in Sir J. Soane's museum. The tombs of the Theban kings, as yet known, are confined to a single dynasty; there must be somewhere in the neighbourhood the sepultures of all the others, probably equal in magnificence and interest. XL Not without cause the Persian's brutal hate The regal corpse of Amasis profaned; The Arabs' greed would hardly venerate These halls of death, while hope of gain remained: So much for ages with base passions stained; But who are now the spoilers? We, even we; Now the worst fiends of ruin are unchained, That sons of science and civility May bear the fragments home, beyond the midland sea. “I have travelled through Greece, Egypt, Nubia, and much of Asia Minor, and I have witnessed much destruction of monuments; but everywhere the injurers were Europeans, the pretext science, and the motive gain.”—Prokesch. XLI Soon will these miracles of eldest art Be but as quarries hollowed in base stone; Unless the Pasha will have doors erected and watched, and all pillage forbidden, under heavy penalties; the figures are now being stripped from the walls every day. Soon will the tablets, that might bear their part In shedding light on tracts of time unknown Be by caprice or avarice overthrown; While worn by bitter frost of northern gloom The obelisks will stand defaced and lone, That of Luxor, at Paris, has already lost the sharpness of the edges. And god-like effigies, that had for room The Nile and Desert, pine in narrow prison-gloom. XLII But from that Theban Kingdom desolate Benevolent winds, opposing the swift tide, Impelled me onward, nor did once abate Till the strong Cataract checked my vessel's pride: How happy in that cool bright air to glide By Esne, Edfou, Ombos! each in turn A pleasure, and to other joys a guide;— Labourless motion—yet enough to earn Syene's roseate cliffs In the quarries of red granite at Syene may be seen the marks of the tools employed a thousand years ago, as fresh as if they had been left yesterday, and the form of an obelisk may be traced, partially dissevered from its native rock.—Egypt's romantic bourn. XLIII Tranquil above the rapids, rocks, and shoals, The Tivoli of Egypt, Philæ lies; No more the frontier-fortress that controls The rush of Ethiopian enemies,— No more the Isle of Temples to surprise, With Hierophantic courts and porticoes, The simple stranger, but a scene where vies Dead Art with living Nature to compose For that my pilgrimage a fit and happy close. XLIV There I could taste without distress of thought The placid splendours of a Nubian night, The sky with beautiful devices fraught Of suns and moons and spaces of white light: While on huge gateways rose the forms of Might, Awful as when the People's heart they swayed, And the grotesque grew solemn to my sight; And earnest faces thronged the colonnade, As if they wailed a faith forgotten or betrayed. XLV There too, in calmer mood, I sent aflight My mind through realms of marvel stretching far, O'er Abyssinian Alps of fabled height, O'er Deserts where no paths or guidance are, Save when, by pilotage of some bright star, As on the ocean, wends the caravan; Canopus, the ornament of the Southern hemisphere, is called by the Arabs, “the caravan-seducer”— a large caravan having been lost in the desert by the driver taking it for Venus. And then I almost mourned the mythic bar That in old times along that frontier ran, When gods came down to feast with Ethiopian man. XLVI For I remember races numberless, Whom still those latitudes in mystery fold, And asked, what does the Past, my monitress, For them within her genial bosom hold? Where is for them the tale of history told? How is their world advancing on its way? How are they wiser, better, or more bold, That they were not created yesterday? Why are we life-taught men, why poor ephemerals they? XLVII Present and Past are question'd there in vain, And hang their heads unanswering: there in fee The Future holds her absolute domain, Empress of what a third of Earth shall be: But will our generations live to see Plenty through those unwatered regions reign,— Science there dwell as with the white and free,— To gentle thoughts subside the heated brain,— And lawless tribes be bound in Order's sacred chain: XLVIII May such things be? Ask him who hopes and prays Rather than reasons. Good men have not quailed Before the problem. and high justice weighs The thoughts that prompted, not the deeds that failed. What matter that the world has mocked and railed? What matter that they perish, work undone? The prescience of such souls has ever hailed, Long ere the dawn, the coming of the sun, And, may be, by such Faith the Light itself is won. A TRAVELLER'S IMPRESSION ON THE NILE. When you have lain for weeks together On such a noble river's breast, And learnt its face in every weather, And loved its motions and its rest,— 'Tis hard at some appointed place To check your course and turn your prow, And objects for themselves retrace You past with added hope just now. The silent highway forward beckons, And all the bars that reason plants Now disappointed fancy reckons As foolish fears or selfish wants. The very rapids, rocks, and shoals Seem but temptations which the stream Holds out to energetic souls, That worthy of its love may seem. But life is full of limits; heed not One more or less—the forward track May often give you what you need not, While wisdom waits on turning back. OTHER SCENES. THE RIVER TRAUN. WRITTEN IN LOMBARDY. The Traun rises in the mountains of Upper Austria, and loses itself in the Danube above Linz. Its course is remarkable for the combination of the best features of Alpine scenery with the grace and elegance of the Southern landscape. My heart is in a mountain mood, Though I am bound to tread the plain, She will away for ill or good,— I cannot lure her back again; So let her go,—God speed her flight O'er teeming glebe and columned town, I know that she will rest ere night, By the remembered banks of Traun. And she will pray her sister Muse, Sister, companion, friend, and guide, Her every art and grace to use, For love of that well-cherished tide; But words are weak,—she cannot reach By such poor steps that Beauty's crown; How can the Muse to others teach What were to me the banks of Traun? She can repeat the faithful tale That “where thy genial waters flow, All objects the rare crystal hail, And cast their voices far below; And there the stedfast echoes rest, Till the old Sun himself goes down, Till darkness falls on every breast, Even on thine, transparent Traun!” And she can say, “Where'er thou art, Brawling 'mid rocks, or calm-embayed, Outpouring thy abundant heart In ample lake or deep cascade,— Whatever dress thy sides adorn, Fresh-dewy leaves or fir-stems brown, Or ruby-dripping barbery thorn, Thou art thyself, delightful Traun! “No glacier-mountains, harshly bold, Whose peaks disturb the summer air, And make the gentle blue so cold, And hurt our warmest thoughts, are there; But upland meadows, lush with rills, Soft-green as is the love-bird's down, And quaintest forms of pine-clad hills, Are thy fit setting, jewelled Traun!” But the wise Muse need not be told, Though fair and just her song may seem, The same has oft been sung of old, Of many a less deserving stream; For where would be the worth of sight, If Love could feed on blank renown? They who have loved the Traun aright Have sat beside the banks of Traun. TO AN ENGLISH LADY, WHO HAD SUNG A ROMAN BALLAD. Blame not my vacant looks; it is not true, That my discourteous thoughts did vainly stray Out of the presence of your gentle lay, While other eager listeners nearer drew, Though sooth I hardly heard a note; for you, Most cunning songstress, did my soul convey Over the fields of space, far, far away, To the dear garden-land, where long it grew. Thus, all that time, beneath the ilex roof Of an old Alban hill, I lay aloof, With the cicala faintly clittering near, Till, as your song expired, the clouds that pass Athwart the Roman plain, as o'er a glass, Thickened, and bade the vision disappear. ON THE CHURCH OF THE MADELEINE AT PARIS. I. The Attic temple whose majestic room Contained the presence of Olympian Jove, With smooth Hymettus round it and above, Softening the splendour by a sober bloom, Is yielding fast to Time's irreverent doom; While on the then barbarian banks of Seine That nobler type is realised again In perfect form, and dedicate—to whom? To a poor Syrian girl, of lowliest name, A hapless creature, pitiful and frail As ever wore her life in sin and shame,— Of whom all history has this single tale,— “She loved the Christ, she wept beside his grave, And He, for that Love's sake, all else forgave.” II. If one, with prescient soul to understand The working of this world beyond the day Of his small life, had taken by the hand That wanton daughter of old Magdala; And told her that the time was ripe to come When she, thus base among the base, should be More served than all the Gods of Greece and Rome, More honoured in her holy memory,— How would not men have mocked and she have scorned The fond Diviner?—Plausible excuse Had been for them, all moulded to one use Of feeling and of thought, but We are warned By such ensamples to distrust the sense Of Custom proud and bold Experience. III. Thanks to that element of heavenly things, That did come down to earth, and there confound Most sacred thoughts with names of usual sound, And homeliest life with all a Poet sings. The proud Ideas that had ruled and bound Our moral nature were no longer kings, Old Power grew faint and shed his eagle-wings, And grey Philosophy was half uncrowned. Love, Pleasure's child, betrothed himself to Pain;— Weakness, and Poverty, and Self-disdain, And tranquil sufferance of repeated wrongs, Became adorable;—Fame gave her tongues, And Faith her hearts to objects all as low As this lorn child of infamy and woe. ON REVISITING CAMBRIDGE, AFTER A LONG ABSENCE ON THE CONTINENT. Nor few, nor poor in beauty, my resorts In foreign climes,—nor negligent or dull My observation, but these long-left courts I still find beautiful, most beautiful! And fairly are they more so than before; For to my eye, fresh from a southern land, They wear the colouring of the scenes of yore, And the old Faith that made them here to stand. I paint the very students as they were, Not the men-children of these forward days, But mild-eyed boys just risen from their knees, While, proud as angels of their holy care, Following the symbol-vested priest, they raise The full response of antique litanies. THE SAME. I have a debt of my heart's own to Thee, School of my Soul! old lime and cloister shade, Which I, strange suitor, should lament to see Fully acquitted and exactly paid: The first ripe taste of manhood's best delights, Knowledge imbibed, while mind and heart agree, In sweet belated talk on winter nights, With friends whom growing time keeps dear to me,— Such things I owe thee, and not only these: I owe thee the far beaconing memories Of the young dead, who, having crossed the tide Of Life where it was narrow, deep, and clear, Now cast their brightness from the further side On the dark-flowing hours I breast in fear. ON COWPER'S GARDEN AT OLNEY. From this forlornest place, at morn and even, Issues a voice imperative, “Begone, All ye that let your vermin thoughts creep on Beneath the unheeded thunders of high Heaven; Nor welcome they, who, when free grace is given To free from usual life's dominion, Soon as the moving scene or time is gone, Return, like penitents unfitly shriven. But Ye, who long have wooed the memory Of this great Victim of sublime despair, Encompassed round with evil as with air, Yet crying, ‘God is good, and sinful He,’—. Remain, and feel how better 'tis to drink Of Truth to Madness even than shun that fountain's brink.” ON MILTON'S COTTAGE, AT CHALFONT ST. GILES, WHERE HE REMAINED DURING THE GREAT PLAGUE. Beneath this roof, for no such use designed By its old owners, Fleetwood's banished race, Blind Milton found a healthful resting-place, Leaving the city's dark disease behind:— Here, too, with studies noble and refined, As with fresh air, his spirits he could brace, And grow unconscious of the time's disgrace, And the fierce plague of disappointed mind. The gracious Muse is wont to build for most Of her dear sons some pleasant noontide bower; But for this One she raised a home of fame, Where he dwelt safe through life's chill evening hour, Above the memo'ry of his Hero lost, His martyred brethren and his country's shame. ANSWER TO WORDSWORTH'S SONNET AGAINST THE KENDAL AND BOWNESS RAILWAY. The hour may come, nay must in these our days, When the swift steam-car with the cata'ract's shout Shall mingle its harsh roll, and motley rout Of multitudes these mountain echoes raise. But Thou, the Patriarch of these beauteous ways, Canst never grudge that gloomy streets send out The crowded sons of labour, care, and doubt, To read these scenes by light of thine own lays. Disordered laughter and encounters rude The Poet's finer sense perchance may pain, But many a glade and nook of solitude For quiet walk and thought will still remain, Where He those poor intruders can elude, Nor lose one dream for all their homely gain. TINTERN ABBEY. The Men who called their passion piety, And wrecked this noble argosy of faith,— They little thought how beauteous could be Death, How fair the face of Time's aye deepe'ning sea! Nor arms that desolate, nor years that flee, Nor hearts that fail, can utterly deflower This grassy floor of sacramental power Where we now stand commu'nicants—even We, We of this latter, still protéstant age, With priestly ministrations of the Sun And Moon and multitudinous quire of stars Maintain this consecration, and assuage With tender thoughts the past of weary wars, Masking with good that ill which cannot be undone. ON THE GRAVE OF BISHOP KEN, AT FROME, IN SOMERSETSHIRE. Let other thoughts, where'er I roam, Ne'er from my memory cancel The coffin-fashioned tomb at Frome That lies behind the chancel; A basket-work where bars are bent, Iron in place of osier, And shapes above that represent A mitre and a crosier. These signs of him that slumbers there The dignity betoken; These iron bars a heart declare Hard bent but never broken; This form pourtrays how souls like his, Their pride and passion quelling, Preferr'd to earth's high palaces This calm and narrow dwelling. There with the church-yard's common dust He loved his own to mingle; The faith in which he placed his trust Was nothing rare or single; Yet laid he to the sacred wall As close as he was able, The blessèd crumbs might almost fall Upon him from God's table. Who was this Father of the Church, So secret in his glory? In vain might antiquarians search For record of his story; But preciously tradition keeps The fame of holy men; So there the Christian smiles or weeps For love of Bishop Ken. A name his country once forsook, But now with joy inherits, Confessor in the Church's book, And Martyr in the Spirit's! That dared with royal power to cope, In peaceful faith persisting, A braver Becket—who could hope To conquer unresisting! OCCASIONAL POEMS. THE FUNERAL OF NAPOLEON. All nature is stiff in the chill of the air, The sun looks around with a smile of despair; 'Tis a day of delusion, of glitter and gloom, As brilliant as glory, as cold as the tomb. The pageant is passing—the multitude sways— Awaiting, pursuing, the line with its gaze, With the tramp of battalion, the tremor of drums, And the grave exultation of trumpets he comes. It passes! what passes? He comes! who is He? Is it Joy too profound to be uttered in glee? Oh, no! it is Death, the Dethroner of old, Now folded in purple and girded with gold! It is Death, who enjoys the magnificent car, It is Death, whom the warriors have brought from afar, It is Death, to whom thousands have knelt on the shore, And sainted the bark and the treasure it bore. What other than He, in his terrible calm, Could mingle for myriads the bitter and balm, Could hush into silence this ocean of men, And bid the wild passion be still in its den? What other than He could have placed side by side The chief and the humblest, that serving him died, Could the blood of the past to the mourner atone, And let all bless the name that has orphaned their own? From the shades of the olive, the palm, and the pine, From the banks of the Moskwa, the Nile, and the Rhine, From the sands and the glaciers, in armament dim, Come they who have perished for France and for Him. Rejoice, ye sad Mothers, whose desolate years Have been traced in the desert of earth by their tears, The Children for whom ye have hearts that still burn, In this triumph of Death—it is they that return. And Ye in whose breast dwell the images true Of parents that loved Him still better than you, No longer lament o'er a cenotaph urn, In this triumph of Death—it is they that return. From legion to legion the watchword is sped— “Long life to the Emperor—life to the dead!” The prayer is accomplished—his ashes remain 'Mid the people he loved, on the banks of the Seine. In dominions of Thought that no traitor can reach, Through the kingdoms of Fancy, the regions of Speech, O'er the world of Emotions, Napoleon shall reign 'Mid the people he loved, on the banks of the Seine. Paris, December, 1840. IRELAND, 1847. The woes of Ireland are too deep for verse: The Muse has many sorrows of her own; Griefs she may well to sympathy rehearse, Pains she may soften by her gentle tone. But the stark death in hunger and sharp cold, The slow exhaustion of our mortal clay, Are not for her to touch.—She can but fold Her mantle o'er her head, and weep and pray. O gracious Ruler of the rolling hours! Let not this agony last over long; Restore a nation to its manly powers, Give back its suffe'rings to the sphere of Song. A MONUMENT FOR SCUTARI, AFTER THE CRIMEAN WAR, SEPTEMBER, 1855. “The cypresses of Scutari In stern magnificence look down On the bright lake and stream of sea And glittering theatre of town; Above the throng of rich kiosks, Above the towers in triple tire, Above the domes of loftiest mosques, Those pinnacles of death aspire.” Thus, years ago, in grave descant, The trave'ller sang those ancient trees That Eastern grace delights to plant In reverence of man's obsequies; But time has shed a golden haze Of memory round the cypress glooms, And gladly he reviews the days He wandered 'mid those alien tombs. Now other passion rules the soul; And Scutari's familiar name Arouses thoughts beyond controul, A tangled web of pride and shame; No more shall that fair word recall The Moslem and his Asian rest, But the dear brothers of us all Rent from their mother's bleeding breast. Calmly our warriors moulder there, Uncoffined, in the sandy soil, Once festered in the sultry glare, Or wasted in the wintry toil. No verdure on those graves is seen, No shade obstructs the garish day; The tender dews to keep them green Are wept, alas! too far away; Are wept in homes their smiles shall bless No more, beyond the welte'ring deep, In cottages now fatherless On English mead or Highland steep, In palaces by common grief Made level with the meanest room,— One agony, and one relief— The conscience of a glorious doom! For there, too, is Thermopylæ;— As on the dank Ægean shore, By this bright portal of the sea Stood the Devoted as of yore; When Greece herself was merged in night, The Spartan held his honour's meed— And shall no pharos shed the light To future time of Britain's deed? Masters of Form!—if such be now— On sense and powers of Art intent, To match this mount of sorrow's brow Devise your seemliest monument: One that will symbolize the cause For which this might of manhood fell, Obedience to their country's laws, And duty to God's truth as well. Let, too, the old Miltonic Muse, That trumpeted “the scattered bones Of saints on Alpine mountains,” use Reveillé of forgotten tones; Let some one, worthy to be priest Of this high altar of renown, Write in the tongues of West and East Who bore this cross, who wore this crown. Write that, as Britain's peaceful sons Luxurious rich, well-tended poor, Fronted the foeman's steel and guns, As each would guard his household door; So, in those ghastly halls of pain Where thousand hero-sufferers lay, Some smiled in thought to fight again, And most unmurmu'ring passed away. Write that, when pride of human skill Fell prostrate with the weight of care, And men prayed out for some strong will, Some reason 'mid the wild despair, The loving heart of woman rose To guide the hand and clear the eye, Gave hope amid the sternest woes, And saved what man had left to die. Florence Nightingale. Write every name—lowlier the birth, Loftier the death!—and trust that when On this regenerated earth Rise races of ennobled men, They will remember—these were they Who strove to make the nations free, Not only from the sword's brute sway, But from the spirit's slavery. ON THE PEACE May, 1856. Come in, wild Hopes! that towards the dawning East Uprose so high: now be content to stand, Like hooded hawks upon the falconer's hand, Awhile expectant of the promised feast. Peace is proclaimed! the captives are releast! Yet yearns the exile from the alien strand,— Yet chafes and struggles Europe's fairest land,— Untamed by priestly kings or kingly priest. O blessed Peace! if peace were peace indeed,— Based upon justice and the eternal laws Which make the free intent of Man the cause Of all enduring thought and virtuous deed. But 'tis not so: we know we do but pause, Awaiting fiercer strife and nobler meed. CRIMEAN INVALID SOLDIERS REAPING AT ALDERSHOT. Reap ye the ripe ripe corn, Ye have reap'd the green and the young, The fruits that were scarcely born,— The fibres that just were strung. Ye have reaped, as the Destinies reap, The wit and the worth of Man, The tears that we vainly weep— The deeds that we vainly plan. Now reap as the generous life Of the pregnant Earth commands, Each seed with a future rife, And the work of a thousand hands. Beautifully illustrated by Mr. Walter Severn. COLUMBUS AND THE MAY-FLOWER. Written as prefatory stanzas to Hunter's “Collection concerning the Founders of New Plymouth.” O little fleet! that on thy quest divine Sailedst from Palos one bright autumn morn, Say, has old Ocean's bosom ever borne A freight of Faith and Hope to match with thine? Say, too, has Heaven's high favour given again Such consummation of desire, as shone About Columbus, when he rested on The new-found world and married it to Spain? Answer—Thou refuge of the Freeman's need,— Thou for whose destinies no kings looked out, Nor sages to resolve some mighty doubt,— Thou simple May-Flower of the salt-sea mead! When Thou wert wafted to that distant shore— Gay flowers, bright birds, rich odours, met thee not: Stern Nature hail'd thee to a sterner lot.— God gave free earth and air, and gave no more. Thus to men cast in that heroic mould Came Empire such as Spaniard never knew— Such Empire as beseems the just and true; And at the last, almost unsought, came Gold. But He who rules both calm and stormy days Can guard that people's heart, that nation's health, Safe on the perilo'us heights of power and wealth, As in the straitness of the ancient ways. CHINA, 1857. The little Athens from its pillared hill Yet reigns o'er spacious tracts of human mind: Britain, within her narrow bounds confined, Bends East and West to her sagacious will: While, recordless alike for good or ill, China extends her name o'er so much rind Of the round earth, and only stunts mankind To mean desires, low acts, and puny skill. Enormous masses of monotonous life! Teaching how weak is mere material power To roll our world toward its heavenly goal: Teaching how vain is each exhausted hour That does not mingle in the mental strife, That does not raise or purify the soul. AN ENVOY TO AN AMERICAN LADY. Beyond the vague Atlantic deep, Far as the farthest prairies sweep, Where forest-glooms the nerve appal, Where burns the radiant Western fall, One duty lies on old and young,— With filial piety to guard, As on its greenest native sward, The glory of the English tongue. That ample speech! That subtle speech! Apt for the need of all and each: Strong to endure, yet prompt to bend Wherever human feelings tend. Preserve its force—expand its powers; And through the maze of civic life, In Letters, Commerce, even in Strife, Forget not it is yours and ours. ENGLAND AND AMERICA, 1863. We only know that in the sultry weather, Men toiled for us as in the steaming room, And in our minds we hardly set together The bondman's penance and the freeman's loom. We never thought the jealous gods would store For us ill deeds of time-forgotten graves, Nor heeded that the May-Flower one day bore A freight of pilgrims, and another slaves. First on the bold upholders of the wrong, And last on us, the heavy-laden years Avenge the cruel triumphs of the strong— Trampled affections, and derided tears. Labour, degraded from her high behest, Cries “Ye shall know I am the living breath, And not the curse of Man. Ye shall have Rest— The rest of Famine and the rest of Death.” Oh, happy distant hours! that shall restore Honour to work, and pleasure to repose, Hasten your steps, just heard above the roar Of wildering passions and the crash of foes. ON THE OPENING OF THE FIRST PUBLIC PLEASURE-GROUND AT BIRMINGHAM August, 1856. I Soldiers of Industry! come forth: Knights of the Iron Hand! Past is the menace of the North That frowned upon our land. We have no will to count the cost, No thought of what we bore Now the last warrior's gaze has lost The doomed Crimean shore! II That shore, so precious in the graves Of those whose lustrous deeds Consecrate Balaklava's waves, And Alma's flowe'ring reeds; Where, at some future festival, Our Russian foe will tell, How British wrestlers, every fall, Rose stronger than they fell. III Now town and hamlet cheer to see Each bronzed and bearded man, Or murmur low, “'Twas such as he, Who died at the Redan!” Rest for his worn or crippled frame, Rest for his anxious eye,— Rest, even from the noise of Fame, A Nation's welcome-cry! IV But Ye,—whose resolute intents And sturdy arms combine To bend the' obdurate elements Of Earth to Man's design— Ye, to your hot and constant task Heroically true, Soldiers of Industry! we ask, “Is there no Peace for you?” V It may not be: the' unpausing march Of toil must still be yours— Conquest, with no triumphant arch, Unsung by Troubadours: Yet, as the fiercest Knights of old To give “God's Truce” agreed, Cry ye, who are as brave and bold, “God's Truce” in Labour's need. VI “God's Truce” be their device, who meet To-day with generous zeal To work, by many a graceful feat, Their brethren's future weal; From stifling street and popu'lous mart To guard this ample room, For honest pleasures kept apart, And deck'd with green and bloom. VII Here let the eye to toil minute Condemned, with joy behold The fresh enchantment of each suit That clothes the common mould: Here let the arm whose skilful force Controuls such mighty powers, Direct the infant's totte'ring course Amid the fragrant bowers. VIII Yet all in vain this happy hope, In vain this friendly care, Unless of loftier life the scope In every mind be there: In vain the fairest, brightest, scene, If passion's sensual haze And clouded spirits lie between To mar the moral gaze. IX He only at the marriage-feast Of Nature and of God Sits worthily who sits released From sin's and sorrow's load: And then, on his poor window-sill, One flower more pleasure brings Than all the gorgeous plants that fill The restless halls of kings. X All Nature answers in the tone In which she is addressed: Beneath Mont Blanc's illumined throne, The peasant walks unblessed; The' Italian struggles in his bonds, Beside his glorious sea, And Beauty from all sight absconds Which is not wise and free. XI So, Friends! while gentle Arts are wed To frame your perfect plan, Broadcast be Truth and Knowledge spread O'er this rich soil of Man! Ideal parks—ideal shade— Lay out with libe'ral hand— But teach the souls you strive to aid To feel and understand. WORKMAN'S CHORAL SONG. SUNG AT THE OPENING OF THE DUTCH INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, AT AMSTERDAM, JULY 15, 1869. (Paraphrased from the Dutch.) No monster of Iron on gunpowder fed, No clangor of Steel, no whizzing of Lead, Make the blood in our arteries tingle; But the whirl of the wheel, and the whistle of steam, And the bubbling hiss of the seething stream, Are the sounds where our sympathies mingle. No Laurel that drips with the blood of the brave, No crown that hangs over the conqueror's grave, No wreath that is woven in weeping— The Olive that circles the forehead of toil, The meed of the master of metal and soil, Is the fruit that we glory in reaping. Oh! the roar and the foam of the fiery stream! Oh! the rush and the shriek of the bursting steam! No warrior's clarion is louder; We, too, have our iron, our steel, and our lead, But ours is living and theirs is dead, And the music of Peace is the prouder. Then a Song shall arise in melodious might, To God who has severed the Dark from the Light, And the Work and the Workman created; By the play of the muscles He holds us in health, By the sweat of the brow can endow us with wealth, In the love of our labour elated. We sow for the weal of the loved ones at home, We know in good time that the harvest will come,— He wins who has honestly striven: Our toil is the salt of the bread of to-day, And the food of our hearts is the Faith that can say, “We, too, have our Rest and our Heaven.” ON THE OPENING OF THE ALBERT HALL South Kensington, May 1, 1871. Set to very effective music by the Cavaliere Ciro Pinsuti, and sung by a full choir. O people of this favoured land Within this peaceful Orbit met, We strike the chords with trembling hand, The voice within us falters yet: While on this point of time we stand, Shall we remember or forget? We must remember those good days When first we bade the Nations fill The fairy Halls we dared to raise, By Genius wed to earnest Will,— And all was pleasure, power, and praise, The fair reward of toil and skill. So let this gracious memory veil From present thoughts the later woe, Now that the blood-red clouds grow pale, Now that no more the trumpets blow,— No more beneath the fiery hail Children in terror come and go. Be this a feast of Hope! the flowers Of Spring the waste of War repair: The quiet work of happier hours Dispels the load of human care: For Industry and Art are Powers That know no End and no Despair. IN MEMORIAM. LADY CAMPBELL. Gently supported by the ready aid Of loving hands, whose little work of toil Her grateful prodigality repaid With all the benediction of her smile, She turned her failing feet To the soft-pillowed seat, Dispensing kindly greetings all the while. Before the tranquil beauty of her face I bowed in spirit, thinking that she were A suff'ring Angel, whom the special grace Of God entrusted to our pious care, That we might learn from her The art to minister To heavenly beings in seraphic air. There seemed to lie a weight upon her brain, That ever pressed her blue-veined eyelids down, But could not dim her lustrous eyes with pain, Nor seam her forehead with the faintest frown: She was as she were proud, So young, to be allowed To follow Him who wore the thorny crown. Nor was she sad, but over every mood, To which her lightly-pliant mind gave birth, Gracefully changing, did a spirit brood, Of quiet gaiety, and serenest mirth; And thus her voice did flow, So beautifully low, A stream whose music was no thing of earth. Now long that instrument has ceased to sound, Now long that gracious form in earth has lain Tended by nature only, and unwound Are all those mingled threads of Love and Pain; So let me weep and bend My head and wait the end, Knowing that God creates not thus in vain. GEORGE VERNON COLEBROKE. Thou too art gone, and yet I hardly know Why thou didst care to go: Thou wert so well at heart, so spirit-clear, So heavenly-calm, though here; But thus it is; and, it would seem, no more Can we, who on the shore Of the loud world still walk, escape the din, And lie awhile within The quiet sunlight of thy filmless mind And rise refreshed, refined; Yet am I mild and tempered in my grief, Having a sure relief;— For these dear hours on life's dull length were sprent, By rarest accident, And now I have thee by me when I will, Hear thy wise words, and fill My soul with thy calm looks; now I can tame Ill thoughts by thy mere name. Death, the Divorcer, has united us With bands impervious To any tooth of Time, for they are wove Of the same texture as an Angel's Love. February 23, 1835. ARTHUR AND HELEN HALLAM. A Brother and a Sister,—these two Friends, Cast by fond Nature in one common mould, And waited on by genial circumstance In all their history of familiar love, After a parting of not quite four years, Are peacefully united here once more. He first, as best beseemed the manly mind, Tried the dark wall, which has (or seems to have) No portion in the pleasant sun or stars, The breath of flowers or morning-song of birds, The hand of Friendship or the lips of Love. Whether her sad and separated soul Received some token from that secret place, That she might follow him and meet him there, Or whether God, displeased that anything Of good or evil should so long divide Such undefiled and sacred sympathies, Has made them one again before his face, Are things that we perhaps shall never know. Say not, O world of short and broken sight! That these died young: the bee and butterfly Live longer in one active sunny hour Than the poor tortoise in his torpid years: The lofty flights of Thought through clear and cloud— The labyrinthine ways that Poesy Leads her beloved, the weary traverses Of Reason, and the haven of calm Faith, All had been theirs; their seamless brows had known The seal of pain, the sacrament of tears; And, unless Pride and Passion and bold Sin Are all the rule and reckoning of our Being, They have fulfilled as large a task of life As ever veteran on the mortal field. Thus they who gave these favoured creatures birth Deem it no hard infraction of the law Which regulates the order of our race, That they above their offspring raise the tomb, And with parental piety discharge The duties filial love delights to pay: They read the perfect sense of the design In that which seems exception, and they mourn, Not that these dear ones are already gone, But that they linger still so far behind. MRS. DENISON. Mrs. Denison was the first wife of the Bishop of Salisbury, and is buried in a grassy space enclosed by the cloisters of that cathedral. 'Tis right for her to sleep between Some of those old Cathedral-walls, And right too that her grave is green With all the dew and rain that falls. 'Tis well the organ's solemn sighs Should soar and sink around her rest, And almost in her ear should rise The prayers of those she loved the best. 'Tis also well this air is stirred By Nature's voices loud and low, By thunder and the chirping bird, And grasses whispering as they grow. For all her spirit's earthly course Was as a lesson and a sign How to o'errule the hard divorce That parts things natural and divine. Undaunted by the clouds of fear, Undazzled by a happy day, She made a Heaven about her here, And took, how much! with her away. Salisbury, November, 1843. MARY AND AGNES BERRY. Nov. 27, 1852. Two friends within one grave we place United in our tears,— Sisters, scarce parted for the space Of more than eighty years; And she whose bier is borne to-day, The one the last to go, Bears with her thoughts that force their way Above the moment's woe; Thoughts of the varied human life Spread o'er that field of time— The toil, the passion, and the strife, The virtue and the crime. Yet 'mid this long tumultuous scene, The image on our mind Of these dear women rests serene In happy bounds confined. Within one undisturbed abode Their presence seems to dwell, From which continual pleasures flowed, And countless graces fell; Not unbecoming this our age Of decorative forms, Yet simple as the hermitage Exposed to Nature's storms. Our English grandeur on the shelf Deposed its decent gloom, And every pride unloosed itself Within that modest room; Where none were sad, and few were dull, And each one said his best, And beauty was most beautiful With vanity at rest. Brightly the day's discourse rolled on, Still casting on the shore Memorial pearls of days bygone, And worthies now no more; And little tales of long ago Took meaning from those lips, Wise chroniclers of joy and woe, And eyes without eclipse. No taunt or scoff obscured the wit That there rejoiced to reign; They never could have laughed at it If it had carried pain. There needless scandal, e'en though true, Provoked no bitter smile, And even men-of-fashion grew Benignant for a while. Not that there lacked the nervous scorn At every public wrong, Not that a friend was left forlorn When victim of the strong: Free words, expressing generous blood, No nice punctilio weighed, For deep and earnest womanhood Their reason underlaid. As generations onward came, They loved from all to win Revival of the sacred flame That glowed their hearts within. While others in Time's greedy mesh The faded garlands flung, Their hearts went out and gathered fresh Affections from the young. Farewell, dear ladies! in your loss We feel the past recede, The gap our hands could almost cross Is now a gulf indeed: Ye, and the days in which your claims And charms were early known, Lose substance, and ye stand as names That History makes its own. Farewell! the pleasant social page Is read, but ye remain Examples of ennobled age, Long life without a stain; A lesson to be scorned by none, Least by the wise and brave, Delightful as the winter sun That gilds this open grave. DRYDEN AND THACKERAY. (HISTORICAL CONTRAST.) When one whose nervous English verse, Public and party hates defied, Who bore and bandied many a curse Of angry times—when Dryden died, Our royal Abbey's Bishop-Dean Dr. Sprat, Bishop of Rochester and Dean of Westminster. Waited for no suggestive prayer, But, ere one day closed o'er the scene, Craved as a boon to lay him there. The wayward faith, the faulty life, Vanished before a nation's pain; “Panther” and “Hind” forgot their strife, And rival statesmen thronged the fane. O gentle Censor of our age! Prime master of our ampler tongue! Whose word of wit and generous page Were never wroth except with wrong,— Fielding—without the manners' dross, Scott—with a spirit's larger room, What prelate deems thy grave his loss? What Halifax erects thy tomb? The Lord Halifax sent to the Lady Elizabeth and Mr. Charles Dryden her son, that if they would give him leave to bury Mr. Dryden, he would inter him with a gentleman's private funeral, and afterwards bestow five hundred pounds on a monument in the Abbey: which, as they had no reason to refuse, they accepted.—Biog. Dict. But, may be, He who so could draw The hidden great, the humble wise, Yielding with them to God's good law, Makes the Pantheon where he lies. A bust of Thackeray has now been placed in Westminster Abbey by public subscription, and with the sanction of Dean Stanley. THE DEATH OF LIVINGSTONE. (ILALA—MAY, 1873.) The swarthy followers stood aloof, Unled—unfathered; He lay beneath that grassy roof Fresh-gathered. He bade them, as they passed the hut, To give no warning Of their still faithful presence but “Good Morning.” To him, may be, through broken sleep And pains abated, These words were into senses deep Translated. Dear dead salutes of wife and child, Old kirkyard greetings; Sunrises over hill-sides wild, Heart-beatings; Welcoming sounds of fresh-blown seas, Of homeward travel, Tangles of thought last memories Unravel. 'Neath England's fretted roof of fame— With flowers adorning An open grave—comes up the same “Good Morning.” Morning o'er that weird continent Now slowly breaking— Europe her sullen self-restraint Forsaking! Morning of sympathy and trust For such as bore Their Master's spirit's sacred crust To England's shore. GHAZELES. I. Sister! I will go with Thee; How can I not go with Thee? What am I for, but to share Thought, and joy, and woe with Thee? I have known the unstainèd peace Children only know—with Thee; I have watched the chequered blooms Of my fortune blow—with Thee; I must part the scanty hope Our low fates bestow—with Thee; Wish I with the great to live, With the wealthy? No! with Thee; Nature's hand has mated us,— Who but I can go with Thee? II. There are few to whom, expiring, I would say, Forget me not? The busy world, the many-minded,—why should it forget me not? I have never worn its honours, never won its open shame, Never bent before it, never wooed it to forget me not; But if e'er my hand has wakened grateful hearts to yearn to mine, If I ever earned kind friendship, let those friends forget me not. And for Her who was and is my soul of soul—my life of life— 'Twould be wicked doubt to ask it—Leila will forget me not. Then mayst thou of all remembrance—thou whose knowledge only sleeps In the free-will of thy justice—Father—thou—forget me not! III. WRITTEN AT AMALFI. It is the mid-May Sun, that, rayless and peacefully gleaming, Out of its night's short prison, this blessèd of lands is redeeming; It is the fire evoked from the hearts of the citron and orange, So that they hang, like lamps of the day, translucently beaming; It is the veinless water, and air unsoiled by a vapour, Save what, out of the fullness of life, from the valley is steaming; It is the olive that smiles, even he, the sad growth of the moonlight, Over the flowers, whose breasts triple-folded with odours are teeming; Yes, it is these bright births, that to me are a shame and an anguish, They are alive and awake,—I dream, and know I am dreaming; I cannot bathe my soul in this ocean of passion and beauty,— Not one dew-drop is on me of all that about me is streaming; Oh! I am thirsty for Life,—I pant for the freshness of Nature, Bound in the World's dead sleep—dried up by its treacherous seeming. IV. TO ??. These lines may remind the German scholar of one of Göthe's most exquisite and most untranslateable Poems. Wherever Beauty is, I find thee there,— Through every veil and guise, I find thee there: Where the low zephyr dreams among thick flowers, Embalmer of sweet thoughts! I find thee there; Where full cascades leap down with curvèd steps, Form of essential Grace! I find thee there; In the broad mirror of the summer-sea, Crystal entire of Truth! I find thee there; In the unshaded presence of the sun, Illuminating Mind! I find thee there; In the mild splendours which enjoy the night, Radiance of gentlest Love! I find thee there; In the ecstatic realms that Prayer reveals, There, Humble Holiness! I find thee there. V. My own friend, my old friend! Time's a soldier bold, friend! Of his lofty prowess Many a tale is told, friend! Nations are his puppets, To be bought and sold, friend! He can mock the conqueror, Rase his strongest hold, friend! Fool the stern philosopher, Win the miser's gold, friend! But though earthly nature Has so frail a mould, friend! What the tyrant cannot do Is to make us cold, friend! VI. I've a Friend, a staunch Friend; listen, listen, Mary, mine! There's none such wherever Phœbus winds his airy line; When I rise at morn-time,—ere the grass his dewy tears Dries away, she meets me, beckoning oft with wary sign, That I tread discreetly, while she shows how round about With marigolds and violets she has pranked her dairy fine,— That the milk, fresh steaming, may be sweeter to my lips, Crowned with glowing blossoms,—so too is it, faery mine! When at eve out-wearied I approach, she brings me down What her own white hands have pressed—a flask of chary wine. There it is,—the nectar! where then is the Friend I mean? Where but here, beside me? kiss me, bless me, Mary mine VII. Shade not the light within thine eyes, The wondrous light within thine eyes; The Sun is all too fierce to hold Light such as that within thine eyes,— Yet is the passion of his warmth Less deep than that within thine eyes; The Moon is all too cold to wear Light such as that within thine eyes,— Yet is her flame less silver-clear Than that which glows within thine eyes. Thou art my Heaven; my Sun and Moon Are the mere light within thine eyes; Nature, that gave the world those orbs, Gave me the light within thine eyes;— I, and I only, can repose Within the light within thine eyes; Oh! Leila, what would be my gloom, Without the light within thine eyes? VIII. All things once are things for ever; Soul, once living, lives for ever; Blame not what is only once, When that once endures for ever; Love, once felt, though soon forgot, Moulds the heart to good for ever; Once betrayed from childly faith, Man is conscious man for ever: Once the void of life revealed, It must deepen on for ever, Unless God fill up the heart With himself for once and ever: Once made God and man at once, God and man are one for ever. BALLAD. GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD MORNING. A fair little girl sat under a tree, Sewing as long as her eyes could see: Then smoothed her work, and folded it right, And said, “Dear Work! Good Night, Good Night!” Such a number of rooks came over her head, Crying “Caw! caw!” on their way to bed: She said, as she watched their curious flight, “Little black things! Good Night! Good Night!” The horses neighed, and the oxen lowed: The sheep's “Bleat! bleat!” came over the road: All seeming to say, with a quiet delight, “Good little Girl! Good Night! Good Night!” She did not say to the Sun “Good Night!” Though she saw him there, like a ball of light; For she knew he had God's time to keep All over the world, and never could sleep. The tall pink foxglove bowed his head— The violets curtsied and went to bed; And good little Lucy tied up her hair, And said, on her knees, her favourite prayer. And while on her pillow she softly lay She knew nothing more till again it was day: And all things said to the beautiful sun, “Good Morning! Good Morning! our work is begun!” VERSICLES. [Amid the factions of the field of life] Amid the factions of the field of life The Poet held his little neutral ground, And they who mixed the deepest in the strife Their evening way to his seclusion found. There, meeting oft the' antagonists of the day, Who near in mute defiance seemed to stand, He said what neither would be first to say, And, having spoken, left them hand in hand. [I sent my memo'ry out] I sent my memo'ry out To chase a Thought: It brought back doubt on doubt, But never caught The fugitive,—who will return some day When I've no use for him in work or play. [The heart that Passion never fired] The heart that Passion never fired, Of other's Love can nothing tell— How can I teach you what's inspired, Unless you are inspired as well? [Because your nature can extend] Because your nature can extend Its vision to a needle's end, And you, with self-sufficient air, Announce the wonders you see there,— You must not murmur that some eye Moulded and trained to range the sky, May read in yon far star as clear As you can spy and potter here. (PREFIXED TO PALM LEAVES.) Eastward roll the orbs of heaven, Westward tend the thoughts of men: Let the Poet, nature-driven, Wander Eastward now and then: There the calm of life comparing With his Europe's busy fate, Let him, gladly homeward faring, Learn to labour and to wait. [Through clouds of care mankind must move] Through clouds of care mankind must move, —Each his appointed day; Only the glorious care of Love Drives other clouds away. [Since in this world's eternal chorus] Since in this world's eternal chorus Some voices must be high, some low, Let those that like it bawl and bore us, —But in the things they really know. TO A. H. H. (WRITTEN IN THE FIRST LEAF OF THE SELECTION OF MY POEMS.) Thou gleaner of the sunny hours, Harvested in the home of God, Gild me the future summer's hours, Revive the present ice-bound sod! Thou gleaner from the darkest hours Of scattered good I cannot see, Preserve thy dear remedial powers, And shed them, as I need, o'er me! New Year's Day, 1854. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II POEMS OF SENTIMENT AND REFLECTION. MUTABILITY. I saw two children intertwine Their arms about each other, Like the young tendrils of a vine About its nearest brother: And ever and anon, As gaily they ran on, They looked into each other's face Anticipating an embrace. I saw these two when they were men, I watched them meet one day, They touched each other's hands—and then Each went on his own way. There did not seem a tie Of love—a bond or chain, To make them turn the lingering eye, Or grasp the hand again. This is a page in our life's book We all of us turn over: The web is rent, The hour-glass spent, And, oh! the paths we once forsook How seldom we recover. Our days are broken into parts, And every remnant has a tale Of the abandonment of hearts, Which make our freshest hopes grow pale; And when we talk of Friendship mutter, We know not what it is we utter. I weep not that our fate is dark, I quail not that the wild winds hark About our heads, and miseries mark Their victories on our brows:— But though the dynasty of Fate Doth make our words a feather's weight, Doth mark our pledges with derision, And force us into indecision, And feigning of our vows— I care not that our lore may be Deep as the everlasting sea; When will the falling of a star, The darting of a sun-born beam, Compare with what our spirits are? And what unto ourselves we seem, Is tinctured with a life so small, So wretchedly ephemeral, As thrills our phantom-like communions— No fellow-soul's fraternal unions. TO A CHILD WITH BLACK EYES AND GOLDEN HAIR. When first, on that fair morn of May, Thou cam'st across my pilgrim way, My joy was shaded by much fear; Thy hair, all made of very light, Seemed almost too supremely bright For earth,—I asked Why wert Thou here? But when I watched those eyes below, So clear, yet darkling like the flow Of waters in a silent cave; I felt they were of human birth, Of Earth, though of the best of Earth; Quietly lucid, sweetly grave. Dear child! by Nature double-dowered, Thee I would surely deem empowered A great ensample-work to do; To show that Man, however crowned With rays of Heavenly Love, is bound To Earth's serene Affections too. 1832. CARPE DIEM. Youth, that pursuest with such eager pace Thy even way, Thou pantest on to win a mournful race: Then stay! oh, stay! Pause and luxuriate in thy sunny plain; Loiter,—enjoy: Once past, Thou never wilt come back again, A second Boy. The hills of Manhood wear a noble face, When seen from far; The mist of light from which they take their grace Hides what they are. The dark and weary path those cliffs between Thou canst not know, And how it leads to regions never-green, Dead fields of snow. Pause, while thou mayst, nor deem that fate thy gain, Which, all too fast, Will drive thee forth from this delicious plain, A Man at last. 1833. THE FLIGHT OF YOUTH. No, though all the winds that lie In the circle of the sky Trace him out, and pray and moan, Each in its most plaintive tone,— No, though Earth be split with sighs, And all the Kings that reign Over Nature's mysteries Be our faithfullest allies,— All—all is vain: They may follow on his track, But He never will come back— Never again! Youth is gone away, Cruel, cruel youth, Full of gentleness and ruth Did we think him all his stay; How had he the heart to wreak Such a woe on us so weak, He that was so tender-meek? How could he be made to learn To find pleasure in our pain? Could he leave us to return Never again! Bow your heads very low, Solemn-measured be your paces, Gathered up in grief your faces, Sing sad music as ye go; In disordered handfuls strew Strips of cypress, sprigs of rue; In your hands be borne the bloom, Whose long petals once and only Look from their pale-leavèd tomb In the midnight lonely; Let the nightshade's beaded coral Fall in melancholy moral Your wan brows around, While in very scorn ye fling The amaranth upon the ground As an unbelievèd thing; What care we for its fair tale Of beauties that can never fail, Glories that can never wane? No such blooms are on the track He has past, who will come back Never again! Alas! we know not how he went, We knew not he was going, For had our tears once found a vent, We' had stayed him with their flowing. It was as an earthquake, when We awoke and found him gone, We were miserable men, We were hopeless, every one! Yes, he must have gone away In his guise of every day, In his common dress, the same Perfect face and perfect frame; For in feature, for in limb, Who could be compared to him? Firm his step, as one who knows He is free where'er he goes, And withal as light of spring As the arrow from the string; His impassioned eye had got Fire which the sun has not; Silk to feel, and gold to see, Fell his tresses full and free, Like the morning mists that glide Soft adown the mountain's side; Most delicious 'twas to hear When his voice was trilling clear As a silver-hearted bell, Or to follow its low swell, When, as dreamy winds that stray Fainting 'mid Æolian chords, Inner music seemed to play Symphony to all his words; In his hand was poised a spear, Deftly poised, as to appear Resting of its proper will,— Thus a merry hunter still, And engarlanded with bay, Must our Youth have gone away, Though we half remember now, He had borne some little while Something mournful in his smile— Something serious on his brow: Gentle Heart, perhaps he knew The cruel deed he was about to do! Now, between us all and Him There are rising mountains dim, Forests of uncounted trees, Spaces of unmeasured seas: Think of Him how gay of yore We made sunshine out of shade,— Think with Him how light we bore All the burden sorrow laid; All went happily about Him,— How shall we toil on without Him? How without his cheering eye Constant strength enbreathing ever? How without Him standing by Aiding every hard endeavour? For when faintness or disease Had usurped upon our knees, If he deigned our lips to kiss With those living lips of his, We were lightened of our pain, We were up and hale again:— Now, without one blessing glance From his rose-lit countenance, We shall die, deserted men,— And not see him, even then! We are cold, very cold,— All our blood is drying old, And a terrible heart-dearth Reigns for us in heaven and earth: Forth we stretch our chilly fingers In poor effort to attain Tepid embers, where still lingers Some preserving warmth, in vain. Oh! if Love, the Sister dear Of Youth that we have lost, Come not in swift pity here, Come not, with a host Of Affections, strong and kind, To hold up our sinking mind, If She will not, of her grace, Take her Brother's holy place, And be to us, at least, a part Of what he was, in Life and Heart, The faintness that is on our breath Can have no other end but Death. 1833. ON LEAVING A PLACE WHERE ONE HAD DWELT MANY YEARS. There are some moments in each life With strange and wayward feelings rife, When certain words and certain things Strike on the heart unwonted strings, And waken forth some solemn tone Their nature yet has never known: And it is thus—when from some place, As from a long familiar face, Though you may wish the chain to sever, Still are you sad to part for ever. Perchance 'twas an unlovely spot, Perchance too that you loved it not,— Perchance that in that place had been Dramas of many a cloudy scene,— That there the first fresh tear was wept, Or youth's impatient vigil kept, That not a day you there had spent Held its unchequered merriment Marked by the free heart's earliest throes, And chronicled by childhood's woes,— Though soulless men may wonder why You heaved the involuntary sigh, And how the loss your soul oppress'd Of that ill-cherish'd when possess'd,— Yet when the twinkling eye has cast One look, and knows it is the last, And while that look is fixed behind, In every melancholy wind A myriad sorrowing voices come, The sighs of a remembered home, A long and terrible farewell Pronounced by lips invisible: When many an eye with rapture gleaming, And many a smile with joyance teeming, That may have saved you from despair, Or lightened up your sojourn there, By after-misery sorely tried, In death embalmed and sanctified, Have a new life within your brain, And seem to gaze and beat again.— Then thoughts of pain are all forgot, But pleasure's memory passes not: Yet this by some distrotion strange Its very being fain must change Using a stern reflective power, To dim with gloom that parting hour, As the low trembling spirit strays Amid the smiles of other days. These are the eras of Existence, The seasons these when all resistance To time and fate must ever seem A futile unconsoling dream. So much of life, we feel, is past, Whene'er we murmur forth “the last,”— So nearer are we to the shore, Where time and things of time are o'er, Where all is Present, and the Past Of aught can never be the Last. 1829. YOUTH'S FAIR RESOLVE. Dear friend, I would that our free life should be Like the red blood that bounding from the heart Speeds onward through each ministering artery, Bearing fresh force to each remotest part, And stagnates never, Till Death's uncouth and wintry mastery Dams up the river. Is it because our fellows are depraved That we should leave our work and be like them? No,—if the laws of love and truth are braved, From peasant's cap to jewelled diadem,— The more's the pity; “Ten righteous men,” the Patriarch says, “had saved The heaven-cursed city.” The hermit sage an ancient anchorite, Who went to wilds and made the wolves their friends, Even they perchance had fought a better fight, And served more righteously their being's ends, Had they remained In the world's pale, and kept, with perilous might, Their faith unstained: Had they abandoned ev'n the commune high Which oft in solitude they held with God,— The lonely prayer, the speechless ecstasy In which the angel-paths of Heaven they trod, And sacrificed Upon that altar which saw Jesus die, What best they prized. And I—oh! think you not I too have known 'Tis sweet to muse beneath the old elm tree, While night lets loose her drapery's spangled zone, Or watch the sun-god woo the western sea, With rich parade, And send my thoughts, to brave adventure prone, On strange crusade? Or else with you a' strolling hand in hand Break lances in a tournament of rhyme,— Dispute about the tints of faery-land,— Or, by some heritage which olden Time Has left the wise, Bid wondrous pageants, as by sorcerer's wand, Before us rise. If life were all like this to you and me, How would it matter to be young or old? Where is the privilege of youth's buoyancy, Could we thus turn Time's iron scythe to gold? The pleasures given To man were all too great, and there would be No want of heaven. Let us go forth, and resolutely dare, With sweat of brow, to toil our little day,— And if a tear fall on the task of care, In memory of those spring-hours past away, Brush it not by! Our hearts to God! to brother-men Aid, labor, blessing, prayer, and then To these a sigh! 1832. THE LAY OF THE HUMBLE. Le bon Dieu me dit—“Chante, Chante, pauvre petit.”— Beranger. I have no comeliness of frame, No pleasant range of feature. I'm feeble, as when first I came To earth, a weeping creature; My voice is low whene'er I speak, And singing faint my song; But though thus cast among the weak, I envy not the strong. The trivial part in life I play Can have so light a bearing On other men, who, night or day, For me are never caring; That, though I find not much to bless, Nor food for exaltation, I know that I am tempted less,— And that is consolation. The beautiful! the noble blood! I shrink as they pass by,— Such power for evil or for good Is flashing from each eye; They are indeed the stewards of Heaven, High-headed and strong-handed: From those, to whom so much is given, How much may be demanded! 'Tis true, I am hard buffeted, Though few can be my foes, Harsh words fall heavy on my head, And unresisted blows; But then I think, “Had I been born,— Hot spirit—sturdy frame— And passion prompt to follow scorn,— I might have done the same.” To me men are for what they are, They wear no masks with me; I never sicken'd at the jar Of ill-tuned flattery; I never mourned affections lent In folly or in blindness;— The kindness that on me is spent Is pure, unasking, kindness. And most of all, I never felt The agonizing sense Of seeing love from passion melt Into indifference; The fearful shame, that day by day Burns onward, still to burn, To'have thrown your precious heart away, And met this black return. I almost fancy that the more I am cast out from men, Nature has made me of her store A worthier denizen; As if it pleased her to caress A plant grown up so wild, As if the being parentless Made me the more her child. Athwart my face when blushes pass To be so poor and weak, I fall into the dewy grass, And cool my fevered cheek; And hear a music strangely made, That you have never heard, A sprite in every rustling blade, That sings like any bird. My dreams are dreams of pleasantness,— But yet I always run, As to a father's morning kiss, When rises the round sun; I see the flowers on stalk and stem, Light shrubs, and poplars tall, Enjoy the breeze,—I rock with them,— We're merry brothers all. I do remember well, when first I saw the great blue sea,— It was no stranger-face, that burst In terror upon me; My heart began, from the first glance, His solemn pulse to follow, I danced with every billow's dance, And shouted to their hollo. The Lamb that at its mother's side Reclines, a tremulous thing, The Robin in cold winter-tide, The Linnet in the spring, All seem to be of kin to me, And love my slender hand,— For we are bound, by God's decree, In one defensive band. And children, who the worldly mind And ways have not put on, Are ever glad in me to find A blithe companion: And when for play they leave their homes, Left to their own sweet glee, They hear my step, and cry, “He comes, “Our little friend,—'tis he.” Have you been out some starry night, And found it joy to bend Your eyes to one particular light, Till it became a friend? And then, so loved that glistening spot, That, whether it were far Or more or less, it mattered not,— It still was your own star. Thus, and thus only, can you know, How I, even scornèd I, Can live in love, tho' set so low, And'my ladie-love so high; Thus learn, that on this varied ball, Whate'er can breathe and move, The meanest, lornest, thing of all— Still owns its right to love. With no fair round of household cares Will my lone hearth be blest, Never the snow of my old hairs Will touch a loving breast; No darling pledge of spousal faith Shall I be found possessing, To whom a blessing with my breath Would be a double blessing: But yet my love with sweets is rife, With happiness it teems, It beautifies my waking life, And waits upon my dreams; A shape that floats upon the night, Like foam upon the sea,— A voice of seraphim,—a light Of present Deity! I hide me in the dark arcade, When she walks forth alone,— I feast upon her hair's rich braid,— Her half unclaspèd zone: I watch the flittings of her dress, The bending boughs between,— I trace her footsteps' faery press On' the scarcely ruffled green. Oh deep delight! the frail guitar Trembles beneath her hand, She sings a song she brought from far, I cannot understand; Her voice is always as from heaven, But yet I seem to hear Its music best, when thus 'tis given All music to my ear. She' has turned her tender eyes around, And seen me crouching there, And smiles, just as that last full sound Is fainting on the air; And now, I can go forth so proud, And raise my head so tall.— My heart within me beats so loud, And musical withal:— And there is summer all the while, Mid-winter tho' it be,— How should the universe not smile, When she has smiled on me? For tho' that smile can nothing more Than merest pity prove, Yet pity, it was sung of yore, Is not so far from love. From what a crowd of lovers' woes My weakness is exempt! How far more fortunate than those Who mark me for contempt! No fear of rival happiness My fervent glory smothers, The zephyr fans me none the less That it is bland to others. Thus without share in coin or land, But well content to hold The wealth of Nature in my hand, One flail of virgin gold,— My Love above me like a sun,— My own bright thoughts my wings,— Thro' life I trust to flutter on, As gay as aught that sings. One hour I own I dread,—to die Alone and unbefriended,— No soothing voice, no tearful eye,— But that must soon be ended; And then I shall receive my part Of everlasting treasure, In that just world where each man's heart Will be his only measure. 1833. THE VIOLET-GIRL. When Fancy will continually rehearse Some painful scene once present to the eye, 'Tis well to mould it into gentle verse, That it may lighter on the spirit lie. Home yester-eve I wearily returned, Though bright my morning mood and short my way, But sad experience in one moment earned Can crush the heaped enjoyments of the day. Passing the corner of a populous street, I marked a girl whose wont it was to stand, With pallid cheek, torn gown, and naked feet, And bunches of fresh Violets in each hand. There her small commerce in the chill March weather She plied with accents miserably mild; It was a frightful thought to set together Those healthy blossoms and that fading child :— —Those luxuries and largess of the earth, Beauty and pleasure to the sense of man, And this poor sorry weed cast loosely forth On Life's wild waste to struggle as it can! To me that odorous purple ministers Hope-bearing memories and inspiring glee, While meanest images alone are hers, The sordid wants of base humanity. Think after all this lapse of hungry hours, In the disfurnished chamber of dim cold, How she must loathe the very scented flowers That on the squalid table lie unsold! Rest on your woodland banks and wither there, Sweet preluders of Spring! far better so, Than live misused to fill the grasp of care, And serve the piteous purposes of woe. Ye are no longer Nature's gracious gift, Yourselves so much and harbingers of more, But a most bitter irony to lift The veil that hides our vilest mortal sore. 1837. ON MY YOUTHFUL LETTERS. Set to music by Mrs. Sartoris. Look at the leaves I gather up in trembling,— Little to see, and sere, and time-bewasted, But they are other than the tree can bear now, For they are mine! Deep as the tumult in an archèd sea-cave, Out of the Past these antiquated voices Fall on my heart's ear; I must listen to them, For they are mine! Whose is this hand that wheresoe'er it wanders, Traces in light words thoughts that come as lightly? Who was the king of all this soul-dominion? I? Was it mine? With what a healthful appetite of spirit, Sits he at Life's inevitable banquet, Tasting delight in every thing before him! Could this be mine? See! how he twists his coronals of fancy, Out of all blossoms, knowing not the poison,— How his young eye is meshed in the enchantment! And it was mine! What, is this I?—this miserable complex, Losing and gaining, only knit together By the ever-bursting fibres of remembrance,— What is this mine? Surely we are by feeling as by knowing,— Changing our hearts our being changes with them; Take them away,—these spectres of my boyhood, They are not mine. 1838. FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE. If I could coldly sum the love That we each other bear, My heart would to itself disprove The truth of what was there;— Its willing utterance should express Nothing but joy and thankfulness. Yet Friendship is so blurred a name, A good so ill-discerned, That if the nature of the flame That in our bosoms burned Were treasured in becoming rhymes, It might have worth in after-times. The Lover is a God,—the ground He treads on is not ours; His soul by other laws is bound, Sustained by other powers; We, children of a lowlier lot, Listen and understand him not. Liver of a diviner life, He turns a vacant gaze Towards the theatre of strife, Where we consume our days; His own and that one other heart Form for himself a world apart: A sphere, whose sympathies are wings, On which he rests sublime, Above the shifts of casual things, Above the flow of time; How should he feel, how can he know The sense of what goes on below? Reprove him not,—no selfish aim Here leads to selfish ends; You might as well the infant blame That smiles to grieving friends: Could all thus love, and love endure, Our world would want no other cure. But few are the elect, for whom This fruit is on the stem,— And for that few an early tomb Is open,—not for them, But for their love; for they live on, Sorrow and shame! when Love is gone: They who have dwelt at Heaven's own gate, And felt the light within, Come down to our poor mortal state, Indifference, care, and sin; And their dimmed spirits hardly bear A trace to tell what once they were. Fever and Health their thirst may slake At one and the same stream; The dreamer knows not till he wake The falsehood of his dream: How, while I love thee, can I prove The surer nature of our love? It is, that while our choicest hours Are closed from vulgar ken, We daily use our active powers,— Are men to brother men,— It is, that, with our hands in one, We do the work that should be done. Our hands in one, we will not shrink From life's severest due,— Our hands in one, we will not blink The terrible and true; What each would feel a heavy blow Falls on us both as autumn snow. The simple unpresumptuous sway, By which our hearts are ruled, Contains no seed of self-decay; Too temperate to be cooled, Our Passion fears no blast of ill, No winter, till the one last chill. And even then no frantic grief Shall shake the mourner's mind,— He will reject no small relief Kind Heaven may leave behind, Nor set at nought his bliss enjoyed, When now by human fate alloyed. 1838. THE FRIENDSHIP-FLOWER. When first the Friendship-flower is planted Within the garden of your soul, Little of care or thought is wanted To guard its beauty fresh and whole; But when the full empassioned age Has well revealed the magic bloom, A wise and holy tutelage Alone avoids the open tomb. It is not Absence you should dread,— For absence is the very air In which, if sound at root, the head Shall wave most wonderful and fair: With sympathies of joy and sorrow Fed, as with morn and even dews, Ideal colouring it may borrow Richer than ever earthly hues. But oft the plant, whose leaves unsere Refresh the desert, hardly brooks The common-peopled atmosphere Of daily thoughts and words and looks; It trembles at the brushing wings Of many a careless fashion-fly, And strange suspicions aim their stings To taint it as they wanton by. Rare is the heart to bear a flower, That must not wholly fall and fade, Where alien feelings, hour by hour, Spring up, beset, and overshade; Better, a child of care and toil, To glorify some needy spot, Than in a glad redundant soil To pine neglected and forgot. Yet when, at last, by human slight, Or close of their permitted day, From the bright world of life and light Such fine creations lapse away,— Bury the relics that retain Sick odours of departed pride,— Hoard, as ye will, your memory's gain, But leave the blossoms where they died. 1838. FAIR-WEATHER FRIEND. Because I mourned to see thee fall From where I mounted thee, Because I did not find thee all I feigned a friend should be; Because things are not what they seem, And this our world is full of dream,— Because thou lovest sunny weather, Am I to lose thee altogether? I know harsh words have found their way, Which I would fain recall; And angry passions had their day, But now—forget them all; Now that I only ask to share Thy presence, like some pleasant air, Now that my gravest thoughts will bend To thy light mind, fair-weather friend! See! I am careful to atone My spirit's voice to thine; My talk shall be of mirth alone, Of music, flowers, and wine! I will not breathe an earnest breath, I will not think of life or death, I will not dream of any end, While thou art here, fair-weather friend! Delusion brought me only woe, I take thee as thou art; Let thy gay verdure overgrow My deep and serious heart! Let me enjoy thy laugh, and sit Within the radiance of thy wit, And lean where'er thy humours tend, Taking fair weather from my friend. Or, if I see my doom is traced By fortune's sterner pen, And pain and sorrow must be faced,— Well, thou canst leave me then; And fear not lest some faint reproach Should on thy happy hours encroach; Nay, blessings on thy steps attend, Where'er they turn, fair-weather friend! 1843. LONELY MATURITY. When from the key-stone of the arch of life Man his ascent with earnest eyes surveys, Sums and divides the steps of peace and strife, And numbers o'er his good and evil days,— If then, as well may be, he stand alone, How will his heart recall the youthful throng, Who leapt with helping hands from stone to stone, And cheered the progress with their choral song! How will sad memory point where, here and there, Friend after friend, by falsehood or by fate, From him or from each other parted were, And love sometimes become the nurse of hate! Yet at this hour no feelings dark or fierce, No harsh desire to punish or condemn, Through the grave silence of the past can pierce, Reproach, if such there be, is not for them. Rather, he thinks, he held not duly dear Love, the best gift that man on man bestows, While round his downward path, recluse and drear, He feels the chill indifferent shadows close. Old limbs, once broken, hardly knit together,— Seldom old hearts with other hearts combine; Suspicion coarsely weighs the fancy's feather, Experience tests and mars the sense divine; Thus now, though ever loth to underprize Youth's sacred passions and delicious tears, Still worthier seems to his reflective eyes The Friendship that sustains maturer years. “Why did I not,” his spirit murmurs deep, “At every cost of momentary pride Preserve the love for which in vain I weep; Why had I wish, or hope, or sense beside? “O cruel issue of some selfish thought! O long, long, echo of some angry tone! O fruitless lesson, mercilessly taught, Alone to linger and to die alone! “No one again upon my breast to fall, To name me by my common Christian name,— No one in mutual banter to recall Some youthful folly or some boyish game; “No one with whom to reckon and compare The good we won or missed; no one to draw Excuses from past circumstance or care, And mitigate the world's unreasoning law! “Were I one moment with that presence blest, I would o'erwhelm him with my humble pain, I would invade the soul I once possest, And once for all my ancient love regain!” 1844. PAST FRIENDSHIP. We that were friends, yet are not now, We that must daily meet With ready words and courteous bow, Acquaintance of the street; We must not scorn the holy past, We must remember still To honour feelings that outlast The reason and the will. I might reprove thy broken faith, I might recall the time When thou wert chartered mine till death, Through every fate and clime; When every letter was a vow, And fancy was not free To dream of ended love; and thou Wouldst say the same of me. No, no, 'tis not for us to trim The balance of our wrongs, Enough to leave remorse to him To whom remorse belongs! Let our dead friendship be to us A desecrated name, Unutterable, mysterious, A sorrow and a shame. A sorrow that two souls which grew Encased in mutual bliss, Should wander, callous strangers, through So cold a world as this! A shame that we, whose hearts had earned For life an early heaven, Should be like angels self-returned To Death, when once forgiven! Let us remain as living signs, Where they that run may read Pain and disgrace in many lines, As of a loss indeed; That of our fellows any who The prize of love have won May tremble at the thought to do The thing that we have done! 1844. THE MEMORY OF LOVE. Religious Love! it is most sure and true, That Man, before he felt the dank night-air Of this our nether birth, thy kingdom knew, And bathed his Spirit in the day-spring there. Else could world-withered age and flippant youth, Minds of unloving and unlovely mould, Who hold the “ancient lie” for solid truth, And prize its wretched life-dross all as gold,— Could these, the minions of the dust,—even these, Descant of thee as a familiar name,— Detect thy signs, revere thy mysteries, And, godless else, adore thy altar-flame? And Poets too have been, who boldly own They never felt thy influence o'er them shine, But whose high Art has built thee many a throne, Where thou canst fitly sit, confessed divine. Remember then, oh Pilgrim! and beware,— Thou, with that Memory for a master-key, Wilt open Heaven, and be no alien there,— For as thou honourest Love—so will Love honour thee. 1839. LOVE AND NATURE. I. “Thou, that wert wont at Nature's shrine To worship all the year, Say are her features less divine, Her attitudes less dear? Or if her beauty's still the same, Then thou art dull and slow: She must be sooth a gentle dame To let thee woo her so.” “'Tis not, sweet friend! that I forget The charms of vale and hill: Sunset and dawn are lovely yet,— But thou art lovelier still: I prize the talk of summer brooks, The mountain's graver tone; But can I give them thoughts and looks That are of right thine own?” II. The Sun came through the frosty mist Most like a dead-white moon; Thy soothing tones I seemed to list, As voices in a swoon. Still as an island stood our ship, The waters gave no sound, But when I touched thy quivering lip, I felt the world go round. We seemed the only sentient things Upon that silent sea: Our hearts the only living springs Of all that yet could be! III. Till death the tide of thought may stem, There's little chance of our forgetting The highland tarn, the water-gem, With all its rugged mountain-setting. Our spirits followed every cloud That o'er it, and within it, floated; Our joy in all the scene was loud, Yet one thing silently we noted: That, though the glorious summer hue That steep'd the heav'ns could scarce be brighter, The blue below was still more blue, The very light itself was lighter. And each the other's fancy caught By one instinctive glance directed: How doubly glows the Poet's thought In the belov'd one's breast reflected! IV. There is a beechen tree, To whose thick crown a boy I clomb, And made me there a birdlike home To sing or ponder free. There is a jasmine bower, Whence you did see me trembling tear One spray to mingle with your hair, And loved me from that hour. Nature has odours none Like these to me: let some of each, Of jasmine flowers and leaves of beech, Adorn our house alone. V. Where'er about the world we roam, With heart on heart, and hand in hand, Each dwelling has the face of home, Each country is my native land.— With glad familiar looks I greet Places and sights unseen before: And wandering brook, and winding street, I follow as if passed of yore. But if some chance or duty calls Thee from me; then how great the change! I hardly know my father's halls, My mother's very smile is strange. Dead word become the books I read With most delight while thou art near; I seem thy present love to need, My dearest friendships to endear. VI. When long upon the scales of fate The issue of my passion hung, And on your eyes I laid in wait, And on your brow, and on your tongue, High-frowning Nature pleased me most, Strange pleasure was it to discern Sharp rocks and mountains peaked with frost, Through gorges thick with fir and fern. The flowerless walk, the vapoury shrouds, Could comfort me; though best of all, I loved the daughter of the clouds,— The wild, capricious, waterfall.— But now that you and I repose On one affection's certain store, Serener charms take place of those,— Plenty and Peace, and little more. The hill that tends its mother-breast, To patient flocks and gentle kine,— The value that spreads its royal vest Of golden corn and purple vine; The streams that bubble out their mirth In humble nooks, or calmly flow, The crystal life-blood of our earth, Are now the dearest sights I know. LOVE-THOUGHTS. I. All down the linden-alley's morning shade Thy form with childly rapture I pursue; No hazel-bowered brook can seek the glade With steps more joyous and with course more true. But when all haste and hope I reach my goal, And Thou at once thy full and earnest eyes Turnest upon me, my encumbered soul Bows down in shame and trembles with surprise. I rise exalted on thy moving grace, Peace and good-will in all thy voice I hear; Yet if the sudden wonders of thy face Fall on me, joy is weak and turns to fear. II. Think not because I walk in power, While Thou art by my side, That I could keep the path one hour Without my guard and guide. The keeper left me once alone Within a madhouse hall, With gibber, shriek, and fixèd smile About me,—madmen all! The horrid sense which then I felt Is what my life would be, If in this world of pain and guilt I once lost sight of Thee. III. Oh! let not words, the callous shell of Thought, Intrude betwixt thy silent soul and mine;— Try not the choicest ever Poet wrought, They all are discord in our life divine. Smile not thine unbelief. But hear and say All that Thou will'st, and then upon my breast Thy gracious head in silent passion lay One little hour, and tell me which is best. Now let us live our love; in after-hours Words shall fit handmaids to sweet Memory be, But let them not disturb these holier bowers, The voiceless depths of perfect sympathy. IV. Dream no more that grief and pain Could such hearts as ours enchain, Safe from loss and safe from gain, Free, as Love makes free. When false friends pass coldly by, Sigh, in earnest pity, sigh, Turning thine unclouded eye Up from them to me. Hear not danger's trampling feet, Feel not sorrow's wintry sleet, Trust that life is just and meet, With mine arm round Thee. Lip on lip, and eye to eye, Love to love, we live, we die; No more Thou, and no more I, We, and only We! V. I would be calm,—I would be free From thoughts and images of Thee; But Nature and thy will conspire To bar me from my fair desire. The trees are moving with thy grace, The water will reflect thy face; The very flowers are plotting deep, And in thy breath their odours steep. The breezes, when mine eyes I close, With sighs, just like mine own, impose; The nightingale then takes her part, And plays thy voice against my heart. If Thou then in one golden chain Canst bind the world, I strive in vain; Perchance my wisest scheme would be To join this great conspiracy. VI. I will not say my life was sad Before it stood fulfilled in Thee; The happy need not scorn the glad, Thy subjects need not mock the free: Mine was the moment's natural boon Lighting at will on these or those, Pleasures as constant as the moon, And Loves eternal as the rose. I prize the humblest ancient hour, When winged with light my spirit flew For honey's sake from flower to flower, Nor even asked where amaranth grew; Each creature's simple Providence Sufficed me well, until one day Thy presence roused in me the sense, How sure wert Thou, how frail were They! That instant Nature seemed a dream,— Thou waking in the midst alone,— And life her fast unpausing stream Contrasted with thine island-throne. Ah, why to me of all was given That only step of conscious pain, From joyous Earth to glorious Heaven, Scarce dead before I rose again! VII. All fair things have soft approaches, Quiet steps are still the sure; It were hard to point aright At what instant morning light, Shy and solemn-paced, encroaches On the desolate obscure;— Who can read the growth of flowers Syllable by syllable? Who has sight or ear to tell, Or by moments or by hours, At what rate the sappy tree, Full of life, and life in spring, Every sleekest limb embosses With the buds its vigour glosses,— At what rate the buds with glee Burst, and show the tender wing Of the leaf that hardly dares Trust to inexperienced airs? Who can measure out the pace Of the smiles on Nature's face? Thou loveliest of the thoughts of God, Creation's antitype and end! Thou treadest so the vernal sod That slimmest grasses hardly bend;— I feel thy presence sensible On my ideal supervene, Yet just the moment cannot tell That lies those two bright states between:— No memory has an arm to reach The morning-twilight of our thought,— The infant's use of sight and speech Is all unchallenged and unsought; And yet thou askest, winning one, That I should now unriddler be, To tell thee when I first begun To love and honour Thee! VIII. WRITTEN AT THE BATHS OF LUCCA. The fireflies, pulsing forth their rapid gleams, Are the only light That breaks the night; A stream, that has the voice of many streams, Is the only sound All around: And we have found our way to the rude stone, Where many a twilight we have sat alone, Though in this summer-darkness never yet: We have had happy, happy moments here, We have had thoughts we never can forget, Which will go on with us beyond the bier. The very lineaments of thy dear face I do not see, but yet its influence I feel, even as my outward sense perceives The freshening presence of the chestnut leaves, Whose vaguest forms my eye can only trace, By following where the darkness seems most dense. What light, what sight, what form, can be to us Beautiful as this gloom? We have come down, alive and consciöus, Into a blessèd tomb: We have left the world behind us, Her vexations cannot find us, We are too far away; There is something to gainsay In the life of every day; But in this delicious death We let go our mortal breath, Nought to feel and hear and see, But our heart's felicity; Nought with which to be at war, Nought to fret our shame or pride, Knowing only that we are, Caring not what is beside. FAMILIAR LOVE. We read together, reading the same book, Our heads bent forward in a half embrace, So that each shade that either spirit took Was straight reflected in the other's face: We read, not silent, nor aloud,—but each Followed the eye that past the page along, With a low murmuring sound that was not speech, Yet with so much monotony, In its half-slumbering harmony, You might not call it song; More like a bee, that in the noon rejoices, Than any customed mood of human voices. Then if some wayward or disputed sense Made cease awhile that music, and brought on A strife of gracious-worded difference, Too light to hurt our soul's dear unison, We had experience of a blissful state, In which our powers of thought stood separate, Each in its own high freedom, set apart, But both close folded in one loving heart; So that we seemed, without conceit, to be Both one and two in our identity. We prayed together, praying the same prayer, But each that prayed did seem to be alone, And saw the other, in a golden air Poised far away, beneath a vacant throne, Beckoning the kneeler to arise and sit Within the glory which encompassed it: And when obeyed, the Vision stood beside, And led the way through the upper hyaline, Smiling in beauty tenfold glorified, Which, while on earth, had seemed enough divine, The beauty of the Spirit-Bride, Who guided the rapt Florentine. The depth of human reason must become As deep as is the holy human heart, Ere aught in written phrases can impart The might and meaning of that extasy To those low souls, who hold the mystery Of the unseen universe for dark and dumb. But we were mortal still, and when again We raised our bended knees, I do not say That our descending spirits felt no pain To meet the dimness of an earthly day; Yet not as those disheartened, and the more Debased, the higher that they rose before, But, from the exaltation of that hour, Out of God's choicest treasury, bringing down New virtue to sustain all ill,—new power To braid Life's thorns into a regal crown, We past into the outer world, to prove The strength miraculous of united Love. 1835. POETRY AND THE POET. When, in a frame of liquid verse, I read you how pure Love's delight Is turned to Life's consummate curse, By woman's pride and hard despite,— Full many a sympathising chord Vibrated all your soul along; You trembled at each poignant word, And wept ere I had closed the song. But when, in rude and broken prose, I laid my heart before you bare,— Dared the deep misery to disclose, Which you had long awakened there; A trivial laugh, a pitying look (Yet half of scorn) was all you gave,— You bent before the lifeless Book, Though loth a living Heart to save. My Art is not a vulgar craft To work some passing Pleasure-spell,— There is no virtue in the draught For those who desecrate the well: Proud Loveliness! retain your sway,— Leave me to suffer as I can, But do not seem to love the Lay, And mock the Poet and the Man. 1836. PARTED AND MET. I. I know not, whether such great power Is in despair,—it may be so,— But, Myrrha, ere this ebbing hour Is over, I will try to go: Once more the glory of your form Shall fall upon my path,—once more! And fear not lest the inner storm Should burst the bounds it kept before. I have one last, light boon to pray— Do not be mercilessly kind; Hold back your hand, and turn away Those splendours I must leave behind; Or arm your eyes with chilly glare, (Though wont to be so burning-bright) Like their far sisters of the air, Which light, but cannot warm, the night. But most of all, I could not bear From you that mocking word, “Farewell!”— How well my riven heart will fare, I think I have not now to tell. Be silent, passionless—the ghost Of your own self—a solemn shade, Whose form, to others wholly lost, In my deep soul, as in a grave, is laid. II. My spirit staggered at the sight, So painful and so strange, I could not think that years had might To work such fearful change; And ere I ceased from wondering, My tears fell fast and free, That wretched, stricken, hopeless thing,— I dared not call it Thee. If I had heard that thou wert dead, I hastily had cried, “She was so richly favourèd, God must forgive her pride; My heart lay withered, while the crown Of life was fresh upon her,— I linger still, she has gone down In beauty and in honour.” But now, to see thy living death,— Power, glory, arts, all gone,— Thy empire lost, and thy poor breath Still vainly struggling on! Alas! a thought of saddest weight Presses and will have vent: “Had she not scorned my love,—her fate Had been so different! “Had her heart bent its haughty will To take me for its lord, She had been proudly happy still, Still honoured, still adored; The weak love-ties of face and frame Time easily may sever, But I had thought her still the same, As beautiful as ever. “She had then felt no shame or sorrow, At seeing fall away The slaves who mock the god to-morrow, They worshipped all to-day; While I preserved, with honest truth, Through every varying stage, Her image which adorned my youth, To glorify my age.” And do not treat this thought as light, Nor ask with taunting sign, “Has then thy life-course been so bright That thou canst scorn at mine?” Myrrha,—the name of Misery Is clear upon my brow, Yet am I not, nor e'er can be, So lorn a thing as Thou. He, who for Love has undergone The worst that can befall, Is happier thousand-fold than one Who never loved at all; A grace within his soul has reigned, Which nothing else can bring— Thank God for all that I have gained, By that high suffering! 1830. UNSPOKEN DIALOGUE. Above the trailing mignonette That dressed the window-sill, A Lady watched, with lips firm-set, And looks of earnest will: Four decades o'er her life had met, And left her lovely still. Not to the radiant firmament, Not to the garden's grace, The courses of her mind were bent,— But where, with sweetest face, Forth from the other window leant, The Daughter of the place. Thus ran her thoughts: “O, wretched day! When She was born so fair; Well could I let my charms decay, If she were not their heir: I loathe the sunbeams as they play About her golden hair. “Yet why? She is too good—too mild— So madly to aspire— He is no Boy to be beguiled By sparks of coloured fire; I will not dream a pretty child Can mar my deep desire. “Her fatherless and lonely days Are sere before their time; In scenes of gaiety and praise She will regain her prime, And cease to haunt these wooded ways, With sentimental rhyme.” On to the conscious maiden past Those words without the tongue; Half-petulantly back she cast The glistening curls that hung About her neck, and answered fast, “Yes, I am young—too young. “Yet am I graver than my wont, Graver when He is here; Beneath the glory of his front I tremble—not with fear, But, as I read, Bethesda's font Felt with the Angel near. “Must I mate only with my kind, With something as unwise As my poor self, and never find Affection I can prize At once with an adoring mind, And with admiring eyes? “My mother trusts to drag me down To some low range of life, By pleasures of the clamo'rous town, And vanity's mean strife; And in such selfish tumult drown My hope to be his wife.” Then darker round the Lady grew The meditative cloud,— And stormy thoughts began to brew She dared not speak aloud, For then, without disguise, she knew That rivalry avowed. “What is my being, if I lose My love's last stake? while She Has the fair future where to choose Her woman's destiny, Free scope those means and powers to use Which Time denies to me. “Was it for this her baby arms About my neck were flung? Was it for this I found such charms In her uncertain tongue? Was it for this those vain alarms My mother-soul unstrung? “O horrible! to wish my child— My sole one left—unborn, And, seeing her so meek and mild, To hold such gifts in scorn: My nature is grown waste and wild, My heart with fury torn.” Speechless—enchanted to the spot— The girl could scarce divine The whole disaster of her lot; But, without sound or sign, She cried, “O, mother! Love him not— O, let his love be mine! “You have had years of full delight— Your girlhood's passion-dream Was realized to touch and sight, As bright as it could seem; And now you interpose, like night, Before my life's first gleam. “Yet You were once what I am now, You won your maiden prize— You told me of my Father—how You lived but in his eyes: You spoke of the perpetual vow, The troth that never dies. “Dear mother! dearer, kinder, far, If by my childhood's bed Your care had never strove to bar Misfortune from my head, But laid me where my brothers are, Among the quiet dead. “Ah! why not die? This cruel strife Can thus—thus only—cease. Dear Lord! take home this erring life, This struggling soul release; From Heaven, perchance, upon his wife, I might look down in peace.” That prayer, like some electric flame, Struck with resistless force The Lady's agitated frame; Nor halted in its course Till her hard pride was turned to shame, Her passion to remorse. She spoke—her words were very low— But resolute in tone; “Dear child!—He comes—nay, blush not so To have your secret known, 'Tis best—'tis best that I should go— And leave you here alone.” Then, as his steps grew near and fast, Her hand was on the door, Her heart, by holy grace, had cast The demon from its core,— And on the threshold calm she past The Man she loved no more. 1850. NEVER RETURN! It was a meeting, such as on this earth The bonds of time and circumstances permit Rarely to those who feel and think as one: A small but “sacred band” wholly made up Of lovers—of old friends who had not met For many weary years—of some whose names Had to each other been familiar sounds, And who now felt their spirits meet and join At once, like waters—and of four who formed Two complete beings, man and woman blent, Ensamples of connubial unity. This wondrous concert of internal life Went on beneath the open infinite Of an Italian sky, that varied not More than the peace that dwelt within their souls; So that when, all at once, before their eyes The lake grew less transparent, and the leaves Of the pale olive less distinguishable, And the hills glow'd like metal, while the snow First turn'd to gold, then red, then deadly white, They were astonished at the flight of time That had not struck one hour within their hearts; And amid all the riches of that South They grudged the North its solitary charm Of long, long twilight, mourning bitterly That here the day was ravished from their eyes And bore a world of bliss along with it. At last one rose, one younger than the rest, One before whom life lay a glorious stream Flowing, by right divine, through pleasant lands, Unconscious of the fatal final sea. He stood irradiate with that rosy light, The funeral banner of the fallen sun, Most like an image of incarnate Hope, From whom no night can hide the coming morn. Raising one arm in ecstacy, he cried,— “Before we leave this consecrated spot, Before this Day of Days is wholly dead, Before the dew obliterates all our steps From this light earth, let us record a vow! Let us, in presence of these lasting hills, In presence of this day's delicious thoughts, That yet are hardly memory,—let us pledge Our hearts together, that on this same day Each rolling year shall see us meet again In this same place, as far as Fate allows. Some may be held away by cruel chance, Some by the great divorcer, none by choice; And thus, at least for a large lapse of time, One Day shall stand apart from other days, Birth-day of inward Life—Love's Holyday— The Wedding-day, not of one single pair, But of a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys,— The Saint's-day, in whose fair recurrent round Each year will circle all its blessedness.” With more than ready welcome, with loud glee, Was hailed this happy fancy; each was prompt To press the other's hand, and, joining round The founder of this mighty festival, To seal the sudden contract—all save One. This one had gazed on the impassioned youth With tender looks, that to the rest had seemed Fond sympathy,—but had far other sense. And now he spoke, at first with trem'lous voice, Softened, as if it passed through inner tears. “O Friends! dear Friends! do anything but this: This is a deed to wake the jealous gods Into a cruel vengeance. We are Men: We live from hour to hour, and have no right, Holding no power, to fetter future years. We may, if Heaven so please, preserve our loves, We may enjoy our interchange of souls Long, and in many shapes of time and fate; But to this spot, the scene of this To-day, Let us, whate'er befall, never return! “Never return! If hitherward your path Should chance to lie, when seeking other lands, Spare not the time it takes to circuit round This scene, and gaze upon its face no more. Say, if you will, ‘It lies amid the gold The sunset spreads beyond that purple ridge;’ Say, if you will, ‘The atoms of this stream Flow through the place I value most on earth, And bear my yearning heart along with them;’ Say, if you will, ‘There rests my Paradise;’ But there, whate'er befall, never return! “Never return! Should we come back, dear Friend! As you implore us, we should not return: Came we all back, as Heaven would hardly grant, There must be faded cheeks and sunken eyes, And minds enfeebled with the rack of time, And hearts grown colder, and, it may be, cold. The sun might shine as gorgeous as this noon, And yet find clouds between it and our souls; The lake might rest like light upon the earth, And but reflect to us sweet faces gone And pictures mournful as the dead below; The very flowers might breathe a poisonous breath Should we, led by false hope, ever return! “Trust not the dear palladium of the Past Upon the Future's breast. The Past is ours, And we can build a temple of rare thoughts, Adorned with all affection's tracery, In which to keep from contact vile and rude The grace of this incomparable Day. We may, by heart, go through it all again; We may, with it, give colour, warmth, and form To the black, shapeless mountains far away— Calm down the seething, hyperborean, waves To the pure sapphire of this lake, and spread Rose-trellises across the gloomy front Of blank old dwellings in the distant town; But we must keep the vision fresh as morn,— We must not risk that it should ever lose One of its features of staid loveliness, One of its sweet associated thoughts.— Therefore, whate'er befall, never return! “Never return! Time writes these little words On palace and on hamlet; strife is vain; First-love returns not,—friendship comes not back,— Glory revives not. Things are given us once, And only once; yet we may keep them ours, If, like this day, we take them out of time, And make them portions of the constant peace Which is the shadow of eternity!” So ended the serene Philosopher; And to all minds the sad persuasive truth Found an immediate access: the poor youth Whose spirit was but now a-fire with hope, Cast down his quenched enthusiastic eyes. “Never return!” in many various tones, All grave, yet none wholly disconsolate, Was echoed, amid parting signs of love, As they went on their common homeward way. Silent above, the multitudinous stars Said, “We are steadfast,—we are not as Ye.” Silent the fields, up to the phantom hills, Said, “We are dreaming of the vanished days Which we shall see again, but Ye no more.” So heavy pressed the meditative calm On those full hearts, that all rejoiced to hear The shrill cicala, clittering from below, Call on the fire-flies dancing through the vines. 1847. NOT TO-MORROW! O terrible To-morrow! that will come On me, alone and far away from Her, Who was my day, to-day, and every day: To-morrow she will not be by my side, And not to-morrow is as never more. As the poor Soul, that images itself Parted from God, its Father, and its Cause, Finds in that very parting all its sin, And in that very parting knows itself Evil and reprobate, and will not hear A single utterance of intrinsic hope: So to my heart the world to-come is blank, And not to-morrow is as never more. I will not sound the possibilities: I will not ask whether in some far time, In some far order of the Universe, In some far destination of myself, We may not meet again? I only know The burden of one thought that bears me down: And that to-morrow is as never more. Ever and Never—foolish play of words— Dancing before the finite mind of man: Our Ever is a sweet successive dream Of wavelets, over which the bounding heart Goes forward 'mid the shoals and rocks of Time, Until it crashes on the fronting shore: Our Never is the Present without Hope, And my next moment is as never more. Let the serene Philosopher sit down, Knowing that sorrow is the gift of God, And bid the streams of consolation flow Through the dim arid future: so have I Striven in my time, and conquered in the end. But how can it be good for me to lose My better self, my moral sustenance, One whom I followed in a heaven-ward path, To which I now can see no other clue? How can it make me better to be shorn Of that within me that can claim to be More than the crystal shining in the rock, More than the blossom withering at my feet? How can a man be wiser, if he lose All sense that makes the difference between This place and that, this circumstance and that, Between to-morrow's life and never more? I know to-morrow will be as to-day,— Sun-rise—bird's chirp—the stolid hours roll on, Careless of what they crush—without a thought That in the world there is a man the less, A mind the less t' engender noble deeds, A heart the less to beat for other men, A soul the less to claim eternal life,— For whom to-morrow is as never more. What is the presence of continuous pain, Some sharper and some better to be borne, Calling out courage in the patient man, Matched with this absence of the power to love, This loss of that within which can stand up In the broad face of Heaven, and say, “'Tis I, Living and suffering for some secret end Of the mysterious Master of us all:” Is it that I have given away Myself, And know not where to look for it again In any corner of the field of Time, While Not to-morrow is as Never more? 1860. HALF-TRUTH. The words that trembled on your lips Were uttered not—I know it well; The tears that would your eyes eclipse Were checked and smothered, ere they fell: The looks and smiles I gained from you Were little more than others won, And yet you are not wholly true, Nor wholly just what you have done. You know, at least you might have known, That every little grace you gave,— Your voice's somewhat lowered tone,— Your hand's faint shake or parting wave,— Your every sympathetic look At words that chanced your soul to touch, While reading from some favourite book, Were much to me—alas, how much! You might have seen—perhaps you saw— How all of these were steps of hope On which I rose, in joy and awe, Up to my passion's lofty scope; How after each, a firmer tread I planted on the slippery ground, And higher raised my ventur'ous head, And ever new assurance found. May be, without a further thought, It only pleased you thus to please, And thus to kindly feelings wrought You measured not the sweet degrees; Yet, though you hardly understood Where I was following at your call, You might—I dare to say you should— Have thought how far I had to fall. And thus when fallen, faint, and bruised, I see another's glad success, I may have wrongfully accused Your heart of vulgar fickleness: But even now, in calm review Of all I lost and all I won, I cannot deem you wholly true, Nor wholly just what you have done. 1840. ONE-SIDED TROTH. It is not for what He would be to me now, If he still were here, that I mourn him so: It is for the thought of a broken vow, And for what he was to me long ago. Strange, while he lived and moved upon earth, Though I would not, and could not, have seen him again, His being to me had an infinite worth, And the void of his loss is an infinite pain. I had but to utter his name, and my youth Rose up in my soul, and my blood grew warm; And I hardly remembered the broken truth, And I wholly remembered the ancient charm. I watched the' unfolding scenes of his life, From' the lonely retreat where my heart reposed; 'Twas a magical drama—a fabulous strife; Now' the curtain has fallen, the volume is closed. The sense of my very self grows dim, With nothing but Self either here or beyond; That Self which would have been lost in him, Had he only died ere he broke the bond. 1860. STRANGERS YET. Strangers yet! After years of life together, After fair and stormy weather, After travel in far lands, After touch of wedded hands,— Why thus joined? Why ever met, If they must be strangers yet? Strangers yet! After childhood's winning ways, After care and blame and praise, Counsel asked and wisdom given, After mutual prayers to Heaven, Child and parent scarce regret When they part—are strangers yet. Strangers yet! After strife for common ends— After title of “old friends,” After passions fierce and tender, After cheerful self-surrender, Hearts may beat and eyes be met, And the souls be strangers yet. Strangers yet! Oh! the bitter thought to scan All the loneliness of man:— Nature, by magnetic laws, Circle unto circle draws, But they only touch when met, Never mingle—strangers yet. Strangers yet! Will it evermore be thus— Spirits still impervious? Shall we never fairly stand Soul to soul as hand to hand? Are the bounds eternal set To retain us—strangers yet? Strangers yet! Tell not Love it must aspire Unto something other—higher: God himself were loved the best Were our sympathies at rest, Rest above the strain and fret Of the world of—strangers yet! Strangers yet! 1865. Set to music by Mrs. Bernard. (Claribel.) A RECOLLECTION. I knew that I should be his bride, And to my tearful eyes Lay that fair future, half descried Through a divine surprise: I knew that I should be his wife, And that his arm would bend Around me down the walks of life, As friend sustaining friend: And yet when I beheld him there, Amid a joyous throng, Amid the witty and the fair, Who knew and prized him long,— Amid the comrades of his youth, The kinsmen of his line, I almost faltered at the truth With which I called him mine. I saw they thought that I was proud To claim him as mine own, While all my being inly bowed As with a weight unknown. For if I dared my heart to place Above its own just meed, I might be distanced in a race In which the strong succeed! But now that years have rolled away, A variegated stream, And, one by one, that bright array Has vanished like a dream; Now that the very name of wife Has higher titles earned, I smile to ponder on that strife Of feelings undiscerned. Ah! had I known him but as they, How weary might have been The intercourse of every day, The rarely-changing scene,— The life that over-long may prove For passion or for power, But too, too, short for that still love Which blesses every hour. 1864. Set to music by Madame Sainton Dolby. RAPTURE. Because, from all that round Thee move, Planets of Beauty, Strength, and Grace, I am elected to Thy love, And have my home in Thy embrace; I wonder all men do not see The crown that Thou hast set on me. Because, when, prostrate at Thy feet, Thou didst emparadise my pain,— Because Thy heart on mine has beat, Thy head within my hands has lain, I am transfigured, by that sign, Into a being like to Thine. The mirror from its glossy plain Receiving still returns the light, And, being generous of its gain, Augments the very solar might: What unreflected light would be, Is just Thy spirit without me. Thou art the flame, whose rising spire In the dark air sublimely sways, And I the tempest that swift fire Gathers at first and then obeys: All that was Thine ere we were wed Have I by right inherited. Is life a stream? Then from Thy hair One rosebud on the current fell, And straight it turned to crystal there, As adamant immovable: Its steadfast place shall know no more The sense of after and before. Is life a plant? The King of years To mine nor good nor ill can bring;— Mine grows no more; no more it fears Even the brushing of his wing: With sheathèd scythe I see him go,— I have no flowers that he can mow. 1839. THE TREASURE-SHIP My heart is freighted full of love, As full as any argosy, With gems below and gems above, And ready for the open sea; For the wind is blowing summerly. Full strings of nature's beaded pearl, Sweet tears! composed in amorous ties And turkis-lockets, that no churl Hath fashioned out mechanic-wise, But all made up of thy blue eyes. And girdles wove of subtle sound, And thoughts not trusted to the air, Of antique mould,—the same as bound, In Paradise, the primal pair, Before Love's arts and niceness were. And carcanets of living sighs; Gums that have dropped from Love's own stem, And one small jewel most I prize— The darling gaud of all of them— I wot, so rare and fine a gem Ne'er glowed on Eastern anadem. I've cased the rubies of thy smiles, In rich and triply-plated gold; But this no other wealth defiles, Itself itself can only hold— The stealthy kiss on Maple-wold. 1839. SHADOWS. I. They owned their passion without shame or fear, And every household duty counted less Than that one spiritual bond, and men severe Said they should sorrow for their wilfulness. And truth the world went ill with them: he knew That he had broken up her maiden life, Where only pleasures and affections grew, And sowed it thick with labour, pain, and strife. What her unpractis'd weakness was to her The presence of her suffering was to him; Thus at Love's feast did Misery minister, And fill their cups together to the brim. They asked their kind for hope, but there was none, Till Death came by and gave them that and more; Then men lamented,—but the earth rolls on, And lovers love and perish as before. II. They seemed to those who saw them meet The casual friends of every day, Her smile was undisturbed and sweet, His courtesy was free and gay. But yet if one the other's name In some unguarded moment heard, The heart, you thought so calm and tame, Would struggle like a captured bird: And letters of mere formal phrase Were blistered with repeated tears,— And this was not the work of days, But had gone on for years and years! Alas! that Love was not too strong For maiden shame and manly pride! Alas! that they delayed so long The goal of mutual bliss beside. Yet what no chance could then reveal, And neither would be first to own, Let fate and courage now conceal, When truth could bring remorse alone. III. Beneath an Indian palm a girl Of other blood reposes, Her cheek is clear and pale as pearl, Amid that wild of roses. Beside a northern pine a boy Is leaning fancy-bound, Nor listens where with noisy joy Awaits the impatient hound. Cool grows the sick and feverish calm,— Relaxed the frosty twine,— The pine-tree dreameth of the palm, The palm-tree of the pine. As soon shall nature interlace Those dimly-visioned boughs, As these young lovers face to face Renew their early vows! IV. She had left all on earth for him, Her home of wealth, her name of pride, And now his lamp of love was dim, And, sad to tell, she had not died. She watched the crimson sun's decline, From some lone rock that fronts the sea,— “I would, O burning heart of mine, There were an ocean-rest for thee. “The thoughtful moon awaits her turn, The stars compose their choral crown, But those soft lights can never burn, Till once the fiery sun is down.” My friend Lord Lyttelton has permitted me to insert his Latin translation of these lines. Olim virgineum perdiderat decus Et laudem patriæ (jussit amor) domûs: Jam tædæ periit gratia mutuæ, Eheu! nec poterat mori! At solo in scopulo procubuit gemens, In fluctus roseum dum caderet jubar, Tunc “Ah! si, tacito sub pelagi sinu, Cordis flamma quiesceret! “Sic lenis solitam Luna manet vicem, Innectuntque chorum sidera lucidum, Sed nox ut placidas instituat faces, Sol componitur igneus.” V. 'Twould seem the world were large enough to hold Both me and thee: But now I find in space by thee controlled No room for me. We portioned all between us, as was fair; That time is past; And now I would recover my lost share, Which still thou hast. For that old love on which we both did live,— Keep it who can! Yet give me back the love I used to give To God and man. Give me my young ambition,—my fresh fire Of high emprize; Give me the sweet indefinite desire That lit mine eyes:— Give me my sense of pleasure;—give me all My range of dreams; Give me my power at sunset to recall The noontide's beams; If not my smiles, at least give back my tears, And leave me free To weep that all which man and nature cheers Is lost with thee! VI. They tell me I have won thy love,— That if there be One man most blest all men above, Then I am he; I answer not, resolved no more To linger here, And they have bitter words in store To taint thine ear. Did they not mark me dread to speak When thou wert by? Did they not watch my quivering cheek, My streaming eye? And can they fable none the less That I disdain A gift, whose very preciousness Is all my pain? 'Tis true, that when that fatal hour Did first disclose The mystery of my willess power O'er thy repose, I felt it was the ordainèd one That tie to sever, That only then it could be done, For once and ever! I shall not see thy motive grace Before me play, I shall not look upon thy face One other day! And yet I swear that I am free From bond or vow; What stands betwixt my soul and thee? Oh! ask not Thou. Time was, when I too had my part Of wealth divine, A simple, free, and plastic heart, Almost like thine, When lightened sorrow floated up And died in tears, And easy joy o'erflowed the cup Of eighteen years. If fate had then let cross our ways, Thou wouldst have been The Una of my nights and days,— My spirit's Queen;— Thou wouldst have led me glad and pure As thy white lamb; How dare I match this portraiture With what I am? It seems to me, as if that time, And I who wore Its aspect of delight sublime, Were nothing more Than visions, which poetic sloth So oft enjoys,— As if the Scene and Man were both Mere Fancy's toys. It may be that some help may come To my soul's need, My pilgrim thoughts may find a home In some new creed; But Thou, whose mind has never gone One dream astray,— Couldst thou be my companion, That perilous way? But I must check my words that flow Too fast and far; For worlds I would not thou shouldst know How such things are! Thou wilt not change, Thou wilt remain Serene and sure,— The touch of Time may well refrain From things so pure. And now that I have closed the strife, And view once more My future of ungenial life Spread out before,— To have found favour in thy sight Will still remain A river of thought, that full of light Divides the plain. ANIMA MUNDI. “Anima Mundi”—of thyself existing, Without diversity or change to fear, Say, has this Life to which we cling persisting, Part or communion with thy steadfast sphere? Does thy serene eternity sublime Embrace the slaves of Circumstance and Time? Could we remain continually content To heap fresh pleasure on the coming day, Could we rest happy in the sole intent To make the hours more graceful or more gay; Then must the essence of our nature be That of the beasts that perish, not of Thee. But if we mourn, not because time is fleeting, Not because life is short and some die young, But because parting ever follows meeting, And, while our hearts with constant loss are wrung, Our minds are tossed in doubt from sea to sea, Then may we claim community with thee. We cannot live by instincts—forced to let To-morrow's wave obliterate our to-day— See faces only once—read and forget— Behold Truth's rays prismatically play About our mortal eye, and never shine In one white daylight, simple and divine. We would erect some Thought the world above, And dwell in it for ever—we would make Some moment of young Friendship or First-love Into a dream, from which we would not wake; We would contrast our Action with Repose, Like the deep stream that widens as it flows. We would, indeed, be somewise as Thou art, Not spring and bud and flower and fade and fall,— Not fix our intellects on some scant part Of Nature, but enjoy or feel it all: We would assert the privilege of a soul, In that it knows—to understand the Whole. If such things are within us—God is good— And flight is destined for the callow wing, And the high appetite implies the food, And souls must reach the level whence they spring; O Life of very Life! set free our Powers, Hasten the travail of the yearning hours. Thou! to whom old Philosophy bent low, To the wise few mysteriously revealed; Thou! whom each humble Christian worships now, In the poor hamlet and the open field; Once an Idea—now Comforter and Friend, Hope of the human Heart! Descend! Descend! 1846. THE VOICES OF HISTORY. The Poet in his vigil hears Time flowing through the night,— A mighty stream, absorbing tears, And bearing down delight: There resting on his bank of thought He listens, till his soul The Voices of the waves has caught,— The meaning of their roll. First, wild and wildering as the strife Of earthly winds and seas, Resounds the long historic life Of warring dynasties:— Uncertain right and certain wrong In onward conflict driven, The threats and tramplings of the strong Beneath a brazen heaven. The cavernous unsounded East Outpours an evil tide, Drowning the hymn of patriarch priest, The chant of shepherd bride: How can we catch the angel-word, How mark the prophet-sound, 'Mid thunders like Niagara's heard An hundred miles around? From two small springs that rise and blend, And leave their Latin home, The waters East and West extend,— The ocean-power of Rome: Voices of Victories ever-won, Of Pride that will not stay, Billows that burst and perish on The shores they wear away. Till, in a race of fierce delight Tumultuous battle forth, The snows amassed on many a height, The cataracts of the North: What can we hear beside the roar, What see beneath the foam, What but the wrecks that strew the shore, And cries of falling Rome? Nor, when a purer Faith had traced Safe channels for the tide, Did streams with Eden-lilies graced In Eden-sweetness glide; While the deluded gaze admires The smooth and shining flow, Vile interests and insane desires Gurgle and rage below. If History has no other sounds, Why should we listen more? Spirit! despise terrestrial bounds, And seek a happier shore; Yet pause! for on thine inner ear A mystic music grows,— And mortal man shall never hear That diapason's close. Nature awakes! a rapturous tone, Still different, still the same,— Eternal effluence from the throne Of Him without a name; A symphony of worlds begun, Ere sin the glory mars, The cymbals of the new-born sun, The trumpets of the stars. Then Beauty all her subtlest chords Dissolves and knits again, And Law composes jarring words In one harmonious chain: And Loyalty's enchanting notes Outswelling fade away, While Knowledge, from ten thousand throats, Proclaims a graver sway.— Well, if, by senses unbefooled, Attentive souls may scan These great Ideas that have ruled The total mind of man; Yet is there music deeper still, Of fine and holy woof, Comfort and joy to all that will Keep ruder noise aloof. A music simple as the sky, Monotonous as the sea, Recurrent as the flowers that die And rise again in glee: A melody that childhood sings Without a thought of art, Drawn from a few familiar strings, The fibres of the Heart. Through tent and cot and proud saloon This audible delight Of nightingales that love the noon, Of larks that court the night,— We feel it all,—the hopes and fears That language faintly tells, The spreading smiles,—the passing tears,— The meetings and farewells. These harmonies that all can share, When chronicled by one, Enclose us like the living air, Unending, unbegun;— Poet! esteem thy noble part, Still listen, still record, Sacred Historian of the heart, And moral nature's Lord! THE BARREN HILL. Before my Home, a long straight Hill Extends its barren bound, And all who that way travel will Must travel miles around; Yet not the loveliest face of earth To living man can be A treasury of more precious worth Than that bare Hill to me. That Hill-side rose a wall between This world of ears and eyes And every shining shifty scene That fancy forms and dyes: First Babyhood engaged its use, To plant a good-child's land, Where all the streams were orange-juice, And sugar all the sand. A playground of unending sward There blest the growing Boy, A dream of labourless reward, Whole holidays of joy; A book of Nature, whose bright leaves No other care should need Than life that happily receives What he that runs may read. Nor lacked there skies for onward youth With wayward will to tinge, Sweet sunshine overcast by ruth, And storms of golden fringe: Nor vales that darkling might evoke Mysterious fellowship Of names that still to Fancy woke, But slumbered on the lip. The hour when first that hill I crost, Can yet my memory sting, The dear self-trust that moment lost No lore again can bring: It seemed a foully broken bond Of Nature and my kind, That I should find the world beyond The world I left behind. But not in vain that hill-side stood, On many an after-day, When with returning steps I wooed Revival of its sway; It could not give me Truth where doubt And sin had ample range, But it was powerful to shut out The ill it could not change. And still performs a sacred part, To my experienced eye, This Pisgah which my virgin heart Ascended but to die; What was Reality before In symbol now may live, Endowed with right to promise more Than ever it could give. 1839. THE CHRONICLE OF HOPES. I would not chronicle my life By dynasties of joy or pain, By reigns of peace or times of strife, By accidents of loss or gain: The Hopes that nurtured in my breast Have been the very wings to me On which existence floats or rests,— These only shall my eras be. Whether they rose to utmost height And glistened in the noonday sun, Descending with as full delight When all was realised and won; Or whether mercilessly checked By adverse airs and lowering skies, They sunk to earth confused and wrecked Almost before they dared to rise; With equal love I love them all For their own special sakes, nor care What sequence here or there might fall, Each has its sweet memorial share: Let but my Hopes, in coming years, Preserve their long unbroken line, And smiles will shine through any tears, And grief itself be half-divine. For not to man on earth is given The ripe fulfilment of desire;— Desire of Heaven itself is Heaven, Unless the passion faint and tire: So upward still, from hope to hope, From faith to faith, the soul ascends, And who has scaled the ethereal cope, Where that sublime succession ends? 1842. THE WORTH OF HOURS. Believe not that your inner eye Can ever in just measure try The worth of Hours as they go by: For every man's weak self, alas! Makes him to see them, while they pass, As through a dim or tinted glass: But if in earnest care you would Mete out to each its part of good, Trust rather to your after-mood. Those surely are not fairly spent, That leave your spirit bowed and bent In sad unrest and ill-content: And more,—though free from seeming harm, You rest from toil of mind or arm, Or slow retire from Pleasure's charm,— If then a painful sense comes on Of something wholly lost and gone, Vainly enjoyed, or vainly done,— Of something from your being's chain Broke off, nor to be linked again By all mere Memory can retain,— Upon your heart this truth may rise,— Nothing that altogether dies Suffices man's just destinies: So should we live, that every Hour May die as dies the natural flower,— A self-reviving thing of power; That every Thought and every Deed May hold within itself the seed Of future good and future meed; Esteeming Sorrow, whose employ Is to develope not destroy, Far better than a barren Joy. 1835. THE LONG-AGO. Eyes which can but ill define Shapes that rise about and near, Through the far horizon's line Stretch a vision free and clear: Memories feeble to retrace Yesterday's immediate flow, Find a dear familiar face In each hour of Long-ago. Follow you majestic train Down the slopes of old renown, Knightly forms without disdain, Sainted heads without a frown; Emperors of thought and hand Congregate, a glorious show, Met from every age and land In the plains of Long-ago. As the heart of childhood brings Something of eternal joy, From its own unsounded springs, Such as life can scarce destroy: So, remindful of the prime Spirits, wand'ring to and fro, Rest upon the resting time In the peace of Long-ago. Youthful Hope's religious fire, When it burns no longer, leaves Ashes of impure Desire On the altars it bereaves; But the light that fills the Past Sheds a still diviner glow, Ever farther it is cast O'er the scenes of Long-ago. Many a growth of pain and care, Cumbering all the present hour, Yields, when once transplanted there, Healthy fruit or pleasant flower; Thoughts that hardly flourish here, Feelings long have ceased to blow, Breathe a native atmosphere In the world of Long-ago. On that deep-retiring shore Frequent pearls of beauty lie, Where the passion-waves of yore Fiercely beat and mounted high: Sorrows that are sorrows still Lose the bitter taste of woe; Nothing's altogether ill In the griefs of Long-ago. Tombs where lonely love repines, Ghastly tenements of tears, Wear the look of happy shrines Through the golden mist of years: Death, to those who trust in good, Vindicates his hardest blow; Oh! we would not, if we could, Wake the sleep of Long-ago! Though the doom of swift decay Shocks the soul where life is strong, Though for frailer hearts the day Lingers sad and overlong,— Still the weight will find a leaven, Still the spoiler's hand is slow, While the Future has its Heaven, And the Past its Long-ago. 1834. SIMPLE SOUNDS. O Power! whose organ is the tremulous air, Thou that not only to the accordant sense Unfoldest all a world of harsh and fair, But hast a far diviner influence, Submitting to inscrutable controul The finest elements of human soul; O mystic Sound! what heart can keep aloof, If summoned to acknowledge thy bland sway, As thou approachest in the golden woof Of luscious harmonies serene or gay? But thou hast moods I would not honor less, Thy simplest forms of moral kingliness. How did my childish ecstasy burst out, When first I found thy Echoes at my call! What blithe caprice of whisper, song, and shout, Woke the steep hill and challenged the long wall! How we did laugh! I needed from that day Nor other playfellows nor other play. Further in life, when thoughts and feelings slept In my heart's tomb, some one particular tone Of common bells has stung me till I wept, And rushed away, oppressed by things foregone; For though the hours recalled be bright and glad, Still earnest memory ever will be sad. When late I changed the still unpeopled air Of the clear South for this my mother clime, I quivered with delight, as everywhere Sweet birds in happy snatches hailed the prime; A throstle's twitter made old walks arise, With lilac-bunches dancing in my eyes. What love we, about those we love the best, Better than their dear voices? At what cost Would one not gather to an aching breast Each little word of some whom we have lost? And oh! how blank to hear, in some far place, A voice we know, and see a stranger's face. I never hold my truth to God more leal Than when it thunders; that monotonous roll Has after-lightning potent to reveal Many dark words on Faith's sin-shaded scroll: Talk with a stormy sky, man! prone to deem That nothing is, because of thine own Dream. And now within the hush of evening waves, Cast by light force upon a shingly shore, My Spirit rests; the ruins and fresh graves That strewed its earthly path here vex no more: Rocked on the soothing surge, its life is all One soft attraction and one mellow fall. 1835. A PRAYER. Evil, every living hour, Holds us in its wilful hand, Save as thou, essential Power, May'st be gracious to withstand: Pain within the subtle flesh, Heavy lids that cannot close, Hearts that Hope will not refresh,— Hand of healing! interpose. Tyranny's strong breath is tainting Nature's sweet and vivid air, Nations silently are fainting Or up-gather in despair: Not to those distracted wills Trust the judgment of their woes; While the cup of anguish fills, Arm of Justice! interpose. Pleasures night and day are hovering Round their prey of weary hours, Weakness and unrest discovering In the best of human powers: Ere the fond delusions tire, Ere envenomed passion grows From the root of vain desire,— Mind of Wisdom! interpose. Now no more in tuneful motion Life with love and duty glides; Reason's meteor-lighted ocean Bears us down its mazy tides; Head is clear and hand is strong, But our heart no haven knows; Sun of Truth! the night is long,— Let thy radiance interpose! 1841. THE PAST. The Past—the Past!—it has a tolling sound, That solemn syllable, which calls to mind The prison of the Present rising round, And all the bonds that Time has power to bind. Sounds, sights,—all else the means of sense impart,— Seem to arouse to grief or joy in vain, While still it clanks upon the captive heart, That ever-moving, never lengthening, chain. Is there no art that can an echo make, To mock the splendid harmonies gone by? No charm that can the long-dead hours awake, In ghost-like silence and solemnity? Alas! though Memory, with her wilful wand, Can shadow forth a faint and vapid show, What boots the colourless unmeaning band? 'Tis but a dream,—we know it to be so. Of all our spiritual elements—of all Those powers by which we feel ourselves to be— Is there not one that can elude the thrall, True to itself, and as its Author free? Have we no heritage of Father-land? No ray immortal as the Parent Sun? No heaven-armed force, that can undaunted stand Guarding its own eternal garrison? Yes, we have that which lives a deathless life, No meagre phantom, spawned by human will, But strong to meet the Tyrant in the strife; Time has no rule o'er what he cannot kill. The feelings which the Heart has raised to birth, That holy mother never will disclaim; She is no hireling minister of earth; They are no bastard forgers of her name. Memorial flashes, transient as intense, A spirit darting through material night, Like lightning felt within the vivid sense, Yet seeming all too rapid for the sight. How we have joyed, when all our mind was joy, How we have loved, when love was all our law, Looked with half envy on the rising boy, And thought of manhood with religious awe. How we delighted in a thrice-sung song, A wilding's blossom, or a speckled stone, And how we numbered o'er the starry throng, And chose the brightest to be called our own. Or, when young Passion to excess had ranged, How conscience met it with her sacred string, And how we marvelled, what to frowns had changed The red-rose smiles that tinted every thing. How, when at first upon the fatal shore, Listening the murmurings of the waves of sin, A shivering chill came over us, before We bared our tender limbs and glided in. And when perchance some random bird obscene Flew screaming by, and warned us where we stood, With palsied feet, we turned us back to lean Resisting those who urged us to the flood. —Such thoughts can never die; the fire once kindled Lies smouldering in the ashes' dusty cove; Though one by one the tremulous sparks have dwindled, A flame will burst in times we wot not of. 1833. THE PALSY OF THE HEART. I see the worlds of earth and sky With beauty filled to overflow; My spirit lags behind the eye— I know, but feel not as I know: Those miracles of form and hue I can dissect with artist skill, But more than this I cannot do,— Enjoyment rests beyond the will. Round me in rich profusion lie Nectareous fruits of ancient mind, The thoughts that have no power to die In golden poesy enshrined: And near me hang, of later birth, Ripe clusters from the living tree, But what the pleasure, what the worth, If all is savourless to me! I hear the subtle chords of sound, Entangled, loosed, and knit anew; The music floats without—around— But will not enter and imbue: While harmonies diviner still, Sweet greetings, appellations dear, That used through every nerve to thrill I often hear, and only hear. O dreadful thought! if by God's grace To souls like mine there should be given That perfect presence of his face, Which we, for want of words, call Heaven,— And unresponsive even there This heart of mine could still remain, And its intrinsic evil bear To realms that know no other pain. Better down nature's scale to roll, Far as the base unbreathing clod, Than rest a conscious reasoning soul, Impervious to the light of God;— Hateful the powers that but divine What we have lost beyond recall, The intellectual plummet-line That sounds the depths to which we fall. 1841. THE WORLD TO THE SOUL. Soul! that may'st have been divine, Now I claim and take thee mine; Now thy own true bliss will be In thy loyalty to me. Though thou seemest without stain, There is evil in thy grain; Thou hast tasted of the fruit Of which Knowledge is the root. So I must not let thee rest, Lull'd on Faith's maternal breast; Faith and Fancy mar the plan Of the making of a man. So thy tender heart I bare To Ambition's frosty air; So I plunge thee deep in doubt, That thou may'st grow hard and stout. So I bid the eager Boy Sense in every form enjoy; Stinting not the moment's pleasure, Save to gain some fuller measure. Thou wilt lose at last the zest, Thou wilt need some higher quest; Then I bid thee rise a Man, And I aid thee all I can. Fix thee on some worthy aim, Proving danger, fronting shame; Knowing only friends or foes, As they speed thee or oppose: Trampling with thy rapid feet Feelings fond and pleas discreet; Only for excuses sue In the great things thou canst do. If what shone afar so grand, Turn to nothing in thy hand, On, again—the virtue lies In the struggle, not the prize; Only rest not: failure-curst Turn to Pleasure at the worst; That may calm thy conscience-cry— Death may give thee peace, not I. MOMENTS. I lie in a heavy trance, With' a world of dream without me, Shapes of shadow dance, In wavering bands about me; But, at times, some mystic things Appear in this phantom lair, That almost seem to me visitings Of Truth known elsewhere: The world is wide,—these things are small, They may be nothing, but they are All. A prayer in an hour of pain, Begun in an undertone, Then lowered, as it would fain Be heard by the heart alone; A throb, when the soul is entered By a light that is lit above, Where the God of Nature has centered The Beauty of Love.— The world is wide,—these things are small, They may be nothing, but they are All. A look that is telling a tale, Which looks alone dare tell,— When' a cheek is no longer pale, That has caught the glance, as it fell; A touch, which seems to unlock Treasures unknown as yet, And the bitter-sweet first shock, One can never forget; The world is wide,—these things are small, They may be nothing, but they are All. A sense of an earnest Will To help the lowly-living,— And a terrible heart-thrill, If you' have no power of giving; An arm of aid to the weak, A friendly hand to the friendless, Kind words, so short to speak, But whose echo is endless: The world is wide,—these things are small, They may be nothing, but they are All. The moment we think we have learnt The lore of the all-wise One, By which we could stand unburnt, On the ridge of the seething sun: The moment we grasp at the clue, Long-lost and strangely riven, Which guides our soul to the True, And, the Poet to Heaven. The world is wide,—these things are small,— If they be nothing, what is there at all? THE MEN OF OLD. I know not that the men of old Were better than men now, Of heart more kind, of hand more bold, Of more ingenuous brow: I heed not those who pine for force A ghost of Time to raise, As if they thus could check the course Of these appointed days. Still it is true, and over true, That I delight to close This book of life self-wise and new, And let my thoughts repose On all that humble happiness, The world has since foregone,— The daylight of contentedness That on those faces shone! With rights, tho' not too closely scanned, Enjoyed, as far as known,— With will by no reverse unmanned,— With pulse of even tone,— They from to-day and from to-night Expected nothing more, Than yesterday and yesternight Had proffered them before. To them was life a simple art Of duties to be done, A game where each man took his part, A race where all must run; A battle whose great scheme and scope They little cared to know, Content, as men at arms, to cope Each with his fronting foe. Man now his Virtue's diadem Puts on and proudly wears, Great thoughts, great feelings, came to them, Like instincts, unawares: Blending their souls' sublimest needs With tasks of every day, They went about their gravest deeds, As noble boys at play.— And what if Nature's fearful wound They did not probe and bare, For that their spirits never swooned To watch the misery there,— For that their love but flowed more fast, Their charities more free, Not conscious what mere drops they cast Into the evil sea. A man's best things are nearest him, Lie close about his feet, It is the distant and the dim That we are sick to greet: For flowers that grow our hands beneath We struggle and aspire,— Our hearts must die, except they breathe The air of fresh Desire. Yet, Brothers, who up Reason's hill Advance with hopeful cheer,— O! loiter not, those heights are chill, As chill as they are clear; And still restrain your haughty gaze, The loftier that ye go, Remembering distance leaves a haze On all that lies below. THE COMBAT OF LIFE. Ce n'est pas la victoire qui fait le bonheur des nobles cœurs,—c'est le combat. Montalembert. We have come out upon the field of Life, To war with Evil; by some mightier power Than Memory can embrace, or Reason know, We were enlisted into this great strife, And led to meet that unknown Enemy: Yet not like men brought blinded to a wood, Who, looking round them, where a hundred paths All undistinguished lead a hundred ways, Tormented by that blank indifference, Rather sit down and die than wander on,— Not thus, but with a tablet clear and sure, (Obscure in this alone, that it is graven On mortal hearts by an eternal hand,) An ever-present Law, within our Being, Which we must read whether we will or no, We are placed here and told the way to go. The Boy, who feels his foot upon the plain, And his young fingers clinging to the sword, For the first time—how loudly he proclaims The faith of his ingenuous chivalry! “What is to me that proudly-fronting force? Am I not brave and strong? Am I not here To fight and conquer? Have I not around A world of comrades, bound to the same cause, All brave as I—all led by the same chief, All pledged to Victory? Who dares to fear? Who dares to doubt? Is not the very pulse, That drives my spirit onward, as a Voice Hailing my glory?—Yes, the Power of Ill Shall quail before the virtue of my arm, And hostile darts fall pointless from my shield.” Poor youthful Heart! poor noble Self-deceit! Weak-winged Aspirant!—Step with me aside, 'Tis for a moment, mount this little hill,— Tell me and tell thyself what see'st Thou now. Look East and West, and mark how far extends This vainly mocked, this haughtily defied, This Might so easily to be laid low! There is no eminence on this wide space, So high that thou from it canst e'er behold A clear horizon: dark is all the space, Black with the masses of that Enemy; There is no point where Light can penetrate Those densely-banded Legions,—the green plain Shines through no interval. Brave though thou art, My Boy, where is thy trust in Victory now! Then gaze below, gaze on that waving crowd, The marshalled army of Humanity, From which thou art come out.—Loyal thou art, My Boy! but what avails thy feeble Truth, When, as thou see'st, of that huge multitude, Those still succeeding myriads there arrayed For fight, how few, how miserably few, Not only do not fervently work out Their Soldier-duty, but whose craven souls Do not pass over to the very Foe, And, mingling with his numbers numberless, Against their brethren turn unnatural arms,— Or else of honest wills, at first, like thine, After the faint resistance of an hour, Yield themselves up half-willing prisoners, Soon to be won by golden-guileful tongues, To do blithe service in the cause of Sin? Surely amid this general faithlessness, This common treason, where Desertion takes So sure a method, so distinct a form, That it may rather seem itself a Law Than the infraction, where the wonder is That those are loyal, not that these rebel,— Surely if we, who have our hearts awake To this most dreadful Truth, we who have learnt That Evil is a force, which when we meet In open battle, we are as a rush Before the whirlwind, cautiously retire To some deep-hidden cleft where'er we deem We are best sheltered from his poisoned touch And there in calm but tearful hopelessness, Mourning the cureless Agony of our world, Crouch in the dust and wait until the end, It were a bitter judgment and untrue, To brand us cowards, and our deeds a crime. But though the weakness of our human heart May thus be made more safe and innocent, Yet there are some to whom a strength is given, A Will, a self-constraining Energy, A Faith which feeds upon no earthly hope, Which never thinks of Victory, but content In its own consummation, combating Because it ought to combat (even as Love Is its own cause and cannot have another), And conscious that to find in martyrdom The stamp and signet of most perfect life Is all the science that mankind can reach, Rejoicing fights, and still rejoicing falls. It may be that to Spirits high-toned as these A revelation of the end of Time Is also granted; that they feel a sense Giving them firm assurance that the foe By which they must be crushed (in Death well-won Alone to find their freedom) in his turn Will be subdued, though not by such as They. Evil, which is the King of Time, in Time Cannot be overcome, but who has said That Time shall be for ever? Who can lay The limits of Creation? Who can know That Realm and Monarch shall not sink together Into the deep of blest Eternity, And Love and Peace be all the Universe? RETURNING DREAMS. In the lone silence of my later nights, The dreams I dreamt in youth come back to me Not a returning presence that affrights,— Nor a mere play of hard-forced memory,— But there is no reality which seems To me so real as those repeated dreams. I find, in such revivals of old joys, An earnest of the unity that reigns In this our inner life, an equipoise To all our vacillating outward pains; A constant well, from which our souls updraw Continuous Truth and undisturbèd Law. If few to us, and far between, appear The favoured hours at which reverberate These spiritual echoes, that from sphere To sphere are sped by Power compassionate, In Life's short pass, how rarely are we found Just at the point where strikes the heavenly sound! But unlike echoes among natural things, That live in faintness and are breathed away,— To ends most distant their reflection brings Glories and bliss impervious to decay, Fresh and refreshing as when first they come From the Eternal Thought, which is their home. As in that World of Dream, whose mystic shades Are cast by still more mystic substances, We ofttimes have an unreflecting sense, A silent consciousness, of some things past, So clear, that we can wholly comprehend Others of which they are a part, and even Continue them in action, though no stretch Of after-memory can recognise That we have had experience of those things, Or sleeping or awake;— Thus in the dream, Our Universal Dream, of Mortal Life, The incidents of an anterior Dream, Or, it may be, Existence (for the Sun Of Being, seen thro' the deep dreamy mist, Itself is dream-like), noiselessly intrude Into the daily flow of earthly things; Instincts of Good,—immediate sympathies, Places come at by chance, that claim at once An old acquaintance,—single, random, looks, That bare a stranger's bosom to our eyes; We know these things are so, we ask not why, But act and follow as the Dream goes on. Happy the many to whom Life displays Only the flaunting of its Tulip-flower, Whose minds have never bent to scrutinize Into the maddening riddle of the Root,— Shell within shell,—dream folded over dream,— No heart, no kernel of essential Being, For us to find, and feel that Truth is there! THE MARVEL OF LIFE. O Life! how like the common-breathèd air, Which is thy outward instrument, thou liest Ever about us, with sustaining force, In the calm current of our usual days Unfelt, unthought of; nay, how dense a crowd Float on upborne by the prolific stream, Even to the ridges of the eternal sea, Spending profuse the passion of their mind On every flower that gleams on either bank, On every rock that bends its rugged brow, Conscious of all things, only not of thee. Yet some there are, who in their greenest youth, At some rare hours, have known the dazzling light Intolerable, that glares upon the soul, In the mere sense of Being, and grown faint With awe, and striven to press their folded hands Upon their inner eyes, and bowed their heads, As in the presence of a mighty Ghost, Which they must feel, but cannot dare to see. It is before me now, that fearful truth, That single solitary truth, which hangs In the dark heaven of our uncertainties, Seen by no other light than its own fire, Self-balanced, like the Arab Magian's tomb, Between the inner and the outer World;— How utterly the wretched shred of Time, Which in our blindness we call Human Life, Is lost with all its train of circumstance, And appanage of after and before, In this eternal present; that we Are! No When,—no Where,—no How,—but that we Are,— And nought besides. Nor when our dazèd sight, Weaned from its first keen wonder, learns to fix The surer and more reasonable gaze Of calm concentrated philosophy On this intense idea, have we gained One instant's raising of the sacred veil, One briefest glimpse into the sanctuary.— We grasp at words, and find them meaningless, Bind thoughts together that will not be bound, But burst asunder at the very time We hold them closest,—find we are awake The while we seem to dream, and find we dream The while we seem to be the most awake; And thus we are thrown on from sea to sea. Can we take up the sparkles of choice light. That dance upon the ruffled summer waters, And make them up to one coherent sun? Can we transform the charred and molten dust Into its elemental diamond? And, tho' thus impotent, we yet dare hope, From this embasèd form, half earth, half heaven, Of most imperfect fragmentary nature, These scant materials of dethronèd power, This tarnished Beauty, marred Divinity, To fabricate a comprehensive scheme Of absolute Existence—to lay open The knowledge of a clear concordant Whole And penetrate, with foully-scalèd eyes, The total scope, and utmost distances, Of the Creations of the Living God. He was a bitter Mocker, that old Man Who bade us “know ourselves,” yet not unwise; For though the science of our Life and Being Be unattained and unattainable By these weak organs, though the athlete mind, Hardened by practice of unpausing toil, And fed to manhood with robustest meats, Never can train its sinews strong enough To raise itself from off the solid ground, To which the mandate of creating Will Has bound it; though we all must patient stand, Like statues on appointed pedestals, Yet we may choose (since choice is given) to shun Servile contentment or ignoble fear, In the expression of our attitude; And with far-straining eyes, and hands upcast, And feet half raised, declare our painful state, Yearning for wings to reach the fields of Truth, Mourning for wisdom, panting to be free. THE EXHAUSTION OF LIFE. The Life of man is made of many lives, His heart and mind of many minds and hearts, And he in inward growth most surely thrives Who lets wise Nature order all the parts: To each disposing what befits their scope, To boyhood pleasures without care or plan, To youth affections bright and light as hope, Deep-seated passions to the ripened man. Oh! well to say, and well if done as said: But who himself can keep each separate stage? Stand 'twixt the living feelings and the dead, And give its special life to every age? Who can forbid the present to encroach On what should rest the future's free domain, Holding the past undimmed by self-reproach, Nor borrow joy at usury of pain? Boyhood invades the phantasies of youth, Rocked in imagination's golden arms, And leaves its own delights of healthy truth For premature and visionary charms. Youth, to whom Poesy by right belongs And every creature of the fairy race, Turns a deaf ear to those enchanting songs, And sees no beauty in that dreamy face, But will, though by experience uninured, Plunge into deepest gulfs of mental fire, Trying what angels have in vain endured— The toils of Thought—the struggles of Desire: So that when Manhood in its place at last Comes and demands its labours and its powers, The Spirit's energies are worn and past, And Life remains a lapse of feeble hours. THE SOLITUDE OF LIFE. When Fancy's exhalations rise From youth's delicious morn, Our eyes seem made for others' eyes, Spirit for spirit born: But time the truthful faith controuls,— We learn too soon, alas! How wide the gulf between two souls, How difficult to pass! In twilight and in fearfulness We feel our path along From heart to heart, yet none the less Our way is often wrong. And then new dangers must be faced, New doubts must be dispelled,— For not one step can be retraced That once the Past has held. To some 'tis given to walk awhile In Love's unshaded noon, But clouds are gathering while they smile, And night is coming soon! Most happy he whose journey lies Beneath the starlight sheen Of unregretful memories Of glory that has been. We live together years and years, And leave unsounded still Each other's springs of hopes and fears, Each other's depths of will: We live together day by day, And some chance look or tone Lights up with instantaneous ray An inner world unknown. Then wonder not that they who love The longest and the best, Are parted by some sudden move Of passion or unrest: Nor marvel that the wise and good Should oft apart remain, Nor dare, when once misunderstood, To sympathise again. Come, Death! and match thy quiet gloom With being's darkling strife, Come set beside the lonely Tomb The Solitude of Life; And henceforth none who see can fear Thy hour, which some will crave, Who feel their hearts, though beating here, Already in the grave. THE WEARY SOUL. My soul is wasted with trouble and toil, The evening of Life is damp and chill,— She would go back and rest awhile, She can go back whene'er she will,— For' the Poet holds the Past in fee, That shadowy land is all his own, And he, not led by Memory, But as a man that walks alone In gardens long familiar, knows What spots afford the best repose. Surely she will not wander far,— Twilight is coming with never a star; Why may she not return where stands, Broadly towards the westering sun, That proud building of hearts and hands, Castle and Palace all in one, Over the portal named at length, “Successful Manhood's place of strength?” There she may traverse court and hall, Up to her favourite turret tall; She may recline her aching head On her ancestral purple bed, There, where at eve so oft she lay, I' the deep-embrasured window-bay, Giving her vision open reign Over the chequered world of plain— Of hues that rest and hues that pass, Sunset and autumn and tinted glass; While the buck's clear bell and the cattle's low, And every sound that is heard below, Were melted into one murmur soft Ere they could reach that couch aloft. Witness of that triumphant scene! Little you know what doom has been:— How at a blow the heavens were split, Words on the wall spontaneous writ, As with a pen of burning brass, “Vanitas, omnia Vanitas:”— How disappointment bared her hand, Vivid and red as the levin brand, Struck on the tower's sublimest crown, Shattered the sturdiest buttress down,— Till the poor Soul would fain have died 'Mid her annihilated pride. Speed her along, tho' night be drear,— Night be her cover, for none is here; Seek her a rest where'er you may, Not in this shelterless decay! There is a bower, a way-side bower, Rich with brede of berry' and flower,— Fair to dwell in and behold How the green is turning gold, Till the leafy screen repeat All the life without the heat: Music comes not here and there, Does not fill, but is, the air: Perfumes delicate and fine, Flower of orange, flower of vine, Take their place, without pretence, In the harmony of sense; Where the floating spirit dreams, Fed by odours, sounds, and gleams, Of this royal region hight, “Youth's dominion of delight.” Why then farther? why not here? Soul of sorrow, Mind of fear! Rest, as thou wert wont to rest, On the swell of Nature's breast. Hear that voice in angel's frame, Singing, “Youth is still the same; Cheery faces glimpsing round,— Limber feet on mossy ground Circumstance, the God of clay, We have fairly laughed away, And a power of other face, Hope, is seated in his place. Enter, all that come from far, Poor and naked as ye are; Very breath is here divine,— Bacchus has no need of wine!” “Friends!” the tearful soul replies, “Keep, oh! keep your Paradise! Once I gained your happy place, Ardent in the healthy race, One of many braced together, Comrades of the way and weather; Now alone I falter by,— Youth's the same,—but what am I? Just as sweet, as free from cares, Are your smiles,—but are not theirs: When the lips I pressed of old Lie beneath the sullen mould: When the voices I have known In hosannas like your own Answer to my yearning call, Thin and feeble, if at all; When the golden locks are grey, That made sunshine all my day; When my fibres fall together In your genial summer-weather;— How can I repose an hour In the graces of your bower? How should I take up my rest, As a strange unnatural guest, In this home of truth, in this My retreat of ancient bliss? Blasts of death-impregnate air Would, with all the flowers, be there,— Storms thro' all the blue be spread In thick battalia o'er my head; Pallid looks of friendships broken, Phantom words unwisely spoken, Thoughts of love and self-reproof Mingled in a fearful woof,— Wishes, when not wished in vain, Only realised for pain,— Things ye could not hear or see Would be all my company!” Disheartened spirit! thou art then In vain distinct from common men, If all thy weary quest of mind No true abiding-place can find, Whose charms the busy life subdue, And lure it from the outer view! No region of thy mortal lot Where Peace is native to the spot, Ready to greet, when care-begone, Imagination's pilgrim son. Yet onward;—it is well to stray Along this bleak and homeless way, Till thou canst raise thy conscious eyes Where Childhood's Atalantis lies, And recognise that idyl scene, Where all mild creatures, void of awe, Amid field-flowers and mountains green, Fulfil their being's gentle law. They will not fear thee; safe they dwell Within this armless citadel, Embastioned in the self-defence Of self-regardless innocence: On Sin or Sorrow's bosom lingers Each infant head in slumbers bland,— Secure the tender tiny fingers Enclasp the dark and withered hand. Abysms of thought and sense must be Between those simple souls and thee; But as the parent is beguiled Into the nature of the child, So mayst thou, tho' an alien here, By careful duty take thy part In all the feelings that endear The kingdom of the virgin heart. And thou wilt taste once more the rills Fresh gushing from the eternal hills, And feel delight in living air Without research of when and where; And hear the birds their song dispense With free descant, on branch and wing, Careless of other audience Than God who made and bade them sing. Till haply pausing some noon-day Amid the fairy-people's play, Along thy limbs the stony sleep That rounds our life shall calmly creep, And thou from Present and from Past, And things to come at once be freed, To rest for aye, or wake at last In God's own arms, a child indeed. THE MARTYRS OF THE MIND. Honour to the sacred Past! Reverence to the ancient days! Yet believe them not the last That demand your love and praise: Think not that the olden story Can within its depth enfold All the beauty and the glory That the heart of Man can hold. Think not rashly that, because Modern life is smooth and fine, 'Tis not subject to the laws Of the Master's high design: That we less require endurance Than in days of coarser plan,— That we less demand assurance Of the Godhead hid in Man. Trust me, Truth is still at war, Just as in the hard old time, With a thousand things that are— Births of woe and food for crime: Still to vindicate the right Is a rough and thankless game; Still the leader in the fight Is the hindmost in the fame. True, the penal fires are out— True, the rack in rust has lain— But the secret burning Doubt And the pangs of Thought remain: True, the mind of Man is free— Free to speak and write at will, But a power you cannot see Still can plague, and waste, and kill. Very tame our passions nestle, Very even seem our brows, Outward forces rarely wrestle, Soft the words the age allows: Incommunicable sadness Yet is haunting all the while— Yet one day the crouching madness Leaps from under all the smile. Ours is not the early Faith Which our fathers gazed upon, Till the iron gates of Death With a golden splendour shone; We must rest content with Hope, Fair to aid, but frail to rule: Gentle Hope! too weak to cope With the villain and the fool. Ours the shame to understand That the World prefers the lie That, with medicine in her hand, She will sink and choose to die; Ours the agonising sense Of the Heaven this Earth might be, If, from their blank indifference, Men woke one hour and felt as we! Heroes of the inward strife, Whom your spirit cannot prize; Saints of the mysterious life, Whom no Church can canonize; Unremembered—unrecorded— They are passing by you now; Other gifts are here rewarded, To far other names you bow. Yet the Power appears to-morrow, That to-day seems wholly lost, And the reproductive sorrow Is a treasure worth the cost: Fate permits no break or suture In the' Ideal of Mankind, Weaving out its brightest Future From the Martyrs of the Mind. SORROWS. I. Sister Sorrow! sit beside me, Or, if I must wander, guide me; Let me take thy hand in mine, Cold alike are mine and thine. Think not, Sorrow, that I hate thee,— Think not I am frightened at thee,— Thou art come for some good end, I will treat thee as a friend. I will say that thou art bound My unshielded soul to wound By some force without thy will And art tender-minded still. I will say thou givest scope To the breath and light of hope; That thy gentle tears have weight Hardest hearts to penetrate: That thy shadow brings together Friends long lost in sunny weather, With an hundred offices Beautiful and blest as these. Softly takest Thou the crown From my haughty temples down; Place it on thine own pale brow, Pleasure wears one,—why not Thou? Let the blossoms glisten there On thy long unbanded hair, And, when I have borne my pain, Thou wilt give them me again. If Thou goest, sister Sorrow! I shall look for Thee to-morrow,— I shall often see Thee drest As a masquerading guest: And howe'er Thou hid'st the name, I shall know Thee still the same As Thou sitt'st beside me now, With my garland on thy brow. II. O! mournful sequence of self-drunken days, When jovial youth had range of Nature's store! With fever-thirst for pleasure and for praise, I nauseate every draught, and ask for more. Look on me well, and early steep thy soul In one pure Love, and it will last thee long; Fresh airs shall breathe while sweltering thunders roll, And summer noons shall leave thee cool and strong. Across the desert, 'mid thy thirsty kind, Thy healthy heart shall move apace and calm, Nor yearning trace the horizon far behind, Where rests the fountain and the lonely palm. III. I had a home wherein the weariest feet Found sure repose; And Hope led on laborious day to meet Delightful close! A cottage with broad eaves and a thick vine, A crystal stream, Whose mountain-language was the same as mine: —It was a dream! I had a home to make the gloomiest heart Alight with joy,— A temple of chaste love, a place apart From Time's annoy; A moonlight scene of life, where all things rude And harsh did seem With pity rounded and by grace subdued: —It was a dream! IV. To search for lore in spacious libraries, And find it hid in tongues to you unknown; To wait deaf-eared near swelling minstrelsies, Watch every action, but not catch one tone;— Amid a thousand breathless votaries, To feel yourself dry-hearted as a stone,— Are images of that, which, hour by hour, Consumes my heart, the strife of Will and Power. The Beauty of the Past before my eyes Stands ever in each fable-haunted place, I know her form in every dark disguise, But never look upon her open face; O'er every limb a veil thick-folded lies, Showing poor outline of a perfect grace, Yet just enough to make the sickened mind Grieve doubly for the treasures hid behind. Through great memorials wandering to and fro, Waves of old Time about me seem to roll, Most like a tune heard somewhere long ago, Whose separate notes have left upon my soul Some footmarks as they past, and though I know That memory's hardest toil can raise the whole Into continuous being, never again, I still strive on as one in love with pain.— O Thou! to whom the wearisome disease Of Past and Present is an alien thing, Thou pure Existence! whose severe decrees Forbid a living man his soul to bring Into a timeless Eden of sweet ease, Clear-eyed, clear-hearted,—lay thy loving wing In Death upon me,—if that way alone Thy great Creation-thought thou wilt to me make known. Rome. 1834. V. Her heart is sick with thinking Of the misery of her kind, Her mind is almost sinking, That once so buoyant mind;— She cannot look before her On the evil-haunted way,— Uphold her, oh! restore her Thou Lord of Night and Day!— She cries, “These things confound me, They settle on my brain, The very air around me Is universal Pain. The earth is damp with weeping, Rarely the sun shines clear On any but those sleeping Upon the quiet bier. I envy not hard hearts, but yet I would I could sometimes forget; I would, though but for moments, look With comfort into Nature's book, Nor read that everlasting frown, Whose terror bows me wholly down. I cannot meet each pang I see With gratefulness that not on me Has fallen that rod, And make my fellow's agony The measure of my love to God. I bear an earnest Christian faith; I never shrunk at thought of death; I know the rapturous light of Heaven, To man's unscalèd vision given;— My spirit is not blind; but when The tortures of my brother men, The famine of gray hairs, The sick-beds of the poor, Life's daily stinging cares That crowd the proudest door, The tombs of the long-loved, The slowly-broken heart, Self-gloated power unmoved By Pity's tenderest art, Come thronging thick about me, Close in the world without me,— How should I not despond? How can I stretch my sight so far As where things blest and holy are? My mortal nature is too frail To penetrate the sable veil,— I cannot see beyond!” VI. Ye Roses of November, Ye are no joy to me; The roses I remember Are other than ye be! Your cordial kindred summer Has gone by long before, And Winter, the new-comer, Is a Lover fierce and frore. At sight of ye I tremble, As ye in this bleak air; I read a fearful symbol In what ye are and were; How all that's best and fairest, When past a petty reign, To those, who hold them dearest, Are Pain and only Pain. Beauty is always Beauty, Her essences divine The Poet, in his duty, May labor to combine; But Beauty wed to sorrow Is sad, whate'er we say,— Sad thinking for to-morrow, Sad presence for to-day! VII. Why wilt Thou ever thus before me stand, Thou ghostly Past? Always between me and the happy land Thy shade is cast. Thou art no midnight phantom of remorse, That I would lay:— My life has run a plain unnoted course, In open day. I would enjoy the Present, I would live Like one new-born: I value not the gifts Thou hast to give— Knowledge and Scorn. I would, for some short moments, cease to judge- Reckon—compare: And this small bliss Thou wilt persist to grudge, Still haunting there. Thou makest all things heavy with regrets; Too late—too soon: My mind is like a sun that ever sets, And knows no noon: I am become the very fool of time,— The world for me Has no sure test of innocence or crime; All things may be: For every notion that has filled my brain Leaves such a trace That every instant it may rise again And claim its place. Faces and fancies I have cursed or cherished Throng round my head; In vain I call on thee to leave the perished— To hide the dead. Confused and tost on this ideal sea, I hardly keep A sense of weak and maimed identity, More than in sleep: Save when the Future wins my yearning gaze, That shore where still Imagination resolutely stays The tide of ill. THE CURSE OF LIFE. All that flesh doth cover, Souls of source sublime, Are but slaves sold over To the Master Time, To work out their ransom for the ancient crime. Some go meet the morrow With industrious will,— Others toil in sorrow, Though their hands be still; Man must toil for good or he shall toil for ill. Grasping at one pleasure, We let others fall: Yet how scant the measure If we sum them all,— Honey-drops scarce tasted in a sea of gall. Did but tears and sighs Teach our minds to see, With clear-piercing eyes, Into Heaven's decree, By this time, how wise this world of ours would be! Knowledge worn by sadness Grows too faint to rise,— Anguish fathers madness,— Labour brutifies: If high feelings live, the Man a Martyr dies. Sleep of freshest childhood Hears the voice of doom;— Rambling in the wild wood, Culling every bloom, Tender brows are chilled by mist from out the tomb. Gazing on Creation With a first love's eye, Panting exaltation Sinks into a sigh,— For we learn so soon that what we love must die. Then we try to smother The Love-fire in our heart; Nature, our sweet Mother, Can no balm impart, For she too is sick with all the self-same smart. She would fain relieve us, Fain our grief beguile,— She cannot deceive us By her outward smile, For we know that Death torments her all the while. In the green bud's bosom There is secret pain, Bees to the same blossom Come not back again,— Waters weep, that seem to sing a happy strain. “We know that the whole Creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.”—St. Paul. The Gem of Love was shattered Long before our birth, Sparkles still are scattered Over the broad Earth,— Which some seek in vain, tho' some know not their worth. Some may find and hold them, Never to let go, Hearts that would enfold them In their vital glow,— When Circumstance comes in and works them double woe: Circumstance that ever Uses wicked skill All fond ties to sever, Bind them as we will, Till our broken being in Death is hushed and still. DOMESTIC FAME. Why is the Grave so silent? Why is the Tomb so dead? Wherefore this gloomy secret on each departed head? Why do we name them seldom, and then with voices low, As if some shame were on them, or superhuman woe? Were Death the sleep eternal that some despairing feign, Had never Faith engendered the hope to meet again,— Still why should this great absence obliterate with it tears The happiest recollections and sympathies of years? Oh, no! Death could not banish the love that lived complete, And passed away untarnished to its celestial seat! Oh, no! 'tis not the living that we should harshly blame, But that men lightly cherish their pure domestic fame. How few leave not behind them some cause to bless the tomb, That mercifully closes, and pardons in its gloom! How few go from us, leaving the thoughts of them so dear, That aye the prayer besets us, “O God! that they were here!” So that in distant evenings, when joyous faces glow About the Christmas fire-light and laughter melts the snow,— In pauses of the revel, some heart without a fear, Will passionately murmur—“Ah! why are they not here?” Or that in weary seasons, when sickness racks the brain, And lordly Reason falters, and Will is only pain,— Those whom they loved to counsel may mystically hear Their voices leading onwards the path they trod when here: Or that in awful moments, when evil seems set free To tempt mankind to question what God of Truth there be,— The sense how they, too, strove and conquered, serves to cheer The struggler, dimly conscious of spirits watching near. Not, then, to Heroes only, to Poet, Statesman, King, Let care of future glory its anxious duties bring; There is no name so lowly, that may not raise a shrine Of living hearts, to honour its memory as Divine! TO A MOURNER. Sleep not—you whose hope is dust, Love-deserted man! Or, if feeble body must, Seldom as it can. Sleep is kin to Death they tell, You for this might love it well, But it is a kinsman poor, Hardly gets beyond the door,— Never fairly dwells within Where they rest and weep not Who are safe from Pain and Sin; Sleep not, Mourner, sleep not. Misery spent revives in Sleep, Will has no resistance, Anguish delves abysses deep In that dream-existence. Then we wake and half-believe, That we may ourselves deceive, That the loss our souls deplore May be but a dream the more;— Till, at one sharp start, we know, Though we shriek and weep not, Our reality of woe,— Therefore, brother, sleep not! But let Sleep some wayward change Bring upon our being, Let sweet fancies freely range With calm thoughts agreeing: Let sad memory be abused By the pleasure circumfused, And dear forms no more below Softly round us come and go; Or let time be buried quite, And the moments creep not,— Though oblivion be delight, Still, poor mourner, sleep not! For an Agony will come, In the instant waking, Like a dagger driven home, Like a nerve in breaking; Consciousness recovering life But confounds us in the strife, Wholly yielded up to Pain, As when drowned men feel again; In that rush of gasping thought, Wo for them that weep not! Too, too, dearly may be bought Such repose—oh! sleep not! Rather think the Evil down, Rather weep it out; Certain grief remits its frown Easier than doubt. There are strong yet gentle powers In the growth of many hours; Sorrow longer-lived will gain Something more of peace than pain, Such as God's still works possess, Things that sow or reap not In the world of more and less, Live and die, but sleep not. REQUIESCAT IN PACE. We have watched him to the last We have seen the dreaded'king Smile pacific, as he past By that couch of suffering: Wrinkles of aggressive years, Channels of recondite tears, Furrows on the anxious brow All are smooth as childhood's now.— Death, as seen by men in dreams, Something stern and cruel seems, But his face is not the same, When he comes into the room, Takes the hand, and names the name, Seals the eyes with tender gloom, Saying, “Blessed are the laws To which all God's creatures bend: Mortal! fear me not, because Thine inevitable friend!” So when all the limbs were still, Moved no more by sense or will, Reve'rent hands the body laid In the Church's pitying shade, With the pious rites that fall, Like the rain-drops, upon all. What could man refuse or grant The spiritual inhabitant, Who so long had ruled within With power to sin or not to sin? Nothing. Hope, and hope alone, Mates with death. Upon a stone Let the simple name be writ, Traced upon the infant's front Years ago: and under it, As with Christian folk is wont, “Requiescat” or, may be, Symbol letters, R. I. P. Rest is happy—rest is right, Rest is precious in God's sight. But if He, who lies below, Out of an abundant heart Drawing remedies for woe, Never wearied to impart Blessings to his fellow-men If he never rested then, But each harvest gathered seed For the future word and deed,— And the darkness of his kind Filled him with such endless ruth, That the very light of truth Pained him walking 'mid the blind,— How, when some transcendant change Gives his being boundless range,— When he knows not time or space, In the nearness of God's face,— In the world of spirits how Shall that soul be resting now? While one creature is unblest, How can such as he have rest? “Rest in Peace,” the legend runs, Rest is sweet to Adam's sons. But can he whose busy brain Worked within this hollow skull, Now his zeal for truth restrain, Now his subtle fancy dull, When he wanders spirit-free In his young immortality! While on earth he only bore Life, as it was linked with lore, And the infinite increase Of, knowledge was his only peace; Till that knowledge be possest How can such a mind have rest? Rest is happy—rest is meet For well-worn and weary feet, Surely not for him, on whom Ponderous stands the pompous tomb, Prompt to blind the Future's eyes With gilt deceit, and blazoned lies: Him, who never used his powers To speed for good the waiting hours, Made none wiser for his seeing, Made none better for his being; Closed his eyes, lest others' woes Should disturb his base repose; Catching at each selfish zest; How can he have right to rest? Rather we would deem him driven Anywhere in search of heaven, Failing ever in the quest, Till he learns it is not given That man should by himself be blest. Here we struggle with the light, And when comes the fated night, Into Nature's lap we fall, Like tired children, one and all. Day and Labour, Night and Rest, Come together in our mind, And we image forth the blest To eternal calm resigned: Yet it may be that the' abyss Of the lost is only this, That for them all things to come Are inanimate and dumb, And immortal life they steep In dishonourable sleep: While no power of pause is given To the inheritors of Heaven; And the holiest still are those Who are furthest from repose, And yet onward, onward, press To a loftier godliness; Still becoming, more than being, Apprehending, more than seeing, Feeling, as from orb to orb In their awful course they run, How their souls new light absorb From the self-existing One,— Demiurgos, throned above, Mind of Mind, and Love of Love. THE POETRY OF THE PEOPLE. I. LABOUR. Heart of the People! Working men! Marrow and nerve of human powers; Who on your sturdy back sustain Through streaming Time this world of ours; Hold by that title,—which proclaims, That ye are undismayed and strong, Accomplishing whatever aims May to the sons of earth belong. Yet not on ye alone depend These offices, or burthens fall; Labour for some or other end Is Lord and master of us all. The high-born youth from downy bed Must meet the morn with horse and hound, While Industry for daily bread Pursues afresh his wonted round. With all his pomp of pleasure, He Is but your working comrade now, And shouts and winds his horn, as ye Might whistle by the loom or plough; In vain for him has wealth the use Of warm repose and careless joy,— When, as ye labour to produce, He strives, as active to destroy. But who is this with wasted frame, Sad sign of vigour overwrought? What toil can this new victim claim? Pleasure, for Pleasure's sake besought. How men would mock her flaunting shows, Her golden promise, if they knew What weary work she is to those Who have no better work to do! And He who still and silent sits In closèd room or shady nook, And seems to nurse his idle wits With folded arms or open book:— To things now working in that mind, Your children's children well may owe Blessings that Hope has ne'er defined Till from his busy thoughts they flow. Thus all must work—with head or hand, For self or others, good or ill; Life is ordained to bear, like land, Some fruit, be fallow as it will: Evil has force itself to sow Where we deny the healthy seed,— And all our choice is this,—to grow Pasture and grain or noisome weed. Then in content possess your hearts, Unenvious of each other's lot,— For those which seem the easiest parts Have travail which ye reckon not: And He is bravest, happiest, best, Who, from the task within his span, Earns for himself his evening rest And an increase of good for man. II. THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE. Who is this man whose words have might To lead you from your rest or care, Who speaks as if the earth were right To stop its course and listen there? Where is the symbol of command By which he claims this lofty tone? His hand is as another's hand,— His speech no stronger than your own. He bids you wonder, weep, rejoice, Saying,—“It is yourselves, not I; I speak but with the People's voice, I see but with the People's eye.”— Words of imposing pride and strength, Words that contain, in little span, The secret of the height and length Of all the intelligence of man. Yet, Brothers! God has given to few, Through the long progress of our kind, To read with eyes undimmed and true The blotted book of public mind; To separate from the moment's will The heart's enduring real desires, To tell the steps of coming ill, And seek the good the time requires.— These are the Prophets, these the Kings, And Lawgivers of human thought, Who in our being's deepest springs The engines of their might have sought: Whose utterance comes, we know not whence, Being no more their own than ours, With instantaneous evidence Of titles just and sacred powers. But bold usurpers may arise Of this as of another's throne; Persuasion waits upon the wise, But waits not on the wise alone: An echo of your evil self No better than the voice can be, And appetites of fame or pelf Grow not in good as in degree. Then try the speaker, try the cause, With prudent care, as men who know The subtle nature of the laws By which our feelings ebb and flow: Lest virtue's void and reason's lack Be hid beneath a specious name, And on the People's helpless back Rest all the punishment and shame. III. THE PATIENCE OF THE POOR. When leisurely the man of ease His morning's daily course begins, And round him in bright circle sees The comforts Independence wins, He seems unto himself to hold An uncontested natural right In Life a volume to unfold Of simple ever new delight. And if, before the evening close, The hours their rainbow wings let fall, And sorrow shakes his bland repose, And too continuous pleasures pall, He murmurs, as if Nature broke Some promise plighted at his birth, In bending him beneath the yoke Borne by the common sons of earth. They starve beside his plenteous board, They halt behind his easy wheels, But sympathy in vain affords The sense of ills he never feels. He knows he is the same as they, A feeble piteous mortal thing, And still expects that every day Increase and change of bliss should bring. Therefore, when he is called to know The deep realities of pain, He shrinks, as from a viewless blow, He writhes as in a magic chain: Untaught that trial, toil, and care, Are the great charter of his kind, It seems disgrace for him to share Weakness of flesh and human mind. Not so the People's honest child, The field-flower of the open sky, Ready to live while winds are wild, Nor, when they soften, loth to die; To him there never came the thought That this his life was meant to be A pleasure-house, where peace unbought Should minister to pride or glee. You oft may hear him murmur loud Against the uneven lots of Fate, You oft may see him inly bowed Beneath affliction's weight on weight:— But rarely turns he on his grief A face of petulant surprise, Or scorns whate'er benign relief The hand of God or man supplies. Behold him on his rustic bed, The unluxurious couch of need, Striving to raise his aching head, And sinking powerless as a reed: So sick in both he hardly knows Which is his heart's or body's sore, For the more keen his anguish grows His wife and children pine the more. No search for him of dainty food, But coarsest sustenance of life,— No rest by artful quiet wooed, But household cries and wants and strife; Affection can at best employ Her utmost of unhandy care, Her prayers and tears are weak to buy The costly drug, the purer air. Pity herself, at such a sight, Might lose her gentleness of mien, And clothe her form in angry might, And as a wild despair be seen; Did she not hail the lesson taught, By this unconscious suffering boor, To the high sons of lore and thought, —The sacred Patience of the Poor. —This great endurance of each ill, As a plain fact whose right or wrong They question not, confiding still, That it shall last not overlong; Willing, from first to last, to take The mysteries of our life, as given, Leaving the time-worn soul to slake Its thirst in an undoubted Heaven. IV. ALMS-GIVING. When Poverty, with mien of shame, The sense of Pity seeks to touch,— Or, bolder, makes the simple claim That I have nothing, you have much,— Believe not either man or book That bids you close the opening hand, And with reproving speech and look Your first and free intent withstand. It may be that the tale you hear Of pressing wants and losses borne Is heaped or color'd for your ear, And tatters for the purpose worn But surely Poverty has not A sadder need than this, to wear A mask still meaner than her lot, Compassion's scanty food to share. It may be that you err to give What will but tempt to further spoil Those who in low content would live On theft of others' time and toil; Yet sickness may have broke or bent The active frame or vigorous will,— Or hard occasion may prevent Their exercise of humble skill. It may be that the suppliant's life Has lain on many an evil way Of foul delight and brutal strife, And lawless deeds that shun the day; But how can any gauge of yours The depth of that temptation try? —What man resists—what man endures— Is open to one only eye. Why not believe the homely letter That all you give will God restore? The poor man may deserve it better, And surely, surely, wants it more: Let but the rich man do his part, And whatsoe'er the issue be To those who ask, his answering heart Will gain and grow in sympathy. —Suppose that each from Nature got Bare quittance of his labour's worth, That yearly-teeming flocks were not, Nor manifold-producing earth; No wilding growths of fruit and flower, Cultured to beautiful and good, No creatures for the arm of power To take and tame from waste and wood!— That all men to their mortal rest Passed shadow-like, and left behind No free result, no clear bequest, Won by their work of hand or mind! That every separate life begun, A present to the past unbound, A lonely, independent, One, Sprung from the cold mechanic ground! What would the record of the past, The vision of the future be? Nature unchanged from first to last, And base the best humanity: For in these gifts lies all the space Between our England's noblest men, And the most vile Australian race Outprowling from their bushy den. Then freely as from age to age, Descending generations bear The accumulated heritage Of friendly and parental care,— Freely as Nature tends her wealth Of air and fire, of sea and land, Of childhood's happiness and health. So freely open you your hand! —Between you and your best intent Necessity her brazen bar Will often interpose, as sent Your pure benevolence to mar: Still every gentle word has sway To teach the pauper's desperate mood, That Misery shall not take away Franchise of human brotherhood. And if this lesson come too late, Woe to the rich and poor and all! The maddened outcast of the gate Plunders and murders in the hall; Justice can crush and hold in awe, While Hope in social order reigns,— But if the myriads break the law, They break it as a slave his chains! V. “Beg from a beggar—Deark d'on dearka.”—Irish Proverb. There is a thought so purely blest, That to its use I oft repair, When evil breaks my spirit's rest, And pleasure is but varied care; A thought to gild the stormiest skies, To deck with flowers the bleakest moor,— A thought whose home is paradise,— The charities of Poor to Poor. It were not for the Rich to blame, If they, whom Fortune seems to scorn, Should vent their ill-content and shame On others less or more forlorn; But, that the veriest needs of life Should be dispensed with freer hand, Than all their stores and treasures rife,— Is not for them to understand. To give the stranger's children bread, Of your precarious board the spoil— To watch your helpless neighbour's bed, And, sleepless, meet the morrow's toil;— The gifts, not proffered once alone, The daily sacrifice of years,— And, when all else to give is gone, The precious gifts of love and tears! What record of triumphant deed, What virtue pompously unfurled, Can thus refute the gloomy creed That parts from God our living world? O Misanthrope! deny who would— O Moralists! deny who can— Seeds of almost impossible good, Deep in the deepest life of Man. Therefore, lament not, honest soul! That Providence holds back from thee The means thou might'st so well control— Those luxuries of charity. Manhood is nobler, as thou art; And, should some chance thy coffers fill, How art thou sure to keep thine heart, To hold unchanged thy loving will? Wealth, like all other power, is blind, And bears a poison in its core, To taint the best, if feeble, mind, And madden that debased before. It is the battle, not the prize, That fills the hero's breast with joy; And industry the bliss supplies, Which mere possession might destroy. VI. RICH AND POOR. When God built up the dome of blue, And portioned earth's prolific floor, The measure of his wisdom drew A line between the Rich and Poor; And till that vault of glory fall, Or beauteous earth be scarred with flame, Or saving love be all in all, That rule of life will rest the same. We know not why, we know not how, Mankind are framed for weal or woe— But to the Eternal Law we bow; If such things are, they must be so. Yet, let no cloudy dreams destroy One truth outshining bright and clear, That Wealth abides in Hope and Joy, And Poverty in Pain and Fear. Behold our children as they play! Blest creatures, fresh from Nature's hand; The peasant boy as great and gay As the young heir to gold and land; Their various toys of equal worth, Their little needs of equal care, And halls of marble, huts of earth, All homes alike endeared and fair. They know no better!—would that we Could keep our knowledge safe from worse; So Power should find and leave us free, So Pride be but the owner's curse; So, without marking which was which, Our hearts would tell, by instinct sure, What paupers are the ambitious Rich! How wealthy the contented Poor! Grant us, O God! but health and heart, And strength to keep desire at bay, And ours must be the better part, Whatever else besets our way. Each day may bring sufficient ill; But we can meet and fight it through, If Hope sustains the hand of Will, And Conscience is our captain too. SONNETS. THE PAINS OF YOUTH. A shadow, a light cloud, an April rain, And twenty other vain similitudes, Betoken that fast-springing Youth eludes The full impression of continuous pain. Strange fallacy! when all that then we feel Strikes home,—the veriest trifles how profound! When there is something in each precious wound That searing Manhood almost fails to heal. But let the harshnesses of daily life And all the blunt world's businesses have set A seal upon the fountain of the heart, Then tangled in the party-coloured strife, We throb with Love or Hate, we meet or part, Sigh, tremble, weep, pass onward and forget. HAPPINESS. Because the Few with signal virtue crowned, The heights and pinnacles of human mind, Sadder and wearier than the rest are found, Wish not thy Soul less wise or less refined. True that the small delights which every day Cheer and distract the pilgrim are not theirs; True that, though free from Passion's lawless sway, A loftier being brings severer cares. Yet have they special pleasures, even mirth, By those undreamt of who have only trod Life's valley smooth; and if the rolling earth To their nice ear have many a painful tone, They know, Man does not live by Joy alone, But by the presence of the power of God. THE SAME. A splendour amid glooms,—a sunny thread Woven into a tapestry of cloud,— A merry child a-playing with the shroud That lies upon a breathless mother's bed,— A garland on the front of one new wed, Trembling and weeping while her troth is vowed,— A school-boy's laugh that rises light and loud In licensed freedom from ungentle dread; These are ensamples of the Happiness, For which our nature fits us; more and less Are parts of all things to the mortal given, Of Love, Joy, Truth, and Beauty. Perfect Light Would dazzle, not illuminate, our sight,— From earth it is enough to glimpse at Heaven. THE SPRING AND THE BROOK. It may be that the Poet is as a Spring, That, from the deep of being, pulsing forth, Proffers the hot and thirsty sons of earth Refreshment unbestowed by sage or king. Still is he but an utterance,—a lone thing,— Sad-hearted in his very voice of mirth,— Too often shivering in the thankless dearth Of those affections he the best can sing. But Thou, O lively Brook! whose fruitful way Brings with it mirror'd smiles, and green, and flowers,— Child of all scenes, companion of all hours, Taking the simple cheer of every day,— How little is to thee, thou happy Mind, The solitary parent Spring behind! GOOD INTENTIONS. Fair thoughts of good, and fantasies as fair! Why is it your content to dwell confined In the dark cave of meditative mind, Nor show your forms and colours otherwhere? Why taste ye not the beautiful free air Of life and action? If the wintry wind Rages sometimes, must noble growth be pined, And fresh extravagant boughs lopped off by care? Behold the budding and the flowering flowers, That die, and in their seed have life anew; Oh! if the promptings of our better hours With vegetative virtue sprung and grew, They would fill up the room of living Time, And leave the world small space to nourish weeds of crime. GRAVE TEMPERAMENTS. To live for present life, and feel no crime,— To see in life a merry-morrice craft, Where he has done the best who most has laughed, Is Youth's fit heaven, nor thus the less sublime: But not to all men, in their best of prime, Is given by Nature this miraculous draught Of inward happiness, which, hourly quaffed, Seems to the reveller deep beyond all time. Therefore encumber not the sad young heart With exhortations to impossible joy, And charges of morose and thankless mood; For there is working in that girl or boy A power which will and must remain apart— Only by love approached and understood. ACTION AND THOUGHT. There is a world where struggle and stern toil Are all the nurture of the soul of man— Ordain'd to raise from life's ungrateful soil, Pain as he must, and Pleasure as he can. Then to that other world of thought from this Turns the sad soul, all hopeful of repose, But round in weirdest metamorphosis, False shapes and true, divine and devilish, close. Above these two, and resting upon each A meditative and compassionate eye, Broodeth the Spirit of God: thence evermore, On those poor wanderers cast from shore to shore, Falleth a voice, omnipotent to teach Them that will hear,—“Despair not! it is I.” PRAYER. In reverence will we speak of those that woo The ear Divine with clear and ready prayer; And, while their voices cleave the Sabbath air, Know their bright thoughts are winging heavenward too. Yet many a one,—“the latchet of whose shoe” These might not loose,—will often only dare Lay some poor words between him and despair— “Father forgive! we know not what we do.” For, as Christ pray'd, so echoes our weak heart, Yearning the ways of God to vindicate, But worn and wilder'd by the shows of fate, Of good oppressed and beautiful defiled, Dim alien force, that draws or holds apart From its dear home that wandering spirit-child. LESSON TO POETS. Try not, or murmur not if tried in vain, In fair rememberable words to set Each scene or presence of especial gain, As hoarded gems in precious cabinet. Simply enjoy the present loveliness;— Let it become a portion of your being; Close your glad gaze, but see it none the less, No clearer with your eye, than spirit, seeing. And, when you part at last, turn once again, Swearing that beauty shall be unforgot: So in far sorrows it shall ease your pain, In distant struggles it shall calm your strife, And in your further and serener life, Who says that it shall be remember'd not? INDIRECT BEAUTY. Poet and Artist think and care not whether Things hold in truth the glory that they show; Beauty and beauteous thoughts will go together, While to one scene a thousand memories flow; Long spirit-strains from one wild note shall grow, Magnificent tempests from one cloudy feather, From one bright ray the sunset's perfect glow, Hymettian thyme-beds from one plant of heather. Into one scene a thousand memories flow! Held we but this reflection at our hearts, And beauty never past without regard, No place would lack illuminated parts, And inward grace with outer mingle so, That Nature should be never dark or hard. TO CHARLES LAMB. Thee I would think one of the many Wise, Who in Eliza's time sat eminent, To our now world, his Purgatory, sent To teach us what true English Poets prize. Pasquilant froth and foreign galliardize Are none of thine; but, when of gay intent, Thou usest staid old English merriment, Mannerly mirth, which no one dare despise. The scoffs and girds of our poor critic rout Must move thy pity, as amidst their mime, Monk of Truth's Order, from thy memories Thou dost updraw sublime simplicities, Grand Thoughts that never can be wearied out, Showing the unreality of Time. TO A CERTAIN POET. At Beauty's altar fervent acolyte, And favored candidate for priestly name, In object as in force adore aright Nor waste one breath of thy rare gift of flame; Nature, Artistic Form, Music,—all these Are shapes where partial Beauty deigns to lie, And mediate, as with types and images, Between frail hearts and perfect Deity. From Thee a purer faith is due,—to find The Beauty of Life,— the Melody of Mind,— Which the true Poet's quest never eludes: Speed Thou Philosophy's straight-onward flight, Aiming thy wings at that serenest height, Where Wordsworth stands, feeding the multitudes. LOVE WITHOUT SYMPATHY. Yes, I will blame thy very height of heart, I will conjure thee to remember still That things above us are not less apart, And mountains nearest to the sun most chill! Well hadst thou held sublime and separate rank, Martyr or heroine of romantic times, When Woman's life was one poor cloudy blank, Lit by rare-gleaming virtues, loves, and crimes. But now that every day for thee and me Has its own being of delight and woe, Come down, bright star! from thy perennial vault, My earthly path's companion-light to be; And I will love thee more for every fault Than for perfections that the angels show. ON ALFRED OF ENGLAND. Alfred judged, and we have his own words before us grounded on such judgment, that it is better to permit the continuance of a defective law, than to destroy the foundation upon which all laws depend,—respect for established authority,—which sudden changes, even for the better, are apt to undermine. Palgrave. There rose, from out a most discordant age, A mind attuned to that slow harmony, With which the Former of Humanity Unfolds his book of will, from page to page. War, with that generous passion, he did wage, Which was the soul of Christian chivalry,— But governing, his wise humility Against high Heaven threw down no venturous gage. He knew, how staidly moves the Spirit of Law, Even as the dial-shade,—that men with awe May recognise the one law-giving hand; And thus the Ruler, whom his own proud will Urges unbridled, be it for good or ill, Brings on himself like shame and misery on the land. INSERTED IN M. RIO'S WORK, “LA PETITE CHOUANNERIE.” For honest men, of every blood and creed, Let green La Vendée rest a sacred spot; Be all the guilt of Quiberon forgot In the bright memory of its martyr-deed! And let this little book be one more seed, Whence sympathies may spring, encumbered not By circumstance of birth or mortal lot, But claiming virtue's universal meed! And as those two great languages, whose sound Has echoed through the realms of modern time, Feeding with thoughts and sentiments sublime Each other and the listening world around, Meet in these pages as on neutral ground,— So may their nations' hearts in sweet accord be found! O France and England! on whose lofty crests The day-spring of the Future flows so free, Save where the cloud of your hostility Settles between, and holy light arrests, Shall Ye, first instruments of God's behests, But blunt each other? Shall Barbarians see The two fair sisters of civility Turn a fierce wrath against each other's breasts? No!—by our common hope and being—no! By the expanding might and bliss of peace, By the revealed fatuity of war, England and France shall not be foe to foe: For how can earth her store of good increase, If what God loves to make man's passions still will mar? ON TURNER'S PICTURE OF THE TÉMÉRAIRE MAN-OF-WAR, TOWED INTO PORT BY A STEAMER, FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING BROKEN UP. See how that small concentrate fiery force Is grappling with the glory of the main, That follows, like some grave heroic corse, Dragged by a suttler from the heap of slain. Thy solemn presence brings us more than pain— Something which Fancy moulds into remorse, That We, who of thine honour hold the gain, Should from its dignity thy form divorce. Yet will we read in thy high-vaunting Name, How Britain did what France could only dare, And, while the sunset gilds the darkening air, We will fill up thy shadowy lines with fame, And, tomb or temple, hail thee still the same, Home of great thoughts, memorial Téméraire! TO QUEEN VICTORIA. ON A PUBLIC CELEBRATION. How art Thou calm amid the storm, young Queen! Amid this wide and joy-distracted throng? Where has the range of life-experience been To keep thy heart thus equable and strong? Can the secluded cold which may belong To such high state compose thy noble mien, Without the duteous purpose not to wrong The truth of some Ideal spirit-seen? Perchance the depth of what I boldly asked None know—nor I, nor Thou. Yet let us pray That Thou, in this exceeding glory masked, Be not to loss of thy true self beguiled; Still able at thy Maker's feet to lay The living, loving, nature of a child! SONGS. A CHILD'S SONG. “I see the Moon, and the Moon sees me, God bless the Moon, and God bless me.”—Old Rhyme. Lady Moon, Lady Moon, where are you roving? Over the sea. Lady Moon, Lady Moon, whom are you loving? All that love me. Are you not tired with rolling, and never Resting to sleep? Why look so pale, and so sad, as forever Wishing to weep. Ask me not this, little child, if you love me; You are too bold; I must obey my dear Father above me, And do as I'm told. Lady Moon, Lady Moon, where are you roving? Over the sea. Lady Moon, Lady Moon, whom are you loving? All that love me. “THE INFANT'S THREE SABBATHS.” Arranged to a native Indian air by the Rev. John Griffiths. Slumber, infant, slumber, On thy mother's breast; Kisses without number Rain upon thy rest— Well they come from many lips, But from her's the best, Slumber, infant, slumber, On thy mother's breast. Slumber, infant, slumber, On the earth's cold breast, Blossoms without number Bloom about thy rest. Nature, clad in all her smiles Greets so fair a guest, Slumber, infant, slumber, On the earth's cold breast. Slumber, infant, slumber On an angel's breast, Glories without number, Consecrate thy rest. Deeper joys than we can know Wait upon the blest, Slumber, infant, slumber, On an angel's breast. THE OLD MANORIAL HALL. To the air of the “Old English Gentleman.” When she was born I had been long the gardener of the Hall, The shrubs I planted with my hand were rising thick and tall; My heart was in that work and place, and little thought or care Had I of other living things than grew and flourished there, Beneath the happy shelter of The old Manorial Hall. At first she came a rosy child, a queen among my flowers, And played beside me while I worked, and prattled on for hours; And many a morning, in the plot of ground she called her own, She found an unexpected show of blossoms freshly blown, And sent her merry echoes through The old Manorial Hall. Thus fifteen summers, every day, I tended her and them I watched the opening of the bud, the shooting of the stem; And when her childly laughter turned to silent maiden smiles, I felt in Heaven whene'er she passed, and scarce on earth the whiles. How could I ever think to leave The old Manorial Hall! One day when Autumn's last delights were nipped by early cold, It fell like Death upon mine ear that she was bought and sold;— That some rich lord she hardly knew, had come to bear away The pride of all the country round—the poor man's hope and stay— The Glory and the Darling of The old Manorial Hall. I heard her plight to him the troth she could not understand, I saw her weeping turn her head and wave her parting hand; And from that hour no thing has gone with me but wrong, And soon I left the Garden and the Home I loved so long: It was a haunted house to me, That old Manorial Hall. And now I wander up and down, I labour as I can, Without a wish for rest or friends, a sorry-hearted man; Yet at the bottom of my thoughts the saddest lies, that she, With all her wealth and noble state, may none the happier be Than I, the poor old Gardener of The old Manorial Hall. THE BROOK-SIDE. I wandered by the brook-side, I wandered by the mill,— I could not hear the brook flow, The noisy wheel was still; There was no burr of grasshopper, No chirp of any bird, But the beating of my own heart Was all the sound I heard. I sat beneath the elm-tree, I watched the long, long, shade, And as it grew still longer, I did not feel afraid; For I listened for a footfall, I listened for a word,— But the beating of my own heart Was all the sound I heard. He came not,—no, he came not,— The night came on alone,— The little stars sat one by one, Each on his golden throne; The evening air passed by my cheek, The leaves above were stirr'd,— But the beating of my own heart Was all the sound I heard. Fast silent tears were flowing, When something stood behind,— A hand was on my shoulder, I knew its touch was kind: It drew me nearer—nearer,— We did not speak one word, For the beating of our own hearts Was all the sound we heard. 1830. ONCE. She never loved but once, And then her love did seem Like the opening of the tomb Or the weaving of a dream;— A premature betrothing To immortal things,— A momentary clothing With an angel's wings. She never loved but once, And then she learnt to feel The wounds that Love inflicts, That love alone can heal: For as that light of life Slowly faded by, She calmed her spirit's strife, In her wish to die; Yet lived, and Memory drew Some joy from all the pain— Her heart was kind to all But never loved again. She bid it cease to beat, Till in yon skies above, Love with Love should meet, First and only Love! SONG OF THOUGHTS. Let the lays from poet-lips Shadow forth the speech of heaven,— Let melodious airs eclipse All delight to senses given; Yet to these my notes and words Listen with your heart alone, While the Thought that best accords Makes a music of its own. Ye that in the fields of Love Feel the breath and bloom of spring, While I sing, securely rove,— Rest in safety, while I sing. Ye that gaze with vain regret Back towards that holy ground, All the world between forget, Spirit-rocked from sound to sound. All indifference, all distrust, From old friendships pass away! Let the faces of the just Shine as in God's perfect day! Fix the faintest, fleetest, smile, E'er athwart your path has gleam'd,— Take the charm without the wile,— Be the Beauty all it seem'd! 'Mid the flowers you love the best, Summer pride or vernal boon— By your favourite light caressed, Blush of eve or glow of noon,— Blend the strains of happiest days With the voices held most dear; Children cast on weary ways! Rest in peace and pleasaunce here. Be the Future's glorious page In my tones to youth revealed; Let the ruffled brow of age With eternal calm be sealed; High as Heaven's etherial cope, Wide as Light's rejoicing ray, Thoughts of memory! Thoughts of hope! Wander, wander, while ye may. THE OLD MAN'S SONG. Age is not a thing to measure By the course of moon or star; Time's before us—at our pleasure We may follow near or far: Strength and Beauty he has given, They are his to take away, But the Heart that well has striven Is no slave of night or day. See upon yon mountain-ridges How the fir-woods, spread between, Reconcile the snow-clad edges With the valley's vernal green; So the lines of grave reflection, You decipher on my brow, Keep my age in glad connexion With the young that flourish now. Not that now poetic fire Can along my life-strings run, As when my Memnonian lyre Welcomed every rising sun; Though my heart no more rejoices In the flashes of my brain, In the freshness of your voices Let me hear my songs again. Did I love?—let Nature witness, Conscious of my tears and truth; Do I love?—O fatal fitness! Still requiring youth for youth! Yet, while thought the bliss remembers, All delight is not gone by; Warm your spirits o'er my embers, Friends! and learn to love as I. O my children! O my brothers! If for self I lived too much, Be my pleasures now for others, Every passion now be such: Be the chillness life-destroying, That could make me slow to feel, To enjoy with your enjoying, To be zealous with your zeal. Grant me not, ye reigning Hours Virtues that beseem the young, Vigour for my failing powers, Music for my faltering tongue: Let me, cheerful thoughts retaining, Live awhile, nor fear to die, Ever new affections gaining, Such as Heaven might well supply. June, 1843. NARRATIVE POEMS. THE FALL OF ALIPIUS. From the Confessions of St. Augustin. When gentle Gratian ruled the Roman west, And with unvigorous virtues thought to hold That troubled balance in perpetual rest, And crush with good intent the bad and bold, The youth Alipius for the first time saw The Mother of civility and law. Mother in truth, but yet as one who now By her disloyal children tended ill Should sit apart, with hand upon her brow, Moaning her sick desires and feeble will; So Rome was pictured to the subtler eye, That could through words the soul of things descry. But no such vision of the truth had He Who with full heart passed under the old wall A Roman moulded by that sun and sea Which lit and laved the infant Hannibal, One who with Afric blood could still combine The civic memories of a Roman line. To him was Rome whatever she had been, Republican, Cesarean, unforgot, As much the single undisputed Queen, As if the Empire of the East was not,— Fine gold and rugged iron fused and cast Into one image of the glorious Past: And on a present throne to heaven up-piled, Of arches, temples, basilics and halls, He placed his Idol, while before her filed Nations to gild and glut her festivals; And of her might the utterance was so loud, That every other living voice was cowed. Possessed by this idea, little heed At first he gave the thickening multitude, That met and passed him in their noisy speed, Like hounds intent upon the scent of blood, For all the City was that day astir, Tow'ard the huge Flavian Amphitheatre. Yet soon his sole attention grew to scan That edifice whose walls might rather seem The masonry of Nature than of man, In size and figure a Titanic dream, That could whole worlds of lesser men absorb Within the embrace of one enormous orb. The mighty tragedies of skill and strife, That there in earnest death must ever close, Exciting palates which no tastes of life Could to a sense of such delight dispose, Swept by his fancy with an hundred names, The pomps and pageantries of Roman games. Why should he not pass onward with that tide Of passionate enchantment? why not share The seeds of pleasure Nature spread so wide, And gave the heart of men like common air? Why should that be to him a shame and sin, Which thousands of his fellows joy'd to win? But ere this thought could take perspicuous form, His Will arose and fell'd it at a blow; For he had felt that instinct's fever-storm Lash his young blood to fury long ago,— And in the Circus had consumed away Of his best years how many' a wanton day! Till the celestial guardian of his soul Led him the great Augustin's voice to hear, And soon that better influence o'er him stole, A reverend master and companion dear, From whom he learnt in his provincial home Wisdom scarce utter'd in the schools of Rome: “How wide Humanity's potential range,— From Earth's abysses to serenest Heaven,— From the poor child of circumstance and change, By every wind of passion tossed and driven, To the established philosophic mind, The type and model of the thing designed: “And how this work of works in each is wrought, By no enthusiast leap to good from ill, But by the vigorous government of thought, The unrelaxing continence of will,— Where little habits their invisible sway Extend, like body's growth, from day to day.” By meditations such as these sustained He stoutly breasted that on-coming crowd, Then, as in stupor, at one spot remained, For thrice he heard his name repeated loud, And close before him there beheld in truth Three dearest comrades of his Afric youth. O joy! to welcome in a stranger land Our homeliest native look and native speech, To feel that in one pressure of the hand There is a world of sympathy for each; And if old friendliness be there beside, The meeting is of bridegroom and of bride. What questions asked that waited not reply! What mirthful comment on apparent change! Till the three raised one gratulating cry,— “Arrived just then! how fortunate,—how strange! Arrived to see what they ne'er saw before, The fight between the Daunian and the Moor. “One graceful-limbed and lofty as a palm, The other moulded like his mountain-pine; Each with his customed arms content and calm, In his own nation each of princely line,— Two natures separate as the sun and snow Battling to death to make a Roman show!”— —Alipius, with few words and earnest mien, Answered, “That he long since had stood apart From those ferocious pleasures, and would wean Those whom he loved from them with all his heart, Yet, as his counsel could have little power, Where should they meet the morrow,—at what hour?” Their shafts of mockery from his virtuous head Fell to the ground,—so, using ruder might, Amid applauding bystanders, they said, “They would divert him in his own despite,” And bore him forward, while in fearless tone He cried, “my mind and sight are still mine own.” His body a mere dead-weight in their hands, His angry eyes in proud endurance closed, They placed him where spectators from all lands In eager expectation sat disposed, While in the distance still, before, behind, The people gathering were as rushing wind: Which ever rising grew into a storm Of acclamations, when, at either end, The combatant displayed his perfect form, Brandished his arms, rejoicing to expend His life in fight at least,—at least reclaim A warrior's privilege from a captive's shame. As rose before Amphion's notes serene The fated City of heroic guilt, Alipius thus his soul and sense between Imagination's strong defence up-built, With soft memorial music, dreamy strains Of youthful happinesses, loves, and pains. His stony seat seems on the Libyan coast,— Augustin on one side, and on the other Monica, for herself beloved, yet most By him regarded as Augustin's mother; And from far off resounds the populous roar As but the billows booming on the shore. Never can he desert the truth he drew From those all-honoured lips,—never can yield To savage appetite, and fresh imbrue That soul in filth to which had been revealed The eternal purities that round it lie, The Godhead of its birth and destiny. —Now trumpets clanging forth the last command Gave place to one tremendous pause of sound, Silence like that of some rich-flowering land With lava-torrents raging underground, Scarce for one moment safe from such outbreak As shall all nature to its centre shake. And soon in truth it came;—the first sharp blows Fell at long intervals as aimed with skill, Then grew expressive of the passion-throes That followed calm resolve and prudent will,— Till wild ejaculations took their part In the death-strife of hand and eye and heart. “Habet,—Hoc habet,—Habet!” He is hit—he has got it! What a cry! As if the Circus were one mighty mouth Invading the deep vale of quiet sky With avalanche melted in the summer-drouth,— Articulate tumult from old earth upborne, Delight and ire and ecstasy and scorn! Sat then Alipius silent there alone, With fast shut eyes and spirit far away? Remained he there as stone upon the stone, While the flushed conqueror asked the sign to slay The stricken victim, who despairing dumb Waited the sentence of the downward thumb? The shock was too much for him—too, too strong For that poor Reason and self-resting Pride; And every evil fury that had long Lain crouching in his breast leaped up and cried “Yield, yield at once, and do as others do, We are the Lords of all of them and you.” The Love of contest and the Lust of blood Dwell in the depths of man's original heart, And at mere shows and names of wise and good Will not from their barbaric homes depart, But half-sleep await their time, and then Bound forth, like tigers from their jungle-den. And all the curious wicker-work of thought, Of logical result and learnèd skill, Of precepts with examples inter-wrought, Of high ideals, and determinate will,— The careful fabric of ten thousand hours, Is crushed beneath the moment's brutal powers. Thus fell Alipius! He, so grave and mild, Added the bloody sanction of his hand To the swift slaughter of that brother-child Of his own distant Mauritanian land, Seeming content his very life to merge In the confusion of that foaming surge. The rage subsided; the deep sandy floor Sucked the hot blood; the hook, like some vile prey, Dragged off the noble body of the Moor; The Victor, doomed to die some other day, Enjoyed the plaudits purposelessly earned,— And back Alipius to himself returned. There is a fearful waking unto woes, When sleep arrests her charitable course, Yet far more terrible the line that flows From ebrious passion to supine remorse; Then welcome death,—but that the sufferers feel Wounds such as theirs no death is sure to heal! But the demoniac power that well can use Self-trust and Pride as instruments of ill, Can such prostration to its ends abuse, And poison from Humility distil: “Why struggle more? Why strive, when strife is vain, —An infant's muscles with a giant's chain?” So in his own esteem debased, and glad To take distraction whencesoe'er it came, Though in his heart of hearts entirely sad, Alipius lived to pleasure and to fame Alipius was appointed Assessor of Justice to the treasurer of Italy. Sometimes remindful of his youth's high vow, Of hopes and aspirations, fables now. When came to Rome his sire of moral lore, That Master, whom his love could ne'er forget, He too a proud Philosopher no more, He too his past reviewing with regret, But preaching One, who can on man bestow Truth to be wise and strength to keep him so. The secret of that strength the Christian sage To his regained disciple there unsealed, Giving his stagnant soul a war to wage With weapons that at once were sword and shield; And thenceforth ever down Tradition glide Augustin and Alipius side by side They went together to Milan, where they were both baptised by St. Ambrose on Easter Eve, A.D. 387. Thence they returned to Africa, and lived in monastic community in their native town of Tagaste. Alipius afterwards removed to Hippo, and visited St. Jerome in Palestine: he was consecrated Bishop of Tagaste, A.D. 393: his festival is kept in the Roman Catholic Church on the 15th of August. And in this strength years afterward arose That aged priest Telemachus, who cast His life among those brutalising shows, And died a willing victim and the last, Leaving that temple of colossal crime In silent battle with almighty Time. THE DEPARTURE OF ST. PATRICK FROM SCOTLAND. FROM HIS OWN “CONFESSIONS.” Twice to your son already has the hand of God been shown, Restoring him from alien bonds to be once more your own, And now it is the self-same hand, dear kinsmen, that to-day Shall take me for the third time from all I love away. While I look into your eyes, while I hold your hands in mine, What force could tear me from you, if it were not all divine? Has my love ever faltered? Have I ever doubted yours? And think you I could yield me now to any earthly lures? I go not to some balmier land in pleasant ease to rest,— I go not to content the pride that swells a mortal breast,— I go about a work my God has chosen me to do; Surely the soul which is his child must be his servant too. I seek not the great City where our sacred father dwells,— I seek not the blest Eremites within their sandy cells,— I seek not the Redeemer's grave in distant Palestine,— Another, shorter pilgrimage, a lonelier path is mine. When sunset clears and opens out the breadth of western sky, To those who in yon mountain isles protect their flocks on high Loom the dark outlines of a land, whose nature and whose name Some have by harsh experience learned, and all by evil fame. Oh, they are wild and wanton men, such as the best will be, Who know no other gifts of God but to be bold and free, Who never saw how states are bound in golden bonds of law, Who never knew how strongest hearts are bent by holy awe. When first into their pirate hands I fell, a very boy, Skirting the shore from rock to rock in unsuspecting joy, I had been taught to pray, and thus those slavish days were few, A wondrous hazard brought me back to liberty and you. But when again they met me on the open ocean field, And might of numbers pressed me round and forced my arm to yield, I had become a man like them, a selfish man of pride, I could have cursed the will of God for shame I had not died. And still this torment haunted me three weary years, until That summer night,—among the sheep,—upon the seaward hill, When God of his miraculous grace, of his own saving thought, Came down upon my lonely heart and rested unbesought! That night of light! I cared not that the day-star glimmered soon, For in my new-begotten soul it was already noon; I knew before what Christ had done, but never felt till then A shadow of the love for him that he had felt for men! Strong faith was in me,—on the shore there lay a stranded boat, I hasted down, I thrust it out, I felt it rock afloat; With nervous arm and sturdy oar I sped my watery way, The wind and tide were trusty guides,—one God had I and they. As one from out the dead I stood among you free and whole, My body Christ could well redeem, when he had saved my soul; And perfect peace embraced the life that had been only pain, For Love was shed upon my head from everthing, like rain. Then on so sweetly flowed the time, I almost thought to sail Even to the shores of Paradise in that unwavering gale, When something rose and nightly stood between me and my rest, Most like some one, beside myself, reflecting in my breast. I cannot put it into words, I only know it came, A sense of self-abasing weight, intolerable shame, “That I should be so vile that not one tittle could be paid Of that enormous debt which Christ upon my sould had laid!” This yielded to another mood, strange objects gathered near, Phantoms that entered not by eye, and voices not by ear, The land of my injurious thrall a gracious aspect wore, I yearned the most toward the forms I hated most before. I seemed again upon that hill, as on that blissful night, Encompassed with celestial air and deep retiring light, But sight and thought were fettered down, where glimmering lay below A plain of gasping, struggling, men in every shape of woe. Faint solemn whispers gathered round, “Christ suffered to redeem, Not you alone, but such as these, from this their savage dream,— Lo, here are souls enough for you to bring to him, and say, These are the earnest of the debt I am too poor to pay.” A cloud of children freshly born, innumerable bands, Passed by me with imploring eyes and little lifted hands, And all the Nature, I believed so blank and waste and dumb, Became instinct with life and love, and echoed clearly “Come!” “Amen!” said I; with eager steps a rude descent I tried, And all the glory followed me like an on-coming tide, With trails of light about my feet I crossed the darkling wild, And, as I touched each sufferer's hand, he rose and gently smiled. Thus night on night the vision came, and left me not alone, Until I swore that in that land should Christ be preached and known, And then at once strange coolness passed on my long fever'd brow, As from the flutter of light wings: I feel, I feel it now! And from that moment unto this, this last and proving one, I have been calm and light at heart as if the deed were done; I never thought how hard it was our earthly loves to lay Upon the altar of the Lord, and watch them melt away! Speak, friends! speak what you will,—but change those asking looks forlorn, —Sustain me with reproachful words,—uphold me with your scorn: —I know God's heart is in me, but my human bosom fears Those drops that pierce it as they fall, those full and silent tears. These comrades of my earliest youth have pledged their pious care To bear me to the fronting coast, and gently leave me there: It may be I shall fall at once, with little toil or need,— Heaven often takes the simple will for the most perfect deed: Or, it may be that from that hour beneath my hand may spring A line of glories unachieved by hero, sage, or king;— That Christ may glorify himself in this ignoble name. And shadow forth my endless life in my enduring fame. —All as He wills! Now bless me, mother,—your cheek is almost dry:— Farewell, kind brothers!—only pray ye may be blest as I: Smile on me, sisters!—when death comes near each of you, still smile, And we shall meet again somewhere, within a little while! BERTRAND DU GUESCLIN. A BRETON BALLAD. I. 'Twas on the field of Navarrète, When Trestamare had sought From English arms a safe retreat, Du Guesclin stood and fought: And to the brave Black Prince alone He yielded up his sword;— So we must sing in mournful tone, Until it be restored;— CHORUS. Spin, spin, maidens of Brittany, And let not your Litany Come to an end, Before you have prayed The Virgin to aid Bertrand du Guesclin, our Hero and Friend. II. The Black Prince is a gentle knight; And bade Du Guesclin name What ransom would be fit and right For his renown and fame; “A question hard,”—says he, “yet since Hard Fortune on me frowns, I could not tell you less, good Prince, Than twenty thousand crowns.” CHORUS. Spin, spin, &amp;c. III. “Where find you all that gold, Sir Knight? I would not have you end Your days in sloth and undelight Away from home and friend:” “O Prince of generous heart and just! Let all your fears be stayed; For my twenty thousand crowns I trust To every Breton maid.” CHORUS. Spin, spin, &amp;c. IV. And he is not deceived, for we Will never let him pine In stranger towers beyond the sea, Like a jewel in the mine! No work but this shall be begun,— We will not rest or dream, Till twenty thousand crowns are spun Du Guesclin to redeem. CHORUS. Spin, spin, &amp;c. V. The Bride shall grudge the marriage morn, And feel her joy a crime; The mother shall wean her eldest-born A month before its time; No festal day shall idle by, No hour uncounted stand, The grandame in her bed shall die With the spindle in her hand: CHORUS. Spin, spin, women of Brittany, Nor let your Litany Come to an end, Before you have prayed The Virgin to aid Bertrand du Guesclin, our Hero and Friend. BRETON FAITH. A summer nightfall on a summer sea! From sandy ridges wildering o'er the deep, The wind's familiar under-song recalls The fishermen to duty, though that eve To unversed eyes their embarkation seem'd Rather a work of festival than toil. Women were there in gay precise attire, Girls at their skirts, and boys before at play, And many an infant sweet asleep on arm. Emulous which the first shall set his boat Free-floating from the clutches of deep sand, Men lean and strive, till one and two and all, Poised in descent, receive the leaping crews; And following close where leads the ripply way One craft of heavier freight and larger sail, Serene and silent as the horizon moon, That fair flotilla seeks the open main. Some little room of waters sever'd now Those seeming sons of peaceful industry From their diseased and desperate fatherland, That France, where reign'd and raged for many a year Madness, (the fearful reservoir of strength Which God will open, at his own high will, In men and nations,) so that very babes Would tear the mother-breast of ancient Faith To suck the bloody milk of Liberty. The Christian name was outcast there and then; For Power and Passion were the people's gods, And every one that worshipped not must die. The shore extended one thin glittering line, When, at the watched-for tinkling of a bell, Fast fall the sails, and round their captain-boat, Which rested steady as the waters would, Each other bent its own obedient prow, Making imperfect rays about a sun: Nor paused they long before great change of form Came o'er that centre. From the uncouth deck Rose a tall altar, 'broider'd curiously, With clear-outcarven crucifix i' the midst Of tapers, lambent in the gentle gale: Before it stood the reverend-robed Priest, Late a rude fisherman,—an awful head, Veteran in griefs and dangers more than years, Perchance not finely moulded, but as seen There upright to the illuminating moon, With silver halo rather than white hair, Beauteous exceedingly! So seem'd to feel The tender eyes then fixed on him, while slow And quiet, as when he perform'd the rites Of his old village church on Sabbath morn, He set all things in order and began That Litany, which, gathering voice on voice, Made vocal with the names of God and Christ, And the communion of the blest in heaven, Space that had lain long silent of all sound Save the chance greetings of some parting ships, And elemental utterances confused. Oh! never in high Roman basilic, Prime dome of Art, or elder Lateran, Mother of churches! never at the shrine That sprang the freshest from pure martyr-blood, Or held within its clasp a nation's heart By San Iago or Saint Denys blest,— Never in that least earthly place of earth, The Tomb where Death himself lay down and died, The Temple of Man's new Jerusalem,— Descended effluence more indeed divine, More total energy of Faith and Hope, And Charity for wrongs unspeakable, Than on that humble scantling of the flock, That midnight congregation of the Sea! Rise not, good Sun! hold back unwelcome Light, That shall but veil the nations in new crime! Or hide thy coming; yet some little while Prolong the stupor of exhausted sin, Nor with thy tainted rays disturb this peace, These hard-won fragmentary hours of peace, That soon must sink before the warring world! He hears them not; beneath his splendour fades That darkness luminous of Love and Joy; Quickly its aspect of base daily life The little fleet recovering plied in haste Its usual labour, lest suspicious foes Might catch some secret in those empty nets; But every one there toiling in his heart Was liken'd to those other Fishermen, Who on their inland waters saw the form Of Jesus toward them walking, firm and free. One moment yet, ere the religious Muse Fold up these earnest memories in her breast, Nor leave unutter'd that one Breton name Which is itself a History—Quiberon! Was it not heinous? was it not a shame Which goes beyond its actors, that those men, Simply adventuring to redeem their own— Their ravished homes, and shrines, and fathers' graves, Meeting that rampant and adulterous power On its own level of brute force, that they, Crushed by sheer numbers, should be made exempt From each humane and generous privilege, With which the civil use of later times Has smooth'd the bristling fierceness of old war, And perish armless,—one by one laid low By the cold sanction'd executioner! Nor this alone; for fervid love may say, That death to them, beneath the foulest hood, Would wear an aureole crown; and martyr-palms Have grown as freely from dry felon dust, As e'er from field enriched with fame and song, But when they asked the only boon brave men Could from inclement conquerors humbly pray— To die as men, and not fall blankly down Into steep death like butcher'd animals, But to receive from consecrated hands Those seals and sureties which the Christian soul Demands as covenants of eternal bliss,— They were encounter'd by contemptuous hate, And mockery, bitter as the crown of thorns. Thus passed that night, their farewell night to earth, Grave, even sad,—that should have been so full Of faith nigh realised, of young and old Met hand in hand, indifferent of all time, On the bright shores of immortality! Till 'mid the throng about their prison-door, In the grey dawn, a rustic voice conveyed Some broken message to a captive's ear, Low, and by cruel gaolers unperceived; Which whisper, flitting fast from man to man Was like a current of electric joy, Awakening smiles, and radiant upward looks, And interchange of symbols spiritual, Leaving unearthly peace. So when soon came The hour of doom, and through the palsied crowd Passed the long file without a word or sound, The image, gait, and bearing of each man, In those his bonds, in that his sorry dress, Defiled with dust and blood, perchance his own, A squalid shape of famine and unrest, Were that of some full-sail'd, magnificent ship, That takes the whole expanse of sea and air For its own service, dignifying both As accessories of its single pride. To read the sense and secret of this change, Look where beside the winding path that leads These noble warriors to ignoble death, Rises a knoll of white, grass-tufted, sand, Upon whose top, against the brightening sky, Stands a mean peasant, tending with one hand A heifer browsing on that scanty food. To the slow-moving line below he turns An indistinct, almost incurious, gaze, While with a long right arm upraised in air He makes strange gestures, source of ribald mirth To some, but unregarded by the most. —Yet could a mortal vision penetrate Each motion of that scene, it might perceive How every prisoner, filing by that spot, Bows his bold head, and walks with lighter steps Onward to rest but once and move no more: For in that peasant stands the yearned-for Priest, Perilling life by this last act of love, And in those gestures are the absolving signs, Which send the heroes to their morning graves Happy as parents' kisses duly speed Day-weary children to their careless beds. Such are memorials, and a hundred more, Which, by the pious traveller haply caught, Falling from lowly lips and lofty hearts, Regenerate outward nature, and adorn With blossoms brighter than the Orient rose, And verdure fresher than an English spring, The dull sand-hillocks of the Morbihan. THE DEATH OF SARSFIELD. When Ireland's cities, one by one, beneath the Orange brand, Fell overawed or overpowered and lost their noble land, Still Limerick, with her own strong arm and Sarsfield's leading will, Wasted the conqueror's gathered force and foiled his ready skill. Yet vain the strife when all was gone save honour and despair, When in three realms King James's flag was floating only there: Thus came the time when England's fleet three thousand warriors bore, Willing, yet sorrowing, banished hearts, to yon more friendly shore. There Sarsfield, now Earl Lucan named, devoted faith and sword To Him who for his exiled land had spread the royal board; Without a country or a king he knew no better law, Than serve the Grand Monarque, the foe of England and Nassau! Thus on the Neckar's bristling banks and by the blood-bought Rhine, Earl Lucan and his famed brigade would lead the gallant line; Though often came the grievous thought to close a well-won day, That others fought for fatherland,—for gold and glory they! Until before some sturdy fort that checked the Gallic pride, His comrades from the raining bolts one moment bent aside; And he, while rallying them to show “how glad they were to meet Those little friends they knew so well,” Historical.—fell stricken at their feet! The blood outspouting from his breast, they gently raised him up, With hollow hand he caught the stream and filled the living cup, Then slowly poured it on the ground, and, heavenward gazing, cried, “Oh God, that this were only shed for Ireland!”—and so died. Alas! we cannot even die for what we love the best; On things we feel are little worth we lavish toil and rest, While all, on which the hope of youth and faith of manhood beamed, Is doomed to perish by our love and sorrow unredeemed. PRINCE EMILIUS OF HESSEN-DARMSTADT. From Hessen-Darmstadt every step to Moskwa's blazing banks Was Prince Emilius found in fight before the foremost ranks; And when upon the icy waste that host was backward cast, On Beresina's bloody bridge his banner waved the last. His valour shed victorious grace on all that dread retreat, That path across the wildering snow, athwart the blinding sleet; And every follower of his sword could all endure and dare, Becoming warriors strong in hope or stronger in despair. Now, day and dark, along the storm the demon Cossacks sweep, The hungriest must not look for food, the weariest must not sleep; No rest, but death, for horse or man, whichever first shall tire;— They see the flames destroy but ne'er may feel the saving fire. Thus never closed the bitter night nor rose the savage morn, But from that gallant company some noble part was shorn, And, sick at heart, the Prince resolved to keep his purposed way, With stedfast forward looks, nor count the losses of the day. At length beside a black-burnt hut, an island of the snow,— Each head in frigid stupor bent toward the saddlebow,— They paused, and of that sturdy troop, that thousand banded men, At one unmeditated glance he numbered only ten! Of all that high triumphant life that left his German home, Of all those hearts that beat beloved or looked for love to come, This piteous remnant hardly saved his spirit overcame, While memory raised each friendly face and called each ancient name. Then were his words serene and firm—“Dear brothers it is best That here, with perfect trust in Heaven, we give our bodies rest; If we have borne, like faithful men, our part of toil and pain, Where'er we wake, for Christ's good sake, we shall not sleep in vain.” Some murmured, others looked, assent, they had no heart to speak; Dumb hands were pressed, the pallid lip approached the callous cheek; They laid them side by side; and death to him at least did seem To come attired in mazy robe of variegated dream. Once more he floated on the breast of old familiar Rhine, His mother's and one other smile above him seemed to shine; A blessèd dew of healing fell on every aching limb, Till the stream broadened and the air thickened, and all was dim. Nature has bent to other laws, if that tremendous night Passed o'er his frame exposed and worn and left no deadly blight; Then wonder not that when refreshed and warm he woke at last, There lay a boundless gulf of thought between him and the past. Soon raising his astonished head he found himself alone, Sheltered beneath a genial heap of vestments not his own; The light increased, the solemn truth revealing more and more,— His soldiers' corses self-despoiled closed up the narrow door. That very hour, fulfilling good, miraculous succour came, And Prince Emilius lived to give this worthy deed to fame. O brave fidelity in death! O strength of loving will! These are the holy balsam-drops that woful wars distil. THE TRAGEDY OF THE LAC DE GAUBE IN THE PYRENEES. The marriage blessing on their brows, Across the Channel seas And lands of gay Garonne, they reach The pleasant Pyrenees:— He into boyhood born again, A son of joy and life,— And she a happy English girl, A happier English wife. They loiter not where Argelés, The chesnut-crested plain, Unfolds its robe of green and gold In pasture, grape, and grain; But on and up, where Nature's heart Beats strong amid the hills, They pause, contented with the wealth That either bosom fills. There is a Lake, a small round Lake, High on the mountain's breast, The child of rains and melted snows, The torrent's summer rest,— A mirror where the veteran rocks May glass their peaks and scars, A nether sky where breezes break The sunlight into stars. Oh! gaily shone that little lake, And Nature, sternly fair, Put on a sparkling countenance To greet that merry pair; How light from stone to stone they leapt, How trippingly they ran; To scale the rock and gain the marge Was all a moment's span! “See, dearest, this primæval boat, So quaint, and rough, I deem Just such an one did Charon ply Across the Stygian stream: Step in,—I will your Charon be, And you a Spirit bold,— I was a famous rower once In college days of old. “The clumsy oar! the laggard boat! How slow we move along,— The work is harder than I thought,— A song, my love, a song!” Then, standing up, she carolled out So blithe and sweet a strain That the long-silent cliffs were glad To peal it back again. He, tranced in joy, the oar laid down, And rose in careless pride, And swayed in cadence to the song The boat from side to side: Then clasping hand in loving hand, They danced a childish round, And felt as safe in that mid-lake As on the firmest ground. One poise too much!—He headlong fell,— She, stretching out to save A feeble arm was borne adown Within that glittering grave:— One moment, and the gush went forth Of music-mingled laughter,— The struggling splash and deathly shriek Were there the instant after. Her weaker head above the flood, That quick engulfed the strong, Like some enchanted water-flower, Waved pitifully long:— Long seemed the low and lonely wail Athwart the tide to fade; Alas! that there were some to hear, But never one to aid. Yet not alas! if Heaven revered The freshly-spoken vow, And willed that what was then made one Should not be sundered now,— If She was spared, by that sharp stroke, Love's most unnatural doom, The future lorn and unconsoled, The unavoided tomb! But weep, ye very Rocks! for those, Who, on their native shore, Await the letters of dear news, That shall arrive no more; One letter from a stranger hand,— Few words are all the need; And then the funeral of the heart, The course of useless speed! The presence of the cold dead wood, The single mark and sign Of her so loved and beautiful, That handiwork divine! The weary search for his fine form That in the depth would linger, And late success,—Oh! leave the ring Upon that faithful finger. And if in life there lie the seed Of real enduring being; If love and truth be not decreed To perish unforeseeing; This Youth, the seal of death has stamped, Now time can wither never, This Hope, that sorrow might have damped, Is fresh and strong for ever. Mr. and Mrs. Patteson were drowned in the year 1831. A SPANISH ANECDOTE. It was a holy usage to record Upon each refectory's side or end The last mysterious Supper of our Lord, That meanest appetites might upward tend. Within the convent Palace of old Spain Rich with the gifts and monuments of Kings, Hung such a picture, said by some to reign The sovereign glory of those wondrous things. A Painter of far fame, Wilkie. in deep delight, Dwelt on each beauty he so well discerned, While, in low tones, a grey Geronomite This answer to his ecstasy returned. “Stranger! I have received my daily meal In this good company, now threescore years, And Thou, whoe'er Thou art, canst hardly feel How Time these lifeless images endears. “Lifeless,—ah! no: both Faith and Art have given That passing hour a life of endless rest, And every soul who loves the food of Heaven May to that table come a welcome guest: “Lifeless,—ah! no: while in mine heart are stored Sad memories of my brethren dead and gone, Familiar places vacant round our board, And still that silent Supper lasting on; “While I review my youth,—what I was then,— What I am now, and ye, beloved ones all! It seems as if these were the living men, And we the coloured shadows on the wall.” LEGENDS. A CHRISTMAS STORY. The windows and the garden door Must now be closed for night, And you, my little girl, no more Can watch the snow-flakes white Fall, like a silver net, before The face of dying light. Draw down the curtains every fold, Let not a gap let in the cold, Bring your low seat toward the fire, And you shall have your heart's desire; A story of that favourite book In which you often steal a look, Regretful not to understand Words of a distant time and land;— That small square book that seems so old In tawny white and faded gold, And which I could not leave to-day, Even with the snow and you to play.— It was on such a night as this, Six hundred years ago, The wind as loud and pitiless, As loaded with the snow, A night when you might start to meet A friend in an accustomed street, That a lone child went up and down The pathways of an ancient town. A little child, just such as you, With eyes, though clouded, just as blue, With just such long fine golden hair, But wet and rough for want of care, And just such tender tottering feet Bare to the cold and stony street. Alone! this fragile human flower, Alone! at this unsightly hour, A playful, joyful, peaceful form, A creature of delight, Become companion of the storm, And phantom of the night! No gentler thing is near,—in vain Its warm tears meet the frozen rain, No watchful ears await its cries On every name that well supplies The childly nature with a sense Of love and care and confidence; It looks before, it looks behind, And staggers with the weighty wind, Till, terror overpowering grief, And feeble as an autumn leaf, It passes down the tide of air, It knows not, thinks not, how or where. Beneath a carven porch, before An iron-belted oaken door, The tempest drives the cowering child, And rages on as hard and wild. This is not shelter, though the sleet Strikes heavier in the open street, For, to that infant ear, a din Of festive merriment within Comes, by the contrast, sadder far Than all the outer windy war, With something cruel, something curst, In each repeated laughter-burst; A thread of constant cheerful light, Drawn through the crevice on the sight, Tells it of heat it cannot feel, And all the fire-side bliss That home's dear portals can reveal On such a night as this. How can those hands so small and frail, Empassioned as they will, avail Against that banded wall of wood Standing in senseless hardihood Between the warmth and love and mirth, The comforts of the living earth, And the lorn creature shivering there, The plaything of the savage air? We would not, of our own good will, Believe in so much strength of ill, Believe that life and sense are given To any being under Heaven Only to weep and suffer thus, To suffer without sin What would be for the worst of us A bitter discipline. Yet now the tiny hands no more Are striking that unfeeling door; Folded and quietly they rest, As on a cherub's marble breast; And from the guileless lips of woe Are passing words confused and low, Remembered fragments of a prayer, Learned and repeated otherwhere, With the blue summer overhead, On a sweet mother's knee, Beside the downy cradle-bed, But always happily. Though for those holy words the storm Relaxes not its angry form, The child no longer stands alone Upon the inhospitable stone: There now are two,—one to the other Like as a brother to twin-brother, But the new-comer has an air Of something wonderful and rare, Something divinely calm and mild, Something beyond a human child: His eyes come through the thickening night With a soft planetary light, And from his hair there falls below A radiance on the drifting snow, And his untarnished childly bloom Seems but the brighter for the gloom. See what a smile of gentle grace Expatiates slowly o'er his face! As, with a mien of soft command, He takes that numbed and squalid hand, And with a voice of simple joy And greeting as from boy to boy, He speaks, “What do you at this door? Why called you not on me before? What like you best? that I should break This sturdy barrier for your sake, And let you in that you may share The warmth and joy and cheerful fare;— Or will you trust to me alone, And heeding not the windy moan Nor the cold rain nor lightning-brand, Go forward with me, hand in hand? Within this house, if e'er on earth, You will find love and peace and mirth; And there may rest for many a day, While I am on mine open way; And should your heart to me incline, When I am gone, Take you this little cross of mine To lean upon, And setting out what path you will, Careless of your own strength and skill, You soon will find me; only say, “What wish you most to do to-day?” The child looks out into the night, With gaze of pain and pale affright, Then turns an eye of keen desire On the thin gleam of inward fire, Then rests a long and silent while, Upon that brother's glorious smile. —You've seen the subtle magnet draw The iron by its hidden law, So seems that smile to lure along The child from an enclosing throng Of fears and fancies undefined, And to one passion fix its mind,— Till every struggling doubt to check And give to love its due, It casts its arms about his neck, And cries, “With you, with you,— For you have sung me many a song, Like mine own mother's, all night long, And you have play'd with me in dreams, Along the walks, beside the streams, Of Paradise,—the blessèd bowers, Where what men call the stars are flowers, And what to them looks deep and blue Is but a veil which we saw through, Into the garden without end, Where you the angel-children tend: So that they asked me when I woke, Where I had been, to whom I spoke, What I was doing there, to seem So heavenly-happy in my dream? Oh! take me, take me, there again, Out of the cold and wind and rain, Out of this dark and cruel town, Whose houses on the orphan frown; Bear me the thundering clouds above To the safe kingdom of your love: Or if you will not, I can go With you barefooted through the snow;— I shall not feel the bitter blast, If you will take me home at last.” Three kisses on its dead-cold cheeks,— Three on its bloodless brow,— And a clear answering music speaks, “Sweet brother! come there now: It shall be so; there is no dread Within the aureole of mine head; This hand in yours, this living hand, Can all the world of cold withstand, And, though so small, is strong to lift Your feet above the thickest drift; The wind that round you raged and broke Shall fold about us like a cloak, And we shall reach that garden soon, Without the guide of sun or moon.” So down the mansion's slippery stair, Into the midnight weather, Pass, as if sorrows never were, The weak and strong together. —This was the night before the morn, On which the Hope of Man was born, And long ere dawn can claim the sky, The tempest rolls subservient by; While bells on all sides sing and say, How Christ the child was born to-day; Free as the sun's in June, the rays Mix merry with the Yuhl-log's blaze; Some butterflies of snow may float Down slowly, glistening in the mote, But crystal-leaved and fruited trees Scarce lose a jewel in the breeze; Frost-diamonds twinkle on the grass, Transformed from pearly dew, And silver flowers encrust the glass, Which gardens never knew. The inmates of the house, before Whose iron-fended heedless door, The children of our nightly tale Were standing, rise refreshed and hale, And run, as if a race to win, To let the Christmas morning in. They find, upon the threshold stone, A little Child, just like their own; Asleep it seems, but when the head Is raised, it sleeps, as sleep the dead; The fatal point had touched it, while The lips had just begun a smile, The forehead 'mid the matted tresses A perfect-painless end expresses, And, unconvulsed, the hands may wear The posture more of thanks than prayer. They tend it straight in wondering grief,— And, when all skill brings no relief, They bear it onward, in its smile, Up the Cathedral's central aisle: There, soon as Priests and People heard How the thing was, they speak not word, But take the usual Image, meant The blessèd babe to represent, Forth from its cradle, and instead Lay down that silent mortal head. Now incense-cloud and anthem-sound Arise the beauteous body round; Softly the carol chant is sung, Softly the mirthful peal is rung, And, when the solemn duties end, With tapers earnest troops attend The gentle corpse, nor cease to sing, Till, by an almond tree, They bury it, that the flowers of spring May o'er it soonest be. THE BROWNIE. A gentle household Spirit, unchallenged and unpaid, Attended with his service a lonely servant-maid. She seemed a weary woman, who had found life unkind, Whose youth had left her early and little left behind. Most desolate and dreary her days went on until Arose this unseen stranger her labours to fulfil. But now she walked at leisure, secure of blame she slept, The meal was always ready, the room was always swept. And by the cheerful fire-light, the winter evenings long, He gave her words of kindness and snatches of sweet song;— With useful housewife secret and tales of faeries fair, From times when gaunt magicians and dwarfs and giants were;— Thus, habit closing round her, by slow degrees she nurst A sense of trust and pleasure, where she had feared at first. When strange desire came on her, and shook her like a storm, To see this faithful being distinct in outward form. He was so pure a nature, of so benign a will, It could be nothing fearful, it could be nothing ill. At first with grave denial her prayer he laid aside, Then warning and entreaty, but all in vain, he tried. The wish upgrew to passion,—she urged him more and more,— Until, as one outwearied, but still lamenting sore, He promised in her chamber he would attend her call, When from the small high window the full-moon light should fall. Most proud and glad that evening she entered to behold How there her phantom Lover his presence would unfold; When, lo! in bloody pallor lay, on the moonlit floor, The Babe she bore and murdered some thirteen years before. VENUS AND THE CHRISTIAN KNIGHT. “Why are thine eyes so red, Sir Knight, And why thy cheek so pale? Thou tossest to and fro all night, Like a ship without a sail.” The Knight rose up, and answered quick: “Too long in lust I lie, And now my heart is pleasure-sick; I must go hence, or die. “I must go hence, and strive to win, By penitential tears, God's pardon for the shame and sin Of these luxurious years. “No man his life can rightly keep Apart from toil and pain; I would give all these joys, to weep My youth's sweet tears again!” “I will not let thee go, Sir Knight; But I will make thee new Untold devices of delight, That shall thy soul imbue; “And thou, these sickly thoughts defy, Undo these vain alarms; What God can give thee more than I,— More Heaven than in mine arms?” “Venus! I fear thy wanton heart, I fear thy glittering eyes; I shrink and tremble, lest thou art A demon in disguise.” With high disdain the Ladie strove, Then uttered, sad and low, “Oh! hard return for so much love! Ungrateful mortal! go.” The Knight, with none to check or meet, Thus left the marble dome; And soon his weary, wounded, feet Were near the gates of Rome. There, where imperial Tiber flows, Pope Urban rode along; And “Kyrie Eleison,” rose From all the thickening throng. “Thou that hast power to stay God's wrath, And darkest souls to shrive, Stop, holy Father! on thy path, And save a soul alive. “For I, a noble Christian Knight, Have served, for many a year, In dalliance of impure delight, A demon, as I fear. “If Venus sooth a demon be, As thou hast skill to tell, God's face how shall I ever see, How shun the deep of hell?” —“Too well that fiend, and all her power, Most hapless man! I know; If thou hast been her paramour, No grace can I bestow. “I could the demon's self assoil, As well as pardon thee; Thy body hath been her willing spoil, Thy soul must be her fee! “For sooner shall this peelèd staff Put out both leaf and bloom, Than God shall strike thy sentence off His dreadful book of doom!” The Knight his feeble knee upraised, Past weeping through the crowd; And some in silent pity gazed, And some with horror loud. “Then shall I never, never, see Thy countenance divine, Jesus! that died in vain for me,— Sweet Mary, mother! thine?” Now forth this child of woe had gone Full fourteen days, when, lo! The staff the Pope laid hand upon Began to bud and blow: Green leaves, and flowers of perfect white, The very growth of heaven;— Sure witness to that wretched Knight Of all his sins forgiven! Oh! far and wide, o'er earth and tide, Swift messengers are sped, To hail the sinner justified, The late devoted head. In vain—in vain! Straight back again He bent his hopeless way,— And Venus shall her Knight retain, Until God's judgment-day. Mysterious end of good remorse! Strong lesson to beware, Ye priests of mercy! how ye force Poor sinners to despair. THE NORTHERN KNIGHT IN ITALY. This is the record, true as his own word, Of the adventures of a Christian knight, Who, when beneath the foul Karasmian sword At the conclusion of the last crusade. God's rescued city sunk to hopeless night, Desired, before he gain'd his northern home, To soothe his wounded heart at Holy Rome. And having found, in that reflected heaven, More than Cæsarean splendours and delights, So that it seemed to his young sense was given An unimagined world of sounds and sights;— Yet, half regretful of the long delay, He joined some comrades on their common way. The Spring was mantling that Italian land, The Spring! the passion-season of our earth, The joy, whose wings will never all expand,— The gladsome travail of continuous birth,— The force that leaves no creature unimbued With amorous Nature's bland inquietude. Though those hard sons of tumult and bold life, Little as might be, own'd the tender power, And only show'd their words and gestures rife With the benign excitement of the hour,— Yet one, the one of whom this tale is told, In his deep soul was utterly controll'd. New thoughts sprung up within him,—new desires Opened their panting bosoms to the sun; Imagination scattered lights and fires O'er realms before impenetrably dun; His senses, energized with wondrous might, Mingled in lusty contest of delight. The once-inspiring talk of steel and steeds And famous captains lost its ancient zest; The free recital of illustrious deeds Came to him vapid as a thrice-told jest; His fancy was of angels penance-bound To convoy sprites through heavenly ground. The first-love vision of those azure eyes, Twin stars that blessed and kept his spirit cool, Down-beaming from the brazen Syrian skies, Now seem'd the spectral doting of a fool,— Unwelcome visitants that stood between Him and the livelier glories of the scene. What wanted he with such cold monitors? What business had he with the past at all? Well, in the pauses of those clamorous wars, Such dull endearment might his heart enthral, But, in this universe of blissful calm, He had no pain to need that homely balm. Occasion, therefore, in itself though slight He made of moment to demand its stay, Where some rare houses, in the clear white light, Like flakes of snow among the verdure lay; And bade the company give little heed, He would o'ertake them by redoubled speed. But now at length resolved to satisfy The appetite of beauty, and repair Those torpid years which he had let glide by, Unconscious of the powers of earth and air, He rested, roved, and rested while he quafft The deepest richness of the sunny draught. Eve after eve he told his trusty band They should advance straight northward on the morrow, Yet when he rose, and to that living land Addressed his farewell benison of sorrow, With loveliest aspect Nature answer'd so, It seem'd almost impiety to go. Thus days were gather'd into months, and there He linger'd, sauntering without aim or end: Not unaccompanied; for wheresoe'er His steps, through wood, or glen, or field, might tend,— A bird-like voice was ever in his ear, Divinely sweet and rapturously clear. A bird is by no means an uncommon actor in a drama of this kind. It is recorded that, at the Council of Basle, three pious doctors were wont to walk out daily and discuss points of deep theology, but that, as soon as the song of a certain nightingale reached their ears, their argument was inevitably confused; they contradicted themselves, drew false conclusions, and were occasionally very near falling into heresy. The thought struck one of them to exorcise the nightingale, and the devil flew visibly out of a bush, and left the disputants at peace. See also the beautiful story of “The Monk and Bird,” in Mr. Trench's poems. From the pinaster's solemn-tented crown,— From the fine olive spray that cuts the sky,— From bare or flowering summit, floated down That music unembodied to the eye: Sometime beside his feet it seemed to run, Or fainted, lark-like, in the radiant sun. Soon as this mystic sound attained his ear, Barriers arose, impermeable, between Him and the two wide worlds of hope and fear;— His life entire was in the present scene; The passage of each day he only knew By the broad shadows and the deepening blue. His senses by such ecstasy possest, He chanced to climb a torrent's slippery side, And, on the utmost ridge refusing rest, Took the first path his eager look descried; And paused, as one outstartled from a trance, Within a place of strange significance. A ruin'd temple of the Pagan world,— Pillars and pedestals with rocks confused,— Art back into the lap of nature hurl'd, And still most beautiful, when most abused; A Paradise of pity, that might move Most careless hearts, unknowingly, to love! A very garden of luxurious weeds, Hemlock in trees, acanthine leaves outspread, Flowers here and there, the growth of wind-cast seeds, With vine and ivy draperies overhead; And by the access, two nigh-sapless shells, Old trunks of myrtle, haggard sentinels! Amid this strife of vigour and decay An Idol stood, complete, without a stain, Hid by a broad projection from the sway Of winter gusts and daily-rotting rain. Time and his agents seem'd alike to spare A thing so unimaginably fair. By what deep memory or what subtler mean Was it, that at the moment of this sight, The actual past—the statue and the scene, Stood out before him in historic light? He knew the glorious image by its name— Venus! the Goddess of unholy fame. He heard the tread of distant generations Slowly defiling to their place of doom; And thought how men, and families, and nations Had trusted in the endless bliss and bloom Of Her who stood in desolation there, Now lorn of love and unrevered prayer. Beauty without an eye to gaze on it, Passion without a breast to lean upon, Feelings unjust, unseemly, and unfit, Troubled his spirit's high and happy tone; So back with vague imaginative pain He turned the steps that soon returned again. For there henceforth he every noon reposed In languor self-sufficient for the day, Feeling the light within his eyelids closed, Or peeping, where the locusts, like a ray, Shot through its crevice, and, without a sound, The insect hosts enjoyed their airy round. Day-dreams give sleep, and sleep brings dreams anew; Thus oft a face of untold tenderness, A cloud of woe with beauty glistening through, Brooded above him in divine distress,— And sometimes bowed so low, as it would try His ready lips, then vanished with a sigh: And round him flowed through that intense sunshine Music, whose notes at once were words and tears; “Paphos was mine, and Amathus was mine, Mine were the Idalian groves of ancient years,— The happy heart of Man was all mine own, Now I am homeless and alone—alone!” At other times, to his long-resting gaze, Instinct with life the solid sculpture grew, And rose transfigured, 'mid a golden haze, Till lost within the impermeable blue; Yet ever, though with liveliest hues composed, Sad-swooning sounds the apparition closed. As the strong waters fill the leaky boat And suck it downwards, by unseen degrees;— So sunk his soul, the while it seemed to float On that serene security of ease, Into a torpid meditative void, By the same fancies that before upbuoyed. His train, though wondering at their changeful lord, Had no distaste that season to beguile With mimic contests and well-furnished board,— And even he would sometimes join awhile Their sports, then turn, as if in scorn, away From such rude commerce and ignoble play. One closing eve, thus issuing forth, he cried, “Land of my love! in thee I cast my lot;— Till death thy faithful subject I abide,— Home, kindred, country, knighthood, all forgot,— Names that I heed no more, while I possess Thy heartfelt luxury of loveliness!” That summer night had all the healthy cool That nerves the spirit of the youthful year; Yet, as to eyes long fixed on a deep pool, The waters dark and bright at once appear, So, through the freshness on his senses soon Came the warm memories of the lusty noon. Such active pleasure tingling through his veins, Quicken'd his pace beneath the colonnade, Chesnut, and ilex—to the moonèd plains A bronze relief and garniture of shade,— When, just before him, flittingly, he heard The tender voice of that familiar bird. Holding his own, to catch that sweeter breath, And listening, so that each particular sound Was merged in that attention's depth, his path Into the secret of the forest wound; The clear-drawn landscape, and the orb's full gaze, Gave place to dimness and the wild-wood's maze. That thrilling sense, which to the weak is fear, Becomes the joy and guerdon of the brave; So, trusting his harmonious pioneer, His heart he freely to the venture gave, And through close brake, and under pleachèd aisle, Walked without sign of outlet many a mile. When, turning round a thicket weariedly, A building, of such mould as well might pass From graceful Greece to conquering Italy, Rose in soft outline from the silver'd grass, Whose doors thrown back and inner lustre show'd It was no lorn and tenantless abode. Children of all varieties of fair, And gaily vested, cluster'd round the portal, Until one Boy, who had not mien and air Of future manhood, but of youth immortal, Within an arch of light, came clear to view, Descending that angelic avenue. “Stranger! the mistress of this happy bower,” Thus the bright messenger the knight addrest— “Bids us assert her hospitable power, And lead thee in a captive or a guest; Rest is the mate of night,—let opening day Speed the rejoicing on thy work and way.” Such gentle bidding might kind answer earn; The full moon's glare put out each guiding star; He summ'd the dangers of enforc'd return, And now first marvell'd he had roved so far: Then murmur'd glad acceptance, tinged with fear, Lest there unmeet his presence should appear. Led by that troop of youthful innocence, A hall he traversed, up whose heaven-topt dome Thick vapours of delightful influence From gold and alabastar altars clomb, And through a range of pillar'd chambers past, Each one more full of faerie than the last. To his vague gaze those peopled walls disclosed Graces and grandeurs more to feel than see,— Celestial and heroic forms composed In many a frame of antique poesy; But, wheresoe'er the scene or tale might fall, Still Venus was the theme and crown of all. There young Adonis scorn'd to yield to her, Soon by a sterner nature overcome; There Paris, happy hapless arbiter, For beauty barter'd kingdom, race, and home; Save what Æneas rescued by her care, As the Didonian wood-nymph pictured there. But ere he scanned them long, a Lady enter'd, In long white robes majestical array'd, Though on her face alone his eyes were centred, Which weird suspicion to his mind convey'd, For every feature he could there divine Of the old marble in the sylvan shrine. On his bewilderment she gently smiled, To his confusion she benignly spoke; And all the fears that started up so wild Lay down submissive to her beauty's yoke: It was with him as if he saw through tears A countenance long-loved and lost for years. She asked, “if so he will'd,” the stranger's name, And, when she heard it, said, “the gallant sound Had often reached her on the wing of fame, Though long recluse from fortune's noisy round; Her lot was cast in loneliness, and yet On noble worth her woman-heart was set.” Rare is the fish that is not meshed amain, When Beauty tends the silken net of praise; Thus little marvel that in vaunting strain He spoke of distant deeds and brave affrays, Till each self-glorious thought became a charm, For her to work against him to his harm. Such converse of melodious looks and words Paused at the call of other symphonies, Invisible agencies that draw the cords Of massive curtains, rising as they rise, So that the music's closing swell reveal'd The Paradise of pleasure there conceal'd. It was a wide alcove, thick-wall'd with flowers, Gigantic blooms, of aspect that appear'd Beyond the range of vegetative powers, A flush of splendour almost to be fear'd, A strange affinity of life between Those glorious creatures and that garden's Queen. Luminous gems were weaving from aloft Fantastic rainbows on the fountain spray,— Cushions of broider'd purple, silken-soft, Profusely heaped beside a table lay, Whereon all show of form and hue increast The rich temptation of the coming feast. There on one couch, and served by cherub hands, The Knight and Lady banqueted in joy: With freshest fruits from scarce discover'd lands, Such as he saw in pictures when a boy, And cates of flavours excellent and new, That to the unpalled taste still dearer grew. Once, and but once, a spasm of very fear Went through him, when a breeze of sudden cold Sigh'd, like a dying brother, in his ear, And made the royal flowers around upfold Their gorgeous faces in the leafy band, Like the mimosa touched by mortal hand. Then almost ghastly seem'd the tinted sheen, Saltless and savourless those luscious meats, Till quick the Lady rose, with smile serene, As one who could command but still entreats, And filling a gold goblet, kissed the brim, And passed it bubbling from her lips to him. At once absorbing that nectareous draught, And the delicious radiance of those eyes, At doubt and terror-fit he inly laughed, And grasped her hand as 'twere a tourney's prize; And heard this murmur, as she nearer drew, “Yes, I am Love, and Love was made for you!” They were alone: the attendants, one by one, Had vanished: faint and fainter rose the air Oppressed with odours: through the twilight shone The glory of white limbs and lustrous hair, Confusing sight and spirit, till he fell, The will-less, mindless, creature of the spell. In the dull deep of satisfied desire Not long a prisoner lay that knightly soul, But on his blood, as on a wave of fire, Uneasy fancies rode without control, Voices and phantoms that did scarcely seem To take the substance of an order'd dream. At first he stood beside a public road, Hedged in by myrtle and embower'd by plane, While figures, vested in old Grecian mode, Drew through the pearly dawn a winding train, So strangely character'd, he could not know Were it of triumph or funereal woe. For crowns of bay enwreath'd each beauteous head, Beauty of perfect maid and perfect man; Slow-paced the milk-white oxen garlanded; Torch-bearing children mingled as they ran Gleaming amid the elder that uphold Tripods and cups and plates of chasèd gold. But then he marked the flowers were colourless, Crisp-wither'd hung the honourable leaves, And on the faces sat the high distress Of those whom Self sustains when Fate bereaves: So gazed he, wondering how that pomp would close, When the dream changed, but not to his repose. For now he was within his father's hall, No tittle changed of form or furniture, But all and each a grave memorial Of youthful days, too careless to endure,— There was his mother's housewife-work, and there, Beside the fire, his grandame's crimson chair: Where, cowering low, that ancient woman sat, Her bony fingers twitching on her knee, Her dry lips muttering fast he knew not what, Only the sharp convulsion could he see; But, as he looked, he felt a conscience dim That she was urging God in prayer for him. Away in trembling wretchedness he turn'd, And he was in his leman's arms once more; Yet all the jewell'd cressets were outburn'd, And all the pictured walls, so gay before, Show'd, in the glimmer of one choking lamp, Blotched with green mould and worn by filthy damp. Enormous bats their insolent long wings Whirl'd o'er his head, and swung against his brow, And shrieked—“We cozen'd with our ministerings The foolish knight, and have our revel now:” And worms bestrew'd the weeds that overspread The floor with silken flowers late carpeted. His sick astonished looks he straight addressed To her whose tresses lay around his arm, And fervent breath was playing on his breast, To seek the meaning of this frightful charm; But she was there no longer, and instead, He was the partner of a demon's bed,— That, slowly rising, brought the lurid glare Of its fixed eyes close opposite to his; One scaly hand laced in his forehead hair, Threatening his lips with pestilential kiss, And somewise in the fiendish face it wore, He traced the features he did erst adore. With one instinctive agony he drew His sword, that Palestine remember'd well And, quick recoiling, dealt a blow so true, That down the devilish head in thunder fell:— The effort seem'd against a jutting stone To strike his hand, and then he woke—alone! Alone he stood amid those ruins old, His treasury of sweet care and pleasant pain; The hemlock crushed defined the body's mould Of one who long and restless there had lain; His vest was beaded with the dew of dawn, His hand fresh-blooded, and his sword fresh drawn! The eastern star, a crystal eye of gold, Full on the statued form of Beauty shone, Now prostrate, powerless, featureless and cold, A simple trunk of deftly carven stone: Deep in the grasses that dismember'd head Lay like the relics of the ignoble dead. But Beauty's namesake and sidereal shrine Now glided slowly down that pallid sky, Near and more near the thin horizon line, In the first gush of morning, there to die,— While the poor Knight, with wilder'd steps and brain, Hasten'd the glimmering village to regain. With few uncertain words and little heed His followers' anxious questions he put by, Bidding each one prepare his arms and steed, For “they must march before the sun was high, And neither Apennine or Alp should stay Though for a single night, his homeward way.” On, on, with scanty food and rest he rode, Like one whom unseen enemies pursue, Urging his favourite horse with cruel goad, So that the lagging servants hardly knew Their master of frank heart and ready cheer, In that lone man who would not speak or hear. Till when at last he fairly saw behind The Alpine barrier of perennial snow, He seem'd to heave a burthen off his mind,— His blood in calmer current seem'd to flow, And like himself he smiled once more, but cast No light or colour on that cloudy past. From the old Teuton forest, echoing far, Came a stern welcome, hailing him restored To the true health of life in peace or war, Fresh morning toil, that earns the generous board; And waters, in the clear unbroken voice Of childhood, spoke—“Be thankful and rejoice!” Glad as the dove returning to his ark Over the waste of universal sea, He heard the huge house-dog's familiar bark, He traced the figure of each friendly tree, And felt that he could never part from this His home of daily love and even bliss. And in the quiet closure of that place, He soon his first affection linked anew, In that most honest passion finding grace, His soul with primal vigour to endue, And crush the memories that at times arose, To stain pure joy and trouble high repose. Never again that dear and dangerous land, So fresh with all her weight of time and story, Her winterless delights and slumbers bland, On thrones of shade, amid a world of glory, Did he behold: the flashing cup could please No longer him who knew the poison-lees. So lived he, pious, innocent, and brave, The best of friends I ever saw on earth: And now the uncommunicable grave Has closed on him, and left us but his worth; I have revealed this strange and secret tale, Of human fancy and the powers of bale. He told it me, one autumn evening mild, Sitting, greyhair'd, beneath an old oak tree, His dear true wife beside him, and a child, Youngest of many, dancing round his knee,— And bade me, if I would, in fragrant rhymes Embalm it, to be known in after-times. CHARLEMAGNE, AND THE HYMN OF CHRIST. “And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.”—Matt. xxvi. 30; Mark xiv. 26. The great King Karl sat in his secret room,— He had sat there all day; He had not called on minstrel knight or groom To wile one hour away. Of arms or royal toil he had no care, Nor e'en of royal mirth; As if a poor lone monk he rather were, Than lord of half the earth. But chance he had some pleasant company, Dear wife, familiar friend, With whom to let the quiet hours slip by, As if they had no end. The learnèd Alcuin, that large-browed clerk, Was there within, and none beside; A book they read, and, where the sense was dark, He was a trusty guide. What book had worth so long to occupy The thought of such a king, To make the weight of all that sovereignty Be a forgotten thing? Surely it were no other than the one, Whose every line is fraught With what a mightier King than He had done, Conquered, endured, and taught. There his great soul, drawn onward by the eye, Saw in plain chronicle portrayed The slow unfolding of the mystery On which its life was stayed. There read he how when Jesus, our dear Lord, To men of sin and dust had given, By the transforming magic of his word, The bread of very Heaven; So that our race, by Adam's fatal food Reduced to base decline, Partaking of that body and that blood, Might be again divine,— After this wondrous largess, and before The unimagined pain, Which, in Gethsemane, the Saviour bore Within his heart and brain,— He read, how these two acts of Love between, Ere that prolific day was dim, Christ and his Saints, like men with minds serene, Together sung a hymn. These things he read in childly faith sincere, Then paused and fixed his eye, And said with kingly utterance—“I must hear That Hymn before I die. “I will send forth through sea and sun and snows To lands of every tongue, To try if there be not some one which knows The music Jesus sung. “For I have found delight in songs profane Trolled by a foolish boy, And when the monks intone a pious strain, My heart is strong in joy; “How blessèd then to hear those harmonies, Which Christ's own voice divine engaged! 'Twould be as if a wind from Paradise A wounded soul assuaged.” Within the Emperor's mind that anxious thought Lay travailing all night long, He dreamed that Magi to his hand had brought The burthen of the Song; And when to his grave offices he rose, He kept his earnest will, To offer untold guerdons unto those Who should that dream fulfil. But first he called to counsel in the hall Wise priests of reverend name, And with an open countenance to them all Declared his hope and aim. He said, “It is God's pleasure, that my will Is made the natural law Of many nations, so that out of ill All good things I may draw. “Therefore this holy mission I decree, Sparing no pains or cost, That thus those sounds of dearest memory Be not for ever lost.” They spake. “Tradition streameth thro' our race, Most like the gentle whistling air, To which of old Elias veiled his face, Conscious that God was there: “Not in the storm, the earthquake, and the flame, That troubled Horeb's brow, The splendour and the power of God then came, Nor thus he cometh now. “The silent water filtereth through earth, One day to bless the summer land; The Word of God in Man slow bubbleth forth, Touched by a worthy hand. “Thus, in the memory of some careful Jew May lurk the record of a tune Wont to be sung in ceremonial due After the Paschal noon; “And thy deep yearning for this mystic song May give mankind at last Some charm and blessing that has slept full long The slumber of the Past.” The King rejoiced, and, at this high behest, Men, to all toil and change inured, Passed out to search the World if East or West That legend still endured. What good or ill those venturous hearts befell, What glory or what shame,— How far they wandered, I have not to tell; Each has his separate fame. I only know, that when the weight of hours The prime of mortal heads had bowed, He, slowly letting go his outward powers, Spoke from his couch aloud:— “My soul has waited many a lingering year To taste that one delight, And now I know at last that I shall hear The hymn of Christ to-night. “Look out, good friends! be prompt to welcome home, Straight to my presence bring, My messengers, who hither furnished come The Song of Christ to sing.” Dark sank that night, but darker rose the morn, That found the western earth Of the divinest presence stripped and shorn It ever woke to birth. It seemed beyond the common lawful sway Of Death and Nature o'er our kind, That such a one as He should pass away. And aught be left behind. In Aachen Abbey's consecrated ground, Within the hollowed stone, They placed the imperial body, robed and crowned, Seated as on a throne. While the blest spirit holds communion free With that eternal quire, Of which on earth to trace the memory Was his devout desire. It is probable that the hymn sung on this occasion was the Hallel, or part of it. The Hallel is invariably chanted in all Jewish families on the two first evenings of the Passover, and consists of Psalms 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, and 118, and is also read in the synagogue on every day of that feast. The music is not different from that of other Hebrew chants; but the Song of Moses, which is chanted on the seventh day of the Passover, has a peculiar traditional air, which is probably the earliest musical composition preserved to our times.</field>
