Here begynnys ane littil tretie intitulit the goldyn targe compilit be Maister Wilyam Dunbar. Ryght as the stern of day begouth to schyne, Quhen gone to bed war Vesper and Lucyne, I raise, and by a rosere did me rest; Wp sprang the goldyn candill matutyne, With clere depurit bemes cristallyne, Glading the mery foulis in thair nest; Or Phebus was in purpur cape revest Wp raise the lark, the hevyns menstrale fyne In May, in till a morow myrthfullest. Full angellike thir birdis sang thair houris Within thair courtyns grene, in to thair bouris, Apparalit quhite and red, wyth blomes suete; Anamalit was the felde wyth all colouris, The perly droppis schake in silvir schouris, Quhill all in balme did branch and levis flete; To part fra Phebus, did Aurora grete, Hir cristall teris I saw hyng on the flouris, Quhilk he for lufe all drank vp with his hete. For mirth of May, wyth skippis and wyth hoppis, The birdis sang vpon the tender croppis, With curiouse note, as Venus chapell clerkis: The rosis yong, new spreding of thair knoppis, War powderit brycht with hevinly beriall droppis, Throu bemes rede, birnyng as ruby sperkis; The skyes rang for schoutyng of the larkis, The purpur hevyn our scailit in silvir sloppis Ourgilt the treis, branchis, lef[is] and barkis. Doun throu the ryce a ryuir ran wyth stremys, So lustily agayn thai lykand lemys, That all the lake as lamp did leme of licht, Quhilk schadovit all about wyth twynkling glemis; That bewis bathit war in secund bemys Throu the reflex of Phebus visage brycht; On every syde the hegies raise on hicht, The bank was grene, the bruke vas full of bremys, The stanneris clere as stern in frosty nycht. The cristall air, the sapher firmament, The ruby skyes of the orient, Kest beriall bemes on emerant bewis grene; The rosy garth depaynt and redolent, With purpur, a?ure, gold, and goulis gent Arayed was, by dame Fflora the quene, So nobily, that ioy was for to sene; The roch agayn the rywir resplendent As low enlumynit all the leues schene. Quhat throu the mery foulys armony, And throu the ryueris sounn rycht ran me by, On Fflorais mantill I slepit as I lay, Quhare sone in to my dremes fantasy I saw approch agayn the orient sky, A saill, als quhite as blossum vpon spray, Wyth merse of gold, brycht as the stern of day; Quhilk tendit to the land full lustily, As falcounn swift desyrouse of hir pray. And hard on burd vnto the blomyt medis, Amang the grene rispis and the redis, Arrivit sche, quhar fro anonn thare landis Ane hundreth ladyes, lusty in to wedis, Als fresch as flouris that in May vp spredis, In kirtillis grene, withoutyn kell or bandis: Thair brycht hairis hang gletering on the strandis In tressis clere, wyppit wyth goldyn thredis, With pappis quhite, and mydlis small as wandis. Discriue I wald, bot quho coud wele endyte How all the feldis wyth thai lilies quhite Depaynt war brycht, quhilk to the hevyn did glete: Noucht thou, [H]omer, als fair as thou coud wryte, For all thine ornate stilis so perfyte; Nor yit thou, Tullius, quhois lippis suete Off rethorike did in to termes flete: Your aureate tongis both bene all to lyte, For to compile that paradise complete. Thare saw I Nature, and [als dame] Venus quene, The fresch Aurora, and lady Flora schene, Iuno, Appollo, and Proserpyna, Dyane the goddesse chaste of woddis grene, My lady Cleo, that help of Makaris bene, Thetes, Pallas, and prudent Minerua, Fair feynit Fortune, and lemand Lucina, Thir mychti quenis in crounis mycht be sene, Wyth bemys blith, bricht as Lucifera. There saw I May, of myrthfull monethis quene, Betuix Aprile, and June, her sister schene, Within the gardyng walking vp and doun, Quham of the foulis gladdith al bedene; Scho was full tender in hir yeris grene. Thare saw I Nature present hir a gounn Rich to behald, and nobil of renounn, Off ewiry hew under the hevin that bene Depaynt, and broud be gude proporcioun. Full lustily thir ladyes all in fere Enterit within this park of most plesere, Quhare that I lay our helit wyth leuis ronk; The mery foulis, blisfullest of chere, Salust Nature, me thoucht, on thair manere, And ewiry blome on branch, and eke on bonk, Opnyt and spred thair balmy leuis donk, Full low enclynyng to thair Quene so clere, Quham of thair nobill norising thay thonk. Syne to dame Flora, on the samyn wyse, Thay saluse, and thay thank a thousand syse; And to dame Wenus, lufis mychti quene, Thay sang ballettis in lufe, as was the gyse, With amourouse notis lusty to devise, As thay that had lufe in thair hertis grene; Thair hony throtis, opnyt fro the splene, With werblis suete did perse the hevinly skyes, Quhill loud resownyt the firmament serene. Ane othir court thare saw I consequent, Cupide the king, wyth bow in hand ybent, And dredefull arowis grundyn scharp and square: Thare saw I Mars, the god armypotent, Aufull and sterne, strong and corpolent; Thare saw I crabbit Saturn ald and haire, His luke was lyke for to perturb the aire; Thare was Mercurius, wise and eloquent, Of rethorike that fand the flouris faire; Thare was the god of gardingis, Priapus; Thare was the god of wildernes, Phanus; And Ianus, god of entree delytable; Thare was the god of fludis, Neptunus; Thare was the god of wyndis, Eolus, With variand luke, rycht lyke a lord vnstable; Thare was Bacus the gladder of the table; Thare was Pluto, the elrich incubus, In cloke of grene, his court usit no sable. And ewiry one of thir, in grene arayit, On harp or lute full merily thai playit, And sang ballettis with michty notis clere: Ladyes to dance full sobirly assayit, Endlang the lusty rywir so thai mayit: Thair obseruance rycht hevynly was to here; Than crap I throu the leuis, and drew nere, Quhare that I was richt sudaynly affrayit, All throu a luke, quhilk I haue boucht full dere. And schortly for to speke, be lufis quene I was aspyit, scho bad hir archearis kene Go me arrest; and thay no time delayit; Than ladyes fair lete fall thair mantillis gren[e,] With bowis big in tressit hairis schene, All sudaynly thay had a felde arayit; And yit rycht gretly was I noucht affrayit, The party was so plesand for to sene, A wonder lusty bikkir me assayit. And first of all, with bow in hand ybent, Come dame Beautee, rycht as scho wald me schent; Syne folowit all hir dameselis yfere, With mony diuerse aufull instrument, Wnto the pres, Fair Having wyth hir went, Fyne Portrature, Plesance, and lusty Chere. Than come Resoun, with schelde of gold so clere, In plate and maille, as Mars armypotent, Defendit me that nobil cheuallere. Syne tender Youth come wyth hir virgyns ying, Grene Innocence, and schamefull Abaising, And quaking Drede, wyth humble Obedience; The Goldyn Targe harmyt thay no thing; Curage in thame was noucht begonne to spring; Full sore thay dred to done a violence: Suete Womanhede I saw cum in presence, Of artilye a warld sche did in bring, Seruit wyth ladyes full of reuerence. Scho led wyth hir Nurture and Lawlynes, Contenence, Pacience, Gude Fame and Stedfastnes, Discretioun, Gentrise, and Considerance, Leuefell Company, and Honest Besynes, Benigne Luke, Mylde Chere, and Sobirnes: All thir bure ganyeis to do me greuance; But Resonn bure the Targe wyth sik constance, Thair scharp assayes mycht do no dures To me, for all their aufull ordynance. Wnto the pres persewit Hie Degree, Hir folowit ay Estate and Dignitee, Comparisoun, Honour, and Noble Array, Will, Wantonnes, Renoun, and Libertee, Richesse, Fredomm, and eke Nobilitee: Wit ye thay did thair baner hye display; A cloud of arowis as hayle schour lousit thay, And schot, quhill wastit was thair artilye, Syne went abak reboytit of thair pray. Quhen Venus had persauit this rebute, Dissymilance scho bad go mak persute, At all powere to perse the Goldyn Targe; And scho that was of doubilnes the rute, Askit hir choise of archeris in refute. Wenus the best bad hir go wale at large; Scho tuke Presence plicht ankers of the barge, And Fair Callyng that wele a flayn coud schute, And Cherising for to complete hir charge. Dame Hamelynes scho tuke in company, That hardy was, and hende in archery, And broucht dame Beautee to the felde agayn; With all the choise of Venus cheualry Thay come, and bikkerit vnabaisitly: The schour of arowis rappit on as rayn; Perilouse Presence, that mony syre has slayne, The bataill broucht on bordour hard vs by, The salt was all the sarar suth to sayn. Thik was the schote of grundyn dartis kene; Bot Resoun with the Scheld of Gold so schene, Warly defendit quho so ewir assayit; The aufull stoure he manly did sustene, Quhill Presence kest a pulder in his ene, And than as drunkyn man he all forvayit: Quhen he was blynd the fule wyth hym thay playit, And banyst hym amang the bewis grene; That sory sicht me sudaynly affrayit. Than was I woundit to the deth wele nere, And yoldyn as a wofull prisonnere To lady Beautee, in a moment space; Me thoucht scho semyt lustiar of chere, Efter that Resoun tynt had his eyne clere, Than of before, and lufliare of face: Quhy was thou blyndit, Resoun? quhi, allace! And gert ane hell my paradise appere, And mercy seme, quhare that I fand no grace. Dissymulance was besy me to sile, And Fair Calling did oft apon me smyle, And Cherising me fed wyth wordis fair; New Acquyntance enbracit me a quhile, And fauouryt me, quhill men mycht go a myle, Syne tuk hir leve, I saw hir nevir mare: Than saw I Dangere toward me repair, I coud eschew hir presence be no wyle, On syde scho lukit wyth ane fremyt fare. And at the last departing coud hir dresse, And me delyuerit vnto Hevynesse For to remayne, and scho in cure me tuke; Be this the Lord of Wyndis, wyth wodenes, God Eolus, his bugill blew I gesse; That with the blast the leuis all to-schuke, And sudaynly, in the space of a luke, All was hyne went, thare was bot wildernes, Thare was no more bot birdis, bank, and bruke. In twynkling of ane eye to schip thai went, And swyth vp saile vnto the top thai stent, And with swift course atour the flude thay frak; Thay fyrit gunnis wyth powder violent, Till that the reke raise to the firmament, The rochis all resownyt wyth the rak, For reird it semyt that the raynbow brak; Wyth spirit affrayde apon my fete I sprent Amang the clewis, so carefull was the crak. And as I did awake of my sueving, The ioyfull birdis merily did syng For myrth of Phebus tendir bemes schene; Suete war the vapouris, soft the morowing, Halesum the vale, depaynt wyth flouris ying; The air attemperit, sobir, and amene; In quhite and rede was all the felde besene, Throu Naturis nobil fresch anamalyng, In mirthfull May, of ewiry moneth Quene. O reuerend Chaucere, rose of rethoris all, As in oure tong ane flour imperiall, That raise in Britane ewir, quho redis rycht, Thou beris of makaris the tryumph riall; Thy fresch anamalit termes celicall This mater coud illumynit haue full brycht: Was thou noucht of oure Inglisch all the lycht, Surmounting ewiry tong terrestriall, Alls fer as Mayes morow dois mydnycht? O morall Gower, and Ludgate laureate, Your sugurit lippis and tongis aureate, Bene to oure eris cause of grete delyte; Your angel mouthis most mellifluate Our rude langage has clere illumynate, And faire our-gilt oure speche, that imperfyte Stude, or your goldyn pennis schupe to wryte; This Ile before was bare, and desolate Off rethorike, or lusty fresch endyte. Thou lytill Quair, be ewir obedient, Humble, subiect, and symple of entent, Before the face of ewiry connyng wicht: I knaw quhat thou of rethorike hes spent; Off all hir lusty rosis redolent Is nonn in to thy gerland sett on hicht; Eschame thar of, and draw the out of sicht. Rude is thy wede, disteynit, bare, and rent, Wele aucht thou be afiret of the licht. II. THE FLYTING OF DUNBAR AND KENNEDIE. The flyting of D?bar and Kennedie heir efter followis Jocound and Mirrie. [DUNBAR TO KENNEDIE.] Schir Johne the Ross, ane thing thair is compild In generale be Kennedy and Quinting, Quhilk hes thame self aboif the sternis styld; Bot had thay maid of mannace ony mynting In speciall, sic stryfe sould ryse but stynting; Howbeit with bost thair breistis wer als bendit As Lucifer, that fra the hevin descendit, Hell sould nocht hyd thair harnis fra harmis hynting. The erd sould trymbill, the firmament sould schaik, And all the air in vennamus suddane stink, And all the diuillis of hell for redour quaik, To heir quhat I sould wryt, with pen and ynk; For and I flyt sum sege for schame sould sink, The se sould birn, the mone sould thoill ecclippis, Rochis sould ryfe, the warld sould hald no grippis, Sa loud of cair the commoun bell sould clynk. Bot wondir laith wer I to be ane baird, Flyting to vse, for gritly I eschame; For it is nowthir wynning nor rewaird, Bot tinsale baith of honour and of fame, Incres of sorrow, sklander, and evill name; ?it mycht thay be sa bald, in thair bakbytting, To gar me ryme, and rais the feynd with flytting, And throw all cuntreis, and kinrikis thame proclame. Quod Dumbar to Kennedy. [KENNEDIE TO DUNBAR.] Dirtin Dumbar, quhome on blawes thow thy boist? Pretendand the to wryte sic skaldit skrowis; Ramowd rebald, thow fall doun att the roist, My laureat lettres at the and I lowis; Mandrag, mymmerkin, maid maister bot in mowis, Thryse scheild trumpir, with ane threid bair goun, Say Deo mercy, or I cry the doun, And leif thy ryming, rebald, and thy rowis. Dreid, dirtfast dearch, that thow hes dissobeyit My cousing Quintene and my commissar; Fantastik fule, trest weill thow salbe fleyit, Ignorant elf, aip, owll irregular, Skaldit skaitbird, and commoun skamelar; Wan-fukkit funling, that natour maid ane yrle, Baith Iohne the Ross and thow, sall squeill and skirle And evir I heir ocht of ?our making mair. Heir I put sylence to the in all partis, Obey and ceis the play that thow pretendis; Waik walidrag, and werlot of the cairtis, Se sone thow mak my commissar amendis, And lat him lay sax leichis on thy lendis, Meikly in recompansing of thi scorne, Or thow sall ban the tyme that thow wes borne, For Kennedy to the this cedull sendis. Quod Kennedy to Dumbar. Iuge in the nixt quha gat the war. [DUNBAR TO KENNEDIE.] Irsche brybour baird, wyle beggar with thy brattis, Cuntbittin crawdoun Kennedy, coward of kynd, Evill farit and dryit, as Denseman on the rattis, Lyke as the gleddis had on thy gulesnowt dynd; Mismaid monstour, ilk mone owt of thy mynd, Renunce, rebald, thy ryming, thow bot royis, Thy trechour tung hes tane ane heland strynd; Ane lawland ers wald mak a bettir noyis. Revin, raggit ruke, and full of rebaldrie, Scarth fra scorpione, scaldit in scurrilitie, I se the haltane in thy harlotrie, And in to vthir science no thing slie, Off every vertew woyd, as men may sie; Quytclame clergie, and cleik to the ane club, Ane baird blasphemar, in brybrie ay to be; For wit and wisdome ane wisp fra the may rub. Thow speiris, dastard, gif I dar with the fecht? ?e dagone, dowbart, thairof haif thow no dowt! Quhair evir we meit thairto my hand I hecht, To red thy rebald ryming with a rowt: Throw all Bretane it salbe blawin owt, How that thow, poysonit pelor, gat thy paikis; With ane doig leich I schepe to gar the schowt, And nowthir to the tak knyfe, swerd, nor aix. Thow crop and rute of traitouris tressonable, The fathir and moder of morthour and mischeif, Dissaitfull tyrand, with serpentis tung, vnstable; Cukcald cradoun, cowart, and commoun theif; Thow purpest for to vndo our Lordis cheif In Paislay, with ane poysone that wes fell, For quhilk, brybour, ?it sall thow thoill a breif; Pelour, on the I sall it preif my sell. Thocht I wald lie, thy frawart phisnomy Dois manifest thy malice to all men; Fy! tratour theif; Ffy! glengoir loun, fy! fy! Fy! feyndly front, far fowlar than ane fen. My freyindis thow reprovit with thy pen? Thow leis, tratour! quhilk I sall on the preif, Suppois thy heid war armit tymis ten, Thow sall recryat, or thy croun sall cleif. Or thow durst move thy mynd malitius, Thow saw the saill abone my heid up draw; But Eolus full woid, and Neptunus, Mirk and moneless, wes met with wind and waw, And mony hundreth myle hyne cowd ws blaw By Holland, Seland, ?etland, and Northway coist, In desert quhair we wer famist aw; ?it come I hame, fals baird, to lay thy boist. Thow callis the rethory with thy goldin lippis: Na, glowrand, gaipand fule, thow art begyld, Thow art bot Gluncoch with thy giltin hippis, That for thy lounry mony a leisch hes fyld; Wan wisaged widdefow, out of thy wit gane wyld, Laithly and lowsy, als lathand as ane leik, Sen thow with wirschep wald sa fane be styld, Haill, souerane sen?eour! Thy bawis hingis throw thy breik. Forworthin fule, of all the warld reffuse, Quhat ferly is thocht thow reioys to flyte? Sic eloquence as thay in Erschry vse, In sic is sett thy thraward appetyte; Thow hes full littill feill of fair indyte: I tak on me ane pair of Lowthiane hippis. Sall fairar Inglis mak, and mair parfyte, Than thow can blabbar with thy Carrik lippis. Bettir thow ganis to leid ane doig to skomer, Pynit pykpuirs pelour, than with thy maister pingill. Thow lay full prydles in the peise this somer, And fane at evin for to bring hame a single, Syne rubbit at ane vthir auld wyfis ingle; Bot now, in winter, for purteth thow art traikit; Thow hes na breik to latt thy bollokis gyngill; Beg the ane club, for, baird thow sall go naikit. Lene larbar, loungeour, baith lowsy in lisk and lon?e; Ffy! skolderit skyn, thow art bot skyre and skrumple; For he that rostit Lawarance had thy grun?e, And he that hid sanct Johnis ene with ane wimple, And he that dang sanct Augustine with ane rumple, Thy fowll front had, and he that Bartilmo flaid; The gallowis gaipis eftir thy graceles gruntill, As thow wald for ane haggeis, hungry gled. Commirwald crawdoun, na man comptis the ane kerse, Sueir swappit swanky, swynekeper ay for swaittis; Thy commissar Quintyne biddis the cum kiss his erse, He luvis nocht sic ane forlane loun of laittis; He sayis, thow skaffis and beggis mair beir and aitis Nor ony cripill in Karrik land abowt; Uthir pure beggaris and thow ar at debaittis, Decrepit karlingis on Kennedy cryis owt. Mater annwch I haiff, I bid nocht fen?ie, Thocht thow, fowll trumpour, thus vpoun me leid; Corrupt carioun, he sall I cry thy sen?ie; Thinkis thow nocht how thow come in grit neid, Greitand in Galloway, lyk to ane gallow breid, Ramand, and rolpand, beggand koy and ox; I saw the thair, in to thy wachemanis weid, Quhilk wes nocht worth ane pair of auld gray fox. Ersch Katherane, with thy polk breik, and rilling, Thow and thy quene, as gredy gleddis, ?e gang With polkis to mylne, and beggis baith meill and schilling; Thair is bot lyse, and lang nailis ?ow amang: Ffowll heggirbald, for hennis thus will ?e hang, Thow hes ane perrellus face to play with lambis; Ane thowsand kiddis, wer thay in faldis full strang, Thy lymmerfull luke wald fle thame and thair dammis. In till ane glen thow hes, owt of repair, Ane laithly luge that wes the lippir mennis; With the ane sowtaris wyfe, off bliss als bair, And lyk twa stalkaris steilis in cokis and hennis, Thow plukkis the pultre, and scho pullis off the pennis; All Karrik cryis, God gif this dowsy be drownd; And quhen thow heiris ane guse cry in the glennis, Thow thinkis it swetar than sacrand bell of sound. Thow La?arus, thow laithly lene tramort, To all the warld thow may example be; To luk vpoun thy gryslie peteous port, Ffor hiddowis, haw, and holkit is thyne ee; Thy cheik bane bair, and blaiknit is thy ble; Thy choip, thy choll, garris men for to leif chest; Thy gane it garris us think that we mon de: I coniure the, thow hungert heland gaist. The larbar lukis of thy lang lene craig, Thy pure pynit thrott, pelit and owt of ply, Thy skolderit skin, hewd lyk ane saffrone bag, Garris men dispyt thar flesche, thow spreit of Gy: Ffy! feyndly ffront; ffy! tykis face, ffy! ffy! Ay loungand, lyk ane loikman on ane ledder; [Thy ghaistly luke fleys folkis that pas the by,] Lyke to ane stark theif glowrand in ane tedder. Nyse nagus, nipcaik, with thy schulderis narrow, Thow lukis lowsy, loun of lownis aw; Hard hurcheoun, hirpland, hippit as ane harrow, Thy rigbane rattillis, and thy ribbis on raw, Thy hanchis hirklis, with hukebanis harth and haw, Thy laithly lymis ar lene as ony treis; Obey, theif baird, or I sall brek thy gaw, Ffowll carrybald, cry mercy on thy kneis. Thow purehippit, vgly averill, With hurkland banis, holkand throw thy hyd, Reistit and crynit as hangitman on hill, And oft beswakkit with ane ourhie tyd, Quhilk brewis mekle barret to thy bryd; Hir cair is all to clenge thy cabroch howis, Quhair thow lyis sawsy in saphron, bak and syd, Powderit with prymross, sawrand all with clowiss. Fforworthin wirling, I warne the it is wittin, How, skyttand skarth, thow hes the hurle behind; Wan wraiglane wasp, ma wormiss hes thow beschittin, Nor thair is gerss on grund, or leif on lind; Thocht thow did first sic foly to my fynd, Thow sall agane with ma witness than I; Thy gulsoch gane dois on thy back it bind, Thy hostand hippis lattis nevir thy hoss go dry. Thow held the burcht lang with ane borrowit goun, And ane caprowsy barkit all with sweit, And quhen the laidis saw the sa lyk a loun, Thay bickerit the with mony bae and bleit: Now vpaland thow leivis on rubbit quheit, Oft for ane causs thy burdclaith neidis no spredding, Ffor thow hes nowthir for to drink nor eit, Bot lyk ane berdles baird, that had no bedding. Strait Gibbonis air, that nevir ourstred ane horse, Bla berfute berne, in bair tyme wes thow borne; Thow bringis the Carrik clay to Edinburgh Corse, Upoun thy botingis, hobland hard as horne; Stra wispis hingis owt, quhair that the wattis ar worne: Cum thow agane to skar us with thy strais, We sall gar scale our sculis all the to scorne, And stane the vp the calsay quhair thow gais. Off Edinburgh, the boyis as beis owt thrawis, And cryis owt ay, “Heir cumis our awin queir Clerk!” Than fleis thow, lyk ane howlat chest with crawis, Quhill all the bichis at thy botingis dois bark: Than carlingis cryis, “Keip curches in the merk, Our gallowis gaipis; lo! quhair ane greceles gais.” Ane vthir sayis, “I se him want ane sark, I reid ?ow, cummer, tak in your lynning clais.” Than rynis thow doun the gait, with gild of boyis, And all the toun tykis hingand in thy heilis; Of laidis and lownis thair ryssis sic ane noyis, Quhill runsyis rynnis away with cairt and quheilis, And cager aviris castis bayth coillis and creilis, Ffor rerd of the, and rattling of thy butis; Fische wyvis cryis, Fy! and castis doun skillis and skeilis; Sum claschis the, sum cloddis the on the cutis. Loun lyk Mahoun, be boun me till obey, Theif, or in greif, mischeif sall the betyd; Cry grace, tykis face, or I the chece and sley; Oule, rere and ?owle, I sall defowll thy pryd; Peilet gled, baith fed and bred of bichis syd, And lyk ane tyk, purspyk, quhat man settis by the! Forflittin, countbittin, beschittin, barkit hyd, Clym ledder, fyle tedder, foule edder, I defy the. Mauch muttoun, vyle buttoun, peilit gluttoun, air to Hilhouse; Rank beggar, ostir dregar, foule fleggar, in the flet; Chittirlilling, ruch rilling, lik schilling in the milhouse; Baird rehator, theif of natour, fals tratour, feyndis gett; Filling of tauch, rak sauch, cry crauch, thow art our sett; Muttoun dryver, girnall ryver, ?adswyvar, fowll fell the: Herretyk, lunatyk, purspyk, carlingis pet, Rottin crok, dirtin dok, cry cok, or I sall quell the. Quod Dunbar to Kennedy. [KENNEDIE TO DUNBAR.] Dathane deuillis sone, and dragon dispitous, Abironis birth, and bred with Beliall; Wod werwolf, worme, and scorpion vennemous, Lucifers laid, fowll feyindis face infernall; Sodomyt, syphareit fra sanctis celestiall, Put I nocht sylence to the, schiphird knaif, And thow of new begynis to ryme and raif, Thow salbe maid blait, bleir eit, bestiall. How thy forbearis come, I haif a feill, At Cokburnispeth, the writ makis me war, Generit betuix ane sche beir and a deill; Sa wes he callit Dewlbeir and nocht Dumbar: This Dewlbeir, generit of a meir of Mar, Wes Corspatrik, Erle of Merche; and be illusioun The first that evir put Scotland to confusioun Wes that fals tratour, hardely say I dar. Quhen Bruce and Balioll differit for the croun, Scottis Lordis could nocht obey Inglis lawis; This Corspatrick betrasit Berwick toun, And slew sevin thousand Scottismen within thay wawis, The battall syne of Spottismuir he gart cause, And come with Edwart Langschankis to the feild, Quhair twelve thowsand trew Scottismen wer keild, And Wallace chest, as the Cornicle schawis. Scottis Lordis chiftanes he gart hald and chessone In firmance fast, quhill all the feild wes done, Within Dumbar, that auld spelunk of tressoun; Sa Inglis tykis in Scottland wes abone, Than spul?eit thay the haly stane of Scone, The Croce of Halyrudhouse, and vthir jowellis. He birnis in hell, body, banis, and bowellis, This Corspatrik that Scotland hes vndone. Wallace gart cry ane counsale in to Perth, And callit Corspatrick tratour be his style; That dampnit dragone drew him in diserth, And sayd, he kend bot Wallace, king in Kyle: Out of Dumbar that theif he maid exyle Unto Edward, and Inglis grund agane: Tigris, serpentis, and taidis will remane In Dumbar wallis, todis, wolffis and beistis wyle. Na fowlis of effect amangis tha binkis Biggis, nor abydis, for no thing that may be; Thay stanis of tressone as the bruntstane stinkis. Dewlbeiris moder, cassin in by the se, The wariet apill of the forbiddin tre, That Adame eit, quhen he tynt Paradyce, Scho eit invennomit lyk a cokkatryce, Syne merreit with the Diuill for dignite. ?it of new tressone, I can tell the tailis, That cumis on nycht in visioun in my sleip; Archbald Dumbar betrasd the house of Hailis, Becaus the ?ung Lord had Dumbar to keip; Pretendand throw that to thair rowmis to creip, Rycht crewaly his castell he persewit, Brocht him furth boundin and the place reskewit, Sett him in fetteris in ane dungeoun deip. It war aganis bayth natur and gud ressoun, That Dewlbeiris bairnis were trew to God or man; Quhilkis wer baith gottin, borne, and bred with tressoun, Bel?ebubbis oyis, and curst Corspatrikis clan: Thow wes prestyt, and ordanit be Sathan For to be borne to do thy kin defame, And gar me schaw thy antecessouris schame; Thy kin that leivis may wary the and ban. Sen thow on me thus, lymmer, leis and trattillis, And fyndis sentence foundit of invy, Thy elderis banis ilk nycht ryssis and rattillis, Apon thy corss vengeance, vengeance! thay cry. Thow art the cause thay may not rest, nor ly; Thow says for thame few psaltris, psalmis, or creidis, Bot geris me tell thair trentalis of misdeidis, And thair ald sin with new schame certify. Insensuat sow, cesse fals Eustase air! And knaw, kene skald, I hald of Alathya, And cause me nocht the cause lang to declair Of thy curst kyn, Deulber and his Allya: Cum to the Croce, on kneis, and mak a crya; Confess thy crime, hald Kenydy the king, And with ane hauthorne skurge thy self and dyng; Thus dre thy penance wyth Deliquisti quia. Pass to my commissar, and be confest, Cour befoir him on kneis, and cum in will; And syne ger Stobo for thy lyf protest; Renounce thy rymis, baith ban and birn thy bill; Heve to the heuyn thy handis, ande hald the still: Do thou nocht thus, brigane, thou salbe brynt, Wyth pik, fyre, ter, gun puldre, or lint, On Arthuris Sete, or on ane hyar hill. I perambalit of Pernaso the montayn, Enspirit wyth Mercury fra his goldyn spere; And dulcely drank of eloquence the fontayne, Quhen it was purifit with frost, and flowit cleir: And thou come, Fule! in Marche or Februere, Thair till a pule, and drank the paddok rod, That gerris the ryme in to thy termis glod, And blaberis that noyis mennis eris to here. Thow lufis nane Irische, elf, I vnderstand, Bot it suld be all trew Scottis mennis lede; It was the gud langage of this land, And Scota it causit to multiply and sprede, Quhill Corspatrik, that we of tressoun reid, Thy forefader, maid Irisch and Irisch men thin, Throw his tressoun broght Inglise rumplis in, Sa wald thy self, mycht thou to him succede. Ignorant fule! in to thy mowis and mokis, It may be verifeit that thy wit is thin; Quhare thow writis Densmen dryit apon the rattis, Densmen of Denmark ar of the kingis kyn. The wit thou suld haue had, was castin in Evyn at thyne ers, bakwart, with a staf flong. Herefore, fals harlot, hursone, hald thy tong: Deulbere! thow devis the deuill, thyne eme, wyth dyn. Quhare as thow said, that I stall hennis and lammys, I latt the wit, I haue land, store and stakkis. Thou wald be fayn to gnaw, lad, wyth thy gammys, Wnder my burd, smoch banis behynd doggis bakkis: Thow has a tome purs, I haue stedis and takkis, Thow tynt cultur, I haif cultur and pleuch, Substance and geir, thou has a wedy teuch On Mount Falconn, about thy crag to rax. And yit Mount Falconn gallowis is our fair, For to be fylde with sic a frutles face; Cum hame, and hing on our gallowis of Aire, To erd the vnder it I sall purchas grace; To eit thy flesch the doggis sall haue na space, The ravyns sall ryve na thing bot thy tong rutis, For thou sik malice of thy maister mutis, It is wele sett that thou sik barat brace. Small fynance amang thy frendis thow beggit, To stanch the storm, wyth haly muldis thou loste; Thou sailit to get a dowcare, for to dreg it, It lyis closit in a clout on Seland cost: Sic reule gerris the be seruit wyth cald rost, And sitt vnsoupit oft be?ond the sey, Cryiand caritas at durris amore Dei, Bairfut, brekeles, and all in duddis vpdost. Deulbere hes not ado with a Dunbar, The Erl of Murray bure that surname ryght, That euyr trew to the King and constant ware, And of that kin come Dunbar of Westfelde knyght; That successione is hardy, wyse, and wycht, And has na thing ado now with the deuile: Bot Deulbere is thy kyn, and kennis the wele, And has in hell for the a chaumir dicht. Cursit croapand craw, I sall ger crop thy tong, And thou sall cry, Cor mundum, on thy kneis; Duerch, I sall ding the, quhill thow dryte and dong, And thou sall lik thy lippis, and suere thou leis: I sall degraid the, graceles, of thy greis; Scaile the for scorne, and shere the of the scule, Ger round the hede transforme the till a fule, And syne with tresone trone the on the treis. Raw-mowit ribald, renegate rehatour, My linage and forebearis war ay lele; It cumis of kynde to the to be a traytoure, To ryde on nycht, to rug, to reue, and stele. Quhen thow puttis poysonn to me, I appelle The in that part, [and] preue it pelour wyth thy persone; Clame not to clergy, [for] I defy the, gersone, Thow sall by it dere, wyth me, duerche, and thou dele. In Ingland, oule, suld be thyne habitacione, Homage to Edward Langschankis maid thy kyn, In Dunbar thai ressauit him the false nacione, Thay suld be exilde Scotland mare and myn. A stark gallowis, ane wedy, and a pyn, The hede poynt of thyne elderis armes ar; Wryttyn abone in poesie, Hang Dunbar, Quarter and draw, and mak that surname thin. I am the kingis blude, his trew speciall clerk, That newir yit ymaginit hym offense, Constant in myn allegeance, word et werk, Onely dependand on his excellence; Traistand to haue of his magnificence Guerdoun, reward, and benefice bedene; Quhen that the ravyns sall ryve out bath thine ene, And on the rattis salbe thy residence. Fra Etrike Forest furthward to Drumfrese Thow beggit with a pardoun in all kirkis, Collapis, cruddis, mele, grotis, grisis, and geis, And ondir nycht quhyle stall thou staggis et stirkis. Because that Scotland of thy begging irkis, Thow scapis in France to be a knycht of the felde; Thow has thy clamschellis, and thy burdoun kelde, Wnhonest wayis all, wolronn, that thou wirkis. Thou may not pas Mount Barnard for wild bestis, Nor wyn throw Mount Scarpre for the snawe; Mount Nycholas, Mount Godart thare arestis, Brigantis sik bois and blyndis thame wyth a blawe. In Parise wyth the maister buriawe Abyde, and be his prentice nere the bank, And help to hang the pece for half a frank, And, at the last, thy self sall thole the lawe. Haltane harlot, the deuill a gude thou hais! For fault of puissance, pelour, thou mon pak the; Thou drank thy thrift, sald and wedsett thy clais, Thare is na lorde that will in seruice tak the. A pak of fla-skynnis, fynance for to mak the, Thow sall ressaue, in Danskyn, of my tailye; With De profundis fend the, and that failye, And I sall send the blak Deuill for to bak the. Into the Katryne thou maid a foull cahute, For thow bedrait hir, doun fra starn to stere; Apon hir sydis was sene thou coud schute, Thy dirt clevis till hir towis this twenty yere: The firmament na firth was newir cler, Quhill thou, Deulbere, deuillis birth, was on the see, The saulis had sonkin throu the syn of the, War nocht the peple maid sa grete prayere. Quhen that the schip was saynit, et vndir saile, Foul brow in holl thow preposit for to pas, Thow schot, and was not sekir of thy tayle, Beschate the stere, the compas, et the glas; The skippar bad ger land the at the Bas: Thow spewit, and kest out mony a lathly lomp, Fastar than all the marynaris coud pomp; And now thy wame is wers than ewir it was. Had thai bene prouuait sa of schote of gvne By men of were but perile thay had past; As thow was louse, and reddy of thy bune, Thay micht haue tane the collum at the last; For thou wald cuk a cartfull at a cast; Thair is na schip that wil the now ressaue; Thow fylde faster than fyftenesum mycht lawe, And myrit thaym wyth thy mvk to the myd mast. Throu Ingland thef, and tak the to thy fute, And boun with the to haue a fals botwand; A horse marschall thou call the at the mute, And with that craft convoy the throu the land: Be na thing argh, tak ferily on hand, Happyn thow to be hangit in Northumbir, Than all thy kyn ar wele quyte of thy cumbir, And that mon be thy dome, I vndirstand. Hye Souuerane Lorde, lat newir this synfull sot Do schame, fra hame, vnto your nacion! That newir nane, sic ane, be callit a Scot, A rottyn crok, louse of the dok, thare doun. Fra honest folk deuoide this lathly lown: In sum desert, quhair thare is na repaire, For fyling and infecking of the aire, Cary this cankerit corrupt carioun. Thou was consauit in the grete eclips, A monstir maid be god Mercurius; Na hald agayn, na hoo is at thy hips, Infortunate, [foull,] false, et furius, Evill schryvin, wan-thryvin, not clene na curius; A myten, full of flyting, [the] flyrdom lyke, A crabbit, scabbit, euill facit messan tyke; A schit, but wit, schrewit et iniurius. Greit in the glaykis gude Maister Gilliam gukkis, Our imperfyte in poetry, or in prose, All closse vndir cloud of nycht thou cukkis. Rymis thou of me, of Rethory the Rose, Lunatike, lymare, luschbald, louse thy hose, That I may touch thy tone wyth tribulation, In recompensing of thy conspiration, Or turse the out of Scotland: tak thy chose. Ane benefice quha wald gyue sic ane beste, Bot gif it war to gyngill Iudas bellis; Tak the a fidill, or a floyt et geste, Wndought, thou art ordanyt to not ellis! Thy cloutit cloke, thy skryp, and thy clamschellis, Cleke on thy cors, and fare on in to France, And cum thow newir agayn but a mischance; The fend fare wyth the, forthward our the fellis. Cankrit Caym, tryit trowane, Tutiuillus, Marmaidyn, mymmerken, monstir of all men, I sall ger bake the to the lard of Hillhouse, To suelly the in stede of a pullit hen. Fowmart, fasert, fostirit in filth and fen, Foule fond, flend fule, apon thy phisnom fy! Thy dok of dirt dreipis, and will newir dry, To tume thy tone it has tyrit carlingis ten.

Nero thy nevow, Golyas thy grantsire, Pharao thy fader, Egipya thy dame, Deulbere, thir ar the causis that I conspire, Termygantis temp[t]ise the, et Waspasius thine eme; Bel?ebub thy full brothir will clame To be thyne air, and Cayphas thy sectour; Pluto thy hede of kyn, and protectour To hell to leid the, on lycht day and leme.

Apon the Midsumer ewin, mirriest of nichtis, I muvit furth allane, neir as midnicht wes past, Besyd ane gudlie grene garth, full of gay flouris, Hegeit, of ane huge hicht, with hawthorne treis; Quhairon ane bird, on ane bransche, so birst out hir notis That neuer ane blythfullar bird was on the beuche harde: Quhat throw the sugarat sound of hir sang glaid, And throw the sauar sanatiue of the sueit flouris, I drew in derne to the dyk to dirkin eftir myrthis; The dew donkit the daill, and dynarit the foulis. I hard, vnder ane holyn hewinlie grein hewit, Ane hie speiche, at my hand, with hautand wourdis; With that in haist to the hege so hard I inthrang That I was heildit with hawthorne, and with heynd leveis: Throw pykis of the plet thorne I presandlie luikit, Gif ony persoun wald approche within that plesand garding. I saw thre gay ladeis sit in ane grene arbeir, All grathit in to garlandis of fresche gudelie flouris; So glitterit as the gold wer thair glorius gilt tressis, Quhill all the gressis did gleme of the glaid hewis; Kemmit was thair cleir hair, and curiouslie sched Attour thair schulderis doun schyre, schyning full bricht; With curches, cassin thame abone, of kirsp cleir and thin: Thair mantillis grein war as the gress that grew in May sessoun, Fetrit with thair quhyt fingaris about thair fair sydis: Off ferliful fyne favour war thair faceis meik, All full of flurist fairheid, as flouris in June; Quhyt, seimlie, and soft, as the sweit lillies; New vpspred vpon spray, as new spynist rose, Arrayit ryallie about with mony rich wardour, That nature, full nobillie, annamalit fine with flouris Off alkin hewis under hewin, that ony heynd knew; Fragrant, all full of fresche odour fynest of smell, Ane marbre tabile coverit wes befoir thai thre ladeis, With ryale cowpis apon rawys full of ryche wynys: And of thir fair wlonkes, with tua [that] weddit war with lordis, Ane wes ane wedow, I wist, wantoun of laitis. And, as thai talkit at the tabill of mony taill funde, Thay wauchtit at the wicht wyne, and waris out wourdis; And syne thai spak more spedelie, and sparit no materis. [Deinde vidua jam cum interrogatione sua] Bewrie, said the Wedo, ?e weddit wemen ?ing, Quhat mirth ?e fand in maryage, sen ?e war menis wyffis; Reueill gif ?e rewit that rakles conditioun? Or gif that ever ?e luffit leyd vpone lyf mair Nor thame that ?e ?our fayth hes festinit for euir? Or gif ?e think, had ?e chois, that ?e wald cheis better? Think ?e it nocht ane blist band that bindis so fast, That none vnto it adew may say bot the deithe alane? [Responsio prime vxoris ad viduam] Than spak ane lusty belyf, with lusty effeiris; It, that ?e call the blist band that bindis so fast, Is bair of blis, and bailfull, and greit barrat wirkis. ?e speir, had I fre chois, gif I wald cheis better? Chen?eis ay ar to eschew; and changeis ar sueit: Sic cursit chance till eschew, had I my chois anis, Out of the chen?eis of ane churle I chaip suld for euir. God gif matrimony were made to mell for ane ?eir! It war bot monstrous to be mair, bot gif our myndis pleisit: It is agane the law of luif, of kynd, and of nature, Togiddir hairtis to streine, that stryveis with vther: Birdis hes ane better law na bernis be meikill, That ilk ?eir, with new ioy, ioyis ane maik; And fangis thame ane fresche feyr, vnful?eit, and constant; And lattis thair ful?eit feiris flie quhair thai pleis. Chryst gif sic ane consuetude war in this erth holdin! Than weill war vs wemen, that euir we may be fre; We suld haue feiris as fresche to fang quhen we wald, And gif all larbaris thair leveis, quhan thai lak curage. My self suld be full semlie with silkis arrayit; Gymp, jolie, and gent, richt joyus, and gentryce, I suld at fairis be found, new faceis to spy; At playis, and preichingis, and pilgrimages greit, To schaw my renoun, royaly, quhair preis was of folk; To manifest my makdome to multitude of pepill, And blaw my bewtie on breid, quhair bernis war mony; That I micht cheis, and be chosin, and change quhen me lykit: Than suld I waill ane full weill, our all the wyd realme, That suld my womanheid weild the lang winter nicht; And when I gottin had ane grume, ganest of vther, ?aip, and ?ing, in the ?ok ane ?eir for to draw; Fra I had preveit his pitht the first plesand moneth, Than suld I cast me to keik in kirk, and in markat, And all the cuntre about, kyngis court, and vther, Quhair I ane galland micht get aganis the nixt ?eir, For to perfurneis furth the werk quhen fail?eit the tother; A forky fure, ay furthwart, and forsy in draucht; Nothir febill, nor fant, nor ful?eit in labour; Bot als fresche of his forme, as flouris in May; For all the fruit suld I fang thocht he the flour burgeoun. [Aude vt dicet de viro suo.] I haue ane wallidrag, ane worme, ane auld wobat carle, A waistit wolroun, na worth bot wourdis to clatter; Ane bumbart, ane dron bee, ane bag full of flewme, Ane skabbit skarth, ane scorpioun, ane scutarde behind; To see him scart his awin skyn grit scunner I think. Quhen kissis me that carybald, than kyndillis all my sorow; As birss of ane brym bair, his berd is als stif, Bot soft and soupill as the silk is his sary lwme: He may weill to the syn assent, bot sakles is his deidis. And gory is his tua grym ene gladderrit all about, And gorgeit lyk twa gutaris that wer with glar stoppit; Bot quhen that glourand gaist grippis me about, Than think I hiddowus Mahoune hes me in armes; Than ma na sanyne me save fra that auld Sathane; For, thocht I cros me all cleine, fra the croun doun, He wil my corse all beclip, et clap [me] to his breist. Quhen schaiffyn is that ald schalk with a scharp rasiour, He schowis on me his schewill mouth, and schedis my lippis; And with his hard hurcheone skyn sa heklis he my chekis, That as a glemand gleyd glowis my chaftis; I schrenk for the scharp stound, bot schout dar I nought, For schore of that auld schrew, schame him betide! The luf-blenkis of that bogill, fra his blerde ene, As Bel?ebub had on me blent, abasit my spreit; And quhen the smy on me smyrkis, with his smake smolet, He feppillis like a farcy aver, that flyrit on a gillot. Quhen that the sound of his saw sinkis in my eris, Than ay renewis my noy, or he be neir cumand: Quhen I heir nemmyt his name, than mak I nyne crocis, To keip me fra the cummerans of that carll mangit, That full of eldnyng is, et anger, et all euill thewis. I dar nought luk to my luf for that lene gib, He is sa full of ielusy, and engyne fals; Euer ymagynyng in mynd materis of evill, Compasand et castand cacis a thousand How he sall tak me, with a trawe, at trist of ane othir: I dar nought keik to the knaip that the cop fillis, For eldnyng of that ald schrew that euer on euill thynkis; For he is waistit, et worne fra Venus werkis, And may nought beit worth a bene in bed of my mystirs. He trowis that ?oung folk I ?erne ?eild, for he gane is, Bot I may ?uke all this ?er, or his ?erd help. Ay quhen that caribald carll wald clym on my wambe, Than am I dangerus, et dane, and dour of my will; ?it leit I neuer that larbar my leggis ga betueene, To fyle my flesche, na fumyll me, without a fee gret; And thoght his pen purly me payis in bed, His purse pays richely in recompense efter: For, or he clym on my corse, that carybald forlane, I haue conditioun of a curche of kersp allther fynest; A govn of engranyt claith, right gaily furrit; A ring with a ryall stane, or other riche iowell, Or rest of his rousty raid, thoght he wer rede [wod]: For all the buddis of Iohne Blunt, quhen he abone clymis, Me think the baid deir aboucht sa bawch ar his werkis; And thus I sell him solace, thoght I it sour think: Fra sic a syre, God ?ow saif, my sueit sisteris deir! Quhen that the semely had said her sentence to end, Than all thai leuch apon loft, with laitis full mery; And raucht the cop round about full off riche wynis, And ral?est lang, or thai wald rest, with ryatus speche. [Hic bibent, et inde vidua interrogat alteram mulierem, et illa respondet, vt sequitur.] The wedo to the tothir wlonk warpit ther wordis; Now, fair sister, fallis ?ow but fen?eing to tell, Sen man ferst with matrimony ?ow menkit in kirk, How haif ?e farne be ?our faith? confese ws the treuth: That band to blise, or to ban, quhilk ?ow best thinkis? Or how ?e like lif to leid in to leill spousage? And syne my self ?e exeme on the samyn wise, And I sall say furth the south, dissymyland no word. The plesand said, I protest, the treuth gif I schaw, That of ?our toungis ?e be traist: The tothir twa grantit; With that sprang vp hir spreit be a span hecher. To speik, quoth scho, I sall nought spar; ther is no spy neir: I sall a ragment reveil fra [the] rute of my hert, A roust that is sa rankild quhill risis my stomok; Now sall the byle all out brist, that beild has [bein] so lang; For it to beir on my brist wes berdin our hevy: I sall the venome devoid with a vent large, And me assuage of the swalme, that suellit wes gret. My husband wes a hur maister, the hugeast in erd, Tharfor, I hait him with my hert, sa help me our Lord! He is a ?oung man ryght ?aip, bot nought in ?outh[is] flouris; For he is fadit full far, and feblit of strenth: He wes as flurising fresche within this few ?eris, Bot he is fal?eid full far, and fal?eid in labour; He has bene lychour so lang quhill lost is his natur, His lwme is vaxit larbar, and lyis into swonne: Wes neuer sugeorne wer set na on that snaill tyrit, For efter seven oulkis rest, it will nought rap anys; He has bene waistit apon wemen, or he me wif chesit, And in adultre, in my tyme, I haif him tane oft: And ?it, he is als brankand with bonet on syde, And blenkand to the brichtest that in the burgh duellis, Alse curtly of his clething, and kemmyng of his hair, As he that is mair val?eand in Venus chalmer; He semys to be sumthing worth, that syphyr in bour, He lukis as he wald luffit be, thocht he be litill of valour; He dois as dotit dog that damys on all bussis, And liftis his leg apon loft, thoght he nought list pische; He has a luke without lust, et lif without curage; He has a forme without force, and fessoun but vertu, And fair wordis but effect, all fruster of dedis; He is for ladyis in luf a right lusty schadow, Bot into derne, at the deid, he salbe drup fundin; He ralis, and makis repet with ryatus wordis, Ay rusing him of his radis, and rageing in chalmer; Bot God wait quhat I think quhen he so thra spekis: And how it settis him so syde to sege of sic materis. Bot gif him self, of sum evin, myght ane say amang thaim, Bot he nought ane is, bot nane of naturis possessoris. Scho that has ane auld man nought all is begylit; He is at Venus werkis na war na he semys: I wend I iosit a gem, and I haif [ane] geit gottin; He had the glemyng of gold, and wes bot glase fundin: Thought men be ferse, wele I fynd, fra fal?e ther curage, Thar is bot eldnyng, or anger ther hertis within. ?e speik of berdis on bewch: of blise may thai sing, That, on sanct Valentynis day, ar vacandis ilk ?er; Hed I that plesand prevelege to part quhen me likit, To change, et ay to cheise agane, than, chastite, adew! Than suld I haif a fresch feir to fang in mynn armes: To hald a freke, quhill he faynt, may foly be callit. Apone sic materis I mus[e], at mydnyght, full oft, And murnys so in my mynd, I murdris my selfin; Than ly I walkand for wa, and walteris about Wariand off my weckit kyn, that me away cast, To sic a craudoune, but curage, that knyt my cler bewte; And ther so mony kene knyghtis this kenrik within: Than think I on a semelyar, the suth for to tell, Na is our syre be sic sevin; with that I sych oft: Than he ful tenderly dois turne to me his twme person, And with a ?oldin ?erd, dois ?olk me in armys; And sais, “My souerane sueit thing, quhy sleip ?e no betir? Me think ther haldin ?ow a hete, as ?e sum harme alyt.” Quoth I, “My hony, hald abak, and handill me nought sair; A hathe is happinit hastely at my hert rut.” With that I seme for to swoune, thought I na swerf tak; And thus beswik I that swane, with my sueit wordis: I cast on him a crabbit E, quhen cleir day is cummyn, And lettis it is a luf-blenk, quhen he about glemys, I turne it in a tender luke, that I in tene warit, And him behaldis hamely, with hertly smyling. I wald a tender peronall, that myght na put thole, That hatit men with hard geir, for hurting of flesch, Had my gud man to hir gest; for I dar God suer, Scho suld not stert for his straik a stray breid of erd. And syne, I wald that ilk band, that ?e so blist call, Had bund him so to that bryght, quhill his bak werkit; And I wer in a beid broght with berne that me likit, I trow, that bird of my blis suld a bourd want. Onone quhen this amyable had endit hir speche, Loudly lauchand the laif allowit hir mekle: Thir gay Wiffis maid game amang the grene leiffis; Thai drank, and did away dule, vnder derne bewis; Thai swapit of the sueit wyne, thai swan-quhit of hewis, Bot all the pertlyar in plane thai put out ther vocis. [Nunc bibent, et inde prime due interrogant viduam, et de sua responsione, et quomodo erat.] Than said the Weido, I vis ther is no way othir; Now tydis me for to talk; my taill it is nixt: God my spreit now inspir, et my speche quykkin, And send me sentence to say, substantious, et noble; Sa, that my preching may pers your perverst hertis, And mak yow mekar to men in manneris and conditiounis. I schaw ?ow, Sisteris in schrift, I wes a schrew euir, Bot I wes schene in my schrowd, et schew me innocent; And thought I dour wes, et dane, dispitois, et bald, I wes dissymblit suttelly in a sanctis liknes: I semyt sober, and sueit, et sempill without fraud, Bot I couth sexty dissaif that suttillar wer haldin. Wnto my lesson ?e lyth, and leir at me wit, Gif yov nought list be forleit with losingeris vntrew: Be constant in ?our gouernance, and counterfeit gud maneris, Thought ?e be kene, inconstant, et cruell of mynd; Thought ?e as tygris be terne, be tretable in luf; And be as turtoris in your talk, thought ?e haif talis brukill; Be dragonis baitht and dowis, ay in double forme, And quhen it nedis ?ow, onone, note baith ther stranthis; Be amyable with humble face, as angellis apperand, And with a terrebill tail be stangand as edderis; Be of ?our luke like innocentis, thoght ?e haif euill myndis; Be courtly ay in clething, et costly arrayit, That hurtis ?ow nought worth a hen; ?owr husband pays for all. Twa husbandis haif I had, thai held me baith deir, Thought I dispytit thaim agane, thai spyit it na thing: Ane wes ane hair hogeart, that hostit out flewme; I hatit him like a hund, thought I it hid preue: With kissing, et with clapping, I gert the carill fon; Weil couth I claw his cruke bak, and kemm his cowit noddill, And with a bukky in my cheik bo on him behind; And with a bek gang about, et bler his ald E; And with a kyind contynance kys his crynd chekis; In to my mynd makand mokis at that mad fader, Trovand me with trew lufe to treit him so fair: This cought I do without dule, et na dises tak, Bot ay be mery in my mynd, and myrthfull of cher. I had a lufsummar leid, my lust for to slokyn, That couth be secrete and sure, and ay saif my honour, And sew bot at certayne tymes, et in sicir placis; Ay when the ald did me anger, with akword wordis, Apon the galland for to goif it gladit me agane. I had sic wit that for wo weipit I [bot] litill; Bot leit the sueit ay the sour to gud sesone bring. Quhen that the chuf wald me chid, with girnand chaftis, I vald him chuk, cheik et chyn, et cheris him so mekill; That his cheif chymys [he] had chevist to my sone, Suppos the churll wes gane chaist, or the child wes gottin: As wis woman ay I wrought, et not as wod fule, For mar with wylis I wan na wichtnes of handis. Syne maryit I a marchand, myghti of gudis: He was a man of myd eld, et of mene statur; Bot we na fallowis wer in frendschip and blud, In fredome, na furth bering, na fairnes of persoune; Quhilk ay the fule did for?et, for febilnes of knawlege; Bot I sa oft thoght him on quhill angrit his hert, And quhilum I put furth my voce, et Pedder him callit: I wald ryght tuichand [in] talk be, I wes tuyse maryit, For endit wes my innocence with my ald husband: I wes apperand to be pert within perfit eild; Sa sais the curat of our kirk, that knew me full ?ing: He is our famous to be fals, that fair worthy prelot; I salbe laith to lat him le, quhill I may luke furth. I gert the buthman obey, ther wes no bute ellis; He maid me ryght hie reverens, fra he my rycht knew: For, thocht I say it my self, the seuerance wes mekle, Betuix his bastard blude, et my birth noble. That page wes neuer of sic price for to presome anys Wnto my persone to be peir, had pete nought grantit. Bot mercy in to womanheid is a mekle vertu: For neuer bot in a gentill hert is generit ony ruth. I held ay grene in to his mynd that I of grace tuk him, And for he couth ken him self I curtasly him lerit: He durst not sit anys my summondis; for, or the secund charge, He wes ay redy for to ryn; so rad he wes for blame. Bot ay my will wes the war of womanly natur; The mair he loutit for my luf, the les of him I rakit; And eik, this is a ferly thing, or I him faith gaif, I had sic favour to that freke, and feid syne for euer. Quhen I the cure had all clene, et him ourcummyn haill, I crew abone that craudone, as cok that wer wictour; Quhen I him saw subiect, and sett at myn bydding, Than I him lichtlyit as a lowne, et lathit his maneris. Than woxe I sa vnmerciable to martir him I thought, For, as a best, I broddit him to all boyis laubour: I wald haif ridden him to Rome, with [ane] raip in his heid, Wer not ruffill of my renovne, et rumour of pepill. And ?it hatrent I hid within my hert all; Bot quhilis it hepit so huge, quhill it behud out: ?it tuk I neuir the wosp clene out of my wyde throte, Quhill I oucht wantit of my will, or quhat I wald desir. Bot quhen I seuerit had that syre of substance in erd; And gottin his biggingis to my barne, et hie burrow landis; Than with a stew stert out the stoppell of my hals, That he all stwnyst throu the stound, as of a stele wappin. Than wald I, efter lang, first sa fane haif bene wrokin, That I to flyte wes als fers as a fell dragoun. I had for flattering of that fule fen?eit so lang, Mi euidentis of heritagis or thai wer all selit; My breist that wes gret beild, bowdyn wes sa huge, That neir my baret out brist or the band makin; Bot quhen my billis, and my bauthles wes all braid selit, I wald na langar beir on bridill, bot braid vp my heid; Thar myght na molet mak me moy, na hald my mouth in: I gert the ren?eis rak, et rif into sondir; I maid that wif carll to werk all womenis werkis, And laid all manly materis, and mensk in this eird. Than said I, to my cumaris, in counsall about, “Se how I cabeld ?one cout with a kene brydill! The cappill, that the crelis kest in the caf mydding, Sa curtasly the cart drawis, and kennis na plungeing, He is nought skeich, na ?it sker, na scippis nought on syd:” And thus the scorne and the scaith scapit he nothir. He wes no glaidsum gest for a gay lady, Tharfor, I gat him a game that ganyt him bettir; He wes a gret goldit man, et of gudis riche; I leit him be my lumbart to lous me all misteris, And he wes fane for to fang fra me that fair office, And thoght my favoris to fynd through his feill giftis. He grathit me in a gay silk, et gudly arrayis; In gownis of engranyt claight, et gret goldin chen?eis; In ringis ryally set with riche ruby stonis, Quhill hely raise my renovne amang the rude peple; Bot I full craftely did keip thai courtly wedis, Quhill eftir dede of that drupe, that docht nought in chalmir: Thought he of all my clathis maid cost et expense, Ane othir sall the worschip haif, that weildis me eftir; And thoght I likit him bot litill, ?it for [the] luf of otheris, I wald me prun?a plesandly in precius wedis, That luffaris myght apon me luke, and ?ing lusty gallandis, That I held more in daynte, et derer be ful mekill, Ne him that dressit me so dink: full dotit wes his heyd. Quhen he wes heryit out of hand, to hie vp my honoris, And payntit me as pako, proudest of fedderis, I him miskennyt, be Crist; et cukkald him maid; I him forleit as a lad, and lathlyit him mekle: I thoght my self a papingay, et him a plukit herle; All thus enforsit he his fa, et fortifyit in strenth, And maid a stalwart staff to strik him selfe doune. Bot of ane bowrd in to bed I sall ?ow breif ?it: Quhen he ane hail ?ear wes hanyt, and him behuffit rage, And I wes laith to be loppin with sic a lob avoir, Alse lang as he wes on loft, I lukit on him neuer; Na leit neuer enter in my thoght that he my thing persit. Bot ay in mynd ane other man ymagynit that I haid; Or ellis had I neuer mery bene at that myrthles raid. Quhen I that grome geldit had of gudis, and of natur, Me thought him gracelese on to goif, sa me God help: Quhen he had warit all on me his welth, et his substance, Me thoght his wit wes all went away with the laif; And so I did him despise, I spittit quhen I saw That super spendit euill spreit, spvl?eit of all vertu. For, weill ?e wait, wiffis, that he that wantes riches, And val?eandnes in Venus play, is ful vile haldin: Full fruster is his fresch array, et fairnes of persoune, All is bot frutlese his effeir, and fal?eis at the vp-with. I buskit vp my barnis like baronis sonnis, And maid bot fulis of the fry of his first wif: I banyst fra my boundis his brethir ilkane; His frendis as my fais I held at feid evir; Be this, ?e belief may, I luffit nought him self, For neuer I likit a leid that langit till his blude: And ?it thir wisemen, thai wait that all wiffis euill Ar kend with ther conditionis, et knawin with the samin. Deid is now that dyvour, et dollin in erd: With him deit all my dule, et my drery thoghtis; Now done is my dolly nyght, my day is vpsprungin, Adew dolour, adew! my daynte now begynis: Now am I a wedow, I wise, and weill am at ese; I weip as I wer woful, bot wel is me for euer; I busk as I wer bailfull, bot blith is my hert; My mouth it makis murnyng, et my mynd lauchis; My clokis thai ar caerfull in colour of sabill; Bot courtly and ryght curyus my corse is ther vndir: I drup with a ded luke, in my dule habit, As with manis daill [I] had done for dayis of my lif. Quhen that I go to the kirk, cled in cair weid, As foxe in a lambis fleise fen?e I my cheir; Than lay I furtgh my bright buke on breid on my kne, With mony lusty letter ellummynit with gold; And drawis my clok forthwart our my face quhit, That I may spy, vnaspyit, a space me beside: Full oft I blenk by my buke, et blynis of deuotioun, To se quhat berne is best brand, or bredest in schulderis, Or forgeit is maist forcely, to furnyse a bancat In Venus chalmer, val?eandly, withoutin vane ruse: And, as the new mone, all pale, oppressit with change, Kythis quhilis her cleir face, through cluddis of sable, So keik I through my clokis, and castis kynd lukis To knychtis, and to cleirkis, and courtly personis. Quhen frendis of my husbandis behaldis me on fer, I haif a water spunge for wa, within my wyde clokis, Than wring I it full wylely, et wetis my chekis; With that wateris myn ene, and welteris doune teris. Than say thai all, that sittis about, “Se ?e nought, allace! ?one lustlese led so lelely scho luffit hir husband: ?one is a pete to enprent in a princis hert, That sic a perle of plesance suld ?one pane dre!” I sane me as I war ane sanct, et semys ane angell; At langage of lichory I leit as I war crabit: I sich, without sair hert, or seiknes in body; According to my sable weid I mon haif sad maneris, Or thai will se all the suth; for certis, we wemen We set us all fra the syght to syle men of treuth: We dule for na euill deid, sa it be derne haldin. Wise women has wayis, and wonderfull gydingis With gret engyne to beiaip ther ielyus husbandis; And quyetly, with sic craft, convoyis our materis That, vnder Crist, no creatur kennis of our doingis. Bot folk a cury may miscuke, that knawledge wantis, And has na colouris for to cover thair awne kindly favtis; As dois thir damysellis, for derne dotit lufe, That dogonis haldis in dainte, et delis with thaim so lang, Quhill all the cuntre knaw ther kyndnes, et faith: Faith has a fair name, bot falsheid faris bettir: Fy on hir that can nought feyne her fame for to saif! ?it am I wise in sic werk, et wes all my tyme; Thoght I want wit in warldlynes, I wylis haif in luf, As ony happy woman has that is of hie blude: Hutit be the halok lase a hunder ?eir of eild! I have ane secrete serwand, rycht sobir of his toung, That me supportis of sic nedis, quhen I a syne mak: Thoght he be sympill to the sicht, he has a tong sickir; Full mony semelyar sege wer service dois mak: Thought I haif cair, vnder cloke, the cleir day quhill nyght, ?it haif I solace, vnder serk, quhill the sone ryse. ?it, am I haldin a haly wif our all the haill schyre, I am sa peteouse to the pur, quhen ther [is] personis mony In passing of pilgrymage I pride me full mekle, Mair for the prese of peple, na ony perdoun wynyng. Bot ?it, me think, the best bourd, quhen baronis and knychtis, And othir bachilleris, blyth blwmyng in ?outh, And all my luffaris lele, my lugeing persewis, And fillis me wyne wantonly, with weilfair et ioy: Sum rownis; and sum ral?eis; and sum redis ballatis; Sum raiffis furght rudly with riatus speche; Sum plenis, and sum prayis; sum prasis mi bewte, Sum kissis me; sum clappis me; sum kyndnes me proferis; Sum kerffis to me curtasli; sum me the cop giffis; Sum stalwardly steppis ben, with a stout curage, And a stif standand thing staiffis in my neiff; And mony blenkis ben our, that but full fer sittis, That mai nought, for the thik thrang, thrif as thai wald. Bot, with my fair calling, I comfort thaim all: For he that sittis me nixt, I nip on his finger; I serf him on the tothir syde on the samin fasson; And he that behind me [sittis], I hard on him lene; And him befor, with my fut fast on his I stramp; And to the bernis far but sueit blenkis I cast: To euery man in speciall speke I sum wordis, So wisly, and so womanly, quhill warmys ther hertis. Thar is no liffand leid so law of degre That sall me luf vnluffit, I am so loik hertit; And gif his lust so be lent, into my lyre quhit, That he be lost or with me lig, his lif sall nocht [haif] danger; I am so mercifull in mynd, et menys all wichtis, My sely saull salbe saif, quhen sa bot all iugis.

Than culit thai thair mouthis with confortable drinkis; And carpit full cummerlik, with cop going round. Thus draif thai our that deir night, with danceis full noble, Quhill that the day did vp daw, et dew donkit the flouris; The morow myld wes et meik, the mavis did sing, And all remuffit the myst, et the meid smellit; Siluer schouris doune schuke, as the schene cristall, And berdis schoutit in schaw, with thair schill notis; The goldin glitterand gleme, so gladit ther hertis, Thai maid a glorius gle amang the grene bewis. The soft souch of the swyr, et sovne of the stremys, The sueit sawour of the sward, [and] singing of foulis, Myght confort ony creatur of the kyn of Adam; And kindill agane his curage thocht it wer cald sloknyt. Than rais thir ryall roisis, in ther riche wedis, And rakit hame to ther rest, through the rise blwmys; And I all prevely past to a plesand arber, And with my pen did report thair pastance most mery. ?e Auditoris, most honorable, that eris has gevin Onto this vncouth aventur, quhilk airly me happinnit; Of ther thre wantoun wiffis, that I haif writtin heir, Quhilk wald ?e vvaill to ?our vvif, gif ?e suld vved one?

HERMES THE PHILOSOPHER. Be mirry and glaid, honest and vertewous, Ffor that suffisis to anger the invyous.

Thow seis thir wrechis sett with sorrow and cair, To gaddir gudis in all thair lyvis space, And quhen thair baggis ar full thair selfis ar bair, And of thair richess bot the keping hess; Quhill vthiris cum to spend it that hes grace, Quhilk of thy wynning no labour had nor cure; Tak thow example and spend with mirriness: Without glaidnes availis no tresour.

THE DANCE [OF THE SEVIN DEIDLY SYNNIS.] Off Februar the fyiftene nycht, Full lang befoir the dayis lycht, I lay in till a trance; And then I saw baith hevin and hell: Me thocht, amangis the feyndis fell, Mahoun gart cry ane dance Off schrewis that wer nevir schrevin, Aganiss the feist of Fasternis evin, To mak thair observance; He bad gallandis ga graith a gyiss, And kast vp gamountis in the skyiss, That last came out of France. “Lat se,” quod he, “Now quha begynnis;” With that the fowll Sevin Deidly Synnis Begowth to leip at anis. And first of all in dance wes Pryd, Pryd. With bair wyld bak and bonet on syd, Lyk to mak vaistie wanis; And round abowt him, as a quheill, Hang all in rumpillis to the heill His kethat for the nanis: Mony prowd trumpour with him trippit Throw skaldand fyre, ay as thay skippit Thay gyrnd with hiddouss granis. Heilie harlottis on hawtane wyiss Come in with mony sindrie gyiss, Bot ?it luche nevir Mahoun; Quhill preistis come in with bair schevin nekkis, Than all the feyndis lewche, and maid gekkis, Blak Belly and Bawsy Brown. Yre.Than Yre come in with sturt and stryfe; His hand wes ay vpoun his knyfe, He brandeist lyk a beir: Bostaris, braggaris, and barganeris, Eftir him passit in to pairis, All bodin in feir of weir; In iakkis, and stryppis and bonettis of steill, Thair leggis wer chen?eit to the heill, Ffrawart wes thair affeir: Sum vpoun vdir with brandis beft, Sum jaggit vthiris to the heft, With knyvis that scherp cowd scheir. Invy.Nixt in the dance followit Invy, Fild full of feid and fellony, Hid malyce and dispyte; Ffor pryvie hatrent that tratour trymlit. Him followit mony freik dissymlit, With fen?eit wirdis quhyte; And flattereris in to menis facis; And bakbyttaris of sindry racis, To ley that had delyte; And rownaris of fals lesingis; Allace! that courtis of noble kingis Of thame can nevir be quyte. Nixt him in dans come Cuvatyce, Auaryce. Rute of all evill and grund of vyce, That nevir cowd be content; Catyvis, wrechis and okkeraris, Hud-pykis, hurdaris and gadderaris, All with that warlo went: Out of thair throttis thay schot on vdder Hett moltin gold, me thocht a fudder, As fyreflawcht maist fervent; Ay as thay tomit thame of schot, Ffeyndis fild thame new vp to the thrott With gold of allkin prent. Syne Sweirnes, at the secound bidding, Sueirnes. Come lyk a sow out of a midding, Full slepy wes his grun?ie: Mony sweir bumbard belly huddroun, Mony slute daw and slepy duddroun, Him serwit ay with soun?ie; He drew thame furth in till a chen?ie, And Belliall, with a brydill ren?ie, Evir lascht thame on the lun?ie: In dance thay war so slaw of feit, Thay gaif thame in the fyre a heit, And maid thame quicker of coun?ie. Lichery.Than Lichery, that lathly corss, Berand lyk a bagit horss, And Ydilness did him leid; Thair wes with him ane vgly sort, And mony stynkand fowll tramort, That had in syn bene deid. Quhen thay wer entrit in the dance, Thay wer full strenge of countenance, Lyk turkass birnand reid; All led thay vthir by the tersis, Suppoiss thay fycket with thair ersis, It mycht be na remeid. Gluttony.Than the fowll monstir Glutteny, Off wame vnsasiable and gredy, To dance he did him dress: Him followit mony fowll drunckart, With can and collep, cop and quart, In surffet and excess; Full mony a waistless wallydrag, With wamiss vnweildable, did furth wag, In creische that did incress; Drynk! ay thay cryit, with mony a gaip, The feyndis gaif thame hait leid to laip, Thair lovery wes na less. Na menstrallis playit to thame but dowt, Ffor glemen thair wer haldin owt, Be day, and eik by nycht; Except a menstrall that slew a man, Swa till his heretage he wan, And entirt be breif of richt. Than cryd Mahoun for a Heleand pad?ane; Syne ran a feynd to feche Makfad?ane, Ffar northwart in a nuke; Be he the correnoch had done schout, Erschemen so gadderit him abowt, In Hell grit rowme thay tuke. Thae tarmegantis, with tag and tatter, Ffull lowd in Ersche begowth to clatter, And rowp lyk revin and ruke: The Devill sa devit wes with thair ?ell, That in the depest pot of hell He smorit thame with smvke. XXVII. THE TURNAMENT. Nixt that a turnament wes tryid, That lang befoir in hell wes cryid, In presens of Mahoun; Betuix a tel?our and ane sowtar, A pricklouss and ane hobbell clowttar, The barress wes maid boun. The tail?eour, baith with speir and scheild, Convoyit wes vnto the feild, With mony lymmar loun, Off seme byttaris and beist knapparis, Off stomok steillaris and clayth takkaris, A graceless garisoun. His baner born wes him befoir, Quhairin wes clowttis ane hundreth scoir, Ilk ane of diuerss hew; And all stowin out of sindry webbis, For, quhill the Greik sie flowis and ebbis, Tel?ouris will nevir be trew. The tail?our on the barrowis blent, Allaiss! he tynt all hardyment, Ffor feir he chaingit hew: Mahoun come furth and maid him knycht, Na ferly thocht his hart wes licht, That to sic honor grew. The tail?eour hecht hely befoir Mahoun, That he suld ding the sowtar doun, Thocht he wer strang as mast; Bot quhen he on the barrowis blenkit, The tel?ouris hairt a littill schrenkit, His hairt did all ourcast. Quhen to the sowtar he did cum, Off all sic wirdis he wes full dum, So soir he wes agast; In harte he tuke ?it sic ane scunner, Ane rak of fartis lyk ony thunner, Went fra him, blast for blast. The sowtar to the feild him drest, He wes convoyid out of the west, As ane defender stout: Suppoiss he had na lusty varlot, He had full mony lowsy harlott, Round rynnand him aboute, His baner wes of barkit hyd, Quhairin Sanct Girnega did glyd, Befoir that rebald rowt: Ffull sowttar lyk he wes of laitis, For ay betuix the harness plaitis The vly birstit out. Quhen on the tel?our he did luke, His hairt a littill dwamyng tuke, He mycht nocht rycht vpsitt; In to his stommok wes sic ane steir, Off all his dennar quhilk he coft deir His breist held deill a bitt. To comfort him, or he raid forder, The Devill off knychtheid gaif him order; For sair syne he did spitt, And he about the Devillis nek Did spew agane ane quart of blek, Thuss knychtly he him quitt. Than fourty tymis the Feynd cryd, Fy! The sowtar rycht effeiritly Vnto the feild he socht: Quhen thay wer serwit of thair speiris, Ffolk had ane feill be thair effeiris, Thair hairtis wer baith on flocht. Thay spurrit thair horss on adir syd, Syne thay attour the grund cowd glyd, Than thame togidder brocht; The tail?eour that wes nocht weill sittin, He left his sadill all beschittin, And to the grund he socht. His harnass brak and maid ane brattill, The sowtaris horss scart with the rattill, And round about cowd reill; The beist that frayit wes rycht evill, Ran with the sowtar to the Devill, And he rewardit him weill. Sum thing frome him the Feynd eschewit, He went agane to bene bespewit, So stern he wes in steill: He thocht he wald agane debait him, He turnd his erss and all bedret him, Evin quyte from nek till heill. He lowsit it of with sic a reird, Baith horss and man he straik till eird, He fartit with sic ane feir; “Now haif I quitt the,” quod Mahoun; Thir new maid knychtis lay bayth in swoun, And did all armes mensweir. The Devill gart thame to dungeoun dryve, And thame of knychtheid cold depryve, Dischairgeing thame of weir; And maid thame harlottis bayth for evir, Quhilk still to keip thay had fer levir, Nor ony armes beir. I had mair of thair werkis writtin, Had nocht the sowtar bene beschittin, With Belliallis erss vnblist; Bot that sa gud ane bourd me thocht, Sic solace to my hairt it rocht, For lawchtir neir I brist; Quhairthrow I walknit of my trance. To put this in rememberance, Mycht no man me resist, Ffor this said justing it befell Befoir Mahoun, the air of hell: Now trow thiss gif ?e list. Heir endis the sowtar and tail?ouris war, Maid be the nobill poyet Mr William Dumbar. XXVIII. FFOLLOWIS THE AMENDIS MADE BE HIM TO THE TEL?OURIS AND SOWTARIS FOR THE TURNAMENT MAID ON THAME. Betuix twell houris and ellevin, I dremed ane angell came fra Hevin, With plesand stevin sayand on hie, Tel?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. In Hevin hie ordand is ?our place, Aboif all sanctis in grit solace, Nixt God, grittest in dignitie: Tail?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. The causs to ?ow is nocht vnkend, That God mismakkis ?e do amend, Be craft and grit agilitie: Tail?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. Sowtaris, with schone weill maid and meit, ?e mend the faltis of ill maid feit, Quhairfoir to Hevin ?our saulis will fle; Tel?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. Is nocht in all this fair a flyrok, That hes vpoun his feit a wyrok, Knowll tais, nor mowlis in no degrie, Bot ?e can hyd thame: blist be ?e. And ?e tail?ouris, with weilmaid clais Can mend the werst maid man that gais, And mak him semely for to se: Tel?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. Thocht God mak ane misfassonit man, ?e can him all schaip new agane, And fassoun him bettir be sic thre: Tel?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. Thocht a man haif a brokin bak, Haif he a gude crafty tel?our, quhattrak, That can it cuver with craftis slie: Tel?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. Off God grit kyndness may ?e clame, That helpis his peple fra cruke and lame, Supportand faltis with ?our supple: Tail?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. In erd ?e kyth sic mirakillis heir, In Hevin ?e salbe sanctis full cleir, Thocht ?e be knavis in this cuntre: Tel?ouris and Sowtaris, blist be ?e. Quod Dumbar. XXIX. [SANCT SALUATOUR! SEND SILUER SORROW.] Sanct Saluatour! send siluer sorrow; It grevis me both evin and morrow, Chasing fra me all cheritie; It makis me all blythness to borrow; My panefull purss so pricliss me. Quhen I wald blythlie ballattis breif, Langour thairto givis me no leif; War nocht gud howp my hart vphie, My verry corpis for cair wald cleif; My panefull purss so prikillis me. Quhen I sett me to sing or dance, Or go to plesand pastance, Than pansing of penuritie Revis that fra my remembrance; My panefull purss so prikillis me. Quhen men that hes purssis in tone, Passis to drynk or to disione, Than mon I keip ane grauetie, And say, that I will fast quhill none; My panefull purss so pricliss me. My purss is maid of sic ane skyn, Thair will na corss byd it within; Fra it as fra the Feynd thay fle, Quha evir tyne, quha evir win; My panefull purss so pricliss me. Had I ane man of ony natioun Culd mak on it ane coniuratioun, To gar siluer ay in it be, The Devill suld haif no dominatioun, With pyne to gar it prickill me. I haif inquyrit in mony a place, For help and confort in this cace, And all men sayis, My Lord, that ?e Can best remeid for this malice, That with sic panis prickillis me. Quod Dumbar to the King. XXX. FFOLLOWIS HOW DUMBAR WES DESYRD TO BE ANE FREIR. This nycht befoir the dawing cleir, Me thocht Sanct Francis did to me appeir, With ane religiouss abbeit in his hand, And said, “In thiss go cleith the my serwand; Reffuss the warld, for thow mon be a freir.” With him and with his abbeit bayth I skarrit, Lyk to ane man that with a gaist wes marrit: Me thocht on bed he layid it me abone, Bot on the flure delyuerly and sone I lap thairfra, and nevir wald cum nar it. Quoth he, “Quhy skarris thow with this holy weid? Cleith the thairin, for weir it thow most neid; Thow, that hes lang done Venus lawis teiche, Sall now be freir, and in this abbeit preiche; Delay it nocht, it mon be done but dreid.” Quod I, “Sanct Francis, loving be the till, And thankit mot thow be of thy gude will To me, that of thy clayis ar so kynd; Bot thame to weir it nevir come in my mynd; Sweit Confessour, thow tak it nocht in ill. In haly legendis haif I hard allevin, Ma sanctis of bischoppis, nor freiris, be sic sevin; Off full few freiris that hes bene sanctis I reid; Quhairfoir ga bring to me ane bischopis weid, Gife evir thow wald my saule gaid vnto Hevin. My brethir oft hes maid the supplicationis, Be epistillis, sermonis, and relationis, To tak the abyte, bot thow did postpone; But ony process, cum on thairfoir annone, All sircumstance put by and excusationis. Gif evir my fortoun wes to be a freir, The dait thairof is past full mony a ?eir; For into every lusty toun and place Off all Yngland, frome Berwick to Kalice, I haif in to thy habeit maid gud cheir. In freiris weid full fairly haif I fleichit, In it haif I in pulpet gon and preichit In Derntoun kirk, and eik in Canterberry; In it I past at Dover our the ferry Throw Piccardy, and thair the peple teichit. Als lang as I did beir the freiris style, In me, God wait, wes mony wrink and wyle; In me wes falset with every wicht to flatter, Quhilk mycht be flemit with na haly watter; I wes ay reddy all men to begyle. This freir that did Sanct Francis thair appeir, Ane fieind he wes in liknes of ane freir; He vaneist away with stynk and fyrie smowk; With him me thocht all the houshend he towk, And I awoik as wy that wes in weir. Quod Dumbar. XXXI. [HE THAT HES GOLD AND GRIT RICHESS.] He that hes gold and grit richess, And may be into mirryness, And dois glaidness fra him expell, And levis in to wrechitness, He wirkis sorrow to him sell. He that may be but sturt or stryfe, And leif ane lusty plesand lyfe, And syne with mariege dois him mell, And bindis him with ane wicket wyfe, He wirkis sorrow to him sell. He that hes for his awin gen?ie Ane plesand prop, but mank or men?ie, And schuttis syne at ane vncow schell, And is forfairn with the fleis of Spen?ie, He wirkis sorrow to him sell. And he that with gud lyfe and trewth, But varians or vder slewth, Dois evir mair with ane maister dwell, That nevir of him will haif no rewth, He wirkis sorrow to him sell. Now all this tyme lat ws be mirry, And sett nocht by this warld a chirry: Now quhill thair is gude wyne to sell, He that dois on dry breid virry, I gif him to the Devill of hell. Quod Dumbar. XXXII. THE WOWING OF THE KING QUHEN HE WES IN DUMFERMELING. This hindir nycht in Dumfermeling, To me wes tawld ane windir thing; That lait ane tod wes with ane lame, And with hir playit, and maid gude game, Syne till his breist did hir imbrace, And wald haif riddin hir lyk ane rame: And that me thocht ane ferly cace. He braisit hir bony body sweit, And halsit hir with [his] fordir feit; Syne schuk his taill, with quhinge and ?elp, And todlit with hir lyk ane quhelp; Syne lowrit on growfe and askit grace; And ay the lame cryd, Lady, help! And that me thocht ane ferly cace. The tod wes nowder lene nor skowry, He wes ane lusty reid haird lowry, Ane lang taild beist and grit with all; The silly lame wes all to small To sic ane tribbill to hald ane bace: Scho fled him nocht; ffair mot hir fall! And that me thocht ane ferly cace. The tod wes reid, the lame wes quhyte, Scho wes ane morsall of delyte; He lovit na ?owis auld, twch and sklender: Becaus this lame wes ?ung and tender, He ran vpoun hir with a race, And scho schup nevir for till defend hir: And thiss me thocht ane ferly cace. He grippit hir abowt the west, And handlit hir as he had hest; This innocent that nevir trespast, Tuke hert that scho wes handlit fast, And lute him kiss hir lusty face; His girnand gamis hir nocht agast: And that me thocht ane ferly cace.

As ?ung Awrora, with cristall haile, In orient schew hir visage paile, A sweuyng swyth did me assaile, Off sonis of Sathanis seid; Me thocht a Turk of Tartary Come throw the boundis of Barbary, And lay forloppin in Lumbardy, Ffull lang in waithman weid. Ffra baptasing for to eschew, Thair a religious man he slew, And cled him in his abeit new, Ffor he cowth wryte and reid. Quhen kend was his dissimvlance, And all his cursit govirnance, Ffor feir he fled and come in France, With littill of Lumbard leid. To be a leiche he fenyt him thair, Quhilk mony a man micht rew evirmair; For he left nowthir seik nor sair Vnslane, or he hyne ?eid. Vane organis he full clenely carvit, Quhen of his straik so mony starvit, Dreid he had gottin that he desarvit, He fled away gud speid. In Scotland than, the narrest way He come, his cunnyng till assay; To sum man thair it was no play The preving of his sciens. In pottingry he wrocht grit pyne, He murdreist mony in medecyne; The jow was of a grit engyne, And generit was of gyans. In leichecraft he was homecyd, He wald haif, for a nicht to byd, A haiknay and the hurtmanis hyd, So meikle he was of myance. His yrnis was rude as ony rawchtir, Quhair he leit blude it was no lawchtir, Full mony instrument for slawchtir Was in his gardevyance. He cowth gif cure for laxatyve; To gar a wicht horss want his lyve, Quha evir assay wald, man or wyve, Thair hippis ?eid hiddy giddy. His practikis nevir war put to preif, But suddane deid, or grit mischeif; He had purgatioun to mak a theif To dee withowt a widdy. Vnto no mess pressit this prelat, For sound of sacring bell nor skellat; As blaksmyth bruikit was his pallatt, Ffor battering at the study. Thocht he come hame a new maid channoun, He had dispensit with matynnis channoun, On him come nowthir stole nor fannoun, Ffor smowking of the smydy. Me thocht seir fassonis he assail?eit, To mak the quintessance, and fail?eit; And quhen he saw that nocht avail?eit, A fedrem on he tuke, And schupe in Turky for to fle; And quhen that he did mont on he, All fowill ferleit quhat he sowld be, That evir did on him luke. Sum held he had bene Dedalus, Sum the Menatair marvelus, Sum the Martis smyth Wlcanus, And sum Saturnus kuke. And evir the cuschettis at him tuggit, The rukis him rent, the ravynis him druggit, The hudit crawis his hair furth ruggit, The hevin he micht not bruke. The myttane, and Sanct Martynis fowle, Wend he had bene the hornit howle, Thay set avpone him with a ?owle, And gaif him dynt for dynt. The golk, the gormaw, and the gled, Beft him with buffettis quhill he bled; The sparhalk to the spring him sped, Als fers as fyre of flynt. The tarsall gaif him tug for tug, A stanchell hang in ilka lug, The pyot furth his pennis did rug, The stork straik ay but stynt. The bissart, bissy but rebuik, Scho was so cleverus of hir clvik, His bawis he micht not langer bruik, Scho held thame at ane hint. Thik was the clud of kayis and crawis, Of marle?onis, mittanis, and of mawis, That bikkrit at his berd with blawis In battell him abowt. Thay nybbillit him with noyis and cry, The rerd of thame raiss to the sky, And evir he cryit on Fortoun, Fy! His lyfe was in to dowt. The ja him skrippit with a skryke, And skornit him as it was lyk; The egill strong at him did stryke, And rawcht him mony a rowt. Ffor feir vncunnandly he cawkit, Quhill all his pennis war drownd and drawkit, He maid a hundreth nolt all hawkit Beneth him with a spowt. He schewre his feddreme that was schene, And slippit owt of it full clene, And in a myre, vp to the ene, Amang the glar did glyd. The fowlis all at the fedrem dang, As at a monster thame amang, Quhill all the pennis of it owsprang In till the air full wyde. And he lay at the plunge evirmair, Sa lang as any ravin did rair; The crawis him socht with cryis of cair In every schaw besyde. Had he reveild bene to the rwikis, Thay had him revin all with thair clwikis: Thre dayis in dub amang the dukis He did with dirt him hyde. The air was dirkit with the fowlis, That come with ?awmeris and with ?owlis, With skryking, skrymming and with scowlis, To tak him in the tyde. I walknit with the noyis and schowte, So hiddowis beir was me abowte; Sensyne I curss that cankerit rowte Quhair evir I go or ryde. Ffinis quod Dumbar. XXXIV.

Lo, fresche Flora hes flurest every spray, As natur hes hir taucht, the noble quene, The feild bene clothit in a new array; A lusty lyfe in luvis scheruice bene. Nevir suetar noys wes hard with levand man, Na maid this mirry gentill nychtingaill, Hir sound went with the rever as it ran, Outthrow the fresche and flureist lusty vaill. “O merle,” quod scho, “O fule, stynt of thy taill, For in thy song gud sentens is thair none, For boith is tynt the tyme and the travaill Of every luve bot vpone God allone.” “Seiss,” quod the merle, “thy preching, nychtingale, Sall folk thair ?ewth spend in-to holiness?

Quhen Merche wes with variand windis past And Appryll had, with hir siluer schouris, Tane leif at nature with ane orient blast; And lusty May, that mvddir is of flouris, Had maid the birdis to begyn thair houris Amang the tendir odouris reid and quhyt, Quhois armony to heir it wes delyt; In bed at morrow, sleiping as I lay, Me thocht Aurora, with hir cristall ene, In at the window lukit by the day, And halsit me, with visage paill and grene; On quhois hand a lark sang fro the splene, Awalk, luvaris, out of your slomering, Se how the lusty morrow dois vp spring. Me thocht fresche May befoir my bed vpstude, In weid depaynt of mony diuerss hew, Sobir, benyng, and full of mansuetude, In brycht atteir of flouris forgit new, Hevinly of color, quhyt, reid, broun and blew, Balmit in dew, and gilt with Phebus bemys, Quhill all the houss illumynit of hir lemys. “Slugird,” scho said, “awalk annone for schame, And in my honour sum thing thow go wryt; The lork hes done the mirry day proclame, To raiss vp luvaris with confort and delyt, ?it nocht incressis thy curage to indyt, Quhois hairt sum tyme hes glaid and blisfull bene, Sangis to mak vndir the levis grene.” “Quhairto,” quod I, “sall I vpryss at morrow, For in this May few birdis herd I sing? Thai haif moir causs to weip and plane thair sorrow, Thy air it is nocht holsum nor benyng; Lord Eolus dois in thy sessone ring; So busteous ar the blastis of his horne, Amang thy bewis to walk I haif forborne.” With that this lady sobirly did smyll, And said, “Vpryss, and do thy observance; Thow did promyt, in Mayis lusty quhyle, For to discryve the Ross of most plesance. Go se the birdis how thay sing and dance, Illumynit our with orient skyis brycht, Annamyllit richely with new asur lycht.” Quhen this wes said, depairtit scho, this quene, And enterit in a lusty gairding gent; And than, me thocht, full hestely besene, In serk and mantill [eftir hir] I went In to this garth, most dulce and redolent Off herb and flour, and tendir plantis sueit, And grene levis doing of dew doun fleit. The purpour sone, with tendir bemys reid, In orient bricht as angell did appeir, Throw goldin skyis putting vp his heid, Quhois gilt tressis schone so wondir cleir, That all the world tuke confort, fer and neir, To luke vpone his fresche and blisfull face, Doing all sable fro the hevynnis chace. And as the blisfull sonne of cherarchy The fowlis song throw confort of the licht; The birdis did with oppin vocis cry, O, luvaris fo, away thow dully nycht, And welcum day that confortis every wicht; Haill May, haill Flora, haill Aurora schene, Haill princes Natur, haill Venus luvis quene. Dame Nature gaif ane inhibitioun thair To ferss Neptunus, and Eolus the bawld, Nocht to perturb the wattir nor the air, And that no schouris, nor blastis cawld, Effray suld flouris nor fowlis on the fold; Scho bad eik Juno, goddes of the sky, That scho the hevin suld keip amene and dry. Scho ordand eik that every bird and beist Befoir hir hienes suld annone compeir, And every flour of vertew, most and leist, And every herb be feild fer and neir, As thay had wont in May, fro ?eir to ?eir, To hir thair makar to mak obediens, Full law inclynnand with all dew reuerens. With that annone scho send the swyft Ro To bring in beistis of all conditioun; The restles Suallow commandit scho also To feche all fowll of small and greit renown; And to gar flouris compeir of all fassoun, Full craftely conjurit scho the Yarrow, Quhilk did furth swirk als swift as ony arrow. All present wer in twynkling of ane e, Baith beist, and bird and flour, befoir the quene, And first the Lyone, gretast of degre, Was callit thair, and he, most fair to sene, With a full hardy contenance and kene, Befoir dame Natur come, and did inclyne, With visage bawld, and curage leonyne. This awfull beist full terrible wes of cheir, Persing of luke, and stout of countenance, Rycht strong of corpis, of fassoun fair, but feir, Lusty of schaip, lycht of deliuerance, Reid of his cullour, as is the ruby glance; On feild of gold he stude full mychtely, With flour delycis sirculit lustely. This lady liftit vp his cluvis cleir, And leit him listly lene vpone hir kne, And crownit him with dyademe full deir, Off radyous stonis, most ryall for to se; Saying, “The King of Beistis mak I the, And the cheif protector in woddis and schawis; Onto thi leigis go furth, and keip the lawis. Exerce justice with mercy and conscience, And lat no small beist suffir skaith, na skornis Of greit beistis that bene of moir piscence; Do law elyk to aipis and vnicornis, And lat no bowgle, with his busteous hornis, The meik pluch ox oppress, for all his pryd, Bot in the ?ok go peciable him besyd.” Quhen this was said, with noyis and soun of joy, All kynd of beistis in to thair degre, At onis cryit lawd, “Viue le Roy!” And till his feit fell with humilite, And all thay maid him homege and fewte; And he did thame ressaif with princely laitis, Quhois noble yre is proceir prostratis. Syne crownit scho the Egle King of Fowlis, And as steill dertis scherpit scho his pennis, And bawd him be als just to awppis and owlis, As vnto pacokkis, papingais, or crennis, And mak a law for wycht fowlis and for wrennis; And lat no fowll of ravyne do efferay, Nor devoir birdis bot his awin pray. Than callit scho all flouris that grew on feild, Discirnyng all thair fassionis and effeiris; Vpone the awfull Thrissill scho beheld, And saw him kepit with a busche of speiris; Concedring him so able for the weiris, A radius croun of rubeis scho him gaif, And said, “In feild go furth, and fend the laif; And, sen thow art a king, thow be discreit; Herb without vertew thow hald nocht of sic pryce As herb of vertew and of odor sueit; And lat no nettill vyle, and full of vyce, Hir fallow to the gudly flour delyce; Nor latt no wyld weid, full of churlicheness, Compair hir till the lilleis nobilness. Nor hald non vdir flour in sic denty As the fresche Ross, of cullour reid and quhyt; For gife thow dois, hurt is thyne honesty, Conciddering that no flour is so perfyt, So full of vertew, plesans and delyt, So full of blisfull angeilik bewty, Imperiall birth, honour and dignite.” Than to the Ross scho turnyt hir visage, And said, “O lusty dochtir most benyng, Aboif the lilly, illustare of lynnage, Fro the stok ryell rysing fresche and ?ing, But ony spot or macull doing spring; Cum blowme of joy with jemis to be cround, For our the laif thy bewty is renownd.” A coistly croun, with clarefeid stonis brycht, This cumly quene did on hir heid incloiss, Quhill all the land illumynit of the licht; Quhairfoir me thocht all flouris did reioss, Crying attonis, “Haill, be thow richest Ross! Haill, hairbis empryce, haill, freschest quene of flouris, To the be glory and honour at all houris.” Thane all the birdis song with voce on hicht, Quhois mirthfull soun wes mervelus to heir; The mavyss song, “Haill, Roiss most riche and richt, That dois vp flureiss vndir Phebus speir; Haill, plant of ?owth, haill, princes dochtir deir, Haill, blosome breking out of the blud royall, Quhois pretius vertew is imperiall.” The merle scho sang, “Haill, Roiss of most delyt, Haill, of all flouris quene and souerane;” The lark scho song, “Haill, Roiss, both reid and quhyt, Most plesand flour, of michty cullouris twane;” The nychtingaill song, “Haill, naturis suffragene, In bewty, nurtour and every nobilness, In riche array, renown and gentilness.” The commoun voce vpraiss of birdis small, Apone this wyss, “O blissit be the hour That thow wes chosin to be our principall; Welcome to be our princes of honour, Our perle, our plesans and our paramour, Our peax, our play, our plane felicite, Chryst the conserf frome all aduersite.” Than all the birdis song with sic a schout, That I annone awoilk quhair that I lay, And with a braid I turnyt me about To se this court; bot all wer went away: Than vp I lenyt, halflingis in affrey, And thuss I wret, as ?e haif hard to forrow, Off lusty May vpone the nynt morrow.

[O SYNFULL MAN, THIR AR THE FOURTY DAYIS.] O synfull man, thir ar the fourty dayis That every man sulde wilfull pennence dre; Oure Lorde Jhesu, as haly writ sayis, Fastit him self oure exampill to be; Sen sic ane michty king and lorde as he, To fast and pray was so obedient, We synfull folk sulde be more deligent. I reid [the,] man, of thi transgressioun, With all thi hert, that thow be penitent; Thow schrive the clene, and mak confessioun, And se thairto [that] thow be deligent, With all thi synnes into thi mynde present, That every syn be the selfe be schawin, To thyne confessioun it ma be kend and knawin. Apon thi body gif thow hes ane wounde That caussis the gret panis for to feill, Thair is no leiche ma mak the haill and sounde, Quhill it be sene, and clengit every deill; Rycht sua thi schrift, bot it be schawin weill, Thow art nocht abill remissioun for to get, Wittandlie and thow [suld] ane syn for?et. Off tuenty woundis, and ane be left unhelit Quhat awalis the leiching of the laif? Rycht sua thi schrift, and thair be oucht concelit, It avalis nocht thi sely saule to saif; Nor ?it of God remissioun for to haif: Of syn gif thow wald have deliverance, Thow sulde it tell with all the circumstance. Sa that thi confessour be wyss and discreit, Than can the discharge of every doute and weir, And power hes of thy synnes compleit: Gif thow can nocht schaw furth thi synnes perqueir, And he be blinde, and can nocht at the speir, Thow ma rycht weill in thi mynde consydder That ane blynde man is led furth be ane uther. And sa I halde, that ?e ar baith begylde; He can nocht speir, nor thow can nocht him tell, Quhen, nor how, thi conscience thow hes fylde; Thairfor, I reid, that thow excuse thi sell, And rype thi mynde how every thing befell, The tyme, the place, and how, and in quhat wyis, So that thi confessioun ma thi synnes pryce. Awys the weill, or thou cum to the preist, Of all thi synnes, and namelie of the maist, That thai be reddy prentit in thi breist; Thow sulde nocht cum to schryfe the in [greit] haist, And syne sit doun abasit as ane beist: With humyll [hart] and sad contrytioun, Thow suld cum to [mak] thine confessioun. With thine awin mouth thi synnes thow suld tell; Bot sit and heir the preist hes nocht ado, Quha kennes thi synnes better na thi sell? Thairfor, I reid the, tak gude tent thairto; Thow knawis best quhair bindis the thi scho; Thairfor, be wys afor or thow thair cum, That thow schaw furth thi synnes all and sum. Quhair seldin compt is tane, and hes a hevy charge, And syne is rekless in his governance, And on his conscience he takis all to large, And on the end hes no rememberance, That man is abill to fall ane gret mischance: The synfull man that all the ?eir our settis, Fra Pasche to Pasche, rycht mony a thing for?ettis. I reid the, man, quhill thow art stark and young, With pith and strenth into thi ?eris grene, Quhill thow art abill baith in mynde and toung, Repent the, man, and kepe thi conscience clene; Till byde till age is mony perrell sene: Small merit is of synnes for to irke Quhen thow art ald, and ma na wrangis wyrke. POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO DUNBAR I. THE FREIRIS OF BERWIK.The attribution of this poem is questionable. As it befell, and happinnit in-to deid, Vpoun a rever, the quhilk is callit Tweid; At Tweidis mowth thair standis a nobill toun, Quhair mony lordis hes bene of grit renovne, Quhair mony a lady bene fair of face, And mony ane fresche lusty galland wass. In-to this toun, the quhilk is callit Berwik, Vpoun the sey thair standis nane it lyk, For it is wallit weill abowt with stane, And dowbill stankis castin mony ane; And syne the castell is so strang and wicht, With strait towris and turattis he on hicht; The wallis wrocht craftely withall; The portcules most subtelly to fall, Quhen that thame list to draw thame vpoun hicht; That it micht be of na maner of micht To win that houss be craft or subteltie. Quhairfoir it is maist gud allutirly, In-to my tyme quhair evir I haif bene, Moist fair, most gudly, most plesand to be sene; The tovne, the wall, the castell and the land, The he wallis vpoun the vpper hand, The grit croce kirk, and eik the Masone Dew, The Jacobene freiris of the quhyt hew, The Carmeleitis, and the monkis eik; The four ordouris wer nocht for to seik, Thay wer all in this toun dwelling. So appinnit in a Maij morning, That twa of the Jacobyne freiris, As thay wer wont and vsit mony ?eiris To pass amang thair brethir vpaland, Wer send of thame best practisit and cunnand, Freir Allane, and Freir Robert the vder; Thir silly Freiris with wyffis weill cowld gluder; Rycht wondir weill plesit thai all wyffis And tawld thame tailis of haly sanctis lyffis, Quhill on a tyme thay purposit to pass hame; Bot verry tyrit and wett wes Freir Allane, For he wes awld, and micht nocht wele travell, And als he had ane littill spyce of gravell. Freir Robert wes ?oung, and verry hett of blude, And be the way he bure both clothis and hude, And all thair geir, for he wes strong and wicht. Be that it drew neir towart the nicht, As thay wer cumand towart the tovne full neir; Freir Allane said than, “Gud bruder deir, It is to lait, I dreid the ?et be closit, And we ar tyrit, and verry evill disposit To luge owt of the toun, bot gif that we In sume gud houss this nycht mot herbryt be.” Swa wynnit thair ane woundir gude hostillar, Without the toun, in till a fair manar, And Symon Lawrear wes his name; Ane fair blyth wyf he had, of ony ane, Bot scho wes sumthing dynk and dengerous. The silly Freiris quhen thay come to the houss, With fair hailsing and bekking courteslye, To thame scho anschirit agane in hye; Freir Robert sperit eftir the gud man, And scho agane anschirit thame thane, “He went fra hame, God wait, on Weddinsday, In the cuntre for to seik corne and hay, And vthir thingis quhairof we haif neid.” Freir Robert said, “I pray grit God him speid Him haill and sound in-to his travell,” And hir desyrit the stowp to fill of aill, That we may drink, for I am wondir dry. With that the wyfe went furth richt schortly, And fillit the stowp, and brocht in breid and cheiss; Thay eit and drank, and satt at thair awin eiss. Freir Allane said to the gudwyf in hye, “Cum hiddir, deme, and sett ?ow doun me bye, And fill the cop agane anis to me;” Freir Robert said, “Full weill payit sall ?e be.” The Freiris wer blyth, and mirry tailis cowld tell, And even with that thay hard the prayer bell Off thair awin abbay, and than thay wer agast, Becauss thay knew the ?ettis wer closit fast, That thay on na wayiss micht gett entre. Than the gudwyfe thay prayit for cheritie To grant thame herbrye that ane nicht; Bot scho to thame gaif anschir with grit hicht, “The gudman is fra hame, as I ?ow tald, And God it wait, gif I durst be so bald To herbry Freiris in this houss with me, Quhat wald Symon say, ha, benedicite, Bot in his absence I abusit his place? Our deir Lady Mary keip fra sic cace, And keip me owt of perrell and of schame.” Than auld Freir Allane said, “Na, fair dame, For Godis saik, heir me quhat I sall say, In gud faith, we will both be deid or day; The way is evill, and I am tyrit and wett, Our ?ettis ar closit that we may nocht in gett, And to our abbay we can nocht win in; To causs ws perreiss but help ?e haif grit syn; Thairfoir of verry neid we mon byd still, And ws commit alhaill in-to ?our will.” The gudwyf lukit vnto the Freiris tway, And, at the last, to thame culd scho say, “?e byd nocht heir, be Him that ws all coft; Bot gif ?e list to lig vp in ?one loft, Quhilk is weill wrocht in-to the hallis end, ?e sall fynd stray, and clathis I sall ?ow send; Quhair, and ?e list, pass on baith in feir, For on no wayis will I repair haif heir.” Hir madin than scho send hir on befoir, And hir thay followit baith withowttin moir; Thay war full blyth, and did as scho thame kend, And vp thay went, in-to the hallis end, In till a loft wes maid for corne and hay; Scho maid thair bed, syne past doun but delay, Closit the trop and thay remanit still. In-to the loft thay wantit of thair will; Freir Allane lay doun as he best micht; Freir Robert said, “I hecht to walk this nicht, Quha wait perchance sum sport I ma espy?” Thus in the loft latt I thir Freiris ly, And of the gudwyf now I will speik mair. Scho wes richt blyth that thay wer closit thair, For scho had maid ane tryst that samyn nicht Freir Johine hir luvis supper for to dicht; And scho wald haif none vder cumpany, Becauss Freir Johine that nicht with hir sowld ly, Quha dwelland wes in-to that samyne toun, And ane Blak Freir he wes of grit renown. He govirnit alhaill the abbacy; Silwer and gold he had aboundantly; He had a prevy posterne of his awin, Quhair he micht ische, quhen that he list, vnknawin. Now thus in-to the toun I leif him still, Bydand his tyme; and turne agane I will To this fair wyfe, how scho the fyre cowld beit, And thristit on fatt caponis to the speit; And fatt cunyng[is] to fyre did scho lay, Syne bad the madin, in all the haist [scho] may, To flawme, and turne, and rost thame tenderly. And to hir chalmer so scho went in hy; Scho pullit hir cunt, and gaif hit buffettis tway Vpoun the cheikis, syne till it cowd scho say, “?e sowld be blyth and glaid at my requeist, Thir mvllis of ?ouris ar callit to ane feist.” Scho cleithis hir in a kirtill of fyne reid, Ane fair quhyt curch scho puttis vpoun hir heid; Hir kirtill wes of silk, and silwer fyne, Hir vthir garmentis as the reid gold did schyne; On every finger scho weiris ringis two; Scho was als prowd as ony papingo. The burde scho cuverit with clath of costly greyne, Hir napry aboif wes woundir weill besene. Than but scho went, to se gif ony come, Scho thocht full lang to meit hir lufe Freir Johine. Syne schortly did this Freir knok at the ?ett; His knok scho kend, and did so him in lett. Scho welcomit him in all hir best maneir; He thankit hir, and said, “My awin luve deir, Haif thair ane pair of bossis, gud and fyne, Thay hald ane gallone full of Gascone wyne; And als ane pair of pertrikis richt new slane, And eik ane creill full of breid of mane; This I haif brocht to ?ow, my awin luve deir, Thairfoir, I pray ?ow, be blyth, and mak gud cheir; Sen it is so that Semon is fra hame, I wilbe hamely now with ?ow, gud dame. Scho sayis, “?e ar full hertly welcome heir At ony tyme, quhen that ?e list appeir. With that scho smylit woundir lustely; He thristit hir hand agane richt prevely, Than in hett luve thay talkit vderis till. Thus at thair sport now will I leif thame still, And tell ?ow off thir silly Freiris two Wer lokit in the loft amang the stro: Freir Allane in the loft still can ly; Freir Robert had ane littill jelosy, For in his hairt he had ane persaving, And throw the burdis he maid with his botkin A littill hoill on sic a wyiss maid he, All that thay did thair doun he micht weill se, And every word he herd that thay did say. Quhen scho wes prowd, richt woundir fresche and gay, Scho callit him baith hert, lemmane and luve; Lord God, gif than his curage wes aboif, So prelat lyk sat he in to the chyre: Scho rownis than ane pistill in his eir; Thus sportand thame, and makand melody: And quhen scho saw the supper wes reddy, Scho gois belyfe and cuveris the burde annon, And syne the pair of bossis hes scho tone, And sett thame doun vpoun the burde hir by. And evin with that thay hard the gudman cry, And knokand at the ?ett he cryit fast: Quhen thay him hard then wer thay both agast: And als Freir Johine wes in a fellone fray, He stert vp fast, and wald haif bene away, Bot all for nocht, he micht no way win owt. The gudwyfe spak than, with a visage stowt, “?one is Symone that makis all this fray, That I micht tholit full weill had bene away; I sall him quyt, and I leif half a ?eir, That cummert hes ws thus in sic maneir, Becauss for him we may nocht byd togidder; I soir repent and wo is ?e come hidder, For we wer weill gif that ?e wer away.” “Quhat sall I do, allace?” the Freir can say, [“Into this case, Lord! how sall I me beir, For I am schent and Symon fynd me heir, I dreid me sair, and he cum in this innis, And fynd me heir, that I los bath my quhynnis.”] “Hyd ?ou,” scho said, “quhill he be brocht to rest, In-to ?one troich, I think it for the best; It lyis mekle and huge in all ?one nwke, It held a boll of meill quhen that we buke.” Than vndir it scho gart him creip in hy, And bad him lurk thair verry quyetly; Scho closit him, and syne went on hir way. “Quhat sall I do, allace?” the Freir can say. Syn to hir madin spedyly scho spak, “Go to the fyre, and the meitis fra it tak; Be bissy als, and slokkin out the fyre; Ga cloiss ?one burd, and tak away the chyre, And lok vp all in to ?one almery, Baith meit and drink, with wyne and aill put by; The mayne breid als thow hyd it with the wyne; That being done, thow sowp the houss clene syne, That na apperance of feist be heir sene, Bot sobirly our selffis dois sustene.” And syne, withowttin ony mair delay, Scho castis of haill hir fresch array; Than went scho to hir bed annone, And tholit him to knok his fill, Symone. Quhen he for knoking tyrit wes, and cryid, Abowt he went vnto the vdir syd, [Till ane windo wes at hir beddis heid, And cryit “Alesoun awalk for Goddis deid!”] And on Alesone fast cold he cry; And at the last scho anschirit crabitly, “Ach, quha be this that knawis sa weill my name? Go henss,” scho sayis, “for Symon is fra hame, And I will herbry no gaistis heir perfay; Thairfoir I pray ?ow to wend on ?our way, For at this tyme ?e may nocht lugit be.” Than Symone said, “Fair dame, ken ?e nocht me? I am your Symone and husband of this place.” “Ar ?e my spous Symone?” scho sayis, “allace, Be misknawlege I had almaist misgane, Quha wenit that ?e sa lait wald haif cum hame?” Scho stertis vp and gettis licht in hy, And oppinit than the ?et full haistely; Scho tuk fra him his geir at all devyiss, Syne welcomit him on maist hairtly wyiss. He bad the madin kindill on the fyre, Syne graith me meit, and tak ?e all thy hyre. The gudwyf said schortly, “?e may trow, Heir is no meit that ganand is for ?ow.” “How sa, fair deme, ga gait me cheiss and breid, Ga fill the stowp, hald me no mair in pleid, For I am verry tyrit, wett and cauld.” Than vp scho raiss, and durst nocht mair be bauld, Cuverit the burde, thairon sett meit in hy, Ane sowsit nolt fute, and scheipheid, haistely; And sum cauld meit scho brocht to him belyve, And fillit the stowp. The gudman than wes blyth; Than satt he doun, and swoir “be All hallow, I fair richt weill and I had ane gud fallow: Dame, eit with me, and drink, gif that ?e may.” Said the gudwyf, “Devill inche cun may I; It wer mair meit in to ?our bed to be, Than now to sit desyrand cumpany.” [The freiris twa, that in the loft can ly Thay hard him weill desyrand cumpany.] Freir Robert said, “Allace, gud bruder deir, I wald the gudman wist that we wer heir, Quha wait perchance sum bettir wald he fair; For sickerly my hairt will ay be sair Gif ?one scheipheid with Symon birneist be, Sa mekill gud cheir being in the almerie:” And with that word he gaif ane hoist anone. The gudman hard, and speirit, “Quha is ?one? [Methink that thair is men into ?on loft.” The gudwyf ansuerit with wourdis soft, “?on ar ?our awin Freyris brether tway.”] Symone said, “Tell me quhat Freiris be thay.” “?one is Freir Robert and silly Freir Allane, That all this day hes travellit with grit pane; Be thay come heir it wes so verry lait Curfur wes rung, and closit wes thair [?ait;] And in ?one loft I gaif thame harb[o]rye.” The gudman said, “Sa God haif pairt of me, Tha Freiris twa ar hairtly welcome hidder, Ga call thame doun, that we ma drink togidder.” The gudwyf said, “I reid ?ow latt thame be, Thay had levir sleip nor sit in cumpanye. [To drink and dot, it ganis nocht for thame.” “Let be, fair dame, thy wordis ar in vane, I will thame haif be Goddis dignite; Mak no delay, bot bring thame doun to me.”] The gudman said vnto the maid[in] thone, “Go, pray thame baith to cum till me annone.” And sone the trop the madin oppinit than, And bad thame baith cum doun to the gudman. Freir Robert said, “Now be sweit Sanct Jame, The gudman is verry velcome hame, And for his weilfair dalie do we pray; We sall annone cum doun to him, ?e say.” Than with that word thay start vp baith attone, And doun the trop delyverly thay come, Halsit Symone als sone as thay him se; And he agane thame welcomit hairtfullie, And said, “Cum heir, myne awin bredir deir, And sett ?ow doun sone besyd me heir, For I am now allone, as ?e may se; Thairfoir sitt doun, and beir me cumpanye, And tak ?ow pairt of sic gud as we haif.” Freir Allane said, “Schir, I pray God ?ow saif, For heir is now annwch of Godis gud.” Than Symon anschirit, “Now, be the Rud, ?it wald I gif ane croun of gold for me, For sum gud meit and drink amangis ws thre.” Freir Robert said, “Quhat drinkis wald ?e craif, Or quhat meitis desyre ?e for to haif? For I haif mony sindry practikis seir, Beyond the sey in Pareiss did I leir, That I wald preve glaidly for ?our saik, And for ?our demys that harbry cowd ws maik. I tak on hand, and ?e will counsale keip, That I sall gar ?ow se, or ever I sleip, Of the best meit that is in this cuntre; Off Gascone wyne, gif ony in it be; Or, be thair ony within ane hundreth myle, It salbe heir within a bony quhyle.” The gudman had grit mervell of this taill, And said, “My hairt [will] neir be haill Bot gif ?e preve that practik or ?e pairte, [Be quhat kin science, nigromansy, or art.” Freir Robert said, “Of this ?e haue no dreid, For I can do fer mair, and thair be neid.” Than Symon said, “Freir Robert, I ?ou pray, For my saik that science ?e wald assay,] To mak ane sport.” And than the Freir [vprais,] He tuk his buk and to the flure he gais; He turnis it our, and reidis it a littill space, And to the eist direct he turnis his face, [And maid ane croce, and than the freyr cuth lout] Syne to the west he turnit [him ewin about,] [Than in the north he turnit and lowtit down] And tuk his buk and red ane orisoun; And ay his eyne wer on the almery, And on the troch quhair that Freir Johine did ly. Than sat he doun, and kest abak his hude, He granit, and he glowrit, as he wer woid; And quhylis still he satt in studeing, And vthir quhylis vpoun his buk reding; And [quhylis] with baith his handis he wald clap, And vthir quhylis wald he glour and gaip; Syne in the sowth he turnit him abowt Weill thryiss, and mair than lawly cowd he lowt, Quhen that he come neir the almery. Thairat our dame had woundir grit invy, For in her hairt scho had ane persaving That he had knawin all hir govirning. Scho saw him gif the almery sic a straik, Vnto hir self scho said, “Full weill I wait I am bot schent, he knawis full weill my thocht; Quhat sall I do? Allace, that I wes wrocht; Get Symon wit, it wilbe deir doing.” Be that the Freir had left his studeing, And on his feit he startis vp full sture, And come agane, and seyit all his cure. Now is it done, and ?e sall haif playntie Of breid and wyne, the best in this cuntre; Thairfoir, fair dame, get vp deliverlie, And ga belyfe vnto ?one almerie, And oppin it; and se ?e bring ws syne Ane pair of boissis full of Gascone wyne, Thay had ane galloun and mair, that wait I weill; And bring ws als the mayne breid in a creill; Ane pair of cunyngis, fat and het pypand; The caponis als ?e sall ws bring fra hand; Twa pair of pertrikis, I wait thair is no ma; And eik of pluveris se that ?e bring ws twa. The gudwyf wist it wes no variance; Scho knew the Freir had sene hir govirnance; Scho saw it wes no bute for to deny; With that scho went vnto the almery, And oppinnit it, and than scho fand thair All that the Freir had spokin of befoir. Scho stert abak, as scho wer in a fray, And sanyt hir, and smyland cowd scho say, “Ha, banedicitie, quhat may this bene? Quha evir afoir hes sic a fairly sene? Sa grit a mervell as now hes apnit heir, Quhat sall I say? He is ane haly Freir, He said full swth of all that he did say.” Scho brocht all furth, and on the burd cowd lay Baith breid and wyne, and vthir thingis moir, Cunyngis and caponis, as ?e haif hard befoir; Pertrikis and pluveris befoir thame hes scho brocht. The Freir knew weill and saw thair wantit nocht, Bot all wes furth brocht, evin at his devyiss. And Symone saw it appinnit on this wyiss, He had grit wondir, and sweris be the mone That Freir Robert weill his dett had done; He may be callit ane man of grit science, Sa suddanly maid all this purviance Hes brocht ws heir throw his grit subteltie, And throw his knawlege in filosophie: In ane gud tyme it wes quhen he come hidder; Now fill the cop that we ma drink togidder, And mak gud cheir eftir this langsum day, For I haif riddin ane woundir wilsome way. Now God be lovit, heir is suffisance Vnto ws all throw ?our gud govirnance: And than annone thay drank evin round abowt Of Gascone wyne; the Freiris playit cop owt. Thay sportit thame, and makis mirry cheir With sangis lowd, baith Symone and the Freir; And on this wyiss the lang nicht thay ourdraif; No thing thay want that thay desyrd to haif. Than Symon said to the gudwyf in hy, “Cum heir, fair dame, and sett ?ow doun me by, And tak pairte of sic gud as we haif heir, And hairtly, I ?ow pray, to thank this Freir Off his bening grit besines and cure, That he hes done to ws vpoun this flure, And brocht ws meit and drink haboundantlie, Quhairfoir of richt we aucht mirry to be.” Bot all thair sport, quhen thay wer maist at eiss, Vnto our deme it wes bot littill pleiss, For vther thing thair wes in to hir thocht; Scho wes so red, hir hairt wes ay on flocht, That throw the Freir scho sowld discoverit be, To him scho lukit oft tymes effeiritlie, And ay disparit in hart was scho, That he had witt of all hir purveance to. Thus satt scho still, and wist no vdir wane; Quhat evir thay say, scho lute him all alane, Bot scho drank with thame in-to cumpany With fen?eit cheir, and hert full wo and hevy. Bot thay wer blyth annwche, God watt, and sang, For ay the wyne was rakand thame amang, Quhill at the last thay woix richt blyth ilk one. Than Symone said vnto the Freir annone, “I mervell mikill how that this may be, In till schort tyme that ?e sa suddanlye Hes brocht to ws sa mony denteis deir.” Thairof haif ?e no mervell,” quod the Freir, “I haif ane pege full prevy of my awin Quhen evir I list will cum to me vnknawin, And bring to me sic thing as I will haif; Quhat evir I list it neidis me nocht to craif. Thairfoir be blyth, and tak in pacience, And trest ?e weill I sall do diligence; Gif that ?e list, or thinkis to haif moir, It salbe had and I sall stand thairfoir, Incontinent that samyn sall ?e se; Bot I protest that ?e keip it previe, Latt no man wit that I can do sic thing.” Than Symone swoir, and said, “Be hevynnis king, It salbe kepit prevy as for me; Bot, bruder deir, ?our schirwand wald I se, Gif it ?ow pleiss, that we may drynk togidder, For I wait nocht gif ?e ma ay cum hidder, Quhen that we want our neidis sic as this.” The Freir said, “Nay, so mot I haif hevynis bliss, ?ow to haif the sicht of my schirwand It can nocht be; ?e sall weill vndirstand, That ?e may se him graithly in his awin kynd, Bot ?e annone sowld go owt of your mynd, He is so fowll and vgly for to se; I dar nocht awnter for to tak on me, To bring him hidder heir in-to our sicht, And namely now so lait in to the nicht; Bot gif it wer on sic a maner wyiss Him to translait or ellis dissagyiss Fra his awin kynd in-to ane vder stait.” Than Symone said, “I mak no moir debait, As pleisis ?ow so lyk is it to me, As evir ?e list, bot fane wald I him se.” [Freyr Robert said, “Sen that ?our will is so, Tell onto me withouttin wourdis mo,] In till quhat kynd sall I him gar appeir?” Than Symone said, “In liknes of a Freir, In quhyt cullour, richt as ?our self it war, For quhyt cullour will na body deir,” [And ewill spreitts quhyte colour ay will fle.] Freir Robert said that swa it cowld nocht be, For sic caussis as he may weill foirse, That he compeir in to our habeit quhyt, Vntill I ordour it wer a grit dispyte, That ony sic vnworthy wicht as he In till our habeit men sowld behald or se. Bot sen it pleissis ?ow that ar heir, ?e sall him se in liknes of a Frier; In habeit blak it was his kynd to weir, [Into sic wys that he sall no man deir.] Gif ?e so do, and rewll ?ow at all wyiss To hald ?ow cloiss and still at my devyiss, Quhat evir it be ?e owdir se or heir, ?e speik no word, nor mak no kynd of steir, Bot hald ?ow cloiss, quhill I haif done my cure. Than said he, “Semon, ?e mone be on the flure, Neirhand besyd with staff in to your hand; Haif ?e no dreid, I sall ?ow ay warrand.” Than Symon said, “I assent that it be swa;” And vp he start, and gat a libberla In-to his hand, and on the flure he stert, Sumthing effrayit, thocht stalwart was his hart. Than to the Freir said Symone verry sone, “Now tell me, maister, quhat ?e will haif done.” “No thing,” he said, “bot hald ?ow cloiss and still; Quhat evir I do tak ?e gud tent thairtill, And neir the dur ?e hyd ?ow prevely, And quhen I bid ?ow stryk, strek hardely, In to the nek se that ?e hit him richt.” “That sall I warrand,” quod he, “with all my micht.” Thuss on the flure I leif him standand still, Bydand his tyme; and turne agane I will, How that the Freir did take his buke in hy, And [turnit] our the levis full besely, Ane full lang space, and quhen he had done swa, Towart the troch withowttin wordis ma He gois belyfe, and on this wyiss sayis he, “Ha, how, Hurlybass, now I coniure the, That thow vpryss and sone to me appeir, In habeit blak in liknes of a freir; Owt of this troch, quhair that thow dois ly, Thow rax the sone, and mak no dyn nor cry; Thow tumbill our the troch that we may se, And vnto ws thow schaw the oppinlie; And in this place se that thow no man greif, Bot draw thy handis boith in to thy sleif, And pull thy cowll doun owttour thy face; Thow may thank God that thow gettis sic a grace; Thairfoir thow turss the to thyne awin ressett, Se this be done and mak no moir debait; In thy depairting se thow mak no deray Vnto no wicht, bot frely pass thy way; And in this place se that thow cum no moir, Bot I command the, or ellis the charge befoir; And our the stair se that thow ga gud speid; Gif thow dois nocht on thy awin perrell beid.” With that the Freir, that vnder the troch lay, Raxit him sone, bot he wes in a fray, And vp he raiss, and wist na bettir wayn, Bot of the troch he tumlit our the stane; Syne fra the samyn quhairin he thocht him lang, Vnto the dur he preisit him to gang, With hevy cheir and drery countenance, For nevir befoir him hapnit sic a chance. And quhen Freir Robert saw him gangand by, Vnto the Gudman full lowdly cowd he cry, Stryk, stryk herdely, for now is tyme to the. With that Symone a felloun flap lait fle, With his burdoun he hit him on the nek; He wes sa ferce he fell owttour the sek, And brak his heid vpoun ane mustard stane. Be this Freir Johine attour the stair is gane In sic wyiss, that mist he hes the trap, And in ane myr he fell, sic wes his hap, Wes fourty futis of breid vndir the stair; ?eit gat he vp with clething nothing fair; Full drerelie vpoun his feit he stude, And throw the myre full smertly than he ?ude, And our the wall he clam richt haistely, Quhilk round abowt wes laid with stanis dry: Off his eschaping in hairt he wes full fane, I trow he salbe laith to cum agane. With that Freir Robert stert abak and saw Quhair the Gudman lay sa woundir law Vpoun the flure, and bleidand wes his heid; He stert to him, and went he had bene deid, And clawcht him vp withowttin wordis moir, And to the dur delyverly him bure; And fra the wind wes blawin twyiss in his face, Than he ourcome within a lytill space; And than Freir Robert franyt at him fast, Quhat ailit him to be so soir agast. He said, “?one Freir hes maid me thus gait say.” “Lat be,” quod he, “the werst is all away; Mak mirry, man, and se ?e mvrne na mair, ?e haif him strikin quyt owttour the stair. I saw him slip, gif I the suth can tell, Doun our the stair, in till a myr he fell; Bot lat him go, he wes a graceles gaist, And boun ?ow to ?our bed, for it is best.” Thus Symonis heid vpoun the stane wes brokin, And our the stair the Freir in myre hes loppin, And tap our taill he fyld wes woundir ill; And Alesone on na wayiss gat hir will. This is the story that hapnit of that Freir, No moir thair is, bot Chryst ws help most deir. Finis. II. [DOUN BY ANE REVER AS I RED.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Doun by ane rever as I red, Outthrow a forrest that wes fair, Thynkand how that this warld wes maid; Sa suddanly away we fair, That kingis and lordis sall haif no mair, Fra tyme that thay be bund on beir; Thus spak a fowll, I ?ow declair, “Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” I marvellit quhat that bird sowld be That wes so fair, with fedderis gent; Scho bownid hir nocht to fle fra me, But satt, and tald me hir intent,— “Off thy misdeidis thow the repent, And of thy synnys confess the cleir, For Deid he hes his bow ay bent; Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “Fra he begyn to schute his schot, Thow wat nocht quhen that it will licht; He spairis the nocht, in schip, nor bot, In coive, nor craig, na castell wicht; Bot as the sone that schynis bricht, Owtthrwch the glass that is so cleir, To lenth thy lyfe thow hes no micht; Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “Gif ony man his lyfe micht lenth, I wat it had bene Salamone; Of all wisdome he had the strenth, He knew the vertew of erb and stone; He cowld nocht for him self dispone Attour his dait, to leif a ?eir; Ane wysar wicht wes never none; Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “Quhairto sowld I thir sampillis say? Thow hes sene mo than I can tell, Off lordis in to this land perfay, Sum wyse, sum wicht, sum forss, sum fell, Thay dowttit nowthir hevin nor hell, Thay wer so wicht, withowttin weir; Now with thair sawle we will nocht mell; Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “And gif thow beis ane marchand man, And wynnis thy living be the see, Spend pairt of the gude [that] thow wan, And keip the ay with honestie; Fra thow be gane, I tak on me, Thy wyfe will haif ane vthir feir, Thy dalie sample thow may se; Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “Or gif thow hes a benefice, Preiss nevir to hurde the kirkis gude; Do almouss deidis to peure alwayss, In to this warld; to win the rude Thow mon be bwreit in thy hude, Thy windene scheit is nocht in weir, Thy airis ar of eild to dwid; Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “I say this be a preist of pryd, That wes full wanton of his will; Gold and siluer lay him besyd, The fremmit thairof thair baggis can fill; All that thay prayit for him wes ill, For now thay drink and makis gud cheir; Wyismen said, he did nane skill: Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “And of this preist I will speik mair, That had sa mekle of warldis wrack, Off all his freindis, less and mair He wald nocht mend thame worth ane plack; Quhill Deid he hint him be the back, That he micht nowdir stand nor steir, And lute him nocht his testment mack: Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” “Sen for no wisdome, nor no strenth, Nor for no richess in this erd, That ony man his lyf may lenth, Naythir for freyndschip agane wanewerd; I tak on hand fra thow be berd, Thy sectouris spendis thy gudis cleir: Thow may say that a fowle the lerd: Do for thy self quhill thow art heir.” III. [FANE WALD I LUVE, BOT QUHAIR ABOWT?]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Fane wald I luve, bot quhair abowt? Thair is so mony luvaris thairowt, That thair is left no place to me; Quhairof I hovit now in dowt, Gif I sowld luve, or lat it be. Sa mony ar thair ladeis treitis With triumphand amowres balleitis, And dois thair bewteis pryiss so he, That I find nocht bot daft consaitis To say of luve; bot lat it be. Sum thinkis his lady lustiest, Sum haldis his lady for the best, Sum sayis his luve is A per se; Bot sum, forswth, ar so opprest With luve, wer bettir lat it be. Sum for his ladyis luve lyis seik, Suppois scho comptis it nocht a leik; And sum drowpis down as he wold die; Sum strykis down a threid bair cheik For luve, war bettir lat it be. Sum luvis lang and lyis behind, Sum luvis and freindschip can nocht fynd, Sum festnit is, and ma nocht fle; Sum led is lyk the belly blynd With luve, wer bettir lat it be. Thocht luve be grene in gud curage, And be difficill till asswage, The end of it is miserie: Misgovernit ?owth makis gowsty age; Forbeir ?e nocht, and lat it be. Bot quha perfytly wald imprent, Sowld fynd his luve moist permanent, Luve God, thy prince, and freind, all thre; Treit weill thy self, and stand content, And latt all vthir luvaris be. IV. FAINE WALD I, WITH ALL DILIGENCE.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Faine wald I, with all diligence, Ane sang mak, plesand of sentence, To everie mannis appetyte; Bot thairin fail?es my science: Thus wait I nocht quhairof to wryte. For, thocht sevin ?eir I war avysit, And with my wittis all devysit, Ane singulare thing to put in dyte; It suld with sum men be dispysit: Thus wait I nocht quhairof to wryte. And thocht I say in generale, Sum sall it tak in speciale; And of sum folk I suld have wyte, Quham I did never offend nor sall: Thus wait I nocht quhairof to wryte. Wryte I of liberalitie, Of gentrice, or nobilitie, Than will thay say I flatter quyte, Sa few ar of that facultie; Thus wait I nocht quhairof to wryte. And, gif I wryte of wretchitnes, Than is it war than ever it wes; For thay will say that I bakbyte; So thik that surname dois incres; Thus wait I nocht quhairof to wryte. Wryte I nocht eftir all mennis mynd, Suppois that pairt be evil inclynd, The making is nocht wourthe ane myte; Is nane so hable, heir to Ynde, That eftir all mennis will can wryte. Grit danger is in the endyting; Gif lytil rewarde be in wryting, Bettir war leif my paper quhyte, And [tak] me to vthir delyting: Thus wait I nocht quhairof to wryte. V. [GIF ?E WALD LUFE AND LUVIT BE.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Gif ?e wald lufe and luvit be, In mynd keip weill thir thingis thre, And sadly in thy breist imprent; Be secreit, trew, and pacient. For he that pacience can nocht leir, He sall displesance haif, perqueir, Thocht he had all this warldis rent; Be secreit, trew, and pacient. For quha that secreit can nocht be, Him all gud falloschip sall fle, And credence nane sall him be lent; Be secreit, trew, and pacient. And he that is of hairt vntrew, Fra he be kend, fair weill, adew. Fy on him, fy! his fame is went; Be secreit, trew, and pacient. Thus he that wantis ane of thir thre, Ane luvar glaid may neuir be, Bot ay in sum thing discontent; Be secreit, trew, and pacient. Nocht with thy toung thy self discure The thingis that thow hes of nature; For, giff thow dois, thow suld repent; Be secreit, trew, and pacient. Finis. VI. ANE LITTILL INTERLUD OF THE DROICHIS PART OF THE [PLAY].The attribution of this poem is questionable. Hiry, hary, hubbilschow! Se ?e not quha is cum now, Bot ?it wait I nevir how, With the quhirle wind? A sargeand out of Sowdoun land, A gyane strang for to stand, That with the strenth of my hand Beiris may bind. Bot ?it I trow that I vary, I am bot ane Blynd Hary, That lang hes bene with the fary Farlyis to fynd; And ?it gif this be not I, I wait it is the spreit of Gy, Or ellis fle be the sky, And lycht as the lynd. [The God of most magnificence Conserf this fair presens, And saif this amyable audiens Grete of renoune.

That generit am of gyanis kynd, Fra the strong Hercules be strynd, Off all the Occident and Ynd, My elderis woir the croun. My foir grandschir, hecht Fyn Mackcowll, That dang the Devill and gart him ?owll, The skyis raind quhen he wald [scowle] He trublit all the air: He gat my gudschir Gog Magog; He, quhen he dansit, the warld wald schog; Ten thowsand ellis ?eid in his frog Off Heland plaidis and mair. And ?it he wes of tendir ?owth; Bot eftir he grew mekle at fowth, Ellevin myle wyd mett was his mowth, His teith wes ten myle squair. He wald vpoun his tais vp stand, And tak the starnis doun with his hand, And sett thame in a gold garland Aboif his wyvis hair. He had a wyf was mekle of clift, Hir heid wan heichar nor the lift; The hevin reirdit quhen scho wald rift; The lass was na thing sklendir: Scho spatt Lochlomound with hir lippis; Thundir and fyreflawcht flaw fra hir hippis; Quhen scho was crabbit the sone thold clippis; The Feynd durst nocht offend hir. For cawld scho tuke the fevir cartane, For all the claith in France and Bartane, Wald not be to hir leg a gartane, Thocht scho was ?oung and tendir; Vpoun a nicht heir in the north, Scho tuke the gravall and staild Craig Gorth, And pischit the grit watter of Forth, Sic tyd ran eftir hend hir. ?it ane thing writtin of hir I fynd, In Yrland quhen scho blew behind, At Norway coist scho raisit the wynd, And grit schippis drownit thair. Scho fischit all the Span?ie seyis, With hir sark lap betuix hir theyis; Thre dayis saling betuix hir kneyis It was estemid and mair. The hingand brayis on adir syde Scho powtterit with hir lymmis wyde; Lassis micht leir at hir to stryde, Wald ga to luvaris lair. Scho markit to the land with mirth; Scho pischit fyve quhailis in the Firth, That croppin war in hir geig for girth, Walterand amang the wair. My fader, mekle Gow M?Morne, Owt of his moderis wame was schorne; For littilnes scho was forlorne, Siche ane kemp to beir: Or he of aige was ?eiris thre, He wald step over the occiane sie; The mone sprang nevir abone his kne, The hevins had of him feir. Ane thowsand ?eir is past fra mynd, Sen I was generid of his kynd, Far furth in the desertis of Ynd, Amang lyoun and beir: Worthie King Arthour and Gawane, And mony a bawld berne of Bartane, Ar deid and in the weiris ar slane, Sen I cowld weild a speir. Sophie and the Sowdoun strang, With weiris that hes lestit lang, Owt of thair boundis hes maid me gang, And turne to Turky tyte. The King of Francis grit army Hes brocht in derth in Lumbardy, That in the cuntre he and I Can nocht dwell baith perfyte.

In all oure gardyn growis thare na flouris, Herbe nor tree that frute hes borne this ?ere, The levys are doun schakyn with the schouris, The fynkle fadit in oure grene herbere; The birdis that bene wount to syngen here, In all this May vnese has songin thrise; And all of Dangere is our gardenere; And Gentrise is put quite out of seruice. Quhat that I mene be this I dar noght speke, For I na dare, my hert it is so sare, Na neuer sall I me revenge na wreke, Bot on myself, althogh I suld forfare; Saufand beaute I can prise na mare Of hyr, that was wont to be gudeliest; And suth it is, and sene in all our quhare, No erdly thing bot for a tyme may lest. Sen in this warld thare is no sekernes, Bot pas mon all, and end mon every thing, I tak my leve at all vnstedfastnes. VIII. [JERUSALEM REIOSS FOR JOY.]The attribution of this poem is questionable.

The regeand tirrant that in the rang, Herod, is exilit and his ofspring The land of Juda, that josit wrang; And rissin is now thy richtouss King. So he, so mychtie is and ding, Quhen men his gloriuss name dois nem, Hevin, erd, and hell makis inclynyng: Illumynare Jerusalem! His cummyng knew all element; The air be sterne did him persaife; The watter, quhen dry he on it went; The erd, that trymlit all and raife; The sone, quhen he no lichtis gaif; The croce, quhen it wes done contem; The stanis, quhen thay in pecis claif: Illumynare Jerusalem! The deid him knew that raiss vpricht, Quhilk lang tyme had the erd lyne vndir; Crukit, and blynd declarit his micht, That helit of thame so mony hundir; Nature him knew, and had grit wundir, Quhen he of wirgyn wes born but wem; Hell, quhen thair ?ettis wer brokin asundir Illumynare Jerusalem!

Abone the radius hevin etheriall, The court of sterris, the courss of sone and mone, The potent Prince of joy imperiall, The he surmonting Empriour abone, Is cummyn fra his mychtie Faderis trone In erd, with ane inestimable licht, And is, of angellis with a sweit intone, Borne of the most chest Virgyn Mary bricht. Quho euir in erd hard so blyth a story, Or tithing of sa grit felicite, As how the garthe of all grace and glory For luve and mercy hes tane humanite; Makar of angellis, man, erd, hevin, and se, And to ourcum our fo, and put to flicht, Is cumin a bab, full of benignite, Borne of the most chest Virgyn Mary bricht. The souerane Sen?our of all celsitude, That sittis abone the ordour cherubin, Quhilk all thing creat, and all thing dois includ, That neuir sall end, na neuir moir did begin, But quhome is nocht, fra quhome no tyme dois rin, With quhome all gud is, with quhome is euery wicht, Is with his woundis cum for to wesche our syn; Borne of the most chest Virgyn Mary bricht. Quhairfoir sing all with confort and glaidnes, And cast away all cair and cuvatice; Devoyd all wo, and leif in merines; Exerce vertew, and banyss euery vice; Dispyss fortun, richt rynis on synk and sise; And, in the honour of his blisfull mycht, All welcum we the Prince of Paradice, Borne of the most chest Virgyn Mary bricht.

Brycht sterne at morrow that dois the nycht hyn chase, Of luvis lychtsum lyfe and gyd, Lat no dirk clud absent fro ws thy face, Nor lat no sable frome ws thy bewty hyd, That hes no confort quhair that we go or ryd, Bot to behald the beme of thi brychtness; Baneiss all baill, and into bliss abyd; Dewoyd langour, and leif in lustiness. Art thow plesand, lusty, ?oing and fair; Full of all vertew and gud conditioun, Rycht nobill of blud, rycht wyiss and debonair, Honorable, gentill, and faythfull of renoun, Liberall, lufsum, and lusty of persoun, Quhy suld thow than lat sadness the oppress? In hairt be blytht and lay all dolour doun; Dewoyd langour, and leif in lustiness.
