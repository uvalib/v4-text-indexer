      <field name="fulltext">ADDRESS to THOMAS PENNANT, Esq. On the AUTHOR's being apprized of his Intention to make a Visit into CORNWALL. 1787. Pennant! to thee the tributary Muse Devotes a grateful Offering; proud to hail Thy Footsteps to her native Downs, though wild They whistle to the Spirit of the Winds, Like the dark Hebride Islands! Yet to thee, Favourite of Nature, the drear Waste displays No unprolific Aspect, whilst thine Eye Pierces with keen Acumen its deep Vein Of mineral Wealth, from ancient Days the Boast Of Cornwall's Sons! Yet to thine ardent Gaze, (If few our tufted Vales, where Zephyr sports On aromatic Wing) our Cliffs, high-pil'd In rugged Grandeur, on the whitening Surge Project the Gloom romantic, and abrupt From shiver'd Rocks and fretted Caverns breathe The sacred Horror that delights and chills! Yet many a curious Monument shall strike Thy antiquarian Mind, as fond to mark Each Relic of the vanish'd Shades, that cloath'd In Druid Ages the majestic Hill Of hoar Karnbre—as sedulous to trace It's Cromlehs and it's glimmering Shrine, or muse Upon the Ruins of its mossy Fane! Yet, many a Fortress (whether Roman Hosts, Or Saxon or the barbarous Dane uprear'd The embattled Turrets) shall attract thy Sight, Pale-gleaming thro' the Ivy-veil of Years! Yet, shall the Castle's massy Fragments guide To other Times thy penetrating Thought! Not that our Prospects are one cheerless Blank Unbroken, save where the bold Hand sublime Of rough Magnificence hath interpos'd The random Scenery: Witness, rising round In many a gentle Swell, the beauteous Hills That overbrow the Tamar—here distinct With Wood or reddening Grain or Pasturage—there Soft-clustering; till the Scene far off, retires From the charm'd Eye, and bids its vivid Hues Dissolve into a mellower Light, to meet The distant Purple, and in Shadow gain Heaven's purer Azure; sudden when the Wave Of long-lost Tamar sparkles to the Day, And seems by sweet Illusion to restore The fleeting Landscape!—Nor shalt thou despise The Richness of the vermeil Meads, that stretch'd Beneath Restormal's shaggy Ramparts, glow Full oft in gay Disclosure, or, embrown'd Amid luxuriant Foliage, slowly wind Into the secret Grove! Nor shalt thou slight Lanhydrock's verdant yet dismantled Bowers, Seat of Baronial Dignity, what Time Each helmed Hero bade his galleried Hall Echo to minstrel Harps! Still scatter'd there The Traces of heraldic Honors lead The melancholy Ponderer to the Days, When, towering, the rude-sculptur'd Gateway crown'd Yon solitary Lawn.—Nor wilt thou scorn The Fal's wide Current, where its woody Skreen O'erhangs the Wave, and, sweeping round the Crag's Bare Eminence, within the hollow Dell Slopes swift away, then quick protruded flings It's checquer'd Umbrage o'er the gliding Sail! And lo! illustrious Traveller, to our Downs Old Cornwall's Genius, with a raptur'd Glance, From grey Dunheved's necromantic Walls Kens thy Approach; and triumphs in the Hope Of high Distinction blazoning fair his Name, Amid the Records of thy deathless Page! SONNETS. SONNET the FIRST. To Laura. Written 1782. Survey, my Laura, yonder Rose, Its central Folds so sickly-pale; While round its outward Leaves disclose A lively Crimson to the Gale! Yet as the secret Canker-Worm Preys inly on its fainting Heart; From the cold Floweret's fallen Form Shall all that Glow of Color part! Ah! on thy Lover turn thine Eyes— The blooming Cheek may Laura see! Yet know this pining Bosom dies— And read the Rose's Fate in me! SONNET the SECOND. On being prevented, by a sudden Shower, from meeting Laura. Written 1782. Lo yonder Clouds in Envy lower, And dark'ning, shade the golden Hour In which, fond Hope with eager Eyes View'd Sun-bright Streams, and azure Skies; And sweet as Hebe's self portray'd, To bless the Scene, a blooming Maid! But soon the Visions disappear To airy Hope and Fancy dear! And see how little can destroy The Prospect vainly form'd for Joy; When ah! the Gloom that frowns away In wide Expanse the Orb of Day, Can veil, my Laura, from the View Thy fairer Orb of Beauty too! SONNET the THIRD. To his Wife. Written 1784. For thee, whose Love I value more than Life, Whose Charms the Balm of Heart-felt Bliss inspire— For thee I reassume my humble Lyre, Here—in this Shade, far distant from the Strife Of Scenes, where Fashion's pamper'd Votaries, rife In Dissipation's Revel, quench thy Fire O Muse! and blast the hallow'd Name of Wife 'Mid the dark Orgies of impure Desire— For thee, tho' ne'er my unambitious Strain May soothe the unfeeling World, I yet awhile Tune the rude Shell! and haply, not in vain, If (sweet Reward of every anxious Toil) My simple Song have still the Power to gain From Laura, but a fond approving Smile! SONNET the FOURTH. To the same. Written 1784. Amid this The Pleasure Ground of Powderham. Scene of varied Beauty plac'd, Where Nature's wild Simplicity, refin'd To Prospects that might charm ev'n Mason's Mind, Veils the fair Art, which lives in Courtenay's Taste; Let us, my Laura, no vain Wishes waste; But to the humbler Lot of Life resign'd Be ours, when Evening's pensive Shadows haste O'er the dark Trees and paler Lawn, to bind Contentment's modest Wreath around the Brows Of wedded Love, that sighing, oft renews The Memory of its fondly-storied Vows; Or smiling on the Day o'erpast, reviews Each Joy the Wife—the Mother can impart, To rivet, in Esteem, the Husband's Heart! SONNET the FIFTH. Written at Mamhead, beneath an Evergreen Oak—May, 1785. Here, Laura, since our wearied Feet have stray'd From the proud Obelisk that fronts the Scene Of many a tufted Hill, whose bolder Green The sweet Perspective blends in mellow Shade; While, sparkling thro' the stately Fir-trees, play'd The burnish'd Hamlets of the Vales between, And while the misty Bosom of the Glade Seem'd opening to the azure Sea serene— Here, Laura, let us rest our roving Eyes, And near this ever-verdant Oak repose; For lo, unharmoniz'd yon' Prospect lies, And dim-discovered Views the Landscape close; Yet clearer Beauties on the Lawn arise, And, in full Pride, the shadowy Foliage flows! SONNET the SIXTH. Written at the Belvidere—Powderham, May, 1785. As Morn's grey Mist, with Skirts of Rainbow Dyes, Rolls off, yon' opening River points my Sight (Its Wave amid the Hills one Line of Light) To where the antique Cathedral Turrets rise! And there, the rich Varieties surprize Of Landscape, stretching wide round Halldown's Height That seems, in scenic Pomp, to reach the Skies, Each Object, thro' contrasted Shadow, bright! And here, beyond these dark'ning Firs, that close Where slopes the castled Park's smooth Turf away, The dancing Billow to the Sun-beam glows; Whilst Harmony, her Magic to display, Soft o'er the blending Whole her Coloring throws, Yet leaves the threefold Scene distinct as Day! SONNET the SEVENTH. [O Circle, whether erst the Lightning's Lance] O Circle, whether erst the Lightning's Lance With its keen Azure shot thy wavy Way; Or—such the Tales of Village-Maidens say— The merry Fayes (what Time their Troops advance To thread the fleeting Mazes of the Dance, While bends dim Iris in the Lunar Ray) Form'd, as they tripp'd with many a twinkling Glance, Thy Ring, to speak their Revels to the Day; Still fancying, lovely Circle, that I trace Amid the Features of thy fading Dyes, The little Footsteps of the Fairy Race— Still, 'round the springing Verdure, shall arise In soft Relief, thy gently-curving Grace— Too trivial but for fond poetic Eyes! SONNET the EIGHTH. [How sweet—what Time the quick-rekindling Day] How sweet—what Time the quick-rekindling Day His orient Colors on my Dove-Cot streams,— Whose Gilding blushes in the vivid Ray, And o'er my Window flings reflected Beams; How sweet to listen to thy cooing Note, While slumbers softly leave the unsealed Eye, And on my Pillow lights the placid Thought To bid the hovering Dream of Morning fly! Yes, gentle Dove! may still thy plaintive Tone Be the first rural Sound to meet my Ear! And still this Breast such simple Pleasures own That, as a Lesson, I may love to hear— And picture, with no Gall to give Offence, Wafted on every Note, thy Innocence! SONNET the NINTH. [Tho' the group'd Trees that boast a wilder Grace] Tho' the group'd Trees that boast a wilder Grace, Steal from the Painter's Art their varied Site, And their rich Mass of Shadow and of Light, Where Nature's seeming Negligence we trace; Yet, ye long Avenues, of awful Height And mystic Air,—shall Fancy dare efface The hoary Grandeur of your Gothic Race?— While spreading a Cathedral Gloom, unite Your Pillars, in immeasurable Shade, With the dim Arch, that waving to the Beam Of sportive Day, for Ages, hath portray'd The restless Image of a billowy Stream Shot on the “chequer'd Earth,” This beautiful Image is borrowed from Mr. Cowper's “Task.” whose Walks below Dance to the cheated Eye, with undulating Flow! SONNET the TENTH. [View'd thro' this beauteous Vista, where the Bloom] View'd thro' this beauteous Vista, where the Bloom Of flowering Ash disparted to the Day, Bade from the Cloud the Sun's emerging Ray Some Moments past, my root-wove Seat illume, And let the brighten'd Landscape thro' the Gloom,— How many a pleasing Object pass'd away! The dim Sail, while the Branches scarce gave Room On the calm Wave its Glimmering to survey; And, where fleet Shadows floated o'er the Lawn, The scatter'd Sheep that cross'd my charmed Eye; And near that Hill, its sidelong Mists withdrawn, The Hawk that pounc'd to Earth—then hover'd high; And yet more near, the little playful Fawn Amid those silver Alders, frisking by! SONNET the ELEVENTH. [Tho' now pale Eve, with many a crimson Streak] Tho' now pale Eve, with many a crimson Streak Soft-fading, tips the Lime-invested Hill; And tho' blue Steams emerging from the Lake Roll curling on, and hover o'er the Rill; The Smoke, that slow evolves its pillar'd Form From yonder Straw-roof'd Cottage, sweetly throws O'er my hush'd Bosom a superior Charm, And seems to breathe a cherub-like Repose! With its grey Column to yon' sapphire Cloud Stealing in Stillness, the calm Mind ascends— The unruffled Line, tho' lost amid the Shroud Of Heaven, in Fancy rising, never ends! Thus ever may my tranquil Spirit rise Free from the Gust of Passion—to the Skies! SONNET the TWELFTH. [Say, favorite Shades, beneath whose laurel Vest] Say, favorite Shades, beneath whose laurel Vest The wild Rose blushes, and pale Woodbines flaunt— Say, why no longer vocal, tho' the Haunt Erewhile, of many a little warbling Guest; Where musing oft, my charmed Ear was wont (As peep'd the callow Finches from their Nest) To listen to the Parent's Song, and rest On each sweet Trill, and bid vain Care avaunt— Ah! whilst no more the gold-ting'd Artist weaves His mossy Fabric with assiduous Bill; Tho' round the rich Luxuriance of the Leaves And Flowers, the Breeze with lavish Odors fill— Ah, for such artless Music, Fancy heaves Full many a Sigh, amidst a Pause so still! SONNET the THIRTEENTH. [Go, Limner,—if with Autumn's varied Realm] Go, Limner,—if with Autumn's varied Realm The mimic Canvas e'er presum'd to vie— Go, mark the Leaves of that Time-hollow'd Elm Which steal thro' many a Teint, to fade and die. Say, as the wildest of the sylvan Scene, That Elm collecting each autumnal Hue, Waves the pale Vesture of a faded Green Shot with Heaven's Lightning, to the bleak East View; Mild o'er its brighter Leaves while Zephyrs blow; To the drear North while browner Dyes unfold; And softly sprinkled 'mid the Boughs below The shadowy Purple mellows into Gold— Say, has thy happiest Pencil e'er pourtray'd Such mingled Colors, so reliev'd by Shade? SONNET the FOURTEENTH. [See the light Breeze the quivering Aspin stirs] See the light Breeze the quivering Aspin stirs, Whose snowy Bark and yellow Foliage throw Their mingled Glimmering thro' the russet Row Of stripling Oaks, and Green-invested Firs! Yet Fancy, with delighted Voice avers, That to the Muse's Eye new Beauties flow; For, as the Charms of melting Color glow, The sweet Delusion of the Scene is hers! And see that Cloud empurpled sails away, And on its soft and fleecy Fragments steal Faint lilac Tints, while now the westering Day Scarce flings, amid this variegated Vale, Thro' yon' cleft Rock, a twilight-tinctur'd Ray To meet the feebler Glance of Hesper pale! SONNET the SEVENTEENTH. To Mr. Pratt, on reading his “Landscapes in Verse.” Written September, 1785. Whilst with luxuriant Pride the “Landscape” flows That speaks the Efforts of an Artist's Hand,— And (tho' unfinish'd Groupes obscurely stand) In rich warm Tints the new Creation glows— At Orient Morn, or Evening's mellow Close A sweet Elysium, or a fairy Land;— Whilst thro' the Still-Life Scene Cleone throws The Heart's enchanting Int'rest, 'mid the Band Of Innocence and Youth and sighing Love And rustic Joy;—shall not my ruder Lay (Calm o'er my Bosom if Complacence move) To its inspiring Source fond Homage pay? And, tho' unblest by kindred Genius, prove That kindred Feeling sheds as kind a Ray? SONNET the EIGHTEENTH. To the Reverend Mr. Whitaker, Author of the History of Manchester, On his expressing his Approbation of the “Art of Eloquence.” Written November, 1785. Thy Volumes, opening to my curious Gaze Their num'rous Pages deepen'd with the Shade Of antique Wisdom's mystic Lore, I read, While all my Frame the Powers of Wonder seize! Yet, rapt in high Delight, I see the Rays Of luminous Description oft pervade The historic Gloom, when rushes to thy Aid Energic Fancy rob'd in solar Blaze— —How then (my Bosom yet misgiving sighs) How can the Historian, whose sublimer Views Far—far above my loftiest Efforts rise, The Precepts of Didactic Song peruse?— And with the Candor of approving Eyes Light to fair Honors the sequester'd Muse? SONNET the NINETEENTH. Presented to Major Drewe, with a Translation of the Military Poems of Tyrtæus.—January 26, 1786. Forgive the Muse, nor deem her honest Line A Strain, that might betray the Flatterer's Art Obstrusive; if assiduous to impart The Applause which Truth devotes on Merit's Shrine. She marks the Feeling and the Taste that shine Fair in thy cultur'd Mind and liberal Heart; And hails the Lustre of a Scipio thine: While thro' thy brilliant Page new Beauties dart, Mix'd with the noble Fervor of a Soul Where bright the Flame of conscious Honor burns! And such a Spirit as indignant spurns Each crouching Slave; and blots from Valor's Roll The Homage cold mechanic Duty pays Too regular for Blame—too dull for Praise! SONNET the TWENTIETH. To the AUTHOR, on seeing his Plan for a History of Devonshire, 1790. By Dr. Downman, M. D. of Exeter. O'er barren Ground, my Friend, thou takest thy Way, Where scarcely blows a solitary Flower; Not in these Haunts obscure the Muses stray, Nor here hath Fancy raised her Myrtle Bower. Yet should Encouragement with gentle Voice Bid thee amid the desart Rocks proceed, Should liberal Candour sanctify thy Choice, And mark each Step, her Smile the promised Meed, Thou wilt not shrink; for Genius early taught To stoop beneath chaste Reason's Sway austere, The undissipated Soul with Learning fraught, Can change their Subject; firmly persevere; And scorning Obstacles a Victory gain Where labouring Dulness still would plod in vain. EPISTLE TO A COLLEGE-FRIEND, WRITTEN IN THE COUNTRY Some Years after the Author had left the University. While yet 'tis mine to trace the feeling Hour, And win young Fancy from the Muses Bower, Ere pressing Cares, too numerous, intervene To disenchant the bosom-soothing Scene; Come, nor so soon, alas! to Memory fade Ye Views, fast-fainting into sombre Shade! O come, where never Cares engender'd Strife, Ye spotless Visions of untroubled Life! There may I colour, where our College-Day Triumph'd in youthful Spirits light and gay, The generous Mind expanding into Joy, While no mean Passion mixt its base Alloy; Melt o'er our parting Moments not in vain, Fresh as I read my Greville's Heart again; Rescue each Sparkle of our wishing Eyes, And from severe Oblivion steal our Sighs! Far from our letter'd Groves when Fancy droops, Or feebly pencils her aerial Groupes; When dull Realities, fast gathering round, Scatter the Forms that dance on fairy Ground; Thy dear Idea lightens up the whole, And gilds with friendly Rays my soften'd Soul! 'Tis then I see the sacred Domes arise, And WOLSEY's tower-crown'd Gateway pierce the Skies; And pass the gothic Arch in eager Haste, And greet the Bowers that nurs'd our kindred Taste: Fond to renew the philologic Task, Tho' wakeful Study ten long Hours may ask; But, still with all our former Feelings, prone To fly the Circles of the Problem-Drone. 'Tis then, my vernal Ardors kindling fast, I hover o'er the Phantom of the past; And cry: “how little were they dash'd with Woe— The Days, when Euclid was our only Foe! Tho' doom'd to stretch Attention on the Rack That twists the Cranium of the plodding Pack, We found our mathematic Toils repaid By the sweet Contrast of the classic Shade; There met, with all the Enthusiast's glowing Rage, The trophied Chiefs of many a former Age; Mus'd o'er the historic Tales that simply tell How Roman Glory rose, how Athens fell; And caught each Accent of the Critic's Tongue That gave new Lustre to Mæonian Song! Nor vainly-whispering, Emulation sway'd— We heard the grateful Murmur, and obey'd: Whether the Strife of Declamation blew The Sparks of young Invention into View; Or, as the Flame our weekly Theses fann'd, We tremulously join'd the Theme-struck Band, Where the long Hall, with hoary Portraits hung, Its iron-wreathed Gate far open flung; Or, as Collections breath'd the pale Affright Thro' the still Vigils of the studious Night, Each closing Term our kindred Wishes crown'd, And BAGOT smil'd Applause, nor JACKSON frown'd! Yet Memory with a fonder Glance pursues Of vagrant Joy the many-colour'd Views— Congenial Bliss that, bosom'd in the Vale, Drank the first Fragrance of the Summer-Gale; The Painter's Taste, that saw mild Autumn print Far on the whispering Groves her magic Tint; And Converse that, with Attic Humour fraught, Sported in all the free Career of Thought. How often have we climb'd the breezy Mound, And gaz'd upon the Hamlet's distant Bound; And, sauntering, criticis'd the pastoral Notes Of Peasants whistling near their wattled Cotes; O'erleap'd the Stream, or trod the mossy Plank That trembled to the quaking Willow-Bank; And reach'd the forest-Skirts, that struck the Sight A Mass of Shadow and of yellow Light— That to pale Crimson, as the Sunbeams sunk, Resign'd the Brightness of the burnish'd Trunk; When the Night-Warbler's melancholy Lay Stealing in liquid Stillness on the Day 'Till each cool Cloud had lost its lilac Hue, Our Sympathies to every Quaver drew; And the retiring Landskape seem'd to faint Into such Shade as MELCHIER lov'd to paint, 'Till, curtain'd all, we heard, slow pacing Home, The far-off Echoes of the mighty Tom! How oft, as less excursive Fancy mov'd, Not unimpeded by our Gowns we rov'd— (Our careless Gowns that vaunted no Degree) And climb'd the Hill, and hail'd Joe Pullen's Tree; Or winded thro' our own contiguous Glade, Or Merton waving wild its bowering Shade. How oft, quick-passing the piazza'd Dome, We pierc'd, great ADDISON, thy holy Gloom, And own'd thee CATO's Bard, the Beech beneath Whose brazen Plates, gigantic Armour, sheath The hollow Stem from Ruin, to proclaim How Maudlin-Fellows prize a Poet's Fame— Or hint, that ev'n to college-Wisdom clings A secret Craving for less shadowy Things! Nor seldom, where the Skiff light-glancing flew Or flash'd the Colors of the gay Canoe, The Summer's swift-descending Hour we gave To social Pastime on the classic Wave; The Paddler's Evolutions pleas'd to mark From the broad Benches of our safer Bark, Whether beneath the wide-spread Awning glow'd Our circling Glass, while trowser'd Rustics row'd; Or to hale Exercise we strove to pour The fluid Silver from each feather'd Oar; Or strait becalm'd, where low-incumbent Trees Wav'd to the Whisper of the shifting Breeze, Among the rustling Sedge and Lilies moist Mourn'd our rude Efforts that essay'd to hoist The slacken'd Sails no more by Zephyrs fill'd, And ran aground, in Steerage all unskill'd. Ah then, what pleasing Murmurs swell'd the Gales— The village-Merriment that never fails; The Skittler's Noise beside the o'ershadow'd Roof; Fast o'er the level Mead each prancing Hoof; The Shouts of many an academic Buck O'er diving Spaniels and the quaking Duck; From fragrant Haycocks, where with wooden Fork They plied 'till darkling Eve their frolic Work, The Laugh, loud-echoed, of the sunburnt Throng; And, still more sweet, the Milkmaid's simple Song. Faint as the Sounds at distance seem'd to die, The Smoke, that curl'd o'er Godstowe, caught our Eye. And the pale Fane, with duskier Ivy hung As the hoar Moss beneath its Meshes clung; The monkish Record on the rifted Wall, Ill-rhym'd the buried Beauty to recall; The Labyrinth's secret Maze, but dimly seen, Where Rosamonda fled her tyrant Queen— Our Spirits wafted, in a wizard Trance, Far back into the Days of old Romance! Oft too, when Winter bade his Torrents rush O'er the dank Meads, and hide each scatter'd Bush, What Time the Tempest all the Skies o'ercast, We wander'd wild, and buffeted the Blast; And from the Hill, whose Summit overbrow'd Fair Isis' Towers, survey'd the heaving Cloud; Shrunk from the leafless Tree's fantastic Form, Now bent to Earth, now straining to the Storm; And, as congenial Terror touch'd our Minds, Beheld the brooding Spirit of the Winds Sail downward to the Vale, and sudden throw His bursting Gloom on Isis' Towers below. Meanwhile, retreated from the pathless Waste Our pensive Steps the glimmering Cloyster pac'd, Where at each whistling Gale, each Murmur deep, Scar'd Fancy saw the beckoning Spectre sweep; 'Till, satiate, the cathedral Aisles around, With every dreary Sight and dismal Sound, We hail'd, (no longer wrapt in wintry Glooms) The cheerful Blaze illumining our Rooms: Where MASON's Muse the charm'd Attention took, Or unconfin'd we rov'd from Book to Book; Or, as our desultory Converse flow'd, The differing Spirit of Opinion glow'd, That haply started, in the warm Dispute, MONBODDO sinking Man into a Brute. 'Twas thus, from all but surly Censors free, In thoughtful Musing or in social Glee We spent our Eve; now reason'd and now rhym'd, And sat, 'till Chapel-Bells had duly chim'd. Yet, tho' our Supper we postpon'd for Prayers As the late Vespers clos'd our college-Cares, Returning with an added Friend in haste, We shar'd, like HORACE, a divine Repast. Not that luxurious Appetite, uncheck'd, Long'd for such Cates as graduate Mouths expect; Since, oft, at broken Vespers, we deplor'd Our cooling Commons on the silent Board, And found, each heavenly Aspiration o'er, The Cutlets, smoaking once, that smoak'd no more! These were our sore Vexations! Yet unchill'd Gay Fancy sparkled, as our Glasses fill'd. Then the fair Outline of our Hopes we drew, And fondly nurs'd them, as each Figure grew; Sketch'd for our different Friends the future Plan, And form'd our Systems, as our Wishes ran; Contented crown'd a Living with a Wife, Nor mark'd the varied Ills that checquer Life; View'd, halcyon-bright, domestic Ease appear, Now saw pale Grief distain it with a Tear; Bade the sweet Pledges of Affection rise, To melting Blushes and entrancing Eyes; Pictur'd the Bliss of Love's romantic Morn, And prest the rosy Couch, without a Thorn! But ah! too soon the dear delusive Dream Fled, with the golden Groves of Academe! Too soon, in Scenes of vulgar Life, I found The Hoarfrost scatter'd by Indifference round; While Envy's Cloud diffus'd its sullen Gloom, And Blasts from Avarice nip'd young Fancy's Bloom! Ev'n now, tho' wedded Love on pure Esteem Shed the sweet Influence of its ardent Beam; Tho' Praise from cold Extinction guard the Fire That feebly glows, and trembles o'er my Lyre; Yet, as my former Days in Prospect rise, I mourn, full often, with regretful Sighs, The Contrast of Civilities that mark The affected Tribe who feel no friendly Spark— Who with Contempt or Apathy behold The brightest Talents unattach'd to Gold! Here too, within these Walls, I oft recur To Scenes that quick the Sense of Sorrow stir; Where, watching at each Gleam his vital Fire, I saw my little Innocent expire: While Care, intruding on my Anguish, fills My Bosom with a Store of meaner Ills; And Prudence, acting her mechanic Part, Deadens the fine Emotions of the Heart. Meantime the Race, who boast no Tenets cramp Their easy Hours, my pastoral Duties damp, The Pulpit's see-saw Stuff profanely mock, And spread contagious Poison thro' my Flock! Ah! be it ours to fly so mean a Tribe, Nor the cold Maxims of the World imbibe; To bid no generous Sentiment expire, And yet, tho' distant, breathe Affection's Fire! And while, beneath this low-sequester'd Thatch, I scorn the false Opinions that attach The ignoble Great to many a vain Pursuit, And mark of all their Toils the bitter Fruit; Whilst here, undazzled by a Poet's Fame, I fondly cherish the connubial Flame, And rear my little Offspring, fond to trace The Mother's Features in the Suckling's Face; And hold the sweet Compassion doubly dear That drops o'er Woe the solitary Tear; O may my GREVILLE, since his Spirits glide With fervid Impulse in a stronger Tide, The Christian Patriot's pure Ambition feel, A bright Example of unerring Zeal! And, if kind Heaven in Wisdom hath decreed The Radiance of a Mitre for his Meed, Be his, amidst the Venal and the Proud, The officious Fawner and the unfeeling Crowd, Be his to value Independence most, And, not a Spark of early Virtue lost, Muse o'er the Mirror calm Reflexion rears, And view it spotless thro' the Lapse of Years! THE LOCK TRANSFORMED. Written 1782. Dear was the Moment, when the gentle Fair Gave to my Wishes with consenting Eyes, A Lock that sever'd from her lovely Hair Could soften all my Bosom into Sighs! And dear those Moments that so sweetly stole A Pang from Absence, and impell'd my Lyre To wake the fond Emotions of the Soul, In melting Ardors and a Poet's Fire! Then Fancy stream'd her Visions on the Muse, And many a transitory Form portray'd, Pictur'd aërial Sylphs in vivid Hues, And bade their little Wings the Lock o'ershade. But quick their fluid Shapes dissolve in Air, And other Beings rise, as Fancy wills— Lo drawn by Turtles in her Ivory Car, Appears the Goddess of the Paphian Hills! And thus: “That Ringlet to my Power resign— “For from its kindred Tresses tho' it part, “To give it brighter Beauties shall be mine, “With all the Skill of imitative Art. “What tho' the fam'd Belinda's ravish'd Hair “May add new Glory to the distant Skies— “Yet shall thy Laura's Lock eclipse the Star “That vainly shoots, and kindles as it flies! “Chang'd to the Semblance of a Female Form (“The fairest that a Deity can feign) “Can this with all the Glow of Colors warm, “Start into mimic Life, to bloom in vain?” She said—and from my Hand the Ringlet caught, And sudden to my wondering Sight display'd Thy Gift, my Laura, to a Picture wrought, With all the varied Charms of Light and Shade! And “here,” she cried, (while round the fluttering Loves Breath'd on the roseate Cheeks their softest Blooms) “Behold a Nymph, more gentle than my Doves, “Or Zephyr, sighing 'midst my Cyprian Glooms! “See the pure Spirit of a native Grace “To all her Mien a lovelier Air impart! “And see that meek Expression of a Face “Where in each genuine Look we read the Heart! “These speaking Eyes a Charm from Nature steal “Which vainly would the Rhetor's Power supply; “For ah, more sweetly-eloquent we feel “The Language of the never-silent Eye! “Nor let her Attic Robe escape thy View “That no vain-tinsell'd Pageantry betrays— “Such as the Pencil of Apelles drew, “And Grecian Virgins wore, in antient Days! “'Twas then the Spirit of this Nymph divine “Shone, to Electra's Bard, in golden Dreams; “As oft he woo'd the Favors of the Nine “Amidst the Murmur of Ilyssus' Streams. “But ah—how long—how heavily opprest “While Athens moulder'd into Dust, she lay— “With Gothic Darkness brooding o'er her Breast, “That gloom'd the Sweetness of her Soul away! “If e'er the Bards of Arno's oliv'd Vale “A wild Note warbled to the pensive Maid, “Full soon, unheeding the degenerate Tale, “She fled, with many a Sigh, from Pisa's Shade. “Next, in her favorite Isle, the Harp she strung— “The British Minstrels triumph'd, as she came— “Hail'd her—divine Simplicity; and sung “With all Aonia's Harmony, her Name. “Mark then her Image, as depictur'd here “She gives to Zephyr her Æolian Shell; “And mark that Altar, which low-rising, near “Yon' Poplar, crowns the solitary Dell. “Glares round its Pedestal no quaint Design; “Nor aught that meretricious Art can boast: “To Nature rear'd, the unaspiring Shrine “Appears, ‘while unadorn'd, adorn'd the most.’ “Lo there she bids, arrang'd with happiest Taste, “The Primrose and the Violet to diffuse “Their mingled Sweets, and blend in Union chaste “Their Colors sombred o'er by twilight Dews: “While my soft Star, that loves, each Evening Hour, “To hover o'er the Stillness of the Dale, “Amid the dim Leaves of the Poplar-Bower “Sheds on the shadowy Shrine, a Lustre pale. “From thence no spicy Clouds involve the Skies— “Her humbler Offering are yon' vernal Wreaths— “And all the Incense of her Sacrifice “Is but the Incense that a Field-flower breathes!” She spoke—and gave the Picture to my Care— And in the rich Possession call'd me blest! “And place it next thy Heart (she cried) for there “That heaving Sigh already tells the rest! “Go then—where Imitation's utmost Art “Has faintly copied (tho' employ'd by me) “The bright Original that fires thy Heart— “Go—and the living Form in Laura see!” FINIS.</field>
