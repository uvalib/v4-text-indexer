      <field name="fulltext">[Emblemes] To my much Honoured, and no lesse truly beloved Friend EDW. BENLOWES Esquire [By Fathers, backt; by Holy Writ, led on] By Fathers, backt; by Holy Writ, led on, Thou shew'st a way to Heav'n, by Helicon: The Muses Font is consecrate by Thee, And Poesie, baptiz'd Divinitie: Blest soule, that here embark'st: Thou sayl'st apace, 'Tis hard to say, mov'd more by Wit, or Grace; Each Muse so plyes her Oare; But O, the Sayle Is fill'd from heav'n with a Diviner Gale: When Poets prove Divines, why should not I Approve, in Verse, this Divine Poetry? Let this suffice to licence thee the Presse; I must no more; nor could the Truth say lesse. Sic approbavit RICH. LOVE Procan. Cantabrigiensis. THE FIRST BOOKE The Invocation Rowze thee, my soul; and dreine thee from the dregs Of vulgar thoughts. Skrue up the heightned pegs Of thy Sublime Theorboe foure notes higher, And higher yet; that so, the shrill-mouth'd Quire Of swift-wing'd Seraphims may come and joyne, And make thy Consort more than halfe divine. Invoke no Muse; Let heav'n be thy Apollo And let his sacred Influences hallow Thy high-bred Straynes; Let his full beames inspire Thy ravisht braines with more heroick fire; Snatch thee a Quill from the spread Eagles wing, And, like the morning Lark, mount up and sing: Cast off these dangling Plummets, that so clog Thy lab'ring heart, which gropes in this dark fog Of dungeon earth; Let flesh and blood forbeare To stop thy flight, till this base world appeare A thin blew Landskip; Let thy pineons sore So high a pitch, that men may seeme no more Than Pismires, crawling on this Mole-hill earth Thy eare untroubled with their frantick mirth; Let not the frailty of thy flesh disturbe Thy new-concluded peace; Let Reason curbe Thy hot-mouth'd Passions; and let heav'ns fire season The fresh Conceits of thy corrected Reason; Disdaine to warme thee at Lusts smoaky fires, Scorne, scorne to feed on thy old bloat desires: Come; come, my Soule, hoyse up thy higher Sayles, The wind blowes faire: Shall we creep like Snayles, That gild their wayes with their owne native slimes? No, we must flie like Eagles, and our Rhimes Must mount to heav'n, and reach th'Olympick eare; Our heav'n-blowne fire must seek no other Spheare: Thou great Theanthropos, that giv'st and crown'st Thy gifts in dust; and, from our dunghill, own'st Reflected Honour, taking by Retayle, (What thou hast giv'n in grosse) from lapsed, fraile, And sinfull man, that drink'st full draughts, wherein Thy Childrens leprous fingers, scurf'd with Sin; Have padled, cleanse, O cleanse my crafty Soule From secret Crimes, and let my thoughts controule My thoughts: O, teach me stoutly to deny My selfe, that I may be no longer I; Enrich my Fancy, clarifie my thoughts, Refine my drosse, O, wink at humane faults; And, through this slender Conduit of my Quill, Convey thy Current, whose cleare streames may fill The hearts of men with love, their tongues with praise; Crowne me with Glory: Take, who list, the Bayes. I. JAMES I. XIV. Every man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his own lust, and enticed. Serpent. Eve. Serpent: Not eat? Not taste? Not touch? Not cast an eye Upon the fruit of this faire Tree? And why? Why eat'st thou not what Heav'n ordain'd for food? Or can'st thou think that bad, which heav'n call'd Good? Why was it made, if not to be enjoy'd? Neglect of favours makes a favour voyd: Blessings unus'd pervert into a Wast, As well as Surfeits; Woman, Do but tast; See how the laden boughs make silent Suit To be enjoyd; Look, how their bending Fruit Meet thee halfe way; Observe but how they crouch To kisse thy hand; Coy woman, Do but touch: Mark what a pure Vermilion blush has dy'd Their swelling Cheeks, and how, for shame, they hide Their palsie heads, to see themselves stand by Neglected: Woman, Do but cast an eye: What bounteous heav'n ordain'd for use, refuse not; Come, pull and eat; y'abuse the things ye use not. Eve: Wisest of Beasts, our great Creator did, Reserve this Tree, and this alone forbid; The rest are freely ours, which, doubtlesse, are As pleasing to the Tast; to the eye, as faire But touching this, his strict commands are such, 'Tis death to tast, no lesse than death, to touch. Serpent: P'sh; death's a fable. Did not heav'n inspire Your equall Elements with living Fire, Blowne from the Spring of life? Is not that breath Immortall? Come; ye are as free from death As He that made ye: Can the flames expire Which He has kindled? Can ye quench His fire? Did not the great Creator's voice proclaime What ere he made (from the blue spangled frame To the poore leafe that trembles) very Good? Blest He not both the Feeder, and the Food? Tell, tell me, then, what a danger can accrue From such blest Food, to such Halfe-gods as you? Curb needlesse feares, and let no fond conceit Abuse your freedome; woman, Take and eat. Eve: 'Tis true; we are immortall; death is yet Unborne; and, till Rebellion make it debt, Undue; I know the Fruit is good, untill Presumtuous disobedience make it ill: The lips that open to this Fruit's a portall To let in death, and make immortall, mortall. Serpent: You cannot die; Come, woman, Tast and feare not: Eve: Shall Eve transgresse? I dare not, O I dare not. Serpent: Afraid? why draw'st thou back thy tim'rous Arme? Harme onely fals on such as feare a Harme: Heav'n knows and feares the vertue of this Tree: 'Twill make ye perfect Gods as well as He. Stretch forth thy hand, and let thy fondnesse never Feare death: Do, pull, and eat, and live for ever. Eve: 'Tis but an Apple; and it is as good To do as to desire: Fruit's made for food: Ile pull, and tast, and tempt my Adam too To know the secrets of this dainty; Serpent: Doe. S. CHRYS. sup. Matth. He forc'd him not: He touch'd him not: Onely said Cast thyself downe; that we may know, whosoever obeyes the Divell, casts himslf downe; For the Divell may suggest; compell, he cannot. S. BERN. in Ser. It is the Divels part to suggest; Ours, not to consent: As oft we resist him, so often we overcome him: as often as we overcome him, so often we bring joy to the Angels, and glory to God; Who proposes us, that we may contend, and assists us, that we may conquer. EPIGRAM 1. [Unluckie Parliament! wherein, at last.] Unluckie Parliament! wherein, at last. Both Houses are agreed, and firmly past An Act of death, confirm'd by higher Powers: O had it had but such success as Ours. II. JAMES I. XV. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 1 Lament, lament; Looke, looke what thou hast done! Lament the worlds, lament thine owne Estate; Looke, looke, by doing, how thou art undone; Lament thy fall; lament thy change of State: Thy Faith is broken, and thy Freedome gone, See, see too soone, what thou lament'st too late: O thou that wert so many men; nay, all Abridg'd in one, how has thy desp'rate fall Destroid thy unborne seed, destroid thyself withall! 2 Uxorious Adam, whom thy Maker made Equall to Angels, that excell in pow'r, What hast thou done? O why hast thou obayd Thy owne destruction? Like a new-cropt flowre How does the glory of the beauty fade! How are thy fortunes blasted in an houre! How art thou cow'd, that hadst the pow'r to quell The spite of new-faln Angels; baffle Hell, And vye with those that stood, and vanquish those that fell! 3 See how the world (whose chast and pregnant wombe, Of late, conceiv'd and brought forth nothing ill) Is now degenerated, and become A base Adultresse, whose wombe false Births do fill The Earth with Monsters, Monsters that do rome And rage about, and make a Trade, to kill: Now Glutt'ny paunches; Lust begins to spawne; Wrath takes revenge; and Avarice, a pawne Pale Envy pines; Pride swels; and Sloth begins to yawne. 4 The Ayre, that whisper'd, now begins to roare, And blustring Boreas blowes the boyling Tide; The white-mouthed Water now usurpes the Shore, And scornes the pow'r of her trydentall Guides; The Fire now burnes, that did but warme before, And rules her Ruler with resistlesse Pride; Fire, Water, Earth and Ayre, that first were made To be subdu'd, see, how they now invade; They rule whom once they serv'd; command, where once obaid. 5 Behold; that nakednesse, that late bewraid Thy Glory, now's become thy shame, thy wonder; Behold; those Trees whose various Fruits were made For food, now turn'd a Shade to shrowd thee under: Behold; That voice (which thou hast disobayd) That late was Musick, now affrights like Thunder: Poore man! Are not thy Joynts grown sore with shaking To view th'effect of thy bold undertaking That in one houre didst marre, what heav'n six dayes was making. S. AUGUST. lib. 1 de lib. arbit. It is a most just punishment, that man should lose that Freedome which man would not use, yet had power to keep if he would: And that he who had knowledge to do what was right, and did not, should be deprived of the knowledge of what was right; And that he who would not doe righteously when he had the power, should lose the power to do it, when he had the will. HUGO de anima. They are justly punished that abuse lawfull things, but they are more justly punished, that use unlawful things; Thus Lucifer fell from heaven; thus Adam lost his Paradise. EPIGRAM 2. [See how these fruitfull kernels, being cast] See how these fruitfull kernels, being cast Upon the earth, how thick they spring! how fast! A full-Crop, and thriving; rank and proud; Prepost'rous man first sow'd, and then he plough'd. III. PROVERBS XIV. XIII. Even in laughter the heart is sorrowfull, and the end of that mirth is heavinesse. 1 Alas fond Child How are thy thoughts beguil'd, To hope for Hony from a nest of wasps? Thou maist as well Go seek for ease in Hell, Or sprightly Nectar from the mouthes of Asps. 2 The world's a Hive, From whence thou canst derive No good, but what thy soules vexation brings: Put case thou meet Some peti-peti-sweet, Each drop is guarded with a thousand stings. 3 Why dost thou make These murm'ring Troupes forsake The safe Protection of their waxen Homes? This Hive containes No sweet that's worth thy paines; There's nothing here, alas, but empty Combes. 4 For trash and Toyes, And griefe-ingendring Joyes What torment seemes too sharpe for flesh and blood! What bitter Pills, Compos'd of reall Ills, Man swallowes downe, to purchase one false Good! 5 The dainties here, Are least what they appeare; Though sweet in hopes, yet in fruition, sowre: The fruit that's yellow, Is found not alwayes mellow, The fairest Tulip's not the sweetest flowre. 6 Fond youth, give ore, And vexe thy soule no more, In seeking, what were better far unfounded; Alas thy gaines Are onely present paines To gather Scorpions for a future wound. 7 What's earth? or in it, That longer than a minit Can lend a free delight, that can endure? O who would droyle Or delve in such a soyle, Where gaine's uncertaine, and the paine is sure? S. AUGUST. Sweetnesse in temporall matters is deceitfull: It is a labour and a perpetuall feare; It is a dangerous pleasure, whose beginning is without providence, and whose end is not without repentance. HUGO. Luxury is an enticing pleasure, a bastard mirth, which hath honey in her mouth, gall in her heart, and a sting in her taile. EPIGRAM 3. [What, Cupid, Are thy shafts already made?] What, Cupid, Are thy shafts already made? And seeking Honey, to set up thy Trade? True Emblemes of thy sweets! Thy Bees do bring Hony, in their mouths, but in their tailes, a sting. IV. PSALMS LXII. IX. To be laid in the ballance, it is altogether lighter than vanitie. 1 Put in another weight: 'Tis yet, too light: And yet. Fond Cupid put another in; And yet, another: Still there's under weight; Put in another Hundred: Put agin: Add world to world; then heape a thousand more To that; then, to renew thy wasted store, Take up more worlds on trust, to draw thy Balance lower. 2 Put in the flesh, with all her loads of pleasure; Put in great Mammons endlesse Inventory; Put in the pondrous Acts of mighty Caesar; Put in the greater weight of Suedens Glory; Add Scipios gauntlet; put in Platos Gowne; Put Circes Charmes, put in the Triple Crowne, Thy Balance will not draw; thy Balance will not downe. 3 LORD, what a world this is; which, day and night, Men seek with so much toyle, with so much trouble! Which, weigh'd in equall Scales, is found so light, So poorely over-balanc'd with a Bubble; Good GOD! that frantick mortals should destroy Their higher Hopes, and place their idle Joy Upon such ayry Trash, upon so light a Toy! 4 Thou bold Imposture, how hast thou befool'd The tribe of Man, with counterfeit desire! How has the breath of thy false bellowes cool'd Heav'ns free-borne flames, and kindled bastard fire! How hast thou vented Drosse instead of treasure, And cheated man with thy false weights and measure, Proclaiming Bad for Good; and gilding death with pleasure! 5 The world's a crafty Strumpet, most affecting, And closely following those that most reject her; But seeming carelesse, nicely disrespecting And coyly flying those that most affect her: If thou be free, shee's strange; if strange, shee's free; Flee, and she followes; Follow, and shee'l flee; Than she there's none more coy; there's none more fond than she. 6 O, what a Crocadilian world is this, Compos'd of trech'ries, and ensnaring wiles! She cloathes destruction in a formall kisse, And lodges death in her deceitfull smiles: She huggs the soule she hates; and, there, does prove The veryest Tyrant, where she vowes to love And is a Serpent most, when most she seemes a Dove. 7 Thrice happy He, whose nobler thoughts despise To make an Object of so easie Gaines; Thrice happy He, who scornes so poore a Prize Should be the Crowne of his heroick paines: Thrice happy He, that nev'r was borne to trie Her frownes or smiles; or, being borne, did lie In his sad Nurses Armes an houre or two, and die. S. AUGUST. lib. Confess. O you that dote upon this world, for what victory do ye fight?

Gone are those golden dayes, wherein Pale Conscience started not at ugly sin; When good old Saturnes peacefull Throne Was unusurped by his beardlesse Sonne: When jealous Ops nev'r fear'd th'abuse Of her chast bed, or breach of nuptiall Truce: When just Astraea poys'd her Scales In mortall hearts, whose absence earth bewailes: When froth-borne Venus, and her Brat, With all that spurious brood young Jove begat, In horrid shapes, were yet unknowne; Those Halcyon dayes, that golden Age is gone: There was no Clyent then, to wait The leisure of his long-tayl'd Advocate; The Talion Law was in request, And Chaunc'ry Courts were kept in ev'ry brest: Abused Statutes had no Tenters, And men could deale secure, without Indentures; There was no peeping hole, to cleare The Wittols eye from his incarnate feare; There were no lustfull Cinders, then, To broyle the Carbonado'd hearts of men; The rosie Cheeke did, then, proclaime A shame of Guilt, but not a guilt of Shame; There was no whining soule, to start At Cupids twang, or curse his flaming dart; The Boy had, then, but callow wings, And fell Erynnis Scorpions had no stings; The better acted world did move Upon the fixed Poles of Truth and Love; Love essenc'd in the hearts of men; Then, Reason rul'd; There was no Passion, then; Till Lust and Rage began to enter, Love the Circumf'rence was, and Love, the Center; Untill the wanton dayes of Jove, The simple world was all compos'd of Love; But Jove grew fleshly, false, unjust; Inferiour Beauty fill'd his veynes with Lust; And Cucqueane Junos Fury hurld Fierce Balls of Rage into th'incestuous World: Astraea fled; and Love return'd From earth: Earth boyl'd with Lust; with Rage, it burn'd And ever since the world has beene Kept going with the scourge of Lust, and Spleene. S. AMBEROS. Lust is a sharpe spurre to vice, which alwayes puts the Affections into a false Gallop. HUGO. Lust is an immoderate wantonnesse of the flesh: a sweet poyson; a cruell pestilence; a pernitious potion, which weakens the body of man, and effeminates the strength of an heroick mind. S. AUGUST. Envy is the hatred of anothers felicity: In respect of Superiours, because they are not equall to them; In respect of Inferiours, lest they should be equall to them; In respect of equals, because they are equall to them: Through Envy proceeded the fall of the world, and the death of Christ.

All is vanitie and vexation of spirit. 1 How is the anxious soule of man befool'd In his desire, That thinks a Hectick Fever may be cool'd In flames of fire, Or hopes to rake full heapes of burnisht gold From nasty myre! A whining Lover may as well request A scornefull brest To melt in gentle teares, as woo the world for rest. 2 Let wit, and all her studied plots effect The best they can; Let smiling Fortune prosper, and perfect What wit began; Let earth advise with both, and so project A happy man; Let wit, or fawning Fortune vie their best; He may be blest With all that earth can give; but earth can give no Rest. 3 Whose Gold is double with a carefull hand, His cares are double; The Pleasure, Honour, Wealth of Sea and Land Bring but a trouble; The world it selfe, and all the worlds Command Is but a Bubble: The strong desires of mans insatiate brest May stand possest Of all that earth can give; but earth can give no Rest. 4 The world's a seeming Par'dise, but her owne And Mans Tormentor; Appearing fixt, yet but a rolling Stone, Without a Tenter; It is a vast Circumference, where none Can find a Center: Of more than earth, can earth make none possest; And he that least Regards this restlesse world, shall in this world find Rest. 5 True Rest consists not in the oft revying Of worldly drosse; Earths myry Purchase is not worth the buying; Her gaine is losse; Her Rest, but giddy toyle, if not relying Upon her Crosse; How worldlings droyle for trouble! That fond brest That is possest Of earth without a Crosse, has earth without a Rest. CASS. in Ps.

VII. I PETER V. VIII. Be sober; Be vigilant, because your adversary the Divell, as a roaring Lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour. 1 Why dost thou suffer lustfull sloth to creepe (Dull Cyprian lad) into thy wanton browes? Is this a time to pay thine idle vowes At Morpheus Shrine? Is this a time to sleepe Thy braines in wastfull slumbers? up and rouze Thy leaden spirits; Is this a time to sleepe? Adjourne thy sanguine dreames; Awake, arise; Call in thy Thoughts, and let them all advise, Hadst thou as many Heads, as thou hast wounded Eyes. 2 Looke, looke, what horrid Furies doe await Thy flattring slumbers; If thy drowzie head But chance to nod, thou falst into a Bed Of sulphrous flames, whose Torments want a date: Fond Boy, be wise; let not thy thoughts be fed With Phrygian wisdome; Fooles are wise too late: Beware betimes, and let thy Reason sever Those Gates which passion clos'd; wake now, or never: For if thou nod'st, thou fal'st; and, falling, fal'st for ever. 3 Mark, how the ready hands of death prepare; His Bow is bent, and he has notch'd his dart; He aimes, he levels at thy slumbring heart The wound is posting; O be wise; Beware; What? has the voice of danger lost the art To raise the spirit of neglected Care? Well; sleep thy fill; and take thy soft reposes; But know withall, sweet tasts have sower closes; And he repents in Thornes, that sleeps in Beds of Roses. 4 Yet, sluggard, wake, and gull thy soule no more, With earths false pleasure, and the world's delight, Whose fruit is faire, and pleasing to the sight, But sowre in tast; false, at the putrid Core: Thy flaring Glasse is Gemms at her halfe light; She makes thee seeming rich, but truly poore: She boasts a kernell, and bestowes a Shell; Performes an Inch of her faire promis'd Ell; Her words protest a Heav'n; Her works produce a Hell. 5 O thou, the fountaine of whose better part Is earth'd, and gravil'd up with vaine desire, That daily wallow'st in the fleshly mire And base pollution of a lustfull heart, That feel'st no passion but in wanton fire, And own'st no torment but from Cupids dart; Behold thy Type; Thou fitst upon this Ball Of earth, secure, while death, that stings at all, Stands arm'd to strike thee down, where flames attend thy fall. S. BERN. Security is no where; It is neither in heaven; nor in Paradise; much lesse in the world: In heaven, the Angels fell from the divine presence; In Paradise, Adam fell from his place of pleasure: In the world, Judas fell from the Schoole of our Saviour. HUGO. I eat secure; I drinke secure: I sleepe secure, even as though I had past the day of death, avoided the day of judgement, and escaped the torments of hell fire: I play and laugh, as though I were already triumphing in the kingdome of heaven.

VIII. LUKE VI. XXV. Woe be to you the laugh now, for ye shall mourne and weepe. The world's a popular disease, that raignes Within the froward heart, and frantick braines Of poore distemper'd mortals, oft arising From ill digestion, through th'unequall poysing Of ill-weigh'd Elements, whose light directs Malignant humors to maligne Effects: One raves, and labours with a boyling Liver: Rends haire by handfuls, cursing Cupids Quiver: Another, with a Bloody-fluxe of oathes, Vowes deepe Revenge; one dotes: the other loathes: One frisks and sings, and vyes a Flagon more To drench dry Cares; and makes the Welkin rore; Another droopes; the sunshine makes him sad; Heav'n cannot please; One's moap'd; the tother's mad; On huggs his Gold; Another lets it flie, He knowing not, for whom; nor, tother, why: One spends his day in Plots; his night, in Play; Another sleeps and slugs both night and day: One laughs at this thing; tother cries for that; But neither one, nor tother knowes for what: Wonder of wonders! What we ought t'evite As our disease, we hugg as our delight: 'Tis held a Symptome of approaching danger, When disacquainted Sense becomes a stranger, And takes no knowledge of an old disease; But when a noysome Griefe begins to please The unresisting Sense, it is a feare That death has parlyed, and compounded there: As when the dreadfull Thund'rers awefull hand Powres forth a Viall on th'infected land, At first th'affrighted Mortalls, quake, and feare, And ev'ry noyse is thought the Thunderer; But when the frequent Soule-departing Bell Has pav'd their eares with her familiar knell, It is reputed but a nine dayes wonder, They neither feare the Thund'rer, nor his Thunder; So when the world (a worse disease) began To smart for sin, poore new-created Man Could seek for shelter, and his gen'rous Son Knew, by his wages, what his hands had done; But bold-fac'd Mortalls, in our blushlesse times, Can sin and smile, and make a sport of Crimes, Transgresse of Custome, and rebell in ease; We false-joy'd fooles can triumph in disease, And (as the carelesse pilgim, being bit By the Tarantula, begins a Fit Of life-concluding laughter) wast our breath In lavish pleasure, till we laugh to death. HUGO de anima. What profit is there in vaine Glory, momentary mirth, the worlds power, the fleshes pleasure, full riches, noble descent, and great desires? Where is their laughter? Where is their mirth? Where their Insolence? Their Arrogance? From how much joy, to how much sadnesse! After how much mirth, how much misery? From how great glory are they fallen to how great torments! What hath fallen to them, may befall thee, because thou art a man: Thou art of earth; thou livest of earth; Thou shalt returne to earth. Death expects thee every where; be wise therefore, and expect death every where. EPIGRAM 8. [What ayles the foole to laugh? Does something please] What ayles the foole to laugh?

The world passeth away, and all the lusts thereof. 1 Draw neare, brave sparks, whose spirits scorne to light Your hallow'd Tapours, but at Honours flame; You, whose heroick Actions take delight To varnish over a new painted name; Whose high-bred thoughts disdaine to take their flight, But on th'Icarian wings of babbling Fame, Behold, how tottring are your high-built stories Of earth, whereon you trust the groundwork of your Glories. 2 And you, more brain-sick Lovers, that can prize A wanton smile before eternall Joyes; That know no heav'n but in your Mistresse eyes; That feele no pleasure but what sense enjoyes; That can, like crowne-distemper'd fooles despite True riches, and like Babies, whine for Toyes; Think ye, the pageants of your hopes are able To stand secure on earth, when earth it selfe's unstable? 3 Come dunghill worldlings; you, that root like swine, And cast up golden Trenches, where ye come; Whose onely pleasure is to undermine, And view the secrets of your mothers wombe; Come bring your Saint, pouch'd in his leather Shrine, And summon all your griping Angels home; Behold your world, the Bank of all your store; The world ye so admire; the world ye so adore. 4 A feeble world; whose hot-mouth'd pleasures tyre Before the Race; before the start, retrait; A faithlesse world, whose false delights expire Before the terme of half their promis'd Date; A fickle, world; not worth the least desire, Where ev'ry Change proclaimes a Change of State: A feeble, faithlesse, fickle world, wherein Each motion proves a vice, and ev'ry Act, a Sin. 5 The Beauty, that of late, was in her flowre; Is now a ruine, not to raise a Lust; He that was lately drench'd in Danaes showre Is Master, now, of neither Gold, nor Trust; Whose Honour, late, was mann'd with princely pow'r, His glory now lies buried in the dust; O who would trust this world, or prize what's in it, That gives and takes, and chops, and changes ev'ry minit! 6 Nor length of dayes, nor solid strength of Braine Can find a place wherein to rest secure; The world is various, and the Earth is vaine; There's nothing certaine here; there's nothing sure; We trudge, we travell but from paine to paine, And what's our onely griefe's our onely Cure: The World's a Torment; he that would endeaver To find the way to Rest, must seek the way to leave her. S. GREG. in ho. Behold, the world is withered in it self, yet flourishes in our hearts; every where, death; every where griefe; on every side fill'd with bitternesse, and yet with the blind mind of carnall desire we love her bitternesse; It flies, and we follow it; it fals, yet we sticke to it: And because we cannot enjoy it fallen, we fall with it: and enjoy it fallen.

Brave pastime, Readers, to consume that day, Which, without pastime, flyes too swift away! See how they labour; as if day and night Were both too short, to serve their loose delight; See how their curved bodies wreathe, and skrue Such antick shapes as Proteus never knew: One raps an oath; another deales a curse; Hee never better bould; this, never worse: One rubbes his itchlesse Elbow, shrugges, and laughs; The tother bends his beetle-browes, and chafes, Sometimes they whoope; sometimes their Stigian cries Send their Black-Santos to the blushing Skies; Thus, mingling Humors in a mad confusion, They make bad Premises, and worse Conclusion; But where's the Palme that Fortunes hand allowes To blesse the Victors honourable Browes? Come, Reader, come; Ile light thine eye the way To view the Prize, the while the Gamesters play; Close by the Jack, behold Gill Fortune stands To wave the game; See, in her partiall hands The glorious Garland's held in open show, To cheare the Ladds, and crowne the Conq'rers brow; The world's the Jack; The Gamsters that contend, Are Cupid, Mammon. That juditious Friend, That gives the ground, is Sathan; and the Boules Are sinfull Thoughts: The Prize, a Crowne for Fooles. Who breathes that boules not? what bold tongue can say Without a blush, he hath not bould to day? It is the Trade of man; And ev'ry Sinner Has plaid his Rubbers; Every Soule's a winner. The vulgar Proverb's crost: Hee hardly can Be a good Bouler and an Honest man.

Will earths perpetuall Progresse nere expire? Her Teame continuing in their fresh Careire, And yet they never rest, And yet they never tyre. 2 Sols hot-mouth'd Steeds, whose nostrils vomit flame, And brazen lungs belch forth quotidian fire, Their twelve houres taske perform'd, grow stiffe and lame, And their immortall Spirits faint and tyre: At th'Azure mountaines foote, their labours claime The priviledge of Rest, where they retyre To quench their burning Fetlocks, and to steepe Their flaming nostrils in the Westerne deepe, And fresh their tyred soules with strength-restoring sleepe. 3 But these prodigious Hackneyes, basely got Twixt Men and Devils, made for Race, nor Flight, Can dragge the idle world, expecting not The bed of Rest, but travill with delight; Who neither weighing way, nor weather, trott Through dust and dirt, and droyle both night and day; Thus droyle these feinds incarate, whose free paynes; Are fed with dropsies, and veneriall Blaines. No need to use the whip; but strength, to rule the raynes. 4 Poore Captive world! How has thy lightness given A just occasion to thy Foes illusion; O, how art thou betrayd, thus fayrely driven In seeming Triumph to thy owne confusion? How is thy empty universe bereiven Of all true Joyes, by one false Joyes delusion? So have T seene an unblowne virgin fed With sugard words so full, that shee is led A faire attended Bride, to a false Bankrupts Bed. 5 Pull gratious LORD; Let not thine Arme forsake The world, impounded in her owne devises; Thinke of that pleasure that thou once did take Amongst thy Lillies, and sweete Beds of spices: Hale strongly, thou whose hand has pow'r to slake The swift foot Fury of ten thousand Vices: Let not that dust-devouring Dragon boast, His craft has wonne, what Judahs Lyon lost; Remember what it crav'd; Recount the price it cost.

Ther's nothing wholsome, where the whole's infected: Unseise thy lips; Earths milk's a ripned Core That drops from her desease, that matters from her Sore. 4 Thinkst thou, that Paunch that burlyes out thy Coate, Is thriving Fat; or flesh, that seemes so brawny? Thy Paunch is dropsied, and thy Cheekes are bloat; Thy lips are white and thy complexion, tawny; Thy skin's a Bladder blowne with watry tumors: Thy flesh, a trembling Bogge, a Quagmire full of humors. 5 And thou, whose thrivelesse hands are ever strayning Earths fluent Brests, into an empty Sive, That alwaies hast, yet alwaies art complaining; And whin'st for more then earth has pow'r to give, Whose treasure flowes, and flees away as fast, That ever hast, and hast, yet hast not what thou hast. 6 Goe choose a Substance, foole, that will remaine Within the limits of thy leaking measure; Or else goe seeke an Urne that will retaine The liquid Body of thy slipp'ry Treasure: Alas, how poorely are thy labours crown'd? Thy liquors neither sweet, nor yet thy vessell sound. 7 What lesse then Foole is Man, to progge and plott, And lavish out the Creame of all his care, To gaine poore seeming goods, which, being got, Make firme possession, but a Thorowfare: Or if they stay, they furrow thoughts the deeper, And being kept with care, they loose their carefull keeper.

How backward! how praeposterous is the motion Of our ungaine devotion!

Wee sticke, or else retyre: A Lambe appeares a Lyon; and we feare, Each bush wee see's a Beare. When our dull soules direct their thoughts to Thee, The soft-pac'd Snayle is not so slow as wee: But when at earth wee dart our wing'd desire, We burne, we burne like fire: Like as the am'rous needle joyes to bend To her Magneticke Friend; Or as the greedy Lovers eye-balls flye At his faire Mistres eye, So, so we cling to earth; wee fly, and puff, Yet fly not fast enough; If Pleasure becken with her balmey hand, Her becke's a strong command; If Honour call us with her courtly breath, An hour's delay is death: If profits golden fingerd Charmes enveigle's, Wee clip more swift then Eagles. Let Auster weep, or blustring Boreas rore Till eyes or lungs be sore Let Neptune swell untill his dropsie sides Burst into broken Tides; Nor threatning Rockes, nor windes. nor waves, nor Fyre Can curbe our fierce desire; Nor Fire nor Rocks can stop our furious mindes, Nor waves, nor windes; How fast and fearlesse doe our footsteps flee!

O, will thy slumbring vengeance never wake, Till full-ag'd law-resisting Custome shake The pillours of thy Right, by false command? Unlocke thy Clouds, great Thund'rer, and come downe, Behold whose Temples weare thy sacred Crowne; Redresse, redresse our wrongs; revenge, revenge thy owne. 2 See, how the bold Usurper mounts the seat Of royall Majestie; How overstrawing Perils with pleasure, pointing ev'ry threat With bugbeare death; by torments over-awing Thy frighted subjects; or, by favours, drawing Their tempted hearts to his unjust retreat; Lord, canst thou be so mild? and hee so bold? Or can thy flockes be thriving, when the fold Is govern'd by a Fox? Lord, canst thou see and hold? 3 That swift-wing'd Advocate, that did commence Our welcome Suits before the King of Kings, That sweet Embassadour, that hurries hence What Ayres th'harmonious soule or sighs or sings, See how shee flutters her idle wings; Her wings are clipt and eyes put out by Sense: Sense-conq'ring Faith is now grown blind, and cold. And basely cravend, that, in times of old, Did conquer heav'n it selfe, do what th'Almighty could. 4 Behold, how double fraud does scourge and teare Atraeas wounded sides, plough'd up, and rent With knotted cords, whose fury has no eare; See how see stands a Pris'ner, to be sent A slave, into eternall banishment, I know not whither, O, I know not where: Her Patent must be cancel'd in disgrace; And sweet-lipt Fraud, with her divided face, Must act Astraeas part, must take Astraeas place. 5 Faiths pineons clipt? And faire Astraea gone? Quick-seeing Faith now blind? And Justice see? Has Justice now found wings? And has Faith none? What do wee here? who would not wish to bee Dissolv'd from earth; and, with Astraea, flee From this blind dungeon, to that Sunne-bright Throne? Lord, is thy Scepter lost, or laid aside? Is hell broke lose, and all her Friends untyed? Lord rise, and rowze, and rule; and crush their furious Pride. PETR. RAV. in Math. The Devill is the author of evill; the fountaine of wickednesse; the Adversary of the Truth; the corrupter of the world; mans perpetuall Enemy; Hee plants snares; digs ditches; spurres bodies; he goads soules; Hee suggests thoughts, belches Anger; exposes vertues to hatred; makes vices beloved; sowes Errours, nourishes contention; disturbes, and scatters Affections. MACAR. Let us suffer with those that suffer, and be crucified with those that are crucified, that wee may be glorified, with those that are glorified. SAVANAR. If there be no enemy, no fight; If no fight, no victory; if no victory, no crowne. EPIGRAM 15. [My Soule, sit thou a patient looker on] My Soule, sit thou a patient looker on; Judge not the Play before the Play be done: Her Plot has many Changes: Every Day Speakes a new Scene; The last Act crownes the Play. THE SECOND BOOKE. I. ISAIAH L. XI You that walke in the light of your owne fire, and in the sparkes that yee have kindled, yee shall lie downe in sorrow. 1 Doe silly Cupid snuffe, and trimme Thy false, thy feeble light, And make her selfe-consuming flames more bright; Mee thinke, shee burnes too dimme: Is this that sprightly fire, Whose more then sacred Beames inspire The ravisht hearts of men, and so inflame desire? 2 See, Boy, how thy unthrifty blaze Consumes; how fast shee waines; She spends her selfe, and her, whose wealth maintaines Her weake, her idle Rayes; Cannot thy lustfull blast, Which gave it luster, make it last? What heart can long be pleas'd, where pleasure spends so fast? 3 Goe, Wanton, place thy pale-fac'd light Where never breaking day Intends to visit mortals, or display Thy sullen shades of night: Thy Torch will burne more cleare In nights un-Titand Hemispheare; Heav'ns scornfull flames and thine can never co-appeare; 4 In vaine thy busie hands addresse Their labour, to display Thy easie blaze, within the veirge of days: The greater drownes the lesse: If heav'ns bright glory shine, Thy glimring sparks must needs resigne; Puffe out heav'ns glory then, or heav'n will worke out thine. 5 Goe, Cupids rammish Pander, goe, Whose dull, whose low desire Can find sufficient warmth from Natures fire, Spend borrow'd breath, and blow, Blow winde, made strong with spite; When thou hast pufft the greater light, Thy lesser sparke may shine, and warme the new made night; 6 Deluded mortals, tell mee, when Your daring breath has blowne Heav'ns Tapour out, and you have spent your owne, What fire shall warme yee then? Ah Fooles, perpetuall night Shall haunt your soules with Stigian fright, Where they shall broile in flames, but flames shall bring no light. S. AUGUST. The sufficiency of my merit is to know that my merit is not sufficient. S. GREG. Mor. 25. By how much the lesse, man sees himselfe, by so much the lesse hee displeases himselfe; And by how much the more hee sees the light of Grace, by so much the more hee disdaines the light of nature. S. GREG. Mor. The light of the understanding humilitie kindles and pride covers. EPIGRAM 1. [Thou blowst heav'ns fire, the whilst thou goest about] Thou blowst heav'ns fire, the whilst thou goest about, Rebellious foole, in vaine, to blow it out: Thy Folly addes confusion to thy death; Heav'ns fire confounds, when fann'd with Follies breath. II. ECCLESIASTES IV. VIII. There is no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches. O, How our wid'ned Armes over-stretch Their owne dimensions! How our hands can retch Beyond their distances! How our yeelding brest Can shrinke, to be more full, and full possest Of this inferiour Orbe! How earth refinde Can cling to sordid earth! How kinde to kinde! Wee gape, we graspe, we gripe; adde store to store; Enough requires too much; too much craves more; Wee charge our Soules so farre beyond our stint, That wee recoyle or burst; The busie Mint Of our laborious thoughts is ever going, And coyning new desires; desires, not knowing Where next to pitch; but, like the boundless Ocean Gaine, and gaine ground, and grow more strong by motion. The pale-fac'd Lady of the black-eyed night First tips her horned browes with easie light, Whose curious traine of spangled Nymphs attire Her next nights Glory with encreasing Fire; Each ev'ning addes more luster, and adornes The growing beautie of her grasping hornes; Shee suckes and drawes her brothers golden store Untill her glutted Orbe can sucke no more, Ev'n so the Vulture of insatiate mindes, Still wants, and wanting seekes; and seeking, findes New fuell to encrease her rav'nous fire, The grave is sooner cloyd then mans desire: Wee crosse the Seas, and midst her waves we burne, Transporting lifes, perchance that here returne: Wee sacke, wee ransacke to the utmost sands Of native kingdomes, and of forraine lands; Wee travill Sea, and Soyle; wee pry; wee proule, Wee progresse, and wee progge from pole to pole; Wee spend our mid-day sweat, our mid-night oyle; Wee tyre the night in thought; the day, in toyle; Wee make Art servill, and the Trade gentile, (Yet both corrupted with ingenious guile) To compasse earth; and with her empty store, To fill our Armes, and graspe one handfull more; Thus seeking Rest, our labours never cease, But as our yeares, our hot desires encrease; Thus wee poore little worlds (with blood and sweat) In vaine attempt to comprehend the great; Thus, in our gaine, become wee gainfull losers, And what's enclos'd, encloses the enclosers. Now, reader, close thy Booke, and then advise: Be wisely worldly; be not not wordlly wise; Let not thy nobler thoughts be alwaies raking The worlds base dunghill; Vermins took, by taking: Take heede thou trust not the deceitfull Lappe Of wanton Delilah; The world's a Trappe. HUGO de anima. Tell me where bee those now that so lately loved, and hugg'd the world? Nothing remaines of them but dust and wormes; Observe what those men were; what thoes men are: they were like thee; they did eate, drinke, laugh, and led merry dayes, and in a moment slipt into Hell; Here their flesh is food for wormes: There, their soules are fuell for fire, till they shall be rejoynd in an unhappy fellowship, and cast into eternall torments; where they that were once companions in sinne shall be hereafter partners in punishment. EPIGRAM 2. [Gripe, Cupid, and gripe still untill that wind] Gripe, Cupid, and gripe still untill that wind, That's pent before, find secret vent behind: And when th'ast done, hark here, I tell thee what, Before I'le trust thy Armefull I'le trust that. III. JOB XVIII. VIII. He is cast into a net by his owne feet, and walketh upon a snare. 1 What? Nets and Quiver too? what need there all These slie devices to betray poore men? Die they not fast enough, when thousands fall Before thy Dart? what need these Engins then? Attend they not, and answer to thy Call Like nightly Coveyes, where thou list? and when? What needs a Stratagem where strength can sway? Or what need strength compell, where none gainesay? Or what need stratagem or strength, where hearts obey? 2 Husband thy sleights: It is but vaine to wast Hony on those that will be catcht with Gall; Thou canst not, ah, thou canst not bid so fast As men obey; Thou art more slow to call, Than they to come: Thou canst not make such hast To strike; as they, being struck, make hast to fall; Go save thy Nets for that rebellious heart That scornes thy pow'r, and has obtain'd the Art T'avoid thy flying shaft, to quench thy fi'ry Dart 3 Lost mortall, how is thy destruction sure, Between two Bawds! and both without remorse; The one's a Line, the tother is a Lure; This, to entice thy soule; that, to enforce; Way-laid by both, how canst thou stand secure? That drawes; this woos thee to th'eternall curse; O charming Tyrant, how hast thou befool'd And slav'd poore man, that would not, if he could Avoid thy Line, thy Lure; nay, could not, if he would! 4 Alas, thy sweet perfidious voice betrayes His wanton cares with thy Syrenian baits; Thou wrapst his eyes in mists, then boldly layes Thy lethall Ginns before their Christall Gates; Thou lock'st up ev'ry Sense with thy false kayes, All willing Prisners to thy close deceits; His eare most nimble where it deafe should be, His Eye most blind where most it ought to see, And when his heart's most bound, then thinks it self most free. 5 Thou grand Imposter, how hast thou obtain'd The wardship of the world! Are all men turn'd Ideots, and Lunaticks? Are all retain'd Beneath thy servile bands? Is none return'd To his forgotten self? Has none regain'd His senses? Are their senses all adjourn'd? What none dismist thy Court? will no plump Fee Bribe thy false fists, to make a glad Decree, T'unfoole whom thou hast fool'd, and set thy prisners free? S. BERN. in Ser. In this world is much trecherie, little truth: here, all things are traps: here, every thing is beset with snares; here soules are endanger'd, bodies afflicted; Here all things are vanity, and vexation of spirit. EPIGRAM 3. [Nay, Cupid, pitch thy Trammill where thou please] Nay, Cupid, pitch thy Trammill where thou please, Thou canst not faile to take such fish as these; Thy thriving sport will nev'r be spent; no need To feare, when ev'ry Cork's a world; Thou'lt speed. IV. HOSEA CXIII. III. They shalbe as the chaffe that is driven with a whirlewind out of the floore, and as the smoke out of the chimney. Flint-brested Stoicks, you whose marble eyes Contemne a wrinckle, and whose soules despise To follow Natures too affected Fashion, Or travell in the Regent walk of Passion; Whose rigid hearts disdaine to shrinke at Feares, Or play at fast and loose with Smiles and Teares; Come burst your spleenes with laughter; to behold A new-found vanity; which, dayes of old Nev'r knew; A vanity, that has beset The world, and made more slaves than Mahomet; That has condemn'd us to the servile yoke Of slavery, and made us slaves to smoke: But stay! why taxe I thus our moderne times, For new-blowne Follies, and for new-borne Crimes? Are we sole guilty, and the first Age free? No, they were smoak'd, and slav'd as well as we: What's sweet-lipt Honours blast, but smoke? What's treasure; But very smoke? And what more smoke than pleasure? Alas! they'r all but shadowes, Fumes, and blasts; That vanishes; this fades: the other waits: The restlesse Merchant; he, that loves to steepe His braines in wealth, and layes his soule to sleepe In bags of Bullion, sees th'immortall Crowne, And faine would mount, but Ingots keep him downe: He brags to day, perchance, and begs tomorrow; He lent but now; wants Credit, now, to borrow: Blow wind? the Treasure's gone; the Merchant's broke; A slave to silver's but a slave to smoke: Behold the Glory-vying Child of Fame, That from deep wounds sucks forth an honour'd name, That thinks no purchase worth the stile of good, But what is sold for sweat, and seal'd with blood, That's for a Poynt, a blast of empty breath, Undaunted, gazes in the face of death; Whose deare-bought Bubble, fild with vaine renowne, Breaks with a Phillip, or a Gen'rals frowne; His stroke-got Honour staggers with a stroke; A Slave to Honour is a Slave to Smoke: And that fond soule which wasts his idle dayes In loose delights, and sports about the Blaze Of Cupids Candle; he that daily spies 'Twin Babies in his Mistresse Geminies, Where to his sad devotion does impart The sweet burnt offring of a bleeding heart; See, how his wings are sing'd in Cyprian fire, Whose flames consume with youth; in Age, expire: The world's a Bubble; all the pleasures in it, Like morning vapours vanish in a minit: The vapours vanish, and the Bubble's broke; A slave to Pleasure is a slave to smoke. Now, Stoick, cease thy laughter, and repast Thy pickled cheeks with Teares, and weep as fast. S. HIEROM. That rich man is great, who thinkes not himselfe great because he is rich: the proud man (who is the poore man) brags outwardly, but begs inwardly: He is blowne up, but not full. PETR. RAV. Vexation and anguish accompany riches and honour: The pompe of the world and the favour of the people are but smoake, and a blast suddenly vanishing: which, if they commonly please, commonly bring repentance, and for a minut of joy they bring an age of sorrow. EPIGRAM 4. [Cupid; thy diet's strange; It dulls; It rowzes] Cupid; thy diet's strange; It dulls; It rowzes; It cooles; it heats; it binds, and then it looses: Dull-sprightly-cold-hot Foole, if ev'r it winds thee Into loosenesse once, take heed; It binds thee. V. PROVERBS XXIII. V. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches make themselves wings, they flie away as an Eagle. 1 False world, thou ly'st: Thou canst not lend The least delight: Thy favours cannot gaine a Friend, They are so sleight: Thy morning pleasure makes an end To please at night: Poore are the wants that thou supply'st, And yet thou vaunt'st, and yet thou vy'st With heav'n; Fond earth thou boasts; False world thou ly'st. 2 Thy babbling Tongue tels golden Tales Of endlesse Treasure; Thy bounty offers easie sales Of lasting Pleasure; Thou asks thy Consciencce what she ayles, And swear to ease her; There's none can want where thou supply'st; There's none can give where thou deny'st: Alas, fond world thou boasts; false world thou ly'st. 3 What well advised eare regards What earth can say? Thy worlds are Gold, but thy rewards Are painted Clay; Thy cunning can but pack the Cards: Thou canst not play: Thy game at weakest, still thou vy'st; If seen, and then revy'd, deny'st; Thou art not what thou seem'st: False world thou ly'st. 4 Thy tinsill boosome seems a Mint Of new-coynd treasure; A Paradise, that has no stint, No change, no measure; A painted Cask, but nothing in't Nor wealth nor pleasure: Vaine earth! that falsly thus comply'st With man; Vaine man! that thus rely'st On earth: Vaine man thou dot'st: Vaine earth thou ly'st. 5 What meane dull soules, in this high measure To haberdash In earths base wares, whose greatest treasure Is drosse and trash? The height of whose enchaunting pleasure Is but a Flash? Are these the Goods that thou supply'st Us mortals with? Are these the high'st Can these bring cordiall peace? False world thou ly'st. PET. BLES. This world is deceitfull; Her end is doubtfull; Her conclusion is horrible; Her Judge is terrible; And her punishment is intolerable. S. AUGUST. lib. Confess. The vaine glory of this world is a deceitfull sweetnesse, a fruitlesse labour, a perpetuall care, a dangerous honour; Her beginning is without providence, and her end not without repentance. EPIGRAM 5. [World; th'art a Traitor; Thou hast stampt thy base] World; th'art a Traitor; Thou hast stampt thy base And Chymick metall with great Caesars face; And with thy bastard Bullion thou hast barterd For wares of price; How justly drawne, and quarterd! VI. JOB XV. XXXI. Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity, for vanity shalbe his recompence. 1 Believe her not: Her Glasse diffuses False Portraitures: Thou canst espie No true reflection: She abuses Her mis-inform'd beholders eye; Her Chrystal's falsely steel'd: It scatters Deceitfull beames; Believe her not: She flatters. 2 This flaring Mirrour represents No right Proportion, hiew, nor Feature: Her very looks are Complements; They make thee fairer, goodlier, greater; The skilfull Glosse of her reflection But paints the Context of thy course Complexion. 3 Were thy dimension but a stride, Nay, wert thou statur'd but a span, Such as the long-bill'd Troopes defi'd, A very Fragment of a Man; Shee'l make thee Mimas, which ye will The Jove-slaine Tyrant, or th'Ionick Hill: 4 Had surfeits, or th'ungratious Starre Conspir'd to make one Common place Of all deformities, that are Within the Volume of thy face, Shee'd lend thee favour, should out-move The Troy-bane Hellen, or the Queene of Love. 5 Were thy consum'd estate as poore As Lazars, or afflicted Jobs, Shee'l change thy wants to seeming store, And turne thy Raggs to purple Robes: Shee'l make thy hide-bound flanck appeare As plump as theirs that feast it all the yeare. 6 Looke off; let not thy Opticks be Abus'd; thou see'st not what thou shouldst; Thy selfe's the Object thou should'st see, But 'tis thy shadow thou behold'st: And shadowes thrive the more in stature, The nearer we approach the light of nature. 7 Where heav'ns bright beames look more direct, The shadow shrinks as they grow stronger; But when they glaunce their faire aspect, The bold-fac'd shade growes larger, longer; And when their lamp begins to fall, Th'increasing shadowes lengthen most of all. 8 The soule that seeks the noone of Grace, Shrinks in; but swels, if Grace retreat; As heav'n lifts up, or veiles his Face, Our self-esteemes grow lesse, or great; The least is greatest; And who shall Appear the greatest, are the least of all. HUGO lib.3 de anima. It vaine he lifts the eye of his heart to behold his God, who is not first rightly advised to behold himselfe: First thou must see the visible things of thyself, before thou canst be prepared to know the invisible things of God, for if thou canst not apprehend the things within thee, thou canst not comprehend the things above thee: The best looking glasse wherein to see thy God, is perfectly to see thyselfe. EPIGRAM 6. [Be not deceiv'd, great Foole; There is no losse] Be not deceiv'd, great Foole; There is no losse In being small. Great bulks but swell with drosse: Man is heav'ns Master-peece; If it appeare More great, the valu's lesse; If lesse, more deare. VII. DEUTERONOMY XXXX. XIX. I have set before thee life and death, blessing and cursing, therefore choose life, that thou and thy seed may live. 1 The world's a Floore, whose swelling heapes retaine The mingled wages of the Ploughmans toyle; The world's a Heape, whose yet unwinnowed graine Is lodg'd with chaffe and buried in her soyle; All things are mixt; the usefull with the vaine; The good with bad; the noble with the vile; The world's an Ark, wherein things pure and grosse Present their lossefull gaine, and gainfull losse, Where ev'ry dram of Gold containes a pound of drosse. 2 This furnisht Ark presents the greedy view With all that earth can give, or heav'n can add; Here, lasting joyes; here, pleasures hourely new, And hourely fading, may be wisht and had: All points of Honour; counterfeit and true Salute thy soule, and wealth both good and bad: Here maist thou open wide the two-leav'd doore Of all thy wishes, to receive that store Which being emptied most; does overflow the more. 3 Come then, my soule, approach this royall Burse, And see what wares our great Exchange retaines; Come, come; here's that shall make a firme divorse Betwixt thy Wants and thee, if want complaines; No need to sit in councell with thy purse, Here's nothing, good, shall cost more price than paines; But O my soule, take heed; If thou relie Upon thy faithlesse Opticks, thou wilt buy Too blind a bargaine: know; Fooles onely trade by th'Eye. 4 The worldly wisdome of the foolish man Is like a Sive, that does, alone, retaine The grosser substance of the worthlesse Bran; But thou, my soule, let thy brave thoughts disdaine So course a purchace; O, be thou a Fan To purge the Chaffe, and keep the winnow'd Graine; Make cleane thy thoughts, and dresse thy mixt desires; Thou art heav'ns Tasker; and thy GOD requires The purest of thy Floore, as well as of thy fires. 5 Let Grace conduct thee to the paths of peace, And wisdome blesse thy soule's unblemisht wayes, No matter, then, how short or long's the Lease, Whose date determins thy selfe-numbred dayes; No need to care for wealths or Fames increase, Nor Mars his Palme, nor high Apollos Bayes: LORD, If thy gracious bounty please to fill The floore of my desires, and teach me skill To dresse and chuse the Corn, take those the Chaffe that will. S. AUGUST. lib. 1 de doct. Christi Temporall things more ravish in the expectation, than in fruition: but things eternall more in the fruition than expectation. Ibid. The life of man is the middle betweene Angels and beasts: If man takes pleasure in carnall things, he is compared to beasts; But if he delights in spirituall things, he is suited with Angels. EPIGRAM 7. [Art thou a Child? Thou wilt not then be fed] Art thou a Child? Thou wilt not then be fed, But like a Child, and with the Childrens bread: But thou art fed with the chaffe, or corne undrest: My soule thou favour'st too much of the Beast. VIII. PHILIPPIANS III. XIX. They minde earthly things, but our conversation is in heaven. Venus. Divine Cupid. Venus: What meanes this peevish Brat? Whish, Lullaby; What ailes my Babe? What ayles my Babe to cry? Will nothing still it? Will it neither be Pleas'd with the Nurses brest nor Mothers knee? What ayles my Bird? What moves my froward Boy To make such whimpring faces? Peace, my Joy: Will nothing doe? Come, come, this pettish Brat, Thus cry and bawle, and cannot tell for what? Come busse and friends, my lambe; whish, lullaby; What ayles my Babe? What ayles my Babe to cry? Peace, peace my deare; alas, thy early yeares Had never faults to merit halfe these teares: Come smile upon me: Let thy mother spie Thy Fathers Image in her Babies eye: Husband these guiltlesse drops against the rage Of harder fortunes, and the gripes of Age; Thine eye's not ripe for teares: whish, lullaby; What ayles my Babe, mine sweet-fac'd Babe to cry? Look, look, what's here! A dainty Golden thing: See how the dauncing Bells turn round and ring To please my Bantling! Here's a knack will breed A hundred kisses: Here's a knack indeed! So, now my bird is white, and looks as faire As Pelops shoulder, or my milk white payre: Here's right the Fathers smile, when Mars beguil'd Sick Venus of her heart, just thus he smil'd. Divine Cupid: Well may they smile alike: Thy base-bred Boy And his base Syre had both one Cause; A Boy: How well their subjects and their smiles agree? Thy Cupid finds a Toy, and Mars found thee: False Queene of Beauty, Queene of false delights, Thy knee presents an Embleme, that invites Man to himselfe, whose selfe-transported heart (Ov'rwhelm'd with native sorrowes, and the smart Of purchas'd griefes) lies whining night and day, Not knowing why, till heavy-heeld delay The dull-brow'd Pander of despaire, layes by His leaden Buskins, and presents his eye With antick Trifles, which th'indulgent earth Makes proper Objects of man's childish mirth: These be the coyne that passe; the sweets that please; There's nothing good, there's nothing great but these: These be the Pipes that base-borne minds daunce after, And turne immod'rate teares to lavish laughter; Whilst heav'nly Raptures passe without regard; Their Strings are harsh, and their high straines unheard: The ploughmans Whistle, or the triviall Flute Find more respect than great Apollo's Lute: Wee'l look to heav'n, and trust to higher Joyes; Let Swine love Husks, and children whine for Toyes. S. BERN. That is the true and chiefe joy, which is not conceived from the creature, but received from its Creator; which (being once possest therof) none can take from thee, whereto all pleasure being compared, is torment; all joy is griefe: sweet things are bitter, all glory is basenesse, and all delectable things are despicable. S. BERN. Joy in a changeable subject must necessarily change as the subject changes. EPIGRAM 8. [Peace, childish Cupid, peace: Thy finger'd eye] Peace, childish Cupid, peace: Thy finger'd eye But cries for what, in time, will make thee cry: But are peevish wranglings thus appeas'd? Well mayst thou cry, that art so poorely pleas'd IX. ISAIAH X. III. What will ye do in the day of your visitation? to whom will ye flie for help, and where will ye leave your glory? 1 Is this that jolly God, whose Cyprian Bow Has shot so many flaming darts, And made so many wounded Beauties goe Sadly perplext with whimpring hearts? Is this that Sov'raigne Deity that brings The slavish world in awe, and stings The blundring sould of swains, and stoops the hearts of kings. 2 What Circean Charme? what Hecatean spight Has thus abus'd the God of love? Great Jove was vanquisht by his greater might; (And who is stronger-arm'd than Jove?) Or has our lustfull God perfom'd a Rape, And (fearing Argus eyes) would scape The view of jealous earth, in this prodigious shape? 3 Where be those Rosie Cheeks, that lately scorn'd The malice of injurious Fates? Ah, where's that pearle Percullis, that adorn'd Those dainty two-leav'd Ruby gates? Where be those killing eyes, that so controld The world? And locks, that did infold Like knots of flaming wyre, like Curles of burnisht Gold? 4 No, no: 'Twas neither Hecatean spite Nor Charme below, nor pow'r above; 'Twas neither Circes spell, nor Stygian sprite, That thus transform'd our God of Love; 'Twas owle-ey'd Lust (more potent far than they) Whose eyes and actions hate the day; Whom all the world observe; whom all the world obay. 5 See how the latter Trumpets dreadfull blast Affrights stout Mars his trembling Son! See, how he startles! how he stands agast, And scrambles from his melting Throne! Hark, how the direfull hand of vengeance teares The sweltring Clouds, whilst heav'n appeares A Circle fil'd with flame, and centerd with his feares. 6 This is that day, whose oft report hath worne Neglected Tongues of Prophets bare; The faithlesse subject of the worldlings scorne, The summe of men and Angels pray'r: This, this the day whose All-descerning light Ransacks the secret dens of night, And severs Good from Bad, true Joyes from false Delight. 7 You grov'ling Worldlings, you whose wisdome trades, Where light nev'r shot his Golden Ray; That hide your Actions in Cymerian shades, How will your eyes indure this day? Hils wilbe deafe, and mountaines will not heare; There be no Caves, no Corners there, To shade your souls from fire, to shield your hearts from feare. HUGO. O the extreame loathsomnesse of fleshly lust, which not onely effeminates the mind, but enerves the body; which not onely distaines the soule, but disguises the person! It is usher'd with fury and wantonnesse. It is accompanied with filthinesse and uncleannesse, and it is followed with griefe and repentance. EPIGRAM 9. [What? sweet-fac'd Cupid, has thy bastard-treasure] What? sweet-fac'd Cupid, has thy bastard-treasure, Thy boasted Honours, and thy bold-fac'd pleasure Perplext thee now? I told thee long ago, To what they'd bring thee, foole, To wit, to woe. X. NAHUM II. X. Shee is emptie, and void, and waste. 1 Shee's empty: Hark, she sounds: There's nothing there, But noise to fill thy eare; Thy vaine enquiry can, at length, but find A blast of mumr'ing wind: It is a Cask, that seems as full, as faire; But meerely tunn'd with Ayre: Fond youth, go build thy hopes on better grounds: The soule that vainly founds Her Joyes upon this world, but feeds on empty sounds: 2 Shee's empty: Hark; she sounds: There's nothing in't: The spark-ingendring Flint Shall sooner melt, and hardest Raunce shall, first, Dissolve and quench thy thirst, Ere this false world shall still thy stormy brest With smooth-fac'd Calmes of Rest: Thou mayst, as well, expect Meridian light From shades of black-mouth'd night, As in this empty world to find a full delight. 3 Shee's empty: Hark; she sounds; 'Tis void and vast; What if some flattring blast Of flatuous Honour should perchance, be there; And whisper in thine eare, It is but wind; and blowes but where it list, And vanishes like a Mist: Poore Honour earth can give! What gen'rous mind Would be so base, to bind Her heav'n-bred soule a slave, to serve a Blast of wind? 4 Shee's empty: Hark; She sounds: 'Tis but a Ball For Fooles to play withall; The painted filme but of a stronger Bubble, That's lin'd with silken trouble; It is a world, whose Work, and Recreation Is vanity, and vexation; A Hagg, repair'd with vice-complexion, paint: A Questhouse of complaint; It is Saint; a Fiend: worse Fiend, when most a Saint. 5 Shee's empty: Hark: she sounds: 'Tis vaine and void What's here to be enjoy'd, But Griefe, and sicknesse, and large bills of sorrow, Drawne now, and crost to morrow? Or what are Men, but puffs of dying breath, Reviv'd with living death? Fond lad; O build thy hopes on surer grounds Than what dull flesh propounds; Trust not this hollw world, shee's empty: Hark; she sounds. S. CHRYS. in Ep. ad Heb. Contemne riches, and thou shalt be rich; Contemne glory, and thou shalt be glorious; Contemne injuries, and thou shalt be a conqueror; Contmne rest, and thou shalt gaine rest; Contemne earth, and thou shalt find Heaven. HUGO lib. de Vanit. mundi. The world is a vanity which affords neither beauty to the amorous, nor reward to the laborious, nor encouragement to the industrious. EPIGRAM 10. [This House is to be let; for life or yeares] This House is to be let; for life or yeares; Her Rent is sorrow, and her In-come, Teares: Cupid, 't'as long stood void: Her bills make knowne, She must be dearely Let; or let alone. XI. MATTHEW VII. XIV. Narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Prepost'rous foole, thou troul'st amisse: Thou err'st; That's not the way, 'Tis this; Thy hopes instructed by thine Eye, Make thee appeare more neare than I; My floore is not so flat, so fine, And has more obvious Rubs than thine; 'Tis true; my way is hard, and strait, And leads me through a thorny Gate; Whose ranckling pricks are sharp, and fell; The common way to heav'n's by Hell: 'Tis true; Thy path is short and faire, And free of Rubbs. Ah, foole, beware, The safest Road's not alwayes ev'n; The way to Hell's a seeming Heav'n; Think'st thou, the Crowne of Glory's had With idle ease, fond Cyprian Lad? Think'st thou, that mirth, and vaine delights, High feed, and shadow-shortning nights, Soft knees, full bones, and Beds of Downe Are proper Prologues to a Crowne? Or canst thou hope to come, and view, Like prosperous Caesar, and subdue? The bond-slave Usurer will trudge In spite of Gouts, will turne a drudge, And serve his soule-condemning purse, T'increase it with the widowes Curse; And shall the Crowne of glory stand Not worth the waving of a hand? The fleshly wanton, to obtaine His minit-lust, will count it gaine To lose his freedome, his Estate Upon so deare, so sweet a rate; Shall pleasures thus be priz'd, and must Heav'ns Palme be cheaper than a lust? The true-bred Spark, to hoyse his name Upon the waxen wings of Fame, Will fight, undaunted, in a Flood That's rais'd with brackish drops, and blood: And shall the promis'd Crowne of life Be thought a Toy, not worth a Strife? And easie Good brings easie Gaines, But things of price are bought with paines: The pleasing way is not the right: He that would conquer heav'n, must fight. S. HIEROM. in Ep. No labour is hard, no time is long, wherein the glory of Eternity is the mark we levell at. S. GREG. lib.8. Mor. The valour of a just man is to conquer the flesh, to contradict his owne will, to quench the delights of this present life, to indure and love the miseries of this world for the reward of a better, to contmne the flatteries of prosperiy, and inwardly to overcome the feares of adversity. EPIGRAM 11. [O Cupid, if thy smoother way were right] O Cupid, if thy smoother way were right, I should mistrust this Crowne were counterfeit: The way's not easie where the Prize is great: I hope no virtues, where I smell no sweat. XII. GALATIANS VI. XIV. God forbid that I should glory, save in the Crosse. 1 Can nothing settle my uncertaine brest And fix my rambling Love? Can my Affections find out nothing best? But still, and still remove? Has earth no mercy? Will no Ark of Rest Receive my restlesse Dove? Is there no Good, than which there's nothing higher, To blesse my full desire With Joyes that never change; with Joyes that nev'r expire? 2 I wanted wealth; and, at my deare request, Earth lent a quick supply; I wanted Mirth, to charme my sullen brest; And who more brisk than I? I wanted Fame, to glorifie the rest; My Fame flew Eagle high: My Joy not fully ripe, but all decaid; Wealth vanisht like a shade; My mirth began to flag, my Fame began to fade. 3 The world's an Ocean, hurried to and fro, With ev'ry blast of passion: Her lustfull streames, when either ebb or flow, Are tides of mans vexation: They alter daily, and they daily grow The worse by alteration; The Earth's a Cask full tun'd, yet wanting measure; Her precious wine, is pleasure; Her Yest is Honours puffe; Her Lees are worldly treasure. 4 My trust is in the Crosse: Let Beauty flag Her loose, her wanton saile; Let count'nance-gilding Honour cease to brag In courtly termes, and vale; Let ditch-bred wealth, henceforth, forget to wag Her base, though golden taile; False beauties conquest is but reall losse, And wealth but golden drosse; Best Honour's but a blast: my trust is in the Crosse. 5 My trust is in the Crosse: There lies my rest; My fast, my sole delight; Let cold-mouth'd Boreas, or the hot-mouth'd East Blow till they burst with spight; Let earth and hell conspire their worst, their best, And joyne their twisted might: Let showres of Thunderbolts dart down, and wound me, And troupes of Fiends surround me, All this may well confront; all this shall nev'r confound me. S. AUGUST. Christs Crosse is the Chriscrosse of all our happinesse; It delivers us from blindnesse of errour, and enriches our darknesse with light; It restores the troubled soule to rest; It brings strangers to Gods Acquaintance; It makes remote forreiners neare neighbours; It cuts off discord; concludes a league of everlasting peace, and is the bounteous Author of all Good. S. BERN. in Ser. de resur. We find glory in the Crosse; To us that are saved it is the power of God, and the fulnesse of all vertues. EPIGRAM 12. [I follow'd Rest, Rest fled, and soone forsooke me] I follow'd Rest, Rest fled, and soone forsooke me; I ran from Griefe, Griefe ran, and over-tooke me. What shall I doe? Lest I be too much tost On worldly Crosses, LORD, let me be crost. XIII. PROVERBS XXVI. XI. As a Dog returneth to his vomit, so a foole returneth to his follie. O I am wounded! And my wounds do smart Beyond my patience, or great Chirons Art; I yeeld, I yeeld; The day, the Palme is thine; Thy Bow's more true; thy shafts more fierce than mine; Hold, hold, O hold thy conqu'ring hand. What need To send more darts; The first has done the deed: Oft have we struggled, when our equall Armes Shot equall shafts; inflicted equall harmes; But this exceeds, and with her flaming head, Twyfork'd with death, has struck my Conscience dead; But must I die? Ah me! If that were all, Then, then I'd stroke my bleeding wounds and call This dart a Cordiall; and with joy, endure These harsh Ingredients, where my Griefe's my Cure. But something whispers in my dying eare, There is an After-day; which day I feare: The slender debt to Nature's quickly payd, Discharg'd, perchance, with greater ease than made; But if that pale-fac'd Sergeant make Arrest, Ten thousand Actions would (whereof the least Is more than all this lower world can bayle) Be entred, and condemne me to the Jayle Of Stygian darknesse, bound in red-hot Chaines, And grip'd with Tortures worse than Tytian paines: Farewell my vaine, farewell my loose delights; Farewell my rambling dayes; my rev'ling nights; 'Twas you betraid me first, and when ye found My soule at vantage, gave my soule the wound: Farewell my Bullion Gods, whose sov'raigne lookes So often catch'd me with their golden hookes, Go, seek another slave; ye must all go; I cannot serve my God, and Bullion too: Farewell false Honour; you, whose ayry wings Did mount my soule above the Thrones of kings; Then flattr'd me; tooke pet; and, in disdaine, Nipt my greene Buds; then kickt me down againe: Farewell my Bow: Farewell my Cyprian Quiver; Farwell, deare world; farewell, deare world, for ever. O, but this most delicious world, how sweet Her pleasures relish! Ah! How jump they meet The grasping soule! And, with their sprightly fire, Revive, and raise, and rowze the rapt desire! For ever? O, to part so long? What never Meet more? Another yeare; and then, for ever: Too quick resolves do resolution wrong; What part so soone, to be divorc'd so long? Things to be done are long to be debated; Heav'n is not day'd: Repentance is not dated. S. AUGUST. lib. de util. agen. paen. Go up my soule into the Tribunall of thy Conscience; There set thy guilty selfe before thy selfe: Hide not thy selfe behind thy selfe, least God bring thee forth before thy selfe. S. AUGUST. in Soliloq. In vaine is that washing, where the next sin defiles: He hath ill repented whose sinnes are repeated: That stomack is the worse for vomiting, that licks up his vomit. ANSELM. God hath promised pardon to him that repenteth, but he hath not promised repentance to him that sinneth. EPIGRAM 13. [Braine-wounded Cupid, had this hasty dart] Braine-wounded Cupid, had this hasty dart As it hath prickt thy Fancy, pierc'd thy heart, 'T had been thy Friend: O how has it deceiv'd thee? For had this dart but kill'd, this dart had sav'd thee. XIV. PROVERBS XXIV. XVI. A just man falleth seven times and riseth up againe; but the wicked shall fall into mischiefe. 1 'Tis but a Foyle at best; And that's the most Your skill can boast: My slippry footing fail'd me; and you tript, Just as I slipt: My wanton weaknesse did her selfe betray With too much play: I was too bold: He never yet stood sure, That stands secure: Who ever trusted to his native strength, But fell at length? The Title's craz'd, the Tenour is not good, That claimes by th'evidence of flesh and Blood. 2 Boast not thy skill; The Righteous man fals oft, Yet fals but soft: There may be dirt to mire him; but, no stones, To crush his bones: What, if he staggers? Nay, put case he be Foyl'd on his knee; That very knee will bend to heav'n, and woo For mercy too. The true-bred Gamster ups a fresh; and then, Falls to't agen; Whereas the leaden-hearted Coward lies, And yeelds his conquer'd life; or cravend dies. 3 Boast not thy Conquest; thou, that ev'ry houre, Fals ten times lower; Nay, hast not pow'r to rise, if not, in case, To fall more base: Thou wallow'st where I slip; and thou dost tumble, Where I did but stumble: Thou glory'st in thy slav'ries dirty Badges, And fal'st for wages: Sowre griefe, and sad repentance scowres and cleares My staines with teares; Thy falling keeps thy falling still in ure; But when I slip, I stand the more secure. 4 LORD what a nothing is this little Span, We call a Man! What fenny trash maintaines the smooth'ring fires Of his desires! How sleight and short are his Resolves at longest! How weake, at strongest! O if a Sinner, held by thy fast hand Can hardly stand, Good GOD! in what a desp'rate case are they That have no stay! Mans state implies a necessary Curse; When not himselfe, hee's mad; when most himself, hee's worse. S. AMBROS. in Serm. ad vincula. Peter stood more firmely after he had lamented his fall, than before he fell: Insomuch that he found more grace than he lost grace. S. CHRYS. in Ep. ad Heliod. monach. It is no such heinous matter to fall, afflicted; as, being downe, to lie dejected: It is no danger for a souldier to receive a wound in battell; but after the wound received, through despaire of recovery, to refuse a Remedy; For we often see wounded Champions weare the Palme at last, and after flight, crown'd with victory. EPIGRAM 14 [Triumph not, Cupid, His mischance does show] Triumph not, Cupid, His mischance does show Thy Trade; does once, what thou dost alwayes do: Brag not too soone: Has thy prevailing hand Foyl'd him? Ah, Foole, Th'ast taught him how to stand. XV. JEREMIAH XXXII. XL. I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. So; now the soule's sublim'd: Her sowre desires Are re-calcin'd in heav'ns well tempred Fires: The heart restor'd and purg'd from drossie Nature, Now finds the freedome of a new-borne Creature: It lives another life, it breathes new Breath; It neither feeless nor feares the sting of death: Like as the idle vagrant (having none) That boldly dopts each house he views, his owne: Makes ev'ry purse his Checquer; and, at pleasure, Walks forth, and taxes all the world, like Caesar, At length, by virtue of a just Command, His sides are lent to a severer hand; Whereon, his Passe, not fully understood, Is texted in a Manuscript of Blood; Thus past from towne to towne, untill he come A sore Repentant to his native home: Ev'n so the rambling heart, that idly roves From Crime to Sin; and, uncontrol'd, removes From lust to lust, when wanton flesh invites From old-worne pleasures to new choice delights, At length corrected by the filiall Rod Of his offended (but his gracious GOD) And lasht from Sinnes to sighs; and, by degrees, From sighs to vowes; From vowes, to bended knees, From bended knees, to a true pensive brest From thence, to torments, not by tongues exprest, Returnes, and (from his sinfull selfe exil'd) Finds a glad Father; He, a welcome Child: O, then, it lives; O then, it lives involv'd In secret Raptures; pants to be dissolv'd: The royall Of-spring of a second Birth Sets ope to heav'n, and shuts the doores to earth If love-sick Jove-commanded Clouds should hap To raine such show'rs as quickned Danaes lap: Or dogs (far kinder than their purple Master) Should lick his sores, he laughs nor weeps the faster. If Earth (Heav'ns Rivall) dart her idle Ray; To heav'n, 'tis Wax, and to the world, 'tis Clay: If earth present delights, it scornes to draw, But, like the Jet unrub'd, disdaines that straw: No hope deceives it, and no doubt divides it; No Griefe disturbes it; and no Errour guides it; No Guilt condemnes it; and no Folly shames it; No sloth besotts it; and no lust inthrals it; No Scorne afflicts it; and no Passion gawles it: It is a Carknet of immortall life; An Arke of peace; The Lifts of sacred Strife; A purer Peece of endlesse Transitory; A Shrine of Grace; A little Throne of Glory; A heav'n-borne Of-spring of a new-borne birth; An earthly Heav'n; An ounce of heav'nly Earth. S. AUGUST. de spir. &amp; anima. O happy heart, where piety affects; where, humility subject; where, repentance corrects; where, obedience directs; where, perseverance perfects; where, power protects; where, devotion projects; where, charity connects. S. GREG. Which way soever the heart turnes it self (if carefully) it shall commonly observe, that in those very things we lose God, in those very things we shall find God; It shall find the heat of his power in consideration of those things, in the love of which things he was most cold; and by what things it fell, perverted, by those things it is raised, converted. EPIGRAM 15. [My heart, but wherefore do I call thee so?] My heart, but wherefore do I call thee so? I have renounc'd my Interest long ago; When thou wert false, and fleshly, I was thine; Mine wert thou never, till thou wert not mine. THE THIRD BOOKE. The Entertainment. All you whose better thoughts are newly born, And (rebaptiz'd with holy fire) can scorn The worlds base Trash; whose necks disdain to bear Th'imperious yoke of Sathan; whose chast eare No wanton Songs of Syrens can surprize With false delight; whose more than Eagle-eyes Can view the glorious flames of Gold, and gaze On glittring beames of Honour, and not daze, Whose souls can spurne at pleasure, and deny The loose Suggestions of the Flesh; draw nigh: And you, whose am'rous, whose select desires Would feele the warmth of those transcendant fires, Which (like the rising Sun) put out the light Of Venus starre, and turne her day to night; You that would love, and have your passions crown'd With greater happinesse than can be found In your own wishes; you, that would affect Where neither scorne, nor guile, nor disrespect Shall wound your tortur'd Soules; that would enjoy, Where neither want can pinch, nor fulnesse cloy; Nor double doubt afflicts, nor baser Feare Unflames your courage in pursuit; draw neare: Shake hands with earth, and let your soule respect Her Joyes no further than her Joyes reflect Upon her Makers Glory, if thou swim In wealth, See him in all, See all in Him: Sink'st thou in want, and is thy small Cruise spent? See Him in want; Enjoy Him in Content: Conceiv'st Him lodg'd in Crosse, or lost in paine? In Pray'r and Patience find Him out againe: Make Heav'n thy Mistresse, Let no Change remove Thy loyall heart: Be fond; be sick of Love: What if he stops his eare, or knit his Brow? At length hee'l be as fond, as sick as thou: Dart up thy Soule in Groanes: Thy secret Grone Shall pierce his Eare, shall pierce his Eare, alone: Dart up thy Soule in vowes; Thy sacred Vow Shall find him out, where heav'n alone shall know: Dart up thy soule in sighs: Thy whispring sigh Shall rouze his eares, and feare no listner nigh: Send up thy Grones, thy Sighs, thy closet Vow; There's none, there's none shall know but Heav'n and thou: Grones fresht with vowes, and vowes made salt with tears, Unscale his eyes, amd seale his conquer'd eares: Shoot up the bosome Shafts of thy desire, Feather'd with Faith, and double forkt with Fire, And they will hit; Feare not, where heav'n bids Come: Heav'ns never deafe, but when mans heart is dumb I. ISIAH XXIX. VI. My soule hath desired thee in the night. Good God! what horrid darknesse do's surround My groping soule! How are my Senses bound In utter shades; and, muffled from the light, Lusk in the bosome of eternall night! The bold-fac'd Lamp of heav'n can set and rise; And, with his morning glory, fill the eyes Of gazing Mortals; his victorious Ray Can chase the shadowes, and restore the day: Nights bashfull Empresse, though she often wayne; As oft repents her darknesse; primes againe; And with her circling Hornes does re-embrace Her brothers wealth, and orbs her silver face. But, ah, my Sun, deep swallow'd in his Fall, Is set, and cannot shine, not rise at all. My bankerupt Waine can beg nor borrow light: Alas, my darknesse is perpetuall night. Fals have their Risings; Wanings have their Primes, And desp'rate sorrowes wait their better times, Ebbs have their Floods, and Autumns have their Springs; All States have Changes hurried with the swings Of Chance, and Times, still tiding to and fro: Terrestriall Bodies and Celestiall too: How often have I vainly grop'd about, With lengthned Armes, to find a passage out, That I might catch those Beames mine eye desires, And bathe my soule in those Celestiall fires: Like as the Hagard, cloyster'd in her Mue, To scowre her downy Robes, and to renew Her broken Hags, preparing t'overlooke The tim'rous Malard at the sliding Brooke. Jets oft from Perch to Perch; from Stocks to ground; From ground to Window, thus surveying round Her dove-befeatherd Prison, till, at length, (Calling her noble Birth to mind, and strength Whereto her wing was borne) her ragged Beake Nips off her dangling Jesses, strives to breake Her gingling Fetters, and begins to bate At ev'ry glimpse, and darts at ev'ry grate: Ev'n so my wearie soule, that long has bin An Inmate in this Tenement of Sin, Lockt up by Cloud-brow'd Error, which invites My cloystred Thoughts to feed on black delights, Now scornes her shadowes, and begins to dart Her wing'd desires at Thee, that onely art The Sun she seeks, whose rising beames can fright These duskie Clouds that make so dark a night: Shine forth, great Glory, shine; that I may see Both how to loath my selfe, and honour Thee: But if my weaknesse force Thee to deny Thy Flames, yet lend the Twilight of thine Eye: If I must want those Beames I wish, yet grant, That I, at least, may wish those Beames I want. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. cap. 33. There was a great and darke cloud of vanity before mine eyes, so that I could not see the Sun of Justice, and the light of Truth: I being the Son of darknesse, was involved in darknesse: I loved my darknesse, because I knew not thy Light: I was blind, and loved my blindnesse, and did walke from darkenesse to darkenesse: But Lord, thou art my God, who hast led me from darknesse, and the shadow of death; hast called me into this glorious light, and behold, I see.

O Lord, thou knowest my foolishnesse, and my sinnes are not hid from thee. Seest thou this fulsome Ideot? In what measure He seemes transported with the antick pleasure Of childish Baubles? Canst thou but admire The empty fulnesse of his vaine desire? Canst thou conceive such poore delights as these Can fill th'insatiate soule of Man, or please The fond Aspect of his deluded eye? Reader, such very fooles are thou and I: False puffs of Honour; the deceitfull streames Of wealth; the idle, vaine, and empty dreames Of pleasure, are our Traffick, and ensnare Our soules; the threefold subject of our Care: We toyle for Trash, we barter solid Joyes For ayry Trifles; sell our Heav'n for Toyes: We snatch at Barly graines, whilst Pearles stand by Despis'd; Such very Fooles are Thou and I: Aym'st thou at Honour? Does not th'Ideot shake it In his left hand? Fond man, step forth and take it: Or wouldst thou Wealth? See how the foole presents thee With a full Basket; if such Wealth contents thee: Wouldst thou take pleasure? If the Foole unstride His prauncing Stallion, thou mayst up, and ride: Fond man: Such is the Pleasure, Wealth, and Honour That earth affords such Fooles as dote upon her; Such is the Game whereat earths Ideots flie; Such Ideots, ah, such Fooles are thou and I: Had rebell-mans Foole-hardinesse extended No further than himselfe, and there, had ended, It had been Just; but, thus, enrag'd to flie Upon th'eternall eyes of Majesty, And drag the Son of Glory, from the brest Of his indulgent Father: to arrest His great and sacred Person; in disgrace, To spit and spaule upon his Sun-bright face; To taunt him with base termes; and, being bound, To scourge his soft, his trembling sides; to wound His head with Thornes; his heart, with humane feares; His hands, with nayles; and his pale Flanck with speares; And, then, to paddle in the purer steame Of his spilt Blood, is more than most extreame: Great Builder of mankind, canst thou propound All this to thy bright eyes, and not confound Thy handy-work? O, canst Thou choose but see, That mad'st the Eye? Can ought be hid from Thee? Thou seest our persons, LORD, and not our Guilt; Thou seest not what thou maist, but what thou wilt: The Hand, that form'd us, is enforc'd to be A Screene set up betwixt thy Work and Thee: Looke, looke upon the Hand, and thou shalt spy An open wound, a Throughfare for thine Eye; Or if that wound be clos'd, that passage be Deny'd betweene Thy gracious eyes, and me, Yet view the Scarre; That Scarre will countermand Thy Wrath: O read my Fortune in thy Hand. S. CHRYS. Hom. 4. Ioan.

Jesus: Poore Soule, what ail'st thou? Soule: O I burne, I fry; I cannot rest; I know not where to fly To find some ease; I turne my blubber'd face From man to man; I roule from place to place, T'avoid my tortures, to obtaine reliefe, But still am dogg'd and haunted with my griefe: My midnight torments call the sluggish light, And when the morning's come, they woo the night. Jesus: Surcease thy teares, and speake thy free desires; Soule: Quench, quench my flames, and swage these scorching fires: Jesus: Canst thou believe my hand can cure thy griefe; Soule: Lord, I believe; Lord, help my unbelefe: Jesus: Hold forth thy Arme, and let my fingers try Thy Pulse; where (chiefly) does the torment lie? Soule: From head to foot; it raignes in ev'ry part But playes the selfe-law'd Tyrant in my heart. Jesus: Canst thou digest? canst relish wholsome food? How stands thy tast?

That Launce that shall Let forth my bloud, lets forth my life withall; My soule wants Cordialls, and has greater need Of blood, than (being spent so farre) to bleed; I faint already: If I bleed, I die; Jesus: 'Tis either thou must bleed, sicke soule, or I: My blood's a cordiall: He that suckes my veines, Shall cleanse his owne, and conquer greater paines Than these: Cheere up: this precioius Blood of mine Shall cure thy Griefe; my heart shall bleed for thine: Believe, and view me with a faithfull eye; Thy soule shall neither languish, bleed, nor die S.

Looke upon my affliction and my paine, and forgive all my sinnes. Both worke, and stroakes? Both lash, and labour too? What more could Edom, or proud Ashur doe? Lord, has thy scourge no mercy, and my woes No end? My paines no ease? No intermission? Is this the state? Is this the sad condition Of those that trust thee? Will thy goodnesse please T'allow no other favours? None but these? Will not the Rethrick of my torments move? Are these the symptoms? these the signs of love? Is't not enough, enough that I fulfill The toylsome task of thy laborious Mill? May not this labour expiate, and purge My sinne, without th'addition of thy scourge? Looke on my cloudy brow, how fast it raines Sad showers of sweat, thus the fruits of fruitlesse paines: Behold these ridges; see what purple furrowes Thy plow has made; O think upon those sorrowes, That once were thine; wilt, wilt thou not be woo'd To mercy, by the charmes of sweat and blood? Canst thou forget that drowsie Mount, wherein Thy dull Disciples slept? Was not my sinne There, punish'd in thy soule? Did not this brow Then sweat in thine? Were not those drops enow? Remember Golgotha, where that spring-tide Oreflow'd thy sov'raigne Sacramentall side; There was no sinne; there was no guilt in Thee, That call'd those paines; Thou sweatst; thou bledst for me: Was there not blood enough, when one small drop Had pow'r to ransome thousand worlds, and stop The mouth of Justice? Lord, I bled before, In thy deepe wounds: Can Justice challenge more? Or doest thou vainly labour to hedge in Thy losses from my sides? My blood is thin; And thy free bounty scornes such easie thrift; No, no, thy blood came not as lone, but gift: But must I ever grinde? And must I earne Nothing but stripes? O, wilt thou disalterne The rest thou gav'st? Hast thou perus'd the curse Thou laidst on Adams fall, and made it worse? Canst thou repent of mercy? Heav'n thought good Lost man should feed in sweat; not work in blood: Why dost thou wound th'already wounded brest? Ah me; my life is but a paine at best? I am but dying dust: my dayes, a span; What pleasure tak'st thou in the blood of man? Spare, spare thy scourge, and be not so austere; Send fewer stroakes, or lend more strength to beare. S. BERN.

I am a miserable man; but a free man: free, because a man; Miserable, because a servant: In regard of my bondage, miserable; In regard of my will, inexcusable: For my will, that was free, beslaved it selfe to sinne, by assenting to sinne; for he that commits sin, is the servant to sinne. EPIGRAM 4. [Taxe not thy God: Thine owne defaults did urge] Taxe not thy God: Thine owne defaults did urge This twofold punishment; the Mill, the Scourge: Thy sin's the Author of thy self-tormenting: Thou grind'st for sinning; scourg'd for not repenting. V. JOB X. IX. Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me to dust againe? Thus from the bosome of the new-made earth Poore man was delv'd, and had his unborne birth: The same the stuff; the selfe-same hand does trim The Plant that fades; the Beast that dies; and Him: One was their Syre; one was their common mother: Plants are his sisters; and the Beast; his brother, The elder too, Beasts draw the selfe-same breath, Waxe old alike, and die the selfe same-death: Plants grow as he, with fairer robes arraid; Alike they flourish, and alike they fade: The beast, in sense, exceeds him; and, in growth, The three-ag'd Oake doth thrice exceed them both: Why look'st thou then so big, thou little span Of earth? What art thou more, in being man? I; but my great Creator did inspire My chosen earth with that diviner fire Of Reason; gave me Judgement, and a Will; That, to know good; this, to chuse good from ill: He puts the raines of pow'r in my free hand, And juridiction over sea and land: He gave me art, to lengthen out my span Of life, and made me all, in being man: I; but thy Passion has committed treason Against the sacred person of thy Reason: Thy Judgement is corrupt; peverse thy Will; That knowes no good; and this makes choice of ill: The greater height sends downe the deeper fall, And good, declin'd, turnes bad; turnes worst of all. Say then, proud inch of living earth, what can Thy greatnesse claime the more in being man? O, but my soule transcends the pitch of nature, Borne up by th'image of her high Creator; Out-braves the life of reason, and beats downe Her waxen wings, kicks off her brazen Crowne; My earth's a living Temple t'entertaine The King of Glory, and his glorious traine: How can I mend my Title then? where can Ambition find a higher stile than man? Ah, but that Image is defac'd and soil'd; Her Temple raz'd, her altars all defil'd; Her vessels are polluted, and distain'd With loathed lust; her ornaments prophan'd; Her oyle-forsaken lamps, and hallow'd Tapours Put out; her incense breaths unsav'ry vapours: Why swel'st thou then so big, thou little span Of earth? What art thou more in being man? Eternall Potter, whose blest hands did lay My course foundation from a sod of clay, Thou know'st my slender vessell's apt to leake: Thou know'st my brittle Temper's prone to breake; Are my Bones Brazzill, or my Flesh of Oake? O, mend what thou hast made, what have I broke: Looke, looke with gentle eyes, and in thy day Of vengeance, Lord, remember I am clay. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. 32. Shall I ask, who made me? It was thou that madest me, without who nothing was made: Thou art my Maker, and I thy worke: I thank thee my Lord God, by whom I live, and by whom all things subsist, because thou madest me: I thank thee O my Potter, because thy hands have made me, because thy hands have formed me. EPIGRAM 5. [Why swell'st thou, Man, puft up with Fame, and Purse?] Why swell'st thou, Man, puft up with Fame, and Purse? Th'art better earth, but borne to dig the worse: Thou cam'st from earth, to earth thou must returne; And art but earth, cast from the wombe, to th'urne. VI. JOB VII. XX. Lord I have sinned: What shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men; why hast thou set me as a marke against thee? Lord I have done: and Lord, I have misdone; 'Tis folly to contest, to strive with one, That is too strong; 'tis folly to assaile Or prove an Arme, that will, that must prevaile? I've done, I've done; these trembling hands have throwne Their daring weapons downe: The day's thine owne; Forbeare to strike, where thou hast won the field; The palme, the palme is thine: I yeeld, I yeeld. These treach'rous hands, that were so vainly bold To try a thrivelesse combat, and to hold Selfe-wounding weapons up, are now extended For mercy from thy hand; that knee that bended Upon her guardlesse guard, does now repent Upon this naked floore; See, both are bent, And sue for pitie; O, my ragged wound Is deep and desp'rate; it is drench'd and drown'd In blood, and briny teares: It does begin To stink without, and putrifie within: Let that victorious hand, that now appeares Just in my blood, prove gracious to my teares: Thou great Preserver of presumptuous man, What shall I do? What satisfaction can Poore dust and ashes make? O, if that blood That yet remaines unshed, were halfe as good As the blood of Oxen; if my death might be An offring to attone my God and me, I would disdaine injurious life, and stand A suiter, to be wounded from thy hand: But may thy wrongs be measur'd by the span Of life? or balanc'd with the blood of man? No, no, eternall sin expects, for guardon, Eternall penance, or eternall pardon: Lay downe thy weapons; turne thy wrath away; And pardon him that hath no price to pay; Enlarge that soule, which base presumption binds; Thy justice cannot loose what mercy finds: O thou that wilt not bruise the broken reed, Rub not my sores, nor prick the wounds that bleed: Lord, if the peevish Infant fights, and flies, With unpar'd weapons, at his mothers eyes, Her frownes (halfe mixt with smiles) may chance to show An angry love-trick on his arme, or so; Where, if the babe but make a lip and cry, Her heart begins to melt; and, by and by, She coakes his deawy cheeks; her babe she blisses And choaks her language with a thousand kisses: I am that child; loe, here I prostrate lie, Pleading for mercy: I repent, and cry For gracious pardon: let thy gentle eares Heare that in words, what mothers judge in teares: See not my frailties, Lord, but through my feare, And looke on ev'ry trespasse through a teare: Then calme thy anger, and appeare more mild: Remember, th'art a Father; I, a child. S. BERN. Ser. 21 in Cant. Miserable man! Who shall deliver me from the reproach of this shamefull bondage? I am miserable man, but a free man: Free, because like to God, miserable, because against God: O keeper of mankind, why hast thou set me as a marke against thee? Thou hast set me, because thou hast not hindred me: It is just that thy enemy should be my enemy, and that he who repugnes thee, should repugne me: I who am against thee, am against my self. EPIGRAM 6. [But form'd, and fight? But borne, and then rebell?] But form'd, and fight? But borne, and then rebell? How small a blast will make a bubble swell? But dare the floore affront the hand that laid it? So apt is dust to fly in's face that made it. VII. JOB XIII. XXIV. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thy enemie? Why dost thou shade thy lovely face? O why Does that ecclipsing hand, so long, deny The Sun-shine of thy soule-enliv'ning eye? Without that Light, what light remaines in me? Thou art my Life, my Way, my Light; in Thee I live, I move, and by thy beames I see: Thou art my Life: If thou but turne away, My life's a thousand deaths: thou art my Way; Without thee, Lord, I travell not, but stray. My Light thou art; without thy glorious sight, Mine eyes are darkned with perpetuall night: My God, thou art my Way, my Life, my Light. Thou art my Way; I wander, if thou flie: Thou art my Light; If hid, how blind am I? Thou art my Life; If thou withdraw, I die: Mine eyes are blind and darke; I cannot see; To whom, or whether should my darknesse flee, But to the Light? And who's that Light but Thee? My path is lost; my wandring steps do stray; I cannot safely go, nor safely stray; Whom should I seek but Thee, my Path, my Way? O, I am dead: To whom shall I, poore I Repaire? To whom shall my sad Ashes fly But Life? And where is Life but in thine eye? And yet thou turn'st away thy face, and fly'st me; And yet I sue for Grace, and thou den'st me; Speake, art thou angry, Lord, or onely try'st me? Unskreene those heav'nly lamps, or tell me why Thou shad'st thy face; Perhaps, thou think'st, no eye Can view those flames, and not drop downe and die: If that be all; shine forth, and draw thee nigher; Let me behold and die; for my desire Is Phoenix-like to perish in that Fire. Death-conquer'd Laz'rus was redeem'd by Thee; If I am dead, Lord set deaths prisner free; Am I more spent, or think I worse than he? If my pufft light be out, give me leave to tine My flamelesse snuffe at that bright Lamp of thine; O what's thy Light the lesse for lighting mine? If I have lost my Path, great Shepheard, say, Shall I still wander in a doubtfull way? Lord, shall a Lamb of Isr'els sheepfold stray? Thou art the Pilgrims Path; the blind mans Eye; The dead mans Life; on thee my hopes rely; If thou remove, I erre; I grope; I die: Disclose thy Sun-beames; close thy wings, and stay; See see, how I am blind, and dead, and stray, O thou, that art my Light my Life, my Way. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. Cap.1. Why dost thou hade thy face? Happily thou wilt say, none can see thy face and live: Ah Lord, let me die, that I may see thee; let me see thee, that I may die: I would not live, but die; That I may see Christ. I desire death; that I may live with Christ, I despise life. ANSELM. Med. Cap. 5. O excellent hiding, which is become my perfection! My God, thou hidest thy treasure, to kindle my desire; Thou hidest thy pearle, to inflame the seeker; thou delay'st to give, that thou maist teach me to importune: seem'st not to heare, to make me persevere. EPIGRAM 7. [If heav'ns all-quickning Eyes vouchsafe to shine] If heav'ns all-quickning Eyes vouchsafe to shine Upon our soules, we slight; If not, we whine; Our Eqinoctiall hearts can never lie Secure, beneath the Tropicks of that eye. VIII. JEREMIAH IX. I. O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night. O that mine eyes were springs, and could transforme Their drops to seas! My sighs, into a storme Of Zeale, and sacred Violence, wherein This lab'ring vessell, laden with her sin, Might suffer sodaine shipwracke, and be split Upon that Rock, where my drench'd soule may sit Orewhelm'd with plenteous passion; O, and there Drop, drop into an everlasting teare! Ah me! that ev'ry sliding veine that wanders Through this vast Isle, did worke her wild Meanders In Brackish teares, instead of blood, and swell This flesh with holy Dropsies, from whose Well, Made warme with sighs, may fume my wasting breath, Whilst I dissolve in steames, and reeke to death! These narrow sluces of my dribling eyes Are much too streight for those quick springs that rise, And hourely fill my Temples to the top; I cannot shed for ev'ry sin a drop; Great builder of mankind, why hast thou sent Such swelling floods, and made so small a vent? O that this flesh had been compos'd of snow, Instead of earth; and bones of Ice, and so, Feeling the Fervor of my sin; and lothing The fire I feele, I might be thaw'd to nothing! O thou, that didst, with hopefull joy, entombe Me thrice three Moones in thy laborious wombe, And then, with joyfull paine, brought forth a Son, What worth thy labour, has thy labour done? What was there? Ah! what was there in my birth That could deserve the easiest smile of mirth? A man was borne: Alas, and what's a man? A scuttle full of dust, a measur'd span Of flitting Time; a furnish'd Pack, whose wares Are sullen griefs, and soule-tormenting Cares: A vale of teares; a vessell tunn'd with breath, By sicknesse broacht, to be drawne out by death: A haplesse, helplesse thing; that, borne, does cry To feed; that feeds to live; that lives to die. Great God and Man, whose eyes spent drops so often For me, that cannot weepe enough; O soften These marble braines, and strike this flinty rock; Or if the musick of thy Peters Cock Will more prevaile, fill, fill my hearkning eares With that sweet sound, that I may melt in teares: I cannot weepe, untill thou broach mine eye; Or give me vent, or els I burst, and die. S. AMBROS. in Psal. 118. He that commits sinnes to be wept for, cannot weepe for sinnes committed: And being himselfe most lamentable, hath no teares to lament his offences. NAZIANZ. Orat. 3. Teares are the deluge of sinne, and the worlds sacrifice. S. HIEROM. in Esaiam. Prayer appeases God, but a teare compels him: That moves him but this constraines him. EPIGRAM 8. [Earth is an Island ported round with Feares] Earth is an Island ported round with Feares; The way to Heav'n is through the Sea of teares: It is a stormy passage, where is found The wracke of many a ship, but no man drown'd. IX. PSALMS XVIII. V. The sorrowes of hell compassed me about, and the snares of death prevented me. Is not this Type well cut? In ev'ry part Full of rich cunning? fil'd with Zeuxian Art? Are not the Hunters, and their Stygean Hounds Limm'd full to th'life? Didst ever heare the sounds, The musicke, and the lip-divided breaths Of the strong-winded Horne, Recheats, and deaths Done more exact? Th'infernall Nimrods hollow? The lawlesse Purliews? and the Game they follow? The hidden Engines? and the snares that lie So undiscover'd, so obscure to th'eye? The new-drawne net? and her entangled Pray? And him that closes it? Beholder, say, Is't not well-done? seemes not an em'lous strife Betwixt the rare cut picture, and the life? These Purlieu-men are Devils; And the Hounds, (Those quick-nos'd Canibals that scoure the grounds) Temptations; and the Game these Fiends pursue, Are humane soules, which still they have in view; Whose Fury if they chance to scape, by flying, The skilfull Hunter plants his net, close lying On th'unsuspected earth, baited with treasure, Ambitions honour, and selfe-wasting pleasure; Where if the soule but stoope, death stands prepar'd To draw the net, and drawne, the soule's ensnar'd. Poore soule! how art thou hurried to and fro? Where canst thou safely stay? where safely go? If stay; these hot-mouth'd Hounds are apt to teare thee, If goe; the snares enclose, the nets ensnare thee: What good in this bad world has pow'r t'invite thee A willing Guest? wherein can earth delight thee? Her pleasures are but Itch; Her wealth, but Cares; A world of dangers, and a world of snares: The close Pursuers busie hands do plant Snares in thy substance; Snares attend thy want; Snares in thy credit; Snares in thy disgrace; Snares in thy high estate; Snares in thy base; Snares tuck thy bed; and Snares arround thy boord; Snares watch thy thoughts; and Snares attache thy word; Snares in thy quiet; Snares in thy Commotions; Snares in thy diet; Snares in thy devotion; Snares lurk in thy resolves; Snares, in thy doubt; Snares lie within thy heart, and Snares, without; Snares are above thy head, and Snares, beneath; Snares in thy sicknesse; Snares are in thy death: O, if these Purlieus be so full of danger, Great God of Harts, the worlds sole sov'raigne Ranger, Preserve thy Deere, and let my soule be blest In thy safe Forrest, where I seeke for rest: Then let the Hell-hounds roare; I feare no ill; Rouze me they may, but have no pow'r to kill. S. AMBROS. Lib. 4 in Cap. 4 Lucae. The reward of honours, the height of power, the delicacie of diet, and the beauty of a harlot are the snares of the Devill. S. AMBROS. de bono mortis. Whilst thou seekest pleasures, thou runnest into snares, for the eye of the harlot is the snare of the Adiulterer. SAVANAR. In eating, he sets before us Gluttony; In generation, luxury; In labour, sluggishnesse; In conversing, envy; in governing, covetousnesse; In correcting, anger; In honour, pride; In the heart, he sets evill thoughts; In the mouth, evill words; in actions evill workes; when awake, he moves us to evill actions; when asleepe, to filthy dreames. EPIGRAM 9. [Be sad, my Heart, Deep dangers wait thy mirth] Be sad, my Heart, Deep dangers wait thy mirth; Thy soule's way-laid by sea; by Hell; by earth; Hell has her hounds; Earth, snares; the Sea, a shelfe; But most of all, my heart, beware thy selfe. X. PSALMS CXLIII. II. Enter not into judgement with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living bee justified. Jesus. Justice. Sinner. Jesus: Bring forth the prisner, Justice. Justice: Thy comands Are done, just Judge; See, here the prisner stands Jesus: What has the prisner done? Say; what's the cause Of his committment? Justice: He has broken the lawes Of his too gracious God; conspir'd the death Of that great Majesty that gave him breath. And heapes transgression, Lord, upon transgression: Jesus: How know'st thou this? Justice: Ev'n by his own confession: His sinnes are crying; and they cry'd aloud; They cry'd to heav'n; they cry'd to heav'n for blood: Jesus: What sayst thou sinner? Hast thou ought to plead, That sentence should not passe? Hold up thy head, And shew thy brazen, thy rebellious face. Sinner: Ah me! I dare not: I'm too vile, and base, To tread upon thy earth, much more, to lift Mine eyes to heav'n; I need no other shrift Than mine owne conscience; Lord, I must confesse, I am no more than dust, and no whit less Than my Inditement stiles me; Ah, if thou Search too severe, with too severe a Brow, What Flesh can stand? I have transgrest thy lawes; My merits plead thy vengeance; not my cause. Justice: Lord shall I strike the blow? Jesus: Hold, Justice, stay, Sinner, speake on; what hast thou more to, say? Sinner: Vile as I am, and of my selfe abhor'd, I am thy handy-worke, thy creature, Lord, Stampt with thy glorious Image, and first, Most like to thee, though now a poore accurst Convicted Caitiffe, and degen'ous creature, Here trembling at thy Bar. Justice: Thy fault's the greater; Lord shall I strike the blow? Jesus: Hold, Justice, stay, Speake, sinner; hast thou nothing more to say? Sinner: Nothing but Mercy, Mercy; Lord, my state Is miserably poore, and desperate; I quite renounce my selfe, the world, and flee From Lord to Jesus; from thy selfe, to Thee, Justice: Cease thy vaine hopes; my angry God has vow'd: Abused mercy must have blood for blood: Shall I yet strike the blow? Jesus: Stay, Justice, hold; My bowels yearne, my fainting blood growes cold, To view the trembling wretch; Me thinks, I spye My fathers Image in the prisners eye: Justice: I cannot hold. Jesus: Then turne thy thirsty blade Into my sides: let there the wound be made Cheare up, deare soule; Redeeme thy life with mine: My soule shall smart; My heart shall bleed for thine. Sinner: O ground-lesse deepes! O love beyond degree! Th'offended dies, to set th'offender free. S. AUGUST. Lord, if I have done that, for which thou mayest damne me: thou hast not lost that, whereby thou mayest save me: Remember not, sweet Jesus, thy Justice against the sinner, but thy benignity towards thy Creature: Remember not to proceed against a guilty soule, but remember thy mercy towards a miserable wretch: Forget the insolence of the provoker, and behold the misery of the invoker; for what is Jesus but a Saviour. ANSELM. Have respect to what thy Sonne hath done for me, and forget what my sinnes have done against thee: My flesh hath provoked thee to vengeance; let the flesh of Christ move thee to mercy: It is much that my rebellions have deserved; but it is more that my Redeemer hath merited. EPIGRAM 10. [Mercy of mercies! He that was my drudge] Mercy of mercies! He that was my drudge Is now my Advocate, is now my Judge: He suffers, pleads, and sentences, alone; Thee I adore, and yet adore but One. XI. PSALMS LXIX. XV. Let not the water-flood over-flow me, neither let the deepes swallow me up. The world's a Sea; my flesh, a ship, that's man'd With lab'ring Thoughts; and steer'd by Reasons hand: My heart's the Sea-mans Card, whereby she sailes; My loose Affections are the greater Sailes: The Top-saile is my Fancy; and the Gusts That fill these wanton Sheets, are worldly Lusts. Pray'r is the Cable, at whose end appeares The Anchor Hope, nev'r slipt but in our feares: My Will's th'unconstant Pilot, that commands The staggring Keele; my Sinnes are like the Sands. Repentance is the Bucket; and mine Eye The Pumpe, unus'd (but in extreames) and dry. My conscience is the Plummet, that does presse The deepes, but seldome cryes, A fathom lesse: Smooth Calm's security; The Gulph, despaire; My Freight's Corruption, and this Life's my Fare: My soule's the Passenger, confusedly driven From feare to fright; her landing Port, is Heaven. My seas are stormy, and my Ship does leake; My Saylers rude: My Steersman faint and weake: My Canvace torne, it flaps from side to side; My Cable's crackt; my Anchor's slightly ty'd; My Pilot's craz'd; my shipwrack sands are cloak'd; My Calm's deceitfull; and my Gulph too neare; My wares are slubber'd; and my Fare's too deare: My Plummet's light, it cannot sink nor sound; O shall my Rock-bethreatned Soule be drown'd? Lord still the seas, and shield my ship from harme; Instruct my saylours; guide my Steersmans Arme; Touch thou my Compasse, and renew my Sailes; Send stiffer courage, or send milder gales; Make strong my Cable; bind my Anchor faster; Direct my Pilot, and be thou his Master; Object the Sands to my more serious view, Make sound my Bucket; bore my Pumpe anew; New cast my Plummet, make it apt to try Where the Rocks lurke, and where the Quicksands lie; Guard thou the Gulph, with love; my Calmes, with Care; Cleanse thou my Freight; accept my slender Fare; Refresh the sea-sick passenger; cut short His Voyage; land him in his wished Port: Thou, thou, whom winds and stormy seas obay, That, through the deeps, gav'st grumbling Isr'ell way, Say to my soule, be safe; and then mine eye Shall scorne grim death, although grim death stand by; O thou whose strength-reviving Arme did cherish Thy sinking Peter, at the point to perish, Reach forth thy hand, or bid me tread the Wave, Ile come, Ile come, The voice that cals will save. S. AMBROS. Apol. post. pro David. Cap. 3. The confluence of lusts makes a great Tempest, which in this sea disturbes the sea-faring soule, that reason cannot governe it. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. Cap. 35. We labour in a boysterous sea: Thou standest upon the shore and seest our dangers: Give us grace to hold a middle course betwixt Scylla and Charybdis, that both dangers escaped, we may arrive at our Port, secure. EPIGRAM 11. [My soule; the seas are rough; and thou a stranger] My soule; the seas are rough; and thou a stranger In these false coasts; O keep aloofe; there's danger: Cast forth thy Plummet; see a rock appeares; Thy ship wants sea-roome; Make it with thy teares. XII. JOB XIV. XIII. O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, and thou wouldst keepe me secret untill thy wrath be past. O whether shall I flee? what path untrod Shall I seeke out, to scape the flaming rod Of my offended, of my angry God? Where shall I sojourne? What kind sea will hide My head from Thunder? where shall I abide, Untill his flames be quench'd, or laid aside! What if my feet should take their hasty flight, And seeke protection in the shades of night? Alas, no shades can blind the God of Light: What, if my soule should take the wings of day, And find some desart; if she spring away, The wings of vengeance clip as fast as they: What if some solid Rock should entertaine My frighted soule? Can solid Rocks restraine The stroke of Justice, and not cleave in twaine? Nor Sea, nor Shade, nor Shield, nor Rock, nor Cave, Nor silent desarts, nor the sullen grave, Where flame-ey'd fury meanes to smite, can save. The Seas will part; graves open; Rocks will split; The shield will cleave; the frighted shadowes flit; Where Justice aimes, her fiery darts must hit. No, no, if sterne-brow'd vengeance meanes to thunder, There is no, place, beneath, nor under, So close, but will unlocke, nor rive in sunder. 'Tis vaine to flee; 'Tis neither here nor there Can scape that hand untill that hand forbeare; Ah me! where is he not, that's every where? 'Tis vaine to flee; till gentle mercy show Her better eye, the farther off we go, The swing of Justice deales the mightier blow: Th'ingenious child, corrected, does not flie His angry mothers hand, but clings more nigh, And quenches, with his teares, her flaming eye. Shadowes are faithlesse, and the rockes are false; No trust in brasse; no trust in marble wals; Poore Cotts are ev'n as safe as Princes Hals: Great God, there is no safety here below; Thou art my Fortresse, though thou seem'st my foe, 'Tis thou, that strik'st the stroke, must guard the blow: Thou art my God; by thee I fall or stand; Thy Grace hath giv'n me courage to withstand All tortures, but my Conscience, and thy Hand. I know thy Justice is thy selfe; I know, Just God, thy very selfe is mercy too; If not to thee, where? whether should I go? Then work thy will; If passion bid me flee, My Reason shall obey; my wings shall be Stretcht out no further than from Thee to Thee. S. AUGUST. in Psal. 30. Whether flie I? To what place can I safely flie? To what mountaine? To what den? To what strong house? What Castle shall I hold? What wals shall hold me? Whethersoever I go, myself followes me: For whatsoever thou flyest, O man, thou mayst, but thy owne Conscience: wheresoever O Lord I go, I find thee, if angry, a Revenger; if appeas'd, a Redeemer: What way have I, but to flee from thee, to thee: That thou maist avoid thy God, address thee to thy Lord. EPIGRAM 12. [Hath vengeance found thee? Can thy feares command] Hath vengeance found thee? Can thy feares command No Rocks to shield thee from her thundring hand? Know'st thou not where to scape? Ile tell thee where; My soule make cleane thy Conscience; Hide thee there. XIII. JOB X. XX. Are not my dayes few? Cease then, and let me alone, that I may bewaile my selfe a little. My Glasse is halfe unspent: Forbeare t'arrest My thriftlesse day too soone: My poore request Is that my glasse may run but out the rest. My time-devoured minutes wilbe done Without thy help; See, see how swift they run; Cut not my thred before my thred be spun. The gaine's not great I purchase by this stay; What losse sustain'st thou by so small delay, To whom ten thousand yeares are but a day. My following eye can hardly make a shift To count my winged houres; thy flie so swift, They scarce deserve the bounteous name of gift. The secret wheeles of hurrying Time do give So short a warning, and so fast they drive, That I am dead before I seeme to live: And what's a life? A weary Pilgrimage, Whose glory, in one day, doth fill the stage With Childhood, Manhood, and decrepit Age. And what's a Life; the flourishing Array Of the proud Summer meadow, which to day Weares her greene Plush; and is, to morrow, Hay. And what's a Life? A blast sustain'd with clothing, Maintain'd with food; retain'd with vile selfe-loathing, Then weary of its selfe, again'd to nothing. Read on this diall, how the shades devoure My short-liv'd winters day; How'r eats up howre; Alas, the total's but from eight to foure. Behold these Lillies (which thy hands have made Faire copies of my life, and open laid To view) how soone they droop, how soone they fade! Shade not that diall night will blind too soone; My nonag'd day already points to noone; How simple is my suit! How small my Boone! Nor do I beg this slender inch, to while The time away, or falsly to beguile My thoughts with joy; Here's nothing worth a smile. No, no: 'Tis not to please my wanton eares With frantick mirth; I beg but howres; not yeares: And what thou giv'st, I will give to teares. Draw not that soule which would be rather led; That Seed has yet not broke my Serpents head; O shall I die before my sinnes are dead? Behold these Rags; Am I a fitting Guest To tast the dainties of thy royall feast, With hands and face unwash'd, ungirt, unblest? First, let the Jordan streames (that find supplies From the deepe fountaine of my heart) arise, And cleane my spots, and cleare my leprous eyes: I have a world of sinnes to be lamented; I have a sea of teares that must be vented; O spare till then; and then I die, contented. S. AUGUST. lib. 7 de Civit. Dei cap. 10. The time wherein we live is taken from the space of our life; and what remaines is daily made lesse and lesse, insomuch that the time of our life is nothing but a passage to death. S. GREG. lib. 9 mor cap. 44 in Cap. 10 Job. As moderate afflictions bring teares; so immoderate take away teares; Insomuch that sorrow becomes no sorrow which swallowing up the mind of the afflicted, takes away the sense of the affliction. EPIGRAM 13. [Fear'st thou to go, when such an Arme invites thee?] Fear'st thou to go, when such an Arme invites thee? Dread'st thou thy loads of sin? or what affrights thee? If thou begin to feare, thy feare begins; Foole, can he beare thee hence, and not thy sinnes? XIV. DEUTERONOMY XXXII. XXIX. O that men were wise, and that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end. Flesh. Spirit. Flesh: What meanes my sisters eyes so oft to passe Through the long entry of that Optick glasse? Tell me; what secret virtue does invite Thy wrinckled eye to such unknowne delight? Spirit: It helps the sight; makes things remote appeare In perfect view; It drawes the object neare. Flesh: What sense-delighting objects doest thou spie? What does that Glasse present before thine eye? Spirit: I see thy foe, my reconciled friend, Grim death, even standing at the Glasses end; His left hand holds a branch of Palme; his right Holds forth a two-edg'd sword. Flesh: A proper sight! And is this all? does thy Prospective please Th'abused fancy with no shapes but these? Spirit: Yes, I behold the dark'ned Sun bereav'n Of all his light, the battlements of heav'n Sweltring in Flames; the Angell-guarded Sonne Of glory on his high Tribunall Throne; I see a Brimstone Sea of boyling Fire, And Fiends, with knotted whips of flaming Wyre, Tort'ring poore soules, that gnash their teeth, in vaine, And gnaw their flame-tormented tongues, for paine; Looke sister, how the queazie-stomack'd Graves Vomit their dead, and how the puple waves Scal'd their consumelesse bodies, strongly cursing All wombes for bearing, and all paps for nursing: Flesh: Can thy distemper'd fancie take delight In view of Tortures? These are showes t'affright: Looke in this glasse-Triangular; looke here, Here's that will ravish eyes. Spirit: What seest thou there? Flesh: The world in colours; colours that distaine The cheeks of Proteus, or the silken Traine Of Floras Nymphs; such various sorts of hiew, As Sun-confronting Iris never knew: Here, if thou please to beautifie a Towne, Thou maist; or, with a hand, turn't upside downe; Here, maist thou scant or widen by the measure Of thine owne will; make short or long, at pleasure: Here maist thou tyre they fancie, and advize With showes more apt to please more curious eyes; Spirit: Ah foole! that dot'st on vaine, on present toyes, And disrespects those true, those future joyes! How strongly are thy thoughts befool'd, Alas, To dote on goods that perish with thy Glasse! Nay, vanish with the turning of a hand! Were they but painted colours, it might stand With painted reason, that they might devote thee; But things that have no being, to besot thee? Foresight of future torments is the way To baulk those ills which present joyes bewray; As thou hast fool'd thy selfe, so now come hither, Break that fond glasse, and let's be wise together. BONAVENT. de contemptu seculi. O that men would be wise, understand, and foresee: Be wise, to know three things: The multitude of those that are to be damned; the few number of those that are to be saved; and the vanity of transitory things: Understand three things: the multitude of sinnes, the omission of good things, and the losse of time: Foresee three things, the danger of death, the last judgement, and eternall punishment. EPIGRAM 14. [What soule, no father yet? what nev'r commence] What soule, no father yet? what nev'r commence Master in Faith? Still Batchelour of Sense? Is't insufficiency? Or, what has made thee Oreslip thy lost degree? Thy lusts have staid thee. XV. PSALMS XXX. X. My life is spent with griefe, and my yeares with sighing. What sullen Starre rul'd my untimely birth, That would not lend my dayes one houre of mirth! How oft have these bare knees been bent, to gaine The slender Almes of one poore smile, in vaine! How often, tir'd with the fastidious light, Have my faint lips implor'd the shades of night? How often have my nightly Torments praid For lingring twilight, glutted with the shade! Day, worse than night; night, worse than day, appeares; In feares I spend my nights; my dayes; in teares: I moane, unpitti'd; groane without reliefe, There is nor end, nor measure of my griefe; The smiling flow'r salutes the day; it growes Untouch'd with care; It neither spins, nor sowes; O that my tedious life were, like this flow'r, Or freed from griefe; or finish'd with an houre: Why was I borne? Why was I borne a man? And why proportion'd by so large a Span? Or why suspended from the common lot, And being borne to die, why die I not? Ah me! why is my sorrow-wasted breath Deny'd the easie priviledge of death? The branded Slave, that tugs the weary Oare, Obtaines the Sabbath of a welcome Shore; His ransom'd stripes are heal'd; His native soile Sweetens the mem'ry of his forreigne toyle: But ah! my sorrowes are not halfe so blest; My labour finds no point; my paines, no rest: I barter sighs for teares; and teares for Grones, Still vainly rolling Sysiphaean stones: Thou just Observer of our flying houres, That, with thy Adamantine fangs, devoures The brazen Monuments of renowned Kings, Does thy glasse stand? Or be thy moulting wings Unapt to flie? If not, why dost thou spare A willing brest; a brest, that stands so faire? A dying brest, that has but onely breath To beg a wound; and strength, to crave a death: O, that the pleased Heav'ns would once dissolve These fleshly fetters, that so fast involve My hampred soule; then should my soule be blest From all these ills, and wrap her thougts in rest: Till then, my dayes are moneths, my moneths are yeares; My yeares are ages, to be spent in teares: My Grief's entayl'd upom my wastfull breath, Which no Recov'ry can cut off, but death; Breath drawne in Cottages, pufft out in Thrones, Begins, continues, and concludes in Grones. INOCENT. de vilitate condit. humanae. O who will give mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I may bewaile the miserable ingresse of mans condition; the sinfull progresse of mans conversation, the damnable egresse in mans dissolution? I will consider with teares, whereof man was made, what man does, and what man is to do: Alas, he is formed of earth, conceived in sinne, borne to punishment; He does evill things, which are not lawfull; He does filthy things, which are not decent: He does vaine things, which are not expedient. EPIGRAM 15. [My heart, Thy life's a debt by Bond, which beares] My heart, Thy life's a debt by Bond, which beares A secret date; The use, is Grones and teares: Plead not; Usurious Nature will have all, As well the Int'rest, as the Principall. THE FOURTH BOOKE. I. ROMANS VII. XXIII. I see another Law in my members warring against the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivitie to the Law of sin. 1 O how my will is hurried to and fro, And how my unresolv'd resolves do varies! I know not where to fix; sometimes I goe This way; then that; and then the quite contrary: I like, dislike; lament for what I could not; I doe; undoe; yet still do what I should not; And at the selfe same instant; will the Thing I would not. 2 Thus are my weather-beaten Thoughts opprest With th'earth-bred winds of my prodigious will; Thus am I hourely tost from East to West Upon the rouling streames of Good and Ill: Thus am I driv'n upon these slipppry Sudds, From reall Ills to false apparent Goods; My life's a troubled sea, compos'd of Ebbs and Floods. 3 The curious Penman, having trim'd his Page With the dead language of his dabled Quill, Lets fall a heedlesse drop, then, in a Rage, Cashieres the fruits of his unlucky skill; Ev'n so my pregnant soule in th'infant bud Of her best thoughts, showres down a Cole-black flood Of unadvised Ills, and cancels all her Good. 4 Sometimes a sudden flash of sacred heat Warmes my chill soule, and sets my thoughts in frame: But soone that fire is shouldred from her seat By lustfull Cupids much inferiour flame; I feele two flames, and yet no flame, entire. Thus are the Mungrill thought of mixt desire Consum'd between that heav'nly and this earthly fire. 5 Sometimes my trash-disdaining thoughts out-passe The common Period of terrene conceit; O then, me thinks I scorne the Thing I was, Whilst I stand ravisht at my new Estate: But when th'Icarian wings of my desire Feele but the warmth of their owne native fire, O then they melt and plunge within their wonted mire. 6 I know the nature of my wav'ring mind; I know the frailty of my fleshly will: My Passion's Eagle-ey'd; my Judgement, blind; I know what's good, but yet make choice of ill; When the Ostrich wings of my desires shalbe So dull, they cannot mount the least degree, Yet grant my soule desire but of desiring Thee. S. BERN. Med. 9. My heart is a vaine, a vagabond, and instable heart; whilst it is led by its owne judgement, and wanting divine counsell, cannot subsist in it selfe, and whilst it divers ways seeks rest, finds none, but remaines miserable through labour, and void of peace: it agrees not with itselfe; it dissents from itselfe; it alters resolutions, changes the judgement, frames new thoughts, puls downe the old, and builds them up againe: It wils and wils not, and never remaines in the same state. S. AUGUST. de Ver. Apost. When it would it cannot, because when it might, it would not: Therefore, by an evill will man lost his good power. EPIGRAM 1. [My soule, how are thy thoughts disturb'd! confin'd] My soule, how are thy thoughts disturb'd! confin'd, Enlarg'd betwixt thy Members, and thy Mind! Fix here, or there; Thy doubt-depending cause Can nev'r expect one verdict, 'twixt two Lawes. II. PSALMS CXIX. V. O that my wayes were directed to keepe thy statutes. 1 Thus I, the object of the worlds disdaine, With Pilgrim-pace, surround the weary earth; I onely relish what the world counts vaine; Her mirth's my griefe; her sullen Griefe, my mirth; Her light, my darknesse; and her Truth, my Error; Her freedome is my Jayle; and her delight my Terror. 2 Fond earth! Proportion not my seeming love To my long stay; let not thy thoughts deceive thee; Thou art my Prison, and my Home's above; My life's a Preparation but to leave thee: Like one that seeks a doore, I walke about thee, With thee I cannot live; I cannot live without thee. 3 The world's a Lab'rinth, whose anfractious wayes Are all compos'd of Rubs, and crook'd Meanders; No resting here; Hee's hurried back that stayes A thought; And he that goes unguided, wanders: Her way is dark; her path untrod, unev'n; So hard's the way from earth; so hard's the way to Heav'n. 4 This gyring Lab'rinth is betrench'd about On either hand, with streames of sulphrous fire, Streames closely sliding, erring in and out, But seeming pleasant to the fond descrier; Where if his footsteps trust their owne Invention, He fals without redresse, and sinks beyond Demension. 5 Where shall I seek a Guide? Where shall I meet Some lucky hand to led my trembling paces? What trusty Lanterne will direct my feet To scape the danger of these dang'rous places? What hopes have I to passe without a Guide? Where one gets falsely through, a thousand fall beside. 6 An unrequested Starre did gently slide Before the Wisemen, to a greater Light; Back-sliding Isr'el found a double Guide; A Pillar, and a Cloud; by day, by night: Yet, in my desp'rate dangers, which be farre More great than theirs, I have nor Pillar, Cloud, nor Starre. 7 O, that the pineons of a clipping Dove Would cut my passage, through the empty Ayre; Mine eyes being seeld, how would I mount above The reach of danger, and forgotten Care! My backward eyes should ne'r commit that fault, Whose lasting Guilt should build a Monument of Salt. 8 Great God, that art the flowing Spring of Light, Enrich mine eyes with thy refulgent Ray: Thou art my Path; direct my steps aright; I have no other Light, no other Way: Ile trust my God, and him alone pursue; His Law shalbe my Path; his heav'nly Light my Clue. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. Cap. 4. O Lord, who art the Light, the Way, the Truth, the Life; in whom there is no darknesse, The way without which there is wandring; The Truth, without which there is errour; Life, without which there is death; Say, Lord, let there be light, and I shall see light, and eschue darknesse; I shall see the way, and avoid wandring; I shall see the truth, and shun errour; I shall see life, and escape death; Illuminate. O illuminate my blind soule, which sits in darknesse and the shadow of death, and direct my feet in the way of peace. EPIGRAM 2. [Pilgrim trudge on: What makes thy soule complaine] Pilgrim trudge on: What makes thy soule complaine, Crownes thy complaint: The way to rest is paine: The Road to Resolution lies by doubt: The next way Home's the farthest way about. III. PSALMS XVII. V. Stay my steps in thy paths, that my feet do not slide. 1 When ere the Old Exchange of Profit rings Her silver Saints-bell of uncertaine gaines, My merchant soule can stretch both legs and wings: How I can run, and take unwearied paines! The Charmes of Profit are so strong, that I Who wanted legs to go, find wings to fly. 2 If time-beguiling Pleasure but advance Her lustfull Trump, and blow her bold Alarms, O, how my sportfull soule can frisk and daunce, And hug that Syren in her twined Armes! The sprightly voice of sinew-strengthning Pleasure Can lend my bedrid soule both legs and leisure. 3 If blazing Honour chance to fill my veines With flattring warmth, and flash of Courtly fire, My soule can take a pleasure in her paines; My loftie strutting steps disdaine to tire: My antick knees can turne upon the hinges Of Complement, and skrue a thousand Cringes. 4 But when I come to Thee, my God, that art The royall Mine of everlasting Treasure, The reall Honour of my better part, And living Fountaine of eternall pleasure, How nervelesse are my limbs! how faint, and slow! I have nor wings to flie, nor legs to go. 5 So when the streames of swift-foot Rhene convay Her upland Riches to the Belgick shore; The idle vessell slides the watry lay, Without the blast, or tug, of wind, or Oare; Her slippry keele divides the silver foame With ease; So facile is the way from home. 6 But when the home-bound vessell turnes her sailes Against the brest of the resisting streame, O then she slugs; nor Saile, nor Oare prevailes; The Streame is sturdy, and her Tides extreme: Each stroke is losse, and ev'ry Tug is vaine; A Boat-lengths purchase is a League of paine. 7 Great All in All, that art my Rest, my Home, My way is tedious, and my steps are slow; Reach forth thy helpfull hand, or bid me come; I am thy child; O teach thy Child to go: Conjoyne thy sweet commands to my desire, And I will venture, though I fall or tire. S. AUGUST. Ser. 15 de Verb. Apost. Be alwayes displeased at what thou art, if thou desirest to attaine to what thou art not: For where thou hast pleas'd thy selfe, there thou abidest: But if thou sayest, I have enough, thou perishest: Alwayes add, alwayes walke, alwayes proceed; neither stand still, nor go backe, nor deviate: He that stands still, proceeds not; He goes back, that continues not: He deviates, that revolts: He goes better that creepes, in his way, than he that runs, out of his way. EPIGRAM 3. [Feare not, my soule, to lose for want of cunning] Feare not, my soule, to lose for want of cunning; Weepe not; heav'n is not alwayes got by running: Thy thoughts are swift, although thy legs be slow; True love will creepe, not having strength to go. IV. PSALMS CXIX. CXX. My flesh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements. Let others boast of Luck: and go their wayes With their faire Game; Know, vengeance seldome playes, To be too forward; but does wisely frame Her backward Tables, for an After-Game: She gives thee leave to venture many a blot; And, for her owne advantage, hits thee not; But when her pointed Tables are made faire, That she be ready for thee, then beware; Then, if a necessary blot be set, She hits thee; wins the Game; perchance the Set: If prosperous Chances make thy Casting high, Be wisely temp'rate; cast a serious eye On after-dangers, and keep back thy Game; Too forward seed-times make thy Harvest lame: If left-hand Fortune give thee left-hand chances, Be wisely patient; let no envious glances Repine to view thy Gamesters heape so faire; The hindmost Hound takes oft the doubling Hare: The worlds great Dice are false; sometimes they goe Extremely high; sometimes, extremely low: Of all her Gamesters, he that playes the least, Lives most at ease; playes most secure, and best: The way to win, is to play faire, and sweare Thy selfe a servant to the Crowne of Feare: Feare is the Primmer of a Gamsters skill; Who feares not Bad, stands most unarm'd to Ill: The Ill that's wisely fear'd, is halfe withstood; And feare of Bad is the best foyle to Good: True Feare's th'Elixar, which, in dayes of old, Turn'd leaden Crosses into Crownes of Gold: The World's the Table; Stakes, Eternall life; The Gamesters, Heav'n and I; Unequall strife! My Fortunes are my Dice, whereby I frame My indisposed Life: This Life's the Game; My sins are sev'rall Blots, the Lookers on Are Angels; and in death, the Game is done: Lord, I'm a Bungler, and my Game does grow Still more and more unshap'd; my Dice run low: The Stakes are great; my carelesse Blots are many; And yet, thou passest by, and hitst not any: Thou art too strong; And I have none to guide me With the least Jogge; The lookers on deride me; It is a Conquest, undeserving Thee, To win a Stake from such Wormes as mee: I have no more to lose; If we persever, 'Tis lost; and, that, once lost, I'm lost for ever. Lord, wink at faults, and be not too severe, And I will play my Game, ere Feare has past her date: Whose blot being hit, then feares; feare's then, too late. S. BERN. Ser. 54 in Cant. There is nothing so effectuall to obtaine Grace, to retaine Grace, and to regaine Grace, as alwayes to be found before God not over-wise, but to feare: Happy art thou if thy heart be replenished with three feares, a feare for received Grace, a greater feare for lost Grace, a greatest feare to recover Grace. S. AUGUST. super Psalm. Present feare begets eternall security: Feare God, which above all, and no need to feare man at all. EPIGRAM 4. [Lord shall we grumble, when thy flames do scourge us?] Lord shall we grumble, when thy flames do scourge us? Our sinnes breath fire; that fire returnes to purge us: Lord, what an Alchymist art thou, whose skill Transmutes to perfect good, from perfect ill! V. PSALMS CXIX. XXXVII. Turne away mine eyes from regarding vanitie. 1 How like to threds of Flaxe That touch the flame, are my inflam'd desires! How like to yeelding Waxe, My soule dissolves before these wanton fires! The fire, but touch'd; the flame, but felt, Like Flaxe, I burne; like Waxe, I melt. 2 O how this flesh does draw My fetter'd soule to that deceitfull fire! And how th'eternall Law Is baffled by the law of my desire! How truly bad, how seeming good Are all the Lawes of Flesh and Blood! 3 O wretched state of Men, The height of whose Ambition is to borrow What must be paid agen, With griping Int'rest of the next dayes sorrow! How wild his Thoughts! How apt to range! How apt to varie! Apt to change! 4 How intricate, and nice Is mans perplexed way to mans desire! Sometimes upon the Ice He slips, and sometimnes fals into the fire; His progresse is extreme and bold, Or very hot, or very cold. 5 The common food, he doth Sustaine his soule-tormenting thoughts withall, Is honey, in his mouth, To night; and in his heart, to morrow, Gall; 'Tis oftentimes, within an houre, Both very sweet, and very sowre. 6 If sweet Corinna smile, A heav'n of Joy breaks downe into his heart: Corinna frownes a while? Hels Torments are but Copies of his smart: Within a lustfull heart does dwell A seeming Heav'n; a very Hell. 7 Thus worthlesse, vaine and void Of comforts, are the fruits of earths imployment; Which, ere they be enjoyd, Distract us; and destroy us in th'enjoyment; These be the pleasures that are priz'd, When heav'ns cheape pen'worth stands despis'd. 8 Lord, quench these hasty flashes, Which dart as ligtning from the thundring skies; And, ev'ry minit, dashes Against the wanton windowes of mine eyes: Lord, close the Casement, whilst I stand Behind the curtaine of thy Hand. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. Cap. 4. O thou Sonne that illuminates both Heaven and Earth: Woe be unto those eyes which do not behold thee: Woe be unto those blind eyes which cannot behold thee: Woe be unto those which turne away their eyes that they will not behold thee: Woe be unto those that turne not away their eyes that they may behold vanity. S. CHRYS. sup. Matth. 19 What is an evill woman but the enemy of friendship, an unavoidable paine, a necessary mischiefe, a naturall tentation, a desiderable calamity, a domestick danger, a delectable inconvenience, and the nature of evill painted over with the colour of good! EPIGRAM 5. ['Tis vaine, great God, to close mine eyes from ill] 'Tis vaine, great God, to close mine eyes from ill When I resolve to keep the old man still: My rambling heart must cov'nant first with Thee, Or none can passe betwixt mine eyes and me. VI. ESTHER VII. III. If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it please the King, let my life be given me at my petition. Thou art the great Assuerus, whose command Doth stretch from Pole to Pole; The World's thy land; Rebellious Vashti's the corrupted Will, Which being cal'd, refuses to fulfill Thy just command: Hester, whose teares condole The razed City's the Regen'rate Soule; A captive maid, whom thou wilt please to grace With nuptiall Honour in stout Vashti's place: Her kinsman, whose unbended knee did thwart Proud Hamans glory, is the Fleshly part: The sober Eunuch, that recal'd to mind The new-built Gibbet (Haman had divin'd For his owne ruine) fifty Cubits high, Is lustfull thought-controlling Chastity; Insulting Haman is that fleshly lust Whose red-hot fury, for a season, must Triumph in Pride, and study how to tread On Mordecay, till royall Hester plead: Great King, my sent-for Vashti will not come; O let the oyle o'th blessed Virgins wombe Cleanse my poore Hester; look, O looke upon her With gracious eyes; and let thy Beames of honour So scoure her captive staines, that she may prove A holy Object of thy heav'nly love: Annoint her with the Spiknard of thy graces, Then try the sweetnese of her chast embraces; Make her the partner of thy nuptiall Bed, And set thy royall Crowne upon her head: If then, ambitious Haman chance to spend His spleene on Mordecay, that scornes to bend The wilfull stiffenesse of his stubborne knee, Or basely crouch to any Lord but Thee; If weeping Hester should preferre a Grone Before the high Tribunall of thy Throne, Hold forth thy golden Scepter, and afford The gentle Audience of a gracious Lord: And let thy royall Hester be possest Of halfe thy kingdome, at her deare request; Curbe lustfull Haman; him, that would disgrace, Nay ravish thy faire Queene before thy face: And as proud Haman was himselfe ensnar'd On that selfe Gibbet, that himself prepar'd So nayle my lust, both Punishment, and Guilt On that deare Crosse that mine owne Lusts have built. S. AUGUST. in Ep. O holy Spirit, alwayes inspire me with holy works; constraine me, that I may doe: Counsell me that I may love thee: Confirme me, that I may hold thee; Conserve me that I may not lose thee. S. AUGUST. sup. Ioan. The Spirit rusts where the flesh rests: For as the flesh is nourished with sweet things, the Spirit is refreshed with sowre. Ibid. Wouldst thou that thy flesh obey thy Spirit? Then let thy Spirit obey thy God: Thou must be govern'd, that thou mayst governe. EPIGRAM 6. [Of Merc' and Justice is thy Kingdome built] Of Merc' and Justice is thy Kingdome built; This plagues my Sin; and that removes my guilt: When ere I sue, Assuerus like decline Thy Scepter; Lord, say, Halfe my kingdome's thine. VII. CANTICLES VII. XI. Come my beloved, let us goe forth into the fields, and let us remaine in the villages. Christ. Soule. Christ: Come, come, my deare, and let us both retire And whiffe the dainties of the fragrant fields: Where warbling Phil'mel and the shrill-mouth'd Quire Chaunt forth their raptures; where the Turtle builds Her lonely nest; and where the new-borne Bryer Breaths forth the sweetnesse that her Aprill yeelds: Come, come, my lovely faire, and let us try These rurall delicates; where thou and I May melt in private flames, and feare no stander by. Soule: My hearts eternall Joy, in lieu of whom The earth's a blast, and all the world, a Buble; Our Citie-mansion is the fairer Home, But Country-sweets are tang'd with lesser Trouble; Let's try them both, and choose the better; Come; A change in pleasure makes the pleasure double: On thy Commands depends my Goe, or Tarie; Ile stirre with Martha; or Ile stay with Marie: Our hearts are firmly fixt, although our pleasures varie. Christ: Our Country-Mansion (situate on high) With various Objects, still renewes delight; Her arched Roofe's of unstain'd Ivory; Her wals of fiery-sparkling Chrysolite; Her pavement is of hardest Porphery; Her spacious windowes are all glaz'd with bright And flaming Carbuncles; no need require Titans faint rayes, or Vulcans feeble fire; And ev'ry Gate's a Pearle; and ev'ry Pearle, entire. Soule: Foole, that I was! how were my thought deceiv'd! How falsly was my fond conceit possest! I tooke it for an Hermitage, but pav'd And daub'd with neighbring dirt, and thatch'd at best; Alas, I nev'r expected more, nor crav'd; A Turtle hop'd but for a Turtles nest: Come, come, my deare, and let no idle stay Neglect th'advantage of the head-strong day; How pleasure grates, that feeles the Curb of dull delay! Christ: 5Come, then my Joy; let our divided paces Conduct us to our fairest Territory; O there wee'l twine our soules in sweet embraces; Soule: And in thine Armes Ile tell my passion story: Christ: O there Ile crowne thy head with all my Graces; Soule: And all those Graces shall reflect thy Glory; Christ: O there, Ile feed thee with celestiall Manna; Ile be thy Elkanah. Soule: And I thy Hanna. Christ: Ile sound my Trump of Joy. Soule: And Ile resound Hosanna. S. BERN. O blessed Contemplation! The death of vices, and the life of virtues! Thee the Law and Prophets admire: Who ever attain'd perfection, if not by Thee! O blessed solitude, the Magazine of celestiall Treasure: by thee things earthly, and transitory, are chang'd into heavenly, and eternall. S. BERN. in Ep. Happy is that house, and blessed is that Congregation, where Martha still complaines of Mary. EPIGRAM 7. [Mechanick soule; thou must not only doe] Mechanick soule; thou must not only doe With Martha; but, with Mary, ponder too: Happy's that house, where these faire sisters vary; But most, when Martha's reconcil'd to Mary. VIII. CANTICLES I. III. Draw me; we will follow after thee by the savour of thy Oyntment. Thus, like a lump of the corrupted Masse, I lie secure; long lost, before I was: And like a Block, beneath whose burthen lies That undiscover'd Worme that never dies, I have no will to rouze; I have no pow'r to rise. Can stinking Lazarus compound, or strive With deaths entangling Fetters, and revive? Or can the water-buried Axe implore A hand to raise it? or, it selfe, restore And, from her sandy deepes, approach the dry-foot shore, So hard's the task for sinfull flesh and Blood To lend the smallest step to what is Good; My God, I cannot move, the least degree; Ah! If but onely those that active be None should thy glory see, none should thy Glory see. But if the Potter please t'informe the Clay; Or some strong hand remove the Block away; Their lowly fortunes soone are mounted higher, That proves a vessell, which, before, was myre; And this, being hewne, may serve for better use than fire. And if that life-restoring voice command Dead Laz'rus forth; or that great Prophets hand Should charme the sullen waters, and begin To beckon, or to dart a Stick but in, Dead Laz'rus must revive, and th'Axe must float agin. Lord, as I am, I have no pow'r at all To heare thy voice, or Eccho to thy call; The gloomy Clouds of mine owne Guilt benight me; Thy glorious beames, nor dainty sweets invite me; They neither can direct; nor these at all delight me. See how my Sin-bemangled body lies, Nor having pow'r, to will; nor will, to rise! Shine home upon thy Creature, and inspire My livelesse will with thy regen'rate fire; The first degree to do, is onely to desire. Give me the pow'r to will; the will, to doe; O raise me up, and I will strive to go. Draw me, O draw me with thy treble twist, That have no pow'r but meerely to resist; O lend me strength to do; and then command thy List. My Soule's a Clock, whose wheeles (for want of use And winding up, being subject to th'abuse Of eating Rust) wants vigour to fulfill Her twelve houres task, and show her makers skill; But idly sleepes unmoov'd, and standeth vainly still. Great God, it is thy work: and therefore, Good; If thou be pleas'd to cleanse it with thy Blood; And winde it up with thy soule-mooving kayes, Her dusie wheeles shall serve thee all her dayes; Her Hand shall point thy pow'r; her Hammer strike thy praise. S. BERN. Serm. 21 in Cant. Let us run: let us run, but in the savour of thy Oyntments, not in the confidence of our merits, nor in the greatnesse of our strength: we trust to run, but in the multitude of thy mercies, for though we run and are willing, it is not in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but in God that sheweth mercy: O let thy mercy returne, and we will run: Thou, like a Gyant, run'st by thy own power; We, unlesse thy oyntment breath upon us, cannot run. EPIGRAM 8. [Looke not, my Watch, being once repair'd, to stand] Looke not, my Watch, being once repair'd, to stand Expecting motion from thy Makers hand. H'as wound thee up, and cleans'd thy Coggs with blood: If now thy wheeles stand still; thou art not good. IX. CANTICLES VIII. I. O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the brest of my mother, I would find thee without, and I would kisse thee. 1 Come, come my blessed Infant, and immure thee Within the Temple of my sacred Armes; Secure mine Armes; mine Armes shall, then, secure thee From Herods fury, or the High Priests Harmes; Or if thy danger'd life sustaine a losse, My folded Armes shall turne they dying Crosse. 2 But, ah, what savage Tyrant can behold The beauty of so sweet a face as this is, And not himselfe, be, by himselfe, controld, And change his fury to a thousand kisses? One smile of thine is worth more mines of treasure Than there by Myriads in the days of Caesar. 3 O, had the Tetrarch, as he knew thy birth, So knowne thy Stock; he had not sought to paddle In thy deare Blood; but, prostrate on the earth, Had vayld his Crowne before thy royall Cradle, And laid the Scepter of his Glory downe, And beg'd a heav'nly for an earthly Crowne. 4 Illustrious Babe! How is thy Handmaid grac'd With a rich Armefull! How doest thou decline Thy Majesty, that wert, so late, embrac'd In thy great Fathers Armes, and now, in mine! How humbly gracious art thou, to refresh Me with thy Spirit, and assume, my flesh. 5 But must the Treason of a Traitors Haile Abuse the sweetnesse of these rubie lips? Shall marble-hearted Cruelty assaile These Alabaster sides with knotted whips? And must these smiling Roses entertaine The Blowes of scorne, and Flurts of base disdaine? 6 Ah! must these dainty little sprigs that twine So fast about my neck, be pierc'd and torne With ragged nailes? And must these Browes resigne Their Crowne of Glory for Crowne of thorne? Ah, must this blessed Infant tast the paine Of deaths injurious pangs? nay worse; be slaine? 7 Sweet Babe! At what deare rates do wretched I Commit a sin! Lord, ev'ry sin's a dart; And ev'ry trespasse lets a javelin fly; And ev'ry javelin wounds thy bleeding heart: Pardon, sweet Babe, what I have done amisse, And seale that granted pardon with a kisse. BONAVENT. Soliloq. Cap. 1. O sweet Jesu, I knew not that thy kisses were so sweet, nor thy society so delectable, nor thy Attraction so vertuous: For when I love thee, I am cleane: when I touch thee, I am chast; when I receive thee, I am a virgin: O most sweet Jesu, thy embraces defile not, but cleanse; thy attraction pollutes not, but sanctifies: O Jesu, the fountaine of universall sweetnesse, pardon me, that I believed so late, that so much sweetnesse is in thy embraces. EPIGRAM 9. [My burthen's greatest: Let not Atlas bost] My burthen's greatest: Let not Atlas bost: Impartiall Reader, judge, which beares the most: He beares but Heav'n; My folded Armes sustaine Heav'ns Maker; whom heav'ns heav'n cannot containe. X. CANTICLES XXX. I. In my bed, by night, I sought him, that my soule loved: I sought him, but I found him not. The learned Cynick, having lost the way To honest men, did, in the height of day, By Taper-light, divide his steps about The peopled Streets, to find this dainty out; But fail'd. The Cynick search'd not where he ought; The thing he sought for was not where he sought: The Wisemens taske seem'd harder to be done, The Wisemen did, by Starre-light seeke the Son, And found; the Wisemen search'd it where they ought; The thing they hop'd to find, was where they sought: One seeks his wishes where he should; but then Perchance he seeks not where he should, nor when: Another searches when he should, but there He failes; not seeking as he should, nor where: Whose soule desires the good it wants; and would Obtaine, must seek Where, As, and When he should: How often have my wilde Affections led My wasted soule to this my widdow'd Bed, To seeks my Lover, whom my soule desires! (I speak not, Cupid, of thy wanton fyres; Thy fires are all but dying sparks to mine; My flames are full of heav'n, and all divine) How often have I sought this Bed, by night, To find that greater, by this lesser light! How oft has my unwitnest groanes lamented Thy deares absence! Ah, how often vented The bitter Tempests of despairing breath, And tost my soule upon the waves of death! How often has my melting heart made choice Of silent teares, (teares lowder than a voice) To plead my griefe, and woo thy absent eare! And yet thou wilt not come; thou wilt not heare: O is thy wonted love become so cold? Or do mine eyes not seeks thee where they should? Why do I seek thee, if thou art not here? Or find thee not, if thou art ev'rywhere? I see my error; 'Tis not strange I could not Find out my love; I sought him where I should not: Thou art not found in downy Beds of ease; Alas, thy musick strikes on harder keyes: Nor art thou found by that false, feeble light Of Natures Candle; Our Aegyptian night Is more than common darknesse; nor can we Expect a morning, but what breaks from Thee. Well may my empty Bed bewaile thy losse, When thou art lodg'd upon thy shamefull Crosse: If thou refuse to share a Bed with me; Wee'l never part, Ile share a Crosse with Thee. ANSELM. in Protolog. Cap. 1. Lord, if thou art not present, where shall I seeke thee absent? If every where, why do I not see thee present? Thou dwellest in light inaccessible; and where is that inaccessible light? Or how shall I have accesse to light inaccessible? I beseech thee, Lord, teach me to seeke thee, and show thyselfe to the seeker, because I can neither seeke thee, unlesse thou teach me, nor find thee, unlesse thou show thyselfe to me: Let me seeke the, in desiring thee, and desire thee in seeking thee: Let me find thee in loving thee, and love thee in finding thee. EPIGRAM 10. [Where shouldst thou seek for rest, but in thy Bed?] Where shouldst thou seek for rest, but in thy Bed? But now thy Rest is gone; thy Rest is fled: 'Tis vaine to seeke him there; My soule, be wise; Go ask thy sinnes; They'l tell thee where he lies. XI. CANTICLES III. II. I will rise, and go about the City, and will seeke him that my soule loveth: I sought him, but I found him not. 1 O how my disappointed soule's perplext! How restlesse thoughts swarme in my troubled brest! How vainly pleas'd with hopes; then crossly vext With feares! And how, betwixt them both, distrest! What place is left unransack'd? Oh! Where, next, Shall I go seek the Author of my Rest? Of what blest Angell shall my lips enquire The undiscover'd way to that entire And everlasting solace of my hearts desire! 2 Look how the stricken Hart, that wounded, flies Ov'r hills and dales, and seeks the lower grounds For running streames; the whil'st his weeping eyes Beg silent mercy from the following Hounds, At length, embost, he droopes, drops downe, and lies Beneath the burthen of his bleeding wounds: Ev'n so my gasping soule, dissolv'd in teares, Doth search for thee, my God, whose deafned eares Leave me th'unransom'd Prisner to my panick feares. 3 Where have my busie eyes not pry'd? O where, Of whom hath not my thred-bare tongue demanded? I search'd this glorious City; Hee's not here; I sought the Countrey; She stands empty-handed: I search'd the Court; He is a stranger there: I ask'd the land; Hee's shipp'd: the sea; hee's landed: I climb'd the ayre, my thoughts began t'aspire; But, ah! the wings of my too bold desire, Soaring too neare the Sun, were sing'd with sacred fire. 4 I moov'd the Merchants eare; alas, but he Knew neither what I said, nor what to say: I ask'd the Lawyer; He demands a Fee, And then demurres me with a vaine delay: I ask'd the Schoole-man; His advice was free, But scor'd me out too intricate a way; I ask'd the Watch-man (best of all the foure) Whose gentle answer could resolve no more; But that he lately left him at the Temple doore. 5 Thus having sought, and made my great Inquest In ev'ry place, and search'd in ev'ry eare; I threw me on my Bed; but ah! my rest Was poyson'd with th'extreames of griefe and feare, Where, looking downe into my troubled brest, The Magazen of wounds, I found him there; Let others hunt, and show their sportfull Art; I wish to catch the Hare before the start, As Potchers use to do; Heav'ns Form's a troubled heart. S. AMBROS. Lib. 3 de Virg. Christ is not in the market; not in the streets: For Christ is peace; in the market are strifes: Christ is Justice: in the market is iniquity: Christ is a Labourer; in the market is idlenesse: Christ is Charity; in the market is slander: Christ is Faith; in the market is fraud: Let us not therefore seeke Christ, where we cannot find Christ. S. HIEROM. Ep. 22 Eustoch. Jesus is jealous: He will not have thy face seene: Let foolish virgins ramble abroad; seeke thou thy Love at home. EPIGRAM 11. [What lost thy Love? Will neither Bed nor Board] What lost thy Love? Will neither Bed nor Board Receive him? Not by teares to be implor'd It is the Ship that mooves, and not the Coast; I feare, I feare, my soule, 'tis thou art lost. XII. CANTICLES III. III. Have you seene him whom my soule loveth? When I had past a little from them, then I found him, I took hold on him, and left him not. 1 What secret corner? What unwonted way Has scap'd the ransack of my rambling thoughts? The Fox by night, nor the dull Owle, by day, Have never search'd those places I have sought, Whilst thy lamented absence taught my brest The ready Road to Griefe, without request; My day had neither comfort, nor my night had rest: 2 How has my unregarded language vented The sad Tautologies of lavish passion? How often have I languish'd, unlamented! How oft have I complain'd without compassion! I asked the Citie-Watch; but some deny'd me The common streit, whilst others would misguide me; Some would debarre me; some, divert me; some, deride me. 3 Mark, how the widow'd Turtle, having lost The faithfull partner of her loyall Heart, Stretches her feeble wings from Coast to Coast, Haunts ev'ry path; thinks ev'ry shade does part Her absent Love, and her; At length, unsped, She re-betakes her to her lonely Bed, And there bewailes her everlasting widow-head; 4 So when my soule had progrest ev'ry place, That love and deare affection could contrive; I threw me on my Couch, resolv'd t'embrace A death for him, in whom I ceas'd to live: But there injurious Hymen did present His Landskip joyes; my pickled eyes did vent Full streames of briny teares; teares never to be spent. 5 Whilst thus my sorrow-wasting soule was feeding Upon the rad'call Humour of her thought, Ev'n whilst mine eyes were blind, and heart was bleeding, He that was sought, unfound, was found, unsought; As if the Sun should dart his Orbe of light Into the secrets of the black-brow'd night, Ev'n so appear'd my Love, my sole, my soules delight. 6 O how mine eyes, now ravish'd at the sight Of my bright Sun, shot flames of equall fire! Ah! how my soule, dissolv'd with ov'r-delight, To re-enjoy the Crowne of chaste desire! How sov'raigne joy depos'd and dispossest Rebellious griefe! And how my ravisht brest— But who can presse those heights, that cannot be exprest? 7 O how these Armes, these greedy Arms did twine, And strongly twist about his yeelding wast! The sappy branches of the Thespian vine Nev'r cling'd their lesse beloved Elme so fast; Boast not thy flames, blind boy, nor feather'd shot; Let Himens easie snarles be quite forgot: Time cannot quench our fires, nor death dissolve our knot. ORIG. Hom. 10 in divers. O most holy Lord, and sweetest Master, how good art thou to those that are of upright heart, and humble spirit! O how blessed are they that seek thee with a simple heart! How happy that trust in thee! It is a most certaine truth, that thou lovest all that love thee, and never forsakest those that trust in thee: For behold thy Love simply sought thee, and undoubtedly found thee: She trusted in thee, and is not forsaken of thee, but hath obtained more by thee, than she expected from thee. BEDE in Cap. 3. Cant. The longer I was in finding whom I sought, the more earnestly I held him being found. EPIGRAM 12. [What? found him out? Let strong embraces bind him] What? found him out? Let strong embraces bind him; Hee'l fly perchance, where teares can never find him: New Sins will lose what old Repentance gaines: Wisedome not onely gets, but got, retaines. XIII. PSALMS LXXII. XXVIII. It is good for me to draw neare to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God. Where is that Good, which wise men please to call The Chiefest? Does there any such befall Within mans reach? Or is there such a Good at all? If such there be: it neither must expire, Nor change; than which, there can be nothing higher; Such Good must be the utter point of mans desire: It is the Mark, to which all hearts must tend, Can be desired for no other end, Then for it selfe; on which, all other Goods depend: What may this Exc'lence be? does it subsist A royall Essence, clouded in the mist Of curious Art, or cleare to ev'ry eye that list? Or is't a tart Idea, to procure An Edge, and keep the practick soule in ure, Like that deare Chymick dust, or puzzling Quadrature? Where shall I seek this Good? Where shall I find This Cath'lick pleasure, whose extreames may bind My thouhts, and fill the gulph of my insatiate mind? Lies it in Treasure? In full heaps untold? Does gowty Mammons griping hand infold This secret Saint in sacred Shrines of sov'raigne Gold? No, no; she lies not there; Wealth often sowrs In keeping; makes us hers, in seeming ours; She slides from heav'n indeed, but not in Danaes showrs. Lives she in Honour? No. The royall Crowne Builds up a Creature, and then batters downe: Kings raise thee with a smile, and raze thee with a frowne. In pleasure? No, Pleasure begins in rage; Acts the fooles part on earths uncertaine Stage, Begins the Play in Youth; and Epilogues in Age. These, these are bastard-goods; the best of these Torment the soule with pleasing it, and please, Like water gulp'd in Fevers, with deceitfull ease. Earths flattring dainties are but sweet distresses: Mole-hils performe the mountaines she professes; Alas, can earth confer more good than earth possesses? Mount, mount my soule; and let thy thoughts casheire Earths vaine delights, and make their full careire At heav'ns eternall joyes, stop, stop thy Courser there. There shall thy soule possesse uncarefull Treasure; There shalt thou swim in never-fading pleasure; And blaze in Honour farre above the frownes of Caesar. Lord, if my hope dare let her Anchor fall On thee, the chiefest Good, no need to call For earths inferiour trash; Thou, thou art All in All. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. Cap. 13. I follow this thing, I pursue that; but am fill'd with nothing. But when I found thee, who art that immutable, individed, and onely good, in myselfe, what I obtained, I wanted not; for what I obtained not, I grieved not; with what I was possest, my whole desire was satisfied. S. BERN. Ser. 9 sup. beati qui habent, &amp;c. Let others pretend merit: let him brag of the burthen of the day; let him boast of his Sabbath fasts, and let him glory that he is not as other men: but for me, it is good to cleave unto the Lord, and to put my trust in my Lord God. EPIGRAM 13. [Let Boreas blasts, and Neptunes waves be joyn'd] Let Boreas blasts, and Neptunes waves be joyn'd, Thy Eolus commands the waves, the wind: Feare not the Rocks or worlds imperious waves: Thou climbst a Rock (my soule) a Rock that saves. XIV. CANTICLES II. III. I sate under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. 1 Look how the sheep, whose rambling steps doe stray From the safe blessing of her Shepheards eyes Eftsoone, becomes the unprotected Prey To the wing'd Squadron of beleagring flies; Where, sweltred with the scorching beames of day, She frisks from Bush to Brake; and wildly flies From her owne selfe, ev'n of her selfe affraid; She shrowds her troubled browes in ev'ry Glade, And craves the mercy of the soft removing shade. 2 Ev'n so my wandring Soule, that has digrest From her great Shepheard, is the hourely prey Of all my Sinnes, These vultures in my Brest Gripe my Promethian heart both night and day; I hunt from place to place, but find no rest; I know not where to go, nor where to stay: The eye of vengeance burnes; her flames invade My sweltring Soule: My soule has oft assaid But she can find no shrowd, but she can feele no Shade. 3 I sought the Shades of Mirth, to weare away My slow-pac'd houres of soule-consuming griefe; I search'd the Shades of Sleepe, to case my day Of griping sorrowes with a nights repriefe; I sought the Shades of Death; thought, there, t'allay My finall torments with a full reliefe; But Mirth, nor Sleepe, nor Death can hide my howres In the false Shades of their deceitfull Bowres; The first distracts, the next disturbes, the last devoures. 4 Where shall I turne? To whom shall I apply me? Are there no Streames where a faint soule may wade? Thy Godhead, JESUS, are the flames that fry me; Has thy All-glorious Deity nev'r a Shade, Where I may sit, and vengeance never eye me, Where I might sit refresht, or unaffraid? Is there no Comfort? Is there no Refection? Is there no Covert that will give Protection T'a fainting soule, the subject of thy wraths reflexion? 5 Looke up, my soule; advance the lowly stature Of thy sad Thoughts; advance thy humble eye: See, here's a Shadow found; The humane nature Is made th'Umbrella to the Deity, To catch the Sun-beames of thy just Creator; Beneath this Covert thou maist safely lie: Permit thine eyes to climbe this fruitfull Tree, As quick Zacheus did, and thou shalt see A Cloud of dying flesh betwixt those Beames and thee. GUILL. in Cap. 2 Cant. Who can endure the fierce rayes of the Sun of Justice? Who shall not be consumed by his beames? Therefore the Sun of Justice took flesh, that through the conjunction of that Sun and this humane, body, a shadow may be made. S. AUGUST. Med. Cap. 37. Lord, let my soule flee from the scorching thoughts of the world under the Covert of thy wings, that being refreshed by the moderation of thy shadow, she may sing merrily. In peace will I lay me downe and rest. EPIGRAM 14. [Ah, treach'rous soule, would not thy Pleasures give] Ah, treach'rous soule, would not thy Pleasures give That Lord which made thee living, leave to live? See, what thy sinnes have done: Thy sinnes have made The Sun of Glory now become thy Shade. XV. PSALMS CXXXXVII. IV. How shall we sing a song of the Lord in a strange land? Urge me no more: This Ayry mirth belongs To better times: These times are not for songs: The sprightly Twang of the melodious Lute Agrees not with my voice: and both unsuit My untun'd fortunes: The affected measure Of straines that are constrain'd, affoord no pleasure; Musick's the Child of mirth: where griefs assaile The troubled soule, both voice and fingers faile; Let such as ravill out their lavish dayes In honourable Ryot; that can raise Dejected hearts, and conjure up a Sprite Of madnesse by the Magick of delight; Let those of Cupids Hospitall that lie Impatient Patients to a smiling eye, That cannot rest, untill vaine hope beguile Their flatter'd Torments with a wanton smile; Let such redeeme their peace, and salve the wrongs Of froward Fortune with their frolick Songs: My grief, my grief's too great for smiling eyes To cure, or Counter-charmes to exercise; The Ravens dismall Croakes; the midnight howles Of empty Wolves, mixt with the screech of Owles; The nine sad knowles of a dull Passing Bell, With the loud language of a nighty knell, And horrid out-cries of revenged Crimes, Joyn'd in a Medley's Musick for these Times; These are no Times to touch the merry string Of Orpheus; No, these are no times to sing: Can hide-bound Prisners, that have spent their soules And famish'd Bodies in the noysome holes Oh hell-black dungeons, apt their rougher throats, Growne hoarse with begging Almes, to warble notes? Can the sad Pilgrim, that has lost his way In the vast desarts; there, condemn'd a Prey To the wild Subject, or his Salvage King, Rouze up his palsey-smitten spir'ts, and sing? Can I a Pilgrim, and a Prisner too, (Alas) where I am neither knowne, nor know Ought but my Torments, an unransom'd stranger In this strange Climat, in a land of danger, O, can my voice be pleasant, or my hand, Thus made a Prisner to a forreigne land? How can my musick relish in your eares, That cannot speake for sobs, nor sing for teares? Ah, if my voice could, Orpheus-like, unspell My poore Euridice, my soule, from hell Of earths miscontru'd Heav'n, O then my brest Should warble Ayres, whose Rapsodies should feast The eares of Seraphims, and entertaine Heav'ns highest Deity with their lofty straine, A straine well drencht in the true Thespian Well: Till then; earths Semiquaver, mirth, farewell. S. AUGUST. Med. Cap. 33. O infinitely happy are those heavenly virtues which are able to praise thee in holinese and purity, with excesssive sweetnesse and inutterable exultation! From thence they praise thee, from whence they rejoyce, for what they praise thee: But wee prest downe with this burthen of flesh, farre remov'd from thy countenance in this pilgrimage, and blowne up with worldly vanities, cannot worthily praise thee: We praise thee by faith; not face to face; but those Angelicall Spirits praise thee face to face, and not by faith. EPIGRAM 15. [Did I refuse to sing? Said I these times] Did I refuse to sing? Said I these times Were not for Songs? nor musick for thee Climes? It was my Errour: Are not Groanes and teares Harmonious Raptures in th'Almighties eares? THE FIFT BOOK. I. CANTICLES V. VIII. I charge you, O daughter of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am sick of love. 1 You holy Virgins, that so oft surround The Cities Saphyre Wals, whose snowy feet Measure the pearly Paths of sacred, ground, And trace the new Jerus'lems Jasper street; Ah, you whose care-forsaken hearts are crown'd With your best wishes; that enjoy the sweet Of all your Hopes; If ere you chance to spie My absent Love, O tell him that I lie Deep wounded with the flames, that furnac'd from his eye. 2 I charge you, Virgins, as you hope to heare The heav'nly Musick of your Lovers voice; I charge you by the solemne faith ye beare To plighted vowes, and to the loyall choice Of your Affections; or, if ought more deare You hold; by Hymen; by your marriage joyes, I charge you, tell him, that a flaming dart, Shot from his Eye, hath pierc'd my bleeding heart; And I am sick of love, and languish in my smart. 3 Tell him, O tell him, how my panting brest Is scorch'd with flames, and how my soule is pin'd; Tell him, O tell him, how I lie opprest With the full torments of a troubled mind; O tell him, tell him, that he loves in jest, But I, in earnest; Tell him, hee's unkind: But if a discontented frowne appeares Upon his angry Brow, accoast his eares With soft and fewer words, and act the rest in teares. 4 O tell him, that his cruelties deprive My soule, of peace, while peace, in vaine, she seeks; Tell him, those Damask roses, that did strive, With white, both fade upon my sallow cheeks; Tell him, no token does proclaime I live, But teares, and sighs, and sobs, and sudden shreeks; Thus if your piercing words should chance to bore His harkning eare, and move a sigh, give ore To speak; and tell him—Tell him, that I could do no more. 5 If your elegious breath should hap to rouze A happy teare, close harb'ring in his eye, The urge his plighted faith, the sacred vowes, Which neither I can break, nor He deny; Bewaile the Torments of his loyall Spouse, That for his sake, would make a sport to die: O blessed Virgins, how my passion tires Beneath the burthen of her vaine desires! Heav'n never shot such flames, Earth never felt such fires. S. AUGUST. Med. cap. 40. What shall I say? What shall I doe? Whether shall I goe? Where shall I seek him? Or when shall I find him? Whom shall I ask? Who will tell my beloved that I am sick of love? GULIEL. in Cap. 5. Cant. I live; But not I: It is my beloved that lives in me: I love my selfe, not with my owne love, but with the love of my beloved, that loves me: I love not my selfe in my selfe, but my selfe in him, and him in me. EPIGRAM 1. [Grieve not (my soule) nor let thy love waxe faint] Grieve not (my soule) nor let thy love waxe faint, Weepst thou to lose the cause of thy Complaint? Hee'l come; Love nev'r was bound to the Times nor Lawes: Till then, thy teares complaine without Cause. II. CANTICLES II. V. Stay me with Flowers, and comfort me with Apples, for I am sicke with love. 1 O Tyrant love! how does thy sev'raigne pow'r Subject poore soules to thy imperious thrall! They say, thy Cup's compos'd of sweet and sowre; They say, thy diet's Honey, mixt with Gall; How comes it then to passe, these lips of our Still trade in bitter; taste no sweet at all? O tyrant love! Shall our perpetuall toyle Nev'r find a Sabbath, to refresh, a while, Our drooping soules? Art thou all frowns, and nev'r a smile? 2 You blessed Maids of Honour, that frequent The royall Courts of our renown'd JEHOVE, With Flow'rs restore my spirits faint, and spent; O fetch me Apples from Loves fruitfull Grove, To coole my palat, and renew my sent, For I am sick, for I am sick of Love: These, will revive my dry, my wasted pow'rs, And they, will sweeten my unsav'ry houres; Resfresh me then with Fruit, and comfort me with Flow'rs. 3 O bring me Apples to asswage that fire, Which, Aetna-like, inflames my flaming brest; Nor is it ev'ry Apple I desire, Nor that which pleases ev'ry Palat best: 'Tis not the lasting Deuzan I require, Nor yet the red-cheek'd Queening I request; Nor that which, first, beshrewd the name of wife, Nor that whose beauty caus'd the gold strife: No, no, bring me an Apple from the Tree of life. 4 Virgins, tuck up your silken laps, and fill ye With the faire wealth of Floras Magazine; The purple Vy'let, and the pale-fac'd Lilly; The Pauncy and the Organ Columbine; The flowring Thyme, the gilt-boule Daffadilly; The lowly Pinck, the lofty Eglentine: The blushing Rose, the Queene of Flow'rs, and best Of Floras beauty; but, above the rest, Let Jesses sov'raigne Flow'r perfume my qualming brest. 5 Haste, Virgins, haste; for I lie weake and faint, Beneath the pangs of love; why stand ye mute; As if your silence neither car'd to grant, Nor yet your languagre to deny my suit? No key can lock the doore of my complaint, Untill I smell this Flow'r, or taste that Fruit; Go, Virgins, seek this Tree, and search that Bow'r; O, how my soule shall blesse that happy houre, That brings to me such fruit, that brings me such a Flow'r! GISTEN. in Cap. 2 Cant. Expos. 3. O happy happy sicknesse! where the infirmity is not to death, but to life, that God may be glorified by it: O happy fever, that proceeds not from a consuming, but a calcining fire! O happy distemper, wherein the soule relishes no earthly things, but onely savours divine nourishment! S. BERN. Serm. 51 in Cant. By flowers understand faith; by fruit, good works: As the flower or blossome is before the fruit, so is faith before good works: So neither is the fruit without the flower, nor good works without faith. EPIGRAM 2. [Why Apples, O my soule? Can they remove] Why Apples, O my soule? Can they remove The Pangs of Griefe, or ease the flames of love? It was that Fruit which gave the first offence; That sent him hither; that remov'd him hence. III. CANTICLES II. XVI. My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth among the Lillies. 1 Ev'n like two little bank-dividing brookes, That wash the pebles with their wanton streames, And having rang'd and search'd a thousand nookes, Meet both at length, in silver-brested Thames; Where, in a greater Current they conjoyne; So I my Best-Beloveds am; so, He is mine. 2 Ev'n so we met; and after long pursuit, Ev'n so we joyn'd; we both became entire; No need for either to renew a Suit, For I was Flax, and he was Flames of fire: Our firm united soules did more than twine; So I my Best-Beloveds am; so He is mine. 3 If all those glittring Monarchs that command The servile Quarters of this earthly Ball, Should tender, in Exchange, their shares of land, I would not change my Fortunes for them all: Their wealth is but a Counter to my Coyne; The world's but theirs; but my Beloved's mine. 4 Nay, more; If the faire Thespian Ladies, all Should heap together their diviner treasure: That Treasure should be deem'd a price too small To buy a minuts Lease of half my Pleasure; 'Tis not the sacred wealth of all the Nine Can buy my heart from Him; or His, from being mine. 5 Nor Time, nor Place, nor Chance, nor Death can bow My least desires unto the least remove; Hee's firmly mine by Oath; I, His, by Vow; Hee's mine by Faith; and I am His by Love; Hee's mine by Water; I am His, by Wine; Thus I my Best-Beloveds am; Thus He is mine. 6 He is my Altar; I, his Holy Place; I am his Guest; and he, my living Food; I'm his, by Poenitence; He, mine by Grace; I'm his, by Purchace; He is mine, by Blood; Hee's my supporting Elme; and I, his Vine: Thus I my Best-Beloveds am. Thus He is mine. 7 He gives me wealth: I give him all my Vowes: I give Him songs; He gives me length of dayes; With wreathes of Grace he crownes my conq'ring browes: And I, his Temples, with a Crowne of Praise, Which he accepts as an everlasting signe, That I my Best-Beloveds am; and He is mine.

O my soule stampt with the Image of thy God; love him, of whom thou art so much beloved: Bend to him that bowes to thee, seeke him that seeks thee: Love thy lover, by whose love thou art prevented, being the cause of thy love: Be carefull with those that are carefull, want with those that want; Be cleane with the cleane, and holy with the holy: Choose this friend above all friends, who, when all are taken away, remaines onely faithfull to thee: In the day of thy buriall, when all leave thee, he will not deceive thee, but defend thee from the roaring Lions, prepared for their prey. EPIGRAM 3. [Sing Hymen to my soule: What? lost and found] Sing Hymen to my soule: What? lost and found, Welcom'd, espous'd, enjoy'd so soone, and crown'd!

I am my Beloveds, and his desire is towards me. 1 Like to, the Artick needle, that does guide The wandring shade by his Magnetick pow'r, And leaves his silken Gnomon to decide The question of the controverted houre, First franticks up and downe, from side to side, And restlesse beats his christall'd Iv'ry case With vaine impatience; jets from place to place, And seeks the bosome of his frozen Bride, At length he slacks his motion, and does rest His trembling point at his bright Poles beloved Brest. 2 Ev'n so my soule, being hurried here and there; By ev'ry object that resents delight, Faine would be setled, but she knowes not where; She likes at morning what she loathes at night: She bowes to Honour; then, she lends an eare To that sweet Swan-like voice of dying Pleasure, Then tumbles in the scatter'd heapes of Treasure; Now flatter'd with false hope; now, foyl'd with Feare Thus finding all the worlds delights to be But empty toyes, good GOD, she point's alone to Thee. 3 But has the virtu'd Steele a pow'r to move? Or can the untouch'd Needle point aright? Or can my wandring Thoughts forbeare to rove, Unguided by the vertue of thy Spirit? O has my leaden Soule the Art t'improvre Her wasted Talent; and unrais'd, aspire In this sad moulting time of her desire? Not first belov'd have I the pow'r to love? I cannot stirre, but as thou please to move me, Nor can my heart returne thee love, untill thou love me. 4 The still Commandresse of the silent night Borrowes her beames from her bright brothers Eye; His faire Aspects fils her sharpe hornes with light, If he withdraw, her flames are quench'd and die; Ev'n so the beames of thy enlightning Sp'rite Infus'd and shot into my dark desire, Inflame my thoughts, and fill my soule with fire, That I am ravisht with a new delight; But if thou shrowd thy face, my glory fades, And I remaine a Nothing, all compos'd of shades. 5 Eternall God, O thou that onely art The sacred Fountaine of eternall light, And blessed Loadstone of my better part, O thou my hearts desire, my soules delight, Reflect upon my soule; and touch my heart, And then my heart shall prize no good above thee; And then my soule shall know thee; knowing, love thee; And then my trembling thoughts shall never start From thy commands, or swerve the least degree, Or once presume to move, but as they move in thee. S. AUGUST. Med. Cap, 25. If man can love man with so entire affection, that the one can scarce brooke the others absence; If a Bride can be joyned to her Bride-groome with so great an ardency of mind, that for the extremity of love she can enjoy no rest, nor suffring his absence without great anxiety with what affection, with what fervency ought the soule whom thou hast espoused by faith and compassion, to love thee her true God and glorious Bridegroom? EPIGRAM 4. [My soule; thy love is deare; 'Twas thought a good] My soule; thy love is deare; 'Twas thought a good And easie pen'worth of thy Saviours Blood: But be not proud; All matters rightly scan'd, 'Twas over-bought: 'Twas sold at second hand. V. CANTICLES V. VI. My Soule melted whilst my Beloved spake. Lord, has the feeble voice of flesh and blood The pow'r to work thine eares into a flood Of melted Mercy? or the strength, t'unlock The gates of Heav'n, and to dissolve a Rock Of marble Clouds into a morning show'r? To stop, or snatch a falling Thunderbolt From thy fierce hand, and make thy hand revolt From resolute Confusion, and instead Of Vyals, poure full Blessings on our head? Or shall the wants of famisht Ravens cry, And move thy mercy to a quick supply? Or shall the silent suits of drooping flowr's Woo thee for drops, and be refresh'd with Showr's? Alas, what marvell then, great GOD, what wonder If thy Hell-rouzing voice, that splits in sunder Thy brazen Portals of eternall death; What wonder if that life-restoring breath Which drag'd me from th'infernall shades of night, Should melt my ravisht soule with ore-delight? O can my frozen gutters choose but run, That feel the warmth of such a glorious Sun? Me thinks his language, like a flaming Arrow, Doth pierce my bones, and melts their wounded marrow; Thy flames O Cupid (though the joyfull heart Feeles neither tang of griefe, nor feares the smart Of jealous doubts, but drunk with full desires) Are torments weigh'd with these celestiall fires; Pleasures that ravish in so high a measure, That O I languish in excesse of pleasure: What ravisht heart, that feeles these melting Joyes, Would not despise and loathe the trech'rous Toyes Of dunghill earth! what soule would not be proud Of wry-mouth'd scornes, the worst that flesh and bloud Had rancor to devise? Who would not beare The worlds derision with a thankfull eare? What palat would refuse full bowles of spight, To gaine a minuts tast of such delight? Great spring of light, in whom there is no shade But what my interposing sinnes have made, Whose marrow-melting Fires admit no screene But what my owne rebellions put betweene Their precious flames, and my obdurate eare: Disperse these plague-distilling Clouds, and cleare My mungy Soule into a glorious day; Transplant this screene, remoove this Barre away; Then, then my fluent soule shall feele the fires Of thy sweet voice, and my dissolv'd desires Shall turne a sov'raigne Balsome, to make whole Those wounds my sinnes inlicted on thy soule. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. Cap. 34. What fire is this that so warmes my heart? What light is this that so enlightens my soule! O fire, that alwayes burnest, and never goest out, kindle me: O light, which ever shinest, and art never darkned, illuminate me: O that I had my heat from thee, most holy fire! How sweetly doest thou burne! How secretly dost thou shine! How desiderably doest thou inflame me! BONAVENT. Stim. amoris Cap. 8.

VI. PSALMS LXXIII. XXV. Whom have I in heav'n but Thee? and what desire I on earth in respect of Thee? 1 I love (and have some cause to love) the earth; She is my Makers Creature; therefore Good: She is my Mother; for shee gave me birth; She is my tender Nurse; she gives me food: But what a Creature, Lord, compar'd with Thee? Or what's my mother, or my nurse to me? 2 I love the Ayre; her dainty sweets refresh My drooping soule, and to new sweets invite me; Her shrill-mouth'd Quire sustaine me with their flesh, And with their Polyphonian notes delight me: But what's the Ayre, or all the sweets that she Can blesse my soule withall, compar'd to Thee? 3 I love the sea; She is my fellow-Creature; My carefull Purveyor; She provides me store; She wals me round; She makes my diet greater; She wafts my treasure from a forreigne shore; But Lord of Oceans, when compar'd with thee, What is the Ocean, or her wealth, to me? 4 To heav'ns high City I direct my Journey, Whose spangled Suburbs entertaine mine eye; Mine Eye, by Contemplations Great Atturney, Transcends the Christall pavement of the sky; But what is heav'n, great GOD, compar'd to Thee? Without Thy presence Heav'ns no Heav'n to me. 5 Without Thy presence Earth gives no Refection; Without Thy presence, Sea affords no treasure; Without Thy presence Ayre's a rank Infection; Without Thy presence Heav'ns selfe's no pleasure; If not possest, if not enjoy'd in Thee, What's Earth, or Sea, or Ayre, or Heav'n to me? 6 The highest Honours that the world can boast Are subjects farre too low for my desire; The brightest beames of glory are (at most) But dying sparkles of thy living fire: The proudest flames that earth can kindle, be But nightly Glow-wormes, if compar'd to Thee. 7 Without Thy presence, wealth are Bags of Cares; Wisdome, but Folly; Joy, disquiet sadnesse; Friendship is Treason, and Delights are snares; Pleasures but paine; and mirth, but pleasing Madnesse; Without Thee, Lord, things be not what they be, Nor have they being, when compar'd with Thee. 8 In having all things, and not Thee, what have I? Not having Thee, what have my labours got? Let me enjoy but Thee, what farther crave I? And having Thee alone what have I not? I wish nor Sea, nor Land; nor would I be Possest of Heav'n, Heav'n unpossest of Thee. BONAVENT. Cap. 1. Soliloq. Alas my God, now I understand (but blush to confesse) that the beauty of thy Creatures have deceived mine eyes; and I have not observed that thou art more amiable than all thy creatures; to which thou hast communicated but one drop of thy inestimable Beauty; For who hath adorned the heaven with Starres? Who hath stored the ayre with fowle? the waters, with fish? the earth, with plants and flowers? But what are all these, but a small spark of divine beauty. S. CHRYS. Hom. 5 in Ep. ad Rom.

Is Natures course dissolv'd? Does Times glasse stand? Or has some frolick heart set back the hand Of Fates pepetuall Clock? Wil't never strike? Is crazy Time growne lazy, faint, or sick With very Age? Or has that great Purroyall Of Adamantine sisters late made tryall Of some new Trade? Shall mortall hearts grow old In sorrow? Shall my weary Armes infold And underprop may panting sides for ever? Is there no charitable hand will sever My well-spun Thred, that my imprison'd soule May be deliver'd from this dull dark hole Of dungeon flesh? O shall I, shall I never Be ransom'd, but remaine a slave for ever? It is the Lot of man but once to die, But ere that death, how many deaths have I? To entertaine heav'ns joy? because conveigh'd By the hand of death? Will nakednesse refuse Rich change of robes, because the man's not spruise That bought them? Or will Poverty send back Full bags of gold, because the bringer's black? Life is Bubble, blowne with whining breaths, Fil'd with the torments of a thousand death's; Which, being prickt by death (while death deprives One life) presents the soule a thousand lives: O frantick mortal; how has earth bewitch'd Thy bedlam soule, which has so fondly pitch'd Upon her false delights! Delights, that cease Before enjoyment finds a time to please; Her fickle joyes breed doubtfull feares; her feares Being hopefull Griefes; her griefes weep fearfull teares, Tears coyne deceitfull hopes; hopes, carefull doubt, And surly passion justles passion out: To day, we pamper with a full repast Of lavish mirth; at night, we weepe as fast: To night we swim in wealth, and lend; To morrow, We sink in want, and find no friend to borrow: In what a Climat does my soule reside! Where pale-fac'd Murther, the first-borne of pride, Sets up her kingdome in the very smiles, And plighted faiths of men-like Crocadiles; A land, where each embroydred Sattin word Is lin'd with Fraud; where Mars his lawlesse sword Exiles Astraeas Balance; where that hand Now slayes his brother, that new-sow'd his land: O that my dayes of bondage would expire In this lewd Soyle! Lord, how my Soule's on fire To be dissolv'd! that I might once obtaine These long'd for joyes, long'd for, so oft, in vaine! If Moses-like, I may not live possest Of this faire land; LORD, let me see't, at least. S. AUGUST. Soliloq. Cap. 2. My life is a fraile life; a corruptible life; A life, which the more increases, the more decreases: The farther it goes, the nearer it comes to death: A deceitfull life, and like a shadow; full of the snares of death: Now I rejoyce; now I languish; now I flourish; now infirme; now I live, and straight I die; now I seeme happy, alwayes miserab; le, now I laugh, now I weepe: Thus all things are subject to mutability, that nothing continues an houre in one state: O Joy above Joy, exceeding all Joy, without which there is no Joy, when shall I enter into thee, that I may see my God that dwels in thee?

VIII. ROMANS VII. XXIV. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Behold thy darling, which thy lustfull care Pampers; for which thy restlesse thoughts prepare Such early Cates; For whom thy bubbling brow So often sweats, and bankrupt eyes do owe Such midnight scores to Nature, for whose sake Base earth is Sainted, the Infernall Lake Unfear'd; the Crowne of Glory poorely rated; Thy GOD neglected, and thy brother hated: Behold thy darling, whom thy soule affects So dearely; whom thy fond Indulgence decks And puppets up in soft, in silken weeds: Behold thy darling, whom thy fondnesse feeds With farre-fetch'd delicates, the deare-bought gaines Of ill-spent Time, the price of halfe thy paines: Behold thy darling, who, when clad by Thee, Derides thy nakednesse; and, when most free, Proclaimes her lover, slave; and, being fed Most full, then stikes th'indulgent Feeder dead: What meanst thou thus, my poore deluded soule, To love so fondly? Can the burning Cole Of thy Affection last without the fuell Of counter-love? Is thy Compere so cruell, And thou so kind, to love unlov'd againe? Canst thou sow favours, and thus reape disdaine? Remember, O remember thou art borne Of royall blood; remember, thou art sworne A Maid of Honour in the Court of Heav'n; Remember what a costly price was giv'n To ransome thee from slav'ry thou wert in; And wilt thou now, my soule, turne slave agin? The Son and Heire to Heav'ns triune JEHOVE Would faine become a suitor of thy Love, And offers for thy dow'r, his Fathers Throne, To sit for Seraphims to gaze upon; Hee'l give thee Honour, Pleasure, Wealth, and Things Transcending farre the Majesty of Kings: And wilt thou prostrate to the odious charmes Of this base Scullion? Shall his hollow Armes Hugg thy soft sides? Shall these course hands untie The sacred Zone of thy Virginitie? For shame, degen'rous soule, let thy desire Be quickned up with more heroick fire; Be wisely proud; let thy ambitious eye Read nobler objects; let thy thoughts defie Such am'rous basenesse; Let thy soule disdaine Th'ignoble profers of so base a Swaine; Or if thy vowes be past, and Himens bands Have ceremonyed your unequall hands, Annull, at least avoid thy lawlesse Act With insufficience, or a Praecontract: Or if the Act be good, yet maist thou plead A second Freedome; for the flesh is dead.

How am I joyned to this body, I know not; which when it is healthfull, provokes me to warre, and being damaged by warre, affects me with grief; which I both love as a fellow servant, and hate as an utter enemy: It is a pleasant foe, and a perfidious friend: O strange Conjunction and Alienation! What I feare I embrace, and what I love I am afraid of; Before I make warre, I am reconcil'd; Before I enjoy peace, I am at variance. EPIGRAM 8. [What need that House be daub'd with flesh and blood?] What need that House be daub'd with flesh and blood? Hang'd round with silks and gold; repair'd with food? Cost idly spent! That cost does but prolong Thy thraldome; Foole, thou mak'st thy Jayle too strong. IX. PHILIPPIANS I. XXIII. I am in a streight betweene two, having a desire to be dissolv'd, and to be with Christ. 1 What meant our carefull parents so to weare, And lavish out their ill expended houres, To purchase for us large possessions, here Which (though unpurchas'd) are too truly ours? What meant they, ah what meant they to indure Such loads of needlesse labour, to procure, And make that thing our own, which was our own too sure. 2 What meane these liv'ries and possessive kayes? What meane these bargaines, and these needlesse sales? What need these jealous, these suspitious wayes Of law-devis'd, and law-dissolv'd entailes? No need to sweat for gold; wherewith, to buy Estates of high-priz'd land; no need to tie Earth to their heires, were they but clog'd with earth as I. 3 O were their soules but clog'd with earth, as I, They would not purchase with so salt an Itch; They would not take, of Almes, what now they buy; Nor call him happy, whom the world counts rich: They would not take such paines, project and prog, To charge their shoulders with so great a log; Who has the greater lands, has but the greater clog. 4 I cannot do an act which earth disdaines not; I cannot think a thought which earth corrupts not; I cannot speake a word which earth prophanes not; I cannot make a vow earth interrupts not; If I but offer up an early groane, Or spread my wings to heav'ns long long'd for Throne She darkens my complaints, and drags my Offring downe. 5 Ev'n like the Hawlk, (whose keepers wary hands Have made a prisner to her wethring stock) Forgetting quite the pow'r of her fast bands, Makes a rank Bate from her forsaken Block, But her too faithfull Leash does soone restraine Her broken flight, attempted oft in vaine; It gives her loynes a twitch, and tugs her backe againe. 6 So, when my soule directs her better eye To heav'ns bright Pallace (where my treasure lies) I spread my willing wings, but cannot flie, Earth hales me downe, I cannot, cannot rise; When I but strive to mount the least degree, Earth gives a jerk, and foiles me on my knee; LORD, how my soule is rackt, betwixt the world and Thee. 7 Great GOD, I spread my feeble wings, in vaine; In vaine I offer my extended hands; I cannot mount till thou unlink my chaine; I cannot come till thou release my Bands: Which if thou please to break, and then supply My wings with spirit, th'Eagle shall not flie A pitch that's half so faire, nor half so swift as T. BONAVENT. Cap. 1. Soliloq. Ah sweet Jesus, pierce the marrow of my soule with the healthfull shafts of thy love, that it may truly burne, and melt, and languish with the onely desire of thee; that it may desire to be dissolv'd, and to be with thee: Let it hunger alone for the bread of life; let it thirst after thee, the spring and fountaine of eternall light, the streame of true pleasure: let it alwayes desire thee, seek thee, and find thee, and sweetly rest in thee.

My Soule is like a Bird; my Flesh, the Cage; Wherein, she weares her weary Pilgrimage Of houres as few as evill, daily fed With sacred Wine, and Sacramentall Bread; The keyes that locks her in, and lets her out, Are Birth, and Death; 'twixt both, she hopps about From perch to perch; from Sense to Reason; then, From higher Reason, downe to Sense agen: From Sense she climbes to Faith; where, for a season, She sits and sings; then, down againe to Reason; From Reason, back to Faith; and straight, from thence She rudely flutters to the Perch of Sense; From Sense, to Hope; then hopps from Hope to Doubt; From Doubt, to dull Despaire; there, seeks about For desp'rate Freedome; and at ev'ry Grate, She wildly thrusts, and begs th'untimely date Of unexpired thraldome, to release Th'afflicted Captive, that can find no peace: Thus am I coop'd within this fleshly Cage, I weare my youth, and waste my weary Age, Spending that breath which was ordain'd to chaunt Heav'ns praises forth, in sighs and sad complaint: Whilst happier birds can spread their nimble wing From Shrubs to Cedars, and there chirp and sing In choice of raptures, the harmonious story Of mans Redemption and his Makers Glory: You glorious Martyrs; you illustrious Troopes, That once were cloyster'd in your fleshly Coopes As fast as I, what Reth'rick had your tongues? What dextrous Art had your Elegiak Songs? What Paul-like pow'r had your admir'd devotion? What shackle-breaking Faith infus'd such motion To your strong Pray'rs, that could obtaine the boone To be inlarg'd, to be uncag'd so soone? When I (poore I) can sing my daily teares, Growne old in Bondage, and can find no eares: You great partakers of eternall Glory, That with your heav'n-prevailing Oratory, Releas'd your soules from your terrestriall Cage, Permit the passion of my holy Rage To recommend my sorrowes (dearely knowne To you, in dayes of old; and, once, your owne) To your best thoughts, (but oh't does not befit ye To moove our pray'rs; you love and joy; not pitie: Great LORD of soules, to whom should prisners flie, But Thee?

As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soule after thee O God. 1 How shall my tongue espresse that hallow'd fire Which heav'n has kindled in my ravisht heart! What Muse shall I invoke, that will inspire My lowly Quill to act a lofty part! What Art shall I devise t'expresse desire, Too intricate to be exprest by Art! Let all the nine be silent; I refuse Their aid in this high task, for they abuse The flames of Love too much: Assist me Davids Muse. 2 Not as the thirsty soyle desire soft showres, To quicken and refresh her Embrion graine; Nor as the drooping Crests of fading flowres Request the bounty of a morning Raine, Do I desire my GOD: These, in few houres, Re-wish, what late their wishes did obtaine, But as the swift-foot Hart, does, wounded, flie To th'much desired streames, ev'n so do I Pant after Thee, my GOD, whom, I must find, or die. 3 Before a Pack of deep-mouth'd Lusts I flee; O, they have singled out my panting heart, And wanton Cupid, sitting in a Tree, Hath pierc'd my bosome with a flaming dart; My soule being spent, for refuge, seeks to Thee, But cannot find where Thou my refuge art: Like as the swift-foot Hart does, wounded, flie To the desired streames, ev'n so do I Pant after Thee, my GOD, whom I must find, or die. 4 At length, by flight, I over-went the Pack; Thou drew'st the wanton dart from out my wound; The blood, that follow'd, left a purple track, Which brought a Serpent, but in shape, a Hound; We strove; He bit me; but thou brak'st his back, I left him grov'ling on th'envenom'd ground; But as the Serpent-bitten Hart does flie To the long-long'd for streames, ev'n so did I Pant after Thee, my GOD, whom I must find or die. 5 If lust should chafe my soule, made swift by fright, Thou art the streames where to my soule is bound: Or if a Jav'lin wound my sides, in flight, Thou art the Balsom, that must cure my wound: If poyson chance t'infest my soule, in sight, Thou art the Treacle that must make me sound; Ev'n as the wounded Hart, embost, does flie To th'streames extremely long'd for, so do I Pant after Thee, my GOD, whom I must find, or die.

What vantage can there be To soules of heav'n-descended Pedegree, More than to Beasts, that grovell? Are not they Fed by th'Almighties hand? and, ev'ry day, Fill'd with His Blessing too? Do they not see GOD in His creatures, as direct as we? Do they not tast Thee? heare Thee? nay, what Sense Is not partaker of Thine Excellence? What more do we? Alas, what serves our reason, But, like dark lanthornes, to accomplish Treason With greater closenesse? It affords no light, Brings Thee no nearer to our purblind sight; No pleassure rises up the least degree, Great GOD, but in the clearer view of Thee: What priv'ledge more than Sense, has Reason than? What vantage is it to be borne a man? How often has my patience built, (deare LORD) Vaine Tow'rs of Hope upon Thy gracious Word? How often has Thy Hope-reviving Grace Woo'd my suspitious eyes to seek Thy face! How often have I sought Thee? Oh how long Hath expectation taught my perfect tongue Repeated pray'rs, yet pray'rs could nev'r obtaine; In vaine I seek Thee, and I beg in vaine: If it be high presumption to behold Thy face, why didst Thou make mine eyes so bold To seek it? If that object be too bright For mans Aspect, why did thy lips invite Mine eye t'expect it? If it might be seene, Why is this envious curtaine drawne betweene My darkened eye and it? O tell me, why Thou dost command the thing Thou dost deny? Why dost thou give me so unpriz'd a treasure, And then deny'st my greedy soule the pleasure To view thy gift? Alas, that gift is void, And is no gift, that may not be enjoy'd: If those refulgent Beames of heav'ns great light Guild not the day, what is the day, but night? The drouzie Shepheard sleeps; flowres droop and fade; The Birds are sullen, and the Beast is sad; But if bright Titan art, his golden Ray, And, with his riches, glorifie the day, The jolly Shepheard pipes; Flowres freshly spring; The beast growes gamesome, and the birds they sing: Thou art my Sun, great GOD, O when shall I View the full beames of thy Meridian eye? Draw, draw this fleshly curtaine, that denies The gracious presence of thy glorious eyes; Or give me Faith; and, by the eye of Grace, I shall behold Thee, though not face to face. S.

O that I had the wings of a Dove, for then I would flee away and be at rest. 1 And am I sworne a dunghill slave for ever To earths base drudg'ry? Shall I never find A night of Rest? Shall my Indentures never Be cancel'd? Did injurious nature bind My soule earths Prentice, with no Clause, to leave her? No day of freedome? must I ever grinde? O that I had the pineons of a Dove That I might quit my Bands, and sore above And powre my just Complaints before the great JEHOVE! 2 How happy are the Doves, that have the pow'r, When ere they please, to spread their ayry wings! Or cloud-dividing Eagles, that can tow'r Above the Sent of these inferiour things! How happy is the Lark, that ev'ry howre, Leaves earth, and then for joy, mounts up and sings! Had my dull soule but wings as well as they, How I would spring from earth, and clip away, As wise Astraea did, and scorne this ball of Clay! 3 O how my soule would spurne this Ball of Clay, And loath the dainties of earths painfull pleasure! O how I'de laugh to see men night and day, Turmoyle, to gaine that Trash they call their treasure! O how I'de smile to see what plots they lay To catch the blast, or owne a smile from Caesar! Had I the pineons of a mounting Dove, How I would sore and sing, and hate the Love Of transitory Toyes, and feed on Joyes above! 4 There should I find that everlasting Pleasure, Which Change removes not, and which Chance prevents not; There should I find that everlasing Treasure Which force deprives not, fortune dis-augments not; There should I find that everlasting Caesar, Whose hand recals not, and whose heart repents not: Had I the pineons of a clipping Dove, How I would climbe the skies, and hate the Love Of transitory Toyes, and joy in Things above! 5 No rank-mouth'd slander, there, shall give offence, Or blast our blooming names, as here they doe; No liver-scalding Lust shall, there, incense Our boyling veines: There is no Cupids Bow: LORD, give my soule the milk-white Innocence Of Doves, and I shall have their pineons too: Had I the pineons of a sprightly Dove, How I would quit this earth, and sore above, And heav'ns blest kingdome find, with heav'ns blest King JEHOVE. S. AUGUST. in Psal. 138. What wings should I desire but the two precepts of love, on which the Law and the Prophets depend? O if I could obtaine these wings, I could fly from thy face to thy face, from the face of thy Justice to the face of thy Mercy: Let us find those wings by love which we have lost by lust. S. AUGUST. in Psal. 76. Let us cast off whatsoever hinders, entangles or burthens our flight untill we attaine that which satisfies: beyond which nothing is; beneath which, all things are; of which, all things are. EPIGRAM 13. [Tell me, my wishing soule, didst ever trie] Tell me, my wishing soule, didst ever trie How fast the wings of Red-crost Faith can flie? Why beg'st thou the the pineons of a Dove? Faiths wings are swifter, but the swiftest, Love. XIV. PSALMS LXXXIV. I. How amiable are thy Tabernacles O god of Hosts. Ancient of dayes, to whom, all things are Now, Before whose Glory, Seraphims do bow Their blushing Cheeks, and vale their blemisht faces: That, uncontaind, at once, dost fill all places, How glorious, O how farre beyond the height Of puzzled Quils, or the obtuse conceit Of flesh and Blood, or the too flat reports Of mortall tongues, are thy expreslesse Courts! Whose glory to paint forth with greater Art, Ravisht my Fancy, and inspire my heart, Excuse my bold attempt, and pardon me For shewing Sense, what Faith alone should see. Ten thousand Millions, and ten thousand more Of Angell-measur'd leagues from th'Easterne shore Of dungeon earth this glorious Palace stands, Before whose pearly gates, ten thousand Bands Of armed Angels wait, to entertaine Those purged soules, for whom the Lamb was slaine, Whose guiltlesse death, and voluntary yeelding Of whose giv'n life gave this brave Court her building; The lukewarme Blood of this deare Lamb being spilt, To Rubies turn'd, whereof her posts were built; And what dropte downe in cold and gelid gore, Did turne rich Saphyrs, and impav'd her floore: The brighter flames, that from his eye-balls ray'd, Grew Chrysolites, whereof her wals were made: The milder glaunces sparkled on the Ground. And grunsild ev'ry doore with Diamond: But, dying, darted upwards, and did fixe A Battlement of puret Sardonix: Her streets with burnisht Gold are paved round: Starres lie like pebbles scattered on the ground: Pearle, mixt with Onyx, and the Jasper stone, Made gravil'd Causewayes to be trampled on: There shines no Sun by day; no Moone, by night; The Pallace glory is the Pallace light: There is no time to measure motion by, There, time is swallow'd with Eternity; Wry-mouth'd disdaine, and corner-haunting lust, And twy-fac'd Fraud; and beetle-brow'd Distrust; Soule-boyling Rage; and trouble-state sedition; And giddy doubt; and goggle-ey'd suspition; And lumpish sorrow, and degen'rous feare Are banisht thence, and death's a stranger there: But simple love, and sempiternall joyes, Whose sweetnesse neither gluts, nor fulnesse cloyes; Where face to face, our ravisht eye shall see Great ELOHIM, that glorious One in Three, And Three in One; and, seeing Him, shall blesse Him, And blessing, love Him; and, in love, possesse Him: Here stay, my soule, and ravish in relation: Thy words being spent; spend now, in Contemplation. S. GREG. in Psal. 7 poenitent. Sweet Jesus, the World of the Father, the brightnesse of paternall glory, whom Angels delight to view, teach me to do thy will; that, led by thy good Spirit, I may come to that blessed City, where day is eternall, where there is certaine security, and secure eternity, and eternall peace, and peacefull happinesse, and happy sweetnesse, and sweet pleasure; where thou O God with the Father and the holy Spirit livest and raignest world without end. Ibid. There is light without darknesse; Joy without griefe; desire without punishment; love without sadnesse; satiety without loathing; safety without feare; health without disease; and life without death. EPIGRAM 14. [My soule, pry not too nearely; The Complexion] My soule, pry not too nearely; The Complexion Of Sols bright face is seen, but by Reflexion: But wouldst thou know what's heav'n? Ile tell thee what; Think what thou canst not think, and Heav'n is that. XV. CANTICLES VIII. XIV. Make haste my Beloved, and be like the Roe or the young Hart upon the Mountaines of Spices. Go, gentle Tyrant, goe; thy flames do pierce My soule too deep; thy flames are too too fierce: My marrow melts; my fainting Spirits fry Ith'torrid Zone of thy Meridian Eye; Away, away: Thy sweets are too perfuming; Turne, turne thy face; Thy fires are too consuming: Hast hence; and let thy winged steps out-goe The frighted Roe-buck, and his flying Roe. But wilt thou leave me then? O thou that art Life of my Soule, Soule of my dying heart, Without the sweet Aspect of whose faire Eyes, My soule does languish, and her solace dies; Art thou so easly woo'd? So apt to heare The frantick language of my foolish Feare? Leave, leave me not; nor turne thy beauty from me, Looke, looke upon me, though thine eyes ov'rcome me. O how they wound! But, how my wounds content me! How sweetly these delightfull paines torment me! How I am tortur'd in excessive measure Of pleasing cruelties too cruell pleasure! Turne, turne away; remove they scorching beames; I languish with these bitter-sweet extreames: Hast then, and let thy winged steps out-goe The flying Roe-buck, and his frighted Roe. Turne back, my deare; O let my revisht eye Once more behold thy face before thou flie; What? shall we part without a mutuall kisse? O who can leave so sweet a face as this? Looke full upon me; for my soule desires To turne a holy Martyr in those fires: O leave me not, nor turne thy beauty from me; Looke, looke upon me, though thy flames ov'rcome me. If thou becloud the Sun-shine of thine eye, I freeze to death; and if it shine, I frie; Which like a Fever, that my soule has got, Makes me burne too cold, or freeze to hot: Alas, I cannot beare so sweet a smart, Nor canst thou be lesse glorious than thou art: Hast then, and let thy winged steps out-goe The frighted Roe-buck, and his flying Roe. But goe not farre beyond the reach of breath; Too large a distance makes another death: My youth is in her Spring; Autumnall vowes Will make me riper for so sweet a Spouse, When after-times have burnish'd my desire, Ile shoot thee flames for flames, and fire for fire. O leave me not, nor turne thy beauty from me; Looke, looke upon me, though thy flames ov'rcome me. Author scalae Paradisi. Tom. 9. Aug. Cap. 8. Feare not O Bride, nor despaire; Thinke not thy self contemn'd, if thy Bridegroome withdraw his face awhile: All things co-operate for the best: Both from his absence, and his presence thou gainest light: He comes to thee, and he goes from thee: He comes, to make thee consolate; He goes, to make thee cautious, lest thy abundant consolation puffe thee up: He comes, that thy languishing soule may be comforted; He goes; lest his familiarity should be contemned; and, being absent, to be more desired; and being desired, to be more earnestly sought; and being long sought, to be more acceptably found. EPIGRAM 15. [My soule, sinnes monster, whom, with greater ease] My soule, sinnes monster, whom, with greater ease Ten thousand fold, thy GOD could make than please: What wouldst thou have? Nor pleas'd with Sun, nor shade? Heav'n knowes not what to make of what He made. THE FAREWELL. Be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee the crowne of life. REVELATION II. X. 1 Be faithfull? LORD, what's that Believe: 'Tis easie to Believe; But what? That He whom thy hard heart has wounded, And whom thy scorne has spit upon, Has paid thy Fine, and has compounded For those foule deeds thy hands have done. Believe, that He whose gentle palmes Thy needle-pointed Sinnes have nail'd, Hath borne thy slavish load (of Almes) And made supply where thou hast fail'd: Did ever mis'ry find so strange Relief? It is a Love too strong for man's Beliefe. 2 Believe that He whose side Thy crimes have pierc'd with their rebellions, di'd, To save thy guilty soule from dying Ten thousand horrid deaths, from whence There was no scape, there was no flying, But through his dearest bloods expence: Believe, this dying Friend requires No other thanks for all his paine; But ev'n the truth of weake desires, And for his love, but love againe; Did ever mis'ry find so true a Friend? It is love too vast to comprehend. 3 With Floods of teare baptize And drench these dry, these unregen'rate eyes; LORD, whet my dull, my blunt beliefe, And break this fleshly rock in sunder, That from this heart, this hell of griefe May spring a Heav'n of love and wonder: O, if thy mercies will remove And melt this lead from my beliefe, My griefe will then refine my love, My love will then refresh my griefe: Then weepe mine eyes as He has bled; vouchsafe To drop for ev'ry drop an Epitaph. 4 But is the Crowne of Glory The wages of a lamentable Story? Or can so great a purchase rise From a salt Humour? Can mine eye Run fast enough t'obtaine this Prize? If so, LORD, who's so mad to die? Thy Teares are Trifles; Thou must doe: Alas, I cannot; Then endeavour: I will: But will a tugg or two Suffice the turne? Thou must persever: Ile strive till death; And shall my feeble strife Be crown'd? Ile crowne it with a Crowne of life. 5 But is there such a dearth, That thou must buy what is thy due by birth? He whom Thy hands did forme of dust, And gave him breath upon Condition, To love his great Creator, must He now be thine, by Composition? Art thou a gracious GOD, and mild, Or head-strong man rebellious rather? O, man's a base rebellious Child, And thou a very gracious Father: The Gift is Thine; we strive; Thou crown'st our strife; Thou giv'st us Faith; and Faith, a Crowne of Life. THE END.</field>

The minde of the Frontispeece. This Bubble's Man: Hope, Feare, False Joy and Trouble, Are those Foure Winds which daily toss this Bubble. HIEROGLIPH I. Behold I was shaped in Iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. PSALMS 51. 5. Man is mans A B C: There is none that can Reade God aright, unless he first spell Man; Man is the Stayres, whereby his knowledge climes To his Creator; though it oftentimes Stumbles for want of light, and sometimes tripps For want of carefull heed; and sometimes slips Through unadvised hast; and when at length His weary steps have reach'd the top, his strength Oft fayles to stand; his giddy braines turne round, And Phaeton like, falls headlong to the ground: These stayres are often darke, and full of danger To him whom want of practice makes a stranger To this blind way: The Lamp of nature lends But a false Light; and lights to her owne ends: These be the wayes to Heav'n; These paths require A Light that springs from that diviner fire Whose humane soule-enlightning sunbeames dart Through the bright Crannies of th'immortall part. And here, thou great Originall of Light, Whose error-chaceing Beames do unbenight The very soule of Darkness, and untwist The Clouds of Ignorance; do thou assist My feeble Quill; Reflect thy sacred Rayes Upon these lines, that they may light the wayes That lead to thee; So guide my heart, my hand, That I may doe, what others understand: Let my heart practice what my hand shall write; Till then, I am a Tapour wanting light. This golden Precept, Know thy selfe, came downe From heav'ns high Court; It was an Art unknowne To flesh and blood. The men of Nature tooke Great Journies in it; Their dim eyes did looke But through a Mist; Like Pilgrims they did spend Their idle steps, but knew no Journies end: The way to Know thyselfe, is first to cast Thy fraile beginning, Progresse, and thy Last: This is the Summe of Man: But now returne And view this Tapour standing in this Urne: Behold her Substance, sordid and impure, Useless and vaine, and (wanting light) obscure: Tis but a Span at longest, nor can last Beyond that Span; ordain'd, and made to waste: Ev'n such was Man (before his soule gave light To his vile substance) a meere Child of night; Ere he had life, estated in his Vrne, And markt for death; by nature, borne to burne: Thus liveless, lightless, worthless first began That glorious, that presumptuous thing, call'd Man. St. AUGUST. Consider O man what thou wert before thy Birth, and what thou art from thy birth to thy death, and what thou shalt be after death: Thou wert made of an impure substance, cloathed and nourished in thy Mother's blood. EPIGRAM 1. [Forbeare fond Tapour: What thou seek'st, is Fire] Forbeare fond Tapour: What thou seek'st, is Fire: Thy owne distruction's lodg'd in thy desire: Thy wants are farre more safe than their supply: He that begins to live, begins to die. HIEROGLIPH II. And God said, Let there bee light; and there was light. GENESIS 1. 3. 1 This flame-expecting Tapour hath, at length, Received fyre; and, now, begins to burne: It hath no vigour yet, it hath no strength; Apt to be puft and quencht at ev'ry turne: It was a gracious hand that thus endow'd This snuffe with flame: But marke, this hand doth shroud It selfe from mortall eyes, and folds it in a Cloud. 2 Thus man begins to live; An unknowne flame Quickens his finisht Organs; now, possest With motion; and which motion doth proclaime An active soule, though in a feeble brest: But how, and when infus'd, ask not my Pen; Here flyes a Cloud before the eyes of men: I can not tell thee, how; nor can thou tell mee, when. 3 Was it a parcell of celestiall fire, Infus'd, by Heav'n, into this fleshly mould? Or was it (think you) made a soule entire? Then; was it new created? Or of old? Or is't a propagated Spark, rak'd out From Natures embers? Whilst we goe about, By reason, to resolve, the more we raise a doubt. 4 If it be part of that celestiall Flame, It must be ev'n as pure, as free from spot As that eternall fountaine whence it came: If pure, and spotlesse; then, whence came the blot? It selfe, being pure, could not it selfe defile; Nor hath unactive Matter pow'r to soile Her pure and active Forme, as Jarrs corupt their Oyle. 5 Or, if it were created, tell me, when? If in the first sixe dayes, where kept till now? Or, if the soule were new created, then Heav'n did not all, at first, he had to doe: Six dayes expird, all Creation ceast, All kinds, even from the greatest to the least Were finisht, and compleat, before the day of Rest. 6 But why should Man, the Lord of Creatures, want That priviledge which Plants and Beasts obtaine? Beasts bring forth Beasts, the Plant a perfect Plant; And every like brings forth her like againe: Shall fowles, and fishes, beasts and plants convey Life to their issue? And Man lesse than they? Shall these get living soules? And Man, dead lumps of clay? 7 Must humane soules be generated then? My water ebbs; behold, a Rock is nigh: If Natures worke produce the soules of men, Mans soule is mortall: All that's borne must die. What shall we then conclude? What sun-shine will Disperse this gloomy cloud? Till then, be still, My vainely striving thoughts; Lie down, my puzz'ld quill. ISODOR. Why doest thou wonder, O man, at the height of the Starres? or the depth of the sea? Enter into thine owne soule, and wonder there. The soule by creating is infused; by infusion, created. EPIGRAM 2.

PSALMS 103. 16. 1 No sooner is this lighted Tapour set Upon the transitory Stage Of eye-bedarkning night, But it is straight subjected to the threat Of envious windes, whose wastfull rage Disturbs her peacefull light, And makes her substance wast, and makes her flames lesse bright 2 No sooner are we borne, no sooner come To take possession of this vast, This soule-afflicting earth; But Danger meets us at the very wombe, And Sorrow with her full mouthd blast, Salutes our painefull birth, To put out all our Joyes, and puffe out all our mirth. 3 Nor Infant Innocence, nor childish teares, Nor youthfull wit, not manly power, Nor politick old age, Nor virgins pleading, nor the widows prayers, Nor lowely Cell, nor lofty Tower, Nor Prince, nor Peere, nor Page Can scape this common blast, or curb her stormy rage. 4 Our life is but a pilgrimage of blasts; And ev'ry blast brings forth a feare; And ev'ry feare, a death; The more it lengthens, ah, the more it wasts: Were, were we to continue here The dayes of long lif'd Seth, Our sorrowes would renew, as we renew our breath: 5 Tost too and fro, our frighted thoughts are driv'n With ev'ry puffe, with every Tide Of self-consuming Care; Our peacefull flame, that would point up to heav'n, Is still disturb'd, and turnd aside; And ev'ry blast of Ayre Commits such wast in man, as man cannot repaire. 6 W'are all borne Detters, and we firmely stand Oblig'd for our first Parents Det, Besides our Interest; Alas we have no harmeless Counterband, And we are, ev'ry hou'r, beset With threatnings of Arrest, And till we pay the Det, we can expect no Rest. 7 What may this sorrow-shaken life present To the false relish of our Tast, That's worth the name of sweet? Her minits pleasure's choakt with discontent, Her glory soyld with ev'ry blast; How many dangers meet Poore man, betwixt the Biggin and the Winding sheet! St. AUGUST. In this world, not to bee grieved, not to bee afflicted, not to bee in danger, is impossible. Ibid. Behold; the world is full of troubles; yet, beloved; What if it were a pleasing world? How wouldst thou delight in her Calmes, that canst so well endure her stormes? EPIGRAM 3. [Art thou consum'd with soule-afflicting crosses?] Art thou consum'd with soule-afflicting crosses? Disturb'd with griefe? annoy'd with worldly losses: Hold up thy head; The Tapour lifted high Will brook the wind, when lower Tapours dye. HIEROGLIPH IV. The whole need not the Physitian. MATTHEW 9, 12. 1 Always pruning? alwaies cropping? Is her brightnesse still obscur'd? Ever dressing? ever topping? Alwaies cureing? never cur'd? Too much snuffing makes a waste; When the spirits spend too fast, They will shrinke at ev'ry blast. 2 You that alwaies are bestowing Costly paines in lifes repairing, Are but alwaies overthrowing Natures worke, by overcaring: Nature meeting with her Foe, In a work she hath to doe, Takes a pride to overthrow. 3 Nature knowes her owne perfection, And her pride disdaines a Tutor, Can not stoope to Arts correction, And she scornes a Coadjutor; Saucy Art should not appeare Till she whisper in her eare: Hagar flees, if Sara beare. 4 Nature worketh for the better, If not hindred, that she cannot; Art stands by as her Abettor, Ending nothing she began not; If distemper chance to seize, (Nature foyl'd with the disease) Art may helpe her if she please. 5 But to make a Trade of trying Drugs, and Dosies, always pruning, Is to dye, for feare of dying; Hee's untun'd, thats alwaies tuneing. He that often loves to lack Deare bought Drugs, has found a Knack To foyle the man, and feede the Quack. 6 O the sad, the fraile Condition Of the pride of Natures glory! How infirme his Composition! And, at best, how Transitory! When his Ryot doth impayre Natures weaknesss, then his care Adds more ruine, by repaire. 7 Hold thy hand, healths Deare maintainer, Life perchance may burne the stronger: Having substance to sustaine her, She, untoucht, may last the longer: When the Artist goes about To redresse her flame, I doubt, Oftentimes he snuffes it out. NICOCLES Physitian of all men are most happy; what good success soever they have, the world proclaimes, and what faults they commit, the earth covers. EPIGRAM 4. [My purse be'ng heavy, if my Light appeare] My purse be'ng heavy, if my Light appeare But Dimme, Quack comes to make all cleare; Quack, leave thy trade; Thy Dealings are not right, Thou tak'st our weighty gold, to give us light. HIEROGLIPH V. And hee will give his Angels charge over thee. PSALMS 91. 1 O how mine eyes could please themselves, and spend Perpetuall Ages in this precious sight! How could I woo Eternity, to lend My wasting day an Antidote for night! And how my flesh could with my flesh contend, That views this object with no more delight! My work is great, my Tapour spends too fast: 'Tis all I have, and soone would out, or wast, Did not this blessed Screene protect it from the blast. 2 O, I have lost the Jewell of my soule, And I must finde it out, or I must dye: Alas! my sin-made darknesse, doth controule The bright endeavours of my carefull eye: I must goe search, and ransack ev'ry hole; Nor have I other light to seek it by: O if this light be spent, my work not done, My labour's worse than lost; my Jewel's gone, And I am quite forlorne, and I am quite undone. 3 You blesse Angels, you that doe enjoy The full fruition of eternall Glory, Will you be pleas'd to fancy such a Toy As man, and quit your glorious Territory, And stoop to earth, vouchsafing to imploy Your cares to guard the dust that lies before yee? Disdaine you not these lumps of dying Clay, That, for your paines, doe often times repay Neglect, if not disdaine, and send you griev'd away? 4 This Tapour of our lifes, that once was plac'd In the faire Suburbs of Eternity, Is now, alas, confin'd to ev'ry blast, And turn'd a May-pole for the sporting Fly; And will you, sacred Spirits, please to cast Your care on us, and lend a gracious eye? How had this slender Inch of Tapour beene Blasted, and blaz'd, had not this heav'nly Screene Curb'd the proud blast, and timely stept betweene! 5 O Goodnesse, farre transcending the report Of lavish tongues! too vast to comprehend! Amazed Quill, how farre dost thou come short T'express expressions, that so farre transcend! You blessed Courtiers of th'eternall Court, Whose full-mouth'd Hallelujahs have no end, Receive that world of praises that belongs To your great Sov'raigne; fill your holy tongues With our Hosannas, mixt with your Seraphick Songs. St. BERN. If thou desirest the helpe of Angels, flee the comforts of the world, and resist the Temptations of the Devill. He will give his Angels charge over thee? O what reverence, what love, what confidence deserves so sweet a saying? For their presence, reverence; for their goodwill, love; for their tuition, confidence. EPIGRAM 5. [My flame, art thou disturb'd, diseas'd, and driven] My flame, art thou disturb'd, diseas'd, and driven To Death with stormes of grief? Poynt thou to heav'n: One Angel, there, shall ease thee more, alone, Then thrice as many thousands of thy owne. HIEROGLIPH VI. To every thing there is an appointed time. ECCLESIASTES 3. 1. Time. Death. Time: Behold the frailty of this slender snuffe; Alas it hath not long to last: Without the helpe of either Thiefe, or puffe, Her weakness knows the way to wast: Nature hath made her Substance apt enough To spend it selfe, and spend too fast: It needs the help of none, That is so prone To lavish out, untoucht; and languish all alone. Death: Time, hold thy peace, and shake thy slow pac'd Sand; Thy idle Minits make no way: Thy glass exceeds her how'r, or else does stand, I can not hold; I can not stay; Surcease thy pleading, and enlarge my hand I surfet with too long delay: This brisk, this boldfac'd Light Does burne too bright; Darkness adornes my throne; my day is darkest night. Time: Great Prince of darknesse, hold thy needless hand; Thy Captiv's fast, and can not flee: What arme can rescue? Who can countermand, What pow'r can set thy Pris'ner free? Or if they could, what close, what forrein land Can hide that head, that flees from Thee? But if her harmeless light, Offend thy sight, What needst thou snatch at noone, what will be thine at night? Death: I have outstaid my patience; My quick Trade Growes dull and makes slow returne: This long-liv'd det is due, and should bin paid When first her flame began to burne: But I have staid too long, I have delayd To store my vast, my craving Urne. My Patent gives me pow'r, Each day, each how'r, To strike the Peasants thatch, and shake the Princely Tow'r. Time: 5 Thou count'st too fast: Thy Patent gives no Pow'r Till Time shall please to say, Amen. Death: Canst thou appoint my shaft? Time: Or thou my How'r? Death: Tis I bid, doe: Time: Tis I bid, When. Alas, thou canst not make the poorest Flow'r To hang the drooping head, till then: Thy shafts can neither Kill, Nor strike, untill My power gives them wings, and pleasure arme thy will! St. AUGUST. Thou knowest not what Time he will come: wait alwaies, that because thou knowest not the time of his comming, thou maiest be prepared against the time he comes. And for this, perchance, thou knowest not the Time, because thou maiest be prepared against all times. EPIGRAM 6. [Expect, but feare not Death: Death cannot kill] Expect, but feare not Death: Death cannot kill, Till Time, (that first must seale her Patent) will: Wouldst thou live long? Keepe Time in high esteeme; Whom, gone, if thou canst not recall, redeeme. HIEROGLIPH VII. His light shall be dark, and his candle shall be put out. JOB 18. 6. 1 What ayles our Tapour? Is her luster fled, Or foyl'd? What dire disaster bred This Change? that thus she vailes her golden head? 2 It was but very now she shin'd as faire As Venus starre: Her glory might compare With Cynthia, burnisht with her brothers haire. 3 There was no Cave-begotten damp that mought Abuse her beames; no wind, that went about To breake her peace; no Puffe, to put her out. 4 Lift up thy wondring thoughts, and thou shalt spye A Cause, will cleare thy doubts, but cloud thine eye: Subjects must vaile, when as their Sov'raign's by. 5 Canst thou behold bright Phoebus, and thy sight No whit impayr'd? The object is too bright; The weaker yeelds unto the stronger Light. 6 Great God, I am thy Tapour; Thou, my Sunne; From thee, the Spring of Light, my Light begun, Yet if thy Light but shine, my light is done. 7 If thou withdraw thy Light, my light will shine, If thine appeare, how poore a light is mine! My light is darkness, if compar'd to thine. 8 Thy Sun-beames are too strong for my weake eye; If thou but shine, how nothing, Lord, am I! Ah, who can see thy visage, and not die! 9 If intervening earth should make a night, My wanton flame would then shine forth too bright; My earth would ev'n presume t'eclipse thy Light. 10 And if thy Light be shadow'd, and mine fade, If thine be dark, and my dark light decayd, I should be cloathed with a double shade. 11 What shall I, doe? O what shall I desire? What help can my distracted thoughts require, That thus am wasting twixt a double Fire? 12 In what a streight, in what a streight am I? Twixt two extreames how my rackt fortunes lie? See I thy face, or see it not, I die. 13 O let the streame of my Redeemers blood, That breaths fro' my sick soule, be made a Cloud, T'interpose these Lights, and be my shroud. 14 Lord, what am I? or what's the light I have? May it but light my Ashes to their Grave, And so from thence, to Thee? 'tis all I crave. 15 O make my Light, that all the world may see Thy Glory by't: If not, It seemes to me Honour enough, to be put out by Thee. O Light inaccessible, in respect of which my light is utter darknesse; so reflect upon my weakness, that all the world may behold thy strength: O majesty incomprehensible, in respect of which my glory is meere shame, so shine upon my misery that all the world may behold thy glory. EPIGRAM 7. [Wilt thou complaine, because thou are bereiv'n] Wilt thou complaine, because thou are bereiv'n Of all thy light? Wilt thou vie Lights with Heav'n? Can thy bright eye not brooke the daily light? Take heed: I feare, thou art a Child of night. HIEROGLIPH VIII. Let your light so shine, that men seeing your good workes may glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. MATTHEW 5. 16. 1 Was it for this, the breath of Heav'n was blowne Into the nostrils of this Heav'nly Creature? Was it for this, that sacred Three in One Conspir'd to make this Quintessence of Nature? Did heav'nly Providence intend So rare a Fabrick for so poore and end? 2 Was Man, the highest Master-peece of Nature, The curious Abstract of the whole Creation, Whose soule was copied from his great Creator, Made to give Light, and set for Observation, Ordain'd for this? To spend his Light In a darke-Lanthorne? Cloystred up in night? 3 Tell me, recluse Monastick, can it be A disadvantage to thy beames to shine? A thousand Tapours may gaine light from Thee: Is thy Light less, or worse for lighting mine? If, wanting Light, I stumble, shall Thy darkness not be guilty of my fall? 4 Why dost thou lurk so close? Is it for feare Some busie eye should pry into thy flame, And spie a Thiefe, or else some blemish there? Or being spy'd, shrink'st thou thy head for shame? Come, come, fond Tapour shine but cleare, Thou needst not shrink for shame, nor shroud for feare. 5 Remember, O remember, thou wert set, For men to see the Great Creator by; Thy flame is not thy owne: It is a Det Thou ow'st thy Maker; And wilt thou deny To pay the Int'rest of thy Light? And skulk in Corners; and play least in sight? 6 Art thou affraid to trust thy easie flame To the injurious wast of Fortunes puffe? Ah, Coward, rouze; and quit thy selfe, for shame; Who dies in service, hath liv'd long enough: Who shines, and makes no eye partaker, Usurps himselfe, and closely robbs his Maker 7 Take not thy selfe a Pris'ner, that art free: Why dost thou turne thy Palace to a Jaile? Thou art an Eagle; And befits it thee To live immured, like a cloysterd Snaile? Let Toies seeke Corners: Things of cost Gaine worth by view: Hid Jewels are but lost. 8 My God, my light is dark enough at lightest, Encrease her flame, and give her strength to shine: Tis fraile at best: Tis dimme enough at brightest, But 'tis her glory to be foyld by Thine. Let others lurke; My light shall be Propos'd to all men; and by them, to Thee. St. BERN. If thou be one of the foolish Virgins, the Congregation is necessary for thee; If thou be one of the wise Virgins, thou art necessary for the Congregation. HUGO. Monasticks make Cloysters to inclose the outward man, O would to God they would doe the like to restraine the inward Man. EPIGRAM 8. [Affraid of eyes? What, still play least in sight?] Affraid of eyes? What, still play least in sight? Tis much to be presum'd all is not right: Too close endeavours, bring forth dark events: Come forth, Monastick; Here's no Parliaments. HIEROGLIPH IX. He cometh forth like a Flower and is cut downe. JOB 14. 2. 1 Behold How short a span Was long enough, of old, To measure out the life of Man! In those wel temper'd days his time was then Survey'd, cast up, and found but threescore years and ten. 2 Alas And what is that? They come and slide and pass Before my Pen can tell thee, what. The Posts of Time are swift, which having run Their sev'n short stages o're, their short liv'd task is done. 3 Our daies Begun, wee lend To sleepe, to antick plaies And Toyes, untill the first stage end: 12. waining Moons, twise 5. times told, we give To unrecover'd loss: Wee rather breathe, than live. 4 Wee spend A ten years breath, Before wee apprehend What is to live, or feare a death: Our childish dreams are fil'd with painted joys, Which please our sense a while; and waking, prove but Toies. 5 How vaine How wretched is Poore man, that doth remain A slave to such a State as this! His daies are short, at longest; few, at most; They are but bad, at best; yet lavisht out, or lost. 6 They bee The secret Springs, That make our minits flee On wheeles more swift then Eagles wings: Our life's a Clocke, and ev'ry gaspe of breath Breathes forth a warning grief, til Time shal strike a death. 7 How soone Our new-born Light Attaines to full-ag'd noone! And this, how soon to gray-hayr'd night! Wee spring, we bud, we blossome, and we blast E're we can count our daies; Our daies they flee so fast. 8 They end When scarce begun; And ere wee apprehend That we begin to live, our life is don: Man, Count thy daies; And if they flee too fast For thy dull thoughts to count, count ev'rie day thy last. Our Infancy is counted in eating and sleeping; in all which time what differ we from the beasts, but by a possibility of reason, and a necessity of sinne? O misery of mankind, in whom no sooner the Image of God appeares in the act of Reason, but the Devill blurres it in the corruption of his will! EPIGRAM 9. [Thus was the first seav'nth part of they few daies] Thus was the first seav'nth part of they few daies Consum'd in sleep, in food, in Toyish plaies: Knowst thou what teares thine eies imparted then? Review thy losse, and weep them o're agen. HIEROGLIPH X. His bones are full of the sinnes of his youth. JOB 20. 11. 1 The swift-foot Post of Time hath now begun His second Stage; The dawning of our Age Is lost and spent without a Sun: The light of Reason did not yet appeare Within th'Horizon of this Hemispheare. 2 The infant Will had yet none other guide, But twilight Sense; And what is gayn'd from thence But doubtfull Steps, that tread aside? Reason now draws her Curtains; Her clos'd eyes Begin to open, and she calls to rise. 3 Youths now disclosing Buds peeps out, and showes Her Aprill head; And from her grass greene bed, Her virgin Primerose early blowes; Whil'st waking Philomel prepares to sing Her warbling Sonets to the wanton Spring. 4 His Stage is pleasant, and her way seemes short, All strow'd with flowers; The daies appeare but howers, Being spent in time-beguiling sport. Here griefes do neither press, nor doubts perplex; Here's neither feare, to curb; nor care, to vex. 5 His downie Cheek growes proud, and now disdaines The Tutors hand; He glories to command The proud neckt Steed with prouder Reynes: The strong breath'd Horne must now salute his eare, With the glad downefall of the falling Deare. 6 His quicknos'd Armie, with their deepmouth'd sounds, Must now prepare To chase the tim'rous Hare About his, yet unmorgag'd, Grounds; The ev'll he hates, is Counsell, and delay, And feares no mischief, but a rainie day. 7 The thought he takes, is how to take no thought For bale, nor blisse; And late Repentance is The last deare Pen'worth that he bought: He is a daintie Morning, and he may, If lust o'recast him not, b'as faire a Day. 8 Proud Blossom, use thy Time; Times headstrong Horse Will post away; Trust not the foll'wing day, For ev'ry day brings forth a worse: Take Time at best: Beleeve't, thy daies will fall From good, to bad; From bad, to worst of all. St. AMB. Humility is a rare thing in a young man, therefore to be admired: When youth is vigorous, when strength is firme, when blood is hot, when Cares are strangers, when mirth is free, then Pride swells, and humility is despised. EPIGRAM 10. [Thy yeares are newly gray; His, newly Greene] Thy yeares are newly gray; His, newly Greene; His youth may live to see what thine hath seene; Hee is thy Parallel: His present Stage And tine, are the two Tropicks of Mans Age. HIEROGLIPH XI. Rejoyce O young man, and let thy heart cheare thee, but know, &amp;c. ECCLESIASTES 11. 9. 1 How flux! how alterable is the date Of transitory things! How hurry'd on the clipping wings Of Time, and driv'n upon the wheeles of Fate! How one Condition brings The leading Prologue to an other State! No transitory things can last: Change waits on Time; and Time is wing'd with hast; Time present's but the Ruins of Time past. 2 Behold how Change hath incht away thy Span, And how thy light does burne Nearer and nearer to thy Urne: For this deare wast what satisfaction can Injurious time returne Thy shortned daies, but this; the Stile of Man? And what's a Man? A cask of Care, New tunn'd, and working; Hee's a middle Staire Twixt birth and death; A blast of ful ag'd Ayre. 3 His brest is Tinder, apt to entertaine The sparks of Cupids fire, Whose new-blowne flames must now enquire A wanton Juilippe out, which may restraine The Rage of his desire, Whose painfull pleasure is but pleasing paine. His life's a sicknes, that does rise From a hot Liver, whilst his passion lies Expecting Cordials from his Mistress eyes. 4 His Stage is strowd with Thornes, and deckt with Flowers; His yeare sometimes appeares A Minit; and his Minits, yeares; His doubtfull Weather's sun-shine, mixt with showers; His traffique, Hopes and Feares: His life's a Medly, made of sweets and sowers; His paines reward is Smiles, and Pouts; His diet is faire language mixt with Flouts; He is a Nothing all compos'd of Doubts. 5 Doe; wast thy Inch, proud Span of living earth; Consume thy golden daies In slavish freedome; Let thy waies Take best avantage of thy frolick mirth; Thy Stock of Time decaies; And lavish plenty still foreruns a Dearth: The bird that's flowne may turne at last; And painefull labour may repaire a wast; But paines nor price can call thy minits past. SEN. Expect great joy when thou shalt lay downe the mind of a Child, and deserve the stile of a wise man; for at those yeares childhood is past, but oftentimes childishnesse remaines, and what is worse, thou hast the Authority of a Man, but the vices of a Childe. EPIGRAM 11. [Why standest thou discontented? Is not he] Why standest thou discontented? Is not he As equall distant from the Toppe as thee? What then may cause thy discontented frowne? Hee's mounting up the Hill; Thou plodding downe! HIEROGLIPH XII. As thy daies, so shall thy strength be. DEUTERONOMY 33. 25. The Post Of swift foot Time Hath now, at length, begun The Kalends of our middle Stage: The number'd Steps that we have gone, do show The number of those Steps wee are to goe: The Buds and blossoms of our Age Are blowne, decay'd, and gone, And all our prime Is lost; And what we boast too much, we have least cause to boast. Ah mee! There is no Rest, Our Time is alwaies fleeing: What Rein can curb our headstrong hours! They post away: They passe wee know not how: Our Now is gone, before wee can say, Now: Time past and futur's none of ours; That, hath as yet no Being; And This hath ceast To bee: What is, is onely ours: How short a Time have Wee! And now Apolloes eare Expects harmonious straines, New minted from the Thracian Lyre; For now the Virtue of the twiforkt Hill Inspires the ravisht fancy, and doth fill The veines with Pegasean fire: And now, those sterill braines That cannot show, Nor beare Some fruits, shall never weare Appollos sacred Bow. Excesse And surfets uses To wait upon these daies: Full feed, and flowing cups of wine Conjure the fancy, forcing up a Spright, By the base Magick of deboysd delight; Ah pittie twiseborne Bacchus Vine Should starve Apollo's Bayes, And drown those Muses That blesse And calm the peaceful soule, when stormes of care oppres. Strong light, Boast not those beames That can but onely rise, And blaze awhile, and then away: There is no Solstice in thy day; Thy midnight glory lies Betwixt th'extrems Of night, A Glory foyld with shame, and foold with false delight Hast thou climbd up to the full age of thy few daies? Look backwards, and thou shalt see the frailty of thy youth; the folly of thy Childhood, and the waste of thy Infancy: Looke forwards; thou shalt see, the cares of the world, the troubles of thy mind, the diseases of thy body. EPIGRAM 12. [Thou that art prauncing on the lustie Noone] Thou that art prauncing on the lustie Noone Of thy full Age, boast not thy selfe too soone: Convert that breath to wayle thy fickle state; Take heed; thoul't brag too soone, or boast too late. HIEROGLIPH XIII. Hee must encrease, but I must decrease. JOHN 3. 30. Time voyds the Table: Dinner's done; And now our daies declining Sun Hath hurried his diurnall Loade To th'Borders of the Westerne roade; Fierce Phlegon, with his fellow Steeds, Now puffes and pants, and blowes and bleeds, And froths, and fumes, remembering still Their lashes up th'Olympick Hill: Which, having conquerd, now disdaine The whip, and champs the frothy reyn, And, with a full Career, they bend Their paces to their Journies end: Our blazing Tapour now hath lost Her better halfe: Nature hath crost Her forenoone book, and cleard that score, But scarce gives trust for so much more: And now the gen'rous Sappe forsakes Her seir-grown twig: A breath ev'n shakes The down-ripe fruit; fruit soon divorc'd From her deare Branch, untouchd, unforc'd. Now sanguine Venus doth begin To draw her wanton colours in; And flees neglected in disgrace, Whil'st Mars supplies her lukewarm place: Blood turnes to Choler: What this Age Loses in strength it finds in Rage: That rich Ennamell, which of old, Damaskt the downy Cheeke, and told A harmeless guile, unaskt, is now Worne off from the audacious brow; Luxurious Dalliance, midnight Revells, Loose Ryot, and those veniall evils Which inconsiderate youth of late Could pleade, now wants an Advocate, And what appeard in former times Whispring as faults, now roare as crimes. And now all yee, whose lippes were wont To drench their Currall in the Font Of forkt Parnassus, you that be The Sons of Phoebus, and can flee On wings of Fancy, to display The Flagge of high invention, stay: Repose your Quills; Your veines grow sower, Tempt not your Salt beyond her power: If your pall'd Fancies but decline, Censure will strike at every line And wound your names; The popular eare Weighs what you are, not what you were. Thus hackney like, we tire our Age, Spurgall'd with Change, from Stage to Stage. Seest thou the daily light of the greater world? When attaind to the highest pitch of Meridian glory, it staieth not, but by the same degrees, it ascendeth, it descends. And is the light of the lesser world more permanent? Continuance is the Child of Eternity, not of Time. EPIGRAM 13. [Young man, rejoyce; And let thy rising daies] Young man, rejoyce; And let thy rising daies Cheare thy glad heart; Thinkst thou these uphill waies Leade to death's dungeon? No: but know withall, Arising is but Prologue to a Fall. HIEROGLIPH XIV. Yet a lttle while is the light with you. JOHN 12. 35. 1 The day growes old; The low pitcht Lamp hath made No lesse than treble shade: And the descending damp does now prepare T'uncurle bright Titans haire; Whose Westerne Wardrobe, now begins t'unfold Her purples, fring'd with gold, To cloathe his evening glory; when th'alarmes Of Rest shall call to rest in restless Thetis armes. 2 Nature now calls to Supper, to refresh The spirits of all flesh; The toyling ploughman drives his thirsty Teames, To tast the slipp'ry Streames: The droyling Swineheard knocks away, and feasts His hungry-whining guests: The boxbill Ouzle, and the dappled Thrush Like hungry Rivals meet, at their beloved bush. 3 And now the cold Autumnall dewes are seene To copwebbe every Greene; And by the low-shorne Rowins doth appeare The fast-declining yeare. The Sapless Branches d'off their summer Suits And waine their winter fruits: And stormy blasts have forc'd the quaking Trees To wrap their trembling limbs in Suits of mossie Freeze. 4 Our wasted Tapour, now hath brought her light To the nest dore to night; Her sprightless flame, grown great with snuffe, does turn Sad as her neighb'ring Urne: Her slender Inch, that yet unspent remaines; Lights but to further paines And in a silent language bids her guest Prepare his wearie limbs to take eternall Rest. 5 Now carkfull Age hath pitcht her painefull plough Upon the furrow'd brow; And snowie blasts of discontented Care Hath blancht the falling haire: Suspitious envie mixt with jealous Spight Disturb's his wearie night: He threatens youth with age: And, now, alas, He ownes not what he is, but vaunts the Man he was. 6 Gray haires, peruse thy daies; And let thy past Reade lectures to thy last: Those hastie wings that hurri'd them away Will give these daies no Day: The constant wheeles of Nature scorne to tyre Untill her worke expire: That blast that nipt thy youth, will ruine Thee; That hand that shooke the branch will quicklie strike the Tree. St. CHRYS. Gray hayres are honourable, when the behaviour suits with gray hayres: But when an ancient man hath childish manners, he becomes more ridiculous than a childe. SEN. Thou art in vaine attained to old yeares, that repeatest thy youthfulnesse. EPIGRAM 14. [Seest thou this good old man? He represents] Seest thou this good old man? He represents Thy Future; Thou, his Preterperfect Tense; Thou go'st to labour, He prepares to Rest: Thou break'st thy Fast; He suppes: Now which is best? HIEROGLIPH XV. The dayes of oure yeares are threescore yeares and ten. PSALMS 90. 10. 1 So have I seene th'illustrious Prince of Light Rising in glorie from his Crocean bed, And trampling downe the horrid shades of night, Advancing more and more his conq'ring head. Pause first; decline; at length, begin to shroud His fainting browes within a cole black cloud. 2 So have I seene a well built Castle stand Upon the Tiptoes of a lofty Hill, Whose active pow'r commands both Sea and Land, And curbs the pride of the Beleag'rers will; At length her ag'd Foundation failes her trust; And layes her tottering ruines in the Dust. 3 So have I seene the blazing Tapour shoot Her golden head into the feeble Ayre; Whose shadow-gilding Ray, spred around about, Makes the foule face of black-browd darknesse faire; Till at length her wasting glory fades, And leaves the night to her invet'rate shades. 4 Ev'n so this little world of living Clay, The pride of Nature, glorified by Art, Whom earth adores, and all her hosts obay, Ally'd to Heav'n by his Diviner part, Triumphs a while, then droops, and then decaies, And worne by Age, Death cancells all his daies. 5 That glorious Sun, that whilom shone so bright, Is now ev'n ravisht from our darkned eyes; That sturdy Castle, man'd with so much might, Lyes now a Monument of her owne disguize: That blazing Tapour, that disdain'd the puffe Of troubled Ayre, scarce ownes the name of Snuffe. 6 Poore bedrid Man! where is thy glory now, Thy Youth so vaunted? Where that Majesty Which sat enthron'd upon thy manly brow? Where, where that braving Arme? that daring eye? Those buxom tunes? Those Bacchanalian Tones? Those swelling veynes? those marrow-flowing bones? 7 Thy drooping Glory's blurrd, and prostrate lyes Grov'ling in dust; And frightfull Horror, now, Sharpens the glaunces of thy gashfull eyes, Whilst feare perplexes thy distracted brow: Thy panting brest vents all her breath by groanes, And Death enervs thy marrow-wasted bones. 8 Thus Man, that's borne of woman can remaine But a short time; His dayes are full of sorrow; His life's a penance, and his death's a paine, Springs like a flow'r to day, and fades to morrow? His breath's a bubble, and his daies a Span. Tis glorious misery to be borne a Man. CYPR. When eyes are dimme, eares deafe, visage pale, teeth decaid, skin withered; breath tainted, pipes furred, knees trembling, hands fumbling; feet fayling, the sudden downefall of thy fleshly house is neare at hand. St. AUGUST. All vices wax old by Age: Covetousness alone, growes young. EPIGRAM 15. To the Infant. What he doth spend in groanes, thou spendst in teares: Judgment and strength's alike in both your yeares; Hee's helpless; so art thou; What difference than? Hee's an old Infant; Thou, a young old Man THE END</field>
