      <field name="fulltext">AN HEROIC EPISTLE TO SIR JAMES WRIGHT. My fault being nothing, as I told you oft, But that two villains (whose false Oaths prevail'd Before my perfect Honour) swore to Cymbeline I was confederate with the Romans. Shakespeare. Knight, Broker A Broker, according to Shakespeare's definition, is a Man who deals in Old Household Goods, Pictures, &amp;c.âI flatter myself, therefore, that the well-instructed Reader will acquit me of the Guilt of Misapplication., Patriot! by whatever name You look for present pence, or future fame, Accept the willing tribute of the Muse, Who to such blended worth can ne'er refuse To weave the freshest flow'rets and entwine The blooming Garland round an head like thine; While, with no venal voice, she shall impart Her faithful Councils to your feeling Heart. Truth will direct her Lay, nor shall she pain Thy honest bosom with a flattering strain. How hard, 'midst erring mortals, 'tis to find One candid Spirit to each Object blind Of sordid Int'rest, and who looks to stray But where true Honour marks the thorny way! Whose daring thoughts and wishes nobly roam Beyond the Suburbs of his native home, And, in one animated grasp, embrace His friends, his Country, and the human race; Unmov'd by perils, but by death subdu'd, Urg'd by the Godlike Hopes of doing good. Such were the Knights of old, when Knighthood wore Those well-won Trophies which are seen no more: When, by the Love of sacred fame inspir'd, By Kings encourag'd, and by Beauty fir'd, The youthful Hero took his ardent way, And robb'd the Griffin Passion of his prey; Protected helpless Innocence, and gave Death to the Tyrant, Freedom to the Slave; And sought a glorious Fate, or liv'd renown'd, By Kings rewarded, and by Beauty crown'd. No sordid Treasures to his home he bore; The wreath which Love and Glory gave he wore: His batter'd Arms and deep-indented Scars, Won 'mid the Toil of honourable wars, Confirm'd his Glory, and enroll'd his Name In the bright Annals of recording Fame. Not such the Titles of our modern Times, When men, instead of Virtues, for their crimes, Some pliant business, or some paltry Trade, Are Knights and Ministers This melancholy truth may, I fear, be, with equal Justice, applied to Ministers of all denominations, but its immediate relation is only meant to extend to the Corps diplomatique. Sir J? W? well knows that a supposed Knowledge in the Trade of Picture-dealing has been considered as an essential Qualification in a Minister appointed to an Italian Republic;âand that his business there was not so much to enquire into the secrets of the cabinet abroad, as to purchase Decorations for his Master's Cabinet at home. and Nobles made. Honour is now the Moon-struck Madman's Theme;â The valiant Stripling sees him in a Dream, But 'waking, he is gone!âThe Love of Self, Of empty titles, and of solid pelf, Supplies his place, and th' ill-gotten see Buys the best rights of modern Chivalry. You smile, my Knight, and think the Madman's rage Spits forth its foamings on this idle page. You'll tell me that the noble Brothers bore The brightest Honour from the Northern shore; That Honour penn'd the orders which controul'd The Zeal for fight and Courage of the bold, And sav'd the daring Navy of the Foe From the quick ruin of the depths below: That, late return'd from its excursive flights 'Mid the camp's gay alarms and soft delights, It takes its common post, well-pleas'd to wait, In meek Submission, at St. James's Gate: There smiles importance, and expands its Wings O'er Kings and Footmen, and the Slaves of Kings. 'Twas there you bow'd, and with some little Skill In what is painting well or painting ill, You crept, with silent pace, amid the Band That bears the Banner of the Bloody Hand. The new, the ruddy Emblem of your State Glows on your Coach, and blushes at your Gate. Engrav'd with curious art, and made more bright, Your Jorden is the Jorden of a Knight: And, in the Village-walk, the Echo teems With your new title,âand returns Sir James! âThese, these are trifles, and afford at best An idle subject for a merry Jest. But why exert your skill and try your art To paint the bloody hand upon your Heart? 'Tis this awakes my pen, and will prolong The honest rage of my unpolish'd song. Honour's a sacred name, to Truth ally'd, The stubborn foe of Cowardice and Pride; Friend to the virtuous, wheresoe'er they dwell, Or in the gilded dome or lonely cell: Nor quits them dead;âbut, to his Nature just, Guards from polluting hands their sacred dust. E'en now, despising ev'ry titled slave, He weeps, in silence, over Chatham's Grave. âBehold his splendid Form, in sorrow drown'd, With darksome Yew and baleful Cypress crown'd; While from his flowing Eyes the dropping tear Waters the Laurel he has planted there! There shall it flourish, in eternal bloom, And shroud, in verdant pride, the holy tomb. âHere could I weep, but that resentment dries The briny streams which sorrow's tide supplies; A fix'd and stern resentment against those, Who, foes to Britain, are her Chatham's Foes; And, stung with Envy, or with selfish aim, Strove with foul whisp'rings to pollute his fame. How lost to shame!âhow free from all pretence To Honour, Justice, Truth, and common sense, Must that Man be who wishes to controul The just emotions, in his conscious soul, Which urge, with gen'rous force, the homage due To worth superiorâto the noble few, Who, true to honour and its sacred Laws, Live, fight, and die, in that forsaken cause! âYet such there are, who never yet were known To look on any Merit but their own; Who, sway'd by Int'rest, or inflam'd by Pride, Ne'er saw the worth they did not wish to hide; And with the same foul jaundic'd Eye behold The rich, the wise, the virtuous, and the bold: While some, less brave, more subtle arts employ, Praise but to damn, and flatter to destroy. âYes, such there areâBut if there should arise Some Giant Merit, whose stupendous size Would awe and still at once the hissing croud, Make the proud humble, and the humble proud; And, form'd to give a mighty Nation Laws, Should, by his Virtues, win the world's Applause; And, crown'd with fame and patriot glory, prove The first great Object of his Country's Loveâ Should such an one ariseâaghast they fly, And in their filthy dens in secret lie; Or take some Courtier's form, and patient wait Till the sure, all-controuling Hand of Fate Shall lay him low:âThen how the cowards brave That after-fame which lives beyond the Grave; With sacrilegious Joy pronounce his doom, And spit their Venom on his rev'rend Tomb! Such have I seen; and, 'mid the worthless Crew, It griev'd me to behold a Knight like You. I saw the terrors of your bloody hand; I heard the Scotchman give his proud command; I saw you, shrouded in rebellious plaid, Hie to the Tomb where Chatham's bones are laid;â Drawn from your breast the treach'rous Dirk appear'd, When, lo! her angry form Britannia rear'd, And drove you disappointed back, to woo Forgiveness of the Lord of Luton-Hoo. âSay, was it love of show, or want of pelf, That made you thus a Traitor to yourself? The deed's but poorly paid, tho' it ensure The silver Star, or golden Sinecure. âWas promis'd Honour the inviting bait, Which tempted you to trifle with the State?â Honour is often coy,âtho' Kings accord The blazon'd Patent which creates a Lord. âIf to be known was your high-minded aim, Rejoice, Sir J?s! for while accursing Fame Can blow her trump, you ne'er will be forgot, âThe pliant Engine of a treach'rous Scot. âThus the bold Fool, who, to secure a name, To Dian's Temple bore th' unwilling flame, Obtain'd his end;âfor, to his purpose true, Fame gave the meed to frantic folly due. Dup'd, disappointed, ev'ry scheme unveil'd, Without deserted, and within assail'd By keen vexation's smart;âcompell'd to fly To that Tribunal which detests a Lie;â What for your future Comfort can remain, But cold Compassion's miserable strain, That makes the mind a quicker anguish feel, And wounds more deeply, where it strives to heal! âLeave, then, Ambition,âaim not to assume An higher Office than a Royal Groom; Content that twice a Year your Eyes will see The common dressing-room of Majesty: Too happy that the royal Lace expands The King's Lace, Linen, &amp;c. are yearly divided, by Lot, among the Grooms of the Bedchamber. The consequence derived from the wearing of royal rags does not appear to be very great: nevertheless, I have been present when a Slave of St. James's glowed with Importance from an impudent exposure of the Tail of his Shirt, to shew an astonished Company the Crown and G. R. which were worked upon it. Its ruffled Beauties o'er your honour'd hands; That in a King's dull Night-cap you repose, And with a regal 'Kerchief wipe your nose; Too honour'd that you still enjoy the place Which Mordaunt oft has curs'd, and Mordaunt's race This Gentleman is of a very respectable family in the County of Warwick, and was, as many of his Ancestors had been, one of its representatives in Parliament: however, from this Honour he was rejected at the last Election, on account of his being a Groom of the King's Bedchamber, the lower class of voters being artfully impressed with a belief that certain very obscene duties are annexed to that Office.. Believe me, your unknown and vulgar Name When this Person (for at that time he was not advanced to Knighthood) was first, appointed to his courtly employment, no one knew who he was, or had ever heard of him; he seemed, like one of Cadmus's Men, to have sprung out of the Earth: however, it was soon discovered that he either was himself, or had married, a Relation of the Bingley Family, who were connected by marriage with the late Earl of Northington,âand so on. Was never meant to flourish into fame. âNo more among the clouds attempt to roam, But scold your wife, and tyrannize at Home: Of Pictures prattle; tell, for 'tis your Trade, How Reubens' Colours glow,âhow Reynolds' fade: From Village Neighbours some light honours claim, And speak with Reverence of your Master's Name From Sir J?s's description of the reverence with which he thinks the sacred Name of Majesty should be mentioned (see his Defence), I should really suppose that, if he had been a Papist, he never would have spoke of his Master without making the sign of the Cross.: Grin sweet Importance,âby yourself repine; But laugh in public at a verse like mine: And if your purse should fail,âyou still may flea More Dupes beside the K? and Coventry While Sir J? resided at Venice, several Cargoes of Vertu were sent from thence to the Q?s Palace.âAnd it is equally certain that, some Years ago, he sold a Collection of Pictures to the Earl of C? for several Thousand Pounds, the real value of which was then well known to every one but the Noble Purchaser.. Farewel, Sir James!âtho' you'll not think me so, I am my Country's Friend, and no man's foe. But while the blood-streams in my art'ries glide, Ne'er will I my unsheath'd resentment hide, When British Folly stoops to Scottish Pride: While Britons are by Villain-Statesmen led, Like senseless Drunkards reeling to their Bed: While the same voice which sells a Monarch's Fame Its venal Slander flings at Chatham's Name That Huzzas have been purchased for Parliament-street, and Plaudits for the Theatre, is well known; nay, in the late military Expedition, the same Care for his M?'s Glory has been exerted.âIt may, therefore, be naturally supposed that the hireling voices which are applied to the purposes of political Flattery, may be equally useful in the business of political Detraction, unless the ministerial policy, in fashion, of dividing places, should operate, in this particular, to the employment of distinct People in these honourable Commissions..
