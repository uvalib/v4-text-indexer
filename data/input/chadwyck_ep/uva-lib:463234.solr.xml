      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE RICHARD, EARLE OF Carbery. The Argument. The Authour here my Noble Lord acquaints What Paths they tread who lead the lives of Saints, What Comforts he shall finde, what good successe, While he walks in the New-mans Diocesse. I sound nor forth Old Souldours turn'd to Swine By Harlots Charmes, by fulsome Cheere or Wine; But the New-borne (a Theame to Worldlings strange) I sing the Minds more then the Bodies Change; I sing the Churches Change, Eclipse, Decrease, Her East, and West, with her Full Moones Encrease. Such Newes I blaze, which no good Protestant Shall justly taxe for Sparkes exorbitant, Like to those Brats expos'd to Brambles Flame By Midwives Doome to hide the Parents shame, Or those, for which of late our Pauls Church-yard And Smith-field in the Spoiles with Vulcan shar'd. Truth smites the Chast: while Wantons long to heare False Tales, at which they Nod, or fondly Jeere, Fooling away the Time, their pretious Time, Lent them for better use in Prose or Rime, To win some Strayes by meanes of Vertuous Books, Not Soules to tempt with Fornications Hookes. There, with much Gall Gulls one another flout: Heere for Mistakes, the Lie, or Toyes they pout, Forgetting Satans Ambush for Goodwits, Tongues trip, Pens blur, None free from Passions Fits, And yet for Words and Names, Externall things, They persecute their Christian Mates with stings, Till tir'd at last with Conscience-griping Cares, Both Parties howle within the Divels Snares. Others by Lines and Cubes aspire to know The Higher Orbes, or in the Globe below They levell Spires, the Climates, or the Lawes, Into whose Depth they pry no more then Dawes; And yet to gaine applause, or Golden Fees, They hope for Swans to chop their gaggling Geese. Some Court Faire Dames with Fancies Madrigalls, Chaulking the way to Paphian Lupercalls, Which they frequent with uncontrouled Lust Till Honour, Wealth, and Health lye in the Dust. Sometimes Pelagian-wise they ruminate On Mans Free-will, and the Predestinate, Till they from Grace quite excommunicate Doe pitch on Hell, and on the Reprobate. Now, of long-handed Kings the mounted state, Anon, their slips or Fall they personate With Satyres sting, untill themselves are stung; Or else they sooth Great men with glozing Tongue, Untill they feele worse Racks with Conscience sear'd, Then Poets faign'd for stroaking of Joves Beard. Some other whiles they dare more Curious peepe Into the Concaves of th' Infernall Deepe, Of Limboes Vault, or Purgatories Paine Redeem'd for Gold the long-white Robe to staine. With such Bald Stuffe most Writers doe oppresse, In hope to purchase Fame, the Printers Presse. Which shewes, that Soules, like Seas tost with unrest, Wave, till they set into Gods Port of Rest; Or else that they, like Swine, fall to worse Seas Then Gaderens for their prodigious Pleas, Remonstrances, and Problems, which they pend, Of Rampant Zeale the Churches Peace to rend. So busie is Mans Braine: It alwayes workes And seekes to know what from the Sences lurkes, Abstruse and hid, like Planets moving still; But in default of Objects good or ill, Because it finds no business from without, Turnes Monke within, an Ideot, or a Lout; Or on it selfe with Atomes and Chymeres Playes Whirligig, untill it ends in Feares, Distractions, Lies, and Schismes, just Penalties Due for the Search of Knotty Novelties. For want of Grace, and of Celestiall Armes, Sighes, Teares, &amp; Vowes, thus by the Serpents charmes Are Men seduc'd Old Adams Tree to tast, And with vaine Fruit to break their needlesse Fast. Because Gods Word, whereby they might be sav'd, They slighted, 'tis no marvell though they rav'd. But our New man wean'd from the Carnall Teat By Truths calme Breath, the Flaming Paraclete, With Drier Braine holds a Cleere Intellect, So solid, that he others can direct A safer Course of knowledge to affect Then what the Wind-mill grinds of Satans Sect. Though Natures sting in our Originall Hath made us prone into the Snare to fall: Yet we New-borne fight with the Spirits Sword, And triumph by the Second Adams Word Over the Dragons false enchanting Arts, With constant Faith repelling all his Darts, Those sober Cates contenting our repast, Which lawfull are for tender Soules to tast. We would seeme Inward more then Outward wise, Yet Both addresse with Saints to sympathize. For carnall Samians transubstantiate Change, (The Old Mans Quirk) the New man we exchange. Instead of Lethes Lake, or Phlegeton, We Tophets Paine sing due to Babylon. For Limbus Patrum, or th' Elizian Camp, Gods Paradise for Saints renewes our Lamp. A Dolphin bore Arion from the Seas; Amphions Harp, they say, did Thebes appease: But Jesus Christ the Third day to have rose From Josephs Tombe, we really disclose, Or by a Whale we Jonas bring to Land, Who Niniveh converted out of hand. For Cerberus, we blaze proud Satans Losse; For Hercules his Club, our Saviours Crosse For Triviall Tales, and sence-alluring Toyes, We read on Bookes Soule-ravishing to joyes. For Thalmuds we the Scriptures native sence; And for Nice Schoole-mens Glosse, in our Defence, We can produce by Truths Prerogative The Chiefest Starres of the Church Primitive, Or those, who in the Last and Present Age With Volumes rare repair'd our New mans Stage. To banish Humane Lies, and Brain-sick Dreames, What Tree more full? what Field yeelds riper Theames Then Christ his Life, and the New Testament? Or in her Swathes the Churches fragrant scent? This Lady here my New man marbles forth, Though fully not according to her worth, Yet so, My Lord, that you may cleerely see: Though she was long obscur'd, she now raignes free, Cloath'd with the Sunne, Crown'd with a dozen Starres, And no Eclipse you from her Influence barres. But out alasse! how many boast of Faith? Who never markt what Christian Scripture saith: For what is Faith without Good works, or Fruit, But a dead Stock? not worth a Moores pursuit? Unlesse he dreames of Mechaes fond Delights? Or Millenairs to snare Voluptuous Wights? Or of vaine works of Supererogation, Soules to bewitch with Babels Fornication? Our Saint is not with such Conceits defil'd, Nor turnes with such Extravagances wild, For he well knowes, that as good Trees will bud, And beare good Fruit, so Saints doe alwayes Good, And never scorne to greet the Simplest Man; To call home Strayes they labour what they can. Such is our Saint the Naked he attires, And helps to warme their Soules with zealous Fires. According to his Power great or small, He saves distressed Saints from Tyrants Thrall. He sues for Peace, and grieves to see debate. And daily prayes Lawes Rigour to abate. If he be forc't to Law in his defence, He doth it without spleen, or Saints offence. And if his Clapper hap to clatter wild, Before Sun-set he growes more Calme and mild; Or if that Filmy Piece in others blabbs His shame, he counts it like the Noise of Drabbs. He sets not out his Lipps to Farme, nor slander, Nor lets his Tongue before his Wits to wander. He holds his Word as pretious as his Seale, And scornes False Cards unto the Least to deale. He dares not plot Revenge, nor scoffe, nor raile, But beares with Knaves and Fooles for Saints availe. He covets no mans Goods, but if at Play He winnes, He gives it to the Poore away. He spends his vacant Howres in thrifty Course, Lest Idlenesse corrupt him worse and worse. He prizeth Coine but excrementall Drosse, And toiles for Others Good, though with his Losse. He doth his Best to curbe Promooting Scribes, Lest God require of him their winkt-at Bribes. At Night he scores the Deedes he did that Day, And the next Morning scowres their rust away. The Sabbath, like the Puritan, he waighes, And, like the Papist, keepes the Fasting dayes: The Former mindes him of the Spirits Mart, The Latter helpes to stint the Sensuall Part. He daily strives so to compose his Minde, That seldome him doe Idoll-passions blinde, Nor cause him long to doat on Pleasures shape, Be it a Horse, or Hawke, a Dog, or Ape, He kindly speakes, meanes well, doth good to all, But most to Saints, and helpes up them that fall. God root these Works in me, lest whilst his Way I others teach, my selfe a Cast-a-way Become, like him, anothers Floore that sweepes, And yet his owne New house most nasty keepes. The Heart still moves: It Loves and spreads with Joy Or wrung with Gall and Griefe it feeles Annoy. The Former flow, because Gods Flames inspire it, The Latter chance in absence of his Spirit. Of these Affects our Inward Man partakes, Amidst his Joyes sometimes his Spirit akes: Yet his Griefes smart spring not for worldly Cause, But for mens Breach of the Creators Lawes, For the Encrease of Idols, Avarice, Of Drunken Healths, or the like Heath'nish vice, For Concords Breach, for Christian Blouds effusion, For losse of Time, our Talents vaine profusion; Or else because he sees the Church of Christ Opprest by Fiends, and Saints by Antichrist. Sometimes he feeles strange Qualmes, neer destitute Of zeale-bred heat, till entring to dispute With his Proud Foe, he like One cheer'd with Wine, Threats him with Thumps, to make his Pride decline: He calls him Monster, Belly god, and Slave, And vowes his Fare to shorten, if he rave. With Davids Sling he knocks Goliahs downe, For standing out against his Masters Crowne. Though he enjoyes an outward faire Estate, And seemes to some to be most fortunate; Yet in his Mind he waighes the Cause, th' Event, Mens Frailty, and his owne coincident, Whereat he Lion-like for braver Prey His Courage lifts at full, not giving way To poore Conceits, but to the Noblest Ends His Cares, his Thoughts, and his designements bends; Which he Effects by a New Sacrifice To God, who gave those undeserv'd Supplies With knowledge of his Mysteries Divine, And Prudent Rules Old Passions to confine, When Thousands of his Brethren want that store, Who would perhaps have glorifi'd him more, And never ceas'd, like Angels here on Earth, To praise those helpes, since Others dye of Dearth. His Spirit scornes that which the Body joyes; And checks that Lump, because it did rejoyce In Alery Toyes, in things meere transitory, Which draw the Sence from the bright Sun of Glory, And like to Golden Clouds may passe away By Humane Plots, or by Death in a day. He reapes Content to see his Neighbours thrive, And their Amendment doth his Soule revive, For he the Poorest Saint in Christ preferres Before the Greatest Potentate that erres. He Joyes, that he breathes of the Common Aire; Which is allotted for the Saints repaire, With whom he sings, grieves, and Communicates, Aswell for Sacred Rites, as Needfull Rates. He Joyes, that he had learned from his Youth, Like Timothy, the Word of Sacred Truth, That taught to serve One God, One Advocate, He could not brooke of Balaams Snares to prate. He Joyes, that he no raking Money owes, Then what to pay he or short warning knowes, Without grim Sergeants Threats, or Suerties Thrall, Or without Robbing Peter to pay Paul. He glories more of Soules and Bodies Health, Then in the Blaze of Honour, Fame, or Wealth. To cheere his Noblest Part he soares aloft, And viewes the Starres of Holy Stories oft; He Courts the Of-Spring of faire Memory, Aswell Divine as Humane History; By which true Glasse he findes how short and vaine Those Pleasures are, which Wordlings hold for Gaine, Though Cause of Paine eternall after Death, If not before of Dolour-racking Breath. Another while Wraths Comet to prevent, Which he observes with burning Arrowes bent To aime at change, by Learned Art he strives To blunt their Shafts, and into Physick dives Aswell by Prayer as by Galens Quill, With Zealous Heart, as by Arabian Skill, Like Good Saint Luke, for the Foure Humours foule He studies Cure, as Solace for the Soule. For which Intent, and the Complexions Good He forbids Food, which might inflame the Bloud. For what exceedes the Temper Oily warme, Or Mayes mild Heat he knowes breeds after-harme. Lest Nature droupe, he breathes his Pack-horse oft, Not on the Rheumy Vale, or Marish soft, But on dry Hills to suck most wholesome Aire, There, with Pure Gales the Spirits to repaire. While Gulls fly out with Golden Wings excesse, He lives at home content with Fortunes lesse, Not daring by Anothers Idoll-store To mete his wants, where Saints do languish more: And if he should lash out in Pompe like those, His Pompe and Store would cause him after-woes, When the Great Judge requires his Talents use, With strict Account of Stocks and Times abuse. He Drinks no more then doth a Saint befit, And ever riseth with an Appetite, For, as a Type of Blessed Abstinence, He Joyes to sing of Diets Excellence, And to relate, when Girald liv'd, that they Of Cambriaes Soile did feed but once a day; As how the Greekes thought Platoes Tale a Lye, That twice a day they meal'd in Sicily. No Beauty, Wine, nor Musicks Harmony Contents our Saint more then Good Company, Knowing their Vowes, and mutuall Hearts Consent Availe him more then Worldlings Blandishment. To end his Joyes, on this he sets his Rest: That a Good Conscience is his daily Feast. These harmelesse steps a Christian ought to tread, And the same Life I strive and hope to lead. And if these Rules My hopefull Nephew scan, He then shall passe for a Right Noble Man, Excelling vulgar Wits as Porcellan, Course vessels, as the New the Outward Man, By Vertue rankt within True Honours File Among the brave Heroes of this Ile, Crown'd with a faire and brighter Coronet, Then One with Gold and Pretious Stones beset, And be so skill'd in Both the Fortunes Cures, That Poore mens Cries tend not to You nor Yours. While Vengeance strikes a Nembrodizing Lord. And his Proud Race with Fates two-edged Sword, Like Mordecai, unwearied in your wayes, You shall weare out on Earth most happy Dayes; And after Death when they feele endlesse Paine, You shall with Christ in Peace for ever Raigne. Such blisse pursues a Pious-minded Peere, And such I hope attends you there and heere, Which to seale up, and to set forth Your Traine, Heere take your Choise of Posies various Straine: Without the New-mans Robes none are indeed True Noble-men, but borne of Mongrell Seed. “To be borne Great, great Honour some esteeme it: “But to doe Good I greater Honour deeme it. “Vertue so farre excells Sires Heraldry, As doth Day-light the Darke, the Sap the Dry. “A Noble Minde surmounts a Noble Birth; But who hath Both shines like Sunne on Earth.

THE CHVRCH MILITANT HERE ON EARTH FOVNDED AND RENEWED BY OVR SAVIOUR CHRIST. Who is this that comes from Edom, with red Garments from Bozrah? Esay. 63. The Argument. The Church is built on Christ, who under-went The Curse, Rose up, and then to Heaven went. This wonder-rapt some Angels of that Spheare, That they with Joyes speake of his comming there. The 1. Age. In Paradise the Church of Christ began, Wh? after Breach God opened unto Man The hopefull meanes, whereby he might deface The Sting of Sinne, and bee restor'd to Grace; If on the promise of the Womans Seed Man would rely, he might redeme his Deed. But Bloody Cain with his accursed Race Went Whoring after Satan, sleighting Grace. And then the Church in Seth, Methusalem, In Noe and his Arke, in Godly Sem And Iaphet fix't: from whence no liking Cham She downeward past to Iob, and Abraham, And settled in the Circumcized Ligne, Vntill the Promis'd Seed with Light Divine And Gospels Sound arriu'd, graft things anew, And by his Crosse our Charter did renow. The Gentiles then by his Apostles blest From Heaven gain'd the Holy Ghost for Guest, To cheere their Church, within her to reside, And evermore her Christian Broode to guide, As long as they Him for their Rock protest, Whome Peter thrice for all his Mates Confest. So Thousands did with Angels Gifts encrease From Age to Age, and found in Conscience Ease, As testify the Pulpet and the Presse, Which holp our Church to bloome with good successe. So Others, since the Word late came in vse; Inspir'd have wrot and Preacht of Faiths Abuse. And so likewise we see, that in our Dayes Some feele the Heare of that bright Spirits Rayes. By them our New man reapes the Fruits of Truth, Transformes Old wily Age to Saintlike Youth, Mary for Eve, for Adam Christ he sings, Whose Blood then Abels speakes forth better things, Entrancing Soules with Gifts Propheticall, And otherwhiles with Numbers Sphericall, That by those Meanes and sweet enchanting Layes They might confirme themselves, as call home strayes. At first, like Babes with Bells, smiles mixt with threats, He weanes the weake before their Sence he beates With Zealous Charmes from worldly vanities, Adapting them for purer Qualities, Which our Good Sire with Metaplastick Mould Stands ready to infuse more fine then Gold. This Prudent course Some take in Verse as Prose For stilling Swarming Bees, or Stubborne Foes, To winne Applause to their more waighty work, Which in their Braine, like ember'd Fire, did Lork. They tickle first with smooth Conceptions Youth, Laurell their Name, and then gaine Roome for Truth To spread without Repulse, or sowre Distast, Before they dresse rare Manna for their Tast, Clozing their Feast with Healths from Sions Fount, Like Petrarch, Beza, and Mirandols Count, Who with ripe Fruite by good mens Suffrages Ransom'd their Froth, and greener passages. Such Wits I wish with Lines of Sacred Truth From Carnall Dreames to scare our Straggling Youth And such I hope by Grace here to produce, As Types of Vertue drawne for Holy use. On the Lords Day, though not with full content, I late sung Christs from Olives Mount ascnt Up to that Orbe, whose height no Earthly Scribe Can by the Booke, or Astrolabe describe. Though Galilees new Glasse a World espies Within the Moone, yet Moone-sick are the Spies, While clog'd with flesh, not Spirit-rapt, they pry Into Gods Thrones Transcendent Mystery. At Heav'n I glaunc'd, wherein his Man-hood rests, Preparing Roome for his Beleeving Guests, Who su'd to Christ, Mens Advocate alone, Not parcelling his Worship into halves, As Iewes for Moloch, Baal, and Golden Calves; That so the Sabaoths change at Pentecost Succeede with Gifts sign'd by the Holy Ghost, The Comforter, which should the Church renew, And grace thenceforth the Gentile and the Jew, Till the Returnes, as Man-Emanuell Within the Cloudes to Iudge the World and Hell. Here now againe with Fiery Flights I hover, And his Ascent more spaciously runne over Then I did late, because our Church hath drest And cookt upon another Day this Feast. The way of Christs up to Gods Orbe Ascention Transcends above fraile Natures Apprehention. I dare not wrest Christs Body, nor confine His God-head. There, He Raignes a Man-Divine, As Man He sues for Men. As God he sends The Holy Ghost to gratifie his Friends, And by Infusion heere his Church to grace, If we Beleeve, and Love, and Pray for Grace. Although as God his Presence never fayles us, His Bodies Absence heere yet more availes us, As he is Man, or else his Bodies Sight Had made us Carelesse of the Spirits Light. His Manhood by his owne Experience saw Our Natures weakenesse, &amp; how Fiends would draw Us from Gods will, and from true Innocence, Whereby none could avoid Hells Pestilence. Unlesse himselfe did stand within the Gap Betwixt our Sinnes and Wraths fierce Thunderclap; And that made him remove his Person hence To Heaven, there to ease our Punishments, By suing to Gods Grace, as Advocate, That for his sake he would repayre our State. Great were the Angels Ioyes, when Iesus came In humane shape with such Imperiall Fame Vp to th' Empyrean Sphere, where none before Of that New Forme could like a Phænix soare. As by his Crosse lay husht Hells damned Crowd, So wondring heere Some Angels sung alowd: Whats He that mounts, and sits on Gods right hand, With Bozraes Robes, come from red Edoms Land? Clad like to One, who hath the Winepresse trod, Yet looking like unto the Sonne of God, Who did ride on the Cherubins and fly, Yea, fly upon the wings of winds most High? Perhaps He is a New Melchisedeck, God's Spouse to grace, or her with Gemmes to deck? Or else the Cause of this New Mans Ascent Might be her Vowes and Offprings to present; Or for her Strayes to sue as Advocate, Those whom the Gospels Light reclaimes of late. His comming here with such Triumphant Port Doubtlesse to Men Salvation doth import. This Mystery and Ioyfull Spectacle Above all Wonders prove a Miracle Vnparalell'd, that by Divinity Infus'd in Flesh, men gaine Eternity; And that the Gentiles, as the Iewish Tribes, In Truths rare Secrets grow most learned Scribes, Pertaking Grace without disparity, Made onely Iust by Faiths dependency, Not by their Owne, but by Anothers Deedes, Tis strange how they are clear'd of their misdeedes. What sparkling Eyes more beautifull then Wine? Whose Teeth like Milke? whose Body lookes Divine? Of mild Aspect, yet of S. Michaels strength Prepard, to Plague and foile our Foes at length? Whose Haires more white th? Wooll, or the full moone And whose bright Face outshines the Sun at Noone? Whose voyces Tunes like silver Brookes resounds? And whose faire Feet like finest Brasse doe sound? O what is He? a Prophet? Prince? or Peere? Who in mans shape climb'd up our Highest Sphere? And there instal'd with the Divinest Light Weares now a Crowne more bright then Chrysolite? What can he be then said Others, the Lord, Who to save men became th' Incarnate word? And having led on Earth an Humble life? He hath trod on the Dragons Crowne of strife? Who Preacht to Soules with hideous Mists perplext, Yet for his Love by his owne Nation vext, Who slaine at last by Romes Authority, Yet spite of Hell Rose up with Majesty? This New man God the Third day rais'd from Death To be our King, and Comforts more to breath; Who made Light things, or Spirits, to descend, Now upwards holp Christs Body to ascend; Whose Body now we see Incorruptible, Most Glorious, New, of strength Invincible, Divine as well as Humane, not with hands Of Mortalls wrest, as Errour understands. Yet his long Hands, I meane, his Spirits Armes, Extend to shield his Church from deadly Harmes. His clearest Eyes all Penitents behold, And his white Teeth doe Temperance infold. His Silver Haires his knowledge Ripe declare, And his bright Face foretells his Favours rare. Out of his Mouth flowes Truths melodious Word, But his just Wrath darts forth a Lightning Sword. From Heaven He survayes each Holy Place, And raps with mystick Trance Men chang'd by Grace. At their great Feast He is the Soules Colleague, In Spirit matcht with Hypostaticke League As really, as in One Horoscope Two Soules that plight with hands their mutual Hope, Whilst up to Him with Thankes she lifts and heaves Her Ravisht Thoughts, like Wheates ripe eared sheaves, For Captive He hath led Captivity, Gives Gifts to Men, and doth their Chaines unty, Dissolving quite lewd Passions Linkes a sunder, Like knots of Eeles, or Swarmes of Waspes by thunder Supreme there He all Creatures overswayes, And there in his high Manhoods Person stayes, Till All th' Elect, the Gentile as the Iew, Seal'd up for Grace come in, and till they rue With shamefull Guilt their Rancour, Guile, &amp; Pride, Who his pure Word and Deity still deride. His Garments red shew, that He trod alone The Winepresse, how in Need him succour'd None. His Robes likewise resembling Bozraes Graine In Crimson dipt, imply, that Men againe Will in his Members him oppresse and gore, As they their Head and Master did before, With Aspicke Tongues hir'd to empoyson Fame With strife and Losse, or Plots surmizing Blame Whereby weake Natures Brood torne by Dissention Might lose the hopefull use of Christs Ascention; Or with Crosse Flames more fiercely violent, Them in their lives last Period to torment, Because false Christ's they would not every where Kisse, and adore Christs Body heere, and there. Bvt leaving them for Antichristians Limbs, Let us applaud, and greet with Ioyfull Hymnes The Reall Forme and Body of the Lord From mangling now to Lasting Life restor'd; This Crowned Lambe, the first Fruits of the Dead, Whom God ordain'd to be our Prince and Head: Great Iesus Christ borne on Sinnes necke to tread, And to divide the Right from the Misse-led: The Sonne of our Iehovah Elohim, Whom Saints their Saviour call, and None but Him; For unto Him our Maker hath resign'd All Creatures sway with Power unconfin'd, At whose dread Name all Angels, Saints, and Men Must bow, and at his Praise vent forth Amen, Not onely with loude sounding Tunes expression, But likewise with Loves Inward Flames impression. The New mans Cloze of Thankesgiving for our Saviours Ascending up into Heaven. All Glory be to God for evermore, Who with New Layes hath multiplied our store, And taught us by the Holy Ghost to finde Where Christ remaynes rais'd in his Humaine kind. That the New man put downe our Carnall Sence, Twas well therefore that he departed hence, His Body rapt till Doomesday from our sight, Let by his great Victory infusing Light With Wondrous Gifts on the Apostolick, And ever since on the Church Catholik, Or more or lesse, as She with Zealous Hope Dayes Turret climb'd, or in Nights vale did grope. For these high Flames more bright then Sunny Rayes We sing to Three in One, New Songs of Prayse. THE MOST MEMORABLE OCCVRRENCES, WHICH hapned in Our Christian Church, from the Thirtieth Three yeere of Our Saviours Incarnation; and from the Eighteenth yeere of Tiberius Cæsars Raigne the Roman Emperour, untill the yeere of Our Lord 100. at which time Trajan the Emperour began his Raigne. The Argument. Behold what Thanks from Worldlings worse then Mad For Preaching Truth, the chiefe Apostles had. Not One escapes a sad Tormenting Fate, Which holpe to build at first the Churches state. VVhat better Fruit can a New Sparkling Muse Produce then Holy Odes for Christians use? Then by th' Apostles Glasse of Peace to chime? Or from late Iarres to scare the World with Rime? O would I could, like Roman Arato, In English Tune such Labours undergoe, As might display th' Apostles Acts and Lives, Gladding our Age with their Pure Honey-Hives! Which spite of Drones, False Brethren, stormy Blast And tortures stood through watchings, vows &amp; Fast Forear'd against the Foemen of the Crosse, As to prevent from Hell ensuing Losse. Although our Latter be not built as well, Nor may that Church in Glory paralell, Yet our Good Will availes in stead of Spice, And our New man helps us to Sacrifice; For we have had our Martys, like the First, Yea, and the Living Rocke to quench our Thirst; We have beheld the Spirits Lightning Sword; Onely, I feare, we want the Flames of Love, Which Primer Saints with mutuall Heate did move. This want Some may with their Ambrosian Food Supply, sound forth, and publish for our good, If, as they have begunne, they warble out What I to bring about do stand in doubt. This Taske Pauls Faithfull Mate in Physicke skill'd, Though more for Soules then Bodies Cure, fulfill'd Sacring two Workes to Greeke Theophilus, As Monuments, and by his Lamps to us; He left them us to shew what Legacies The Heavens lent for Christian Sacrifice. Thence, as his Ape, by Imitations straine I hope some Light for Brittaines Church to gaine, At least to serve as Sparkes, Babes to revive, Who faile for want of Torches store to thrive. When that our New-mans Sire, the Holy Ghost, With Cloven Tongues, like Fire, at Pentecost Hurl lighted on th' Apostles visible, As he some times inspir'd invisible Gods Prophets: then Faith, Love, and Christian Ioyes Waighd Delphick Dreames, and Babelsiarring Noise; Then, Men that learnd no language save their own Amid 'strange Folkes rung forth the Lords Renowne And blaz'd his deedes in every Forraigne Tongue, Like Angels Quire, with sweet harmonious song As perfectly, as they their Natives were, So that those Aliens stood entranc'd with Feare, For how could they but be agast to heare Iewes speake with Tongs peculiar to their Eare. Some Others deem'd them Mad, or Drunk with Wine Till Peter prov'd them rapt with Joyes Divine. He prov'd them rapt by Gods immediate Rayes, With Ectasies above all Humane wayes, And not alone the gifts of Tongues, but Zeale To Preach they had, and without Drugs to heale Some Prophesi'd, some Sung, whil'st others told What wondrous Acts the Lord performd of Old. Those Mystick sparkes, which by Degrees we learne God then infus'd, as of more Blessings Earne, To paralell Iob, Abraham, Salomon, For Patience, Faith, and Wisedome thereupon. O who can blaze the Wonders of that Day? The more I muse on them, the more Dismay Suspend my Sence, Lord, rayse up my desires, To sing th' Event of that Dayes Glorious Fires, Which comforted the Gentile as the Iew, Enrich'd the Barren Will, made Old things New. By such rare Signes came first the Mystery Of Three in One, the sacred Trinity To be more knowne unto the Church on Earth, And since Old Rites were past at our New Birth, That she might name at her solemnities The Holy Ghost Colleaged to Baptize. His working we agnize, feele, and admire, For who but He could stony Hearts inspire? Soone as with Gifts this Holy Flame appear'd, Souls Chaos melt, and their dull wits had clear'd, Gods Word then from Melchisedechs choice Towne, As from the Earths fixt Meditullium blowne, Pierst Egypt, Greece, Damascus, Babilon, The Temperate, yea, and the Torrid Zone, Where Negroes, though of Circumcised Race, Converted by an Eunuch looke for Grace. The Gospell pierc'd each Countrey and each Towne, Truths Sound went forth to all the world then know, Whereby no Nation might excuses pleade, But that they might be linkt with Christ their Head. With like successe the Christian Faith did bloome, And flourish there where brave Triumphant Rome Prepard the way by Morall Arts and Aw, That Grace Mens Hearts might so the sooner draw. While tatling Newes fond Athens itch'd to tell, The Romans dri'd her Aristotles Well. These Second Meanes for Planting Christian Rites, In those dayes much avayld Romes Proselites. Arts usher Faith. Faith quick by Hearing growes, But most of all when the Good Spirit blowes. There wanted none of these in Ancient Rome, Where vowes &amp; teares for Grace had purchas'd roome. Rome was the Empires Head, Great Cæsars Seat, The Westernes Mother Church, where then complete From Salem shone the Crosses radiant Starre, Which in Pauls time enlightning neere and farre Transferr'd on Linus, Clemens, Anaclete, The Martyrs Crowne with Flaming stones beset, And thence bespred Truthes universall Course, For then all Men to Tiber had recourse. But though I much commend Old Christian Rome, I should forget my selfe and Christendome, If that faire Towne of memorized Fame Which first profest to beare the Christian Name, I chance to passe by vnsaluted now, Not doing Homage which all Christians ow. Had I rich Tassoes veine to set her forth, Or Godfreyes strength to vindicate her worth, I would possesse all Christians Catholicke, That Antioch was S. Peters Bishopricke. And that it well becomes a Christian Knight, Who first bore Christian Badge to doe her Right. I would redeeme her from proud Ottoman From Muffties sway, and Mechaes Alcoran. In Iewry Land arose the Gentiles Light, From Antioch came the Name, which Fiends doth fright And shall out last all Names, untill our Head, As God and Man shall judge both Quick and Dead, Till Christ resignes to the Supremest Mace, To All in All, his Intercessors Place. This Light and Name the Sire of Antichrist, In Envie unto Man, and spite to Christ: With his Blacke-Guard that were depriv'd of Light, And for their Pride enwrapt in Errours Night: They all conspir'd, and strove to prejudice With all their Might, the New-mans Sacrifice. For this designe, their Malice to effect, They seiz'd the wits of Annas and his sect. They first plaid on the soules of Saducees, And gull'd such Braines as idolld Golden Fees: Christ in his Limmes to Crucifie againe; And all for Pomps support and worldly Gaine. The Creeple rais'd in Iesus Christ his Name, By Fishermen, that wonder put to shame The Iewish Scribes, so that they burn'd for Ire, And fear'd least Christ might dim their Levites Fire, Or quite abate their Old Traditions Gaine, Which holpe their present Glory to maintaine. At first they silenc'd them, and then with Gall They thundred out big words sesquipedall: That if thenceforth they acted Miracles In Iesus Name, they would as Spectacles Of Infamy their Bodies publickely Afflict, or make them in Iaile-Shackles ly. But since th' Apostles them regarded not, Nor car'd for Threats, nor scourging, then they shot Their Church-Darts out of Excommunications, Till a Law Doctour calm'd their Combinations. By this Advice, that no Devise of Man Might stop the Will of God, do what they can. On this the Levites rested for a while, And ceas'd their hands with Murther to defile. The which Advise if Romes late Catholikes, Had waigh'd for them whom they call'd Heretickes, Rome might have held a Reverend Mothers Sway, She had ere this turn'd Easterne Nights to Day: Where ministring now scandall to the Turkes, Both they and we detest their Bloudy workes. For Ten Yeares space, till Claudius Cæsar raignd, The Scribes lay still, their spleene a while restrain'd, And seem'd to winke at the Apostles Fame, Whilst in that breathing-Truce the Christian Name, The Church encreas'd, had all her wants reliev'd, Antioch receiv'd, Samaritans Believ'd, Yoppa rejoyc'd, Cæsærea gained Grace, And many Iewes joyd of the Christian Race; Aswell the Gentiles, as the Circumciz'd; Ioyn'd in One League for Christ to be Baptiz'd. In that Good Time Saints gaped not for Gold, But liv'd in Common, their Possessions sold, And without Guile the Price did distribute, Whereby they barr'd the Cause of wrangling suite, Of Mine and Thine. Their Care was Bread and Wine For sacred use, and for the Heavenly Vine; To build Christs Church upon the New-Mans Rock, Not on the Sand, False Keyes, or stumbling Block. What Wonders wrought they of stupendious sort Above fraile Sence? Or Carnall wits Report? By Words they made the Cripled wight to walke, The Dead to Rise, Blinde see, the Dumbe to talke. By Words they strooke a Lying Couple Dead, And Blinded One, who men by Charmes misseled. Through Iesus Name they wrought such Miracles, And freed themselves from Tyrants Manacles. The Fame of such faire deedes in Salem rung, As Nettle prickes the Envious Clergy stung. That Gentiles should partake with Israels Tribes Of Gods good Grace, they brookt not without Tibes. They flouted that the New-mans Troupes aswell, As their Old Scribes should tame the Fiends of Hell. And the most part, like unto snarling Curres In Manger lay'd, found fault with Others Cures. Repining thus at Progresse of the Word, Since that no Trickes could stop it, by the Sword Zebedees sonne they caus'd to lose his breath, As theyby stoning wrought the Deacons death; By Cæsars Minion King they weav'd their Plot, Who would have cast on Peter the like Lot, But that an Angel came to free his Chaines, To Plague with wormes the Tyrant for his Paines. This puts my Muse in mind of Phillips Queene, Who wreakd on Saints her Gall with swelling spleene, Till with her Gods, her States, and Calleis Losse, She felt the weight of a more heavie Crosse; And of the Royall Brothers styl'd Valois, Who di'd in Blood for Blood, and Bloody Ioyes, Iberiaes Rings can testifie likewise, What they have got by Belgiaes bloudy Cries. More mild yet dealt Agrippa with Saint Paul, Not barring him from Romes Appeale at all, But would have join'd with Festus to enlarge, And save for his Appeale him to discharge. Much lesse would once that sage Prætorian Peere For Words &amp; Names the Iewes mad Clamours heare. How many Snares with Tumultes, spite, and Rage Did they spread forth for Christians in that Age? By all the meanes, which Satan could devise, Men sought to stop the New Mans Sacrifice. But all in vaine, like trod on Cammomell It grew the more, and with a fragrant smell. Not Elimas, nor Magus with Hell Charmes, Nor could Dianaes Smith knock down their Armes, Or quench in them the Holy Spirits Flame, Which they conferr'd in Jesus Christ his Name, That like themselves at first Enthusians rapt, For Holy Trances they made others apt. Vnwearied they in their Vocation went, And acted Deedes to Arts astonishment. No by-respects to Glory, Wealth, or Ease, No Emulations Sting could make them cease From the Pursuit of the Immortall Prize; No servile Feares, Detraction, nor surmize, Could let their maine intent, and Ghostly Race, From setting forth Gods Charter of free Grace. No Chollers Heate, Debate, nor Casuall Brawle, As fell betwixt Saint Peter and Saint Paule For Iewish Rites, as likewise came to passe For Chusing Mark twixt Paule and Barnabas; Or as it chanc'd to Abraham and Lot: Their Passions sway'd not so, that they forgot The Progresse of the Word, the worke in hand, But that they ranne, and toil'd by Sea and Land. In Accidentalles, though as Men they err'd; Yet, as Divines, the substance they preferr'd. Their Elder Man they stoupt in spite of vice, And their New-Man went on to Sacrifice. Here Paule and Silas Preach, Apollos there, While Barnabas and Marke, doe teach else where. Mathias, Iude, and Simon burn'd alike To execute their Charge Apostolicke. With the like zeale all the Apostles rapt Transformed soules for Mysticke Trances apt. They Catechiz'd, and sought their Saviours Praise, Their Soveraigne Ioyes were to reclaime some Straye With Constant Faith the Gospel they did blaze, And daily wrought great wonders of amaze; Till by Romes Mace the Type of Antichrist, Which slue their Master Christ, they di'd for Christ. In all their Deeds they were so farre from Pride, That when some Gentiles would have Deified Good Barnabas and Paul with glorious shout In stead of yeelding thankes they ranne about With cloathes all rent among the wondring throng, And beg'd of them the Deity not to wrong, Nor by detracting from their Makers Grace With Sacrifice his servants to disgrace, They vilified themselves, tooke up the Crosse, Contemning Pompe and Gold, like seumme or drosse. They varnish'd not Gods Word with Glosse of schooles But sought the wholsome spring, not Muddy Pooles, And spar'd their New built Church to interrupt, With knotty doubts of Phantasies Corrupt. Now for a Type of their essentiall Care, I will produce this One Example rare, When Proselites of Pharisaicall sort, Would Gentiles to strict Moses Lawes exhort: In Salems Councell the Apostles sate, And in few lines resolv'd their Questions state: Whereas by some ye were perplext with Feare About Old Rites, we warne you to forbeare From Meates Prophane at Idolles Sacrifice. From beastly Lust, or Wives Pluralities, From strangled Flesh, and shedding Humane Blood, If as your owne, yee Carke anothers Good: And do abstaine from the said sinnes withall, Yee shall doe well. By Barnabas and Paul, And two of the Chiefe Brethren moe they sent These Pithy Actes the Gentiles to Content. Whereby I note on Weaklings they impose No heavier Yoake then what the New-man chose. They combred not the Church with Needlesse Lawes, Nor with Traditions Superstitious Flawes. They could not brooke Food drest with Satans sauce Nor at Christs Feasts to glut their hungry Mawes. Thus we observe how easie is Christs Yoak, That to cleare doubts Faith beares the Sovereign strok Faith linkt with Love requires us to forbeare, And not for Toyes Christs seamelesse Coate to teare. How wondrously did the Good Spirit breathe The New-Mans Gifts, from darkenesse &amp; from death To raise up soules? and Heathen Clouds to cleare? Dispersing Christs Disciples heere and there? By visions He Immediate lighted on Cornelius and Saint Peter, both for One Affect, to let the wavering Gentiles know, That God tooke care within their Hearts to sow His seed of Grace, which stubborne Iewes abus'd, And Christ their Head, Gods husbandman refus'd: And that without respect of high or low, He loves all them, who to his Service bow. What Travels did good Peter undergoe? By Sea and Land he did undaunted goe, Though wanting meanes, unfurnished of Money, Not for himselfe to gaine a Patrimony Of corruptible mould, or brittle Masse, Which like fond dreames in time away doe passe? But for his Master Christ soules wrapt with mists, Of Ignorance he made good Catechists, Good Catholicks Apostolickes he made, Instructing them in his Soule-fishing Trade. And as some write, when Simon with his Whore. Silene brag'd, hee like a God would soare Above the Clouds, by Peters vowes he fell, And brake his Necke, left by his Guard of Hell. To Iewes and Gentiles He the Gospel taught, But chiefly he the Iewes conversion sought; Deputed for the Circumcisions Charge, Unto the Elect disperst hee shew'd at large The Patent of his seald Apostleship; Yea, and, if Fame belies him not, his Ship And Fishing-nets hee left at Tibers streame, Where some then sojourn'd of Ierusalem, As in the Acts wee read; there he baptiz'd, (If there he was) till Nero tyranniz'd. Now whether Rome hath cause of him to boast, As for his seate more then the Holy Ghost, Which living Peter gave to men of Faith, Some since have strove, not following Peters path: 'Tis certaine, that he wore no Triple Crowne: None kist his Foot, nor trod he Princes downe. 'Tis knowne, that Gold and silver he had none: A Tanners house was of his Lodgings One. Tis credited, that to the Crosse he bow'd, A kind of Death which onely Rome allow'd, Till: Constantine in love to Christ forbad This cruell paine and spectacle most sad; That being Old against fraile Natures will, Others did Peter lead his Bloud to spill, As Christ foretold; but his Crosse-fixed place (Romes Empire lay so large) I dare not trace. But sure I am Saint Paul in bloudy Rome, When Nero raign'd, endured Martyrdome. There, having twice before that Tyrant stood, His Faiths Defence he sealed with his Bloud About the time when that mad Boutefeu, Had fir'd the City with his wanton Crew, Because he long'd to sing the sacke of Troy, And by such Types would execute his Toy, To cloake the Fact, and stop the Mutiny, Yet not repenting of his villainy, He authour'd Christians of those dismall cryes, And butcher'd them to bleare the Peoples eyes. Among that guiltlesse Troupe then suffered Paul, Who had fore-wrote what should him there befall. This chosen Saint hath left brave Monuments Unto the Church, which Satans Ambushments Can never trap, nor Canker-fretting Age Consume, but they stand firme in spight of Rage. In Albions Orbe an arched stately Roome, The chiefest Pile, I thinke, in Christendome, Of Pauls sole Name, revives his memory, Till Doomes-dayes blast the River Thames shall dry; In the meane time grave Saint-like Ministers, Accompanied with Asaphs Quiristers, Sing praise to God for gracing of Saint Paul, Who once had beene a bloody-minded Saul. Of late repair'd it shines with zealous Fire, As erst with flames rag'd the stupendious spite. Blest be their Zeale, their Cares, and good Intent, Which have re-built this famous Monument, Resembling that of Salems Second one, Renew'd by Iewes, first built by Salomon. Like these, so did all Christs Apostles, Fish, And on some Coast or other never misse To catch for Christ some choise and dainty Prey, Bartholomew and Thomas knew the way Into the East, and there engrav'd their Names. Saint Mathewes Paines sev'n flouded Nilus fames; And pretious Iohn the Belull Abissine, From him and Philip claimes Christs Faith Divine. Achaia vaunts of good Saint Andrewes Cares, With whom he pawn'd his Bones, till those rich wares, Some Scottish Saints by a Greeke Monke redeem'd, Them and their worth, like precious Gems, esteem'd. While Mark from Peters mouth Gods Word compile, To leave it her, Niles Alexandria smiles, Sea-spousing Venice too did sacrifice Unto Saint Mark a goodly Edifice. The latter James, Christs kinsman by the flesh, In Salem liv'd, disorders to redresse, Where hee, though stiled just, as spectacle Of shame, was throwne downe from the Pinnacle, Which Satan mov'd to Christ. There he expir'd, And Roman Force the place soone after fir'd, Yet hath his Fame to after-Ages spred, His Bishops Seat with Christians flourished, By Princes grac'd, and for Antiquity Puts Antioch downe, and Rome's Priority. At the First Councell Iames sat President. There, Saint cloz'd up the Circumcised Rene. In Salem sate the High Commission Court, Where they decided doubts of most import. Galicians since built up a sacred Fane At Compostell, which later Wits profane, Adoring Iames, as if Humanity Should offer Vowes due to the Trinity. About the Time of Iames his death, to shunne The Fatall Web for sinfull Salem spunne, Upon the Siege the Christian Iewes sore-warn'd. By Oracle from Christ, fled thence unarm'd With Humane helpes, but guarded by Divine Supplies, themselves to Pella they confine, Where they on Iordans Banks securely lay, While Rebell-Iewes were slaine, and sold away. So stood the Church with them, who flourish'd first, Next Christs Ascent most pure, untill accurst, The Iewish Nation for their Crying sinne, And hardned Hearts deep woes were plunged in, And then God pleas'd for Iewries unbeliefe, The Gentiles to adopt to Iewries griefe, And our Church seemes to them a stumbling sinne, Till all th'Elected Gentiles be come in: As unto them of Antichristian Race She seemes, till Babel feeles her last disgrace. But why were Saints, like Christ, so foulely slaine Because the more they suff'red here, more Gaine They reape, the Nobler Crowne in Heav'n they gaine; And shall judge those, who put them here to paine. If you would know by Times Gradation mre, Domitius and Domitian yeelds you store; Read Tacitus, when Rome lay wast with fire, How Christians felt the Formers Franticke Ire: Some crucifi'd, some burnt, and some were cas'd In wild beasts skins, by Mastives torne and chasd So cruelly, that who did them contemne, In hate to Neroes spleene then pittied them. Though Christians were to manifolded paine, Throughout the twelfe yeere put of Neroes Raigne, Yet like to Palme supprest, the more they grew; The Church the more by Martyrs did renew. Pathmos with Romes whole Empire tells what paine, The Church endurd in the last Flavians Raigne, With greater Numbers Martyrs Calendar Canonizing then in mad Neroes yeare: During which Rage some Brethren false did rove, The Deacons Sect, lewd Family of Love; And hee that durst afore Christs Darling bath, But felt the Doome of his incensed wrath; The Bath-walls fell, crushd Cerinthe underneath, As soone as Iohn had menac'd him with death. THE OCCVRRANCES OF THE SECOND AGE From the yeere of our Lord 100. untill the yeere 200. At which time Severus raigned Emperour of Rome. The Argument. Saint John deceas'd, Fiends Seedes of Error sow, Yet doth the Church, though persecuted, grow, And from her Wombe spring up a Learned Crew Of Saints, who with their bloud do Truth renew. He that desires a Saint-like Life to lead, Let him the steps of ancient fathers tread, Who neerest liv'd unto th' Apostles times; Thence I collect the Course in Raptur'd Rimes, Which Christ his Church then for her members held; What Pathes they trac'd, and wherein she excelld, If wee mislike her Plainenesse, or their Marts, Love bids us chastely gaze, and winke at Warts; For like the Moon at full, sometimes the Church, Raignes knowne from her, who lives upon the lurch, Dispersed through the World, Apostolicke, Yet, like our God in Three, one Catholicke, In sundry shapes repleat with sacred Fire; With many Tongues, in Spirit yet entire And Essence one; who, though diversifi'd For Rites or Forme, remaines yet justifi'd By Faith with Him, who tryes mens Consciences, Beares with their slips, and heares her Grievances. Returne, quoth hee, Yee people full of strife, Who Me have wrong'd, like a rebellious Wife. Alluding to which challenge in his Word: Before the Lord and Angells I record, That I beleeve no Church on Earth this day, Then Britaines Church goes a more Knowing may. In substance pure, and in her good intents, Seal'd rightly with the Newmans Sacraments. And with the Best her Elders I conferre, Yet dare not say her Troupes doe never erre, Not brag that shee hath neither Mole nor Wen, While shee cohabits heere with mortall men: But pray, that she in Fruit more pregnant thrive, As shee in shape is like the Primitive; And that with flames of mutuall Love wee glow, As forward as in height we seeme to grow. One thing I adde against her Foes in briefe, And therewithall to ease our Weaklings griefe; Although I honour with my heart and Pen, The Couneclls, Fathers, and the Ancient men, Who wrote before the seventh Century Became bewitcht with Babels Mystery, Yet we no more give credit to their Lore, Their Matter, Tropes, and Topick Maximes store Derived from Old Adams double Tree, Nor further then wee finde them to agree With Gods owne Word, or Oracles Divine, Dare wee consent with them in every Line, For men may erre, yea, Learned Councells erre By Factions sway'd, as other whiles they were; And, as Eusebius markt, the Church began To be unchast, soone as th' Apostles ranne The Hower-glasse out of their lives Pilgrimage, By Cerinths Toyles, and Nicholaites Rage; Or by those Fogges, which Epiphanius brands For Heresies of Antichristian Bands; Or Sects, whose Augustine expells the mists, Be they Pelagians, or the Donatists. At the New Rising of the Second Age, In the First yeere came Trajan on the Stage, Adopted Cæsar by good Nervaes choise, Broiles to prevent, and Cares to counterpoise. In his precedent Raigne Domitians Act Against the Church in Rome was somewhat slackt; But otherwhere the Prætours for their Gaine By Christians goods escheat, renew'd againe The Old Decree, and in their Liberties Practiz'd on Saints their former Cruelties. But leaving them a while to racke and rage, I now glance on the Wonder of that Age. Of Him I sing, who would have kneeled downe, But was forbod, unto an Angel, knowne Of all the Apostles longest to have seene The Churches course eclips'd by Tyrants spleene. One while assail'd, anon strong Militant Iohn saw her curbe Conceits exorbitant. Thou hast, O glorious Saint, beheld her Pure, Like to the Sunne dispelling Clouds obscure. When Shepheard Pan deceas'd, then Oracles From that time ceas'd through Christian Miracles; For when Tiberius swayd, Fiends waild their losse, While they shipt Tamus forc'd to bruite the Crosse, And to proclaime in Midland Seas with dread: That Pan, the great God Pan, was newly dead. Thou hast surviv'd thy Brethren, and thy Mates, Thou hast beheld strange Turnes of worldly States, The Temple sackt, Ierusalem destroyd, Thy Native soile all harried and annoyd, Thou liv'st to see weedes of blacke Heresies, Amidst the Church spring up, Apostasies Growne rife, the Saints with Persecutions slame Scorcht every where, and put to open shame, Thou hast our-dar'd a dozen Emperours, Since thy good Lord triumphed over powrs, When thou beganst to shine, Tiberius raignd, They saw thy Lifes sun-set, whom Trajan paind. What dangers, wrackes, and buffetings of Fiends, Hast thou oft felt? What snares of glozing Friends? Portents to make the Patientst Iob dismaid; Thou hast out-liv'd thy Charge, the Widow-Maid, Thy Mother deare adopted on the Crosse, To thee his Minion left, to ease thy losse, When therehence out thou tookst her to thy house, As a true Nunne, to helpe thy Christian vowes. How long shee liv'd with thee, to calculate, An Angel must the certaine Time relate, Or name the Place where her Blest Body lyes, Whether she was in Body Enoch-wise, Immediately to Heaven assumed up? Or dwelt with Iohn till Age made her to stoup? And payd her debt as other Mortalls doe To Nature, much it skills not us to know? Since now with Christ her Soule Triumphant rests, And as her Life deserv'd with him the feasts: Admitting no such Mediatrix style, Or Goddesses, as some themselves beguile, That she doth oftentimes command her Sonne To heare a Sinners suite, or Orison? Save that I might be into Whirle-pooles brought, Or for my Guesse be too Sagacious thought, I would Conjecture at the Time when Iohn, Before the Siege of Salem undergone, Departed into Corinth, Ephesus, Or other Coasts, where Titus and Timotheus, Were by Saint Paul ordain'd to Over-see, There, to confirme each Saint in his Degree, As they by Him, who all those Churches bare Upon his shoulders first, were bred with Care. There, he consum'd the Remnant of his Age, Untill to Pathmos by Domitians Rage Confin'd, he saw in spirit Christ againe, Who then and there by Revelations plaine To his Rapt Sence, though hid from Carnall Braine, Did prophesie the future Churches staine. For Comfort of th' Elect the Lord appear'd Unto this Saint, and his Wits Sences clear'd, To understand what plagues he will effect In the last dayes for his true Words Neglect. These Mysteries Christ opened unto Iohn, Whom he reserv'd so long. And thereupon I humbly glance by leave of Holy Wits, To whom my Muse her Raptures here submits: That when One asked Christ, what Iohn should do? Whether he should remaine behinde or go? His Answer was unto this bold Assay: If my will be to have him here to stay Untill I come, what matters that to thee? And long he staid, as all may cleerely see. Before his Death he did so settle things, That Greece his Praise aswell as Asia rings. In Nervaes Raigne he came with his Release To Ephesus, where he deceas'd in Peace, While Trajan sway'd, as Græcian Clearks relate, Having escap'd an Oily scalding Fate, Impos'd on him by fierce Domitians Rage, Who then exiled him to Pathmos Cage, Where, though cub'd up a while from Christians sight, He saw what cheer'd his Soule, His Masters Light. Both in his time, and after, soone began The Divels Plots to scare the Christian man, Which Valentinian and Menander spred, And many moe, which Weaklings then misled: For whose Mistakes Saint Irenæus griev'd, Two hundred yeeres ere Epiphanius liv'd, To blazon them and other Heresies, Which then obscur'd the New Mans Sacrifice, After Saint Iohns decease, till Adrian raign'd, The Roman Prætours still the Christians Pain'd, Who so confirm'd were for the Fiery Crosse, They fear'd not Death, nor Paine, nor Fortunes Losse. The Truth when rackt by Inquisition strict, That Christians much were wrong'd by Romes Edict, Great Trajan then did unto Pliny write, To mitigate the Fiery Trialls Spight; Yet not to spare them, if they were brought in, (Damn'd policie so cloaking Bloody Sinne) In which implicite Snare Ignatius bound, Like Christs fine Corne, by Lions Teeth was ground. Next after this, the Second Century Points at some Saints of Glorious Memory, As Pillars of that Age, with whom as Chiefe, Succeeding those fore-nam'd I ranke in Briefe A Martyr'd Sire of Naples Palestine, One that foretold his death to Antonine, When shortly after did a Cynickes Hate Conclude with Flames the Swans Prognosticate, Having first wrote, to calme the Emperours Spleene his Defence, and to Romes Senatours. In Iustines time, which by the yeeres account, Since Christs Ascention up from Olives Mount, One Hundred shone, good Christians liv'd content With simple Meanes, and scorn'd the Blandishment Of Gaine or Pompe, with all false worldly Wares: But fixt on Christ, and Cure of Soules their Cares. Platoes and Moores Eutopiaes Common-Wealth, Compar'd to them seemes but Promethean stealth, Phantasticke Dreames, or Speculations Flame, Which being unpractiz'd breed the Authours shame. They taught and wrought with Reall Charity, As if that day they were arraign'd to dye; Not like to Stoicks dissembling Lookes austere; But against Sinne with Discipline severe, With Vowes and Fasts the Outward man to tame; Not for Repute, or Superficiall Fame, But with intent to keepe their Vessels pure, And to seale up their Christian Calling sure, They promis'd not but what they did performe, And squar'd their Deedes to the Apostles Forme, Such Pious Deedes with Zealous Sparkes beset, As I for Saints have in my Preface set. From Justines Workes likewise I apprehend The Eucharists Religious Use and End: We take no Common Bread nor Common Wine, (Saith he) but like as Christ by the Divine Bright Word became true Flesh, and for our Good, Tooke on him our Attire of Flesh and Blood, So we by Vertue of his Word, Record That Food to be the Body of the Lord; Yet Sacramentall Wine and Sacred Bread, Which have our Soules by the Remembrance fed. With this short Course the Prefect of the Feast, Insinuates Vowes into each Sacred Breast; They fed with zeale: the Throng Thanksgiving sing, And Deacons did unto the Absent bring The Consecrated Food, that they likewise Might have a Taste of the Soule-sacrifice: Such was the Ancients Forme, to distribute The Holy Food without Quirkes or Dispute. In those Dayes Crosse to Food blest by the Word, Was Sacrifice of Flesh at Heathens Boord To Idoll-Gods, which Christians did refuse, By reason of the Cursed End and Vse, (As we likewise that Carnall Food despise, Which some Create a God at Sacrifice) And yet the Food, ere it was so disgrac'd, Could not pollute the honest Takers taste. So when Gods Word hath blest Ours to record Our Saviours Crosse, it quickens by that Word, Which full of Life breathes Spirit, Life, Reliefe, If it be tane by Soules firme of Beliefe; For otherwise the present Ectasy Doth uanish, and away those Blessings fly: They at their Feast Emanuels Presence lose, His Presence, whose rare Forme some Clearks appose. Though they beleeve, that Christ is God and Man, And stiled God with us, his Forme they scan, And question, how could Paul and Stephen see Emanuel, while on Earth Men living be? As to the Pure this Mysticke Trance turnes Pure, So tis Damnations Bait to the Impure. And when Faiths Feast becomes a Sacrifice To Idoll Gods, it tends to prejudice; For this grave Cause good Christians doe refuse False Altars Meate, where Satan Poison scrues. What shall I write of Mark Aurelius Raigne? When all his Campe distrest for want of Raine, Were at the point to perish, Christians then, By Miracle gain'd showres to save his Men? While hopelesse Pagans dig'd, by Prayers they Gain'd in One Night what they had toyl'd by Day. Such wondrous Deedes of the Church Primitive, Like those Blest Showrs, will cause our Muse to thrive, If therewithall we moisten Thirsty Soules, Which long to taste of our Nectarean Bowles, In hope from Bruites to be trasnform'd anew To better shapes, then Ovid could renew, Or Samian Forge. Our New-Man sings more strange, Of Manners, not of Bodies, the Exchange. Within this Age liv'd Irenæus knowne A Bishop, where France built her Lions Towne. He stoutly did the Marriage-state defend, Whose Foes, he writes, blame God and Natures End. He taxed Romish Victors Lightnings Flash, And quallifi'd his Squibs denounced rash, Which he presum'd against the East to throw, For Easters Date with Supercilious Brow: (Or did perhaps not excommunicate, But barre with them Rome to communicate.) So likewise did Grave Policrates blame His Censure-causing Schisme, and Christians shame. This Reverend Man, to win the more Applause For his Defence of that propounded Cause, Demonstrated, that his seven Ancestours, And he the Eighth from those Progenitours, Were Bishops all of Ephesus, and held Their yearely Course of Easter unrepeal'd, Implying, that his Lineall Holy Race, Confirm'd the Truth to cleare that wrangling Case. Next unto those shone Athenagoras, Tatian, and He, who with his Sire would passe To Martyrdome, and but for Mothers Teares Partake, like Adamant, not shrunke with Feares. He gloss'd Gods Word, &amp; would have bin more priz'd, If he had not too much allegoriz'd. Severus sent for him (such was his Fame) To Antioch, where he stuck to Christ his Name, And blaz'd his Word with such rare Eloquence, That he return'd by Cæsar grac'd from thence, Dismiss'd with Gifts, and Courtiers good report, He came againe to the sev'n Flouded Port, Where he much Oyle in Alexanders Towne, Consum'd, untill his Errour put him downe. Where well he wrote, no better Writer knowne: Where ill, none worse then Origen is showne. Famous for this: he termes Christs Flesh and Bloud The Spirits Type, his Word Soule-quickning Food; Most infamous for this: that first he Gelt Himselfe, and then for feare he should have felt A Buggering Rape by a Black-hired Moore, He Sacrific'd to Idolls (a farre more Scurfe-spreading sinne) for which with Bolts accurst, By Alexandriaes Church, to Teares he burst, When lighting on a Text in Salmes Towne, And there desir'd to Preach, he found his owne Unhappy Act by Lot, nay by Divine Appointment: How the Precepts which are mine, Dar'st thou presume within thy Mouth profane To teach or read, O thou ungodly Man? Upon which Text poore Origen abasht, With Teares his Crime and his Presumption washt. THE STATE OF THE BISHOPS OF ROME DURING THE TIME OF PERSECVTION, and while they were subject to the Emperours. It may be heere some Curious Wits expect, That I their Lives and Deedes should recollect, Whom Priestly Votes heve voyc'd for Roman Popes In Peters Chaire, on whom they fixt their Hopes To binde and loose their manifolded Crimes Both then and now, and in ensuing Times. But such a Taske I dare not undergoe, Nor will I have with Fraudfull Styles to doe: The Servant when of Servants One proclaimes Himselfe, and yet a Monarques Power claimes. Let them who build on Flesh and Blouds Desires, Entangling their Beliefe with needlesse Fires Of High Ambitious Thrones, not warranted By Gods deare Lambe, who for our sakes here led An Humble Life: Let them I say bow downe Before the Gold-cross'd Shooe and Triple Growne. But I am sure they no Record shall finde, Nor Chronicle, that mentions in that kinde The least Reflexe of Royall Majesty Due to Romes Popes with Both Swords Soveraignty, Untill the French the Lumbards overcame, Till Charlemaine did Desiderius tame Since Phocas Time they Nine score yeeres before, Above all Priests the Chiefest Miter wore: Since Constantines, who Phocas did precede Three Hundred yeeres, a Patriarchs sway I read They had heere in our West. But till that Time They scarce found space to breath, much lesse to climb, Or claime a Mace, and to be called Lord, A Style, which Christ forbad, and Saints abhorr'd; For till the Raigne of Constantine the Great, Thirty they were, which grac'd Romes Pastours Seat, And of those Thirty Bishops there were None, But they were slaine, or did through Troubles grone. As English Saints were in Queen Maries dayes By Tyrants spleene distressed sundry wayes, Imprison'd, rackt, and put to Open shame, Depriv'd of all their Goods, and burnt in Flame: So Christs New Church, tho with rare Dowries blest, Neere for Three Hundred yeares was sore opprest. Cæsars without, and Herteickes within, Did persecute, and plunge her Members in So many Toiles, that hardly they could meet In Private Place, nor one another greet With Common shewes of Neighbours Amity; How then could they thinke on Priority? And stand on Points of Prelates Primacie, Without distrust of some Conspiracie? The Truth is this: who were styl'd Bishops then, They fish'd not for fraile Wealth, but Soules of Men Not to enrich themselves with Private store, But like Saint Paul, the Crosse they thought on more From Christian Cæsars they got Liberties, But not so great to claime Regalities, About the Yeare Sixe Hundred sixty sixe, We finde that Rome began to play more Tricks Then she durst act within the Ages past, As Paul and John fore-told her Breach at last) And never left to lift her Lofty Crest, Till she Gods Word had darkned in the West, And dar'd upon the Cæsars State to prey, The maine great Let to her Prodigious Sway. She never ceas'd to stirre up raging Fires, Till she at Trent concluded her Desires, Repugnant to the Vow, which she profest At her First Rise, Sixe Hundred yeares at least, At such wild Fits I onely glance, not carpe; This Taske I leave for an iambicks Warpe. THE OCCVRRANCES OF THE THIRD AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 200. untill the yeere 300. At which time Dioclesian and Maximinus raigned Emperours of Rome. The Argument. Next to the Greekes the Latine Scribes begin, Idolaters unto Christs Church to win. Romes Tyrants fret, and Saints they martirize. Saint Anthony into a Desart flyes. Within this Age the Church most Militant And Cautious, strove to shun exorbitant Attempts of Foes; one while to secret Caves Constrained to retire; sometimes to tame the Braves Of her owne Tribe, Domesticke Mutineers, Shee us'd the Spirits Sword; Anon the Jeeres And Flouting Scoffes of Forrainers to daunt, Which did at her Poore Robes and Altars taunt, She fought against Cætilius and his Traine, And prov'd their Vaunt for Outward Glories vaine. Her State was then unsetled, New, and Poore, But Time to come might make her flourish more. A thousand of such Taunts and Fiery Darts, A Thousand of great Dangers, Envious Arts, By Satans Plots she daily underwent, While Cæsars sought their Pagan-Gods Content. The neerer that the Church drew to her Time Of Liberty, least that too high she climbe, Satan suborn'd his Agents in this Age, Against her Race to shew their utmost Rage. He knew her Thraldomes Date to Iohn foretold, Would shortly end. And that made him so bold. As otherwhiles a Woman Chast and Faire. Dishevel'd seemes, or with loose dangling Haire: So without Art, and in her Native Dresse The Church at first for want of Time to dresse, And to compose her Outward Ornament, Came forth to spread her Saviours Testament, Not carking much for Superficiall Weare, But in the Heart the New Mans Gifts to beare; And yet both Chaste and Faire She comely shone, With Constant Faith built on the Corner-stone. And though she liv'd and raign'd of Men unseen With Carnall Eyes, yet of Good Angels seen, Heard in the Quire, which to the Lambe belongs, Answer'd by Saints with Sympathizing Songs, Nay, seene and knowne of Men Reborne anew Both then and now, who never kneel'd to Baal, But to One Christ, the Saviour of us all, Who by his Word, and bright Diurnall Light, Hath late disperst the Tempests of the Night, Sav'd us, like Peter, out of Herods Iayle, From Babels Powder-traine, for Saints availe. For which sweet Grace, redintegracious Love, The Saints on Earth with Those of Heaven above, United in One League shall ever sing Melodious Songs to our Triumphant King. Our Latine West unto the Church of Greece, Acknowledge must her selfe in some degrees Inferiour and oblig'd. From her she had the Forme Of Christian Rites false Altars to reforme, As she the Substance from Ierusalem, More neere to Greece then Rome, the Church Supreme, From her she borrow'd her prime Words of Art, Those Second coin'd Intentions, to impart From Man to Man by Termes, Discourse, and Tongue, What otherwise would dormant lye unstrung. Her Noblest Name of Christian Catholick, The Eucharist, the Faith Apostolick, Types, Symboles, and Ecclesiasticke Lawes, What be they but Greeke words for Christian Cause Disguis'd in Latine Robes Faith to expresse? And to worke on Mild Hearers more or lesse? The Sev'nty Scribes translated Iewries Ioyes To the Greeke Tongue by Philadephus Choise. Saint Paul and Luke divulg'd in Græcian Tone Christs Mysteries, yea, and Saint Iohn wrought on His Auditours in Græcian Vestiment, Fit in that Age to further his Intent. Greece more to praise, ere Rome saw Christ his Light, Some Greekes of Philip crav'd his Masters sight. No marvell then, that Greeks, ere Latiuists Did publish Workes, fought in our Christian Lists With Infidells against their Rites obsceane. Towards the Period of the Second Sceane, To celebrate this Age, Tertullian rose, With Tullian Phrase to daunt the Churches Foes, False Heretickes and Jewes, whom he refells; And but for Dreaming Fasts his Part excells, Whilst he 'gainst Marcion makes Christs Body good, Truths Figure, not Imaginary Food, Since Figures shew not false, but things indeed. And in another Place, quoth he, We feed By Hearing on the Word Incarnate blest, With Understanding chew, through Faith digest. Saint Cyprian him succeeds, who famous made By Monuments, which cannot faile nor fade, The Churches Union, and the Martyrs Crowne, Which since himselfe receiv'd in Carthage Towne. This Saint bids us the Holy Bread to part, And breake by Faith, not with sharpe Teeth nor Art, While we confesse: That, which is broke to Parts, Divine-Humane both God and Man imparts. Out of his Bookes we cull, at Carthage Towne How he did fret, and all the Councell frowne To heare, that any should Romes Pope install, The Bishop of all Bishops Generall. Next after him Minucius Fœlix came In Roman Robes, Cæcilius overcame With Dialogues, and foil'd his Heath'nish Dreames. So did Arnobius by the Spirits Beames, In the like Garbe the Gentiles Rage abate; And shewes the Cause, why Christians Idolls hate. By Fabian Bath'd. He grac'd this Centers Age, Who first of Cæsars wore the Christian Badge. Long had the Church been rackt with bitter woes, In travell, like a Woman tir'd with Throes, To bring that faire Light forth, and Blessed Birth, Which in th' Elect shines with Harmonious Mirth, The Inward Man, I meane, whose Praise we sing, Grac'd to that end with Will by Heavens King. Through all the Roman Empire tortured, And by fierce Tyrants hands sore Martyred In every Age during her Pilgrimage Heere in this World, untill Maxentius Rage, Became supprest by zealous Constantine, She felt what Dioclesian, Maximine, And what their Prætours could impose of Force Upon her Limmes without their least remorce She felt, Christ in his Members felt againe, What Hangmen could inflict of Hellish Paine, And what their Predecessors could inflict Upon her Lambes by Proclamations strict, (Prefiguring our late New Christian Fry, Whom men professing Christ in Flames did fry) And yet they fail'd by their Decrees severe, Or Wolvish Decius them to daunt with feare, But that in midst of Paine, by Satan stung, They to the Lambe Allelujaes sung. Slighting the Gridiron through the Holy Ghost: Now chuse thy Flesh, quoth Lawrence, Raw or Rost. Faire Theodora to the Stewes confin'd, Her Friend holp her to scape in Masked kind, Stay'd in her place, He thrall'd, she came againe; Yet did the Iudge for Martyrs both arraigne, Mauger all Rackets and Flames Saint Alban here In Brittaine first, and Noble George appeare, Who arm'd on Horse-backe with a Sanguine Crosse Leagu'd Salems Knights, and oft scar'd Englands Foes, As Ancient Wits conceiv'd their Aiery Signe, Like that, which meteour'd once to Constantine. Which Signe they might more fitly to their Head Impute then with his Members quartered. Their Crimson Gore transform'd to Robes of White, By vertue of their Faith Beames-darting-bright. With Amphibale they live yet in our West, And with those Twaine, whom of her Martyrs Best, With sacred Bayes at Vsk Carleons Towne Saint Aaron, and Saint Iulius still doth Crowne. Within this Age, like to th' Essences Sect, Good Men of Life austere did Cells erect Of Christian Hermites, or Anachorites, In Ægypts Desarts, there, that Convertites Might solitaty dwell, from Passions free, And from those Baites, wherewith we daily see The greatest Part, ev'n of the Churches Brood, Ensnar'd (a Mystick Point not understood By Libertines in these our Carnall Dayes) There, cloystred up from foule Temptatious stayes Alone and farre from Mortalls Company The Holy Saint, the long-liv'd Anthony, His life sustaining onely by the Fruit Of one Palmitoe Tree, whose Rind did suit And cloath his Limmes, as did the Fruit him feed. His Patterne then good Saint Macarius trac'd, Whose Presence since the Nicen Councell grac'd, O happy Types! If Superstition since For Hypocrites Some came not to convince; As Savoyes Hermite through Confessions shrow'd, Since Cuckolded the Best of all the Crowd. About the end of this Third Century, When Dioclesians Rage and Butchery Did persecute the Saints, God raised up Lactantius to confirme them not to droup, For now their Time of Liberty drew neere, Which by Gods Grace did after soone appeare: For saving Philip, whom Pope Fabian blest, All Cæsars hitherto Christs Flocke opprest. The Church as yet fixt on no Constant Formes Of Government. So grievous were the Stormes Of Persecution rais'd by Tyrants Rage, The First three Ages of her Pilgrimage, That she could not Correct, but now and then, Judge, nor with Tythes reward Industrious men. As Lollards were by our Lancastrians curb'd, And Huguenots in France by Kings disturb'd, So her aw'd Starres durst scarce a Synod call By stealth, much lesse a Councell Generall, Where her Chiefe Watchmen of the Christian Race, Might Congregate in one convenient Place, Popes stood not then on high Prerogatives, Glad oft to flye, to lurke, and save their lives: But Christians now began to be more bold, The Time in the Apocalipse foretold, The two and Forty Monthes being full expir'd (Monthes counted for Yeares Sabbaths) they aspir'd, By the Imperiall Leave to settle things In Order without Gall, or Envious stings, As shall appeare after Licinius Death. Meane while Ile rest, so to resume more breath. THE OCCVRRANCES OF THE FOURTH AGE, From the Yeare of our Lord 300. untill the Yeare 400. being the Second Yeare of the Raigne of Arcadius and Honorius the Sonnes of Theodosius the Roman Emperour. The Argument. The Glorious Church, which Constantine built up, At his Decease, by Arrians vext doth droupe. For Schooles Restraint of Julian she complaines, Which Rise againe through Theodosius Paines. Though I be slow the Strumpet to unmaske, Yet I contend to blaze the New-mans Taske, And to performe enough to satisfie My Noble Friends, where the True Church did lye. Since Christ his Time untill our present Age, Mauger Hells spight during her Pilgrimage: Because she did on no Foundation stand But Christ, none shall her Name with Errour brand; Because she built upon the Living Rocke, Which Peter voucht, she shunn'd the Fatall shocke Of the fierce Dragons Floud, in Darknesse shin'd, Though to a Desart rude she seem'd confin'd. Because she squar'd her Doctrine and her Rites According to Gods Word, her Opposites Can never blacke her Fame and Memory, Nor need she feare Proud Babels Mystery, That Errours Spirit can obliterate The Gospels Text, which she enjoyes of late. I will make good, that though some Curse &amp; Ban her, Yet by Gods Rayes, or his Saint Michaels Banner, She spreads Christs Name, in Saints and Martyrs blest, In Dangers oft, and seldome times at Rest; One while in Tents, in Warres against her Foes: Another time beleaguer'd, feeling woes, When seeking Christ in time of superstition, The Watchmen smote her in the Inquisition, As Salomon sung in his Canticles; As Christ himselfe by Scribes Conventicles, And Roman Doome in person felt what Grace His Limmes with Men finde in their Holy Race. By Martyrs Bloud and spoiles of the Old Man, Our New man first his Sacrifice began, Continues still his Feast, though some conspite To marre the same, and Our Good Church to fire. And yet for all Mens Hate, our Mother lives, Yea, from her Flames the New Man buds and thrives, Not much unlike the Phœnix, whom they say, That being burnt her Like revives alway, Though alway not so Vigourous or Faire, By reason of the Climate, Food, or Aire, Too high Conceit of her splendidious Worth, Or of the Keyes to shut the stubborne forth; Or other Accidentall Lets she seeme But vile, or lacking Tythes, in poore esteeme, Nipt with hard Winters Frost, on scorcht with Heat; Course Dyet, or with changing Soile or Seate. Yet at the last the Bridegroome in extreames Shewes her the way to his spirituall Streames, To pray with Zeale, more cautiously to watch, Least Fiend-like Pride her or her Brood attache, To feed his Flocke, though they ungratefull be, Combining to keepe backe his Tythes, her Fee. For whether Poore or Sicke by dankish Aire, She sleepes not, till she doth to Christ repaire With contrite thoughts, and Lusts Mortification, With the New-mans and Soules Resussitation, Of whom she begs, and humbly sues for Grace, Which on her Teares she gaines, then sees his Face, The splendour of his Spirit working wonders; With mildest Gales restraining Sinaies Thunders; And thereupon is throned on a Hill, With large Command, according to his Will. To Bind or Loose her Childrens Sinnes, to keepe, To watch, and Feed, but not to Flay his Sheepe, Like her with Triple Crowne on seven Hills, Who with false Fires now sits as God, and fills Mens Consciences with Smoaky Pardons, Wares Of the Beasts Marke, with Lies and Bugbeare Cares. About three hundred Yeares the Gospels Light, Had through our Saviours Bloud acquired Might And rooting, when restrain'd it faster spred, Enlightning Soules whom Forged Tales misled. When he had foil'd Maxentias, Maximine, And to a Nooke Licinius did confine, The Christian Church was rear'd by Constantine, Most Glorious on a Hill, with Rites Divine, And decent States, as well from Foes Contempt, As from home-scandalls to become exempt. Soone as that Signe had meteour'd in the Aire, Which Conquerour him styl'd, he did repaire The Ruines of the Church, recalled home Those whom late Tyrants had proscrib'd from Rome. Such Grace she found: But soone her Sonnes forgot To thanke our God the Author of their Lot, Who had inspir'd th' Imperiall Majesty With Zeale to serve One God in Trinity, And at the Nicene Councell to restore By Publick Acts what prostrate lay before, To build up Temples with large Liberties, There, to serve God with Vowes and Sacrifice, To chuse Grave Mitred Sires to over-see, Least Christ his Flocke by Wolves should scared be, And by Decree to quash all Idolls downe At Synod held in Eliberis Towne. This Course he tooke by his Good Mothers Lore, Whose Birth much Fame to Brittaine did restore; And Helens Name deserves to be engilt, For finding Christ his Crosse, for Temples built. Five Bishopricks he rais'd to mighty Height, Whereof each One possest a Severall Right; And None of these in one anothers Charge To meddle, but their owne Taske to discharge, O're-seeing their Proper Flockes. The Chiefest Roome He gave the Popes of New and Ancient Rome: The Third he granted to Jerusalem: Then Antiochs fell and Alexandriaes stem. This stinted Course they long observ'd, and None Swarv'd from the Stem at Nice agreed upon, But Brethren-like liv'd in true Amity, Not striving for more Seates Priority, Then Constantine out of his bounteous Grace Allotted them in their distinguish'd Place. The First, that sithence kickt, was He of Rome, Who at Bizantiums Councell would become The Chiefest Priest as of Old Rome the Pope, Sometime the Empires Head of spatious scope; The which the Pope of New-built Rome gaine-sayd, And there to hold the Prime Place he assayd; At which Vigilius did so powre and frowne, He would not meet with them, though then in Town. Thus they, who should a Lowly Minde possesse, Began to climbe to Lordly Loftinesse, Perverting to wrong Sence the Living Rocke, Gods Word, the Keyes, and Feeding of Christs Flocke. That they might raigne here in this World a while, For a few yeares pufft with a Princely Stile: When they know in their Consciences they Erre, That after Death they fall, like Lucifer. But they for Faith lean'd unto Humane worth, And scatt'red Doubts against Gods Spirit forth. They mutined against the Holy Ghost; Apostate Arrians raung'd through every Coast. They soone forgot the Mysticke Crosses sence, The New-mans Vewes, and the Words Excellence. Their Plenty pufft them up, and the Sunnes Light Bedazzeled them, like Gazing Birds of Night. For the True Substance, Shadowes they ador'd, For the Creator, Creatures they implor'd. The late Baptiz'd enur'd to Pagan Rites, To Saturnalian Feasts, and Idoll sights, Could not away with that Religions Forme, Which typing Christs their Lives ought to reforme, Their Flamines grudg'd, that the New-Clergy held The Conquest over Soules, themselves expelld. The Lay-men wav'd betwixt the Old and New, Like Æthiops loath to change their pristine Hew. To punish these, when Constantine was urg'd, Not so, said he, Mad men should rather purgd By Physicke be. We must, though Curres do bark, With Gentle Gales to Port bring Christ his Ark. This Prince, when he Paphnutius saw at Nice, His Hollowes kist, whom Foes depriv'd of Eyes. The Roman Empire was most fortunate Under his Sway. He rais'd Romes falling state To such a Height, that never Kingdome since His Paralell enjoy'd, nor any Prince Succeeded like to him in Pieties True Practice, farre exempt from Avarice And Crying sinnes. His Palace with the Poore Then with Prætorian Bands abounded more. He was not serv'd in Gold or Silver Plate, Though he might set on all the World a rate, But Earthen Vessels or of Wood he chose. He curbd himselfe, because he would not lose His wavering Subjects hearts. And what he spar'd Above the Pensions of his Souldiers, Guard, The Publike Troup, and his owne Private Charge, He yeerely did conferre the fame at large To Pious use, and Temples up to build, But more Christs Living Temple to rebuild. Blest was the Church while, his good Monarch raignd Having Peace, Freedome, Wealth, and Honour gain'd. But after his decease by Arrians vext, She like a Widow stood long time perplext, But not with Open Force, for Satan then Was for a Thousand Yeares from Murthering Men, For the Faiths sake begun to be restrain'd, Yet so, that Saints for Tryall might be Pain'd. Since I my Taske for Constantine have spun, I must not leave Constantiaes Web unspun. This zealous Princesse, whether Fancies Flame, Or to become Corrivall of her Fame Who late had found the Crosse in Calvary, Or Satans Plot into her Creed to pry, Whether these Tempting Baites wrought on her Will, To shake her Faith, and her Best Part to spill: She sought the Picture of our Saviour Christ, As if her Creed did on the same consist. To bring to passe her Project frivolous, She wrote unto Euschius Pamphilus, Requiring him to send it her to Greece, To make her happy in that Graven Peece. The Holy Father with disdainefull Eye Perus'd her Lines; he feard Idolatry, Lest the Connivence at such Passages, Might blurre the New-mans Ghostly Images. He therefore answer'd her with Piety, In Zealous Lines, not without Majesty: Your Grace desires, Christs Portraiture to have, But which of his Two Persons would you crave? Which doe you meane (quoth he) His Shape Divine, That beares the likenesse of the First in Trine? Or else the Image of a Servants Forme, To which for us he did himselfe transforme? If you aspire his God-heads Shape to see, Take heed you touch not on Old Adams Tree; None knowes the Father but the Sonne alone, And none but by the Father knowes the Sonne. But if that Persons Picture you demand, Borne of our Flesh, you must then understand, That none by Art and Oily Colours di'd, Can limne His Bodies Frame now Glorifi'd; For since that his Disciples could not see His shining Face at Tabor, how shall wee View his bright Face and Persons Lineaments, Which till Doomes-day he hath removed hence? On this Monition the Good Empresse staid, And of such Carnall Types became afraid. While Luke-warme Thoughts contended much with Zeale, False Arrius crept into Christs Common-weale, Where Six score yeares his Sect Good Men so griev'd, That in those dayes the Most part mis-believ'd. Two Councels then the Arrian side preferr'd, The Millaine stray'd, the Ariminian err'd: Yea, Bishops both of New and Ancient Rome, Subcribed, and to Hereticks gave roome. Against them all did Athanasius warre, And therefore may be stil'd That Ages Starre. By his true Zeale and Pen the Arrians quail'd, And Truth at last with Victory prevail'd. During Soules Time of Blindnesse, Satans Warre Began againe both neere at hand and farre. Against false Hearts, not by Blouds violence, But by fly Arts to try Saints Innocence. To dim the Churches Splendour, he sent out His flyest Fiends to compasse them about Mad Iulian he stirr'd up, till he perforce Did yeeld unto the Galileans Force: Where Magick Spells, nor his Deare Porphiry, Could stop Gods Doome due for his Trechery, Which unto Christians interdicting Schooles, Made Wits more hot, his Counsellors but Fooles, As bad prov'd Valens, since to Arrians sold, But Gothes by Fire purg'd his Presumption bold. What Iulian spoild, did Valentinian raise, And Gratian grace, But Theodosius Praise Deserves much more. He by Pope Damasus, And Millains starre did Arrian Tumults truth. Blest be his Name, who barr'd for his Amisse From Church refrain'd, till he gain'd Ambrose blisse, And though a King of Kings, yet not withstood Checks for rash Doome of Thessalonians Blood. O Godly Prince! who when he might command A Pardon, yet most humbly demand. Of him One sung: Each thing with him prevailes: So Winds Conjurd descended to his Sailes: For him the Heavens fought, the Waves went backe, And Natures course for all his Foes ran slacke. This Claudian blazd with Panegyrick straine, And Ambrose of his Death did much complaine: I lov'd this Prince, quoth he, because he car'd, More for the Church then his owne Weale regard. Much owes the Church unto his Memory, For after he had chasd Idolatry, And calm'd the Arrians Rage to Catholicks Content, he setled Christian Bishopricks, And least the Church for want of Meanes should fade, Confirm'd the Act which Good Iovinian made For Tythes to Pastours, which hath ever since Reviv'd the Fame of this Religious Prince. What Good this Act hath done in Ages past, Till Mungrell Monkes the Churches Hire defac't, Encroaching on the Clergy Seculare For their Support of Sloth and Private Care, Let Godly States observe, and waigh what Losse Ensues of Soules by such as doe ingrosse Impropriate Tythes, while many Thousands pine For want of Meanes to spread the Seed Divine. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE FIFTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 400. untill the yeere 500. At which Time Anastasius Raigned Emperour of Rome. The Argument. Priests Marriages Confirm'd. Foule Heresies Burst out. False Christians plagu'd by Enemies. What wondrous Wits that Age brought forth Divine. Now bloom'd the Irish Church and Abissine. That Parcell of false Babels Mystery, Broacht at the End of the last Century Inhibiting Priests Marriage, in the Rise Of this New Age returnes to Hell, and dyes. For while the Arrians Heat began to slake, Siricius made Romes Clergies hearts to ake, When he would them in the last Age constraine, To live without their Wives in Tantales Paine, Without their Plightd Mates, whom Christ had joy'nd As Type of his Church-Mystery, injoyn'd From Strangers sheets, as well with Holy Seed To store his Church, as to partake some Meed For Solace of their Lives anxiety, While they soil'd not Chast Society, Like Heathen Men, with Wives Pluralities, Or haunted Whores in surrepritious wise. But quickly was this Cloud disperst and gone, As not by Mortalls to be undergone, When Wiser Men condemned his Decree, And prov'd the Marriage State for all men free, Aswell by Lessons out of Sacred Story, As Nicens Warrant to Paphnutius Glory, Who though himselfe had never married been, Yet he to barre Priests Marriage deem'd it Sinne. And so the Councell held at Gangren past, The like Decree for evermore to last, That Married Priests might safely Minister, And who enacted otherwise did erre, With thundring Doome accursing every Wight, That dares maintaine that Tenets Opposite. Saint Nazianzen sung that he was borne, The third Yeare since his Sire a Priest was sworne. Though this and other Fire-drakes choake in snuffe, Yet did not Other Clouds leave off to puffe And poison Soules. Each One must have his Guard Of Angels two both Good and Bad, to ward Or tempt his Soule, that the Sect Manicbee Might conjure them, but not without a Fee. To ayde them with Free-will and Merits Charmes, Pelagius offers now to lend them Armes. For these two Sects together with the Mists Breath'd forth by Arrians and the Donatists, The World then suff'red condigne Punishments, In Lives and Fortunes with distracted Rents. That Ages Church was so with Heresies Beset, and from the Truth seduc'd with Lies, That though she fled into a Wildernesse, To sojourne there safe from their Wickednesse, And damned Plots, yet did the Dragon spew A Floud of Filth in hope to blurre her hew. But missing her he persecutes her Seed, And seekes by Open Force to slay her Breed, Which though he fail'd because of his restraint, Yet he prevai'ld her Luke-warme Race to taint. For this great Warre he rais'd up Bloudy Foes, Gothes, Vandalls, Hunnes, all prest at his dispose, By Rhadagase, Alaricke, Totilas By Him, whom Ætius foil'd, proud Attilas, Who had proclaim'd himselfe the Scourge of God, To chastise Mortalls with an Iron Rod; Besides the Vandall Arrian Gensericke, Who sackt at Austines Death his Bishopricke. By these whom Rome had sometimes kept in Thrall, God suff'red Fiends for Sinne to worke Romes Fall, To let lewd Worldlings know, that when they faile In Zeale and Love, then Satan will prevaile. Before these Stormes, when as the Church was like To perish quite, God grac'd her Catholike Againe by Meanes of Athanasius Creed, By Ambrose, Jerome, and good Austines Deed. Besides those Foure, how many radiant Lamps Did the Good Spirit raise against the Damps Of Hellish Fiends in that fam'd Century? From Gratians Time, till Zenoes Empery? No Age before nor since hath ever seene Such Lights to Crowne Theology a Queene, No Age more wise, more Learned Wits brought forth, Since the Apostles Time of better Worth Then those fore-nam'd, then famous Hillary, Theodoret, Eusebius, Gregory, And Basil his deare Mate, then Chrysostomes Rare Homilies, whose fluent Golden Tomes Ravish the dullest sence, Or who can share With Epiphanius? Or for skill compare With both the Cyrills, or with Emissene? And Others, who renown'd that Ages Scene? Extirping Arrians, and the Menichees? Daunting Donatus, and his Complices? And striving to keepe downe Pelagians Pride? Or for a time to stint their swelling Tide, Which but for them had sooner made the way For sale of Soules, and Antichristian Sway? These shone as Starres within the Firmament, And did then Satan in that Age prevent From his deep Reach. And we might doe as much, If next Gods Word upon their Stone we touch Discreetly without Passion, or selfe-love, Since Men are prone the worst things to approve Tempted by Fiends, which wheele about the Braine, To misconceive the Right for Worldly Gaine. Such bred in Errour from their Infancie, Will hardly see the Truths resplendencie. But soone relaps'd that Ages Proselytes, They whoor'd againe as did the Israelites. On which Relapse He that for Abrams Seed Could raise up Stones, a Stony-hearted breed, Stirr'd from the North his Blessings to partake, Which Christians soil'd. These did in time forsake Their Pagan Gods, and the True Faith embrac'd In milder Climes, which Hypocrites disgrac'd. At last they fell likewise through pamp'ring Ease, And with grosse Sinnes their Saviour did displease. So stood where Cæsars raign'd the Churches state: But now I must looke backe where Belul sate, The Southerne Queenes Successour, Sabaes Heire, Who was Baptiz'd in the Fourth Hundred Yeare. Long had the Church of th' Equinoctiall Line, Candaces Clime, since stil'd the Abissine, Been tost on Nilus Lakes by Mungrell Windes, Compos'd of Iewish Rites and Heath'nish Mindes. But not those Stormes allay'd, attonements made, That Christians might through Circumcision wade, And each partake of Others Lawes and Love, Both leagu'd, both vow'd Baptized to approve The Christian Eunuches Faith by Philip taught, And long before to Ethiopia brought. Above Three Hundred Yeares the Gospels Spring Had cheer'd their parched Zone, and every thing Began to grow with various faire Encrease Of Ghostly Gifts and Homilies of Peace By their Abunaes Care, and Clergies Toyle, Onely the Great Ones still did them embroyle With Carnall Snares to crosse their good Attempts. Like as the Romaine Cæsars Saints intents By Tyranny had interrupted long, Till Constantine redrest the Churches wrong. So likewise Saints among the Abissines Were trod upon, or by sore Mulcts and Fines, Opprest, that some kept close, some fled away, Some as it were in hugger mugger lay: Others for feare recanted from the Light, Dissembling what they knew to be the Right, As many here gloz'd in Queene Maries dayes, And some in France with our Reformed wayes; Untill their Foes were calm'd, and Liberty Of Conscience sign'd to the New Christian Fry; About which time Hells Rage became allay'd, Which for Three Hundred Yeares the Saints oreswayd. But now on the Approach of this Fifth Age, By his Grave Counsaile and Abunaes sage. The Emperour of Ethiopiaes Land The Gospel more began to understand, And rais'd the Christian Faith with Publike vowes, Yet mixt with Iewish Rites and Levites showes, And though their Formes appeare extravagant, In Substance yet their Faith is Protestant, And little diff'ring from the Primitive Which we professe. Like Ours their Clergy Wive; They Minister the Cup unto the Lay; They honour Saints with a Memoriall way, But worship not Shrines, nor Imagery, Lest they might fall to flat Idolatry. Sound Christians, were it not that they too much On Moses Lawes the Observation touch: Or else that they for their Dispense do plead, That to eate Bacon, Hares-flesh, or the like, Might make them Leprous, and their Bodies sicke, Their Climates Sunne diseasing Bloud and Braine: That what agrees with us procures them Paine. Perhaps they ranke their Circumcisions use, And shrowd it with Indiff'rent things excuse. Devout they are, when in the Church they meet, They spit not there, nor come with durty feet. Their Lent is long, which by their Foes observ'd, They oft surprize th? through their Feasts halfe starv'd. Some Ancient Bookes among us lost they hold, Which they esteeme as Gemmes, more deare then Gold, The Oracles of Enoch, and the Booke Of the Apostles Canons they o're-looke, And the lost Acts of one of Calcedons Old Councells they retaine like Precious Stones. The Patriarch still of Alexandriaes Bay Claymes from Saint Marke their Sacerdotall Sway. These Negroes here for Christians I assigne, To shew that Christ his Church doth elsewhere shine, And that she might grow strong within the South, When in our West she seem'd a Dwarfe in growth. Out of the Christian Church exil'd by Romes Fierce Cæsars for the Faith some left their Homes, And fled for shelter to Remoter Climes, In hope to shun the malice of the Times; To shun the ten great Persecutions Rage, Many were forc't their Fortunes to ingage, Some past the Bosphors Straights, som Gibraltars, Others retir'd themselves where Sunne-burnt Carres, Twice yearely touch on both the Hemisperee, That they might live secur'd from worldly Feares. The like, whilst that mad Dioclesian rav'd, Our Brittaines did, and Neighbours succour crav'd, Who giving them Corporeall Nourishments, Were by their Guests with Soule-Food recompenc'd. A Saint-like Bounty, where both Parties Blest Partake of Love, the Greatest with the Least.) Among these Nations, now my Muse invites The Reader to review some Neighbour Lights. That Humid Westerne Ile, whose Soile resists Snakes, Toads, and Moules, whose Wood no Cob-web twists, Stor'd with true Saints a Saint-like Stile now gaines, Trampling Pelagians downe by Patricks Paines. For while they skream'd in Brittain, France, &amp; Rome, He Preacht free Grace to reeling Christendome; He Preacht sweet Peace, dehorting men from Jarres, From Crying Sinnes, from Murther, Spoiles &amp; Warres; Though some of late in Printed Legends tell, That by his Word he Thousands packt to Hell. (A strange Narration, that a Saint should act So opposite to Christ a Bloudy Fact.) But after his Decease, Hybernia lost Within few Yeares the Style which grac'd her most: And then mad Broils her Members prickt like Goads, Worse than the Stings or Bane of Snakes and Toads. Yea, God with Wolves plagu'd her Back-sliding Fry, Because they like Samarians went awry: In mingling with Gods Worship, Idoll sights, Traditions Flawes, and Superstitious Rites. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE SIXTH AGE, Chiefly what hapned in the Ile of Brittaine after the Arrivall of the Saxons from the Yeare of our Lord 500. untill the Yeare 600. being the Sixteenth Yeare of the Raign of Maurice the Romaine Emperour. The Argument. The Christian Church, which Greeks &amp; Latins rear'd, In Brittaine lyes with Pagan Rites besmear'd, Trod on by Saxons Troupes, and Wodens Brood, But worse by her Owne Natives sheading Blood. Five Hundred Yeares from Christ not fully told, When Arrians stopt, then stept Pelagians bold With more sly Tricks of Humane Worth to boast Then that Dull Sect, which wrongd the Holy Ghost. Wherefore New Broiles infested Christendome, To chastise men for Schisme, as to make Roome For Antichrist the Head of Heretickes, Which Mystick wise from Mungrell Catholickes Deriv'd his Birth, and will a Tyrant grow. Because Men loved Lies, such Plagues did flow. Great Plagues indeed; which since defil'd the East With Carnall Baites by an Arabian drest, And with Soule-tainting Charmes by Popes profest, Cookt by Pelagians first within the West, Confounding Faith by Whimseyes of the Braine With Flesh and Blouds Desires, and Merits staine, So that Our Ile her Former Glory lost; There was no Roome left for the Holy Ghost, Pelagius had her Motions so engrost And then her North to Humler all was lost By Scots and Picts usurpt with dismall woes. Because she Grace blasphem'd, God sent her Foes, Which like a Deluge broke through Adrians Wall, Till Strangers came with Armes to end the Brawle. Yet ended not her stinke of Ghostly sinne, Nor Carnall Snares, where she involv'd had beene. The Sunne had run One Hundrid Yeares at full, Ere Heathnish hands could all her Feathers pull, Or part asunder her Old Seamelesse Weare, Which Christ his Font had dipt with Reverend Feare, In Dies sent her from Eleuthere in graine, And by Great Helens Sonne Confirm'd againe; Plaine without staine, I meane, and free from Pride, Or that foule Schisme, which did her since betide By her Abortive Brood, Pelagian Crew, The Sect that made Millions of Soules to rue. Plaine Robes she wore without Embroidery, Or Worldlings Garbe, when Antient Hillary Greeted his Brethren here in Brittany, Those whom Faith linkt to Saints sweet Company. So well had Damian and Fugatius bore Christs Ensigne here two hundred yeares before, That at the Councell Grace Theodoret Rejoyc'd to see our Brittish Elders met. With Purest Flowres Our Brittain Church did bloom, Till in Honorius Raigne, Gothes ransackt Rome. She flourish'd under Romaine Legions long, But those being gone, she faded and went wrong; And then Fiends watcht the Time while Heresie Possest weake Albions Braine with Lunacie. They saw how she cosseted her Child Pelagius, now she was by him beguil'd, They loath to lose advantage, nurst the Hate Betwixt her and her Aydes. Although of late The Remnant which the Romaine Cæsars left Of Souldiers here to guard this Ile from Theft, Were with the ablest Brittish Youth to France, Transported there to lead a Warre-like Dance Against Romes Foes, where by Warres-casualties Few liv'd to see their Home-Calamities: Yet Brittaines rather here for Empire fought Then to gaine Soules for their Redeemer sought, Or rather Romaine Fry in Brittaine borne, Their Factions made Our Brittish Church a scorne: Their Church, which late with Twenty eight did towre Since counted sev'n, and ebb'd to Bishops foure. Their Temples and Romes Legionary Townes, Were quarter'd out for Teutons Garrisons; Before the Sunne had Forty yeeres his Race Run through, since Hengist rais'd Old Wodens Mace, Those Germains then did them, like Wolves, devoure, Since Home and Forraigne Saints did faile to scoure Their Vessels cleane from Filth, since both did faile Saint German and Saint Lupus to prevaile. After these Starres declin'd to Natures Course, For Thirty Yeares the Church oft fared worse, Some times aloft she mounted; other times She stood amaz'd at Change of Worldly Climes; Peace setled her in a Calme Aire againe, When Dubrice did Pelagian Blasts restraine, About the time of Great Justinians Raigne, And then a while Our Church renew'd againe, When after home bred Jarres and Civill strife, Our Petty Kings chose Valiant Arthur Chiefe Over their Troupes in Brittaines Westerne Lands Against fierce Wodens Race, and Saxon Bands, But soone relaps'd the Brittaines, proud of spoiles, Not caring for Devotion, all for Broiles. They one another strove more to supplant For Elbow-roome, then Christian Faith to plant. Such impious Blurres observ'd by Hellish Fiends, They sow'd Debate betwixt them and their Friends, Made them so slight their Patriarchs grave advise, That in dispaire he from Carleon flies; Whence cause he brookt not the Silures Crimes, Demetia a beg'd his Crozier, Hapre, and Chimes. But why didst thou, Saint David, fly from Usk, To smell of Herrings, when thou mightst have Musk And Frankincense to offer unto God, Neerer then where thou fixest thy Abode? Amidst the Craggy Hills and Foaming Floud, So farre remote to doe the Saxons good? Why mightst not thou beat downe Idolatries, As thou didst daunt Pelagian Mysteries? Which by Free-will had strove Gods Grace to rend, And on Mans owne Poore Merits to depend? Feare caus'd thy Flight, or else thy Clergies Hate Brookt not the Glory of a Rising State; Or Discontent to finde the want of Love, Among thy Flocke procured thy Remove. Meane while behold thy Country-men at ods, Struggling for brittle Sway, like Demy-Gods. At the Decease of that brave Martiall Prince, Whose Tombe was found in Glastenbury since, All went to wracke, like Alexanders State, They parted that which he had gain'd of late, And by their Strife with fell intestine Rage The Victours lost the Saxons Vassalage. While they obey'd One Soveraigne Generall, Nor Scots nor Picts could work their finall Fall. Their Foe-men paid them Tribute, and the East Of Wodens Brood cring'd to the Brittaines West. But Sussex now out-braves proud Constantine, While Vortipore South Cambria makes to whine. Looke how the Nymphes of Dee and Severne grone To beare the yoak of Conan and Malgon; How Mone and Man with the Lancastrian Lasse Cry out: Alasse, that they serve Cunoglasse, Who, though the Greatest of the Brittaine Kings, Shames Christians more then Humbers Pagan stings. These leagu'd with Arthur late for States Defence Against their Foes, now for Preheminence Contend, and kill their Kinne, like Sheep or Beeves, And, which to blaze as yet my Nation grieves, More prone to smother Truth with glozing Cardes Then heare their Twuysogs Fall by honest Bardh's: Two harmelesse Youths of Arthurs Princely Ligne Were slaine in Wintons Church by Constantine, That Cornish Wolfe, who had usurpt their Right, He slew them there in their owne Mothers sight, Without regard unto that Sacred Place, To Christ his Altar, or their Noble Race. And as their Kings, so did their Iudges rave, Sheading Inferiours Bloud, whom Christ forgave. They sit on Theeves, themselves the greatest Theeves, Defloure the Daughter, whilst the Father grieves. Their Plighted Mates they murther or divorce, And spare not Altars to profane with Force. The Bruit of these Misdeeds inhumane strikes Such Odiousnesse, such Horrour, and Dislikes, That their owne Bloud, whom Brinish Seas divide, Gaules Britonants, disdaine with them to side; And their Old Friends of Patricks Iland scorne To ayde a wicked State through Discord torne; Nay worse, instead of aide Gurmundus came From thence for Spoiles, and soone them overcame, The Brittaines thus forlorne, Northumbria gaines, Mercia starts up, and the West-Saxon Raignes, Which Last will last, and shall chalk out the way In times to come for a Monarchique Sway. No wonder that rude Strangers gained roome, And banishd them from their best Native Home, Sith neither Dubrice, David, nor such Starres Could them reforme, God sent them bloudy Jarres; Not all at once, but by Degrees he sent His whips of Wrath whereby some might repent; But all in vaine. No Threats could Brittaines tame, They did those Sinnes which Painims blush to name. Hengist at first did but East Brittaine claim, And Thirty Lustres past ere Angles Prease Durst Severne passe, and longer Yeares then those, Ere Offa could his Marches Meeres enclose: During which Terme had Brittaines trud the Path Of Penitence, they might have calm'd Gods Wrath, Exchang'd with Foes the Chain of Thraldomes yoak, And scap'd what since they felt, Bellonaes stroake. So sung a Swan of Claudius Cæsars Towne, Whose Birth fell out that Yeare, when Brittaines won The Day with Trophees at the Barbon Hill, And did their Trench with Saxon Coarses filt. He not a Rush did for lewd Tyrants passe, But against Five stood like a Wall of Brasse. He shew'd what heavy Plagues would them befall, How they and none but they caus'd Brittaines Fall; Their Incests, Thefts, and their loud Crying Sinnes, Which to commit they car'd no more then Pinnes, With Tragick Buskin and Propheticke straine, He fear'd not of their Treasons to complaine, Who though but weake against the Common Foe, Divided Kings, at home yet raged so With Bloudy spoyles, that through their Tyranny, They lost the most Part of West Brittany, For all, which they possest from Winchester To Cornewall, Pagans got with Glocester. Now Sussex, and the Mercian Kings arise On Severnes shoare to plant Dutch Colonies. Such Threnes of thine, Good Gildas, proved true, As Christians felt by that which did ensue. Their Champions then to Woods &amp; Mountains fled, Where Savage bent, and with such Rancour led For the long Knives Complot, which like a Torch From time to time did their gall'd Entrailes scorch, Their Clergy at no hand would joyne to Preach The Gospel, nor the Saxon Rout to teach, Unlesse they would to them againe restore Their Country back, which they had snatch'd before: Untill at length Romes blessed Gregory Dispatcht a Monke of Famous Memory To Englands Kent, where soone he did convert Prepar'd by his Faire Queene King Ethelbert. Whence thousands moe with all their Kings became By Austines paines Baptiz'd, to Brittaines shame. For which neglect of theirs, and Neighbours scorne, Their State all rent, and through Dissention torne, Northumbers since did to West-Chester rush, Slay Bangors Monkes, and Brocmaels Forces crush So deadly, that thenceforth they seldome dar'd To try the Fields Event with Foes prepar'd. And this sore Blow in Judgement them befell, As Gildas first, and Austine did foretell. Thus stood the case with Brittains Commonwealth, Because they gave themselves to Rapines, Stealth, To Fraud, Revenge, and chiefly to contemne Those, wh? they might have made good Christian men Without the helpe of more Competitours, Brought from proud Rome to build up Babels Towres, For Austine, when he came, began to strive With them for Rule, and Romes Prerogative, Which compli'd not with Saints of Christian sort, As an old Hermite guess'd by Austines Port, Who Pope-like set disdain'd to rise and greet Sev'n Christian Bishops with Love-congies meet. Such harsh Salutes, or Inhumanity, So farre remote from sage Urbanity, What could they but distracted Rents produce? Ending in Schisme, and Holy things abuse? Our Saviour Christ was meek, all made of Love: The Devill proud, and so his servants prove. O what adoe they kept? what Coile? what sturres? With Synods Pleas, with Quillets, and Demurres? Like Turkes for Turbants, Monkes for Frizes Hew, So Christians then did one another sue. The Easters Time procur'd this Factious Brawle, The Romish Claim'd from Peter and from Paul, The Brittish by Prescription from Saint Iohn, And their Feasts Date the Greek Church grounded on. But nothing could appease the Adverse side, Till Force at last the Quarrell did decide, Untill Saint Colman and the Scottish Clerkes For Unions sake were faine to yeeld to Quirkes, Pope Fœlix now sign'd the Last Unctions use, Which did in time a Sacrament produce, That by more Fees Priests might enrich themselves For sacring Oiled Feet from aiery Elves. One thing of Note must not forgotten be, How in the Yeare Five Hundred Fifty Three. Then at a Councell in Bizantium held The Romaine Pope Vigilius was refell'd For Heresie, Judg'd Excommunicate, And doom'd to be deprived of his State. For which and murthers prov'd the Emperour, With slender diet starv'd him in a Tower, A just reward for claiming all that Scope Of Liberties due to the Westerne Pope, Which Nicens Councell under Constantine, Did long before betwixt Five Popes assigne, Betwixt them of both Romes, of Salems Flocke, Of Antioch, and of Alexandriaes stocke, So that our Popes in the West Franchise watcht The Soules, which Peters Net for Christ then catcht, Not with Hells Husks, Traditions, Dreames, and hies, But them to feed with Scriptures Homilies. So wily was the Serpent to begin With our Prime men and Starres, to plunge them in The Gulfe of Worldly Pride and Avarice, That by their meanes they Others might entice, For when the Head feeles Pestilentiall Flame; How soone puts it the Members out of frame? If, like Saint Peter, He that claimes his Place, Had liv'd, Romes Church had stood in better Case. But how should then the Prophesies of Paul, And of Saint Iohn beene verifi'd at all? In vaine the Man of sinne, Perditions Sonne, Long time by Cæsars Pompe barr'd in that Throne To sit as God, and in Gods Temple too, The use of Meates and Marriage to undoe; To wrong the Church by Carnall Sacrifice, Of Soules and Bodies making Marchandise; In vaine Great Babels Whore the Scripture hath Describ'd, if Rome had kept her Former Faith: By thrall'd Vigilius mark, that Popes were then, Ev'n for Six Hundred Yeares to Mighty Men, Eaths Lords, enthrall'd aswell for Life as State; Yea, Christ our Head to Cæsar paid a Rate Both for himselfe and Peter from a Fish Without excuse, Grudge, or repining Pish, As they did since, which challenge Peters Chaire, Under pretext Romes ruines to repaire. And herewithall let all true Christians know: “As long as men are kept in aw and Low, “At some High Powers beck, whom they doe feare, “So long they vertuous are, or so appeare. This of the Popes may well be verified, “While they were by the Cæsars terrified, “And subject to the Lawes, so long they thriv'd “In Goodnesse, Pteacht the Crosse, in order liv'd. But when they once obtain'd the Primacie Above their Peeres, and the Supremacie Above the Cæsars, then they wantoniz'd, Grew Avaricious, Proud, and ill adviz'd. But this great Flame will not breake throughly out, Untill th' Eleventh Age shall wheele about, When with False Christs, like Capernaites Chymeres, The Dragon more will charme Great Babels eares. Thinke on these Sparks, yee States and People all, From the Kings Bench to the poore Coblers Awle. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE SEVENTH AGE, From the Yeare of our Lord 600. untill the Yeare 700. in which Tract of Time the Romaine Pope got the Style of the Universall Bishop, and Mahomets Sect began. The Argument. What Heresies sprang up ere Antichrist Broke from his Swathes into the Church of Christ. He growes. but not to full maturity, Till he hath got the Two-fold Soveraignty. Next to Gods Word, or Oracles Divine, Contemplating on Matyriz'd Iustine, Tertullian, Irene, Tatian, Clementine, Lactantius, Euphreme, Ierome, Origen, Eusebius, Leo, Cyrill, Nazianzen, On Epiphanius, Basil, Hillary, Theodoret, Ruffinus, Gregory, And their more Ancients Cyprian, Chrysostome, With those of Aff'rick, Asia, Greece or Rome, Whither they in th' Abissines Libraries, Or Vaticans immur'd for Antiquaries; Whether in Print, or Manuscripts they be, Musing, I say, on them with insight free, Who wrote within the First Six Hundred Yeare, Besides the Synods of the Sacred Peeres, Chiefly at Nice (to sort New-things with Old) I wish this Post serit set in stamps of Gold: Those Wits, who can Grave Epiphanius scan, May helpe to fan Romes Church from the Old Man, Like Wheat from Chaffe, or Gold from dust and drosse. I wish this done, but dare not it ingrosse, Or undertake my wishing to fulfill Or want of time, of Strength, of Levites skill. Though while proud Cæsars rav'd, some Christians pain'd, Yet Pliny shewes their state when Trajan raign'd; Nor could their Rage, nor Victors thundring schisme, For Easters Rites impeach Faiths Catechisme. Curst were those Weeds sprung of Idolatries, Which by Truths Flame Good Epiphanius tries: And Blest the Flowres, or Herballs of the Fields, For Quintessence which Epiphanius yeelds. There, Millenaires, and grosse Monothelites, With other Clouds dim the First Churches Lights. There, see wise men then Fire Drakes more unsure, Yet others there more sure then Cynosure, Though Origen and Cyprian in some things Have err'd, yet Saints by Union Calm'd their stings. While Arrians Rage Chiefe Rulers of the Rost, The Orthodox proclaime the Holy Ghost. While Capernaites Christs Flesh most grossely take, True Saints by Faith that Mystick Food partake. Where Ebionites and Manichees taxe Marriage, There, Gods Elect dissolves so strict a Carriage. Where Montanists for Merit Fasts erect At Times prefixt, there, Saints a snake suspect. Priscillians teach men to Equivocate, But Christian Saints all Double-dealing hate. Caianes Sect did Angels Help implore, And with fond Vowes their mystick Shapes adore: As likewise did those doating Heretickes, Whom some in Austines Time term'd Angellicks. But Saints Christs Father serve, that Mighty One In Persons Three, and three in One alone, Not Creatures, nor the Members, but the Head Of Creatures Life, the Iudge of Quick and Dead. All others Help they utterly disclaime, Save that, which they through Christ his Merits claime. Some to Our Lady offer'd Sacrifice, But Epiphane blames them of Heath'nish vice, Suites Womens Cakes for her Idolatriz'd With Trash, which to Heav'ns Queen were sacrific'd, Equalls their Deed to that which snared Eve, Yea, to the Serpents which did Eve deceave, And likewise teares the Vaile where Christ was painted Forbidding Dead Mens Pictures to be Sainted; Wherewith by Letter he upon this Theame, Acquaints the Bishop of Ierusalem, Advising him not to endure the like Scandall, or Crime within his Bishopricke. This of the Veile at Anablata hung Was then from Greek turn'd to the Latin Tongue. Novatus damn'd men after Baptismes Breach, But no Despairing Fate Mild Christians teach; They rather will raise up the Bruized Reed, Then Thunder out what is not in their Creed. Such Lamps this Holy Worke of Ancient Date Exemplifies for us to imitate Such Damps likewise expressed in that Work May warne th' Elect, where doth the Dragon lurk. There, Heretickes in sundry Formes appeare, There, Christ his Church you may discerne most cleare, And how good Christians liv'd in Dayes of Yore, With what they taught before that Rome turn'd whore, Or which of Either Church are growne of late In Faith, or Manners more Adulterate, There, with some Paines we might gaine knowledge more, Which Worke I wish, but want the Lydian Lore To touch, to try the Spirits, and apply The Extracts to the Moderne Policy. Let some Grave Elder with Seraphick Love, Indifferent, Just, and Mild, the Spirits prove. Let Usher, Hall, or Learned Montague, My Mate sometimes in Eaton those renew, Which, if my Mindes presaging Augury Faile not, will yet to us more Newes discry; Or if Affaires afford them not the leasure, To levy, rate, and draw the hidden Treasure, Some Good Professour of Judicious Braine, Which wants a Flocke, may undergoe the straine; Or some brave Spirit of our Academes, Start up to blaze those sacred Theoremes, Which adding wings to our Reformed Flights, Would serve to guard our New-born Lambs from Kites And shew them Gentle Bathes, when to the Brim, Old Tiber fill'd cause Elephants to swim; While Honest Swains them greet: God blesse the weak, And grant they not their Christian vowes do breake, While Saints doe Saints salute: God speed the Plow, And make us all content with what we sow. So that their Seed be pure, full well we know, They with Increase and Peace shall reap and Mow. The Harvest great, no doubt but Christ enow Of Workemen will provide, though I be slow. I now review another Century: About the Sev'nth of Christ, the Mystery Of Ghostly Sinne began to domineere, And here-hence-out a Pilot false will steere The Churches Ship exalted by his Mace, Who durst usurpe his Lords Imperiall Place, Bereaving Him, his Wife, and Babes of Life, (An Omen sure portending future Strife) From Phocas first receiv'd Pope Boniface Investiture of his Supremest Place, And to be styl'd, The Churches Soveraigne Lord, Which some have wrested since to Peters Sword, Which smote off Malchus Eare. In the meane while Hypocrisie did all the World beguile, For from the Yeare since Boniface began, The Dragon wrought upon the Braine of Man, With more sly Trickes then in the Times before On Hereticks, or Wits of weaker Lore. Pope Gregory fore-saw this Mystick Cloud, And New Romes Patriarch therefore warn'd aloud: That who aspir'd to be the Soveraigne Priest, He was fore-runner of False Antichrist. This Gregory fore-told, although himselfe Had left his Ship on a suspected Shelfe; When here in England he gave Austine leave To winke at Heathen Feasts, to interweave Their Stuffe with Faith, which some resemblance had With Christian Formes, to weane them from their Bad And damned Garbes, that so by Easie steps They might ascend, and not by sodaine Leapes. These Pagan Rites by Saints conniv'd at first, Like tainted Vessels savour'd of the Worst, And long retain'd their mixt Religions Taint, Till the Last Age, on the New-mans Complaint, Had purifi'd what the Good Spirit knew Expedient in the Church Christ to renew. That Monster, which since the Apostles Age Crept Mysticke-wise, grew big, began to rage, And Raigne soone after Gregories Decease, Under the Keyes pretence disturbing Peace, And shall for Gold assume Iehovahes Might, To Thunder, Blesse, or Curse each Mortall wight; For now henceforth a Mixt Religion flowes, To marre Good Seed the Tempter Darnell sowes. With Dreggish Dreames, which here Pelagians first, And Monkish Braines had brew'd, they quench their Thirst. With Reliques, Shrines, and Lies, Monastick Cells Abound, and Darknesse now the Light expells. Foule Sodomy instead of Lawfull Flames, And now our West Blacke Superstition shames. As Mungrells of Samaria Sacrific'd Some unto God, some Creatures Idoliz'd: Some this besaint, that Image they observe, But really the Most Part Mauzzim serve. On Creatures they the God-heads Right conferre, And while they kneele to Shrines most grossely erre; The Sunne's Eclips'd, The Gospel they misprise, And slight the Crosse, the New-mans Sacrifice: The Fiery Crosse they flight, and hope by Deedes And Humane Craft to blot out all Mis-deedes. Both East and West, since Mahomet began, Since Mecha roar'd the Moorish Alcoran, Find much adoe their Credit to excuse, But must confesse the New-man they abuse, While the Old Man with his Voluptuous store, Traditions, and his Trident they adore; While Dust and Ashes they extoll too much, Gods Word concealing, where they inly grutch At Him, who did Poore Fishermen inspire With sundry Tongues appearing then, like Fire, Unlesse they will mad Iulians cause support, Restraining Light from all the Vulgar Sort, Who burnt the Scriptures, interdicted Zeale, And forbad Schooles to Christians Common-weale: As from the Yeare Six Hundred Sixty Sixe, Rome did obscure Gods Word to raise her Pixe. And what more Signe of a Tyrannick Sway Could be, then with One Tongue to oversway The Christian Church compos'd of many Sounds? The Catholick of unrestrained Bounds? Within this Age likewise the Agarens, By changing of their Names to Saracens, Intruded on the Right of Abrams Heire, On Christs as Moses Lawes, and on the Faire Possessions of the Church in Siriaes Land, With Ægypt, which to his Arabian strand Now Mahomet doth adde, that by those Three The Hornes in Daniel might accomplisht be, With Hodgepodge-Dreames Cookt for a Fairy Feast. And so himselfe of those Three Realmes possest Dar'd to spue out the most Presumptuous thing, The Alcoran, I meane, against our Christ, Whereby he grew One of Great Antichrist His Chiefest Limbs to Lord it in the East, As Popes already crept into the West; And save for Christian Name, which they doe beare, Shall over-match him in our Worldly spheare, For as the One himselfe styles Lord of Lords: So Ours shall goe beyond him by lowd Words, And Thundring Bulls accursing men to Hell, Dethroning Kings, and seating Soules aswell In Heaven, as in Purgatory-Cells: In which Attempts the Pope the Turk excells. But whether for Pelagian Heresie, Or for her Fraud Romes great Apostasie Fell out? (For though Pelagius she may blame, Yet his Conceptions with implicite Flame She hugges) Or when she turned Courtezan? Or when was Satan curb'd? I leave to scan, Loath to resolve such Questions Scrupulous, Till Fresher Gales, for their more cleere discusse, Shall quicken up my gravell'd Intellect From Ancient Scribes the Truth to recollect. I had almost forgot here downe to quote Among these Broiles one memorable Note, About the Yeare Six Hundred Sixty Foure, When Sarasens and Popes began to rore, A Female-Saint of Yorke did Prophetize, And speake against Romes New Enormities: She stood against the Shaving of the Crowne, Which then the Romish Church, to know her owne False Prophets by, as Publike Mark or Seale, Had forc'd on Priests with a lowd thundring Peale. Against the same, and Easters Romaine Date Good Hilda spake, but Popes said she did prate. For since they durst the New-mans Course exchange, Why might not they all Ancient Orders change? Adde to the Church New Sacraments, as Lights? And alter Times aswell as Outward Rites? He, that presumes above all Counsells, Kings, And States, will do farre more prodigious things. Thus Popes have done. Therefore I strongly fixe Upon the Yeare Six Hundred Sixty Sixe. When Gog with Force advanc'd the Alcoran, When Magogs wiles set up the Outward Man: Then did those Foes, though diff'ring in their wayes, Begin with Filth to soile the Churches Rayes. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE EIGHTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 700. untill the yeere 800. At which Time Irene raigned Empresse of Constantinople, being the Mother of Constantine and Nicephorus. About which Time Ecbert began his Monarchy in England. The Argument. The Churches Brood seduc'd with Monkish Lies And Mechaes Dreames, the Gospel they misprize; Mungrells themselves, then Mixt Religions flow, Yet some reclaim'd, their Mothers Voyce did know. About the Yeare Six Hundred Sixty Sixe, Strife dimm'd the use of the true Crucifixe. For Pictur'd Saints the Greek Imperiallists Began to taxe our Westerne Latinists, Whose Right or Wrong Serenus, Gregory, And Epiphane did long afore descry. Some priz'd those Types, like Bookes, to edifie: Some them defi'd, least Gulls them Deifie. Some thought their sight did quicken much the sence, Whilst others held they dull'd the Conscience. But to summe this: we must our Bodies yeeld As Mindes to serve the Lord, or lose the Field. We outwardly must to Gods Rites attend, As inwardly on his Good Gifts intend, For what the Heart adores, the Tongue sounds out, The Knee bowes to, the Sight puts out of doubt. Then, Agars seed prevail'd to Tyrannize, Popes to usurpe, and both to Sympathize With Satans Genius, by false masked zeale To over-sway Christs Church and Common-weale, Fraud taught them first to crouch and to dissemble, Then Fiends train'd th? to make their Foes to tr?ble. Thus darkned stood our Westerne Hemisphere, Till She that's with the Sun cloth'd did appeare. By Trumpets sound, and Printings Mystery, Recalling home her Strayes from Popery. Among which Lutes harmoniously Divine, Would I could thrust this Oaten Pipe of Mine. But was Our Church on Earth invisible Till Luthers Time? No sure. Most visible She lay to Saints, though to some Romish hid, Like Diamonds in Mines, yet clearly did She breath in Christ, although not eminent To Carnall Eyes, or on a Hill transparent, Yet Catholick, and through the World diffus'd, She sojourned with Holy Rayes infus'd, Like a Poore Pilgrim, one while in the East She liv'd retir'd. Another while the West, She put in mind of Jeremiaes Threnes: Anon the Northerne-Iles, and Isters Fennes She visued, and oftentimes the South, Or all at once she wakened from their Sloth, Which fruitfull Greece, and rich Arsaces Land Could testifie with Ethiopiaes Strand: Which Chams Tartaria and the Moguls Ground Could blaze how she Nestorians did confound. Which Snow, Moschoes Clime could justifie; Yea, many in our West could verifie, That she, Good Soule, with Teares and Doctrine sound Sought to redeeme them in Hells Fetters bound, And on Christs Merits onely to rely Without Distrust or Ambiguity, Tendring her Glosse Christs Gospel to expound, But most were deafe, or would not heare her Sound, For either in a Tongue unknowne, by roat, Or carnally they would her Dictates note. Nay, when she would indifferent things to use Permit her Babes, her Love they would abuse; And for her Care, her Champions they would raze Out of their Files with Curst Anathemaes. Yet some of better Mould attentively Gave eare; and these I praise deservedly. Some Godly Monkes, and the Old Saxon Bede Shew us what Life a Christian ought to lead. He dying wisht, at Cutbert wrote, that Men Would read Gods Word, and humane dreams contemn To which Good End himselfe in English Tone Christs Gospel left according to Saint Iohn. Those Holy Monks liv'd not on others sweat, Nor idly did by Strangers Tythes get Meat, But earn'd repast in Gardens by the Spade, Or in soule weather by some Houshold Trade. To keep their thoughts fr? sensual Plots they wrought, And on High Dayes or Festivals they taught Their Auditours what sence Christs Mystery Beares to imprint his Passions Memory; Or Catechis'd the weake and tender Braine With Scriptures Text, and intelligible straine, But when the Lumbards were by Charlemaine Represt, then Popes rais'd up their Peacocks Traine, With Carnall Sence and Carnall meanes support, Transforming Rites ingrosse stupendious sort, And by Degrees transferr'd to Catholickes Traditions hatcht by Former Heretickes. What Wheele is this? what strange Extravagance? Religious Rome, like Dina, gads to Daunce. Nay more, she paints her Face, like Jezabel, Darkning those Gifts, wherein she did excell, She that most Honour'd was next Salems Church, Spreads Lying Dreames, and now lives by the lurch. She, that was once the Westernes sacred Dame, Converting Heathen Soules unto the Lambe, Usurps Saint Peters Place with Lofty Style, Depraves Gods Gifts, and reares up Babels Pile. She, that was Chast, delights to play the Queane, And more then Good to practize Deeds obsceane, But these are Trifles in respect of those Great Sinnes, to which she will henceforth dispose Her Whoorish will, for wicked Sodomy She will commit, cheat men with Alchimy; She will proud Nembrod from Damnation free, And will besamt false Magus for a Fee. She will Create New Christs, burn Saints, force Hell, Mew up Gods Word, and Vertue quite expell. She Christendome will topsie-turvie turne, Dethrone her Kings, and make their Subjects mourne, But here the Comfort lyes: though Rome playes false, And Nero-like, debauch'd, yet all her Brawles, Plots, Menaces, and Tortures cannot stop The Pens of Some the Truth to underprop With Learned Workes, to blaze in every Age Her Breach of Faith, and tyrannizing Rage. Tho strong Conceit of the States Holinesse, Saint Peters Keyes, and Shrines did so possesse Remoter Braines, that Rome they did prefer Before all Climes. Thither Cadwallader Our Brittish King for Refuge in Distresse, And sundry Others went for Happinesse, As they then dream'd: Some for Mona stick Rest: Some to become there by such Merits Blest And if Ravennaes Feare, and Lumbards Sway Had not then blockt them in their Pilgrims way, With dangers by Banditi in some Straight About the Alpes, where Theeves for Preyes awaite, (Such was the Blindnesse of that Ages Zeale) Romes Mart had greater been, more lowd her Peale, As sithence for her Marchandize encrease Fell out, though to their Losse of Inward Peace. While Rome thus vaunted of Imagery, Greece seconded her Sinfull Mystery. And though New Rome long struggled with the Old, Yet now her Keyes then Ice become Cold: And so prevail'd damn'd Errour at the last, That Nicens second Councell made agast Our Christian Church, when that Romes glorious Head She saw Accurst, and yet themselves mis-led Would set forth Acts for Images Adore, Which their Greek Church condemned had before. Honorius was most justly Censured, But Idolls use they ill determined. For Heresie the Romaine Pope they quail'd, Yet Heresie within themselves prevail'd; And what the Former Age brookt as a Booke, An Image now like to a God they tooke, And held an Idoll in no lesse esteeme Then Pagans did to honour Dagon seeme, This Ages Griefe I point at, that the East We may conclude as faulty as the West. None can excuse themselves. Aswell New Rome, As did the Old, for Antichrist made roome. Because, like Rome, a Mungrell Faith they chose, The Greeks their Fame of Iconomaches lose. Yet this stole in but like an Ague Fit, They soone recover'd, and confounded it. They did not since so Superstitious grow, To vow that Service which to Christ they owe, They kneel'd not downe, nor crav'd deafe Idolls ayde, As if their Church to Baal they had betray'd. They minister the Cup unto the Lay; Their Clergy-men doe Marry to this day; And in the Mother-Tongue the Gospel read, Not like the Westernes Rome so much misled. And yet no doubt their Church went much astray In many points, though not so grosse a way, As Rome. They held, and made apparant Boast Of idle Quirkes about the Holy Ghost, That they might share, and be intangled in The Mystery of the Lewd Man of Sinne. For which Foule Crime, and Depravation, Christ Did then with-draw his Grace, and in that Mist, The Dragon did worke on their Enemies, As on their Wits, their Empire to surprize, And to prey on their Chiefe Metropolis, As Turkes still doe. And all for their amisse. Ere I conclude this Ages Century, I must not over-slip, how Zachary The Romaine Pope against Gods Word gave way From Childerick the Crowne to put away, And to Depose the French Mens Lawfull King On Pipins Plea, and for no other thing Then for a slothfull Life, and that a Bee Was fitter then a Drone to Over-see And Rule a Realme, that he tooke all the Care, While Childerick lay still in Pleasures Snare, Or lull'd a sleep, not caring but for Ease, Whereby he did the Common-wealth displease. On this surmize, the Pope gave his Assent, That the Poore King be to a Cloister sent And shorne a Monke, that Pipine weare the Crowne, The lawfull Heires from Native Right quite thrown. For this good Turne the Pope to gratifie, The Franks New King combin'd to fortifie Saint Peters Seat against the Lumbards strength, That he Ravenna forc'd to yeeld at length. The Yeare of Christ Seven Hundred Fifty Sixe, When men did much on Outward Objects fixe, Then Constantine to Pipine in the West Sent first the use of Organs from the East, In imitation of King Davids Harpe, A Godly Use, though Some thereat doe carpe, Which though Pope Paul the First did not abhorre, Yet afterwards he dar'd that Emperour With Curses for opposing Images: On these Popes doated so with Passages Of Glorious Shewes, that Adrian Peter all In Silver cloath'd, and Paul with Golden Pall. Thus by Degrees Rome that was fam'd for Chaste, Began to paint her Face, and proye unchaste. But though Popes daub'd, &amp; were more proud become, Others went Plaine like Old Religious Rome; And in Our West will so continue still, Till to adore False Christs, Fiends bane their Will. All were not Bad; although the Head was craz'd, The Lord yet some of Romes poore Members grac'd. No doubt, He blest some of the Romain Brood; Caiphas was Bad, but Nichodemus Good. When that Elias thought the Church downe reel'd, Sev'n Thousand were to Baal that never kneel'd. As in the East, so in the West there were Thousands which then from Idolls did forbeare, Fixing their onely Faith on Maries Seed, The Churches Head, which ransom'd Evaes Deed. Now the first use to Christen Bells began, Whereby (I thinke) they Baptisme did profane, When they deprav'd the Rites of Sacred Font, Wherewith to type the New-man we are wont. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE NINTH AGE, From the Yeare of our Lord 800. (About which Time Charles the Great of France after his Conquest of the Lumbards, was Crowned by Pope Leo the Third Emperour of the West) untill the Yeare 900. About which time the Danes sore afflicted England. The Argument. Charles builds New Schooles, subjects the Westerne Broiles, And with the Pope shares Faire Ravennaes Spoiles. Though some rare Wits renowned then that Age, Two Monstrous Deeds yet shame the Romaine Stage. Brave Charlemaine, like Romes bifronted Sire, Whom Pagans at the Former Yeares expire, And at the Newes Approah renew'd with Bayes: So merited this Prince redoubted Praise, For clozing up in the Last falling Age Our Westerne wounds made by Barbarian Rage. No Fate of Worldly Wheeles, nor length of Yeares Shall cancell Martells Deedes, nor the Twelve Peeres Dimme, nor expunge from Honours Calendar, For their Exploits and Memorable Warre Against the Moores, with whom they did so cope, That they quite lost their proud Ambitious Hope Of Conqu'ring France, as they subjected Spaine, But left behinde Two hundred Thousand slaine Of Moorish Coarses for a Pawne or Signe, That none shall France but Christians make to whine. Charles after Broiles in this Ninth Age began Three Academes to found for the New-man, To propagate in France and Italy, By whose faire Patterne Moe did fructifie In other Christian Lands, from whence Some rose, Some Rome to ayd, and some her to oppose: For though the Head of the Vertigo wheel'd, Some Members yet there were, which never reel'd. And surely Charles the Name of Great deserves Aswell as Constantine, but that he serves Too lavishly in my Conceit to prop Rome with more States, when she had need of stop. He Desiderius for her sake immur'd, And her with him to share the Spoiles endur'd. He did to her that Patrimony signe, Which since she falsely forg'd from Constantine; For which henceforth we must expect but Force, Spirituall Rapes, and the New-mans Divorce, Truth crying out, that they the Lumbards wrong'd, And that the Fee to Irens Sonne belong'd, Great Constantines Successour, New Romes Lord. But how should then proud Babel be ador'd? A lasse, that such Effects from Kings did streame, To taint the Springs of New Ierusalem, Since what they gave out of their Love and Zeale, Redounded to corrupt Christs Common-weale, The more Rome had, the more she coveted, (Ambition perkes with reines unlimited) And never will the Pope in quiet rest, Till he rides on a Scarlet colour'd Beast, Till he Crown'd with a Triple Diademe Shall both his Mates and Emperours contemne. But the Red Dragon yet workes covertly, He spues not all his Dregges but lets them ly At randome, whilst this Age amaz'd doth passe Like to a Dreame; and that the Next an Asse Shall turne, extinct of Light, and Learnings Fruit, Which Charles had left for Honours faire pursuit: Whereby more Roome shall for ambitious Rome Enlarged be for Soules abroad to roame. About the Yeare Eight Hundred Sixty Six, Romes Church being growne of late a Meretrix, Chast Marriage more to bring into Decay, And to promote the Antichristian Sway By Sodomes Snares and Brothelries accurst, Consented that Pope Nicholas the First, With Lucifers and all the Monks applause Should then enact these grosse Tyrannicque Lawes: That no Lay-men receive the Sacrament By Married Priests, though with devout intent; As if Gods Mysticks from John Baptists Sire, Or Peter savour'd of Profaner Fire; And that thenceforth no Priest should celebrate Within Precincts of all the Christian state Gods Service in the Vulgar Mother Tongue, But in the Latine, which did all belong, As he surmiz'd, to Peters Government, And so to him by reason consequent, Excepting onely the Sclavonian Rout And Polanders, whom he of Grace left out. Thus hath Romes Lord the Devils Doctrine broacht, And falsely on the New-mans Right encroacht. Where was Christs Church the while? gone from that Clime Elsewhere (perhaps a Thousand Yeares) to chime. That so Rome being for her unthankfulnesse Cut off, the Gospels Sound might Others blesse. But while this Eighth Centurian Age did last, Some Wits barr'd Sinne from spreading too too fast. Of these I praise good Bertrams Unity And Haymons Cares, because the verity Of our late Doubts about the Sacrament Of the Lords Feast they quote, and what is meant By that Divine and Mystick Ordinance, Which Carnall Clerkes by Transubstantiate Trance Broacht to confound our Weaklings Apprehension For his true Bodies Forme, Site, and Dimension: Ærigera then gloss'd the Sacrament Like them, from which our Moderne Popes dissent. So learned Raban did, and Isidore, Who held those Points, which Bertram held before. No Clarks then cloy'd Christs Flock with heavy Mast But drest his Feast fit for the New-mans tast: They Christ Receiv'd by Intellectuall Trance, And upwards taught by Faith Soules to advance. They taught their Flocke the Old Man to deface, And to embrace the Holy Spirits Grace: The Chaine 'twixt Christ and us incorporate, Christs Flesh and Bloud with Ours Regenerate: The Sacrament not taken in One kinde. (Who would bar Wine from Guests but men unkind) The Reall Forme whereof unspeakable If I describe, the Saints will say I babble, For Carnall Reason knowes not to define, How Christ descends at our Great Feast Divine. Upon our Faith the Holy Ghost alights, And He with Christ our rapt-up Soules unites, Makes us in Minde and Body Sympathize With Christ his Humane Nature Mystick-wise, But then before this Century expir'd, The Romish Church two Monstruous Meteours fir'd, And by their Dampe gave warning to those Times, That Vengeance was at hand, unlesse betimes They would New Babel shun with her false charmes, And damned Plots portencing after-harmes. The One fell out when the Whore Moguntine In a Mans habie plaid the false Divine, So blear'd the Romaines Eyes, that they for Pope Elected her, to shew how they did grope, And stumble in re-building Babels Walls, Which they should let, lest they become her Thralls. A reall Signe, that Rome then turned Whore With Carnall soil'd, with Ghostly Traffick more. The Other Prodigy Pope Sergius spred, When he the Corps of Pope Formosus dead Dig'd from his Grave, beheaded him with shame, And into Tybers Streame then flung the same. How well Romes Head deserves the Name by John Fore-told of Old: The Whore of Babylon? By these two Flaming Brands and Papall Jarres, Good Watch-men may dissever Fiends from Starres, And by the Fruit proud Antichrist discerne, If foggy Mists impeacht them not to learne. His Empires wound which long since Goths had made By Constantines Remove, had for his Trade Of Soules beene soone recur'd, yea, Antichrist Been sooner knowne: But God that Cloudy Mist Permitted by degrees the West to blinde, Which grew of wild degenerated kinde, Untill Romes Cup of Fornications full Were mounted to the height the World to gull, That so his Word fulfill'd, her fearefull Fall Amaze them more, who her a Queen install. While she deferres her Coronation Day, The Next farre duller Age prepares her way, To climbe above all Christian States and Kings, And to invert for Gold Gods sacred things. Marke, Reader, but with Feare; and Glory not In that Old Churches Fall, lest that thy Lot For thy proud Peacocks vaunt of thine Owne Worth, May hap, like her, from Grace to be cast forth. While thus the Popes their Monarchy contrive, Within the Yeare Eight Hundred Ninety Five: In imitation of brave Charlemaine, Who founded Schooles poore Students to maintaine, And likewise of the Saxon Sigebert, Who rear'd the like in Cambridge to convert Two Ages past rude Wits from Ignorance: King Alfred built for Schollers Maintenance An Academe, or Universitie At Oxford, which with Men of Pietie, Men skilfull in the Tongues and Arts he stor'd, Such as could well expound Gods Sacred Word, Whereof himselfe a present Patterne was, And might be stil'd true Vertues Looking-glasse; Ev'n as our Iames was Learnings Oracle, Styl'd Faiths Defender, Brittaines Miracle; For as the One clad Part of Davids Hymnes In Saxon Garbe, wrote Bookes, and Catechismes: So did Our King of Famous Memory New-clothe those Psalmes in Verse, and Popery Convince with sundry Bookes, and Babylon, For which Our Age inscribes him Salomon. In Turne of Time, as Faith did ebbe and flow, Or as the Moone eclips'd, or Winds did blow, Religion wav'd, sprung up another Fry, Which grounding Faith on vaine Imagery, And their owne Merits puffe, for Penance sake, Or with Great Rome to part Vaine-glories stake, Took up Good Alfreds Taske, to build more Roomes In the Oxonian Towne, upon whose Tombes Faire Violets and Roses sithence grew, Because they living strove Arts to renew. This moved Wainflet, Wickam, Chichesley, And Others with more Fabrickes to supply That Nursery; Some brought in Wood, some Clay, Some Stone, aswell the Clergy as the Lay. Hence as from Sinons Horse Minervaes Knights Came forth, well skill'd in Fences and in Fights. Hence as from Saplings shot up Goodly Trees, Hence as from Hives came up Industrious Bees, Whereof some did the Conscience edifie, The Common-wealth some Others beautifie. Hence Wickliffe rose, Bale, and laborious Foxe, Who holp to build Our Temple Orthodoxe, Though not in Zeale to match the Primitive, Yet by such Good Mens Cares through Grace wee thrive, By Martyrs Acts fetcht from Old Registers To stop the Mouthes of false Interpreters, As by those Wits nurst up with Food Divine On Oxfords Paps, which now in London shine, And likewise by a Thousand Other Starres, Whose Radiant Rayes excell the Sunny Carres, At whose rare Gifts and Voyce our Brittains wonder, When they strike Sinne, like to the Sonnes of Thunder. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE TENTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 900. untill the yeere 1000. At which Time raigned Emperour Otho the Third, whom the Almaines call the Worlde Wonder. About which Time King Etheldred Raigned in England. The Argument. The Dulnesse of this Age. The Pope Supreme In Rule unto the Latine Tongue binds them Who are his Thralles. Yot to the Truth some stand Most firme. Th' Electours now grace Teutons Land. O who can count the Churches dolefull Teares, Her Woes, Her Fits, and Manifolded Beares By Saracens, the Popes, and Heathnish Bands, Who forraged, and rackt all Christian Lands? No sooner had Victorious Charlemaine Parted with Popes the Scepter Soveraigne, Adding unto the Keyes a Diademe, But Rome grew proud of that brave State Supreme, Although as then it was a single Crowne, And not, as since, like Gerions, Triple growne; So seem'd to have her former wound heal'd up, Which Cæsars gave by their Remove; her Cup O're-flow'd, her Mace renew'd, which Gothes had rent. She frolicks now, forgets her Banishment; She hopes, that the like Blow shall never light Upon her Limbs, nor work her more despight. She stands secure, and builds up Babels Walls, And by New Kings, her Tributary Thralls, Whom she hath train'd with Fetches into serve Her Turne, and as their God, her to observe, She stores her Palace with the price of Bloud, With Sinnefull Spoiles vail'd with an Angels Hood. While thus she vaunts of Carnall Dignities, And slights the Serpent, which concealed lies, Religion goes to wrack: and few there be, Which will, or dare the Gospels Splendour see. Dumbe are her Priests, and muffled are the Flock; Both Honour Stocks more then the Living Rocke. Instead of Scriptures now, Traditions strange, The Divels Huskes, disperst. Lord! how those range! Which though but light at first in Wise mens Eyes, None fannes them, lest they might disgrace the Keyes Usurping Lord, who, whilst he grac'd those Toyes, Stopt Strangers murmure at the Latine Noise. O tyranny, worse than Our Norman Kings! Such was Great Henries Spleen, and such his stings Towards the Welsh or Brittish Nation bent, Because they had by their Troupes Ambushment Neere Snowdon Hills defeated in their Woods And Straights his Forces, in his angry Moods He meant, if hesped in a Victours way Old Cambers Tone quite to exile away, And force the Vanquisht from their Native Tongue To learne the English Tone. But of this wrong Consulting with an Hermite, when he heard How hard that Plot would prove, he seem'd afear'd: That though their Persons he might subjugate, Yet he could not that Tongue obliterate, Which was so Ancient, but it should endure Till Doomesday came, the Pure from the Impure To separate, and that this Sound among The Chiefe should vent Allelujaes Song. Much then hath Rome to answer for this wrong, And they have Cause to waile, who were so long Barr'd from Soules-Comfort in the Mother-Tongue By Rapsodies unknowne, or Parrats Song. Before this Ninth Centurian Age began, Although the Head turn'd giddy, the New-man Forsooke not to reclaime the Chiefest Parts Of the Church-Body from the Serpents Arts. In all the Course of the Church-Pilgrimage, From the Apostles Time untill this Age, I apprehend no Pleas in that long Tract Of Time, nor reall Motives to substract, (Some Schismaticques excepted, and some Few, Who seiz'd on Rights to their Creator due) From her Essentiall Worth, and Purity; But that Romes Church leagu'd in Integrity With Cyprian, Ambrose, Ierome, Augustine, For the Resolve of Mysteries Divine; And that with those, whom I have named last, We hold True Faith in spight of Babels Blast, The Faith, which they did Catholicke professe; Yea, and the very same untowardnesse Of Factious Spirits, which they scorn'd, we scorne, Hating to see our Masters Rayment torne. Did any Famous Writers from Christs Age? Or in Eight Hundred Yeares since Christ engage Their Auditors to credit those lewd Points, Which with lewd threats Trents Councel late appoints Did either Popes, or Councels then ordaine From Wedlock Bonds the Clergy to refraine? Did they compell their Flockes Gods Word to heare In a strange Tongue, as if they sencelesse were? Did they without their Troupe Communicate? Or let them without Wine participate The Holy Bread alone? with curst intent So maiming halfe our Christian Sacrament? Did they kneele downe to Images or Shrines? Or offer Bribing Gifts? Or pay them Fines? Did they believe the Pope dispenc'd with Oathes? Or could dispose of Realmes to Franks or Gothes? Did Popes within sev'n Hundred Yeares exempt States from their Kings, or Kings hold in contempt? Did they beleeve that Popes could Pardons sell? And ransome Soules from Purgings Flames of Hell? Or do the Greeks, the East, or Abissine Hold to this day, like Rome, their Rites Divine? But rather joyne with us in most of these. Holding her Sick of Schismaticqués Disease? Did they before the Councell Popes preferre? As though, like Other Men, they could not erre? No Romainist, although he loves the Pope, Unlesse he rackes too much, will prove I hope, That any Doctours broacht that Doctrine out Untill the Sunne the Ninth Age brought about; Or till indeed long after by degrees Popes thundring Spells forc'd Monarques on their knees Against Christs Rule, who never grudg'd to pay Cæsarean Toll, nor Pilate did gaine-say. And if they should by Romes Type patronize Those Errours, which the True Church doth despise, Let them looke backe upon the Word Divine, And see if there they can such Points define; Or if before, or after Constantine, Till this Tenth Age from Purenesse did decline, They apprehend that Saints did Sympathize With those grosse dreams, which now they dearly prize. Onely some Shrines in Austins Time began To be in some request, by their Old Man Devis'd to soile the New, but not, as since, That they might from Gods Adoration flinch, With an All Haile to the Triumphall Wood, To Martyrs Ashes, or Saint Benets Hood. Though in our West Some us'd thus to comply, The East remembred yet Saint Anthony, Who at his Lives last gaspe, Sinne to prevent, Requir'd his Friends, that not with Monument They would enclose his Corps, but secretly Conceale the same, lest men might foolishly It Idolize in Zeale to doe him grace, Which would redound at last to their disgrace. To Iohn the Twelfe now Cæsar Homage swore, And that the Mid-time of this Age did gore. Of all the Ages since the Word made Flesh First rose on Earth none for the Church had lesse Of Learnings Light then this Tenth Century, Dull'd through the Damps of Hells great Mystery. Full Fourescore yeares so Ignorance prevail'd, That Knowledge seem'd extinct, the Gospel fail'd. Who could repeat the Pater-Noster, Creed, And Ave Maries oft, though with small heed, Or gloss'd on Shrines, or mumbled Latine Masse, In Schooles he did for a good Graduate passe. But if he made Monastick Legends knowne, A Doctours Cap became his shaven Crowne. Whether this chanc'd by Romes deep Policie, That none might dive to her Supremacie, Which she had newly Crown'd, or that the Warres, Anxiety embroyling Soules with Cares Prevented Learnings Growth, we find small Signes In that tempestuous Time of Vertuous Lines, Or Monuments to move Posterity Not to accuse them of Impiety. Such was the Blindnesse of this darkned Age, That none scarce acted on the Muses Stage Parts to be seene of Gotams Auditours; So busie were Old Fooles in building Towres And strong Monastick Cells, where they found Peace, Or to defend their Reliques from the Prease Of Souldiers stormes, which from the North did fall, Norwegians, Danes, and Pirates robbing all. Onely some Foppish Tales they left behinde, Thereby to cheat, not edifie the Minde: What Miracles were wrought in such a Place, Which they conceiv'd their Monkish Haunt to grace, How Dunstan hookt, catcht Satan by the Nose, With many moe absurder Lyes then those; Like Oberons imagin'd Fairy Dance, Or Arthurs Knights, or the Twelve Peeres of France; How Patrick kill'd Five Hundred Yeares before Thousands of Irish Kernes by Charmed Lore; How David did a mighty Mountaine move, And by his Word the Massy Earth remove. With such Fond Tales they gull'd the Multitude, That 'tis no marvell we account them rude. Yet o're his Church the Spirit vigilant Neglected not their Dreames extravagant To interrupt, by raising up the Wit Of Ælfrick to reforme their raving Fit, Which worke perhaps not usefull for that Age, But for our Doubts we doe conceive them sage, I meane for Christ his Body in suspence With Some, which till this Age in Ghostly Sence, I dare be bold to say, Saints ever tooke, Not Carnall-wise, but by the New-mans Booke. This Reverend Clerk in ancient Saxon Style Describes what Blots the Sacrament defile, And proves the Sence and Manner of the Feast To suit with None, but with the Spirits Guest. From the tenth Chapter of the Corinths First He thus compares: The Israelites a thirst Dranke of Christs Rock with a Spirituall Tast, And on his Flesh, though Clouded, brake their Fast. As our New-man, or zealous Catechist Admires Christs Body in the Eucharist: So they prais'd God for Manna and Rock-water, Types of the Churches Twinnes, how he begat her. Out of the Forrest of this Century, Excepting, Rudenesse, Broiles, and Butchery, I apprehend no memorable Course To beautifie my Lines; But worse and worse All things decline. This onely I conclude Imperiall Otho to extinguish Fieud, And mortall Jarres for Chusing Emperours On Sev'n conferr'd the first Elective Pow'res, Eternizing the Period of this Sceane, Whose Former Acts we count Rude and obsceane. This Otho by Pope Gregories Assent Did to assure the Almaines Government, And to content the Rhines Count Palatine, Because he next of Charlemaine his Ligne Deserv'd that Honour, which his Race hath held, Till Force of late the Golden Bull expell'd. For this brave Act the Authour got the Praise, To be enstil'd the Wonder of those Dayes, As they, who do that Order violate, Shall be proclaim'd Usurpers of the State. For an Appendix to my Register, I must not over-passe Pope Sylvester, Who by Hell-Charmes, Spells, Negromantick Lies, And Magick Arts defam'd the Papall Keyes, Preparing roome by that Catastrophe To the Next Age tost with a Sinnefull Sea. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE ELEVENTH AGE, From the Yeare of our Lord 1000. untill the Yeare 1100. About which time Godfrey of Lorraine became King of Ierusalem, and Henry the First Raigned King of England. The Argument. Hells Highest sleights a Thousand Yeares restrain'd, Breake out, when Priests the Scarlet Hat had gain'd. The Clergy barr'd of Wives. The Masses Cake Turnes Flesh. The Holy Land now Christians take. Now to glance on the Churches Darken'd wane, Who can deny but Rome became profane? When Satan was let loose a Thousand Yeares After St. Iohns Prediction, as appeares Even till these Times with Curses, Fire, and Sword, And secret Slights to martyrize Gods Word? Both Sun and Moone stood then eclips'd of Light, And Starre-like Men from Grace declined quite. The Heav'ns were mov'd, Strange Meteors scar'd the East, But Earth-quakes most appall'd the troubled West. Mens Consciences o're-clouded were with Mists, When Satan rang'd from his Confined Lists, With leave to prey upon those Romanists, Who had forsooke Christs Word for Antichrists, In giving heed unto Erroneous Spirits, Cashiering Marriage, and their Saviours Merits: Yoaking their Flockes, not of Necessity, But to subvert true Christian Liberty, (I meane the Spirits Freedome, and Gods Word, Not that which Fooles do to the Flesh afford) By Pilgrimage to Saints, Idolatry, With wonders wrought by Fiends their Faith to try, By Lies and Dreames bred in Scholastick Braine For Belly-work, Ambitious Ends, or Gaine: With Carnall Sence advancing Superstitions, And spotting Faith with needlesse Mens Traditions. With such Flim-Flams, since Satan was let loose, And since Romes Clergy Christ his Rivall chose, Were there False Church possest; and to this day Some goe in those strange Labyrinths astray, Not willing to be won; nor to decide By Scriptures Light the Quarrells of their Side. About this Time the Cardinalls arose Unto their Sway, till then a Secret Close, For though the Name were knowne of Cardinalls, Yet were they rankt but Deacons, Principalls, Or Parsons of Romes Parishes to serve The severall Cures, not Prelates to conserve The Papacies Resplendent Majesty, As since they grew by Satans Subtilty. On each of these his Holinesse conferres A Scarlet Hat, to Higher Place preferres, And amplifies with Bishopricks their State, Whereby they might live eminent, from Hate And Envy safe, the better to support Their Princely Pompe, and his Magnifique Port. At their Install he so much scarlet shares To cloth their Mules, that by those Scarlet Wares Saints may divine where Babels Whore abides, Which on a Beast of scarlet Colour rides. These Men shut up within the Conclave close, And having by most Suffrages him chose, Who stands for Pope, they then his usuall weare Pluck off, and in their stead bring glorious Geare: A Scarlet suit, Red stockings, and Red shooes, On which, because he claimes that he can loose Or bind mens Sinnes, a Golden Crosse they place, That some might kisse the same whom he would grace A Girdle red then they about him clap With Buckles all of Gold, and a Red Cap Present to him with Band of Gold and Pearle, Wrought and engirt fit for a King or Earle. Thus trimm'd, they put him on a Scarlet Cloak; And to puffe up him more with Glories Smoak, Upon his Head the Triple Crowne they set With Carbuncles and Diamonds beset. At last they mount him, though a mortall Clod, And on an Altar Throne him, like a God, The Holy Place, where their Masse-God remaines: There none of them to kisse his Foot disdaines. His Chaplaines now turne Politick Divines, More prone to spoile then prop up Sions Vines. Thus every Age hath added Royalties, Since first the Pope affected Soveraignties In Ghostly things above his Ghostly Mates, To scandalize the Church. This animates The Turks and Moores to counterpoize his Crowne With the like Tares by their Arabian sowne. For when they saw Religion mixt with Theames Of Humane stampe, they forged idler Dreames, That by such Carnall Baites their Sect like those Of Christian Name, might with such Wordlings gloze As loved Pompe, and by their Muffty hope The like Soule-blisse as Christians from the Pope, Whereby both Sects make up the Antichrist, Turkes openly, Popes slily crossing Christ. The Former rav'd, and quickly were reveal'd, The Latter grew by stealth, so lay conceal'd In Mystick sort from Carnall Drowzie Braines, Because Gods Word was hid, none took the Paines, Or durst indeed proclaime with open Lippes The Pope Christs Foe, or by th' Apocalipse Depaint him out in Coulours, least that Hire, Which Saints reapt since, they should have felt by Fire. But who would once suspect within the Church A Grave Divine to live so by the lurch, As to deprave the Holy Spirits Gifts? And in a Saint-like shape with Satans shifts, Wherewith he tempted in the Desart Christ, To take the place of a Monarchique Priest? And by the Keyes pretence for Gold to sell Mens Soules? and to dispose of Realmes, aswell As to encroach upon the Churches Ark, That None should preach of Christ without his Mark? Not onely in the Westerne Empery, But o're the World he claimed Soveraignety; And not alone he clam'd this Massy Round, But Other Worlds, and the Abisse profound, To order there, like Heathens Rhadamant, Soules Torment due for Deedes extravagant. How on the Psalmists Clause have School-men gloss'd? Thou hast all things under his Feet dispos'd? As Cattell Living men, as Fish pain'd Soules, As Aiery Foule High Saints the Pope controules. Among the rest of Antichristian Blots, I may not overpasse Romes damned Plots About th' inhibiting of Nuptiall Rites Unto the Clergies Ranke by Romish Kites; That Divellish Doctrine of the Latter Dayes By Paul fore-warn'd now Babels Strumpet waighes In a false Ballance by Hells Oracle, Slighting the Type of Canaes Miracle; And, as from Christ by Revelations New Authentick firm'd, she doth the same renew, Although that Plea Three Hundred Yeares before, Had ordred been against the Romaine Whore By the Sixth Councell in Bizantium held, And by th' Apostles Canons there upheld: That Deacons, Priests, or Clergy-men might marry, And if they should from this Position vary, The Priest not with his Wife cohabiting, They censur'd him with Deprivations sting; And if he should his Wife repudiate, They then judg'd him for Excommunicate. But notwithstanding all the Councells Three At Gangren, Nice, and This, they would decree Suborn'd by peevish Monks to lay that Yoak, Which they in Younger Yeares could hardly brook. For quenching of this Sodomiticque Flame, We finde two Workes under Volusians Name, To prove the Weaknesse of that Canons worth, By Ausburgs Bishop Huld erick set forth. Pope Nicholas the Second of that Name By this and other Acts quite out of frame Set Romes weake Church. Ev'n he by Hildebrands Lewd Counsel scorcht the Church with burning Br?ds And coram nobis brought good Berengare, That Babels Masse might prove as Market Ware. About that Time Rome fram'd a God of Bread Turn'd into Flesh, like Him, whom she had read In Genesis Created of Red Earth, Unto which Wight she Motion gave and Birth. To this New God with supercilious Brow She strictly charg'd her Subjects all to bow. Her Courtiers, and the Multitude confus'd Obey'd the Charge, but Gods Elect refus'd. Good Men refus'd, and Berengarius sought With Monkes support and Prelates underwrought, To contradict the Transubstantiate Masse, Or not to leave it unreformed passe. But Factious Wits with Worldly Policie, Tooke that to clinch and pinch Romes Primacie. Yet this Good Soule, though since for feare of death Enforced to recant, consum'd his Breath With Reasons sound, and Arguments profound, Till Tyranny his Patience did confound, In opposition to their Sacrament, Which derogates from the Man Christs Ascent; And left behind what Hell can never blot, The Sence of that, which seemes to Some a knot. Nor wanted he Applauses in that Age Of Abbots, Monkes, and Prelates wise and sage; And Hildebert a Norman Bishop wrot His praise at large, which Time shall never rot. Tis strange to me how Faction then prevail'd, That they had not in Disputations quail'd, Ashamed of their Ghostly Mans relapse, Having been nurst upon the Churches Paps, As they suppos'd, and of the Spirit borne, Yet they the Sence did Intellectuall scorne Of that Blest Food, which Christ himselfe fed on Before his Death, and gave thereof Construction Spirituall plaine, as all the Fathers did, That Saints might finde with ease the Treasure hid. But what they spake by Oratories Trope Rome wrested since her Masse to underprop. Sometimes the Fathers by Synecdoche, By Metonymy, or Hyperbole Spake to advance the Sacred Mystery, Thereby to print in ravisht Memory Soules healthfull Cure 'gainst Passions Insurrection Typ'd by Our Saviours Crosse and Resurrection. Towards this Ages End Pope Hildebrand Attempted by maine Force and armed Hand, To wrest from Cæsars Gift the Papacies Elections Grant, and Paramounting Sway, Which Popes receiv'd from them untill that Day. At least they tooke their Confirmations Weale Not sure without the High Imperiall Seale, And so did other Bishops in his Land, Assume their Worldly States from Cæsars Hand, But now the Pope by Romes New Cardinalls More pow'refull growne into his Party calls Aswell the Lay, as Clergy-men to ayde Him in his Warres, which Cæsar sore dismay'd; For by his Bulls he gave his Realmes away, And blockt from him and his the Heavens way. Thus he that tooke himselfe to be the Head Of Christ his Flocke claim'd Rule unlimited Aboue all Kings, and Earthly Potentates, And by the Keyes would alter worldly States. The Emperour accurst, he sends a Crowne To Rodolfe with this Posie written downe: The Rock to Peter gave the Rule Supreme, And he to Rodolfe gives the Diademe. Upon this Warrant of his Ghostly Sire Against his Lord proud Rodolfe did conspire. The Members rav'd, and turn'd irregulare, As if they felt the Cramp or Riding Mare. Then, Thousands rag'd with Frenzies Calentures, Till Thousands let them Bloud, or tooke their Cures. This Quarrell made all Germany to quake; With Rodolfe Some, with Henry more partake. The Crosse and Eagle rear'd for Bloudy Signes, Yet Cæsar foil'd Saint Peters false Assignes; And Rodolfe in the last great Battell fought, Lost his Right Hand, which to him dying brought He shew'd it to the Bishops standing by, Lo, here the Guerdon of disloyalty, That Hand, quoth he, which did to Cæsar vow, I lost by your Advise. Behold it now. But notwithstanding all these cruell Broiles, Proud Hildebrand, late Gregoriz'd, embroiles Himselfe againe, will hazard Soule and Body, But he will prove the Emperour a Noddy, His Soveraigne Selfe comparing to the Sun, And Cæsars Person to his Vassall Moone. So long he play'd, till Cæsar sacked Rome, Doom'd him, and set another in his roome: As Others his Successours Herods Sword Drew out so oft crosse to their Masters Word, That now of late Popes odious in their place, Twice Burbon did and Alva Rome deface. About this time our Rufus to enlarge New Forrest, there to have a Chase more large, Pull'd many Churches downe. But while he plies The Game, into his Heart an Arrow flies. Ere I proceed to the Next Ages Stemme, I must reflect upon Ierusalem. Our Westernes now by Romes Croisadoes spurr'd Made a brave League; and like good Brethren stirrd With Christian Zeale, they having Antioch won To Salem went, and took that Famous Towne, Mauger the Forces of the Saracens, Erected there the Crosse for Christian Mens Encouragement then living in those dayes, Wherewith the sight they might, as Star-like Rayes, Behold a glimpse of some Pathetick Love Home-frozen there renew'd, of force to move Compunction in their hearts on Calvaries And Olivets survey, a Sacrifice Well pleasing unto Christ, while they with Teares Mus'd on his Griefes, his Bloudy sweat, and Feares, His Passion undergone for their Amisse, His Fathers Wrath for Sinne appeas'd, and Blisse Restor'd to them, and to the Penitent By his Deserts alone and Punishment, Who without help the Bloudy Wine-presse trod, And seal'd for us a New Contract with God. This Citty by victorious Godfrey gain'd, When all his Host would have him there constrain'd As King to weare a Golden Crowne: Shall I Most Sinnefull Man, quoth he, unworthily Yeeld to be Crown'd with Gold in that same Towne, Where Christ was forc'd to weare a Thorny Crowne? Farre be that Thought from me, weak Mortall Clod, To slight his Crosse, my Duty unto God. Such Carnall Pomp I utterly contemne: Pitch we our Thoughts on New Ierusalem, Where every Saint the Vassal as the King, Shall Crown'd with Blisse Alleluiaes sing. The New-mans Complaint in the Name of Our Saviour Christ for the Romaine Churches Apostasie and Adulterate Religion. Whilst in thy Name I vent this just Complaint, Beare with my Song, O Christ, my Soveraigne Saint. But thou, Romes Cause of Sinne, thou Dotards Clod, Pack hence, or humbly waigh the Word of God; I am Truths Light, yet None from roaming cease: I am the Prince of Peace, yet None loves Peace: I am the Hill, yet None climbes Sions Mount: I am the Spring, yet None drinks of my Font: I am the Shepheard, yet None heares my Call: I am Gods Priest, yet None heedes me at all. I am Sinnes Death, yet None from Sin will rise: I am Soules Health, yet None me gratifies. I am the Way, yet none will tract my Pace: I am Lifes Vine, yet none affoords me Place: I am Faiths Quintessence, yet none partakes me: I am Soules Manna, yet aright none takes me. I am Most true to Man, None true to me: I am Rais'd up, yet None my Forme will see: I am Mans Baile, yet None doth con me Thankes: I am Hells scourge, yet None hates Satans Prankes: I am the Golden Meane, None waighes my Center: I am Heavn's Doore, yet None the doore dares enter. I am Gods Word, yet None will heare his Word: I am their Iudge, yet None regards the sword: I am Heavens strength, yet None sticks to my Fame: I am Zeales-Mover, yet None heedes the Flame. I am the Starre of the New-Eastern Morne: I am the New-mans Head, yet None's new-borne. I am the Thundrer, yet None feares my stroake: I am Free-hearted, yet None beares my yoake. I am the Lambe, None will my Nature take: I am the Sunne, yet None Sinnes Cloudes forsake. I am Truths Rock, yet None will now believe me: I am Mens Hope, yet None will cease to grieve me; But in these Times with coulour of my Rock, The Dragons seed doth persecute my Flock, And all Romes Clergy now doe listen more Unto the Popes Decrees then to my Lore. No wonder with Hells Plague that Soules are stung, When such foule Mists rise from the Monsters Dung. O wretched Man! whom neither Christ his Path, Nor Gospel moves, nor yet his Threatning Wrath! [Nemo] Yet if the Romaine None thou backward spell, [Omen] I may to thee a Converts LUCK fore-tell, Thou soone shalt chase our Aiery Foes to Hell, If thou by Faith seekst in the Heavens to dwell, And by the Crosse the Old Man to expell. Here lyes our Task: think on it, and Farewell. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE TWELFTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 1100. untill the yeere 1200. At which Time King John raigned here in England, who to be absolved of the Popes Excommunications made himselfe Tributary to His Holinesse. The Argument. The Councell Lateran confirmes the Masse. The Canon Lawes for Romes maine Profit passe. The Pope mounts up on Cæsars humbled Back. Schoole-men now rise. And Salem goes to wrack. Those whom Rome styl'd the Berengarian Sect, Because her Masse they ventur'd to correct, Where censur'd at the Councell Lateran, As at Vercelli the like Act prophane Against them past that Politician Whore, For her Trades sake, in the last Age before. And here likewise such Labours went to Pot, As Joachim a Latian Abbot wrot, To prove: the Man of Sinne, the Antichrist, And Babels Whore jumpt with the Romaine Priest, O Valiant man! who for this Mystick Point On Truths behalfe adventur'd his best Joint! No better sorts the Churches Pilgrimage In this obscure Eclipse, and Carnall Age: Popes struggling still for Worldly Dignity With Emperours, and for Priority. Amidst these Broyles, although Eugenius storme, Yet Bernard dar'd his Popedome to enforme, How he in striving Both the Swords to hold, Might lose them Both for his encroachment bold. And sure if Popes had not on Princes play'd, Nor warr'd with Worldly States, but onely Pray'd, And sought the Health of Soules by Lenity, They might have raign'd in long Prosperity, And by their Doctrine linkt with Holy Life Drawn wrangling States from Faction, Bloud &amp; strife. Whereas for Peace they rather Quarrels spun, Not caring by what sleights they Places won. So that some call him Pope a Yeare or two. And that great Kings or Dukes doe kisse his shooe, Old Adrian wreakes not how he came to mount, Nor by what Meanes, so he his Peeres surmount. And yet this Fate with a repenting Breath This Pope perplext lamented at his Death, And said, that he, who got the Papacy By Murther, trac'd the Steps and Policie Of Romulus, who slue his Brother Rheme, Alone to weare Romes New-found Diademe. When that Eleven Hundred Yeares and Ten Had wheel'd from Christ his Birth, a Bishop then Of Florence preacht, that the Proud Man of Sinne, The Antichrist, who long conceal'd had been, Was surely come, and in Gods Temple sate, Pretending Right to sway the Christian State. The Mystick Let of Cæsars Glorious Traine, Which made him hide his head, and did restraine His haughty Thoughts and Plots unlimited, Was thrust away, and neere extinguished By the Popes Tumults, Threats, and Stratagemes, Subjecting Bodies, Soules, and Diademes. Priests Ghostly Charge into an Earthly chang'd: The Spirits Gifts Simoniously exchang'd: The Words Eclipse: Idolatries encrease And Sodomies: with want of Christian Peace: These Hellish Crimes, or Deedes irregulare, Demonstrate, who the Churches Foe-men are. When Pope Paschalis Second of that Name Had heard diuulg'd his Hierarchies shame, Most Politick to stop the Bruit at first Of such New Sparkes, by his Old wayes accurst, He sent his Briefes at Florence to appoint A Councell there to right things out of joint, As he surmiz'd, where Coram nobis brought The Bishop there was forc'd to be new taught, With Babels Glosse to palliate what he knew, The Cole-black for Snow white, the False for True, And so to leave the Pope in Peters Chaire Chaffring for Soules, till Saints disturbe the Faire. But in the midst of all these brandling Cares, Which rackt the Church, succeeded other Snares, Soules to subject unto the Vultures Clawes, Renewd with Glosse Voluminous of Lawes By Azoes, Gratians, and Accursius Paines, That so Mens Wits by such divertive Traines, In hope of Worldly Fees toild might not pry Into Sinnes deep concealed Mystery, But nimbly helpe to execute the Bulls And Briefes, wherewith his Thralls the Tyrant gulls, Emptying their store, sacking their Substance dry, That he might joy at Clients Misery. And though the One the Elder Sister were, The Younger yet and Canon Law did beare The primest Sway, and Kings durst not gainesay But must appeare at Rome on a set day. For when the Pope enthrall'd the Emperour, Romes Keyes then Cæsars Lawes did over-towre. To fortifie the Canons glozing Glosse, About that Time Our Schoole-men then arose, Quaint Wits, who spun Divinity anew, And by Distinctions would the Gospel mew. Such Knots and Wiles did Curious Wits compose, That they to Rome might all the World transpose, And so heale up, and cloze the grievous Scarres, Which she sustain'd deservedly for Jarres. And for her Breach of Faith at Christ his Spring Vow'd, that to him she 'gainst the World would cling. But in the next Ensuing Age shall rise Bald Friers Sects to help Baals Sacrifice. To temper, or to stint these Busie Braines, There shall start up Men of unwearied Paines, Who seeme to raise Devotion at a pinch: 'Mong which I ranke Poore Francis Sainted since, Who innocent in Life, by Poverty Would faine restore the Old Integrity, To imitate, as much as in him lay, The Ancient Monks, or the Essences way, Or rather Benets Rules; but afterward The Dragon brib'd his Mates to be his Guard; His Sect soone stray'd, and his Fraternity With Merits boast corrupted Purity, Pestring the Church and Christian Common-weale, With Dreames adverse unto the Founders Zeale. Out of their Dung did other Orders grow, Austere in Life, of Sanctimonious show, Pretending Holinesse in Outward Sight, But inwardly in Melancholick plight, Now spending Dayes and Nights neere in dispaire, Anon blowne up, like Bladders in the Aire, With Meritorious Wind, Pelagian Worth, And Humane Workes they set their Doctrine forth, They lash'd their Flesh to keep the Old man downe, And, like that Sect from craz'd Montanus flowne, They stupifi'd through Fasts their Brawny Sides In hope of Grace, and Worldly Fame besides. Meane while the Bloud of Christ they frustrate made, And by such blasted Buds Faiths Tree did fade. Yet by their Deedes, and seeming Sacrifice The Scarlet Whore thought to redeeme her vice; And that their Workes of Supererogation Suffis'd at least to win a Prorogation Of Vengeance due for her high Pamperd Pride, If not to purge what Christ had lest untri'd: Like those who bought, to ransome Iudas Sinne, Blouds Hire, a Field to bury Strangers in. O what a Rabble doth my Muse descry Of Croakers from the Dragons mouth to slye Within the space of the Next Ages Rowle! All bent the Praise of Babel to enrowle! The Dominicks, Carthusians, Augustines, The Carmelites, Capouchins, Iacobines, Besides the Order of the Ierome Crowd, To whom of late Castiles great Monarch vow'd His Marbled Palace of th' Escuriall Mount, Whose Structure cost him many Millions Count. These Orders, though of despicable Forme, In Beggers Rags, yet holp they to reforme Some things amisse at their first shooting up, Or else the Whores Abominations Cup Had quickly been by Kings descri'd and spilt; Her Flock had flinch'd, and soone espi'd her Guilt. But the Conceit of these Mens Sanctity, And manner of their Lives Austerity Gain'd them Repute of Wiss Propheticall, Whose Vowes would shrowd Sinnes ne'r so Capitall. Yea, though a man had both his Parents slaine, Romes Pardons and their Vowes salv'd all againe. This blindnesse lasted long, till Christ his Spouse Returned from the Desart Soules to rowze From Superstitious sleep, and Ignorance, To brighter Light, and a more Lively Trance. Like Ravens, Frogs, Scritchowles, and Dismall Fowle, Whose Auguries type Weather Faire or Foule, So did those Flying Spirits of that Age Seale up Dark Minds a Prey for Satans rage, And on th' Elect betoken Calmer Gales To blow, when tir'd with Old fanatique Tales, They should in Time to come Gods Spirit see, The Martyrs slaine reviv'd, from Sodome free. While Canonists, the School-men, and those Swarmes Of Lawyers rose, the Romaine Popes with Armes And Curses still, leaving the Lawes dispute To spurre their League, did Cæsars persecute. No Treaties, Wars, nor Spoiles the Popes could tame, Till One of them of Alexanders Name On Cæsars humbled backe got on his Mule, As Foot-stoole to a a Lord of mad Mis-rule, Detracting from Christs Power: Thou shalt tread On Basiliskes, and bruize the Serpents Head. I doe to Peter this, and not to thee, Said Cæsar: Both to Peter and to me, Repli'd the Mounted Priest; for Peters Throne On Earth I hold, and he and I are One. O where was then Romes Boast of Innocence? Of Catholick Consent, and Penitence? Their Actions shew what Spirit raignes in them, Who durst assume the Triple Diademe, And manage both the Swords with more disdaine Then Bajazeth complain'd of Tamberlaine. But had not Cæsars Sonne in Navall Fight By the Venetians been Captiv'd, such spite He could not have endur'd so patiently, Nor let such wrongs long unrevenged lye. Now for this Age to winde up Babels height, One Thousand, and one Hundred Eighty Eight, About that Yeare the Machiavellian Pope, To settle surer his Imperious Hope, And to confirme his proud Investiture, Found out a Plot his Rapines to assure, And to employ his Neighbours farre from Rome, Lest they more pry into his Arts at home, By his Croisadoes Charmes Cri'd Sanctifi'd In Christ his Name, but by his Word untri'd, He packt from hence many a Valiant Band, Under pretence to Conquer Iewries Land, And there to build Jerusalem againe, Like Iericho sometime not Curst in vaine, And to regaine it back from Saladine, Who late had won the Land of Palestine. But as no Good flowes from a Tainted Spring. So hence then Losse ensu'd no other thing. Cæsar Romes Curses thinking to compound, Took up the Crosse, and by the way was drown'd. Yet could not so the Fathers Death appease; The Popes his Sonnes by Curses barre from Peace. And to redeeme their Bloudy Spoiles with Deedes Of Merit, they spread Meritorious Seedes, As that Fond Age then dream'd, they prostitute To Moloch first, and then they institute The Orders of the Begging Friers, so To calme Gods Wrath, which kept such lowd adoe At Rich mens Doores, that Superstition more And more confirm'd Baals Power then before. About this Time my Learned Country-man Archdeacon Girald wrot, by whom I can Disprove out of his Bookes of Pilgrimage Which he set forth of Cambria in that Age, The Wonders of the Well of Winifride; Which Friers Braines in After-times discri'd, When the Fourth Henry raign'd, that then, ev'n then They coin'd those Tales to gull poore Simple men, To haunt their Cells, and impious Sacrifice Grac'd from the Pope with Novell Liberties, And Leave to build a Chappell or a Fane, As Men were wont for the like use profane; And as they did in this Fond Age erect Most Stately Shrines to Becket and his Sect. Because some Monkes Night Apparitions saw, Which Knaves or Fiends invented there to draw Concourse of Pilgrims, and Oblations store, They built such Shrines, and nois'd their Dreames the more. But Our New-man slights all such Miracles, As derogate from Scriptures Oracles, Not ignorant of the Old Serpents sleight, That he may seeme an Angel of the Light. Because Men loved Lies more then Gods Word, And tri'd them not by the Spirituall Sword, He suff'red Satan to pervert their Will, That they believ'd what did the Spirit kill. To let our Blinded Strayes to know their Crimes, Derived from the Course of faultring Times, I warne them to looke back into this Age, And there to waigh what Cunning mixt with Rage Popes practiz'd then by more of Councels store To raise their Crest then in the Times before, How many Councels did the Romish Clerks Assemble in our West for their vaine Quirkes Support? what Age before hath ever seene Of Councels held One Hundred and Fifteene? (For just so many did this Century Produce) Some to confirme Sinnes Mystery With Attributes of the Divinest Style: That as the Head conspired to enstyle A Wafer Cake a God, so they likewise, As Members would a God him solemnize With Power rais'd above the Cæsars farre, Since he could Soules from Purgatory barre. Some Councells leagu'd to send Croisadoes out To Palestine against the Persian Rout. Others were call'd the Married Priests to curbe; And some were held the Cæsars to disturbe, Exempting from their Lawes the Clergies Crew, Though nere so faulty, whence great scandalls grew. Some Councells did against all Kings contest Of Bishops their Investiture to wrest Unto the Popes. And some Pluralities, Of Popes restrain'd and their Enormities. And which seemes most uncharitable, foule, And Schismatick, some Councells did controule, Nay, put to silence the Reformed Flock, Who built their Faith upon the New-mans Rock, I meane, that Flock, which Lions Waldus won From Darknesse to look on the Gospels Sun. Such Acts above One Hundred Councells Tomes Contain'd to please the Popes, like Hecatombs, Within the space of the Twelfe Century; And all to prop Great Babels Empery. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE THIRTEENTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 1200. untill the yeere 1300. At which Time King Edward the First raigned here in England. The Argument. The Waldois and Albigians Rome oppose, Cæsars with Popes for Rule contesting lose, The Gransire, Sire, and Nephewes feele the Smart, Pope Celestine is gull'd by Wily Art. In wofull Case remain'd the Church of Christ, Through Bloudy Broiles, that how she could subsist On Earth, while this Age lasted, it might dull A Sparkling Muse, but that I learn'd at full The Cause of her Retire, the Difference Betwixt her Wane, and her Lights excellence, Her Catholick, and her Subordinate Communion, which false Rome would faine perswade That she alone doth owne without respect Unto her Mates, or Betters growne by Grace, Where none can see her Universall Face Save God himselfe. The World is large, our skill At stint: How then know we her Spatious Hill? The Waldois and th' Albigians in our West, The Abissines, and Others doe suggest, That they partake her Influence, and her Head, Ev'n Him that shall dispose of Quicke and Dead, Peter and Paul we know. But who are yee, Who Meere the Church of Nembrods proud degree? Pope Innocent in the last puddled Age By Canons strict, but neither wise nor sage, Our English Clergy now did here so gore, As Hildebrand and Lanfrank did before. That they without more Shifts, Delayes, Dispence, Or hopes to calme Romes Spleen through bribing p?ce Must turne away their Plighted Mates to grasse, Or be Accurst, and to refraine from Masse; A heavy Doome, and not to be recall'd. This made our Clergy winch, when they were gall'd, And causelesly thus curb'd without remorce Of that, which Christ condemned the Divorce. Against this Flash Walter de Mapes wrot Oxfords Archdeacon stout; he tax'd the Blot And Scandall which the Romaine Church encurr'd, He shew'd the Flames, which her poore Guard endur'd By such unlawfull Acts, those very Flames, Which Popes themselves not without branded Names Could well avoid in their more youthfull Yeares, Nor Cardinalls, nor any of their Peeres, They did enjoyne for tolerable Paine. This moved Mapes in Old Romaine Straine To gird and nip the Popes usurp'd Decree, And to prove Marriage for the Clergy free. But now my Muse more Bloudy Deedes must tell, Which then the Church endur'd from Fiends of Hell. About the Yeare Twelve Hundred Thirty One, The Greek and Latine Church could not attone Their Diff'rence new sprung up for Christian Rites, But a sore Schisme then chanc't, for Romish Kites Would rake ev'n to the bone all Churches else. They would yoake to Romes Soveraignty excelse The Easterne Church, and force investiture Of all their Bishops, and their Ghostly Cure Under the Keyes pretence to Romes proud Mace. But they would not subject, nor so abase Their Pastours Staffe, alleadging Old Decrees Of Synods made for ordring of their Fleece And Liberties in their prefixed Spheare, At Chalcedon, at Nice, and other where: That every Patriarch in their proper Charge, Should onely deale, and their owne Place discharge, Not medling with Anothers stinted Cure, But watching still their owne Flocks to secure, Not striving for high Seates of Prelacie, As Gregory then did for Primacie. To this Effect Bizantiums Patriarch wrot To Gregory the Ninth, that he could not Consent to thrall his Church unto his Will, Which, as a Tyrants Law, might spill or kill. At which Resolve Romes Lofty Prelate frown'd, And by his lowing Bulls accursed Sound Anathemated him and all the East, Because they would not bow to his behest, And therewithall proclaim'd the Crosse to fight, And to deprive them of Gods Blessings quite. According to his Will false Christians went, And Martyrs did with Cypriots Bloud augment. Before this Rupture both the East and West Till then agreed, on Union fixt their Rest, And though for Clericks Wives, and Masses Rites They varied, yet Romes Popes play'd not the Kites Till then on them, as in our Westerne Spheare, From whence they rak'd much Treasure every yeare; They Both agreed, acknowledging One Head, One Christ, One Faith, One Iudge of Quick and Dead, One Universall Church, One Bond of Love, And that One Spirit ought them all to move: All Patriarchs linkt in mutuall Amity, Coequalls grac't with Honours Parity. But through this Rent by Babels Whore begun, A Bloudy Flag was for Both Churches spun. This Schisme 'twixt East &amp; West obscur'd the Crosse And to them both fore-doom'd a two-fold Losse, Of Worldly States to Greece in time to come; But Losse of Ghostly Gifts to haughty Rome, Together with the Losse of Both the Swords, As Bernard to Eugenius well records; When she shall see how many Potentates Will flinch from her, and free themselves and States; When she shall heare One with a Dreadfull Tone Proclaime the Fall of Whorish Babylon. When Babel saw, that her Croisadoes mist Ierusalem to win againe for Christ, As she, but in Disguise, suggested then, Now she proclaimes them against Christian Men; The Waldois and Albigians feele her Spite, For against them she is resolv'd to fight. Some yeeld unto the Fiery Crosse. Some stay, Some stray, recant, and Others fly away With all their Kinne into Calabriaes Soile, Where till of late they liv'd safe from Romes Broile. Nor could that Age, nor yet the Ages since Extirpe their Seed, nor cause their Faith to flinch. Yee Darkned Ghosts of those inveagled Times, Who merit well Damnation for your Crimes, Doe what yee can, these New-sprung Waldois shall With their good Mates Albigians you appall, And shall out-last your Cursing Thunder-blasts Till Luther comes and gives you more distasts, At which appointed Time with lowder Crack Your Camerades shall tremble, or fall back From Balaams League unto a Nobler Head, Whose Spirit them will into Sion lead. Well neere 300. Yeares the Popes have fought With Emperours and Kings, their downefall sought, Depos'd the Sire, and rais'd a Rebell Sonne Unnaturall the Father to dethrone. They poyson'd some, and Others by degrees They forc'd to cry Peccavi on their knees; And all for worldly Rule. Nay, Kings durst not Curbe Homicides (such was the Clergies Lot) In those Dayes, that if they to Rome appeal'd, They were exempt, and had their Pardons seal'd. While Rebell Becket for poore things withstood His King, the Pope his Shield most firmely stood; And Others of his Ranke hal'd to their Nets, Two English Kings of our Plantagenets. When Milan rose against the Emperour, With other Townes, though not to Babels Towre Subject at all, yet did Pope Gregory, Because the Rebels sought his Amity, Accurse the Third Time Cæsars Majesty: And though some pleaded then a Nullity, Yet no submission served Frederick, But he stands barr'd from the Church Catholick. About the Yeare Two Hundred Thirty Eight With the one Thousand past, for his owne Right The Emperour was then compell'd to Fight, The while the Pope all Cæsars League did smite With Thundring Darts pretended from Saint Paul And from Saint Peter to affright them all. But seeing that such Blasts small terrour strooke, He then proclaim'd the Crosse, and thereby shooke Th' Imperiall League, yet not so fatally, But that his Gibellines stood really, As with the Pope remain'd the Guelphian Side, Which Two did long all Italy divide. Heere ends not all this Centuries Complaint: With farre more dismall Stirres the Pope did taint Those Cloudy Times. The Father dead, he shootes Upon the Sonne his Bolts. It little bootes Him to submit. The Sonne alike must beare His Fathers Curse, and so to Sway forbeare. Conradus dead, he doth for Conradine As much and more, for him he doth confine Not onely from the Empire; But his Owne Of Naples Realme with the Sicilian Crowne He gives away for Prey to Charles of France, Whose Banners there Pope Clement did advance, And never left (such was his Chollers Flame To Conradine for his dead Grandsires Fame) Till he and Austriaes Prince by a sly way Were taken and beheaded in One day, Judge, Readers, now, if Popes liv'd like to Christ, Or whether they resembled Antichrist. So Sly and Cautious were this Ages States, That None for feare to have with Popes Debates For Seventeene Yeares durst hazard on the Mace Imperiall, but the same lay for that Space Still vacant. For Alphonsus King of Spaine Had flat refus'd the Cumbers to sustaine, Least of an ancient Friend, his Ghostly Sire Become his Foe, and so his Love expire; He would not leave, he said, Astronomy Which he then studied, for all Germany. Th' Electours then chose Richard Cornewalls Duke, The Romaines King, but he with some rebuke Was since put off, because his Holidome Expected more of Others for that Roome; And thereupon he Hasburgs Earle enthrones, Since Austriaes Head, with him the Pope attones In Old Lausannaes Towne; but could not get Him once to Rome, lest that his footing set In that unlucky Place, some Jealous Fit Might nip the Popes rash Braine and crazed Wit, That he from thence should never more returne, But perish there, except he serv'd his turne, As Cæsars were before his time to doe Constrain'd, or else his Wrath to undergoe, And to that end the prudent Emperour Rehears'd the Tale, how to the Lions Bowre Who fain'd him sicke, the Fox saw many Beasts To enter in as Complementall Guests, But not the steps of any comming back, And that made him to Rome his Visit slacke. Now at this Ages Period Celestine The Romish Pope was cheated by a fine And Cunning Sleight, the Popedome to resigne To Boniface, himselfe and to confine Into an Hermites Cell, to end his Dayes With Prayers, Fasts, and such Religious wayes. This by a whispring Cane or hollow Reed He acted, and his wish did so succeed. Thus Boniface began. But as such Plots Thrive seldome, so entangled in those knots, Which he for others warp'd, he waged Warres In Italy. In France he moved Jarres Against the King, with Fulminating Darts Against his Realme, till spite of all his Arts His Holinesse Captiv'd, in Prison fast, For very Griefe then he deceas'd at last, With this Memoriall fixed on his Clog: He came a Fox, Raign'd a Wolfe, di'd a Dog. But to encrease Romes Superstitious store, Before his Death he coin'd one Custome more, The Jubilees great Yeare, wherein all such, Who came to Rome, were eas'd of Sinne and Pouch: Eas'd of Sinnes Paine from Purgatories Flame, Eas'd of their Gold as Ransome for the same. This Pope decreed it first with Balaam's Fire, When that One Hundred Yeares did full expire; But since to Fifty Yeares Popes chang'd the Course, That they might reap more Gaine by Gulls recourse, And Pilgrim-Visits of the Lateran, And other Sainted-Fanes late made profane, Since Freedome was proclaim'd by Romish Sires For many Thousand Yeares from Purging Fires. So doth the Mystick Whore entangle Soules To credit Dreames, which raise her Market Tolles. And now likewise for her Gods Adoration Popes first Decreed the Masses Elevation. Thus I winde up this Popish Age, the while I warne thy Wits to greet, O Patricks Ile, Thy Prelate Fitz-Raphe, Primate Armachan, Who 'gainst the Upstart Friers playd the Man, And provd their Begging Orders Vaine and False Before the Pope and all his Cardinalls. So shone that time this Learned Mans Renowne, That when his Death was through Avinion knowne, A Cardinall was heard of Him to say: The Church hath lost a Pillar strong this day. And yet for all such Good mens Prophesies, Rome would not quit her Pedlers Marchandise, Which to her use those Croaking Friers truckt, But by their Lies she all our Honey suckt. (Their Legends wrought such Superstitious Feare.) They saw Our Lady here, Our Lady there, At Mountserrat, Lorrette, Walsingham, Whereby they got, as to th' Ephesian Dame, To Isis, Baal, and Moloch Temples built, And Images with Gold and Azure gilt, By which false specious Showes, old Satans Mists, Rich Offrings they procur'd to Romish Priests. Then, Miracles were rife, of Wise men knowne For Ghostly Wiles, now to a Proverbe growne; That to conclude Some for Notorious Liers, It is enough to say, that they are Friers. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE FOURTEENTH AGE, From the Yeare of our Lord 1300. untill the Yeare 1400. At which time Henry the Fourth Raigned King of England. The Argument. The Fratricells soone up, and quasht. At Masse By Papall Plot then Cæsar pois'ned was. Pope John maintaines, he can all Kings depose. Our Wickliffe now Romes Doctrine doth oppose. About the Dawne of this New Century, The Fratricells of Anabaptists Fry In Germany disperst their Arguments, That Christians should not perk to Governments; But that all things lay Common to the Poore As to the Rich. No Creature lesse or more Then Others must possesse. Equallity They taught of States and Lives Conformity, Much like to that, which Plato Chymeriz'd, Or the Utopian Weale, which Moore devis'd. But their Opinions vanish'd into Smoak, And they themselves endur'd the Churches stroak, Censur'd for Bedlems of Corrupted Zeale, Offensive to the Church and Common-weale, Which without hope of Gaine would slothfull grow: Yet by the Fruit a Christians Faith we know. I wish in Wealth a Meane, from Mizers store A Miracle extended to the Poore. O how my Heart doth grieve to see their Cures Neglected, whilst our Dronish Epicures Most idly waste what Godly Families Would save from Dearth, and serve as Sacrifice To cover Sinnes. We carry hence no Gold Nor Land. Eight Foot alone a Coarse will hold. A friers Act yet hapned to his Liege, Great Luxemboroughs Cæsar, at the Siege Of Florence more prodigious by the Popes Procurement, which quasht sodainely the Hopes And Life of the Imperiall Majesty, (Deciphring Babels black Iniquity) By a Black Frier with a Masses Cake Envenomed, and taen his Heart-strings brake, And so whom Force, nor Flashes could out-brave, One hallowed Bit dispatcht him to his Grave. Nor did the Next succeeding Emperour Much better speed, for he likewise the sowre And crabb'd aspect felt of proud Antichrist. He Lewis dar'd out of the Church of Christ By Thundring Bulls to shut, and made his Boast, That he had Power through the Holy Ghost Both Emperours and Princes to dispose, And at his Will their Kingdomes to transpose. Thus John the Two and Twentieth of that Name On Cæsar play'd, and Scriptures did defame, Untill some Grave and Learned Men arose In that Tempestuous Age him to oppose. Among which Occam started up with Quill Of Cherubs Wing, and prov'd that Doctrine ill. He prov'd the Rule of all this Earthly Ball To appertaine unto States Temporall, And by the Light transferr'd from Holy Scrowles, How Truth exempts no priviledged Soules, No not the Pope himselfe from Cæsars Doome, Since Peter felt by Nero Martyrdome. So to the Glory of the English Race, Who with the First withstood the Papall Mace, He, whom the Godly for his Learned Workes Then styl'd, The Hammer of the Romish Church, On Grosted I reflect, Grave Lincolnes Sire: He stoutly wrot against his Forged Fire, Which netled him so much, that out of hand He would have cited him before his Band Of Pharisees at Tiber to appeare, But that admonish'd by his Councell there, Sage Cardinalls, he was content to passe Him over, lest the Bishop might surpasse Them by his rare incomparable Lore, And winde them in more Mazes then before, Two Ages past had Abbot Ioachim Against Romes Gaine a Prophet been to grim, O Glorious Ile, most happy is thy Fate, Which hadst the Luck first to descry thy State, Thy Churches dolefull state by Babel torne, And with the First to be in Christ New-borne, To shake her Yoak quite off, and to flye out From her Dark Jaile, mauger her Guardians stout. From time to time we read in Antiquaries, God rais'd up some to sound forth Romes Vagaries, Before that Wickliffe stretcht his Lions Paw, One Robert Gall Soule-rapt in Paris saw The Romish Church by Name with Head like Death, And with a Body leane, and scant of Breath: An Angel then, while this sight did appeare, Bad him the Romish Church mark standing there. She in our West was then of small extent, Perhaps retir'd else-where, like Abrams Tent; Or She far'd in that Antichristian Age, Like Babels Jewes, or Saints through Neroes Rage. Heav'ns Path is Narrow, Stiep. Hells Broad, down hill, Good men but Few, the Greatest part are Ill: Yet of those Few 'tis hard to know their Scope: Some sicke, some weake, or of Potentiall Hope, Yet of those Few the True Church is compos'd, And of those Few some were, like Starres, dispos'd By our Good God of Dangers to fore-tell, Whereby the Rest might save themselves from Hell. So Petrarch sung in two-fold Latian Style, And others did in Learned Workes compile Glauncing, nay Striking at Romes Antichrist, And drawing Soules from darke Cimmerian Mist. So Boccace had, although with Tales disguiz'd, The Friers wanton Thefts Epitomiz'd. As likewise those Three Nunnes Canoniz'd Saints, Like Babels Iewes, or Sybills made Complaints; Good Katharine, Bridget, and Hildegard Fore-told our New-mans Armes of safest ward, And that a New Reform'd Presbytery Their Liturgy should quash and Popery. Thus by Records the Churches Race I try, And by Faiths Light her Orient Face descry Like the New Moone approaching from the Wane, And shine more bright in Consciences Humane. By which and by Romes owne Historian Platine, I finde how liv'd the Head of the Church Latine, By Simony, and lewd Magicians Spells, By Murthers, Fraud, and Coining of New Hells, By setting all our Christendome at ods, Because they kneel'd not to his Maumet Gods. With Factious Guelphes, his hurliburles Assignes, He warr'd against the Imperiall Gibellines. Amidst these Broiles and Crimes exorbitant, Christ whistled home his Flock extravagant. Some knew his Sound, and to his Fold return'd, Some staid behinde, and Refractaries turn'd. The First he linkt with his Church Catholick, But left the Latter of the Staggers Sick, And for a Prey to Fiends, because his Call They slighted, and his Cures Angelicall. Such to be gull'd he left by Aiery Elves, But his True Ark he steered free from Shelves. Now with faire Light from famous Oxford rose Our Wickliffe, Romes Foundations to oppose, By certaine Lords and Londoners Support, Which though some crost, yet gave a lowd Report, So lowd, that Husse and Ierome heard from Prague The Noise, and learn'd to flye from Babels Plague, And left to After-times such Fruitfull Seed, That the True Church now glories in the Breed. Then Chaucer by the Freedome of his Rimes Unsilenc'd scan'd the Darknesse of those Times: (Of such strange Force are Tunes of Raptur'd Wits, That they have charm'd and still'd wild Tyrants Fits) He plainely pointed at Romes Antichrist, Admiring at the Clergies stormy Mist, Which did so long our West exagitate, Like them in Zeale, though with unequall Fate, Did the Lord Cobham since, the Bohemes Husse, And those Good Soules in Brittaines Ile discusse Religions state, those whom the Papists then Nick-named for their Faith Just and Fast Men. Whose Manner neere was such as Plany writ To Trajan earst. They, as did Saints befit, Assembled in the Night, sung Psalmes, Receiv'd The Holy Food, and with sweet Trance conceiv'd Christs Mystick Gifts, the New-mans Sacrifice, The Spirits Flame, which Carnallists despise. They liv'd as Brethren, leagu'd in Unity With mutuall Love, and Goods Community, Relieving One anothers Need alwayes, Their owne Iust Fast Mens Need withour delayes. For Pauls Epistles, or th' Apocalipse In English pen'd, because there Babels slips Were prophesied, they grudg'd not to defray Five Sterling Marks, a Scriveners Royall Pay, If we regard the scarcenesse then of Coine, Before Castile did Perues Oare purloine, And which is strange, they seldome mixt their Seed, But with their Mates, lest they might taint their Breed. Fooles styl'd them then, as they now Lutherans, The Knowne Men, or Wicklevian Puritans, The Iust and Fast, or with a Brow more sowre, Them Lollards markt, fr? whence came Lollards Towre. In Wales, About this Ages latter end, Did Blasts from Hell to Friers Braine ascend; False Miracles these Merit-monging Crew Pretended done by Winifride did brew Neere to a Well deriv'd from Rocky Lime, Which Holy they enstyld in that Dark Time, Because the Bloud of that good Virgin there, As they surmizd, was shed, and not else-where: Lord, how they roamd, like wild Geese, on the Fame! And unto Baal with fat Oblations came! All to enrich the Forgers of the Bruit With what they never toyld for, Strangers Fruit! Before which Feat for their Monastick Weale, Their Beggars Wants they knew not how to heale. 'Tis strange to see how soon the World turn'd Whore, When Girald past Two Hundred Yeares before That very Place with an exact Survay, Yet could not learne what men did since display. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE FIFTEENTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 1400. untill the yeere 1500. At which Time Henry the Seventh raigned King in England. The Argument. Our Churches slighted state. Bizantium lost. The Papacie in strife. The Hussites crost For Husse raise War, with Ziscaes Conquests crown'd. Strange Lands by Gama and Columbus found. As I of late Old Rubbage diggd, I felt (With Flaming Force my Perturbations melt, My Passions curbd, my Outward Man of Might Deprivd. And then I had a Ghostly Sight Of Robert Galls Parisian Iack-a-Lent, Whereof the Pope by Carnall Mindes Consent Is Supreme Head on Earth. But soone I saw Both Head and Body burne away like straw; For Both indeed wore brittle Ornaments, And so dissolvd to the First Elements, His Soule descending into Lower Spheares Then those of Purging, which he farm'd for Yeares, Anon I saw with Intellectuall Eyes, From a Dark Iaile a comely Dame arise, When seeing me She stopt her Modest Pace, And like my Saviours Mother, full of Grace, Thou Mortall Man, quoth She, dost wonder now, Why on Poore Thralls my Favours I bestow, And not on Scarlet Robes in midst of Plenty? I dwell not with the Proud; Not one of Twenty, That spends the time in Carnall Jollity, Enjoyes my Love, Heat, or Society; Which Caiphas-like, Pope Adrian true confest, He saw not how Romes Scepter could be blest, Since He, to whom Christ left the Churches Care, Shun'd worldly Rule, Pompe, and Simonious Ware. The Consciences, where I frequent me most; Are styl'd The Temple of the Holy Ghost. And there, no Swine, no Beasts of prey, nor Curres Dare enter once, nor any thing that blurres. Notorious sinnes with Penance I commute, But Common slips to Nature I impute. I never sold the Holy Spirits Gifts, But I receive Strayes gratis without shifts. Though I enjoy the Keyes to bind or loose, I seldome Curse, nor Yealding Reedes do bruize. 'Gainst Hereticks I warre, but not with Sword, My Fence is Vowes and Teares, my Sword Gods Word. For my Chast Faith to Christ I am belov'd, And by his Fiery Crosse I am approv'd, If thou desirest then to finde me out, Looke, VAUGHAN, not for me among the Rout, But with my Babes, which beare a loving Mind, Wise, Constant, sad. And there thou me shalt finde. With such I liv'd in Superstitious Times, And so proclaime me in thy New-mans Rimes. With such I dwelt by Worldlings scorn'd, the while My Beldame Foe Christs Altars did defile, With Carnall Sence and Sacrilegious Rape Moulding th' Immortall in fraile Mortall shape. Thus stood Our Church, though not so faire of Face As she seemes now, yet by Elections Grace, Christs Merits, and his Blouds Prerogative She breathed free from Sinnes imputative, And though her Seed were not so pure as Our, Nor Ours, as Saints, yet may the Man-Gods Pow'r For their Faiths sake Old Passions purifie, When Doomedayes Flames shall Bodies change or try Or rather at Deaths Gaspe to Paradise Convaigh them like the Theefe, with Saints to rise, The Iudge will cloth them with his Robes of Grace, And them enroule with his True Churches Race. Thus stood Our Church most visible to Saints, Ere Lather broke into his Just Complaints. Here in Our West she persecuted lay, While Rome made sale of Soules and open Prey. She in the House of Mourning at the Stake Lay Patient, while Rome forg'd the Masses Cake. How did they her with Racks and Tortures touze Within their Jailes and Inquisition House? How in Old Times did Berengurius fare, For daring to controule corrupted Ware? Nay, how in Spaine doe they speed at this day, Who Christ alone for Advocate display? A thousand Yeares the Dragon with Restraint Of Bloudy Force lay Close. Till then a Saint Possest his Conscience free from Torturos Fire, Or Hells Constraint. No Synod full of Ire, Till the Fourth Henry raign'd, did signe a Law By Massacres poore England to withdraw From preaching Christ. No Councell Generall Doom'd Saints to Flames to end Religious Brawle, Till Sigismond at Constance suffred Husse And Ierome to be burnt without discusse Of their true Cause. Yet Sautre first Of Martyrs did appease the Bloudy thirst Of Antichristian Priests in the First Yeare Of the said Henries Raigne. Next Badby here Thorpe, Purvey, Taylour, White, and Hoveden, With the Lord Cobham, Floure of Noblemen, Who did before the Bishops of this Land, With burning Zeale the Romish Church withstand, For the Faiths sake, and the Wicklevian Sect Did by their Bloud, and Martyrs Seales erect An Altar up in honour of our Christ As Members of their Head 'gainst Antichrist, How many Soules were forced to abjure And to recant! No Saint then liy'd secure In the Three Henries Sway of Lancaster, Who preacht Gods Word, as He of Chichester Grave Peacock felt, and many moe, that far'd As bad because they Babels Whore out-dar'd, Kent, Herefords, and Norwich Diocesse Saw men styl'd Lollards then with like successe Take up the Crosse, and yeeld for Christ their Breath. (So Prelates Saints pursu'd with spite, and Death) And not content the Living to torment, They one Degree beyond the Pagans went, For Wickliffs Bones from out the Grave they tore, And burnt, which lay there Forty Yeares before. With solemne Pomp and Degradations Maske, Those Gotam-Scribes perform'd that Gothish Taske. O would the Lines of this Epitome Could move our Strayes, which haunt the Romish Sea, To meditate on Times Old Monuments, And there to marke what Savage Punishments One Hundred Yeares, ere Luther rose, were then Inflicted by mad Priests on Christian Men, For seeking to reforme Old things amisse, And by Gods Word to win blind strayes to Blisse: I might then hope some would relent and turne To our New-man, and with New Zeale would burne, Not heeding Dreames and Superstitious Mists, Which spred abroad by false Masse-monging Priests, And Idoliz'd by haughty Hildebrand, Lay yet on Rome an Ignominious Brand; But noting what the New-man put in ure The first Six Hundred Yeares, they hold most pure. For such our Martyrs di'd, and such I know Great Brittaine now extolls, at least in show. But to review the Churches History, The Looking-Glasse of Sacred Memory: Whilst halfe this Age with doubtfull chance embroils, Which France shall feel, or England Bloudier Broiles? The Center of this Age melts into Teares, And cryes out shame upon our Westerne Peeres, For suffring Turkes Bizantium to possesse, And by that meanes quite to subvert the Peace Of all the Easterne Church, and there for Christ To fiixe a mighty Limbe of Antichrist. Had they in time but seconded the Duke Of Burgundy when he Thralls a rebuke With a Check-mate receiv'd in Hungary, The Ottomans had not faire Bulgary Subjected, nor the Græcian Iles since won To Christians Losse, and Mahomets renowne, But as with Cunning Plots the Dragon rac'd Our Westernes Faith, so then he there defac'd With Open Force the Easternes Primest Seat, The City of New Rome; in which Defeat He glories, that the same with Salems Towne, And Antioch he from Servile Christians won. Their Sinnes them servile made, that so before The Iudgement Day their Fall might Others more Rowze up from Sloth and Dull Security To Watch, least they feele more Indignity. And then neere Thirty Yeares were past, since Popes Branding each Other for false Antipopes Copartners, at a Councell Generall By Sigismonds good Cares they stint the Brawle. At which I cannot in my Zealous Trance Unnamed leave a Chancellour of France, Grave Gerson, whom our Chronicles record, That for Truths Rights to be againe restor'd He motion'd to bring back the Light Divine, As in the Dayes of Paul or Constantine. This he crav'd in the Councell Generall Most Zealous, but the State Pontisicall Would not assent to heare of Reformation, Lest they might clinch their Court of Augmentation, Like Politicks, who winke at Theeves or Stewes, At Spoiles or Bribes, at Barrettours or Iewes, Encreasing Sinne, and what to Vengeance tends For Private Gaine, and their owne Idoll-ends. This Motion made that Clerk Magnanimous About the Time, when there they burned Husse, That Husse, who sung, that tho they broil'd the Goose, Within One Hundred Yeares should be let loose A Swan out of those Flames, as white as Snow, Whose pow'rful Tune wuld make more Eares to glow. Which Prophesie fell true, for the Events Gamaliels-like since answered the Contents. Yet did that Councell doe one piece of Worth, For they depos'd Three Popes, and chose a Fourth. But afterwards the Cæsar Sigismond For Breach of Faith by deare Experience conn'd, That though, as Toyes, wrongs Mortalls over-passe, Yet God will them not unrevenged passe, For of the Breach soone as Bohemia heard, The Safe-conduct infring'd, the Cause unheard, And that the Councell had condemned Husse And Ierome to be burnt without discusse Of the maine Points of Faith, for which they came By Safe-conduct sign'd in th' Imperiall Name: And now affronted with this fond Reply, Or rather jeer'd with a Priscillian Lye: That Promise, Faith, and Vowes to Horeticks Were voyd in Law, if made by Catholicks; The Taborites repin'd, faire Prague laments, And all Bohemia moves with sodaine Rents, For their late Prophets Death, and Guiltlesse Bloud Shed for no cause, but that they Rome withstood. Then Valiant Zisca, like the Sonne of Nun, Heads against Cæsar, many Battels won, And with small Numbers to all the Popists Wonder Great Armies daunts, as strook with claps of Thunder, The Bohemes so against their Foes prevail'd, That they their Losse, and Breach of Faith bewail'd; And to this day those Rites in Boheme last, Which first to Husse from English Wickliffe past. Nor was that Doctrine in Bohemia close, And England kept alone, but to oppose The Romish Side by Vertue of the Light Deriv'd from thence there daily came more Might. The Bishop of Croatia then did rise By Wickliffes Lamp, and did Romes Fall comprise In Measur'd Lines, which with Prophetick Glosse Vicelius did sort that Dark Age disclose. Cameracums Good Cardinall then wrot, And laid on Rome an everlasting Blot, As others in those Dayes the like reveal'd What from Old muddy Pates stood long conceal'd. So Montuan did and Savonarola, Clemangis, and the Count Mirandola Boldly declaime against Great Babels Pride, Ere Luther rose to write against her Side. For now had God in his appointed Time Refin'd more Wits the Gospel out to chime. Though for their Sinnes he Pius tooke away The Best of Popes, who whilst he liv'd, gave way Some Errours to reforme, and meant that Wives Should licenc'd be to Priests, yet still he lives For his Good Will enrowl'd in Lines of Fame, That Silvius thought to cover Babels shame. For like Effect God sent the Printers Presse, That with Good Bookes we might his Truth confesse, For till this Age faire Printing lay unknowne, And so for want of Workes Truth was prest downe. Gunnes likewise came within this Ages List, Invented by by a Frier Alchymist, Now Beades came up, where Sixtus was not wary For Penance sake to linke the Ave-Mary. And after him, by the next raving Pope, Who for his Fact was worthy of a Rope, Romes Stewes came up, for whom he builded Roomes, And got the Whores to pay him Yearely Summes, Under pretence to keep some Women Chaste, But more for Gaine, and for his Priests unchaste, As though the Brothels could Knaves temptings let, By suffring Ill, Sinne Hidraes to beget. What now hath Rome to plead? what Colour? Shift? Or false Demurre to cloak her wanton drift? That she be not indited hereupon A Baud? and styl'd the Whore of Babylon, Not onely Ghostly, but a Carnall Whore She stands arraign'd; for, as yee heard before, A Whore indeed, a Woman Moguntine Sate Pope in Rome, and acted Rites Divine. If this be not sufficient Evidence, Examine well their Lives and Fraudulence, What Paramours Popes kept? what Bloudy Dance They led? what Plots their Bastards to advance? That very Pope, which shall cloze up this Age, Can restifie with what tumultuous Rage He rais'd his Sonne and Daughter to great States: Cæsar made Duke, a Duke Lucretia mates. About the Yeare Six Hundred Sixty Six, The Antichristian Fiend began his Tricks And Lullabies to act through Carnall Ease, That men might fall to Scorbuts Foule disease, Or to some Frantick Fits. Nor was it long But at the Time foretold, who did belong To the Great Cities Dame, by Sea and Land Playd the fond Bedlems at their Heads command. Her huge Impostume broke out at the last, That in Five Hundred Yeares she made such wast Of Ragges for Tents to keep her Issues running, To serve her still it past our Westernes cunning. The Prince of Fiends such Humours, Spleen, and Gall Envenom'd had this Mystery withall, That for Guaiacam she must India riste, For Europes Drugges seem'd to her Lims a Trifle. Who durst oppose her what she went about? She had the Keyes of Heaven and Hell to boot: Of all the World she was Chiefe Governesse, And of what Christ scorn'd in the Wildernesse. Only there wanted to supply her State The Genoaes Map, and Isabellaes Fate. Before her Wane Gods Glory to extend, It chanc'd about this Ages Latter End, That Gama first from Lisbon tri'd the Course, To passe by Sea to the East-Indian Shores, Where having found the Load-stone since in use, He Pilots did from the Pole-starre reduce; By which and Printing was the Gospels sound Dispers'd, and Both within this Age New-found. West-India then was was by Columbus seene, At the Expence of that Castilian Queene; Who pawn'd her Jewels for the finding out Of those New Lands, whose Gold made Spain so stout, That aiming at the Westerne Monarchy. She Musters, Fights, holds Kings in Jealousie: And Babels Whore hopes in that New-found Soile By Mart of Soules to keep more revell Coile, And what She here hath by the Gospel lost, That to repaire in Indiaes Sun-burnt Coast. Our Seventh Henry might have made his Boast, Had he but been as prone as Ferdinand To take the tendred Map of that New Land. But though the Tract was large, yet Portingall And Castiles King contended, till the Brawle By the High Priests Imaginary Lines Umpir'd, they claim'd more then their Right confines, And so Romes Rites erected in that Coast, Satan repaires what he in Europe lost, Unlesse our Ile, to countepoise his Craft, Had lately aim'd into that North a Shaft, Which may perhaps some Consciences so wound, That Savages may heare the Gospels Sound, Which others Damps with Superstitious Fire Have there conceal'd, and hindred to inspire. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE SIXTEENTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 1500. untill the yeere 1600. The Argument. Where lay Our Church ere Wickliffe first arose: By Prodigies Rome warn'd ere Luther rose. No Tyrants Plots could let Our Churches Sound, But Englands Queene did all her Foes confound. From Age to Age I shew'd the Churches race, Her Wane, her Wens, &amp; her refulgent Face; And some I nam'd for Prophetizing Wits In Elder Times against our Belials Fits, Who goe about by asking with Proud Sence Where was Our Church? to chaine Gods Providence, Like to those Doctours and Mosaicall Scribes, Who labour'd to suppresse what Christ prescribes? Besides th' Abissines under Pretious Iohn, Th' Armenians, Greekes, and Some in Babylon, Or otherwhere. (For who dares bound our Guest? Since we are ti'd likewise to Judge the Best?) And not to bind Gods free unbounded Grace To any certaine Climate, Times, or Place?) Christ had his Church, a Remnant sav'd by Grace Alwayes inspir'd in some or Other Place; Whether our Scribes pretend them Coloieros, Nestorians, Monkes, or Saint Iohns Cavalleros, Whether they hold of Persian Iacobites, The Hussites Forme, or of Georgiaes Rites; Of Maronites or Cofties of the East, Or Catholicks so craking in the West Or Hermites, Nunnes and Voluntaries Poore, Whose humbled hearts then Pomp Saints honour more Because they side with Christ, beare Christian Name, Though much in Blame, yet I will spare their Fame; And let our Weaklings know, that some were Wise, And did of Old in Babel Sybillize; By speciall Signes and Sympromes generall, But most by Sacred Starres Authenticall, Denouncing for her Slips Gods Wrath, her Fall, Unlesse she would Repent her at their Call. And so things came to passe, as they Divin'd, Her Spires for Rookes we now demolisht find, Some by the Force of furious Ottoman, Some forfeited for what the Lawes did scan: Her Chappels turn'd to Barnes, or Nests for Owles, Her Nunneries first built for harmelesse Soules Lye wast with her Rich Temporalls and Rents; Yea, and Gods Tythes, Our Church-emoluments, By what just Warrant let the Lawes dispute, Some keepe away as yet; and I am Mute, Because I see sometimes that Innocence, Aswell as Vice, dies of the Pestilence, An Order laid Pope Alexander downe For the New World. But shortly of his Owne Most wretched States and Life shall be bereft, And for Usurpers an Example left. For after this usurpt Partition made, His Bastard Sonne to try his Former Trade Of Pois'ning Those, whom he suppos'd would barre The Proud Designes of his complotted warre, His Motto blaz'd, the Hazards Die is cast, Cæsar, or Nothing, now by Poisons Tast He meant to rid Suspected Cardinalls Out of the way, but hereby both their Falls, His Fathers and his Owne, he sodaine wrought, For he soone as the Fatall Wine was brought, Charged his Page, that he the Bottle watch, And when he call'd for Wine, that he should reach It for his Guests; the Pope came in the while, And thirsty call'd for Wine: the Page the Wile Not knowing, thought the Wine reserv'd was Choise, And without more adoe, or Answers Noise, Fill'd him a Cup of the Empoisned Wine, And by just Doome, as writeth Guiccardine, Came in the Authour, his accursed Sonne All thirsty too, and tasted thereupon The Cup which he for Others brew'd, and lost His Father out of hand, himselfe almost Ran the same Fate, but that by Nature strong, He for that time escap'd to doe more wrong, Still quarrelling, till he was thrall'd and slaine. So Cæsar Borgias liv'd and di'd a Caine. Pope Julius now to Tiber slung his Keyes, Then fought, and lost by French his Enemies, A Token that Romes Church to wrack began To fall, as you may by the sequele scan. The Outward Crosse in Teutons Soile appear'd Of Martyrs Forme, and with that Signe besmear'd Their Palaces, and Houshold Ornaments, Their Windowes, Doores, and Bodies Vestiments; A signe to shew the Fiery Trialls Doome By Factious Gogs and Magogs Force to come, Veil'd with the Crosse, the Keyes, with Peters Net, With Iesus, with the Lawes, or Mahomet. This Miracle in Maximilians Time Fell out, not long before the Gospels Chime At Wittemberge with Motions life began By Luthers Zeale, that good Samaritan, Who, when most shunn'd to helpe the wounded Man, Cheer'd up, and Bath'd Christs Members pale and wan. And after this another Prodigy Befell to Rome, which no Apology Of Idolists can cover the mis-hap; When little Iesus from his Mothers Lap Was in the Church remov'd, and Peters Keyes Throwne from his Pictures hand, Both in a trice VVithout respect of Persons by the stroke Of Thunders Crack and sacred Sulphures Smoake Just in that Church, where One and Thirty Priests VVith the Red Hat that Day, like Minstrellists, Installed were by Leo there with state In the same Yeare, when Luther to abate His Loftinesse began with greater Fame Then Cardinalls support, in Christ his Name. Our Kings and States of Westerne Christendome Complain'd and sought for some Redresse to come Of Faiths abuse, and Romes Impiety, But still the Head was deafe to Piety, He would no Member be, but the Church whole, Himselfe sole Iudge, and Church, without one Mole, Or Sinfull Spot, by which Prerogative He tyrannized so, that none could thrive; He watcht with Vultures Clawes all Stakes to sweep: He watcht to slay, but not to feed the Sheep, Like Maltaes Iew, or those of Lawlesse kind, Who under Maske of Law cease not to grind Christs Members, till they feele Hells measures heapt, Or till they reape what Old Masse-mongers reapt. So blinded were the Popes by Doome Divine, Till a Poore Man, a Frier Augustine, Since started up to doe that Glorious Deed, Which Gregories, and Austines doth exceed, Which Kings assay'd, but failed to performe: Nay, Kings durst not what Luther did reforme. Would God that some like Prophet took the Paines To bring back Love for which our Church complains. This Wonder God wrought in our Latter Dayes, That before Doome he might recall some Strayes, That Satans Pride he might by Sucklings tame, And by the Weak the Worldly Wizzard shame. Well neere upon our Luthers Sacrifice, Grave Reuclin did and Valla breake the Ice, As London was prepar'd by Golets Flame, And Dutch-land by the Clerk of Rotterdame; As Swizzer Land, when Luther first began, By Zuinglius was stirr'd up Romes zeale to scan. But none then our Iust Fast Men triumph'd more, Whose Race had held full Sixscore Yeares before VVith Faggots Fire, and Lollards branded Paine Pursu'd till now, and now rejoyc'd againe, To see that Faith, which with the Hussites they Had long maintain'd, found out an open way By Luthers Zeale, Stigelius ravisht Muse, And by Melancthons Flowres with blooming Newes. Babel her Fall in Henries Time foresaw, VVhen Premunire Englands ancient Law Her Clergy rackt. But most she quakt for Dread To heare him styl'd the Churches Supreme Head: For by that Style what Rome usurped heere Of Aunates, Farmes, and Duties every Yeare, Our Parliament had on the King conferr'd To aide him in his Warres. These Spoiles transferr'd From Forraigne use to help the Natives want: 'Tis strange to mark how soone men did recant Their Carnall Dreames, and blind Idolatries, To celebrate the New-mans Sacrifice. Blest be Young Edward, Our Iosides Name, Who next commenc'd this Work of Pious Fame. But as the Former Brood, when Constantine Deceas'd, then prou'd ingratefull, the Next Ligne Of Cæsars fell to Arrian Heresie, And their Old Vomits with Apostasie: So wavering England in the Marian Raigne Quickly return'd to Babels yoak againe, Untill some Martyrs Blood, the Churches Seed, True Members of their Head in time of Need Had through Gods Grace behind them left a Fire, As Latimer foretold, which would inspire, And never be extinct in Albions Ile, Whilst that Our Kings beare Faiths Defenders Stile. This by our Virgin Queene of Tydirs Race, Great Debora, was since made good to raze, And quite demollish here Romes strongest Fort, And chiefest Nerves, which did her Pride support, And surely, if Romes Tributary Thralls Would take that Course, she on a sodaine falls. Her Lofty Towres would yeeld so loud a Crack That they, which Court her now, would soon go back, When startled up at the New wondrous Sight, They see a Church more Catholick of Light: They would avouch no Advocate but One, And build their Faith upon the Corner Stone, That was hewne from the Mountaine without hand, Male-borne without Male-Sire in Iewry Land. They would exalt Our Church Apostolick Above their Owne, the Carnall Catholick, And by Gods Word, Truths ground, the Churches note, They would conclude what now they con by roat. About the midst of this strange Century, Iniquities prodigious Mystery Began at Trent, or City Tridentine, Againe to play upon the Word Divine By Canons propt with Iulians Tyranny, More fit for Moores then Councells harmony. Least that the Gospel should Romes Captives free From their Old doating Dreames, they did decree, That all such Bookes, which Protestants had pen'd To blaze Gods Word, they should in pieces rend; Or if they toucht her Carnall Copy-hold, To Martyr them, since Babel aimes at Gold; And that who did gaine-say in Word or Deed, Or tooke it not as Parcell of their Creed, That the whole Masse both for the Dead and Quick Suffic'd, those Men they doom'd no Catholick; That, who beleev'd not all the Romish Crewes Traditions, they were worse then Turks or Iewes. Such Acts at Trent were last determined By the Fourth Pius, Romes most impious Head, With Thundring Threats. Fr? whence arose those Jars, Combustions, Powder-plots, and Bloudy Warres, Which ever since embroiled Christendome, And will (I feare) untill the Day of Doome Endure, unlesse our head-strong Strayes afford, While Time remaines, more Passage to Gods Word. None can deny, but that this Councell gave More Liberty for Papists to out-brave The Church Reform'd by Inquisitions strict To rack poore Soules, and by severe Edict On Forfeiture of Life and Goods Escheat, If they would not adore the Papall Seat. From hence began the Civill Warres in France, Which ended not but by most Bloudy Dance. And various sort of Massacres and Spoiles. They ended not for all their Leaguers Broiles, Untill their Kings, the Guisians, and their Chiefes, Who sided in the Quarrell, di'd in Griefes, In Anguishes and Bloud. And this the Starre In Seventy Two, which past all Comets farre For strange Portent and Blazing-bearded Rayes, Did then denounce with woes to stubborne Strayes, For Belgiaes injur'd States did thereupon Incenc'd by Alvaes Duke, and Austriaes Iohn, Who would have forc'd to Masse mens Consciences, Breake into warres against Spaines Out-rages; Which last as yet. So likewise Portingall, With her Sebastian did in Affrick fall, Enduc'd to fight with Moores by Iesuites Traine, That Philip by his Death might ceaze all Spaine, Excluding Don Antonio and his Race. Quite from the Sway of Lisbons Royall Mace. But to retire to our French Leaguers back, How Fatall prov'd their Plots? They thought to sack And ransack all the Townes, which Protestants, For their Defence then held. But in their wants God aided these, and on their Foes return'd The Tragick Flames, wherwith they would have burn'd Their Neighbors Roofes, Guise arm'd agaist his King, The King, 'gainst him, till Both felt Judgments sting, Both di'd in Bloud, yea, which appear'd most rare, The King was caught in the same Bloudy Snare, Where he in time fore-past had leagu'd the Death Of Saints, whereby Catillion lost his Breath, For in that very Roome the King was slaine By Friers hands, where first was laid that Traine. Long liv'd Our Queen to build things out of square, A Virgin vow'd to Christ, of Dowries rare, Excelling in the Gifts of Tongues and Arts; But more then all shone her Diviner Parts. Church-Elders She propt up, when Some their Fall, As if their State toucht not the Temporall, For Lucre sake had plotted to deface Our Churches Forme, her Frame, and Outward Face, Whereby her Sway had prov'd an Anarchy, Of scorned stemme, the House of God a Sty, And Learning held in vile Contempt for lack Of Wages due; yea, all had gone to wrack, If this Good Queene had not supported them, Who holp to build our New Ierusalem. In her Buddes-time, to counterpoize, or let Our Churches Growth, or in her Tents beset To ruine some of our good Souldiers, sprung The Iesuites Sect with the False Serpents Tongue Disguis'd with Zeale, and promising to Youth Mountaines of Rules, New Documents for Truth. Upon which Newes, and Newnesse of their Name, Degrading Antioch, and the Christian Fame, They wan Repute in Babel. But of late Discreeter States their Bloudy Doctrine hate. Among these Frogs croakt Mariana first Against all Kings, who were by Popes Accurst, And by Blacke Rules deriv'd from Hells Abysse, Dethron'd them of their States for their Amisse. Yea, and their Lives subjected unto Slaves. With such lewd Points, wherein this Jesuite raves, He Campians Braine so stuff'd, that Irelands Realme And Desmonds Crew he poisned with the streame; For which his Plots and false Conspiracies, Himselfe became a Damned Sacrifice; As well deserv'd the Authour for his Bookes Entangling Christians with such Hellish Hookes, But all their Plots of Pistolls, Poison, Swords, Nor Romish Bulls, nor Briefes lowd thundring words, Could shorten or impeach Elizaes Raigne, But that she thriv'd in spight of Rome and Spaine, While they prevail'd with Fatall wound to sting One whom they tooke for the most Christian King; Which Deed so pleas'd Pope Sixtus, that he durst With Iudith ranke the Malefactour Curst. This Sixtus dar'd to Excommunicate Our Famous Queene, her Empire to translate, As much as in him lay, and Leave to gore Her Person gave, as Pius did before. But all their roaring Bulls and Thunderclaps With Interest return'd, with heavy Raps Upon themselves, their Faction, and on those, To whom they dream'd her Kingdomes to transpose. Under his shrowd, who from a Fishes Craw Did Toll for Christ and his owne Person draw. In the meane time faire Englands Zealous Queene, Like Char-coale sparks, contemn'd their flashing spleen. And for her Zeale God blest her brave Attempts, That she cri'd Quittance for his slight Contempts Of Neighbours Love with the Great King of Spaine, Who suffred still his Inquisitions Traine, Under pretext of their Religions Lawes, To prey upon her Merchants without Cause, And on their Goods: or sheading of their Bloud; Or Galley-slav'd; or to weare Benets Hood. These wrongs by Drake and Candish she redrest, And fear'd not to encounter him at Best With all his Navall Force in Eighty Eight. And afterwards at Cales she shew'd her Might. Nor went his Indies free from her Revenge, Nor Belgiaes Soile, but that she did avenge Her Quarrell full, by Force of Armes transverse The Belgian State, and free the Hollanders From th' Inquisitions Yoake by Alva laid, And sithence train'd their Milk-sops by her Aide To turne brave Souldiers both on Sea and Land, To weary Spaine, and on their Guard to stand. After that Bloudy Feast in Seventy Two, When Sions Church French Herods would undo, Besieged Rochell with Munitions store By Sea she furnisht, and Reliev'd her Poore. Againe, France tasted of her Lenity, As Burbon tri'd and his Posterity, Which but for her good Cares, and Troupes Supply, Had stoupt unto Iberiaes Tyranny; And Lorraines League then mammockt into Parts Had thrall'd all France to Spaines Superiour Darts. She planted Ireland, civilliz'd the Rude, Rebellious, Wild, and Kernish Multitude; And neere her Set by Valiant Mount joyes Cares, With Triumph there o're Spaine she cloz'd her Warres. So stood out State of Church and Common-weale, In spight of Romish Bulls, Spaine, and Oneale, Secur'd fr? Schismes, Home-broyles, and Hostile Traine, As long as Great Elizabeth did Raigne. Hereby Our Strayes, who taxe the Gospels Sound, May feare how they Gods Church do meere and bound Within Romes Fold by Popes Prerogative, As if our Faith were pinn'd unto his Sleeve. Here they may see what ignominious Spoiles Romes Champions reapt for all their Bloudy Broiles; Whilst that Our Princes in set Peace have stretcht Their Limmes, in Bloud their latest Gasp they fetcht. Not Austria, France, nor Rome with steely dint, Nor Marian Fire could Christ his Gospel stint, Nor could they raze the Name of Huguenots, Or Protestants for all their Bloudy Plots. Much lesse could their School-Doctors plead her Cause Against the Brightnesse of the Spirits Clause, Which by Saint Iohn had prophesied her Fall, And likewise her forewarned by Saint Paul, That she, whom for her Faith Renowned Fame Then blaz'd, should be at last cut off with shame, If she continued not, as she begun, Chast to her Spouse the Great Iehovahs Sonne. Gods Charter still goes with a whilest, or If Thou honour me, I will remove thy Griefe. Not her Decline could all her Clergy stop, Nor Canonists her Doctrine underprop; Not Gratian, nor her Best, Panormitan, Nor all her Routes of Thalmudists prophane; Not Wolsey, Poole, nor learned Cajetan, Kings-mating Cardinalls in Pomp Humane, The Mystick Remnant of the Dragons Band, Could vengeance stay, nor Iudgements Lees withstand. Their Martyrs Urnes can no way paralell Our Holy Ones, nor can their Legends tell Five Bishops burnt for their Religions sake, Where we can name consumed at the Stake Great Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Latimer, And Ferrar Sainted in our Register, With many moe, whom the Force Secular, Hells Magogs, hois'd to Martyrs Calendar, Though them they knew to be the Churches Seed, By hearing at their Death their Christian Creed: Which Creed, lest it might move a Conscience soft, Their Torturers have interrupted oft In midst of Flames, by hurling Staves or Stones, To wound the more their Heads and broiling Bones. O Valiant Men, true Members of our Head! Who like to Him for Him to Death have bled! O Glorious Saints, who left such Monuments Surpassing farre the Seven-fold Wonderments! Who to prevent Soules Dearth built Granaries, Like Josephs store, inough for Sacrifice! Whose Martyrdomes refulgent Memory Puts downe Romes Palles, and Shrines Imagery! Who have, like Starres deriv'd from Heavens Light, Left Spectacles and Torches for our Sight! God grant they may increase Devotions Flame, And dul those Schismes, which the next Age wil shame. In Briefe, no Age since Christ saw greater Change Of Manners, Knowledge, States, and which is strange, Great Rome twice sackt. The C?mon Foe more bold, Whilst our Chiefe West wav'd with the Spanish Gold. THE OCCVRRENCES OF THE SEVENTEENTH AGE, From the yeere of our Lord 1600. untill this present yeere 1640. Being the 16. of King Charles his Raigne over Great Brittaine. The Argument. Our Church escapes the Dragons Powder-traine; And is confirm'd in James, and Charles his Raigne. Abroad the Bloudy Crosse her Members smites; In Brittaine some blame Types, and Outward Rites. The third Yeare past of this our present Age, Our Sun-set Queen expir'd her Pilgrimage A Virgin on our Virgin Ladies Eve. To see her Starre Death did her hence bereave. Elizabeth then folding up her Raigne Of Forty Foure, Triumphant over Spaine, The Popish Side, Tirone, and Irish Kernes; Faire Englands Crowne to Him whom it concernes By Right of Bloud descends, to Salomon, Our Phœnix Iames, who like the radiant Sunne Shot forth his Rayes, of Kings the Paragon; A Writer most acute, for Natives Tone Unparalell'd by any Regall Scribe, Next to that Starre, the Honour of his Tribe. Whether in Prose or Measur'd Lines he steeres, The Loadstone of his Labours still appeares Directly aim'd unto the New mans White. His Davids Psalmes our Belials so appall, None dare them now Geneva-jigges mis-call. This Posthume Fruit hath Learned Sterline late Set forth, the Fainting Soule to recreate. His Workes endure the Light, his Lamp the Night Of Ignorance repells, and None our Iames, His Bookes, his Life, or Raigne, save Envie blames. He Vorstius foil'd, restrain'd Superfluous Doubts, And by his Pen convinc'd Scholastick Routs. While here he liv'd, O how did Knowledge shine! The Church renew her Hopes, the Grave Divine Affoord us daily Manna for Soule-Food, And by his Royall Rayes all things did Bud, Yea, his Rayes made the Wildest Red-shanks tame, Dri'd Irish Bogges, and spred Virginiaes Fame. Nor lackt this King the Gift of Prophesie, To pry into the Jesuites Secrecie, Whereby they thought to blow up Albions State With Powder-Traine Hells next obnoxious Fate. For though that Tressams Lines seem'd intricate, Flowing from Sphynx, or Cœdipus his Pate, A Riddle, darke, and scorn'd by Other Men, Yet this Wise Prince the same did not contemne, But pointed at the Mine, and their Intent, Which they kept close sworne on the Sacrament. This Peacefull King upon the least disgust Among his Neighbour States, or Warres mistrust, Spar'd for no Paines nor Charge to mediate A Christian End, their Passions to abate. How many Treaties hath Vienna seene? What Embassies to calme fierce Austriaes Spleen? That without Bloud the Palatine might gaine His Owne, he sent his onely Sonne to Spaine. In hope to shunne th' Events, which hapned since, To Dangers he expos'd our Darling Prince, That by that gentle Course or Sacrifice, He might prevent ensuing Prejudice. No Age paints out, nor points at the like Type Of Princely Love, Offence away to wipe. Like Iames in Zeale came Young Iehosaphat, Our Royall Charles, whose sweet and moderate Condition yeeld us Hopes, that, like his Sire, He will retaine unquencht the Sacred Fire, Which in his Soule burnes calmely by the Heat Of Heavens Flame, the Holy Paraclete: Now in his Raigne we plant Virginiaes North With Colonies, and hope by setting forth The Gospel there the Savages to winne In Christ his Name from Lust and Bloudy Sinne. Our Drones turne Bees in his Auspicious Raigne, Remov'd to Forraigne Iles in hope of Gaine, And by his Famous Glasse, who built of Old, For Tharsus Ships to fetch thence Ophirs Gold, This Prudent Prince prepares a Warre-like Fleet To scowre the Seas, and Force with Force to meet, As testifie of late his Admiralls, Which forced Moores to yeeld home English Thralls. But more then all, the New man he doth grace, And the Divine holds in his Counsaile Place. While Mars went on the Electours wings to pull, Against the Charter of the Golden Bull, Distressed Teutons Limmes found both reliefe And Succour of our Charles, to ease their Griefe. And while their Church with Tortures lay opprest, Her Babes exil'd: our Brittaine Mother blest Thrives by the Cares of our Religious Charles, Secur'd from Schisme, and Superstitious Snarles. O happy Brittaine, couldst thou know thy Good Where Neighbor-states ore-flow with Spoiles &amp; Bloud To calculate who were by Warres extinct In Belgia, France, and Germanies Precinct, Or the late Troubles of the Valtoline, The Grisons Griefes, or Rochels to define, A Buskin craves more then Poeticall, Or Algebraes Points Mathematicall. Nay, he that counts the Scarres in Christian Lands, On Christian Folkes late made by Tyrants hands, Shall sooner tell the Names of Magogs Bands, Which Iohn compares unto the Ocean Sands. All which the Saints, though in their Tents beset By Fiends, yet them from Vowes no Crosses let. All which Gods Church, though oftentimes she feares, And vents forth Angels Mones, with Patience beares. Our King bewailes their Case, stands on Defence; He Armes, and yet not ministers Offence. We feele their Griefes, with them we sympathize, And pray for Cure, which Passion mollifies. When Austriaes Cæsar had with Eagles Wings Aspir'd, and lift against the King of Kings His lofty Head, and muster'd all his Force To trample on Christs Flocke without remorce, Having begun the Electours Plumes to pull Against the Germane Lawes and Golden Bull: Ev'n then (O Wonder!) unexpected Aide Was by the Lord from Swethens Land convai'd, From the farre North brave King Gustavus came, Who came like Thunder, fought, and overcame. And though this Heros perish'd for our Sinnes In Battell late, yet to the Philistines, Like Sampson, he full dearely sold his Breath, Confounded them, and Triumph'd by his Death; Yea, from his Cinders since sprung up a Flame, Which Tyrants Threats, and Turncoats puts to shame, Long may thy Trophees last, Great Macchabee, All Terrour to our Foes, untill they see, That they who wittingly shead Christians Bloud, Like Romaine Pilate, and the Iewish Croud, Stand guilty all of Christ his Death againe, And cannot Purge, or wash away the staine With Bribes, or Ransome of Sophistick kind, Besides the Scandall which they leave behind, That Tearing Bonds of Christian Unity Confirmes the Turke by their Hostility To flout, and them with faigned Leagues to wind, As shortly his Confederates may find. Meane while they wast a Christian Monarchy, And Teutons Land becomes an Anarchy. But leaving them with Fire and Sword to skuffle, I saw Our Churches Foes begin to shuffle Strange Cards, in hope by Arts Legier-de-maine To win. The Stake is Soule prodigious Gaine, Which God avert, and grant that we take heed Of Sheep-skin'd Wolves, who sacrifice their Seed To Moloch, and expect for Ioviall Nunnes To be Confest by Romes unmarried Sonnes. This Women styld the Iesuitrices, Did lately presse, that they by their Accesse To Ladies might for their Conversion speed, And work upon their Owne fraile Sexes Creed With greater sleight, and with more fervency Then Priests oft blurr'd for Carnall Privacie. This Femall Sect, before it grew to height, Was by the present Pope, Urbans the Eight, Dasht in the Spring. A prudent Act indeed, To stint the Growth of Antichristian Seeds, God grant him more such Sparkes, that as his Book Of Poems bruites his skill, so he the Hook And Fishers Net convert to better use Then Other Popes have done to Faiths abuse, The which he may, like Peter or Saint Paul, Soone bring to passe by Counsell Generall; Yea, and perhaps he may there Reconcile Those Worldly Jarres, which blur Old Antiochs stile. For what poor things wuld some disguiz'd with zeale Disturbe the Peace of Christ his Common-weale? Some startle at the Altars Ancient Name; Others our setled Forme of Vowes defame. Because they want some businesse from without, To make their Bodies sweat, or smart, they pour, And peevish grow, not knowing what they aile Within their Sickly Braine, till Eits prevaile; Like idle Maids with the Greene-sicknesse vext, They loath what's good, and inward are perplext With brackish Fleame, with Moodes extravagant, And Longings oft from Reason discrepant. Because they cannot have their owne Chymeres And whimseyes of their Will, they wast with Feares, Repining at their Neighbours store of Grace, And yet their Crazed selves will not embrace The tendred Forme, nor joine in the Soule-Cure, As Others do, and with sweet Sauce procure, Whereby they may with Understanding Pray. And not by roat, nor rashly Vowes repay. Glutted with Quailes, and Mannaes precious Fare, Their stomacks long for Onions, homely ware, And Simple Trash, which may the Bloud inflame More then that wholesome Food, which they defame. Have we not seene more Pride in Course Attire Then in Rich Robes? Yea, some, who did aspire Under the Mask of plaine Sincerity, Yet afterwards strove for Priority? Let him, that blames the Surplice comely weare, Looke how the Saints in long-white Robes appeare Before the Highest Throne, and then no doubt At such a Sight he will no longer pout. And who is he so frowardly severe, That rayles at Graduates Hood of Minnivere? The Scarlet Robe? or at the Corner'd Cap In Academes Matriculated Lap, Like Laureate Wreathes, borne and produc'd to grace Industrious Wits, the Churches hopefull Race? That with such Types and Tokens garnished The Bees from Drones might be distinguished? And that by Vertues Hire, faire Honours Crowne, Some might, as Starres, from Lesser Lights be known? Much more distinct the Sacred Ranke had need From Vulgar Garbes of Grave and Reverend Weed, Aswell to move regard by Outward Hew Of Surplices and Miters, as to shew To hardned Romaine Strayes, that without stings We joyne with them in all Indifferent Things, And that to shun Offence, Faiths Essence sav'd, We can forbeare, and yeeld to them that rav'd In clozing Rents, for some Traditions, Rites, And Outward Formes, so to renew their Lights. The Iewes lost not by Aarons Bells their Hopes: And what lose we by Miters Sight, or Copes? Thus stands our Church beset with Schifmaticks, And Romish Routes pretended Catholiks: The Former raising Jarres for Triviall things, The Latter seemes to taint the New mans Springs. And yet she shines most bright, while like a Storme, The Formers Faction quailes, and may reforme Their slips with Ease, at least, when mellow Age Shall by Degrees compose their Passions Rage. And there is Hope the Other will renounce Dependencies on Saints, and so pronounce: (As did those Saints themselves) Faith Justifies, And Christ his Bloud alone doth us suffice Without our Owne, or other Merits Boast, To gaine Salvation through the Holy Ghost. For want of Tythes the One a Sect contrives: And Discontent tempts Babels Fugitives. Thus hath our Christian Church by Grace Divine, Past through the Seventeenth Age till Thirty Nine, And Sixteen Hundred Yeares from Christ his Birth Are fully told by Mortalls here on Earth; In spight of Tyrants, Schismes, Idolatry, The Dragons Floud, and Babels Butchery. O would my Muse knew wayes to reconcile The stubborne Strayes and Hot-spurs of this Ile, That, as We all extoll One Christian Creed, And what were in Six Hundred Yeares decreed By the First Synods of the East and West, So we might meet at our Communion Feast In mutuall Love, without distrust or stings, To pay our Vowes unto the King of Kings, Like Brethren with Harmonious Ravishment In Spirit, with One Will, and One Consent. Accounting Copes, Bells, Organs, Surplices, Or shaven Crownes, as Rites, not Substances To barre the Faith or Conscience of a Saint, As Some with such Conceits the Church would taint. “A Christian should be mild in Temporall Things, “Which breeds not Sin, nor Soul-sick Scandall brings. “So that Gods Word be preacht and Faith encrease, “I will accept what Outward Garbes they please. “Ile kneele, sit, stand, or else in Sack-cloth Fast; “So that I may win Soules, no Flesh Ile taste “Ile weare the Sainte Robe, Saint Benets Hood, “Or Friers Cowle, to doe our Weaklings good. “Such shapes I take for harmelesse Policie, “As Adiaphors with Indifferency “Expedient for some Persons more then Other, “So to shake hands, and wrangling Quillets smother; Not like Old Friers of corrupted Zeale, Who rackt sometime the Romish Common-weale, And wanting Wit to chuse Frize, Black, or Gray, Or White, at last they made a Bloudy Fray. About such Outward Formes the Fiend of late With Bloudy Broiles thought to enwrap our State, But He, that left at his Departure hence Against Hell Plot a Gods Spirit for Defence, Inspir'd our King with Mercy, to forgive Them for whose Faults he more then they did grieve. When Some for Fame, and Others for their Hire, When some for Spoiles glad of Combustions Fire, And some for Doubts with swelling Spleen did hope In Savage Fight with Martiall Troupes to cope: Our Charles, though strongly Arm'd extended there In Christian Love Grace unto Erring Men, Like Him, who rather chose One Citizen To save then Stay a Thousand Hostile Men. By this rare Act of sacred Clemencie He paralells, nay, gets Precedencie Above all Kings that sway this Worldly Spheare, Whose Subjects more their Frownes and Rigour feare Then honour them for Ballanc'd Equity, Or Reall Deedes surmounting Quality. Had Theodosius so his Passions squar'd, He surely had the Thessalonians spar'd, And not been warn'd by Ambrose to refraine Fr? Millains Church, til conscience wrought some Pain O Happy Prince, that knew'st thy Saviours Will! O Happy Land where Soveraigns feare to Kill! Now, yee that vaunt of Albions Albanact, Or of Fergusius Sway, applaud this Act With thankfull Layes set forth in Charles his praise, VVho when he might destroy forgave your Strayes. But O what dolefull Newes borre in my Eares? That Discords Flame, late quencht, againe appeares? VVe shall, they say, Have Warres, and bloudy warres New Musters, Taxes, Toile. Our Wizzards starres, And Malt-Worme Braines inculcate like Bug-beares, In Luke-warme Breasts effeminated Feares. My Censure now of our late Vulgars Bruit, Who blinded in their Owne would seeme acute In Heavens Affaires, is this: that if Our God Smite them or us, who can resist his Rod? Some Ranke of Ease require Phlebotomy: Some Craz'd: Some Leane, like an Anoatmy: Their Sinnes are great, and we excuse not Our. Our Feasts, Rich Robes, Law-suites, and Humors store Bloud-letting need, and purge of Hellebore. But, if as oft as Men offend, God powre The Vialls of his Wrath and Vengeance downe, Who now had liv'd to have his Mercies knowne? Whether we dye at Sea, or on the Land By Famine, Plagues, or Blowes from Butchers hand, That Three-string'd Whip, which doth us here attend For Temporall Revenge, or Trialls End, Gods Will be done. Yet whilst his Church on Earth Stands firme, I feare no Wars, no Plague nor Dearth: For Worldly things (so Fates have weav'd the Plot) Rowle, reele, and squierme like Eeles within a Pot. How shall we then weare out these Worldly Broiles? So voluble of Course, so full of Toiles? Just as some dealt with a tumultuous Crew Of Leaguer'd Goats. When first the Quarrell grew, And Shepheards met with mind to trounce them all, A Swaine did thus their sodaine Doome recall: What shall we doe with these bold Animalls: Which pill our Plants, and spoile our Vegetalls? Which gathering into Whoords care not for words? Nor with their Valiant Tupper doe feare our Swords. As if they would out-bear'd, they threaten us, That Cats enrag'd may turne as perilous As greater Beasts. So me thinke them to immure, Lest other Beasts to Follies they inure. They Custome claime, and Native Liberties, To pill our Bark, and bronze on Grafts of price, But what bald Custome can their Bucks inferre (Not in their Rutting time, for then to erre VVas Frenzies Fit) the Peace to violate? With Skreames to scare our Mellbœan State, VVhen Prudent Pan with Countenance severe Assay'd by Law the Mutineers to feare? What shall we doe with this long bearded Kind Of Catrell, which presume to rend the Rind And Beauty of our Woods without controule? Slighting our Writs like a vain Blank or Scrowle? These Out-rages are great. Yet Policie With Pitty mixt warnes our Vicegerency Over Gods Creatures to provide some Course, That Beasts of Gaine may thrive, nor fare the worse. Fire and Blood-letting are the last of Cures: So, to be Mild hurts not, but us secures; And though it seemes a while, like to a Block Contemn'd of Frogs, yet lasts it like the Rock. The Oxe must not be muzzled, not these Goates Depriv'd of Food, nor Horses rob'd of Oates. What Forrests are reserv'd for straggling Deere, Which retribute small Profit in the Yeare? We foster greedy Hounds and swilling Swine: And shall we now lesse hurtfull Beasts confine? What Cares take we for Drones more then for Bees? And yet to Kiddes grutch a few Sapling Trees? If we hemme in their Dammes, Both dye of Dearth, And so we lose some of the Best on Earth For Profits Breed. They rough and hardy are In Aires Extremes, content with simple Fare: (A Gift which many Beasts, nay men do want, A Gift which lessens Crimes exorbitant.) A little them sustaines. And yet their Does Yeeld store of Milk to countervaile some Cowes. They doe bring forth two or three Kiddes a piece Within the Yeare; their Milk doth cordialize, Natur'd like what they eate. Feed them with Spurge Or Lettice, then their Milk doth Humours purge. The Male-Goats Bloud refines the Diamond; It breakes the Stone, and makes the Gravell'd sound. When it is bakt, or into Powder done, And strew'd on Liquid Food, it Cures the Stone Sooner then Leeks, or Alisanders Broth, Which seemes with it compar'd but skummy Froth. A Hivers Pasty tasts like Venison; The Buffe defends from Frost as from the Sunne. I skip the Stuffe wrought of Goats stately Beard, Lest not a Goats-haires worth be what I heard; Nor mention I Borrachoes Spanish Case, Which Pilgrims vow with Healths to Bacchus Grace; Nor yet their Flesh, which Portingalls do dresse And lay with Salt for Indiaes Voyages. So usefull are these Goats, that none for want Of them in wild and New-found Lands can plant: Which is the Cause that Brittaines Colonies Thrive not there like the Spaniards Progenies. Now for my Vote or Cloze particulare, Which I submit to your more Silver Haire: It is not safe the moody to constraine; Tread on a Worme, and it will turne againe. The Fits o're-past: we may cull out the Bad, Divide their Troupes, and Cure in time the Mad. If we permit the Weanelings of their Flocks, Their tender Kiddes, which cannot shift on Rocks For stronger Food, to champ on weaker Boughes; And their Moone-sick on Plants sometimes to brouze: Both these will, when their Constitution growes To abler Nerves, eat Hay in time of Snowes, And be right glad to taste of stronger Food Aswell to our Content, as for their Good. And let the rest live in their Craggy Soile, In hope they will no more keepe revell Coile; Lest if we thence provoke their Wilder Whelpes, They may turne mad with Tupping and with Yelpes, Unlesse in the Mid-Summers Moone we chaine Those whom we finde most Crazed in the Braine. 'Twere well we could their Teeth with safety file, And not our hands with Streames of Bloud defile If they disband, and of their Crimes repent, And will with Griefe redeeme their Punishment, Let's suffer them to spend their windy Breath Upon the Rocky Hills and Barren Heath, That it may be ingross'd in After-Rowles: We left them there, where bustling Boreas cooles The hottest Spleen, in hope that they would grow More usefull farre then we doe finde them now. When Riper Time shall Humours purifie, They will conforme themselves, at least their Fry. Since Forraigne Coasts to Beares &amp; Wolves submit, I thinke we may lesse harmefull Goats admit To their Old Haunts our Daisies to encrease, So that henceforth their Buckes from Tupping cease. Let us not then root out these Beasts with Beards, Weakning our Stock (an Honour to our Heards) Lest we give Cause of Jeering to our Foes, Who, if our Stock decayes, may worke us woes. They pill our Barke: that's it you now will say; So did our Iron-men and Tanners play: So Others have by causelesse Brawles and Fees, And Heathnish Spoiles, forc'd men to sell good Trees. But here one whisperd him: Touch not that Noat, Lest you be term'd a rash-promoting Goat, Incurring Scorne with hobbubs and out-cries, For glancing at our Modernes Robberies. The Swaine abash'd, his Face to Crimson did; And the Goats Cause lies in suspense untri'd: Where though Great Pan an Higher skill relies, Yet scornes he not a Rusticks poore Supplies, In all Extreames on this I set my Rest. Of Ills to abuse the Least, of Good the Best, And if I misse the Latter to attaine, Yet I will hope the Golden Meane to gaine. Concerning other Points of Faiths abuse, As Furgatories Paine, false Idolls use, Courting of Saints, to Christs apparant wrong, Gods Sacred Word kept from the Vulgar Tongue, Additions to the Masse, the Papall Keyes, And Priests debarr'd of Wives: Let him that waighes The Dreames of Balaams Priests, this Passage know: Pride made the Pope a Simon Magus grow, And then he chang'd the Spirits Gifts for Gaine. For after the Decease of Charlemaine, Who Sceptred Popes, in the ensuing Yeares, They to maintaine their Pomp, the Christian Meeres Of Modesty transcended, got elbow roome To spread the Divels Huskes in rampant Rome. Which to reforme, as we of late have done In Brittaines Orbe, by Wickliffs Cares begun About three Ages past, so let all them, Who hope to see the New Ierusalem, Looke backe upon the first Sixe Centuries; Or if that seeme too tedious to revise, Let them the next Sixe Ages well review, And they shall finde Romes Faith then patcht anew, That by Degrees the Popes by Phocas first, And by Great Charles since rais'd, became accurst; And that Our Church the very same of Old, Which was at Nice, and Chalcedon enroll'd For Orthodoxe, is Catholick and True; Onely, because new-scour'd, enstiled New. Lo here, Deare Countrey-men, in Pithy Phraze, What some have whirl'd about with winding Maze, And some, I hope, these short Analyses, Will rellish more then long Remonstrances, Since Substances yee like, I simply shew Where lay our Church Pure, Catholick and True, Before we tooke the Name of Protestants At Auspurg late; which Our Extravagants By Transmarine and false exotick Glosse Would soile, like Pitch, with Appellations grosse Of Huguenots, or Luthers Hereticks; While they usurpe the Name of Catholicks, Like Hagars Brood, which Moores terme Saracen; Like Hypocrites, who passe for Godly Men. For why should they alone be in our West Call'd Catholicks, when Thousands in the East, The Abissines and Others doe contend For the like Name in Substance, Use, and End? Why should the Parts above the Whole presume? One Sister Church the Mothers Stile assume? The Catholick, which spreads in every Coast With Mutuall Gifts powr'd by the Holy Ghost? Why should the Beames against the Sunne compact? The Branches from the Oakes Good Name detract? Our Churches are (waigh the Comparison) As Boughes or Beames: Christs Spouse the Oak or Sun. And for Our Church, more yet I could relate, To manifest her Wane, Eclipse, and Fate In Popish Times, but that each Novice knowes What meanes the Desert, where she powr'd her vowes During the Raigne of that great Mystick Whore, Which preacht False Christs by the red Dragons Lore. But mauger Constance, Trent, and Lateran, The Night is past of Skreeching Ignorance, And we embrace the Spirits Countenance, Which at this day shines bright in Brittaines Ile, And may doe long, if we shun Hate and Guile. Not Ecchius, Moore, Poole, Fisher, Posse vine, Not Dowayes Fry, nor Copious Bellarmine Can match our Calvin, Zanchius, Bullinger, Frith, Jewell, Foxe, Fulkes, Raynolds, Whitaker, Andrewes, Usher, and those whose Melodies Mount up to Christ, like a New Sacrifice, With many moe in our Great Brittaines Orbe, Surviving yet, and able them to curbe: Whose Praises Web more Curious if I spun, I should then light a Candle in the Sunne; Or undertake Saint Michaels Warre to pen, A Taske more fit for Angels then for Men. Yet by that Mystick Type Saints may discry The Battels Issue, and our Victory: For such a Palme the Fiery Crosses Signe Hath gain'd, as in the Dayes of Constantine. But now in Embers clozing up my Fire, I silently into my Thoughts retire, Oft looking backe to Babels Mystery, Oft musing on Faire Sions Victory, Where first Six Hundred Sixty Six I fixe, One Thousand then Six Hundred Fifty Sixe, Times Pedegree from Mans Creation cast, Till Fatall Showres for Sinne the Earth defac't, I ruminate in Mind, least sodainly While I deferre my Duty to supply, The last great Trumpets Sound concludes the Day To Worldlings woe, and Sinners sore Dismay. Warres in Faiths House proclaim'd, and Babylon Discover'd shew great Doomes-dayes signs neer gone: From which Extreames, Lord, save our Church aswell As thou Elias didst from Iezabel, That with the Spirits streame she quench her Thirst Untill that Day, while Babel lies accurst. As long as Sun and Moone, or Raine-bowes signe Shall last, preserve our King like Constantine, Assigning us from Stewarts Regall Ligne Good Stwards still to over-see what's Thine. Remove not hence our Churches Candlestick, While firmely we to Thy Sonnes Pledges stick, But for his Sake who paid the Costly Price In Judgement due for our Enormities, Whereas some led by Fiends as yet do stray, If they Repent, reduce them to thy way, That Ismaels Brood henceforth no Christians flout For Lutherans, or the Wicklevian Rout, For Huguenots, Novatians, Schismaticks, For Puritans, or Mungrell Catholicks. When these with Peter vouch Gods Living Sonne, With Paul One God, One Advocate alone Exploding School-mens Dreames, Hypocrisies, Soules-Marchandize, and winding Fallacies, We then shall soone for Other Points agree, Without recourse to Edens curious Tree. This Fruit the Church reapes by her Childrens Peace: When they from jarres, then Foes from jeering cease. THE PICTVRE OF THE TRVE CATHOLICK AND APOSTOLICK CHURCH Represented in English and Latine Numbers. The Argument. The Authour last this Corollary knits, To help Our Church against mad wrangling Wits: Till the Sixth Age the Spouse of Christ shone Pure; So doth our Church. And here's her Portraiture. The Spouse of Christ shone in her Prime When she liv'd neere th' Apostles Time, But afterwards Ecclips'd of Light, She lay Obscure from most mens Sight: For while her Watch hugg'd Carnall Ease, And loath'd the Crosse, she felt Disease. Because they did Gods Rayes contemne, And Maumets serv'd, Grace fled from them. Then Starres fell downe, Fiends blackt the Aire, And Mungrells held the Churches Chaire. But now dispelling Errours Night, By Christ his Might, our New-mans Light, She may compare for Faith alike With famous Romes first Catholick, And Paragons for Vertue bright The Royall Scribes sweet Sulamite, Who train'd to Zeale, yet without Traps, Her poore Young Sister wanting Paps; Without Traditions she train'd her, Or Quillets, which make Soules to Erre. So feedes our Church her Tender Brood With Milk, the Strong with stronger Food. She doth contend in Grace to thrive, Reformed, like the Primitive. She hates the Darke, yet walkes the Round, And joyes to heare the Gospels Sound. She hates their Mind in Judgement blind, Who swell with Merits out of kind. In Christ alone lies all her Hope, Not craving Help of Saint or Pope. Poore Saints, to shew her Faith by Deedes, She fills their Soules, their Bodies feedes. She grants no Weapons for Offence; Save Vowes and Fasting for Defence; And yet she strikes. But with what Sword? The Spirits Sword, Gods Lightning Word. Indiff'rent Toyes, and Childish Slips She slights, but checks grosse Sinnes with stripes. Yet soone the Strayes her Favour winne, When they Repent them of the Sinne, So mild is she, still loathing Ill, And yet most loath the Soule to kill. Such is the Lady, whom I serve; Her Goodnesse such, whom I observe, And for whosee Love I beg'd these Layes Borne from the Spheares with Flaming Rayes. But who can paint the Dowries forth Of this New Mary to the Worth? O let us for her Gifts restor'd Then Sacrifice to Heavens Lord Our Hearts with Psalmes, like Trumpets lowd, For sending her to curbe the Proud, And to beare downe Romes Antichrist, As she types her that brought forth Christ, The Object of our Second Birth, And the Prime cause of all our Mirth. Thus is Our Church in Essence like The Ancient True Apostolick. God grant this Dame, our Brittaines long to sway, Whereby they may to Christ new Vowes repay; And blesse thee, Reader, with like Happinesse, To hold his pledges firme with Godlinesse. Another Hymne to the same Effect, as how to discerne the True Catholick Church. The Crosse, on which our Saviour di'd, For many Yeares lay undiscri'd With Rubbage soil'd in Calvary, Till, to renew Christs Memory, The Mother of Great Constantine Searcht, found, and left it for a Signe, That Converts then might understand, Christ di'd for them in Jewries Land. In the like sort the Church of Christ, Lay long Eclips'd through Carnall Mist, Resembling Gold obscur'd with drosse, As was with Earth that Woodden Crosse. And though some wisht to find her out, They could not bring their wish about, (So strong of Might, so full of sleight Was Babels Whore to bleare their Sight) Untill Gods Word perform'd the Deed With Martyrs Bloud, the Churches Seed; Till Wickliffe first, and Luther next Stept up, her Babes stood sore perplext. Now (O looke up) this Gracious Queene On Sions Hill is to be seene, With her New man, Gods hopefull Sonne, Rayes darting like the Glorious Sunne. But they, who would descry her right, Must her descry with Inward Sight, Not like the Old Brasse-Serpent, which Idolaters did earst bewich, But like the Crosse, which Saints took up Ere Some to that since found did stoup. Thus stands the Church seen and unseen, Unseen of Sots, of Saints well seen. These by Gods Word her Presence waigh, Those by false Dreames and Worldly Sway. Now, Brother, mark, which of these Crew Of Christ his Church are Children true? The One kneele to the New mans Rock, The Other to an Outward Stock, Like Manichees, which they doe paint For Angellick, or Guardian Saint. There, they meet men, who live by Lurch, But never Saints of the True Church. THE CONCLVSION TO THE READERS. The Argument. The Authour here from the New-man derives The Churches Web, condemnes the Dronish Hives, Blames Labans Saints, and false Poetick Dreames, Which he reformes, and so concludes his Theames. I blunder forth no Quirkes, nor Captious Theames, No triviall Toyes, nor fond Lascivious Dreames. While Carnall Wits were pleas'd to weave such Tales, Of late I found the New-mans Wormes in Wales, Whose Entrailes spun in my retired Home For me some Silk, which suits with Englands Loome, Without engagement to a Forraigne Shore, For Flaunders, Romes, or the Hesperian Love. And now my Silk-wormes store Domestick spun I have divulg'd before the Fates have run Their Period out for my poore Threed of Life, Before strong Passions wave my Thoughts with strife, My Sences with more Griefe, or what might let The serious Task which Christ on me had set. Though Hydraes hiss'd, and Mammons Asses bray'd, Yet could not all their Coile make me affray'd, Nor daunt my Free-borne Muse from setting forth To publick view some usefull wares of worth; Nor could Romes Canons Noise roar'd out from Trent Deterre my Zeale, nor fear my faire intent; Where they have doom'd the Books of Protestants, The New-mans Fruit, for wild Extravagants. Such Panick Goblin Feares I leave to them, Who slighting Truth the Spirits Rayes contemne. Not tempting Wine, nor Feasts delicious Bait Could make me sound a Cowards base retrait; Nor could the Stormes of our late Adverse Times Disturbe, or shake my Forme of Sacred Rimes, Where I have limm'd in a two-folded Frame Our Saviours Life, and his True Churches Flame, Whereof the Latter here I first produce To usher that of the Divinest Use. No pamper'd Sloth, nor Housholds netled Care, Nor Natures Nets could my Resolves ensnare To hide from you her Tents, and War-fares Wayes From Christs Ascent untill our present Dayes, But that I would to yeeld you some Content, Strow her good Tents with Leaves of Rosy scent, And to recure the Saulish Moone-sick Braine, I would enchant the Sence with Musicks Straine. I lock not up my Use of Labour'd Houres, Nor poast it o're unto Executours, Like Miser-Churles, who worldly Goods conceale, And wrong thereby the Christian Common-weale, Who at their death the same most madly leave To such as may their hoped Trust deceave. The Authour dead: who cares to mend his Bookes? No Step-Dame well to Orphans Breeding lookes. No Nurse respects a tender Suckling Wight Like Her, who claimes the Native proper Right, As Iudaes wisest King long since descri'd, When he gave Doome on the True Mothers Side. Unhappy are those Scribes, who catch no Soules For Christ, if so they may, by Holy Scroules; And much too blame are those of Carnall Brood, Who loath to taste of Intellectuall Food, Yet surfeit on Old Tales of Robin Hood, Of Friers Cowles, or of Saint Benets Hood, Of Patricks Broiles, or of Saint Georges Launce, Of Errant Knights, or of the Fairy Daunce. But Yee, who are borne of Immortall Seed, Scorne your Best Part with Honey'd Gall to feed. Fly, Readers, fly, and shunne such Baites as these, Which though they for a time the Sences please, At last they breed a Soule-sick ravery, Which will from Truth distast your Memory. Fly from such Cates, which shining Sinnes suggest, And from their Sauce, though by a Prophet drest, Like that, which on the way the Man of God From Bethel tooke, although by him forbod. Read vertuous Bookes, which Manners rectifie, And may help up the Soule to edifie; For even as the Spirits cleere and fresh Excell in worth the massy Pulpe of Flesh: Much more essentiall Joy and true Delight, We must conceive, spring from the New-mans Light, Where we by Grace may hap to be like Paul In Spirit rapt above this Earthly Ball, To Paradise, or the Third Heaven, where He learn'd more Newes then he away could beare. O doe not then the Spirits Gifts suppresse, Since they beare up the Soule, beat down the Flesh. They mount the Soule above the Christalline And Starry Orbes to view with Sight Divine Those Mysteries, for which the Greatest Clark, Unlesse sometimes he stoupes, gropes in the Dark, And never shall atteine to that brave Pitch, Because his wings are soil'd with clammy Pitch, Or borrow'd of the Peacocks stately Traine, Which either lead him to Despaire and Baine, Or to Presumptuous sinne, like Lucifers, And then, as Lampes, false Meteours he preferres Before the Light of Gods, Eternall Word; And the Soules Banquet at his Sacred Boord. Then, Humane shrines, and Monks Mythology He more besaints then true Theology. For as the Greeks Plurality of Gods Devis'd, whom they confest to live at ods Among themselves: so Superstition since Crept in among the Robes, as at a pinch, To further Hells Dominion like to fall, When Romes Great Empire won'd, if sugred Gall Had not been mixt with Faithes Restorative By Satans Craft, to taint the Primitive With Calendars of Canonized Saints, To whom they fram'd instead of Christ Complaints, As in Old time those Poets did approve The Lesser Gods, as Advocates to Iove. And by the like Distinctions in the Schooles VVould them Create Subordinated Fooles, Or Courtiers of th' Olympian Majesty To intercede, or ayd Mortality. To which they kneel'd in various Idol-shapes, Like Babels Head of Gold, Calves, Cars, or Apes. So Babels babling Dawes Saints Help exact: Saint Margaret Lucinaes Part must Act, Saint Anthony relieves them of the Pox With Reliques Charmes fetcht from Old Baldems Box. For the Twin-Brother Gods they consecrate Saint Nicholas at Sea their Advocate: Saint Eustace must uphold the Forrest Game, For which Old Pagans us'd Dianaes Name. VVith a huge Club Saint Christopher they please, As with the like those painted Hercules. Yea, every Soile possessed Teutelares, Small Gods, to ease them of their heavy Cares. Iuno holp Carthage, Mars Rome, Pallas Greece, Ceres blest Corne, Pan sheep, Pomona Trees, So Denis France, George England, Iago Spaine, And the like Saints to guard their Coast they faigne, The Scottish Folkes were of Saint Andrewes ward, Ireland of Patricks, Wales of Davids Guard. Unto Saint Mark the Rich Venetian bends, And he that Venice wrongs with Mark contends. But above all Saint Peter beares the Bell: He Rome protects, and Rome must all excell. Numaes Ægeria Peter hath supprest, VVith Romulus Saint Peter doth contest. Nay, Peters Keyes the Eagle bruiz'd, but mist Ianus his Peacefull Do ores to shut for Christ. But we, which are of Gods Spirit borne Lament to see Christs seamelesse Rayment torne, Or parted from the Fashion Primitive, But joine, like Saints, in Sacred Love to thrive. We fly veine Dreames, which oft enchant the Sence From worshipping the God-heads Excellence. We slight the Tales of Poets-ranke Vagaries, As Vowes to Saints with needlesse Ave-Maries. While Others steale to Paths unknowne, or stray To Stranger Coasts, we goe the surest way For feare of Wolves, or what may else betide A man that loseth Christ, his Chiefest Guide. While some in Tongue unknowne, like Parrats, chat, And aske of God by roat they know not what: Our Churches Babes doe pray in Christ his Name For what they want, and He doth grant the same For his deare sake, who pleades for Humane Race, While they with understanding crave his Grace; And having gain'd their Suit they sing his Praise With cheerfull hearts, new Tongues, &amp; thankful Layes: Not grounding Faith on Saints Pluralities On Angels, Pow'res, or Principalities. As for the Garbes of Poets Antick Fables, They are but vaine, though Moralized Bables, Vaine like themselves, who pip'd for Hire, or Fame, While Saints of Zeale set out their Makers Name. So David rapt with Blisse compos'd his Layes: But Horace broacht for need Mæcenaes Praise. So Ieremy Ierusalems Annoy Bewail'd of Zeale; when Homer beg'd for Troy. Our Straines therefore sprung from Celestiall Light Shal Scurrile Songs scourge hence, like works of night; Our Truth shall foile their Dreames, our Substances Their Apes, our Faith their Heathnish Consciences. And in their stead, to help Devotions Heat, Our New man here cookes various sorts of Meat, VVith Musick apt thy Spirits to refresh, If thou suppresse the Motions of the Flesh. Our Adam first shall hurle Prometheus downe; Then, Noes Floud shall their Deucalions drowne, With Titans Brood, whom they for Giants hatch; And Babels Towre will Pelions Mount o're-match. By Hemors Sonne our gadding Dinaes Rape Doth unto Sires a faire Example shape What foule Effects by Cock'ring Love ensue, Since Indulgence both Parties then did rue; More true then Helens Rape, by Theseus first, And last by Paris of old Trojans curst. Our Moses shall convince their faign'd mistakes, As did his Rod th' Ægyptians charmed Snakes. For Niobe into a Stone estrang'd, We sounds Lots Wife to a Salt-Pillar chang'd. For Ioves descent to be Philemons Guest, Our Abram for Three Angels made a Feast; And for the Formers Gift from Iupiter, Our Solomon did Wisdomes choise preferre. Our Sampson with the Jaw-bone of an Asse, Doth Hercules and his Twelve Labours passe. Our Iepthes vow for his Maid-Child too grim, Doth the Grek Prince his Iphigenia dim. Our zealous Davids Sling doth farre exceed Their Perseus Shield, and Ariadnes Threed. If Hylas they and Hercules object: Or Theseus and Pirithous Loves select; Our David lov'd his Ionathan more deare, As may yet by his Epitaph appeare. If they fetch Rites from Babel, Rome, or Creet: Gods Lawes from Sinai we and Salem greet. If Midas they with Asses Eares bewray: We Humane Speech in Balaams Asse display. If they gaze on the Coach of Phœbus Sonne, We Iosuah sing Commander of the Sunne; Ot else we can the Sunnes Degrees produce, Backward to goe for Hezechiaes use. But while they lift the Creatures Excellence, We glory bring to our Creatour thence. Thence we derive a Subject to commend Gods Friendship showne to Man as to his Friend. If they tune Odes in Æsculapius praise, Because from Death He Theseus Sonne did raise: From Holy Writ we many can transferre, Who really to Life restored were. If they insist on Delphica Oracles; True Prophesies confirm'd with Miracles We can from Gods choise Servants more rehearse, Then may be coucht, or sung in stinted Verse. And if they chaunt Loves Rapes by Carnall Jove: We Canticles sing of Divinest Love: And with our Vowes prevent Asmodeus Craft, Mauger Loves Golden Wings and Poisned Shaft. Let Halcion grieve for Ceix her Husbands death, Till fabled for a Bird Sobs stop her Breath: We for slaine Bethlems Babes count Rachels Teares. Or the sad Badge we sing, which Salem weares? Or else our Churches Threnes for her late Losse Of Christian Bloud spilt causelesse at the Crosse. Whilst that they bath in Aganippes Spring, Of Jordan we and of Bethesda sing. And while they climbe Parnassus forked Hill, On Sions Mount we shew our sacred skill. Instead of Pagan Baites with Calvary, And Olives Fruit we sauce our Poetry According to Christs Gifts infused new, We leave those Dregges, which the Old man did brew. As Oracles ceas'd after Christ his Death Among the Gentiles by the Apostles Breath: So faile those Lees, which Satan since did brew, By our Religion, of some termed New. So that for their false Metamorphosis Of men to Earthly Formes, our Purpose is, Soules to convert into Immortall shapes By our New man, that foiles their Apes and Rapes. And for that Dame Ephesian Idoliz'd, We Christ his Mother-Maid Evangeliz'd. Doe blesse and praise, but worship not of late As Goddesse, least from God we derogate. For Hermes, Pallas, or Apolloes Lore, We crave the Holy Ghost to blesse our store, For Tantalus in Hell, or Ixions Wheele, We Dives Preach their racking gaine to feele. Soules Iudges they serv'd Minos, Rhadamant, And Æacus: But Christ our Iudge we chant, Christ we looke for to Doome both Deal and Quick, The Dead in Faith and the Church Catholick: Meane while his Spirit raignes in every Place, Yet craves as Man for men his Fathers Grace. With this Prime Saint we satisfie our selves, And for him scorne all Shrines, and Labans Elves; Whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, One God in Three, we sound through Brittains Coast, As we were bound at our New Second Birth, Gods Angels all applauding us with Mirth. Now, Eies, pack hence, whether Elizian Greece, Th' Hesperides yee faigne, or Colchos Fleece: Whether yee gull weake Soules, or them controule With Benets Hood, or the Franciscans Cowle; Whether yee slow spring Pooles Poeticall, From Tophets Lake, or Streames Papisticall; And Farewell Dreames, whether from Chollers steame, From Dragons Gull yee flow, or Bloud and Fleame. And in their stead, come Truth, thy Name we blaze, For thy Bright Lampe doth Men and Fiends amaze, Thou art the Life of a True Prophets Song, And they who slight thy Sound, Gods Spirit wrong. Then come, O Blessed Truth, Correct our Ods, As thou long since hast quail'd the Pagans Gods; And suffer not the Dragons Sorceries To be commixt with Christian Mysteries, Nor Legends of vaine Men to prejudice The Gospels Light, or Our New Sacrifice. On thee I built the Churches History; By thee I found, that Babels Mystery Eclips'd the Church from the seventh Century, Till Wickliffe did into Romes Whoredomes pry, And by his Pen that Subject more dilate, Which Thousands now as copiously relate, Which I among the rest, as they began, Have warbled forth to daunt the Outward man, Who by Nick-names doth taxe Our Church for New, And to her Spouse out-face to be untrue. Now to wind up my Task, I adde this Ode, In hope no Saint will my intent explode: Lest I the Doome of Wrath encurre, Which Slugges doth for bad Stewards blurre, I looke about with watchfull Cares To see who wants some Holy Wares. My Talents use I freely give To cloath some Soules, whilst yet I live. Divide the Web, Friends, as yee please; The Weare is light producing Ease. The Hew not gaudy, nor yet base, But like White Robes, which Temples grace, From Our New man I fetcht the Stuffe, Let none then take the Gift in Snuffe, Or taxe the Matter for the Forme, Since what I could I did performe. They came from Love, the Spirits Dove, Let that suffice Good Mindes to move. FINIS.</field>
