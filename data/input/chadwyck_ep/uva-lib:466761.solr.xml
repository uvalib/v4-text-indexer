      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST NOBLE Algernon, DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND, K. G. &amp; &amp; &amp;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MAID OF TWEED. Blithe I left yon southern river, Every glen and painted mead, Joyousâthinking ne'er to severâ Sought the lovely maid of Tweed. Purest flames of love were burning; Hope proclaimed the hour returning, When pleasure should succeed to mourning, As I sought the maid of Tweed! Light the clouds of Eve reposing Varied scarce the sky's soft blue; And the sun, his bright eye closing, O'er the land his last beams threw. High appeared the fair-one's towers, Green I saw her warbling bowers, Where had often flown the hours As I sung the maid of Tweed. Still the lofty oak-tree flourished Where I'd carved our names before; Theseâhow oft the thought was cherished!â Sadly pleased, she might explore. All in vain!âThough love's still burning, And hope would tell of bliss returning, Pleasure must give place to mourningâ False the lovely maid of Tweed; Yet the haunts where we have wandered, To my breast are fondly dear; Where my brightest years I squandered, Let me mourn my fate severe! By the Tweed's translucent river Pour my song of sorrow ever, Till from my bosom death shall sever The image of the maid of Tweed! THOUGH WINTER'S CHILL BREEZES. Though winter's chill breezes have blighted each flower, And nature is sad in the gloom of the hour, The blithe smile of summer o'er mountain and plain, To garden and grove will bring beauty again. But the Rose that has fallen by Breamish's side, In the glow of its tints, and the height of its pride, What dew shall refreshen? what sunbeam restore? 'Tis vanished from earth, and shall grace it no more! The clouds that envelope the sun in mid course, That sun yet will vanquish, and shine in his force; As dark on my soul are the sorrow-clouds met, But the sun that should chase them, for ever hath set! Farewell! I must mourn thee, a bright vision gone, Of beauty that bloomed, and of virtue that shone; For, though fair among angels, 'tis thine to adore, 'Tis mineâto behold and to clasp thee, no more! MY BLESSING ON BRADFORD. My blessing on Bradford! though smoky it be, No town in broad Yorkshire is dearer to me: It is dear for the Past when full often a guest, I sat at its board with the friends I loved best; When wine made our many Symposia divine, And the kindness was even more prized than the wine. It is dear for the Present; for though I am thrown In this vast and cold desert of brick and of stone, With leagues interposed between Bradford and meâ If a hundred old friends from the country I see, Be sure of that hundred (most ask me to dine!) The noble Bradfordians make ninety and nine! Then can I but love it? though dark be its wreath, I know what is warming and shining beneath; Its Genius to me is a gloom-chasing spell, And the light of its Friendships doth darkness dispel. FORGIVE ME, O MY NATIVE HILLS! 1856. [Written after visiting Alnwick Castle.] Forgive me, O my native hills, Whose breezes fan my brow; And O my native streams and rills, Forgive your Minstrel now! A spell is working in my brain And overpowers your own, Which fails to wake, or bring again, Emotions dead, or flown. I do not in each lone place kneel, As Iâaforetimeâknelt; I cannot gaze, I cannot feel, As then I gazed and felt. On all your well-known forms I glance, Which yet I hardly view; For still comes one sweet countenance Between my eyes and you! It beams from Lanton's grassy hill, It glances from the Glen, And in the Beaumont's mirror still It fades, and comes again! 'Tis in yon mist, which Newton Torr Now lowers, now updraws, And lo! the mist is mist no moreâ But Beauty's veil of gauze! Forgive me! Ye are still my pride, Your charms I still prefer; But now my soul will not divide The worship due to Her, Who charms by condescension, yet Ne'er seems to condescend; In whom are all the graces met, And all the virtues blend; Who in her halls, but yesterday, Received your humble bard, And deigned some words of praise to say, Each wordâa life's reward! OUR SAXON FATHERS! 1858. Our Saxon fathers built a bridge With piers and arches massive, Which now hath stood for many a year To flow and flood impassive. From every treacherous inland foe, From every bold sea-rover, It was their pride and boast to guard The bridge that bore them over. The Norman clutched it; but the pride Our sires had learned to cherish, Disdained submission, and they swore To win it back or perish. They met in arms at Runnymede, Prepared to stain the clover, Had not the tyrant yielded up The bridge that bore them over. The Stuart seized it for himself, And from the people blocked it; He on the centre placed a gate, And trebly barred and locked it. The people rose. A thunder-cloud Seemed o'er the place to hover, Then burst!âand gate and block had left The bridge that bore them over. Time weareth all. Some rifts may claim A wise examination, A stone decayed may be replaced; Not touched the old foundation! O let us swearâhand locked in hand From John o'Groat's to Doverâ To keep, 'gainst home and foreign foes, The bridge that bears us over! VERSES. 1858. We come not here all selfishly, From sense of favours shown; For that too independent, we A nobler impulse own. We come to pay such homage here As honest men may pay To one they honour and revere, On this his natal day! To flatter greatness which is based On rank and wealth aloneâ Why, we should feel ourselves disgraced, Although it filled a throne; But when 'tis based on native worth, And shines with native rays, We then were âearthyâof the earth,â If we forbore to praise! And here no flower of song there needs; For all our hearts attest, That but to simply state his deeds, Would be to praise him best. But who, in tracing back the past, Can half his deeds compute, Whose sympathies embrace the vast, And touch the most minute! Whate'er in science and in art Exalts his native land, He cherishes with hand and heartâ Warm heart, and open hand. Where'er song blooms, like vernal shower His patronage distils, Down to the very lowliest flower That decks Northumbrian hills! The sailor, far on ocean's foam, For him bids prayer ascend; The little swimmer, nearer home, Knows well his princely friend. When o'er the coasting vessel's deck Hath burst th' engulphing wave, A beacon to the humblest wreck 'Tis his to shine and save. While his ancestral Towers receive Fresh grandeur from his taste, No poor man's dwelling will he leave To Time's incessant waste. Proud to adornâas who would not?â The home that Hotspur knew, He loves to give the peasant's cot Its meet adornment too. Means all but boundless others boastâ Who boasts, like him, a Mind That studies how his wealth shall most And best befriend mankind? And be his fairer self named hereâ No deed we justly laud He ever does, but she is near, To prompt it, or applaud! Then to his health a bumper fill! And when the glass we raise, We feel that, praise him as we will, We cannot over-praise. And whenâlong hence!âhe quits life's walk, Life's duties nobly done, A far Posterity shall talk Of Good Duke Algernon! BURNS' CENTENARY FESTIVAL, AN ODE. I. What moves fair Scotland? Tell me why Her realm of old renown Hears everywhere one festive cry In country and in town? What stirs her peasantry, that they The long procession crowd? And what hath mixed with their array The high-born and the proud? Wherefore hath Science poured her sons To swell and grace the throng? And Poesy her noblest ones That charm the land with song? Tell me what cause together brings A Nation's wealth and worth? Commemorate they the birth of Kings? No, no! a Peasant's birth! II. A Peasant! born to teach the great That, honoured as they are, There may be found in low estate Menâtheir superiors far; And that while Royalty transmutes Liegemen to lords at will, Nature selects and institutes A Peerage grander still! To teach the patient sons of toil That they have that within, Which makes the Tillers of the soil And all above them, kin; That they are born with rights to scan, And, if need be, to save; That eachâthe leastâis still a Man Whom none dare make a slave; That though the accident of birth A different rank hath given, They have with them a common earth, With them, a common Heaven! âHigh teachings! and exemplified On many a Scottish sward, Where rich and poor, with equal pride, Applaud their Peasant-Bard! III. Not mournfullyâas if his death Were still a recent woeâ We mingle where he first drew breath A hundred years ago; Not mournfully, but joyfully, Exultingly we meetâ Above our heads his âlift sae hie,â His land beneath our feet! Ay, his! for timeâwhate'er beside Its ravage overturnsâ Will leave this land its name of pride, âThe Land of Robert Burns!â His! for your bard was not of those Bright meteorsâbrief as bright; The Light that erst in Ayrshire rose Is an undying Light! 'Tis burning, shining,âshedding still, Where'er its beam extends, A brighter tint on vale and hill Than fairest sunshine lends! His! for the King of Scottish song His Banner here unfurled; And round it nowâas subjectsâthrong The men that move the world! IV. O enviable Triumph! Nor To Scotland now confinedâ The Peasant-Bard, your own no more, Belongs to all mankind! Veiled in the tongue which many a strain To every Scot endears, But which, till Burns began his reign, Was strange to Southern earsâ Veiled in the language of the North, His genius burst its shroud, Like sunshine from the cloud went forthâ The brighter for the cloud! And now his wordsâeach word a rayâ O'er earth their splendours dart, But win their first and easiest way To England's sister heart. His love of right, his hate of wrong, His quenchless freedom-thirst, Which made this bard of burning song Of Freedom's bards the Firstâ His lays on woman fair and pure, Our best gift from above, Which ever will his rank insure, First of the bards of Loveâ Find there congenial feelings rife That burn and bind till death, Where Love is held the soul of life, And Liberty the breath! V. O Triumph dearly purchased! Ye Who garnish now his tomb, Andâpondering on the misery Which closed his early doomâ Are prone to say âIf we had been Existent in his day, We would not, like our sires, have seen The bard so pass away!â More humbly think, nor harshly blame What seems indeed a crimeâ Ye view him in the light of fame, And through the haze of time; Ye care not now the faults to see With which his life was charged, And which a dull malignity Then blackened and enlarged; Nor can ye tell how few of those Who might have sought his weal, Were ever cognizant of woes His Pride would not reveal. Then gently blame, if blame ye must, But, first, inquire with care, Are ye to Living Worth more just Than your forefathers were? Goâif ye slight your gifted ones Till quenched their sacred fires, Goâearn that censure from your sons Ye lavish on your sires! VI. I leave his woes. The Muse's gold Is ever tried by fire; In suffering she is wont to mould Her Masters of the lyre. And who would shun his woes, could he Secure the fruit they boreâ His country's love from sea to sea, And fame for evermore! I leave his faults. To dwell on them Good men will little reck; The brighter that we find the gem, The darker seems the speck. And thousands passâunblamedâfrom sight, Far deeplier stained than He, Whose genius yields, itself, the light By which the stains we see! VII. Nor will I seek, presumptuously, The curtain to updraw Which covers that Eternity No mortal ever saw. But Iâfor oneâwill ne'er believe That his Great Heart which, here, Was formed to grieve with those that grieve, And longed to dry each tear!â Which loved the true, the pure, the good, In cottage or in hall, And sang, in many a glorious mood, The loves and joys of all!â Which hated all things bad and base, All fraud and falsehood spurned, And 'gainst th' Oppressors of his race Its keenest arrows turned!â Which warmly felt, and widely poured, The freeman's, patriot's flame, Till Scotland grew a âhousehold wordâ Extensive as his fame!â I never will believe thatâbeat That Great Heart where it mayâ It beats in aught but bliss complete, In God's eternal day! VIII. O pause!âWe know not what new powers Departed spirits gain, Nor whether with this world of ours Their sympathies remain; But if remembrance do survive The severance from the clay; If feelings, ruling when alive, Retain their wonted sway; If souls have consciousness on high Of things that here take place, And, with invigorated eye, Can dart their glance through space;â Who knows! Our Poet now may bend His eye on scenes like this, And Scotia's gathered homage lend A heart-swell e'en in bliss! THAT BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT! 1860. âThat beautiful thought!â I exclaimed, as I mused Beneath a spring sky, with a moon full and bright, And as a thoughtânew, or if not so, unusedâ Glanced into my soul from the grandeur of Night! âThat beautiful thought!â O! if now I had words Of music to fix it in measure and rhyme,â Like the often-heard, joy-giving song of the birds It might be a pleasure for all coming time! âAs it is, it will lie, like a grain from ripe ears, In the soil of my mind, nor may ever unfold; Or if everâlong hence, in the passage of years,â But whereâAh me!âwhere are the years to the old?â The âAh me!â was a sigh for my life in the wane, Worn to its last round, to re-brighten no moreâ And for the slight chance that aught new in my brain Would e'er find expression in verse, as of yore. For my songs haveâthe most of themânot sprung at once From the fancy or feeling that prompted them first; Which lay stored in my breastâtill in ready response To some impulse of powerâinto numbers it burst. âBut shall this thought perish,â I cried, though to me Come never the mood that would wake it to birth? The something which thinks, shall it e'er cease to be? Or cease to remember its musings on earth? âO! may not I yetâout of clay, out of timeâ Enriched with new language, endowed with new powers, Remember this thought in the fair spirit-clime, And sing it to angels in amaranth-bowers? âAnd O! may not thoughtsânew, and beauteous as newâ Flowing still into song as in life they have flowed, Make my Time's dearest joy my Eternity's tooâ Songâsongâever freshâin the realms of my God!â</field>
