      <field name="fulltext">The Spring. Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost Candies the grasse, or castes an ycie creame Vpon the silver Lake, or Chrystall streame: But the warme Sunne thawes the benummed Earth, And makes it tender, gives a sacred birth To the dead Swallow; wakes in hollow tree The drowzie Cuckow, and the Humble-Bee, Now doe a quire of chirping Minstrels bring In tryumph to the world, the youthfull Spring. The Vallies, hills, and woods, in rich araye, Welcome the comming of the long'd for May. Now all things smile; onely my Love doth lowre: Nor hath the scalding Noon-day-Sunne the power, To melt that marble yee, which still doth hold Her heart congeald, and makes her pittie cold The Oxe which lately did for shelter flie Into the stall, doth now securely lie In open fields; and love no more is made By the fire side; but in the cooler shade, Amyntas now doth with his Cloris sleepe Vnder a Sycamoure, and all things keepe Time with the season, only shee doth carry Iune in her eyes, in her heart Ianuary. To A. L. Perswasions to love. Thinke not cause men flatt'ring say, Y'are fresh as Aprill sweet as May, Bright as is the morning starre, That you are so, or though you are Be not therefore proud, and deeme All men unworthy your esteeme. For being so, you loose the pleasure Of being faire, since that rich treasure Of rare beauty, and sweet feature Was bestow'd on you by nature To be enjoy'd, and 'twere a sinne, There to be scarce, where shee hath bin So prodigall of her best graces; Thus common beauties, and meane faces Shall have more pastime, and enjoy The sport you loose by being coy. Did the thing for which I sue Onely concerne my selfe not you, Were men so fram'd as they alone Reap'd all the pleasure, women none, Then had you reason to be scant; But 'twere a madnesse not to grant That which affords (if you consent) To you the giver, more content Then me the beggar; Oh then bee Kinde to your selfe if not to mee; Starue not your selfe, because you may Thereby make me pine away; Nor let brittle beautie make You your wiser thoughts forsake: For that lovely face will faile, Beautie's sweet, but beautie's fraile; 'Tis sooner past, 'tis sooner done Then Summers raine, or winters Sun: Most fleeting when it is most deare, 'Tis gone while wee but say 'tis here. These curious locks so aptly twind, Whose every haire a soule doth bind, Will change their abroun hue, and grow White, and cold as winters snow. That eye which now is Cupids nest Will proue his grave, and all the rest Will follow; in the cheeke, chin, nose Nor lilly shall be found nor rose. And what will then become of all Those, whom now you servants call? Like swallowes when your summers done, They'le flye and seeke some warmer Sun. Then wisely chuse one to your friend, Whose love may, when your beauties end, Remaine still firme: be provident And thinke before the summers spent Of following winter; like the Ant In plenty hoord for time of scant. Cull out amongst the multitude Of lovers, that seeke to intrude Into your favour, one that may Love for an age, not for a day. One that will quench your youthfull fires, And feed in age your hot desires. For when the stormes of time have mou'd, Waves on that cheeke which was belou'd, When a faire Ladies face is pin'd And yellow spred, where red once shin'd, When beauty youth, and all sweets leave her, Love may returne, but lover never. And old folkes say there are no paynes Like itch of love in aged vaines. Oh love me then, and now begin it, Let us not loose this present minute: For time and age will worke that wrack Which time or age shall ne're call backe. The snake each yeare fresh skin resumes, And Eagles change their aged plumes; The saded Rose each spring, receives A fresh red tincture on her leaves: But if your beauties once decay, You never know a second May. Oh, then be wise, and whilst your season Affords you dayes for sport doe reason; Spend not in vaine your lives short houre, But crop in time your beauties flower: Which will away, and doth together Both bud, and fade, both blow and wither. Lips and Eyes. In Celia's face a question did arise Which were more beautifull, her lips or eyes: We (said the eyes,) send forth those poynted darts Which pierce the hardest adamantine hearts From us (replyd the lips,) proceed those blisses Which louers reape by kind words and sweet kisses. Then wept the eyes, and from their springs did powre Of liquid orientall pearle a shower. Whereat the lips mou'd with delight and pleasure, Through a sweete smile vnlockt their pearlie treasure. And bad love judge, whether did adde more grace: Weeping or smiling pearles to Celia's face. A divine Mistris. In natures peeces still I see Some errour, that might mended bee; Something my wish could still remove, Alter or adde; but my faire love Was fram'd by hands farre more divine; For she hath every beauteous line: Yet I had beene farre happier, Had Nature that made me, made her; Then likenes, might (that love creates) Have made her love what now she hates: Yet I confesse I cannot spare, From her iust shape the smallest haire; Nor need I beg from all the store Of heaven, for her one beautie more: Shee hath too much divinity for mee, You Gods reach her some more humanitie. SONG. A beautifull Mistris. If when the Sun at noone displayes His brighter rayes, Thou but appeare, He then all pale with shame and feare, Quencheth his light, Hides his darke brow, flyes from thy sight, And growes more dimme Compar'd to thee, then starres to him. If thou but show thy face againe, When darkenesse doth at midnight raigne, The darkenesse flyes, and light is hurl'd, Round about the silent world: So as alike thou driu'st away, Both light and darkenesse, night and day. A cruell Mistris Wee read of Kings and Gods that kindly tooke, A pitcher fil'd with water from the brooke; But I have dayly tendred without thankes Rivers of teares that overflow their bankes. A slaughter'd bull will appease angry Iove A horse the Sun, a Lambe the God of love, But shee disdaines the spotlesse sacrifice Of a pure heart that at her altar lyes. Vesta is not displeas'd if her chast vrne Doe with repayred fuell ever burne; But my Saint frownes though to her honour'd name. I consecrate a never dying flame. Th'Assyrian King did none i'th' furnace throw, But those that to his Image did not bow; With bended knees I daily worship her, Yet she consumes her owne Idolater. Of such a Goddesse no times leave record, That burnt the temple where she was ador'd. SONG. Murdring beautie. Ile gaze no more on her bewitching face, Since ruine harbours there in every place: For my enchanted soule alike shee drownes With calmes and tempests of her smiles and frownes, I'le love no more those cruell eyes of hers, Which pleas'd or anger'd still are murderers: For if she dart (like lightning) through the ayre Her beames of wrath; she kils me with despaire. If shee behold me with a pleasing eye, I surfet with excesse of joy, and dye. My mistris commanding me to returne her letters. So grieves th'adventrous Merchant, when he throwes All the long toyld for treasure his ship stowes, Into the angry maine, to save from wrack Himselfe and men, as I grieve to give backe These letters, yet so powerfull is your sway, As if you bid me die I must obey. Goe then blest papers, you shall kisse those hands That gave you freedome, but hold me in bands, Which with a touch did give you life, but I Because I may not touch those hands, must die. Me thinkes, as if they knew they should be sent Home to their native soile from banishment, I see them smile, like dying Saints, that know They are to leave the earth, and tow'rd heaven goe. When you returne, pray tell your Soveraigne And mine, I gave you courteous entertaine; Each line receiv'd a teare, and then a kisse, First bath'd in that, it scap'd vnscorcht from this: I kist it because your hand had been there But 'cause it was not now, I shed a teare. Tell her no length of time nor change of ayre, No crueltie, disdaine, absence, dispaire; No nor her stedfast constancie can deterre, My vastall heart from ever hon'ring her. Though these he powerfull arguments to prove I love in vaine; yet I must ever love; Say, if she frowne when you that word rehearse, Service in prose, is oft call'd love in verse: Then pray her, since I send back on my part Her papers, she will send me back my heart. If she refuse, warne her to come before The God of Love, whom thus I will implore. Trav'ling thy Countries road (great God) I spide By chance this Lady, and walkt by her side From place, to place, fearing no violence, For I was well arm'd, and had made defence In former fights, 'gainst fiercer foes, then shee Did at our first incounter seeme to bee. But going farther, every step reveal'd Some hidden weapon, till that time conceal'd, Seeing those outward armes, I did begin To feare, some greater strength was lodg'd within, Looking into her mind, I might survay An hoast of beauties that in ambush lay; And won the day before they fought the field; For I unable to resist, did yeild. But the insulting tyrant so destroyes My conquer'd mind, my ease, my peace, my joyes, Breaks my sweete sleepes, invades my harmelesse rest, Robs me of all the treasure of my brest, Spares not my heart, nor yet a greater wrong; For having stolne my heart, she binds my tongue. But at the last her melting eyes vnseal'd, My lips, enlarg'd, my tongue, then I reveal'd To her owne eares the story of my harmes Wrought by her vertues, and her beauties charmes; Now heare (Iust judge) an act of savagenesse, When I complaine in hope to find redresse, Shee bends her angry brow, and from her eye, Shootes thousand darts, I then well hop'd to die, But in such soveraigne balme, love dips his shot That though they wound a heart, they kill it not; Shee saw the bloud gush forth from many a wound, Yet fled, and left me bleeding on the ground, Nor sought my cure, nor saw me since: 'tis true Absence, and time, (two cunning Leaches) drew The flesh together, yet sure though the skin Be clos'd without, the wound festers within. Thus hath this cruell Lady, vs'd a true Servant, and subject to her selfe, and you, Nor know I (great Love,) if my life be lent To shew thy mercy or my punishment; Since by the onely Magick of thy Art A lover still may live that wants his heart. If this enditement fright her, so as shee Seeme willing to returne my heart to mee, But cannot find it, (for perhaps it may; Mong'st other trifeling hearts be out oth' way.) If she repent and would make me amends Bid her but send me hers, and we are friends. Secresie protested. Feare not (deare Love) that I'le reveale Those houres of pleasure we two steale; No eye shall see, nor yet the Sun Descry, what thou and I have done; No eare shall heare our love, but wee Silent as the night will bee. The God of love himselfe (whose dart Did first wound mine, and then thy heart) Shall never know, that we can tell What sweets in stolne embraces dwell. This only meanes may find it out, If when I dye, Physicians doubt What caus'd my death, and there to view Of all their judgements which was true, Rip up my heart, Oh then I feare The world will see thy picture there. A prayer to the Wind. Goe thou gentle whispering wind, Beare this sigh; and if thou find Where my cruell faire doth rest, Cast it in her snowie brest, So, enflamed by my desire, It may set her heart a-fire. Those sweet kisses thou shalt gaine, Will reward thee for thy paine: Boldly light upon her lip, There such odours, and thence skip To her bosome; lastly fall Downe, and wander over all: Range about those Ivorie hills, From whose every part distills Amber deaw; there spices grow, There pure streames of Nectar flow; There perfume thy felfe, and bring All those sweets upon thy wing: As thou return'st, change by thy power, Every weed into a flower; Turne each Thistle to a Vine, Make the Bramble Eglantine. For so rich a bootie made, Doe but this, and I am payd. Thou canst with thy powerfull blast, Heat apace, and coole as fast: Thou canst kindle hidden flame, And ag'en destroy the same; Then for pittie, either stir Vp the fire of love in her, That alike both flames may shine, Or else quite extinguish mine. Mediocritie in love rejected. SONG. Give me more love, or more disdaine; The Torrid, or the frozen Zone, Bring equall ease unto my paine; The temperate affords me none: Either extreame, of love, or hate, Is sweeter than a calme estate. Give me a storme; if it be love, Like Danae in that golden showre I swimme in pleasure; if it prove Disdaine, that torrent will devoure My Vulture-hopes; and he's possest Of Heaven, that's but from Hell releast; Then crowne my joyes, or cure my paine; Give me more love, or more disdaine. Good counsel to a young Maid. SONG. Gaze not on thy beauties pride, Tender Maid, in the false tide, That from Lovers eyes doth slide. Let thy faithfull Crystall show, How thy colours come, and goe, Beautie takes a foyle from woe. Love, that in those smooth streames lyes, Vnder pitties faire disguise, Will thy melting heart surprize. Netts, of passion finest thred, Snaring Poems, will be spred, All, to catch thy maiden-head. Then beware, for those that cure Loves disease, themselves endure For reward, a Calenture. Rather let the Lover pine, Then his pale cheeke, should assigne A perpetuall blush to thine. To my Mistris sitting by a Rivers side. AN EDDY. Marke how yond Eddy steales away, From the rude streame into the Bay, There lockt up safe, she doth divorce Her waters from the chanels course, And scornes the Torrent, that did bring Her headlong from her native spring. Now doth she with her new love play, Whilst he runs murmuring away. Marke how she courts the bankes, whilst they As amorously their armes display, T'embrace, and clip her silver waves: See how she strokes their sides, and craves An entrance there, which they deny; Whereat she frownes, threatning to flye Home to her streame, and 'gins to swim Backward, but from the chanels brim, Smiling, returnes into the creeke, With thousand dimples on her cheeke. Be thou this Eddy, and I'le make My breast thy shore, where thou shalt take Secure repose, and never dreame Of the quite forsaken streame: Let him to the wide Ocean hast, There lose his colour, name, and tast; Thou shalt save all, and safe from him, Within these armes for ever swim. SONG. Conquest by flight. Ladyes, flye from Love's smooth tale, Oathes steep'd in teares doe oft prevaile; Griefe is infectious, and the ayre Enflam'd with sighes, will blast the fayre: Then stop your cares, when lovers cry, Lest your selfe weepe, when no soft eye, Shall with a sorrowing teare repay That pittie which you cast away. Young men fly, when beautie darts, Amorous glances at your hearts: The fixt marke gives the shooter ayme; And Ladyes lookes have power to mayme; Now 'twixt their lips, now in their eyes, Wrapt in a smile, or kisse, Love lyes; Then flye betimes, for only they Conquer love that run away. SONG. To my inconstant Mistris. When thou, poore excommunicate From all the joyes of love, shalt see The full reward, and glorious fate, Which my strong faith shall purchase me, Then curse thine owne inconstancie. A fayrer hand then thine, shall cure That heart, which thy false oathes did wound; And to my soule, a soule more pure Than thine, shall by Loves band be bound, And both with equall glory crown'd. Then shalt thou weepe, entreat, complaine To Love, as I did once to thee; When all thy teares shall be as vaine As mine were then, for thou shalt bee Damn'd for thy false Apostasie. SONG. Perswasions to enjoy. If the quick spirits in your cye Now languish, and anon must dye; If every sweet, and every grace, Must fly from that forsaken face: Then (Celia) let us reape our joyes, E're time such goodly fruit destroyes. Or, if that golden fleece must grow For ever, free from aged snow: If those bright Suns must know no shade, Nor your fresh beauties ever fade; Then feare not (Celia) to bestow, What still being gather'd, still must grow. Thus, either Time his Sickle brings In vaine, or else in vaine his wings. A deposition from Love. I was foretold, your rebell sex, Nor love, nor pitty knew; And with what scorne, you use to vex Poore hearts, that humbly sue; Yet I believ'd, to crowne our paine, Could we the fortresse win, The happy lover sure should gaine, A Paradise within: I thought loves plagues, like Dragons sate, Only to fright us at the gate. But I did enter, and enjoy, What happy lovers prove; For I could kisse, and sport, and toy, And tast those sweets of love; Which had they but a lasting state, Or if in Celia's brest, The force of love might nor abate; Jove were too meane a guest. But now her breach of faith, far more Afflicts, then did her scorne before. Hard fate! to have been once possest As victor, of a heart, Atchiev'd with labour, and unrest, And then forc'd to depart. If the stout Foe will not resigne, When I besiege a Towne, I lose, but what was never mine; But he that is cast downe From enjoy'd beautie, feeles a woe, Onely deposed Kings can know. Ingratefull beauty threatned. Know Celia, (since thou art so proud,) 'Twas I that gave thee thy renowne: Thou hadst, in the forgotten crowd Of common beauties, liv'd unknowne, Had not my verse exhal'd thy name, And with it, ympt the wings of fame. That killing power is none of thine, I gave it to thy voyce, and eyes: Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine; Thou art my starre, shin'st in my skies; Then dart not from thy borrowed sphere Lightning on him, that fixt thee there. Tempt me with such affrights no more, Lest what I made, I uncreate; Let fooles thy mystique formes adore, I'le know thee in thy mortall state: Wife Poets that wrap't Truth in tales, Knew her themselves, through all her vailes. Disdaine returned. Hee that loves a Rosie cheeke, Or a corall lip admires, Or from star-like eyes doth seeke, Fuell to maintaine his fires; As old Time makes these decay, So his flames must waste away. But a smooth, and stedfast mind, Gentle thoughts, and calme desires, Hearts, with equall love combind, Kindle never dying fires. Where these are not, I despise Lovely cheekes, or lips, or eyes. No teares, Celia, now shall win, My resolv'd heart, to returne; I have searcht thy soule within, And find nought, but pride, and scorne; I have learn'd thy arts, and now Can disdaine as much as thou. Some power, in my revenge convay, That love to her, I cast away. A Looking-Glasse. That flattring Glasse, whose smooth face weares Your shadow, which a Sunne appeares, Was once a river of my teares. About your cold heart, they did make A circle, where the brinic lake Congeal'd, into a crystall cake. Gaze no more on that killing eye, For feare the native crueltie Doome you, as it doth all, to dye. For feare left the faire object move, Your froward heart to fall in love, Then you yourselfe my rivall prove. Looke rather on my pale checkes pin'de, There view your beauties, there you'le finde A faire face, but a cruell minde. Be not for ever frozen, coy; One beame of love, will soone destroy, And melt that yee, to flouds of joy. An Elegie on the La: Pen: sent to my Mistresse out of France. Let him, who from his tyrant Mistresse, did This day receive his cruell doome, forbid His eyes to weepe that losse, and let him here Open those floud-gates, to bedeaw this beere; So shall those drops, which else would be but brine, Be turn'd to Manna, falling on her shrine. Let him, who banisht farre from her deere sight Whom his soule loves, doth in that absence write. Or lines of passion, or some powerfull charmes, To vent his owne griefe, or unlock her armes; Take off his pen, and in sad verse bemone This generall sorrow, and forget his owne; So may those Verses live, which else must dye; For though the Muses give eternitie When they embalme with verse, yet she could give Life unto that Muse, by which others live. Oh pardon me (faire soule) that boldly have Dropt, though but one teare, on thy silent grave. And writ on that earth, which such honour had, To cloath that flesh, wherein thy selfe was clad. And pardon me (sweet Saint) whom I adore, That I this tribute pay, out of the store Of lines, and teares, that's only due to thee; Oh, doe not thinke it new Idolatrie; Though you are only soveraigne of this Land, Yet universall losses may command A subsidie from every private eye, And presse each pen to write; so to supply, And feed the common griefe; if this excuse Prevaile not, take these teares to your owne use, As shed for you; for when I saw her dye, I then did thinke on your mortalitie; For since nor vertue, will, nor beautie, could Preserve from Death's hand, this their heavenly mould. Where they were framed all, and where they dwelt, I then knew you must dye too, and did melt Into these teares: but thinking on that day, And when the gods resolv'd to take away A Saint from us; I that did know what dearth There was of such good soules upon the earth, Began to feare left Death, their Officer Might have mistooke, and taken thee for her; So had'st thou rob'd us of that happinesse Which she in heaven, and I in thee possesse. But what can heaven to her glory adde? The prayses she hath dead, living she had, To say she's now an Angell, is no more Praise then she had, for she was one before; Which of the Saints can shew more votaries Then she had here? even those that did despise The Angels, and may her now she is one, Did whilst she liv'd with pure devotion Adore, and worship her; her vertues had All honour here, for this world was too bad To hate, or envy her, these cannot rise So high, as to repine at Deities: But now she's 'mongst her fellow Saints, they may Be good enough to envy her, this way There's losse i'th' change 'twixt heav'n and earth, if she Should leave her servants here below, to be Hated of her competitors above; But sure her matchlesse goodnesse needs must move Those blest soules to admire her excellence; By this meanes only can her journey hence To heaven prove gaine, if as she was but here Worshipt by men, she be by Angels there. But I must weepe no more over this urne, My teares to their owne chanell must returne; And having ended these sad obsequies, My Muse must back to her old exercise, To tell the story of my martyrdome: But, oh thou Idoll of my soule, become Once pittifull, that she may change her stile, Drie up her blubbred eyes, and learne to smile. Rest then blest soule, for as ghosts flye away, When the shrill Cock proclaimes the infant-day, So must I hence, for loe I see from farre, The minions of the Muses comming are, Each of them bringing to thy sacred Herse, In either eye a teare, each hand a Verse. To my Mistresse in absence. Though I must live here, and by force Of your command suffer divorce; Though I am parted, yet my mind, (That's more my selfe) still stayes behind; I breath in you, you keepe my heart; 'Twas but a carkasse that did part. Then though our bodyes are dis-joynd, As things that are to place confin'd; Yet let our boundlesse spirits meet, And in loves spheare each other greet; There let us worke a mystique wreath, Vnknowne unto the world beneath; There let our claspt loves sweetly twin; There let our secret thoughts unseen, Like nets be weav'd, and inter-twin'd, Wherewith wee'le catch each others mind: There whilst our soules doe fit and kisse, Tasting a sweet, and subtle blisse, (Such as grosse lovers cannot know, Whose hands, and lips, meet here below;) Let us looke downe, and marke what paine Our absent bodyes here sustaine, And smile to see how farre away The one, doth from the other stray; Yet burne, and languish with desire To joyne, and quench their mutuall fire. There let us joy to see from farre, Our emulous flames at loving warre, Whilst both with equall luster shine, Mine bright as yours, yours bright as mine. There seated in those heavenly bowers, Wee'le cheat the lag, and lingring houres, Making our bitter absence sweet, Till soules, and bodyes both, may meet. To her in absence. A SHIP. Tost in a troubled sea of griefes, I sloate Farre from the shore, in a storme-beaten boat, Where my sad thoughts doe (like the compasse) show The severall points from which crosse winds doe blow. My heart doth like the needle toucht with love Still fixt on you, point which way I would move. You are the bright Pole-starre, which in the darke Of this long absence, guides my wandring barke. Love is the Pilot, but o're-come with feare Of your displeasure, dares not homewards steare; My fearefull hope hangs on my trembling sayle; Nothing is wanting but a gentle gale, Which pleasant breath must blow from your sweet lip, Bid it but move, and quick as thought this Ship Into your armes, which are my port, will flye Where it for ever shall at Anchor lye. SONG. Eternitie of love protested. How ill doth he deserve a lovers name, Whose pale weake flame, Cannot retaine His heate in spight of absence or disdaine; But doth at once, like paper set on fire, Burne, and expire? True love can never change his seat, Nor did he ever love, that could retreat. That noble flame, which my brest keeps alive, shall still survive, When my soule's fled; Nor shall my love dye, when my bodye's dead, That shall waite on me to the lower shade, And never sade, My very ashes in their urne, Shall like a hallowed Lamp, for ever burne. Upon some alterations in my Mistresse, after my departure into France. Oh gentle Love, doe not forsake the guide Of my fraile Barke, on which the swelling tide Of ruthlesse pride Doth beat, and threaten wrack from every side. Gulfes of disdaine, do gape to overwhelme This boat, nigh sunke with griefe, whilst at the helme Dispaire commands; And round about, the shifting sands Of faithlesse love, and false inconstancie, With rocks of crueltie, Stop up my passage to the neighbour Lands. My sighs have rays'd those winds, whose fury beares My sayles er'e boord, and in their place spreads teares, And from my teares This sea is sprung, where naught but Death appeares, A mystie cloud of anger, hides the light Of my faire starre, and every where black night Vsurpes the place Of those bright rayes, which once did grace My forth-bound Ship, but when it could no more Behold the vanisht shore, In the deep flood she drown'd her beamie face. Good counsell to a young Maid. When you the Sun-burnt Pilgrim see fainting with thirst, hast to the springs; Marke how at first with bended knee He courts the crystall Nimphs, and flings His body to the earth, where He Prostrate adores the flowing Deitie. But when his sweaty face is drencht In her coole waves, when from her sweet Bosome, his burning thirst is quencht; Then marke how with disdainfull feet He kicks her banks, and from the place That thus refresht him, moves with sullen pace. So shalt thou be despis'd, faire Maid, When by the sated lover tasted; What first he did with teares invade, Shall afterwards with scorne be wasted; When all thy Virgin-springs grow dry, When no streames shall be left, but in thine eye. Celia bleeding, to the Surgeon. Fond man, that canst beleeve her blood Will from those purple chanels flow; Or that the pure untainted flood, Can any foule distemper know; Or that thy weake steele can incize The Crystall case, wherein it lyes. Know; her quick blood, proud of his seat, Runs dauncing through her azure veines; Whose harmony no cold, nor heat Disturbs, whose hue no tincture staines; And the hard rock wherein it dwells, The keenest darts of Love repels. But thou reply'st, behold she bleeds; Foole, thou'rt deceivd; and dost not know The mystique knot whence this proceeds, How Lovers in each other grow; Thou struckst her arme, but 'twas my heart Shed all the blood, felt all the smart. To T.H. a Lady resembling my Mistresse. Fayre copie of my Celia's face, Twin of my soule, thy perfect grace Claymes in my love an equall place. Disdaine not a divided heart, Though all be hers, you shall have part; Love is not tyde to rules of art. For as my soule first to her flew, Yet stay'd with me; so now 'tis true It dwells with her, though fled to you. Then entertaine this wandring guest, And if it love, allow it rest; It left not, but mistooke the nest. Nor thinke my love, or your faire eyes Cheaper, 'cause from the sympathise You hold with her, these flames arise. To Lead, or Brasse, or some such bad Mettall, a Princes stamp may adde That valew, which it never had. But to the pure refined Ore; The stamp of Kings imparts no more Worth, then the mettall held before, Only the Image gives the rate To Subjects, in a forraine State 'Tis priz'd as much for its owne waight. So though all other hearts resigne To your pure worth, yet you have mine Only because you are her coyne. To Saxham. Though frost, and snow, lockt from mine eyes, That beautie which without dore lyes; Thy gardens, orchards, walkes, that so I might not all thy pleasures know; Yet (Saxham) thou within thy gate, Art of thy selfe so delicate; So full of native sweets, that blesse Thy roofe with inward happinesse; As neither from, nor to thy store Winter takes ought, or Spring addes more. The cold and frozen ayre had sterv'd Much poore, if not by thee preserv'd; Whose prayers have made thy Table blest With plenty, far above the rest. The season hardly did afford Course cates unto thy neighbours board, Yet thou hadst daintyes, as the skie Had only been thy Volarie; Or else the birds, fearing the snow Might to another deluge grow: The Pheasant, Partiridge, and the Larke, Flew to thy house, as to the Arke. The willing Oxe, of himselfe came Home to the slaughter, with the Lambe, And every beast did thither bring Himselfe, to be an offering. The scalie herd, more pleasure tooke, Bath'd in thy dish, then in the brooke, Water, Earth, Ayre, did all conspire, To pay their tributes to thy fire, Whose cherishing flames themselves divide Through every roome, where they deride The night, and cold abroad; whilst they Like funs within, keepe endlesse day. Those chearfull beames send forth their light, To all that wander in the night, And seeme to becken from aloofe, The weary Pilgrim to thy roofe; Where if refresh't, he will away, Hee's fairly welcome, or if stay Farre more, which he shall hearty find, Both from the Master, and the Hinde. The strangers welcome, each man there Stamp'd on his chearfull brow, doth weare; Nor doth this welcome, or his cheere Grow lesse, 'cause he staies longer here. There's none observes (much lesse repines) How often this man sups or dines. Thou hast no Porter at the doore T'examine, or keep back the poore; Nor locks, nor bolts; thy gates have bin Made onely to let strangers in; Vntaught to shut, they doe not feare To stand wide open all the yeare; Carelesse who enters, for they know, Thou never didst deserve a foe; And as for theeves, thy bountie's such; They cannot steale, thou giv'st so much. Upon a Ribband. This silken wreath, which circles in mine arme Is but an Emblem of that mystique charme, Where with the magique of your beauties binds My captive soule, and round about it winds Fetters of lasting love; This hath entwind My flesh alone, That hath empalde my mind: Time may weare out These soft weak bands; but Those Strong chaines of brasse, Fate shall not discompose. This holy relique may preserve my wrist, But my whole frame doth by That power subsist: To That my prayers and sacrifice, to This I onely pay a superstitious kisse: This but the Idoll, That's the Deitie, Religion there is due; Here ceremonie. That I receive by faith, This but in trust; Here I may tender dutie, There I must. This order as a Layman I may beare, But I become Loves Priest when That I weare. This moves like ayre; That as the Center stands: That knot your vertue tide; This but your hands: That Nature fram'd, but This was made by Art; This makes my arme your prisoner, That my heart. To the King at his entrance into Saxham, by Master Io, Crofts. Sir, Ere you passe this threshold, stay, And give your creature leave to pay Those pious rites, which unto you, As to our houshold Gods, are due. In stead of sacrifice, each brest Is like a flaming Altar, drest With zealous fires, which from pure hearts Love mixt with loyaltie imparts. Incense, nor gold have we, yet bring As rich, and sweet an offering; And such as doth both these expresse, Which is our humble thankfulnesse. By which is payd the All we owe To gods above, or men below. The slaughter'd beast, whose flesh should feed The hungrie flames, we, for pure need Dresse for your supper, and the gore Which should be dasht on every dore. We change into the lustie blood Of youthfull Vines, of which a flood Shall sprightly run through all your veines, First to your health, then your faire traines. We shall want nothing but good fare, To shew your welcome, and our care; Such rarities that come from farre, From poore mens houses banisht are; Yet wee'le expresse in homely cheare, How glad we are to see you here. Wee'le have what e're the season yeelds, Out of the neighbouring woods, and fields; For all the dainties of your board, Will only be what those afford; And having supt, we may perchance Present you with a countrie dance. Thus much your servants, that beare sway Here in your absence, bade me say, And beg besides, you'ld hither bring, Only the mercy of a King; And not the greatnesse, since they have A thousand faults must pardon crave; But nothing that is fit to waite Vpon the glory of your state. Yet your gracions favour will, They hope, as heretofore, shine still On their endeavours, for they swore Should Jove descend, they could no more. Upon the sicknesse of (E.S.) Mvst she then languish, and we sorrow thus, And no kind god helpe her, nor pitty us? Is justice fled from heaven? can that permit A foule deformed ravisher to sit Vpon her Virgin cheek, and pull from thence The Rose-buds in their maiden excellence? To spread cold palenesie on her lips, and chase The frighted Rubies from their native place? To lick up with his searching slames, a flood Of dissolv'd Corall, flowing in her blood; And with the dampes of his infectious breath, Print on her brow moyst characters of death? Must the cleare light, 'gainst course of nature cease In her faire eyes, and yet the flames encrease? Must feavers shake this goodly tree, and all That ripened fruit from the faire branches fall, Which Princes have desir'd to taste? must she Who hath preserv'd her spotlesse chastitie From all solicitation, now at last By Agues, and diseases be embrast? Forbid it holy Dian; else who shall Pay vowes, or let one graine of Incense fall On thy neglected Altars, if thou blesse No better this thy zealous Votaresse? Haste then, O maiden Goddesse, to her ayde, Let on thy quiver her pale cheeke be layd; And rock her fainting body in thine armes; Then let the God of Musick, with still charmes, Her restlesse eyes in peacefull slumbers close, And with soft straines sweeten her calme repose. Cupid descend; and whilst Apollo sings, Fanning the coole ayre with thy panting wings, Ever supply her with refreshing wind; Let thy faire mother, with her tresses bind Her labouring temples, with whose balmie sweat, She shall perfume her hairie Coronet, Whose precious drops, shall upon every fold Hang, like rich Pearles about a wreath of gold: Her looser locks, as they unbraded lye, Shall spread themselves into a Canopie: Vnder whose shadow let her rest secure From chilling cold, or burning Calenture; Vnlesse she freeze with yee of chast desires, Or holy Hymen kindle nuptiall fires. And when at last Death comes to pierce her heart. Convey into his hand thy golden dart. A New-yeares Sacrifice. To Lucinda. Those that can give, open their hands this day, Those that cannot, yet hold them up to pray; That health may crowne the seasons of this yeare. And mirth daunce round the circle, that no teare (Vnlesse of joy) may with its brinie dew, Discolour on your cheeke the rosie hue; That no accesse of yeares presume to abate, Your beauties ever-flourishing estate: Such cheape, and vulgar wishes, I could lay As triviall offrings at your feet this day; But that it were Apostasie in me, To send a prayer to any Deitie But your divine selfe, who have power to give Those blessings unto others, such as live Like me, by the sole influence of your eyes, Whose faire aspects governe our destinies. Such Incense, vowes, and holy rites, as were To the involved Serpent of the yeare, Payd by Egyptian Priests, lay I before Lucinda's sacred shrine, whilst I adore Her beauteous eyes, and her pure Altars dresse With gums and spice of humble Thankfulnesse; So may my Goddesse from her heaven, inspire My frozen bosome with a Delphique fire, And then the world shall by that glorious flame, Behold the blaze of thy immortall name. SONG. To one who when I prais'd my Mistris beautie, said I was blind. Wonder not though I am blind, For you must bee Darke in your eyes, or in your mind, If when you see Her face, you prove not blind like me. If the powerfull beames that flye From her eye, And those amorous sweets that lye Scatter'd, in each neighbouring part, Find a passage to your heart; Then you'le confesse your mortall sight Too weake, for such a glorious light; For if her graces you discover, You grow like me a dazel'd lovers But if those beauties you not spy, Then are you blinder farre then I. SONG. To my Mistris, I burning in love. I burne, and cruell you, in vaine Hope to quench me with disdaine; If from your eyes, those sparkles came, That have kindled all this flame, What bootes it me, though now you shrowde Those fierce Comets in a cloude? Since all the flames that I have felt, Could your snow yet never melt, Nor, can your snow (though you should take Alpes into your bosome) slake The heate of my enamour'd heart; But with wonder learne Loves art: No seaes of yce can coole desire, Equall flames must quench Loves fire: Then thinke not that my heat can dye, Till you burne aswell as I. SONG. To her againe, she burning in a Feaver. Now she burnes as well as I, Yet my heat can never dye; She burnes that never knew desire. She that was yce, she that was fire. Shee whose cold heart, chaste thoughts did arme So, as Loves flames could never warme The frozen bosome where it dwelt, She burnes, and all her beauties melt; She burnes, and cryes, Loves fires are milde; Feavers are Gods, He's a childe. Love; let her know the difference Twixt the heat of soule, and sence. Touch her with thy flames divine, So shalt thou quench her fire, and mine. Upon the Kings sicknesse. Sicknesse, the minister of death, doth lay So strong a seige against our brittle clay, As whilst it doth our weake forts singly win, It hopes at length to take all man-kind in: First, it begins upon the wombe to waite, And doth the unborne child there uncreate; Then rocks the cradle where the infant lyes, Where, e're it fully be alive, it dyes. It never leaves fond youth, untill it have Found, or an early, or a later grave. By thousand subtle sleights from heedlesse man, It cuts the short allowance of a span. And where both sober life, and Art combine To keepe it out, Age makes them both resigne. Thus by degrees it onely gain'd of late, The weake, the aged, or intemperate; But now the Tyrant hath found out a way By which the sober, strong, and young, decay: Entring his royall limbes that is our head, Through us his mystique limbs the paine is spread, That man that doth not feele his part, hath none In any part of his dominion; If he hold land, that earth is forfeited, And he unfit on any ground to tread. This griefe is felt at Court, where it doth move Through every joynt, like the true soule of love. All those faire starres that doe attend on Him, Whence they deriv'd their light, wax pale and dim. That ruddie morning beame of Majestie, Which should the Suns ecclipsed light supply, Is overcast with mists, and in the liew Of cherefull rayes, sends us downe drops of dew: That curious forme made of an earth refin'd, At whose blest birth, the gentle Planets shin'd With faire aspects, and sent a glorious flame To animate so beautifull a frame; That Darling of the Gods and men, doth weare A cloude on's brow, and in his eye a teare: And all the rest (save when his dread command Doth bid them move,) like livelesse statues stand; So full a griefe, so generally worne Shewes a good King is sick, and good men mourne. SONG. To a Lady not yet enjoy'd by her Husband. Come Celia, fixe thine eyes on mine, And through those Crystalls our soules flitting, Shall a pure wreathe of eye-beames twine, Our loving hearts together knitting; Let Eaglets the bright Sun survey, Though the blind Mole discerne not day: When cleere Aurora leaves her mate, The light of her gray eyes dispising, Yet all the world doth celebrate With sacrifice, her faire up-rising. Let Eaglets, &amp;c. A Dragon kept the golden fruit, Yet he those dainties never tasted; As others pin'd in the pursuit, So he himselfe with plentie wasted: Let Eaglets, &amp;c. SONG. The willing Prisoner to his Mistris. Let fooles great Cupids yoake disdaine, Loving their owne wild freedome better; Whilst proud of my triumphant chaine I sit, and court my beauteous fetter. Her murdring glances, snaring haires, And her bewitching smiles, so please me, As he brings ruine, that repaires The sweet afflictions that disease me. Hide not those panting balls of snow, With envious voyles, from my beholding; Vnlock those lips, their pearly row, In a sweet smile of love unfolding. And let those eyes, whose motion wheeles The restlesse Fate of every lover, Survey the paines, my sicke heart feeles, And wounds themselves, have made discover. A flye that flew into my Mistris her eye. When this Flye liv'd, she us'd to play In the Sun-shine all the day; Till comming neere my Celia's sight, She found a new, and unknowne light So full of glory, as it made The noone-day Sun a gloomy shade; Then this amorous Flye became My rivall, and did court my flame. She did from hand to bosome skip, And from her breath, her cheeke, and lip, Suckt all the incense, and the spice, And grew a bird of Paradise: At last into her eye she flew, There scorcht in flames, and drown'd in dew: Like Phaeton from the Suns spheare She fell, and with her dropt a teare: Of which a pearle was straight compos'd, Wherein her ashes lye enclos'd. Thus she receiv'd from Celia's eye, Funerall flame, tombe Obsequie. SONG. Celia singing. Harke how my Celia, with the choyce Musique of her hand and voyce Stills the loude wind; and makes the wilde Incensed Bore, and Panther milde! Marke how those statues like men move, Whilst men with wonder statues prove! This stiffe rock bends to worship her, That Idoll turnes Idolater. Now see how all the new inspir'd Images, with love are fir'd! Harke how the tender Marble grones, And all the late transformed stones, Court the faire Nymph with many a teare, Which she (more slony then they were) Beholds with unrelenting mind; Whilst they amaz'd to see combin'd Such matchlesse beautie, with disdaine, Are all turn'd into stones againe. SONG. Celia singing. You that thinke Love can convey, No other way, But through the eyes, into the heart, His fatall Dart: Close up those casements, and but heare This Syren sings And on the wing Of her sweet voyce, it shall appeare That Love can enter at the eare: Then unvaile your eyes, behold The curious mould Where that voyce dwels, and as we know, When the Cocks crow, We freely may Gaze on the day; So may you, when the Musique's done Awake and see the rising Sun. SONG. To one that desired to know my Mistris. Seeke not to know my love, for shee Hath vow'd her constant faith to me; Her milde aspects are mine, and thou Shalt only find a stormy brow: For if her beautie stirre desire In me, her kisses quench the fire. Or, I can to Love's fountaine goe, Or dwell upon her hills of snow. But when thou burn'st, she shall not spare One gentle breath to coole the ayre. Thou shalt not climbe those Alpes, nor spye Where the sweet springs of Venus lye; Search hidden Nature, and there find A treasure to inrich thy mind; Discover Arts not yet reveal'd, But let my Mistris live conceal'd; Though men by knowledge wiser grow, Yet bereft is wisdome not to know. In the person of a Lady to her inconstant servant. When on the Altar of my hand, (Bedeaw'd with many a kisse, and teare;) Thy now revolted heart, did stand An humble Martyr, thou didst sweare Thus; (and the God of love did heare,) By those bright glances of thine eye, Vnlesse thou pitty me, I dye. When first those perjurd lips of thine, Bepal'd with blasting sighes, did seale Their violated faith on mine, From the soft bosome that did heale Thee, thou my melting heart didst steale; My soule enflam'd with thy false breath, Poyson'd with kisses, suckt in death. Yet I nor hand, nor lip will move, Revenge, or mercy, to procure From the offended God of love; My curse is fatall, and my pure Love, shall beyond thy scorne endure: If I implore the Gods, they'le find Thee too ingratefull, me too kind. Truce in Love entreated. No more, blind God, for see my heart Is made thy Quiver, where remaines No voyd place for another Dart; And alas! that conquest gaines Small praise, that only brings away A tame and unresisting prey. Behold a nobler foe, all arm'd, Defies thy weake Artillerie, That hath thy Bow and Quiver charm'd; A rebell beautie, conquering Thee! If thou dar'st equall combat try, Wound her, for 'tis for her I dye. To my Rivall. Hence vaine intruder, hast away, Wash not with thy unhallowed brine The foot-steps of my Celia's shrine; Nor on her purer Altars lay Thy empty words, accents that may Some looser Dame to love encline; She must have offerings more divine; Such pearlie drops, as youthfull May, Scatters before the rising day; Such smooth soft language, as each line Might stroake an angry God, or stay Joves thunder, make the hearers pine With envie; doe this, thou shalt he Servant to her, Rivall with me. Boldnesse in love. Marke how the bashfull morne, in vaine Courts the amorous Marigold, With sighing blasts, and weeping raine; Yet she refuses to unfold. But when the Planet of the day, Approacheth with his powerfull ray, Then she spreads, then she receives His warmer beames into her virgin leaves, So shalt thou thrive in love, fond Boy; If thy teares, and sighes discover Thy griefe, thou never shalt enjoy The just reward of a bold lover: But when with moving accents, thou Shalt constant faith, and service vow, Thy Celia shall receive those charmes With open eares, and with unfolded armes. A Pastorall Dialogue. Celia. Cleon. As Celia rested in the shade With Cleon by her side; The swaine thus courted the young Maid, And thus the Nymph replide. CL. Sweet! let thy captive, fetters weare Made of thine armes, and hands; Till such as thraldome scorne, or feare, envie those happy bands CE. Then thus my willing armes I winde About thee, and am so Thy pris'ner; for my selfe I bind, Vntill I let thee goe. CL. Happy that slave, whom the faire soe Tyes in so soft a chaine. CE. Farre happier I, but that I know Thou wilt breake loose againe. CL. By thy immortall beauties never. CE. Fraile as thy love's thine oath. CL. Though beautie fade, my faith lasts ever. CE. Time will destroy them both. CL. I dote not on thy snow-white skin. CE. What then? CL. Thy purer mind. CE. It lov'd too soone. CL. Thou hadst not bin So faire, if not so kind. CE. Oh strange vaine fancie! CL. But yet true. CE. Prove it. CL. Then make a brade Of those loose flames, that circle you, My sunnes, and yet your shade. CE. 'Tis done. CL. Now give it me. CE Thus thou Shalt thine owne errour find, If these were beauties, I am now Lesse faire, because more kind. CL. You shall confesse you erre; that haire shall it not change the hue, Or leave the golden mountaine bare? CE. Aye me! it is too true. CL. But this small wreathe, shall ever stay In its first native prime, And smiling when the rest decay, The triumphs sing of time. CE. Then let me cut from thy faire grove, One branch, and let that be An embleme of eternall love, For such is mine to thee. CL. Thus are we both redeem'd from time, I by thy grace. CL. And I Shall live in thy immortall rime, Vntill the Muses dye. CL. By heaven! CE. Sweare not; if I must weepe, Jove shall not smile at me; This kisse, my heart, and thy faith keepe. CL. This breathes my soule to thee. Then forth the thicket Thirsis rusht, Where he saw all their play: The swaine stood still, and smil'd, and blusht, The Nymph fled fast away. Griefe ingrost. Wherefore doe thy sad numbers flow So full of woe? Why dost thou melt in such soft straines, Whilst she disdaines? If she must still denie, Weepe not, but dye: And in thy Funerall fire, Shall all her fame expire. Thus both shall perish, and as thou on thy Hearse Shall want her teares, so she shall want thy Verse; Repine not then at thy blest state: Thou art above thy fate; But my faire Celia will nor give Love enough to make me live; Nor yet dart from her eye Scorne enough to make me dye. Then let me weepe alone, till her kind breath, Or blow my teares away, or speake my death. A Pastorall Dialogue. Shepherd. Nymph. Chorus. Shep. This mossie bank they prest Ny. That aged Oak Did canopie the happy payre All night from the dampe ayre. Cho. Here let us sit and sing the words they spoke, Till the day breaking, their embraces broke. Shep. See love, the blushes of the morne appeare, And now she hangs her pearlie store (Rob'd from the Easterne shore) I'th' Couslips bell, and Roses rare: Sweet, I must stay no longer here. Nymph. Those streakes of doubtfull light, usher not day, But shew my sunne must set; no Morne Shall shine till thou returne, The yellow Planets, and the gray Dawne, shall attend thee on thy way: Shep. If thine eyes guild my pathes, they may forbeare Their uselesse shine. Nymph. My teares will quite Extinguish their faint light. She Those drops will make their beames more cleare, Loves flames will shine in every teare. Cho. They kist, and wept, and from their lips, and eyes, In a mixt dew, of brinie sweet, Their joyes, and sorrowes meet, But she cryes out. Nymp. Shepherd arise, The Sun betrayes us else to spies. Shep. The winged houres flye fast, whilst we embrace, But when we want their help to meet, They move with leaden feet. Nym. Then let us pinion Time, and chase The day for ever from this place. Shep. Harke! Ny. Aye me stay! She. For ever. Ny. No, arise, Wee must be gone. Shep. My nest of spice. Nymph. My soule. Shep. my Paradise. Cho. Neither could say farewell, but through their eyes Griefe, interrupted speach with teares supplyes. Red, and white Roses. Reade in these Roses, the sad story Of my hard fate, and your owne glory: In the White you may discover The palenesse of a fainting lover: In the Red, the flames still feeding On my heart with fresh wounds bleeding. The White will tell you how I languish, And the Red expresse my anguish. The white my innocence displaying, The Red my martyrdome betraying. The frownes that on your brow resided. Have those Roses thus divided. Oh let your smiles but cleare the weather, And then they both shall grow together. To my Cousin (C.R.) marrying my Lady (A.) Happy Youth, that shalt possesse Such a spring-tyde of delight, As the sated Appetite Shall enjoying such excesse, With the flood of pleasure lesle. When the Hymene all Rite Is perform'd, invoke the night, That it may in shadowes dresse Thy too reall happinesse; Else (at Semele) the bright Deitie in her full might, May thy feeble soule oppresse. Strong perfumes, and glaring light, Oft destroy both smell, and sight. A Lover upon an Accident necessitating his departure, consults with Reason. LOVER. Weepe not, nor backward turne your beames Fond eyes, sad sighes locke in your breath, Lest on this wind, or in those streames My griev'd soule flye, or sayle to death. Fortune destroys me if I stay, Love kills me if I goe away: Since Love, and Fortune, both are blind, Come Reason, and resolve my doubtfull mind. REASON. Flye, and blind Fortune be thy guide, And 'gainst the blinder God rebell, Thy love-sick heart shall not reside Where scorne, and selfe-will'd error dwell. Where entrance, vnto Truth is bar'd; Where Love and Faith find no reward; For, my just hand may sometime move The wheele of Fortune, not the spheare of Love. Parting, Celia weepes. Weepe not (my deare) for I shall goe Loaden enough with mine owne woe; Adde not thy heavinesse to mine, Since Fate our pleasures must dis-joyne, Why should our sorrowes meet? if I Must goe, and lose thy company, I wish not theirs; it shall relieve My griefe, to thinke thou dost not grieve. Yet grieve, and weepe, that I may beare Every sigh, and every teare Away with me, so shall thy brest And eyes discharg'd, enjoy their rest. And it will glad my heart to see, Thou wer't thus loath to part with mee. A Rapture. I will enjoy thee now my Celia, come And flye with me to Loves Elizium: The Gyant, Honour, that keepes cowards out; Is but a Masquer, and the servile rout Of baser subjects onely, bend in vaine To the vast I doll, whilst the nobler traine Of valiant souldiers, daily sayle betweene The huge Collosses legs, and passe unseene Vnto the blissfull shore; be bold, and wise, And we shall enter, the grim Swisse denies Only to tame fooles a passage, that not know He is but forme, and onely frights in show The duller eyes that looke from farre; draw neere, And thou shalt scorne, what we were wont to feare. We shall see how the stalking Pageant goes With borrowed legs, a heavie load to those That made, and beare him; not as we once thought The seed of Gods, but a weake modell wrought By greedy men, that seeke to enclose the common, And within private armes empale free woman. Come then, and mounted on the wings of love Wee'le cut the flitting ayre, and sore above. The Monsters head, and in the noblest seates Of those blest shades, quench, and renew our heates. There, shall the Queens of Love, and Innocence, Beautie and Nature, banish all offence From our close Ivy twines, there I'le behold Thy bared snow, and thy unbraded gold. There, my enfranchiz'd hand, on every side Shall o're thy naked polish'd Ivory slide. No curtaine there, though of transparant lawne, Shall be before thy virgin-treasure drawne; But the rich Mine, to the enquiring eye Expos'd, shall ready still for mintage lye, And we will coyne young Cupids. There, a bed Of Roses, and fresh Myrtles, shall be spread Vnder the cooler shade of Cypresse groves: Our pillowes, of the downe of Venus Doves, Whereon our panting lims wee'le gently lay In the faint respites of our active play; That so our slumbers, may in dreames have leisure, To tell the nimble fancie our past pleasure; And so our soules that cannot be embrac'd, Shall the embraces of our bodyes taste. Meane while the bubbling streame shall court the shore Th'enamoured chirping Wood-quire shall adore In varied tunes the Deitie of Love; The gentle blasts of Westerne winds, shall move The trembling leaves, &amp; through their close bows breath Still Musick, whilst we rest our selves beneath Their dancing shade; till a soft murmure, sent From soules entranc'd in amorous languishment Rowze us, and shoot into our veines fresh fire, Till we, in their sweet extasie expire. Then, as the empty Bee, that lately bore, Into the common treasure, all her store, Flyes 'bout the painted field with nimble wing, Deflowring the fresh virgins of the Spring. So will I rifle all the sweets, that dwell In my delicious Paradise, and swell My bagge with honey, drawne forth by the power Of fervent kisses, from each spicie flower. I'le seize the Rose-buds in their perfum'd bed, The Violet knots, like curious Mazes spread O're all the Garden, taste the ripned Cherry, The warme, firme Apple, tipt with corall berry: Then will I visit, with a wandring kisse, The vale of Lillies, and the Bower of blisse: And where the beauteous Region doth divide Into two milkie wayes, my lips shall slide Downe those smooth Allies, wearing as I goe A tract for lovers on the printed snow; Thence climbing o're the swelling Appenine, Retire into thy grove of Eglantine; Where I will all those ravisht sweets distill Through Loves Alimbique, and with Chimmique skill From the mixt masse, one soveraigne Balme derive, Then bring that great Elixar to thy hive. Now in more subtile wreathes I will entwine. My sinowie thighes, my legs and armes with thine; Thou like a sea of milke shalt lye display'd, Whilst I the smooth, calme Ocean, invade With such a tempest, as when Jove of old Fell downe on Danae in a storme of gold: Yet my tall Pine, shall in the Cyprian straight Ride safe at Anchor, and unlade her fraight: My Rudder, with thy bold hand, like a tryde, And skilfull Pilot, thou shalt steere, and guide My Bark into Loves channell, where it shall Dance, as the bounding waves doe rise or fall: Then shall thy circling armes, embrace and clip My willing bodie, and thy balmie lip Bathe me in juyce of kisses, whose perfume Like a religious incense shall consume, And send up holy vapours, to those powres That blesse our loves, and crowne our sportfull houres, That with such Halcion calmenesse, fix our soules In steadfast peace, as no affright controules. There, no rude sounds shake us with sudden starts, No jealous eares, when we untip our hearts Sucke our discourse in, no observing spies This blush, that glance traduce; no envious eyes Watch our close meetings, nor are we betrayd To Rivals, by the bribed chamber-maid. No wedlock bonds unwreathe our twisted loves; We seeke no midnight Arbor, no darke groves To hide our kisses, there, the hated name Of husband, wife, lust, modest, chaste, or shame, Are vaine and empty words, whose very sound Was never heard in the Elizian ground. All things are lawfull there, that may delight Nature, or unrestrained Appetite; Like, and enjoy, to will, and act, is one, We only sinne when Loves rites are not done. The Roman Lucrece there, reades the divine Lectures of Loves great master, Aretine, And knowes as well as Lais, how to move Her plyant body in the act of love. To quench the burning Ravisher, she hurles Her limbs into a thousand winding curles, And studies artfull postures, such as be Caru'd on the barke of every neighbouring tree By learned hands, that so adorn'd the rinde, Of those faire Plants, which as they lay entwinde, Have fann'd their glowing fires. The Grecian Dame, That in her endlesse webb, toyl'd for a name As fruitlesse as her worke, doth there display Her selfe before the Youth of Ithaca, And th'amorous sport of game some nights prefer, Before dull dreames of the lost Traveller. Daphne hath broke her barke, and that swift foot, Which th'angry Gods had fastned with a root To the fixt earth, doth now unfetter'd run, To meet th'embraces of the youthfull Sun: She hangs upon him, like his Delphique Lyre, Her kisses blow the old, and breath new fire: Full of her God, she sings inspired Layes, Sweet Odes of love, such as deserve the Bayes, Which she herselfe was. Next her, Laura lyes In Petrarchs learned armes, drying those eyes That did in such sweet smooth-pac'd numbers flow, As made the world enamour'd of his woe. These, and ten thousand Beauties more, that dy'de Slave to the Tyrant, now enlarg'd, deride His cancell'd lawes, and for their time mispent, Pay into Loves Exchequer double rent. Come then my Celia, wee'le no more forbeare To taste our joyes, struck with a Pannique feare, But will depose from his imperious sway This proud Vsurper and walke free, as they With necks unyoak'd; nor is it just that Hee Should fetter your soft sex with Chastitie, Which Nature made unapt for abstinence; When yet this false Inapostor can dispence With humane Justice, and with sacred right, And maugre both their lawes command me fight With Rivals, or with emulous Loves, that dare Equall with thine, their Mistresse eyes, or haire: If thou complaine of wrong, and call my sword To carve out thy revenge, upon that word He bids me fight and kill, or else he brands With markes of infamie my coward hands, And yet religion bids from blood-shed flye, And damns me for that Act. Then tell me why This Goblin Honour which the world adores, Should make men Atheists, and not women Whores. Epitaph on the Lady Mary Villers. The Lady Mary Villers lyes Vnder this stone; with weeping eyes The Parents that first gave her birth, And their sad Friends, lay'd her in earth: If any of them (Reader) were Knowne unto thee, shed a teare, Or if thy selfe possesse a gemme, As deare to thee, as this to them; Though a stranger to this place, Bewayle in theirs, thine owne hard case; For thou perhaps at thy returne Mayest find thy Darling in an Vrne. An other. [The purest Soule that e're was sent] The purest Soule that e're was sent Into a clayie tenement Inform'd this dust, but the weake mold Could the great guest no longer hold, The substance was too pure, the flame Too glorious that thither came, Ten thousand Cupids brought along A Grace on each wing, that did throng For place there, till they all opprest The seat in which they sought to rest; So the faire Modell broke, for want Of roome to lodge th'Inhabitant. An other. [This little Vault, this narrow roome] This little Vault, this narrow roome, Of Love, and Beautie is the tombe, The dawning beame that 'gan to cleare Our clouded skie, lyes darkned here, For ever set to us, by death Sent to enflame the world beneath; 'Twas but a bud, yet did containe More sweetnesse then shall spring againe, A budding starre that might have growne Into a Sun, when it had blowne. This hopefull beautie, did create New life in Loves declining state; But now his Empire ends, and we From fire, and wounding darts are free. His brand, his bow, let no man feare, The flames, the arrowes, all lye here. Epitaph on the Lady S. Wife to Sir W.S. The harmony of colours, features, grace, Resulting Ayres (the magicke of a face) Of musicall sweet tunes, all which combind, To crown one Soveraigne beauty, lies confind To this darke Vault. Shee was a Cabinet Where all the choysest stones of price were set; Whose native colours, and purest lustre lent Her eye, cheek, lip, a dazling ornament: Whose rare and hidden vertues, did expresse Her inward beauties, and minds fairer dresse; The constant Diamond, the wise Chrysolite, The devout Saphyre, Emrauld apt to write Records of Memory, cheerefull Agat, grave And serious Onyx, Tophaze, that doth save The braines calme temper, witty Amathist. This precious Quartie, or what else the list On Aarons Ephod planted had, shee wore: One only Pearle was wanting to her store; Which in her Saviours booke she found exprest, To purchase that, she sold death all the rest.

And here the precious dust is layd; Whose purely-tempered Clay was made So fine, that it the guest betray'd. Else the soule grew so fast within, It broke the outward shell of sinne. And so was hatch'd a Cherubin. In heigth, it soar'd to God above; In depth, it did to knowledge move, And spread in breadth to generall love. Before, a pious duty shind To Parents, courtesie behind, On either side an equall mind, Good to the Poore, to kindred deare, To servants kind, to friendship cleare, To nothing but her selfe, severe. So though a Virgin, yet a Bride To every Grace, she justifi'd A chaste Poligamie, and dy'd. Learne from hence (Reader) what small trust We owe this world, where vertue must Praile as our flesh, crumble to dust. On the Duke of Buckingham. Beatissimis Manibus charissimi viri Ill?? Conjunx sic Parentavit. When in the brazen leaves of Fame, The life, the death, of Buckingham Shall be recorded, if Truth's hand Incize the story of our Land, Posteritie shall see a faire Structure, by the studious care Of two Kings rays'd, that no lesse Their wisdome, than their Power expresse; By blinded zeale (whose doubtfull light Made murders scarlet robe seeme white, Whose vain-deluding phantosmes charm'd A clouded sullen soule, and arm'd A desperate hand, thirstie of blood) Torne from the faire earth where it stood; So the majestique fabrique fell. His Actions let our Annals tell: Wee write no Chronicle; This Pile Weares onely sorrowes face and stile, Which, even the envie that did waite Vpon his flourishing estate, Turn'd to soft pitty of his death, Now payes his Hearse; but that cheape breath Shall not blow here, nor th'unpure brine Puddle those streames that bathe this shrine. These are the pious Obsequies, Drop'd from his chast Wifes pregnant eyes In frequent showres, and were alone By her congealing sighes made stone, On which the Carver did bestow These formes and Characters of woe; So he the fashion onely lent, Whilst she wept all this Monument. Siste Hospes sive Indigena sive Advena vicissitudinis rerum memor pauca pellege. Reader, when these dumbe stones have told In borrowed speach, what Guest they hold; Thou shalt confesse, the vaine pursuit Of humane Glory yeelds no fruit, But an untimely Grave. If Fate Could constant happinesse create, Her Ministers, Fortune and Worth, Had here that myracle brought forth; They fix'd this childe of Honour, where No roome was left for Hope, or Feare, Of more, or lesse: so high, so great His growth was, yet so safe his seate. Safe in the circle of his Friends: Safe in his Loyall heart, and ends: Safe in his native valiant spirit: By favour safe, and safe by merit; Safe by the stampe of Nature, which Did strength, with shape and Grace enrich: Safe in the cheerefull Curtesies Of flowing gestures, speach, and eyes: Safe in his Bounties, which were more Proportion'd to his mind then store; Yet, though for vertue he becomes Involv'd Himselfe in borrowed summes; Safe in his care, he leaves betray'd No friend engag'd, no debt unpay'd. But though the starres conspire to shower Vpon one Head th'united power Of all their Graces, if their dire Aspects, must other brests inspire With vicious thoughts, a Murderers knife May cut (as here) their Darlings life.

Dialogue. Question From whence was first this furie hurld, This Jealousie into the world? Came she from Hell? Ans. No there doth raigne Eternall hatred, with disdaine, But she the Daughter is of Love, Sister of Beauty. Reply. Then above She must derive from the third Spheare Her heavenly Off-spring. Ans. Neither there From those immortall flames, could shee Draw her cold frozen Pedigree. Quest. If nor from heaven nor hell, where then Had she her birth? An. I'th'hearts of men, Beauty, and Feare did her create, Younger then Love, Elder then Hate, Sister to both, by Beauties side To love, by Feare to Hate ally'de: Despoyre her issue is, whose race Of fruitfull mischiefes drownes the space Of the wide earth in a swolne flood Of wrath, revenge, spight, rage, and blood. Quest. Oh how can such a spurious line Proceed from Parents so divine? Ans. As streames, which from their Crystall spring Doe sweet and cleare their waters bring, Yet mingling with the brackish maine, Nor taste, nor colour they retaine. Qu. Yet Rivers 'twixt their owne bankes flow Still fresh, can jealousie doe so? An. Yes, whilst shee keepes the stedfast ground Of Hope, and Feare, her equall bound; Hope sprung from favour, worth, or chance, Towar'ds the faire object doth advance; Whil'st Feare, as watchfull Sentinell Doth the invading Foe repell; And Jealousie thus mixt, doth prove The season, and the salt of love: But when Feare takes a larger scope, Stifling the child of Reason, Hope, Then sitting on th'usurped throne, She like a Tyrant rules alone, As the wilde Ocean unconfin'de, And raging as the Northern-winde. 2. Feminine Honour. In what esteeme did the Gods hold Faire Innocence, and the chaste bed, When scandall'd vertue might be bold Bare-foot, upon sharpe Cultures, spread O're burning coles to march, yet feele Nor scorching fire, nor piercing steele? Why, when the hard edg'd Iron did turne Soft as a bed of Roses blowne, When cruell flames forgot to burne Their chaste pure limbes, should man alone 'Gainst female Innocence conspire, Harder then steele, fiercer then fire? Oh haplesse sex! Vnequall sway Of partiall Honour! Who may know Rebels from subjects that obey, When malice can on vestals throw Disgrace, and Fame fixe high repute On the close shamelesse Prostitute? Vaine Honour! thou art but disguise A cheating voyce, a jugling art, No judge of vertue, whose pure eyes Court her owne Image in the heart, More pleas'd with her true figure there, Then her false Eccho in the care. 3. Separation of Lovers. Stop the chafed Bore, or play With the Lyons paw, yet feare From the Lovers side to teare Th'Idoll of his soule away. Though Love enter by the sight To the heart, it doth not flye From the mind, when from the eye The faire objects take their flight. But since want provokes desire, When we lose what wee before Have enjoy'd, as we want more, So is Love more set on fire. Love doth with an hungrie eye Glut on Beautie, and you may Safer snatch the Tygers prey Then his vitall food deny. Yet though absence for a space, Sharpen the keene Appetite, Long continuance, doth quite All Loves characters efface. For the sense not fed, denies Nourishment unto the minde, Which with expectation pinde, Love of a consumption dyes. 4. Incommunicabilitie of Love. Qvest. By what power was Love confinde To one object? who can binde, Or fixe a limit to the free-borne minde? An. Nature; for as bodyes may Move at once but in one way, So nor can mindes to more then one love stray. Reply. Yet I feele a double smart Loves twinn'd-flame, his forked dart. An. Then hath wilde lust, not love possest thy heart. Qu. Whence springs love? An. From beauty. Qu. Why Should th'effect not multiply As fast i'th'heart, as doth the cause i'th'eye? An. When two Beauties equall are, Sense preferring neither fayre, Desire stands still, distracted 'twixt the paire. So in equall distance lay Two fayre Lambes in the Wolfe's way; The hungry beast will sterve e're chuse his prey. But where one is chiefe, the rest Cease, and that's alone possest Without a Rivall Monarch of the breast. Songs in the Play. A Lover in the disguise of an Amazon, is dearly beloved of his Mistresse. Cease thou afflicted soule to mourne, Whose love and faith are paid with scorne; For I am starv'd that feele the blisses Of deare embraces, smiles, and kisses From my soules Jdoll, yet complaine Of equall love more then disdaine. Cease, Beauties exile to lament The frozen shades of banishment, For I in that faire besome dwell That is my Paradise, and Hell; Banisht at home, at once at ease In the safe Port, and tost on Seas. Cease in cold jealous feares to pine Sad wretch, whom Rivals undermine; For though I hold lockt in mine armes My lifes sole joy, a Traytors charmes Prevaile, whilst I may onely blame My selfe, that myne owne Rivall am. Another. A Lady rescued from death by a Knight, who in the instant leaves her, complaines thus. Oh whither is my fayre Sun fled, Bearing his light, not heat away? If thou repose in the moyst bed Of the Sea-Queene, bring backe the day To our darke clime, and thou shalt lye Bath'd in the sea flowes from mine eye. Upon what whirlewind didst thou ride Hence, yet remaine fixt in my heart, From me, and to me; fled, and ty'de? Darke riddles of the amorous art; Love tent thee wings to flye so Hee Vnfeather'd, now must rest with mee. Helpe, helpe, brave Youth, I burne, I bleed, The cruell God with Bow and Brand Pursues the life thy valour freed, Disarme him with thy conquering hand; And that thou mayest the wilde boy tame Give me his dart, keepe Thou his flame. To Ben. Iohnson. Vpon occasion of his Ode of defiance annext to his Play of the new Inne. Tis true (deare Ben:) thy just chastizing hand Hath fixt upon the sotted Age a brand To their swolne pride, and empty scribbling due, It can nor judge, nor write, and yet 'tis true Thy commique Muse from the exalted line Toucht by thy Alchymist, doth since decline From that her Zenith, and foretells a red And blushing evening, when she goes to bed, Yet such, as shall out-shine the glimmering light With which all stars shall guild the following night. Nor thinke it much (since all thy Eaglets may Endure the Sunnie tryall) if we say This hath the stronger wing, or that doth shine Trickt up in fairer plumes, since all are thine; Who hath his flock of cackling Geese compar'd With thy tun'd quire of Swans? or else who dar'd To call thy births deformed? but if thou bind By Citie-custome, or by Gavell-kind, In equall shares thy love on all thy race, We may distinguish of their sexe, and place; Though one hand form them, &amp; though one brain strike Soules into all, they are not all alike. Why should the follies then of this dull age Draw from thy Pen such an immodest rage As seemes to blast thy (else-immortall) Bayes, When thine owne tongue proclaimes thy ytch of praise? Such thirst will argue drouth. No, let be hurld Vpon thy workes, by the detracting world, What malice can suggest; let the Rowte say, The running sands, that (cre thou make a play) Count the slow minutes, might a Goodwin frame To swallow when th'hast done thy ship-wrackt name. Let them the deare expence of oyle upbraid Suckt by thy watchfull Lampe, that hath betray'd To theft the blood of martyr'd Authors, spilt Into thy inke, whilst thou growest pale with guile, Repine not at the Tapers thriftie waste, That sleekes thy terser Poems, nor is haste Prayse, but excuse; and if thou overcome A knottie writer, bring the bootie kome; Nor thinke it theft, if the rich spoyles so torne From conquered Authors, be as Trophies worne. Let others glut on the extorted praise Of vulgar breath, trust thou to after dayes: Thy labour'd workes shall live, when Time devoures Th'abortive off-spring of their hastie houres. Thou art not of their ranke, the quarrell lyes Within thine owne Virge, then let this suffice, The wiser world doth greater Thee confesse Then all men else, then Thy selfe onely lesse. An Hymeneall Dialogue. Bride and Groome. Groome. Tell me (my love) since Hymen ty'de The holy knot, hast thou not felt A new infused spirit slide Into thy brest, whilst thine did melt? Bride. First tell me (sweet) whose words were those? For though the voyce your ayre did breake, Yet did my soule the sence compose, And through your lips my heart did speake. Groo, Then I perceive, when from the flame Of love, my scorch'd soule did retire; Your frozen heart in her place came, And sweetly melted in that fire, Bride. 'Tis true, for when that mutuall change Of soules, was made with equall gaine; I straight might feele diffus'd a strange, But gentle he at through every veige. Chorus. Oh blest dis-union, that doth so Our bodyes from our soules divide, As two doe one, and one foure grow, Each by contraction multiply'de. Bride. Thy bosome then I'le make my nest, Since there my willing soule doth pearch. Groom. And for my heart in thy chast brest, I'le make an everlasting search. Chorus. Oh blest disunion, &amp;c. Obsequies to the Lady Anne Hay. I heard the Virgins sigh, I saw the sleeke And polisht Courtier, channell his fresh cheeke With reall teares; the new-betrothed Maid Smild not that day; the graver Senate layd Their businesse by; of all the Courtly throng, Griefe seald the heart, and silence bound the tongue. I that ne're more of private sorrow knew Then from my Pen some froward Mistresse drew And for the publike woe, had my dull sense So fear'd with ever adverse influence, As the invaders sword might have, unfelt, Pierc'd my dead bosome, yet began to melt: Griefe's strong instinct, did to my blood suggest In the unknowne losse peculiar interest. But when I heard, the noble Carlil's Gemme, The fayrest branch of Dennye's ancient stemme Was from that Casket stolne, from this Trunke torne, I found just cause, why they, why I should mourne. But who shall guide my artlesse Pen, to draw Those blooming beauties, which I never saw? How shall posteritie beleeve my story, If I, her crowded graces, and the glory Due to her riper vertues, shall relate Without the knowledge of her mortall state? Shall I, as once Apelles, here a feature, There steale a Grace, and rifling so whole Nature Of all the sweets a learned eye can see, Figure one Venus, and say, such was shee? Shall I her legend fill, with what of old Hath of the Worthies of her sex beene told, And what all pens, and times to all dispence, Restraine to her, by a prophetique sence? Or shall I, to the Morall, and Divine Exactest lawes, shape by an even line, A life so straight, as it should shame the square Left in the rules of Katherine, or Clare, And call it hers, say, so did she begin, And had she liv'd, such had her progresse been? These are dull wayes, by which base pens, for hire, Dawbe glorious vice, and from Apollo's quire Steale holy Dittyes, which prophanely they Vpon the herse of every strumpet lay, We will not bathe thy corps with a forc'd teare, Nor shall thy traine borrow the blacks they weare: Such vulgar spice, and gums, embalme not thee, Thou art the Theame of Truth, not Poetrie. Thou shalt endure a tryall by thy Peeres, Virgins of equall birth, of equall yeares, Whose vertues, held with thine an emulous strife, Shall draw thy picture, and record thy life. One shall enspheare thine eyes, another shall Impearle thy teeth; a third, thy white and small Hand, shall besnow; a fourth, incarnadine Thy rosie cheeke, untill each beauteous line, Drawne by her hand, in whom that part excells, Meet in one Center, where all beautie dwells. Others, in taske shall thy choyce vertues share, Some shall their birth, some their ripe growth declare, Though niggard Time left much unhach'd by deeds, They shall relate how thou hadst all the seeds Of every Vertue, which in the pursuit Of time, must have brought forth admired fruit, Thus shalt thou, from the mouth of envy, raise A glorious journall of thy thrifty dayes, Like a bright starre, shot from his spheare, whose race In a continued line of flames, we trace. This, if survay'd, shall to thy view impart How little more then late, thou wer't, thou art, This shall gaine credit with succeeding times, When nor by bribed pens, nor partiall times Of engag'd kindred, but the sacred truth Is storied by the partners of thy youth; Their breath shall Saint thee, and be this thy pride, Thus even by Rivals to be Deifide. To the Countesse of Anglesie upon the immorderatly-by-her-lamented death of her Husband. Madam, men say you keepe with dropping eyes Your sorrowes fresh, wat'ring the Rose that lyes Fall'n from your cheeks upon your deare Lords Hearse, Alas! those odors now no more can pierce His cold pale nosthrill, nor the crymson dye Present a gracefull blush to his darke eye. Thinke you that flood of pearly moysture hath The vertue fabled of old Ãsons bath. You may your beauties, and your youth consume Over his Vrne, and with your sighes perfume The solitarie Vault, which as you grone In hollow Ecchocs shall repeate your moane. There you may wither, and an Autumne bring Vpon your selfe, but not call back his spring. Forbeare your fruitlesse griefe then, and let those Whose love was doubted, gaine beliefe with showes To their suspected faith; you, whose whole life In every act crown'd you a constant Wife, May spare the practise of that vulgar trade, Which superstitious custome onely made; Rather a Widow now of wisedome prove The patterne, as a Wife you were of love: Yet since you surfet on your griefe, 'tis fit I tell the world, upon what cates you sit Glutting your sorrowes; and at once include His story, your excuse, my gratitude. You, that behold how yond' sad Lady blends Those ashes with her teares, lest, as she spends Her tributarie sighes, the frequent gust Might scatter up and downe the noble dust, Know when that heape of Atomes, was with bloud Kneaded to solid flesh, and firmely stood On stately Pillars, the rare forme might move The froward Juno's, or chast Cinthia's love. In motion, active grace, in rest, a calme Attractive sweetnesse, brought both wound and balme To every heart. He was compos'd of all The wishes of ripe Virgins, when they call For Hymens rites, and in their fancies wed A shape of studied beauties to their bed. Within this curious Palace dwelt a soule Gave lustre to each part, and to the whole. This drest his face in curteous smiles; and so From comely gestures, sweeter manners flow. This courage joyn'd to strength, so the hand, bent, Was valours, open'd, Bounties instrument Which did the scale, and sword, of Justice hold, Knew how to brandish steele, and scatter gold. This taught him, not to engage his modest tongue In suites of private gaine, though publike wrong; Nor mis-employ (As is the Great-mans use.) His credit with his Master, to traduce, Deprave, maligne, and ruine Innocence In proud prevenge of some mis-judg'd offence. But all his actions had the noble end T'advance desert, or grace some worthy friend. He chose not in the active streame to swim, Nor hunted Honour; which, yet hunted him. But like a quiet Eddie, that hath found Some hollow creeke, there turnes his waters round, And in continuall circles, dances free From the impetuous Torrent; so did hee Give others leave to turne the wheele of State, (Whose restlesse motions spins the subjects fate) Whilst he retir'd from the tumultuous noyse Of Court, and suitors presse; apart, enjoyes Freedome, and mirth, himselfe, his time, and friends, And with sweet rellish tastes each houre he spends. I could remember how his noble heart First kindled at your beauties, with what Art He chas'd his game through all opposing feares, When I his sighes to you, and back your teares Convay'd to him, how loyall then, and how Constant he prov'd since to his mariage vow. So as his wandring eyes never drew in One lustfull thought to tempt his soule to sinne, But that I feare such mention rather may Kindle new griefe, than blow the old away. Then let him rest joyn'd to great Buckingham, And with his brothers, mingle his bright flame, Looke up, and meet their beames, and you from thence May chance derive a chearfull influence, Seeke him no more in dust, but call agen Your scatterd beauties home, and so the pen Which now I take from this sad Elegie Shall sing the Trophies of your conquering eye. An Elegie upon the death of Doctor Donne, Deane of Pauls. Can we not force from widowed Poetrie Now thou art dead (Great Donne) one Elegie, To crowne thy Hearse? Why yet did we not trust, Though with unkneaded dow-bak'd prose, thy dust, Such as th'uncizard Lect'rer from the flower Of fading Rhet'rique, short-liv'd as his houre, Drie as the sand that measures it, might lay Vpon the ashes, on the Funerall day? Have we nor tune, nor voyce? didst thou dispence Through all our languge both the words and sence? 'Tis a sad truth. The Pulpit may her plaine, And sober Christian precepts still retaine, Doctrines it may, and wholsome uses, frame, Grave Homilies, and Lectures, but the flame Of thy brave soule, that shot such heat, and light, As burnt our Earth, and made our darknesse bright, Committed holy rapes upon the will, Did through the eye the melting heart distill. And the deepe knowledge, of darke truths, so teach As sence might judge what fancy could not reach, Must be desir'd for ever. So the fire That fills with spirit and heare the Delphique Quire, Which kindled first by thy Promethean breath Glow'd here awhile, lyes quencht now in thy death. The Muses garden, with Pedantique weedes O're-spread, was purg'd by thee, the lazie seeds Of servile imitation throwne away, And fresh invention planted; thou did'st pay The debts of our penurious banqueront Age: Licentious thefts, that make poetique rage A mimique furie, when our soules must be Possest, or with Anacreons extasie, Or Pindars, not their owne, the subtle cheate Of slie exchanges, and the jugling feate Of two-edg'd words, or whatsoever wrong By ours was done the Greeke or Latine tongue, Thou hast redeem'd, and Opened us a Mine Of rich and pregnant fancie, drawne a line Of Masculine expression, which had good Old Orpheus seene, or all the ancient brood Our superstitious fooles admire, and hold Their Leade more precious then thy burnisht gold, Thou hadst beene their Exchequer, and no more, They each in others dung had search'd for Ore. Thou shalt yeeld no precedence, but of Time, And the blind fate of Language, whose tun'd chime More charmes the outward sense; yet thou mayst claime From so great disadvantage, greater fame, Since to the awe of thy imperious wit Our trouble some language bends, made only fit With her tough thick-rib'd hoopes, to gird about Thy Gyant fancie, which had prov'd too stout For their soft melting phrases. As in time They had the start, so did they call the prime Buds of invention many a hundred yeare, And left the rifled fields, besides the feare To touch their harvest, yet from those bare lands Of what was onely thine, thy onely hands (And that their smallest worke) have gleaned more Then all those times, and Tongues, could reape before. But thou art gone, and thy strickt lawes will be Too hard for Libertines in Poetrie, They will recall the goodly exil'd ttaine: Of Gods, and Goddesses, which in thy just raigne Was banisht nobler Poems; now, with these, The silenc'd tales i'th' Metamorphoses Shall stuffe their lines, and swell the windie page Till verse refin'd by thee, in this last Age Turne Ballad-rime, or those old Idols be Ador'd againe with new Apostasie. Oh! pardon me that breake with untun'd Verse The reverend silence, that attends thy Hearse, Whose solemne, awfull Murmurs, were to thee More then these rude lines, a loude Elegie, That did proclaime in a dumbe Eloquence The death of all the Arts, whose influence Growne feeble, in these panting numbers lyes Gasping short-winded accents, and so dyes So doth the swiftly-turning wheele, not stand In th'instant we withdraw the moving hand, But some short time retaine a faint weake course, By vertue of the first impulsive force; And so, whilst I cast on thy funerall Pile, Thy crowne of Bayes, oh let it crack awhile And spit disdaine, till the devouring flashes Suck all the moysture up, then turne to ashes, I will not draw the envy, to engrosse All thy perfections, or weepe all the losse, Those are too numerous for one Elegie, And this too great to be exprest by me. Let others carve the rest; it shall suffize, I on thy Grave this Epitaph incize. Here lyes a King, that rul'd as he thought fit The Vniversall Monarchie of wit, Here lyes two Flamens, and both those the best, Apollo's first, at last the true God's Priest. In answer of an Elegiacall Letter upon the death of the King of Sweden from Aurelian Townsend, inviting me to write on that subject. Why dost thou sound, my deare Aurelian, In so shrill accents, from thy Barbican, A loude allarum to my drowsie eyes, Bidding them wake in teares and Elegies For mightie Swedens fall? Alas! how may My Lyrique feet, that of the smooth soft way Of Love, and Beautie, onely know the tread, In dancing paces celebrate the dead Victorious King, or his Majesticke Hearse Prophane with th'humble touch of their low verse? Virgil, nor Lucan, no, nor Tasso more Then both, not Donne, worth all that went before, With the united labour of their wit Could a just Poem to this subject fit, His actions were too mighty to be rais'd Higher by Verse, let him in prose be prays'd, In modest faithfull story, which his deedes Shall turne to Poems: when the next Age reades Of Frankfort, Leipsigh, Worsburgh, of the Rhyne; The Leck, the Danube, Tilly, Wallestein, Bavaria, Papenheim, Lutzenfield, where Hee Gain'd after death a posthume Victorie, They'le thinke his Acts things rather feign'd then done Like our Romances of the Knight o'th' Sun. Leave we him then to the grave Chronicler, Who though to Annals he can not refer His too-briefe storie, yet his Journals may Stand by the CÃ¦sars yeares, and every day Cut into minutes, each, shall more containe Of great designement then an Emperours raigne; And (since 'twas but his Church-yard) let him have For his owne ashes now no narrower Grave Then the whole German Continents vast wombe, Whilst all her Cities doe but make his Tombe: Let us to supreame providence commit The fate of Monarchs, which first thought it fit To rend the Empire from the Austrian graspe, And next from Swedens, even when he did claspe Within his dying armes the Soveraigntie Of all those Provinces, that men might see The Divine wisedome would not leave that Land Subject to any one Kings sole command. Then let the Germans feare if CÃ¦sar shall, Or the Vnited Princes, rise, and fall, But let us that in myrtle bowers sit Vnder secure shades, use the benefit Of peace and plenty, which the blessed hand Of our good King gives this obdurate Land, Let us of Revels sing, and let thy breath (Which fill'd Fames trumpet with Gustavus death, Blowing his name to heaven) gently inspire Thy past'rall pipe, till all our swaines admire Thy song and subject, whilst they both comprise The beauties of the SHEPHERDS PARADISE; For who like thee (whose loose discourse is farre More neate and polisht then our Poems are, Whose very gate's more gracefull then our dance) In sweetly-flowing numbers may advance The glorious night? When, not to act foule rapes, Like birds, or beasts, but in their Angel-shapes A troope of Deities came downe to guide Our steerelesse barkes in passions swelling tide By vertues Carde, and brought us from above A patterne of their owne celestiall love. Nor lay it in darke sullen precepts drown'd But with rich fancie, and cleare Action crown'd Through a misterious fable (that was drawne Like a transparant veyle of purest Lawne Before their dazelling beauties) the divine Venus, did with her heavenly Cupid shine. The stories curious web, the Masculine stile; The subtile sence, did Time and sleepe beguile, Pinnion'd and charm'd they stood to gaze upon Th'Angellike formes, gestures, and motion. To heare those ravishing sounds that did dispence Knowledge and pleasure, to the soule, and sense. It fill'd us with amazement to behold Love made all spirit, his corporeall mold Dissected into Atomes melt away To empty ayre, and from the grosse allay Of mixtures, and compounding Accidents Resin'd to immateriall Elements, But when the Queene of Beautie did inspire The ayre with perfumes, and our hearts with fire, Breathing from her celestiall Organ sweet Harmonious notes, our soules fell at her feet, And did with humble reverend dutie, more Her rare perfections, then high state adore, These harmelesse pastimes let my Townsend sing To rurall tunes; not that thy Muse wants wing To soare a loftier pitch, for she hath made A noble flight, and plac'd th'Heroique shade Above the reach of our faint flagging ryme; But these are subjects proper to our clyme. Tourneyes, Masques, Theaters, better become Our Halcyon dayes; what though the German Drum Bellow for freedome and revenge, the noyse Concernes not us, nor should divert our joyes; Nor ought the thunder of their Carabins Drowne the sweet Ayres of our tun'd Violins; Beleeve me friend, if their prevailing powers Gaine them a calme securitie like ours, They'le hang their Armes up on the Olive bough, And dance, and revell then, as we doe now. Vpon Master W. Mountague his returne from travell. Leade the black Bull to slaughter, with the Bore And Lambe, then purple with their mingled gore The Oceans curled brow, that so we may The Sea-Gods for their carefull waftage pay: Send gratefull Incense up in pious smoake To those mild spirits, that cast a curbing yoake Vpon the stubborne winds, that calmely blew To the wisht shore, our long'd for Mountague. Then whilst the Aromatique odours burne, In honour of their Darling's safe returne; The Muses Quire shall thus with voyce and hand, Blesse the fayre Gale that drove his ship to land. Sweetly breathing Vernall Ayre, That with kind warmth doest repayre Wintere raines, from whose brest All the gums, and spice of th'East Borrow their perfumes, whose eye Guilds the morne, and cleares the skie, Whose disheveld tresses shed Pearles upon the Violet bed, On whose brow with calme smiles drest The Halcions fits and builds her nest. Beautie, Youth, and endlesse spring, Dwell upon thy rosie wing. Thou, if stormie Boreas throwes Downe whole Forrest when he blowes, With a pregnant flowery birth Ganst refresh the teeming Earth; If he nip the early bud, If he blast what's faire or good; If he scatter our choyce flowers, If she shake our hills or bowers, If his rude breath threaten us, Thou canst stroake great Ãolus, And from him the grace obtaine To binde him in an Iron chaine. Thus, whilst you deale your body 'mongst your friends, And fill their circling armes, my glad soule sends This her embrace: Thus we of Delphos greet As Lay-men claspe their hands, we joyne our feet. To Master W. Mountague. Sir, I arest you at your Countreyes suit, Who as a debt to her, requires the fruit Of that rich stock; which she by Natures hand Gave you in trust, to th'use of this whole Land. Next, she endites you of a Felonie, For stealing, what was her Proprietie. Your selfe from hence, so seeking to convey The publike treasure of the state away. More, y'are accus'd of Ostracisme, the Fate Impos'd of old by the Athenian state On eminent vertue, but that curse which they Cast on their men, You on your Countrey lay. For, thus divided from your noble parts This Kingdome lives in exile, and all hearts That rellish worth, or honour, being rent From your perfections, suffer banishment: These are your publike injuries; but I Have a just private quarrell to defie And call you Coward, thus to run away When you had pierc'd my heart, not daring stay Till I redeem'd my honour; but I sweare By Celia's eyes, by the same force to teare Your heart from you, or not to end this strife Till I or find revenge, or lose my life. But as in single fights it oft hath beene In that unequall equall tryall seene, That he who had receiv'd the wrong at first, Came from the Combat oft too with the worst; So if you foyle me when we meet, I'le then Give you fayre leave to wound me so agen. On the Mariage of T.K. and C.C. the morning stormie. Svch should this day be, so the Sun should hide His bashfull face, and let the conquering Bride Without a Rivall shine, whilst He forbeares To mingle his unequall beames with hers; Or if sometimes he glance his squinting eye Betweene the parting cloudes, 'tis but to spye, Not emulate her glories, so comes drest In vayles, but as a Masquer to the feast. Thus heaven should lower, such stormy gusts should blow Not to denounce ungentle Fates, but show The cheerefull Bridegroome to the clouds and wind Hath all his teares, and all his sighes assign'd. Let Tempests struggle in the Ayre, but rest Eternall calmes within thy peacefull brest. Thrice happy Youth; but ever sacrifice To that fayre hand that dry'de thy blubbred eyes, That cround thy head with Roses, and turn'd all The plagues of love into a cordiall, When first joyn'd her Virgin snow to thine, Which when to day the Priest shall recombine, From the misterious holy touch such charmes Will flow, as shall unlock her wreathed armes, And open a free passage to that fruit Which thou hast toyl'd for with a long pursuit. But ere thou feed, that thou may'st better taste Thy present joyes, thinke on thy torments past. Thinke on the mercy freed thee, thinke upon Her vertues, graces, beauties, one by one, So shalt thou relish all, enjoy the whole Delights of her faire body, and pure foule. Then boldly to the fight of Love proceed, Tis mercy not to pitty though she bleed, Wee'le strew no nuts, but change that ancient forme, For till to morrow wee'le prorogue this storme. Which shall confound with its loude whistling noyse Her pleasing shreekes, and fan thy panting joyes. For a Picture where a Queen Laments over the Tombe of a slaine Knight. Brave Youth; to whom Fate in one hower Grave death, and Conquest, by whose power Those chaines about my heart are wound, With which the Foe my Kingdome bound, Freed, and captiv'd by thee, I bring For either Act an offering; For victory, this wreathe of Bay: In signe of Thraldome, downe I lay Scepter and Crowne: Take from my sight Those Royall Robes; since fortunes spight Forbids me live thy Vertues prize, I'le dye thy Valours sacrifice. To a Lady that desired I would love her. 1 Now you have freely given me leave to love, What will you doe? Shall I your mirth, or passion move When I begin to wooe; Will you torment, or scorne, or love me too? 2 Each pettie beautie can disdaine, and I Spight of your hate Without your leave can see, and dye; Dispence a nobler Fate, 'Tis easie to destroy, you may create. 3 Then give me leave to love, and love me too Not with designe To rayse, as Loves curst Rebells doe; When puling Poets whine, Fame to their beautie, from their blubbr'd eyne. 4 Griefe is a puddle, and reflects not cleare Your beauties rayes, Joyes are pure streames, your eyes appeare Sullen in sadder layes, In chearfull numbers they shine bright with prayse. 5 Which shall not mention to expresse you fayre Wounds, flames, and darts, Stormes in your brow, nets in your haire, Suborning all your parts, Or to betray, or torture captive hearts. 6 I'le make your eyes like morning Suns appeare, As milde, and faire Your brow as Crystall smooth, and cleare, And your dishevell'd hayre Shall flow like a calme Region of the Ayre. 7 Rich Natures store, (which is the Poets Treasure) I'le spend, to dresse Your beauties, if your mine of Pleasure In equall thankfulnesse You but unlocke, so we each other blesse. Upon my Lord Chiefe Iustice his election of my Lady A.W. for his Mistresse. 1 Heare this, and tremble all Vsurping Beauties, that create A government Tyrannicall In Loves free state, Justice, hath to the sword of your edg'd eyes His equall ballance joyn'd, his sage head lyes In Loves soft lap, which must be just and wise. 2 Harke how the sterne Law breathes Forth amorous sighs, and now prepares No fetters, but of silken wreathes, And, braded hayres; His dreadfull Rods and Axes are exil'd Whilst he sits crown'd with Roses, Love hath fil'de His native roughnesse, Justice is growne milde, 3 The golden Age returnes, Loves bowe, and quiver, uselesse lye, His shaft, his brand, nor wounds, nor burnes, And crueltie Is sunke to Hell, the fayre shall all be kind, Who loves, shall be belov'd, the froward mind To a deformed shape shall be confin'd. 4 AstrÃ¦a hath possest An earthly seate, and now remaines In Finches heart, but Wentworths brest That Guest containes; With her she dwells, yet hath not left the skies, Nor lost her Spheare, for, new-enthron'd she cryes I know no Heaven but fayre Wentworths eyes. To A.D. unreasonable distrustfull of her owne beauty. Fayre Doris breake thy Glasse, it hath perplext With a darke Comment, beauties clearest Text, It hath not told thy faces story true, But brought false Copies to thy jealous view. No colour, feature, lovely ayre, or grace, That ever yet adorn'd a beauteous face, But thou maist reade in thine, or justly doubt Thy Glasse hath beene suborn'd to leave it out, But if it offer to thy nice survey A spot, a staine, a blemish, or decay, It not belongs to thee, the treacherous light Or faithlesse stone abuse thy credulous sight. Perhaps the magique of thy face, hath wrought Vpon th'enchanted Crystall, and so brought Fantasticke shadowes to delude thine eyes With ayrie repercussive sorceries. Or else th'enamoured Image pines away For love of the fayre Object, and so may Waxe pale and wan, and though the substance grow Lively and fresh, that may consume with woe; Give then no faith to the false specular stone, But let thy beauties by th'effects be knowne: Looke (sweetest Doris) on my love-sick heart, In that true mirrour see how fayre thou art. There, by Loves never-erring Pensill drawne Shalt thou behold thy face, like th'early dawne Shoot through the shadie covert of thy hayre, Enameling, and perfuming the calme Ayre With Pearles, and Roses, till thy Suns display Their lids, and let out the imprison'd day. Whilst Delfique Priests, (enlightned by their Theame) In amorous numbers count thy golden beame, And from Loves Altars cloudes of sighes arise In smoaking Incence to adore thine eyes. If then Love flow from Beautie as th'effect How canst thou the resistlesse cause suspect? Who would not brand that Foole, that should contend There were no fire, where smoke and flames ascend? Distrust is worse then scorne, not to beleeve My harmes, is greater wrong then not to grieve; What cure can for my festring sore be found, Whilst thou beleev'st thy beautie cannot wound? Such humble thoughts more cruell Tyrants prove Then all the pride that e're usurp'd in Love, For Beauties Herald, here denounceth war, There her false spies betray me to a snare. If fire disguis'd in balls of snow were hurl'd It unsuspected might consume the world; Where our prevention ends, danger begins, So Wolves in Sheepes, Lyons in Asses skins, Might farre more mischiefe worke, because lesse fear'd Those, the whole flock, these, might kill all the herd, Appeare then as thou art, break through this cloude Confesse thy beauty, though thou thence grow proud, Be faire though scornfull, rather let me find Thee cruell, then thus mild, and more unkind; Thy crueltie doth only me defie, But these dull thoughts thee to thy selfe denie. Whether thou meane to bartar, or bestow Thyselfe; 'tis fit thou thine owne valew know? I will not cheate thee of thy selfe, nor pay Lesse for thee then th'art worth, thou shalt not say That is but brittle glasse, which I have found By strict enquirie a firme Diamond. I'le trade with no such Indian foole as sells Gold, Pearles, and pretious stones, for Beads and Bells Nor will I take a present from your hand, Which you or prize not, or not understand; It not endeares your bountie that I doe Esteeme your gift, unlesse you doe so too; You undervalew me, when you bestow On me, what you nor care for, nor yet know. No (Lovely Doris) change thy thoughts, and be In love first with thy selfe, and then with me. You are afflicted that you are not faire, And I as much tormented that you are, What I admire, you scorne; what I love, hate, Through different faiths, both share an equall Fate, Fast to the truth, which you renounce, I stick, I dye a Martyr, you an Heretique. To my friend G.N. from Wrest. I breathe (sweet Ghib:) the temperate ayre of Wrest Where I no more with raging stormes opprest, Weare the cold nights out by the bankes of Tweed, On the bleake Mountains, where fierce tempests breed, And everlasting Winter dwells; where milde Favonius, and the Vernall windes exilde, Did never spread their wings: but the wilde North Brings sterill Fearne, Thistles, and Brambles forth. Here steep'd in balmic dew, the pregnant Earth, Sends from her teeming wombe a flowrie birth, And cherisht with the warme Suns quickning heate, Her porous bosome doth rich odours sweate; Whose perfumes through the Ambient ayre diffuse Such native Aromatiques, as we use No forraigne Gums, nor essence fetcht from farre, Vo Volatile spirits, nor compounds that are Adulterate, but at Natures cheape expence With farre more genuine sweetes refresh the sense. Such pure and uncompounded beauties, blesse This Mansion with an usefull comelinesse. Devoide of Art, for here the Architect Did not with curious skill a Pile erect Of carved Marble, Touch, or Porpherie, But built a house for hospitalitie; No sumptuous Chimney-peece of shining stone Invites the strangers eye to gaze upon, And coldly entertaines his sight, but cleare And cheerefull flames, cherish and warme him here: No Dorique, nor Corinthian Pillars grace With Imagery this structures naked face. The Lord and Lady of this place delight Rather to be in act, then seeme in sight; In stead of Statues to adorne their wall They throng with living men, their merry Hall, Where at large Tables fill'd with wholsome meates The servant, Tennant, and kind neighbour eates. Some of that ranke, spun of a finer thred Are with the Women, Steward, and Chaplaine fed With daintier cates; Others of better note Whom wealth, parts, office, or the Heralds coate Have sever'd from the common, freely sit At the Lords Table, whose spread sides admit A large accesse of friends to fill those seates Of his capacious sickle, fill'd with meates Of choycest rellish, till his Oaken back Vnder the load of pil'd-up dishes crack. Nor thinke, because our Piramids, and high Exalted Turrets threaten not the skie, That therefore Wrest of narrownesse complaines Or streightned Walls, for she more numerous traines: Of Noble guests daily receives, and those Can with farre more conveniencie dispose Then prouder Piles, where the vaine builder spent More cost in outward gay Embellishment Then reall use: which was the sole designe Of our contriver, who made things not fine, But fit for service Amalthea's Horne Of plentie is not in Effigie worne Without the gate, but she within the dore Empties her free and unexhausted store. Nor, croun'd with wheaten wreathes, doth Ceres stand In stone, with a crook'd circle in her hand: Nor, on a Marble Tunne, his face besmear'd With grapes, is curl'd uncizard Bacchus rear'd. We offer not in Emblemes to the eyes, But to the taste those usefull Deities. Wee presse the juycie God, and quaffe his blood, And grinde the Yeallow Goddesse into food. Yet we decline not, all the worke of Art, But where more bounteous Nature beares a part And guides her Hand-maid, if she but dispence Fit matter, she with care and diligence Employes her skill, for where the neighbour sourse Powers forth her waters she directs their course, And entertaines the flowing streames in deepe And spacious channells, where they slowly creepe In snakie windings, as the shelving ground Leades them in circles, till they twice surround This Island Mansion, which i'th' center plac'd, Is with a double Crystall heaven embrac'd, In which our watery constellations floate, Our Fishes, Swans, our Water-man and Boate, Envy'd by those above, which wish to slake Their starre-burnt limbes, in our refreshing lake, But they stick fast nayl'd to the barren Spheare, Whilst our encrease in fertile waters here Disport, and wander freely where they please Within the circuit of our narrow Seas. With various Trees we fringe the waters brinke, Whose thirstie rootes the soaking moysture drinke. And whose extended boughes in equall rankes Yeeld fruit, and shade, and beautie to the bankes. On this side young Vertumnus sits, and courts His ruddie-cheek'd Pomona. Zephyre sports On th'other, with lov'd Flora, yeelding there Sweetes for the smell, sweetes for the palate here. But did you taste the high &amp; mighty drinke Which from that Fountaine flowes, you'ld cleerly think The God of Wine did his plumpe clusters bring, And crush the Falerne grape into our spring; Or else disguis'd in watery Robes did swim To Ceres bed, and make her big of Him, Begetting so himselfe on Her: for know Our Vintage here in March doth nothing owe To theirs in Autumne, but our fire boyles here As lustie liquour as the Sun makes there. Thus I enjoy my selfe, and taste the fruit Of this blest Peace, whilst toyl'd in the pursuit Of Bucks, and Stags, th'embleme of warre you strive To keepe the memory of our Armes alive. A New-yeares gift. To the King. Looke back old Janus, and survey From Times birth, till this new-borne day, All the successfull season bound With Lawrell wreathes, and Trophies crown'd; Turne o're the Annals past, and where Happie auspitious dayes appeare, Mark'd with the whiter stone, that cast On the darke brow of th'Ages past A dazeling luster, let them shine In this succeeding circles twine, Till it be round with glories spread, Then with it crowne our Charles his head, That we th'ensuing yeare may call One great continued festivall. Fresh joyes in varied formes apply, To each distinct captivitie. Season his cares by day with nights Crown'd with all conjugall delights, May the choyce beauties that enflame His Royall brest be still the same, And he still thinke them such, since more Thou canst not give from Natures store. Then as a Father let him be With numerous issue blest, and see The faire and God-like off-spring growne From budding starres to Suns full blowne. Circle with peacefull Olive bowes, And conquering Bayes, his Regall browes. Let his strong vertues overcome, And bring him bloodlesse Trophies home: Strew all the pavements, where he treads With loyall hearts, or Rebels heads; But Byfront, open thou no more, In his blest raigne the Temple dore. To the Queene. Thou great Commandresse, that doest move Thy Scepter o're the Crowne of Love, And through his Empire with the Awe Of Thy chaste beames, doest give the Law. From his prophaner Altars, we Turne to adore Thy Deitie: He, only can wilde lust provoke, Thou, those impurer flames canst choke; And where he scatters looser fires, Thou turn'st them into chast desires: His Kingdome knowes no rule but this, What ever pleaseth lawfull is; Thy sacred Lore shewes us the path Of Modestie, and constant faith, Which makes the rude Male satisfied With one faire Female by his side; Doth either sex to each unite, And forme loves pure Hermophradite. To this Thy faith behold the wilde Satyr already reconciled. Who from the influence of Thine eye Hath suckt the deepe Divinitie; O free them then, that they may teach, The Centaur, and the Horsman preach To Beasts and Birds, sweetly to rest Each in his proper Lare and nest: They shall convey it to the floud, Till there Thy law be understood. So shalt thou with thy pregnant fire, The water, earth, and ayre, inspire. To the New-yeare for the Countesse of Carlile. Give Lucinda Pearle, nor Stone, Lend them light who else have none, Let Her beautis shine alone. Gums nor spice bring from the East, For the Phenix in Her brest Builds his funerall pile, and nest. No tyre thou canst invent, Shall to grace her forme be sent, She adornes all ornament. Give Her nothing, but restore Those sweet smiles which heretofore, In Her chearfull eyes she wore. Drive those envious cloudes away, Vailes that have o're-cast my day, And ecclips'd Her brighter ray. Let the royall Goth mowe downe This yeares harvest with his owne Sword, and spare Lucinda's frowne. Janus, if when next I trace Those sweet lines, I in her face Reade the Charter of my grace, Then from bright Apollo's tree, Such a Garland wreath'd shall be, As shall Crowne both Her and thee. To my Honoured friend, Master Thomas May, upon his Comedie, The Heire. The Heire being borne, was in his tender age Rockt in the Cradle of a private Stage, Where lifted up by many a willing hand, The child did from the first day fairely stand. Since having gather'd strength, he dares preferre His steps into the publike Theater The World: where he dispaires not but to find A doome from men more able, not lesse kind; I but his Vsher am, yet if my word May passe, I dare be bound he will afford Things must deserve a welcome, if well knowne Such as best writers would have wisht their owne. You shall observe his words in order meet, And softly stealing on with equall feet Slide into even numbers, with such grace As each word had beene moulded for that place. You shall perceive an amorous passion, spunne Into so smooth a web, as had the Sunne When he pursu'd the swiftly flying Maid, Courted her in such language, she had staid, A love so well exprest, must be the same The Authour felt himselfe from his faire flame: The whole plot doth alike it selfe disclose Through the five Acts, as doth the Locke that goes With letters, for till every one be knowne, The Lock's as fast, as if you had found none. And where his sportive Muse doth draw a thread Of mirth, chast Matrons may not blush to reade. Thus have I thought it fitter to reveale My want of art (deare friend) then to conceale My love. It did appeare I did not meane So to commend thy well-wrought Comick-scene, As men might judge my aime rather to be, To gaine praise to my selfe, then give it thee; Though I can give thee none, but what thou hast Deserv'd, and what must my faint breath out-last. Yet was this garment (though I skillesse be To take thy measure) onely made for thee, And if it prove to scant, 'tis cause the stuffe Nature allow'd me was not large enough. To my worthy friend Master Geo. Sands, on his translation of the Psalmes. I presse not to the Quire, nor dare I greet The holy place with my unhallowed feet; My unwasht Muse, polutes not things Divine, Nor mingles her prophaner notes with thine; Here, humbly at the porch she stayes, And with glad eares sucks in thy sacred layes. So, devout penitents of Old were wont, Some without dore, and some beneath the Font, To stand and heare the Churches Liturgies, Yet not assist the solemne exercise: Sufficeth her, that she a lay-place gaine, To trim thy Vestments, or but beare thy traine; Though nor in tune, nor wing, she reach thy Larke, Her Lyrick feet may dance before the Arke. Who knowes, but that her wandring eyes that run, Now hunting Glow-wormes, may adore the Sun, A pure flame may, shot by Almighty power Into her brest, the earthy flame devoure. My eyes, in penitentiall dew may steepe That brine, which they for sensuall love did weepe, So (though 'gainst Natures course) fire may be quencht With fire, and water be with water drencht; Perhaps my restlesse soule, tyr'de with persuit Of mortall beauty, seeking without fruit Contentment there, which hath not, when enjoy'd, Quencht all her thirst, nor satisfi'd, though cloy'd; Weary of her vaine search below, Above In the first faire may find th'immortall Love. Prompted by thy example then, no more In moulds of clay will I my God adore; But teare those Idols from my heart, and write What his blest Sprit, not fond Love shall indite; Then, I no more shall court the verdant Bay, But the dry leavelesse Trunke on Golgotha; And rather strive to gaine from thence one Thorne, Then all the flourishing wreathes by Laureats worne. To my much honoured friend, Henry Lord Cary of Lepington, upon his translation of Malvezzi. My Lord, In every triviall worke 'tis knowne Translators must be masters of their owne, And of their Authors language, but your taske A greater latitude of skill did aske. For your Malvezzi first requir'd a man To teach him speake vulgar Italian: His matter's so sublime, so now his phrase, So farre above the stile of Bemboe's dayes; Old Varchies rules, or what the Grusca yet For currant Tuscan mintage will admit, As I beleeve your Marquesse, by a good Part of his Natives hardly understood. You must expect no happier fate, tis true He is of noble birth, of nobler you: So nor your thoughts, nor words fit common eares, He writes, and you translate, both to your Peeres. To my worthy Friend, M. D'avenant, Vpon his Excellent Play, The Iust Italian. I'le not mispend in praise, the narrow roome I borrow in this leafe; the Garlands bloome From thine owne seedes, that crowne each glorious page Of thy triumphant worke; the sullen Age Requires a Satyre. What starre guides the soule Of these our froward times, that dare controule, Yet dare not learne to judge? When didst thou flie From hence, cleare, candid Ingenuitie? I have beheld, when pearch'd on the smooth brow Of a faire modest troope, thou didst allow Applause to slighter workes; but then the weake Spectator, gave the knowing leave to speake. Now noyse prevailes, and he is tax'd for drowth Of wit, that with the crie, spends not his mouth. Yet aske him, reason why he did not like; Him, why he did; their ignorance will strike Thy soule with scorne, and Pity: marke the places Provoke their smiles, frownes, or distorted faces, When, they admire, nod, shake the head; they'le be A scene of myrth, a double Comedie. But thy strong fancies (raptures of the braine, Drest in Poetique flames) they entertaine As a bold, impious reach; for they'le still slight All that exceeds Red Bull, and Cockpit flight. These are the men in crowded heape that throng To that adulterate stage, where not a tong Of th'untun'd Kennell, can a line repeat Of serious sence: but like lips, meet like meat; Whilst the true brood of Actors, that alone Keepe naturall unstrain'd Action in her throne Behold their Benches bare, though they rehearse The terser Beaumonts or great Johnsons verse. Repine not Thou then, since this churlish fate Rules not the stage alone; perhaps the State Hath felt this rancour, where men great and good, Have by the Rabble beene misunderstood. So was thy Play; whose cleere, yet loftie straine, Wisemen, that governe Fate, shall entertaine. To the Reader of Master William Davenant's Play. It hath beene said of old, that Playes are Feasts, Poets the Cookes, and the Spectators Guests, The Actors Waitors: From this Similie, Some have deriv'd an unsafe libertie To use their Judgements as their Tastes, which chuse Without controule, this Dish, and that refuse: But Wit allowes not this large Priviledge, Either you must confesse, or feele it's edge; Nor shall you make a currant inference If you trans-fer your reason to your sense: Things are distinct, and must the same appeare To every piercing Eye, or well-tun'd Eare. Though sweets with yours, sharps best with my tast mee: Both must agree, this meat's, or sharpe or sweet: But if I sent a stench, or a perfume, Whilst you smell nought at all, I may presume You have that sense imperfect: So you may Affect a sad, merry, or humerous Play, If, though the kind distaste or please, the Good And Bad, be by your Judgement understood; But if, as in this Play, where with delight I feast my Epicure an appetite With rellishes so curious, as dispence The utmost pleasure to the ravisht sense, You should professe that you can nothing meet That hits your taste, either with sharpe or sweet, But cry out, 'tis insipid; your bold Tongue May doe it's Master, not the Author wrong; For Men of better Pallat will by it Take the just elevation of your Wit. TO MY FRIEND, Will. D'avenant. I crowded 'mongst the first, to see the Stage (Inspir'd by thee) strike wonder in our age, By thy bright fancie dazled. Where each Sceane Wrought like a charme, and forc't the audience leane To th'passion of thy Pen, thence Ladyes went (Whose absence Lovers sigh'd for) to repent Their unkind scorne; And Courtiers, who by art Made love before, with a converted heart, To wed those Virgins, whom they woo'd t'abuse; Both rendred Hymen's pros'lits by thy Muse. But others who were proofe 'gainst Love, did sit To learne the subtle Dictats of thy Wit; And as each profited, tooke his degree, Master, or Batchelor, in Comedie. Wee, of th'adult'rate mixture not complaine, But thence more Characters of Vertue gaine; More pregnant Patternes, of transcendent Worth, Than barren and insipid Truth brings forth: So, oft the Bastard nobler fortune meets, Than the dull Issue of the lawfull sheets. The Comparison. Dearest thy tresses are not threads of gold, Thy eyes of Diamonds, nor doe I hold Thy lips for Rubies: Thy faire cheekes to be Fresh Roses; or thy teeth of Ivorie: Thy skin that doth thy daintie bodie sheath Not Alablaster is, nor dost thou breath Arabian odours, those the earth brings forth Compar'd with which would but impaire thy worth. Such may be others Mistresses, but mine Holds nothing earthly, but is all divine. Thy tresses are those rayes that doe arise Not from one Sunne, but two; Such are thy eyes: Thy lips congealed Nectar are, and such As but a Deitie, there's none dare touch. The perfect crimson that thy cheeke doth cloath (But onely that it farre exceeds them both) Aurora's blush resembles, or that redd That Iris-struts in when her mantl's spred, Thy teeth in white doe Leda's Swan exceede, Thy skin's a heavenly and immortall weede And thou when breath'st, the winds are readie strait To filch it from thee, and doe therefore wait Close at thy lips, and snatching it from thence Beare it to Heaven, where 'tis Joves frankincense. Faire Goddesse since thy feature makes thee one Yet be not such for these respects alone. But as you are divine in outward view So be within as faire, as good, as true. The Enquiry. Amongst the myrtles as I walk't, Love and my sighes thus intertalk't, Tell me (said I in deepe distresse) Where may I find my shepheardesse? Thou foole (said love) knowst thou not this In every thing that's good shee is; In yonder tulip goe and seeke, There thou maist find her lip, her cheeke. In you ennammel'd pausie by, There thou shalt have her curious eye; In bloome of peach, in rosie bud, There wave the streamers of her blood, In brightest lillies that there stands, The emblems of her whiter hands. In yonder rising hill there smells Such sweets as in her bosome dwells. 'Tis true (said I) and thereupon I went to plucke them one by one To make of parts a vnion But on a suddaine all was gone. With that I stopt said love these be, (Fond man) resemblances of thee, And as these flowres, thy joyes shall die Even in the twinkling of an eye. And all thy hopes of her shall wither, Like these short sweets, thus knit together. The Sparke. My first love whom all beauties did adorne: Firing my heart supprest it with her scorne, Sun-like to tinder in my brest it lies, By every sparkle made a sacrifice. Each wanton eye now kindles my desire, And that is free to all that was entire: Desiring more, by thee (desire) I lost, As those that in consumptions hunger most, And now my wandring thoughts are not confind, Vnto one woman, but to woman kinde. This for her shape of love, that for her face, This for her gesture, or some other grace, And where I none of these doe use to find, I choose thereby the kernell not the rynd: And so I hope since my first hopes are gone, To find in many what I lost in one, And like to Merchants after some great losse, Trade by retaile, that cannot now ingrosse, The fault is hers that made me goe astray, He needs must wander that hath lost his way. Guiltlesse I am shee did this change provoke, And made that charcoale which to her was oake, And as a looking glasse from the aspect, Whilst it is whole, doth but one face reflect, But being crack't, or broken there are showne, Many halfe faces, which at first were one. So love vnto my heart did first proffer Her image, and there planted none but her, But since t'was broke and martird by her scorne, Many lesse faces in her face are borne, Thus like to tynder am I prone to catch Each falling sparkle, fit for any match. The Complement. O my deerest I shall grieve thee When I sweare, yet sweete beleeve me, By thine eyes the tempting booke On which even crabbed old men looke I sweare to thee, (though none abhorre them) Yet I doe not love thee for them. I doe not love thee for that faire, Rich fanne of thy most curious haire; Though the wires thereof be drawne Finer then the threeds of lawne, And are softer then the leaves On which the subtle spinner weaues I doe not love thee for those flowers, Growing on thy cheeks (loves bowers) Though such cunning them hath spread None can paint them whit and red: Loves golden arrowes thence are shot, Yet for them I loue thee not I doe not love thee for those soft, Red corrall lips I've kist so oft; Nor teeth of pearle, the double guard. To speech, whence musicke still is heard: Though from those lips a kisse being taken, Might tyrants melt and death awaken. I doe not love thee (Ã´ my fairest) For that richest, for that rarest Silver pillar which stands vnder Thy sound head, that globe of wonder; Though that neeke be whiter farre, Then towers of pollisht Ivory are. I doe not love thee for those mountaines Hill'd with snow, whence milkey fountaines, (Suger'd sweets, as sirropt berries) Must one day run through pipes of cherries; Ã´ how much those breasts doe move me, Yet for them I doe not love thee: I doe not love thee for that belly, Sleeke as satten, soft as jelly Though within that Christall round Heapes of treasure might be found, So rich that for the best of them, A King might leave his Diadem. I doe not love thee for those thighes, Whose Alablaster rocks doe use So high and even that they stand Like Sea-markes to some happy land. Happy are those eyes have seene them, More happy they that saile betweene them. I love thee not for thy moist palme, Though the dew thereof be balme: Nor for thy pretty legge and foote, Although it be the precious roote, On which this goodly cedar growes, (Sweete) I love thee not for those. Nor for thy wit though pure and quicke, Whose substance no arithmeticke Can number downe: nor for those charmes Mask't in thy embracing armes. Though in them one night to lie, Dearest I would gladly die I love not for those eyes, nor haire, Nor cheekes, nor lips, nor teeth so rare. Nor for thy speech, thy necke, nor breast, Nor for thy belly, nor the rest: Nor for thy hand, nor foote so small, But wouldst thou know (deere sweet) for all. On sight of a Gentlewomans face in the water. Stand still you floods doe not deface, That Image which you beare: So Votaries from every place, To you shall Alters reare. No winds but Lovers sighs blow here, To trouble these glad streames, On which no starre from any Spheare, Did ever dart such beames. To Christall then in hast congeale, Least you should loose your blisse: And to my cruell faire reveale, How cold, how hard she is. But if the envious Nymphes shall feare, Their beauties will be scorn'd, And hire the ruder winds to teare, That face which you adorn'd. Then rage and foame amaine that we, Their malice may despise: When from your froath we soone shall see, A second Venus rise. A Song. [Aske me no more where Iove bestowes] Aske me no more where Iove bestowes, When Iune is past the fading rose: For in your beauties orient deepe, These flowers as in their causes, steepe. Aske me no more whether doth stray, The golden Atomes of the day: For in pure love heaven did prepare, Those powders to inrich your haire. Aske me no more whether doth hast, The Nightingale when May is past: For in your sweet dividing throat, She winters and keepes warme her note. Aske me no more where those starres light, That downewards fall in dead of night: For in your eyes they sit and there, Fixed become as in their sphere. Aske me no more if East or West, The Phenix builds her spicy nest: For vnto you at last shee flies, And in your fragrant bosome dyes. Song. [Would you know what's soft? I dare] Would you know what's soft? I dare, Not bring you to the downe, or aire: Nor to starres to shew what's bright, Nor to snow to teach you white. Nor if you would Musicke heare, Call the orbes to take your care: Nor to please your sence bring forth, Bruised Nard or what's more worth. Or on food were your thoughts plac't, Bring you Nectar, for a tast: Would you have all these in one, Name my mistris, and 'tis done. The second Rapture. No worldling, no, tis not thy gold, Which thou dost use but to behold; Nor fortune, honour, nor long life, Children, or friends, nor a good wife, That makes thee haypy; these things be But shaddowes of felicitie. Give me a wench about thirteene, Already voted to the Queene Of lust and lovers, whose soft haire, Fann'd with the breath of gentle aire O're spreads her shoulders like a tent, And is her vaile and ornament: Whose tender touch, will make the blood Wild in the aged, and the good. Whose kisses fastned to the mouth, Of threescore yeares and longer slouth. Renew the age, and whose bright eye, Obscure those lesser lights of skie. Whose snowy breasts (if we may call That snow, that never melts at all) Makes Jove invent a new disguise, In spite of Iunoes jealousies: Whose every part doth re-invite, The old decayed appetite: And in whose sweet imbraces I, May melt myselfe to lust, and die. This is true blisse, and I confesse, There is no other happinesse. The Hue and Cry. In loves name you are charg'd hereby, To make a speedy Hue and Crie, After a face which t'other day, Stole my wandring heart away. To direct you these (in briefe,) Are ready markes to know the theife. Her haire a net of beames would prove, Strong enough to captive Jove In his Eagles shape; Her brow, Is a comely field of snow. Her eye so rich, so pure a grey, Every beame creates a day. And if she but sleepe (not when The sun sers) 'tis night agen. In her cheekes are' to be seene, Of flowers both the King and Queene, Thither by the graces led, And freshly laid in nuptiall bed. On whom lips like Nymphes doe waite, Who deplore their virgin state, Oft they blush, and blush for this, That they one another kisse, But observe besides the rest, You shall know this Fellon best, By her tongue, for if your eare Once a heavenly musicke heare, Such as neither Gods nor Men, But from that voice, shall heare agen That that is she. O strait surprise, And bring her unto loves Assize? If you let her goe she may, Antedate the latter day, Fate and Philosophy controle, And leave the world without a soule. To his Mistris confined. Song. O thinke not PhÅbe 'cause a cloud, Doth now thy silver brightnes shrowd, My wandring eye Can stoope to common beauties of the Skye. Rather be kind, and this Ecclips. Shall neither binder eye nor lips, For wee shall meete, Within our hearts and kisse, and none shall see't. Nor canst thou in thy prison be, Without some living signe of me; When thou dost spye, A Sun beame peepe into the roome, 'tis J. For I am bid within a flame, And thus into thy chamber came, To let thee see, In what a mart tyredome I burne for thee. When thou dost touch thy Lute thou mayest, Thinke on my heart, on which thou plaiest; When each sad tone, Vpon the strings doth shew my deeper groane. When thou dost please, they shall rebound, With nimble ayres strucke to the sound, Of thy owne voyce; O thinke how much I tremble and reioyce. There's no sad picture that doth dwell, Vpon thy Arras wall, but well Resembles me, No matter though our age doe not agree. Love can make old, as well as time, And he that doth but twenty clime, If he dare proue, As true as I, shewes fourescore yeares in love. The Primrose. Aske me why I send you here, This firstling of the infant veare: Aske me why I send to you, This Primrose all bepearl'd with dew. I strait will whisper in your eares, The sweets of love are wash't with teares. Aske me why this flower doth shew, So yellow greene and sickly too: Aske me why the stalke is weake; And bending yet it doth not breake; I must tell you these discover, What doubts and feares are in a lover. The tinder. Of what mould did nature frame me? Or was it her intent to shame me, That no woman can come neere me Faire, but her I court to heare me? Sure that mistris to whose beauty. First I paid a lovers duty. Burnt in rage my heart to tinder. That nor prayers, nor teares can hinder. But where ever I doe turne me, Every sparke let fall doth burne me. Women since you thus inflame me, Flint and steele Il'e ever name yee. A Song. [In her faire cheekes two pits doe lye] In her faire cheekes two pits doe lye, To bury those slaine by her eye, So spight of death this comforts me, That fairely buried I shall be. My grave with rose and lilly spread, O 'tis a life to be so dead. Come then and kill me with thy eye, For if thou let me live, I die. When I behold those lips againe; Reviving what those eyes have slaine, With kisses sweet, whose balsome pure, Loves wounds as soone as made, can cure. Me thinkes 'tis sickenes to be sound, And there's no health to such a wound. Come then &amp;c. When in her chaste breast I behold, Those downy mounts of snow ne're cold, And those blest hearts her beauty kills, Reviv'd by climing those faire hills. Mee thinkes there's life in such a death, And so t'expire, inspires new breath. Come then, &amp;c. Nymphe since no death is deadly where. Such choice of Antidotes are neere, And your keene eyes but kill in vaine, Those that are sound, as soone as slaine, That I no longer dead survive, Your way's to bury me alive Jn Cupids cave, where happy J, May dying live, and living die. Come then and kill me with thy eye, For if thou let me live, I die. The Carver. To his Mistris. A Carver having lov'd too long in vaine, Hewd out the portraiture of Venus Sunne In marble rocke upon the which did raine Small drisling drops that from a fount did runne. Imagining the drops would either weare His fury out, or quench his living flame: But when hee saw it bootlesse did appeare, He swore the water did augment the same. So I that seeke in verse to carve thee out, Hoping thy beauty will my flame allay. Veiwing my lines impolish't all throughout, Find my will rather to my love obey: That with the Carver I my work doe blame, Finding it still th'augmenter of my flame. To the Painter. Fond man that hop'st to catch that face, With those false colours, whose short grace Serves but to shew the lookers on, The faults of thy presumption. Or at the least to let us see, That is divine, but yet not shee: Say you could imitate the rayes, Of those eyes that out-shine the dayes, Or counterfeite in red and white, That most vncounterfeited light Of her complexion; yet canst thou, (Great Master though thou be) tell how To paint a vertue? Then desist, This faire, your Artifice hath mist: You should have markt how shee begins, To grow in vertue, not in sinnes: In stead of that same rosie die, You should have drawne out modestie. Whose beauty sits enthroned there, And learne to looke and blush at her. Or can you colour just the same, When vertue blushes or when shame: When sicknes, and when innocence, Shewes pale or white unto the sence? Can such course varnish ere be sed, To imitate her white and red? This may doe well else-where in Spaine, Among those faces died in graine, So you may thrive and what you doe, Prove the best picture of the two. Besides (if all I heare be true,) 'Tis taken ill by some that you Should be so insolently vaine, As to contrive all that rich gaine Into one tablet, which alone May teach us superstition; Instructing our amazed eyes, To admire and worship Imag'ries, Such as quickly might out shine Some new Saint, wer't allow'd a shrine, And turne each wandring looker on, Into a new Pigmaleon. Yet your Art cannot equalize, This Picture in her lovers eyes, His eyes the pencills are which limbe Her truly, as her's coppy him, His heart the Tablet which alone, Is for that porctraite the tru'st stone. If you would a truer see, Marke it in their posteritie: And you shall read it truly there, When the glad world shall see their Heire. Loves Courtship. Kisse lovely Celia and be kind, Let my desires freedome find, Sit thee downe, And we will make the Gods confesse, Mortals enjoy some happines. Mars would disdaine his Mistris charmes, If he beheld thee in my armes, And descend: Thee his mortall Queene to make, Or live as mortall for thy sake. Uenus must loose her title now, And leave to brag of Cupid's bow, Silly Queene. Shee hath but one, but I can spie, Ten thousand Cupids in thy eye. Nor may the sunne behold our blisse, For sure thy eyes doe dazle his If thou feare. That he'll betray thee with his light, Let me ecclipse thee from his sight. And while I shade thee from his eye, Oh let me heare thee gently cry, Celia yeelds, Maids often loose their Maidenhead, Ere they set foote in Nuptiall bed. On a Damaske rose sticking vpon a Ladies breast. Let pride grow big my rose, and let the cleare And damaske colour of thy leaves appeare. Let scent and lookes be sweete and blesse that hand, That did transplant thee to that sacred land. O happy thou that in that garden rest's, That Paradice betweene that Ladies breasts. There's an eternall spring; there shalt thou lie, Betwixt two lilly mounts, and never die. There shalt thou spring amongst the fertile valleyes, By budds like thee that grow in midst of Allyes. There none dare plucke thee, for that place is such That but a good devine, there's none dare touch, If any but approach, straite doth arise A blushing lightning flash, and blasts his eyes. There stead of raine shall living fountaines flow, For wind her fragrant breath for ever blow. Nor now, as earst, one Sun shall on thee shine, But those two glorious suns, her eyes devine. O then what Monarch would not think't a grace, To leave his Regall throne to have thy place. My selfe to gaine thy blessed seat do vow, Would be transformd into a rose as thou. The protestation a Sonnet. No more shall meads be deckt with flowers, Nor sweetnesse dwell in rosie bowers: Nor greenest buds on branches spring, Nor warbling birds delight to sing, Nor Aprill violets paint the grove, If I forsake my Celias love. The fish shall in the Ocean burne, And fountaines sweet shall bitter turne, The humble oake no flood shall know, When floods shall highest hills ore-flow. Blacke LÃ¦the shall oblivion leave, If ere my Celia I deceive. Love shall his bow and shaft lay by, And Venus doves want wings to flie: The Sun refuse to shew his light, And day shall then be turn'd to night, And in that night no starre appeare, If once I leave my Celia deere. Love shall no more inhabite earth, Nor lovers more shall love for worth, Nor joy above in heaven dwell, Nor paine torment poore soules in hell. Grim death no more shall horrid prove, If ere I leave bright Celias love. The tooth-ach cured by a kisse. Fate's now growne mercifull to men, Turning disease to blisse: For had not kind Rheume vext me then, I might not Celia kisse. Phisitians you are now my scorne: For I have found a way: To cure diseases (when forlorne By your dull art) which may Patch vp a body for a time, But can restore to health, No more then Chimists can sublime True Gold, the Indies wealth. That Angell sure that us'd to move The poole, men so admir'd, Hath to her lip the seat of love, As to his heaven retir'd. To his jealous Mistris. Admit (thou darling of mine eyes) I have some Idoll lately fram'd: That under such a false disguise, Our true loves might the lesse be fam'd. Canst thou that knowest my heart suppose, 'Ile fall from thee, and worship those. Remember (deare) how loath and slow, I was to cast a looke or smile, Or one love-line to mis-bestow, Till thou hadst chang'd both face and stile. And art thou growne afraid to see. That maske put on thou mad'st for me. I dare not call those childish feares, Comming from love, much lesse from thee, But wash away with frequent teares, This counterfeit Idolatrie. And henceforth kneele at ne're a shrine, To blind the world, but only thine. The Dart. Oft when I looke I may descry, A little face peepe through that eye, Sure that's the boy which wisely chose, His throne among such beames as those, Which if his quiver chance to fall: May serve for darts to kill withall. The mistake. When on faire Celia I did spie, A wounded heart of stone, The wound had almost made me cry, Sure this heart was my owne. But when I saw it was enthron'd, In her celestiall brest: O then I it no longer own'd,, For mine was ne're so blest. Yet if in highest heavens doe shine, Each constant Martyrs heart: Then shee may well give rest to mine, That for her sake doth smart. Where seated in so high a blisse, Though wounded it shall live: Death enters not in Paradise, The place free life doth give. Or if the place lesse sacred were, Did but her saving eye; Bath my sicke heart in one kind teare, Then should I never dye. Slight balmes may heale a slighter sore, No medicine lesse divine, Can ever hope for to restore, A wounded heart like mine.</field>
