      <field name="fulltext">1 [In many houses] In many houses It is clear That Christ is absent all the year. In many others He abides All dawns, all noons, all eventides. 2 [Fair droops this vaporous evenfall.] Fair droops this vaporous evenfall. The earth-line cuts the sun in two Again, and only half his ball Of melted glory tints the view. The red remainder, it will drop By frozen law beneath the rim And turn afresh the pallid crop Of barley near our common dim. Then will a planet seem to note With joy the fluting of your throat And sparkle compliments for one Known to my heart as breathing sun; And I shall stoop to learn how grey Your eyes become at death of day, Much of the blueness in their shine Being gone, with much of brown from mine. 3 [Agreed. There's more to praise than blame] Agreed. There's more to praise than blame Of what was granted when I came: But how I wish my suit of skin Had not been woven quite so thin! 4 [At Christmas, be the air as wild] At Christmas, be the air as wild As Fury's heart, and dense with snow That swirls along in undefiled Companionship, my Youth will go To Church with Mother. She is dead; Yet so alive that I shall feel Her hand direct me where to tread Between the pews, and where to kneel. 5 [With utter beauty come] With utter beauty come, An inch can be the home Of rapture. Then depart Wide spaces from the heart. At rest upon a frond Of bracken near the pond, This peacock butterfly Eclipses all the sky. 6 [Romeo, black of body] Romeo, black of body, Famous for a bill Coloured like a tuneless Trumpet-daffodil, Modulates his passion Trenchantly, aware How the heart of Juliet Quivers in the pear. Listening to his deepest Alto, and the flight Taken by his fever Mounting to a height Perfectly expressing Love's superlative, Here I learn how little Song is mine to give. 7 [Right over the scalp of his pancakey head] Right over the scalp of his pancakey head He has varnished himself, and the tint is as red As the colour a Cardinal wears in excess Of the homespun of Christ, who was greater with less. How golden the policy bidding him pass His career as a dwarf in a tussock of grass, With no crime to commit! Being Fungus, not Man, He is sinless from birth to the end of his span. 8 [Wiseacres tell me yonder star] Wiseacres tell me yonder star, Beneath the Pole, incredibly afar, Sent off the telegram of light Delivered at twelve o'clock, to-night, Full fifty years before it came in sight. One hundred billion leagues from here It rushes onward, a colossal sphere, To serve the Secret Brain that knows How far a molten traveller goes While cooling for the blackbird and the rose. 9 [It is not idle to pursue] It is not idle to pursue With weighted thought the sweets of you Along the years. Pretended heaven, In spite of wormwood, is a leaven. 10 [I stood in the shadow on forest ground] I stood in the shadow on forest ground Where a squirrel, thinking me bole and roots, Came nearer and nearer, but suddenly found By nose that a mischief was present in boots. A gun went off in his startled head With the bang that is never a bang. How he spat The fury intended to drop me dead And whipped up a beech with the vim of a cat! 11 [Shall we have time for spending] Shall we have time for spending Care and love on the mending Of lives that need befriending? Three hundred and sixty-five days Will offer ten thousand ways. 12 [On seeing you carry the damson, I turned] On seeing you carry the damson, I turned From the fragrance a volume was giving While Herrick, the dewy, sang low in my heart, And flushed a response to the living. How lavish of you, with three minutes to spare Of the day you embroider, to settle And lend this sweetwilliam the fairy-like breath Of a bosom as soft as a petal! 13 ['Tis folly to be sour] 'Tis folly to be sour From hour to hour. Stop moping! Try hoping! 14 [To serve as lantern-bearer, and to toil] To serve as lantern-bearer, and to toil Acceptably, a priest should be alight With flame come down from Heaven. Pretended oil But burns him to a cinder in our sight. 15 [Whence I came I could not see] Whence I came I could not see, For eyelids failed to lift for me; Whither I go is but a guess Alive with throbs of hopefulness. Thus I dwell between unknowns, Gathering lilies, breaking stones. 16 [The loops of sunlit butterflies, the farewell sent] The loops of sunlit butterflies, the farewell sent By doves desiring slumber, leave me discontent. Outstretched in meadow grasses, here once more I try The old ambitionâhow in prayer to glimpse on high That fortress poised as though within a granite sky. Where she for whom I long so vividly is pent, Sighing to hear me sigh. 17 [None knows the land] None knows the land From which you cameâ As Beauty plannedâ Without a name. Christened by dew, Confirmed by heat, Your pride was blue, Your breath was sweet. Ere yet the fire Of Man was lit In any shire, To comfort it, You spent your time In adding worth, As Rose and Lime, To English earth. When Man has gone, To pay his debt, Flowers will live on, Sweet Violet! 18 [Few of us can be so rash] Few of us can be so rash As not to keep a little cash For service on a Rainy Day. Wise it is to put as well Love in storage. Who can tell How often Love will want to pay? 19 [Who trains with clever care a pup] Who trains with clever care a pup To eye, though not to snap, a crust Should recollect that he was given His life âon trust.â 20 [Of all that praised this woman dead] Of all that praised this woman dead, None praised her more than he who said: The love she left behind her Is doubled by remembering hearts And sent to find her. 21 [Though Time moves on] Though Time moves on He leaves behind Yesterday's soul For humankind. 22 [Monotonies that never weary us] Monotonies that never weary us Are consolations. Should a runlet sing Its verse of ripples twenty thousand times Within my notice, glad were I to stay Near marigolds and cresses in the hope That difference might not mingle with the tune. Consider wooddoves also. These contain A brevity of music, yet it dropsâ Resembling thus a wayside balm of oldâ Upon the edges of a mental wound Assuring solaces. For other proof, The kitten purring on the buffet here At night will never vary from her low Monotonous same, and yet will never vex My mind at work on webs of viewless silk, Although she purr till Doomsday. Rivulet, Wooddove, puss, three murmurings of delight, Are voiced so winningly that none can plead To have their soundings other than they are. 23 [Chiff-chaff, fly to England] Chiff-chaff, fly to England And marry there in May! Not to have a compass Is not to lose the way. 24 [This mellowing garden, where at times] This mellowing garden, where at times An Admiral or a Peacock blazesâ To note him is to pulse with rhymesâ On one of many Michaelmas daisies, So glooms the spread of written sky Within my book, now superseded, That Shakespeare's self is told to lie Face downward on the lawn, unheeded. 25 [Since this is Christmas Day] Since this is Christmas Day I must not darken it in any way, Because the King at dead of night Was born to make a cowshed bright. Myrrh, frankincense, and gold I cannot give, as travellers gave of old Beneath his star; yet Thought can dare To kiss Him in his cradle there. 26 [If you climb to the top] If you climb to the top And yet feel sadder, Hurriedly go To the foot of the ladder To search for the poor And make them gladder. 27 [Millions of years before the hour] Millions of years before the hour At which men came to toil and pant Upon this earth, appeared the Flower, The trial Moth, the tentative Ant. Thorned by an Agent never seen, The Rose moved upward, grace by grace, Till, venturing out of undergreen, The Ant stood tickling on her face. Aeons and aeons had woven cloth, Umber or lilac, blue or chrome; Measured, without a slip, the Moth, And dressed him for his moonlit home. Thus superhuman care was spent On lives that winged or leapt or ran Unwitting how their birthdays meant The very odd conclusionâMan! 28 [Day being nearly done] Day being nearly done, England rolls bedward from the sun. I shall not feel another shock Of beauty till tomorrow's clock StrikesâYou! 29 [Liking is not ashamed to fall in debt] Liking is not ashamed to fall in debt, But steady-hearted Love has never yet Endured, as tenant in her snow-white breast, Betrayal of the kiss and oath expressed. Like can slip on and off, as though a glove, Without a single blush. How different is Love! 30 [Because of my embrace] Because of my embrace, The sunburn on your face Is not yet silver-white Beneath the Harvest Moon, Radiant with rounded light. Turn now and let her note My lips upon your throat, That she may find how bare A harvesting she has, With none to kiss her there. 31 [First sweet as plum, then sour as quince] First sweet as plum, then sour as quince That makes the green explorer wince, This woman's bad to manage, since Her flavour well might suit The cleverest judge of fruit And yet (as though to prove him rash And dunderheaded in a flash) Crinkle his palate by a dash Of concentrated juice Too choking for his use. 32 [Christian, since you learn to dare] Christian, since you learn to dare Almost more than soul can bear; Starve in hope; refuse to quake Because of devils; dread to take Tithe from falseness seeming fair; Shoulder a cross as if to share With Christ the thorn, the nail, the spear, Yours is the badge my coat shall wear. 33 [A little past eleven o'clock] A little past eleven o'clock I heard the village voices call God's Son with melody inside The church, at Easter-tide. My soul was torn between the King And one that in a wounding graveâ Far, far from resurrectionâkeeps Her hands so still in Sleep's. 34 [Refuse a longer stay] Refuse a longer stay In bed on this the loveliest day Of all the year, when God is left Alone in Paradise, bereft. First smooth that tangled hair, Then kneel to welcome in a prayer The Little Pilgrim come to make Earth half of Heaven for our sake. 35 [Prodigal birds with a passion for Town] Prodigal birds with a passion for Town, Cocking your eyes at those papery bags; Dead to the records of woodland renown, Why do you waddle on Westminster flags? Ruined, as Romans of old, by the stroke Appetite aimed, you are casual and flabby. Small is your worth, having fled from the oak, Pigeonless pigeons that squat on the Abbey! 36 [I never turn abruptly to the right] I never turn abruptly to the right Or left of any lane without the thought That I shall see at last the heavenly face Of Him for whom my graver years have sought. 37 [Sweet Love would be ashamed to come] Sweet Love would be ashamed to come, As Santa comes, for one night only, She bothers if a single heart For lack of her is bruised and lonely. The Toyman, snug in Bedfordshire For two-and-fifty weeks, lies under His crimson quilt; but Love is loved All round the world as Wakeful Wonder. 38 [Whither he journeys none can ever know.] Whither he journeys none can ever know. Is it Terminus Stop? Is it Junction Go? In comes the train that Love can never meet. The platform's dead; no porter cries Along the frozen silence, âKeep your seat!ââ No guard, âChange here for Paradise!â 39 [We met.] We met. What was it ran Like flashes from a cloud Between us when for each A clamouring heart was speech? 'Twas then, Without a ring, We married where we stood. It was not grief to miss Your handclasp, having this. 40 [This green advertisement of health] This green advertisement of health, Efficiency, and woodland wealth Is but a beetle, yet beware Of treading down his life. Take care! A living lesson, he should serve To teach his betters not to swerve From natural law, as Man is wont To do in folly. Beetles don't. 41 [Perdita stooped above a rose] Perdita stooped above a rose To mingle breath, as if a pair Of lovers, famished at the close Of dreary day, were whispering there. Fortunate flower, to touch the swell Of throat that Iâso long, so longâ Have wearied sullen words to tell At middle night to stars in song! 42 [Bells at half-past kissing-time] Bells at half-past kissing-time Echo from the mountain; Yet must Mary thrice re-fill Her bucket from the fountain. Little help in lettering bark, Kicking stones, and drumming Feet on turf when Love's so late That Love may not be coming! Absence is a fiery sauce, Flavour grows by missing. Fast on Thursday, to increase The tang of Friday's kissing. 43 [Keenly alert, his brain and soul admired] Keenly alert, his brain and soul admired The intricate webbing of our Master's plan, Yet dared to wonder how this globe required So many tart and turbulent sorts of Man. 44 [Contrition is a bloom] Contrition is a bloom Of everlasting mien. Run to my desolate room At this eleventh hour To offer me afresh The young familiar flower That, regularly worn, Had kept my heart serene Till time begot a thorn. 45 [Who runs from sin, deploring with the tremulous mind] Who runs from sin, deploring with the tremulous mind Perverseness when his soul was stricken deaf and blind, And knocks at Heaven for grace, will surely be allowed To watch the sevenfold birth of colour on his cloud. 46 [Dead to the pen, alive to print] Dead to the pen, alive to print, Two Authors soothe my illness. That book of prose is spiritual lint For binding me to stillness; This flowery verse recalls the glint Of marigolds by neighbouring willows, And seems to flood with buttercups My bedspread and my pillows. 47 [They give a rich and ordered home] They give a rich and ordered home, With furnishings of gold, To other housewives, thinking naught Of poverty and cold. Yet none of them is prodigal, None lunatic; for these So ruthless murderers of self Are patriot honey-bees. 48 [How much for you] How much for you, His Little One, God's earnest love To-day has done! Who cared so well Throughout the light Will be as warm A friend at night. 49 [Your sweet life went] Your sweet life went, As though a petal fallen from a rose, Turning my Easter into Lent. None other shared The final leap of blueness in the eyes Telling a heart how much they cared. 50 [For being allowed the radiant right to come] For being allowed the radiant right to come From none knows where to Earth and use it as my home, Marvel and praise. The cost? Who cares to count it twice, If but a second pause in darkness be the price? 51 [Come brooming, Children! We shall go] Come brooming, Children! We shall go Across our common to the show Of gold that soon, from tangled sod, Will fashion purses, pod by pod, Obeying God. Broom dressed in glory! While we move Toward our favourite, let us prove Ourselves affectionate to weeds, Their stature, leafage, flowering, seeds, In lanes and meads. Dead Nettles can in grace compare With any bloom, however fair. Enchanted, count by twos and threes The snow-white imitation bees That cling to these. How well they note in turfy schools The everlasting set of rules Drawn up for them, and, doing thus, Without the fault of human fuss, Admonish us! 52 [Wonder no more that I should breathe an hour] Wonder no more that I should breathe an hour Of musing thus beside a forest flower. Surely no loss of time is here. To haste Beyond her dewy testament were waste. 53 [Some love the skies] Some love the skies The most when darkened eyes Look inward and peruse Imagined hues. 54 [While here I sit to love the power] While here I sit to love the power Of peace within a tremulous flower, An Evil roars along the blue, Learning to mingle blood and dew. 55 [Fear not. The most emphatic sign] Fear not.
