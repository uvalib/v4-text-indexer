      <field name="fulltext">CONTENTS OF THE FIRST COLLECTION. Taylor on Thame Isis: OR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TWO FAMOUS Riuers of Thame and Jsis, who being conioyned or combined together, are called Thamisis, or Thames. With all the Flats, Shoares, Shelues, Sands, Weares, Stops, Riuers, Brooks, Bournes, Streames, Rills, Riuolets, Streamelets, Creeks, and whatsoeuer helps the said Riuers haue, from their springs or heads, to their falls into the Ocean. As also a discouery of the hinderances which doe impeach the passage of Boats and Barges, betwixt the famous Vniuersity of Oxford, and the City of London. TO The Right Honourable Lords, Thomas Earle of Arundell and Surrey, Earle Marshall of England: Edward Lord Viscount Wimbleton: Henry Lord Viscount Fawlkland: and Sir Thomas Edmonds, Knight, Treasurer of the Kings Houshold: Lords of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuy Councell, and Commissioners for the Nauigation and fishing of the famous Riuers of Thames and Medway. Right Noble Lords, with sorrow I beheld, That which to write my duty hath compel'd, And (from my pen) the Thames flow'd to the presse, From thence it ebbes to you to finde redresse. My Honourable Lord of Dorchester, He truly noted in particular, Dame Isis wrongs, and Thames great injuries, For they were sad perspectiues to his eyes, And had his Lordship liu'd his meaning was To make the Riuer passable, to passe. For then with noble care and diligence He view'd the helps, and the impediments, Which aid, or hinder passage vp and downe, Twixt Oxford City, and braue Windsor towne; Yet as I sometimes row'd and sometimes steer'd, I view'd where well, where ill the way appeard; And here I haue describ'd the way we went, Commixing truth with honest merriment, My threed-bare wit a mad wooll gathering goes, To shew the things in verse I saw in prose; And (Honourable Peeres) I humbly craue, My artlesse lines may your acceptance haue, Wishing each fault remou'd (which stands vnfit) As soone as you can reade what I haue writ, Desiring God to giue you high content Here, and hereafter glory permanent. Humbly deuoted with his best endeuours, to all your Honourable personages, Iohn Taylor. TO The memory of the truly Noble deceased, Dvdley Carleton, Lord Viscount Dorchester, principall Secretary of State to his Maiestie of Great Britaine. If He be blest that is of Noble bloud, And being made great, is both great and good, Who is a Christian euery way compleat, Who holds it better to be good than great, Whose life was guided with good Conscience, Whose end was sauing faith and penitence, These blessings Noble Dorchester were thine, And these haue made thee 'Immortall and diuine. To any Body. I that ne're tasted the Castalian fount, Or came in ken of the Thessalian Mount; I that could ne're attaine to wet my lips, With Tempes liquour, or sweet Aganipps, Who neuer yet haue so much fauour won, To purchase one carrowse from Helicon, Who with good Poets dare compare no way But one, which is in being poore as they; And hauing neuer seene the Muses hill, Am plentifully stor'd with want of skill, Then Fount, or Mount, nor sacred treble trine, Are no assistants in this worke of mine: But ancient Isis current chrystall spring Inspires my braine, and I her praises sing, And Tame with Isis joynes his pearely streames, Whose combination are my ample theames; Though (for the most part) in the tracts I tread, Of learned Camden, Speed, and Hollinshead, And Draytons painfull Polyolbyon, Whose fame shall liue, despight obliuion, These are the guides I follow, with pretence T'abbreuiate and extract their Quint-essence; Nor can it be to them disparagement, That I come after in the wayes they went, For they of former writers followers be, I follow them, and some may follow me; And man to man a President is made In Art or Science, mysterie or Trade, As they before these Riuers bounds did show, Here I come after with my Pen and row. TAYLOR ON THAME ISIS. Ovr patron Phœbus, whose sweet influence, Doth quicken all our reason, life and sense, Tis he makes grasse to grow, &amp; Riuers spring, He makes both my songs, subiect, and me sing; His beames the waters doe extenuate To vapours, and those vapours eleuate Into the middle Region, where they tumble, And melt, and then descend and are made humble, Moystning the face of many a spacious hill, Where soaking deepe the hollow vaults they fill, Where into Riuers they againe breake out, So nature in a circle runnes about. Large Downes doe treasure vp great store of raine, Whose bowels vent it in the vales againe: No place in England could a treasure keepe, Thames to maintaine, but Coteswould (queene of sheepe.) In Glostershire (my dearest mother earth) From whose faire City I deriue my birth, Are Coteswould hills, and in the farthest cliffe Of all those hils of Isis head is chiefe: Schollers from Gloster that to Oxford ride The truth of my assertion oft haue tride; On their right hand neare Cubberley they passe, Two Wells as sweet as milke, as cleare as glasse, Whence Isis first doth pedegree deriue, Those two are able there two mills to driue. Corruptly called Stow the old. At Burton on the water, south from Stow Vpon the Would, great vaines of waters flow To Burford, and to Witney, and along Till they make meadowes large, and Isis strong. The famous Riuer Isis hath her spring Neare Tetbury, and downe along doth bring (As hand-maids) to attend her progresse, Churne, Colne, Windrush, Yenload, Leech, whose windings turne, And Meads, and Pastures trims, bedecks, and dresses, Like an vnvaluable chaine of ESSES. After releefe of many a Ducke and Goose, At Saint Iohns bridge they make their rendeuous, And there like robbers crossing London way, Bid many a bare-foot Welshman wade or stay. Close vnder Oxford one of Englands eyes, Chiefe of the chiefest Vniuersities, From Banbury desirous to adde knowledge To zeale, and to be taught in Magdalen College, The Riuer Charwell doth to Isis runne, And beares her company to Abington, Whil'st very neare that towne on Barkshire side, The Riuer Ock doth into Isis glide; These fountaines and fish-breeding Riuolets, (The Countries nurses, nourishers, and teats,) Attend Dame Isis downe to Dorchester, Neare which her louely Tame doth meet with her, There Tame his Isis doth embrace and kisse, Both joyn'd in one, cal'd Tame or Tame Isis, Isis like Salmacis becomes with Tame Hermaphrodite in nature and in name. Tame doth deriue his Spring or Pedegree Neare Mesworth in the vale of Aylsbury, From whence he many miles with strange meanders, To finde his lovely Isis slowly wanders, Through fertile lands a quiet course he keepes, Till Southward vnder Whately bridge he creepes, And (like a Pilgrim) trauels all alone, No Brooke or Riuer waiting him vpon, Onely three namelesse Riuolets and two springs, Which very priuately their tribute brings, Bewailing Isis absence, and his fate, Poore Tame all heauie and disconsolate, Vnnauigable, scorn'd, despis'd, disgrac'd, Hauing in vaine so many paces pac'd; Despairing and quite desperate with these harmes, He hurles himselfe vnwares in Isis armes; Nor closer can the barke be to the tree, Than their infoldings and embracings be; They rise and fall together, and they are In want and plenty to haue equall share; And Tame with Isis will be both one riuer, Till in the Ocean they their names deliuer. At Wallingford and Pangbourne, two small rils, Their homages to Thamisis instils. The more the riuer runnes, the more tis spreading, Till in it's course it falls as low as Reading, Where Kennet kindly comes with force and source, To aid and helpe Thamisis in their course. The head of Kennet is neare Ramsbury, Passing to Hungerford by Newbury. The riuer Anborne out of Hampshire flies, To Kennet with some namelesse small supplies Of pettie rills, which passing here and there, Who to repeat, teadious and needlesse were. To Sunning and by Bisham Thames descends To Marlow (called great) from whence it wends; Whereas a little rill from Wickham towne, To wait vpon the Thames comes gliding downe; Then pleasantly the riuer takes free way To Topley hills, by Maidenhead and Bray, Till it to Windsor and to Stanes doth win, And there the riuer Colne comes gliding in: Colne hath its head or spring in Hartfordshire, At Abbots Langley, or else very neere, With some small petty rils and riuolets, By Colbrooke vnto Stanes and Thames it gets, The riuer Wey, with diuers namelesse springs Neare Chertsey, vnto Thames their seruice brings. Wey (beyond Guilford) help'd with creeks and crooks, At last at Oatlands towards Sunbury lookes, And there a little rill, (scarce worth a line) In Middlesex doth with the Thames combine. Neare Reygate towne the riuer Mole is found, Bearing its course, runs (Mole-like) vnder ground; But rising vp by Notbury againe, At Molsey it the Thames doth entertaine. From Ewell towne the riuer Brent makes haste, Who by the Thames is louingly embrac'd: Next which is Chiswicke towne, and Hammersmith, It entertaines a rill, or little frith, And after that below, neare Wandsworth mill, Comes in another brooke or namelesse rill; Thus I the riuer bring, and it brings me From their first springs to London bridge you see. Now from the bridge below descend I must, Till Thames it selfe doth in the Ocean thrust, And if my paines to good men proue a pleasure, My gaine's beyond my merit, beyond measure, Of Watermen, men scarce can finde a Slower, Yet hey, to Grauesend hoe and somewhat lower. Braue London Bridge claimes right preheminence For strength, and Architects magnificence, To be true None-such, for no eye beheld A bridge which it each way hath paralleld. The arches (Tame and Isis) shadie bowres, Through which both East and West in twice twelue houres Twice Neptune greets it flowing from the Maine, And twice the riuer sends it backe againe, And as the flouds or ebbes encrease or falls, They through the arches murmure Madrigals, Whil'st th'Eddies divers wayes doth turne and trace, Tame doth with Isis dance the wilde goose chace, From this rare matchlesse piece of workmanship, I with the tide of Ebbe must quickly slip, And downe into the Riuer Lea I hie, That parts Midsaxon from East Saxony. Which riuer fals from Ware to Walthamstow, And downe by Layton vnto Stratford Bow, Some call it Lea, but Camden calls it Stowre, And neare Blackwall it in the Thames doth powre, Next Rodeing is (a Brooke or riuer small) Which Foord from Berking into Thames doth fall. From Hauering, Burntwood and from Ockingdon, Three little Rils into the Thames do run, Th'are namelesse, or scarce worth the nomination. And so on Essex side I end my station. And now I'le crosse into the County Kent To note what riuers from her bound are sent, To wait vpon the mighty bigswolne Thames, Who now is grown the Prince of Brittains streams. By Bromley glides the riuer Rauensburne To Deptford downe with many a wandring turne, The riuer Darrent is the next and last, Which downe by Dartford into Thames is cast. And thus from Glocester shire neare Tetbury And Buckingham shire close by Aylsbury, I haue brought Isis and her partner Tame With twenty seven helpes losing each their name, Who spend themselues to make the Thames grow great, Till (below Lee) it lose both name and seat, Through many Countries as these waters passe, They make the Pastures fructifie in grasse: Cattell grow fat, and cheese and butter Cheape, Hey in abundance, Corne by stricke and heape, Beasts breed, and Fish increase, fowles multiply, It brings wood, Cole, and Timber plenteously: It beares the lame and weake, makes fat the leane, And keepes whole townes and countries sweet and cleane; Wer't not for Thames (as heauens high hand doth blesse it) We neither could haue fish, or fire to dresse it, The very Brewers would be at a fault, And buy their water dearer than their mault, And had they malt and water at desire, What shift (a Gods name) would they make for fire? There's many a Seaman, many a Nauigator, Watermen, fishers, bargemen on this water, Themselues and families beyond compare, In number more than hundred thousands are, Who doe their Prince and Country often serue, And wer't not for this riuer might goe sterue; And for the good to England it hath done, Shall it to spoyle and ruine be let runne? Shall priuate persons for their gainfull use, Ingrosse the water and the land abuse, Shall that which God and nature giues us free, For vse and profit in community, Be barr'd from men, and damb'd vp as in Thames, (A shamelesse auarice surpassing shames;) I speake not of the riuers bounds below, Whereas the tides perpetuall ebbe and flow, Nor is the riuer wanting much repaire, Within the bounds of Londons honour'd Maior, Which limits all are cleare from stakes and piles, Beyond Stanes bridge (thats more than forty miles) But I (from Oxford) downe to Stanes will slide, And tell the riuers wrongs which I espide, Not doubting but good mindes their powers will lend, T'endeuour these abuses to amend: Therefore I pray the Readers to dispence, And pardon my abrupt intelligence. From Oxford two miles Ifley distant is, And there a new turne pike doth stand amisse, Another stands at Stanford, below that, Weeds, shelues, and shoales all waterlesse and flat; At Newnham locke there's plac'd a fishing weare, A grauell hill too high, scarce water there; At Abington the shoales are worse and worse, That Swift ditch seemes to be the better course, Below which towne neare Sutton there are left Piles that almost our Barges bottome cleft; Then Sutton locks are great impediments, The waters fall with such great violence, Thence downe to Cullom, streame runs quicke and quicker, Yet we rub'd twice a ground for want of liquor. The Weare of Carpenter's sans fault I thinke, But yet neare Witnum towne a tree did sinke, Whereas by fortune we our Barge did hit, And by misfortune there a board was split; At Clifton there are rocks, and sands, and flats, Which made vs wade, and wet like drowned rats, The passage bare, the water often gone, And rocks smooth worne, doe paue it like free stone. From Clifton downe to Wallingford we fleet, Where (for annoyance) piles are plac'd vnmeet; From thence our Oares did downe the riuer draw, Vntill we came vnto a mungrill Spaw, A Bath, a Spring, a Fountaine, or a Rill, That issues from the bowels of a hill, A hill it may be tearm'd, or demie mountaine, From out whose entralls springs this new-found fountaine, Whose water (cleare as Chrystall, sweet as hony,) Cures all diseases (except want of mony,) It helpes the Palsey, Cramp, or Apoplexie, Scab, scurfe, or scald, or dropsie if it vex yee, The Plurisie, the Lethargie, Strangury, It cures the Cataracke, and the Stone assure yee; The head-ach, Megrim, Canker, or the Mumps, Mange, Murrians, Meazles, Melancholy dumps, It is of vertue, vigor, and of force To driue all malladies from man or horse; Help'd of a Tertian ague I saw one, (Weake, and not worth the ground he went vpon) Who drank the water mingled with the clay, And presently the Ague ran away; It cures an old sore, or a bruised blow, It made the deafe to heare, the lame to goe; One dumbe came thither, and straightway disputed, And on the trees are crutches executed; To heale greene wounds it hath such Soueraigne power, It cur'd a broken pate in halfe an houre, Which sconce was crack'd on purpose to th'intent, To try the vertue of the Element. If any man imagine I doe lie, Let him goe thither, breake his pate and trie. Some say crack'd maidenheads are there new sodered, I'm sure the hill with beggers is embroidered, And all those beggers are with little cost, With lice and scabs embroidered and embost; And as it were the Well of Aristotle, The water is farre fetch'd in many a bottle, The clay mixt with the liquour kils the Cornes, Ah could it cure some Cuckolds of their hornes, It would haue patients out of euery climat, More than my patience could endure to rime at, And had it but the vertue to surcease Some clamorous tongues, and make them hold their peace, Thousands of husbands would their wiues send thither; That they might be recouered all together. Apothecaries I lament your lots, Your medcines now will mould in Gallipots, Your drugges with barbarous names vnbought will lie, And waste and languish in obscurity, Twill begger all the Quacksaluers outright, And all our Mountebanks are vndone quite, But whats become of me? can any tell? Good Reader helpe me out of this strange well; I with my pen its praise did meane to touch, And it (I feare) hath made me write too much, Which if I haue, let your constructions be, Blame the strange working waters and not me: But he that sayes that I doe ouer-doe, Let him goe thither and hee'le doe so to; So farewell, Well, well fare thou, still excell, Increase in operation, Well farewell. Beneath the fountaine, next is Cleaue locks fall, And neare to that a locke men Goring call, But hauing past the locke at Gorings there, At Master Coltons house we had good cheare, With hearty welcome, but 'twas for his sake That did this hopefull businesse vndertake, Yet with our hearty thanks we thanke them all, That din'd vs like a solemne festiuall. From thence to Harts locke downward we descended, And next to Whitchurch locke which must be mended, Because the waters turne so swift and various, And gainst our wils to dangerous courses carry vs: Next there's a Weare, that if it had its right, Should be well lib'd, or else remoued quite; Below that Maple Ducham locke appeares, Where stands three faulty and vntoward Weares; Then neare the bridge of Cauersham there is One Welbecks Weare, fit to be mou'd I wis; As past the locke at Cauersham we row, We found the riuer very foule below, With weeds and hills of mud and grauell choak'd, That with our Oares and staues we thrust and poak'd. Next Breaches Weare near Sunning naught doth lie, And Sunning locke the groundsill is too high, Besides two Gin-holes that are very bad And Sunning bridge much need of mending had; Haules Weare doth almost crosse the riuer all, Making the passage straight and very small, How can that man be counted a good liuer That for his priuate vse will stop a riuer? Shiplocke, or Cottrels locke stand very neare, Not from that farre is Elmes his fishing weare, Whereas the riuers case is altered well, For Master Ployden neare that place doth dwell; Marsh locke is plac'd a little aboue Henly, And there the Thames is kept indifferent cleanly, And here at Henley once in fifteene yeares, A Riuer stranger in the street appeares, Whose cesterne in the Woods his wealth doth gather, In that long space, and cannot get it rather, But gotten out of high-way-flouds, and leaues, As Dutchmen keepe the drops of their house-eues. The cesterne fils and then the wals breake downe, And send their stowage vnto Henley towne, Another fifteene yeares the wals repaire, And fill the place with raine or thawed ayre, And being so replenisht in that space, It runnes (rub rub) close by the bowling place. Neare Henley (some three quarters of a mile) A little Ile digresse and change my stile. Should I forget the good Iudge Whitlocks loue, Vnmanner'd and vngratefull I should proue, It was about the time (as I remember) In August, some fiue dayes before September) We landed neare the noble Iudges harbour, (With stomacks sharpe as razour of a Barber) The time was short, we neither toyd nor trifled, The Kitchin, Pantry, Pastry strait we rifled; The Celler and the Buttery both we forrag'd, By which braue booty we were much encourag'd, Sacke and good Claret drawne from Tierce and Punchion, That seru'd one whole day, and two euenings Nunchion; Our bread as good as euer baker sifted, Our wine (rare wine) as ere to mouth was lifted, And in our businesse (though we all were hasty) We did surprize an excellent Venson pasty, We there did saue the labour of inuiters; Whole ioynts of mutton prou'd vs good sheepe-biters, Our beere was brauely boyl'd and strongly malted, Our Pidgeon Pie was pepper'd well and salted, Most tender Chickins, Pullet, and a Capon, We (in our fury) did commit a rape on; A mighty scarlet Lobster last we seased, And so with these Acchats our minds were eased, But that which made our viands taste the better, Was welcome, which made each of vs a debter; And long may he and his suruiue and flourish, That did poore trauellers so kindly nourish, These lines are writ in duty to expresse Our loue, our duty, and our thankfulnesse. From thence we hi'd vs with the streame and wind, And in the Barge at noone we brauely din'd, And as our meat our gratefull minds did moue, We dranke Iudge Whitlocks health to shew our loue. Then came we to a locke call'd Hambleton, Whereas the streame a handsome course doth runne; Next Mednam Weare doth speedy mending lacke, It puts the Thames, and Thames puts it to wracke, And neare Frogge-mill two paltry stops there are, That in the Riuer take too great a share; Newlocke at Harley, and a Weare below, Almost a stop, (fit to be clear'd I know;) Then Temple locke, 'boue Bisham Church there is, Beneath which is a Weare somewhat amisse, Then Marlow locke is worst I must confesse, The water is so pinch'd with shallownesse, Beneath which is a Weare should be defac'd, And Cottrels Weare of Cookham be displac'd. A Weare doth to one Holdernesse belong, Which doth the riuer most iniurious wrong, Neare which a Spring runs from the chalkie hills, The which (not long agoe) did driue two mills, A stop 'gainst Toplow Warren much doth spread Next Bolters lock, (a mile from Maydenhead.) Thus haue I past the locks, now weares and stops, From thence as farre as Stanes mine Inkhorne drops. 'Boue Maidenhead bridge a stop and one beneath, Which both to be amended I bequeath; Against Bray church, and Bray mill, stand three more, Indifferent bad as any were before; A stop at Water Oakley naught doth lie, At Rudles poole the grauell hills too high, The water turnes so short, and runnes so quicke, That oft the Barges there a ground doe stricke; Neare Boueney Church a dangerous stop is found, On which fiue passengers were lately drown'd; Below the bridge at Windsor (passing thus) Some needlesse piles stand very perillous: Neare Eaton College is a stop and weare, Whose absence well the riuer may forbeare; A stop, a weare, a dangerous sunke tree, Not farre from Datchet Ferry are all three; A grauell bed, two stops and stakes beside, Against and neare old Windsor Church we spide, With two stops more we saw neare Ankerwike, And neare my Lord Maiors stone we saw the like, Besides an Aight or Island there we found, Hedg'd farre into the streame to gaine more ground; From Stanes we past to Lallum guls, most shallow, Whereas fiue Barges fast aground did wallow; And such a trowling current there did set, That we were vildly puzzled by to get; Tumbling 'twixt Middlesex and Surrey land, We came where Chertseyes crooked bridge doth stand, Which sure was made all by left-handed men, The like of it was neuer in my ken; Wiw waw to Oakam ward, kim kam, kiwwaw, That through it men can hardly set or row, That's the last fault I found that merits note, And downe from thence we merrily did flote. Thus haue I shew'd Thames wrongs in generall, And wish they may be mou'd, or mended all; And who can but with pity here behold These multitudes of mischiefes manifold? Shall Thames be barr'd its course with stops and locks, With Mils, and hils, with gravell beds, and rocks: With weares, and weeds, and forced Ilands made, To spoile a publike for a priuate Trade? Shame fall the doers, and Almighties blessing Be heap'd vpon their heads that seeke redressing. Were such a businesse to be done in Flanders Or Holland mongst the industrious Netherlanders; They to deepe passages would turne our hils, To Windmils they would change our watermils. All helpes vnto this riuer they would ayd, And all impediments should be destroyed; Our vagabonds (the wandering brood of Caine,) They would enforce those runnagates take paine, Whereby much profit quickly would accrue, (For labour robs the hangman of his due.) In common reason, all men must agree That if the riuer were made cleane and free, One Barge, with eight poore mens industrious paines, Would carry more than forty carts or waines. And euery waine to draw them horses fiue, And each two men or boyes to guide or driue, Charge of an hundred horse and 80. men With eight mens labour would be serued then, Thus men would be employed, and horse preseru'd, And all the Countrey at cheape rates be seru'd. T'is said the Dutchmen taught vs drinke and swill, I'm sure we goe beyond them in that skill, I wish (as we exceed them in what's bad,) That we some portion of their goodnesse had: Then should this worthy worke be soone begun, And with successefull expedition done: Which I despaire not of, but humbly plead, That God his blessings will increase and spread On them that loue this work, and on their heires, Their goods and chattels, and on all that's theirs: I wish them blest externall, and internall, And in the end with happinesse eternall. FINIS The Old, Old, Very Old Man: OR, The Age and long Life of Thomas Par, the Son of John Parr of Winnington in the Parish of Alberbury; in the County of Salopp, (or Shropshire) who was Borne in the Raigne of King Edward the 4??. being aged 152. yeares and odd Monethes. His Manner of Life and Conversation in so long a Pilgrimage; his Marriages, and his bringing up to London about the end of September last. 1635. Whereunto is Added a Postscript, shewing the many remarkable Accidents that hapned in the Life of this Old Man. The Epistle. Hee may be great in spir't, though small in sight, Whilst all his best of service, is Delight. The Old'st, your Subject is; but for my use, I make him here, the Subject of my Muse: And as his Aged Person gain'd the grace, That where his Soveraign was, to be in place, And kisse your Royall Hand; J humbly crave, His Lives Discription may Acceptance have. And as your Majesty hath oft before Look'd on my Poems; Pray reade this one more. Your Majesties most Humble Subject and Servant, Iohn Taylor. An Old man's twice a child (the proverb saies) And many old men nere saw halfe his daies Of whom I write; for hee at first had life, When Yorke and Lancasters Domestique strife In her owne blood had factious England drench'd, Vntill sweet Peace those civil flames had quench'd. When as fourth Edwards raigne to end drew nigh, Iohn Parr (a man that liv'd by Husbandry) Begot this Thomas Parr, and borne was Hee The yeare of fourteen hundred eighty three. And as his Fathers Living and his Trade, Was Plough, and Cart, Sithe, Sickle, Bill, and Spade; The Harrow, Mattock, Flayle, Rake, Fork, &amp; Goad, And Whip, and how to Load, and to Vnload; Old Tom hath shew'd himselfe the Son of Iohn, And from his Fathers function hath not gone. Yet I have read of as meane Pedigrees, That have attain'd to Noble dignities: Agathocles, a Potters Son, and yet The Kingdome of Sicilia hee did get. Great Tamberlaine, a Scythian Shepherd was, Yet (in his time) all Princes did surpasse. First Ptolomey (the King of Ægypts Land) A poore mans Son of Alexanders Band. Dioclesian, Emperour, was a Scriveners Son, And Proba from a Gard'ner th'Empire won. Pertinax was a Bondmans Son, and wan The Empire; So did Valentinian, Who was the off-spring of a Rope-maker, And Maximinus of a Mule-driver. And if I on the truth doe rightly glance, Hugh Capet was a Butcher, King of France. By this I have digrest, I have exprest Promotion comes not from the East or West. So much for that, now to my Theame againe: This Thomas Parr hath liv'd th'expired Raigne Of ten great Kings and Queenes, th'eleventh now sways The Scepter, (blest by th'ancient of all days) Hee hath surviv'd the Edwards, fourth and fift; And the third Richard, who made many a shift To place the Crowne on his Ambitious head; The seventh &amp; eighth brave Henries both are dead, Sixt Edward, Mary, Phillip, Elsabeth, And blest remembred Iames, all these by death Have changed life, and almost 'leven yeares since The happy raigne of Charles our gracious Prince, Tom Parr hath liv'd, as by Record appeares Nine Monthes, one hundred fifty, and two yeares. Amongst the Learn'd, 'tis held in generall That every seventh yeare's Climactericall, And dang'rous to mans life, and that they be Most perillous at th'Age of sixty three, Which is, nine Climactericals; but this Man Of whom I write, (since first his life began) Hath liv'd of Climactericals such plenty, That he hath almost out-liv'd two and twenty. For by Records, and true Certificate, From Shropshiere late, Relations doth relate, That Hee liv'd 17 yeares with Iohn his Father, And 18 with a Master, which I gather To be full thirty five; his Sires decease Left him foure yeares Possion of a Lease; Which past, Lewis Porter Gentleman, did then For twenty one yeares grant his Lease agen: That Lease expir'd, ehe Son of Lew's cald Iohn, Let him the like Lease, and that time being gone, Then Hugh, the Son of Iohn (last nam'd before) For one and twenty yeares sold one Lease more. And lastly, he hath held from Iohn, Hugh's Son, A Lease for's life these fifty yeares, out-run: And till old Thomas Parr, to Earth againe Returne, the last Lease must his owne remaine. Thus having shew'd th'extention of his Age, I'le shew some Actions of his Pilgrimage. A tedious time a Batchelour hee tarried, Full eightie yeares of age before he married: His Continence, to question I'le not call, Mans frailtie's weake, and oft doth slip and fall. No doubt but hee in fourscore yeares might find In Salop's Countie, females faire and kind: But what have I to doe with that; let passe, At th'age aforesaid hee first married was To Iane, Iohn Taylors Daughter; and 'tis said, That she (before he had her) was a Mayd. With her he liv'd yeares three times ten and two, And then she dy'd, (as all good wives will doe.) She dead, he ten yeares did a Widdower stay; Then once more ventred in the Wedlock way: And in affection to his first wife Iane, Hee tooke another of that name againe; (With whom he now doth live) she was a widow To one nam'd Anthony (and surnam'd Adda) She was (as by report it doth appeare) Of Gillsels Parish, in Mountgom'ry-shiere, The Daughter of Iohn Lloyde (corruptly Flood) Of ancient house, and gentle Cambrian Blood. But hold, I had forgot, in's first wives Time, Hee frayly, fouly, fell into a Crime, Which richer, poorer, older men, and younger, More base, more noble, weaker men, and stronger Have falne into. The Cytherean, or the Paphæan game, That thundring Iupiter did oft inflame; Most cruell cut-throat Mars layd by his Armes, And was a slave to Loves Inchanting charmes, And many a Pagan god, and semi-god, The common road of lustfull love hath trod: For from the Emp'rour to the russet Clowne, All states, each sex, from Cottage to the Crowne, Have in all Ages since the first Creation, Bin foyld, &amp; overthrown with Loves temptation: So was old Thomas, for he chanc'd to spy A Beauty, and Love entred at his eye, Whose pow'rfull motion drew on sweet consent, Consent drew Action, Action drew Content, But when the period of those joyes were past, Those sweet delights were sourely sauc'd at last. The flesh retaines, what in the Bone is bred, And one Colts tooth was then in old Toms head, It may be he was guld as some have bin, And suffred punishment for others sinne; For pleasures like a Trap, a grin, or snare, Or (like a painted harlot) seemes most faire; But when she goes away, and takes her leave, No ugly Beast so foul a shape can have. Faire Katherin Milton, was this Beauty bright, (Faire like an Angell, but in weight too light) Whose fervent feature did inflame so far The Ardent fervour of old Thomas Parr, That for Lawes satisfaction, 'twas thought meet, He should be purg'd, by standing in a Sheet, Which aged (He) one hundred and five yeare, In Alberbury's Parish Church did weare. Should All that so offend, such Pennance doe, Oh, what a price would Linnen rise unto, All would be turn'd to sheets, our shirts &amp; smocks Our Table linnen, very Porters Frocks Would hardly scape trans-forming, but all's one, He suffred, and his Punishment is done. But to proceed, more serious in Relation, He is a Wonder, worthy Admiration, Hee's (in these times fill'd with Iniquity) No Antiquary, but Antiquity; For his Longeuity's of such extent, That hee's a living mortall Monument. And as high Towres, (that seeme the sky to shoulder) By eating Time, consume away, and molder, Vntill at last in piece meale they doe fall; Till they are buried in their Ruines All: So this Old Man, his limbs their strength have left, His teeth all gone, (but one) his sight bereft, His sinewes shrunk, his blood most chill and cold, Small solace, Imperfections manifold: Yet still his sp'rits possesse his mortall Trunk; Nor are his senses in his ruines shrunk, But that his Hearing's quicke, his stomacke good, Hee'l feed well, sleep well, well disgest his food. Hee will speake heartily, laugh, and be merry; Drinke Ale, and now and then a cup of Sherry; Loves Company, and Vnderstanding talke, And (on both sides held up) will sometimes walk. And though old Age his face with wrinckles fill, He hath been handsome, and is comely still, Well fac'd; and though his Beard not oft corrected, Yet neate it growes, not like a Beard neglected; From head to heele, his body hath all over, A Quick-set, Thick-set nat'rall hairy cover. And thus (as my dull weake Invention can) I have Annatomiz'd this poore Old Man. Though Age be incident to most transgressing, Yet Time well spent, makes Age to be a blessing. And if our studies would but daign to look, And seriously to ponder Natures Booke, We there may read, that Man, the noblest Creature, By ryot and excesse doth murder Nature. This man nere fed on deare compounded dishes, Of Metamorphos'd beasts, fruits, fowls, and fishes, The earth, and ayre, the boundlesse Ocean Were never rak'd nor forrag'd for this Man; Nor ever did Physician to (his cost) Send purging Physick through his guts in post: In all his life time he was never knowne, That drinking others healths, he lost his owne; The Dutch, the French, the Greek, and Spanish Grape, Vpon his reason never made a Rape; For Ryot, is for Troy an Annagram; And Ryot wasted Troy, with sword and flame: And surely that which will a Kingdome spill, Hath much more power one silly man to kill, Whilst sensuality the Pallat pleases, The body's fill'd with surfets, and diseases; By Ryot (more than War) men slaughtred be, From which confusion this Old Man is free. He once was catch'd in the Venerall Sin, And (being punish'd) did experience win, That carefull feare his Conscience so did strike, He never would againe attempt the like. Which to our understandings may expresse Mens dayes are shortned through lasciviousnesse, And that a competent contenting Dyet Makes men live long, and soundly sleepe in quiet. Mistake me not, I speake not to debar Good fare of all sorts; for all Creatures are Made for mans use, and may by Man be us'd, Not by voratious Gluttony abus'd. For hee that dares to scandall or deprave Good hous-keeping; Oh hang up such a Knave, Rather commend (what is not to be found) Then injure that w?? makes the world renownd. Bounty hath got a spice of Lethargie, And liberall noble Hospitallity Lyes in consumption, almost pin'd to death, And Charity benum'd, neere out of Breath. May Englands few good hous-keepers be blest With endlesse Glory, and eternall Rest; And may their Goods, Lands, and their happy Seed With heav'ns best Blessings multiply and breed. 'Tis madnesse to build heigh with stone and lime, Great houses, that may seeme the Clouds to clime, With spacious Halls, large Galleries, brave roomes Fit to receive a King, Peeres, Squires and Groomes; Amongst which rooms, the devill hath put a Witch in, And made a small Tobacco-box the Kitchin; For Covetousnesse the Mint of Mischiefe is, And Christian Bounty the High-way to Blisse. To weare a Farm in shoo-strings edg'd with gold, And spangled Garters worth a Coppy hold: A hose and dublet; which a Lordship cost, A gawdy cloake (three Manours price almost) A Beaver, Band, and Feather for the head, (Priz'd at the Churches tythe, the poor mans bread) For which the Wearers are fear'd, and abhorr'd Like Ieroboams golden Calves ador'd. This double, treble aged man, I wot, Knowes and remembers when these things were not; Good wholsome labour was his exercise, Down w?? the Lamb, &amp; with the Lark would rise, In myre and toyling sweat hee spent the day, And (to his Teame) hee whistled Time away: The Cock his night-Clock, and till day was done, His Watch, and chiefe Sun-Diall, was the Sun. Hee was of old Pithagoras opinion, That greene cheese was most wholsome (with an onion) Course Mesclin bread, and for his daily swig, Milk, Butter-milk, and Water, Whay, and Whig; Sometimes Metheglin, and by fortune happy, Hee sometimes sip't a Cup of Ale most nappy, Syder, or Perry, when hee did repaire T'a Whitson Ale, Wake, Wedding, or a Faire, Or when in Christmas time hee was a Guest At his good Land-lords house amongst the rest: Else hee had little leasure Time to waste, Or (at the Alehouse) huffe-cap Ale to taste. Nor did hee ever hunt a Taverne Fox, Nere knew a Coach, Tobacco, or the Pox; His Physick was good Butter, which the soyle Of Salop yields, more sweet than Candy oyle, And Garlick hee esteem'd above the rate Of Venice-Triacle, or best Mithridate. Hee entertain'd no Gowt, no Ache hee felt, The ayre was good, and temp'rat where he dwelt, Whilst Mavisses, and sweet tongu'd Nightingales Did chant him Roundelayes, and Madrigals. Thus living within bounds of Natures Lawes, Of his long lasting life may be some cause. For though th'almighty all mans daies do measure, And doth dispose of life and death at pleasure, Yet Nature being wrong'd, mans dayes and date May be abridg'd, and God may tollerate. But had the Father of this Thomas Parr, His Grand-father, and his Great grand-father, Had their lives threds so long a length been spun, They (by succession) might from Sire to Son Have been unwritten Chronicles, and by Tradition shew Times mutabillity. Then Parr might say he heard his Father well, Say that his Grand-sire heard his Father tell The death of famous Edward the Confessor, (Harrold) and William Conq'rour his successor; How his Son Robert wan Ierusalem, Ore-came the Sarazens, and Conquer'd them: How Rufus raign'd, and's Brother Henry next, And how usurping Stev'n this Kingdome vext: How Mawd the Empress (the first Henries daughter) To gaine her Right, fill'd England full of slaughter: Of second Henry's Rosamond the faire, Of Richard Cuer-de-lyon, his brave heire, King Iohn, and of the foule suspition Of Arthurs death, Johns elder Brothers Son. Of the third Henrie's long raigne (sixty yeares) The Barons wars, the losse of wrangling Peeres, How Long-shanks did the Scots &amp; French convince, Tam'd Wales, and made his haples son their Prince. How second Edward was Carnarvon call'd, Beaten by Scots, and by his Queen inthrall'd. How the third Edward, fifty yeares did raigne, And t'honor'd Garters Order did ordaine. Next how the second Richard liv'd and dy'd, And how fourth Henries faction did divide The Realme with civill (most uncivill) war 'Twixt long contending Yorke and Lancaster. How the fift Henry swayd, and how his son Sixt Henry, a sad Pilgrimage did run. Then of fourth Edward, and faire Mistrisse Shore, King Edwards Concubine Lord Hastings (?) Then how fift Edward, murthered with a trick Of the third Richard; and then how that Dick Was by seventh Henries slaine at Bosworth field; How he and's son th'eighth Henry, here did wield The Scepter; how sixt Edward swayd, How Mary rul'd, and how that royall Mayd Elizabeth did Governe (best of Dames) And Phenix-like expir'd, and how just Iames (Another Phenix) from her Ashes claimes The right of Britaines Scepter, as his owne, But (changing for a better) left the Crowne Where now 'tis, with King Charles, and may it be With him, and his most blest Posterity Till time shall end; be they on Earth renown'd, And after with Eternity be crown'd. Thus had Parr had good breeding, (without reading) Hee from his sire, and Grand sires sire proceeding, By word of mouth might tell most famous things Done in the Raigns of all those Queens and Kings. But hee in Husbandry hath bin brought up, And nere did taste the Helliconian cup, He nere knew History, nor in mind did keepe Ought, but the price of Corne, Hay, Kine, or Sheep. Day found him work, and Night allowd him rest. Nor did Affaires of State his braine molest. His high'st Ambition was, A tree to lop, Or at the furthest to a May-poles top, His Recreation, and his Mirths discourse Hath been the Pyper, and the Hobby-hors. And in this simple sort, hee hath with paine, From Childhood liv'd to bee a Child againe. 'Tis strange, a man that is in yeares so growne Should not be rich; but to the world 'tis knowne, That hee that's borne in any Land, or Nation, Vnder a Twelve-pence Planet's Domination, (By working of that Planets influence) Shall never live to be worth thirteene pence. Whereby (although his Learning cannot show it) Hee's rich enough to be (like mee) a Poet. But er'e I doe conclude, I will relate Of reverend Age's Honourable state; Where shall a young man good Instructions have, But from the Ancient, from Experience grave? Roboam, (Sonne and Heire to Solomon) Rejecting ancient Counsell, was undone Almost; for ten of the twelve Tribes fell To Jeroboam King of Israel. And all wise Princes, and great Potentates Select and chuse Old men, as Magistrates, Whose Wisedome, and whose reverend Aspect, Knowes how and when to punish or protect. The Patriarkes long lives before the Flood, Were given them (as 'tis rightly understood) To store and multiply by procreations, That people should inhabit and breed Nations. That th'Ancients their Posterities might show The secrets Deepe of Nature, how to know To scale the skie with learned Astronomy, And sound the Oceans deepe profundity; But chiefly how to serve, and to obey God, who did make them out of slime and clay; Should men live now, as long as they did then, The Earth could not sustaine the Breed of Men. Each man had many wives, which Bigamie, Was such increase to their Posterity, That one old man might see before he dy'd, That his owne only off-spring had supply'd And Peopled Kingdomes. But now so brittle's the estate of man, That (in Comparison) his life's a span. Yet since the Flood it may be proved plaine, That many did a longer life retaine, Than him I write of; for Arpachshad liv'd Foure hundred thirty eight, Shelah surviv'd Foure hundred thirty three yeares, Eber more, For he liv'd twice two hundred sixty foure. Two hundered yeares Terah was alive, And Abr'ham liv'd one hundred seventy five. Before Iob's Troubles, holy writ relates, His sons and daughters were at marriage states, And after his restoring, 'tis most cleare, That he surviv'd one hundred forty yeare. Iohn Buttadeus (if report be true) Is his name that is stil'd, The Wandring Iew, 'Tis said, he saw our Saviour dye; and how He was a man then, and is living now; Whereof Relations you (that will) may reade; But pardon me, 'tis no part of my Creed. Vpon a Germanes Age, 'tis written thus, That one Iohannes de Temporibus Was Armour-bearer to brave Charlemaigne, And that unto the age he did attaine Of yeares three hundred sixty one, and then Old John of Times return'd to Earth agen. And noble Nestor, at the siege of Troy, Had liv'd three hundred yeares both Man and boy. Sir Walter Rawleigh (a most learned Knight) Doth of an Irish Countesse, Desmond, write, Of seven score yeares of Age, he with her spake: The Lord Saint Albanes doth more mention make That she was Married in Fourth Edwards raigne, Thrice shed her Teeth, which three times came againe. The High-land Scots and the Wilde-Irish are Long liv'd with Labour hard, and temperate fare. Amongst the Barbarous Indians some live strong And lusty, neere two hundred winters long? So as I said before, my Verse now sayes By wronging Nature, men cut off their dayes. Therefore (as Times are) He I now write on, The age of all in Britane hath out gone; All those that were alive when he had Birth, Are turn'd againe unto their mother earth, If any of them live, and doe replye, I will be sorry, and confesse I lye. For had he bin a Marchant, then perhaps Stormes, Thunderclaps, or feare of Afterclaps, Sands, Rocks, or Roving Pyrats, Gusts and stormes Had made him (long ere this) the food of worms. Had he a Mercer, or a Silk-man bin, And trusted much in hope great gaine to win, And late and early strived to get or save, His Gray head long ere now had been i'th Grave. Or had he been a Iudge or Magistrate, Or of Great Counsell in Affaires of state Then dayes important businesse, and nights cares Had long ere this, Interr'd his hoary haires: But as I writ before, no cares opprest him, Nor ever did Affaires of State molest him. Some may object, that they will not believe His Age to be so much, for none can give Account thereof, Time being past so far, And at his Birth there was no Register. The Register was ninty seven yeares since Giv'n by th'eight Henry (that Illustrious Prince) Th'yeare fifteene hundred fourty wanting twaine) And in the thirtieth yeare of that Kings raigne; So old Parr now, was almost an old man, Neere sixty ere the Register began. I'have writ as much as Reason can require, How Times did passe, how's Leases did expire; And Gentlemen o'th County did Relate T'our gracious King by their Certificate His age, and how time w?superh; gray haires hath crownd him; And so I leave him older than I found him. Part of this Summers Travels. Or News From Hell, Hull, and Hallifax, from York, Linne, Leicester, Chester, Coventry, Lichfield, Nottingham, and the Divells Ars a Peake. The verse has been extracted from prose text. Passages and Entertainments from London to Leicester, with some observations of the said Town and Shire. Upon Saint Swithins day, I noted well, The wind was calme, nor any rain then fell, Which faire day (as old sawes saith) doth portend, That heav'n to earth, will plenteous harvest send, The morrow being Julies sixteenth day, In my progression I began my way. I need not to relate the towns that lie Just in my way, (as I road through or by) Onely at Mims, a Cockney boasting bragger In mirth, did aske the women for Belswagger, But strait the females, like the Furies fell, Did curse, scold, raile, cast dirt, and stones pell mell, But we betook us nimbly to our spurs, And left them calling us rogues, Knaves, and curs, With other pretty names, which I discern'd They from their old fore-mothers well had learn'd. The reason why they are with rage inflam'd, When as they heare Belswagger nam'd. Is (as report doth say) there dwelt a Squire, Who was so full of love, (or lusts desire) That with his faire tongue, Hippocritick-hood, (By slanderous people 'twas misunderstood) The women were so fruitfull, that they were All got with childe, in compasse of one yeare, And that Squires name, they say, Belswagger was, And from that tale, the lying jeere doth passe, Wherefore the women there will chide and swagger, If any man do aske them for Belswagger. Thence past I on my journey unto Hockly, Where as I saw a Drunkard like a block lye, There I alighted at the sanguine Lion, Where I had meat, drink, and a bed to lie on, The next day I road stately to Northampton, And all the way my horse most proudly stampt on, On Thursday, trotting, galloping and ambling, To Leister, I proceeded in my rambling: There, at the blue Boare I was welcome than Unto my brother Miles, a downright man, Plain dealing, free from flattery, fraud or feare, Who hath liv'd long with reputation there, He's old and honest, valiant, courteous, free: (I write not this for making much of me) But they that doubts on't, let them go and try And if he be a changling, say I lie. That house, King Richard lodg'd in, his last night, Before he did the field of Bosworth fight, And there's a Room, a King to entertain, The like is not in Leister Town again, Th'Assizes then were there, some causes tride, And Law did there the corps and souls divide, Of two offenders, one had with a Knife Stabd his contracted love, and reav'd her life, 'Tother, a wench that had stolne some poor rayment, And fir'd the house, deserv'd the Hangmans payment. King Leir a Temple did to Janus reare And plac'd a Flamine in't, there doth appeare The arched Ovens foure yards thick at least, Wherein they Heathen Sacrifices drest; Like as the Jews in their Idolatry, Offered their sonnes and daughters impiously, To Moloch, Nisroch, Ashtaroth, and Ball: And to those devillish gods adore and fall, So people here, when warre or peace they sought; They offrings unto Janus Temple brought; This was eight hundred forty and foure yeare Before our Saviours birth, built by King Leire, Long after Eltreldred (the Mercian King) A happy and a Christian change did bring, The Temple raz'd the Flamine he defac'd, And there a Christian Bishops Sea he plac'd, Which last but few yeares, for then this Land Was seven-fold yoaked, beneath 7 Kings command, And those Kings still were in perpetuall wars That England was quite spoyl'd with endlesse jars, And in those Garboyles Leister had her share, Spoy'ld, rifled, ransack'd, rob'd, and left most bare, Till Edelfred, with great magnificence, Repair'd and wall'd it strongly for defence. Then did it flourish long in wealth and state, Till second Henry it did ruinate: He in out-ragious fury fir'd the Town, Diswall'd it quite, and cast the Castle down, So nothing but some ruines doth appeare, Whereby men may perceive that such things were. Thus Leister fell, from state superlative, Her fifty churches all consum'd to five. Yet it is faire and spacious at this day, And East, West, North and South 'tis every way Above a mile in length, so that no doubt, The Town's in circuit six large miles about. Henry first Duke of Lancaster in war, In peace, or bounty, a bright blazing Star For buildings in this City is renown'd, Which as time rais'd, time did again confound. Yet one large fabrick there doth still abide, Whereby the good Dukes name is dignifide. And that's an Hospitall or Bead-house, where One hundred and ten men are harbour'd there, From perishing through want, still to defend Those aged men untill the world shall end. Twice every day a Chaplain doth repair To them; and unto God sends prayse and prayer, And Nurses are allow'd to dresse their meat, To make their beds, to wash, and keep them neat: For which they thankefull be to God alone Who rais'd such means to ease the poor mans mone. Good Henry Earle of Huntingdon (renown'd) A free schoole did erect there, from the ground, With means (though meane) sor mayntenance endow'd Two Vshers, and one Schoolmaster allow'd, They teach young lads, such Rules as do belong, To reade the English and the Latine tongue, And when their knowledge is with hope discernd, They in the Greek may learn, and be more learn'd. Newes from Hell, with a short description of the Hell at Westminster. Not from that Hell where souls tormented lye In endlesse Death, and yet shall never die, Where gnashing cold, commixt with flames still burning, Where's entrance free, but never back returning: Where nought but horrour, fiends, and torments dwell. I bring no news from that accursed Hell; Yet mine own merits are of such low price, To barre me from Celestiall Paradise, And sinke me in that horrid Lake infernall, But that my hope and faith is fixt supernall. The Hell I write of is well known to be A place of pleasure, and for all men free, Where wretched Ghosts are not in torments stayd, For all the pains upon the purse is laid. To finde this Hell you need not travell farre, 'Tis understood the high Exchequer Barre At Westminster, and those who thither venter, Do not give Cerberus a sop to enter, For Charons fury, you need never feare it, (Although ten thousand do land somewhat neer it) Within this Hell is good content and quiet, Good entertainment, various sorts of diet, Tables a score at once, in sundry places, Where hungry mouthes fall to, and say short Graces, And then (in some sort) I may parallell This earthly Hell, with the infernall Hell. Hot sweltring vapours, Pots, and Cauldrons boyling. Great vehement fires, with roasting, stewing, broyling; The Cooks &amp; Scullions, all be smear'd and smoak'd, And in their Masters Grease well stew'd &amp; soak'd, And had the Devill a stomack unto it, The Cook himselfe is not the rawest bit, Like as th'infernall Hell doth entertain All commers, so this Hell doth not refrain To give free welcome unto every one If money fayle not, there's excepted None. This Hell is govern'd by a worthy Duke, That Pluto like, his under fiends rebuke, There the tormenting Tapster is control'd, If courteously he Nick not (as he should) He must attend at every knock and rap, His reverend Jugge deckt with a frothy cap, He fils and empts, and empts and fils again Like Sisyphus, he toyles, but not so vain, Like Danaus daughters, taking up, and spilling, He's always emptying, and he's never filling. Thither the Counsellour for comfort comes To rince his toyling tongue, and wash his gums. The Client having Tityus empty maw (His guts tormented with the Vulture Law) He comming to this Hell may finde reliefe, Of comfortable Plumbroath, and Roast Biefe; There, for your solace you may feed upon Whole Seas of Pottage, hot as Phlegeton, And midst those Seas, by art, the Cooks hath laid Small Iles of Mutton, which you may invade With stomack, knife and spoon, or tooth and naile, With these, the victory you cannot faile. Therefore this earthly Hell is easier farre, Then where the miserable damned are, There's no redemption from that black Abisse, And here regresse, as well as egresse is, Therefore they falsly do mistake the story, To call this Hell, which is but Purgatory, For here's no Thraldome, from this place you may Get present freedome, if the shot you pay. Here followeth three Satyricall Lashes or Jerks, given with the Pen of the Authour, at or upon the Devil's Ars a Peak. Pens, are most dangerous Tools, more sharp by ods Then Swords, and cut more keene then Whips or Rods, Therefore (most high and mighty Duke of Dis) Commander where the Lake Avernus is, Great Lord of Limbo, Styx, and Phlegeton, Of Tartarus, Gehenna, Acheron, Most potent Monarch of black Erebus, Prince of the Triple-headed Cerberus, Sole Emperour of Darknesse, and dark works, Master of Hereticks, Infidels and Turks, Arch-flammin of hot Tophets smouldring flames, King of Cocytus, and th'infernall streams, Earle of all Errors, and chief Dominator Of all sins done, by Earth, Ayre, Land, or Water, Viscount, and Baron of large Barathrum, Since I have lived to come so neare your Bum, As is your wicked worships Ars a Peake, Though some men think my Muse is all too weake; I with my Pen doe meane to yerke and ferke ye, And (as I promis'd) with three jerkes will jerke ye. I know that many fooles will jeere and frumpe, That I durst come so neare the Divells Rumpe, And lash with my poore penne Satyricall, This great Don Diego Diabolicall: But I would have him and his friends to know, I jeere him not, for all his Bug-bare show: 'Tis knowne that he, and all that him attend, To any Poet never was a friend: And therefore now I daring him oppose, And jerke his hellish Majesty in Prose. FINIS. 1640. The Praise of the Needle. [Hazlitt, No. 62.] THE PRAISE OF THE NEEDLE. To all dispersed sorts of Arts and Trades, J writ the Needles prayse (that never fades) So long as children shall be got or borne, So long as garments shall be made, or worne, So long as Hemp or Flax, or Sheep shall bear Their linnen wollen fleeces yeare by yeare: So long as Silk-wormes, with exhausted spoile, Of their owne Entrailes for mans gaine shall toyle: Yea till the world be quite dissolu'd and past; So long at least, the Needles use shall last: And though from earth his being did begin, Yet through the fire he did his honour win: And vnto those that doe his service lacke, Hee's true as steele and mettle to the backe. He hath I per se cye, small single sight, Yet like a Pigmey, Polipheme in fight: As a stout Captaine, bravely he leades on, (Not fearing colours) till the worke be done, Through thicke and thinne he is most sharpely set, With speed through stitch, he will the conquest get. And as a souldier Frenchefyde with heat) Maim'd from the warres is forc'd to make retreat; So when a Needles point is broke, and gone, No point Mounsieur, he's maim'd, his worke is done, And more the Needles honour to advance, It is a Taylors Iavelin, or his Launce. And for my Countries quiet, I should like, That women-kinde should vse no other Pike. It will increase their peace, enlarge their store, To use their tongues lesse, and their Needles more, The Needles sharpenesse, profit yeelds, and pleasure, But sharpenesse of the tongue, bites out of measure. A Needle (though it be but small and slender) Yet it is both a maker and a mender: A graue Reformer of old Rents decayd, Stops holes and seames, and desperate cuts displayd. And thus without the Needle we may see, We should without our Bibs and Biggins bee; No shirts or Smockes, our nakednesse to hide, No garments gay, to make us magnifide: No shadowes, Shapparoones, Caules, Bands, Ruffs, Kuffs, No Kirchiefes, Quoyfes, Chin-clouts, or Marry-Muffes, No Cros-cloaths, Aprons, Hand-kerchiefes, or Falls, No Table-cloathes, for Parlours or for Halls. No Sheetes, no Towels, Napkins, Pillow-beares, Nor any Garment man or woman weares. Thus is a Needle prov'd an Instrument, Of profit, pleasure, and of ornament. Which mighty Queenes haue grac'd in hand to take, And high borne Ladies such esteeme did make, That as their Daughters Daughters up did grow, The Needles Art, they to their children show. And as 'twas then an exercise of praise, So what deserves more honour in these dayes, Then this? which daily doth it selfe expresse, A mortall enemy to idlenesse. The use of Sewing is exceeding old, As in the sacred Text it is enrold: Our Gen. 3, 7. Parents first in Paradise began, Who hath descended since from man to man: The mothers taught their Daughters, Sires their Sons, Thus in a line successively it runs For generall profit, and for recreation, From generation unto generation. With worke like Cherubims Embroidered rare, The Covers of the Embroidery antient, Exo 26, 1 Ch, 28. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Tabernacle were. And by the Almighti's great command, we see, That Aarons Garments broydered worke should be; And further, God did bid his Vestments should Be made most gay, and glorious to behold. Thus plainly, and most truly is declar'd, The Needles worke hath still bin in regard For it doth ART, so like to NATVRE frame, As if IT were her Sister, or the SAME. Flowers, Plants, and Fishes, Beasts, Birds, Flyes, and Bees, Hils, Dales, Plaines, Pastures, Skies, Seas, Rivers, Trees; There's nothing neere at hand, or farthest sought, But with the Needle may be shap'd and wrought. In clothes of Arras I have often seene, Mens figurd counterfeits so like haue beene, That if the parties selfe had beene in place, Yet ART would vye with NATVRE for the grace Moreover, Posies rare, and Anagrams, Signifique searching sentences from Names, True History, or various pleasant fiction, In sundry colours mixt, with Arts commixion, All in Dimension Ovals, Squares, and Rounds, Arts life included within Natures bounds: So that Art seemeth meerely naturall, In forming shapes so Geometricall, And though our Country every where is fild With Ladies, and with Gentlewomen, skild In this rare Art, yet here they may discerne Some things to teach them if they list to learne. And as this booke some cunning workes doth teach, (Too hard for meane capacities to reach) So for weake learners, other workes here be, As plaine and easie as are ABC. Thus skilfull, or unskillfull, each may take, This booke, and of it, each good use may make, All sorts of workes, almost that can be nam'd, Here are directions how they may be fram'd: And for this kingdomes good are hither come, From the remotest parts of Christendome, Collected with much paines and industry, From scorching Spaine and freezing Muscovie, From fertill France, and pleasant Italy, From Poland, Sweden, Denmarke, Germany, And some of these rare Patternes haue beene fet, Beyond the bounds of faithlesse Mahomet: From spacious China, and those Kingdomes East, And from great Mexico, the Indies West. Thus are these workes, farre fetcht, and dearely bought, And consequently good for Ladies thought. Nor doe I derogate (in any case) Or doe esteeme of other teachings base, For Tent-worke, Raisd-worke, Laid-worke, Frost-worke, Networke, Most curious Purles, or rare Italian Cutworke, Fine Ferne-stitch, Finny-stitch, New-stitch, and Chain-stitch, Braue Bred-stitch, Fisher-stitch, Irish-stitch, and Queen-stitch, The Spanish-stitch, Rosemary-stitch, and Mowse-stitch, The smarting Whip-stitch, Back-stitch, &amp; the Crosse-stitch, All these are good, and these we must allow, And these are every where in practise now: And in this Booke, there are of these some store, With many others, neuer seene before. Here Practise and Invention may be free, And as a Squirrell skips from tree to tree, So maids may (from their Mistresse, or their Mother) Learne to leaue one worke, and to learne an other, For here they may make choyce of which is which, And skip from worke to worke, from stitch to stitch, Vntil, in time, delightfull practice shall (With profit) make them perfect in them all. Thus hoping that these workes may haue this guide, To serue for ornament, and not for pride: To cherish vertue, banish idlenesse, For these ends, may this booke haue good successe. Here follow certaine Sonnets in the Honorable memory of Queenes and great Ladies, who haue bin famous for their rare Inventions and practise with the Needle. 1 [King David by an apt similitude] King David by an apt similitude, Doth shew with Maiesty, the Church her worth; And to a faire Kings daughter doth allude, Where to her Spouse, he bravely brings her forth, In Garments wrought of Needle-worke and Gold, Resplendent and most glorious to the eye: Whose out-side much more glory did infold, The presence of th'eternall Majesty. Thus may you see Records of holy Writ Set downe (what death or Time can nere deface.) By these comparisons, comparing fit, The noble worth of Needle-workes high grace. Then learne faire Damsels, learne your times to spend In this, which such high praisings doth commend. 2 Katharine first married to Arthur, Prince of Wales, and afterward to Henry the 8. King of England. I read that in the seventh King Henries Raigne, Faire Katharine, Daughter to the Castile King, Came into England with a pompous traine Of Spanish Ladies which shee thence did bring. She to the eight King Henry married was, And afterwards divorc'd, where vertuously (Although a Queene) yet she her dayes did passe, In working with the Needle curiously, As in the Towre, and places more beside, Her excellent memorialls may be seene: Whereby the Needles prayse is dignifide By her faire Ladies, and her selfe, a Queene. Thus for her paines, here her reward is iust, Her workes proclaime her prayse, though she be dust. 3 Mary, Queene of England, and wife to Philip King of Spaine. Her Daughter Mary here the Scepter swaid, And though shee were a Queene of mighty power, Her memory will never be decaid, Which by her workes are likewise in the Tower, In Windsor Castle, and in Hampton Court, In that most pompous roome call'd Paradise: Who euer pleaseth thither to resort, May see some workes of hers, of wondrous price. Her greatnesse held it no dis-reputation, To take the Needle in her Koyall hand: Which was a good example to our Nation, To banish idlenesse from out her Land: And thus this Queene, in wisedome thought it fit, The Needles worke pleas'd her, and she grac'd it. 4 Elizabeth Queene of England, and Daughter to King Henry the eight. When this great Queene, whose memory shall not By any terme of time be over-cast; For when the world, and all therein shall rot Yet shall her glorious fame for ever last. When she a maid, had many troubles past, From Iayle to Iayle, by Maries angry spleene: And Woodstocke, and the Tower in Prison fast, And after all was Englands Peerelesse Queene. Yet howsoeuer sorrow came or went, She made the Needle her companion still, And in that exercise her time she spent, As many living yet doe know her skill. Thus shee was still, a Captive, or else crownd, A Needle-woman Royall, and renownd. 5 The Right Honourable, Vertuous, and learned Lady Mary, late Countesse of Pembrooke. A Patterne, and a Patronesse she was, Of vertuous industry and studious learning: And shee her earthly Pilgrimage did passe, In Acts which were high honour most concerning. Braue Wilton house in Wiltshire well can show, Her admirable workes in Arras fram'd: Where men, and beasts, seeme like, trees seeme to grow, And Art (surpass'd by Nature) seemes asham'd, Thus this renowned Honourable Dame, Her happy time most happily did spend; Whose worth recorded in the mouth of fame, (Vntill the world shall end) shall never end She wrought so well in Needle-worke, that shee, Nor yet her workes, shall ere forgoten be. 6 The Right Honourable and religious Lady Elizabeth Dormer, Wife to the late Right Honourable, the Lord Robert Dormer deceased. This Noble Lady imitates time past, Directs time present, teacheth time to come, And longer then her life, her laud shall last, Workes shewes her worth, though all the world were dumb. And though her Reverend selfe, with many dayes, Of honourable age is loaden deepe, Yet with her Needle (to her worthy prayse) Shee's working often ere the Sunne doth peepe. And, many times, when Phœbus in the West Declined is, and Luna shewes her head: This antient honour'd Lady rests from Rest, And workes when idle sloath goes soone to bed, Thus shee the Needle makes her recreation, Whose well-spent paines are others imitation. To all degrees of both sexes, that love or liue by the laudable imployment of the Needle. If any aske to whom these lines are writ, I answer, unto them that doe inquire: For since the worlds Creation none was yet, Whose wants did not the Needles helpe desire. And therefore not to him, or her, or thee, Or them, or they, I doe not write at all: Nor to particulars of he or shee, But generally, to all in generall. Then let not Pride looke scuruily a-scewe, Without the Needle, Pride would naked goe: Nor yet let scorne, cry pish, and tush, and mew, Scorne is forgetfull much in doing so, Nor yet let any one presume to prate, And call these lines poore trifles, by me pend: Let not opinion be prejudicate, But mend it ere they dare to discommend, So fare thou well, my well-deseruing booke, (I meane, the works deserts, and not my lines) I much presume that all that one it looke, Will like and laud the workemans good designes, Fooles play the Fooles, but tis through want of wit, Whilst I to wisedomes censure doe submit.

I (with applause) have writt, neere seavenscore Books, Yet never fear'd base words, or scurvy looks: Though some detracting spirits snarle and hisse, I (with mine owne hand) doe acknowledge this: Let Rake-hells raile, and Rebels kick and spurne; The Bush shall be unburnt, when they shall burne: Such as would sink the Arke (which doth denote That then Gods Church was in that sacred Boate) More barbarous than the barbarous souldiers were That did refuse Christs seam-lesse Coate to teare; To such as these, and none but such as these, My lines may have a rellish to displease; And I doe say (as better men have said) God is my record, I am not affraid Of Force or Fraude; for he that feareth such, Will never dare t'abide the Test or Tutch: Nor is it flatt'ry that doth cause me write, (My Climactericall doth say, Good Night) And 'tis a Court-like adulating sinne, Which I ne're us'd, nor will I now beginne; He that's offended, let him tell wherefore, And shew some reason why he hath therefore; And where my error is, but shew me it, In all Humility I will submit. Some sattin Momus, or some silken Zoylus, Or Midas puft in plush, or musky Troylus; This was not writt to doe them any pleasure, Nor can their Wisedomes take of it true measure; If such as understand not, are offended, I bid them all come kisse my Muse, and mend it. But sure, as long as God is on my side, What need I care if raskals doe deride; My deere, deere Mother, Englands Church, 'tis she, (In humble duty) drawes these lines from me; For though I am no Clergie-man, I know, That I obedience unto Her doe owe; In Her, I was baptised, and in Her I have been shew'd Truth, and to shun to erre; In Her th'eternall food (most excellent) I have receiv'd, in th'Word and Sacrament, And for Her sake (to vindicate her cause) Expecting neither proffit nor applause, These following lines unto the world I send, Which (I am sure) shall last, till time shall end.

Note the Rare fabrick of his Worships Building, Behold th'Illustrious Splendor of the Gilding, View well the Columns, and the Buttresses, Marke the faire Pompous Porches Glorious dresse, The Pillars, and the Pillasters admire, Looke how the pointed Pyramids aspire, The Obeliskes, Corinthian carv'd work fine Of purest Marble, Ieat, or Serpentine, Of Alabaster, Tutch, or Porphiry, Or of th'admired (mock-Jeat) Ebony; From the Foundation to the Battlement Most sumptuous, stately and magnificent. His Worships Radient Hall, wood-linings pure, Miter'd and Cipher'd, and Reval'd Immure: His Marble Pavement Chequer'd black and white, T'Amaze and Ravish the beholders sight; His Worships faire Glasse-windowes, with his name And Armes, (which shewes from what descents he came) His Worship eats and sleepes, in Roomes, are hung With costly Arras, and himselfe among (I meane his Picture, if right understood) Gentles Allyed, in Marriage, or in Blood; See more, and take note what you see, at length His Worships Altar's Crown'd with Glorious strength Of Massie Plate; His Worships Tables hold Large Purple Velvet Carpets, fring'd with Gold. His Worships Spouse, and Issue; like a Rood Of Glistring Images; his Worships food Approaching, Be uncover'd, Stentor cries; His Worships Waiters bow before him thrice, With servile reverence, humbly stooping low, They pay the duty they his Worship owe. His Worships Chaplaine, twice, (with double grace) In feare and trembling, takes and leaves his place, And (having read his Chapter) still must say, Thus ends your Worships Lesson for the day. His Worships Lady (likewise mighty fine) Adored is, as 'twere a Thing Divine; Her Waiting-woman, and her Chamber-mayd Is sude to, bow'd to, and implor'd and pray'd. Knights Service thus, and Lady Worship, see How odly, madly Gods and this agree. Here followeth the unfashionable fashion, or the too too homely Worshipping of God. Gods Houses, almost like Troyes Ilion, Are also built of course and baser stone, With broken Pavement, Window, Wall and Dore; Well, if but White-lim'd, and then Oaker'd o're; Drillings of Raine, make greene and yellow streakes, And (Where they give him place) the Painter speakes In Creed, Commands, and Prayer, and 'gainst his Will To the Kings foes, puts Dizzie Painter still, Sayes Woodcock was Church-warden, then cries Woe Over the Pulpit, and in mind to show Beggers at dore, how dreadfull to their trade Death is, he sets him working with a Spade. Nine dusty Seats, twelve Tressels, two crack'd Bels, Three broken Halters. And what? Nothing else Goes to a Church? The Chancell hath a Boord Worth nine pence (most unworthy of the Lord) With pretty home-spun Linsey-woolsey spread Under the Linnen, whither (scarce white) Bread And cheape sowre wine, two hob-nail'd Wardens dragge In Gibeons Bottles, and course Pudding-bagge. All manners, and all decencie must be Laid by; as much as bowing of the Knee Unlawfull is, though Paul commands it so, Yet many new pure spirits doe say no. That Kneeling, comes so neere Idolatry; T'avoid which, they will be so mannerly To be Christs fellow, and to sit at's Table, And give his house like reverence as the stable. Thus sawcie Mortals (vile and transitory) Doe rob themselves of grace, and God of glory; These rude behaviours every good man greeves, When Temples are esteem'd like dens of Theeves. Gods Worship this: The great Kings Service! see How odly madly God's and man's agree. The unequall or incomparable comparison. 'Tis strange that some Religions doe allow, That men to stocks and stones shall bend and bow; And that the man that did the Image frame, Must kneele (in adoration) to the same; Imploring aid, and hoping for a good From ragges and reliques, stones, and stocks of wood. Erecting Churches with great charge (profuse) For mans idolatry, and Gods abuse; And think they merit their salvation For impious works of superstition; With Ceremonies such superfluous store, As Pagans, Jewes, and Gentiles ne're had more; With humble bending, bowing, crouching, creeping, With kneeling, crossing, penitentiall weeping, With slavish feare, and fearfull reverence, Preposterous zeale, and blind obedience; They think't too little, all they can or may In serving God, the quite contrary way. On th'other side, a peevish crew doth lye (Most perverse pure, in their impuritie) And they so sparing of their manners bee, They'le move no hat at Church, nor bend a knee; And whilst they dwell in houses seel'd in State, Gods Houses must lye waste and desolate; The consecrated Temples they'le come in, Esteeming Reverence there to be a sinne, And that (for holinesse) there is no ods In manners, 'twixt his horses house and God's. But leaving this Saint-seeming holy crew, Who (in their braines) doe strange religions brew: They have neither Scriptures, examples of Patriarches, Prophets, Apostles, Councels, Ancient Fathers, nor the Primitive first true Church, but all are against them in this point of duty. Whose Grounds have neither Reason, Root or Pith, Which Patriarches were ne're acquainted with, Which from the Prophets were unknowne and hid, Which Christ and his Apostles did forbid, Which Councels, or old Fathers ne're decreed, Nor from the first true Church did e're proceed. If either Separatist, or Schismatique, Or Anabaptist, Hare-brain'd Heretique, From Scripture, Church, or Father could but show That reverently to God men should not bow, In triumph then, they might display their Banners, And shew some reason for their want of manners. To thee (that read'st or hear'st) these lines I send, That art so stiffe in th'hams, thou canst not bend; Thou ought'st (in feare and love) bow downe thy knee To him, whose Grace and Love came downe to thee; Oh fall before him that hath rais'd thee up, And (for thy soules life) drank Deaths bitter cup. Thy Body prostrate, that it may expresse Thy Soules intentions humble thankfulnesse; As hee's thy Maker, duteous honour doe him; As hee's a Judge offended, kneele unto him; The Captive doom'd to hell for his offence, Ought kneele to Him that did redeeme him thence; Fall downe, (and with thy soule) thy body bend, And then (no doubt) thy prayers will ascend; For though Heaven be from Earth, a mighty space, The most High's neer'st the lowly with his grace. An injur'd man oft-times such mercy feeles To pardon his offender, when he kneeles. Judge and condemne thy selfe, and then the fruit Will be, God will not Judgement execute. For free remission of thy sinnes unholy, Thou canst not (in thy gesture) be too lowly; He that's asham'd to worship God, is then Like him that doth deny him before men. Then, if thy soule be touch'd with penitence, Expresse it, with thy bodies reverence; For though God of our kneeling hath no need, To blesse Humility he hath decreed. And not to kneele, when we Gods blessings seeke, Doth shew we neither lowly are or meeke. To bow thy heart, true faith doth thee perswade; And he that made thy heart, thy knee hath made; And since he hath made all, and every part Hee'le have thy knees obedience, with thy Heart: Hee'le have no halfes, he made, and will have all, And there's no halting safe, 'twixt God and Baal. Beware therefore, when God thou com'st before, Thy rude behaviour not incense him more; Thy misery bewaile, upon thy knee And he (from misery) thy soule will free; For as thou often kneel'st for daily Bread Wherewith thy earth-decaying corps is fed; So forth' Eternall Living Bread must thou Both heart and knee, both soule and body bow. The Prodigall with kneeling and with mourning Was grac'd, and feasted at his home-returning. That Christ to man Coheireship doth impart, 'Tis Gods abundant Love, not mans desert; His humble servants here, by him shall be Exalted to Eternall dignitie. Wilt thou, or dar'st thou (thou fraile earthy clod) Be fellow to th'Immortall Sonne of God, Or dar'st thou stand or sit with sawcie pride To entertaine thy Saviour glorifide? Dost thou not know the Great Kings Seale of Heaven Is come from thence to thee, and to thee given, Wherein the pardon of thy sinnes is sign'd, Whereby thou may'st true peace of conscience find? Whereas Christs Holy Spirit present is Wherewith his Grace doth blesse this work of his, Where Bread of Life, the bread doth sanctifie To all that Eat it, in Humilitie: Thou also (in the Cup) by faith may'st see His precious Blood, that deign'd to die for thee; Which signes and figures of Remembrance must Put us in minde that we must firmely trust His Body offred for us, and his Blood Is All in All, the Summe of all our Good. He that Receives this, and will not afford To kneele and thank so Great, a Gracious Lord; Is Atheist, Pagan, or besides his wits, Unworthy of such blessed Benefits. There is the figure of th'Eternall Feast, And thither Grace invites thee as a Guest, The Royall Robe, the wedding Garment there Is set before thee, for thy soule to weare; The King is present, Angels wait on thee, And wilt thou not kneele downe, and thankfull be? And now some proofes I plainly will unfold How good men worship'd God in times of old. Gen. 17. 17.When God (who is for evermore I am) Did promise Isaac unto Abraham: The good old man his duty knew so well, That humbly bowing, on his face he fell. Deut. 9. 18. Moses did fall before the Lord, and pray He would from Isr'el turne his wrath away: 2 Sam. 12. 16.Blest David all night on the earth did ly, And fast and pray in great humility. 1 Kings 8. 54. 2 Chron. 6. 15.King Salomon did to this duty yeeld, That (though his prayer was long) he praying kneeld: 1 Kings 18. 42. Eliah humbly kneel'd, and prayd for raine, And blessed fruitfull showers he did obtaine: Math. 8. 2. Mark. 1. 4. Luke 5. 12. Math. 8. 8. Luke 7. 6.The Leper worship'd Christ, and faith procur'd That (I Will, Be Thou Cleane) was said, which cur'd: When our Humility is of such proofe, To know our selves unworthy that our roofe Christ should come under; then such Grace we win, Mark. 7. 25.That then the King of Glory doth come in. The woman kneel'd and beg'd, and her request Was granted, and the devill dispossest Luk. 8. 28.The man possest, with many fiends fell downe, And all the Legion to the swine were throwne. Luk. 8. 41.When Iairus kneel'd, and did for favour plead, His daughter was revived, that was dead. Luk. 8. 47.The woman with the bloody Issue fell, And kneel'd, and trembled, and she was made well. Among ten Lepers cur'd, Grace bore such sway, That one return'd, and tythe of Thanks did pay. Luk. 17. 16. Our Saviour (humbly) kneel'd and meekly prayd God his heavenly Father for his ayd. Luk. 22. 41. Mat. 26. 39. Mark. 14. 35. St. Peter kneel'd, and prayd unto the Lord, And Dorcas was from death to life restor'd. And blessed Paul with kneeling did implore, Acts 9. 36. 40. That God would blesse his Church for evermore; And when from Tyrus he did make repaire, Acts 20. 36. He (with the rest there) humbly kneel'd in prayer. St. Steven kneel'd and prayd with veh'ment cryes, Acts 7. 60. For his stone-hearted stony enemies. The slave did kneele, and from his Lord did get Mat. 18. 26. Forgivenesse for ten thousand talents debt. Th'Almighty (by himselfe) hath sworne and vowd, Isay 45. 23. God did swear here: and it is not in mans power to make him call it back. Phil 2. 10. Mark 3. 11. Revel. 4. 10. That every knee shall unto him be bow'd, In Heaven, in Earth, all things beneath the same, That every knee shall bowe at Iesus name. The wicked and accursed fiends of Hell In feare and trembling downe before him fell. In Heaven (where endlesse Glories Saints doe crown) The foure and twenty Elders doe fall downe, The non-Conformist may perceive by these c?mands and examples that kneeling and bowing must be used but the Scripture doth not command standing or sitting or disobedience in any place. And worship him that sits upon the Throne, That lives for ever, the blest three in one: There Angels, Heav'ns, and all the Powers therein, The chaunting Cherubin and Seraphin Continually three Holies lowd doe cry Unto the Lord of Sabbothes majesty; The Glory of whose majesty doth fill Both Heav'n and Earth, whose praise is singing still By blest Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, and The holy Church through every Realme and Land; All these doe knowledge him alone to be The Father of infinite majesty; Whose honorable, true, and onely sonne By his obedience, hath our pardons wonne; The Holy Ghost, the comforter of all Such as with stedfast faith for comfort call; To this God, Good and Gracious, Glorious, Great, To him all knees must bowe, all soules entreat; All those that will not bend, such power he hath That he will break them in his furious wrath; Private men must not frame what worship they will.'Tis well t'avoyd will-worship, but 'tis ill To frame what kinde of worship each man will. When in the Temple we doe God implore; 'Tis God, and not the Temple we adore. Exod. 37. 6. 1 Kings 6. 23.The Priest did worship t'wards the mercy Seate, And 'twixt the Cherubins our God entreat; He worship'd neither Seat, nor Cherubins, But only God that takes away our Sinns. And as on Sea and Land, in every place, With humble reverence we must sue for Grace: So in his Church, and houses consecrated, And to his service only dedicated, Wherein Christ Crucified is preach'd, where he In Word and Sacraments doth deigne to be, Sure, in those places, where Gods love is such, All mens best manners cannot be too much. For though we owe God reverence everywhere; Yet in the Church it best becomes us there; When we participate most of his Grace, O, then, and there, shew manners in that place. The Saints in Heav'n doe kneele, and praise Gods name, And Saints on earth must likewise doe the same. O come let's sing unto the Lord, rejoyce In our salvations strength, our hearts and voyce; Psal. 95. Let us (with thanks) before his face appeare, And shew (in him) with Psalmes our Gladnesse there: O, come, let's worship, fall, and kneele before The Lord our maker, let us him adore. This doctrine David to the Church did teach, Which (from those times to these) all good men preach. Only a new fantastick upstart Troope Of proud contentious spirits, scorne to stoope. I have shewd proofes, and more I will produce, How men are bound unto this reverent use. St. Paul repeats the places I have shewd, That every knee shall to the Lord be bowd; Rom. 14. 11. For there's no other name else under Heaven, But Iesus name, by whom Salvation's given. Acts 4. 12. Th'Apostle kneel'd, and told th'Ephesians why, To pray that Grace their faith might fructifie. Eph. 3. 14. In Iesus blessed name, our soules releife And life eternall doth consist in chiefe. Ioh. 20. 31. In all we say or doe, we still must frame To say and doe (with thanks) in Iesus name; Coloss. 3. 17. Beleevers in this name, with faith most steady Are sav'd, and unbeleevers damn'd already. Ioh. 3. 18. This name alone was the Apostle's ayde To dispossesse the devill from the mayd; Acts 16. 18. That from this name no bonds should make him flye, And for this name he willingly would dye. Acts 21. 13. Full of such proofes as these the Scriptures are, Which to all people plainly doth declare That 'tis th'Almighties Mandate and decree, That all, at Iesus name, shall bend the knee. And in all ages, till these times and dayes, The Churches practice it hath been alwayes; And that (amongst us) this duty is not new; Injunct. 52.But Queene Elizabeths Injunctions view: Or else King Iames his eighteenth Canon read; There (by Authority) 'tis published. Archbishop Whitguift if you please to note In's Book, which he 'gainst master Cartwright wrote, Maintaines, that all men must this duty doe; (Imprinted, page seaven hundred forty two.) Lib. 5. §. 30. page 248.And learned Hooker doth the same defend, In that rare Tract and Treatise which he pend, Ecclesiastick Polity instil'd; The true use there, of Kneeling is compil'd, So absolute, acute, and exquisit, That all the Christian world approveth it. Calvins Institutions lib. 1. cap. 13. §. 24. lib. 2. c. 11. §. 12. lib. 2. c. 14. §. 3. lib. 2. c. 15. §. 5. lib. 3. c. 5. in all these places Calvin is plain for the reverend use and practice of this duty.Those unkneeling saucy Separatists Are often falsly called Calvinists: For master Calvin's flat against their side; And they are all from his directions wide: He (in his Institutions) doth allow At Iesus name, that every Knee shall bowe; Those that will read, may (in five places) finde How Calvin clearely hath declar'd his minde. Madde Innovaters, in their Consultations Doe nothing but cry out 'gainst Innovations; Like he that rob'd himselfe, and by and by Cry'd theeves, theeves, and pursude with Hue and Cry. So these men have new fashion'd fangles found, Which have from Scripture or the Church no ground. Whilst we in our Church Government doe hold Not any thing but what's authentique old: Yet vile Impuritans revile the State And Church; when they themselves doe innovate. Sure they are Ignorants or Hypocrites That are inspir'd with these unholy fits; And with a heav'd-up hand, and white of eye, They'le doe a man a mischiefe zealously, And on religious points will stand most stoutly, But in conclusion cozzen men devoutly. These peoples braines are stuft with froath and bubbles, Their concord's discord, and their peace is troubles. He that can measure smoake, or weigh the wind, Or to the Peace the restlesse Ocean bind; Number the Starres, or Sands on Neptunes bounds; Or take great Whales at Sea, with hunting hounds; Make Mountaines swim, stop Rivers in their source, Or stay the Sunne in his Diurnall course: He that can doe all these, hath power and skill To fix these fellowes stedfast in their will. These are our Church and Ceremony haters, That love to fish in foule and troubled waters; Swift in defame, their reason is their will, And Will shall be their reason, they say still. To end this point, they are a sort of youths, Whose judgements still are farthest off from truths. But He that in the Heavens doth reside, Doth see their malice, and their plots deride; And though they rave and raile, our State shall stand Supported only, by th'Almighties hand. And through the venom'd vapours of their spight, Our Churches Government shall shine more bright. Their errours have beene answer'd, quash'd and quell'd, And often (by grave learned men) repell'd Their causes have beene canvas'd and disputed By Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, all confuted, Ecclesiastick Canons, Statutes, Lawes, Decrees, Sense, Reason, all against their Cause; All Institutions, Orders, Decencie, And Ancient Custome tells them all, they Lye. But all these they esteeme at slender rate, For they have vow'd still to be obstinate. They 'have beene refeld by wise-men, grave, and good, And learn'd, and still all these they have withstood; Therefore they are unworthy of Reply From wise men, but from such poore fooles as I, To Answer their poore cavils, they are such, A Sculler's fitter than a Scholler much. I know two Enemies Gods Church resists (The Papists, and Schismatique Separatists) And Shee (alas) like Christ betweene two Theeves, Prays daily for their Pardons and Repreeves. For why? Betwixt the Romane Monarchie, And the severe Geneva Anarchie, Our Church disperseth her resplendent Beames, As blessed Vertue is 'twixt two extreames. For whilst Shee hath a biding in this world, From Wrong to Injury Shee's daily hurl'd, From Scylla to Charibdis, flung and tost, And (did not grace preserve her) shee were lost. And yet Both those, that thus doe her oppose, (One 'gainst the other) are inveterate foes, Yet both agreed, maliciously entic'st, Like Herod joyn'd with Pilate to kill Christ. 'Twas our sinnes kill'd him (as my faith avowes) And shall we rend and teare his sacred Spouse? (The Church I meane) O impious shame of shames! Unworthy are all such of Christian names. The Ceremonies of our Church are three, Which neat, and decent, and convenient bee: Kneeling was one, which I have treated on; The other two I'le not be long upon. The Crosse in Baptisme, (that most Christian Signe) 'Gainst which these seeming Christians doe repine. About some seven and thirty yeares agone, When blest King Iames did grace Great Britains Throne, Canon and Constitution Ecclesiasticall 30, Anno primo Iacobi 1603. The first yeare over England that he reign'd, Canons and Constitutions were ordain'd, Wherein this Ceremony they derive From the true Church that is call'd Primitive. For then the Ethnicks, and the faithlesse Iewes Did both th'Apostles, and the rest abuse, Because they did beleeve and preach Christ dy'd And suffring on a Crosse, was crucifi'd 'Mongst mis-beleevers; all Christians were then Derided and esteem'd the scorne of men; The Christians (deeming all the world as drosse) T'expresse their constant faith, profest the Crosse. The Iewes did mock the Christians; and againe, The Christians gloried in the Jewes disdaine; The scornes of men, not daunted them awhit; The Crosse (their comfort) they rejoyc'd in it, They lov'd the Crosse, and triumph'd in the same, And (for the Crosse) were never fear'd with shame. Since then the Greeke and Latine Church combinde With great applause, and one consent of minde, That (at Baptizings) every Church and Nation Should Signe all Christned in each Congregation With that most Christian Badge, to shew that we From world, flesh, fiend, and sinfull lusts must flee, And under our Redeemers Banner fight 'Gainst sinne, the Devill, and the worlds delight. These reasons plainly doe demonstrate this; This Ceremony now, no new thing is, Nor yet from Rome did first admittance win, For from th'Apostles times it did begin; Yet had it come from Rome, the Roman faith Was Or published. Rom. 1. 8. Famous through the world, th'Apostle saith; And those that will have nothing that was there, Must neither have Gods Church, his Grace, nor feare. The Romish Church was Right, for many yeares, Till ('mongst their wheat) the Envious man sow'd tares: Wherefore we first began to leave her quite, When shee began to mingle wrong with right. Shee parted not from us, but we from her, And we left her in all that she did Erre: As farre as shee leaves Christ, 'tis good that we Should so farre from her Errors sundred be. The Romane Church was Right; but superstition Hath made her Wrong, and altred her condition: Her Errors (not her Essence) we oppose, With prayers and teares we doe resist our foes; And they allow our Service and our Prayers Are good, and that we leave much good of theirs; But let them keep what's good: Let us be glad That we have left them (only) in what's bad. And for the signe o'th Crosse, no man that lives Doth think it vertue unto Baptisme gives; 'Tis but a Ceremony (us'd of old) Which signes Christs sheepe and lambes into his fold; All Emperours and Kings, who Christ professe, All Potentates and Princes (great or lesse) Their Hatchments, Armes, Escoucheons, every one, The figure of the Crosse is formed on; Their Banners, Ensignes, Flaggs, and golden Crownes, The Crosse's figures fix'd for their Renownes: And by the Ball and Crosse, the world may see, That underneath the Crosse the world must be, And by the Crosse they shew (by signes externall) The Christian Faith (professed) is supernall; All Christian Coynes doe, likewise Crosses beare, (But those put not our Puritans in feare) The sight of those, to them are much delicious, They only unto such are superstitious, They love them, with such zeale and verity, They'l never part with them in charity. The Crosse's use prov'd since th'Apostles time, Through th'ancient practice of the Church cald Prime, And in the raigne of th'Emperour Constantine, All Christians that were baptiz'd, had this Signe, And that from thence unto these very dayes; This Ceremony hath been us'd alwayes, By Christians through all Christendome so grac'd, So long a time with great regard embrac'd. Shall any proud Scismatique, impure crew, Dare offer to suppresse't or call it new? It addes no vertue to the Sacrament, Nor is it us'd for any such intent; For after Baptisme's done, our Church doth use To signe with th'Crosse (which wranglers doe abuse) Thus 'tis a decent and indifferent thing, And from it doth no superstition spring; Yet not so' indifferent any should withstand it; It must be; for the King and Church command it; Rom. 13. 1. 2.Th'Almighty doth the Higher Powers ordaine; And Kings beare not the sword for nought, in vaine: And seeing this command is just and good, It neither ought, nor must not be withstood; All power proceeds from God, therefore submit, And scape Gods judgement in obeying it. We must not dare to conster, mould, or fashion 2 Pet. 1. 20.The Scriptures to each mans interpretation; And surely, the unlearned and unstable, 2 Pet. 3. 16. To understand hard Scriptures are unable. The Lords thoughts, and his wayes, are his, not ours, Isay 55. 8. 9.And high as Heaven from Earth, above our powers. Where God commands, weake men must not dispute, We ought to obey the King in love, for conscience sake, especially in such of his commands as are not contrary to Gods word.And where they understand not, there be mute. Then, as the King is Gods Leivetenant here, Obey in conscience, not in slavish feare, And as the Church and State, with paines and cares Ordain'd good Lawes obey'd for many yeares. What bold audacious spirits then are they That King, Church, State and Lawes thus disobey? Ten millions of their braines can ne're devise A book so good as that which they despise; (The Common Prayer I meane) if they should sit Ten thousand yeares, with all their Art and witt, They would prove Coxcombs all, and in the end, Leave it as 'tis, too good for them to mend. These are the Crew that under faire pretences, By flatt'ry cause division and offences, Rom. 16. 17. 18. These serve not the Lord Iesus Christ a jot, They are their bellyes servants (well I wot) With adulating speech, and faire deceit, They doe the hearts of simple people cheat; 1 Cor. 11. 16. Contentious men that doe contention crave; We, nor the Church of God such custome have: And thus to these crosse men I have declar'd How much of old the Crosse was in regard, And though the Papists use it with abuse, That cannot take away the lawfull use; For though a golden Idoll be a curse, That makes not God (well us'd) to be the worse. Materiall Crosses made of wood or stone, (Through zeale) most of them are cast downe and gone, From age to age, the Sires to their succession; Those Crosses stood t'expresse our faiths profession; But when th'abuse of them began to grow, That to those Crosses Sotts would creepe or bow, For this cause (chiefly) they were overthrowne, Abus'd from their first use, were beaten downe; Some 12 years since at Tewxbury in Glocestershire, a precise Churchwarden pulled downe a crosse of stone and caused a hogstrough to bee made of the top of it; but his hogs all ran mad and dyed, and he with his whole family came suddenly to mischances or untimely ends. But our Crosse us'd in Baptisme, still hath beene A signe invisible, yet never seene: Nor doth it on the Infants face appeare That ever any Crosse was figur'd there. Then what madde men are those, that beare such spleene Against a thing, not to be felt, or seene, Yet heard (though hardly to be understood) By many of the perverse brotherhood? For of their constant faith we may despaire Who are affraid of shaddowes in the ayre. And thus much for the Crosse may well suffice To give content to all, except precise. Now, for the Surplice, which is third and last Of Ceremonies, which make fooles agast: Such as doe prize it as a ragge of Rome, An issue of the Whore of Babels wombe; Such as doe hold it (for their Sect) more meete To suffer penance in a milk-white sheete, And think it better doth affect their sight, Than in the Church to see a Surplice white. These Amsterdamnable opinions runne, As fierce as pellets from an Elder-gunne; Their witt's lesse than their reverend beards by halfe, And each of them as wise as Walthams calfe, And wisedome is as thick amongst the rout As Water-grewell when the Oate-meale's out. Yet they are wise enough, with tooth and nayle, To libell, and talke nonsense, rave, and rayle, And with a scandalous and vile intent, To cast contempt upon all government; Now, for an answer to their cavilling, (Who are indeed not worth the answering) Note, what high names the Holy Ghost hath pend, To honour such as on his Church attend; Revel. 1. 2.For their great dignity he doth afford To call them Angels, in his sacred word; To th'Angel of the Church of Ephesus, Of Smyrna, Sardis, and of Pergamus, Of Thyatira, Philadelphia, And of the (luke-warme) Laodicea; To these seaven Ministers St. Iohn did write, And gave them each an Angels Epithite; And heavenly Angels often did appeare, Mat. 28. 3. Mar. 16. 15. Luk. 24. Ioh. 20. 12.In vestures white as snow, bright, pure and cleare: Which doth denote that Church-men ought to be In Doctrine sound, and in integrity, Angelical, white, cleane and cleare, unspotted, Wherefore the Surplice was to them allotted To be an Emblem of pure Sanctitie, And for distinction of their qualitie; Whereby, the ministeriall function may Be knowne, and well distinguisht from the Lay. And as on White a spot is soonest seene, So with Gods Ministers it still hath beene; A Lay-mans crimes like little Glo-wormes glow, A Church-man's like prodigious Comets show; Therefore the Surplice was, on good pretence, Giv'n as a Robe of spotlesse Innocence, To shew (that though all men are sinfull, fraile) Pastors should be most cautious how they faile; This Pope Stephen was a glorious Martyr, beheaded by Decius the 29 Emperor from Iulius Cæsar, of which 29 only 16 did reigne but 45 yeares of 252 yeares time after Christ. And in those times many Popes were put to death by those Tyrants, because they would not deny their Christian faith. Because so many looke on them and prie, And to their conversations have an eye. The Surplice came from Rome, I dare confesse, (What tho, 'tis not to be esteem'd the lesse) Nay more, it was Romes Bishop did ordaine it, And yet that not a jot at all doth staine it. Pope Stephen liv'd, as by Record appeares, Since Christ, two hundred, fiftie and two yeares; And as his Name was Steven, so his fate Was, that he did Saint Stephen imitate. When Decius was the Romane Emperour, That Pope dy'd by that Pagan Tyrants power; He (for his Saviour) suffred Martyrdome, And he ordain'd the Surplice first in Rome. Thus, when the Church was in her prime perfection, This vestment was ordain'd by good direction, For order, ornament, and decencie, And not for perverse Non-conformitie. There were no Brethren then so out of frame To think cleane linnen was the Churches shame; Revel. 6. 11. &amp; 7. 9.No, they beleev'd That long white Robes in Heaven To th'everlasting blessed should be given; Revel. 15. 8.And in that place sev'n Angels did appeare, And they all pure white linnen Robes did weare; Pure, fine, white shining linnen doth expresse The Saints most ever happie blessednesse: And at the Marriage of the Lambe 'tis said Revel. 19. 8.The Church (Christs Spouse) in white shall be array'd. And when our Saviour (graciously) did shew Matth. 17. 2, 3.His Glory, to Iohn, Iames, and Peters view; His face shin'd as the Sunne, his cloaths as white As was the radient luster of the light: Yea, very white as Snow, and that no Fuller Mar. 9. 3, 4.Upon the earth can make so white a colour; And therefore with our glorious Blest Messias, Luke 9. 29.Appear'd two good men, Moses and Elias. Thus spotlesse Innocence, Immaculate, In most pure white was seene in glorious State. Thus Angels, Saints, and blest immortall Spirits (Who are where all true happinesse inherits) And Christ, when he his three Disciples led To Tabor's Mount, and was Transfigured, They all wore Linnen white, (or like the same) They did themselves in their appearance frame; The Saints wore white, as figures mysticall, Christ as a glorious Robe Majesticall. Which shewes Gods Ministers (in Imitation) May weare a Surplice in the Congregation; For men (on Earth) are in the best estate, Who doe the Saints in Heaven most imitate: These Ceremonies (Three) are prov'd to be Past fifteene hundred yeares Antiquitie: And they that murmure, prate, and call them New, Are Corahs, Dathans, and Abirams crew. 'Tis falsely call'd Religion that doth cause Men to resist God's, King's, and Churches Lawes, They being all from Gods decree deriv'd So long us'd, with such charge and care contriv'd, So Tolerable to be undergone, So necessary, easie to be done, So reverend (in their use) discreet, and neat, Most decent (as I did before repeat) That they who 'gainst them doe revile and brawle, Are (in their fiery zeale) Topheticall; 'Tis not Religion, 'Tis Divillitie T'oppose the King, 'Tis bad Divinitie. And what a fine Church were we like to have If these companions had what they would crave? Yet not to wrong their learning in a letter, 'Tis knowne, no men can raile or libell better, As if th'had learn'd of Oyster-wives to prate At th'Universitie of Bellinsgate. Cain sacrific'd, and Iesabel did fast, Prince Absolom some silly fooles embrac'd, So Iudas kis'd when as to kill he meant, So Pilate wash'd, yet was corruptly bent, So Ananias brought his feigned gift, So Satan alleag'd Scripture for a shift: These were all Hypocrites, and so are you, Pretending Truths, intending nothing true: Whose glazen Arguments will bide no hammer, For they are but bad Logick, and worse Grammar. Their suppositions, false mistrusts and doubts They prove with nothing else but lyes and flouts. A Good cause may be spoil'd, and quite disgrac'd By indiscretion, and by words misplac'd: But these mens causes being bad, their course And filthy language makes it much the worse. And these sweet Rules and Grounds they doe professe As mighty Maxims of their holinesse. Such men, who in authoritie are great, With Envie still are round about be-set: They are not only blam'd for doing ill, But for not doing all that all men will. Their honours are so mixt with toyles and cares Which oft (before old Age) doth bring gray haires; Their broken sleepes make us more soundly sleepe, Their unrest doth in rest and peace us keepe, And whilst the Peasant takes his sweet repose, The Peere is round behem'd with cares and woes. No labour's like the labour of the minde, And Kings rich Crownes with pricking Thorns are linde. Shall we be disobedient then to such, Who for our peace disturbed are so much? Shall Hell-hounds dare aspersions base to fling 'Gainst those that thus serve God, the Church and King? No; let's implore th'Eternall Majestie, To guide and guard their true integritie. To draw to end, kind brethren, take advice, In things indifferent be not over-nice, Presume not to binde Princes Wills to yours; Love, and seeke Peace, obey superiour powers; Stand to the Faith, doe more good Workes I pray, And serve not God the cleane contrary way. And now my pen in Quiet shall Remaine, Except some mad-men Rouse it up againe. FINIS. Lenvoy, or Postscript. From wronging of my King, from State reviling, From Libels writing or in Print compiling: From troubling of my coxcombe, braines, or mazzard, From putting my estate or eares in hazzard: From seeking things that are beyond my reach; From dreaming I could all the Clergie teach; From Pride, Vain-glory, and Hypocrisie, From striving to obtaine a Pillory, And from deserving of the triple Tree, Good Lord of Heaven and Earth deliver mee. A SVVARME OF SECTARIES, AND SCHISMATIQVES: Wherein is discovered the strange preaching (or prating) of such as are by their trades Coblers, Tinkers, Pedlers, Weavers, Sowgelders, and Chymney-Sweepers. The Cobler preaches, and his Audience are As wise as Mosse was, when he caught his Mare. The ods or difference betwixt the Knaves Puritan, and the Knave Puritan. And first of the Knaves Puritan. Hee that resists the world, the flesh, and Fiend, And makes a conscience how his daies he spend Who hates excessive drinking, Drabs and Dice, And (in his heart) hath God in highest price; That lives conformable to Law, and State, Nor from the Truth will flie or separate: That will not sweare, or couzen, cogge, or lie, But strives (in Gods feare) how to live and die: He that seekes thus to do the best he can, He is the Knaves abused Puritan. The Knave Puritan. He whose best good, is only good to seeme, And seeming holy, gets some false esteeme: Who makes Religion hide Hipocrisie, And zeale to cover cheating villany; Whose purity (much like the devils Ape) Can shift himself into an Angels shape, And play the Rascall most devoutly trim, Not caring who sinkes, so himself may swim: Hee's the Knave Puritan, and only He, Makes the Knaves Puritan abus'd to be. For (in this life) each man his lot must take, Good men must suffer wrong for bad mens sake. To he that will. Thou that this little Book in hand dost take, Of what thou read'st no false construction make Be not prejudicate, to carp, or grudge, And look thou understand before thou judge: My Muse is Musicall, and runs division, And holds all Critick Cockscombs in derision. The wretch, that true Religion doth despise, Is like the Atheist, that his God denies, And those that do contemne Religious Rites, Must look for portions with the hypocrites: And therefore with all Reverend due respects To Truth, I have displaid some peevish Sects, Full of foule errors, poore, and bare of sence, Yet tending to some dangerous consequence. 'Tis past a Butchers, or a Brewers reach, To pearch into a Pulpit, or to preach; A pot, a platter, dripping pan, or spit, Are for a Ladies Bed-chamber unfit: Rich Hangings, Curtaines, Carpets, garments gay Doe not become a Kitchin any way. A Preachers work is not to gelde a Sowe, Vnseemly 'tis a Iudge should milke a Cowe: A Cobler to a Pulpit should not mount, Nor can an Asse cast up a true account. A Clowne to sway a Scepter is too base, And Princes to turne Pedlers were disgrace: Yet all these, if they not misplaced be, Are necessary, each in their degree, If each within their limits be contain'd, Peace flourisheth, and concord is maintain'd. The good man Iob describes it plain and right, Iob 10. 22. Where order is not, darknesse, and the light Are both alike, for blindefold Ignorance Of perfect wisdome hath no glimpse or glance. But such as 'gainst all order doe rebell, Let them not doe as did Achitophell, 2 Sam. 17 23. To set his house in order home went he, But what became of him, pray reade and see. Kinde Brethren, I doe wish you better fortune, And with tongue, pen, and heart, I you importune To have the patience but to heare, or reade What kinde of fellowes doe you thus misleade; I doe inveigh here with impartiall pen Against no silenc'd, learned Clergy men, Nor any man that understands me right, But will approve these lines which here I write: For let base spight say what it dare or can, I know, what's writ, offends no honest man. I write of some, that with tongue, pen and print Have writ and rail'd, as if the devill were in't. I could name many of that precious crew, And for a taste I will recite a few. First, of one that was a Merchant of Pitchards, Black pots, Double Iugges, and Pipkins, and was forward to preach, not being called or sent. Neare to the lower end of Cheapside late, There dwelt one Knight that sold much brittle plate, As glasses, earthen dishes, pans and platters, Pots, pipkins, gallipots, and such like matters. This Knight the Brethren (by appointment sent To Loving-land, (an Isle) in Suffolk went, And at a Village (Summerlayten hight) A Sermon there was preached by that Knight. His prayer extemp're done, he op'de the book, And Vnto us a Childe is borne, he took To be his Text, and handled it so gravely, That for it did in Yarmouth Gaole, the Knave lie. Knight had to aide him to negotiate, One Gault (a Shoomaker) Ass-sociate, Both which were quickly to promotion risen, Preferr'd from Yarmouth, unto Norwich prisen. From thence Knight was unto the Gatehouse broght Whence upon Baile, his liberty he sought, And was bail'd, but his baile and he both fled To Amsterdam, and there he published Strange Libels, full of mischiefe and debate, Which here were scatterd 'gainst the Church and State. Whereby he to the world did plaine reveale His mallapert, most saucie, purblinde zeale. Another sweet youth in a Basket. One Sidrach Cave made Baskets late in Elie, A constant brother, rais'd up his maids belly: But 'twas in Gandermonth, his wife lay in, His flesh rebell'd, and tempted him to sin; And Cave's wife tooke the wrong most patiently, For which the Brethren prais'd her sanctity. A third Bird of the same Nest. Another (one Iohn Howgrave) dwelt at Yarmouth (Not hot, or cold, but with a meere lukewarm-mouth From country, wife &amp; houshold late he fled To Rotterdam, for's Conscience as he sed; At Iohn Burgaries house, he took his Inne, And woo'd his Hostesse to the Paphean sin. Burgaries wife by him with childe was got, That Howgrave fearing Rotterdam too hot, Fled back to Yarmouth, whence at first he came; His fault was knowne, and he chid for the same: He said it was not he did that vile deed, But sin that dwelt in him that fault did breed; And that the devill should more damnation win, For tempting Gods deare childe to such a sin. Another like that. Of young, and old, both sexes late, a crew were bound from England old, to Engl: new: And staying long at Yarmouth there together, Expecting Ships for passage, winde and weather, A Brother came to Howgraves wife, and kist her, And told her sad newes of a new falne sister, Falne (quoth she) from the Word? I hope not that, And let her fall then, to no matter what: Ah no, shee's fowly got with childe (quoth he) Now out upon her, pray by whom (quoth she) 'Twas by a faithfull Brother he replide, Well, well, quoth she, we all have gone aside; If 'twere a Brothers, deed she could not shun it, But 'thad been naught, had one of th'wicked done it. A precious youth. Also one Spilsbery rose up of late, (Who doth, or did dwell over Aldersgate) His office was to weigh Hay by the Trusse, (Fit for the pallat of Bucephalus) He in short time left his Hay-weighing trade, And afterwards he Irish Stockings made: He rebaptiz'd in Anabaptist fashion One Eaton (of the new found separation) A zealous Button maker, grave and wise, And gave him orders, others to baptize; Who was so apt to learne that in one day, Hee'd do't as well as Spilsbery weigh'd Hay. This pure Hay-lay man to the Bankside came, And likewise there baptiz'd an impure dame, A Basket-makers wife, known wondrous well, In Mosse his Alley he and she doth dwell. As good as the rest. At Brentford dwels the widdow Constable, (As wife as was the Dean of Dunstable) Her husband dy'd, and she great hast did make, Our Church, and Churches doctrine to forsake; Professing purity, chaste, undefil'd, Yet in a Gravell pit was got with childe, And now she bids Religion quite adiew, Turn'd from a Nonconformist, to a Jew. [These kind of Vermin swarm like Caterpillars] These kind of Vermin swarm like Caterpillars And hold Conventicles in Barnes and Sellars, Some preach (or prate) in woods, in fields, in stables, In hollow trees, in tubs, on tops of tables, To the expence of many a tallow Tapor, They tosse the holy Scripture into Vapor: These are the Rabshekaes that raile so bitter, (Like mungrill Whelpes of Hells infernall litter) Against that Church that hath baptiz'd and bred them, And like a loving mother, nurst &amp; fed them, With milk, with strong meats, with the bread of life, Like a true mother, and our Saviours wife. Here followeth the Relation of the most famous preaching Cobler Samuel Howe. Of late a wondrous accident befell, A zealous Cobler did neare Morefields dwell: A holy Brother of the Separation, A sanctified member by Vocation. One that did place his principall delight, To set such as doe walke aside, upright, To mend bad Soales, and such as go astray, Discreetly to support, and underlay. This Reverend translating Brother (How) Puts both his hands unto the spirituall Plow; And at the Nags head, neare to Coleman-streete, A most pure crew of Brethren there did meete, Where their devotion was so strong and ample, To turne a sinfull Taverne to a Temple, They banish'd Bacchus thence, and some smal space The drawers and the Bar-boy had some grace. There were above a hundred people there, With whom few understanders mingled were, Who came to heare the learned Cobler How, And how he preach'd, pray mark, Ile tell you now: He did addresse himselfe in such a fashion As well befitted such a Congregation. He made some faces, with his hands erected, His eyes (most whitest white) to heaven directed: His hum, his stroking of his beard, his spitting, His postures, and impostures done most fitting. A long three quarters prayer being said, (The good man knowing scarce for what he prai'd) For where his speech lack'd either sence or weight, He made it up in measure and conceit. A worthy Brother gave the Text, and than The Cobler (How) his preachment strait began Extemp'ry without any meditation, But only by the Spirits revelation, He went through-stitch, now hither, &amp; now thither, And tooke great paines to draw both ends together: For (like a man inspir'd from Amsterdam) He scorn'd Ne sutor ultra crepidam; His Text he clouted, and his Sermon welted, His audience (with devotion) almost melted, His speech was neither studied, chew'd or champ'd, Or ruminated, but most neatly vamp'd. He ran beyond his latchet I assure ye, As nimble as a Fairie, or a Furie: He fell couragiously upon the Beast, And very daintily the Text did wrest; His audience wondred what strange power did guide him, 'Tis thought no man can do the like beside him. Yet some there were, whose censures were more quicker, Said Calveskin doctrin would hold out no liquor. 'Gainst Schooles, and learning he exclaim'd amain, Tongues, Science, Logick, Rhetorick, all are vain, And wisdome much unfitting for a Preacher, Because the Spirit is the only teacher. For Christ chose not the Rabines of the Jewes, No Doctors, Scribes, or Pharisees did chuse: The poore unlearned simple Fisherman, The poling, strict tole-gathering Publican, Tent-makers, and poore men of meane desart, Such as knew no degrees, or grounds of Art; And God still being God (as he was then) Still gives his Spirit to unlearned men, Such as are Barbers, Mealmen, Brewers, Bakers, Religious Sowgelders, and Button-makers, Coopers, and Coblers, Tinkers, Pedlers, Weavers, And Chimney sweepers, by whose good endeavours The flock may fructifie, encrease, and breed In sanctity, that from them may proceed Whole multitudes of such a generation, As may hold learning in small estimation. The Latine is the language of the Beast, Of Romes great Beast, that doth the world molest; Besides the Bishops speake it when they will, And all the Preachers babble Latine still; Then since it is the Romish tongue, therefore Let us that doe not Antichrist adore, Leave it to Lawyers, Gentlemen, and such Whose studies in the Scriptures are not much. This was the very summe, the root, and pith, The Coblers Lecture was full furnish'd with: And having said his All (his prayer past) He blest his Brethren, and came to his Laste. And in some points, the Coblers case is cleare, Christ chose not learned men when he was here, Not Masters, or expounders of the Law, (For he knew all things, and all things foresaw) For had he chose great men of wealth &amp; arts, The Jewes (with slanderous tongues and hardened harts) Would then have said that what he did, or said Was done by their assistance, and their aide. He therefore chose poore men in meanes &amp; tongue, That by weak means he might confound the strong. Yet this is certain, that at Pentecost, (When on th'Apostles fell the holy Ghost) Each of them spake, each severall language then, And were, and ne're shall be such learned men. Not all the Universities that are, Or were, or will be, with them may compare, For never Bishops, or Divines inferiours, But did acknowledge them for their superiours For sanctity, and working Miracles, For preaching sacred heavenly Oracles, For perfect knowledge, and integrity, For life and doctrines pure sincerity Th'Apostles had more than the whole world had, Therefore the Cobler and his crew are mad. Objection. But some (perhaps) may answer me, that then No humane learning did inspire those men. And that the Spirits mighty operation Gave them the language of each severall Nation: Indeed true Christian Churches have confest, That long agone all miracles are ceast, We must not look for signes and wonders now, God plentifully doth his Word allow, And Tongues are not so easily discern'd, But men must study for them, to be learn'd. For when the Apostles all were gone and dead, By learned men the Gospell was or'espread: And publish'd, and translated every where, Else we had never had a Bible here. 'Twas Schollers, and grave learned men that did Translate the Scriptures, which had still been hid From all Sects, that would Order undermine, Maintaining learning fits not a Divine. Therefore if they (as they doe boast) inherite So large a measure of th'unmeasur'd Spirit, Let them speak tongues, as then the Apostles spake, To work great wonders let them undertake; Let them convert unto the Faith of Christ Whole nations (whom the devil hath long entic'd.) Let them the Moores, and barbarous Indians teach, And to Man-eating Canniballs goe preach: Let all those Brethren leave great Britaines Coast, And travaile where the devill is honour'd most. All you that are this Kingdomes pestilence, I wish you goe, and drive the devils thence; And then my Muse and I, in Verse will tell, You and your Spirit have done wondrous well. A Short relation of some of the mighty Miracles done by the Apostles in the name and power of Iesus. Three thousand Soules, S. Peter in one day, Act. 2. 41. By preaching, turn'd into the heavenly way; He cur'd the Cripple, reade but Acts the third, Strooke dead two deep dissemblers with his word: Acts 5. 1. Cur'de old Æneas, palsied, weak, and lame, Acts 9. 34. These things Saint Peter did in Iesus name. Cur'd people with his shadow, and reviv'd Tabitha (whom Death had of life depriv'd, Acts 9. 40, And after (fetter'd) in close prison shut, An Angell him at liberty did put. Let me see one of you such rare things doe, And then Ile say you have the Spirit too. Saint Paul gave Sergius Paulus heavenly light, Acts 12. 7. Inchanting Elimas he reav'd of sight; Did Lidia and the Jaylour both convert, Acts 13. &amp; 16. And did the holy Ghost to twelve impart, Acts 19. 16. And they straitwaies spake severall tongues most plain, And I believe ne're went to schoole again. If Napkins or handkerchiefes did but touch The corpes of Paul, the force of faith was such, That fiends did flie, and vexed soules had rest; And from possest men devils were dispossest, And were but some of you well hang'd or whip'd, And that your shirts were from your corpses strip'd Or else your whip, or halter well would try, If (by their touch) they'd make the devils flie, And leave possession, I dare lay my life There's many a man would use them on his wife. But no such vertue doth from you ensue, For if there did, the devill would flie from you. Sweet Brethren of the Sect of Ignoramus, You that despise Te Deum and Laudamus, You that doe for our humane learning blame us, I wonder what Religion you would frame us; You, without any learning, barbarous, rude, How dare you sacrilegiously intrude In Church-affaires, not being call'd or sent, And with your brazen faces impudent, To pick Gods secret Closset ope, and pry (Most saucy) In th'Almighties secrecy: Is't not enough, you have his Will reveal'd, But you'le needs know his secret will conceal'd, Break up the closset doore, and boldly get Into th'eternall, heavenly Cabinet. This is a theft contemptible most high, (Transcendent Felony and Burglary) And those proud thieves, at doomes day must not looke To be repriev'd, or saved by their booke. Some there have been, so malapertly mad, To guesse what talk Christ with the Doctors had: To know where Moses body buried lies, Where Edens garden was, or paradise, What God did doe before the world he fram'd, And where hell stands (appointed for the damn'd) These curious Constables would search and peepe Through heaven, earth, sea, aire, and th'infernal deep, And for their needlesse studies, paines, and care, They do conclude (like Cox-combs) as they are, In boasting knowledge they themselves advance, When all their skill is blinded ignorance. All you of this pure self-conceited Sect, That brag your selves to be the Lords Elect, Me thinkes it is too much for you or yours, To be Gods Courtiers, not his Counsellours; Where have you that rare revelation found, The Scriptures closest mysteries to expound: Is it because you wit and learning want, Or will the truth dwell with the ignorant: Must the best preachers be unlearned fooles? Then downe with Universities and Schooles, Your Libraries, your Halls, and Colledges, If ignorance surpasse your knowledges. The word of God was faithfully translated By learned men, o're-spread and propagated: 'Twas done by Schollers, had it not been done Till you had don't, we all had been undone. Ye'r bid to search the Scriptures 'tis confest, You are not bid the Scriptures sence to wrest, To metamorphose, alter, wring, and wrie Gods Word according to your fantasie, Ye 'have leave to heare, or reade it, 'tis not fit You, or your Kennell should interpret it; For should we trust to your interpretation, We should have an unhandsome Congregation. When God declar'd his Law in dreadfull thunder Upon Mount Sinai, full of feare and wonder, Exod. 19. 12.'Twas present death to any that was there, That dar'd to touch the hill, or come too neere. When as the Ark was back return'd again, That seven monthes with the Philistines had lain, Then fifteen hundred Bethshemites were strooke 1 Sam. 6. 19.Stark dead, for daring in the Ark to looke. When Vzzah, fearing that the Ark would fall, 2 Sam. 6. 7.Put to his hand, was straight strook dead withall, His office only was to drive the Cart, To touch the Arke was no part of his part. Since Vzzah for his good will to hold up The falling Ark, did taste deathes bitter cup; Since those that once to looke into it dar'd, Or those that toucht Mount Sinai were not spar'd, What can a Cobler look for, or a Knave, Who in the Church (or Arke) no function have? Yet dares most saucily to preach and prate Against all orders, learning, Church, and State. It is most lamentable that so far, Men so besotted, or be-devill'd are, That witlesse Rascals are held more divine Then Ierome, Ambrose, Gregorie, Augustine, Or all the ancient Fathers (in a word) Their learnings and their labours held absurd By scabs, and varlets, of no worth or merit, But impious boasting of th'inspiring Spirit; And had each one of you his right and due, Your spirit should be sharply whip'd from you, And when you felt the acutenesse of the lash, You would esteem your doctrine Balderdash. For in Saint Austins time, he made complaint, That eighty two Sects did the Church attaint; Since when, could I all Heresies recount, The number (trouble) treble will amount; Yet in that Fathers daies, that reverend man Did ne're heare of the Sect call'd Puritan, And sure the name of Puritan doth yeeld, A good mans nickname, and a bad mans shield, It is a cover for a cheating Knave, And 'tis a jeare, a good man to deprave; But both the good and bad, what e're they be, They get no name of Puritan from me. I write of Separatists, and Schismatiques, Of shallow-pated, harebrain'd Heretiques, Such as doe make the Text a Lesbian rule, Whose faith or reason (like the Horse or Mule) Whom neither Law, or sence can curb or bridle, Who ne're are well imploy'd, nor never idle. A man may well compare those Separatists Unto the hot Gun-powder Romanists: For though they doe each other deadly hate, And one the other faine would ruinate, Yet both in their conclusions doe agree, The ruine of our Church and State to be. Their head's (like Sampsons Foxes) sundred wide, But yet their tailes are fast together ty'd; For both doe joyntly joyn, and both desire, With fire-brand zeale to set our Corn on fire. To spoile our Government established, And (through the world) most famous published, They joyne together to consume and burne, And with confusion waste and overturne All ancient order, rule, and decency, And doctrine, from the prime antiquity. Thus both the grounds, &amp; aimes of both those Sects Agree both (in their tailes) for their effects, How er'e their heads, East, West, South, North, may sever, Their ends are one, to seek our downfal ever. And of these two opposers (I'le bar swearing) 'Tis hard to know which barrell's better Herring: But (of the twaine) a man shall alwaies finde The Schismatique most obstinate inclin'd, And the more ignorant he is, the worse, Most stubborne, sencelesse, shallow in discourse; The Papist makes some shew of wit and sence, And seeming reason for his false pretence, And from him I may something gain, whereby My faith (more firmly) I may fortifie; For though I doe not credit his dispute, Yet (by disputing) I may gaine some fruit. But from the other side I dare presume, I shall have nothing else but froth and fume, With hasty answers, peevish, testy, snappish, Untoward, wayward, nonsence, fruitlesse, apish. These, none but these hold learning in disdain, And all for use divine, accurst, and vaine, All humane knowledge therefore they detest, Th'unlearn'd (they say) do know the Scriptures best: That humane learning breeds confusion, Most fit for Ægypt, Rome, and Babylon, And that the learned ones were, are, and shall Be ignorant of humane learning all. These with some other idle fancies mix'd, In their unfix'd opinions are all fix'd. But stay (my Muse) hold, whither wilt thou gad? The learned Reader sure will thinke thee mad, Because thou art so tiring, tedious, long About these Screetchowles with thy Cuckoes song: And though I seeme those Caitiffes to condemne, Yet idle babling makes me seeme like them, 'Tis best therefore, no longer time to spend, But some few lines, and briefly make an end. [A zealous brother did a sister meete] A zealous brother did a sister meete, And greeted sweetly in the open streete; Thou holy woman, where hast been said he, I came from a baptizing Sir (quoth she) Pray whose childe was it (he again requires) She answerd, such a Taylors in Black-fryers, Hee's one of us, the man reply'd again, Hee's one (quoth she) that doth the truth maintain; Quoth he, what might the childe baptized be? Was it a Male She, or a Female He? I know not which, but 'tis a Son she said, Nay then (quoth he) a wager may be laid; It had some Scripture name, yes, so it had Said she, but my weak memorie's so bad I have forgot it, 'twas a godly name, Though out of my remembrance be the same: 'Twas one of the small Prophets verily, It was not Esay, nor yet Ieremie, Ezekiel, Daniel, nor good Obadias, And now I doe remember, 'twas Golias. [Another sister (as the Spirit rap't her)] Another sister (as the Spirit rap't her) Said to her Boy, come sirrha, reade a Chapter; The Boy por'd on the Book, and fumbling sate, And had more minde to be at Ball or Cat; His mother said, why dost not reade thou knave, The Boy ask'd her what Chapter she would have: Thou paltry Imp (quoth she) canst thou finde none 'Twixt Genesis, and Revelation; To learne thy duty, reade no more but this, Pauls nineteenth Chapter unto Genesis. [On London Bridge I lately did confer] On London Bridge I lately did confer About some businesse with a Stationer: A young man came into the Shop, and sought Some holy Ballads, which he view'd and bought, And there he pray'd the Shop-keeper to looke The Epistles of Saint Ovid (a fine Book) Upon Saint Peter, Paul, Iohn, Iude, or Iames, They will not put the Saint unto their names, But yet their ignorance impure, precise, A heathen Poets name can Canonize. [One Mapleton, at Reding late did dwell] One Mapleton, at Reding late did dwell: Because his flesh did 'gainst his minde rebell, He cut it off so close unto the stumpe, That he scarce left himselfe a pissing pump; And hee's one of those wise men, and 'twere good That all the Tribe of his sweet Brotherhood Would follow his example on themselves, Then they would not beget more froward Elves: Then peace and rest our Church and State should gain; All windmills, and vagaries of the brain Would from unquiet England banish'd be, And from disturbance we should soon be free. These, with the rest (unknowne) may be compar'd, Whose love to learning I have plain declar'd. To wofull passe our Church were quickly brought: If these companions had but what they sought, From Rome, from them, from all that wrong us thus Good Lord of Heaven and Earth deliver US. AMEN. Postscript. If Prelates have by fraud, or frailty slip'd, My Pen shall not in Gall of Aspes be dip'd; I'le pray we may have better in their places, Whom Grace may guide, to shun the like disgraces; Let tradesmen use their trades, let all men be Imploy'd in what is fitting their degree, And let the Pastors Urym, and his Thummim Be upright, and sincere (as doth become him) Let each man doe his best, himselfe t'amend, And all our troubles soone will have an END. 'Tis madnesse, that a crew of brainlesse blocks Dares teach the learned what is Orthodoxe. RELIGIONS ENEMIES. WITH A BRIEF AND INGENIOUS Relation, as by Anabaptists, Brownists, Papists, Familists, Atheists, and Foolists, sawcily presuming to tosse Religion in a Blanquet. The verse has been extracted from prose text. A Pedlar and a Romish priest in a very hot Discourse, full of Mirth, truth, Wit,Folly, and plain-dealing. A Poland Pedlar went upon a day, Vnto a Romish Priest to learne to pray; The Priest said Pedlar get thee to the cloister And learne the Ave and the Pater Noster. Pedl. Now good sir Iohn (quoth he) what talk is that I heare you speak, but God in Heauen knowes what. Priest. It is that worthy holy Lattin letter Doth please the Lord wel and our lady better. Pedl. Now good Sir Iohn, I know not what they be The Lattin tongue is heathen Greeke to me. Priest. Pedlar if thou to me wilt but repaire Within one Month, I'le teach thee Lattin Prayer. And though thou understand not what thou sayst, Thou shalt speake pretty Lattin when thou prayest Pedlar To pray so sir, is onely but in saying, In words, not sence, a prating, not a praying; Shall I that am a man of perfect age, Talke like a witlesse parret in a Cage. Priest. A parret can but prattle for her part, But towards God hath neither mind or heart. Then seeing I have head and heart to pray, Shall not my heart know what my tongue doth say? For when my tongue talkes, if my heart mis-carry, How quickly I may marre your Ave Mary? And I sir having many things to seeke, How should I speed not knowing what I speake. Priest. God understands all tongues, &amp; knows, &amp; he The thoughts and secrets of the heart doth see. Pedl. Then if I think one thing and speak another, I wrong my selfe, and Christ, and his blest Mother; For when I pray they would my pack repaire, Your Ave mary is a fruitlesse prayer. Priest. The Latin prayers are but generall heads, For our Reliefes in all our wants and needs: The Latin serves us as a Liturgie, As curious Arts directs Chirurgery, And in that language Masse is said and sung, For private things pray in thy Mother tongue. Ped. Then I must have a tongue, sir Iohn, for either, 1 for the Mother and 1 for the Father. Prie. Thinkst thou the Mother doth not know such small things, Christ is her Son man, and he tells her all things. But where did that blest Virgin learne her Latin, For in her daies was neither Masse nor Mattin, Nor yet one Priest that Latin then could speake, For holy words were Hebrew then or Greeke, She never was at Rome, nor kist Popes feet, How came she by the Masse faine would I weet. Priest. Pedlar, if thou beleeve the Legendary, The Masse is older farre then Christ or Mary, For all the Patriarkes both more or lesse, And great Melchisedeck himselfe said Masse. Pedl. But good sir priest, spake al these Fathers Latin And said they Masse in golden Coapes or Satin; Could they speake Latin long e're Latin grew, (For without Latin no Masse can be true) And you that would inforce us to this taske, Me thinkes 'tis like a may-game or a masque. Priest. Well Pedlar thou art too too curious, Thy pur-blinde Zeal's fervent, but furious, I rather would a hundred monkes direct, Then such an ignorant of thy mad sect; This thou must know, this cannot be deni'd, Rome govern'd all when Christ was crucifi'd. Rome, Heathen then, but afterwards converted, And grew so honest, and so holy-hearted, That now our Emperour is turn'd to a pope, Whose Holines (as you have heard I hope, Hath made a Law that all the world must pray In Latin language to the Lord each day; He's Christ's full Vicar, and Ile boldly say, That what he doth command we must obey, He bids us pray in Latin, even so We must doe, where we understand or no, He hath full power to confound or save, And who dares then but doe as he will have. Pedl. This purpose to some purpose puts me back, And hath more points, then pinnes are in my pack, What ever power you give unto your pope, He cannot make a man an Ape, I hope, And if he be full Vicar to our Lord, Should not his words and Christs keepe one accord. Priest. Doubtles they doe, and never are contrary, In Pater noster, Creed, or Avemary. Ped. But Christs Disciples when they made their motion, Vnto their Master, how to make devotion, As I have done to you (sir Iohn) to day; I pray you in what tongue bade he them pray, Christ did not one word Latin to them speake, Their talke was then all Siriack, Hebrew, Greeke, He bade all Nations pray after one manner, But bade not all take Latin for their Banner: Your Latin is but one of the Translations, Why should it then exclude all other Nations; And on my soule, sir Iohn, if I doe say, In mine owne mother tongue when I doe pray Lord helpe me, Lord forgive me all my sinnes, Yea (why not) Lord supply my packe and pinnes. And every thing whereof I stand in need, (For this depends upon our daily bread) I hope in God that I shall speed as well, As if in Latin I my wants did tell: And since some tongues have more antiquitie Then Latin, were it not iniquitie To force all people to pray like the Pope, No good (sir Iohn) you'l not say so I hope. Priest. Wel pedlar, one thing I would faine make plain, Return we to our Lady back again, And if thou hadst as much capacitie As roving wit, with great audacitie, The case is cleare, that Virgin Mary meeke, Could all and every tongue and language speake. Hast thou not heard man how the Holy Ghost, Came downe like cloven tongues, at pentecost, And fill'd the house where all the 12. were ready, And one tongue truly lighted on our Lady, And thinke not that I talke of toyes and dreames, Aske but the Reverend Jesuites of Rhemes, And what they write of this but wisely note. Ped. In faith sir Iohn it is not worth a groat; Will I beleeve't thinke you because they say it; Priest. Nay but they prov't as no man can denay it; Saith not the Text, that when the Lord ascended, Vnto the 12. he earnestly commanded, That from Ierusalem they should not goe, Vntill the Comforter did come, and so Act. 1. They all conjoyned with one joynt consent, And to an upper roome together went, Where Mary was and others whole six score, That with the 12. did daily God adore. Then (sayes the text) when Pentecost was come, They were together then both all and some, And all were filled with the Holy Ghost. Ped. Now good sir Priest you count without your Host, I see well that your Rhemish Jesuites tongues, Hath cloven the text even to the very lungs. That (ALL) for which you reckon up six score, Is here meant onely of the 12. no more; Nor Mary is not named there as than, What need we then beleeve it, holy man, On with your spectacles sir Iohn and read, And credit this as one point of your Creed, The Holy Ghost did fall upon no more, Then he was promised unto before: Now he was onely promised to the twelve, Looke on the text, I pray, and iudge your selve; Speake man, and be not silent, I am sorry, To see you ignorant of such a story; For shame, let not a pedlar with his packe, Put you with all your Sophistrie to wracke. For as the Stories in themselves are divers, Flowing and falling into sundry Rivers, In divers Chapttrs so they stand divided, the 1. &amp; 2. chap. So that the case may clearely be decided; For when those 6. score were at first convened, There was another mysterie then meaned; To wit, Mathias free Election, And so Saint Peter gave direction, That all those six score then should beare record Of their proceedings then before the Lord: The choosing of a pastour was in hand, Which without Churches knowledge cannot stand, And so Mathias, (by the power of Heaven) By lot was tooke as one with the Eleven. Then (saies the the Text) all these together were, What all these were doth very plaine appeare, To be the 12. in the last verse before, And not make Leape Yeare of eleven verse more. To draw all backe to that hundred and twentie, Indeed this way should have tongues in plentie, They differ in 12. verses, the Text saies, Besides the time is different full 10. dayes, The first upon the day the Lord ascended, The other when the holy Ghost descended. Such glaZen arguments will bide no hammer, For they are but bad Logick and worse Grammer; As for the Holy Ghost 'tis verifide, His comming downe, unto no Law is tide; Sometimes invisible, and sometimes seene, As diversly at divers times hath beene, Few needes to see his comming with their eyes, His workes are witnesses which may suffice; And so Saint Paul this gift found privately, By Annanias hand assuredly. Act. 9. And so, sir Iohn, to shew you all my packe, And let you see my breast as well as backe; I wonder yee consider not the end, Why God the Holy Ghost in Tongues did send: Know ye not women are forbidden preaching, Know ye not tongues were onely given for teaching; Women (at home) have hardly leave to speake, But they take leave, and often silence breake; Their husbands must permit their tongues to walke, And therefore, in Gods House, they may not talke: And then, sir Iohn, what worship doe you win Vnto our Lady, when you bring her in As a Companion with the whole six score, Who gat the Holy Ghost and she no more, And where the Pope hath made her Queen of heaven, You make her here like one of the Eleven, In this, her dignitie doth seeme to fall, You thrust her to the Kitchin from the Hall. And this is also one of your rare Themes, Held by your reverend Jesuites of Rhemes, That Latin came not with the Holy Ghost, VVhen as the tongues came downe at Pentecost. Now if it came not then I pray, expresse How came it by that perfect holines, That in it onely, and no other tongue, Both Masse and matins must be said and sung. Your last refuge will be unto the Pope, So knit up all together in a Rope. Pri. Wert thou at Rome, &amp; half these words didst speak, Pedlar it were enough thy neck to break; But here you live, and talk and prate secure, And undervalue that blest Virgin pure, Yeelding no honour, or no adoration To her, or to her dayes of celebration. (Goe but to Spaine, and shew thy vild condition, Thou shalt be tortur'd in the Inquisition.) Her Miracles, of small worth you esteeme, Her merits at low value you misdeeme, Her sacred Reliques you condemne, dispise, And all her attributes you much misprise: Thou saist with six score I doe make her share, Your selves will her with your course wives compare, Shame and confusion doth to all belong, Who dare the best, most blest of creatures wrong. Pedl. Indeed (sir Iohn) you come upon me now, With some things which my faith doth disallow, I pray you to consider but a little, You give her many a title and a tittle, For which you have no warrant in the word, And yet pursue us both with fire and Sword, As Heretiques, for doing not as yee doe, Yet, what the word bids and no more that we doe; Thinke you that anie man can be so mad, As to hold Christ his Saviour, and so bad, As to hold Mary for his Saviours Mother, And not to love her farre above all other, Above all Creatures, she was full of grace, And sure in Glory she hath supreme place And eminence, all other Soules transcending In joy and blisse, that never shall have ending. The Holy Ghost inspir'd her beyond measure, She was possest with Heaven &amp; earths whole treasure, And grant she could speake Latin, and all Tongues, Yet Masse or Mattins to her not belongs. Of all that mortall were she was the best, And her immortall soule is now most blest. Her memorable Honour to preserve, Her dayes of celebration we observe, The Feast of her Annuntiation, Her cleare and pure Purification, The Church (in reverence) hath ordain'd these dayes, On which we should send up our prayers and praise, To our good God, whose mercie was so great, To leave his glorious and immortall Seate, And to the blessed Virgins wombe he came, And tooke on him our filthy sinne and shame; And on these dayes we pray that we may be, The Virgins followers in Humilitie, That our true meeknesse, and our lowlines, May raise us to eternall blessednes; We hold it the sure way to our salvation, To follow her in holy imitation; Through heavenly influence her excellence, Must be admir'd with love and reverence, And those that dare compare most sawcily, Their wives or mothers with her sanctitie, Are sawcie knaves in pride and ignorance, Or Atheists, fit to lead the hang-mans dance; We love her then, though we beleeve not in her, Nor (by will-worship) doe we thinke to win her; We hold her blessed for Christs flesh conceiving, But farre more blessed for Christs faith receiving: She was his mother, so 's the Church his wife, Which was to him much dearer then his life, Now if that one could fall at oddes with th'other, He would respect his wife before his mother; For who so to him once a wife doth take, Must father, mother, friends and kin forsake. And this is every Spouses carriage, But most in this spirituale marriage, As Maries mother of Christs humane life, She's but the Daughter of his heavenly wife, By which meanes onely, faith doth me perswade, Of Christ blest body she's a member made; Whereby these glorious Titles she hath won, Maid, mother, wife, and sister to her Sonne. All this sir Iohn I doe but briefly say, To let you see you play us much foule play. Pri. Well Pedlar, tho that pack about thou beare, Th'art some apostate Monke or Frier I feare, Of Luthers love, or Calvins cursed crew, And sent abroad such businesse to brew, Disguised like the person of some Pedlar. Ped. No faith (sir Iohn) I am not such a medler, Nor have I mind or meanes, so high to mount, A little I can read and cast account, My wits are weake to utter Rime or Reason, I know not what you call your Kerrieleison. So help me God (sir Iohn) I know no better, Nor in your Latin can I read a letter, For Latin is a Language admirable, And my poore friends and parents were unable, To purchase one scrap of it, for my share, And sure without it I can sell my ware, And though I have no Latin, yet I can Aske what I want of either God or man, In mine owne mother tongue, I know and see, How simple soules by you abused bee. And how your doctrine half our praiers would carry, From Christ our Saviour to the Virgin Mary, I also doe perceive how you doe frame, Strange innovations to that heavenly Dame, Ascribing her that honour, which to none Is due, but onely unto God alone: Of which she takes small notice, nor will she For it, at any time your helper be. Priest. Read but the Legend, Pedlar, and ther view Her miracles, approve her honour due, For which the Pope in Latin doth preferre, That Masse and matins must be said to her. Read, and consider, and believe it well, Or else thou art at least half wayes in hell. Ped. Sure Hell is not within the Popes commission, Though purgatorie, and the Inquisition, Are things which he himselfe of late created, Yet of small worth, by wise men they are rated; I answer as I oft before have said I love, and reverence that blest mother maid, But I beleeve in God, and when I pray, Christ help me (when my soule or corps doe stray) And so what e're I either have or want, I neither pray to he or to she Saint; And as for Tongues, I have but one, no more, And wot ye well, although I had six score, I would conforme my selfe to Pauls commanding, Pray with my tongue, pray with my understanding. Think you the twelve, when they receiv'd the tongues, Talkt, and knew not whereto their talk belongs, Yeelding a sound not knowing what they said, Idle in preaching, ideler when they pray'd, No, each of them knew well what he did say, And why not we (sir Iohn) as well as they; For since each man hath one tongue at command, Shall men speake tongues they do not understand? Alas good sir, had I been train'd at Schoole, As I am but a sillie simple Foole, A hundred Questions more I might have moved, But here I cease for feare to be reproved, For these few doubts I learn'd in sundry places, Me thinkes such men as you should cleare all cases. Priest. Now Pedlar, I confesse thou putst me to it, But one thing I will tell thee if thou'lt doe it; If to our Prior thou wilt with me goe backe, Perhaps he will buy all that's in thy packe, And teach thee better how to pray then any, For such a holy man there are not many, Be here to morrow Betweene six and seven, And thou wilt find thy selfe halfe waies in Heaven. Ped. Content sir Iohn, but there is one thing more, I must have your opinion in before, Suppose the holy Priour have no leisure, To talke of every purpose at our pleasure, Your Booke which is the golden Legend nam'd, (Wherein as many lies as lines are fram'd) And, on my conscience, I doe thinke that you, Doe know the most on't to be most untrue; And therefore tell me sir before you goe, Whether your selves beleeve it, yea or no. Priest. Yes verily we doe beleeve it all, And hold it holy and authenticall. Ped. Then Ile repeat a tale or two in prose, Which few wise men beleeve as I suppose. What think you now (sir Iohn) is this good stuffe, It edifies me, much like blind man buffe; Is't not a shame, that you these things dare doe, To wrong poore people, and our Ladie to; You have no starting hole, nor no excuse To cover or to colour your abuse; But by your leave, I'le tell a tale or twaine In prose, and fall into our Verse againe. And thus the Booke you brag of, far excels The lyes of Jewes, Turkes, Moores, and Infidels; And sure the Heathen, hearing of these lyes, The Christian Religion dispise; He that will one day guerdon good and bad, T'whose word we must not dare abate or adde, Against those he will draw his vengefull sword, That mingle fables with his sacred Word. Pri. Thy blinded Zeale my very heart doth grieve, Thou understandst not what thou should believe, Thinkst thou so many Grave and learned men, Have liv'd and dy'd in bleare-ey'd errours den, Dost thinke all Popes, all Cardinalls, all lyers, Abbots, most zealous Monkes, most holy Fryers. Dost thinke all these for many a hundred yeare, Did not professe and know the Truth sincere? These men maintain'd the Church in glorious state, Till Luther and curst Calvin 'gan to prate. Ped. Like as a Squirrill skips from tree to tree, Euen so (sir Iohn) you from the matter flee: Our talke was Latin, and our Lady first, And you to other arguments out burst. I tell you I that Virgin love and honour, Although my prayers doe not wait upon her, Nor doe I hold her Reliques of such price, To raise soules to the heavenly Paradise. You her suppos'd apparell doe adore, Haire-lace and Slippers (which she never wore) Her Combe, her Girdle and her Gowne of filke, Her apron and the pot that held her milke, Her cloake, her Hankerchiefe, her Hood, her Haire, To these you mumble many a Latin prayer, And therefore I defie you, and in sadnes, I hold such holines a kind of madnes; And so, sir Iohn, we two will make an end, And each of us about his Busines wend. Yet e're we part I would fall to againe, And of the Latin speake a word or twaine, There was but one tongue at the Birth of Abel, And many at the building up of Babel, A wicked work, which God would have confounded, But when Christ came, all tongues again resounded, To build his Church, by his Apostles teaching; Which was in praying sure as well as preaching; For prayer is the full and true perfection Of holy service (saving your correction) Then if our Lord to mine owne tongue be readie, What need I then with Latin move our Ladie, Or if to both my prayers must be in, I pray sir tell wth which should I begin, And to pray jointly to them both as one, Your Latin prayers then are quickly gone? For Pater noster never will accord With her, nor Ave Mary with our Lord. If I have him, what need I seek another, Or will he nothing doe without his Mother, And this (sir Priest) was much in Question, Disputed long, with deep disgestion, Whether the Ave Mary should be said To God, or to our Lady when they pray'd, With which Saint Andrewes University, Was puzled with a strange diversity, And sate so long they cooled all their Kale, At last the Master Cooke heard of the tale, And like a mad man ran among the Clergy, Crying with many a Domine me asperge, To give the Pater noster to the Father, And Avies to our Lady altogether, And every man may thinke (that wise or grave is) She's more then satisfied with Creeds and Aves. At which the Clergie (fearing more confusion) Were all contented with the Cookes conclusion. Priest. Pedlar, this tale, is of thee coyned new; Ped. Sir Iohn Ile leese my packe if't be not true: Againe, all learned Monkes and Fryers have read, How Christ himselfe taught us of his owne head, That every soule that is with sinne opprest, Should come to him, and he would give them rest: Come all to me (said he) not to another, Come all to me (said he) not to my Mother. And If I doe as our good Lord commanded, I know our Lady will no wayes withstand it. And so if I should say my prayers in Lattin, Unto the Lord at Even-song or at Matin, And never understand what I were saying, Thinke you the Lord would take it for true praying, No sure, he will not, for I truly know, My tongue and heart must both together goe, And hereupon I'le tell you what befell, To learned Clearkes, that Latin well could spell, With whom by chance I lodged at an Inne, Whereas an old wife on her wheele did spin, And towards evening she fell to and pray'd, But neither they or I knew what she said, One said she canted, others said she mumbled, And still strange language from her lips she fumbled, Round run her wheele, and round her tongue did run, She mumbled and she slaver'd, and she spun; What think you now sir Iohn of this old Hussie, Where was her heart when as she was so busie. At last (said one) Dame wot you what you say, No, not (quoth she) but well I wot I pray; You pray (quoth he) and know not what I grant, Alas how can you be so ignorant. The woman, musing little at the motion, Said, ignorance is Mother of Devotion. If Ignorance be mother then (said he) Sure darknesse must her onely daughter be; Pray'd you, (quoth I) when al the time you span, What matters that, quoth she God's a good man, And knowes what I speak in the Latin tongue, Either at Matins or at Even-song. Alas, good sir, was not this wife abus'd, Whose soule and sences all were so confus'd, You know these unknown tongues can profit no man, And one tongue is enough for any woman; But when we pray in true sinceritie, As God commands in spirit and veritie, The heart sends up the tongue as Messenger Unto the Lord, a pleasant passenger. Priest. But Pedlar, here's a prettie little Booke, Wherein if thou wilt spare the time to looke, Set forth by a good Catholicke Divine, Which out of doubt will settle thy ingine With it, thy conscience will be better fram'd, The Gag of the new Gospel it is nam'd: He clearely proves by Zacharies example, When he did sacrifice vvithin the Temple, And all the people prayd and stood vvithout, They knevv not then what tongue he spake no doubt; Ergo the Masse may be both said and sung, In other language then our mother Tongue. Ped. Sir Iohn I see your holy Catholicke, Upon the Text hath put a pretty tricke, Did Zachary speake in a Latin stile, When all the people staid without the while, He was a Jew sure, and knew Hebrew well, And spake no Latin for ought you can tell; For if the people heard not what he said, Could they or you know in what tongue he pray'd Since understanding commeth by the eare, He cannot understand that doth not heare. Prove it that Zachary spake Latin, then I'le say all Monkes and Fryers are honest men. Because a learned Priest may pray in Latin, And mumble o're his Even-song, Masse, and Matin, Ergo a Pedlar to the Lord may pray, And know no sillable that he doth say, So when you put me to your Pater noster, I aske an Egge when I would have an Oister. And seeing thus our Faiths doe disagree, That neither I with you, nor you with mee Can be united, with one minde and heart, I thinke it best we take our leaves and part. I'le pray that God, in Grace and mercy, would Bring all his straying Flock into his Fold. FINIS. A full and compleat Answer against the Writer of a late Volume set forth, entituled A Tale in a Tub, or A Tub Lecture: with a Vindication of that ridiculous name called Round-Heads. The verse has been extracted from prose text. First, The Complaint of the abused most ridiculous Round-heads. Come, brethren, let's deplore our wofull state, Since all we have done is almost undone: Our paines and charges both betimes and late Is like the battry of an Elder Gun; We back againe unto our trade must fall, Nor shall we be allow'd to preach at all. And we from Sylla to Charybdis cast, And from Charybdis back to Sylla hurld, From wrong to injurie, from griefe that's past To woe that's present, we rub through the world, 'Twixt Hawke and Buzzard, we seeme Planet-struck, 'Midst Chance and Fate, bad Fortune and ill Luck. 'Tis manifest that we have done our best, To bring all wit and learning in disgrace; The Church and Church-men we do still molest, In hope we each might have a Preachers place: Our zeale hath still the House of Prayer deni'd, And many a Barne and Stable sanctifi'd. What have we not done? we have rav'd and rail'd, Vnrail'd, revil'd, exclaim'd, and made a noyse, Brake windowes downe, left nothing unassail'd, And wanting men (to clamour) borrowed boyes: We have most stoutly play'd the beasts like men, In hope to be all benefic'd, (But when?) 'Tis said, that they which China dishes make, Doe burie them in the earth an hundred yeares: Their Makers being dead, their Heires doe take Those dishes from the earth, and all our feares Is, that doe what we can with works and wishes, Our labours will be like to China dishes. For now againe the wicked 'gin to rise, And call us Round-heads, and such scurvie names, And do our pure profession scandalize With Libels, Pamphlets, and most true exclaimes: So that we gape like pining Tantalus, For all we have done is worth scant a Lowse. Verses upon the defacing of Cheapeside Crosse, with the Pictures of Christ and Saint Peter. How? steale the leade from Cheapeside-crosse (O base) I'le take my oath on't 'tis a heavy case: Some say the Devill did it, and I graunt The Devill is a mighty Puritant. He never could endure the Crosse, because, Man (on the Crosse) was ransomd from his claws; But whosoe're 'twas, Brownist, Punk or Pimp: If not the Devill, 'twas the Devils Impe, What e're he may pretend, he is a Grosse Dam'd Iew, that tortures Christ upon the Crosse. I wonder why the watchmen did not scare Vm, Sure 'twas some sleeping watch that lackt a larum And so St. Peter (whom our Saviour chose) One of his twelve Apostles, had his Nose, And both his Armes knockt of, where was the Cock That did not wake S. Peter at that knock? Christ made him an Apostle, now who can Without his Arms make him a Gentleman? Some Crop-eare did it in revenge I feare, Because St. Peter cut off Malchus eare. What did the babe, what did our Lady do? Poore Innocents alas, they suffered too. This shews the Devils brood, like th'Irish wild, Will spare no man or woman, maid or child: Now my opinion of the crosse is this, It is amisse to such as make't amisse. To such as reverence it, or adore it, Or say their prayers to it, or before it. Such do pervert it from its proper use, And turn an Ornament to an abuse. Turks, Infidels, Moores, Pagans, Heathen, Iewes, They know not Christ, therefore no Crosses use. And no true Christian justly can repine, To let a Crosse stand as a Christian signe. Knaves may deface it, fooles may worship it, All which may be for want of grace or wit, To those that wrongd the Crosse this is my curse, They never may have crosses in their purse. FINIS. A Plea for PREROGATIVE: OR, Give Cæsar his due. Being the Wheele of Fortune turn'd round: Or, The World turned topsie-turvie. Malice, Disloyalty, War and Sects aspire, Religion, Peace, Obedience are ith mire. Religion, Peace, Obedience, Love, no doubt, Though they be loe, the Wheele will turne about. A Plea for Prerogative: OR, Give Cæsar his due. The Divel's horne-mad, Religion here should florish, Or England constantly the Truth should nourish: And He (contriving with the Romish Sect) They soon a hellish stratagem project, That with a strange blast of a Powder-blow, Into the Ayre the Parliament to throw, And with a whirle-winde terrour to appall Gods Word profest, the Court, the State and all Records, Lawes, Statutes, Grants, Decrees and Charters, Men, women, children (piece-meale torne in quarters;) Magnifique Buildings, pompous Monuments; Illustrious guildings, sumptuous ornaments; King, Prince, Peeres, Commons, with one puffe should caper, And (in a moment) turn'd to ayre and vapour. The Divell and Rome are all starke mad at this, That they, their great desired aime should misse, Devis'd more mischiefes from th'infernall pit, To make us this deliverance to forget, And be ingratefull to that power above, Who this great danger from us did remove; For Sathan knowes, that base ingratitude Doth all, and every damned vice include; And therefore 'tis the totall of transgressions To be unthankfull for Gods gracious blessings: There's nothing else drawes down th'Almighties hate, It hath dismembred wretched Englands state; Pride, avarice, lust, hath broke our happy peace, And daily do our sins, and shames increase. He's a wise man (that without danger) can Serve God his King, and be an honest man; For (in these dayes) to speak truth and do right, Is paid with scandall, danger and despight. Thus vice is entred, vertue is thrust out, And Fortunes Wheele is madly turn'd about; Peace, Love, Religion and Obedience Are vertues of exceeding excellence; Yet as the Picture in the Wheele doth show, They are turn'd downwards in the spokes below, Whilst Malice, War, Sects and Disloyalty Are in the upper spokes, exalted high, And true Obedience neuer did refuse, To give to God and Cæsar both their dues; Though she be humble, free from arrogance, Yet her humility doth her advance: And though she be trod downe, I make no doubt But Fortunes Wheel will shortly turn about: Disloyalty doth proudly over-top her, And makes a glistring guilded shew of copper, Full of corruption, basenesse and deceit, Deluding and most feigned counterfeit. Some do complain of Fortune and blinde chance, And do their hands and eyes t'wards heaven advance; And cry, O God (which madst the glorious Sun,) What hath poore England 'gainst Religion done, That all her goodnesse topsie turvie lyes Derided, jeer'd at, wrong'd by contraries? Religion was the sacred bond and tye, The rule and square how men should live and dye; The ground and sole foundation of the Law; The good mans sword and shield, the bad mans awe; Twas one entire in Majesty high stated, Now broken, fractur'd, rent and dislocated; Divided into Sects, in pieces shatter'd; And (like a Beggers cloake) all patch'd and totterd. And what hath England done to worke all this? Nothing at all, but doing all amisse; Esteeming earths corrupted fading drosse, And slighting heaven, and true Religions losse. These are the causes, these for vengeance cals; This makes high climers to have loest fals, When men seeke Honour with ambicious guile, My little wit doth at their follies smile; That though they seeme most glorious, great and stout, Yet Fortunes Wheele will quickly turne about. The potent Pope and Conclave of that Sect, Did (and do) daily stratagems project. The mungrill Papist, the Arminian, The consubstanciall misled Lutheran; The Anabaptists, Brownists, Arians, Scismaticall Disciplinarians. These, and more Sects of Seperatists beside, Do from Religion to opinion slide; And as they from each other disagree, In various fashions God is serv'd we see. Th'eternall Word's high Majesty is such (That man can never honour it too much,) Is turnd unto the lowest spoke o'th Wheele, And too too few the overthrow doth feele. The King, who is the Lords anointed knowne, Whose Crownes and Kingdomes (under God's) his owne; I will not say't t'oppresse, but true and just To guide all under his great charge and trust; Though he (next Christ) imediate power hath; And his resisters merit heav'ns hot wrath: Yet this is not remembred, very few Will render Cæsar what is Cæsars due; Which is obedience, loyalty and love (Because his power is from the power above;) But Church and State, are by the rabble rout Abus'd; thus Fortunes wheele is turn'd about. Religion (true) that ought to be the tye From God to man, that man should rule thereby, Is made a stable, a very staulking-horse, Wherein each beast doth run a beastly course. Religion now each ignoramus whirles Into the fancies of fooles, boyes and girles, Who dare talke of Misterious Canticicles (Better then Bishops can) in their Conventickles. They can finde out Daniels prophetique meaning, And from the Bible they have so much gleaning, That they dare venture with their quirks and quips To expound Saint John and his Apocalips. Thus they thinke we, and we thinke they are out, But Fortunes wheele I hope will turne about. Sects up are mounted, and their impudence And ignorance hath drove Religion hence; As once the Papists, in Queene Maries raigne, The Protestant profession did disdaine; When swords and halters, and tormenting flames, Exiles, imprisonments, and all th'extreames That hell or Roman mischiefe could devise, The Gospell to suppresse by tyrannize; And now the Almighty hath this Kingdome grac'd, That Popish superstition is defac'd: A crew of new Sects are sprung up of late, As bad as Papists were to Church and State; Whose barren knowledge seemes all things to know, Who would all rule, and learning overthrow; Whose wisdomes still are in the wane, most dull; Whose ignorance is alwayes at the full; Whose good workes are invisible, so good Not to be seene, felt, heard, or understood: Of these mad Sects, ther's too too many a wigeon, That doth despise the Protestant Religion; And worse then Papists they deride and flout, But Fortunes wheele, I guesse, will turne about. Peace (the same day that Christ rose from the grave) Was the first gift He his Disciples gave; And that his Peace should still with them remain Ioh. 20. 19 26. He (eight dayes after, gave them Peace again; That Peace which passeth understanding all, Phil. 4. 7. Is racketed and bandied like a ball: Warre, strife, contention, mischiefe and debate Opposeth Peace, and seekes to ruinate Faire England, by the meanes of men accurst, Who wrong her most whom she hath bred and nurst. And now against her Peace th'have madly fought, But Fortunes wheele I know will turn about. Love is the Livery, cognizance, and Crest Christ gives his servants, who are ever blest; Joh. 13. 35 Th'immortall God, left glorious heaven above, And was made mortall (O transcendent Love!) Nay more, he for his enemies did dye, And rise, that they might live eternally. He cald them brethren (so their loves to win) Heb. 2. 12. And made himselfe like them, in all but sin. He cals each true beleeving soule his brother; And lov'd us so, cause we should love each other: But all this love which he bestow'd so free, Is back repaid with Malice, as we see: The Wheele doth shew us how the case doth stand, Malice and hatred hath the upper hand; Our words and works do shew we love him not; Our love to one another is forgot; We say and do the most part to this end (He that so lov'd us) how we may offend; And stead of loving one another, as Our blessed Saviours last Commandment was, With malice we would cut each others throats; Which shewes we do not wear Christs livery coats: And as Himselfe hath long agoe foretold, Th'increase of sin makes many mens love cold. Thus man his malice against man doth spout, God grant the Wheele may quickly turne about. Nor shall my Muse in this taske further run; I wish the King and Parliament had done; That as his Majesty is knowne to be Gods chiefe vicegerent in his soveraignty; So He with them may All as one combine To settle things, both Humaine and Divine; That we may be held free from all offence, And gaine him hither, and not drive him hence With Libels, tumults, and a wretched rout, For which I'le hope the Wheele will turn about. FJNJS. MAD FASHIONs, OD FASHIONS, All out of Fashions, OR, The Emblems of these Distracted times. Mad fashions, od fashions, all out of fashions, OR, The Emblems of these distracted times. The Picture that is Printed in the front Is like this Kingdome, if you look upon't: For if you well doe note it as it is, It is a Transform'd Metamorphasis. This Monstrous Picture plainely doth declare This land (quite out of order) out of square. His Breeches on his shoulders doe appeare, His doublet on his lower parts doth weare; His Boots and Spurs upon his Armes and Hands, His Gloves upon his feet (whereon he stands) The Church or'eturnd (a lamentable show) The Candlestick above, the light below, The Cony hunts the Dogge, the Rat the Cat, The Horse doth whip the Cart (I pray marke that) The Wheelbarrow doth drive the man (oh Base) And Eeles and Gudgeons flie a mighty pace. And sure this is a Monster of strange fashion, That doth surpasse all Ovids Transformation. And this is Englands case this very day, All things are turn'd the Cleane contrary way; For Now, when as a Royall Parliament, (With King, and Peers, and Commons whole consent) Have almost sate two yeeres, with paines and Cares, And Charge, to free us from our Griefes and feares, For when many a worthy Lord and Knight, And good Esquire (for King and Countreys Right) Have spent so much time with Great Toyle, and Heede, All Englands Vicious garden how to weed, So like a Wildernesse 'twas overrun, That though much hath been done; All is not done. The Devill doth perswade, entice and lurke, And force bad men to set good men aworke. That whilst the Worthies strive to right our wrongs, And give to each man, what to him belongs; Whil'st they take paines to settle all things heere, An Irish Devill, doth madly domineere. From Hells black Pit, begirt with Romish Armes, Thousands of Locusts are in Troopes and Swarmes, More Barbarous then the Heathen, worse then Iewes, No Turkes or Tartars would such Tortures use. Sure that Religion can no wayes be good, That so inhumanly delights in Blood: Nor doth that doctrine from the Scriptures spring, That Subiects should Rebell against their King. Nay (further) murder, ravish, spoile, deflowre, Burne and lay waste, depopulate, devoure, Not sparing Infants at the Breast or wombe, (To die where first they liu'd, their Birth, their Tombe) 'Tis said no Serpent, Adder, Snake, or Toade, Can live in Ireland, or hath there aboade: 'Tis strange that shee those Vipers doth not Kill, That Gnawes her Bowells, and her blood doth spill, Can Irish Earth Kill all things vennemous, And can shee nurse such Vermin Mischievous: Her owne sonnes Native, worse then Strangers Borne, They have their Mothers Entrailes rent and torne, Yet still her Indulgencie, harbours those, And feeeds those Rebells that doe breed her woes: God (in thy Mercy) give her strength and Ayde, And courage, make her foes and ours dismay'd, Thou Lord of Hosts, thine owne cause take in hand, Thy foes (Thine Antichristian foes) withstand; Defend thy truth, and all our Armies guide, Our enemies to scatter and devide. Thus leaving Ireland (with my hearty prayers) To Brittaine back againe my Muse repaires: Where I perceive a Metamorphosis, Is most preposterous, as the Picture is, The world's turn'd upside downe, from bad to worse, Quite out of frame, The cart before the Horse. The Felt-maker, and sawcie stable Groome Will dare to Pearch into the Preachers Roome, Each Ignorant, doe of the Spirit Boast, And prating fooles brag of the holy-Ghost, When Ignoramus will his Teacher Teach, And Sow-gelders, and Coblers dare to preach, This shewes, mens witts are monstrously disguis'd, Or that our Countrey is Antipodis'd. When holy Common Prayer, is by the Rable Accounted Porridge, and unfruitfull Babble, When our Beliefe is not so much as sed, When as the Ten Commandments are not read, When as the Lords Prayer is almost neglected, When as all decencie is quite reiected, When to avoid a Romish Papists name, A man must be unmannerly, past shame, When he that doth shew Reverence, doth offend, And he seems best that will not bow or bend, When he that into Gods House doth not come, As to a Stable, or a Tipling Roome, Is counted for a Popish favorite, And branded so, despis'd, and scorn'd with spite. When He that (of his wayes) doth conscience make, And in his heart doth world, flesh, feind forsake, Loves God with all his soule; adores no pelfe, And loves his Neighbour, as hee loves himselfe, This man is Rare to finde, yet this Rare man Shall have the Hatefull name of Puritan; When execrations pierce the firmament, And oathes doe batter 'gainst Heavens Battlement: When Imprecations, and damb'd Blasphemies, In sundry cursed volleys scale the Skies, When men more Bruitish then the Horse or Mule, Who know not to obey, presume to Rule, Thus Church and Common-wealth, and men, all are (Much like the Picture) out of frame or square. And if'twere possible our fathers old Should live againe, and tread upon this mould, And see all things confused, overthrowne, They would not know this Countrey for their owne. For England hath no likelyhood, or show Of what it was but seventy yeeres agoe; Religion, manners, life and shapes of men, Are much unlike the people that were then, Nay Englands face and language is estrang'd, That all is Metamorphis'd, chop'd and chang'd, For like as on the Poles, the VVorld is whorl'd So is this Land the Bedlam of the VVorld; That I amazed, and amated am, To see Great Brittaine turn'd to Amsterdam, Mens braines and witts (two simples beat together) From thence (mix'd and compounded) are sent hither. For Amsterstam is landed (as I heare) At Rye, or Hastings, or at Dover Peere, At Harwich, Ipswich, Sandwich, or at Weymouth, At Portsmouth, Dartmouth, Exmouth, Plimouth, Farmouth, At Yarmouth, and at all the Ports to Tinmouth, And westward unto Bristow and to Monmouth; From all these Mouthes and more, mad sects are sent, VVho have Religion all in pieces Rent, One would have this, Another would have that, And most of them would have they know not what. God give us peace, and ease us of our paine, And send those sects, from whence they came againe, The Papist, and the Schismatique; both grieves The Church, for shee's like Christ (Between two Thieves.) I took the Protestation twice of Late, VVhere I protested not to Innovate. 'Tavoide all Popish Rites, and to expresse Obedience to what Englands Church professe, My Loyalty unto my King is bent VVith duty to the Peers and Parliament. VVith Prayers, and my best service for them all, That on them may Heavens chiefest blessings fall, That with one heart, as one man, with one minde, (For Gods great glory) they may be combinde, And never vary, but goe boldly on, To end the good worke, which they have begun. This is the Sum (which ne'er shall be forsooke) Of what I in the Protestation tooke. But, for all this, I may be mannerly In Gods House, and be free from Papistrie; I hope I may put off my hat, and be Allow'd to Kneel, and Pray, and Bow my Knee, VVhen as divine Command bids, onely then I'le Bow to God, and not to Saints, or Men. And from those dueties I will never vary Till death, or Order doe command contrary. Th'Almighties Name be ever prays'd and blest, That Romish superstition is supprest, VVee have no Abbyes, Abbots, Friars, or Monks, Nor have we Nuns, or Stewes allow'd for Punks, VVee have no Masses, or no Mass-Priests heere, But some are hang'd, and some are fled for feare. All those that are so bold to stay behind, I wish they may like entertainment finde; Beades, Bables, Relliques, Tapers, Lamps or Lights, Wee have no superstitious Romish Rites, Wee seek our Pardons from our Heavenly Hope, And not by works, or favour from the Pope; To Saints we make no prayer, or Intercession, And unto God alone wee make Confession; Wee hold no Reall Presence in the Bread, And wee doe know King Charles our supreame head (Beneath God, who hath plac'd him in his Throne) For other Supreame, wee acknowledge none. No Purgatory, Image, Wood or Stone, No Stock, or carved Block, wee trust upon, Nor is our Church discretion heere so little, As to Baptize with Cream, with salt and Spittle. VVee have as many Sacraments, as Heaven Ordain'd; which are but two, and Rome hath seven. VVee doe not Christen Bells, and give them Names Of Simon, Peter, Andrew, Iohn and Iames; VVee use no Pilgrimage, or Holy-water, Nor in an unknowne tongue our Prayers scatter; All these, and many more, in Rome are us'd VVhich are by us reiected and refus'd. And yet too many faults, alas remaines, VVhich are the Churches, and the Kingdomes staines, The Church Triumphant is not cleere from spots, The Poore Church Millitant hath still some blots, Heer's all unperfect, somthing's still amisse, And nothing's blest, but in Eternall Blisse. Meane time, till wee amend, and leave our crimes, The Picture is the Emblem of the Times. FINIS. AQUA-MUSÆ: OR, Cacafogo, Cacadæmon, CAPTAIN GEORGE WITHER Wrung in the Withers. Deus dabit his quoque Funem. Ha, let me see, is that that Traiterous Thing, Whose Campo-Musæ hath Revil'd the King: Sure 'tis not he; yet like him much he looks That late compos'd such sinne Confounding Books, In sharp Ramnusiaes Pisse, his Pen he dip'd And Brittaines Great Abuses Whipt and Strip'd, And in his Motto did with Braggs declare That in himselfe all Vertues perfect were. Art thou that wonder of the Vniverse Whose lines Heav'n, Hell, and Through the World did Pierce, In Sixteen hundred twenty six, that yeare Thou Wrot'st a Book (Brittains Remembrancer) And in that Book with Boasting Boldnesse, then Thou Vaunt'st thy selfe a Miracle of Men, For never Hippocrite did shew more skill And Pend so Well, and yet intend so ill. In thy third Page, thou in that Preface say'st, That thou his Majesties High favour Weighst And that thou holdst His Grace more deere to thee And Precious, then thy very soule could be. Thy fourth Page Saies, thy Muse Spewes not Base Rimes 'Gainst Publique Persons (but to Lash the Times) Thou applie'st King Davids Nine and Thirtieth Psalme His Stormes of Griefes, his hidden fire, his Calme, All which Blasphemously thy selfe Appliest Vnto thy selfe; And in Applying Lyest. Thy ninth Page saies, bad Tongues will set their stings Unjustly, on the Sacred names of Kings. Thy tenth Page truely doth the Truth Repeat, That the King sits in God Almighties Seat. And thus (with Pharisaicall Ostentation) Thou saist Commission, (Calling, Revelation,) Were given thee from above, Reader, pray Note, How this Imposture late hath turn'd his Coate; View but his Campo Musæ, and Confer The words and Sense, with his Remembrancer, And wavering Lies and Lines (Black upon White) Shewes rayling Hypocrite, Hermophrodite, Nor Male or Female, neither both or neither Much more Incongruent then flint and feather. Is this the Vulgar Vassalls, Valiant George Whose Whileom Muse did oracles disgorge, Who was admir'd of every Man and Woeman Of all sorts, from the Tinker to the Broomeman, Sure this cannot be he, And yet 'tis he, Then how (the Devill) can he thus changed be, Can he, that so much honesty profest (As if all honesty had been in's Brest) Can he be Metamorphos'd to a Knave, And write and fight, his Soveraigne to out-brave, Can his Lines Lye (that sweet Peace did desire) Yet stirs up Warres, to set the Realme on fire, All this is possible, all this is done, This is George Wyther, his owne Mothers Son. Now he's great George a Horse-back, (mounted high) Dares to affront, and Raile 'gainst Majesty, This is the George thus alterd, thus all-turd Whose Satyres Goose-quill is transform'd t'a sword, For whose sake, I protest it with my Pen, I never will trust Wall-eyd Jade agen. Brave George, no George of Cappodocia, But famous George of Braggodocia, Ride on fierce George, untill thy high desert By Transmutation, make thy Horse a Cart. What contraries doth thy mad Braines possesse That with a Traiterous Warre doth Peace professe, That playes at fast, and loose, with handy dandy Mak'st Subjects 'gainst their Soveraigne Bullets bandy, Much mischiefe in that double mind did lurke, And Hell it selfe, set that dam'd Muse a worke. Was ever such vile fragment Riming Raggs Patch'd up together with abusive Braggs; That who so doth his Campo-Musæ Read, Will judge the Devill did his Invention Lead; Like to a Iesuited subtill Fox, His Honest Writings but a Paradox: His Verities are false, his Errors true, Such Riffe Raffe hotch Potch, his sweet Muse doth Brew. How villany doth cunningly deceive, And good and bad together interweave; He Praies, Inveighs, Commends, Contemns, Extols, Approves, Reproves, Loves, Scornes, Obeys, Controls, Admits, Commits, Omits, Permits, submits, Remits, and Limmits, as his humor fits, Tossing his Soveraignes Honour to and fro, Even as his sawcy Idle Braines do Crow, And with his Rimes doth Knaves and Fooles inspire To blow the Bellowes of Rebellious fire. Hell never Spewd worse villaines then are those That weekly (weakly) Raile in Rime and Prose, 'Mongst which accursed Crew, a part thou Bearst, And in the Divells great name Rebellion Rearst. For had not that black Breed of Cerberus, Scout, Dove, Diurnall, and Britannicus, Wise Wither, Booker, and the damned swarmes Of Rake-hells, Animated Englands harmes, All our Contentions had been reconcil'd Long since, and blessed Peace had gently smil'd. Wer't not for theirs and thine ill working Braine, The King had Iustly had His own againe: Th'affrighting front of bloody Warre had not Disturb'd no honest English man or Scot. Thousands of Soules are from their Bodies parted, (By Lyes and Cursed Libellers perverted) Which may be fear'd did to perdition fall Before their Bodies could have Buriall. You Mungrell Whelps of Hells Infernall Litter, What is the cause that makes your hate so bitter, Is it because you thinke your selves more Righteous, Or (in the Devills name) wherefore thus despight ye us? Is it because the King's a Protestant, That 'gainst him you are joyn'd in Covenant? Is it because he meanes to be so still And never meanes to change, you wish him ill? Is it because hee's Mercifull and Iust You those Indignities upon him thrust, Is it because he ne're intended wrong That you doe hold his Life and Raigne too long? Are these the Causes wherefore you dislike him Are these th'occasions why your Malice strike him? Goe hang your selves base Villaines, he shall Live And flourish, and his God will Guerdon give To you with Judas, and Achitophell Where unrepenting Cursed Rebells dwell. What Armes into the Field can Traitors bring But Arm'd Impiety against the King; Is not the Person of the King so high As God Almighties sacred Deputie? Then what are those blasphemous Rabshakaes Anathema's, and Maranathema'es? Psal. 14. v. 4, 5, 6, 7, God lookes and sees how they doe plot and plod They understand not, nor seeke after God, Abhominable out ot'h way they'r gone Ther's none doth good amongst them, no not one, Their Throats are open Sepulchers, their Tongues Have ly'de deceitfully with slandring Wrongs, And underneath their Lips Aspes poyson is, Their Mouthes are full of Cursing bitternes, Their Feet are very swift mens blood to shed Haples destruction in the wayes they tread, The way of Peace they have not knowne, and there Before their eyes of God there is no feare. Thus is the foureteenth Psalme in Davids stile Apply'd to such as dare the King Revile. And what art thou then, but a false pretender That seekes to Ruinate the Faiths Defender: To blow Warres Trumpet, without warrant for it, Is foule Rebellion, all good men abhorre it. And what hath Roguish Riming, Tricks and Ieeres But set us all together by the Eares, To Murder, Pilfer, Plunder, and oppresse, To make Wives Widdowes, Children fatherlesse, The Father 'gainst the Son, Son 'gainst the Father, And Brother against Brother force together, Whil'st Christian Faith, you Hipocrites or'ewhelme, And Publique Faith hath Cheated all the Realme. This (Master George) is your great Trades A great ship that used to go to the East Indies, called the Trade's Encrease. Encrease To Write, Raile, and disturbe your Countryes Peace, In Rime to render our Dread Soveraigne odious, For your great profit hath been much commodious, Had'st thou not Writ, and Raild as thou hast done Th'adst been no Captaine, Th'adst bin hangd as soone; The onely way to flourish, and goe brave, Is to turne Rebell, Hipocrite and Knave, If I my selfe, would but a Villaine be I should be Mounted and prefer'd like thee. Yet 'tis not feare of Heavens Eternall wrath Or Hells dam'd Tortures, me restrained hath, But filiall feare of God, in me beares sway, That I in love his Ordinance obay, And those that doe not (I doe feare) their fate Will be the portion of the Reprobate. But whither Wither, doth my fancy flee? I ought not write in serious phrase to thee, Thou precious most pernicious Prelate hater To Durhams Reverend Bishop thou wast Cater, Or Steward, where to make thy 'Compts seem cleare, Thou made'st two Monthes of July in one yeare, And in the totall Reck'ning it was found D? Howsen. Thou Cheat'st the Bishop of five hundred pound. But thou didst hold it for no sinne at all, To Rob the Person that's Episcopall. This is no Crime in thee or thy Compeeres, Tub-Preaching Tinkers, Pedlars, Pulpitteeres, Whose best Religion, is most irreligious, Who think Church Spoylers are not sacrilegious, Who hold the Clergy as superfluous People, And make the Chancell baser then the Steeple. These are as arrant Rogues as ever twangd And I doe wish them in the Bell-ropes hangd. But leaving unto God, the wronged Clergie Now, with a fresh Charge, Wither I must charge ye, And in a true way, I will make Relation, That thy best Writings are Equivocation. And that thy mind and Muse, were never friends In any goodnesse, but for private ends. But leaving that a while, I will discourse And once i'le put the Cart before the Horse; His Picture graven before some of his Books, the Commendatory Verses to the Picture, were written by himselfe.Thy Picture to thy Bookes was Printed, put With curious Workmanship engrav'd and cut: And Verses under it, were wisely pend Which fooles suppos'd were written by some friend, Which God knowes, thou, I, and a Thousand know, Those lines (thy selfe praise) from thy selfe did flow, Thou dotedst so upon thine owne Effigies, It look'd so smugge, Religious, Irreligious, So Amiable Lovely, Sweet and Fine, A Phisnomie Poetique and Divine: 'Till (like Narcissus) gazing in that Brook, Pride drown'd thee, in thy selfe admiring Book. Yet for your Valour, you deserv'd much fame You Conquer'd Farnham Castle, and did tame And vanquisht all the Cavaliers so Bravely, (Look in a Glasse, and you shall see the Knave Lye) A Dogge, two Cats, and an old Woeman were Your opposites, when as you entred there, For which great service, had your Masters might, And power withall; you had bin dubd a Knight. But 'tis no matter, they might doe as well, They may Create you halfe a Colonell. In Farnham Castle, thou wast great Commander, And Thoughtst thy selfe more great then Alexander, Yet in thy Carriage, Valour, Fashion, Forme, Thou wast a Strong, Infirme, Stout, Feeble Worme. For when thy Master Rebels call'd thee out, With all thy fellowes of that damned Rout, Thy Cowardise, thou finely did'st disguise, Thy sight was dim, the blame was in thine Eyes. For want of sight, thou durst not see to Fight, But like a Rebell Divell couldst see to Write. 'Tis well thou wast not Valiant, as thy Pen Emblazons thee, th'hadst then bin Man of Men, Great Agamemnon to thee were a Toy, And Brave Achilles but a prating Boy, Ulysses a poor Silly Stoick Asse, And Hector for a Foole in Armes should passe. Oh had'st thou had the profit of thine Eyne, Th'adst beaten purblind all the Worthies 9. Thus blind with Ignorance, and Impudence, And Wall-ey'de in thy seared Conscience, Thy Goose-quill, hath Revil'd the King and Law, When as thy Sword thou never dar'st to draw, For which from both sides thou deserv'st a Fee, A Triple Twist at the Triangle Tree. And now I'le leave to fish in troubled Waters, Let's talke a little of some other Matters; 'Tis knowne that once within these thirty yeares, Thou wast in Jayle for scandalling some Peeres, And 'tis not lawfull for a Satyres Pen, To wrong the Honours of particular Men, Which you did, not for any hate you bore To Vice or Villany, but that therefore You would be famous, and to Prizen Committed, Whereby you seem'd most wonderfully Witted. There, in the Marshalseas, whole flights of Gulls, Of Schismatiques, of Cuckolds, Knaves and Trulls, In Droves and Heardes, in Pilgrimage they came (As Er'st Fooles did t'our Lady of Walsingham) You were their Idoll Saint, and at your Shrine They offred Hecatombes of Coyne and Wine, Sweet meates and Iunkets, (more then you could dreame) Came flowing to you dayly like a streame. Thus to your Mill came tagge, ragge, great and small, You Ground, and (with the Cogges) took toll of all. At last to give some Ease unto your Mill You were Releast from Priz'n against your will. Then was your Pockets Treasure full to'th top, Which (by degrees) might t'a Consumption drop, Then after that (by chance) met you and I Where we us'de Complementall courtesy, And talkd of Poetry, and then I sayd You (by the Muses favour) was well payd, Whilst I (for my part) whatsoe're I writ Though men approved and applauded it, Yet fortune unto me, was still unkind Bounty was fast asleep, or hard to find, Verbositie and Vapour was my Gaines And Poverty the Portion of my Paines, Though you found many an Ignorant Mecenas, Which made you fat, still remain'd a Leane Asse, Words like to those, or much to this effect I spake, and you this Answer did direct. John, you must boldly doe, as I have don Against great Persons let your Verses run, Snarle at the State, and let your Satyre's pen Write against Government, and Noblemen. You must run wilfully into offence, What though they call it sawcy Impudence, And so Commit you for't, as they did me Then shall you Thrive, and be as you would be; Your Books would sell your selfe get Coyn and Fame, And then (like mine) Renown'd shall be your Name. I doe not say our talke was punctuall such, But what we spake imported full as much. By which may be perceiv'd thou Wrot'st so odly Not out of Hatred unto Acts ungodly, By insinuation to intrude Into th'affections of the Multitude. Thus from poor witlesse Lumps of Ignorance Thou gatt'st Applause, Coyne, Cloaths, and Countenance. As to their Cost, the most of them can prove Thou Cheat'st 'em of their Money and their love, And now your Campo-Musæ hath found Grace To grace you in a gracelesse Captains Place. Now dreadfull Warres, and Politique designes Are the Effects of thy Prophetique Lines: Armes, mighty Armes, and strange Redoubted deeds Are th'Issues now that ftom thy Muse proceeds, Th'ast turnd thy Anagrams to Ambuscadoes Thy Diagrams to terrible Bravadoes, Thy Chronograms to horrible Stockadoes, Thy Epigrams to desp'rate Imbrocadoes, Thy Disticks to Redoubts and Barricadoes, Thy Dactills and thy Spondees to Scalladoes, Thy measur'd verse to Marches and Soldadoes, Thy Cantoes, and Acrosticks to Granadoes, Thy Canzoes to Brigades, and Canvasadoes, Thy Dialogues to Bruising Bastinadoes, Thy Prologues to most Barbarous Stab-adoes, Thy Catalogues to Vagrant Renegadoes, Thy Epilogues to Warlike Pallizadoes, And Warwick playes th'usurping Adelantado, For Englands ruine rules the Kings Armado, But 'tis my hope your ends will prove Mockado, Not worth a ragge of rotten welch Freezado, And thou esteemed lesse then a Lantzprezado. For if thou durst lay by thy cursed Spleen, And speak but Loyally of King and Queen, Cease to bely the Lords, and but deny Thou never slandred'st them with Papistry; Cease to Abuse the Bishops, and the Tribe Of sacred Levi, cease thou cursed Scribe, T'applaud foule Treason, and approve all those, That to Gods Church the King, and Peace are foes: Seek but thy Countreys Peace in word and deed, Thy Maisters then will hang thee for thy Meede, Be but an Honest man two daies together, No more a Captain then, but Poor George Wither. Should I but answer every Lye and Line, In that Base Balderdash poor Thing of thine, I might b'accounted so, so, Thus and Thus, An Asse impertinent, Voluminus, A Murderer of Paper, a time Waster, A Folio Foole, a Zany Poetaster, Thy Apish Coxcombe (in thy imitation, Like thee) the Squirt-Rime of our Troubled Nation, One of the Sages of Old Gothams Clarkes That makes reply to every dog that Barkes. E're I'le so be thy means for Maintenance, Let thy Applauders dye in Ignorance, For 'tis most probable thy jeeres and Lying, Thou wrot'st in hope of Gaine by my Replying. And if men truly would thy Book examine, There may they find both Sense and Reasons famine, All broken Numbers, fractions, faction, fictions, Meer Mutabilities, selfe Contradictions, In Dock, out Nettle, here, there, every where, And in conclusion, no where, here nor there, The Phrase wherewith thy Verse are Beawtifide, Is onely where the King is Vileifide, And that for which thou most art Gratifide, Hath made a Thousand fooles mis-edifide; With impudence thou art so fortifide, And with Hipocrisie so Quallifide, And (to the World) thy selfe hast justifide, That from the World thou art cleane Mortifide, All which thy Boasting Rimes have certifide, For under thine own hand 'tis Testifide, And by a crew of Rebels Notifide, (Such as with Ignorance are Stupifide) That those bad times so fowle and Putrifide, By thy rare Writings are much purifide: And as we finde by warre so mundifide, Vnparallel'd and unexemplifide, (Or at the least so neatly rectifide) That thou deservest to be stellifide, Or Idoliz'd and almost Deifide, In the mean time thy fame is Magnifide, Thy person wondred at, and dignifide, And (if they could) thou should'st be satisfide, (Although themselves were double Damnifide) Thy Female faire, adorn'd and turpifide, Should, for thy services be Ladifide: All this by Fooles and Rebels Ratifide, Is by all wise men scorn'd and Nullifide. Our Miseries thou hast not mollifide, Thou our calamities hast amplifide, And this my Satyr's Lash hath verifide. This thou maist see, and this thou must allow, I can Rand words, and Rime as well as thou: Speak and write Nonsence, even by thy example, (Though not like thine Admir'd abroad so ample) Like to the inundation of a flame, Or like a Mad Lord, never out of frame, Or like the Entrailes of a purple Snaile, Or like the wagging of the Dog-starres Taile, Or like the Frost and Snow that falls in June, Or like sweet Musique, that was ne're in Tune: Or like a Ship that wants sides, Stem and Keele, Or like the Marrow-bones of Fortunes Wheele, Even such is Wither, like all these or nothing, Yet like himselfe, in every good mans Loathing. And is not this rare Nonsence, prethee tell, Much like thy writing, if men marke it well: For Nonsence is Rebellion, and thy writing, Is nothing but Rebellious Warres inciting. Base Scandall, Lyes, and Disobedience, Is most Ridiculous, and poor Nonsence, Ther's nothing is true sense, but what is true, And Hanging is good sense for such as you. Apollo made not thee his onely Heire In Poetry, I gat some part for my share, And though with Art thou partly art endo'wd, Yet God and Nature, me some Guifts allow'd: Which I (as my poor Tallent will extend) To Vindicate my wronged King I'le spend. Nor am I bound (whate're thou may'st suggest) To think 'mongst Englands Poets thou art best, Thy Verses many wayes applauded are Yet many that Boast lesse may reach as farre. Doth all invention in thy Braine Consist, Art thou the Bounds, the Limits and the List, The Longitude of Wit and Honesty, The Latitude of true Integrity; Art thou th'Hyperbole wonder, whose Rare Partes Is Non Plus Ultra, of all Armes and Artes, Art thou all this, the Devill thou art. Bragge on, My selfe once gat a Sippe of Hellicon, Which with Enthusiasmes did infuse Into my Braines some Rap'ts of every Muse, And therefore, I am sure, thou hast not all, I have my Portion too (although but small.) Which i'ft t'were lesse by halfe, I dare assay, To Cope with thee, in any Loyall way. But to write Verse, that may Rebellion breed Therein thou art too hard for me indeed.

[Hazlitt, No. 99.] [Concerning of the Crosse my faith is this] The verse has been extracted from prose text. Concerning of the Crosse my faith is this It is amisse, to such as mak't amisse. To such as reverence it or doe adore it, Or say their prayers to it or before it. Such do pervert it from its proper use, And turne an ornament, to an abuse. We use no crosse in Baptisme, with intent To adde some vertue to the Sacrament: Nor is it us'd at all, by any one Untill the Child be baptis'd, and alls done. Turkes, Pagans, Heathens, Infidels, and Jewes, They know not Christ, therefore no Crosse they use, But no true Christian, justly can repine To let a Crosse stand, as a Christian signe. Knaves may deface it, Fooles may worship it, And both are done for want of Grace, or Wit, Flagges, Ensignes, Armes for Sea, or Court, or Campe And all our monies beare the Crosses stampe. And those that wrong'd the Crosses here's my curse, May they want Crosses allwayes in their purse. THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTIES VVellcome to his owne House, Truly called the Honour of Hampton COVRT, VVho came thither on the 24. of August, and so consequently hoped and humbly desired to White-Hall.

A juster Master servants never had And servants false to man, to to bad But as the Eagle never cast his eyes, On abject, objects, vermin, gnatts or flies, So thou not minding injuries, hast still, VVith thine owne goodnes overcome their ill. Ingratefull men tooke cloathing, wages, food, From thee, and have repaid thee ill for good: Which thy Heroicke mind still slighted hath, As most unworthy of thy Royall wrath. Ther's not a grace, a vertue or an Art, But are inthroned in thy Princely Heart: Faith and Fame unshaken with the wrongs, Of perjur'd writers and perfidious tongues, Thy certaine Hope in thy Majestique Breast That fix'd beliefe, shall be made manifest By Charitie, which thou hast shew'd to those Who are thy cursed causeles mortall foes. VVhereby thy virtues patient constancy, Hath won thee a more glorious victory, Then if (by conquest) thy sharpe sword should peirce Through all the Kingdomes of the Universe. Thy Mercy and thy Iustice are the Jems, And richest Jewells in thy Diadems. To summe up all; 'tis truly understood Ther's nothing may be named just or good But is in thee ingraff'd, and nothing ill Thou sayst or do'st, but 'tis against thy will. Thy Master Christ (the light made thee discerne, And this blest Lesson thou from him didst learne. That he that Loveth, Father, Mother, VVife, Children, earths goods or glory, or his life More then his Saviour (such a sordid Spirit) Is most unworthy of his Masters Merrit: This precept thou hast practis'd this thy troath Kept in thy Christian Coronation Oath, Wife, Children, Crowne, and Kingdomes, friends, Life, all Thou hazzard'st either to rise, stand or fall, Thy Love (Great King) to thy great King of Kings, By thee hath been prefer'd above all things, For which he'le crowne his Gifts in thee, and hee Will crowne thee glorious with Eternitie: Thy Constancie hath trip'd up Fortunes heele, Thy mind ne're minded her Inconstant Wheele: What good, or bad Occurrances effected; Thy Spirits were ne're errected or dejected; Not with a stuped Humor stoicall, But with a Christian Mind Majesticall: And with Impregnable strong confidence, Still trusting in the Almighties Providence. Now may wee see that Patience, Clemencie, Religion, and true Magnanimitie, Are Talents lent, whose value doth excell: And all the Proffits their's that use them well. And (Royall Sir) Thou hast done well (no doubt) Thou hast not wrap'd thy Talent in a Clowte, But so improv'd thy trust, in thy Trustee, That tenfold ten times more thy trust shall bee. And now poore England, hath so many years Bin Plagu'd with causles Jellosies and Feares, Which (like Blacke clouds) disperst with wavering wind: Made Wit squint-ey'd, and Vnderstanding blind, Whearby each howre was frighted hence sweet Peace And every moment miseries encrease: But as bright Phebus (interpos'd by Clowds, Which with a mourning face the earth e'n shrowds) At last dispells them with his Radient Ray, And makes the dolsome darke, a gladsome day. So wee (mistaken Subjects) hood-winck over With Ignorance, our sights againe recover, King Charles shines cleare, as Sols Coruscant Beames Hath prov'd our Jeallous Feares wer lesse then dreames, Milde Dove-like King brings Peace with th'Ollive Braunch, Whose Love (like Balsome, Bleeding wounds will staunch Our chearefull faces, shewes our minds (like Mirrors) Free from suspitious thoughts, or needlesse Terrors: Hearts over flow'd with Joyes, Thankes up erected To God, who for us hath this good effected: Our joyfull eyes shewes Aprill drops of pleasure, And showrs of Joy fill th'Horizons measure, Th'Almightie hath thy troubles seene and heard, And hath thy upright heart in such regard That (mauger mischiefe) His outstretched Arme Hath, doth, and will defend thee still from Harme, Base Shiemei Railes not as he erst hath done, Nor rake-hell Sheba (Bieri's cursed sonne) Doth rore and raile with lowd Infernall yell, Or cry out, to your Tents o Israell That Sectaries no more contention Breed But humbly learne to know their Christian Creed, That Iudasses no more Hayle Master say When as they meane their Master to betray. That Reverend Levites of a new hatcht Brood, Make England drunk no more with English Blood. That we may have our Qveene and Prince once more, And use them Kinder then we did of yore. Triumphing trumpetts sownd shall mount toth' starres Hnd not the dreadfull charge of civill warres, Sweet Peace (we hope shall still the Churlish Drumb, And Murd'ring, Thundring, Guns. Commanded Dumb, Iustice and Mercy both Kisse (when they meete) No heavy sad complaining in our streete, No more shall England bath in her owne Gore, Or leading to captivity no more. Sword (drunk with blood) shall in their Scabberds rest, No plundering or free quartering shall molest. The painefull farmer, ploughman, or the swaine, And weapons shall give place to gownes againe. The Church resume her rights she had before, The Cleargie to be scandaliz'd no more. Thus each man hopes he shall his right enjoy And all cease one another to destroy. The King shall have his owne againe, and see, His enemies asham'd and odious bee. Upon thy Head still flourish may thy Crowne, And ten times troubled be thy high Renoune That thee and thine in glory here may Raigne, Untill the King of glory come againe: For such as speake peace, and doe warre intend, For any Sinister or private end. That of tranquillity doe prate and prattle, But wish for war, yet dare not see a Battle, Let all such never claime a Christian Name Whose trade or pleasure in Blood and Flame, Of their deere Country; to Rippe, Rend and teare, Their Mothers Woombe, which did such Bastards beare. Belike some feare that Peace would drive 'em hence To England New, or th'Isle of Providence: Virginia, Barmoodies, or St. Kitts. Barbadoes, Mevis, or besides their witts: But those that offering to the Altars bring, To raise new warres 'gainst Kingdome Lawes and King, Let them goe West-ward to the Triple tree, And like false Traitours, hang both he and shee. Those Sonnes of Hittits and of Amorites, God doe to them, as to the Midianites, As Heathen Sisera, and as Fabin dyd At Endors Field, (where Kishowes Brooke doth slyd) As they became as dunge, so let them be, That to a blessed Peace will not a gree, The peace of God, grant us thou God of Peace, Let us cease sinne, thou wil't our sorrowes cease. Let's frame our lives according to thy word And let no Sword be drawne, but Justice Sword, To which ends, thou good God of Consolation, Send happy peace to this afflicted Nation. So wellcome good King Charles to Hampton Court, And God be still thy shield, defence and Fourt. FINIS. 1648 An Ironicall Expostulation. ???-????????: OR, AN Ironicall Expostulation WITH DEATH and FATE, For the Losse of The late Lord Mayor of London; Who on Friday October 27. 1648. expired together with his Office; and both He and his Bay-Horse di'd o'th' Sullens. Si Cato reddatur, Cæsarianus erit. Martial. Fortune, thou art a Whore; and Death, thou art ('Tis ro be fear'd) a Cavaleer in Heart: You, that so formall stand with Scythe and Glasse, Think not in private with our Lord to passe. Was there but one choice peice? one dainty bit, And your leane ugly Jaws must fall on it? Were there not Dray-men, Butchers, plump and fat, But you must pick a Weasle out, a Rat? Was it you took a liking to the Elfe, For his Complexion, 'twas so like your selfe? Or for your Ease, lest a more weighty pack Should in the transportation break your back? Was it you found him grating of a scull Which you might call your owne, you did him cull? Or that his soveraign He was a Druggist in Bucklers Berry. Drugs restor'd a Brother, That through an Hurdle suckt (you'l say) his Mother? Was it you came before his Plots were ripe, And he refus'd to ask you, smoake a Pipe? If none of these, why then so hasty, Death? What, not afford a Lord Mayor two daies breath? When the Potato-Pies, and Capons were Bought, and in readinesse to end the year? If 'twas his lot to die, well; else 'twas base, To cull a Magistrate for's Chain, or Mace. This was plain Tyranny, we cannot blame Him for an Independent, when you came. Restore him to us; sure 'twas a mistake, King Noll and's Kindred else will make you quake. Was it for this he did so long oppose Monarchy, and Princes, to be led by th'Nose, And shown in Pluto's Court, with O yes! here Comes my Lord Mayre and's Horse; provide um cheere? Was it for this he became Pimp, to th'State, And to admit their Army op'd the Gate? While in Triumphant manner they bestrid London, like George on Horseback, as they rid? Was it for preservation of the flock, So many o'th' wicked he condemn'd to th'Block? And with his sword of Power cut in two What neither Law nor Justice e're could do? O Death! thou art ungratefull; he has sent More to thee in one yeare then th'Plague or Lent. By Proclamations, by Collections too 'Gainst th'Common Enemy what e're would do. I say again, restore, or wee'l appeale And have you put down Traytor under seale. Say Mr. Speaker, is't not Treason scan'd, For Death t'arrest a Member under hand And without th'Houses leave?—I know 'tis so, Youl find it—Caroli Vicesimo. Is't not against an Order lately made, All Members to be free, their debts unpaid? Did they not pitch upon a day, to wit, Doomsday ith' Afternoon to think on it? But all this will not do: hee's gon to tell Hampden and Brooks, and Pym the Newes in Hell. How there is Peace (God blesse us) coming on (That Antichristian brat of Babylon) When 'tis against his Conscience to submit Or have a finger in restoring it. Mr. Warner.Would not the world cry shame, should he accord VVho in his Name has War, and's Armes the sword? Hee's gon to tell them of a certain thing Coming to London, whom men call the King: Whose Scepter will out-sway, and bring in thrall Th'establish'd Government Anarchicall. And with his Radiant lustre quite dispell What for these seven years has been hatch'd in Hell. Yet let none say he's broke or run away, But (as the wiser call't) he did convey Himselfe into a Church, in policie, Where he was sure none would suspect him lie. No clamorous Bell pronounce his fall, no Gun, He was no Warriar, nor no Whittington. (Only the joviall Butchers (in the Stocks) Gave him a dismall peale with cleaver-knocks.) Let him sans Common-Prayer in silence passe, Be buried with the buriall of an Asse. So farewell horse and man, dead and forgot, Both infamous let both together rot. Rejoyce Apprentices, your day is come No more to stand in fear of Martyrdome: No more shall yee to Bridewell go, and pay For your extravagance the last Lords day. Now ye may circumambulate, and see Morefields and Islington without a fee. No more henceforth shall th'Surry Cavaliers Go home and shake their heads without their eares. All troubled waters now shall to their springs Returne, and one raigne, not five hundred Kings. Yet all this while we erre, and accuse Fate, When he his own end did accelerate; For having drunk a scruple over-night Of jealousies and fears, he took his flight. Thus Hanniball, and those heroick blades, Minding an easie way to get to th'Shades, Made use o'th' Druggists Art, and to provide 'Gainst future vengeance, drunk their dosse, and di'd. An Epitaph on the Mayor, &amp;c. Vnder this Tomb-stone lies a thing, Enemy both to Church and King. No Protestant, and yet no Papist, A Puritan, and yet an Atheist. For Magistracy a grand stickler, Yet a most zealous Conventickler: One that for Christ would live and die, (Yet kept no Christ-tide verily.) One that the Prophets slew, and took Th'Apostles badge from out the Booke. One that the Rubrick took away, And gave th'Apprentices Tuesday. One that did every thing amisse, Then riddle me, riddle me, who was this? An Epitaph on my Lord Mayors Horse. Here in this Oyle-Tub (Reader stand aloofe) Lies Great Bucephalus, beware his hoofe; Who out of a good nature needs would die, Meerly to keep his Master company. Bay was his name, some call'd him, Rosemary, For his victorious feats, and Chivalry: But if he had no name, the Bulks and Shambles Would speak him famous for his Christmasse Gambolls: When from an Amble to a Trot anon Bravely he trod down Superstition. For which rare service 'tis decreed he lie Pickled and Powder'd for Posterity. And live by this Inscription (somewhat course) Down went the Popish Rites, Grammercy Horse. A Dialogicall brief Discourse between Rainsborough and Charon, at their meeting, Octob. 29. 1648. Charon. Welcome to th'shades; hail Brother Rainsborough: I am a Boat-man, so were you. Most opportunely! See th'triumphant Mayor, (No lesse a man) is our first fare. Had you not come, his Honour had (by Styx) Fairl' in a Sculler gone t'Old Nick's. Rainsb. Now he may ride in Oares—forbeare; alas, He that you speak of may not passe.

I that on Earth was above Law, yet know How to conforme my self below. Charon. Hum! I have lost my Naula; let it go; Now to your businesse Rainsborough. Rainsb. Know then, that I from th'English Coast am sent By th'States, to know your Government. And e're the Vote passe, hence must have command, That the new Anarchy may stand: Speak Charon, speak; if Pluto think it good, I have already seal'd it with my blood. Charon. Dull Man, or Ghost; or whatsoe're thou art, Thou think'st to alienate my heart: Know'st not we have a Prince; and though the Devill, One that abjures all you that Levell? You that incroach, my Office to enjoy; Were you not once a Skippers Boy? By all th'infernall gods, lay by thy Spade, Or be suspected guilty Hell t'invade. Rainsb. No more; I yeeld: the Government stand, I was but sent here under-hand) Yet if our Agents with you here might try, They would put hard for Anarchy. Charon. Anarchy? Hell and Furies! such a word Once more, and thou go'st over-board. Belzebub, if he knew thee at this height, Would have thee carbonado'd streight. Leave us—and yet I'le write thy Epitaph, Meerly to make the Devill laugh. For, by the Rabbies leave, without controule, 'Twas not a So Walker upon Tho. Rainsborough, he that from an Ironmonger became a Newesmonger, &amp; now makes Hebrew Pot-hooks and Andirons cum privilegio. Fire removed his pure Soule. Epitaph. Weltring in blood see here an Horse-leech sprawll, Glutted and overcharg'd, yet loath to fall; Bred up 'ith Ocean; lately crept to th'shore, (Though he had all, yet covetous of more.) Which when the wise Phisitian saw, his thirst That 'twas unsatiable, let him burst: So having empti'd and disgorg'd his Maw, Hence through the Rubick sea he swam away. Feare not Colchestrian Dames, lest Lucas 'rise; Veng'ance is fully paid; Here Rainsb'rongh lies. FINIS. 1649. Wanderings to see the Wonders of the West. [Hazlitt, No. 106.] The verse has been extracted from prose text. The Bil of John Taylor, or a Taylors Bill, without either Imprimis, or Items. Old, lame and poor, by mad contentions beggerd, And round about vvith miseries beleaguerd: Too many Masters made me Masterlesse, Too many vvrongs have made me monylesse, Helples, and hopeles, and remedilesse, And every vvay encompast vvith distresse. To ease my griefes I have one trick of vvit, (If you that read vvill set your hands to it:) VVhich is, vvhen I do give you good account From London unto Cornevvals Michaels Mount, Of all my iourney, and vvhat Nevvs I found In ayre, or sea, above, or under ground; VVhen I do give you truths of this in Print, Hovv I did travell, gravell, dust, durt, flint, My entertainment, vvhere tvvas good, vvhere ill, Then (in good mony) give me vvhat you vvill, Your, nams &amp; dvvellings, vvrite that I may find you, And I shal (vvith my book) seek, find, and minde you, vvith humble thankes. Seven times at Sea I servd Eliza Queen, Since vvhen, I thrice in Germany have been, Once in Bohemia tvvixt Earth, Sea, and Sky, And once to Scotland, and the Mountains high: Then unto Quinbrough, in a Paper Boat, Then next (from London) I to Yorke did float VVith a small paire of Oares (or little VVherry) And in like fort from London to Salsberry. Next that my man and I did ride our Steedes To Leicefter, Lin, Hull, Hallifax and Leedes, Ore lofty mountains, vvher the vvinds blevv bleak, To Chester, Darby, and Devils arse a peak. Then vvith a Scullers boat to Cicester, From thence (up Seaverns flood) to Glocester, To VVorster, and the Tovvn of Shrevvsbery, From thence to Bristoll, and to Bath I fly; These are no fictions, or false Idle Tales, I passe from Bathe to the River VVye in VVales? Then Hereford did me vvell entertain, From vvhence I home came in my Boat again. Last (to the King) at the Isle of VVight I vvent, Since vvhen my best content, is discontent: Thus having traveld North, and South, and East, I meane to end my travels vvith the VVest. TAYLORS Westerne Voyage to the Mount. Tis a mad world (my masters) and in sadnes I travail'd madly in these dayes of madnes: Eight yeares a frenzy did this Land molest, The ninth year seem'd to be much like the rest, My selfe (with age, griefe, wrongs, and wants opprest, With troubles more then patience could disgest) Amongst those Isles, I chose the least and best, Which was to take this journey to the West: And sure it is an Argument most fit, That he who hath a portion of small wit As I have, and good store of friends, 'twere sloth And foolery, not to make use of both. My wit was worne thread bare, halfe naked, poore, And I, with it, went wool-gath'ring for more. This long walke (first and last) I undertooke On purpose to get money by my Booke: My friends (I know) will pay me for my paine, And I will never trouble them againe. Six hundred miles, I (very neere) have footed, And all that time was neither sho'd or booted; But in light buskins I perform'd this travell O're hill and dale, through dust, dirt, flint, and gravell. And now no more words I in vaine will scatter, But come unto the marrow of the matter. My Reader must not her suppose that I Will write a treatise of Geography: Or that I meane to make exact Relations Of Cities, Townes, or Countries scituations; Such men as those, I turne them o're to reade The learned Cambden, or the painefull Speed. And now (good Reader) I my muse do tune, I London left, the twenty one of June: To Brainford, Colebrooke, Maidenhead and Henly, I past (the weather faire, the high wayes cleanely) To Abington, where foure dayes I remain'd, By friends and kinsfolkes kindely entertain'd: Thankes to my Nephew John, with all the rest, To whom that time I was a costly Guest. [From nasty Roomes, that never felt broomes] From nasty Roomes, that never felt broomes, From excrements, and all bad sents, From childrens bawling, and caterwawling, From grunting of hogs, and barking of dogs, And from byting of Fleas, there I found ease. [Like to the stone of Sisiphus, I roule] Like to the stone of Sisiphus, I roule From place to place, through weather faire and foule, And yet I every day must wander still To vent my Bookes, and gather friends good will; I must confesse this worke is frivalowse, And he that (for it) daignes to give a lowse, Doth give as much for't as 'tis worth, I know; Yet meerly merily I this jaunt did goe In imitation of a mighty King, Whose warlike acts, good fellowes often sing, The King of France and twenty thousand men, Went up the Hill, and so came downe agen. So I this travell past, with cost and paine, And (as I wisely went) came home againe. FINIS. CHRISTMAS IN &amp; OVT: OR, OUR LORD &amp; SAVIOUR Christs Birth-Day. To the Reader. Good Joshua once ordain'd a Holy-Day, Because the Sun stood still in Gibeon, And at his Prayers that the Moon did stay His course, above the Vaile of Aialon: And shal not Christians stil give thanks &amp; praise On th'yearly day our blest redeemer came? Shall Powder Treasons and thanksgiving dayes Be still observed in Records of Fame? Then let not Christs Birth-Day forgotten bee, Remember him that doth remember thee. Thine JOHN TAYLOR. A SHORT RELATION OF A LONG IOURNEY Made ROUND or OVALL The verse has been extracted from prose text. To all my Honourable, Worshipfull, and honest Friends, that have subscribed to this following Bill; I humbly desire them to read it againe, and consider the Contents of it, and content mee accordingly. A Taylors Bill, with few or no Items: by or for John Taylor. Now in the seventy fourth yeare of mine Age, I take an English and Welsh Pilgrimage: From London first I bend my course to Chester, And humbly I to all men am Requester; That when I have past over Hills and Dales, And compast with my Travels famous Wales, That when to you that I a Book do give, Relating how I did subsist and live, With all my Passages both here and there, And of my Entertainment every where. Write but your Names and Dwellings in this Bill, I'le finde you, for the Book give what you will. Twelve Voyages and Journies I have past, And now my Age sayes this may be my last. My Travels Story shall most pleasant be To you that read, though painfull unto me. A Short Relation of a Long Iourny, &amp;c. A Traveller that loves to see strange Lands, May be a man or not a man of's hands: But yet 'tis very requisite and meet, He should be furnish'd with good brains and feet; For he that wants legs, feet, and brains, and wit, To be a Traveller is most unfit: And such am I by Age of strength bereft, With one right leg, and one lame left leg left. Beggers on their backs their brats do reare; But I my issue in my leg do beare: I dresse it often and impatiently It lies and cries not, though it make me cry; Yet I dare challenge Scottish Jock or Jackey, Or any light-heel'd nimble footed Lackey, To travell such a Jaunt as I have done, With th'right leg going, and the left leg run: Or if I please, the case I'le alter so, To make the worst leg run, the best to goe. And sure my heart was stout, men may suppose, To venture Travell with such legs as those. But there be some few that do understand, 'Tis merry walking with a horse in hand. Such was my Lot, I had a stately Courser, None courser quality'd, and for a worser, There's neither Halifax, or Hull, nor Hell, That for good parts my horse can parallel; He was a beast, had heated been and cheated, Too much hard over rid and under meated, That he as gaunt as any Greyhound was, And for a Horses Skelliton might passe: You might have told his ribs, he was so thin, And seen his heart and guts, but for his skin; He was not pursie foggy, cloy'd with greace, And like his Rider lov'd rest, ease, and peace: Dun was, and is the Dumb beast, and was Done, E're I begun, or he with me begun. He had a black List, from the Mane to Taile, Which is a colour that doth seldome faile: To change of paces he had been inur'd, But yet not one t'endure, or be endur'd; His Trot would fling a Dagger out ot'h sheath, Or jolt a man to death, or out of breath. His Ambling was invisible to me, From such smooth easie garbs his feet were free: His common Pace in Sun-shine or in showre, Was (as he pleas'd) about two mile an houre. I never yet could put him in a sweat, For he was never free, but at his meat. Thus John upon Dun's back, were both Dun John, And thus the tedious way we wandred on. Now to proceed in order duly, truly, I London left the thirteenth day of July: The Wayes as faire as man could well desire, 'Cause I had none to draw Dun out o'th mire: I fifteen miles (to Rislip) that day went, Baited at Edgworth, to give Dun content; There my acquaintance, of good fame and worth, Did welcome me: the next day I set forth, With Boots, Sans Spurs, with Whip, and Switch of Burch, I got on, twenty miles to Stoken Church: The fifteenth day, S. Swithin, I and Dun, Did shuffle sixteen miles to Abington; There till the Tuesday following I abode, From thence I sixteen miles to great Tue rode, There at the Swan mine Host was free and kind, He had but one eye, tother side was blinde; But surely he a right Good-fellow was, And there one night my Dun did eat good grass. On July's twenty one from Tue I went, And unto Warwick strait my course I bent, There did I find another signe o'th Swan, Mine Hostesse kind, mine Host a Gentile man, And for your love to me, good Master Venner, With humble thanks I am your praises Penner. My gratitude to Master Jacob Harmer, His Drapers shop could never make me warmer, Then high and mighty Warwick's drink did there, It made my brains to Caper and careere, It was of such invincible strong force, To knock me (in five miles) twice from my Horse: And sure I think the Drink was certainly Infused with the conqu'ring ghost of Guy. On July's two and twentieth day I came Unto an ancient house call'd Hunningham, There were two Ladies of good Worth and fame, Whom for some reasons I forbeare to name: Their Son and Grandson (John) I'le not forget, He's nobly minded as a Baronet; Foure dayes they kept me with exceeding cheere, And gave me silver because Travels deare. From thence my Journey 5 miles I pursue, To Coventry, most famous for true blew; There the faire Crosse of ancient high Renown Stands firme, though other Crosses all are down. 'Tis a dry City, and dry let it be, 'Twas not made dryer one small drop for me: Like a Camelion there I brake my fast, And thence I twenty miles to Lichfield past; There at the George I took my lodging up, I well was lodg'd, and well did sup and cup, When there by chance, I cast my wandring ey on The ruin'd Church, with griefe I thought on Sion: I sigh'd to see that sad confusion, Like th'Hebrews by the Brook of Babylon. On July's twenty seventh I rode alone Full sixteen miles unto a Town call'd Stone. Next day to Nantwich sixteen long miles more, From thence to Chester near the Cambrian shore: There was my welcome in such noble fashion, Of which in Prose I'le make some briefe Relation. [The next day when the Clock strook two and fowre] The next day when the Clock strook two and fowre, I mounted Dun, Dun mounted Penmen Mawre; And if I do not take my aime amisse, That lofty Mountain seems the Skies to kisse: But there are other Hils accounted higher, Whose lofty tops I had no mind t'aspire: As Snowdon, and the tall Plinnillimon, Which I no stomack had to tread upon. Merioneth Mountains, and Shire Cardigan To travell over, will tire horse and man: I, to Bewmaris came that day and din'd, Where I the good Lord Buckley, thought to find: But he to speak with me had no intent, Dry I came into's house, dry out I went. I left Bewmaris, and to Bangor trac'd it, Ther's a brave Church, but Time and War defac'd it: For Love and Mony I was welcome thither, 'Tis merry meeting when they come together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND COLLECTION THE Suddaine Turne of ffortunes wheele; OR A Conference holden in the Castle of St. Angello, betwixt the Pope, the Empero? and the King of Spaine. FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT IN THE POSSESSION OF THE REV. T. CORSER THE VIZAGE, COMPLEXION, fface or Preface of the Booke. Preface. Doth time retort, or Fortune play the Iade, Or doth the course of fate run retrograde? Is hap turn'd haples, or is chance chance Medly, Or what strainge wonders strickes our foes so deadly? Hath Rome with Ceasar and most mightie Spaine Soe long held Fortune pris'ner in a chaine, Whereby warr with a bloody invndation O'rewhelm'd and halfe extirp'd the German nation; And is she now broake loose and chaung'd hir grownd, With fauour smileing where she long hath frown'd? These shifteing trickes doth to the world present That fortunes fauoures are not permanent: Then fortune, fate and chance and lucke are fictions, Dreames and Phantasmaes full of contradictions, And nothing constant in the world wee see But HE that Was, and IS, and still shalbe. HE made all thinges, and all thinges that are made Are mutable, and doe increase or fade; HE calls himselfe I AM, the present tense, Who's euer present in omnipotence; He's still the same almightie, iust and pure, And no iniquitie he cann indure; HE sees our sinnes with his all seeing Eye; Which doe for vengeance to his iustice crye, For which he long hath suff'red his deere vine To be opprest, and rooted vp by swine, For 'tis a Maxim that hath alwaies bin, That punishment doth euer follow sinn. Now, in his owne good time, he heares the cryes Of his aflicted churches Miseries, He's graciously pleas'd his hands to staye And turne his furious wrath another way, Seeinge his people hath so long bene try'de And with aflictions purg'd and purifi'd, Their patience and their sufferings being soe Which made some feare a finall ouerthrowe. But he that doth his chosen Israell keepe, Who neither slumbers nor did euer sleepe, Himselfe now takes his owne great cause in hand, And doth his vauntinge Enemies with stand; Which makes our foes complot, consult, and plod How and by what meanes they may warr with God; As in these followinge lines I doe explaine, Twixt Rome, the Empire, and most mightie Spaine. Tis plainely writt, and harsh and rudely pen'd, And hopes it shall noe honest man offend. A CONFERENCE HOLDEN IN THE CASTLE OF ST. ANGELLO BETWIXT THE POPE, THE EMPEROUR &amp; THE KING OF SPAINE. Pope. Welcome deere Sonnes vnto our court of Rome; Blessinges Apostolique and holie doome Sheild all the house of Austria from mischance, And both their fortunes and their crownes advance. Emperour. Thy feete most holy ffather doe I kisse; Of churches benediction if I miss, Th'Imperiall crowne from Austria wilbe gone, Which heauens forbid, for then w' are all vndone. Bohemias rebells doth with Sueden ioyne The heretiques from Donan to the Rhyne; Their heades, their armes, their forces they combine 'Gainst Rome and Austria and the Palatine That cursed Caluinist, with his partakers, Those damned Schismatickes the church forsakers, Vpon our ruine seeke to build their fortune, Which makes me thus thy Holines importune. Pope. The keys of Peeter and the sword of Paule Shall shutt and open, cutt in peices all, The gates of Heauen, Nations lawes and rights, And turne cleare daies into the darkest nightes. Their land, that haue our dignitie withstood, I'le make Aceldema a feild of blood; 'Gainst heretiques I'le thunder out my bulls, And make their land a place of dead mens skulls. Some saintes I will enforce and some implore, And hell and purgatory both shall rore, E're one of Caluins or of Luthers sect With Roman Bayes or Eagles shalbe deckt. Emperour. The threats and Curses of the Catholickes Are now despis'd by those vile heretickes; They hold your blessinge in no more avayle Then is the flapping of a fox his taile. In breife they all soe desobedient are, That for your Bliss or Ban they feare nor care; Helpe by your Counsell therefore (Holie Sir) And shew vs meanes to quiet all this stir. Pope. Thou maiest by reasons and Embassages, By questions, answers, and like passadges, Win time a while; but these are out of date, Now swordes, not wordes, doe kingdomes arbitrate; And wee haue vs'd delaies and sleights so oft, That all our Enemies perceiue our Croft. Vnto thy neighbour freinds and subiects send, That from surprise thou maiest thy selfe defend; My Legates and my Nuncies I'le dispatch More forces 'mongst the Catholickes to hatch; Mentz, Cullein, Triers, Catholike Bauare, Thou hast in Germany, with others there, From Flaunders, Brabant, and the Poleish King, Thy true freindes, quickly will their succoures bring; And though my selfe with Florence may not send Our armes soe soone, our mony wee will lend: The Cantons of the Swittzers shalbe wadg'd, Who to our sea do hold themselues ingag'd: I'le send to Vrbin and to Mantua, Vnto Ferara and to Genoa, To Sauoy, to Pimont, and to Venice, To ffraunce (our eldest sonn) and to St. Denis: I'le fetch the saintes from heauen, the feinds from hell, But I'le those druncken German traytors quell: Besides thy spanishe Cousin present here, Whom Europe and the new fownd world doth feare, The Churches Atlas and the Empires propp: By streinth, by witt, or gold we meane to stopp These proud attempts and darings of the dutch, And breake their forces cost it nere so much. Spaine. If Ceasar and your Holines haue done, Obserue the answere of your Spanish sonne: Nor German Prelates or Bauaria can, Nor King of Pole, your selfe, nor anie man, Nor Florence duke, nor Brabant ioynd with Flaunders, Nor Cantons Catholicke with their Commaunders; If these were ioyn'd in one yet could they not, With all the force that can by them be gott, Bring timely succores 'gainst this coniuration These Almaine Graues haue made in euery nation. Expect not helpe from Sauoye or Venetia, Who feare and deadly hate the house of Austria: I looke for nothing from my brother ffraunce, For if he saw vs downe he'll sing and daunce: And Ceasar, if at home thou lookst for ayde, Thy state is tottering and thy streinth decay'd; Thine Austrian subiects likewise are infected With Luthers heresie, and haue reiected The Papall dignitie, and may doe thine, And with their fellowe Lutherans combine; And if for succoures thou doe send to Thracia, The faithles Turkes thou know'st will not from Asia. Spaine then must helpe, or what shall Ceasar doe, And how can Spaine helpe Rome and Ceasar to? Shall Indian armies be recal'd from thence? Italian forces martch away from hence; Leaue Millaine, Naples, and our siluer fountaines Vnguarded, naked, and martch o're the mountaines? Through Grissons country lead the streinth of Spaine; Or venter our Armadoe once againe To narrowe seas, and soe at once loose more Then wee haue gott in six score yeares before? Soe thou at Vien, I at Arragon, May shaue our heades, turne Monkes, and liue alone. You count your freindes, but count not all your foes, Whose streinths, whose numbers you cannot opose; The Northerne trackt of Europe from Brittania, Tending to East as farr as Transiluania, Saue Holland, and some trifles, are their owne. Aye me! fowerscore yeares how are they growne. Three Kingdomes England, Scotland, Ireland be, With Denmarke, Norway, Sueden, six you see, Besides those two which they haue won from thee, Being eight in all; and our Kings are but three. The numbers of their Princes, Dukes and Countes, With their free Lords and stats, oures farr surmountes: Besides their many Palsgraues and their Mortgraues, With all their Lantgraues, Rhinegraues, and their Burgraues. And as their numbers soe their spirrits are, Made great with hopes by their prodidgious starr, Which blaz'd o're Germany the last December, Portending chaunge of stats; and I remember Their oppositions and their calculations Of times, of scepters, and of scituations; Of Rome, of Babell, and of hills and dales, Of beastes and draggons, and such fearefull tales, Wherewith they cheare themselues and triumph soe, As if th'had giuen vs all the ouerthrowe. The eleuenth and twelfe of Esdras they applye Against th'Imperiall Eagles monarchie; And that the Lion comeing from the wood Is of the King of Sueden vnderstood; And that the Lion shall the Eagle foile, And in triumphant sort deuide the spoyle. The rebells make constructions on this text, Whereby the Catholickes are sorely vext; As th'Eagles wings doth o're th'Empire spread, Euen so the Lion is the armes of Sued, And Sued (they say) true annagram'd is Deus, Whom they doe hold the Christian Macchabeus; They further saye Gustauus is his name, Which is Augustus in his Annagram. Pope. An vncouth shiuering makes my blood to thrill And strainge amazement doth my sences fill. I wonder much that they soe skillfull be, Against vs to applye the Prophesie: I also doe admier how they could frame Such annagrams on Sued and Suedens name. But though those hopes their forward minds may cheare, Let our imperious thoughts contemne all feare; For 'tis not ffortunes turning of hir wheele Can make our noble resolutions reele; Doubt not but I will find a stratagem T'vphold Rome, Ceasars, and Spaines diadem. Spaine. But, holie ffather, I am certifi'd That they your power and pollicy deride, And how of you they made an Annagrame, The best and bittrest that their witts could frame, As thus: Supremus Pontifex Romanus. Annagramma. O non sum super petram fixus. Most sacred Pastor of the Christian flocke, They say thou art not fixed on the rocke; And I suspect that they are all inclin'd That what they say they doe beleiue in mind. Alas for Rome! alas for fferdinand! Alas for Phillip, must he needs with stand His owne, the empire and the churches foes, And so himselfe, the Church and Empire lose! Pope. And doe they find such strainge predictions out To fill the Catholikes with feare and doubt? I'le make them knowe that I am fixed fast On Peeter, and shall neuer downe be cast: My benediction or my malediction Can raise in state, and ruine with afliction. The heretiques on Peeters faith doe build; But I vpon his person am vpheld, And from him vnto me all power is giuen To bind and loose, to shutt and open heauen, And whilst I keepe the keyes none shall come in That in these madd rebellious warrs haue binn. Emperour. All you can say, and all you can deuise, They vallue not, but vtterly despise. The Duke of Saxon from our side is gone, And with the King of Sued conioyn'd as one: And why should I from him expect for more, Then Charles my predecessor did before, Who gaue him all and more then I can mention? Yet shortly after, in that great contention Twixt him and Luthers rebells, he forsooke His benefactor, and against him tooke. And by these Ciuill warrs what is our gaine? Our people more then millions haue bene slaine; Dampeire, Buequoy, and many valient men, Whose like wee haue no hope to haue agen: Our subiects with great taxes rent and rack'd, Our Prouince laied wast, our citties sack'd, Our fruitfull feildes vntil'd and vnmanur'd, Loss vpon loss, past hope to be recur'd: Maides, wiues and widdowes rauish'd and deflowr'd; Our land with spoile and rapine all devour'd; Fire, sword and famine hath these twelve yeares space Rag'd all mine Empire o're in euery place: Our freindes fall off, our treasury exhausted, Our selfe with greife and age decay'd and wasted; And all the mischeifes that by warr can fall, Wee and our people haue endur'd them all; Whilst many thousands that were wont to giue, Now begg or starue, or miserably liue; And last, that most vnlucky ouerthrowe, My trusty Tillies loss, a deadly blowe. Prague and Bohemias kingdom, all is gone; Our townes of ffranckfurt and of Hanow wone, Hall, Haluerstadt and Heinst, with mightie Mentz; Our cheife Elector bishopp fled from thence: My generalls Walsteine and don Baltazarr Fled to Polonia from the rage of warr. This makes our foes with victorie to swell, And all is worse then tounge or pen can tell. Spaine. Noe Prince with me in losses may compare, For I haue had more then a double share. Great damage I haue had in Asia; And Pernambucco in America, With places of importance in Braseele, The furious force of chance and chaunge doth feele: Mine India shipps surpris'd, my subiects slaine, Wherein consisted halfe the hope of Spaine: Besides in Belgia I haue had mishapp; My towne of Weazle taken in a trapp; The Buss a place of great importance lost, Long time defended with exceeding cost; And late that vnrecouerable stroake In Zealand, where our forces all were broake; Sloopes, punts and lighters, seauenty eight confounded, Six thousand men tane pris'ners, many wounded; Fower thousand hand granadoes and of brass Fower hundred thirty peices taken was; Eleuen barrells of good mony tane, And many hundredes of my souldiers slaine; With store of powder, shott and ammunition, All lost in that vnlucky expedition. All this the last September was atcheiued, For which our foes reioyce, our freindes are greiued; Whilst onely Dunkirke, man'd with runagadoes, Against mine enemies haue made brauadoes. They onely haue done thinges of speciall notes, Taken some merchants and small fisher boats, And now and then a collier, or a katch With oysters, seldome meeteing with their match; For with braue acts their fame abroad is hurl'd, As if they had subdu'd and wone the world, When euery wiseman knowes well and beleiues Their towne and shipps to be but dens for theiues. Haue all my auncestors to six descents, By conquests, wedlocke, and like liggaments, Ty'd earledomes, dukedomes, Crowne and Empire fast, And is the period of our greatnes past, And our declineing now begin to hast, Hopeing for westerne monarchie at last? Nassaw, Nassaw, you hatefull sonnes and father, Curst be your name and house: you, you did gather The fearefull rebells into warlike bands, Who now doe state it in the Netherlands; There, there you writt Nill vltra once againe, And set vp Easterne pillars barrs to Spaine. Emperour. Thus are our danegers, these our greifes related; Thus are our minds perplex'd, our harts amated. If Rome have any secret wisedome hid Laied vp for euill times, or euer did Make wicked heretiques feele churches power, Then, father, now's the time and this the hower. Remember how two Frederickes heretofore Frighted thy predecessors; this may more Hazzard thy fortunes, vtterly suppress Thy selfe, the Roman church and vs, vnless By some prime stratagem fetch'd from the deepe Thou dost thy selfe and freinds from damage keepe. Pope. And are our freindes soe fewe and so vntrustie, And be our foes so many and so lustie? One Innocent in Rome, in former ages, Hath vs'd three Kings for lacques and for pages; And dare they nowe against our likeing make Both Kings and Ceasars? then, you furies, wake! Helpe me to store of pistolls, poysons, kniues, To fire and powder, manacles and giues. Bid Rauillack and Clement hye them hither; Let Guido Faux and Garnett come togeather; All those that doe in Pollicy excell, Sonnes of Iscariott and Achittophell. Come, ye Ignatians, bring ye assassinates, Left handed Ehuds that doe rule the fates And cutt the threades of Princes liues assunder; These Roman Sceueloes shall make men wonder, To see these vpstarts all with their partakers, In euerie nation slaughtred by massacres. I'le raise vp Suares, Parsons, Bellarmine, And Loyalla their father, and refine All humane witt to one pure quintessence, Against whose vertue shal be no defence. My sonnes therefore at nothinge be dismaied, Remember what your father now hath saied; You to Viena, you to Siuill goe, Helpe as you maye to giue the fatall blowe. FINIS. The Fearefull Summer: OR, Londons Calamitie, The Countries Discourtesie, And both their Miserie. To the truely Generous and Noble Knight, Sir Iohn Millissent, Serjeant-Porter to the Kings most Excellent Majestie. Right worthy Knight, when first this Book I writ To You, I boldly Dedicated it: And having now enlarg'd both Prose and Rime, To you I offer it the second time. To whom should I these sorrowes recommend, But unto You, the Cities Noble Friend? I know you are much grieved with their griefe, And would adventure Life for their reliefe: To you therefore these Lines I Dedicate, Wherein, their Sorrowes partly I relate, I humbly crave acceptance at your hand: And rest Your Servant ever at command, John Taylor. THE Fearefull Summer: OR, Londons Calamitie. The Patience and long-suffering of our God, Keeps close his Quiver, and restraines his Rod, And though our crying Crimes to Heav'n doe cry For vengeance, on accurst Mortality; Yea though wee merit mischiefes manifold, Blest Mercie doth the hand of Iustice hold. But when that Eye that sees all things most cleare, Expects our fruits of Faith, from yeere, to yeere, Allowes us painefull Pastors, who bestow Great care and toyle, to make us fruitfull grow, And daily doth in those weake Vessels send The dew of Heaven, in hope we will amend; Yet (at the last) he doth perceive and see That we unfruitfull and most barren be, Which makes on us his indignation frowne, And (as accursed Fig-trees) cut us downe. Thus mercy (mock'd) plucks justice on our heads, And grievous Plagues our Kingdome over-spreads: Then let us to our God make quicke returning, With true contrition, fasting and with mourning: The Word is God, and God hath spoke the Word, If wee repent hee will put up his Sword. Hee's griev'd in punishing, Hee's slow to Ire, And Hee a sinners death doth not desire. If our Compunction our Amendment show, Our purple sinnes Hee'll make as white as snow. If wee lament, our GOD is mercifull, Our scarlet crimes hee'l make as white as Wooll. Faire London that did late abound in blisse, And wast our Kingdomes great Metropolis, 'Tis thou that art dejected, low in state, Disconsolate, and almost desolate, The hand of Heav'n (that onely did protect thee) Thou hast provok'd most justly to correct thee, And for thy pride of heart and deeds unjust, Hee layes thy pompe and glory in the dust. Thou that wast late the Queene of Cities nam'd, Throughout the world admir'd, renown'd, and fam'd: Thou that hadst all things at command and will, To whom all England was a hand-maid still; For Rayment, Fewell, Fish, Fowle, Beasts, for Food, For Fruits, for all our Kingdome counted good, Both neere and farre remote, all did agree To bring their best of blessings unto thee. Thus in conceit thou seem'dst to rule the Fates, VVhilst peace and plenty flourish'd in thy Gates, Could I relieve thy miseries as well, As part I can thy woes and sorrowes tell, Then should my Cares be eas'd with thy Reliefe, And all my study how to end thy griefe. Thou that wer't late rich, both in friends and wealth, Magnificent in state, and strong in health, As chiefest Mistris of our Countrie priz'd, Now chiefly in the Country art despis'd. The name of London now both farre and neere, Strikes all the Townes and Villages with feare; And to be thought a Londoner is worse, Than one that breakes a house, or takes a purse. Hee that will filtch or steale now is the Time, No Justice dares examine him, his crime; Let him but say, that he from London came, So full of Feare and Terrour is that name, The Constable his charge will soone forsake, And no man dares his Mittimus to make. Thus Citizens plagu'd for the Citie sinnes, Poore entertainement in the Countrie winnes. Some feare the Citie, and flye thence amaine, And those are of the Countrie fear'd againe, Who 'gainst them barre their windowes and their doores, More than they would 'gainst Turkes, or Iewes, or Moores, I thinke if very Spaniards had come there, Their well-come had been better, and their cheare. Whilst Hay-cock-lodging, with hard slender fare, Welcome like dogges unto a Church they are, Feare makes them with the Anabaptists joyne, For if an Hostesse doe receive their coyne, She in a dish of water, or a paile, Will new baptize it, lest it something aile. Thus many a Citizen well stor'd with Gold, Is glad to lye upon his mother mold, His bed the map of his mortalitie, His curtaines Clouds, and Heav'n his Canopie. The russet Plow-Swaine, and the Leathern Hinde, Through feare is growne unmannerly, unkinde: And in his house (to harbour) hee'l preferre An Infidell before a Londoner: And thus much friendship Londoners did win, The Devill himselfe had better welcome bin: Those that with travell were tir'd, faint, and dry, For want of drinke, might starve, and choke, and dye: For why the hob-nail'd Boores, inhumane Blocks, Uncharitable Hounds, hearts hard as Rocks, Did suffer people in the field to sinke, Rather than give, or sell a draught of drinke. Milke-maides and Farmers wives are growne so nice, They thinke a Citizen a Cockatrice, And Countrie Dames are wax'd so coy and briske, They shun him as they'l shun a Basiliske: For every one the sight of him will flye, All fearing he would kill them with his eye. Ah wofull London, I thy griefe bewaile, And if my sighs and prayers may but prevaile; I humbly beg of God that hee'l bee pleas'd, In Jesus Christ his wrath may be appeas'd, With-holding his dread judgements from above, And once more graspe thee in his armes of love. In mercie all our wickednesse remit, For who can give thee thankes within the pit? Strange was the change in lesse than three months space, In joy, in woe, in grace, and in disgrace: A healthfull April, a diseased Iune, And dangerous Iuly, brings all out of tune. That Citie whose rare objects pleas'd the eyes With much content and more varieties, She that was late delightfull to the eares, With melody Harmonious, like the Spheares: Shee that had all things that might please the scent, And all she felt, did give her touch content, Her Cinque Port scences, richly fed and cloy'd With blessings bountifull, which shee enjoy'd. Now three months change hath fill'd it full of feare, As if no Solace ever had beene there. What doe the eyes see there but grieved sights Of sicke, oppressed, and distressed wights? Houses shut up, some dying, and some dead, Some (all amazed) flying, and some fled. Streets thinly man'd with wretches every day, Which have no power to flee, or meanes to stay, In some whole street (perhaps) a Shop or twaine Stands open, for small takings, and lesse gaine. And every closed window, doore and stall, Makes each day seeme a solemne Festivall. Dead Coarses carried, and recarried still, Whilst fiftie Corpses scarce one grave doth fill. With Lord have mercie upon us on the doore, Which (though the words be good) doth grieve men sore. And o're the doore-posts fix'd a Crosse of red, Betokening that there Death some blood hath shed. Some with Gods markes or Tokens doe espie, Those Markes or Tokens, shew them they must die. Some with their Carbuncles, and Sores new burst, Are fed with hope they have escap'd the worst: Thus passeth all the weeke, till Thursdayes Bill Shewes us what thousands Death that weeke did kill. That fatall Bill, doth like a Razor cut The dead, the living in a maze doth put, And he that hath a Christian heart, I know, Is griev'd, and wounded with the deadly blow. These are the objects of the Eye, now heare And marke the mournefull Musicke of the Eare; There doe the brazen Iron tongu'd loud Bells, (Deaths clamorous Musicke) ring continuall knells, Some loftie in their notes, some sadly towling, Whil'st fatall Dogges made a most dismall howling. Some franticke raving, some with anguish crying, Some singing, praying, groaning, and some dying, The healthfull grieving, and the sickly groaning. All in a mournefull diapason moaning. Here, Parents for their Childrens losse lament; There, Children grieve for Parents life that's spent: Husbands deplore their loving Wives decease: Wives for their Husbands weepe remedilesse: The Brother for his Brother, friend for friend, Doe each for other mutuall sorrowes spend. Here, Sister mournes for Sister, Kin for Kin, As one griefe ends, another doth begin: There one lyes languishing with slender fare, Small comfort, lesse attendance, and least care, With none but Death and hee to tug together, Untill his Corps and Soule part each from either. In one house one, or two, or three doth fall, And in another Death playes sweepe-stake all. Thus universall sorrowfull complaining, Is all the Musicke now in London raigning, Thus is her comfort sad Calamitie, And all her Melodie is Maladie. These are the objects of the Eyes and Eares, Most wofull sights, and sounds of griefes and feares. The curious taste that whilome did delight, With cost and care to please the Appetite; What she was wont to hate, she doth adore, And what's high priz'd, she held despis'd before; The drugs, the drenches, and untoothsome drinkes, Feare gives a sweetnesse to all severall stinckes; And for supposed Antidotes, each Palate Of most contagious weeds will make a Sallate, And any of the simplest Mountebankes, May cheat them (as they will) of coyne and thankes, With scraped pouder of a shooing horne, Which they'l beleeve is of an Unicorne: Angelicaes, distastfull root is gnaw'd, And Hearbe of grace most Ruefully is chaw'd; Garlicke offendeth neither taste nor smell, Feare and opinion makes it rellish well; Whilst Beazer stone, and mightie Mithridate, To all degrees is great in estimate: And Triacles power is wondrously exprest, And Dragon water in most high request. These 'gainst the Plague are good preservatives, But the best Cordiall is t'amend our lives: Sinn's the maine cause, and we must first begin To cease our griefes, by ceasing of our sinne. I doe beleeve that God hath given in store Good Medicines to cure, or ease each Sore; But first remove the cause of the disease, And then (no doubt but) the effect will cease: Our sinne's the cause, remove our sinnes from hence, And God will soone remove the Pestilence: Then every med'cine (to our consolation) Shall have his power, his force, his operation; And till that time, experiments are not But Paper walls against a Canon shot. On many a post I see Quacke-salvers Bills Like Fencers Challenges, to shew their skills; As if they were such Masters of defence, That they dare combat with the Pestilence, Meet with the Plague in any deadly fray, And bragge to beare the victory away; But if their Patients patiently beleeve them, They'l cure them (without faile) of what they give them; What though ten thousands by their drenches perish, They made them purposely themselves to cherish: Their Art is a meere Artlesse kinde of lying, To picke their living out of others dying. This sharpe invective no way seemes to touch The learn'd Physician, whom I honour much, The Paracelsians and the Galennists, The Philosophicall grave Herbalists: These I admire and revereuce, for in those God doth Dame Natures secrets fast inclose, Which they distribute as occasion serve Health to reserve, and health decay'd conserve: 'Tis 'gainst such Rat-catchers I bend my pen, Which doe mechanically murther men, Whose promises of cure (like lying knaves) Doth begger men, or send them to their graves. Now London, for thy sence of feeling next, Thou in thy feeling chiefly art perplext; Thy heart feeles sorrow, and thy body anguish, Thou in thy feeling feel'st thy force to languish, Thou feel'st much woe, and much calamitie, And many millions feele thy misery; Thou feel'st the fearefull Plague, the Flix, and Fever, Which many a soule doth from the body sever: And I beseech God for our Saviours merit, To let thee feele the Comfort of the Spirit. Last for the solace of the smell or scent; Some in contagious roomes are closely pent, Whereas corrupted aire they take, and give Till time ends, or lends liberty to live. One with a piece of tasseld well tarr'd Rope, Doth with that Nose-gay keepe himselfe in hope: Another doth a wispe of Wormewood pull, And with great judgement crams his nostrils full: A third takes off his socks from's sweating feet, And makes them his perfume alongst the street: A fourth hath got a pownc'd Pommander Box, With worme-wood juice, or sweating of a Fox, Rue steep'd in vineger, they hold it good To cheere the sences, and preserve the blood. Whil'st Billets Bonefire-like, and Faggots drie Are burnt i'th streetes, the Aire to purifie. Thou great Almightie, give them time änd space, And purifie them with thy heavenly Grace, Make their repentance Incense, whose sweet savour May mount unto thy Throne, and gaine thy favour. Thus every sence, that should the heart delight, Are Ministers, and Organs to affright. The Citizens doe from the Citie runne. The Countries feares, the Citizens doe shunne: Both feare the Plague, but neither feares one jot The evill wayes which hath the Plague begot. This is the way this Sicknesse to prevent, Feare to offend, more than the punishment. All Trades are dead, or almost out of breath, But such as live by sicknesse or by death: The Mercers, Grocers, Silk-men, Gold-smiths, Drapers, Are out of Season, like noone-burning Tapers: All functions faile almost, through want of buyers, And every Art and Mystery turne Dyers: The very Water-men give over plying, Their rowing Trade doth faile, they fall to dying. Some men there are, that rise by others falls, Propheticke Augurists in Urinals, Those are right Water-men, and rowe so well, They either land their Fares in Heav'n or Hell. I never knew them yet, to make a stay And land at Purgatorie, by the way: The reason very plainely doth appeare, Their Patients feele their Purgatorie here. But this much (Reader) you must understand, They commonly are paid before they land. Next unto him th'Apothecary thrives By Physicke Bills, and his Preservatives: Worme-eaten Sextons, mightie gaines doe winne, And nastie Grave-makers great commings in: And Coffin-makers are well paid their rent, For many a wofull woodden tenement; For which the Trunke-makers in Pauls Church-yard, A large Revenue this sad yeere have shar'd, Their living Customers for Trunkes were fled, They now made Chests or Coffins for the dead. The Searchers of each corps good gainers be, The Bearers have a profitable fee, And last, the Dog-killers great gaines abounds, For braining brawling Curres, and foisting hounds. These are the Grave Trades, that doe get and save, Whose gravitie brings many to their grave. Thus grieved London, fill'd with moanes and groanes, Is like a Golgotha of dead mens bones: The field where Death his bloody fray doth fight, And kil'd a thousand in a day and night. Fair houses, that were late exceeding deare, At fiftie or an hundred pounds a yeere, The Landlords are so pittifull of late, They'l let them at a quarter of the rate. So hee that is a mightie moneyed man, Let him but thither make what haste hee can, Let him disburse his Gold and Silver heape, And purchase London, 'tis exceeding cheape; But if he tarry but one three months more, I hope 'twill be as deare as 'twas before. A Countrie Cottage, that but lately went At foure markes, or at three pounds yeerely rent; A Citizen, whose meere necessitie Doth force him now into the Countrie flie, Is glad to hire two Chambers of a Carter, And pray and pay with thankes five pounds a quarter. Then here's the alteration of this yeere, The Cities cheapnesse makes the Countrie deare. Besides, another mischiefe is, I see A man dares not be sicke although he be: Let him complaine but of the Stone or Gout, The Plague hath strooke him, presently they doubt: My selfe hath beene perplexed now and then, With the wind-Collicke, yeeres above thrice ten, Which in the Country I durst not repeat, Although my pangs and gripes and paines were great: For to be sicke of any kind of griefe, Would make a man worse welcome than a thiefe; To be drunke sicke, which er'st did credit winne, VVas fear'd infectious, and held worse than sinne. This made me, and a many more beside, Their griefes to smother, and their paines to hide, To tell a merry tale with visage glad, VVhen as the Collicke almost made me mad. Thus meere dissembling, many practis'd then, And mid'st of paine, seem'd pleasant amongst men, For why, the smallest sigh or groane, or shrieke, VVould make a man his meat and lodging seeke. This was the wretched Londoners hard case, Most hardly welcome into any place; VVhilst Country people, whereso'ere they went, VVould stop their noses to avoid their sent, VVhen as the case did oft most plaine appeare, 'Twas only they themselves that stunke with feare. Nature was dead (or from the Country runne) A Father durst not entertaine his Sonne, The Mother sees her Daughter, and doth feare her, Commands her on her blessing not come neere her. Affinitie, nor any kinde of Kinne, Or ancient friendship could true welcome winne; The Children scarcely would their Parents know, Or (did if they) but slender duty shew: Thus feare made Nature most unnaturall, Duty undutifull, or very small, No friendship, or else cold and miserable, And generally all uncharitable. Nor London Letters little better sped, They would not be receiv'd (much lesse be read) But cast into the fire and burnt with speed, As if they had been Hereticks indeed. And late I saw upon a Sabbath day, Some Citizens at Church prepar'd to pray, But (as they had been excommunicate) The good Church-wardens thrust them out the gate. Another Country vertue Ile repeat, The peoples charitie was growne so great, That whatsoever Londoner did dye, In Church or Church-yard should not buried lye. Thus were they scorn'd, despised, banished, Excluded from the Church, alive, and dead, Alive, their bodies could no harbour have, And dead, not be allow'd a Christian Grave: Thus was the Countries kindnesse cold, and small, No house, no Church, no Christian buriall. Oh thou that on the winged Winds dost sit, And seest our misery, remedy it, Although we have deserv'd thy vengeauce hot, Yet in thy fury (Lord) consume us not: But in thy mercies sheath thy slaying Sword, Deliver us according to thy Word: Shut up thy Quiver, stay thy angry Rod, That all the World may know thou art our God, Oh open wide the Gate of thy Compassion, Assure our Soules that thou art our Salvation: Then all our thoughts, and words, and works, we'l frame To magnifie thy great and glorious Name. The wayes of God are intricate, no doubt Unsearchable, and passe mans finding out, He at his pleasure worketh won'drous things, And in his hand doth hold the hearts of Kings, And for the love which to our King he beares, By sicknesse he our sinfull Country cleares, That he may be a Patron, and a Guide, Unto a people purg'd and purifi'd. This by a president is manifest; When famous late Elizabeth deceast, Before our gracious Iames put on the Crowne, Gods hand did cut superfluous branches downe, Not that they then that were of life bereft, Were greater sinners than the number left: But that the Plague should then the Kingdome cleare, The good to comfort, and the bad to feare: That as a good King, God did us assure, So hee should have a Nation purg'd and pure. And as Elizabeth when she went hence, Was wayted on, as did beseeme a Prince: Of all degrees to tend her Majestie, Neere fortie thousand in that yeere did dye, That as shee was belov'd of high and low, So at her death, their deaths their loves did show; Whereby the world did note Elizabeth, Was lovingly attended after death. So mightie Iames (the worlds admired mirour) True faiths defending friend, sterne Foe to Errour, VVhen he Great Britaines glorious Crowne did leave, A Crowne of endlesse glory to receive, Then presently in lesse than eight months space, Full eighty thousand follow him apace. And now that Royall Iames intombed lyes, And that our gracious Charles his roome supplies, As Heav'n did for his Father formerly, A sinfull Nation cleanse and purifie: So God, for him these things to passe doth bring, And mends the subjects for so good a King. Upon whose Throne may peace and plenty rest, And he and his Eternally be blest. FINIS. Drinke and welcome: OR THE FAMOVS HISTORIE of the most part of Drinks, in use now in the Kingdomes of Great Brittaine and Ireland; with an especiall declaration of the potency, vertue, and operation of our English Ale. [Thou shalt be from disease and weaknesse free] Thou shalt be from disease and weaknesse free, From mone, from care, long time of life to thee Shall by more friendly fate afforded be: Drinke Sack therefore if you'l be rul'd by me. Here followeth, a laborious and effectuall discourse, in praise of the Element of all Waters fresh and salt, with their opperation; with a touch of the causes of all sorts of weather, faire and foule. I that of Earth was made, yet no earth have, No not so much as may afford a grave: For when that death my lives thred shall untwine I have no buriall in a ground that's mine: Of all the Elements, the Earth is worst; Because for Adams sinne it was accurst: Therefore no parcell of it will I buy But on the VVater for reliefe relie. When as mans crying crimes in volleyes flew To Heaven, and Heavens high vengeance downeward drew: Then Water all the World did overrunne, And plagu'd th'abuses that on Earth were done. From showres of Water, rain'd from Skies to Earth, Spring, Sommer, Harvest, Winter have their birth. For VVater is the Milke of Heaven, whereby All things are nurs'd, increase and multiply. The oldest and most grave Astronomers, The learned'st and most sage Philosophers Doe hold, that in the highest Altitude A spheare of Water is, in Amplitude Envelloping all other Orbs and Spheres, With all the Planets swift and slow careares, Even as the Sea the Earth doth compasse round, The Water so the Firmament doth bound. Should I of Water write, but what it is, I should be drowned in my Theames Abysse: And therefore I'le but dabble, wade, and wash, And here and there both give, and take a dash. In blest Records it truely is approv'd, That Gods blest Spirit upon the Waters mov'd: Then All things were involved in the Waters, All earthly, Airie, and all firie matters: Vntill th'Almighty (whose workes all are wonders) With saying (Let there be) the Chaos sunders. Of a confus'd lump, voyd of forme and fashion, He spake, and gave the world its faire creation. And as at first the Waters compast all The Chaos, or worlds universall Ball. So still, of all the workes of God, most glorious The water was, is, and will be victorious. It doth surmount the Ayre, the fire it quenches With Inundations it the Earth bedrenches: The Fire may burne a house, perhaps a Towne, But water can a Province spoyle and drowne: And Ayre may be corrupted, and from thence, A Kingdome may be plagu'd with pestilence: Where many die, old, young, some great, some small, But water flouds plaies sweep-stake with them all. Earth may be barren, and not yeeld her store: Yet may she feed the rich, and starve the poore. But Earth in triumph over all ner'e rid, As in the Diluge once the Waters did. Warre may make noyse with Gunnes and ratling Drums, But Water, where it comes, it overcomes. Thus Earth, nor Ayre, nor Fire, nor rumbling Warre, Nor plague, or pestilence, nor famine are Of powre to winne, where Water but commands, As witnesse may the watry Netherlands. Concerning Merchandise, and transportation, Commerce and traffique, and negotiation, To Make each Countrie have by Navigation The Goods, and Riches of each others Nation. Commodities in free community, Embassages for warre or unity: These blessings, by the Sea, or some fresh River Are given to us, by the All-giving Giver. And in the vasty and unmeasur'd roome Of Neptunes Regiment, or Thetis wombe, Are almost shapes and formes of all the things Which in the Earth, or Ayre, or dies, or springs. Ther'e Fishes like to Sunne or Moone, and Starres, Fowles of the Ayre, and weapons for the Warres, Beasts of the Field, and Plants and Flowers there, And Fishes made like Men and Women are. All instruments for any Art or Trade, In living formes of Fishes there are made. This is approv'd, if any man will seeke In the first day of Bartas his first weeke, Heaven hath ordain'd the watry Element To be a Seale and sacred Sacrament, Which doth in Baptisme us regenerate, And man againe with God doth renovate. And as it in the Laver (mysticall) Doth cleanse us from our sinne originall: So for our corp'rall uses 'tis most meete To wash our cloathes, and keepe us cleane and sweet. Wer't not for Water thus we plainelie see, No Beast on Earth more beastly were than wee. Our selves with nastinesse our selves should smother, Or with our owne stench poyson one another. It keepes our vessels cleane to dresse our meate, It serves to cleanse and boile the meate we eate. It makes our houses hansome, neate and cleane, (Or else the mayd is but a fluttish queane) Thus Water boyles, parboyles, and mundifies. Cleares, cleanses, clarifies, and purifies. But as it purges us from filth and stincke; We must remember that it makes us drinke, Metheglin, Bragget, Beere, and headstrong Ale, (That can put colour in a visage pale) By which meanes many Brewers are growne Rich, And in estates may soare a lofty Pitch, Men of Good Ranke and place, and much command Who have (by sodden Water) purchast land: Yet sure I thinke their gaine had not been such Had not good fellowes vs'de to drinke too much; But wisely they made hay whilst Sunne did shine, For now our Land is overflowne with wine: With such a Deluge, or an Inundation As hath besotted and halfe drown'd our Nation. Some that are scarce worth 40 pence a yeere Will hardly make a meale with Ale or Beere: And will discourse, that wine doth make good blood, Concocts his meat, and make digestion good, And after to drinke Beere, nor will, nor can He lay a Churle upon a Gentleman. Thus Bacchus is ador'd and deifide, And We Hispanializ'd and Frenchifide: Whilst Noble Native Ale, and Beeres hard fate Are like old Almanacks, Quite out of Date; Thus men consume their credits and their wealths, And swallow sicknesses, in drinking healths, Untill the fury of the spritefull Grape Mounts to the braine, and makes a man an Ape, A Sheepe, Goate, Lion, or a Beastly swine, He snores, besoyl'd with vomit and much Wine. At Good mens Boords, where oft I eate good cheere, I finde the Brewer honest in his Beere. He sels it for small Beere, and he should cheate, In stead of small to cosen folks with Greate. But one shall seldome find them with that fault, Except it should invisibly raine Mault. O Tapsters, Tapsters all, lament and cry, Or desp'rately drinke all the Tavernes dry: For till such time as all the Wine is gone, Your are bewitch'd, and guests you shall have none. Then to the Tavernes hye you every man: In one day drinke foure Gallons, if you can, And with that tricke (within a day or twaine) I thinke there will but little Wine remaine. Your hopes to hoppes returne againe will be, And you once more the golden age will see. But hold, I feare my Muse is mad or drunke, Or else my wits are in the wetting shrunk: To Beere and Ale my love hath some relation Which made me wander thus beyond my station. Good Reader be my Priest, I make confession, I pray thee pardon me, my long digression. From Beere and Wine to water now a while, I meane to metamorphose backe my stile. Wer't not for Water, sure the Dyers would die, Because they wanted wherewithall to dye. Cost would be lost, and labour be in vaine, 'Tis Water that must helpe to die in Graine. They could then feare no colours, it is cleare, Want water, and there will be none to feare. The Fishmongers, (a worthy Company) If VVater did not still their Trade supply, They would be Tradefalne, and quite downe be trod, Nor worth the head or braine-pan of a Cod. Then Lent and Ember-weekes would soone be shotten, All fasting daies would quickly be forgotten: Carthusian Friers, in superstitious Cloysters VVould want their sttirring Cockles, Crabs and Oysters: And Catholicks turne Puritanes straight way, And nevermore keepe Lent or fasting day. But leaving Neptune, and his Trumping Triton, Of other VVaters now I meane to write on, (Exhal'd by Phœbus from the Ocean maine) Of Clowdes, of misty Fogs, all sorts of Raine, Of Dew, of Frosts, of Haile, of Ice of Snow VVhich falls, and turnes to water here below, Of Snow and Raine, as they together meet VVell mingled in the Ayre, are called Sleet. Of Springs, of petty Rils, of Chrystall Founts, Of Streamelets here my merry Muse recounts; Of Foordes, of Brookes, of Rivers, Lakes and Bournes; Of Creekes, of Ebbes and flouds, and their returnes, Of Gulphs, ponds, Whirlpooles, Puddles, Ditches, Pooles, Of Moates, of Bathes, some hot, and some that cooles, Of Waters, bitter, sweet, fresh, salt, hot, cold, Of all their operations manifold; These (if I can) I'le mention with my Pen And last of Urin and strong Watermen. Of Clouds.A Cloud's a Vapour, which is cold and moyst, Which from the Earth, or Sea, the Sunne doth hoyst Into the middle Region of the Ayre, And is (by extreame cold) congealed there, Untill at last, it breake and fals againe, To Earth, or Sea, in snow, sleet, Haile or Raine. Of Mists.Mists are such clouds, which neere the earth doe lye, Because the sun wants strength to draw them high. When radiant Sol displaies his piercing Beames Of Raine.Into a cloud, it Thawes, and Raines, in streames: And as the cloud is distant neere or farre, So, great, or small the showrie droppes still are. Some men ('gainst Raine) doe carry in their backs Prognosticating Aking Almanacks: Some by a painefull elbow, hip, or knee, Will shrewdly guesse, what wether's like to be: Some by their cornes are wondrous Weather-wise, And some by biting of Lice, Fleas, or Flies: The Gowt, Sciatica, The Gallian Morbus, Doth oft foretell if Tempests shall disturbe us; For though these things converse not with the stars, Yet to Mans Griefe they are Astronomers; In Spring time, and in Autumne Phœbus Ray From land and sea drawes vapours in the day, Which to th'Ayres lowest Region he exhales, Dew.And in the night in pearly dew it fals. Here oft fall Meldewes, sweet as Hony; And Dew oft turnes Manna in Polonia land. Twixt Dew and Hoare-frost, all the ods, I hold Hoare frosts One comes from heate, the other from the cold. Hayle is an Ice which oft in flawes and stormes Hayle. In spring and Harvest fals, in sundry formes; For in the Autumne, Winter, or by night Scarce any Hayle within our land doth light. And last comes Snow, the cold'st of Winters Weathers, Snow. Which fals and fils the Ayre with seeming feathers. These from the land, and from the Ocean Maine, The Sun drawes up, and then lets fall againe. Thus water universally doth fly From Earth and skie to Sea, from them to Sky: For 'twixt the Firmament, the land and Ocean, The Water travels with perpetuall Motion. Now, from the Airy Regions I descend, And to a lower course my study bend: He that of these things would know more, may please To looke them in some Ephimerides. Springs, (in the Earth) I doe Assimulate Springs. To veines of Man, which doe evacuate, And drop by drop through Cavernes they distill, Till many meetings make a petty Rill: Which Rill (with others) doe make Rivolets, And Rivolets, Brookes, Bournes and foords begets, And thus combined, they their store deliver Into a deeper trench, and make a River. Then Rivers joyne, as Isis doth with Tame, Rivers. And Trent with Owse, and Humber doth the same. These altogether doe their Tributes pay Unto their soveraigne Ocean night and day. These make Dame Tellus wombe to fructifie, As blood in veines of men doe life supply. Lakes in low vallied Grounds have Generation, Lakes Or from some severall Rivers Inundation. Some Lakes seeme Oceans, amongst which are these The Dead-lake, Hircan, and the Caspian seas. A Whirpooles like unto state policy Not to be sounded, but with jeopardy. Hot Bathes doe spring from Brimstone veines, whose heat For many cures have opperetion great. Some minerall earth is bitter, and doth make The water issuing thence, that taste to take. In Scicily, they say, there is a VVell VVhose water doth for Vinegar serve well. A VVell neere Bilen in Bohemia lies VVhich (like burnt VVine) the Countrey there supplies. And divers springs in Germany there be, VVhose taste with Vinegar, or VVine agree. For there the Brimstone mines, and Minerals VVith Fumes infusing vapours up exhales And with the waters doe incorporate Hot, cold, sweet, sowre, as they ennaccuate. Some Rivers are of such strange working might, VVhich dranke (by sheepe) doth change them black from white, Some that with bathing cure, blind, deafe, and lame, And makes mens haire red that doe drinke the same, Some are at noone key-cold, at midnight hot, Some makes a man mad, some a drunken sot, Some are in summer cold, in winter warme, And some are banefull, full of poysn'ous harme. Some (do with lust) make mens affections burne, And some (through coldnesse) wood to stones will turne, Some will quench burning torches straite, and then Dip'd in the water they are light agen, I read that in Silicia one may finde A well which if Thieves drinke of, are strucke blinde, My selfe, and many thousands more than I Would (rather then to drinke thereof be drie.) If Brittaines waters all were such, I thinke That few of us would dare thereof to drinke: I could write more of strange wells opp'rations: And waters of our owne and other Nations. But Doctour Fulk of late hath writ a booke, Of Met'ors, and who lifts therein to looke, May read, and reading may be well suffic'd, So learnedly he hath Epitomiz'd. There are two Springs, which women (when they mump) Or lumpish lowring from their eyes can pumpe, And in those pearly streames the foole, and witty, Hath oftentimes beene duck'd or sous'd with pity: Kinde hearted men are drown'd in sorrow deepe When they doe see a handsome woman weepe. But Aprill like, soone dry and quickly wet (As anger, love, or hate doe rise or set,) But as for those that truely spring from griefe, I wish them consolation and Reliefe. Now (to ecclips the vigour of the Vine) We have strong waters, stronger much than Wine: One with a quart of water drunke may be, When (of the best wine) he may hold out three, The sellers of these waters seldome row, And yet they are strong-water-men, I know. Some water-men there are of sight so quicke, They'l tell by water if a man be sicke, And (through the urinall) will speedily Finde out the cause, the griefe and remedy. These men deserve much honour, love and thankes. But hang base pispot cheating Mountebankes. 'Twere fit the Ratcatchers with them should be, Combin'd in one, and at one Hall made free. I could speake why the sea doth ebbe and flow, And why 'tis salt, but Doctour Fulke doth show Compendiously, as I have said before; And therefore here I'le touch these poynts no more. Month changing Luna, hath the government O're all the various watry element, And as the Moone is mutable even so The waters still are turning to and fro: 'Tis smooth, 'tis rough, deepe, shallow, swift and slow, Whose motion doth perpetuall ebbe and flow: Most weake, most strong, most gentle, most untam'd Of all the creatures that were ever nam'd: It is so weake that children may it spill, And strong enough millions of men to kill: As smooth as Glasse, as Rugged as a Beare, Weake, and yet greatest burthens still doth beare, And as the waters from the Moone doth carry Her inclination, and like her do vary: So I (a Water-man) in various fashions, Have wroate a hotchpotch here of strange mutations, Of ancient liquors, made by Liber Pater, Of drinkes, of Wines, of sundry sorts of Water: My Muse doth like a Monkey friske and frigge, Or like a Squirrell skip, from twigge to twigge: Now sipping Sider, straightway supping Perry, Metheglin sweet, and Mead, (that makes her merry) VVith Braggot, tharein teach a Cat to speake, And poore Pomperkin (impotent and weake) And lastly (as the chiefe of all the rest) She tipples Huff-cap Ale, to crowne the feast, Yet now and then in Beere and Balderdash Her lips she dips; and cleane her entrailes wash: And ending, she declares Sack's mighty power, VVhich doth time, coyne, wit, health, and all devoure. Not by the mod'rate use, but by th'abuse Which daily is in universall use. For Rhenish, Claret, White, and other Wines They need not the expression of my lines; Their vertue's good, if not commix'd impure, And (as they'r us'd) they may both kill or cure. Through drinks, through wines, and waters, I have run, And (being dry and sober.) I have DONE. Iohn Taylors last Voyage, AND ADVENTVRE, PERFORMED from the twentieth of Iuly last 1641. to the tenth of September following. The verse has been extracted from prose text. To his Friend M?. John Tayler, on his voyage and Iourney. If true affection doth your muse inspire To'th honor'd welfare of your native place, Then set your hand to now I you desire, The time is now, when you may do us grace. This subiect sure is large, if you thinke of it You are not bounded, but you may at ease Survey, collect the good the honour profit Of trade, of Citie, Countrey, Rivers, Seaes. It may provoke some yet not thought upon To raise the ruines of this decayed place; To prosecute this hopefull worke begun And leave some honour to our after Race. From ancient Monmouth Geffery tooke his name, So Henry did from Huntington likewise; Why may not Gloucester ad to Taylors fame, Since that from thence his birth and name did rise. Gloucester this 3 of August, 1641. Yours to command Henry Ellis. Iohn Taylor Water-Poet Anagramme: Loapety-Troianroweth. Strange Newes! There is arrived at our Key; A wandring Poet alwaies in his way; Whose wilfull Errors makes him thus to vaunt, Æneas-like, I came from Troyonvant. I rowed in Rivers sometimes checkt by Milles, Steer'd under Bridges, and came over Hilles. The Oares of pleasure and of profit brought This Water-Poet hither in his boat; And hence he must, but yet he will I trow To the Brittaines rather then the Latines row: English will serve him rightly to rehearse His crooked travells in good prose or verse. When as the winds of fancy cease to blow him, If he have watermen to row or tow him; Expect Relations, I beleeve in fyne The Poets waterworkes will goe in wine, And all his dry-land passages appeare With casuall events both here and there. Now I doe wish he may accomplsh it Without expence of any thing but wit. Gloucester 3, August. 1641. Yours Io. Dorney. IOHN TAYLORS LAST VOYAGE, AND ADVENTVRE performed from the twentieth of Iuly last 1641. to the tenth of September following. Of famous Rivers, Brooks, Bournes, Rills, &amp; Springs, Of Deepes and Shallowes my invention Sings, Of Rocks Impenetrable, fourds and Mills, Of Stopps, and Weares, Shelves, Sands, and mighty Hills, Of Navigable passages (Neglected) Of Rivers spoyl'd, men begger'd and deiected. Of Tame, of Isis, Seaverne, Wye and Teme Lugge, Loden, Doyre, and Monnoes Pearly Streame, Of these, of more than these, and of their Vses, And of their miserable strange Abuses. I truely treate, that men may note and see What blessings Navigable Rivers bee, And how that thousands are debar'd those blessings By few mens Avaritious hard oppressings. I also shew how those faults may be mended And no man have just cause to be offended. And with a paire of Oares (for that intent) I once from London unto Lincolne went, Whereas a passage seven miles was cut thorowe From Lincolne into Trent, and to Gainsborowe; That way I past, and into Humber past To Hull, from thence to Owse, and Yorke at last, Another Voyage to the West, againe I (with a Wherry) past the raging Maine From London to the Isle of Wight and thence To Salisbury (with Time and Coynes expence) Since when our gratious soveraigne did ordaine The Viscount Dorchester to take the paine To view what wrongs the River Thames did beare I served then, and every Stoppe and Weare And all impediments, I found I writ And (hoping for amendment) printed it. For care was taken, and true industrie That from faire Oxfords University To London I Annottomiz'd the flood And shew'd it's qualities both bad and good. Promise was made, Thames wrongs should bee reform'd And some small helps were speedily perform'd But yet not halfe is done that then was spoken (All promises are either kept or broken) For as a monument, of our disgraces The Rivers too too fowle in many places. I have describ'd heere many an injury In three great Rivers, Severne, Thames, and Wye) Besides two Rivers Avon, one makes speede To Bristol, (and doth make it rich indeede.) And would Bathe cure that Rivers great amisse That City would be richer then it is, But each man to himselfe beares private love And no man will the generall griefe remove. The other Avon Ruines past Gloster West From Bristols Avon fifty miles at least, It glides to Stretford Towne from Coventry And into Severne falls at Tewxbury. Of Rivers, many writers well have done Grave Camden, Draytons Polyolbyon, And painefull Speede, doth in his Mappes declare Where all these Brookes and waters were and are, But yet not any one have sought (but I) To finde their wrongs, and shew some remedy. I shew the meane neglect of Navigation For few mens profit, publique lamentation, To encrease some five or fixe mens Treasury Whiles twenty thousand lives in misery, From shore to shore brave Rivers are dam'd so That not a woodden dish hath roome to go, No not a hand breadth, but that all is stop'd And from the poore man all reliefe is stop'd. It is the goodnesse of our God to give To us foure Elements, whereby we live: Those Elements, Fire, Water, Ayre are nam'd And Earth (of which althings are made and fram'd, And all those blessings, the great God of Heaven (Some more, some lesse to every man hath given. By ayre and breath (and breath no man buy Ayre serves all creatures in community) And though earth yeeld materialls for the fire Which many a sonne (by right) holds from his sire, Yet sure me thinkes the water should be free For passage, for all men of each degree. And though the Rivers in proportions are Shar'd thine, or mine, or this or that mans share, Yet sure, when God gives water, boates to beare It should not be stop'd up, with Mill or Weare. And now my meaning plainer to disclose, A little while I'le turne my Verse to Prose. [For who can (but with pittie) here behold] For who can (but with pittie) here behold These multitudes of mischiefes manifold, Shall Rivers thus be barr'd with stops and locks, With Mills, and Hills, with gravels beds, and rocks: With weares, and weedes, and forced Islands made, To spoyle a publique for a private Trade? Shame fall the doers, and th'Almighties blessing Be heap'd upon their heads that seeke redressing. Were such a businesse to be done in Flanders Or Holland mongst the industrious Netherlanders, They to deepe passages would turne our hils, To Windmills they would change our watermils. All helps unto these rivers they would ayd, And all impediments shall be destroyed: Our vagabonds (the wandring brood of Caine,) They would inforce those runnagates take paine, Whereby much profit quickly would accrue, (For labour robs the hangman of his due.) In common reason, all men must agree: That if these Rivers were made cleane and free, One Barge, with eight poore mens industrious paines, Would carry more than forty carts or waines. And every waine to draw them horses five, And each two men or boye, to guide or drive. Charge of an hundred horse and eighty men With eight mens labour would be served then, Thus man would be imployd, and horse preserv'd, And all the Countrey at cheape rates be serv'd. 'Tis said the Dutchmen taught us drinke and swill, I'm sure we goe beyond them in that skill, I wish (as we exceede them in what's bad) That we some portion of their goodnesse had: Then should this worthy worke be soone begun, And with successefull expedition done? Which I despaire not of, but humbly plead, That God his blessings will increase and spread On them that love this worke, and on their heires, Their goods and chattels, and on all that's theirs? I wish them blest externall, and internall And in the end with happinesse eternall. FINIS. Heads of all Fashions.

To the gentle Reader Distracted fame throughout the world so spreads, That monster-like, she now hath many heads, A man can goe to no place, but shall heare Things that may make him hope, and make him feare: But I doe hope, and hope I will doe still, All shall be well in spite of little Will, Or any of his Crew, farre off or neare, Whose practices doe every day appeare Still more and more, the Lord sees how they deale, And doth their Plots and Projects all reveale; Each City and each Towne, yea every village, Can fill us now with newes, we need not pillage. Tom Long and's men, rare tydings will relate, Some of high Powr's and Peeres, some of the State, Some of Religion, or Church Discipline, Some of this Bishop, some of that Divine; Some of a Knot of villaines late found out, Heav'ns mend or end that base conspiring rout. Some brings us newes from Ireland, false or true, How ever all is calld both true and new, Within one day a man may undertake Briefe notes of thousands severall things to make, If he writes halfe what he shall heare or see, Newes-mongers now have such varietie, That let them make reports, till tyr'd or dumbe, Their last newes scarce is told, but newes is come To wait their next attendance to be spread, By this meanes fame hath got a monsters head, Yea many heads, whereof I found a few, And here have laid them open to thy view, Peruse them all, in earnest or in jest, And tell me which amongst them is the best. If Round-head should be found the best to be, Farewell all other heads, Round-head for me. But gentle Reader, give me thy good word, And then I care not what Round-heads afford. Thine without hypocrisie. J. M. A Round-head at randome. VVhen as the worlds foundation first was laid, A Round-head was the first head that was made, Adams head and Eves head were both as one, So all, each following Generation. That since the time of Adam hath ensu'd, Hath formed beene to that similitude. All Nations farre or neare, ere knowne or found, Like English men have had their heads still round, Why then should any at Rounds-heads admire? Since all from Adam come our Great-grand-sire? To answer this: these times are full of Gall, And there's no head, no man that can please all. But as this head is understood of late, Some hold it scarce a friend toth' King and State. And some suppose it, whereso er'e it lurch, To be a great disturber of the Church I can say nothing, but as people say, One might this Round-head otherwise display, And if youle have't more couched, more concisely, More puuctuall, more briefly, and precisely. Then thus; 1 A round-head is a man whose braines compact, Whose Verilies and Trulies are an Act Infallible, beyond the vaine compare Of ord'nary men, what ere they are. This head, though sometimes owned by a widgion, Can make new moulds to shape a strange Religion. 2 A Square-head is exact in many rules, Knowes Horses, Asses, very well from Mules, He is in Aglebra, and Musicke skil'd, His braine-pans with a thousand crotchets fil'd; And yet of late as I have heard some say, He cant endure to heare the Organs play. 3 A Solid-head is one whose every part, Is furnished with nature and with Art, Hath all the faire endowments can be given By the auspicious Stars or powers of Heaven: If this head be well guarded with Gods grace, Tit fit for Church or State, or any place. 5 An Empty-head hath still a shallow braine, Yer good enough to beare a Bishops Traine, For that's now fallen full low, ev'n to the ground, Old Canterburies pride hath pul'd all downe: That little VVill, together with the VVren, Hath pluckt the Pope almost from out his den. 4 An Hollow-head is one that is concave, Joyn'd to an hollow-heart makes up a Knave, This Hollow-head comes neere the empty Pate, Good wit doth seldome enter in thereat. He that the name of Hypocrite knowes well, This Hollow-head or Hollow-heart may spell. 6 A Full-head is full fraught with braines or guts, Whose teeth are sound, can cracke the hardest nuts, His grinders are at best, his eares and eyes Are firme and good. free from infirmities: His nose is perfect, pure, and he can tell Which men are knaves, which honest by the smell. 7 A Deepe-head head hath an apprehensive braine, Dives far into the plots of Pope and Spaine, If well affected to the King and State, And to the Gospell, who can blame this pate? Yet there are many now which nere knew Schooles Would raise up selfe-conceit, make wise men fooles. 8 A Great-head may containe a world of wit, For there is roome enough to harbour it, Some mighty-headed pleaders I have knowne, And yet their Great-heads little Law have showne: But what talke I of heads? it is the braine Enables them there cases to explaine. 9 A Little-head (if not with madnesse gored) May with much wit enriched be, and stored, And then if well inclin'd towards God and King, How many great things may this small head bring: But ill disposed (as many such there be) It brings the body to disgrace wee see. 10 A Long-head cannot weare a little cap, The forehead is so distant from the nap, This head hath many whimsies in the Braine, Yet wonders much at Rome, at France, and Spaine: These many plots have wrought against our Land, But this Long-head hopes they shall nere long stand. 11 A Short-head hath a kind of Brittle wit, Can understand and breake Jests for a fit, His Pericranium being thin and tender. It followeth his Ingence must needs be slender: He is not strong enough to be a Baker, Yet he may serve to be a Comfit-maker. 12 A Tall-head like a Pyramide or Steeple, Ore tops the common sort of vulgar people, Tis often on a Pimps broad shoulders placed, And thinks it selfe with bushy locks much graced. This head is mounted up so in the Aire, That there can nothing grow (I feare) but haire. 13 A Flat-head is not puffed up with fat, But yet it is a downe-right head that's flat, It hath no braines strange projects to devise, Nor will be drawne aside by Toyes or lyes: It wants a bulke for mischieves there to swarme, It doth small good, and it doth little harme. 14 A Strong-head though it be not made of brasse, Remembreth every thing that comes to passe Within the reach of's eye, his eare or knowledge, His Skull for skill, and strength may be a colledge: If he had beene a Fencer by his fate He would have scorn'd to feare a broken pate. 15 A Weake-head may ingenuous be aud witty, Adorn'd with sundry graces, but tis pitty, The frailty of this head doth now and than Make him forgoe the best parts of a man: Bacchus into his braines may sometimes steale And rob his senses of their common-weale. 16 A Thicke-head is an head consolidated Quite opposite, unto the hollow pated, The Frontispice it had from Taurus browes, More thicke and wrinkled far then any Cowes. This head is so substantiall, that a man May count it for an Oxe head now and than. 17 A Thin-head be it empty, be it full, Tis but composed of a Paper skull, The eyes are hallow and the cheekes are thin, The jaw-bones threaten to run through the skin: This head if you the face doe well examine, Like Pharoahs seven leane Kine, protends a famine. 18 A Plaine-head is a plaine well-meaning head, Who as he thinkes no harme, no hurt doth dread, So quickly may be gul'd, for honest men Are often cheated every now and then: This head is often free unto its friend, Yet many times tis cozen'd in the end. 19 A Forked-head (if you the fame could uote) Is like the head of any Bull or Goate, Yet some affirme that most men of this kind Doe weare their hornes (Ram-like) reverst behind: Heads of this sort in and about the City There are a multitude, the mores the pitty. 20 A Smooth-head is his Daddies dainty boy, His mother cals him still her onely joy, His amiable countenance is clad With many seeming vertues; nothing bad: This Smooth-head hath an oylely tongue likewise, Can sooth, and gloze, and monstrous thiugs devise. 21 A Rugged-head is like a craggie mountaine, Whence churlishnesse proceeds as from a fountaine, This rugged, crooked, crabbed, ill made mazzard Is obstinate, cares not for any hazzard. A world of follies this head liveth in, But yet presumption is his greatest sin. 22 A Loger-head alone cannot well be, At Scriveners windowes many times hangs three. A Country Lobcocke, as I once did heare, Upon a Pen-man put a grievous jeare; If I had beene in place, as this man was, I should have calld that Country-Coxecombe Asse. 23 A Narrow head is one whose braines are couched, Into a little roome, may not be touched, With any Beere or Ale, or Wine, or Water, For then his wits forthwith abroad will scatter, He is a silly simple, puling foole, Knowes not the name of Learning, nor a Schole. 24 A Broade head (if on broader shoulders placed) Thinkes not himselfe by any jeares disgraced, Scoffe, scorne, and flout him, so you picks not's Purse, This head conceiveth he is nere the worse, It were a sin to call him Cuckold thoe, Because he doth beleeve he is not soe. 25 A Blocke-head (to make his assertion good) Is not so calld, because 'tis made of wood, This head consisteth not of many parts, Nor is it capable to learne the Arts, Yet give me leave, now I doe all things scan, This head in time may serve an honest man. 26 A light head is full fraughgt with pleasant Ayre, Thinks well of every one thats speaks him faire, Hee's given to leaping, much, and much to dauncing, Curverting, jumpiug, vaulting and prauncing, This nimble head whose father was no fumbler. May make a Dancer on the ropcs, or Tumbler. 27 A Heavy head is naught for complement, So full it is of griefe and discontent, The pensive thoughts that this head doth conceive, May make the best man all his meat to leave, He that is full of trouble, paine and sorrow, May see his dinner drest, but eate to morrow. The Conclusion. A world of heads more I could name to you, An Hogs head, Pigs head, and a Calves head too, A Jowle of Salmon too, is halfe a head, Which any man may well disgest with bread, And next unto this Jowle of Salmon fish, A Swines Cheek is esteem'd an ex'lent dish: An Oxe cheek likewise is a dish of meat Which many an old, yonger, wived man may eate. These heads and halfe-heads all are known for food, And I doe hold them to be very good: There also is a Sheeps head and an Asses, But this last head most of the rest surpasses, For this in time by friends and loves increase, May be chiefe Clarke t'a Justice of Peace. But stay rash Muse, why dost thou so farre flie, Thou must not meddle with Authoritie. FINIS. MAD VERSE, SAD VERSE, GLAD Verse and Bad Verse. I weeping sing the maddest mad Rebellion, That ever Story told, or Tongue can tell ye on: The Barbarous Wars of th'Heathen Gothes, and Vandalls, Did never make their names such Odious Scandalls: The Turkes, the Jewes, the Canniballs and Tartars, Ne're kept such wicked, Rude, unruly Quarters. Jerusalems Eleazer, John and Simon, Did ne're yeeld Poet baser stuffe to Rime on. Not bloody Sylla, or consuming Marius, Into so many mischiefes could e're carry us; The Roman and th'Imperiall Guelphes and Gibellins, Vnto our English Rebells are but Quiblins. Not Munsters John a Leyd, or Knipperdoling, Did ever use such Pilling and such Poleing; Nor was their Cheating or their Hare-braind trouble like As ours, (rais'd by the faithlesse Faith call'd Publique.) The Royall twain, Lancastrians, and Yorkists, Were ne're so mad as those Cornuted Forkists. The Heard of all the Councell (called Common) Hath shewed such wisedome, as was seen by no man; And many of the Rich and Reverend Aldermen, (Saving their Beards) in wit were never Balder-men. The Citazens of all Trades, (poor tame Widgeons) Were hardly more in number, then Religions, That one may say of London, what a Towne ist, Is it quite Metamorphos'd and turn'd Brownist, Or shivered into Sects? alas, how apt ist To be a Familist, or Anabaptist! And last of all, (and which of all the worst is) To be Rebellious, which (of all) accurst is. The two pretended Houses at Westminster Have made a stirre, as there hath never bin stirre To equall it, and with Religious Mantle They Rifle England, by patch, piece and Cantle. The Documents of Burton, Prinne and Bastwick Inspires the People mindes, and Braines fantastick, Whilst the Committee close, or close Committee Makes many Thousands sing a dolefull Dittie; Where daily feares are stamp'd and new Coynd Jealousies For King and Kingdomes spoyle, both Fire and Bellowes is. Their Whirlegigges, their Vanes and Haslerigges, Whose wisedomes are approv'd, (like Tarletons Jygges.) Mild-may that monster never be received, That Judas like his Maisters trust deceived, And let that Pye within the Oven be burned, That 'gainst his Maker is a Rebell turned. Let Say be lesse esteem'd then rotten Buckram And Holland scorn'd and stink like lousie Lockram May Deering, a rare Gem, a deare Ring be he, And (Circle) turn'd, at the Triangle Tree be. And I may say of thee, O London, London, What hath thy sword and shield, thy Pike and Gun done, O what hath many a Mothers wicked son done But made their Magazen of mischiefe London, Thrice happy had it been for our Tranquillitie, If th'Authors of this damned Incivilitie, Had been a little checkt by Gregory Brandon, With every one a Hempen twisted Band on. Because I wrote some Pamphlets, that were printed In hope thereby their madnesse might be stinted, For which my kindnesse they were still ingratefull, And every day (with troubles) fild my Pate full, Abusing my sincere and good Intentions With foule prejudicate and false Inventions. For since the time that first I understood men I ne're writ any thing to anger good men; But I have lasht at Nose-wife Scripture Picklers, At Separatists and lawlesse Conventicklers, Who are this Kingdomes wasting Maledictions, The Kings, the Churches, and the Lands Afflictions. They said I was a Villaine, and most fervent In Roguery, for I was the Kings sworne Servant: They did so farre detest me, and abhorre me They caused a Messenger to be sent for me, He used me kindly for which cause here I name The man (a wonder) and men call him Binehame. He said mine Enemies were full of malice (Wider from truth then Dover is from Callice;) Their fowle Complaints (quoth he) are scimble scamble, Mere Froth and Vapour, yet we two must amble Before the close Committees great Tribunall, (Whose Orders have put Order out of Tune all.) To Merchant-Taylors-Hall, (as I remember) He brought me, neare the ending of November, The yeare of sixteene hundred forty and two Whereas false Accusations I did stand to, Æthiopian Corbet, Isaack high and mighty Look'd grim, their very countenance would fright ye, They charg'd me with such words, that I had spoken Which had I spoke, my Neck they would have broken; That Pym, Kimbolton, Haslerigge, Strode, Hampden And Hollis (Rebells which the learned Campden, Nor Stow, Howes, Speed, old Fabian, Cooper, Grafton In all their Chronicles, they never left one For Treason, with those six to be compared, Or dar'd to do, the like as they have dared.) They said I said, those six a cursed Crew were, That they to God, King, Kingdom, never true were, That they were Rogues, and Theeves, full of oppression, Rebells, and Traitors, for which foul Transgression Because they all grew rich by Robbing others, Made Sirelesse Sons, Sons Sirelesse, Sonlesse Mothers, By Rapine bringing Thousands unto Beggery, For which they all deserv'd reward from Gregory. These dangerous accusations I deny'd all, My conscience knew, that they from Truth were wide all, And that my accusers, that sought my disgrace there, Not one of them did dare to show his face there. Vpon which answer they did straight acquit me, Yet to the Messenger they did Commit me; But he spake for me, I did humbly wooe them: He said (at any time) I should come to them: The honest Messenger gat me discharged, And to the Tavern we went both enlarged, Where I did give him thanks in Sack and Claret, And for his paines had but a small fee for it. My Rascall Enemies did dayly watch me, And vow'd to do me mischiefe if they catch me: To Murder me, they many times way-laid me, And near the Guild-Hall once had like t'have payd me. For as my selfe, and two more honest men was, One Quart at three-tons Tavern, drinking then was, The cursed Crew, (more then six score to'th hundred) Did swear that Limb from Limb I should be sundred) My friends and I Amaz'd, did much admire on, Wherefore the House so Rudely they Inviron, But I perceiving t'was no time to dally, Slipt through a smoke shop in t'a narrow Alley, And so into a street men call Cat-Eaten, And by that meanes, scap'd more then being Beaten, My Wife lay long sick, many troubles prickt me, Necessity did divers wayes Afflict me. The King (my Maister) justly was offended, And on his Service my Estate depended, He, and His Royall Queen, (my gracious Mistris) Were driven from us, His Servants left in distresse; Where we (poor fellows) were despis'd and hated, And to give Money 'gainst our Maister Rated: But I, with others, crav'd to be excused, Some gave, some gave not, flatly I refused, My King and's Father, gave me cloath and Wages, Which Motive sure His Servants all ingages: But too too many a Rascall (worse then Judas,) Have given the Rebells Money like a Lewd Asse. The generation of abhorred Vipers, The Coyn Collectors, most insatiate Gripers, Swore to return my name, I feard what may come, And left my wife a dying, and away come. My wrongs, my griefes, and sicknesse so had wearied her, Shee dy'd, they sold my goods, and fairly buried her. Th'usurping Fsaack (Major) did hate me deadly, But yet I got his passe (by meere Chaunce-Medly;) I tooke a Boate, and up to Windsor went I, Whereas of Rebells (of all sorts) were plenty, Some great Commanders, who were Tradesmen broaken Grown rich with Plunder, late, scarse worth a Token; Some Cobling Preachers, some perfidious Nobles, (The Church, the King and Kingdomes cursed troubles) Besides a crew of base Knaves, Omnium Gatherum, Shuffle 'em together, and the Divell father 'um; One of their Generall Essex Life-Guard was there Who struck me, as I up the street did passe there, He calld me pretty surnames, Rogue and Traytor, Malignant, and the Parliaments great hater, And Spy, and to the Kings use then that I would Betray the Town and Castle both, if I could. That villaine had a mighty mind to bast me, But I, from him did to the Castle hast me, Where Peterboroughs Earle, and the Lord Rochfort, (Pardon my Rime good Reader I must botch for't) They knew me, and did entertaine me friendly And askt at what place did my journies end lye, I said to Abingdon, and that to Henly I would go that night, if I might passe cleanly, Or safely from my Lord of Essex Catives Whose carriage shewed, they were not Englands Natives. The Noble Rebells kindly did discard me And caused some Souldiers through their Guards to guard me, And so I Windsor left, (what can be more said) And weary went to Henly, as aforesaid, But when to Maidenhead I was advanced, Vpon three Ragged Rebells there I chanced, Who all to Henly, company did beare me And in the mid-way, (in a wood) did feare me. For, in the Thicket of tall Oakes and Beeches Me thought I heard 'em mutter scurvy speeches, One said, old man, the Coat you now are wearing Is much too hot, and heavy for your bearing, The second spide a bag, wherein I carried Things for my use, (as my occasions varied) These two demanded, and I durst not grudge it But strait delivered them my Coat and Budget. The third man (which did make their number triple) Offered his service, like a kind disciple, Quoth he, of that man you to much have shar'd him, And of his goods and moveables have par'd him, Shall I that of your Company am third man Have nothing, shall I be a base absurd man. My friend, quoth I, all is not quite berest me My selfe is yet mine owne, my selfe is left me, I'm weary, carry me, they have my cloothing And thou shalt carry me, that's more then nothing. With that they laught outright, I faining smiled And so the tedious way with talke beguiled. My leash of Rascalls, were mad Blades, (right Bilboes) True tatter'd Rogues, in breech, shirts, skirts and elboes, They sung, and danc'd the Morris, like maide Marrian And sweat and stunk, as sweet as sugar Carrion, I mus'd, if they were pleas'd to jeere and sob me, Or if they meant to jest with me or Rob me: But they to me prov'd Rebells with some reason They had not learn'd their Grammar Rules of Treason, They kindly brought me to a wholsome Alehouse, Where merrily we drank like foure good fellowes, With songs, and tales, and now and then a story And 'ere we fell a sleep, we sung John Dorrye, They gave me all, which they from me had got then; Deceiving me, cause they deceiv'd me not then; I left both them and Henly, and away I To Abingdon, by shutting in of day I Came to the Kings Head, (my owne Brother's house,) and Of welcomes, I had some part of a thousand. 'Twas neare the time of Marches Equinoctiall, J had good meat, and such drink as would fox ye all; Ther's many Barrell full, turn'd Turvey Topsie And many a But hath dropt away the dropsie That there's good fare, and entertainment proper For Love, for Gold, for Silver, and for Copper. At Abingdon, I staid almost a fortnight, The dayes wax'd long, (and each day had a short night.) Much about Easter time, I came to Oxford, Where are some few knaves, and some Mizers Fox-furd, In Christ-Church Garden, then a gladsome sight was My Soveraigne Lord, and many a Peere and Knight was, The Hopefull Prince and James Dux Eboracensis (Whom God defend from Rebells false pretences) The Sunne of Sacred Majesty did frustrate My former griefes, and all my joyes Illustrate, His gracious Eye, did see where I did stand strait, He came to me, puts forth his Royall hand strait, Which on my knees, I humbly kneeld and kist it, I rather had left all I had, then mist it. But now at Oxford, I was safe arrived, How to be well imployed my Braines contrived, My purse was turn'd a Brownist or a Round-head, For all the Crosses in it, were confounded, To some Imployment I my selfe must settle, Fire must be had to boyle the Pot and Kettle. Then by the Lords Commissioners, and also By my good King, (whom all true Subjects call so) I was commanded with the Water Baylie To see the Rivers clensed both nights and dayly. Dead Hogges, Dogges, Cats, and well slayd Carryon Horses Their noysom Corpes soyld the Waters Courses: Both swines and Stable dunge, Beasts guts and Garbage, Street durt, with Gardners weeds and Rotten Herbage. And from those Waters filthy putrifaction, Our meat and drink were made, which bred Infection. My selfe and partner, with cost paines and travell, Saw all made clean, from Carryon, Mud, and Gravell: And now and then was punisht a Delinquent, By which good meanes away the filth and stink went. Besides at all commands, we serv'd all warrants, To take Boats for most necessary errants, To carry Ammunition, food and fewell, (The last of which last Winter was a Jewell.) Poor Souldiers that were Maim'd, or sick, or wounded By the curst meanes of some Rebellious Roundhead; To carry and recarry them our care was, To get them Boats as cause both here and there was. Thus have I been imployd, besides my trade is, To write some Pamphlets, to please Lords and Ladies, With Gentlemen or others that will read them, Whose wits (I hope) not over much will heed them. To all these services I am immediate Obedient, willing, at occasions ready at. My Riches is my Lame Legge, let the blame lye Vpon that Legge, because I have writ Lamelye. FINIS. REBELLS Anathematized, And Anatomized: OR, A Satyricall Salutation to the Rabble of seditious, pestiferous Pulpit-praters, with their Brethren the Weekly Libellers, Railers, and Revilers, Mercurius Britannicus, with the rest of that Sathanicall Fraternity. Lo, I the Man, whose stout impartiall quill Dares venture to confront the damned Crew, Knaves who make will their law, and law their will, And from the Presse and Pulpit slanders spew; Such as with seven great Devils are possest, Besides of small ones (Legions infinite) Whose fiery Furies doth our Peace molest, And to disturbe us, fight, back-bite, and write. First, Lucifer inspires 'em all with Pride, Next, Sathan gives 'em wrath and dire disdain; Their malice still Belzebubs power doth guide, And Mammon gives 'em thirst of lawlesse gain; Belphegor is the god of Gluttony, And Abaddon rules Sloth and Idlenesse, Last, Asmodeus gives 'em Lechery. And these seven Devils the Rebells do possesse, And these have made them mad, and madly rise Against the Lord of Hosts, and his Anointed, Who by their Preaching and their printed Lyes, Our Church, Lawes, States, and Freedomes have disjointed: Wither that dainty Darling of the Dolts, The Scout, the Scotish Dove, and the Diurnall, These (like to Gothams Archers) shoot their bolts, And madly strive the Truth to overturne all; Bold Booker soares above the nineteenth spheare, And tells us newes of strange prodigious Comets, Portending Treasons, all which once a yeare Most Astrologicall he squirts and vomits. The Scribe that writes the Weekes Intelligence Th'Occurrents, and the flying lying Poste, To do 'em service Ile be at expence T'allow them every day a Gravesend Toast. These with the Cobling, Tub, pernicious Preachers, With Prinne and Burton (sweet-fac'd crop-'ear'd Curres) These Parliamentall props these Treason Teachers, Have in three Kingdomes kept most stinking stirres: Therefore yee misled Coxcombs all take heed, Believe no more those cursed sonnes of Belial, Their damned Cousels makes poore England bleed, And doth from God and your Alleageance steale yee all; Outragious Mars hath stolne Astreas sword, And wrong (with down-right blowes) hath knock'd right down, Whilest universally it is deplor'd, That no man can (with justice) own his own. Mean men to men of meanes you up have mounted, And men of meanes you have to mean men turn'd, The worst of Villaines you have best accounted, God's peace, the King's, and Kingdomes yee have scorn'd; London and Westminster ye'ave been the Chaire Of violence, t'Act mischiefes (by a Law) Prepare your selves, expect the dismall yeare, Which you or your forefathers never saw. The time will come when all these royall graces, And peacefull offers which you scorn'd and slighted, You shall be glad to beg for, and your faces Full of confusion, pittilesse, despighted: Your Propositions, (Puppy-sitions rather) Which you to Oxford sawcily did bring, And after that to Uxbridge, men may gather Your meanings to the Kingdome, Church, and King. You knew before you came, your bold demands Unfit for you to aske, or any subjects, As for a King to grant, that understands Himselfe or loyall Servants, from base Abjects. Your Parliament (pretended) coynes pretences, And to pretend Peace you are still resolv'd, And still run on in treacherous offences, Wherein our miseries are all involv'd. Worse than the Jewes, God's Houses you defile Worse than the Heathen, you your King contemn'd Worse than the Turkes, you Morall good exile Worse than the Sodomites, you friends condemn'd, Worse than the Atheists, you no God will know, Worse than the Libertines, Lawes down you trample, Worse than the Wolves, that can no mercy shew, Worse than the Devill himselfe, (beyond example) Pliny, and Gesner, and brave Mandevill, Have wrote of Monsters, and their salvage natures; But never tongue of man or writers quill Could parallel you for most impious Creatures; Your bloudy lives makes Neroes life no sin Your faithlesse zeale makes Julian just and holy, Your loyalties like Roman Cataline; Beyond their Crimes all Ages shall extoll yee: You to more cursed cruelty are turn'd Than Idumean, Jew, Turke, Heathen, Roman, If the Sword spare you, youle be hang'd or burn'd, Or sterv'd, or die abhorr'd, pitied by no man. You have been hatching Plots foure yeares and more, Contriving and suborning Forgeries, T'abuse the King, and yet will not give o're To scandall him with Libells and with Lyes. True Parliaments have held the names of Kings Of sacred Dignity, and high esteem, Next under God, above all earthly things, Their Royalties and Honours they did deem; And in this case, and all that you have done You have declar'd your selves no Parliament; King, Church, and Kingdome, you have all undone, Or sought their ruine, or their detriment. He were a cunning wise-man that could name One good man, that hath scap'd your tyranny; Or one whose braine, or hands could mischiefe frame, Whom you have not advanc'd for villany. That poyson-framing Hownd Britannicus, That weekly snarling whelpe of Cerberus, That Microcosme of Morbus Gallicus, That Lernean venom'd Snake of Erebus. The Devill oft doth good, against his will, So you and he doth, for your damn'd despight Proves the King's good, although you wish him ill, And makes his royall splendour shine more bright. Thus you may see, you Impes of impudence, You mighty Gogmagogs of ignorance, You Gulphes of most ridiculous non-sence, You super-arrogating arrogance, You cannot do the wickednesse yee would, But on your cursed heads it doth returne; The Devill that teacheth to blaspheme and scold, Cannot protect you from contempt and scorne. Since God's eternall Son was crucifide, No Gracious Prince was ever more abus'd, Than good King Charles, oppos'd and vilifide, Robb'd, ransack'd, and still wickedly traduc'd. And your almighty favours are extended To those that could revile most, or do worst; And by usurped power you have defended And arm'd Rebellion, which God hath accurst. A Parliament should cure a Kingdomes griefes, A Parliament should publique wrongs appease; But you in stead of giving us reliefes, Have made the med'cine worse than the disease, Worse, ten times worse, ten times worse double told, The worst of ills, more bad than bad can be, Our miseries unmeasur'd manifold, And to three Kingdomes spoile you all agree. Upon great Strafford first your fury fell, His blood must temper your untemper'd morter, His head did hinder, you could not rebell To any purpose till he was cut shorter. Nor could you Protestant Religion cast, Or with such ease worke its confusion further, Untill the tenth of January last, You took an Arch-prop from it by foule murther. That Function whereof the Apostles were, Saint Peter and Saint James, and more of them, Records Ecclesiasticall shewes cleare Of Sees of Antioch, and Jerusalem. And blest Saint Paul, made Bishops, (as 'twas meet) The one young Timothy, the other Titus; The one of Ephesus, th'other of Crete, Who by their lives and Doctrines do enlight us, And since for sixteen hundred yeares and more, And Christian Churches, Kingdomes, Lands, and Climates Have been instructed in God's Lawes and lore By Reverend Bishops, Patriarchs, and Primates. Therefore if men would note the aime and scope Of these superbian haughty Independants, Each one would in his Parish be a Pope To whose pipes must the King and all his men dance. Therefore beware, good countrimen beware, Beware of them, and of a new Presbytery, Beware their Leaven, have especiall care, Let not their mad-brain'd Doctrine all besquitter yee. They seem t'uphold the Protestants good Cause, By murdering those of that Religion chiefe, Bereaving all that Clergy, without Lawes, Of life, goods, libertty, and all riliefe. They feigne to purge Religion sound and sure, By bloody Civill Warre, which will destroy it; And they will keep it neat, sincere, and pure, So noysome as may totally annoy it. Blinde with rebellious or prepostrous zeale You have possest men with most strange opinions, That Churches ruine is the Churches weale; And make the King great, (but without dominions) He is your Soveraigne for your safe protection, And you (like Subjects) will obey and serve him, Yet you no service owe him, or subjection, And do the worst you can to rob or sterve him. Strife cannot be the ground of true Religion, Your Sects, worse than the Alcaron, or Talmud, (Like Mah'mets zeale from's jugling whispring Pigeon) Not from the Scriptures Chrystall Fount but all mud. What hath the Kirke of Scotland here to doe? Must Englands Church to that be now subjected? We are not conquer'd, or made slaves I troe; Or so unlearn'd, by them to be directed. Our Church with theirs doth neither meddle nor make, Our Lawes to alter theirs do not intrude; Why then do they presumptuous power thus take, And censure us, as they had us subdude? Must Oxford and her sister Cambridge both Learne of Saint Andrews and of Aberdene? They to be taught of us would both be loath, Yet I am sure there is some ods between. Let Englishmen remember what they are; And call to minde, but what they erst have been, And what they must be, if they not prepare, To shun the mischiefes they are compass'd in, You see that our Religion and our Law Our foes would ruinate both root and branch, And captivate us with a slavish awe, Or with our blouds their bloudy thirst would staunch. Upon the Crown, the Royall Paire and Race, Upon the Peeres, the Clergy, Church, and Gentry, Without respect of Person, Time, or Place, To spoile all, they have made a sawcy entry. Yet of that noble Northern Nation are Thousands and thousands to their Soveraigne true, And such as are not, Let consuming Warre Confound 'em or the Hangman claime his due. And now you Pulpiteers, and Pamphleterians, I take my leave in you own friendly manner; And you most high and mighty Westminsterians, Who have (too long) displaid rebellions Banner, For your blacke deeds, Heavens vengeance lies in store For Bourchier, Yeomans, Tomkins, Challoner, For Lords, Knights, Gentry, Commons, thousands more, Whom you have murdered by intestine Warre. The worme of conscience shall consume you lives, Hell and damnation shall be your just hire. Your children shall be miscreants, your wives Begger'd, except Repentance swage God's ire, Which that it may do, I most humbly pray, And let our fervent prayers to Heaven ascend. That you may turne, before the last of May. That Englands miseries may have an— END THE EXALE-TATION OF ALE The ancient Liquor of this REALME OR, A Cleare Definition of its Efficatious operation in severall Pates, Arts, and Professions. Not drunken nor sober, but neighbour to both, I met with a friend in Ales-bury Vale; He saw by my face, that I was in the case To speak no great harm of a Pot of good Ale. Then did he me greet, and sayd since we meet, (And he put me in minde of the name of the Dale) For Ales-bury's sake, some paines I would take, And not bury the praise of a Pot of good Ale. The more to procure me, then he did adjure me, If the Ale I dranke last were nappy and stale, To do it its right, and stir up my spri'te, And fall to commend a &amp;c. Quoth I, To commend it I dare not begin, Lest therein my credit might happen to fail; For many men now doe count it a sin, But once to looke toward a &amp;c. Yet I care not a pin, for I see no such sin, Nor any thing else my courage to quail: For this we do finde, that take it in kinde, Much Virtue there is in a &amp;c. And I meane not the taste, though thereby much grac't, Nor the Merry-go-down without pull or hale, Perfuming the throat when the stomack's aflote, With the fragrant sweet scent of a &amp;c. Nor yet the delight that comes to the sight, To see how it flowers and mantles in graile, As green as a Leek, with a smile in the cheek, The true orient colour of a &amp;c. But I meane the Mind, and the good it doth find; Not onely the Body so feeble and fraile: For Body and Soule may blesse the Black bowle, Since both are beholden to a &amp;c. For when heavinesse the mind doth oppresse, And sorrow and griefe the heart do assaile, No remedy quicker, than to take off your Liquor, And to wash away Cares with a &amp;c. The Widdow that buried her husband of late Will soone have forgotten to weep and to waile, And think every day twain, till she marry again, If she read the Contents of a &amp;c. It is like a belly-blast to a Cold heart, And warms and ingenders the spirits vitall, To keep them from domage, all sp'rites owe their homage To the Sp'rite of the Buttery a &amp;c. And down to the legs the virtue doth goe, And to a bad Foot-man is as good as a saile, When it fills the veins and makes light the brains, No Lackey so nimble as a &amp;c. The Naked complains not for want of a Coat, Nor on the cold weather will once turne his taile; All the way as he goes, he cuts the wind with his nose, If he be but well wrapt in a &amp;c. The hungry man takes no thought for his meat, Though his stomack would brook a ten-penny naile; He quite forgets hunger, thinks on it no longer, If he touch but the sparks of a &amp;c. The Poor man will praise it, so hath he good cause, That all the yeare eats neither partridge nor quaile, But sets up his rest, and makes up his feast With a crust of brown bread and a &amp;c. The Shepherd, the Sower, the Thresher, the Mower, The one with his scyth, the other with his flail, Take them out by the poll, on the peril of my soul, All will hold up their hands to a &amp;c. The Soldier, the Saylor, the True-man, the Tayler, The Lawyer that Sels words by weight and by tale; Take 'em all as they are, from the War to the Bar, They all will approve of a &amp;c. All Religions and Nations, all Countreys and fashions, Rich or poore, Knave or Whore, dwarfish or tall, High or low, this I know, all will bow, Ile avow, To the high power of a &amp;c. The Sallamander, Brazier that baths in the fire, Whilst his Bellowes are blowing a blustering gale, Will shake off his full Kan, and sweare each true Vulcan Will hazard his wits for a &amp;c. The Black-smith, whose bellowes all summer do blow, With the fire in his face still, without e're a Vaile, Though his throat be full dry, he will tell you no lye, But where you may be sure of a &amp;c. Who ever denies it, the Prisoners will praise it, That beg at the Grate, and ly in the Goale: For, even in their Fetters, they thinke themselves better May they get but a two penny black pot of Ale. For though they be inclos'd in the Grate, They'le sing and be merry, and care for no Bale; Nor for hunger, for cold, for fetters or fate, The Comfort consists in a &amp;c. The Begger whose portion is alwayes his prayers, Not having a tatter to hang on his taile, Is as rich in his rags, as the churle in his bags, If he once but shakes hands with a &amp;c. It drives his poverty cleane out of minde, Forgeting his brown-bread, his wallet, and maile, He walks in the house like a six-footed lowse, If he once be enricht with a &amp;c. And he that doth dig in the ditches all day, And wearies himselfe quite at the Plough-taile, Will speak no lesse things, than of Queens and of Kings, If he touch but the top of a &amp;c. 'Tis like a whetstone to a blunt wit, And makes a supply where Nature doth faile: The dullest wit soon will look quite through the Moon, If his temples be wet with a &amp;c. Then DICK to his Dearling, full boldly dares speak, Though before (silly fellow) his courage did quaile, He gives her the smouch, with his hand on his pouch, If he meet by the way with a &amp;c. And it make the Carter a Courtier straightway; With Rhetoricall terms he will tell his tale; With Courtesies great store, and his Cap up before Being school'd but a little with a &amp;c. The Old man, whose tongue wags faster than his teeth, (For old-age by nature doth drivel and drale) Will frig and will fling, like a dog in a string, If he warme his cold bloud with a &amp;c. And the good Old Clark, whose sight waxeth dark, And ever he thinks the Print is too small: He will see every Letter, and say Service better, If he glaze but his eyes with a &amp;c. The Cheeks and the Jawes, to commend it hath cause, For where they were late but even wan and pale: They will get them a colour, no Crimson is fuller, By the true dy and tincture of a &amp;c. Mark her enemies, though they think themselves wise, How meager they look, with how low a wail: How their cheeks do fall, without spirits at all, That alien their minds from a &amp;c. And now that the grains do work in my brains, Me thinks I were able to give by retaile, Commodities store, a dozen and more, That flow to mankind from a &amp;c. The MUSES would muse, any should it misuse; For, it makes them to sing like a Nightingale, With a lofty trim note, having washed their throat, With the Caballine Spring of a &amp;c. And the Musician of any condition, It will make him reach to the top of his Scale: It will clear his pipes, and moisten his lights, If he drink alternatim a &amp;c. The Poet divine, that cannot reach wine, Because that his mony doth many times fail; Will hit on the Vein, to make a good strein, If he be but inspired with a &amp;c. For Ballads ELDERTON never had Peer, How went his wit in them, with how merry a gale: And with all the sails up, had he been at the cup, And washed his beard with a &amp;c. All Writers or Rimers, for such whose mishap, Is from Newgate up Houlbourn, to Tyburn to sail; Shall have suddain expression of all their confession, If the Muse be but dew'd with a &amp;c. And the power of it shows, no whit lesse in Prose, It will file one's Phrase, and set forth his tale: Fill him but a Boul, it will make his tongue troul, For flowing speech flows from a &amp;c. And Master Philosopher, if he drink his part, Will not trifle his time in the Husk or the Shale; But go to the Kernell by the depth of his Art, To be found in the bottom of a &amp;c. Give a Scholar of OXFORD a pot of Sixteens, And put him to prove that an Ape hath a tail: And sixteen times better his Wit will be seen, If you fetch him from Botley, a &amp;c. Thus it helps Speech and Wit; And it hurts not a whit, But rather doth further the Virtues morale: Then think it not much, if a little I touch The good moral parts of a &amp;c. To the Church and Religion it is a good friend, Or else our Forefathers their wisdome did faile, That at every mile, next to the Church stile, Set a consecrate house to a &amp;c. But now as they say, Beer beares it away; The more is the pity, if Right might prevaile: For with this same Beer, came up Heresie here; The old Catholique Drink is a &amp;c. This Beer's but an upstart from Dutchland here come, Whose Credit with us sometimes is but small: For in the Records of the Empire of Rome, The old Catholique Drink is a &amp;c. O! the ancient tales that my Grandam hath told, How merry we have been in Parlour and Hall; How in Christmas time, we would dance, sing, and rime, As if we were mad with a &amp;c. The Churches much owe, as we all do know; For when they be drooping and ready to fall, By a Whitson or Church-Ale, up again they shall goe, And owe their repairing to a &amp;c. Truth will do it right, it brings Truth to light, And many bad matters it helps to reveile; For, they that will drinke, will speak what they think; TOM tell-troate lies hid in a &amp;c. It is Justices friend, she will it commend: For, all is here served by measure and tale: Now true-tale and good measure are Justices treasure And much to the praise of a &amp;c. And next I alledge, it is Fortitudes edge: For a very Cow-herd, that shrinks like a Snaile, Will swear and will swagger, and out goes his dagger, If he be but arm'd with a &amp;c. Yea, ALE hath her Knights and Squires of degree, That never wore Corslet, nor yet shirt of Mail, But have fought their fights all, 'twixt the pot and the wall, When once they were dubb'd with a &amp;c. And (sure) it will make a man suddenly wise, Er'e-while was scarce able to tell a right tale: It will open his jaw, he will tell you the Law, As made a right-Bencher of a &amp;c. Or he that will make a bargain to gaine, In buying or setting his goods forth to sale Must not plod in the mire, but sit by the fire, And seal up his Match with a &amp;c. But for Sobernesse needs must I confesse, The matter goes hard: and few doe prevaile Not to goe too deep, but temper to keep, Such is the Attractive of a &amp;c. But here's an amends, which will make all friends, And ever doth tend to the best avail; If you take it too deep, it will make you but sleep; So comes no great harm of a &amp;c. If (reeling) they happen to fall to the ground, The fall is not great they may hold by the Raile: If into the water, they cannot be drown'd, For that gift is given to a &amp;c. If drinking about they chance to fall out, Feare not the Alarm, though flesh be but frail, It will prove but some blows, or at most a bloudy nose, And friends again streight with a &amp;c. And Physick will favour ALE, as it is bound, And be against Beer both tooth and nail: They send up and down all over the Town, To get for their Patients a &amp;c. Their Ale-berries, Cawdles, and Possets each one, And Sillabubs made at the milking-pale, Although they be many, Beer comes not in any, But all are compos'd with a &amp;c. And in very deed, the Hop's but a weed, Brought o're against Law, and here set to sale: Would the Law were renew'd, and no more Beer brew'd, But all good men partake them to a &amp;c. The Law that will take it under her wing: For at every Law-day, or Moot of the hale, One is sworn to serve our Soveraign the KING, In the ancient Office of a CONNER of ALE. There's never a Lord of Mannor or of Town, By strand or by land, by hill or by dale, But thinks it a Franchise, and a Flowr of the CROWN, To hold the Assize of a &amp;c. And though there ly writs, from the Courts Paramo?t, To stay the proceedings of the Cours Paravaile; Law favours it so, you may come, you may go, There lies no Prohibition to a &amp;c. They talk much of State, both early and late, But if Gascoign and Spain, their Wine should but fail, No remedy then, with us Englishmen, But the State it must stand by a &amp;c. And they that sit by it, are good men and quiet, No dangerous Plotters in the Common-weal Of Treason and Murther: for, they never go further, Than to call for, and pay for a &amp;c. To the praise of CAMBRIVIUS that good Brittish King That devised for his Nation (by the Welshmens tale) Seventeen hundred years before CHRIST did spring, The happy invention of a &amp;c. But he was a Paynim, and ALE then was rife, Yet after CHRIST came and bid us all hail, Saint DAVID tid never trink Peer in her life, But all Cwwrwwhibley a &amp;c. The North they will prayse it, and prayse it with passion, Where every River gives name to a Dale: There men are yet living, that are of th'old fashion, No Nectar they know but a &amp;c. The PICTS and the SCOTS, for ALE, were at lots, So high was the skill, and so kept under seal: The PICTS were undone, slain each mothers son, For not teaching the SCOTS to make Hether Eale. But hither or thither, it skils not much whether: For drink must be had, men live not by Keal, Nor by Havor-bannocks, nor by Havor-jannocks, The thing that SCOTS live on is a &amp;c. Now, if you will say it, I will not denay it, That many a man it brings to his bale: Yet what fairer end, can one wish to his friend, Than to die by the dart of a &amp;c. Yet, let not the innocent beare any blame, It is their own doings to break o're the pale: And neither the Mault nor the good Wife in fault, If any be potted with a &amp;c. They tell whom it kills, but say not a word, How many a man liveth both sound and hale, Though he drink no beer any day in the yeare, By the Radicall humour of a &amp;c. But, to speak of Killing, that am I not willing, For that, in a manner, were but to raile: But Beer hath his name, cause it brings to the Buyer; Therefore well-fare say I to a &amp;c. Too many (I wis) with their deaths proved this; And wherefore if ancient Records do not faile) He that first brew'd the Hop, was rewarded with a rope, And found his Beer far more bitter then ALE. O ALE ab alendo thou Liquor of LIFE! That I had but a mouth as big as a Whale! For mine is too little to touch the least tittle That belongs to the prayse of a &amp;c. Thus (I trow) some Vertues I have marked you out, And never a Vice in all this long traile, But that after the Pot there commeth a Shot, And thats th'only blot of a &amp;c. With that my friend said: That Blot will I bear, You have done very well, it is time to strike saile; Wee'l have six pots more, though I die on the score, To make all this good of a Pot of good ALE. FINIS. EPIGRAMMES, Written on purpose to be read: WITH A PROVISO, That they may be understood by the READER; Being Ninety in Number: Besides, two new made Satyres that attend them. [1.] To the good or bad Reader. Read well, and then these following lines are mine, But read them like a (Botcher) they are thine. Such vertue from some Readers doth proceed, They make the Verse the better which they read: They know their Idioms, Accents, Emphases, Comma's, Stops, Colons, and Parenthesis, Full Points, and Periods, briefe Apostraphes; Good knowing Readers understand all these: But such as dares my Booke to take in hand, Who scarce can read, or spell, or understand; Yet (like Sir reverence Geese) they will be gagling, And teare my Lines to tatters with their hagling; Such I request (if Batchelours they bee) To leave my Book, and learn their A, B, C: If married men they be, let them take paine, To exercise their Horn-books once againe. 2. Of friends. Hee's happy that hath friends at need (I wot) Hee's happier that hath friends, and needs them not. 3. Unity, Enmity, Amity. Our Unity is turn'd to Enmity, And Enmity hath banish'd Amity. 4. Of Credit. Ralph deepe in Debt, curst Creditors and Credit, And seemes to shew some reasons why he did it: 'Twas Credit made his Creditors to trust him, Sans Credit, into jayle they had not thrust him. 5. Honest Jone. Jone is a perfect Mayd, who dares gainsay it, No Faults I in her Honesty can see; Her carriage dares bide touch and test, but weigh it, No honesty amongst her Faults can bee. 6. Teeth and Hornes. Teeth breeding and Tooth-aking is most painfull, But Wittalls breeding Horns, hath oft been gainfull. 7. Of Seales and Armes. Eagles and Lyons, Kings of Birds and Beasts, Adorne mens Seales and Armes with honour'd Crests: But Beasts are Beasts, and fairest Fowles are Fowle, And many a Knaves Seale's better then his Soule. 8. Thrifty preaching. He that will preach for Wealth and Dignity Must Simon Peters Doctrine quite refuse: 'Tis Simon Magus, his Hypocrisie Mounts such as cunningly their craft can use. 9. Devout Margery. My sister Margery is sins Correcter, Of purest sisters thread she'le spin a Lecture: She'le stand and preach as long as she can stir, It is not standing long can trouble her. 10. Things done by neither wise men or fooles. Wise men will not do as Great men have done, And Fooles cannot into such madnesse run: Thus Wit nor Folly, neither will or can Do mischiefe like the foole-wise, rash-proud man. 11. Labour in vaine. A rayling Knave can libell and revile With tongue and pen, his worke about to bring; But wisdome hath the power at him to smile, Whilst Rascalls gain the Gallows and a string. 12. Hang pride. Why in gay Garments do fond fooles take pride? Cloaths are sins pennance, made to hide our shame; Had man forborn to sin, no man had dy'd, And cloaths (like fig-leaves) cannot hide nor blame. 13. Another. Something (I know not what) hath made me proud, I know 'tis neither Lands, or Coyne, nor cloathing; Nor of such parts, wherewith my mindes endow'd, But I am proud, that I am proud of nothing. 14. Another to the same tune. According to the wearers worthynesse I do esteeme, or not esteeme Apparell; An outside brave, an inside base may dresse, For tryall shews what Liquor's in the Barrell. 15. Just payment. I rather would doe well, and not be prais'd, Then to doe ill, and have much commendation: For by the one to blisse I may be rais'd, And by the other gain my condemnation. 16. Content. If I have Health, I will no sicknesse feare, If I be Sick, of Health I'le not dispaire: Let God doe with me what he pleaseth here, If Fortune wrong me, Hope shall me repaire. 17. Sufficient knowledge. Hee's wise enough, that knows enough, but he That would know more then is enough's a foole: Our Parents knew, but knowing more would be, And knew too much out of the Serpents Schoole. 18. Of Death. Our dayly minding Death doth sweeten it, It makes us dye no sooner, but more fit. 19. Well and ill. To doe good without promise, is a grace, To promise, and not doe, is vile and base: Rich Knaves doe poore Fooles with vaine hopes oft fill With promises of good, performing ill. 20. Beware Hypocrisie. He that doth say his Prayers, and goes to bed, Forgives his foes, forgets revenge and spite, And straight wayes hammers mischiefe in his head, The Divell is his bedfellow that night. 21. Of the fashion. To be in fashion, 'tis the only way To be quite out of fashion, if you can To be fantastick, shapelesse in aray, And all Religions is an English man. 22. Of speech. To speake all that I know, would shew small wit, To speake more then I know, were worse then it. 23. On long and short life. If life be long, 'tis troublesome and weary, Their Miseries are most that longest tarry: We make the bad world worse, he travells best That soonest ends his journy, and at rest. 24. Of true friendships use. 'Tis happynesse to have a Friend at need, But if my Folly slight that happynesse: Like him that spares to speake, may spare to speed, So too much manners leaves us in distresse. 25. Better lost then kept. Who e're he be, that seemes my friend to be, And headlong runs in every vicious course: His friendship sure will never better me, And I'le forsake him, lest he make me worse. 26. Extreames. Woe is in want, and dangers in excesse To live and give, I wish no more or lesse: Content's enough, some men are weake, some stronger, And more doe dye by surfeits then by hunger. 27. A fig for Fortune. Fortune my foe doth frown on me, but why? Because I'le not adore her Diety: She scornes me, and I scorne to be her thrall, Much lower then I am, I cannot fall. 28. Good gain'd from bad. When as a bad man doth good Doctrine teach, His words, but not his workes to me doe preach: His sayings all are mine, his are his deeds, I have the Hearbs and Flowers, and he the Weeds. 29. How I would be esteemed. I rather would be innocent and free, And (on suspition) wrongfully corrected: Then to be guilty of great crimes, and be In high regard, respected, unsuspected. 30. Reverence to Saints. I reverence all Saints dead, and all that live, I honour much their blessed memory; But if Gods glory unto Saints I give, How can I hope God will me glorifie? 31. Do thy worst blind Fortune. If Fortune tosse me, yet I still have scope To fear her smiles, and when she frownes to hope. 32. Want of knowledge. Had I e're thought that money would be scant, I had kept some against these times of want: Or had I known what Ware would be sold dear, I would have been a Merchant but one year. 33. Had I wist. If thou wilt quiet be at Board and Bed, Beware of, had I wist, before thou Wed: Comfort comes slow, but cares increase in heaps; A wise man therefore looks before he leaps. 34. Fast and loose. Fast bind, fast find: my Bible was well bound; A Thiefe came fast, and loose my Bible found: Was't bound and loose at once? how can that be? 'Twas loose for him, although 'twas bound for me. 35. A lye, and no lye. Tis not still out of sight and out of minde, For one may mind his meat that is stark blind: But he that's blind, and hath no mind to eat, Then out of sight and mind, is that mans meat. 36. True Love. He that can live by love, lives wondrous well; True love beyond all treasure doth excell: Give me that Love to live well, and to trust In God and goodnesse, other love is lust. 37. Treasure. Love is no lack: yet what I love I lack, A constant friend, whose friendship will not crack: Give me a friend that's true, and he shall have My Love (Sans) Lack, till I am in my Grave. 38. To be rul'd, or not rul'd. The Proverb faith: Be't better, or be't worse, Be alwayes rul'd by him that beares the Purse: But Judas bore the Purse, and such as he, I hope shall never beare rule over me. 39. Wit bought too deare. They say, Wit's never good till it be bought, And being bought too deare it proves stark naught: Such wit had they whose ill got pounds and pence Bought bloudy war, and hunted Peace from hence. 40. All comes to one passe. Dick, and Tom borrowed Gold, and like true debters, Non-payment shakled them in iron fetters: Were the debt iron, fetters gold, what then? Poor Dick and Tom were ne're the richer men. 41. A hopefull Boy. The Boy sayd, Father, whither so hastily? Quoth he to th'Butchers, Jack, some Biefe to buy: Father, he'le cheat you if you go alone; Take the Dog with you, two heads better than one. 42. A plain case. 'Tis no dissembling, (as I understand) T'hold fire in one, and water in tother hand: One hand the pipe holds, with fire smoak, and smother, When often good strong Water's in the other. 43. All is true. Thou that with brags thy furious Fame supportest, Remember that the curst Cows horns are shortest: The bawling Cur will very seldome bite, And bragging Knaves can better eat than fight. 44. Well grown is good. In twelve years, Grace a fine tall womans grown, Shot up in height, the like is seldome known: The times are bad, if Grace prove good, then Grace Is well grown; but Ill weeds will grow apace. 45. Few faults. Most men have many faults, but Ned hath none, Amongst the many he hath scarcely one: He's so much faultlesse in meat, drink, and cloathing, And other sins, that he is good for nothing. 46. A chac'd unchaste woman. Will prais'd his Wife, a vertuous Dame to be, And that few females were so chaste as she: If thou hadst sworn it (Will) thou hadst not ly'd For she was chac'd by Whippers through Cheapside. 47. To be quiet or unquiet. To hear much, to say little, and do lesse, Are great preservatives of quietnesse: But to hear little, say much, and do more, Such dispositions shall have trouble store. 48. Avoyd Hypocrisie. Faults with Hypocrisie that cover'd are, Are worse than crimes that be stark naked bare: He may mend whose bad deeds are still in sight, But there's no Devill to the Hypocrite. 49. Freedome and Bondage. When one gives to me freely, I know well, That for his freenesse, I my freedome sell: For unto him that gives I must conclude, I am bound fast in Bonds of gratitude. 50. Glorious Vanity. He that his Reputation seeks to raise, By praysing of himselfe, himselfe disprayseth: Though he for Arts and Arms do merit praise, His glory's vaine, whom selfe vain-glory raiseth. 51. Of just anger. I may be angry, and no mallice beare, I must be angry with my sins I wot: It is a vertue few can purchase here, At once to be both angry and sin not. 52. Wilfull Will. 'Tis apt for men to fall in Errours vaine, From bad to worse, from worse to worst of ill: But he's a foolish Reprobate in graine, That willing falls, and wilfully lies still. 53. A brace of Beagles. A Sland'rer, and a Flatt'rer are Vile Beasts, One's devilish wild, the other's damned tame; Where ere they come they are accursed Guests, They murther soule and body, name and fame. 54. A good Memento. No cursed Lucre in my minde shall creep, Sins sad remembrance robs me of my sleep: One day of life doth shoave another on, Untill one after one, my dayes are done. 55. Mutability. In various times we dayly live and move, To day a mighty man on Cockhorse mounted, To morrow Fortune gives him a remove, And as an abject Knave he is accounted. 56. Good Greatnesse. Most sweet, most Worthy, Honourable, Great Is he that for his God and Countrey dyes: The world shall with his praises be repleat, And grace with glory him immortalize. 57. Of Angels. Invisible two sorts of Angels are, And those celestiall and infernall be: And Earthly Angels, like black Swans are rare, Meer strangers all, invisible to me. 58. The Crosse brings glory. A Christians crosses glory doth begin, That glory doth not end his misery: But yet that misery shall glory win, And Grace will crowne it with eternity. 59. Words are winde. Words are but wind that do from men proceed, None but Camelions on bare Aire can feed: Great men large hopefull promises may utter; But words did never Fish or Parsnips butter. 60. Feares and jealousies. The sting of conscience, Jealousies and Feares, Makes mad men fall together by the eares: If these three were all banish'd into Hell, (From whence they came) all would be peace and well. 61. B and C. How can the word call'd Changed, Hanged B? With ease, if you but take away the C. 62. Adoration. All knees shall bow at Jesus Name, but not To Jesus Image will I bow one jot. 63. Honest Besse May. Besse May may honest be, who e're sayes nay, But May once past, there are eleven months more: 'Tis mighty odds, and I will never lay Eleven to one: Besse May may be a Whore. 64. Quick and free passage. Who sayes the Gospel hath not passage free? He lies most basely, if he were my Brother: If passeth so quick, that it seems to flee Too swiftly, in at one eare, out at t'other. 65. Desperate Dick. Dick is a desperate fellow, but at what? He hath no mercy on his meat, or Wench: He drank a Dutch man drunk as any Ratt, He's stouter at a Trencher, then a Trench. 67. A slovenly Schollar. In Tristram it is hard to be discern'd, Whether he is most sloven, or most learn'd: He weares his cloaths most foule, rides without Yet learnedly speakes sentences in sirrops. 68. To a scornfull Reader. Grave Ignoramus, cries tush, pish, mew, And on my lines lookes dunsicall a skew: And draws his mouth in scorn so near his eare, So much awry, he seems to whisper there. 69. Manna and Mammon. Mammon, (corrruply gaind) compare I may To Manna, gatherd on the Sabboth day: They are the Devils blessings, but Gods curse Unto the soule, the body and the purse. 70. Blind zeale. Zeale contrary to knowledge, is not right, Theres too much heat in't, and too little light: He that in perfect Zeale would be compleat, Let him have true light, he shall want no heat. 71. On the late Kings poore servants. We never did in armes the State offend, Yet want of means makes misery our end: Had we the Fortune but to be believ'd. Our happynes would be, to be reliev'd. 72. A good faith. He that wants Faith, and apprehends the griefe Of what he wants, he hath a true beliefe: He that doth grieve, because his griefe's too small, Hath a true griefe, but the best Faith of all. 73. Gluttony inward and outward. Mans Maw consumes (by Gluttony's command) Fish, Fowle, Fruits, Beasts, from Sea, or Ayre, and Land; And in his words his glut'nous mouth doth sin, More oft by giving out, then taking in. 74. Sir reverence love. Tom swore to Kate, her sweet and comely making Had fill'd him full of rumbling belly aking: Sweet heart (quoth he) I shall be grieved thus, Till I in thy sweet presence do untruss. 75. Kates kind Answer. For thy sake Tom, my prayer, and plaint, and mone is, I love thee Dear, as Venus lov'd Adonis: And therefore let not thy affections wander, I'le love thee as the Goose doth love the Gander. 76. Brave resolution. Will is all heart, and like a Hart can run, He's wise in Battle, that can danger shun: If strong hands cannot victory attain, Yet light and nimble heeles may safety gain. 77. Leggs worthy of love. A Cut-purse cuts, and swiftly ran away, But yet for all his nimble fingers cunning, Hands deserv'd hanging, legs without delay Sav'd all the body from it, by swift running. 78. Paine with pleasure. My Ladies shooe did pinch her, and yet please her, her painfull pride her pretty foot did grace: It did at once both anger and appease her, Whilst smiles and frownes danc'd Anticks in her face. 79. Friends are better then Lovers. Lovers and Friends are two things; he that loves May waver, and not alwayes be a Friend; But he that is a friend experience proves His Love and Friendship's constant to the end. 80. Of lying and giving. Why are not Maids afraid to Lye, declare, Most men with lying buy and sell their Ware: But many Maids do neither sell or buy, They Give their Maidenheads, and then they Lye. 81. Great Place, small Grace. When Great (not Goodmen) Offices possesse, Who are Revengefull, Greedy, and oppresse; Dismisse such Knaves, that so their Place disgraces, And let good Places, still remaine the Places. 82. A great Witch. Pride is a Witch, few from her charme escapes, She turns us dayly into sundry shapes: She hath her Spirits, who do work like Thrashers, Mercers, soft Silke-men, Taylors, Habberdashers. 83. Repast, and Repose. The Rich man hath Repast, but small Repose, The poor man hath repose, with small Repast: One alwayes strives to gaine, and fears to lose, The other with content doth please his tast. 84. Sunday. The Lords Day is the Lanthorne and the Light Of th'other six dayes, to direct us Right: Or like the Sun, amidst the Planets seven, To light us heer on Earth, and hence to Heaven. 85. Sabaoth. The Jewes observ'd the Sabaoth constantly In memory of Rest, and their Creation: We should our Sundayes keep obediently, To minde us of Redemption and Salvation. 86. A sweet Saint. Phillip doth think his Wife's a Saint, and shee In pure pride thinks her selfe a Saint to bee: Shee'le scold, be proud, and in a corner kiss, And this is Phillips Saint, the Devill she is. 87. Want and abundance. A man may want Coyn, Cloaths, Drink, and Meat, He may want health, sight, hearing, hands, and toes, But cares, and griefes and sorrows, may be great, The late Kings servants have no want of those. 88. A hard businesse. Should Whores and Thieves be all hang'd, 'twere great pity, 'Twould halfe unpeople Country, Towne, and City: But hang up Drunkards, Swearers, Whorers, then (And all the Knaves) what should we do for men? 89. Thoughts and words. My Thoughts are free, I wish my tongue were so, Then would I freely speake what I do think; But yet my tongue, too boldly shall not go, It is more safe at injuries to wink. 90. Good mornings practise. First worship God, he that forgets to pray, Bids not himselfe good morrow, or good day: Let thy first worke be, to confesse thy sins, And then thy dayly businesse well begins. A SATYRE: Hypocrisie discovered. A holy crew of brethren conventickl'd With Scriptures strange Interpretations pickl'd; And sanctified sisters, whose nonsence Snoach'd through the Nose, their Doctrines quintessence: They held unlawfull, and that no man may So much as dresse his meat on th'Sabboth day: Another sayd (like a most subtle plodder) Folke must not milke their Cowes, nor give Beast fodder: The third replyd, it was a grievous crime To let their Jacks turn spits in Sermon time: But if ought must be done without delaying, It's to be done whilst Common Prayer's saying; For when that's ended, straight the Psalme begins, And they'l go singing to repent their sins: Then said a fourth, it fils my heart with wo To see a Preacher ride, Christ bad them go And teach all Nations, verily to me This riding is no godly sight to see: A fift man sayd (brethren) it is my lot (As you all know) to sell Ale by the pot: And (my belov'd) my Brewer brought me late Ale, a french crown the barrell above rate: But had not Orders from the State forbid it, To buy such drinke, sure I should ne're have did it: The Saturday at night they brought it in, The Sabboth day to worke it did begin: Surely 'twas most prophane unhallowed drink Brewd with some Jewes, or Turkish Mault I thinke; For I perswaded it from worke to leave, And more and more it still did huffe and heave: I with much griefe unto the teaching went, Where Giles the Weaver gave me much content; The next day I the Barrels head beat out, And let the Ale run all the house about; As good for nought but hogs to swill and swash, And for the Swine 'twas comfortable wash: Brother (sayd one) although too dear you payd, You did do well, because you disobeyed; And you did better (as all wise men thinke) When (zealously) you spilt that wicked drinke. Another sayd, when I did set mine eye on The Kings Armes in the Church, the Rampant Lyon; His priap mov'd concupiscentiall motions, And did disturbe and hinder my devotions: But when my husband came to be Church-warden, I'le have some form of Flowers from Field or Garden, Or sedge, or flags betwixt his legs were painted, That hid his whimwham which my minde had tainted. A Satyre against swearing, equivocation, mentall reservation, and detestable dissimulation. To pretend, and the contrary to intend, With th'World began, and with the World shall end: The Divell himselfe (who first made man a sinner) Of this dissembling Art, was the beginner. Since when, his Sons, and Schollars, Hypocrites, Accursed Antichristian Jesuites, Christ kissing trayterous bast Iscariothites, Soule foundred, soules confounding Hereticks, All cheverell conscienc'd cockbrain'd Schismaticks. With many nicknam'd Romane Catholicks; And every Heresie, and Schisme, or Sect, All diffring, and all boast to be th'Elect: Pretending all, true zeale to preach and pray, Intending all the clean contrary way. Amazed, and amated much I am To see Great Brittain turn'd to Amsterdam; Six years agone we had of Sex fourescore, Which are encreast now to one hundred more: A Book that's call'd the Gangrean, printed late, Their Authors and Opinions doth repeat: Ninescore Religions that book sheweth cleer, Lord, what a Harvest hath the Devill made heer: Those all pretend Religion, but indeed Most of them scarcely know their Christian Creed. The Devill can turn himselfe t'an Angell bright, Seem to pretend no wrong, yet do no right: He did pretend to make our Parents great, As is their Maker, but by that defeat He did intend, like to himselfe to make 'em Fiends (or fiends fellows) that God might forsake 'em. Cain did pretend with Abell, like a friend And brother, when he murther did intend: When Absolon seem'd to pretend no ill To Amnon, he intended him to kill; He did pretend Religions good desire, When he his Fathers Throne intends t'aspire: Achitophell pretended Truth and Reason, When he intended foolishnesse and treason: Saul did pretend great love to David, but He did intend how he his throat might cut: Joab pretended to be Abners friend, When (with a stab) he brought him to his end: The wicked Jewes (with noyse) Hosanna cri'd To him, they few dayes after crucifi'd: And Judas sayd, haile Master, when he meant Foule treason, to betray the Innocent: Thus in all Ages, since the Worlds Creation, Both Devils and men have us'd Equivocation: For as a cunning Fencer, looking down, Aymes at the foot, but means to crack the crown So squint eyd, true, false friendship, seems to see, But ne're intends, what it pretends to bee: We're too much leavend, like the Pharisees, And to all goodnesse meere Antipodes: He's counted the best man, that best can prate, Though's deeds and words be illegitimate. If our good words with good works could agree, The world no better people had then we: Yet too too many this bad time affords That cannot give to God or man good words; Nor for themselves, or of themselves can they Speak one good word in any thing they say. Their speech to God (or of God) is most base, To curse or sweare are th'only garbs of grace: Their prayers unto God are, God dam, forsake 'em, Renounce, confound, consume, the Devill take 'em; Sink, rot their soules, for evermore renounce 'em, Consume them, or in hell to powder pounce 'em: These, with some prayers like these, they night and da With great devotion fervently do pray. To God they speak thus, but when they speak of him, 'Tis either to blaspheam, deride, or scoffe him; With cursed tongues, and teeth, to rend and teare His dreadfull name, when they forsweare and sweare. Too oft these wretched Imps these oaths afford, By God, Christ Jesus, by the living Lord, By God Almighty, by th'eternall God, Thus under foot his glorious name is trod By godlesse Villains, who will brag and boast That He's the bravest man that sweareth most. God is no God to them, they do reject him, Like skild Anatomists they will dissect him; They rip him up with Oaths from foot to head, His wounds, blood, heart, nailes, body, soule, and bread, His blessed and soule-saving life, his death, These cursed oaths are belch'd with th'odious breath Of Hels dear hel-hounds, who to practise these, They lie and study on their beds of ease. To flourish their discourse, their brains are framing New coyned oaths, to grace pots, pipes, and gaming. Sure these good fellows have some friends in hell, And with them they desire to be and dwell; Or ese they have a great desire to see Hels Kingdome, and what things the Devils bee. And as men that would travell, would attaine Some knowledge in the tongues of France, or Spaine, Th'Italian, or the High, Low, spacious Dutch, The Russe, Shavonian, Latine, Greeke, or such As is the language where they mean to go, Each Traveller these tongues would gladly know, That when they came to any forraine Land, They might the peoples speeches understand: So swearers will to hell a voyage make, And therefore they most studious pains do take To learn hels language, to blaspheam and sweare, That all their friends may understand them there: These men in their mad furies do suppose That Hel's a Kingdome where all pleasure grows; And that Elyzium is a pleasant place, Where soules immortall dance the wild-goose chase: Their stupid brains the Devill hath so possest, That Hel's a place of wealth, joy, peace, and rest; That Heaven's a fiction, and no place of pleasure, That to be damn'd is everlasting treasure: This is the cause they scorne to aske salvation, And pray God dam 'em, and beg for damnation. 'Tis wonder to see mad men beat their brains To gain perdition, and eternall pains: Of God they (like the foole) do think there's none, Or that he is a weake and simple one; One that regards not what men do below, Or sees not, knows not, how the world doth go; This is the swearers faith, his mirth, his game, Else he durst ne're blaspeam th'Almighties name. Pluto's and asse, and Belzebub's a foole, 'And Lucifer himselfe may go to schoole; For all the Conclave of the Devils in Hell Cannot a cursed swearer parallell: Sometimes of Christianity they'l prate, Yet live a life, abhord and reprobate. 'Tis sayd, that charity at home begins, And that love hids a multitude of sins; Subjection to high Powers we are enjoynd, Obedience unto all of every kind, Of these rare vertues, swearers have no share, To no body they charitable are; I truely think he loves himselfe not well, That prayes God dam him, and doth wish for Hell: Want of selfe love and charity do prove He beares to no man charity or love. If to himselfe his love no better be, His charity and love is not for me: Can they do service to an earthly King, That oaths and curses against God dare fling? No, those as dare the heavenly power blaspheam Are no good servants for power lesse supream: The wrath of God is hot, his anger burns, And for vain swearing, the whole Land now mourns; This Nation, and the people at division, No peace but by the sanguine swords decision. The Land's o'respread with leprosie of swearing, And Gods great patience weary of forbearing; For which his plagues of slaughtering sword we find, And 'tis much fear'd famine's not far behind: Yet swearers to be Christians do pretend, Though (worse then Atheists) they their lives do spend; That Pagans, Heathens, Infidels, Jewes, Turkes, Sweare lesse, and use better words and workes. Time was, that Justice did the sword unsheath, That the blaspheamer strait was ston'd to death; And in this wicked wretched Generation, Swearing is counted manly reputation, Or recreation, or the Gentile grace Of speeches fine Embrodery, like gold lace Upon a saddle, which a sow must weare, So it becomes a Gentleman to sweare: The Devill is bad, but sure the swearer's worse, For I ne're heard the Devill did sweare or curse. What execrable creatures are they then, But Hell-hounds, and the Devils Journy-men? Himselfe doth scorn to do a worke so base, His basest Rascals do supply that place: How can these men plead Christianity, When as they want common humanity? Mad fooles, who every day do beg and crave Damnation, which they would be loth to have. The sacred Text, the Pulpit, and the Presse Have prest these faults hard to mens consciences; Yet all that ever hath been spoke or pend, Hath made the swearer not a whit amend: These bitter lines of mine, may worke perhaps To Muzzle or bung up some swearers chaps: God and good men I'm sure are on my side, And I (in all that's written) have not lyde: Some do pretend a peace, and much do prattle, Yet do intend to bloodshed, and to battle: But let them never claime a Christian name, Whose trade and pleasure is in blood and flame Of their dear Country, and rip, rend, and tear Their mothers womb, which did such bastards bear. These sons of Hittites, and of Amorites, God do to them, as to the Midianites. Psal. 8 3. Make them as Jabin, and as Sisera dy'd At Endors field, where Kishons Brook doth slyd. As they became as dung, so let them bee That to a lawfull peace will not agree. The Peace of God, grant us, thou God of Peace, Let us cease sin, thou wilt our sorrows cease; Let's frame our lives according to thy word, And let no sword be drawn, but Justice sword: To which end, thou good God of consolation, Send blessed Peace to this afflicted Nation. FINIS. THE CERTAIN TRAVAILES of an uncertain JOURNEY, Begun on Tuesday the 9. of August, and ended on Saturday the 3. of September following, 1653. A merry Bill of an uncertaine Journey, to bee performed by John Taylor, by Land, with his Aqua Musa. To all my Friends, and courteous Gentlemen, Know, that my journey is, I know not when: Unto the parts I goe, I know not where, Or of my entertainement far or neare; Thus neither knowing when, or where, or whether, Begun, or done, or both ends brought together, When I this unknowne Walke have put in print, Each man to's pocket, put your fingers in't, And for my Booke then give me what you list, To which end, to this Bill, take pen in fist, And write your names and habitations down, I'le finde you when againe I come to Towne. The certainty of the uncertaine Travels of John Taylor, performed in this yeere 1653. Tis laudable to read well pen'd Relations Of foreign Countries, &amp; their situations, That by the judgement of the eie &amp; brain Some knowledge to discourse we may attain. For Histories, and learn'd Cosmographers, And diligent acute Geographers; One hath survay'd celestiall lofty sphears, How all the Planets run in their carriers: The stars, the signes, and every influence In every Heavenly Orbs circumference, And were it not for high Astronomy (Whose lofty painfull steps have scal'd the sky) For times and seasons we might grope and seek, Not knowing yeers, or quarters, month, or week, Or houres, or minutes, nor the Sabbath day, Nor when to eat, or sleep or debts to pay. Millions of people would this knowledge lack Except directed from the Almanack: Thus Art, (with pains and travell of the mind) Taught mean capacities, these things to find. He travels far that goes beyond the Moone, Or thinks this skill may be attayned soone. Their overweening thoughts flie high and quick But such mad fooles are only lunatick. Geographers have travel'd land and seas Each coast, and opposite Antipodes; And the description of all lands and parts Described are, in severall Maps and Charts. The Sun &amp; Moon have seldom shewd their faces On any Empire, Kingdom, place, or places, Which Travellers have not viewd and survayd. And by rare Geographique Art displayd, By either sea or land, by night or day, Geography hath chalk'd us out the way: That with Maps, Compas, &amp; indifferent weather True men or Thieves may travell any whither. And thus throgh thick &amp; thin, ways hard or soft, Thousand and thousand miles I travel'd oft. Some men do travell in their contemplations, In reading Histories and strange Relations: Some few do travell in the wayes Divine, Some wander wildly with the Muses nine; For every man would be a Poet gladly, Although he write and Rime but badly madly. Sometimes the wits and tongues do, most unfit, Travell, when tongues do run before the wit. But if they both keep company together, Delight and profit is in both, or eyther. Discretion gravely goes a gentle pace, When speech, &amp; gallop, runs a heedles race: Mans earthly portion's travell, paine, and care, (Of which I make a shift to get my share.) Some do disdain, and hold it in high scorn To know thatcht cottages where they were born Some crosse the sea to see strange lands unknown And heer, like strangers, do not know their own. Their own, 'tis fit work for a golden pen To write the names down of such knowing men: Should ech on know &amp; have his own, 'twere rare Right owners wold be rich, &amp; knaves stark bare. Hee's counted wise, with the Italians, That knows his own wife from another mans. But hee's more wise that knows himselfe to be Fraile, mortall, and a Map of Misery. But wisest he, that patient takes his lot, And use the world as if he us'd it not. Some seem to know most, yet know almost nothing, For man, in knowledge, is a very slow thing. Nosce teipsum, Know thy selfe, and then Each one will know himselfe the worst of men. Many of forreign travels boast and vant, When they, of England, are most ignorant. But yeerly I survey my Country Native, And, 'mongst 6. cases, live upon the Dative, I travell hard, and for my lifes supply, I every yeere receive a Subsidie, (Or else to come more neer unto the sence) Tis fit to call it a Benevolence. Thus (travelling) a toyling trade I drive, By reason of mine age, neer seventy five: It is my earthly portion and my lot, (The Proverb says, Need makes the old wife trot.) Seven times at sea I serv'd Elizabeth, And 2. Kings forty five yeers, untill death Of both my Royall Masters quite bereft me, That nothing now but age and want is left me. This makes me travell, and my friends to trie, Else I might (like my fellowes) sterve and die. Had the last State, had consciences so tender To think on Oxford siedge, with that surrender, Had they kept Articles and Covenants, In some sort, then they had releev'd our wants, But they were in the land of Promise borne, Perform'd, and paid us nothing, but their scorn. Camelion like we had Ayre, Words, and Wind, With these three empty dishes oft we din'd. And with light Suppers, and such breaking Fast, With meagre Famine, many breath'd their last. we nere bare arms, but houshold servants menial We waited, if 'twere sin, it was but veniall. These thirteen yeers no wages I could get, Which makes me thus to try my friends &amp; wit. Unto the Kings Revenews great Committee We oft Petitiond, and implor'd their pitty; And first and last, we gave Petitions plenty, I'm sure, in number, neer two hundred twenty. Two thousand Books &amp; Bils then printed were, Wherein our woes and wants wee did declare: Lord Fairfax was himsilfe Lord Generall then, He pitied us (poor miserable men;) And he in person, more then one time went And told our griefes unto the Parliament. Besides, for us, to them he Letters wrot, For all which, only, promises we got. I will not curse those men, but this I say, If need and want afflict them, I doe pray They may be comforted, and fed, and clad With promises, as we from them have had. Th'yeer sixteen hundred fifty, with 3. added, Old Tib my Mare, and I, a journy gadded: I London left, the 9. day I remember Of August, neer 3. weeks before September. In 4. houres riding Post I got to Croydon, And so hath many a man, and many a boy done. There was the George a horseback day &amp; night, And there I, from my mares back did alight. At Water there wine was, but that's a Riddle, At Croydon, you may know both ends &amp; middle. To Micham, from my way full 3. miles wide, A Gentleman, I thank him, was my guide. Holland my sheets, and Holland was mine Host, My entertainment good for little cost. August the tenth, my Bonny Beast and I, From Surrey traveld to South Saxony, Now called Suffex, where at Bellinshurst Six dayes I felt no hunger, cold, or thirst. There at a sign, and no sign but a Frame, Twas the Kings arms, but shatering shot &amp; flame Did beat them down, as useles, of small stead, For armes are of no use without a Head. Mine Host was mighty good, and great withall, And, amongst Hosts, may be a Generall. Hee's friendly, curteous, although big and burly, A right good fellow, no way proud or surly. Six nights at Bellinshurst I freely stayd, And all the charge of mare and man was payd By a gentleman, to name whom Ile refrain, Whose love, my thankfull mind shall stil retain. Thus in one week I rode Post 30. mile, And neither man or mare tyr'd all that while. A Reverend Preacher preach'd on Sunday twice Directing souls to th'Heavenly Paradice; And if we could but do as he did say, His Doctrine told us all the ready way. Thus Billingshurst thy bounty I extoll, Thou feastedst me in body and in soule. There was rare Musick, sweet and gentile Ayres For undeserved favours I am theirs. My love to Mr. Fist, and to mine Host, But love and thanks T. H. deserveth most. From Billinshurst, August the sixteenth day, I took my leave, before I took my way. The way indifferent good, the welk in smiles, I rode to Petworth, 7. good Sussex miles. To set forth Petworth, its worth more worth is, Then I am worth, or worthy; but know this, Northumberland the Noble, there doth dwell, Whose good housekeeping, few Lords parallell. There Honourable bounty is exprest, While daily charity to th'poor distrest. I speak not this for any thing I got Of that great Lord, I felt or saw him not: For had I seen him, my beliefe is such, I should have felt and found his bounties tutch: But I, for my part, never was so rude To flatter, fawn, or basely to intrude, Yet I declare him liberall, Honourable, And there I din'd well, at his Stewards Table. Thanks Mr. Williams there, the Cook exact By his good friendship there, I nothing lackd. Thanks to my Hostesse kind, good Mrs. Martin, Who welcom'd me with good whit wine a quart in. And last of all, but not of all the least, I was kind Mr. Barnards costly Guest: To me he shew'd his bounty from the Mint, For which I give him heer my thanks in Print. He payd the chinque, and freely gave me drink, And I returne my gratitude with Inke. August the 18. twelve long miles to Stenning I rode, and nothing saw there worth the kenning, But that mine Host there was a joviall Wight, My Hostess fat and fair; a goodly sight: The signe the Chequer, eighteen pence to pay; My Mare eat mortal meat, good Oats and Hay. Twelve miles from Stenning I jogd on to Lewes, And there I found no Beggars, Scolds, or Shrews; Lewes hath no Bayliff, Mayor, or Magistrate, For every one there lives in quiet state: They quarrell not for wagging of a straw, For each man is unto himselfe a Law; They need no bridle (like the Horse or Mule) Where every one himselfe can wisely rule. At the terrestriall Star (a glistring Signe) I lodg'd, and found good Diet and good Wine; Mine Host and Hostess courteous, free, and kind, And there I sip'd and sup'd, but seldom din'd: Lewes is an ancient Town, as may be seen In Cambden, page three hundred and thirteen; Twelve men they chuse, the most substantiallest, Most rich and wise, to govern all the rest; And out of that discreet and honest dozen, Two (as it were) high Constables are chosen: These have no pow'r themselvs to hang or draw, Or on offendors to inflict the Law; But to a Justice of the Peace, or Coram They bring the parties, &amp; their cause before am. From Friday unto Friday I did stay, But in the mean time I did take my way Five miles to Torring where my old friend there, The Parson welcom'd me with Country cheer; His name is John, or honest Master Rice, Six meals he meated me, and lodgd me thrice. He Preachd on Sunday, Augusts twenty one, Two Sermons, tending to salvation: His Doctrine's good, &amp; he himselfe doth frame To live in conversation like the same. I thank him, and his Wife and Family, For making of so much (too much) of me: Thus when he could no longer me retaine, With love and thanks, I rode to Lewes againe. This Town contains six Churches, and at least It is a mile in length from West to East: A strong and spacious Castle there hath been, As by its moldred ruines may be seene. Thence 12. miles I was on my female beast born, T'an unknown feast born, at a Towne cal'd East Bourne; I at an Inne alighted, and found there Unlook'd for welcome, and good Sussex cheer: Sir Thomas Dike, Sir Thomas Parker, Knights, With kinde Esquires, whose names &amp; Epithites I mention not, because I know them not; But to them all my thanks is unforgot, For undeserv'd, unlook'd for, and unthought, From th? my purse &amp; person both were fraught; This was on Augusts twenty sixt, a Friday, Near Dog dayes end, a very fair and drie day. The next day, and the next I felt the bounty Of the high Sheriff of Sussex famous County; He entertain'd me Saturday and Sunday, And would have kept me 20 dayes past Monday. There was a high and mighty drink call'd Rug. Sure since the Reigne of great King Gorbodug, Was never such a rare infus'd confection, Injection, operation, and ejection, Are Hogen Mogen Rugs, great influences To provoke sleep, and stupifie the sences. No cold can ever pierce his flesh or skin Of him who is well lin'd with Rug within: Rug is a Lord beyond the Rules of Law; It conquers hunger in the greedy maw: And (in a word) of all the drinks potable, Rug is most puisant, potent, notable. Rug was the Capitall Commander there, And his Lievtenant Generall was strong Beere. Wine plenteous both in Bottles and in flaggons, whose str?gth would quel S. George &amp; 20 dragg?s But Assbuerus Laws were there inrol'd, No man was forc'd to drink more then he would. There was good Will, good Wills son, &amp; good Willi? As free as was the Emp'rour Maximilian: Beasts, fowls and fish, from earth, &amp; sea &amp; ayre, Unto the Table, well Cook'd did repair, There were rare Birds I never saw before The like of them, I think to see no more. Th'are called Wheat ears, less then Lark or Sparrow, Wel roasted, in the mouth they tast like marow. When once tis in the teeth it is involv'd, Bones, flesh, and all, is lushiously dissolv'd, The name of Wheat ears, on them is ycleap'd, Because they come when wheat is yeerly reap'd. Six weeks, or therabouts, they are catch'd there, And are welnigh II. months, God knows where. My humble gratitude is heer exprest To Mr. Sheriffe, and his beloved best; His kindnes joind with hers, and hers with his, Doth merit my unfaigned thankfulnes. Unto my Cozen Thomas Taylor there My love remembred, and for my Samphiere He promis'd me, I thank't him thrice before, And when I have it, I will thank him more. Twelve miles on Augusts 9. and 20. day, From Bourne to Battell, 4. miles on my way At Pemsey doth a ruin'd Castle stand, And there the Norman Conqueror did land. Since his invading power arrived there, 'Tis now 500, 60, and 6. yeere. Eight miles from thence, the Battel fierce was strook Where bloud of 70000, like a Brook, Or rather I may say like Sanguin Rivers Which down hills, it impetuously delivers Into the Vales: and where that bloud was spilt The Conqueror caus'd an Abbey to be built Of stately structure, and what it hath been, By great extended ruines may be seen. When Norman forces England overcame, From bloudy Battell, Battell had its name. This Abbey now is kept, by right and due, By the Honourable Viscount Montague. That Lord repair'd some part magnificent, And ther's good house kept, when hees resident. That noble Lord is, in account most famous, Though many miserable Lords doe shame us. At th'Empereall crest, or Eagle spred, My selfe and mare, were stabled, lodg'd and fed. About the reckoning I did not contend, My friend T. H. paid all, and ther's an end. August the thirtith, I rode on to Hastings, Wher was relief for men of severall tastings, Or sundry pallats, put them altogether, Or relisht appetites, take all or neither. At Hastings I staid not, but hastily I ambled 6. miles unto Winchelsey: Which hath been counted in the dayes of yore, (Untill the seas contended with the shore) A famous sea Town, rich in merchandise, But buried in the Ocean now it lies. A Castle stands i'th sands, enduring flawes, Gusts, tempests, storms, &amp; times devouring jaws: In twice twelve hours, 'tis twice embraced round In th'arms of Neptune, seeming to be drownd: And when the flouds are eb'd into the main, Three miles in sands 'tis compast round again. In Winchelsey that now is I could ken Nothing worth observation of my pen. Two miles from thence, upon a hill, stands Rye, And there I, at the Star, did lodge and lie: More ods there is 'twixt singing songs and crying Then was betwixt my lodging, and my lying. I lodg'd by night, and I did lie by day, And as upon a bed I musing lay, The chamber hang'd with painted cloth, I found My selfe with sentences beleaguerd round. There was Philosophy and History, Poetry Ænigmatick mystery. I know not what the Town in wealth may be, But sure, I on that chambers walls did see More wit then al the town had, and more worth Then my unlearned Muse can well set forth. I will not hold my Reader in dilemma, Thus truly, lying, I transcribed them a. No flower so fresh, but frost may it deface, None sits so fast, but hee may lose his place: Tis Concord keeps a Realme in Stable stay, But Discord brings all Kingdomes to decay. No Subject ought (for any kinde of Cause) Resist his Prince, but yeeld him to the Lawes. Sure God is just, whose stroake, delayed long, Doth light at last, with paine more sharp, and strong, Time never was, nor n'ere I thinke shall be, That Truth (unshent) might speake, in all things free. This is the Sum, the Marrow and the Pith My lying Chamber was Adorned with: And 'tis supposed, those lines written there Have in that Roome bin, more then 40. yeare. Now, Reader take this notice more of Rye, 'Tis worth Remembring, and I'le tell you why: If to unloade your Bellies, Nature drive ye, In all the Towne you'le scarcely finde a Privie. For as our Sectaries in Tubbs preach heere, They make (Sir Reverence) Reverend Iakeses there, Of Pulpets of Prophanity, and these When they are full, are empti'd in the Seas. My fare was good at Rye, my Reck'ning small, I thanke my noble friend, that payd for all, Neere unto Rye, 2 dirty Ferryes bee So Muddy, that they mir'de my Mare and mee: I past them, And on vltima Augusti, Well meated, Mounted, man and beast both lusty; I cross'd or'e Gulford ferry, and I went From Rye in Sussex unto Hide in Kent; Septembers first day, Sol, with golden eye Gilt Neptune with celestiall Alchymie: With sovereign splendor, kissing medows green, And mantled hills tops were coruscant seen. When Phœbus mounted was in glorious pride, I mounted too and rode a way from Hide. Still as I past through sea Towns first and last, I did enquire how businesses had past. The people said that Guns did bounce &amp; thump, Betwixt our English ships and Dutch Van Trump. At Rumney, and at Hide, they were in sight, Folks heard the drums to beat, and saw the fight. Thus, little was the newes from sea or shore, Our weekly News books will tel 3. times more. From Hide to Dover, and to Canterbury Full 25. miles, dirty, wet and weary I took my lodging up, and down I lay Till Friday came, Septembers second day. Then with the Lamb I arose, and with the Lark I got to Gravesend when 'twas almost dark; But I mistake, from sleep I rowz'd my head, And rose with th'Lark, but went with Lamb to bed. On th'way I was not vext with Gates or Stiles, But three and thirty dirty Kentish miles, With washing dashing ways, &amp; rain wel sous'd, It made my Mare and I glad to be hous'd: The signe was Welsh his pie-bald english Bull; I there was welcome empty, welcome full: But at the high and mighty Gravesend Whale, I found most potent admirable Ale, 'Tis second to no drink, but East-Bourne Rug, Put it in Pot or Flaggon, Can or Jug; You'le finde it is the grand Ale, and you'l grant That 'tis Ale Parramount, Predominant: 'Twas given me by a Friend; but let him end With hanging, that loves Ale more then his fri?d. From Gravesend (Saturday Septembers third) I rode without spurs, as I had been spurr'd: I came to London when the Clock struck one; And so my Journey and my Booke is DONE. [Amongst the Muses where the number Nine is] Amongst the Muses where the number Nine is, The learned Poets end their Works with Finis: But when unlearned I have Volumes pen'd, Finis is Latine, English Done's an End. To all my Friends that have subscribed their Names and dwellings to my Bill. According as you pay, or pay me not; So is my lucky or unlucky Lot: I have made use of many friends before Age tels me now I shall do so no more. Some friends I have, and some small share of wit, And want hath forc'd me to vse them, and it. I, in my best of wishes will include Their kindnesse, and my humble gratitude. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIRD COLLECTION A BAWD. A vertuous Bawd, a modest Bawd: As Shee Deserves, reproove, or else applaud. To the neither Noble or Ignoble, Lord or Lady, kind or cruell, learned or ignorant, curteous or currish, Christian or Barbarian, Man or Woman, rich or poore: but to all and every one in generall and particular. My Verse is honest, seemly, neat and cleane, Yet is my Theame polluted and obsceane: Ile touch foule pitch, yet will not be defild, My Muse shall wade through dirt, &amp; not be soild. The Sun on noysome dunghills shines as well, As on faire flowers that doe fragrant smell: The Ayre by which we live, doth every where Breathe still alike upon the poore and Peere. The Sea bears many an old despised Witnesse my paper Boat. Boat, Yet on the Sea the best Ships doe but float, And Earth allowes to all her scattred brood, Food, Clothes and Lodging to the bad and good. Yet Sun, Ayre, Sea, nor Earth receive disgrace By any bountie which they give the base. Even so my Muse, (free from all foule intents) Doth take example from the Elements, In laying better studies by a while, And in cleane fashion write a beastly stile: Yet will I not my sense or meaning marre; With tearmes obscure, or phrases sercht from farre Nor will I any way equivocate, With words sophisticall, or intricate, Vtopian-Fustianisme, poore heathen Greeke, To put my Readers wits to groape and seeke. Small eloquence men must expect from me, My Schollership will name things as they be. I thinke it good, plaine English, without fraud, To call a spade a spade, a Bawd a Bawd. Two little Pamphlets I have wrote before, Which I was bold to call a Thiefe, and Whore, Yet was my Whore so chaste, that she had not, From end to end, one foule offensive spot; Nor did my Thiefe from any man purloyne, Or liv'd by filching either goods or coyne. And now by chance it came into my mind, That with the Bawd my Pen was much behind: My Whore was honest, and my Thiefe was true, And in this sort Ile give the Bawd her due. Strange fruit from my poore barren labour springs, I modestly must use immodest things: 'Tis somewhat hard, but yet it is no riddle, All Bawdry doth not breed below the middle. So many severall sorts of Bawds doe grow, That where there's not a Bawd, 'tis hard to know. The first with spirituall Bawds, whose honor high Springs from the whoredome of Idolatry, Cast but your eyes upon the Man of Rome, That stiles himselfe the Head of Christendome, Christs universall Vicar, and Vicegerent, In whom fooles thinke the Truth is so inherent, That he can soules to Heaven or Hell preferre, And being full of Errours, cannot erre: And though his witchcraft thousands hath entic'd Hee will be call'd Lieutenant unto Christ. How hath that false Conventicle of Trent, Made lawes w?? God, or good men never meant, Commanding worshipping of stones and stocks, Of Relikes, dead mens bones, and senslesse blocks, From which adultrate painted Adoration, Men (worse then stocks or blocks) must seek salvation? The Soules of men are His that dearly bought th?, And he the only way to Heav'n hath taught them. And who so forceth them to false adoring, Is the maine Bawd unto this Spirituall Whoring. Besides, it is apparent, and most cleare, That he's the greatest Bawd the Earth doth beare: For hee that tolerates the Stewes erection, Allowes them Priviledges and Protection, Shares in the profit of their sordid sweat, Reapes yearely Pensions and Revenues great, Permits the Pole-shorne fry of Friers and Monks, For Annuall stipends to enjoy their Puncks. When Hen. Smith in his Treat. of Herodot cap. 38 pag 303. Paul the third the Romish Miter wore, He had contributary Trulls such store, To five and fortie thousand they amount, As then Romes Register gave true account. Besides, it was approv'd, the gaine was cleere Cornelius Agrippa in his vanity of sciences.Full twentie thousand Duckats every yeere. Moreover, once a Bishop (boasting said, He had Ten Thousand Priests that paid (Some more, some lesse (by way of Rent or fines, Each Idem. one of them for keeping Concubines. And he that keepes none, payes as much as he As for his vse doth keepe one, two or three. Al's one, the Priests must pay t'augm?t the treasure Keepe or not keep, Whore or not Whore at pleasure. Now judge, good Reader, have I said amisse, Was ever any Bawdry like to this? Pope Lucrece was first married to her own brother the sonne of Pope Alexander the sixt, she being daughter to the said Pope, and daughter in law to him by the marriage with his son. And being concubine to the said Pope, he caused her after his sonne her husbands death, to be married to three princes one after another: First to Duke Iohn Sforza. Secondly, to Lewis sonne to Alphonsus King of Arragon. Thirdly, to Alphonsus D'Est Duke of Ferara. Alexander of that name the sixt, With his owne childe incestuously commixt. And Paul the third (affecting the said Game) With his owne Her name was Constancia, she was married to a Duke named Sforza, but the Pope her father poysoned her because he could not lawfully enioy her. Also for the like he poysoned his sister. daughter did commit the same: And after with his sister tooke such course, That he with her did doe as bad or worse. Iohn the thirteenth, and other more, 'tis plaine Have with their sisters and their daughters laine. And when their stomacks have been gone &amp; past, To Princes they have married them at last. Here's Bawds of State, of high and mighty place, Our Turnbul street poore Bawds to these are base. But these brave doings better to disclose, A little while Ile turne my Verse to Prose. Besides a most pernicious Bawd is hee, That for poore A flattering hireling Preacher, is a Bawd to the vices of his surly Patron, and an hypocriticall conniver at the crying sinnes of his Audience. scraps, and a bare ten pounds fee, Dares not his mighty Patron to offend, Or any way his vices reprehend, Nor preach 'gainst pride, oppression, usury, Dice, drinke, or drabbes, vaine oathes or simony, Nor Veniall sinne or Mortall, or nothing That may his Worship in the Withers wring: But every way must fit his Text and time, To leave untoucht th'Impropriators crime? Thus those whose functions Heaven doth signifie, (Who should like trumpets lift their voices high) Are mute and muzled, for a hireling price, And so are Bawds unto their Patrons vice; For hee's a Bawd who doth his living winne, By hiding, or by flattring peoples sinne; The The Devill is the chiefe Bawd. Prince of darknesse, King of Acheron, Great Emperour of Styx and Phlegeton, Cocytus Monarch, high and mighty Dis, Who of Great Limbo-lake Commander is, Of Tartary, of Erebus, and all Those Kindomes which men Barathrum doe call, Hee is the chiefest Bawd, and still he plods To send us whoring after godlesse gods: And by his sway, and powerfull instigation, Hath made the world starke drunke with fornication. For since the first Creation, never was The least degree of Bawdry brought to passe, But he began it, and contriv'd it still, He layd the plot, and did the Act fulfill. So that of all the Bawds that ever were, The Devill himselfe the Bell away doth beare: Yet all his whoring base Idolatrie, Did seeme Religious zealous sanctitie. To close up all, the Summe of all is this, I'le end my Booke as Ovid ended his. So long as on the Poles the spangled firmament shall whirle, So long as Procreation shall beget a Boy or Girle, So long as winter shall be cold, or Summer shall be hot, So long as poverty and spight shall be true Vertues lot, When Phœbus in the West shall rise, and in the East shall set, When children on (their mothers) their owne fathers shall beget; Then shall this Booke, or Bawd lye dead, and never till that day, Shall Booke or Bawd, or Bawd or Booke, be scarse, if men will pay. Till Sun and Moone shall cease to shine, and all the World lye wast; So long this booke, or else a Bawd, I'me sure, so long shall last. FJNJS.

Epigram. [Queenes Armes] The Queenes Armes and her Armies were renown'd, Eliza's Fame did fill the worlds wide Round: Through al her raign, France lov'd us, Spain did fear us And at her Armes are both their Wines to cheer us. R. Epigram. [Rose] Hee were a man of Art that had the skill Rose water from these Roses to distill: I know theres good Rose Wine, but for Rose Water I oft have still'd, and still find no such matter. Epigram. [Ram] At Ram or Rams head (be it knowne to all) Are Wines Predominant and Capitall, To set a Horseman quite beside the Saddle, And make a Footman's Pericranion Addle. Epigram. [Sun] The Grape is ripened with bright Phœbus shine, Which shewes that at the Sun there is good wine: Beware of being Sun-burn't e're thou goe, Drink civilly, make not thy friend thy Foe. Epigram. [Star] Hee that by these eight Stars can Calculate, Iudge of Nativities, and descant Fate: Yet are their Influences good and bad, Some gaine wit by them, some lose that they had. Epigram. [Ship] Here is a Fleet of Ships, ne're crost the Maine, To bring Commodities from France or Spaine: They ne're fear'd Tempest, Pyrat, Rock, or Wrack, Yet are wel fraight with French wine and good Sack. Epigram. [Swan] These are strange Swans that neither swim or sinke And all their maintenance is onely drink: And I in lofty Verse his praise will sing, That can but pluck a Feather from their wing. Epigram. [Salutation] When men doe meet, and courteously Salute, They at the Salutation may dispute: Some for their profit, some for their love or pleasure, Whilst all their wine is in and out of Measure. T. Epigram. [Tun] These Tuns proclame there's Tuns of Wine below, Goe in and welcome, try, and you shall know: There shall you see a plenteous Spring that runs From Pipes, Buts, Hogsheads, from the liberall Tuns. Epigram. [Turnstile] A Turn-stile is a Bar to keepe out Beasts, Which oft times hath more reason than the Guests: When Wine makes men the Rules of Reason passe, They'r far inferiour to Oxe, Horse, or Asse. Epigram. [Taverne] Where no Signe is, 'tis no ill Signe to mee, Where no Signe is, 'tis no good Signe to see: But though the Signes are neither good nor bad, There's Wine, Good, Bad, Indifferent, to be had. V. Epigram. [Vineyard] The Vineyard doth the lushious Grapes produce, The Vintage Presseth, and makes Wine their Iuce: If these yield no good Wine, I must say still, The Vineyard's Barren, and the Vintage Ill. Epigram. [Venice] The Citty Venice (Strong and Opulent) Fam'd from the Orient, to the Occident: And sure the Signe of such a Noble Citty Affords good Wine, or else the more's the pitty. W. Epigram. [Wrastler] Wrastling is held a Manly exercise, A Game Olimpick, both for Praise and Prize: But hee that is most Skilfull, Strong or Tall, And Wrastles with the Wine, shall surely Fall. Epigram. [Windemill] No Meale-mouth'd Miller Keepes this Mill I know, And let the wind blow either high or low, Hee's kindly taking Toll, and at his Mill Is Wine exceeding good, and Welcome still. Besides these Tavernes before mentioned, there are foure Houses in London that doe sell Rhennish Wine, inhabited onely by Dutchmen; namely, Epigram. [Here's the bright Christall rincing Rhennish Drink] Here's the bright Christall rincing Rhennish Drink, The salt dry'd Neats-tongue, and West-phalia skink: The Pickled Herring, and the Anchovea rare: And (if you please) Potarbo, or Caveare. They deale in Deale wine, and their dealing's Iust: And though their Faith be good, they seldom Trust. [Thus (Gentle Reader) I have ran a Course] Thus (Gentle Reader) I have ran a Course That would have tyr'd (perhaps have kild) a Horse: For if the winged Pegasus (like Mee) Had watred been, h'had had no eyes to see: Or if Bucephalus had trotted so, Hee had been lam'd and founder'd long agoe. Yet is my Task not done, for I must Play A Second Part before I have my Pay: Which Second Part shall to your view declare The Tavernes in ten Shires, and where they are; Within what County, in what Towne, what Signe, Or else (if not what Signe) who sels the Wine. The Counties are, Brave Barkshire, Hampshire, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Hartford, Middlesex and Sussex; With Buckingham and Oxford; these are they Which in my Second Part I must display. FINIS. Bull, Beare, and Horse, Cut, Curtaile, and Longtaile. VVith Tales, and Tales of Buls, Clenches, and Flashes. As also here and there a touch of our Beare-Garden-sport; with the second part of the Merry conceits of Wit and Mirth. Together with the Names of all the Bulls and Beares. This Dedication is directed, to his well-Affected and much Respected, his often Approved, and truly beloved, M?. Thomas Godfrey, Keeper of the Game for Beares, Bulls, and Dogges. Bull, Beare, and Horse, Cuts, Curtols, and Longtailes. Concerning Buls, sure no man is so Dull, Or ignorant, but that he knowes a Bull: There are more sorts of Bulls then Beares by ods, For Iupiter, (the chiefe of Heathen gods) Into a Bull, was pleas'd himselfe to Shape, When on Europa he committed Rape: And to a Bull, he turn'd his forme divine When he (on Ceres) got faire Proserpine. Taurus (the Bull) is if you wisely Note A Signe Cælestiall for the Necke and Throat, If any doubt of it, let them but go And buy an Almanacke, hee'le finde it so. Pasipha Queene of Creet, (a Royall Trull) Was monstrously enamour'd of a Bull: 'Twixt whom the Monster Minotaure was got, As in th'eighth Booke of Ovid it was wrot. But sure the stories truth is better fram'd, That sayes there was a man there (Taurus nam'd) Who was beloved of the lustfull Queene, And had with her too oft familiar beene. 'Tis said Semiramis (King Ninus Mother) Did love a Bull, which is as true as 'tother. When as Just Minos, (Creets victorious King) The Megarans did to's subjection bring, For which to Iove a feast he solemniz'd, Wherein a hundred Buls were sacrific'd. The Brazen Bull of Phallaris the Tyrant, Was such a Beast, as made the World admire on't, In which men Roasted, were to death Tormented, And he first suffred in't that it Invented. There dwels a man at Rome, that Buls can make, To make seduced Kings, and Kingdomes Quake, Which Buls (though Lead) (O wondrous to behold Are quickly Metamorphos'd into Gold. There's the Philosophers Admired Jemme, (That long sought Jewell, worth a Diademe) That hard, hard stone, which many men have sought And all they found, they found themselves worth nought; The Castle Angello, doth it Immure And there turnes drossy Lead, to Gold most pure. There are Bulbeggers, which fright Children much, There are Bull Taverns, that mens Wits will tutch; And further (for the Buls Renowne and fame) We had an ex'lent Hangman of that name. Suppose a man's match'd with a beauteous Wife, Who with an ugly Dwarfe defiles her life, To please her husband, she can fiddle, faddle, Whilst oftentimes a Monkey sits his Saddle, A man may say, that he most basely is Bull'd with an Urchin, through his Wifes amisse. And now of late a Bull's a Common Creature, For men (with nonsence) do speak Bull's by Nature, From East to West, from North unto the South, Bull's are produc'd each houre, by Word of Mouth. Which every day are brought unto the Printer, Faster then Mother Puddings made her Winter. To the decay of many a Tallow Taper, And the consuming many a Reame of Paper, Soft mault doth make sweet Fire, the Proverb sayes, Or else the Bull sayes so, you see which wayes. If men would use to Leape before they Looke, Bulls should not thus be thrust in many a Booke, For though Care may be Kill'd with any Cat, You are not sure the Fire is in the Fat, Fooles faine (say they) do often make faire Words, Yet some may Catch the Bush, some beat the Birds. But Better comes the seldome, I desire For My Kill set the Peck of Maulte on fire. This any man may, to himselfe apply That when the Larks fall, we may catch the skie. But if my Judgement do me not deceive I do esteeme it better lacke then leave. Though Brawne and Bacon breeds from Bores and Hoggs, Yet hungry Puddings will eat dirty Doggs. And sure a man had better bide away, Then come to late, A Faire after the Day. If such a one speed well, it is as rare, As tis To catch a Taber with a Hare. Which is as certaine as blind Fortunes Wheele, Or hold fast Like a wet Taile by the Eele. Let every man a true decorum keepe, Because tis ill, A waking Dogge to sleepe. And tis a Proverb throughout Christendome, That never One day was not built in Rome. If great men give me nothing, I say plaine, Ile hurle as much as that at them againe. He that stickes downe a Goose, and steales a Feather, Doth (by that match) not save, or profit neither. A long Corne for short harvest men may see, Like tedious woeing for a scornefull shee. Tis folly for a man to fall at strife With Women, who hath nine Cats like a life; For when the Gray-Horse is the better Mare, A Blinde man may be taken with a Hare. Spet in your hold, take better hands I say, We may be heere to Morrow, and gone to day. The man that angrie is without amends, Tis fit (without a cause he be made friends:) For though men know their Cattel by their marks The greatest men are not the wisest Clarkes. I purpose no mans credit to defame, But He that is halfe hang'd, hath no good name. Though all these Rimes are scarcely worth a Token The Water to the Pott goes till tis broken. Who cuts their fingers must abide them bleed, And when Geese preach, then let the Fox take heede. Tis hard to make me thinke, or late, or soone, That ever Greene Cheese was made of the Moone. Nor is it fit (as I doe understand) To put a mad Sword in a nak'd mans hand. A man may be a Drunkard or a Leacher, And yet mend as the Bolt doth mend the Fletcher. Or as the sowre Ale mends the Sommer, so A man (mistooke) may make his friend, his foe. For all this, 'tis not fitting to be book'd, How once olde Lincolne ore the Devill look'd. The Ancient Proverb still doth stand in force, Some better may looke one then steale a Horse. It may be some will not these lines allow, But then they take a wrong Eare by the Sow. Twas never yet a question in the Law, To stumble at a Blocke, leape ore a straw. But any man of simple wit may finde, That all this Corne hath shaken downe no Winde. He that will wrangle for an Egge thats Addle, Although he lose the Horse, may winne the Saddle. And thus my Muse, most lowly elevated, These English Proverbs hath to Bulls translated. More worthy, and Remarkeable observations of the Bull. As is before Repeated in my lines, Taurus (the Bull) 'mongst the Celestial Signes; So Taurus is a Mountaine, whose high Top Doth seeme to scale the Skies, and underprop The Bull that's stellified; That Hill doth Bound All Asia on the North, about it round Is many a Kingdome and large Continent, Which shewes the Bull is mighty in extent. A Bull's a Beast of State and Reputation, For he that eats Bull Beefe, (by approbation) With eating such strong meate, I do assure ye 'Twill puffe him up, and make him swell with fury. If any man will but himselfe examine, Hee'le find a Bull, a Buckler against famine, A Bull's a happy Creature, whence proceeds Most of the food, whereon most people feeds: He, and his sweet hearts (most beloved Kine) Yeelds thousands wherewithall to suppe and dine. The Calves, (his sonnes and daughters) plenteously With young and tender Veale, our wants supply. And from the Bull'd Cow, (in perpetuall motion) Milke flowes amongst us daily like an Ocean, Sweet Creame, and Cockney Curds they yeeld each day, And (for the poor) Whig, Buttermilk and Whay, Cheese Raw, or Toasted, or to Bait Mouse-traps, And Butter, to annoint the Flemmings Chaps, The Milk-Pans do allow, like bounteous Pooles, Meanes to make Cheese-cakes, Custards, Flawns, and Fools, And at the Milk-pale I have seene and heard Good Sullabubs, have been both made and mard. It is the Bull's Conjunction with the Cow (With blest encrease) that doth these things allow. Without the Bull we should be so unslor'd, The Kingdome could not yeeld a Posset Curd. Know then by this (good Reader) what a Bull is, And he that will not know it, but a Gull is. The Oxe (the Buls strong Eunuch son) is Chiefe Of Mortall meats, (man-feeding vigorous Beefe) And who so will amongst the Butchers seeke In London, and in Westminster each weeke, With those two Cities Bounds, and Liberties, With Countrey Butchers, and the great supplies That Market folkes do to those parts Impart (The Load of many a Horse, and many a Cart) The Beeves thus slaine, and eaten would appeare Above 3000, each weeke through the yeere. Chines, Surloyns, Flanks, Clods, Legs, doth fill us full, Brisket and Marrow-bones comes from the Bull; A Neats-tongue dri'd is deere, a Dish of State, At Stilliard any man may know the Rate. Innumerable are the people and families that live by the Bull and the Bulls off-spring. With many more things which Ile not Recite, 'Twould trouble men to Read, and I to write. Thus do the Butchers Thriue, the Grasiers Gaine, The Cooks and Victualers, do their states maintain, Sowse-wives grow plump and fat, and 'tis because Their sale is quicke for Muggets Paunches, Mawes, Tripes, Reads, Neatsfeet, Cowheels, &amp; Chitterlings, Whilst many thousands feed on Bag-puddings. Note but how well the Cheese-mongers do live, And what a usefull gainfull Trade they drive: Yet in their shops there is true Justice found The poore mans peney, and the rich mans pound Shall have true, weight according to proportion, Without conivence, falshood, or extortion. Were there no Buls, Chandlers were beggerd quite Nor could they sell our darknesse any light At any price of Reason, then our Guise Were soone to go to Bed, and late to Rise. Thus is the Bull, and the Bulls Breed descected In Flesh and Entrales; now my Quil's erected (In what is writ before I have not Lyde) And now Ile flourish ore the Hornes and Hyde. The Tanners wealth encreaseth day and Night, 'Till at the last his Sonne is dub'd a Knight: And Daughters should be (could they purchase pride) With Portions, and proportions Ladyfi'de. The Currier also needs not Curry favoure, For though his Trade smell, somethidg hath some savour. Nor would men be so mad as to prefer Their sonnes bound prentise to a Shoomaker; But that their future hopes do them perswade, It is no Bare-footed and Bootlesse Trade. Nor will it ever lack, or live in scorne, 'Till all our children without feet are borne; For (more then any Trade) hee'le sing and play, Whilst every Munday is his Holiday. And when a Shoomaker falls to decay, Hee'le be a Cobler new, and mend that way: But there's a monstrous Trade, of late sprung forth, Doth spoil more Leather then their skins are worth; The best Hydes they devoure, and Gurmundize, Which makes the worst in price too high to Rise; With them the World doth bravely run on Wheeles, Whilst poore men pinch and pay, quite out at heels. But hold, what vessell have I set a Broach, What is muse got jolting in a Coach? Out with a vengeance, walk on foot I pray And to the Bull again direct your way. Now for the excellent Admired Horne More profitable then the Unicorne. For Hoopes, for Spectacles, for Combs to dresse you (Which when they come so neere your heads, pray And 'tis a Bull I have heard often said (blesse you) Reach me the Iron Shooing Horne good Maid. And when the Hunted Stag bids life farewell, The Huntsmans Horn doth bravely Ring his Knell, Which was the Bull-calves, or the Buls-horns once Before the Gelder reft him of his stones. Thus from the Bull, and the Bulls Breed you see, A world of people still maintained be; He finds flesh, Bootes, Shooes, Lights, and stands instead And great importance to afford us Bread. The Bulls deare sonne (the Oxe) with daily toyle, Weares out himselfe with plowing and turmoyle, And all to find us bread, and when he dyes, His Flesh, Hyde, Hornes, and all our wants supplies. So much for Bulls now in particular, For our Beare-Garden Bull, a Bull of war, A stout, a valiant, and a Head-strong-Beast, Which did not fight this 18 Moneths at least; A Beast of mighty pollicy and power, That at his Dog foes will looke Grim, and Lower, Hee'le Knit the Brow with terror, in such sort, That when he chafes most, then he makes most sport; At push of Pike, he with his head will play, And with his feet spurne injuries away; Hee'l turne and wind as nimble as an Eele, And kicke, and skornes abuses with his Heele; Hee'le fling and throw, hee'le bravely tosse &amp; turn, Hee'le hurle and heave, and dangerously spurne, Note but his valour, when hee's at the stake, How he prepares himselfe the Dog to take: His feet fix'd fast, disdaining once to stirre, His wary eye upon the angry Cur. Whilst politickly with his Head he weaves, And with advantage up his foe he heaves, With such a force, that often with the fall Hee's dead, or lam'd, or hath no power to sprawle. Thus hath our Bull fought in his owne defence, And purchas'd (for his Master (Crowns and pence. And for that purpose may do so agen, (I wish I had the knowledge to know when) For since the time a Bull a Dog could tosse, Our Beare-Garden had never such a losse: But lets not lay the fault upon the Times, But let us blame our selves, and cease our Crimes. A Beare. Beare and forbeare, I now speake of the Beare, And therefore (Reader) give, or lend an Eare. First therefore, in much briefenesse I am rendring Where, and how Beares have breeding and engendring, Some are Ossean, some are Callidonian, Some Æremanthian Beares, and some Æmonian, Some rugged Russians, some Sun-burnt Numidians, And lastly, the white swimming Beares, (Amphibians) Some do affirme a Beare to be a creature, Whelp'd like a lump, with neither shape or feature, Untill the Damme doth licke it into fashion, And makes the lump a Beare in transformation. As Taylors with their precious wisdomes Tallants, Do licke, and Metamorphose Gulls to Gallantt. Whereby a fashion oft is shap'd (by chance) Out of an ill-bread lumpe of ignorance. But for the Beare he keepes his shape most constant, The Taylor (and his creatures) change each instant, The Beare keepes still, the fashion he brought hither, The gallant Gull's inconstant, like Weather. A Beare's a temperate Beast, most free from riot, A prudent Schoolmaster, of sparing dyet, Hee'le live foure moneths from every kind of meat, By sucking of his left foot, like a Teat. Which is an abstinence that doth require, More then the fast of a Carthusisian Fryer, No Capuchin, or immur'd Anchorite, Did never (so much) curbe his Appetite. And as Beares suffer hunger, I am sure, No beast created, doth more cold endure: When fridged Boreas blustring blasts do blow, Mid'st Rocks, of hoary Ice, and hills of Snow, The worst of Winters sharp extremity, The hardy Beare, abides most constantly. And in hot Africke, and the Libian Coast, Where Phæbus flames doth seeme the world to Roast: Where Negro Moores, are dride and blackly dide, That heat (excessive) there the Beare doth hide. So that with hunger, heat, and pinching cold, The Beares extremities are manifold. Being growne unto Maturity and strength, And having hither past the seas, at length, At Beare-Garden, (a sweet Rotuntious Colledge) Hee's taught the Rudiments of Art and knowledge. There doth he learne to dance, and (gravely grumbling) To fight &amp; to be Active (bravely tumbling) To practise wards, and postures, to and fro, To guard himselfe, and to offend his foe; Upon his hind feet, Tipto stiffe to stand, And cuffe a Dog off with his foot-like hand; And afterwards (for recreations sake) Practise to run the Ring about the stake. Whilst showts, and Mastives mouthes do fill the sky That sure Acteon ne're had such a cry. Thus Beares do please the hearing and the sight, And sure their sent will any man invite: For whosoer'e spends most, shall finde this favour, That by the Beares and Dogs, hee's made a favour. And as a Common-wealth, (oft by Ill-willers) Is vex'd by prowling Knaves, and Caterpillars, So is a Beare (which is a quiet Beast) By Curres and Mungrels, oftentimes opprest. And tyde to what he doth hee's bound to see, The best and worst of all their cruelty. And for mens monies, what shift ere they make for't, What ere is laid or paid, the Beare's at stake for't. Though he be hardly drawne to't 'gainst his will, Hee's bound to see and beare, and bide much ill; Besides the baiting of a Beare is rare, Unlike the baiting of a Horse or Mare: The Horse hath Provender, and Hey for Bait, And doth in peace and quiet eate his meat; When as the Beare, is Tugg'd, Lugg'd, Bit &amp; Beaten And eates no Bait, but likely to be Eaten. A Beare is like a Watchman by his coat, He weares a Rugge-Gowne alwayes (if you note,) And (like a Watchman) oft a Beare will be As mannerly, and watch as well as he. And as a grumbling Officer may weare A Collor and a Chaine, so doth a Beare. 'Tis writ by Authors (Philosophicall) How that a Beare is usefull, Physicall, For Agues, and hot Feavers, take his haire, His Greace (or Lard) will aking Limbes repaire: His Marrow strengthens, (if you do annoint) Shrunk Sinewes, Nerves, or an enfeebled joint, The oyle boyl'd from his feet will operate The Gowtes tormenting much to mitigate, And when man's in consumption, like to pine, The Bears pith's good, that grows amidst his Chine. A Beares skin Tann'd it'h haire, is for a bed Better then Blanquet, Rugg, or Coverled. A Beares Teeth, Painters in high price do hold, To make them Instruments to gild with gold, And for his Furre it is such ex'lent stuffe, That Many a Lady weares it in a Muffe; Dry a Beares Liver, and to Powder beat it, And let a Maid of forty five yeares eat it; Although a thousand false Knaves would deceive her Yet she shall keep her Maidenhead for ever. Thus having shew'd of Beares their sundry breeding Their formes, their admirable sparing feeding: Their patience, courage, temperance, fortitude, And many vertues that have them endu'd, For feare I should mens patience much offend, Ile give one short touch more and make an end. Then for the further honour of the Beares, They (with the stars) are mounted in their Sphears: There Vrsa Major in the firmament, Is stellifide, a glorious ornament, And there, the little Beare, (a starre more finer) Is call'd Artophilax, or Vrsa Minor, And who so reads the second part of Ovid, There shall they finde (what here is writ) approved. Now once againe, pray lend your eyes and eares, Ile write of baiting of the Bulls and Beares. It is a Game so ancient, that I wot Records can scarce shew when we usde it not. Except now, in these sad infectious times, That heav'ns just hand doth plague us for our crimes, The Game is by authority supprest; And Beares, and Bulls, and Dogs, have too much rest, Through want of baiting growne to such a straine, (Hard to be tam'd, or brought in frame againe) Almost all mad for want of exercise, Filling, the Aire with roaring and with cries, That those who neer the Bear-Garden are dwelling Do heare such bellowing, bawling, yawling, yelling, As if Hell were broake loose, or (truth to speake) The Devils at foot ball were on Barley-breake. There's three couragious Bulls, as ever plaid, Twenty good Beares, as er'e to stake was taid. And seventy Mastives of such Breed and Races, That from fierce Lions will not turne their faces; A male and female Ape (kinde Jacke and Jugge, Who with sweet complement do kisse and hugge, And lastly there is Jacke an Apes his Horse, A Beast of fiery fortitude and force. As for the Game I boldly dare relate, 'Tis not for Boyes, or fooles effeminate, For whoso'ere comes thither, most and least, May see and learne some courage from a Beast: And 'tis not only a base Rabble Crew, That thither comes, It may be proved true, That to the Beare-Garden comes now and than, Some Gamesters worth ten thousand pounds a man. For rough behaviour that's no great disgrace, There's more hors-play us'd at each deere hors-race, More heads, or legs, or necks, are broake each day, At Cards, Dice, Tables, Bowles, or foot-ball-play. The Game hath been maintain'd, and will, we hope Be so againe (now favour gives it scope) For Kings, for Princes, for Ambassadors, Both for our Countrymen, and forreigners. Which hath been held, a Royalty and Game, And (though ecclips'd) will be againe the same. But now (to make an end) must be explain'd, How it the name of Paris-Garden gain'd: The name of it was from a Royall Boy, (Brave Illions fire-brand, wracke and sacke of Troy) Paris (King Priams sonne) a sucking child, Was throwne away into the woods so wilde, There that young Prince was cast to lfve or perish, And there a Bear with sucke, the babe did cherish; And as a rare memoriall of the same, From Paris, Paris-Garden hath the name. Those that will not beleeve it, let them go To France, in Paris, they may find it so, Or if not there, let them looke narrowly, In Mathew Paris famous History. And that we have obtain'd againe the Game, Our Paris-Garden Flag proclaimes the same. Our Beares, and Bulls, and Dogs in former state, The streets of London do perambulate, And honest sport, and lawfull merriment, Shall thrice a weeke be shew'd, to give content. Vpon the goodnesse of a worthinesse of Horses, with a merry touch of the Beare-Garden Palfrey or Jacke-an-Apes his Horse. My Muse is Mounted 'twixt the soaring wings Of Pegasus, who bravely flies and flings Through ayre, through clouds, through sun-shine, &amp; descries Each earthly Regions Rare Varieties. The numbers infinite, of sundry creatures, Their strange diversity in formes and Natures, And as in gliding flight, I swiftly soare Or'e Sun-burnt Africke, and the Libian shore, There (with much pleasure) I did cast mine eye Upon the well-made Horse of Barbarie, And crossing or'e the Mediterran Maine, I saw the prauncing Jennet of proud Spaine, Straight the Iberian fume of Aristippus, Hurl'd us to Greece, and their I view'd their Hippos. Then back or'e Italy amaine we flew, Whereas their fierce Cavallo I did view, In Naples I the Courser brave espide, Thence, we or'e Almaine, and low Belgia glide, There my Muse saw the bounding Palfrey Prance, From thence my wing'd horse bore me over France There foaming fiery hot the gallant Gaul, Did daunce Corantoes with his Frenth Chevall. Then or'e Hibernia, we tooke speedy flight, And there the Irish Hobby pleas'd my sight, Then my Pegasian wings began to flag, I view'd the English Steed, and Scottish Nag. And as the heat of blood my Beast inflames He kick'd and threw me headlong into Pegasus cast me off his backe, and I fell into the Thames, which was the cause I serv'd an apprenticeship to be a Waterman. Thames, And as I fell, his hoofe bestow'd a wince Upon my pate, and there's the marke ere since. The gentle River at my fall did grieve, Set me on land safe, gave me meanes to live: And Pegasus inspir'd me with his heele, That ever since an itching vaine I feele, Of sprightfull Poesie, though not so well, As men may say I therein do excell. But I can do (as many more have done) Bring Reames of Paper to confusion. Nor doth my Muse rejoyce in merriments, Drawne from wits sorded obsceane excrements; Ile curbe her in, from medling with the State, Or libelling 'gainst men infortunate, I meane to keep my eares upon my head, And on mens miseries I scorne to tread. I have observ'd no proud man ever yet, Did any thing but ruine, and hatred get; I know obedience, and humilitie, Is best with all belov'd tranquilitie, I know the lawes guard me from mischiefes Jawes, Which lawes I love, &amp; those that made those lawes Nor shall my lines (for things indifferent) In Church or Common-wealth er'e make a rent. Thus Pegasus did to Pernassus soare, And on the Thames I got a healthfull Oare, Which ofttimes I have us'd, and will againe, Meane time Ile use the vigour of my braine, As Homer writ the warres of Mice and Frogs, So I (his Ape) do write of Beares and Dogs: Of Bulls, and Bulls begot by word of mouth Of Horses, and some Tales of age and youth, And now my Muse againe begins to mount, The Horses excellency to recount, You famous Palfreyes of the flaming Sunne, (That scorn'd the management of Phaeton) Who with the heat of Sol's bright Axelltree Caus'd all this under world on fire to be; (I know the morall meaning of the same, Is, man should not beyond true reason ayme.) Let Eous, Phlegon, Æthon, and Piruis, Apolloes golden Teame Assist my Muse, But 'tis no matter, keepe your daily course, Without your aide my wit is nere the worse; Whilst you are reeking with celestiall sweat I, of Terrestriall Horses meane to treat. A Horse (of all the Beasts beneath the skie) Is best, and most for mans commodity: His exact making gives the eye delight, A body brave, lin'd with a noble sprite, And though he knew no reson, or a mind, Yet unto man hee's tractably enclin'd, In dangerous war, the Horse the brunt doth carry, Where every Rider seemes a Sagitary, In peace, a Horse for state, for Tilt or Tourney, For quicke dispatch, or ease in any journey, For pleasure, carriage, and for husbandry, The Horse doth furnish our necessity. The poorest Horse that is, or ever was, Doth much more service then the golden Asse, Thats deck'd with borrowed trappings, yet such beasts, Advance audaciously their brainlesse Crests, Neere where the Princely Lyon doth resort, And there in pride and sensuall lust do snort, Yet can they not outstrip all beasts so farr, But Wisdomes eye perceives them what they are. The hunting Horse is of good use for pleasure. The Sumpter Horse doth understand the treasure. The Mill-horse hath an endlesse journey (round) The Pack-horse overladen measures ground, The Mare and Gelding serves our businesse well, Whilst (for poore Hackneyes) England is a Hell. And what's a Horses gaine for all his paine, But bread, grasse, hay, oats, or such kind of Graine, That is the summum bonum, he desires, Through want of which there's many a good Horse tyres. I have seene Gallants (three parts drunke almost) The bad usage of unconscionable riders to horses. Ride, as they meant to see the Devill in post, And when they to their journies end have come, Their horses mucky wet, with sweat and foame, The Riders fall unto their drinking vaine, The Ostler walkes the Horse a turne or twaine, Their jawes tyde up unto the empty Racke, The whilst their Riders smoake, and swallow sack, Quaffes, capers, sings a Katch, a round, or Ditty, And leaves the Horse unto the Hostlers pitty, And so the jades of meat do get such store, As Lazarus once had at the Gluttons dore. Thus many a good Horse proves a jade indeed Being over rid, and want whereon to feed, All those that to a beast beares such a mind, I wish them all so served in their kind. There's many wayes, mens barbarous cruelty, Doth cause diseases multiplicity To be in Horses, and the damned Trade To sell a Botch'd sophisticated jade, In Much cheating in Smithfield, in buying and selling Horses. Smithfield is in practice twice a weeke, He that beleeves me not, let him go seeke. There shall he see the ambler made to trot, The lame and founderd, lusty, (being hot) The trotter shall be forc'd with ease to amble, And through the horsemarket shall be such scamble With galloping, and trotting, ambling, pacing, Most odious swearing, lying, and out-facing, Such dawbing horses griefes with counterfeiting, That hee's a cuuning buyer scapes their cheating. In ancient times, horses much fame did gaine, Which Poets and Historians do maintaine: Besides the swift skie-scalding Pegasus, Great Alexander had Bucephalus, Reinoldo had his Bayard, and there are, Names giv'n to horses, both in peace and war. But leaving stately horses, it is found Vpon the Bearegarden Horse. The Bear-garden is circular, or rovnd, Where Iack-an-Apes his horse doth swiftly run His circuit, like the horses of the Snn. And quicke as lightning, his will trace and track, Making that endlesse round his Zodiacke, Which Iacke (his Rider) bravely rides a straddle, And in his hot Careere perfumes the saddle; Hee's active, and hee's passive in his pace, And sprung from ancient and approved race, His grandsires grandsire, was begot perforce, Between the Night-mare, and the Trojan Horse, That female Horse of Sinon, in whose wombe A hundred well-arm'd mad Colts had their roome, W?? being foald, spoild Troy, with sword &amp; flame, And from that Jade, our jade descent doth claime, For (as his parents oft have done before) He alvvayes keepes a jadish tricke in store. FJNJS. A sad and deplorable loving Elegy consecrated to the living memory of his best assured friend, the generally beloved, M. Richard Wyan deceased, late his Majesties Proctor for the High Court of the Admiralty. Who departed this life at his house at Bryl in Buckinhamshire, on thursday the 16. of August last. 1638. It may be good to live, but well to live Is such a Good, as few men can Achieve: The more we live, the more we do offend, The way to Heav'n's a good and speedy end: Th'Almighty Landlord (who doth all things sway, Doth let mans Soule a Tenement of clay, And Man is no Free-holder, but is still A Tenant only at the Landlords will. They are but Leafes, till our Lives expire, And thankes is all the Rent God doth require. And such a one was He, of whom I write, Who liv'd as euer in his Makers sight: Who day and night did humbly pay his rent Of thankes and praise for his fraile Tenement. Not only words, but reall deedes declar'd His love, His zeale, obedience and regard He ow'd to God and Man, to each degree His Heart, his Hand, his pen and purse were free. The poore mans Patron in distressed state, The rich mans patterne, how to imitate. Religion was His Pilot, and did steere His course of life, and all his actions here. With courage daily he did Death defie, His heart was fix'd on immortality; And one good precept, never he forgot, To use the World, as if hee us'd it not. Wherefore th'Almighty (in His gracious Doome,) Hath pluck'd him hence, from ills that are to come. The poore have greatest losse, they weeping know, He would not say God helpe, but help'd their woe. The State hath lost a Servant of great Trust, His friends haue lost a friend assured, just. His vertuous wife and children, great and small, Brother and sisters, kin, in generall Haue all receiv'd a losse, so great that we Can never hope that it repair'd shalbe. But I haue lost a friend, beyond a brother, For I nere had, nor shall haue such another. But here's our comfort, though grim Death assail'd him, His Faith, his trust, and confidence nere fail'd him: And though we all haue lost him, God hath found him, And with eternall happinesse hath crown'd him. Iohn Taylor. TRVTH'S TRIUMPH: OR, Old Miracles newly revived in the Gracious preservation of our Soveraigne Lord the King. ? Miranda canunt, sed vix credenda Poëtæ. Gods glorious, gracious Volume doth relate How (out of Nothing) He did All Create: Made man, True, Holy, Just, who (fowlely) fell And God Redeem'd him from sin, death, and hell: His Miracles of Judgment, fearefull, rare, His Miracles of Mercy Mighty are; Which makes my Muse this Miracle to Sing How graciously God hath preserv'd my King. The Ravens fed Elias in his need, And Hungry Daniel, Abacuck did feed, The Meale and Oyle, did every day encrease In Rich Aboundance, till the Dearth did cease, King David, oftentimes to flee was forc'd, And (like a Partridge or'e the Mountaines Cours'd, Th'Almighty still being their Great defence, Sav'de them from Famine, Sword, and Pestilence, And as these Miracles long Since were done, Yet God hath Lately shewed a Gracious one, Which proves my King th'Adopted son of God, Else he had Ruin'd beene, or downe beene Trod. For when Rebellion had the Land or'espread, And that the foot durst kicke against the Head; When each Fox had a Hole, each Bird a Nest And He no place his Royall Head to Rest; Depriv'd of Houses, Castles, Townes and Fortes, Of Shipping, Ammunition, Havens, and Portes, Of Powder, Shot, Guns, Pikes, onely one Sword Was Left him, which is Gods Eternall Word; Besides all this, his Magazins, his Tower, His Meanes, Rents, Customes, Ravish'd from his power, All his Revenues stopp'd, his Aides all staid, His Friends, and faithfull Subjects pris'ners laid, Or Banish'd, or undone, both they and theirs Whil'st Povertie's their Portions, and their Heires. His Antient Servants, (like poore sheepe forlorne) Despis'd and Look'd on with the Eyes of Scorne, Because they could not, or would not Maintaine. Disloyall warre against their Soveraigne. Nay more, His Gracious Queene (that Royall shee) Was for Her safety forc'd perforce to flee; What Wickednesse Could worse be Hatched then When He, that is the onely man of men, And She, the Woman for Her Vertues wonderd, So woefully should be divorc'd and sunderd. He whose Integritie's Admir'd Approv'd, She who deserves of all to be belov'de, A Blessed fruitfull Mother, and Thereby Her issue may the whole world dignify. He, should my pen presume his praise to write 'Twere like a Taper to give Phœbus Light; She, that in Princely vertues doth excell, In whom the Goddesses and Graces Dwell, In heart Heroicke, like the Thund'rers Bride, Like Citherea, She is Beautifide, Magnanimous, Like Ioves Brave Braine-Borne Girle In State and Minde of Maiesty the pearle. This Matchles Paire (with whom none may compare) By Rude, unruly Rebels sundred were. Their onely faults are, they are both too good For such as have their Goodnes thus withstood. A Milde Iosias will not serve their Turne, But Gracelesse they against his Mildnesse Spurne: A Nero, or an Heliogabalus Were fitter far, for Such as wrong'd him thus. His Blessed Raigne (from Cruelty exempt) Requited with disloyall Curst Contempt, Traduc'd in Pulpits, and in printed Lies, Abus'd with needlesse seares, and Jealousies; Tax'd, he would beare an Arbitrary sway, And turne Religion to the Romish way: In Conventicles, Sermons, Drinking, Walking, Or in discourse, Treason was safest talking. Besides all this (to all true Subjects Griefe) His never Broken Word gain'd no Beliefe, His Vowes, and Protestations, firme and Just (Which I account High Treason to distrust) All unbeleev'd, Misconstred, wrongly wreasted By false Surmise of men, Disloyall Breasted. No faith was Left 'em, doubtfull diffidence, Had Banish'd all Beleife, and confidence; God and the King, were both us'd in one fashion, The Creed was thrust out of the Congregation: The devill amongst them did such Whimseyes fling, They neither would beleeve God, or the King. For if they thought there were a God indeed, They then would know damnation is decreed In Scripture, for Resisting powers ordayn'd By God, which should be honour'd and maintain'd. It is a Maxime, hath beene alwaies held, The Protestant Religion ne're Rebell'd: Their Doctrine teaches humbly to obey, And, Whatsoever Seperatists can say, It plaine Appeares, they are not Protestants That ('gainst their King) uncivill Warres Advance. Thus did new Englands Sects Strive Impiously, To turne old England to an Anarchy. Thus was my Gracious Leige of all Bereft, And (in the world's opinion) little left; Then was he Rich in God, Then had he most, Th'Almighty Rais'd for him a mighty Hoste, Brave Armes, and Armies, in his Cause to fight, And set faithes true Defender in his Right. With Hope and Confidence hee's armed still, And humbly waites upon his makers will: With these he hath oppos'd false fortunes frownes, With these he hath Recover'd Strength and Townes, With these he hath got mony (warres strong nerves) With these Hee's serv'd because his God he serves. With these his Magnanimity hath won Triumphant Honours, that shall ne're be done. But Beyond Time his fame shall ever last, And he in blest Eternity be plac'd. All praise to thee, Eternall King of Kings, That coveredst Him with thy protectious wings With Such Miraculous Grace, that all may see My Soveraignes Safety All Consists in Thee. When as Assiria's King, (or th'Aramite) 'Gainst Israel came, with Numbers Infinite, 2 Kings. 6. 8.The Man of God (Elisha) did disclose The plots and purposes of Israel's foes. In Dothan then the Prophet did Reside, And Aram did a Mighty Host provide, And Seidg'd that Towne, (with terror much dismaid) Elishaes Servant also was afraid: Alas Master, How shall we do said He, The Prophet said, feare not, for with us be More then with them; Then did the Prophet pray His mans Mindes Blindnesse might be tooke away, And presently Such Sight did Him Inspire He saw his Master Compast Round with fire, And all the Mountaine full of wondrous forces Of Heavenly Soldiers, Charets, men and Horses. Elishaes Prayer did such favour find That all the Aramites were Strait Strooke Blind And so Captiv'd, their mighty Host did bring Into Samaria, unto Israells King. Againe the Prophet praid unto the Lord, And presently their Sights were all Restor'd, V. 20. With feare, they saw themselves environd Round, By those, whom they had purpos'd to Confound. Th'Assirians Being in this piteous plight, Quoth Israel's King (twice) Father, shall I Smite, The Prophet Answerd, I say Smite them not, Those with the sword whom thou hast Captive Got; Although they're foes they're men, opprest with greif, Give Bread and Water to 'em, for Releife. Then did the King Great preparations make, And (on his foes did much compassion take, He fed them, and in peace he sent them back Who came to be his Ruin and his Wrack. So, thus th'Almighty pleased his foes to tame, And Arams Bands no more to Israell came. V. 23. Thus unto Israel was deliverance given, Miraculously by the hand of Heaven. When Ammon Joynd with Moab, and Mount Seir, Good King Jehosophat to overbear. 2 Chr. 20. With Multitudes of Horse, and men of war, So that all Humane Hope, and Helpe was far. God then a Prophet rais'd who truly said, Stand Still Jehosaphat, be not dismaid, Behold the Lords Salvation, he hath spoak, The feild is thine, thou shalt not strike a stroake. Strait the mistakeing Ammonite (pell mell) Together by the Eares with Moab fell, Each, thought the other Judah's force to be In Bloudy Battaile deadly blows did flee. At last Mount Seir, (or th'warlike Edomite) Came in, and on them both, Renew'd the fight; The slaughter was so Great, that death was Cloyd, And thus Gods foes, themselves, themselves destroyed. Thus whilest they did each other overthrow, The King had victory and strooke no blow. My application of all this, is this, That God that ever was, for ever Is, He sav'd Samaria from the Aramites, And Just Jehosaphat from Ammonites, And from th'Incestuous brood of Moabites, And Esaus Rough-haird seed, the Edomites. The thoughts of Kings are open to his sight, And he doth know, King Charles his heart is right. By Miracles of old 'tis Manifest, Th'Almighty hath his wondrous power exprest; And Sure, the Miracle, God shew'd of late Is Admirable, Loving, Gracious, Great. The Kings own Subjects, His own servants too Pay'd, and gave Ayd, their Soveraigne to undo: With His own Weapons, Armes, and every thing. They, (in the Kings Name) warr against the King. Then, in that Low, unworthy exigent The Powerfull hand of the Omnipotent Raised him againe, to beat Rebellion downe, And to regaine againe, (in peace) his owne. When (like to Aram) our Blind Separatists Have Clear'd their Blear'd Eyes from Erroneous Mists, The Nose-wife Brownist Grauely doth begin To see the foolerie he hath liv'd in, The Anabaptist likewise hath found out How he hath gone the furthest way about. The Papist (as I hope) is quite past Hope That England shall be pester'd with the Pope, And every Idle Sect discountenanc'd, And onely Protestants true faith advanc'd, This God by Miracle for us hath don, And England Hath it's ancient glory Won. Prophetically true, I hope these Lines Of mine will prove, for (as my Soule divines) The Lord these things to passe will shortly bring, And God, for ever Blesse and Save the King. FINIS.

      <field name="fulltext">FOURTH COLLECTION TAYLORS ARITHMETICKE, From One to Twelve. 0 00 000 0000 00000 000000 In the first line, you Cyphers onely see, 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000. But (adding one) they more then Cyphers be; And take that one from them, what are they then? Just nothing (Cyphers) as they were agen. So some who were but Cyphers in estate, One set before them rais'd them to some rate, To tens, to hundreds, thousands, thousands ten, From Cyphers unto millions, mounted men. One Rais'd up numbers, numbers layd one low; Thus (with Vicissitude) goes weale and woe: Now that one's gone, some are left bare and poor, Just nothing, Cyphers; wanting One before. And is it but for One we make this moan? (Before us now are many more then One) But One did make me something, then I had Supportance from One, to be fed and clad; But many (many sinnes) a Cypher made me: Just nothing (nothing) ten yeares hath been payd me. Coyne is mans earthly life, lifes Nerves and Sinnewes, And I should have some from the Crowns Revenues, For which I've su'd, and su'd, but have it not; The fault's not mine, tis my unlucky lot. And I might seek again (if I were mad) And have as much as formerly I had. Were I as free from want, as cleare from hate, I would not with an Alderman change state: But cares, and wants, in Troups Assault me thick, Past numbring with my poore Arithmetick. Thus upon One a little I have playd, Yet more of One a little must be said. The Fathers One, One likewise is the Sonne, The Holy Ghost One, and all 3 but One. One Faith there is, (he that hath two hath none) And in the Firmament One Sun, One Moone. Man hath One soule, One Corps, One head, One brain, One tongue, One heart, (some very Knaves have twain) One Life, (one span) if one inch more it be, It stretches to unmeasur'd misery: The World's but one, and that's a Cipher Round, And nothing but a Cipher twill be found, All shall lose, All do lose, all have lost, Who shall, doth, hath, the false world trusted most. If in Jerusalem One man had bin, That had lov'd God, and striv'd to shun all sin, Th'Almighty on them would compassion take, And spare the City for that one mans sake; But as the Psalmist truly made his moane, The Lord beheld none doth good, no not ONE. On the number 2.Two Natures the most High, most Blest did beare, The Godhead great, and Manhood pure and cleare, Man hath two substances, both soyl'd, and fowle, (A body cloy'd with crimes, a sinfull soule) He hath 2 Eyes to see, 2 Eares to heare, Two hands to work, 2 legs the rest to beare, He hath 2 choises, Life, Death, good, or ill, (Yet hath no free will to chuse which he will) He that can only will and do, can arme Mans will to chuse the good, and shun the harme. Two Lives, 2 Deaths, 2 temporall, two eternall, Two wayes from hence, Cœlestiall, and Infernall. I could speak more of 2, and more of one, But 3 calls for me, and I must be gone. On the number 3.Three is the Blessed Trinity, and I Do beg the Blessing of that Trinity. Three times the Apostle Paul with rods was beaten 2 Cor. 11. 25. And 3 times suffred Shipwrack, death did threaten Three are the Graces Theologicall, (Or Vertues call'd Divine Cœlestiall) Faith is the Creed, and who so holds that fast Hope (the Lords Prayer) Gods Gift will Crown at last, 2 Thess. 2. 16. And Charity obediently presents Her service in the ten Commandements: These 3 are th'Handmaides of salvation; These guide men what to doe, or leave undone. The 4 Evangelists, the Story pen'd Of him who nere began, and ne're shall end: On the number 4. His low descending, his high Pedigree, His Innocence, wondrous works, and misery, His suffrings, and his bitter Death and Passion, To free poore Sinners from deserv'd Damnation. Foure Vertues Cardinall, Justice, Fortitude, Prudence, and Temperance, these 4 include: All mans perfection here, from these proceeds Th'effects of our best thoughts, our words, and deeds. Foure quarters of the world, are Asia, With Affrick, Europe, and America. Foure Windes ('mongst thirty two) are most exprest, North, Sols East rising, South, and Sun-set West. Foure seasons round about the year doth bring, The Summer, Autumne, Winter, and the Spring. Foure Elements, Fire, Water, Earth are three, And th'Aire (unseen) which no man ere did see. Foure dispositions, Drye, Moist, Hot, and Cold. Foure strange Complexions (humorous manifold,) Intemperate, Sanguine, Lazy Phlegmatick, Sad, mad, melancholy, Rash, Cholerick, And various mixtures of those 4 Complexions, Possesseth us with contrary affections; And which of these 4 humours are most in us, The same to Vice or Vertue still doth win us; And were there not worse Knaves then 4 ith' Cards, I mean no Dukes, or Dons, or Lords, or Lards) The grieved peoples plaints had not been such, And Englands miseries not half so much Thus having done with 4, I think it meet. To fall to work on 5 to fill my sheet. On the number 5.Blest He (whose Grace and Glory hath no bounds) For's Enemies receiv'd 5 mortall wounds. Curst He that with both tongue and teeth doth teare That glorious name, and by those Wounds doe sweare And forsweare too, those cursed sonnes of Caine, Doe crucifie Christ every day againe. He that's the Bread of life, the living Bread, He that five thousand men with five loaves fed, He whom 5 Virgins wisely waited on, Mat. 25. With Oyle in Lamps: 5 foolish ones had none. Five sences in our bodies he hath plac'd, To Heare, to See, to smell, to Touch, to Taste; But all those sences senceles men doe use, The Gracious giver of them to abuse. Men never more cruell mercilesse, Never more Pride, or vaine voluptuousnesse; Hypocrisie is mask'd in Robes of Zeale, And Avarice preyes on this Nations weale. Blinde Fortune (in her Wisedome) thought it fit, To give some all, and many ne're a whit; Though times are dangerous for an honest man; With Gods help I'le passe through all as I can. And thus my fingers 5 doe make an end With 5, because on 6 I must attent. On the number 6.Sixe I'le be breef with, for my minde I fixe, To write more large of 7, and short of sixe. Six dayes th'Almighty did preordinate, To be the time the whole world to create: He said but Let there be, and every thing Was made for man, and he made man sole King Of all the Creatures, but he quickly fell, He against God Rebel'd, all things Rebell Against him for it, h'hath lost both Grace, and place, In Paradice, and all his wretched Race Unto his sinne Originall are Heires, Increas'd still with the actuall sinnes of theirs, For which the Curse was, Man his bread should eate, With 6 dayes work in 7, with toyle and sweat. Since the Creation still (from Age to Age) On the number 7. Seven is a number of most high presage: Amongst all dayes the seventh was chiefest blest, A resting Sabboth, type of endlesse Rest. The Plannets (in their Revolutions) seven. The 7 stars in the Firmament of Heaven. Pharaohs 7 (dream'd) leane Kine devowr'd 7 fat, And want and plenty Joseph found by that. Gen. 41. Yea more then forty times Leviticus As the 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 25. Doth in 6 Chapters mention 7 to us. Six times Eliah's man went out in vaine, 1 Kings 18. 44. He went the seventh time, and brought newes of Raine. Seven Priests, 7 times did with 7 Trumpets blow, And then fell downe the Walls of Jericho. 6. Josh. King David 7 times every day did praise Psal. 15. 164. The Lord for's Judgements just, and righteous waies. Th'Assyrian Naaman (at the Prophets word) Did wash himselfe 7 times in Jordans Ford, Because he did the Seers command obey, 2 Kings. 5. His loathsome Leprosie was cur'd straightway. The Widdowes 7 sonnes in the Maccabees, 2 Macc. 7. In lives, and deaths Renown'd for constancies. Petitions 7 taught by our Lord Supernall, Include all blessings, temporall and eternall. Christ (in compassion) in his Passions griefe, Spake 7 sweet words to the believing Thiefe; Then he who payd our great Redemptions price, Said, This day shalt thou be in Paradice: Luke 23. 43. These 7 words were Cœlestiall Gileads Balme, Mid'st stormes of Death and Hell, a blessed calme. One said to Christ, shall I forgive him free, That hath done 7 offences against mee? The answer was, those that will happy live, Must 7 and seventy times (and more) forgive: Thus Seven times seventy plainly doth expresse, If man remit, God quits sinnes numberlesse. Seven Asian Churches in the Revelation, Rev. 1. Seven Angels in them to preach mans salvation. Seven golden Candlesticks, with heavenly light, To guide us from the wrong way to the right: These sevens and many more each man may view, In Gods two Testaments, the old and new. Man hath seven Ages, first his Infancy, Puerillity, Mans state, Youth, Gravity, Old age, and state decrepit, these seven are, From Birth to buriall our appointed share; And every seaventh yeare we may justly call Our lifes division Climactericall: And nine times seven, of yeares are sixty-three, Mans dangerous Age, and death, as oft we see. And ten times Seaven amounts to seventimes ten, Just Davids spanne the Common Age of Men: Thrice seven yeares past that time, some may survive, Till griefe and sorrow unto death them drive. Seven are the Sciences, so call'd indeed, Because from them all other Arts proceed. Seaven are the deadly sinnes, whose Root and stem Grew first in Hell, and all sinnes else from them. Seven were the wisest men ere Gotham had; But England hath seven thousand sevens as mad. Seven Sages once in Greece Renown'd, admir'd, For wisedome (in these times not much desir'd.) Rome once had seven wise Masters, they are dead, Seven thousand Knaves and Fooles left in their stead. Seven wonders had the World since it began; But the eighth wonder were a righteous man. Seven Saxon Kings this Kingdome once obey'd, But ne're had Peace till one the Scepter sway'd. Of Sacraments the Roman Church hath seven: Here onely two directs the way to Heaven. A holy Prophet long agoe foretold, Seven women should upon one man take hold; Isay 4. 1. Which Prophesie is very neere fulfilld, By bloody wars thousands of men are kill'd. By Sea and Land Death doth to men befall, Besides the common way that's naturall; Males are in multitudes of life bereft, That one man for seaven Women's scarcely left. The seaven Electors, at an Emperours choise, Are seven to make up a prevailing Voice. Seaven yeares Apprentiship the Law ordain'd, Whereby men have their freedoms here obtain'd. When the old world was drown'd, 8 then surviv'd, On the number 8. And from those 8 the new World was deriv'd. Tis plainly and undoubtedly exprest, On the number 9. Nine sorts of People certainly are best. Matt. 5. Ingratitude 9 Leapers did defile, Luke 17. Their Leaprosie was not so loathsome Vile. Nine are the Muses and the Poets blisse, They make him sing, his minde a Kingdome is; But in that Kingdome's not one foot of ground, Or any thing esteem'd if it be found; The pur-blinde world, and Fortune holds it fit, That Reverend wealth should make a Foole of Wit; Because each Poet wants a good Mecenas, I live and lack, and wander like a leane Asse. The 10 Commandements, are the Law Divine, On the number 10. (To keep those Lawes, Good Lord our hearts incline;) But from those 10, should 10 men each pluck one, Tis to be feard that left we should have none. The Atheist (which the Psalmist foole doth call) Psal. 14. As he believes will have no God at all. Th'Idolater will stock, block, Idols have To save him, though themselves they cannot save. The Roarer that delights to damne and sweare, From the Commandemants he the third would teare, The Sabbath-breaker would pluck out the fourth, The fifth (with Rebels) is of little worth, The sixth the Murtherer would stab and wound, The seventh the hot Adult'rer would confound, The Thiefe would steale the eighth away, and then False Witnesse spoile the ninth: and for the ten, The Wretch thats Covetous would rend and bite, And pluck the rest in pieces if he might. Thus would these 10 (this cursed Catalogue) Each race out one, and spoyle the Decalogue. On the number 11.Man seemes to know (by Art and study great) Eleven long steps from th'Earth to Gods blest seat: The first step to the Moone, and secondly, He mounts unto the sphere of Mercury: The third staire he to Venus Orbe doth soare: And fourthly, to the Sunne make one step more: The fifth to Mars, the sixth to Jupiter: The seventh to Melancholy Saturns sphere: Eighthly to th'fixed stars h'ascends on high: And ninthly to the Primum Mobile: The tenth step to the Heav'n cal'd Christalline: And last, where never ending glories shine. Here's knowledge with mans Ignorance so tainted, He nothing knowes, nor with himselfe's acquainted. On the n?ber 12.Twelve Patriarks, 12 Prophets, and 12 Tribes, These sacred twelves the holy Writ describes. Twelve Gates hath heavenly new Jerusalem, Revel. 21. Each Gate's a whole Perle (vnvalued Jem:) Twelve thousand furlongs, the Walls are, foure square, And in each square 3 of those Pearle Gates are. Twelve Angels, 12 Apostles, 12 Foundations, That all Believers from all Lands and Nations May enter there, from North, South, East, and West, And there be glorifi'd with endlesse Rest: God grant the Writer, and this Reader may Keepe there an everlasting Holy-day. Those blessed Twelves, in 12 lines I have pen'd, And thus my poore Arithmetick doth END. A MOST LEARNED AND Eloquent Speech, spoken (or delivered in the Honourable House of Commons at VVestminster,) by the most Learned Lawyer Miles Corbet Esquire, Recorder of great Yarmouth, and Burgesse of the same, on the 32 day of July last, taken in short hand by Nockey and Tom Dunne his Clarkes, and revised by John Taylor.

If any aske, what things these Monsters be, Tis a Projector, and a Patentee: Such, as like Vermine or'e this Land did crawle, And grew sorich, they'gaind the Devill and all. Loe I, that lately was a Man of Fashion, The Bug-beare and Scarcrow of this Nation, T'h admired mighty Mounte-banke of Fame, The Juggling Hocus-Pocus of good name, The Bull-begger, who did affright and feare, Now Time hath pluck'd the Vizard from my face, I am the onely Image of disgrace. My ugly shape I hid so cunningly (Close cover'd with the cloake of honesty) That from the East to West, from South to North, I was a man esteem'd of ex'lent worth. And (sweet Sir Thomas Dodger) for your sake, My studious time I spent, my sleepes I brake, My braines I tost, with many a strange vagary, And (like a Spanniell) did both fetch and carry, To you, such Projects, as I could invent, Not thinking there would come a Parliament. I was the Great Projector, and from me, Your Worship learn'd to be a Patentee, I had the Art to cheat the Common-weale, And you had tricks and slights to passe the Seale. I tooke the paines, I travell'd, search'd and sought, Which (by your power) were into Patents wrought. What was I but your journey-man, I pray, To bring your worke to you, both night and day: I found Stuffe, and you brought it so about You (like a skilfull Taylor) cut it out, And fashion'd it, but now (to our displeasure) You fail'd exceedingly in taking measure. My legs were Screwes, to raise thee high or low, According as your power did Ebbe or Flow. And at your will I was Screwd up too high That tott'ring, I have broke my necke thereby. For you, I made my Fingers fish-hookes still To catch at all Trades, either good or ill, I car'd not much who lost, so we might get, For all was Fish that came into the Net. For you (as in my Picture plaine appeares) I put a Swines face on, an Asses cares, The one to listen unto all I heard Wherein your worships profit was prefer'd. The other to tast all things, good or bad (As Hogs will doe) where profit may be had. Soape, Starch, Tobacco, Pipes, Pins, Butter, Haye, Wine, Coales, Cards, Dice, and all came in my way, I brought your worship, every day and houre, And hope to be defended by your power. Sir Thomas Dodgers Answer. Alas good Tenter-hooke, I tell thee plaine, Too seeke for helpe of me tis but in vaine: My Patent, which I stood upon of late, Is like an Almanacke that's out of Date. 'T'had force and vertue once, strange things to doe, But now it wants both force and vertue too: his was the turne of whirling Fortunes wheele, When we least dream'd we should her changing feele. Then Time, and fortune, both with joynt consent Brought us to ruine by a Parliament: Which now I find were but alluring baits, And I (to much an Asse) did lend my eare, To credit all thou saydst, as well as heare. Thou in the Project of the Soape didst toyle, But 'twas so slippery, and too full of oyle, That people wondred how we held it fast, But now it is quite slipp'd from us at last. The Project for the Starch thy wit found out, Twas stiffe awhile, now limber as a Clout, The Pagan weede (Tobacco) was our hope In Leafe, Pricke, Role, Ball, Pudding, Pipe, or Rope. Brasseele, Varina, Meavis, Trinidado, Saint Christophers, Virginia, or Barvado; Bermudas, Providentia, Shallowcongo, And the most part of all the rest (Mundungo) That Patent, with a whiffe is spent and broke, And all our hopes (in fumo) turn'd to smoake. Thou framdst the Butter Patent in thy braines, (A rope and butter take thee for thy paines) I had forgot Tobacco-pipes, which are Now like to thou and I, but brittle ware. Dice run against us, we at Cards are crost, We both are turn'd up Noddies, and all's lost. Thus from Sice-sinke, we'r sunke below Dewce-ace, And both of us are Impes of black disgrace. Pins pricke us, and Wine frets our very hearts, That we have rais'd the price of Pints and Quarts. Thou (in mine eares) thy lyes and tales didst foyst, And madst me up the price of Sea-coales hoyst. Corne, Leather, Partrich, Pheasant, Rags, Gold-twist, Thou brought'st all to my Mill, what was't we mist? Weights, Bonlace, Mowstraps, new, new, Corporation, Rattles, Seadans, of rare invented fashions, Silke, Tallow, Hobby-horses, Wood, red-herring, Law, Conscience, Iustice, swearing, and For-swearing. All these thou broughtst to me, and still I thought, That every thing was good that profit brought, But now all's found to be ill gotten pelfe, I'le shift for one, doe thou shift for thy selfe. John Taylor. Finis. Englands Comfort, and Londons Ioy: Expressed in the Royall, Triumphant, and Magnificent Entertainment of our Dread Soveraigne Lord, King Charles, at his blessed and safe returne from Scotland, on Thursday the 25. of Novem. 1641. Verses Presented to his Majesty. When Israel with Judah did contest, Which of them ought to love King David best; Iudah claim'd Kindred of the King, and said 2 Sam. 29. 41. 42. That he (by Right) should still with them have staid: But Isr'el boldly to them straite reply'd, That David (onely) was with them t'abide; And that in him they had ten parts, (at least) And therefore had most Right and Interest. These words caus'd wicked Sheba, (Bichri's Son) Most madly to rebellious Armes to run; But Sheba's head, which first contriv'd those jarrs) Chap. 20. Was lop'd, and so was ended all the warrs. I wish Great Britaine the like Song to sing In love, who best shall love and serve the King: Let Sheba's head be lost, and let us be, England, and Scotland, both in Vnity. Hee's Ours and Theirs, and he is Theirs and Ours, Let's love and serve him, with our Prayers, and Powers; That as the King is one, so we as one May praise God, for establishing his Throne. When He, (our Svnne of joy) from us set forth His Raies illustrious, lightned all the North: Whilst sighes like Clouds, and showers of Teares &amp; Cares, Was Londons, and faire Englands Southerne shares. But this returne our sadnesse doth destroy, Our Teares of griefe are turn'd to Teares of joy; Our Night of woe, we patiently endur'd, Our Mornings joy is come we are assur'd. Hee's come to salve this Kingdomes discontents, To cure all wrenches, fractures, spraines and rents, Where Church, and Common Wealth is dislocated; And all good men amazed and amated. Gods Great Lieutenant, foure great Kingdomes King, No doubt but he those mischifes downe shall ding To Hells blacke Vault, from whence they first assended, And with a blessed pleace, all strife be ended. Verses presented to the Kings own Hand by Iohn Taylor. In Ovids Metamorphosis I finde Transformed Formes, and strange mishapen Shapes; Of humane transmutations from their Kind To Wolves, to Beares, to Doggs, to Pyes, to Apes; Yet these were but Poeticall escapes, (Or Moralizing of unnat'rall deeds) To shew that Treasons, Murders, Incests, Rapes, From Beastiall minds, (in humane formes) proceeds But through thy power (which my poore Muse inflames) A greater Wonder is perform'd by me: I have transform'd a Boat from off the Thames, Vnto a Horse, to come to welcome thee. And now thy Gracious sight I doe attaine, Ile turne that Horse into a Boat againe: And all whom thy returne doth not delight, Let them be hang'd, and then they have their right. FINIS. A Reply as true as Steele, To a Rusty, Rayling, Ridiculous, Lying Libell; which was lately written by an impudent unsoder'd Ironmonger and called by the name of An Answer to a foolish Pamphlet Entituled, A Swarme of Sectaries and Schismatiques. The Divell is hard bound and did hardly straine, To shit a Libeller a knave in graine. VVhat Dogs Infernall Snaps and Snarleth thus? (Begot by Tripleheaded Cerberus) No 'tis a pretty Puppy, with one head, A Red haird whelpe, that can both Write and Read, Sprung from the devill and a mad Dun Cow, Nurse in a Dunghill where he suck'd a Sowe, This Amsterdam'd cur, hath strange Libels flirted And much fowle Inke besquitterid and Besquirted That everywhere his Roguish Pamphlets flies That England's all embrodred o're with lies. And late this cankerd viperous hownd of hell His toadlike mallice did against me swell, And did a poysnous lying libell frame Against me, but durst never set his Name. An Annagram Denominotes him well Three scurvey words, a KNAV, REVILER, HEL, Look into the tenth line following and there in Capital letters you shall finde that these three wicked words are his Anagram. These shew his name, his nature and his end (Except before hee's hang'd he meanes to mend.) For who is fitter for black hell to have Then a reviler and a railing Knave, And not to hold you in suspence much longer This fellow is a Quondam Iron-monger And now his coppies Chaung'd, crackd Like a shell In Gracious street, doth Graceles libells sell. If I would be an Idle babling talker Perhaps I then should name him HENRIE WALLKER. But 'tis no matter, I'le awhile forbeare Hee'l hang himself if I should name him heere; He in his title page, six times sets down My name, but never once, durst write his own And though his libell be one Sheete (no more) And Prose and Verse the lines are but eightscore, Yet fifty of these Roguish lines (pray know it) He stole from FENNER, the dead Rimeing Poet. And yet the mungrill Dogg's wits was to seeke That he was faine to pumpe Above a weeke. To answer me, but this reply was soon unwrit and writ in halfe an Afternon. And what sweet stuffe his Giant muse brought forth Those that will reade may quickly know the worth. He layes about him bravely with his Inke And taxes me with drabs and to much drinke But those that know me well, do know me so That I to both those vices am a foe, But were I given to the veneriall crime I would have seen his wife before this time, If he be Iellious, he deserves for that To wear a faire Ox-feather in his Hat; The Rascall sayes that I was invited to dinner, at the Tower it is knowe I was a Servant there 14 yeeres.Th'Archbishop nor his men did me invite Nor for a meal did I the book endite For 'tis to sundry gentlemen well knowne That I did write that booke three yeares agone. Let trencher knaves (like Walker) Scrape for scrapps And with the snuffes of Greatmen Rince their chappes, No Bishops not in England living be That I have cause to thanke for gifts to me. He that takes part with Rome, let him have Hell And there is Roome enough, there let him dwell: But though those lines may shew sincerity Yet they are far from Christian charity,) I hate no person, (Layman or Divine) Nor 'Gainst misguided soules do I repine, I hate mens crimes, no do I love mine own, (And charity begins at home 'tis knowne) As men transgresse, so punish the offender As men are men so men should pitty tender; This shallow pated foole that railes and raves, I pitty him and all his brother knaves Sure if they had wit they would descry Good manners must not be Idolatry, That Popery is not railes, though too much railing Hath shewed Romes mingle mangle wrangling failing. Thou filthy fellow, dost thou make no ods Between a Stable and a House of Gods, I thinke the devill feares that doomes day's neere And therefore he those adverse Sects doth reare And Buzzeth sundry formes of strange Religions That he may catch the most of them like Widgeons; For what a lamentable case is this When such mad fooles (whom wisemen scorne and hisse) Dares take upon them to reforme and teache Various Relligions, all beyond their reach. And this rare Rascall, (in his zeale discreet) Went lately to the Owle that's in Kings street There was his Bible paund (for what I pray) For one quarte of Metheglin left to pay. Was not this Rogue rap'd with some spright devine To pawne Gods word for poor Welch Muscadine. He talkes of whipping, and of Iayles to me Of gallowses, and things called Pillorie, And such od whimsyes, which the Gentleman Doth hammer in his Perricranian, Yet late Greatmen of Government thought fit To clap him in the fleet with all his wit, And being thence releas'd, he afterward Was kept in Wood-street-Counter with good guard For why it vvas a matter most unmeet His precisous Pamphlets should bestrow the street And make some old men, that for got almost To ride a Horse, to ride each Pissing Poste, And all his patience could not be content To stay for order from the Parliament, I hold it manners to forbear a while Till that High Court our wrongs can reconcile To wait with patience, and with prayers desire That God that Blessed Senate would inspire With Grace, true wisdom, courage, saving health For Heavens Great-service, King and common wealth. But Master Walker and such Knaves as he To wait their leasures cannot quiet be: But they must Libell raile, and keep a Rut, And (as they please their own wayes out to cut, And like unmannag'd wild untoward Iades Lay by their laudable and lawfull Trades, And sawcily to preach, prate, rore, and lie Against all order rule and descencie; And all such as are not seditious To call them Papists, and idollatrous, As Froggs and Toades do breed from Putred slime So do these Vermine feed upon mens crime Like Swine ith' mire, they love to wallow in The Sordid Loathsom Excrements of Sin. And though offenders suffer worthily Yet will these varlets malice never die, For though unhappy Strafford be struck dead They mount him up a cock-horse sans a head. And this most precious youth, with tongue and pen Is chiefe amongst the devills serving men, For with his serpents tongue and poysned breath He doth his worst to torture after death, And sure because thou canst do Ill so well Thou must expect to have thy hire in hell, This stinking Vermin (mounseir overthwart) Quite oposite to Nature, Law and Art, Holds it not fit he should be kept in awe Within the Rules and limmits of the Law, And therefore if the Law should bid him stand Then he would kneele, (contrary to command) And when to kneele, good manners holds it fit In opposition he would stand or sit; For nothing his rebellious minde contents That is not mix'd with disobedience A sister as she chancd to set her eye on The Kings Armes in the Church, the Rampant Lyon, She said his Priap mov'd unlawfull motions Which did disturbe and hinder her devotions, But when her husband came to be Church warden He caus'd some formes of flowers from field or Garden Or sedge and flagges, 'twixt the Beast legges be painted To hide his whim wham, which her minde had tainted. This was done really, and 'tis no fable To prove it so I quickly can be able, And now thou poysoned pickthank pestilent That writ'st and Rimest so poor so violent Me think this my reply may answer thee, If not, th'art like to have no more of me I scorne and loath, that e're my pen or tongue Should write or speak to such a lump of dunge; Yet thou, (well skild in foolish impudence) 'Gainst these retorting lines will take offence And with Mockado mouth and judgement Rash, And tongue of Saye, thou'lt say all is but trash, And that 'tis pitty, I should thus disperse A businesse of such consequence in verse, Indeed, with thee it cannot stand for good Nor can it well by thee be understood, Thou hat'st the muses, yet dost love to muse In railing tearmes thy betters to abuse, Verse must have method, measure, order, feet, Proportion, cadence, weight and number, sweet But thou that hat'st good verse, and libels make Dost with the Devills cloven foot thy measure take And where thou hast no power thou dost deride (so will all Rogues that verse cannot abide) But let such know, that heaven bred Poetry Despiseth mundane poore fellicity, Nor for Vaust ayre will like a mag-py Chatter, Or for the Crummes of greatnes Lye and flatter, I could write lines, (thou fowle ill looking elfe) Should make thee (in Jambicks) hang thy selfe, Th'art fowle within, and my sharp lancing quill Can make Incision, and with Art and skill Search deep for dead flesh and Coroded Cores And from corruptions cleare and clense thy sores. Th'art almost Gangren'd, and I surely think No Ballsums better then a Poets Inke, My pen can lash detraction and I can Be valliantly bold, and wrong no man, But wherefore (like a Mountebank) doe I Spend time and Ink upon such rascall frye As is this gad-flye. 'Tis not Sergeons Art Can help him, it perhaps may make him smart. But he will be uncured, as he hath bin Except he first be Cleansed and purged within: So, Walker, Walk Knave, and more Roguery brew And farewell and be hangd, that's twice adiew. FINIS. THE HELLISH PARLIAMENT Being a COUNTER-PARLIAMENT To this in England, containing the Demonstrative Speeches and Statutes of that Court. Together with the perfect league made between the two hellish Factions the Papists and the Brownists. The verse has been extracted from prose text. [Thus wicked Satan hath a double way] Thus wicked Satan hath a double way, To worke his ends to hinder his decay, His Agents are so many and so wicked bent, They care not for the truth so they'r not shent; If that the Lions skin will doe no good, They'l soone put on the cunning Foxes hood. England repent, and for this Parliament pray, Sith th'Devill strives to hurt thee every way. FINIS. A Delicate, Dainty, Damnable DIALOGVE, Between the Devill and a Jesuite. Devill. My Deere Adopted Son, since we are met And in our serious consultation set, Let us contrive some stratagem most fit, Our Antient Greatnesse, and deep-searching witt, Lets lay such plots, may make the World admire, And ad more fuell to our endlesse fire. Iesu. An't please your Gracelesse Maiestie to note That I, with all the Brethren of my Coate, Have been the truest Servants unto you, Wee hold it Iust to give the Devill his due, Wee have from North to South, from East to West, Survaid the World, and wee have done our best In every Province, Realme and Monarchie T'advance and raise the Papal Dignitie, And raising That, we understand right well, Wee doe enlarge your Antient Kingdome Hell. Devil. Though Truth and I did ever disagree, Yet truth I must say, that the Iesuites be My deerest Servants, they have ever been My Actors, and my factors (soules to winne) But now our Cunning is found out, and crost, And if wee look not to't, all will be lost. Iesu. Your Hellhood cannot taxe us (Mighty Prince) With sleepy idlenesse, or negligence: Wee have adventured oft in dangers deepe, To lull the King of Christendome asleepe, We have made Spaine for us, and Italie, Poland, and the greatest part of Germanie, Hungaria, Russia, France, all Catholikes, (Except a crew of wilfull Hereticks) Such as will not by our perswasions come, And be obedient to the Sea of Rome, The House of Austria, and great Bavarre, With Brabant, all our owne already are, But Britaine, Sweaden, and the warlike Dane, Wee seeke their Ruine, and they worke our Bane, There is a Parliament in England now, That all Romes Rights, and Rites do disallow, And sure the Scots, with them so fast are Knitt, That (to the Pope) they never will submit, Wee have done all we could, it plaine appeares To set them altogether by the eares, And wee have us'd all meanes how to prevent All the proceedings of the Parliament, We have sow'd false distrusts and iealousies, Mad Tumults, Libells, base reports and Lies; And over all the Land wee caus'd to flee, Ten thousand Pamphlets (all as true as Wee.) And yet we all, as if our wits were Dull'd, Are in our expectations) meerly Gull'd, For if we could that Parliament have broken, Wee had done somthing worthy to be spoken. But they are all (in Vnitie) so tide, That all our plots can never them devide. Which makes us now the out-cast scorne of men, The Common abicts of each Pasquill's Pen, And as our VVisdomes have been highly priz'd, Wee now are greatest Fooles, aod most despis'd; Wherefore (great Monarke of Eternall Night) Direct and teach us to regaine our Right, Inspire us with thy Rare Infernall skill, And wee obediently will doe thy will. Dev. I tell thee Son, that since the first Creation, I still have wrought the Churches desolation, The first man made, I taught to disobey The first borne, his iust Brother how to slay. Infernally I Sodome did inspire, Which drew upon them heavens consuming fire, To righteous Lot, I gave incestuous drinke, Noah unseemly in his Tent did winke, I tempted Corah, madly to Rebell, And hee and his were swallowed quick to Hell, I had a wedge on Achan to bestow, A Dallilah, a strong man to o'rethrow, In Ahabs Reigne, I had Knights of the Post, When Nabaoths Vineyard, and his life were lost, The Patriarks, and Prophets, every one, And my chiefe Enemie, Th'Almighties Sonne I persecuted to the death, and I, Have been the cause of all the Tiranny Inflicted on th'Apostles, and the Ten First persecuions on so many men, With Women, Children, as it plaine appeares In Histories, the first three hundred yeeres, I in the Marrian Time did Havock make In England, Thousands were consum'd at stake, The massacres in France, I form'd and wrought, And thousand Protestants to death I brought, Two Henries, Kings of France, both murdered, And William, Prince of Aurenge, pistol'd dead, Duke D'Alva, vex'd the Netherlanders too, And Tiranniz'd as bad as I could doe, The plot of eighty eight I did proiect, (A vengeance light on't, 'thad but bad effect) And I the Powder Treason first did mint, Although we had but scurvy fortune in't. These have I done, and mischiefes millions more, And yet I have not empted all my store. Ies. Great Emperour of Darknesse, briefly then, Seeke to confound the Scots and English men, They are our greatest and our hatefull'st foes, Of all our Enemies, none like to those. The Hollanders of Amsterdam, or Delfe, Their faith is much indifferent (like my selfe) As for Religion, so it bring in profit, Let it be what it will, they thinke not of it: Geneva is a little paltry Plot, That hath all Romish duty quite forgot; But Britaine is the Magazen of them, That will tread downe the Papall Diadem, Therefore against them all your forces call, For if you conquer them, you have won all. Dev. My pen posts (Libels) my learned Scribes Ile set a work, and I will fill with Bribes; The hands of Iustice, Gold shall cleare, or bleare His eyes, and stop her eares, she shall not heare, Suspitious Ielousies, Ile frame, and fling, Shall breed distaste 'twixt Subiects and the King, That though they all meane well, Ile make a puther, They scarcely shall beleeve, or trust each other: I in the Church will such division sow, Which shall goe neere the Church to overthrow: Ile scatter strange Hreticall opinions, In every corner of the Lands Dominions, That those that see the madnesse of their Braines, Shall thinke the Devill is in them, taking paines, Like Hidraes heads, I'le make complaints encrease That shall disturbe the King and Kingdomes peace; In every corner, I such strife will scatter, That it shall seeme a Poole of troubled water, Besides, my Irish Sons (the great O Donnell) With his stout Kernes, and noble stout Tirconnell: These with great troopes of Rebells, I will reare, That shall disturbe and worke much mischiefe there. A Proverb saies, He that will England winne, He boldly first (with Ireland must begin,) And there already, I have so begun, That I doubt not our will, will there be done. Thus (Fencer-like) my aime and stroke is wide, I strike at England, quite through Irelands side. Ies. Could you make England like to Germany, A Field of bloud, a Land of misery, A grizly Golgatha of Dead Mens Bones, An Empire wasted, full of sighes and groanes: Your plots and ours, there twenty yeares have lasted, In halfe that time all Brittaine may be wasted; We (of our holy Order) have instill'd, Such counsell into Cesars eares, which fill'd His Royall heart with wrath, his minde with error, All Christendome with horror, griefe and terror: Bavariaes Duke we (as we pleas'd) did mold, We drave the Palsgrave from Bohemias Hold, (For never Prince did our Enchantments hear, But he was straight wayes ours, through love or feare) We are their Confessors, we know their mind, And at our pleasure. can them turne and winde, They doe confesse themselves to us, and we Doe know their secrets, and their Masters be, Yet though (like Kings) we rule and Raigne, The King of Brittaine we shall never gaine, He tearmes us vassals to the Romish Whore, And scornes us, as his Father did before. Dev. Well, since we cannot win him, this wee'l doe, Wee'l trouble him, and all his people too, And we have reason for't, for he of late, A match with Aurange Son did consumate, And his faire Daughter, sure that marriage may Prove crosse to our proceedings many a way, For if Nassaw had not led Belgias powers, The Butter Boxes, had long since bin ours; Could'st thou have crost that Marriage, thou hadst done A worke most worthy to be call'd my son. Ies. The newes of it amongst us was so bad, At Doway, and at Antwerp all were mad, But could not hinder't, there's a power supernall, That countermands our pollices infernall; And since we cannot win what we intend, Let us continually our forces bend, That what we cannot gaine with care and toyle, We may disturb, vex, ruinate, and spoyle. Dev. Ile fill the Cinque Ports of the Isle of Man With mallice and with mischiefe all I can, I will mens fancies with such humours fit, They shall want time to think on grace, or wit, Ile kil their loves, and for it give them scornes, That all shall kicke the man whom Fortune spurnes, Fantasticke toyes within their pates shall gingle, And truth with falshood they shall brew and mingle, Ile make the World of such an od condition, Ile turn it to foole, feather, or Physitian, This can I can doe and take but little paine, 'Tis but to doe my old worke o're againe, So farewell Son, let's once againe begin To doe some mischiefe where we cannot win. Ies. I have a short complaint few yeares agon, A Latine Annagram I look'd upon; Against the Pope most knavishly 'tis writ, Ile read it, and you can interpret it. Supreamus Pontifex Romanus. ANNAGRAMMA. O Non Sum Supra Petram fixus. Dev. This gives your Holy Father a shrewd knock, It sayes he is not fixed on a Rock: Let him fix where he can, let's make an end, As long as hee'l serve me, I am his friend. FINIS. TAILORS TRAVELS, from LONDON, TO THE ISLE of WIGHT: With his Returne, and occasion of his Iourney. The verse has been extracted from prose text. [This Pamphlet is not stuft with Triviall Bables] This Pamphlet is not stuft with Triviall Bables, Or vaine prodigious undisgested fables: This is no Mercury (with scoffs and jeeres) To raise debate, and set us by the eares, As if poore England had not yet endur'd Sufficient plagues, but she must be assur'd, By New, New, Newes, of New frights, and new foes, And future mischiefes worse than present woes: I bring no tidings of such consequence, To breed Feares, Jealousies, or give offence, Nor am I fraught with wonders, woundes, and scarres, Or any thing relating to the Warres: It is so writ that no man can accuse Me of detraction, scandall, or abuse; My lines are all from feare and horror free, And here and there as true as true may be: Yea much more true, I may be bound to sweare Then many bookes have beene this twice foure yeare, Or any Mercury writ heretofore, Or old Currantoes, in the daies of Yore. Then stroke your beards, or wipe your mouthes (at least) And read, and heare what I have here exprest. [The next succeeding month unto September] The next succeeding month unto September, October was this yeare, (as I remember) Without the charge of Proxey or Atturney, My selfe in proper Person tooke this journey: Two Gentlewomen (by two Maides attended) Accompanied me till my travells ended. We tooke one Coach, two Coach-men, and foure horses, And merrily from London made our courses: We wheel'd the top of th'heavy hill, call'd Holborne, (Vp which hath been full many a sinfull soule borne:) And so along we jolted past Saint Gileses, Which place from Brainford, six (or neere) seven miles is. To Stanes that night at five a clock we coasted, Where (at the The signe of the Bush. Bush) we had bak'd, boyl'd, and roasted. Bright Sols illustrious Rayes, the day adorning, We past Bagshot and Bawwaw, Friday morning; That night we lodg'd at the White Hart at Alton, And had good meate, a table with a salt on: Next morne w'arose, with blushing cheek'd The dawning. Aurora; The wayes were faire but not so faire as Flora: For Flora was a beautifull Courtezan in Rome, who gat great treasure by the prostitution of her body, which Wealth she gave to the Common Treasury, for which they did esteeme her a Goddes, and the Goddes of Flowers, and built a Temple to her. Flora was a Goddesse, and a woman, And (like the high wayes) was to all men Common: Our Horses, with the Coach, which we went into, Did hurry us amaine through thick and thine to With fiery speede, the foaming bits they champt on, And brought us to the Dolphin at Southampton. There found I friendship more then I expected Or did deserve, so much to be respected: The Gentlewomen both their husbands met there; The Moone was mounted, and the Sun was set there; And after two houres time, or some such matter We turn'd our Coach t'a boat, and swam by water; My entertainement was good wine and welcome, The cups most kindly unto me pell mell come; Southamptons Governour, much love did show me, He was my old acquaintance, and did know me: He gave me's passe, to passe me to the Island And I tooke boate, and left him on the dry Land; It was as bright a moonshine night, I say As ever man saw in a Summers day; Thus with a fore winde, and faire Cintha's light, In foure houres time we came to the Isle of Wight: We past Cowes Castle, and into the Towne went, Where some short time we wandring up and downe went; Thus being favour'd by men, windes and weathers, At Cowes I landed, and lodg'd at the Feathers: The Isle of Wight contain'd a Wight of Waigh then, And on that Wight of Waight, I came to wait then. Long live he blest internall, and externall. And blest be England in his love paternall, To guide and guard him, grace and power supernall, Defend him from all trecherous traps infernall: In imitation of him let us learne all To live so heer that we may live eternall: And thou, whose mercy nere can be exhausted, In thy compassion thinke on England wasted: The sword of wrath that's drawne is justly thine, The Sinnes that made thee draw it forth are mine: Jonas the storme did to himselfe apply; Let each say so now, each man say tis I. And now my story briefely Ile compose, From harsh hard rugged rime, to smooth fac'd prose. [Then I with kicking set my heeles to horse] Then I with kicking set my heeles to horse, Advent'ring to ride through it force perforce: My guides misguiding made me much the bolder, The horse fell in, quite plung'd up to the shoulder. I forward fell, and backward fell the Maid, Man, Maide, and horse in curious pickle laid, And never Eare did heare, or Eye did see Such a pair-Royall faire Triplicity. The danger past, we each on other gaping; Not angry, or well pleas'd, we fell to scraping: Sometimes we fretted, and our lips did bite, And sometimes (at our selves) we laught out right. I scrapt my selfe, the Maide, the Hostler drest, The Horse lookt on, uncurried like a beast. Thus we to Newport came in gay attire, Embrodred over all with dirt and mire: And thus from Cowes we tumbled in the slowes, Man, Maide, and horse, moil'd like three beastly sowes: 'Twas my base guide that put me in this trim, For which abuse Ile have a bout with him: The Divell misleades us all, we plainely see, And that same stinking Hostler misled me. For which: First in a Knaves skinne I will wrap him hot, Which he shall alwaies weare until it rot: My prayer for him shall be this execration, Let him be nasty in his occupation: Oh let his provender be ever musty, His hay be most distastfull, foule, and dusty: His Pease, and Beanes, and Oates most odious fusty, And's curry combe (for want of use) be rusty: Thus musty, dusty, fusty, rusty, crusty, Shall plague the Knave that was to me untrusty. In Vrine, and Beasts Ordure let him toile: Soile be his trade, yet nere be Lord oth' soile. Let boot haling be most part of his living: Let Guests be sparing to him in their giving: Vnder his Rack let him in tortures lye, And (in his Manger) let him stinke and dye: And let the preaching Cobler at Blackwall Be 3 houres prating at his funerall: Let him be grav'd in his owne Element: Let litter, and horse dung be his monument. But leaving riff raff rime, Ile turne my stile, To some more serious businesse in the Isle. Thus having overpast this foule disaster, I went to see my suffring Soveraigne Master: Which sight to me was all my Earthly blisse, He gave me straight his Royall hand to kisse, Which grac'd me much in all the publique sights Of Commons, Gentles, and brave Lords and Knights. [And therefore Reader understand and note] And therefore Reader understand and note, Who ever sayes I lye, he lies in's throate. [Blest Englands joy (the King) will come e're long.] Blest Englands joy (the King) will come e're long. Praise God, make Bonefires, swing the Bells, ding dong. And let him never beare a Christians name, Whose trade and pleasure is in blood and flame Of his deare Countrey, and rip, rend, and teare His Mothers Womb, that such a brat did beare. FINIS. THE Essence, Quintessence, Insence, Innocence, Lye-sence, &amp; Magnifisence OF Nonsence upon Sence: OR, SENCEuponNONSENCE. In Laudem Authoris. Must Non-sence fill up every Page? Is it to save th'expence Of wit? or will not this dull Age Be at the Charge of sence? But (John) though Fortune play the Whore, Let not the Vulgar know it; Perhaps if you had not been poor, You had not been a Poet. Your Estate's held in Capite, It lies upon Pernassus; Complain not then of Poverty, You are as rich as Crassus. H. B. Nonsense upon Sense, &amp;c. Mo?t meekly low, on blew presumptuous wings, Relate the force of fiery water Springs, Tell how the Artick, and Antartick Pole Together met at Hockley in the Hole: How Etna, and Vessuvius, in cold bloud, Were both drown'd in the Adriatick floud. Speak truth (like a Diurnall) let thy Pen Camelion like, rouze Lions from their Den, Turne frantick Wolpacks into melting Rocks, And put Olympus in a Tinder box: Report how Russian Cats doe barke like dogs, And Scithian Mountains are turnd Irish Bogs, Feast Ariadne with Tartarian Tripes, Transforme great Canons to Tobacco-pipes: Make Venus like a Negro, white as jet, And puffe-paste of the Tomb of Mahomet. Then mounted on a Windmill presently To Dunstable in Derbyshire I'le flie: From thence Ile take the Chariot of the Sun, And swim to Scotland, and bring news what's done: From thence Ile soare to silver Cintha's lap, And with Endimion take a nine years nap: There Ile drinke healths with smug-face Mulciber, At all the twelve signes in the Hemisphere. Tush tell not me these things are past dispute, I'le from th'Hesperides bring golden fruit: Such as the Poets Palfrey Pegasus, Fetch'd from the fertile Molehill Caucasus, Tis not the Persian Gulph, or Epshams Well, Nor Westminsters sweet Plum-broth (made in Hell) Can change my resolution, I have vow'd, To speake with silence and to write aloud, That Bulls of Basan, and the Circean Swine, Shall all dance Trenchmore at these words of mine. Rowse up thou Ghost of Gusman, and apply Thy selfe to me and let's write Tempe dry: Be rul'd by me, we'le empty all Hellicon, In scribling 'gainst the Whore of Babylon. The Dunsmore Cows milke shall make Sillibubs, And our Religion shall be brought in Tubs. Make hast unto the faire call'd Bartholomew, And thence from the Heroick Mungrell Crew, Take the fine gugaw hobby horses all, Which we will man, and then a Counsell call And conquer Callice, Kent and Christendome, Knock down the Turck, and bravely ransack Rome; What can be done more? What more can be sed? Let's play at Blind-man-buffe for Ginger-bread: We'le have a dish of Dabs in Fish-street drest, And with the Lobsters Ladies we will feast. For as the Gowt is but a pleasing itch, The best Bear-garden Bull-dog was a Bitch. We have both eight and eighteen parts of speech, Whereby I learn Ash burns as well as Beech, Gargantua's scull is made a frying pan To fry or follow the Leviathan, That Gogmagog, Nick Wood, or Mariot, Nor Creatan, Miloe or Iscariot Were not such valiant stomack'd men as those That eat the Devils gowty petitoes. Hark, hark, how from the South fierce Boreas rores Give me a Sculler or a pair of Oares. Ile make the Orient, and the Occident, Both friends at Smithfield in the wild of Kent: For now Tom Holders Mare hath broke her Cruppe Dresse me a dish of Æ-dipthongs to supper. The Dean of Dunstable hath bought and sold Twelve lies new Printed, for two groats in gold. Tis almost past the memory of man, Since famous Arthur first in Court began: Yet though King Lud did raign in Troynovaunt, Will Summers was no kin to John of Gaunt. What news from Tripoly? ware horns there ho: The West-wind blows South-North at Ierico. Steer well and steady, boyes look, look to th'Helme, Fetch Goesberries that Grow upon the Elme: Like Cormorants lets live upon the Ayre, And of a Whirle-poole make a Marble Chair. Blind men may see, and deafe men all shall hear How dumb men talk, because Cow-hides are dear. Go to th'Utopian Kingdome and relate, That to their King these lines I dedicate: Bid him take note of me, and understand He hath not such a Poet in his Land. Down by the dale with milk and cream that flows, Upon a Hill (below the Valley) grows Hungarian Peacocks white as crimson Geese, There sate a Rat upon a Holland Cheese: No sooner did blind Bayard see the sight, Two beauteous ugly Witches took their flight To tell the King of China wondrous news, Howall Scotch Knaves were hang'd and English Iews. Th'Athenian Hidra, and the Bird Torpedo Were catcht in France in Mouse-traps near Toledo. A Scolopendra comming neare Pickthatch, Made drunke a Constable and stole the watch. Do what you can, Madge howlet is an Owle: And Beans with Buttermilke is rare wilde Fowle. The Coblers daughter, wee three both together, Wee'le match, he'l give a thousand pieces with her; Besides the smoak of Keinsam and Bell-Swagger, Who oft at Mims did use his dudgeon Dagger: Then shall the Perecranians of the East, South, North, and West, with every Bird and Beast; All knuckle deep in Paphlagonian Sands, Inhabite Transilvanian Netherlands: 'Tis the onely gallant way to gaine promotion, To squeese Oyle from the Cindars of Devotion, Transsate our Rownd head Turnips into Carrets, And turne the lowest Cellars to high Garrets: Let Neptune be a shepheard, and let Vulcan Make hast to Greeneland, and there drinke his full Kan. Of Molehils in the entrance of Dame Theatis, Titus Andronicus hath writ a Treatise, Wherein a man may learn before he looks To catch mince-pies with neither nets nor hooks: There policy with practise cut and dri'd Were carted both in triumph through Cheapside. If Monday hang himselfe no further seek. Henceforth Tuesday shall begin the week. No more of that I pray, I am afear'd Ther's not one haire upon Diana's beard. Great Agamemnon late combin'd with Hector, To preach at Amsterdam an Irish Lector, Which shall convert the Horse, the Asse, and Mule And all the Beasts in Hipperborean Thule If Sun-shine will with shaddowes but consent We'le make the winter of our discontent To force fierce Crook-back into better tune, And turne Decembers heat to frost in June. When this externall substance of my soule Did live at liberty, I caught wild fowle, I was a Caiftiffe in the Court of Spaine, And playd at shuttle-cock with Charlemaine: Then I did magnifie and mundifie, Then I the Fairy Queen did putrifie, And purifie againe, and dignifie, All such as did her greatnesse deifie, Females did edifie and fructifie, And Amplifie and coldly gratifie. The Lake of Lerna I did clarifie, My Verse the Æthiop Queen did beautifie, With rage my patience I would qualifie, I can both certifie and testifie How death did live, and life did mortifie: Feare alwayes did my courage fortifie: He's crafty that his wits can rectifie, To villifie, make glad and terrifie, And with course words old debts to satisfie, That man Ile ratifie and notifie To be one that himselfe will Justifie, And fie, fo, fum, concludes him with O fie: Thus from complexions I have Mineralls drawne, Brave Captaine Fumble layd his sword to pawn To ransome Jeffery Chaucers Cipresse Gowne. Thersitis with a Rush knockt Ajax downe Imperious Momus wrote th'Atlantick story Of wars betwixt Achilles and John Dory: 'Twas dedicated to the Isle of Lundy, An Embleame right of transit gloria mundi. Thus the great Amadis de Gal was able With Nonsence (like sence) to endure a Fable Thus Mirmidons, upon the plains of Sarum Did beat up Pompies quarters with alarum. Let not the distances of place molest us, Abidos is not forty miles from Sestus: As Hero lov'd Leander, I'le agree, Though he and she were mad, what's that to me? Tis like Cleopatra and Antonius Met, but saw not the Cardinall Baronius: The Capitol, and silken Rock Tarpeyus In a Seadan to Lichfield shall convey us; And like a wheel-barrow we'l cut and curry, And fetch good news from Shropshire and from Surry: There is no Eunuch of the Race of Brutus, That either can confute us, or cornute us. Old Solon was no jester, nor no jyber, And English Thames is better than Rome's Tyber: I took a Camel, and to Naples went I, Of pickled Sausedges I found great plenty: The Gudgeon catcher there o'retop'd the Nobles, And put the Vice Roy in a peck of troubles: Brave tag rag multitude of Omnium Gatherum, Shuffle 'um together, and the Devill father 'um: But now and then was squez'd a rich Delinquent, By which good means away the precious chink went: Renowned was the Raskall Massennello, In fifteen dayes he was raw, ripe, and mellow. Laugh, laugh, thou whining Foole Heraclitus, And weep thou grinning Asse Democritus: The grey Horse is the better Mare by halfe, The Bull at Bear-Garden, and Walthams Calfe Are reconcil'd, but not concluded fully Who pleaded best, Demosthenes or Tully: I am indifferent, fill the other Kan, Logick hath art to make an Ape a man. I weeping sing, to think upon the Quiblins Twixt Romane, and Imperiall Guelphs and Giblins. How Munsters John a Leide, and Knipperdoling Were barbarous Barbers in the art of poling. From Sence and Nonsence, I am wide, quoth Wallice, But not so far as Oxford is from Callice: Give me a Leash of merry blades, right Bilboes, True tatter'd Rogues in Breech, Shirts, Skirts, and Elboes, And each of them will make a fit Disciple. To ride up Holborn to the tree that's triple: A man may think his purse is quite turn'd Round-head, When all the crosses in it are confounded: 'Tis sayd that Poetry a thriving trade is, And gets a world of wealth from Lords and Ladies; The Devill they do, false shamefull Lown thou ly'st, And when thou canst no longer live, thou dy'st. Lend me Rhamnussnes Flanders blade, Ile lash The sober Centaure, turn great Oaks to Ash: A long Devils broath, be sure you bring a spoon, Our mornings shall begin at afternoon; And Minos, Eacus, nor Rhadamantus May rore and rant, but never shall out rant us. As we are Temporall, let's be Temporizers, We scorn to be surpriz'd, we'l be surprizers: Let's make grim Pluto stink, the welkin rumble, And Hollophernes bluster, blow, and grumble, Rending up mighty Thistles by the roots, Because an Ostler stole away his boots: Then with a multiplying Gally pot, Ile know the projects of the crasty Scot; And then he shall be forc'd to hide his head In Tenebris, in Poland, or in Swead: Fough, this Tobacco stinks; thou dirty Hag, Stand further near, Ile put thee in a bag. Search Asia, Affrick and America, To find the Goddesse Berecinthia, And know how Pirramus and this befell Together by the years late in Bridewell. Words are but wind in Terme time, but Vacations Are fit to publish silent Proclamations. There was a businesse never understood, The woman's suit in Law was just and good: She lost the day, this did her Cause disgrace, The Lawyer put some ill into her Case. Before Ile live this life, Ile take a knife, And drown my selfe, and then what needs a Wife? Strange things are done by Art and humane power, Quinborow Castle landed neare the Tower. Much like a Prodigy old time played Rex: A Kentish Castle came to Middlesex. May not a man cal'd Newgate dwell at Higate, And wed a Widdow at the Pie at Algate? Therefore let us like or dislike Presbytery, It will worke finely if it once besquitter ye. Bring me a Salamander from Surat in France, The Alps and the Pirenian hils shall dance. In Greenewich Parke there smiling Nioby Shall laugh and lye downe like an Oyster Pye. Fame is a lying slut, she told me tayles, That in October Christmas came from Wales: Believe it take the wings of Icarus, And walke to Hounsditch, and to Erebus, There tell them playnly how the case stands here. And bring us word how matters do goe there. Unto the Market Ile run presently, And there a peck of troubles I will buy, One told me they would multiply and grow: All England with them I will plant and sow. Which as they ripen dayly Ile take care That every living soule shall have a share: Ile serve myselfe first, and Ile have such store In time of need to serve a thousand more. But I forget my Theame. O foule offence! This nonsence hath a taste of too much sense: The Asse, Goos, Woodcock, Buzard, and the Gull, Beat out their brains, and put them in my scull; And tell the men of Gotham tis thought fit The Wisemen there should lend me all their wit: For Nonsence I will tax all Christendome, Great Emperours and Kings shall pay me some, And many a Major, or justice of the Peace Will give me tribute and the Tax encrease To such a height, that Cardinals from Rome, Cuckolds, and Costables shall pay me some: Strong Hull, with fatal Hell, and Hallifax, Shall naturally bring me tole and tax: The mighty stock of Nonsence I will win: Shalbe the universal Magazine, For Universities to worke upon The Rich Philosophers admired Stone: Then I make Poets rich, and Usurers poor; And thus resolv'd at this time write no more. Or thus you may English it, in the transcending prayse of the Authour and his Booke. Till Phœbus blustring blasts shall cease to blow, And Æolus shall hide his radiant Rayes Till Vulcans Forge be fram'd of Scithian Snow, And Neptune like a Shepheard spend his dayes; When Saturne shall sell Mouse traps and allow Mars to sing Madrigals, and round delayes: Then shall thy Book and thee be out of Date, And scorn the envy of consuming Fate. To your Worthinesse in all observance Devoted, John Defislie Cankie of Sallamanca in Andalusia. [Swift Pepasus lend me thy Hoofes and Wings] Swift Pepasus lend me thy Hoofes and Wings Tempe, and Aganipp, and such strange things As Poets do call Hellicon, and Muses (That with ingenious wit the braine infuses) In nimble strains make my invention wag, And tell the sad death of a Scottish Nag. A Nag of Nags, (as those that knew him say) Whose birth and breeding was in Galloway, Which Countrey (though it barren be and bare) His Mother was a well reputed Mare: He had all paces, and more swift then Wind, Could trot before and amble well behind; He had two sorts of gallops, false and true, That when he did but run, men thought he flew! Sure he was kin to winged Pegasus, And of the race of great Bucephalus; But Ile not rake up old Antiquity. To prove his Ancesters old Pedigree: Let it suffice, that such a Horse he was That could in measure bravely pace and passe, A Bay, a gallant Bay, most swift and quick, Not having one base scurvy jadish trick. There's many brave men, in their finest trim Wants what this Nag had, sound of Wind and Limb. He di'd untimely by a sad disaster, And death unluckily unhors'd his master. Though Horses of diseases have too many, Yet in his life time he had never any: He had no Chin-gall, Wind-gall, Navell-gall, Or Staggers, Spur-gall, Light-gall, Shacksgall, Nor Wormes, or anticore, or Salenders, Nor Scatches, Dropsie, or the Mallenders, No Palsey, Feaver vext him, or Pompardy, No frenzy troubled him, he was so hardy; No Glanders, Cough, the Yellows, or Pole evill, Or Spavens, Splinters, Fashions, or Colt-evill; Nor Ring-bones, Quitter-bones, no Curbs or Hawse, Were of this Nags death any griefe or Cause; No Cramp or Canker, Crestfall, or the Vives, Or bloudy Riffes that shorten Horses lives. He had no Crown-scab, nor was ever found To have the Hawkes, or Toothach, or Hide-bound, Or Bots, or Botch, or Paps his health did wound. No tongue-hurt Farley, rotten Frush, or Cloy'd, No Kybes, or broken wind his health annoy'd; No Bladders, Surbates, Wrench, or Tyrednesse, No strain, no Scottish fleas, or lowsinesse; No prick 'ith soale, Neck-creek, or shoulder splat, Or Strangle, he ne'r troubled was with that; He had no Pin and Web, loose-hoof'd, or gravel'd, Bloud shot, or founder'd whensoere he travel'd; Horse-hip'd he was not, or in's Groyn a Wen, Nor Rot i'th Lungs, nor shed his hair, what then Did kill him? some suppose it was the Pose; But we are all deceiv'd, 'twas none of those: No Megrim was his death, or Calenture, He with a Surfeit dy'd an Epicure. But change of Pasture, altring of the Ayre The health of Man or Horse may much impaire: For by old Par it plainly doth appear, (Who liv'd in Shropshire sevenscore thirteen year) Was by an Honorable Earles expence, With Care and Cost to London brought from thence, But change of Ayre and Dyet took short course, And layd him dead, like Master Fradshams horse. This Nag in Scotland kept a temperate dyet, (For Gallaway's a Country free from Riot) Nor can it be reported anywhere, That ever Horse did dye of Surfet there: With Provender they are not proud, prick'd up, With moderation there they bite and sup; Their fare is fruitfull Fearn, and wholesome Heath, Which frugall food preserves long wind or Breath, Or Mosse as soft as downe or good chop'd straw; (For Horses there think Hay Apocrypha) An English Horse-loafe's Antichristian, And all their Nags are Presbyterian: For had I Aristotiles wit, my pen Would prove strange Sects in Horses as in men: The Spanish Jennet, and the Flaunders Mare, Betwixt them many strange opinions are: The Sumpter Horse will prance a lofty Gate, Proud with the Burthen of ill gotten plate; The Naples Courser, and the German steed, The Barbary Horse that 'mongst the Moors doth breed, The Cart horse, French Cavalla, Irish Hobby, The Welsh Tit that loves Oates beyond Couse-bobby: A man may write and talke, and wast his wind, Yet never make these horses of one mind; And many sects there are that disagree, Who in Religion like to Horses be: And sure more Horses have to Churches gone Within these ten years, then was ever known: This Nag, neare Hampton Court, did catch his death And to his Master did his skin bequeath; His Brains, Wit, Reason, and his honesty, He gave to's Countrey as a Legacy: His Corps had near a hundred Graves and Tombs, In light foot Hounds, Kites, Crows, and Ravens Wombs: Thus at his Funerall solemnity, He was most swift, and did both run and flie. The Second Part to the same Sence. When as a Woodcock did a Phœnix hatch, Once in the Raigne of Iulian the Apostate, When Spiders Nets an Elephant did catch, The Alehouse had no fire to make a Toast at; Then in those merry lamentable dayes, Upon a Christmas Eve near Michaelmas, New Market heath did hoarsly sing the praise Of Apuleius, or the Golden Asse. The Adamantine fall of seven fold Nile, Had boyl'd Musk-Millions from the Mount Pernassus, Whereas the sing song wanton Crocodile Made Romane Cressus smile, and Lidian Crassus, When Charing Crosse the Sun of Summers Leg, Had Kitned in the eyelids of a Nowne, And Christmas Carrols played at Mumble peg, With the Buls pizzel of a Market Towne; Then shall a Pronowne and a Participle Fight doggedly for wagging of a straw, And then Tom Thum with Gogmagog shall tipple, And shew the Learnedst Lawyers what is Law. Then Ghastly flesh of shillings fry'd in steaks, And Oyntments drawn from warm ingratitude Did draw the teeth of two and forty weeks From out the heels of sqemish magnitude. But yet (O yet) a new laid Madrigall Had bak'd the haunches of a Spanish child, And matcht 'em to Sir Guy the Seneschall, Who liv'd Adulterously with Bosworth field, Whilest this was doing, all undone, and Done, As men undoe a Trowt to make a Loach, For as with spoons a Lord may eat the Sun, So layes a Bitch her Litter in a Coach. The Times have beene, (but Time is turn'd to pap) That men might speake like Sea-crabs with a Quill, And old Devotion wore a corner'd Cap Upon the Stomack of a Water-mill. But as a Bag pipe-flying in the Ayre, Doth water all the Earth with Scottish Jigs, So Times do change their turns at Sturbridge Faire; For all the World now rides on Ale and Wigs. O that my wings could bleat like butter'd pease, But bleating and my Lungs have caught the itch, Which are as musty as the Irish Seas, Which in their left side now have both the Stich. I grant indeed, that Rainbows layd to sleep, Snort like a Woodknife in a Ladies eyes, Which makes her bark to see a Pudding creep, For creeping puddings alwayes please the Wise. The forc of custome makes a man to pisse A cast of Merlins in King Dido's mouth: Hence comes the squint ey'd Proverb, which is this, All men are borne their backsides to the South. A Letter late came from the Stygian Lake That told me Cerberus himselfe had choak'd: He took a Milstone for a butter'd Cake, when first red Herrings were at Yarmouth smoak'd: The Orientall Chilblains of the West Flew like a Colliflower in Chequer broath, And then the Fairy Queen in Buckrum drest, Rod through the Ayre well mounted on a Moth. Min as he is a Cloakbag, is a fish, But as a humane Creature he's a Cock: Which boyld with pindust in Chafing dish, Eats like stew'd Mustard made in Vulcans smock. Once in an evening when the morning Sun Did hotly speak with cold Meridian splendor; There was a jolly Frier told a Nun That Feminine was Masculine Male Gender. Things have their times, as Oysters have their wool: Dogs have their dayes, as Distaffes have their Gall, So all men living ought to dwell at Hull, For Hallifax cannot containe them all. A statesman once corrupted is a Gun, That ferrets Screachowls from Bellona's Beard, To make a handsome Codpiece for the Sun To were upon the pommell of his Sword. Man unto Man, is Man; but Man to Man, Is Herrings flesh, made of a yard of Ale, With the ingredients of a Dipping pan, Whiles Pancradge Church begets an Issue Male. An Oxe was lately in a Mouse-trap taken; Read but the booke of Weekly Newes, and note How many stock-fishes were made fat Bacon, Broyl'd on the Top-mast of a Mussell Boat, New Heroglyphick three-fold twisted Lines Of things that were, and were not, how Augustus With Ovids Metamorphoses combines, To try us oftentimes, but never trust us. The faculties of every humane soule Are made of Turpentine and Venson bones: Ingendred in the night-cap of an Owle That gives a Glister to the Torrid-Zones: For as a Pistoll lisps when he doth court Three paire of guts, bound up in true loves knots, So Easter Terme is cu.to'd but in sport, While Hobby-horses cur'd are of the Bots. Then smoth thy brow with milk-white discontent, And raise thy spirits up beneath thy feet. For Shrovetide now hath swallow'd Iack-a-lent. Because few Marriners are in the Fleet. I know I am a man abhorr'd of Bells That ring in Concave of an Heteroclite; I know the Cuckolds thoughts of Bathe and Wels, Do sizzle like a Mil-stone in a Net. I saw, but what I view'd, I never saw A row of Teeth penfeatherd in a Trowt, Whilst Perkins Horse orethrew a Case in Law, And he himselfe got fee farme of the Gowt. How can a Mayor Rule, but with a Lask, That may squirt Steeples in the teeth of Fame? For if they do, their touch-stone and their Flask Will fill the Winde with Polecats of the name. The clock doth strike when time bewrayes his hose, And Oysters catch the cough with being kinde: As Puttocks weare their Buttocks in their nose, So Fables weare their Bables in their minde. I grant indeed, that whoso may and can, Can never may, sith may doth can abey; But he that can and will, may will as man, But man can will, yet his will cannot may. Deep Philosophy. Call True the Taylor hither presently, For he must make a mantle for the Moone: Bid Atlas from his shoulders shake the sky, And lend and send me his left handed spoone. For Pride's a Pitchfork that the waile doth fill Of Ursa Mayor (God of Apple-Cakes,) Sloath is the Cucking stoole of Holborne hill, Much like a Sope-boyler upon a Iakes. Oh that I were in love with Bobbin-lace Or great with child of Tullies purple Gowne; Then to mine Ankles I would screw my face, To make a Paire of Boots for black Renowne, Faine would I leave, but leave at me doth grin, As doth a Custard when his nails doth ake; Or like a blew Bore in a Pudding skin, So I must manners leave for manners sake. Then rest my Rimes, before my reason's done, For women are all Wag tayles when they run: Who sets his wits my Sence to undermine, is A cunning man at Nonsence, farewell, Finis. The third part of the fourth Edition to the five Senses, or Sence aforesaid. Ile say no more, but what I mean to speak, And speaking what I say shall silence break. Mumbudget, let no words be utter'd neither, Let's seperate our speeches close together. Reach my fierce flye-flap, Van Trump, stand aloofe, My Arms and Armour's close Committee Proofe; Give me a Butterbox with not on rag on, I'le pickle him like to a Dutch flap Draggon: An Ordinance of Parliament shall scatter ye, Our Ordinance is Ordnance, that can batter ye. Me vat a whee, is Cambria Brittish French, Dick shifts a Trencher, but Tom keeps the Trench. An Annagram is John King, and King John, Five quarters of one year is four to one: May not a Miser wille a poor mans want, And give him lodging, cloathing, and provant, And hang himselfe, and give the Devill his due, Perhaps the Newes is too good to be true. I care not where mine Hostess, and mine Host lie, T'have meat and drink for nothing, is not costly. I could have written mad verse, sad verse, glad verse, But you shall be contented now with bad verse; I neither weep or sing of sweet Rebellion, Or story old I list not now to tell ye on: The Royall mad Lancastrians, and Yorkists Scare harm'd so much as some cornuted Forkists, The most uncivill civill Goths and Vandals Did not on their owne Countrey bring such scandals. The Turks, the Iews, the Canibals and Tartars Ne're kept such wicked, rude, unruly quarters. Ierusalems, Eleazer, Iohn, and Simon Did ne're yield Poet baser stuff to rime on. Like bloudy Sylla, and consuming Marius, One mischiefe did into another carry us. Amongst all Trades (some thousands zealous Widgeons) Were hardly more in number then Religions. In Preachers Roomes were Preach'd, for which I woe am, The basest people Priests like Ieroboam. That one may say of London, what a Town is't? It harbours in it many a Corbraind Brownist: Tis scatter'd full of Sects, alas how apt is't To be a Familist, or Anabaptist! Whilst Knaves (of both sides) with Religions Mantle, Have rifled England by patch, piece, and Cantle; That I may say of thee O London, London, What hath thy Wealth, Wit, Sword, &amp; furious Gun done? And what hath many a mothers wicked son done? Whereby (against their wills) there's many undone. Thrice happy had it been for our tranquility, If th'Authours of this incivility Had been a little check'd by Gregory Brandon, With each of them a hempen twisted band on. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FIFTH COLLECTION FAIRE AND fowle weather: OR A SEA AND LAND Storme, betweene two Calmes, WITH An Apologie in defence of the painefull life,and needfull vse of Sailers. To the Iudicious vnderstanding gentleman, and my much approued and esteemed good freind, Maister Robert Branthwaite, Gentleman Iaylor of the Kings Maiesties Tower of London. Iohn Taylor Dedicates this his Poeticall Weatherworke, with his best wishes, for your hearts contentment. Kinde Sir, my loue to you's ingag'd so deepe, That were I Idle, I were much ingratefull: Or should my thankes, forgetfull, euer sleepe In me, 'twere base, vnmannerly and hatefull. Then though I cannot pay you halfe my score, Vouchsafe to take this trifle as a part, As time enables me you shall haue more, And therefore now accept my willing heart. I know, you well doe vnderstand and know The weake defects of my defectiue Muse, Yet doe I hope you will this fauour showe That loue may her vnwilling faults excuse. And so to your protection I commend This Pamphlet, as vnto my deerest freind. Yours in my best imploiments to be commaunded. Iohn Taylor. Briefly to you that will Read. Not vnto euery one can Reade, I write; But onely vnto those that can Reade right, And therefore if thou canst not Read it well, I pray thee lay it downe, and learne to spell. But if thou wilt be hewing, (like a drudge) Hewe on, and spare not, but forbeare to Iudge. Thine if thou beest mine, Iohn Taylor. To his friend and neighbour Maister John Taylor. Fierce Neptunes wrath, and Eol's angry spleene Full many a time I haue both felt and seene, In leaking ship, and which hath grieu'd me more, In a long night a darke Moone, and lee shore: But such a storme as thou describest heere, Amazeth mee with wonder and with feare, And wert thou not both Water-man and Poet Thou neuer couldest halfe so plainely show it, I much reioyce thou safe on shore art come, And bid thee very kindly welcome home. Thomas Smith. To his friend Iohn Tailor. I cannot tell, how other men may praise The pleasing Method, thy Minerua layes In whatsoe'r it workes on, but to me It offers much desir'd varietie, To passe dull howres withall: with that, affords Much vsefull matter, which with Phrase, and Words, And all the aptest ornament of writ Thy pen doth furnish: This last birth of wit Is witnesse, worth beleeuing. Like the Glasse Great Arts-men vse, in shewing things that passe In parts farre from vs. This presents a Flawe, Or Storme at Sea: for what I red, I sawe. I so may speake. Me thought I had in sight, A Clowd, as blacke as the darke Robe of Night: Saw that dissolue, and fall in such a showre, As (mixt with lightning, and that voice of power, Makes Towres and Castles totter) made an howre Full of confounding horrour. Then againe, Mine eyes sad obiect, was the troubled Maine: Sweld vp, and curl'd, with that impetuous breath, Makes Land-men quake, and Seamen oft see death. On this, me thought, I sawe a vessell tost, Higher then ken, and in a minute, lost Betweene the Mountaine-billowes: At whose rise I sawe pale lookes, and heard the heauie cryes, Of those sad men that man'd her: After all, I sawe this Storme into a Calmenesse fall, As plaine, and smooth as Christall. In thy Booke All this is seene, as on thy lynes we looke. If where such life is, there can want delight, Though oft I read, Ile neuer dare to write. Tho: B. FAIRE AND FOWLE WEATHER. Yov triple-treble, thrice three Nimphes Diuine, Inspire this weake capacitie of mine, Oh let me quaffe of your Pegasian bowle, That I may write of Weather Faire and Fowle. That to the life, my lynes may heere informe, Description of a Calme, and then a Storme: Giue me that power that my vnlearned Verse, The Readers apprehension so may peirce, That though the Weather be exceeding faire, They may suppose a fowle and troublous Ayre. And when they come to reade tempestous lines, Then though the winde sleepe, and Hiperion shines, Yet let them thinke Heauens Axletree doth cracke, And Atlas throwes his burden from his backe. I wish my Verse should such Impression strike, That what men Read off, they should thinke the like. For apprehension must be quicke and yare, Imagination must be heere, and there, For if a Tempest be but smoothly read, It shewes the Readers Iudgement dull and dead. Or else to seeme to make the Welkin split, In thundring out a Calme shewes want of wit. Gainst Heau'n bread Poesie 'tis the worst offence, To haue it hack'd, and read with sencelesse sence. Then first I will describe Faire weather, chearefull, To make Fowle weather after seeme more fearefull. Vpon an Euening when Apolloes beames Declinde vnto the occidentall streames, As of the day he tooke his kinde adiew, The Clowdes, vermillion, purple, red, and blewe, Put on the radient liueries of the Sunne, (As quickly lost, as they were lightly wonne.) To th'under world in hast he tooke his flight, And left th'Horizon all in darknesse dight: Yet as he stoopt he glaunc'd his glorious eye, And staind the Welkin with a Crimson dye, Which did betoken, (as old sawes doe say) An Euening red, foretels a chearefull day. Sweete Philomella, gainst a thorne did sing, Exclaiming gainst the lustfull Thracian King, Whilst Progne in the Chimneys top doth keepe And for her selfe-borne selfe-slaine sonne doth weepe, Madge-howlet whooting cuts the empty skyes, The light she flees, and in the night she flyes. Bright Cinthia rises from her watry bed, And shewes her pale fac'd siluer horned head: Belighted and attended from her porch With many an hundred thousand, thousand torch. She light doth runne, and as she runnes doth light, The vniuersall Arch of pitchie night. Husht silence, (mortall foe to women kinde, In snoring sleepe did liuing sences binde, That (but for Rowting, and for drawing breath) It seem'd that all-deuouring grisly death) Without respect of person, Sex, or Lawes, Had grasp'd the world in his insatiate pawes. At last the Cocke proclaim'd the daies approach, And Titan call'd for his Diurnall Coach. He kist Aurora, and she blushing red, Ashamed, hid her shame fac'd Maidenhead. Pale Luna is obscur'd, her race is runne, Her light's extinguisht by the flaming Sunne. The bucksome day, roab'd in a silken Calme, With Zephers downy breath, as sweete as balme Perfum'd the vausty verge of the whole world, When golden Sol his glistring beames had hurld, And guilded tops of proud Clowd-kissing hils, And all the world with radient brightnesse fils. Faire Flora had embrodered ore the field, Whose various colours, various sents did yeild. The gentle winde amongst the leaues did whiske, The Goats did skip, the pretty Lambes did friske. The brookes did warble, birds did sweetly sing, With ioy to entertaine the gladsome Spring. Like heards of Kids the Porposes gan leape, The Seales and Scollopendraes, on a heape Doe vault and caper in such actiue sort, That Neptune tooke delight to see the sport. The Mountaine Whale, in his wide yawning chaps, Made shoales of smaller fishes fragment scraps, To fill his endles, bowndleffe, greedie gut, (For multitudes of littles hardly glut Th'unbottom'd gorge of gaping thirst for more, That pines in plentie, starues in midst of store) Sterne Nereus slept, rap'd in a pleasant dumpe, Whilst Triton pip'd leuoltoes with his Trumpe. Old Occeanus nimbly skipt and praunc'd, And turne-coate Proteus with faire Thetis daunc'd. The scaly Dolphins mounted on the waues, And sportiue Sturgeons one another laues. The Seahorse did curuet, and kicke, and fling, And without rider, mounts and runnes the ring. Yea all the watry squadrons tooke delight, To see the Sea so still, the day so bright. Was neuer gentler Calme on Neptunes face, All Elements in friendly sort embrace, As if in loue they were combin'd together, To giue poore mortall creatures pleasant weather. Bvt what is't that continues permament, That bydes belowe the spacious firmament Not any thing at all. Our sweet with sowre Is mixt and paine our pleasures doo deuoure. The pleasant fowntaines toads and aspacks breeds, In fairest fields are most contagious weeds. A minuts Ioy, foreruns a month of trobles, And vnder calmest Sea a tempest bubles. We (in a merry humor) Ankers wayd, And in a trice our winged sails displaid, And with a fresh and friendly welcome gale, Into the Maine amaine we mainely saile. Our stedfast course, right North North East we keepe, We sound and sound the Sea ten fathome deepe. We had not saild aboue a league or twaine, But Eolus began to mount the Maine Of Neptunes Monarchy, and with a troope Of full mouth'd winds, that made great oakes to stoope. With Ceders, Pines, and tall well-rooted Elmes, And topsie turuie lofty towres ore'whelmes. Resplendent Phœbus hid his glorious light, And day inuellop'd in a Roabe of night Attir'd the world in a blacke mourning gowne, As all things had bin turned vpside downe. Ioues lightning flames, and dire amazing flashing, At whom the Sea-God hils of water dashing, Against the Heau'ns did seeme in rage t'aspire, T'extinguish Ioues Celestial dreadfull fire. The spungy Clowds gainst one another crusht, And bursting, violent floods of Raine out gusht. Orion glar'd like a tempestuous Comet, Whilst Skyes, and Seas, did fire and water vomet. The ratling Thunder through the Ayre did rumble, As if Heau'ns frame into the Sea would tumble: Whole gusts of Sea ascends and fronts the Raine, And stormes of rain in fury fals againe, As if the Clowd contending water stroue, Great Neptune from his Palace to remoue. Big blustring Eoll blew confounding breath, And thunders dreadfull larums, threatned death. Downe powres whole floods of Raine and driu'ling sleete, As if Heau'n, Eath, and Sea had ment to meete In desperate opposition, to expire The World, and vnto Chaos backe retire. The rowling ruthlesse Billowes rage and rore, And batter'd fiercely gainst the rocky shore: Who by the rugged Crags repulsed back, With repercussiue anger threats our wracke. Thus whilst the Wind and Seas contending gods, In rough robustious furie were at ods, Our beaten Barke, tost like a forcelesse feather Twixt windes and waues, now hither and now thither, The top-mast sometimes tilting at the Moone, And being vp so soone, doth fall as soone, With such precipitating low descent, As if to Hels blacke Kingdome downe she went. The vncontroled Hipperborean blasts Teares all to tatters, tacklings, sailes and masts. And boystrus gusts of Eurus breath did hizze, And mongst our shrowds and Cordage wildly whizze. Our Ship no Rudder, or no steerage feeles, But like a Drunkard to and fro she reeles, Vnmanag'd, guidlesse, vp and downe she wallowed, And of the foaming waues lookes to be swallowed. Midst darknes, lightning, thunder, sleete, and raine, Remorceles winds, and mercie-wanting Maine, Amazement, horror, dread, from each mans face, Had chac'd away lifes blood, and in the place Was blacke dispaire, with haire heau'd vp vpright, With Ashy visage, and with sad affright, As if grim death with his all-murdring Dart, Had ayming bin at each mans bloodles heart. . . . . es the Bote-swaine, lower, the top-saile lower, Then up aloft runnes scrambling three or fower, But yet for all their hurly burly hast, Ere they got vp, downe tumbles Saile and Mast. Veare the maine sheate there, then the Maister cride, Let rise the foretacke on the larboord side. Take in the foresaile, yare good fellowes, yare, Aluffe healme there, ware no more beware. Sacere South-South-East there I say ware no more, Wee are in danger of the Leeward shore. Cleere your maine brace, let goe the hollin there, Porte porte the healme hard, Romer, come no neere. Then with a whiffe the winde amaine doth puffe, And then our Maister cride aluffe, aluffe, Clap hard the helme a Lee, yea, yea, done, done, Downe, downe alowe into the hold quicke, runne. The maine bend crackes, the plankes and timbers breake, Pump bullies, Carpenters quicke, stop the leake. Well pumpt my hearts of gold, who saies amends, The carefull Maister thus his throat he rends, Contending gainst the winde and weathers force, Till he with gaping and with toyle growes hoarce. But since the Thund'rers high imperious bride, Against Æneas had her anger tride, (Excepting this) a Storme so full of rage, Was neuer seene or heard in any age. Bvt when our losse of liues we most expected, Then pow'rfull pow'r of pow'rs vs all protected, The windes grew gentle that had blowne so stiffe, Sterne Eurus hyed him Eastward with a whiffe, And rugged Boreas, Northward trudg'd a pace, Hamidious Auster, to the South did trace. Sweete breathing Zephirus cride Westward hoe, Thus homeward all the furious windes did goe, And as they scud they swept th'uneven Maine From gusts, and flawes, and leaues it smooth and plaine. Like as the grasse in field, some short, some long, Some greene, some dead, with witherd flowers among, Vnequally in height some high some lowe, Vntil, the Mower equall all doth mowe, Where long and short cut downe together lies, And as it liues so it together dyes. Wherewith the sithe (all sharpe and barbing keene) The lab'rer shaues all euen, plaine and cleene. So are the billowes, blew, and greene, and white, By the winds home retreat all shauen quite. That Neptunes angry browe, look'd milde and euen, For Stormes and flawes before the windes were driuen. Or as a measure fild with Oates or Rye Vnstrooke and heap'd doth lye confusedly, Till at one stroake the Meater strikes it plaine, And makes the measure equall with the graine: So at one blow, the blowing of each winde, Stooke Stormes before them, and left Calmes behinde, That as bright Tytan in his Course did passe, He made the Sea his amomours looking glasse. And as himselfe had of himselfe a sight, His shadow seem'd t'eclips his substance quite, That he amazed ran, and ran amaz'd. And gaz'd and wink'd, and wink'd againe and gaz'd, That as Narsissus dyed by his owne error So Titan was intangled in this mirror. Vntill at last a curled woolsacke clowd His glorious substance from his shade did shrowde Great Neptune to his Court descended deepe, And layd his head in Thetis lap to sleepe. We presently let no aduantage slip, But nimbly we rerig'd our vnrig'd shippe, Our Courses, Bonnets, Drablers, Masts, and all With speede we merily to mending fall, And by Heau'ns fauour, and our willing paine, Into the wished hau'n we gaine a chaine. Wheare at an Anker we in safetie ride, Secur'd from stormes and tempests, winde, and tide. An Apologie for Sea-men, or the Description of a Marriners paines and aduentures. Vp sluggard Muse from Leathe's lazy Lake, And in plaine tearmes, a true Description make, Of toyles, of dangers, and excessiue paines, That Sea-men suffer for the Land mens gaines. The one doth hue a Shore, in wealth and ease, The other furrowes through th'vncertaine Seas. The one in pleasure liues, and lyes at home, The other cuts the raging salt-Sea fome. The one aduentures onely but his goods, The other hazards all, both goods and bloods. Mongst Pirates, tempests, rocks, fogs, gulfes and shelues, The Sea-men ventures all, and thats themselues. The Land-man (dangerlesse) doth eate and sleepe, The Sea-man stems and plowes the Ocean deepe. The one fares hard, and harder he doth lye, The other lyes and faires, soft, sweet, and dry. The one with dauntlesse vnrebated courage, Through greatest perils valliently doth forrage, And brings home Iewels, Siluer, Gold, and Pearles, T adorne both Court and Citie Dames, and Girles. They set whole Kingdomes both at wars or peace, They make wealth flowe, and plenty to encrease. The Countries farre remote, they doe vnite, They make vs sharers in the worlds delight: And what they get with paine, they spend in pleasure, They are no Mizers, hoorders vp of treasure. The oldest man aliue, did neuer see A Sailer and a Niggards minde agree. No, if their paines at Sea were ten times more, Tis all forgotten when they come ashore. And this much I dare publish with my pen, They are the best of Seruiceable men, The wals of Kingdomes, Castles of defence, Against Inuasion of each forreigne Prince. A torch lights not it selfe, yet wastes and burnes, So they their liues spend, seruing others turnes. The Marchant sits at home, and casts vp sums, And reckons gaines and losse, what goes, what comes: To what his whole aduentures may amount, He Ciphers, numbers, and he casts Account. And euery angy boystrous gust he heares Disturbs his sleepe, and fils his heart with feares, His goods at Sea awakes and startles him, For with them, his estate doth sinke or swim. But yet for all this heart tormenting strife, He's in no daunger of the losse of life By cut throate Sea-theeues, or a world of woes, Which many a Sailers life and state or' throwes. The Mariner abides the desperate shocks Of winde and weather, Pirates, sands and rocks: And what they get, they freely spend away, A whole months wages, in a night, or day. Their labours on the Sea they leaue a shore, And when all's spent, then to't againe for more: And pitty tis there should be such neglect Of such, whose seruice merits such respect. Whole spawnes of Land-sharks, and of guilded Guls, Of painted Mammets, and ilfauoured truls, Will hold their noses and cry fogh and fye, When seruiceable Marriners passe by: And then (their stomacks somewhat more to ease) What stinking tarlubbers (quoth they) are these. Then Mistris Fumpe troubled with the stitch, She's poysned with the smell of tarre and pitch. Some Frankinsence, or Iuniper, oh quick, Make haste I say, the Gentlewoman's sicke. And Mounsier Puffepast with the sattin slop, That sits in a Tobacco-sellers shop, And makes a stinke worse then a brace of Beares: When with a whiffe his witlesse worship sweares, How Sailers are Rude fellowes, and doe smell, Of pitch and tarre worse then the smoke of hell. But were the case now, as I erst haue knowne, That vse of men should haue their seruice showne, One Marriner would then doe much more good, Then twentie of these Sattin Milksop brood. Of all men then the Nauigator can, For King and Countries cause, best play the man: And howsoere they smell of tarre and pitch, Their painefull toyles doe make great Kingdomes rich. If we by foraine Warre should be annoyed, Then chiefly Marriners must be imployed, They on the Sea must bide the fiercest brunt, Grim death and danger they must first affront. One fight at Sea, with Ships couragious mand, Is more then three great battels on the Land. There men must stand to't, theres no way to fly, There must they Conqu'rers liue or Conquerd die. And if they dye not by some launching wound They are in hazard to be sunke and drownd. The murdring bullets, and the brinish waues, Are many a valliant Sea-mans death and graues. And tis a lamentable case to thinke, How these mens seruiceable number shrinke, Decreasing and consuming euery day, Where one doth breede, at least fowre doe decay, Some the Sea swallowes, but that which most grieues, Some turne Sea-monsters, Pirates, roauing theeues: Imploying their best skill in Nauigation, Gainst their owne Prince, and kin, and natiue Nation, By which meanes many a Marchant is vndone, And Pirates nere the better for whats won. For if (like Mosse his Mare) they be catcht napping, They bid the world their last farewell at Wapping. Which fatall Hauen, hath as many slaine, As could disturbe and shake the power of Spaine: And want of meanes, but (chiefly want of grace) Hath made so many perish in that place. But to conclude my Ryme, with heart and speach, I doe my God (for Iesus sake) beseech, That he for Sailors will vouchsafe to please, To graunt them good imployment on the Seas. So honest salt-Sea-watermen adiewe, I haue bin, am, and will be still for you. Whilst I liue, John Taylor. FINIS. MERCVRIVS AQVATICVS; OR, THE VVATER-POETS ANSWER TO ALL THAT hath or shall be Writ by MERCVRIVS BRITANICUS. Ex omni ligno non fit Mercurius. An Elegie on Master Pym. No immature or sullen Fate Did his immortall soul translate, He passed gravely hence even Kept the old pace, from earth to heaven; He had a soule did alwaies stand Open for businesse, like his hand, He took in so much, I could call Him more then individuall, And so much businesse waited by, Would scarcely giue him leaue to dye; He knew the bounds, and every thing Betwixt the people and the King; He could the just Proportions draw Betwixt Prerogative and Law; He liv'd a Patriot here so late, He knew each syllable of State That had our Charters all been gone, In him we had them every one; He durst be good, and at that time When innocence was halfe a crime; He had seen death before he went, Once had it as a token sent: He surfeted on State affaires, Di'd on a Plurisie of cares, Nor doth he now his mourners lacke, We have few soules but go in blacke, And for his sake have now put on A solemne Meditation. Teares are too narrow drops for him, And private sighes, too strait for Pym; None can compleatly Pym lament, But something like a Parliament, The publike sorrow of a State, Is but a griefe commensurate, We must enacted passions have, And Lawes for weeping at his grave. AN HONEST ANSWER TO THE LATE PUBLISHED APOLOGIE FOR PRIVATE PREACHING. THE SONG. To the Tune of, Turn again Whittington. Down fall those Beetle-brains, who have expounded False Doctrine in their Tubs, and truth confounded, The glorious Peace we had by them lies wounded, No men in thoughts so bad ever abounded: That I could wish they were all hang'd or drownded, We might say ther's an end of a Right Round-head. FINIS. THE NOBLE CAVALIER CARACTERISED, AND A REBELLIOUS CAVILLER CAVTERISED. The verse has been extracted from prose text. [But as poor silly Sheep run all together] But as poor silly Sheep run all together, And in confusion scud they know not whether, So those mad People, pray, disburse, and fight, Not knowing truths from lyes, or wrong from right: The Multitude like Dogges with open jawes, One bawles cause t'other barkes, yet knowes no cause: Aske Rebells what's the reason they rebell, And aske Dogges why they barke, they cannot tell.</field>
