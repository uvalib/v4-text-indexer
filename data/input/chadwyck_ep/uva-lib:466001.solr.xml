COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF February 1898. LOOK SEAWARD, SENTINEL! I Look seaward, Sentinel, and tell the land What you behold. SentinelI see the deep-ploughed furrows of the main Bristling with harvest; funnel, and keel, and shroud, Heaving and hurrying hither through gale and cloud, Winged by their burdens; argosies of grain, Flocks of strange breed and herds of southern strain, Fantastic stuffs and fruits of tropic bloom, Antarctic fleece and equatorial spice, Cargoes of cotton, and flax, and silk, and rice, Food for the hearth and staples for the loom: Huge vats of sugar, casks of wine and oil, Summoned from every sea to one sole shore By Empire's sceptre; the converging store Of Trade's pacific universal spoil. And heaving and hurrying hitherward to bring Tribute from every zone, they lift their voices, And, as a strong man revels and rejoices, They loudly and lustily chant, and this the song they sing. Chorus of Home-coming ShipsFrom the uttermost bound Of the wind and the foam, From creek and from sound, We are hastening home. We are laden with treasure From ransacked seas, To charm your leisure, To grace your ease. We have trodden the billows, And tracked the ford, To soften your pillows, To heap your board. The hills have been shattered, The forests scattered, Our white sails tattered, To swell your hoard. Is it blossom, or fruit, or Seed, you crave? The land is your suitor, The sea your slave. We have raced with the swallows, And threaded the floes Where the walrus wallows Mid melting snows; Sought regions torrid, And realms of sleet, To gem your forehead, To swathe your feet. And behold, now we tender, With pennons unfurled, For your comfort and splendour, The wealth of the world. II Look landward, Sentinel, and tell the sea What you behold. SentinelI see a land of liberty and peace, Ancient in glory and strength, but young in mien, Like immemorial forest Spring makes green, And whose boughs broaden as the years increase: Where ruminating hide and grazing fleece Dapple lush meadows diapered with flowers, Lambs bleat, birds carol, rosy children roam, The glad hind whistles as he wendeth home, And red roofs nestle under gray church-towers: Whose sons have in their fearless eyes the light Of centuries of fame and battles won And Empire ranging roundward with the sun; Whose fair frank daughters gleam upon the sight Fresh as the dawn and florid as the Spring; And, as from lowly porch and lordly dwelling They sally forth and meet, with voices swelling Harmoniously they chant, and this the song they sing. Chorus of IslandersBlest be the cliffs and the crags that girdle Our island home, And blest, thrice blest, the tempests that scourge and curdle The sea into foam. For the nations over the wave eat, sleep, and labour, In doubt and dread; The spear is the child at their threshold, the naked sabre The bride by their bed. But we behind bulwarks of brine and rampart of breakers, Year after year, Drop the seed in the drill and the furrow, and harvest our acres, And feel no fear. While they wattle their flocks, and remember the past, and shudder, And finger the sword, Our lambs go safe to the ewes, our calves to the udder, Our fruits to the board. Welcome the sleet that blinds and the blasts that buffet, And welcome the roar Of the storms that swoop on the sea and rend and rough it Around our shore. For in safety the yearling fattens, the heifer browses, The herds increase; In safety we fondle our babes, in safety our spouses, In safety, freedom, and peace. III Look again seaward, but beyond the sea, And say what you behold. SentinelI see weeping and wailing, and the bridegroom ruthlessly torn From the clinging arms of the bride, and I see and I hear Clanking of steel and clarions clamouring clear, And suckling mothers, wedded but forlorn, Cradling their babes amid the half-cut corn; Whose fathers, as the homely days grew ripe When fruits are plucked and mellow harvest stored, Felt the soft curving sickle from their gripe Timelessly wrenched, and in its place a sword. And I see the nations, like to restless waves, Surging against each other, withal afraid To close and clash, lest blade prove strong as blade, And even the victor win but worthless graves. And, wearying of the days and nights that bring No respite nor reward, they moan and murmur Under their breath, until with accents firmer They sadly and surlily chant, and this the song they sing. Chorus of Armed Nations How long shall we, we only, bear the burden And sweat beneath the strain Of iron Peace, while others gain the guerdon, And prosper on our pain? Lo! in their fancied fortress girt with waters That neither fall nor fail, They hear of rapine and they read of slaughters, As of some touching tale. No more they care to subjugate the billow, Or dominate the blast; Supine they lie on the luxurious pillow Of their resplendent Past. Lulled into arrogant languor by the glories Of their adventurous sires, They tell each other old heroic stories By comfortable fires. Why should they pile up wealth who do not labour? Why, sowing not, should reap? Let us steal out, and with unslumbering sabre Assassinate their sleep. IV Look again landward, Sentinel, and say What there you now behold. Sentinel I see the sports deserted on the green, And song and revel hushed within the hall; And I hear strong voices to strong voices call To muster round the shore in martial sheen. And north of Trent and south of Thames are seen Furnace and forge and factory vomiting fire, While swarthy faces, labouring through the night, On giant anvils giant hammers smite, From molten metal moulding hoop and tire. In port and arsenal rhythmic thunders ring, And through their gateways laden tumbrils rattle; And England's sinewy striplings, trim for battle, In unison cheer and chant, and this the song they sing. Chorus of Islanders Sweet are the ways of peace, and sweet The gales that fan the foam That sports with silvery-twinkling feet Around our island home. But, should the winds of battle shrill, And the billows crisp their mane, Down to the shore, from vale, from hill, From hamlet, town, and plain! The ocean our forefathers trod In many a forest keel, Shall feel our feet once more, but shod With ligaments of steel. Ours is the Sea, to rule, to keep, Our realm, and, if ye would Challenge dominion of the deep, Then make that challenge good. But ware ye lest your vauntings proud Be coffined in the surge, Our breakers be for you a shroud, Our battle-song your dirge. Peaceful within our peaceful home We ply the loom and share, Peaceful above the peaceful foam Our pennons float and fare; Bearing, for other peaceful lands, Through sunshine, storm, and snow, The harvest of industrious hands Peacefully to and fro. But, so ye will it, then our sails The blasts of war shall swell, And hold and hulk, now choked with bales, Be crammed with shot and shell. The waves impregnably shall bear Our bulwarks on their breast, And eyes of steel unsleeping glare Across each billowy crest; Along the trenches of the deep Unflinching faces shine, And Britain's stalwart sailors keep The bastions of the brine. Ocean itself, from strand to strand, Our citadel shall be, And, though the world together band, Not all the legions of the land Shall ever wrest from England's hand The Sceptre of the Sea. ALFRED'S SONG (From “England's Darling”) In the Beginning when, out of darkness, The Earth, the Heaven, The stars, the seasons, The mighty mainland, And whale-ploughed water, By God the Maker Were formed and fashioned, Then God made England. He made it shapely, With land-locked inlets, And gray-green nesses; With rivers roaming From fair-leafed forests Through windless valleys, Past plain and pasture, To sloping shingle: Thus God made England. Then like to the long-backed bounding billows, That foam and follow In rolling ridges, Before and after, To bluff and headland, Hither there tided The loose-limbed Briton, The lording Roman, And strong on his oars the sea-borne Saxon, And now the Norsemen Who hard with Alfred Wrestle for England. But onward and forward, In far days fairer, I see this England Made one and mighty: Mighty and master Of all within it. Mighty and master Of men high-seated, Of free-necked labour, Lowland and upland, And corn and cattle, And ploughland peaceful, Of happy homesteads That warmly nestle In holt and hollow. This is the England, In fair days forward, I see and sing of. Then, mighty and master of all within her, Of Celt and Briton, Angle and Frisian, Saxon and Norseman, Shall England plough, like the whale and walrus, The roaring ridges Of foam-necked water, With long-oared warships And keels high-beakëd; And never a foeman, Eastward or westward, Shall dare to raven Her salt-sea inlets, Her grim gray nesses, But, swift at the sight of her rearing cradles, Shall scud and scatter, Like wild geese fleeing 'Twixt wave and welkin, Away from the dread of the shrilling weapons Of foam-fenced England! SONNET (From “In Veronica's Garden”)Here, where the vine and fig bask hand in hand, And the hot lizard lies along the wall, Blinded I shrink where cypress shadows fall, And gaze upon the far-off mountains bland: Then down the dusty track Lorenzo planned Watch the slow oxen oscillating crawl Sleek in the sultry glare, and feel withal Half alien still in a familiar land. But when from out the stone-pine slopes that rise In the clear ether, black against the blue, The cuckoo suddenly calls, I close mine eyes In visionary rapture, think of you, Hear the home-music of your Kentish skies, And dream that I am drenched with English dew. WHY ENGLAND IS CONSERVATIVE I Because of our dear Mother, the fair Past, On whom twin Hope and Memory safely lean, And from whose fostering wisdom none shall wean Their love and faith, while love and faith shall last: Mother of happy homes and Empire vast, Of hamlets meek, and many a proud demesne, Blue spires of cottage smoke 'mong woodlands green, And comely altars where no stone is cast. And shall we barter these for gaping Throne, Dismantled towers, mean plots without a tree, A herd of hinds too equal to be free, Greedy of other's, jealous of their own, And, where sweet Order now breathes cadenced tone, Envy, and hate, and all uncharity? II Banish the fear! 'Twere infamy to yield To folly what to force had been denied, Or in the Senate quail before the tide We should have stemmed and routed in the field. What though no more we brandish sword and shield, Reason's keen blade is ready at our side, And manly brains, in wisdom panoplied, Can foil the shafts that treacherous sophists wield. The spirit of our fathers is not quelled. With weapons valid even as those they bore, Domain, Throne, Altar, still may be upheld, So we disdain, as they disdained of yore, The foreign froth that foams against our shore, Only by its white cliffs to be repelled! III Therefore, chime sweet and safely, village bells, And, rustic chancels, woo to reverent prayer, And, wise and simple, to the porch repair Round which Death, slumbering, dreamlike heaves and swells. Let hound and horn in wintry woods and dells Make jocund music though the boughs be bare, And whistling yokel guide his gleaming share Hard by the homes where gentle lordship dwells. Therefore sit high enthroned on every hill, Authority! and loved in every vale; Nor, old Tradition, falter in the tale Of lowly valour led by lofty will: And, though the throats of envy rage and rail, Be fair proud England proud fair England still! ON RETURNING TO ENGLAND There! once again I stand on home, Though round me still there swirls the foam, Leaping athwart the vessel's track To bid a wanderer welcome back, And though as yet through softening haze White cliffs but vaguely greet my gaze. For, England! yours the waves, the spray, And, be one's foothold what it may, Wherever billow wafts or wends, Your soil is trodden, your shore extends. How stern! how sweet! Though fresh from lands Where soft seas heave on slumbering strands, And zephyrs moistened by the south Seem kisses from an infant's mouth, My northern blood exults to face The rapture of this rough embrace, Glowing in every vein to feel The cordial caress of steel From spear-blue air and sword-blue sea, The armour of your liberty. Braced by the manly air, I reach My soul out to the approaching beach, And own, the instant I arrive, The dignity of being alive! And now with forward-faring feet Eager I leap to land, and greet The hearty grasp, the honest gaze, The voice that means the thing it says, The gait of men by birthright free, Unceremonial courtesy. None frown, none cringe, but, fearless-eyed, Are kindly all; since, side by side, Authority and Freedom reign In twin equality, and drain Their sanction from the self-same breast, And Law is wise Will manifest. Yes, this is England, frank and fair: I tread its turf, I breathe its air, And catch from every stalwart lung The music of my mother tongue. And who are these that cluster round With hastening feet and silvery sound, And eyes as liquid as the dawn, When laughs the dew on Kentish lawn? These England's daughters, frank yet arch, Supple as April, strong as March: Like pink-white windflowers in the grove, That came while east and west wind strove For mastery, and Spring seemed late, Hardy alike and delicate. How well their faces fit the scene, The copses gray, the hedgerows green, The white-veiled blackthorn, gorse afire, The cottage yew, the village spire; The pastures flecked with frisking lambs Around their gravely grazing dams; The children loitering home from school, Their hands and pinafores all full Of cuckoo-pint and bluebell spike, Gathered in dingle, dell, and dyke; The comely homes one just can see Through flowering belts of bush and tree, That all combine, all, all conspire, To more than satisfy desire, To make one love this lovely earth, And bless Heaven for one's British birth. Bewitching climes! where late I sought In change of scene a change of thought, Refreshment from familiar ground, And, what I sought for, more than found, Where old enchantment haunteth still Ligurian coast and Tuscan hill, Climes I have ventured oft and long To celebrate in faltering song, Where fearless almond, faery larch, Smiling, disarm the frown of March, Snow hath no terrors, frost no sting, And playful Winter mimics Spring, Deem me not thankless, nor deny Fresh welcome from your shore and sky, Repose from thought so oft implored, And ne'er refused, if, now restored By you to health, by you to home, Glad I return, late glad to roam. For dear to me though wayside shrine By silent gorge or murmuring brine; Dear though the barefoot peasant folk Who lop the vine and steer the yoke Of soft-eyed, sleek-skinned, creamy beeves, Up narrow ways to broad slant eaves; The stony mule-tracks twisting slow Up slopes where cherry-blossoms blow 'Mid olive gray and ilex brown, On to some sun-bronzed mountain town; The hush and cool of marble domes, Where, wed to reverie, one roams Through transept, chancel, cloister, cell, Where still with far-off faces dwell Sages and saints devoutly limned By hands long dust and eyes long dimmed; Dear though all these, and ne'er forgot, No southern shore, no sunniest spot, Not Roccabruna's hamlet crest, Not Eza's brow, not Taggia's breast, Not Bellosguardo's sunset hour, Not Dante's seat nor Giotto's Tower, Nor even Spiaggiascura's foam, Moisten and melt my heart like home. For here the cuckoo seems more glad, The nightingale more sweetly sad, Primroses more akin in gaze To childlike wonder, childlike ways; And all things that one sees and hears, Since rooted in the bygone years, And blending with their warm caress A touch of homely tenderness, Bid the quick instinct in one's blood Pay tribute unto motherhood. How should strange lands, it boots not where, Divorce one from one's native air, Or in a loyal breast dethrone Unreasoning reverence for one's own? Yet love and reason surely blend To stir this passion and commend? And who will blame if, though one seeks In gentler tides, and sterner peaks That tower above a wider plain, Contrast to northern hill and main, I cherish still and hold apart The fondest feeling in my heart For where, beneath one's parent sky, Our dear ones live, our dead ones lie? And you, dear friend, who linger still Beside the iris-crested rill That silvers through your olives gray From convent-capped Fiesole, Think not that I forget, forswear, The scenes we lately vowed so fair. To these your wandering footsteps bring The freshness of an English Spring; And even Florence sunnier glows, When Phyllis prattles and Ivor crows. And, though among them still you stray, Sweet-lengthening-out a Tuscan May, You too will here return before Our Northern roses blow once more, To prove to all of kindred birth, For winsome grace and sterling worth, Nothing can match, where'er we roam, An English wife in English home. IS LIFE WORTH LIVING? I Is life worth living? Yes, so long As Spring revives the year, And hails us with the cuckoo's song, To show that she is here; So long as May of April takes, In smiles and tears, farewell, And windflowers dapple all the brakes, And primroses the dell; While children in the woodlands yet Adorn their little laps With ladysmock and violet, And daisy-chain their caps; While over orchard daffodils Cloud-shadows float and fleet, And ousel pipes and laverock trills, And young lambs buck and bleat; So long as that which bursts the bud And swells and tunes the rill, Makes springtime in the maiden's blood, Life is worth living still. II Life not worth living! Come with me, Now that, through vanishing veil, Shimmers the dew on lawn and lea, And milk foams in the pail; Now that June's sweltering sunlight bathes With sweat the striplings lithe, As fall the long straight scented swathes Over the crescent scythe; Now that the throstle never stops His self-sufficing strain, And woodbine-trails festoon the copse, And eglantine the lane; Now rustic labour seems as sweet As leisure, and blithe herds Wend homeward with unweary feet, Carolling like the birds; Now all, except the lover's vow, And nightingale, is still; Here, in the twilight hour, allow, Life is worth living still. III When Summer, lingering half-forlorn, On Autumn loves to lean, And fields of slowly yellowing corn Are girt by woods still green; When hazel-nuts wax brown and plump, And apples rosy-red, And the owlet hoots from hollow stump, And the dormouse makes its bed; When crammed are all the granary floors, And the Hunter's moon is bright, And life again is sweet indoors, And logs again alight; Aye, even when the houseless wind Waileth through cleft and chink, And in the twilight maids grow kind, And jugs are filled and clink; When children clasp their hands and pray “Be done Thy heavenly will!” Who doth not lift his voice, and say, “Life is worth living still”? IV Is life worth living? Yes, so long As there is wrong to right, Wail of the weak against the strong, Or tyranny to fight; Long as there lingers gloom to chase, Or streaming tear to dry, One kindred woe, one sorrowing face That smiles as we draw nigh: Long as at tale of anguish swells The heart, and lids grow wet, And at the sound of Christmas bells We pardon and forget; So long as Faith with Freedom reigns, And loyal Hope survives, And gracious Charity remains To leaven lowly lives; While there in one untrodden tract For Intellect or Will, And men are free to think and act Life is worth living still. V Not care to live while English homes Nestle in English trees, And England's Trident-Sceptre roams Her territorial seas! Not live while English songs are sung Wherever blows the wind, And England's laws and England's tongue Enfranchise half mankind! So long as in Pacific main, Or on Atlantic strand, Our kin transmit the parent strain, And love the Mother-Land; So long as in this ocean Realm, Victoria and her Line Retain the heritage of the helm, By loyalty divine; So long as flashes English steel, And English trumpets shrill, He is dead already who doth not feel Life is worth living still. A VOICE FROM THE WEST I What is the voice I hear On the wind of the Western Sea? Sentinel, listen from out Cape Clear And say what the voice may be. “'Tis a proud, free people calling loud to a people proud and free. II “And it says to them, ‘Kinsmen, hail! We severed have been too long. Now let us have done with a worn-out tale— The tale of an ancient Wrong; And our friendship last long as Love doth last, and be stronger than Death is strong!’” III Answer them, “Sons of the self-same race, And blood of the self-same clan, Let us speak with each other face to face, And answer man to man; And loyally love and trust each other as none but free men can. IV “So fling them out to the breeze, Shamrock, Thistle, and Rose! And the Star-Spangled Banner unfurl with these, A message to friends and foes, Wherever the sails of peace are seen and wherever the war-wind blows. V “A message to bond and thrall to wake: For wherever we come, we twain, The throne of the tyrant shall rock and quake, And his menace be void and vain; For you are lords of a strong, young land, and we are lords of the main.” VI Yes, this is the voice on the bluff March gale: “We severed have been too long. But now we have done with a worn-out tale, The tale of an ancient Wrong; And our friendship shall last long as Love doth last, and be stronger than Death is strong!” March 1898. PAX BRITANNICA I Behind her rolling ramparts England lay, Impregnable, and girt by cliff-built towers, Weaving to peace and plenty, day by day, The long-drawn hours. II In peace Spring freed her flocks and showered her grain, Summer sate smiling under peaceful leaves, And Autumn piled on the unwarlike wain Her sickled sheaves. III And white-winged keels flew fluttering to her shore, Laden with Eastern bale or Southern fleece, And from the fields of far-off labour bore The spoils of Peace. IV Then, seeing Her within her waves so blest, The jealous nations, panoplied alike, Said, “Look, She wears no armour on her breast: What if we strike?” V But She, of their base greed and armed array Haughtily heedless, moated by her main, Still across ocean ploughed her peaceful way In strong disdain. VI Then each to other muttered, “Now at last Her splendour shall be ours, and we shall slake Our envy. She is pillowed on her Past, And will not wake.” VII Slowly as stirs a lion from his bed, Lengthens his limbs, and crisps his mane, She rose, Then shook out all her strength, and, flashing, said, “Where are my foes?” VIII Thus to herself She did herself reveal, Swiftly yet calmly put her armour on, And, round her Empire sentinelled in steel, Like morning shone! IX From field and forge there thronged embattled hosts, And that one struck the anvil, this the lyre, And from the furnaces of war her coasts Were fringed with fire. X Dazed and dismayed, they veiled their futile vow; Some fain would be her friend, and some would nurse Their hate till they could curb the might that now They could but curse. XI But they who watch from where the west wind blows, Since great themselves, proud that their kith are great, Said, “See what comes when England with her foes Speaks at the gate!” XII Then back to loom and share her people poured, Chanting peace-pæans as they reaped and gleaned, While, gazing worldward, on her undrawn sword Watchful She leaned. November 16, 1898. INFLEXIBLE AS FATE When for one brief dark hour Rome's virile sway Felt the sharp shock of Cannæ's adverse day, Forum, and field, and Senate-House were rent With cries of nor misgiving nor lament, Only of men contending now who should Purchase the spot on which the Victor stood. Legion on legion sprang up from the ground, Gleamed through the land, and over ocean wound, Till Scipio's eagles swarmed on Afric's shore, And Carthage perished, to insult no more. Not less resolved than Rome, now England stands Facing foul fortune with unfaltering hands. Throughout her Realms is neither fear nor feud, But, calm in strength and steeled in fortitude, She fills the gaps of death with eager life, That will nor lag nor haggle in the strife, Till, having backward rolled the lawless tide Of crafty treason, tyranny, and pride, Her Sword hath brought, inflexible as Fate, Charter of Freedom to a fettered State. November 1899. THE OLD LAND AND THE YOUNG LAND I The Young Land said, “I have borne it long, But can suffer it now no more; I must end this endless inhuman wrong Within hail of my own free shore. So fling out the war-flag's folds, and let the righteous cannons roar!” II 'Twas a quick, rash word, for the strong Young Land Is a Land whose ways are peace; It weareth no mail, and its keels are manned With cotton, and corn, and fleece, While lands there are that live cased in steel, and whose war-hammers never cease. III And these, when they saw the Young Land gird Its loins to redress the wrong, Whispered one to the other, “Its heart is stirred, But its hosts are an undrilled throng, And its bolts yet to forge, so quick let us strike before that it grows too strong.” IV And they said to the Old Land, “Surely you Will help us to foil its claim? It waxeth in strength, as striplings do, And it girds at its parent's name. Take heed lest its overweening growth overshadow your fading fame.” V Then the Old Land said, “Youth is strong and quick, And Wisdom is strong but mild; And blood than water is yet more thick, And this Young Land is my child. I am proud, not jealous, to watch it grow.” Thus the Old Land spake and smiled. VI “And look you,” it said, “at the strong Young Land Strike for Freedom and Freedom's growth; Which makes 'twixt us twain, though unsigned by hand, A bond strong as lovers' troth. So 'ware what you do, for, if you strike, you will strike not one, but both.” VII Then they fretted and chafed; for, though shod in steel, Their war-tread stops at the shore, While the Old Land's breath is the breath of the gale, And its music the wave-wind's roar. Then they hated the Young Land's youth and strength, but they hated the Old Land more. VIII Now the Old Land, in turn, for Freedom's Cause Speeds her sons to the Southern zone, They snarl, “Let us clip the Lion's claws, The Lion that stands alone; And harry her lair, and spear her cubs, and sit on the Lion's throne.” IX And the Young Land laughs: “With her foamsteeds fleet, I guess she's a match for you all. She hath saddled the sea, and more firm her seat Than yours, that would ride for a fall, If you put all your fighting force afield, and charged at her watery wall. X “But if ever, hemmed in by a world of foes, Her sinews were sorely tried, By the self-same blood in our veins that flows, You would find me at her side, So long as she strikes for the Cause for which her sons and my sons have died.” XI And thus let it be until wrong shall end, This bond strong as lovers' troth, 'Twixt Old Land and Young Land, to defend Man's freedom and freedom's growth, So if any should band against either now, they must meet, not one, but both! December 1899. TO ARMS! I Now let the cry, “To Arms! To Arms!” Go ringing round the world; And swift a wave-wide Empire swarms Round Battleflag unfurled! Wherever glitters Britain's might, Or Britain's banner flies, Leap up mailed myriads with the light Of manhood in their eyes; Calling from farmstead, mart, and strand, “We come! And we! And we! That British steel may hold the land, And British keels the sea!” II From English hamlet, Irish hill, Welsh hearths, and Scottish byres, They throng to show that they are still Sons worthy of their sires: That what these did, we still can do, That what they were, we are, Whose fathers fought at Waterloo, And died at Trafalgar! Shoulder to shoulder see them stand, Wherever menace be, To guard the lordship of the land And the Trident of the sea. III Nor in the parent Isle alone Spring squadrons from the ground; Canadian shore and Austral zone With kindred cry resound: “From shimmering plain and snow-fed stream, Across the deep we come, Seeing the British bayonets gleam, Hearing the British drum. Foot in the stirrup, hilt in hand, Free men, to keep men free, All, all will help to hold the land While England guards the sea!” IV Comrades in arms, from every shore Where thundereth the main, On to the front they press and pour To face the rifles' rain; To force the foe from covert crag, And chase them till they fall, Then plant for ever England's Flag Upon the rebel wall! What! Wrench the Sceptre from her hand, And bid her bow the knee! Not while her Yeomen guard the land, And her ironclads the sea! December 23, 1899. SPARTAN MOTHERS I “One more embrace! Then, o'er the main, And nobly play the soldier's part!” Thus sounds, amid the martial strain, The Spartan Mother's patriot heart. She hides her woe, She bids him go, And tread the path his Fathers trod. “Who dies for England, dies for God!” II In the husht night, she wakes, she weeps, And listens for the far-off fray. He scours the gorge, he scales the steeps, Scatters the Foe,—away! away! But feigned the flight! Smite, again smite! How fleet their steeds, how nimbly shod! She kneels, she prays—“Protect him, God!” III Weep, tender souls. The sob, the tear, The lonely prayer, the stifled wail, These brace the will, these nerve the spear, And speed him over veldt and vale. What is to him Or life or limb, Who rends the chain and breaks the rod! Who strikes for Freedom, strikes for God! IV Should Heaven decree that he once more Unscathed return to home and rest, She will be standing at the door, To fold him to her trembling breast. Or, should he fall By ridge or wall, And lie 'neath some green southern sod,— “Who dies for England, sleeps with God.” January 1900. THROUGH LIBERTY TO LIGHT Fixed is my Faith, the lingering dawn despite, That still we move through Liberty to Light. The Human Tragedy. I When God out of chaos primeval divided the day from the night, And moved on the face of the waters, ordaining, “Let there be Light!” And commanded the creatures that perish to people wave, wood, and wind, Then fashioned Man after His image, and gave him the godlike mind, He said, “I, the Lord, now make you lord of the earth, and the air, and sea, And I lend you My will to work My will, and now behold! you are free! II “Free to be strong or feeble, free to be false or true, To withhold you from evil-doing, or, what I shall ban, to do; Free to be crooked and craven, or fearless, and frank, and brave, To love as yourself your brother, or make him your bond and slave; To hallow the world with freedom, or fetter your fellow-men; But, as you shall do, at the Judgment Day My Justice will judge you then.” III Then the sons of men multiplied gladly, and, proud of the boon of birth, They teemed over main and mountain to the uttermost bounds of earth: They built up cities and Empires, Common-wealth, Throne, and State, And some were pillared on force and fraud, and some upon fear and hate. For the strong cared but to enjoy their strength, the mighty to use their might, And the vanquished were lashed to the victor's car, wherever his sword could smite. IV But out of the mist of the Northern Sea a blended race arose, Whose blood was warmed by the wind and the wave, and braced by the Winter snows; A race with the wisdom of long-linked years, yet the hopeful heart of youth, Who hated the lie and the liar, and dared both to speak and hear the truth; Who loved the Light for the Light's own sake, and, as none but who love it can, Kept the Torch of Liberty still aflame, and passed it from man to man. V And they circled the sea, and they girded the earth, and they spread round the rounded world, And the sound of their clarions never ceased, and never their flag was furled, And, wherever those shrilled, or this was seen, men sprang to their feet, and cried, “Now the Tyrant shall quake on his throne for fear, and the lash no more be plied; For the winds of Justice propel their sails, and Liberty steers their keel, And none but the lawless shall tremble now, and none but the haughty kneel. VI “At home in their white-cliffed, green-grassed Isle, where the woods and the waters meet, The King is honoured upon his throne, and the Judge revered in his seat, And each man's own is his own to keep, and safe from the robber's clutch, And the lowliest hearth hath sacred rights nor sceptre nor sword dare touch; And, as it doth on the Northern strand, so it doth in the Southern sea, And it says, as God said to Man at birth, ‘And now behold! you are free.’” VII But apart in the Southern sea there dwelt a race, though of Northern strain, With narrow foreheads and narrower hearts, who cherished the thong and chain, So long as these left their own limbs free to do as their brute wills list, To fetter and flog the sons of Ham, and to tether the stranger's wrist, Boasting, “Rather than not be free to make these hew for us, delve, and drudge, Let the hellhounds of War be all unleashed, and the battle-bolts be judge!” VIII Then the Land of the Northern mist waxed wroth, and said, “Now their hour has come. Too long to their deeds have mine ears been deaf, too long my voice been dumb. I will wrench the rod from their boorish grasp, their lash will I snatch and seize, Till low on their knees they grovel down, and for mercy clasp my knees. They have called on the sword, they shall bide by the sword, and mine will I never sheathe, Till to dwellers in darkness it bring the Light, and Freedom to all who breathe.” IX Then manly to tender kissed farewell, but never a tear was shed, And over the wave, and along with the wind, to the Southern zone they sped, The roughly-nurtured, the gently-bred, all bound on the self-same track, To storm the steeps and defiles of death, but never to turn them back; And their sons that on Austral or Western shores exult in their sires' renown, Shouted, “Barrel and blade, we'll come to you, and gallop the despots down.” X Shame, shame on you, Gaul and Teuton! that, seeing this noble deed, You have hardened your hearts for envy, and been false to your vaunted Creed; Should juggle with truth, should welcome the lie, should garble and gird for spite, Pray Heaven to favour the tyrants' cause, pray Heaven to hinder the Light. Hark, hark to the greeting of free-born men from the Land of the Setting Sun, “God prosper you, dear old England! It is rightly and nobly done.” XI Wherever our sails have quivered, wherever our keels have ploughed, We have carried the Flag of Freedom, unfurled it from mast and shroud. It hath weathered the storm of battle, it guardeth the paths of peace, And will watch over Right both day and night, till the day and the night shall cease; And, while there's a chain to shatter, and, while there's a wrong to right, Its watchword shall be God's gift to man, “Through Liberty, on to Light!” MAFEKING October 15, 1899—May 16, 1900 I Once again, banners, fly! Clang again, bells, on high, Sounding to sea and sky, Longer and louder, Mafeking's glory with Kimberley, Ladysmith, Of our unconquered kith Prouder and prouder. II Hemmed in for half a year, Still with no succour near, Nor word of hope to cheer Wounded and dying, Famished, and foiled of sleep By the fierce cannon's leap, They vowed still, still to keep England's Flag flying. III Nor was their mettle shown By male and strong alone, But, as intrepid grown, Fragile and tender, Without or tear or sigh, Echoed the brave old cry, “We, too, would rather die, Die than surrender.” IV As pressed the foe more near, Only with naked spear, Ne'er knowing what to fear, Parley, or blench meant, Forward through shot and shell, While still the foremost fell, They with resistless yell Stormed his intrenchment. V Then, when hope dawned at last, And fled the foe, aghast At the relieving blast Heard in the melley,— O our stout, stubborn kith! Kimberley, Ladysmith, Mafeking, wedded with Lucknow and Delhi! VI Sound for them martial lay! Crown them with battle-bay, Both those who died, and they 'Gainst death could wrestle: Powell of endless fame, All, all with equal claim, And, of the storied name, Gallant young Cecil! VII Long as the waves shall roll, Long as Fame guards her scroll, And men through heart and soul Thrill to true glory, Their deed, from age to age, Shall voice and verse engage, Swelling the splendid page Of England's Story.</field>
