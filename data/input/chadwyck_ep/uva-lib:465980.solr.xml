      <field name="fulltext">IN AN INDIAN TEMPLE. It was a Temple, white and fair, Piercing the warm blue Indian air With painted cupola; and set High on a hill-side, where there met Two streams‚Äîwith sister-kiss of wave‚Äî Which rippled lightly down, to lave Our Deccan flats, gliding to grow Beema‚Äîand Kistna next‚Äîand flow By many a peopled plain and lea Into the Coromandel sea. And all along those shining banks Neem and acacia trees in ranks Shaded the flood, making cool homes Of leafy peace for all that comes To river-side, the pheasant-crow, The jay, the coppersmith whose blow‚Äî In his green smithy stoutly plied Ringing from dawn till eventide‚Äî Falls ‚Äòklink, klank, klink,‚Äô upon the ear; And social weavers who, from fear Of thievish snakes, their nests suspend Swinging from every branchlet's end: There, too, the nine brown sisters talked; The silver-feathered egret stalked; The muchi-baug‚Äî‚Äútiger of fish‚Äù‚Äî Shot from the air with arrowy swish And soared again‚Äîhis pearly prey Clutched in red talons. All the day You heard the necklaced jungle-dove Cooing low songs of ceaseless love; While, brooding near, his listening wife With soft breast warmed her eggs to life; And, from the hot vault of the sky The circling kite made fierce reply; For Love and Hate were neighbours still Even upon that holy hill! Yet, in the Temple all seemed peace. There‚Äîsitting upon Shiva's knees‚Äî Parvati, shaped in gold, was seen,‚Äî With great eyes jewelled‚ÄîShiva's Queen: And nigh them, in the inmost dusk, Ganpati, known by broken tusk And trunk of elephant. No sound Stirred the deep quiet of that ground Where the Gods dwelled, save footfall rare Of Hindoo wife or maid, with fare Of coloured rice or honeyed cake For Shiva's Priest, and vows to make Before the shrine in some dear name; Save, also, when the pigeons came, A blue cloud, whirring from the wood To peck their daily Temple-food. If other echo silence broke 'Twas Govind murmuring Sanskrit shloke From ancient scrolls, or chanting prayers Three times a day, Govind who bears‚Äî Immeasurably wise‚Äîthe weight Of threescore learn√´d years and eight, Shiva's calm servant. Sometimes, you Would hear within that Temple, too, Gunga the Nautch-girl's anklets chime Dancing in some grave measured rhyme Before the Gods, to throb of drum And low-played pipe, or, with deft thumb Twangling the tight-stretched vina-string To yield shrill notes, while she did sing Of Love‚Äîas Nautchnees know‚Äîand praise Of lovers dead for Love; and lays Of wounded hearts and piercing eyes; Which grey Philosophies despise. Good friends were dancing girl and priest To one I knew, such friends‚Äîat least‚Äî As those may be whom Fortune gives Stars wide apart and differing lives: And Gunga to the Saheb would sing Sweet Indian songs for pleasuring; And Govind‚Äîpatient with their folly‚Äî Would listen, mild and melancholy, Till nobler moments rose, and then Speak wisely on the ways of men, The worlds of Gods, the wisdom hid In Upan√Æshad, Pooran, Ved: Nay, and sometimes, with careful finger, On some dark text and comment linger, Sifting its sacred meanings o'er‚Äî As when in burning Ratnapoor The ruby-miners wash away Gravel and dust and yellow clay To leave at last one jewel bare, ‚ÄòPigeon-blood‚Äô colour, faultless, rare! Which to the finder freedom brings, And glows, in seal or crown of kings. On such a day those sate together Under the sky of splendent weather Which shines in Poush, and held debate‚Äî Friendly or petulant‚Äîwith weight Of Govind's lore at one time heard, And then‚Äîlike some loud ‚Äútit-wee‚Äù bird‚Äî The Nautch-girl mocking all save Love; Anon, demure as any dove, Listening to wisdom; and, again, Falling with laughter to some strain Ill-fitted to the theme: But sit In Temple-shade, and judge of it! Saheb. Pandit! You promised me to read to-day That Upan√Æshad where the Sanskrit tells The inner meanings of your mystic Word, The Word we must not utter till we meet Privately here, with foolish ears away. P. Yea! the Mand√ªkya! hast thou conned the text? S. It was so hard and rugged none might read As little taught as I. The words were plain, But not the sense. 'Twas like a rain-time cloud Blown by the wind, sending far thunder forth, Which seemed to bring some message if man's ear Had wit to comprehend. P. It hath such wit If it will listen well; and thou may'st learn More than thy Sages know beyond the seas, Pondering Mand√ªkya; for the leaves recite What lies within that Word we must not speak Where Mlechchas are. S. Well! will you say it now? P. I sin‚Äîthe Book being so majestical, And thou no twice-born‚Äîif I teach thee this; Save that thou lovest our Land, and lov'st to tread All paths of knowledge. But is Gunga there? S. I saw her scattering pulse to feed the doves When I rode in, and‚Äîhark! her vina plays! You will not stay our study for the girl? [Gunga enters, holding a Vina. She salutes the Priest and the Englishman.] Gunga. Swasti! my holy Rishi! Maharaj, Salaam! Bid me not go‚ÄîMahadev's girl‚Äî Who dances for the pleasure of the Gods, And brings the temple treasure. See, rupees! I got them singing yesternight: mine eyes Pierced the Rao Saheb to the heart, which bled Plentiful gifts; yet had he nought from me Save one kiss on the brow. Ah, Mera Jan! My English Lord; I know a song on that: [She plays and sings] ‚ÄúMy Lotus-eyed‚Äîmy Love that loves me now‚Äî She lets me touch the tilka on her brow, And mouth as soft as are the bimba-leaves, And little rounded chin, whence love perceives The smooth brown neck sink to that tender place Where the heart beats between two hills of grace. ‚ÄúBut, when I would have kissed the rose-red peaks Of those dear mountains,‚Äîas a pilgrim seeks To worship on the highest spot‚Äîshe cried: ‚ÄòNay, nay! my choli must not be untied!‚Äô So trips she off, as from the tamarind-spray A light hen-ko√Øl, in her mate's mid lay.‚Äù S. Oh, Gunga! if you vex the Pandit's soul He will not read, and I shall miss to know What says Mand√ªkya. Sit and learn this lore,‚Äî If you may hear it. P. Nay, the girl can hear! I am too old for anger, and she bears A gentle breast, and serves our Temple well, Though all too light of mind, and loose of tongue. G. Dear Master! make me wise! Gunga is good When you will teach; and what should Sahebs know A Nautchnee must not hear? The gates are shut; The Temple-birds are fed; sometimes I think‚Äî When only they and I are in the Court, And I sit watching how they pace about, With red feet like to mine, all henna-stained, And barred backs, like my striped and painted cloth; And jewels round their throats, like these I wear! When I sit watching how they pace and plume, Bridling their necks, and making melting eyes, And sidling here and there, and spreading wings, And wooing and pursuing, with one song Of ‚Äòlove-love-love,‚Äô and do not fear the Gods, But pick dropped rice from Shiva's awful feet;‚Äî Oh, then I think these be dead Nautch-dancers Come back to the glad light to coo, and serve, And seek old lovers! There's a verse on that: [Gunga sings and plays] ‚ÄúResolve me‚Äîelement by element‚Äî Into the Void, oh God! I am content, So I may only be, for him I love, The water in his tank, the winds that rove Around his brows, the light that serves his needs, The fire that warms him, and the soil that feeds.‚Äù Say! you two wise ones! is not that as deep As your Vedantas? S. But you do not tell Which of past many lovers is to drink Gunga made water; cool his fevered brows With Gunga blowing sweet; and cook his rice With Gunga, blazing bright! G. The last, my Lord! All others I forget! P. Thou foolish Soul, Who, losing thine own house, would'st help to build Another perishable form! What's he, Or thou, or any, but a wave which lifts Out of Brahm's ocean‚Äîto sink back again? Seek to grow one with Him, and rather say: ‚ÄúYea! dear Lord! we are one with Thee! since Thou art all in all! And our lives in Thy Life must end; yet dare I never call Thee mine, as I am Thine, oh God! The Wave is still the Sea's! The Sea is not the Wave's, therefor! So I, and all of these!‚Äù S. That makes you solemn, Gunga! Keep your eyes Curtained with lashes just one little while! Now for this dread Word‚ÄîOM. P. Oh!‚Äînot like that!‚Äî Reach me the lota, girl! that I may wash My mouth from stain: then, covering one hand, I raise this other to my lips, and say, With three half-breaths drawn in,‚Äîbut slow and low‚Äî The three great matras of this mighty Word Which is as Silence spoken! Hear'st thou?‚ÄîOM!‚Äî S. How are there three? P. 'Tis made of A,‚ÄîU,‚ÄîM: And last the vindu binding all in one, Which one is holiest of all uttered speech, Sweet to the Gods, consummate, good to say At all the Samdhyas,‚Äîwhen Night joineth Morn, Morning the Afternoon, and Evening Night; Good to repeat before we read the Veds, And when we finish; locking all truths up As the womb holds the life, as rocks hide gems, And seeds the leaf, flower, fruit. A Scripture saith ‚ÄúOM is the bow; the Arrow is the Soul; Brahm is the object: he who shooteth straight Pierceth the target of the Uttermost, Attaineth end.‚Äù ‚ÄúMeditate OM!‚Äù it saith: ‚ÄúFor, in that mystic light, the knowers know Brahm without body, parts, or passions‚ÄîBrahm Joyful, Eternal, All-embracing, Pure.‚Äù This Word hath all words in it, all three names Of Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu; all three worlds‚Äî Earths, Ethers, Heavens; and all three modes of Time Past, Present, Future; all three sexes, too, Yoni, and Lingam, and what yoketh both; And all three Veds! See! on yon banyan-branch Which overhangs our wall, two parroquets! There is a Scripture‚Äîthird of Mundaka‚Äî Telleth of that, so as a man may read Who knoweth OM. Two Birds‚Äîit sayeth‚Äîsit, Always united, always equal-plumed, Perched on one fig-tree branch. This pecks the fruit That feedeth not, but gazeth‚Äîwitnessing;‚Äî And She who eateth is the Human Soul, And he who watcheth is the Soul Divine, And Life the Fig-tree is, and Life's delights Its too sweet fruit. But, if one knoweth OM, The feeding bird looks on the watching bird‚Äî Its mate immortal, scorning those false fruits‚Äî And leaveth all, to join the ‚ÄúAll of All;‚Äù Saved by right sight, lifted on wiser wings To better pleasures;‚Äîas, see! now they fly‚Äî Those green birds,‚Äîhigh into the stainless Blue! Oh, look you, Friend! when the great Gods would hear What Brahm was, unto Indra came they all Asking this thing, glorious as yonder clouds Which flock towards the throne of the sinking Sun, Ruby and amethyst, and pearl and gold; And Indra bade them sit beneath a tree‚Äî The Nyagrodha tree‚Äînor spake he once, Through twenty thousand moons, to that bright throng Of seated Gods; but at the last he spake Saying, with fingers on his hushed lips, ‚ÄúOM!‚Äù Then all the Gods went to their places wise. S. And you are wise, good Pandit! Yet I long To hear this scroll, and Gunga burns to hear; She did not glean such treasure from the hand Of you Rao Saheb! To the Nautch Girl.] Slack your vina-strings, And sit in closer! You've no song for that: G. How know you, Maharaj? There's drum and dance For all the moods;‚ÄîMahadev's girl can sing Many like this: [She sings and plays] ‚ÄúBecause I have not served Thee right, oh, sweet and mighty Lord! Thou wilt not less deliverance, and rest with Thee afford; Who drinks of bless√´d Amrit,‚Äîthough it be with dying lips,‚Äî Lives, and grows well and pure again, at the first drop he sips.‚Äù But let my music sleep! Now will I listen! P. I shall read the text In brief lines‚Äîas it runs‚Äîthen make all plain. ‚ÄúNama Param√¢tmane Hari! OM! OM! Amity√™tad Aksharam idan Sarvvan tasyopavy√¢khy√¢nan bh√ªt!‚Äù‚Äî Which meaneth, ‚ÄúGlory in the Highest! OM! The Immeasurable! This is immortal! OM! This is the One! This word, interpreted, Is what was in beginning, and is now, And ever shall be‚ÄîOM embraceth those‚Äî The threefold modes of Life, and what's beyond Unmeted by them. OM is that, and all!‚Äù ‚ÄúSarvvan hy√™tadbrahm√¢yamatma‚Äù‚ÄîOM, So spoken of the All, is Brahm: the soul Is Brahm: yet here this soul goes chatusp√¢t ‚ÄúFour-footed;‚Äù owns conditions four. Observe How these be packed in OM! S. Now, Gunga, list! Why do you smile? G. I wonder why I sang These wistful words, of late, to one I loved: [She sings and plays] ‚ÄúWhat should I say at hour of parting hateful? If I sigh ‚Äòleave me not!‚Äô that seems ungrateful! If I should whisper ‚Äògo‚Äô it sounds so coldly; And to cry ‚Äòstay‚Äô were to command too boldly; ‚ÄòGo, if thou wilt,‚Äîstay, if thou wilt!‚Äô‚Äîthis savours Of heedless heart; while full of Fate's ill-favours 'Twould be to murmur, ‚ÄòIf we part, I die!‚Äô Lest that fall true: alas! I know not‚ÄîI‚Äî What thing to utter! Teach me some wise word To say when you must leave me, Dearest Lord!‚Äù Now, had I known‚Äî‚ÄúOm‚Äù was the word to speak, Which all thoughts compasses. S. You feather, blown From pea-hen's neck at pairing-time, be still! Now, Pandit! tell us these conditions four. P. Prathamah p√¢dah, Sir! Vai?v√¢nara. ‚ÄúThe first condition is ‚ÄòVai?v√¢nara.‚Äô‚Äù Now, this word signifieth ‚ÄòConsciousness,‚Äô Common to all men (vai?va-nar), and so Intendeth common waking life, that state Wherein we eat and drink, and see and smell, And hear and touch and taste. The holy script Sayeth, ‚ÄòVai?v√¢nara is waking life; Whereof the knowledge is of outward things Cheating the sense. Seven organs hath this life, And mouths nineteen. It feedeth on the Gross.‚Äô G. Oh, Shiva! Nineteen mouths! How one might kiss! S. Which are the organs seven; and which those mouths Twenty less one? P. The books speak diversely; Yet our chief sages teach the organs seven Of waking life, are‚Äîfor the Head the Heavens, For Eye the Sun, for Breath the moving Wind, For Heart the Ether, for the Humours, Sea, For Feet the Earth, for Heat the inner Fires. Also those nineteen mouths are nineteen doors Whereby the world hath access to the Self; And these be‚Äîthe five modes of Intellect, The five Sense-gateways, the five Vital airs; With Mind, Will, Individual Consciousness, And Chittam, which is sense behind the sense, That whereby sight of eye, and touch of skin, And taste, and smell, and sound are cognited. Such is Vai?v√¢nara‚Äîthe waking Life‚Äî The letter A denoteth it in AUM. S. And what is U? P. It standeth in the Word For Taijasa, second of living states, Which hath its name from tejas‚Äî‚Äúbrilliancy,‚Äù Being that gleam which thou shalt see with eyes Fast shut, when all the gloom danceth in sparks, And, on the inner lids the lingering light Paints stars and rings of spangled phantasy; For Taijasa is slumber, when we dream, And the scroll saith: it hath the organs seven, The gates nineteen, but knoweth inner things, And‚Äîpraviviktabhuk‚Äîin sightless sleep It ‚Äúfeedeth on the Subtle.‚Äù G. Ah! I know Your Taijasa! when I have danced all night, And draw my cloth, at last, across my eyes, I see the Temple-lamps pale and more pale Inside my lids, all down the road to sleep; Till at the end there comes a softer light Which needs no eyes; and there I lie, and dream! S. What dream you of, my Gungabaee? G. Of gold So much it bursts my cloth! of beauteous gems Hung on my neck by some one loving me; Or 'tis a Prince who sends me cardamums Which mean ‚Äúyour breath is Heaven!‚Äù or sandal-wood Chipped small, which is to say, ‚ÄúIn seeing you I become water!‚Äù or stick-cinnamon Which signifies ‚Äúmy life is thine!‚Äù Sometimes I dream the gods rise from their seats, and wink Their jewelled eyes, and tell me where to find Blue lotus for their shrines, or where there lies A buried pot of mohours; sometimes, too, I see two elephants that fight and fight Without their mahoots‚Äîthat means death! or see Lotuses grown in sand, and that means love From unexpected places; or I spy Holes in the moon and serpents with ten mouths, And those, I know, bring ill! But it is good To dream of fire-flies, mirrors, thrones, and fish, And rice, and rainbows: yestereve I dreamed A black calf sucked a brindled heifer's bag, And that, be sure, shows losses; so I brought A jar of milk to-day for Parvati. P. Yea, Nautchni, yea! that is the waking light Glimmering in visions; that is Taijasa! Yet so‚Äîif thou wert wiser‚Äîshouldst thou see Innermost things, ev'n dreaming; nay, and so Thou, too, dost pass into a deeper sleep, Life's third Condition. S. And the name of this?‚Äî P. The name, Sahebji! is Prajna, letter M Of those three letters of the mighty Word. Here, very plain our ancient writing runs! Yatra supno na kanchan kamayat√™ Kaman, na kanchan svapnan pa?yati‚Äî ‚ÄúWhen he asleep desireth no desire, Dreameth no dreams, that is the perfect sleep‚Äî Sushupnan‚Äîthat is Prajna; then he lives!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe, lying thus,‚Äù it saith, ‚Äúlieth, grown one With all which is; that which he knows he knows By knowledge unified; his peace is peace Perfect, except for ceasing; bliss he tastes As taste the Gods, and‚Äîch√™tomukh‚Äîhis mouth Is Wisdom's portal. He is Lord of all, All-sharing, ruling inner things, a soul Whence springeth life as from a Yoni‚Äîso He maketh and unmaketh.‚Äù Such is M, The third great matra. S. Yet resolve me this, How ‚Äòmaketh and unmaketh?‚Äô what is life Its senses chained in sleep? P. Suffer me, Sir! To answer from Brihad√¢raranyaka Where Raja Janaka holds deep discourse With Yajnavalkya, and the good Prince asked, ‚ÄúBy what light lives the Soul?‚Äù The Brahman said: It liveth here by sunlight, using eyes; And lacking sunlight, by the gleam of the moon; And, if there be no moon, or sun, by fire; And if the fire fails, then by sound or touch; But if no sound is heard, and all be void, Then is the Soul sufficing light to Soul. For dwelling in the hollow of the heart, Girt by the senses as a king by slaves, Being left alone it riseth, lights its lamp, And, wandering down the borders of two worlds, Seemeth to think, yet watcheth what is thought; Seemeth to move, but stays unchangeable. Then fall away from Soul the ills it took Assuming form; like Handmaids, Sleep and Night Strip it of those; it goes majestical, And sees two lives, on this and that side; one Here of this Earth, and in another World Another not yet known, between which winds‚Äî With banks and shoals that shift, now nearer Life, Now nearer Death‚Äîthe placid channel of Sleep, Like a black, shadowy, hidden, windless stream Whose silent waters lave both lands, and bear The Spirit on its tranquil boat of flesh Hither and thither. Gliding wistfully Down that dividing flood the Soul, secure, Seeth both shores, and bringeth what it will From that to this, and taketh what it will, And ‚Äúmaketh and unmaketh.‚Äù Horses, roads, Or chariots are there none in Shadow-Land, Yet the Soul willeth these, and see! it drives, Horsed, glorious, eager, through the boundless Murk! No bliss, no kiss, no large delights be there Of beautiful kind faces lit with love; Of soft arms shutting into Paradise; Yet the Soul wills there be, and lo! that Dark Is filled with companies of Apsar√¢s, Lovely and sweet all mortal maids beyond‚Äî Sweeter than Rambha whom R√¢vana wooed! There are no tanks, no palaces, no trees, Nor feasts, nor dances; but the Soul doth will, And, see! the Dark grows gracious with great walls Built on the void, ramps of red gold, and domes Of cloud-poised marble, and fair cloistered courts Where wave the feathers of the palms, and flit Swift glistering shoals of fish in lilied pools; And dancers, rosy-footed, and bright-eyed, Melt the glad soul to love. Subduing flesh By spell of sleep he‚Äînot himself asleep‚Äî Sees his sense slumbering, and moves away Free as the mated bird launching from branch. The Life-breath keeps the nest‚Äîthe Soul flies off, To go and come in that wide Realm of Rest Making its manifold shapes, unmaking them; Rejoicing in the arms of Dream-maidens; Laughing with lovely friends, moving at will On wondrous wings of thought; arriving swift At splendid sights, or strange, or tragical, And sometimes terrible‚Äîfor fear is dear As well as joy! Yet, though thou know'st that Land, Thou shalt not meet the Soul there, nay‚Äînor mark Where in the viewless vast it wandereth. Therefore, let no man wake one suddenly, Lest Soul return not well from its long way! And Y√¢jnavalkya said: The Soul,‚Äîthus roaming, Thus, like a falcon, flying here and there From cliff to cliff of sleep's far boundaries, Seeing the glad and sad, the old and new, The good and ill,‚Äîpresently wearieth. Then doth it fold its pinions and sink down Into Soul's nest, reaching the dreamless Peace Prajna. There follow not to that deep state, Gladness or sadness, good or evil. Life Is lifted out of living‚ÄîSoul grows Brahm! Nor let one say ‚Äòit seeth‚Äîheareth not!‚Äô That which doth see and hear is Self;‚Äîeye, ear Were instruments, laid down: who used them keeps Light of his own, sound of his own, touch, taste Other than ours! Such is the letter M, Third matra of the Holy Word. S. I ask, Right-learn√´d Friend! why Good and Evil cease Because Soul sleeps? P. Surely such names subsist In worlds of ‚Äòthine and mine,‚Äô of ‚Äòthis and that,‚Äô Of ‚Äòpraise and blame!‚Äô Where all things melt in one Evil and Good are fled, to plague no more. S. Well! who may judge? In England‚Äîover-sea, Our Gunga here, that is so kind and gay; Who loves the Gods, and gives to all the poor, And would not hurt a grey gnat, if it stung; And built the Dharma-S√¢la (Nay! you did!), And knows all dances, and a hundred songs; And holds her trade as honest as the best:‚Äî With us she would rank viler than with you Yon Mhar, that must not touch a Brahman's cloth. G. By Shiva's snakes! Out there are all so pure? S. Not all! Yet we have built the House of Love With Christian stones, and each man chooses love Not by some other's will‚Äîas here with you‚Äî But for himself; and each will have his love‚Äî If such may be‚Äîwhite as the Champak-bud When first its green cup splits. G. And fares it well With those cold blossoms, in the homes they find? S. Yes, Gunga! nobly well in honest homes! For lovely is the flower of chastity, Lasting its fragrance, and its fruit more fair Than chance fruits borne on boughs whence all may pluck. And goodly is the air of Liberty For all, but most for lovers, seeing Love Knows more than Wisdom, and because young hearts Choose better than their elders, being taught By Nature, 'ware of inmost sympathy, And subtle suitings of this blood and that To blend together for fresh human veins. So life's long road goes happier for the grace Of good beginnings! You and I may praise The white flower on the rock we cannot reach! Oh, and full well I know what happy hearths Are here in India, and what stainless wives Live their sweet lives and die their gentle deaths Under your suns. G. My mother vowed me this‚Äî A Deva-Dasa, servant to the God‚Äî To save my father's life, when she did go Great with me. And my father rose, made whole After that vow; and, then, they married me‚Äî New-born‚Äîwith garlands and the mangal-shloke Wife to the ‚ÄúDagger;‚Äù and they laid red rice Upon my head, and taught me how to dance, Play vina, plait my hair with flowers, and make Great eyes for money. Must I be ashamed? S. Not before me, my Sister! It were well Certain most faultless ones were half as good, As gentle-souled! But, Govind! at the last Is not Good good, and Evil evil? Brahm‚Äî If He be All in All‚Äîmust deal as Lord With all three states of OM. Note, too, that verse Of Katha Upan√Æshad, ‚ÄúWhat is here Visible in our world, is also there In Brahm's invisible world; and what is there That same is here unseen.‚Äù P. It is so writ! S. Then, by good leave, your Indian systems lack Two points we Westerns boast‚Äîthe love of man For God's love, Who hath made him; and this Law‚Äî That because Right is right we follow Right. P. Give me example, Sir! that I may judge. S. Well! I remember one! But tell me first Is it good Hindoo rule a wife should live Faithful to death unto her husband's bed? P. Yea, by a hundred Shasters! S. Yet again, Is it good Hindoo rule if one who starves Craves food, the householder shall surely give? P. Yea! and our Scriptures say:‚ÄúIf one shall bar The door against an asker, when he goes Hungry away, he leaves his own sins there, And takes the good deeds of the householder.‚Äù S. But which of these two duties is the first? P. Neither is first or last. Both must be kept! S. Then judge hereof. There dwelt a householder In Gaya, where the twin streams wander down‚Äî Nil√¢jan and Moh√¢na. Just and mild This Brahman was, dutiful unto all, In life's bright prime, a goodly man to view, Whom fairest wives might worship. So, indeed, Sita loved Balaram. No new-wed bride Ever more gladsome paced the seven steps, Shared the dyed rice, or wore the golden cloth, And iron bangle: nor, in all that land Shone sweeter face bearing the marriage-mark Stamped with vermilion. These two loved‚ÄîI say‚Äî Like Krishna and like Radha. Oh, you know! At coming home, when the white stars peep forth, And all your Indian sky turns purple peace, 'Twas ‚ÄúSonarchund! My moon of gold! art safe? I lived with half my life, whilst thou wert gone! Ah, didst thou think on me all day?‚Äù And he, ‚ÄúMy Pomegranate! my Pearl! whose arms are Heaven, And mouth as sweet as new Ke√¥ra-buds, How could I think of you, my heart being here?‚Äù G. Why, that's a song we sing! The air goes so: [She sings and plays] ‚ÄúThink on me, Dear! you said, at parting; But this I did not do; Without my heart I could not think, And it remained with you.‚Äù S. Well! thus they loved. But then the Famine fell: Indra was angry, and his brazen skies Cooled with no cloud, and let no sweet rain fall. In wood and nullah forest creatures died Pining for drink: the shyest beasts drew in To lap at village wells; the thirsting snake Crept to the mud-hole, where the snake-bird drooped Too parched to strike! The green crops died to grey, And famished people fed on jungle-meats‚Äî Berries and roots‚Äîfor half a seer of rice Sold at two annas, and jow√¢ree went Thirty rupees the candy! Balaram Nourished his quarter while the bags held grain, Then fell to lack and leanness, with the rest; To sorer lack, because, when there was food Upon his household fire, the good man lied A loving lie, saying:‚ÄúI ate to-day With Kerupunt‚Äîor Lakhsman!‚Äù‚Äîso that she Might take her fill, and keep her beauty bright. Was one, inside the city, loved this wife Unhonestly‚ÄîVittoo the wealthy Sett, Who sold the starving towns-folk pulse, yet kept His grain-pits filled, hoarding the precious store. And many a time‚Äîwhen Sita came to buy‚Äî The man would say, measuring less niggard seers, ‚ÄúOh, Rose of our sad garden! rice is dear; Hardly, except to thee, have I to sell! By Shiva! but I cheapen this for thee! Yet wouldst thou once‚Äîonce only‚Äîof fair grace‚Äî Be kind to him who worships where he sees The foot-mark of thy feet; once, only once!‚Äî Lest Death come 'ere my soul's desire be had;‚Äî Then would I load thy cloth with bhat and dall, Asking no price.‚Äù And she would answer, proud, ‚ÄúI hate thee, Vittoo, for thy wicked love; My Lord will kill thee if I speak of this, Or sit and starve rather than buy from thee. Give me my grain, and let me go!‚Äù Whereat The Sett's heart burned in secret, and his gains Joyed him no more; for, always, day and night The face of Sita drew him like a spell. P. Ah, that a mortal man will sin so deep! S. Now‚Äîone day‚Äîat the worst; when Balaram Was gone a-seeking bambu-seed to eat; And Sita's self had tasted nought from dawn, The last rice being cooked, the last gem sold, The last poor cowrie spent, there came a Sage Asking this wife for food. Reverend he seemed, Of pious mien and speech‚Äîa Rishi, sure! Wearing the saffron-coloured garb, and marked With Shiva's lines upon his wrinkled brow. ‚ÄúGive me to eat, Fair Daughter! for I die To-day, at sunset, if I touch no meal!‚Äù So craved he, with low voice, blessing the house, And therewith sank within the threshold-stone, Piteous to note, so holy and so wan; This hope his last! Then sprang the bitter tears To Sita's gentle eyes; faltered her lips; Beat her true heart as though to burst.‚ÄîDear Heaven! What shall she say? If she shall say, ‚ÄúThis house Is emptied, Father! not one bajri-ear Is left thy servants!‚Äù‚Äîthen the grief, the shame, To see him creep away, whom Shastras bid Succour and honour! And, if she shall say, ‚ÄúMy Lord is absent, he will bring us food!‚Äù Who knows? who knows? Balaram may not find Till nightfall, or may come bringing no meal; And ere that hour the Rishi will lie dead! But oh! if now‚Äîto save this life‚Äîshe say, ‚ÄúI have no grain, yet, Maharaj! I know The means to win some;‚Äù (Gunga! had you felt Her veins throb while she thought it!) would he not Enquire the means, and, learning, choose to die Rather than she should stain her soul, and truck Heart's love and household joys and blameless name For half a maund of rice! She must not tell! He shall not die! Ah, Balaram, forgive! Ah, High Gods! help her find the rightful path! She led that holy man tenderly in, And, sweetly smiling, wiped her tears away, And sighed:‚ÄúBe pleased to rest! thy handmaid goes To fetch thee food; presently thou shalt eat!‚Äù G. Now, stay not, Saheb! This is more than songs! P. Yes, Nautchni! But, I wonder, did she go? S. She drew her sari round her head, and stepped Into the street. Time was, when Sita passed, Neighbours would give her greeting, pleased to hear The music of her anklets, glad to catch The sunlight of her glance; now went she sad No friend regarding; for the ways were void; Or, if a foot-fall sounded, 'twas of men Haggard and gaunt, who moaned, with lips drawn tight, ‚ÄúHast thou to help us, Sister?‚Äù stalking on When, for all answer‚Äîwith her tears in flood‚Äî She stretched an empty palm. Once and again A mother with lean arms held high her babe, Saying:‚ÄúBuy this, sweet Lady! for so much As one small pot of rice, before I die!‚Äù And, thrice, in mid-bazaar, she met unveiled With faces wild, wearing a ragged cloth, Stripped of their gems, and gnawing food unfit, Proud purdah women, whom in days gone by No stranger's eye had looked on; now they walked Hungry and unabashed, their beauty marred, Their soft feet stained with mire. No townsman asked, ‚ÄúBalaram's wife, where goest thou?‚Äù The dead Lay silent, and the dying found no voice; But unto Sita's throbbing heart it seemed As though the sun glared hard, as though the wind Went mocking her, blowing her sari back To strip the harlot's face. All down the street House windows gazed upon her; Peepal-trees‚Äî Which know the things men do, and tell the Gods‚Äî Whispered her desperate deed with rustling leaves One to another, and the clamorous crows Cawed scorn against her. So with painful steps Came she to Vittoo's door. The Sett salaamed: ‚ÄúFortunate day!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúGood day and glad Which brings again to us that lotus-face! In what thing may thy servant pleasure Thee?‚Äù And Sita‚Äîhiding all except her eyes‚Äî Made answer, speaking slow and shamedly, ‚ÄúThere is come one who must not be denied Unto our house; he craveth food:‚Äîwill die If none be given; and we have none to give. Thou hast desired me: measure now for me Six seers of rice, and tie it in my cloth Asking no money, for our last is spent:‚Äî And this night, when the houses are all shut I will come hither,‚Äîas thou prayedst me.‚Äù No word he spake, but with a trembling mouth Kissed her feet, bending down; then filled her cloth, Not measuring the grain. So Sita came Back to her home, and set the chatty on, And‚Äîboiling rice‚Äîserved to that holy man; Who ate with brightening eyes, and took farewell; First raising to his grateful lips the hem Of Sita's garment:‚ÄúBe it well with thee, Fair Daughter!‚Äù said he, ‚Äúfor thy charity, Here and hereafter!‚Äù Entered Balaram Presently‚Äîbringing jungle-roots; but laid His bitter food aside, smelling the rice. ‚ÄúOh, gem of women!‚Äù cried he, ‚Äúwhence is this? How hast thou conjee, when I could not find One friend in all the town, with half a seer?‚Äù ‚ÄúDear Lord!‚Äù Sita replied, ‚Äújudge me herein Ere thou dost eat! There came a holy man, Of pious mien and speech‚Äîa Rishi, sure‚Äî Reverend to see, wearing the saffron robe, Who craved for food, and moaned, ‚ÄòGive, or I die!‚Äô‚Äù All this she told‚Äîand how she cast about Not having food, nor daring to endure Her Lord's hearth should be shamed by churlish deed‚Äî ‚ÄúFor thou, I know,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúhad given thy blood To help a Rishi!‚Äù‚Äîhow‚Äîher Lord being gone‚Äî Means must be found. Then piteous she went on: ‚ÄúThou did'st not think‚ÄîI could not tell‚Äîforgive! Vittoo the Sett these many days hath cast Vile eyes of longing on me, praying me‚Äî Once, and once only,‚Äîlest he die unjoyed‚Äî To grant him that‚Äîwhich is for thee alone. And I have spit upon him, praying thus. But now‚Äîin such sore need‚Äîjudge me, dear Lord! Seeing that holy man at point to die, Thyself away, and nothing left,‚Äîsave this, I fetched six seers from Vittoo‚Äîpromising That this night, when the houses are all shut, I would go there, and give‚Äîwhat he hath asked.‚Äù Silent he stood awhile, with limbs braced hard, And breath caught back, and blood chilled in his veins, As when afield th' unwitting antelope Sees the lithe cheetah spring, and knows it death. The next fierce instant in his breast his hand Fumbled the handle of his jungle-knife, And settled where to strike‚Äîthere! twixt the breasts! Straight to that bartered heart! Then, a long sigh Brake from his soul, and‚Äîas she sank, full length, Sobbing upon his feet‚Äîthe rage‚Äîthe hate, The tempest of his thunderous misery, His husband's wrath‚Äîhis man's fond passion‚Äîpassed From lips and eyes, as, on a stormy noon The shadows of the lightning-cloud, which lay Black on the hill-side, flit; and sunshine gleams. ‚ÄúThou hast done well!‚Äù he said, with breaking voice, ‚ÄúAnd rightly, Sita! though I would the flames Had fed on me ere this. It was not meet To let the Guru die‚Äînot possible! And thou hadst no more means;‚Äîand I away. I thought to kill thee, Dear! whilst thou didst speak; Then thought to slay the Sett;‚Äîbut that is past! Thou hast not sinned, Fair Wife! seeking to pay My duty's price, and finding nought to give Save thy sweet self. 'Tis hard we lived for this Who will be dead anon; yet we should keep‚Äî Must keep‚Äîour plighted word. Therefore to-night, Thou art this man's! I part thy savoury rice Into two portions; one I bid thee eat‚Äî Thou must not faint before thou payest our debt‚Äî This other I will take to Venkatrao Whose children famish. Now then, dress thy hair! No! not i' the old way; not that pretty way When I was wont to plunge my lips in its silk; But as they use who do this trade; and scent Thy breasts with musk, and paint thy lids, and stain Thy feet and hands with mehndi.‚Äù ‚ÄúSee! it rains! When pity comes too late the skies relent: There will be plenty soon for all, and peace, Except for me! Yet, since it is not fit Thou shouldst go street-stained to the merchant's house, With mire on thy fair feet‚Äîmyself will bear His concubine to Vittoo. Speak not! Dress!‚Äù And, when Night fell, and all the people slept Lulled by the bless√´d rain‚Äîsounded a knock At Vittoo's door‚Äîwaiting ajar: a voice Spake softly:‚ÄúKholo! open!‚ÄîI am here!‚Äù So,‚Äîlighted by the flickering lamp which burned At Ganpat's shrine‚Äîthe Sett beheld her stand‚Äî Beautiful Sita, Sita with dove's eyes, Sita whom all his soul loved and desired, Come to be his! Joyous he led the way To where an inner room shone bright with lights, And gay with painted walls, and richly set With luxury of yielding beds and shawls Woven with silk and silver. ‚ÄúSit, I pray; And suffer that I fetch thee foot-water, My goddess! who hast deigned to pace afoot Unto her worshipper!‚Äù Thus quoth the Sett Half glad, half fearful of his sighing guest, So silent, and so mournful, and so fair. But, when he would have laved those beauteous feet Look! not a journey-stain! not one small speck Upon them of bazaar-mud!‚Äîand such rain! ‚ÄúNow art thou surely Goddess!‚Äù Vittoo said: ‚ÄúAnd thou hast hither flown on hidden wings, Straight down from Swarga: else, how is there rain On thy smooth head, but no mire on thy feet?‚Äù Sita gave answer‚Äîvery sorrowful‚Äî ‚ÄúMy husband bore me hither‚Äîknowing all!‚Äù What think ye now that Sett did, hearing this? P. I cannot tell. He lived to call in debts! G. We cannot tell! Oh, Saheb of Sahebs, go on! S. He set the water-pot aside, and bowed His forehead to her feet‚Äîtouching his eyes, His brow, his mouth, his breast, with trembling hands; Making the eight prostrations. Then, he rose Clasping his palms together, while he paced Thrice round her, as ye circle Parvati Reverently worshipping; then meekly spake: ‚ÄúI am a sinful man, who dared to grasp At beauty all beyond me, as is Heaven; At goodness so above me as the stars Are higher than my roof; yet, dare I not Do wrong to him, who did himself this wrong, Bearing thee hither‚Äîout of noblest soul, Out of such truth that it makes false men true. Lady! go free of me! and pray thy Lord That he forgive! Say Vittoo writes thy debt ‚ÄòPaid‚Äô in his books‚Äîwith face upon the dust, And lips imploring pardon, as from Gods!‚Äù So came she spotless home; and the rain fell Through fifteen days; and rice sold cheap again. Now who did well herein, and who did ill? G. Oh, Shiva! the sweet tale!‚ÄîBy Chittor's curse I know it is a sin if holy saints Ask food and none be given; yet, were I he‚Äî Rather such sin,‚Äîwhatever Manu says‚Äî And Death, and Narak after! than to lose Were I that man‚Äîthe woman I so loved! P. I know it is a sin‚Äîas Manu saith‚Äî To loose the bond of marriage, and to sell Love for a gift; but yet‚Äîhad I been there‚Äî Rather than turn away that saint unfed‚Äî Were I the woman, and his strait so sore‚Äî I had done even as Sita, unabashed! S. See now, you stand on either side! and Right Splits midway, on the edge of Manu's rules. I think‚Äîinterpreting a Western mind‚Äî The wife did evil, helping life to live At cost of Love and Fame, dearer than Life: The husband evil, paying wrongful debt With coin which none should ask, and no man give: And most I praise Vittoo the grain-seller, Who sinned in heart, yet had such heart to see The loveliness of honour‚ÄîManu's sort! P. We must observe a promise! Azuf Jah Marching to war‚Äîonly a Mussulman!‚Äî Made compact with our Waghur cattle-men; Wrote it in gold, upon a copper plate, And kept its every line; even now they sing:‚Äî ‚ÄúDrink full of my rivers; Graze free in my fields; Strip grass from my roofs If no grass the soil yields: Three murders a day I forgive you:‚Äîbut, heed That your bullocks stand ready When Azuf hath need!‚Äù Now give me leave, good Sir! for I must say My sun-down Mantras in the bh√ªt-khana. I will return ere Gunga finds her tongue; That light mind flutters round your story still! [Exit Govind. G. Indeed, I mused, when the grey Pandit rose, Why I, too, feel‚Äîbeing but a dancing-girl‚Äî Vittoo was best! There must be happiness In that white world of Virtue, whence you brought The tender tale: but let hard thought alone! At Gwalior the Nautchnees killed a tree, Where Akbar's singer lay, for love of him, And of his tree‚Äîplucking the leaves away To make their voices beautiful‚Äîtill‚Äîlook! There was no tree! so may we pluck our lives Leafless with thinking. Shall we laugh again Till Govind comes? We did not finish OM, And you look weary:‚Äîlet me sing you this;‚Äî A young Bih√¢ri taught the words to me:‚Äî [Gunga plays and sings] Choti Gw√¢l√Æni‚ÄîA milkmaid sped Slender, and bright and brown; With a chatty of curds on her neat little head, To sell in Mathura town. ‚ÄúRama! ho, Rama! who buys of me Curds as white as the ivory?‚Äù Jahan dharel√™‚Äîwhen‚Äîat noon-tide, She set down the chatty, to rest, Tahan tamua‚Äîup to her side, In silver and satin dressed, Rama! ho Rama! canters the King; ‚ÄúSweet little milkmaid, marketing!‚Äù Agu! hokh agu!‚Äî‚Äúforwards go! Ride on your road, my Lord! If you lay hands on my sari so, The curds will spatter your sword! Rama! ho Rama! the curds will fall On silver, and satin, and jewels, and all!‚Äù ‚ÄúT√¥ra l√™kh√™‚Äîyou think it is curd That falls from your milk-pot, Dear! M√¥ra l√™kh√™‚ÄîI call it absurd A goddess such stuff should bear: Rama! ho Rama! 'tis amrit instead Which Heaven rains down on your beautiful head!‚Äù S. Thanks, Gunga! Ko√Øls fluting love in Spring Pipe nothing softer! but our Sage returns. [Govind re-enters. Now, Sir! we know that A, and U, and M, In this great Word, are three-fold states of life, Vai?v√¢nara the first‚Äîthe waking state; Next Taijasa, which is the sleep with dreams; And thirdly Prajna, where man slumbers deep Seeing no dreams, but floating, quit of flesh, On that still border-flood whose waters lave Life on one bank, and on the other Death. Now would we hear, ap ki mihrb√°ni se‚Äî Of your kind favour‚Äîhow the three combine. P. I read on from Mand√ªkya:‚ÄîThe Fourth Is that which holdeth all the three; being Life Past living, sleeping, dreaming, dying‚ÄîOM! He who is there is Brahman, knowing all‚Äî Not as we know, peeping inside and out‚Äî Not as we understand. ‚ÄòWise‚Äô or ‚Äòunwise‚Äô Are words without a meaning for the Soul Lifted so high! It seeth, all unseen; Perceiveth unperceived; not understood, It comprehendeth; never to be named, Never made palpable; not limited; The testimony of it being Itself, Itself made one with the One Soul, wherein Those states are each transcended and absorbed, Changeless, rejoicing, passionless, pervading! And this Eternal Soul of Life, the Self, Is named in naming OM; and OM is named From those three matras, A and U and M. A is Vai?v√¢nara, the Waking-State; And U is Taijasa, the State of Dreams; And M is Prajna, sleep deeper than dream, Where the soul wakes, and moves in larger light, Knowing a farther knowledge; growing one With HIM WHO IS! OM indivisible, Embracing those divisions,‚Äîhereby grasped‚Äî Is Soul, the Life of Life, the All, the True, Changeless, rejoicing, passionless. Say OM Solemnly, with stilled lips, and mouth made clean! He with his Soul entereth the Soul of Souls Who hath perceived these things‚Äîwho hath perceived! S. Pandit! I humbly thank you for my part In this most ancient lore, and mystical! I make namaskar with a grateful heart; Keep me in yours! Peace go with you! My horse Waits near the gate, bid them lead Wurdah round. [Exit Govind. And, Gunga! till he comes, wind up your strings And sing some last things now of love and tears. For if those Scripts are right our lives are wrong; Yours Chand ki tookri! yours, my ‚ÄòBeam of the Moon,‚Äô And mine, who toil to teach so foolishly, Being untaught. Yet what a goodly earth To seem all nought! What skies of vaulted gold Vainly to roof the lives so mocked and scorned! What furniture of beauty and delight Embellishes this world we are to hate At high command of old Philosophies! Samajhta? Sister!‚Äîdid you understand? These pearls which you do sweetly take of me, And the small hands that clutch them, and the eyes Which shine so bright, counting the pretty beads, Are false as fancy‚Äîvoid‚Äîthings that be not! Yet, how much surer than the surest joy Of Taijasa, or Prajna, seem your lips, Your black braids, plaited with the jasmine buds, Your quick brown fingers toying on the strings; And what neat feet to be illusions! Play! Find something sad but sweet; for Life is false, And Love is false, and only shadows live! And we must‚Äîlittle Gunga!‚Äîmelt to Gods, Who were so well-content, women and men; Must part, and pass, and dream: I know not‚ÄîOM! G. Jo hukhm, Maharaj! thy slave obeys: [Gunga sings and plays] ‚ÄúNay! if thou must depart, thou shalt depart; But why so soon‚Äîoh, Heart-blood of my heart? Go then! yet‚Äîgoing‚Äîturn and stay thy feet, That I may once more see that face so sweet: Once more‚Äîif never more; for swift days go As hastening waters from their fountains flow; And whether yet again shall meeting be Who knows? who knows? Ah! once more turn to me!‚Äù S. Who knows,‚Äîwho knows? Life a vain breeze that blows! [Gunga sings again] G. ‚ÄúBlow, gentle Breeze! from my Beloved's place; And let the airs touch mine, which touched her face: For this is much to the fond lover‚Äîthis Is food to live on‚Äîone wind-wafted kiss!‚Äù S. Oh, Bulbul of the hill, sing one verse more And then‚ÄîSalaam! G. And then Salaam! my Lord! [She lays aside her Vina, and sighing, sings] ‚ÄúNot seeing you, I pine to see! and, when I see, to know That you will go away again fills me with fear and woe; No joy of love I find in love, if you be near or far; Longing to have you by me, and dreading when you are! Life is not life, if we must live thinking of love's last day; Oh, never come, my Love and Life! or never go away!‚Äù OTHER POEMS. Laila. Oh, Foolish One! who wonderest if the eyes of lovers see The glory of the Living God in faces blank to thee; If unto them the form belov'd veils more than mortal charms, And Paradise stands open when ‚Äúmy Lady‚Äù spreads her arms. The Khal√Æf unto Laila said:‚ÄúArt thou that Maid of fame For whom a wanderer in the waste the lost Majn√ªn became? By Allah! not to me thou seem'st as fair as hath been told, No Rose of all our roses; no white pearl set in gold!

Under the marble's milk-white satin, With cherubim, seraphim, trumpets of Fame, And stately scrolls of imperial Latin Blazoning proudly each deathless name; I think I could rest in a well-pleased slumber; I think my flesh would be fain of the grave If I might be of this glorified number, And such a tomb, such epitaphs, have! He. Oh, easily lulled! and comforted lightly! If I might choose, I would have them give To the quick flames, burning clear and brightly, Whatever is left of me, after I live. Or else, in the kind great arms of the sea‚Äî Which nothing can cumber, and nothing stain‚Äî Lay it and leave it. So might I be Safe back with the winds and the waters again! She. At least confess 'twere a record splendid To lie, like Philips, with lovely verse Sounding the triumph of life well ended, Tenderly wreathing the minstrel's hearse; Was it not grand to wind such sweet riddance? ‚ÄúMaster! peaceful hereunder recline!‚Äù To be laid in earth with that gentle biddance? ‚ÄúTill Angels wake thee with songs like thine!‚Äù He. Fair is the verse; but, I think the Master Would rather live on a choral lip; Would liever some warm heart beat the faster For musical joy and fellowship, In anthems rolling‚Äîsolemn and certain‚Äî Or madrigals left us to play and to sing; Than have Angels set to draw Death's curtain, And lauds as loud as the praise of a King. She. Well! tell me then, was there ever graven A farewell softer to spirit fled Than Franklin hears in this quiet haven Where moor the fleets of our mighty Dead? Cenotaph? Yes!‚Äîbut the beautiful message! Where is one like it? ‚ÄúGreat Sailor-Soul! Sailing now on some happier passage, Voyaging hence to no earthly Pole!‚Äù He. Nay! I have seen what was like it, and better; Far away, on a Syrian hill: Not one word! not an Arabic letter Marked where the dead man lay so still; But round his headstone, for sorrow and story, A long black braid of tresses was tied! Think how she loved him to give the glory Of her hair! Would you, Dear! if I had died? Atalanta. Greek Atalanta! girdled high, Gold-sandalled; great majestic Maid!

Hadrian's Address to his Soul Soul of me! floating, and flitting, and fond! Thou and this body were life-mates together; Wilt thou be gone now? And whither? Pallid, and naked, and cold, Not to laugh, or be glad, as of old! The Depths of the Sea. (On a picture by Mr.Burne Jones, with the motto:‚Äîhabes quod tot√° mente petisti Infelix!) Which is the one we must pity, Master? Who is infelix‚Äîthe boy, or she Drawing him down from his barque's disaster To the pebbled floor of her silvery sea? With light keen laughter drawing him down; Gleeful to clasp him‚Äîher mariner brown‚Äî Heedless of life-breath, which bubbles upward, So the fair strong body her own may be. Who was the one that longed too madly To have the wish‚Äîand is sorry to have? Do you mean your sailor faced over-gladly The toils of the bitter and treacherous wave; The depths which charm, the danger which pleases, The death that tempts man's spirit, and teases; And now he has won it, his prize of daring, Dragged to the cold sea-maiden's cave? Or was it she, the Merman's Daughter,‚Äî Half soft white woman, half glittering scales‚Äî Who, sporting by starlight upon the water, Saw him, and passioned‚Äîand so prevails; Sent the gale, or the mountainous billow, To wash him down to the oozy pillow Where night and day, she will lull her lover, 'Mid whispering sea-shells, and green sea-dales? And she is to find‚Äîpoor Child of ocean, His mouth set fast, and his blue eyes dim; And lips, and limbs, and hands sans motion, And sweet love dumb in the breast of him; And her own wild heart will break to know Men cannot breathe in her Blue below, Nor mermaidens come to the Blue of his Heaven; Is that your moral, my Painter grim? Say, rather:‚Äúterque quaterque felices!‚Äù Fortunate, both of them, winning their will! If you paint the deep grey Sea's abysses Dare also to plunge to the depths of Ill! For Peace broods under the rough waves' riot, And beyond dark Death is delightful quiet; And once to have loved is good for the Sea-girl, And once to have died is better still! I call them happy‚Äîyea, ‚Äúthree and more times,‚Äù She hath her Boy; he hath his rest; And to finish love and life beforetimes For Sailor and Mermaid is‚Äîmay be‚Äîbest, I think she feels, by her subtle laughter, That to clasp him was good, whatever comes after; And what should a weary mariner wish for Better than sleep by Love caressed? The Heavenly Secret Sometimes,‚Äù sighed Lalage:‚Äúin hours of sadness, A sudden pleasure shines upon the soul, The heart beats quick to half-heard notes of gladness, And from the dark mind all its clouds unroll: How is this, Poet? You, who know things hidden, Whence sounds that under-song of soft content? What brings such peace, unlooked-for and unbidden? Say, now! Oh, is it truth or accident?‚Äù ‚ÄúDear Maid!‚Äù I said,‚Äúwisely you ask a poet, For there's my answer, on your upper lip! The Talmud writes: that dimple‚Äîas you show it‚Äî Between the rosy mouth and nose's tip, Was stamped by God's own hand, the day He made us, When unto each He whispered All goeth well!‚Äù But pressed His finger on our lips, and laid us Under His secret not to know‚Äînor tell! An Adieu. India farewell! I shall not see again Thy shining shores, thy peoples of the Sun, Gentle, soft-mannered, by a kind word won To such quick kindness! O'er the Arab main Our flying flag streams back; and backwards stream My thoughts to those fair open fields I love, City and village, maidan, jungle, grove, The temples and the rivers! Must it seem Too great for one man's heart to say it holds So many many Indian sisters dear, So many Indian brothers? that it folds Lakhs of true friends in parting? Nay! but there Lingers my heart, leave-taking; and it roves From hut to hut whispering ‚Äúhe knows, and loves!‚Äù Good-bye! Good-night! Sweet may your slumbers be, Gunga! and Ka?i! and Sar√¢swati! March 5, 1886, S.S. Siam. The Indian Judge A cloud was on the Judge's brow The day we walked in Aitwar-P√™t; I knew not then, but since I know What held his earnest features set: That great cause in the Suddur Court! To-morrow judgment should be given; And, in my old friend's troubled thought Conscience with prejudice had striven. Nay, nay! No juster Judge on bench! But Justice in this cause of ‚ÄúWheatstone's,‚Äù Was hard to do. I could not wrench His sombre eyes from Poona's street-stones. Silent we threaded M√¥ti-chouk, Paced silent past the Dharma-s√¢la; At last, half petulant, I spoke; ‚ÄúHere is our Sanskrit School‚ÄîPat-sh√¢la!‚Äù ‚ÄúSee! listening to their grey Guru The Brahman boys read Hindu cases; Justinian and the Code for you, Manu for them! What solemn faces ‚ÄúRange, in dark ring, around the book Wherefrom the old Ach√¢rya preaches!‚Äù He paused, and, with a wistful look, Said:‚ÄúMight one know what Manu teaches? So drew we nigh the School, and paid Due salutations; while the Master‚Äî Proud to be marked by Sahebs‚Äîmade The strong shlokes roll, fuller and faster: ‚ÄúNa vismay√™ta tapas√¢ Vad√™dishtwa cha nanritan Na parik√¨rttay √™t datw√¢ Nartti' pyapavad√™d vipran.‚Äù ‚ÄúNamutra hi sah√¢yartham Pita mata cha tishtatas Na jnatir na putrad√¢ram Tishtati dharma k√™valas‚Äù All down to kasar√Ærinam Gravely the Shastri chants the verses, Rocking his head; while, after him, The turbaned class each line rehearses. ‚ÄúWhat is the lesson?‚Äù asked my friend, With low salaam, reply was given: ‚ÄúManu's Fourth Chapter‚Äînear the end‚Äî At shloke two hundred thirty-seven.‚Äù Then, turning to the brightest-eyed Of those brown pupils round him seated, ‚ÄúGunput,‚Äù the Shastri said, with pride, ‚ÄúIf it shall please my Lords, can read it.‚Äù We nodded; and the Brahman lad‚Äî At such great charge shy, but delighted‚Äî In what soft English speech he had The Devan√¢giri recited: ‚ÄúBe not too proud of good deeds wrought!‚Äî When thou art come from prayer, speak truly!‚Äî Even if he wrongeth thee in aught Respect thy Guru! Give alms duly; ‚ÄúBut let none wist! Live, day by day, With little and with little swelling Thy tale of duty done‚Äîthe way The wise ant-people build their dwelling; ‚ÄúNot harming any living thing: That thou may'st have‚Äîat time of dying,‚Äî A Hand to hold thee, and to bring Thy footsteps safe; and, so relying, ‚ÄúPass to the farther world. For none Save Justice leads there! Father, mother, Will not be nigh; nor wife, nor son, Nor friends, nor kin; nor any other ‚ÄúSave only Justice! All alone Each entereth here, and each one leaveth This life alone; and every one The fruit of all his deeds receiveth ‚ÄúAlone‚Äîalone; bad deeds and good! That day when kinsmen, sadly turning, Forsake thee, like the clay or wood, A thing committed to the burning. ‚ÄúBut Justice shall not quit thee then, If thou hast served her; therefore never Cease serving; that she hold thee, when The darkness falls which falls forever, ‚ÄúWhich hath no star, nor way to guide. But Justice knows the road; the midnight Is noon to her. Man at her side Goes through the gloom safe to the hid light. ‚ÄúAnd he who loved her more than all, Who purged by sorrow his offences, Shall shine in realms celestial With glory, quit of sins and senses.‚Äù What made my friend so softly lay His hand on Gunput's naked shoulder With gentle words of praise, and say,‚Äî His eyes grown happier and bolder,‚Äî ‚ÄúI too have been at school! Accept Thanks, Guru! for these words imparted‚Äù? And when we turned away he kept Silence no more, but smiled, light-hearted. And, next day, in his Indian Court, That summing-up he did declaim us‚Äî Straight in the teeth of what was thought‚Äî Which made ‚ÄúHis Honour‚Äù feared and famous. Jeanne. (From Victor Hugo.) Jeanne, in the dark room, had dry bread for dinner, Guilty of something wrong; and I‚Äîthe sinner‚Äî Crept up to see that prisoner in her cell, And slipped‚Äîon the sly‚Äîsome comfits to her. Well! Against the laws, I own! Those, who with me Support the order of society, Were furious! Vainly murmured little Jeanne, ‚ÄúIndeed, indeed, I never will again Rub my nose with my thumb! I won't make pussy Scratch me!‚Äù they only cried, ‚ÄúThe naughty hussy! She knows how weak you are, and wanting sense, And sees you only laugh at grave offence: Government is not possible! All day Order is troubled, influence slips away, No rules, no regulations! nought can mend her; You ruin everything!‚Äù Then I‚Äîthe offender‚Äî I hang my head, and say, ‚ÄúThere's no excuse! I know I err; I know by such abuse, Such wrong indulgence, nations ‚Äògo to pot;‚Äô Put me upon dry bread!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy should we not? We will! you merit it!‚Äù But my small maid From her dark corner looking unafraid With eyes divine to see, full of a sense Of settled justice, in their innocence, Whispered, for me to hear, ‚ÄúWell, if they do, I shall bring comfits, Grandpapa, to you.‚Äù A Rajp√ªt Nurse. ‚ÄúWhose tomb have they builded, Vittoo! under this tamarind tree, With its door of the rose-veined marble, and white dome stately to see, Was he holy Brahman, or Yogi, or Chief of the Rajp√ªt line, Whose urn rests here by the river, in the shade of the beautiful shrine?‚Äù ‚ÄúMay it please you,‚Äù quoth Vittoo, salaaming, ‚ÄúProtector of all the poor! It was not for holy Brahman they carved that delicate door; Nor for Yogi, nor Rajp√ªt Rana, built they this gem of our land; But to tell of a Rajp√ªt woman, as long as the stones should stand. ‚ÄúHer name was M√¥ti, the pearl-name; 'twas far in the ancient times; But her moon-like face and her teeth of pearl are sung of still in our rhymes; And because she was young, and comely, and of good repute, and had laid A babe in the arms of her husband, A Hindu father acknowledges paternity by receiving in his arms his new-born child. the Palace-Nurse she was made: ‚ÄúFor the sweet chief-queen of the Rana in Joudhpore city had died, Leaving a motherless infant, the heir to that race of pride; The heir of the peacock-banner, of the five-coloured flag, of the throne Which traces its record of glory from days when it ruled alone; ‚ÄúFrom times when, forth from the sunlight, The Rajp√ªt dynasty is said to be descended from the sun. the first of our kings came down And had the earth for his footstool, and wore the stars for his crown, As all good Rajp√ªts have told us; so M√¥ti was proud and true, With the Prince of the land on her bosom, and her own brown baby too. ‚ÄúAnd the Rajp√ªt women will have it (I know not myself of these things) As the two babes lay on her lap there, her lord's, and the Joudhpore King's; So loyal was the blood of her body, so fast the faith of her heart, It passed to her new-born infant, who took of her trust its part. ‚ÄúHe would not suck of the breast-milk till the Prince had drunken his fill; He would not sleep to the cradle-song till the Prince was lulled and still; And he lay at night with his small arms clasped round the Rana's child, As if those hands like the rose-leaf could shelter from treason wild. ‚ÄúFor treason was wild in the country, and villainous men had sought The life of the heir of the gadi, The ‚Äúseat‚Äù or throne. to the Palace in secret brought; With bribes to the base, and with knife-thrusts for the faithful, they made their way Through the line of the guards, and the gateways, to the hall where the women lay. ‚ÄúThere M√¥ti, the foster-mother, sate singing the children to rest Her baby at play on her crossed knees, and the King's son held to her breast; And the dark slave-maidens round her beat low on the cymbal's skin Keeping the time of her soft song‚Äîwhen‚ÄîSaheb!‚Äî there hurried in ‚ÄúA breathless watcher, who whispered, with horror in eyes and face: ‚ÄòOh! M√¥ti! men come to murder my Lord the Prince in this place! They have bought the help of the gate-guards, or slaughtered them unawares, Hark! that is the noise of their tulwars, Indian swords. the clatter upon the stairs!‚Äù ‚ÄúFor one breath she caught her baby from her lap to her heart, and let The King's child sink from her nipple, with lips still clinging and wet, Then tore from the Prince his head-cloth, and the putta of pearls from his waist, And bound the belt on her infant, and the cap on his brows, in haste; ‚ÄúAnd laid her own dear offspring, her flesh and blood, on the floor, With the girdle of pearls around him, and the cap that the King's son wore; While close to her heart, which was breaking, she folded the R√¢ja's joy, And‚Äîeven as the murderers lifted the purdah‚Äîshe fled with his boy. ‚ÄúBut there (so they deemed) in his jewels, lay the Chota Rana, ‚ÄúLittle King.‚Äù the Heir; ‚ÄòThe cow with two calves has escaped us,‚Äô cried one, ‚Äòit is right and fair She should save her own butcha; ‚ÄúLittle one.‚Äù no matter! the edge of the dagger ends This spark of Lord Raghoba's sunlight; stab thrice and four times, O friends!‚Äô ‚ÄúAnd the Rajp√ªt women will have it (I know not if this can be so) That M√¥ti's son in the putta and golden cap cooed low, When the sharp blades met in his small heart, with never one moan or wince, But died with a babe's light laughter, because he died for his Prince. ‚ÄúThereby did that Rajp√ªt mother preserve the line of our Kings.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh! Vittoo,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut they gave her much gold and beautiful things, And garments, and land for her people, and a home in the Palace! May be She had grown to love that Princeling even more than the child on her knee.‚Äù ‚ÄúMay it please the Presence!‚Äù quoth Vittoo,‚Äúit seemeth not so! they gave The gold and the garments and jewels, as much as the proudest would have; But the same night deep in her true heart she buried a knife, and smiled, Saying this:‚ÄòI have saved my Rana! I must go to suckle my child!‚Äô‚Äù‚Äù Zanouba's Song. From the Persian: [Heard at a Nautch, in Bhaonagar Palace, Nov. 1885]. ‚ÄúO face of the tulip, and bosom Of the jasmine, whose Cypress are you? Whose fate are you, cold-hearted Blossom?‚Äî In the Garden of Grace, where you grew, The lily boasts no more her fragrance, And the rose hangs her head at your feet; Ah! whose is that mouth like the rose-bud, Making honey seem no longer sweet? ‚ÄúYou pass, taking hearts; you ensnare one Like wine; and your eyes dart a light As of arrows. Whose are you, most fair one! With brow like the crescent of night? Have you come to make me, too, your victim? So be it! Ah, loveliest lip, Give now to this slave who adores you One drop from that death-cup to sip.‚Äù The Snake and the Baby. ‚ÄúIn sin conceived,‚Äù you tell us,‚Äúcondemned for the guilt of birth,‚Äù From the moment when, lads and lasses, they come to this beautiful Earth; And the rose-leaf hands, and the limpid eyes, and the blossom-mouths, learning to kiss Mean nothing, my good Lord Bishop! which, any way, shakes you in this? Well, I‚ÄîI believe in babies! from the dawn of a day in spring When, under the neems, in my garden, I saw a notable thing, Long ago, in my Indian garden. 'Twas a morning of gold and grey, And the Sun‚Äîas you never see him‚Äîhad melted the last stars away. My Arab, before the house-door, stood stamping the gravel to go, All wild for our early gallop; and you heard the caw of the crow, And the ‚Äúnine little sisters‚Äù a-twitter in the thorn-bush; and, farther away The coppersmith's stroke in the fig-tree, awaking the squirrels to play. My foot was raised to the stirrup, and the bridle gathered. What made Syce Gopal stare straight before him, with visage fixed and dismayed? What made him whisper in terror? ‚ÄúO Shiva, the snake! the snake!‚Äù I looked where Gopal was gazing, and felt my own heart quake! For there‚Äîin a patch of sunlight‚Äîwhere the path to the well went down, The year-old baby of Gopal, sate naked, and soft, and brown, His small right hand encircling a lota of brass, his left Close-cuddling a great black cobra, slow-creeping forth from a cleft! We held our breaths! The serpent drew clear its lingering tail As we gazed; you could see its dark folds and silvery belly trail Tinkling the baby's bangles, and climbing his thigh and his breast, As it glided beneath the fingers on those cold scales fearlessly pressed. He was crowing‚Äîthat dauntless baby!‚Äîwhile the lank black Terror squeezed, Its muzzle and throat 'twixt the small flank and arm of the boy! Well pleased, He was hard at play with his serpent, pretending to guard the milk, And stroking that grewsome comrade with palms of nut brown silk! Alone, untended, and helpless, he was cooing low to the snake; Which coiled and clung about him, even more (as it seemed) for the sake Of the touch of his velvety body, and the love of his laughing eyes, And the flowery clasp of his fingers, than to make the milk a prize. For, up to the boy's face mounting, we saw the cobra dip His wicked head in the lota, and drink with him, sip for sip; Whereat, with a chuckle, that baby pushed off the serpent's head, And‚Äîlook!‚Äîthe red jaws opened, and the terrible hood was spread! And Gopal muttered beside me ‚ÄúSaheb, maro! maro!‚Äù ‚ÄúStrike, sir! strike!‚Äù to see The forked tongue glance at the infant's neck, and the spectacled devilry Of the flat crest dancing and darting all round that innocent brow; Yet it struck not; but, quietly closing its jaws and its hood, laid now The horrible mottled murder of its mouth in the tender chink Of the baby's plump crossed thighlets; while peacefully he did drink What breakfast-milk he wanted, then held the lota down For the snake to finish at leisure, plunged deep in it, fang and crown. Three times, before they parted, my Syce would have sprung to the place, In fury to smite the serpent; but I held him fast, for one pace Had been death to the boy! I knew it! and I whispered, ‚ÄúGopal, wait! ‚ÄúChooprao! Be quiet!‚Äù he is wiser than we are; he has never yet learned to hate!‚Äù Then coil by coil, the cobra unwound its glistering bands, Sliding‚Äîall harmless and friendly‚Äîfrom under the baby's hands; Who crowed, as his comrade left him, in year-old language to say ‚ÄúGood-bye! for this morning, Serpent! come very soon back to play!‚Äù So, I thought, as I mounted ‚ÄúWurdah,‚Äù and galloped the Maidan thrice, ‚ÄúMillennium's due to-morrow, by ‚Äòbaby and cockatrice‚Äô!‚Äù And I never can now believe it, my Lord! that we come to this Earth Ready-damned, with the seeds of evil sown quite so thick at our birth! From a Sikh Hymn. ‚ÄúThe beautiful blue of the Sky is the Guru of Man; And his Father the Water white; And his Mother the broad-browed Earth, with her bountiful span; And the sweet-bosomed Night Is the black Nurse who lulls him to sleep, with the stars in her ears; And the strong striding-Day Is the Hamal, with glittering turban and putta, who bears The children to play.‚Äù A Farewell. (From the French.) To four-score years my years have come; At such an age to shuffle home Full time it seems to be: So now, without regret, I go, Gaily my packing-up I do; Bonsoir, la Compagnie! When no more in this world I dwell Where I shall live I can't quite tell; Dear God! be that with Thee! Thou wilt ordain nothing save right, Why should I feel then grief or fright? Bonsoir, la Compagnie! Of pleasant days I had my share; For love and fame no more I care; Good sooth, they weary me! A gentleman, when fit for nought, Takes leave politely, as he ought: Bonsoir, la Compagnie! A Love-Song of Henri Quatre. Come, rosy Day! Come quick‚ÄîI pray‚Äî I am so glad when I thee see! Because my Fair, Who is so dear, Is rosy-red and white like thee. She lives, I think On heavenly drink Dawn-dew, which Hebe pours for her; Else‚Äîwhen I sip At her soft lip How smells it of ambrosia? She is so fair None can compare; And, oh, her slender waist divine! Her sparkling eyes Set in the skies The morning star would far outshine! Only to hear Her voice so clear The village gathers in the street; And Tityrus, Grown one of us, Leaves piping on his flute so sweet. The Graces three, Where'er she be, Call all the Loves to flutter nigh; And what she'll say,‚Äî Speak when she may,‚Äî Is full of sense and majesty! From the Sanskrit Anthology. Ah, God! I have not had Thee day and night In thought, nor magnified Thy name aright, Nor lauded Thee, nor glorified, nor laid Upon thine altars one poor ku?a-blade! Yet now, when I seek refuge, Lord! with Thee I ask, and Thou wilt give all good to me! I am of sinfulness and sorrows full! Thou art the Mighty, Great, and Merciful! How should we not be friends, or Thou not save Me who bring nought to Thee Who all things gave? Basti Singh's Wife (A Bihari Mill Song.) 1. Basti Singh's wife, shredding betel‚Äîbetel-leaf, and cloves, and spices‚Äî Mixed a savoury mess, and made it rich and fragrant; ‚ÄîHuriji! Husking paddy, husking s√¢thi, ‚ÄúSixty-day rice.‚Äù boiled and strained the steaming rices, Poured the dall and conjee on it: so, 'tis ready!‚ÄîHuriji! 2. ‚ÄúMother-in-law! beside me sitting, is it fitting A Hindoo wife may converse unveiled and freely with the younger brothers of her husband, but not with the elder brothers. if I carry To my husband's elder brother food to eat now?‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! ‚ÄúDaughter-in-law! fold close thy sari over face and neck, nor tarry; Bare thy hands alone in serving Basti's brother.‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 3. Sitting down to eat, he marked her, Basti's brother marked her beauty, Evil eyes from feet to forehead wandering, pondering.‚ÄîHuriji! ‚ÄúElder brother of my husband! I have surely failed of duty; Too much salt unto the conjee have I added?‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 4. ‚ÄúToo much salt thou hast not added, fair wife of my younger brother! Nor in aught hast failed of duty, thou with dove's eyes!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! At the dawn they beat the big drums‚Äî‚ÄúHo! let all the people gather, Small and great, to see the hunting of the sleek deer‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 5. Deer they killed, and hares, and peacocks, shooting hard with arrows sharpened, Basti's brother pierced his brother with an arrow;‚ÄîHuriji! ‚ÄúMother-in-law, beside me seated, what calamity hath happened?‚Äù See! the spangle The tikuli, a spot of red, white, or yellow paint placed on the forehead. It is a very bad omen to have it come off. on my forehead to the earth falls!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 6. ‚ÄúDaughter-in-law! say no such evil! speak no word of ill-betiding! Basti Singh has gone a-hunting; have thou patience!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! Hark! the tramping, and the champing! all the riders homewards riding! Only Basti's horse returning riderless, ah!‚ÄîHuriji! 7. Look! the bright swords in each scabbard! Look! the arrows in each quiver! Only Basti's sword and quiver soaked with black blood!‚ÄîHuriji! At the first watch, comes in darkness to her hut-door by the river Basti's elder brother knocking, softly knocking:‚ÄîHuriji! 8. ‚ÄúIf you be a jackal prowling, if you be a dog at pillage, If you be the village people, get you hence now!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! ‚ÄúNay, no dog or jackal am I; nor the people of the village; I am Basti Singh the Rajpoot; fair wife open!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 9. ‚ÄúLiar! that is not my Lord's voice! Thou hast slain him! Quick! confess it! Where, thou liar? how, thou liar? by what tree, now?‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! ‚ÄúYes! I slew him in the jungle‚Äîfor thy sweet love, I profess it! Underneath a twisted sandal lies his body!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 10. ‚ÄúShow me!‚Äù ‚ÄúNay!‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut only, Basti's widow! if thou swearest Thou wilt keep his bed-place for me at thy soft side‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! ‚ÄúOh, my husband's elder brother! if his death-place thou declarest, This I swear, none else shall have it‚Äîshow me! show me!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 11. All beneath the eyes of midnight, under peepul trees which listen, Over plain, and down the nullah, through the river,‚ÄîHuriji! On the road with horse-hoofs dinted, by the paths where blood-drops glisten, To the twisted tree he led her:‚ÄúLook! thy Husband!‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! 12. ‚ÄúOh, my Husband's elder brother! oh, thou Slayer! oh, thou Liar! Fetch me flame, the while I build the pile for burning:‚Äù‚ÄîHuriji! ‚ÄúSwear, once more, none else shall have you, if I go to fetch you fire.‚Äù ‚ÄúYea! I swear!‚Äù said Basti's widow, building, building‚ÄîHuriji! 13. Hasten! hasten! Basti's brother! She hath laid him, bold and lonely, On the dry wood! She hath mounted! From her breast-cloth,‚ÄîHuriji! She hath drawn hid fire and set it. Haste not! there are ashes only Left of Basti Singh the Rajpoot, and his true wife‚ÄîHuriji! But all the tears of all the eyes Find room in Gunga's bed: And all the sorrow is gone to-morrow When the scarlet flames have fed. In Memory of S. S., √Ütat. 21. (Who was accidentally drowned in Loch Maree, Scotland, on the 29th of August, 1887.) Too dear to die! too sweet to live, and bear The griefs which burden all our being here! Too precious to give up, could Love but stay The stroke of Fate, and parting pangs delay! Yet take her‚Äîsince 'tis willed‚ÄîAngels of Heav'n! Your Sister-Angel; her so briefly given To grace and gladden Earth. Ah, wild Scotch Lake! We will not curse thee, for her gentle sake; Ah! cruel Water-Nymphs! who drew her in, We half forgive, she was so fair to win! Ah, Rocks and Rowan-trees, who saw her die, And could not save her! we shall, by and by, Know the hard secret of a woe like this, And see‚Äîclear-eyed‚Äîhow Sorrow brings to Bliss. To-day there comes no comfort! None! We wave Weak hands towards that gloom beyond the grave; We speed vain messages of tender thought To that new-vanished Spirit; who saith naught! Still, she must know! must hear! must yearn to say All's well with her; that Love and Death, alway, Are friends; and last pains light, and swift to heal; And the Loch's winding-sheet not cold to feel! She speaks! with higher life made glad and full; Our ears for Angels' whispers are too dull! Have, then, thy early peace, Sophie! and we‚Äî By this trust lightened‚ÄîLove's blind agony. Epitaph written for the Same Dear Maid! the waters, closing o'er thy head, Snatched thee from Earth, but opened Heaven, instead. Sadly we give thee back to God That gave, In this faith firm‚Äîthat He, who walked the wave, Held thy Soul up, when thy sweet Body sank; And led thee, loving, to the Blissful Bank. Pray for us, new-made Angel!‚Äînow, that we Sink not beneath the waves of Sorrow's Sea.</field>
