      <field name="fulltext">? Sing, Maiden Muse, Sixpence, Hoop-petticoat, and Church on Fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Splendid Shilling, by Mr. John Phillips. ? Sing, heav'nly Muse, Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime, A Shilling, Breeches, and Chimera's dire. Happy the Man, who void of Care and Strife, In silken or in leathern Purse retains A Splendid Shilling: He nor hears with Pain New Oysters cry'd, nor sighs for chearful Ale; But with his Friends, when mighty Mists arise, To Juniper's, Magpye, or Town Hall repairs: Where mindful of the Nymph, whose wanton Eye Transfix'd his Soul, and kindled amorous Flames, Chloe or Phillis; he each circling Glass Wisheth her Health, and Joy, and equal Love. Mean while, he smoaks and laughs at merry Tale, Or Pun ambiguous, or Conundrum quaint. But I, whom griping Penury surrounds, And Hunger, sure Attendant upon Want, With scanty Offals, and small acid Tiff (Wretched Repast!) my meagre Corps sustain: Then solitary walk, or doze at home In Garret vile, and with a warming Puff Regale chill'd Fingers; or from Tube as black As Winter Chimney, or well-polish'd Jet, Exhale Mundungus, ill-perfuming Scent: Not blacker Tube, nor of a shorter Size Smoaks Cambro-Britain (vers'd in Pedigree, Sprung from Cadwalader and Arthur, Kings Full famous in romantick Tale) when he O'er many a craggy Hill and barren Cliff, Upon a Cargo of fam'd Cestrian Cheese, High over-shadowing rides, with a design To vend his Wares, or at the Arvonian Mart, Or Ma[illeg.]idunum, or the ancient Town Ecleap'd Brechinia, or where Vaga's Stream Encircles Ariconium, fruitful Soil, Whence flow nectareous Wines, that well may vie With Massic, Setin, or renown'd Falern. Thus, while my joyless Minutes tedious flow, With Looks demure, and silent Pace, a Dunn, Horrible Monster! hated by Gods and Men, To my aerial Citadel ascends; With vocal Heel thrice thund'ring at my Gates, With hideous Accent thrice he calls; I know The Voice ill-boding, and the solemn Sound. What shou'd I do? or whither turn? Amaz'd, Confounded, to the dark Recess I fly Of Woodhole; strait my bristling Hairs erect Thro' sudden Fear; a chilly Sweat bedews My shudd'ring Limbs, and (wonderful to tell!) My Tongue forgets her Faculty of Speech; So horrible he seems! his faded Brows Entrench'd with many a Frown, and conic Beard And spreading Band, admir'd by modern Saints, Disastrous Acts forebode; in his Right Hand Long Scrolls of Paper solemnly he waves, With Characters and Figures dire inscrib'd, Grievous to mortal Eyes; (ye Gods, avert Such Plagues from righteous Men!) behind him stalks Another Monster, not unlike himself, Sullen of Aspect, by the Vulgar call'd A Catchpole, whose polluted Hands the Gods With Force incredible, and Magick Charms Erst have endu'd: if he is ample Palm Should haply on ill-fated Shoulder lay Of Debtor, strait his Body, to the Touch Obsequious (as whilom Knights were wont) To some enchanted Castle is convey'd, Where Gates impregnable, and coercive Chains In Durance strict detain him, till in form Of Money, Pallas sets the Captive free. Beware, ye Debtors, when ye walk beware, Be circumspect; oft with insidious Ken This Caitif eyes your Steps aloof, and oft Lies perdue in a Nook or gloomy Cave, Prompt to enchant some inadvertent Wretch With his unhallow'd Touch. So (Poets sing) Grimalkin to Domestick Vermin sworn An everlasting Foe, with watchful Eye Lies nightly brooding o'er a chinky Gap, Protending her fell Claws, to thoughtless Mice Sure Ruin. So her disembowel'd Web Arachne in a Hall, or Kitchen spreads, Obvious to vagrant Flies: She secret stands Within her woven Cell; the humming Prey, Regardless of their Fate, rush on the Toils Inextricable, nor will aught avail Their Arts, nor Arms, nor Shapes of lovely hue; The Wasp insidious, and the buzzing Drone, And Butterfly proud of expanded Wings Distinct with Gold, entangled in her Snares, Useless Resistance make: With eager Strides, She tow'ring flies to her expected Spoils; Then with envenom'd Jaws the vital Blood Drinks of reluctant Foes, and to her Cave Their bulky Carcasses triumphant drags. So pass my Days. But when Nocturnal Shades This World invelop, and th'inclement Air Persuades Men to repel benumming Frosts With pleasant Wines, and crackling Blaze of Wood; Me lonely sitting, nor the glimmering Light Of Make-weight Candle, nor the joyous Talk Of loving Friend delights; distress'd, forlorn, Amidst the Horrors of the tedious Night, Darkling I sigh, and feed with dismal Thoughts My anxious Mind; or sometimes mournful Verse Indite, and sing of Groves and Myrtle Shades, Or desperate Lady near a purling Stream, Or Lover pendent on a Willow-Tree: Mean while, I labour with eternal Drought, And restless wish and [illeg.] my [illeg.] Finds no Relief, nor heavy Eyes Repose: But if a Slumber haply does invade My weary Limbs, my Fancy's still awake, Thoughtful of Drink, and eager, in a Dream, Tipples imaginary Pots of Ale: In vain; awake I find the settled Thirst Still gnawing, and the pleasant Phantom curse. Thus do I live from Pleasure quite debarr'd, Nor taste the Fruits that the Sun's genial Rays Mature, John-Apple, nor the downy Peach, Nor Walnut in rough-furrow'd Coat secure, Nor Medlar, Fruit delicious in Decay: Afflictions great! yet greater still remain: My Galligaskins that have long withstood The Winter's Fury, and encroaching Frosts, By Time subdued (what will not Time subdue!) An horrid Chasm disclose, with Orifice Wide, discontinous; at which the Winds Eurus and Auster, and the dreadful Force Of Boreas, that congeals the Cronian Waves, Tumultuous enter with dire chilling Blasts, Portending Agues. Thus a well-fraught Ship Long sail'd secure, or thro' the Ægean Deep, Or the Ionian, till cruising near The Lilybean Shoar, with hideous Crush On Scylla, or Charybdis (dang'rous Rocks) She strikes rebounding, whence the shatter'd Oak, So firce a Shock unable to withstand, Admits the Sea; in at the gaping Side The crowding Waves gush with impetuous Rage, Resistless, Overwhelming; Horrors seize The Mariners, Death in their Eyes appears, They stare, they lave, they pump, they swear, they pray; (Vain Efforts!) still the battering Waves rush in Implacable, till delug'd by the Foam, The Ship sinks found'ring in the vast Abyss. THE CROOKED SIX-PENCE By Mrs. KATHARINE PHILLIPS. ? Sing, Maiden Muse, Six-pence, Hoop-petticoat, and Church on fire. Happy the Maid, who from green Sickness free, In Canvass or in Holland Pocket bears A crooked Six-pence. She envieth not New-married Folks, nor sighs at others Banns. At Eve, when Sol this Hemisphere forsakes, She to her Needle or her Wheel repairs. Then, not unmindful of the Man, dear Man, Whose Faith by Promises and am'rous Oaths, And crooked Sixpence, was to her betroth'd, William or Thomas, at her Work she cry's, His Year next March is up, and so is mine. Meanwhile he Shoes japans, or buckling Wigs, Sings Durfey's Songs by Purcellini set. But I, who in my Head bear Pain, and draw Short Breath, Attendant sure on Sickness green, With Cinders, or with Morter from the Wall, Wretched Repast! my fading Flesh distain! In Chimney-corner close I poking sit, Nor ever stir spontaneous, scarce when call'd. I loll, I stretch, I yawn, and from a Tub (Like that whence Burgess preach'd) Oatmeal purloin, Oatmeal, unsalutary Food if raw! More wholsome than ycleap'd Burgoût, which feeds North British Lad, full famous in Records Of England's Chronicle for selling Kings, When he o'er hoary Hills, or craggy Cliffs, Or rugged Rocks, where Eagles build their Nest, Rides on a Galloway tho' small, yet strong. Voy'ging from Dungbay Head through Sheriffdoms Barren and bleak, with chequer'd Plad superb, Intent with clipp'd Jacobusses to buy French Wine in Lusitanian Casks ypent, Which well-paid Perjurers vouch all for Port, Though they perhaps the Growth of Bourdeaux be, Chatteau, Margout, or the renown'd Pontack. Thus while in Qualms my heavy Moments creep, A Wight in Habit Velvet all and Gold, Formal and fine, dread Monster! Doctor hight, With solemn Face into the Kitchen stalks. His bony Fingers thrice my Pulse assay; Thrice Secrets deep he asks; surpris'd I dread The Voice obscene, and hate the sickly Sound. What shall I do? amaz'd, confounded, dumb I stand, nor Answer give to his Demands, Nauseous to Virgin Ears; my frizzled Hair Stands upright, to its Roof my Tongue sticks dry, Retentive Faculty my Bowels lose, So horrible he seems.—His Horse-hair Wig Stiffen'd with angry Curls, his Agate Cane And gilded Sword (too oft by Cowards worn) Disastrous Deeds forebode; in his Right-hand The desp'rate Pen he takes, which ting'd with Ink, Strange Characters and Figures dire inscribes, Illegible to Maid, or Man, or Witch. Oh, may such Plagues averted ever be From modest Spinsters. Lo! behind him sneaks Another Mortal, not unlike himself, Of Jargon full, with Terms obscure o'ercharg'd, Apothecary call'd, whose fœtid Hands With Power mechanic, and with Charms arcane, Apollo God of Med'cine has endu'd. If he gilt Pills, Powder, or Bolus brown, Haply into the open Mouth convey Of Patient, streight his Body to the Dose Obsequious (as erst La Mancha's Knight) Is to a Feather-bed well warm'd convey'd. Sheets never to be chang'd, and watchful Nurse The captive Wretch incarcerate, till Time, The best Physician, set the Patient free. Beware, ye Virgins, of your Health beware; Be circumspect to romp or run, ascend The Mountain's airy Top; th'Empirick Crew Will else oft visit your Abode, by Fees Of Gold allur'd, and dang'rous Symptoms find. Prompt to torment some pale unthriving Wench, With griping Buck-thorn, or with Launcet sharp To pierce the shiv'ring Arm. So Poets sing, Sow-gelder erst to Calves, Pigs, Colts, and Lambs, Sworn everlasting Foe, with goggling Eyes To Stables, Sties, or Cow-pens early comes, Protending his fell Knife to thoughtless Bulls Sure Ruin. So in undiscerning Night, Myriads of Fairies by their Monarch led To Infants Cradles, or to Nursery-Rooms In serried Files march on. Meanwhile the Babe Secure in Innocence sleeps sound and smiles. The Peers and Peeresses with Ob'ron's self, Great Oberon, of Fairy Realms supreme, Within one Circle all, in Dance and Song, And Midnight Music move their tiny Feet. Nurse hears, or thinks she hears, 'twixt sleep and wake, Loud Sounds, unseen, delightful to the Ear: But Fairy Fiddles lull again to Sleep. Eftsoons King Oberon and twelve chosen Men, With scaling Ladders of Dutch Thread compact, The Cradle mount, collecting all their Might, The Burthen of the pond'rous Child they raise. Inexorable, nor will aught avail Bright Eyes, loud Tears, or Limbs proportion'd well, For Pygmy Brat they change the bouncing Boy, And to their own Abodes, where'er they be, The harmless Babe with Io Pæans drag. So pass my Days, but when a Wake or Fair Comes on, and calls the joyous Damsels forth; When Swains in Leathern Galligaskins clad, Treat Nymphs with Cyder, sparkling Drink and sweet; In melancholy Hall or Kitchen wide, I cough deserted; Partner for the Dance None chuses me, none on the Beachen Bark My Name inscribes, no brawny Batchelor Hangs over me enamour'd. Singly sad My Woe, through three times six revolving Years I count, no jolly Jo, nor sober Sam The matrimonial Question e'er propos'd, Or crooked Six-pence offer'd to divide. Amidst the Horrors of long Wint'ry Nights I sigh, my Heart into my white-rann'd Shoes With Palpitation sinks. I ponder now Where Rats-bane's sold, and now again the Well I view irresolute, and oft the Strength Of my own Garters try. Peevish I pine, And fret, and rave, and wish; my roving Mind Finds no Relief, my rolling Eyes no Sleep. But if the Stranger Morpheus does invade My painful Limbs, my Fancy still awake: Thoughtful of Man, and eager in a Dream Imaginary Blisses gives, and takes: In vain! awake, I find myself alone, Unbless'd, alas! and curse the backward Sex. Thus do I live, from Pleasure quite cut off. Fairing to me no gen'rous Carter brings, No Pears, no Ginger-bread, tho' brown yet sweet; No Filberts I, nor Walnuts crack, nor squeeze The China Orange through its tawny Coat. Troubles immense, tho' mightier still remain. My Whale-bone Hoop, that has so long withstood Pales, Pots, and Doors, and with Circumf'rence wide[illeg.] My virtuous Limbs enclos'd, by frequent Sparks Of Fire's destroy'd. (What will not Fire destroy?) The splinter'd Ribs crack, break, and pierce amain My wounded Skin. In Rags the Canvass hangs; The sevenfold Circlets of the flutt'ring Hoop Uplifted, yields to every Blast of Wind, Southern, or Western, or the bleak North-East, North-East, that sinks the Hearts of hippish Souls. Till Whale-bone, Twitcher, Petticoat and all Descend with Clangor to the rattling Hearth. So when of some great Church the Cupola, Or Minster of renown'd Metropolis; York, Canterbury, or the Height of Pauls, Resisting long the Jaws of rav'nous Time, The Summer's Thunder, and the Winter's Wind, Fam'd many Cent'ries for its stately Strength, Upon some fatal unexpected Day, Smit by the rapid Light'ning's forked Gleam, Admits the Flame, the melted Lead runs down, Their own Destruction sapless Beams increase. The Neighbours with Astonishment are seiz'd, They stare, they scream, they help, they steal, they run, Endeavours vain! unconquer'd, unextinct, Flames domineer aloft; far off refounds The Rack of Chancels, and the Crush of Isles; High Towers hasten to the Vaults below, And proud Cathedrals tumble to the Ground.
