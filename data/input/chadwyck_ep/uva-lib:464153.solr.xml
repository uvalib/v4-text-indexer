      <field name="fulltext">POEMS, &amp;c. Written by Sir JOHN SUCKLING. Printed by his owne Copy. The Lyrick Poems were set in Musick by Mr. Henry Lawes, Gent. of the Kings Chappel, and one of His Majesties Private Musick. On New-years day 1640. To the King. 1 Awake (great Sir) the Sun shines heer, Gives all Your Subjects a New-yeer, Onely we stay till you appear, For thus by us Your Power is understood, He may make fair days, You must make them good, Awake, awake, and take Such Presents as poor men can make, They can adde little unto blisse who cannot wish. 2 May no ill vapour cloud the skie, Bold storms invade the Soveraigntie, But gales of joy, so fresh, so high; That You may think Heav'n sent to try this year What sayl, or burthen, a Kings mind could bear. Awake, awake, &amp;c. 3 May all the discords in Your State (Like those in Musick we create) Be govern'd at so wise a rate, That what would of itself sound harsh, or fright, May be so temper'd that it may delight. Awake, awake, &amp;c. 4 What Conquerors from battels find, Or Lovers when their Doves are kind, Take up henceforth our Masters mind, Make such strange Rapes upon the place, 't may be No longer joy there, but an extasie. Awake, awake, &amp;c. 5 May every pleasure and delight That has or does your sence invite Double this year, save those o'th night: For such a Marriage-bed must know no more Then repetition of what was before. Awake, awake, and take Such Presents as poor men can make, They can add little unto blisse who cannot wish. Loving and Beloved. I There never yet was honest man That ever drove the trade of love; It is impossible, nor can Integrity our ends promove: For Kings and Lovers are alike in this That their chief art in reigne dissembling is. 2 Here we are lov'd, and there we love, Good nature now and passion strive Which of the two should be above, And laws unto the other give. So we false fire with art sometimes discover, And the true fire with the same art do cover. 3 What Rack can Fancy find so high? Here we must Court, and here ingage, Though in the other place we die. Oh! 'tis torture all, and cozenage; And which the harder is I cannot tell, To hide true love, or make false love look well. 4 Since it is thus, God of desire, Give me my honesty again, And take thy brands back, and thy fire; I'me weary of the State I'me in: Since (if the very best should now befal) Loves Triumph, must be Honours Funeral. [If when Don Cupids dart] I If when Don Cupids dart Doth wound a heart, we hide our grief and shun relief; The smart increaseth on that score; For wounds unsearcht but ranckle more. 2 Then if we whine, look pale, And tell our tale, men are in pain for us again; So, neither speaking doth become The Lovers state, nor being dumb. 3 When this I do descry, Then thus think I, love is the fart of every heart: It pains a man when 't is kept close, And others doth offend, when 't is let loose. A Sessions of the Poets. A session was held the other day, And Apollo himself was at it (they say) The Laurel that had been so long reserv'd, Was now to be given to him best deserv'd. And Therefore the wits of the Town came thither, T was strange to see how they flocked together, Each strongly confident of his own way, Thought to gain the Laurel away that day. There Selden, and he sate hard by the chair; Weniman not far off, which was very fair; Sands with Townsend, for they kept no order; Digby and Shillingsworth a little further: And There was Lucans Translator too, and he That makes God speak so bigge in's Poetry; Selwin and Walter, and Bartlets both the brothers; Jack Vaughan and Porter, and divers others. The first that broke silence was good old Ben, Prepar'd before with Canary wine, And he told them plainly he deserv'd the Bayes, For his were calld Works, where others were but Plaies. And Bid them remember how he had purg'd the Stage Of errors, that had lasted many an Age, And he hopes they did not think the silent Woman, The Fox, and the Alchymist out done by no man. Apollo stopt him there, and bade him not go on, 'Twas merit, he said, and not presumption Must carry't; at which Ben turned about, And in great choler offer'd to go out: But Those that were there thought it not fit To discontent so ancient a wit; And therefore Apollo call'd him back agen, And made him mine host of his own new Inne. Tom Carew was next, but he had a fault That would not well stand with a Laureat; His Muse was hard bound, and th'issue of's brain Was seldom brought forth but with trouble and pain. And All that were present there did agree, A Laureat Muse should be easie and free, Yet sure 'twas not that, but 'twas thought that his Grace Consider'd he was well he had a Cup-bearers place. Will. Davenant asham'd of a foolish mischance That he had got lately travelling in France, Modestly hoped the handsomnesse of's Muse Might any deformity about him excuse. And Surely the Company would have been content, If they could have found any President; But in all their Records either in Verse or Prose, There was not one Laureat without a nose. To Will Bartlet sure all the wits meant well, But first they would see how his snow would sell: Will smil'd and swore in their judgements they went lesse, That concluded of merit upon successe. Suddenly taking his place agen, He gave way to Selwin, who streight stept in; But alas! he had been so lately a wit, That Apollo hardly knew him yet. Toby Mathews (pox on him) how came he there? Was whispering nothing in some-bodies ear: When he had the honour to be nam'd in Court, But Sir, you may thank my Lady Carleil for't: For had not her care furnisht you out With something of handsome, without all doubt You and your sorry Lady Muse had been In the number of those that were not let in. In haste from the Court two or three came in, And they brought letters (forsooth) from the Queen, 'Twas discreetly done too, for if th'had come Without them, th'had scarce been let into the room. Suckling next was call'd, but did not appear, But strait one whisperd Apollo i'th'ear, That of all men living he cared not for't, He loved not the Muses so well as his sport; And prized black eyes, or a lucky hit At bowls, above all the Trophies of wit; But Apollo was angry, and publiquely said 'Twere fit that a fine were set upon's head. Wat Montague now stood forth to his tryal, And did not so much as suspect a denial; But witty Apollo asked him first of all If he understood his own Pastoral. For if he could do it, 't would plainly appear He understood more than any man there, And did merit the Bayes above all the rest, But the Mounsier was modest, and silence confest. During these troubles in the Court was hid One that Apollo soon mist, little Cid; And having spied him, call'd him out of the throng, And advis'd him in his ear not to write so strong. Murrey was summon'd, but 't was urg'd that he Was Chief already of another Company. Hales set by himself most gravely did smile To see them about nothing keep such a coil; Apollo had spied him, but knowing his mind Past by, and call'd Faulkland that sate just behind: But He was of late so gone with Divinity, That he had almost forgot his Poetry, Though to say the truth (and Apollo did know it) He might have been both his Priest and his Poet. At length who but an Alderman did appear, At which Will. Davenant began to swear; But wiser Apollo bade him draw nigher, And when he was mounted a little higher Openly declared that the best signe Of good store of wit's to have good store of coyn, And without a Syllable more or lesse said, He put the Laurel on the Aldermans head. At this all the wits were in such a maze That for a good while they did nothing but gaze One upon another, not a man in the place But had discontent writ in great in his face. Onely the small Poets clear'd up again, Out of hope as 't was thought of borrowing, But sure they were out, for he forfeits his Crown When he lends any Poets about the Town. Loves World. In each mans heart that doth begin To love, there's ever fram'd within A little world, for so I found, When first my passion reason drown'd. Instead of Earth unto this frame, Earth, I had a faith was still the same, For to be right it doth behoove It be as that, fixt and not move; Yet as the Earth may sometime shake (For winds shut up will cause a quake) So, often jealousie, and fear, Stolne into mine, cause tremblings there. My Flora was my Sun, for as Sunne, One Sun, so but one Flora was: All other faces borrowed hence Their light and grace, as stars do thence. My hopes I call my Moon; for they Moon Inconstant still, were at no stay; But as my Sun inclin'd to me, Or more or lesse were sure to be: Sometimes it would be full, and then Oh! too too soon decrease agen; Eclip'st sometimes, that't would so fall There would appear no hope at all. My thoughts 'cause infinite they be Must be those many Stars we see; Starres, Of which some wandred at their will, But most on her were fixed still. Fixed Planets. My burning flame and hot desire Must be the Element of fire, Element of fire. Which hath as yet so secret been That it as that was never seen: No Kitching fire, nor eating flame, But innocent, hot but in name; A fire that's starv'd when fed, and gone When too much fewel is laid on. But as it plainly doth appear, That fire subsists by being near The Moons bright Orbe, so I beleeve Ours doth, for hope keeps love alive. My fancy was the Ayre, most free Ayre. And full of mutability, Big with Chimera's, vapours here Innumerable hatcht as there. The Sea's my mind, which calm would be Sea. Were it from winds (my passions) free; But out alas! no Sea I find Is troubled like a Lovers mind. Within it Rocks and Shallows be, Despair and fond credulity. But in this World it were good reason We did distinguish Time and Season; Her presence then did make the Day, And Night shall come when shee's away. Long absence in far distant place Creates the Winter, and the space Winter. She tarryed with me; well I might Call it my Summer of delight. Summer. Diversity of weather came From what she did, and thence had name; Somtimes sh' would smile, that made it fair; And when she laught, the Sun shin'd clear. Sometimes sh'would frown, and sometimes weep, So Clouds and Rain their turns do keep; Sometimes again sh'would be all ice, Extreamly cold, extreamly nice. But soft my Muse, the world is wide, And all at once was not descride: It may fall out some honest Lover The rest hereafter will discover. Song. [Why so pale and wan fond Lover?] Why so pale and wan fond Lover? prethee why so pale? Will, when looking wel can't move her looking ill prevail? prethee why so pale? Why so dull and mute young sinner? prethee why so mute? Will, when speaking well can't win her, saying nothing doe't? prethee why so mute? Quit, quit for shame, this will not move, this cannot take her; If of her self she will not love, nothing can make her: the divel take her. Sonnet. I. [Do'st see how unregarded now] 1 Do'st see how unregarded now that piece of beauty passes? There was a time when I did vow to that alone; but mark the fate of faces; That red and white works now no more on me Then if it could not charm or I not see. 2 And yet the face continues good, and I have still desires, Am still the self same flesh and blood, as apt to melt and suffer from those fires; Oh! some kind power unriddle where it lies, Whether my heart be faulty, or her eyes? 3 She every day her Man does kill, and I as often die; Neither her power then, nor my will can question'd be, what is the mystery? Sure Beauties Empires, like to greater States Have certain periods set, and hidden fates. Sonnet. II. [Of thee (kind boy) I ask no red and white] 1 Of thee (kind boy) I ask no red and white to make up my delight, no odd becomming graces, Black eyes, or little know-not-whats, in faces; Make me but mad enough, give me good store Of Love, for her I Court, I ask no more, 'Tis love in love that makes the sport. 2 There's no such thing as that we beauty call, it is meer cousenage all; for though some long ago Like't certain colours mingled so and so, That doth not tie me now from chusing new, If I a fancy take To black and blue, That fancy doth it beauty make. 3 Tis not the meat, but 'tis the appetite makes eating a delight, and if I like one dish More then another, that a Pheasant is; What in our watches, that in us is found, So to the height and nick We up be wound, No matter by what hand or trick. Sonnet III. [Oh! for some honest Lovers ghost] 1 Oh! for some honest Lovers ghost, Some kind unbodied post Sent from the shades below. I strangely long to know Whether the nobler Chaplets wear, Those that their mistresse scorn did bear, Or those that were us'd kindly. 2 For what-so-e're they tell us here To make those sufferings dear, 'Twill there I fear be found, That to the being crown'd, T'have lov'd alone will not suffice, Unlesse we also have been wise, And have our Loves enjoy'd. 3 What posture can we think him in, That here unlov'd agen Departs, and's thither gone Where each sits by his own? Or how can that Elizium be Where I my Mistresse still must see Circled in others Armes? 4 For there the Judges all are just, And Sophonisba must Be his whom she held dear; Not his who lov'd her here: The sweet Philoclea since she dy'de Lies by her Pirocles his side, Not by Amphialus. 5 Some Bayes (perchance) or Myrtle bough For difference crowns the brow Of those kind souls that were The noble Martyrs here; And if that be the onely odds (As who can tell) ye kinder Gods, Give me the Woman here. To his much honoured, the Lord Lepinton, upon his Translation of Malvezzi his Romulus and Tarquin. It is so rare and new a thing to see Ought that belongs to young Nobility In print (but their own clothes) that we must praise You as we would do those first shew the waies To Arts or to new Worlds: You have begun; Taught travel'd youth what 'tis it should have done: For't has indeed too strong a custome bin To carry out more wit then we bring in. You have done otherwise, brought home (my Lord) The choisest things fam'd Countries do afford: Malvezzi by your means is English grown, And speaks our tongue as well now as his own. Malvezzi, he: whom 'tis as hard to praise To merit, as to imitate his waies. He does not shew us Rome great suddenly, As if the Empire were a Tympany, But gives it natural growth, tells how, and why The little body grew so large and high. Describes each thing so lively, that we are Concern'd our selves before we are aware: And at the wars they and their neighbours wag'd, Each man is present still, and still engag'd. Like a good Prospective he strangely brings Things distant to us: and in these two Kings We see what made greatnesse. And what 't has been Made that greatnesse contemptible again. And all this not tediously deriv'd, But like to Worlds in little Maps contriv'd. 'Tis he that doth the Roman Dame restore, Makes Lucrece chaster for her being whore; Gives her a kind Revenge for Tarquins sin; For ravish't first, she ravisheth again. She says such fine things after't, that we must In spite of vertue thank foul Rape and Lust, Since't was the cause no woman would have had, Though she's of Lucrece side, Tarquin lesse bad. But stay; like one that thinks to bring his friend A mile or two, and sees the journeys end, I straggle on too far: long graces do But keep good stomacks off that would fall too. Against Fruition. Stay here fond youth and ask no more, be wise, Knowing too much long since lost Paradise; The vertuous joyes thou hast, thou would'st should still Last in their pride; and would'st not take it ill If rudely from sweet dreams (and for a toy) Tho' wert wak't? he wakes himself that does enjoy. Fruition adds no new wealth, but destroyes, And while it pleaseth much the palate, cloyes; Who thinks he shall be happyer for that, As reasonably might hope he might grow fat By eating to a Surfet, this once past, What relishes? even kisses loose their tast. Urge not 'tis necessary, alas! we know The homeliest thing which mankind does is so; The World is of a vast extent we see, And must be peopled; Children there must be; So must bread too; but since there are enough Born to the drudgery, what need we plough? Women enjoy'd (what e're before t'have been) Are like Romances read, or sights once seen: Fruition's dull, and spoils the Play much more Than if one read or knew the plot before; 'Tis expectation makes a blessing dear, Heaven were not heaven, if we knew what it were. And as in Prospects we are there pleas'd most Where somthing keeps the eye from being lost, And leaves us room to guesse, so here restraint Holds up delight, that with excesse would faint. They who know all the wealth they have, are poor, Hee's onely rich that cannot tell his store. [There never yet was woman made] 1 There never yet was woman made, nor shall, but to be curst; And oh! that I (fond I) should first of any Lover This truth at my own charge to other fools discover. 2 You that have promis'd to your selves propriety in love, Know womens hearts like straws do move, and what we call Their sympathy, is but love to jett in general. 3 All mankind are alike to them; and though we iron find That never with a Loadstone joyn'd, 'tis not the irons fault, It is because the loadstone yet was never brought. 4 If where a gentle Bee hath fall'n and laboured to his power, A new succeeds not to that Flower, but passes by; 'Tis to be thought, the gallant else-where loads his thigh. 5 For still the flowers ready stand, one buzzes round about, One lights, one tasts, gets in, gets out all, all waies use them, Till all their sweets are gone, and all again refuse them. Song. [No, no, fair Heretick, it needs must be] 1 No, no, fair Heretick, it needs must be But an ill love in me, And worse for thee; For were it in my power, To love thee now this hower More then I did the last; I would then so fall I might not love at all; Love that can flow, and can admit increase, Admits as well an ebbe, and may grow lesse. 2 True Love is still the same; the Torrid Zones, And those more frigid ones It must not know: For love grown cold or hot, Is lust, or friendship, not The thing we have. For that's a flame would dye Held down, or up too high: Then think I love more then I can expresse, And would love more could I but love thee lesse. To my Friend Will. Davenant; upon his Poem of Madagascar. What mighty Princes Poets are? those things The great ones stick at, and our very Kings Lay down, they venter on; and with great ease, Discover, conquer, what, and where they please. Some Flegmatick Sea-Captain, would have staid For money now, or victuals; not have waid Anchor without 'em; Thou (Will) do'st not stay So much as for a wind, but go'st away, Land'st, view'st the Country; fight'st, put'st all to rout, Before another could be putting out! And now the news in Town is; Dav'nant's come From Madagascar, Fraught with Laurel home; And welcom (Will) for the first time, but prithee In thy next Voyage, bring the gold too with thee. To my Friend Will. Davenant on his other Poems. Thou hast redeem'd us, Wil, and future Times Shall not account unto the Age's crimes Dearth of pure wit: since the great Lord of it (Donne) parted hence, no Man has ever writ So neer him, in's own way: I would commend Particulars, but then, how should I end Without a Volume? Ev'ry line of thine Would ask (to praise it right) twenty of mine. [Love, Reason, Hate, did once bespeak] 1 Love, Reason, Hate, did once bespeak Three mates to play at barley-break; Love, Folly took; and Reason, Fancy; And Hate consorts with Pride; so dance they: Love coupled last, and so it fell That Love and Folly were in hell. 2 They break, and Love would Reason meet, But Hate was nimbler on her feet; Fancy looks for Pride, and thither Hyes, and they two hugge together: Yet this new coupling still doth tell That Love and Folly were in hell. 3 The rest do break again, and Pride Hath now got Reason on her side; Hate and Fancy meet, and stand Untoucht by Love in Folly's hand; Folly was dull, but Love ran well, So Love and Folly were in hell. Song. [I prethee spare me, gentle Boy] 1 I prethee spare me, gentle Boy, Presse me no more for that slight toy, That foolish trifle of an heart, I swear it will not do its part, Though thou dost thine, employ'st thy power and art. 2 For through long custom it has known The little secrets, and is grown Sullen and wise, will have its will, And like old Hawks pursues that still That makes least sport, flies onely where 't can kill. 3 Some youth that has not made his story, Will think perchance the pain's the glory; And mannerly sit out Loves Feast; I shall be carving of the best, Rudely call for the last course 'fore the rest. 4 And oh! when once that course is past, How short a time the Feast doth last; Men rise away, and scarce say grace, Or civilly once thank the face That did invite; but seek another place. Upon my Lady Carliles walking in Hampton Court garden. Dialogue. T. C., I. S. Thom. Didst thou not find the place inspir'd, And flow'rs as if they had desir'd No other Sun, start from their beds, And for a sight steal out their heads? Heardst thou not musick when she talk't? And didst not find that as she walkt She threw rare perfumes all about Such as bean-blossoms newly out, Or chafed spices give?— J. S. I must confesse those perfumes (Tom) I did not smell; nor found that from Her passing by, ought sprung up new, The flow'rs had all their birth from you; For I pass't o're the self same walk, And did not find one single stalk Of any thing that was to bring This unknown after after spring. Thom. Dull and insensible, could'st see A thing so near a Deity Move up and down, and feel no change? J. S. None, and so great, were alike strange, I had my Thoughts, but not your way, All are not born (Sir) to the Bay; Alas! Tom, I am flesh and blood, And was consulting how I could In spite of masks and hoods descry The parts deni'd unto the eye; I was undoing all she wore, And had she walkt but one turn more, Eve in her first state had not been More naked, or more plainly seen. Thom. 'T was well for thee she left the place, There is great danger in that face; But had'st thou view'd her legg and thigh, And upon that discovery Search't after parts that are more dear (As Fancy seldom stops so near) No time or age had ever seen So lost a thing as thou hadst been. To Mr. Davenant for Absence. Wonder not if I stay not here, Hurt Lovers (like to wounded Deer) Must shift the place; for standing still Leaves too much time to know our ill: Where there is a Traytor eye That lets in from th'enemy All that may supplant an heart, 'Tis time the Chief should use some Art; Who parts the object from the sence, Wisely cuts off intelligence. O how quickly men must die, Should they stand all Loves Battery; Persindaes eyes great mischief do, So do we know the Canon too; But men are safe at distance still, Where they reach not, they cannot kill. Love is a fit, and soon is past, Ill dyet onely makes it last; Who is still looking, gazing ever, Drinks wine i'th' very height o'th' Fever. Against Absence. My whining Lover, what needs all These vows of life Monastical? Despairs, retirements, jealousies, And subtile sealing up of eyes? Come, come, be wise; return again, A finger burnt's as great a pain; And the same Physick, self same art Cures that, would cure a flaming heart: Would'st thou whilst yet the fire is in But hold it to the fire again. If you (Dear Sir) the plague have got, What matter is't whether or not They let you in the same house lie, Or carry you abroad to die? He whom the plague, or Love once takes, Every Room a Pest-House makes. Absence were good if't were but sence That onely holds th'Intelligence: Pure love alone no hurt would do, But love is love, and magick too; Brings a mistresse a thousand miles, And the sleight of looks beguiles, Makes her entertain thee there, And the same time your Rival here; And (oh! the divel) that she should Say finer things now then she would; So nobly Fancy doth supply What the dull sence lets fall and die. Beauty like mans old enemy's known To tempt him most when hee's alone: The ayre of some wild o'regrown wood, Or pathlesse Grove is the Boyes food. Return then back, and feed thine eye, Feed all thy sences, and feast high. Spare dyet is the cause Love lasts, For Surfets sooner kill than Fasts. A Supplement of an imperfect Copy of Verses of Mr. Wil. Shakespears, By the Author. The first two stanzas are a variant of text appearing in Shakespeare's Lucrece. 1 One of her hands, one of her cheeks lay under, Cozening the pillow of a lawful kisse, Which therefore swel'd, and seem'd to part asunder, As angry to be rob'd of such a blisse: The one lookt pale, and for revenge did long, While t'other blusht, cause it had done the wrong. 2 Out of the bed the other fair hand was On a green sattin quilt, whose perfect white Lookt like a Dazie in a field of grasse, Thus far Shakespear.And shew'd like unmelt snow unto the sight, There lay this pretty perdue, safe to keep The rest oth' body that lay fast asleep. 3 Her eyes (and therefore it was night) close laid, Strove to imprison beauty till the morn, But yet the doors were of such fine stuffe made, That it broke through, and shew'd it self in scorn. Throwing a kind of light about the place, which turnd to smiles stil as't came near her face. 4 Her beams (which some dul men call'd hair) divided Part with her cheeks, part with her lips did sport, But these, as rude, her breath put by still; some Wiselyer downwards sought, but falling short, Curl'd back in rings, and seem'd to turn agen To bite the part so unkindly held them in. [That none beguiled be by times quick flowing] That none beguiled be by times quick flowing, Lovers have in their hearts a clock still going; For though Time be nimble, his motions are quicker and thicker where Love hath his notions: Hope is the main spring on which moves desire, And these do the lesse wheels, fear, joy, inspire; the ballance is thought, evermore clicking and striking, and ne're giving ore Occasions the hand which still's moving round, Till by it the Critical hour may be found, And when that falls out, it will strike kisses, strange blisses, and what you best like. [Tis now since I sate down before] 1 Tis now since I sate down before That foolish Fort, a heart; (Time strangely spent) a Year, and more, And still I did my part: 2 Made my approaches, from her hand Unto her lip did rise, And did already understand The language of her eyes. 3 Proceeded on with no lesse Art, My Tongue was Engineer; I thought to undermine the heart By whispering in the ear. 4 When this did nothing, I brought down Great Canon-oaths, and shot A thousand thousand to the Town, And still it yeelded not. 5 I then resolv'd to starve the place By cutting off all kisses, Praysing and gazing on her face, And all such little blisses. 6 To draw her out, and from her strength, I drew all batteries in: And brought my self to lie at length As if no siege had been. 7 When I had done what man could do, And thought the place mine owne, The Enemy lay quiet too, And smil'd at all was done. 8 I sent to know from whence, and where, These hopes, and this relief? A Spie inform'd, Honour was there, And did command in chief. 9 March, march (quoth I) the word straight give, Lets lose no time, but leave her: That Giant upon ayre will live, And hold it out for ever. 10 To such a place our Camp remove As will no siege abide; I hate a fool that starves her Love Onely to feed her pride. Upon my Lord Brohalls Wedding. Dialogue. S., B. S. In bed dull man? When Love and Hymens Revels are begun, And the Church Ceremonis past and done. B. Why who's gone mad to day? S. Dull Heretick, thou wouldst say, He that is gone to Heaven's gone astray; Brohall our gallant friend Is gone to Church as Martyrs to the fire: Who marry differ but i'th'end, Since both do take The hardest way to what they most desire: Nor staid he till the formal Priest had done, But ere that part was finisht, his begun: Which did reveal The hast and eagernesse men have to seal That long to tell the money. A sprigg of Willow in his hat he wore, (The loosers badge and liv'ry heretofore) But now so ordered that it might be taken By lookers on, forsaking as forsaken. And now and then A careles smile broke forth, which spoke his mind, And seem'd to say she might have been more kind. When this (dear Jack) I saw Thought I How weak is Lovers Law? The bonds made there (like gypsies knots) with ease Are fast and loose, as they that hold them please. But was the fair Nymphs praise or power lesse That led him captive now to happinesse? 'Cause she did not a forreign aid despise, But enterr'd breaches made by others eyes: The Gods forbid, There must be some to shoot and batter down, Others to force and to take in the Town. To Hawkes (good Jack) and hearts There may Be sev'ral waies and Arts; One watches them perchance, and makes them tame: Another, when they're ready, shews them game. [Whether these lines do find you out] Sir, Whether these lines do find you out, Putting or clearing of a doubt; (Whether Predestination, Or reconciling three in one, Or the unriddling how men die, And live at once eternally, Now take you up) know 'tis decreed You straight bestride the Colledge Steed: Leave Socinus and the Schoolmen, (Which Jack Bond swears do but fool men) And come to Town; 'tis fit you show Your self abroad, that men may know (What e're some learned men have guest) That Oracles are not yet ceas't: There you shall find the wit, and wine Flowing alike, and both divine: Dishes, with names not known in books, And lesse amongst the Colledge-Cooks, With sauce so pregnant that you need Not stay till hunger bids you seed. The sweat of learned Johnsons brain, And gentle Shakespear's eas'er strain, A hackney-coach conveys you to, In spite of all that rain can do: And for your eighteen pence you sit. The Lord and Judge of all fresh wit. News in one day as much w'have here As serves all Windsor for a year, And which the Carrier brings to you, After 't has here been found not true. Then think what Company's design'd To meet you here, men so refin'd, Their very common talk at boord, Makes wise, or mad a young Court-Lord, And makes him capable to be Umpire in's Fathers Company. Where no disputes nor forc't defence Of a mans person for his sence Take up the time; all strive to be Masters of truth, as victory: And where you come, I'de boldly swear A Synod might as eas'ly erre. Against Fruition. Fye upon hearts that burn with mutual fire; I hate two minds that breath but one desire: Were I to curse th'unhallow'd sort of men, I'de wish them to love, and be lov'd agen. Love's a Camelion, that lives on meer ayre; And surfets when it comes to grosser fare: 'Tis petty Jealousies, and little fears, Hopes joyn'd with doubts, and joyes with April tears, That crowns our Love with pleasures: these are gone When once we come to full Fruition. Like waking in a morning, when all night Our fancy hath been fed with true delight. Oh! what a stroke't would be! Sure I should die, Should I but hear my mistresse once say, I. That monster expectation feeds too high For any Woman e're to satisfie: And no brave Spirit ever car'd for that Which in Down-beds with ease he could come at. Shee's but an honest whore that yeelds, although She be as cold as ice, as pure as snow: He that enjoys her hath no more to say But keep us Fasting if you'l have us pray. Then fairest Mistresse, hold the power you have, By still denying what we still do crave: In Keeping us in hopes strange things to see That never were, nor are, nor e're shall be. A Ballade. Upon a Wedding. I tell thee Dick where I have been, Where I the rarest things have seen; Oh things without compare! Such sights again cannot be found In any place on English ground, Be it at Wake, or Fair. At Charing-Crosse, hard by the way Where we (thou know'st) do sell our Hay, There is a house with stairs; And there did I see comming down Such folk as are not in our Town, Vorty at least, in Pairs. Amongst the rest, one Pest'lent fine, (His beard no bigger though then thine) Walkt on before the rest: Our Landlord looks like nothing to him: The King (God blesse him) 'twould undo him, Should he go still so drest. At Course-a-Park, without all doubt, He should have first been taken out By all the Maids i'th'Town: Though lusty Roger there had been, Or little George upon the Green, Or Vincent of the Crown. But wot you what? the youth was going To make an end of all his woing; The Parson for him staid: Yet by his leave (for all his haste) He did not so much wish all past, (Perchance) as did the maid. The maid (and thereby hangs a tale) For such a maid no Whitson-ale Could ever yet produce: No Grape that's kindly ripe, could be So round, so plump, so soft as she, Nor half so full of Juyce. Her finger was so small, the Ring Would not stay on which they did bring, It was too wide a Peck: And to say truth (for out it must) It lookt like the great Collar (just) About our young Colts neck. Her feet beneath her Petticoat, Like little mice stole in and out, As if they fear'd the light: But oh! she dances such a way! No Sun upon an Easter day Is half so fine a sight. He would have kist her once or twice, But she would not, she was nice, She would not do't in sight, And then she lookt as who should say I will do what I list to day; And you shall do't at night. Her Cheeks so rare a white was on, No Dazy makes comparison, (Who sees them is undone) For streaks of red were mingled there, Such as are on a Katherne Pear, (The side that's next the Sun.) Her lips were red, and one was thin, Compar'd to that was next her chin; (Some Bee had stung it newly.) But (Dick) her eyes so guard her face; I durst no more upon them gaze, Then on the Sun in July. Her mouth so small when she does speak, Thou'dst swear her teeth her words did break, That they might passage get, But she so handled still the matter, They came as good as ours, or better, And are not spent a whit. If wishing should be any sin, The Parson himself had guilty bin; (She lookt that day so purely,) And did the youth so oft the feat At night, as some did in conceit, It would have spoil'd him, surely. Just in the nick the Cook knockt thrice, And all the waiters in a trice His summons did obey, Each serving man with dish in hand, Marcht boldly up, like our Train'd Band, Presented, and away. When all the meat was on the Table. What man of knife, or teeth, was able To stay to be intreated? And this the very reason was, Before the Parson could say Grace, The Company was seated. The bus'nesse of the Kitchin's great, For it is fit that men should eat; Nor was it there deni'd: Passion oh me! how I run on! There's that that would be thought upon, (I trow) besides the Bride. Now hatts fly off, and youths carrouse; Healths first go round, and then the house, The Brides came thick and thick: And when 'twas nam'd anothers health, Perhaps he made it hers by stealth. (And who could help it? Dick) O'th' sodain up they rise and dance; Then sit again and sigh, and glance: Then dance again and kisse: Thus sev'ral waies the time did passe, Till ev'ry Woman wisht her place, And ev'ry Man wisht his. By this time all were stoln aside To counsel and undresse the Bride; But that he must not know: But yet 'twas thought he ghest her mind, And did not mean to stay behind Above an hour or so. When in he came (Dick) there she lay Like new-faln snow melting away, ('Twas time I trow to part) Kisses were now the onely stay, Which soon she gave, as who would say, Good Boy! with all my heart. But just as heav'ns would have to crosse it, In came the Bridemaids with the Posset: The Bridegroom eat in spight; For had he left the Women to't It would have cost two hours to do't, Which were too much that night. At length the candles out and out, All that they had not done, they do't: What that is, who can tell? But I beleeve it was no more Then thou and I have done before With Bridget, and with Nell. [My dearest Rival, least our Love] My dearest Rival, least our Love Should with excentrique motion move, Before it learn to go astray, Wee'l teach and set it in a way, And such directions give unto't, That it shall never wander foot. Know first then, we will serve as true For one poor smile, as we would do If we had what our higher flame, Or our vainer wish could frame. Impossible shall be our hope; And Love shall onely have his scope To joyn with Fancy now and then, And think what reason would condemn: And on these grounds wee'l love as true, As if they were most sure t'ensue: And chastly for these things wee'l stay, As if to morrow were the day. Mean time we two will teach our hearts In Loves burdens bear their parts: Thou first shall sigh, and say shee's fair; And I'le still answer, past compare. Thou shalt set out each part o'th face, While I extol each little grace; Thou shalt be ravisht at her wit; And I, that she so governs it: Thou shalt like well that hand, that eye, That lip, that look, that majesty; And in good language them adore: While I want words, and do it more. Yea we will sit and sigh a while, And with soft thoughts some time beguil; But straight again break out and praise All we had done before new-waies. Thus will we do till paler death Come with a warrant for our breath, And then whose fate shall be to die First of us two, by Legacy Shall all his store bequeath, and give His love to him that shall survive; For no one stock can ever serve To love so much as shee'l deserve. Song. [Honest Lover whosoever] 1 Honest Lover whosoever, If in all thy love there ever Was one wav'ring thought, if thy flame Were not still even, still the same: Know this, Thou lov'st amisse, And to love true, Thou must begin again, and love anew. 2 If when she appears i'th' room, Thou dost not quake, and art struck dumb, And in striving this to cover Dost not speak thy words twice over, Know this, Thou lov'st amisse, And to love true, Thou must begin again, and love anew. 3 If fondly thou dost not mistake, And all defects for graces take, Perswad'st thy self that jeasts are broken, When she hath little or nothing spoken, Know this, Thou lov'st amisse, And to love true, Thou must begin again, and love anew. 4 If when thou appear'st to be within, Thou lett'st not men ask and ask agen, And when thou answer'st, if it be To what was askt thee properly, Know this, Thou lov'st amisse, And to love true Thou must begin again, and love anew. 5 If when thy stomack calls to eat, Thou cutt'st not fingers 'steed of meat, And with much gazing on her face Dost not rise hungry from the place, Know this, Thou lov'st amisse, And to love true, Thou must begin again, and love anew. 6 If by this thou dost discover That thou art no perfect Lover, And desiring to love true, Thou dost begin to love anew: Know this, Thou lov'st amisse, And to love true, Thou must begin again, and love anew. Upon two Sisters. Beleev't yong Man, I can as eas'ly tell How many yards and inches 'tis to hell; Unriddle all predestination, Or the nice points we now dispute upon, Had the three Goddesses been just as fair, It had not been so easily decided And sure the apple must have been divided: It must, it must; hee's impudent, dares say Which is the handsomer till one's away. And it was necessary it should be so; Wise Nature did foresee it, and did know When she had fram'd the Eldest, that each heart Must at the first sight feel the blind god's dart: And sure as can be, had she made but one, No plague had been more sure destruction; For we had lik't, lov'd, burnt to ashes too, In half the time that we are chusing now: Variety, and equal objects make The busie eye still doubtful which to take; This lip, this hand, this foot, this eye, this face, The others body, gesture, or her grace: And whilst we thus dispute which of the two, We unresolv'd go out, and nothing do. He sure is happy'st that has hopes of either, Next him is he that sees them both together. To his Rival. Now we have taught our Love to know That it must creep where't cannot go, And be for once content to live, Since here it cannot have to thrive; It will not be amisse t'enquire What fuel should maintain this fire: For fires do either flame too high, Or where they cannot flame, they die. First then (my half but better heart) Know this must wholy be her part; (For thou and I, like Clocks, are wound Up to the height, and must move round) She then by still denying what We fondly crave, shall such a rate Set on each trifle, that a kisse Shall come to be the utmost blisse. Where sparks and fire do meet with tinder, Those sparks meer fire will still engender: To make this good, no debt shall be From service or fidelity; For she shall ever pay that score, By onely bidding us do more: So (though she still a niggard be) In graceing, where none's due, shee's free: The favors she shall cast on us, (Least we should grow presumptuous) Shall not with too much love be shown, Nor yet the common way still done; But ev'ry smile and little glance Shall look half lent, and half by chance: The Ribbon, Fan, or Muffe that she Would should be kept by thee or me, Should not be giv'n before to many, But neither thrown to's when there's any; So that her self should doubtful be Whether 'twere fortune flung't, or she. She shall not like the thing we do Sometimes, and yet shall like it too; Nor any notice take at all Of what, we gone, she would extol: Love she shall feed, but fear to nourish, For where fear is, love cannot flourish; Yet live it must, nay must and shall, While Desdemona is at all: But when shee's gone, then Love shall die, And in her grave buried lie. Farewel to Love. 1 Well shadow'd Landskip, fare-ye-well: How I have lov'd you, none can tell, At least so well As he that now hates more Then e're he lov'd before. 2 But my dear nothings, take your leave, No longer must you me deceive, Since I perceive All the deceit, and know Whence the mistake did grow. 3 As he whose quicker eye doth trace A false star shot to a mark't place, Do's run apace, And thinking it to catch, A gelly up do's snatch. 4 So our dull souls tasting delight Far off, by sence, and appetite, Think that is right And real good; when yet 'Tis but the Counterfeit. 5 Oh! how I glory now; that I Have made this new discovery! Each wanton eye Enflam'd before: no more Will I encrease that score. 6 If I gaze, now, 'tis but to see What manner of deaths-head 'twill be, When it is free From that fresh upper skin; The gazers Joy, and sin. 7 The Gun and glist'ning which with art And studi'd method, in each part Hangs down the heart, Looks (just) as if, that day Snails there had crawl'd the Hay. 8 The Locks, that curl'd o're each eare be, Hang like two Master-worms to me, That (as we see) Have tasted to the rest Two holes, where they lik't best. 9 A quick coarse me-thinks I spy In ev'ry woman; and mine eye, At passing by, Check, and is troubled, just As if it rose from Dust. 10 They mortifie, not heighten me: These of my sins the Glasses be: And here I see How I have lov'd before. And so I love no more. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following two poems are taken from Suckling's verse drama AGLAURA. SONG. [Why so pale and wan fond Lover?] Why so pale and wan fond Lover? Prithee why so pale? Will, when looking well can't move her, Looking ill prevaile? Prithee why so pale? Why so dull and mute young Sinner? Prithee why so mute? Will, when speaking well can't win her, Saying nothing doo't? Prithee why so mute? Quit, quit, for shame, this will not move This cannot take her; If of her selfe shee will not Love, Nothing can make her, The Devill take her. SONG. [No, no, faire Heretique, it needs must bee] [1] No, no, faire Heretique, it needs must bee But an ill Love in mee, And worse for thee. For were it in my Power, To love thee now this hower, More than I did the last; I would then so fall, I might not Love at all; Love that can flow, and can admit increase, Admitts as well an Ebb, and may grow lesse. 2 True Love is stil the same; the torrid Zones, And those more frigid ones, It must not know: For Love growne cold or hot, Is Lust, or Friendship, not The thing wee have; For that's a flame would die, Held downe, or up to high: Then think I love more than I can expresse, And would love more, could I but love thee lesse.</field>
