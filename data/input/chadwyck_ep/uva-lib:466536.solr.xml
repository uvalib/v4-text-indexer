      <field name="fulltext">OF MEN AND WOMEN GENERALLY. VIOLET. She stood where I had used to wait For her, beneath the gaunt old yew, And near a column of the gate That open'd on the avenue. The moss that capp'd its granite ball, The grey and yellow lichen stains, The ivy on the old park wall, Were glossy with the morning rains. She stood, amid such tearful gloom; But close behind her, out of reach, Lay many a mound of orchard bloom, And trellis'd blossoms of the peach. Those peaches blooming to the south, Those orchard blossoms, seem'd to me Like kisses of her rosy mouth, Revived on trellis and on tree: Kisses, that die not when the thrill Of joy that answer'd them is mute; But such as turn to use, and fill The summer of our days with fruit. And she, impressing half the sole Of one small foot against the ground, Stood resting on the yew-tree bole, A-tiptoe to each sylvan sound: She, whom I thought so still and shy, Express'd in every subtle move Of lifted hand and open eye The large expectancy of love; Until, with all her dewy hair Dissolved into a golden flame Of sunshine on the sunless air, She came to meet me as I came. But in her face no sunlight shone; No sunlight, but the sad unrest Of shade, that sinks from zone to zone When twilight glimmers in the west. What grief had touch'd her on the nerve? For grief alone it is, that stirs The full ineffable reserve Of quiet spirits such as hers: 'Twas this—that we had met to part; That I was going, and that she Had nothing left but her true heart, Made strong by memories of me. What wonder then, she quite forgot Her old repression and control, And loosed at once and stinted not The tender tumult of her soul? What wonder, that she droop'd and lay In silence, and at length in tears, On that which should have been the stay And comfort of her matron years? But from her bosom, as she leant, She took a nested violet, And gave it me—“because 'twas meant For those who never can forget.” This is the flower: 'tis dry, or wet With something I may call my own. Why did I rouse this old regret? It irks me, now, to be alone: Triumphs, indeed! Why, after all, My life has but a leaden hue: My heart grows like the heart of Saul, For hatred, and for madness too. Why sits that smirking minstrel there? I hate him, and the songs he sings; They only bring the fond despair Of inaccessible sweet things: I will avoid him once for all, Or slay him in my righteous ire— Alas, my javelin hits the wall, And spares the minstrel and his lyre! Yea, and the crown upon my head, The crown of wealth for which I strove, Shall fall away ere I be dead To yon slight boy who sings of love! Why are we captive, such as I, Mature in age and strong in will, To one who harps so plaintively? I struck at him—why lives he still? Why lives he still? Because the ruth Of those pure days may never die: He lives, because his name is Youth; Because his harp is—Memory. UNDER THE PORCH. She sits in the sunshine under the porch, Under the porch when the sun is low; And over her forehead and over her hair The clematis-shadows come and go. Tracery meet for a face like hers! For faces like hers you may often see In the rich arabesques of a bridal book, Looking out through a golden filigree. And have you not noticed the tints that move, Move and burn on the white stone floor, When the sunset comes in a ruby blaze Through the oriel over the old church door? Just so sweet is her silent face— Silent ever and pale as snow— When thoughts enrich it, and blushes glide Over her cheek, when the sun is low. She sits with her knitting spread over her knee, Over her kirtle and over her barm; And thinks, perhaps, as her fingers fly, Of a lazy white hand and a pearly arm. For hers are ruddy, and not so soft, Nothing so soft, as a wife's would be Who fondled her rings, and who folded her palms, And never did aught for herself or me. Ah, she may long for a lady's hand— A hand that freezes you whilst it yields; But I knew better, the day we met In the lane that leads to the harvest fields. What was it I whisper'd her under the thorn, Under the black-thorn beside the well? None may know; but the breeze that heard, And the throstles that sang to us,—they can tell! And what was it she said with her eyes that day— Two blue eyes and a brow above All curtain'd in from the peering light, Till nothing beheld them but I—and Love? So at last through the shadows we turn'd away, Turn'd and linger'd across the farm; And it was not a stool nor a milking-pail Whereon she rested her rosy arm. Slowly I felt for her hand, and found All her bonny brown hand in mine, Thrilling it through, as a cold white vase Flushes and warms with its core of wine. I said, “Beloved, if this was all— All that frighten'd you then from me; 'Twas, oh, how silly! to think and say Working and loving could never agree! “Has not your spirit its own sweet calm, Calm as pure as a lady knows? Are you not fill'd with a woman's heart, Blithe in summer, and braced in snows? “Love not your eyes to gaze and dream, Gaze and glisten at even and morn; Watching, all over the fragrant earth, New surprises of beauty born? “Ah, what maundering words are these! Words you know not, but things you feel; And all you know not, and all you know, Rings down in my heart to a marriage-peal. “So leave your silly brown hand in mine, Mine, that gather'd it—you know where; Mine, that set it to seek and find Nobler food than a farmer's fare. “And partlet is gone to her roost, so come— Come from the breath of the sleeping kine, From spotless ingle and shining floor, And chambers smelling of eglantine; “Come forth, with music between your lips— Pastoral music, soft and slow; And then, beloved, sit down by me Under the porch, while the moon is low.” THE WHALER FLEET. Full merrily sail'd our whaler fleet When the wind blew out to sea; And many a one came forth to greet Each good ship's company. For there was the Dove and the Good Intent (How the wind blew out to sea!) And the Polly o'Sleights with her bran-new sails; But the Mary Jane for me! Oh, Captain Thwaites of the Mary Jane, When the wind blew out to sea, Full many a time his ship had sail'd, Full many a time had he. He has Jack of Grosmont and Tom o'the staith, (How the wind blew out to sea!) And Handsome Jim from Hayburn Wyke; But 'twas Robin Hood Will for me. My Willy he kiss'd me before them all, When the wind blew out to sea; My Willy he stood the last on deck A-waving his cap to me. So off they sail'd out over the main, While the wind blew out to sea; Till the ice was all under their beamed bows, And the ice drove under their lee. The months they went and the months they came, And the wind blew hard at sea; And many a time in the stormy nights My mammy she wept with me. But when the harvest moon came round, And the wind blew in from sea, 'Twas merrily came our whaler fleet All home from the north country. The folk they call'd and the folk they ran, And the wind blew in from sea; From the thick of the town to the lighthouse tower, 'Twas throng as throng could be. I saw them atop of the old church stairs, When the wind blew in from sea; And the waves danced under their beamed bows, And the foam flew under their lee. I saw them at foot of the old church stairs, When the wind blew in from sea; And the foremost ship of our whaler fleet Was rounding the lighthouse quay. Oh, there's the Dove and the Good Intent, (Still the wind blows in from sea), And the red red sails of the Polly o'Sleights— Her men are plain to see. Now every one hath pass'd the bar, And the wind blows in from sea; And every one in harbour lies, Right up against the quay. But where, oh where, is the Mary Jane, Now the wind blows in from sea? There's many a lad hath clipt his lass, And when doth my lad clip me? Oh, tell me where is the Mary Jane, For the wind blows in from sea? “The Mary Jane went down by her head With all her company!” Now take me home to my mammy so dear, Though the wind blows in from sea; There's never a billow rolls over my lad, But I wish it roll'd over me! And take me home, for I care not now If the wind blows in from sea: My Willy he lies in the deeps of the dead, But his heart lives on in me. DUCIE OF THE DALE. Fair Ducie with her reaping-hook Went homeward through the vale, Where shaws are steep and waters deep, High up in Harwood Dale. The rooks were cawing overhead; The beck was fresh in flow; The hills were red with hazy light; The sun was large and low: She had not walk'd a mile or more, A mile, but barely twain, When she was ware of some one there Came riding up the lane. “Now who are you,” the stranger said, “You lissome lass and blithe? And is it in John Ashton's fields To-day ye whet the scythe?” He look'd upon her bonny face Or ere he spake; and yet He saw not that her lips were closed, And both her eyes were wet! “Kind sir, you're tied to come frae far, Or you would know the tale; John Ashton's dead this very day,” Said Ducie of the Dale; “We ken not where the body lies, Nor how he came to die; But he was slain, the neighbours say, Through some foul jealousy.” “Now God defend your father's house, The homestead and the farm! But who could be John Ashton's foes? And who should do him harm? “For, as I rode by Hackness woods And sweet Saint Hilda's cell, The sawmill folks they told me there He was both wick and well.” “I wish he was!” the maiden said; “To bring him back to me I'd creep by night round Hilda's cell Upon my bended knee: “For, sir, he was my master dear, My sweetheart true and all; And while he lived, to me and mine No evil could befall. “It chanced upon the Lammas tide (I mind the day so well Because for him we all of us Were reaping, down the dell), “While I was throng with binding work, And stooping at the sheaves, He puts a posy in my hair Of poppies and of leaves, “And ‘See,’ he says, ‘upon your head How close they stick, the flowers! So my heart will, through good or ill, For ever stick to yours.’ “'Tis but a twelvemonth's time since then— And now, to think he's gone! But I'll awand we'll know the hand That did it, ere we've done!” Now was it fear, or fret of spur, Or sudden strain of nerve, That shook the rider in his seat, And made his good horse swerve? But, if 'twere pity, if 'twere pain, His voice was thick and low, And “'Tis no news,” he said, “to hear You loved John Ashton so! “I knew you, and I came to see— But since he's dead, with you I'll go at once to seek the corpse; And haply find it, too!” Full simple was the lassie's heart, For all her angry tears: She would have fear'd her lover's death; She had no other fears: She laid her reaping-hook aside, And stoop'd beneath the boughs, And follow'd with undoubting foot Among the hazel knowes. A shaggy fell was just beyond; The village lights were far; And all was dusk, and all was still, Beneath the evening star: Her mother was a mile away: No ear on earth to know What sounds might scare the hooting owl Or hush the beck below.— That night a stranger horseman rode Full fiercely down the glen: And he may ride, or he may rest, Or he may come again, But never more shall Ducie reap The harvests of the vale: Her maiden sleep is sound and deep At foot of Harwood Dale. SHADY VALLEY. The time was towards the heats of June, And all the mellow afternoon With my ripe heart was just in tune, As I lay a-dreaming. For yes, my heart was ripe with love; The very airs that stirr'd the grove Blew kisses o'er me from above, As I lay a-dreaming. The river glided smoothly by— The blue bright bird shot silently Between my covert and the sky As I lay a-dreaming. By drooping alders doubly bound, The water slid without a sound Until, below the rooted ground Where I lay a-dreaming, It smote a bank of ruddy loam, Where, underneath, a secret dome Of pebbles fretted it to foam As I lay a-dreaming. But further, where the stream was wide, The kine were standing side by side, Cooling their knees against the tide, As I lay a-dreaming. And still beyond, were orchards green, Red cottage roofs, and in between Bright meadows, where the scythe had been While I lay a-dreaming. And over all, the hollow hills, Fill'd with that purple light, which fills Our hearts too with such regal thrills, As we lie a-dreaming. But my low nest was shut within To such a leafy calm, wherein My thoughts went freely out and in As I lay a-dreaming. The squirrel on his branch at play— The blossom falling from the may— No creatures moved but such as they, Where I lay a-dreaming. So sweet a spot, so soft a breeze— Such beauty of enfolding trees! Ah, what could mar my luscious ease As I lay a-dreaming? A country wench came by, to see Whereas her missing kine should be; And this is what she said to me As I lay a-dreaming: “Git oop, ye dawdlin' gaapin' loon! Ah'd liever gang mah waas te t' toon An' fettle t' sheep this efternoon Nor lig theer a-dreamin’!” I look'd at her in strange surprise: I could not think in anywise She was an angel from the skies, Though I lay a-dreaming. For oh, too deep was the disguise: The hand with which she veil'd her eyes Seem'd like a Titan's hand in size, As I lay a-dreaming. She was a woman though, and young— The very creature I had sung In fancy, with a poet's tongue, As I lay a-dreaming. Therefore I spake and answer'd her: “Maiden, you do but come to stir My soul, and make it joyfuller To lie here a-dreaming. “For you too, gracious as a fawn, By ferny glade and mossy lawn Full oft have loved, at eve or dawn, To lie thus a-dreaming; “And all the interwoven grace Of sound and hue that fill'd the place Has doubtless ‘pass'd into your face,’ As you lay a-dreaming. “Oh, you then, nursed in summer woods, And lull'd by rolling waterfloods, Will give me leave, in these high moods, To lie here a-dreaming.” The maiden stared, but answer'd not: Yet, striding slowly from the spot, I heard her say—I know not what— As I lay a-dreaming. “You chap's a snivellin' tiv hissell, An' wat he meeans Ah canna tell; He's daft, Ah doot, or droonk wi' yell, Te lig theer a-dreamin’.” MARY ANERLEY. Little Mary Anerley, sitting on the stile, Why do you blush so red, and why so strangely smile? Somebody has been with you—somebody, I know, Left that sunset on your cheek, left you smiling so! Gentle Mary Anerley, waiting by the wall, Waiting in the chestnut walk, where the snowy blossoms fall, Somebody is coming there—somebody, I'm sure, Knows your eyes are full of love, knows your heart is pure. Happy Mary Anerley, looking oh so fair, There's a ring upon your hand, and there's myrtle in your hair! Somebody is with you now—somebody, I see, Looks into your trusting face very tenderly! Quiet Mary Forester, sitting by the shore, Rosy faces at your knee, roses round the door— Somebody is coming home; somebody, I know, Made you sorry when he sail'd: are you sorry now? ROMNEY MARSH. “Why, here's the roofs of Romney Marsh— And yon's old Peter Jervis, Just tossing off his final pint Before the evening service! “And there's my Susan's gable, too— But, ere I turn to wooing, I think I'll dip my dusty beard In some of Romney's brewing: “It's worth a moment, even now, To wait, like old Ulysses, And fit my garb for Susan's arms, My lips for Susan's kisses. “So, Landlord, draw the spigot forth, And tell your wife and daughter There's none so sweet as Romney ale, So cool as Romney water. “And, landlord, how's the world with you? Since I went out to wander, There's mighty changes, I'll be bound, Through all the village yonder; “So set the frosted pewter down, And, that we may not waste it, Let's hear what healths are still to drink, Before we stoop to taste it. “There's first the men—from Parson Brown To Sam the floury baker— And then the girls; and best of all, There's bonny Susan Dacre: “I saw her window as I came, But all the room discloses Is just a gap of dark, between The jasmine and the roses: “She's all my own, so never mind How good she is and clever; But, are her lips as ruddy still, Her eyes as bright, as ever?” John Landlord was a roughish man: Says he, “Come, drain the tankard— You want to take your news aboard Before you're fairly anchor'd! “But look now, toward the chancel door, This side—you ought to know it— The red light through your father's shield Is quite enough to show it; “She used to call that shelter'd spot The best in all God's Acre: And there the young grass grows apace Above sweet Susan Dacre!” “Thanks, friends—you see me sound and well: And now the fit is over, Don't take me for a foolish maid That mourns her parted lover! “Believe me, 'twas but some strange qualm Set all my brain a-ringing, To hear once more the evening psalm Those folks in church are singing. “So fill the tankard, boys, again— Though I've no chance to wake her, At least I'll drink my pot of beer Beside poor Susan Dacre; “And when the Parson's had his say, I'll seek old Peter Jervis, And bring him back to sup with me On scandal, after service.” The prayers are done, and Romney lane With village folk is crowded; And here's old Peter all alone! “Why, man, the moon's unclouded— “You couldn't miss him on the road? Or has he slipp'd behind you? Or did you leave him in the porch, To seek and never find you?” “Find me?” says Peter. “Listen here: While Parson said the blessing, I thought, I'll wait till all be gone, And give my graves a dressing. “So, when I'd finish'd widow Moore's, And smooth'd old Sam the baker's, I went to have one parting look At bonny Susan Dacre's: “And, bless us, what a tale was there, If one had wit to win it! His corpse lay spread on Susan's grave, As cold as hers within it! “Poor soul! among the trampled grass His pipe and pot were lying; And worse than all—he'd drain'd the beer Before he took to dying. “Well, well! He died for love of her, So we've no call to chide him: But Lord, to think the good brown ale Should go to earth inside him!” SEAMER MERE. Her path was by the grassy ledge, And downward to the mere That steeps in baths of watery sedge The feet of Oliver. There, when the nights were soft and still, The great red moon above Rose o'er the shoulder of the hill, And made the fir-trees move With moving light, till through the brake A path was made for her To plunge into the misty lake, A new Excalibur. Then through the green unfooted glen Bright silence did prevail, Unvext with cries of beasts and men Or song of nightingale. The ouzel slept upon her nest, The lizard in the fern; And 'mid the shallows stood at rest The solitary hern: And if along the grey hill-tops Some nimble shadows fly, 'Tis but the conies of the copse Are feeding silently. 'Twas there, 'twas thus, we used to meet And talk in whispers grave, Mix'd with the murmur at our feet And with the far sea-wave. I think she must have been as fair As then she seem'd to be: Why is it, that her eyes and hair Are nothing now to me? For then, her lips were always red, Her eyes did always shine; Her hand—I loved it, though she said It was not white like mine. I seem to see her as she stands— And all her golden head Glows in the moonlight, with cool bands Of darkness compassed. We have not met, indeed, for years; Yet, do whate'er I will, The pathos of her artless tears Works strangely in me still. But we submit; a man may learn To mix with camomile The ashes in his mother's urn, And drink them with a smile. Yet sure, 'twas cruel to come here: I did what man could do— I show'd we might have balls elsewhere; My lady answer'd, “No.” And in that valley, as we came, Unconsciously I heard Some scoundrel call the station's name, And Seamer was the word. Seamer! I started in a fright And woke my languid spouse: 'Twas well for me I did not quite Forget my marriage-vows! Still, I look'd out: the station stands Where those green ledges were; The line runs through those marshy lands— Of course they've drain'd the mere. Well, well, no doubt we live and learn; So, with one meek caress, I leave my lady at the urn, And go upstairs to dress. Why, what is this infernal print In which they've wrapp'd my shoes? Can Brown have had a secret hint, And want to break the news? News! nay, the paper's old and stain'd, The type is blurr'd and brown— “They found them when the mere was drain'd, A mile above the town; “The mother's corpse was young and fair, Her babe's was lying near: They knew her by her golden hair— The lass of Seamer Mere.” Good God! I'll fly this very day— I'll ask them if they don't Want brethren at La Trappe—but stay: On second thoughts, I won't. Why should I? What would be the use? She's gone where all must go— I wish that Brown was at the deuce, And I shall tell him so! CASQUE AND PLUME. In the old churchyard of the Temple Church,— Where a man would vainly seek and search Through the gross and grimy gloom Of a hazy oozy autumn day For a place to stow his body away, For an inch of burying-room,— There lie, in under the wall of the Round, Where the green grass mantles the human ground, Six ancient quarried tombs: We found them only the other day, When we clear'd that dingy house away, Beneath its basement rooms. Now who, do you think, were the mighty ones Who have left therein a few old bones And a pinch of crumbled clay? The lawyer's-clerk, as he trips downstairs With his bulky bag and his business airs, Says he really cannot say. William the Earl hath his tomb within, And the Baron de Ros with his beardless chin, And Geoffrey de Magnaville: From the days that follow'd Heraclius Their mailed figures have rested thus, And thus they are resting still. But which of the knights are these out here? Is it Valaincourt, or the tall De Vere, That we do so forget? Which of the knights who fought and pray'd, And were smitten at last, but were not affray'd, By the grim Plantagenet? Nothing is left of them now to tell How they fared or how they fell, Or how they came to be here; Nobody now shall ever know, From the heavens above or the earth below, What manner of men they were. And therefore I think that lawyer's-clerk, Who snatches his dinner amidst his work, Deserves more praise than blame: His visible edible plate of beef Is more than a saint who has come to grief, Or a hero without a name. And so if you eat at the Cheshire Cheese, Or strive and struggle to take your ease In that dim antique resort Where the plump head-waiter has brought up sons, And the chops and steaks have perish'd by tons, Since Tennyson tapp'd his port,— You'll feel, I'm sure, as you come away, That the knowledge that served you best that day Was the knowledge of how to dine; That the men of old, and their thoughts and deeds, Were not to be named with a choice of weeds, And an accurate taste in wine. “What!” says the poet, “the glorious dead, Who have left us their grace and their bountihead, And their carven creed withal; Whose presence among us can never die— No, not with the death of chivalry— Are these, then, nothing at all?” Soyez tranquille, my ardent friend; Nature herself to your views must lend A sigh of sympathy: But the men are gone, and their creed—ahem!— If you really don't think that it died with them, Why, go into church and see. And yet, here is one thing not forlorn, Not yet destroy'd by the creatures born Of Time's incessant womb: 'Tis a thing that lies in this very churchyard; That lies with its face turn'd heavenward; 'Tis Oliver Goldsmith's tomb. Oliver! he and his work, for one, Though his heart be dust and his head but bone, Are neither dark nor dim: The long-drawn after-light, that clears The cloudy verge of our resonant years, For ever shines on him. How could himself but keep renown, When the souls that he fashion'd out of his own Have gotten a place and name, And a power, greater than yours or mine, And a memory larger and more divine Than the best of our living fame? Why, to the bustling lawyer's-clerk, Who snatches his knowledge amidst his work, This grave is known and dear; And the Vicar of Wakefield's love and grief Are better to him than his plate of beef, Or even his pint of beer. And thus, if a man will seek and search Within and without the Temple Church, This truth to his heart may come: That more than the Templars lying there, And more than the Round, though it be so fair, Is Oliver Goldsmith's tomb. FIVE-AND-THIRTY. George Lambert, you have woo'd me long; You singled me from out the throng By every sleight of speech and song, To make me yours. I cannot tell why you should care To win me; for I am not fair; My bloom is not so fresh, my hair So bright, as yours. And truly, when at first I saw Your eyes were on me, and the law Magnetic had begun to draw My own on yours, I found therein no lordly grace To make a grown-up woman place Her love on such a boyish face As this of yours. 'Tis said in sadness, not in blame; For women who are worth the name Love more the wrinkled mouth of fame Than lips like yours. And even I, though I could see That, when you sang, you sang of me, Was never touch'd as girls would be By songs of yours, Till once, with too melodious breath, You told how great Elizabeth, Or such as she, had done to death Young hearts like yours. Then, I remember, in the pause, When faces brightening with applause Of which I only knew the cause Were turn'd on yours, I only silent sat, and thought: I wonder'd if this thrill were nought, Or if indeed my presence wrought High change in yours. For, with that song, the light I prize Had come at last into your eyes, And I could think them deep and wise, Though they were yours! So, when you met me otherwhere And said the words that needless were After so sweet a prelude, there You thought me yours. 'Tis true, I said a woman's No, And spoke of ages, and the slow Still-widening fissure that would grow 'Twixt mine and yours; But you, with that keen ear of youth, That instinct of respectful ruth For women, had perceived the truth, And crown'd me yours. Ah, shall I tell you how it was? I am not all so feeble as A girl whose yielding soul might pass Straight into yours; I weigh'd and ponder'd what I did: Our hearts would not be always hid, And there's a vein in mine, would thrid The depths of yours, And with its iron bind the clay— The white unmoulded mass, that may (I thought) become to mine a stay, As mine to yours. For, though my years are nigh the full, And though a drooping lid may dull In me the gleams that gazers cull From eyes like yours; Yet, being a woman, I am weak Toward beauty, and the nurture meek Whose symbols are a brow and cheek As clear as yours. Therefore, as some stern man, whose prime Has caught the roughness and the rime Wherewith a long tempestuous time Would crust e'en yours, Wears on his bosom, like a rose, The wife whose childlike fondness shows To him more charming than she knows— So I wore yours. You and your love, I thought, would be The glad revival unto me Of that serene simplicity Once mine, now yours: And I would build you up to all The height of things heroical, My stronger nature as a wall Confirming yours; Till you, half-feminine though brave, And I, though worn, yet true and grave, Would fit at last like hand and glaive— And both be yours. George Lambert, what a dream was this! I wake to old analysis, And question every smile and kiss Of mine or yours, And feel upon me such a stress Of sad mature self-consciousness, That I no more have heart to bless This suit of yours. George, what was that of “like to like?” It seems to me that, as a shrike Wounds callow birds, my lips must strike The warmth of yours. You want a life of richer tone; A heart full-blooded as your own Should loose its ample maiden-zone To take in yours: But I—I am too lean for love; The day is past when I could move With equal aspect, arm inwove In arm of yours: Too many sober thoughts attend My age—how joy may have an end, But sorrow never: could I blend Such thoughts with yours? Old scenes you cannot understand, Old lives, are ever with me; and, Perhaps, old memories of a hand That was not yours. “I should have seen all this before?” I did; but winds of pride outbore My craft, that should have hugg'd the shore, To follow yours. Forgive me then the words I've said; If I had known its youth was dead I would have crush'd my heart, instead Of cleaving yours. Forgive me: I am cold, but what Have I to do with life? My lot May make me yet a Bride; but not— Alas! not yours. DORIS. A PASTORAL. I sat with Doris, the shepherd-maiden; Her crook was laden with wreathed flowers; I sat and woo'd her, through sunlight wheeling, And shadows stealing, for hours and hours. And she, my Doris, whose lap encloses Wild summer-roses of faint perfume, The while I sued her, kept hush'd and hearken'd, Till shades had darken'd from gloss to gloom. She touch'd my shoulder with fearful finger; She said, “We linger, we must not stay: My flock's in danger, my sheep will wander; Behold them yonder, how far they stray!” I answer'd bolder, “Nay, let me hear you, And still be near you, and still adore! No wolf nor stranger will touch one yearling— Ah! stay, my dearling, a moment more!” She whisper'd, sighing, “There will be sorrow Beyond to-morrow, if I lose to-day; My fold unguarded, my flock unfolded— I shall be scolded and sent away!” Said I, denying, “If they do miss you, They ought to kiss you when you get home; And well rewarded by friend and neighbour Should be the labour from which you come.” “They might remember,” she answer'd meekly, “That lambs are weakly, and sheep are wild; But if they love me, it's none so fervent— I am a servant, and not a child.” Then each hot ember glow'd quick within me, And love did win me to swift reply: “Ah! do but prove me, and none shall bind you, Nor fray nor find you, until I die!” She blush'd and started, and stood awaiting, As if debating in dreams divine: But I did brave them—I told her plainly She doubted vainly, she must be mine. So we, twin-hearted, from all the valley Did rouse and rally her nibbling ewes, And homeward drave them, we two together, Through blooming heather and gleaming dews. That simple duty fresh grace did lend her, My Doris tender, my Doris true; That I, her warder, did alway bless her, And often press her to take her due: And now in beauty she fills my dwelling With love excelling, and undefiled; And love doth guard her, both fast and fervent, No more a servant, nor yet a child. A HUSBAND'S EPISODES. I heard a note in my garden bower; A note of cooing, and kisses of love. My fair young wife was abroad at that hour: I saw the cedar branches move, And two shadows, one of a man, Certainly pass'd across the lawn Into the place where our kisses began, When the chamber was still and the curtains drawn. At last I said, when the morning came, And she was as sleek as a sunning dove, “Shall we go forth, my dainty dame, From the jonquil-nests and the cedar grove, “And seek the open air of the sea, Where the blue waves gallop against the shore Just as the heart of a man, set free, Bounds toward the steadfast things of yore?” We went; for she did not spy my drift: She only saw, that down by the sea There would be many a change and shift, And many a chance of escape from me. But I was 'ware of a certain walk, Close to the edge of the cliffs so tall, Where ledges and lumps of the crafty chalk Break off to the deep, that swallows them all. We walk'd there once, and not in vain; For ever so long it had not slid, But the rock was loosen'd now by rain, And I thought it would slide that day. It did. So she went down with it into the foam; And, the crowner's 'quest absolving me, I turn'd (with crape on my hat) toward home, And waited awhile till the end should be. I had not long to wait for him: He came, with malice shut up in his eyes, With his tongue so trite, and his smile so trim, And gave me comfort, and gave me sighs: But, when I went with him back to the train— Just as a friend should do, you know— We talk'd the sad tale over again; And, whether I let his damp hand go A little too sharply, who can tell? But down, with a ghastly groan and grim, Under the griding wheels he fell; And the train went over him, limb by limb. As I drove home that glorious night, I did not laugh; for you see, my groom Was sitting behind with his face so white; And he could tell tales to the housemaids' room. But I gave my leader the lightest touch Of a whip that would hardly bear control, And I whistled a few sweet bars—not much— Of the merry tune that fill'd my soul. Ah well! The work of my life is done: But I should be rather glad, d'ye know, To get away from the shining sun, And hide my triumph beneath my woe.</field>

Ther's summat worrkin' i' thah mahnd, Ah knaw: Speeak oop, me lass, an' tell auld Philip all!” Then she, with grave affection in her eyes, Toss'd back her batter'd bonnet and her hair, And look'd at him; who saw her wan face rise Again to beauty, sorrow being there. “Aye, Philip, them was happy daas, indeed! Ah mahnd 'em well: sich bonny crops as yon Oor maaster ow'd, Ah seer Ah niver seed I't sooth; an' him a joggin' oot upon “His gallowaa, te watch us all agaat— Me, an' oor Jaan, an' Jack (wat's getten Jack?)

Now lithe and listen, ladies, if you please; Here are the words of Hannah Cullender, A maid-of-all-work. You that sit at ease, You don't see much that's beautiful in her, Who never sits at all, except at meals, And then so awkwardly. You know, her face Is coarse and homely, and from head to heels, Through all her clumsy frame, the lines of grace Are shockingly distorted. If her hand Be placed against your own, you needn't grudge The pain of touching it; you'll understand, Just by the look, that she's a very drudge, A mere hard-working servant. Well! and yet, I say again, you laughing light-o'-loves, Before you clasp the last new carcanet About your arm, or fit your last new gloves, Listen to Hannah. This is what she said, Once on a time, when she had holiday, And, for a wonder, left off earning bread To go a-pleasuring. She was as gay, All by herself, as if she'd had, like you, Duenna, flaming footmen, cavalier; Her tastes being humble, and her fetters few, She walk'd about, and gazed, and drank her beer, And chatted, too, with strangers; for, you see, One must have folks to talk to, and the girl Has not a friend in all the town but me, That was her mistress once. Perhaps the whirl Of London life had got into her brain; But this is what she said to me; and mind, She said it meekly. I had tried in vain To warn her of the men: “You're very kind; But, ma'am,” she said, “although it's fifteen year I've been in service, if you come to age, I doubt I'm younger than my missis were When she were married. It's the taking wage, And doing work, and bothering, that tells, And makes one coarse. But still, it makes us strong, And very good at fending for oursels; And that's the main thing, too. It's not so long Since Miss Jemima, that was wed last spring, First courted with the brewer; and, my word! But they was free to court, like anything: Why, things was left o' purpose, as I heard, For them to meet, and get acquaint, and be Match'd, like, and so have done with it. But what! When Jim and me was keeping company, My missis play'd a different game to that: 'Twas, ‘Oh, no! There's no followers allow'd In this house.’ So my Jim, next time he come, I show'd him my charackter (I was proud, And so was he), and, ‘Jim,’ I says, ‘go home; We've been a-courting now this goodish while, And here's the end o't; for I can't afford,’ I says (and then I made-believe to smile), ‘I can't afford to lose my place.’ My word! It went again me; he did look so smart And nice, and were a tidy chap, you see, As could be: still, I settled we must part, And part we did. But, ma'am, I think 'twould be A rare good job, to let a servant maid Live honest, then, and have her sweethearts free, Like ladies have; and not be so afraid, And run out sneaking to the area-gate, And whispering on the sly. There's many a lass Takes up with lads and finds 'em out too late, For want of leave to know 'em. It do pass My wits, to reckon what a man is like, When he just meets you, maybe, on a spree, Or brings the milk, and that. There's Bickerdike Our butcher; bless you, ma'am, he bothers me Week after week, with every joint of meat, To have him: have him? Why, I canna tell, No more than you can, if he means deceit, With seeing him a that way. He might well Be on with other girls, all unbeknown, One to a street, or better. But to come Right open and above-board, and sit down, And show hisself, and tell what sort of home He'd give a wife, and say out, like a man, Before our master, what he say to me; Why, then it would be different.” I began To find this babble tedious. Generally One thinks of servants as a race who live By labour and new bonnets; and, indeed, How could our households be at peace and thrive, If they had sweethearts too? So, there was need To warn our Hannah against courting. Still— These lonely maidens, fretting in their dens Against each other, full of foolish will, Forlorn of nobler women's and of men's Companionship and counsel—after all, Perhaps there may be found within their souls Some frozen germ that represents in small The full-grown love which fashions and controls The hearts of us fair ladies.—Well: if so, I think we ought to cherish it, you know. THE SERVING MAID. When you go out at early morn, Your busy hands, sweet drudge, are bare; For you must work, and none are there To see with scorn—to feel with scorn. And when the weekly wars begin, Your arms are naked to the hilt, And many a sturdy pail's a-tilt To sheathe them in—to plunge them in. For you at least can understand That daily work is hard and stern, That those who toil for bread must learn To bare the hand—to spoil the hand. But in the evening, when they dine, And you behind each frequent chair Are flitting lightly here and there To bring them wine—to pour them wine; Oh then, from every dainty eye That may not so be shock'd or grieved, Your hands are hid, your arms are sleeved: We ask not why—we tell not why. Ah fools! Though you for workday scours, And they for show, unveil their charms, Love is not bound to snowy arms, He thinks of yours—he speaks of yours: To me his weighted shaft has come; Though hand and arm are both unseen, Your rosy wrist peeps out between And sends it home—and speeds it home. MAID MARGERY. They say, you are so mean and low; Your gown is but a cotton print; You wear a cap, that hides your hair; You are too homely to be fair— Maid Margery! No doubt, 'tis work has made you so— “And Nature too,” they harshly hint: Scant schooling snatch'd in bluecoat days, Could that refine your rustic ways, Maid Margery? Your hand, they say, is large; they trace Broad lines of labour on the palm; And if a hand be thus, of course A ring of gold but makes it worse, Maid Margery! Then, they see nowhere in your face That affable self-conscious calm Which, when some earnest soul is bared, Cares not—but looks as if it cared, Maid Margery. Why, if a joy should wreathe your mouth, A sorrow press your moisten'd eyes, Would you be thinking all the while 'Twas àpropos, to weep or smile, Maid Margery? Not you! You are too coarse a growth: Nay more; whatever thoughts arise, You speak them out to all and each Quite plainly, and in Saxon speech, Maid Margery. Alas, such frankness is a part Of truth's unpalatable wine, Which we may neither pour nor taste Whose very lives are double-faced, Maid Margery. “Unletter'd mind, unlovely heart, A soulless drudge, a pearl-fed swine, Who cannot understand a word Of all the mots she ever heard!” Maid Margery, 'Tis thus they speak of you: you lack The reticence of comme-il-faut, The skill to meet opposing wits; You, a mere girl that sits and knits— Maid Margery! Knits? If they saw you with bent back, Down on your knees, and working so? And yet there's wiser maids than you Have thought no shame of stooping, too, Maid Margery. Besides—but you have done the floor, So I'll be brief: I don't suppose That, after all, you'd care to see One half they've said of you to me, Maid Margery! Well, poor men's sweethearts should be poor: Since you and I must work, who knows But we might work together; I The brain, and you the hand and eye, Maid Margery? MARY ANN. She is right weary of her days, Her long lone days of dusty kneeling; And yet “the thoughts o' you,” she says, “Has took away my tired feeling.” “For when I've done the room,” she says, “And clean'd it all from floor to ceiling, A-leaning on my broom,” she says, “I do have such a tired feeling!” But he, the other labourer, Has left behind his moorland shieling, And comes at last to comfort her, Because he knows her tired feeling. “I know'd you was to come,” she says, “For why? I see'd the swallows wheeling; And that's a sign to me, I says, I soon shall lose my tired feeling. “I'll ax my Missis leave, I says; I canna work; my heart wants healing: She give it me, and smiles and says ‘Well, that'll cure your tired feeling.’ “And so it will! For days and days I'm strong again, and fit for kneeling: The thoughts o' seeing you,” she says, “Has took away my tired feeling.” AT SEMPACH. Fields, where the tillage is not wholly man's— Wherein the sturdy mower whets her scythe And the plough-maiden drives her languid team O'er purple slopes, with many a fair-hair'd gang Of girls that ply the mattock and the hoe, Or blithely move beneath such wondrous loads As unaccustom'd manhood may not bear; Such fields, such valleys, the stupendous Alps, Strong virgins of the desert, well may guard, And freedom bless with rare tranquillity. For these are women of heroic type, The mothers of unconquerable men: They are no timid darlings, who delight To ape the unmeaning fashions of the rich, Or, rich themselves, to frolic life away; But in serene equality of strength, And unobtrusive and laborious love That helps abroad and cherishes at home, They dwell beside their husbands and their sires, And please, because they know not they are fair: Soil'd on the surface, haply (if the touch Of honest earth, and such delicious hues As sunshine gives, and health, be stains indeed), But in themselves, as pure as the blue heart Of those deep glaciers, broadening from on high, That glide and glide, until they melt below In streams that charm with music all the dale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WOMAN'S RIGHTS. One must take the rough with the smooth. Nec crimen duras esset habere manus. Some say, that women should be weak; That sunburnt throat and roughen'd cheek Are wholly out of place For that sweet sex, whose duty lies In having lovely lips and eyes, And attitudes all grace. And some, with difference, are agreed That women should be weak, indeed, Of body and of limb; But, en revanche, in brain and mind They may and ought to be a kind Of stronger seraphim. Weak? cries another; why, they are! No talk of ‘should be:’ you're aware That much diversity Of ways, of frame, and, in a word, Of nature, makes it quite absurd For them to work as we. “Of course!” says one; “it's not our trade: Our little hands were never made To wipe another's dust; So here's the formula I use: ‘Let women work because they choose, And men because they must.’ “That is, at handiwork. But brains! I shall not waste (says she) much pains To prove and prove again That women needn't stay at home To use them; they may go and come, A better sort of men, “At mart and meeting, church and bar: Wherever fame and fortune are There I (she says) believe That woman shortly will resort; Till every Adam finds in court An opposition Eve.” Alas, my lively learned friends! This child but feebly comprehends The meaning of it all: What with your speeches and your sections, Your arguments and grave objections, Your—well, I won't say gall; Your pamphlets, letters to the Times, Smart magazines, and ready rhymes On everything but love; And papers too by high-soul'd men, Whose bosoms bleed for Lydia, when She soils her dainty glove; I tell you, what with this and that, We plain ones can't think what you're at; Indeed we really can't: And therefore, in the name of sense, Eschew negation and pretence, And say the thing you want! Look here: you strive, and nobly too, To find employment for that crew Of hapless imbeciles (Excuse the word) whose lot in life Lies 'twixt the needle and the knife, Unless they sell their smiles: You trust them with a watch's works; You make them prentices and clerks; Put pens behind their ears; Or bid them tell the feeling cords, In vivid music of dumb words, Our triumphs and our fears: 'Tis new; but who will interfere? For me, I trust that every year Your telegraphic maids, Your girls who copy briefs and wills Or set up circulars and bills, May flourish in their trades. Et puis, mesdames? These quiet duties May do for sedentary beauties; But, you yourselves must own, All women don't like sitting still; All are not competent to fill A clerkly seat in town. Some lasses, neither slim nor fair, Live mostly in the open air, And rather like it, too: Their faces and their hands are brown; Their fists, perchance, might knock you down, If they were minded to! What say you then of such as these? May they continue, if they please, To swing the pail, to scrub, To make the cheese, to warm the cruds, And lash the storm of steaming suds Within the washing-tub? “Well, yes,” say you; “undoubtedly: We meddle not with them; you see Our business is with wrong: We wish to set the balance straight, And somewhat equalize in fate The feeble and the strong. “We seek the middle classes' good: Their overflowing womanhood Exactly suits our plan; Which is, to prove the latent might Of women, and assert their right To work abreast of man.” Good: and a blessing on the deed! Since then you're anxious to succeed, I gladly make it known That Nature, in her wiser hours, Has seconded this plan of yours By teachings of her own. “Whene'er you take your walks abroad,” You'll haply see along the road, In field, or yard, or farm, Those girls of whom I spoke just now: You'll see them lift a sweating brow, Or bare a rough red arm Right up through all its brawny length; And do with ease such feats of strength As make you ladies stare; Or, pausing in their toil, they'll stand And hold you out a harden'd hand, And ask you how you are. Is it not comfort, then, to know These wenches have such thews to show, And work with such a will? What health there is in every face! And, if with a Herculean grace, Are they not graceful still? “Oh no!” you scream, “good gracious, no! You wicked man! How dare you so Distort our publish'd views? We hate what is unfeminine; We can't see anything divine In muscles or in thews! “Hard hands! and oh, a dirty face! What sad indelible disgrace For this soft sex of ours! We want them to be nice and clean; With tasteful dress and gentle mien, Like nymphs among the flowers! “If those poor souls are so degraded They fancy they can work, unaided By our wise counsellings, We must, we really must, present And pass a Bill through Parliament To stop such dreadful things! “Why were they never, never taught To scorn their labour as they ought, And feel that it is wrong Thus to use strength and gain by it? It doesn't signify one bit That they are well and strong: “We're bound to show them what they want; To say they mustn't and they shan't Destroy their fair complexions By doing work that men should do: Great, big, ungrateful men like you, Who raise these weak objections!” I raise objections? Nay, my dears: 'Tis true, I've watch'd their work for years With no unfriendly eye; Because, alas! in every point My facts are somewhat out of joint With half your theory. But now, you see, you're caught at last: Women, whose powers are so vast, Are children, after all! They mustn't give, as men may give, Their sweat and brains, nor freely live In great things and in small: They must be guided from above, By quips of patronizing love, To do or not to do: Though they be made of stalwart stuff, Buxom and brave and stout enough, And full of spirit too, Yet they may never seek, forsooth, To enterprize their lusty youth In labours or commands Which, while they leave unfetter'd course To native energy and force, Might spoil their pretty hands! “Nay, spoil their woman's heart,” say you. What! Then you think it isn't true That every woman dims The moon-like lustre of her kind As much by manliness of mind As manliness of limbs? Or else—and this is what you mean— You simply seek a grander scene, A more sublime display, For female talents of the brain: You strive (I hope 'tis not in vain) To find your sex a way To share our honours and our fame— The civic or forensic name On which your fancy lingers; But, when it comes to rough hard work, You will not help us with a fork— Much less with your white fingers. There is a game that schoolboys use, Called ‘Heads I win, and tails you lose;’ And this smart game of shares, Wherein we men are to be drudges, And you both élégantes and Judges, Seems very much like theirs. Why don't you drop it, and be frank? For our part, we must say point-blank, With much respectful moan, That we'll oppose you tooth and nail, Unless you'll swallow all the whale, Or let the beast alone. Either agree, you stand apart, As much by nature as by art, In power of the mind— In grasp of knowledge—in the right Of work—in such inferior might As differs kind from kind; Either confess (and Truth forbid We should allow it, if you did) That you are born to serve: Slight creatures, only fit to stand The smaller tasks of head and hand: Weaklings in every nerve: Or else, take heart of grace, and say, “You men, we'll meet you any day On all the field of life; Save only to our bounded sex The matron care that guards and checks A mother, or a wife.” Since there is work for all and each, Rough or refined in frame and speech, Rudely or gently nurst,— Take it; and if you need defence, Cry, Honi soit qui mal y pense, And let them think their worst. But don't come forth, with hand on hip And such grand airs of championship To battle for your right, And then turn round on half your troops With these terrific howls and whoops, Because they love to fight In ways less ladylike than yours: Don't say your Amazons are boors, And mustn't seek to ride, Because, when they have tighten'd girth, Like half the women of the earth They choose to mount astride. Don't practise, in your noble rage, To stint an honest maiden's wage And dwarf her vigour too, Whene'er her daily labours fall 'Mid scenes which you think bad for all, Because they startle you. Weaklings, indeed! Yon stunted girl Who minds the bobbins as they twirl Or plies the flashing loom, She is a weakling, if you will: And yet, because she works on still Shut up inside a room, You let her work; you don't pretend That that degrades her in the end: But, if she dares to go And brace her muscles in the fields, Till with a sinewy arm she wields The hayfork or the hoe, Straight you lift up your prudish eyes, Affect a feminine surprise, And do your best to spoil The hearty health, the bluff content, That Nature's righteous self hath sent To bless her sunburnt toil! Weaklings? I chanced to be of late Where young Tom Prentiss and his mate Were working side by side: Who was his mate? A woman, dears! A lass whom he has loved for years; His sweetheart, Ellen Hyde. Ah, Ellen is a girl to see; She has not sacrificed—not she— Her massive breadth of limb: If any lad less kind and good Than Tom, should happen to be rude, She'd make short work of him! Yet with her strength she is most fair; Fairest of all the women there, When summer morns are rathe She seeks her labour, and her large Lithe form is hail'd by every barge That lies along the staith. Save the red beads about her neck (Tom's gift) her beauty has no speck Of gawds and coquetries: Her bonnet tilted o'er her brow Is set there, not to guard its snow, But just to shade her eyes. Beneath a sleeveless vest of say Her ample shoulders freely play, Her bosom beats at ease; And, veil'd by half her kilted gown, The lindsey kirtle loiters down Not far below her knees. Her hosen? Yes, their warm grey strands Were knitted by her own true hands Beside the cottage fire; And ankle-boots of size and weight, Nail-studded, shoed with iron plate, Complete her brave attire. Thus have I seen her ply her trade, With Tom at hand to cheer and aid— Though aid she needed none: Who should compare her frame with his Might fairly doubt, if that or this Could better work alone: And sometimes, when a pause was made, Leaning on pickaxe or on spade She smiled and whisper'd low, Whilst, with long labour grown too warm, She drew her firm and freckled arm Across her beaded brow. Thus too, within her mother's home I've seen her frankly go and come— So bonny, and so tall; And seen her sleek her chestnut hair, And mend her things of workday wear, And smooth her Sunday shawl, And sew, in hope of leisure hours, Her bonnet with the wee bit flowers That Tom would most approve; And in her broken looking-glass Behold unmoved as sweet a lass As man could wish to love. Ah Virtue, what a sight was here! A sight for those to whom is dear The substance, not the show: A woman strong to dare and do, Yet soft towards suffering, and true In welfare and in woe: Whose woman's nature is not lost, Nor marr'd, nor even tempest-tost, But strengthen'd and controll'd: Who, working thus with sinewy hands, Grows deaf to Folly's fond commands, Grows calm and solemn-soul'd. Yes, ladies of the Yankee creed, We scruple not to see you bleed— With lancets—if you will, Or show the pulpit and the bar How worthy of ourselves you are In subtlety and skill; But, leave your stronger mates alone: They, tense of thews and stout of bone, Rejoice to work amain; And so they shall, in breadth and length: As free to use their woman's strength As you your woman's brain. AULD LANG SYNE. So, here we are! and this, my dear, Is all that's left of Seamer Mere. But yon green hill, where legends say That Cromwell's cannon used to play Across a mile or two of sea, As Armstrong's do at Shoebury,— Yon crested Mount, has felt no loss; But, like its great Eponymos, Stands firm and founded in its fame— Serene, and sombre, and the same. Ah? what is that rude thing up there— That whited shed? I do declare It is some place where one may sit, Smile at the sea, and say of it “'Tis not so bad!” or, if he choose, Enlarge and modify his views Of all around, by drinking clear And foamy draughts of bitter beer, Drawn fresh, no doubt, for him (or her) From the grave brows of Oliver. Do you remember, Rosa dear, The days when we came jaunting here— Long, long, before these rails were down,— In that old carriage of our own; That chariot, built with antique art In the great times of Buonaparte, And rocking on its lofty springs As lightly as the thrones of Kings? O'er its gay panels, as we rode, Mamma's heraldic lozenge glow'd; The round imperial on the roof Kept her stiff dresses waterproof; And Jane so fair and Ben so kind, High perch'd above the wheels behind, Guarded the sword-case, amply stored With vast umbrella, and with cane The sordid offspring of the sword. Ah, had we leave to see again Jane's bonnet of forgotten shape And Ben's departed coat and cape, They would not seem more strange, I trow, Than We of then to Us of now! 'Twas thus of old we used to roam, In annual splendour, from our home; Nor unannounced; for on before The chaise had whirl'd our little store Of country cream, and country maids Who gossipp'd with the rural blades, While Taffy, trotting loose beside, With no one but himself to guide, Had room enough to prance and toss— A puny pert ?????????? We too, with posters à la mode, Bowl'd brisk along the broad high road; And sped beyond the level plain, And up the hills, and down again; Pleased with the fragrant air of morn, And flatter'd by the frequent horn Of coaching-teams, that could not bear To lag behind our modest pair. How fast we flew! yet not too fast To scan the country as we pass'd: For those were times when screech and groan And harrowing whistle were unknown; And we had leisure and to spare; And knew right well, that howsoe'er Our Jehu's rapid buckskins rose, We still could stop him when we chose. And stop we did; on Whitwell Hill The stout old horses quaff'd their fill; And rustic dames and ostlers came To greet us too in Yedingham; And at the Talbot (which, you know, Was closed and ruin'd long ago) We halved the golden summer day With dinner, and with childish play Along the terrace and the lawn. Green glow'd that terrace, smoothly drawn Toward the vinery, that stood Right over Derwent's glistening flood, And saw him glide to left and right, And saw him curving out of sight In under Kirkham woods, that gaze On ruins of yet older days. So evermore, by upland folds Of hills that look upon the Wolds As they look out on Holderness, We watch'd the noonday light grow less, And chased in fancy hour by hour The flying gleam, the fitful shower; And met, perchance (O joy of joys To growing girls and gaping boys!) In Brompton or in Wykeham vale, The redcoats of the Royal Mail; And sniff'd the breezes, to divine When first they savour'd of the brine; And, climbing up the final steep, Caught far-off glimpses of the keep Of yon old castle, and the brown Warm gables of the ancient town; And thus at last beheld the sea, The blue bright world of liberty. Ah, surely, Rosa, you and I Have lived at least a century Since we forsook—and not in tears— Those misappreciated years; Which seem (and judgement leaves uncheck'd The force of memory's retrospect) Compared with these, which seem and were So leisurely, so debonair. Such quiet times, my love, as those The waken'd world no longer knows; Nor shall know, till this deepening strife Of thought with matter, time with life, Wins for mankind, in some far age, That blest Utopia of the sage— Fruition, and such sweet content As is both wise and innocent. Why, look upon this alter'd scene! The castle dykes, 'tis true, are green With the thick sward of centuries; But here, to our old-fashion'd eyes, The ruddy roofs, the mellow brown Of all this snug old fishing-town Are lost, and merged, and swallow'd up Like Folly's pearl in Folly's cup In one intoxicating glow Of modern gaiety and show. For miles and miles of precious ground, O'er hill, in vale, above, around, The builder works his witless will, And perpetrates with feeble skill All that most deadens and degrades The noblest of men's noble trades— The godlike craft of masonry. But no—not all: although his eye Ten thousand follies seems to try, The stone that lies upon the shore Has saved him from ten thousand more: And who are we, to be severe On him who daubs and dabbles here, We, who know well that Beauty died When Love was banish'd from her side? See, too, how vast the daily throng Who listless lounge and loiter long Upon the terrace of the Spa With beau or brother or Mamma, And in the pauses of the band Shed smiles or frowns on either hand, As though the world that struts and stares Had eyes for no sweet self but theirs! In wondrous breeks the men are dight; In wondrous hats the maids delight; Their gowns so plump and pendulous, That please themselves and frighten us, Go up and down and to and fro Rotating ever as they go, And bell-like say, in all but words, “Fine feathers make the finest birds.” How changed from what you used to wear! That trim ravissant bonnet, dear, That simple—but I must not tell What was the dress I loved so well, Lest some should hear me speak, and see How old you are to all but me: Why, all these seaward walks, so bright With clothes by day, with gas by night, Shine on my puzzled brain as if The hanging gardens of the cliff Were painted scenes confused with whirls Of opera nymphs and ballet girls! What can these crowded strangers care For summer skies or ocean air, Or aught, indeed, but just to say That they have ‘shown themselves’ to-day? What can they of each other know, Whom chilling looks and thoughts of spite Forbid that they should know aright? How can they feel the hearty glow That we felt, when we drove of yore By the wet margin of the shore— So close, the spread wave in its course Wash'd the white fetlocks of the horse— And met our friends, and gave to each Frank greeting or familiar speech; And knew, rejoicing that we knew, The place select, the people few? Select? That look of soft appeal Was scarcely needed to reveal The pride, the follies, I have heard Unkennell'd by that pompous word! You say (and sure your instincts bring Excuse for almost everything), The Railway plays a noble part, Bearing from factory and mart Its thousands of laborious men Who else might work with hand or pen From year to year, and never see What some behold so thoughtlessly: True, love! 'Twere selfish and unwise To keep fair sights for wealthy eyes; The sweet instruction and the grace Of Nature's every dwelling-place Belong to all who care to come And make, in heart at least, a home: True, trebly true; and this, indeed, Is all the comfort that we need, Beholding, as we here behold, The new things vanquishing the old. Yet something, too, one must allow For tasteful eye and thoughtful brow; For him who fain would go apart And talk a little with his heart; For him who loves, but rarely knows, The still refreshment of repose. And if one meets (as meet he may Full often on a summer day), In what was once his lone retreat, The tracks of unfamiliar feet, And hears 'mid some poetic dream The rough loud laugh, the giggling scream Of folk who find in shrimps and tea The acmé of their revelry; If he observes the young men there Careering with the frolic fair; If in his secret adytum He scents the vestiges of rum; If they who freely fondly please Their appetite with sandwiches Have dropp'd, in memory of the event, That food's abhorr'd integument: If things like these appal his breast Who sighs for meditative rest; Of course the victim will complain Of steamboat and excursion train, Will point to those poor souls, who thus Invade our walks and elbow us, And ask, with an indignant air, What good they get by coming there? Well, has he reason in his rage? Yes, for himself: the troubled age Leaves such small help for them who strive To keep their inner selves alive: But, may not these folk struggle too? May not the many, as the few, Grow teachable through loveliness, And learn, not only to express The mirth of each swift holiday With rude repast and romping play, But well to note and study well By wave-worn rock, by wooded dell, Each gift enwrapt, each uncut gem, That Mother Nature keeps for them; Perceiving, in her joy or grief, In cool grey cloud, in glowing leaf, And all that, once within her arms, Can hush the heart from work-day harms, That this her life, the more 'tis known, Clears and intensifies our own? Aye, that they may and that they do! I know, my wife, as well as you, How men and women can behave When once they sink the sot and slave In the pure deeps of self-control. Master within his own strong soul, Have I not seen the working man Go out and gaze—as gaze he can With ardent and with skill'd delight— On whatsoever noble sight Of glossy meadow, vocal shade, Brown broomy heath, or purpled glade, Those courtier-counties can afford Which London, like a central lord, Binds to the bidding of his eye? Have we not seen, too, you and I, Men in our long-loved Lancashire, Released from loom or forging-fire, For whom their grand hill-country yields Sincerest odours from its fields; Who oft, abroad in leisure hours, Cull the light ferns and bending flowers, And search by dingle and by brook The living leaves of Nature's book? Men? Yes, and women: women, dear, Are not so slight as they appear; And theirs for all grave tasks are fit, Both in the house and out of it; If only dolt and doctrinaire Will leave their lives alone, and spare The healthful vigour of their limbs, And let them be, not seraphims (A hot-house mind, a brittle frame), But women worthy of the name; Free to profess what toil they use, And be hard-handed if they choose; Free of the needle or the spade As God Himself their will has made For this or that; and, since they dare, Man's hardest labours free to share. Yes; I admit that folks like these, Enjoying under ancient trees, Or by the sand of yon fair shores, Their brief bright glimpse of out-of-doors, (Bright none the less, it seems to me, Because they own not what they see), May carry home in heart and mind More profit of a lasting kind Than some of us are skill'd to gain; Who, rather blest in purse than brain, Can go as often as they like A-picnicking to Hayburn Wyke; With lobsters, love, instead of shrimps, And still champagne for bottle imps, And high-born fowls and Strasburg pies To stimulate their revelries! And after all, those people there Down on the Spa, who strut and stare, They are not working men, you know, Nor women neither: work, indeed! I've sometimes seen the Misses read A light three-volume tale or so, Just for a change: but even you Confess they've not a thing to do. 'Tis not the workman that I fear— It is the workman's master, dear: The man whose sons and daughters come And find no mental pabulum, No strength for life, no inner bliss, In places beautiful as this; But crave excitement, even here, For palsied heart and jaded ear; Thinking their joys, forsooth, refined, Although they differ not in kind And scarcely even in degree, From vulgar jaunts, and vulgar spree. These middle classes of the realm Have sate so long, wife, at the helm Of England, that upon my word They seem to think it quite absurd That any ranks less rich than they Should do their do, and say their say, About the working of affairs. Yet every child that says its prayers Knows that the grandest glut of wealth Shall undermine a nation's health, If they who get it will not buy Some wisdom too and modesty. A time when peers, and even squires, Are growing worthier than their sires, And helping up with ready hand The poor, who shall divide the land With princes, when their day is come; Is this a time for all and some Who dwell between (you should observe That I have neither ???? nor nerve To say this on the platform, dear), Is this a time for those who fear No judge but that Society Around whose skirts their stations lie— Makers of cotton or of ale, Tradesmen who rise until they fail, Breeders of money or of wares— To give themselves exclusive airs, And rig their wives and daughters out With expectations which, no doubt, Bring fame sometimes: but such a fame As rhymes, to ears acute, with shame? Is this— But see, how àpropos! There goes the aptest thing I know To illustrate my lengthy speech, Enforce the doctrine that I preach, And grace this conjugal address With one sweet spice of silliness. Look at him, Rosa, as he comes! How tenderly his rhythmic thumbs Graze the neat lappels of his coat! How stiffly sways his turgid throat! How dainty all his steps advance! With nose in air, and sidelong glance Intent to see who looks, and why, As great Pomposo passes by! Brimful of smiling consequence, Prepared to give—or take—offence, He seems to say, “You well may stare! Men like myself are somewhat rare In this ill-furnish'd neighbourhood.” Rare? Then the modest and the good Must be a mighty multitude! Ah, I remember him of old: But sure, I thought ere this the mould Had wrapp'd him in congenial clay: Other vile things have pass'd away; The drains are better than they were; (I grant you that at least, my dear!) The smaller vermin of the place Have long been swept with due disgrace Down the steep cliffs and out to sea: And nothing stagnates now but he. What sport it was, to see him stroll, In stately vacancy of soul, Where'er among the strollers here He track'd the shadow of a peer! You were too young to notice then The traits of manners and of men; But trust me, 'twas a common tale, His nicely-graduated scale Of sleek contempt and insolence. If haply some plain man of sense, Free from all thought of pride or pelf, And vastly better than himself, Came up with homely How-d'ye-do, He would—not cut him, that would be By far too bold a policy— But just contrive to make him rue That he had stoop'd to speak to him; Turning askance, with trembling limb And most transparent fright, to spy What eyes had seen the colloquy. Escaping thence, this thing bestows The varied insult of his bows On squire and parson and the rest; And slyly works himself abreast Of that great object of his plan, The unsuspecting nobleman. Then, with all eager flattery, He woos and wins his lordship's eye; Gains, with doff'd hat and visage bland, Two fingers of his lordship's hand; And says (with truth) he can't express This unexpected happiness. Once caught, what efforts he would spend To keep and show “his noble friend!” That every soul about might see “Lord Bunkas walks and talks with me!” He is so glad he cannot tell, To hear her ladyship is well: And the dear daughters, were they all The better for our charity ball? He has a little pew at church; And, should his lordship be in search Of some soft seat, to which a peer Might well confide his honour'd rear, He would be charm'd to offer it! “The Dean, so noted for his wit, Who comes, my lord, to favour me This evening with his company, Will preach, you know;” and thus my lord, Being insufferably bored, Accepts—and with a curt good day, Feels deuced glad to get away. Church? 'twas at church he chiefly shone, The town's resplendent paragon: How would he marshal up the aisle, With smug self-gratulating smile, Lord Bunkas, and perhaps a bart., Whom his imaginative art Had lured to sit there and be seen! While he himself, with pious mien And a most condescending grace In every muscle of his face, Said to the congregation round— Not in the vulgar way of sound, But by such looks that every word Within him was as good as heard— “Brethren, I've brought my usual peer: Be comforted—we both are here!” Then with dropt lids—for now he knew All eyes were on his cushion'd pew— He disengaged one faultless glove; And, like a slowly-settling dove, Toy'd with the folds of his cravat Before he plunged into his hat. Triumphant Christian! Having sent On high this easy compliment, He sank into an attitude Such as becomes the meek and good, Who wish their fellow-worms to see They're intimate with deity. For he had conn'd each tone and air That was polite and proper there: He pray'd with gentlemanly calm; He moved his lips throughout the psalm; And when the parson rose to speak, Though he abused him all the week, He sate benign; as who should say, “My friends, upon this blessed day I can afford to be forbearing: Pray give the foolish man a hearing!” If, too, the sermon chanced to be Preach'd for some local charity, He'd lend the aid of his high station, His smile, his graceful adulation, To benefit that sacred cause; He'd bear the bag, and softly pause Before you, with a pleading gaze, Like one who tells of better days, Whispering towards you, as it were, “Madam, be generous! do not fear, The smallest trifle is received; And (though 'twill hardly be believed) This lonely sovereign, as I live, Is all I can afford to give!” Ah, little Rosa, you look tired! You quite forget how I'm inspired By that insufferable bow The creature gave us both just now. Such play may not deserve the candle, But still, 'tis dangerous to handle The nerves of one who knows what's what, By such a galling touch as that: When the foul bird is on the wing— When the foul rat is burrowing— We fly to shoot or to unearth it, For all we know the game's not worth it. But hold; I've babbled quite enough Of this morose sarcastic stuff: It taints our pleasures as we sip; 'Ere the deep flagon hits the lip Disgusting from the lifted lid Surgit amari aliquid: Away then with his deeds and him! Look, the grey light is growing dim; Before we drive to catch the train Let's stroll about the town again And take with us, if yet we may, Serene impressions of to-day. My dear, the place is pleasant still! The old church on its gabled hill Looks to the north and to the south And grandly guards the harbour-mouth, Though Cromwell, in his royal rage, Spent there the iron of his age: No art can spoil nor take away The seaborn splendour of the bay: The castle always is the same: And ancient streets of ancient name Still wind, still climb, in storied stairs Free from new pranks and modern airs. But, best of all, the fisher-folk Speak still, as purely as they spoke When the old nurses of old times First talk'd to us and sang us rhymes In this rough language of the place, The ancient English of their race. Long may that ancient English serve To clear the brain and brace the nerve That fills these strong men of the north! Long may each lad and lass go forth With that broad symbol in the mouth, So nobly native and uncouth, Of the stout heart that beats within! Not for its Danish origin, Nor for the deeds in days gone by Done by this people's ancestry, Not for all this alone, 'twere fit To cherish and to hallow it; But for the bond that it can bind 'Twixt man and man, 'twixt kith and kind. Folks have a motive to be good Beyond the narrow tie of blood, When very speech of goodness makes Remembrance, and within them wakes Thoughts of the village where they dwelt, Thoughts of the house wherein they knelt, Thoughts of their darling who is dead; And when the stranger's plea is said, And its familiar accents heard, The loving deed, the friendly word, Leaps out with access of delight Which only they can read aright Who know the meaning of a home. Ah, love, I'm very glad we've come To-day; 'tis not a whit too soon; For, changing like the changing moon, (Only, her phases have their bound; The same fair face again comes round, And we are sure its darkening limit Will not destroy, but merely dim it, Since she is not, like us, so clever As to go varying on for ever) Changing, we'll say then, like a child, Capricious oft, and always wild, Mankind advance—or retrograde— By some new tone and alter'd shade Of talk and habit, every year; And this quaint tongue we hold so dear May speak itself an epitaph! Nay, gentle critic, do not laugh; The railway and the electric line, In working out their large design, Are bringing ruin or mischance To every antique utterance And unadulterated speech: Combining all and fusing each, And simmering the gross product down With coarse infusions of their own, Their influence, some early day, If books will let them have their way, Must seethe our English to a mess So vapid and so flavourless That not a man in all the land Shall speak, or even understand, The words in which his native county Now tells its thanks and sheds its bounty. Ah, what a loveless language then Shall freeze the lips of maids and men! As changed from this, as some old tower, Mellow'd and shaped by sun and shower, Whose every moss'd and lichen'd stone Hath bloom and colour of its own, And the warm light enriches all, Is different from a stucco'd wall. Truly, if on our isle should come That universal cockneydom, The times will then be worse than those When classic poetry and prose Were melting with the melting age, And bastard Latin was the rage: Far worse; for in that stormy day, Although the old tongues pass'd away, Imagination still was rife, And charm'd their graces back to life. Rosa, I shouldn't like to swear; But foully, dearest, may he fare, The man who scorns and not respects Our England's rural dialects; The man to whose dull ear and eye Their eloquent antiquity Seems nothing more than vulgar babble Of some uneducated rabble; Who will not see and ponder well That every common syllable Is picturesquely crusted o'er With fancy and with metaphor, And savours of the thoughts and ways Of simpler lives, and fresher days! Who, that is human, would not rise And help the reverent and the wise By tenderest culture long to stay The sad inevitable day, When all that grace and all that lore Shall dwell in living speech no more? Well, dear; if some men knew the charm A bride's within a husband's arm Creates, they'd soon get married too, To gain such listeners as you! My living speech has bored you vastly; I've had so oft my “sixth and lastly,” My “finally and to conclude:” But now I really stop for good— For here's the station and the train. You will forgive the trivial pain, The grumbling and the gossiping, Which old associations bring; For you too know how many a year We all have stroll'd and saunter'd here, In summer and in autumn hours; Since that prim ancestress of ours, With other dames, coquettes, and crones Who visited and took the air In hoop and sacque and solitaire, Fled from the Yankee rogue, Paul Jones; And lay perdues in Hackness vale, Until the pirate's fleet turn'd tail, And they came briskly back again. But one thing, love, I will speak plain, Lest the deep sea's impressive roar Should underprop my soul no more: As fades the bay, and fades the town, And fades the long-drawn green and brown Of hills whereon we trace by scores The white roads winding up the moors; As fades the thought of what we were Ere manhood came, and manhood's care; Another thought, more stable far, Springs in your eyes, and like a star Upbursting out of sunset skies, Outshines mine olden memories With hopes of happiness to come, Sure peace, and an abiding home: It is, Oh sweetheart of a life, The thought that Rosa is my wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF LOVE IN VARIOUS ASPECTS. ?????????. What is that sacred well, Wherein, as poets tell (And they are wise), Shut in its deeps fair Truth for ever lies? My tongue is silent, but my thought replies— “Your eyes!” What are those queenly stars That o'er the violet bars Of sunset rise, One in the wave, the other on the skies? How near my lips the loving answer lies— “Your eyes!” And what is that clear hue, That frank wide-open blue, That still surprise, When from the lake its fringe of shadow flies? Low in my heart persistent echo cries— “Your eyes!” So many sights around! Such musical soft sound And witchery Of airs that rock the blossom and the bee! Yet nothing shines, or speaks, or sings for me But she: All things are shows of her; And she, the interpreter, Gliding above The silent waters, or the sleepy grove, Doth swiftly make this dead earth live and move With love. What if, in such a mood, Her very womanhood Should come in view, With eyes thus bright, thus truthful, and thus blue? Ah, would she halt and give my spirit true Its due? AFTER LONG YEARS. As the hart panteth for the water brooks,— As the scared otter looks Toward his wet covert when the dogs are near,— So do I thirst and strive, in hope or fear, To be with thee. As the red kine stand huddled on the lea, Lowing until they see Who comes their swollen udders to relieve, So my full heart stands waiting to receive A touch from thee. As o'er her weaned child the mother yearns,— As the wreck'd sailor turns His face to land and wishes for the day,— So do I long and yearn to flee away, And rest with thee. As the lone voices on Sophia, borne Over the Golden Horn, Cry to the Moslem of a risen moon, So, when thou comest, all my life's a-tune With news of thee. Ah, when thou comest! the old stranded years Look fresh and bright through tears, And I am wild to welcome thee: yet why? Thou knowest always that I live or die Only for thee. For thou hast that high instinct which I prize; Thy clear unfathom'd eyes Absorb my gazing soul, and with sweet skill Show all myself to me; yea, better still, Show it to thee. So, life is good, but death should be my will If thou didst choose to kill: Thy spirit would follow if I went before, For I am thine—my God for evermore Gave me to thee. SONNET. [Petunia, do you mock me with surprise?] Petunia, do you mock me with surprise? Do you too think my heart is very hard, Because I will not offer sacrifice To that which needs no incense nor reward— Your beauty? Well, the glow of lips and eyes, And the warm lustre of sleek fragrant hair, Are beautiful: and should that not suffice? For me, I have not wont or wish to care For curious culture and achievement nice In form or manner. But there is a taste Most true and sensitive, that takes advice From heart and reason both; and this, the chaste Abiding strength and comfort of a love Sedate and simple, most profoundly move. GREEN AND DRY. To walk through life and never fling One thought upon the passing year; To scorn its summer joys, nor hear The sweet suggestions of the spring; Nor muse awhile, how sadly fair Is Autumn on her bed of leaves; Nor, when the rime is on the eaves, And all the woods are white and bare; This, doubtless, is the manly way: The furthest from those heats of youth When we were wild for love or truth, And fed with fancies every day. For then, the light from morn to eve, And all the dark from eve to morn, Was fill'd with joys of Fancy born, And triumphs which her hands did weave; And now, we do not dream at all: We work, we prosper, we are men: Until the night brings out again Phosphoric runes upon the wall. Yet, he who lives, as men should do, With money for his bread of life— Who sells his birthright for a wife, And wins, without a heart to woo; When all his gold is gather'd in, His mansion built, his park engrail'd— When all is done that once avail'd To keep the floods of memory in; He, haply, in his fields alone— No cause to feign, no need to strive,— May feel within himself revive The spirit that was first his own: May feel it, as the rural air, When winds are low on holm and fell, Betrays, to them who listen well, The music that is always there. Then shall he see, that Nature's eyes, Or lit with sun or dimm'd with shower, Are full of such a gracious power And such unchanging sympathies, That they who love her, and are true To what they know of things divine, Find there, or make, an anodyne That lasts a weary lifetime through. But, what are Nature's eyes to him? Reviving memory is a curse, With only riches to rehearse, And with a soul as faint and dim As is that mouldy cabinet, Where lie the things he used to wear— The ribbon, and the lock of hair: Ah, these he cannot quite forget! For never shall the souls that err Remit their shudders and their groans; And never shall the dead men's bones Forsake the whited sepulchre. QUEEN SOPHIA. “I know there is much meaning in thine eyes, Thy sea-blue eyes, impenetrable Queen! I know that thou art beautiful as wise, Unfathom'd as serene. “I know the moulded masses of thy hair Enclose a forehead awful as thine eyes; Awful with thoughts in which I may not share, And mutest mysteries. “And the long heave, the rhythmic calm unrest, That betters all thy loveliness, I know 'Tis born of fancies bounteous as thy breast, But secret as its snow. “Why therefore dost thou mock me with thy gaze? Why hast thou no interpreter, no moon Of love, to bring me thy reflected rays, And not thy tropic noon? “Stand up and smite me ere my reason dies— Smite me at once, or save me evermore! I cannot bear to see those solemn eyes And not to know their lore.” Then she, uprisen from her resting-place, Stood on the purple dais; and a smile Disturb'd the sacred beauty of her face With pleasure, for a while. 'Twas love, perhaps, that just a moment stirr'd Her palpitating bosom ere she spake; That touch'd her spirit, as a new-lit bird Sends ripples through the lake. But she, who master'd every wayward mood Or e'er she felt its first and faintest thrill, Composed into its old beatitude Her voice divinely still: “Oh man,” she said—and her self-lighted eyes Between their rosy lids emerging, woke An undistinguish'd splendour of surprise Within him as she spoke— “Oh man, I love for ever, if I love: I care not for the passion of a day, That breaks in thunder on the heart 'twould move, And storms itself away; “I seek a strength devout, majestical, A resolute deep steadfastness of soul, In him to whom my spirit once for all Yields up its treasure whole. “But thou art wild, impetuous as a girl; Thou wouldst unseat me from my queenly place, And whirl me down, as shallow eddies whirl The bubbles at their base: “Nor hast thou yet consider'd what thou art, How far from peace, from godliness, from Home; Nor spoken softly to thy listening heart Concerning things to come. “Go; look on life without me, till thou know, After the sure sad discipline of years, Its vernal beauty underneath its snow, Its blue behind its tears; “Till, as from each fair meadow thou hast trod, Each morning valley wreath'd in cloudy calm, So from thine own hot heart, goes up to God One sweet confiding psalm. “Go—but forget not: when the last degree Of self-control is reckon'd on thy brow, Come back; and I will keep for thee and me A love thou know'st not now.” A PARTING. 1. So, I have left my single heart with you, Before we go, and I to cross the sea. How will your own preserve it soft and true, And guard my parted treasure safe for me? 2. With light of love, with tender fruitful tears, I'll cherish it, and keep it fresh and live; That, though you should not come for years and years, It would not wither, would not cease to thrive. 1. But how should I, so long so far away, Feel that sweet care and blessed overflow? My heart at home may blossom or decay, But should I heed it—should I ever know? 2. Men that are shorn in battle of a limb Still feel the sever'd pulse, the buried thrill; And he who loves, oh surely unto him His reft and distant heart is vivid still! 1. But if, when you had done your pious part, I should come back, and then and not before Should find that I had grown another heart, And knew the pulses of the old no more? 2. Ah then, I would not look upon that change: Love would not let me; Love is so divine! What you will be, may yet be stern or strange; But what you are, is always always mine. A CONSOLATION. I wish my heart were free, Or I could nothing care On sunny lawns to see Her dancing dimpling hair, And sit in twilight nooks With languor and with sighs To mark her alter'd looks And watch her bosom rise So slow It has not even surprise To give me for my woe. I wish my heart were cold, Or I had never seen That some, in waxing old, Do keep their nature green, And, while maturest years Let others grow more sage, Have eyes still apt for tears And younger than their age; And prove Still quick to all the rage And all the slights of love. I wish my heart were dead, Or I were born again To life that is not led In these grim worlds of pain That changeful women make For men who hold them dear And cherish for their sake A faith that cannot bear To die And leave brief Time the heir Of Love's eternity. Ah, souls that long for sleep May wish and long in vain; And wings that dip too deep May never rise again; But all a woman's pride And all her love's decay Can never hurt nor hide, Can never take away, The shine Of that unclouded day When I believed her mine. A TALK ON FILEY BRIG. And so, you think your heart is young Though you are old and grey; You still can sing the songs you sung Before I went away; You still delight to prank your hair; You still can smile and sigh: Alas, I almost wish you were As callous, love, as I! These cliffs, that never seem to move, Are worn through base and brow; The rains distress them from above, The ocean from below: And thus it is with life; you see That I am not the same— Long years have scarr'd and batter'd me In temper and in frame. But you? Well, you have lain perdue From much that I have known; The warping waves have still left true Your tried foundation stone; Griefs you have had; such strengthening shocks To all sweet spirits are given; But, like the rain upon these rocks, They came direct from heaven. How, think you, if the tidal world, In fretfulness and foam, In wave by wave, were daily hurl'd Against your heart and home; If thus the granite of the soul Be rasp'd and grooved and ground, And cannot keep its outline whole Nor yet its substance sound; How can the finer heights, inwove With grasses and with flowers, Bear up against the blasts above Or stand the searching showers? They lose some grains of fruitful mould With each November day; Each storm shakes something from its hold That should not pass away; Till, sapp'd and sodden to the edge, The mouldering acres glide; And overleap the last low ledge And perish in the tide. What then? Why then (you see it there, Along yon jagged shore) The stony basement is laid bare; The cliff exists no more. I am that stony floor: 'tis all That now is left of me: But your fair peaks erect and tall Still lord it o'er the sea. Firm builded on a quiet base, Your upland slopes are seen Rich with the harebells of the place; Inviolably green; And all about your crannied leas, For meditation meant, White thoughts do pasture at their ease, And fancies innocent. So, dear, although your joys be small And you both weak and old, I would not have you, after all, Grow callous, or grow cold; I'd have you keep your inborn grace, Your native dignity; Protecting pity in your face And truth that cannot lie: I'd have you clasp my coldness in With such pathetic love As you lone Brig may seem to win From the grave crags above, Whose verdure sees from all its shelves That stretch of weedy stone Which once was lofty as themselves, And still is all their own. SEASIDE QUESTIONS. Do you know, have you ever heard tell, Why a wave rises out of the sea? Ah, then you may guess pretty well Why you are so precious to me! Do you know why the wave at its height Curls over, and breaks into foam? Then you know why I loved you at sight, And gave you my heart and my home! Do you know why the moon's face allures And governs the strength of the tides? Then you'll see in a moment how yours Drew me—and a hundred besides! Ah, folly! You ask me for what Did I choose you as soon as I saw— Would you have me give reasons for that Which itself is both reason and law? Ah, love! When I've skill to explain Why the seas or the heavens are blue, Then at length I shall not try in vain To fathom my passion for you. LUCY'S GARLAND. Here are roses, little Lucy, Gather'd all by me; Persian roses, which Firdúsi Would have loved to see. Here is bloom and tender softness— If you seek for such— Shelly pink and satin softness, Sliding 'neath the touch. Here is self-sufficing beauty— If you prize that same— Which is never dull'd by duty, Nor destroy'd by fame. Here is all the subtle veining Of a high-bred hand, Ladylike and used to reigning; Certain of command. Here, too, is a purer power And a more divine; Oh my rose, hath any flower Such a breath as thine? Thou, who dost not care to win us, Thou, so meek and shy, Blessest more the sense within us Even than the eye. You have heard my sayings, Lucy, And your mother knows That I love, like old Firdúsi, Evermore the rose; Yet, for all their fragrant breathing And their lustrous hue, Not a rose of these I'm wreathing Is so sweet as you. A JILT. Your heart is like a cloister'd nun's, From earth and love for ever free; You care not what the rolling suns May bring to others or to me. Your eyes are cold impassive disks That see not, though they seem to gaze; And woe to him who fondly risks His life in such a lifeless blaze! Your hands are white, and clasp'd, and chill; No gentle warmth is latent there; No soft caressing touches thrill A sister's or a lover's hair. Some souls are changeful, like the moon, Averted oft, and often dull, Yet still returning, late or soon, To cheerful beauty at the full: For to each change a loving law Assigns its period and its worth; Bids them at times toward heaven withdraw, Then sends them brightly back to earth. But yours is always turn'd away: It looks, we'll hope, to things above, But never casts a single ray On faces dark for want of love. And who can say, “Thy Kingdom come,” If lips like yours dictate the prayer? 'Twould almost mar their Father's home To meet such sullen spirits there. Religion, to a mind like yours, Is Hatred in a Sunday garb: All artless joys, all sportive hours, Must feel in turn her poison'd barb. She hears not, or she disavows, The choral psalms of earth and sea: No wonder that she sets your brows Against my human love and me. Live then—if life can still be dear To those whom self alone controls, Who only care to nurse and rear Their own unprofitable souls: Or die—the mould whose place you crave Will half begrudge you such a due; The wind that sighs above your grave, Believe me, will not sigh for you. IN FLORENCE. Bernardo, if you knew Or had the wit to see That I have felt for you What others feel for me; That I have loved and long'd, And passionately burn'd, And cared not whom I wrong'd, Nor whose soft suit I spurn'd, So I had once obtain'd The joy that seem'd so sweet— To fling the hearts I'd gain'd, With my heart, at your feet; If you but dimly felt What I intensely know— That those who once have knelt, And knelt an inch too low, Can never more be thralls To serve their own weak ends; (Whatever else befalls, For that they make amends!) If you had dream'd of this, Or known the strong recoil From love that yearns to kiss, To hate that craves for spoil; You would not now have dared To set my nature free, By showing that you cared For her, and not for me. What! I, whose stately tread The city praises so, I, from whose jewell'd head Such waves of beauty flow, I, in my robe of blue, And in my golden hair, Thus to have stoop'd to you— And she to see me there! There are more grinding jaws Than those which blood keeps fresh: There are worse teeth and claws Than those that feed on flesh: And mine are such as they! Mine, that are fast in you; Fast in your rotting clay; Fast in your spirit, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF IRONY. LONGO INTERVALLO. I. Jane Follett is my love, And we are both so young! Her angel dwells above, Where golden harps are strung, And bathes his waxen wings In light that is not ours; And crowns the harp he strings With unfamiliar flowers. I know my Jane is known, And hath an angel, there; Because the sun comes down So saintly on her hair; Because she looks so sweet, And smiles so tenderly, Beholding at her feet My heart's unrest in me. And therefore have I sworn By all that sleeps or stirs, To love her night and morn, And be for ever hers; And think, as I think now, That when she once is mine Our joined lives will grow Both one, and that divine! II. Jane Follett was my flame In years that are gone by; I wonder how I came To love so foolishly! I marvel what I saw In one so plain as she, To touch my heart, or draw A single sigh from me. Her angel, if he sings, It must be down below; For both his waxen wings Were melted long ago; And surely, if the sun Still thinks it worth his while To spend on such an one His consecrating smile, He must be faithless too. Faithless! She broke her troth, And when the day came due Made havoc of us both. I was so lean, and he So plump, in purse and limb! Of course she jilted me: Of course she married him. Ah well; in Chamonix I met her t'other day, And saw, with fiendish glee, She was both wan and grey. And if she'd kept her word, And if she had been mine, I could not now afford This dinner, and this wine: So, thus I drink, and swear By all that sleeps or stirs, It's not so hard to bear The loss of hearts like hers. ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. I thought you always knew it well (Although indeed you never said so)— I thought you knew I dared not tell, And that was why you toss'd your head so: For I have often heard you say You hate to see a fellow sighing, To hear him stammer all the day, And hint mysteriously at dying. And if I have adored you so, I thought you knew I couldn't help it; I could no more escape my woe Than Joseph could his empty well-pit. It wasn't fair of you at all. You moved so light and play'd so neatly, And set your foot upon the ball, And croquet'd me, I know, completely! Why did you let me look such things, And whisper o'er our melting ices, If converse with you only brings This most objectionable crisis? I wish I had not loved, for then Perhaps you would not be offended, Nor fling me back my heart again, Nor tell me thus that all is ended! Oh yes! Sir John's a charming catch— His stud, his balance at his banker's, Unlike himself, are hard to match; And I have but one horse at Spanker's! He will not house you in some den, Served by a footman single-handed— He has such store of maids and men As your position, love, demanded: And so, I quite approve your choice; I won't regret my wasted wooing; I'll think your sweet soprano voice Has warn'd me from my own undoing: And yet I know, that when too late— Just as the spectre came to Priam— You'll learn to rue your splendid fate, And wish yourself as free as I am. EVANDER. Silenus! my goblet is brilliant and cool, My bellying goblet of gold; Within and without it is storied about With the gods and the Titans of old: How the merry light dances and flickers within, Ere it melts in a soberer glow, Thorough dark-dinted veins and deep flowery lanes Toward the dusky abysses below! Silenus, my mother was rosy and fair When she charm'd down her Jove from the skies; She had light soft and rare on her amber-bright hair, And light in the blue of her eyes: But no gleams ever shone on my mother's bright hair With a lustre so strangely divine As the splendour that glides down the mellow gold sides Of this dear little goblet of mine; And no hues were so rich in her beautiful eyes As the colours that vividly roam Through the violet deeps of the wine, as it leaps Round its hissing Charybdis of foam. Drink! drink! The thick draught on our famishing hearts Like a dew shall fall luscious and clear; As it silently slips through our moist ruddy lips Not a bubble shall break its career: And if the sweet current be helpless to cure, What matter? 'Twill carry us yet Through a stormy delight to oblivion and night— And 'tis something, at least, to forget. DISCIPLINE. Philip and Farmer John. Philip. Listen to that scuffling yonder! For a wonder Tim has lock'd his drunken wife up: Hush—suppose he takes a knife up, And, enraged at want of dinner, Sticks it in her? J. Never fear, Sir! He'd not do it If he knew it: And he knows a vast, does Tim; Cherubim and seraphim Can't know more nor he do, barring Drink and sparring. P. Well—but hear her cursed clamour! Devil's glamour Rests upon that awful woman; Little's left of her that's human Save her tongue (eadem semper) And her temper. I believe she'll scrat his eyes out! How she flies out At the panels of the door! If they give, he'll sleep no more: Shall we tell him to surrender? Would that mend her? J. Not a bit! He's tried it oftens. Nothing softens Sots like them but mastery. Tell ye what, if I was he, This here stick, I wouldn't waste it— She should taste it! Bless you, Sir, you sort of witches Don't like switches: If our Tim would only spank her, Mark my words—she'd get to thank her Stars, and know it's for her good: That she would! LUCINDA'S STORY Would you like to hear Lucinda's story? She was young—or not so very old; And her father was most wise and hoary, And her mother had a mint of gold. Therefore, as they kept their crested carriage, And the aged couple had no heir, Lone Lucinda was besought in marriage Even by those who did not think her fair. Many a youth essay'd that splendid capture; One at last achieved her and her wealth: It was Jones; whose lips with honest rapture Kiss'd by proxy what he won by stealth. For Lucinda, warm and not unwilling, Nothing fear'd the terrors of Papa, Since no stern residuary shilling Could prevent her heirship to Mamma. So, when she and Jones were fairly plighted, Evermore they met at routs and balls; Evermore their troth was soil'd or whited In saloons and babbling servants'-halls. Till one day, when, full of soft beguiling, Jones, as usual, made his early call, Said the loved one, with her fondest smiling, “Do get tickets for the County Ball!” Captain Jones was not a man to parley; He went out and got them, there and then; For, you see, the duke had call'd him “Charley,” And his friends were all committee men. Shall I speak of that divine outpouring When Lucinda thank'd him for the card? Shall I tell how sweet and how devouring Was the kiss that form'd his rich reward? But a storm came on, most prematurely; (They were staying at the sea, you know, And in fashionable places, surely Storms at sea are never àpropos;) And amid the waves a struggling schooner Came right plump against the very quay; Stove her bows in; and at once, or sooner, Half her crew were all but wash'd away. Well, young Jones, who had gone forth to see it, Lent a hand to help the men to ground; But alas! ere one could say, So be it, He himself was swept to sea and drown'd. When Lucinda saw his corpse returning, When she heard them screw the coffin-lid, Did she melt in misery and mourning? Madame Tulle assures me that she did. Still, I know she found relief in croquet, And in old flirtations, great and small: As for Jones's ticket (what a joke, eh?) She went with it to the County Ball. POST MORTEM. I lay in my coffin under the sod; But the rooks they caw'd, and the sheep they trod And munch'd and bleated, and made such a noise— What with the feet of the charity boys Trampling over the old grave-stones— That it loosen'd my inarticulate bones, And chased my sleep away. So I turn'd (for the coffin is not so full As it was, you know) my aching skull; And said to my wife—and it's not my fault If she does lie next to me in the vault— Said to her kindly, “My love, my dear, How do you like these sounds we hear Over our heads to-day?” My wife had always a good strong voice; But I'm not so sure that I did rejoice When I found it as strong as it used to be, And so unexpectedly close to me: I thought, if her temper should set in, Why, the boards between us are very thin, And whenever the bearers come one by one To deposit the corpse of my eldest son, Who is spending the earnings of his papa With such sumptuous ease and such great éclât, They may think it more pleasant, perhaps, than I did, To find that in death we were not divided. However, I trusted to time and the worms; And I kept myself to the mildest terms Of a conjugal How d'ye do. “John,” said my wife, “you're a Body, like me; At least if you ain't, why you ought to be; And I really don't think, when I reflect, That I ought to pay as much respect To a rattling prattling skeleton As I did to a man of sixteen stone. However (says she), I shall just remark That this here place is so cool and dark, I'm certain sure, if you hadn't have spoke, My slumber'd never have thus been broke; So I wish you'd keep your—voice in your head; For I don't see the good of being dead, If one mayn't be quiet too.” She spoke so clear and she spoke so loud, I thank'd my stars that a linen shroud And a pair of boards (though they were but thin) Kept out some part of that well-known din: And, talking of shrouds, the very next word That my empty echoing orbits heard Was, “Gracious me, I can tell by the feel That I'm all over rags from head to heel! Here's jobs for needle and thread without ending, For there's ever-so-many holes wants mending!” “My love,” I ventured to say, “I fear It's not much use, your mending 'em here; For, as fast as you do, there's worse than moth, And worse than mice, or rats, or both, Will eat up the work of your cotton ball And leave you never a shroud at all— No more than they have to me.” Now, whether it was that she took it ill My seeming to question her feminine skill, Or whether 'twas simply that we were wedded— The very thing happen'd that most I dreaded: For, by way of reply, on the coffin-side, Just where the planks had started wide, There came a blow so straight and true That it shook my vertebral column in two; And what more might have follow'd I cannot tell, But that very minute ('twas just as well) The flagstone was lifted overhead, And the red-nosed buriers of the dead Let down a load on my coffin-plate That stunn'd me quite with the shock of its weight. 'Twas the corpse, of course, of my eldest son, Who had injured his brain (a little one) By many a spirituous brain-dissolver, And finish'd it off with a Colt's revolver. Well—when they had gone and the noise had ceased, I look'd for one other attack, at least: But, would you believe it? The place was quiet, And the worms had resumed their usual diet! Nay, everything else was silent too; The rooks they neither caw'd nor flew, And the sheep slept sound by footstone and head, And the charity boys had been whipp'd to bed. So I turn'd again, and I said to myself— “Now, as sure as I'm laid on this sordid shelf Away from the living that smile or weep, I'll sleep if I can, and let her too sleep: And I will not once, for pleasure or pain, Unhinge my jaws to speak again, No, not if she speaks to me.” THE POET JOBSON. I have a friend—“The deuce you have!” Exclaims the reader; “may we crave That you would be so very kind As just to tell us where you find That most recherché article? Who is your friend, sweet author?” Well, I here respectfully refer To Brown, the noted publisher. Brown is a rare good friend to me: His dinners suit me to a T; He keeps a hospitable board, And lives, not only like a lord, But—which is better—like a man Who sets before you all he can Although you come at curious hours. Unmindful of the drawing-room powers, He not forbids the smoke of pipes, Nor scorns the humble name of swipes; Yet he gives dainties every one, From oysters up to Badminton. In his saloons you're sure to meet The World; each person that you greet Bears (like myself, you know) a name Blown by the brazen trump of Fame; Or, if unnamed, celebrity Attends their works at least: e.g. There's Cutts, the slasher of the Times; And Butts, the ripper-up of rhymes; Mountain, the daring traveller; And Miss Poldoody (as for her, She's fifty, though she says she ain't, And yet the charmer's fresh as—paint) Who writes what women love to read, Those very telling tales indeed. Now, Sir, at Brown's I used to see A man call'd Jobson. Who was he? Why, he was one whom very few Of that selected circle knew; By trade, I rather think, a bard: He must have found it precious hard To make a living! Well, he used To come, I fancy, half seduced By some weak thought that, there and then, Men with each other talk'd as men, And not as lions. If the town Would change its ways for Mr. Brown, Perhaps they might! But when he saw How large the lion's share of awe, How always, in the same close round, Cutts chumm'd with Butts, and Mountain found His tête-à-tête with Miss Poldoody, The fellow, I suppose, got moody: Whene'er I cast an eye on him, He stood in corners, looking grim, Or edged about to get away. Well! do you know, the other day— After a voyage up the Nile To shoot the wayward crocodile— I went to Brown's; and actually He introduced that man to me As “Jobson, the distinguish'd poet!” 'Gad, Sir, although I didn't show it, I felt amazed! Had Brown divined A meaning in the creature's mind Which none had cared to seek before? About his works I knew no more Than Adam; but, compell'd to speak, I kept my tongue within my cheek, And told him—how I prized his book; And how I trusted we might look For something longer from his pen; And how, he knew, one's fellow-men Don't give at once the fame that's due, Because—it's not their nature to. Jobson, he smiled; I really think The man has humour; did he wink (I thought he did) when he replied, With proper gratitude and pride At being noticed thus by me? As for myself, I turn'd, d'ye see, And ask'd Tom Critick, whom I knew, What Brown could mean by this to-do About young Jobson? “Don't you know?” Says Tom: “I told you long ago The youth had written many a poem; But not a soul took kindly to 'em, Until, this season, he brought out The book there's such a noise about. Who set it going? 'Faith, not I— You shock my native modesty! But somehow, some one (for the cup Won't slip for ever) took it up; Gave him a fair review; and said He was no bungler at his trade. Presto! With such a start, of course The beggar never rein'd his horse: 'Twas like those bonâ fide sales Of poor Miss P.'s spasmodic tales; Straight the coy public took the hint, And read the rhymer out of print: One swift edition chased another, Each more luxurious than its brother: And he who late encumber'd shelves Is now—a lion, like ourselves!” By Jove! said I: but Tom, d'ye know It strikes me we were rather slow Not to perceive all this at first? The hapless being had not nursed What secret stuff there was in him, Nor guarded it with looks so grim And such a proud ill-manner'd bearing, If we had given him a hearing. What if they didn't read his rhyme? Jobson was Jobson all the time! “Ah but (says he) you make the event An ex post facto argument. How can you call us fellows slow? We hadn't found him out, you know.” Exactly, Tom! 'tis very true: So, en revanche, he's found out you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF DECAY AND DEATH. VESTIGIA RETRORSUM. White-throated swans and sedges of the mere Still float, still quiver, on the shining stream; And underneath an antique bridge I hear Smooth waters lapping slowly, and their gleam Frets the cold dark wherein my boat is moor'd: Nor overhead the storied elms of June Forget to murmur, nor to welcome noon With quiet: save when some stray breeze, allured By fragrance of the central avenue, Creeps, cooling ever, down the elastic arch, And through branch'd clifts and green inwoven shelves Lets in fresh glimpses of the sultry blue. So year by year regardless Nature blooms; So year by year, for all the far-off tombs Of those who loved them, these impassive courts Lay their calm shadows on the grateful sward: No change is here, nor any peace is marr'd Save ours, who, pausing in life's midday march, Miss the dear souls of all these fair resorts And find instead our own forgotten selves. IN THE DESERT. “What are these shallow shrunken pools That lie about us on the way, Whose brackish savour never cools A thirsty summer's day?” “That blithe broad river from the hills, That roll'd at sunrise through the land, Has sunk into a thousand rills, And perish'd in the sand.” “What are these stragglers of the heath, Each cowering by his rusted blade, And slowly hungering to death, While no one gives them aid?” “A banner'd host went forth at day, To win their Prince his diadem: They fail'd, they fled, they fell away— And these are all of them.” I speak but fancies: if there dwells, Perchance, such meaning in the words As comes to us from village bells Or from the song of birds, Take it, ye loneliest and best— Ye secret ones who strive and fail, Who do not prosper in your quest, Nor find the Holy Grail; Who have no fruitage of your loins But labour, and the lifeless jar And jingle of those hated coins, That made you what you are! Yea, Love is of the early morn, So frail, so sensitive, so shy; A thing that with the dews is born, And with the dews must die. NUDUM REMIGIO LATUS. We think our heart shall never fail In doing good, in righting wrong, In comforting the weak that ail, In marching forwards with the strong; We think our spirit shall not cease Its scrutiny of false or true, Its hope forlorn to patch and piece The ancient wisdom with the new: Yet all the while there lives within That solemn strife of soul and sense; Or, after strife, a worse sets in— The languid lapse of indolence: And we are nearing all the while The wandering isles of Doubt and Death! Ah well—perhaps the sea-nymphs smile, Perhaps the immortal gardens breathe, On other galleys which have pass'd In safety through the narrow seas; Although our own be crush'd at last Between those dark Symplegades. THE FLYFISHER. By Richmond Force, by Easby Dale, Full swiftly flows the shallow Swale; And hazels dusk and plumy trees Caress his waters, till the breeze Shall send them, rippling as they run, To sleep unshadow'd in the sun, Or glide between the stones that make A stepping-path for Mary's sake: Who, with poised foot and wavering arm, Comes lightly over from the farm, To search the woods above the sluice For cowslips or for berry-juice. The river rests a moment there, For Mary's image is so fair; Then beats his heart in foamy fear On the slape margin of the weir. Of all his streams a feeble few Come bubbling o'er or trickling through, But he sweeps round to that moist lair Of hart's-tongue and of maidenhair; And rolls his volume, deep and still, Down the dark mill-race to the mill; And leaps, as smooth and sheer as steel, Upon the fearful waterwheel; And, churn'd to freedom as he falls, Swims out beneath the abbey walls; And spreads his current wild and wide, And trims his front, and checks his tide; And rests at length in that calm pool Where leaves are lush and fruits are cool, And zephyrs, breathing overhead Among the chequer'd treetops, shed In starry pattern o'er the place Dim shade and lustrous interspace. We know the time, we know the spot— Dear Tom, my heart forgets it not; For you and I by yon green lane Came, one to fish, and one to feign Such shapes as crowd on fancy's eye From dimpled stream, from dappled sky. How well I see you, by that shore Where you and I shall meet no more, High-booted hero of the flood! How plain I see you, as you stood (And all that lissome length of rod Laid near you on the dewy sod), Showing, with fond and skilful eye, The hooks, the hackles, you would try, Within that fateful book of yours! Ah me! so long as life endures, When Hope is sad and Memory grieves, That well-worn book, those homely leaves, Wake thoughts more serious than serene Of all that is, and might have been. But now, my friend, with youth and pride In each stout step and league-long stride, You plunge into the midst, and brave The terrors of the gurgling wave. Far whirls the managed line; the fly Sits the dull'd water tenderly; By envious bough and treacherous hole You cautious wade toward your goal: That stone where, deep in amber lymph, There lies the only water-nymph That, out of school, a schoolboy heeds— The big trout, watching ere he feeds. “Come near, come near me, if you dare, You fisher with a single hair!” Not he! he spies your haunt too well, This master of a subtler spell Than Izaak and his angle knew. He throws—in vain he seldom threw— The lithe rod quakes from tip to heel, And furious whirrs the whizzing reel; Three minutes, and that trout is laid Beside me in the elm-tree shade. How fair he is, how cold, how sweet, As here he lingers at our feet, Leaps on the turf, and shows or hides The fresh vermilion of his sides. His weak gills throb—his callous eyes Are glazing—hide him, ere he dies! Ah, Tom! the spirits from their world Fling many a baited line, uncurl'd To float invisible and clear Within our grosser atmosphere, Till some poor wretch, intent to sup, Bites: and at once they pull him up— Or down. And think you, when he's there He finds his lungs more fit to bear That sudden burst of alien air, His life less sad in those new bowers, Than this poor trout found his in ours? Alas, though I have yet to know, You knew the answer long ago. But, when the bait is set for me, And I have gorged it fatally, I shall not feel that other air So strange, O friend, since you are there. IN THE FOREST. What is the doubtful beauty of the dawn, So tremulous with hope, to that most sure Completed splendour, which is overdrawn Upon the earth at sunset? We grow pure By looking on the purity of eve, And know that it is better to remove From all sweet tongues would win us to believe The morrow will be lovely. This is love, This western rose; and this is also death: What more? Of old I knew a secret wood, Where often stirr'd the warm and hurried breath Of fleeting fallows, or that coarser brood Who scorn each other with defiant arts, As we do. There, that very time of dews, I've seen them come: the tall full-throated harts, Tawny above, tann'd to rough auburn hues, Or dappled like the round of eastern shells; With antlers branching up from russet roots To tips as white as when the creamy cells Do loosely hold fresh-fallen chestnut fruits Under a hedge in autumn. With swift ease, Soft cushion'd o'er the hoof in spongy moss, Or fetlock-high in rushes, toward the trees They trode together, noiselessly, across The open marish; and behind them came Their does and trotting fawns, in lightest bonds Of love submissive led. I could not blame Their feet, that trampled through the brittle fronds Of mellowing bracken, and that soil'd and shred The amber tints of ruin on those leaves That crisp'd beneath their crushing. So they fled Into the velvet shadows of the eaves Of elms that narrow up into a glade At distance. Purple hills grew dusk beneath The awe of closing twilight; sombre shade, Slow, solemn, leagued with solitude and death. Oh happy, flying with their mazy horns For ever down the forest, all as one; One dim existence, which the golden morns Renew, until at evening 'tis undone In sleep! Existence, through all stags and hinds And tender fawns, so languidly diffused And handed down, that not a creature finds Aught in its shallow self that might be bruised With lasting woe or shame. For Life, the high Keen life that comes by thinking, and that dies With thought (but he who owns it cannot die); The individual being, whose strange prize Is still to suffer and to be alone; This they have never. We who are so wan With having it, in all the earth have known The isolation of Consummate Man. OCTOBER. Fair leaf, so crisp and curl'd and yet so fair, Whose veined purples shading into bronze Make autumn lovely; is it hard, for once To fall thus gently through the silent air And die? Fair bird, uprising from the startled brake On wings that only bear thee into death, Is it such pain, to leave thy haunt beneath The hazels, and of wounds that man can make To die? Fair rose, yet lingering where yon topmost spray Climbs through the trellis o'er the garden wall, Is it such grief, to see thy petals fall So fast, and having watch'd them all away, To die? Thus while I sit and murmur, half in dreams, Across the valley like a parted soul Shoots the white steam of travel: though its goal Be far, it dips into the earth, and seems To die! Ah then, I said, if death be only this— Through the dark hills a channel short and wide That leads to sunshine on the other side— Then better than the best of life it is To die. AN EXCEPTION. Oh yes, my friend, in many sad sick rooms I hear the solemn sound of sobs and sighing: Yet everlasting Nature buds and blooms While each sweet soul is dying! I know not if she also hath her grief From autumn chills or winter weariness; But this I know, that not a flower or leaf Is beautiful the less. Say, that she hath a heart of gentle ruth; That all she does is done for you and me: And still, her blessings bring this bitter truth, That we are less than she. The earth that masks my coffin when I'm dead, The earth that once was man and now is mould, No happy fruits from out of it are bred, For all its former gold: She uses it; but only as a foil, To show how rotten rankness is unwise: She breeds her beauty in a purer soil, From better ancestries. One thing she uses not, nor can destroy; One only thing, that hath been tried and proved: The singular unutterable joy Of loving, and being loved. AUTUMN: A TRIPTYCH. I. Autumn, her airs are heavy with decay; Death's sombre certainty succeeds his fear, Till all her crisped foliage drops away: Yet she and hers are dear. Yet? 'Tis the very secret of her charms; That deep affection which our natures have For all that fills her brown and wither'd arms, Is given to the grave. We know, but haply know not that we know, How far the rosy riot of the spring, Or suns of summer, filling with their glow The very shade they bring, Pomps of the gallant year! how fast and far They trespass, and what bright unbidden trace They leave, upon those desert-growths which are The soul's abiding-place. We know it, and resent it: not because It is not sweet, that they have so transgress'd; But that their beauty hath no lull, no pause, To show or to suggest The spirit which mild Autumn makes her own: Which comes, like distant peal or muffled psalm, When hearts are still, and leaves are floating down. Its name? Its name is Calm. II. Come then with all thy grave beatitudes, Thou soother of the heart and of the brain, Autumn! whose ample loveliness includes The pleasure and the pain Of all that is majestic in despair Or beautiful in failure. Hast thou fail'd? The winds of heaven among thy branches bare Have wrestled and prevail'd; Yet, the fall'n bough shall warm a winter hearth: The lost leaves kiss each other as they fall: The ripen'd fruits are garner'd off the earth: Thou hast not fail'd at all. Nay—thou hast neither failure nor success: Thou wearest still thy lustrous languid wreath With such sweet temper, that its hues express No thought to thee of death. Serene in loss, in glory too serene, All things to thee seem most indifferent: Thou art as one who knows not what they mean, Or knows and is content. So yon fair tree, pure crimson to the core, Burns like a sunset 'mid its company Of golden limes; and cares for death no more Than if it could not die. III. Summer, as rich in shadows as in suns, Spreads her thick foliage thicker every day; She is most bounteous; her free spirit shuns To give and take away. But thou, grave Autumn, dealest otherwise: Creating noble colour, and withal Rifling the woods that bear it, till our eyes Can penetrate them all. And then, what hidden wonders do we see! What half-forgotten glimpses of our past, Veil'd since the spring, though each dismantled tree Peer out again at last! Love them or hate, we cannot but behold: Gable, and church, grey turret and blue hill, Or bran-new horror built with recent gold— All are before us still. So, if the great sea ebb, full many a wreck Above the branching coral grimly towers; Full many a ragged skeleton on deck Lies deep in living flowers. So, when the mists of life rise up, and poise Along the crumbling edges of the grave, What quick regrets, what keen remember'd joys, The weak heart has to brave! Yes, thou canst show us some things; canst betray The gaunt square mansion or the ruin'd wall; Thou, Autumn, dost it for us every day: And Memory is thy thrall. But, not the baring of the summer trees, Nor dying down of tall obstructive flowers, Nor poise of mists above the yellow leas, Nor glow of sunset hours,— Not all that thou canst do or we can dream, Wins for our purblind souls this one poor bliss— To see beyond and through the things that seem, To that which only Is. N'IMPORTE. An egg dropt down 'twixt the old hen's wings Into her nest so warm; And she cluck'd for joy, and away she flings, With never a care how her egg may fare, Nor a pang if it come to harm. A fruit slipp'd out of its bursting pod Into the moist brown mould: But hoofed beasts went pawing the clod, And the tree that bare danced aloft in air, While its fruit lay crush'd and cold. A flower so sweet, which a bee had loved, Brake off in the wind, and fell: And the bee came back, as he ranged and roved, And saw it lie there, and said he, “'Twas fair— But another will do as well.” A nut shrank out of its filbert-cup, Where a twin grew fast beside: And the sap for both did that twin drink up, Till he cried, “Oh ho! How I swell and grow, Now that my brother hath died!” A year sank down at the touch of Time Into the great Unknown: But the bells rang out a birthday chime, And the cold skies' glare threw a starry stare On the world that was still their own. A soul came shivering out of its corse Into the arms of Death: And Death, as he leap'd on his swift pale horse, Heard the mourners swear that they could not bear The fume of a dying breath. For little it matters to Nature's ends, And little it helps our own, That mothers are loving and friends are friends; That we have our share in a nation's prayer, Or die like a dog, alone. And little it matters to Nature's plan, That one is alive or dead: 'Tis the work she cares for, and not the man; If the father die, she will let him lie— But the son shall toil instead. And Time, as he stalks to his long dark home, Keeps lightening his load with glee: And he cares not a jot for the days to come, But swings his scythe, as he shouts so blithe “They may flourish or fail, for me!” THE WOLF. The Wolf forsook his gory tracks, And dull and listless grew his eye; His fangs were worn, his limbs were lax; The time was come that he should die. The lambs abroad upon the leas Had all been told of his decay; Said, “Now we'll do whate'er we please, And freshly feed, and freely play, “And frisk afar from mother's bleats Through buttercups and daisies pied, Or stand and suck her milky teats, With none to fear us from her side.” The Wolf he heard them in his lair, And oh but he laugh'd merrily! Said, “This their jest it is so rare, Though I am weak, it rouseth me. “My two grey cubs, both fierce and young, Come hither hither unto me! Your teeth are sharp, your nerves are strung, And you are ripe for revelry. “Yon lambs afield, you silly brood, Are richly fatted through and through: Their elders were your elders' food, And they, my cubs, are food for you. “Those lambs, upon their frolic mind My terrors now no longer lie; But oh what feeble fools and blind To think the Wolf shall ever die!” IN THE MARSHES AT LANDWICK. The old horse stands by the side of the road, But nobody minds him now; For he hath no heart to prance and play, And he hath no strength to plough. His knees are bent, and his feet at stride, And his head hangs loosely down; And a ragged lock of his old grey mane Droops over his old grey crown. His legs are swollen from hock to heel, His loins are hollow and bare; And the beard that muffles his lank lean jaws Should never by rights be there. His low-hung lip is moist and long, His nostrils closed and cold; And the lids fall down on his bloodshot eyes As down on a corpse the mould. The mark of the harness is on his neck; The mark of the beast doth shine In the rugged folds of his weary mouth, On the ridge of his sunken spine. And thus he works at another's will, And hides in another's home; With never a hope in this sad life, Nor yet in the life to come. QUESTION AND ANSWER. Are there no lilies on Havering pond, Under the elm-tree boughs? Many a one! Are there no maidens fair and fond Left in the manor-house? Never a one. Are there no tufts of London-pride Under John Watson's wall? Many a one! Hath he no sons still by his side, To answer the old man's call? Never a one. Are there no cattle on Fielden farm, No doves in the dove-cote, still? Many a one! And how many friends sit snug and warm Round the ingle of Farmer Will? Never a one. Are there no people in Havering church, At matins and evening prayer? Many a one! And the parson who planted that silver birch, Are he and his house still there? Never a one. Do the tall flags yet rustle and wave In the water above the mill? Many a one! And the flowers that grew upon Laura's grave, Doth any one tend them still? Never a one. ONE IN BEDLAM. The light that fades from earth and sea Will come, for you, to-morrow morn; But not in this fair sky is born The sun that waits for me. Before they bare me to the ward, And just before I slipp'd and fell, I saw a thing that pleased me well In Ebenezer yard. I saw the lean unthinking knave Who lays our corpses, ere they're cold, So neatly in the hired mould— I saw him dig my grave. I touch'd the clay beneath the stones; 'Twas moist; and as I peer'd about Long swollen worms crept in and out Among the scatter'd bones. So, as I paid the churl, I said He must not dig my hole too deep, Since I would hear the nibbling sheep Above me, when I'm dead. For, look you, while they browse and bleat They'll bless the unremember'd name Of him whose tender juicy frame Has made the grass so sweet. And yet I would not hear too well, When preachers o'er the stifled pews Breathe blandly what they call Good News; News of a coming hell! Good news? Why, here's an acre, cramm'd With silent mouldering men, who lie Around your pulpit as you cry; And are they, too, all damn'd? And is there still, for ever, room For all the thousands without end Whom priest or puritan may send Down to a burning doom? God knows—and I shall shortly know: Yet, though no hallow'd shade will fall Of ivied tower or grey churchwall Where I am laid below; Though no sad sacred yews will yield Their leafy dirges to the breeze, Nor fling memorial-phantasies Across yon mounded field; Nor cross, divine with antique charm Of quiet hope, be mine; nor prayers, Nor flowers, to which the righteous airs Bring not a touch of harm; Though nought be there my soul would crave, I know I shall be happy still, And not without contentment fill My cheap suburban grave: For, spite of sins not small nor few, They'll call me Brother when I die: And will there not be One on high Who calls me brother too? I think so; men may curse or kill, And devils clutch the parting ghost; But He is near who loves us most: And He will save us still. DE PROFUNDIS. Our Marian's husband has been drown'd at sea! Far under rolling storms he lies asleep, Enchanted into that tremendous calm And awful silence of the midway deep: The weight of ocean water bears him up, The weight of ocean water holds him down; Rots his pale flesh, and loosens all his bones, And saps the sodden tresses from his crown: So he, dissolving in a still decay, Floats ever, like the coffin of Mahound, Poised in the indistinguishable grey Where thousand corpses, dead without a wound, Are mingled up with his. But she, whose eyes Forget that he has perish'd; she, who sits Rocking his children's cradle, or with sighs Fondles her married finger on her knee And frames his features in the friendly fire; She does not know him thus! To her, to her, His air is always radiant, and the ire Of Death has left him beautiful and kind; Nay, made him more—a saint of God indeed. We then, who gaze and pity, shall we say Her soul takes comfort in a shallow creed False to the facts of fate; and call her hope And fancy fruitless, and her deep desire, So sacred and so sorrowful, a dream? Or, rather, think that grief doth re-inspire Her emptied heart with odours from above; That truths beyond our credence are made plain To her most faithful memory and her love?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SIX FAREWELLS. I. [Well may the sun be grave and dim] Well may the sun be grave and dim That sets into another year; Well may we watch his death with fear, And dream that Nature dies with him. But no; the silent shadows creep Still slowly downward from the eaves, And still beneath unruffled leaves The robin calmly goes to sleep; And still aloft the wild-duck leads Her babbling fellows through the sky; And still the river loiters by Among the willows and the reeds: 'Tis only we, who feel forlorn; Who feel, that now the day is done There is a secret something gone That comes not back to-morrow morn. So thought I, gazing on the grey Sad west, in which such “red renown,” Such hope, such beauty, have gone down Since last December died away. And lo, behind me lovelily Rose in a burst of silver flame The fair completed moon, who came Too late to see her brother die. She sorrows not, I said; she sees The gulfs of mystery that divide This fateful night, and she will glide Across them, in her stately ease! Why should she not? She sees not Death, The sole interpreter of time; She hears not how our spirits chime And falter, with our faltering breath; She knows not of our greed unblest, Our grim chronology of war, The everlasting heights that are Between us and the Land of rest; She knows not how our souls were fed With grief, with fury, day by day, Till all we lived for was to slay Those foul tormentors of the dead. Oh saddest of our England's years! Till now, we never seem'd to know What hells of misery lie below The shallow sources of our tears. Who, who may succour them that grieve? Who shall bring back the mirth of morn, And with its ancient peace adorn The dusk magnificence of eve, While many a wife, so lately fair, The darling of her dwelling-place, Now hides her blank afflicted face Among the pillows, in despair? Ah, speak not, if thou speak to bless! They used to tell us in our youth That Mercy somewhere meets with Truth, And Peace is wed with Righteousness; But now, we care not what may come Of woes or blessings, to the door; Our house is shut for evermore; A land we know not is our home: Our hearts are with the dying year; Our eyes are on the setting sun; You say, that comfort may be won— We only know, it is not here. II. [The Love that walks alone, and free] The Love that walks alone, and free From all restraint of buried days, Along those consecrated ways Where all who linger, yet may see His faded footprints mix'd with hers— Oh, this is not the Love for me: Since times like these were meant to be The callous heart's remembrancers. And yet, why should we think or feel? Why should we probe the stricken year For secrets that we dare not hear, For light that nothing can reveal? “No, let it keep its own;” we cry: “Let hopes, let memories, as they list Die off into this sullen mist, And leave no phantoms when they die.” All sombre, like ourselves, to-day The year goes blindly to his rest; No red farewells are in the west, And all is colourless and grey: Grey are the skies, and dull and pale From bend to bend the river creeps; And many a league of moisture steeps The sodden pastures of the vale. So, heedless of the passing year, This cold oblivious afternoon Sleeps into darkness; and no moon Will wake it when the end is near. Could we have timed December's death, And draped the hours to meet their fall, How rich had been each funeral pall, How sweet the dirge, how fair the wreath! They should have perish'd open-eyed, And blest with unction and with priest; And, conscious of her babe at least, Maternal Evening should have died. But no—'twas better to be thus: This broad circumference of shade, In which no shadows can be made For want of sunshine, is to us A type of what we are; whose eyes Were once alight with tender tears, Where now no passing thought endears The sacred moment as it flies. Sunshine and cloud, scarce noticed, flow O'er swarthy glebe, on batter'd wall: But evermore the shadows fall Most darkly on the matin snow. III. [Not now upon the silent Ings] Not now upon the silent Ings, Alone with fancy's make-believe, I watch the grey decline of things That marks another New Year's Eve. Steep curves of snow on either hand Above the crashing river lean, As once the hollow'd waves did stand While marching myriads swept between. But grinding ice and wreathen snow And rushing stream are far away; And that red sun, I know not now If he hath set or shone to-day. Alone I wait this solemn tide— But not alone in vale or glen; The good green earth on every side Is choked with houses and with men. Yet, the great heavens are always here: Above the glimmer of the Thames One sees their purple hemisphere Still writ with old heraldic flames; Still heaving, soaring, toward the noon Of night, while we below sit mute, And feel as in some vast balloon Where all the earth is parachute. And men, too, heed this closing time; For toward me through the dark there swells, In startled gusts, the trembling chime And thick salute of midnight bells; And clocks, as various as the creeds, Strike discord from their windy walls, Until to such weak rout succeeds The deep decisive boom of Paul's. That is the hour! along the floors Of life it speaks the very din And thunder of the dungeon-doors That shut another captive in. And have we, then, no thrilling spasm, No quick uplifting of the head, While audibly this vital chasm Yawns 'twixt the dying and the dead? Not now. We once had hearts like yours— Repeaters of the perfect round, That throbb'd in music through the hours, Still, bell-like, stricken into sound By all that ever came across The order'd impulse of their ways; By hope and joy, by grief and loss, And by the placid-moving days: But now, the candid face is hid, The frank sweet tongue has ceased to move; And daily devilries forbid That homely household voice of love. And well, that those true hands are still— And well, that tongue has ceased to sway— For all our morrows cannot fill The place of one bright yesterday. Ah, brother! we must look behind, Toward that far land of make-believe— Of keen and conscious youth—to find The blessedness of New Year's Eve. IV. [Let us look out: the clock is striking twelve] Let us look out: the clock is striking twelve; The stars are frosty, and the night is clear; The bells will soon begin. Why should we shelve Our common thoughts as this one hour draws near, And fall to musing, every New Year's Eve? Is it not ill, to sit i' the sulks and baulk The mirth of them who ponder not nor grieve; That we forsooth may flutter like a hawk Poised o'er the future, or stand still and gaze, Like herons in the marshes, on the round And mooned reflex of departed days? Ah, you are young; your step is light on ground; You fly to see the dayspring of the new, We stay to watch the setting of the old. Yet hear me: he, who loves to keep in view All phases of the nature manifold His manhood comprehends—if, how he grew, Or shrank, from the clear oneness of a child To such a complex turbid soul, that knew (Alas the knowledge) why he wept or smiled; If this, maturer man would understand; There is no way, no wiser better way, Than thus to lay his ear upon the land And listen for all steps that may bewray The lost retreating past; than thus to light On every hill-top, rosy with the prime Of vanish'd morning, which is still in sight Above the rising water-floods of time. Old hours, my friend, old epochs, you and I Should cherish; and to-night there is an hour On whose brief life no common ancestry Of risen memories centre all their power. Each crowns her with its ghostly diadem: Each watches o'er her. Let us watch with them. V. [And art thou going, then? Alas, I've seen] And art thou going, then? Alas, I've seen The deaths of many good as thou; and been, Perchance, a little touch'd thereby: at times Touch'd into music, only just to see The last moon rise upon a year like thee. But now, what need of music, or of tears? Coming so fast, the apt-succeeding years, They bring no leisure for the twang of rhymes: They bring the roar of railways, the smart scream Of hissing engine and of galloping team That bellows through the darkness, fledged with flame, And we think nothing o't! I've heard that same Hyæna-howl, within the roofless naves Of ancient abbeys; heard it mount in glee O'er the grave murmur of the reverend sea, Whose waves, they say, sing praises. Is there praise In these rude Titans, for the King of Days? Yea, truly: 'tis an uncouth voice, of slaves Not yet uptrain'd to freedom and to good, But mix'd with evil. Their resulting mood In days beyond our own shall doubtless rise, But not, ah, not in ours: for when the cries Of steam do mock these old cathedral towers, Æolian winds sigh after them; and I Draw thence a meaning deeper than the sigh. God rest the soul of Beauty! She is dead, And we her mourners ever: but instead Of glad New Years, and calm nutritious hours Of rest, we know the things we have to do: To fight, to work, to fail—and yet be true. VI. [This is the final sunset of the year.] This is the final sunset of the year. Brown crumbling clouds creep o'er the wintry blue And thicken westward: but beneath are clear Transparent spaces of a vernal hue— Delicious green, and gold: and under them A melting crimson deepens and grows large, Mellowing the gold, and purpling that grey hem Of evening mist, that hides within its marge The moist horizon. Upwards, to the south, Begirt with earth-born shapes, that shrink and swerve To make free passage for her crescent youth, The new moon leans, a cold contemptuous curve, O'er that red gulf wherein the sun went down. Thus, from his placid heaven regarding hell, The patriarch leant, and saw that sinner drown In flame for ever. Abraham did well, And so does she: her joys are all to come; The joy of diamonding white-frosted trees And lakes of lucid ice: or lighting home The loud result of midnight revelries. Meanwhile, upon the confines of the west, High o'er you sere and sapless pasture's gloom, Long lines of elms, in solemn order drest, Stand like dark Dante at the burning tomb. They move not; yet, against the changing sky, They seem to change: as shadows on a wall, Grotesque and huge, repeat with irony Fair forms most shapely and most virginal, So these traduce their own umbrageous selves. For when they fronted morning, and the air Was bright with summer, even he that delves Would love their leafy fulness and those rare Deep-nested secrets—egg and moss and bird And startling squirrel—which the rudest hind Might gather there: yea, music too was heard Among their boughs, for him whose gentler mind Could leave such harmless treasures undestroy'd. But now, these barren skeletons inspire Nothing but horror; every hideous void Between their blacken'd ribs is fill'd with fire— A foreign heart of fire, that beats and glows Till in the dusk its pulses die away. Ah, they may die; but the awed spirit knows These sights are symbols of that sad array Of hopes and joys, long nursed or newly born, Which in the twelvemonth grew to be most dear, Yet cease to-night, and have no after morn.— Thus with its final sunset ends the year. THE END.</field>
