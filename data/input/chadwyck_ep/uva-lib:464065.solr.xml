Al is þe tale and þis lescoun Of hire swete assompcioun, Hu heo was fram erþe ynome In to blisse wiþ hire sone. Þe kyng of heuene hem blessi Þat þis listneþ and wel herkni. Alle moten hi iblessed beo, Þat vnderstonde wel þis gleo. Whan ihesu crist was don on rode, And þolede deþ for vre gode, He clepede to hym seint Iohan Þat was his o?e qenes man, And his o?ene moder also; Ne clepede he hym feren no mo. And sede, “wif, lo her þi child, Þat on þe rode is ispild. Nu ihc am honged on þis tre, Wel sore ihc wot hit reweþ þe. Mine fet and honden of blod buþ red; Biþute gult ih[c] þolie þis ded. Mine men þat a?te me to loue, For whan ihc com fram heuene abuue, Me haueþ idon þis ilke schame, Ihc naue no gult; hi buþ to blame. To mi fader ihc bidde mi bone Þat he for?iue hit hem welsone.” Marie stod and sore weop; Þe terres feolle to hire fet. No wunder nas þe? heo wepe sore; Of sore?e ne mi?te heo wite nomore, Whenne he þat of hire nam blod and fless, Also his suete wille was, Heng Inayled on þe treo. “Alas, my sone,” seide heo, “Hu may ihc liue? hu may þis beo? Hu mai ihc al þis sore?e iseo? Ne cuþe ihc neure of sore?e no?t; Mi leue sone, wat hastu þo?t? Hou schal ihc lyue biþute þe? Leue sone, what seistu me?” Þo spac ihesu wordes gode, Þer he heng vpon þe rode, And sede to his moder dere, “Ihc schal þe teche a trewe ifere, Þat trewliche schal loky þe, Þe while þat þu in erþe be.” Þo seide vre lord to seint Iohan, “For my loue qep me þis wymman. ?em hire wel wiþ al þi mi?te Þat noman do hure non vnri?te.” In to þe temple mid hire he nam, And also sone so he þar cam, Among þe lefdis in þe stede, God to serui he hire dude. Þer bilefte heo al hure lif; Ne louede he noþer fi?t ne strif, Þeo þat in þe temple were, Ne mi?te no?t hire forbere. Wiþ al hure mi?te þe while heo was þore, Heo seruede boþe lasse and more; Poure and sike he dude god, And seruede hem to hond and fot. Poure and hungrie wel faire he fedde, And sike heo bro?te in here bedde. Nas þer non so hol ne fer, Þat to hire nadde mester. Hi louede hure alle wiþ here mi?te, For heo seruede hem wel ri?te. He wakede more þane slep; Hire sone to serui was al hire kep. To him heo clupede wiþ Murie steuene, And hire he sente an aungel fram heuene, Te gladie hire him self he cam, Crist þat fless of hire nam. Seint Ion hire kepte and was hire dere; He was hire eure a trewe fere. Nolde he neure fram hire gon; Al þat heo wolde he dude anon. Þe whiles hi were in þat stede, Al þat heo wolde he hit dede. Whane heo hadde beo þer longe, Ten wyntere hem amonge, Hire sone wolde heo come hym to, Whane he hit wolde, hit was ido. He sente hire on Aungel of heuene, And grette hire wiþ murie steuene. In þe temple he bad hire bede; Þer li?te þe aungel in þat stede, And sede, “lefdi ful of grace, “Wel þe beo in eche place. Ne beo no?t of drad þe? ihc beo her; Ihc am þi sones Messager. Fram hym to þe ihc am icome Þe grette wel þi dere sone. Flur of erþe, of heuene quen, Iblessed mote þu eure ben. Wel beo þe time þat þu were ibore, For al þis wordle were forlore; Ef þu nere and þat frut of þe, Marie lefdi, wel þe be. Lefdi, best of alle þinge, Wel bliþe bode ihc þe bringe, Nym þis palm wiþ þi ri?t honde; Hit is þi dere sones sonde. He þinkeþ long hym to se; Ne schaltu her no lenger beo. He wile senden after þe, Fram heuene adun of his meigne, And fecche þe in to his blisse, Þat eure schal leste wiþute misse. Þer he is kyng þu schalt beo quen; Al heuene for þe schal bliþe beon.” Þanne ansuaredi vre lefdi, To þe aungel þat stod hire by, “Artu Mi sones Messager, Þat bringest me þis greting her? Haþ he set me any day A?enes þat ihc me greþi may, And nyme lyue of mine kenesmen, And myne frend þat wiþ me beon, And of him þat haþ me cloþed and fed, And don also my sone hym bed?” Þo sede þe aungel, “ihc telle þe; Þu ne schalt beo her bute da?es þre. Þe þridde day we schulle come, Aungles fram heuene aboue, “And fette þe wiþ murye song; For after þe us þinket long.” Þanne ansuarede vre lefdy, “What is þi name, belamy?” He sede, “my name ne telle ihc þe no?t; Bute nym þis palm þat ihc habbe þe bro?t, And kep hit wel ihc bidde þe; Ne let hit neure fram þe be. I ne dar no leng dwelle her, For ihc was sent as Messager. To þe apostles ihc schal gon, And bidde hem alle, eurech on, Þat hi beon her þe þridde day; No leng abiden I ne may.” Þo he hadde ydon, to heueue he ste?; Marie abod and was wel sle?, And nam þat palm þat hire was bro?t, And of þat bode heo hadde gret po?t, In to hire Chaumbre stille he nam; And so sone so heo þar cam, He dude of al hire hatere, And wessch hire body wyþ clene watere, Þo heo hauede so idon, Al y newe schrud heo dude hire on. Þo heo was schurd and faire iclad, To ihesu crist abone heo bad, And sede, “sone, ihc þonky þe Þat þu hauest iþo?t of me. Sone, þu ert of heuene kyng, Ihc bidde þe þi blessing; Sone, for þin holy name, Schild me fram pine and fram schame, Þat þe deuel ne habbe no my?t; To derie me hit were vnri?t. Sone, help me nu ihc haue ned, Þat ine haue of þe feond no dred, For wiþ þe giles þat he can, He bitraieþ many man. “Leue sone, ne ?ef him no?t, Þat þu hauest so dere ibo?t. Sune, þu art ful of pite; For senful manne bid ihc þe, Þat þu for þin holy grace, ?ef hem boþe wille and space, Hem to amendy er hy beo ded, Þat þe deuel hem do no qued. Þenk, sone, þat þu hast hem wro?t, And þat þu hauest hem dere ibo?t. For hem þu þoledest pine and wo; Wite hem wel fram here fo.” Þo heo hadde biso?t so, Hire frend he clupede hire to, Boþe sibbe and fremde Men, Wiþ reuful speche heo spak wiþ hem, And sede, “leue frend, my sone Nele no leng þat ihc her wone; He wile ihc wende and mid him be. And bidde ihc ?ou par charite, ?ef ihc habbe eny þing mis wro?t, Telle? hit me, ne heleþ hit no?t. Ihc wulle amende, and þat is ri?t Þat my saule ne beo idri?t. Þat god ?e habbeþ me ydon, Mi sone þat was in rode ydon, Man to bigge fram þe ded, ?elde hit ?ou at ower ned, And bringe ?ou in to þat blis Þat eure ilest þar my sone is.” Alle þat stoden hire by, Of þat tiþinge were sory, And sede, “lefdi, hu mai hit be? Hu schulle we liue wiþ outen þe? Lefdi dere, what hastu þo?t? Reu of vs; ne wend þou no?t. “In sore?e and in Muche wo Schulle we lyue beo þu vs fro.” Þanne spak vre lefdy To hem þat were hire by, “Lete? beon; ower wepinge ne helpeþ no?t; Habbeþ ioye in ower þo?t. Þe while ihc am her, wakeþ wiþ me; Hit doþ me god þat ihc ?ou se. Nabbeþ no drede ac witeþ hit wel; Of pine ne schal ihc þole no del. Ne schal no sore? come me to, For my sone hit wule so, Mi body ne schal no pine þole, For he was þer of ibore, He þolede pine him self for me, Þo he deide vpon þe tre. He þat is almi?tful kyng, Schal me sende of his geng. Iohan and þe apostles, whei hy be, Alle hi schulle come to me.” Þe while he spac þus to þis men, Of al þat þing nuste no?t Ion. He com to speke wiþ vre lefdi, And hym þuste heo was sori, And sede, “lefdy, what is þe? For my seruise tel hit me. Lefdi, what is þe ised? Me were leffre to beo ded, Þane iseo þe make such chere. What is þe, my lefdi dere? Ne schal ihc neure habbe blis, Fort þat ihc wite what þe is.” Vre lefdi wep and Iohan also; Trewe loue was bituex hem tuo. “Lefdi,” he sede, “what is þe? For my loue, tel hit me.” Marie ansuerde wiþ Milde steu[ene], “A sonde Me cam while er fram h[euene], The Cambridge MS. ends here. The Harley MS. 2382 is used as the source text from hereon. fro my sone a messynger; he woll no lenger that y be here. but y wote that rueth me, that y shall departe fro the; for thi loue and thi seruice that thu me dost in al wise. thu hast made me ofte glad; thu has done as my sone bad. my sone shal it yelde to the; y wol hym pray when y hym se.” Tho answerd to here seynt Iohan, and was a full sory man, Iohannes “A, lady Marie, what shal y be when y shall the no lenger se? my ioye thu art euery dell; no lenger in erthe worth y well, now we shul departe a two.” Then seid Marie, “whi seist þou so? for sothe, thogh y go be-fore, Maria yet shal thu not be for-lore. y shall pray my lef sone, that thu may vnto vs come. And o thyng, Iohan, y bidde the, for the loue thu hast to me, loke anone when y am nome, nota hic verbis Marie that the fals Iewys ne come my body for to done shame, for thei haten moche my name. thei wole feyn shame me, that honged my sone on þe rode tre. y wote well thei loue me noght; ther-for thei bene mysthought. when y am be-nome fro the, to my body they do no foly. Ihesu Crist oure allere dright, gef ham neuer that ilke myght.” seynt Iohan answerd tho, Iohannes “sey me, lady, if it is so, that we shall departe atwo. “swete lady, how shall y do? sey me þe tyme when it shal be, that thu shalt to heuene te.” she seid, “Iohan, that þou shall se; ne bide y here but dayes thre.” Maria Then was Iohan ful hertely sory. Iohannes wepand he seyd, “dame, mercy! how shal y leue? how shal y fare? now cometh al my sorow and care. my lord was hard y-broght to deth, thurgh fals Iewis that couthe no meth. now shal oure lady me fro; now cometh to me al my woo. wold god that y were ded, for right now can y no red.” Maria “Nay,” she seid, “whi seist thu so? angelis the shall come to, and loke to the where thu be, erlich and late to comfort the.” when she spake to seynt Iohan, thapostellis cam yn euerychon), nota de apostolis omnibus miraculose. and none of hem wiste be-forn), how thei were theder y com, and seid, “lady, ne drede þou noght, thi sone hath vs hider broght, to knowe the for oure lady, while that we bene the by.” “Blessid,” she seid, “be my sone.” Maria glad was she was of here come. “y am his moder,” so seid he, “glad ther for may y be. now when it is my sones wille to hym y come, and that is skyle, to my body ye loke al so, that my foos ne come ther to. moche hateth they my name; ther for wold thei do me shame. y you bidde pur charite, for the loue ye haue to me, when y fare to heuene blisse, waketh ther my body ys. loketh bothe nyght and day, that þe Iewis bere it not away. thay wold it brenne or do shame. Ihesu, for thi holy name, gef ham neuer strengthe to haue my bodi in erthe for to laue.” Thei answerd, “for sothe, y-wys, it shal be as thi wille ys.” The whiles Marie badde here bone to the apostellis euerychone, an Angel a-light on that stede, Angelus and seid, “Marie, god herd þi bede, and all they that bene with the; “loke that thu arayed be. thu shalt to heuene and be quene; ful blithe may thi hert bene. thu shalt in hast be in heuene.” when our lady herd this steuene the angel seid here then to, ful of blisse was she tho. to here bed she went to aray, a-boute þe tyme of hy mydday.

Marie awaked then seynt Iohan and the apostels euerychon, thre maydens þat were the[re]-ynne, and no man els of hire kynne. “waketh now, and slepe ye nought! Sone y worth to heuene be broght; now is tyme y were a fare, Shall y neuer more suffre care.” Tho cam Iesus from heuene, Ihesus with angelis and archangelis seuene, yn to hire boure with mery song; moche merthe was them among. no wonder thogh ther be blisse in eche place ther Ihesus ys. none of them that were there a soche blisse saw they nere. amonge al blisses of the trone Mary knew here leue sone.

The palme þat Petre had in hond, he toke it hym, thurgh goddes sond, and bade hym goddes word to telle to the Iewis that were so felle.

In honorance of ihesu cryst Sitteþ stille and haueþ lyst; And ?if ?e wille to me here, Off oure ladi ?e mai lere, Floure of heuene, ladi and quene, As sche au?t wel to bene, To wham aungeles doun here my?t To serue hure boþe day and ny?t. Par auenture ?e haue no?t iherde How oure ladi went out of þis werde: Sitteþ stille and herkeneþ to me; Now ihesu cryst oure helpe be! Whan ihesu crist was doun on þe rode And þolede deþ for oure goode, He callide to hym seynt Iohan, That was his fleschli kynnes man. His moder swete he dide also; He callid no men mo him to. And seide, “womman, lo here þi sone, And, man, take hure to moder in good wone. And þenkeþ on my sorwe nowe How I hange here abowe, How I hange apone a tre, Ful sore, I wote, hit reweþ þee. Myn feet, myn hondes, of blode ben rede; With owte gilt I þole dede. But þei haue wille to louen me For wham I hange on þis tree. The Iewis me deden mychel schame; Ther of hadde I neuer blame.” Marie his moder sore dide wepe; The teeres fellen at hure fete. Nas no wondre þou? sche wepe sore; Of sorwe wist sche neuer more. When he þat of hure flesche nam, For his holi swete nam, Honge þer nailed to a tre, “Alas, my sone,” þo saide sche, “How mai I lyue? how mai I bene? How mai I þis sorwe ysene? Neuer ere wist I of sorwe nou?t; Leue sone, what hauest þou þou?t? How schal I leue with oute þee? Leue sone, what saist þou to me?” Ihesu spak þo wordes goode, As he henge on þe rode, And seide to his moder dere, “I schal þee take a trewe fere, That trewly schal kepen þee, While in erþe þou schalt be.” Than seide Ihesu to seynt Iohan, “For my loue kepe wel þis womman. Kepe hure wel with al þi my?t, That no man do hure vnry?t.” Þan nam þe apostel, seynt Iohan, On his kepynge þis womman. He kept hure wel with al his my?t, That no man do hure none vnry?t. To þe temple he hure nam, And also sone as he þer cam, God to serue he hure dede, Amonge þe nunnes in þat stede. Ther sche bileft al hure lyfe, Ne loued sche noþer fi?t ne stryf. The ladies þat þer Inne weren, Ful wel þei ne my?t hure forberen, For euer þe while sche was þore, Sche wolde serue las and more. Seke and hole sche dide gode And seruede hem to hande and fote. Naked and hungry sche cloþed and fedde; Colde and seke sche brou?t to bedde. Ne was þer noþer seke ne fere, That þei nadde to hure mystere. Thei louede hure wel with al here my?t; Sche it serued and þat was ry?t. Sche woke more þan sche slepe; Hure sone to serue was al hure kepe, To hym sche callid with rewful steuene, And he hure sent an angel fro heuene, To glade hure, hym self he cam, That of hure bodi flesche nam. Seynt Iohan hure keper was hure dere, And to hure was a trewe fere. Ne wolde he neuer fro hure gone; Al þat sche wolde he wolde done. While sche was in þat stede, Al þat sche wolde he hure dede. When sche hadde þer longe ben, That faire ladi, heuene quen, Than wolde hure sone sche com him to. When he wolde, hit was do. He sent to hure an angel of heuene, That gret hure with myry steuene, Ther sche was and bad hure bede, Ly?th an angel in þat stede, And seide, “ladi, ful of grace, “Blessed be þou in eche place. Be nou?t adrad þou? I be here; I am þi sones messagere. Fro hym I am to þee come; He gret þee wel, þi dere sone. Floure of erþe, heuene quene, Blessed mote þou euer bene. Wel be þat tyme þat þou was born, For al þis worlde hit was forlorn, ?if þou ne were and þe fruyt of þee; Marie, ladi, wel þee be. Ladi, best of al þinge, Bliþe tiþynges I þee brynge, Thou take þis palme þat I brynge þee; Thi dere sone haþ sent it þee. The þynkeþ longe him to see; Ther fore most I no lengere be, He schal sende after þee Of heuene ferde moche plente, And brynge þee in to his blisse, That euer was and now is. Þer he is kyng, þou schalt be quene; Al heuen ryche bliþe schal bene. And alle him þenkeþ swiþe longe Til þou comest hem amonge.” Than answerede oure ladi, And seide to þe angel, “belamy, Art þou my sones massagere, That bryngest me þis bodes here? Haueþ he me sette any day, A?ens when I me greithe may, With my frendes and my kynnes men, And with hem þat I in erþe haue ben, And hem þat I haue fedde and clad, And don al þat my sone hem bad?” Tho seide þe angel, “I sei þee; Thou schalt be here but daies þre. The þridde dai we schal come, Alle ix. ordres fram heuen a boue, “And fecche þee with myry songe; For after þee vs þinketh longe.” To þat aungel seide oure ladi, “What is þi name, þat standeþ me bi?” “My name seie I þee nou?t; But take þis palme þat I haue brou?t. Kepe it wel, I bidde þee, Ne lete it neuer be fro þee. Ne mai I no lengere abide here, For I am sent a massagere. I schal to þe apostles sone anone, And seie to hem sundry, on and one, That þei ben here þe þridde dai; No lengere abide I ne mai.” When he had iseide, to heuene he steie; And marie þer bi-left he. Vn-til hure chambre sone sche nam; And also sone as sche þider cam, Sche dide of hure cloþes alle, And wasche hure with water of wille. So sone as sche hadde doun, Newe cloþes sche dide hure apoun. When sche was faire schred and clad, To ihesu cryst aboue sche bad, And seide, “sone, I þanke þee, That þou hast yþou?t on me, My sone, þat is heuene kynge, I praie þee of þi blessing. Sone, for þyn hye name, Schelde my bodi fro payne and schame, That þe deuel haue no my?t; To reyue þee hit were no ry?t. Kepe me, sone; now is nede That I ne haue of þe deuel no drede. For with þe wiles þat he can, He bigileþ many a man. “Leue sone, ?eue hym nou?t Man kynde þat þou hast bou?t. Mi sone, þat art ful of pite, For man kynne I praie þee, That þou, for þi holi grace, ?eue hem boþe my?t and space, Hem to amende or þei ben dede, That þei haue of þe deuel no drede. Thynke, leue sone, þou hast hem wrou?t, And dere þat þou hast hem bou?t.” When sche hadde praied so, Hure frendes sche callid hure to, Hure sibbe and hure kynnes men. With reuful steuene sche spak to hem, An seide, “leue frendes, my sone Wol no lenger þat I here wone. He wol þat I with him be; Where for I praie ?ow par charite, ?if I any þinge haue mys wrou?t, Seieþ me now; for-hele ?e nou?t. I it wole amende with my my?t, That my soule haue no vnply?t, The good þat ?e haue doun me, My sone þat was doun on þe tree, Man to bigge fro þe quede, He ?elde it ?ow at ?oure nede, And brynge ?ow in to his blis, Ther I schal be and my sone is.” Alle þat weren hure bi, Off suche tiþinges weren sori, And saide, “lady, how mai þis be? How schulle we lyuen with oute þee? Ladi, þou hast vs serued so; Alas, how schulle we parte a two? Swete ladi, what is þi þou?t? Rewe on vs; departe vs nou?t. “In moche sorwe and in myche wo Schulle we lyue, be þou a go.” Þan answerede oure ladi To þat folke þat stode hure bi, “Lateþ be ?our greding hit helpeþ no?t; And haueþ blis in ?oure þou?t. Whiles I am here, wakeþ with me; Hit doþ me good þat I ?ow se. Haueþ no drede in wel; Of peyne schal I þole no del. Mi bodi mai no peyne þolen, For he was þer of y-boren. He þoled deþ him self for me; He honged nailed on þe tree. Mi sone þat is kyng of heuene, Schal me sende worde wel euene; Iohan and þe apostles, where so þei bene, Schulle alle come for to sene.” As sche so spak to þe mon, Off al þat wist nou?t seynt Ion. He come to speke with oure ladi; Ferli him þou?t þat sche was sory, And seide, “ladi, what is þee? What is þis folk þat I here se? Seie me, ladi, what is þee?” he sede; “For me were leuer þat I were dede, Than I þee se suche semblaunt make, “For schal I neuer suche a ladi take. Hastou ou?t herde þat I ne can, Off me or of any oþer man? Schal I neuer haue blis Til I wite, ladi, what þee is.” Oure ladi wept and Iohan also, For trewe loue was bitwene hem two. Iohan seide, “ladi, what is þee? For þi sones loue, seie þou me.” Marie answerde with rewful steuene, And seide, “me cam bode fram heuene, Fro my sone a massagere; He wol no lengere þat I be here. Wite þou wel hit rewiþ me That I schal, Iohan, parte fram þee. For þi loue and þi seruyce That þou hast doun on eche wise, Thou hast me boþe fed and clad, And doun also my sone þee bad. My sone schal it wel ?elde þee; I schal him telle when I him se.” Than answerde seynt Iohan, That was a ful sori man, And seide, “ladi, how mai þis be That I schal þee no more se? Mi ioie, my blis, is doun eche del; Ne schal me neuer worþen wel, Sithen we ben parted atwo.” Þo seide our ladi, “why saistou so? Wite þou wel, I go be-forn; Thi seruyse schal no?t be forlorn; I schal to my sone seie of þee That þou with hym and me schal be. But herestou now, my frende Iohan, When þou sest þat I am gon, Kepe my bodi þat I ne be binomen, When þe fellon Iewes comen, Mi bodi forto doun no schame, For þei hate no þing more þan my name. Mi sone þei hongen on a tre; Wel I wote so wolde þei me. I wote wel þei louen me nou?t; But þer of be þi most þou?t. When I am parted, Iohan, fram þee, That þei do my bodi none euelte. My sone, þat woneþ in heuene li?t, Lete hem neuer þer to haue my?t.” “Ladi, sithen hit is so, That we schal departe a two, Seie me how long hit is to þan.” “For soþe,” marie seide to Iohan, “Bi þis and þe þridde day, No lenger abide I ne may.” When he it herde, he was sory; He wept, and seide, “ladi, mercy. How schal I lyue? how schal I fare? How schal I blis or ioie haue? Furst my lord was brou?t to dede, Thorw þe felun iewes rede, And now my ladi wil me fro, Swete lord, now me is wo. Wolde my lord I wolde be dede, For I ne can no better rede.” “Iohan,” sche seide, “whi seistou so? Th[e] aungeles schal þee come to, To kepe þee where so þou be, Erliche and late to gladen þee.” Whiles he spak so to seynt Ion, Come þe apostles euerychon, To gidre; but þei wist nou?t How þei weren to gidre brou?t; Off oþeres come ne wist none; But of hure come bliþe was Ion. He cust hem alle, so fayn he was, And seide, “deo gracias; Blessed, ihesu, be þi my?t, For it is faire and hit is ry?t That þi moder come to þee, That sche faire welcom be Of þine apostles þat most þee louen, I ne wote how þei ben hidre ycomen.” Than seide Petyr to seynt Ion, “Whi art þou so sory A mon? “Whi wepistou, and what is þee? For felaschip telle þou me. I schal þee seie, seynt Ion, Whi I am so sory a mon, But seie me furst, for godes loue, Whi ?e arn hider icome, And weryn so wide isprad: Seieþ what haþ ?ou hidre ilad.” Tho seide Petyr a ferli þinge: “I was fer hens atte my prechinge. I was so henne in anoþer londe And helde my boke in my honde, And tau?t men of my sermoun, I ne wote how I cam to þis toun.” So seide alle þat weren þere, Suche wondre sawe I neuer ere. None of hem ne wist þorw wham, Ne what wai þei þidre cam, Than seide seynt Iohan, “for soþe, I wys, I schal ?ow telle what it is. Comeþ wiþ me in to þis hous; Oure ladi þer abideþ vs. Sche ordeyneþ hure to fare vs fro, For hure sone hit wolle so. Hure sone haþ sent his messagere; He wol no lengere þat sche be here. And hider he haþ ?ow alle ysent To kepe hure bodi when sche is went. Bi fore hure knele ?e alle bi-dene And seieþ, ‘ladi, heuene quene, Off alle wymmen, best þee be; Thi sone vs haueþ sent to þee, To kepe þee and do þi wille: Vs þenkeþ wel þat it is skille, That heuene and erþe bowe þee to, For þi sone hit wol so, Thi sone, þat is heuene kynge, And alle þing haþ in his kepinge.’” Than comen þe apostles alle, And bi hure bigan to falle. Vp ros oure swete ladi And kist þe apostles bi and bi. Off here come sche was glad; Alle þei dide þat sche bad. Sche asked hem how þei come þere, That sprad so sundry were. The seide in ful good þou?t, “Thi sone vs haþ hidre ybrou?t To kepe þee, and by þee by; Ther fore we comen to þe, lady.” Ful bliþe sche was of here come; “Blessed,” sche seide, “be my sone! When it is my sones wille That I come him to, hit is skille. Mi bodi ?e schal kepe so That þer-to come nou?t my fo. Kepeþ faire my body, That none do me no vilany. The Iewis ben ful of felony; My sone þei slow þorw enuye. The haten no þing more þan my name, God late hem neuer do me schame. Ther fore I praie ?ow, pur charyte, And for þe loue þat ?e haþ to me, When I am faren to heuen blis, Wakeþ alle þer my body is. Kepiþ it boþe ny?t and dai, That no Iewe stele it awai. Thei wolde it brenne or do it schame; But ihesu, for þi holi name, Late hem neuer þer-to haue my?t, For sikirli hit were vnry?t.” Thei seiden, alle soþe, I wys, “Hit schal be, ladi, as þi wille is.” Whiles oure ladi spak so To þe apostles þat come hure to, Come an aungel and stode hure bi, And seide, “wel þee be, ladi, And so be alle þat ben þee bi; “Loke þou be ful redi. Þou schalt to heuene and be made quene; Ful bliþe mai þine hert bene. Alle schal þee serue, þe company of heuene.” As soone oure ladi herd þat steuene That þe aungel seide hure to, Wel ful of Ioie was sche þo; Sche ?ede to hure bedde and lai, A bowte þe tyme of myddai; Iohan and þe apostles weren hure bi, To kepen hure as oure ladi. Sche badde Iohan and þe apostles alle. To kepen hure what so bi falle. Sitteþ now stille, boþe more and lesse, And herkeneþ of þe moche blesse Off Ihesu, þer he come so ly?t: He dide his moder ful moche ri?t, As a sone au?t his moder to done, He callid þe aungeles euerychone, And alle þe mayne þat was in heuene, And seide to hem with mury steuene: “Commeþ with me to my lemman! Sche is my moder; hure sone I am; Off hure I toke flesche and blode. And sithen I hange on þe rode, I þat euer was and ay schal ben, In al þis blisse þat ?e here sen, I hadde reuþe on al mankyne, That alle went to helle pyne. I made man to serue me, And þorw þe appel of a tre, That adam toke and ete it Inne, To helle he went, and al his kynne, “Hit rewid me, and for-þou?t sore, And I it wolde þole no more. I ly?t doun, and man bi-cam, And of þat maide flesche nam. “Bi fore alle oþer I hure ches, And I was born of hure flesches. Thritti wynter and somme del more, Men to wissen, I was þore. Men dide me moche euelte; Myn owyn þat ou?t for to be, Thei token me and bette me sore, And atte þe last þei dide wel more, With oute gult þei me swongen, And to a piler þei me bounden. Nailes þei smyten in my fette; Off blode myne handes weren rede. Myn hert þei stongen with a spere; That sawe alle þat weren þere. Ther I hange nailed on þe tree, My modre was wel wo for me, And also was hure cosin Ion. I callid hure to me soone anon, And seide, ‘Iohan, for my loue, Kepe wel þis wyf; I am hure sone.’ Boþe þei wenten þo fro me; Al one I hanged on þe tree, Mi soule fram my bodi I nam, In to þe pyne of helle sone I came. Alle my frendes þat I þer fonde, I toke hem oute with my ry?t honde, Adam and Eue and many mo, I dide hem oute of helle go. When I hadde harwed helle, And don as I ?ow telle, And fet adam fro þe quede, The þridde dai I ros fro dede. Fram erþe to heuene I cam; God and man, bothe I am, In heuene and in erþe is my my?t; “Now I wol forþe in ry?t, That my modre be me bi; This tyme I wol for þi, Comeþ with me with mury songe, And do we hure come vs amonge.” Than cam ihesu with his mayne, Aungeles, archaungeles, moche plente, In to þe chambre þer sche was Inne, with ful many of hure kynne. That chambere was ful of moche blis, As euer is þer ihesu is. Tho seide alle þat were þere, Suche a blis sawe þei neuer ere. Amonge þat Ioie and þat glewe, Oure ladi, hure sone knewe. When sche him sawe, sche was glad; Listeneþ þe bede þat sche bad: “Sone, blessid mote þou be, That þou bicome man of me; Hit is wel sene, I am þee dere, Now þi self art comen here. Thine apostles þou sendist furst to me, And now þou art come with þi meyne, To fecchyn me in to þi my?t: Was neuer modre sone so bry?t. Mi leue sone, now art þou come With þi meyne, here a bone. Do, my sone, þat þi wille is; To þee me þinkeþ longe I wis.” “Modre,” he seide, “come with me; Of alle wymen best þee be. Thou schalt to heuen and be made quene; Wel bliþe may þine hert bene.” “Sone,” sche seide, “I be-seke þee O þing þat þou graunt me, That I no?t þe deuel se, Ne none þat euer with him be. “I loue hem nou?t; þei arn my fone; Ne wolde I neuer sene hem none.” “Moder,” he seide, “ne drede þee nou?t; Ne come it neuer in my þou?t; Ne wille I neuer more þole That any of hem come þee bi fore; Ne schal þou neuer se-ne here But me and aungeles, þine fere. Moder, a ?ift I schal þee ?yue, Thou schalt with me in heuene lyue, And more schal I ?eue þee; Al heuene companye schal serue þee. “Modre, for þe loue of þee I schal haue mercy and pite Off al man kynne for þi praiere, That were forlorn ?if þou ne were. Alle þat doun þee worschipe, And seruen þee wel, and treuliche Bi seke to þee, and mercy will crie, And seyn, ‘help, seynt marie,’ In what peyne so he be, Moder, for þe loue of þee, I schal hem reles sone anon; For þi loue I schal þus done. ?if any haue ben al his lyue In hede synne, maide or wyue, And he wille, on his last þrowe, Schryue him and ben y-knowe, And telle it, ?if he haue þe prest, Or a noþer man þat is him nest, And ?if he ne mai do no more, But þat him forþinkeþ sore, In what synne so he be, Moder, for þe loue of þee, I schal on him haue mercy, And sithen þei schulle wone þee bi. “?if a man hadde al one wrou?t Alle þe synnes þat my?t be þou?t, And he on his last dai, ?if he none ere ne mai, Repent him, and calle to þee, In what synne so he be, I schal here his praiere, For þi loue, modre dere, Al þat þou wolt bi seke fore, Be it lasse, be it more, Hit schal ben aftur þi wille, For I it wille, and þat is skille, Þat no þing with seie þee, Off þat þou wolt biseke me.” Oure ladi knelid him bi forn, And seide, “þe tyme þat þou were born, Ouer alle oþer blessed þou be, For alle þat I wol, þou grauntest me.” “So I au?t, moder, and so I wille;” He left vp his hond and blessed hure stille; His blessing sche þou?t good, And he hure soule vndrestode. He callid to him seynt my?hel, “Thou kepe me þis soule wel, Thou and alle þine fere; Is no þinge me so dere.” Alle þat mayne þat cam fro heuene, Thei syngen with a myry steuene; Men my?t wite bi here songe That moche ioie was hem amonge. With alle þat mayne to heuen he hure nam; And as soone as he þer cam, He made hure quene of heuen li?t; Blessid be hure sones my?t! amen! Now schal we here of þe bodi, Where it bi cam, and where it li. When þe soule was þere fro hure nomen, Than bad god Peter to him comen, And seide, “Peter, I comaunde þee, Mi moder bodi kepe þou me. Iohan and alle þine fere, Nis no þinge me so dere; When I furst in þis worlde cam, Off hure bodi flesche I nam; Off hure bodi, I was born. Petyr, go forþe þou be forn, Thou and alle þine feres with þee, To Iosephat, to þat vale, And leiþ þe bodi in a stone; Haueþ no drede of ?oure fone; Goth with faire processioun To ierusalem þorwe þe toun. Doþ þe belles alle to ryngen, And loke þat ?e mury syngen. Loke þat ?e haue candele, Torches boþe faire and fele. Foure of þe apostles schal bere þe beere; Ther-on schal ligge me modre deere. Haueþ no drede of no Iew, For I my self schal be with ?ow.” When ihesu hadde him so seide, And þe bodi was on bere leide, He ?af hem alle his blessinge And stye to heuen, þer he is kynge. To hym þo seide seynt Ion, “Felawes, go we soone anon, And turne we þis processioun, And synge we faire þorw þis toun.” Ther was a Iew hem amonge, Off þe apostles harde þe songe. To þe beere he cam lepand, And as he wolde lai on his hande; To þe bere he cleued fast, And to Petir he criede atte þe last, And seide, “Petir, þenkest þou nou?t, When þi lord was to vs brou?t, Thou him forsoke, and I þe knewe? Praie for me,” seide þe Iewe, “Praie þi lord, ?if I mai so be, That he haue mercy on me. Thenke,” quod þe Iewe, “what I þee dede. When þou was with vs in þat stede, When þi lord was ytakyn, And þou haddest him forsakyn, Oure mayne þee knewe þat ilke ny?t Bothe bi speche and by sy?t, And seiden alle, for I stode þee bi, That þou was of Ihesus companye. Thou seidest with wordes and with þou?t, ‘For soþe þat þou knewe him nou?t.’ Praie þi lord of moche my?t, And his moder þat art so bry?t, That he me help at þis stounde, For I was neuer so harde ybounde. As I þee helped atte þi nede, ?elde me, Petir, now my mede.” Seynt Petir answerde þo To þe Iewe þat was so wo, “?if þou woldest leue on him, That on þe rode dide þi kyn, That he is soþefast godes sone, God and man for him bi come, That marie bare in hure lyf, Clene maide and clene wyf, Clene widewe with oute wem, For þee I wol praie þen, Ihesu cryst vs li?teþ aboue, That he, for his moder loue, So ?eue þee my?t for to go, And bringe þee oute of þi wo.” The Iewe þat henge apoun þe bere, Answerde anone as ?e mai here, “I leue wel, and better I schal done, On ihesu crist, godes sone, That Iewes diden on þe rode, And for vs he schedde his swete blode, That marie bare in hure lyf, Clene maiden and clene wyf; He brynge me, I praie it him, Oute of þe wo þat I am Inne.” As soone as he hadde seide þis bede, He was al hole in þat stede: Off fote, of honde, he hadde my?t; Alle his lymes bi come ful ry?t. He stode vp swiþe anone Bi-fore þe Iewes euerechone, That suche a myracle haþ done, Ihesu crist, godes sons, Of a wilde hounde haþ made a lomb, To preche his worde in eche a lond. Seynt Petir, þat holi man, The Iew he crystened anone, He tau?t him al his bi leue; He wist he was to godes biheue; He ordeyned him to prest anone, And bad him soone for to gone And prechen al of godes sone, In eche a lond where he come. That palm þat Petir helde in his honde, He toke it him þorw godes sonde, And bad him godes wordes telle Among þe Iewes þat were so felle. So he spak þe furst day, That he turned to godes lay Twenty þousand and sommedel mo, Thorw wordes þat he spak þo. Foure of þe apostles þat were þere, That swete bodi forþe þei bere, The Iewes þat were godes fone, Thei herde þe cri sone anone, And þei asked what was þat crie, And men seiden it was mari, That seynt Petir and his fere Bare þare apoun a beere. “Alas,” seide þei, “for schame, Ascape þei vs, we schulle haue blame. Arme we vs alle sone anone, And take we hem alle þer þei gone. That bodi þat þei bere, nyme we it, And cast we it in a foule pit, Or brenne we it, and do it somme where, Or cast we it in a foule sere.” Thei comen lepand þiderwarde, And þat hem fel swiþe harde. Ihesu wolde nou?t þat schame; He made hem boþe blynde and lame. Off hem alle, was þer none That my?t a fote on erþe gone. Here mouþes were to here nek went; Thei þou?t alle þat þei were schent. Boþe here feet and here handes Where bounde with stronge bandes: Ful sore bounden þei were, For þei ne my?t go ne here. Than comen here frendes hem to, And seide, “alas, whi leie ?e so, In ?oure armour so fast ycli?t, That beþ so faire and so bry?t? ?oure speres, ?our schildes, helpeþ ?ow nou?t; Telleþ vs what ?e haue þou?t.” Thei answerd nou?t þat leyen þere, For þei ne my?t hem no?t here, But somme of hem þat my?t speke Seide, “alas! who schal vs wreke?” And euer þei cryede many a stounde, “Alas, how harde we lie here ybounde!” Off fyue þousand was þer none That my?t of þat stede gone. Than seide some þat stode hem bi, That hadde ysene þat ferli, That ‘seynt Petir and his fere Bare oure ladi on a beere, “Thise men wolde hure haue nomen,” And þus þei ben ouer comen. The ladi þei wolde haue doun schame; Ther fore þei hauen godes grame.’ The folke hem bad mercy to crie To ihesu cryst of here folie, And leue þat he is godes sone, And siþen crysten men bi come. “We hope þat ihesu schal sone tyme Delyuere ?ow of ?oure pyne.” Thei criede “mercy” with good wille, Somme lowde and somme stille, And ihesu, þorw his mochil my?t, Here feet and handes gan to ry?t. Thorw myracle þat þer was doun, Bi-come cristene many on, And leuede on cryst and criede mercy, That none oþer god was so my?ty. The apostles went forþe on here way, To Iosephat, to þat Valay. When þe apostles comen were, Wel softe þei setten doun þe beere. With gret deuocioun, euerychone, Thei leide þe bodi in a stone, And bileft alle in þat stede, As oure ladi hadde hem bede, And woke þer al þat ny?t With many torches and candle ly?t. On þe morwe when it was dai, Thei loked where þat bodi lai. Thei ouerturned þat ilke stone; Bodi þei founde þer none; But þei sawe in þat stede þana Liand as it were a mana. That manna bitokned hure clene lyf, That sche was modre, maide, and wyf. Tho wist þe apostles, I wis, The bodi was in to paradis, Also godes wille was. Thei seide, “Deo gracias.” Seynt Thomas of ynde þiderward cam Also blyue as he my?t gan, And wolde haue ben at hure fyne, ?if he my?t haue come bi tyme. As he loked him bi side, He sawe a bri?tnesse bi him glide; Bi þat stede þer he come, Oure ladi to heuene was nome. He knelede doun and seide, “ladi, Off me, I praie ?ow, haue mercy. Ladi, quene of heuene ly?t, For þine swete mychel my?t, Sende me token þis ilke day, What þing þat I say may To myn felawis, þer I hem fynde, That I was toward þi buriynge. Thei wil nou?t leue þat I were; Now graunt me, ladi, my praiere.” A-bowte hure myddel a seynt sche sou?t, That sche hure self hadde wrou?t, Off silk and gold wounden in pal; Doun to thomas sche lete it fal. He toke þer þe gurdel in his honde, And þanked hure of hure sonde. Forþe he went of þat stede; Toward þe toune he him dede, His felawis for to seke on his fete, ?if he hem ou?t my?t mete. Atte þe temple dominus He fonde hem alle in an hous. When he hem sawe, he gret hem, And þei answerde alle hym, And seiden, “thomas of ynde, Euer art þou bi-hynde. “Whare hast þou so longe bene? We haue buried heuene quene. Thou helpest no?t at no good dede; Thou failest euer at most nede.” “Sore me forþinkeþ þat I ne was here, But I ne my?t come no nere. Blessed be sche, quene of blis, In þat stede þer now sche is! For wel I wote bi my þou?t, Ther ?e hure left, is sche nou?t.” Than seide to him sone anone, Bothe Petir and seynt Ione, “Thou ne woldest, leue thomas, That oure lord fram deth ras. Come, þou art mys bileuyd, And tales ynow þou canst fynde, Thou leuest nou?t on godes craft; Swylk felawis wille we nau?t.” “Be stille,” he saide, “broþer Iohan. Whi chyde ?e me euerychone? I am ful wery man for-gone; Me ne list answeri neuer one. But I thanke oure lord god, I sawe hure with flesche and blood, Ther oure ladi to heuene went: Here is þe token þat sche me sent.” Quath seynt Petir, “þat is sothe. This seynt sche hure self wof. We dide it on hure in þe beere; Wonder me þinkeþ þat it is here. Go we swiþe in to þe vale, To wite þe sothe of þis tale That he haþ vs here yseide, For it was in þe tumbe ylaide.” Oute of þe place swiþe þei ?ede, And þe tumbe þei vndede; No þing þer Inne þei ne founde, But a manere floure at þe grounde. That floure was ‘manna’ yclepid; Hit was in þe tumbe ystekyd. Thei ?eden alle abowte þe tumbe And knelede on þe bare grounde, And seiden, “ihesu, godes sone, Al þi sonde be welcome. My?tful art þou, heuene kynge; That mai we wite bi þis tokenynge; For no man mai wite ne se What is þi derne priuete.” Cryst of heuene, þat is so bry?t, Amonge þe apostles sone he ly?t, And gret hem alle yfere, With aungeles fele þat with him were, And seide, “now pees be with vs! Blessed be ?e,” seide Ihesus. A ly?t cloude come after þan, And ouer sprad hem euery man, And bar hem alle þat ben þere, In to here stedes þer þei preched ere; And fonden alle þat folke ?ete, Sittand stille atte here fete. And þei bigonne for to preche, And þe folke for to teche. Moche wondre hem þo þou?t How þei weren þidre brou?t. Mi?tful art þou, heuene kynge, Ihesu Crist, in alle þinge! The apostles kneled in þat stede; To ihesu þei bede a bede. Ihesu herde here praiere, For þei were him leue and dere. We biseche þee for alle þat hereþ þis vie Off oure ladi seynt marie, That Ihesu schelde hem fram grame, Fro dedly synne and fro schame. Ne mys auenture schal bi falle þat man That þis a vie here can. Ne no womman þat ilke dai That of oure ladi hereþ þis lai, Dien ne schal of hure childe, For oure ladi hure schal be mylde. Ne none mys auenture schal be-falle In felde, in strete, ne in halle, In stede þer þis vie is rad, For oure ladi hure sone it bad. And þe archibisshop seynt Edmound Haþ graunted xl. daies to pardoun To alle þat þis vie wol here Or with good wille wol lere. Ihesu, for þi modre loue, That woneþ in heuene vs aboue, Graunt vs, ?if þi wille is, The mochil Ioye of paradis! A praier þer-to seie alle we, A Pater noster pur charite, And an Aue marie þer-to, That Ihesus vs graunt so. Amen! Celi regina sit scriptori medicina.</field>
