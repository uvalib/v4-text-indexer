      <field name="fulltext">Prima velim teneris intendat amoribus ætas, Et canat ad Cytharam nostra camena suam. Molle meum Leuibus cor est penetrabile telis, Et semper causa est cur ego semper amo. Vitantur venti, pluuiæ, vitantur, et estus, Non vitatur amor, mecum tumuletur oportet. TO THE MOST GODLY, VERTVOVS, BEAVTIFVLL, and accomplished PRINCESSE, meritoriously dignified with all the Titles Religion, Vertue, Honor, Beautie can receiue, challenge, afforde, or deserue; ANNA, by diuine prouidence, of Great Britane, France, and Ireland, Queene: Alexander Craige wisheth all health, wealth, and royall felicitie. To the Queene her most excellent Maiestie. Apelles man did all his Wits imploy To paint the shape of Lædais Daughter faire: But when he saw his worke prou'd naught, poore Boy, He wept for woe, and tooke exceeding care: Then deck'd he her with Iewels rich and rare: Which when the braue Apelles did behold. Paint on (quoth hee) poore Boy, and haue no feare, When Beautie fayles, well done t'enrich with Gold, I am (faire Princesse) like the Painters man, As ignorant, as scant of skill as hee: Yet will J striue and doe the best J can, To manifest my louing minde to thee. But to supply the weaknesse of my skill, In place of Gold (great Lady) take goodwill. Craige. Amorous Songes and Sonets. TO IDEA. In Golden world, when Saturne did vpgiue To Pluto, Joue, and Neptune, his Empire They cast their lots both how, &amp; where to liue, Because it was old Saturns owne desire: Joue ruld the Furnace farre aboue the Fire, The stately Vault, beyond the starrie round: And Neptune gat the glassie Salt to hyre, Then Pluto chooss'd the Hellish blacke profound: When Cupid spied they gaue him but the Ground; Impatient wagg, went out to walke abrod, And conquering these that were but lately cround, He made him selfe ouer all those Gods a God. Then Loue to thee, as to my Lord I yeeld, I feare to fight, where Gods haue fled the feeld. Omnia vincit amor, et nos cedamus amorj. To IDEA. Downe fr? the Skies for to behold my Dame Came Goddesses, and all the Gods aboue: Joue, Saturne, Mars, bright Phœbus, and with thame, Rich Juno, Minerue, and the Queene of Loue: Her beauties fame, their mindes did so commoue, They run, and tooke no rest till they came thare, Thus armies proud, approch't for to approue, And giue their doome, that she was matchles faire: Loue like the rest, would faine look'd on, &amp; sweare Vnknit (faire Dame) this Craip, quoth he, &amp; thou Both Bagg and Bow a bonie while shalt beare, Shoote where thou wilt, and I shall well allow: They change, &amp; she shot Loue, that he was faine To skarfe his eyes, and begge the Bow againe. Cæcus amor superos superat, lithocardia amorem. To LITHOCARDIA. Of late the blind, and naked Archer Boy, A libertine, out through the plains would play With ayre-deuiding wings without conuoy: Hee vaging went, and wist not where away. Sad Uenus wep't, and thus to mee can say. Didst thou behold my blind Babe any whare? For hee is gone; O pittie strange estray: And he is fightles, syndonles, and bare: In Craigs and Rocks such Elu's doe make repare, And so perhaps hee harbers in thy hart. It was too true, yet durst I not declare His beeing there, for feare of further smart. To want her Babe, braue Venus stil doth murne, she drown's the world with teares, &amp; yet I burne. Hic mihi quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis. To LITHOCARDIA Loue set his Bow, his Bag, and Bolts aside, And went out through the watrie vaults of ayre Disposd to play; he goes without a guyde, And with the Winds he wauers heere and thare: Till at the last a fleeting Castle faire On smooth and glassie Seas hee doth espie: Hee bords their Barke, the fishing craft to leare: The poore men yeeldes, not daring to denie, Hee hales their Hookes, and baites them by &amp; by. Then Thetis rose, and ask'd if Loue would burne The liquid seat wherein her Lord did ly, Disswading him from such a cruell turne. Feare not sayd Loue, I came to fish, thou sees, And left my flames in Lithocardias eyes. O non humano nata puella toro. To CYNTHIA. The Hobbie Haulke can catch at all no pray, Vnles aboue her ayme and marke she flie. The Palme doth beare the brauer boughs some say From neighbour trees, the higher that it bee. So far'd of those my fansies fond and mee, In hope of hap, I cannot cease to sore. If loued, I liue: and if disdain'd, I die. I pray, I prayse, I pleade, and I implore: Proud Cytherea loued Adonis poore, And Cynthia seru'd Endimion Sheepheard swane; So though I be in glorious and obscure, Yet may she loue her Poet and her Man. Mount then braue thoughts through water, fire &amp; aire And desp'rately pursue the sweete, proud, faire. Blanditiis amor est, et succo mollior omni. To PANDORA. Since Joue him selfe was subiect vnto Loue, And left the lift to catch a mortall pray. If Neptune did from glassie Seas remoue, And would for Loue, aside the Scepter lay. If Pluto loath'd his darke and pitchie Caue, To spoyle Proserpine Ceres Daughter faire. If proude Apollo Daphni deare to haue, Left Phaeton to rule his fyrie Chaire. If shaghhaird Satyrs mountaine-climing race, Pursu'd Ænona through the Phrygian Woods. If piping Pan from Musicke sweete did cease, To hunt the Naiad Nymp's by bankes of Floods? What can I doe (sweet haart) but loue thee still? On whom nor Gods nor men can gaze their fill. Iussit amor, quis enim magno non cedat amorj, In cignum, in pluuiam qui iubet ire Jouem. To ERANTINA. Nor there where as the yoaked restles Horse With Phaeton begins their wonted race, and leads their Lord throughout the lift perforce To circumgire the Earth into each place. Nor there where as the hot and fyrie face, The burning beames of Phæbus bright appeare, When hee diuyds the day in equall space With glorious rayes in his meridian Spheare. Nor there, whereas Apollo proude, for feare Our comming night, his lingering should controle With speedie pace from our Horizon heare, Is headlong hurl'd to view th' antarticke Pole. Nor no where els can any match at all be found to her; whose vertues makes me thrall. Tu mihi sola places. To ERANTINA. O wounder to the world, wh? woundering eyne Doe wounder still as on the rarest fight Of Natures frame; yet come to common light, Or Hemisphere, where our Horizon beene. Sweete louely Laura, modest, chast, and cleene. It seemes that Poet Potrarche tooke delight, Thy spotles prayse in daintie lines to dight, By Prophecies, before thy selfe was seene. And now faire Dame, since thou art borne to bee That Comet strange, and that prodigious Starre, Whence life and death, and peace &amp; bloody warre: And calme and storme proceed, as pleaseth thee: Shine still, and still with sweete aspect infuse, Eternall theame, and matter to my Muse. At mea cum multis placuisset musa puellis, Huic unj, dixj, noster inheret amor. To IDEA. The chastest Child will oft for mercie cry, And bid the striker stay and hold his hand: Yea though he weepe, his teares he will vpdry And kisse (suppose against his will) the wand, With chiuering chin, but sturring will he stand, And patiently suppres his present paine: Poore Babe he dare not but obey command, And hold his peace, least he be lasht againe. Such is my state, I saikles soule am slaine, Nor can I get the smallest graunt of grace, Nor dare I now, though I haue cause, complaine: And though I durst, my plaints wold haue no place Thus am I faine for feare of further wrong, Euen with the Babe to burst, and hold my tong. Non tamen audebam tacitos operire dolores, Ingenium metuens casta puella tuum. To CINTHIA It sometime chanst, as Stories tell by chanse; That Hercules and Hylas were alone, And seuerally they went apart to panse: But hee and hee, accompanied with none, Till Hercules to Hylas made his mone, That hee for drouth was like to giue the Ghost. Thus Hylas to Ascanius Blood is gone, To draw a drinke, and lowting life hath lost. So when mine eyes had spurd a speedie post, To set the floods of fauour to their friend, My burning heart, which drouth of comfort crost, They dround them selues, &amp; nothing els obteind: So Destanies my dolefull death concludes, By double force of Furious flames and floudes. Uror, et heu nostro manat ab igne liquor. To IDEA. The Lipper man, whose voyce can not be hard, With dolefull hoarse vnpleasant tune wil cry, And craue for loue of Iesus Christ reward, And alm's of such as chaunce for to passe by: But when (allace poore soule) he doth espy That no man heares, not yet regards his voyce, No longer then takes he delight to ly, But claps his dish, and keepes his language close. Right so as curst, and carefull is my Crosse, Suppose the Fates haue not deform'd my shape, No words I vse for to lament my lose, But make my Lines to be the Lippars Clap. Goe Sonet then and beg, I thee beseech, Some grace to him, whom feare deterres from speech. Dicere quæ puduit scribere iussit amor. To IDEA. In stately Troy which was by force of fire Subdu'd in end, and turnd in embers cold, Apollo's Church while Priam did empire, Was beautifull and braue for to behold: In midst whereof hung in a net of gold A Cocarrice, that Spider, Bird, nor Flie, To enter there, nor build durst not be bold: That famous worke from filth was kept so frie. The like (faire Dame) may well be thought of thee For why, before thy beauties Altar hings, Canceld with prid, both blood and birth I see, With cold disdaine, which serue as certaine sings, To warne a farre my fancie to refraine, And rather wrake then once reueale my paine Cor dolet gelidus torpet sub pertore sanguis, Me tamen oppressum dicere vetat amor. To PANDORA. I panse not on the gold of Tagus sand, Nor Erithrean braue and shyning shells: I long not for the limits large of Land, Wherein the barbar newfound Nations dwels: I bid not of these bounds whose boosome swells With birth of braue and costly Iewels rare, Which with their Muske and Siuet sweetest smels In fairest Chartons, set perfume the ayre. My pridles Hart subdued with Loue and feare, Seekes that those Songes the Heralds of my hart Might mooue the sweet and flintie harted faire Some fauour once, and pittie to impart: Els that vpon the Alter of her wreath, She would accept th' oblation of my death. At sine te regum Munera nulla volo: To PENELOPE. I serue a Mistris infinitely faire, And (which I more esteeme) exceeding wise, In that, beyond the boundes of all compare: And this in her the wondering world enuies, Thence doth of loue my restles rage arrise, Thence flowes the font of all the harmes I haue: Her wit my heart, her beautie charm'd mine eyes, To Venus thus and Pallas I am slaue: If curious heades to know her name do craue, Shee is a Lady Rich, it needes no more, And wealthy Iuno wonted pride may leaue, And gladly serue the Dame whom I adore: Rich, wise, and faire, to thee alone as thrall, I consecrate loue, life, lines, thoughts, and all. At mihi seruitium, et tristis iam vita paratur, Illaq; libertas pristina surripitur. To PENELOPE. Short is the day, but long (allace) to mee, Who liue in loue, and am not loued againe: My louely, faire, and loueles Saint I see, Doth guild with gold her hid &amp; coy disdaine. thinkst thou faire dame, to buy my loue with gaine Cause thou art rich, I pray thee thinke not so: I am thy slaue, and for thy sake am slaine. Nor can my Rim's reueale my inward woe. Put now a poynt Pænelopæ I pray, vnto this web so oft retex'd by thee, Pay loue with loue, and make no more delay: O raine no more thy shewers of gold on mee, One kisse of thee would breed me more content Then make me king of Cresus Lydian rent. To LITHOCARDIA. By Anagram. When Churches all of Asia les and more, By Xerxes great were burnt, &amp; cast to ground Of pittie hee Dianais Church forbore. A peece of worke whose like could not be found: And yet by fames report to be renound, Herostratus did set the same on fire, Which Xerxes great suppose a Monarch cround, Did spare vnspoyld for all his proud Empire. Right so, when as so many did conspire To conquer mee a poore and Cuntrey Swaine, My hardned hart withheld their hot desire, And I till now, vnconquerd did remaine. That by my losse, I must enlarge thy fame, And slay my selfe to serue a glorious Dame. Non ego seruitium Dominæ tam mite recuso, Ab pereat si quis vincula et ipse times. To LITHOCARDIA. Anagram. As Marigould did in her Garden walke, One day, O ten times happie was that day I thitherward to see my Saint, did stalke: Where Floraes Imp's ioy'd with her feet to play, And loe vnseene behind a Hedge I lay, Where I beheld the Roses blush for shame, The Lillies were empald vpon the spray, The Violets were staynd about my Dame: My Mistris smild for to behold the game, And sometimes pleasd vpon the grasse to sport. Which canging hew's new cullors did acclaime, For blythnes of so sweete a Saincts resort, And from that walke while as away she went. They weepe with deaw, &amp; I in teares lament. Spreuit nostras galatea querelas. To KALA. Faire Kala, fairer then the Wooll most faire, Of these my faire and siluer fleeced Sheepe Which are committed to my careles care, And vp and downe those daintie Dales I keepe: Faire Sheppeardesse, for thee alone I weepe. None heares my plaints but bleating beasts and I, And for thy sake I sigh when I should sleepe, And on thy name amid my dreames I crie. Th? since thou know's the thraldome of my mind And how my necke to beare thy yoke is worne: Haue pittie once, and proue not ay vnkind, And laugh no more thy shepheard swaine to scorne But if thou mind'st for to remead my mone, Let fansies then, flocks, folds, and all, be one.

What euer thou be that claimes or courts my deare And in my absence would supply my place, If courts thou, I pray thee to forbeare, Rob not my right, and latelie granted grace: For if at were, I friendly craue thy case, And thou had credit as I sometime bade, Were it not wrong, if I should proudlie prease To raue thy right? yes I may surely saide: Be who thou wilt, I challenge thee therefore, That with thy Daffings deauis my Lais eare; Cease from thy sute, and in to time forbeare, Els we can be companions true no more. For put the case thou speed, thou gaines these two, A facill Dame, and of a friend a foe. Casta mane nec te lusus, nec munera vincant. To LAIS. Even as a ventering Merchant skant of skill, Whom Fortunes trowne or fate hath forc'd to fall To recempence his former losse hee will Within one Ship and Vessell venter all. So haue I vsed my Stocke, though it be small: My Hart I send halfe dround into dispaire Vnto my Saint, whom euer serue I shall: Shee is the Shipp, and it the ventered ware. Oft hath my minde bin cloy'd with clouds of care When contrar winds, with cold and stormie raine would threat my losse; but now fr? bounds of feare My ventring thus, hath made me rich againe. Then shal my Muse triumph &amp; mourne no more, Since second windes haue brought my Shipp to shore. At nunc tota tua est, te solum candida secum, Cogita et frustra credula turba sedet. To PANDORA. O watchfull Bird proclaymer of the day, Withhold I pray, thy piercing notes from me: Yet crow, and put the Pilgrime to his way, And let the Worke-man rise to earne his fee: Yea let the Lion fierce, be feard of thee, To leaue his prey, and lodge him in his Caue: And let the deepe Diuine from dreaming flie, To looke his leaues within his close Conclaue: Each man saue I, may some remembrance haue, That gone is night, and Phosphor draweth nie: Beat not thy breast for mee poore sleepeles slaue, To whom the Fat's alternall rest denie: But if thou wouldst bring truce vnto my teares, Crow still for Mercie in my Mistris eares. To PANDORA. Go you o winds that blow from north to south, Conuey my secret sighes vnto my sweet: Deliuer them from mine, vnto her mouth, And make my commendations till we meet. But if perhaps her proud aspiring sprit, Will not accept nor yet receiue the same, The brest and bulwarke of her bosome beit: Knock at her hart, and tell from whence you came, Importune her, nor cease, nor shrinke, for shame: Sport with her curl's of Amber cullour'd haire, And when she sighs, immix your selues with thame Giue her her owne, and thus beguile the faire. Blow winds, flie sighs, where as my hart doth hanc And secretly commend me to my sanct. To PANDORA. In Arcadie sometime (as Sydne say's,) Demagoras a proud Lord did remaine, In whom no thing I marke that merits prayse, Saue that he seru'd Parthenia sweet with paine: But when he found she lou'd him not agane, With leprocie he did infect her face, Which caus'd the constant knight for to complane But not to change his loue in any case: Pandora faire his woose infect'd allace With leprocie of loathsome cold disdane, Bred by my foe, to further my disgrace: Yet neither fayth nor fancie shall refrane: Yea, were her face deform'd as it is faire, I should ay serue, though I should ay dispaire. Fortuna potes inuita fecisse beatum, Quem velis. To LITHOCARDIA. A very World may well be seene in mee, My hot desires as flames of Fire do shine, My sighes are ayre, my teares the Ocean sea My steadfast fayth, the solid Earth, &amp; syne, My hope my heauen, my thoughts are stars diuine My ielosie the very pangues of Hell, My sweete the Sainct, to whom I do propine For sacrifice my seruice and my sell. That hatefull Hagge, who neere my Dame doth dwell My riuall foe, my Loue the Sommer sweet, My Spring-time, my deserts which so excell, And my Dispaires, the Winter cold and weet. But (O allace) no Haruest can I see, Which spoyls my yeares, &amp; maks me thus to die To ERANTINA. Well may I read as on a snowie sheet Of paper faire, my fortune in thy face, Since at my sight thine eyes are both repleit, With loueles looks presaging but disgrace: And thou into my visage wann allace, May see in sad characters of my care, Since neither ruth nor pittie can haue place, A boundles Booke, a volume of dispare. Thus like a Glasse my face may well declare My loue to thee, and with my loue my paine: Thine show's againe (though it be matchles faire) Thy hatefull heart and vndeseru'd disdaine. O antipathie strange to be susteind, I loue my foe, thou hats thy faithfull friend. Vidi ego quæ veneris fallendo iura resesuit, Perfidiæ penas sæpe luisse graues. To IDEA. The Brethren three whose hot persut hath broght Death to them selues, &amp; bondage to their land, When as their foe before them fled, they thoght The victorie was plac'd into their hand: And yet his flight inferd no feare they fand, For as they came, hee slew them one and one. A Parthian forme, whose fight in fight doth stand, For while they flie, their foes are kild anone. Euen so may I, vnhappiest I complaine: But pittie thus to serue a Parthian Dame, Who shuns my sutes, and makes my fancie fane, With hosts of harm's for to pursue the same. O sweet discord, O sweet concord agane, She flies to kill, I chase her to be tane. To IDEA. Faire louelie Hæbæ Queene of pleasant Youth, Who bore braue Nectar to the Gods aboue: Whose glansing beames like Phæbus in the south, Do both bewitch and burne my brest with loue. O thou that wars the woundring world for woorth Whom Nature made to laugh her selfe to scorne, More excellent then I can set thee soorth: Whose like nor is, nor shall againe be borne. My flowing Songs I consecrate to thee, Good reason were, that they should all be thine. Thy presence creats all those thoughts in mee, Which mee immortall, and maks thee diuine: And such delight I haue with thee to stay, As twentie Moones do seeme but halfe a day. Et tua quod superest temporis esse precor. To LITHOCARDIA. Thou who began by Menalus to mone, And lay alone for to lament thy losse Amid those greene and grouie shads to grone Where Musidonus knew thee by thy voyce: Thou hast of me a comfort in thy crosse, With Princes proud if poore men may compare, For why my cares suppose I keepe them close, Ouermatcheth thine, tho thy mishaps were mare: Thy thuartring thoughts were dro?d in deepe dispare Mine haue no hope for to be brought to pas: Thy heart has hurt, and mine of blis is bare: Thou chang'd thy shape, I am not what I was: In end thou sped, I ware my worke in vaine, I loue allace, and am not loued againe.

The Persian King in danger to be dround, Ask'd if no helpe in humane hands did stand, The Skipper then cast in the Salt profound, Some Persians braue, &amp; brought the King to land. Then Xerxes crowns the Skipper with his hand, Who saues the King deseru's (quoth he) a crowne: But he at once to kill him gaue command, Die die, said he, who did my Persians drowne. My Ladie faire, a Xerxes proud doth proue, My worthles Verse she doth reward with gold: But (O allace) she lets me die for loue, And now I rew that I haue bin so bold. As Xerxes crownd, and kild his man; right so Shee seemes a frind, and proues a mortall foe. Credula res amor est &amp;c. At IDEAS direction, these two Sonets were made. I. More then I am, accursed mought I bee, If er'e I did approch my dearest Dame: But such a great respect was still in mee, As ay feare was equall to my flame: Suppose some sots spoyld of the sense of shame, Or feeling of my honest Loue, will say, And publiklie to my dispraise proclame That I delight in loathsome Lust as thay. You sacred pow'rs, I still inuoke and pray, That all my speach turne poyson in a clap, If either I by word or writ bewray One lusting thought her beautie to entrap, Let pale Enuie (faire Dame) admire and lie, With chast desiers I serue and honor thee. To IDEA. 2 VVith chast desires I serue and honor thee Great Archi-mistris of my rauisht mind, Most virtuous, wise, and faire, of all thy kind: Whose least command I vow to doe or die. Chast was my Loue, yet is, and ay shall bee, The praysing Papers which I haue propin'd, May well beare witnes how I am inclind, And can (ye know) controull mee when I lie: Phronesis erring could espie no place, Meete on this mould, but in thy breast to dwell, A virtuous mind adorns a beauteous face; And thou hast both, and in them both excell: This maks my loue be chast, my passions strange And I had rather choose to die then change, Aspice diuinas humano in corpore dotes Nil mortale tibi fæmina digna polo es. To CYNTHIA. Hadst thou been blacke, or yet had I been blind, my muse had slept, &amp; none had known my mind Or yet couldst thou as thou art faire, be kind, I had not thus with sighs increast the wind: But loe these frowning fauours which I find, To which allace thou art too much inclind, By which thy poore afflicted man is pind, Haue broke the heart, which beautie first did bind: Smile then faire dame, &amp; some time cease to frown For smiles please mee, and do become thee best: And since thou sees how I am sworne thine owne, Smile still on him who loues thee by the rest, So neither shall I wish thee to be blacke, Nor curse my eyes, the causers of my wrecke.

The Tyrant Nero houering to behold The wrack of Rome on top of Tarpe hill, He saw the rich, the poore, the young, the old, Amid the flams in in present poynt to spill: Yet woondering on that woonder, stood he still, And (cruell man) would neither mend nor meene, But tooke his pleasure to espie their ill, And smild to see them smart before his eyne: But had that man, that monstruous man yet beene Reseru'd on life by fatall Nimphs till now, To view these flames which may in me be seene, He would bewaile my poore estate I trow, whose boyling breast euen like mont Ætna burns When in his tomb the roaring monster turns. To KALA. The Persian Kings all waters did abiure, Saue those which flow'd fr? faire Choaspes flood: From age to age this they obseru'd as sure, As though no Waters els could do them good. This was a forme, no rather bondage strange, which by no means these Monarch's braue would change. I am as constant as a Persian King, And thou more deare then meat or drinke to meet For all th' entisments beautie bright can bring, With lisping toong, and soull entising eye: In spight of all these all as I began, I am thy true and neuer-changing man. Thus will I surfet on thy beautie braue, And Lyzard-like liue on thy looks diuiue: In presence absence I am sworne thy slaue, And still I would (were I a King) be thine: And for thy sake, till life and breath endure, All other loue and seruice I abiure.

Even as a man by darke that goes astray, Would faine behold and looke vnto the light: Or as a Pilgrem erring from the way, In wildsome wayes, would faine be set a right: As Mariners in blacke and stormie night, O'reset with Seas, strange winds, and stormie raine Longs to behold the beames of Phæbus bright, That after storme, the calme may come againe: As he whom still the Iayler doth detaine In bondage close, of freedome would be glade: Right so shall I of presence be as faine, To see the Sainct for whom my sighs are shade, Light, wisshed way, calme, freedome, should not bee So sweete to them, as Presence vnto mee.

Sore is my head and sorie is my hart, And yet for all th' emplasters I applie, No helpe hath Nature, nor no ayde brings Art, Without, within, I burne, I fret, I frie: A childish thing when Care doth come to crie: Yet this doth most my Feuer fell infect, I hid my harms, and so in silence die, And thus my head must riue, my hart must breake, But worst of all, while visage wan bewray, What secret site my sicke soule doth assale, How I or'edriue in deadly dooll the day, And how this long some Equinoct I vale: Shee cruell shee that should my Surgeon bee, Allow's my losse, and laughs, and lets me die.

Shine then vpon my parched Sunburnd braine, Chiefe stay of all my tempest-beaten state: Leaue not thy man disconsolate againe, Faire Goddes of my Fortune both and Fate: All earthly hopes for thee since I refuse, Be thou my hope, my Mistris, and my Muse.

Ovtthrough the faire and famous Scythian land, A Riuer runns vnto the Ocean mane: Hight Hypanis with cleare and cristall strand, Borderd about with Pine, Firre, Oake, and plane: Whose siluer streames as they delight the eye, So none more sweet to either tast or smell. Yet Exampeus erre his Lord he spies, Maks him to stinke like Stigian stanks at Hell. Eu'n so faire Dame (whose shap doth so excell) Thy glorious rayes, thy shining virtues rare, No Poets pen, nor Rhetors tong can tell So farre beyond the bounds of all compare: Yet are they spoyld with poysning cold disdaine And such as drink thy beauties floods are staine.

Thus am I still twixt Loue and Fortune slaine, I neither take nor tarrie to be taine. To LITHOCARDIA. Good cause hadst thou Euarchus to repent, The reakles rashnes of thy bad decreit: Thy crueltie did spring from good intent, The grounds whereof were tedious to repeet: Yet when thy Sonne fell downe before thy feet, And made thine eyes confesse that he was thine, Thou wept for woe, yet could thou not retreat The sentence said, but sigh'd and sorow'd sine: So may it be that once those eyes diuine, Which now disdaine and loath to looke so low, As to behold these miseries of mine, shal weepe wh? they my constant trueth shal know And thou shalt sigh (though out of time) to see, By thy decret thine owne Pirocles die.

And to repay my loue, my zeale, my fayth, Said, to thy captiue thou wast but a thrall: And when I would for comfort on thee call, Be true to mee deare to my soule, said I, Then sweetly quhespering would thou say, I shall: And echo-like deare to my soule, replie: But breach of fayth now seemes no fault to thee, Old promises new periuries do proue. Apes turse the whelps they loue from tree to tree And crush them to the death with too much loue. My too much loue I see hath chang'd thee so, That from a friend thou art become a foe. Carminibus celebrata meis formosa Neæra, Aterius mauult esse puella viri. To LAIS. Sweet Lais, trust me, I can loue no more, And which is worse, my Loue is turnd to hate: Thou art vnkind, and woe is mee therefore, Inconstant fals and to my griefe ingrate, It is too true I lou'd thee well of late, And euen as true thou lou'dst mee well againe: I haue allace, no pleasure to repeat Our wishes and our vowes since all are vaine: What resolutions and what plots prophane Wee two haue had in loue to liue and die, The time, the place, the tokens giuen and tane; If they could speake, can thy accusars bee: But since thou still art false (I must confesse) Thy loue was lightlie won, and lost for lesse. Ah crudele genus nec fidum fœmina nomen. To ERANTINA. Blind naked loue, who breeds those stormy broyls Which from my deare me to my dole debars: To mee the pangs, to thee pertaine the spoyls: Thou taks aduantage of our ciuill warres, I liue exild, but thou remains too neare, Yet like a tirant shee triumphs o're thee. Her presence maks thee more then blind I heare: And absence is farre worse then death to mee, Could I as thou, from ielous eyes be free, Then should I be as blith as thou art blind: I should not then dispaire, nor wish to die, Nor should my sighs increas the wauering wind. O rigor strange since Loue must still remaine, In presence blind, and I in absence slaine. Una dies tantum est, qua te non femina vidi, Et sine iam videor sensibus esse nescis To PENELOPE. When stately Troy by subtill Sinons guile, And Grecian force was brought to last decay, Ulisses braue with faire and facund stile, Achilles Arm's obtaind, and went away: In Afrike yet he was constraind to stay: For when his friends did taste of Lotus trie, As Homers works do more at length bewray, They green'd no more the Greekish soyle to see. So fares with mee, O most vnhapie mee, Since I beheld thy faire and heauenlie hew, The glorious rayes of thy all conquering eye, My rendering heart and soule did so subdew, That for thy sake, whom euer serue I shall, I haue forgot my selfe, my soyle, and all.

Each thing allace, presents and lets mee see. The rare Idea of my rarest Dame, Deepe sunke into my soule the verie same, Whose view doth still bewitch vnhappie mee, The shining Sunne, her hart transpersing eye. The morning red her braue and blushing shame, Night absence, and day presence doth proclame, foule wether frowns, &amp; calme sweet smil's may bee My scalding sighs tempestious winds, and raine: But exhalations of my tragick teares, In frost allace, her cold disdaine appeares; In thaw, and fire, my melting heart agane: And thus each thing brings purpose to be pinde And to my thoughts c?mends the faire vnkind. To PANDORA. Deare to my soule, and wilt thou needs be gone, And leaue thy Man behind thee but a heart? Is this the pittie which thou dost impart, Disconsolat to let me die alone? Thou hast two harts; mine, thine, and I haue none: Heere springs the surse of my ensuing smart; Yet play I pray the gentle Pyrats part, And as thou lou's my life, yet leaue me one: But brooke them both I gladlie grant and stay, How canst thou ride in raging raine and wind? Yet thou must goe, and woe is me away: Then take my heart, and leaue me thine behind. I gaue thee mine, O then giue thine to mee, That mine and thine be one twix mee &amp; thee. Una fides, unus lectus, et unus amor. To LAIS. I haue compard my Mistris many time To Angels, Sun, Moone, Stars, &amp; things aboue: My Conscience then condem'd me of a crime, To things below when I conferd my Loue: But when I find her actions all are vane, I thinke my Rimes and Poyems all protane. With perfect eyes her Pageants I espy, To no thing now can I compare my Dame, But Theramenes shoo; the reason why, It seru'd each foote: and she can do the same: She hears the sutes of rich, poore, great, &amp; small, And has discretion to content vs all. Si vitium leuitas, nulla puella bona est. To PANDORA. Faine would I goe, and faine would I abide, Sweet Hais agene, and kisse me erre I go, Denie mee not since there is none beside, No teltale here, though thou wouldst giue me two: Yet giue me one, if thou wilt giue no mo; But one is none, then giue mee two or three, Thy Balmie breath doth still bewitch me so, As I must haue an other kisse, or die, Thy Rubent blush now bids take leaue of thee: Faine would I goe, and I would kisse as faine, Then giue me one, or change a kisse with mee: If neither giue nor change, take all againe: When thine &amp; mine are thus conturb'd, I kno Thou canst but smile, that I deceiu'd thee so.

While fierce Achilles at the siedge of Troy, (the fatall Nimphs had so decreed) was slaine A sodaine strife arose who should enioy The Armes of that praise-worthie Grecian: Aiax alleg'd he should the Arm's obtaine, And by the sword to win and weare them vow'd, Ulisses said, they should be his againe: And he them gaind, if Stories may be trow'd, But lo the shield by Sea's was loosd, wee read, And by a storme driu'n from Vlisses sight, And rould to Aiax graue, though he was dead, To show the world that he had greatest right: So when my tombe shal end those teares of mine there shalt thou sigh &amp; say, I should been thine. Tum flebit cum mi senserit esse fidem. To CINTHIA. Oft haue I ment with Musicke, sleepe, &amp; wine, The soueraine cur's for superficiall cares, For to reuiue this wounded heart of mine, And free my selfe from sorow, sighs, and teares: Yet neither all, nor any one of those, Haue force to end, or cure, or change my woes: My griefs are growne to such confused force, No number rests for more, nor place for worse. If I had merit to be martird still, And with the furie of thy frowns abus'd, I could digest thy gloomings with goodwill, And neither looke nor craue to be excus'd: I loue my Rod like Moses; but if I Perceiue it proue a Serpent, I must flie. If thou wilt bind me still to be thine owne, Smile stil (faire Dame) if not, I pray thee frowne. Uincuntur molli pectora dura prece. To LITHOCARDIA. False Eriphile sometime did betray Facidic wise Amphiaraus her spouse, (Who willing from the Theban warres to stay) To hide himselfe secure at home he trow's: Thus while his driftes Adrastus disallow's, She (knowing that her husband should be slaine At Thebes) for a golden chaine auow's To tell Adrastus where he did remaine; And thus reueald, he goes against his will, But leaues Alcmeon to reuenge his wrack On Eriphile, which he did fulfill, When dolefull newes of fathers death came backe So since in loue thou art so vnloyall so long, Some strange Alcmeon must reuenge my wrong.

When Cressid went from Troy to Calchs tent, and Greeks with Troians were at skirmidg hot Then Diomed did late and aire frequent Her companie, and Troil was forgot: Thou lay alone, such was allace thy lot, And Paris brookt poore Menela thy Dame, Shee twind in two the matrimoniall knot, And tooke a stranger when thou went from hame. Such is my case, if I may say for shame, I florisht once; once there was none but I: I once was lou'd, and I haue lost the same, And as God liu's, I know not how nor why: So that my Sainct for falshood I am sure, May match the Grecian or the Troian whore.

Oft haue I sworne; oft hast thou pray'd me too No more to loue, nor more to looke on thee: Since looks and loue haue made so much adoo Twixt loueles thee, and vnbeloued mee: Yet were I dam'd without redres to die, I can not cease from seruing thee faire Dame: Yea thou and all the woondering world shall see The fayth, the force, the furie of my flame, Most like vnto the questing Dogge am I, Who still doth on his angry Maister fawne, While thou corrects, I kindly quest and cry, And more thou threats, the more I am thine owne Thus loue or loath, or cherrish mee or chide, Where once I bind, but any breach I bide.

My riuall foe against all right enioyes That Crowne &amp; Kingdome which pertains to me That proud vsurper worker of my noyes, Shall find a foe, vnto the day I die, And were we dead, that are too long aliue, Our Ashes in th' exequial vrne would striue.

Go then aback, this Barke shall not imbrace The smallest one whom Loue at fead hath borne. (Gh.) That shall I not, for lo before thy face, I shall ou'r saile the flood and thou had sworne: The Darts of Loue both Boat &amp; Oares, shal bee, Sighs shall be winds, and Teares a Styx to mee. An other Dialogue to the same purpose. Ghost. Come Charon come. (Ch.) Who cals? (Gh.) a martyrd man, Since Fame foorthtold the fairest faire was deid. (Ch.) What seeks thou? (Gh.) Help to croce thy waters wan, And I will pay thee for thy paines with speed. (Ch.) Thou seems to be a quick &amp; liuing leid, And not a vmber, not a palled Ghaist. (Gh.) Feare not for that, since I for passage pleid, But let mee haue thy helping hand with haist. (C.) Though sage Æneas did o're-saile my streame By Sybils helpe, none els must goe againe. (G.) Then thinks thou Charon, to enioy my Dame And stay my voyage from th' Elesian plaine? (C.) Yes surely yes. (G) No Charon thou shalt lie For Loue hath wings, and I haue learnd to flie.

Proud Zeuxis gaue his Pictures all for nought, Such was the loue he to his labors bore, That by no gold nor price they could be bought, And thus saue thanks poore man, he gaind no more I am as poore, and euen as proud as hee, For Loue nor Lines I craue no price from thee. For if thou digne but with a gracious smile, To looke my Lines, and spie how I am pind, And with my toyes the swift wingd time begile, Then am I paide according to my minde: Joues oath was Styx, and Phæbus Daphnes haire; But from hencefoorth I by thy smiles wil sweare.

Canst thou not see those sad and ciuill weairs Which are within the kingdome of my heart, Where Legions of persuing pangs appeairs, My vtter wrake and ruine to impart? Heere burns the fire, there sticks the deadly dart: Here teares me droun, there smoky sighs me smore Here Beauty wounds, there riuals runs athwart, And ielous eyes do pry into each pore: When al these al and thou my wrack contriues, I can not last, and I had twentie liues.

That Colatine did talke in Tarquins tent, His Ladie Lucrece was most chast most faire, Hee afterward had reason to repent, Shee died a deemd adultres in dispaire.

Nought said braue Porus do I now require, But that thou vse me as a King should bee, Thou shalt haue friendly hostage to thy hyre: And for my sake I graunt thy sute (said hee.) Long with my passions haue I borne debate, Oft haue I fought, and now haue lost the feeld, It is my fortune for to be defeate.

VVhen Dionise was shut from Regall seat, And quite deposd from his Imperial throne For tyrannies too tedious to repeate, Which made oft times the Siracusans grone, When he was thus disgrac'd, and left alone: He could not cease to play the tyrant still, He grew a pedant infants poore anone, He taught and quhipt to exercise his ill. I with my Loue haue plaid the licher long, And shee the loun with many moe then mee: This custome vile, maks sinne to seeme no wrong, And she must turne a common Whoore I see, Though both be bad, and each of both vnsure, I rather serue a tyrant then a whoore.

I am content that custome to imbrace; I haue no beard to show my peace with thee: But thou wilt say, my hairs portend disgrace, And discontent is in my downcast eye: It is too true; but let me rise or fall, Or sinke or swim, I am thy seruient thrall.

But now (wise Dame) behold a wonder strange, Which both I wish thee to beleeue and heare: (I am so loath where once I choose, to change) That in my heart thou harbours all this yeare: Then from a Hat I drew thee err I saw thee, Now from my hart it is my doome to draw thee. Why should I hazard what I haue so sure, Or scrape thy name into a scuruie Scrowle?

Nor prayers, nor the prayse which I haue pend for thee, Which makes me thus for to be pind, and thee so proud to bee. This then shall be the last. since first it can not bee; For I haue waird alreadie els a world of words on thee: But worlds Democrit said, were infinite, and so Thou looks to find infinites of worlds of words, or moe: No no; my Poyems haue proclaymd thy prid, my paine, And I am wo that I haue waird so many words in vaine. For I haue dryd the braine of my inuention quit, And neither conquered my desire, nor purchast thy delight. Lo then how I was led with Loue, that Lordly elff, That bred no pleasure vnto thee, nor profet to my selff: But as Phæneus poore for Phisick sought in vaine, And by his foe was cur'd, when as hee hop'd hee had been slaine. So thy disdains haue cur'd my hurt and vlcerd hart, And I am weell against thy will, but sense of old-felt smart.

So thou fals Tyran, thou from turret of thy prid, Thou smild at my mishaps as proud, as braue as Neptuns brid. But woorthy Phocion a Captaine braue and stout, For these vnkind Athenians, fought fourtie Batels out, And yet was slaine by them: and when he died, 'tis told Hee pray'd his Sone for to forgiue his death, for kindnes old. So though I be in poynt by thy disdaine ro die, My heart shall charge my houering hand, to write no ill of thee: For like Themistocles, I rather drinke the Gall, Then fight against my once good friend, though now my loue be small, Then sometime friend, farewell; this is my most reuenge, To thinke no good, to write no ill, but last of all to change.

Olautia poore was glad, when th' Amazon Queene of yore, Receiu'd a Nosegay from her hand, suppose shee smeld no more. Cherillus heart was hois'd to highest heauens hee thought, When Macedo ouer lookt his Lines; suppose hee lik'd them nought. So, if thou take my Verse, a louing poore propine, Which ouer-shadowed with thy sight, throughout the world shall shine. If thou the sheet receiue, though thou vnfold no folds, Yet shall those hidden Lines be blith, whilst thou their backs beholds: And I poore hopeles soule, thy weell affected man, Shall be as blith as Cherill was, or yet Olautia than. Take then my faultles Sheet, bedewd with mourning Inke, And if thou wilt not view my Verse, to know the thing I thinke; Yet shall the Paper serue (O faire and matchles Dame) To be a Bottom to thy Silke, or safftie to thy Seame: But least my mourning Inke like Niobe's blacke tears, Should blacke thy braue Mineruik worke, whilst it thereto adhears, Pine with thy snow-white hand the Verse before thy view, That they may not infect nor foyle the farfet Silks faire hew: And thou shalt see no more set downe before thy face, For to reueale my endles woe, but this one word Allace, Allace, allace, allace, Allace, allace againe, Ten thousand times allace allace, can not expres my paine. Allace I am thine owne, na haue I hap to vew Heraclits flood of change thereby, my nature to renew. None knew of Hercules the poysoning deadly shafts, But Philoctetos; none but I complains conceals thy crafts. Though thou hast faild to mee, I am not false to thee: I am thy Beadman day by day, and bondman till I die. And would to God thou hadst rich Amaltheas horne, To yeeld what fruites thou list, though I liue lightlied and forlorne, Æneas lost at Troy, Creusa faire his wife And through and with ten thousand Greeks hee made a desperat strife: And rooming vp and downe, emboldned with dispaire, Hee cryd aloud Creusa come, but could not find her there, And still he crid, till time her pallid ghost anone Appeard, and gaue him certaine sighs that she was dead and gone. So shall thy soule thy Ghost begin for to remoue, And leaue to be within thy brest, before I leaue to loue: And when thy Ghost is gone, and past th' Elisian lake, No Dido shall complaine of mee, nor suffer for my sake. If Romans did returne in Arms of shining Steell Our Rubicon, then were they deemd foes to the common weell: But my returns to thee, are full of loue and peace, As witnesseth this iterat, and oft said word Allace. If I haue said too much, let mee thy peace implore, And my Epiloge with a sigh I seale and say no more: Protesting since thou knows how I am sworne thine owne, And how thy Vertues by my Verse, throughout the world be known: Thou wilt haue some remorse vpon my carefull case, And let thy Courtasies conclude, my long long-cri'd Allace. To LAIS. The faire faced Woman, and deformed Ape, Hath Nature fram'd to want a taile wee see: The sillie beast with her vnseemelie shape, Seems well content and pleas'd that so should bee: And yet the Woman striueth euen and morne, To haue a taile and still in Naturs scorne. But let it be (for to supplie this want) Each discontented whore should haue one taile, What reason is't (since Nature knew them skant) A pockie Punck with pluralties should deale? This then is true, which I obserue as sure, A Beast hath more discretion, then a Whore. Hac venit in thalamos dote superba tuos. His constant Resolution to ERANTINA. Shall absence long, or distance farr of place, With lowring looks of frem'd vnfriendly foes? Shall tract of time for les or longer space, Haue any force to cause mee change my choyse? No surelie no; I am not one of those: I shall be found no falce nor flitting friend, My loue shall last as long as life suppose, Luck be not such as sometime I haue seen'd: But what remead, I may not mend but meen'd, And with your will I hold mee well content: Though many thwartering things haue interueend To interturb and stay our true intent, Yet all those iarres shall not my minde remoue The day of death shall be the date of loue. Dum paris ænone poterit spirare relicta, Ad fontem xanthi versa recurrat aqua. Confirmation of his loue to ERANTINA. Shall absence long bring change, or make my minde to moue? Or yet shall distaunce farre of place, vnlock the linke of Loue? Shall either this or that, yon, or the other thing, Haue force to breake the blocke we band, before the Paphian King? Thou art mine Hero still, and though the streams be stark, I through the waltering waues shall swim to thee but Boat or Barke, I am not Iasons meat, Mædea to beguile: My fayth is firme, this the cause exponis mee exile. Nor am I come by line of traytor Troians race, I neuer thought no not by dreame, my Dido to disgrace. Nor am I hee who brought the black saill for the white, Least Ariadne kild his syre, and it their wrack was white. A Pyramus I am in deed, in thought, in word, And should (wist I thou wert not weell) with blood imbrew my sword: And if by Fames report thy pains I can perceaue As Hemon did, shall I giue the Ghost abone the graue. No that I looke to find such friendship on thy part, Or promis kept which ay shall be inshrind within my hart: Or that I greeue for grace thy honor to degrade, For if my Sainct be safe and sound, how can I but be glade. In tears as Biblus did, though I consume away, Who was huerted in a Well, as auncient Writers say. And though I be resolued to loue thee tearme of life, Yet must I leaue thee for a while, Ulysses left his wife. My word shall be my word, my kindnes shall be knowne, And with my oath I will no boure, for I am sworne thine owne. And for thy sake I vow the Pilgrems weed to weare, And when in wildsome wayes I walke, the Rod and Bag to beare: And this my hoarie head vnrased shall remaine; A tipe of my continuing trueth, till wee two meet againe. And so with heauie hart, adue my dearest Dame, In happie state long mayst thou liue, till I enuie the same: And would to God thy wealth were such as I would wish. So till the Gods our meetings grant, thy snowie hand I kis. To LAIS. If Rodopæ the loathsome Strumpet vile, Became to be a great Ægyptian Queene, Put not sweet heart thy hop's into exile, Good luck may light vpon a life vncleene: Shee was a Queene, thou must an Emprice bee, For thou art thrise as great a whoore as shee. Cui madidos minxit mentula multa sinus. His vnwilling Farewell to PENELOPE. A frind some time to Thracian Cotys send, In signe of loue, a vessell rich and rare: But back againe before the bearer wend, Hee brake the same in peeces heere and there; Not for contempt, but to preuent my care, I brake this gift which thou hast brought, said hee, For if my seruants breake the fame, I sweare, They should been bate, and I incensed bee. I Cotys-like (proud Dame, to ease my paine, And that thou be not forst to heare my cries) Must leaue to loue; nor shall my Songs againe Thy surfet breed, nor come before thine eyes: Not, that I loath, where I so long did loue, Thou art vnkind, and I must needs remoue. His louing farewell to PANDORA. Deare to my soule once degne, those passions to peruse, The Swan-like Dir'ges and the Songs, of this my deeing Muse; Which are Minerua-like, by beating of my braine, Brought foorth to shew the wondering world, my long suppressed paine: For like the doomb borne sonne of that rich Lydian King, Now at the imminent of death, with toong vntied I sing. Had Atis-like my foe thy wedding day been slaine By Tydeus fearce, then had I brook'd faire Ismene allaine. Or had thou been a man like her whom Phestne bred, Whom Telethusa promest with Jauthe faire to wed. Then had my riuall been as farr from thee as I, Nor had he now, nor thou been iudge to my complaint and cry. As Tantalus did cut poore Pelops corps a sunder, And made a banquet of his Sonne, vnro the Gods rare woonder: Yet did they recollect his cutted Corps againe, And Tantall they condemd to die In hunger staruing paine. So cruell thou hes karu'd ten thousand wayes my hart, And thou indures obdurat still, and senceles of my smart: Yet will the Gods, I hope, recure and purge my paine, And punish all thy cruelties, with cruelties againe. Had I Ixion-like made vaunt of Iunoes spoyle, With patience then I should abide thy furie and this foyle. But since it must be thus, from Athens I will flie, With wise Demosthenes, and then in Neptuns asyll die. Then cruell faire farewell, I may remaine no more, I mind before wee meet againe, to see the Celtin shore. But howsoeuer I err, or wheresoeuer I vaig, In weell, in wo, in want, and wealth, thou shalt command poore Crag: Yea might I make a Feast, as did Democrits sire, To all the Persian troups, ou'r which great Xerxes bore empire. Or were I begging bread like Ithak Irus poore, Whom proud Ulisses with his fist feld dead into the floore. Yea be I rich or poore, or poore and rich againe, At hazards all I am thy man, and so shall ay remaine. Faire Homicid farewell, against my heart I goe, And that al-maker knows I make a voyage full of woe: But euen as Ataris with silence sweet doth slide, And none perceiu's if vp or downe, or whither flows the tide. So none saue thou shall know the caus of all my paine, And none shall know wherefore I goe, nor when I come againe. And so till time wee meet, deare heart, whom I adore: Farewell, yet giue me leaue to sigh, and say, Farewell once more. To his PANDORA from Englaud. Now while amid those daintie Douns &amp; Dales with Shepheard Swains I sit vnknown to mee Wee sweetly sing, and tell pastorall tales: But my discourse and Songs-theame is of thee; For otherwayes allace, how can it be. Let Venus leaue her blest abod aboue To tempt my Loue, yet thou sweet soule shalt see That I thy man, and thou shalt die my loue. No tract of time, nor sad eclipse of place, Nor absence long, which sometime were due cures To my disease, shall make thy slaue to cease From seruing thee till life or breath indures: And till wee meet, my rustick mats and I, Through woods &amp; plains, Pandoras prayse shal cry. To LAIS. Harpaste poore, was blind of either eye, Yet would shee not beleeue that it was so The roomes are darke wherein I dwell, sayd shee, Take mee abrod, and but a guyd I'le go: The wife was led abrod into the wind, And yet poore soule she still continued blind. Thinks thou that change fr? this to yonder place, Can caus thy shame and scandall to decay? No Lais no, I pray thee hold thy peace, And put these fond opinions quite away: For while thy life, or yet my lins endure, The world shall say, thou art a shameles whore. Fæmina nulla bona est, vel si bona contigit vlla, Nescio quo casu res mala facta bonæ est. His faythfull seruice to IDEA. My wandring Verse hath made thee known-all-where Thou known by them, &amp; they are known by mee: Thou, they, and I, a true relation beare: As but the one, an other can not bee; For if it chance by thy disdane I die, My Songs shal cease, and thou be known no more. Thus by experience thou mayst plainly see, I them, thou mee, and they do thee decore. Thou art that Dame whom I shall ay adore In spight of Fortune and the frowning Fate, Whose shining beautie makes my Songs to sore In Hyperbank loftie Reigh conceits: Thou, they, &amp; I throughout the world be known They mine; thou theirs, and last I am thine own. To my Honorable good Lord and Maister (the true Mæcenas of my Muse) George Earle of Dunbar, Lord Barwick, high Tresurar of Sotland. To the Reader. ALEXIS to LESBIA. Come be my Loue, and liue with mee, And thou shalt all the solace see, That glassie gulfs or earth can bring, From Uesta's wealth, or Neptuns reigne. For we shall on the Mountains go, In shaddie Vmbers too and fro: In Vallies low, and on the Bray, And with thy feet the flowrs shall play. And I shall make thee pleasant Poses, Of Dasies Gilliflowrs and Roses: My Arms shalbe a Belt to thee: Thine if thou wilt, the like to mee. Of Floraes tapestrie thy Gowne, Thy Cap shall be my Lawrell Crowne: Which drest of Daphne's haire shall shine, Whyls on my head, and whyls on thine. And thou vpon thy rock shalt rest, And heare the Echoes from my brest: For I shall sing in Sonets shill, the charming numbers of my quill. Yea wee with woond'ring eyes shall gaze On many sundrie curious maze: And view the Architecture fare, Of rich and statelie buddings rare. And we shall looke about and see, The wrack of time before our ee: The pendul stones, their builders ban, Imploring help at hand of man. And wee shall see the Riuers rin, With delicat and daintie din: And how my Douern night and day. With sweet Meanders slides away. To pay her debts vnto the Sea, And like a wanton Nimph doth flie Through blooming banks with smiling face Her Lord the Ocean to imbrace. And wee shall see the towrs of tree, Halfe seeme to swim, and halfe to flie: Part in the Sea, part in the Aire, And Eag'l heere, a Dolphin thaire. Wee shall behold Nereid Nymphs, Make waters welcome from their lymps: And euery houre into the day, Fresh Floods and th' Ocean billowes play. And we shall heare the Roches ring, While storme-presageing: Mermayds sing: And on the Rocks the law's shall roare, Salut and resalut the Shoare. And when Apollo taks his rest, With wearie Horses in the West: And Cynthia begins to shine, Thy Poets Tugur shall be thine. Then shalt thou see my homlie fare, And what poore riches I haue thare: And if those things can moue thy mind, Come, come, and be no more vnkind. LESBIA her answer to ALEXIS. If all were thine that there I see, Thou paynts to breed content to mee: Then those delights might moue my mind To yeeld, and be no more vnkind. Sith nought is thine that thou sets downe, Saue Songs, thy selfe, thy Belt, thy Crowne, Thy Tugure, and thy homely fare: And that poore wealth which thou hast thare. I might be compted most accurst, To dwell with thee, suppose I durst: And men might thinke mee more then mad, To leaue the better for the bad. Yet least I should be deemd ingrate, To loath thee for thy poore estate, Though Fortune be thy fremmit foe, No reason were I should be so. Thy Lines allure mee to be thine, And thou shalt see it soone or sine: The christall streams shall backward moue, Ere I forget thy faythfull loue. A new perswasion to LESBIA. Once more I pray thee be my Loue, Come liue with mee, and thou shalt proue All pleasures that a Poets vaine, Can find on mould or in the mane. Wilt thou vpon my Parnas walke, And tread the Flowrs with leauie stalke, Which bud on my biforked tops: Bedew'd with sweet Cactalian drops. On Thithorea wilt thou go, Or Hyampens too and fro? Or wilt thou with Pierid Nimphs, Drinke of these euer-flowing Limphs, From Hyppocrene which diuall, Or springs of Aganippe wall? Wilt thou repose thee in the shade, Which Nature hath diuinely made? Apolloes Laurell thou shalt see, And louely Venus Myrtle tree, Alcides Popler full of state, The Palme which thriues in spight of hate. Mineruaes Oliue, and the Mirr, And of great Mars the warlike Firr: Which Nature hath so well desposed, And there withall such walks inclosed, As for rich Tapestrie shall serue, From beames thy beautie to preserue: The Gilliflowrs and Roses sweet, Shall stoope their tops beneath thy feet: The Vlolet and Primrose faire, The Marigold with yellow haire: Both Moli and the Balme shall smell, With Miriads more then I can tell: The louely Herald of the Spring, The Philomel to thee shall sing, Both Larke and Maues shall abone. Thy head their small recordars toone: I'll make thee Garlands faire of Flowrs, With Amadriads in their bowers, With Myrtill boughs braue to behold, And paint their leaues with spangs of gold, Which I will checker all with frets Of prettie pinks and Violets: And when Apolloes Coach agaue Giues way vnto Dianaes Wane: Thy Poet on his pyping Reed, Thy fansie with sweet Songs shall feed. Thou shalt want no content of mind, Saue wealth, which seldome Poets find: If pouertie hath power to moue, Come, come sweet heart, and be my Loue. A Letter to LESBIA, shewing his discontents. Oft haue I pray'd thee be my Loue, Come liue with mee, and thou shalt proue All pleasures that a Poets vaine Can find on mold, or in the mane: Yet neither can my Loue (allace) Nor my oblectaments haue place, To moue thy hard and flintie hart, Some pities portion to impart. Dispeasure maks my Muse be doomb, And Parnas barren is become: My Wels are dry, trite wayes my walks, My Flow'rs do fade vpon their stalks: Trees lack both leaues, and Larks to sing: Those Fruits thy falset doth foorth bring, Hadst thou not known that I was poore, Then Luker might thy loue allure: Why art thou of so churlish kind, To loue the moyan, not the mind? Proud in her heart would Phillis bee, To proue thy pediseque, for mee: Shee followeth mee, and yet I flie, Pursew'd of her, and plagu'd of thee: But wouldst thou to thy seruile slaue, Bequeath the credit which I craue? Mule, Birds, Hils, Wels, Trees, Flowrs, &amp; Walks, Would sing, flow, florish on their stalks: And I reuiu'd by thee (faire Dame) My wonted courage would acclame. Then let me know thy vtter will, Vpon this Paper good or ill: And so till I the same receaue, I am thy well affected slaue. Sonet to LESBIA. Time and my thoughts Togither spurr the Post, For once I thought to spend my time for gaine: Yet while I thought this thought, the time was lost And left me there, to thinke my thought was vaine And while I pause the posting time to spend, Time spends it selfe and mee: but how I muse: The more I muse, the more I hast my end. Thus Time doth mee, and I do Time abuse: That Time once tint can not returne againe. A secret sorrow doth posses my mind, But least the world should know why I complaine Deare to my soule I pray thee proue more kind. I dreame the darke, and driue in dooll the day, Thus wast my time, and weare my selfe away. LESBIA her answer. Driue not deare hart, in dooll the day, Wast not thy selfe nor Time away: Doo not so much as dreame by night, Vnles thy Dreames be short and slight. Though wauering wits in time will vaige, Be thou thy selfe a constant Craige. And for thy Loue thou bears to mee, I am thy debtor till I die. What I haue hight hap good or ill, But fraud or feare I shall fulfill, I am not of a churlish kind, To loue the moyane not the mind, No contrar chause, nor fortune strange, Shall make my setled mind to change: I am thine sworne, and I shall seale What I haue sayd; till when fareweale. CODRVS Complaint and Farewell to Ralatibia. A shepheard poore with store of pains opprest Beneath the branches of a leauie tree, With Lute in hand deliuered his vnrest, When none was nie but Satyrs, Fauns, and hee: And hauing tund his base and treble string, Hee sigh'd, hee sob'd, and thus began to sing. Why am I banisht from those blessed bounds Where I was wont with pleasure to repaire? What cruell doome my comfort so confounds, And casts mee in the confins of dispaire? What haue I done, sayd, thought (allace the while) that can procure proscription and exile? I am condem'd, and no inditment heard: There is no grace nor mercie in her eyes. I plead for peace, and presence is debard: I loue, she loath's; I follow, and she flies: All modest means that may be, I haue vs'd, My Songs, my selfe, my friends, are all refus'd. Why, was I borne to be the poynt of paine, The scorne of Time, the obloquie of Fame? My fellow Shepheards frollicke ouer the plaine, They feed their flocks, &amp; court the countrie Dame On Holidayes their Sonets sweet thy sing, And to their Loues their best oblations bring. But I exild from Kalatibia's eyes By her decret, whom I shall ay adore: Must sacrifice, sigh, tears, plaints, grons, and cryes: But all in vaine, and woe is mee therefore: I long, I loue, I fry, I freeze, I pine, No punishment can be compard to mine. Allace, allace, my flocks both starue and stray, quit macerat to want their maisters eye: Which with Liciscais harmles Barke would stay, And turne againe from neighbour corns to mee: My litle Lambs, my faire and fertill Ewes, With sad reports their plaints for mee renewes. What madnes mooues remorsles faire, thy mind, Since neither plaints nor prayers can haue place? Hast thou concluded still to kythe vnkind, And day by day delight in my disgrace? O bee it so! if needs it must be so, For I am armd for euerie kind of woe. Since I am thus proscrib'd, I pray thee take (Faire Kalatibia) this inforc'd fareweale. Since Fortune, Loue, and weerds, auow my wrake, To whom shall I (despised soule) appeale? O loue no more, nor leue no more a thrall, Die Codrus die, end loue and life and all. But Pusillanyme poore and hartles man, Why wouldst thou die to please so proud a Dame? Though thou be banisht for a while, what than, Shee's not so cruell but shee may reclame? Yet flie, be gone; let good or bad befall thee. And care no more, suppose she neuer recall thee And thus poore soule, from out the Groue he goes, And leaues (allace) both Lines and Lute behind: Which I (the true Secretar to his woes, And fellow of his fortuns) did foorth find: And for his sake I sigh, sing, say, &amp; show them that cruel she, wh? they concern may know th?. CODRVS his reconciliation to his heart, after he hath abiured KALATIBIA. Poore wandring hart, which like the prodig child From reasons rule hath run so long astray, Misled by Loue, with fancies fond beguild: And now returnd with torne and rent array, my halfe and better part since thou art come, with true remorse most kindly welcome home. Laciuious looks of life bewitching eye, Inconstant oath's of most vnsetled mind, You fals inflections of a Iudas knee, You worthles vowes which vanish with the wind, Dispatch your selfe, and let mee liue in peace, Within my hart thou haue no dwelling place. Come sit thee downe (deare hart) wee'l haue a feast My fond Conceits I for a Calfe will kill: I am thy Oast, and thou shalt be my guest, Repenting Teares will furnish Wine at will: Our Musick Sighs: and if I were more able, Fayth thou should find a banquet for thy table. With hartie draughts will wee to drinke begin, Vnto the brim let reasonn fill each bowll: I'll lock the gate, and Loue shall not looke in, That our contract may knit without controull, In surest sort let vs betroth our selfe, And band gainst Beautie, and the blinded elfe. Sigh sorie hart, and I will weepe with thee, Let no eclipse diuide vs two againet Let Reason hencefoorth guyd and ruler bee, And wast no more the swift wingd Time in vaine And while my teares can intertaine thy feast, Repenting heart thou art a pleasing Ghuest. Now setlet heart secure and free from feare, Though all the earth should sinke in seas of Loue, Fleet in the Arke, sit still in Reasons chare, And to the world giue verdits from aboue, The life of Wisedome in Experience lies: Then let thine owne misfortuns mak thee wise. Famineos posthac disce canere dolos. FINIS. To the Author. Loue now resolu'd to work so rare a wonder, As to make Rocks bereauers, Stones a Streame, Straight to a Craig of Caledon hee came: Whose yet vndaunted prid hee gan to ponder. Haue I (said hee) the Earth's deepe Center vnder, Made Phlegeton his floods to feare my flame? Did I the mightie Trident bearer tame, And threatned roo, the thrower of the thunder? And shall one onely Craig withstand my dart, With that his Arrow to his eare he drew, which through the yeelding air loud whistling flew And turnd his hardnes to a humane Hart: From out whose wound, witnes you Nymph's but names Great Floods gush out of sweet Castalian streames.
