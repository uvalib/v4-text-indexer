      <field name="fulltext">THE VOTE OR A POEME ROYALL, PRESENTED TO HIS MAIESTIE for a New-yeares-Gift. By way of Discourse 'twixt the Poet, and his Muse. Calendis Januariis 1642. POEMA ???????????. The world's bright Eye, Times measurer, begun Through watry Capricorne his course to run, Old Ianus hastned on, his temples bovnd With Ivy, his gray haires with hollie crownd; When in a serious quest, my thoughts did muse, What Gift, as best becomming, I should chuse, To Britaines Monarch (my dread Soveraigne) bring Which might supply a New-yeares offering. I rummag'd all my stores, and search'd my cells Where nought appear'd, god wot, but bagatells: No farre fetch'd Indian gemme, cut out of rock, Or fishd in shels were trusted under lock, No peece which Angelo's strong fancy hitt, Or Titians pensil, or rare Hyliards witt, No Ermines, or black-sables, no such Skinnes, As the grim Tartar hunts, or takes in ginnes: No Medails, or rich stuff of Tyrian dye, No costly Boules of frosted argentry, No curious Land-skip, or some Marble peece Dig'd up in Delphos, or else-where in Greece, No Roman Perfumes, Buffs, or Cordouans Made drunk with Ambar by Moreno's hands, No arras, or rich carpets freighted o're The surging Seas from Asia's doubtfull shore, No Lions cub, or beast of strange aspect, Which in Numidia's fiery womb had slept, No old Toledo blades, or Damaskins, No Pistols, or some rare-spring'd Carrabins, No Spanish Ginet, or choyce stallion sent, From Naples, or hot Afrique's continent, In fine, I nothing found, I could descry Worthy the hands of CÃ¦sar or his eye. My wits were at a stand, when, loe, my Muse (None of the Quire, but such as they do use For laundresses or handmaids of meane rank J knew sometimes on Po and Isis banks) Did softly buzz. Muse. Then let me something bring, My hansell the New-yeare to Charles my King, May usher in bifronted Ianusâ Poet. Thou fond foole-hardy Muse, thou silly Thing, Which 'mongst the shrubbs &amp; reeds do'st use to sing, Dar'st thou peck up, and the tall Cedar clime, And venture on a King with gingling rime? Though all thy words were perle, thy letters gold, And cut in rubies, or cast in a mould Of diamonds, yet still thy lines would be To meane a gift for such a Majestie. Muse. I'le try; and hope to passe without disdaine Jn New-yeares-gifts the mind stands for the maine, The Sophy, finding 'twas well meant, did daigne Few dropps of running water from a swayne, Then sure 'twill please my Liege, if J him bring, Some gentle dropps from the Castalian spring. Though Rarities J want of such account, Yet have J something on the forked mount. Nor i'st the first, or third accesse J made To CÃ¦sar's feet, and thence departed glad. For as the Sun with his male heat doth render Nile's muddy slime fruitfull, and apt t'engender, And dayly to produce newe kinds of creatures Of various shapes, and thousand differing features, So is my fancy quickned by the glance Of His benigne aspect and countenance, It makes me pregnant, and to superfÃ¦te, Such is the vigor of His beames and heate. Once in a Vocall Forest I did sing, And made the Oke to stand for Charles my King, The best of trees, whereof (it is no vant The greatest Schooles of Europe ring and chant) There you shall also find Dame Arhetine, Great Henries daughter, and Great Britaines, Queene, Her name engraven in a Laurell tree, And so transmitted to Eternity. For now I heare that Grove speake's besides mine, The language of the Loire, the Po, and Rhyne, (And to my Prince (my sweet Black Prince) of late, I did a youthfull subject dedicate.) Nor do I doubt but that in time, my Trees Will yeeld me fruit to pay Apollo's fees, To offer up whole Hecatombes of praise To CÃ¦sar, if on me he cast his rayes. And if my lamp have oyle, I may compile The moderne Annals of great Albion's Isle, To vindicat the truth of Charles his raigne, From scribling Pamphletors, who story staine With loose imperfect passages, and thrust Lame things upon the world, t'ane up in trust. I have had Audience (in another straine) Of Europes greatest Kings, when German maine And the Cantabrian waves I cross'd, I drank Of Tagus, Seine, and sate at Tybers bank, Through Scylla &amp; Charybdis I have steerd, Where restlesse Ãtna, belching flames, appeerd, By Greece, once Palla's garden, then J pass't, Now all ore spread with Jgnorance and wast. Nor hath faire Europe her vast bounds throughout An Academe of note J found not out. But now J hope in a successefull prore, The Fates have fix'd me on sweet Englands shore, And by these various wandrings true J found, Earth is the common Mother, every ground May be one's Countrey, for by birth each man Is in this VVorld a Cosmopolitan A free-borne Burgesse, and receives thereby His denization from Nativity: Nor is this World, at best, but a huge Inn. And men the rambling passengers, wherin Some warm lodgings find, &amp; that as soone As out of Nature's closets they see no one, And find the table ready layd; but some Must for their commons trudg, and shift for roome: VVith easie pace some clime Promotions Hill, Some in the Dale, do what they can, stick still. Some through false glasses smiling Fortune spy, VVho still keeps off, though she appeares hard by: Some like the Ostrich, with their wings do flutter, But cannot fly, or soare above the gutter, Some quickly fetch and double Good-Hopes Cape, Some ne're can do't though the same cours they shape: So that poore mortals are so many balls Tossd, some o're line, some under Fortune's walls. And it is Heavens high pleasure Man should lye Obnoxious to this partiality, That by Industrious ways he should contend, Nature's short pittance to improve and mend. And Industry ne're fail'd, at last, t'advance Her patient sonnes above the reach of Chance. Poet. But whither rov'st thou thus? Well; since I see thou art so strongly bent, And of a gracious looke so confident, Go, and throw down thy selfe at CÃ¦sars feet, And in thy best attire thy Soveraigne greet, Go, An auspicious and most blissefull year, Wish Him, as e're shin'd o're this Hemispheare, Good may the Entrance, better the middle be, And the Conclusion best of all the three, Of joy ungrudg'd may each day be a debter, And evry morne still usher in a better, May the soft gliding Nones and evry Ide, With all the Calends stil some good betide, May Cynthia with kind looks, &amp; PhÅbus's rayes, One cleere his Nights, the other guild his dayes. Free limbs, unphysick'd health, due appetite, Which no sauce else but Hunger may excite, Sound sleepes, and sanguine dreames, which represent, Symptomes of health, and the next dayes content; Cheerfull and vacant thoughts, not always bound To Counsell, or in deep Ideas drown'd: (Though such late traverses and tumults might Turne to a lump of care the ayriest wight) And since, while fragile flesh doth us array The humors still are combating for sway, (Which were they free of this reluctancy And counterpoys'd Man would immortall be) May sanguine ore the rest predominat Jn Him, and their malignant flux abate. May his great Queen (in whose Jmperious eye Raigne's such a world of winning Majesty) Like the rich Olive, or Falernian Vine, Swell with more gemms of Cions masculine; And as Her fruit sprung from the Rose and Luce, (The best of stemmes Earth yet did e're produce) Js tyed already by a Sanguine lace To all the Kings of Europe's highborne race, So may they shoot, their youthfull branches o're, The surging seas, and graffe with evry shore. May home-Comerce, and Trade encrease from farre, That both the Indies meet within his barres, And bring in Mounts of Coyne His mint's to feed, And Banquers (Trafique's chiefe supporters) breed, Which may enrich his Kingdomes, Court and Towne, And ballast still the Coffers of the the Crowne, For Kingdoms are as ships, the Prince his chests The ballast, which if empty, when distress't VVith stormes, their holds are lightly trimm'd, the keele Can run no steedy cours, but tosse and reele. May his Imperiall Chamber alwayes ply To his desires, her wealth to multiply, That she may prize his royall favour more Than al the wares fetch'd fr? the great Mogor, May the Great Senat with the subjects right Put in the Counter-scale, the Regall might The flowrs of th'Crown, that they may propp each other, And like the Grecian's twin live, love together. For the chief glory of a people is The power of their King, as Their is His. May He be still within himselfe at home, That no just passion make the reason rome, Yet Passions have their turnes, to rouse the Soule, And Stirre her slumbring Spirits not controule, For as the Ocean besides ebb and flood, (VVhich Nature's greatest Clerk ner'e understood) Is not for sayle, if an impregning wind Fills not the flagging canvas, so a mind Too calme, is not for Action, if desire Heat's not it selfe at passion's quickning fire, For Nature is allow'd sometimes to muster Her passions, so they only blow, not bluster. May iustice still in her true scales appeare, And Honor fix'd in no unworthy spheare, Unto whose palace all accesse should have Through vertues Temple, not through Plutos Cave. May his true subjects hearts be his chiefe Fort, Their purse his treasure, and their Love his Port Their prayers, as sweet Incense, to draw downe Myriads of blessings on his Queene and Crowne. And now that his glad presence, did asswage, That fearefull tempest in the North did rage, May those frogg-vapours in the Irish skie, Be scatter'd by the beames of Majesty, That the Hibernian lyre give such a sound, May on our coasts with joyfull Ecchos bound. And when this fatall planet leaves to lowre, VVhich to to long on Monarchies doth powre His direfull influence, may Peace once more Descend from Heaven on our tottering shore, And ride in triumph both on land and maine, And with her milke-white steedes draw Charles his waine, That so for those Saturnian times of old, An age of Pearle may come in lieu of Gold. Be all his thoughts borne perfect, and his hopes, In their events fall out beyond their scopes, Vertue still guide his course, and if there be A thing as Fortune Him accompanie. May no ill Genius haunt him, but by's side, The best protecting Angell ever bide. May He go on to vindicate the right Of holy things, and make the Temple bright, To keep that Faith, that Sacred Truth entire Which He receiv'd from Salomon his sire. And since we all must hence, by th'Iron Decree, Stamp'd 'mongst the black Records of Destinie, Late may his life, his Glory ne're we are out, Till the great yeare of Plato wheele about. So prayeth The worst of Poets, to The best of Princes, yet The most loyall of His Votaries and Vassalls. Iames Howell Ah, Ha; Tumulus, Thalamus: Two Counter-POEMS, The First, an ELEGY Upon Edward late Earl of Dorset; The Second, an EPITHALAMIVM to the Lord M. of Dorchester. Invicem cedunt Dolor &amp; Voluptas, Funera, TÃ¦dÃ¦, Sorrow may endure for a Night, But joy cometh in the Morning. AN ELEGY UPON THE MOST ACCOMPLISH'D, AND HEROIC LORD EDWARD EARL OF DORSET, Lord Chamberlain to His late Majesty of Great Britain, and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c. Alluding to The Quality of the Times, Alluding to His admired Perfections, Alluding to His goodly Person, Alluding to His Antient Pedigree, Alluding to His Goat of Armes crested with a Star; Alluding to The Condition of Mortality, Alluding to The Passion of the Author closing with an Epitaph. Lords have bin long Declining, (we well know) And making their last Testaments, but now They are Defunct, they are Extinguish'd All, And never like to rise by this Lords Fall; A Lord, whose Intellectualls alone Might make a House of Peers, and prop a Throne, Had not so dire a Fate hung o're the Crown, That Privilege Prerogative should drown; Where e're he sate he sway'd, &amp; Courts did awe, Gave Bishops Gospell, and the Judges law With such exalted Reasons, which did flow So cleer and strong, that made AstrÃ¦a bow To his Opinion, for where He did side Advantag'd more than half the Bench beside. But is great Sakvile dead? Do we Him lack, And will not all the Elements wear black? Whereof he was compos'd a perfect man As ever Nature in one frame did span. Such Highborn Thoughts, a Soul so large and free, So clear a Judgment, and vast Memory, So Princely Hospitable and Brave Mind We must not think in hast on earth to find, Unless the Times would turn to Gold agen, And Nature get new strength in forming men. His Person with it such a state did bring That made a Court as if He had bin King, No wonder, since He was so neer a Kin To Norfolks Duke, and the great Mayden Queen. He courage had enough by conquering One To have confounded that whole Nation, Those parts which single do in some appear Were all concentred here in one bright Sphear, For Brain, Toung, Spirit, Heart, and Personage To mould up such a Lord will ask an age, But how durst pale white-liver'd Death seaze on So dauntles and Heroic a Champion? Yes, to Dye once is that uncancell'd debt Which Nature claymes, and rayseth by Eschet On all Mankind by an old Statute past Primo Adami, which will alwaies last Without Repeal, nor can a second lease Be had of Life when the first term doth cease. Mount noble Soul, Among the starrs take place, And make a new One of so bright a Race May Jove out-shine, that Venus still may be In a benign Conjunction with Thee, To check that Planet which on Lords hath lowr'd, And such malign influxes lately powr'd; Be now a star thy self for those which here Did on thy Crest, and upper Robes appear, For thy Director take that Star we read Which to thy Saviours Birth three Kings did lead. A Corollary. Thus have I blubber'd out some tears and Verse On this Renowned Heroe, and His Herse, And could my Eyes have drop'd down Perls upon't In lieu of Teares, God knowes, I would have don't, But Teares are real, Perls for their Emblems go, The first are fitter to express my Wo; Let this small mite suffize untill I may A larger tribut to his ashes pay, In the mean time this Epitaph shall shut, And to my Elegy a period put. Here lie's a Grandee by Birth, Parts, and Mind, Who hardly left his Parallell behind, Here lie's the Man of Men, who should have been An Emperour, had Fate or Fortune seen. Totus in lachrymas solutus sic singultivit I. H. UPON THE NUPTIALLS OF THAT PRINCELY PAIR HENRY Lord M of DORCHESTER, AND The Lady KATHERINE STANLEY, Daughter to the late Heroic Earl of DERBY, An Epithalamium by way of Dialog 'twixt Philemon and Sylvius. Alluding to their 1. Complexions, He Sanguin, She Black and Fair. Alluding to their 2. Coats of Arms, Both Field-Argent, His a Lion Rampant in an orb of Cinqfoyls. Alluding to their 3. Countries. Alluding to their 4. Pedigrees. Going on with an HymenÃ¦um, or Vote, comprized in four Musicall Stanzas, the three first Ayrie and Poeticall, the last Serious. The Dialogue. Philemon. VVhat Object's that which I behold Dazzling my eyes with gemms and Gold? Her Face, me thinks, darts such a ray That adds more brightnes to the Day, Her breath perfumes the place, Her curls and hair Like Indian spice aromatize the Air, A sparkling white and black breaks from her sight Like to the Diamonds redoubling light, As she doth walk the very ground and stone Turn to Field-Argent which she treads upon; A Mortal sure she cannot be But some transcending Deitie; My dearest Sylvius pray unfold Who's that rare Creature I behold? Sylvius. She is a Princess and a Bride Goes to the Temple to be ti'd In Nuptiall bonds, her starrs will not permit That at the Vestall fires She longer sit; She's Derbie's Royall bloud, Derbyle Gran, And now She travells to the Ile of Man, She of the Princely Orenge is a branch Imp'd on the high Trimovillan stem of France, Two of the fairest Kingdomes strove, and try'd Their Utmost to compleat this Lovely Bride. 'Tis she which makes 'twixt gemms and gold That Constellation you behold. Philemon. But who's that comely sanguine Peer Which on her heart-side walks so neer? He likewise makes all Argent as he goes, Look at his feet how thick the Cinqfoyl grows. Sylvius. Tis Wise and Wealthy Pierrpont, who renowns With Titles, Three of Englands chiefest Towns, A precious pond'rous Lord, whose sole Estate A Jury of new Barons might create, Patron of Virtue, Chivalry, and Arts Cause he himself excells in all these Parts; 'Tis He who by the hand doth hold That Demi-Goddess you behold. Philemon. Is't so? then my Autumnall Muse shall sing An HymenÃ¦um, and fetch back Her spring, This Subject a fresh vigor doth inspire, And heats my brain with an unusuall fire. AN HYMENÃUM, OR BRIDAL-SONET, Consisting of four Stanzas, and to be sung by three voices, according to a choice Air set thereunto by Mr. WILLIAM WEBB. 1. Chorus May all Felicity betide This Princely Bridegroom, and his Bride. [1] May those delights this morn shall bring Be endless as their Nuptiall Ring, May they be constant, and exceed Each Others Wishes, Hopes, and Creed, May the three Regions of the air Powr showrs of blessings on this pair, May Sol and Cynthia with their rayes, Silver their nights and gild their dayes. 2. Chorus All joyes attend and best of Fate This noble Marques and His Mate. 2 Yee gentle Nymphs of Trent and Dee Make hast to this solemnity, Your streames and beds now meet in one By this High-sprung conjunction, Ye Wood-nymphs who green garlands wear In Shirewood launds, and Delamer, Yee Dames of Helicon attend, And Graces your sweet presence lend, Lucina com, and pray ther be Employment in due time for thee. Chorus. May all Felicity betide This noble Bridegroom, and his Bride. 3 May they such gallant Males produce Both to the Rose and Flowerdeluce, That Englands Chivalry and French May multiply, and bourgeon hence, Whose branches shooting o're the Main May knit, and blossome here again, That Pierrponts Lion and Cinqfoyl May ramp and root in every soyl; Nor may this noble Race wear out Till Plato's Great year wheel about. Chorus. May all Felicity betide This noble Bridegroom, and his Bride. 4. Stanza Closing with a serious graduall Vote. May all the Elements conspire To make them bless'd in their desire, May all the Stars on them reflect Their mildest looks in Trine aspect, May all the Angels them defend From every thing doth ill portend, May Angells, Stars, and Elements Affoord Them such compleat contents That They have nothing els to wish But a Perseverance of Bliss. Chorus. All joyes attend and best of Fate This noble Marquess and his Mate. FINIS.</field>
