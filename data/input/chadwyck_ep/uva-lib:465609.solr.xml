      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. PROLOGUE TO THE TALES. By Mr. OGLE. When April, soft'ning, sheds refreshing Show'rs, And frees, from droughty March, the springing Flow'rs; April! That bathes the teeming Womb of Earth, And gives, to Vegetation, kindly Birth! When Zephyr breathes the Gale that favors Love, And cherishes the Growth of ev'ry Grove; Zephyr! That ministers, with genial Breeze, Bloom to the Shrubs, and Verdure to the Trees! When youthful Phœbus half his Course compleats, Divides the Ram, and glows with temp'rate Heats; Phœbus! Our equal Good, the live-long Year, Or shou'd he take, or shou'd he quit the Sphere! When Philomel injoys the coming Spring, And feeling her Approach, delights to sing; Sweet Philomel! Of all the Birds that fly, The Sole, to pass the Night, with sleepless Eye! Then Pilgrims long to roam to foreign Lands; Then Palmers pass, with Branches in their Hands; Then various Vot'ries visit various Climes; Then sund'ry Saints are feed for sundry Crimes. But not Abroad, our English Zealots strole, To Canterbury tend the pious Shoal. There pay, and promise to the Saint Inshrin'd, For ev'ry Ail of Body, and of Mind. It so befell, that Season, on a Day, In Southwark, at the Tabarde-Inn, I lay; Ready, by Morn, my Progress to pursue: A Pilgrimage to See, was all my View! When at our Inn, before the Fall of Night, Lo! Twenty-Nine in Fellowship alight: Strangers, that chanc'd, in Company to fall, Unlike the Men, but Pilgrims they were all. To Canterbury Each propos'd to ride— The House was roomy, and the Stables wide: Well serv'd was ev'ry Beast, and ev'ry Guest, And Man and Horse were treated with the Best. I talk'd with Each, with Each familiar grew, Was One with All, before the Sun withdrew. And One and All agreed, at Dawn of Day, To Canterbury Town to take their Way. But here it falls in Season and in Place, That Company with Play keep Pace with Pace. Then e'er we sally, take, as I describe, The Characters of all our Pilgrim-Tribe; Just what they were, or what they seem'd to me, Their Age or Sex, their Fashion, or Degree, In what, Array, or what Condition in; This granted; with the Knight I first begin. The End of the Prologue. CHARACTERS OF THE PILGRIMS. By Mr. BETTERTON. The KNIGHT. A Knight there was, whose early Youth had shown His Love to Arms, and Passion for Renown. Courteous and affable, of Honor nice, A Friend to Truth, a Foe to ev'ry Vice. In many brave Engagements had he been, Known foreign Courts, and Men and Manners seen. In Christendom much Fame he had acquir'd; In Turkey he was dreaded and admir'd. When Alexandria was besieg'd and won, He pass'd the Trenches first, and scal'd the Town Granada's Siege increas'd the Warrior's Fame, And Algier trembled but to hear his Name; In fifteen Battles deathless Wreaths he got, Three single Combats with Success he fought. Much Ground he Travell'd o'er, for he had Seen Our Saviour's Sepulchre in Palestine. The barb'rous Infidels had felt his Might, Fierce in Engagement, gentle after Fight. In Council and in Conduct, Wise and Stay'd; In Conversation, modest as a Maid; Plain and Sincere, observant of the Right. In Mien and Manners, an accomplish'd Knight. A goodly Horse he rode, well Shap'd and Strong, No gaudy Saddle, nor no Trappings long. The Arms he wore, were bright, and free from Stain, His Habit serviceable, neat and plain: With grateful Zeal, devoutly he was come To thank the Saint, that brought him safely home. THE SQUIRE. With him his Son, a sprightly Squire, and gay; Youthful and Blooming as the Month of May; A fearless Lover, in a courtly Dress, With curling Locks, just taken from the Press. Of twenty Years he seem'd, well Shap'd and Tall, Strong was his Make, his Port majestical. The Army did his early Courage see In Flanders, and in fertile Picardy. He hop'd his Valour would all Forms remove, And plead successfully its Master's Love. His Vest with various Colours did abound, Like flow'ry Meads, when Spring adorns the Ground. Short was his Coat, the Sleeves were long and wide, Well could he Sing, and Treats and Balls provide. His fiery Steed he gracefully wou'd sit; Love-Songs he made, not wholly void of Wit. Some Skill in Painting too the Youth had shown, Could draw a Mistress, or design a Town; Love o'er his gentle Heart did so prevail, He slept as little as the Nightingale. THE SQUIRE's YEOMAN. This Squire a Yeoman had, and only him, Whose Truth and Diligence deserv'd Esteem; Girt with a Belt, his Garment was of Green, A Quiver stor'd with Arrows, bright and keen, Hung cross his Shoulders in a silken String, The Feathers borrow'd from the Peacock's Wing. At his left Side a weighty Sword he wore, And on his Arm, a well try'd Buckler bore: A Dagger; short and broad, was ty'd below, His strong right Hand sustain'd a mighty Bow, A Christopher his Bosom did adorn, In a fair Baldricke hung his Silver Horn. His Sun-burnt Visage, and his Grass-green Hood, Might prove him well a Ranger of the Wood. THE PRIORESS. There was with these a Nun, a Prioress, A Lady of no ord'nary Address. Her Smiles were harmless, and her Look was coy, She never Swore an Oath, but by St. Loye; Known by the Name of Lady Eglantine, She sung the Office with a Grace Divine. She spoke the French of Stratford-School, by Bow, The French of Paris She did never know. The French of Paris did to her appear Strange, as our Law-French to a Frenchman's Ear. At Meals she sat demure, carv'd neat, and well, No Morsel from her Lips unseemly fell. She never dipp'd her Finger in the Mess, Nor with one Drop defil'd her holy Dress: With a becoming Grace, and smiling Eye, She gain'd Respect from all the Company; Easy and free, still pleasant at her Meat, And held it no small pain to Counterfeit. She hated Stateliness, yet wisely knew What fit Regard was to her Title due. She pity'd ev'ry Creature in Distress, Devout, and charitable to Excess; Her tender Heart, with such Compassion fill'd, She'd weep to see a poor Mouse caught and kill'd. Her Lap-dogs still with her fair Hand she fed, With Milk, and Roast-meat, mixt with Crumbs of read; In her own Chamber, on her Bed they slept, If any dy'd, most bitterly she wept. Well set her Wimple, nicely pinch'd it was; Her Nose was straight, her Eyes were grey as Glass. Small was her Mouth, her Lips were red and soft; A beauteous Forehead, always borne aloft; Broad, smooth and shining Eye-brows, neat and small, A slender Waist, inclining to be tall. A curious Garment, wond'rous neat, she wore, A Pair of Beads, with Green enamel'd o'er, Of shining Coral, did her Arm infold, Grac'd with an Ornament of beaten Gold. Upon it was engrav'd; a circling Wreath, And Amor vincit omnia writ beneath. A Nun, who seldom from her Sight did stir, Her Chaplain, and three Priests attended her. THE MONK. Next these a merry Monk appears in Place, Who follow'd Hunting more than saying Mass. As bravely Mounted, as a Lord from Court, No well-fed Abbot bore a comelier Port. And when in State he ambled, all might hear The Jingling of his Bridle, loud and clear; As far, almost, as any Chapel Bell. This lordly Monk, once Keeper of a Cell, Held good St. Bennet's Order too severe; St. Maure to his nice Judgment did appear Too strict and rigid, for old Dotards fit, But scorn'd by Priests of Spirit and of Wit. One Scripture-Text he blotted with his Pen, That says, all Hunters are ungodly-Men. What Shoals of Converts would this Doctrine raise! Shall Monks in Study pass laborious Days? Turn o'er dull Fathers, and worm-eaten Books, With dazled Eyes, and melancholy Looks; Toil with their Hands to make the Garden neat, Turn Cooks, and baste the Roast with their own Sweat? This Austin humbly did; Did he? (Saith he) Austin may do the same again for me. He lov'd the Chace, the Hound's melodious Cry, Hounds that ran swiftly as the Swallows fly. His Sleeves, I saw, with Furs all lin'd within, From Russia brought, the finest Squirrels Skin; (Hair Shirts, he said, provok'd the Blood to Sin.) His Hood beneath, his double Chin to hold, 'Twas fasten'd with a curious Clasp of Gold. A Love-knot at the greater End there was; His Head close shav'd, and smooth as any Glass, His strutting Paunch was seldom disappointed, His broad full Face shone as it were anointed. His Eyes were sleepy, rolling in his Head, That steam'd like Furnaces of Molten Lead. Supple his Boots, his Horse he proudly sate; You'd take him for a Bishop by his State: Fasts had not made him meagre like a Ghost, But fat he was, and goodly as mine Host. A fat plump Swan he lov'd, young, but full grown, His Horse was sleek, and as the Berry brown. THE FRYAR. A Fryar next, to ev'ry Female dear, All the four Orders never had his Peer. Wanton, diverting still in Prose or Rhime, He many Couples married in his Time; Some young Ones at his own Expence he wed, And to their Husbands Grief, soon brought to Bed. A frank Companion, Secret, often try'd To gentle Dames, a Confessor and Guide; Licentiate of his Order once, and then, For one the Curate had, he shrifted ten; He with a Smile wou'd their Confession hear, No Soul had Cause his Penances to fear. His Absolutions pleasant, soft and mild; He stroak'd 'em as a Parent does his Child. To a poor Order, lib'ral Ladies fly, With golden Presents easy Penance buy. For Man is obstinate, and hard of Heart, He keeps his Money, tho' he feels the Smart. But to poor Fryars you must Silver give, 'Tis not with Pray'rs and Fasting they can live; He stitch'd within his Tippet, pretty Knives, With silver Pins, small Presents for kind Wives. In chearful Company, he sung all Day, To help his Voice, could on the Cittern play; His Arms were brawny, few such Weights could fling, Strong as a Champion for an English King. All Inns and Taverns in the Town he knew, But from the Poor, he prudently withdrew; To rich and lib'ral Penitents inclin'd, To those was meek, and of an humble Mind; None in Appearance more devout could be, The ablest Beggar of his House was he; He farm'd that Income, and procur'd a Grant, No holy Brother should disturb his Haunt. Coarse was his Habit, when a begging Fryar, In wanton Love-days, Gorgeous his Attire. Of finest Cloth was then his Demi-Cope, No Mendicant, but Stately as a Pope; Something he humm'd betwixt a Lisp and Song, To make his English Sweet upon his Tongue; His little Pigs-Eyes gave unequal Light, Like small Stars twinkling in a frosty Night. The good Wives chuckled, wheresoe'er he came, A useful Fry'r, and Hubert was his Name. THE MERCHANT. With these a Merchant in a motley Coat, Well mounted too, and bearded like a Goat; A Flander's Beaver on his Head he wore; His Boots were neatly Buckled on before: He prov'd with Reasons strong, and formal Face, T'increase in Wealth was to increase in Grace; Greedy of Gold, and popular Esteem, He wish'd the Sea were shut to all but him. Traffick in Money, he had study'd well, Knew where th' Exchange would rise, and where it fell; In Debt to none, in Bargains strict and nice; Thought unprompt Payment was the greatest Vice. What he with Pains had got, with Care he'd save, Not Charitable, for he seldom gave. THE Clerk or Scholar of Oxford. By Mr. OGLE. A Clerk of Oxford next appear'd in Sight, Who spent on Logic many a Day and Night. Lank as a Rake, the Steed on which He sat; And, sooth to say, the Man was nothing fat. Of Aspect sober, as of Body lean; Effect of Contemplation more than Spleen. Hollow his Vest, and thread-bare was his Coat, A Youth of Worth, He look'd, tho' not of Note. For He, nor Benefice had got, nor Cure, No Patron, yet so worldly, to insure! So dextrous yet, of Body, or of Face, To circumvent no Chaplain, with his Grace: Nor fulsome Dedication cou'd he write! Drudge for a Dame, or pander for a Knight! Much rather had he range, beside his Bed, A Score of Authors unadorn'd in Red, With Aristotle, Champion of the Schools; To mend his Ways, by Philosophic Rules: Than basely to a Vic'rage owe his Rise, By Courting Folly, or by Flatt'ring Vice; Than flourish like a Prebend in his Stall: That Way, he held, was not to rise, but fall. Nor wou'd he be the Man, for all his Rent; Nam'd you the Priest of Bray, or Priest of Trent! One Search of Science, he forgot alone; An useful Search! the Philosophic Stone! Hence, tho' his Head much learned Wealth might hold; Yet held he, in his Coffer, little Gold. And late, that Stock, a Foreign Journey drain'd, Curious to see, what yet of Rome remain'd. Not, to the Dead, that he confin'd his Looks, The Living he could read, and Men with Books; Yet most on Books, what he acquires, he spends, From Care of Parents, or from Love of Friends! And these, unbound, or bound, his Chambers strow, A choice Collection, bought for Use, not Show! There oft, in Secret, pray'd the grateful Youth, For those, that put him in the Way of Truth; That gave the Means, just Precepts to instill; Or taught him to distinguish Good from Ill. Thus grounded well, he study'd to proceed; And not a Word spoke more than there was need. 'Twas short or close, sententious or sublime, And urg'd with Modesty, and said in Time. For to instruct, he rather wish'd, than strove, Willing to be improv'd, or to improve! Still turn'd to moral Virtue was his Speech, And gladly wou'd he learn, and gladly teach. THE MAN of LAW, &amp;c. By Mr. BETTERTON. A Serjeant of the Law, discreet, precise, Well cou'd he plead at Bar, and well advise; Wealthy he was, but frugal of Expence, And his sage Look demanded Reverence. Weighty his Arguments; his Words were wise; Oft he had sat as Judge at an Assize: There by Commission rais'd to high Degree, Maturely weigh'd out Justice equally. Robes for the Bench he had, and for the Bar; No Serjeant was a greater Purchaser, If safe the Title, moderate the Price, A good Fee-simple never came amiss. He for a very busie Man did pass, And yet he seem'd much busier than he was. Whole Shoals of Clients in the Term he had; And Law enough to make those Clients mad. All his Conveyances were legal, true, No Flaw was found in any thing he drew. The Statutes of the Land he had by Heart, Turn'd all to Gold without the Chymist's Art: In a plain motley Coat he rode, ty'd fast With a strip'd Silken Sash about his Waist. THE Franklin, or Country-Gentleman. A Franklin was the Serjeant's chief Delight, His Beard was long, and as the Daisie white: Sanguine he was, and study'd Pleasure most, His Morning's Draught, Sack with a Nut-brown Toast. All Delicates, that Mony cou'd procure He had; a nice luxurious Epicure. With Fish and Fowl, with bak'd Meat and with roast, His Table groan'd, he valu'd not the Cost. All Rarities the Nation cou'd afford, Were search'd, and bought to fill his ample Board. In ev'ry Season, Delicates appear, Diversify'd each Quarter of the Year. Hare, Partridge, Pheasant ever were at Hand, Carp, Tench, and Bream, as ready at Command. With poignant Sauces proper for each Dish; Woe to the Cook, were any thing amiss. Spacious his Hall, and open was the Door, Fragments and Marrow-bones bespread the Floor; And, ready cover'd with all sorts of Food, All the long Day a Table dormant stood. This worthy Franklin bore a Purse of Silk, Fixt to his Girdle, white as Morning-milk. Knight of the Shire; first Justice at th' Assize, To help the Poor, the Doubtful to advise. In all Employments, gen'rous, just he prov'd, Renown'd for Courtesy, by all belov'd. THE Haberdasher; Weaver; Carpenter; Dyer; Tap'stry-Merchant. By Mr. OGLE. An Haberdasher next, a portly Wight! Sleek was his Beaver, as a Sherif's white; A Weaver follow'd, dext'rous to command The sliding Shuttle, thrown from Hand to Hand; A Carpenter, that well cou'd play his Part Thro' all the Weapons of the Plaining Art; A Dyer, that ev'ry Color knew to stain, Or change anew, tho' ne'er so deep in Grain; A Tap'stry-Merchant last, whose Web might pass, Less for the Work of London, than Aras: All of a Livery, each for other made, All solemn Brothers, diff'ring but in Trade; One Stamp of Mind their very Forms express'd, Same shap'd, like fac'd, like manner'd, and same drest. Fresh were their Cloaths, nor bought at trivial Cost, So fresh, no Part its Christmass Gloss had lost. Worne only on the Hours to feast or pray, And dormant ev'ry common-letter'd Day. No vulgar Daggers, vamp'd with Brass, They wore, But trim'd with Silver of the finest Ore. With Silver stitcht, the Pouches by their Side, The Belts, that gird their Loins, with Silver ty'd. A fair and ample Burgess, One and All, And fit to fill the Tables of Guild-Hall; Or when they meet to traffic, or to feast: For Each was siz'd an Alderman at Least. Staunch stood their City-shops in good Repair, And neat their Boxes built for Country Air; Where still, to breathe, on Saturdays They went; For large their Stock in Trade, as well as Rent. Of which their Wives were not a little proud, And push'd the Foremost in the Sunday Croud. Nor wou'd we here their Worldly Wisdom blame, Respect from All superior Riches claim; And tho' an aukward, 'tis a pleasant Sight, To see the Bustling Dame assert her Right; Full of the Money, torne from the Distrest, Conceit herself a Thing above the Rest. Madam! My Lady! seems a glorious Sound! When loftily She moves, to Vigils bound; With Mantle borne before, and Train behind: For Wealth gives Pow'r of Face, and Pride of Mind. THE COOK. By the same Hand. With Them, a trav'ling Cook They jointly led, (For thriving Cits are delicately fed) Well skill'd in all the Culinary Toil, The Chick, just cackling in the Shell, to boil; The Cypress Root, to shread and press with Art; To lay the Custard, and to raise the Tart; To pouder Marchant, ev'ry Game to roast; To melt the Marrow, and to brown the Toast; To season and to lard; to grill and fry; To pound the Mortrey, and to bake the Pie. Great Harm it was, (for much it flack'd his Pace,) A Mormal on his Shin had taken Place; And sorely griev'd, the Blemish I descry'd; But what his Legs refus'd, his Hands supply'd. Of Palate, exquisite! Of Labor, free! A Kitchen Doctor in the first Degree, The Food to cater, or the Dish to fill; Blanc-mange was held his Master-piece of Skill. THE Shipman or Seaman, &amp;c. By Mr. BETTERTON. Then came a Dartmouth Seaman far from West, A very aukward Rider at the Best. A coarse Cloth Gown he wore, not long nor wide, His Dagger in a Lace adorn'd his Side. He knew those sultry Climates, where the Sun Turn'd his Complexion to a dusky Brown. To Company and Mirth he did incline, Had swallow'd many a Draught of Bourdeaux Wine. Kept an obedient Seaman's Conscience, Held borrowing from his Owners no Offence. If 'twas his Fate, to take a lucky Prize, (For stoutly he wou'd fight) he was so Wise To pick the best, which sent by Parcels home, Little of Worth did to the Office come. A perfect Master of the Compass, he Cou'd shun each Rock and Shallow in the Sea. Had weather'd Tempests, in Engagements been, 'Scap'd many Dangers, many Countries seen. Knew ev'ry Creek and Harbour on the Main, Of England, Scotland, and the Coast of Spain. In many Fights his Frigate much was fam'd, The Magdalene of England it was nam'd. THE DOCTOR of PHYSICK. The Doctor next; a Foe to all Excess, Who travell'd more for Health than Holiness. In nice Anatomy well skill'd was he, And not a Stranger to Astronomy. He knew to wire-draw a Distemper well, And cures by Magic natural foretel. A deep Astrologer, and could with Ease Cast the Nativity of each Disease; Show at what punctual Hour it shou'd expire, In Terms which Knaves invent, and Fools admire. The Cause of ev'ry Malady he knew, Whether of Cold, Heat, Moist, or Dry it grew. Told which of those engender'd the Disease, 'Twas but removing that, and you'd have Ease: Th' Apothecary waited his Command, Drugs and Electuaries were still at Hand. Whatever one prescrib'd, the other made, And each by Turns advanc'd the mutual Trade. He'd tell the Wonders, wrought by Phœbus' Son, What Fame the great Hippocrates had won: Well read in Galen, Celsus, Avicene, In Dioscorides and Damascene. These Names, and many more, he had by rote, Which to th' unlearn'd he never fail'd to quote. No Bible on his Pagan Shelves had he, It was prohibited the Layety. In Diet singular, young tender Meat, And easy of Digestion, he wou'd eat. At a rich Patient's Table, bold and free; But at his own, he prais'd Frugality; Of Scarlet Persian Silk his Habit was, And neatly lin'd with Taffety, or Gause. Great were his Gains, but mod'rate his Expence; He flourish'd in a Time of Pestilence. Gold's the best Cordial; yet he lov'd to see Coin'd Aurum, rather than potabile. THE WIFE of BATH. A merry Wife of Bath comes next in Place, But somewhat deaf, with an autumnal Face; By Trade a Weaver, one who scorn'd to grant Her Work out-done at Ypres, or at Gaunt. No Matron could with greater Zeal incline To pay her Off'ring at the Martyr's Shrine. She neither patient, nor devout could be, If any rival'd her in Charity. In her own Parish She would take the Wall, Before the proudest Matron of 'em all. Upon a Sunday ever trimly drest, She flaunted forth, the Envy of the Rest; Large were her Kerchiffs, yet more gorgeous made With her own Work, and full three Pound they weigh'd. Scarlet her Hose, her glossy Shoes were new; Bold was her Face, and ruddy was its Hue; Not one of her five Husbands could be found, She lay'd 'em safe long since in holy Ground. With these she made a Shift to pass her Youth; Such was this good Wife's Constancy and Truth! She travell'd far, pass'd many a rapid Stream; Thrice saw the Reliques of Jerusalem. Rome and the Catacombs she knew full well; Strange Things of Cologne and its Kings could tell: Spain she had travell'd o'er from End to End, And good St. James was very much her Friend. Of various Haps and Perils by the Way; Much had she known, and yet much more wou'd say. Upon an ambling Pad at Ease she sat, Jingling the Bit, and slack'd her Pace to chat. A Steeple Hat she wore upon her Head, Whose ample Brims were like a Buckler spread; O'er her large Hips, a Mantle fairly wrought Before; her Kerchiff to a Point was brought; Like a rank Rider, pointed Spurs she wore; Of Jests she had an unexhausted Store; Her Talk did notably Love's Art advance; For she had practis'd long that old, new Dance. THE PARSON. By Mr. DRYDEN. A Parish Priest was of the Pilgrim-Train; An Awful, Rev'rend, and Religious Man, His Eyes diffus'd a venerable Grace, And Charity itself was in his Face. Rich was his Soul, tho' his Attire was poor; (As God had cloth'd his own Ambassador;) For Such, on Earth, his bless'd Redeemer bore. Of Sixty Years he seem'd; and well might last To Sixty more, but that he liv'd too fast; Refin'd himself to Soul, to curb the Sense; And made almost a Sin of Abstinence. Yet had his Aspect nothing of severe, But such a Face as promis'd him sincere. Nothing reserv'd or sullen was to see: But sweet Regards; and pleasing Sanctity: Mild was his Accent, and his Action free. With Eloquence innate his Tongue was arm'd; Tho' harsh the Precept, yet the Preacher charm'd. For, letting down the golden Chain from high, He drew his Audience upward to the Sky: And oft, with holy Hymns, he charm'd their Ears: (A Musick more melodious than the Spheres.) For David left him, when he went to Rest, His Lyre; and after him, he sung the best. He bore his great Commission in his Look: But sweetly temper'd Awe; and soften'd all he spoke. He preach'd the Joys of Heav'n, and Pains of Hell; And warn'd the Sinner with becoming Zeal; But on eternal Mercy lov'd to dwell. He taught the Gospel, rather than the Law: And forc'd himself to drive; but lov'd to draw. For Fear but freezes Minds; but Love, like Heat, Exhales the Soul sublime, to seek her Native Seat. To Threats, the stubborn Sinner oft is hard: Wrapp'd in his Crimes, against the Storm prepar'd; But, when the milder Beams of Mercy play, He melts, and throws his cumb'rous Cloak away. Lightning and Thunder (Heav'n's Artillery) As Harbingers before th' Almighty fly: Those but proclaim his Stile, and disappear; The stiller Sound succeeds; and God is there. The Tithes, his Parish freely paid, he took; But never Su'd; or Curs'd with Bell and Book. With Patience bearing Wrong; but off'ring none: Since ev'ry Man is free to lose his own. The Country Churls, according to their Kind, (Who grudge their Dues, and love to be behind) The less he sought his Off'rings, pinch'd the more; And prais'd a Priest, contented to be Poor. Yet, of his little, he had some to spare, To feed the Famish'd, and to cloath the Bare: For mortify'd he was, to that Degree, A poorer than himself he wou'd not see. True Priests, he said, and Preachers of the Word, Were only Stewards of their Sov'reign Lord; Nothing was theirs, but all the publick Store; Intrusted Riches, to relieve the Poor: Who, shou'd they steal, for want of his Relief, He judg'd himself Accomplice with the Thief. Wide was his Parish, not contracted close In Streets, but here and there a straggling House; Yet still he was at hand, without Request, To serve the Sick, or succour the Distress'd: Tempting, on Foot alone, without Affright, The Dangers of a dark tempestuous Night. All this the good old Man perform'd alone, Nor spar'd his Pains; for Curate he had none. Nor durst he trust another with his Care; Nor rode himself to Paul's, the publick Fair, To chaffer for Preferment with his Gold, Where Bishopricks and Sine Cures are sold: But duly watch'd his Flock, by Night and Day, And from the prowling Wolf redeem'd the Prey; And hungry sent the wily Fox away. The Proud he tam'd, the Penitent he chear'd; Nor to rebuke the rich Offender fear'd. His Preaching much, but more his Practice wrought (A living Sermon of the Truths he taught;) For this, by Rules severe, his Life he squar'd; That all might see the Doctrine which they heard; For Priests, he said, are Patterns for the rest; (The Gold of Heav'n, who bear the God impress'd) But when the precious Coin is kept unclean, The Sov'reign's Image is no longer seen. If they be foul, on whom the People trust, Well may the baser Brass contract a Rust. The Prelate, for his holy Life, he priz'd; The worldly Pomp of Prelacy despis'd. His Saviour came not with a gaudy Show, Nor was his Kingdom of the World below. Patience in Want, and Poverty of Mind, These Marks of Church and Churchmen he design'd, And living taught, and dying left behind. The Crown he wore was of the pointed Thorn; In Purple he was crucify'd, not born. They who contend for Place and high Degree, Are not his Sons, but those of Zebadee. Not, but he knew the Signs of Earthly Pow'r Might well become Saint Peter's Successor: The holy Father holds a double Reign, The Prince may keep his Pomp, the Fisher must be plain. Such was the Saint, who shone with ev'ry Grace, Reflecting, Moses-like, his Maker's Face. God saw his Image lively was express'd; And his own Work, as in Creation, bless'd. The Tempter saw him too, with envious Eye; And, as on Job, demanded Leave to try. He took the Time, when Richard was depos'd, And high and low with happy Harry clos'd. This Prince, tho' great in Arms, the Priest withstood. Near tho' he was, yet not the next of Blood. Had Richard, unconstrain'd, resign'd the Throne; A King can give no more than is his own: The Title stood entail'd, had Richard had a Son. Conquest, an odious Name, was laid aside, Where all submitted; none the Battle try'd. The senseless Plea of Right by Providence, Was by a flatt'ring Priest invented since; And lasts no longer than the present Sway, But justifies the next who comes in Play. The People's Right remains; let those who dare, Dispute their Pow'r, when they the Judges are. He join'd not in their Choice, because he knew Worse might, and often did, from Change ensue. Much to himself he thought, but little spoke; And, undepriv'd, his Benefice forsook. Now, through the Land, his Cure of Souls he stretch'd; And like a primitive Apostle preach'd Still chearful; ever constant to his Call; By many follow'd; lov'd by most, admir'd by all. With what he beg'd, his Brethren he reliev'd; And gave the Charities himself receiv'd. Gave, while he Taught; and edify'd the more, Because he shew'd, by Proof, 'twas easy to be Poor. He went not with the Croud, to see a Shrine; But fed us by the Way with Food Divine. In Def'rence to his Virtues, I might spare To show you what the Rest in Orders were: This Brilliant is so spotless, and so bright, He needs no Foil; but shines by his own proper Light. THE PLOWMAN, &amp;c. By Mr. BETTERTON. A Plowman follow'd, who had still at hand Loads of Manure t'enrich the grateful Land; An able, strong, laborious Man was he, Who liv'd with all in perfect Charity: He serv'd God faithfully, nor hoarded Pelf, But lov'd his Neighbour equal with himself, Hard would he work, and freely would he give; And oft, for God's Sake, did the Poor relieve; In Dealing just, with Losses not dismay'd; In ev'ry Kind his Tithes he duly paid; In a short Coat he rode without a Sleeve. There was beside, a Miller and a Reve, A Sumner and a Pardon-monger too, A Steward, and Myself, were all the Crew. THE MILLER. The Miller, hardy as his own Mill-stones, With brawny Flesh, large Sinews and strong Bones. His Strength to all the Town was known too well, In Wrestling still he bore away the Bell. Short Shoulder'd, knotty as a stubborn Oak, Hard to be bent, and harder to be broke: Not one, so far as he, cou'd pitch a Bar, Or lift a Weight, or swing it in the Air. He'd running force a Door, with his hard Head; His Beard, like any Fox's Tail, was red, But straight, and even as a Gard'ner's Spade. Just at the End of his huge Nose he had A large black Wart, on that a Tuft of Hairs, Red, as the Bristles of an old Sow's Ears. His Nostrils, like a Furnace, black and wide; A Sword and Buckler hanging on his Side. A Babbler, with a gormandizing Throat; And leach'rous as a Monkey or a Goat. Corn he cou'd steal, the same Corn thrice he toll'd; And yet, they say, he had a Thumb of Gold. His Coat was white, on Bagpipes he cou'd play, And with that Musick brought us on our Way. THE Manciple, or Temple-Treasurer. A Steward of the Temple next must come, A Pattern for all Caterers in Town. The Price of ev'ry thing, each Market had, He knew, and nicely pick'd the Good from Bad. Sometimes he went on trust, and sometimes paid, Yet none cou'd over-reach him in his Trade. Some wonder much, how an unletter'd Man, Of such low, sordid Education, can (Who is but One to more than three times Ten) O'er-reach so many Grave, Wise, Learned Men. A practis'd Lawyer, all things understands Th' Affairs of half the Nation pass their Hands. We praise unjustly, partially condemn, As they cheat others, others cozen them. By various Methods all Professions live, By their wise Management he learn'd to thrive. In Life's long Course, such diff'rent Ways we run, Some to undo, but most to be undone. THE REVE, or STEWARD. The Reve, a little, slender, chol'rick thing, His Face shav'd close, and not a Hair on Chin. His Locks above his Ears, an Inch at least, And dock'd before like any Begging Priest. His active Legs were very long and lean, Streight as a Staff, no Calf was to be seen. No Auditor e'er found him in the wrong, A good Accomptant, tho' his Bills were long. Well judg'd he by the Drought, and by the Rain, The future Product of his Seed and Grain. He kept due Tale of Oxen, Sheep and Swine, His Lord's March Beer, and his more precious Wine. All Rents receiv'd, for all things did engage, And manag'd since his Master came to Age. O'er ev'ry Under-Bailiff he had Spies, Knew all their Cunning, all their Knaveries: His House lay tight, and kept in good Repair, Beside a Heath, and in a healthy Air; Close in a Corner, couch'd behind a Row Of spreading Trees; the Building snug and low. The Man was warm, with Wealth in private stor'd, And abler far to purchase than his Lord. He knew his Honour's Humor to a Hair, When it was fit to ask, or to forbear. Whene'er his Lordship wanted a Supply, He with a busy careful Face wou'd fly, Run here and there, then bring the Luggage home, And only help his Master to his own. He (as those gen'rous Lords are us'd to do) Not only thanks him, but rewards him too. This Steward rode upon a sturdy Jade, And on his Side he wore a rusty Blade. A Wheelwright he had been, in Norfolk known, In all the Villages near Baldswell Town. Tuck'd round his Waist, like any Fry'r was he, And still rode hindmost of the Company. THE SUMNER, or APPARITOR. This Sumner was not overstock'd with Grace, He had a Bloated, Broad, Cherubic Face, Of fiery Hue, with hollow Eyes and narrow, Red as a Cock, and leach'rous as a Sparrow: Black were his Eye-Brows, bristled was his Beard, And much the Children his stern Visage fear'd. His Nose with Carbuncles was overspread. His Cheeks with white Welks on a Ground of red. No inward Med'cine, he cou'd e'er procure, Had Pow'r sufficient to effect their Cure. Not new Quick-silver, with Ceruse too, Brimstone, nor Oyl of Tartar, aught cou'd do. Strong bloody Wine he lov'd, and well dress'd Fish, And stunk of Garlick like a Spanish Dish. When he was drunk, he'd talk a Man to Death, And belch out Latin with unsav'ry Breath. Two or three common Fragments he cou'd say; No Wonder, for he heard it all the Day. But if you press'd him farther, you might see A sudden End of his Philosophy. A leud young Fellow, for a Quart of Wine, Might for a Twelvemonth have his Concubine. He taught his loose Companions in their Sport, T'evade the Censure of th' Archdeacon's Court. But if a rich libid'nous Prize he found, Him he inclos'd within his bawdy Pound. This, as no vulgar Secret, he wou'd tell, A large full Purse is the Archdeacon's Hell. If rich Mens Souls, within their Purses lie, 'Tis just their Sins be punish'd there, say I. To him all Wenches in the Bishop's See Paid publick Tribute, or a private Fee. Boldly he rode, a Garland on his Head, Of all unmarry'd Men and Maids the Dread. THE PARDONER. A Pardon-Monger last brought up the Rear, With Patriarchal face, and holy Leer. His Hair was of the Hue of yellow Wax, Strait and unequal as a Striek of Flax. Yet long, and thin it grew from his large Head, And all his brawny Shoulders overspread. Divided into Parcels here and there, No gaudy Hood conceal'd his golden Hair. For that, with Care, was in his Wallet laid, Where many Curiosities he had. Except a little Cap, he rode all bare, With glaring Eyes, like a new started Hare: A holy Figure stitch'd upon his Cap, His Wallet hung before him on his Lap, Stuff'd and cramm'd full of Pardons, newly come, For greedy Zealots, piping hot from Rome. Shrill was his Voice, as any Mountain Goat; Aloud he said his Orisons by rote. A Beard he never had, nor e'er will have, No Barber took the Pains, that Chin to shave. He might have been a Gelding, or a Mare, But never sure, from Berwick e'en to Ware, Was Pard'ner furnish'd with such precious Geer: For in his Male he had a Pillow-bier, Which piously was thought our Lady's Veil; He kept, beside, a Gobbet of the Sail Which Peter had (and now this Pard'ner hath) When Christ rebuked him for little Faith. A Cross he show'd of Tin, set full of Stones, And in a Glass, a Number of Pigs Bones. With these, more Pardons daily he'd dispense, In one poor Village wou'd collect more Pence, (As by Record too plainly does appear) Than a poor Parson lab'ring all the Year. Then, with feign'd Flatteries and holy Tools, He made the Parson and the People Fools. Howe'er, to tell the Truth just as it stood, He seem'd in Church Ecclesiastick good. A Lesson he cou'd read, or tell a Story, And roar the Psalter with no little Glory. But best of all, an Offertory sung, So loud, so chearful, that the Chapel rung. This gain'd him Pence from the deluded Croud, Therefore he sung so chearful, and so loud. End of the Characters of the Pilgrims. PROLOGUE TO THE Knight's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. What needs there more our Pilgrims to describe, Our Southwark Guests? A mix'd, but merry Tribe. Their various Looks and Talents to display? Their Sex and Age? Their Number and Array? Whom pious Zeal, or fashionable Course, Drew from their Homes, here resting Man and Horse. Here well to rest! As Trav'lers witness well, A friendly House! The Tabarde by the Bell. And here it falls in Order to recite, First, how in social Cheer we pass'd the Night; Next how, with common Voice, and early Day, Our Troop to Canterbury took their Way; And last the Progress of our Pilgrims tell; With each Adventure duly as it fell. But let me first your due Indulgence claim, Lest this my Freedom you unjustly blame; Where loose the Subject, or where rude the Speech: For we pretend to copy, not to teach. Who tells Another's Tale, in Verse or Prose, Nigh as He can shou'd ev'ry Word disclose; For be it ne'er so wanton, or at large, Such are the Facts, and you must give the Charge. This Rule infring'd (by Law and Reason known) The Tale is not Another's, but your Own. All Evidence is strict, all Trial plain, A Witness shou'd repeat, but never feign. If new the Conduct, or the Language new; The Stamp re-touch'd, the Coinage is untrue. To This, Whate'er the Standard Sense affords, Requires exact Similitude of Words. Apt Words are shap'd, fix'd Objects to express; For Language is no more than Nature's Dress. If some that Love's exalted Colors wear, Capriciously offend the virtuous Ear; Or heedlessly the Virgin Cheek inflame, 'Tis faulty Modesty! Mistaken Shame! If right the Laws that free-born Tongues inslave, And force to veil what Nature publick gave, Then Nature err'd, deform'd the Human Frame With Parts dishonest, horrible to Name! But that great Nature err'd! Who dares pretend? Why, shou'd the just Description then offend? Form'd by the wisest Plan each Part is found, And Voice was giv'n to fit each Part to Sound. Hence various Words by well-tun'd Accents wrought, Stamp on the Ears the Figures of the Thought, And fix the airy Progress e'er it flies, As Painting is the Language of the Eyes. The Skilfull Artist, lab'ring to display The bright Effulgence of Meridian Day, With strongest Colours strikes the burnish'd Light, The darker Shades reserv'd for Sullen Night. The Poet thus that treats of am'rous Wile, Or wanton Theft, must heighten all his Stile, To raise warm Passions, warm Descriptions raise, And keep for cooler Sense, the cooler Phrase! Nor arbitrary deem these stated Rules, The Random Doctrines of Illib'ral Schools. The best Philosophers like Tenets hold, Christian and Heathen! Both the New and Old. Read Plato, Plato says (if Thou canst read) “The Word must be adapted to the Deed.” And oft full broad the Phrase of Holy Writ, Heathen and Christian must this Truth admit. Others perhaps, with happier Talents blest, Our Breach of due Decorum may contest: In Poems well dispos'd they may maintain, Rank shou'd be kept, as in a public Train. And None too forward, None too backward stand; But Band, with due Distinctions, follow Band. “Nor Rank, nor File, our rude Militia mind, “Some stray, 'tis true, before, and some behind.” If This excuse not; on the Truth We rest, “Low was our Genius, and We did our Best. “And tho' a Fault, I speak without Offence) “Yet sure a Venial Fault, is Want of Sense.” But to return. Great Joy our Host express'd, Thrice-heartily He welcom'd ev'ry Guest. And goodly Cheer prepar'd with equal Haste; (He of two Ills had rather pray than fast.) Nor less, the Plague or Comfort of his Life, Judge as Ye list! His busy-stirring Wife. Anon was Supper serv'd, and neatly drest, In Season ev'ry Dish, and of the Best. Strong was the Ale, with Toast and Nutmeg crown'd, Pure was the Wine! And both went briskly round. Frank was our Host. A comely Man withal, A Marshall fit for any noble Hall, Where many a graceless Page is left in Charge, Round was his Body, nor more round than large. His sturdy Legs, tho' slow, just Measure keep! A fairer Burgess never trod the Cheap! Tho' bold of Speech; Yet not more bold than wise! His Wits awake, and watchful as his Eyes! Loud when He laugh'd! and hearty when He spoke! His Voice was Mirth! His very Look a Joke! When now the Rage of Hunger was allay'd; And, what more joy'd our Host, our Reck'ning paid. “Thrice welcome (He began) both Great and Small! “Bright Lords and Ladies fair! Thrice welcome all! “Full many a Noon has pass'd, full many a Night, “Since in this Inn appear'd so brave a Sight. “A braver, never wish these Eyes to see! “Such Guests! so full of Honor and of Glee! “Fain wou'd I raise your Mirth, had I but Skill; “Or were my Talent equal to my Will. “Yet let not the Intent be wholly lost; “I mean not here to please You at your Cost. “To Canterbury, early You proceed; “And may the blissfull Saint your Wishes speed. “But if the Good and Bad You justly weigh, “Long must the Road, and tedious seem the Day; “For 'tis but dull to travel, You must own, “Mute as a Fish, and senseless as a Stone. “Be mine such luckless Silence to prevent; “Attend but my Award with one Consent. “For, by my Father's Body, long since dead; “Mirth You shall have, at Forfeit of my Head: “If none, my Wish too willfully withstands, “In witness of your Minds hold up your Hands!” Here waiting the Event, He ceas'd to speak; Our gen'ral Counsel was not long to seek: For why shou'd We reject his honest Suit, The Purport far from worthy the Dispute? We vote the Journey as he shou'd advise; In trivial Things, 'tis Foolish to be Wise. Then thus our Host his Speech renew'd again, “The Point, ye Nobles, take not in Disdain. “The Road to shorten, and deceive the Day, “(For Mirth makes Mirth, and Play gives Rise to Play) “I will that Each, by Turns, two Stories tell, “Of strange Adventures, which of old befell. “One e'er Your each Saint Thomas' sacred Shrine; “And one, e'er You regain the Tabarde Sign. “Then farther, be it solemnly agreed; “That He, that in his Place shall best succeed: “Whose Close is held most just, whose Phrase most fit, “For Profit or Delight, for Sense or Wit. “His be a Supper at the common Cost; “Here, in this Host'lry, sitting by this Post. “And more, to aid your Sport, myself will ride, “And be at once your Governor and Guide; “Content the shar'd Expences to maintain; “Not grudgingly. Such Company is Gain. “But first enact; that He that disobeys “My Will, the common Charge, convicted pays. “This is my Verdict. E'er We further go, “Pass Sentence, One and All! Your Aye, or No!” Consent, from One and All, the Question bore; And jointly, as our Host requir'd, We swore. Nay more, We vote Him in the Chair of State, Sole Umpire of the Tales We should relate. Submiss in All to follow his Advice, We fix a Supper at a stated Price. Pleas'd was our Host; Success improves Design! Pleas'd were the Guests; and loud they call'd for Wine. Smooth ev'ry Brow, and easy every Breast; Each took his cordial Draught, and went to Rest. When scarce the blushing Morn had streak'd the Skies With earliest Day, our Host began to rise; And strait his Guests he gather'd in a Flock, As stirs his Common Mates the feather'd Cock. Then forth We sally'd with an easy Pace, Some low of Spirits, sober most of Face: Till jointly, to the Sacred Ford we came, Known, good Saint Thomas, by thy Guardian Name. There, at thy Stream, to many a thirsty Steed Free-giv'n, our Host, forebade us to proceed. And, silencing a-while his jingling Bit, Arrests his Horse; All readily submit; And circle him around on ev'ry Side: When loud as any Chanter thus he cry'd. “As Morning Song, and Ev'ning Song agree, “Both High and Low attend to my Decree, “Pay here such Duty as by Vote you pass'd, “Then sweetly shall we chime from first to last. “Be this the Spot to cast the foremost Tale; “And may these Lips nor relish Wine nor Ale “(What more I dread, or dread not less than Death; “For want of Liquor is like Want of Breath.) “As he that dares against my Will offend, “Pays All, (for thus you swore) that All expend. “Now Chance decide, who loses, or who wins! “Who draws the shortest Lot, the first begins. “Sir Knight, he said, my Master and my Lord, “Draw forth, I mean your Fortune, not your Sword! “And gentle Dame, with one Accord appear, “Come near, my Lady Prioress, come near! “And you, Sir Clerk, look up, take Heart of Grace; “Put off that Book-learn'd Bashfulness of Face! “And Males and Females, all, alike lay Hand.” And all alike submit to his Command. Suffice, that on the Knight the Forfeit fell; Or were it Chance, or Fate; who knows may tell. Nor know We, nor can tell; yet, for the Best, Suppose, it fortun'd. Glad were all the rest: As tho' not freed, yet of their Burthen eas'd: Nor seem'd the noble Knight in Look displeas'd, Or griev'd in Thought: The noble Knight was wise: Whether Concern he cover'd with Disguise, Or from Experience had acquir'd Content. For Care is vain, unless it can prevent. “If then, by Me, the Sport must be begun, “Thrice welcome Lot (he said) not lost but won! “Then, ride and listen, to the Croud, he cry'd;” And, at the Word, We listen, as We ride. While, nor with vulgar Speech, nor Gesture rude, This Tale of Love and Honour he pursu'd. End of the Prologue to the Knight's Tale. Palamon and Arcite: OR, THE KNIGHT's Tale. By Mr. DRYDEN. In Days of old, there liv'd, of mighty Fame, A valiant Prince; and Theseus was his Name: A Chief, who more in Feats of Arms excell'd, The Rising nor the Setting Sun beheld, Of Athens he was Lord; much Land he won, And added foreign Countries to his Crown: In Scythia with the Warrior Queen he strove, Whom first by Force he conquer'd, then by Love. He brought in Triumph back the beauteous Dame, With whom her Sister, fair Emilia, came. With Honor to his Home let Theseus ride, With Love to Friend, and Fortune for his Guide, And his victorious Army at his Side. I pass their warlike Pomp, their proud Array, Their Shouts, their Songs, their Welcome on the Way: But, were it not too long, I would recite The Feats of Amazons, the fatal Fight Betwixt the hardy Queen, and Heroe Knight; The Town besieg'd, and how much Blood it cost The Female Army, and th' Athenian Host; The Spousals of Hippolita the Queen; What Tilts and Turneys at the Feast were seen; The Storm at their Return, the Ladies Fear: But these, and other Things, I must forbear. The Field is spacious I design to sow, With Oxen far unfit to draw the Plow: The Remnant of my Tale is of a Length To tire your Patience, and to waste my Strength; And trivial Accidents shall be forborn, That others may have Time to take their Turn; As was at first enjoin'd us by mine Host: That he whose Tale is best, and pleases most, Should win his Supper at our common Cost. And therefore, where I left I will pursue, This ancient Story, whether false or true, In hope it may be mended with a new. The Prince I mention'd, full of high Renown, In this Array drew near th' Athenian Town; When in his Pomp and utmost of his Pride, Marching, he chanc'd to cast his Eye aside, And saw a Choir of mourning Dames, who lay By Two and Two a-cross the common Way: At his Approach they rais'd a rueful Cry, And beat their Breasts, and held their Hands on high. Creeping and crying, till they seiz'd at last His Courser's Bridle, and his Feet embrac'd. “Tell me, said Theseus, what and whence you are, “And why this Fun'ral Pageant you prepare? “Is this the Welcome of my worthy Deeds, “To meet my Triumph in ill-omen'd Weeds? “Or envy you my Praise, and would destroy “With Grief my Pleasures, and pollute my Joy? “Or are you injur'd, and demand Relief? “Name your Request, and I will ease your Grief.” The most in Years of all the Mourning Train Began; (but swooned first away for Pain) Then scarce recover'd, spoke: ‘Nor envy we ‘Thy great Renown, nor grudge thy Victory; ‘'Tis thine, O King, th' Afflicted to redress, ‘And Fame has fill'd the World with thy Success: ‘We wretched Women sue for that alone, ‘Which of thy Goodness is refus'd to none: ‘Let fall some Drops of Pity on our Grief, ‘If what we beg be just, and we deserve Relief: ‘For none of us, who now thy Grace implore, ‘But held the Rank of Sovereign Queen before; ‘Till, Thanks to giddy Chance, which never bears, ‘That Mortal Bliss should last for length of Years, ‘She cast us headlong from our high Estate, ‘And here in hope of thy Return we wait: ‘And long have waited in the Temple nigh, ‘Built to the gracious Goddess Clemency. ‘But rev'rence thou the Pow'r whose Name it bears, ‘Relieve th' Oppress'd, and wipe the Widow's Tears. ‘I, wretched I, have other Fortune seen, ‘The Wife of Capaneus, and once a Queen: ‘At Thebes he fell; curst be the fatal Day! ‘And all the rest thou seest in this Array, ‘To make their Moan, their Lords in Battle lost ‘Before that Town, besieg'd by our Confed'rate Host: ‘But Creon, old and impious, who commands ‘The Theban City, and usurps the Lands, ‘Denies the Rites of Fun'ral Fires to those ‘Whose breathless Bodies yet he calls his Foes. ‘Unburn'd, unbury'd, on a Heap they lie; ‘Such is their Fate, and such his Tyranny; ‘No Friend has leave to bear away the Dead, ‘But with their lifeless Limbs his Hounds are fed: At this she shriek'd aloud; the mournful Train Echo'd her Grief, and grov'ling on the Plain With Groans, and Hands upheld, to move his Mind Besought his Pity to their helpless Kind! The Prince was touch'd, his Tears began to flow, And, as his tender Heart would break in two, He sigh'd; and could not but their Fate deplore, So wretched now, so fortunate before. Then lightly from his lofty Steed he flew, And raising one by one the suppliant Crew, To comfort each, full solemnly he swore, That by the Faith which Knights to Knighthood bore, And what e'er else to Chivalry belongs, He would not cease, till he reveng'd their Wrongs: That Greece should see perform'd what he declar'd; And cruel Creon find his just Reward. He said no more, but shunning all Delay, Rode on; nor enter'd Athens on his Way: But left his Sister and his Queen behind, And wav'd his Royal Banner in the Wind: Where in an Argent Field the God of War Was drawn triumphant on his Iron Car; Red was his Sword, and Shield, and whole Attire, And all the Godhead seem'd to glow with Fire; Ev'n the Ground glitter'd where the Standard flew, And the green Grass was dy'd to sanguine Hue. High on his pointed Lance his Pennon bore His Cretan Fight, the conquer'd Minotaur: The Soldiers shout around with gen'rous Rage, And in that Victory their own presage. He prais'd their Ardour: inly pleas'd to see His Host the Flow'r of Grecian Chivalry. All Day he march'd; and all th' ensuing Night; And saw the City with returning Light. The Process of the War I need not tell, How Theseus conquer'd, and how Creon fell: Or after, how by Storm the Walls were won, Or how the Victor sack'd and burn'd the Town: How to the Ladies he restor'd again The Bodies of their Lords in Battle slain: And with what ancient Rites they were interr'd; All these to fitter Time shall be deferr'd: I spare the Widows Tears, their woful Cries, And Howling at their Husbands Obsequies; How Theseus at these Fun'rals did assist, And with what Gifts the mourning Dames dismiss'd. Thus when the Victor Chief had Creon slain, And conquer'd Thebes, he pitch'd upon the Plain His mighty Camp, and when the Day return'd, The Country wasted, and the Hamlets burn'd; And left the Pillagers, to Rapine bred, Without Controul to strip and spoil the Dead: There, in a Heap of Slain, among the rest Two youthful Knights they found beneath a Load oppress'd Of slaughter'd Foes, whom first to Death they sent, The Trophies of their Strength, a bloody Monument. Both fair, and both of Royal Blood they seem'd, Whom Kinsmen to the Crown the Heralds deem'd; That Day in equal Arms they fought for Fame; Their Swords, their Shields, their Surcoats were the same. Close by each other laid, they press'd the Ground, Their manly Bosoms pierc'd with many a griesly Wound; Nor well alive, nor wholly dead they were, But some faint Signs of feeble Life appear: The wand'ring Breath was on the Wing to part, Weak was the Pulse, and hardly heav'd the Heart. These two were Sister's Sons; and Arcite one, Much fam'd in Fields, with valiant Palamon. From these their costly Arms the Spoilers rent, And softly both convey'd to Theseus' Tent; Whom known of Greon's Line, and cur'd with Care, He to his City sent as Pris'ners of the War, Hopeless of Ransom, and condemn'd to lie In Durance, doom'd a ling'ring Death to die. This done, he march'd away with warlike Sound, And to his Athens turn'd with Laurels crown'd, Where happy long he liv'd, much lov'd, and more renown'd. But in a Tow'r, and never to be loos'd, The woful captive Kinsmen are inclos'd: Thus Year by Year they pass, and Day by Day, Till once ('twas on the Morn of chearful May) The young Emilia, fairer to be seen Than the fair Lily on the Flow'ry Green, More fresh than May herself in Blossoms new (For with the Rosy Colour strove her Hue) Wak'd, as her Custom was, before the Day, To do th' Observance due to sprightly May: For sprightly May commands our Youth to keep The Vigils of her Night, and breaks their sluggard Sleep. Each gentle Breast with kindly Warmth she moves: Inspires new Flames, revives extinguish'd Loves; In this Remembrance Emily e're Day Arose, and dress'd herself in rich Array. Fresh as the Month, and as the Morning fair: Adown her Shoulders fell her length of Hair: A Ribband did the braided Tresses bind, The rest was loose, and wanton'd in the Wind: Aurora had but newly chas'd the Night, And purpled o'er the Sky with blushing Light, When to the Garden-walk she took her way, To sport and trip along in Cool of Day, And offer Maiden Vows in Honor of the May. At ev'ry Turn, she made a little Stand, And thrust among the Thorns her Lily Hand To draw the Rose, and ev'ry Rose she drew She shook the Stalk, and brush'd away the Dew: Then party-colour'd Flow'rs of white and red She wove, to make a Garland for her Head: This done, she sung and caroll'd out so clear, That Men and Angels might rejoice to hear. Ev'n wond'ring Philomel forgot to sing; And learn'd from Her to welcome in the Spring. The Tow'r, of which before was Mention made, Within whose Keep the Captive Knights were laid, Built of a large Extent, and strong withal, Was one Partition of the Palace Wall: The Garden was inclos'd within the Square, Where young Emilia took the Morning-Air. It happen'd Palamon the Pris'ner Knight, Restless for Woe, arose before the Light, And with his Jaylor's Leave desir'd to breathe An Air more wholsom than the Damps beneath. This granted, to the Tow'r he took his Way, Cheer'd with the Promise of a glorious Day: Then cast a languishing Regard around, And saw with hateful Eyes the Temples crown'd With golden Spires, and all the Hostile Ground. He sigh'd, and turn'd his Eyes, because he knew 'Twas but a larger Jail he had in View: Then look'd below, and from the Castle's Height Beheld a nearer and more pleasing Sight: The Garden which before he had not seen, In Spring's new Livery clad of White and Green, Fresh Flow'rs in wide Parterrers, and shady Walks between. This view'd, but not enjoy'd, with Arms across He stood, reflecting on his Country's Loss; Himself an Object of the Public Scorn, And often wish'd he never had been born. At last (for so his Destiny requir'd) With walking giddy, and with thinking tir'd, He thro' a little Window cast his Sight, Tho' thick of Bars, that gave a scanty Light, But ev'n that Glimm'ring serv'd him to descry Th' inevitable Charms of Emily. Scarce had he seen, but seiz'd with sudden Smart, Stung to the Quick, he felt it at his Heart; Struck blind with overpow'ring Light he stood, Then started back amaz'd, and cry'd aloud. Young Arcite heard; and up he ran with Haste, To help his Friend, and in his Arms embrac'd; And ask'd him why he look'd so deadly wan, And whence and how his Change of Cheer began? Or who had done th' Offence? “But if, said he, “Your Grief alone is hard Captivity; “For Love of Heav'n, with Patience undergo “A cureless Ill, since Fate will have it so: “So Stood our Horoscope in Chains to lie, “And Saturn in the Dungeon of the Sky, “Or other baleful Aspect, rul'd our Birth, “When all the friendly Stars were under Earth: “What e'er betides, by Destiny 'tis done; “And better bear like Men, than vainly seek to shun. ‘Nor of my Bonds, said Palamon again, ‘Nor of unhappy Planets I complain; ‘But when my mortal Anguish caus'd my Cry, ‘That Moment I was hurt thro' either Eye; ‘Pierc'd with a Random-shaft, I faint away, ‘And perish with insensible Decay: ‘A Glance of some new Goddess gave the Wound, ‘Whom, like Actæon, unaware I found. ‘Look how she walks along yon shady Space, ‘Not Juno moves with more Majestick Grace; ‘And all the Cyprian Queen is in her Face. ‘If thou art Venus, (for thy Charms confess ‘That Face was form'd in Heav'n) nor art thou less, ‘Disguis'd in Habit, undisguis'd in Shape; ‘O help us Captives from our Chains to 'scape! ‘But if our Doom be past in Bonds to lie ‘For Life, and in a loathsom Dungeon die, ‘Then be thy Wrath appeas'd with our Disgrace, ‘And show Compassion to the Theban Race. ‘Oppress'd by Tyrant Pow'r!’ While yet he spoke, Arcite on Emily had fix'd his Look; The fatal Dart a ready Passage found, And deep within his Heart infix'd the Wound: So that if Palamon were wounded sore, Arcite was hurt as much as he, or more: Then from his inmost Soul he sigh'd and said, “The Beauty I beheld has struck me dead: “Unknowingly she strikes; and kills by chance; “Poison is in her Eyes, and Death in ev'ry Glance. “O, I must ask; nor ask alone, but move “Her Mind to Mercy, or must die for Love.” Thus Arcite: And thus Palamon replies, (Eager his Tone, and ardent were his Eyes.) ‘Speak'st thou in earnest, or in jesting Vein?’ “Jesting, said Arcite, suits but ill with Pain.” ‘It suits far worse (said Palamon again, ‘And bent his Brows) with Men who Honor weigh ‘Their Faith to break, their Friendship to betray; ‘But worst with Thee, of Noble Lineage born, ‘My Kinsman, and in Arms my Brother sworn. ‘Have we not plighted each our holy Oath, ‘That one shou'd be the Common Good of both? ‘One Soul shou'd both inspire, and neither prove ‘His Fellow's Hind'rance in Pursuit of Love? ‘To this before the Gods we gave our Hands, ‘And nothing but our Death can break the Bands. ‘This binds thee, then, to further my Design; ‘As I am bound by Vow to further thine: ‘Nor canst, nor dar'st thou, Traitor, on the Plain ‘Appeach my Honor, or thine own maintain. ‘Since thou art of my Council, and the Friend ‘Whose Faith I trust, and on whose Care depend: ‘And woud'st thou court my Lady's Love, which I ‘Much rather than release, wou'd choose to die? ‘But thou, false Arcite, never shalt obtain ‘Thy bad Pretence; I told thee first my Pain: ‘For first my Love began e're thine was born; ‘Thou as my Council, and my Brother sworn, ‘Art bound t'assist my Eldership of Right, ‘Or justly to be deem'd a perjur'd Knight.’ Thus Palamon: But Arcite with Disdain In haughty Language thus reply'd again: “Forsworn thy self: The Traitor's odious Name “I first return, and then disprove thy Claim. “If Love be Passion, and that Passion nurst “With strong Desires, I lov'd the Lady first. “Canst thou pretend Desire, whom Zeal inflam'd “To worship, and a Pow'r Celestial nam'd? “Thine was Devotion to the Blest above, “I saw the Woman, and desir'd her Love; “First own'd my Passion, and to thee commend “Th' important Secret, as my chosen Friend. “Suppose (which yet I grant not) thy Desire “A Moment elder than my Rival Fire; “Can Chance of seeing first thy Title prove? “And know'st thou not, no Law is made for Love? “Law is to Things which to free Choice relate; “Love is not in our Choice, but in our Fate; “Laws are but positive: Love's Pow'r, we see, “Is Nature's Sanction; and her first Decree. “Each Day we break the Bond of Human Laws “For Love, and vindicate the Common Cause. “Laws for Defence of Civil Rights are plac'd, “Love throws the Fences down, and makes a gen'ral Waste; “Maids, Widows, Wives, without Distinction fall; “The sweeping Deluge, Love, comes on, and covers all. “If then the Laws of Friendship I transgress, “I keep the Greater, while I break the Less; “And both are mad alike, since neither can possess. “Both hopeless to be ransom'd, never more “To see the Sun, but as he passes o'er. “Like Æsop's Hounds contending for the Bone, “Each pleaded Right, and wou'd be Lord alone: “The fruitless Fight continu'd all the Day; “A Cur came by, and snatch'd the Prize away. “As Courtiers therefore justle for a Grant, “And, when they break their Friendship, plead their Want: “So thou, if Fortune will thy Suit advance, “Love on; nor envy me my equal Chance: “For I must love, and am resolv'd to try “My Fate, or, failing in th' Adventure die.” Great was their Strife, which hourly was renew'd, Till each with mortal Hate his Rival view'd: Now Friends no more, nor walking Hand in Hand; But when they met, they made a surly Stand; And glar'd like angry Lions as they pass'd, And wish'd that ev'ry Look might be their last. It chanc'd at length Pirithous came, t'attend This worthy Theseus, his familiar Friend: Their Love in early Infancy began, And rose as Childhood ripen'd into Man. Companions of the War; and lov'd so well, That when one dy'd, as ancient Stories tell, His Fellow to redeem him went to Hell. But to pursue my Tale; to welcome home His Warlike Brother is Pirithous come: Arcite of Thebes was known in Arms long since, And honor'd by this young Thessalian Prince. Theseus, to gratify his Friend and Guest, Who made our Arcite's Freedom his Request, Restor'd to Liberty the Captive Knight, But on these hard Conditions I recite: That if hereafter Arcite should be found Within the Compass of Athenian Ground, By Day or Night, or on whate'er Pretence, His Head shou'd pay the Forfeit of th' Offence. To this, Pirithous, for his Friend agreed, And on his Promise was the Pris'ner freed. Unpleas'd and pensive hence he takes his Way, At his own Peril; for his Life must pay. Who now but Arcite mourns his bitter Fate, Finds his dear Purchase, and repents too late? “What have I gain'd, he said, in Prison pent, “If I but change my Bonds for Banishment? “And banish'd from her Sight, I suffer more “In Freedom, than I felt in Bonds before: “Forc'd from her Presence, and condemn'd to live: “Unwelcome Freedom, and unthank'd Reprieve! “Heav'n is not, but where Emily abides, “And where she's absent, all is Hell besides. “Next to my Day of Birth, was that accurst “Which bound my Friendship to Pirithous first: “Had I not known that Prince, I still had been “In Bondage, and had still Emilia seen: “For tho' I never can her Grace deserve, “'Tis Recompence enough to see and serve. “O Palamon, my Kinsman and my Friend, “How much more happy Fates thy Love attend! “Thine is th' Adventure, thine the Victory: “Well has thy Fortune turn'd the Dice for thee: “Thou on that Angel's Face may'st feed thy Eyes; “In Prison? no; but blisful Paradise! “Thou daily seest that Sun of Beauty shine, “And lov'st at least in Love's extremest Line. “I mourn in Absence, Love's Eternal Night: “And who can tell, but since thou hast her Sight, “And art a comely, young and valiant Knight, “Fortune (a various Pow'r) may cease to frown, “And by some Ways unknown thy Wishes crown? “But I, the most forlorn of Human-kind, “Nor Help can hope, nor Remedy can find; “But doom'd to drag my loathsome Life in Care, “For my Reward, must end it in Despair. “Fire, Water, Air and Earth, and Force of Fates “That governs all, and Heav'n that all creates, “Nor Art, nor Nature's Hand can ease my Grief; “Nothing but Death, the Wretch's last Relief: “Then farewel Youth, and all the Joys that dwell “With Youth and Life, and Life itself farewel. “But why, alas! do Mortal Men in vain “Of Fortune, Fate, or Providence complain? “God gives us what he knows our Wants require, “And better Things than those which we desire: “Some pray for Riches; Riches they obtain; “But watch'd by Robbers, for their Wealth are slain. “Some pray from Prison to be freed; and come, “When guilty of their Vows, to fall at home; “Murder'd by those they trusted with their Life, “A favour'd Servant, or a Bosom Wife. “Such dear-bought Blessings happen ev'ry Day, “Because we know not for what Things to pray. “Like drunken Sots, about the Street we roam: “Well knows the Sot he has a certain Home; “Yet knows not how to find th' uncertain Place, “And blunders on, and staggers ev'ry Pace. “Thus all seek Happiness; but few can find, “For far the greater Part of Men are blind. “This is my Case, who thought our utmost Good “Was in one Word of Freedom understood: “The fatal Blessing came: From Prison free, “I starve abroad, and lose the Sight of Emily.” Thus Arcite; but if Arcite thus deplore His Suff'rings, Palamon yet suffers more. For when he knew his Rival freed and gone, He swells with Wrath; he makes outrageous Moan: He frets, he fumes, he stares, he stamps the Ground; The hollow Tow'r with Clamours rings around: With briny Tears he bath'd his fetter'd Feet, And dropp'd all o'er with Agony of Sweat. ‘Alas! he cry'd, I Wretch in Prison pine, ‘Too happy Rival, while the Fruit is thine: ‘Thou liv'st at large, thou draw'st thy native Air, ‘Pleas'd with thy Freedom, proud of my Despair: ‘Thou may'st, since thou hast Youth and Courage join'd, ‘A sweet Behaviour and a solid Mind, ‘Assemble ours, and all the Theban Race, ‘To vindicate on Athens thy Disgrace: ‘And after, (by some Treaty made) possess ‘Fair Emily, the Pledge of lasting Peace. ‘So thine shall be the beauteous Prize, while I ‘Must languish in Despair, in Prison die. ‘Thus all th' Advantage of the Strife is thine, ‘Thy Portion double Joys, and double Sorrows mine. The Rage of Jealousy then fir'd his Soul, And his Face kindled like a burning Coal: Now cold Despair, succeeding in her stead, To livid Paleness turns the glowing Red. His Blood scarce liquid, creeps within his Veins, Like Water which the freezing Wind constrains. Then thus he said: ‘Eternal Deities, ‘Who rule the World with absolute Decrees, ‘And write whatever Time shall bring to pass, ‘With Pens of Adamant on Plates of Brass; ‘What, is the Race of Human Kind your Care ‘Beyond what all his Fellow-Creatures are? ‘He with the rest is liable to Pain, ‘And like the Sheep, his Brother-Beast, is slain. ‘Cold, Hunger, Prisons, Ills without a Cure, ‘All these he must, and guiltless oft, endure: ‘Or does your Justice, Pow'r, or Prescience fail, ‘When the Good suffer, and the Bad prevail? ‘What worse to wretched Virtue could befall, ‘If Fate, or giddy Fortune govern'd all? ‘Nay, worse than other Beasts is our Estate; ‘Them, to pursue their Pleasures you create; ‘We, bound by harder Laws, must curb our Will, ‘And your Commands, not our Desires fulfil; ‘Then when the Creature is unjustly slain, ‘Yet after Death, at least, he feels no Pain. ‘But Man in Life surcharg'd with Woe before, ‘Not freed when dead, is doom'd to suffer more. ‘A Serpent shoots his Sting at unaware; ‘An ambush'd Thief forelays a Traveller: ‘The Man lies Murder'd, while the Thief and Snake, ‘One gains the Thickets, and one thrids the Brake. ‘This let Divines decide; but well I know, ‘Just, or unjust, I have my Share of Woe, ‘Through Saturn seated in a luckless Place, ‘And Juno's Wrath, that persecutes my Race; ‘Or Mars and Venus in a Quartil, move ‘My Pangs of Jealousy for Arcite's Love.’ Let Palamon oppress'd in Bondage mourn, While to his exil'd Rival we return. By this, the Sun declining from his Height, The Day had shorten'd to prolong the Night: The lengthen'd Night gave length of Misery Both to the Captive Lover, and the Free. For Palamon in endless Prison mourns, And Arcite forfeits Life if he returns. The Banish'd never hopes his Love to see, Nor hopes the Captive Lord his Liberty. 'Tis hard to say who suffers greater Pains: One sees his Love, but cannot break his Chains: One freed, and all his Actions uncontroll'd, Beholds whate'er he wou'd, but what he wou'd behold. Judge as you please, for I will haste to tell What Fortune to the banish'd Knight befel. When Arcite was to Thebes return'd again, The Loss of her he lov'd renew'd his Pain; What cou'd be worse, than never more to see His Life, his Soul, his charming Emily? He rav'd with all the Madness of Despair, He roar'd, he beat his Breast, he tore his Hair. Dry Sorrow in his stupid Eyes appears, For wanting Nourishment, he wanted Tears: His Eye-balls in their hollow Sockets sink; Bereft of Sleep, he loaths his Meat and Drink. He withers at his Heart, and looks as wan As the pale Spectre of a murder'd Man: That Pale turns Yellow, and his Face receives The faded Hue of sapless Boxen Leaves: In solitary Groves he makes his Moan, Walks early out, and ever is alone. Nor mix'd in Mirth, in youthful Pleasure shares, But sighs when Songs and Instruments he hears: His Spirits are so low, his Voice is drown'd, He hears as from afar, or in a Swoon, Like the deaf Murmurs of a distant Sound: Uncomb'd his Locks, and squalid his Attire, Unlike the Trim of Love and gay Desire; But full of museful Mopings, which presage The Loss of Reason, and conclude in Rage. This when he had endur'd a Year and more, Now wholly chang'd from what he was before, It happen'd once, that slumb'ring as he lay, He dreamt (his Dream began at Break of Day) That Hermes o'er his Head in Air appear'd, And with soft Words his drooping Spirits chear'd: His Hat, adorn'd with Wings, disclos'd the God, And in his Hand he bore the Sleep-compelling Rod: Such as he seem'd, when at his Sire's Command On Argus' Head he laid the Snaky Wand; “Arise, he said, to conqu'ring Athens go, “There Fate appoints an End to all thy Woe.” The Fright awaken'd Arcite with a Start, Against his Bosom bounc'd his heaving Heart; But soon he said, with scarce-recover'd Breath, “And thither will I go, to meet my Death, “Sure to be slain; but Death is my Desire, “Since in Emilia's Sight I shall expire.” By Chance he spy'd a Mirrour while he spoke, And gazing there, beheld his alter'd Look; Wond'ring, he saw his Features and his Hue So much were chang'd, that scarce himself he knew. A sudden Thought then starting in his Mind, “Since I in Arcite cannot Arcite find, “The World may search in vain with all their Eyes, “But never penetrate thro' this Disguise. “Thanks to the Change which Grief and Sickness give; “In low Estate I may securely live, “And see unknown my Mistress Day by Day:” He said; and cloth'd himself in coarse Array: A lab'ring Hind in shew: Then forth he went, And to th' Athenian Tow'rs his Journey bent: One Squire attended in the same Disguise, Made conscious of his Master's Enterprize. Arriv'd at Athens, soon he came to Court, Unknown, unquestion'd in that thick Resort; Proff'ring for Hire his Service at the Gate, To drudge, draw Water, and to run or wait. So fair befel him, that for little Gain He serv'd at first Emilia's Chamberlain; And watchful all Advantages to spy, Was still at Hand, and in his Master's Eye; And as his Bones were big and Sinews strong, Refus'd no Toil that cou'd to Slaves belong; But from deep Wells with Engines Water drew, And us'd his noble Hands the Wood to hew. He pass'd a Year at least attending thus On Emily, and call'd Philostratus. But never was there Man of his Degree So much esteem'd, so well-belov'd as he. So gentle of Condition was he known, That through the Court his Courtesy was blown: All think him worthy of a greater Place; And recommend him to the Royal Grace; That exercis'd within a higher Sphere, His Virtues more conspicuous might appear. Thus by the gen'ral Voice was Arcite prais'd, And by great Theseus to high Favour rais'd; Among his Menial Servants first enroll'd, And largely entertain'd with Sums of Gold: Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent, Of his own Income, and his annual Rent. This well employ'd, he purchas'd Friends and Fame, But cautiously conceal'd from whence it came. Thus for three Years he liv'd with large Increase, In Arms of Honor, and Esteem in Peace; To Theseus' Person he was ever near; And Theseus for his Virtues held him dear. While Arcite lives in Bliss, the Story turns Where hopeless Palamon in Prison mourns. For six long Years immur'd, the Captive Knight Had dragg'd his Chains, and scarcely seen the Light: Lost Liberty and Love at once he bore: His Prison pain'd him much, his Passion more, Nor dares he hope his Fetters to remove, Nor ever wishes to be free from Love. But when the Sixth revolving Year was run, And May within the Twins receiv'd the Sun, Were it by Chance, or forceful Destiny, Which forms in Causes first whate'er shall be, Assisted by a Friend one Moonless Night, This Palamon from Prison took his Flight: A pleasant Beverage he prepar'd before Of Wine and Honey mix'd, with added Store Of Opium; to his Keeper this he brought, Who swallow'd unaware the sleepy Draught, And snor'd secure till Morn, his Senses bound In Slumber, and in long Oblivion drown'd. Short was the Night, and careful Palamon Sought the next Covert e're the Rising Sun. A thick-spread Forest near the City lay, To this with lengthen'd Strides he took his Way, (For far he cou'd not fly, and fear'd the Day.) Safe from Pursuit, he meant to shun the Light, Till the brown Shadows of the friendly Night To Thebes might favour his intended Flight. When to his Country come, this next Design Was all the Theban Race in Arms to join, And war on Theseus, till he lost his Life, Or won the beauteous Emily to Wife. Thus while his Thoughts the ling'ring Day beguile, To gentle Arcite let us turn our Stile, Who little dreamt how nigh he was to Care, Till treach'rous Fortune caught him in the Snare. The Morning-Lark, the Messenger of Day, Saluted in her Song the Morning gray; And soon the Sun arose with Beams so bright, That all th' Horizon laugh'd to see the joyous Sight; He with his tepid Rays the Rose renews, And licks the drooping Leaves, and dries the Dews; When Arcite left his Bed, resolv'd to pay Observance to the Month of merry May: Forth on his fiery Steed betimes he rode, That scarcely prints the Turf on which he trod: At ease he seem'd, and prancing o'er the Plains, Turn'd only to the Grove his Horse's Reins, The Grove I nam'd before; and lighting there, A Woodbind Garland sought to crown his Hair; Then turn'd his Face against the rising Day, And rais'd his Voice to welcome in the May. “For thee, sweet Month, the Groves green Liv'ries wear, “If not the first, the fairest of the Year: “For thee the Graces lead the dancing Hours, “And Nature's ready Pencil paints the Flow'rs: “When thy short Reign is past, the Fev'rish Sun “The sultry Tropick fears, and moves more slowly on. “So may thy tender Blossoms fear no Blite, “Nor Goats with venom'd Teeth thy Tendrils bite, “As thou shalt guide my wand'ring Feet to find “The fragrant Greens I seek, my Brows to bind.” His Vows address'd, within the Grove he stray'd, Till Fate, or Fortune, near the Place convey'd His Steps where secret Palamon was laid. Full little thought of him the gentle Knight, Who flying Death had there conceal'd his Flight, In Brakes and Brambles hid, and shunning Mortal Sight. And less he knew him for his hated Foe, But fear'd him as a Man he did not know. But as it has been said of ancient Years, That Fields are full of Eyes, and Woods have Ears: For this the Wise are ever on their Guard, For Unforeseen, they say, is Unprepar'd. Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone, And less than all suspected Palamon, Who list'ning heard him, while he search'd the Grove, And loudly sung his Roundelay of Love. But on the sudden stopp'd and silent stood, (As Lovers often muse, and change their Mood;) Now high as Heav'n, and then as low as Hell; Now up, now down, as Buckets in a Well: For Venus, like her Day, will change her Cheer, And seldom shall we see a Friday clear. Thus Arcite having sung, with alter'd Hue Sunk on the Ground, and from his Bosom drew A desp'rate Sigh, accusing Heav'n and Fate, And angry Juno's unrelenting Hate. “Curs'd be the Day when first I did appear; “Let it be blotted from the Calendar, “Lest it pollute the Month, and poison all the Year. “Still will the jealous Queen pursue our Race? “Cadmus is dead, the Theban City was: “Yet ceases not her Hate: For all who come “From Cadmus, are involv'd in Cadmus' Doom. “I suffer for my Blood: Unjust Decree! “That punishes another's Crime on me. “In mean Estate I serve my mortal Foe, “The Man who caus'd my Country's Overthrow. “This is not all; for Juno, to my Shame, “Has forc'd me to forsake my former Name; “Arcite I was, Philostratus I am. “That Side of Heaven is all my Enemy: “Mars ruin'd Thebes; his Mother ruin'd me. “Of all the Royal Race remains but one “Beside myself, th' unhappy Palamon, “Whom Theseus holds in Bonds, and will not free; “Without a Crime, except his Kin to me. “Yet these, and all the rest I cou'd endure; “But Love's a Malady without a Cure: “Fierce Love has pierc'd me with his fiery Dart, “He fries within, and hisses at my Heart. “Your Eyes, fair Emily, my Fate pursue; “I suffer for the rest, I die for you. “Of such a Goddess no Time leaves Record, “Who burn'd the Temple where she was ador'd: “And let it burn, I never will complain, “Pleas'd with my Suff'rings, if you knew my Pain.” At this a sickly Qualm his Heart assail'd, His Ears ring inward, and his Senses fail'd. No Word miss'd Palamon of all he spoke, But soon to deadly Pale he chang'd his Look: He trembled ev'ry Limb, and felt a Smart, As if cold Steel had glided through his Heart; Nor longer staid, but starting from his Place, Discover'd stood, and show'd his hostile Face: ‘False Traitor Arcite, Traitor to thy Blood, ‘Bound by thy sacred Oath to seek my Good, ‘Now art thou found forsworn, for Emily; ‘And dar'st attempt her Love, for whom I die. ‘So hast thou cheated Theseus with a Wile, ‘Against thy Vow, returning to beguile ‘Under a borrow'd Name: As false to me, ‘So false thou art to him that set thee free: ‘But rest assur'd, that either thou shalt die, ‘Or else renounce thy Claim in Emily. ‘For though unarm'd I am, and (freed by Chance) ‘Am here without my Sword, or pointed Lance: ‘Hope not, base Man, unquestion'd hence to go, ‘For I am Palamon, thy mortal Foe.’ Arcite, who heard his Tale, and knew the Man, His Sword unsheath'd, and fiercely thus began: “Now by the Gods, who govern Heav'n above, “Wert thou not weak with Hunger, mad with Love, “That Word had been thy last, or in this Grove “This Hand should force thee to renounce thy Love. “The Surety which I gave thee, I defy: “Fool, not to know that Love endures no Tie, “And Jove but laughs at Lovers Perjury. “Know, I will serve the Fair in thy despite; “But since thou art my Kinsman, and a Knight, “Here, have my Faith, to-morrow in this Grove “Our Arms shall plead the Titles of our Love: “And Heav'n so help my Right, as I alone “Will come, and keep the Cause and Quarel both unknown, “With Arms of Proof both for myself and thee; “Choose thou the Best, and leave the Worst to me. “And, that a better Ease thou may'st abide, “Bedding and Cloaths I will this Night provide, “And needful Sustenance, that thou may'st be “A Conquest better won, and worthy me.” His Promise Palamon accepts; but pray'd, To keep it better than the first he made. Thus fair they parted till the Morrow's Dawn, For each had laid his plighted Faith to pawn. Oh Love! Thou sternly dost thy Pow'r maintain, And wilt not bear a Rival in thy Reign, Tyrants and thou all Fellowship disdain. This was in Arcite prov'd, and Palamon, Both in Despair, yet each wou'd love alone. Arcite return'd, and, as in Honor ty'd, His Foe with Bedding, and with Food supply'd; Then, e're the Day, two Suits of Armour sought, Which borne before him on his Steed he brought: Both were of shining Steel, and wrought so pure, As might the Strokes of two such Arms endure. Now, at the Time, and in th' appointed Place, The Challenger, and Challeng'd, Face to Face, Approach; each other from afar they knew, And from afar their Hatred chang'd their Hue. So stands the Thracian Herdsman with his Spear, Full in the Gap, and hopes the hunted Bear, And hears him rustling in the Wood, and sees His Course at Distance by the bending Trees; And thinks, Here comes my mortal Enemy, And either he must fall in Fight, or I: This while he thinks, he lifts aloft his Dart; A gen'rous Chilness seizes ev'ry Part; The Veins pour back the Blood, and fortify the Heart. Thus pale they meet; their Eyes with Fury burn; None greets; for none the Greeting will return: But in dumb Surliness, each arm'd with Care His Foe profest, as Brother of the War: Then both, no Moment lost, at once advance Against each other, arm'd with Sword and Lance: They lash, they foin, they pass, they strive to bore Their Corslets, and the thinnest Parts explore. Thus two long Hours in equal Arms they stood, And wounded, wound; till both were bath'd in Blood; And not a Foot of Ground had either got, As if the World depended on the Spot. Fell Arcite like an angry Tiger far'd, And like a Lion Palamon appear'd: Or as two Boars whom Love to Battle draws, With rising Bristles, and with frothy Jaws, Their adverse Breasts with Tusks oblique they wound; With Grunts and Groans the Forest rings around. So fought the Knights, and fighting must abide, Till Fate an Umpire sends their Diff'rence to decide. The Pow'r that ministers to God's Decrees, And executes on Earth what Heav'n foresees, Call'd Providence, or Chance, or fatal Sway, Comes with resistless Force, and finds or makes her Way. Nor Kings, nor Nations, nor united Pow'r, One Moment can retard th' appointed Hour. And some one Day, some wond'rous Chance appears, Which happen'd not in Centuries of Years: For sure, whate'er we Mortals hate, or love, Or hope, or fear, depends on Pow'rs above; They move our Appetites to Good or Ill, And by Foresight necessitate the Will. In Theseus this appears; whose youthful Joy Was Beasts of Chase in Forests to destroy; This gentle Knight, inspir'd by jolly May, Forsook his easy Couch at early Day, And to the Wood and Wilds pursu'd his Way. Beside him rode Hippolita the Queen, And Emily attir'd in lively Green: With Horns, and Hounds, and all the tuneful Cry, To hunt a Royal Hart within the Covert nigh: And as he follow'd Mars before, so now He serves the Goddess of the Silver Bow. The Way that Theseus took was to the Wood, Where the two Knights in cruel Battle stood: The Lawn on which they fought, th' appointed Place, In which th' uncoupled Hounds began the Chace. Thither forth-right he rode to rouze the Prey, That shaded by the Fern in Harbour lay; And thence dislodg'd, was wont to leave the Wood, For open Fields, and cross the Crystal Flood. Approach'd, and looking underneath the Sun, He saw proud Arcite, and fierce Palamon, In mortal Battle doubling Blow on Blow, Like Light'ning flam'd their Fauchions to and fro, And shot a dreadful Gleam; so strong they struck, There seem'd less Force requir'd to fell an Oak: He gaz'd with Wonder on their equal Might, Look'd eager on, but knew not either Knight: Resolv'd to learn, he spurr'd his fiery Steed With goring Rowels, to provoke his Speed. The Minute ended that began the Race, So soon he was betwixt 'em on the Place: And with his Sword unsheath'd, on pain of Life Commands both Combatants to cease their Strife Then with imperious Tone pursues his Threat: “What are you? Why in Arms together met? “How dares your Pride presume against my Laws, “As in a lifted Field to fight your Cause? “Unask'd the Royal Grant; no Marshal by, “As Knightly Rites require; nor Judge to try?” Then Palamon, with scarce-recover'd Breath, Thus hasty spoke: ‘We both deserve the Death, ‘And both wou'd die; for look the World around, ‘A Pair so wretched is not to be found. ‘Our Life's a Load; encumber'd with the Charge, ‘We long to set th' imprison'd Soul at large. ‘Now as thou art a Sov'reign Judge, decree ‘The rightful Doom of Death to him and me, ‘Let neither find thy Grace; for Grace is Cruelty. ‘Me first, O kill me first; and cure my Woe: ‘Then sheath the Sword of Justice on my Foe, ‘Or kill him first; for when his Name is heard, ‘He foremost will receive his due Reward. ‘Arcite of Thebes is he; thy mortal Foe, ‘On whom thy Grace did Liberty bestow, ‘But first contracted, that if ever found ‘By Day or Night upon th' Athenian Ground, ‘His Head should pay the Forfeit: See return'd ‘The perjur'd Knight, his Oath and Honor scorn'd. ‘For this is he, who with a borrow'd Name ‘And proffer'd Service to thy Palace came, ‘Now call'd Philostratus: Retain'd by thee, ‘A Traitor trusted, and in high Degree, ‘Aspiring to the Bed of beauteous Emily. ‘My Part remains: From Thebes my Birth I own, ‘And call myself th' unhappy Palamon. ‘Think me not like that Man; since no Disgrace ‘Can force me to renounce the Honor of my Race. ‘Know me for what I am: I broke thy Chain, ‘Nor promis'd I thy Pris'ner to remain: ‘The Love of Liberty with Life is giv'n, ‘And Life itself th' inferior Gift of Heav'n. ‘Thus without Crime I fled; but farther know, ‘I with this Arcite am thy mortal Foe: ‘Then give me Death, since I thy Life pursue, ‘For Safeguard of thyself, Death is my Due. ‘More wou'dst thou know? I love bright Emily, ‘And for her Sake and in her Sight will die: ‘But kill my Rival too; for he no less ‘Deserves; and I thy righteous Doom will bless, ‘Assur'd that what I lose, he never shall possess.’ To this reply'd the stern Athenian Prince, And sourly smil'd: “In owning your Offence “You judge your self; and I but keep Record “In place of Law, while you pronounce the Word. “Take your Desert, the Death you have decreed; “I seal your Doom, and ratify the Deed. “By Mars, the Patron of my Arms you die.” He said; dumb Sorrow seiz'd the Standers-by. The Queen above the rest, by Nature good, (The Pattern form'd of perfect Womanhood) For tender Pity wept: When she began, Through the bright Quire th' infectious Virtue ran. All dropp'd their Tears, ev'n the contended Maid: And thus among themselves they softly said: ‘What Eyes can suffer this unworthy Sight! ‘Two Youths of Royal Blood, renown'd in Fight, ‘The Mastership of Heav'n in Face and Mind, ‘And Lovers, far beyond their faithless Kind: ‘See their wide streaming Wounds; they neither came ‘For Pride of Empire, nor Desire of Fame: ‘Kings fight for Kingdoms, Madmen for Applause; ‘But Love for Love alone; that crowns the Lover's Cause.’ This Thought, which ever bribes the beauteous Kind, Such Pity wrought in ev'ry Lady's Mind, They left their Steeds, and prostrate on the Place, From the fierce King, implor'd th' Offenders Grace. He paus'd a while, stood silent in his Mood, (For yet, his Rage was boiling in his Blood) But soon his tender Mind th' Impression felt, (As softest Metals are not slow to melt, And Pity soonest runs in gentle Minds:) Then reasons with himself; and first he finds His Passion cast a Mist before his Sense, And either made, or magnify'd th' Offence. Offence! of what? to whom? Who judg'd the Cause? The Pris'ner freed himself by Nature's Laws: Born free, he sought his Right: The Man he freed Was perjur'd, but his Love excus'd the Deed: Thus pond'ring, he look'd under with his Eyes, And saw the Womens Tears, and heard their Cries; Which mov'd Compassion more: he shook his Head, And softly sighing, to himself he said: “Curse on th' unpard'ning Prince, whom Tears can draw “To no Remorse; who rules by Lions Law; “And deaf to Pray'rs, by no Submission bow'd, “Rends all alike, the Penitent and Proud:” At this, with Look serene, he rais'd his Head. Reason resum'd her Place, and Passion fled: Then thus aloud he spoke: “The Pow'r of Love, “In Earth, and Seas, and Air, and Heav'n above, “Rules, unresisted, with an awful Nod; “By daily Miracles, declar'd a God: “He blinds the Wise, gives Eye-sight to the Blind; “And moulds and stamps anew the Lover's Mind. “Behold that Arcite, and this Palamon, “Freed from my Fetters, and in Safety gone, “What hinder'd either in their native Soil, “At Ease to reap the Harvest of their Toil? “But Love, their Lord, did otherwise ordain, “And brought them in their own Despite again, “To suffer Death deserv'd; for well they know, “'Tis in my Pow'r, and I their deadly Foe: “The Proverb holds, That to be wise and love, “Is hardly granted to the Gods above. “See how the Madmen bleed: Behold the Gains “With which their Master, Love, rewards their Pains: “For sev'n long Years, on Duty ev'ry Day, “Lo their Obedience, and their Monarch's Pay! “Yet, as in Duty bound, they serve him on; “And ask the Fools, they think it wisely done: “Nor Ease, nor Wealth, nor Life itself regard, “For 'tis their Maxim, Love is Love's Reward. “This is not all; the Fair for whom they strove, “Nor knew before, nor could suspect their Love, “Nor thought, when she beheld the Fight from far, “Her Beauty was th' Occasion of the War. “But sure a gen'ral Doom on Man is past, “And all are Fools and Lovers, first or last: “This both by others and myself I know, “For I have serv'd their Sovereign long ago. “Oft have been caught within the winding Train “Of Female Snares, and felt the Lover's Pain, “And learn'd how far the God can Human Hearts constrain. “To this Remembrance, and the Prayers of those “Who for th' offending Warriors interpose, “I give their forfeit Lives; on this Accord, “To do me Homage as their Sov'reign Lord; “And as my Vassals, to their utmost Might, “Assist my Person, and assert my Right.” This, freely sworn, the Knights their Grace obtain'd; Then thus the King his secret Thoughts explain'd: “If Wealth, or Honor, or a Royal Race, “Or each, or all, may win a Lady's Grace, “Then either of you Knights may well deserve “A Princess born; and such is she you serve; “For Emily is Sister to the Crown, “And but too well to both her Beauty known: “But shou'd you combat till you both were dead, “Two Lovers cannot share a single Bed: “As therefore both are equal in Degree, “The Lot of both be left to Destiny. “Now hear th' Award, and happy may it prove “To her, and him who best deserves her Love. “Depart from hence in Peace, and free as Air, “Search the wide World, and where you please repair; “But on the Day when this returning Sun “To the same Point through ev'ry Sign has run, “Then each of you his Hundred Knights shall bring, “In Royal Lists, to fight before the King; “And then the Knight, whom Fate or happy Chance “Shall with his Friends to Victory advance, “And grace his Arms so far in equal Fight, “From out the Bars to force his Opposite, “Or kill, or make him Recreant on the Plain, “The Prize of Valour and of Love shall gain; “The vanquish'd Party shall their Claim release, “And the long Jars conclude in lasting Peace. “The Charge be mine t'adorn the chosen Ground, “The Theatre of War, for Champions so renown'd; “And take the Patron's Place of either Knight, “With Eyes impartial to behold the Fight; “And Heav'n of me so judge, as I shall judge aright; “If both are satisfy'd with this Accord, “Swear by the Laws of Knighthood on my Sword.” Who now but Palamon exults with Joy? And ravish'd Arcite seems to touch the Sky: The whole assembled Troop was pleas'd as well, Extol'd th' Award, and on their Knees they fell To bless the gracious King. The Knights with Leave, Departing from the Place, his last Commands receive, On Emily with equal Ardor look, And from her Eyes their Inspiration took. From thence to Thebes' old Walls pursue their Way, Each to provide his Champions for the Day. It might be deem'd on our Historian's Part, Or too much Negligence, or want of Art, If he forgot the vast Magnificence Of Royal Theseus, and his large Expence. He first inclos'd for Lists a level Ground, The whole Circumference a Mile around: The Form was Circular; and all without A Trench was sunk, to moat the Place about. Within, an Amphitheatre appear'd, Rais'd in Degrees; to sixty Paces rear'd: That when a Man was plac'd in one Degree, Height was allow'd for him above to see. Eastward was built a Gate of Marble white; The like adorn'd the Western opposite. A nobler Object than this Fabrick was, Rome never saw; nor of so vast a Space. For, rich with Spoils of many a conquer'd Land, All Arts and Artists Theseus could command; Who sold for Hire, or wrought for better Fame; The Master-Painters and the Carvers came. So rose within the Compass of a Year An Age's Work, a glorious Theatre. Then o'er its Eastern Gate was rais'd above A Temple, sacred to the Queen of Love; An Altar stood below: On either Hand A Priest with Roses crown'd, who held a Myrtle Wand. The Dome of Mars was on the Gate oppos'd, And on the North a Turret was inclos'd, Within the Wall, of Alabaster white, And Crimson Coral, for the Queen of Night, Who takes in Sylvan Sports her chaste Delight. Within these Oratories might you see Rich Carvings, Pourtraitures, and Imag'ry: Where ev'ry Figure to the Life express'd The Godhead's Pow'r to whom it was address'd. In Venus' Temple, on the Sides were seen The broken Slumbers of enamour'd Men: Pray'rs that ev'n spoke, and Pity seem'd to call, And issuing Sighs that smok'd along the Wall. Complaints, and hot Desires, the Lover's Hell, And scalding Tears, that wore a Channel where they fell: And all around were Nuptial Bonds, the Ties Of Love's Assurance, and a Train of Lies, That, made in Lust, conclude in Perjuries. Beauty, and Youth, and Wealth, and Luxury, And spritely Hope, and short-enduring Joy; And Sorceries to raise th' Infernal Pow'rs, And Sigils fram'd in Planetary Hours: Expence, and After-thought, and idle Care, And Doubts of motly Hue, and dark Despair: Suspicions, and fantastical Surmise, And Jealousy suffus'd, with Jaundice in her Eyes; Discolouring all she view'd, in Tawny dress'd; Down-look'd, and with a Cuckow on her Fist. Oppos'd to her, on t'other Side advance The costly Feast, the Carol, and the Dance, Minstrels and Musick, Poetry and Play, And Balls by Night, and Tournaments by Day. All these were painted on the Wall, and more; With Acts and Monuments of Times before: And others added by Prophetick Doom, And Lovers yet unborn, and Loves to come: For there, th' Idalian Mount, and Citheron, The Court of Venus, was in Colours drawn: Before the Palace-Gate, in careless Dress, And loose Array, sat Portress Idleness: There, by the Fount, Narcissus pin'd alone; There Sampson was; with wiser Solomon, And all the mighty Names by Love undone. Medea's Charms were there, Circean Feasts, With Bowls that turn'd enamour'd Youths to Beasts. Here might be seen, that Beauty, Wealth, and Wit, And Prowess, to the Pow'r of Love submit: The spreading Snare for all Mankind is laid; And Lovers all betray, and are betray'd. The Goddess' self, some noble Hand had wrought; Smiling she seem'd, and full of pleasing Thought: From Ocean as she first began to rise, And smooth'd the ruffl'd Seas, and clear'd the Skies; She trod the Brine all bare below the Breast, And the green Waves but ill conceal'd the rest; A Lute she held; and on her Head was seen A Wreath of Roses red, and Myrtles green; Her Turtles fann'd the buxom Air above; And by his Mother, stood an Infant-Love, With Wings unfledg'd; his Eyes were banded o'er; His Hands a Bow, his Back a Quiver bore, Supply'd with Arrows bright and keen, a deadly Store. But in the Dome of mighty Mars the Red, With diff'rent Figures all the Sides were spread: This Temple, less in Form, with equal Grace Was imitative of the first in Thrace: For that cold Region was the lov'd Abode, And Sov'reign Mansion of the Warrior-God. The Landscape was a Forest wide and bare; Where neither Beast, nor Human-kind repair; The Fowl, that scent afar, the Borders fly, And shun the bitter Blast, and wheel about the Sky. A Cake of Scurf lies baking on the Ground, And prickly Stubs, instead of Trees are found; Or Woods with Knots and Knares deform'd and old; Headless the most, and hideous to behold: A ratling Tempest through the Branches went, That stripp'd 'em bare, and one sole Way they bent. Heav'n froze above, severe, the Clouds congeal, And thro' the Crystal Vault appear'd the standing Hail. Such was the Face without, a Mountain stood Threat'ning from high, and overlook'd the Wood: Beneath the low'ring Brow, and on a Bent, The Temple stood of Mars Armipotent; The Frame of burnish'd Steel, that cast a Glare From far, and seem'd to thaw the freezing Air. A strait, long Entry, to the Temple led, Blind with high Walls; and Horror over Head: Thence issued such a Blast and hollow Rore, As threaten'd from the Hinge to heave the Door; In, through that Door, a Northern Light there shone; 'Twas all it had, for Windows there were none. The Gate was Adamant; Eternal Frame! Which hew'd by Mars himself, from Indian Quarries came, The Labour of a God; and all along Tough Iron Plates were clench'd to make it strong. A Tun about was ev'ry Pillar there; A polish'd Mirror shone not half so clear. There saw I how the secret Felon wrought, And Treason lab'ring in the Traitor's Thought; And Midwife Time the ripen'd Plot to Murder brought. There, the Red Anger dar'd the Pallid Fear; Next stood Hippocrisy, with holy Leer: Soft, smiling, and demurely looking down, But hid the Dagger underneath the Gown: Th' assassinating Wife, the Houshold Fiend; And far the blackest there, the Traitor-Friend. On t'other Side, there stood Destruction bare; Unpunish'd Rapine, and a Waste of War. Contest, with sharpen'd Knives, in Cloisters drawn, And all with Blood bespread the holy Lawn. Loud Menaces were heard, and foul Disgrace, And bawling Infamy, in Language base; Till Sense was lost in Sound, and Silence fled the Place. The Slayer of himself yet saw I there, The Gore congeal'd was clotter'd in his Hair: With Eyes half clos'd, and gaping Mouth he lay, And grim, as when he breath'd his Sullen Soul away. In midst of all the Dome, Misfortune sat, And gloomy Discontent, and fell Debate. And Madness laughing in his ireful Mood; And arm'd Complaint on Theft; and Cries of Blood. There was the murder'd Corps, in Covert laid, And Violent Death in thousand Shapes display'd: The City to the Soldier's Rage resign'd: Successless Wars, and Poverty behind: Ships burnt in Fight, or forc'd on Rocky Shores, And the rash Hunter strangled by the Boars: The new-born Babe by Nurses overlaid; And the Cook caught within the Raging Fire he made. All Ills of Mars his Nature, Flame and Steel; The gasping Charioteer, beneath the Wheel Of his own Car; the ruin'd House that falls And intercepts her Lord betwixt the Walls: The whole Division that to Mars pertains, All Trades of Death, that deal in Steel for Gains, Were there: The Butcher, Armourer, and Smith, Who forges sharpen'd Fauchions, or the Scythe. The scarlet Conquest on a Tow'r was plac'd, With Shouts, and Soldiers Acclamations grac'd: A pointed Sword hung threat'ning o'er his Head, Sustain'd but by a slender Twine of Thread. There saw I Mars his Ides, the Capitol, The Seer in vain foretelling Cæsar's Fall, The last Triumvirs, and the Wars they move, And Antony, who lost the World for Love. These and a thousand more, the Fane adorn; Their Fates were painted e're the Men were born, All copy'd from the Heav'ns and ruling Force Of the red Star, in his revolving Course. The Form of Mars high on a Chariot stood, All sheath'd in Arms, and gruffly look'd the God: Two Geomantick Figures were display'd Above his Head, a Warrior and a Maid, Rubeus and Puella. One when direct, and one when Retrograde. Tir'd with Deformities of Death, I haste To the third Temple of Diana chaste; A Sylvan Scene with various Greens was drawn, Shades on the Sides, and on the midst a Lawn: The Silver Cynthia, with her Nymphs around, Pursued the flying Deer, the Woods with Horns resound: Calistho there stood manifest of Shame, And turn'd a Bear, the Northern Star became: Her Son was next, and by peculiar Grace In the cold Circle held the second Place: The Stag Acteon in the Stream had spy'd The naked Huntress, and, for seeing, dy'd: His Hounds, unknowing of his Change, pursue The Chace, and their mistaken Master slew. Peneian Daphne too was there to see, Apollo's Love before, and now his Tree: Th' adjoining Fane th' assembled Greeks express'd, And hunting of the Caledonian Beast. Oenides' Valour, and his envy'd Prize; The fatal Pow'r of Atalanta's Eyes; Diana's Vengeance on the Victor shown, The Murdress Mother, and consuming Son. The Volcian Queen extended on the Plain; The Treason punish'd, and the Traitor slain. The rest were various Huntings, well design'd, And Savage Beasts destroy'd, of every Kind. The graceful Goddess was array'd in Green; About her Feet were little Beagles seen, That watch'd with upward Eyes the Motions of their Queen. Her Legs were Buskin'd, and the Left before, In act to shoot, a Silver Bow she bore, And at her Back a painted Quiver wore. She trod a wexing Moon, that soon wou'd wane, And drinking borrow'd Light, be fill'd again: With down-cast Eyes, as seeming to survey The dark Dominions, her alternate Sway. Before her stood a Woman in her Throes, And call'd Lucina's Aid, her Burden to disclose. All these the Painter drew with such Command, That Nature snatch'd the Pencil from his Hand, Asham'd and angry that his Art cou'd feign And mend the Tortures of a Mother's Pain. Theseus beheld the Fanes of ev'ry God, And thought his mighty Cost was well bestow'd. So Princes now their Poets should regard; But few can write, and fewer can reward. The Theatre thus rais'd, the Lists enclos'd, And all with vast Magnificence dispos'd, We leave the Monarch pleas'd, and haste to bring The Knights to Combate: and their Arms to sing. The Day approach'd, when Fortune shou'd decide Th' important Enterprize, and give the Bride; For now, the Rivals round the World had sought, And each his Number, well-appointed, brought. The Nations, far and near, contend in Choice, And send the Flow'r of War by publick Voice; That after, or before, were never known Such Chiefs; as each an Army seem'd alone: Besides the Champions; all of high Degree, Who Knight-hood lov'd and Deeds of Chivalry, Throng'd to the Lists, and envy'd to behold The Names of others, not their own, enroll'd. Nor seems it strange; for ev'ry Noble Knight, Who loves the Fair, and is endu'd with Might, In such a Quarrel wou'd be proud to fight. There breathes not scarce a Man on British Ground (An Isle for Love and Arms of old renown'd) But would have sold his Life to purchase Fame, To Palamon or Arcite sent his Name: And had the Land selected of the best, Half had come hence, and let the World provide the rest. A hundred Knights with Palamon there came, Approv'd in Fight, and Men of mighty Name: Their Arms were sev'ral, as their Nations were; But furnish'd all alike with Sword and Spear. Some wore Coat-armour, imitating Scale; And next their Skins were stubborn Shirts of Mail. Some wore a Breastplate and a light Juppon, Their Horses cloath'd with rich Caparison: Some for Defence would leathern Bucklers use, Of folded Hides; and others Shields of Pruce. One hung a Pole-axe at his Saddle-bow, And one a heavy Mace, to shun the Foe: One for his Legs and Knees provided well, With Jambeux arm'd, and double Plates of Steel: This on his Helmet wore a Lady's Glove, And that a Sleeve embroider'd by his Love. With Palamon, above the rest in Place, Lycurgus came, the surly King of Thrace; Black was his Beard, and manly was his Face: The Balls of his broad Eyes roll'd in his Head, And glar'd betwixt a Yellow and a Red: He look'd a Lion with a gloomy Stare, And o'er his Eye-brows hung his matted Hair: Big-bon'd, and large of Limbs, with Sinews strong, Broad-shoulder'd, and his Arms were round and long. Four Milk-white Bulls (the Thracian Use of old) Were yok'd to draw his Car of burnish'd Gold. Upright he stood, and bore aloft his Shield, Conspicuous from afar, and over-look'd the Field. His Surcoat was a Bear-skin on his Back; His Hair hung long behind, and glossy Raven-black. His ample Forehead bore a Coronet, With sparkling Diamonds, and with Rubies set: Ten Brace, and more, of Greyhounds, snowy fair, And tall as Stags, ran loose, and cours'd around his Chair, A Match for Pards in flight; in grappling, for the Bear. With golden Muzzles all their Mouths were bound, And Collars of the same their Necks surround. Thus thro' the Fields Lycurgus took his Way; His hundred Knights attend in Pomp and proud Array. To match this Monarch, with strong Arcite came Emetrius King of Inde, a mighty Name, On a Bay Courser, goodly to behold, The Trappings of his Horse emboss'd with barb'rous Gold, Not Mars bestrode a Steed with greater Grace; His Surcoat o'er his Arms was Cloth of Thrace, Adorn'd with Pearls, all Orient, round, and great; His Saddle was of Gold with Em'ralds set. His Shoulders large a Mantle did attire, With Rubies thick, and sparkling as the Fire: His Amber-colour'd Locks in Ringlets run, With graceful Negligence, and shone against the Sun. His Nose was Aquiline, his Eyes were blue, Ruddy his Lips, and fresh and fair his Hue: Some sprinkled Freckles on his Face were seen, Whose Dusk set off the Whiteness of the Skin: His awful Presence did the Crowd surprize, Nor durst the rash Spectator meet his Eyes, Eyes that confess'd him born for Kingly Sway, So fierce, they flash'd intolerable Day. His Age in Nature's youthful Prime appear'd, And just began to bloom his yellow Beard. Whene'er he spoke, his Voice was heard around, Loud as a Trumpet, with a Silver Sound. A Laurel wreath'd his Temples, fresh, and green; And Myrtle-sprigs, the Marks of Love, were mix'd between. Upon his Fist he bore, for his Delight, An Eagle well reclaim'd, and Lily-white. His hundred Knights attend him to the War, All arm'd for Battle; save their Heads were bare. Words and Devices blaz'd on ev'ry Shield, And pleasing was the Terror of the Field. For Kings, and Dukes, and Barons you might see, Like sparkling Stars, though diff'rent in Degree, All for th' Increase of Arms, and Love of Chivalry. Before the King, tame Leopards led the Way, And Troops of Lions innocently play. So Bacchus through the conquer'd Indies rode, And Beasts in Gambols frisk'd before their honest God. In this Array the War of either Side Through Athens pass'd with Military Pride. At Prime, they enter'd on the Sunday Morn; Rich Tap'stry spread the Streets, and Flow'rs the Pots adorn. The Town was all a Jubilee of Feasts; So Theseus will'd, in Honor of his Guests; Himself with open Arms the King embrac'd, Then all the rest in their Degrees were grac'd. No Harbinger was needful for the Night, For ev'ry House was proud to lodge a Knight. I pass the Royal Treat, nor must relate The Gifts bestow'd, nor how the Champions sate; Who first, who last, or how the Knights address'd Their Vows, or who was fairest at the Feast; Whose Voice, whose graceful Dance did most surprize, Soft am'rous Sighs, and silent Love of Eyes. The Rivals call my Muse another way, To sing their Vigils for th' ensuing Day. 'Twas ebbing Darkness, past the Noon of Night; And Phosphor, on the Confines of the Light, Promis'd the Sun, e're Day began to spring; The tuneful Lark already stretch'd her Wing, And flick'ring on her Nest, made short Essays to sing: When wakeful Palamon, preventing Day, Took, to the Royal Lists, his early way. To Venus, at her Fane, in her own House, to pray. There, falling on his Knees before her Shrine, He thus implor'd with Pray'rs her Pow'r Divine. ‘Creator Venus, Genial Pow'r of Love, ‘The Bliss of Men below, and Gods above, ‘Beneath the sliding Sun thou runn'st thy Race, ‘Dost fairest shine, and best become thy Place. ‘For thee the Winds their Eastern Blasts forbear, ‘Thy Month reveals the Spring, and opens all the Year. ‘Thee, Goddess, thee the Storms of Winter fly, ‘Earth smiles with Flow'rs renewing; laughs the Sky, ‘And Birds to Lays of Love their tuneful Notes apply. ‘For thee the Lion loaths the Taste of Blood, ‘And roaring hunts his Female through the Wood: ‘For thee the Bulls rebellow through the Groves, ‘And tempt the Stream, and snuff their absent Loves. ‘'Tis thine, whate'er is pleasant, good, or fair: ‘All Nature is thy Providence, Life thy Care; ‘Thou mad'st the World, and dost the World repair. ‘Thou Gladder of the Mount of Cytheron, ‘Increase of Jove, Companion of the Sun; ‘If e'er Adonis touch'd thy tender Heart, ‘Have Pity, Goddess, for thou know'st the Smart. ‘Alas! I have not Words to tell my Grief; ‘To vent my Sorrow wou'd be some Relief: ‘Light Suff'rings give us Leisure to complain; We groan, but cannot speak, in greater Pain. ‘O Goddess, tell thyself what I wou'd say, ‘Thou know'st it, and I feel too much to pray. ‘So grant my Suit, as I enforce my Might, ‘In Love to be thy Champion and thy Knight; ‘A Servant to thy Sex, a Slave to Thee, ‘A Foe profest to barren Chastity. ‘Nor ask I Fame or Honor of the Field, ‘Nor chuse I more to vanquish than to yield: ‘In my Divine Emilia make me blest, ‘Let Fate, or partial Chance, dispose the rest: ‘Find thou the Manner, and the Means prepare; ‘Possession, more than Conquest, is my Care. ‘Mars is the Warrior's God; in him it lies, ‘On whom he favours to confer the Prize; ‘With smiling Aspect you serenely move ‘In your fifth Orb, and rule the Realm of Love. ‘The Fates but only spin the coarser Clue, ‘The finest of the Wool is left for you. ‘Spare me but one small Portion of the Twine, ‘And let the Sisters cut below your Line: ‘The rest among the Rubbish may they sweep, ‘Or add it to the Yarn of some old Miser's Heap. ‘But if you this ambitious Pray'r deny, ‘(A Wish, I grant, beyond Mortality) ‘Then let me sink beneath proud Arcite's Arms, ‘And I once dead, let him possess her Charms.’ Thus ended he; then, with Observance due, The sacred Incense on her Altar threw: The curling Smoke mounts heavy from the Fires; At length it catches Flame, and in a Blaze expires; At once the gracious Goddess gave the Sign, Her Statue shook, and trembled all the Shrine: Pleas'd Palamon the tardy Omen took: For, since the Flames pursu'd the trailing Smoke, He knew his Boon was granted; but the Day To distance driv'n, and Joy adjourn'd with long Delay. Now Morn with Rosy Light had streak'd the Sky, Up rose the Sun, and up rose Emily; Address'd her early Steps to Cynthia's Fane, In State attended by her Maiden Train, Who bore the Vests that Holy Rites require, Incense, and od'rous Gums, and cover'd Fire, The plenteous Horns with pleasant Mead they crown, Nor wanted aught besides in Honor of the Moon. Now while the Temple smok'd with hallow'd Steam, They wash the Virgin in a living Stream; The secret Ceremonies I conceal: Uncouth; perhaps unlawful to reveal: But such they were as Pagan Use requir'd, Perform'd by Women when the Men retir'd, Whose Eyes profane, their chaste mysterious Rites Might turn to Scandal, or obscene Delights. Well-meaners think no harm; but for the rest, Things sacred they pervert, and Silence is the best. Her shining Hair, uncomb'd, was loosely spread, A Crown of Mastless Oak adorn'd her Head: When to the Shrine approach'd, the spotless Maid Had kindling Fires on either Altar laid: (The Rites were such as were observ'd of old, By Statius in his Theban Story told.) Then kneeling, with her Hands across her Breast, Thus lowly she preferr'd her chaste Request. ‘O Goddess, Haunter of the Woodland Green, ‘To whom both Heav'n and Earth and Seas are seen; ‘Queen of the nether Skies, where half the Year ‘Thy Silver Beams descend, and light the gloomy Sphere; ‘Goddess of Maids, and conscious of our Hearts, ‘So keep me from the Vengance of thy Darts, ‘Which Niobe's devoted Issue felt, ‘When hissing thro' the Skies the feather'd Deaths were dealt: ‘As I desire to live a Virgin-Life, ‘Nor know the Name of Mother, or of Wife. ‘Thy Votress from my tender Years I am, ‘And love, like thee, the Woods and Sylvan Game. ‘Like Death, thou know'st I loath the Nuptial-State, ‘And Man, the Tyrant of our Sex, I hate, ‘A lowly Servant, but a lofty Mate. ‘Where Love is Duty, on the Female Side: ‘On theirs meer sensual Gust, and sought with surly Pride. ‘Now by thy triple Shape, as thou art seen ‘In Heav'n, Earth, Hell, and ev'ry where a Queen, ‘Grant this my first Desire; let Discord cease, ‘And make betwixt the Rivals lasting Peace: ‘Quench their hot Fire, or far from me remove ‘The Flame, and turn it on some other Love. ‘Or if my frowning Stars have so decreed, ‘That one may be rejected, one succeed, ‘Make him my Lord, within whose faithful Breast ‘Is fixt my Image, and who loves me best. ‘But, oh! ev'n that avert! I chuse it not, ‘But take it as the least unhappy Lot. ‘A Maid I am, and of thy Virgin Train; ‘Oh, let me still that spotless Name retain! ‘Frequent the Forests, thy chaste Will obey, ‘And only make the Beasts of Chaste my Prey!’ The Flames ascend on either Altar clear, While thus the blameless Maid address'd her Pray'r. When lo! the burning Fire, that shone so bright, Flew off, all sudden, with extinguish'd Light, And left one Altar dark, a little space; Which turn'd self-kindled, and renew'd the Blaze: The other Victor-Flame a Moment stood, Then fell, and lifeless left th' extinguish'd Wood: For ever lost, th' irrevocable Light Forsook the black'ning Coals, and sunk to Night: At either End it whistled as it flew, And as the Brands were green, so dropp'd the Dew; Infected as it fell with Sweat of Sanguine Hue. The Maid from that ill Omen turn'd her Eyes, And with loud Shrieks and Clamours rent the Skies, Nor knew what signify'd the boding Sign, But found the Pow'rs displeas'd, and fear'd the Wrath Divine. Then shook the Sacred Shrine, and sudden Light Sprung through the vaulted Roof, and made the Temple bright. The Pow'r, behold! the Pow'r in Glory shone, By her bent Bow, and her keen Arrows known; The rest, a Huntress issuing from the Wood, Reclining on her Cornel Spear she stood. Then gracious thus began: “Dismiss thy Fear, “And Heav'n's unchang'd Decrees attentive hear: “More pow'rful Gods have torn thee from my Side, “Unwilling to resign, and doom'd a Bride: “The two contending Knights are weigh'd above; “One Mars protects, and one the Queen of Love: “But which the Man, is in the Thund'rer's Breast, “This he pronounc'd, 'tis he who loves thee best. “The Fire that once extinct, reviv'd again, “Foreshows the Love allotted to remain. “Farewel, she said, and vanish'd from the Place;” The Sheaf of Arrows shook and rattled in the Case. Aghast at this, the Royal Virgin stood, Disclaim'd, and now no more a Sister of the Wood: But to the parting Goddess thus she pray'd; ‘Propitious still, be present to my Aid, ‘Nor quite abandon your once favour'd Maid.’ Then sighing she return'd; but smil'd betwixt, With Hopes and Fears, and Joy with Sorrow mixt. The next returning Planetary Hour Of Mars, who shar'd the Heptarchy of Pow'r, His Steps bold Arcite to the Temple bent, T'adore with Pagan Rites the Pow'r Armipotent: Then prostrate, low before his Altar lay, And rais'd his manly Voice, and thus began to pray: “Strong God of Arms, whose Iron Scepter sways “The freezing North, and Hyperborean Seas, “And Scythian Colds, and Thracia's Wintry Coast, “Where stand thy Steeds, and thou art honour'd most: “There most; but ev'ry where thy Pow'r is known, “The Fortune of the Fight is all thy own: “Terror is thine, and wild Amazement flung “From out thy Chariot, withers ev'n the Strong: “And Disarray and shameful Rout ensue, “And Force is added to the fainting Crew. “Acknowledg'd as thou art, accept my Pray'r, “If aught I have atchiev'd deserve thy Care: “I to my utmost Pow'r with Sword and Shield “If dar'd the Death, unknowing how to yield, “And falling in my Rank, still kept the Field: “Then let my Arms prevail, by thee sustain'd, “That Emily by Conquest may be gain'd. “Have pity on my Pains; nor those unknown “To Mars, which when a Lover, were his own. “Venus, the Publick Care of all above, “Thy stubborn Heart has soften'd into Love: “Now by her Blandishments and powerful Charms “When yielded, she lay curling in thy Arms, “Ev'n by thy Shame, if Shame it may be call'd, “When Vulcan had thee in his Net inthrall'd; “O envy'd Ignominy! sweet Disgrace! “When ev'ry God that saw thee, wish'd thy Place! “By those dear Pleasures, aid my Arms in Fight, “And make me conquer in my Patron's Right: “For I am young, a Novice in the Trade, “The Fool of Love, unpractis'd to persuade; “And want the soothing Arts that catch the Fair, “But caught myself, lie struggling in the Snare: “And she I love, or laughs at all my Pain, “Or knows her Worth too well, and pays me with Disdain. “For sure I am, unless I win in Arms, “To stand excluded from Emilia's Charms: “Nor can my Strength avail, unless by thee “Endu'd with Force, I gain the Victory: “Then for the Fire which warm'd thy gen'rous Heart, “Pity thy Subject's Pains, and equal Smart. “So be the Morrow's Sweat and Labour mine, “The Palm and Honor of the Conquest thine: “Then shall the War, and stern Debate, and Strife “Immortal, be the Bus'ness of my Life; “And in thy Fane, the Dusty Spoils among, “High on the burnish'd Roof my Banner shall be hung “Rank'd with my Champions Bucklers, and below “With Arms revers'd, th' Atchievements of my Foe: “And while these Limbs the Vital Spirit feeds, “While Day to Night, and Night to Day succeeds, “Thy smoaking Altar shall be fat with Food “Of Incense, and the grateful Steam of Blood; “Burnt-Off'rings Morn and Ev'ning shall be thine; “And Fires eternal in thy Temple shine. “The Bush of yellow Beard, this Length of Hair, “Which from my Birth inviolate I bear, “Guiltless of Steel, and from the Razor free, “Shall fall a plenteous Crop, reserv'd for thee. “So may my Arms with Victory be blest, “I ask no more; let Fate dispose the rest.” The Champion ceas'd; there follow'd in the Close A hollow Groan, a murm'ring Wind arose, The Rings of Ir'n, that on the Doors were hung, Sent out a jarring Sound, and harshly rung: The bolted Gates flew open at the Blast, The Storm rush'd in, and Arcite stood aghast: The Flames were blown aside, yet shone they bright, Fann'd by the Wind, and gave a ruffled Light. Then from the ground a Scent began to rise, Sweet-smelling, as accepted Sacrifice: This Omen pleas'd, and as the Flames aspire, With od'rous Incense Arcite heaps the Fire: Nor wanted Hymns to Mars, or Heathen Charms: At length the nodding Statue clash'd his Arms: And with a sullen Sound and feeble Cry, Half sunk, and half pronounc'd the Word of Victory; For this, with Soul devout, he thank'd the God, And of Success secure, return'd to his Abode. These Vows thus granted, rais'd a Strife above, Betwixt the God of War and Queen of Love. She granting first, had Right of Time to plead; But he had granted too, nor would recede. Jove was for Venus; but he fear'd his Wife, And seem'd unwilling to decide the Strife; Till Saturn from his Leaden Throne arose, And found a Way the Diff'rence to compose: Though sparing of his Grace, to Mischief bent, He seldom does a Good with good Intent. Wayward, but wise; by long Experience taught, To please both Parties, for ill Ends, he sought: For this Advantage Age from Youth has won, As not to be out-ridden, though out-run. By Fortune he was now to Venus Trin'd, And with stern Mars in Capricorn was join'd: Of him disposing in his own Abode, He sooth'd the Goddess, while he gull'd the God: ‘Cease, Daughter, to complain; and stint the Strife; ‘Thy Palamon shall have his promis'd Wife: ‘And Mars, the Lord of Conquest, in the Fight ‘With Palm and Laurel shall adorn his Knight. ‘Wide is my Course, nor turn I to my Place, ‘Till Length of Time, and move with tardy Pace. ‘Man feels me, when I press th' Etherial Plains, ‘My Hand is heavy, and the Wound remains. ‘Mine is the Shipwreck, in a Watry Sign; ‘And in an Earthy, the dark Dungeon mine. ‘Cold shiv'ring Agues, melancholy Care, ‘And bitter blasting Winds, and poison'd Air, ‘Are mine, and wilful Death, resulting from Despair. ‘The throtling Quinsey 'tis my Star appoints, ‘And Rheumatisms I send to rack the Joints: ‘When Churls rebel against their Native Prince, ‘I arm their Hands, and furnish the Pretence; ‘And housing in the Lion's hateful Sign, ‘Bought Senates, and deserting Troops are mine. ‘Mine is the privy Pois'ning, I command ‘Unkindly Seasons, and ungrateful Land. ‘By me Kings Palaces are push'd to Ground, ‘And Miners, crush'd beneath their Mines are found. ‘'Twas I slew Sampson, when the Pillar'd Hall ‘Fell down, and crush'd the Many with the Fall. ‘My Looking is the Sire of Pestilence, ‘That sweeps at once the People and the Prince. ‘Now weep no more, but trust my Grandsire's Art; ‘Mars shall be pleas'd, and thou perform thy Part. ‘'Tis ill, though diff'rent your Complexions are, ‘The Family of Heav'n for Men should War.’ Th' Expedient pleas'd, where neither lost his Right: Mars had the Day, and Venus had the Night. The Management they left to Chronos' Care; Now turn we to th' Effect, and sing the War. In Athens, all was Pleasure, Mirth and Play, All proper to the Spring, and sprightly May: Which ev'ry Soul inspir'd with such Delight, 'Twas Justing all the Day, and Love at Night. Heav'n smil'd, and gladded was the Heart of Man; And Venus had the World, as when it first began. At length in Sleep their Bodies they compose, And dreamt the future Fight, and early rose. Now scarce the dawning Day began to spring, As at a Signal giv'n, the Streets with Clamours ring: At once the Crowd arose; confus'd and high, Ev'n from the Heav'n was heard a shouting Cry; For Mars was early up, and rous'd the Sky. The Gods came downward to behold the Wars, Sharp'ning their Sights, and leaning from their Stars; The Neighing of the gen'rous Horse was heard, For Battle by the busy Groom prepar'd: Rustling of Harness, rattling of the Shield, Clatt'ring of Armour, furbish'd for the Field. Crowds to the Castle mounted up the Street, Batt'ring the Pavement with their Coursers Feet: The greedy Sight might there devour the Gold Of glitt'ring Arms, too dazzling to behold; And polish'd Steel, that cast the View aside, And crested Morions, with their Plumy Pride. Knights, with a long Retinue of their Squires, In gaudy Liv'ries march, and quaint Attires. One lac'd the Helm, another held the Lance: A third the shining Buckler did advance. The Courser paw'd the Ground with restless Feet, And snorting foam'd, and champ'd the Golden Bit. The Smiths and Armourers on Palfreys ride, Files in their Hands, and Hammers at their Side, And Nails for loosen'd Spears, and Thongs for Shields provide. The Yeomen guard the Streets, in seemly Bands; And Clowns come crowding on, with Cudgels in their Hands. The Trumpets, next the Gate, in order plac'd, Attend the Sign to sound the Martial Blast: The Palace-yard is fill'd with floating Tides, And the last Comers bear the former to the Sides. The Throng is in the midst: The common Crew Shut out, the Hall admits the better Few; In Knots they stand, or in a Rank they walk, Serious in Aspect, earnest in their Talk: Factious, and fav'ring this or t'other Side, As their strong Fancies, and weak Reason guide: Their Wagers back their Wishes: Numbers hold With the fair freckled King, and Beard of Gold: So vig'rous are his Eyes, such Rays they cast, So prominent his Eagle's Beak is plac'd. But most their Looks on the black Monarch bend, His Rising Muscles, and his Brawn commend; His double-biting Ax, and beamy Spear, Each asking a Gigantick Force to rear. All spoke as partial Favour mov'd the Mind; And safe themselves, at others Cost divin'd. Wak'd by the Cries, th' Athenian Chief arose, The Knightly Forms of Combate to dispose; And passing thro' th' obsequious Guards, he sate Conspicuous on a Throne, sublime in State; There, for the two contending Knights he sent; Arm'd Cap-a-pee, with Rev'rence low they bent; He smil'd on both, and with superior Look Alike their offer'd Adoration took. The People press on ev'ry Side to see Their awful Prince, and hear his high Decree. Then signing to their Heralds with his Hand, They gave his Orders from their lofty Stand. Silence is thrice injoin'd; then thus aloud The King at Arms bespeaks the Knights and list'ning Crowd. ‘Our Sovereign Lord has ponder'd in his Mind ‘The Means to spare the Blood of gentle Kind; ‘And of his Grace, and in-born Clemency, ‘He modifies his first severe Decree; ‘The keener Edge of Battle to rebate, ‘The Troops of Honor fighting, not for Hate. ‘He wills, not Death should terminate their Strife; ‘And Wounds, if Wounds ensue, be short of Life. ‘But issues, e're the Fight, his dread Command, ‘That Slings afar, and Poniards Hand to Hand, ‘Be banish'd from the Field; that none shall dare ‘With short'ned Sword to stab in closer War; ‘But in fair Combate fight with manly Strength, ‘Nor push with biting Point, but strike at Length. ‘The Turney is allow'd but one Career, ‘Of the tough Ash, with the sharp-grinded Spear. ‘But Knights unhors'd may rise from off the Plain, ‘And fight on Foot, their Honor to regain. ‘Nor, if at Mischief taken, on the Ground ‘Be slain, but Pris'ners to the Pillar bound, ‘At either Barrier plac'd; nor, Captives made, ‘Be freed, or arm'd anew the Fight invade. ‘The Chief of either Side, bereft of Life, ‘Or yielded to his Foe, concludes the Strife. ‘Thus dooms the Lord: Now valiant Knights and young, ‘Fight each his Fill with Swords and Maces long.’ The Herald ends: The vaulted Firmament With loud Acclaims, and vast Applause is rent: “Heav'n guard a Prince so gracious and so good, “So just, and yet so provident of Blood!” This was the gen'ral Cry. The Trumpets sound, And Warlike Symphony is heard around. The marching Troops thro' Athens take their Way, The great Earl-Mashal orders their Array. The Fair from high the passing Pomp behold; A Rain of Flow'rs is from the Windows roll'd. The Casements are with golden Tissue spread, And Horses Hoofs, for Earth, on Silken Tap'stry tread. The King goes midmost, and the Rivals ride In equal Rank, and close his either Side. Next after these, there rode the Royal Wife, With Emily, the Cause and the Reward of Strife. The following Cavalcade, by Three and Three, Proceed by Titles marshal'd in Degree. Thus thro' the Southern Gate they take their Way, And at the Lists arriv'd e're Prime of Day. There, parting from the King, the Chiefs divide, And wheeling East and West, before their Many ride, Th' Athenian Monarch mounts his Throne on high, And after him the Queen and Emily: Next these, the Kindred of the Crown are grac'd With nearer Seats, and Lords by Ladies plac'd. Scarce were they seated, when with Clamours loud In rush'd at once a rude promiscuous Crowd: The Guards, and then each other overbear, And in a Moment throng the spacious Theatre. Now chang'd the jarring Noise to Whispers low, As Winds forsaking Seas more softly blow; When at the Western Gate, on which the Car Is plac'd aloft, that bears the God of War: Proud Arcite entring arm'd before his Train, Stops at the Barrier, and divides the Plain. Red was his Banner, and display'd abroad The bloody Colours of his Patron God. At that self Moment enters Palamon The Gate of Venus, and the rising Sun; Wav'd by the wanton Winds, his Banner flies, All Maiden White, and shares the Peoples Eyes. From East to West, look all the World around, Two Troops so match'd were never to be found. Such Bodies built for Strength, of equal Age, In Stature siz'd; so proud an Equipage: The nicest Eye could no Distinction make, Where lay th' Advantage, or what Side to take. Thus rang'd, the Herald for the last proclaims A Silence, while they answer'd to their Names: For so the King decreed, to shun with Care The Fraud of Musters false, the common Bane of War. The Tale was just, and then the Gates were clos'd; And Chief to Chief, and Troop to Troop oppos'd. The Heralds last retir'd, and loudly cry'd, “The Fortune of the Field be fairly try'd.” At this, the Challenger with fierce Defy His Trumpet sounds; the Challeng'd makes Reply, With Clangor rings the Field, resounds the vaulted Sky. Their Vizors clos'd, their Lances in the Rest, Or at the Helmet pointed, or the Crest; They vanish from the Barrier, speed the Race, And spurring see decrease the middle Space. A Cloud of Smoke envelops either Host, And all at once the Combatants are lost: Darkling they join adverse, and shock unseen, Coursers with Coursers justling, Men with Men: As lab'ring in Eclipse, a while they stay, Till the next Blast of Wind restores the Day. They look anew: The beauteous Form of Fight Is chang'd, and War appears a grizly Sight. Two Troops in fair Array one Moment show'd, The next, a Field with fallen Bodies strow'd: Not half the Number in their Seats are found; But Men and Steeds lie grov'ling on the Ground. The Points of Spears are stuck within the Shield, The Steeds without their Riders scour the Field. The Knights unhors'd, on Foot renew the Fight; The glitt'ring Fauchions cast a gleaming Light; Hauberks and Helms are hew'd with many a Wound; Out spins the streaming Blood, and dies the Ground. The mighty Maces with such Haste descend, They break the Bones, and make the solid Armour bend. This thrusts amid the Throng with furious Force; Down goes at once the Horseman and the Horse: That Courser stumbles on the fallen Steed, And floundring, throws the Rider o'er his Head. One rolls along, a Foot-ball to his Foes; One with a broken Truncheon deals his Blows. This halting, this disabled with his Wound, In Triumph led, is to the Pillar bound, Where by the King's Award he must abide: There goes a Captive led on t'other Side. By Fits they cease; and leaning on the Lance, Take Breath a while, and to new Fight advance. Full oft the Rivals met, and neither spar'd His utmost Force, and each forgot to ward. The Head of this was to the Saddle bent, That other backward to the Crupper sent: Both were by Turns unhors'd; the jealous Blows Fall thick and heavy, when on Foot they close. So deep their Fauchions bite, that ev'ry Stroke Pierc'd to the Quick; and equal Wounds they gave and took. Borne far asunder by the Tides of Men, Like Adamant and Steel they meet agen. So when a Tiger sucks a Bullock's Blood, A famish'd Lion issuing from the Wood Roars Lordly fierce, and challenges the Food. Each claims Possession, neither will obey, But both their Paws are fasten'd on the Prey: They bite, they tear; and while in vain they strive, The Swains come arm'd between, and both to distance drive. At length, as Fate fore-doom'd, and all things tend By Course of Time to their appointed End; So when the Sun to West was far declin'd, And both afresh in mortal Battle join'd, The strong Emetrius came in Arcite's Aid, And Palamon with Odds was overlaid: For turning short, he struck with all his Might Full on the Helmet of th' unwary Knight. Deep was the Wound; he stagger'd with the Blow, And turn'd him to his unexpected Foe; Whom with such Force he struck, he fell'd him down, And cleft the Circle of his Golden Crown. But Arcite's Men, who now prevail'd in Fight, Twice Ten at once surround the single Knight: O'erpower'd at length, they force him to the Ground, Unyielded as he was, and to the Pillar bound; And King Lycurgus, while he fought in vain His Friend to free, was tumbled on the Plain. Who now laments but Palamon, compell'd No more to try the Fortune of the Field! And worse than Death, to view with hateful Eyes His Rival's Conquest, and renounce the Prize! The Royal Judge on his Tribunal plac'd, Who had beheld the Fight from first to last, Bade cease the War; pronouncing from on high “Arcite of Thebes had won the beauteous Emily.” The Sound of Trumpets to the Voice reply'd, And round the Royal Lists the Heralds cry'd, “Arcite of Thebes has won the beauteous Bride.” The People rend the Skies with vast Applause; All own the Chief, when Fortune owns the Cause. Arcite is own'd ev'n by the Gods above, And conqu'ring Mars insults the Queen of Love. So laugh'd he, when the rightful Titan fail'd, And Jove's usurping Arms in Heav'n prevail'd. Laugh'd all the Pow'rs who favour Tyranny; And all the standing Army of the Sky. But Venus with dejected Eyes appears, And weeping, on the Lists distill'd her Tears; Her Will refus'd, which grieves a Woman most, And in her Champion foil'd, the Cause of Love is lost. Till Saturn said, “Fair Daughter, now be still, “The blustring Fool has satisfy'd his Will: “His Boon is giv'n; his Knight has gain'd the Day, “But lost the Prize, th' Arrears are yet to pay. “Thy Hour is come, and mine the Care shall be “To please thy Knight, and set thy Promise free.” Now while the Heralds run the Lists around, And Arcite, Arcite, Heav'n and Earth resound; A Miracle (nor less it could be call'd) Their Joy with unexpected Sorrow pall'd. The Victor Knight had laid his Helm aside, Part for his Ease, the greater Part for Pride: Bare-headed, popularly low he bow'd, And paid the Salutations of the Crowd. Then spurring at full Speed, ran endlong on Where Theseus sate on his Imperial Throne; Furious he drove, and upward cast his Eye, Where next the Queen was plac'd his Emily; Then passing, to the Saddle-bow he bent, A sweet Regard the gracious Virgin lent: (For Women, to the Brave an easy Prey, Still follow Fortune, where she leads the Way:) Just then, from Earth sprung out a flashing Fire, By Pluto sent, at Saturn's bad Desire: The startling Steed was seiz'd with sudden Fright, And, bounding, o'er the Pummel cast the Knight: Forward he flew, and pitching on his Head, He quiver'd with his Feet, and lay for Dead. Black was his Count'nance in a little space, For all the Blood was gather'd in his Face. Help was at hand; they rear'd him from the Ground, And from his cumb'rous Arms his Limbs unbound; Then lanc'd a Vein, and watch'd returning Breath; It came, but clogg'd with Symptoms of his Death. The Saddle-bow the noble Parts had prest, All bruis'd and mortify'd his manly Breast. Him still entranc'd, and in a Litter laid, They bore from Field, and to his Bed convey'd. At length he wak'd, and with a feeble Cry, The Word he first pronounc'd was Emily. Mean time the King, tho' inwardly he mourn'd, In Pomp triumphant to the Town return'd, Attended by the Chiefs, who sought the Field; (Now friendly mix'd, and in one Troop compell'd.) Compos'd his Looks to counterfeited Cheer, And bade them not for Arcite's Life to fear. But that which gladded all the Warrior Train, Tho' most were sorely wounded, none were slain. The Surgeons soon despoil'd them of their Arms, And some with Salves they cure, and some with Charms. Foment the Bruises, and the Pains asswage, And heal their inward Hurts with sov'reign Draughts of Sage. The King in Person visits all around, Comforts the Sick, congratulates the Sound; Honours the Princely Chiefs, rewards the rest, And holds for thrice three Days a Royal Feast. None was disgrac'd; for Falling is no Shame; And Cowardice alone is loss of Fame. The vent'rous Knight is from the Saddle thrown; But 'tis the Fault of Fortune, not his own. If Crowns and Palms the conqu'ring Side adorn, The Victor under better Stars was born: The brave Man seeks not popular Applause, Nor overpow'r'd with Arms deserts his Cause; Unsham'd, though foil'd, he does the best he can; Force is of Brutes, but Honour is of Man. Thus Theseus smil'd on all with equal Grace, And each was set according to his Place. With Ease were reconcil'd the diff'ring Parts, For Envy never dwells in Noble Hearts. At length they took their Leave, the Time expir'd; Well pleas'd; and to their sev'ral Homes retir'd. Mean while the Health of Arcite still impairs; From Bad proceeds to Worse, and mocks the Leeches Cares: Swoln is his Breast; his inward Pains increase, All Means are us'd, and all without Success. The clotted Blood lies heavy on his Heart, Corrupts, and there remains in spite of Art: Nor breathing Veins, nor Cupping will prevail; All outward Remedies and inward fail: The Mold of Nature's Fabrick is destroy'd, Her Vessels discompos'd, her Virtue void: The Bellows of his Lungs begin to swell: All out of Frame is ev'ry secret Cell, Nor can the Good receive, nor Bad expel. Those breathing Organs thus within opprest, With Venom soon distend the Sinews of his Breast. Nought profits him to save abandon'd Life, Nor Vomits upward aid, nor downward Laxatife. The midmost Region batter'd, and destroy'd, When Nature cannot work, th' Effect of Art is void. For Physick can but mend our crazy State, Patch an old Building, not a new create. Arcite is doom'd to die in all his Pride, Must leave his Youth, and yield his beauteous Bride, Gain'd hardly, against Right, and unenjoy'd. When 'twas declar'd all Hope of Life was past, Conscience (that of all Physick works the last) Caus'd him to send for Emily in haste. With her, at his Desire, came Palamon; Then on his Pillow rais'd, he thus begun. “No Language can express the smallest Part “Of what I feel, and suffer in my Heart, “For you, whom best I love and value most; “But to your Service I bequeath my Ghost; “Which from this mortal Body when unty'd, “Unseen, unheard, shall hover at your Side; “Nor fright you waking, nor your Sleep offend, “But wait officious, and your Steps attend: “How I have lov'd, excuse my falt'ring Tongue, “My Spirits feeble, and my Pains are strong: “This I may say, I only grieve to die, “Because I lose my charming Emily: “To die, when Heav'n had put you in my Pow'r, “Fate could not chuse a more malicious Hour! “What greater Curse could envious Fortune give, “Than just to die, when I began to live! “Vain Men, how vanishing a Bliss we crave, “Now warm in Love, now with'ring in the Grave! “Never, O never more to see the Sun! “Still dark, in a damp Vault, and still alone! “This Fate is common; but I lose my Breath “Near Bliss, and not yet bless'd before my Death. “Farewel; but take me dying in your Arms, “'Tis all I can enjoy of all your Charms: “This Hand I cannot but in Death resign; “Ah, could I live! But while I live 'tis mine. “I feel my End approach, and thus embrac'd, “Am pleas'd to die:—but hear me speak my last. “Ah! my sweet Foe, for you, and you alone, “I broke my Faith with injur'd Palamon. “But Love the Sense of Right and Wrong confounds, “Strong Love and proud Ambition have no Bounds. “And much I doubt, should Heav'n my Life prolong, “I should return to justifie my Wrong: “For while my former Flames remain within, “Repentance is but want of Pow'r to sin. “With mortal Hatred I pursu'd his Life, “Nor he, nor you, were guilty of the Strife; “Nor I, but as I lov'd: Yet all combin'd, “Your Beauty, and my Impotence of Mind; “And his concurrent Flame, that blew my Fire; “For still our Kindred Souls had one Desire. “He had a Moment's Right in point of Time; “Had I seen first, then his had been the Crime. “Fate made it mine, and justify'd his Right; “Nor holds this Earth a more deserving Knight, “For Virtue, Valour, and for Noble Blood, “Truth, Honour, all that is compriz'd in Good; “So help me Heav'n, in all the World is none “So worthy to be lov'd as Palamon. “He loves you too; with such a holy Fire, “As will not, cannot but with Life expire: “Our vow'd Affections both have often try'd, “Nor any Love but yours could ours divide. “Then by my Love's inviolable Band, “By my long Suff'ring, and my short Command, “If e'er you plight your Vows when I am gone, “Have Pity on the faithful Palamon.” This was his last; for Death came on amain, And exercis'd below his Iron Reign; Then upward to the Seat of Life he goes; Sense fled before him, what he touch'd he froze: Yet could he not his closing Eyes withdraw, Though less and less of Emily he saw: So, speechless, for a little Space he lay; Then grasp'd the Hand he held, and sigh'd his Soul away. But whither went his Soul, let such relate Who search the Secrets of the future State: Divines can say but what themselves believe; Strong Proofs they have, but not demonstrative: For, were all plain, then all Sides must agree, And Faith itself be lost in Certainty. To live uprightly then is sure the best, To save ourselves, and not to damn the rest. The Soul of Arcite went, where Heathens go, Who better live than we, tho' less they know. In Palamon a manly Grief appears; Silent, he wept, asham'd to show his Tears: Emilia shriek'd but once, and then oppress'd With Sorrow, sunk upon her Lover's Breast: Till Theseus in his Arms convey'd with Care, Far from so sad a Sight, the swooning Fair. 'Twere loss of Time her Sorrow to relate, Ill bears the Sex a youthful Lover's Fate, When just approaching to the Nuptial State. But like a low hung Cloud, it rains so fast, That all at once it falls, and cannot last. The Face of Things is chang'd, and Athens now, That laugh'd so late, becomes the Scene of Woe: Matrons and Maids, both Sexes, ev'ry State, With Tears lament the Knight's untimely Fate. Not greater Grief in falling Troy was seen For Hector's Death; but Hector was not then. Old Men with Dust deform'd their hoary Hair, The Women beat their Breasts, their Cheeks they tare. “Why wou'dst thou go, with one Consent they cry, “When thou hadst Gold enough, and Emily!” Theseus himself, who shou'd have cheer'd the Grief Of others, wanted now the same Relief. Old Egeus only could revive his Son, Who various Changes of the World had known; And strange Vicissitudes of Human Fate, Still alt'ring, never in a steady State: Good after Ill, and after Pain, Delight; Alternate, like the Scenes of Day and Night: ‘Since ev'ry Man who lives, is born to die, ‘And none can boast sincere Felicity, ‘With equal Mind, what happens, let us bear, ‘Nor joy, nor grieve too much for Things beyond our Care. ‘Like Pilgrims, to th' appointed Place we tend; ‘The World's an Inn, and Death the Journey's End. ‘Ev'n Kings but play; and when their Part is done, ‘Some other, worse or better, mount the Throne.’ With Words like these the Crowd was satisfy'd, And so they would have been, had Theseus dy'd. But he, their King, was lab'ring in the Mind, A fitting Place for Fun'ral Pomps to find, Which were in Honor of the Dead design'd. And after long Debate, at last he found (As Love itself had mark'd the Spot of Ground) That Grove for ever green, that conscious Lawnd, Where he with Palamon fought Hand to Hand; That where he fed his amorous Desires With soft Complaints, and felt his hottest Fires, There other Flames might waste his Earthly Part, And burn his Limbs, where Love had burn'd his Heart. This once resolv'd, the Peasants were enjoin'd Sere-Wood, and Firs, and dodder'd Oaks to find. With sounding Axes to the Grove they go, Fell, split, and lay the Fewel on a Row, Vulcanian Food: A Bier is next prepar'd, On which the lifeless Body should be rear'd, Cover'd with Cloth of Gold, on which was laid The Corps of Arcite, in like Robes array'd. White Gloves were on his Hands, and on his Head A Wreath of Laurel, mix'd with Myrtle, spred. A Sword keen-edg'd within his Right he held, The warlike Emblem of the conquer'd Field: Bare was his manly Visage on the Bier: Menac'd his Count'nance; ev'n in Death severe. Then to the Palace-Hall they bore the Knight, To lie in solemn State, a publick Sight. Groans, Cries, and Howlings fill the crowded Place, And unaffected Sorrow sat on ev'ry Face. Sad Palamon above the rest appears, In sable Garments, dew'd with gushing Tears: His Aubourn Locks on either Shoulder flow'd, Which to the Fun'ral of his Friend he vow'd: But Emily, as Chief, was next his Side, A Virgin-Widow and a Mourning Bride. And that the Princely Obsequies might be Perform'd according to his high Degree, The Steed that bore him living to the Fight, Was trapp'd with polish'd Steel, all shining bright, And cover'd with th' Atchievements of the Knight. The Riders rode abreast, and one his Shield, His Lance of Cornel-Wood another held; The third his Bow, and glorious to behold, The costly Quiver, all of burnish'd Gold. The noblest of the Grecians next appear, And weeping, on their Shoulders bore the Bier; With sober Pace they march'd, and often staid, And thro' the Master-Street the Corps convey'd. The Houses to their Tops with Black were spred, And ev'n the Pavements were with Mourning hid. The Right-side of the Pall old Egeus kept, And on the Left the Royal Theseus wept: Each bore a Golden Bowl of Work Divine, With Honey fill'd, and Milk, and mix'd with ruddy Wine. Then Palamon the Kinsman of the Slain, And after him appear'd th' illustrious Train To grace the Pomp; came Emily the Bright, With cover'd Fire, the Fun'ral Pile to light. With high Devotion was the Service made, And all the Rites of Pagan-Honor paid: So lofty was the Pile, a Parthian Bow, With Vigour drawn, must send the Shaft below. The Bottom was full twenty Fathom broad, With crackling Straw beneath in due Proportion strow'd. The Fabrick seem'd a Wood of rising Green, With Sulphur and Bitumen cast between, To feed the Flames: The Trees were unctuous Fir, And Mountain-Ash, the Mother of the Spear; The Mourner Eugh, and Builder Oak were there: The Beech, the swimming Alder, and the Plane, Hard Box, and Linden of a softer Grain, And Laurels, which the Gods for conqu'ring Chiefs ordain. How they were rank'd, shall rest untold by me, With nameless Nymphs that liv'd in ev'ry Tree; Nor how the Dryads, and the Woodland Train, Disherited, ran howling o'er the Plain: Nor how the the Birds to foreign Seats repair'd, Or Beasts, that bolted out, and saw the Forest bar'd: Nor how the Ground, now clear'd, with ghastly Fright Beheld the sudden Sun, a Stranger to the Light. The Straw, as first I said, was laid below; Of Chips and Sere-wood was the second Row; The third of Greens, and Timber newly fell'd; The fourth high Stage the fragrant Odours held, And Pearls and precious Stones, and rich Array; In midst of which, embalm'd, the Body lay. The Service sung, the Maid with mourning Eyes The Stubble fir'd; the smould'ring Flames arise: This Office done, she sunk upon the Ground; But what she spoke, recover'd from her Swoond, I want the Wit in moving Words to dress; But by themselves the tender Sex may guess. While the devouring Fire was burning fast, Rich Jewels in the Flames the Wealthy cast; And some their Shields, and some their Lances threw, And gave their Warrior's Ghost, a Warrior's Due. Full Bowls of Wine, of Hony, Milk, and Blood, Were pour'd upon the Pile of burning Wood, And hissing Flames receive, and hungry lick the Food. Then thrice the mounted Squadrons ride around The Fire, and Arcite's Name they thrice resound: Hail, and farewel, they shouted thrice amain, Thrice facing to the Left, and thrice they turn'd again: Still as they turn'd, they beat their clatt'ring Shields; The Women mix their Cries; and Clamour fills the Fields. The warlike Wakes continu'd all the Night, And fun'ral Games were play'd at new returning Light: Who naked wrestled best, besmear'd with Oil, Or who with Gantlets gave or took the Foil, I will not tell you, nor wou'd you attend; But briefly haste to my long Story's End. I pass the rest; the Year was fully mourn'd, And Palamon long since to Thebes return'd, When by the Grecians general Consent, At Athens Theseus held his Parliament: Among the Laws that pass'd, it was decreed, That conquer'd Thebes from Bondage shou'd be freed; Reserving Homage to th' Athenian Throne, To which the Sov'reign summon'd Palamon. Unknowing of the Cause, he took his Way, Mournful in Mind, and still in black Array. The Monarch mounts the Throne, and plac'd on high, Commands into the Court the beauteous Emily: So call'd, she came; the Senate rose, and paid Becoming Rev'rence to the Royal Maid. And first soft Whispers through th' Assembly went: With silent Wonder then they watch'd th' Event: All hush'd, the King arose with awful Grace, Deep Thought was in his Breast, and Counsel in his Face. At length he sigh'd; and having first prepar'd Th' attentive Audience, thus his Will declar'd. ‘The Cause and Spring of Motion, from above ‘Hung down on Earth the golden Chain of Love: ‘Great was th' Effect, and high was his Intent, ‘When Peace among the jarring Seeds he sent. ‘Fire, Flood, and Earth, and Air by this were bound, ‘And Love, the common Link, the new Creation crown'd. ‘The Chain still holds; for though the Forms decay, ‘Eternal Matter never wears away: ‘The same first Mover certain Bounds has plac'd, ‘How long those perishable Forms shall last; ‘Nor can they last beyond the Time assign'd ‘By that All-seeing, and All-making Mind: ‘Shorten their Hours they may; for Will is free; ‘But never pass th' appointed Destiny. ‘So Men oppress'd, when weary of their Breath, ‘Throw off the Burden, and suborn their Death. ‘Then since those Forms begin, and have their End, ‘On some unalter'd Cause they sure depend: ‘Parts of the Whole are we; but God the Whole; ‘Who gives us Life, and animating Soul. ‘For Nature cannot from a Part derive ‘That Being, which the Whole can only give: ‘He perfect, stable; but imperfect we, ‘Subject to Change, and diff'rent in Degree. ‘Plants, Beasts, and Man; and as our Organs are, ‘We more or less of his Perfection share. ‘But by a long Descent, th' Etherial Fire ‘Corrupts; and Forms, the mortal Part, expire: ‘As he withdraws his Virtue, so they pass, ‘And the same Matter makes another Mass: ‘This Law th' Omniscient Pow'r was pleas'd to give, ‘That ev'ry Kind should by Succession live: ‘That Individuals die, his Will ordains; ‘The propagated Species still remains. ‘The Monarch Oak, the Patriarch of the Trees, ‘Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow Degrees: ‘Three Centuries he grows, and three he stays ‘Supreme in State, and in three more decays: ‘So wears the paving Pebble in the Street, ‘And Towns and Tow'rs their fatal Periods meet; ‘So Rivers rapid once, now naked lie, ‘Forsaken of their Springs; and leave their Channels dry. ‘So Man, at first a Drop, dilates with Heat, ‘Then form'd, the little Heart begins to beat; ‘Secret he feeds, unknowing in the Cell; ‘At length, for hatching ripe, he breaks the Shell, ‘And struggles into Breath, and cries for Aid; ‘Then, helpless, in his Mother's Lap is laid. ‘He creeps, he walks, and issuing into Man, ‘Grudges their Life, from whence his own began. ‘Retchless of Laws, affects to rule alone, ‘Anxious to reign, and restless on the Throne: ‘First vegetive, then feels, and reasons last; ‘Rich of Three Souls, and lives all three to waste. ‘Some thus; but thousands more in Flow'r of Age: ‘For few arrive to run the latter Stage. ‘Sunk in the first, in Battle some are slain, ‘And others whelm'd beneath the stormy Main. ‘What makes all this, but Jupiter the King, ‘At whose Command we perish, and we spring? ‘Then 'tis our best, since thus ordain'd to die, ‘To make a Virtue of Necessity. ‘Take what he gives, since to rebel is vain; ‘The Bad grows Better, which we well sustain; ‘And cou'd we chuse the Time, and chuse aright, ‘'Tis best to die, our Honor at the Height. ‘When we have done our Ancestors no Shame, ‘But serv'd our Friends, and well secur'd our Fame; ‘Then should we wish our happy Life to close, ‘And leave no more for Fortune to dispose: ‘So should we make our Death a glad Relief ‘From future Shame, from Sickness, and from Grief. ‘Enjoying while we live the present Hour, ‘And dying in our Excellence, and Flow'r. ‘Then round our Death-bed ev'ry Friend shou'd run, ‘And joyous of our Conquest early won: ‘While the malicious World with envious Tears ‘Shou'd grudge our happy End, and wish it theirs. ‘Since then our Arcite is with Honor dead, ‘Why shou'd we mourn, that he so soon is freed, ‘Or call untimely, what the Gods decreed? ‘With Grief as just, a Friend may be deplor'd, ‘From a foul Prison to free Air restor'd. ‘Ought he to thank his Kinsman, or his Wife, ‘Cou'd Tears recall him into wretched Life? ‘Their Sorrow hurts themselves; on him is lost; ‘And, worse than both, offends his happy Ghost. ‘What then remains, but after past Annoy, ‘To take the good Vicissitude of Joy? ‘To thank the gracious Gods for what they give, ‘Possess our Souls, and while we live, to live? ‘Ordain we then two Sorrows to combine, ‘And in one Point th' Extremes of Grief to join; ‘That thence resulting Joy may be renew'd, ‘As jarring Notes in Harmony conclude. ‘Then I propose that Palamon shall be ‘In Marriage join'd with beauteous Emily; ‘For which already I have gain'd th' Assent ‘Of my free People in full Parliament. ‘Long Love to her has borne the faithful Knight, ‘And well deserv'd, had Fortune done him Right: ‘'Tis time to mend her Fault; since Emily, ‘By Arcite's Death, from former Vows is free. ‘If you, Fair Sister, ratify th' Accord, ‘And take him for your Husband, and your Lord, ‘'Tis no Dishonor to confer your Grace ‘On one descended from a Royal Race: ‘And, were he less, yet Years of Service past ‘From grateful Souls exact Reward at last: ‘Pity is Heav'n's and yours: Nor can she find ‘A Throne so soft as in a Woman's Mind.’ He said; she blush'd; and as o'er-aw'd by Might, Seem'd to give Theseus, what she gave the Knight. Then turning to the Theban, thus he said; ‘Small Arguments are needful to persuade ‘Your Temper to comply with my Command;’ And speaking thus, he gave Emilia's Hand. Smil'd Venus, to behold her own true Knight Obtain the Conquest, though he lost the Fight; And bless'd with Nuptial Bliss the sweet laborious Night. Eros, and Anteros, on either Side, One fir'd the Bridegroom, and one warm'd the Bride; And long-attending Hymen from above, Show'r'd on the Bed the whole Idalian Grove. All of a Tenor was their After-Life, No Day discolour'd with Domestick Strife; No Jealously, but mutual Truth believ'd, Secure Repose, and Kindness undeceiv'd. Thus Heav'n, beyond the Compass of his Thought, Sent him the Blessing he so dearly bought. So may the Queen of Love long Duty bless, And all true Lovers find the same Success. End of the Knight's TALE. PROLOGUE TO THE MILLER's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. A Tale so nobly plan'd, and sweetly told! Pleas'd All of either Sex, both Young and Old; But most the Men of Sense, and Men of Taste: Stor'd with such Virtue! With such Beauty grac'd. They judg'd it, for the Stile, and for the Frame, Worthy to stand in the Records of Fame! Our Host all Rapture, “May my Mortal Sins “Be so forgiv'n, as well the Game begins; “By You, Sir Monk, be the next Party play'd; “For You're a Man of Learning by your Trade. “To match the Knight, unbuckle wide the Male, “And to the Full repay him, Tale for Tale.” The Miller, who till then rode void of Thought, All Pale, and Drunken with his Morning Draught, Rose from his Horse, where balancing He sat, And little Rev'rence pay'd to Hood, or Hat; But, lev'ling both the Gentry and the Croud, Exclaim'd, not Pilate half so harsh or loud, And look'd like Ananias on Saint Paul, The very Semblance of a Whited Wall! “A glorious Tale, now comes into my Head; “Then take it, just as I have heard or read. “(The Miller roar'd) Room to the Left and Right, “Nor better cou'd the Monk repay the Knight.” Our Host, the Miller, heard, and judg'd his Case; “Hold, Robin, hold (He cry'd) and know thy Place. “Our Turns come last; then first Our Betters hear! “What, are thy Wits quite overcome with Beer? “Forbear! And go more orderly to Work, “The Christian shou'd not stand behind the Turk.” ‘Christian or Turk, the Miller made Reply, ‘Be silent He that will, that will not I. ‘Bar my Discourse, and I renounce the Play, ‘Hail-Fellow and well met! as Neighbors say; ‘Equal in Company are High and Low: ‘On these Conditions shall I stay, or go?’ “Stay, in the Dev'l's Name, stay, and take thy Will, (Answer'd our Host, who chose the lighter Ill) “What wou'd You more? Begin without Delay: “A Fool Thou art, and Fools must have their Way.” The Miller then; ‘Half Tipsey, by my Soul! ‘Fast as a Mill I feel my Senses rowl! ‘If then in Manners, or in Words I fail, ‘Impute it to the Strength of Southwark Ale. ‘While first I paint in Colours to the Life, ‘A jealous Husband, and a flaunting Wife; ‘He Rich and Old, a Carpenter by Trade! ‘She Young and Handsome, but an errant Jade! ‘And last a Student's Stratagem reveal, ‘Who put a Spoke into the Cuckold's Wheel’. Him interrupts the Reve. ‘Forbear thy Prate; ‘All lewd and drunken Ribaldry I hate; ‘And hold it equally a Sin and Shame, ‘To God, and Man, our Neighbor to defame: ‘Much more the Virtue of his Bosom Spouse, ‘To bring in Question. Spare the Wedded House. ‘Another Subject chuse, the Coast is clear, ‘One fit for You to tell, and Us to hear.’ Not, so reprov'd, the Miller spar'd his Joke, But spoke, and laugh'd full hearty as He spoke. ‘Good Brother Oswalde, I wou'd stake my Life, ‘No Cuckold is the Man who has no Wife; ‘Not that it therefore follows as imply'd, ‘That Thou art one, because in Wedlock ty'd. ‘Yet 'tis a Hazard, rightly understood, ‘Wives there are many bad, and many good. ‘And I as well as Thou, am duly bound, ‘Be Marriage what it will, a Park, or Pound! ‘Yet wou'd not I presume, in Word or Thought, ‘To Sentence Wives more strictly than I ought, ‘Or deem that Mine had slyly branch'd my Brow, ‘No, not for all the Oxen in my Plow; ‘Content, to hope the Best, good Master Reve, ‘For I'm a perfect Christian, and believe; ‘Nay more, to lay Partiality aside, ‘All Jealousy, is Av'rice mixt with Pride; ‘A Wish, to lay in Hoard, or keep for Show ‘More than we want; as Wives and Husbands know. ‘Then rate not by the lost, but by the giv'n, ‘The Goods of Wisehood, as the Goods of Heav'n. ‘Tho' some by Blasts of Wind are borne away, ‘And some to thievish Birds may fall a Prey; ‘If still Enough for Dayly Use remains, ‘Why wail the supernumerary Grains?’ What need of Words, the Prelude to prolong? Nought cou'd restrain the Torrent of his Tongue; For down He bore Us, with impetuous Sway, And told his Tale in his own Churlish Way. But not, to our Account, his Licence state, If what he spoke, we faithfully relate. Bound to the Truth, by Duty and by Force, As Man to Wife, for Better and for Worse; The Tale we must recount without Disguise, Such as it was; in This no Medium lies. Then timely warn'd, ye modest Virgins fly, Nor curious lend an Ear, nor cast an Eye. Here stop, and cautious further to ingage, Turn the loose Leaf, and chuse a chaster Page. Others, and many such, remain behind, Unspotted Stories suited to your Mind; Some fitted to instruct and to delight, The Subject moral, and the Turn polite; To Hist'ry, some that raise a bolder Wing, And some that ev'n of Sacred Myst'ries sing. Then blame not us, nor on our Labors frown; We tell you plain, the Miller is a Clown! A Clown the Reve! the Journey to beguile, Who talk'd of Love, in Nature's naked Stile. Nor take in Serious what is meant in Sport, We scorn to trap you with unfair Report. The Good and Bad to your Election leave, Condemn not us, if you yourselves deceive. But if the Prohibition more intice, For Curiosity may want Advice, Convey the Ribaldry from Vulgar Sight, Peruse it in the Closet, and by Night; Or with a female Friend in private read, So may the Miller, if you chuse, proceed. End of the Prologue. THE CARPENTER of OXFORD: OR, THE MILLER's TALE. By Mr. COBB. Whilom in Oxford an old Chuff did dwell, A Carpenter by Trade, as Stories tell; Who by his Craft had heap'd up many a Hoard, And furnish'd Strangers both with Bed and Board. With him a Scholar lodg'd, of slender Means, But notable for Sciences and Sense. Yet, tho' he took Degrees in Arts, his Mind Was mostly to Astrology inclin'd. A Lad in Divination skill'd and shrewd, Who by Interrogations could conclude, If Men should ask him at what certain Hours The droughty Earth would gape for cooling Show'rs, When it should Rain, or Snow, what should befall Of Fifty Things; I cannot reckon all. This learned Clerk had got a mighty Fame For Modesty, and Nicholas his Name. Subtle he was, well taught in Cupid's Trade, But seem'd as Meek, and Bashful as a Maid. A Chamber in this Hostelry he kept, Alone he study'd, and alone he slept. With sweet and fragant Herbs the Room was drest, But he was ten times sweeter than the best. His Books of various size, or great, or small, His Augrim Stones to cast Accounts withal; His Astrolabe and Almagist The Name of a Book of Astronomy, written by Ptolemy. apart, With twenty more hard Names of cunning Art; On sev'ral Shelves were couched nigh his Bed, And the Press cover'd with a folding Red. Above an Instrument of Music lay, On which sweet Melody he us'd to play; So wond'rous sweet, that all the Chamber rung, And Angelus ad Virginem The Angel's Salutation to the Virgin Mary. he sung; Then would he Chaunt in good King David's Note, Full often blessed was his merry Throat. And thus the Clerk in Books and Music spent His Time, and Exhibition's yearly Rent. This Carpenter had a new marry'd Wife, Lov'd as his Eyes, and dearer than his Life. The Buxom Lass had twice Nine Summers seen And her brisk Blood ran high in ev'ry Vein. The Dotard, jealous of so ripe an Age, Watch'd her, and lock'd her, like a Bird in Cage. For she was Wild, and in her lovely Prime; But he, poor Man! walk'd down the Hill of Time. He knew the Temper of a Youthful Spouse, And oft was seen to rub his aking Brows. He knew his own weak side, and dreamt in Bed She had, or would be planting on his Head. He knew not Cato, for his Wit was rude; That Men should Wed with their Similitude. Like should with Like in Love and Years ingage, For Youth can never be a Rhyme to Age. Hence Jealousies create a Nuptial War, And the warm Seasons with the frigid jar. But when the Trap's once down, he must endure His Fate, and Patience is the only Cure. Perhaps his Father, and a hundred more Of honest Christians, were thus serv'd before. Fair was his charming Consort, and withall Slender her Waist, and like a Weasel's small. She had a Girdle round her barr'd with Silk, And a clean Apron, white as Morrow Milk. White was her Smock, embroider'd all before, Which on her Loins in many Plaits she wore. Broad was her silken Fillet, set full high, And oft she twinkled with a Liqu'rish Eye. Her Brow was arch'd like any bended Bow, Like Marble smooth, and blacker than a Sloe, She softer far than Wool, or fleecy Snow. Were you to search the Universal Round, So gay a Wench was never to be found. With greater Brightness did her Colour shine, Than a new Noble of the freshest Coin. Shrill was her Song, and loud her piercing Note, No Swallow on a Barn had such a Throat. To this she skipp'd and caper'd like a Lamb, Or Kid, or Calf, when they pursue their Dam. Sweet as Metheglin was her Honey Lip, Or Hoard of Apples which in Hay are kept. Wincing she was, as is a jolly Colt, Long as a Mast, and upright as a Bolt: Above her Ancles laced was her Shoe, She was a Primrose, and a Pigsnye too. And fit to lig by any Christian's Side, Or a Lord's Mistress, or a Yeoman's Bride. Now Sirs, what think you, how the Case befell? This Nicholas (for I the Truth will tell) Was a mere Wag, and on a certain Day, When the Good Man, the Husband, was away, Began to sport and wanton with his Dame, (For Clerks are sly, and very full of Game) And privily he caught her by That same. “My Lemman Mistress. Dear (quoth he) I'm all on Fire, “And perish, if you grant not my Desire. He clasp her round, and held her fast, and cry'd, “O let me, let me—never be deny'd.” At this she wreath'd her Head, and sprung aloof, Like a young frisking Colt, whose tender Hoof Felt never Farrier's Hand, and never knew The Virgin Burden of an Iron Shoe. ‘Fye Nicholas! away your Hands, quoth she: ‘Is this your Breeding, and Civility? ‘Foh! Idle Sot! what means th' unmanner'd Clown, ‘To teize me thus, and toss me up and down? ‘I vow I'll tell, and bawl it o'er the Town. ‘You're rude, and will you not be answer'd, No? ‘I will not kiss you—prithee, let me go.’ Here Nicholas, a young, designing Knave, Began to weep, and cant, and Pardon crave. So fair he spoke, and importun'd so fast, This seeming modest Spouse consents at last. By good St. Thomas St. Thomas Becket. swore, her usual Oath, That she would meet his Love—tho' mighty loath. ‘If you, said she, convenient Leisure wait, ‘(You know my Husband has a jealous Pate) ‘I will requite you; for if once the Beast ‘Should chance to find us out, and smell the Jest, ‘I must be a dead Woman at the least.’ “Let that, quoth Nicholas, ne'er vex your Head; “He must be a meer learned Ass indeed, “And very foolishly besets his Wile, “Who cannot a dull Carpenter beguile.” And thus they were accorded, thus they swore To wait the Time, as I have said before. And now, when Nicholas had wore away The pleasant Time, in harmless am'rous Play, To his melodious Psaltery he flew, Play'd Tunes of Love, by which his Passion grew, Then printed on her Lips a dear Adieu. It happen'd thus, (I cannot rightly tell, If it on Easter or on Whitson fell) That on a Holyday, this modest Dame To Church, with other honest Neighbours came, In a good Fit to hear the Parson preach What the Divine Apostles us'd to teach. Bright was her Forehead, and no Summer's Day Shone half so clear, so tempting, and so gay. Now to this Parish did a Clerk belong, Who many a Time had rais'd a Holy Song: His Name was Absalon, a silly Man, Who curl'd his Hair, which strutted like a Fan; And from his jolly, pert, and empty Head, In Golden Ringlets on his Shoulders spred. His Face was Red, his Eyes as Grey as Goose, With St. Paul's Windows figur'd on his Shoes. Full properly he walk'd in Scarlet Hose, But light, and Silver-colour'd were his Clothes, And Surplice white as Blossoms on the Rose. Thick Poynts and Tassels did the Coxcomb please, And fetously they dangled on his Knees. He could let Blood, and shave your Beard, or Head, But a mere Barber Surgeon by his Trade. Nay, he cou'd draw a Bond, and learnt from France, In thirty Motions how to trip, and dance. Nay, he cou'd write and Read, and that is more Than twenty Parish-Clreks could do before: Could frisk and toss his twirling Legs in Air, Nice were his Feet, and trod it to a Hair. Songs would he play, and, not to hide his Wit, Would squeak a Treble to his squawling Kit; His Dress was finical, his Music queer, And pleas'd a Tapster's Eye or Drawer's Ear. No Tavern, Brew-house, Ale-House in the Town, Was to the gentle Absalon unknown: But he was very careful of his Wind, And never let it sally out behind; To give the Devil his Due, he had an Art By civil Speech to win a Lady's Heart. This Absalon, so jolly, spruce and gay, Went with the Censer on the Sabbath Day. He swung the Incense Pot with comely Grace, But chiefly would he Fume a pretty Face. His wanton Eye, which every where he cast, Dwelt on the Carpenter's fine Dame at last. So sweet and proper was his lovely Wife, That he could freely gaze away his Life. Were he a Cat, this pretty Mouse would feel Too soon his Talons, a delicious Meal. And now had Cupid shot a piercing Dart, As wet the Feathers in his wounded Heart. No Offering of the Handsome Wives he took, He wanted nothing but a smiling Look, The Parish Fees refus'd, and said, the Light Of the fair Moon shines brightest in the Night. Soon as the Cock had bid the Morning rise, The smitten Lover to his Fiddle flies. A hideous Noise his squeaking Trillos make, And all the drowsy Neighbourhood awake. At the lov'd House some am'rous Tunes he play'd, And thus with gentle Voice he sung or said. Now dear Lady, If thy Will be, I pray to Thee To pity me. And twenty such complaining Notes he sung, Alike the Music of his Kit, and Tongue. At this the staring Carpenter awoke, And thus his Wife, fair Alison, bespoke. “Art Thou asleep, or art Thou deaf, my Dear? “And cannot Absalon at Window hear? “How with his Serenade he charms us all, “Chanting melodiously beneath our Wall?” ‘Yes, yes, I hear him, Alison reply'd, ‘Too well, God wot,’ and then she turn'd aside. Thus went Affairs, till Absalon, alas! Was a lost Creature, a mere whining Ass. All Night he wakes, and sighs, and wears away On his broad Locks and Dress, the live-long Day. To such a Height his doating Fondness grew, To kiss the Ground, and wipe her very Shoe. Where're she went, he like a Slave pursu'd, With spiced Ale, and sweet Metheglin woo'd. All Dainties he could rap and rend, he got, And sent her Tarts and Custards piping hot. He spar'd no Cost for an expensive Treat, Of Mead and Cyder, and all Sorts of Meat. Throbbing he sings with his lamenting Throat, And rivals Philomela's mournful Note. With Rigour some, and some with gentle Arts Have found a Passage to Young Ladies Hearts: Some Wealth has won, and some have had the Lot To fall inamour'd of a Treating Sot. Sometimes he Scaramouch'd it all on high, And Harlequin'd it with Activity. Betrays the Lightness of his empty Head, And how he could cut Capers in a Bed. But neither this, nor that, the Damsel move, For Nicholas has swept the Stakes of Love. The Parish Clerk has nothing met but Scorn, And may go Fiddle now, or blow his Horn. Thus gentle Absalon is made her Ape, And all his Passion turn'd into a Jape. For Nicholas is always in her Eye: True says the Proverb, that the Nigh are Sly. A distant Love may Disappointment find, For out of Sight is ever out of Mind. The Scholar was at hand, as I have told, And gave the Parish Clerk the Dog to hold. Now Nicholas thy Craft and Cunning try, That Absalon may De Profundis cry. Now when this Carpenter was call'd away To Work at Osney, on a certain Day; The subtle Scholar, and his wanton Spouse, Were decently contriving for his Brows: Agreed, that Nicholas should shape a Wile, Her addle-pated Husband to beguile. And, if so be the Game succeeded right, She then would sleep within his Arms all Night. For both were in this one Desire concern'd, Alike they Suffer'd, and alike they Burn'd. Strait a new Thought leapt cross the Scholar's Head, Who at that Instant to his Chamber fled. But to relieve his Thirst and Hunger, bore Of Meat and Liquor a substantial Store, And victual'd it for one long Day, or more. “Alce, shou'd your Husband ask for Us (quoth he) “Reply in Scorn, What's Nicholas to me? “Am I his Keeper? help your silly Head! “Perhaps the Man is mad, asleep, or dead; “My Maid indeed has thump'd this Hour or more, “And knock'd as if she'd thunder down the Door: “But He, a moaping Drone, no Answer gave, “Fast as a Church, and silent as the Grave.” Thus did one Saturday entire consume, Since Nicholas had lock'd him in his Room. Nor was he Idle; for no Lent he kept, But eat, like other Men, and drank, and slept. Did what he list, till the next Sun was new, And went to Rest, as common Mortals do. This Carpenter was in a grievous Pain, Lest Nicholas should over-work his Brain; By Study lose his Reason, or his Life— ‘Well, by St. Thomas, I don't like it, Wife. ‘The World we live in, is a ticklish Place, ‘And sudden Death has often stopt our Race. ‘I saw a Corpse, as to the Church it past, ‘And the poor Man at work but Monday last. ‘Run, Dick, quoth he, run speedily up Stairs, ‘Thump at the Door, and see how stand Affairs.’ Up strait he runs, like any Tempest flies, And knocks, and bawls, and like a Madman cries. “Hoh! Master Nicholas, what mean you thus “To sleep all Night and Day, and frighten Us?” He might as well have whistl'd to the Wind, As from good Nicholas an Answer find. At last he spy'd a Hole, full low, and deep, Where usually the Cat was wont to creep; Here was discover'd to his wond'ring Sight, The Scholar gazing with his Eyes upright, As if intent upon the Stars and Moon: And down runs He, to tell his Master soon, In what Array he saw this studious Man. The Carpenter to cross himself began: And cry'd, ‘St. Frideswild, help us one and all! ‘Little we know what Fate shall us befall. ‘This Man with his Astronomy is got ‘Into some Frenzy, and stark mad, God wot. ‘This comes of poring on his cunning Books, ‘Of his Moon-snuffing, and Star-peeping Looks. ‘Why should a silly Earth-born Mortal pry ‘On Heav'n, and search the Secrets of the Sky? ‘Well fare those Men, who no more Learning need ‘Than what's contain'd in the Lord's Pray'r and Creed, ‘Scholars sufficient, if they can but Read! ‘Thus far'd a Sage Philosopher Thales. of Old, ‘Who walking out, as 'tis in Story told, ‘Was so much with Astronomy bewitch'd, ‘That his Star-gazing Clerkship was beditch'd. ‘Ill Luck attends the Man, who looks too high, ‘And can a Star, but not a Marl-pit spy. ‘But, by St. Thomas, this shall never pass; ‘Too well I love this gentle Nicholas. ‘I'll ferret him, unless the Devil's in it, ‘From his brown Fit of Study in a Minute. ‘Robin, let's try if that an Iron Pur ‘And your strong Back can make this Scholar stir.’ Now Robin was a Lad of Brawn and Bones, And by the Hasp heav'd up the Door at once, Which in the Chamber fell with dreadful Sound, As would a Man, like you or me, astound. But Nicholas, did nothing do but stare; And like a Statue gape upon the Air. This Carpenter was in a piteous Fear, Because he did not, or he would not hear. Thought some deep Melancholy had impair'd His Brain, and that of Mercy he despair'd; For which the Student in his Arms he took With might and main, and by the Shoulders shook. ‘Cry'd, Nicholas, awake! what? not a Word? ‘Look down, despair not—think upon the Lord! Then the Night-Spell he mumbled to himself: ‘Bless thee from Fiends, and every wicked Elf! He crost the Threshold, where a Dev'l might creep, And each small Hole, thro' which an Imp might peep; With solemn Pater Nosters blest the Door, And Ave Marys after and before. At this the Clerk sent forth a heavy Sigh, With Tears, and woful Tone began to cry— And shall this World be lost so soon? Ah! why? ‘What do I hear? the Carpenter reply'd, ‘What say'st Thou, Nicholas? sure Thou art beside ‘Thy self: Serve God, as we poor Lab'rers do, ‘And then no Harm, nor Danger will ensue.’ “Ah! Friend, quoth Nicholas, you little think “What I can tell; but first let's have some Drink. “Then, my dear Host, Thou shalt in private learn “Some certain things, which Thee and Me concern. “It shall no Mortal but your self avail; “Then fetch a Winchester of mighty Ale.” And now when both had drank an equal Share, Cries Nicholas, “Sit down, and draw your Chair. “But first, sweet Landlord, you must take an Oath, “To no Man living to betray thy Troth. “For, trust me, what I'm going to relate “Is Revelation, and as sure as Fate. “And if you tell, this Vengeance will ensue, “No Hare in March will be so Mad as You.” ‘Nay, quoth mine Host, I am no Blab, not I, ‘And hang me, if you catch me in a Lye. ‘I would not tell, tho' 'twere to save my Life, ‘To Chick or Child, to Man, or Maid, or Wife.’ “Now, John, quoth Nicholas, I will not hide “What by my Art I have of late descry'd; “How, as I por'd upon fair Cynthia's Light, “Should fall, on Monday next, at Quarter Night, “A Rain so sudden, and so long to boot, “That Noah's Flood was but a Spoonful to't. “This World within the Compass of an Hour “Shall all be drown'd, so hideous is the Show'r, “As will the Cattle, and Mankind devour.” Cries then this silly Man, ‘Alas, my Wife! ‘My Bosom-comfort, and my better Life! ‘And must She drown, and perish with the Rest? ‘My Alison, the Darling of my Breast?’ At this well nigh he swoon'd o'er-whelm'd with Grief, Fetch'd a deep Sigh, ‘And is there no Relief; ‘No Remedy, he cry'd, no Succour left? ‘Are we, alas! of ev'ry Hope bereft?’ “No, by no Means, quoth this designing Clerk; “Be of good Heart, and by Instruction Work. “For if by Nicholas you will be led, “And build no Castles in your own wild Head, “None so secure: for Solomon says true, “Work all by Counsel, and you cannot rue. “If you'll be govern'd, and be rul'd by me, “I'll undertake to save Thy Wife and Thee; “By my own Art against the Flood prevail, “And make no Use of either Mast or Sail. “Have you not heard, how, when the World was naught, “Noah, by Heav'nly Inspiration taught’— ‘(Ay, ay, quoth John, I've in my Bible found ‘That once upon a Time the World was drown'd,’) “Hast thou not heard, how Noah was concern'd “For his dear Wife, and how his Bowels yearn'd, “Till he had built and furnish'd out a Bark, “And lodged her, with her Children in the Ark? “Now Expedition is the Soul and Life “Of Business; if you love Yourself or Wife, “Run, Fly—for in this Case it is a Crime “To loyter, or to lose an Inch of Time. “For Alison, Yourself, and Me provide “Three Kneading-Troughs, to sail upon the Tide. “But take most special Care, that they be large, “In which a Man may swim as in a Barge. “Let them be victual'd well, and see you lay “Sufficient Stores against a rainy Day; “Enough to serve You twenty Hours, and more, “For then the Flood will swage, and not before. “But one thing let me whisper in your Ear, “Let not thy sturdy Servant Robin hear, “Nor bonny Gillian know what I relate; “I must not utter the Decrees of Fate. “Ask me not Reasons why I cannot save “Your trusty Serving-Maid, and honest Knave: “Suffice it thee, unless Thy Wits be mad, “To have as great a Grace, as Noah had. “Do you make Haste, and mind the grand Affair; “To save your Wife shall be my proper Care. “But when these Kneading-Tubs are ready made, “Which may secure us, when the Floods invade, “See that you hang them in the Roof full high, “That none our Providential Plot descry. “And when Thou hast convey'd sufficient Store “Of Meats and Drink, as I have said before, “And put a sharp'ned Ax in ev'ry Boat, “To cut the Cord, and set us all afloat; “Then thro' the Gable of the House, which lies “Above the Stable, and the Garden spies, “Break out a Hole, so very large and wide, “Thro' which our Tubs may sail upon the Tide. “Then wilt thou so much Mirth and Pleasure take “In swimming, as the white Duck and the Drake. “Then when I cry, Hoh! Alison, and John, “Be merry; for the Flood will pass anon. “Then wilt thou answer, Master Nicholay; “Good morrow, for I see it is broad Day. “Then shall we reign, as Emperors for Life, “O'er all the World, like Noah and his Wife. “But one thing I almost forgot to tell, “Which now comes in my Head, (and mark me well) “That on that very Night we go aboard, “All must be hush'd, and whisper not a Word. “But all the Time employ our holy Mind “In earnest Prayers: For thus has Heav'n injoin'd. “You and your Wife must take a separate Place, “Nor is there any Sin in such a Case. “To morrow Night, when Men are fast asleep, “We to our Kneading-Tubs will slyly creep. “There will we sit, each in his Ship apart, “And wait the Deluge with a patient Heart. “Go now; I have no longer time to spare “In Sermoning, use expeditious Care. “Your Apprehension needs no more Advice: “One single Word's sufficient for the Wise. “And none, dear Landord, can your Wit inform; “Go, save our Lives from this impending Storm.” Away hies John, with melancholy Look, And sigh'd, and groan'd, at ev'ry Step he took. To Alison he does his Fate deplore, And tells a Secret which she knew before. But yet she trembl'd, like an Aspin Leaf, And seem'd to perish with dissembled Grief; Crying, “Alas! What shall I do?—begone— “Help us to 'scape, or we are all undone. “I am thy true and very wedded Wife; “Go, dear, dear Spouse, and help to save my Life.” What strong Impressions does Affection give? By Fancy, Men have often ceas'd to live. Howe're absurd things in themselves appear, Weak Minds are apt to credit what they fear. This silly Carpenter is almost Wood, And thinks of nothing else, but Noah's Flood. Believes he sees it, and begins to quake, And all for Alison, his Hony's Sake. He's over-run with Sorrow and with Fear, And sends forth many a Groan and many a Tear. A Kneading-Trough, a Tub, and Kemelin A Brewer's Vessel. He gets by Stealth, and sends them to his Inn. He makes three Ladders, whence he climbs aloof, And privately he hangs them in the Roof. But first he victual'd them, both Trough and Tub, With Bread and Cheese, and Bottles fill'd with mighty Bub; Enough o'Conscience to relieve their Fast, And be sufficient for a Day's Repast. But e're this Preparation had been made, He sent to London both his Man and Maid, On certain Matters, which concern'd his Trade. And now came on the fatal Monday Night, Barr'd are the Doors, out goes the Candle-Light. And when all things in Readiness were set, These Three their Ladders take, and up they get. Now Pater-Noster, A Note of Silence. clum, said Alison, And clum, quoth Nicholas, and clum, quoth John. This Carpenter his Orisons did say, For Men in fear are very apt to pray. Silent he waited, when the Skies would pour This unaccountable and dismal Show'r. And now at Curfew Curfew. WILLIAM the Conqueror, in the first Year of his Reign, commanded that in every Town, and Village a Bell should be rung every Night, at eight of the Clock, and that all People should then put out their Fire and Candle and go to Bed. The Ringing of this Bell was call'd Curfew, that is, Cover Fire. time, dead Sleep began To fall upon this easy, simple Man. Who after so much Care and Bus'ness past, And spent with sad Concern, was quickly fast. Soft down the Ladder stole this loving Pair, Good Nicholas, and Alison the Fair; Then, without speaking, to the Bed they creep Of John, poor Cuckold! who was fast asleep. There all the Night they revel, sport, and toy, And act the merry Scene of am'rous Joy; Till that the Bell of Lauds began to ring, And the fat Fryars in the Chancel sing. The Parish Clerk, this am'rous Absalon, Who over Head and Ears in Love is gone, At Osney happen'd with a jovial Crew To spend the Monday, as they us'd to do; There pulls a certain Fryar by the Sleeve, With Pardon begg'd, and Father, by your Leave, “When saw yon John the Carpenter? he cries”. ‘Last Saturday, the Cloisterer replies, ‘Since then I have not seen him with these Eyes; ‘Perhaps abroad he's playing fast and loose; ‘Or fetching Timber for the Abbot's Use, ‘And lodges at the Graunge a Day or two, ‘Or else at Home—I know no more than you.’ This made Nab's boiling Blood with Pleasure start, The News rejoyc'd the Cockles of his Heart. “Now is my Time, thinks he; the Moon is bright, “Nor care I, if I travel all the Night; “For at his Door since Day began to spring, “I've seen, like him, no kind of Man, or Thing. “It is resolv'd; to Alison I'll go, “When the first Morning Cock begins to crow; “And to her Window privately repair, “Then knock, and tell her my tormenting Care. “I'll open all my Breast, and ease my Heart, “For 'tis too much to bear Love's stinging Smart. “Some little Comfort sure I shall not miss, “At least she'll grant the Favour of a Kiss; “My Mouth has itch'd all Day, from whence it seems, “That I shall kiss: Besides my pleasant Dreams “Of Feasts and Banquets, whence a Man may guess “That I may haply meet with some Success: “But for an Hour or two before I go, “I'll first refresh me with a Nap, or so.” Now the first Cock had wak'd from his Repose The jolly Absalon, and up he rose. But first he dresses finical and gay, And looks like any Beau, at Church or Play, And brisk as Bridegroom on a Wedding-Day. Nicely he combs the Ringlets of his Hair, And wash'd with Rose-water, looks fresh and fair; Then with his Finger he her Window twang'd, Whisper'd a gentle Tone, and thus harangu'd. Sweet Alison, my Hony-comb, my Dear, My Bird, my Cinamon, your Lover hear. Awake, and speak one Word before I part, But one kind Word, the Balsam to my Heart. Little you think, alas! the mighty Woe, Which for the Love of Thee I undergo. For Thee I swelter, and for Thee I sweat, And mourn as Lamb-kins for the Mother's Teat. Nor false my Grief, nor does the Turtle Dove Lament more truly, or more truly love. I cannot eat nor drink, and all for Thee— “Get from my Window, you Jack Fool, said she; “I love another of a different Hue “From such a silly Dunder-head as you. “If you stand talking at that foolish Rate, “My Chamber-pot shall be about your Pate. “Begone, you empty Sot, and let me sleep”— At this poor Absalon began to weep, And his hard Fate with Sighs and Groans deplore, Was ever faithful Love thus serv'd before! Since then, my Sweet, what I desire's in vain, Let me but one small Boon, a Kiss, obtain. “And will you then be gone, nor loyter here,” Quoth Alison?—Ay certainly, my Dear! “Make ready then”—Now, Nicholas, lye still, 'Tis such a Jest, that you shall laugh your fill. Ravish'd with Joy, Nab fell upon his Knees, The happiest Man alive in all Degrees; In silent Raptures he began to cry, No Lord in Europe is so blest as I. I may expect more Favours; for a Kiss Is an Assurance of a further Bliss. The Window now unclasp'd, with slender Voice, Cries Alison, “Be quick, and make no Noise; “I would not for the World our Neighbours hear, “For they're made up of Jealousy and Fear.” Then silken Handkerchief from Pocket came, To wipe his Mouth full clean to kiss the Dame. Dark was the Night, as any Coal or Pitch, When at the Window she clapt out her Breech. The Parish Clerk ne'er doubted what to do, But ask'd no Questions, and in haste fell to; On her blind Side full savourly he prest A loving Kiss, e'er he smelt out the Jest. Aback he starts, for he knew well enough, That Women's Lips are smooth, but these were rough. What have I done, quoth he? and rav'd and star'd, Ah me! I've kist a Woman with a Beard. He curst the Hour, and rail'd against the Stars, That he was born to kiss my Lady's ? A Note of Laughter. Tehea, she cry'd, and clapt the Window close, While Absalon with Grief and Anger goes To meditate Revenge; and to requite The foul Affront, he would not sleep that Night. And now with Dust, with Sand, with Straw, with Chips, He scrubs and rubs the Kisses from his Lips, Oft would he say, Alas! O basest Evil! Than met with this Disgrace so damn'd uncivil, I rather had went headlong to the Devil. To kiss a Woman's ? oh! it can't be born! But by my Soul I'll be aveng'd by Morn. Hot Love, the Proverb says, grows quickly cool, And Absalon's no more an Am'rous Fool: For since his Purpose was so fouly crost, He gains his Quiet, tho' his Love is lost: And, cur'd of his Distemper, can defy All whining Coxcombs with a scornful Eye: But for meer Anger, as he pass'd the Street, He wept, as does a School-boy when he's beat. In a soft, doleful Pace at last he came To an old Vulcan, Jarvis was his Name; Who late and early at the Forge turmoyl'd, In hamm'ring Iron Bars, and Plough-shares, toil'd. Hither repair'd, by One or Two a Clock, Poor Absalon, and gave an easy Knock. Who's there that knocks so late, Sir Jarvis cries? “'Tis I, the pensive Absalon replies. “Open the Door.” ‘What Absalon, quoth He, ‘The Parish Clerk?’ Ah! Benedicite. Where hast thou been? some pretty Girl, I wot, Has led you out so late upon the trot. Some merry-meeting on the Wenching score, You know my Meaning,—but I'll say no more. This Absalon another Distaff drew, And had more Tow to spin than Jarvis knew: He minded not a Bean of all he said, For other Things employ'd his careful Head. At last he Silence breaks, Dear Friend, he cries, Lend's that hot Pur, which in the Chimney lies; I have occasion for't, no Questions ask, To bring it back again shall be my Task. ‘With all my Heart, quoth Jarvis, were it Gold, ‘Or splendid Nobles in a Purse untold; ‘With all my Heart, as I'm an honest Smith, ‘I'll lend it Thee; but what wilt do therewith?’ “For that, quoth Absalon, nor care, nor sorrow, “I'll give a good Account of it to Morrow.” Then up the Culter in his Hand he caught, Tripp'd out with silent Pace, and wicked Thought. Red-hot it was, as any burning Cole, With which to John the Carpenter's he stole. There first he cough'd, and, as his usual Wont, Up to the Window came, and tapp'd upon't. ‘Who's there? quoth Alison, Some Midnight Rook, ‘Some Thief, I warrant, with a hanging Look.’ “Ah! God forbid, quoth this dissembling Elf, “'Tis Absalon, my Life! my better Self! “A rich Gold Ring I've to my Darling brought, “By a known Graver exquisitely wrought. “Beside, a Posie, most divinely writ “By a fam'd Poet, and notorious Wit. “My Mother gave it me ('tis wond'rous fine) “She clapp'd it on my Finger, I on thine, “If thou wilt deign the favour of a Kiss—” Now Nicholas by chance rose up to piss, Thinking to better, and improve the Jest, He should salute his Breech, before the rest. With eager Haste, and secret Joy he went, And his Posteriors out at Window sent. Here Absalon, the Wag, with subtle Tone Whispers, “My Love! my Soul! my Alison, “Speak, my sweet Bird, I know not where thou art—” At this the Scholar let a rouzing Fart; So loud the Noise, as frightful was the Stroke, As Thunder, when it splits the sturdy Oak. The Clerk was ready, and with hearty Gust The Red-hot Iron in his Buttocks thrust. Streight off the Skin, like shrivel'd Parchment flew, His Breech as raw as Saint Bartholomew. The Culter had so fing'd his Hinder Part, He thought he should have dy'd for very Smart. In a mad Fit about the Room he ran, Help, Water, Water, for a dying Man. The Carpenter, as one beside his Wits, Starts at the dreadful Sound, and up he gets. The Name of Water rouz'd him from his Sleep, He rubb'd his Eye-lids, and began to peep. Alas! thought he, now comes the fatal Hour, And from the Clouds does Noah's Deluge pour. Up then he sits, and without more Ado He takes his Ax, and smites the Cord in two. Down goes the Bread, and Ale, and Cheese, and All, And John himself had a confounded Fall. Dropp'd from the Roof upon the Floor; astoun'd He lies, as dead, and swims upon dry Ground. Then Nicholas, to play the Counterfeit, With Alison, cries Murder in the Street. In came the Neighbours pouring like the Tide, To know the reason why was Murder cry'd. There they beheld poor John, a gasping Man, Shut were his Eyes, his Face was pale and wan. Batter'd his Sides, and broken was his Arm, But stand it out he must to his own Harm. For when he aim'd to speak in his Defence, They bore him down, and baffled all his Sense. They told the People, that the Man was wood, And dreamt of nothing else but Noah's Flood. His heated Fancy of this Deluge rung, That to the Roof three Kneading-Troughs he hung, With which in Danger he design'd to swim, And we, forsooth, must carry on the Whim: He begg'd, and pray'd, and so we humour'd him. At hearing this, the sneering Neighbours gave An universal Shout, and hideous Laugh. Now on the Roof, and now on John they gape, And all his Earnest turn into a Jape. He swore against the Scholar and his Wife, And never look'd so foolish in his Life. Whate're he speaks, the People never mind, His Oaths are nothing, and his Words are Wind. Thus all consent to scoff each serious Word, And John remain'd a Cuckold on Record. Thus Doors of Brass, and Bars of Steel are vain, And watchful Jealousy, and carking Pain Are fruitless all, when a good-natur'd Spouse Designs Preferment for her Husband's Brows. Thus Alison her Cuckold does defy, And Absalon has kiss'd her-nether Eye; While Nicholas is scalded in the Breech, My Tale is done, God save us all, and each. End of the Miller's TALE. PROLOGUE TO THE REVE's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. The Miller ceas'd, exulting at the Close, And, as He ceas'd, a gen'ral Laugh arose; For hum'rous was the Tale, tho' low the Stile, Ev'n They, that blush'd to laugh, agreed to smile. Each, various, variously discuss'd the Case; The Scholar's Payment, and the Clerk's Disgrace! The frisky Wife's Elopement in the Dark, And the dull Husband, lodg'd in Noah's Ark! Not One, but peevish Oswolde, seem'd to grieve, Of Craft, a Carpenter, as well as Reve. Hence, many a Fault he found, and more he made; The Tale was a Reflection on the Trade!— So lash the lewdest Varlet of the Gown, You raise the Spleen of ev'ry Priest in Town. “For Wit, said He, was Ribaldry to pass, “Full on the Miller cou'd I turn the Glass. “But Old I am! Sport suits but ill with Age! “And He too verges on his latter Stage. “Past is the Spring that Heav'n to Me assign'd! “He thinks a second Crop remains behind. “Poor Forage at the Best! (I scorn all Art,—) “Nor will it keep the Steed in Flesh, or Heart. “This Top of Snow my Wintry State declares, “My Spirits fail me faster than my Hairs. “Yet some in Age affect the Wanton Play, “As if improv'd, like Medlars, by Decay; “(The Fruit, that, till it rots, is never ripe!) “But, ah! so long we dance, as we can pipe! “Woman indeed, like Leeks, may last a-bed; “Green at the Tail, tho' hoary at the Head. “But for the Man that toils with Limbs declin'd, “What shows he but a teazing Itch of Mind? “Hands cease to move, and Feet forget to walk, “But not the Heart to wish, or Tongue to talk; “With Ashes loaded still survives Desire, “A Spark of What he was, a Mark of Fire! “Decrepid Age, you may as well defy, “Or not to fret, or hoard, or vaunt, or lye, “As not to covet what it priz'd in Youth; “Last falls, of all the Teeth, the Coltish Tooth! “Full many a Year (for so my Thread was spun) “Has ended, since my Tap of Life begun. “Death, present at my Birth, (that Early Foe!) “Drew forth the Cock, and bade the Current flow. “Fast has it ran, but will no longer run, “I feel it, almost empty is the Tun! “The Liquor, be it us'd, or be it spilt, “Is gone; the Cask stands high upon the Tilt! “When sinks the Body to so low a State, “Ill may the silly Tongue pretend to prate; “The Wish to please will scarce the Pow'r restore; “That Fancy is meer Dotage, and no more.

THE REVE's TALE. By Mr. BETTERTON. At Thrompington, not far from Cambridge, stood Across a pleasant Stream, a Bridge of Wood; Near it a Mill, in low and plashy Ground, Where Corn for all the neighb'ring Parts was ground. The sturdy Miller, with his powder'd Locks, Proud as a Peacock, subtile as a Fox, Could pipe, and fish, and wrestle, throw a Net, Turn drinking Cups, and teach young Dogs to set; Brawny, big-bon'd, strong made was ev'ry Limb, But few durst venture to contend with him. A Dagger hanging at his Belt he had, Made of an antient Sword's well-temper'd Blade; He wore a Sheffield Whittle in his Hose; Broad was his Face, and very flat his Nose; Bald as an Ape behind was this Man's Crown; No one could better beat a Market down: But Millers will be Thieves; he us'd to steal, Slyly and artfully, much Corn and Meal. This Miller's Wife came of a better Race, The Parson's Daughter of the Town she was: Her Portion small, her Education high, She had her Breeding in a Nunnery. ‘Whoe'er he marry'd (Simkin boldly said) ‘Should be a Maid well-born, and nicely bred. You'd laugh to see him in his best Array, Strutting before her on a Holy Day. If any boldly durst accost his Wife, He drew his Dagger, or his Sheffield Knife. 'Tis dang'rous to provoke a jealous Fool; She manag'd cunningly her stubborn Tool. To all beneath her, insolently high, Walk'd like a Duck, and chatter'd like a Pye: Proud of her Breeding, froward, full of Scorn, As if she were of Noble Parents born; With other Virtues of the same Degree, All learn'd in that choice School, the Nunnery. Their Daughter was just twenty, coarse and bold; A Boy too in the Cradle, six Months old. Thick, short, and brawny this plump Damsel was, Her Nose was flat, her Eyes were grey as Glass; Her Haunches broad, with Breasts up to her Chin; Fair was her Hair, but tawny was her Skin, A mighty Trade this lusty Miller drove, All for Convenience came, not one for Love. Much Grist from Cambridge to his Lot did fall, And all the Corn they us'd at Scholars-hall. Their Manciple fell dangerously ill; Bread must be had, their Grist went to the Mill: This Simkin moderately stole before, Their Steward sick, he robb'd them ten times more. Their Bread fell short; the Warden storm'd; with Skill Examin'd those who brought it from the Mill. The Miller to a strict Account they call: He impudently swears he gave them all. Two poor young Scholars, hungry, much distress'd, (Who thought themselves more wise than all the rest) Intreat the Warden, the next Corn he sent, To trust it to their prudent Management: Both would attend him with such Care and Art, Defy him then to steal the smallest Part. At last the Warden grants what they desire, All is got ready as these Two require. Bold Men, tho' disappointed, ne'er are sham'd; One was call'd Allen, t'other John was nam'd. Both Northern Men, both in one Town were born, They mount, and lead the Horse that bears the Corn. ‘Be careful, Allen cries, and do not stray.’ “Fear nothing, he replies, I know the Way.” Thus they jog on, and on the Road contrive To catch the Thief; till at the Mill they 'rive. “Ho Sim, says John, what ho, the Miller there? ‘Who calls? cries Simkin, tell me who you are?’ “How fares your comely Daughter and your Wife? ‘What, John and Allen? welcome by my Life; The Miller said, ‘What Wind has brought you hither?’ “That which makes old Wives trudge, brought us together. “Who keeps no Man, must his own Servant be; “Our Manciple is very sick, and we “Are with the Corn from our good Warden come, “To see it ground, and bring it safely home: “Dispatch it, Sim, with all the Haste you may.” ‘It shall be done (he says) without Delay. ‘What will you do while I have this in Hand?’ “Says John, just at the Hopper will I stand, “(In my whole Life I never saw Grist ground,) “And mark the Clack how justly it will sound.” ‘Aha! Chum John, cries Allen, will you so? ‘Then will I watch how it steals out below.’ Sim, at their Plot, maliciously did smile; None could, they thought, such learned Clerks beguile. He meant to cast a Mist before their Eye, In spite of all their fine Philosophy, Neither should find where he convey'd the Meal; The narrower they watch'd, the more he'd steal. These Scholars for their Flour, shall have the Bran; The learned'st Clerk is not the wisest Man: Then out he steals, and finds, where, by the Head, Their Horse hung fasten'd underneath a Shed: He slips the Bridle o'er his Neck; the Steed Makes to the Fens, where Maies and Fillies feed. Unmiss'd comes Sim, finds John fix'd at his Post, And Allen diligent, no Meal was lost: ‘Now do me Justice, Friends, he says, you can ‘Convince your Warden I'm an honest Man.’ Now the great Work is done, their Corn is ground, The Grist is sack'd, and every Sack well bound: John runs to fetch the Horse; aloud he cries, “Come hither Allen;” Allen to him flies. “O Friend, we are undone!”—‘What mean you, John?’ “Look there's the Bridle, but our Horse is gone!” ‘Gone! whither? says he’—“Nay, Heav'n knows, not I’— Out bolts Sim's Wife, and (with a ready Lye) She cries, “I saw him toss his Head, and play, “Then slip the loosen'd Reins, and trot away. ‘Which Way? they both demand—“With wanton Bounds, “I saw him scamp'ring tow'rd yon fenny Grounds: “Wild Mares and Colts in those low Marshes feed.” Away the Scholars run with utmost Speed, Forget their former cautious Husbandry; Their Sack does at the Miller's Mercy lie. He half a Bushel of their Flour does take, Then bids his Wife secure it in a Cake. ‘I'll send these empty Boys again to School, ‘To plot and study who's the greater Fool: ‘Look where the learned Blockheads make their Way, ‘Let us be merry, while those Children play.’ These silly Scholars ran from Place to Place; Now here, now there, unequal was the Chace. They call him by his Name, whistle and cry, Ho Ball! but Ball is pleas'd with Liberty. At Night into a narrow Place they brought him, Drove him into a Ditch, and there they caught him. Weary and wet, as Cattle in the Rain, Allen, and simple John, come back again. “Alas! cries John, wou'd I had ne'er been born! “When we return, we shall be laugh'd to Scorn. “Call'd by the Fellows, and our Warden Fools: “Our Grist is stol'n, and we the Miller's Tools.” Thus John complains: Allen without Remorse Goes to the Barn, and in he turns the Horse. Both cold and hungry, wet and daub'd with Mire; They find the Miller sitting at his Fire; “We can't return, they say, before 'tis Light; “So beg for Lodging in your Mill to-night.” Simkin replies, ‘Welcome with all my Heart, ‘I'll find you out the most convenient Part. ‘My House is straight, but you are learned Men; ‘You can by Dint of Argument maintain, ‘That twenty Yards a Mile in Breadth comprise: ‘Now show your Art, and make a Miller Wise.’ “You're merry, Friend; but wet and clammy Earth, “Hunger and Cold, provoke few Men to Mirth. “A Man complies with necessary Things, “Content with what he finds, or what he brings. “'Tis Meat and Drink we earnestly desire; “To warm and dry us with a better Fire. “Look, we have Coin to pay what you demand! “We ne'er catch Falcons with an empty Hand.” Sim sends his Daughter to a neighb'ring House For good strong Ale, and roasts a well-fed Goose. Tho' homely was his Room, it was not small; They had no other, it must serve them all. The Daughter makes for these two Youths a Bed, Lays on clean Sheets, with Blankets fairly spred. Twelve Foot beyond, in the remotest Place, There stood another for their Daughter Grace. The Supper does with sprightly Mirth abound, Each has his Jest, the nappy Ale goes round; Nor the squab Daughter, nor the Wife were nice, Each Health the Youths began, Sim pledg'd it twice. The heady Liquor stupefies their Care, But Midnight past, they all to Rest repair. The Miller yawn'd, his Eyes began to close; The Wife got Sim to Bed, he had his Dose. She follow'd him; but she was gay and light, Her Whistle had been wetted too that Night; She plac'd the Child in Cradle by her Side, To give it Suck, or rock it if it cry'd. The Daughter too, when once the Ale was gone, Retir'd to Bed; so Allen did, and John. Sleep on the most did instantly prevail; The Miller's lusty Dose of potent Ale Made him like any Stone-horse snort and snore, The Treble was behind, the Base before: The Wife's Horse-tenor vacant Parts did fill, The Daughter bore her Part with wond'rous Skill, They might be heard a Furlong from the Mill. When this melodious Consort first began, Young Allen tumbling, pushes his Friend John: ‘It is impossible to sleep, he says, ‘I'll up and dance, while this choice Musick plays.’ He cries, “What means my Brother?”—Allen said, ‘I mean to steal into the Daughter's Bed. ‘'Tis said, the Man who in one Point is griev'd, ‘Ought in another Point to be reliev'd. ‘Our Corn is stol'n, and we like Fools are caught, ‘The Daughter shall repay the Father's Fault.’— “O Allen, he replies, think while you can, “'Fore Heav'n the Miller is a dang'rous Man! “Should he discover you, I would be loth “The Thief should wreak his Vengeance on us both.” ‘I fear him not, says Allen, I am young; ‘Tho' he's well-set, my Sinews are as strong.’ Then up he gets; now Friend good Luck (he said) The Daughter's Trumpet led him to her Bed: Half stupefy'd with Ale, she sprawling lay; He softly creeping in, soon hit his Way; Soon put all knotty Questions out of doubt, Stopping her Mouth, prevented crying out. John grumbling lay, while Allen's Place was void, “Am I then idle, while my Friend's employ'd? “He can revenge himself for all his Harms, “He has the Miller's Daughter in his Arms, “While I lie spiritless, benumb'd and cold; “I shall be jear'd to Death, when this is told— “They nothing can perform, who ne'er begin; “Faint Heart, they say, did ne'er fair Lady win.” Then up he rose, and softly groaping round, He found the Cradle standing on the Ground, Close by the Miller's Bed; this unespy'd He took, and set it by his own Bed-side. The Miller's Wife had now more Grists to grind, (Some Mills by Water move, and some by Wind) The proper Utensil not plac'd at Hand, She rose, by pure Necessity constrain'd. That grand Affair dispatch'd, and feeling round Her Husband's Bed, no Cradle could be found. “Where am I? Benedicite, she said! “This is undoubtedly the Scholars Bed.” Then turning t'other Way, her Hand did light Full on the Cradle.—“Now, she cry'd, I'm right.” Lifting the Clothes, into the Bed she leap'd, And close to John full harmlesly she crept: In a short time he takes her in his Arms, And kindly treats her with unusual Charms. She thought (strange Fancies working in her Mind) Some Saint had made her Husband over-kind. Propitious Stars this Fortune did bestow On Both, till the third Cock began to crow. Now Allen fancy'd Light would soon appear, He kiss'd the Wench, and said, ‘My Grace! my Dear! ‘Thou kindest of thy Sex, the Day comes on, ‘And we must part’—“Alas, will you be gone, “She said, and leave poor harmless me alone?”— ‘If I stay longer, we are both undone; ‘For should your Father wake, and find me here, ‘What will become of me and you, my Dear?’ “That dreadful Thought (she cries) distracts my Heart, “Too soon you won me, and too soon we part.” Then clinging round his Neck, with weeping Eyes, She says, “Remember me!” ‘Allen replies, ‘I'll quickly find Occasion to return; ‘You shall not long for Allen's Absence mourn.’ “Farewel, she cries! But, Dearest, one Word more; “You'll find upon a Sack behind the Door “A Cake, and under it a Bag of Meal; “The Flour my Father and my self did steal “Out of your Sack; but take it, 'tis your own; “Be careful, Love,—not a Word more, be gone.” Now Allen softly feeling for his Bed, By Chance his Hand laid on the Cradle-head. And shrinking from it, said (with no small Fear) ‘That Rogue the Miller and his Wife lie there.’ Turning, he finds Sim's Palate, in he crept; ‘I'm right, he says, dull John all Night has slept. Then shaking him ‘Wake, Swineherd, Allen cries, ‘I've joyful News.’—“What?” grumbling Sim replies. ‘I am the luckiest Rogue—by this no Light, ‘I have had full Employment all the Night: ‘The Daughter kindly paid her Father's Score, ‘All Night I have embrac'd her.’—“O the Whore! “O thou false Traytor, Clerk! thou hast defil'd “Our honest Family, deflow'r'd our Child! “Thy Life shall answer it.”—With that he caught At Allen's Throat: young Allen stoutly fought. Both give and take, returning Blows with Blows; But Allen struck the Miller on the Nose With all his Force; out flies the streaming Gore, And down it runs: They tumble on the Floor: Then up they get, lab'ring with equal Strife: Sim stumbled backwards quite across his Wife. She fast asleep, none of this Scuffle heard; Wak'd by his Fall, and heartily afeard: “Help, Holy Cross of Broholme! (O I faint!) “Help my good Angel! help my Patron Saint! “The Fiend lies on me like a Load of Lead! “Remove this Dev'l, this Night-mare, or I'm dead!” Then up starts John, and turns 'em from the Wife, Hunts for a Cudgel to conclude the Strife. Up gets the Miller, Allen grasps him close, Both play at hard-head, struggling to get loose. Out steps the Wife, well knowing where there stood. In a By-corner, a tough Piece of Wood; On this she seiz'd, and by a glimm'ring Light Which enter'd at a Chink, saw something white: But, by a foul Mistake, 'twas her ill Hap To take his bald Pate for the Scholar's Cap. She lifts the Staff, it fell on his bare Crown, Strong was the Blow, she knock'd her Husband down. ‘O, I am slain! the Miller loudly cry'd; “Live to be hang'd, thou Thief,” Allen reply'd. Away they go, first take their Meal and Cake, Then lay the Grist upon their Horse's Back. To Scholars-hall they march, for now 'twas Light, Pleas'd with the strange Adventures of the Night. The Wife the Scholars curses, binds his Head, Then lifts him up, and lays him on the Bed. ‘O Wife, says Sim, our Daughter is defil'd! ‘That Villain Allen has debauch'd our Child! ‘Mistaking me for John, he told me all; ‘Ten thousand Furies plague that Scholars-hall. “O false abusive Knave! (the Wife reply'd) “In ev'ry Word the Villain spake, he ly'd. “I wak'd, and heard our harmless Child complain, “And rose, to know the Cause, and ease her Pain. “I found her torn with Gripes, a Dram I brought, “And made her take a comfortable Draught. “Then lay down by her, chaf'd her swelling Breast, “And lull'd her in these very Arms to Rest. “All was Contrivance, Malice all and Spite; “I have not parted from her all this Night.” Then is she innocent? “Ay, by my Life, “As pure and spotless—as thy Bosom Wife.” I'm satisfy'd, says Sim. O that damn'd Hall! I'll do the best I can to starve them all. And thus the Miller of his Fear is eas'd, The Mother and the Daughter both well-pleas'd. End of the First Volume.</field>

End of the Prologue. GAMELYN: OR, The COOK's TALE. By Mr. BOYSE. How constant Valour triumphs o'er its Foes, And the firm Mind beneath Oppression grows, I sing—Ye whom heroic Deeds delight, Attend the Tale, and mark what I recite. 'Twas in victorious Edward's happy Days, When Britain's Glory shed distinguish'd Rays! Where thro' the verdant Groves and level Meads, His silver Course the gentle Medway leads; Too feeble now for Arms,—his Helm unbrac'd, His calm Retreat a worthy Knight had plac'd: In youthful Years no Stranger he to Fame, Sir John of Bondis was the Warrior's Name; From vanquish'd Gaul, and Cressy's sanguine Field, He bore new Honours o'er his trophy'd Shield: But Time had cool'd the Ardours in his Breast, And Action taught him all the Worth of Rest; Yet often at the hospitable Board, By Cheerfulness maintain'd, with Plenty stor'd, To speak of former Toils he took Delight, To paint the Combat, and renew the Fight! Close by the winding Stream his Castle stood, It's Turrets glitter'd o'er the glassy Flood; Here liv'd the honour'd Knight in decent State, Peace watch'd the Walls, &amp; Welcome kept the Gate. His Consort lost, a widowed Life he led, Three manly Sons had crown'd his nuptial Bed; The eldest far unlike the generous Knight, A rough, suspicious, base, uncourteous Wight: To all ungentle, to his Father most, His Age he slighted, and his Love he lost: The younger two were of a milder Kind, And bore their Sire's Impression on the Mind. Long the respected Knight enjoy'd Repose, Till Life's low Shade projected to a Close; Soft tho' the Fall, and gentle the Decay, Death is a Struggle still in Nature's Way; But Arms had so familiariz'd his Face, He met his Terror with a decent Grace; Careful his House's Welfare to provide, The Measure of his fair Estates he ey'd; Study'd the separate Share to each should fall, And found his Wealth sufficient for them all. His Servants call'd; his last Request he draws, Summons his Friends, judicious in the Laws; His Case recites, how low near Death he lies, Begs them to haste, and aid his last Devise; With friendly Counsel his Intent supply, And leave Affairs well order'd e'er he die. Soon as the Tydings spread, the mournful Train Crowd to the Hall, and sighing view the Scene. Around his Bed the sad Attendance stands, Comforts his Griefs, and waits his last Commands; His Brow still placid, tho' his Accent weak, He lifts his trembling Hand, and tries to speak. “I feel, my Friends, the universal Doom, “My Course is ended, and my Hour is come. “The destin'd Hour, which none are giv'n to pass, “Time shakes the ebbing Sands, and turns my glass. (With that he sigh'd, his rev'rend Head he shook, Tears melted from the Audience as he spoke) They bid him cheer, nor be so deep dismay'd, Sick as he was, yet Heav'n might send him Aid; Raise Health from Fate, from Pain recover Ease, And lengthen Life for yet succeeding Days. “I know it well, the dying Knight reply'd, “Heaven's Will is fix'd, and must not be deny'd; “But Age from me forbids a Hope so vain, “Nor wish I Life at the Expence of Pain. “One Thought alone does all my Cares encrease “On Terms secure to found my Children's Peace; “You then, my Friends, whose sage Discretion knows, “Suits to prevent, and Interests to compose, “Amongst my Sons a fair Division make, “My Wealth, my Fortune to your Wisdom take; “For Heav'ns high Sake, take care of partial wrong, “Nor slight my Gamelyn because he's young. “Fond in my Heart he claims an equal Share, “My just Affection points him equal Heir; “Wretched the Brothers, who on one depend; “Pow'r breaks the Ties of Kindred and of Friend. “And oft the younger Martlet's forc'd to roam, “To search that Rest he fails to find at home. So ends the Knight, and in the Sages go, Justice oft yields when Interest is the Foe. A rising Sun the general Worship draws, And well the Proverb speaks, New Lords new Laws; Fear bid them not the wayward Squire provoke, His Temper known they dread his future Stroke; Love strikes the Heart, as Harmony the Ear, The Taste alone that's delicate can hear; But Tyrant Terror gives a stronger Sound, And spreads an universal Panick round; So half by Interest sway'd, and half by Fright, They cross the honest Purpose of the Knight; The large Succession to the first design, To Otto next a small Remain assign, And leave young Gamelyn without a Care, To wait his Fortune from the potent Heir, Who had, if he deserv'd, enough to spare. Deciding thus, back to the Knight they speed, Who waited what their Judgment had decreed; Inform him, thay had acted his Commands, And in the wisest Way dispos'd his Lands. Vex'd as he heard, he often shook his Head, And much displeas'd—at last broke out and said. “Is this the Faith my confidence attends? “And is it thus ye act the Part of Friends? “By good Saint Martyn, but ye deal it fine! “Yet do I live,—and still my Land is mine. “Then witness Neighbours to my latest Will, “Thus I ordain, so Heav'n my wish fulfil! “Five Ploughs of Land my eldest I assign, “The antient Seat of our paternal Line! “To Otto I bequeath as many more, “My Toils have added to our native Store: “Of all my other Lands and Chattels fair, “Of all my Steeds be Gamelyn the Heir! “Impartial Justice gives this Law to bind, “And Kent was ever true to Gavel-kind. “This is my only Will, my last Command; “Attest it Heav'n! and let no other stand! The Knight, his last Intentions thus exprest, Resign'd attended hastening Death's Arrest. Soon came the Stroke, the Spirit passed away, And the cold Warrior stiffen'd into Clay! Now in his Tomb with decent Honours laid, And all the Rites of due Interment paid; Sir John, the empty Image of his Name, A stranger to his Virtues, or his Fame! His Fathers solemn Charge forgetful breaks, With lawless grasp the wide Succession takes. Then Gamelyn first divested of his Right, Bore all the Vengeance of Fraternal Spite. The Youth before who only Pleasure knew, Who rose the Darling of a Father's View, The sad Reverse of former Ease beheld, With hardships practis'd, and with Frowns repeld; Fed with the menial Train, and cloth'd yet worse, And all he got, attended with a Curse. Usage at last with ample Interest paid, On the unnatr'al Giver's churlish Head! Yet spite of all, young Gamelyn's gentle Art Gain'd over every Vassal to his Part; Such open Goodness dwelt around his Face, His Actions bore such Marks of manly Grace! They griev'd in Sloth to see such Virtue lost, Each strove with eager Zeal to serve him most; By each ador'd—but when the Knight was near, They durst not show their Sentiments for Fear. It chanc'd one Morn, involv'd in studious Mood, Within the Spacious Court the Stripling stood: He strok'd his Chin, whose early down began, To rise and tell him, what became a Man; His Eyes he threw along the Wood-land Coast, And sigh'd to think the Heritage he lost: His Lands he saw untill'd, his Parks unpal'd, His Game was wasted, and his Woods were fell'd: No Steed to call his own,—a generous Shame Rose in his Breast and mounted to a Flame! “Had he been cheated of his Right so long? “And was he tamely still to bear the Wrong? “Honour reproach'd him for a Thought so low, “And threatning Justice set upon his Brow!” Just from the Field return'd his Brother in, With haughty Aspect, and assuming Mien; “Go Idler! haste, he cry'd, and bring us Word, “What Cheer to Day,—or have they spread the Board? “Brother, the Youth replies, walk in and look. “I neither am thy Butler, nor thy Cook!” “What mutter'st thou? the Knight in Fury cry'd, “Whence hast thou catch'd this Spark of upstart Pride? “Thou never durst a Speech like this before, “Go know thy self, and dread the Hand of Pow'r!” “Brother, said Gamelyn, my Answer take, “Myself I know, and from that Knowledge speak; “But honest Minds a servile Yoke disdain, “And honest Tongues will call Oppression mean! “Think'st thou those Lands that lye before my View, “My Birth-right seiz'd, unjustly seiz'd by you, “Yon Fields unfallow'd, and yon Houses void, “My Deer unharbour'd from those Woods destroy'd; “My Coursers in your slavish Toil employ'd, “Think'st thou that those for no Resentment call? “Or think, if just, where that should greatly fall? “All that my Father left is gone to wreck, “So take my Curse, and wear it on thy Back. At this Reproach all Patience left the Knight, His Eye-balls kindled, and his Cheeks grew white. “Hence Vagabond, he cries, and thank my Love, “Thy Rashness does no worse Correction prove; “What pratest thou of Lands, and Houses thine? “Mine the Possession is,—the Right is mine: “Furnish'd with simple Food and plain Attire, “Rest well content,—What more canst thou desire? To whom the Youth “False Knight, be thine: the Shame, “Thou Wretch unworthy of a Brother's Name; “A Vagabond!—Go boast thee of the Style, “Whose social Titles sordid Thoughts defile: “If thy Injustice has my Fall pursu'd, “Am I from thence an Alien to thy Blood? “To the same Source we owe our vital Fire, “A Lady bore us, and a Knight our Sire! “Usurper cease! thy lawless Claim resign! “Give me, what Love paternal destin'd mine, “All future Kindred willing I forego, “All Bands disclaim,—I scorn to be thy Foe. Then rag'd, Sir John, but half his Rage suppress'd! Fear stopp'd his Voice, and chill'd his conscious Breast, Trembling his scatter'd Servants round he calls; The wish'd Assistance issues from the Walls: With that returning, all his Wrath returns; And so supplied, his borrow'd Courage burns, “Go bind, he cries, Go bind this shallow Boy, “Immur'd his Tongue may learn a just Employ; “So due Chastisement quickly mends the Young, “So shall this Sterling chant another Song! Then Gamelyn thus,—“Thou Tyrant! base of Heart! Who can reply to thy degenerate Part? “What, of a Stripling is a Knight afraid? “But dastard Minds grow insolent with Aid; “In Innocence, unarm'd, secure I stand, “And brave the coward Malice of thy Hand; “Provoke the Fight, thy empty Boastings throw, “Cursed be he, that keeps thee from my Blow!” At this the Caitiff shrunk with new Alarms, And call'd the rude Militia out to Arms; The ready Weapons, Pitchforks, Poles afford, Sneering they march to save their fearful Lord; The manly Youth well pleas'd the Storm survey'd, On a strong Staff his Hands he quickly laid; Then like a prudent General look'd around, Stept to a Wall, and seiz'd th' advantage Ground; He mark'd the aukward Rout as on they press'd, Affection most detain'd, and Fear the rest; Encourag'd thus he made a forward Pace, And saw Confusion rise in every Face! Some gentle Strokes apply'd with skillful Hand, Forc'd all the rude Battalion to disband; To Stables some, and some to Barns retreat, Others more hasty sought the Postern Gate; But safest in the Van the General fled, And in a Hay-loft screen'd his valiant Head: When Gamelyn, now who saw the Field his own, Address'd the Fugitive in scornful Tone! “And is it thus, good Knight, you value Fame? “Thus is it you assert your Father's Name? “For Flight so ready, yet so prone to Strife, “Nor less the Hopes of your inglorious Life! (At this as round he look'd the Knight he spy'd Who at a narrow Chink his Face apply'd) “Bondis come down, and fetch thy mighty Blade! “Art thou a Knight, and dar'st thou be afraid? “A Novice I, yet would I fain discern, “What thou can'st practise, or what I may learn. “By good Saint Richard, said th' astonish'd Knight, “I did not guess you were so keen at Fight; “But while you brandish that accursed Stake, “Nor will I venture down, nor Parlance make; “Thy Weapon quit, I give the Contest o'er, “And here I vow to injure thee no more! “How soon I ween you change, reply'd the Squire, “Aggressor first, you first the Peace require; “Thanks to my Staff that kept your Clowns away, “Else might my Bones have suffer'd from the Play. “No, Gamelyn dear, reply'd the treacherous Knight, “By good Saint Richard, you mistook me quite; “Your mounting Spirits took too soon th' Alarm, “Be witness Heav'n, I never meant you Harm! “To try your early Worth was my Design, “Who durst so young th' unequal Combat join; “Now known with Joy thy Courage I embrace, “And own thee worthy of our noble Race! With a Confession pleas'd he thought sincere, The honest Youth resum'd his wonted Air; “Descend, Sir Knight, securely, safe descend, “Here cease our Quarrel, all Divisions end! “Grant me one sole Request, my humble Boon, “And good Agreement shall unite us soon. Down came the Knight, but trembling look'd around, And saw the dreaded Weapon on the Ground; But Smiles conceal'd the Rancour of his Breast, “Brother, says he, impart your fair Request; “If I deny you ought, your Wishes claim, “Your's be the Credit, and be mine the Shame! I take your Word, the Youth sincere replies, Justice I ask, in you, the Justice lies; Decline the stronger Plea of wresting Pow'r, My Father's Heritage entire restore; So shall thy Honour make its Promise good, So shall we live in Peace,—as Brothers shou'd. “Agreed, resum'd Sir John and gave his Hand, “Thy Lands be thine, I grant thy full Demand! “When e'er thy Youth the Date of Manhood gains “I yeild thee all, our Father's Will ordains; “If further Favours then thy Wishes crave, “As freely share the fair Demains I have; “Till then thy Fields manur'd shall feel my care, “They Parks inclos'd, thy Houses find Repair”. So spoke the Traitor with dissembling Art, What to perform was never in his Heart; With secret Fraud his wicked Flattry fraught, And dark Revenge lay lurking in his Thought. Not Gamelyn so, his Bosom knew no Guile, He kiss'd his Judas Brother with a Smile; Where feigned Kindness spoke him well content, So reconcil'd together in they went. The Story spread soon grew the Village Theme And the fond Neighbours dwelt on Gamelyn's Name; But he regardless pass'd the Action by, For Clowns were not the Foes he wish'd to try; Oft thro' the Hall as silently he pass'd, And on the trophy'd Walls Attention cast; His Father's Arms, the Banner high display'd, The crested Helmet, and the massy Blade! A Sigh the Biass of his Soul confess'd, And all the Warrior glow'd within his Breast; The Rage of Battle glitter'd in his Sight, His Heart beat high, and panted for the Fight! Nor vain his Hope to prove the martial Flame, Nor wish'd he long, till kind Occasion came; The Swains who to the Castle held Resort, The Tidings brought and swell'd the fond Report; How near the Kentish Wild for Wrestlers fam'd, That Day a famous Contest was proclaim'd, Where a huge Ram of more than common Size, And Ring of Gold were set the Victor's Prize; They tell from all around what Numbers speed, How many Rivals go to seek the Meed; But chief a Flemish Champion's Praise they sound, Whose Vigour in repeated Trials found, Whose sinew'd Limbs experienc'd Action show, And make Contenders dread so fierce a Foe! Enough was said, nor needed Gamelyn more, To raise that Passion glow'd so warm before; With eager Ears he drinks the pleasing Tale, Resolv'd to try his Fortune on the Dale. Immediate to his Brother's Sight he press'd, And thus he vents th' Impatience in his Breast; “A Journey must I speed, Sir John, this Night, “A Horse I want, a Courser fleet and light; “Of all thy numerous Steeds I seek but one, “Nor wave my Suit, I languish to be gone; “To Minds, that early Thirst of Honour sways, “Time backward rolls, and Moments seem Delays. To whom the artful Knight with feigning Voice. “My Steeds are at thy Will, and wait thy Choice; “But tell me whence Requests so earnest flow, “And whither would my gentle Brother go? “In Words as brief, the smiling Youth reply'd, “A Wrestling near is kept, and there I ride; “Thither in Crowds th' assembling Youth convene, “I mean to try the Hazard of the Green; “Success, perhaps, may crown my first Essay, “My Arm, perhaps, may bear the Prize away; “Go, said the Knight, right may your Wishes fall, “And your first Spoils adorn our ancient Hall! The Order giv'n,—the lively Youth descends, Where at the Gate the harnest Steed attends; Fast on his Feet the shining Spurs he makes, Light in his Hand, a slender Wand he shakes! A conscious Pleasure sparkles in his Eye; He look'd like Hermes, just prepar'd to fly! The Courser mounts, and agile as the Wind, Soon leaves the lessening Tow'rs obscur'd behind; A single Servant scarce his Flight can trace, And reach'd him late, upon the destin'd Place. The jealous Brother pleas'd his parting view'd, And with dark Envy his Design pursu'd; “Go, shallow Boy, he mutter'd, tempt thy Fate, “And find a Period equal to my Hate; “Disgrac'd and trampled by some Foot obscene, “Perish thy breathless Carcase on the Plain. Then to the Hall return'd in Discontent, Yet oft look'd back, and secret Curses sent. So thought the Wretch,—but Heav'n refus'd the Pray'r, And all his impious Vows were lost in Air. But distant now, a-cross the heathy Waste, The little Hero to the Contest past; And now the smoaking Village rose to view, And now he nearer heard the shouting Crew! Yet more distinct appears the opening Scene, The spacious Circle and the crowded Green. Nimbly he whirls the panting Courser round, Springs from the Seat, and treads the envied Ground. Attentive round him as he newly gaz'd, A neighb'ring Object all his Pity rais'd; An aged Yeoman, decent was his Dress, Whose strong Emotion deepest Sighs express; Fast o'er his Cheeks the briny Currents spread, While to the Ground he bent his mournful Head; Fix'd in a Lethargy of Grief he stands, Oft lifts his weeping Eyes, and wrings his Hands; Compassion glow'd in Gamelyn's gentle Mind, The venerable Man's Distress to find; “Forgive, he said, good Man, whose silver Hairs, “Should claim Exemption from such piercing Cares, “Forgive the friendly Motive guides my Tongue, “To aid your Anguish, or redress your Wrong; “For this I ask, nor then refuse to tell, “What speechless Griefs thy warring Bosom swell? “Cloud o'er the Brows, and round thy Visage roll, “And speak the Tempest rising in thy Soul? To whom the Farmer thus in broken Strain, “Vain is thy Help, kind Youth, thy Pity vain! “No Hand can sooth the Sorrows I endure, “Nor Time can mitigate, nor Comfort cure: “Canst thou restore the Dead? The Storm asswage? “Or bind the Pinions of revolving Age? “Then might I hope from thee to find Relief, “Then might one Beam of Ease allay my Grief! “But Nature sinks beneath the fatal Blow, “And future Life is but imbitter'd Woe! “Two Sons I had, the Honour of the Plain, “Two Sons deserving of the Name of Men, “Two Sons this happy Morning hail'd me gay, “Dress'd in the lusty Prime of youthful May! “Who now, ere Noon united press the Strand, “Slain by th' accursed Fleming's deadly Hand; “Detested Terror! could my Eyes but see, “Their Tears repaid in Vengeance due to thee! “Oh! would some Arm well practis'd to the Toil, “Stretch thee all pale and fractur'd on the Soil! “The destin'd Hero should my Wealth receive, “And my bald Head contented reach the Grave. He spoke,—and faint as Gamelyn's Form he ey'd, Admir'd his Mein, while thus the Youth reply'd, “If Wrongs like thine a just Relief engage, “I take thy Cause, my Honour be thy Gage. “Justice herself shall lend her fav'ring Scale, “And bid my Purpose for thy sake prevail! “But while my Man prepares me for the Field, “My Horse to thee committed, safe I yield; “Then mean I bold this Champion to defy, “And right thy Cause, or in the Quarrel die. “A thousand Blessings crown thy generous Heart “The Yeoman said, Brave Youth, whoe'er thou art. “Whose Soul by noble Emulation fir'd, “By Worth incited, or by Heaven inspir'd, “For my sad Loss such kind Concern canst show, “And dare to grapple with so fierce a Foe: “Thy Steed to me, a willing Charge assign, “To aid you for the Field the care be mine. “Revenge alone can stop my bleeding Eyes; “Yours be the Glory, and be yours the Prize. The Youth they strip, his snowy Limbs unfold, Whose tender Arms unwonted Vigour hold; The chesnut Ringlets fall his Neck a-down, His Neck that gave new Lustre to their Brown; Bare was his Foot, his ardent Breast reveal'd, The rest a Wreath of spotless white conceal'd; So thro' the Throng he pass'd with noble Grace, Enter'd the List, and rose upon the Place. Conspicuous now, as many knew his Name, A circling Whisper told his early Fame; All wonder'd how a Youth so softly young, Should dare a Champion so confirm'd and strong! Incens'd, a Foreign Arm should awe the Field, And make the Stoutest of their Natives yield; Conspiring Vows the generous Stripling wait, Conspiring Fears are felt for his Defeat. But chief the Youth the scornful Victor ey'd, And found the Match unequal to his Pride. Starting he fiercely stalk'd along the Plain, And thus presuming spoke—in jeering Strain. “Whence come this Infant?—or to whom belong? “Whose gentle Mien proclaims him nicely sprung! “Say, Child, thy Sire? or by what Folly led, “Hither thou camest? to softer Labours bred? “Return, nice Stripling, free from threaten'd harm, “Thy Fall would but disgrace my practis'd Arm! Then Gamelyn thus—“Insulting Boaster take, “In breif the Answer which I deign to make; “My Father's honour'd Name, while Life he drew, “Well known to Gallia, well is known to you; “Sir John of Bondis well in Battle known, “From him I spring—and am his youngest Son: “Gamelyn my Name—the rest let Tryal say, “I come to take the hazard of the Day. So spoke the blooming Youth with manly Pride, The kindling Foreigner enrag'd reply'd: “Thy Sire I knew, by wide Report proclaim'd, “A Knight for hardy Prowess not unfam'd, “Thy childish Frolicks too have reach'd our Ears, “Thy early Pertness far out strips thy Years; “But Stripes that growing Mischief should destroy, “For me I scorn to grapple with a Boy”! The Youth reply'd—” And hast thou heard my Name, “Then let th' Encounter tell thee what I am: “Welcome, the Champion cries, so may I thrive, “As from my Hands thou partst or partst alive. And now the setting Sun withdrew his Light, And Silver Cynthia usher'd in the Night; Bright o'er the Lawn she shed her clearest Beam, When to the List these last Contenders came; The disproportion'd Pair all Eyes employ, The harden'd Fleming, and the English Boy! His slightest Efforts first the Champion try'd, To bend the pliant Youth on every Side; As feels the rooted Plant the Northern Blast, And yields to rise more prevalently fast; So the rude Shock the artful Stripling bore, And closer press'd still gather'd Strength the more; Then foil'd, the Fleming's fruitless Rage increas'd, And diff'rent Motions fill his anxious Breast; Oft round the Youth this new Alcides wound, And Gamelyn like Antæus kept his Ground; Then thus.—“I see thy vast gigantic Pain, “To bring me down thy Victim on the Plain; “Now in return, accept what I repay, “To show my Thanks, and take it as it may!” So said, around the Champion's bulky Waste, His slender Arms the vigorous Stripling plac'd; Artful, unseen, his Foot was plac'd behind, Where to the left the struggling Cheif inclin'd; Turn'd from its Poize, his Body whelms the Ground, A loud Applause the joyful Circle crown'd! So once, if rightly sacred Stories tell, Jessides conquer'd, and Goliah fell! Revers'd, confounded the Insulterlay, His Visage rent with Pain and deep Dismay! Three Ribs distorted with the fatal Stroke, And his left Arm the cumbrous Downfal broke; To whom the Youth in terms exulting spoke. Say art thou foil'd, Sir Champion, dost thou own, This Cast for good? or shall it pass for none? To whom the Fleming—Whether so it be, “Ill chance the Man, who taught this Cast to thee! “Who from thy Youth expects to raise his Boast, “Shall, by Saint. Swithin, find his Labour lost”. But stronger Joy that fill'd the Farmer's Mind, The full Completion of his Hope to find, Exulting in his alter'd Visage spoke, And from his Tongue in hasty Transports broke. “Delightful Youth! sole Prop of my Desires, “Bless'd be the Day that warm'd thy vital Fires; “Bless'd be the Morn that sent thee to my Aid, “Bless'd be thy Arm that thus my Vengeance paid; “Now to this prostrate Miscreant can I say, “Here stands the Youth, that foil'd thee at the Play. To whom agast the suffering Champion cry'd, “Rough is his Play, as sorely have I try'd; “Full thirty Years, a Wrestler have I been, “Inur'd to Toils, and practis'd on the Green; “But by the Mass, of all I ever met, “None ever dealt so rudely with me yet”. Firm in the Place the smiling Victor stood, In hopes to see the pleasing Strife renew'd; “And is there none, he said, amongst you all, “Will venture on the Green to try a Fall”? In vain he call'd, in vain he look'd around, Nor Combatant beheld nor Answer found; From the assur'd Defiance all withdraw, The Fleming's Downfal kept the Field in Awe. Then from their Place the reverend Umpires came, While all the Crow'd repeats the Victor's Name! “Distinguish'd Youth, they cry'd, whoe'er thou be, “Thy Valour speaks thee of no low Degree; “Retire content—the further Fight decline, “All own the Glories of the Field are thine; “But Honour first that led thy Footsteps here, “Commends thy Safety to our faithful Care; “Cautions thy Health the Midnight Damp to shun, “Be ours to give the Prize thy Arm has won! “Then let the Herald tell the Sports are o're, “And let Repose thy short Fatigue restore. “I came, the Youth replies, to try your Fair, “Nor have I yet unfolded half my Ware; To whom the Fleming “Fool, I ween, is he, “Who meddles with thy Merchandise, or thee! “For me, by good Saint Gregory I swear, “I'll buy no more—thou sell'st it all too dear, The Farmer then, whose Joy could find no Vent, Said, Foreign Boaster! rest thee well content, “By bless'd Saint James of holy Pilgrims sought, “A penny worth hast thou of what thou bought! “For had my Wishes but obtain'd the Pow'r, “Thou never should have try'd this Traffick more. They ceas'd—for now the appointed Judges bring Thro' the admiring Crow'd the Ram and Ring; The pleasing Charge young Gamelyn's Servant takes, While thus th' assembled Throng his Lord bespeaks, “In the grey Sky yon eastearn streaks of Light, “Proclaim the waning Empire of the Night! “Let your Attendance than my Wishes grace, “My Father's Hall lies hence a little Space; “Thither your Company does Kindness pray, “Nor slight the slender Welcome Love would pay, “Such Cheer as our Domestic Vaults supply, “Shall speak my Thanks and crown our mutual Joy! Applause thro' the consenting Ring resounds, The Stripling mounts, the joyful Train surrounds; The Minstrelsie attends, 'tis Frolick all! And the wild Triumph hastens to the Hall! The Knight in different Guise the Night had spent, Perplext with Envy, torn with Discontent; Till chearful Morning glitt'ring in the East, Dispell'd all Gloom, but that within his Breast. Then starting Eager from his restless Bed, The wayward Caitiff shook his guileful Head; Earnest to learn the hated Gamelyn's Fate, He bent his Footsteps to the outer Gate: O'er the still Road he cast his baleful Eyes, Surpriz'd as soon the Dusty Vapour spies; A fainter Clamour next his Ears invades, And Men and Horse seem pictur'd in the Shades! But oh what Tumults in his Bosom rise, What cruel Envy darkens in his Eyes! When the known Youth he sees with conquest crown'd, Whom Music waits, and joyful Crowds surround; Pale grew his Cheek, to find his Purpose crost, And every cruel Expectation lost; With falt'ring Voice the Porter down he calls Summons his Servants to defend the Walls; Secures each Avenue with fearful Haste, And makes himself the slender Wicket fast; A wooden Bolt secur'd that Pass alone, For Theft and Fraud were then but little known. Now to the Tow'rs the jovial Train inclin'd, But look in vain Admittance there to find; From his fair Steed, dismounts our Gamelyn strait, Ascends the Steps, and thunders at the Gate. “Porter, I charge thee by my Father's Name, “Undo the Doors and let me Entry claim; “Spread every Passage to my Wishes wide; “For many a good Man's Son is at my Side; “Shame to our House, should I thus bring them here, “To send them back without a Neighbour's Cheer.” To whom the Porter, trembling as he eyed The laughing Rout, with feeble Voice reply'd, “Depart, young Squire, nor vainly idle stand, “Thou com'st not here, so gave my Lord Command; “Thou com'st not here, by good Saint Giles, I say, “Thy Roysters to some other Inn convey! “Depart, nor bring a Mischief on us both, “I know my Charge, and will not break my Oath. “So Heav'n still sheild me from all deadly Sin, Return'd the Squire—as mean I to get in. Nor more he said, but once his Foot apply'd, And the obedient Wicket open'd wide: At Sight of that the Keeper shook his Head, And trusting to his Feet, the Varlet fled. “Is that thy Shift? said Gamelyn, I trow, “I am of Foot as well expert as thou! As cuts the fearful Dove her airy Way, As stoops the tow'ring Falcon on his Prey; So by the Neck the Fugitive he took, And with one Grasp the yielding Texture broke. Down sunk the Wretch, a Well presented nigh A Depth, scarce fathom'd by the shrinking Eye! In this he headlong plung'd the wayward Slave, And sunk him breathless in the liquid Grave; Then to the Gate with Joy returning pass'd, Wide to the Wall the spreading Portals cast; The shouting Train into the Circle broke, While thus with pleasing Air, the Victor spoke. “A hearty Welcome here, my Friends, receive, “Here will we dine nor ask the Master's Leave; “But Yesterday, if right I can divine, “I left our Cellars well purvey'd in Wine; “Four Tuns of Claret, one of Malmsley good, “Rich to the Taste, and friendly to the Blood! “While one remaining Drop can chear the Heart, “Right loth I were, that you and I should part; “And if my surly Brother grudge th' Expence (“For well the selfish Niggard loves his Pence) “Ill let him fare the while and fret him worse, “Paid for his Envy with Saint Mary's Curse! “If Any quarrel else, why here we dwell, “Let the Fool seek his Answer in the Well! The glad Assembly eccho'd their Consent, And in the Multitude tumultuous went; The Squire commands, the fair Provision looks, And some the Butlers names, and some the Cooks: While others round the wide Pavilions stray, And all the Beauties of the Place survey; At length the breakfast Bell is heard to sound, The Cloath is spread, the social Bowl is crown'd! A splendid Dinner next adorns the Board, With all the Pomp of English Plenty stor'd; Not the luxurious Whims of modern Date, The Bane of Health, the Poison of the Great! By whose Effects Nobility we trace, The dwindling Product of a wanton Race; But manly Food that hardy Warriors bred, Who greatly triumph'd, or who nobly bled! So well the Master had dispos'd the Feast, The Company to part seem'd not in haste; At Ev'n the sparkling Cup allur'd the Eye, The Joke was rais'd—and rural Wit ran high. Seven Days had Ceres chear'd the jolly Band! Seven Nights had Bacchus wav'd his ruddy Brand! As season'd with Delight the Moments flew, And still the Entertainment seem'd as new. Up in a little Turret lay the Knight, Devoid of Service and consum'd with Spite! Nor durst he say that ought he saw was wrong, For Fear, his master Passion, ty'd his Tongue. But Pleasure will not in its Nature last, And Joy repeated dies upon the Taste. Now orient Phœbus shed his golden Flame, And the eighth Morning of the Banquet came; When came the grateful Strangers to the Squire, And beg'd his kind Permission to retire; For all his Bounties humble Thanks they pay, But Business must be serv'd, and call'd away! Some to their Trades, and to their Labours some. Each long'd impatient for his dearer Home; The gen'rous Youth in vain their March delay'd, The more persisted they, the more he pray'd; In vain he courted, and in vain he show'd, The Shame of leaving Liquor while 'twas good; To his Request, they all as firm deny'd, To theirs, he as reluctantly comply'd; To Heav'ns Protection they the Squire commend, And full of Gamelyn's Praises homeward bend. Yet of the Body clustring that came in, The Shadow in the last Retreater's seen; As melts the Snow-Ball by degrees away, So drop'd the loose Deserters of each Day! Now comes the General Thaw—and leaves no Trace Of all the busy Crowd that fill'd the Place! The Triumph ended—every Guest was gone, And Gamelyn left to meditate alone; No Friend to counsel—in the dubious Case, To fly with Safety, or to stay with Grace? How for the best his Conduct to devise, To keep his Pow'r, or seek to compromise? Nor thought he long, for from his airy Void, Where he so long had seen his Stores destroy'd; Now finding the all dreaded Locusts gone, The angry Knight encourag'd ventur'd down; Advancing to the Youth with sullen Air, “So Brother mine, he said, I see your Fare! “You and your Revelry have rul'd the Roast, “My Goods abus'd, and my Provisions lost; “My Cellars drain'd of all my choicest Wine, “Who gave thee thus to squander what is mine? “Once, well I think, thou prated'st much of Might, “How lawless Force oppresses weaker Right; “But by Saint Martin, make the Case your own, “You just can do, as other Folks have done! “Brother, the Youth replys, your Wrath forbear, “What I have spent of yours has cost me dear; “Now o'er my Head have sixteen Summers pass'd, “Since thou my distin'd Heritage possess'd; “Of all the Profits of the fair Amount, “Nor hast thou giv'n or Reason, or Account; “For what thou losest by my friendly Band, “Let the large Interest answer thy Demand; “Omit no Article, enlarge the least, “Be to the Height thy Damage thus replac'd: “To this, a Trifle all our Mirth has spent, “Nor scarce the Value of thy monthly Rent. To whom the Knight—with secret Guile replete: “Good Brother cease, I matter not the Treat: “Nor grudge thy Train my Victuals or my Wine, “Welcome art thou to any thing is mine; “Thou know'st in Wife or Child am I unblest, “To whom I may bequeath my Lands possess'd: “'Tis thine to dissipate or thine to spare, “For, by Saint Martin, I design thee Heir! To whom the Squire—“Canst thou so friendly be, “If with thy Tongue thy Heart sincere agree, “So help me Heaven as still I honour thee! For Gamelyn's Soul, to Falseshood unally'd, Was still deluded with the fairer Side; His Brother then-“One thing I left to say, “Rash was the Vow my Passion made the Day, “When by thy fatal Arm my Porter fell, “Slain in the Court, and bury'd in the Well; “For then my Anger swore thy Limbs to bind, “Nor can I from my Oath Evasion find; “Could thou a Moment's Space the Durance bear, “My Love should make thy Fetters light as Air! “The short Consent would quit my harsh Decree, “More would I do, I think for Sake of thee.” To whom the Youth-“The pleasing Bonds I take, “Thou never shalt be perjur'd for my Sake. By Flattery thus the Knight his Purpose gains; The Servants call'd bring out the destin'd Chains: The Youth sits down, the Fetters on they brace, And deadly Ruin wears a smiling Face! But when the Caitiff saw each Lock secure, And that the cheated Youth was pris'ned sure; Then from its Covert dark Resentment burst, And with imbitter'd Rage he doubly curs'd! Fire darted from his Eyes and swell'd his Breast; While thus the Wretch his cruel Thought express'd. “Go take this Royster hence, this graceless Boy, “Who nurs'd in Ease takes Pleasure to destroy; “Had he the Rule of our paternal Hall, “Soon by his Waste our Opulence would fall: “What Wealth could his Extravagance supply? “Dogs would devour, and Beasts would drink him dry! “A Pillar stands amidst the Lobby plac'd, “Thither convey the Fool, and bind him fast; “There let him dream of Tournaments and Fights, “Of his late Riots, and his wassell Nights! “Nor Meat nor Drink his Vision shall sustain, “Fasting will help the Frenzy of his Brain; “Who dares within our Roof his Wants supply, “Shall with Disgrace expell'd our Service fly. “And acts thou so? the generous Youth reply'd, “Fool that I was to trust a Traytor try'd! “Too weak indeed! who knew thy Faith before, “Again to put my Safety in thy Pow'r; “But Monster go! thy hellish Conquest boast, “Thy Brother fetter'd, and thy Honour lost! “Happy for thee, I knew not thy Design, “Else had I paid thy Guile in better Coin; “But sate thy Malice, send me to my Grave, “My Heart disdains thee, like thy meaness Slave. Their Lord's Command the servile Train obey, And to his Post the captive Youth convey; There in Confinement strict the Prisoner stands, Inchain'd his Feet, and manacled his Hands; Yet in his noble Air and Look serene, The dauntless Temper of his Mind was seen; There to the dewy Marble fetter'd fast, Two tedious Days and Nights of Want he pass'd; The Jest or Pity of the passing Crowd, Who ey'd him often, silent as he stood; Some with a tender Look his Fate beheld, But Fear of Blame the falling Drop conceal'd. Others of baser Stamp, the Worms of Pow'r, Who take their motly Hire from Fortune's hour: To pay their Court, employ their scurril Store, And wound the generous Victim o'er and o'er. With Famine wasted, feeble with Restraint, Gamelyn began to feel his Vigour faint; Now the third Morn had Sol his Lamp renew'd, Since no Supply had fed the Vital Flood; Slow from his Heart heav'd the exhausted Tide, O'er his dim Eyes the misty Vapours glide: When first the Youth on Adam fix'd his Sight, Who saw with much Concern his heavy Plight; He in his Father's Service spent his Youth, Known was his Honesty, approv'd his Truth. Oft had his Arms the smiling Infant press'd, His Care attended, and his Faith caress'd; To him the Youth, for his Deliverance seeks, And thus the antient Servant mild bespeaks. “Adam! my Father to thy Youth was kind, “Nor do I think his Favours out of Mind. “What need to tell my Case, or shew my Wrong? “These Walls, if they could speak, would save my Tongue; “Didst thou from Infancy good Bondis serve, “And canst thou see his Favourite chain'd to starve? “Perish I must, if you Relief deny, “This Lent was never made for you or I. “Then prithee, honest Butler, look the Keys, “And bring my wearied Limbs some little Ease; “As freely thou the just Reward demand, “And take the Half of my paternal Land. To whom the Butler—(half to yield inclin'd, Yet fearful as he felt his dubious Mind) “Thy Father, Gamelyn, I dearly knew, “Nor want to learn the Love he bore to you! “Thy Brother have I serv'd now Years sixteen “And with domestick Cares have trusted been; “Shall I, when Age has made my Temples grey, “Abuse my Place, what would my Master say? “Adam, reply'd the Youth, to me be just, “Nor shall you thence betray your antient Trust; “Thou seest my Brother's Falshood shown to me, “How canst thou hope he will be true to thee; “Alas! the Wretch is by no Ties confin'd, “'Tis Interest only rules his sordid Mind; “Tis that alone does all his Actions guide, “Treason to Traytors, ne'er can be apply'd; “For me, I yield thee all my Lands to share, “Thou knowst my Word, accept it if thou dare! Adam was honest—but like all the Tribe, He had a secret Biass to the Bribe: Soon he consented to the Squire's Request, And promis'd for his Sake to try his best; So parted they on mutual Terms agreed. The Tale, perhaps, grows long, kind Muse, proceed! Now drowsy Morpheus with his leaden Rod, Had shed his Influance o'er the still Abode; When Adam to his Master's Chamber crept, And stole the Keys as silently he slept; Then hasten'd Gamelyn, his Charge, to find, For still, the promis'd Land was in his Mind. The Chains were loos'd—the Youth new Spirits found, Bestir'd his Arms, and mov'd along the Ground. “To Heav'n I yield the Thanks, and next to Thee, “He cry'd, Good Adam, thus to find me free: “Wouldst thou but in thy Pantry spread the Board, “And give me what thy Cellars can afford; “For once refresh'd, if I mistake not quite, “Not all the House should fetter me To-night. So saying, thro' the spacious Hall they pass'd, Led by the Light the distant Taper cast; Together to the lighted Pantry come, Where Gamelyn finds prepared a little Room; The ready Cloath purvey'd was set in View, And Adam bid him welcome, and fall to! Nor needed he the Invitation twice, But heard the Call, his Stomach was not nice! Next Adam fills with Wine the silver Cup, And drinks his Health, the hearty Brimmer up! Renew'd, the Youth the smiling Cordial took, And gave him back his Pledge with friendly Look; Returning Vigour mantles in his Breast, His sparkling Eyes returning Life confess'd! To Adam then—“I give thee to divine “What is the present Shape of my Design; “I mean to seek my Brother in his Bed, “And with one Stroke to doom the Traitor dead. “Not so, said Adam, Heav'n thy Arm restrain, “Nor soil your Honour with so foul a Stain. “My present Views to safer Counsels bend, “Which Prudence guides, and with Success shall end; “To-morrow holds Sir John his Sunday's Feast, “With all our neighb'ring Ecclesiastics grac'd; “From the huge Abbot, and the jolly Prior, “To the sly Monk, and gormandizing Friar! “The Knight, tho' otherwise inclin'd to spare, “Yet loves to get our Mother-Church's Pray'r; “And nothing buys it sooner than a Treat, “For well these holy Locusts love to eat! “Now to thy former Post shall thou repair, “Thy Fetters seeming fasten'd as they were; “While thus the motly Tribe pass on your Way, “The speckled Brotherhood, black, brown, or grey! “Prefer your Suit, implore the Church's Aid, “To move your Brothers Pity on your Head. “Tell them from Faith that Hope at first begins, “And Charity can hide a Heap of Sins: “If they compassionate, thy Cause maintain, “Then art thou free, and blameless I remain; “But if, as from their Stamp, I better guess, “Thy just Petition meet with no Success; “If they, disdainfull, thy Demand refuse, “Thou need'st no more but shake thy Fetters loose; “Two trusty Staves shall lie prepar'd at Hand, “One shall I take, and one shall thou command; “Nor grudge the Discipline we give each Brother; “Ill thrive the first, I say, that fails the other. Gamelyn the while, with laughing like to die, Scarce cou'd recover Breath to form Reply. ‘By good Saint Martyn, worship thee I ought, “Adam, he cry'd, it was a glorious Thought. “So may I drink my Wine, and tell my Tale, “As on my Side will the Adventure fail! “Right well shall I absolve them of their Sin, “Give but the Signal, when we shall begin. “That shall I do, the Butler blythe reply'd, “Mark when I wink, then cast thy Bonds aside; “Secure thy Staff, be ready at my Hand, “And we shall count at large the Holy Band. To whom the Youth, still Adam may thou speed, “For better Counsel never came at need; “If these good Folks deny for me to pray, “I trust, they shall not scape without their Pay. The Bottle ended,—Adam Gamelyn press'd, To snatch an Hour, of necessary Rest; Then e're the early Porter left his Bed, Back to his Post, the joyful Youth he led; Impatient there to wait approaching Noon, When the intended Farce should be begun. Now Morning dawns, the Servants rise with Care, And for the Business of the Day prepare; The Knight to Mass rides out with Pride elate, At noon returning, brings his Guests in State; Close by his Side, a mitred Abbot rode, Three Priors follow'd, each a Horses Load! Canons and Monks well mounted next appear, The barefoot Mendicants bring up the Rear; The puffing Drones from every Quarter pour, Bred, not to make the Honey, but devour! All as they enter fair Attendance find, And large Respect, well suited to their Mind; While scornful at the Door each passing by, On fetter'd Gamelyn cast a sullen Eye. Whose Sufferings still his Brother's Pastime made, While of the Youth a thousand Lyes he said; Told how the Boy, had lost his Wits with Pride, And thence in that Confinement so was ty'd; The sordid Crowd the Punishment commend, Not one appears to be Misfortune's Friend; Each in Invective labour'd to excel, And Gamelyn saw that Adam knew them well! But now the Bell salutes their longing Ears, The Dinner, spendid to their Wish, appears; Each to their fav'rite Dish instructed drew, For Feasting was a Province well they knew! Now had they seen some Courses two or three, When Gamelyn said, “Pray Friends how serve ye me? “Not equitable quite its seems at least, “The Son should perish, while the Strangers feast: Sir John replies,—“This Babler mind no more, “The Boy is wild, I told ye so before! “And yet, methinks, his Voice is pretty strong, “For one that has been dinnerless so long. But Gamelyn now intent, what Adam said, Observing, thus his low Addresses made, “From Greatness Sorrow still Relief shou'd find, “And gen'rous Pity shows a noble Mind. “To ling'ring Death appointed here I stand, “O shame to Nature, by a Brother's Hand! “Then by his Passion, who for Sinners bled, “Ye Rev'rend Prelates, for my Freedom plead! “Let my slight Fault your Intercession crave, “Your Goodness from devoted Ruin save! “So may each Saint your just Petitions own; “And on your Heads send num'rous Blessings down”! To whom an Abbot with distemper'd Cheek: “Who for thy graceless Head presumes to speak, “Deserves himself to be corrected worse; “For me, I give him holy Church's Curse! “But blest the Man, who thus ordains thy Fate, “And punishes a Wretch that all shou'd hate! He ceas'd; and thus a Canon next begun: “Wert Thou, ungracious Youth, my only Son; “To Death deserv'd my Voice shou'd bid thee go! “My Eye, like Brutus, tearless see the Blow”. All at the Canon's wond'rous Learning gaze, And All agree to give his Judgement Praise. But most a pamper'd Monk; who thought it wrong, “That such a wicked Lad had liv'd so long! But strong Resentment Gamelyn's Bosom fir'd, Flash'd from his Eye, and all his Arm inspir'd; “Go on, he cries, to pay your wretched Court, “Make Pow'r your Idol, Innocence your Sport! “I see the Fate, Misfortune still attends, “I find the Truth; The wretched have no Friends! “Go on, your murderous Mischiefs to devise, “Ye ravenous Wolves, tho' dress'd in Lambs disguise! “Curss'd for my Sake, be he in Flesh and Blood, “That ever does to Church, or Churchmen Good! This while on Adam well he fix'd his Look, Who just the Covering from the Table took; With Pleasure Adam mark'd his Passion rise, And to the Door directed with his Eyes; Where Gamelyn saw the Staves were ready plac'd, Then view'd the Wink;—and off his Fetters cast; As soon he to the trusty Weapon flew, And roun'd the Hall, his angry Aspect threw. “Adam, he cry'd, do thou the Pass secure, “Nor let a Cowl uncustom'd pass the Door. “Mien while shall I examine all within, “And help to shrive them from their deadly Sin! “Methinks they keep not Vigils as they ought, “They look as better fed, by far, than taught; “They want some Discipline to cool the Blood, “Perhaps this wholsome Staff may do some good; “But to the Cloth due Reverence let me show, “And take them in their Order as they go”. Then on the Abbot's lordly Flank he laid, Such Pennance as before was never made; The Cannon next a-long his browny Side, Felt the unusual Remedy apply'd, Half dead with Pain beneath the Table fell; Follow'd a Monk, who scap'd not quite so well! Thick as the Hail-stones form the wintry Show'r, So thick the Strokes amongst the Synod pour; Chairs overturn'd with Hoods, confuse the Hall, And the unsparing Cudgel levels all! But in a Corner safe, the Laymen stood, And unconcern'd the Church's Danger view'd; With secret Signs, they prais'd the friendly Hand, That dealt such Interest to the selfish Band; Nor had they Pity on the haughty Drones, Who dignify themselves,—The Church's Sons. To Gamelyn then delighted Adam cry'd, “Pay well the Wages due to every Hide, “Here shall I stand, nor one shall pass unseen, “Who cannot show thy Livery on his Skin! “That shall I do, said Gamelyn, by my Troth, “To cheat the Church, I should be sadly loth; “Not here a Man shall miss his ample Pay, “From his first Clerkship, to this present Day; “Then keep thy Post, pass none without a blow; “And we shall mark the Sheep before they go. “Dear Youth says Adam, do them all but good, “But take good Heed, thy weapon draw no Blood; “Save well the Tonsure, and avoid the Head, “But beat and bruise them, till they lie for Dead, “Spare neither Back, nor Leg, nor Thigh, nor Arm, “I shou'd not care to do them greater Harm! So Gamelyn and Adam foil'd their Foes So met the disappointed Priests with Blows; They to the Dinner rode, with joyful Haste, But ill they lik'd the ending of the Feast; Forc'd, maim'd and sore, unpity'd to depart, The Load of many a Wain, and many a Cart; A Frier, whose Bones the Discipline had try'd, As the fat Abbot press'd his aking Side: Cry'd, “Good my Lord, what Planet rul'd to Day, “And led our luckless Steps, this cursed Way; “Better at home, our Vigils had we kept, “Taken a cordial Dose, and wisely slept: “By good Saint Mary, but the Boy was warm, “And laid it on with a remorseless Arm; “But soon the Church's Vengeance shall be paid, “And all our fearful Thunder blast his Head. While Gamelyn pleas'd to see the Work go on, Had laid his Hands o'er many a shaven Crown; His Brother shrinking in a Corner lay, Dreading the Close of this ill-omen'd Fray; Him Gamelyn spy'd, and where th' embracing Blade Sustains entwining the supported Head; Strong fell his Arm, the yielding Sinues break, And the distorted Muscles mark his Back! Then by the Arm, he leads him to the Place, So late the Scene of his reveng'd Disgrace; “Now Knight, he cries, by good St. James I swear, “I mean to make you try a Brother's Fare, “Your Passions oft are apt to grow too loud, “But Fasting qualisies the Heat of Blood; “You have enjoy'd your Pleasure as you may, “My turn is next,—each Man must have his Day. To Adam turning,—then the Youth went on, “I hold it right we wash, our Task is done: “If foil'd perhaps our Hands with mortal Sin, “Let Silver Medway's Current make us clean; “Then sit we down,—my Stomach calls to Eat; “Mass never was design'd to hinder Meat. So to the ready Board, with chearful Air, The honest Butler and the Squire repair: While oft the genial Bowl is sent around, And oft to mutual Faith the Brimmer crown'd; Adam with Humour paints, the Church's Flight, And Gamelyn drinks, Deliverance to the Knight; The duteous Servants wait the Youth's Commands, Rejoyc'd to see him saved from deadly Bands. So pass their Hours, while Fortune's Hand prepares, Severer Trials and succeeding Cares; Not five Mile distant lay the Sheriff's Court, Thither in Crowds the noisy Monks resort; The Sacriledge display with venom'd Tongues, And call the civil Arm to aid their Wrongs; From Drone to Drone the loud Invective flies, For touch one Wasp, and all the Nest will rise. Incens'd the Sheriff heard the large Complaint, But seeks his Vengeance from a secret Feint; Twice ten he chuses of his wonted Band, Full resolute to act his close Command; Whose vig'rous Nerves unwasted Youth supply'd, In Order faithful, and in Contest try'd! To them unfolds the Manner of the Deed, And promises large Gifts if they succeed. As bold they answer—to the neighb'ring Sign, He sends them first, where at his Cost they dine; The Bowl succeeds, till Day withdraws its Light, And Hesper gilds the gloomy Brow of Night. To Business then they bid their Pleasure yield, And out they march appointed for the Field. And now along the silent Way they trod, Still was the Night, and Darkness reign'd abroad. The Birds were hush'd within their peaceful Nests, And Trouble wak'd alone in human Breasts; O'er the known Heath, across the dewy Grass, And thro' the quiet Village on they pass; Where as the Centinel their Motion hears, He often barks, and often pricks his Ears! So deep a Sable now usurp'd the Skies, They hope to win the Castle by Surprize, When from afar, to damp the recent Joy, The glimmering Taper's Beam confus'd they spy. Short at the Sight their present Course they break, And halt to form what Measures now to take. A Copse beneath the Castle's Summit lay, Thither their new Resolve directs the Way; There they intend approaching Morn to wait, And try by Stratagem to gain the Gate. Aurora smil'd—and from the russet Lawn, Up sprung the chearful Lark to hail the Dawn! When void of Weapons and in Clowns disguise, Knock at the Gate the two selected Spies; With harmless Guise their fatal Purpose dress, And call the Porter and demand Access. The watchful Porter from his Lodge unseen, Had view'd their March and mark'd their dubious Mien; Who lov'd the noble Youth and fear'd Deceit, Requires their Message—nor unbarrs the Gate. To whom, we come with no unfriendly Mind, “To warn the gentle Squire of Harm design'd,; “This Morning, as to woodland Work we went, “Some Strangers we observ'd of ill Intent; “Hither we heyed us by our Duty prest, “Pray let us in, your Lord shall know the rest. “Not so—reply'd the Servant—stand ye still, “And I shall let you know our master's Will: Then in to Gamelyn's Hall as fast he goes, “Make ready, Lord, for here arrive your Foes; “Two of the Sheriff's Villains watch the Gate; “And seek your Ear—but there I bad them wait. “Thanks trusty Friend, the dauntless Youth reply'd, “Back to the Gate and see what may betide; “You soon shall find if Foes so near there be, “They shall not meet an easy Prize in me. To Adam then—” For Contest now prepare, “The pleasing Toils of honourable War! “Pow'r threatens loud, and Prudence bids retreat; “Yet must I try these Heroes at the Gate: “If thou assist as on a former Day, “They shall not go from hence without their Pay. To whom the Butler—“So may Heaven befriend, “One Course shall guide us, and one Fate attend; “Do thou perform thy Part, as with the Friers. “Some of these Knaves shall bed among'st the Briers. Then on their trusty Staves at once they seize, And at the postern Gate pursue their Ways; As once conjoin'd the Grecian Chiefs of old, Ulysses sage, and Diomede the Bold, So silent by the winding Moat they pass'd, Till on their Foes a nearer View they cast: For now assembling the collected Band In the King's Name an Entry loud demand; Nor longer Semblance or Disguise put on, But seek with Force to break the Barrier down. As when the Bird of Jove amid'st the Skies, With piercing Eye the distant Quarry spys: Collects his Fire—intrepid darts his Way, And falls resistless on the yielding Prey! So at the Sight young Gamelyn's Breast grew warm, He flew—and three were lost beneath his Arm. One Adam following fell'd—nor needed more To dissipate the rude ungovern'd Pow'r. Fear lent them Wings, and well those Wings they try'd, To seek their Safety—Nature was their Guide. “What ho! cry'd Adam, Friends! why so much Haste, “Will you not stay and take a short Repast? “No, by the Mass (said one) your Sample's bad; “I like not where such Dainties may be had. With that away the fearful Caitiff flew, And in the neighb'ring Shades escap'd the View. The Scuffle ended Gamelyn look'd around, And at the wide Horizon's distant Bound, Far as the Sight its Progress could extend, He saw a gathering Cloud of Dust ascend; “Adam, he cry'd, or I mistake me quite, “But here the Sheriff comes with all his Might. “Wisdom forbids us longer to remain, “Haste let us go and seek the Sylvan Scene! “Better to wander in these Shades alone, “For what is Life, when Liberty is gone? Agreed, said Adam. Sir, I keep my Vow, I call you mine, nor Fate shall part us now! But e'er we go indulge one social Glass, 'Twill chear us for the Lot we must embrace. The Squire assents, the sparkling Cup goes round, And quick they leave the shortly dangerous Ground; Pursue the Margin of the Medway Flood, And gain by Noon the Shelter of the Wood. And now advance the Posse's wide Array, And meet their first Detachment on the Way. Enrag'd the Sheriff urges on his Course, The Castle opens to the Sov'reign's Force; But more incens'd to find the Guilty fled, He vows Destruction on the Rebel's Head; Then hastes to bring the captive Knight Release, Who long had sat confin'd in doleful Case; And for a skilful Leech as soon they seek, To heal the wayward Wight's distorted Neck. So leave we them a while—with Care renew'd To wait our gentle Exiles in the Wood; Long march'd they on, and took but little Rest, The Shadows lengthen'd, and the Day decreas'd; The Path grew narrow, and the dubious Way Was often stopp'd by the entwining Spray; Adam, whose Pantry still ran in his Mind, Relish'd but ill his living on the Wind; “By good Saint Kit, said he, my loving Squire, “A Butler's Life was ever my Desire. “Right well I like the keeping of the Keys: “Faith, I was never made for Toils like these: “Better at home in Plenty pass the Day, “Than in these empty Forests pine away. “Repine not, Friend, the noble Youth reply'd; “Heav'n owns our Cause, and Fortune be our Guide “Nor judge of Happiness by present Rest; “Hardships are oft the Fortune of the Best! Thus, as in Talk the tedious Way they cheer, Heav'n drew her sable Stole along the Sphere, When sudden Adam gave surpriz'd a Start, And felt a sudden Fear assault his Heart. He stopt to listen, thro' the quiv'ring Shade; The broken Sounds anew his Ears invade. On Gamelyn he looks, who heard the same, Nor knew as yet from whence the Accents came; Till gently bending thro' the op'ning Trees, A large Assembly banquetting he sees, As oft, so legendary Fables feign, The little Elves bestrew the Midnight-Plain. From Eyes profane their mystick Revels keep, And sport unseen, when wretched Mortals sleep: So thro' the Gloom, distinct with spangled Light, An hundred Archers rose to Gamelyn's Sight; Stretch'd at their Ease, the Ground with Viands spread, And many a Cup was fix'd to many a Head! “Now, Adam (soft he cry'd) retract your Fault; “Heav'n now, you see, is kinder than you thought. “You see, from black Despair it can restore, “And bring Relief, when Hope can do no more! “So now it seems—For, Adam, well, I think, “I see the sight of Victu'ls and of Drink. “But, lest I err—assist me with thy View, “And tell me, if my Eyes inform me true? Then Adam stooping well perceiv'd the Feast, And only wish'd for leave to be a Guest. “Good Squire, he cries, I see right plenteous Fare; “Heav'n send I only knew to get my Share! He spoke; the Words too vehemently said, The hasty Speaker, and his Friend betray'd. The Master Outlaw started from the Shade, And to his Train, with some Emotion, said, “To Arms, my Lads: For by the holy Rood, “I fear some near, who mean us little good. “Perhaps, as Spies, to usher more behind: “Go Ten of you! and see how blows the Wind? Quick rise the Band, the neighb'ring Gloom explore, And find the Vagrants of the darksome Hour! Yet gently, for the Bus'ness they profest, The Outlaw Train the Strangers thus addrest; “Young Men, your Weapons to our hands consign, “And trust our Faith, and tell us your Design. Then Gamelyn answer'd—“Ill you judge the Field, “If you imagine, I was born to yield. “Ten are you now; let Ten be added more; “Nor shall I fly you, tho' you were Threescore, Surpriz'd they heard the Words the Stripling said, And charm'd, his manly Air and Face survey'd. Then one return'd—“Preserve your Weapons still, “But come with us, and know our Master's Will. “Be it our Care, as was our Charge to bring “You straitways to the Presence of our King, To whom the gen'rous Gamelyn, pleas'd, reply'd, “I go content; be you our friendly Guide! “But, on your Faith, the Honour of your Sword, “Who is your King? What mean you by the Word! To whom return'd the Spokesman of the Train, “We live the free-born Natives of the Plain: “No formal Tie, nor nobler Union binds, “But Friendship firm, the Sympathy of Minds! “From hence, in common our Enjoyment springs, “We boast a Privilege as great as Kings! “Conquest gives them a Right; why not the same “To us? The diff'rence only lies in Name. “Yet Silk and Ermine veil those haughty Elves; “The Great can bear no Robbers but themselves. “With us our own Election bears the sway; “We prove our Chief, then chuse, and then obey! “Such is our King; I wait you to his Sight; “He Merit loves, and will receive you right. “Adam (said Gamelyn) let us then proceed “If courteous be this Captain, as I read; “He will receive us civilly at least, “And let us nobly of his Bounty taste; “Go on, cry'd Adam, wait us Ill or Good, “I'll venture every Chance in hopes of Food.” So dubious they attend the Greenwood Band, And in the Leader's Presence quickly stand. Beneath the Covert of an ample Shade, The Sylvan Monarch's mossy Throne was spread; In Dress a Forrester array'd in Green, Hung o'er his Side his glittering Horn was seen: With which full oft he made the Woods resound, When at the Call his Archers flock'd around! His nervous Arm sustain'd the weighty Bow, Fierce was his Port, and sullen was his Brow, When thus—“Whence come you Strangers, what you are “Your Names, your Dwelling and Intent declare, “If artful Spies of cruel Pow'r you come, “Ill was the Hour, or dread shall be your Doom; “But if by Men, and social Ills betray'd, “You seek the Covert of the friendly Shade; “Dismiss your Fears, to our Protection trust, “And learn that Outlaws are to Honour just.” To whom the dauntless Youth with decent Pride And all the Dignity of Truth reply'd: “When Malice triumphs, Innocence must yield, “When Towns grow dangerous, Men must walk the Field, “Better with Freedom range the Woodland Scene, “Than bear the Tyranny of worthless Men: “Such is our Case—no base born Spies you see, “But honest Exiles press'd with Misery; “Who wander devious thro' the Forest-Lawn, “In hopes to shoot some Deer or tender Fawn! Compassion seiz'd the rugged Leader's Breast, “Dismiss your Fears, I take you for my Guest; “Sit welcome here, and share our coarse Repast, “Want knows no Forms, 'tis time to break your Fast. Right glad was Adam of the kind Request, Nor needed Invitation to the Feast. The Strangers sit—while all on Gamelyn gaze, And silently admiring, silent praise; Till one who formerly had present been When the defeated Flemming press'd the Green, In Whispers to his Fellow told his Name, Till circling reach'd the Leader's Ear his Fame! Thence with new Confidence the Youth was grac'd, And next their Chief in Power and Honour plac'd Such the Reward unshelter'd Merit finds, So Valour triumphs ev'n o'er savage Minds! Not long they had the Sylvan Life pursu'd, And rang'd with Outlaws the remotest Wood, When to the Chief the pleasing News were sent, Of offer'd Grace and ended Banishment; With rising Joy he view'd the opening Scene, For still the social Tye is felt within; Yet half reluctant to desert his Sway, And leave the faithful Train his Call obey: He summons round his bold obedient Hearts, And thus the Purpose of his Soul imparts! “Ye noble Spirits, ye associate Minds! “Whom Griefs assemble, and whom Honour binds, “Ye Sons of Want, in sharpest Honours try'd, “Whose Trust has chose this Arm to be your Guide, “Tydings I bring—uncertain how they please, “Pardon recalls me to domestick Ease; “Yet vain the Offer—had I still been young, “Had not advancing Years my Nerves unstrung! “But Nature yielding courts the Hope of Rest, “And Time has damp'd the Fever in my Breast! “Your martial Toils a nobler Chief demand, “Your Dangers ask a more determin'd Hand. “And see in Gamelyn, all your Wishes bent, “Behold a Leader Heav'n it self has sent, “To him contented I the Rule resign, “Whose Conduct well shall pay the Loss of mine! He spoke—his Archers answer'd with a Cry, And wide the Voice of Eccho wafts the Joy! Round Gamelyn's Head the Regal Mark is ty'd, The glittering Horn suspended by his Side; With gallant Air he greets the cheerful Band, And takes each faithful Archer by the Hand; While some the abdicating Chief convey, Safe in his Passage to the publick Way. Now Gamelyn rul'd, and led the outlaw Train In all their wide Excursions o'er the Plain; No Blood he shed, still gentle to the Poor, He only tax'd the Overgrowth of Store: But chief to Monks and Priests was he severe; He knew the Church had Wealth enough to spare; And well he paid their Charity in kind, For deep it lay remember'd in his Mind. Soon to his envious Brother reach'd the Tale That Gamelyn rul'd the Outlaws in the Dale; A sudden Joy, malicious, seiz'd his Breast, And fed the Vengeance long his Mind possess'd; Late had the Royal Mandate to his Claim, Assign'd the Honours of the Sheriff's Name; The Scheme he plans, the strong Indictment draws, In all the aggravated Strain of Laws. And Truth and Nature to his Rage subdu'd, Fixes the Value of fraternal Blood; Then casts about his secret Haunts to know, And aim with Certainty the fatal Blow! Far different Thoughts his Brother's Vassals had, Their Lord's impending Ruin made them sad; They knew his Goodness, wish'd for his Command, And hop'd to thrive beneath his milder Hand. With Zeal inspir'd, the noted Wood they tread, And find their Lord amidst the friendly Shade. To whom the Forms of Duty first express'd, They tell the Cause which has their March address'd. “Forgive us, noble Youth, nor disapprove “This rude Intrusion of officious Love. “Ill News we bring; but for your Safety brought “To shun the Danger, of the Danger taught: “The Sheriff's Pow'r now fills your Brother's Hands, “And ample Kent obeys his wide Commands; “Late has his Wrath the cruel Doom proclaim'd, “Thy Life is purchas'd, and the Price is nam'd. “Warn'd by our Counsel chuse some safe Retreat, “And keep thy Virtues for a happier Fate. “Fool that I was, the generous Youth reply'd, “To spare his Neck, when I deform'd his Side: “But you, return! my Friends with Kindness greet, “And tell them Gamelyn Danger loves to meet; “So Heav'n my Fortunes and my Life defend, “As I this Brother-Sheriff shall attend; Nor less indeed, I ween, was his Intent, For Gamelyn never spoke but what he meant. The Day arriv'd, the crowded Court was held, The wayward Sheriff all his Pomp reveal'd, When boldly to the high Surprize of all, The hardy Youth appear'd before the Hall; First, to his Country paid the Honours due, Then on his Brother cast a scornful View; When thus, “Degenerate both in Form and Heart, “Thou Foe to Truth, and Stranger to Desert! “Say, thou inhumane Tyrant! Name the Cause, “Why thus I stand, the Outcast of the Laws? “Why with inveterate Rage my Life pursued, “And thirsts thy Malice for a Brother's Blood?” “Well art thou found, the Knight returns with haste; “Dear shall thou pay this Boldness, and the past; “The Righteous Law already dooms thee dead; “And Justice hovers round thy hot-brain'd Head! “Go seize the Boy—to Prison safe convey, “There let him wait till Justice comes her Way!” In Durance now behold the Youth immur'd, With Want attended, and in Bolts secur'd: But still superior to Affliction's State, He views the threat'ning Precipice of Fate. One Beam appear'd—a trusty Hand he gains With ample Promise buys his secret Pains; To him his Purpose careful he commends, And to his Brother Otto, faithful, sends; Otto, who prov'd retir'd from Cares and Toil, The grateful Leisure of the plenteous Soil! With Grief his kindly Brother hears the News, Resolv'd to save,—and not a Moment lose; His fleetest Steed awaits his instant Call, And swift he seeks his old paternal Hall. Friendship is still the Test of noble Minds, He gains the Castle, and the Knight he finds. “Brother, abrupt he says, when Pow'r's misplac'd, “Oft Virtue bleeds, and Merit is disgrac'd; “Yet stranger Cruelty infects your Mind, “A Brother to a Brother should be kind; “Three were we left in one kind Parent blest, “And Love and Union was his last Request; “Committed to thy Faith and Guardian care, “He left this fav'rite Child, his youngest Heir; “And will thy Heart inhumane doom the Boy, “A Brother's Hand, a Brother's Life destroy? “To wretched Cain so guiltless Abel fell, “Go thou, and copy the first Son of Hell. “Forbear thy railing, answer'd short the Knight, “Nor blast my Justice with the Name of Spite; “Her Scale I ballance, and her Sword I wield, “To her I bid each Tie inferior yield; “Nor Blood I value, nor Relation know, “When the Law points my Brother as a Foe; “Thy Intercession makes his Case the worse, “There let him lie—till Justice takes her Course.” “Not so, by Heav'n, incens'd Sir Otto said, “Nor shall thy Malice hurt our Brother's Head; ‘Thou talk'st of Law, by that I make Demand; “I bail the injur'd Stripling from thy Hand, “I take the Charge,—and here engage my Word, “To bring him, at thy legal Call restor'd. To whom, enrag'd the swelling Knight replies, “Go, take thy Bail,—but mark what I advise; “By that good Father's Soul from whom we came, “And by the Body of our honour'd Dame; “If Gamelyn comes not at th' appointed Day, “Thy Head the Forfeit of the Law shall pay.” Agreed, return'd Sir Otto, Knight, agreed, “I take thy Gage, be then our Brother freed! The Knight reluctant signs the Order due, The Brother hastens to his Gamelyn's View; Bears the glad Youth with fond Affection home, And chears him for the Dangers yet to come. Now Supper ended, o'er the genial Glass, As in Discourse the happy Hour they pass, Young Gamelyn thought on Empire left behind, And all the Picture glow'd within his Mind! “Brother, he said, the grateful Thanks I owe “Words faintly speak, but future Time shall show: “But needs I must with the returning Dawn “Visit my Men that range the flow'ry Lawn, “To see what good or ill my Friends betide, “Who sav'd my Life and chose me for their Guide. To whom, appall'd, return'd the honest Knight, “I like not, Gamelyn, this Design so right; “Thou know'st my Honour fetter'd in thy Cause, “Thou know'st the Ills on me thy Absence draws; “More generous then, for my Affection shown, “To leave me for thy Sake to be undone!” To whom the Youth,—“Sir Otto keep your Heart, “Nor yet distrust me, tho' I mean to part. “By conscious Heav'n, by Friendship here I swear, “Just to thy Promise shall I re-appear; “So Heav'n my Liberty and Life defend, “As never meant I to desert my Friend!” “Enough, I take thy Word, Sir Otto said, “Go see thy Forresters beneath the Glade; “Heaven shield thy Life from ev'ry threatned Ill, “And think on one whose Love attends you still. The orient Sun now shed his ruddy Ray, And Nature waken'd at the Sight of Day; When lonely to the well frequented Wood, The steady Youth his purpos'd Way pursu'd, And soon his stragling Forresters he spies, Who glad salute him with redoubled Cries; Soon thro' the Wilds the cheerful Notes are borne, And Crowds assemble to the regal Horn. Around their much lov'd Chief with Zeal they throng, And catch the Accents falling from his Tongue. Much of his Dangers, and Escape enquire, Lament his Absence, his Return admire. Show by their whole Deportment, how they love, And feast them with the Bounties of the Grove. Mean while the Knight, with a malicious Care, Studies the future Inquest to prepare: Some he secures with Gold, with Threat'nings some, And plans with Certainty a Brother's Doom. Nor Gamelyn thoughtless, in the secret Shade, Review'd the Danger threaten'd to his Head; He weighs the bold Design with mental Poize, His Men he hardens, and his Spies employs: Inform'd by them, he hears the Trial set, And vows to see the Court as soon as met, Determin'd, with returning Day to wait The Pow'r of Law, and throw the Dice of Fate. Now, Night advancing far her Influence shed, And the broad Moon illumin'd all the Glade; When to their Rendevouze the Archers come, And safe recline beneath the Sylvan Dome; When thus the Youth-“Ye Friends, inur'd to Arms, “Whom Friendship bends, and social Courage warms, “This Night your Arrows and your Bows prepare: “To morrow, nobler Toils demand your Care. “You know, my Honour is engag'd away: “You know, my Brother forfeits if I stay: “For Freedom, boldly let us draw the Sword, “Preserve my Friend, and justify my Word. With one Acclaim the Summons they return; All promise Faith, and for the Contest burn! Now thro' the Foliage pierc'd the Eye of Day, And dewy Di'monds spangl'd ev'ry Spray! The Monarch calls—his Subjects at the Sound, Arise and with uncommon Zeal surround. With careful Eye he marks the ardent Train; Then heads the March, and issues to the Plain. Full Six score Foresters attend behind, While the green Banner wantons in the Wind: Adam, with cautious Eye, the Rear intends, And to the Town the bold Procession bends. Full time it was: For, heavy now with Care, Sir Otto waited, fetter'd at the Bar. The wayward Knight, who found that Gamelyn fled, Resolv'd to take the Forfeit of his Head: For now the manag'd Inquest was enclos'd, To give the fatal Sentence he propos'd. Where Maidstone smiles in chrystal Medway's Tide, Arriv'd the Archer-Band, and noble Guide; Who, sudden halts, and from the circling Rear On Adam throws the Signal to appear. “From hence, he cries, I see the Sheriff's State; “E'en now, perhaps, my Brother tempts his Fate. “Do thou proceed, inform how matters stand; “Close shall I follow with my trusty Band. Observant Adam to the Hall repairs, Notes well the Scene, and back these Tidings bears, That on the Bench the envious Knight was plac'd, And at the Bar his Brother stood disgrac'd. “By Heav'n, inflam'd, the gen'rous Youth reply'd, “Well shall the Sheriff pay his new-blown Pride. To whom, said Adam, “If I counsel right “(So much thy Brother's Wrongs my Rage excite) “With Freedom should the Sword of Vengeance go, “Nor one, except Sir Otto, 'scape the Blow! “No, Adam, no, the gen'rous Youth reply'd, “Let Justice draw the Sword, but Reason guide. “Secure the Doors; let me survey the Hall, “And mark the Guilty, I have fix'd to fall. “I sit as Judge and Sheriff for this Day; “Be thou my Clerk—Good Adam, haste away! His Men determin'd seize on ev'ry Gate, While thro' the Crowd he bears his Brother's Fate, Views his deliver'd Friend with joyful Eyes, And from his Arms the shameful Bands unties. To whom Sir Otto, half with Transport dumb, Said, “Brother,—in a happy Hour you come; “Ev'n now the Inquest sit upon my Head, “And the perverted Law has doom'd me dead. “Not so, said Gamelyn, Brother, e're we dine, “Theirs be the Fate, which they intended thine! “Some others too, the Hand of Pow'r shall feel, “But foremost, he, from whom arose this Ill! Then to the Judge,—“Thou Pageant-Form, come down, “Justice by me disclaims thee for her Son: “For once I venture to usurp thy Place, “And save thy Sentence from its due Disgrace. The haughty Magistrate with Anger burn'd, Still kept his Seat, nor Answer least return'd; When Gamelyn's Arm, ascending to his Head, Beneath his Feet the frighten'd Victim laid: The Rooks of Pow'r, the servile Slaves of Law, Confus'd, the Insult on their Leader saw: But durst not move; for round the Archers stood, And each his Weapon held, prepar'd for Blood. Then rising to the ministerial Throne, His Hopes had compass'd, and his Valour won! Sir Otto by his side distinguish'd set, And Adam plac'd as Clerk, beneath his Feet. He calls his hardy Band with Voice severe, To bring the Judge and Sheriff to the Bar: Strait for th' impanell'd Quest he sends away, To join the Issue of the alter'd Day! Then from his Train he forms a new Assize, And tells them Justice on their Verdict lies. Their Verdict they return with equal Breath, And deem the Sheriff, Inquest, Judge to Death. Then round the Hall, confus'd Disorder spred, And all the Insolence of Pow'r was fled, As Vipers, clasp'd within the circling Cage, Between themselves exert their fruitless Rage; So pierc'd the Judge the Sheriff fetter'd views, The fearful Jury join in the Abuse. Their different Looks bespeak alternate Wrongs, And Eyes supply th' invective Wrath of Tongues. The Sheriff low for Gamelyn's Mercy cries, All Mercy the victorious Youth denies; “Twice have I prov'd, Sir John, your wretched Faith, “Twice hast thou doom'd me to inglorious Death; “But now I trust the present Hour my own, “Go thou, and count the Sands thy Glass must run! A new-made Gibbet had the Knight prepar'd, Nor guess'd, the Tree would be his own Reward. Forth lead the Archers the allotted Crew, While gathring Numbers flock the Scene to view. Then to the Stake the trembling Wretches bind, And leave their Forms to mingle with the Wind. So ended this malicious Knight his Days, In Falshood practis'd, and too proud with Ease, So Justice paid the long Arrears she cast, So fell a Father's Curse severe at last. So rose the Brave, the Innocent was freed, And dark Oppression met the Fate decreed. By Friends attended with disclosing Day, To Court the Victor Brothers shape their Way; By potent Friends was there Sir Otto lov'd, These he employs till Edward's Ear was mov'd. Pleas'd with the Tale (so Heav'n defends the brave) The generous Prince his gracious Pardon gave. The South of Trent, of all his Forest Land, Gave to the noble Youth the wide Command, And to his Service took his social Train, To guard his Conquests on the Gallick Main. So the brave Youth by prudent Valour led, His Lands recover'd and his Fortunes made; Thro' ev'ry Hardship still superior rose, True to his Friends, but fatal to his Foes! Preserv'd a faithful Brother's Span of Life, And doom'd to Death the Author of the Strife; 'Till Ease domestick softer Thoughts inspir'd, And Love assum'd the Breast Ambition fir'd; Then felt his yielding Heart the noblest Wound, Then Venus first the captive Warrior bound, From virtuous Eyes the Goddess threw the Dart, While equal Bosoms felt the pleasing Smart. By Hymen join'd they prov'd the gentle Flame; Their Joys, their Wishes, and their Souls the same, In honour'd Affluence they close their Days; Vice lords its Hour,—but Virtue lives on Praise. End of Gamelyn, or the Cook's Tale. PROLOGUE, TO THE Man of Law's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. Our Host, who view'd the Progress of the Sun, Judg'd to a Point how far he had to run; Found, they had us'd, to light them on their Way A Fourth and more of his Diurnal Ray: Whence, tho' not deep expert in learned Lore, No sage Astronomer cou'd gather more. Of April this he knew the eighteenth Day, April, the show'ry Messenger of May! And well he mark'd, that ev'ry Tree display'd, Proportion'd to it's Rise, a Fall of Shade; Whose Length was just in Quantity the same, As was erect the Body, whence it came. Hence cou'd he count, (nor vainly I admit, Tho' from a Shadow he assum'd his Wit) That now the Sun, who shone so clear and bright, Had reach'd his forty-fifth Degree of Height; And that the Hour was Ten, cou'd plain descry, No Astrolabe consulting, but his Eye. So suddenly, about he turns his Steed; “Proceed, he cries, for sake of Heav'n, proceed! “I warn you all, by Christ and by Saint John, “A Fourth already of the Day is gone. “It pains me to observe the Time you waste; “The Time, that flies away with winged Haste; “Can ought retard her, or in Durance keep? “She passes, tho' we wake, or tho' we sleep. “Swift as the Stream, that ne'er returns again, “Descending from the Mountain to the Plain. “'Tis wise, what one, call'd Seneca, has told; “That Loss of Time is worse than Loss of Gold! “Your Steed, tho' stole, again you may re-see! “The Day, that was, clos'd never more to Be! “No more to Be! than Malkin's Virgin Flow'r! “Shou'd Malkin lose it in a careless Hour. “Then let us use Dispatch. Sir Man of Law, “Give us a Tale, a Tale without a Flaw! “Acquit you of your Word, to join our Sport, “And think my Sentence, a Decree of Court. “You promis'd by my Judgment to abide.” ‘Brother, agreed! the Sergeant strait reply'd. ‘To break the Rule, I never once inclin'd; ‘A Word is binding, as a Parchment sign'd! ‘A Promise is an Obligation strong, ‘And may be term'd a Debt; a Debt of Tongue! ‘Besides such Law for others as we make ‘In Equity, from others we shou'd take. ‘This is my full Opinion on the Case; ‘This! tho' the Proof may bring me to Disgrace. ‘For not in Company to seem precise, ‘What pleasing Tale of Love should I devise? ‘Full, in my Way, our Chaucer stands alone, ‘All Ovid's Heroins has he made his own. ‘And if you miss them, I affirm it, Brother, ‘In one Book, you will find them in another. ‘Nay, many a Dame he adds to Ovid's Store, ‘Full many a gentle Dame that sigh'd of Yore! ‘New is the Language, tho' the Story old; ‘Nor will I tell again, what he has told. ‘Alcyone, in Youth, he made his Theme, ‘Warn'd of the Fate of Ceyx in a Dream. ‘And, grown to Age, he drew with bolder Pen, ‘The Praise of Women, wrong'd by faithless Men. ‘A large Collection, if you chuse to read! ‘Of injur'd Females, that lament, or bleed. ‘There may you see, how chaste Lucretia died, ‘The deadly Dagger plunging in her Side! ‘How Thisbe breath'd her Passion thro' the Wall, ‘And fell, since Pyramus was doom'd to fall! ‘How Dido rag'd, when false Æneas fled, ‘His Sword the sad Companion of her Bed! ‘Her Plaint how Phillis to Demophoon sends, ‘And high in Air her beauteous Form suspends! ‘The poison'd Gift how Deianira blam'd, ‘Nor wou'd have kill'd Alcides, but reclaim'd! ‘How wail'd Hermione her luckless Fates, ‘Forc'd, from the Man she loves, by him she hates. ‘Her golden Locks how Ariadne tore, ‘By Theseus left, on Naxos' desert Shore! ‘How Helen own'd a Pain, that damp'd her Joy, ‘The double Ill she brought to Greece and Troy! ‘Her Lord, how meek Briseis to reprove, ‘For that his Wrath was stronger than his Love! ‘How great Hypsipile makes humble Moan, ‘By Jason scorn'd, for all her Lemnian Throne; ‘Whose Heart Medea failing to retain, ‘She left him to deplore their Children slain. ‘How Hero plac'd the Love-alluring Light, ‘Thy Guide, Leander, thro' the stormy Night; ‘But when she spy'd thee, breathless on the Wave, ‘Down from her Tow'r she sought one wat'ry Grave! ‘How Laodamia urg'd her forceful Plea, ‘Care of thy self, oh! take, 'tis Care of me! ‘How Hypermnestra spar'd her Husband's Life, ‘And nobly lost the Daughter in the Wife! ‘How sage Penelope her Spouse incites, ‘He comes, who loves; Ulysses comes, not writes! ‘And how her Life Alcestes greatly ends, ‘To save her Lord, deserted by his Friends! ‘For virtuous Wives, as all the Fair attest, ‘Our Bard displays, and praises with the Best. ‘Yet never wou'd he write, nor cou'd approve, ‘How Canace indulg'd fraternal Love! ‘How Tereus rob'd a Sister of her Tongue; ‘Well by his Wife dismember'd for the Wrong. ‘How his own Tyro curst Salmoneus try'd; ‘How Byblis Caunus woo'd, too-near ally'd! ‘By Stealth how Myrrha with her Father lay, ‘But scarce escap'd his Rage at Dawn of Day! ‘How from Antiochus his Daughter fled, ‘Drag'd by the Hair to his incestuous Bed! These he omits, as Loves unworthy Praise; ‘Abominations foul of ancient Days! ‘What, from the Pen of easy Ovid, scapes, ‘Where, various Bodies change, to various Shapes; ‘Where ev'ry Age, is search'd, and ev'ry Clime, ‘To bring Creation down to Cæsar's Time. ‘Nor mean I here such Scandal to reherse, ‘Nor stain with such Impurity my Verse. ‘Verse, did I say, unpractis'd to compose! ‘My Prose accept, or Verse ally'd to Prose! ‘A Man of Law with Ease you will excuse, ‘If rude his Rhyme; Astrœa, is his Muse. ‘Little, she knows, to Periods what belongs, ‘Nor aims at Strains as soft as Ovid's Songs. ‘Yet shall she try, no Matter tho' she fail, ‘To tell of Love, a not dishonest Tale; ‘So, as when Philomela leaves to sing, ‘The Thrush presumes to hail the common Spring!’ Then smiling on our Host, with sober Cheer, He thus began, as you shall after hear. End of the Prologue. CONSTANTIA: OR, The Man of Law's TALE By Mr. BROOKE. Hence, Want, ungrateful Visitant, adieu, Pale Empress hence, with all thy meager Crew, Sour Discontent, and mortify'd Chagrin; Lean hollow Care, and self-corroding Spleen, Distress and Woe, sad Parents of Despair, With wringing Hands, and ever rueful Air; The Tread of Dun, and Bum's alarming Hand, Dire as the Touch of Circe's circling Wand, Keen Hunger with his sharp, but famish'd Eye, And dusky Theft, a desp'rate Prompter nigh, While Agues shudder to the whist'ling Gale, And jointly, Law and Infamy assail. But worse, oh worse, than all the hideous Train, Hot-mouth'd Reproach, and saucy writh'd Disdain; These in the Rear of thy Assembly wait, Still point the Anguish, and augment the Weight. The worst Oppression, who, ah who, could bear, If Virtue, hov'ring Angel, was not there? Where Poverty her blasting Progress bends, The Goddess with superior Wing attends. Around the Fair her blest Associates play, Bask in her Eye, and whiten in her Ray. Bright Purity, with firm unalter'd Cheek; The Mild, the Kind, the Gentle, and the Meek, Humility's benignly placid Grace, And Innocence with sweet seraphic Face; Calm Piety, that smiles amidst the Storm, And Charity with boundless Wishes warm. Bold in Front to guard the heav'nly Band, Behold the masculine Adherents stand! Patience with Atlantean Shoulders spred, Hail Temperance on thrifty Viands fed; Firm Fortitude, unknowing how to yield, And Perseverance with his batter'd Shield, And honest Industry, whose early Toil Wins Health and Plenty from the labour'd Soil. The genuine Arts behind the Goddess wait, Her Reign illustrate, and improve her State; With Eye elate here Contemplation soars, And Learning piles his intellectual Stores; Here mental Sciences arranging shine, Here manual Crafts the various Task design; While Diligence the busy Finger plies, And wing'd, from Rank to Rank, Invention flies; Such wide Extremes on Indigence attend, There Vice assails, the Virtues here defend; Below—the Gloom of ev'ry Passion storms; Above—calm Virtue mod'rates and reforms, Here, highly elevate—there deep depress, And give or Bliss,—or Anguish in Excess. Hail Virtue! chaste eternal Beauty, hail! Still on the Foe, O Goddess, still prevail; The World, e're fram'd, lay open to thy View; You form'd the Whole, and shall again renew: E're I thy arduous pleasing Toils decline, Be Want, ah, still be each Disaster mine, Till ev'n Oppression be it self subdu'd, Nor yet a Wish for Wealth, or Pow'r intrude. Nor be the Poor alone thy fav'rite Care; Fly, fly to Courts, and let the Mighty share: The Silken Lethargy at once awake, Debauch from his intemp'rate Opiate shake, Thence ev'ry Vice, and ev'ry Folly drive, That sting, or glitter round the gorgeous Hive; Before thy Touch let Insolence retire, And Vanity, an empty Breath, expire; Hipocrisy cast off the fair Disguise, And starting, in his native Gloom arise. Now, Goddess, entring, view the Dome of State, Do thou inform, and give me to relate; Let Demons obvious to my Eye appear, (Which known, could sure find no Admittance here) Amid the buzzing, busy, idle Croud, The mix'd Assembly of the Mean and Proud, See, Treason smiles, a Suitor to his King; See, Promise flutters on a Cypress Wing, Her Pinion like autumnal Foliage falls, And on the Pavement Disappointment crawls; A friendly Aspect Enmity assumes, Beneath Applause, deep lurking Envy glooms. The tempting Mammon Subornation shows, And in the Patriot's Zeal Dissention glows. Oppression there with gently winning Grace, And Ignorance with solemn thinking Face, And Pride with mortify'd and Christian Guise, And Infidelity with Saintly Eyes, Four Rival-Candidates, their Monarch sue; Two for the Bench, and for the Mitre Two. Lo there Ambition, from his Height elate! And Pleasure lolling on a Couch of State! On These the Pageantry of Pomp attends; To these the idolizing Tumult bends; The Poor, the Rich, the Peasant, and the Peer, And all Religions join in Worship here. Ambition reaching from his airy Stand, Grasps at a Globe that shuns his desp'rate Hand; Around the glitt'ring Sphere, confus'dly gay, Crowns, Truncheons, Gems, and trophy'd Radiance lay; But changing with alternate Light and Shade, The Lures appear, and vanish, shine, and fade; Vain as the cloudy Meteor of the Morn, Which Fancy forms, and transient Rays adorn. The prime Rewards four suppliant Sons of Fame, Lust, Rapine, Violence, and Slaughter claim; And tho' essential Happiness is due, For Toys the Wise, for Toys the Virtuous sue. Deluded Men, The ready Ambush fly! Dire lurking Deaths behind Ambition lye! The mourning Block, keen Axe, and racking Wheel, The poison'd Goblet, and the bosom'd Steel. Here Pleasure on her Velvet-Couch reclines, Smiles to undo, and in Destruction shines; With seeming Negligence displays her Charms; The Strong she withers, and the Steel'd disarms: Imagination, specious Handmaid, waits, And serves a Pomp of visionary Cates: The Sorc'ress still essays the fresh Repasts; But mock'd eternally, she feeds, and fasts. Around her Couch unnumber'd Vot'ries meet, And wish to share th' imaginary Treat; Devour each Morsel with desiring Eye, And for large Draughts of fancy'd Nectar sigh; A thousand Nymphs of wanton sprightly Mien, Trip round the Sofa, and amuse their Queen; With Transports she surveys the darling Train, All Daughters of her light fermenting Brain: Here Laughter, Mirth, and Dalliance unite, Illusive Joy, and volatile Delight, Conceits, Sports, Gambols, Titillations gay, Hopes that allure, and Projects that betray; Prime Sister of the inessential Bands, Erect, persuasive Expectation stands; On each Pursuit she flourishes with Grace, And gives a Butterfly to lead the Chace; Or wafts a Bubble on the parting Gale, And bids surrounding Multitudes assail; With Sweets the fond Pursuit alone is fraught, The Game still vanishes, when once it's caught: Vain is the Joy, but not the Anguish vain, And empty Pleasure gives essential Pain. Couch'd as a Tyger, watchful to surprize, Grim Death beneath the false Enchantress lies; The Fiends around invisibly engage, Guilt stings, Pains rack, and Disappointments rage; Aches, Asthma's, Cholicks, Gouts, Convulsions, Rheums, Remorse that gnaws, and Languor that consumes. Far other Train apparent Queen! you lead, True Bliss attends, tho' arduous Toils precede; Serene thy Bosom, tho' thy Brow severe, Pain points thy Path, but Heav'n is in thy Rear; Wondrous the Influence thy Pow'r supplies, Where Triumphs only from Oppression rise; Peace springs from Passion, and from Weakness Might; Calm Ease from Travel, and from Pain, Delight; No Sweets that vanish, and no Gusts that cloy, Clear is the Rapture, and serene the Joy; Reflection culls from ev'ry Labour past, And gives the same eternal Bliss to last. Thus by long Trial, and severe Distress, You Virtue truely, tho' severely, bless; Thro' each Tradition, each recording Page, Thro' ev'ry Nation, and thro' ev'ry Age; From purpled Monarchs, to the rural Hind, By Pain you purify'd, by Toil refin'd; The mightier Weight thy fav'rite Heroes bore, Chief you depress'd, whom chief you meant should soar, Still with the Foe, gave Forces to prevail, And with this Moral form'd the following Tale. While yet the Turk his early Claim avow'd, And rul'd, beneath his Scepter Judah bow'd; A Set of worthy, wealthy Merchants chose The World for Trade, and Sion for Repose. Here they select the Gems of brightest Rays, Rich Stuffs, wrought Silks, and Golden Tissues blaze; Thro' ev'ry Climate, and to ev'ry Gale, They launch the Cargo, and expand the Sail; Wide, with their Name, their Reputation grew, And to their Mart concurring Chapmen drew. The Lure of Novelty, and Thirst of Gain, Now points their Passage o'er the Midland Main: The Tiber now their spumy Keels divide, And stem the Flow of his descending Tide. To Rome, imperial Rome, the Traders came; Rome heard the Voice of their preceding Fame: Free Mart, and splendid Mansion she affords; Joy crown'd their Nights, and Elegance their Boards. With mutual Chat they gratify Desire; What's curious now relate, and now enquire; Alike for Knowledge, and for Wealth they trade, And are with Usury in both repaid. But Fame surpriz'd them with a Wonder new, Beyond what Times of brightest Record drew, The Poet's Fancy, or the Lover's Tongue; And thus the darling Excellence she sung. To crown our Monarch's Age with fond Delight, His Cares alleviate, and his Toils requite, Beyond whate'er paternal Wish could crave, Indulgent Heav'n a peerless Infant gave: The softer Sex her beauteous Body forms, But her bright Soul each manly Virtue warms; Youth without Folly, Greatness without Pride, And all that's firm, to all that's sweet ally'd. Rich as the Land by sacred Promise bless'd, Lies the fair Vale of her expanded Breast; Mild on a Parian Pillar turns her Head, Her Front, like Lebanon, divinely spred; There sit the Chaste, the Placid, and the Meek, And Morn smiles fresh upon her open Cheek. Babes learn Distinction at Constantia's Sight, And wither'd Age revives to strange Delight; Tumultuous Wishes breath along her Way, Hands rise, Tongues bless, and centring Eyes survey! All run to bend the voluntary Knee, The Blind to hear her, and the Deaf to see. Ah! were she born to universal Sway, How gladly would the willing World obey? And now with wealthy Manufacture stow'd, Launch'd on the Tide their freighted Vessels rode, The Pendants vainly point the fav'ring Gale, Court the weigh'd Anchor, and the op'ning Sail. Till first the fair Perfection they beheld, Who all Report (in fatal Hour) excell'd: For Syria then they ply the lab'ring Oar, And the crook'd Keels divide their native Shore. Exulting now they touch the fav'rite Land, Unlade, and moor along the yielding Strand. Now duteous, on their youthful Sultan wait, Unfold new Treasures, and new Tales relate. With usual Grace, and curious Ear he hears, With usual Courtesy, and Bounty cheers; The strange, the wondrous Narratives admires, And all that's foreign, all that's new requires. Ah, hapless Prince! thy farther Search restrain, Couch'd in the Tale, Death lurks to entertain; Constantia's Charms their raptur'd Tongues disclose, In ev'ry Word some kindling Beauty glows; Her Form, her Features, Mien, and Soul they breathe; Unpraise all Praise, and leave all Terms beneath. Strong Eloquence can picture to the Blind, Create new Forms, and people all the Mind; Can pain, or mitigate, can heal, or wound, Enchant with Sentences, and kill with Sound. The fancy'd Sweets his Ear impatient, drinks; Deep on his Soul the imag'd Beauty sinks; Thro' all his Thoughts, his Pow'rs, she lives, she reigns, Pants in each Pulse, and thrills along his Veins. Sure thro' the Tracts of yon' celestial Maze, Where mystic Planets dance, and Glories blaze; More Wonders typical impress the Sky, Than e'er was trac'd with Astrologic Eye: There, haply, e're his natal Hour express'd, First burn'd the Flame that glow'd within his Breast. There might the Nymph with previous Beauty bloom, With previous Languishment the Youth consume, Expire the Victim of successless Care, Die e're he liv'd, and e're he lov'd, despair. There the dear friendly Stream e're Julius bled, Great Brutus to his dearer Country shed; With destin'd Tyranny there Pride enslaves, With destin'd Virtue there the Patriot saves; There Pompey glow'd for Freedom and for Fame, There Socrates, of Greece the Pride and Shame: Alcides there each horrid Monster slew; There triumph'd Sampson, the heroic Jew; There All, or doom'd to save, or to destroy The Chiefs who fought at Thebes, or fought at Troy. Long mourn'd the Youth, with secret Woe opprest, The latent Vulture prey'd within his Breast; Constrain'd at length, nor able to sustain The wasting Malady, and mental Pain; The Sage, the bearded Pillars of his State, He calls, and privily unfolds his Fate; No Mean, he cries, my cruel Stars assign, Swift Death, or else Constantia must be mine. Alternate, each their Hopes, or Fears disclose, Invent, reject, and now again propose; While some with mystic Rites of wondrous Art, Engage to gain the sympathetic Heart; By philter'd Science, and infernal Charms, To win the bright Perfection to his Arms: Th' abhorrent Scheme his gen'rous Thoughts disdain, Resolv'd to die, or justly to obtain; And all their Arguments, howe'er renew'd, In Rites of Nuptial Sanctitude conclude. But here again new Obstacles appear'd, And much for this their latest Hope they fear'd; Fear'd, that Diversity of Faith, might prove Alike Diversity, and Breach in Love; Nor the fair Christian e'er consent to wed A Prince in Macon's sacred Precepts bred. “The Monarch then, ah! wherefore doubt my Friends, “Why yet dispute where Love and Life depends? “That Faith must sure, have most prevailing Charms, “That gives Constantia to my circling Arms; “No Obstacles shall bar, no Doubts deterr; “Nor will I think, that she was form'd to err.” The Voice determin'd, and imperial Eye, Leave no Pretence for Courtiers to reply: With the fond Speed of Love's Impatience warm'd, Now Embassies are sent, and Treaties form'd; All zealous to promote the Cause divine, The Pope, the Church, and Christian Pow'rs combine; The Royal, long-reluctant Parents yield, And Contracts are by mutual Proxy seal'd. High was the Trust the Regal Writings bore, And solemn the attesting Parties swore, That the young Syrian, and his Barons bold, Each Sex, and State, the Infant, and the Old, Should all Messiah's hallow'd Faith embrace, And bright Constantia be the Bond of Grace. We list not here of pompous Phrase to say, What order'd Equipage prepares the Day; Grooms, Prelates, Peers, and Nymphs, a shining Train, To wait the lovely Victim o'er the Main: All Rome attend in Wish the lovely Maid; And Heav'n, their universal Vows invade. At length the Day, the woful Day arrives, And ev'ry Face of wonted Cheer deprives; The fatal Hour admits no fond Delay, That shall the Joy from ev'ry Heart convey. Ye Men of Rome! your parting Glory mourn; Far from your Sight your Darling shall be torn: No more the Morn with usual Smiles arise, Or with Constantia bless your longing Eyes; Of ev'ry Tongue, of ev'ry Pen the Theme, The daily Subject, and the nightly Dream. But oh, Constantia! Say, thou fair Distress'd, What Woes that Hour thy lovely Soul possess'd? Its native Cheek the bright Carnation fled, And charg'd with Grief, reclin'd thy beauteous Head; To Lands unknown those Limbs must now repair, Nurs'd in the Down of fond paternal Care; Peace spread thy nightly Couch to sweet Repose, Delight around thy smiling Form arose, Each Scene familiar to thy Eye appear'd, And Custom long thy native Soil endear'd; Eas'd by thy Bounty, at thy Sight exil'd, Grief was no more, or in thy Presence smil'd, Each rising Wish, thy glad Attendants seiz'd, To give thee Pleasure, every Heart was pleas'd; But now to strange, to foreign Climes convey'd, Strange Objects must thy loathing Sense invade, Strange Features, to thy weeping Eyes appear, Strange Accents pierce thy undelighted Ear, In distant unacquainted Bondage tied, The gilded Slave of Insolence, and Pride, Perhaps of Form uncouth, and Temper base, Thy Lord shall clasp thee with abhorr'd Embrace. Thus fad the Fair revolv'd, soft Sorrows flow, And all her sighing Soul was loos'd to Woe, “Father! She cried, your fond, your wretched Child, “And You my Mother! You my Mother mild! My Parents dear, beneath whose kindly View, Bless'd by whose Looks, your cherish'd Infant grew, When far, O far, from your Embraces torn, Will you then think a Wretch like me was born? Shall then your Child some sad Remembrance claim? And some dear Drops embalm Constantia's Name? Your Face, (ah cruel Fortune can it be!) These Eyes shall never, never, never see; For ever parted by the rolling Main, I now must feel a lordly Husband's Chain; From ev'ry Friend, from every Joy remove, And the rough Yoke of rude Barbarians prove: But so may Heav'n the precious Issue bless, And all find Happiness through my Distress; Woman was doom'd ere yet the World began, The Prey of Sorrow, and the Slave of Man. She could no more, her Voice by Sobs supprest, And Tears pour'd forth in Anguish told the rest. Wide through the Croud the sad Contagion flew, Each hoary Beard is drench'd with mournful Dew, In short'ning Throbs ten thousand Bosoms rise, Grief show'rs its Tempest from ten thousand Eyes, Along the Shore the deep'ning Groans extend, And louder Shrieks the cloudy Concave rend; Not through old Rome when Desolation reign'd, And bleeding Senators her Forum stain'd, Not in the Wreck of that all dismal Night, When Ilion tumbled from her tow'ry height, Such utt'ring Plaints the deep Despair betray'd, As now attend the dear departing Maid. To the tall Ship with slow desponding Tread, All drown'd in Grief the beauteous Victim's led, She turn'd, and with an aching wistful Look, A long Farewel of every Field she took, Adieu! to all the melting Croud she cry'd; Adieu! Adieu! the melting Croud replied: Her launching Bark, the mournful Notes pursue, And ecchoing Hills return, Adieu! Adieu! Here let us leave the Virgin on the Main, With all her Peerage, and her pompous Train; To Syria let the swifter Muse repair, And say what Cheer prepares her Welcome there. The Dame, from whom his Birth the Prince deriv'd, Imperial Dowager, had yet survived, Ambitious, greedy of supreme Controul, And born with all the Tyrant in her Soul, At filial Government she long repin'd, Nor yet the Reins of secret Rule resign'd. Her savage Sentiments her Sex belie'd, And vers'd in Wiles with deepest Statesmen vied, Yet o'er her softning Tongue, and soothing Face, The subtle Varnish spread with easy Grace; The Sage discern'd, but still confess'd her Sway, And whom their Hearts detest, their Fears obey. Tenacious Zeal her Prophet's Lore revered, The Practice scorn'd, but to the Text adhered, And far as Faith with Fury could inflame, She was indeed a most religious Dame. When she her Son's determin'd Bent perceiv'd, Her Breasts with cruel Agitation heav'd, Her Call, each hoary, each experienc'd Friend, In Haste, and midnight Privacy attend; When dire, amid the dusky Throng she rose, And from her Tongue contagious Poison flows. “Ye Peers! ye Pillars of our falling State! “Too faithful Subjects of a Prince ingrate, “A Son, whom these detesting Breasts have fed, “A Serpent grown; to your Destruction bred; “Say, shall a single Hand such Patriots awe? “Insult your Prophet, and supplant your Law? First Heav'n! be all the Bonds of Nature broke, “E'er I assume the curs'd the Christian Yoke; “For, what import these innovating Rites, “But here a living Death of all Delights? “Such Threats, as Penitence can ne'er appease, “The Body's Penance, and the Mind's Disease? “Yet, were I of some faithful Hearts secure, “Not such the Malady, but we can cure.” She spoke, and all with swift Compliance swear, The glorious Deed with all their Powers to dare, Her Charge though ne'er so bloody to fulfill, Though ne'er so dang'rous to effect her Will. “Doubt not a Birth, she cry'd, so well conceiv'd, “Great Acts are more by Fraud, than Force atchiev'd; “To gain the Conquest we must seem to yield, “And feign to fly, that we may win the Field; “Let each in publick wear a Christian Face, “And counterfeit the saintly Signs of Grace, “What though our Skin the sprinkling Priest baptize, “Our Skin's unsullied, while our Hearts despise, “Not such the Tricks our bolder Hands shall play, “When Revels end the unsuspecting Day, “Nor such the Stream our purpling Points shall shed, “When we shall, in our Turn, baptize with Red. Ah Sex! still sweet, or bitter to Extreme, Gloomy as Night, or bright as Morning Beam, No Fiend may with a Female's Fraud compare, No Angel's Purity, like Woman's Fair, To save, or damn, for Bliss, or Ruin giv'n, Who has thee feels a Hell, or finds a Heav'n. Smooth as the Surface of the dimpled Main, While brooding Storms the gath'ring Ruin rein, Her Son, with dire dissembling Leer she seeks, And in the Depth of smiling Malice speaks. “My Child! tho' froward Age is over wise, “Let no Offence against a Parent rise, “Long Habits gain a Privilege from Time, “And frequent Custom mellows ev'ry Crime; “Repugnant hence I dar'd to thwart your Will, “I fear'd the Novelty, I fear'd the Ill; “But now convinc'd by Christ's superior Grace, “His Law I rev'rence, and his Faith embrace. “Bless'd be thy Bed! thy Bridal Transports bless'd! “Nor you refuse a Mother's fond Request, “Mine be the Joy to entertain the Fair, “To form the Festival be mine the Care, “To show the Peers who on thy Bride attend, “As she in Beauty, we in Love transcend.” The Royal Youth suspense in Wonder stood, Joy held his Voice, and Rapture thrill'd his Blood, Around her Knees his prostrate Arms he threw, And duteous Tears distill'd the grateful Dew; Her Son she rais'd, all innocent of Ill, And smiling kiss'd, whom soon she meant to kill. At length the Bride and all her solemn Train, Pass'd o'er the Danger of the Midland-Main; The Main is pass'd, but not the Danger o'er, The Sea less cruel than the Syrian Shore. Applauding Crouds the landed Beauty greet, And Judah's Peers in rich Procession meet, Great was the Throng, and splendid the Array, And Guards arranging lined the glitt'ring Way. Such were the Triumphs of Imperial Rome, When Conquest led some darling Victor home, While meeting Millions his Approach withstand, And Walls, and Trees, and clamber'd Roofs are mann'd. All gem'd in Ornaments of curious Mode, Gay in the Van, the false Sultana rode; Oft to her Breast she clasp'd the heav'nly Maid. And wond'ring oft with cruel Gaze survey'd. Last came the Sultan, royal, hapless Youth, Grace in his Form, and in his Bosom Truth, The last he came, for tim'rous Love controll'd, He fear'd, and long'd, and trembled to behold; A faint Salute his fault'ring Voice supply'd, Scarce, welcome! O! divinely Fair, he cry'd; He blush'd, and sigh'd, and gaz'd with wav'ring View, Nor dares to hope the blissful Vision true. Thus onward to a neighb'ring Town they far'd, In purpos'd Pomp, and regal State prepar'd; And here the old maternal Fiend invites, To order'd Feasts, and dearly bought Delights. Down sit the Guests, triumphing Clarions blow, Drums beat, Mirth sings, and brimming Goblets flow, In boundless Revel ev'ry Care is drown'd, And Clamour shouts, and Freedom laughs around. Ah hapless State! of ev'ry human Mind, Wrapt in the present, to the future blind; In the gay Vapour of a lucky Hour, Light Folly mounts, and looks with Scorn on Power. Nor sees how swift the Tides of Fortune flow, The swelling Happiness, and ebbing Woe; That Man, should ne'er indulge, or Bliss, or Care, The Prosp'rous triumph, or the Wretch despair, So close, so sudden each Reverse succeeds, And Mischief treads where-e'er Success preceeds. And now the Night with brooding Horrors still, Gloom'd from the Brow of each adjacent Hill, Slow heav'd her Bosom with distemper'd Breath, And o'er her Forehead hung the Weights of Death. Opprest with Sleep, and drown'd in fumy Wine, The prostrate Guards their regale Charge resign, But far within, still wakeful to Delight The Prince and Peers protract the festal Night; When from the Portal, lo! a sudden Gloom, Projects its Horrors through the spacious Room, Fearful and dark the ruffian Bands appear, The dire Sultana storming in the Rear. The bloody Task invading Treason plies, Quick, and at once alarm'd the Nobles rise, But These, as Faith or Faction led, divide, And Traitors most, with ent'ring Traytors side; Boards, Bowls and Seats o'erturn'd the Pavement strow. Of Blood, with Wine the mingling Currents flow; Vain is the Fear that wings their Feet for Flight, They fall who basely fly or bravely fight, With Screams and Groans the ecchoing Courts resound, And gasping Romans bite the trait'rous Ground. Say, Royal Syrian! in that Hour of Death, Say, didst thou tamely then resign thy Breath? Surprize and Shame, and Love and boundless Rage, Flash from his Eyes and in his Breast engage; Threatning aloft, his flaming Steel he drew, And swift to save his lov'd Constantia flew, Before his Bride a beauteous Bulwark stands, Now presses on, and backwards bears the Bands; Bold to his Aid surviving Romans spring, Some Syrians too could dare to join their King, Invaded late, they in their Turn invade, And Traitors are with mutual Death repaid. But what may Courage, what may Strength avail, Where still o'erpow'ring Multitudes assail? Where Number with encreasing Number grows, And ev'ry Sword must match a thousand Foes? As melting Snows with gradual Waste subside, So sink the Warriors from their Hero's Side; Thin'd are the Remnants of his bleeding Train, And scarce, but scarce th' unequal Strife sustain, Their Veins exhausted, and o'ertoil'd their Might, And strugling, but to fall the last, they fight. The Monarch thus on ev'ry side distress'd, And Hope extinguish'd in his valiant Breast, Turn'd to his Queen, he sent the parting Look, And brief th' eternal, last Adieu he took. “Since here, he cry'd, our hapless Loves must end, “Where this Arm fails, may mightier Heav'n defend: “This is my last, my only, fond Desire, “Too bless'd am I, who in thy Cause expire. So saying, with recruited Pow'rs he glows, Exalted, treads, and overlooks his Foes: Of more than mortal Size the Warrior seems, And Terror from his Eye imperial, streams. The circling Host his single Voice defies, Amid the Throng, with Fury wing'd, he flies; Deep bites his Sword, in Heaps on Heaps they fall, Hands, Arms, and Heads bespread the sanguin'd Hall, Untir'd with Toil, resistless in his Course, Disdain gave Fury, and Despair gave Force: As here, and there, his conqu'ring Steps he bends, Down his fair Form the purpling Stream descends, Exhausted Nature wou'd persuade to yield; But Courage still tenacious, holds the Field. As when the Lamp its wav'ring Light essays, The Source consum'd, that fed the vital Blaze, Extinguish'd now its kindly Flame appears, And now aloft a livelier Radiance rears; Subsides by Fits, by Fits again aspires, And bright, but doubtful, burn its fainting Fires; Till recollected to one Force of Light, Sudden she flashes into endless Night. So the brave Youth the Blaze of Life renews, Reels, stands, defends, attacks, and still subdues; Till ev'ry Vein, and ev'ry Channel drain'd, One last Effort his valiant Arm sustain'd: As Light'ning swift, he sped the latest Blow, And greatly fell, expiring on his Foe. As shou'd an Oak within some Village stand, Young, tall, and strait, the Fav'rite of the Land, Beneath the Dews of Heav'n sublime he grows Beneath his Shade, the Weary'd find Repose; To deck his Boughs, each Morn the Maidens rise, And Youths around his Form contest the Prize; Yet haply if a sudden Storm descend, Sway'd by the Blast, his beauteous Branches bend; But vig'rous, to their tow'ring Height recoil, Maintain the Combat, and outbrave the Toil; Till the red Bolt with level'd Ruin shoots, And nuts the pillar'd Fabrick from the Roots; Swift falls the Beauty o'er a Length of Ground, The Nymphs and Swains incessant mourn around. So did the Youth with living Form excell, So fair, so tall, and so lamented, fell; Relenting Traytors would revive the Dead, And weep the Blood their ruthless Weapons shed: One tender Pang the dire Sultana felt, And Nature, spite of Hell, compels to melt. While sudden thus each bloody Arm suspends, And round their Prince the satiate Tumult bends, Regardless of her Fate, Constantia goes Thro' pointed Javelins, and a Host of Foes; Amaze before the daring Virgin yields, And Innocence from ev'ry Weapon shields; Till mourning by the great Remains she stood, And o'er her Lover pour'd the copious Flood. “Ah, valiant Arm! a Waste of Worth in vain! “Ah, Royal Youth, she cry'd, untimely slain! “Oh! had I perish'd, e're I reach'd thy Shore, “The Surge devour'd, or watry Monsters tore, “To bless the World your Worth had yet surviv'd, “Nor I, too fatally belov'd, arriv'd. “Tis I, who have this dear Effusion shed; “For Me, for Me, a luckless Bride, you bled. So saying—furious, the Sultana cries. Strike; strike; the Source of all our Mischief dies;” Yes, strike, the bright, th' intrepid Maid replies. But vainly This consents, or That commands: Heav'n check'd their Hearts, and Pity bound their Hands; At once a thousand Javelins rise in Air; A thousand Wishes whisper,—ah, forbear; Recoiling Arms the bloody Task refuse, And Beauty with resistless Charm subdues. Alone, relentless, the Sultana cries, “'Tis well, the Death she wish'd, may still suffice: “Hence with that Form, that knows so well to reign, “Hence with the Witch, and plunge her in the Main; “Her Passage thence to Rome she may explore, “And tell her Welcome on the Syrian Shore. So saying, quick to a selected Band She gave to execute the dire Command; Reluctant to the Charge, they yet obey, And to the Shore the mourning Fair convey; Slow as she mov'd, soft Sorrows bathe the Ground, Her Guards too melt, and pitying weep around, Tho' vers'd in Blood, detest the stern Commands, And feel their Hearts rebellious to their Hands. When now upon th' appointed Beach they stood, That look'd with Horror o'er the deep'ning Flood. Each eyed his Fellow, with relenting Look, And Each to Each the cruel Task forsook; With distant Awe the heav'nly Maid survey, Nor once her Harm in Act or Thought essay. The still Suspence at length their Leader broke, And bow'd before the trembling Beauty, spoke. “O thou! endow'd with more than mortal Charms, “Who ev'ry Foe of all his Force disarms, “Say, how shall we our Pow'r or Will employ; “Where both are weak, to spare thee, or destroy? “Both impotent alike, our Pow'r and Will, “The Means to save Thee, or the Thoughts to kill? “Yet one Extreme may cruelly remain, “To yield Thee haply to the pitying Main, “And Heav'n, who form'd thee so divinely fair, “If Heav'n has Pow'r, will sure have Will to spare. He said; the rest assent, and to the Bay With secret Step the Virgin-Bride convey. Convenient here a Roman Bark they find, They hoist the hasty Canvas to the Wind: The Bark with Roman Wealth and Plenty stow'd, Now launching with the lonely Sailor rode; The Gale from Shore with ready Rapture blew, And to her Vessel bore the last Adieu. Now, stain'd with Blood, the self-convicted Night Fled from the Face of all-enquiring Light; And Morn, unconscious of the murd'rous Scene, O'er Syria, guilty Syria, rose serene. The Mountains sink before Constantia's Eyes, Wing'd o'er the Surge, her bounding Gally flies; From Sight of Land, and human Face conveys, The Skies alone above, and all around the Seas. “Go, lovely Mariner! Imperial Fair! “The warring Winds, and angry Ocean dare; “Strange Climes and Spheres (a lone Advent'rer) view, “New to the Main, and to Misfortune new; “Without the Chart, or Polar Compass steer, “Nor Storms, in which the stoutest tremble, fear. “But ill, those Limbs for gentle Office form'd, “And in the Down of nightly Softness warm'd, “Shall now, obsequious to the ruder Gale, “Command the frozen Cord, and pond'rous Sail; “Shall now, beneath the watry Sky obscure, “The nightly Damp, and piercing Blast endure. Thus all disconsolate, and sore distress'd, And Sorrow heaving in her beauteous Breast, Down sinks the Fair, her Hands in Anguish rise, And up to Heav'n she lifts her streaming Eyes. “O, Thou! she said, whence ev'ry Being rose, “In whom they safe exist, and soft repose; “Fix'd in whose Pow'r, and patent to whose Eye, “Immense, those copious Worlds of Wonders lye; “To me, the meanest of thy Works descend; “To me, the last of ev'ry Being, bend; “Since not exempt, in thy Paternal Care, “The lowest triumph, and minutest share. “Thy Subjects all, and all their Sov'reign know, “The Seas that eddy, and the Winds that blow; “The Winds thy ruling Inspiration tell; “The Seas, exulting in thy Presence swell: “O'er these, o'er those (Supreme) do thou preside; “For I desire no other Star to guide: “In Want, and Weakness, be thy Pow'r display'd, “And thou assist, where else no Arm can aid. “But if (as surely ev'ry Mortal must,) “If now I hasten to my native Dust, “From the dread Hour, and this devouring Deep, “The Spark of Deathless Animation keep, “Then may my Soul as bright instinctive Flame, “Aspiring then, thy kindred Radiance claim; “Or to some humbler Heav'n the Trembler raise, “Tho' there the last, the first to sing thy Praise; “Some lowly, vacant Seat (Eternal) deign, “Nor be Creation, and Redemption vain. So pray'd the Maid, and Peace, a wonted Guest, Sought the known Mansion of her spotless Breast; To ev'ry Peril arm'd, and Pain resign'd, Cheer in her Looks, and Patience in her Mind. The Wind fresh blowing from the Syrian Shore, Swift thro' the Floods her spooming Vessel bore; Long breath'd the Current of the Eastern Gale, And swell'd th' Expanse of each distended Sail; And now the Hills of Candia rise to View, As Ev'ning Clouds and settled Vapours blew; And now (still driv'n before the Orient Blast) Morea, and her length'ning Capes are pass'd: Now Land again her wistful Prospect flies, And gives th' unvarying Ocean to her Eyes; Till Malta's Rocks, emerging from the Main, The circling War of Earth and Sea maintain; Alike unknown, each varying Clime appear'd, The Land and Main alike the Virgin fear'd; While ev'ry Coast her wand'ring Eyes explore, Reminds her Soul of Syria's hostile Shore, And more than ev'ry Monster Seas can yield, From Man, from Man, she begs that Heav'n would shield, Full many a Day, and many a Night, forlorn, Thro' Shelves, and Rocks, and eddying Tempest born, Thro' drizling Sky, and nightly Damp severe, No Fire to warm, no social Face to cheer; On many a Meal of tainted Viands fed, The chill Blast whistling round her beauteous Head; The pensive Innocence attends her Fate, Amidst surrounding Deaths, and Storms, sedate. Ye silken Sons of Affluence and Pride! Whose Fortunes roll a soft superfluous Tide, Who yet on visionary Wants refine, And rack'd with false, fantastic Woes, repine; And Ye, whom Penury and sharp Distress, With bitter, but salubrious Med'cine bless; Behold that Sex, whose Softness Men despise; Behold a Maid! who might instruct the Wise Give Patience Precedent, fierce Frenzy swage, And with Philosophy new-form the Sage. For her the Tides of Regal Fulness flow'd; For her Oppression heap'd the cumbrous Load; In Affluence humble, in Misfortune great, She stands the worst Alternatives of Fate. At length, her Galley wing'd before the Blast, Swift launching, thro' the Straits of Ceuta pass'd; And winding now before the varying Gale, Tempestuous Auster rends her lab'ring Sail; Hispania's Realm th' obsequious Vessel coasts, Now Gallia's Surge the beauteous Burthen boasts; Till last, Britannia's Wave the Charge receives, And from th' Atlantic Main, exalting, heaves, The destin'd Freight with pleas'd Emotion bore, And gently wafted to Northumbria's Shore. But haply now 'twere obvious to demand, How borne from Solyma's far-distant Land, Thro' many a Clime, and Strait, that might restrain, The Gust of Winter, and the whelming Main. Britannia's Coast should fix the wandring Maid, Thro' such a Length of devious Tracts convey'd. “Say first when Ships in dizzy Whirlwinds wheel, “Who points the Fervour of the am'rous Steel? “Wing'd by whose Breath the bidden Tempest blow? “Heav'd in whose Fulness mighty Oceans flow? “Yet what are Winds that blow? or Seas that roll? “The Globe stupendous? or the poising Pole? “What the sev'n Planets on their Axis spun? “What the wide System of our cent'ring Sun? “A Point, an Atom, to the ambient Space, “Where Worlds on Worlds in circling Miriads race; “Yet these th' inanimate Volution keep, “And roll eliptic thro' the boundless Deep; “While one Hand weighs the infinite Suspence, “Th' insensate loads and measures the Immense; “Within, without, thro Heighth and Depth presides, “With equal Arm, the Bark, or Planet guides. “By Thee, uplifted thro' the pathless Skies, “With conscious Plume, the Birds of Passage rise; “Thro' Thee their patent Longitude is known, “The stated Climate, and the varying Zone. “Thy Will informs the universal Plan, “The Ways of Angels, and the Ways of Man; “The moral and material World connects, “Thro' Each (Supreme) both governs and inspects; “Conducts the Blood thro' each arterial Round, “Conducts each System thro' the vast Profound; “One Rule, the joint, the boundless Model, forms, “And the small Ant to love of Order warms; “Alike, thro' High, and Low, and Great, and Small, “Nor Aught's mysterious, or mysterious All. What Time the wafting Tide, and fav'ring Blast The Fair on Britain's fated Region cast; Young Alla then Northumbria's Sons obey'd, Whose substituted Scepter Offa sway'd. Illustrious Offa, who in Worth excell'd, Whate'er the Rolls of Saxon Heroes held; Alone Rodolphus, to the Chief ally'd, Excell'd in Arms, but much excell'd in Pride; High on the Brow of a commanding Steep, And full in Prospect of the Eastern Deep, His Seat, address'd for War, as for Repose, And fix'd with Elegance, brave Offa chose. And now the Hero, at his wonted Hour, Where Trees o'er-arching form'd the Sylvan Bow'r, With Hermigilda sought the Evening-Air, His Bride, the fairest of the Saxon Fair. When from the Main, and obvious to the View, Th' apparent Wreck their fix'd Attention drew, And quickly by innate Compassion led, Attended, to the neighb'ring Shore they sped: Constantia here sole Mariner they found, Admiring gaze, and silently surround: Her Eyes to Heav'n the grateful Charmer rais'd, And with mute Thanks of swift Acceptance prais'd; Then turn'd, with suppliant Mien her Arms extends, And lowly at their Feet for Mercy bends. Tho' Pagans, yet with native Virtues bless'd, The Sentiment humane inform'd their Breast: They, her sad Narrative of Woes enquire, Prompt to redress, as courteous to desire; With moving Eloquence the Maid began, And thro' a Length of strange Disasters ran; What Truth requir'd, with artless Grace reveal'd; What Prudence check'd, with graceful Art conceal'd, Pathetic gave her Suff'rings to the View; But o'er her State a specious Cov'ring threw. Sweet flow'd the Aceents of her gentle Tongue, Attention on the mournful Music hung: Each Heart a sympathetic Anguish felt, Who saw that Face, and could refuse to melt? Great Offa's Bride with answ'ring Woes distress'd, With streaming Eyes, and clasping Arms caress'd; Officious now, to please, and prompt to aid, They to the Palace lead the peerless Maid; With Feast, and Song, and social Aspect cheer, And, as of more than mortal Mold revere. Here, pleas'd with Privacy, and long Content, Her Days the universal Charmer spent; To Office apt, and each obliging Art, She kindly stole the voluntary Heart; Ador'd around, a mental Empire gain'd, And still a Queen thro' ev'ry Bosom reign'd. What winning Pow'r on Beauty's Charm attends The Rude it softens, and the Bigot bends. What Precept from Constantia's Lips can fail? What Truth so musical, and not prevail? Persuasive while she pleads, the Priest might learn, The Deaf find Ears, and ev'n the Blind discern; Soon thro' the House of gen'rous Offa spred, Her pleasing Tongue its sacred Influence shed; And all the cordial Proselytes of Grace, The Christian Law, the Law of Love, embrace. But ah, sweet Maid! how short is thy Repose! Nor hope that here thy Scenes of Suff'ring close; Heav'n speeds the Planet that o'erul'd thy Birth, And hastes to make one Angel, ev'n on Earth. Rodolphus to the Saxon Chief ally'd, Whose Strength of Limb with mightiest Giants vy'd, Of Feature crude, and insolent of Soul, Whose Heart nor knew, or Mercy, or Controul, He saw, and though to Deeds of Discord bred, He saw, and on the lovely Vision fed, Swift through his Veins the sulph'rous Poison run, But Women seem'd all obvious to be won. Malicious Fervour prompts him to enjoy, Dire is the Love that's eager to destroy, Vows, Pray'rs, and Oaths, and Menaces he try'd, And priz'd alike the Prostitute, or Bride; But when repuls'd with merited Disdain, He found all Threats, as all Intreaties vain, The Flame that gloomy in his Bosom burn'd, To deadly Hate by swift Transition turn'd, And nightly, in his dark designing Soul, Dire future Scenes and Schemes infernal roll. Mean time, the Sons of hostile Scotia arm, And Fame through Albion gives the loud Alarm, Young Alla at the warlike Call arose, And speeds with answ'ring Boldness to oppose, While Offa with glad Heart, and Honours due, To welcome his approaching Sov'reign flew. And now Rodolphus of whose baleful Breast The Fiends and ev'ry Fury stood possess'd, On Ills of cruellest Conception bent, To perpetrate his deadly Purpose meant. All wrapt in Clouds, from Heav'ns nocturnal Steep, Mid Darkness hung, and weigh'd the World to sleep. When Offa's Consort, and the Roman Maid, By unsuspecting Innocence betray'd, Divinely pious, and divinely fair, Tir'd with long Vigil and the nightly Pray'r, Together lock'd in calm Oblivion lay, Not both to rise and greet returning Day. Rodolphus unperceiv'd, invades the Room, His Bosom darker than the midnight Gloom, Dire o'er the gentle Fair the Felon stands, A Ponyard thirsting in his impious Hands. As should some Cottager with hourly Care Two Lambs, his sole Delight and Substance, rear, With Fondness at his rural Table fed, Beneath his Eye, and in his Bosom bred, Till fierce for Blood, and watchful to devour, Some prowling Wolf perceives the absent Hour, His nightly Tread through some sly Postern bends, And the meek Pair with savage Fury rends; So sweet, so innocent, the Fair Ones lay, So stern, the human Savage views his Prey, His Steel swift plung'd through Hermigilda's Breast, From the pure Form, dismiss'd the purer Guest; Without one Sigh her gentle Soul expires, And wak'd in Bliss, the wond'rous Change admires, Beyond, beyond what Utt'rance e'er can name, Or Vision of ecstatic Fancy frame. Not so, bright Maid! thy harder Fate intends, A simple Death was only meant for Friends, For thee, he hoards the Fund of future Ill, And spares with tenfold Cruelty to kill. Close by Constantia, lovely sleeping Maid, His reeking Steel the murd'rous Ruffian laid, Revolv'd within his Breast new Mischiefs brew, And smiling horridly, the Fiend withdrew. Thick Darkness yet withstood approaching Day, And camp'd upon the Western Summits lay, And scarce the straggling Rays of orient Light, Excursive, pierc'd the paler Realms of Night, Their Passage through Constantia's Casement won, And view'd the brightest Form beneath the Sun, When the first Glories of her op'ning Eyes With prompt, with early Elevation rise, Its Wing tow'rds Heav'n her waking Soul extends, And in a Rapsody of Praise ascends. But ah not long those lively Transports burn, Confus'd, alarm'd, her Thoughts to Earth return, All chill, and in the vital Current drown'd, Pale at her Side, her lovely Friend she found, A Cloud of Horror quick involv'd the Fair, And utt'ring Shrieks express'd the loud Despair, Wak'd to her Griefs, the scar'd Domestics rose, In rush'd the Train, shrill echoing to her Woes, O'er the pale Dame a mourning Torrent shed, And with repeated Cries invoke the Dead; Rodolphus too, with well-dissembled Fears, And Face of busie, feign'd Concern, appears, From Heav'n's high Wrath, with swift Perdition sped, He calls down Vengeance on the guilty Head; Apparent Zeal his earnest Visage fires, And (loud) the Murd'rer for himself enquires. With bloody Marks of dire Conjecture stain'd, Constantia, hapless Virgin, stands arraign'd: The Fair with Fears her guiltless Cause essays; But ah! each specious Circumstance betrays. Rude Cords around her polish'd Arms they strain, Strong pleads the Innocent, but pleads in vain. Far were thy Friends, Constantia! lovely Maid! Far distant all, that had the Pow'r to aid; From Guilt, from Death, from Infamy to save, Or shed a Tear upon a Stranger's Grave. And now the Tale, with deadly Tid'ngs fraught, To Offa's Ear a speedy Courier brought. Heart pierc'd with Anguish, stood the mourning Chief, No Plaints express'd th' inutterable Grief; No Sighs exhale, no streaming Sorrows flow, Fix'd and immoveable in speechless Woe. Compassion touch'd the gen'rous Alla's Breast, For his brave Subject, for his Friend distress'd; Each Circumstance the Royal Youth enquires, And the dire Act his just Resentment fires. By specious Proofs of false Suggestion led, He vows full Vengeance on Constantia's Head, To doom the luckless Innocent he speeds, And in his Wrath the previous Victim bleeds. Fame flies before with voluntary Wing, A thousand distant Shouts proclaim their King; Pour'd from all Parts, the Populace unite, And on his Form insatiate feed their Sight: For Alla, bright in each Perfection, shone, That grac'd the Cottage, or enrich'd the Throne: The Nerve-Herculean brac'd his youthful Arm, His Cheek imbib'd the Virgin's softest Charm: Mild was his Soul, all spotless as his Form, His Virtues not severe, but chaste and warm; His Manners sweet and sprightly, yet sincere; His Judgment calm and deep, yet quick and clear: Graceful his Speech, above the Flow'rs of Art; Open his Hand, more bounteous yet his Heart; As Mercy soft, kind, social, and humane; Vice felt alone, that Alla held the Rein. To all the Pride of Courts, and Pomp of Show, The brightest Ornament, yet greatest Foe. Within, without, thus rich in ev'ry Grace, And all the Angel in his Soul, and Face, Not form'd to feel Love's Passion, but impart, No Charms were yet found equal to his Heart: For him each Virgin sigh'd, but sigh'd in vain, By him unpitied, since unknown the Pain. Detesting Flattery, yet fond of Fame, Thro' deadly Fields, he sought a deathless Name; Still foremost there, he sprung with youthful Heat, And War, not Love, gave Alla's Breast to beat; Each Foe he conquer'd, and each Friend retain'd, And scepter'd in his Subjects Bosoms, reign'd. And now arriv'd—severe in solemn State, (Whence no Appeal) the grand Tribunal sate; Great Alla, thron'd conspicuous to the View, Attention, Love, and cent'ring Rev'rence drew; In Form, the deadly Process strait began, Wide thro' the Croud, a doubtful Murmur ran, Rodolphus chief the friendless Pris'ner charg'd, Enforc'd the Pain, and on the Guilt enlarg'd; The Fair unknown to her Defence they cite, Guarded she comes, as pure, as Angels bright; As tho' Delight and Grief at once combin'd, And fled to her, displeas'd with all Mankind, Or as Delight would Grief, in Grief, excell, Or Grief could find Delight with her to dwell. Pensive she moves, majestically slow, And with a Pomp of Beauty decks her Woe: All Murmurs silenc'd by her Presence, cease, And from her Eye the yielding Croud gives place; Ev'n Alla's Looks his softning Soul confess'd, And all Resentment died within his Breast. But ah! while Shame with injured Honour vies. And yet her Tongue its fault'ring Task denies, More than all Phrase, or studied quaint Address, Her down-cast Eyes, and speaking Looks express. At length pathetic, with a starting Tear, She thus to bow'd Attention charm'd the Ear. “Where may the Wretched for Protection bend? “Or when, ah when shall my Misfortunes end? “Sure, Persecution in the Grave will cease, “And Death bestow, what Life denies me, Peace. “Driv'n from before the Face of Humankind, “Earth, Air, and Sea, with cruel Man combin'd: “Each Hour, each Element prepar'd a Foe, “And Nature seem'd exhausted in my Woe: “At length with ev'ry Grace and Virtue crown'd “One Friend, one pitying faithful Friend I found, “With her (retir'd) to pass my Days I chose, “And here presum'd to taste a late Repose: “But Peace to me, alike all Climes refuse; “And Mischief to the farthest Pole pursues, “'Tis even a Crime to be Constantia's Friend, “Nor less than Death to those who wou'd defend, “Ah Hermigilda! cou'd my forfeit Life, “To the fond Husband give the faithful Wife, “From Death recall thy chastely featur'd Charms, “And yield thee to the gen'rous Offa's Arms, “Ah! gladly wou'd I then resign my Breath, “If Life so dear cou'd be reviv'd by Death. “But thus to die with soul Suspicion stain'd, “For Murder, Murder of my Friends arraign'd! “Alas! unskill'd in ev'ry cruel Art, “Had I the Power to hurt, I want the Heart; “No Creature e'er Constantia's Malice felt, “Ev'n suff'ring Foes have taught my Heart to melt, “My Heart, for Birds, for Insects oft distress'd, “And Pity is its known, its only Guest. “O Youth! thy happy People's boasted Theme, “O Alla, sacred to the Breath of Fame, “To whom subjected Realms their Rights submit, “Who thron'd in Judgment like an Angel sit, “Still more extensive be thy guardian Care, “And let the Innocent, the Stranger share.” Here rudely on her Plea Rodolphus broke, And all inflam'd, and interrupting, spoke. “List not, O King, to that bewitching Tongue, “So sweetly false the tempting Syrens sung, “Her Words wou'd give the knotted Oak an Ear, “And charm the Moon from her enchanted Sphere. “That by her Hand our dear Relation bled, “This Sword shall witness on her guilty Head, “Whatever Champion, or bold Odds oppose, “And, arm'd by Justice, dare a thousand Foes, “Then be her Purity by Combat try'd, “And by the conquering Arm let Heav'n decide. Alas! O Alla, (cry'd the trembling Maid) “My Sex, not Arms but Innocence must aid, “Helpless I stand, and distant ev'ry Friend, “That has the Pow'r, or Courage to defend; “If Justice is ordain'd to crown the Strong, “Then the weak Arm is ever in the Wrong, “The Hawk may triumph in his lawless Deeds, “While doom'd beneath his Gripe the Turtle bleeds “Yet that I'm guiltless ev'n my Charge admits, “And Malice, meaning to arraign, acquits, “What tho' the Sword lay treach'rous at my Side; “Sure Guilt could never want the Craft to hide; “The Spots of bloody Circumstance explain, “That inward Truth fears no exterior Stain; “And last my Capture with the Slain implies, “That Guilt, not Innocence from Vengeance flies. “I fear not Death but that surviving Shame, “Which must to Ages blast my spotless Name, “Be that from Taint of guilty Censure freed, “And all that Malice can inflict, decreed.” Thus while she spake, with secret Passions toss'd, And in a World of new found Wonders, lost, Scarce Alla could his struggling Heart controul; Fix'd were his Eyes, but restless was his Soul, His Breast with various Agitation burn'd, Now pale, now red, his varying Aspect turn'd, Her Accents dwell upon his list'ning Ears, When now she ceas'd, delighted still he hears, Her Form with chang'd, with fev'rish Look surveys, And could for ever hear, for ever gaze. At length collected, as from Bonds he broke, And with cold Speech, and feign'd Indiff'rence, spoke. “Thy Charge, (bright Maid) my secret Soul acquits, “But publick Law no private Voice admits, “Kings sit not here, with arbitrary Sense “To form new Laws, or cavil, but dispense; “Though Law is fallible, yet Law should sway, “And Kings more fallible than Law, obey. “Say, gallant Warriors! who unmatch'd in Arms, “May yield uncensured to resistless Charms, “Say, is there one who singularly brave, “At his own Peril greatly dares to save, “From Pain, from Death, from Slander to defend, “And give the Stranger, and the Fair, a Friend. The Hero said, but mute was ev'ry Tongue, Blank ev'ry Face, and ev'ry Nerve unstrung, So much Rodolphus, never match'd in Arms, Each weaker Hand, and conscious Heart alarms; So was the Giant fam'd for brutal Pow'r, Strode like an Arch, and menac'd like a Tow'r. Then Alla “Soon as Phosphor's dewy Ray “Shall gild the Shade, bright Promiser of Day, “Prepar'd and meted with the Morning Light, “Be the rail'd Barrier, and the Lifts of Fight, “Then, e'er the Sun swift mounting up the Sky, “Views the wide World with his Meridian Eye, “While issuing from the Trumpets brazen Throat “Defiance loudly breaths its martial Note, “If haply Heav'n (not impotent to aid) “With interposing Arm protect the Maid, “Some Angel, or unlook'd for Champion send, “And with prevailing Ministry defend, “Freed be the Fair, and spotless be her Fame, “E'er Evening else, she feeds the hungry Flame.” So spake the Prince, descending from his Throne, Sad through the Concourse went the length'ning Groan, The Maid to Death inevitably doom'd A guiltless Victim ev'ry Heart presum'd, To her they consecrate the pitying Tear, Nor e'er till then cou'd think their Prince severe. Constantia (when with firm tho' hopeless Eye She now perceiv'd the fatal Hour drew nigh) In conscious Innocence erects her Head, With Doubt exiled, all Care and Terror fled, Death stole from Triumph to adorn her State, And gave a Smile beyond the Reach of Fate. All Night in Pray'r and mental Song the Maid (With Angels choir'd) her Soul for Heav'n array'd, Light from her Heart as Summer's careless Robe, Dropt each Affection of this Sin-worn Globe, O'er Honour, late so lov'd, o'er brutal Foes, And ev'ry Sense of mortal Coil she rose, Till tow'rd the Dawn she gently sunk to Rest, With all Elysium open'd in her Breast. Gray Morning now involv'd in rising Dew, Over the cap'd Hills her steaming Mantle threw, While far beyond the Horizontal Sun, With Beam of intersected Brightness shone, Gold pav'd o'er Ocean strech'd his glitt'ring Road, And to the Shore the lengthning Radiance glow'd. Full in his sight, and open to the Main, Concurring Squadrons throng'd Northumbria's Plain, To learn what Fate attends the foreign Fair, Each Sex and Age in mingling Routs repair, Whom pour'd by Millions to the listed Field, Dispeopl'd Towns, and emptied Hamlets yield. Within the Lists, conspicuous to the sight, Rode the proud Stature of the Saxon Knight, His Mien, with Thirst of Opposition fir'd, Appear'd to menace what it most desir'd, Gave all to wish some Champion for the Fair, Gave all to wish the Fight, but none to dare; His bold Defiance o'er the measur'd Ground, The brasen Blasts of winding Clarions sound, While strong lung'd Heralds challenge to the Fight, And seem at once, to threaten, and invite. And now, expectant of the murd'rous Flame, In sable Pomp the lovely Victim came, On her, all Looks, and cent'ring Hearts were fix'd, Love, Grief, and Awe, with soft Compassion mix'd, To Heav'n, the Voice of wide Affliction cries, Earth drinks the Tribute of ten thousand Eyes, Such Sighs as from the dying Breast expire, And Tears, as meant to quench a World on Fire. To the tall Pyre, in sad Procession led. The Maid tranquil ascends her Sylvan Bed, And fearless on the Funeral Summit plac'd, Her Seat, of fearful Preparation, grac'd. Hence, with wide Gaze she threw her Eyes around, Nor Alla, cruel, lovely Alla, found; “Ah (soft she said) where's this Heroic Youth? “So fam'd for Clemency, so fam'd for Truth, “So sage, so cautious in the Casuist's Chair, “Too firm to deviate, and too just to spare, ‘To Strangers cruel, tho' to Subjects kind, ‘In Law discerning, yet to Mercy blind. ‘Why comes not he to feast his savage Eyes? ‘And view the Pains he can so well devise, ‘Heav'n fram'd thee Alla with exterior Art, ‘Soften'd thy Form, but left a flinty Heart, ‘Too perfect else had been the beauteous Plan, ‘And Alla had been something more than Man. Thus while she spoke, a distant Murmur rose, As when the Wind thro' rustling Forest blows, And gathering now still louder and more near, To mute Attention turn'd each list'ning Ear. Distinctly heard along the listed Ground, To Trumpets, now shrill answering Trumpets sound, A clam'rous Cheer from Rank to Rank extends, And sudden shout the deafen'd Welkin rends. Strait (usher'd to the Field with loud Acclaim) A Knight unknown, and unattended came, No trophy'd Boast, no outward Shine of Arms, Nor love Device, with quaint Attraction, charms; Unplum'd the Motion of his sable Crest, And black the guardian Corselet on his Breast, Black was the Steed that bore him to the Field, And black the Terror of his ample Shield. As when to Slake Jernes' fev'rish Plain, And check the Dog-star's short, but sultry Reign, A Cloud, full-freighted with the coming Storm, Black-brow'd o'er Ocean lifts its cumb'rous Form, Dread, to the Shore its gloomy Progress bends, And charg'd with Heav'n's avenging Bolt suspends. So to the Field the gloomy Champion show'd, So charg'd with Mercy, as with Vengeance rode. Where the bright Victim bless'd the circling View, Close to the Pyre the sable Warrior drew, Guilty aloud? Or Innocent? He cry'd, Ah guiltless-so help Heav'n, the Maid reply'd, So by this Arm (he said) may Heav'n for thee decide! Surpriz'd Rodolphus stood, abash'd the bold, And like a Torrent in mid Course controll'd, Abash'd to find, that any mortal Wight, Cou'd singly dare to match his matchless Might. But soon, of conscious Force, and Scorn, and Pride, With two-fold Fury swell'd th' impetuous Tide, Resistless, dreadful, in his Wrath he rose, For Courage still with Opposition grows. Attending Heralds strait divide the Field, And the dire Interval for Combat yield. To either Gole retir'd each threatful Knight, Fierce thro' Restraint, and trembling for the Fight, On each by Turns was ev'ry Look intent, Now here, now there, with swift Emotion bent; Perch'd on the Summit of the Stranger's Crest, Here Conquest seem'd to ev'ry Eye confest; Not long confess'd, for from his Rival, there, Again the varying Judgment learns Despair, For ev'ry Wish assum'd the Stranger's Part, And quick Expectance throb'd in ev'ry Heart. Fix'd in his Seat, each waits the dread Career, And in each Rest firm sits the pond'rous Spear, Each conscious Steed impatient beats the Ground, Eager and wan was ev'ry Face around; The Signal given, they vanish from the Goles, Earth backward spurn'd from either Courser rolls, Space gathers quick beneath their nimble Feet, And Horse to Horse, (tremendous Shock) they meet. Nor yet blind Wrath, or head-long Valour rul'd, More forceful was their Force, by Judgment cool'd, The deadly Aim each hostile Eye selects, Each Eye too marks where either Arm directs, With Art they ward, and with dread Action wield, Point with the Lance, and parry with the Shield. Full at the Bosom of his active Foe Rodolphus levell'd the resistless Blow, But from his oblique Buckler glanc'd the Spear Which else, nor Targe, nor mortal Arm could bear Not so his Lance the sable Champion sped, Feign'd at the Breast, then brandish'd at the Head, Thro' his Foe's Shield the verging Weapon press'd, And raz'd the Plume that wanton'd on his Crest. Together, with impetuous Onset push'd, Thus Horse to Horse, and Man to Man they rush'd; Then backward, driv'n by mutual Shock they bound, Beneath the Conflict shakes the suff'ring Ground. So wing'd, in War, or Darkness, on the Deep, Two Ships adverse the mediate Ocean sweep, With horrid Brunt joins each encount'ring Prow, Loud roars the rifled Surge, and foams below, Sails, Shrowds, and Masts all shiver in the Toil, And backward to their Sterns the found'ring Keels recoil. But each well skill'd in ev'ry warlike Meed, New to the Charge revives his sinking Steed; Swift from his Side his steely Terror drew, And on his Foe with answ'ring Fury flew. The Sway long time intemp'rate Valour bore, While artless Rage unlearn'd the Warrior's Lore; On their hack'd Arms the restless Peal descends, Targe, Plate, and Mail, and riven Corselet, rends; Struck from their Helms, the steely Sparks aspire, And from their Swords forth streams the mingling Fire. As in the Glow of some Vulcanian Shed, Two brawny Smiths heave high the pond'rous Sled, Full Front to Front, a griesly Pair, they stand, Between their Arms extends the fiery Brand, Huge Strokes from the tormented Anvil bound; Thick flames the Air, and groans the lab'ring Ground, So toil'd these Heroes with commutual Rage, And such reciprocated Combat wage. Around them (trembling) Expectation waits, With speechless Horror ev'ry Bosom beats, For either seem'd resistless in the Fight, But each too seem'd to match resistless Might. Surpriz'd at length the wary Warriors own A Rival to their Arms till then unknown, With mutual Wile defensive, now they fought, And mutual Wounds a mutual Caution taught. All Dint of Force, and Stratagem, they try, Reach with their Arms, and measure with their Eye, They feint, they ward, strike out, and now evade, Foin with the Point, and parry with the Blade, Probe each Defect, some purpos'd Limb expose, Now grapling seize, and with dread Union close, Their Waistes with unenamour'd Grasp they wind, Their Arms, like Cramps, and forceful Engines bind, Each strives to lift the other from his Seat, Heav'd thick, and short, their lab'ring Bosoms beat; Struggling they gripe, they pull, they bend, they strain, But firm and still unsway'd their Seats retain; Till loos'd as by Consent again they turn, And with reviving Force and Fury burn. Thus future Ages had this Fight beheld, Where both all Might excelling, none excell'd. Had not Rodolphus with impassion'd Pride, High heav'd a Blow that shou'd at once decide, (His utmost Pow'rs collected in the Stroke) Like Thunder o'er the yielding Foe he broke; (The Foe elusive of the dire Intent) His Force in Air the barrass'd Pagan spent, And by his Bulk of cumb'rous Poise o'ersway'd, Full on his Helm receiv'd the adverse Blade, Prone fell the Giant o'er a Length of Ground, With ceaseless Shouts the echoing Heav'ns resound. As from the Brow of some impending Steep, The sportive Diver views the briny Deep, From his high Stand with headlong Action flies, And turns his Heels retorted to the Skies; Inverted so the bulky Chief o'erturns, And Heav'n, with Heel of quick Elation, spurns. Light from his Steed the conqu'ring Hero sprung, And threatful o'er the prostrate Monster hung, He, with feign'd Penitence, and humbled Breath, Fond to evade the fear'd, th' impending Death, (The instant Weapon glitt'ring at his Breast) The murd'rous Scene and nightly Guilt confess'd. Mean while, attended by the shouting Crew, The Fair, now free'd, to greet her Champion flew; For not of mortal Arm the Chief she thought, But Heav'n's own Delegate with Vengeance fraught. When now, enchanting to the Warrior's Sight, The Maid drew near, the Maid as Angels bright, His Bever from his lovely Face he rais'd, And All on Alla, conquering Alla, gaz'd. Earth, Sea, and Air, with endless Triumph ring, And shouting Thousands hail their Victor King. Not so Constantia, struck with strange Surprize, Her great Deliverer in her Judge she eyes, Conquest and Love upon his Regal Brow, A cruel Judge, but kind Deliv'rer now, Soft Shame, and trembling Awe, her Step, repress'd, And wond'rous Gratitude disturb'd her Breast; Joys, fainting Fears, quick thrill'd through ev'ry Vein, And scarce her Limbs their beauteous Charge sustain. How widely devious from the Ways of Man Is the great Maze of providential Plan! Vain Man, short-sighted Politician, dreams, That Things shall move subservient to his Schemes, But Heav'n the fond Projector undermines, And makes the Agent thwart his own Designs, Against it self the Instrument employs And with the Means the End propos'd destroys. What shall prevent Omniscience to direct? And what, what can't Omnipotence effect? He to th' Event subdues th' opposing Cause, And Light from Darkness, (wond'rous Influence) draws, Defeat from Conquest, Infamy from Fame, And oft to Honour paves the Path of Shame. Why then this Toil, and Coil, and anxious Care? Why does Man triumph, why does Man despair? Why does he chuse by vicious Steps to scale, Where Virtue may (at least as well) prevail, Since not in him his proper Fortune lies, And Heav'n alone ordains his Fall, or Rise; Man may propose, but only Heav'n must speed, And tho' the Will is free, th' Event's decree'd. Be then the Scope of ev'ry Act, and Thought, To will, and do still simply as we ought, The less shall Disappointment's Sting annoy, And each Success will bring a double Joy; To boundless Pow'r and Prescience leave the Rest, But Thou, enjoy the Province in thy Breast. Lo! in one Hour, by Fortune unforeseen, The lowly Criminal becomes the Queen; From Shame to Glory, Anguish to Repose, From Death to Life, and Bonds to Freedom rose. In Love, as War, resistless, Alla woo'd, And whom he won by Arms, by Suit subdu'd, Constantia with her secret Wish comply'd, For Alla would not, could not be deny'd. Nor list we here with Pomp of long Array To blazon forth that chaste connubial Day, To tell what Numbers numberless, what Knights, And glitt'ring Dames adorn'd the Festal Rites, What Joys the Banquet or the Bowl could yield, Or what the Trophies of the tilting Field. Loud were the Revels, boundless was the mirth, That hail'd the sweetest brightest Pair on Earth, Of Men, the wisest, bravest, fairest, He; Of all that's beautiful most beauteous, She, Love, Nature, Harmony the Union claim'd, And each for each, and both for one were fram'd. But we of subsequent Adventure treat, And hasten to unfold their future Fate. Some Months young Alla and his peerless Bride, In cordial Bond of dear Accordance tied, Had look'd and smil'd the precious Hours away, And fed on Bliss that ne'er could know Decay; He whose turn'd Ear on that enchanting Tongue With Thirst of fondest Inclination hung, Won by a Preacher with so fair a Face, Becomes the zealous Proselyte of Grace, And Subjects too their heath'nish Rites forego, For still from Courts, or Vice, or Virtues, flow. But ah! too soon, from Beauty's softer Charms, War, rig'rous War, and Scotia call to Arms, Constantia must her blooming Hero yield, And Honour sent him to th' embattell'd Field. Mean while, the pregnant Fruit of chaste Delight With a Male Infant crown'd the nuptial Rite; All sweet and lovely as the smiling Morn, Mauritius was to bless a Nation born; Their Pledge of future Bliss, their princely Boy, The Britons hail with universal Joy, Their Fancy frames him what their Pray'rs require, Sweet as their Queen, and valiant as his Sire, Offa to whom the King's departing Care, (Inestimable Charge) confign'd the Fair, Advice of loyal Gratulation sent, To glad his Sov'reign with the blest Event. But Donnegilda, cruel, crafty Dame, Great Alla's Mother over-fond of Fame, She, (as all antique Parents, wond'rous Sage! For Youth project the Inappetence of Age, Each Sense endearing, and humane, despise, And on the Mammon feast their down-cast Eyes) Malevolent beheld a Stranger led, Unknown, unfriended to the regal Bed; For in the secret Closet of her Breast, Constantia her imperial Birth suppress'd, Till Heav'n shou'd perfect the connubial Band, And with her Royal Off-spring bless the Land. Ah! ill tim'd Caution! were this Truth declar'd, What a vast Cost of future Woe was spar'd, But where Heav'ns Will th' unequal Cause supplies, To set the World on Fire, a Spark may well suffice. The subtile Dame who now the Occasion spy'd, To tear Constantia from her Alla's Side, Debauch'd the Messenger, his Mandate stole, And forg'd in Offa's Name the crafty Scroll, Wherein she fram'd a Tale with wond'rous Art, How the feign'd Fair by Witchcraft won his Heart, Seduced his Senses with infernal Lore, And a dread Monster (hideous Off-spring) bore. But Alla, of whose fond, whose faithful Breast, His Consort was the dear eternal Guest, Unmov'd, return'd his Bliss was too refin'd, Without the just Allay that Heav'n assign'd, And what Constantia bore, or Heav'n decreed, To be unwelcome, must be strange indeed. This Letter too the Courier, as before, To Britain's Dowager unweeting bore, And in the Surfeit of oblivious Wine Left her to perpetrate the black Design. This too she cancell'd, forg'd the regal Hand, And pityless inscribed the dire Command, With Threats that Offa to the wonted Sea, Shou'd the false Queen and hated Imp convey, And there permit the now detested Dame To seek the Shore from whence the Sorceress came. When Offa had the barb'rous Mandate read, To Heav'n his Eyes and lifted Hands he spred, Like Niobe to Marble turn'd he stood, Grief, Fear and Horror froze the gen'rous Blood, Again he stir'd, as from some wistful Dream, Again he read, alas! he read the same. But (tho' in Terms of soothing Phrase express'd) When now Constantia learn'd her Lord's Behest, Keen Anguish, piercing to the Springs of Life, At once arrests the Mother and the Wife, For not, to her alone confin'd, as late When bold she stood the weightiest Stroke of Fate, A thousand Cares of soft endearing Kind, Now share with Heaven the Motions of her Mind, And with fond Thoughts of sweet Concern divide, The melting Mother, and the clasping Bride, And these alone her bursting Bosom rend, And o'er the Couch her lifeless Limbs extend. Fame pour'd the mourning Populace around, In gushing Anguish ev'ry Eye is drown'd, Compassion set her Virtues full to View, And with their Queen bid ev'ry Joy adieu, Swift from his Throne they wish their Alla hurl'd, And her, crown'd Empress of the peopled World. But ah! in vain their Pray'rs and Tears delay, Strict was the Charge, and Offa must obey, With heavy Heart and faint reluctant Hand, He led the Mourner to the neighb'ring Strand, She to the heaving Whiteness of her Breast, With melting Looks her helpless Infant prest; And thus, while Sobs her piteous Accent broke, Her little inattentive Child bespoke. “Weep not sweet Wretch! tho' such thy Father's Will, “Yet hast thou one, one hapless Parent still, “Peace, Peace, to thee thy Mother means no Harm, “Nor let our Lot thy little Heart alarm, “O'er Thee till Death, o'er Thee, my Cares shall wake, “And love thee for thy cruel Father's sake.” Had ev'ry Sire (as on the Banks of Nile,) Lost his first-born throughout Britannia's Isle, Or Death with undistinguish'd Carnage swept Wives, Sons, and Sires, by all the Living wept; Such haply were the Woes that now deplore Their Queen attended to the ecchoing Shore, They tear their Locks, their rueful Bosoms smite, And trace her Bark with long pursuing Sight. Tedious it were, tho' wond'rous strange to tell, What new Adventures o'er the Main befel, How fondly pratling, while her Infant smiled, She the long Hours, and wint'ry Nights beguiled, Till seiz'd by Pirates on th' Atlantick Wave, A Prince of Gallia bought th' imperial Slave. How in calm Peace, and Friendship long retain'd, High Trust and Grace her winning Sweetness gain'd, Till she to Rome (predestinate Event) Associate with her Lord and Mistress went. But now to Britain let the Muse repair, For there the valiant Alla claims her Care. Triumphant soon from Scotia he return'd, And to behold his lov'd Constantia burn'd: This wings his Feet along the toilsome Way; But Thoughts are swifter, swifter far than They; Hope, elevate, the distant Journey metes, And to his March his Heart the Measure beats. But when o'er Tweed he led his conqu'ring Host, And trode the Verdure of Northumbria's Coast, While Laurels round their trophied Temples twin'd, And Banners wanton'd in the curling Wind, No wonted Crouds their once-lov'd Alla meet, No prostrate Knees, or hailing Voices greet; Blank was his Passage o'er the pensive Ground, And Silence cast a mournful Gloom around; Or if his Prince, some straggling Peasant spy'd, As from a Basilisk he slunk aside. What this might mean revolv'd within his Breast, Conjecture dire, and whisp'ring Doubts suggest, More dread than Death, some hideous Ill impart, (This the first Fear e'er seiz'd on Alla's Heart) But worse, O worse than Fancy yet could fear, When now the killing Truth arrests his Ear, Athwart his Eyes and mantling round his Soul, Thick Clouds of Grief and inky Darkness roll, His Sense, nor Tears, nor utt'ring Groans could tell, But froze and lock'd in speechless Woe he fell. At length by Care, by cruel Kindness, brought, To all the Anguish of returning Thought, Swift from the Sheath he drew the deadly Guest, And would have pierc'd this Vulture in his Breast, Such was the Sting of agonizing Pain, His Frenzy wou'd th' immortal Soul have slain. But this prevented, round th' attending Crew; With baleful Glance, his eager Eyes he threw, Constantia he requires with frantic Tongue, Constantia still the restless Accents sung; To Her, as present, now his Fondness speaks, As absent, into desp'rate Action breaks; “Oh never, never more, my Queen! he cries, “Shall that known Form attract these dying Eyes; “Never!—O, 'tis the worst, the last Despair; “Never is long, is wondrous long to bear. “Down, down, ye Cloud-topt Hills, your Summits stoop, “With me, in Sign of endless Mourning droop: “Snapt be the Spear, bright Armour groun'd to Dust, “Repose thou Corslet in eternal Rust; “Still'd be each Tube, the Trumpet's warlike Swell, “Empire, and Fame, all, all, with Thee farewell: “For Thee alone, thy conqu'ring Soldier arm'd, “The Banner wav'd, and sprightly Clangor charm'd “But Arms and loath'd Desire with Thee are dead, “And Joy, No, never to return, is fled. Thus rav'd the Youth, to wilful Woes resign'd, And, offer'd Aid was Sickness to his Mind. To Frenzy by uxorious Transports rais'd, His Vengeance on his aged Parent seiz'd; Who doom'd to lose that too designing Head, A Victim to his lov'd Constantia, bled. But Violence in Nature cannot last, What Region's known to bear eternal Blast? Time changes all, dissolves the melting Rock, And on fix'd Water turns the christal Lock. Time o'er his Anguish shed a silent Balm, A Peace unsmiling, and a gloomy Calm; By Ill untaught to mourn, by Joy to glow, And still insensible to Bliss or Woe. To Him, thus careless of the circling Year, Five annual Suns had roll'd their bright Career; To Heav'n alone, his earthly Ardors turn'd, There, late to meet the dear Constantia, burn'd. Still that fond Hope remain'd,—his sole Desire, And gave new Wings to the celestial Fire, But yet—Hereafter—What might there betide The Blood-stain'd Hand, by whom a Parent died: This, this gave doubtful Thought, unhing'd his Rest, And shook the Region of his contrite Breast: At length taught satiate Vengeance to relent, And ship'd for Rome, the Royal Pilgrim sent. O'er Tiber soon the far-fraught Tidings sped, (For far beyond the Warrior's Fame had spread) And Gallia's Hugo, to whose gen'rous Care Protecting Heav'n consign'd the wandring Fair, With Those, whom virtuous Approbation fir'd As still the Brave are by the Brave admir'd; To see, to touch, the gallant Alla glow'd, And rank'd to meet the Regal Pilgrim rode. With all due Rite and answ'ring Grace humane, The courteous Prince receiv'd the shining Train, But Hugo chief, with Port of winning View, The Hero's Eye, and prime Affection drew; And him (with Note selected from the rest) The Prince sollicits for a frequent Guest. But ah! when now it reach'd Constantia's Ear, That Alla, lovely, barb'rous Man, was near, Her Soul, a thousand diff'rent Thoughts assail, Expell'd by Turns, by Turns they all prevail; With melting Joy, and burning Love she glows, With cooling Grief, and icy Hate she froze, Dear to her Heart, though horrid to her Will, He was the lov'd, the charming Alla still. Nor Hugo now (in pompous Dress array'd) To wait Britannia's potent Lord delay'd,; With Him Mauritius frequent Chat supply'd, A little gay Companion at his Side, He beams a Ganymede, in whose sweet Face The Sire and Mother liv'd with mingling Grace; Here still they met, in Beauty reconcil'd; Here still in soft delicious Union, smil'd; So join'd, so blended, with divinest Art, As left it not in any Pow'r to part. Upon the Pratler's Aspect, with Surprize, And charm'd Attention, Alla fix'd his Eyes, Somewhat of wonted Semblance there he spy'd, Dear to his Sense, and to his Heart ally'd; Somewhat that touch'd beyond all mortal View, And inly with the Link of Nature, drew; Disturb'd he rose, upon his secret Soul, Unweeting Thaw, and cordial Earnings stole; Big with the soft Distress, aside he stept, And much the Warrior wonder'd why he wept. Compos'd, he clasp'd the Infant to his Breast, And ask'd, what Sire with such a Son was blest? “That (Hugo cry'd) his Dame alone must show; “Sire hath he none, or none of Whom we know; “But Mother, sure, he hath, that's such a Mate “No Man can boast, nor boastful Tongue relate; “Though Fancy, to give Semblance of her Face, “From all her Sex should call each sep'rate Grace; “To speak her Soul should rob from ev'ry Saint, “Low yet were Phrase, and all Description faint. Thus, while his Tongue with free Encomium flow'd, With strange Emotion Alla's Aspect glow'd; Full on his Heart the dear Idea rush'd, His Cheek with Hope, and lively Ardor flush'd; When strait Despondence sick'ning in his Soul, From its known Seat the rosy Tincture stole: “Once once he cry'd (the lab'ring Sigh suppress'd) “Such Treasure once these widow'd Arms possess'd, “Nature is rich,—yet gladly should I know, “If the World's Round can such Another shew. “Be that (reply'd the Gallic-Chief) confess'd, “Whene'er my House boasts Alla for a Guest. They went—but when the long-dissever'd Pair, Her Alla here, and his Constantia there— By Doubts, Loves, Fears, and rushing Joys dismay'd, Unmov'd, each Face, with mutual Gaze survey'd, Such was the Scene, th' impassion'd Gesture such, As Phrase can't reach, nor liveliest Pencil touch. Three times the Fair One sought the Shades of Death, Three times reviv'd by Alla's balmy Breath; And thrice his guiltless Plea he would essay, And thrice she turn'd, Constantia turn'd away. “Now, by this Hand (Britannia's Hero cry'd) “This Hand, by whom a cruel Parent dy'd, “Long since for Thee, for Thee thou dear One, bled, “A Victim sacred to that injur'd Head, “Of all thy Wrongs thy Alla is as clear, “As here my Son, thy other Alla here, “Ah! could you know the Anguish, the Distress, “(But who can know what Words can ne'er express?) “What Racks, what Deaths, thy tort'ring Absence cost, “What restless Toil this suff'ring Bosom toss'd, “'Twas such a Ruin, such a Breach of Care, “As this and only this could e'er repair. So saying, swift resistless to his Breast, The yielding Fair repeated Transport press'd; But when all Doubt and cold Suspicion clear'd, Her Lord still faithful as belov'd appear'd, By her so oft, so cruelly accus'd, Still kind and true, and as her self abus'd, She in his Bosom all with Joy o'erpowr'd, Of Sobs and Tears the copious Tempest showr'd, All Eyes around the melting Measure kept, And Pleasure through contagious Transport wept. For Heav'n alone can emulate the Sweet Of one Hour's Bliss when two such Lovers meet. Still had Constantia, lock'd within her Breast, The Royal Secret of her Birth suppress'd. When Rome's imperial Monarch wide invites To social Cheer and festival Delights: For now triumphant from the Syrian Coast, Tho' long detain'd, return'd his vengeful Host; And to reward their Toils and drown their Cares The Monarch on a solemn Day prepares. With festal Robes adorn'd each Warrior came; In glitt'ring Vesture many a Roman Dame; And there amid the Peers, a peerless Guest, There Alla came in regal Splendors drest; All India beaming at the Hero's Side, O'er beaming India shone his brighter Bride, While the young Joy of each applauding Tongue, Mauritius, on his smiling Parents hung, As tho' a stripling Cherub should attend, Where two of prime angelick Rank descend. Struck at the pleasing Prospect all admire, But mute with Wonder stood th' imperial Sire; For haply since our primal Parents fell Ne'er met a Pair that could this Pair excel. He at his left Britannia's Monarch plac'd, And his right Hand th' unknown Constantia grac'd: When with a starting Tear the rev'rend Man, (To Alla turn'd) in placid Speech began; “Young, tho' thou art, with earliest Vigour strung, “And the fond Theme of Fame's applauding Tongue, “'Tis said thou hast the Stings of Fortune felt, “And such can learn from others Woes to melt: “I had a Daughter, once my only Care, “As virtuous as thy Consort and as fair, “But her (sad Cause of Folly to repent) “To Syria with a numerous Train I sent, “And there the Toil the treach'rous Toil was spred, “And there Constantia, there my Child you bled! “Around the Maid her brave Attendants fell, “Nor one was left the fatal Tale to tell; “Hence Age through Grief has doubly known Decay, “And Care untimely turn'd my Locks to grey, “This Day selected from the circling Year, “To her I consecrate the annual Tear, “And these the Chiefs, who in her Quarrel crown'd, “Have late in Vengeance bath'd the hostile Ground. “But vain is Vengeance where all Hope is fled, “Nor Hosts of Victims can revive the Dead, “My Child! thou'st rob'd my Life of all Delight, “But Death shall soon our happier Souls unite.” Nor yet he ended,—when with troubled Mein, Quick at his Knees low bow'd Britannia's Queen “Not so, not so, my Father, (loud she cry'd) “See here thy Child, thy Daughter at thy Side; “Why look you thus with wild and piercing Eye? “Your Daughter here, your Daughter you descry! “Constantia, who through many a Death survives “And yet to see her King and Sire, arrives.” “Yes, yes, you are my Child,—these Accents tell,— He cou'd no more, but on her Neck he fell, Down her soft Cheek his mingling Tears o'erflow, Joy, Joy too great, assum'd the Form of Woe; The Roof, Surprize and ecchoing Transport tore, And Eyes then wept, that never wept before. Wing'd as an Arrow from some vig'rous Arm, Through Rome's wide City flew the glad Alarm, Constantia's here,—she lives,-she lives,—they cry'd, Constantia now the British Hero's Bride; Around the Palace pour'd in wild Delight, On Thousands gath'ring Thousands strait unite; With ceaseless Clamours and extended Hands, Constantia's Presence ev'ry Voice demands, Constantia, Alla, and their lovely Boy, They claim, the blooming Pledge of future Joy. Forth strait they come, conspicuous to the View, And greet with graceful Mien, th' applauding Crew, In Shouts to Heav'n their Exultations fly, And universal Joy torments the Sky. End of Constantia, or the MAN of LAW's TALE. PROLOGUE TO The Squire's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. Around, on All, at the Narration gaz'd Our Host, now highly on his Stirrup rais'd. “So may my Soul o'er the dire Fiend prevail, “As this, (he cry'd) was a judicious Tale! “Body of Jesus, rouze, Sir Parish Priest, “Our Ears with some delicious Story feast. “By Heav'ns! I held, before this lucky Day, “That Men of Learning had the least to say. “But since the Tales here told, as was agreed, “In Faith, I worship all that write or read. “Then up, Sir Parish Priest, at Sound of Bell, “Fulfil your Promise in the Name of Hell! The Parson answer'd. ‘Bless me, Son, forbear! ‘What ails the Man so sinfully to swear? “Ho! Jenkins, are you there? (our Host rejoin'd) “My Friends, I smell a Loller in the Wind. “Lo, one of Wickliffe's Tribe, his Sermon hear! “And purify your Heart, and cleanse your Ear! “Mild is his Aspect, but his Sentence sour, “He'll pray it, and he'll preach it for an Hour. ‘That shall he not, (reply'd the sprightly Squire) ‘Tho' to expound the Text, without the Hire, ‘Not for this Hour, at least, or pray or preach, ‘New gloss the Gospel, or new Doctrine teach, ‘Let Priests say what they please, repose in Heav'n, ‘Trust All in Him, by whom our All was giv'n. ‘God gave us Being, and we live in God; ‘Our Master he; revere his single Rod: ‘For many a Scruple springs from many a Clerk, ‘Who starts the Doubt, then leaves you in the dark. ‘Attend his heavy Toil, to Night from Morn, ‘'Tis sowing Tares amidst your cleanly Corn: ‘And therefore, Host, my genuine Story take; ‘Nor may it lull Attention, but awake. ‘From Physick here, no sage Remark I draw, ‘Nor puzzle you with one quaint Term of Law, ‘Nor from Philosophy, high Matter seek, ‘Nor lard my Tale with Latin or with Greek. ‘Better be wisely gay, than dully read; ‘Small Store of learned Lumber fills my Head. End of the Prologue. CAMBUSCAN: OR, The Squire's TALE. By Mr. BOYSE. I. Where peopled Scythia's verdant Plain extend, East in that Sea, in whose unfathom'd Flood, Long-winding Volga's rapid Streams descend, On Oxus' Bank an ancient City stood; Then Sarra, but to later Ages known, By rising Samarcand's imperial Name; There, held a potent Prince his honour'd Throne, And distant Nations own'd Cambuscan's Fame: So was the Sultan call'd, whose lengthen'd Sway, Surrounding Realms revere, and pleas'd his own obey. II. When nervous Youth had brac'd his valiant Breast, Oft had the Russian felt his dreadful Arm; The Persian oft his martial Pow'r carress'd, And the wild Cossack shrunk at his Alarm; Strict to the Law th' Arabian Prophet taught, Compassionately just, and greatly kind, His Virtue scarce was shaded with a Fault, True was his League and constant as his Mind: Great Wealth he had, but well that Wealth enjoy'd, And Pow'r, Heaven's noblest Gift, as nobly he employ'd. III. To raise the Honours of his spotless State, (A Joy too seldom known in regal Life!) Fortune had bless'd him with an equal Mate, And given the fair Eltheta to his Wife; The graceful Queen, majestick to the View, Whose blooming Youth had bless'd the Hero's Arms; Her high Descent from great Arsaces drew, And native Dignity adorn'd her Charms; Two manly Sons their faithful Union bound, And one unblemish'd Maid with ev'ry Virtue crown'd. IV. Algarsife first who grac'd his youthful Bed, Breath'd all the Victor's irresistless Flame; In Camps beneath his Father's Conduct bred, His Warrior Bosom swell'd for endless Fame; Well practis'd he the daring Troops to head, Bold to attack or strike the steady Blow, Or skill'd with Art the patient March to lead O'er the long Desart—and surprize the Foe! With missive Death to guard the wheeling Rear, As darts the Bolt of Jove,—and shines to disappear. V. But young Camballo's more reflective Mind From his great Sire's immediate Temper drew A softer Turn, and studiously inclin'd To judge of Fame in a superior View; To mend the Genius of the barren Soil, With prudent Laws the social Ties to bind, To cherish Commerce, and encourage Toil, With Health the Youth to form, with Truth the Mind, Arts, whence the publick Welfare takes its Rise, And Empire lifts her Head, exalted to the Skies! VI. Beneath some rooted Oak's projected Shade, Where twine the Lawrel and the Olive bloom; In mildest Grace amidst the shelter'd Bed, The nascent Rose displays its soft Perfume: Such Canace with all becoming State, While Love inthron'd from her enchanting Brow, Dispers'd a thousand Arrows wing'd with Fate, And smil'd to rule th' admiring World below! Her Form was Harmony,—all Grace her Air, As if Perfection, pleas'd, had plac'd its Centre there! VII. No Affectation sully'd Beauty's Pride; No Vanity bespoke a wanton Fire; In all her Action Virtue seem'd to guide, Nor knew her chaster Breast a loose Desire: As thro' the lucid Diamonds polish'd Face, Refulgent pierce the treasur'd Rays of Light; No Spot the native Lustre can deface, Which view'd in every Shape is always bright: So thro' fair Beauty's Mirror undefil'd, With still-attractive Charms internal Wisdom smil'd. VIII. Now twice ten Years had good Cambuscan reign'd, By early Wars secur'd in honour'd Ease, And Peace at home, and Fame abroad maintain'd, Mark'd the meridian Glory of his Days. In those blest Times, no labour'd Structures rose, Where Grandeur from the publick Ruin springs, The splendid Trophies of a People's Woes! The dearly purchas'd Palaces of Kings! Far other State his Dignity supports, Beyond the borrow'd Blaze of Europe's gilded Courts. IX. Yet Goodness still a nobler Show supply'd, Then glittering Guards to awe the subject Eye, The hospitable Gates were ever wide, And safe the Wretched to their Prince drew nigh. As the warm Sun diffuses golden Day, So smil'd the common Father of the Land. As spreads o'er Earth the all-enlivening Ray, So felt the Meanest his extensive Hand. Happy, where thus the Sovereign's Bounty warms, And Goodness lends to Pow'r, a Plenitude of Charms. X. From Aries now approach'd the Solar Flame, While wakeful Spring the wint'ry Chain unbinds. Nature re-kindles to the amorous Beam, And swells luxuriant in the Western Winds; At Flora's Call a thousand Beauties rise, To dress with Sweets the fair enamell'd Ground, And to the happy Sense and ravish'd Eyes, Waft new Delight and fragrant Pleasure round. Each Bird proclaims his Joy, and thro' the Grove Resounds the heavenly Song of Harmony and Love! XI. The Season this, when (so their Prophet taught) The joyful City kept the holy Feast, Which the wild Saracen with secret Thought, Reveres, the Bairam of the turban'd East: On whose preceding Eve, with wonted State, Thro' ev'ry Street the royal Herald's Sound Proclaims Cambuscan's Feast to Crouds who wait, With fond acclaiming Joy their Passage round: Peace smiles on ev'ry Brow,—and Sarra glad, Prepares to keep the Day, in all her Pomp array'd. XII. Now rose Aurora, robed in pleasing grey, Her sober Mantle edg'd with beamy Gold! The early Clarion hails the dawning Ray, The Gates their Iron Portals wide unfold; High on a Rock, encircled by the Flood, Where silver Mazes oft deceiv'd the Eyes, The Palace rose:—below the City stood, In Circuit fair, and glitter'd to the Skies! A gentle Rising fill'd the Space between, With Sylvan Pride adorn'd, and Banks of native Green, XIII. Here, so the Sultan's honour'd Mandate bore, Soon as the Sun disclos'd his orient Pride; Thro' the glad Multitude, that throng'd before, The Tartar Lords conven'd on ev'ry Side: Along the fair Ascent, in shining Train, Towards the Palace march the noble Band; Pleas'd to renew their annual Vows again, To see their King, and hail his just Command; And wish to the past Years by Fate decreed, In fair continued Course—the future may succeed. XIV. But wise Cambuscan, who observant knew, The Pow'r supreme from whom all Greatness flows, On this peculiar Day with Homage due To Heaven returns the Service Grandeur owes. No vain Idolatry his Heart deceiv'd, No flattering Names of Mighty, High or Great; Grateful he offers ev'ry Praise received From a glad People and a happy State: And chiefly on this Morn his Heart prepares To pay his humble Thanks in Sacrifice and Pray'rs. XV. The Pomp begins, the yielding Croud give Way; A thousand Horse the bright Procession lead; A chosen Troop, with Bows and Quivers gay, And bold Algasife glitters at their Head! Toil mark'd each Limb, and on their hardy Brow, Sate dreadless Valour, mix'd with Awe severe; Yet each seem'd pleas'd to grace the Triumph now, And Peace had soften'd half the Victor's Air: While as they pass, redoubled Shouts arise, And Oxus' hilly Banks the Eccho long supplies! XVI. The Pontiffs next, Administers of Law, The hoary Molla, and the Cadi sage, Whose venerable Looks impress'd an Awe; For Wisdom gives new Dignity to Age. Not the sour Aspect, nor the formal Beard, Nor Saint-like Visage, nor dejected Air; But Virtue dress'd in Cheerfulness appear'd, And Health and Temperance were pictur'd there. The joy'd Spectators much their Sight approve, Whose Goodness careful gain'd the People's honest Love. XVII. All in the midst, with precious Care inroll'd In tissued Bands bedrop'd with many a Gem; A Camel proud, bedeck'd with Silk and Gold, The Koran bore, which Mussulmen esteem! Around the Emirs, whose illustrious Race From the great Prophet claims its high Descent, All robed in Green advanced, with gentle Pace Bestowing numerous Blessings as they went: A Silence deep ensues,—and ev'ry Look, With conscious Awe salutes the heaven descended Book. XVIII. Then came the Merchants, an un-number'd Band, With more familiar Mein, the Sons of Peace! For Commerce now establish'd thro' the Land, Had shed its Sweets, and dwelt in ev'ry Face; Plain was their Garb, and free from gaudy Pride; For yet no baneful Luxury was known; But Wealth domestick well that Show supplied, And frugal Manners kept their Wealth their own, Fond of the Arts he rais'd, with gentle Air, Camballo graceful rode a Polish Courser fair. XIX. Amidst the Guar dianSages of the Throne, Where prudent Counsels prop'd his settled State, Distinguish'd far, the much-lov'd Monarch shone, Less in Magnificence than Virtue great; Not the rich Crimson which his Person drest, Nor Indian Diamond his Tiara crown'd; Not the Siberian Fur nor Persian Vest, Nor Syrian Sabre which his Vesture bound; Such wide Respect produc'd, or fond Acclaim, As join'd in friendly Bands the King's and Father's Name. XX. Here the enfeebled Sight its Force excell'd, Eager its great Protector to survey; As fond the Eye of Infancy beheld, Striving to bear some Feature fond away; That Age the grateful Image might renew, That Youth might strong imprint Cambuscan's Name, While to the worthy Monarch's smiling View, His People's Bliss in present Prospect came! A Pleasure this which Virtue only finds, The Wreath which Truth confers, and Fame eternal binds! XXI. The Rites perform'd,—and every Prayer addrest, Which Faith exacts, or Piety can pay; The Day's fair Interval the People past, In manly Exercise, and floral Play: Algarsife pleas'd the active Youth regards, Excites the Modest, and commends the Brave; Assigns proportioned Merit its Rewards, And teaches all with Vigour to behave: In mimic Squadrons forms the flying Horse, And animates the Rage, and Order of the Course. XXII. Mean while Cambuscan, with the elder Chiefs, And young Camballo held the cool Debate; With Care consult to ease the Peoples Griefs, The Means to strengthen and improve the State. From neighb'ring Tribes commission'd Envoys press, To court his Friendship, or his League renew; From subject Provinces with glad Address, New Deputies salute their Monarch's View; Who all with condescending Grace receives, And tenderly to each his just Instructions gives. XXIII. Now from the Zenith flam'd the Orb of Day, When to the Royal Square, selected Place, The warlike Trumpet warns the Guests away, Where the King's Banquet spreads its gladsome Face, Decent around the pleas'd Attendants smile, Appointed to fulfil their Lord's Commands: The meanest they salute with courteous Stile, And not a Stranger unregarded stands. Well from their Prince they learn the gentle Art With fair Humanity to charm the honest Heart. XXIV. Near hand, allotted to the princely Train, A spacious Hall receiv'd each nobler Guest; Where to the dazzled Eye a brighter Scene Display'd the Treasures of the downy East; The Walls dispread with Persia's Tap'stry, shine; The azure Roof emboss'd with figur'd Gold; Of Casbin's richest Loom the Carpets twine, Where many a flow'ry Maze appear'd enroll'd; And Golden Censers, plac'd in proper Room, With all Arabia's Sweets embalm'd the fragrant Dome. XXV. Silent, around the Slaves attendant wait, Silent, the watchful Grooms dispose the Feast; Silence and Order mark the Asian State, The Sign imperial, and submissive Breast: With China's largest Bowls they spread the Board, From ev'ry Element the Spoils they take The richest Dainties Sarra can afford, Fish from the Stream, and Fowls that haunt the Lake. The Fawn and Stag the specious Forests yield, And Herbs and various Fruits the cultivated Field. XXVI. Their Drinks, Sherbets attemper'd to the Taste, A thousand diff'rent Ways with Eastern Art; Where mingling Spices give a racy Zest, And warm, like cordial Wine, the gladden'd Heart. Mean time, the Commons, with inferior Fare, Harsh, seeming to our nicer Eye, regale; The Forest-Fruits, the curdled Milk of Mare, Or Grain, the Product of the fertile Vale: With purest Water from the chrystal Stream, That feeds with cool Supplies Life's quick consuming Flame! XXVII. Concludes the Feast, with ev'ry Service paid, When from the publick Square's capacious Bound, Appear full fifty Youths in White array'd, Of comely Form, with rich Tiaras crown'd; Each at his Side, with Care attendant leads A shapely Courser of Tartarian Breed; Who neighing, seems to spurn the Ground he treads, As conscious of his Servitude decreed: Marks of that Duty Sarra loyal owes, For all the peaceful Sweets Cambuscan's Reign bestows! XXVIII. An hundred Virgins, each of fairest Hue, In flowing Robes of brightest Azure drest, Succeed in soft Procession, two by two: Their beauteous Brows with flow'ry Chaplets grac'd, Their lovely Hands a shining Treasure bore, Which new-establish'd Commerce brought from far; The Indian Gem, the Pearl from Ormus Shore, The Tyrian Purple, and the painted Jar; Or the domestick Spoils of Sarra's Field, The costly-ermin'd Furs her ample Forests yield. XXIX. These Presents offer'd with respectful Care, Rewarded by the gracious Monarch's Smile, Amidst the Dome, a second Train appear Of foreign Beauties from Circassia's Soil: From native Sweets the Infant-Captives brought With melting Charms barbaric Hearts to move, Early in ev'ry Art of Pleasing taught To sing, to smile, to languish, and to love! Magnificently gay, the Band advance, And with harmonious Air begin the wanton Dance! XXX. At this—a Sight too loose for Wisdom's Awe, Whose Strictness views such Mirth with Eye severe; Prepare the King and Sages to withdraw, That Youth its more appropriate Joys may share; When unforeseen, as wak'ning Tempests rise, When troubl'd Ocean heaves with conscious Fear; Such, and so strange the gath'ring Murmur flies, Increasing, till it gains the Royal Ear: Sudden the Music stops,—the Dancers cease, And new-born Wonder sits confess'd in ev'ry Face! XXXI. Soon shines the Cause—for now the Crowd divides, When nobly mounted, of distinguish'd Mien, Entring, a graceful Stranger boldly rides; His Helm unbrac'd, and in his Visage seen Valour, by long Experience made sedate:— His Courser form'd of Brass, whose burnish'd Light Reflected beamy Rays of mimic Heat; A moving Meteor to the dazzled Sight! Proud of his Charge, he fiercely glanc'd Disdain, And bent his shapely Neck beneath the potent Rein! XXXII. The Knight's Right Hand the flaming Steed compell'd, With gentle Awe, and half his Rage repress'd; His Left to View a polish'd Mirror held, Of oval Form, in figur'd Gold enchas'd: His Finger glitter'd with the radiant Pride, An oriental Saphyr wide display'd: A naked Scymitar adorn'd his Side; With Torquoise-Hilt, of damask'd Steel the Blade: His comely Personage, and strange Attire, Cambuscan studious Eyes, and much the Court admire. XXXIII. Then mild advancing, where th' Imperial Throne Erected, to the distant Sight ascends; Quick from his wondrous Steed alighting down, Before the King the gentle Envoy bends! Then to the throng'd Assembly turns his Eyes, With due Obedience paid to all around; While general Silence marks a pleas'd Surprize, And not a Whisper steals along the Ground: Each Aspect earnest on the Issue hung, When thus the Knight began, with no ungraceful Tongue! XXXIV. “To Thee, for Virtue as for Arms renown'd, “Whose Name to distant Lands extends its Rays; “Whose Youth with Fame, whose Age with Honours crown'd, “Asia repeats!—too narrow for thy Praise! “Our holy Califf, whose all-righteous Sway, “Thro' happy Nations spreads one common Smile; “Northward from Ormus to the Euxine Sea, “And West from Indus to the Banks of Nile; “To thee, Al-raschid, round whose renown'd Head “May Heav'n its balmy Dew of constant Blessings shed! XXXV. “To Thee, whose Piety, his Zeal befriends, “Whose Arms have triumph'd in the Prophet's Cause; “These Marks of Amity our Califf sends, “Proofs of his Estimation and Applause! “Nor slight the Presents, tho' no Form they wear, “That seems attractive to a Monarch's Eye; “More secret Worth they boast, and Virtues rare, “Than all the Treasures hid beneath the Sky, “Which Heav'n-taught Science only can bestow, “And mystic Talismans, that rule the World below. XXXVI. “This Steed, which, mighty Prince, you now behold “As motionless,—tho' recent from the Reins, “Form'd, tho' in semblance of metallic Mold, “Yet in himself the Springs of Life retains; “Less fleet the feather'd Arrow wings its Way, “Borne on the Pinions of the breezy Wind, “Less swift the canvass'd Vessel skims the Sea, “Then leave his Steps the less'ning Space behind, “Brave the surrounding Deep, where Oceans flow, “Or mount the steep broad Rock, and lose the Plain below! XXXVII. “Or, would'st thou from the Sphere terrestrial rise, “And learn the boundless Regions of the Air? “Th' aerial Guide shall waft thee thro' the Skies “To the remotest Star that glitters there! “Firm shall he bear thy trusted Weight impress'd “Thro' Floods that threaten, or thro' Fires that glow! “Or guard thee with impenetrable Breast, “Thro' pointed Javelins o'er the prostrate Foe: “For the sage Author form'd his just Design “With Planetary Skill, and Artifice Divine! XXXVIII. “Yet rooted shall the beauteous Image stand, “A lifeless Monument shall press the Place; “Void of all Sense, and deaf to all Command, “Nor human Force disturb it from its Base; “Unless thy Thought the mystic Words retain, “That wake to Motion the insensate Mass; “That give Direction to the rapid Rein, “Or stop the Springs of animated Brass”. He paus'd:—diffusive as the Murmur ran, When thus resuming soon—th' Embassador began. XXXIX. “This Mirror—so our Empress fair commands, “As Pledge of mutual Faith and Friendship meant; “To thy Imperial Consort's beauteous Hands, “With grateful Joy, commission'd, I present! “No specious Forms from hence reflected glare, “No shadowy Objects of material kind; “But mental Truths within disclos'd appear, “Fate's future Births Enquiry here shall find; “And in the optic Plane thy Thought shall trace “The various Fortunes wait thy long descending Race. XL. “Does War or Faction threat thy promis'd Reign? “Here shalt thou see the Perils, and avert; “Does Plague or Famine hover near thy Plain? “A timely Caution shall arise from Art: “If Falshood lurks in Flatt'ry's fair Disguise? “Here Truth's fair Face shall point the Syren's Face! “If Vice, by Virtue's Ruin, aims to rise? “Here shall it meet thy Knowledge and Disgrace: “And thy observant Thought with Ease shall find “The variegated Shapes that veil the human Mind. XLI. “Here pleas'd, thy gentle Sultaness shall prove, “A thousand Ways the sportive Mirror's Skill; “Survey the Crafts of Jealousy and Love, “The Stratagems that wait a Female Will: “Thro' ev'ry Maze the shifting Heart pursue, “From Fancy's Start, to Reason's close Retreat; “Observe Imagination's subtile Clue, “And mark Ideas, how they rise and set. “Gain'd but the Key—which to the Queen I bear, “Long may her Virtues prove the Guardian Mirror's Care! XLII. So said,—the Present with complacent Air To an Attendant near, the Envoy gave; When thus proceeding—“Further speaks my Care, “If Thou, all gracious Monarch, grant the Leave! “For thus our Sov'reign Lady bade me say; “Pleas'd, has she heard a Northern Princess Fame: “One Faith we keep, one Prophet we obey; “Let closer Bands unite our Sister's Name! “The Rose of Tigris, Sarra's Violet woos, “And with this mystic Ring her valu'd Friendship sues! XLIII. “When from the Earth the King of Wisdom fled, “Whose Science pierc'd thro' Matter's boundless Field; “When mourn'd the East that Salomon was dead, “To whom the Realms of Spirit stood reveal'd; “The potent Seal incircling, grac'd his Hand, “Whence all its Pow'r this Gem's Impression takes, “Obedient Nature feels its wide Command, “And at its Call a new Creation breaks. “Each vegetable Birth its Power reveals, “The noxious Weed that kills, or Plant that wholesome heals! XLIV. “Or, would the Princess, while with cheerful Eyes “She views the Beauties of the op'ning Spring, “Curious enquire the Language of the Skies, “Or learn the Notes the feather'd Nations sing? “Hence shall the vocal Natives of the Groves, “With well-known Hymns salute her early Walk; “Hence shall their Laws, their Manners, and their Loves “Become familiar Subjects of her Talk: “And while the Sylvan World her Thoughts command, “Her grateful Mind shall own a Princess' gen'rous Hand. XLV. He said, and bow'd, and Speech resum'd once more, While from his Side he drew the shining Blade, “And last this Gift the Califf's Order bore, “Be to your princely Sons with Honour paid, “Such is the Temper of the deadly Steel, “Nor the firm Marble, nor the rooted Oak, “Not Arms of Adamant its Touch can feel “Unmov'd, or bear the Fury of its Stroke: “No Earthly Wight its Contest may endure, “No Skill of Pharmacy its left Erasure cure. XLVI. “Yet strange, tho' true, its double Charms prevail, “With friendly Care to raise the vanquish'd Foe; “The fatal Wound the Hilt alone can heal, “And with immediate Ease relieve the Blow; “From the deep Gash, tho' stream'd the vital Flood, “And the wing'd Soul sate ready to depart; “Restrain'd, at once shall stop the issuing Blood, “With cordial Life again to warm the Heart! “Its Sov'reign Touch the Balm of Health restore, “As Mercy's gentle Hand allays the Rage of Pow'r. XLVII. “Nor judge, great Prince, the Gifts as ill assign'd, “Directed by our Califf's holy Views; “Safe is the Steed, in thy disposing Mind, “Whose Virtue never can his Pow'r abuse; “The Mirror well thy Consort may behold, “Reflecting all her Innocence sincere; “Well may the Ring the Daughter's Hand enfold, “Whose Soul is like the spotless Person, fair: “And aided by the Sword thy future Race, ‘Shall to the Toils of War, unite the Arts of Peace! XLVIII. Submiss he ceas'd:—when rising from his Throne The Monarch mild descending stretch'd his Hand, Well pleas'd the grateful Embassy to own, Borne by the Service of so wise a Hand: When thus:—“Kind Stranger! not the Voice of Fame, “That spreads its Sound diffus'd to either Poll; “Can raise the Lustre of our Califf's Name, “Or more endear his Virtues to my Soul: “In whom the Prophet's Viceroy I revere, “And with continued Joy, his daily Praises hear! XLIX. “His noble Gifts with Pleasure I receive, “Which secret Worth, and mystic Value boast “But more esteem the Faith he yields to give, “His Friendship ever wish'd and honour'd most. “Yet rare thy Presents and exceeding far, “The various Gems our eastern World brings forth. “The Ruby rich, the Diamond's mimick Star, “Or the unblemish'd Pearl of orient Worth, “Greatly beyond what Sarra's Regions lend, “Or all the Sylvan Spoils, her ample Forests send! L. “Welcome thy Presence on this festal Day, “To grace the Honours of our Royal Feast, “When Pleasure sits on ev'ry Aspect gay, “And in my People's Joy is mine confess'd: “Tho' us'd to better Cheer, which Heav'n bestows, “On Lands in happier Climes their Lot assign'd; “Where Bagdad rises, or where Tygris flows, “And Earth untaught is still benignly kind. “Where the mild Sun declines in Beauty gay, “Or Beams, with orient Charms to dress the Face of Day. LI. “Yet here till thy Return, the Greeting find, “Our barren Country yields the Toiler's Use; “Where Nature won, and by Compulsion kind, “Consents but coy to aid the slow Produce; “Yet such the Pow'r of the industrious Hand “That Year by Year the Soil more kindly grows, “Art pours new Beauties o'er the changing Land, “And by Degrees increasing Plenty flows, “Our Forests shrink, as new Plantations rise, “And Culture spreads new Fields to the delighted Skies. LII. “Mean time, associate at our Royal Board, “Accept the Cares our Gratitude would pay; “Freely command what Sarra can afford, “To ease the Labours of the tedious Way.” He ceas'd,—and smiling with a gracious Hand He plac'd the honour'd Stranger by his Side, While round the noblest Chiefs, a shining Band, Approach to welcome him with decent Pride. His courteous Speech and Manner all admire, And of the Syrian Court, the News they much enquire. LIII. Now plenteous had the gentle Envoy din'd, Pleas'd with the Treatment which the Monarch gave, When from the Zenith now the Sun declin'd, To cool his Ardors in the Caspian Wave; When thus the King—“Not here we boast the Means “To give thy Character the Honours due; “One easy Step to crown thy Toil remains, “Eastward our regal Castle stands in View, “There take thy Rest most welcome, and receive “That Friendship and Respect our Amity shall give. LIV. The Monarch rose,—th' officious Guard attend; The Knight with graceful Air his Courser leads, On Horseback, with the Tartar Prince ascends, And to the Palace all the Pomp proceeds: But most his Steed from the admiring Croud New Wonder drew, and much Enquiry rais'd: So stately was his Port, so firm he trod, That all his Gesture and Proportion prais'd; And own'd, of foreign and domestick Breed, Eye never yet had seen, a more majestick Steed. LV. Of due Dimensions was his mediate Size, While, loosly floating from his Swan-like Crest, Bright wav'd his Mane!—deep piercing were his Eyes, Strong were his Limbs, and broad his burnish'd Breast; Thick from his Nostrils breath'd the fiery Steam; His Tail behind a Length of Splendor flew; He seem'd to move within an Orb of Flame! So much appear'd the wondrous Object new, That all intent, pursue th' amazing Sight, So much does vulgar Minds all Novelty delight! LVI. Now to the Palace reach'd the Cavalcade, Where the strange Warrior and the King alight, And with his usual Grace, Cambuscan paid, Repeated Welcome to the Syrian Knight; Strict o'er his Horse's Neck the passive Reins With artificial Care the Envoy drew, When lo! all motionless the Form remains, Nor Life discover'd, nor Sensation knew: Fix'd as the Basis of the rocky Stone, The dead inactive Brass return'd a hollow Groan. LVII. They bear the Califf's Sword before the King, While to the Hall of State the Knight attends; Inward the Mirror and the mystick Ring To the Imperial Fair the Sultan sends; Kindly requiring to the present Feast The beauteous Queen and Princess may repair, With Royal Kindness to regale their Guest, And all the Rites of hospitable Care: That Syrian Dames, from his Report may know, That Gentleness can live amidst a Land of Snow! LVIII. Mean time without, around the famous Horse In Crowds the Usbeck City seems to spread; Much they survey his Make. and much discourse, As varied Notions fill the vulgar Head: To Magic some the strange Effects impute, Each to his Fancy forms a diff'rent Cause; Little they reason, greatly they dispute, And still the loudest most Attention draws: As Ignorance to Knowledge pores its Route, Never proceeds direct—but wanders still about! LIX. Like as a Swarm of Bees new-gath'ring play, Issuing advent'rous from their native Home; They spread thick murm'ring to the Evening-Ray, And yet of Habitation dubious roam; Till the wise Husbandman with tuneful Sound, Beneath the Shade the vagrant Tumult draws; They wandring, stop, and view the Dome around, And fix their Colony with loud Applause: So circling round the Horse, the Tartars croud, And speak their vast Surprize, with Acclamations loud! LX. Return we now, invited to the Hall, Where fairer Objects our Attendance claim; Such as are envy'd and admir'd by all, The graceful Courtier, and the beauteous Dame; What, tho' no Dances fir'd the Virgin chaste, Less charming did the mild Engagers seem? What, tho' no Smiles the Courtier's Brow defac'd, Less worthy was his Honour of Esteem? To us, indeed, such Manners wild may show, Where Dress creates a Belle, and Vanity a Beau! LXI. Yet as Restraint but fans the am'rous Fire, And Nature's Laws can never be suppress'd; So the soft Bosom heav'd with young Desire, And the fond Eye the tender Heart confess'd: Venus who then in Pisces held her Court, With friendly Rays beheld th' enamour'd Pair, Approv'd the Intercourse, and bless'd the Sport, Beyond my faint Description to declare: Her Arts the Roman Muse can better tell, For none should sing of Love, but those his Influence feel. LXII. Nor wanted cordial Drinks, or Viands rare To cheer the Soul and grace the Royal Feast; The gentle Empress made that Task her Care, With choicest Fare to treat the grateful Guest; But more than all her matchless Converse charm'd, Where Wisdom flow'd from the instructed Heart: Where beam'd kind Gentleness, and beaming warm'd With cunning Softness the attracted Heart. Scarce could the ravish'd Knight his Looks refrain; Or if she ceas'd, not wish the Joy commence again. LXIII. Oft to the King-unseen he turn'd his Eyes, Or in the Sons remark'd their Father's Air, Oft he beheld the Queen with new Surprize, But most the Princess amiably fair! The more he look'd he saw on each imprest The Marks of Majesty that awe the Sight, An Air of Greatness not to be express'd, Which calls for Homage, while it gives Delight; Something that more of Dignity confers, Then all the glittering Toys the ermin'd Monarch wears. LXIV. Hard to describe, whence springs this Air assign'd In Man and Brute to Excellence of Race; This outward Mark of a superior Mind, That seems to claim Precedency of Place; But that Experience shows by constant Course The noblest Animals their like create; From the selected Sire, the generous Horse, Derives his Fire, and springs from Earth elate! Hears the glad Trumpet calling from afar, And rapid pours his Flight amidst the Rage of War! LXV. In Man's imperial Race th' Effect's the same, Whatever Cause the like Distinction breeds; Whether from mutual Passion springs the Flame, Or Minds congenial stamp the vital Seeds? Else on extended Guinea's torrid Coast, Where the broad Mouth and Nose deprest prevail, In those who regal Blood and Lineage boast Why do the gen'ral Features rarely fail? Why shows the Austrian Lip the Austrian Line? And in some semblant Mark, the Hero loves to shine! LXVI. Now the shrill Trumpet warn'd the Flight of Day The loud Muëzin call'd to Ev'ning Pray'r; When rose Cambuscan, such his usual Way, With all his Court to Worship to repair. That Duty paid,—returning as they pass, Along the spacious Castle's outer Square The Sultan stop'd to view the Steed of Brass Incompass'd as he stood by Numbers there, And begs the Knight the Secret would disclose, To which the beauteous Form the Pow'rs of Motion owes. LXVII. To whom the Knight,—“O King! whose just Concern “Still nourishes Devotion's purest Flame; “Nor need I tell,—nor need thy Wisdom learn, “The Wonders wrought by the Almighty Name. “By this inspir'd our holy Prophet wrought, “Performances exceeding Reason's Line; “High Miracles beyond the Reach of Thought, “That Infidels might own the Faith Divine, “Whose Call the Earth and Air and Fire obey, “And the relentless Grave, and the unfathom'd Sea! LXVIII. “When taught by this, the slumb'ring Steed you wake; “Firm seize the Reins, and with this Pin secure; “Undaunted then the destin'd Journey take, “Thro' ev'ry Element the Course is sure. “Wouldst thou thy March continue or be still, “Touch but the Pin and whisper but the Word, “The Steed obedient shall observe thy Will, “Shall vanish at thy Call or stand restor'd, “Only the Bridle and the Pin retain, “Else lost is ev'ry Care, and every Project vain. LXIX So said,—he to the King's attentive Ear, With Rev'rence due the mystick Word unfolds; The Monarch bow'd, and with concealing Care The Word repeats, and fast the Bridle holds; Quick as Life's Current glides along the Veins, The warm Sensation so his Touch perceiv'd; That thaw'd the Stiffness of the brazen Reins, While the firm Chest with new Vibration heav'd: His Eyes their Fire resum'd, he rais'd his Head, And stately walk'd along, as pleas'd the Sultan led! LXX. Cambuscan much the gentle Steed caress'd, Thus grown familiar to his leading Hand, The gentle Steed an equal Joy confess'd, To serve the generous Monarch's just Command: Much to the num'rous Court assembled round The King his Shape and his Behaviour prais'd, The Court applauding still return'd the Sound, And all the Voice of Admiration rais'd: Till from his Neck the Reins at once he drew, And vanish'd quick the Steed from ev'ry Mortal's View! LXXI. The Sword and Bridle with peculiar Care, Deputed Nobles by the King's Command, Safe to the Castle's strongest Fortress bear, Where all the Monarch's ample Treasures stand; The Royal Company direct return, In social Mirth to crown the happy Night; While round perfum'd a thousand Tapers burn And the whole Palace seems illumin'd bright, The Feast renews, the Converse sprightly grows, And Chearfulness around her balmy Influence throws. LXXII. The worthy King, whose long experienc'd Years Had made him judge of Manners and of Minds, Pleas'd with the Syrian's Converse much appears, For Virtue soon its own Resemblance finds: Some secret Sympathy of Nature draws, With its coercive Bands the noble Soul; As Unisons accord harmonious Cause, Or the fondle Needle trembles to its Pole! Tis thus each other know the truly Great, Without the tedious Forms inferior Friendships wait. LXXIII. Mean time between the Princes rose Debate About the wond'rous Steed the Envoy brought, Algarsife urging, with his usual Heat, The Motion some informing Genie wrought: But cool Camballo with a sceptic Air, Seem'd to believe the Secret lay within, That hid remain'd the Springs of Action there, And mov'd or ceas'd directed by the Pin: Each brings new Proofs the other to confute, Till to the Monarch's Ear arriv'd the warm Dispute. LXXIV. Silent a while the King Reflection made And saw the Point not easy to decide; Till kind Remembrance usher'd to his Aid, A hoary Sage, whose Skill he oft had try'd: By Birth a Mede, but whose enquiring Sight Each Region of the travell'd East had known, Wisdom the Object sole of his Delight, And the whole Sphere of Knowledge seem'd his own. Nor read in Books alone, his generous Mind, Embrac'd with cordial Zeal the Welfare of Mankind. LXXV. The various Faiths the peopled World divide Justly impartial had his Thought survey'd; Reason his Standard still, and Truth his Guide, Nor Interest, Prejudice or Passion weigh'd: The Magi's Books he knew, the Brachmin's Lore, Th' Egyptian Figure, the Jewish Rite, The Christian Law, intended to restore, But now defac'd by Superstition quite: With the mix'd Plan th' Arabian Prophet drew, O'er Asia now which spread, as new Religions do. LXXVI. He saw, that Nature thro' her wide Command, O'er all her Works diffus'd one equal Smile, Nor kept the Bounties of her lavish Hand, Confin'd to this or that peculiar Soil: He knew, that vain was ev'ry Art, design'd To check the Freedom of the humane Will; That no Restraints could shackle up the Mind, Which, self-determin'd, kept her Empire still: And in th' extended Scene of humane Race, As varied were the Thoughts, as various was the Face! LXXVII. Hence Casroes (so the Median Sage's Name) This healing Principle reflective drew; Others Opinions candid not to blame, But calm the Paths of Wisdom to pursue! Pleas'd with the little Nature's Hand requires, Wealth, Honour, Pleasures, Titles he disdain'd; Few were his Wants, as mod'rate his Desires, The happy Master of himself he reign'd! A Joy, to all but Minds serene, unknown, Beyond the Wreaths of Fame, or Splendors of a Throne, LXXVIII. On a fair Bank, by Oxus winding Shore, Inclos'd with Wood, a little Spot he found; There had he fix'd his Rest—and greatly poor, Liv'd on the Fruits of his domestic Ground: Oft had Cambuscan, tir'd with Cares of State, Sought the Refreshment of his little Cave; There philosophic held the cool Debate, Nor scorn'd the Counsels which his Wisdom gave. Whose Life reveal'd the Value of his Art, And to the learned Head was join'd the honest Heart. LXXIX. For him immediate then the Sultan sends, His seasonable Presence to require; The worthy Sage the Messenger attends, And comes obedient to the King's Desire. His Head with Age's Frost was silver'd o'er, But on his Check still blush'd the temp'rate Rose. Decent, tho' plain, a flowing Robe he wore, And manly Dignity his Person shows. For such his Carriage seem'd, and gentle Port, As if his Life had been no Stranger to a Court. LXXX. The Syrian Knight (for so requests the King) The Nature of the Califf's Gifts explains; The Horse, the Sword, the Mirror, and the Ring, And points the Qualities which each retains: When thus Cambuscan—“Cosroes! O declare, “For best the Truth thy Wisdom can impart, “Whence boast these Presents such Perfection rare? “From Nature springs the Secret, or from Art? “Or animates the Steed some Pow'r divine? “Or do mechanic Wheels direct the bold Design? LXXXI. To whom the Sage—“Not, mighty Prince, we boast, “Of such mysterious Gifts to judge the Cause: “Least knows the Wisest, when he knows the most, “Of Matter's Properties, and Motion's Laws: “Form'd of two Principles distinguish'd quite, “We find distinctly our corporeal Frame: “Spirit, we know, with Matter can unite; “Yet search in vain from whence the Union came, “Or, where subsists invisible the Tye, “Which fastens Life it self, and losing which we die. LXXXII. “What gives Commission to the Wintry War, “When the loud Storm enchafes the troubled Deep, “Or sooths to Peace the Elemental Jar, “And hushes the relenting Winds to sleep! “What causes the pale Moon's alternate Light, “By turns replenish, and by turns decay, “Fair as she glides along the Face of Night! “And shapes thro' mazy Clouds her pathless Way. “Or from what Origin those Clouds ascend, “In vain our feeble Sense would strive to comprehend. LXXXIII. “All the Phenomena of boundless Air, “Which strike with Wonder the unsettl'd Eye, “The Meteors flash, the Comets ruddy Glare, “Or the loud Thunder bursting from the Sky! “The dark Eclipse, when o'er the Orb of Day “Its gloomy Stain prevailing Darkness sheds; “The shining Bow, whose variegated Ray “O'er the pale Cloud its painted Circlet spreads! “In vain our low Researches would pursue, “With weak defective Schemes of Science still untrue. LXXXIV. “Yet Science sees direct—far as it may, “While Ignorance in endless Darkness pores; “Safe treads the Sage, where Reason points the Way “One sov'reign Cause discovers and adores! “The further that in Nature's Road he treads, “He sees eternal Wisdom guide the Whole! “The more the glitt'ring Page of Heav'n he reads, “He feels that Wisdom penetrate the Soul! “And what the Vulgar view with careless Eyes, “Silent contemplates He with Pleasure and Surprize, LXXXV. “Matter he sees, as struggling to a Birth, “Thro' all its elemental Forms aspire; “Earth rise from Water, Air refine from Earth, “To mount, and purify it self in Fire! “Fire! the first Principle, whose vital Ray, “Heat, Motion, Sense, and Life productive breeds, “That circling from th' exhaustless Source of Day, “Wakens from Death the dull material Seeds; “That to it self attractive, all invites, “Till in the Parent-Cause Creation fond unites! LXXXVI. “This, sure, we know,—that Matter has its Laws, “By which impell'd, the stubborn Mass obeys; “That secret Sympathy some Objects draws, “And by its Pow'r can seeming Wonders raise! “Hence, would it seem, that this mysterious Horse, “Tho' form'd to Semblance of material Mold, “Is taught to move by sympathetic Force, “And to perform at Will the Actions told; “As the Greek Pegasus was fam'd to bear, “The bold Bellerophon through Tracts of boundless Air. LXXXVII. “Hence taught, the Sage to Matter can infuse “New Qualities to suit his just Design; “Can shape the Mass subservient to his Views, “And give the Workmanship a Stamp divine! “Thus, in the honour'd Califf's precious Sword “Opposing Virtues may their Influence shed; “The Hilt, may salutary Balm afford, “To close the Wound the Edge relentless made. “As fam'd Achilles' Spear confess'd the Art, “To cure th' inflicted Stroke, and ease the deadly Smart. LXXXVIII. “Thus may the Mirror, and the mystic Ring “The gentle Knight's Description well maintain; “From planetary Skill their Virtues spring, “Which only deep-read Science can attain: “As o'er affrighted Misraim's fertile Land, “The Wand of Moses Desolation spread, “Or grac'd the Signet Salomon's right Hand, “Whose Pow'r could wake the Slumbers of the Dead: “Could from the Eye remove the Veil of Night, “And place the Realms of Spirit to th' astonish'd Sight! LXXXIX. “But while, Cambuscan! thou exalt thy Head, “In peaceful Sway and foreign Friendships blest, “Remember Heav'n, that all thy Greatness made, “Nor let weak Pride pollute thy Royal Breast! “All that we see in Life's deceitful Dream, “Like us, the vain Spectators, glides away! “Only great Orosmanes shines the same, “Unwasted Fountain of eternal Day! “Who in himself all Nature comprehends, “From whom all Beings spring, in whom all Being ends. XC. He ceas'd—attentive as the Syrian Knight Heard the sweet Accents flowing from his Tongue, And felt within such exquisite Delight, He had not thought a Summer's Audience long. The Monarch Thanks return'd—th' applauding Croud With common Voice repeat the Sage's Praise: Night now began to spread her heavy Shroud, And call the weary'd Limbs to needful Ease: Cambuscan rose—the Court retire to Rest, And on her midnight Throne deep Silence reigns confest. XCI. O gentle Sleep! thou Cherisher of Health! From Temp'rance bred, the Nurse of sweet Repose! In whom the Peasant finds a Mine of Wealth! To whom his Happiness the Lover owes! Thou Balm of Life! whose kindly Warmth restores Light to the Eyes, and Vigour to the Heart! Whose Presence Luxury in vain implores, Kind while thou fly'st to take Afflictions part! Say, by what magic Fetters dost thou bind In thy delightful Thrall the agitated Mind? XCII. Inthron'd on mazy Oxus' verdant Shore, We left thee, Goddess, of thy Sway possest; Cambuscan's Palace felt thy peaceful Pow'r, And thro' the Gloom thy Influence sate confest: Fair Dreams, thy beauteous Handmaids, all around To ev'ry Guest thy busy Mandates spred; Each, by their Ministry, contented found, The sep'rate Joy to which their Wishes led: Soft am'rous Vows th' unblushing Virgin hears, And to the Warriors View the glitt'ring Camp appears! XCIII. Thee, placid Queen of Night—the Sultan own'd, In shining Visions of recover'd Arms! Thou, to the Syrian lengthen'd Wisdom's Sound, And Cosroës still his fix'd Attention charms: But most the Tartar Princess claim'd thy Care, To sooth the soft Impatience of her Breast; Her curious Thoughts the Ring's Impression bear, And new Ideas interrupt her Rest, In Fancy she surveys the Sylvan Scenes, And hears the feather'd Choirs—and learns their tuneful Strains! XCIV. Calm were her usual Slumbers wont to be: Calm as the Current of her temp'rate Blood; Calm as her blameless Soul, from Passions free, That knew no Evil, and that wish'd all Good! Yet something—whence she knew not, what or how, Invasive now infected her Repose: She felt soft Quiet vanish from her Brow, And e're the Morning dawn'd, the Princess rose! She calls her Virgin-Train, who near remain'd, And instant at her Call her Virgin-Train attend, XCV. Great was their Fright, and obvious their Concern, What Cause so soon their gentle Mistress rais'd; Till from her self inform'd, her Health they learn, And by her Smiles they find their Fears appeas'd; But chief Olinda—more a Friend than Slave, Whom from Podolia lawless Rapine drew; Whom to his Daughter great Cambuscan gave, By Purchase his, e're yet her self she knew: Whose modest Worth had gain'd the Princess' Ear, By long experienc'd Tyes of faithful Duty dear! XCVI. Now rosy Morn, the Harbinger of Day, Beam'd o'er the azure Hills with Radiance bright! Awak'ning Nature felt the gladsome Ray, And smil'd as conscious of approaching Light; When the fair Princess issu'd to the Plain, Attended by a Band of lovely Maids; Such Cynthia, when amidst her sportive Train, Her early Horn resounds in Latmos' Shades: Cloth'd in a lightsome Dress; thus bends her Way, To grace the flow'ry Field, this charming Queen of May! XCVII. By Oxus' Side, engirt with Wood-brow'd Hills, A spacious Compass lay the Sylvan Scene! Thro' which clear-streaming ran two mazy Rills, That fed the Soil with ever-living Green; But as the Ground unequal check'd the View, So by degrees its varied Beauties rose; Dales, Rocks or Groves form Landskips ever new, And blending Prospects new Delights disclose. Nature unrival'd here maintain'd her Part, Too sweetly wild for Chance, too greatly bold for Art. XCVIII. From teeming Earth the Vapour now exhal'd; That courts the Presence of the orient Sun; But thro' the Mist the ruddy Orb prevail'd, All warm with Joy, his daily Course to run! By the clear River stretch'd the winding Vale, Where, as it often chanc'd, the Princess stray'd, A thousand Sweets embalm'd the spicy Gale, A thousand Flow'rs luxuriant bless'd the Mead, Which, as her Virgins sport, they pull with Care The Morning-Wreath to form, for Canace to wear. XCIX. There safe the Elk, the Antilope, and Deer The harmless Shelter of the Place enjoy'd; Crop'd the sweet Herb, or drank the Fountain clear; No Fears alarm'd them; for no Foes annoy'd: With vocal Musick now the Forests ring, As artless Love inspires the melting Voice: And Nature kindling at the Smile of Spring, Teaches her happy Children to rejoice! Fair Canace the soft Sensation feels, And with the whisp'ring Breeze the virtuous Pleasure steals! C. As from the native Blind's unconscious Eyes, The skilful Leech th' assailing Speck withdraws; Sudden he sees a World unknown arise, Where Objects multiply'd Confusion cause: With such Emotion did the Princess' Ear Receive the Language of the Woods around: So, by her mystic Ring instructed, hear, That not devoid of Reason was the Sound: While with responsive Note the Nations sing, “Hail to the Rose of May! Hail, lovely Queen of Spring! CI. But stop we here, e're too prolix we be; The wanton Error, That of many a Muse, Who lur'd by ev'ry Flow'r, and ev'ry Tree, Too far the too inviting Path pursues. Lest the tir'd Ear reject the tedious Strain, Judgment should still the Flights of Fancy guide. The Point propos'd should Reason firm retain, That Fame may o'er the lasting Work preside. Mind we, th' unerring Law of sacred Song, That the delightful Tale should never be too long. CII. But as she nearer to the Forest drew, A diff'rent Object claim'd her gentle Care Of Foliage stript, alone, an Alder grew, Whose naked Branches trembled to the Air! From hence shrill Cries a beauteous Falcon sent, Which well her Bitterness of Woe express'd; While ever as she shriek'd, with cruel Bent, She fix'd her Beak impressive in her Breast; So that the Tide of Life, fast flowing round, Distain'd the wither'd Bark, and trinkled to the Ground. CIII. Fair seem'd her Form, and fair her Aspect seem'd, As ever Eye beheld, or Falcon wore; Like the pure Snow, her Silver Plumage beam'd, With mingling ruddy Streaks empurpled o'er! Such was her Look, that not the Tyger fell, Who lawless roams the Desart wild for Prey; Nor Eagle fierce, that from her airy Cell, Wings with destructive Aim her rapid Way; But would have soften'd been to hear her Lay, And by Compassion taught, have felt their Rage decay. CIV. Mov'd with the plaintive Anguish of her Tongue, Her mournful Gesture, and her bleeding Wound; The neighb'ring Birds from ev'ry Thicket throng, And silent hear, and droop the Wing around! Soon the mild Princess, thro' her tender Soul, Felt the prevailing Force of Pity glide; The Voice of Sorrow all her Senses stole, As from the Tree, distinct the Falcon cry'd; “O gentle Stranger, some Compassion show! “O heavenly Beauty deign to ease my matchless Woe. CV. Quick to the Tree, the gentle Princess flew Where still her sad Laments the Mourner made; And in the Falcon's Tongue (which then she knew) With Accent mild, and tender Look she said: “Much suffering Bird! the fairest of thy Kind! “Whate'er Misfortunes thus thy Anguish move; “In me, the Daughter of a Monarch, find “A Friend, with me a sure Protection prove: “My Hands thy Wounds shall heal with precious Balm, “And on my Breast reclin'd, thy Woes shall know a Calm. CVI. “But why thy Breast this boundless Sorrow fills, “Which sighing Eccho wafts the Woods around? “Why from thy Breast the crimson Drop distills “That mars the Verdure of the blasted Ground? “If Death has robb'd thee of thy slaughter'd Mate, “For whom despairing, comfortless you show; “Or if some envious Shaft with cruel Fate “Has pierc'd thy Bosom with a deadly Blow? “Oh quick the Cause reveal!—for never yet, “On one of feather'd Kind, so was my Fancy set! CVII. Scarce had she spoke,—when from the lifeless Spray, Where perch'd the Falcon did her Griefs repeat The fluttering Mourner fell, and panting lay, As pleas'd to die beneath the Princess' Feet! Soon from the Earth the Bird her Pity rais'd, And in her Lap with fond Indulgence plac'd; Then call'd her Maids, who on the Action gaz'd, And bound its Wounds and tenderly embrac'd: Till by her Hands reviv'd the Falcon woke, Grateful beheld the Fair and faintly thus bespoke. CVIII. “O blest Compassion! Heav'n descended Child! “Whose Power is best perceiv'd in noblest Hearts “Who dress'd in Smiles of Patience, meekly mild, “To Want, Relief; to Mis'ry, Ease imparts; “By thee inspir'd,—this heavenly Maid has felt “A Pain for Sorrows to herself unknown; “With kind Humility has Comfort dealt, “To me, amidst the Wilds of Nature thrown! “For which may Guardian Heav'n her Virtues shield “From all the poison'd Arts, that drove me to the Field. CIX. “Yet tho' Reflection should convey a Dart “With every Word to wing my fleeting Life; “The Story of my Woe shall I impart “At thy Command, and bear the cruel Strife: “So may the sad Relation be believ'd, “Which from Experience deeply wounded flows, “That thy superior Virtue undeceiv'd, “May scorn the Semblance faithless Manhood shows, “Their Vows, their Sighs, and all the flatt'ring Arts “By which (they skill'd) betray deluded Virgin-Hearts! CX. She ceas'd,—as if oppress'd,—nor longer spoke With sad Remembrance inward so she pain'd; She droop'd her Head,—a Flood of Anguish broke And scarce her Form the Signs of Life retain'd; While Canace bestow'd a tender Tear, To see the wretched Falcon's halpless State; With Kisses oft she sought her Griefs to cheer, Caress'd her gently, and bewail'd her Fate! Till Kindness does reviving Warmth infuse, And thus the pensive Bird the Song of Woe renews. CXI. “Where rapid Niester rolls his noisy Wave, “High in a Marble Cliff that brow'd the Flood; “My peaceful Birth indulgent Nature gave, “Securely there our Nest paternal stood: “I liv'd my honour'd Parents dear delight, “Cherish'd with Sylvan Fruits and choicest Grain; “My Youth they form'd, and taught my early Flight. “To skim the Wood, or circle o'er the Plain! “Of all the numerous Natives of the Sky, “None, (so bethought me) seem'd so blest and glad as I. CXII. “By Fortune favour'd, and by Nature free, “Artless I flew where Health and Pleasure call'd; “No Fears alarm'd, no Dangers threatned me; “No Sickness griev'd, nor Servitude inthrall'd: “Form'd to Sincerity my honest Thought “No Guile imagin'd, as no Guile it knew; “Too fond Belief!—which future Mischiefs wrought, “And into Woe my heedless Footsteps drew: “For such the Fate of the most candid Mind, “True Honour needs no Vows,—no Vows can Falshood bind. CXIII. “Not distant far, by the descending Stream, “A Tercelet held his wood-enshelter'd Nest; “Much of his Manners spoke propitious Fame, “As ev'ry Virtue had adorn'd his Breast; “Thus prepossess'd,—delighted I beheld “So full of gentle Courtesy he seem'd, “All former Observation stood excell'd, “I saw,—admir'd;—reflected,—and esteem'd: “Nor judg'd such Carriage with destructive Show, “Conceal'd a darksome Well of Treason hid below! CXIV. “As where gay Flowers in wild Profusion rise, “Th' embosom'd Serpent glides his wiley Head! “Replete with Malice till the Time he spies, “When unperceiv'd he may his Venom shed: “So with fair Semblance of unfelt Delight, “This sly Deceiver constant Duty paid; “Early or late he faithful watch'd my Flight, “With Zeal conducted, and with Care obey'd: “So us'd each Artifice my Heart to move “This Monster of his Kind!—this Hypocrite in Love. CXV. “Yet, while his Tenderness my Mind surveys, “I wonder not that foolish, I believ'd! “Yet, when I think on his engaging Ways, “I scarce know how to call my self deceiv'd! “So upright to Appearance his Intent, “So far his Conduct seem'd from selfish View, “Dishonour might have wonder'd what it meant, “And blush'd to wear a Livery so true! “So fair to Light the stately Tomb remains, “That in its loathsome Vault the Spoils of Death contains. CXVI. “Thus for successive Years with humble Air, “This Wretch disloyal holy Love profan'd; “With constant Vows still won my open Ear, “'Till by Degrees my yielding Mind he gain'd: “To hear his plaintive Tale beneath the Shade, “Pleas'd have I oft consum'd the Summer's Day! “Still the fond Tale a fresh Impression made “And more enamour'd still I went away! “With female Pride prevailing Pity strove, “And what was Friendship first, now soften'd into Love. CXVII. “Yet in my Weakness,—Virtue still I ey'd! “Nor lost its native Purity my Heart! “Love, tho' he fetter'd,—led me not aside, “And Virgin Chastity maintain'd its Part; “Tho' Choice inthron'd him in my conscious Breast. “The best,—the dearest of his noble Kind, “Lord of my Wishes, tho' he reign'd confest “His Empire still was bounded by the Mind “In me, unblemish'd Honour lent the Fire “The mutual Flame to feed,—I thought should ne'er expire. CXVIII. “Thus won by seeming Love! and vain Desert, “My Mind deluded grasp'd its fatal Chain! “I fear'd no Treachery, void of ev'ry Art, “Lov'd as I was, I joy'd to love again! So, in the Sight of Heav'n and conscious Day, “We mutual, one unalter'd Passion swore; “Ne'er did till then the Traitor seem so gay, “Ne'er felt my harmless Breast such Joy before: “As when I yielded all my Heart as free, “As simple I believ'd, he his had given to me! CXIX. “But well this Truth prophetic Love has read, “A Thief and faithful Lover think not one.” “For soon as he beheld his Conquest made, “Increasing Show of Transport he put on; “Before my Feet in seeming Trance he lay, “And tho' deep Silence all his Speech suppress'd, “With false Delight I saw his Pinions play, “And his fond Eye his Happiness confess'd. “Convinc'd, to Demonstration, I remain'd, “No mortal Lover yet so well the Passion feign'd! CXX. “Not Paris, who th' Idalian Nymph betray'd; “Not Troilus, who inconstant Cresside won; “Not Jason, who deceiv'd the Colchian Maid; “Nor Lamech; first who chose two Wives for one; “Not Adam, who for one his Eden lost, “With all the Sons of his degen'rate Race, “Could equal Art with this Impostor boast, “Or act the Counterfeit with such a Grace. “Such was his specious Shadowing of Disguise, “No Woman had escap'd, had she been e'er so wise! CXXI. “No wonder then, if I, all unadvis'd, “Whom no Experience caution'd to beware; “If unsuspecting, I was soon surpriz'd, “And heedless caught in the delusive Snare: “If simple, charm'd with Love's attractive Show, “Its new-born Pleasure, and deceitful Sweet, “My Heart unguarded, open'd to the Foe, “And cherish'd in itself the fatal Heat; “Our Thoughts, our Pains, our Wishes seem'd the same; “New Love appear'd to raise a more enduring Flame! CXXII. “Thus twice the Sun renew'd the smiling Year, “And saw our mutual soft Endearments crown'd. “His Sight, my Bliss! his Safety, all my Fear! “In him was ev'ry other Object drown'd! “Had I a Sigh he seem'd not to divide? “Had he a Pain, I made not all my own? “I held him more than all the World beside; “I liv'd—I wish'd to live for him alone! “Dearer he was to me in ev'ry Part, “Than was the vital Stream that circled round my Heart! CXXIII. “Near the lone Ruins of a wasted Tow'r, “Encompass'd by the River's murm'ring Fall, “Oft were we wont to pass the Ev'ning-Hour, “Safe in the Shelter of the Ivy'd Wall; “There was our Meeting fix'd, that hapless Day, “Happy, whose Light these Eyes had never seen, “Slow pass'd to me the tedious Time away, “Till the deep Shadows darken'd half the Green; “Impatient, I observ'd the Night's Increase, “And e're th' appointed Time I wing'd me to the Place. CXXIV. “There I the Traytor found,—who pensive stood, “Perch'd on a Turret, as to mark my Flight; “Sad seem'd his Aspect!—drooping was his Mood; “Ne'er had I seen him in such heavy Plight. “Trembling, I ask'd the Cause; but ask'd in vain, “Foreboding; Silencegave me nought to know. “I press him to reply, Whence rose his Pain? “His Eyes responsive only told his Woe: “'Till with a forc'd Constraint, and piercing Look; “His feeble Voice he rais'd; and thus prepar'd, he spoke. CXXV. “Hard is the Lot, the bolder Male attends, “Where Dangers threat, by Honor forc'd to go, “While Nature kind your softer Sex defends, “And Guardian-Beauty shields from ev'ry Blow. “Love, weeping Love, can tell with what Regret “Reluctant I obey the Tyrant-Guide; “How much I wail the Rigour of my Fate, “That tears me, gentle Charmer! from thy Side. “Judge thou the Strife, and with impartial Aim, “Save (if thou canst) my Peace, or vindicate my Fame. CXXVI. He ceas'd—unusual Horror seiz'd my Breast, A mix'd Confusion, never felt before! Scarce my dim Eye the rising Grief repress'd, I lov'd his Safety,—but his Honor more! When Death prevailing rends the tortur'd Heart, And hovers o'er the Sight his dreadful Shade, Such at that Instant was my speechless Smart! Such was the Anguish on my Senses prey'd! Firm, as I could, I yet witheld a Cry, And thoughtful thus I made, determin'd, my Reply. CXXVII. “Tho' Love can ill this sudden Shock sustain, “And never Love as yet exceeded mine! “Yet since thy Glory calls thee from the Plain, “Content I sacrifice my Will to thine! “Complaints are vain!—where Fame invites thee, go, “Yet for my Sake, amidst the Warrior-Strife, “Heav'n from thy Head avert each pointed Blow, “And with thy Safety bring me more than Life! “For this, each Morning-Orison shall rise; “For this, each Ev'ning-Hymn invoke the Guardian Skies. CXXVIII. “Yet tho' harsh Fate for Years prolong'd thy Stay, “Love constant shall supply my faithful Flame. “Then, as if lost but the preceding Day, “Still wilt thou find my Tenderness the same. “When the pure Soul a chaste Affection binds, “Nor Time, nor Death the Union can impair! “Heav'n pleas'd surveys this Sympathy of Minds, “That, like itself, enkindles brightly fair! “Fly then to Conquest—Fortune be thy Guide! “Of this assur'd, no Pow'r our Faith shall e'er divide. CXXIX. “What need I, Princess fair! describe his Shows, “His varied Action, and his fond Discourse? “His Vows repeated, and dissembled Woes? “Who cou'd speak better? Who cou'd practise worse? “Such was his Agony—so deep his Cries; “Such all the Shapes of his experienc'd Art! “That more instructed Thought, and wiser Eyes, “Perhaps had seen, he over-did his Part. “But Innocence my weaker Judgment bound, “None Treason well can know, but who has Treason found! CXXX. “Doleful we parted on the Gloom of Night, “With weary Wing my wind-rock'd Nest I sought; “He vig'rous, southward urg'd his rapid Flight, “With new Direction, and inconstant Thought! “Well had he learn'd this Maxim of Mankind, “That no Restraint the Appetite cou'd cool; “That the soft Passion languishes confin'd; “But when directed, free by Beauty's Rule, “(As Fancy leads) exerts a nobler Aim; “With Novelty supplies the still reviving Flame! CXXXI. “Like as the foolish Bird, who wild in-cag'd, “(Tho' kind you tend him, and tho' fond you feed) “Yet bears his Loss of Liberty enrag'd, “Nor all your gentle Usage deigns to heed: “Were you to line his Prison-Bars with Silk, “Disdainful shall he tear the Trophies up; “Were you to mix his Mess of honey'd Milk, “He loaths the Dainties, and he spurns the Cup. “But give him Leave,—the Libertine shall rove, “To feed on vilest Worms, a Vagrant in the Grove. CXXXII. “Twas so this Tercelet, whom I once esteem'd, “A Miracle of Constancy and Truth, “(Such as in Virtue counterfeit he seem'd “With all the Splendor of unblemish'd Youth!) “Fir'd by no Prospect of superior Fame, “But led by vain Desire of wanton Change, “He shun'd my Sight, forgot his ancient Flame, “In search of lawless Pleasure, wild to range. “A wretched Kyte had struck his fickle Eye; “A Kyte! the coarsest Bird that wings the midway Sky! CXXXIII. “So spoke Report—nor I the Tale believ'd, “So much my Heart was wedded to its Foe; “Till by my own Enquiry undeceiv'd, “My Error late I found, I found it so! “Then first I knew, not Love the Passion bred, “Whose Semblance fair this Hypocrite express'd; “But Phantasy the idle Vapour fed. “A Meteor vain of Gallantry at best. “A real Tenderness can ne'er decline; “Of genuine Virtue still is Constancy the Sign. CXXXIV. “Thus now this Kyte my Wanderer enjoys, “Forgetful of his violated Vows; “More artful she, perhaps, her Pow'r employs, “To seize the kind Occasions Love allows! “To try if real be the Wooer's Pain, “By Wiles that ev'n his Artifice may blind; “To practise Coyness, and to act Disdain, “Arts never suited to my plainer Mind; “Whose Innocence alone supports its Grief, “Till Heav'n shall end my Woe, or timely send Relief! CXXXV. More had she spoke,—but as she thus bewail'd, Prevailing Anguish gain'd the dubious Sway; Short grew her Breath! her little Spirits fail'd, And in the Princess' Lap she dy'd away! Mov'd, at the Sight, the Nymphs with busy Care, To give the Mourner and their Mistress Ease; Who safe conveys her from the dang'rous Air, And homeward with a gentle Pace conveys; Where in her own Apartment safely plac'd, The wounded Bird she leaves, its just Repose to taste! CXXXVI. Next Canace humane her Thought bestows, From ev'ry potent Herb and Root to chuse Ingredients bland, the Med'cine to compose, And in the Sores the Balm of Health infuse: Recov'ring soon, beneath her watchful Eye The gentle Bird a fairer Face assumes, Her Wounds reclose—she shows external Joy, And with new Life her varied Plumage blooms. Grateful, her fair Deliv'rer is confess'd, She sips her rosy Lip, and flutters round her Breast! CXXXVII. Yet but imperfect Pleasure she reveal'd, A Cloud of Anguish darken'd still her Mien; In vain with fond Endeavour she conceal'd The melancholy Grief that reign'd within: With friendly Zeal the gen'rous Princess strove To cure this deeper Wound which Sorrow made, To cool the Fever of consuming Love, Which slowly-wasting on her Quiet prey'd: And sought, by Reason calm, and mild Discourse, To mitigate the deep Disease's rooted Force. CXXXVIII. Close by her fair Alcove's projected Side, She for the fav'rite Bird, a Mew prepares; Adorn'd with all the Elegance of Pride; Of Gold the Wires, of Gold the fretted Bars: In Gold the crystal Ewer she encas'd, A figur'd Vase of Gold contain'd her Food; Her Cage around with golden Foliage grac'd, Of Gold the polish'd Perch on which she stood; Hung o'er a Canopy of Velvet-Blue, The Emblem sweet of Hope, and Perseverance true! CXXXIX. Full in a rich Entablature oppos'd, Depicted was there many a faithless Fowl; There in their proper Colours stood disclos'd The fickle Tercelet, and the treach'rous Owl. The Caitiff Cuckoo flew attended there, Whom all the feather'd Tribes avoid with Scorn; Nor fail'd the tell-tale Daw, or prattling Stare The Enigmatick Portrait to adorn: High in the Centre was the Jeay espy'd, Who ap'd their sev'ral Airs—well practis'd to deride. CXL. Here shall we leave, how by Camballo's Care, Return'd the Falcon with repentant Wing; Nor yet the Mirror's wond'rous Pow'rs declare; Nor the Sword's Virtues, to restore the King; Nor of Cambuscan's Conquests yet discourse; Whence gain'd Algarsife, Thedora to wife, Great Peril 'scaping, thro' the Brazen Horse: These we defer—to tell Camballo's Strife, And how three mighty Brethren he surpass'd; Then where we first began, shall we conclude at last. Cætera multa desiderantur. CXLI. Wide spred the Fame of Canace the Fair, Held of her Sex most learned in her Days; Her Ring disclosing ev'ry Science rare, And ev'ry secret Work of Nature's Ways. The Voice of Beasts and Birds, or wild, or tame, The Pow'r of Herbs and Plants she fully knew; But What augmented more her other Fame, (Tho' dark Events lay open to her View,) She modest was, in all her Deeds and Words; And wondrous chaste of Life, tho' lov'd of Knights and Lords. What follows is continued by Mr. Ogle, from the Fourth Book of Spenser's Fairy Queen. CXLII. Her many a Lord, and many a Knight Her lov'd; But She to None of Them her Liking lent; Nor ever was with fond Affection mov'd; No single Look once out of Order went; So well her Thoughts all lawless Passions rul'd, For Love of Honor, or for Dread of Blame; And, or extinguish'd quite, or duly cool'd, She smother'd, or She never felt the Flame; Her Eyes like wary Centinels well stay'd, Still watch'd on ev'ry Side, of secret Foes afraid. CXLIII. So much the rather, as She shun'd to love, So much the rather, She to love was sought; What fail'd not much unquiet Strife to move, And 'midst her Suitors frequent Contests wrought. That oft for Her in bloody Arms They fight, Encountring Danger for the thankless Maid; Whom, when Camballo (wise and valiant Knight!) Perceiv'd, He nor could temper, nor dissuade; From Ills, He could not help, He cast to raise, And turn both Him and Her to Honor and to Praise. CXLIV. One Day, that met this Troop of warlike Merit, Amongst Them All He made this fix'd Decree; (All Men of Passion, and all Men of Spirit! The harder so to make Them well agree!) “Be this the Hour, to fix my Sister's Choice, “Be, of the Croud, that to her Bed pretend, “Three chose, the Stoutest call'd by common Voice, “The Stoutest of the Three the Strife shall end. “Then Each with Me shall combat for her Sake; “The Victor of Them All our Canace shall take. CXLV. Bold was the Challenge, as Himself was bold, With Courage full of Daring and Emprize, Approv'd in Acts too num'rous to be told, Whence lasting Honors to his Mem'ry rise. But what secur'd Him of the wish'd Event, Whence, tho' full brave, some Confidence might spring, Was the sure Aid his Royal Sister lent, The Influence of her rarely-gifted Ring; That 'mongst the many Virtues (which We read) Had Pow'r to staunch all Wounds that mortaly did bleed. CXLVI. So was that Ring's great Virtue known to All; That Dread of This, and his redoubted Might, Did all that youthly Rout so much appall, That None of Them durst undertake the Fight. More wise They ween'd to make of Love a Play, Than Life to hazard for fair Lady's Grace; While yet uncertain (should They gain the Day) They in her Sight might hope the foremost Place. Tho' for her Sake, They all that Peril ran, Who could be sure of Her, or think Himself the Man? CXLVII. Among the Lovers, were three Brethren bold— Three bolder Brethren never yet were born! Born of one Mother, in one happy Mold! Born at one Burthen, in one happy Morn! Thrice happy Morn, thrice happy Mother, hail! That brought Three such, Three such not to be found; Three Males united as one single Male! The First was Priamondo, far renown'd; Nor less the Second, Diamondo nam'd; With Triamondo last, yet, equally as fam'd. CXLVIII. Stout Priamondo, not so strong to strike! Strong Diamondo, not so stout a Knight! But Priamondo, stout and strong alike! On Horse wou'd Triamondo chuse to fight; Felt Priamondo best on Foot his Force, And so delighted to maintain his Ground; To Diamondo, equal Foot or Horse. With Curtax deep wou'd Diamondo wound; And Triamondo handled Spear and Shield; But Curtax, Shield and Spear would Priamondo wield. CXLIX. These Brothers lov'd Each Other wond'rous well, And by such firm Affection were ally'd, As if one Soul might in three Bosoms dwell, And in three equal Parts her Pow'rs divide. Like three fair Arms, uniting as They spread, That, from one Root, their vital Sap derive, They crown their Mother with one tow'ring Head; And, like the Root that bids Them bloom and thrive, Such was their Mother! At one happy Birth, Three Sons producing, Three, the noblest Sons of Earth! CL. Of secret Things their Mother had the Skill, Knew Nature's Laws; A Nymph of Fairy Kind! Hence by her Art cou'd model to her Will, And to her Use each living Creature bind. There-to, She was right Fair to Mortal Eye, List She, to Mortal Eye, to show how Fair! Tempting to touch, and charming to descry; Her Stature, goodly; delicate, her Air. But She, as wont the Nymphs of Sylvan Race, In Forests spent her Days, and lov'd in Wilds to chase. CLI. There, on a Day, a noble youthly Knight, Adventures seeking in the savage Wood, By great good Fortune got of Her the Sight, As She sat careless by a Crystal Flood. And on Her, unawares, He lay'd his Hand, Combing her Locks, her Head to new-array; In vain She strove his Ardor to withstand, The too intemp'rate Youth wou'd have his Way. Oppressing Her by Force (as Bards have told) Three lovely Sons He got, that prov'd three Champions bold! CLII. These, long She foster'd in the lonely Wood, Till to the Ripeness of Man's State They grew, Then showing forth Signs of their Father's Blood; Arms first They love, Adventures then pursue. Adventures, where They knew to seek, They sought, Which, for their Safety, pain'd their Mother's Mind; For tho' their Pow'rs They prov'd, and Wonders wrought, Yet He that seeks Mischance, Mischance may find. For He that Danger rather courts than shuns, The greater is his Heart, the greater Hazard runs. CLIII. For This, She wish'd, the Number of their Days To know, and to inlarge with long Extent; By wond'rous Skill, thro' subterraneous Ways, Down to the Mansion of the Fates she went. Down to the Bottom of the deep Abyss, Far under Ground She went to Realms of Night, Where Demogorgon sits in gloomy Bliss, Far from the Eye of Heav'n, or View of Light, And rules the hideous Chaos; There she hies, The Fates to try; where hid, their dreadful Dwelling lies. CLIV. She found Them there, all seated in a Round, Full in the Midst the direful Distaff stands; Where drawing out the Lines of Life, She found The Fatal Sisters, with unweary'd Hands. Sad Clotho held the Rock; the vital Twine With Pain by griesly Lachesis was spun; But ah! how soon was all their fair Design, How soon! by cruel Atropos undone! With Steel accurst She cut the Twist in twain: Most wretched Man, whose Days depend on Threads so vain! CLV. Ent'ring She bow'd, and bending sate to Rest; Their Labor, then, survey'd with anxious Grace: And comprehending soon, the Fates address'd, Trembling in Heart, and looking pale in Face. To tell her Cause of Coming She began— To Whom, fierce Atropos; “Intruder bold! “That search the Secrets of the Life of Man! “That dare, from Mortal what is hid, behold! “Well worthy Thou to be of Jove accurst, “And shorten'd of their Twine, thy Sons in Secret nurst.” CLVI. Where-at She, sore afraid, the Fates besought Pardon to grant, and Rigor to abate, And pray'd to see how strong their Twine was wrought, And know the utmost Measure of their Date. This Clotho grants; so Destiny ordain'd! And gives Her to inspect the fated Line; The Mother to the Soul was inly pain'd, Nor cou'd forbear to murmur and repine; Spun were their Threads, She thought, as Spiders spin, As thin as Webs They seem'd, and yet as short as thin. CLVII. For longer Measure, and for stronger Thread, She strait began the Sisters to ingage; That so their Lives might be prolong'd (She said) But Lachesis as soon began to rage. “Deem You alike, fond Dame (the Goddess cry'd,) “Alike! of Human Things, and Things Divine? “That alter'd they may be? (oh mortal Pride!) “And chang'd, at Pleasure, for those Sons of Thine? “Not so; for, what the Destinies decree, Not all the Gods can force, not Jove himself can free. CLVIII. ‘If then the Term of Life, (the Nymph rejoin'd) ‘Can neither be, or lessen'd, or enlarg'd; Grant This (this Grant will ease a Mother's Mind) ‘With Either's Soul be Either's Body charg'd. ‘So when You doom the Eldest of the Three, ‘(Whose Life, I see, is shortest) pass his Soul; ‘Transfer it to the Second in Degree: ‘And let the Third and Last possess the Whole. ‘Thus Each, in Other, shall his Life prolong, ‘In Life of Other, Each shall thus be trebly strong. CLIX. The careful Sisters granted her Request; With full-contented Mind the Nymph departs. Return'd, She meets Her Sons in Armor drest, Not to her Wish, nor knew They of her Arts. From Them conceal'd She what the Fates design'd, And how their Lives were lengthen'd, fear'd to tell; Yet oft as fair Occasion She cou'd find, She bids Son trust to Son, whate'er befell. “Let Brother on his Brother's Safety wait, “Give Love for Love, my Boys, whate'er your future Fate. CLX. And firm in Friendship liv'd They all their Days, Rash Discord never ent'ring either Mind! Which added much to all their other Praise, And now in Love of Canace They join'd. As by Affection natural 'twas agreed, Each cou'd not but approve what Each approv'd; And tho' same Likings sure Aversions breed; Here lov'd They more, because alike They lov'd. Hence the dire Conflict grew including All, (As oft) great Matter growing from Beginning small. CLXI. O! why do wretched Men so much desire To draw their Days to the remotest Date? Why do not rather wish Them to expire, Knowing the certain Mis'ry of their State? Tost like the Vessel on the surging Wave, What Ills await Them, threat'ning to devour! One Danger, from the Cradle to the Grave, Attends; for Death attends Them ev'ry Hour! And Who most happy seems, and least complains, Is yet, as near his End, as He that suffers Pains! CLXII. For This, I hold the Nymph more fond, than sage, Her Children's Life thus seeking to prolong; To lengthen Mis'ry, She wou'd lengthen Age: But She that means the Right, can act no Wrong. And happy, Each in Other, breath'd the Three, Of Other Each, approving, and approv'd; So courteous Each with Other to agree, It made Them more esteem'd of Friends They lov'd; And Each with Other so for Valor priz'd, It made Them dreaded more of Foes whom They despis'd. CLXIII. These Three that hardy Challenge took in Hand, With great Camballo to maintain the Fight; The Day was set, that All might understand, And Pledges pawn'd, as claim'd the Martial Rite. That Day (and ne'er was Day, of equal Dread, Known, or to Those, before, or Those, since Born!) Soon as the Face of Heav'n was streak'd with Red, These warlike Champions hail the rising Morn; And, glorious as the Sun, in Armor shine, Assembling in the Field, the Challenge to define. CLXIV. The Field with Lists was all around inclos'd, To bar the Press of People far away; And at one Side six Judges were dispos'd, To view and deem the Deeds of Arms that Day. Fresh in Array, and beautiful to Sight, Fair Canace adorn'd a stately Stage, Rais'd opposite; the Fortune of the Fight Engag'd to see: Her Beauty was the Gage! There to be seen, as his most worthy Wife Who purchas'd her full fair, at Venture of his Life. CLXV. Camballo enter'd first the Listed Space, With stately Step, that scorn'd the Pow'r of Chance; As sure of Conquest, fearless was his Face: As fearless, tho' less sure, the Three advance. Their 'Scutcheons, richly gilt; and, streaming high, Their Banners, that on Day reflected Day. Thrice marching round the List, They charm'd the Eye, Such was their manly Port, and brave Array. Thrice bow'd They lowly to the noble Maid, The while the Trumpets shrill, and loud the Clarions play'd. CLXVI. Advanc'd the Challenger with hardy Stride, All arm'd to Point, his Challenge to maintain; Him Priamondo met with equal Pride, To Point all arm'd, to take it in Disdain. A Trumpet blew. Strait closing, Hand to Hand, With furious Force and fell Intent They met, Careless of Peril in the furious Stand; Life they expos'd, as Life had been a Debt: A Debt so deeply 'gag'd, that They esteem'd Twas Folly now to spare, what cou'd not be redeem'd. CLXVII. Well practis'd Priamondo was in Fight, And great his Skill in Use of Spear and Shield. Nor less approv'd Camballo's Martial Might, Nor less his Skill or Shield or Spear to wield. 'Twas hard to guess which was the hardier Foe; For equal ev'ry Blow on either Side, And either Side sent Death at ev'ry Blow. It seem'd, that Chance, not Merit, must decide. Each eyes the Other with such watchful Care, That short falls ev'ry Blow, or vainly glides in Air. CLXVIII. Yet One of Many with unlucky Glance, (Of Many One by Priamondo sent) Took Place, directed less by Aim than Chance, And passing thro' Camballo's Shoulder went. It went; his Shield it forc'd him to forego. Much was He griev'd, and rag'd with high Disdain; Yet from the Wound no Blood He felt to flow, But wond'rous Pain; his Courage rose with Pain; That urg'd his haughty Soul to Vengance fell. Smart daunts not mighty Hearts, but makes them more to swell. CLXIX. With That, He bade his poignant Jav'lin fly Full at his Foe, and close beneath his Shield; It enter'd thro' his Mail, and pierc'd his Thigh, The Blood gush'd forth and stain'd the grassy Field. With double Force it flew, and reach'd the Knight; Much was the Knight incumber'd with the Wound; To stand unable, or erect his Hight, For, here and there, He reel'd along the Ground. So as the sapless Oak, thro' Age declin'd, Submits to ev'ry Blast, and bends to ev'ry Wind. CLXX. Soon as Camballo his Condition spy'd, Full at the Spear He caught with all his Might, Meaning to draw, or thrust from Side to Side, And so at one Attempt conclude the Fight. Deep was the Point infix'd, and hard He drew; Hard tho' He drew, still back the Foe reclin'd: Freed from the Weapon on the Knight He flew, (Broke was the Staff, the Head was left behind.) At which the Hero, more inrag'd than tam'd, Re-charging him afresh, thus scornfully exclaim'd. CLXXI. “Here, take the Meed of thy Mischallenge, take! “Thus long have I permitted Thee to live; “Not for thine own, but for thy Sister's Sake: “A Debt I might forbear, but not forgive.” The wicked Weapon heard the wrathful Vow, And pass'd to second his vindictive Ire, His Beaver pierc'd, and shiver'd on his Brow, That with the Force it forc'd him to retire, Then broke; Half, quiv'ring in his Head-piece stood, And Half the Owner held, and curs'd the treach'rous Wood. CLXXII. The sudden Shock with Rage Camballo bore; And, where it stuck, from forth his Beaver drew The shorten'd Spear, that pain'd Him as he tore: He drew, and back at Priamondo threw. The faithless Weapon found a ready Way To pierce his Gorget where his Neck was bare; Where lies the Pipe, commission'd to convey, Fresh to the lab'ring Breast, the vital Air. Thence Streams of purple Blood, the Last of Life, Dismiss his weary Soul, and end the doubtful Strife. CLXXIII. His weary Soul, from earthly Bondage freed, Nor fled to Heav'n, where Some say Spirits fly; Nor vanish'd into Air, as Others plead; Nor chang'd into a Star adorn'd the Sky; Nor sought direct (a solitary Shade!) In Pluto's gloomy Realm, Eternal Rest: But thro' Traduction, (as his Mother pray'd) Pass'd instantaneous to his Brother's Breast. His Brother, next in Order, that surviv'd, In Whom He liv'd anew, of former Life depriv'd. CLXXIV. He, when He spy'd Him breathless on the Field, Was touch'd with Sorrow for his Brother's Fate; Way to his Sorrow yet He scorn'd to yield, But rather rous'd to Vengeance and to Hate. Nor this the Time to wail, or to condole;— But fierce He rushes to renew the Fight; Thro' secret Impulse of his gen'rous Soul, As in Reversion of his Brother's Right. And, challenging the Virgin as his Due; The Foe was soon addrest: the Trumpets freshly blew. CLXXV. With That, together Both so fiercely clos'd, As Limb from Limb, Each, Other meant to rend; Foot fix'd to Foot, and Hand to Hand oppos'd, Nor Plate nor Mail the hideous Show'r defend. So deadlily They dealt their Axes round, Riv'd was the Plate, and shatter'd was the Mail; Pain felt the One, the Other dy'd the Ground, Fire flash'd from ev'ry Blow, Trail after Trail; As fast as Light'ning after Thunder flies: That fill'd the crouded List with Terror and Surprize. CLXXVI. As when two Tigers prick'd with hungry Rage, Chance in the Chace to meet the wish'd-for Spoil, On which they hope their Famine to asswage, And gain a feastful Harvest of their Toil. To make the just Partition Both refuse, And Both contest the Fortune of the Day; Hence strife-full Broil, and cruel Fight insues, While Neither lets the Other touch the Prey; And Either scorns with Other to partake: So, strove these warlike Knights, for this fair Lady's Sake. CLXXVII. Full many a Blow, and mortally design'd, Was interchang'd; yet short fell ev'ry Blow! For They were all so warded or declin'd, That Life in Each stood fearless of her Foe. Till Diamondo, scorning long Delay Of wav'ring Fortune, fix'd to neither Side; Resolv'd to end the Doubt at one Essay, And at one Aim the Battle to decide; “Take This for Priamondo!” (fierce He spoke) And heav'd his murd'rous Axe, and gave a vengeful Stroke. CLXXVIII. The vengeful Stroke had finish'd soon the Strife, Sped, as was meant, so deadly was it meant! Soon had it from the Body forc'd the Life; But This Camballo's better Fates prevent. He mark'd him as He rais'd and lowr'd his Hand, And judg'd the Blow would fall with mighty Sway, So swerv'd, as it arriv'd, and slip'd his Stand, And sudden to it's fell Intent gave way. Missing the Mark, to which his Eye was bound, Nigh fell'd Him his right Arm, his right Foot plow'd the Ground. CLXXIX. As when a Vulture, greedy of his Prey, By Hunger prest, and Hunger Heart can lend! Strikes at a Heron, in th' etherial Way, On whom his feather'd Forces downward bend; Nought seems that can defend Her from her Foe: Herself the Fowl defends with wary Care; She spies Him, as He stoops, eludes the Blow, And makes Him spend his Wings in empty Air. That with his proper Weight, deceiv'd in Sight, Nigh to the Ground He falls, and scarce recovers Flight. CLXXX. The fair Occasion, when Camballo spy'd, Full at the Knight He drove with all his Pow'r; E'er, for Assault or Ward He could provide: And smote Him with his Axe, in luckless Hour With dire Dexterity the Stroke was sped, Then as recover'd, from his Stoop, the Foe; And from his Shoulders off it bore his Head: The headless Trunk stood heedless of the Blow! A while it stood, as still respiring Breath, Till feeling Life to fail, it fell; and slept in Death. CLXXXI. Amaz'd were the Spectators of the Field, So long erect an headless Trunk to see; With Arms, that void of Life, vain Weapons wield, Unknowing of the Fates divine Decree! For tho' one Soul from out his Body fled, 'Twas that which from his Brother He deriv'd; And, but that thus dismember'd of the Head, His Body would have liv'd, and had reviv'd. Where, as his Soul no fitting Mansion found, The Lifeless Corse is left to fall and spread the Ground. CLXXXII. Yet left not either Soul the doubtful Strife, Nor yet retir'd to Seat of Heav'nly Rest; But fill'd with double Grief and double Life, Their last lov'd Mansion, Triamondo's Breast! Inly He felt a more than Mortal Smart, And strait He leap'd into the empty Field, With more than common Strength, or common Heart; And menac'd with his Spear, and shook his Shield. Thus brave Camballo bravely He address'd, Who fac'd the Foe, and soon the Fight was closely prest. CLXXXIII. Well might You wonder how that noble Knight, Was able to sustain Wound after Wound; And what impower'd him to renew the Fight, And how on Foot He cou'd maintain his Ground. Yet had You then Him forth advancing seen, As fierce He seem'd, as fresh the Field to take, As had He been new-form'd, new-soul'd had been; The Semblance of the new-recuited Snake, That, soon as Spring dispels the Wintry Cold, Throws off his ragged Skin, and shines in Scales of Gold. CLXXXIV. 'Twas all thro' Virtue of the Ring He wore, Whence wounded not a single Drop He bled; His weakened Strength her working Pow'rs restore, The Stone, therein incas'd, such Influence shed. Else how cou'd One of equal Might with Most, With Most of equal Might, yet still but One! Before so Many no less Mighty boast; And go the Road to Honor He had gone? Or think to match Three such in equal Fight? Three such! as match'd an Host! an Host in either Knight! CLXXXV. Yet This in Triamondo rais'd no Dread, Nor yet of glorious Vict'ry He despair'd; But closing Him, well arm'd from Foot to Head, What Man cou'd do, He did; cou'd dare, He dar'd. Thick pour'd his Blows, as Hail-stones from the Sky, On ev'ry Side He struck, hew'd, urg'd, and press'd; All doubt or cou'd He stand, or wou'd He fly: So fast the Foe his Iron Axe address'd, That Sparks of Fire from ev'ry Stroke insue; As fast, as from the Rock, the Sprays of Briny Dew. CLXXXVI. Much was Camballo daunted with the Blows, So thick They fell, so forcibly were sent, Constrain'd (to such a Hight his Fury rose) Back to retire, and some-what to relent. Safer, He judg'd, to ward than to withstand, The Rage of Passion, rising in its Course; He waits his shorter Breath, and lighter Hand, Then fresh assails Him with superior Force: That caus'd the Foe, abated of his Heat, Fast, forward as He press'd, now backward to retreat. CLXXXVII. As when the Tide, from Ocean newly sped, Flows up the Shenan with contrary Course; O'er-rules the Stream, in his own Watry Bed, And makes Him seem to have an adverse Sourse: Back towards his Spring the Current re-ascends, And Borders, lately pass'd, again surveys; But when again the Flood its Vigor spends, Then back his borrow'd Waters He repays. And sends the Sea his own with double Gain, And Tribute, with his own, as Sov'reign of the Main. CLXXXVIII. Various as these, the Tides of Battle flow, With diverse Fortune doubtful to be deem'd; Now This the Better had, now had his Foe; Then One half vanquish'd, then the Other seem'd Yet Victor Each Himself in Valor thought, And held his Rival dying, if not dead; Felt, many a Pang, Camballo, while They fought, And Blood abundant Triamondo shed. That with the Wasting of his Vital Flood, Faintly He breath'd at Heart, on Foot He feebly stood. CLXXXIX. Camballo stronger still, and greater grew, Nor felt his Blood to waste, nor Pow'rs to fail; From Wound new made He gather'd Vigor new, So much the Virtues of the Ring prevail. Like as the Tree, by Blights or Years, Tho', wither'd, to the Trunk it droops the Head, Reviv'd, when prun'd with careful Skill, appears, And joys again to flourish and to spread; New Fruit producing, from the Husband's Toil, As fresh as when it first was planted in the Soil. CXC. Thro' like Advantage in his Strength He rose, And smote with wond'rous Force the adverse Knight; There, where the Seams the jointed Hauberk close, That down He fell, as dead to Human Sight. Dead yet He was not! Yet He suffer'd Death! Death sure as suffers Ought of Mortal State! Felt the last Struggle of expiring Breath! And pay'd a Life at the Demand of Fate! For strait One Soul from out his Body flies, From human Mis'ry freed, and seeks its native Skies. CXCI. Meantime, while All that spy'd Him deem'd Him Dead, For visible to All He seem'd to die! As rising from a Dream He rear'd his Head, And sudden on his Foe began to fly. At so uncouth a Sight the Foe amaz'd, Lost Pow'r of Speech, not Utt'rance cou'd afford; Unmov'd, as had He seen a Ghost, He gaz'd, And slow of Action held his idle Sword. Till struck full oft by his impetuous Arm, To strike He was constrain'd, to save Himself from Harm. CXCII. Yet from that Hour more warily He fought, In Fear the Stygian Gods to un-befriend; As One, to save Himself, that rather sought, Than fast persue'd Another to offend; Nor Life, nor Labor chose to spend in vain. When Triamondo found his cooler Play, He judg'd it follow'd, or from Fear or Pain, Ill able to support the closing Fray; Or that the Knight cou'd ill on Foot indure, A Sign that must to Him the Vict'ry soon assure. CXCIII. Joy'd to the Soul, on high He rais'd his Hand, In Mind to give the last decisive Blow; The Foe to end, or fear'd He to withstand, Or dar'd He to withstand, to end the Foe. Camballo mark'd Him, not inclin'd to yield, And nothing slow to save his threaten'd Head; His Sword He drew, and pass'd his op'ning Shield, Slight was the Op'ning, Slight the Pass was sped: He struck Him, as to strike his Hand He rear'd; Beneath his Arm it went, and at his Back appear'd. CXCIV. Yet Triamondo's Axe pursued its Way, And fell full heavy on Camballo's Crest. The Hero in a swooning Absence lay; An hideous Wound was on his Head imprest. His Shield with Brims of Brass was plated round, And there it found a Rest, nor farther sped; Else had the Knight been cleav'd, and spred the Ground, Down to the Breast dissever'd from the Head. So Both at once fell breathless on the Field, And Each to Other seem'd the Vict'ry there to yield. CXCV. The Croud conclude The Fight was at an End! The Marshals of the Field, and Judges rose! Wail'd Canace her Brother as her Friend! They rend the Trophies, and the Lists They close! Nought rested but to speak their Fun'ral Praise! Ascertain'd now, by Death, the Doubtful Strife! When Lo! at once their Living Forms They raise, One, from his Ring; One, from his Treble Life; And Both together rising (wond'rous Sight!) Fresh, Other Each assail'd, and fierce renew'd the Fight. CXCVI. Each claiming then the Other as his Prize, Begun, as had the Fight but then begun; Alike, Strokes, Wounds, Shields, Weapons They despise, And Danger rather try to find than shun. Death fear'd They not, nor yet for Life They car'd, Life to let out, alike, or Death let in. For Death They valu'd not, nor Life They spar'd, Or Who was to be won, or Who to win. More to be kill'd desirous, than to kill; To Both Life seem'd a Load, and Safety seem'd an Ill. CXCVII. While thus the Battle hung, a doubtful Scale! Unsure to Whom the Balance wou'd decline, Sad ev'ry Heart, and ev'ry Face grew pale The Close of All unwilling to divine; All suddenly a clamorous Noise They heard; That seem'd some perilous Tumult to portend; As Something strange at near Approach appear'd, And caus'd the Croud the Vault of Heav'n to rend. With Cries of Women, and Alarms of Boys, Such as the troubled Theatre full oft annoyes. CXCVII. Each Champion heard the Clamor from afar, But what it brought not sudden cou'd devise; When lo! They spy'd, fair seated on a Car, A Maid that cou'd not fail to touch their Eyes. Fast as a Whirlwind drives, She drives along, And lovely was the Virgin to behold! Yet faster Way She made amidst the Throng, For that her Car was all adorn'd with Gold, It seem'd as for some Persian Monarch plan'd, With various Gems inrich'd, and show'd a master Hand. CXCIX. Drawn was her Car (What wond'rous is to tell) By two grim Lyons, subject to Command; And tho' They look'd in Fierceness to excell Their savage Kind, yet tame They bore her Hand. Erect on Foot, high rais'd, the Damsel stood, And more than Human seem'd to Human Sight. Bright as the Dame that bore Her in the Wood, She shone (and Either shone as Angel bright) But, with her Beauty, Bounty might compare, Which of the Two in Her might claim the greater Share. CC. The Fair was Daughter to th' enamour'd Knight, Who once again oppress'd the Sylvan Maid; Long had He watch'd to gain the pleasing Sight, Till unawares He caught Her in the Shade. In Magick Lore the Mother deeply skill'd, Her Child in all her subtle Arts improv'd; And now She came with kind Affection fill'd, To aid her Brother, whom She dearly lov'd. In Haste She came to pacify the Strife, For Bad the Loss or Gain, where Gain or Loss is Life. CCI. Her, as the Croud press'd nearer to behold, Less tractable her ireful Leaders grew; Numbers They drove before, as Sheep to Fold, And Numbers, roll'd in Dust, for Haste o'erthrew; That in the mix'd Confusion of the Throng, For Fear of Danger, Some to Distance fly! For Curiosity, Some rac'd along! Some for Themselves, and Some for Others cry! Some laugh for Fancy, Some for Wonder shout! And Some, that wou'd seem Wise, their Wonder turn to Doubt! CCII. In her Right Hand a Rod of Peace She bore, Around, two Serpents mutually were wound; Bound firmly by the Tail in Lovely Lore, And Both were with one Olive Garland crown'd. Like to the Wand that wields the Son of May, Seals He in Sleep the Eye, or opes in Light; Draws He from Hell the Shade, or drives away The Soul from Earth; Day ministring or Night. And in her other Hand She held a Vase, With choice Nepenthe sill'd; a Juice of sov'reign Grace! CCIII. Nepenthe! Drink prepar'd by Heav'nly Art! By Gods devis'd, all Sorrow to asswage! To chace the Grief of Soul, and Gall of Heart, Whence spring sore Anguish, and contentious Rage! To Age, it gives sweet Peace and quiet Rest! Firm Friendship and unalter'd Love, to Youth! The Mind establishes, and chears the Breast! Reserv'd for Such as Wisdom court and Truth! Few by the Gods to taste it are assign'd! But All, assign'd to taste it, Bliss Eternal find! CCIV. Such Men of Worth, deriv'd of Mortal Birth, As mighty Jove advances to the Sky; Gods for their Merit made from Sons of Earth! Partake of This, e'er yet to Heav'n They fly. Secure of Joys, that will for ever last, All Mem'ry here They drown of Human Care; All Hope, or Fear, of Future, or of Past, Then, unremembring, to the Blest repair. Heroes of old of This were giv'n to taste, E'er yet among the Gods Immortal They were plac'd. CCV. Much more of Price, and of more gracious Pow'r, This than the Fountain in Ardenna found; Of which Renaldo drank in happy Hour, As sings the Tuscan To save the Inquisitive the Trouble of searching after Spenser's Allusion, it was thought not unnecessary to give Him here an Opportunity of satisfying his Curiosity by subjoining as much of the Love and Hate of Renaldo for Angelica as made to the Purpose. And This rather from Harrington's Translation (which is yet very intelligible, tho' dedicated to Queen Elizabeth) than from Ariosto, who might not be so well understood by every Reader. Ariost.Book I. 1 Of Dames, of Knights, of Arms, of Love's Delight, Of Courtesies, of high Attempts I speake, Then when the Moores transported all their Might On Africke Seas the Force of France to breake: Incited by the youthfull Heat and Spight Of Agramant their King, that vow'd to wreake The Death of King Trayans (lately slaine) Upon the Roman Emperour Charlemaine. 5 Orlando, who long time had loved deare, Angelica the Faire; and for her Sake, About the World, in Nations far and neare, Did high Attempts performe and undertake, Return'd with her into the West that Yeare, That Charles his Power against the Turks did make: And with the Force of Germanie and France, Neare Pyren Alpes his Standard did advance. 8 Betweene Orlando and Renaldo late, There fell about Angelica some Brall, And each of them began the tother Hate, This Ladies Love had made them both so thrall. But Charles, who much mislikes that such Debate Between such Friends should rise, on Cause so small, To Namus of Baveir in Keeping gave her, And suffred neither of them both to have her. 9 But promist he would presently bestow The Damsel faire, on him that in that Fight The plainest Proofe should of his Prowesse show, And danger most the Pagans with his Might; But (ay the while) the Christians take the Blow, Their Soldiers slaine, their Captains put to Fight, The Duke himselfe a Prisner there was taken, His Tent was quite abandon'd and forsaken. 10 Where when the Damsel faire a while had stay'd, That for the Victor pointed was a Pray, She tooke her Horse, ne farther time delay'd, But secretly convay'd herself away; For she foresaw, and was full sore afray'd, That this to Charles would prove a dismal Day. And riding through a Wood, she hapt to meet A Knight that came against her on his Feet. 11 His Cuiras on; his Helmet not undone, His Sword and Target ready to the same, And through the Wood so swiftly he did runne, As they that go half naked for a Game. But never did a Shepheard's Daughter shunne More speedily a Snake that on her came, Then faire Angelica did take her Flight, When as she once had Knowledge of the Knight. 12 This valiant Knight was Lord of Clarimount, Duke Ammon's Sonne, as you shall understand, Who having lost his Horse of good Account, That by Mishap was slipt out of his Hand; He follow'd him, in Hope againe to mount, Untill this Ladies Sight did make him stand, Whose Face and Shape proportion'd were so well, They seem'd the House where Love itselfe did dwell. 13 But She that shuns Renaldo all She may, Upon her Horse's Necke doth lay the Raine, Through thicke and thin She gallopeth away, Ne makes She Choise of beaten Way or Plaine, But gives her Palfrey leave to cause the Way, And being mov'd with Feare and with Disdaine, Now up, now downe, She never leaves to ride, Till She arrived by a River-side. 77 And being newly setled in Her Seate, She saw a Man on Foote all armed runne, Streight in her Mind She gan to chafe and fret, Because She knew it was Duke Ammon's Sonne, Most earnestly He sude Her Love to get, More earnestly She seeks his Love to shunne. Once She lov'd Him, He hated Her as much; And now He loves, She hates, his Hap was such. 78 The Cause of this first from two Fountaines grew, Like in the Tast, but in Effects unlike, Plac'd in Ardenna, each in other's View, Who tasts the one, Love's Dart his Heart doth strike; Contrary of the other doth ensew, Who drinke thereof their Lovers shall mislike. Renaldo dranke of one, and Love him pained: Shee drunke the other, and his Love disdained. Book II. 1 O blind God, Love, why tak'st thou such Delight, With Darts of divers Force our Hearts to wound? By thy too much abusing of thy Might, This Discord great in humane Hearts is found. When I would wade the shallow Foord aright, Thou draw'st me to the Deepe to have me dround, From those love me, my Love thou dost recall, And place it where I find no Love at all. 2 Thou mak'st most faire unto Renaldo seeme Angelica, that takes him for a Foe; And when that She of him did well esteeme, Then He dislikt, and did refuse Her thoe. Which makes Her now of Him the lesse to deeme. Thus as (they say) She renders quit pro quo. She hateth Him, and doth detest Him so, She first will die, ere She will with him go. 22 He follow'd Her through Valley, Hill, and Plaine, Through Woods and Thickets for his Master's sake, Whom he permitted not to touch the Raine, For feare lest He some other Way should take, By which Renaldo though with mickle Paine Twise found Her out, twise She did Him forsake: For first Ferraw, then Sacrapant withstood, That by twise finding Her He did no good. Book XLII. 44 Ere long into Ardenna Woods he enters, Soone after he Basylea quite had past: Ardenna Woods, whence many come Repenters, And in that Forrest have bene sore agast, To travell through the same Renaldo venters, When suddenly the Skie did overcast, And there arose a blacke and hideous Storme, And then appear'd a Monster of strange Forme. 45 She seem'd of Woman's Shape, but in her Hed A thousand Eyes She had, that Watch did keepe; As many Eares, with which She harkened; Her Eyes want Lids, and therefore never sleepe; In steed of Haire, Her Crowne Snakes overspred; Thus marched She forth of the Darknesse deepe. Her Tayle one Serpent bigger than the rest, Which She with Knots had tyde about her Brest. 46 This Sight, Renaldos Mind appald so sore, He feeles his Heart alreadie gan to fayle him, And sith it never had done so before, He marvels what (the good yeare) now should aile him: Yet still his Minde misgave him more and more, To see the Monster coming to assaile Him, He nathlesse countersets his wonted Boldnesse, Though quaking Hands bewraid his inward Coldnesse. 51 When lo! a Knight unto his Succour went, All armd in shining Steele, and on his Shield He bare a Yoke in sundry Peeces rent, And Flames of Fire all in a yellow Field, So weaponed he was, as if He ment To make all that encountred Him to yeeld. A Sword and Speare He had, and to the same A Mace, from whence he threw continual Flame. 55 But when Renaldo was from Danger free, And that same Knight by whom his Safetie came, So courteously to come to Him did see, His Speech to Him in kind Words he did frame, And gave Him many Thanks in hye Degree, And then besought him He might know his Name, That th' Emperor and all his Court might know, What Knight did so great Grace on him bestow. 56 The Knight in courteous Manner thus replide: I would not you should take it in Displeasure, That I my Name from you a while shall hide, But e're the Shadow grow a Yard by Measure, I shall you tell. Thus onward still they ride, Renaldo being pleas'd to stay his Leasure. So long they went together, till they found A christal Spring, that ran along the Ground. 57 At which full oft the Herdmen, that did dwell Near those same Woods, have in their loving Fits Drunke Love away, with tasting of that Well, And of those Passions purged cleane their Wits: Now (for the Knight that rode with him could tell That for Renaldo's Ill this Phisicke fits) He doth advise him there to stay a space, And make that Well their Baite and Resting-place. 58 Renaldo of the Motion well allowth, And lighteth strait, and to the Well doth go, Both for that Heat and Travell bred his Drowth, And that the Monster had disturbd Him so; Unto the christal Well He puts his Mouth, And greedily drinks downe five Gulps or mo, And from his Brest doth with one Draught remove, His burning Thirst, and his more burning Love. 59 Now when that other Knight that with Him went, Saw him lift up himselfe from that same Brooke, And found He did his foolish Love repent, And that He now that Humor quite forsooke, Then to declare his Name He was content, And looking with a grave and loftie Looke, He said, Renaldo, know I hight Disdaine, That came to loose Thee from Loves foolish Chaine. 60 This said, He vanisht from Renaldo quite, &amp;c. Poet, far renown'd. For had That Pow'r to change the Bent of Mind, From Love to Hate, a Change of evil Choice! But This reverse, from Hate to Love inclin'd, Who wou'd not to this Virtue yield his Voice? Hate is of Brutes, and What the Gods detest; But Love the Gift of Heav'n, and glads the Human Breast. CCVI. Now close beside the List her Leaders stand, (And strong-inclosing Bars the List surround!) She strikes the Bars, that open to her Hand, Then enter'd, quits her Car, and takes the Ground. “Friendship and Peace to All!” (The Virgin cry'd;) “Friendship and Peace! The greatest Good in Life!” First to Her Brother was the Wish apply'd, Whom, sorely griev'd, She found in Bloody Strife; Last, to the Foe, whose warlike Air and Grace, Then secret, touch'd her Soul, and dy'd her conscious Face. CCVII. Both slightly bow'd; (for small was their Delight, As then, to entertain the Lovely Maid) Then turn'd Them to the Battle: At the Sight, Between them, on the Field, Herself She laid. With double Hopes disturb'd, and double Fears, Nought that cou'd move the Reconciler spares, With Sighs now intermixing soft'ning Tears, And pow'rful Reasons adding now to Pray'rs. For cordial Peace, from horrid War, She sought, By All, They held most dear! By Her, for whom They fought! CCVIII. But when She found, She cou'd not so prevail, She touch Them lightly with her pow'rful Wand; Then sudden as the Hearts of Cowards fail, Down fall their wrathful Swords, and motionless They stand; They stand, as Men possest with Panick Fright, Struck, with They know not What of dread Surprize; Thus e'er their scatter'd Pow'rs They cou'd unite, Or free their mighty Souls from mightier Ties; Her Golden Bowl, with sweet Oblivion fraught, She reach'd; and, glad for Thirst, Each drank an hearty Draught! CCIX. Soon as They tasted once the Juice Divine, Wonder it was the sudden Change to see, From deadly Stroke in kind Embrace They join, And Hands They plight, no more to disagree; In Amity, such Enmity to close, And Foe, with Foe, as Friend with Friend to yield, And Faithful Friends to rise from Mortal Foes, This Turn of Things amaz'd the crouded Field; The crouded Field with Joy and Wonder rise, One loud Applause ensues, re-echoing thro' the Skies! CCX. When gentle Canace This sees and hears, In Haste She from her lofty Seat descends; And soon amidst the Combatants appears, To know if so the cruel Conflict ends: When certain found; all due Respect She pay'd, In Manner easy, and in Speech polite; And, for her Conduct, praising much the Maid, At Sarra begs Her to dispose the Night; And add this other Favor to the rest, The Friendship to accept, that firmly She profest. CCXI. Agreed with true Sincerity of Heart; The Trumpets sounded, and the Judges rose; With Glee and gladsome Cheer the Croud depart: To march together Both the Champions chose. And Both together chose the Maids to ride; Cambina, Prudent Umpire of the Day; With sweet Affection taking to her Side Fair Canace, as fresh as Rose in May. Thence to Cambuscan's Palace They retir'd, By All applauded Each, and Each by All admir'd. CCXII. In perfect Love there many a Day They spend; Camballo with Cambina led his Life; And who, but Triamondo, cou'd pretend A rightful Claim to Canace as Wife? I pass the joyous Feasts, the solemn Rites, Things well to be conceiv'd, tho' not exprest; The Days of Dalliance, and of Bliss the Nights; Suffice, that Each in Each was fully Blest. So join'd by Love, and so by Friendship bound, That never since their Days, were Four so Happy found. CCXIII. It rises oft in Life (as here it rose) That mortal Foes to faithful Friends may turn; And so may faithful Friends to mortal Foes: As Reasons temper, or as Passions burn. For oft some dire Mistake misleads the Will, As well in Hate of Foes, as Love of Friends; Hence Enmity, that not proceeds of Ill, But of Occasion, with th' Occasion ends; And Friendship, which a faint Affection breeds Without Regard of Good, dies like ill-grounded Seeds. CCIV. Meantime the Sun his due Meridian Hight Had gain'd, when Neither lost, yet Either won; While great Cambuscan, who declin'd the Sight, Resign'd to Fate the Daughter, and the Son. The Monarch thought, Fate order'd for the Best. But hold—'tis Time to check the forward Steed!— Nor shou'd our Tale too long delay the Rest; What yet remains, in Order may succeed, When next our Turn; Intemperance of Tongue, Mine Host will well excuse, his Orator is young.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. PROLOGUE TO THE Merchant's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. Well clos'd! (The Merchant thus applauds the Squire) Your Tale is full of Fancy and of Fire. You show, (He adds) to say no more than Truth, A most surprizing Genius, for a Youth. To cloath each Image in it's proper Dress, And to design as well as to express, Inclines my sober Judgement to presage, You will not find your Match in riper Age. If but so long your Thread of Life be spun, And you persist to end as You begun; In Glory you must set (so Heav'n dispose Your Future Fate) in Splendor as You rose. Now by the Holy Trinity I swear, Blest, cou'd I die this Hour, in such an Heir. More Blest, than if this Hour I cou'd command Ten Thousand Marks a-year, in solid Land. Not that I want—some Fortune I have made— And all the World esteems me rich in Trade. But 'tis a Pain to live at large Expence, For One, that Spirit wants as well as Sense. Such is my Son! Whom, heartily I hate! What, is the Man, (quoth I) not what, is his Estate? It joy'd Me, when I turn'd Him Boy to School; It griev'd me sore, when He return'd a Fool. But Scholars flourish thro' a Lucky Sign; And rare to meet, as Layman or Divine! Well! Soldier He shall be. I bought Him Lace; The Rest He had, a Person, and a Face! And soon He learn'd the Military Art, And soon He lost his Post, for Want of Heart! This sham'd Me much, and robb'd Me of my Wife; Love of my Youth! And Comfort of my Life! I join'd Him then, my Commerce to attend; He join'd Me, but to dissipate, and spend. Now, that my Turn is Frugal, I admit; Yet I am something gen'rous, for a Cit. Plain as I go, or when I walk, or ride; The Lord, that owes Me Money, gives me Pride. And had I such a Son, as cou'd but write, As Authors wrote; as Soldiers fought, wou'd fight; Cit as I am, that Son I wou'd support.— But Mine, will drink with Footmen of the Court. With Knaves, at Dice, All I cou'd save, wou'd waste, Nor knows one Man of Sense, or Man of Taste. I doubt, not much is gain'd, (return'd our Host) By that same Sense, and Taste, tho' much is lost. But, Merchant, let me mind You of your Tale; My Bill is drawn on Sight! You will not fail? Not (quoth the Merchant) tho' You take Me hors'd, Suppose it but accepted and indors'd. The Squire will well excuse me what was said; I only wish'd my Son, so turn'd, and bred! In that (rejoin'd our Host) the Man is right; But Cits grow tedious, as they grow Polite: The Twine will break, too nicely that You spin. Begin! Enough of this! Enough! Begin!— The Merchant, then. Your Mandate I obey; Sir Host! I hold you Sov'reign for the Day. Gracious, receive, what humbly is addrest, So pleasing One, I hope to please the Rest. Yet grant Me, first to wail, if not atone, A greater Ill; a Folly of my own! For Store of Rancor, Malice, Spleen, and Spite, Have I, from ev'ry Morn, to ev'ry Night! No Peace at Table, and no Rest in Bed! The Case of most, so hardy, as to wed; For mine, I trow, is not a single Case: Ev'n here are More, that wear the Marry'd Face. Yet am I One of Those, supremely curst, Plague'd with a Wife, of wicked Wives, the Worst! Yok'd to the Fiend, the Foremost to rebel; My Help-mate wou'd out-devil, the Devil in Hell. To blame Her, here or there, wou'd be to wrong The Compass of her Temper, or her Tongue! Nor This, nor That, her special Vice I call; Her, First, or Last! She is a Shrew at All! Long is the Distance, and the Diff'rence wide, 'Twixt humble Grizild, and my haughty Bride! Unfetter'd once, so may I trade and thrive, As Nought shou'd teach my Heart again to wive. Cage'd, soon as caught in the Connubial Snare, We dance one Round of Slav'ry, and of Care. Who takes a Wife, will find it to his Cost; The Freedom, and the Ease of Life is lost. Try, he that will, the Matrimonial State, This, will He own a Truth, or soon, or late. By holy Thomas, the good Saint of Inde, Deceitful is the Sex; a slipp'ry Kind. This, of the greater Part, I mean to say; For One-and-All, wou'd be the Devil-to-pay! Here, shou'd You ask me, my right honest Host, How long since I was shipwreck'd on the Coast? With this my Second Choice what Time has past? (Peace to my First of Wives, for this my Last!) How long? You scarce will take it on my Word, Two Months are past, We enter on a Third. For slightly here to touch, not fully paint, This marry'd Fiend of an unmarry'd Saint, Who caught me with the Farce of Love she play'd, But singly priz'd me for my Stock in Trade; This Scold of Mine, keeps one Eternal Round, Sure, never Youth to Age in Wedlock bound, In Course of Years indur'd such Noise and Strife! Her Lesson of an Hour wou'd marr his Life! We will not doubt your Word, (our Host reply'd.) Yet some their Talents in a Napkin hide. Now you that are a Master of the Art, Conceal not all your Knowledge, but impart. Sir, (says the Merchant) 'tis the Thing I mean! The Thing You seek; a Matrimonial Scene! Not that my proper Farce I will disclose, But laugh, as Others laugh, at Other's Woes; None but the Fool his own Concern reveals; For Who feels Pain for what his Neighbour feels? End of the Prologue. January and May: OR, THE MERCHANT's TALE. By Mr. POPE. There liv'd in Lombardy, as Authors write, In Days of old, a wise and worthy Knight; Of gentle Manners, as of gen'rous Race, Bless'd with much Sense, more Riches, and some Grace. Yet, led astray by Venus' soft Delights, He scarce could rule some idle Appetites: For long ago, let Priests say what they cou'd, Weak, sinful Laymen were but Flesh and Blood. But in due time, when sixty Years were o'er, He vow'd to lead this vicious Life no more; Whether pure Holiness inspir'd his Mind, Or Dotage turn'd his Brain, is hard to find; But his high Courage prick'd him forth to wed, And try the Pleasures of a lawful Bed. This was his nightly Dream, his daily Care, And to the heav'nly Pow'rs his constant Pray'r, Once, e're he dy'd, to taste the blissful Life Of a kind Husband and a loving Wife. These Thoughts he fortify'd with Reasons still, (For none want Reasons to confirm their Will.) Grave Authors say, and witty Poets sing, That honest Wedlock is a glorious Thing: But Depth of Judgment most in him appears, Who wisely weds in his maturer Years. Then let him chuse a Damsel, young and fair, To bless his Age, and bring a worthy Heir; To sooth his Cares, and free from Noise and Strife, Conduct him gently to the Verge of Life. Let sinful Bachelors their Woes deplore, Full well they merit all they feel, and more: Unaw'd by Precepts, human or divine, Like Birds and Beasts promisc'ously they join: Nor know to make the present Blessing last, To hope the Future, or esteem the Past; But vainly boast the Joys they never try'd, And find divulg'd the Secrets they would hide. The marry'd Man may bear his Yoke with Ease, Secure at once himself and Heav'n to please; And pass his inoffensive Hours away In Bliss all Night, and Innocence all Day. Tho' Fortune change, his constant Spouse remains, Augments his Joys, or mitigates his Pains. But what so pure, which envious Tongues will spare? Some wicked Wits have libell'd all the Fair. With matchless Impudence they style a Wife, The dear-bought Curse, and lawful Plague of Life! A Bosom-Serpent, a domestic Evil! A Night-Invasion, and a Mid-Day Devil! Let not the Wise these sland'rous Words regard, But curse the Bones of ev'ry lying Bard. All other Goods by Fortune's Hand are giv'n, A Wife is the peculiar Gift of Heav'n: Vain Fortune's Favours, never at a Stay, Like empty Shadows, pass, and glide away; One solid Comfort, our eternal Wife, Abundantly supplies us all our Life: This Blessing lasts (if those who try, say true) As long as Heart can wish,—and longer too. Our Grandsire Adam, e're of Eve possess'd, Alone, and ev'n in Paradise unbless'd, With mournful Looks the blissful Scenes survey'd, And wander'd in the solitary Shade: The Maker saw, took pity, and bestow'd Woman, the last, the best Reserve of God. A Wife! Ah, gentle Deities, can he, That has a Wife e'er feel Adversity? Would Men but follow what the Sex advise, All things would prosper, all the World grow wise. 'Twas by Rebecca's Aid that Jacob won His Father's Blessing from an elder Son: Abusive Nabal ow'd his forfeit Life To the wise Conduct of a prudent Wife: Heroic Judith, as old Hebrews show, Preserv'd the Jews, and slew th' Assyrian Foe: At Hester's Suit the persecuting Sword Was sheath'd, and Isr'el liv'd to bless the Lord. These weighty Motives, January the sage Maturely ponder'd in his riper Age; And charm'd with virtuous Joys, and sober Life, Would try that Christian Comfort call'd a Wife. His Friends were summon'd on a Point so nice, To pass their Judgment, and to give Advice; But fix'd before, and well resolv'd was he: (As Men that ask Advice, are wont to be.) “My Friends, he cry'd (and cast a mournful Look “Around the Room, and sigh'd before he spoke:) “Beneath the Weight of threescore Years I bend, “And, worn with Cares, am hast'ning to my End; “How I have liv'd, alas! you know too well, “In worldly Follies, which I blush to tell; “But gracious Heav'n has op'd my Eyes at last, “With due Regret I view my Vices past; “And, as the Precept of the Church decrees, “Will take a Wife, and live in holy Ease. “But since by Counsel all things should be done, “And many Heads are wiser still than one; “Chuse you for me, who best shall be content, “When my Desire's approv'd by your Consent. “One Caution yet is needful to be told, “To guide your Choice: This Wife must not be old. “There goes a Saying, and 'twas shrewdly said, “Old Fish at Table, but young Flesh in Bed. “My Soul abhors the tastless, dry Embrace “Of a stale Virgin with a Winter-Face: “In that cold Season Love but treats his Guest “With Bean-Straw, and tough Forage at the best. “No crafty Widows shall approach my Bed; “Those are too wise for Bachelors to wed; “As subtile Clerks by many Schools are made, “Twice-marry'd Dames are Mistresses o'th' Trade: “But young and tender Virgins, rul'd with Ease, “We form like Wax, and mold them as we please. “Conceive me, Sirs, nor take my Sense amiss; “'Tis what concerns my Soul's eternal Bliss; “Since, if I found no Pleasure in my Spouse, “As Flesh is frail, and who (God help me) knows? “Then should I live in lewd Adultery, “And sink downright to Satan when I die. “Or, were I curs'd with an unfruitful Bed, “The righteous End were lost, for which I wed; “To raise up Seed to bless the Pow'rs above, “And not for Pleasure only, or for Love. “Think not I doat; 'tis time to take a Wife, “When vig'rous Blood forbids a chaster Life: “Those that are bless'd with Store of Grace divine, “May live like Saints, by Heav'n's Consent and mine. “And since I speak of Wedlock, let me say, “(As, thank my Stars, in modest Truth I may) “My Limbs are active; still I'm sound at Heart, “And a new Vigour springs in ev'ry Part. “Think not my Virtue lost, tho' Time has shed “These rev'rend Honours on my hoary Head: “Thus Trees are crown'd with Blossoms white as Snow, “The vital Sap then rising from below: “Old as I am, my lusty Limbs appear “Like Winter-Greens, that flourish all the Year. “Now, Sirs, you know to what I stand inclin'd; “Let ev'ry Friend with Freedom speak his Mind.” He said; the rest in diff'rent Parts divide, The knotty Point was urg'd on either Side: Marriage, the Theme on which they all declaim'd, Some prais'd with Wit, and some with Reason blam'd. Till, what with Proofs, Objections, and Replies, Each wondrous positive, and wondrous wise, There fell between his Brothers a Debate; Placebo this was call'd, and Justin that. First to the Knight Placebo thus begun (Mild were his Looks, and pleasing was his Tone: ‘Such Prudence, Sir, in all your Words appears,) ‘As plainly proves, Experience dwells with Years: ‘Yet you pursue sage Solomon's Advice, ‘To work by Counsel when Affairs are nice: ‘But, with the Wiseman's leave, I must protest, ‘(So may my Soul arrive at Ease and Rest, ‘As still I hold your own Advice the Best.) ‘Sir, I have liv'd a Courtier all my Days, ‘And study'd Men, their Manners, and their Ways; ‘And have observ'd this useful Maxim still, ‘To let my Betters always have their Will. ‘Nay, if my Lord affirm'd that Black was White, ‘My Word was this, your Honour's in the Right. ‘Th' assuming Wit, who deems himself so Wise, ‘As his mistaken Patron to advise, ‘Let him not dare to vent his dang'rous Thought; ‘A noble Fool was never in a Fault. ‘This, Sir, affects not you, whose ev'ry Word ‘Is weigh'd with Judgment, and befits a Lord: ‘Your Will is mine; and is (I will maintain) ‘Pleasing to God, and should be so to Man; ‘At least, your Courage all the World must praise, ‘Who dare to wed in your declining Days. ‘Indulge the Vigour of your mounting Blood, ‘And let grey Fools be indolently good, ‘Who, past all Pleasure, damn the Joys of Sense ‘With rev'rend Dulness and grave Impotence. Justin, who silent sate, and heard the Man, Thus, with a Philosophic Frown, began: ‘A Heathen Author, of the first Degree, ‘(Who, tho' not Faith, had Sense as well as we) ‘Bids us be certain our Concerns to trust ‘To those of gen'rous Principles, and just. ‘The Venture's greater, I'll presume to say, ‘To give your Person, than your Goods away: ‘And therefore, Sir, as you regard your Rest, ‘First learn your Lady's Qualities at least: ‘Whether she's chaste or rampant, proud or civil; ‘Meek as a Saint, or haughty as the Devil; ‘Whether an easy, fond, familiar Fool, ‘Or such a Wit as no man e'er can rule. ‘'Tis true, Perfection none must hope to find ‘In all this World, much less in Woman-kind; ‘But if her Virtues prove the larger Share, ‘Bless the kind Fates, and think your Fortune rare. ‘Ah, gentle Sir, take Warning of a Friend, ‘Who knows too well the State you thus commend; ‘And, spight of all his Praises, must declare, ‘All he can find is Bondage, Cost, and Care. ‘Heav'n knows, I shed full many a private Tear, ‘And sigh in Silence, lest the World should hear: ‘While all my Friends applaud my blissful Life, ‘And swear no Mortal's happier in a Wife; ‘Demure and chaste as any Vestal Nun, ‘The meekest Creature that beholds the Sun! ‘But, by th' immortal Pow'rs, I feel the Pain, ‘And he that smarts has Reason to complain. ‘Do what you list, for me; you must be sage, ‘And cautious sure; for Wisdom is in Age: ‘But at these Years, to venture on the Fair— ‘(By him, who made the Ocean, Earth, and Air,) ‘To please a Wife, when her Occasions call— ‘Would busy the most vig'rous of us all. ‘And trust me, Sir, the chastest you can chuse ‘Will ask Observance, and exact her Dues. ‘If what I speak my noble Lord offend, ‘My tedious Sermon here is at an End. “'Tis well, 'tis wondrous well, the Knight replies, “Most worthy Kinsman, faith you're mighty wise! “We, Sirs, are Fools, and must resign the Cause “To heath'nish Authors, Proverbs, and old Saws. (He spoke with Scorn, and turn'd another way:—) “What does my Friend, my dear Placebo say? ‘I say (quoth he) by Heav'n the Man's to blame, ‘To slander Wives, and Wedlock's holy Name. At this, the Council rose without delay; Each, in his own Opinion, went his way; With full Consent, that all Disputes appeas'd, The Knight should marry when and where he pleas'd. Who now but January exults with Joy? The Charms of Wedlock all his Soul employ: Each Nymph by Turns his wav'ring Mind possess'd And reign'd the short-liv'd Tyrant of his Breast; While Fancy pictur'd ev'ry lively Part, And each bright Image wander'd o'er his Heart. Thus, in some publick Forum fix'd on high, A Mirror shows the Figures moving by; Still one by one, in swift Succession, pass The gliding Shadows o'er the polish'd Glass. This Lady's Charms the nicest cou'd not blame, But vile Suspicions had aspers'd her Fame; That was with Sense, but not with Virtue, blest; And one had Grace, that wanted all the rest. Thus doubting long what Nymph he shou'd obey, He fix'd at last upon the youthful May. Her Faults he knew not, Love is always blind, But ev'ry Charm revolv'd within his Mind: Her tender Age, her Form divinely Fair! Her easy Motion, her attractive Air! Her sweet Behaviour, her enchanting Face! Her moving Softness, and majestic Grace! Much in his Prudence did our Knight rejoice, And thought no Mortal could dispute this Choice: Once more in haste he summon'd ev'ry Friend, And told them all, their Pains were at an end: “Heav'n, that (said he) inspir'd me first to wed, “Provides a Consort worthy of my Bed; “Let none oppose th' Election, since on this “Depends my Quiet, and my future Bliss. “A Dame there is, the Darling of my Eyes, “Young, Beauteous, Artless, Innocent and Wise; “Chaste, tho' not Rich, and tho' not nobly Born, “Of honest Parents, and may serve my turn. “Her will I wed, if gracious Heav'n so please; “To pass my Age in Sanctity and Ease: “And thank the Pow'rs, I may possess alone “The lovely Prize, and share my Bliss with none! “If you, my Friends, this Virgin can procure, “My Joys are full, my Happiness is sure. “One only Doubt remains: Full oft' I've heard, “By Casuists grave, and deep Divines averr'd; “That 'tis too much for human Race to know “The Bliss of Heav'n above, and Earth below. “Now should the nuptial Pleasures prove so great, “To match the Blessings of the future State, “Those endless Joys were ill exchang'd for these; “Then clear this Doubt, and set my Mind at Ease. This Justin heard; nor could his Spleen controul, Touch'd to the Quick, and tickled at the Soul. ‘Sir Knight (he cry'd) if this be all your Dread, ‘Heav'n put it past your Doubt, whene'er you wed; ‘And to my fervent Pray'rs so far consent, ‘That, e're the Rites are o'er, you may repent! ‘Good Heav'n, no doubt, the nuptial State approves, ‘Since it chastises still what best it loves: ‘Then be not, Sir, abandon'd to Despair; ‘Seek, and perhaps you'll find, among the Fair, ‘One that may do your Business to a Hair; ‘Not ev'n in Wish your Happiness delay, ‘But prove the Scourge to lash you on your Way: ‘Then to the Skies your mounting Soul shall go, ‘Swift as an Arrow soaring from the Bow. ‘Provided still, you moderate your Joy, ‘Nor in your Pleasures all your Might employ: ‘Let Reason's Rule your strong Desires abate, ‘Nor please too lavishly your gentle Mate. ‘Old Wives there are, of Judgment most acute, ‘Who solve these Questions beyond all Dispute; ‘Consult with those, and be of better Chear; ‘Marry, do Penance, and dismiss your Fear. So said, they rose, nor more the Work delay'd; The Match was offer'd, the Proposals made. The Parents, you may think, would soon comply; The Old have Int'rest ever in their Eye. Nor was it hard to move the Lady's Mind: When Fortune favours, still the Fair are kind. I pass each previous Settlement and Deed, Too long for me to write, or you to read: Nor will with quaint Impertinence display The Pomp, the Pageantry, the proud Array. The Time approach'd, to Church the Parties went, At once with carnal and devout Intent: Forth came the Priest, and bade th' obedient Wife, Like Sarah, or Rebecca, lead her Life. Then pray'd the Pow'rs the fruitful Bed to bless, And made all sure enough with Holiness. And now the Palace-Gates are open'd wide; The Guests appear in Order, Side by Side, And plac'd in State the Bridegroom and the Bride. The breathing Flute's soft Notes are heard around, And the shrill Trumpets mix their Silver Sound; The vaulted Roofs with echoing Musick ring, These touch the vocal Stops, and those the trembling String. Not thus Amphion tun'd the warbling Lyre, Nor Joab the sounding Clarion could inspire; Nor fierce Theodamas, whose sprightly Strain Could swell the Soul to Rage, and fire the Martial Train. Bacchus himself, the nuptial Feast to grace, (So Poets sing) was present on the Place: And lovely Venus, Goddess of Delight, Shook high her flaming Torch in open Sight, And danc'd around, and smil'd on ev'ry Knight: Pleas'd her best Servant would his Courage try, No less in Wedlock than in Liberty. Full many an Age old Hymen had not spy'd So kind a Bridegroom, or so bright a Bride. Ye Bards! renown'd among the tuneful Throng For gentle Lays, and joyous nuptial Song, Think not your softest Numbers can display The matchless Glories of this blissful Day; The Joys are such, as far transcend your Rage, When tender Youth has wedded stooping Age. The beauteous Dame sate smiling at the Board, And darted am'rous Glances at her Lord. Not Hester's self, whose Charms the Hebrews sing, E'er look'd so lovely on her Persian King: Bright as the rising Sun, in Summer's Day, And fresh and blooming as the Month of May! The joyful Knight survey'd her by his Side, Nor envy'd Paris with the Spartan Bride: Still, as his Mind revolv'd with vast Delight, Th' entrancing Raptures of th' approaching Night: Restless he sate, invoking ev'ry Pow'r To speed his Bliss, and haste the happy Hour. Meantime the vig'rous Dancers beat the Ground, And Songs were sung, and flowing Bowls went round; With od'rous Spices they perfum'd the Place, And Mirth and Pleasure shone in ev'ry Face. Damian alone, of all the menial Train, Sad in the midst of Triumphs, sigh'd for Pain; Damian alone, the Knight's obsequious Squire, Consum'd at Heart, and fed a secret Fire. His lovely Mistress all his Soul possess'd; He look'd, he languish'd, and could take no Rest: His Task perform'd, he sadly went his way, Fell on his Bed, and loath'd the Light of Day: There let him lie, till his relenting Dame Weep in her turn, and waste in equal Flame. The weary Sun, as learned Poets write, Forsook th' Horizon, and roll'd down the Light; While glitt'ring Stars his absent Beams supply, And Night's dark Mantle overspread the Sky. Then rose the Guests; and, as the time requir'd, Each paid his Thanks, and decently retir'd. The Foe once gone, our Knight prepar'd t'undress, So keen he was, and eager to possess: But first thought fit th' Assistance to receive, Which grave Physicians scruple not to give: Satyrion near, with hot Eringo's, stood Cantharides, to fire the lazy Blood; Whose Use old Bards describe in luscious Rhymes, And Critics learn'd explain to modern Times. By this the Sheets were spread, the Bride undress'd, The Room was sprinkl'd, and the Bed was bless'd. What next ensu'd, beseems not me to say; 'Tis sung, he labour'd till the dawning Day; Then briskly sprung from Bed, with Heart so light, As all were nothing he had done by Night; And sipp'd his Cordial, as he sate upright: He kiss'd his balmy Spouse with wanton Play, And feebly sung a lusty Roundelay. Then on the Couch his weary Limbs he cast; For ev'ry Labour must have Rest at last. But anxious Cares the pensive Squire oppress'd, Sleep fled his Eyes, and Peace forsook his Breast; The raging Flames that in his Bosom dwell, He wanted Art to hide, and Means to tell. Yet hoping Time th' Occasion might betray, Compos'd a Sonnet to the lovely May; Which writ, and folded with the nicest Art, He wrapp'd in Silk, and laid upon his Heart. When now the fourth revolving Day was run, ('Twas June, and Cancer had receiv'd the Sun) Forth from her Chamber came the beauteous Bride; The good old Knight mov'd slowly by her Side. High Mass was sung; they feasted in the Hall; The Servants round stood ready at their Call. The Squire alone was absent from the Board, And much his Sickness griev'd his worthy Lord, Who pray'd his Spouse, attended by her Train, To visit Damian, and divert his Pain. Th' obliging Dames obey'd with one Consent; They left the Hall, and to his Lodging went. The Female Tribe surround him as he lay, And close beside him sate the gentle May: Where, as she try'd his Pulse, he softly drew A speaking Sigh, and cast a mournful View; Then gave his Bill, and brib'd the Pow'rs divine With secret Vows, to favour his Design. Who studies now, but discontented May? On her soft Couch uneasily she lay: The lumpish Husband snoar'd away the Night, Till Coughs awak'd him near the Morning-Light. What then he did, I not presume to tell, Nor if she thought herself in Heav'n or Hell: Honest and dull in nuptial Bed they lay, Till the Bell toll'd, and all arose to pray. Were it by forceful Destiny decreed, Or did from Chance, or Nature's Pow'r proceed; Or that some Star, with Aspect kind to Love, Shed its selectest Infl'ence from above; Whatever was the Cause, the tender Dame Felt the first Motions of an infant Flame; Receiv'd th' Impressions of the Love-sick Squire, And wasted in the soft infectious Fire. Ye Fair, draw near, let May's Example move Your gentle Minds to pity those who love! Had some fierce Tyrant in her Stead been found, The poor Adorer, sure, had hang'd or drown'd; But she, your Sex's Mirrour, free from Pride, Was much too meek to prove a Homicide. But, to my Tale: Some Sages have defin'd Pleasure the sov'reign Bliss of Human-kind: Our Knight (who study'd much, we may suppose) Deriv'd his high Philosophy from those; For, like a Prince, he bore the vast Expence Of lavish Pomp and proud Magnificence: His House was stately, his Retinue gay, Large was his Train, and gorgeous his Array, His spacious Garden, made to yield to none, Was compass'd round with Walls of solid Stone: Priapus could not half describe the Grace (Tho' God of Gardens) of this charming Place: A Place to tire the rambling Wits of France In long Descriptions, and exceed Romance; Enough to shame the gentlest Bard that sings Of painted Meadows, and of purling Springs. Full in the Center of the flow'ry Ground, A Crystal Fountain spread its Streams around, The fruitful Banks with verdant Laurels crown'd: About this Spring (if ancient Fame says true) The dapper Elves their Moon-light Sports pursue; Their pigmy King, and little Fairy Queen, In circling Dances gambol'd on the Green, While tuneful Sprites a merry Concert made, And airy Music warbled thro' the Shade. Hither the noble Knight would oft' repair, (His Scene of Pleasure, and peculiar Care) For this he held it dear, and always bore The Silver Key that lock'd the Garden-Door. To this sweet Place, in Summer's sultry Heat, He us'd from Noise and Bus'ness to retreat; And here in Dalliance spend the live-long Day, Solus cum sola, with his sprightly May. For, whate'er Work was undischarg'd a-bed, The duteous Knight in this fair Garden sped. But ah! what Mortal lives of Bliss secure? How short a Space our worldly Joys endure! O Fortune, fair, like all thy treach'rous Kind, But faithless still, and wav'ring as the Wind! O painted Monster! form'd Mankind to cheat With pleasing Poison, and with soft Deceit! This rich, this am'rous, venerable Knight, Amidst his Ease, his Solace, and Delight, Struck blind by Thee, resigns his Days to Grief, And calls on Death, the Wretch's last Relief. The Rage of Jealousy then seiz'd his Mind; For much he fear'd the Faith of Womankind. His Wife, not suffer'd from his Side to stray, Was Captive kept; he watch'd her Night and Day, Abridg'd her Pleasures, and confin'd her Sway. Full oft in Tears did hapless May complain, And sigh'd full oft; but sigh'd and wept in vain: She look'd on Damian with a Lover's Eye: For oh, 'twas fix'd; she must possess, or die! Nor less Impatience vex'd her am'rous Squire, Wild with Delay, and burning with Desire. Watch'd as she was, yet could he not refrain By secret Writing to disclose his Pain: The Dame by Signs reveal'd her kind Intent, Till both were conscious what each other meant. Ah, gentle Knight! what would thy Eyes avail, Tho' they could see as far as Ships can sail? 'Tis better sure, when blind, deceiv'd to be, Than be deluded when a Man can see. Argus himself, so cautious and so wise, Was over-watch'd, for all his hundred Eyes: So many an honest Husband may, 'tis known, Who, wisely, never thinks the Case his own. The Dame at last, by Diligence and Care, Procur'd the Key her Knight was wont to bear; She took the Wards in Wax before the Fire, And gave th' Impression to the trusty Squire. By means of this, some Wonder shall appear, Which in due Place and Season you may hear. Well sung sweet Ovid in the Days of yore, What Slight is that which Love will not explore? And Pyramus and Thisbe plainly shew, The Feats true Lovers, when they list, can do: Tho' watch'd and captive, yet, in spite of all, They found the Art of kissing thro' a Wall. But now no longer from our Tale to stray; It happ'd, that once upon a Summer's Day, Our rev'rend Knight was urg'd to am'rous Play: He rais'd his Spouse, e're Matin-Bell was rung, And thus his Morning-Canticle he sung: “Awake, my Love, disclose thy radiant Eyes; “Arise, my Wife, my beauteous Lady, rise! “Hear how the Doves with pensive Notes complain, “And in soft Murmurs tell the Trees their Pain; “The Winter's past; the Clouds and Tempests fly; “The Sun adorns the Fields, and brightens all the Sky. “Fair without Spot, whose ev'ry charming Part “My Bosom wounds, and captivates my Heart: “Come, and in mutual Pleasures let's engage, “Joy of my Life, and Comfort of my Age.’ This heard, to Damian strait a Sign she made, To haste before; the gentle Squire obey'd: Secret, and undescry'd, he took his Way, And ambush'd close behind an Arbour lay. It was not long e're January came, And Hand in Hand with him his lovely Dame: Blind as he was, not doubting all was sure, He turn'd the Key, and made the Gate secure. “Here let us walk (he said) observ'd by none, “Conscious of Pleasures to the World unknown: “So may my Soul have Joy, as thou, my Wife, “Art far the dearest Solace of my Life; “And rather would I chuse, by Heav'n above, “To die this instant, than to lose thy Love. “Reflect what Truth was in my Passion shown, “When unendow'd, I took thee for my own, “And sought no Treasure, but thy Heart alone. “Old as I am, and now depriv'd of Sight, “While thou art faithful to thy own true Knight, “Nor Age, nor Blindness rob me of Delight. “Each other Loss with Patience I can bear, “The Loss of Thee is what I only fear. “Consider then, my Lady, and my Wife, “The solid Comforts of a virtuous Life. “As first, the Love of Christ himself you gain; “Next, your own Honour undefil'd maintain; “And lastly, that which sure your Mind must move, “My whole Estate shall gratify your Love: “Make your own Terms, and e're to-morrow's Sun “Displays his Light, by Heav'n it shall be done. “I seal the Contract with an holy Kiss, “And will perform, by this—my Dear, and this— “Have Comfort, Spouse, nor think thy Lord unkind; “'Tis Love, not Jealousy, that fires my Mind. “For when thy Charms my sober Thoughts engage, “And join'd to them my own unequal Age; “From thy dear Side I have no Pow'r to part, “Such secret Transports warm my melting Heart. “For who, that once possess'd those heav'nly Charms, “Could live one Moment absent from thy Arms'? He ceas'd; and May, with modest Grace reply'd, (Weak was her Voice, as while she spoke she cry'd:) ‘Heav'n knows, (with that, a tender Sigh she drew) ‘I have a Soul to save, as well as you; ‘And, what no less you to my Charge commend, ‘My dearest Honour, will to Death defend. ‘To you in holy Church I gave my Hand, ‘And join'd my Heart in Wedlock's sacred Band: ‘Yet after this, if you distrust my Care, ‘Then hear, my Lord, and witness what I swear: ‘First, may the yawning Earth her Bosom rend, ‘And let me hence to Hell alive descend; ‘Or die the Death I dread no less than Hell, ‘Sow'd in a Sack, and plung'd into a Well: ‘E're I my Fame by one lewd Act disgrace, ‘Or once renounce the Honour of my Race. ‘For know, Sir Knight, of gentle Blood I came; ‘I loath a Whore, and startle at the Name. ‘But jealous Men on their own Crimes reflect, ‘And learn from thence their Ladies to suspect: ‘Else, why these needless Cautions, Sir, to me? ‘These Doubts and Fears of Female Constancy? ‘This Chime still rings in ev'ry Lady's Ear, ‘The only Strain a Wife must hope to hear.” Thus, while she spoke, a sidelong Glance she cast, Where Damion kneeling, worshipp'd as she pass'd. She saw him watch the Motions of her Eye, And singled out a Pear-Tree planted nigh: 'Twas charg'd with Fruit that made a goodly Show, And hung with dangling Pears was ev'ry Bough. Thither th' obsequious Squire address'd his Pace, And climbing, in the Summit took his place: The Knight and Lady walk'd beneath in View, Where let us leave them, and our Tale pursue. 'Twas now the Season, when the glorious Sun His heav'nly Progress thro' the Twins had run; And Jove, exalted, his mild Infl'ence yields, To glad the Glebe, and paint the flow'ry Fields. Clear was the Day, and Phœbus rising bright, Had streak'd the azure Firmament with Light: He pierc'd the glitt'ring Clouds with Golden Streams, And warm'd the Womb of Earth with genial Beams. It so befel, in that fair Morning-tide, The Fairies sported on the Garden's Side, And, in the midst, their Monarch and his Bride. So featly tripp'd the light-foot Ladies round, The Knights so nimbly o'er the Greensword bound, That scarce they bent the Flow'rs, or touch'd the Ground. The Dances ended, all the Fairy Train For Pinks and Daisies search'd the flow'ry Plain; While on a Bank reclin'd, of rising Green, Thus, with a Frown, the King bespoke his Queen: “'Tis too apparent, argue what you can, “The Treachery you Women use to Man: “A thousand Authors have this Truth made out, “And sad Experience leaves no room for Doubt. “Heav'n rest thy Spirit, noble Solomon, “A wiser Monarch never saw the Sun: “All Wealth, all Honours, the supreme Degree “Of earthly Bliss, was well bestow'd on Thee! “For sagely hast thou said, Of all Mankind, “One only just and righteous, hope to find. “But, should'st thou search the spacious World around, “Yet one good Woman is not to be found. “Thus says the King who knew your Wickedness; “The Son of Sirach testifies no less. “So may some Wild-fire on your Bodies fall, “Or some devouring Plague consume you all; “As well you view the Leacher in the Tree, “And well this honourable Knight you see: “But since he's blind and old (a helpless Case!) “His Squire shall cuckold him before your Face. “Now, by my own dread Majesty I swear, “And by this awful Sceptre which I bear, “No impious Wretch shall 'scape unpunish'd long, “That in my Presence offers such a Wrong. “I will this Instant undeceive the Knight, “And, in the very Act, restore his Sight; “And set the Strumpet here in open View, “A Warning to these Ladies, and to You, “And all the faithless Sex, for ever to be true. ‘And will you so, reply'd the Queen, indeed? ‘Now, by my Mother's Soul, it is decreed, ‘She shall not want an Answer at her Need. ‘For her, and for her Daughters, I'll engage, ‘And all the Sex in each succeeding Age: ‘Art shall be theirs, to varnish an Offence, ‘And fortify their Crimes with Confidence. ‘Nay, were they taken in a strict Embrace, ‘Seen with both Eyes, and pinion'd on the Place; ‘All they shall need, is, to protest and swear, ‘Breathe a soft Sigh, and drop a tender Tear; ‘Till their wise Husbands, gull'd by Arts like these, ‘Grow gentle, tractable, and tame as Geese. ‘What tho' this sland'rous Jew, this Solomon, ‘Call'd Women Fools, and knew full many a one? ‘The wiser Wits of later Times declare, ‘How constant, chaste, and virtuous Women are: ‘Witness the Martyrs, who resign'd their Breath, ‘Serene in Torments, unconcern'd in Death: ‘And witness next, what Roman Authors tell, ‘How Arria, Portia, and Lucretia fell. ‘But since the sacred Leaves to all are free, ‘And Men interpret Texts, why should not we? ‘By this, no more was meant, than to have shown, ‘That sov'reign Goodness dwells in Him alone, ‘Who only Is, and is but only One. ‘But grant the worst, shall Women then be weigh'd ‘By ev'ry Word that Solomon has said? ‘What tho' this King (as ancient Story boasts) ‘Built a fair Temple to the Lord of Hosts; ‘He ceas'd at last his Maker to adore, ‘And did as much for Idol-Gods, or more. ‘Beware that lavish Praises you confer ‘On a rank Leacher and Idolater; ‘Whose Reign indulgent God (says holy Writ) ‘Did but for David's righteous Sake permit; ‘David, the Monarch after Heav'n's own Mind, ‘Who lov'd our Sex, and honour'd all our Kind. ‘Well, I'm a Woman, and as such must speak; ‘Silence would swell me, and my Heart would break. ‘Know then, I scorn your dull Authorities, ‘Your idle Wits, and all their learned Lyes. ‘By Heav'n, those Authors are our Sex's Foes, ‘Whom, in our Right, I must and will oppose. “Nay (quoth the King) dear Madam, be not wroth: “I yield it up; but since I gave my Oath, “That this much-injur'd Knight again should see, “It must be done—I am a King, said he, “And one, whose Faith has ever sacred been.” ‘And so has mine (she said)—I am a Queen; ‘Her Answer she shall have, I undertake; ‘And thus an End of all Dispute I make. ‘Try when you list; and you shall find, my Lord, ‘It is not in our Sex to break our Word.’ We leave them here in this heroick Strain, And to the Knight our Story turns again; Who in the Garden, with his lovely May, Sung merrier than the Cuckow or the Jay: This was his Song, “Oh, kind and constant be; “Constant and kind I'll ever prove to thee. Thus singing as he went, at last he drew, By easy Steps, to where the Pear-tree grew: The longing Dame look'd up, and spy'd her Love Full fairly perch'd among the Boughs above. She stopp'd; and sighing: ‘Oh, good Gods, she cry'd, ‘What Pangs, what sudden Shoots distend my Side! ‘Oh, for the tempting Fruit, so fresh, so green;— ‘Help, for the Love of Heav'n's immortal Queen! ‘Help, dearest Lord, and save at once the Life ‘Of thy poor Infant, and thy longing Wife! Sore sigh'd the Knight, to hear his Lady's Cry; But could not climb, and had no Servant nigh: Old as he was, and void of Eye-sight too, What could, alas! the helpless Husband do? ‘And must I languish then (she said) and die, ‘Yet view the lovely Fruit before my Eye? ‘At least, kind Sir, for Charity's sweet Sake, ‘Vouchsafe the Trunk between your Arms to take; ‘Then from your Back I might ascend the Tree; ‘Do you but stoop, and leave the rest to me. “With all my Soul (he thus reply'd again) “I'd spend my dearest Blood to ease thy Pain.” With that, his Back against the Trunk he bent; She seiz'd a Twig, and up the Tree she went. Now prove your Patience, gentle Ladies all! Nor let on me your heavy Anger fall: 'Tis Truth I tell, tho' not in Phrase refin'd; Tho' blunt my Tale, yet honest is my Mind. What Feats the Lady in the Tree might do, I pass, as Gambols never known to you: But sure, it was a merrier Fit, she swore, Than in her Life she ever felt before. In that nice Moment, lo! the wond'ring Knight Look'd out, and stood restor'd to sudden Sight. Strait on the Tree his eager Eyes he bent, As one, whose Thoughts were on his Spouse intent; But when he saw his Bosom-Wife so dress'd, His Rage was such as cannot be express'd: Not frantic Mothers, when their Infants die, With louder Clamours rend the vaulted Sky: He cry'd, he roar'd, he storm'd, he tore his Hair; “Death! Hell! and Furies! what dost thou do there?” ‘What ails my Lord? the trembling Dame reply'd; ‘I thought your Patience had been better try'd: ‘Is this your Love, ungrateful and unkind? ‘This my Reward for having cur'd the Blind? ‘Why was I taught to make my Husband see, ‘By struggling with a Man upon a Tree? ‘Did I, for this, the Pow'r of Magic prove? ‘Unhappy Wife, whose Crime was too much Love! “If this be struggling, by this holy Light, “'Tis struggling with a Vengeance (quoth the Knight.) “So Heav'n preserve the Sight it has restor'd, “As with these Eyes I plainly saw thee whor'd; “Whor'd by my Slave—Perfidious Wretch! may Hell “As surely seize thee, as I saw too well. ‘Guard me, good Angels! cry'd the gentle May, ‘Pray Heav'n, this Magic work the proper Way! ‘Alas, my Love! 'tis certain, could you see, ‘You ne'er had us'd these killing Words to me: ‘So help me, Fates, as 'tis no perfect Sight, ‘But some faint Glimm'ring of a doubtful Light.’ “What I have said (quoth he) I must maintain; “For, by th' immortal Pow'rs, it seem'd too plain— ‘By all those Pow'rs, some Frenzy seiz'd your Mind, ‘(Reply'd the Dame) are these the Thanks I find? ‘Wretch that I am, that e'er I was so kind! She said; a rising Sigh express'd her Woe, The ready Tears apace began to flow, And as they fell, she wip'd from either Eye The Drops (for Women, when they list, can cry.) The Knight was touch'd, and in his Looks appear'd Signs of Remorse, while thus his Spouse he chear'd: “Madam, 'tis past, and my short Anger o'er; “Come down, and vex your tender Heart no more: “Excuse me, Dear, if aught amiss was said; “For, on my Soul, Amends shall soon be made: “Let my Repentance your Forgiveness draw; “By Heav'n, I swore but what I thought I saw.” ‘Ah, my lov'd Lord! 'twas much unkind (she cry'd) ‘On bare Suspicion thus to treat your Bride. ‘But till your Sight's establish'd for a while, ‘Imperfect Objects may your Sense beguile. ‘Thus when from Sleep we first our Eyes display, ‘The Balls are wounded with the piercing Ray, ‘And dusky Vapours rise, and intercept the Day: ‘So just recov'ring from the Shades of Night, ‘Your swimming Eyes are drunk with sudden Light, ‘Strange Phantoms dance around, and skim before your Sight. ‘Then, Sir, be cautious, nor too rashly deem; ‘Heav'n knows, how seldom Things are what they seem! ‘Consult your Reason, and you soon shall find, ‘'Twas You were jealous, not your Wife unkind: ‘Jove ne'er spoke Oracle more true than this, ‘None judge so wrong, as those who think amiss. With that she leap'd into her Lord's Embrace, With well-dissembled Virtue in her Face. He hugg'd her close, and kiss'd her o'er and o'er, Disturb'd with Doubts and Jealousies no more: Both, pleas'd and bless'd, renew'd their mutual Vows, A fruitful Wife, and a believing Spouse. Thus ends our Tale, whose Moral next to make, Let all wise Husbands hence Example take; And pray, to crown the Pleasure of their Lives, To be so well deluded by their Wives. End of the Merchant's TALE. PROLOGUE TO THE Wife of Bath's Tale. By the same Hand. Behold The Wife of Bath speaks. the Woes of Matrimonial Life, And hear with Rev'rence an experienc'd Wife! To dear-bought Wisdom give the Credit due, And think, for once, a Woman tells you true. In all these Trials I have borne a Part, I was myself the Scourge that caus'd the Smart: For, since Fifteen, in Triumph have I led Five captive Husbands from the Church to Bed. Christ saw a Wedding once, the Scripture says, And saw but one, 'tis thought, in all his Days: Whence some infer, whose Conscience is too nice, No pious Christian ought to marry twice. But let them read, and solve me, if they can, The Words address'd to the Samaritan. Five times in lawful Wedlock she was join'd; And sure the certain Stint was ne'er defin'd. Increase and Multiply, was Heav'n's Command, And that's a Text I clearly understand. This too, Let Men their Sires and Mothers leave, And to their dearer Wives for ever cleave. More Wives than one by Solomon were try'd, Or else the Wisest of Mankind's bely'd. I've had myself full many a merry Fit; And trust in Heav'n I may have many yet. For when my transitory Spouse, unkind, Shall die, and leave his woeful Wife behind, I'll take the next good Christian I can find. Paul, knowing one could never serve our turn, Declar'd, 'twas better far to wed than burn. There's Danger in assembling Fire and Tow; I grant 'em that; and what it means, you know. The same Apostle too has elsewhere own'd, No Precept for Virginity he found: 'Tis but a Counsel—and we Women still Take which we like, the Counsel, or our Will. I envy not their Bliss, if he or she Think fit to live in perfect Chastity; Pure let them be, and free from Taint of Vice; I, for a few slight Spots, am not so nice. Heav'n calls us different Ways, on These bestows One proper Gift, another grants to Those: Not ev'ry Man's oblig'd to sell his Store, And give up all his Substance to the Poor; Such, as are perfect, may, I can't deny; But, by your Leave, Divines, so am not I. Full many a Saint, since first the World began, Liv'd an unspotted Maid, in spite of Man: Let such (a God's Name) with fine Wheat be fed, And let us honest Wives eat Barley-bread. For me, I'll keep the Post assign'd by Heav'n, And use the copious Talent it has giv'n: Let my good Spouse pay Tribute, do me Right, And keep an equal Reck'ning ev'ry Night, His proper Body is not his, but mine; For so said Paul, and Paul's a sound Divine. Know then, of those five Husbands I have had, Three were just tolerable, two were bad. The three were old, but rich and fond beside, And toil'd most piteously to please their Bride: But since their Wealth (the best they had) was mine, The rest, without much Loss, I could resign. Sure to be lov'd, I took no Pains to please, Yet had more Pleasure far than they had Ease. Presents flow'd in apace: with Show'rs of Gold They made their Court, like Jupiter of old. If I but smil'd, a sudden Youth they found, And a new Palsy seiz'd them when I frown'd. Ye sov'reign Wives! give ear, and understand; Thus shall ye speak, and exercise Command. For never was it giv'n to mortal Man, To lye so boldly as a Woman can. Forswear the Fact, tho' seen with both his Eyes, And call her Maids to witness how he lyes. ‘Hark, old Sir Paul! ('twas thus I us'd to say) ‘Whence is our Neighbour's Wife so rich and gay? ‘Treated, caress'd, where-e'er she's pleas'd to roam? ‘I sit in Tatters, and immur'd at Home. ‘Why to her House dost thou so oft repair? ‘Art thou so am'rous? and is she so fair? ‘If I but see a Cousin, or a Friend, ‘Lord! how you swell, and rage like any Fiend! ‘But you reel Home, a drunken beastly Bear, ‘Then preach till Midnight in your easy Chair, ‘Cry, Wives are false, and ev'ry Woman evil, ‘And give up all that's Female to the Devil. ‘If poor, (you say) she drains her Husband's Purse; ‘If rich, she keeps her Priest, or something worse; ‘If highly born, intolerably vain, ‘Vapours and Pride by turn possess her Brain; ‘Now gayly mad, now sourly splenetick, ‘Freakish when well, and fretful when she's sick. ‘If fair, then chaste she cannot long abide, ‘By pressing Youth attack'd on ev'ry side. ‘If foul, her Wealth the lusty Lover lures, ‘Or else her Wit some Fool-gallant procures; ‘Or else she dances with becoming Grace, ‘Or Shape excuses the Defects of Face. ‘There swims no Goose so grey, but, soon or late, ‘She finds some honest Gander for her Mate. ‘Horses (thou say'st) and Asses, Men may try, ‘And ring suspected Vessels e'er they buy: ‘But Wives, a random Choice, untry'd they take, ‘They dream in Courtship, but in Wedlock wake: ‘Then, nor till then, the Veil's remov'd away, ‘And all the Woman glares in open Day. ‘You tell me, to preserve your Wife's good Grace, ‘Your Eyes must always languish on my Face; ‘Your Tongue with constant Flatt'ries feed my Ear, ‘And tag each Sentence with, My Life! my Dear! ‘If, by strange Chance, a modest Blush be rais'd, ‘Be sure my fine Complexion must be prais'd. ‘My Garments always must be new and gay, ‘And Feasts still kept upon my Wedding-Day. ‘Then must my Nurse be pleas'd, and fav'rite Maid; ‘And endless Treats, and endless Visits paid ‘To a long Train of Kindred, Friends, Allies; ‘All this thou say'st, and all thou say'st are Lyes. ‘On Jenkin too you cast a squinting Eye: ‘What! can your Prentice raise your Jealousy? ‘Fresh are his ruddy Cheeks, his Forehead fair, ‘And like the burnish'd Gold his curling Hair. ‘But clear thy wrinkled Brow, and quit thy Sorrow, ‘I'd scorn your Prentice, should you die to-morrow. ‘Why are thy Chests all lock'd? on what Design ‘Are not thy worldly Goods and Treasure mine? ‘Sir, I'm no Fool; nor shall you, by St. John, ‘Have Goods and Body to yourself alone; ‘One you shall quit, in spite of both your Eyes— ‘I heed not, I, the Bolts, the Locks, the Spies. ‘If you had Wit, you'd say, “Go where you will, “Dear Spouse; I credit not the Tales they tell: “Take all the Freedoms of a married Life; “I know thee for a virtuous, faithful Wife.” ‘Lord, when you have enough, what need you care ‘How merrily soever others fare? ‘Tho' all the Day I give and take Delight, ‘Doubt not, sufficient will be left at Night, ‘'Tis but a just and rational Desire, ‘To light a Taper at a Neighbour's Fire. ‘There's Danger too, you think, in rich Array, ‘And none can long be modest that are gay; ‘The Cat, if you but sindge her tabby Skin, ‘The Chimney keeps, and sits content within; ‘But once grown sleek, will from her Corner run, ‘Sport with her Tail, and wanton in the Sun: ‘She licks her fair round Face, and frisks abroad, ‘To show her Furr, and to be catterwaw'd.’ Lo thus, my Friends, I wrought to my Desires These three right-ancient venerable Sires. I told 'em, Thus you say, and thus you do— And told 'em false; but Jenkin swore 'twas true. I, like a Dog, could bite as well as whine, And first complain'd, whene'er the Guilt was mine. I tax'd them oft with Wenching and Amours, When their weak Legs scarce dragg'd 'em out of Doors; And swore, the Rambles that I took by Night, Were all to spy what Damsels they bedight. That Colour brought me many Hours of Mirth; For all this Wit is giv'n us from our Birth. Heav'n gave to Woman the peculiar Grace To spin, to weep, and cully human Race. By this nice Conduct, and this prudent Course, By Murm'ring, Wheedling, Stratagem, and Force, I still prevail'd, and would be in the Right, Or Curtain-Lectures made a restless Night. If once my Husband's Arm was o'er my Side, What! so familiar with your Spouse? I cry'd: I levy'd first a Tax upon his Need; Then let him—'twas a Nicety indeed! Let all Mankind this certain Maxim hold, Marry who will, our Sex is to be sold. With empty Hands no Tassels can you lure; But fulsome Love for Gain we can endure: For Gold we love the Impotent and Old, And heave, and pant, and kiss, and cling for Gold. Yet with Embraces, Curses oft' I mixt; Then kiss'd again, and chid and rail'd betwixt. Well, I may make my Will in Peace, and die; For not one Word in Man's Arrears am I. To drop a dear Dispute I was unable, Ev'n tho' the Pope himself had set at Table. But when my Point was gain'd, then thus I spoke: “Billy, my Dear, how sheepishly you look! “Approach, my Spouse, and let me kiss thy Cheek; “Thou should'st be always thus, resign'd and meek! “Of Job's great Patience since so oft' you preach, “Well should you practise, who so well can teach. “'Tis difficult to do, I must allow; “But I, my Dearest, will instruct you how. “Great is the Blessing of a prudent Wife, “Who puts a Period to domestic Strife. “One of us two must rule, and one obey; “And since in Man right Reason bears the Sway, “Let that frail Thing, weak Woman, have her Way. “The Wives of all my Family have rul'd “Their tender Husbands, and their Passions cool'd. “Fye, 'tis unmanly thus to sigh and groan; “What! would you have me to yourself alone? “Why, take me, Love! take all and ev'ry Part! “Here's your Revenge! you love it at your Heart. “Would I vouchsafe to sell what Nature gave, “You little think what Custom I could have. “But see! I'm all your own—nay, hold—for shame! “What means my Dear—indeed—you are to blame.” Thus with my first three Lords I pass'd my Life, A very Woman, and a very Wife. What Sums from these old Spouses I could raise, Procur'd young Husbands in my riper Days. Tho' past my Bloom, not yet decay'd was I, Wanton and wild, and chatter'd like a Pye. In Country-Dances still I bore the Bell, And sung as sweet as Evening-Philomel. To clear my Quail-Pipe, and refresh my Soul, Full oft I drain'd the spicy Nut-brown Bowl; Rich luscious Wines, that youthful Blood improve, And warm the swelling Veins to Feats of Love: For 'tis as sure, as Cold engenders Hail, A liqu'rish Mouth must have a lech'rous Tail: Wine lets no Lover unrewarded go, As all true Gamesters by Experience know. But oh, good Gods! whene'er a Thought I cast On all the Joys of Youth and Beauty past, To find in Pleasures I have had my Part, Still warms me to the Bottom of my Heart. This wicked World was once my dear Delight; Now all my Conquests, all my Charms, good night! The Flour consum'd, the best that now I can Is e'en to make my Market of the Bran. My fourth dear Spouse was not exceeding true: He kept, 'twas thought, a private Miss, or two: But all that Score I paid—as how? you'll say; Not with my Body, in a filthy Way: But I so dress'd, and danc'd, and drank, and din'd; And view'd a Friend, with Eyes so very kind, As stung his Heart, and made his Marrow fry With burning Rage, and frantick Jealousy. His Soul, I hope, enjoys eternal Glory; For here on Earth I was his Purgatory. Oft', when his Shoe the most severely wrung, He put on careless Airs, and sat and sung. How sore I gall'd him, only Heav'n could know, And he that felt, and I that caus'd the Woe. He dy'd, when last from Pilgrimage I came, With other Gossips, from Jerusalem; And now lies buried underneath a Rood, Fair to be seen, and rear'd of honest Wood. A Tomb, indeed, with fewer Sculptures grac'd, Than that Mausolus' pious Widow plac'd; Or where inshrin'd the great Darius lay; But Cost on Graves is merely thrown away. The Pit fill'd up, with Turf we cover'd o'er; So, bless the good Man's Soul; I say no more. Now for my fifth lov'd Lord, the last and best; (Kind Heav'n afford him everlasting Rest) Full hearty was his Love; and I can shew The Tokens on my Ribs in Black and Blue: Yet, with a Knack, my Heart he could have won, While yet the Smart was shooting in the Bone. How quaint an Appetite in Women reigns! Free Gifts we scorn, and love what costs us Pains: Let Men avoid us, and on them we leap; A glutted Market makes Provision cheap. In pure good Will I took this jovial Spark; Of Oxford he, a most egregious Clerk. He boarded with a Widow in the Town, A trusty Gossip, one Dame Alison. Full well the Secrets of my Soul she knew, Better than e'er our Parish-Priest could do. To her I told whatever could befall; Had but my Husband piss'd against a Wall, Or done a thing that might have cost his Life, She—and my Niece—and one more worthy Wife, Had known it all: What most he would conceal, To these I made no scruple to reveal. Oft' has he blush'd from Ear to Ear for Shame, That e'er he told a Secret to his Dame. It so befel, in holy Time of Lent, That oft' a Day I to this Gossip went; (My Husband, thank my Stars, was out of Town) From House to House we rambled up and down, This Clerk, my self, and my good Neighbour Alce, To see, be seen, to tell, and gather Tales. Visits to ev'ry Church we daily paid, And march'd in ev'ry holy Masquerade; The Stations duly, and the Vigils kept; Not much we fasted, but scarce ever slept. At Sermons too I shone in Scarlet gay; The wasting Moth ne'er spoil'd my best Array; The Cause was this, I wore it ev'ry Day. 'Twas when fresh May her early Blossoms yields, This Clerk and I were walking in the Fields. We grew so intimate, I can't tell how, I pawn'd my Honour, and engag'd my Vow, If e'er I laid my Husband in his Urn, That He, and only He, should serve my turn. We strait struck Hands, the Bargain was agreed; I still have Shifts against a Time of Need: The Mouse that always trusts to one poor Hole, Can never be a Mouse of any Soul. I vow'd, I scarce could sleep since first I knew him, And durst be sworn he had bewitch'd me to him; If e'er I slept, I dream'd of him alone, And Dreams foretel, as learned Men have shown: All this I said; but Dream, Sirs, I had none: I follow'd but my crafty Crony's Lore, Who bid me tell this Lye—and twenty more. Thus Day by Day, and Month by Month we past; It pleas'd the Lord to take my Spouse at last. I tore my Gown, I soil'd my Locks with Dust, And beat my Breasts, as wretched Widows—must. Before my Face my Handkerchief I spread, To hide the Flood of Tears I did—not shed. The good Man's Coffin to the Church was borne; Around, the Neighbours, and my Clerk too mourn. But as he march'd, good Gods! he shew'd a Pair Of Legs and Feet, so clean, so strong, so fair! Of twenty Winters Age he seem'd to be; I (to say Truth) was twenty more than he: But vig'rous still, a lively buxom Dame; And had a wond'rous Gift to quench a Flame. A Conj'rer once, that deeply could divine, Assur'd me, Mars in Taurus was my Sign. As the Stars order'd, such my Life has been: Alas, alas, that ever Love was Sin! Fair Venus gave me Fire, and sprightly Grace, And Mars Assurance, and a dauntless Face. By virtue of this pow'rful Constellation, I follow'd always my own Inclination. But to my Tale: A Month scarce pass'd away, With Dance and Song we kept the nuptial Day. All I possess'd, I gave to his Command, My Goods and Chattels, Money, House and Land: But oft' repented, and repent it still; He prov'd a Rebel to my sov'reign Will: Nay once, by Heav'n, he struck me on the Face; Hear but the Fact, and judge yourselves the Case. Stubborn as any Lioness was I; And knew full well to raise my Voice on high; As true a Rambler as I was before, And would be so, in spite of all he swore. He, against this right sagely would advise, And old Examples set before my Eyes; Tell how the Roman Matrons led their Life, Of Gracchus' Mother, and Duilius' Wife; And chose the Sermon, as beseem'd his Wit, With some grave Sentence out of holy Writ. Oft would he say, “Who builds his House on Sands, “Pricks his blind Horse across the fallow Lands; “Or lets his Wife abroad with Pilgrims roam, “Deserves a Fool's Cap and long Ears at home.” All this avail'd not: For whoe'er he be That tells my Faults, I hate him mortally: And so do Numbers more, I'll boldly say, Men, Women, Clergy, Regular and Lay. My Spouse (who was, you know, to Learning bred) A certain Treatise oft' at Evening read; Where divers Authors (whom the Dev'l confound For all their Lyes) were in one Volume bound. Valerius, whole; and of St. Jerome, part; Chrysippus and Tertullian, Ovid's Art, Solomon's Proverbs, Eloisa's Loves; And many more than sure the Church approves. More Legends were there here, of wicked Wives, Than good, in all the Bible and Saints Lives. Who drew the Lion vanquish'd? 'Twas a Man. But could we Women write as Scholars can, Men should stand mark'd with far more Wickedness, Than all the Sons of Adam could redress. Love seldom haunts the Breast where Learning lies, And Venus sets e're Mercury can rise. Those play the Scholars who can't play the Men, And use that Weapon which they have, their Pen; When old, and past the Relish of Delight, Then down they sit, and in their Dotage write, That not one Woman keeps her Marriage-Vow. (This by the way, but to my Purpose now.) It chanc'd, my Husband, on a Winter's Night, Read in this Book aloud, with strange Delight, How the first Female (as the Scriptures show) Brought her own Spouse and all his Race to Woe; How Sampson fell; and he whom Dejanire Wrapp'd in th' invenom'd Shirt, and set on fire; How curs'd Eryphile her Lord betray'd, And the dire Ambush Clytemnestra laid. But what most pleas'd him, was the Cretan Dame, And Husband-Bull—oh monstrous! fie for shame! He had by heart the whole Detail of Woe Xantippe made her good Man undergo. How oft' she scolded in a Day, he knew, How many Piss-pots on the Sage she threw; Who took it patiently, and wip'd his Head; Rain follows Thunder, that was all he said. He read, how Arius to his Friend complain'd, A fatal Tree was growing in his Land, On which three Wives successively had twin'd A sliding Noose, and waver'd in the Wind. “Where grows this Plant (reply'd the Friend) oh where? “For better Fruit did never Orchard bear: “Give me some Slip of this most blissful Tree, “And in my Garden planted shall it be.” Then how two Wives their Lord's Destruction prove, Thro' Hatred one, and one thro' too much Love; That for her Husband mix'd a pois'nous Draught, And This, for Lust an am'rous Philtre bought; The nimble Juice soon seiz'd his giddy Head, Frantick at Night, and in the Morning dead. How some with Swords their sleeping Lords have slain, And some have hammer'd Nails into their Brain; And some have drench'd them with a deadly Potion; All this he read, and read with great Devotion. Long time I heard, and swell'd, and blush'd, and frown'd; But when no End of these vile Tales I found, When still he read, and laugh'd, and read again, And half the Night was thus consum'd in vain; Provok'd to Vengeance, three large Leaves I tore, And with one Buffet fell'd him on the Floor. With that, my Husband in a Fury rose, And down he settled me with hearty Blows. I groan'd, and lay extended on my Side; ‘Oh! thou hast slain me for my Wealth (I cry'd) ‘Yet I forgive thee—take my last Embrace—’ He wept, kind Soul! and stoop'd to kiss my Face; I took him such a Box as turn'd him blue, Then sigh'd, and cry'd, ‘Adieu, my Dear, adieu!’ But after many a hearty Struggle past, I condescended to be pleas'd at last. Soon as he said, “My Mistress and my Wife, “Do what you list, the Term of all your Life;” I took to Heart the Merits of the Cause, And stood content to rule by wholsome Laws; Receiv'd the Reins of absolute Command, With all the Government of House and Land, And Empire o'er his Tongue, and o'er his Hand. As for the Volume that revil'd the Dames, 'Twas torn to Fragments, and condemn'd to Flames. Now Heav'n on all my Husbands gone, bestow Pleasures above, for Tortures felt below: That Rest, they wish'd for, grant them in the Grave, And bless those Souls my Conduct help'd to save. Continu'd by Mr. Ogle.The Point thus settled, from Objection clear, Now will I tell my Tale, if you will hear. Here, interrupting, laugh'd the rosy Fry'r; “So may my Soul to Heav'nly Bliss aspire, “Nor yet of Earthly Good my Body fail, “As 'twas a long Preamble of a Tale.” He said, and chuckled at his Speech so smart. This heard the Sumner, nettled to the Heart, Mad to observe his Brother Leech in Glee; For rarely two of any Trade agree. “Now, by the Arms that hung our Souls to save, “A Fry'r is still an intermeddling Knave: “For, like a Fly, he falls in ev'ry Dish, “Be it or Roast, or Boil'd, or Fowl, or Fish: “Why stop the Lady in her pleasant Gambole? “And what to thee the Length of her Preamble? “Keep on the Right, or Left, behind, before, “Peace, Son of a Mendicant! Peace, Son of a Whore!” “So! (quoth the Fry'r) Sir Sumner, say'st thou so? “Faith, we will state Accounts e're far we go. “I of a Sumner will a Tale provide, “And ev'ry Hand shall shake at ev'ry Side.” The Sumner answer'd, “I beshrew thy Face. “Of many a Fry'r can I recount the Case; “And one shall pay thy Malice in Return, “E're yet we reach the Town of Sittingbourne.” “Hold (cry'd our Lordly Host) you spoil our Sport; “Silence, I say; keep Silence in the Court! “Will you not let the Woman tell her Tale? “Wrangling, like Gossips, drunk with Market-Ale! “Come, gentle Dame, our Play is at a stand.”— ‘All ready, Sir, quoth she, at your Command. ‘I'll do the best to please you that I can, ‘If I have Licence from this worthy Man.’ “'Tis granted, said the Fry'r, with holy Leer, “And open'd to the Tale a self-sufficient Ear.” END of the Prologue. THE Desire of Woman: OR, THE Wife of BATH's TALE. By Mr. Dryden. In Days of Old, when Arthur fill'd the Throne, Whose Acts and Fame to Foreign Lands were blown; The little Elfs and little Fairy Queen Gambol'd on Heaths, and danc'd along the Green; And where the jolly Troop had led the Round, The Grass untrodden rose, and mark'd the Ground: Nor darkling did they glance, the Silver Light Of Phœbe serv'd to guide their Steps aright, And, with their Tripping pleas'd, prolong the Night. Her Beams they follow'd, where at full they play'd, Nor longer than she shed her Horns they stay'd: From thence with airy Flight to Foreign Lands convey'd. Above the rest, our Britain held they dear, More solemnly they kept their Sabbaths here, And made more spacious Rings, and revel'd half the Year. I speak of ancient Times; for now the Swain Returning late may pass the Woods in vain, And never hope to see the nightly Train: In vain the Dairy now with Mints is drest, The Dairy-Maid expects no Fairy-Guest To skim the Bowls, and after pay the Feast. She sighs, and shakes her empty Shoes in vain, No Silver-Penny to reward her Pain: For Priests with Pray'rs, and other Godly Geer, Have made the merry Goblins disappear; And where they play'd their merry Pranks before, Have sprinkled Holy Water on the Floor: And Fry'rs, that thro' the wealthy Regions run Thick as the Motes that twinkle in the Sun, Resort to Farmers rich, and bless their Halls, And exorcise the Beds, and cross the Walls: This makes the Fairy Choirs forsake the Place, When once 'tis hallow'd with the Rites of Grace: But in the Walks where wicked Elves have been, The Learning of the Parish now is seen, The Midnight Parson posting o'er the Green, With Gown tuck'd up to Wakes; for Sunday next, With humming Ale encouraging his Text; Nor wants the holy Leer to Country-Girl betwixt. From Fiends and Imps he sets the Village free, There haunts not any Incubus but He. The Maids and Women need no Danger fear To walk by Night, and Sanctity so near: For by some Hay-cock, or some shady Thorn, He bids his Beads both Even-song and Morn. It so befel in this King Arthur's Reign, A lusty Knight was pricking o'er the Plain; A Bachelor he was, and of the Courtly Train. It happen'd as he rode, a Damsel gay In Russet Robes to Market took her Way; Soon on the Girl he cast an am'rous Eye, So straight she walk'd, and on her Pasterns high: If seeing her behind he lik'd her Pace, Now turning short, he better lik'd her Face: He 'lights in haste, and, full of youthful Fire, By Force accomplish'd his obscene Desire: This done, away he rode, not unespy'd, For swarming at his Back the Country cry'd; And, once in View, they never lost the Sight, But seiz'd, and pinion'd brought to Court the Knight. Then Courts of Kings were held in high Renown, E're made the common Brothels of the Town: There, Virgins honourable Vows receiv'd, But chaste as Maids in Monasteries liv'd: The King himself, to nuptial Ties a Slave, No bad Example to his Poets gave: And they not bad, but in a vicious Age, Had not, to please the Prince, debauch'd the Stage. Now what should Arthur do? He lov'd the Knight; But Sov'reign Monarchs are the Source of Right: Mov'd by the Damsel's Tears and common Cry, He doom'd the brutal Ravisher to die. But fair Geneura rose in his Defence, And pray'd so hard for Mercy from the Prince, That to his Queen the King th' Offender gave, And left it in her Pow'r to Kill or Save. This gracious Act the Ladies all approve, Who thought it much, a Man should die for Love; And with their Mistress join'd in close Debate, (Cov'ring their Kindness with dissembled Hate,) If not to free him, to prolong his Fate. At last agreed, they call'd him by Consent Before the Queen and Female Parliament: And the fair Speaker rising from her Chair, Did thus the Judgment of the House declare: ‘Sir Knight, tho' I have ask'd thy Life, yet still ‘Thy Destiny depends upon my Will: ‘Nor hast thou other Surety than the Grace ‘Not due to thee from our offended Race. ‘But as our Kind is of a softer Mold, ‘And cannot Blood without a Sigh behold, ‘I grant thee Life; reserving still the Pow'r ‘To take the Forfeit when I see my Hour; ‘Unless thy Answer to my next Demand ‘Shall set Thee free from our avenging Hand: ‘The Question, whose Solution I require, ‘Is, What the Sex of Women most desire? ‘In this Dispute thy Judges are at Strife: ‘Beware; for on thy Wit depends thy Life, ‘Yet (lest surpriz'd, unknowing what to say, ‘Thou damn thy self) we give thee farther Day: ‘A Year is thine, to wander at thy Will, ‘And learn from others, if thou want'st the Skill. ‘But, not to hold our Proffer turn'd in Scorn, ‘Good Sureties will we have for thy Return; ‘That at the Time prefix'd thou shalt obey, ‘And at thy Pledges Peril keep thy Day.’ Woe was the Knight at this severe Command! But well he knew 'twas bootless to withstand: The Terms accepted, as the Fair ordain, He put in Bail for his Return again; And promis'd Answer at the Day assign'd, The best, with Heav'n's Assistance, he could find. His Leave thus taken, on his Way he went With heavy Heart, and full of Discontent, Misdoubting much, and fearful of th' Event, 'Twas hard the Truth of such a Point to find, As was not yet agreed among the Kind. Thus on he went; still anxious more and more, Ask'd all he met, and knock'd at ev'ry Door; Enquir'd of Men; but made his chief Request To learn from Women what they lov'd the best. They answer'd each according to her Mind, To please herself, not all the Female Kind. One was for Wealth, another was for Place: Crones, old and ugly, wish'd a better Face, The Widow's Wish was, oftentimes to wed; The wanton Maids were all for Sport a-Bed. Some said, the Sex were pleas'd with handsome Lies, And some gross Flatt'ry lov'd without Disguise: Truth is, says one, he seldom fails to win, Who flatters well; for that's our darling Sin. But long Attendance, and a duteous Mind, Will work ev'n with the Wisest of our Kind. One thought the Sexes prime Felicity Was from the Bonds of Wedlock to be free: Their Pleasures, Hours, and Actions all their own, And uncontroll'd to give Account to none. Some wish a Husband-Fool; but such are curst, For Fools perverse, of Husbands are the worst: All Women would be counted Chaste and Wise; Nor should our Spouses see, but with our Eyes: For Fools with prate; and tho' they want the Wit To find close Faults, yet open Blots will hit: Tho' better for their Ease to hold their Tongue, For Womankind was never in the Wrong. So Noise ensues, and Quarrels last for Life; The Wife abhors the Fool, the Fool the Wife. And some Men say, that great Delight have we To be for Truth extoll'd, and Secrecy; And constant in one Purpose still to dwell, And not our Husband's Counsels to reveal. But that's a Fable; for our Sex is frail, Inventing rather than not tell a Tale. Like leaky Sieves, no Secrets we can hold: Witness the famous Tale that Ovid told. Midas the King, as in his Book appears, By Phœbus was endow'd with Asses Ears, Which under his long Locks he well conceal'd, (As Monarchs Vices must not be reveal'd) For fear the People have 'em in the Wind, Who long ago were neither Dumb nor Blind; Nor apt to think from Heav'n their Title springs, Since Jove and Mars left off begetting Kings: This Midas knew; and durst communicate To none but to his Wife, his Ears of State. One must be trusted, and he thought her fit, As passing prudent, and a parlous Wit. To this sagacious Confessor he went, And told her what a Gift the Gods had sent; But told it under Matrimonial Seal, With strict Injunction never to reveal. The Secret heard, she plighted him her Troth (And sacred, sure, is ev'ry Woman's Oath) The Royal Malady should rest unknown, Both for her Husband's Honour and her own: But ne'ertheless she pin'd with Discontent; The Counsel rumbled till it found a Vent. The Thing, she knew, she was oblig'd to hide; By Int'rest and by Oath the Wife was ty'd; But if she told it not, the Woman dy'd. Loth to betray a Husband and a Prince, But she must burst, or blab; and no Pretence Of Honour ty'd her Tongue from Self-Defence. A marshy Ground commodiously was near; Thither she ran, and held her Breath for fear, Lest if a Word she spoke of any thing, That Word might be the Secret of the King. Thus, full of Counsel, to the Fen she went, Grip'd all the Way, and longing for a Vent: Arriv'd, by pure Necessity compell'd, On her majestic Marrow-bones she kneel'd; Then to the Waters-brink she laid her Head, And, as a Bittour bumps within a Reed, ‘To thee alone, O Lake, she said, I tell ‘(And, as thy Queen, command thee to conceal) ‘Beneath his Locks the King my Husband wears ‘A goodly Royal Pair of Asses Ears. ‘Now I have eas'd my Bosom of the Pain, ‘Till the next longing Fit returns again!’ Thus thro' a Woman was the Secret known; Tell us, and in Effect you tell the Town. But, to my Tale: The Knight with heavy Cheer, Wandring in vain, had now consum'd the Year: One Day was only left to solve the Doubt; Yet knew no more than when he first set out. But home he must; and as th' Award had been, Yield up his Body Captive to the Queen. In this despairing State he happ'd to ride, As Fortune led him, by a Forest-side: Lonely the Vale, and full of Horror stood, Brown with the Shade of a religious Wood: When full before him, at the Noon of Night, (The Moon was up, and shot a gleamy Light) He saw a Choir of Ladies in a Round, That featly footing seem'd to skim the Ground: Thus dancing Hand in Hand, so light they were, He knew not where they trod, on Earth or Air. At speed he drove, and came a sudden Guest, In hope where many Women were, at least Some one by chance might answer his Request. But faster than his Horse the Ladies flew, And in a trice were vanish'd out of View. One only Hag remain'd; but fouler far Than Grandame Apes in Indian Forests are; Against a wither'd Oak she lean'd her Weight, Propp'd on her trusty Staff, not half upright, And dropp'd an aukward Court'sy to the Knight. Then said, “What makes you, Sir, so late abroad “Without a Guide, and this no beaten Road? “Or want you aught that here you hope to find, “Or travel for some Trouble in your Mind? “The last I guess; and, if I read aright, “Those of our Sex are bound to serve a Knight: “Perhaps good Counsel may your Grief assuage; “Then tell your Pain: For Wisdom is in Age. To this the Knight: ‘Good Mother, would you know ‘The secret Cause and Spring of all my Woe? ‘My Life must with To-morrow's Light expire, ‘Unless I tell what Women most desire. ‘Now, could you help me at this hard Essay, ‘Or for your inborn Goodness, or for Pay; ‘Yours is my Life, redeem'd by your Advice, ‘Ask what you please, and I will pay the Price: ‘The proudest Kerchief of the Court shall rest ‘Well satisfy'd of what they love the best.’ “Plight me thy Faith, quoth she, that what I ask, “Thy Danger over, and perform'd the Task; “That shalt thou give for Hire of thy Demand; “Here, take thy Oath, and seal it on my Hand; “I warrant thee, on Peril of my Life, “Thy Word shall please both Widow, Maid, and Wife. More Words there needed not to move the Knight To take her Offer, and his Truth to plight. With that she spread her Mantle on the Ground, And, first enquiring whither he was bound, Bid him not fear, tho' long and rough the Way, At Court he should arrive e're Break of Day: His Horse should find the Way without a Guide, She said: With Fury they began to ride, He on the midst, the Beldam at his Side. The Horse, what Devil drove I cannot tell; But only this, they sped their Journey well: And all the Way the Crone inform'd the Knight, How he should answer the Demand aright. To Court they came: The News was quickly spread; Of his returning to redeem his Head. The Female Senate was assembled soon, With all the Mob of Women in the Town: The Queen sate Lord Chief Justice of the Hall, And bade the Crier cite the Criminal. The Knight appear'd, and Silence they proclaim, Then first the Culprit answer'd to his Name: And, after Forms of Law, was last requir'd To name the Thing that Women most desir'd. Th' Offender, taught his Lesson by the Way, And by his Counsel order'd what to say, Thus bold began: “My Lady Liege (said he) “What all your Sex desire, is Sov'reignty. “The Wife affects her Husband to command; “All must be hers, both Money, House and Land. “The Maids are Mistresses ev'n in their Name; “And of their Servants full Dominion claim. “This, at the Peril of my Head, I say, “A blunt plain Truth, The Sex aspires to Sway, “You to rule all, while we, like Slaves, obey.” There was not one, or Widow, Maid, or Wife, But said, the Knight had well deserv'd his Life. Ev'n fair Geneura, with a Blush, confess'd The Man had found what Women love the best. Up starts the Beldam, who was there unseen, And, Rev'rence made, accosted thus the Queen: ‘My Liege, said she, before the Court arise, ‘May I, poor Wretch, find Favour in your Eyes. ‘To grant my just Request? 'Twas I who taught ‘The Knight this Answer, and inspir'd his Thought. ‘None but a Woman could a Man direct ‘To tell us Women, what we most affect. ‘But first I swore him on his Knightly Troth, ‘(And here demand Performance of his Oath) ‘To grant the Boon that next I should desire: ‘He gave his Faith, and I expect my Hire: ‘My Promise is fulfill'd: I sav'd his Life, ‘And claim his Debt, to take me for his Wife.’ The Knight was ask'd, nor could his Oath deny, But hop'd they would not force him to comply. The Women, who would rather wrest the Laws, Than let a Sister-Plaintiff lose the Cause, (As Judges on the Bench more gracious are, And more attent to Brothers of the Bar) Cry'd one and all, the Suppliant should have Right, And to the Grandame-Hag adjudg'd the Knight. In vain he sigh'd, and oft' with Tears desir'd Some reasonable Sute might be requir'd. But still the Crone was constant to her Note; The more he spoke, the more she stretch'd her Throat. In vain he proffer'd all his Goods, to save His Body, destin'd to that living Grave. The liqu'rish Hag rejects the Pelf with Scorn: And nothing but the Man would serve her Turn. ‘Not all the Wealth of Eastern Kings, said she, ‘Have Pow'r to part my plighted Love and me: ‘And Old, and Ugly as I am, and Poor, ‘Yet never will I break the Faith I swore! ‘For mine thou art by Promise, during Life, ‘And I thy loving and obedient Wife.’ “My Love! Nay, rather my Damnation Thou, “Said he; nor am I bound to keep my Vow: “The Fiend, thy Sire, has sent thee from below, “Else how could'st thou my secret Sorrows know? “Avant, old Witch; for I renounce thy Bed: “The Queen may take the Forfeit of my Head, “E're any of my Race so foul a Crone shall wed. Both heard, the Judge pronounc'd against the Knight, So was he marry'd in his own despite: And all Day after hid him as an Owl, Not able to sustain a Sight so foul. Perhaps the Reader thinks I do him Wrong, To pass the Marriage-Feast and Nuptial Song: Mirth there was none, the Man was a-la-mort, And little Courage had to make his Court. To Bed they went, the Bridegroom and the Bride: Was never such an ill-pair'd Couple ty'd. Restless, he toss'd and tumbled to and fro, And roll'd and wriggled further off for Woe. The good old Wife lay smiling by his Side, And caught him in her quiv'ring Arms, and cry'd, ‘When you my ravish'd Predecessor saw, ‘You were not then become this Man of Straw; ‘Had you been such, you might have 'scap'd the Law. ‘Is this the Custom of King Arthur's Court? ‘Are all Round-Table Knights of such a Sort? ‘Remember I am she who sav'd your Life, ‘Your loving, lawful, and complying Wife: ‘Not thus you swore in your unhappy Hour, ‘Nor I for this Return employ'd my Pow'r. ‘In time of Need I was your faithful Friend; ‘Nor did I since, nor ever will offend. ‘Believe me, my lov'd Lord, 'tis much unkind; ‘What Fury has possess'd your alter'd Mind? ‘Thus on my Wedding-Night—without Pretence— ‘Come, turn this Way, or tell me my Offence. ‘If not your Wife, let Reason's Rule persuade; ‘Name but my Fault, Amends shall soon be made. “Amends! Nay, that's impossible, said he; “What Change of Age or Ugliness can be? “Or, could Medea's Magick mend thy Face, “Thou art descended from so mean a Race, “That never Knight was match'd with such Disgrace. “What Wonder, Madam, if I move my Side, “When, if I turn, I turn to such a Bride?” ‘And is this all that troubles you so sore? “And, what the Devil could'st thou wish me more?’ ‘Ah, Benedicite! reply'd the Crone: ‘Then Cause of just Complaining you have none. ‘The Remedy to this were soon apply'd, ‘Wou'd you be like the Bridegroom to the Bride. ‘But (for you say, a long-descended Race, ‘And Wealth and Dignity, and Pow'r and Place, ‘Make Gentlemen, and that your high Degree ‘Is much disparag'd to be match'd with me;) ‘Know this, my Lord, Nobility of Blood ‘Is but a glitt'ring and fallacious Good: ‘The Nobleman is he, whose noble Mind ‘Is fill'd with inborn Worth, unborrow'd from his Kind. ‘The King of Heav'n was in a Manger laid, ‘And took his Earth but from an humble Maid; ‘Then what can Birth, or mortal Men bestow? ‘Since Floods no higher than their Fountains flow. ‘We, who for Name and empty Honour strive, ‘Our true Nobility from him derive. ‘Your Ancestors, who puff your Mind with Pride, ‘And vast Estates to mighty Titles ty'd, ‘Did not your Honour, but their own advance; ‘For Virtue comes not by Inheritance. ‘If you tralineate from your Father's Mind, ‘What are you else but of a Bastard-kind? ‘Do as your great Progenitors have done, ‘And by your Virtues prove yourself their Son. ‘No Father can infuse, or Wit or Grace; ‘A Mother comes across, and marrs the Race. ‘A Grandsire or a Grandame taints the Blood; ‘And seldom three Descents continue Good. ‘Were Virtue by Descent, a noble Name ‘Could never villanize his Father's Fame; ‘But as the first, the last of all the Line ‘Would, like the Sun, ev'n in Descending shine. ‘Take Fire, and bear it to the darkest House ‘Betwixt King Arthur's Court and Caucasus, ‘If you depart, the Flame shall still remain, ‘And the bright Blaze enlighten all the Plain: ‘Nor, till the Fuel perish, can decay, ‘By Nature form'd on Things combustible to prey. ‘Such is not Man, who mixing better Seed ‘With worse, begets a base degen'rate Breed: ‘The Bad corrupts the Good, and leaves behind ‘No Trace of all the great Begetter's Mind. ‘The Father sinks within his Son, we see, ‘And often rises in the third Degree: ‘If better Luck a better Mother give; ‘Chance gave us Being, and by Chance we live. ‘Such as our Atoms were, ev'n such are we, ‘Or call it Chance, or strong Necessity, ‘Thus, loaded with dead Weight, the Will is free. ‘And thus it needs must be: For Seed conjoin'd ‘Lets into Nature's Work th' imperfect Kind: ‘But Fire, th' Enliv'ner of the gen'ral Frame, ‘Is One, its Operations still the same. ‘Its Principle is in itself: While ours ‘Works, as Confed'rates war, with mingled Pow'rs: ‘Or Man, or Woman, whichsoever fails: ‘And, oft', the Vigour of the worse prevails. ‘Æther with Sulphur blended alters Hue, ‘And casts a dusky Gleam of Sodom blue. ‘Thus in a Brute, their ancient Honour ends, ‘And the fair Mermaid in a Fish descends: ‘The Line is gone; no longer Duke or Earl; ‘But, by himself degraded, turns a Churl. ‘Nobility of Blood is but Renown ‘Of thy great Fathers, by their Virtue known, ‘And a long Trail of Light to thee descending down. ‘If in thy Smoke it ends, their Glories shine; ‘But Infamy and Villanage are thine. ‘Then what I said before is plainly show'd, ‘The true Nobility proceeds from God: ‘Not left us by Inheritance, but giv'n ‘By Bounty of our Stars, and Grace of Heav'n. ‘Thus from a Captive Servius Tullus rose, ‘Whom for his Virtues the first Romans chose: ‘Fabritius from their Walls repell'd the Foe, ‘Whose noble Hands had exercis'd the Plough. ‘From hence, my Lord and Love, I thus conclude, ‘That tho' my homely Ancestors were rude, ‘Mean as I am, yet I may have the Grace ‘To make you Father of a gen'rous Race: ‘And Noble then am I, when I begin, ‘In Virtue cloth'd, to cast the Rags of Sin: ‘If Poverty be my upbraided Crime, ‘And you believe in Heav'n, there was a time ‘When He, the great Controller of our Fate, ‘Deign'd to be Man, and liv'd in low Estate: ‘Which he, who had the World at his Dispose, ‘If Poverty were Vice, would never choose. ‘Philosophers have said, and Poets sing, ‘That a glad Poverty's an honest Thing. ‘Content is Wealth, the Riches of the Mind; ‘And happy He who can that Treasure find. ‘But the base Miser starves amidst his Store, ‘Broods on his Gold, and griping still at more, ‘Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor. ‘The ragged Beggar, tho' he wants Relief, ‘Has not to lose, and sings before the Thief. ‘Want is a bitter and a hateful Good, ‘Because its Virtues are not understood: ‘Yet many Things, impossible to Thought, ‘Have been by Need to full Perfection brought: ‘The Daring of the Soul proceeds from thence, ‘Sharpness of Wit, and active Diligence: ‘Prudence at once, and Fortitude it gives, ‘And, if in Patience ta'en, it mends our Lives: ‘For ev'n that Indigence that brings me low, ‘Makes me Myself, and Him above to know. ‘A Good which none would challenge, few would choose; ‘A fair Possession, which Mankind refuse, ‘If we from Wealth to Poverty descend, ‘Want gives to know the Flatt'rer from the Friend. ‘If I am Old and Ugly, well for you; ‘No lewd Adult'rer will my Love pursue. ‘Nor Jealousy, the Bane of Marry'd Life, ‘Shall haunt you, for a wither'd homely Wife: ‘For Age and Ugliness, as all agree, ‘Are the best Guards of Female Chastity. ‘Yet, since I see your Mind is worldly bent, ‘I'll do my best to further your Content. ‘And therefore, of two Gifts in my Dispose, ‘Think e're you speak, I grant you Leave to choose: ‘Would you I should be still Deform'd and Old, ‘Nauseous to touch, and loathsom to behold; ‘On this Condition, to remain for Life ‘A careful, tender, and obedient Wife, ‘In all I can contribute to your Ease, ‘And not in Deed, or Word, or Thought displease? ‘Or, would you rather have me Young and Fair, ‘And take the Chance that happens to your Share? ‘Temptations are in Beauty, and in Youth; ‘And how can you depend upon my Truth? ‘Now weigh the Danger with the doubtful Bliss, ‘And thank yourself, if aught should fall amiss.’ Sore sigh'd the Knight, who this long Sermon heard: At length, consid'ring all, his Heart he chear'd; And thus reply'd: “My Lady, and my Wife, “To your wise Conduct I resign my Life: “Choose you for me; for well you understand “The future Good and Ill on either Hand: “But, if an humble Husband may request, “Provide, and order all Things for the best: “Yours be the Care to profit, and to please; “And let your Subject-Servant take his Ease.” ‘Then thus in Peace, quoth she, concludes the Strife, ‘Since I am turn'd the Husband, you the Wife: ‘The Matrimonial Victory is mine; ‘Which, having fairly gain'd, I will resign. ‘Forgive, if I have said or done amiss, ‘And seal the Bargain with a friendly Kiss: ‘I promis'd you but one Content to share; ‘But now I will become both Good and Fair. ‘No nuptial Quarrel shall disturb your Ease, ‘The Bus'ness of my Life shall be to please. ‘And for my Beauty, that as Time shall try; ‘But draw the Curtain first, and cast your Eye.’ He look'd, and saw a Creature heav'nly fair, In Bloom of Youth, and of a charming Air. With Joy he turn'd, and seiz'd her Iv'ry Arm; And, like Pygmalion, found the Statue warm. Small Arguments there needed to prevail, A Storm of Kisses pour'd as thick as Hail. Thus, long in mutual Bliss they lay embrac'd, And their first Love continu'd to the last: One Sunshine was their Life; no Cloud between; Nor ever was a kinder Couple seen. And so may all our Lives like theirs be led; Heav'n send the Maids young Husbands, fresh in Bed. May Widows wed as often as they can, And ever for the better change their Man. And some devouring Plague pursue their Lives, Who will not well be govern'd by their Wives. END of the Wife of BATH's TALE. PROLOGUE TO THE FRYAR's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. Full, on the Sumner, lour'd the Licenc'd Fry'r, And, suffocating, boil'd and burn'd with Ire. Yet, caution'd by our Host, nor Rule he broke, Nor, till the Dame had finish'd, Word he spoke. Then threw he, as he thought, a lucky Hit; For, of his House, he was a parlous Wit. “Dame, you have led, (quoth He) a merry Life; “Happy the Man, that marries such a Wife! “Wedlock's a knotty Point, I must declare; “But you have touch'd it to a single Hair: “And, may I die, tho' canvass'd in the Schools, “'Twas never settled yet by juster Rules. “Here let me only tell you, by the way, “Tho' right in most that you was pleas'd to say, “Yet in your free Citations you are wrong; “'Tis little less than Petulance of Tongue. “Beneath your Feet be the Sixth Husband trod; “But use with due Respect the Word of God. “'Tis what no Layman should presume to name: “But, for a Woman—Madam, fye, for Shame! “Texts and Authorities are sacred Mines: “Leave Quoting Scripture, to Us sound Divines. “Ev'n I myself a Sumner's Story chuse, “Not aiming to instruct you, but amuse. “Nam'd I a Sumner? be it understood, “I mean not, of the Man, to say much Good: “Like Tyburn-Jack, you know him by his Station: “A Sumner is a Bawd for Fornication!” ‘Hold! said our Host, a Churchman should be meek; ‘A Christian you! and with such Rancour speak? ‘Be courteous, humble, as becomes a Priest; ‘Abuse no Friend in Company at least. ‘This the Forbearance of a Fry'r profess'd? ‘Tell on your Tale, and let the Sumner rest.’ “Nay, quoth the Sumner, give him Length of Rope, “Pardie! my Staff shall tally with his Cope! “For I will bring a Licens'd Fry'r to View, “A Pattern He, of all the Fawning Crew. “The Merit of their Function I will show, “And where they hold their Office, all shall know.” ‘No more of this, our Host in Fury cry'd: ‘Begin, I say, Sir Fry'r!’ The Fry'r comply'd. END of the Prologue. THE Sumner and the Devil: OR, THE FRYAR's TALE. By Mr. MARKLAND. A rigorous Arch-Deacon whilom liv'd, From whom severest Justice Guilt receiv'd; Him no Evasions ever could elude; Offending Sinners strictly he pursu'd. But Fornicators were in greatest Awe: On them he always put the Penal Law. And they whose Tythes were slow of Coming-in, (To cheat the Clergy is a crying Sin!) Them oft with Mulcts pecun'ary he fin'd, Nor let them cheat the Church, howe'er inclin'd. For e're the Bishop caught them with his Hook, They were first enter'd in th' Arch-Deacon's Book. He had a Sumner, bred to pious Guiles, To Fraud, and true Ecclesiastick Wiles; To none in Craft inferior; none so fit To burlesque Virtue, by defending it. Immoral Actions slily could he trace Thro' ev'ry Path of the Dissembler's Maze. One or two Leachers He would gently use, If they as many Dozen would accuse: Whene'er a Criminal impeach'd did stand, Pimps, Bawds, and sly Informers were at hand: Whate'er was urg'd, or Right, or Wrong, they swore, And, Conscience-proof, false Witness gladly bore. They gave him Informations, not a few, Some of imaginary Crimes, some true. And new-reviv'd the Devil's Part of old, First tempted Wretches to offend, then sold. For his Advantage they took mighty Pains, And shar'd some little Portion of his Gains. His Master thought he most uprightly liv'd, Nor ever found wherein he was deceiv'd. Oft' would he issue Summons without Leave, And ample Bribes, to drop the Cause, receive. For when Men stand in danger of a Curse, Who, to preserve his Soul, would grudge his Purse? Thus run he on, intrepid in Deceit, Nor fear'd to be detected of the Cheat. He was (to give him his undoubted Laud) A downright Thief, a Sumner, and a Bawd. Right true-bred Whores he always kept in Pay, Who slily told if any went astray. No sooner did he know th' Offender's Name, But out a forg'd Mandamus quickly came: For diff'rent Ends the guilty Two appear; Her, her own Profit brings; Him, conscious Fear. Th' Event, as he design'd, was still the same, The Man to pill, but to excuse the Dame. Then smoothly would he cry, “Your honest Look “Prevails; I'll cross you in th' Arch-deacon's Book, “Henceforth beware, and never more offend; “Believe me, much I hazard for my Friend.” Thus gravely poor Delinquent would he fright, Till a sufficient Bribe set all things right. Thus did his Whores his heedless Neighbours treat, Giving sour Sauce—whatever was the Meat. It so befel, that on a certain Day, This Sumner, ever waiting for his Prey, Tow'rds a poor Widow's, with a Summons went; Whate'er the Cause, a Bribe was the Intent. And riding gently by a Forest-side, A jolly Yeoman he before him spy'd, Whose dapple Grey in haughty manner pranc'd, And to the Musick of his own Hoofs danc'd. The Sumner kindly hail'd; He gently smil'd, And greeted him with Salutation mild. The Yeoman ask'd, “Proceed you far to day?” ‘No, said the Sumner, but a little Way: ‘At a small Distance hence, is my Intent, ‘To gather for my Lord a little Rent.’ “Are you a Steward then?” the Yeoman said: He answ'ring, ‘Yes,’ conceal'd his proper Trade: He was a little modest; and, for Shame, Would not profess th' unreputable Name. “A Steward! said the Yeoman; Let us greet, “I'm over-joy'd a Brother here to meet: “For I'm a Steward too, no less than Thou, “Tho' in this Country unacquainted now. “Howe'er, I hope, we shall familiar grow, “When we each other somewhat better know. “Then, prithee, mutual Friendship let us swear, “Silver and Gold I have enough to spare. “And if you hap to come within our Shire, “All shall be thine, right as thou wilt desire.” ‘Done, quoth the Sumner, Brotherhood I swear; ‘Henceforth a mutual Friendship let us bear. ‘And whosoe'er in Love is first remiss, ‘Partake he nought of Heav'n's eternal Bliss.’ Thus travell'd they together, Side by Side, The Sumner pleas'd, the Yeoman satisfy'd. The Sumner next began t'inquire his Name, ‘Whither his Journey tended? Whence he came? ‘And where, said he, may I a Visit pay, ‘If e'er my kinder Fortune lead that way?’ He answer'd, “Brother, hence, far low, I live, “Where I to Friends no cold Reception give. “But of the Road I'll draw you such a Chart, “You shall not miss the Way—e'er we depart. ‘Now, Brother, quoth the Sumner, as we ride, ‘Since in your Honesty I may confide, ‘(Since you're a Steward too) I do beseech, ‘That you some fraudful Arts of Gain would teach. ‘Instruct me to make Profits of my Place, ‘Without unseasonable Checks of Grace. ‘Tell, in mine Office, how I most may win, ‘And spare not, or for Conscience, or for Sin.’ “Troth, Brother dear, I'll tell a faithful Tale; “My Wages, I confess, are strait and small: “My Lord is Careful, Vigilant, and Close; “And Avarice in all his Actions shows; “Therefore I study first for his Content; “Then levy supernumerary Rent. “In short, I chiefly by Extortion live, “And gladly pocket what the Tenants give: “From Year to Year I win all my Expence, “Sometimes by Slight, sometimes by Violence. “I plainly tell my Mind, and nothing spare.” ‘Right so, the Sumner answer'd, I do fare: ‘My Conscience ne'er prohibits me to get; ‘But, Right or Wrong—All's Fish that comes to Net. ‘But for Extortion, I should surely starve, ‘And they deserve no Meat, who cannot carve. ‘Let squeamish Stomachs fly ill-gotten Feasts; ‘Give me the Man, that, what he eats, digests. ‘In short, a thousand Reasons I could give; ‘The mighty Law of Nature bids us live, ‘And all our Means are honest, if we thrive. ‘But little Need requires that I should preach ‘To One, much better qualify'd to teach.’ ‘Well are we met, by holy sweet St. Jame; ‘And, Brother, by your Leave, I crave your Name. “My Name, the Yeoman, smiling, said, I'll tell; “I am a Fiend, my Dwelling is in Hell. “And here I ride about, like you, in Quest, “As you yourself not long ago confess'd. “My Purchase is th' Effect of all my Rent: “And ride not you upon the same Intent? “You seek for Lucre, never caring how: “Just so, with such Design, I travel now.” ‘Ah! bless us! the affrighted Sumner cries, ‘How has your Cloven Foot escap'd my Eyes? ‘Can you thus shrewdly Mortal Actions ape? ‘For You, as well as I, have Human Shape. ‘Or serve you any Form determinate, ‘Whilst you remain in your Infernal State? “No, certainly, he answer'd, we have none; “But at our Pleasure we can take us one. “Or come an Immaterial, seeming Shape; “Appear a Boar, a Lyon, Man, or Ape. “Or like an Angel we can sometimes go: “Nor is it wond'rous if we can do so; “When paltry Jugglers can Mankind deceive, “By Cant assisted, and an open Sleeve. “What Pow'r is his, who, Master of Hell's Tricks, “Can form, on whate'er Shape his Fancy fix?” ‘But, said the Sumner, why do you thus frame ‘So various Forms, nor always use the same?’ “Because, quoth he, our Forms we always make “The ready'st our intended Preys to take. “Nor are we troubled much: The Hope of Gains “Takes off the Weight of our industr'ous Pains. “Sometimes a Glutton-Belly does confine, “Guzzling us up, instead of Vintners Wine; “Till, by excessive Drinking over-charg'd, “The Gorge o'erflows, and we're again enlarg'd. “Those who enjoy us, We by turns entrap, “And many a Drunkard proves the Devil's Chap. “Sometimes, like Ivory, with number'd Spots, “We breed loud Strife amongst contentious Sots; “Or at Groom-Porter's (rattling all the Night) “Brawls, Oaths, and deep-mouth'd Blasphemies excite; “Ruine young 'Squires and Tradesmen in a trice: “Hence Men exclaim, The Devil's in the Dice! “Oft' rule we Statesmen's, oft' Director's Dreams; “Hence Plots, Conspiracies, and South-Sea Schemes. “When hatch'd Rebellions first are set on foot, “And Discontent in Subjects Hearts takes Root, “The Chief, by us beguil'd, destroys their Lives, “And he betrays it first, who first contrives. “Thus we concerted Projects often state, “And spoil a Nation's Views of growing Great. “The greedy Kingdom hugs the airy Cheat, “And the Directors thrive by the Deceit; “Till, having lost the entertaining Hope, “We leave them to the Mercy of a Rope. “Some, not unwisely, have th' Occasion guess'd, “Who, but the Devil, could these Things suggest? “Sometimes expresly Pow'r to us is giv'n, “And we are made the Instruments of Heav'n. “The Body of Afflictions oft' we tempt; “But the immortal Soul is still exempt. “Sometimes by black Despair we try the Soul, “But leave the untouch'd Body healthy, whole. “Then, if our Arts are vig'rously withstood, “Man's former Evils turn to future Good. “The Slaves to Man we oftentimes are made, “As when the great Apostle I obey'd: “Nor dare we their superior Pow'r oppose; “Thus Dunstan took the Devil by the Nose.” ‘But, said the Sumner, do you always thus ‘Make Forms substantial when you visit us?’ “No, no, the Fiend reply'd, sometimes we feign, “And but appear imaginary Men. “As, when thro' clefted Floorings we arise, “And, vanishing, beguile poor Mortals Eyes. “Sometimes from Graves dead Carcasses we hire, “To answer what our Votaries require; “And dark Futurity with Truth foretel, “As formerly the Witch rais'd Samuel; “Yet boldly some aver, it was not He; “But I'll not here enforce Divinity. “Yet Thee with sober Seriousness I warn, “Thou wilt e'er-while have little Cause to learn; “For I have Hopes, my dearest Friend to see, “Where 'twill be needless to inquire of Me. “But let us on: I've travell'd all the Day, “Without the smallest Hopes of any Prey: “If now my Company you will receive, “Forward I'll ride, until your Friend you leave.” ‘Nay, said the Sumner, that shall ne'er betide, ‘My well-try'd Honesty is known full wide: ‘I will preserve my faithful Promise well, ‘Altho' thou wert the Emperor of Hell. ‘Friends we'll continue, as we lately sware, ‘And by Accord our Booty thus we'll share: ‘Content yourself with whatsoe'er you gain, ‘And I'll receive the Product of my Brain. ‘But if one of us should have more than t'other, ‘Let him be true, and part it with his Brother.’ “With all my Heart, the Devil answer'd straight, “Hence quickly; let's pursue our better Fate.” Thus they proceed, till coming near a Town (Plac'd in a miry Valley deeply down) They met a Cart, full heavy charg'd with Hay, The Carter driving thro' a dirty Way. Deep were the Tracks, uneven was the Road, And the tir'd Horses droop'd beneath the Load: The Carter strove, and plentifully smote, ‘What, are you jaded? Stir you not a Foot? ‘The Dev'l himself e'en carry you away; ‘I freely give him Horses, Cart and Hay.’ The Sumner list'ning, to his Friend drew near, And, smiling, told him softly in his Ear, ‘Hearken, my Brother, you have got a Prey; ‘Did you not hear th' unthinking Carter say, ‘He gave 'em you?—Prevent a second Word; ‘No better Prey your Fortune will afford.’ “Nay, quoth the Devil, 'tis not his Intent; “Whate'er he said, far otherwise he meant. “Ask him yourself, if you believe not me; “Or stay a little longer here, and see.” Th' impatient Carter, joining all his Force, With utmost Fury whipp'd the foremost Horse. He stoop'd, and stretch'd, and quickly freed the Cart: ‘Heit! said the Carter, Blessings on thy Heart! ‘Well hast thou drawn, and freed us at a Jerk; ‘Jesu, preserve thee, for thy helpful Work. “Now, said the Devil, credit what I told; “I knew his Words, their Purport would not hold: “Whate'er he spake, he never did design: “Thus Words and Actions very seldom join. “But let us forward towards yonder Plains; “Here we but get our Labour for our Pains.” No sooner past the Town a little Way, The Sumner call'd, ‘My dearest Brother, stay; ‘Here lives a Widow in this little House, ‘Would sooner dye, than give away a Souse. ‘Observe how furiously she'll rant and swear; ‘I'll extort Twelve-pence, tho' I leave her bare. ‘That I've th' Arch-deacon's Summons I'll pretend, ‘Altho' I never knew her once offend: ‘Perhaps you know not how we Sumners thrive; ‘So take Example here how well we live.’ The Sumner loudly rattled at the Door; ‘Come out, old Double-Devil, Bawd and Whore; ‘Come forth, and show yourself, you filthy Beast! ‘What! you're solacing with some pamper'd Priest! “Sweet Sir, reply'd the Widow, what's your Will?” ‘I summon you, he answer'd, by this Bill; ‘On pain of 'curring, for your Disrespect, ‘You must your Sentence of my Lord expect; ‘No fine Excuse will palliate this Neglect. ‘At Nine, to-morrow Morn, precisely come.’ “Now, Lord! (said she) I cannot stir from Home, “Long Sickness has confin'd me to my Room; “I cannot walk, and less indure to ride, “I have such Pains and Pricking in my Side. “May I not ask a Libel in this Case, “And let my Proctor answer in my Place? “It won't be represented as Neglect, “If he may answer what my Foes object.” ‘My Friendship, he reply'd, I'll let you use; ‘For Twelve-pence your Appearance I'll excuse: ‘I would not your Expences should be large, ‘Or let your Fees run up a needless Charge: ‘For Proctors, when they get a Client in, ‘Fleece him to Nakedness, to Bones and Skin: ‘And thro' all Ages this has been confess'd, ‘That Lawyers are but Villains at the best. ‘Therefore, that this Affair no Noise may breed, ‘And save your Money 'gainst the Time of Need, ‘You, for the Sum I mention'd I'll acquit; ‘'Tis more indeed, than e'er I ventur'd yet; ‘And I no more than half the Profit get: ‘One Moiety th' Arch-deacon has for Fees; ‘Disbursing therefore Twelve-pence, be at Ease.’ “Heav'n so protect me from all future Sin, “Said she, if I the Universe should win, “I have not Twelve-pence I can call my own: “Alas! I'm needy, and past Labour grown. “Bestow your Charity on me poor Wretch.” ‘Fruitless, he answer'd, is this thy idle Fetch? ‘I've noted thee, thou old contriving Jilt!’ “Yet, she reply'd, I'm ignorant of Guilt.” ‘Pay me, he loudly cry'd, or by St. Anne, ‘I'll carry off by downright Force your Pan. ‘You were indebted to me long before, ‘For being cited when you play'd the Whore. ‘I kindly paid your Fees, ungrateful Thrash, ‘Or you had smartly undergone the Lash.’ “Thou ly'st (said she) and 'tis a sorry Trick, “To chouse an honest Woman, poor, and sick. “Never was I, whilst Widow, Maid, or Wife, “Summon'd before your Master in my Life. “Nor was I ever known to have the Way “Of using filthy Tricks in filthier Play. “And he that ev'ry Thing doth timely send, “Take thee—and give thee to the foulest Fiend.” Soon as the Fiend her hearty Curses heard, He nearer drew, and asking, thus conferr'd; “Tell me, my dearest Mother, do you joke, “Or is this kindly Wish in earnest spoke?” ‘I speak, said she, with Bitterness of Heart, ‘The Devil take him hence before we part, ‘My Fan and all, except he doth repent.’ ‘Nay, quoth the Sumner, that's not my Intent. ‘This Pan I'll never part with; 'tis my own: ‘Would I possess'd each Rag that thou hast on. ‘Not but, if e'er I apprehended Harm, ‘I would remit your Smock—to keep you warm.’ “Now, said the Devil, Brother, you shall hear; “This Bus'ness I am able best to clear. “Our Bargain was, Each freely should possess “Whate'er was giv'n him; I expect no less: “Your Title to this Pan you must resign; “For by the Owner's Gift 'tis fairly mine. “You'll never part with it;—Your Word's of Force; “Your Body therefore is my own of course. “Besides, I think you equally my Claim, “As being giv'n me by this injur'd Dame. “Her pow'rful Wishes critically fell: “So, faith, Sir Sumner, you may go to Hell.” END of the FRYAR's TALE. PROLOGUE TO THE Sumner's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. Here paus'd the Fry'r, to laugh at his own Wit, As having sent the Sumner down the Pit: “There lies the Heritage of Proctors Civil! “I give thee, Soul and Body, to the Devil! But yet, tho' Priest of Priest has much to say, He judg'd it meet, to trim it with the Lay. And having vented first his Spleen and Spite, Assum'd the Look, forbearing, and contrite! “Repent, ye Sumners! Quit this sinful Road! “Nor make the Fiery Gulph your last Abode! “And oh! preserve us He, from Guides so blind, “Who, after his own Image, form'd Mankind. “For, of that Tribe had I full Room to speak, “Hell would appear the Mansion that they seek. “This could I prove by Texts, one after one, “To Mark from Matthew, and from Luke to John; “And show you, from the very Words of Christ, “That Millions perish, by these Fiends intic'd. “Fathers and Councils, was I here to name, “You'd find no End of everlasting Flame: “For there they draw you by a borrow'd Sign, “Whence Jesus turn you, of his Grace Divine. “Then trust not you to a mis-leading Pow'r, “Who, like the Devil, still watches to devour, “To Sumner, when was high Commission giv'n? “Ev'n He must first confess, to go to Heav'n, “No, would you surely 'scape eternal Fire, “A Fry'r your Intercessor make; a Fry'r! “Take Unction from a Mendicant unshod; “He is the true Ambassador of God.” The Sumner, while the Fry'r his Tale pursu'd, At Heart not easy, view'd him, and review'd. Rais'd on his Horse, and longing to engage, He trembled, like an Aspin-Leaf, with Rage. ‘Now, Sirs (he said) as with the Fry'r you bore, ‘So bear with me, and I will quit the Score. ‘Our good Licentiate talks of Fiends below, ‘As freely as we talk of Friends we know. ‘Nor I, to doubt their Intercourse pretend: ‘For Fiend to Fry'r, is just as Friend to Friend. ‘Who has not heard, how, sleeping in his Cell, ‘A Fry'r was in a Vision rap'd to Hell? ‘Where, as an Angel led him up and down, ‘He look'd, but could not spy one shaven Crown. ‘Numbers of ev'ry Sex and Age he sees, ‘All Ranks and Stations, Functions and Degrees; ‘Ev'n Crowds of old Acquaintance round him came, ‘Full many a topeing Friend, and tickling Dame. “Now, Sir (quoth he) have Fry'rs such gifted Grace, “That none descend to this infernal Place?” “Not so! (the Angel strait the Point explains) “Not so! Here Millions suffer endless Pains. ‘Then, down he led him to th' Abyss profound, ‘Where Satan lay at stretch along the Ground; ‘So broad his Buttock (not to rouse our Tar—) ‘'Twould measure with a First-rate Man of War; ‘And long, as is a Main-Mast, was his Tail, ‘Which, when he cock'd, he look'd a Ship in Sail. “Up, Sirrah (cry'd the Angel) Satan, rise! “Erect thy Tail! shew where the Friery lies! “A Brother craves the Converse of a Brother! “Ope wide, and let him know his nursing Mother: “Thy Nest of Fry'rs, discharge upon the Wing. “Rise up.” ‘And up he rises at a Spring, ‘Erects his Tail, to Pow'r superior, meek, ‘And opes a Gap, as wide as that of Peake. ‘Insu'd a rumbling Sound, and Brimstone-Smell, ‘Then forth they came in Crowds too large to tell, ‘Fry'r urging Fry'r, from out the Devil they drive, ‘As fast as Bees that quit a swarming Hive; ‘Full twenty thousand follow'd ev'ry Blast, ‘And fast as out they came, went in as fast: ‘For Satan roar'd. “Fry'rs, listen to my Call, “Back to your Dormitory, One and All.” “All enter'd, Black, or Brown, or White, or Grey; ‘He clap'd his Tail between, and down he lay. ‘The Fry'r long ruminates the darksome Hole, ‘When, to his Body, God restores his Soul. ‘The Matin-Bell was sounding as he wak'd, ‘While ev'ry Limb with secret Horror quak'd, ‘For once, a true Devout, he left his Bed, ‘So ran the Devil's Posteriors in his Head. ‘Whence Heav'n preserve us all, except the Fry'r; ‘Be that the Lot of ev'ry Convent-Lyar. ‘Nor, Sirs, condemn me, if I turn the Scale: ‘But, as you took my Prologue, take my Tale.’ End of the Prologue. THE Farmer and the Fryar: OR, THE Sumner's TALE. By Mr. BUDGELL. Where Humber's Streams divide the fruitful Plain, There liv'd a Fryar of the Begging Train; Who, licenc'd, hypocritically bold, Would give his Pray'rs, his Mass, his Heav'n for Gold. As once, his Gown high-tuck'd, his Scrip new-hung, Pois'd on his Staff, he pensive trudg'd along; A Door stood ope, where oft the Beechen Bowl, Smiling with Nut-brown Ale, had chear'd his Soul: Gently he tap'd, then cry'd, “May here Content “With Peace for ever dwell!” and in he went. Sick lay the Host; the Fryar growl'd a Pray'r, And with an Ave Mary told his Care. Here down he laid his Staff, there hung his Hat, Brush'd from the Wicker-Chair the Tabby Cat, And with a solemn Leisure down he sat: Then thus began: ‘To-day I preach'd in Town; ‘But kept not servile to the Text alone. ‘Ah! Thomas, had you heard my subtile Wit, ‘My Gloss, my Comments on the Holy Writ; ‘Tho' well, I know, 'gainst Fryars you incline, ‘You'd own that Fryars were of Right Divine.’ The Host reply'd, ‘In Comments I've no Skill; ‘By Comments Priests can prove just what they will. ‘Of Reas'ning deep, some Clerks to shew the Force, ‘From Head to Head drawl out the long Discourse; ‘On this side now, and now on that dispute; ‘Are now confuted, now again confute; ‘Make Saint with Saint, Father with Father vie, ‘Till Glosses prove the Scriptures all a Lie. “Ah! Friend, the Fryar cry'd, youll' nought believe, “But what your simple Reason can conceive: “Laymen must credit, tho' the Doctrine's new; “The Text may vary, but the Comment's true. The Wife tripp'd in, and stopp'd th' haranguing Priest; A Court'sy dropp'd, and welcom'd ev'ry Guest: Slow from the Chair the smiling Fryar rose, And made with aukward Air his solemn Bows: Nor there he stopp'd; but to enlarge his Bliss, Squeez'd her soft Hand, and smack'd a hearty Kiss. “Ah! Friend (quoth he) how happy is thy Life! “Not the whole Town can boast so fair a Wife: “At Church I view'd her, as high Mass was said, “Soft roll'd her Eye, and gently wav'd her Head, “Each Dame was envying, sighing was each Swain, “Whilst she shone fairest of the fairer Train.” The sweetly-simp'ring Dame new Pleasure found, With greedy Ear imbib'd the flatt'ring Sound: Prink'd up her Tucker, ev'ry Charm she try'd, And by her little Arts reveal'd her Pride: Then thus address'd him: ‘Would you taste our Cheer? ‘The Fare is homely, but the Heart sincere! ‘What could you eat, Sir?’—“Nothing (cry'd the Priest) “But a thin Slice of a fat Capon's Breast; “A Brace of Woodcocks, of a Pig the Head, “With a nice Pudding of the whitest Bread: “My squeamish Stomach loaths a sumptuous Treat; “Learn'd Clerks, who study much, but little eat.” Swift tripp'd the Dame away, and seem'd to fly, Brisk as a Colt, and jolly as a Pie. As the Fry'r's Mind on Int'rest chiefly ran, Absent the Wife, he thus accosts the Man: “Is not our Order pious? Ours, which shares “The Day in Fasting, and the Night in Pray'rs? “Than those more pious, whom base Trifles win, “Who hold Pluralities to be no Sin? “For why should Country-Parish claim their Care? “Curates perform the Drudgery of Pray'r. “Tho' their whole Study is t'increase their Store, “They talk fine Things in Praise of being Poor; “With Mock-Humility of Fasting preach; “Tho' their fat Sides deny they practise what they teach. “All Priesthood should be meek; but when there's seen “The rosy Prebend, and the pamper'd Dean, “Stalk to th' expecting Choir with Front elate, “In all the Grandeur of Cathedral State; “There doze in Stalls, or o'er a Sermon nod, “Can we suppose them meek, or thoughtful on their God? “Thus They:—Ah! Thomas, Thomas, by St. Ive, “'Tis from the Fryar's Zeal the Laymen thrive. “Hence, by our Convent's Pray'r, you're blest with Wealth, “Hence, by our Masses you'll regain your Health.” The Churl in Bed reply'd, ‘I have been told, ‘The whole Pursuit of Priesthood is for Gold. ‘Thus some have said; this I myself aver, ‘I'm not a Jot the better for their Pray'r: ‘To Monk, to Fryar, and to Priest I've giv'n; ‘All were Divine Ambassadors from Heav'n. ‘But late, alas! I found this Truth confest, ‘The Man that gives the Least, succeeds the Best.’ “Well, well (reply'd the Priest) appease your Rage, “War with my Patron never will I wage. “Some Fools indeed, will ev'n with Kings contend, “To lash their Vices, or their Morals mend. “I, to reform a Prince, would never arm “My Tongue with Thunder, or with Threats alarm; “Harsh Precepts in a Court can never charm. “There not one Vice I'd lash, nor tedious dwell “On Stings of Conscience, or on Pains of Hell; “But gentle Rules in gentle Words convey, “Till ev'ry conscious Fear in Hope dissolv'd away. “In short, I ne'er with Patrons disagree; “If they're resolv'd for Hell, what's that to me? “But that your Soul to Heav'n may be consign'd, “Confess to me your Crimes, and calm your Mind.” ‘Faith (cry'd the churlish Host), by good St. John, ‘I've once before To-day been shriv'd by one; ‘And once a Day's enough,—“Enough indeed: (The sneering Priest reply'd, more sure to speed;) “Yet to our Convent something you may spare, “And bounteously reward a Fryar's Pray'r: “For should you fail, ah! what I dread to tell, “Saints we must pawn, and Fathers we must sell. “The Layman's lost, if lost that learned Store; “Then Sermons, Comments, Lectures are no more: “In vain you'll wish, you had a Fry'r to preach; “For who, dear Sir, can like a Fryar teach?” He ends: But ah! th' Harangue no Convert gains; Thomas the same gruff churlish Wight remains: So daring impious, that he thought the Fryar A canting Hypocrite, a fawning Liar. Then thus. ‘D'ye think, Sir, that I sure shall speed?’ “Host, I as much believe it as my Creed; “Nay, I am positive, the Fryar cry'd.” Thomas seem'd pleas'd, and with a Smile reply'd, ‘Persuasive are thy Words; while yet I live, ‘In thy own Hand, Sir Fry'r, a Boon I'll give; ‘On this Condition, and on this alone, ‘That the whole Convent equal shares the Boon. ‘This thou shalt swear.’ Eager he plights his Troth, His Mass-Book kiss'd more firm to bind the Oath. Then Thomas: ‘Here, thrust down thy Hand behind; ‘Worthy your Convent, there a Gift you'll find.’ Adown he thrust his Hand into the Clift, And gropes around to find the wish'd-for Gift. Delusive Hope! something too closely pent, Hoarse-rumbling from within demands a Vent: It burst; then dissipated here and there, And fill'd th' expecting Hand with empty Air. Amaz'd, the Fryar started with Surprize, Red glow'd his Cheeks, and ardent flash'd his Eyes: “Is thus, he cry'd, thy Penitence confess'd? “Is this, false Churl, thy Duty to a Priest?” Nor there he'd ended; but, to stop the Fray, Men, Maids, and Wife ran in, and chas'd the Fry'r away. The Priest enrag'd, now meditating Ire, With hasty Pace trudg'd to the neighb'ring Squire, A Quorum Justice of a sober Life, The Parish-Umpire, to compose their Strife. ‘Ah! Benedicite, the Justice cry'd, ‘What Evil could to Fryar John betide?’ John raving, stamp'd, before he Silence broke; At last, with raving Passion thus he spoke: “Divines agree, and Sages have confess'd, “The Church herself is wounded in her Priest.” Again he roar'd. ‘Pray, Sir, your Patience hold, ‘The Justice cry'd, till all your Tale is told.’ The Fry'r the Fact relates, as told before, And as the Story heighten'd, rag'd the more; And ever and anon abruptly mix'd Revenge, Pray'rs, Priests, and Holy Church betwixt. “Sancta Maria! cry'd the Squire's fair Dame; “Is this, Sir Fryar, all the Crime you blame? “In my Opinion, as I hope to speed, “A Churl has only done a churlish Deed.” Not so, the Squire, with sager Wisdom fraught, But gravely paus'd, and seem'd quite lost in Thought; In Mind revolv'd the Statutes o'er and o'er, If ever such a Case occurr'd before: Then thus reply'd: ‘Good Fry'r, that Sound and Air ‘Should be divided in an equal Share ‘Among Thirteen,—No—not the utmost Skill ‘In Euclid's Problems could perform this Will: ‘The Fact, as to a Priest, I own uncivil, ‘The Inspiration of some freakish Devil. ‘Ne'er let the madding Churl perplex thy Soul; ‘Sit down, and drown thy Sorrow in a Bowl. Jenkin, the Clerk, who heard the whole Disaster, And thought he had more Wisdom than his Master, Pertly address'd the Squire—‘Sir, I believe, ‘Would you, and your good Confessor give Leave, ‘I'd shew a Way by which the pious Tribe ‘This comic Gift should equally divide: ‘And tho' I ne'er Euclid's deep Problems knew, ‘You'l all allow, 'tis as an Axiom true. ‘Here, in the Parlour, from the Air close pent, ‘I'd have a Cart-Wheel with twelve Spokes be sent, ‘Which is, save one, the Number of the Tribe, ‘'Mongst whom I equally this Gift divide: ‘Then to each Spoke each lays his rev'rend Beard, ‘Like some wise Seers of Yore, of whom I've heard; ‘Your noble Confessor, whom Heaven save, ‘Shall hold his Nose upright into the Nave; ‘The Churl be brought; and could it hap'ly speed, ‘That he could there repeat his churlish Deed: ‘'Tis Demonstration, that each Spoke around ‘Would equally convey the Air and Sound. ‘Indeed, the Fryar here would first be serv'd;’ ‘But sure, this holy Man has best deserv'd. The Fryar's Frown betray'd his troubled Mind; But Squire and Lady thus in Judgment join'd, With a new Coat that Jenkin should be clad, And that the Churl was neither Fool nor Mad. END of the Sumner's TALE. PROLOGUE TO THE CLERK of Oxford's TALE. By Mr. OGLE. Meantime our Host, the studious Youth survey'd: “You ride as coy and still as any Maid, “That sits, new married, at the Bridal Board: “What! one whole Day, and not one single Word? “With some hard Sophistry, I doubt, You strain, “And a new World of Logic fills your Brain. “But Solomon, in Prose if not in Rhime, “Declares, that All things have their Place and Time. “Sir Clerk of Oxford, brighten up your Face; “To study here, is out of Time and Place. “Who joins in Sport, (no Matter what his Coat, “Or Character of Note, or not of Note,) “Shou'd use his Freedom, or relax his Pride, “And by the Compact, He subscribes, abide. “Then add your Share of Pleasantry and Joke, “And, as becomes a Subject, bear the Yoke. “But preach not You, like starving Fryar in Lent, “Numb'ring our Sins, and Damn, tho' We repent; “Transgressions, with Omissions, old and new: “Then sowse in Hell, without a Heav'n in View! “Nor yet perplex your Text; this Counsel keep “In Mind: For if You nod, We well may sleep! “Tell Us a Tale, but not of Priests or Popes! “And spare your Figures, and forbear your Tropes! “Keep these in Store, to Kings till You indite! “Then, flourish ev'ry Sentence that You write! “Then, stretch your Fancy! Then exalt your Stile! “Here all We ask, is but a Laugh or Smile! “But hold! I bar all Latin, and all Greek! “Speak plain, that We may know what 'tis You Speak!” Mine Host, The worthy Scholar mild reply'd; As free from Bookish Spleen, as Priestly Pride. “I bow beneath the Rod; Allegiance pay; “And, far as Innocence permits, obey. “I but demand free Liberty of Voice; “Light is the Tribute, that is given by Choice. “A Tale I bring, but not from Streets or Stews, “At Padua learnt, and of no Vulgar Muse. “'Tis what Petrarch in Friendly Converse taught, “Petrarch! Who purely wrote, and nobly thought; “Whose Works and Manners, delicate as sage, “Charm'd ev'ry Sex and State, from Youth to Age. “This, shall his Works, to future Times, attest! “His Manners are no more—with Him They rest! “Illustrious Bard, with laurel'd Honours crown'd! “And, were it Just thy boundless Praise to bound, “Thou, Sun of Italy! Whose piercing Light “Dispell'd the Shade! Forebade it to be Night! “Oh! that on Me thy Rays had longer shone! “Too soon Departed! And too lately Known! “Now deep intomb'd the glorious Poet lies; “To Death a Prey!

GUALTHERUS and GRISELDA: OR, THE CLERK of Oxford's TALE. By the same Hand. Down at the Foot of Vesulus the Cold, (Thus ancient Bards the moral Tale unfold) Where first, thro' subterraneous Caverns led, The Springs of Po expand their silver Bed; And, Italy from Italy, divide: There lies a District, on the Western side. Where, rich in Flock and Herd, in Fruit and Grain Abundant, Nature spreads an ample Plain. Here, travel'd Eyes the varied Scene admire, The rounded Turret, and the gradual Spire; From Towns and Castles that aspiring rise, Proud of their wealthy Seats, and claim the Skies. At once for Pleasure and for Plenty fam'd, The Country all around Saluzzo nam'd. A Marquis rul'd this happy Tract of Land; Happy in Him: He rul'd with easy Hand. Full ready were his Subjects to obey The mild Indulgence of his gentle Sway. Obedient to his Will, He govern'd all; Both Orders, the Great Vulgar and the Small. Whether, from Merit due, or lucky Fate; For Worth not always can secure the Great. Well was He Born, his Ancestry to trace, No Lombard Prince cou'd boast a nobler Race. And fair of Face, his Face was fair as young. Tho' strong of Body, delicate tho' strong. Nor was his Beauty to his Form confin'd, His Person was the Image of his Mind. Where Courtesy, alike, and Honor meet. Active, but Wise! Indulgent, but Discreet! In Camp or Council, Equal to preside! Direct in Battle, and in Law decide! In This I blame Gualtherus (Such his Name) In This, and almost This alone, to Blame. But Free from Love, from Error who is Free? (The softer Sex will sure admit the Plea!) Heirs, to support his Name, He never sought, But turn'd to lighter Sport his Daily Thought. He never weigh'd, how early or how late, He sat on Matters that concern'd the State. But Thence releas'd, to Hawk or Hunt prepares; And well nigh quite neglects all better Cares. For Cares, He deem'd the Joys of Married Life. Fall what might fall, He wou'd not take a Wife. This specious Cause new Disaffection draws. And when cou'd Subjects find no specious Cause? (Oft falsely feign'd, but Here sincerely meant!) So, flocking on a Day, to Court They went. And One, in Form, They chose from out the Rest The Common Voice! to utter their Request; Whether, as Wisest, to Themselves prefer'd, Or Dearest to their Lord, and better Heard. “Thrice noble Marquis! (Thus with humble Air, And suppliant Voice, He spoke the Publick Care,) “If thus assur'd We meet that Honor'd Face; “'Tis due to thy Humanity and Grace. “These Princely Qualities our Fears repell; “You prompt to ease our Griefs, as We to tell. “My lowly Pray'r then take not in Disdain; “For Love and Duty force Me to complain. “But why shou'd I my Pray'r, presumptive, call “This universal Suit, the Pray'r of All? “If from my Lips these Words of Licence break, “Thy faithful Subjects dictate what I speak. “Oft have I gain'd before like Audience Here; “Nor wer't Thou wont to give an heedless Ear. “Then let Me still find Favor in thy Sight, “Still, pardon my Request, if not Requite. “While to the Gen'ral Good I point the Way; “And We, but wait your Judgment, to obey. “Such is thy Rule, and such is our Content, “Ought to correct not Envy cou'd invent. “But still forgive, if here with sad Presage “We doubt the equal Bliss of future Age; “And wish those Virtues rare, continued down “To latest Times, that dignify our own. “To serve Thee, in thy Heirs, thy People want; “Nor think this Royal Gift too much to grant. “Then bow thy Neck beneath the Blissfull Yoke; “The Ties of Wedlock are not easy broke: “But Love to Marriage lends a Silken Rein: “Tis not a Servile Bond, but Virtuous Chain. “Then, oh! reflect, (For here the Danger lies!) “Reflect, that Time with hasty Pinions flies, “Time, ever on the Wing, Time stays for none; “Whether We sleep or wake, or stand or run. “Tho' blooming now thy Youth, thy Vigour green; “Age, silent as the Night, creeps on unseen; “And threatens ev'ry Sex, and ev'ry State: “No Pow'r can shun the certain Doom of Fate. “Certain the Doom that He must yield his Breath! “Uncertain yet the Day assign'd by Death. “If Life's a Blessing of so short a Stay; “Judge what yourself must suffer by Delay! “Judge what We suffer! For in this We claim “An equal Int'rest; To preserve your Name! “Preserve your Worth! Here ev'ry Voice conspires, “To leave our Sons as happy as their Sires! “If never yet We disobey'd your Will, “Accept our Offer! Be our Parent still! “Ourselves, to do Thee Fame, will make the Choice; “A worthy Bride, confirm'd by publick Voice! “Such as deriv'd from some exalted Line, “Is fit, and only fit, to match with Thine! “For This, in full Assembly, We appear, “Then pardon our well-meant, tho' needless Fear. “Better declare the Grievance than conceal; “If 'tis a forward, 'tis an honest Zeal. “We fear your ancient Rights (which Heav'n defend!) “May to some new, some foreign Lord descend. Our free but duteous Care, dread Liege, excuse; “What much We value, much We fear to lose. Their honest Plea, in modest Speech addrest, Touch'd with Paternal Care his Gen'rous Breast. By Reason and by Duty, They were mov'd; But more than Life his Liberty He lov'd. That He cou'd ease their Grief, exalts his Mind; The Manner only leaves a Sting behind. A doubtful Course propos'd, thro' which to run, Of Rough and Smooth; a Course he wish'd to shun! At length the Father o'er the Man prevails, And Public Int'rests turn the Private Scales. “Full dear (He said) is future Welfare bought, “Constrain'd to act the Thing I never thought; “Forego my Peace; my Freedom lay aside; “Peace all my Pleasure! Freedom, all my Pride! “Freedom and Peace! In Marriage rarely found! “Then What is to be Wiv'd, but to be Bound? “For Woman is at Best a pleasing Cheat; “Her Look is Counterfeit, Her Heart Deceit. “All She affects, to catch our Ears or Eyes, “Is meer Delusion, Virtue in Disguise. “Nor think I aggravate; when here I view “So Many married, and content so Few. “And Most wou'd own, were but the Truth confest, “That State is an Incumbrance at the Best. “From Infancy the knowing Dame prepares “The Child to lay her Baits, and spread her Snares; “Man is their Prize, and till the Prize They find, “No Fault appears of Body or of Mind. “But say sincerely, You that have been caught, “Which of You boasts a Wife without a Fault? “A Thousand I cou'd count You in a Trice, “Of Folly, Noise, Impertinence, and Vice; “What You may guess, but what I spare to name, “'Tis my Design to reason, not declaim. “Some Failures of each Kind in Men We see; “But in one Failure the whole Sex agree. “In This, They drive at Universal Sway; “Unblest till They command, and We obey. “Wrong I the Sex? By Married Men be try'd “The Cause.” He paus'd for Answer.—None reply'd. “Yet to your Good my Quiet I resign, “And yield my Liberty. Your Good is Mine. “Not born to govern for Myself alone, “I ever held your Int'rest as my own. “Then What You kindly ask, I freely give, “And this the last and surest Proof receive. “This Friend or Foe! This Good or Ill of Life! “This specious Charge! This Doubtful Chance! A Wife! “But for the Choice; Be that our proper Care; “This Mark of Duty and Affection spare. “Nor think It matters Ought, whate'er She be, “Of Rich or Poor, of High or Low Degree; “Ought, to the present or succeeding Age, “What Parents for their Children can ingage? “The Son or well or ill supports his Race, “As Heav'n directs; The Glory or Disgrace! “Nor Vice nor Virtue, rightly understood, “Descend like Titles, running with our Blood. “Was Honor but intail'd upon our Kind, “No well-born Prince cou'd show a slavish Mind. “Nought cou'd the Seeds of Infamy reclaim, “No Vulgar Progeny cou'd rise to Fame. “Yet say what House observes an equal Mean? “Where fix'd was Vice or Virtue ever seen? “View Sire and Son with various Souls indew'd! “The polish'd Sire begets a Son as rude. “Yet oft the Circle ends where It begun, “And the rude Squire begets a polish'd Son. “No Human Care can Destiny controle; “Superior is the Pow'r that guides the Whole. “From Springs unknown are nat'ral Talents giv'n; “Call it the Force of Fate, or Will of Heav'n. “Our Lives are subject to Divine Decrees. “Man only acts as Providence foresees. “Our Part perform'd, let Providence prepare “(Here all Precaution fails!) the Future Heir; “Your Weal or Woe to frustrate or advance: “Sprung from what Line, You take an equal Chance. “I too the same resistless Law obey, “For ev'ry happy, or unhappy Day. “The Pains or Pleasures of the Married State, “Hang on the same Necessity of Fate. “Yet far as Human Prudence can secure; “There let your Common Oath my Peace insure. “Swear—When in Form my plighted Hands I bind, “(Whate'er the Object that shall take my Mind) “All due Obeysance to the Chosen Maid “Be fully shown; all Homage freely paid: “Her Right acknowledg'd, from the Nuptial Hour “As just, as had She brought the World in Dow'r. “And further; Be it solemnly agreed; “That None in Thought, or Look, in Word, or Deed: “Or of her Fortune grieve, or Birth complain. “Oppose Me here, I hold the Treaty vain. “This I exact. And Justice This requires. “Freedom and Peace I yield to your Desires. “Resign my Body; So the Public Voice “Demands: But never will resign my Choice. “Whate'er concerns the State is not withstood; “Slave I will be, with Pleasure for her Good. “Yet, as a Royal Slave my Port maintain, “And to my Fancy fit the Fashion of my Chain.” Assent from All, the just Proposal bore, And solemnly the tender'd Oath They swore; Praying, e're yet They took their sev'ral Way, To fix the Spousal, and assign the Day: Still dreading that Gualtherus wou'd not wed. For when cou'd Subjects find no Cause of Dread? To leave no Doubt of his determin'd Mind; He fix'd the Spousal, and the Day assign'd. Term of his Future War, or Future Rest! A Chance incurr'd (He said) at their Request! Full low They thank Him on their bended Knees; For Vulgar Minds well-tim'd Concessions please. And home again all merrily They tend; Proud, by their Conduct, to have gain'd their End. Mean time their Lord (as Marriage Form requires) Appoints his privy Knights, and trusty Squires, As well for Pomp as Order, to provide; To grace the Rite, and dignify the Bride. Strict Charge, on every Chief attendant, lays, And eager ev'ry Chief the Charge obeys. Nor Ought was spar'd of Service or Delight, To dignify the Bride, or grace the Rite. The Day appointed for the Nuptials came; The Feast prepar'd: The Marquis still the same. Not One the chosen Consort cou'd devise. Tho' what escapes the Courtier's busy Eyes? To blame their Lord the Vulgar much incline; So close his Speech, so covert his Design? And Where They durst, in Secret, or Alone, Impeach his good Intent, because Unknown. “Slave to his Ease, (in Murmurs thus They said) “Imagin'd Ease! He still forbears to wed; “Our Suit and ev'n his Word, forgot the while: “Why will He thus Himself and Us beguile? The Morning pass'd; Approach'd the Noon of Day; The Ev'ning came: And still the same Delay. No Name went round! No Bride appear'd in Sight! Yet were the Nuptials fix'd to crown the Night. Ill cou'd the Croud (suspended to Despair) Indure such Myst'ry, such Delusion bear. For still the Palace seem'd the promis'd Word To keep, and justify its thoughtless Lord. There neat in Splendor, pompous in Array, Each spacious Hall and princely Chamber lay. Rich Furniture in costly Order plac'd; Never was Seat of Marriage nobler grac'd. Spread ev'ry Table; ev'ry Office stor'd; With Delicates to load the Bridal Board. All that the Compass of Italian Ground Cou'd yield, or might in Foreign Lands be found. But why prepar'd? No Mortal cou'd decide! For what was Bridal Pomp without a Bride? At Length appear'd Gualtherus, richly drest; And dawning Hope revives each anxious Breast. So wand'ring Trav'lers hail the blushing Ray, That first forebodes the kind Return of Day. And forth He rides. While all the Royal Court Attend; All bidden to the Nuptial Sport. With many a noble Dame of Beauty bright, And many a sprightly Peer, and valiant Knight; And all the chosen Gentry of the Land, Common or Squire, an honorable Band: With These, his trusty Guard, and houshold Train. And manfully their foaming Steeds They rein. Who, snorting to the Music's mingled Sound, Pass to the Vales, the neighb'ring Hills rebound. Rumor, the while, their close Attention drew; And busily, from Side to Side, She flew. A noted Dame attracts their Ears and Eyes; And mingles many Truths, with many Lies. A Dame, long practis'd in Intrigues of Court, Early in Youth She try'd the am'rous Sport; Nor late in Age cou'd wholly quit the Trade. Well cou'd She prompt the half-consenting Maid; And to the wishing Youth sage Counsel lend: In Her, Each found a most convenient Friend. Thrown out of Play, She overlook'd the Game; True Friend to Love! Bauderia was her Name. Unask'd tho' high of Rank, She join'd the Throng, And thus She tattled as She pac'd along. “Well! Now! the Marquis has reveal'd his Mind. “(All hear, on Right, on Left, Before, Behind.) “Soon as You pass the Wood, and reach the Lawn, “Where oft in File the marshal'd Troops are drawn; “You, from your Steeds, fair Ladies, must alight, “And single pass Review, within his Sight. “One He will chuse. For tho' He seems to fly, “He loves the Sex: You read it in his Eye. “Happy the Fair, to fix his Choice, assign'd! “And great his Singularity of Mind! “He lays his Crown and Scepter at her Feet, “For unexpected Good comes doubly sweet. “This He devis'd, for He is Good as Great, “In Honor to the Sex, and to the State; “Nor sought a Foreign Fair to deck his Throne, “Proud to display the Lustre of his own. “This, He declar'd the Cause of his Delay; “Declar'd in Council, and declar'd To-Day. “But 'twas a Secret kept by his Commands; “I know it to be Fact, and from good Hands.”. From Fair to Fair the pleasing Rumor spred; Hope fills each female Heart, and female Head. Daughters of Avarice his Wealth devour; Swell the Ambitious with the Thoughts of Pow'r. Rank fires the Proud; and Equipage the Vain; But Self-Opinion seizes all the Train. Hence, fast They fall to Scandal and Surmise; As Who might claim, but Who must lose the Prize. And strait each Beauty ev'ry Beauty nam'd; And ev'ry Beauty strait each Beauty blam'd. The Mart of Female Censure knows no Glut; Bring what You will, They tax it with a But. While thus, in Scrutiny, All sentence All. Daphne is Handsome; But She is too Tall! And honestly to judge 'twixt Friend and Foe, Silvia is pretty; But as much too Low! Delia, Men say, is fashion'd for a Wife; But sure it is a Piece of meer still Life! And Cloe affable, She knows no Pride; But is She not too Free, or much Bely'd? Aminta has a Voice, divine to hear; But then a Mouth that gapes from Ear to Ear! And Amarillis has a World of Fire; But then a Tongue that Socrates wou'd tire! Flavia has Beauty, But her Look is Mean; Ah think, my Dear, how She wou'd act the Queen! And Myra, Dignity of Voice and Air; But oh the Color of her Teeth and Hair! Trivia is Delicate; But then too Lean, A living Corps! Half Malady, Half Spleen! And, full of Health Nerina, 'tis confest; But 'tis a Beast of Burthen at the Best! Nature in Phillis made not one Mistake; But She is Young, who knows what She may make? And Phœbus in Serpilla's Eyes may shine; But You will grant 'tis Phœbus in Decline! The only Charm of Sapho is her Mind; But to get Lovers She must list the Blind! And Glaura's only Merit is her Shape; But if You are not Deaf You must escape! Cælia—(scarce Envy here a Fault cou'd spy,) Yes, 'tis not seen, But Cælia is awry! Not one was Worthy (For the Truth to own Each priz'd Herself) or of his Bed or Throne. And well I ween, were They to chuse the Wife, Full long the Prince might lead a Single Life. Mean time in Royal Pomp, and proud Array, Along the Dale Gualtherus shap'd his Way; To where a low but cleanly Village stood, Wash'd by a Stream, and border'd by a Wood! Of homely Cots compos'd; For such as fed The fleecy Kind, or lowing Oxen bred; For such as mow'd the Meads, or plow'd the Fields; And liv'd on What industrious Labor yields. Here, lov'd by All, an honest Rustic dwell'd, Of all the poorer Swains the poorest held. Blest with a Soul superior to his Fate, For all his Wish was suited to his State. Here in this narrow Circle cou'd He find, What not the World can give, Content of Mind. But yet what All may on Themselves bestow. And here It left the High to bless the Low: The Princely Palace for the Oxen Stall. Him, good Janicola the Neighbors call. A Daughter crown'd his Age, of spotless Fame, Tho' noted Form; Griselda was her Name. A Fairer, not the journeying Sun surveys, Or with his rising, or his falling Rays. A Chaster, never happy Mother bore, In Days of Present, or in Days of Yore. Strict in her Duty, faithful to her Trust, She shun'd Temptation, specious Lure to Lust. Yet, far as Virtue may, She sought to please; And honest Toil prefer'd to dang'rous Ease. Of Diet temp'rate, cautious of Excess, Drank oftner of the Spring, than of the Press. For Wine adds Fuel to the tender Breast, The Springs of Youth not Motion want, but Rest. Wisely she shun'd all adventitious Heat. Simple her Dress, but yet tho' simple, neat. Tho' blest of Face, and of a tender Age, She wou'd not be ingag'd, nor wou'd ingage. Free from the Dart of Love She kept her Heart, Nor yet at Others strove to throw the Dart. Such Swains as sought her Father's Voice to gain, In Birth not Soul her Equals, met Disdain. Base Commerce with Superiors She declin'd, For conscious Worth sat scepter'd in her Mind. Her aged Father was her tend'rest Care His failing Nature studious to repair; And oft his Life her Diligence repriev'd, Repaying back the Breath She had receiv'd. And next to That her Duty was to keep, Nor great the Charge, his scanty Flock of Sheep. And forth She led Them, soon as Day begun; And home She drove Them, with the setting Sun. Then was She wont with filial Joy to bring, Whate'er produc'd, the Summer, or the Spring, Of Herbs, or Fruits: What Autumn might afford, Or Winter spare to spread the frugal Board. In houshold Thrift She spent each vacant Hour, Arm'd against Pleasure, for She fear'd the Pow'r. Hence no false Bait cou'd her chaste Heart intice: For Sloth She counted the first Step to Vice. Her, as He used to cross the neighb'ring Green, Gualtherus joy'd to see, and oft had seen. Her matchless Beauty took his wand'ring Sight, And hap'ly minister'd unknown Delight. 'Twas the first Dawn of Passion in his Breast; And neither settled Care, nor total Rest. More frequent came He here, the various Game To rouze; nor knew Himself, why here He came. 'Twas thought, the near Adjacence of the Place, The Country round commodious for the Chace, Still to this Spot his Course inclines and draws; Or any Thing beside the real Cause. Yet hither when He led the Sportive Train, A secret Pleasure thrill'd in ev'ry Vein; But if averse, He turn'd the flying Prey, Tedious the Course, and joyless was the Day. Next, as She charm'd his Eye, She charm'd his Ear, 'Twas sweet Delight her modest Voice to hear; The native Language of an artless Mind, Unpractis'd in the Trains of Womankind. Oft, by Design, He from the Croud wou'd stray, And oft pretend Occasions of Delay; Loss of the Sport! Or Failure of his Horse! And tempt Her to more free, but chaste Discourse. Still pleas'd (Whate'er She said, Whate'er declin'd) In humble State exalted Worth to find, And note each decent Look, and just Reply, With glad Attention, but with watchful Eye. Watchful! lest ev'n to distant View betray'd, Envy might wrong the inoffensive Maid. Prudential Cares the best Affection prove; No Vanity He knew, nor yet knew Love. Sincere Regard protects the Fair from Blame; Hence what He priz'd, He dreaded to defame. Then, Home as He returns, his Thoughts retrace, Her winning Innocence! Her bashful Grace! Her pious Care! Her unaffected Mien! (Beauties in Courtly Dames too rarely seen.) Her Form, not spoil'd by Art, by Nature wrought! And far above her Sex her Manly Thought! No Poverty of Language to express! No! Nought of Poverty but in her Dress. Thus Homeward musing was he wont to ride; And thus Himself, Himself unknowing, try'd. “Blest is the Swain, that to his faithful Breast “This Virgin joins, cou'd Marriage make him blest. “Yes, I will own, was I reduc'd to wed, “Or fear'd not, more than Death, that Bondage Bed, “None, but Griselda, wou'd I chuse for Wife: “But ah! what Woman answers Slavish Life! “Not for the Cause, the Many may misguide, “That in our ancient Ancestry I pride; “And rather than their Dignity disgrace, “Wou'd torture Nature, than demean my Race. “Tho' this be Common Sense. 'Tis without Ground, “Sense is by Truth, not by Opinion bound. “Much fashion'd Vice from false Opinion springs; “But lasting Virtue from the Truth of Things. “Let Vulgar Souls the Worldly Worth define, “Of hoarded Wealth, or long-continued Line; “With Me, to be Well-born, is to be Good; “And Merit, the pure Stream of Noble Blood. “But whither wou'd these wild Conclusions drive? “To Where I neither tend nor can arrive? “Full happy may the Maid (where-e'er her Fate “Bestows Her) make, and find that Casual State; “A Bliss, so dear the Price, by me unsought: “An idle Question! And a wand'ring Thought!” Thus wou'd He war, to strong Mistrust inclin'd, Twixt Sense of Love, and Prejudice of Mind. But now, to quit his boasted Peace, constrain'd, Now, that no Hope of Liberty remain'd; These Barriers of his Passion once remov'd, With Rapture He reflects on Her He lov'd. Then the fair Object, rooted in his Breast, Stood forth, in all the Pow'r of Fancy drest. So the pent Stream, obstructed in his Course, The Damms o'erthrown, pours with re-doubled Force. So the tam'd Steed with Fury scours the Plain, When from the curbing Hand He snaps the Rein. Meantime the Maid, full Innocent of Mind, Nor knew the smother'd Flame, nor Grace design'd. With snow-white Pail She sought the Silver Spring, Thence, Nature's pure Munificence to bring; Or for her own, or for her Father's Need: And Home return'd with more than wonted Speed. For now, She heard her Rustic Neighbors say, Her Lord wou'd wed, and this the promis'd Day. And tho' gay Sport was not her fond Delight, Full fain wou'd She have seen this Courtly Sight. For This, with Haste She bears the limpid Freight, Nor dreamt, how near She verg'd on Better Fate; How soon to change her Cottage for a Throne: And celebrate no Nuptial but Her own. She but propos'd to end without Delay The Houshold Labors of the short'ning Day; Then, at her homely Gate resolv'd to stand, And with her Equals view the Royal Band; While to the Lawn their splendid Course They hold: As Swains returning from Saluzzo told. Yet Something here She found, nor yet cou'd find The Cause, that pain'd her Heart, and griev'd her Mind; Something, that seem'd to trouble and perplex: Envy, (You'll say) insep'rate from the Sex: A virtuous Envy still, and well refin'd! Corrected Vice, uncommon to the Kind! 'Twas not, that other's Pleasure gave her Pain; 'Twas not, that his Regard had made Her vain; Nor Malice to the Bride, to Her unknown; Yet cou'd She wish Her any other Throne. Gualtherus too Her Innocence confess'd, She cou'd not wish debas'd, to have possess'd. But had, revers'd, their Distance been as great; His low as her's, and high as his her State: His Worth, She inly thought, had fix'd her Choice, No Pow'r, or Wealth had brib'd her Partial Voice. His Steed, Gualtherus quitting at the Gate, Gave to a Squire, and bade th' Attendance wait. Scarce had he enter'd, when Griselda came, At Distance known: He call'd Her by her Name. She down her Pail, beside the Oxen Stall, Hastes to depose, and on her Knees to fall. And thus in humble Guise continues still, As One that waits to hear the Royal Will. Tho' fix'd all Sign of Passion to withstand, Forward He step'd, and rais'd Her with his Hand. While All, that of her Innocence or Truth He fram'd, or of her Beauty felt, or Youth, Fell short, to what his present Thoughts admire; Her Eyes, so full of Modesty, yet Fire! The Discomposure of her Face and Frame, Blushing, and trembling, with ingenuous Shame! “Say—is—Janicola?” His Tongue affords Uneasy Utt'rance to these easy Words. And, cover'd with Confusion as She stands, “He—is (She cries,) He waits—his Lord's Commands. Within the homely Cot not long She sought, And to his Lord her ancient Father brought. Him by the Hand He takes, and leads aside; Then thus: “In Me, Janicola, confide. “My faithful Vassal wer't Thou wont to rest; “Nor let the Father with the Prince contest. “No longer will I boast the Pow'r or Art, “To check my Will, or to disguise my Heart; “Thy Daughter, chaste of Fame as fair of Sight, “I claim, but wou'd not claim by Force but Right.” On Earth the honest Rustic fix'd his Eyes, Shock'd with Mistrust, astonish'd with Surprize, At length He rais'd; unable to controul The Pow'r of Virtue working in his Soul: “My Sovereign Liege, oh! pardon (He reply'd) “To serve You, was my Joy, to please, my Pride; “To please You, and to serve You, as I ought. “But sure, my Ignorance mistakes your Thought? “If my Griselda may some Merit claim, “She shou'd not pass thro' Infamy to Fame. “Not such my early Care, not such appears “Her cautious Youth; She will not wrong my Years. “Nor wrong her own. Tho' Daughter of a Swain, “And bred in Want, She lives without a Stain. “And may I, of thy Slaves the Meanest Slave, “E'er Virtue She forsake, prepare her Grave. “Here, in this narrow Compass Fortune grants “Sufficient for her Wishes and my Wants. “Sufficient yields our Flock, tho' small our Fold, “To guard both Her and Me from Heat and Cold. “The Stream gives Liquor, and the Forest, Fire. “Possess We Little? Little We desire. “Ev'n This to your Benevolence We owe; “But rather re-assume what You bestow, “Than We from simple Honesty depart, “And know a Mind corrupt, or vicious Heart. “Still may We live, in Innocence and Ease, “Pleas'd with our Charge, nor basely seek to please. “And, if so far a Father may presume, “Bear Her to Court, You bear Her to Her Tomb. The Pleasure that from virtuous Action flows, The Man of Virtue only feels and knows. Gualtherus own'd a Joy that rose to Pain, To find so worthy, yet so poor a Swain. He smil'd; and to Himself in secret Sport: “Few had return'd this Negative at Court.” Then to Janicola. “My fair Design “Mistake not, Friend. By Right I claim Her mine; “With Me, (consent but Thou) to lead her Life, “Not, as You wrong my Sense, but as my Wife.” Mute with Amaze, and with Confusion red, “Thy Will be mine,” was all the Father said. Gualtherus strait, pursuing his Intent, Within the lowly Cot full humbly went; The bashful Maid He bade approach Him nigh; (All this He will'd beneath the Father's Eye) Surpris'd She stood with Wonder and Delight, For never had She seen so fair a Sight. And unaccustom'd to so great a Guest, Pale grew her Cheek, and much disturb'd her Breast. He mark'd the sweet Disorder of the Maid, And thus completes the Plan, maturely laid. “Griselda, know, my Purpose is to Wed, “And make Thee Partner of my Throne and Bed. “Thy Father yields Consent our Hands to join; “What more remains but to solicite thine? “Ought need I add? The Offer shews my Love; “And Time, I hope, thy Constancy will prove. “All that I ask is quietly to live. “Then freely give, What only You can give. “The Match, 'tis true, too much of Haste requires; “Your Thoughts I know not, tho' I feel my Fires. “To speak my Passion, or thy Truth to try, “Time fails; then let me add this further Tie. “Swear, that with ready Will, and honest Heart, “Like or dislike, without Regret or Art, “In Presence, or alone, by Night or Day, “All that I will, you fail not to obey; “All I intend, to forward That you seek, “Nor ever once object to what I speak. “Nor yet, in Part alone, my Wish fulfill; “Nor tho' You do it, do it with Ill-Will. “Nor with a forced Compliance half refuse; “And acting Duty, all the Merit lose. “To strict Obedience add a willing Grace, “And let your Soul be painted on your Face. “No Reasons giv'n, and no Pretences sought, “To swerve in Deed or Word, in Look or Thought. Hard terms, I doubt, may judge the Modern Maid, Marriage dear-bought! And Grandeur overpaid! Not so Griselda. And observe her Life, All that the Maid propos'd, perform'd the Wife. “How much thy Vassal falls below thy Care, (This just Reply She made with modest Air) “I own; In Indigence Begot and Bred: “Stain to thy Race, Dishonor to thy Bed! “This known, was neither Oath nor Vow to bind, “What honest Heart cou'd stray, what virtuous Mind? “Had Fortune join'd Me to the meanest Swain, “That tends your lowing Herd, or bleating Train; “Him to obey, had been my Choice in Life, “The meanest Swain had found a faithful Wife. “Thus honor'd, ill I merited to live, “Gave I not That which only I can give; “What ev'ry Slave might claim. But if those Eyes “Have found Ought here to prize, Myself I prize: “Mindful to Whom I owe my happier Fate; “Nor yet forgetful of my former State. “Sense of your Worth, and Gratitude conspire “To firm this Bond; I swear, as You require: “Still to remain observant of your Will, “Your ev'ry Charge religiously fulfill; “By that sole Rule my future Life to lead: “Nor swerve in Thought or Look, in Word or Deed.” “No other Dow'r I ask, (Gualtherus cry'd) “The World shou'd tempt me to no other Bride.” Then led Her to the Door: And thus aloud Accosts the menial and the noble Croud. “Here, on this Seat of Hope, I rest my Life. “This Maid, and None but Her, I take to Wife. “To This, my Better Part, that Homage show, “All that you owe your Prince, or think You owe. The Ladies then he bade reform her Dress, (Retir'd within the Cot's remote Recess) And richly deck, as Princely Rites require, Nor leave one Remnant of her old Attire; Resolv'd, that e'er She reach'd the Royal Gate, Her Bridal Pomp shou'd suit her Wifely State; Her Mind so noble, and Her Form so fair, First fix'd his Choice: And last requir'd his Care. In flock the Fair, to dress the Rural Maid, On Nuptials pleas'd to lend their useful Aid. Some mov'd by Duty; by Good-nature Some: Some meditating Marriages to come; And ruminating Some on Pleasures past: Some curious, and Some envious: Most, the Last. But All, on Entrance, loud Surprize express'd, To see the Courtly Bride, so Country Dress'd. For nobly born, and delicately bred, Her rude Apparel rais'd a gen'ral Dread. Such Linnen, never felt! Seen Garments such! So rough! So coarse! They almost swoon to touch Deep-principl'd in vain affected Airs, Of Framing Fears, and Counterfeiting Cares; Of Feigning Woe, where They rejoice at Heart; And Pain Dissembling, where They feel no Smart; Not One less Horror witness'd than the Rest, Not One so low, as not to seem distrest. Each, as the painful Office They pursue, Oft gave her injur'd Hand, and oft withdrew. Oft turn'd her Head, ev'n in Griselda's Sight, Lest other Dames might think Her less polite, Unless some Sign of Censure She had shown, That any Thing, so dress'd, shou'd mount a Throne. Then, sends the speedy Embassage of Eyes, To prove her Taste, and witness her Surprize; Then, starting back, her supple Body bends, As if Infection the vile Work attends. For softer Tasks their polish'd Limbs were made; This, was meer Drudg'ry! Meer mechanic Trade! Ill cou'd their whiter Fingers bear the Soil; Or weaker Arms support the grievous Toil. “But This the Prince—And he is free to chuse, “And None in common Manners can refuse.” This vast Fatigue, with mighty Pain subdued; More easy was the Charge that next insued. The Sight of rich Apparel glads the Fair, Fond to admire, tho' destin'd not to wear! For now, more sumpt'ous Cloaths th' Attendants brought, In secret, by their Lord's Direction wrought; Shap'd to the fairest Maiden of the Court: (The Measure gayly taken as in Sport) Cælia the Maid; Alike her Turn and Size. Such just Observers still are Lovers Eyes! Full-well each fashion'd Dame performs her Part; Skill'd in the Myst'ries of the Toilet Art. By Each some happy Master-stroke was shown, The flowing Robe adjusting by her own. Rich was the Robe, and glorious to behold, Beset with costly Stones incas'd in Gold; The plainer Ground of pure Cerulean Dye; And oft the Hand was stop'd to feast the Eye. Her Hair They comb'd, that rudely lay untress'd, But soon reclaim'd, and in new Order dress'd: And Store They add of adventitious Charms, Rings for the Hands, and Bracelets for the Arms; With pearly Rows, with Golden Bands was grac'd The rising Bosom, and the falling Waist; And last a Crown was plac'd upon her Head, That prominent with Gems a mingled Lustre shed. Patient, beneath their Hands, Griselda sits, And to their various Wills her Limbs submits; But secret wish'd, less Pomp had been prepar'd, And much of their polite Exactness spar'd. The Vain with sudden Change are soon elate, The Stupid have no Relish of their Fate; The two Extreams She wisely steer'd between, Her Rule of Action was the Golden Mean. She nor with Idiot-laugh her Bliss proclaims, Nor with vain Triumph treats the Courtly Dames; Not tho' She saw her Fortune inly vex: She mild forgave the Failure of the Sex. And yet not senseless of her Good remains; But rising Pleasure prudently restrains. The Wise their Bliss in Contemplation find; Joy is not of the Tongue, but of the Mind! Yet oft with quicker Throbs her Bosom rose, And oft her Face with warmer Blushes glows; And softer Smiles to paint her Lips arise, And brighter Rays to animate her Eyes. The Fair themselves, that joint Assistance lend, Not apt the Charms of Others to commend, With Looks of silent Praise, alternate thrown, Well nigh prefer her Beauty to their own. Who (still improv'd beneath their forming Hands) At once their Love and their Respect commands. But loud Applause (produc'd in publick View) The Vulgar add, still fond of What is New! Transform'd (They thought) a new Griselda shown: Slaves to Appearance, Not transform'd but known! Not such Material Change their Lord confess'd, Who bore her fairer Image in his Breast; Who, not by outward Show, her Form survey'd, And more her Merit than her Beauty weigh'd. Yet, for He knew that Dress improves the Face, (As Eloquence to Sense adds better Grace) Her just Adornment gratify'd his Sight, Pleas'd to behold Her in the fairest Light. He on her Hands, up-rais'd with decent Shame, Affix'd the Ring, that binds the Nuptial Claim. Then, on a snow-white Steed, the Virgin plac'd, With Crimson Reins and Silver Trappings grac'd. Loud shout the coming and returning Throng, As to the Royal Court they pass along; In Revel there the finish'd Day He spends; Till down the Western Steeps the Sun descends. But not on Things Minute to dwell too long— (For copious is the Remnant of our Song.) The new-made Bride with such true Merit shone, She gave (not borrow'd) Lustre from the Throne. So form'd her Speech, so fashion'd was her Mien; So Just, but Mild! So Aweful, but Serene! Not Envy in her Look or Soul cou'd trace, Her low Condition or ignoble Race. In Nought She seem'd by Rustick Parents fed, In Meanness nurtur'd, or in Rudeness bred; No Daughter of a Cottage humbly born, But sprung a Princely Palace to adorn; Nor only to adorn, but to support; Not only fill, but dignify a Court. Her spreading Fame the Crowd with Wonder hears, (Who knew her Birth) and scarce believe their Ears; Gaze the Nobility with like Surprize, And doubt the nearer Evidence of Eyes. For tho' her lowly Virtue was the same, Exalted thus It show'd a brighter Flame. Virtue lies undiscover'd when confin'd, Unfelt the Will, unless the Power be join'd. Her known Example may this Truth declare, So Witty, yet so Wise; so Chaste, yet Fair! So strictly Merciful, so humbly Great! Such winning Grace, and such complying State! Her Looks their Love, Her Words their Wonder won, Diffus'd on All, Indulgent as the Sun! Not only thro' Saluzzo spread her Fame, But distant Regions heard her bounteous Name; And ever lavish on her Praises dwell: Well as One spoke, Another spoke as Well. And Thousands came, Alike the Young as Old, Women as Men, to hear Her and behold. Thus Honesty for once and Honor wed, And Humble Fortune decks a Princely Bed. The dis-believing Lord himself confess'd, 'Twas possible in Marriage to be blest. At Home his Peace preserv'd the prudent Wife, Abroad his Wealth supply'd the Wants of Life: And more than Life requires. For kept from Waste, Enough remains for Elegance of Taste. And for that Worth, thro' Poverty's Disguise, Discern'd their Lord, The People held him Wise. This as no common Incident be told; 'Tis what the People are not apt to hold. Yet not in Houshold Cares (tho' These alone Are worthy Praise) her Excellence was shown; Absent her Lord, full wisely cou'd She guide The Publick State, The Common Good provide: In Judgment equal, easy of Access, Complaints to hear, or Errors to redress. And ready, as successful, to asswage, Or private Discontent, or public Rage. Of Counsel prudent, steady to her Trust, Strong in Persuasion, in Discernment just. And when at Strife, (For Strife all States afford) She reconciled the People to their Lord. So sought his Peace, and so their Welfare sought, Urg'd with such Pow'r of Speech, and Strength of Thought; That rarely was her Judgment found to fail: And if He held the Sword, She held the Scale. Hence all Degrees, the Senate and the Crowd, Her Justice own'd, her Clemency allow'd; A Gift of Heav'n their Fortune to attend, Not only to preserve the State, but mend. Blest was the Subject, and the Sov'reign blest! All shar'd her Worth, He all her Worth possess'd. Nor yet the Sun had fill'd his Annual Round, E'er a new Pledge of Love the Nuptials crown'd. A Daughter crown'd! Whose sweetly-op'ning Face Adorn'd the Bed with near-resembling Grace. And tho' (The better to reward her Care) The anxious Mother wish'd a Manly Heir; Pleas'd was Gualtherus, nor displeas'd the State, To find their Wishes half indulg'd by Fate. For, from that Sample of Inferior Kind, The Promise of a Nobler—They divin'd. The Charge Griselda, Mistress of a Throne, Intrusted to no Care, beside her own. Gualtherus long oppos'd, at length comply'd, Dissenting most from Love, but much from Pride. No Matrimonial Jar! For here the Strife Was not to burthen, but to spare the Wife. He press'd their common Dignity and Ease, And yielded but to humor, and to please. Yet She maintain'd, (her Argument was strong) “Whole Nature bias'd to preserve their Young. “Of all the Habitants of Earth and Air, “Shall Human Kind take less than Savage Care? “I own (She said) This seems a Country Strain, “The Language of the Daughter of a Swain; “What to the Crowd may furnish Mirth and Sport, “And give Distaste and Wonder to the Court. “Yet will I say, (For This You taught my Youth) “Trust not to Show of Things, but to the Truth. “Be Truth the Rule; Polite or Impolite, “I weigh not what is thought, but what is right. “The Point let Courtly Dames with Leave contest, “This lovely Child shall never quit my Breast. “'Tis Vice of Fashion! 'Tis Neglect of Kind! “'Tis Indolence! 'Tis Cruelty of Mind! To such a Husband added such a Wife; What fairer Scene cou'd yield Domestic Life? Each seems of Each the Fortune to controul, Each worthy Each in Body as in Soul So fair the Road, and so direct to Bliss, Their Way a Pair so form'd cou'd hardly miss; Unless with open Eyes They go astray, And wilfully their fated Joy betray. And so It chanc'd. To plain Conviction blind, Gualtherus makes the Ill He cou'd not find. Tho' never had She shock'd his Ear or Sight; No Woman cou'd be always in the Right. This was his Pain; To strong Mistrust inclin'd, No Proof cou'd turn the Bias of his Mind. But where to fix a Fault, He seem'd distrest; Was ever Husband so severely prest? First for her Beauty; That was free from Blame: Nature ne'er fashion'd a completer Frame! Next for her Mind; That gave him less Pretence; Nought but her Wit was equal to her Sense! Then o'er her Virtue quick his Scruples run; Fair as the Light, and spotless as the Sun! Her Duty last He weighs; No Failure past Appears. Yet restless there He settles last. Her former Conduct was not void of Praise; But never was She put to hard Assays. Perhaps 'twas Indolence! Perhaps 'twas Art! Int'rest or Fear! She acted well her Part! Content in trivial Things is easy shown! Obedience by the Proof is only known! To vain Disquiet of their common Lives, Thus Tyrant-Husbands tempt their Subject-Wives. Full-unadvis'd We deem; Some think full-wise. But obvious (duely judged) the Error lies. Mischances numberless, to cause Debate On either side, affords the various State; This Want to aggravate, that Sense to vex. The Lesson We apply to either Sex. Some heedless Word or Action may offend, Speak ne'er so kind, and ne'er so just intend; Whence Noise and Strife, Mistrust, Aversion springs. Add here the common Casualty of Things. Each to the Other by Alliance bound, But then Each borders on the Other's Ground. On Truce howe'er let Marriage-Warfare cease. Act not Hostilities in Time of Peace. Till Provocation raises fresh Alarms, Let Neither rouse the Bosom Foe to Arms. When safe a-shore thy shatter'd Bark repair, The Gale of Hymen blows not always fair. Pierce not in wanton Sport her weaker Sides, Enough has She to bear from Winds and Tides. If then those Ills, that Neither can prevent, Wives suffer patient; Husbands, live content! Alone, by Night, where lay the Royal Dame, With Visage sternly-sad Gualtherus came; Whom in unwonted Terms He thus address'd. “Griselda, say! Retains thy faithful Breast, “Some just Remembrance of that Golden-Day, “When first I threw your rural Weeds away, “And with more fitting Pomp and Splendor grac'd? “Or, say! Has Time the grateful Thought eraz'd? “And Dignity, by Use familiar grown, “Made Thee o'er-look the Cottage in the Throne? “Yet not so many glorious Months have run, “Since this thy new-created Pow'r begun. “Review Thyself, and by Reflection know, “High as You stand, that once You stood as low. “'Tis Thine this Grace with Duty to requite. “For That, I chose the Silence of the Night, “Safe from each list'ning Ear, and prying Eye, “Thy Constancy to prove, thy Truth to try; “Pay you just Faith, or feign'd Regard pretend. “Then know my Will, and strict Atttention lend. “E'er since the Day that first prefer'd You here, “Not by Thyself thy Life was held more dear. “Part of my Own! But far the better Part! “You shar'd not more my Fortune than my Heart. “Not such the Love You from the Subject claim, “Grievous They think the Load, and great the Shame. “Up-rais'd from humble State thy Worth to see, “(Thy Worth unknown) up-rais'd to high Degree! “Begot in Slav'ry! In a Cottage born! “Their private Laughter! And their secret Scorn! “But ever since that hapless Child You bore, “Loud are their Plaints, not wholly dumb before. “My Rule in Ills, is still to make the Best, “(Some Ease may follow, if not total Rest) “And press, or yield, ambitious of Repose; “Just as the Tide of Faction ebbs or flows. “Thy Daughter now—(and since the Child was born “Not thrice the Moon renew'd her silver Horn) “Thy Daughter now—their Tumult must appease,— “Not as I wou'd—But as my People please— “How loth to act the Deed—bear Witness Heav'n!— “Nor will I act—unless your Voice be giv'n.— “An equal Share You claim.—But fully know— “(And here your wonted Soul, Griselda, show) “Know, your Concurrence is my stated Will! “Yield! and by Deed your plighted Word fulfill! “Act what You swore upon our Marriage Day! “Mine then was to command, your Office to obey.” She all unmov'd the hard Condition hears; Nor Ought concern'd in Look or Thought appears. No Change his strict inquiring Eyes cou'd read. Much less oppos'd She or in Word or Deed. But said: “My Child, Myself too I resign! “Dispose at Will, my Lord: Your Will is Mine. “In You just Property of Either lies; “And Either for your Good, or lives, or dies. “My Soul (as Love and Gratitude require) “Likes, What you like; desires, What you desire. “Beside Yourself Nought else is left to chuse; “And Nought beside Yourself She dreads to lose. “This, (by your Grace since first our Hands were join'd) “Has been her first fix'd Principle of Mind. “This! Neither Change nor Fortune can displace; “Nor Length of Time, nor Fear of Death deface.” Pleas'd was Gualtherus against Nature's Laws. Cou'd Pleasure spring from such an odious Cause? Prepost'rous Joy! By Virtue not refin'd! Unworthy of Himself or Humankind! Yet long his Thoughts seem'd with themselves at strife, As doubtful to pronounce for Death or Life. Then, as resolv'd, a pensive Leave he took; Disturb'd his Gate, determin'd was his Look. Thence sped; a Messenger of Death he sought, To whom He full reveal'd his secret Thought. Before prepar'd, at Distance due to stand, And strictly execute his Lord's Command. Much on his Faith and oft had he rely'd; But in less Sanguinary Service try'd. Whate'er the Order giv'n, He spar'd no Pain, For from his Diligence accru'd his Gain. When Need or Danger call'd, was ever near, From Love or Duty, from Respect or Fear; The greater the Attempt, the bolder still; And there is but one Step from Bold to Ill! Strait to the Chamber where Griselda lay, Commission'd by his Lord, He took his Way. And sternly turning from the Infant Maid, Humanely, as his Nature cou'd, He said: “Displease the Act, Necessity may plead “Excuse; not Choice, but Force exacts the Deed. “And well the wise Griselda understands, “That Royal Mandates claim obedient Hands. “Much may we grieve the while, and long complain, “But to object, or to resist is vain. “'Tis Loss of Time, 'tis Sorrow thrown away; “The sooner eas'd, the sooner We obey. “Such is my Fate; commanded by my Lord “To seize this Child.”—He seiz'd Her at the Word. The tender Infant, innocent of Harm, Smiles on his griefly Beard, and hugs his bois'trous Arm. To Few, such Energy of Soul is giv'n, As show'd Griselda; 'Twas the Gift of Heav'n. At once she summon'd ev'ry Pow'r of Mind, And stood the Stress; foreboding, but resign'd. The Man She knew; Suspicious was his Name! Suspicious was his Office and his Fame! Nor less Suspicious was the Time and Place! But more Suspicious still his Speech and Face! What She must feel (The Wretch so arm'd and drest!) Is easier to be fancy'd, than exprest! All, that the Prince in dubious Words let fall, All, that Reflection cou'd to Mind recall; Seem'd true: (Her Apprehension, wrong or right) All that She fear'd, seem'd acted in her Sight. A bloody Scene of Innocence distrest! An Infant, torn, and murder'd, from her Breast! An Infant, by her hourly Tendance fed! Sweet Inmate of her Chamber and her Bed! Add here, just Cause of Horror and Affright, The Silence and the Darkness of the Night! The strange Neglect of Him her Soul approv'd, The Man She honor'd, and the Man She lov'd! To crown the Whole, this Ruffian Guard appears; Who can conceive It without Sighs or Tears? Black were his Locks, and nigh upright They stood, Smear'd were his Hands, as exercis'd in Blood. But, to do Justice to the virtuous Tale, Supply in Mind, where I in Language fail. Think by the Wife and Mother what was born, By Duty there, here by Affection torn; And be the Strife, if not describ'd, conceiv'd: 'Tis scarce to be imagin'd, or believ'd. Yet, as recorded Rolls the Fact relate, She bore the Storm, collected and sedate. And since her Lord had doom'd the Child to die, Nor from her Bosom stole one stifled Sigh; Nor from her Eye escap'd one secret Tear: Tho' never Mother held a Child more dear. The Messenger of Death, She mildly pray'd, To reach the Child; whom on her Lap she laid. And gently begg'd, “E'er yet her sentence past, “One Kiss She might bestow, since 'twas the last.” Then with such Firmness, as no Tongue can tell, “Farewell, my Child, (She said) my Child, farewell! “Full-long a Flight thy thoughtless Soul must take, “Constrain'd to suffer, for thy Mother's Sake.” A State so woeful, Who cou'd see or hear, Without a social Sigh, or friendly Tear? What Nurse, that turns her Tendance to a Trade? What mean Domestic? Mercenary Maid? Well might the suff'ring Mother feel Distress! Yet no Concern her Looks or Words express. So strongly Love and Gratitude cou'd bind! And such her Force, and her Command of Mind! She to the Guard, whose Aspect Horror bred, “Here, take thy little Charge (compos'dly said) “Go! Act thy Office, as thy Lord commands. “Yes, Royal Mandates claim obedient Hands. “And what is his Desire, is my Content. “Yet, with his Leave (nor will He here dissent) “Depose her Body in some sacred Place; “Where neither Birds may touch, nor Beasts deface.” To This, no Word the Ruffian deign'd to say, But seiz'd the Child, and sternly stalk'd away. Strait to his Lord the Messenger repair'd, And faithfully, what He observ'd, declar'd; And, far as Tenderness cou'd touch his Breast, Told all, He thought, She suffer'd, or express'd. Gualtherus, Who esteem'd him plain, but just, In the Recital loses his Distrust. Till, fresh Possession, Prejudice regain'd; “Go, execute (He cries) as I ordain'd. “Convey the Child.”—A Trial so severe Sure Mother never felt! As You shall hear. Ev'n tho' his Heart, inclining to relent, Oft seem'd to disapprove it, and repent; Firm He maintain'd his settled Purpose still, And, as the Great are wont, wou'd have his Will. The Part assign'd, at Forfeit of his Life, The Guard performs. Gualtherus seeks his Wife. Full-fast imagining, in secret Thought, Or in her Looks to see some Strangeness wrought, Or some Confusion in her Words confest; But smooth He found her Brow, and calm her Breast! Collected in Herself She rests Sedate; Nor swell'd with high, nor sunk with adverse Fate! Submiss and Chearful, as She wont to prove! In Duty Faithful! Diligent in Love! Unchang'd her Turn of Speech, and Bent of Mind! Wise, as Agreeable! Discreet, as Kind! Nor mention'd once her Tongue her Daughter's Name; A Loss She cou'd not praise, but wou'd not blame! Hence the fourth Sun had fill'd the Year complete, And vary'd the due Change of Cold and Heat. Unchang'd to Her the varying Seasons run; With Peace concludes the Day, with Joy begun. The only Cause, that cou'd disturb her Breast, Was that She found Gualtherus ill at Rest. A Child He wish'd. Nor cou'd Griselda find, Why that unvalu'd Wish shou'd pain his Mind. So free to part with what was in his Pow'r; Yet now, He counted ev'ry Day and Hour. At Length, Heav'n gratify'd his full Desire; And doubly bless'd the Mother and the Sire. A Son was born. All hail the hopeful Boy; Their common Safety, and their common Joy! All, that their Country love, and Faction hate! All, that wish well to Sov'reign, or to State. Unfruitful deem'd the Wife, the Daughter dead; The Want of Issue new Commotion bred. The Next-ally'd in diff'rent Parts divide, And draw the giddy Croud on ev'ry Side. Pride and Ambition no Occasion lose, To feast on Heirless Crowns with eager Views. While Fuel ev'ry neighb'ring Pow'r supplies, And blows the Blaze, in Hopes to reap the Prize. When now a Son appear'd, oppos'd to All, The Factious, from their high Pretensions, fall. This Turn their Pride, if not their Cause, befriends; Each ends the Contest, where his Rival ends. The Loyal joy'd, to see the Tumult cease, A firm Foundation laid for lasting Peace, All disagreeing Int'rests reconcil'd; And hail'd with kind Presage the Royal Child. Lovely the Child, and Manly to behold! Mild, as his Mother! As his Father, Bold! Scarce the third Year began with full Repose, When, to disturb the Calm, Gualtherus rose. Hapless in This, that Happy was his Life; Again must He assay the Patient Wife. Capricious Husband, to Conviction blind! What Proof cou'd fix that doubtful Turn of Mind? If long Experience but augments your Care? Must Man provoke, and Woman ever bear? Survey the State of Wedlock at a View, A Case so strange, Who ever heard or knew? The Husband lives dissatisfy'd in Thought, Because the Wife lives guiltless of a Fault. Tempt Her He must; full-vainly, dare I say. Men keep no Bounds, where Women will obey. Imperious most, to Those that most indure. Such, He. But Patience is a sov'reign Cure. When Night had spread her sable Umbrage round, Griselda, hanging o'er her Boy, He found. “Know (He began) but This thyself must know— “Thy Marriage has produc'd a World of Woe. “The Subject ill our first Affiance took, “With lying Voice, and counterfeited Look. “A Daughter born, They lessen'd their Disguise; “Their Spleen arose apparent in their Eyes: “A Son, their open Malice kept no Bound. “And on the Mother their Distaste They found. “'Tis true, not yet the Clamor strikes our Ear; “With Terror yet the bad Report I hear. “Tho', ill or well, the Prince observes his Trust, “Faction is dang'rous, or unjust or just. “What Slav'ry (thus the Disaffected cry) “Attends Saluzzo, shou'd Gualtherus die! “Then shall Janicola's mean Blood succeed; “His base-rais'd Offspring! His opprobrious Breed! “Then shall They lord it! Hold the foremost Place! “What Hope of other Rule, or other Race? “Then well may Villagers our Rights support! “And Slaves receive the Honors of a Court! “Tho' distant yet the Voice of Discontent, “Thus warn'd, let Prudence the Increase prevent “E'er yet in open Audience They complain: “That done, the Terms propos'd may then be vain. “For judge but of the Future by the Past, “All private Murmur will speak loud at Last. “What Need of Words? To open all my Soul— “Better resign a Part, than lose the Whole.” He paus'd, and sighing—“Yes, It must be Done; “The Fate your Daughter found, attends your Son— “By the same Hand, on the same Hour of Night, “Torne from your Bosom, carried from your Sight— “Harder the Trial, with the Boy to part, “Longer in View, and nearer to your Heart— “He grew to Sense, was knowing, and was known— “The Loss, a Parent well may feel, and own. “For This I came, to warn You and persuade, “To summon ev'ry Virtue to your Aid. “Lest hurried from Yourself, You quit the Rein, “And ill your Trust and Character maintain.” Thus He; the Wively Patience thus rejoin'd. “This, have I said; and This, I bear in Mind: “Your Will is Mine! Your Pleasure, Mine I make! “Forsake Me, Life, e'er I this Rule forsake! “Slain as your Daughter, let your Son be Slain; “Confirm his Being, or his Death ordain! “In Her, in Him, no Claim Griselda knows, “But her long Vigils, and Maternal Throws. “What, but a short Amusement was her Gain, “For previous Sickness, and successive Pain? “All other Right belongs to You alone; “Yours be it, to conduct what is your own. “Consider my Content, below your Care; “In neither Child Griselda claims a Share. “I too am Yours, in all and ev'ry Part, “For when you gave your Hand, I gave my Heart. “Not that I plead Affection, yet deny “Obedience due; I own the forceful Tie. “From that then blest to this still happy Day, “(E'er-since You threw my rural Weeds away) “Then I acknowledg'd, and acknowlege still, “That with my Habit I depos'd my Will, “Freedom of Action, Liberty of Choice; “Griselda's Voice must still confirm your Voice, “Urge what You urge, forbear what You forbear: “I wait your Order, as your Dress I wear. “Nay more: Had I your Thoughts by Prescience known, “Such passive Duty had not now been shown. “With your Felicity I cou'd not part, “Tho' ev'ry String It tore that brac'd my Heart. “Myself had been as forward to propose, “And quell the Tumult, e'er so high it rose. “But now that your Resolve is fully told, “Determin'd as your own, my Purport hold. “And were my Death but wanting to your Ease; “Death wou'd I bear, to serve You, or to please. “For Death, that weak or wicked Minds may move, “Makes no Comparison to Loss of Love.” Her steady Virtue fill'd Him with Surprise; Long on the Ground He look'd with musing Eyes: Then left her Presence, in Appearance, sad! But glad at Heart! Cou'd such a Heart be glad! And strait, the Ill-presaging Russian came, The same in Gesture, and in Face the same. Rude, as He seiz'd the Sister where She lay, He seiz'd the Brother; or in ruder Way. Worse than before, if worse He cou'd devise, More insolent his Steps, more stern his Eyes. A Scene, all human Nature must detest! Yet cou'd the feeling Mother steel her Breast. She clasp'd the Boy, then, (wonderful to tell!) She gently kiss'd, and mildly bade farewell. And thus address'd the Minister of Death: “This let me crave, when He resigns his Breath, “This (if your Lord object not) let me crave! “Provide my little Son a decent Grave! “His tender Limbs, full delicate to Sight, “Protect from Birds by Day, and Beasts by Night! She, humbly ask'd; He no Return affords: Unless in Looks, more horrible than Words. Her Strength of Soul, Gaultherus more and more Admir'd; a pure, but in-exhaustless Store! Like Gold, extracted from long-hidden Mines, That still the more 'tis try'd, the more refines. Yet was He not content. To such a Bent Of fix'd Mistrust, no Proof cou'd give Content. For now, his Quiet studious to perplex, He ruminates the Malice of the Sex! The Face of Ease, that hides the secret Smart! The Tongue, still-ready to bely the Heart! And oft, had there been Room, He seem'd inclin'd, To term her Patience, Cruelty of Mind! Such dread Effusion of her Infant's Blood, Unmov'd, what tender Mother had withstood? And tho' He knew (by strict Observance prov'd) That next to Him each tender Child She lov'd; And, but that Him She lov'd, lov'd more than Life: He doubts the Woman, forc'd to praise the Wife. He waited, if in Look, or Word estrang'd, Her Fondness lessen'd, or her Temper chang'd. But neither Word nor Look admit a Doubt, For all seem'd Peace within, and Joy without. One Harmony of Face and Soul appears; Days following Days, and Years succeeding Years. More true as She advanc'd in Age, She grew; (Cou'd genuin Truth be said to grow more true!) As if by Nature, not by Marriage, join'd, Two Forms were influenc'd by one Ruling Mind. Whate'er he sought, seen or unseen his Aim, Same as his Will, her Pleasure was the same. She thought, 'twas not her Province to contest, Her ready Faith suppos'd it for the Best. Whether the lovely Offspring liv'd or dy'd; Much tho' she fear'd, She cou'd not well decide; But still her Soul this Principle maintain'd, That if They dy'd, Gualtherus was constrain'd. She judg'd it his Misfortune, not his Fault, For much of his Humanity She thought; And much of her Concern this Thought remov'd, She knew, He cou'd not part with what He lov'd. This Sacrifice, if boist'rous Faction claim'd, She own'd, Hemust assent, nor cou'd be blam'd. But was it possible to steer between The Father and the Prince, and guard the Mean; She cou'd not frame the Risque, He had not ran, For so She took, nor so mistook the Man. Hoping the Best, and to the Worst resign'd; Such was her Force, and Confidence of Mind. Thro' all this mild Complacency of Life, Fell She, as Mother, yet She rose as Wife. No other Good, besides his Good, She knew, Of Worldly Int'rest, or of Private View. No Loss, beside his Loss, cou'd give Her Pain, No Gain advantage Her, beside his Gain. These were her Rules, these Hard but Golden Rules, (Not well observ'd in Matrimonial Schools.) Wives on their Husbands shou'd rely alone; And by maturer Judgment mend their own. Not so the Subject; Where his Conduct fail'd, More strict to mark, than where his Worth prevail'd. Fond of Complaint, and ready of Surmise, Each Princely Virtue, They cou'd turn to Vice. That here much Cause was giv'n, (must be allow'd) Much to alarm the Council and the Croud. Dark the Design. And wide the Rumor spred, And equal Horror and Compassion bred. The Silence of the Court some Guilt confess'd; The Children missing, Malice adds the Rest. Doubtful as He in Conduct, They severe In Censure, send the Tale from Ear to Ear. “Gualtherus, by unthinking Love misled, “First makes his Slave the Part'ner of his Bed. “And then, the Stain impatient to indure, “Adds to the vile Offence a viler Cure. “But what had the long-suff'ring Mother done? “(O'er Things unknown thus knowingly They run) “The Children, What? Then, such unnat'ral Death, “Giv'n by the Hand, that shou'd preserve their Breath!” On Facts uncertain, while the Croud debate, They hate, that lov'd; that lov'd not, doubly hate. Loud was His Infamy, as once his Fame! “A Murd'rer! an accurst, detested Name! “A Villain, not from Passion, but Design! “Abjur'd by Laws, both Human and Divine!” Yet might the People murmur, or assent, Gualtherus firm pursued his fixt Intent. But check a-while, my Muse, thy looser Rein, To court the Judgment of the Female Train. Full-fain wou'd I consult, in Time and Place, Their learn'd Opinion; Doubtful is the Case. Declare, Which, of the Two, was most to blame? Was He too rigid, or was She too tame? Each Husband left sole Arbiter of Life, What wou'd become of many an honest Wife? What wou'd She suffer, sentenc'd to submit, From all his Pride of Sense, and Spleen of Wit? Or grant such Trials, as Griselda ran, May show, that Woman is the Slave of Man; Say, might not these for any Wife suffice? What cou'd a harden'd Husband more devise? To Try her Faith? Her Constancy to prove? Great, You must own, her Patience, and her Love. But 'tis a Truth the Sex need not be told, That Men are model'd in a various Mold. And Some, as old and new Experience finds, Indued with most perverse unyielding Minds. In These, whatever Sense first strikes their Thought, (Or wrong or right) th' Impression deep is wrought; Dying, They keep the first Resolves They make, Bound to Opinion, as a Bear to Stake. If properly the Object strikes his Sight, 'Tis great good Luck, the Obstinate goes right. But sure the Chance is more than equal found, That wrong He goes, yet travels round and round. Submit, intreat, diversify, explain, Inlarge, confirm, confute: The Task is vain. To satisfy the Purport of his Will, Th' Event must follow, be it Good or Ill! Twice, from the Nuptial Day, sev'n Years were told, And twice seven Years the Nuptial Trials hold. Each Proof severe, Griselda firmly pass'd, Yet One remain'd behind, the Worst, tho' Last. A Doubt, He rais'd, and nourish'd in his Breast; Nor, till He found the Truth, cou'd think of Rest. “There are (He judg'd) a Race of selfish Mind, “That own no Tie of Nature, or of Kind. “Who rigidly their Breasts to Others steel; “Yet, for Themselves, most sensibly They feel. “Such hear, with equal Ease, the parting Groan “Of Them They never knew, or long have known. “And view the Wreck, without Distress or Care, “Of Those that bore Them, or of Those They bear. “No Partner, They, of joint Affection, own; “Their Pleasure, and their Pain is Self alone. “And such She is, or what, I'm yet to learn!— “Hence, her Submission! Hence, her Unconcern! “If try'd in Self, She ends as She began, “She must be more than Woman, more than Man!” Thus He; such early Prejudice He nurst; That the last Trial but includes the first. For This, a Messenger to Rome He sent, (Now was the Time to give the Scruple Vent.) In legal Phrase, the Marriage to annull, And counterfeit in Form the Papal Bull. His hasty Passions to this Course incline, The shortest Way to answer his Design. “Take, for your Plan, some old Pontific Frame; “Fashion'd anew, the Use will be the same.” At Rome, the Messenger arriv'd, and sped; A forging Hand, He found, and scheming Head. Nor well cou'd fail in that prolific Court, Where Surrogates, Scribes, Proctors, Priests, resort. Twas model'd, Like to Like, and Word for Word; He sends a formal Copy to his Lord: Who, as He us'd on Points of high Debate, Conven'd all Orders that compos'd the State. Summon'd, They meet; The Prince assumes the Throne: Then thus, with sterner Brow, and haughtier Tone. “Content, as fortunate, in Single Life, “You forc'd Me on that dang'rous Rock, a Wife! “A Wife I chose, (nor now disguise the Truth) “From Heat of Blood, th' Intemperance of Youth. “One, whose excelling Form my Passion mov'd, “I lov'd; and All seem'd Right, because I lov'd. “No other was my Motive, or my Aim, “I neither sought your Interest, nor my Fame. “My riper Age this Folly wou'd attone, “Strength to your State, and Lustre to my Throne, “I wou'd acquire, in Kindred Grandeur ty'd; “The Fair, to great Peganus, near ally'd. “For This, the Papal Chair our Envoy moves, “The State will sanction, what the Church approves. A long and hoarse Applause th' Assembly roars, Like rolling Waves that murmur to the Shores. These, Slaves by Nature, born to bear the Rod, Swallow'd his Words, as Oracles from God. Those, from long Habit, custom'd to the Bit, Their Duty thought, to hear and to submit. Others, approv'd It not, yet not withstood, From frigid Virtue, indolently good. But Some, from sordid, or ambitious Views, Prais'd the Design, and pray'd, “No Time He'd lose.” And so had acted, was the Case his own, And good Gualtherus sentenc'd from the Throne. Yet Some, of nobler Soul, but These were few, Place all Griselda's Merit full in View; Her Worth, of Private and of Public Kind, Her blameless Conduct, and unerring Mind. And with bold Truth, and gen'rous Ardor plead, Th' Injustice, and Dishonor of the Deed. Tho' Prince and Subject join'd their gen'ral Voice, No Pow'r cou'd authorise the guilty Choice. Let Pope and Synod their whole Strength unite, That which is Wrong, They never cou'd make Right. “Repudiate, without Cause, the faultless Dame? “'Twas Tyranny! It soil'd a Life of Fame! “They humbly differ'd, and the harsh Divorce “They cou'd not counsel! 'Twas an Act of Force!” Here, rising, “'Tis my Will, (He said) Withdraw”— Nor till that Hour had urg'd his Will for Law. Meantime, the trusty Guard returns from Rome; And all Saluzzo mourns Griselda's Doom. None penetrate the Fraud, or doubt a Wile, So was It fram'd in true Pontific Stile! So fraught with Church Sufficiency and Pride. And thus the Apostolic Roll imply'd. “That He, the Delegate of God, the Pope, “Their Heav'nly Guide, and their Terrestrial Hope, “In kind Compliance to his Son's Request, “(Weighing the People's Good, and Prince's Rest) “Did, and Hereby, Authority had giv'n, “(In Virtue of his Right deriv'd from Heav'n) “To nullify the Marriage from that Hour, “Save, to the Wife whate'er She brought in Dow'r; “With sundry meanless Items, queint and old; “So sign'd! So seal'd! So witness'd! So inroll'd!—” To this, was added, for the Subject's Ease, A Load of Pardons, and at mod'rate Fees. Handed from Heav'n the Scrole, the Croud believ'd; To Slav'ry prone, and form'd to be deceiv'd. Moles, that in Darkness center'd their Delight! The Day, to Them, had been a Pain of Sight! “The Pope, infallible, with one Accord, “They held, nor less infallible their Lord. “For what their Lord requir'd, the Pope allow'd.” Take but in largest Sense the Term of Croud! Nor try'd by Fortune, nor by Birth defin'd, But Honesty of Heart, and Worth of Mind. Without these Qualities, let Princes know, They are themselves the Vulgar, and the Low. The rude Saluzzians swallow'd all the Bait, (I mean the Number of the Small and Great) “In Heav'n, They own'd all Marriages were made, “Yet was the Prince by Heat of Youth betray'd. “If then contracted Parties disagree, “Apply to Whom, but Him that keeps the Key? “What other Pow'r cou'd finish the Debate, “And shut and ope the Matrimonial Gate?” There wanted not, in all her Doubts and Fears, Some to convince Griselda's Eyes and Ears. Prompt to insinuate what the Prince intends, (And These, the formost of her Female Friends) With cruel Pity They lament her Fate, “So alter'd He, and so estrang'd of Late!’ Others, maliciously, to hurt her Rest, Who thought in Silence They had read her Breast, “Urge the Barbarity, that cou'd destroy, “By Turns, the lovely Girl, and hopeful Boy.” Others, to like Humanity inclin'd, “Hint at the Bride, and the Divorce design'd; “And were They bound to lead so curst a Life, “Wou'd rather be the Relict, than the Wife!” To This, She own'd, “Appearances were strong, “But yet, She cou'd not think He cou'd do Wrong.” What Force of Virtue cou'd the Shock sustain? Love, so severely try'd, yet try'd in vain! And, tho' her Looks no Change unusual show, Full deep her Heart, I deem, was charg'd with Woe. But, humble tho' her Birth, her Soul was great; Form'd to indure the worst Extreme of Fate: Fix'd, from his Pleasure, never to depart, To Whom, She gave her Innocence, and Heart. Free was her Breast from Sighs, her Face from Tears, Tho' well confirm'd th' unwelcome News She hears; Knows, on what Message, and with what Intent, The frequent Envoys to Bulogna went. Where rich Peganus rul'd with peaceful Sword, Whose Wife was Sister to her faithless Lord. This Princess, with humaner Talents blest, A Mind, resplendent as her State, possess'd. To learn her Manners, foreign Dames resort; The Virtues, not the Vices, of a Court. Among the Rest, a Maid excelling fair, Was still distinguish'd with peculiar Care, Bred from an Infant, tho' of Birth unknown, The Royal Pair respect Her as their own. And Her, 'twas rumor'd, on his Change of Life, The Marquis of Saluzzo chose for Wife; To dignify his State, adorn his Bed: And wide the Fame malicious Echo spred. “That now Griselda must resign her Claim, “For from Bulogna a new Consort came; “Bright as the Sun, and youthful as the Day, “With splendid Equipage, and rich Array. “The great Peganus, to augment her State, “With all his noble Lords in Order wait; “The Kindred Maid respectfully to guide, “And Her young Brother, riding by her Side: “Who to Saluzzo shap'd direct their Way, “The distant Journey lessening, Day by Day.” Say, was not This sufficient to molest?— The hard Gualtherus might have spar'd the Rest. Thro' Silence some Humanity had shone, Pity might lessen Wrong, tho' not atone. But He, when full the Court, to tempt Her more, Thus spoke, in boist'rous Terms, unus'd before. “Not much displeas'd, tho' chose from humble Life, “I saw You fill the Station of a Wife. “Not for your Beauty, Birth, or Wealth, or Youth. “But for your Duty, Faith, and Love, and Truth. “Yet, now I find, by sad Experience wise, “That in great Lordship, greater Slav'ry lies. “To This conspir'd my Fortune and my Fate; “Tho' Prince, yet lowest Vassal in the State. “Debarr'd, where ev'ry Swain may use his Voice, “Freedom of Will, and Liberty of Choice. “A Wife to wed, the Public Care ordains, “And now, to quit that wedded Wife constrains; “A new, is sought: Nor is the rising Flood “Of factious Discontent, to be withstood. “For This, full Pow'r to loose my former Vows, “Th' indulgent Father of the Church allows. “And a new Bride is chose, and on the Way, “To obviate all Suspense, and all Delay. “Be strong of Heart, and void anon the Place. “Yet This I grant You. Take it as a Grace. “All that You brought Me, on the Nuptial Hour, “I grant You. Take it All! That Princely Dow'r! “But well wou'd You observe, What I advise; “Know, They, can never fall, that never rise. “Then chuse an Equal, on the peaceful Plains, “And live the little Princess of the Swains! “Lost to a Palace, in a Cottage rest. “None may presume, for ever to be Blest. “Yet, this Celestial Gift to All is sent, “To bear the Stroke of Fortune with Content.” “I am not now to learn (She strait replies) “The wond'rous Distance that between Us lies. “Me, not your partial Choice, cou'd worthy make, “To share your Grandeur, or your Bed partake. “Yet if this House, (as Heav'n may Witness bear) “I enter'd Wife, I liv'd not Mistress there. “As best became, I study'd to behave, “As One, above your Slaves, your humblest Slave. “That there so long, I held the foremost Place, “I think it not my Merit, but your Grace. “And if a fitter Consort You require, “Content, to my Paternal Cot retire; “Humbly to dwell, where humbly I was bred: “Nor share your Grandeur, nor partake your Bed. “There, clean of Heart, the Widow, as the Bride, “Will live, if not to You, to None ally'd. “Nor shall it be my Blot, while Life remain, “To soil your Choice by any vulgar Stain. “That once You deign'd to join Me to your Side; “This Thought let Me indulge of Royal Pride. “This single Thought! May Heav'n propitious grant, “In Her You chuse, the Wealth and Birth I want. “Pleas'd, for your Good, the Station to resign, “That was my Bliss, that once, my Lord, was Thine. “Thence, priz'd by Me. Disturb'd if I depart, “'Tis not, to lose your Fortune, but your Heart. “Such Dow'r You proffer Me as first I brought; “Those rustic Weeds! Yet where may Those be sought? “Well I remember, on the Nuptial Hour, “With Scorn, You threw aside that wretched Dow'r. “Far other then, your Gesture, and your Mind! “In Look, how gentle! And in Speech, how kind! “But I have heard, and prov'd the Saying true; “Love is not, when 'tis old, what 'twas when new. “Yet, shall no Fear of Death constrain my Will, “(Death the last Line of Human Good and Ill!) “Low as I fall, at Fortune to repine, “Proud of the Thought, that once your Heart was mine. “Then, when You rais'd your Vassal to your Breast, “And rudely clad before, full richly dress'd; “Obedient Duty, and unspotted Fame, “Was all I brought. No other Dow'r I claim. “But why recall to Mind that blissful Day? “You wish It had not been, and I obey. “Then down I lay this Scepter from my Hand, “(Here, never borne, as Symbol of Command!) “Cast, from my Head, this decorated Crown, “And from my Body, loose this ermin'd Gown. “And last this Ring, (This last let me restore!) “What, with unwearied Constancy I wore. “Lodg'd, in the Stores, the Rest your Orders wait; “Your Gifts of Love! Or Ornaments of State! “Naked I came, and naked I return, “Nor must I, since It suits your Grandeur, mourn. “This only let me beg, nor beg in vain, “For What I brought, and never can regain! “For all my Duty, Faith, and Love, and Truth! “Untainted Chastity! Unpractis'd Youth! “Years, that I pass'd! And Children that I bore! “(The last unguarded Words She hurried o'er.) “Grant me such Cloaths as fit Griselda best, “A Common Garment, and a Rustic Vest. “An Outcast let me be. Yet This I pray, “Let me not, like a Worm, go by the Way; “The People's Laughter, and their Lord's Disgrace. “For this may cast below my Servile Race! “Below her State, that once was call'd your Wife! “None, with Immodesty, can tax my Life.” With Dignity unalter'd This She said, Her Cheeks alone effus'd a warmer Red. Compos'd, tho' pain'd! Determin'd, tho' distrest! The Prince was mov'd, as every Eye confess'd. “Your Vest Retain” (impassion'd He reply'd) “But quit all other Marks of stately Pride.” He cou'd no more.—His Voice its Utt'rance lost, And this last Proof He tempted to his Cost. Silent He stood, with agitated Breast; But his Look witness'd many a Sigh supprest. Yet Tears wou'd flow, a voluntary Tide, And These He strove, and strove in vain to hide. His Heart, against his stubborn Will, conspir'd; Aside, He turn'd; and hastily, retir'd. Her Condescension struck so strong a Light; It fill'd the Court with Horror and Affright, “May I be never to such Ill betray'd!” In Silence sigh'd the unexperienc'd Maid. Each Widow, to her Secret Friend, alone, Whisper'd, “Thus treated, He had had his own.” And ev'ry Wife attested Earth and Heav'n, “Twas a mean Act, a bad Example giv'n! And ancient Maid, with ancient Maid began; “How great our 'Scape, Who never yet knew Man!” Meantime Griselda secretly withdrew, And disarray'd Her, safe from public View. Conforming, far as Decency allow'd, She shun'd the Noble and Ignoble Croud. All, that She cou'd, She left of her Attire, And no Intrusion furth'ring her Desire; The Postern Gate She pass'd, the publick Street With naked Head She gain'd, and naked Feet. But soon the Croud her noted Form descry'd, And pour'd before, behind, on ev'ry Side. Down hast Thou laid, in vain hast Thou laid down, Thy Robe, thy Ring, thy Scepter, and thy Crown! Stript of thy State, thy native State They find; Grandeur of Mein! And Majesty of Mind! Exil'd in Thee, thy Exile They attend; The Friendless, that, in Thee, still found a Friend! The Motherless, that met a Mother's Care! For 'twas thy Good, thy Good with all to share! Hence, bare-foot as She trod the flinty Road, Their Vestments o'er the rugged Way They strow'd. And not one Breast refus'd a pitying Sigh; Void of a Tear was not one melting Eye; Grief in each Voice, and Face, exprest, and shown! In ev'ry Voice and Face, except her own! Tho' loud They spred her Praise, and urg'd her Wrong; She curb'd Resentment, and restrain'd her Tongue! Silent She mov'd, majestically slow, As One, in Pain that pleasur'd, joy'd in Woe! But wicked Fame precedes with nimbler Tread, The Father reaching in his homely Sted. And tho' the long Neglect, Year after Year, Had caus'd Him many a Sigh, and many a Tear. Never to touch the Court on Pain enjoin'd; Whence, proud, He thought, his Prince, or Child, unkind! Yet musing with himself, full oft He said; “By Force of Love, Gualtherus was misled, “That Fire once cool'd, his Lust will yield to Pride, “And the Wife fall a Victim to the Bride.” Tho' Length of Time had fortify'd his Breast, The sudden Rumor rous'd Him from his Rest. His Cloaths, from off his aged Breast, He tears, From off his aged Head his hoary Hairs. Devotes the Light, and deprecates the Day, And Life, impairing with too slow Decay. Then seeks, with anxious Care, his Rustic Hoard, Where his fond Heart her Virgin Habit stor'd; Sav'd, to indulge his Mind and to imploy, In pleasing Pain, and melancholy Joy. Now, found of Use! He speeds with feeble Haste, Cover'd his Child, lamented, and imbrac'd. Here, for a Space, remain'd the Patient Wife, And, thrown from great, returns to vulgar Life. Yet never once was heard her Lord to blame, Tho' spirited by many a busy Dame. Above the Pow'r of Fortune, or of Fate, She rose, in Good, or Ill, alike sedate! In Good, against Distress, She arm'd her still, And still prepar'd Her, for Success, in Ill. This was her Character, by All allow'd, “Virtuous, tho' Beautiful! Tho' Great, not Proud! “Discreet, as Witty! Sprightly, as Serene! “Sage, but not Sad! And Humble, but not Mean!” On Job, Priests flourish still, with wond'rous Ease, And Priests on Job may flourish, if They please. We mean not, here, to enter the Dispute. Yet Priests can prove, a Woman is a Brute; And, (when it serves their Turn) a Man, a God: But 'tis the safest Way to kiss the Rod. Yet when the Man of Uz, whose perfect Life They gloss, and blazon the intemp'rate Wife, Who bade Him to his Face, curse God and die; Mean They the Sex? Sure, Priests may err or lye! Yet, not to stab the Church, but gently probe, I say, Griselda far transcended Job! And fast as Men, cou'd Women Texts expound, As many Female Suff'rers wou'd be found! Women than Men, more patient, and more true! This is my Faith,—But then, It holds of Few. Gualtherus, his Emotion, soon repress'd, Resum'd his Mind, and fortify'd his Breast. “Wond'rous her Faith, (He commun'd with his Heart) “Wond'rous her Love, if free from female Art! “To bear submissive, such repeated Wrongs, “That Temper, rarely, to that Sex belongs! “Nor ev'n to seek, from Words, or Sighs Relief! “Was It, Excess of Patience, or of Grief? “Again, not once reproach, not once withstand! “'Twas great Disguise of Soul, or great Command! “Sustain such Weight of Woe with tearless Eyes!— “But, to the Covert, for Relief She flies. “There, doubtless, vents her Rage, and makes her Moan, “Echo, pays Sigh for Sigh, and Groan for Groan. “Then, change the Scene, from Privacy of Place; “Yes, let her see her Rival, Face to Face.” Thus, as He meditates the full Assay, Arriv'd a Courier, and at Prime of Day; To notice: “That the Princely Youth and Dame, “With great Peganus, from Bulogna came. “That, safely They had pass'd the Rocky Way, “And hop'd to reach Him with the Setting Ray. Meantime, the Banish'd Wife, at early Dawn, Unfolds her Flock, and follows to the Lawn; To Where Gualtherus, loit'ring in the Course, First stop'd, from Love, or Failure of his Horse. There, lowly seated on the dewey Ground, She feeds her little Charge, that bleats around; And plies the Distaff, that before her stands: Yet slow, the Widow'd, to the Virgin Hands. For, tho' the Twine with equal Care She wrought, Oft, wou'd intrude, an interrupting Thought; Oft, wou'd her Soul, her former State retrace: “Exalted Honor is a slipp'ry Place! “Tho' Palaces are high, and Cots are low; “Here, lies sure Peace! There, lies destructive Show! “But Mind, is All to All, Mean or Sublime! “Mind, is not to be chang'd, by Place, or Time! “In Time, or Place, Unblest, or Blest can dwell! “Can make a Hell of Heav'n, a Heav'n of Hell!” Thus musing: For the Proof, Gualtherus sends, She, quits the calm Reflexion, and attends; In Dress, a Shepherdess: The same, to see, As on her Marriage Day. She bends her Knee. But He, more slow to raise Her with his Hand, Nods and imparts his last severe Command. “This Day, We celebrate the previous Rite; “Griselda! Know, our Nuptials crown the Night. “Full, to Profusion is the Palace stor'd, “With All, to deck the Bed, or cheer the Board. “Yet much I fear, the Feast may wrong my Soul; “For Execution, mends, or mars the Whole! “Tho' gen'rous the Design, and large the Cost; “All Beauty is in Want of Order lost. “Not One, thro' all Saluzzo, can I find, “That knows, so well, my Manner, or my Mind; “The Guests, or to distinguish, or invite: “Put Show to Use, to Profit turn Delight. “But You, long wont this Station to support, “Can best advise, what suits the Prince and Court. “Again exert the Talents You have shown, “Display, at Large, the Splendor of my Throne; “Add ev'ry outward Instance of my Love: “All, that I might omit, but must approve. “But chiefly turn You to attend the Fair, “Be That your Daily Thought, and Nightly Care. “'Tis True, this Rustic Garb may show Neglect; “But well it suits your State, if You reflect. “For, Pride of Dress, is sure a barren Curse; “E'er Fancy you consult, consult your Purse. “This is my Will. Proceed, without Delay! “And do the proper Honors of the Day! “Much I rejoice (the mild Griselda cries) “That on my Faith your Confidence relies; “And hail the Cause, that brings Me to the Place, “Where oft, at Distance, I may see your Face; “And oft your Voice, with due Attention, hear: “Thus far I may indulge my Eye, and Ear! “In honest Diligence, thro' servile Life, “Pleas'd will I tend the Husband and the Wife. “Assiduous, to prevent what She requires, “Solicitous, to check my own Desires. “So will I act (if but my Heart allows) “As I ne'er knew your Flames, or heard your Vows.” Her Answer half defeated his Design; “Our Confidence You see—the Trust be Thine!” He Said. She mingles with the Menial Train, No Service She neglects, and spares no Pain; To grace the Bed, or magnify the Throne: And forms a Feast more splendid than her own. Intent, or to dispose, or to provide; But pains Her most, for What concern'd the Bride. This done; each noted Chief, each noted Dame, She summons to the Feast; so call'd, They came. These She receives, as suits their Rank or Race; In vulgar Habit, but with noble Grace! Arranging All, (for such her Lord's Desire) From wealthy Citizen to landed 'Squire! Equals in Place, not Worth! From hardy Knight, To Him, that never saw the Face of Fight! From Peer that builds on Ancestors his Fame, To Him, that founds his Title and his Name! From learn'd and just Dispenser of the Laws, To Him, that judges, by the Bribe, the Cause! From Seer, whose Charity gives Health, and Ease, To Him, that poisons, for the Sake of Fees; From Priest, of Life unstain'd, and Zeal sincere, To Him, of Holy Fraud, and pious Leer! Enter, of Good and Bad, a mingled Crew. 'Tis the true State of Things, or Old, or New! Virtue, and Vice, divides each mixt Degree! Such, was the World! And, such, will ever be! But as her Care descends from Bow'r to Hall, All still inspecting, still amending All; Thus to a Maid of Rank, a Wife of Spirit: “Say, in her Meanness, see you any Merit? “I vow, by all the Virtue of my Pride, “Was I Griselda sever'd from his Side; “Then cast, as Handmaid, to a second Wife; “Slave to his Will, yet trusted with his Life, “The present Bondage shou'd redeem the past, “Bridegroom and Bride, this Night shou'd be your last.” Meantime the Foremost of the Train alight; And fast the People pour'd to see the Sight. Close, and more close, the murm'ring Insects grew, Should'ring for Place, and crouding for a View. And much They prais'd the Show, and much the Choice. Ah! Who wou'd rest upon the Public Voice? Griselda's Rise with equal Noise They hail'd; With equal Noise Griselda's Fall bewail'd. Be deaf, fair Stranger, to their senseless Cries, Thus wou'd They treat thy Fall, Who treat thy Rise. “Gualtherus is no Fool (the Croud confess'd) “Changing his Wife, but changing for the Best. “Griselda wants no Merit to ingage, “But fairer, This, and of a softer Age. “Griselda, was inur'd to brook Command, “And so may This, when molded to his Hand. “From her, what Heirs will spring the Throne to Grace? “For She descends from some exalted Race. “The Brother comes, as Sample of the Line; “What Lineaments?—Majestic, and Divine!” O Vulgar Souls, unstable and untrue! Tir'd with the Old, transported with the New! Turn'd by each Blast, as fickle as the Fane! And faster than the Moon, Ye wax, and wain! Hapless the Prince, whose Ear, delighted, draws The Praise of Crouds, and swallows vain Applause; Whose Eye, transported, views the supple Round Of Courtiers, whom He trusts, yet fails to sound. His Ear may be misled, deceiv'd his Eye; Crouds can praise Folly, Courtiers, look a Lye. Safer, the Call of Virtue to pursue, That sep'rates Wrong from Right, and False from True. Tho' Crouds may change, unfaithful as the Wind! Can They depose the Monarc from his Mind? Tho' Courtiers from Allegiance may depart! Great is the Empire of an honest Heart? For inborn Worth, alone, knows no Controul, Fortune may change the State, not change the Soul. But Good, or Ill, as Man pursues or flies, So truly He may fall, so truly rise. 'Tis Virtue gives Him in high Life to shine, Virtue, in low, is an unminted Mine. The Force of Each was in Griselda shown, Great in a Cot, and humble in a Throne! Thus, of the Many mad, the sober Few Adjudg'd; Who lov'd the Old, and fear'd the New. “And Fools, (They call'd the Number) to disown, “For Good They know not yet, a Good long known! In State, She enters now the Palace Gate, And ent'ring is receiv'd with answ'ring State. The Prince descending fast, to meet the Bride, A Dame of high Condition join'd his Side; Tongue of the Sex, She fastens on his Ear, And thus express'd her fashionable Fear. “A Shepherdess, She said, is such a Sight, “It soils the Splendor of the Nuptial Rite; “Excuse me, 'tis not my peculiar Plea, “Here all the Sex in one Request agree; “We make it our Petition and Desire, “Griselda may redress Her, or retire; “Nor stand, to Foreign Lords, a Mark of Sport, “And Scandal to the Ladies of the Court. Nought, to his Scheme, so cross as this Request. He veil'd the Truth, and gloss'd it with a Jest. Known was the Dame, to love supreme Command, And hold the Bridle with a steddy Hand. “Ought to the Fair, it grieves me to refuse, “But 'tis too Late, another Course to chuse. “Griselda's inward Merit well You know; “And what is Dress, but a fictitious Show? “Yet, seek You, why to Court thus rudely brought? “Young is our Bride, and should be mildly taught. “This rural Garb is Humble, and is Plain; “In Public shown, this Maxim to maintain. “Plain Truth, and humble Duty, suits a Wife; “An Emblem, for the Conduct of her Life! I pass, as Trivial, nor the Tale prolong, With Masque or Dance, with Minstrelsy or Song. Nor, drawn by Fancy, deviate from the Way, For kind Reception here, there grand Array. I leave each Train, their Princes at their Head; The Youth and Virgin by Peganus led: Whom, long, Gualtherus fasten'd to his Breast, And All, and Each, with kindred Warmth caress'd. I dwell not on the Maid, in fresh Fifteen, Whether array'd in White, Red, Blue, or Green. Nor count how promising the Boy appears, How Manly, measuring Half his Sister's Years. Here glean, ye Bards, who barren Subjects chuse; Griselda will admit no wand'ring Muse. Short of her Virtues, tho' thy Numbers flow, Muse, keep Her First in Sight, tho' Last in Show. Her copious Mind makes All her single Care; But most She strives to serve, and joy the Fair. Natives or Strangers, pleas'd and proud to see; The Whole She ranges, Each in his Degree. The foreign Lords a due Surprise express, So much, her Manner supersedes her Dress. Nor stints her Tongue the Youth and Maid to raise With Praise well judg'd; For they deserv'd her Praise: Tho' not to Flatt'ry vile her Words descend, No flatt'ring Courtier cou'd her Words amend. A gen'rous Flow of Soul, that scorn'd all Art! Unsoil'd by Envy! Genuine, from the Heart! Some Worth it argues, a Friend's Worth to know; Virtue, to own the Virtue of a Foe. Now, was the Hour, the Guests to entertain, And, One by One, precedes the Houshold Train. Just, at that Season, e'er the Board was crown'd, While All prepar'd to join the Social Round; Gualtherus turns, Griselda to explore: “Seek Her,” He said; But sent his Eyes before. And where He spy'd Her busy'd in the Hall, “Attend,” He calls; And She attends his Call. “Griselda,” (with Indiff'rence feign'd He said) “You see the Maid I chuse, and mean to wed. “Speak (He continued with a Face of Sport) “What think You of our Bride? Make just Report. “How to her Form, how to her Worth, inclin'd? “Pass Sentence, on her Person, and her Mind!” She, mildly took the Word, and strait reply'd; “Ill tho' the Relict might commend the Bride, “No Malice of the Sex, no Spleen of Wrong, “My Mind shall bias, or mislead my Tongue. “Never these Eyes, in perfect Age, cou'd trace, “A juster Form, or yet a fairer Face. “Never, from Youth imperfect, heard these Ears, “Thoughts so exprest, the Words of ripen'd Years “Base is the Office, wrongly to debase; “Lessen her Worth, I rise not in her Place. “With Truth I praise Her, and without Design; “Her Want of Merit, wou'd not add to mine. “What, fully She exacts, I freely give; “And may, Each blest in Each, securely live!” Thus as She spoke; Warm grew the Virgin's Face, Rosy her Breast. She blush'd with modest Grace. Then back retir'd, by her own Praise subdu'd. Griselda seiz'd th' Occasion, and pursu'd. “This, let Me add, by long Experience wife, “And once presume Gualtherus to advise. “Judge ne'er so hardly of our Sex or Life, “Ill Usage may pervert, not mend, a Wife. “When from the Bounds of Reason Men depart, “What, but the Force of Truth, and Faith of Heart, “Retains Affection, too severely prov'd? “Twice, think not, to be so indur'd, and lov'd. “Try not, as me You try'd, this tender Maid, “To summon more than Virtue to her Aid. “If I, to Pain was senseless, deaf to Mirth, “I owe It to the Lowness of my Birth. “The Hand to Labour us'd, the Heart, to Care, “Ills I had borne, and Ills cou'd know to bear. “But She was nobly born, and fondly fed! “In Plenty nurtur'd, and in Grandeur bred! “Not like Griselda rais'd from low Degree; “By Thee to be debas'd, prefer'd by Thee! “She, in the Trust of Innocence and Youth, “Nor doubts your Constancy, nor fears your Truth. “Soon wou'd She feel Distress, soon find a Cure; “She cou'd not well Adversity indure; “Well, cou'd She not, such Load of Grief, sustain: “For Death wou'd soon arrive, and ease her Pain.” She spoke, from inward Ties of Kindred Blood, Or nobler Sympathy of Good to Good; Firm as a Column, stable as a Wall: Her Grandeur more conspicuous by her Fall. The gen'rous Answer, free from Spleen or Art, Rose inly on his Mind, and fill'd his Heart. “Too far, too far, (In Extasy He cry'd) “Griselda, was thy Wifely Virtue try'd. “Resume thy wonted State, thy wonted Cheer “Resume; nor think Me faithless, tho' severe! “Enough have I assay'd thy Love and Truth; “Assay'd, to riper Age from tender Youth; “So well, as never Wife, in Pomp array'd, “Or clad in Poverty, was yet assay'd.” He said, and by his Side Griselda plac'd, Fast seiz'd Her in his Arms, and long imbrac'd. As One, from cumb'rous Sleep disturb'd, She seems, Doubtful, if yet She wakes, or still She dreams; If real Forms stand obvious to her Sight, Or float the airy Shadows of the Night. He noted her Confusion, Silence broke, And gently press'd her Hand and kindly spoke. “By Him, I swear, for Man that bled and dy'd, “Thou art my Wife, I seek no other Bride. “Worthy thy Praise the Maid I must agree; “Must joy to praise Her,—For she comes from Thee. “And Thee, in Her, thro' all her Form I trace, “May She, in Soul, but match Thee as in Face! “Thrice five Years told (if Love not blind these Eyes) “States all the Diff'rence that between You lies; “In Age or Beauty. Oh! that Heav'n decreed, “Her Virtue to thy Virtue might succeed. “Thy Daughter This, first Object of thy Care! “And That thy Son, Saluzzo's future Heir! “Assassin'd? No! Not such our base Intent. “Safe were the Infants to Bulogna sent; “To good Peganus privily convey'd: “His worthy Consort rais'd the Youth and Maid. “That here They stand thus honor'd in thy View, “Say, to his gen'rous Heart, what Thanks are due? “That, in thy View, thus polish'd, here they stand, “What Thanks are due to her reforming Hand? “A second Mother She, at our Desire, “Conceal'd their Birth; He prov'd a second Sire. “My Motive, was Mistrust; To own the Truth: “A stubborn Prejudice, imbib'd in Youth! “Wedlock, I judg'd, a Station of Unrest; “I found no marry'd Pair compleatly Blest: “And for the Male, too hasty to decide, “Plac'd ev'ry Error on the Female Side. “I thought your Failures to our Faults gave Rise, “Your Folly, Falseness, Levity, or Vice. “Hence, the first Trial, hence arose the last. “But well the Future shall amend the Past. “Hence was you sworn a Life submiss to lead, “Nor swerve in Thought or Look, in Word or Deed. “Hence, with our Daughter when constrain'd to part, “I held your Duty, Indolence or Art. “Hence, was the Son propos'd. The Son resign'd: “This Proof of Love, seem'd Cruelty of Mind. “Hence, was You try'd in Self. With honest Shame, “I own the Crime: Griselda was the same. “But fixt Suspicion is the worst of Woes, “And Nought but Certainty cou'd bring Repose. “Let Malice, (Room there is) our Conduct blame, “Yet my Severity shall raise your Fame. “And cou'd You penetrate my inmost Breast, “There wou'd You find indelibly exprest, “Griselda fills my Heart. My Wealth, her Gain. “My Bliss, her Pleasure. Her Distress, my Pain. “And when most calm her Breast, serene her Eye; “Here, many a Tear She caus'd, here many a Sigh: “And let This mitigate, if not atone, “Each Trial was not Thine, It was my own. “And if thy Virtue thus exalted shine, “Thine is the Treasure, the Discov'ry Mine.” She that cou'd bear Misfortune, that had borne, Each Infant from her tender Bosom torne! Cou'd to a Cottage from a Throne descend, And, the great Bed, She had adorn'd, attend. From Low to High, from High to Low re-tost, Cou'd see, whate'er on Earth She valu'd, lost. She that cou'd stand the last Contempt unmov'd, Yields to the Yielding of the Man She lov'd. Sinks at the Thought of either Child restor'd, Whose Loss in Secrecy She long deplor'd. Patient in Ill, in Injury resign'd! Here first She quits Equality of Mind. While, all her Wish in her Possession stood. Fast flow'd her Joy, like the returning Flood. The Swell of Passion rose to such a Height, 'Twas painful Pleasure, and severe Delight. Kind as He spoke, with Rapture and Amaze, Her Eyes She gives upon her Lord to gaze. And quits but to survey, with silent Joy, The lovely Maid and near-resembling Boy. All moves her, that She heard, or that She view'd; Strong on her Soul the Tides of Joy intrude. Fain wou'd her Tongue have open'd all her Breast; But there She felt, what cou'd not be exprest; Vain the Indeavor. For in Transport tost Her Voice was stopt, her Breath in Rapture lost. Wound to Excess of Gratitude and Love, Her Pulse forgot to play, her Heart to move. No more her Form the vital Heat retains, Slow pass'd the Current circling in her Veins. The Dews of Death her trembling Limbs assail. Her Lips grew livid, and her Cheeks grew pale. Sounds, disproportion'd to her Thoughts, She hears; Unmeaning Murmurs echoing thro' her Ears. While misty Vapors, that in Fancy rise, Cloud the sole Objects that cou'd charm her Eyes. She faints. She falls. But, sinking to the Ground, He caught her in his Arms. The Court surround. Ye tender Youth, in Love Unblest, or Blest, Imagination lose, and paint the Rest! Virtuous or Vitious, be your Course of Life, Feel you no Pain, for Husband or for Wife? Reclining on his Breast, She pants for Breath; As pleas'd to die, since there She found her Death. He looks the Aid, He wants the Pow'r to give; As in her Life alone He wish'd to live. A gen'ral Care the Courtly Train confess, Joy mixt with Sorrow, Pleasure with Distress. These fan'd her Bosom, Those her Head sustain'd; While Death o'er Life a doubtful Conquest gain'd. Of Art and Nature ev'ry Aid They bring; The cool Refreshment of the limpid Spring! The Juice of Herbs, that noxious Steams repell! Of Shrubs the Virtues, elegant of Smell! Of Drugs and Simples the salubrious Pow'rs! Extract of Salts, and Quintessence of Flow'rs! Thrice seem'd her Eyes, to ask the Cheer of Light, Thrice seem'd to sink in everlasting Night. And thrice He hail'd her as restor'd from Death, Thrice wail'd her irrecoverable Breath. At length She mov'd, and wildly gazing round, First in her Care the pleas'd Gualtherus found; Next, weeping o'er Her, joy'd the Maid to see, And last the Boy, that trembled at her Knee. The fond Assemblage pour'd, without Controul, On her weak Sense, and mollify'd her Soul. By Turns She seiz'd them, and by Turns She press'd, The Father and the Children to her Breast. Adown their Cheeks the mingling Torrents flow, The Streams of Transport, not the Streams of Woe. The sweet Contagion spred like tainted Air; From Youth to Youth it pass'd, from Fair to Fair. And many a gen'rous Heart breath'd many a Sigh, And many a Tear shed many a gentle Eye. A Scene so sweetly sad, Who fail'd to feel, Must have an Eye of Flint, or Heart of Steel. Long Silence follow'd. 'Twas not Time for Speech. Looks best explain, what Words want Pow'r to reach. Mirth to restore, Gualtherus soon began, Ironically grave; for that the Man. “A Shepherdess is such an aukward Foil, “The Splendor of the Feast She needs must soil. “That She shou'd change her Garb, on me you call; “And I agree; for 'tis the Plea of all. “Ladies, with Joy I grant you this Request, “Yes! Let our Wife retire to be re-drest. “Nor stand to Foreign Lords a Mark of Sport, “Or Scandal to the Beauties of the Court.” Pleas'd, She retir'd. For well She read his Mind. A Train of busy Females flock behind. And now more busy None of all the Train, Than Some that witness'd Pleasure in her Pain; But She that Office to the Bridal Maid Assigns, nor wish'd, nor wanted, other Aid. The Maiden Bride was charm'd with the Imploy, The Sun, She knew, must set in Grief or Joy; Late made no Stranger to her Sire's Intent: And, as She griev'd, she joy'd for the Event. Soon was She disarray'd, and soon attir'd, For there lay All or More than Dress requir'd; All that cou'd wish the Vain, or ask the Great, In Aid of Beauty, or in Pride of State. Nor senseless of their Value was the Dame; Not senseless! when She thought, from whom they came. Strait She return'd, Resplendent to behold; Of Silver was her Vest, her Robe of Gold. The Hoards of Ages, that her Crown compos'd, Took Lustre from the Tresses they inclos'd. High in the Seat of Honor was She plac'd; The Seat her Virtue fill'd, and Beauty grac'd! The Guests, in Order rang'd, the Prince addrest, And with a noble Freedom op'd his Breast. A gen'rous Sense of Shame unloos'd his Tongue; The Wise and Brave dares say, that He was wrong: If Virtue errs, She errs against her Rules; 'Tis ever the Reverse with Knaves or Fools: For wilful Faults, These mend not, or not own; Too weak to see, or wicked to atone! “Friends! to the Self-accus'd be not Unkind; “Full dear I nourish'd this Distrust of Mind. “Painful the Trial, as severe the Test; “Had the Wife fall'n, the Husband was Unblest. “Be her's the Honor; mine be the Disgrace; “Yet shall my Choice beam Glory on my Race. “Nor Friend, nor Foe, that Act of Life shall blame; “That was my own; and is my Praise, not Shame. “First, that beneath low Birth, and mean Disguise, “Beauty and Virtue cou'd not 'scape my Eyes. “Next, that I held Gentility of Blood “Consists, in Scorn of Ill, and Pride of Good. “Last, that I prov'd, Worth equal, whence it springs! “From Cots of Swains, or Palaces of Kings! “Remains there Ought, Griselda can desire? “Yes, much is due to her neglected Sire. “What must the Good Janicola have borne, “To think his Worth the Object of our Scorn? “What, not indur'd from Solitary Life? “What, not expect the Father for the Wife? “To give his innate Virtue full Support, “Be mine the Care; He will not shame the Court “Here, shall he bear the Rank his Merit gains, “Example, to our Nobles, and our Swains!” Peganus, by their mutual Virtues won, Strait ask'd the blooming Daughter for his Son. With which Gualtherus gracefully comply'd; “If so my Son might call your Daughter Bride.” Ask You, how led the younger Race their Lives? Just as They shou'd. Mere Husbands and mere Wives! At Rule, the Women neither aim'd, nor broke Their Vow; with equal Neck They bore the Yoke. The Men accus'd Them not of Crimes unknown; But pard'ning lighter Faults, excus'd their own. Thus found that mournful Day a blisful End; In Mirth and Revel the glad Night They spend. Short seem'd the Hours of Converse and Delight, Ev'n Day impertinently rose on Night. The coldest Maids, and wildest Youths confess'd, So to be Join'd, was, doubly to be Blest! With Licence, All their various Censure pass'd, Some the first Marriage prais'd, and Some the last. The Pair, of Last or First, no Diff'rence make; Still, one in Soul, tho' sunder'd by Mistake. Each wrapt in Each, the Concord They improve; Their Life, was one long Day, of Harmony and Love. End of the Clerk of Oxford's Tale. CONCLUSION TO THE CLERK of Oxford's TALE. I mean not, by this Tale, I must declare, What Husbands shou'd exact, or Wives shou'd bear. That Sense wou'd much my gen'rous Master wrong; For thus Petrarch has moraliz'd the Song. Ye Fair! Without Offence, let Truth be told; This Age is not so strong as was the Old. The Proof You cou'd not suffer, if you wou'd; Too much for Human Flesh, and Human Blood. Yet Patience is a Good, of Use in Life, To Youth, or Maid! to Husband, or to Wife! A Virtue, to no Sex, or Age, confin'd! Our Author wou'd extend it to Mankind. For if such Trials bore, such Hazards ran, (Mere Force of Love!) a Woman for a Man; Shall I presume to question his Decree? By Whom, I am! In Whom, I hope to Be! Vice luring, in the Way of Virtue, lies. God suffers This; but tempts not: tho' He tries. Go Wrong, or Right, 'tis your own Action still; He leaves You to your Choice, of Good, or Ill. Then chuse the Good! The Ill submissly bear! The Man of Virtue is above Despair. Safe, on this Maxim, with Griselda rest! That All, that fortunes, fortunes for the Best! Chaucer, who close attended, from the Ground His musing Eyes up-rais'd, and look'd around. “Spare me (He cry'd) if not our Host oppose, “One Word of Epilogue, before you close. “So rare a Coin, are true Griseldas grown, “Scarce Two are found, in any Country Town. “And bold the Man, not wise, that dares ingage “To warrant One, in London, in an Age. “For put the Current Cash to full Assay, “The Gold is mix'd with Brass; a bad Alay! “And shou'd it stand the Touch, or cheat the Eye; “Trust me, at last, 'twill rather break than ply. “Hence, let our Pray'rs the Wife of Bath befriend, “Whose Life, and Sect, ye Pow'rs of Love defend. “Still may her Tongue the sov'reign Rule maintain; “And never may her Hand relax the Rein. “Free may she live, in undisturb'd Delight, “All Day in Revel, and in Bliss all Night. “Nor will the Modest Scholar think me bold; “(Who with much Decency much Truth has told) “Or will with me, as with mine Host dispense; “(For no light Humor takes from solid Sense) “If this Advice I add, to poise the Scale: “A merry Moral suits a serious Tale. “Dead, is, Griselda! Wifly Patience, Dead! “Both bury'd in one Tomb! Both laid in Lead! “For which, ye Husbands, lend attentive Ear; “Hear me, for it concerns You much to hear. “Let None, I warn You, None on Pain of Life, “In Search of a Griselda, tempt his Wife. “If half so far, her Patience You assail; “You try Her, to your Loss, for She will fail. “And You, ye Wives of Spirit, above Wrongs, “Let no such mean Example nail your Tongues. “Let, never, moral Poet of your Age, “Fill, with your Duty, one Romantic Page. “Be Pleasure, your Pursuit! Be Pow'r, your Aim! “Make Nothing, of your Virtue, or your Fame! “Of Truth and Honor, laugh at All he writes; “Vain Talk for Children! Nurs'ry Cant of Sprites! “Thus taught; no Merit in Compliance place! “Meanness of Soul, think, Modesty of Face! “It matters not, how tender, when alone, “The Part'ner of thy Life. It shou'd be known! “Known to thy Friends! nor yet shou'd That suffice. “To Strangers be it known! Might I advise. “And now imprint this Lesson on your Mind, “The Benefit, by Practice, you will find. “Trust not the Marriage Venture to his Hand; “Freight He the Frigate, Thou the Sail command! “Why, to his blustry Oath, such Def'rence paid? “The Husband, why thus dreaded and obey'd? “Arm'd, tho' He stood, compleat in plated Mail; “The Arrows of thy Quiver shall not fail. “Thy crabbed Eloquence supplies a Dart, “That, ent'ring at his Ear, shall pierce his Heart. “If You have Beauty, strait alarm his Love. “Be ever on the Dress, and on the Rove. “At Home wou'd He remain? Abroad then roam! “Then, wou'd He roam Abroad? Remain at Home! “Make it your Rule, to see, and to be seen; “Abroad in Humor! And at Home in Spleen! “Touch but his Jealousy, You must prevail! “Yes! You will make him couch like any Quail! “The Pow'r of Form, if Nature has deny'd; “Tho' not his Love, You may alarm his Pride. “Be open of your House, to sup, or dine, “Bring Company; for All he has is Thine! “To Fiddlers, Priests, Play'rs, Poets, give or lend! “Money shall win Thee many an humble Friend! “Thy Man, may fume, and fret, and rave, and rail! “But touch his Honor, and You low'r his Sail. “For You, the Masculine, to Labor bred, “When menaces his Hand, correct his Head. “If Nature gives the Sinew and the Frame, “Same as the Pow'r, why not the Use the same? “Whene'er your Wish, is wilfully withstood, “Exert your Talent; it will do him Good. “Stick to your Point! Again withstood, withstand! “There is no Logic, like a heavy Hand. “But for the Delicate, the Weak in Fight, “The Rich, the Great, the Tender, the Polite! “Be furious as a Tiger! or if That “You cannot compass; vixin as a Cat! “By Tongue reclaim this Rebel to your Will! “Loud as the Clapper of a Drudging Mill! “Fast as the Flier of a well-order'd Jack “From Morn to Night keep one continu'd Clack! “And went He twice as loud, and twice as fast, “Speak what He will, like Echo, speak the last.” The worthy Student, to Scholastic Pride A Stranger, smil'd; but not a Word reply'd. Not so mine Host the sly Conclusion bore, Roundly he spoke, and horribly he swore. ‘Not much that Turn is suited to my Mind, ‘As quoth the Clerk, it leaves a Sting behind. ‘But I had rather than a Tun of Ale ‘Our Dame, at Home, had heard this courteous Tale. ‘Forsooth, to say, was her Domestic Life ‘Expos'd, no tame Griselda is our Wife. ‘But 'tis the daily Burden of my Song, ‘If Things will not go Right, let 'em go Wrong. ‘To Common Sense I owe these Golden Rules. ‘None will suspect I learn them in the Schools. ‘Patience I court; But Patience oft is frail. ‘And, if He curs'd not, Job himself cou'd rail. ‘A heavier Plague He never bore in Life; ‘A very Heap of Vices is our Wife. ‘Tho' Poor and Low; yet far from Fond or True. ‘And of her Tongue, She is an errant Shrew. ‘Still joys her That, which contradicts my Will; ‘But if it must be so, be it so still. ‘Yet, here my Mind more fully to disclose, ‘Reveal'd to Friends, and spoke beneath the Rose; ‘Wou'd some kind Priest but forge the Papal Bull, ‘Annull, shou'd be my Instant Song, Annull.
