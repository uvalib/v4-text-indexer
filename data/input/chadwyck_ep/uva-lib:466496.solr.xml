      <field name="fulltext">THE BOTTLE. JOE Smith he was an engineer, A happy man was he: His wife and home to him were dear, And children he had three. His Mary made him promise her, 'Ere yet to Church they went, The bottle he would ne'er prefer, Though 'twas his former bent. And happy did they live awhile, And prosper in their lot; He loved to see his Mary smile, And own him not a sot. His children grew—his eldest girl, A modest mother's joy: His infant babe with flowing curl Played with his manly boy. The cat and kitten on the hearth, Before the blazing fire, Were happy in those days of mirth As any son or sire. Around the room was comfort spread; One picture on the wall— The Village Church where they did wed, Afforded joy to all. For often Mary pointed there, And blessed the happy time, When they became the wedded pair And heard the church bells chime. Her Mother's portrait hung beneath, With ears of golden corn: The cupboard door held Mary's wreath, She wore that happy morn. Her Father's profile near the glass, A daughter's love disclosed; And cottage ornaments, a mass, On chimney-piece reposed. Prince Albert and Victoria Were their domestic boast; “Regina regnat gloria,” Was Joe's and Mary's toast. And well they thriv'd—the time-piece true, Kept Joseph to his time: Respect and honor with them grew, As years advanced their prime. Oh! what could such a picture mar? What alter such a joy? What raise, 'midst peace, domestic jar, And love and life destroy? O hear it all ye sons of men, Hear what the moral saith, And let a poet's truthful pen Point to man's want of faith. Had Joe been faithful to his God, And lov'd his Word of truth, He would have felt correction's rod, Nor lost the life of youth. But Joe like many wanted grace, His stedfast way to keep: He sought not worship's holy place, Nor holiness to reap. If Joe work'd hard—he thought it hard His Sabbath-day to lose: He saw not—felt not life's reward, God's service 'was to choose. Hence he would spend that cheerful day, Not as it should be spent, In company with those who pray— To Church he seldom went. 'Twas hence arose his ancient foe, And took him by surprise: The devil tempted simple Joe, Because he was not wise. One Sabbath-day, in merry mood, Joe to his wife did say, “Come Mary, come, the wine is good, Let's have a glass to day. “Let's have a bottle, for 'tis long Since I have tasted wine; Surely there can be nothing wrong In Port both old and fine. “Come bring it out—let's have a glass; Come, Mary, fetch it here: Sue, bring the nuts my jolly lass! Let's be of merry cheer.” The wine was brought, the cork was drawn, The ale discarded stood, And Mary, like a timid fawn, First tried the ruby flood. 'Twas sweet, 'twas rich, 'twas rosy too, Joe stretched his willing hand; Here Mary, thus my love I woo, Another I command. He raised the bottle, held it high, Smiled on his charming wife: That Sabbath-day's first sad supply Destroyed his peace of life. For never Sabbath came again, But he must have his way, And that one bottle laid the train For death's most fearful prey. O all ye men come see the end Of Sabbath's so misspent, And take this lesson from a friend, On wisdom's ways intent. Let temperance and love abide, In joy and peace at home, So shall the tempter thrust aside, Fear 'neath your roofs to come. Come take a lesson, though it prove A sad, a heavy blow: Take it as proof of Christian love, Beneath this tale of Joe. Joe Smith, the once famed Engineer, His God and wife forgot: Soon took to gin and bottled beer, And soon became a sot. He kept no time, he took no pains, No master's voice would mind; Nor up, nor down, could work the trains, With drinking he was blind. All mourn'd to see Joe's fatal change; Threats of dismissal came: Joe heeded not—but took his range, And cared not for his name. Discharged from his employer's hand, Joe sauntered to his home; Assumed imperious command, And bade his Mary come. “Wife light my pipe! d'ye hear, I say, Woman, my voice my will, Is to have drink, my word obey, Send Sue to fetch a gill!” He sat him down, a stupid lout, Puffing his pipe at ease: His neckcloth twisted loose about, His coat all dirt and grease. His hands within his pockets thrust, He kick'd the fender o'er: He had no money, and no trust, His credit was no more. For who would lend to such a man Who'd drink from morn to night? Joe tried all means, tried every plan, But never tried the right. He sat him down, the night was cold, No coals were in the grate: For Mary had that day been told, Her coal-bills latest date. No supper too—no bread was there, No milk the cat could find: A knife and plate were lying bare, But Joe said—“Never mind.” “Give me the bottle, get me gin, “I care not from what sink! “Nor who goes out, nor who comes in, “If he but bring me drink.” He sat him down, nor moved his hat, It hung upon his head: Joe cared not if he starv'd the cat, Or children had no bread. His manly boy who nursed the child, Looked at his father's face: And little Emma would have smiled Could she a smile but trace. In vain they looked, dear children dear That father's face was dull: Young Joey could have shed a tear, His heart it was so full. He stared to see that bloated form, Once active, kind, and free: Whilst Emma nestled from the storm, On brother Joey's knee. That angel child with flowing hair, First fatal victim fell: She was of all the sufferers there, The happiest in her knell. “Take this,” quoth Mary, “that, and those, “And tell good Mister Quill “He shall of other things dispose! “Go, Sue, the bottle fill.” Poor Mary sigh'd, poor Susan cried, But cries nor sighs would do: Oh! that the bottle they'd denied And each refused to go! But, Susan went—she pawn'd the plate, The tea-spoons, trays and stand: And filled her apron with their weight But bottle kept in hand. Oh! could a man behold himself Once in a drunkard's state: He sure would shun the gin-tap's shelf, And drunkenness would hate. But blind he blusters on and on, Sees not himself in sin: He does as others long have done, But barter life for gin. Let him awhile look here and see, The progress made by Joe: And if he can from drinking flee, Pray God to keep him so. For here we see life's altered plan, Embittered past recall: Joe Smith, the miserable man, Involved in ruin's fall. Those ears of corn are drooping now, As honest friends depart: And drunkenness brings all things low, Save the proud drunkard's heart. Could he but see that loving wife, Whom he betrayed to woe: The partner of his early life, When he was happy Joe. Could he but see her yielding all, To satisfy his will:— When did the drunkard hear God's call And cease his glass to fill? Joe did not, for he never spent His Sabbath-days in prayer: But his own way he always went, That led him to despair. O all ye men, this lesson take, And live in godly fear: To joys of honest life awake, And love and peace revere. Joe Smith he was a woful man, Whence did his woes begin? With Sabbath drinking: tell who can, The consequence of sin. Joe still would have the bottle fill'd Oh! 'twas his darling joy: His heart with love it never thrill'd For daughter, child, nor boy. His wife an instrument he made, To do whate'er he taught; She saw too late the want of aid, Religion might have brought. Her courage failed: she lost her pow'r She felt Joe's loss of name: She rued unto her latest hour A wife's lost, injured claim. For she consented to become A pander to his taste, And soon she drank with him at home As all things went to waste. An execution soon put in, For long neglected rent: Still they'd enough to purchase gin, Till every thing was spent. An inventory soon was made, And Mr. Craft the man, Who valued in his own wise head, At half,—'twas ruin's plan. Ruin to those who wanted thrift, He thrived whoever fell; For cent. per cent. his cautious drift In this way he could tell. He stood with pencil in his hand, With wig cut close behind; His men were busy at command, And actively inclined. The clock it was an eight-day one, A marriage gift to Joe: But time and truth from him were gone, He cared not—they might go. The chest of drawers, Mary's pride, Once priz'd, were now removed: Though given to a happy bride, By parent once beloved. The Church, ah! Mary looked thereon With memory's sad regret; 'Twas taken down and stood upon, The rug not valued yet. The Bible on the table lay, A handsome well-bound book; Had that been opened every day, 'Twould far less gaudy look. But many love the outside show, Few love inside to search: As many glaringly will go, In dashing clothes to church. More to be seen of men than God, Externally they shine: To wisdom's life correcting rod, They care not to incline. Poor Susan with an anxious eye, Behind her mother's chair, Looked silently and wistfully Upon the busy pair. But Mr. Craft he heeded not The party near the fire, He noted down each moving lot, But cared not to enquire. And there sat Joe; his wife supplied The glass from out her hand: That bottle had it been denied Craft had not there to stand. Nor that sweet infant at the knee, On tiptoe shewn surprise; Nor that brave boy lament to see, His mother's red'ning eyes. That cottage near the mantle-piece, Had not been broken down, Nor trouble caused their bliss to cease, Nor gin their woes to drown. But Joe would drink—his pipe would smoke, His jug and bottle have; Was there no friend that might have spoke, Their precious souls to save? Joe would not hear them had there been, Nor let his children hear: He kept his lips upon the gin, And nothing reach'd his ear. Drink! drink! 'twas drink was all his life, The bottle sells his bed: He cared not for his soul nor wife, Nor children were they dead. As long as life supplied the gin, Tobacco warm'd his pipe, Preachers might preach and devils grin, Joe had no tear to wipe. Repentance came not, though remorse Crept slowly on his heels; The bottle brought its onward course,— God thus with drunkards deals. He gives them over to the spell, His Sabbaths to despise; They sink into the lowest hell Who cannot heaven prize. O all ye men the contrast view, And learn from Joe's sad end, A picture mournfully too true, And so your lives amend. For comfort on the Sabbath-day, The bottle cannot give: The word of God man's staff and stay, Points out how man should live. Joe Smith, Joe Smith was soon undone, A beggar's lot was his; Employment honest, he had none, And gin the cause of this. His Mary with that angel child, Trode with a woful face The streets, with beggary half wild, And found no resting place. Poor Susan now, no bonnet had, No shoes upon her feet; Her arms were naked, thinly clad, She begged along the street. And some who saw her thought her fair, And pitying gave their mite; With handkerchief to bind her hair She stood in woful plight. That manly boy in rags was seen Weeping to beg his bread: He met those children neat and clean With clothing comforted. Joe at the gin-shop's glassy door, Met Mary and poor Sue; He got his bottle filled once more, To that alone was true. Two shillings they had begg'd that morn, Joe took them quickly then, Resolved he would not be forlorn, And spent just one and ten. “Joey shall have the two-pence dear, “He begs so winning well: “Yon lady will afford us cheer “To have another spell. “I'll pocket this, come let's go home, “I'll give the babe a drop.” “Alas poor babe, his change must come, “Joe! will you never stop?” “Stop what you fool? what here? no, no, “Let's to our garret haste; “Come don't be preaching—let us go, “I have no time to waste. “Do'nt tell me that the babe can't stay, “But bring it 'neath your shawl: “On with you, on without delay “Gag it—I hate its squall.” Alas poor child 'twas very cold, 'Twas almost naked too: For Mary, shoes and frock had sold, To buy cream gin for Joe. Oh, better had it been for him, To have borne for David Bogue The porter's badge in honest trim, Than turn to such a rogue. Ah! Joe, thou little thinkest, I fear, The grave so near thy hell: Let yon churchyard thy son is near, Such solemn warning tell. Joe did not care, not he, not he, For gravestones nor for grave: The Chequers he could plainly see, And gin alone would have. Joe looked like that poor withered stem, Which in the churchyard grew: Life had for him no other gem, Than gin the drunkard's due. Mansions where wealth alone reclines, Beyond that churchyard stood: Joe's house was where domestic wines, And spirits were sold good. Bottle departments his delight, And strange the truth to tell: Many who move in fashion's height, Frequent that chequered hell. O shame! shame! shame! yet watch that door Children with bottles go: And ope and buy the liquid store, As well as beastly Joe. That very dog is less a beast Who licks the pavement scrap Than men who try not to resist, The bottle and the tap. For he but seeks his nature's food, His hunger to supply: Whilst drunkards drink their very blood, And know their souls must die. Could honest industry but see, The moral of this tale, How would she dread the thought to be Reduced to such a scale. The prudent wife though weaker, might God's strength induced to seek, Induce her husband to do right, And not the Sabbath break. Her children then the Mother's care, In virtue's paths might grow: And know of good a greater share, Than Mary did with Joe. But let her yield to vice of drink, She loses then her life: Polluted she must feebly sink, No more a happy wife. O all ye husbands love your God, Ye wives your lords obey: Ye would not then have feet unshod, Nor cause to beg your way. Ye would not spend your time in woe, Nor see your children poor: Ye would not like Joe's wife and Joe, Stand at the gin-shop door. But when the Sabbath gave you rest, And all your toil was past: Ye then would find how God had blest, The good man at the last. Weep nature weep,—O mother weep, But drown not woe with gin! Weep for thyself, for grief is deep, Which feels the depth of sin. What change came o'er the wicked Joe! At least upon his lot! He did not feel the sting of woe, Nothing could cure the sot. Cold misery and want deprive That angel babe of life; It could not tarry, could not live, With such a man and wife. For bread, the nourishment it craved, Gin had its place supplied; Its parents totally depraved, The staff of life denied. Awhile it lingered, languid, lean, Losely its tresses fell; Those auburn locks no more were seen To play in nature's spell. The garret where they all lay down, On mattress made of straw, Look'd like its inmates, crazy grown, In every part some flaw. The window dark and dismal was, And so was frowning Joe: It had not one whole pane of glass, To keep out rain or snow. Nor he one thought of better life To cheer his dark dull eye; Though whilst the gin was sparkling bright, Joe might the cold defy. “Come, mistress, come, dont blubber so! “I have no heart for grief; “Just take a glass to soothe your woe, “And give your soul relief. “Come, drink it down! don't hold the glass “So long without a sup, “I'm dull and stupid as an ass, “Come, mistress, drink it up! “I've got a pain that's gnawing me, “I want a glass of gin; “I feel as if my death 'twould be, “I am so cold within.” 'Twas cold without, that day was drear, Poor Joey wanted fire; Sticks on the hearth were lying near, Smoke could alone aspire. And there he sat, with naked feet, And watch'd that curling smoke; He had no word of love to greet— He wept, but never spoke. His elbow on his mother's knee, His hand upheld his head; Poor Joey could not bear to see, His sister Emma dead. Yet where the coffin half unclosed, Stood on the tressled board, Susan beheld the babe disposed, And wished it then restored. 'Twas such a lovely lively thing, 'Twas such a dear good child! It laugh'd to hear poor Susan sing, And kiss'd her when she smiled. But there it lay unconscious, calm, And placid in its death; Poor Susan wished some healing balm, Could give it once more breath. O happy Sue hadst thou been there, Beside that sister dear: Thou hadst not seen what grim despair Followed thine artless tear. Weep nature weep! poor Susan wept, To see dear Emma's face; So silently that angel slept, No sorrow could she trace. But sorrow round her Sue could see, Where comfort might have reigned, Had but her father sought to be, From gin alone restrained. That bottle which he held in hand, That bottle proved his foe; For even then with scowl he'd stand, Waiting to drink his woe. His hat upon the floor was placed, A box was all his seat; What misery could there be traced, And followed from the street. Of all the group one happy one Was there alone though hid, 'Twas Emma, Susan looked upon Beneath the coffin lid. Released from pain, from want and cold, She lay in ease alone; And as the truth these lines unfold, She died without a groan. But oh! what scenes those parents knew 'Ere yet their cup was full; Away her joyful spirit flew, No longer to be dull. O think ye men who yet survive, And see your children grow, Think, think, how dreadful 'tis to live The life of wicked Joe. Fear lest an angry God should cast, Your health and strength away, And give you to the wintry blast, A drunkard in your day. Whilst yet his favour may be sought, Return and seek the Lord; Love on his Sabbath to be taught, And flee not from his word. O dreadful pang! O wretched Joe, Could nothing mend thy life? Couldst thou behold thy babe laid low, And pity not thy wife? From day to day with struggling care, Trying to ease thy woes: The partner who thy love should share, Sharing alone thy blows. O drunkard, drunkard, see thy case, Too often pictured here: Start! and behold that horrid face, In folly's mad career. Hear that vile tongue blaspheme the name Of God and man alike; And horrid sight, O wretched shame, Joe dares to strike his wife. He dares to lift his hand intent On vilest fury's hate; And with his fist on mischief bent, Threatens poor Mary's fate. “One Sabbath-day, poor Mary said, “I'll go no more for gin: “Your children have not tasted bread! “Joe, 'tis a crying sin.” “I'll make you cry!—get up! be gone, “Take down the bottle now, “And get it filled or I'll have done “A deed on thee I vow.” “I'll go no more! I will not go! “Susan you shall have bread: One shilling only have I Joe! Would you, we all were dead?” “Yes dead indeed!—I'll be your death, “Do you deny my fill,? “I'll soon drive every bit of breath “Out of your frame, I will!” He rose in rage, knocked Joey down, Seized Mary by the neck: Whilst Sue alarmed to see his frown, Tried his mad-wrath to check. Down flew the table, jug, and all, O'erturned the only chair; And Mary's thin and tattered shawl, Blazed on the hearthstone there. “Hold Father! hold!” was Susan's cry, “I'll go and fetch the gin! “Do not in such a passion fly, “This is a greater sin. “O spare her Father! spare her pray, “Beat Mother so no more! “Don't! don't! you'll take her life away “And leave us to deplore.” 'Twas all in vain that Joey strove, By pulling hard his coat: Joe was to fury madly drove, As drinking parch'd his throat. His eye-balls started with the strife, For Sue nor Joey cared: He aimed and would have killed his wife Had no one interfered. The screams of Mary pierced afar, Through that most dreary house, And neighbours listening to the jar, Talk'd of their frequent rows. And oft the scream was heard to come, From son and daughter too: Ah! wretched miserable home! With mad and drunken Joe! Had not a neighbour come in haste That moment to the door, Joe would have held his Mary fast, And Mary been no more. 'Twas often thus, sad sight to see, Those dreadful broils begin: The bottle was their misery, That bottle filled with gin. O! that the brutal thirst of man, Should all his senses drown: See it! all ye who ever can, This frightful picture own. Is it a man's immortal soul, That prompts the fatal deed? Or demon who assumes control Death driving on with speed? Joe was a man who once was kind Attentive to his wife! And was to industry inclined, Hating domestic strife. 'Till Sabbath drinking he began, Took to the bottles way, And soon became an altered man, And perished in his day. Domestic bliss, for ever flown, Domestic brawls took place! And passions fiercely in him grown Gave him a demon's face. O man! how dreadful is the thought Of fury unrestrained; Oh! if by this sad lesson taught, Thy soul should be regained, The poet's pen, the artist's hand, Would joy to see thee turn, And charity's most high command With hope of life would burn. But if no lesson thou wilt take And onward still wilt go, And spend whatever thou dost rake, As did this drunken Joe; Then shall we sigh! but thou wilt pass From woe to woe within, And find the bottle and the glass End in thy death—by sin. Joe Smith the monster engineer, Who drank his life away, And never knew a godly fear, Soon knew a dread dismay. Mary was firm, she would no more, Such Sabbath drinkings spend; Oh! had she ventured this before, She had not met such end. Joe to his garret drunken came, Just as the Church-bell toll'd, And called it both a curse and shame, That gin should not be sold. “Let those that like their preachers, go, “Why should the gin-shop close?” Oh! miserable wretched Joe! Hence all thy piercing woes! “I would” quoth Mary: I could search “My Bible once again: “Gladly I'd seek my village church, “If peace I could attain: “But never, never shall I see, “That spot I loved so well; “Nor see my friends, nor they see me. “Nor hear that village bell. “O Susan! Joey! 'tis too late “God is too angry now! “O my poor husband! do not hate “The Christians holy vow!” Joe lifted up his angry eye, Blood-shot with drink and rage; “I do! all Sabbath days defy! “I hate the holy page! “Wife 'tis the bottle I like best! “And here I have it still, “Here's to you all—this is my rest “Whilst I can have my fill.” He drank his full, he cursed his wife, Kicked Joey from the fire, And riotously stirred up strife, And nothing cool'd his ire. Poor Mary tried to soothe his brain, Hot with the flame of gin; And Susan tried but all in vain, Sin added sin to sin. “Hurrah! hurrah!” the drunkard cried, “Out of my way ye fools: “The bottle shall not be denied, “For any village schools.” ‘What makes you look so mad on me, “Your senses you will lose,” Said Mary, bending on her knee, As Joe approached her close. He swore at Mary! roar'd aloud, Reel'd to the crazy door, As if resolved to brave the crowd, Which from the church might pour. “No! no! said Mary, stay Joe stay, “Don't go again for drink!” Joe turn'd as if her soul he'd slay, That life was on the brink. She seiz'd his hand, he turn'd him round, And smote her on the head: Senseless she fell with heavy sound, The bottle struck her dead. And Joe reeled round, with dizzy air, And knew not what he'd done: But sinking down upon his chair Heard not his Mary groan. Poor Susan ran into the street, Calling out, “murder!” loud: Policemen followed at her feet, Soon followed by the crowd. And there they saw poor Mary lay A corpse upon the floor, And drunken Joe in his dead way, Close by the cupboard door. They seiz'd and shook him from his dream! He rose and stood aghast; Started and gave one horrid scream And held the mantle fast. He saw the room with people fill'd, The bottle on the floor; He saw poor Mary he had killed, Prostrate before the door. He saw poor Susan weeping there, Pointing the dreadful tale: And Joey in his mute despair, Biting his finger-nail. The surgeon kneeling where she lay, Neighbours came pouring in: Alas! alas! that Sabbath day! See here the fruits of gin! 'Twas done 'twas done! the monstrous deed! The drunkard well might stare; O all ye drunkards take ye heed From this most dread affair. For never yet could passion thrive, Be it for what it might; O, take a lesson whilst alive Ye who can yet do right! Ye wives see here what fatal end Poor Mary found at last: God is the good wife's constant friend, Hold then his Sabbath fast. Joe mad, to prison ta'en away, There worse than death he knew; Reason no longer held her sway But from its centre flew. Would this were all—the closing scene Is yet to be revealed; God will the wicked never screen, Such shall in chains be held. Joe Smith, Joe Smith, the drunkard's doom, Here fatally is seen; A staring maniac in that room, At last at Bethnal Green. The clanking chains, the iron grate, The cold dull dark abode: O man behold the drunkard's fate, And fear the wrath of God! O let not passions thus indulged Lead thee to ruin's end: But truth and love to thee divulged, Hear thou an honest friend. Alas! poor Joe! but oh! alas! Those children left alone; See here, the bottles broken glass, Sends reason from her throne. And who the drunkard's son will have? Who will employ his child? Or who will from perdition save His progeny grown wild? Poor Joey known a beggar's boy, He wants a piece of bread: Taught not an honest man's employ, Thieves soon corrupt his head. They teach him tricks, to rob and steal, He quickly earns his board; They clothe him well, but who can tell, The horrors of his horde? And worse, still worse, poor Susan too Neglected, lost, undone; Wretches beguile her in her woe, She falls a ruined one. They dress her out in smart attire, Teach her the harlot's ways: And thus the bottle of the sire, The daughter's soul betrays. Dress! dress! deceitful love of dress, Fine things gay baubles all; How many souls whom God would bless, Thus flattered, tempted, fall. Some children of the devil are, From earliest day deceived: All education they will mar, No God have they believed. And some are high, some mighty men, And women of renown: Not like the peasant of the glen, Or simple country clown. Nor yet like these poor wretched things Left by their parents' sin; Some on the heights of folly's wings, Fall through the love of gin. O God where'er thy word's unknown, Unheeded and untaught, Though science may obtain a crown, Man will to sin be brought. For nothing else can cure the soul, Nor make the simple wise: Nor yet correct the loftiest fool, Nor ope the drunkard's eyes. Though nature be degraded here, A piteous sight to see; O! may God's mercy still be near, And move man's charity. Poor Susan could not quite forget, She still a father had; She asked her brother in the street, To visit him though mad. They went, they saw, O wretched sight He knew them not;—grown old Though 'twas broad day, with him 'twas night, He shivered 'neath the cold. And could he see that daughter fair, With feathered bonnet on, And polka-dress and parted hair, What would he think upon? And Joey too, that once brave boy, A swell-mob lad become: Could he behold the sight with joy, Or think of God and home! O parents weep! O children turn And pity their sad state; Let charity within you burn, Their souls compassionate. They live, they walk the London streets, They taste their father's sin: Their melancholy state completes The fatal love of gin. See here in hopeless vacant woe, Sits by the mad-house fire, With folded arms unhappy Joe, Joey's and Susan's sire. Does Susan think that she may be, One day such maniac too? O let her quickly turn and flee From such a dreadful foe! Oh! better far be poor in rags, And honest in thy life, Than live a nameless thing with hags In dress, and sin, and strife. O Joey, is thy father's state Indifferent to thee? If not; turn ere the day's too late, Come home to God—and me. I'll teach thee thou hast yet a soul, “Steal thou no more,” I'll say: Thy sin I'll bid thee yet control, And point salvation's way. I would not scorn, but pity take, I'd snatch you as a brand, Out of the burning fiery lake, And shew you God's command. Rejoice all ye who yet can press, Into God's righteous way; And keep in truth and soberness, Holy his Sabbath-day. The bottle thus abhorred shall be, No more to you a snare: But temperance and chastity, Will be your future care. To God! to God! all glory give! If any good be here! This is the way of life to live, And this is Godly fear. FINIS.</field>
