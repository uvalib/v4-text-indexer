      <field name="fulltext">POEMS BALLAD. The occurrence here related took place near the village of Gressenig, about a league from Stolberg, during the retreat of the French army, under Dumouriez. I Back to the river so lately pass'd o'er, Fast as that river flows, France takes flight to the Rhine once more From the might of her Austrian foes. II There was a young and lovely bride 'Mid the ranks of those that fled; She follow'd the steps and she fought by the side Of him she had lately wed. III She had left her home in that fertile soil Where the vine and the olive grow, For fields of blood, and to share in the toil That her lover must undergo. IV Alas! that love which had nerved her heart To war and its daring deeds, Could not to her tender frame impart The strength a soldier needs. V Now linger'd that youth with his bride in the rear, For her limbs began to fail, And the hue of her cheek, tho' unchanged by fear, With weariness grew pale. VI He look'd on her features in fond despair, As he held her to his breast; And her drooping head as they tarried there, Sunk in his arms to rest. VII From that hurried sleep when she woke again, Far from her anxious sight The distant bands of her countrymen Had vanish'd in their flight. VIII Then together they left the beaten track, And sought the forest shade: She wish'd from that host not a soldier back, While her own stood by to aid. IX Hid from the search of pursuers there, For days and nights they sped; The fruits of the forest their only fare, The leaves their only bed. X Fondly they thought that those paths might guide Once more to their native land; Vain hope! what sees that startled bride? Why grasps she her lover's hand? XI 'Tis the levell'd gun of a foeman near, Half hid by the copsewood screen;— She clung, as a shield, to that breast so dear, And the fatal flash was seen! XII They fell—their heart's blood stain'd the spot Where yon lonely cypress grows; Their bodies, pierced by that single shot, In a single grave repose. SONG OF ODIN. I. When Odin his buckler had girded on, Many a mother might weep for her son; Woe to the foeman who ventured nigh That unsheath'd sword or that angry eye; That club, when uplifted, ne'er fell to the ground But the brains of a victim were scatter'd around. II. When he led his bold band to the battle-plain, Who could e'er number the foes that were slain? Heap upon heap they were backwards cast, As drifted snow by the whirlwind's blast; In accents of thunder, he cheer'd to the slaughter, And his white lips foam'd like the ocean's water. III. Vainly the shrieks of the dying implore; His wrath was unquench'd, tho' he waded in gore; There was but one sound that could sink on his breast, Like a charm on the ocean, and lull it to rest; Still reek'd his red sword, still flash'd his fierce eye, Till the shout of his comrades was “Victory!” IV. Such was fierce Odin, and such must he be Who would banquet with him in the halls of the free; In the halls of the blest, where each warrior-guest Shall sit by the side of the maid he loves best; While sweetly her song shall his deeds declare, And her music shall charm with its witching strain, She shall smooth from his forehead the bloodclotted hair, That a chaplet of triumph his temples may bear As he drinks from the skull of a foeman slain. TRANSLATION. [The sea! unfathom'd in it depth, unbounded in its flow] I The sea! unfathom'd in it depth, unbounded in its flow; The sea! whereon the brave of heart may wander to and fro; The sea! within whose mighty arms the earth a captive lies, Whose depth is intermingled with the depth of distant skies. II The sea! how calm and smiling when with azure hue it gleams; The sea! how like a cradled child in playfulness it seems; The sea! which was my birth-place when the tempest shook its wave; The sea! within whose bosom I await a sailor's grave. III O sea! be mine no burial-place beyond thy rolling surge;— When the seamew, wildly screaming, shall have sung my funeral dirge, The billow, as a winding sheet enwrapp'd me, never more' Cast back my limbs to lie and rot upon the hated shore. IV It would pain and break my slumber were I laid below the sward; O'er the ashes of thy lover keeping fond and jealous ward, Yield not thy charge till summon'd by the trumpet loud and dread, Restore them not till doomsday shall awake and claim the dead. ON THE BOWMEETING AND FANCY FAIR Held at Hawarden Castle, August 25, 1835. The tents are pitch'd in Hawarden's peaceful vale, And harmless shafts the platted targe assail; While now the bow (by archers more intent On making love than making war) is bent, Beneath those towers, where erst their fathers drew, In deadly conflict, bows of tougher yew. The canvas stretch'd beneath th' o'erhanging wall, Now Beauty lures us to her glittering stall; While wares new fangled, shreds of motley hue, Profusely spread, the chequer'd counter strew. Beneath the magic of her touch, behold Transform'd at once the warlike arms of old! The mighty falchion to a pen-knife shrinks, Mail armour's meshes form the purse's links; The sturdy lance a bodkin now appears, A bunch of tooth-picks once a hundred spears! A painted toy behold the keen-edged axe! See men of iron turn'd to dolls of wax! The once broad shield, contracted now in span, Raised as a screen or flutter'd as a fan; The gleaming helm a hollow thimble proves, And weighty gauntlets dwindle into gloves; The plumes that wing'd the arrow through the sky, Waft to and fro the shuttlecock on high; Two trusty swords are into scissors cross'd, And dinted breastplates are in corsets lost; While dungeon chains, to gentler use consign'd, Now silken laces, tighten stays behind. Approach! nor weapons more destructive fear, Where'er ye turn, than pins and needles here. While hobbling Age along the pathway crawls, By aid of crutch, to scale the Castle walls, With eager step advance, ye generous youths! Draw the long purse, and strip the loaded booths! Bear each away some trophy from the steep! Take each a keepsake ere ye quit the keep! Come! every stranger, every guest draw nigh! No peril waits you save from Beauty's eye. THE PAPER KNIFE. Belinda! deem not this, my shining blade, A useless toy, alone for show display'd, But let this verse instruct thee how to prize A wand wherein such various magic lies. Peer'd at aslant, without my kindly aid, The light of learning were but half display'd; The Poet's song, pour'd forth in numbers sweet, Would waste its rhythm in the folded sheet; The march of intellect would lag behind, And science fail to benefit mankind. See 'neath my touch the sever'd leaves expand, Diffusing knowledge o'er th' enlighten'd land; I sweep the quarto with majestic stride, Through duodecimos with ease I glide; Hold in derision punctuation's laws, Nor stop at colons, nor at commas pause; While one bent figure questions, “Why so fast?” And one with admiration stands aghast! To suit the action to the word my care, Though oft “a passion into rags I tear!” When hosts conflicting desperate warfare wage, I cut and slash with all a hero's rage; When heroines pine in sentimental grief, With listless languor part the yielding leaf; With ruthless step the lovers' bower invade, And to rude eyes betray the blushing maid; The course of true love cannot smoothly run Through volumes three till my consent be won; By mine the point in epigram is shown, The edge of satire sharpen'd by my own; 'Tis mine to smooth the ruffled critic's spleen, When authors quarrel mine to intervene. Or true or false I let the secret out, Give wings to wit, and scatter jokes about! Hard drudgery mine, the everlasting scrub Of village news-room, and of London club; Think through what columns, each succeeding day, Both morn and eve, I pioneer the way; Sun, Star, Globe, Herald, Chronicle, and Post, My ivory baton marshals all the host; To vulgar eyes reveals affairs of state, Unfolds a tale or opens a debate. Ye quidnuncs, patience! though the Times be due, Ye needs must wait till I have skimm'd it through; What though its pen the universe control, It bides my pleasure ere its thunders roll. Advertisements uncirculated lie, Shows unannounced escape the public eye, Puffs, like the winds in Æolus' cave, are pent In hidden corners, till I give them vent. All sides alike my pliant labours fit, 'Twixt Whig and Tory I the difference split; On every argument lay equal stress, Promoting still the freedom of the press. Now with the swain through pastoral meads I stray, Now through dull epics plod my weary way, Now ghost-like glide before some tragic queen, Now, ever varying, shift the comic scene; Nor tear-drop falls, nor sides with laughter shake, Till I my entrance and my exit make. ON AN ARTIFICIAL ROSE. I As fairy like, thy bounding feet The joyful ground to music beat, Fair dancer! from thy garment fell This mimic rose I love so well. II I snatch'd it up—I kiss'd—I prest The fallen treasure to my breast; Nor all the sweets of Eden's bower Should tempt me to resign this flower. III Now let old Anacreon sing His darling rose, the pride of spring; To me more dear,—to me more sweet, Than nature's flower, this counterfeit. IV Say'st thou that its leaves are dry? At night I'll fill the goblet high; And as the bowl to thee I drain, I'll sprinkle them with ruby rain. V Tell me not the garden's rose With bloom inimitable glows; Rough winter comes with withering blast; Transient charm! behold it past. VI Time shall ne'er these leaves invade; They ne'er shall fall—they ne'er shall fade; But, like the love I bear to thee, This rose shall bloom eternally! ON PRESENTING A MIRROR to be placed in the Ladies' Cloak Room at Knutsford, Jan. 14, 1857. Fair dancers, since the privilege is mine, A gift to place in that forbidden shrine, Take, with the gift, the giver's caution too, Gaze on yourselves as we shall gaze on you! While on your neck the circling jewels lie, Dimm'd by the smile that sparkles in your eye, While the fresh bouquet in your fingers held Sees its own roses by your lips excell'd, Ere with rash step ye mingle in the dance, Fix on that mirror your observant glance; May future ages see, reflected there, Forms half so graceful, features half so fair! Let the prest glove cling closely to the hand, Snap the gold clasp, the ivory fan expand, Smooth the full skirt, adjust the pliant shoe, Each point, each fold, fastidiously review. So shall no rent the Brussels lace impair, Though jealous pangs the inward bosom tear; So shall the gown, through galop and quadrille, Though hearts be crush'd, remain unruffled still. Go! partners wait impatient for the ball, Go! smiling go! and bliss attend you all. THE DEATH OF GEOFFREY RUDEL the Troubadour, versified from La Gaule Poétique. “Geoffroi Rudel était devenu tout-à-coup amoureux de la princesse Mélinsende, alors en Palestine, sur ce qu'il avait entendu raconter à des pélerins de ses vertus et de ses grâces. Durant la nuit, durant le jour, en tout temps, en tout lieu, Geoffroi Rudel ne rêve plus qu'à cette femme, dont, au gré de son imagination, il se figure les traits angéliques et le parler plein de douceur. Ne pouvant vivre plus longtemps éloigné de cet objet parfait, il monte sur un vaisseau qui cinglait vers l'Orient. Pendant le trajet, assis à l'ombre des voiles frémissantes, il composait les romances les plus tendres en l'honneur de Mélinsende, qu'il compare à la divinité qu'on adore, bien qu'elle n'ait pas encore frappé les yeux. A cette mélodie, à ces vers mêlés de soupirs, les matelots ravis oubliaient en l'écoutant la rame et les signaux; et les dauphins, aux écailles argentées, suivaient le long sillon de lumière que le soleil ou l'astre des nuits tracait derrière le navire. “Mais dans le trouble qui l'agite sans relàche, une fièvre brûlante attise encore les feux d'un amour déréglé. Sans repos, sans nourriture, et ne cherchant, au milieu de sa vague contemplation, qu'à repaître son âme d'illusions et de chimères, il se consume, il va mourir. Déjà sa voix expire; mais le nom de Mélinsende est sans cesse errant sur ses lèvres décolorées. Cette image idéale qui le tient en extase, lui dérobe, comme par enchantement, et la vue de son danger, et même l'impression du mal qui le dévore. Le navire aborde, mais Rudel n'a plus qu'un instant à vivre. L'ami qui l'accompagne vole au palais de Mélinsende, et l'instruit de sa passion, du voyage et du péril de Geoffroi Rudel. Oh! second miracle de l'amour! A cet exemple de tendresse et de dévouement, cette princesse elle-même ressent pour celui qu'elle ne connait pas encore un sentiment impérieux qui l'entraîne au rivage; elle soulève dans ses bras l'harmonieux troubadour, dont les regards semblent verser sur elle la langueur et la volupté. Il la reconnait. Oui, la voilà! telle et plus belle encore que tant de fois il la vit dans ses rêves, qui n'étaient que des pressentiments; la voilà! . . . . et cependant ses yeux presqu'éteints vont se fermer pour toujours. O joie trop voisine d'un regret amer, c'est donc vous s'écrie-t-il? A ce mot il baise la main de la princesse, et rend le dernier soupir. On dit qu'à cet instant se rompit une corde de sa lyre, et qu'un lugubre murmure circula entre les sycomores de la rive orientale. Mèlinsende, inconsolable, quitte la cour de son père, abjure les grandeurs; et dans un monastère, près duquel elle élève à Rudel un superbe mausolée, elle veut consacrer le reste de sa vie à regretter er à pleurer son cher troubadour.”—La Gaule Poëtique, vol. vii. page 72. “Pétrarch, en parlant de cet infortuné troubadour, dit qu'il alla chercher la mort à force de rames et de voiles.” Her wandering pilgrims, from the Syrian shore, Provence has welcomed to their home once more; And gathering crowds, with eager voice, demand What tidings bring they from the Holy Land? They tell of battles by the Christian won, And deeds of daring by Crusaders done; They tell of perils and of toils past through, Till tears of pity every eye bedew; But worthier still of praise and wonder deem One gentle name, their still unceasing theme. In Tripoli dwells, endow'd with beauty rare, A virgin princess, Melinsende the fair; They tell how never on this earth as yet Such various gifts in one fair mortal met; How gentleness and dignity combine, How wit and wisdom in her converse shine; Romance ne'er pictured to the dreamer's sight A form so graceful or an eye so bright! As though enchain'd by some strange magic spell, Still lingering, listens to the tale they tell, With beating heart, the Troubadour Rudel. Fly! ere too late, unhappy Troubadour; Fly! ere those words to thy destruction lure. Alas! already that encrimson'd cheek And throbbing pulse love's influence bespeak! That name by day his song's untiring theme, That form by night the phantom of his dream. Amid the armèd chivalry of France, Rudel no more shall to the lists advance, Nor urge the steed, nor wield the knightly lance; Bright eyes, the glory of his native clime, Shall win no more the homage of his rhyme. Let other minstrels now their charms recite, He views them only as the stars of night; A fancied sun, in regions far away, O'erpowers their light and lures him to its ray. O'er fame and glory conquering love prevails, His parting speeds, and still with favouring gales Wafts on the vessel as it eastward sails; Yet oft the deck with restless step he paced, The winds outstripp'd by his impatient haste; Now silent, would he gaze with longing eye, Intent the haven of his hope to spy; Now when the winds were hush'd, and, in their stead, By stroke of oar the lab'ring galley sped, Beneath the shrouds reclining, would he string His plaintive lyre, and thus in sadness sing: Song. How bright with bliss, love-favouring night, When eyes, which I adore, with light Of seraph-sweetness beam; Sad day, how dark! when envious morn, From my fond sight that image torn, Dispels the dream! O blissful night, when whisper'd near Those accents charm my listening ear, And all my senses thrill! Linger, night, linger yet awhile, And bid that harmony beguile My slumber still! The morning sun disturbs a dream More beauteous than his midday beam— Strains which from Heaven fall! Strains which by day my ceaseless lyre, Still baffled in the vain desire, Would fain recall! To catch the echo of the words he sung, On their poised oars the listening sailors hung; The vessel's track, in glistening scales array'd, The dolphins follow'd as the minstrel play'd. Alas! already flush'd with fever's dye, The sunken cheek and the enfeebled sigh Tell how that flame, devouring night and day, With pain unceasing, wastes his heart away. Ah! fond delusion, she, unseen, unknown, That voice inspiring may not hear its tone, Save in the utterance of life's parting moan. In sight at length the wish'd-for shore appears, And now the port the straining vessel nears; Ere from the mast the fluttering sails they lower, The pitying sailors bear Rudel to shore. Swift speeds his page, the wondering Princess seeks, Kneels at her feet, and thus love's errand speaks: “Fair Melinsenda! from his distant home Fame of thy beauty lured Rudel to roam. From far my master, those bright charms to see, Has cross'd the waves that sever'd him from thee. Alas! that love which led him o'er the wave, In mockery guided only to his grave! E'en now, his pallet stretch'd upon the beach, Thy whifper'd name employs his feeble speech. Haste, gentle Princess! though the charms which gave Th' unconscious wound have now no power to save, In pity, haste! though Heaven his life deny, Bless with one look thy victim ere he die!” Urg'd by a secret sympathy, she flies, With eager steps, to where her votary lies; Though death now 'gan his closing sight to dim, He saw those eyes, and saw them fix'd on him. How far the bright reality excell'd Whate'er fond fancy had in dreams beheld! “'Tis thou! 'tis thou!” with struggling voice he cried, Press'd on her hand one fervent kiss and died. Faintly his falling lyre was heard to fling One plaintive echo from its broken string; The gale that swept it through the eastern grove Bore his chaste spirit to the realms above. LORELEI. Translated from the German. I Where the Rhine pursues its track By the walls of Bacharach, There a bright-eyed sorceress dwells, Hearts bewitching with her spells. II By her magic charms perplext, Bravest men are sorely vext, Knight nor peasant rescue find Whom her love-enchantments bind. III Her the Bishop bade appear, Judgment from the Church to hear; But could not her doom decree, Of so fair a form was she! IV Movingly to her he said, “Lorelei, misguided maid! What hath tempted thee to ply Damnèd craft of sorcery?” V “Holy Bishop! let me die, Weary of my life am I; In my glance there lurketh death, Whom I look on perisheth! VI “Stars of flaming light these eyne! Magic wand this arm of mine! Bind me to the burning stake, This my wand of magic break.” VII “Thy sad sentence must be stay'd Till thou hast confession made; Why, e'en now those flaming eyne Burn into this heart of mine. VIII “Lorelei! this powerless hand Dare not break thy magic wand, Or, with pity for thy sake, Truly my own heart would break.” IX “Why those bitter words to me, Sporting with my misery? Bishop! more I need thy prayer That God's mercy I may share; X “Let me die, since nought can move My sad heart again to love; Let thy lips my doom decree: Death no terror has for me! XI “Me my lover has betray'd, Left me a forsaken maid, Wandering on some foreign shore, To return again no more. XII “Eyes by nature soft and bright, Cheeks where blended hues unite, Voice of sweet and sorrowing tone, My enchantments—these alone! XIII “Nor can I their influence fly. Anguish stricken, I must die; When my features I survey, Sorrow wastes my heart away. XIV “Ere I die thy blessing give, That with Jesu I may live; Why must I on earth abide, Sever'd from my lover's side?” XV Three knights at his bidding wait: “Bear her to the cloister straight.” “Lorelei! God's mercy still Guard thy brain from further ill! XVI “Thou, in garb of nun bedight, Robe of black, and veil of white, There to prayer and penance given, Win thy way from earth to Heaven!” XVII Now the mounted knights, all three, Ride forth to the nunnery; Sadly on, with tearful eye, In the midst rode Lorelei. XVIII “Let me now, I pray thee, knight, Stand upon yon rocky height, Once again my sight would fall On my lover's castle wall; XIX “Once again my longing eyne Look into the depth of Rhine; Then, within the cloister gate, I on God will ever wait.” XX Where that rock from out the deep Like a wall rose straight and steep, Climbing up from stone to stone, On the top she stood alone. XXI Said the maid, “A bark I spy, On the Rhine-stream floating by; He whom I, returning, see Must, I trow, my lover be! XXII “Now my heart is light and free, My lost lover, it is he!” From the mountain's rocky bank Plunging—in the Rhine she sank! CHIMONANTHUS FRAGRANS. These blossoms of empurpled hue, They drink not of the vernal dew; They bloom not in the summer sheen, When flowers are gay, and leaves are green; When Autumn gilds the bright parterre, They mix not with the fragrance there; But when, the sky with clouds o'ercast, Rough winter chills the sweeping blast, Then, peering forth, each purple gem Shines bright upon the leafless stem. True friendship thus its presence hides; When all is bright aloof it bides; Shuns to intrude amid the throng When mirth and joy the hours prolong; But comes when flattering crowds depart, And sheds a balm into the heart; Then only, in affliction, known Its worth, when all the rest are flown! THE SCATTERED ROSE. A rose from the flowers in her garden she offer'd, But aggrieved was that rose to be sever'd from them, Ere press'd to my lips was the gift that she proffer'd The leaves at my touch fell away from the stem. Thus oft a fond wish by the chance of a minute Is crush'd—nor in joy when attain'd can we trust, Hope leads us on, but alas! when we win it And grasp it, the treasure oft crumbles to dust. Did the rose leaves thus scatter'd a warning betoken And shedding their fragrance my passion reprove? The green stalk, a symbol of friendship, unbroken, Stript of the leaves which embalm'd it with love. The thorn,—for still left on that stem may a thorn be, To the hand which bestow'd it no wound shall impart, Alone by mine own shall it patiently borne be, Nor touch with one sorrow the truth of her heart. I have but one fear—lest such love be resented, I have but one trial—its warmth to suppress, Evermore striving, with friendship contented, To merit that blessing by loving her less. SONG. Slumber on! while I watch o'er thee, Slumber in unbroken rest! Fittest guard to stand before thee Is the friend who loves thee best! Slumber on! and should'st thou, dreaming Of the starry realms above, See an angel spirit, beaming With a smile of heaven-born love; One with golden hair down flowing, One whom spotless robes invest, With a seraph's radiance glowing, Tranquil, pure, and bright, and blest;— Such the beauteous form which, waking, Gazing on thy peaceful brow, Such the form, sweet slumber taking, Which I see before me now. MODERN CHIVALRY. I Time was, with sword and battle-axe, All clad in armour bright, When cleaving skulls asunder Was the business of a knight. II Now chivalry means surgery, And spurs are won by him Who can mend a skull when broken, Or piece a fractured limb. III Our knights of old couch'd lances, Drew long swords from the sheath, Now knighthood couches eye-balls, And chivalry draws teeth. IV See! rescued from confinement, To charm our ravish'd sight, Fair ladies are deliver'd By the arm of a true knight. V Behold! the knight chirurgeon To deeds of blood advance, A bandage for a banner! And a lancet for a lance! VI To heroes of the hospital The “bloody hand” is due, But ye heralds bend the fingers, Or the fee may tumble through. AN ETON ELEGY. Ye distant spires, ye antique towers, What means that voice of moaning? “That voice,” the Tutors cry, “is ours, O'er food and fuel groaning. “With Greek and Latin we can store And cram the empty head, The stomach still with something more Substantial must be fed. “Once ‘Kings and Montem’ to obtain Our Eton bucks contended, Our Fatted Calves, sent home by train, Are highly now commended. “O, blissful days, when crown'd with bays, The Musæ Etonenses, Inspired by Keate, of butcher's meat Could laugh at the expenses. “For fuel though we spare at need A Virgil or a Horace, On books like worms we cannot feed, But else, what is there for us? “Thou, Gladstone, whose Homeric soul Was kindled by our Gradus, Full well know'st thou the price of coal, Why com'st thou not to aid us? “Trojan heads and helmets hacking Made blunt the swords of Greece; The egg-shells we are daily cracking Now twopence cost apiece. “'Twould time employ of every boy The cost to calculate Of all we buy at avoirdupois, Or purchase at Troy weight. “Etona! flourish long may she! But ruin will await her, If starved should we and brosier'd be, By our own Alma Mater.” December 29, 1873. THE PARROT. Translated from Florian. Uncag'd one day, A Parrot grey The neighbouring woods allure; From prison free, “I now,” quoth he, “Will act the Connoisseur.” He found in wail Of Nightingale Deficiency of skill; The plaintive song Drawn out too long, Too tremulous the thrill. The Linnet's throat Had scarce a note Worth listening to; although, If early taught By him, he thought, She might have sung so-so. No bird that sung The woods among True vocalist esteeming; Still something wrong In every song, He silenced them by screaming. One day they came, With ceaseless blame Provok'd to such excess; “Good sir,” they say, “Will you display The talent you possess? “Your taste so fine, No doubt, divine Your voice; we pray you, clear it; For doubtless we Much melody Might learn, if we could hear it.” Abash'd, his head Poll scratch'd, and said, “Incomparably good The judges deem My Parrot scream, But sing I never could.” THE BOAR AND THE SINGINGBIRD. From Florian. A millionaire of much pretence, Of great conceit, and little sense— For ignorance, as oft we see, Walks hand in hand with vanity— A savant in his own esteem, In every art a judge supreme, Of genius gold he thought the test, And wealth with taste and talent blest. Assembled round his table sit Men fam'd for science and for wit. No artist could his sketch complete Till he had laid it at his feet; No sculptor could a Venus cast Till compass he had o'er it pass'd; The architect his plans outspread; The author there his poem read. Their voices they in chorus raise His judgment and his taste to praise; And while he feasts them, one and all Their patron a Mæcenas call. One noon, as, 'neath the forest spray, He rambled in the month of May, A Woodman his attendant guide, Whose head with brains was well supplied; Behold! a boar, who now with toil Of snout upturn'd the forest soil, Now deep in earth was seen to wedge His tusk, to give it keener edge; Around him, fluttering as he plough'd, The wood-birds carroll'd sweet and loud; From forest-tree, from hawthorn-bush, Came linnet, nightingale, and thrush; Where'er he roam'd the tuneful throng Pursued him with unceasing song. The brute, a connoisseur profound In music, listen'd to the sound, Now raised his head, as if to tell The birds he liked their voices well, Now shook it in disapprobation While he resumed his occupation. “They choose,” said Dives, “much amiss, An animal so gross as this; Their music and themselves they wrong To make this brute a judge of song.” “Excuse me,” said the Woodman, “they But show the tact which men display; The soil upturn'd, his grovelling snout Brings many a dainty morsel out; 'Tis that which tunes their hungry throats, And prompts the music of their notes; The labour of his tusk they need Fresh worms to find on which they feed, The brute, with much self-satisfaction Deems his own merit the attraction.” THE SQUIRE OF DAMES; OR, A TOUR IN SPAIN. Polite Frenchman in the train, addressing the ladies with a low bow:— “Nous autres, nos femmes ne veulent jamais nous accompagner; mais voyager comme ca avec quatre dames, cela doit être pour monsieur un bonheur suprême.” How happy who travels from London to Cadiz, Sole protector and guide of four sight-seeking ladies! No bachelor, selfishly taking his fling, But with four pretty birds underneath his own wing. He from morning till night pleasant duty must do; He must count all their boxes, and pay for them too; He must number his troop too, as well as their bags; He must check the front rank when the hindermost lags; He the wild ones must watch lest they wander astray, And implore them when walking to walk the same way. He must wake them ere dawn from the depth of repose, And have breakfast prepared ere the omnibus goes, he must order a “plat” that each palate will please, Or biftek, or cutlet, potatoes or pease; He must seek the lost glove, the strapp'd mantle unroll; He must run to recover the lost parasol. Where'er fancy leads, he must shop them about, And produce the small change they are always without; His gauntlet must down on each counter be thrown, He must wage wordy war in a language unknown; Each purchase a matter of life or of death, He must talk till exhausted from sheer want of breath, Whether gloves for the fingers, or boots for the feet, He must fight and fight on till the bargain's complete. A retreat from the heat of the eventide sun, The cathedral comes next when the battle is done; Single file down the aisle, where throng'd worshippers kneel, Till we face the High Altar, then right about wheel, While each worshipper turns from the Virgin her eye, To stare as the strangers in bonnets pass by. He each shrine must unlock with a silver-wrought key— From the touch of fair finger no relic is free— Know each martyr whose name the side chapels assume, And what bones are enclosed in each canopied tomb; He must scan the whole plan with an architect's eye From the marble-paved floor to the vaulting on high; He must make to their female capacity clear The date of each window, the style of each pier, What was built by the Moor, what rebuilt by the Goth, What has since been despoil'd by the Gaul in his wrath. Then away to the gallery, guide-book in hand, He must tell what to look at, and show where to stand; In the annals of Spain be unerringly versed, And know Philip the Second from Philip the First; Point out with what vigour Velasquez could paint, How sweetly Murillo could picture a saint. 'Bove all, he their zeal in due bounds must restrain; Behold them dropp'd down from the Seville night train. Which, think you, they stand most in need of, that group At the Malaga station-house, slumber or soup? Some had slept a small sleep, some had slept not at all, Kept awake by that plague which “the fidgets” they call; One dry roll apiece for their breakfast and lunch, With an orange to suck at, a sausage to munch; Their hair all dishevell'd, their hats all awry, Four ghosts in appearance: but never say die; All keen for the Dilly next morning at four, En route to Grenada for twenty hours more. He must teach them to spell “Inglaterra” aright, He their letters must stamp when they've finished them quite, With the dates of their progress must ne'er be perplext, That dear sisters may know where to write to them next; Hunt out the poste-restante, and patiently bear Their abuse, his own fault if no letters are there. With these and a thousand such pleasures repaid is That man highly favour'd, the Squire of four ladies. THE SPANISH BARBER. What sights abound the world around, let tourists live and learn; And Brown and Jones and Robinson go visit each in turn: The battle-field at Waterloo, the bull-fight at Madrid, While some delight their names to write on Cheops' pyramid. Some tour to Tours, some roam to Rome, some trip to Tripoli; Still something strange, where'er they range, for travellers to see. To me no sight gave such delight as I at Seville felt When I stood before the very door where Figaro had dwelt. A fencing foil the Frenchman with dexterity can twist; Pre-eminent is England in the science of the fist; But with Spain no other nation in the universe can cope In expert manipulation of the shaving-brush and soap. My beard, when I reach'd Alicant, was like a currycomb, Or, “like a stubble-land new reap'd, it show'd at harvest-home;” With anxious step I wander'd till, suspended high in air, A brazen basin told me that the spot I sought was there. I thrust aside the curtain-veil that screens it from the street; The Barber bows, and beckons to a softly-cushion'd seat; Enfolds me in a napkin, white as snow on mountain top, And to and fro the blade revers'd glides glibly o'er the strop. A bungling British shaver would have seized me by the nose, Would have brush'd my lip with lather where no hair upon it grows, With shrug and screw and sacre-bleu at beard so overgrown, A Frenchman would have held my jaw, and not have held his own. My parch'd and thirsty beard an irrigation over flows, A saponaceous liquid sweetly perfum'd by the rose; His blade, as still he pass'd it and repass'd it o'er my chin, I felt as if a lightning-flash were playing on the skin! So skill'd within due limits still its keenness to confine, He touch'd not there a single hair beyond the shaving-line. How I wish'd it, when completed, how I wish'd it just begun, A work of art so delicately, exquisitely done! I felt as if my chin were iced when, penetrating through, The balmy air of morning on the shaven surface blew; He powder'd it, unnapkin'd it, and then he look'd me o'er; And, conscious of a triumph, said, Servito, Señor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPIGRAMS. ON SEEING ON THE SAME BOOK-SHELF Johnson's Lives of the Poets, and Johnson's Lives of Highwaymen. See British bards and British cut-throats made Alike immortal by a Johnson's aid! The neck with hemp, the brow with laurel bound, The pen, the pistol, equally renown'd! Fame's temple reaching by a different track, Dryden on wings or Turpin on a hack! CARVING AND GILDING. “You see,” said our host, as we enter'd his doors, “I have furnish'd my house à la Louis Quatorze.” “Then I wish,” said a guest, “when you ask us to eat, You would furnish your board à la Louis Dixhuit; The eye, can it feast when the stomach is starving? Pray less of your gilding, and more of your carving.” A RETORT UNCOURTEOUS. Where London's city skirts the Thames, In ball-room met two rival dames; Quoth one, “Why all this youthful sham? You now are but a has-been, ma'am.” “'Tis better far,” was the reply, “To be a has-been such as I, Than still to hang upon the shelf, A never-was-er like yourself.” A NEW DENOMINATION. Phœbe has lived a life of schism, Been every “ite,” tried every “ism;” Where rings the peal of pulpit thunder Which she in turn has not sat under? Each change of wind gives fresh occasion For shifting to a new persuasion; While wondering gossips, o'er their tea, Each other ask, “What will she be, When next the Times shall as a convert quote her?— A Plymouth Brother or a Yarmouth Bloater?” ON A NEW CHURCH, ERECTED A.D. 1842. A shallow chanel, scarce six feet by ten, Which rail'd and painted forms a decent pen; A lofty spire, which bears its glittering vane Some hundred feet exalted from the plain; Say, was this would-be Christian elevation Built for devotion or for ostentation? By the tall spire we gauge the pride of man, The world's devotion by the chancel span. ON THE ADMISSION OF JEWS INTO PARLIAMENT. For years unblest, all hope of rest forbidden to his feet, At last the Wandering Jew has found in Westminster a seat; Jews' ears, they say, in olden days were fill'd with molten lead, The gold from out their pockets pick'd, the eyes from out their head; Now, torturing still, with fresh ill-will, we show our ceaseless hate, And pour into the Hebrew's ear the lead of a debate. ON SEEING SOME NAMES CUT ON A PANE OF GLASS. I True wit, with sablest ink, On crystal writes in vain; The trickling letters sink, And fade upon the pane. II But, ah! should Folly's finger With a diamond ring be blest, His name and nonsense linger, Indelibly impress'd. III On Chloë's heart the same, To sense and merit cold, Whoe'er would grave his name Must boast a pen of gold. EVERY MAN HIS HOBBY. A wealthy Cit, intent to buy Each picture rare that pleas'd his eye, Who would not, if a Claude were sold, Forego it for a mine of gold; On hearing at how dear a rate His friend had purchas'd an estate, Rebuk'd him thus: “What madness, say, Induc'd you such a sum to pay? Of land I know the market price, How could you without my advice?” “Why,” quoth the other, “thus abuse me? Call it my picture, and excuse me.” APPROPRIATE NAMES. James three horses breeding, Long time one was driven, One o'erfond of feeding, One to rearing given. Would you know their names? If you care to hear 'em— They were call'd by James Tempus, Edax, Rerum. A TURN IN THE HIGHLANDS. “To Highlands I'm off for a fortnight,” says Jack, “With just one shirt a week.” “But that one's on your back, When the first week is over what then will you do?” “Why turn it, and then I can wear it for two.” NOTES AND QUERIES. A lady sat by me at Verey's, Making at me very queer eyes: A twenty and a five pound note Were in the pocket of my coat: I made no note of her departur, Though many a query I made arter; For when that lady went from Verey's With her went both notes and queer eyes. STRIKING BEAUTY. Tom, struck by her face, took and married a wife, Hoping in conjugal bliss to dwell; Tom little thought that, in after life, He should ever be struck by her fist as well! A BOTTLE OF THE OLD. “This tawny old port has quite lost all its smack; Pray, what bin is it from?” “From the has been,” said Jack. A SCENE IN THE HIGHLANDS. One day in the Highlands while taking a stroll I saw a stray sheep down a precipice roll; A boy was let down by a rope o'er the brink, And the sheep was pull'd up by the horns: you may think What a beautiful picture it was, the whole scene. “A picture!—a bas-relief surely you mean!” JONES ENLIGHTENED. At Bordeaux, when autumn had ripen'd the vine, And the natives were treading the grapes into wine, Said Jones to a friend whom he chanced there to meet, “Now the reason I know why they call it La Fitte.” SO MUCH FOR SENTIMENT. It is gone, the old oak, which, for centuries past, With branches wide-spreading had weather'd the blast, A tree of primeval type! Accurs'd be the axe which was laid to its root! “Sir, it fetch'd,” said the factor, “five shillings a foot, And the tree was maturely ripe.” SINK OR SWIM. The ship was wreck'd, and struggling with the Ocean's angry tide, To a broken spar were clinging wife and husband, side by side; Said he, “This awful moment, love, our last may chance to be, Have you always, dearest, always been a faithful wife to me?” “Ah! what,” quoth she, “our fate may be, we neither of us know, But that secret, sink or swim, love, to the grave with me must go.” [Of old, when the church-building coffer was full] On hearing that two pigs from the Home Park, Windsor had been presented, by command of Her Majesty, for the benefit of the Building Fund of the Victoria Congregational Chapel.—1864. Of old, when the church-building coffer was full, Ere the work was begun, they requir'd a Pope's Bull; Nowaday, when supremacy rests with the Whig, Congregational chapels require a Queen's pig! A LAWYER'S BILL. What a strange bill of costs do some lawyers indite! I this item in mine discover— “To lying awake in my bed at night, And thinking your business over.” PROCRASTINATION. Bent on building a house, while as yet a young man, Visto reach'd his old age ere he settled the plan; When perfection the plan, still his taste so refined, He could never make choice of a site to his mind; Death grew impatient, and call'd to his aid The Sexton, who housed him at once with his spade. A PROMISE TO PAY. Said Dick, “The ten pound which you lent t'other day, I hope soon, in some shape or other, to pay.” “‘In some shape or other!’ but pray, my good man, As much in the shape of ten pound as you can.” CAUTION AND ECONOMY. The plan reduced from small to less to make his house compacter, The Builder, his own Architect, became his own Contractor. TRUTH. Truth, they say, lies in a well: The truth of that I cannot tell; Where nothing is except cold water, There I never yet have sought her; And the only truth that I know Is the “Veritas in vino.” A VOYAGE. From morn till night one only change have we, We see a ship, and then we ship a sea. A MINOR CANON. “New phrases daily on our ears are prest,” A pert young Canon thus the Dean addrest; “Word-studying, Sir, I know is your profession— ‘Son of a gun!’—what means that strange expression?” “Son of a gun! why surely that must mean A minor Canon,” said the quiet Dean. A REASON. “The case is clear as case can be, As plain,” quoth Joe, “as A, B, C.' His friend replies, “It may be so, But I am D, E, F, you know.” AN EXPEDIENT. “As my neat little feet will not fill them enough, Cotton wool in my boots as a padding I stuff:” “Sir, no substitute better than cotton I know, Since you are, as you tell us, deficient in toe.” EQUAL JUSTICE. By the Mantuan law, the old chronicle saith, The vendor of poison was sentenced to death; Did the law now at Venice like justice bestow, Our Host had been hung when he sold his Bordeaux. THE LITTLE I DRINK. “My Lord, pray excuse the remonstrance I make To the bumpers which still after dinner you take; You appear what you told me just now to forget, That the little you did drink you drank when you eat.” “As you say, 'twas the little I spoke of before, The great deal I drink is when dinner is o'er.” PADDY'S REMONSTRANCE. “Pat! buy a trunk?” “Sure, for what”? he replied, “Why to carry your cloaths,” said the dealer, “inside.” “Bedad! now a mighty queer notion is that, Would you have me go naked entirely?” said Pat. COMPLAISANCE. Mrs. B—, when she sat for her picture, Intent upon looking her best, Her mouth to the smallest of circles By screwing and twisting comprest. Said the painter, “Why take so much trouble To make its circumference small? If you wish it, your face shall be painted Without any mouth, ma'am, at all.” TWO OF A TRADE. 1865. Pedestrians! buy your pantaloons at sixteen shillings new; But ere you measure miles in them, the Miles must measure you. Since two of one trade never yet were able to agree, Of course there must a breach between two breeches-makers be. These two contending tailors, call them Mileses, if you please— But Miles in the plural should be written Milites— The curious fact which causes most their customers to wonder, Though scarce ten yards apart, the two are Miles and Miles asunder. MR. BRIGHT ON THE LAW OF ENTAIL.—1864. To broad lands though a foe, to broad brims still a friend, We shall all become Bright's proselytes in the end; Elder sons apprehending the loss of their acres, John's speech has already made all of them Quakers. HIDDEN TALENT. “The lady you took into dinner Has abundance of talent.” “No doubt She must have a great store of it in her, Who never lets any come out.” SPIRIT-TAPPING. “The appearance of spirits, it fills me with dread; Do you believe in it?” My landlady said; “If you mean disappearance, I credit it quite, For my brandy has all disappeared in the night.” HIS LORDSHIP'S INVITATION. “Your Client had better a compromise make,” Said the Judge; “will you ask her, Sir, what she will take?” Very deaf the old dame, so the Counsel drew near, Bawling, “What will you take, asks my lord,” in her ear; “Take?” replied she, “how exceedingly kind! Say, a glass of warm ale, if his Lordship's inclin'd.” LENGTH AND DEPTH. “Were you struck with the length of my sermon to-day?” “Yes, but not with its depth, Sir, allow me to say.” LITTLE LOVE. Little Love into my bosom darted, He kindled a flame there and then departed: From his fluttering wings as he fled, the air Blew out the flame he had kindled there: Little Love flew to my bosom once more, And kindled a flame as he'd done before; The fire that he lighted now blaz'd so high The flame caught his wings as he spread them to fly; And in spite of himself Little Love must stay, For his pinions are burnt and won't bear him away. ON THE FIGURE OF A NEGRO SUPPORTING A DIAL. (IN FRONT OF ENTRANCE, ARLEY HALL). To those critics one word, who the reason implore, Why I place a black statue in front of my door? I think it a well chosen spot, I confess; A negro of course should be near an egress. ON VISITING THE GREAT DUBLIN BREWERY. Brewing the best way hard money to win is: Guinness makes porter, and porter makes guineas. CROSS-QUESTIONING. His wardrobe from Moses and Son, spic and span, The witness stood up, quite an exquisite man: “A broker, I think, Sir, and worth a Jew's eye?” “I ham, Sir, I ham,” the emphatic reply. “And indeed,” said the Counsel, “it must be confest I ne'er in my life saw a ham better drest.” THE CENSUS AND THE FAIR DISSENTER. “Rude querist! my feelings your question enrages— To ask a young woman like me what her age is! Twenty-five, Sir, it may be, about that or less.” “And what the religion, ma'am, which you profess?” “Sir! I shall not on any persuasion decide Till I know what is his who will make me a bride.” [Stone ox! if we were hungry you would satisfy but little us] An ox carved in stone, and placed over the door of the public slaughter-house at Nuremberg, bears the following inscription:— Omnia habent ortus suaque incrementa, sed ecce, Quem cernis nunquam bos fuit hic vitulus. Stone ox! if we were hungry you would satisfy but little us: You never were a calf; though carv'd, you were not carv'd to victual us. RAILWAY DIALOGUE. In the train a Lord Chancellor, taking his seat, Thus address'd an old friend whom he happen'd to meet: “You, Serjeant, are double the man you once were, You are grown quite a porpoise of late, I declare.” “Much pleasure, my lord, as a porpoise, I feel To find myself seated so near the Great Seal.” A MYSTERY. Thus a young wife, alighting from the train, Rebuk'd her husband in the gentlest strain, “When we in darkness through a tunnel glide, You should not kiss me, dearest, though your bride.” “Kiss you! Not I! I kissed you not.” The pair In mute amazement at each other stare. A DIALOGUE OVERHEARD IN A VILLAGE NEAR PORTSMOUTH, DURING THE WAR WITH FRANCE. Says Sue to Jack, “The reason why we English wins the day, 'Tis because before a battle them 'ere Frenchmen never pray:” Jack he answer'd scornful, as he spat and turn'd his quid, “Jabbering beggars, no! who'd understand 'em if they did?” ARGUMENT OF A DISSENTER IN FAVOUR OF THE BURIAL BILL. I never to the church will give My soul's submission while I live; But why should she exclude when dead My body from a churchyard-bed? Because when she has seen it laid In safety by her sexton's spade She surely cannot feel distress That there is one Dissenter less. THE CHURCHMAN'S THREE WISHES. A churchman, three things in this Christian land I long ere I die to see: A mitred bishop whose heart could withstand And scorn popularity. A minster with altar and choir deck'd out As in older times they were; The vast nave throng'd with a crowd devout Of worshippers kneeling there. The third and last thing which I earnestly pray To see, and then die content, Is a Royal Wedding, for once in a way Not solemnized in Lent. POINT LACE. Kate, when you lace-work undertake Work silently, I pray, Since point there is in what you make, But none in what you say. FRENCH CLOCKS, 1876. Electric clocks in Paris now on trial, So prompt are Frenchmen to adopt improvement; We trust the hands may not be on the dial Symbols of revolutionary movement. Working by pendulum, like old French clock Ne'er yet have Frenchmen gone two days alike; Blest would they be, could one electric shock Compel them all in unison to strike. FROM THE ITALIAN. While his beard has grown gray, black as ever remain The hairs of his head, and the reason is plain: The jaws have been hard at work all his life through, The brain has had little or nothing to do. TO A STATUE OF CUPID BEARING A BOW AND QUIVER. Armed Boy! thine arrow try, Pierce her heart for whom I die. Ah! no answer. Boy unkind, Art thou deaf as well as blind? ON AN ILL-NATURED PARASITE. When he eats, 'tis to banquet as somebody's guest, When he speaks, 'tis to utter some venomous jest; So he never to open his mouth condescends Unless it be done at the cost of his friends. MY NEIGHBOUR. “My neighbour—an eternal ninny— Is ever knocking at my door.” “Lend him, when next he calls, a guinea, He'll come, I warrant him, no more.” [Through life the poor dolt who lies buried below] Through life the poor dolt who lies buried below In the alphabet found an invincible foe: Though not by the weight of his gravestone opprest, The inscription upon it will trouble his rest. [A martyr to verse, writing rhymes without number] A martyr to verse, writing rhymes without number, He himself lies awake that his readers may slumber. [The Duke lieth here; and in sorrow I bend] The Duke lieth here; and in sorrow I bend O'er the tomb of my best and most bountiful friend; Believe me, the tear which I shed is sincere, My pension, as well as the Duke, lieth here. [To paint some charms, as poets feign] To paint some charms, as poets feign, Twice ten thousand words are vain. To make Aminta's features known We need but three—rouge, skin, and bone. ON AN ILL-NATURED BEAUTY. The rose's bloom her cheek adorns, And in her tongue we find the thorns. [Not prettier hands the Queen of Beauty grace] Not prettier hands the Queen of Beauty grace, But Nature gave them thee to hide thy face. [Licander in life has one object alone—] Licander in life has one object alone— He hopes to find out the Philosopher's stone; Day and night in his study Orlando we see, Intent upon squaring the circle is he; While clearly to comprehend Chloe's caprice, Is the task which incessantly troubles my peace. Chloe! say to which first will the palm be decreed? Which, think you, will first be the one to succeed? [“Why were prudence and valour to women denied?”] “Why were prudence and valour to women denied?” Said Momus to Jove: Jove to Momus replied, “In Beauty, with which I endow'd womankind, Compensation sor both they abundantly find.” “Is Beauty sufficient?” “Go down, silly elf, If you doubt it,” said Jove, “and ask woman herself.” [“Love! beauteous boy!” Aminta cries] “Love! beauteous boy!” Aminta cries, “How chanc'd it that you lost your eyes?” “I gave them both away,” said he, “To my daughter—Jealousy.” FROM THE FRENCH. Said Bassompierre, “When I in Spain abode, Sire, on a mule in cavalcade I rode:” The King to his Ambassador replied, “An ass then sat upon a mule astride;” “Sire!” he retorted, “what you say is true, When at Madrid I represented you.” NO QUARTER. “Oh! spare my life!” a German cried, While the French foeman at his side His blade uprais'd to thrust it through him; “Whatever else you wish,” said he, “I shall be charm'd, mais pour la vie Il n'y a pas moyen”—so he slew him. THE GASCON. A Gascon one day when a Cardinal's guest, Great boast of his river the Garonne exprest; So deep, so expansive, so rapid in flow, The world to that river no rival could show. Said his host, “Then, compared to that wonderful stream, You the Tiber at Rome but a rivulet deem?” “The Tiber forsooth!” he indignantly said; “Let it hide underground its diminutive head; Should it dare, Sir, to flow by my old castle wall, In the course of one hour I would bottle it all.” VERSAILLES. One day at Versailles the Great Louis survey'd And describ'd with much pomp the vast change it display'd; “Where yon Temple now stands, overlooking the wood, On that spot,” said the Monarch, “a windmill once stood.” “Please your Majesty, true,” was the answer; “the mill Is remov'd, as we see, but the wind is there still.” THE GAMESTER. Said a Lady to a Gambler, “Such ill-luck attends your dice, Why not at once forswear them, and forsake a thriftless vice?” “When you your loves abandon, I will cease to play,” said he. “Incorrigible Gamester! you a ruin'd man will be.” THE WATERLESS BRIDGE. Of water though the channel bare is, A royal bridge at Manzanarès Uprears its arch on high; That costly bridge, if it were sold, Then might King Philip with the gold A little water buy. THE REBUKE. Said Brown—“When I, myself to rid Of pestering Arabs, fiercely chid The swarm which throng'd the Pyramid, —My false teeth as I loudly swore By chance fell out,—then all was o'er, And not a word could I say more!” “You muff!” said Jones.—“Had you been quick And seized that moment for the trick, You might have talk'd Gum-Arabic!” CURE FOR TOOTHACHE. ‘Why you should suffer so much pain I cannot tell,” said little Jane, A visitor embracing: “Out from your mouth why don't you take Your teeth at once, and let them ache, As Ma does,—in a basin?” ON THE PICTURE OF THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE, CUT AND STOLEN MAY, 1876. By none could her charms be surpass'd in their day, So peerless was Devonshire's Duchess, they say; One kiss on her cheek—ere the contest begun, She paid down the price, and her canvass was won! How changed now her fate! To the purchaser's cost Her charms are cut out, and her canvass is lost! THE BARBER ABROAD. I Said Crimp the hair-dresser, when he New life abroad resolv'd to see, “Behind me I will leave my three Apprentices to dye. Keep sharp and bright the scissors here Lest customers turn rusty, dear!” Then, sponging from her cheek a tear, He bade his wife “Good-bye.” II Thus Crimp, who, tir'd of cutting hair, Had sworn to cut the whole affair, Set off to spend a month elsewhere, Away from house and home, O. He travell'd in the coupée straight To Switzerland;—with wonder great He saw the Jungfrau's powder'd pate, And then brush'd on to Como! III Ah, sorely then was Crimp perplex'd Where he his chin should lather next; As when by blunted razor vex'd, The doubt disturb'd his peace. The barber might, if march he stole On Russia, reinstate the Pole; But how could hair-dresser control His hankering for Greece! THE LEY OF THE LANDLORD. I love my good ley on a clear winter's day, I love it when clad in the verdure of May, I love it when summer has stock'd it full With short-horn and long-horn, stirk, heifer, and bull. I love my good ley through each month of the year, But I love my ley best when October draws near, When yellow leaves falling the pasture bestrew, And betoken the gold that ere long will be due; I love my ley best when the profits begin, When the cattle walk out and the cash comes in! THE MAID OF THE INN. Kate! could I claim thee as “ma maîtresse,” My joy would be, thou pretty waitress, Myself on thee to wait, O, To fill thy cup, to hand thy dish, To serve in turn or fowl or fish, Or pickle or potato. No! keep thy tray, my pretty maid. By me thou shalt not be betray'd, Nor with thee can I mate, O. Still, still, the love I bear thee, Kate, That love, sweet changer of my plate, Shall be the love of Plato. PAST AND PRESENT. On four-horse coach, whose luggage pierced the sky, Perch'd on back seat, like clerk on office-stool, While wintry winds my dangling heels kept cool, In Whitney white envelop'd and blue tie, Unpillow'd slumber from my half-closed eye Scared by the shrill tin horn; when welcome Yule Brought holiday season, it was thus from school I homeward came some forty years gone by. Thus two long days and one long night I rode, Stage after stage, till the last change of team Stopp'd, splash'd and panting, at my sire's abode. How nowaday from school comes home my son? Through duct and tunnel by a puff of steam, Shot like a pellet from his own pop-gun. RIDDLE. “A woman, though my head and tail are both of them the same; And still, both head and tail cut off, I bear a woman's name. You may turn me topsy-turvy, but the change will naught avail— A woman, whether taken by the head or by the tail; But when you cut my head off, should my tail escape the shears, Metamorphosed to a man then, the woman disappears!” CHARADE. I have loved, through years of happiness, My first and second well; The maiden that I wedded, And the home wherein I dwell. Although on both encroaching, My third bring many a change, From my first nor from my second Shall it e'er my heart estrange. For still that cherish'd feeling Shall I till death retain; Till full and free possession Of my whole another gain. CHARADE. My first and my second, united, display A word still encircled with laurel and bay; Made complete with a k, if you have but my third, You without more ado will discover the word: For my whole let the funeral bell be toll'd, He died in the night when the weather was cold; He died in the night the same year he was born in, And his successor came into office next morning. A DILEMMA. A lady fair had lovers three, All fellow-passengers at sea. It chanc'd when loud the tempest roar'd That Lady fair fell overboard; Two straightway plung'd into the wave And snatch'd her from a watery grave; Then wept that Lady fair, and cried, “How can I thus perplex'd decide? Good Captain, aid my choice to make, Which think you now ought I to take?” “Since my opinion you rely on,” The Captain answer'd, “take the dry un.” SONNET BY A SAXON. O Blarney! Blarney, wonder-working gift! Why sat I never on the Blarney stone? To plodding Saxon, canny Scot unknown, What pen can paint, what skill its meaning sift? Paddy's safe shield in every adverse shift, His mirth is Blarney, Blarney is his moan; Priest, Peer, and Peasant, all its influence own, In Love Persuasive, Physic, Law, and Thrift. Sure as he's born a Celt, the little Rogue With mother's milk he sucks his Blarney in, As natural to him as his native brogue. Though, were I born in Connaught or Killarney, On this my theme I might an epic spin, How end my Sonnet?—Echo answers—Blarney!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. “IL SONNETTO.” He who constructs a sonnet must confine The metre strictly to its rule of rhyme; Throughout the quatrains, in well-order'd time, Two rhymes alone their harmony combine; These in two ways the verse may entertwine— (Such the fix'd rule in that Italian clime Whence sprung the sonnet)—two alternate chime— Or two responsive close each central line. Where end the quatrains pause, and pause again Between each triplet—here as pleaseth best Two rhymes suffice—or rang'd in sequence, three. Through the last six still let thy cautious pen Avoid a couplet, or, these rules transgress'd Thy fourteen lines will no true sonnet be. I. ON VISITING PETRARCH'S HOUSE. Mary! when we to Arqua's village came, Saw the rear'd tomb, the fountain's hallow'd rill, And climb'd the summit of that verdant hill Where Petrarch's dwelling bears the poet's name; When I beheld the crowded page proclaim, In varied tongue, unchanging homage still, The deathless praise that shall all ages fill, I sigh'd myself to share the poet's fame. Yet, ah! when I remember'd how in vain His lyre he strung to soften Laura's pride, Doom'd to a life of unrequited pain; Ah! Mary, then thy yielding hand I prest, Turn'd from that book to gaze upon my Bride, Nor car'd for Fame who was in Love so blest. III. THE CHAPEL BELL. Before my Hall I stood; with sated eye And heavy heart, upon the pile I gaz'd, Which care, and cost, and years of toil had rais'd, From turrets' base to glittering vane on high. Cold critics came, well pleased its faults to spy, Those very faults which smooth-tongued flattery prais'd, While country folk stood silent and amaz'd; “All,” my heart whisper'd, “all is vanity.” Hark! yonder bell bespeaks the hour of prayer, Far down the vale its gentle echoes steal, Bid youth from sport, and age from toil abstain; Won by that sound, if but one sinner kneel With humble heart and contrite spirit there— Glory to God!—not all, not all is vain. IV. ON AN OLD BARN CONVERTED INTO A Village School. Nigh the old Barn one autumn noon I stood. Huge ribs of oak its moss-grown roof upheld, Shap'd in rude fashion by the axe that fell'd That giant timber from the neighbouring wood. From waggons tost, ripe sheaves the floor bestrew'd, Loud mirth and laughter weariness dispell'd; “Home, harvest home!” the rustic chorus swell'd, And mingling voices still the strain renew'd. That barn now stands a village school, within Christ's little ones are welcom'd, there to learn How blest they live who to His guidance cling. Among this wheat no tares may Satan win. By angels gather'd to their Father's barn, This harvest home may seraph voices sing! V. ON CROSSING THE SIMPLON. O'er the bleak pass huge Alps their shadows throw, With lingering steps I climb the mountain way, While, lessening to their view, mine eyes survey With fond regret the sunlit vale below;— There, 'neath Italian skies ripe vineyards glow, Here scathèd pines a leafless grove display— There living streams through fruitful meadows stray, On barren crags here sleeps eternal snow. Alas! e'en thus the path of life we tread, Where pleasure lures us to the flower-strew'd plain, While virtue points the rough ascent we dread. O! that my soul unto my God were given, Cleans'd by His mercy from all earthly stain, Pure as yon snow that cleaves the vault of Heaven! VI. NAPLES AT SUNSET. Naples! where Virgil found his last repose, Where first his lyre the youthful Tasso strung, The sun's low radiance, o'er the waters flung, A golden halo round thy city throws. He sinks—and now each distant mountain glows Like purple drops from its own vintage wrung; Can the wide earth her fairest shores among A scene more lovely to his smile disclose? And Ocean lies submissive at thy feet, Won by thy charms unceasing homage pours, Loath to encroach, and powerless to retreat; His gentle waves, which but in whispers speak, Clinging as though enamour'd of thy shores, Like Love's fond lips to Beauty's witching cheek. VII. ON A DESECRATED CHAPEL NEAR Lausanne, now used as a Stable. Hard by a brook, whose stream Lake Leman feeds, A wayside chapel stands,—such seems it still; But strains devout no more its echoes fill, And thence unbless'd the passing pilgrim speeds; His toil-worn oxen, when he thither leads, At noon descending from the sun-scorch'd hill, Trac'd on that wall with rude but reverent skill, The sacred cross no more the peasant heeds. If with such joy rejoic'd the angels, when The ox was loof'd in Bethlehem's lowly shed, His crib the cradle of the Virgin-born; How must they weep to see, despis'd of men, The spot His presence blest, worn by the tread Of saints, that floor hoof-trampled and uptorn! VIII. ON THE CLOCK IN STRASBURG CATHEDRAL. The works of the Clock in Strasbourg Cathedral were reconstructed by J. B. Schwilgue, in 1842. As it strikes twelve, the cock, which surmounts one of the turrets, crows and extends his wings. Under a canopy in the centre are statuettes of the twelve apostles, which revolve round a figure of our Blessed Saviour. Due praise be his whose skill to Strasburg gave This master-piece of mechanism rare, More precious wisdom theirs whose daily care Is on their heart its homilies to grave. Peter at cockcrow wept—like him we have Denied our Lord, though sworn His cross to bear; Blest they who with him weep, and with him share The contrite spirit, which alone can save! Work ere night cometh, nor the time prolong; That voice which speaks in every ringing chime, Of mercy now, warns still of vengeance due. How many join that transept's midday throng With curious eye to mark the step of Time, To ponder on Eternity how few! IX. ON A DRAWING OF THE CRUCIFIXION STILL VISIBLE ON A DUNGEON WALL IN the Chateau de Chillon. Where, lake reflected, Chillon's turrets shine, Where treacherous pitfall lin'd with spike and blade, Beam, ring and pillar lurk in dreary shade, Of faith and hope, mark one enduring sign; Though faint, the eye may scan each lingering line, Trac'd by some hand which galling chain o'erlaid: The dying Saviour on the cross pourtray'd, Converts that cell into a holy shrine. Nor lone, nor friendless, such a captive deem, Fill'd with His image, whose abiding love To him was father, brethren, kindred, all! And still, while gazing on the narrow gleam Of azure sky, seen through the grated wall, Hope pointed heavenward to his home above. X. ON VISITING THE CASTLE AND CHURCH of Gruyère in Switzerland. The author gladly acknowledges that England is now no longer liable to the reproach which suggested this Sonnet, some twelve years ago. 1847. Where Gruyère's castle, rearing still on high Its silent halls and its untrodden stair, Looks down upon a village rude and bare, The cheerless home of hungering penury, Paining the heart of him who passeth by; A costly church, enrich'd with pious care, Amid those dwellings, echoing praise and prayer, Tells him that faith can poverty defy. Sadly I thought on many a lordly pile, Whose gilded walls unbounded wealth display, Uprear'd conspicuous in my native isle; The village church—its altar's mean array, Its font, its floor, which filth and damp defile, Alone uncared for, crumbling to decay. XI. ON THE RIVER TEPL, WRITTEN at the Freundschaft Saal, Carlsbad. Friendless I came, but friendless now no more; Thy voice, sweet river, greets me, and I trace A smile of welcome in thy sparkling face, When early morn invites me to thy shore; Thy sunlit waters to fresh life restore The fragrant flowers that gild the mountain's base; Lull'd by the rippling music of thy race, With tranquil happiness my heart runs o'er. The hues of heaven are mirror'd in thy stream; O! teach me so to live, that hope sublime, From Heaven reflected, on my path may beam! Thy ceaseless current runs to reach the sea; Teach me in wisdom to redeem the time, Still hastening onward to Eternity. XII. ON THE MARIEN CAPELLE, Carlsbad. One silver star with evening's twilight strove; Mid the dark pines, which base and summit hide, A lone lamp glimmer'd on the mountain side, As 'twere that star reflected from above; The chapel of the Virgin! cold in love, And proud of heart, forbear ye to deride; Judge not his conscience, nor a brother chide, Though to yourselves a stumbling-block it prove. On this pure spot, its shrine with offerings hung, Its rock by knees of suppliant pilgrims worn, Intruding—dare I prayerless hence depart? “Hail! Virgin mother, highly blest!” my tongue Repeats the salutation, while my heart Bows down in worship to the Virgin-born. XIII. THE LILY. Glory of flowers! pre-eminent o'er all, Thou white-rob'd lily, deck'd with pendant gold, What blest remembrance, as thy leaves unfold, To pure and humble hearts dost thou recall? Discarded emblem! o'er degenerate Gaul Waste we vain sighs? no longer as of old Her regal banner to the winds unroll'd, Weep we vain tears o'er chivalry's downfall? No! thy unsullied leaves nor strife, nor din, Of worldly warfare to the mind suggest; No wreath from thee earth's haughty conquerors win; Still seems Heaven's sainted Handmaid to invest Thy form with beauty, free from stain of sin, The Virgin Mother of all nations blest! XXIV. IL GELOSO. Name, thou who reignest mistress of my heart, Some deed to prove the fealty of thy knight, Some foeman, worthy of my lance, to fight, Some gift to fetch from earth's remotest mart; Or, not unskilful in the minstrel's art, If tuneful verse thy listening ear delight, Say, shall my pen from morn till eve indite Thy praise, and ceaseless song my bliss impart? If that I do be done alone by me, Exalted by thy love beyond all measure, What dare I not, what can I not for thee? But if another, tending on thy pleasure, Presume to serve, and so far favour'd be, Then fare thee well! my heart resigns its treasure. XV. THE TWO ROSES. These roses take, which rival hues invest, They tell how York and Lancaster of yore Their chosen badge to many a conflict bore, When England wept her bravest and her best. That strife is past, in peace those warriors rest; Waste not thy grief their struggles to deplore, Thy pity keep for that which needs it more— The strife now raging in my troubled breast. On thy fair forehead is the white rose shown, Thy lips the fragrance of its leaves impart, Its purity an emblem of thine own; When will that cheek unfold what I am seeking, The blush that tells me of thy yielding heart, The red-rose there love's victory bespeaking? XVI. ADDRESSED TO A LADY Who told me that, being ignorant of Botany, I could not enjoy my Garden. I love my garden, though I dare confess, While wandering free its fragrant flowers among, To me is pedantry that unknown tongue With which vain science mocks their loveliness. Perfume and flower I love, nor love I less The fluttering insect, whose light wings are hung With gold and purple, and the sweet lay sung By thousand birds who their protector bless. Think, thou who wrong'st me thus, how fondly I Gaze on thy features, though unskill'd to speak, In learnèd phrase, of their anatomy; I love the blush that mantles o'er thy cheek, I love the smile of welcome in thine eye, Nor how, nor whence; they come care I to seek. XVII. HOME. 'Twas midnight—midnight in a southern clime; The moon above the mountains—wood and stream And vineyard shining in her silvery beam, As in the sunlight of the morning's prime; The shade of fragrant orange-tree and lime Pierc'd through with twinkling stars; it seem'd a gleam Of Heaven o'erspreading earth, or poet's dream By fancy pictur'd in delusive rhyme. Though mist and darkness wrap our northern grove, No nightingale to charm the listening ear, Nor purple vines, nor cloudless moons above, For such I sigh not; this dark atmosphere Home gilds and gladdens with the light of love; There brighter skies, but fonder hearts are here. XVIII. THE CHRISTIAN MARTYR IN THE COLISEUM. “Christianos ad Leones.” Christian, come forth! the hungering lions crave Thy flesh; impatient waits assembled Rome, Athirst to drink the blood of martyrdom; Christian, come forth! and death unshrinking brave; Whether, within the walls of that vast grave, Torn limb from limb, or in the narrower tomb, Thy flesh foul worms and creeping things consume, A God thou hast omnipotent to save. Watch we and pray, lest us like foes o'erpower, Such, though unseen do not the less exist; Here stand we not in jeopardy each hour? That roaring lion, wheresoe'er he list, He walketh, seeking whom he may devour; Him may we, steadfast in the faith, resist! XIX. THE PENITENT. O god of goodness, Thou my hope and stay While yet I hung upon my mother's breast; Who watch'd the slumbers of mine infant rest, And with new strength endued me, day by day; In youth, in manhood, thro' my onward way In safety led, here in full measure blest, Of every joy this world can give possest, In mercy spar'd e'en when I went astray; No gift withheld that could affection win! What in return for such great love of thine, What have I done? my God, what have I been? I from my Father's house where all was mine, A prodigal, still adding sin to sin, Have wander'd far to feed on husks of swine. XX. ON A PICTURE OF A SPANISH LADY IN THE GALLERY AT MADRID. Most gifted limner! lifelike thus to trace That witching form I see before me yet, Unmask'd, those features none can e'er forget Who once have gaz'd upon that Spanish face. The close white vest o'erlaid with sable lace, The dark large eye, the hair of glossy jet, One simple rose within its tresses set; A portrait of rare loveliness and grace! Still, though amid its dignity be shown A latent look of unobtrusive mirth, Though scarce those lips can from a smile refrain, Erect she stands, as from Olympian throne Majestic Juno would have stood on earth— That glorious Lady of the land of Spain! XXI. ON THE LOSS OF THE “AVENGER.” 1847. The following account of the loss of the “Avenger” is extracted from the “Morning Herald.” “We were running at the rate of ten knots an hour, from Lisbon to Gibraltar, bound to Malta, when, on the night of 20th Dec., at four bells (10 o'clock), in the first watch, the ship suddenly struck on a reef of rocks. At this moment Capt. Napier was on the paddle-box, talking to the master. Lieut. Rooke, one of the survivors, was in his cabin, in the act of taking off his coat. The gunner (another survivor) ran on deck in a state of nudity. Immediately she struck, all hands rushed on deck; as they did so, she heeled over on her broadside, the mainmast fell across the paddle-box boat, and no doubt a number of those engaged in clearing it away were killed. The crew appeared completely paralysed; nothing was heard but now and then an exclamation, ‘Oh God! Oh God! we are all lost.’ Heavy seas swept over the vessel, and scarcely a man could retain his hold. The last seen of Lieut. Marryat was his being washed from his hold, and carried away, with some twenty more, to leeward. At last, Lieut. Rooke, the purser, second master, gunner, and four others, contrived to get into a quarter-boat. Here Providence interposed to save them; in lowering the boat the foremost fall got jammed, and the after one going freely, the boat had her stern in water and her bows in the air, when a jacket belonging to one of the men fortunately got into the sheave-hole of the after-fall, stopped it, and enabled them to cut the falls adrift. After pushing off from the wreck, they endeavoured to regain her, to render such assistance as was possible, and to pick up any of the crew: to approach her they found impossible. The wind blew a gale from the southward. The sea was very high, and breaking completely over her. After remaining as near as they could get for two hours, they bore away for Galita, distant about fourteen miles; an hour after they had done so, the wind suddenly shifted to the north, and blew harder than it had done from the other quarter. This compelled them to bear up again, which they did, for the coast of Barbary. On their way they passed the wreck, over which the sea was making awful sweeps. Soon after day-light they made the coast of Barbary, having run all night under a small lug-sail, and steered with an oar. In running the boat in, she grounded on a reef, and all hands were thrown out; the boy, however, regained the boat, kept to her, and drifted ashore alive. Of the remainder, only Lieut. Rooke, the gunner, and steward, were saved. The others perished in the surf. The Arabs treated them kindly, dried their clothes, and gave them warm milk. After a repose they walked 36 miles, till they could procure horses, on which they rode to Biserta. Here they received every hospitality from the governor and the consuls. A boat took them to Tunis, whence Sir T. Reade, the British Consul, sent a despatch to Malta. The Hecate started immediately for the fatal spot, whither the Bey of Tunis had already sent vessels, but not a vestige of the wreck remained. It is supposed that, with the shift of the wind, she heeled over into deep water and sunk. There are from 30 to 50 fathoms all round these rocks, which are steep to within a ship's length. The total number lost is 253.” What heart unmov'd, what eye without a tear, The fated ship can follow in her flight? As shoots a transient star through azure night, Such, on the ocean wave, her brief career. That bell's last tone awoke no boding fear; 'Mid busy thoughts, 'mid visions of delight, Wrapt in the past, or with the future bright, No sound, no sign, to warn that death was near. O fearful moment! stricken as she sped, Her keel rock-pierc'd, her hull asunder riven, The gallant ship bestrew'd the sweeping wave. An hour shall come more fearful yet, her dead The sea shall yield again; in mercy, Heaven, Then let their cry come unto Thee, and save! XXII.ON A LARK WHICH HAD ESCAPED FROM HIS CAGE. A cherish'd captive, ere thy tender wing As yet was fledg'd; through many a summer's day Thy song hath charm'd me with its thrilling lay; Still seem its echoes round thy cage to cling. In this thy narrow realm, a tiny king! Fierce warfare waging with thine insect prey; Crest, beak, and spur—crown, sword, and sceptre they, A turf thy emerald throne,—say, pamper'd thing, Yon flood of glory can thy sight sustain? With wing unpractis'd canst thou heavenward soar? Unaw'd by space renew thy wonted strain? Or, like some spirit unprepar'd to quit Its cage, the body, dost thou earth deplore? Thy voice, thy pinion, for the skies unfit?</field>
