      <field name="fulltext">Me verò primùm dulces ante omnia Musæ, Quarum sacra fero ingenti perculsus amore, Accipiant. ? Virgil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[VOL. I] [And hence, my Stella! from thy feeling breast] And hence, my Stella! from thy feeling breast Oft steals the fondness of a murmuring sigh, What time the cherub, downy-pinion'd Rest, The couch of anxious Care is doom'd to fly;— And oft (oh! painful to the generous heart To view the anguish of the soul we love!) Thy looks, expressive of the inward smart, The frowns of wayward Destiny reprove, While from the languid eye affection's glow Efulgent beams, suffus'd with tearful woe. Ah! yet again Hygeia! yet return— For thee I'll wakeful tune the matin song; No more on high my watchful lamp shall burn, Startling the midnight silence, to prolong The 'laborate search; for dull as chaos prove (Thy smile refus'd) clear truth and radiant fame; Dull as the night of ignorance!—and Love— Love's balmy touch, that joys the healthful frame, The painful nerve of saddest sympathy Alone can move, while all his roses die! His genial torch no more the cheerful rays That gild the fane of social Mirth can boast; But faint a melancholy gleam displays— (Its radiance faded, and its incense lost!)— A sullen lamp thro' the funereal dome That sheds its lustre o'er the sculptur'd name Of joys low mouldering in the cheerless tomb. Return then, roseate nymph! this drooping frame, Woe-worn, renew with thy ethereal flame. So shall the Muse intrusive care forego, And Grief no more—dim Grief! while sighs the gale Of love-instructed fears, her misty veil, O'er fond Affection's brow shall envious throw, Her smiles to cloud, and check her radiant glow. [—Immortal Sages!] —Immortal Sages! Ye noblest benefactors of mankind! Unworthy as I am to lift my soul To thoughts of your beatitude, or hope, In this degenerate superstitious age, To emulate your glories, and revive Those awful traits of unassuming wisdom, Those precepts, whose simplicity of thought Evinc'd the true sublime! O! let me, yet, Indulge my raptur'd fancy for a while With your high converse; and the fond idea Sate with the glorious vision, as I roam Forgetful of the world, its systems vain, And all the crude conceits of bigot Folly, Whose rage embroils, and thins the human race! And thou, majestic Athens! thou blest nurse Of Arts and Knowledge, Liberty and Taste! Under whose free invigorating laws The giant-soul of heav'n-enlighten'd man (Uncramp'd by tyrant badges of distinction, Which virtue own'd not, nor which merit claim'd.) Swell'd, tow'ring swell'd, to due proportion'd strength, And left the pigmy slaves of future courts With base despair to wonder at its greatness, And mourn their fall, degenerate!—Say wilt thou, Glory of ancient Freedom! say wilt thou Permit me, on this rustic theatre, While bold “Imagination bodies forth” The god-like actors, here to represent (Myself and heaven spectators of the scene) The awful drama of thy mental greatness. These fields, these hedge-rows, and this simple turf, Shall form my Academus: through this vale, (Ye hallow'd manes of the boasts of Greece!) Thro' this low vale will I suppose ye walk'd Pouring divine instruction, or, reclin'd Upon these verdant hillocks, musing deep, The silent energy of soul collected, And soar'd, on Contemplation's awful wing, Into the highest heaven. Plato here His mystic visions, daringly sublime! Perhaps might have reveal'd; the subtile soul Of far-fam'd Aristotle, musing here, Might pierce the mazy labyrinth, and unfold Nature's mysterious laws: there Socrates— Divine old man!—Wisdom's transcendent boast! And Patriot Virtue's most undaunted guide!— With strong, persuasive plainness might define The source of morals, and the eternal laws Of heav'n-descended Truth—best friend of man! Or, soaring to the highest stretch of thought, Reveal what'er dull sense can comprehend Of worlds more blest—futurity—and GOD! [“To calm Reflection's sober train] “To calm Reflection's sober train, “Each plant a useful lesson gives: “A moralizer on the plain “Each turf and smiling blossom lives.” Such, while my infant fancy strove Against Misfortune's sullen power, And oft, in mead or smiling grove, Pensive I rov'd the lonely hour. Such were the notes, to lull my woe, When first I wak'd the rustic string, Blest Contemplation taught to flow, While o'er me wav'd her seraph wing. And trust me nymph or gentle swain Who haunt the stream or shadowy dell, Experience has confirm'd the strain Which early tun'd my pensive shell. 'Tis not alone the letter'd friend, The busy world's instructive throng, That can the useful lesson lend, That lengthens Wisdom's vary'd song. Go, hear the raging billow roar, Go, mark the swiftly-changing cloud, Or trace some rivulet's winding shore, Some lowly vale, or mountain proud, Or plung'd within some forest's shade, Whose mingled boughs exclude the day,— There shalt thou meet the heav'n-born maid, And hear, entranc'd, her sacred lay. [Sweet attic warbler! poet of the skies!] Sweet attic warbler! poet of the skies! To thee not vainly comes the genial Spring To give a sordid joy. Thy little breast, Fond as it flutters with returning glow, Quivers the strain of rapture, which imparts Congenial transport to attentive man, And pays the bounteous season, with its song, For the kind boon her cheering smile bestows. Wake, sons of earth! who boast superior souls, And hail the healthful gales with equal gratitude, And give to other hearts the bliss ye feel. The season teems instruction; and each gale Pregnant with lib'ral blessings, far-diffus'd, Whispers the strain of soul-expanding love— Of love etherial! such whose genial tear, Roll'd down the cheek of cherub-thron'd Compassion, Melts the obdurate frost of stern distress, And gives the stream of hope again to flow. Yes, all is hope, and gratitude, and joy! Murmurs this prattling rill—whose margeant turf Drinks from its lucid urn a livelier hue— Murmurs it not of peace and thankful praise? Teems not the herbage thick with grateful dew? Which, heaven-ascending, decks the radiant face Of yonder azure sky, that sheds its smiles To cheer the wak'ning verdure, and adorn With gay enamel all its foodful turf! Ah! joins not all—all Nature's gen'ral voice To swell the chorus of yon strain of joy? Then pour—sweet poet of the radiant morn! Pour thy loud hymn of rapture on the ear Of All-bestowing Providence! nor cease Till Philomela, from the list'ning woods, With other strains relieve thy wearied throat: Strains seeming sad, and solemn as the hour; Though yet of like devotion with thy own: Instructive her's of resignation's charm, And thine instinct with gratitude and love! [Though, loudest of the feather'd choir] Though, loudest of the feather'd choir Alauda The Lark. pour the vocal strain, To heav'n, with raptur'd wing, aspire, And, floating through the etherial plain, Call up the radiant East to raise The choral song of pious praise; Yet shall the stork, whose grateful wing Aloft the feeble parent bears, (What though no labour'd strain she sing!) And kindly shares, And sooths his cares; Or she, whose fond maternal breast To all the younglings of her nest Pours, nutritive, the vital stream, (Though ne'er she sail'd, with stately pride, Down warbling Pindus's sacred tide, To join the muse's hallow'd lays, And heav'n-ward waft the song of praise,) More bask in Heav'n's approving beam. Then, as in the social sphere Man a wider range enjoys, Let his hallow'd zeal appear In the blessings it supplies. Vain the Wood-lark's hermit's strain, Musing through the lone retreat; Vain the sweet aspiring vein Of yon minstrel, warbling sweet; Vain, alike, the hymn, the pray'r, Pride's full-oft, or Sloth's pretence: Would you Heaven's best favour share, Be your suit—benevolence! Whence, as from the genial beam, Darting o'er the humid ground, Fruitful blessings ever teem, Realms, and smiling worlds around! [Thee, vital beam! fair Virtue's guide!] Thee, vital beam! fair Virtue's guide! And terror of the guilty soul, From Heav'n's immortal throne supply'd Fear's haggard empire to controul! Thee, thee I hail! the emblem fair Of sacred Truth's eternal charm— Whose glance appals with swift despair Tyrannic Fraud's oppressive arm! Thee, whom the felon dreads to view, As tyrants dread fair Reason's ray! Thee will I hail, with rev'rence due, Protectress of my lonely way. Then cast, fair beam! thy radiant spell around, By which the ruffian's hardy sinew fails, His iron soul in magic fetters bound, While conscious dread o'er each stern thought prevails. [Ah! keen the pang of friendless Woe] Ah! keen the pang of friendless Woe, When Want impels the falt'ring tongue Its modest silence to forego, And supplicate the passing throng! Ah, keen the pang, if cold Neglect Avert the inauspicious eye, With seeming scorn the suit reject, And check the sympathetic sigh! [But come, fair Freedom, heav'n-born maid!] But come, fair Freedom, heav'n-born maid! Shake off Corruption's sordid chain, And, in thy native smiles array'd, The artist cheer and drooping swain. Let Pride no more, in pamper'd state, Exulting in an empty name, On trampled crowds her throne elate, And Labour's honest earnings claim. No more let Britons, bought and sold By venal Party's selfish art, The mockery of thy form behold, And feel Oppression's real smart. But shew thy energetic soul, And in thy awful frowns appear: Those frowns that tyrant Pride controul, And thrill Corruption's nerve with fear. Let false Distinction's pageant flee: Be worth and parts alone rever'd: Let ev'ry Briton feel he's free, And ev'ry freeman's voice be heard. Then Labour's solitary ewe Luxurious courts shall sieze no more. Then Plenty shall her smiles renew, And Misery fly the British shore! [Daughters of Albion's gay enlighten'd hour!] Daughters of Albion's gay enlighten'd hour! Hail the sweet strains your captive warblers pour; Their graceful forms and downy plumage prize, And the gay lustre of their varied dyes; Nor ever think, while tremulous they sing, Or flutt'ring spread the glossy-tinctur'd wing, That fluttering wing, that tremulated strain Of lingering griefs, and cruel bonds complain: Nor ever think—that, for a sordid joy, Their hopes, their rights, affections ye destroy; Doom them the air's unbounded space to change, For the dull cage's loath'd, contracted range; There, every social throb condemn'd to mourn Which each sad summer bids in vain return. Daughters of Albion's gay enlighten'd day! To man alike your sympathy display! Heedless of groans, of anguish, and of chains, Of stripes inflicted, and tormenting pains, At morn, at eve, your sweeten'd beverage sup, Nor see the blood of thousands in the cup. What though each sweet effluvium, ere it rise, Have clogg'd the western gale with Afric's sighs, Each sweeten'd drop yon porc'lain cell contains, Was drawn, O, horror! from some brother's veins; Or, wrought by chemic art, on terms too dear, Is but transmuted from some negro's tear, Which dropt, 'midst galling bonds, on foreign strand, His bride still answers from his native land!— Still turn indiff'rent from these foreign woes, Nor suffer griefs so distant to oppose The sickly taste, whose languid pulse to cheer Two rifled worlds must drop the bitter tear!— For what is Afric, what the Eastern Ind To Europe's race, by polish'd arts refin'd? Or why should pamper'd Luxury enquire Who by the sword, or by the lash expire? Daughters of Albion, still this path pursue! Be sense and appetite your only aim: From prostrate Pity turn the giddy view, And gracious Mercy's pleading voice disclaim. Meanwhile with feeble step and mincing tone, Pretend to softness, delicacy, love! High place yourselves on Admiration's throne, While fancied graces round obsequious move: Whence (while for wretches, for your tastes aggriev'd, Ye slight each effort to obtain redress) Lisp forth, to those by whom 'twill be believ'd, Your tender feeling's exquisite excess! [Commerce! thou doubtful, and thou partial good!] Commerce! thou doubtful, and thou partial good! 'Tis true by thee we swell to Wealth and Power; And Britain's name, and Britain's arts by thee Are wafted to each region of the Globe, Bringing, in rich return, their varied tributes Of wealth and elegance, and the rare boon To which, o'er all, we owe the power to soar Above the brute, toward the god-like frame Of heaven-pervading natures—glorious science! Man's noblest privilege! But then by thee— (With grief the muse records it) oft by thee War, savage War! too, lifts his brazen voice, To bellow hideous discord through the World; To deluge guiltless realms with native blood, At mad Ambition's and at Avarice' call; 'Gainst human woe to steel the human breast, Inflame the rancour of compatriot strife, And press Oppression's foot with fiercer wrath On the bow'd neck of Misery's fallen race. 'Tis thine, too, Commerce, thro' thy native land To pour, wide-wasting, like a deluge, round The poison'd stream of Luxury, rank-poluted! The monster breeding Nile of hideous vice, From whose oft stagnant pools incessant spring A loath'd mishapen swarm, which Nature's eye Turns haggard to behold. Thou, Commerce, too, monopolizing fiend! Fatten'st a few upon the toils of all; And while thy favour'd sons, in Parian domes, Rival the pomp of regal splendour, lo! In every town whose charter'd insolence Barters to Britain's sons the Freeman's name, If there thy throne is fix'd, what hundreds throng Each sad retreat of Wretchedness, or fill The public streets with wants' afflictive plaint; Mourning thy fickle and capricious sway, Whose endless changes, tho' the rich not feel, (For Protean gold will ever find employ) Oft robs the pale mechanic of his bread, And dooms the pensioner of diurnal toil, For half the year, perhaps, to idle want; Perhaps in age to learn a new employ. Ode to the American Republic. Yes, child of Britain! soul of flame! Whose energetic valour rose Triumphant o'er Oppression's woes To unknown heights of Freedom's aweful fame! Yes, thou, who first the brazen yoke Of loath'd distinctions, false! and vain! And Privilege's tyrant chain, By Wisdom's voice inspir'd, indignant broke! Thou, thou to Britain's parent clime (That made thee, by oppression, free) Shalt waft the gallant thought sublime That pants for genuine liberty! Tho' reverend Error's slow disease Her age's doating vitals freeze, Yet thou shalt send the healing balm Which (like Medea's boasted charm) The enfeebling ill shall soon dismiss, And renovate Britannia's bliss. [Dear social dome, from whom awhile] Dear social dome, from whom awhile, With truant steps, I rove, That so at eve thy cheerful smile May more endearing prove! That so, as my eccentric feet Through wilds and woodlands stray, Or quit awhile the lone retreat, Life's follies to survey, What scenes in human life prevail And Nature's varying hues, May lengthen out the cheerful tale, Thy circle to amuse. To thee, thus pleas'd, and gay at heart, My anxious step returns, The day's adventures to impart, While blithe the faggot burns. [O Grief! how oft thy wizard-touch, malign] O Grief! how oft thy wizard-touch, malign, On the fair form of youthful manhood laid, Bids every graceful energy decline, And all the blooms of vernal promise fade! Thy blasting power not Lucio's self could shun: Lucio, now mouldering in the silent tomb, The race of mental glory born to run— Could early worth foretel the ripening doom. His cultur'd mind, his elegance of form, Sunk—ling'ring sunk beneath thy gloomy sway, Nor left a heart so gen'rous, or so warm, To mourn his sorrows, and his worth display. Nor shall the roses on the cheek I love (If e'er thy breath, O stygian pow'r! they feel) Or eyes, whose beams the kindling bosom move, The winning graces of the soul reveal! And see where Belmour, “bending o'er his tread,” Steals in sad negligence from human view, Prone o'er the turf declines his waving head, As o'er the grave some dark funereal yew. The folded arms, the heaving breast declare, And mutter'd plaints that mock the hollow wind, The once-gay fav'rite of the smiling fair To wild'ring woe and maniac pangs resign'd. Fled is the lustre of that piercing eye Which beam'd invention, dignity, and taste! Lost ev'ry pow'r that wak'd the social joy! Each feature faded! and each charm effac'd! How must the soul that, 'midst the kindred throng, Oft hail'd the sprightly graces of his mien, Weep to behold him pensive glide along The wand'ring ghost of what he once has been! [Thee, Queen of pensive Visions! to whose ear] Thee, Queen of pensive Visions! to whose ear Sad Philomela pours her nightly moan, While far-diffus'd thy modest beams appear O'er hills, vales, groves, and purling riv'lets thrown— Thee, nurse of thought!—or if thy silver ray Break through the fleecy-margin'd clouds, serene, Between the Aspine's trembling leaf to play, Or spread thy light o'er Ocean's boundless scene,— Or if, sublime! one spacious orb of fire, Behind the eastern wave thou risest slow, Confronting, while his dazzling wheels retire, The varied tints of Day's expiring glow— Thee, placid Queen! whatever tint be thine, Thee will I woo, while solemn Silence reigns; Thee, whose mild lustre sheds the calm divine That wild emotion's painful throb restrains! And, O, 'tis thine, with thought-subliming ray, To wake the seraph power that wings the soul To heights unthought amidst the garish day, Beyond the bounds that Vision's orb controul. Thine, too, to lead to Inspiration's spring The Muse, sweet soother of my pensive hours! To plume afresh young Fancy's tow'ring wing, And give to magic verse sublimer powers. [O Reason! “first-created beam!”] O Reason! “first-created beam!” That through the night of Chaos broke, And pour'd the plastic vital stream Whence form and beauteous order woke!— O Reason! first-created beam! Existing Nature's boundless soul! Dart through this cloud thy cheerful gleam, And ev'ry gloomy fear controul. O! put the shadowy train to flight That stalk in Terror's dubious night, And ev'ry wild'ring thought restrain That racks the Sceptic's throbbing brain! [Then hail! fair Reason's golden ray!] Then hail! fair Reason's golden ray! That, chasing Superstition's gloom, Restores of Truth the peaceful day, And gives each mental joy to bloom! To thee, true Virtue's only friend! Be my implicit reverence given: To thee, may every Passion bend, And own the genuine voice of Heaven! [For sweet, when Morning streaks the vernal sky] For sweet, when Morning streaks the vernal sky, To quit the oblivious couch of dull repose, Mark in light troops the scatter'd shadows fly, And all the azure pomps of heav'n disclose; And sweet to hear from ev'ry dripping thorn, (Whose dew-drops glitter in the early ray,) Or high in air, on russet pinions borne, The joyous song that hails returning day! And sweet, ascending to the verdant brow Of some proud hill, to cast the eye around O'er reeking vales and meadows stretch'd below, That seem like lakes—in teeming vapour drown'd! But ah! nor vernal sky, nor blushing dawn, Nor scatt'ring clouds, nor azure vault on high, Nor linnet warbling from the glittering thorn, Nor soaring lark that wakes the strain of joy; No; nor the prospect from the swelling height Of reeking valleys spread like lakes below, Nor all the pleasures of the ravish'd sight Like friendly Converse wake the raptur'd glow! This the true Hermes who, with feather'd heel, Flits unfatigued along the lengthen'd way, And bears the wand of Science, to reveal Whate'er of Wisdom in the path may lay. Then Friendship come, and with thy soothing lore New charms o'er every vernal scene diffuse, The landscape gild, the human heart explore, And prompt the fervours of a moral muse! [Still asthe young Enthusiast I pursue] Still asthe young Enthusiast I pursue, And eager trace his lonely wanderings wild, Fresh rise the haunted scenes to Fancy's view Which oft the throbbings of this heart beguil'd; Through which the Muse, full oft, in pensive mood, Has led me, 'raptur'd, all the livelong day, (Charm'd with wild Nature's works, sublimely rude!) To point the moral, and attune the lay:— Where oft, in ecstasies of mournful thought, Enthusiast Fancy rush'd upon my soul, And tun'd the airy harp, whose whispers taught The force of gloomy passions to controul:— Where, of the sordid World forgetful grown, Its wants, its cares, its slanders, and its hate, By Meditation's friendly aid alone, I snatch'd a boon amidst the frowns of fate. O! bowers of Enfield!—Woods, and wilds, and streams, Whose mazy wanderings spread enchantment round; Where oft, protected from the noon-tide beams, These limbs have stretch'd along the mossy ground; Where oft the Lark has call'd me up to roam, And lose in Nature's charms Misfortune's pain; Till Evening's pensive songster warn'd me home; Yet held me list'ning to her mournful strain. O bowers of Enfield! and thou bushy dell, Beside whose runnels as I wont to rove My trembling fingers first attun'd the shell To notes responsive of neglected love!— There too, oft loitering in the darkling glade, The moral Muse that sung Amanda's woe Frequent I wooed, the mournful theme to aid, And teach my infant numbers how to flow. O bowers of Enfield! which some future lay Shall sing—Might Heav'n permit the song to live. O!—dear-remember'd bowers and riv'lets! say To me what joys could rural nature give. And thou! gay Surry!—thou, whose pastur'd lawns, Clear-smiling brooks, and gently-sloping hills, Luxuriant verdure's gayest tint adorns, While thro' each grove the sweetest music trils!— Thee, Queen of Beauty! whose enamell'd vales And graceful foliage Thames delights to view, While o'er his channel crowd the sportive sails Thy winding bounds, luxuriant, to pursue;— Thee, from thy throne, on Richmond's beauteous height, Where streams, groves, villas, at thy footstool lay, Will I invoke, to say with what delight Among thy smiling scenes I wont to stray. For thou hast seen me oft, at Evening hour, Thy wild-wood flowrets twining round my head, With fixt regard each glowing tint devour By waining Phœbus o'er the welkin spread:— And thou hast mark'd me, in the woodland scene, With infant fingers cull the mossy store, And still, with meditative smile serene, Each various product's various hues explore:— But chief where'er the silver-fretted brook Pour'd its low cadence, hast thou seen me stray, To mark its eddies oft, with pensive look, While glanc'd the noon-tide, or the Lunar ray. [Hail, Meditation! modest maid!] Hail, Meditation! modest maid! Who rov'st full oft, in thoughtful mood, By haunted brook, or shadowy glade, Or o'er the heath-clad mountain rude To meet the Muse, wild Fancy's child! Companion of thy pensive hours; Who glads the dark-hued forest wild, And decks the barren wold with flow'rs. And as ye, thus, Enthusiast Pair! In mental converse loitering stray, And Nature's cheering beauties share, Instruction beams to gild your way: Nor, yet, external scenes alone The moralizing theme impart— Your searching glances, inward thrown, Correct the feelings of the heart. For who with serious eye can view Those scenes the Muse delights to hail, Or Meditation's flight pursue, Nor feel the generous thought prevail? From Nature's hand on all around (Meads graz'd by flocks, and choral shades) Since Love's benignant stamp is found, And Sympathy thro' all pervades. Ah! sure, if all to human kind Their tributary blessings bring, To glad the sense, or sooth the mind, Or vibrate pleasure's genial string— Ah! sure, where'er a nerve is found To feel delight, or suffer woe, There Man, by every tie, is bound Or this to ward, or that bestow. Then let me, sweet Enthusiasts! moan; Nor check the tear ye taught to fall; That future feelings may atone For scenes I can no more recall. And let the Woodlark's plaintive trill, And her's who charms the twilight grove, Their mournful lessons oft instill, And virtue's tender pang improve. [“Then give me, Nymph! the unbought smile] “Then give me, Nymph! the unbought smile, More sweet than Grandeur ever knew, Which gilds the heart, and cheers the toil Of those who Wisdom's path pursue. Yes, Pleasure! yes—by Wisdom's side Thou shed'st thy brightest, purest ray, While envious clouds innoxious glide, Nor interrupt thy genial day: Nor wilt thou, from thy modest throne, With chilling scorn, disdain to bend To suitors who, to Wealth unknown, In homely weeds thy train attend. No:—They, the slaves of empty State, Who wooe thee, Nymph, in gilt array, Aloof in anti-chambers wait, Nor e'er thy radiant form survey; While they, with philosophic air, Who noise, nor shew, nor fashion heed, Within, thy partial favours share— To Virtue's sons alone decreed. Then give me, Nymph! the unbought smile, More sweet than Grandeur even knew, Which gilds the heart, and cheers the toil Of those who Wisdom's path pursue.” TO THE LARK. “Hail lofty Pindar of the feather'd choir! Whether at Heaven's blest gate, on mattin wing, Soaring thou warblest, when young Maï first Pours forth the gay luxuriance of her dies, And hill and valley smile with sudden bloom.— “Whether blithe soaring o'er the waving field, Where bounteous Ceres pours forth all her store, Veiling glad Nature's form in living gold, Thy pipe, unfailing, roves through every change, Lofty or soft, of melody divine.— “Or whether, 'scaping from the fatal tube, What time the plunder'd stubble dusky mourns, Still, Attic songster! to the listning soul Thy strain shall warble gratitude and love!” [What needs the lofty-vaulted dome] What needs the lofty-vaulted dome, Where Grandeur draws the breath of pride; Or spacious grove's exotic gloom, Where labour'd streams are taught to glide? What needs the splendid couch of state? Its silken hangings? beds of down? Or piles of herald-sculptur'd plate, That oft the wasteful table crown? On his hard palate stretch'd, at eve, See labour's opiate lull the swain! Or see him pleas'd, at noon, receive With grateful heart, his viands plain! What is it, then,—Ye great ones say— Your ostentation would impart, That may not gild the rustic day, And cheer the peasant's honest heart? Is't Health (her cheeks with roses spread)? Or Joy that gilds the favour'd mind? Lo! these, beneath the lowliest shed, The honest rustic knows to find! His narrow cabins not exclude The guest your spacious chambers woo; Nor homely walls, however rude, Shut beauteous splendor from his view: For, wasted on the zephyr's wing, Free thro' his open casement glides The rosy nymph, while perfum'd Spring Around in cheerful pomp presides. And, as for bliss!—What is it? Say— Ye who the palm of knowledge claim— If e'er with man 'twere known to stray: What is't but Virtue's other name? [Far, far away, ye little homely sheds!] Far, far away, ye little homely sheds! Far from this period be the baneful hour When proud Improvement thro' the region spreads, Builds o'er each spot, and fells each rustic bower! Here still may honest Industry retreat, Here Poverty still breathe the untainted gale, The rude ear listen to the carol sweet, And join the strain the vernal year to hail! Here may the lark (for here the lark still sings) And Philomel (for Philomel is here— And oft what time her plaint of sorrow rings Thro' the lone shrubbery, soothes my pensive ear.) Here may the lark, and Philomela's strain, (Joy's gayest note and sorrow's sweetest flow!) One rouse to labour still the lowly swain, One soothe till slumber steeps his weary brow. Nor let refining Grandeur grudge this spot— This nook obscure to Indigence and Toil, Where humbly bowing to their abject lot, Health yet may cheer them with her blooming smile! [Who can behold great Nature's awful face] Who can behold great Nature's awful face, Her form majestic, and her varied grace;— See through mid air yon orb refulgent stray, And pour on smiling realms the flood of Day; Or when still Night becalms the pensive soul, See silver lamps in countless myriads roll;— Mark heaving Ocean, while his tempests roar, Or the slow lapse steals murmuring from the shore;— See Earth's broad bosom, with perennial pride, With various stores her various race provide; Or mark, while round these obvious stores she deals, What secret stores her verdant robe conceals:— Who these can view?—Nay; who the turf, the flower That decks the field, or scents the mantling bower,— The smallest insect-tenant of the spring That creeps on earth, or buzzes on the wing, Who can behold—and blind to Reason's laws, Not mount to THEE? thou FIRST ALMIGHTY CAUSE! But, if bold Science her assistance lend— If to her deep recesses we descend— If there the tome mysterious we explore, Of Nature's genuine theologic lore, What wider fields of wisdom and delight Unfold their beauties to our ravish'd sight! Thro' which, with reverent wonder, we pursue Creation's course, and Heaven's own footsteps view! [See where the heart, life's awful reservoir?] See where the heart, life's awful reservoir? That pours to every part the vital store,— Great seat of Passion, at whose proud controul Or slow, or wild the purple torrents roll— (Now thrilling quick when, all the soul on fire, Eyes the bright nymph, and pants with warm desire, Now creeping slowly thro' the sluggish veins When chilling Fear, or drooping Sorrow reigns)— This awful power, on whom high heaven conferr'd Of life's great charge the first The circulation of the blood being essential long before the functions of the lungs or brain are requisite. important third!— Timid, and conscious of her charge, she flies To pant and flutter far from human eyes; While the soft lungs, in flexile membrane bound, Like fond maternal wings embrace her round: And, while the current thro' each channel In the human subject, and all the most perfect of the quadruped species, the whole mass of blood passes in every circulation through the lungs, swells, Woo the fresh zephyrs to their countless cells; And, ere again the imprison'd gales retire, Draw from their souls the pure electric fire That the air in passing through the lungs, loses some part of its elementary composition is evident, because, after it has been respired a given number of times, it is no longer fit for its purpose of sustaining life; becoming, in fact, less and less fit for that office at every repeated inspiration. It is equally evident from the changes taking place in the colour and properties of the blood, in its passage through the pulmonary arteries, that something is imbibed from the air. Whether this be certain portions of the electric fluid, contained always in large quantities in the atmosphere, may, perhaps, be worth enquiry. The author hazards it only as a conjecture sufficiently probable for the foundation of a poetical allusion.— The electric fire the passing streams impart (Life's first great mover) to the swelling heart. Should rude disaster these or that confound, Life and Life's hope fly rapid from the wound: Here 'scape the currrents whence we life receive, The zephyrs there by which those currents live. But these to guard from ills that might assail, Spread the strong ribs, their moving coat of mail, And stretch'd around, with strong, but flexile sweep, At distance due each casual danger keep. Nor less the brain—fair Reason's awful stand! Whose subtile dictates all the frame command; Doom'd each important function to sustain; Mysterious “Lord of Pleasure and of Pain,” Of Reason, Knowledge, Sense's varied sway, And Fancy's train—fantastic, grave, or gay. Where vibrates sound, where splendid Vision lives, Where Taste—where Smell her essence all receives, And Touch, fine-thrilling, each impression gives! From this, when injur'd, all tumultuous fly The wond'rous train of sudden Sympathy: The sympathy between the Brain, Heart, and Lungs has long engaged the attention of Physiologists, it being evident, that no injury whatever can be done to the one without the others being immediately affected. The Lungs, the Heart, their functions each disclaim: Dies thro' each Nerve the paralytic frame! But this to guard, with numerous joints The exposed situation of the head, and the importance and sensibility of the organ it contains, necessarily called for every possible precaution; and, accordingly, Nature has not only provided it with bones of such strength as forcibly to resist the violence that may be offered it, but has also made a provision, by the many small portions into which these bones are divided, to prevent such wounds as may be inflicted from easily extending to any considerable length. supplied, Lo! in firm compact, swells the crested pride, Whose lines prescrib'd the spreading evil bound, When Force or Chance inflicts the dangerous wound. Thus stands erect proud Man's superior race, Secur'd by cautious Nature's partial grace: Each vital part, to guard life's sacred fire, Arm'd at all points, defies Misfortune's ire. But, ah! in vain: for Art, with cruel zeal, Delves the rent earth, and whets the vengeful steel: Or, with invention's magic powers accurst, Bids from wrought tubes th'ignited malice burst; Whence, low on Earth the glorious structure lays, Fall'n in its strength, and ere its hour decays. [Nor here forgets (as cheerful we aspire] Nor here forgets (as cheerful we aspire, And see below the distant town retire) The friendly Hermes o'er the winding way His wings and sage caduces to display. My gay companion, skill'd in Gothic lore, Opes at each step his topographic store: What scatter'd hamlets catch the distant eye, Or hid in neighbouring thickets viewless lie, Or, half embower'd, o'er waving woods display The spire bright glittering in the morning ray, Their piles of mouldering state—each founder's name, Their scenes of ancient sport, or martial fame, Pleas'd he recounts, while mile succeeding mile Flits light behind, and golden prospects smile. Chief of the scenes that thus to notice throng, Lo! ancient Eltham claim the varied song:— Eltham whose towers, in age's stern decay, And smiling woods, in vernal foliage gay, Late (fond of scenes renown'd in times of yore) My feet eccentric wander'd to explore; Midst ivy'd ruins, wrapt in thought, to rove, And woo the moralizing Muse I love: For many a change these fallen towers have view'd O'er which the mournful fancy loves to brood! And well their mouldering honours may display The vain parade of Grandeur's fickle sway. For here, o'er Gothic Splendour's fallen seat, Where plodding cits erect the snug retreat— Where the tame drudge of six successive days, His Sunday's coat and rural taste displays;— Demure to church, with wig of snow parades, The gaze of clowns and antiquated maids; Who now, no more of flattering beaux the care, Hide in these shades their spleen and their despair; With cards and prayer-books soothe their wrinkled brows, And pour at Scandal's shrine, their frequent vows;— Yes, here (where grinning Humour hies to seek Her country gentleman of once a week,) Once the proud tyrants of the groaning land Grasp'd the stern sceptre with ensanguin'd hand; While haughty Barons, factious, rude, and sour, (At once the props and rivals of their pow'r!) Throng'd round in gaudy pomp, and daily vied In scenes of riot, insolence, and pride; While fierce Oppression, with her iron rod, Dogg'd at their heels, and waited at their nod. Ye fallen turrets, now in fragments spread, Or doom'd to patch the rustic's humble shed!— Ye rocky fragments of each ruin'd pile That guarded once the robber and his spoil! Ye, ye could tell (might heaven a voice afford) Full many a crime of many a savage lord, When thirst of blood, and violence were fame, And abject myriads trembled at a name, Or groan'd despis'd in flavery's galling chain, A master's boundless riot to maintain, And bled to soothe (nor dar'd to deem unjust) His fierce ambition, or his fiercer lust! Nor rests the guilt, that this abhorrence calls, Within the martial chiefs embattled walls; For holy cheats, the pests of every clime! Made heaven itself a partner in the crime; With hopes of easy penance urg'd the soul To bolder guilt, and bade the stern controul Of aweful Conscience vanish, and the train Of fell Remorse, that rack the wildering brain, And call the phantom'd furies from the deep Where Fear and Horror endless vigils keep To haunt diseas'd Remembrance. These behold The pious jugglers, for corrupting gold, With drops of magic dew, and mutter'd spell, Submissive conjure to their native cell; In cloister'd walls while heavenly visions rise To cheer with blissful hopes the murderer's eyes! Within yon fane (to prop whose shapeless pile What distant ages lend their pious toil— Whose rude ill-match'd materials scarcely save Its mouldering Tombs from one oblivious grave— But still whose reverend arch, of Gothic frame, To far antiquity asserts the claim.)— Yes, there, perhaps, within yon tottering fane, The British purple's most detested stain, Inhuman John! a trembling suppliant stood, His hand still palsied with a nephew's blood, Till hireling priests the sacred unction pour, And all his bosom's pious peace restore: While groaning subjects, by his crimes undone, With added burthens for his guilt atone; And hard-wrung subsidies the boon supply That gives him back to Innocence and Joy! [If the glad heart of Friendship, or the soul] If the glad heart of Friendship, or the soul Of Merit pining in Misfortune's power Feel, when from Bounty's hand her blessings show'r, The kindling transport thro' the bosom roll— If these, not conscious of the art to hide The inward feeling, from the speaking eye Beam the glad smile, or more delighted tear, Heaven! to what height must swell the generous tide Of glowing extasy!—how the fine joy Like thy own glorious radiance must appear To decorate his brow, who with the will Combines the power the wanted bliss to deal! Oh! with what joy his conscious heart must thrill!— Sole joy which human Virtue ne'er can feel Without the aid of Fortune!—Yet how few Of those who bask in her meridian smile Have sense to seize this sole prerogative Which Wealth and Power can challenge!—Ah! how few Prefer to mingling in each sordid joy, Which every hind indulges in his way, The generous luxury that lifts the head Of pining genius from the abject dust, And shews the real splendour of their state! [For here, while Phœbus sheds the radiant beam] For here, while Phœbus sheds the radiant beam, Imperial Thames, with more majestic sweep, Wafts the fraught vessel o'er a wider stream, And pours a flood of glory to the deep. See where, against the horizon's distant bound, Itself a sea, the wide-spread wave reclines, While fading hues the mingled scene confound, Nor wave from sky the sharpen'd ken defines; Save that, slow-rising o'er the liquid plain, Yon vessels swell imperfect on the sight; And, as they speed the distant port to gain, Like flying clouds obstruct the misty light. Majestic sight! But what if Danube's tide, That rolls from realm to realm with long delay, Here pour'd along, with more resistless pride, Thro' seven broad mouths to break his foaming way? Or what if Thought, by Fancy plum'd, should fly To Oronoko's wide expanded shores? Or Plata's stream, where not the keenest eye From the mid-wave the distant bank explores? How shrink, proud Thames, at this tremendous scene The lesser glories of thy boasted sway! A nameless brook that cheers the village green, Thy sea-broad wave unnotic'd glides away. But hold, my Muse, nor seek the distant clime While yet new wonders court thy gaze at home; Nor, fondly panting for the rude sublime, Neglect the beauteous scenes thro' which we roam. Here from this hill that aids the raptur'd sight, Where woods, and vales, and cultur'd meadows lie, Enough is seen to wake the fond delight, And spread enchantment o'er the poet's eye. This winding road, this grassy margin gay, That here advances, there again recedes, Tufted with broom or goss's sober grey, This neighbouring thicket, and yon distant meads. Yes, let me here from this embowering shade, Whence all these scenes come rushing on my view, Tune my soft shell; and here, enthusiast maid! The playful themes of early youth renew. Nor shalt thou, Thames! as slow thy gentle tide Steals in soft silence to the boundless wave, Refuse the strain of one who soon shall glide By lapse as silent to the whelming grave. Yes—like thy waves that to the Ocean flow, Lost in that vortex to be mark'd no more, Shall haste the stream that wakes this sentient glow, Nor leave one trace on Life's deserted shore. What? not one trace! Shall not, alas! this name, Which e'en in keen Misfortune's darkest hour My jealous care preserv'd from envious Shame, Shall this not 'scape Oblivion's ruthless pow'r? Ah! no. How vain to feed the fond desire E'en this lov'd relic from the wreck to save! In cold neglect shall every hope expire, And Memory's self shall moulder in the grave. [Yes, Nature! yes: to my enthusiast eye] Yes, Nature! yes: to my enthusiast eye, When vernal brightness flushes every charm, Thy vivid rays and breathing tints supply The fond delights that youthful Fancy warm. Thy budding sweets, thy universal green, (Save where the hawthorn blossoms to the view) Thy carol'd strains, and perfum'd gales serene, Thy mid-day blush, and tears of mattin dew, All, all enchant; and in my glowing breast. Rouse from long slumber Joy's ecstatic train, While the gay spirits, now no more opprest, Fly thro' each nerve and glow in every vein: Nor less gay Summer, bounteous in her charms, The grateful heart of Admiration warms. But, ah! when Autumn, sober-suited pow'r! O'er the luxuriant herbage flings her veil, With browner tints to tinge each artless bow'r, When first the foliage flies before the gale;— Then when each object drinks the deeper die, And fresh varieties of sombre hue Sort with the solemn glories of the sky, With new delight thy alter'd charms I view;— Charms that each vain fantastic joy restrain, And lull each tumult of the way ward soul, While Contemplation's heav'n-instructed vein Awakes of Reason's pow'r the soft controul: Ah! then, how sweet, how lasting, and serene Thy Poet's joy to trace the rural scene! Nor shalt thou, Nature, when each softer charm, Each fertile grace, and every radiant glow, And all the smiles that deck thy hallow'd form Are shook by sullen tempests from thy brow; Nor shalt thou, then, while o'er the leafless glade Scarce peers the distant sun, and o'er the ground, Check'ring the glaring snows, the long, long shade Spreads cheerless, while the north-wind yells around; Not, then, O Nature! shall thy frown forlorn To unremitting gloom and sullen care Resign thy votary. Oft the tardy morn My song shall wake: and oft at noon to share Thy transient smile that gilds the mountain brow, And o'er the trackless vales that glare below Sheds its faint radiance, blithe will I repair And snatch the short-liv'd boon; and where the oak His naked branches o'er the frozen brook Snow-crown'd extends, and in the feeble ray Glitters the pendant icicle; ah! there, Gazing with curious rapture, let me stray, Where, branching oft, full many an antic spray Convolving writhes, as burnish'd fold o'er fold Writhes the envenom'd snake, and lifts in air His curving neck across the trav'ller's way. Such, beauteous still, and awful to behold, The forest monarch stands; as o'er the storm (Of innate worth secure) the naked form Of Patriot Virtue in the trying hour Majestic towers, while Faction's raging power Howls thro' the trembling desolated clime!— Unmov'd she stands—deserted, yet sublime, The people's secret love—the hope of future time!

As broods the mangled serpent o'er his wound,— As lurks, in ivy'd nook, the caitiff owl, Nor dares, while beams the sun's broad glare around, Wake the scar'd echoes with her murd'rous howl. So, sullen fiend! to this dark cavern flies The man of crimes—by hopeless pangs opprest.— Fiend! thou art here.—How ghastly glare thy eyes! While thy chill touch congeals my shuddering breast.

How oft (when martial glory urg'd the soul) Our Richards, Henrys, Edwards prov'd thy force: Whose race, resistless, to Ambition's goal Outwing'd thy glowing arrow's fatal course. E'en now, as distant scenes, and visions old, The magic powers of Fancy, pleas'd, renew, Rank urg'd on rank, victorious, I behold The gallant bands their scatter'd foes pursue. Here bold Croisaders, urg'd by holy zeal, Spread swift destruction thro' the impious band: The strings resound; and gasping myriads feel The distant vigour of the archer's hand. See Cour De Lion o'er the slaught'ring field, Like Mars himself, directs the shafts of fate: Whole nations shout: the gall'd battalions yield, And hovering Ruin threats the Pagan state. Full in the van of Conquest's bold career Britannia thunders, and her sons pursue: All Europe throngs tumultuous in their rear, To share their triumphs, and their labours view. 'Twas thus our bowmen, in the days of yore, In Glory's fatal strife unequal'd stood: O'er Asia's fields their conquering banners bore, While the pale Crescent sunk in seas of blood. But where, my Muse, on mad Ambition's wing, Where speeds thy flight? to what disastrous clime? The flattering incense of thy praise to fling On War's sell altar, stain'd with every crime! What is this Glory, nursed in deeds of death? The scourge, at once, and idol of the world! Who breathes—and plagues and famine wait her breath: Who speaks—and round are blasting thunders hurl'd. Ah! would to heaven that Wisdom's awful voice Might 'midst the clamours of her train be heard! That Reason's dictates might direct our choice, And Truth and Virtue be alone rever'd! How might the Toil—the Genius oft employ'd To savage realms and thin the human race, Have made whole desarts smile in useful pride, And deck'd ev'n barren rocks with Culture's grace! How might that wealth which War's inhuman trade Has oft abus'd, to aggravate Distress, Have chac'd the gloom from Misery's friendless shade, And taught Despair the liberal hand to bless. Yes Glory, yes—had it thy triumph been To heal—not wound, to cherish—not destroy: Thro' many a wasted realm how chang'd a scene Had met the sage's meditative eye! Then had we seen, instead of burning towns, Of fields laid waste, of horrid piles of slain, And all that History shudders while she owns, Fair smiling Peace, and Plenty's sylvan reign. Then, as thy chariot roll'd sublime along, No Orphan's curses, nor no Widow's tears Should mix, discordant, with the shouting throng, And pour their anguish in thy wounded ears. Instead of these, to strew thy peaceful way With flowers, and fruits, and leaves of holy palm, The village youth before thy steeds should play, And Love and Music breathe the mingled charm? There, too, should Commerce pour her busy train To hail thee passing;—and each artist band, And all who pant the laurel wreath to gain Of liberal Science, laud thy high command. But chief the Muse, sweet soother of my care! Her grateful voice should lift with fond acclaim; With honest pride thy splendid triumphs share, And swell the chorus of thy guiltless fame? [Enchanting maid! whose voice and air] Enchanting maid! whose voice and air Alike the attentive soul ensnare, And, with commutual charm, supply The perfect types of harmony! In whom enamour'd Fate bestows What eastern poets fabled long, The nightingale and blushing rose (Love's fragrant bloom, and magic song!) In bonds of sweet affection join'd; While beaming from the radiant eye Speaks forth the feeling, polish'd mind That wakes the finer extacy, And shews, with Wisdom's laurel wove, Each bloom of Taste, Refinement, Love! PHILAUTIACCHA; OR THE VOLUPTUARY: A RHAPSODY. How lost to every sense of joy The wretch who courts the lonely sigh! Who flies from Pleasure's cheerful dome To rocks and shades of pensive gloom, And musing through the mould'ring pile— The castle's wreck, or Gothic isle— Converses, with mysterious dread, With troops of “visionary dead,” And counts, in his bewilder'd mind, The various woes of humankind! Who, dreaming fool! condemn'd to bear A portion of each wretch's care, Will pine for every stranger's woe, And weep when others' sorrows flow; If anguish rend a neighbour's soul, Will dash with gall his sprightly bowl, And sniv'ling to his closet fly If Envy nip a brother's joy! Oh! may I never, never be, Thou squeamish dame! accurst with thee, Tormenting Sensibility! But ever shall my vows be paid To thee, thou blest indifferent maid! Who view'st alike, with careless eyes, Another's sorrows, or his joys; Intent to seize, with eager hand, Whatever bliss thy stars command:— Bliss which, to be admitted true, The touch must feel, the sense must view; And which, like vital breath, 'tis known To be enjoy'd must be our own. Thee, damsel, wanton, sleek, and gay! Blithe Bacchus got one festive day, When, reeling, he the vineyard sought, And 'neath the mantling tendrils thought, Defended from the sultry ray, To doze the tippling fumes away. There it was his chance to see The sordid dame Misanthropy: A louring, selfish, sullen wight, Who scowling flies from human sight, Nor ever heav'd the social sigh, Nor knew participated joy. Her he seiz'd, in dalliance rude, And to his will by force subdued; And hence from her unwilling womb Didst thou, blithe motley damsel, come— Who know'st around thy brow to twine With clusters of thy father's vine The myrtle spray of Paphos grove And rosy wreath he wont to love, Till all thy mother's sullen hue, And sordid front retire from view, And thronging votaries hail thy fame, Adorn'd with Pleasure's hallow'd name: But they, the pow'rs who rule on high, And, stooping from their ambient sky, Read at will the secret heart, And view thy mother's sager part. Combining in thy motley frame With all thy father's wanton flame,— As sportive, sensual, loose as he, And selfish, to the full, as she!— To paint in one descriptive name Each adverse parent's partial claim, In sage debate awhile confer, And call thee Philautiaccha! Come, sportive, wanton, brisk, along, With flowing bowl and antic song, And banquets gay, and feasting high, And laughter loud, and thoughtless joy. Come, revel high without controul!— Why should reflection damp the soul?— While, unrestrained, I riot free In all the pomp of luxury, What is't to me that at the door A thousand wretches, starv'd and poor, With dismal moan, and plaintive cry, And shivering limbs, all naked lie? Wherefore should I unhappy be That others are in misery? Do Monarchs, or their tools of state, Their wild ambition e'er abate, Or quit one barren tract of land, Whose subjugation Pride had plann'd, Because the ruthless edge of war, To spread their mighty names afar, Must mow in heaps the base-born crowd, And leave the peasant's low abode, While Desolation stalks around, A prostrate ruin on the ground— While widows, orphans, houseless rove With piteous plaint the heart to move, The palsied hand of Want to spread To passing crowds, in vain, for bread? Will they the haughty scheme forego For fear the general groan of woe Resounding thro' the subject land Should learn to curse the scepter'd hand? No: keep but sheath'd the rebel sword, The wanton night, the wasteful board, Unawed by Conscience, they enjoy, And give new mandates to destroy; And shall not, patron of my song! Their great example sway the throng Who to thy hallow'd fane resort With festive Joy and reeling Sport? Here, higher fill the sprightly bowl, Shall I the plenteous draught controul, Or stint the measure of my bliss, (Ye feeling sniv'lers, tell me this!) That others may the bliss enjoy My more propitious stars supply? No: may I never never be, Thou squeamish dame! accursed with thee, Tormenting Sensibility! When now the noisy banquet tires, Let Beauty kindle fierce desires. Then, while tumultuous joy alarms, I'll languish in some fair one's arms. —Oh! give me, with assiduous art, To triumph o'er the female heart! Lo, Chloe's eye provokes my flame; My heart does Fanny's beauty claim; The rose that tinges Sylvia's cheek, Fair Flavia's ivory polish'd neck, Bright Celia's graceful panting breast, With charming shape gay Phebe blest, All, all alike, my bosom fire, All, all enkindle fierce desire; And all—might I my wish obtain!— Shall ease my heart's delightful pain. Or if by my desires I'm led Some lovely loathing fair to wed, With golden views I'll win her sire To yield her up to my desire; I'll riot in the unwilling joy, And force the bliss she would deny; While some fond favour'd youth shall tear With frenzy his dishevelled hair; Or, in the desperate rage of woe, Dismiss his soul to shades below. What is't to me if she should pine, Her silly heart to grief resign, Waste the long day in sullen sighs, And meet my wish with streaming eyes? The mellow touch of feeble woe A softer languor may bestow; And I alike by turns can hail The flaunting rose, or lily pale! Then let her pine—with grief expire— So I obtain my heart's desire. I am no dull, no constant fool: She'll live at least till I grow cool. When glutted grows the amorous fire (For beauty's brightest charms will tire) I'll leave my couch at early dawn, And follow blithe the echoing horn. See, see the steeds impatient stand, And paw, with restless hoof, the land: They snort, curvet, and loudly neigh, Impatient of the dull delay. We mount. Uncoupled are the hounds. See, they trace the bushy grounds. They snuff the gale. They start the hare: And mingled clamours rend the air. The deep-mouth'd hounds, with eager cry, Pursue the scent, and yelping fly. We shouting follow in the rear, Devoid of ev'ry coward fear; The hedge we jump, the gate we leap, And over ditch and streamlet skip.— Behold, behold, our comrade falls, And loud for our assistance calls; Aloud with anguish he complains Of broken limbs, and raging pains. Yo hoy, my boys! the game pursue; Behold, behold the hare in view! Shall we the glorious sport forego To weep at our companion's woe? Tantwivy, boys! pursue, pursue, Behold, the game is full in view. See, she takes the foaming tide; Pursu'd, she gains the distant side. Our steeds refuse the curbing rein, And in the torrent plunge amain. Now closely cling, the saddle keep, Or else ye sound the troubled deep. And see, the bold adventrous fair Who would our manly pastimes share;— She falls! she falls! aloud she cries, The splashing waves around her rise. Tantwivy, boys! the hare's in view, The well-breath'd beagles close pursue. Ya hoa! my lads! away, away.— The eager sport forbids delay.— Now o'er the fields of ripen'd corn In swift pursuit we're eager borne, The bended ears, where'er we fly, Trampled on earth, our steeds destroy: With curses loud the farmer views, And fretting, with his eye pursues. Why let him fret, and chase, and fume, 'Tis nought to me, as I presume. Ya hoigh! my comrades! how he stands And rears to heav'n his clasping hands!— “Why halloo, farmer! do you pray In open air at middle day?” He feels—he feels the biting jest, And beats with frantic rage his breast. 'Tis true, what thus our hoofs destroy Might some poor famish'd wretch supply; Might give a meal to those who till'd But seldom taste the plenteous field. But why should thoughts like these assail? Pursue—pursue the tainted gale! We do but chace our lawful game: And Royal George would do the same: That best of Kings! whose gracious care The World's four distant corners share; While all an equal cause must own To bless him for the good he'as done!!! See, see, the hounds have seiz'd the hare, And fierce her mangled haunches tear. Now, huntsmen, do not spare the whip: Beat, beat them off! The ready lip Then to the mellow horn apply, And swell the loud triumphant joy, Till woods, and echoing hills reply. I well remember on a day To have heard a squeamish sniv'ler say, “How cruel 'tis, for sport that we Should give these creatures misery! Poor puss! poor harmless puss!” he said, And hung in dole his oafish head. “What joy can any thinking mind From all thy fears and tortures find?” Oh! would to Jove the sniv'lling dunce Were to a hare transform'd at once, That we might chace him now to death! Why have such milksops vital breath? Oh! may I never, never be, Thou squeamish dame! accurst with thee, Tormenting Sensibility! Thus done the chace, new visions rise, Bath'd in the bowl's capacious joys, Of choral mirth, and reeling song, And jokes that Laughter's reign prolong, Till Slumber, wrapt in antic fumes, At length her wonted reign assumes. Thus let me walk gay Pleasure's rounds, With wine, with women, horses, hounds, And whate'er else can transport give; For only while we're gay we live. Let tender Pity sway the woman's mind While I the sweets of sensual Rapture find! [O giant fiend! whose haggard eye] O giant fiend! whose haggard eye, Blasting each hope of future joy, In wildering terror restless roves; Intent, with savage pride, to seize Whate'er the frantic purpose moves, Whate'er may Reason's current freeze, And Resolution's guardian pow'r Pervert in Sorrow's languid hour (While keen Remorse aloof attends) To fell Destruction's baneful ends! O fell Despair! should e'er my soul Dejected feel thy dark controul, May then, as I eccentric stray, In lonely grief retir'd to mourn, No yawning chasm cross my way, No rapid torrents winding bourn, No cliff that o'er the raging main Projecting lours, and turns his brain, Who, forward bent, with 'ventrous gaze The foaming surge beneath surveys. Ah! when the melancholy pang assails, And pale Despondence wrings the feeling heart, Too oft, dread fiend! thy sullen power prevails, And barbs too oft the self-destroying dart. There are who yielding to affliction's smart, Cherish each sullen fiend of Fancy's train, To every scene the darkest hues impart, And conjure phantoms in the working brain;— Who, all alive in every throbbing vein To wild Imagination's lawless power, The gloomy perturbation scarce restrain When lonely Silence rules the darkling hour. To such,—if chance along the level meads (While o'er its breast the weeping oziers play) Whispering soft murmurs to the waving reeds, The purling riv'lets slow meanders stray;— E'en scenes like these—(what time the lunar ray Spangles the dimpling wave, and tolling slow, The solemn knell, as holy legends say, Scares from the death-bed scene the hovering fiend away) —E'en scenes like these may feed the desperate woe Till fearful fancies rise; and dark Dismay The seat of guiding Reason overthrow: Prompting the deed that Nature shrinks to hear, And meek Compassion waters with a tear. Ah! ne'er may such, while throbs the wildering brain, With devious step this tottering brink attain. [Let raging tyrants, with malignant pride] Let raging tyrants, with malignant pride, Display their talents in the public scene, In glittering arms o'er groaning myriads ride, And drench with purple guilt the peaceful green. Let them, still jealous of imagin'd rights, Sound the dire clarion, spread the clouds of war, To rouse their frantic slaves, and quench the lights Of Reason's sun, and Freedom's polar star. Let senseless crowds, assembled at their nod, Smit with strange hate of Liberty! arise; To humbled Pride restore Oppression's rod, And lift the fallen Idol to the skies. Let them, enamour'd of the galling yoke, Rush on to death; and orphans, widows leave The chains they purchas'd with their blood to brook; To toil rewardless, and unpitied grieve. Let them (for, why, when monarchs give command, Should Sense or Virtue check the vassal's zeal?) Against their Guardians lift the furious hand, And in their Champions' bosoms plunge the steel. We—we, my friend, while such mad passions reign, Such servile folly rules the bustling crew, Will fly, indignant, from the thankless train, And leave the ingrates their ruin to pursue. Oh! better far, within some cloister's gloom, Some forests shade, or cavern's lone retreat, To waste in sullen sighs our youthful bloom, And each sad sun with pining sorrow greet; Better, forswearing Nature's genuine right, Withdrawn for ever from her social law, To live entomb'd, and bid eternal Night Round the lone head her sullen curtain draw; Better than mingling in such scenes as these, To aid the fiend Destruction's raging hand, See her fell gripe each Public Virtue seize, And scourge fair Freedom from each groaning Land! Ah! better far, forgetting and forgot, Sequester'd, to the peaceful grave to glide, From Fortune's wheel withdraw our anxious lot, And crimes we can't prevent, at least avoid. Then, Belmour, come! together let us stray, And seek some hermit's deep embower'd retreat; Tune for each other's ear the mournful lay, And all the anguish of our souls repeat. Thy tender woes from out her secret bower, To sweet response shall wooe the bird of eve: But mine, more loud, shall, at the midnight hour, Wake the shrill echoes; teach the rocks to grieve; The woods, the vales, the mountains to reply, And Nature's self to join the deep-drawn sight For, oh! I mourn for worlds!—for myriads mourn Still doom'd in bonds and wretchedness to sigh!— Against themselves the sharpen'd steel who turn, And forge the fetters which they should destroy. And shalt thou, Freedom (oh! my boding soul!) In the stern grasp of Tyranny expire? While conquering Despots rage without control, And Superstition round thy funeral pyre Exulting smiles, and sees, with savage pride, Each hope of human happiness destroy'd! [Sepulchre of a parent dear!] Sepulchre of a parent dear! Oft conscious of my lone complaint, Oh! treasure still the holy tear:— Chaste tribute to a martyr'd saint! Ah! what can hopeless anguish more— On earth—in heav'n without a friend— Than thus her guiltless crime deplore, And sighs and tears repentant blend? Oh faithless Love!—oh constant woe! Mysterious suffering ne'er to cease! And must the tears that ceaseless flow Ne'er lull the mangl'd soul to peace? Then come again, sad soother, Death! Again I seek thy gloomy cave; Resign the painful—fruitless breath Which heav'n for lingering sufferance gave! Sepulchre of a parent dear! Oft conscious of my lone complaint, Oh! treasure still the holy tear:— Chaste tribute to a martyr'd saint! [Ah! witness thou, o'er whose untimely bier] Ah! witness thou, o'er whose untimely bier, Cropp'd in thy smiling beauty's gayest bloom, My Lyre, responsive to the trickling tear, Wak'd the lorn echoes; thou whose silent tomb My early muse with dews and flow'rets deck'd: Wild flowers, indeed, pluck'd from the lowly glade: Yet such might serve to shew thy kindred shade A pure remembrance, and a fond respect— Ah! witness thou to whom with early pride I lisp'd in numbers, and I lisp'd of love; For whom so oft my infant bosom sigh'd, And breath'd its fondness to the list'ning grove— How thrill'd my bosom when thy accent kind Spoke gentle confidence? how stood the tear Big trembling in my eye, if chance the fear Of favour'd rivals stung my anxious mind? Nor you, ye sages, with sarcastic smile The infant dawn of sympathy deride!— The honest throb of bosoms free from guile, Unsway'd by interest,—unseduc'd by pride! 'Tis hence, perhaps,—from this etherial glow, (Where grosser passion claims no sordid part) That all the fine, extatic feelings flow, That lift the fancy, and expand the heart! Hence all the quick perceptions; hence the nerve That feels alike for all the sentient sphere; For every joy a transport can reserve, For every sorrow shed the pitying tear. Yes, hence the Poet's Soul its genuine fire May catch;—each glowing charm, each polish'd art: And ev'n divine Philanthropy aspire To soothe the pangs of every throbbing heart. This Shakespeare's rapid genius might bestow, Stodart's warm tint, and Howard's generous glow. [And I who frequent, from my infant years] And I who frequent, from my infant years, Led on by curious Fancy's daring hand, With “harebreadth scapes and dangers imminent,” Have toy'd familiar—Who, in pensive mood, Oft by the rushing torrent's crumbling bourn High tottering, or deep eddie overhung By writhing oak, or willow's weeping spray,— Fit couch! fit canopy for brooding thought At Evening's solemn hour!—on rocking wall, Fragment of antique abbey, hall, or wreck Of ivy vested Castle,—or, sublime, On the cloud propping cliff's tremendous brow, Have woo'd the awful dread that thrills the soul, And wakes Imagination's wildest dream, Till the daz'd sight turns fearful:—Even I (Deserting from my friends and guide to trace The long neglected avenue, and mount The still more shatter'd steps, which even the foot Of vent'rous Curiosity resigns To bats and owls, who soar on buoyant wing To their high cradled young) though from my youth, Familiar with such scenes, shrink back appall'd, As, near the summit, o'er loose rugged stones I gain the narrow undefended way, Where, as I stride, perchance, the smallest slip, Or giddy wandering of the timid brain, Might headlong plunge me many a fathom down, A breathless, mangled spectacle, no more In worth and dignity than the poor rooks Whose fate (thrown timeless from the lofty nest) Below I had deplored. Ah! wherefore, say, Does Curiosity thus urge the step Such scenes of trembling horror to explore?— Why—but that hence the peace-illumin'd scene, Where calm Security reclines, may smile With softer pleasures, and enjoy the charm Of dear vicissitude?—Why—but that Heaven, Intent to variegate, with bounteous care, The copious sources of mysterious joy, For minds of a peculiar stamp reserves Some daring pleasures—some peculiar zests Of awe and high sublimity, that must, Ere with their genuine glow they throb the breast, Be snatch'd from giant Danger's lowering brow? ODE to the CLIFFS, at SANDGATE. STROPHE I. Oh! how Remembrance feasts with visual joy, As, by Imagination's friendly aid, Again upon the rocking precipice She stands sublime! Or o'er the rude-projecting strata leans, To scan, with timorous eye, the ragged steep, And hear the murmuring of the ebbing surge That moans along the beach! O! how does Fancy shrink, as, once again, With vent'rous step, on the extended point Of yonder shatter'd rock, that forward leans, And seems to tremble in the thinner air, Again she treads—all isolate, And scarce connected to the living world; And there, in awful meditation wrapp'd, Beholds above, below, and all around, One boundless ocean of ethereal dew,— Save where the unstable prominence to the cliff Imperfect joins: An isthmus rude, Which the first shattering tempest rends away, Enrag'd,—and hurls In dread convulsion to the raging flood That foams, and roars beneath. ANTISTROPHE I. Here, as I hover o'er the green abyss, Whose mountain billows scarce below appear To ape the little ripples that adorn The babbling stream, With what bold freedom the excursive eye Plays o'er the glassy surface, and admires The dancing sun-beams, and the porpoise huge That, rolling, sports below! Ye monsters of the flood! however rude, To man's imperfect sense, your savage forms! Howe'er to us your elemental waves Seem to shut out the finer extasies That the warm sun should meliorate, And balmy gales fan into rapturous being,— Ye have too your sports, your joys peculiar, Your loves, your pastimes, in the gelid wave, That check the Tyrant's impious sophistry, And prove the World he fondly deems his own Was made for all: Appropriate boons To every tenant of the sentient sphere To yield,—and make To other, each, within his bounded range, Impart alternate bliss! EPODE I. O! how serene! With what a mild effulgence o'er the deep Bends the clear Heav'n! While, borne by gentle breezes from the coast, Alauda floats, and warbles as she floats On russet wing secure: Rock'd by the buoyant billows, far beneath, The flocking sea-fowl spread the oily wing, Scarce from this height discernable; And friendly zephyrs, Slow, from yon distant point yet scarcely seen, Waft the white sail, that homeward proudly swells To kiss the wish'd-for shore. Ah! may no bleak disaster sudden rise To blast the seaman's hopes, To steep in hopeless tears the virgin's eye, Who now, expectant, from the stony beach Views the slow bark, prophetic of its freight, And William's faithful love. Yet see!—the anxious eye, Straining with eager rapture, dim descries At yonder point, Where, stooping to the wave, the Horizon faints, And spreads the margin of her mantle grey To close the misty prospect, The darkening cloud Spread its long streak upon the bounded wave, That, lull'd, oblivious, by the opiate weight, Gleams like a polish'd mirror. Auspicious gales the gloomy sign avert!— Is it, ye fiends of storm, Some gloomy tempest from the Ocean caves Rising, sublime, to cleave the rocking earth, The smiling image of the world deform, And mix the warring elements? Or is it: say: Some dark aerial vapour, close condens'd, To lock the imprison'd thunder for awhile, That soon, dread rattling up the azure vault, Shall tear the beauteous concave as it flies, The tower and forest monarch prostrate lay, Whelm the wreck'd vessel in the treacherous wave, Plunge the worn crew in endless night, And blast each promis'd joy? STROPHE II. Ah, no! no mists belch'd forth from Ocean caves, Brooding the rocking Earthquake, swell to view: Nor dense aerial vapour's sable folds Shroud the dread storm, That soon with loud-destroying rage shall burst, Bid the blue concave flame with sudden wrath, And with mad vengeance rend the forest oak And whelm the exulting bark! But fair to view, as now the sharpen'd ken Pierces the hovering mists, distinct appear Thy cliffs and swelling shores, luxuriant France! Whose luscious fruitage for the spoiling hand Of bold rapacious Tyranny Had redden'd in the partial sun too long: That partial Sun who, on thy fertile hills Still lingering, with prolific ray benign, Mourn'd to behold an injur'd, trampled race, Groan in the field, and labour at the press, While, with fell gripe, A ruffian crew, With gaudy titles deck'd, the goblet seiz'd; Drain'd off the luscious draught, and left for them The bitter dregs alone. ANTISTROPHE II. And Oh! that now no Woes of other hue O'er the devoted country threat'ning frown'd, And the well-meaning many left a prey To Demagogues, Who o'er the wrecks of public Virtue rise, And whet the dagger for compatriot strife, That on the common spoilers of the earth Should spend its nobler rage;— Should scourge the tyrants who with impious aim Seek in the desolated fields of France, While there again the fallen fane they rear Of Kingly fraud, new yokes and chains to forge To bow the necks (well meriting!) Of tame obsequious vassals, who at home Lavish their treasures to promote the fame Of these ungrateful pageants; false, and base! —O France! O England! rouse ye ere ye fall! Let not thy upstart tyrants, Gallia! balk Thy great designs: Nor Britain thou Be lull'd in fatal lethargy, supine, And wake—(too late!) To curse the galling yoke thy folly bought, And clank thy chains in vain. EPODE II. O! for an arm Like Jove's tremendous in Tytanian war To reach these crimes! To vindicate fair Freedom's genuine rights, And of their two-fold Tyrants rid Mankind: This sanguinary crew, That with mad havock grasp at transient power, And in wrong'd Liberty's polluted seat Establish factious Anarchy; And these Oppressors— These proud destroyers of the abject World,— That groans and toils, that they may feast, and slay,— That with blind frenzy slights Each kindred duty of the social heart To swell their fatal power, To lift the puppet Idols to the skies, With mimic lightnings arm their frantic hands, With fulsome flattery fan their crimes, and feed Their pestilential pride! O! strike them, gracious Heav'n! With thy avenging thunders check their crimes! Let them, transfix'd, With adamantine chains and fetters bound, On the bleak summit of yon frowning rocks Bewail their guilty fury! Let them, so long As the pent Ocean chafes the rocky bourns Of these storm-sever'd realms, their guilt bewail; Their fell, destroying fury Of mad Ambition, and Anarchic rage! Let them, avenging powers! As glides the passing bark, oft shriek aloud, And bid the shuddering mariners attend; And to his native region each convey The important admonition— “O friends! no more, “Deaf to the call of Patriot Virtue, seek “A bloody harvest from your Country's woes! “O royal plunderers of the world! no more “Plunge your deluded realms in savage war “To check fair Freedom's course; but see in us “The living monuments of sacred wrath; “And yield to Man his ravish'd rights; —“To Heav'n its worship'd sway!” [O! how sweet, at the hour when, deep-blushing, appears] O! how sweet, at the hour when, deep-blushing, appears The sun's swelling orb at the brink of the sky, And Eve, pensive Eve, bathes the vale with her tears, And Zephyr, sad Zephyr, expires in a sigh— O! how sweet at this hour, when half-wearied with toil, And each kind emotion awak'd in the breast That Heav'n's varied bounties and Nature's gay smile Ere stamp'd on the mind that by Fancy is blest— O! how sweet, at this hour, on the brow of some hill, By side the clear brook, or embower'd in the vale, Directed, perhaps, by the clack of the mill, Or Milkmaid's blithe carol, who sings o'er her pail, To approach the lone hamlet, our labours to close, And share the tir'd peasant's contented repose! O! how sweet, when each warbler that trill'd from the spray, Or to Heav'n's azure concave with rapture aspir'd (The tir'd pinion relax'd, hush'd in silence the lay) To the grove's covert shade with his mate has retir'd: How sweet, as around every cottage they play, (As you wind thro' the lane or the meadow) to hear The rude ruddy infants attune the wild lay!— What chorus so sweet to Humanity's ear? —Sport on, thoughtless babes! ah, yet sport and he gay, Enjoy the short rapture, and hail the bright glow! Nor reflect ('twere in vain) on the heels of the day, Tread Night and her shadows—tread Manhood and Woe! Ah! too near is the time that your sorrow assures— When Toil and Affliction alone shall be yours! But see from the furrow, the glebe, and the plough, The peasants return with the toil-sullied brow: To their rest they return, to their scanty repast: For the hour of refreshment relieves them at last. As hither with toil-wearied steps they repair, Hark what lisps and what shouts their loud welcome declare: While, their sports broken off, how the innocents fly, And clasp each hard hand with a transport of joy; Or hang by the coat, as around them they throng, And lend their small efforts to drag them along. Each grief these endearments from memory blot, And the cares of the day, and its toils are forgot; Till again to their dames, o'er their scantling of ale, As they eat their brown bread, they supply the short tale: Then to bed they retire, their adventures to close, To taste (be they sweet!) the short boons of repose: While the wealthy and proud in mad riot and joy The fruits of their labour and hardships destroy. Now silence succeeds to the bustle of day, And the Moon's silver orb to the Sun's ruddy beam; Awhile thro' the dews let me pensively stray, And indulge soothing Fancy awhile in her dream. While the Nightingale trills, your sweet minstrel divine! Let me pierce, O ye Fays! your sequester'd retreat; With your Shakespeare, your Colins, your Fletcher recline; Your revels enjoy, and your fables repeat. Ah, why are ye fled, gentle Fays! from the Muse, Whose songs ye adorn'd, and whose lessons improv'd? Are ye scar'd that stern critics their sanction refuse?— Dull spectres of Night by malignity mov'd! Ah, scorn their dark malice; renew the wild strain; And give us our Fletchers and Shakespeares again. Such—such are my joys, in lone hamlet retir'd, When the toil of the day, and its pleasures are o'er.— Or, perhaps, with the throng by rude Nature inspir'd I share the blithe cup, and their feelings explore. Ah! little ye know, who, envelop'd by pride, Alone the dull pastimes of Grandeur behold, What life, and what fancy, and humour reside In these circles of Mirth by no Fashion control'd. How oft have I smil'd ('twas the smile of the heart, Not the simper of Form, by Hypocrisy taught; The mask of dull Custom, the effort of Art To escape, but in vain, from the torture of Thought.) How oft have I smil'd, their shrewd maxims to hear, And see the strong traits of wild Nature appear! Let the proud and the weak, then, the dull and the great, Who loll in their coaches in indolent state, Who, idle at home, but for idleness stray, And abroad only prize what's at home every day— Let to these the proud Inn yield its splendour and down, And the Country repeat the dull pleasures of Town. Let me, whom each pleasure eccentric can move, Who would travel to know, and would live to improve, When at eve my tir'd limbs relaxation require, To some snug little thatch, in some hamlet, retire; Where, the cravings of Nature content to supply, I may hear, or may join in the hind's rustic joy— May Man in his varied conditions compare, And learn the hard lot which too many must bear; That thus, as with all I alternately blend, The mind may expand, and the heart may amend; Till, embracing Mankind in one girdle of Love, In Nature's kind lesson I daily improve, And (no haughty distinctions to fetter my soul) As the brother of all, learn to feel for the whole.

[Me, from my infant years, the inspiring Muse] Me, from my infant years, the inspiring Muse (Though by the mind's as yet unpractis'd ear Not heard distinctly) oft would sweetly wooe, To meditate o'er Nature's varied charms, And from the mute instructors of the grove, The rugged heath, or mead, or cultur'd bower Where richest Flora blooms, or where more wild She flings her native sweets with artless hand, O'er brake or hedgerow, to imbibe the lore That wakes each keen emotion's trembling glow, And feeds the fervour of the Poet's soul. Even then to wander pensive and alone, “Beneath the precipice o'erhung with pine,” Oft unperceiv'd I left the cheerful throng, And stole, in lonely meditation wrapt, Slow by the woodland side, at the still hour Of pensive Evening. Or when mid-day Sol O'er the blue concave shot his garish beams, Plung'd in the thickest labyrinths, dark, and wild, I shun'd the unwelcome fervour. There full oft Upon the mossy relic have I set Of some once tow'ring oak, whose writhing limbs And giant trunk the woodman's sounding axe Had fell'd in days of yore, and left behind A hoary monument—of power to wake The deep drawn sigh that mourns the transient date Of Sublunary Greatness, and the fall Of high aspiring Virtue, that would tow'r And spread its verdant honours o'er the realm That gave it birth;—or to the listless arm Of mournful Meditation to afford A meet support, what time, as Fancy prompts, Musing intent, the pensive head reclines;— There seated oft, with forms etherial-plum'd I held ideal converse, or invok'd The Genii of the woods, or call'd to mind The winning tales of fairies, and of elves, And wandering ghosts, and hermits, and the train (Magii, or incubus, or fiend) that throng The Gothic legend, which the oral Muse (Vers'd in traditions old) had summon'd oft, With mutter'd spell uncouth, to thrill the soul, And with strange raptures wing the winter's night. Or if, by chance, low murmuring on my ear, Rush'd the lorn cadence of some fretted stream, Winding, and babbling, to the mossy shore, Even then I stole, the arching boughs beneath, And traced, with silent awe, its mazy course; Or, stretch'd at length, the visionary power Of Fancy from her airy cell sublime Woo'd to my infant side; in fabling thought Heard to the plaining rill the minstrels voice Accord the mournful tale; or o'er the brook My head propending shed the soothing tear, Prophetic of the hovering Woes prepar'd To blast my rip'ning years, to nip each joy, Each smiling promise of my vernal youth, And bring the untimely seer:—if tears so sweet, Of such serene enchantment! of the woes That gloom'd my rip'ning years, that envious nipp'd Each smiling promise of my vernal youth, And brought the seer untimely might be deem'd Fit harbingers; or Superstition's self Could turn warm Nature's fine-vibrating throb To dreams of antic Mysticism, and form From soft sensations of the thrilling heart, A gloomy train to throng the peopled sky. O, wondrous Nature! O, mysterious law And winning charm of rapturous Melancholy! That, causeless, thus, can o'er the infant eye Spread the dim soothing veil of semblant woe; From sombrous glooms, and sounds of sullen awe, Can call extatic Rapture, and in tears Bathe sweeter joys than Laughter ever knew! [O, Friendship! balm of Sorrow's wound!] O, Friendship! balm of Sorrow's wound! Kind star that, thro' affliction's night Shed'st the soft ray of Hope around, To guide—to cheer the wanderer's sight! O, radiance meek! that round the pole Which props man's little world of joys, While other planets distant roll, A pure and constant beam supplies!— O ne'er—tho' my eccentric feet Thro' wilds and pathless desarts stray— May me those envious tempests meet, That blot from Heaven thy cheering ray! Still, tho' the thorns of anguish rend, Perplex'd in many a devious maze, Tho' Danger's frown her terrors lend, And in my rear her lightnings blaze; Let but thy mild and settled light (Hear, power serene! thy suppliant's pray'r) Break thro' the general gloom of night, And I will smile, and mock despair. [But, oh! that, Hervey! to thy classic ear] But, oh! that, Hervey! to thy classic ear Some friendly chance these artless lines might bear! That she, the Muse (each sordid care aloof) Who weaves, with feeling hand, the airy woof, From the wrought web a magic clue might lend, Once more to guide thee to thy sorrowing friend, Who loves thy merits, and in memory bears Thy mirth instructive, and thy friendly cares, And with this burthen saddens oft the strain, That hearts for friendship form'd, are form'd in vain. For ah, what pity, since too well 'tis known How thin the flowers of genuine bliss are strown, In this low vale of sorrows and of cares, How small the harvest, and how throng'd the tares; Along Life's road, how many a bramble grows, How many a nettle, for one fragrant rose,— What pity 'tis that Friendship's peerless bloom, (The grain's best virtues, and the flower's perfume— Pleasure and food of every virtuous mind!) Should e'er be left with heedless haste behind, Its fragrance breathe to desert gales away, Smile unadmir'd, and unenjoy'd decay! Come, Hervey, come! nor let me more complain, That hearts for friendship form'd, are form'd in vain. THE EPIC POEM GENIUS OF BRITAIN!—Not that power who strung A Hampden's arm, and urg'd his patriot tongue— Not she that warm'd a Sydney's, Russel's soul, Corruption's tyrant progress to control— Ere yet pretended Patriots, bought and sold, Made public barter of their Votes, for Gold;— Ere Freedom's Representatives, by name, Lauded Despotic Power, unaw'd by shame; In public Senates (fired with frantic rage, Which not the tears of Friendship could assuage) Blacken'd each Name that, true to Freedom's cause, Dar'd plead for Nature's violated Laws;— Ere yet, grown grey in Party's sordid train, (Where who like them the clamorous throat to strain?) Wild, driv'ling Dotards (fired with sacred hate Of all who held what they upheld of late,) Damn'd all the Honours which a glossing Tongue, Practis'd in fraud, and with persuasion hung, Still with the rotten Heart at prudent strife, Had purchas'd with the Lie of a whole life; Renounc'd all Principle, and bared the Heart So long conceal'd from view with painful Art; Threw off the Mask, so long with credit worn, And chang'd Respect for Pity, and for Scorn; To Bathos dived for culinary wit, Made e'en the Stews and Billingsgate submit With sheer scurrility, and blushing own Their claim to mount the Shrew's contested Throne; Thence soaring high, or thinking that they soar'd, The realms of “Beauteous and Sublime” explor'd, Pluck'd down the Stars, and thought those Stars too poor (Moon-struck themselves!) to deck a Royal Whore, Because she chanc'd the Gallic Throne to share, To which (to Dorset thanks!) she brought an Heir. —But why with plurals thus Mankind disgrace? When even these Times produce but one so base. GENIUS of BRITAIN! prompt my Epic theme— Not thou who, nurs'd by Heliconia's stream, Taught ONE ILLUSTRIOUS BRITISH PRINCE to feel A noble love for Learning's sacred weal,— To Sage and Bard that patronage supply Which pimps and fiddlers now alone enjoy,— And, having freed the Land from foreign Foes, Rous'd him to purge it from the darker woes Of savage Ignorance, and Science rear, At once by his Example, and his Care— Not thou who urg'd the Godlike ALFRED's soul, (Virtue his Race, Immortal Fame his Goal!) With reverend Sages to devote his prime,— Ere Caterers, Boxers, Swindlers, curs'd the Clime— Ere yet the Turf alone had charms—Ere yet Rooking was Science, Jockeying was Wit— For Studs ere splendid Palaces arose,— Where Steeds and Grooms, in idle ranks, repose, Consuming more than Gallia's haughty Lord, Her fourteenth Louis, spent to deck that board Where Taste and Science found a sure retreat, And all the Wits of Europe had a Seat!— —Not thou who taught mellifluous Pope to sing, Plum'd Shakespeare's, Milton's, Dryden's daring wing, Ere whining Prat, the pink of Common Place, Pour'd forth long nothings with so soft a grace, Made Sentiment so languishingly creep To the charm'd Heart, as charm'd it quite to Sleep; Made Sympathy thro' two long Cantoes shine, Without assistance from one feeling line, And fair Humanity—so soft—so sweet— Drawl thro' dull pages to the hundredth sheet; Drew meek Morality with such a Grace, With such a simpering, lack-a-daisey Face, Such water-gruel Sweetness, one would swear She “suckled Fools, and chronicled small beer.” —Ere yet quaint Fopperies from the Italian School Threw in forc'd Extasies each Rhyming Fool; Bit, like the Gad Fly, Widows, Wives, and Maids, With frantic bleat to scare the tuneful Shades, Where self-thought Poets, deeper bit than they, To their wild bleat return'd as wild a bray!— Ere DE LA CRUSCA, darling of the WORLD! The random Gaze of Moon-struck-madness hurl'd Thro' the wild “Wilderness of blooming Suns,” And Scenes which Common Sense indignant shuns; Where Popularity, (debauch'd, and led By that old Bawd, hight Puffing, to his Bed,) Brought forth a Swarm of misshaped Monsters, more Than ever spawn'd on Nilus' antic Shore;— Monsters, to nurture which, in happy Hour, Dame COWLEY waken'd in the Muses Bow'r— That Bow'r in which, strew'd by her Angel Hand With Poppies cull'd in Morpheus happy Land— Morpheus! inspiring God of modern Themes! The Patron blest of Poesy and Dreams!— That Bow'r, in which the balmy-soothing Pow'r With partial fondness, oft, at Evening Hour, (“Attention pillowing her reclining Head”) The sweetest Slumbers o'er her Senses spread; While crowded Theatres, by Fate's decree, First clapp'd, then yawn'd, then snor'd as loud as she. GENIUS of BRITAIN!—by what Title grac'd— Fashion or Folly, Vanity or Taste— Thou, whose high Laws, rever'd by Courtly Dames! Cecil's hereditary Wisdom frames.— Important Guardian of a Royal Court! Imperial Grandeur's wisest, best support! Whose awful Nod prescribes the Mantua's grace, And dooms, without appeal, in Gloves and Lace, When, Wand in Hand, on Birth-Days, he presides, And with the BEST OF KINGS the sway divides!— —That BEST OF KINGS, from whom what blessings flow! Who for his People keeps a Raree-Show Of Pictures fine, a Month each Year, or more: But makes them drop their Shillings at the Door!— That BEST OF KINGS, who gives his Royal Name To every Work of Charity, or Fame; But, liberal as he is, with Prudence blest, Keeps the Subscription Guinea in his Chest.— That BEST OF KINGS, who, Umpire of the Arts! To West's coarse outline his first Smile imparts:— West, from whose hand each Male Complexion shines Like half-wrought Copper from our Cornish Mines; While, smooth as wax, each female Cheek is spread, And every Lip, with the same lifeless red!— West, whose long Groups, in order'd Rows display'd, (As ranks of Soldiers strut on the parade,) At Knightly Installations, make us stare, And ask What Corporal drill'd the noble Fair!— West, who, not only taught to husband Time, Maintains the loss of Space an equal Crime, So fills—despite of ease and simple grace— So fills each Scrap of Canvas with a Face, Which all, lest quarrels rise for shape and air, The self-same attitude and features share— West, who, to Scripture rules devoutly true, Thinks Eye for Eye, and Tooth for Tooth, are due, And painting Pharoah, and his warlike host O'erthrown by Moses, and in Soap Suds lost, With vengeful Brush, for Justice, arms his Hands, And murders Moses, as the Law commands.— That West, who, lest the first sad Curse be vain, Damns our fall'n Parents, o'er and o'er again; Then, fired with Zeal, instructs his glorious SON (By whom one Day the Sire shall be outdone) To force grim Satan from the depths of Hell, 'Midst grinning Forms of Ridicule to dwell, Where laughing Scorn shall more afflict his Pride Than all the Flames for torturing Ages tried. GENIUS of BRITAIN!—That same Nymph I mean Who teaches Tambour to our GRACIOUS QUEEN; Whence from her Needle (wond'rous Art!) arise Long Pomps of Silken Trees, and Worsted Skies; Quadrupeds, non-descript, are forc'd to Fame, Plants with new forms, and Flowers without a name: Or, soaring higher, to the Human form, Her steel-eyed Pencil, (exquisitely warm!) Calls faces forth—(if those who late have seen Laurence's Portrait of that awful Mien For such a Fact can take a Poet's word!) Still more unmeaning than her Royal Lord! —Prudent Amusement for a married Dame Whose Numerous Babes her frugal Fondness claim! Expensive Books might shrink her little Store, Concerts and Treats make e'en the Wealthy poor: But she at home who o'er her Needle dreams, Or patches Fragments up with frugal Seams, Or works old Sattin Coats with Colours fine, O'er no Upholsterer's hideous Bill shall pine; Yet sees, blest Harvest of her Royal Cares! Quilts for her Beds, and Covers for her Chairs. GENIUS of BRITAIN! who, with like control, Sway GEORGE's, CHARLOTTE's, WEST's, and WARREN's Soul!— Make MERRY's ravings, COLEMAN's stolen trash, His Tragi-Comic-Pantomimic hash, Pass for true Wit! assist my EPIC LAY: For hard the Task my vent'rous Lines essay. TYPES and the BRUSH I sing, whose friendly aid Calls buried Genius forth from Learning's shade— That shade deserted now by every wight, Save only those who feed on what they write,— Camelion like, in Attic dome, on high, On Couplets feast, and commune with the Sky!— That Shade (if Books may justify the Creed?) When Bishops preach'd and mighty Lords could read, Which even Statesmen deign'd with Smiles to view; To Rectors dear, and reverend Prebends too, Ere yet (for then no sordid Avarice reign'd) Mitres they found more slowly were obtain'd By gaining Crowns in Wisdom's laurel'd List Than losing Crowns with gracious Queen's at Whist!— That Shade where SHAKESPEARE's memory might expire, And MILTON string unheard his Epic Lyre, Did not prim Editors, with timely aid, Rear the long varnish'd Vista's quaint parade, With gilding gay, with flaunting Picture grac'd, To lure the coxcomb eye of modern TASTE— That Shade which now (as FASHION bids) shall shine Throng'd like Vauxhall—as courtly, and as fine! Near that blest Spot of ancient Classic Fame— Fancy's lov'd Region—Grud Street is its name With Mortal Men—how call'd by Gods on high, Small is the import, friend, to you or I— Where oft the Muse (while Muses were esteem'd) In days of yore, with bold inventions teem'd; With Giants, Spectres, and Magicians dire, Monsters and Dragons belching Streams of Fire, Which arm'd Heroes brav'd to Combat, drunk With sacred Love of Piety and Punk!— —Near this fam'd Spot, where Poems once were made, And Founders yet assist the Poet's Trade, For leaden Satires leaden Types supply, And give Ideal Nonsense to the Eye— Near this fam'd spot—nor far (for since, by Fits, Wits will be Madmen, Madmen may be Wits, Our prudent Ancestors, right wisely plann'd Their dwellings in one Neighbourhood should stand, That due assistance might at times be shar'd, And Brothers held in Brotherly regard)— Nor far remov'd from that same noble Pile, A needful Structure in Britannia's Isle! Which, till some Royal head its shelter claim, Of Bedlam bears the low, plebeian Name, There stands a Dome, o'er whole trim Portals shine (Type of JOVE's guardian Care and Love divine!) Lion and Unicorn, by Sculptor bold Carv'd in Olympian Oak, and gay with Gold. A Dome it is each Bard with rapture views Who in spruce Garb would deck his lofty Muse, Thro' sheets of Snow would each dark passage spread, And aid his weight of Brains with weight of Lead. There thro' the livelong Day, o'er many a Forge, Doom'd leaden Bolts of Vengeance to disgorge, The Literary Cyclops toil and sweat O'er the dread Thunders of the Alphabet; Which dealt, with well aim'd Vengeance, o'er the World, Tyrants have bow'd, and mighty Statesmen hurl'd From Power's misgotten, or polluted Seat, Villains have aw'd, and made proud Vice retreat!— Thunders which, pointed by a Monarch's hand, Have spread Confusion thro' a peaceful Land; With short-liv'd Awe have struck the Free-born Soul, Compell'd the use of Reason to control, Compell'd to deem as wicked Traitors, those Not who concert the Treason, but expose— For now 'tis night: no more the Cyclops sweat O'er the dread thunders of the alphabet, Whose dubious terrors can alike control By turns the Tyrant's and the Patriot's soul— Here, tier o'er tier, in many an order'd Row, To please the Goddess, finish'd Letters glow; Not burnish'd Silver beams a brighter Ray; Not prim Sir Fopling more exactly gay Glides thro' the Ball-room, fearful lest the Air Derange a Frill, or disconcert a Hair. —There unwrought Metal lay, heap'd pile on pile; There drossy Refuse of the daily Toil; There, splash'd by careless hands from out the Moulds, Thick spangling Drops the pensive GOD beholds, Decking with useless Pomp, each Screen, each Wall, Furnace, and Chimney, thro' the spacious Hall. “Oh! woeful sight!” the sordid Spectre said, “Oh! impious waste of dear-beloved Lead!— “Lead which, by Alphabeta touch'd, shall own “Him the true Master of the Chymic stone— “Lead which well-wrought, and properly bestow'd, “Might print a Dying Speech or Birth-Day Ode; “GRANT's Lashes publish, and for justice call; “Or shew why ROSE was never lash'd at all.— “Lead from whose womb in order'd ranks shall rise “Those letters doom'd to charm all human eyes, “At sight of which the Dunce's Breast might glow, “Struck with strange Passion for the CRISS CROSS-ROW!— —“Letters, so neat! so trim! so smooth! so fair! “Be they round O o, straight I i, or V v so square, “Or crooked S s, or that s that swells “High o'er the Line, like straighter k k, and l l,— “That lofty s, which Bell, with cruel spite, “Would damn to dark Oblivion's endless Night, “But which, by Alphabeta's loyal Care, “Still o'er the Ranks the lofty Crest shall bear, “By laws of ancient usage tower on high, “And Innovation's dangerous stride defy.” “All things from this their real value claim. “Truth, Honour, Justice, Valour, Conscience, Fame,— “(Thro' every Rank, Priests, Mountebanks, and Kings,) “Have no more worth than each the Pence it brings. “And tho' Adepts may bounce, with Scruples nice, “'Tis but a bubble to increase the price; “(Save with some Fools, whom learned Pride misleads) “A stale, stock-jobbing Trick, which no one heeds. “For this the Statesman, clinging to the Purse, “Endures, without Remorse, his Country's Curse; “Endures the Scourge of headlong Party Rage, “And stands the Butt of an enquiring Age; “Without retreating from the searching Light, “Sees blacker Vices drag'd to public sight “Than, had he been of poor Plebeian Race, “Had justly doom'd him to a Rope's disgrace:— “Unblushing bears it all—for Gold, we know, “Outbrazening Brass, can Impudence bestow. “For this the Lawyer proves that Black is White; “Arnold for this upon both sides will fight, “By both despis'd. For this the Parson preaches, “The Doctor kills, and Burke for this impeaches, “From Year to Year draws out the tedious suit— “For Hastings would not fee him to be mute!— “Nay, chief, for this (if Fame aright declare,) “Charlotte and George delight the Crown to wear. “Blest source of Wealth! which leaves small Cause to dread “Their Babes (GOD bless them!) e'er should beg their Bread.” “Scarce had they finish'd when—A vulgar Bard Would tell you, by the Cock's shrill Clarion scar'd; But we, who true Description seek alone, Know that Cocks seldom crow in London Town;— Unless the Poet, for the Time of Need, Should keep one by him of Parnassian breed, Which, fed with Barley from the bi-fork'd hill, Stands, with arch'd Neck, to chuckle at his will.— Scarce had they finish'd—Oh! that now, so gay, My Muse might, thro' enamell'd Meadows, stray By Village side, whence Ploughmen whistle blithe, And the rude Mower whets his shining scythe, Or Milk-Maid trips, and, while her cleanly Pails Click at her side, the Morn with Carol hails, Or Shepherd Lad, with barking Cur beside, Hies to the Cot where bleat the fleecy pride! With Vernal Beauties then my Verse should shine; Some varied Landscape glow in every Line; Some balmy Zephyr thro' the waving Grove, In every Couplet, breathe the Sigh of Love; While the shrill Lark, or Horn's inspiring sound, Should scare the Spectres to their Haunts profound.— But Truth would here the Lark, the Horn disclaim: And simple Truth is all the Muse's aim.— Scarce had they finish'd, when thro' Chiswell Street (The MUSE's now, and ALPHABETA's Seat) A shrill loud Voice proclaim'd the scatter'd Gloom, And “Sweep Soot O!” resounded thro' the dome. The Spectres started. Straight each Shadowy Breast The faithful Harbinger of Morn confest. They melt to Air, as sooty, maim'd, and slow, Pass the sad Sons of Penury and Woe! Aurora's rush-light melted now away Before the flambeau of the God of Day, Whose broad unwelcome glare o'er house tops seen, Tips Betty's casement with refulgent sheen, And calls young Barnwell from her brawny arms, To 'scape, unseen, thro' gutters from her charms, Just time enough to let his master in, Reeling to business from the tavern's din. —Now bakers, on their dough-troughs yawn in state, Damn the assize, and shrink the destin'd weight; The midnight robber skulking hides his head, And unplied trulls steal pennyless to bed; While milk-maids haste to Islington, whose stream Mingles with milk to furnish London cream. —Now sprightly Billingsgate is just awake, And the throng'd Nereids their stations take: Sweet sound their treble pipes; each accent hung With Classic graces of the vulgar tongue; While Covent Garden echoes back the strain; Where throng the pastoral nymph and rural swain From Putney's, Battersea's, and Peckham's plain: Those Nymphs and Swains, whose rural Eclogues sweet Have oft made vocal Carpenter's retreat— Who knows not Carpenter's? whose early doors Ope with the dawn for hucksters, thieves, and whores, Rooks who with E. O. chace the midnight gloom, And poor gull'd Pigeons stripp'd of every plume; While jilts, culls, bullies, mingle with the throng, Pour the loud curse, and belch the reeling song. To these responsive, what blithe founds arise! Bid shops unfold, and house maids rub their eyes! “Primroses!” “Dust O!” “Lavender!” Old clothes!” And “Water Cresses!” banish dull repose; “Brick Dust!” “Sweep Soot O!” on the breezes swim And waft from street to street the matin hymn; While, in full chorus to the jocund lay, Carts rattle, drivers swear, and asses bray!— But dead to this blithe chorus of the morn Turns purse-proud Grandeur with an idle yawn, Bent to renew once more, in flattering dreams, His Dissipations or ambitious schemes. New forest 'closures sweeten Rose's sleep, And Smith's damn'd verdict from his memory keep. In Pitt's bright fancy bolder hopes arise— Unbounded sway, and general excise; Confiding Senates, Camps of Observation, To crush enquiry, and dragoon the nation, Navies and armaments, at Britain's cost, Foredoom'd to gain—of Patronage a host;— Foredoom'd to crush, (if Heaven their purpose aid) The impious crew who Rights of King's invade. For Dreams like these thrice strives Dundas in vain, While whip-gall'd Afric clanks the lengthen'd chain, And with fierce rage the wretch's bosom rends, Who damn'd her cause by joining with her friends. Thrice turns he round and sleeps; and thrice arise Grim hedious Spectres to his haggard eyes, Shrieking aloud “No more expect repose, “Till slow the guilty eighteenth Century close.” Again he turns. His country's curses swell Thick in his ear; and while the hedious yell Harrows his soul, the gibbet rears elate, And burning effigies foretel his fate, Tho' lawless magistrates wage Civil war To save with British blood the men of straw. Great Mammon Nimrod now, as when awake, Creeps to his store, a fond, fond glance to take; Laughs at an o'ertax'd people's groans, and cries, With goat-like mouth, and idiot glaring eyes, While, pile on pile, his seventeen millions swell, “What—what—what—what—don't all—all things go well;” Then, (tho' his purblind eyes, disloyal, fail To shew the difference 'twixt the mane and tail) Calls for his horse, and with heroic grace Braves all the pleasing dangers of the chace. By his herculian side sweet handmaid glows, Fair Hebe, blushing like a full blown Rose, That full blown Rose, whose shape she once assum'd, And bright on Covent Garden Hustings bloom'd, Till Argos eyes detect the treacherous thorn, To goad fair-Freedom's side malignant worn; At which, abash'd, she fled the light of Day, And hid beneath Minerva's buckler lay.— Thus fled the types when thro' the troubled sky Dread thundering Jove resistless beam'd on high: His awful wig of lightest hair around A star-gem'd diadem imperial frown'd, In front of which bright beam'd the radiant stone, An eastern Nabob lately call'd his own; Till at the altar of the thundering God, In supplication of his guardian nod, Submiss 'twas offer'd. Jove, as Gods are us'd, Receiv'd the offering, but the pray'r refus'd. —Dread was his presence: in his red right hand, Prepar'd to vindicate his high command, He grasps those thunders Alphabeta's care Had forg'd the terrors of his will to bear. Now when the adverse conflict he espies. With face of scarlet and grey rolling eyes, Sees types on types dispers'd, dismay'd, or slain, And Boydel raging thro' the ensanguin'd plain: Indignant wrath and keen resentment rise, And, What! what! what! with thick short speech, he cries; But could no more, for choler choak'd his tongue, And what! what! what! thro' heaven's wide concave rung. Scar'd Moorfields shakes, clouds tremble as they roll, Fork'd lightnings fly, big angry thunders growl, And what! what! what! chills every victor's soul. Scar'd Boydell flies, Woodmason's puff expires, And e'en thy deamon, Opie, slow retires. Jove throws his bolts thick scatter'd o'er the ground, And brands of heavenly fury blaze around. Thro' Britain's empire spreads the sacred ire, Prints every gate-house, post, and village spire, Whence gazing Rustics, wondering what is meant, Read dreadful words of treason, discontent, Sedition rumour'd, enemies to peace, And dread commands, that Reason's voice should cease. [Genius, or Muse, whate'er thou art! whose thrill] Genius, or Muse, whate'er thou art! whose thrill Prompts to my Poor brain to stain the Poet's quill, Makes like a ball sublime sensation roll, And trundles nonsense round from pole to pole; Who lov'st to throw thy wild ungovern'd gaze, Like a fierce madman's stare a thousand ways, Where starry Night, well-taught at Spitalfields, Weaves a thick stuff that to no tissue yields, And chasing Common Sense from off the globe, Leads the meek Moon, dressed in her cleanest robe, To ogle lustre from her chrystal eye, And deck the heav'ns with pearly panoply: Or whether random cast beside some stream, Which like a dishclout washes every beam, Thou ponder'st, philosophical, alone, As mute, and stupid as a senseless stone, Lull'd by nurse Sorrow's desultory groan, While from dark dell the plumed Minstrel's throat, Like the sweet screech-owl, tells its griefs by rote: Or dost thou hasten to the lawny vale, To lift to Bobby Merry's sawny Tale? &amp;c.” [Accurs'd remembrance of intestine rage!] Accurs'd remembrance of intestine rage! Lo! friend with friend, and kin with kin engage! Then frantic Britain arts and laws forsook, Let ploughshares rust, and broke the pastoral crook; While harpy Discord wak'd the brazen sound, Whose savage blast each social feeling drown'd, And call'd her hinds, in each fierce baron's train, To spread a bloody harvest o'er the plain; With War's dread scythe the horrent fields to mow, And lay the boast of human virtue low At each stern Master's feet, whose fickle pride Waver'd, in direful doubt, from side to side: As interest prompts (but dimly understood) As private pique, or daring thirst of blood, As sordid bribes, or harlot smiles inspire, Or spleenful Humour whets the fatal ire, Each brutal chieftain arms, with impious joy, And feels the dire ambition to destroy: Thro' kindred ranks red Slaughter breaks their way, And pomps of heraldry their crimes display. See, helm on helm, and thronging shield on shield, With proud devices darken all the field; From sword to sword the beamy horror plays, And from throng'd lances wasting lightnings blaze; While high in air the threatning banners spread, The white rose here, and there the flaunting red. The dire alarm prophetic vultures sound, And groaning myriads glut the purple ground; While titled heroes hence their honours claim, And float on vassal blood to impious fame. “O! thou, fond Many!” what hadst thou to do In kindred blood the corslet to imbrue? Ah! what avail'd the name the tyrant bore Who trod your necks, or tax'd your hard-earn'd store? One orphan'd babe defenceless left to sigh, One briny tear that wash'd the widow'd eye, If justly weigh'd, had wak'd a sharper pain Than Edward's exile, or than Henry's chain. But York's nor Lancaster's proud claims ye knew: For humbler tyrants ye the falchion drew. As herds to slaughter by their owners led, Dumb, and unconscious of the cause, ye bled: The titled ruffian the pretence supplied; And as he frown'd the abject million died: Each petty Jove, their madness to inflame, Shouts the dread thunder of his worship'd name; His blazon'd Ægis shakes; and thick they fall, Till universal Darkness threatens all:— O'er all the realm one night of Horror lowers, And huge Destruction, unrestrain'd, devours; With stride exulting stalks around the coast, And snuffs the offerings of each vassal host! O, frantic England! prodigal of blood! What stygian fury urg'd this impious mood— To rend thy entrails thus?—while foreign foes With grim delight behold thy savage woes— See, with proud joy, thy own victorious sword Turn'd on thy breast, with wilful fury gor'd, While the gaunt spectre of thy Martial Fame Fleets, like a Ghost, a wandering, empty name, Self slain, and doom'd thro' all the desert land To howl her guilt, and curse her frantic hand! So, hapless Britain! in a later age, I see thy sword against they Rights engage; See thee, in mad delusion, blindly pour Devoted armies on a foreign shore To aid the cause of tyranny, and buy Th'inglorious fetters freemen should destroy; Blind to the schemes by artful statesmen plann'd! And British Freedom falls on Gallia's strand: Self-slain she falls in wild, misguided zeal, And German Despots whet the fatal steel; Then shout triumphant; to their legions call, And hail the approaching hour of Britain's fall. Nor yet content might Titled Rage appear, Nor stop at Murder in her mad career: In bolder Crimes their feudal Pride prevail'd: Fair Faith is slain; and Heaven itself assail'd. See: on the sword yet stain'd with Yorkist blood, The changing hero, in indignant mood, Allegiance swears to York's expiring cause, And back to life the shrinking Faction draws: While he who late, the white rose on his crest, Gor'd struggling Lancaster's aspiring breast, Now stops the blood; recals the fleeting breath; And vows to York's proud race dismay and death. Now, front to front, in threatning wrath, behold Those painted targets and those helms of gold, Erewhile whose proud devices, side by side, Throng'd the same field, in amity allied; And he who late o'er some half-vanquish'd friend Rush'd the firm shield's protection to extend, Now barb'd with vengeance wings the thirsty dart, Or bathes his falchion in the suppliant's heart. No link of Friendship binds; no kindred tie; And oaths in vain their feeble aid supply: Nor pious awe, nor bond of Faith controls; (Limbs cas'd in steel, and adamantine souls!) Again they change, their broken leagues restore, And seal new perjuries in new streams of gore. Their ready slaves with blind obedience turn: Change as they change, and as they dictate burn: In either cause with equal zeal destroy; Pleas'd if their Lords the savage Fame enjoy. Chief of these noble locusts, in its rage Sent by offended Heaven to scourge the age, Stern Warwick, proud in brutal might, appears Hemm'd round with slaughters, devastations, fears. His raging breath, omnipotent in ill! Is drawn to stifle, and but flows to kill: Tyrants to tyrants in succession rise:— His voice creates them; and his frown destroys. Behold him now the cause of Edward own, And lift the gaudy pageant to the throne; That so the boy (whose vices speak his birth) Sprung from the Imperial Spoilers of the Earth! With England's treasures, and with England's dames May soothe his follies, and indulge his flames— O'erwearied Toil's extorted produce waste In scenes of riot, and lascivious taste;— Tear from the aged Matron's widow'd side (Widow'd perhaps to prop his regal pride!) The virgin treasure of her daughter's charms, To lie polluted in imperial arms;— Or doom the Husband, in the bloom of youth, To mourn the pangs of unrewarded truth, With guiltless shame his branded-forehead hide, And mourn in widow'd sheets a living bride, While the proud tyrant, whom his wealth sustains, Feasts on his wrongs, and riots in his pains. But scenes like these the milder woes display That mark the ravages of kingly sway: And panting Britain, worn with slaughtering toils, Amid these humbler crimes indulgent smiles:— Pleas'd the short ray of transient Peace to gain, O'erlooks the princely vices in her train, And deems it bliss nought heavier to support Than the lewd pastimes of a wasteful court. But, lo! in tears another Helen came: With tears of oil to feed the dying flame, Renew the wasting fires of Civil Rage, And give to Slaughter's reign another age. The British Paris feasts his wanton soul (For what are Kings, if Reason must control!) Fearless of injur'd Nevil's dangerous ire, Hail's the fair sovereign of an hour's desire; And Civil Discord lights the Nuptial Fire. Stern Warwick heard, as from the Gallic shore His prosperous sail the plighted princess bore, He heard: and like a thunderbolt he came, That strikes some reverend Abbey's Gothic frame, And while convulsive Nature rocks around Lays it a smoking ruin on the ground, (Its stately fanes, its pageant trophies torn And all that distant ages vainly mourn,) While prostrate crowds that worship in the quire, Crush'd in the hideous shock, with unheard groans expire. Behold, again, from Power's polluted seat, The vain, ungrateful libertine retreat; While monkish Henry, with his haughty queen, (Wanton her heart, and insolent her mien!)— This call'd from exile, that the dungeon's gloom, Again the fickle diadem assume, And his stern power with grateful transport hail, Who turn'd so oft their sanguine faction pale. Poor groaning land whom equal ills betray Beneath an idiot's or a tyrant's sway! Thy people slaves; a proud, but powerless throne, Propp'd by the nobles' force, and not its own; Those nobles, lost, as all vain nobles are To every liberal patriotic care! Honour the exclusive name with which they grace The pompous vices of their selfish race! Scorning the crowd upon whose necks they ride! Dead to each sense, but lust and giddy pride! For them in War our wealth—our blood we show'r,— And what War spares their Luxuries devour!— Their gaudy crimes how long shall Britain brook, Ere her bold offspring snap the galling Yoke? Their swords again the factious Barons draw— “Swords and strong arms their conscience and their law!” For faithless Edward still a host attends, Whose interests, or whose passions are his friends. Here, to this spot—whose guilty turf appears Manur'd with blood and wet with orphans' tears; And still where hovering ghosts, with boding strain, To Fancy's ear of cruel Fate complain, That urg'd them, for Ambition's ruthless strife, To slight each fond regard of social life; To leave unpropp'd a parent's hoary age, In some proud chieftain's quarrel to engage; For midnight marches and the din of arms, To fly the virgin's yet untasted charms; Or leave the widow o'er her babe to mourn, And weep for joys that never must return! While they (what furies human bosoms tear!) Bled for the chains the rising race should wear.— —Here, to this spot, the raging squadrons throng, While kindred hate drives each fierce host along, And banner'd omens, gleaming thro' the air, The direful issue of the day declare. Two raging dog-stars, scattering plagues and death, Flame in their van, and scorch the blasted heath: This, darting far, its coruscations sends, And all around destroys—or foes, or friends. With like contag on strikes the random fire, Till all extinct the fatal flame expire: While that, still raging with insatiate blaze, Pours, in collected wrath, its blasting rays; Shakes o'er the foe its red destroying hair, That sheds infectious horror and despair; Exhaustless flames with pestilential ire, And floods the ensanguin'd field with one wide wasting fire. Such the dire omens through the lowering sky, That o'er the hostile legions wave on high: For thus, while Death shrieks out the hideous yell, And hovering furies chaunt the direful spell, Grim o'er their looms the fatal sisters weave, And fiends of Havock the dire webs receive; Then haste, and, shrieking, with portentous glare, O'er the stern ranks the threat'ning signals bear; Sound the loud blast; the general carnage hail; And wait the incense of the tainted gale. Too soon, alas! that tainted gale shall rise, Clogg the griev'd air, and blot the weeping skies! For, lo! they meet: wounds answering wounds they deal, Strain the tough Yew, and drench the murd'rous steel; Thro' kindred bands the mace—the falchion hew, Loud strokes resound, and dying groans pursue; Stones, spears, and darts in slaughtering tempests rain, And helms and hauberks sheathe the ranks in vain,— Heralds in vain the trophied targe supply, Cleft shields and broken lances useless lie, While roll promiscuous o'er the trampled plain, Steeds, arms, and men—the dying and the slain. The martial Spirit of Britannia's Isles— (Whose brandish'd lightnings aid her patriot toils— Whose steady hand, when Truth contends with Might, Uplifts the ballance of eternal right; And, when in awful panoply array'd, Indignant Freedom claims her guardian aid, Descends in terrors to the warrior maid; With Heaven's own thunders aids the sacred cause, And proud Ambition's tyrant bosom awes!)— Shock'd with a scene where Violence and Pride And Perjur'd Guilt alone for empire vied, In darker folds her sea green mantle spread, And veil'd the beaming glories of her head; Call'd from the impious scene her bands away, And left to warring fiends the doubtful day: (As tho' to scourge the factious race inclin'd, And leave a dread memorial to mankind!) The warrior cherubin her call obey; Their flaming falchions sheathe, their wings display, And seek the realms of empyrean day: Yet, lingering, oft, with backward glance, deplore The long-protected haunts of Albion's rocky shore. With clouded radiance, and abated fires, Westward, meanwhile, the sickening sun retires; Involves his brow to shun the slaughtering sight; And Night and Chaos threat the closing fight— When now blind Chance, not Justice, lifts the scales; And Edward's fortune in the strife prevails; For Warwick, bent with one decisive blow To strike deep terror in the yielding foe, Calls his choice band (who yet inactive lay To watch the changing fortunes of the day) With sudden aid his phalanx to sustain, Inspire the drooping, and replace the slain; When, lo! the banners flaming in the rear, And shouts loud echoing in the startled ear, (Thro' clouds of dust while doubtful meteors gleam) To the gall'd ranks a hostile ambush seem. Loud cries of vengeance speak their brave despair: Raging they turn; as wolves their hunters tear:— Or as the Elephant, whose giant might Is arm'd by Nature for resistless fight, His haughty rage by martial art increas'd, Tramples the myriad armies of the east— Then (gall'd with wounds, and frantic with his pain) Turns on his friends; assails the shrinking train; And with promiscuous carnage strews the plain. So turns the tide of this disastrous day, And their own swords the Earl's fierce squadrons slay: Friend falls by friend, on comrades comrades charge; And raging Devastation stalks at large— O'er hills of slain his limbs enormous rears, Joins the loud shout, and thunders in their ears; Calls to their destin'd feast his vulture brood; Whets his keen fangs, and bathes his lips with blood; While frighted Pity, shrieking o'er the plain, Bares her white breast, and wrings her hands in vain. While thus the “Dogs of War,” with wild despair, Those who “let slip” their furious havoc tear, The bated chief, who stain'd his tusks with gore, “And made the forests tremble with his roar,” Among his hunters long, indignant, stands O'er the strew'd wreck of his disorder'd bands; This way and that the deathful fury deals, And tenfold rage his hopeless pangs reveals; Resolv'd, and furious, in this closing strife To crown the savage slaughters of his life; Till, sate-commission'd, flies the thirsting dart, Drives thro' his breast, and quivers in his heart— Here, on this spot, perhaps, where now I tread, Writhing in death his mighty limbs were spread; And while his vassals, prodigal of blood, Pour'd on his tyrant corse the vital flood, And kept alive the dying flame of fight Till added deaths appeas'd his sullen sprite, In dust and blood sob'd forth that fiery soul Earth could not hold, and Heaven could scarce control. [Thee, beauteous tint! our eyes with rapture view] Thee, beauteous tint! our eyes with rapture view; For ever common, yet for ever new! With boundless joy pursue thy boundless shades, And ever sicken as thy freshness fades. Denied thy charms, how pines the drooping sprite, (Like the fond maid forbade her lover's sight!) What arts we try one transient glance to gain! How wooe that transient glance with anxious pain! Proud, and well-pleas'd with all our careful toil, If but one window boast thy languid smile! THE EPITHALAMIUM. Sportive Lyre, whose artless strings, Brush'd by young Affection's wings, (Nymphs and rustics list'ning round) Whisper'd sweet the varied sound— Sounds which only aim'd to borrow Pathos from the youthful heart,— Thrills of Hope, and Sighs of Sorrow— Fleeting joy, and transient smart!— Sportive Lyre! ah, once again— Once again, and then no more— Let me wake the youthful strain, And thy playful strings explore. Once again—and then, adieu!— Bolder heights my soul shall try: Bolder objects rise in view— Truth and godlike Liberty!: To these my eye enamour'd turns: For these my ardent bosom burns: Let these alone my thoughts employ— Truth and godlike Liberty! Rous'd by these, my glowing soul Pants a nobler wreath to gain;— Pants for Glory's patriot goal, Where the daring Virtues reign! Pants to hear the graver Muse Wake the loud enthusiast shell Whose notes heroic pride infuse And bid the soul with ardour swell:— Noble Ardour!—virtuous Zeal! Parent of each generous deed; Guardian of the public weal, For which the valiant joy to bleed. Thoughts like these, from hence, alone, Shall this glowing bosom own:— Thoughts that lift the soul on high To make its own Eternity, And with Meonian rapture swell The notes of Fame's immortal shell. Meanwhile, Iö Hymen! thy triumphs I join,— My Fancy awhile to thy ardours resign: Those ardours which oft, when anxiety reigns, When the nerves wildly throb, or when languid the veins, By Stella awakened, pour balm thro' my soul, Lull to sleep every pang, and each sorrow control, And, chacing each passion that peace would destroy, Restore me to harmony, softness, and joy;— Those ardours by Nature indulgently given To realize all that is look'd for in heaven,— To unite us in bonds of affection and peace, And bid the rude struggles of selfishness cease, Till, heart link'd to heart, all the universe smile, And Social Affection each sorrow beguile, While Sympathy's touch shall the union sustain, And vibrate alike thro' each link of the chain. Yes such, if by Nature conducted, and join'd Not by Interest and Pride, but the tie of the mind, Sex blended with sex from affection alone, And Simplicity made every bosom its throne— Such, such are the blessings from Hymen would flow, And this wilderness turn to an Eden below:— An Eden of Mind where each virtue should blow. Then, Iö! thou Hymen that reign'st o'er the few Who boldly the dictates of Nature pursue! Blest power! who alone to the virtuous art known Whose bosoms the charm of Simplicity own, While a sordid Impostor, usurping thy name, Of throngs of proud votaries the homage can claim— The creatures of Fashion, of Avarice the slaves, Whom Vanity leads, and each folly depraves. But see, what kind omens bright dawning appear, The patriot bosom of Virtue to cheer!— Simplicity comes, by fair Liberty led, And Hymen—pure Hymen shall lift up his head. Each Social Affection once more shall return, And the altar of Truth with pure incense shall burn, While Love, like the Phœnix, shall rise from the flame, His laws shall restore, and his saboth proclaim; And, wide thro' the Heaven's his broad pinions unfurl'd, Shall shake his bright plumes, and shed peace o'er the world.
