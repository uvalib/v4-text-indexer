      <field name="fulltext">THE LIFE AND ADVENTURE of BOB THIN: A POLITICAL—PHILOSOPHICAL—HISTORICAL—BIOGRAPHICAL—ANECDOTICAL—ALLEGORICAL— PARENTHETICAL—PATHETICAL—PROPHETICAL—POETICAL—LOGICAL—METRICAL—AND MORAL NEW POOR—LAW TALE. Men like not prosy tales: we'll try How doggrel rhyme fits history. Time was when every man was free To manage his own cookery: Whether he got it in the chase, Or grew and eat it in same place. This was old time, long ere the days When “merrie England” bask'd in the blaze— Now, blessings on her wrizled face!— Of royal Betty's summer glory: Those were the days to come before ye. And here, though it delay our story, We must indulge our loyal pen With a laudatory paren- Thesis, to tell of Betty's goodness, Trusting to be excused our rudeness. Bet's sire (well, Liza's, at your pleasure) Was one who knew no law but the measure Of's will—a most elastic tether: He had (and some make question whether 'Twas done of grace or despotism) Taken advantage of a schism Among the shepherds who care for souls, To spoil some of their fishes and rolls. That is to say, he turn'd adrift Sundry friars, out of whose thrift— Rogues as they might be, ne'ertheless— The poor had succour in distress. Beggars and monks were told to shift. Woe to the poor! till glorious Bess (Who wink'd not, save at manliness) Swore by 'od's teeth, her father's oath, (A practice to which she was not loath) That every man had a right to live, Even though his labour might not thrive. Who bars the claim of one past labour To share the abundance of his neighbour, Denies the right of Pity, sent By Heaven to be the muniment Of Justice, else most justly shent. This was the law by Nature given, When man, unbreech'd, unshod, was driven From the untailor'd paradise— That garden of content which lies, According to our clearest notion, Some leagues beyond the extremest ocean; Or, in more measured words express'd, Just fifteen paces to the west Of the angel with the flaming sword: But, quitting this, which (take our word!) Is an insolvent speculation, To jog along with our narration; Let us endeavour to unravel The tortuous track of human travel, Out of the naked innocence, Through the rude windings of offence, To that sophisticated morn Which witness'd our tale's hero born. Well, as we said, in the olden days, When ladies never miss'd their stays (Because, in truth, they'd not been granted: A cherub might as well have panted For a dandy pair of pantaloons, Or whale have sigh'd for table-spoons:) Days more than “golden,” double-worth'd, When horrible gold was all unearth'd— The days of Natural Equal- Ity and property for all; There were no Poor-laws, for this good Reason, that no man wanted food; And none on's neighbour any ravages Committed; till at length some savages, A lordly, idle set of stoats, Seized peaceful husbandman by th' throats, And over Nature's gentlest code, On roaring Rapine rough-shod rode. Here is the origin of what Is call'd the law of scot and lot. After a time, a cunning rascal, Almost as 'cute a chap as Pascal Was in geometry, to invent A plan by which to circumvent The aristocratic testament, Set wits to work, and money made, Merely to accommodate his trade,— A sort of circulating medium By which men might redeem the tedium Of the antique clumsy bartering,— How to swop all and every thing. Then ships were built, and cities stood On site of many a noble wood; And, 'stead of breaking lances featly, Men learnt to bleed a pocket neatly, Till war, defrauded of his “sinews,” Lay a bound Triton 'mong the minnows— Like Gulliver at Lilliput, Or knight head-stuck in muddy rut. So stepp'd our world from times as Goth wild, To the very presence of a Rothschild; Till even “this corner of the west” Got shares in civilization's best. Now, to apply the application To the back of our own happy nation:— We've had our scions of misrule, Of the illegitimate Norman school, Who've laid our husbandmen in bond— Like eels pent up in shallow pond— Curfewing us, and then with “charters” Just lighting some to adore their garters; All this we've borne, and worse behind, The money-men who “sow the wind,” And “bills of rights” by taxes paid— Like child by its mother overlaid— Till, what with thief's and murderer's ration, We've cross'd to a tarnation station— At least a break-leg elevation. We've told how royal Betsy swore, That rights of right belong'd to the poor: Of late the Solons of the nation Out of their bag of legislation (The bag o' the spider, not o' the bee) Have spun a web, a twist of three, Of such a monstrous complication— Good meanings it is said pave hell: There's not a doubt but they meant well— It threats the poor with worse starvation Than when bluff Harry kick'd the monks out: Our tale will show you what 'tis about. “Your introduction tires the reader: Directly with your tale proceed!” Y'ur Honour's will shall be obey'd. Bob Thin a weaver was, by trade; An honest lad and most industrious— Therefore, we dare to say it, illustrious. One who would ply his busy loom From dawn to the very “crack of doom”; Of kindly nature; one who never Turn'd back on needy brother weaver. These were Bob's virtues; place he had, too, In the 'bus that every man is cad to— And woman eke, since Eve bit apple— Sin's 'bus, that thunders thro' Whitechapel, The regularest 'bus of fifty: In plain terms, Bob was not owre thrifty; He had (the truth, Sir, must be told) A most immoral scorn of gold. He hadn't learnt it from his vicar; Nor he from the extra-reverend thicker- Bodied and crowned bench of pastors, Who, cheek by jowl with our lay masters, Make Poor-laws for us working folk; Playing the parts of nave and spoke In the common wheel that over-rolls, Like Juggernaut, the prostrate shoals Of worshippers, with an oppression Most damnable; excuse the expression! To our tale:—One day, in's Sunday coat, Bob heard out of the parson's throat— One Dr. M.; not M. who wrote— God's holy law and warranty For man to “increase and multiply”; And found not in the sacred text, To “pause, lest overseers be vext.” So, though his household gear was scanty, And scant the furniture of pantry, Zealous for virtue, Bob got wed; Too soon more mouths had to be fed. Till, what with more of bairns than money, Bob's hive was stock'd with want of honey. No matter—trade was brisk; and Bob 'D work till his finger-ends would throb:— But hold! let us philosophise. Whoever send us mouths and eyes, 'Tis plain as pikestaff, Providence (We say it, meaning no offence) Don't always send a weaver work, Or even an extra knife and fork, Because his family increases: The inference is just what pleases The reader; we resume our story. Years roll'd along in honest glory Bob fed two children—three—and four; But when a fifth knock'd at the door (No-Work had just proclaim'd a fast) It must be own'd Bob look'd aghast. What's to be done? a host of neighbours Have had (some whim of Trade) their labours Suspended; Misery looks garish: Lean Bob must come upon his parish. As shipwreck'd seamen come on rocks To starve, secure from tempest-shocks, Storm-driven Bob and family Must quit—few know how ruefully— The home of their prosperity. But wherefore this? will none lend aid Until a kindly turn of Trade Shall set Bob on his legs again? Alas! the poor man pleads in vain. Christian Respectability Just gives out of its charity A cold, “Lay by for a rainy day”; And Poor-law mediciners say, Out-door relief induces fraud, Except when granted to a lord, And spoils the incentive to endeavour In all but the gentleman-receiver. Poor reasons why the innocent From their own hearth-stones should be sent To a cold workhouse! yet no better Were given in the Bishop's letter. In Campden-gardens, Bethnal-green, Bob's homestead was, not over clean, Nor in most healthy atmosphere; Lying unfortunately near To Lamb's-fields' marsh, a stagnant pool Of some three hundred square feet, full Of the spawn of dire contagion, which Dwelt rankly there and in a ditch That skirted North-street, neighbourly. The weltering ditch crawl'd filthily, Yet with most kind, though lame, endeavour To drain the place, which landlord never Attempted: he could let his hovels, Why pay for sanatory shovels? No law sets bounds to the landlord's wealth, Albeit his rent is his tenant's health Transmuted. This locality Was a Mr. Christian's property; He leased it of one General Fever, Ground landlord of the estate of Weaver. The fine, an occasional weaver's life (No matter if 'twere child or wife), Paid regularly to the thrilling Of the owner's heart and pocket filling Alternately: 'twas very strange, Good tenants were so given to change. The atmosphere, we said, was sickly, With wretched dwellings planted thickly, Weavers' “and else,” all sons of toil, Born serfs of this most loathly soil, This drainless swamp, by landlords clogg'd, Whose lives unholy gain so fogg'd, No charity might enter in To cheer the misers' wintering. Even in this place of misery Lived Bob in his prosperity; In a poor-furnish'd, “two-room'd” hole, Undrain'd, unventilated, foul, Mean, miserable as the soul Of landlord Christian: yet Bob spun From morn till “dewy eve,” was one Whose labour never was relax'd, Who had been duly christen'd, tax'd, And rated; and thus lived in the lees Of a fat-bishop'd diocese. But Bob's was no uncommon case: He fared like others of his race, Of the working Pariah caste, who meet ye In the heart of London's wealthiest city— London for “charities” renown'd; Despite the daily traces found Of hoary Squalor's crippled feet 'Twixt Lambeth and Threadneedle-street. Squalor resides in Bethnal-green! And there, oftimes, our gracious Queen Cheereth not with her lustrous face The common dimness of the place; Though she delighted, it is said, To see Van Amburgh's lions fed; God bless her Majesty's sweet features! Lions are interesting creatures. Yet, Lady! would it not be grander To feed the hungry poor who wander, Through all weather, early and late, To and fro—for they dare not wait— Before your guarded palace-gate: With whom even Pimlico abounds, Worse cared for than your Grace's hounds? The very dogs lick'd Lazarus' wounds. Good God! The court-fool stops us short:— What! Famine introduced at Court? Peace, grumbler! it has been determined, At the suggestion of an ermined Prime Minister, whom we would rather Not mention, that the reverend father In God, his grace the Metropoli- Tan, so eminently quali- Fied for any liberal act Tow'rd Christian poor—we give no fact, But state it on authority— That he and her dear Majesty On voyage of discovery Will start, early some sunny morn, To visit Christianly the lorn Abodes of labour to be seen In the province of far Bethnal-green. We've paced the distance, and have found, To cross the intervening ground, From Buckingham Palace to Bob Thin's door, Would take the Royal Coach just one hour. Then there's the guards' and horses' trappings, Not to be donn'd like beggars' wrappings (So that, indeed, 'twould be a feat Worthy the poet-laureate, Bob's namesake): and his holiness, In imitative humbleness, Might walk as far 'twixt lunch and dinner, Bussing it back, and be no thinner. If it be only food, indeed, The wretched Bethnal-greeners need, He will prescribe, with looks right rueful, Just eight or ten new churches, pew-full. If these suffice not, we believe Our generous Queen is sure to give, Her famish'd subjects to relieve, Ungrudgingly, suppose we say, Out of her thousand pounds a day, One hundred; and the holy bishop A tithe out of the profits of his shop, Split into shillings, and so given, At the labourer's weekly rate of seven, 'Twould clear some thousand homes of sorrow. But Queen nor Father 'll go to-morrow. What odds? the Poor-law fills their places With its vice-royal, saintly graces. Back to our tale. Bob's family Quit, as we said, most ruefully, The home of their prosperity. Who loves not home, however poor? Yourself the master of the door; There, though sore hunted, to be free:— What wretch would choose captivity? Bob had no choice; relief forbidden To all but those in a workhouse hidden, Under the “regulations.” He Might choose to starve at liberty, Alone, but, for his family's sake, Must bow his honest pride to take The felon chain and prison rations Of the “amendment” regulations. Alas! he may not claim a bone Even in the workhouse:—be it known, Though Bethnal-green might own his sire, That Bob was born in Monmouthshire: And, therefore, 'twas most fit and proper He should be deemed an interloper In Bethnal Union, where abound Such men as the Samaritan found, But few Samaritans—no libel; They're Christians, and believe the Bible. Nor may their justice tolerate Any addition to the rate, To burden men of wealth, whose profit Bob spun, though he might share none of it. “But had he no right to relief?” None. “Why?” We'll answer you in brief: What claim has the beggar on his thief? The “Guardians” smiled their sage approval, And duly order'd the removal Of the strange paupers: so they sent The wretches to their “settlement”— Let no man call it punishment. 'Twas for his own convenience' sake: When the now-slumbering trade should wake, He'd be so handy to resume His place at the accustom'd loom:— So care they for the poor man's doom. Now, as the cart of charity glode With easy carriage on the road, Bob thought he might as well beguile With converse close his travel-while. Question and answer came as follows:— Quoth Question, out of Bob's cheek-hollows, While Answer sate with arms a-kimbo,— Pray tell me why I'm set in limbo?— Answer—Because the Well-to-do Can find no better use for you.— What right have they to order me?— Answer—The right of property.— Question again—But how invented? It can't be shown that I consented: And every compact doth demand Two parties.—You will understand, Replies the other, your assent Was duly given by Parliament, Your representatives, and—Stay! Will you be good enough to say, How these same representers got At the will of one who had no vote?— Answer—My friend! you are not able To comprehend this veritable Fair feature of our Constitution, Which—Favour me with a solution Of that fine-sounding word! What is't?— Hereupon Answer clench'd his fist, Eloquently.—Will tell me where It may be found?—Reply, a stare, And sort of clutching at the air, After a phantom; then a frown, Which fairly knock'd the Question down: At last came words:—It is not fit That poor men should in judgment sit On this most reverend mystery. If you examine history, The courtly Hume's, where he relates Of 1688's Most Dutch and glorious “Revolution,” King William and his Constitution, And the “Convention,” you will see How Parliament right loyally Confirm'd the Hollander's accession, For having ratified their session. It follows, as a thing of course, As good things ever must grow worse By alteration, that the code, Even the horse King William rode, Which our wise ancestors approved Should by their sons be ne'er improved Throughout all time.—Bob heard no more Until the party reach'd the door Of Godstone Union poorhouse, where, After the usual courtesies, And introduction of the keys, They were admitted to the care Of the poorhouse king, a sort of human Xyster—May the Lord keep you, man, And all who read this true relation, Out of his sphere of operation! Here man and wife were torn asunder: God-join'd, but to be parted under The “regulations”: each one buried From the other's wretchedness; both hurried Into their lonely graves. For the rest, Their treatment was not of the best. One item may suffice to show How careful of each other's woe Are human things, albeit extremely Zealous to wear a visage seemly As fairest-whiten'd sepulchre:— Look at that tomb of the labourer, Yon profit-plaster'd villain; Sir! Though his hoarded wealth is the charnel-dew, Though he stole the byeword of the Jew, Verily he will prate to you Of the great Improvidence; nor tinge His corpse-face, though a man should twinge His “soul” with the workhouse “dietary”— Food being ruled a necessary. Pray you to note how the profit-monger Caters for those who can work no longer! For breakfast—bread, not without stint: The men have seven ounces, and a pint And half of skilly—a thin kind Of “gruel,” such as you can find Nowhere except on the hard tables Of “regulation” human stables. For dinner—meat, five ounces twice Each week; “potato-hash”; soup; rice, Nearly a pound; coarse bread, and cheese, Two ounces of the latter: these Are their alternate luxuries. When millionaires can wring no more Out of the earnings of the poor, Thus does their charity atone For their cupidity. 'Tis done (At least, so poor-law doctors say) For the labourers' benefit, that they May hang upon their own resources; Meanwhile in his plethoric courses The master wallows. Who shall wrest The portion of the poor opprest? Bob, from his wife and children parted, Droops in his prison, broken-hearted. He dreameth not of better days, His sorrow-glazed and stolid gaze Shutter'd with hopelessness; and curst, As of all criminals the worst, He buries in his “infamy” The care of life, and fain would die. His very life is lifeless torpor: Bob Thin is changed into the Pauper. So crept long years upon the dark Sands of his life; nor left a mark. Even as a mouldering desert-stone, Was he in the human world—alone. At length the dropping of despair Outwore his patience, even there, In the poorhouse; so the pauper fled Into the air. Long wandered The unpursued, unknowing aim, A rugged way, until night came; Then, on the road-side's dreariness, O'erladen with his weariness, He sank exhausted; there, around His shatter'd form kind Slumber wound Her arms:—Let no rude stir unbind 'em! Would you know more of him, you'll find him, In the next part, beneath an oak. THE POORHOUSE FUGITIVE: BEING THE SEQUEL TO BOB THIN. Twas morning when the Sleeper woke: A bright, spring-wreathéd morn, whose look Of warm, fresh joyance, with a tone Of kindliness long-time unknown, To the heart of the worn Pauper spoke. 'Twas like a gentle mother smiling On a sick infant, and beguiling Its pain with fond entanglement Of her caresses: so was bent Over the lone man's poverty The fair day, smiling healthfully. In the deep grief-tracks of his brow And wither'd cheeks he felt the press Of gentlest kisses, to and fro Stealing in their tenderness, With delicious whispering Of gracious Nature's sympathy Ever to us ministering; Even in that holy alchemy His frozen eye was sunn'd again, His wrinkled lip forgot its pain; And as the child, whose ail subsideth, In its mother's bosom hideth All its former restlessness— So the old-time fretfulness Of the grey man's spirit sank On the genial earth, which drank The memory of his wretchedness; Till again on the clear sky He looked with unfaltering eye. The pauper waketh on a bed Of mossy gold, gold-canopied By the new oak-buds God-yspread. 'Tis a morn of blithest weather; Such a morn as blends together Snow-piled hearts and youthful feeling, With a mighty love-annealing. Where, but yesternight, the road Like a desert pathway show'd, With its traffic-dust obscuring The sweet flowers, of God's procuring, Prison'd to its ruléd side, Troops of flowers, heaven-eyed, Wander now; and lazily Through their blooms the road doth glide, Serpent-like and mazily: And the flowers in peace abide. Yester-even, far and wide, Naked fields on either hand Mock'd the traveller's weary eye; Now his pleasant way is spann'd With delicatest tracery, Throng'd with gamesome choristers; And the tiniest blade that stirs, At the calling of the breeze That lull'd the old man's memories, Seems instinct with melody: Till the charmed sense doth pine In an ecstacy divine. Such was the wondrous change that met The gaze of the Poorhouse Fugitive: He knoweth not if he may live; Is he awake, or dreaming yet? Or was his former life a dream? Or are all things but as they seem? He knoweth nought. The youngling tree, Where he had flung his misery, Seems century-lined: what may this be? And now, over the pearled grass With which the road is carpeted, A group of noble figures pass, Appropriately habited: Symmetried forms, whose graceful dress Hides not their natural comeliness: Women and men. His spirit quails In their high presences: as pales The dull night when the royal Sun Steppeth on earth, even so doth he Shrink from that goodly company: With a vain bashfulness: for One, A woman glorious as the day, Sees him, and he perforce must stay; And faintly her behest awaits. Her snaky lips, with smiles apart, Seem'd like the hospitable gates Of the bower-palace of a heart Full-honey'd as the fragrant cells Young insects open; her deep eyes Clear-azured, heaven-reflecting wells Of ever-gushing harmonies— A mooned chorus; and the sound Of her rich language was of such Intensest witchery, it wound A never-failing echo round The listener's heart, while it did touch The dominant chord within him. She Sail'd tow'rd the rapt man greetingly, Inquiring with some wonderment, Of his new coming and intent; But he was mute: he dared not mar The lingering cadence of her speech With the poor words within his reach. Ah, me! how meanly furnish'd are Our tongues, of our desires to teach! The lady led him by the hand Toward that goodly company; Who met him with a welcome bland, And, without further scrutiny, Besought the stranger, if his hest Might brook delay, to be their guest. God! how the tears slid down the cheeks Of the Unscourged One; he speaks His gratitude, all loutingly; Whereat they wonder seriously, Beholding age so humbly borne. “Father! why bowed thus? Art worn With some strange grief? We, who have known None other home-companion Save Joy, will solace thee, if thou Wilt journey with us.” To the brow Of the grey-man's soul the tonguéd flame Of comfort leaps; with glad acclaim He pays assent: together fare They onward, through the clear spring air. Sudden their pleasant footway raught The brow of an out-looking hill, Which at that very moment caught Upon its wreathéd window-sill The yellow morning's first eye-twinkling, Its blady tips and flowers sprinkling With many an Iris-stolen gem Of changeful hue, transmuting them Into a royal diadem For the true-watching hill. Hereon The travellers halted; and anon, Preluding in each other's eyes The purport of their song, did don Fresh greetings with these melodies:— HYMN TO THE SUN. Thou, whose shadow is forethrown To blushing clouds that scarce have ceased Dreaming of thy “good-night” tone; Early kisser of the East— Which the lark, thy trumpeter, To the noon-sky telleth blithely: We, as earlily astir, Welcome thine uprising, lithely! Hail! all hail! Thou, whose radiant visage peereth Through yon grey hill's golden hair— Round thee flung as if to hold thee Ever throned and smiling there— Haste! the lowly would behold thee; Thou, whose fervent beauty weareth Silvery ether as a veil, Haste! the innermost stream must fold thee! Hail! all hail! Hail! thou rejoicing witnesser Of human joy; swarth vine-dresser Of joyance, whose ripe fruitage blesses Earth's secretest recesses,— Hailing thy glances unashamed, As we now greet thee: hasten, Lest the purple hours be blamed! With zealous care we fasten Thy many-color'd sandals on; Earth panteth for thee. Beauty must be won! Hail to thee! hail! all hail! Musing, the Pauper stood alone, In silence, yet not sullenly, But smiling tremulously, like one Not heedless of another's glee, Though his own heart hath lost its tone; Till now, their morning service done, They care to break their fast. Their board A little daisied knoll, the sward Their pleasant couch, where each one takes An equal place: thus furnished, Their healthful catering is outspread By the youngest hands, whose love doth render Brisk service, courteous and tender. Choice their providing:—milk-white bread,— And delicate butter, scarce discern'd 'Mong primrose-flowers, as if churn'd By lady fairies,—and sweet cakes Of flavour various, to suit The fickle palate,—store of fruit— Conserves, and other sun-dried, full Of their fresh richness (like some hearts, Time-wrinkled yet still beautiful, Whose passion-shrivell'd depth imparts A hivéd sweetness),—milk yet warm As the taster's lips,—and thicken'd cream Of daintiest niceness:—one might deem No more were needful; yet the charm Of loveliest talk, behaviour glad— Best gratitude—doth superadd Delight to this deliciousness, Even as the sunny day doth bless The landscape's wide voluptuousness. Brief time sufficeth to content Their temperance, for the descent Even more hungry; eye-allured To leave their night-long fast uncured, And with gay feet their will o'ertake, Round the hill's waist, like a mad snake Or arm of wooing love, forethrown. O, for a free bird's vagrant wing, To track their mazy wandering, Weaving the glad hill's living zone; With the late “Pauper” by their side, A pilgrim travel-glorified! In sooth, 'twas an inviting scene By the swift sun beholden then From the opposite eminence: long miles Of hill and dale, and crystal streams Meeting the day-laugh with faint smiles, Such as, scarce waken'd from the dreams Of the white night that did eclipse Their evening splendor, on brides' lips Wait the first morning kiss. What know Or dream we of the electric flow And interchange of heart-contents Blending the voicéd elements? Deep unto deep aye answering, In the shadow of the silent wing Of the Eternal Passer.—On With the glad travellers! Nought is still In life or death. The healthful will Halts not, ever companioned By strenuous thought, clear as yon rill Now with us journeying—lately leapt From the o'erhanging mountain-head, As if the sun-engloried wept Its welling overflow of bliss. See how the wild-hair'd wavelets kiss The smooth-cheek'd pebbles; how they bound On, on; and many a sail-less boat, Scarce managing to keep afloat, Bear onward with them, round and round Whirl'd with its atom company, Whose sympathetic gaiety Mimics the mad brook's revelry. Now the impetuous streamlet rushes Over tiny precipices, With a tone of sweet defiance; Now from under emerald bushes, Like a glow-worm's ray, outgushes Thorough mossed interstices The new-wedded waves dividing; Now are the green bubbles hiding Underneath the palace-eaves Of the lowly primrose-leaves, While in closer re-alliance Speed the blithe waves on the way Of their merriest roundelay: Now chanting loudly, now low-breathing Joy-murmurings; anon enwreathing The bald crown of some sturdy stone; Thence, startled at his ancient frown, Leaping, with gurgling laughter, down; One over other tumbling them Carelessly 'thwart the rooty stem Of a grey oak that, father-like, Leans o'er the easy-temper'd dyke, Watchful; now are they blandly stroking The lank hair of the river-maid, Weed-like amid their kisses laid;— Peep in the stream! she is uplooking Through her green sedge veil; you may see Her lustrous brow and wavy limbs, And 'neath long eye-lashes the glee Of her deep-looks, and catch a glimpse Of ripply lips that laugh outright, Laughing there continually, In the ever-rocking light Nursing their hilarity,— Merrily, merrily. And merrily the streamlet singeth, As on and onward aye it springeth: Ever abroad its song it flingeth, Gloriously. We leap from the rock's sheer edge, Boisterously: With a shout and hearty laughter Fore and after, Joyously! Slide we over the mossy ledge, Lusciously, Dreaming deliciously: And an eternal roar rolls with us on our way. Clear is the young spring day! The thrilling laugh of childish glee, And sobs and bubbling mirth, are ours 'Mid the wild flowers,— The playful hours racing us through the heath, Down the hill-side racing us out of breath: And the eternal voice rolls o'er us sonorously. An organ thunder—the dim melody Of many instruments—a rushing throng Of men and voices—near a charmed song, Solemn afar, even as the voice of God;— And heaven is children-trod;— Over the many hills the same bright tune Singing to sun and moon; High company upon the hills we had; Were not we glad, Leaping from crag to crag? Leaping from crag to crag; Hiding behind the masses of the rocks; Deem'd from afar to be the shining flocks Of God upon the mountains fed, Everywhere scattered; Now as a silver thread Along the deep ravine The torrent speedeth; and again between The massed rocks, fall after fall, With uproar musical, Bounding from crag to crag, on travel we. Anon our passage free A mountain wall hath stopp'd; And we lie chafing in the fond distress Of wayward pettishness, Boiling with childish rage, Till gentler tones assuage Impetuosity. Still, still hold watch and ward! A postern is unbarr'd: Through the quick gap our damm'd-up waters gush All eagerly; And our high song hath dropp'd Adown the steeps of life, and youthhood's flush Floweth more steadily. Continueth our glee Through the wide meadows, through the long lush grass; Our jocund course between The great grand trees, who in our changeful glass Gaze, as a seer into a depth of dreams: Queenliest trees, proud-form'd, with port serene! And now our many streams Are blending, and the mountain alleys, Merged in one broad road, plunge toward the valleys, While o'er our torrent force the hill-song leaps. And here and there uppeeps Through grassy hair the rude and weird face Of some grey rock, one of the giant race Of our bleak birthplace, grey as the memories Of an uncultured world, the asperities Of our progressive life; and still in sight The ancient hill appears, its head in heaven; And little rustic homelinesses Welcome the mountain-born with flower-wreathing, Bright buttercups, primroses quiet-breathing, Rich-scented chestnut-bloom; And in the torrent's foam The sweet May dips her tresses, Scarcely distinct:—On, on the waves are driven; As o'er us the old mountain voice still hovers, And every turn discovers New beauty; other streamlets pour, Like other minds, their flood of thought, Or other beings influence, brought From many a distance, hour by hour; And the stream swells its volume, and the tide Of power is amplified; And earth is fertilized, field-glories wave, And human dwellings stand on either side; While with melodious stave The river saileth through the busy scene, And o'er it most serene The hill-song, like a heaven-burden, hovers. Now, like two eager lovers, Two fair streams mingle hearts, and our full song Is the quick panting of voluptuous life The harvest fields among, Beneath heaven-arched skies with blithest warblings rife: And our sunn'd face is flush'd even as a bride's; And many a trickling kiss in music glides, Like molten silver bells, our features o'er— A chorus liquefied of birds and flowers: Such ecstasy is ours. Yet still floats o'er our life the distant roar Of the far mountain hymn; God whispers as of old. Sweet converse hold The lovers, never more to be divided: Two streaming lives that from the first have glided Together-ward, two hearts into one fold. The travellers have embark'd, and sail, Smooth-water'd and with prosperous gale, The purpose of the day to greet: The old man with the weary feet Resting among them. Sure is he That angels are his company. On, on, by golden-vestured trees, Standing like thoughtful deities Beholding their own images In the clear current; by gay meads, And towering fertilities, And gorgeous growths sprung from the seeds Of the unforgotten Paradise; Above the dreamy world that lies In the river-depth,—of giant forest, Tangled dells and caves umbrageous, Labyrinths such as thou explorest With deep eye and thought courageous, When the mystic veil is riven Of the Spirit (such a world Seemeth in the waters furl'd): Through and over these they sail With smooth course; the gentle gale Echoing the dying fall Of the wavelets lyrical; The clear brow of blue-eyed heaven Smilingly o'erarching all. A glorious company are they Voyaging on the waters there, With hearts as warm and thoughts as gay And outward-brilliant as the day; And the old “Pauper” hath his share Of pleasantness, and, joy-beguiled, New-hearted as a little child, No longer sleepeth with despair, But looketh down the stream, and sees The current fighting with the breeze, Till, kindling in the noontide rays, The river seemeth one wide blaze Of emerald and diamond, Or as the river-god had donn'd A panoply of steel; and splashing Through green boughs the sun-looks glare, Like the eyes of wood-nymphs, flashing Through their shade of leafy hair; And, as over human fate Joy and sorrow alternate, Sunny sheen and cloudy shadow Pass o'er stream and banking meadow: The strong earth-heart underneath Thankfully continueth. And now the grey-man's wistful eyes Many on old scene recognise In the windings of the river; Making his worn lips to quiver With emotion violent. But the buried time mis-spent May not vex his memory. Look not back on misery Lagging far behind!—The noon Folds the sun in fierce embrace, Like two lovers, face to face, Mingling in a passion-swoon. And the travellers leap ashore; And toward the Place of Games Bear their upward course, with store Of hopeful strength that never lames; Nor pause on the hill-top to ponder On the wide, untrack'd river, yonder Calmly sloping to the sea, Like age toward eternity:— The lark in the sky sings merrily:— But to the bosom of the valley Whither their long voyage tended Stoutly step they, way-befriended Now by many groups that rally Tow'rd one purpose, till the road Is gladden'd with a mighty crowd. Beautiful the village show'd, In the forest heart embower'd; Every cottage over-flower'd, Every cottage link'd by flowers To its neighbour; every dwelling— With its garden plot, for use, Or for pomp voluptuous— Like a form of beauty, telling Of the spirit homed within, Of a soul of healthful powers All luxuriantly swelling Into perfect beauty: towers Of homeliest comfort, with the ease And graceful art of palaces,— Palace-nests amid the trees. Swift to your place! the games begin. From the palace gates are welling Glorious creatures, such as trod Eden by the side of God, Artist visions, form'd to please A Raphael or Praxitiles; To a glade o' the forest wending, With palm branches o'er them bending, With glad hymns and festal looks, And clear current as a brook's. And now in the amphitheatre Many a long way traveller Hath his seat; and room for all To behold the festival Under the massive boughs is found; And in the midst a cleared ground For the gamesters. Hush! the voice Of women, and the merry song Of children, bird-like, mounts among The branches, till the woods rejoice To echo that sweet treble; then The fuller tenor of the men Upbears the anthem on strong wings Of melody; and then again The solemn bass down-draws the strain Earthward. And now the twanging strings Of youthful archers, and the whiz O' the many arrows: yon fair boy With the golden locks—the prize is his, And his blue flower-like eyes are dew'd with joy. And now with starting eyes, and feet Scarce on the ground, tiptoe, and now O'er the smooth course and up the brow Of the rough broken hill, compete The wing'd-heel'd racers. Now their place The wrestlers take, and face to face Stand lock'd, till, for the strong embrace Incompetent, the overthrown Measures the soft turf; and a crown Of fragrance, and loud-clapping palms, Reward the victor; while kind alms Of great forbearance wreathe the fallen-down. And now, with practised eye and poise Most graceful, two scarce-bearded boys Confront each other; strong and wary And quick-handed; foil with foil Lightly engaged. The dexterous feint, And rapid lunge, and swifter parry, The recovery, the coil, The disentangling,—till one's breath is spent. A hit!—young oak-leaves for his head! Now the more strenuous games are sped: And weapon'd with keen words, with shield Of hard and lustrous sense, the field Prompt arguers take; nor with mere words Of logic, but with mighty swords Of forgéd thought maintain the war. And now the Poet, like a star Heading the Wise, his silver beams Pours mellowingly, till at the feet Of blessed childhood once again they meet, The Magi of the earth, folded in blissful dreams. The Poorhouse Fugitive, he deems That Sleep, mother of calm, is his, And all the soul-entangling bliss Her love can harbinger; he seems Bathed in delight, intoxicate With his new life. Hath he the key Of Faëry turn'd, and changed his state? Or hath he learn'd the mystery Of loveliness?—the eye perceives That only which the heart believes. The windows of the heart were dull; Now all around is beautiful. And One beside him doth relate The meaning of their festival: How met they to commemorate A great deliverance,—from all The ancient tyrannies of Wrong— The tyrannies of rank-grown Will, And sordid Trade (more selfish still), And all the errors that belong To the blind worker for self-gain, And all the miseries in his train Close following—corroding care, And waste of energies, despair Heart-deadening.—Even while he spoke, This song the chain of memory broke. THE SONG Beautiful is the human land Since Love returned home, To build with subtlest art In every boundless heart His high imperial palace, heaven-spann'd, Whence he may never roam. Bountiful is our Earth, For Love hath laid his hand Under her head, and she, Embraced voluptuously, And wonder-joy'd, unto a strange and grand And gentle life gives birth. Heaven-like is our home: For Love hath blessed Hope, And given his own pinions unto Toil; And Joy is as a splendor whose sole foil Is younger Joy; and Genius hath full scope To build the Eternal Dome. And happiness is ours; And over us the spray Of Time breaks tunefully, Baptizing us with glee By God's own hand; and evermore our way Is strown with flowers. And evermore our way Is strown with flowers And the song died away Amid the echoing showers Of buds and blossoms children-strown Over their homeward path. The glance Of the old stranger rested upon one Of the flower-children, in advance Of her companions. She appear'd Like his own child: and yet he fear'd— So awful was her loveliness— To speak unto her; so he stood Gazing, bewilder'd, in a mood Of mingled joy and thoughtfulness, Looking his question;—till she told How, in the dreariness of old,— In the world's twilight dim and cold,— An aged man, her ancestor, Had fled out of the daily burr Of dismalest captivity In Godstone Poorhouse, to the free Unpathed wilds, wherein 'twas thought He perish'd, for none gleaned aught Of his after life:— And this was he Who stood before them, wonder-clad, Their few-hours' visitant. Then had Full greetings to be poured forth To pledge the stranger, words of worth, Heart-words: so went they home. And he Goes homeward too, how happily! Not, as of yore, with tiréd heart And flagging spirit, and foot-sore; But even as one loath to depart Out of a pleasant day, whose lore O' the better wisdom through the dim Grey eventide will rest with him. That twilight-clipped happiness Hath better taught him than the stress Of a life's penance-wretchedness. So passeth he to happier hours; Benigner influences and powers Of good are round him, to upstay His limbs and bear him on his way Rejoicing to the garden bowers. And for the “Pauper's” memory— Let it be gently borne till we Sleep with him, and as peacefully.</field>
