      <field name="fulltext">MARTIALL Lib. I. Epig. Ad Catonem. When thou didst know the merry Feast Of jocund Flora was at best, Our solemn sports, how loosely free, And debonaire the vulgar be, Strict Cato, why didst thou intrude Into the seated multitude? Was it thy frolick here alone Only to enter and be gone? Ad Lectorem Epig. 2. This whom thou readst is he by thee required, Martiall, through all the world fam'd and desired, For sharpest Books of Epigrams, on whom (Ingenious Reader) living, without Tombe, Thou hast bestow'd that high and glorious wreath, Which seldome Poets after death receive. Ad Librum suum, Epig. 4. Among the Stationers th'hadst rather be (My litle Book) though my shelf's void for thee, Alas! thou knowst not Madam Rome's disdain, Great Mars his sons are of a pregnant brain, Gybes no where are more free: young men and old, And Boyes their Nose up in derision hold, Whiles thou shalt hear thy praise, and kisses have, Thou shalt be toss'd from th'bosome to the Grave. But thou for fear thou feel'st thy Masters hand, And thy loose sports should by his reed be scann'd, (Lascivious Book) thou seek'st to mount abroad, Go, fly, but home were yet thy safer road. Ad Cæsarem, Epig. 5. If by chance (Cæsar) thou take up my Books, Lord of the world put by thy morning looks: Thy greatest tryumphs have admitted mirth, Nor need'st thou blush to give my fancy birth, With what aspect thou smilest on Thymele, Or mimicall Latinus, read thou mee. Innocent sports, strict censure may peruse, My life is modest though my lines be loose. Ad Decianum Epig. 9. Because thou follow'st so in thy intents Great Thrasea's, and brave Cato's presidents, That thou maist be secure: nor runn'st thy brest Naked on drawn Swords in a frantick jest, (Decian) thou dost what I would have thee do: I like not him, who to redeem, or wo An empty fame by's easie blood is rais'd, Give me the man that lives and yet is prais'd. De Gemello &amp; Maronilla. Epig. 11. Gemellus seeks old Maronill to wed, Desires it much, is instant, prayes, and fees, Is she so fair? Nought's more ill favoured: What then provokes? O she doth cough and wheeze. De Arria &amp; Pæto. Epig. 14. When Arria to her Pæto gave the sword, Which she in her own bowels first had gor'd, Trust me quoth she, that wound I made, do'nt grieve. But that doth Pætus which thou meanest to give. Ad Julium. 16. Epig. O thou to mee 'mongst my chiefe friends in mind. (Julius) if antient faith, and tyes ought bind, The sixtith Consull present is to thee, And yet thy life knowes small felicitie. Thou dost not well defer thus to denye, And call that only thine that is past by: Cares, and chainpd toyles expect thee, joys nere stay, But fleeting take their leave, and flie away; These with spread armes and with eaeh hand embrace, They oft slide from our bosomes secret'st place. Credit me t'is not wise, I'le live to stay To morrow's lif's too late, live thou to day. In Æliam. Epig. 20. Ælia just four teeth had, if I told right, One Cough ejected two, another two: Now she may cough securely day and night There's nothing left for the third cough to doe. De Porsena &amp; Mucio Scævola. Epig. 22. When the right hand mistaken in the guard Seeking t'assault the king; in fell reward Threw it self in the holy flames to dye, Such Cruell wonders the good enemie Could not sustain, but by command anon Snatchd from the flames injoyns him to be gon; That hand which Mucius in contempt was bold To burn, King Porsena could not behold: The failing hand the greater glory found, Had it not err'd, it had been lesse renown'd. Ad Cottam Epig. 24. Cotta th'invitest none, but such with thee Are bath'd, and baths provide thee companie: I wondred long how I escaped thy call: But now I see my naked truth spoil'd all. Ad Sabidum Epig. 33. I do not love the (Sabidus), Nor can I tell thee why: Only my humour happens thus, I doe not fancy thee. De Gellia, Epig. 34. Gellia nere mourns her fathers losse Whiles no one's by to see, But yet her soon commanded tears Flow in societie: ‘To weep for praise is but a feigned moan, ‘He grieves most truly that does grieve alone. Ad Lesbiam, Epig. 35. Lesbia thou sin'st still with an unpimp'd door, And open, and nere cloak'st thy pleasure ore, Thy peepers more than active friends delight, Nor are thy joys in kind if out of sight: But yet the common wench with veil and key Strives to expell the witnesse far away, No chinck doth in a Brothel-house appear, Of vulgar Strumpets learn this modest care, Stews hide this filthinesse: but Lesbia see If this my censure seem too hard to be? I do'nt forbid thee to imploy thy prime, But to be taken Lesbia, there's the crime. Ad Fidentinum, Epig. 39. That Book thou read'st is ours, my Fidentine, But now thou readst so ill, 'tis surely thine. Ad Lividum, Epig. 41. Thou that look'st sowre, &amp; readst unwillingly, Mayst th'envy all men! no man envy thee! De Porcia Epig. 43. When Porcia heard her husband Brutus fate, And grief pursued substracted armes to take, Know ye not yet death cannot be denyed? Quoth she, this proof enough my father tried This sayd, she drank the burning Coals in ire, Go now vexatious Crowd your sword retyre. Ad Hedylam Epig. 47. When thou sayst I hasten to't, Doe it if thou meanst to do't; Hedyla, delayd desire Soon languishes and doth expire. Command me to expect, then I Withheld shall run more speedily, But Hedyla if thou dost hast, Tell me that I not come too fast. Ad Fuscum Epig. 55. If any room (my Fuscus) yet there be Voyd in thy Love; for here and there we see Thy freinds abound, one place I doe implore, Nor me reject because unknown before, Thy antientest familiars were as new, When first thy parts their apt affection drew, O let my later love this boon obtain, To be embraced in the elder strain. Ad Frontonem, Epig. 56. Wouldst know thy Marcus wish here in a word? (Fronto) thou great renown of Gown and Sword, Tis to be master of a little Field, His own, course pleasures him such pleasures yeeld. Every man courts the walks of Spartan stone, And wearies his how dey' simply till noone: He that enjoyes his happy grove and land, Before whose fire the loaded Nets spread stand, And leaping fish hangs with a trembling line, Drawing sweet hony from red casks for wine? Whose fat made spreads his Table with three legs, And whose unpurchased embers roast his egs, May he hate me that hates this life or this, And live imployd in City Offices. Ad Flaccum, Epig. 58 My Flaccus, if thou needs wouldest crave What wench I would, and would not have? I loath the too too easy field A like with her that nere will yield. A moderation I embrace, And most approve the middle place, I fancy none that wring my gutts, Nor her that in enjoying gluts. De Lævina Epig. 63. Lævina Chast as Sabines were of old Whose face look'd stricter than her husbands, could, Whiles she permits her selfe refresh'd to be Oft in the baths held in communitie, She fell on fire, embraced a lad, and burn'd, Chast she came there, but too much chasd return'd. Ad Somnum Epig. 72. Nævia six Cupps Justina seaven Comprize, Lycas five, Lyde four, and Ida three, Each man his love by healths arithmatize, If none appeare, then Sleep come thou to me Ad Fidentinum Epig. 73. Fidentine dost thou think and seek to be A Poet by my verse in thievery? So Ægle with her bought and Indian bone may seem to have a sound mouth of her own. So painted-faced Lycoris may seem white, Though black as Moores veild in a nat'rall night. For that same cause that thou art Poet call'd, Thou mayst be said bush-haird when thou art bald. Ad Cæcilianum Epig. 74. Scarce on in all the Citty would embrace Thy proffer'd wife (Cæcilian) free to have: But now she guarded, and lock'd up: apace Thy custom comes. O th'art a witty knave! Ad Flaccum Epig. 77. Flaccus thou greatest of my cares to me, The heire of old Antenors familie! Out with these Muses songs, and companie, No Girle among them will bring ought to thee. What seekst of Phœbus? tis Minerva's chest Is full, shee's wise and hoards up all the rest. What can poor Bacchus wreaths give? Pallas tree Weighs down her boughs with superfluitie. Helicon has no more but springs, and bays, The harps of Goddesses and empty praise. With th'Sacred Fountains what hast thou to doe? The Roman Courts more rich, and nearer too. There the chink gingles, but about our chayr And pulpits, Kisses only fill the Ayre. De Manneia's Epig. 84. A puppie licks Manneia's lipps, the sense I grant, a dog may kis.—sir reverence. De Quicinali Epig. 85. Sly Quicinalis cares not much to wed, Yet would partake the off-spring of the bed, But yet what trick? what custom is't he uses? Most certain he his chamber-maids abuses. So stocks his house and feilds: how truly he Is calld the Father of his familie? De Novio Microspico Epig. 87. Novius my neighbour is, and he From out my windows reacht may be, Who will not envy me? and say I'm happy all howers of the day? Who may, enjoy a freind so near? But he's as farr from me, as where Terentian guards Syene's wall, Nor can I feast with him at all, Nor is it granted once to me To hear him, or at least to see, Nor in this City one throughout Lives me more near, or more remote. Well he or I must further move, Who so would Novius neighbour prove: And verily his Inmate be, Must never Novius mean to see. Ad Bassam tribadem Epig. 91. Cause amongst males thou nere was seen to be Nor as unchast no fable feigned thee, But all thy offices discharged were By thy own sex, no man intruding there, I grant thou seem'dst Lucretia to our eye, But (o mistake!) Bassa th'art out ont, fie. Two Twatts commit the fact, and dare it can, Whiles a prodigious lust supplies the man, Th'hast made a riddle worth the Thebane guile, Where no man is, adultery bred the while. Ad Nævolum Causidicum Epig. 98. Still in a crowd of noise thy voyce is heard, And thinkst thy self a Lawyer for thy table, On this account each man that wears a beard May be as wise: lo all men peace! now pratle. Ad Calenum avarum Epig. 100. Thou scarce hadst twenty sesterties in all, Yet wast so bountifull, and liberall, So richly neat (Calenus) that all wee Thy friends did wish thee much more great to be, Jove heard our prayers, and what we then desired, And ere seaven months (I think) were full expired Foure funerals bequeathd thee such a summ: But, thou as if no Legacies had come, But rather hadst bin robd, grewst so in care, So basely hard, that our more sumptuous fare That in a year thou dost provide one time Costs thee no more then th'offal of thy coyn: And we thy seaven old friends are by thee thought Worth but a lead half pound if to be bought, What mischief shall we wish that's worthy thee? Even a thousand times more rich to bee! If this shall happen which we pray it might, Wretched Calenus thou wilt starve out-right. Ad Scævolam Epig. 104. Scævola not as yet dubbd Knight he prays For one ten thousand pounds his stock to raise, How largely would he live! how happilie! The easie gods smil'd and vouchsaf'd it free. Upon this boon his coat was much more bare, His Cloak far worse, his shoos thrice clouted are, His olives were of seaven years vintage standing, One Table serves two meales by his commanding: The course dreggs ofred wine are his chiefe drink, His pease and wench scarce cost one doit I think, Let us appeale to Law, thou cheating Bore, Live, or else to the gods their goods restore. Ad Lucium Julium Epig. 108. Most famous Julius thou sayst oft to mee, Th'art idle, write things for eternitie: Give me such boons I cry, such as of old Horace and Virgil from their Patron hold, Ile strive to raise my cares beyond times date, And snatch my name from fire's consuming hate, The Oxe on barren fields his yoke wiln't beare, A fast soyle tyres, but yet the labour's dear. Ad Uelocem Epig. 111. Uelox complaines my Epigrams are long, whiles he writes none: he sings a shorter song Lib. 2. Epig. 3. Sextus ows nought, nor fears his quarter day, Tis true: he ows most truly that can pay. Ad Decianum, Epig. 5. Let me not live (my Decian) if the day And the whole night I would not with thee stay, But there are two miles that divide our home, Which are made foure to me when I back come. Th'art oft abroad: when not, th'art oft denied, Or with thy causes, or thy self imploy'd. But yet to see thee two miles I will go; But not to see thee, foure don't please me so. De Selio, Epig. 11. (Rufus) if an inquiry's made Why Selius walks so late and sad? Why his dull looks seem to imploy Some dismal chance and malady? Why his foule nose hangs ore his chest? And pulls his hair, and beats his brest. He moans no losse of friend, or brother, His one son's well, and so's the other, And may they live! his wife's in health, His servants safe, and bags of wealth, His Husband-man and Bailiffe too, Have neer purloyn'd ought of his due, What then's the cause that thus he blubberd? Why Selius sups at his own Cup-board. In Posthumum, Epig. 12. What's this that myrrh doth still smel in thy kisse's, And that with thee no other odour is? Tis doubt (my Posthumus) he that doth smel So sweetly alwayes, smels not very well. In Hermum, Epig. 15. Hermus because thou givest thy Cup to none: It is not proudly, but humanely done. De Paulo, Epig. 20. Paulus buyes verse, recites, and owns them all, For what thou buy'st, thou mayst thine truly call. In Posthumum, Epig. 21. Posthumus kisses some must have, And some salute his fist: Thy hand good Posthumus I crave, If I may choose my lift. De eodem, Epig. 22. O Phœbus and ye sisters nine, What shall I do with you? Behold that merry Muse of mine Her Poet will undoe. Posthumus late was wont to kisse With half lips, which I loath, But now my plague redoubled is, He kisses me with both. In Candidum, Epig. 24. If thy crosse fortune send thee some sad fate, I must persist thy pale and squallid mate. If from thy Country thou must banish'd be. Through seas and rocks I still must follow thee. If riches come, will they be free to many? Wilt thou give part? tis much; wilt thou give any? Tis crosses makes thee mine: when they are gone, Candidus will be happy then alone. Ad Gallam, Epig. 25. Galla dares promise, but makes good no ty, If thou still failest? I prethee once deny. Ad Bithynicum, Epig. 26. Cause Nevia coughs, and grieves, breaths thick and short, And drops her spittle on her brest in sport: Do'st think thy self her heire made presently? Th'art out, thy Nævia flatters, will not dye. In Cajum Epig. 30. Twice twenty sesterties I once besought, Which were they given could not much be thought, Cause 'twas my happy and my antient friend I askd, whose cofferd treasures knew no end? He answered: follow suits, thou mayst buy land: I ask no Counsel Cajus, crosse my hand. In Cæcilianium Epig. 37. What's here and there thou dost purloyn, A pregnat sow's papps, a hoggs chine, A woodcock, commons for two men, A whole Jack, half a Barble, then A Lamprey's side, a Pullet's thigh, A Stock-dove boyld in pottage by: When these are hid in greasy clout, And to thy Boy deliverd out To be brought to thy home: we sit An idle crowd without a bit. Restore the feast if any shame there bee, To morrow I have not invited thee. In Linum Epig. 38. Linus dost ask what my field yeilds to mee? Even this profit, that I nere see thee. De codem Linus gives purple and rich scarlet gowns To his notorious and adult'rous woman: If thou wouldst give what her degree becoms? A loose coat would more fitly stock her common. In Candidum Epig. 43. These are thy ????? ????? these are they (Candidus) which thou soundst out night and day. Thy gown is washd in the Calabrian spring, Or of those flocks their fleece to Parma bring. But mine as one that passed the bulls hornes, stares, Or which would scarce be owned by the first haires, Agenor's son's regret countrey sends thee coats, Thou canst not fell my scarlet for three groats. Thou hangst with Indian teeth thy Libian rings, My beechen table's propd with earthen things Thy gold-tipd plates rich barbles do bedight My dish is red with self-look'd Aconite. Thy boyes may with the Ilian lad compare, My hands my Ganymedes most duly are. Of this thy wealth thou nought bestowest on us Thy friends: yet cry'st out ????? Candidus. In Sextum Epig. 44. Whether I've bought a freeze coat or a boy, For three or four times double the pound Troy, Forthwith the us'rer Sextus, which ye know To be my antient neighbour-friend in show, In care, least I should borrow of him, fears And whispers to himself, but by my eares, I to Secundus owe seaven thousand pounds, To Phœbus four, eleven Philetus sounds; Whiles I have not one farthing in my chest: O my conceited friend's ingenious jest! Sextus 'tis hard to give a flat denyal, When thou art askd: much more before the tryal. In Maximum [illeg.] Maximus wouldst be free? tis false, thou'lt not, But if thou wouldst indeed, hence take the plot; Thou shalt: if thou can'st choose to sup abroad: Or if small wine thy thirst can quench or load: If thou can'st scorne poore Cinna's bravery, And with our homely gown contented bee, If thy lust may be calmd for half a sowse, And entring can'st stoop to thy low-roofd house: If thou this power of self and minde canst bring, Thou shalt live freer then the Parthian king. Ad Gallum de ejus uxore Epig. 56. In Lybia thy wife they stigmatize With the foule crime of too much avarice. But they are lyes they tell: she is not wont To take, but give for scouring of her ?. In Zoilum Epig. 58. Zoilus well cloathd, derides my thred-bare gowne, Tis true tis thred-bare Zoilus, but my owne. In Taurum Epig. 64. While now thou'lt Lawyer be, now Rhetorician, And knowst not to make forth thy wishd condition, Peleus, and Priam's, Nestor's age slips by, And it was grown too late for thee to try; Begin: three Rhetoricians dyed one yeare! If thou hast any skill or stomack here? If Schools dislike? Courts swarm with the old trade, And Marsya's self a Lawyer may be made. Fie, out with this delay: how long shall wee Expect? whiles doubting, nothing thou wilt bee. In Saletanum Epig. 65. Why doe we see old Saletan so sad? Is the cause light? thou sayst his wife is dead. O the grand crime of fate! ô the sad chance! Is Secundilla dead? that did advance A thousand sesterties in dowry to thee? O would this hap had neer came to undoe thee! De Fannio Epig. 80. When Fannius should have scaped his Foe, His own hands stopt his breath: And was't not madness I would know, By dying to 'scape death; In Mamercum Epig. 88. Thou nought recit'st, and yet wouldst bee Thought Poet on that score: Be what thou wilt Mamercus free, So thou wilt speak no more. Ad Quinctilianum Epig. 90. O thou great master of the youth of Rome Quinctilian, the glory of the gowne! Pardon though poor, nor struck in yeares, I hast To live, since no man strives to live too fast: Let him delay that's Fathers rents would raise, And fill his house with shapes of antient days, Me fire, and houses please smoakd with their steame, A native sallet, and a living stream, A bond-man serves my turne, an unlearnd wife, A night with sleep, a day without all strife. Lib. 3. Epig. 9. Cinna writes verses against me tis said, He writes not, whose bad verse no man doth read. In Candidum Epig. 26. Candidus has alone fine farmes, gold, coyne, Myrrh, and drinks Cæcuba and Massick wine. Has the sole wisdom, and the only wit, Enjoyes the world alone and all in it. But has he all alone? that I deny: His wife with ours is in community, Ad Gargilianum Epig. 30. No money's payd, yet gratis eat'st my cheare, But when at Rome (Gargilian) what dost there? Whence hast thou house-rent? or whence a coat? How canst thou pay thy wench? whence hast a groat? Though with much reason thou art said to live, Yet how thou dost it none can reason give. Ad Rufinum Epig. 31. I grant thy large spread fields yeild much to thee And to thy Citty houses great farmes bee, The debtors to thy chest are numerous, And golden tables furnish out thy house: Yet doe not scorn, such as inferiour bee; Since other men have greater wealth then thee. In Matriniam Epig. 32. Matrinia asks if I can love A woman that is old: And such a one I doe approve, But thou art dead and cold. I can embrace old Hecub's itch, Or Niobe all one; But not till she's turnd to a bitch, The other to a stone. Qualem puellam velit Epig. 33. I'de rather have the gentile lass, But if she be denyd? The Libertine shall freely pass, And with my fancy side. The hand-maid which excels them both, Comes in the latest place: If that she have in very troth, But an ingenious face? In Pollam Epig. 42. Cause Polla thou dost strive so fine With paint to smooth thy wrinckled groin, Thou daubst thy belly, not thy lips to mee, And peradventure in simplicitie The smaller fault lyes open freely still, That which is hid is thought the greater ill. In Lentinum Epig. 43. Lentinus Counterfeits his youth With Periwigs I trow, But art thou changd so soon in truth, From a Swan to a Crow? Thou canst not all the world deceive, Proserpine knows thee gray: And shee'le make bold without your leave, To take your Cap away. Ad Ligurinum Epig. 45. Whether sacred Phœbus fled (my Ligurine) Thyestes feast? I Know not; we fly thine: Though that thy Table's rich and nobly spread, Yet thy sole talke knocks all th'enjoyment dead. I care not for thy Barbles, Turbots, Plase, Thy Oysters, nor thy Mushrooms, hold thy peace. Ad Tongilianum Epig. 52. Thy house two hundred pounds (Tongilian) cost, Which by a frequent chance of fire was lost: Thy Brief rose ten times more: let me require Was't not thy plot to set thy house on fire? Ad Chloën Epig. 53. I could not freely want thine eyes, Thy praised neck, and hands, and thighs, Thy paps, thy giblets, and thy hips, And least I should quite tyre my lips Thy several parts to minde to call Chloë in short I'de want thee all. In Gelliam Epig. 55. Where ere thou comm'st we think Cosmus goes by, As from crackd viols spices cast their smel: I care not for thy forreign frippery, For at this charge my dog shall smell as well. In Cinnam Epig. 61. What ere thou askdst (Cinna) tis nought said by thee: If it be nothing? nothing I deny thee. In Cotilum. Epig. 63. Cotilus thou art calld a pretty man, I hear, but tell, what is that pretty than? Hee's pretty, that in order curles his haire, Or smells all baulm or Cinnamon most rare. That Nile's loose songs, or Gaditane doth sing, And into various modes his arms doth swing. Hee that in crowds of females wasts the day, And in their ears has somewhat still to say, That reades; then writes new letters here and there, And nicely leanes not on his neighbor's chair: That knowes whom each man loves, that runs through feasts, Blazons Nirpinus great Grand-Fathers crests. What sayst? is this thy pretty man? this tool? He then that's pretty's but a fribling fool. Ad Lauferam. Epig. 72. Thou darest be nought, yet wilt not bathe wtih mee, I know no guilt to ground thy jealousie. Either thy ragged brests hang ugly down, Or being naked, fearst to shew thy own, Else thy torn groin, gapes with a monstrous slit, Or some prodigious thing hangs over it; If none of these? thou art a beauteous tool, If true? thou hast a worse fault, th'art a fool. In Lupercum Epig. 75. Lupercus now thy—has left to stand, Yet thou striv'st madly him up to command. But scallions and lose rochets nought prevail, And heightning meats in operation fayl; Thy wealth begins thy pure cheeks to defile, So venery provok'd lives but awhile. Who can admire enough, the wonder's such, That thy not standing stands thee in so much? Ad Apicium Epig. 80. Apicius nere complains, does no man wrong, Yet the voyce goes, he has a filthy tongue. In Tongilionem Epig. 84. What does thy Strumpet say Tongilion? I doe not mean thy wench, what then? thy tongue. De Galla Epig. 90. My Galla will, and will not buss, My fancy never could; By willing and not willing thus, Suppose what Galla would. In Uetustillam Epig. 93. Thou Uetustill hast liv'd three hundred years, Hast but four teeth in all, and but three hairs, A grashoper's thin waist, an emet's thigh, A brow more wrinkled then old wives gowns bee, Dugs like the webs of spiders, and if Nile Should with thy chops compare her Crocodile, His jawes would seem but streight: the frogs that bee Bred at Ravenna croke better then thee, The Adrian gnats sing sweeter, birds of night Blinded in morning beames equall thy sight, Thou smellst all hee-goat, hast a rump as fine As the extream end, of a lean duck's chine: The bony tout out-vyes th'old Cinnick quite, When she the bath-man with extinguish'd light Admits among the bustuary sluts, When August brings a winter to thy guts, Nor yet can thaw thee with a pestilence, After two hundred deaths, darest thou commence Bride still? and seek a husband in thy dust To raise an itch? what though he harrow must A stone? who'le call thee wife, or ought that's so? Whom thy last mate, call'd grandam long ago: And if thou askst thy carkase scratchd to bee, Lame Coricles shall make thy bed for thee; He that alone becomes thy bridal cheare, The burner of dead bodies best can beare A taper at thy nuptials, torches can Best enter at the Salli-port of man. In Nævolum Epig. 95. Nævolus nere salutes first, but replies, Which the taught crow, himself seldome denies. Why dost expect this from mee Nævolus? Since thou art not more great nor good then us? Both Cæsars have rewarded my due praise, And me to th'priv'ledg of three sons did raise, I'me read by every mouth, known through the town, And before death receive my quick renown, And this is worth your note I'me Tribune too, And sit where that Oceanus caps you; How many by great Cæsar's grant are made Free denizons because by me twas prayd? The number far exceeds thy family, But thou art buggred Nævolus, feedst high, Now now thou over-comst me sheere, thus, thus, Thou art my betters, Salve Nævolus. Ad Cerdonem Epig. 99. Why art offended (Cerdo) with my book? Thy life, and not thy person's by me strook, Then suffer harmless-wit, why is't not due For me to sport? when stabbing's free to you? Lib. 4. De Natali Domitiani Epig. 1. This is great Cæsar's day, and far above That wherein Ide produced mighty Jove. Mayst thou come long! and and Nestor's years fullfill, And with this, or a better face, shine still. May he adore his Sea-god in rich gold, And let his hands great Jove's tree still infold! May he enjoy the Serpent-ages long, Such as Terentus consecrates in song! Tis much we ask, ye Gods, but to us due, And since tis Cæsar, what is much to you? Ad Faustinum Epig. 10. Whiles that thy book is new and rough, and feares To have its undryed page took by the ears, Goe boy, present this small gift to my friend, He that deserves my toys at the first end: Run, but yet let the sponge accompanie The book, for it becomes each gift from mee. Faustinus tis not many blots we say, Can mend my merry flashes, one blot may. In Thaidem Epig. 12. Thais denyes no man: If no shame thence spring? Yet let this shame thee, to deny no-thing. De Nuptiis Pudentis &amp; Claudiæ Epig. 13. Strange, Claudia's married to a friend of mine, O Hymen be thou ready with thy Pine! Thus the rare Cinnamons with the Spicknard joyne: And the Thesean sweets, with massick wine. Nor bettor doe the Elm and Vine embrace, Nor the Lote tree affect the fenny place. Nor yet the Myrtles more Love and desire the shore. Let a perpetual peace surround thy bed, And may their loves with equall fire be fed! May she so love him old, that to him shee, Though old indeed, may not seem so to bee. De Selio Epig. 21. Selius affirnes there are no gods, And that the heavens are voyd: And well he proves what he avers, Whiles he lives undestroyd. De Cleopatra Epig. 22. The virgin danger pass'd, the Bride enraged, Sweet Cleopatra to be disengaged And, scarce mine armes dives in the baths most cleare: But the kind waters soon betrayd her there, For though thus hid her glories did appeare, Like to soft Lillies in a christal grave, Or Roses closed in Gemms no cover have; With that I div'd, and cropd the strugling kisses, Ye glittering streames forbad the other blisses. Ad Fabianum Epig. 24. Lycoris kills up all his wives apace, I would he had my wife in the same chace! Ad Hyppodamum, Epig. 31. Cause thou desirest to be read and named So in my books, as by it to be famed, Let me not live the thing much pleases mee, And in my lines I would insert thee free, But that thy name is so averse to all The Muses, which thy Mother did thee call, Which nor Melpom'ne, nor Poly'mnia may Nor sweet Calliope with Phœbus say. Adopt thee then some grateful name to us, How wretchedly this sounds? Hyppodamus? De Ape electro inclusa, Epig. 32. Shining and yet shut up in th'amber drop, The Bee as clos'd in its own waxe did lye, Of all her labours reaping this the crop: It's credible she fancied thus to dye. Ad Gallum, Epig. 38. Galla deny: love's glutted if the joy At first doe not seem coy: But Galla yet take care least you deny Too long, and fancy dy. Ad Colinum, Epig. 54. O thou to whom tis free to wear Jov's Tree, And with his first leaves honoured to bee, If thou art wise, enjoy thy days repast, Colinus think the present still the last: The fatal Sisters grant no wish'd delay To any, but observe the destin'd day. Wert thou more rich than Crispus, constanter Then Thrasea's self, more free than Melior, Lachesis adds no tow, the spindles be Unwound, the thred's cut by one of three. In Gargillianum, Epig. 56. Cause thou bestow'st vast gifts on aged men, And widdows struck in years, Gargilian, Wouldst have me call thee bountiful for this? Nothing's more base than thou, nought more vile is. Which mayst thy gifts thine ambuscadoes call, So the false hooks indulge the fishes fall, So the sly bayt traps silly beasts and all, Knowst thou not how to give? how to be free? I'le teach thee then Gargilian: give to mee. De vipera electro inclusa, Epig. 59. Whiles up the Viper climbes the weeping boughs, The amber drop the strugling beast ore flowes, Wondring to see himself in rich dew found, The freezing gemm inclosed him quickly round. Boast not then Cleopatra of thy Tombe Since a Snake lyes in a more noble room. De Curiatio, Epig. 60. Ardea in the solstice we desire, And baths the Cleonæan Star doth heat, Bur Curiatius death condemns their sweat, Since in those praised streames he did expire, ‘No place excludes the fates: when death shall come, ‘Sardinia is in the midst of Rome. Ad Quinctum, Epig. 72. Quinctus requires I should give him my books: I have them not, at Tryphon's he may speed: Shall I buy toys (quoth he) with sober looks? And verse? I'me not so mad: nor I indeed. In Zoilum invidum, Epig. 77. I never askd the gods for gold, Content with mean things, and my own, Now povety let me be bold I ask thee pardon to be gone. But what is the cause of this vote for pelf; I would see Zoilus hanging of himself. In Uarum, Epig. 78. Uarus did lately me to supper call, The furniture was rich, the Feast but small: The Table's spread with plate, not meat: they put Much to accost the eyes, nought for the gut. We came to feast our bellies, not our eyes: Pray take away your gold, give us some Pyes. In Afrum, Epig. 79. Now that the sixtieth harvest thou hast known, And that thy face with snow is over-grown Thou runn'st through all the Citty, every seat, And bringst thine Ave in a toylsome sweat, Nor can a man salute a Tribune free, There's never a Consul can be rid of thee. To Cæsar's House thou walkst ten times a day, And talkst of nothing less than Courtiers gay, (Afer) tis bad in Boyes that go to School, Nought's more absurd than an old medling fool. De Bassa, Epig. 88. Thy Bassa's used to place a childe up by her, And calls it her delight her pretty pinck: Yet loves no childe, which thou mayst more admire, What then's the cause? why, Bassa's wont to stinck. Lib. 5. Ad Lectores. Epig. 2. Ye Matrons, Boyes, and Vigins neat, To you my Page I dedicate, Thou whom more shameless sports delight, And naked pleasant wit, invite. Thy fancy to my foure first books: This fifth shall sport with Cæsar's looks. Which great Domitian may be bold, Before his Goddess to unfold. Ad Vulcanum. Epig. 7. As ruines renovate th'Assyrian nests, When twice five ages the sols bird hath spent: So Rome her old decrepitness digests, Dress'd in the visage of her president. Now (Vulcan,) I beseech forget and spare Our greife, w'are Mars and Venus progenie: So thy loose wife shall passe the Lemnian snare, And in chast love affect thee patiently. Ad Regulum de fama Poetarum. Epig. 10. What's this? that fame to living men's denyd. And Readers their own Lines seldom affect? (Regulus) these are tricks of envious pride, The present still for old things to reject. So most ingrate wee seek old Pompey's shades, And praise the tottered fane of Catulus. While Maro liv'd, Ennius whole Rome invades And Homer's age laughd him rediculous. Crowned Menander seldom heard a shout, Corinna her owne Naso knew alone, O my small books nere hasten to goe out, If praise come after death I'le not go on. In Calistratum. Epig. 13. Calistratus I doe confesse I have been poor, and am no lesse, But not obscurely base as yet, Nor a Knight of the lowest seat. But through the world I'me freely read, And as I passe here's he tis said, What dust and ashes give to some, My life affords without a Tombe. But thy house leans on stately props, Thy chests inclose great silver crops, Rich Ægypts glebes thy houshold keep, And Parma sheare thy numerous sheep. Thus what we are we both may see, But what I am thou canst not be, What thou art each plebeian may With thy estate be any day. In Gelliam, Epig. 17. Whiles Gellia cryd up her Fore-fathers House, And our low Knight-hood valued not a lowse, While's she denied all under the Broad Key, A Basket-bearer swept her quite away. De Crispo, Epig. 33. Crispus by will no doit of all his pelf Gave to his wife: whom then? even to himself. In Caussidicum, Epig. 34. A Lawyer's said unknown my Book to flout, But wo be to thee, if I finde thee out. De Erotio, Epig. 35. Ye Parents Fronto and Flaccilla here To you I doe commend my Girle, my Deare, Least pale Erotion tremble at the shades, And the fowl Dog of Hell's prodigious heads, Her age fullfilling just six winters was, Had she but known so many dayes to pass. 'Mongst you old Patrons may she sport and play, And with her lisping tongue my name oft say. May the smooth turf her soft bones hide, and bee O Earth as light to her as she to thee! Quod datur non perire, Epig. 43. A Thief may break thy Chests, and steal thy gold, A fire consume thy Fathers House of old, Debtors detain thy use and principal, Thy sown seed bring thee no increase at all: A crafty Harlot may thy Steward plunder, Thy Ships and goods the rageing Seas sinck under: ‘What's on thy friends bestow'd is above fate: ‘Thy gifts thou still shalt have inviolate. De Thaide &amp; Lecania. Epig. 44. Thais her teeth are black and nought, Lecania's white are grown, But what's the reason; these are bought, The other wears her own. De Philone, Epig. 48. Philo nere sups at home he swears: tis true, For not invited crib must want his due. Ad Labienum, Epig. 50. When (Labiene) by chance I thee did see Sitting alone, I thought thou hadst bin three. The number of thy baldnesse me deceivd, For here and there thy haires I then retreivd, Which a boy's head will hardly well become, Upon thy crown lyes a large vacant room, A floor wherein no hair's observ'd to bee. Yet this December's error yeilds to thee, That when the Emp'ror keeps his solemn day, Thou carry'st three shares of his almes away. Geryon I suppose was such a one, But when thou seest Phillippus Porch, begon, If Hercules shall spy thee th'art undone. In Posthumum, Epig. 53. What thou conferr'st on me I do Remember, and shall think on too. Why therefore doe I hold my tongue? Cause (Posthumus) thou nere hast done. As often as I go to treat Of these thy gifts to them I meet, Tis presently replyd, forbear, He whisperd it into my eare. Two men some things cannot doe well, One person may suffice to tell, And doe this work: if it may please That I shall speak, then hold thy peace. For prethee Posthumus believe Though that thy gifts are great to give, ‘All thanks must perish, and are lost ‘When Authors their own actions boast. Ad Bassum, Epig. 54. My Bassus why? why dost thou write Thyestes Feast? Medea's flight? What hast to doe with Niobe? Or Troys remains Andromache? Deucalion's feat's a theam more fit, Or Phaethon's to share thy wit. Ad Lupum, Epig. 57. Lupus is careful, and of me doth crave To know what Master for his Son to have? I give thee warning all Grammarians shun, And Rhetoricians too: then out upon Tullie's and Uirgill's barren books and name, Leave old Tutilius to enjoy his fame. If he makes verse? expell the Poet streight, But if he fancy Arts of richer weight, Let him turn Fidler, or a Minstrel bee, But if he's dull of ingenuitie? Make him a noble publique Citty Cryer, Or famous Architect that works by squire. Ad Posthumum Epig. 59. To morrow Posthumus, to morrow still Thou sayst thou'lt live: but Posthumus when will That morrow come? how far? where to be found? Is't in the Parthian, or Armenian ground? Or can that morrow Priam's age out-boast? Or Nestor's? tell what will that morrow cost? Thou'lt live to morrow? this days life's too late, Hee's wise that liv'd before the present date. Ad Detractorem, Epig. 91. Though thou dost bark against me still With bitter yelpings of ill will, That fame shall sure thee be denyed In my books to be notified, Though tis desired of old by thee Through the world to be read with mee. For why should men know thou hast bin? Obscurely perish in thy fin. Yet peradventure there may bee In this great Citty two or three A dogs skin that would dain to gnaw, That scab my nails shall never claw. In Marianum, Epig. 92. Who is that Crispulus? (my Marian) That sticks so to thy wife? what is he man? I know not what that prattles in her eare? And leans with his right elboe on her chaire? Through all whose fingers her light ring doe run? Whose smoother legs no rough haire growes upon? Reply'st thou not? he's one thou dost confesse That doth solicite thy wife's businesse. A sharp observant lad, that wears the Proctor Lock'd in his looks, more strict than an old Doctor? How worthy thou deserv'st stage buffets thus? Or to succeed old blind Panniclus? Crispulus doe thy wife's work? he does none; Tis not thy wife's he does, but 'tis thy own. Ad suos ministros, Epig. 65. Callistus fill four cups of muscadine, And in coole snow my boy dissolve the wine. Let my moyst hair grow rich with perfurme sweats, And tyre my brows with rose-bud coronets. The royal tombes commands us live: since they Teach that the very gods themselves decay. Id Pontilianum, Epig. 67. Pontilian nere salutes till after mee: So his farwel will everlasting bee. De origine Bacchi, 73. He that affirmes Jove, Bacchus mother, may Prove Semele his Father the same way. Ad Theodorem, Epig. 74. Why I nere give my books to thee Desiring, and beseeching mee, Dost wonder Theodore? the cause is cleare, That thine to me may not appeare. De Pompeio, Epig. 75. Great Pompey's Sons Europe and Asia both Interr, Lybia himselfe, if any doth? What wonder through the world to see him slain; So great a fall one field could not contain. Ad Quinctum, Epig. 76. (Quinctus) why Lælia married is to thee? Tis only once legitimate to bee. Ad Cinnam, Epig. 77. Oft drinking poyson prepared Mithridate, No venom could his brains intoxicate: So Cinna by bad meales so fixd doth grow, Hunger cannot prevail to starve him now. Ad Æmilianum, Epig. 76. If thou art poor Æmilian? Thou shalt be ever so. For no man now their presents can But on the rich bestow. Lib. 6. Adulatorium Cæsarem, Epig. 4. Most Mighty Cæsar, King of kings, to whom Rome owes so many tryumphs yet to come, So many Temples growing and restored, So many Spectacles, gods, Cities: Lord She yet in debt to thee doth more remain, That she by thee is once made chast again. De Thelesina, Epig. 7. (Faustinus) from the hour the Julian Law Revived, and chastity began to draw By publique Edict into every House, Scarce thirty days have pass'd, Since Thelesine was askd, And ten times over hath bin made a Spouse. She that doth wed so oft, weds not at all: But rather her we may more truly call A meer legitimate Adulteresse: A simple arrant wench offends me lesse De Fabulla, Epig. 12. Fabulla sweares Those new bought hairs Paulus now by her worne, Are all her own, Most truly shown; Prethee is she forsworn? If thou deny, So cannot I. Ad Priscum de Salonino, Epig. 18. Salonine lyes interr'd in Spanish ground, A sweeter shade nere pass'd the Stygian sound. But it's a sin To mourn for him. For since (my Priscus) thou surviving art, He lives yet in his more beloved part. Ad Posthumum Causidicum, Epig. 19. No action of battery, Of murder, or of poyson, I Pursue: but of three Kids bereft I doe accuse my Neighbour's theft. The Judge requires how I it know: Thou tell'st th'Apulian overthrow, The Pontick war, and perjury Of Hannibal's rash cruelty, Scylla and Marius, Mutius wrath, With open mouth, and spead armes both. Now Posthumus I prethee tell At last where I my Kids may smell. In Proculinam, Epig. 22. Because thou joynst (my Proculine) In Marriage with thy Concubine, One that most palpably before Did only love thee as a Whore, Least that the Law thee should distresse, Thou dost not Marry but confesse. In Lesbiam, Epig. 23. Lesbia thou seemst my Thomas to command, As 'twere a finger at thy will to stand: Which though thou temp'st with flatt'ring hands and voice, Thy crosse grain'd face still countermands thy choice. Epitaphium Glauciæ, Epig. 28. The free born Boy of Melior Which being dead, whole Rome mournd for, His dearest Patron's short delight, (Glaucias) interr'd in endlesse night Under this marble Tombe doth ly, The great Flaminian road hard by, Of modest life, and purely chast Accutely witty, and sweet faced, Just twice six Harvests he passd by Scarcely disroab'd of infancy, O Traveller that these dost moan Mayst thou nere weep such of thine own! De eodem, Epig. 29. No Slave of a Plebeian House or kind, But a Lad worthy his Lord's love to finde, Glaucia my Meliar's manumitted Boy Scarce capable his gifts yet to enjoy, This boon with life and form he did partake, None look'd more lovely, none more sweetly spake. ‘Things too much doted on live short: and such Thou wouldst love long, let them not please too much. In Pætum, Epig. 30. If thou hadst sent mee presentlie Six sesterties, when first to mee Thou saydst (my Pætus) take, I give, Ide ow'd there ten score as I live. But now to doe't with this delay When seaven or nine months slipd away, Wouldst have me tell thee what I think? Pætus th'hast clearly lost thy chinck. De Morte Othonis, Epig. 32. Whiles yet Bellona doubts the warlike doom, And softer Otho might have overcome, He stops the costly charge of blood in War, And by his sword fals his own murderer. He liv'd a Cato, more than Cæsar too, Yet dying, how like Otho he did doe? Ad Diadumenum, Epig. 34. Seale me squeez'd kisses (Diadumene) How many? count the Billows of the Sea, Or spread Cockles on th'Ægæan shore, Or wandring Bees in the Cecropian store, Or th'hands and voices in the Theatre When Rome salutes her suddain Emperor: I slight how many courted Lesbia gave Catullus: he that numbers, few would have. In Carinum, Epig. 37. Medall so fine, Short breech'd (Carine) No vain superfluous reliques hast, Yet itchest from the head to th'wast! O wretch what pain Dost thou sustain? I'have no place for't, Yet love the sport? In Lygdum &amp; Lectoriam, Epig. 45. Y'have playd, enough, lascivious cronies wed, No lust is lawfull but in marriage bed, Is this love chast? Lygdus and Lectore joyn? Shee'le prove a worse wife, than a Concubine. In Pomponiam, Epig. 48. Cause the long robe applaudes thine eloquence, Tis not thy self, thy supper strikes the sence. De Thelesino, Epig. 50 Whiles Thelesine embraced his chast friends stil. His gown was short and thred-bare, cold and mean, But since he serv'd foul Gamesters and obscæne Now he buyes Fields, Plate, Tables at his will. Wouldst thou grow rich Bithinicus? live vain: Pure kisses will yield none, or little gain. Ad Luperlum, Epig. 51. Cause thou dost feast so often without mee Luperlus, I have found a plague for thee. Though thou dost importune, and send, and call, I'le shew a seeming anger over all. And when thou sayst, what wilt thou? doe in summ What will I doe? I am resolv'd to come. Epitaphium Pantagathi, Epig. 52. Here lyes interrd cropt in his youthful years Pantagathus, his Masters joy, and tears. Learnd with a flying touch to trim loose hairs. And shave the brisly cheek that roughly stares, O earth lye pleasing! and light on him stand, Thou canst not be more light then was his hand. In Phœbum, Epig. 57. Phœbus belyes with Oyle his fained haires, And ore his scalp a painted border wears: Thou needst no Barber to corect thy pate, Phœbus a spung would better doe the feat. In Invidum, Epig. 61. Rome praises, loves, and sings my merry leaves, Me every bosom, every hand receives. One blushes, one growes pale, and one disdains, One stands amazd, one hates me for my pains: This was my great desire, my wishd increas, Now now my verses, now my verses please. Ad Marianum, Epig. 63. Thou knowst thy self entrapd, and art aware How coveteous he was that layd the snare. And (Marian) needs must know his second care; Yet notwithstanding dost make him thine heir, And headily wouldst have him to succeed Thee in thy goods and lands by thy last Deed. Tis true he sent rich gifts, but layd in wire, And can the Fish their murderer desire? Or will he (Marian) truly weep for thee? To have true tears, reverse thy Legacie. De præcone Puellam vendente, Epig. 66. Gællian the Cryer brought a Lass To market, of smale fame to pass, Such as in Baudy-houses sate: Whiles she stood long at a smale rate, He to approve her sound and good Drew her near to him as she stood, And kissd her three or four times ore But wouldst thou know what fruit these bore? Why he that bad six hundred pieces for her Upon this score did utterly abhor her. Ad Pannieum de Gellia uxore, Epig. 67. Pannicus dost desire to know Why thy Gellia keeps I trow Eunuches only with her still? Tis thy cunning Gellia's will, To have the secret active sport, Yet feel no throws nor anguish for't. Ad Martianum, Epig. 70. Cotta has livd full sixty years and more, And yet (my Martian) never felt the sore Affliction of a Feaver one short 'bout; Thence though unchastly holds his finger out Against Alcontis, Dacus, Symmachus, But if our years were well computed thus, And what sharp Feavers have took from us, what Languishing grief, and sicknesse, we are not Less then divided from the happier day, We are but Boys in years and yet seem gray. He that conceives (my Martian) Priam's age, Or Nestor's to be long on the worlds stage, Is much deceived, much out: for I thee tell To be, is not call'd life, but to be well. De Cilice Fure, Epig. 72. Cilix a knave of noted theft, Resolv'd to rob a Garden by: But there was nought (Fabullus) left But a huge Marble-dyetie. Yet least his empty hand should miss its prey, Cilix presumed to steal the god away. Ad Lupum, Epig. 79. How? Sad and rich? Beware least fortune catch Thee Lupus, then she'le call thee thanklesse wretch. In mortem Rufi Camonii Epig. 85. In th'absence (Rufus) my sixth Booke is out, But thou her Reader she doth sadly doubt, Base Capadocia by a fate unjust Gives to thy friends thy bones, to thee thy dust. Widdowd Bononia bathe friend in tears, While that Æmilia thy griefs eccho beares, How Pious? but how short lived did he fall? Five bare Olimpiads he had seen in all. Rufus thou that wast wont to bear in minde Out sports, and them in memory to finde Accept this sad verse which I send, As the sweet incense of thy absent friend. De Thaide, Epig. 93. Thais smells as ill as doth a Fullers vate That long hath steepd, broke in the street of late: The tyred Goats not more ranck, the breath and breech Of Lyons, nor stripd Dogs-skins in a ditch; Nor adle egg that putrifying lyes, Nor pot of rotten fish that stinking dyes. That she may change this plague for some sweet scent, Naked and oft she doth the Baths frequent, And shines with Oyle, lyes in sharp fennell hid, Or in bean meale twice or thrice covered. When safe by thousand slights her self she thinks, When all's done, Thais still all Thais stinks. Lib. 7. De reditu Domitiani, Epig. 7. Now sport, if ere, ye Muses with my vein, From the north world the god returnes again. December first brings forth the peoples vote, Tis just we cry, He comes, with open throat. Blest in thy chance, from Janus share the day Since what he'd give, thou givest to us, our joy. Let the crownd Souldier play his solemn sport, While he attends the bayes invested Court Tis right (great Cæsar) our light jokes to heare, Since that thy Tryumph them doth love and beare. De Casselio, Epig. 8. When sixty years Casselius has liv'd meet, He's witty: when will he be cald discreet? Ad Faustinum, Epig. 11. (Faustinus) to let Cæsar read my booke With that same face he on my spots doth look. As my Page hurts no one it justly hates, I like no glory gain'd at blushrng rates. What does it profit me? if others whet Their spleen in my stile? and Jambiques sweat? And in my name their viprous poyson vent? Which cannot brook the day? or orient? We blameless sport. Thou know'st it well, I swear By Helicon, and every Genius there; And by thy ears as dieties to mee, Reader, I'me from inhumane envy free. Ad Regulum, Epig. 15. I have no money (Regulus) at home, Only thy gifts to sell, wilt thou buy some? In Gallum, Epig. 17. When th'hast a face of which no woman may And body without blur, have ought to say, Why suitors thee so seldom doe repeat And seek, dost wonder Galla? the fault's great, As oft as thou and I in the worke joynd, Thy lips were silent, but thou prat'st behinde. Heavens grant that thou wouldst speak, but bridle that, I'me angry with thy tatling Twit com Twat. I'de rather hear thee fart: for Symmachus Says that's a means of laughter unto us. But who can smile to hear the foolish smack Of thy loose Toul? and when it gives a crack Whose minde and mettle will not fall? at least Speak somthing that may usher in a jest Of thy C?'s noise: but if thou art so mute, Articulately learn thence to dispute. De natali Lucani, ad Pollam, Epig. 20 This is the day known by its mighty birth Which Lucane gave to thee, and to the Earth O cruel Prince! more cursd in no decree, This at least was not lawfull unto thee. In Malum Poetam. Epig. 24. When thou dost write sweet Epigrams alway, Which look more smooth than painted features may, Without one grane of salt, or dropp of gall, O mad man wouldst thou have them read at al? Meat does not please without it's vinegar, Nor faces which in mirth nere wrinckled are, Give luscious Figs and Pomes to Boyes: but mine That please, are Figs that rellish Salt and Wine. In Cæliam, Epig. 29. To Parthians, Germans, Dacians thou art spread, In Cappidocians and Cilicians bed. From Memphis comes a whipster unto thee, And a Black Indian from the red Sea; Nor dost thou fly the circumcised Jew, Nor can the Muscovite once passe by you; Why being a Roman lasse dost do thus? tell, Is't cause no Roman-knack can please so well? De Cælio, Epig. 38. When various walks, and dayes in wandring on, And pride, and great mens salutation, Cælius could not endure, and bear about, He feign'd himself tormented with the gout, Which while he strove to personate too much, In a laborious gate upon his crutch, Binding, and 'noynting his sound feet: O see How much the care and curiositie, And Art of feigned grief, did work and please! Cælius has left dissembling his disease. Ad Licinium Suram, Epig. 46. Licinius! thou crown of learned men! Whose tongue brought back our Grand-fathers agen, Thou art restored, but with how great a fate? Returnd almost from the eternal gate, Our wishes now had loss'd their fear: secure Our tears did weep thy losse as pass'd all cure. But yet the King of death could not sustain Our grief, and sent the fates their threds again. Thou knowst what moan thy false death moved for thee, Enjoy thy self in thy posteritie. Live as thine own surviver, hug thy joy: A life returnd will never loose a day. De Annio, Epig. 47. Annius two hundred Tables has I think, And for those Tables Boyes to fill him drink. The platters fly, And charges run about most fluently. Rich men take to your selves these Feasts and stir, I care not for your walking supper Sir. In umbrem, Epig. 52. The five dayes presents which were given to thee In the Saturnal Feasts thou sendst to mee. Twelve threefoot Tables, and seven tooth pickers, A Sponge, a Napkin, and a Cup with ears, Two Pecks of Beans, of Olives one smal twig, A bottle of course Spanish Wine to swig. Smal Syrian Figs with musty damsins came, And a huge cask of Lybian figs o'th same: Thy gifts were worth scarce five shillings in all, Which to me saild on thy eight Syrians tall. With how much ease mightst thou have sent in short Me five pounds by thy Boy and nere sweat fort. De Cæcilianum, Epig. 58. Without a Bore Cæcilan neere doth feast, (Titus) Cæcilan has a pretty guest. In Cinnamum, Epig. 63. Thou wast a Barber through the Citty known, Though by thy Mistris raised to the gown, Of Knight-hood (Cinnamus) when thou shalt fly The judgment of the Court to Sicily, What Art shall then sustain thy uselesse age? How will thy Fugitive rest foot the stage? Thou canst not be Grammarian, Rhetorician, Fencer, nor Cinick on any condition, Nor yet a Stoick, nor canst sell thy tongue Or thy applause in the Sicilian throng: What then (my Cinnamus) doth yet remain? Why thou must e'en turn shaver once again. In Gargilanum, Epig. 64. Full twenty years (Gargilian) thou hast lost In one suit in three Courts to thy great cost. O mad and wretched! that in strifes dost run Through twenty years, and mayst be overcome? De Labieno, Epig. 65. Fabius left Labian heir to all his store: Yet Labian sayes that he deserved more. Ad Maximum, Epig. 72. Thou hast a house on the Aventine hill, Another where Dianan's worshipped still, In the Patrician street more of them stand, Hence thou beholdst within thine eyes command The widdowed Cybells, thence Vesta with all, There either Jove earth'd in the Capitall. Where shall I meet thee? tell, where wilt appear. ‘He dwels just no where, that dwels every where. In anum deformem, Epig. 74. Wouldst thou be wimbled gratis when thou art A wrinkled wretch deformd in every part? O tis a thing more than ridiculous: To take a man's full sum, and not pay Use? Ad Philomusum, 75. Epig. Cause great ones carry thee themselves to please To Feasts, to Galleries, and Spectacles, And Coach thee up and down, and bathe with thee As oft as thou jump'st in their company: Nere hug thy self for this, or look proud for't, Th'art not beloved, but onely makest them sport. In Tuccam, Epig. 76. Tucca most earnestly doth look, I should present him with my Book: But that I will not: For I smell My Book he will not read, but sell. Ad Lausam, Epig. 80. (Lausus) just thirty Epigrams in all, My volume thou most truly bad mayst call: But if beside so many good there be, The Book is good enough then credit me. De Eutrapelo, Epig. 82. While that the Barber went to trim And shave Lupercus chops and chin, He was so tedious on the face Another beard grew in the place. Ad Sabellum, Epig. 84. Cause thou dost pen Tetrasticks clean and sweet And some few pretty disticks with smooth feet, I praise but not admire: Tis easie to acquire Short modest Epigrams that pretty look, But it is hard and tough to write a book. In Sextum, Epig. 85. Sextus was wont me to his feasts to call, When I was scarce made known to him at all What have I done so late? so sudenly? That I his old companion am pass'd by? After so many pledges, many years? But I perceive the cause: no gift appears Of beaten silver from me, no light coat, No cloak, fee, or negotiating groat. Sextus invites his gifts, but not his friends. Then cryes his servants bones shall make amends. Epitaphium Urbici Pueri, Epig. 95. My Parents grief I here lye in this Tombe, Who had my birth and name from mighty Rome: Six months I wanted of three years to mee, When my life's thred was cut by destinie. What favour shall age, tongue, or beauty have? Thou that readst this shed some teares on my grave. So he that thou wouldst have thy self survive, Shall longer then decre pit Nestor live. De Milone, Epig. 101. Milo is not at home, but travell'd out, His fields ly barren, but his wife doth sprout: But why's his land so bare? his wife so full? His land has none, his wife has many a pull. Lib. 8. Ad Librum suum, Epig. 1. Thou that art entring the tryumphant Court, Learn with a blushing grace more chast to sport. Strip'd Uenus hence: this is not thy book, Great Cæsar's goddess come, and on me look. Ad Cæsarem Domitianum, Epig. 4. How great a concourse of the world doth bring Their Iô? and make prayers for their king? But this is not alone a humane joy, Cæsar, the gods themselves keep Holy-day. In Cinnam, Epig. 7. Cinna is this to plead? and wisely say Only nine words in ten hours of the day? But with a mighty voyce thou cravest for thee The hour-glass twice two times revers'd to bee, Cinna, how great's thy taciturnitie! Ad Quinctum, Epig. 9. Nine ounces blear-ey'd Hylas would have payd Now dusk he tenders half thy debt delayd: Take his next offer: gain's occasion's short, If he prove blinde, thou wilt have nothing for't. De Basso, Epig. 10. Bassus bought cloaks of the best Tyrian dy, Forbear ten thousand pieces, gaind thereby: But was his bargain so good cheap you'le say? He took it upon trust, or stole't away. Ad Priscum, Epig. 12. Dost ask why I'de not marry a rich wife? I'le not be subject in that double strife. Let matrons to their heads inferior be Else man and wife have no equalitie. De Cinna, Epig. 19. Cinna would seem to need, And so he does indeed. Ad Luciferum, Epig. 21. Phosphor produce the day: why dost delay Our joys? lo, Cæsar comes, produce the day. Rome begs it. What slow Chariot carryes thee? What signe? that thy sweet rayes retarded bee? Take Cyllaron from the Ledæan Star, Castor himself will lend his Horse for war, Why dost rein in the forward eager Sun? Apollo's Courser with their harness on, Aurora waites: but yet the spangled night Will not give room to the more glorious light, Diana longs to see the Ausonian king, Come Cæsar, though in night, thy presence bring: For though the Stars their revolution stay, Thee coming we shall never want a day. Ad Cæsarem Domitianum, Epig. 24. If I in fear chance to petition thee, If I'me not impudent, vouchsafe it mee. If thou'lt not grant, daign to be askd in love, Incense and Prayers ne're offended Jove. ‘He that an Image frames in gold or stone, ‘Makes not a god, he that kneels, makes it one. In Oppianum, Epig. 25. Oppiane thou only once didst come to see Me very sick: I'le oftner visit thee. Ad Gaurum, Epig. 27. Gaurus he that doth gifts bestow On thee both rich and old, If thou art wise thou needs must know Hee'd have thee dead and cold. In pessimos Conjuges, Epig. 35. When that yee are so like in life An extream wicked man and wife, I wonder how you live in strife. Ad Priapum, Epig. 40. No Guardian of a Garden, or vine bud, But (my Priapus) of a mighty wood, From whence th'art born, and again born mayst bee, I charge thee keep all thievish hands from me. Preserve thy Masters grove for firing too, For if that faile, we shall finde wood in you. Ad Faustinum, Epig. 41. Sad Athenagoras us no presents sent Which in the winter he did still present: I'le see (Faustinus) if he be so sad, I'm sure he me hath truly sorry made. Ad Cestum Puerum, Epig. 46. How sweet's thy vertue, and thy shape to us? Cestus my Boy, chast as Hippolitus! Diana's self may teach, and swim with thee, More wish'd then Phrygus by old Cybele. Thou mayst succeed Ganymede in his place, And unsuspected Smug the Thund'rer's face. O happy she shall climbe thy tender bed! And make thee man first for a maiden head! In variè se tondentem, Epig. 47. Part of thy hair is shorn, part shaved to thee, Part pull'd: who'le think it but one head to be. De Aspro, Epig. 49. Blinde Asper loves a lass that beauteous is, Yet as it seems he loves more than he sees. Ad Cæsarem Domitianum, Epig. 54. Though thou givest great boons oft, and wilt give more O King of Kings, and thy self's Conquerour! The people love thee not cause they partake Thy Blessings: But thy Blessings for thy sake. Ad Flaccum, Epig. 56. When to our age times may subscribe of yore, And Rome's encreased great with her Emperour, Dost wonder Maro's fancy wanting is? And none sound wars like that brave Trump of his? Let patrons (Flaccus) Poets soon will bee, Thy Country shall yield Uirgil unto thee. When near Cremona Tytirus did weep His wretched acres, and loss'd flock of sheep The royal Tuscan smiled: Fell poverty Repuls'd, and by command away to fly: Bad him be rich, and best of Poets bee, And cryed my sweet Alexis love with mee. He that most amiable did waiting stand Filling black falerne wine with snowy hand, And tasted cups gave to his rosie lip, Which might solicite Jove himselfe to sip. Course Galatea from the Poet drops, And Sun-burnt Thestilis in harvest crops. Forthwith he fancied Rome, arms, and the Prince: Which the poor Gnat mournd but a moment since. What should I quote the Uari? Marsi? and The glorious names of Poets rich in land? Which to recfunt would be a tedious pain? Shall I then be thy Virgil, if again Thou wilt Mæcenas bounty shew to mee? I'le not thy Virgil, but thy Marsus bee. De Picente, Epig. 57. Old Picens had three teeth which from him come As he sat coughing hard over his Tombe: Which fragments he tooke up into his brest Dropd from his mouth: Then laid his bones to rest. Least that his Heire should not them safely see Interr'd: He did himself the curtesie. Ad Entellum, Epig. 68. Oh that the famed Alcinous garden sees May well prefer (Entellus) thine to his. Least nipping winter peirce the purple grapes, And on the Vines smart Frosts commit their rapes. Thy vintage in a gem inclosed lyes, And the Grape cover'd, not hid from our eyes. So female shapes shine through their Tifanie, And Pibbles in the waters numbred bee, What would not nature free, to wit, impart? When winter's made an Autumn by thy art. In Uacerram, Epig. 69. Thou only dost admire old Poets past, And praisest none but such have writ their last: Hence I beseech (Uacerra) pardon mee, Tis not worth perishing to humor thee. Ad Liberum amicum, Epig. 77. (Liber) thy friends sweet care! worthy to bee Crownd with Rose-buds to all eternitie! Art wise? still let thy hair with unguents flow! While flowry garlands compasse in thy brow! May thy clear glass with falerne wine black prove! And thy soft bed growe warme with softer love! A life thus led, though in its youth resign'd, Is made much longer than it was design'd. In Fabullum, Epig. 79. When wrinckled Beldames thy familiars bee, Or filthy Bauds, or worse if ought you see, When these compagnions thou dost leade a-long Through every Feast with thee, and walke, and throng, (Fabulla) thus compared we needs must say Th'art handsome and dost bear the bell a-way. Lib. 9. Ad Domitianum, Epig. 4. If thou shouldst challenge what is due to thee From heaven, and its creditor wouldst bee; If publique sale should be cryed through the sphæres, And th'gods sell all to satisfy arrears, Atlas will banq'rrupt prove, nor one ounce bee Reserved for Jupiter to treat with thee. What canst thou for the Capitol receive? Or for the honour of the Laurel-wreath? Or what will Juno give thee for her shrine? Pallas I pass, she waits on thee and thine. Alcides, Phœbus, Pollux I slip by And Flavia's Temple neighb'ring on the sky. Cæsar thou must forbear, and trust the heaven: Jove's Chest has not enough to make all even. In Æschylum, Epig. 5. When for two guilders Galla thou might'st swive, And more then so if thou it double give: Æschylus why did she take ten of thee? The feate's not worth it: what? the secresie. In Paullam, Epig. 6. Paulla thou very fain wouldst Priscus wed, I wonder not, tis witty so to doe: But Priseus will not medle with thy bed, And therein he is full as witty too. In amicum Cænipetam, Epig. 15. Dost think this man whom thy Feast makes thy freind A heart of faithfull friendship can pretend? He loves thy brawn thy oysters, but not thee, Let me sup so, he shall be friend to mee. In Afrum, Epig. 26. As oft as we thy Hyllus doe behold Filling thy wine, thy browes doe seem to scold, What crime is't, I would know to view thy Boy? We look upon the gods, the stars, the day, Shall I fling back as when a Gorgon lyes Steep'd in the cup? and hide my face and eyes? Great Hercules was feirce in crueltie Yet we might see his pretty Hylas free: Nor would great Jove have ought in wrath to say If Mercury with Ganimede did play. (Afer) if then we must not view thy loose Soft ministers that serve thee in thy house, Invite such men as Phineas to bee Thy guests or Oedipus that nere could see. Epitaphium Latini, Epig. 29. The stage his sweet renown, the fame Of playes, Latinus known by name, I here lye seiz'd in deaths cold night, Thy great applause, thy delight. I that could make strict Cato be My joy'd spectator, and at mee The Curii and Fabricii smile And loose their gravity the while. But yet my life nere bore away. Ought from the theatre or play, I only there did act my part Not out of nature, but by art. Nor could I to great Cæsar bee Grateful without my vanitie. Yet Deifi'd Domitian might See that my inward parts were right. But ye may call me at your will A Parasite of Phœbus still, While Rome may know me rais'd above Into the family of Jove. Qualem velit amicam, Epig. 33. I love a Lasse that's apt, and plain doth goe, And with my Boy hath had a bout or two. And her that two-pence makes her mine all ore, And being one can tugg with half a Score, Shee that asks pay, and in bigg straines doth ball, Let her bee drudg to thickskinn'd Burdigal. In Ponticum. Epig. 42. (Ponticus) Cause thou ne're doth swive, But some by-lusts contentment give, And thy more conscious hands supply The service of thy venery: Dost think that this is no offence? (Believe it) it's damn'd excellence Is of so foule and high a weight Thou can'st not reach it in conceipt. Horace but once did doe the feat That he three glorious twins might get, Mars and chast Ilia once did joyn That Rome's great founders they might coyn. All had been loss'd, had either's list, Spent his foule pleasure in his fist. When thus then thou shalt tempted bee Think that Dame nature cryes to thee, That which thy fingers doe destroy O Pontieus it is a Boy. In Gaurum. Epig. 51. Gaurus approves my wit but slenderly, Cause I write verse that please for brevity, But he in twenty volumes drives a trade Of Priam's warrs. O hee's a mighty blade! We give an Elegant young pregnant birth, He makes a dirty Gyant all of earth. In Mamurram. Epig. 60. Mamurra, long and much stalk'd up and down The stalls, where all the goods are fold in Rome, Beholds the boyes, and with them feeds his eyes, Nere prostitute from their first cottages, Such whom the Cages kept in secresie, Close from my cronies and the peoples eye, Thence ful, he calls for the round tables down, And t'have the high placed Ivory open showne, And measuring the Tortoise beds thrice ore, As too small for his Cypress groaned sore. Then smells if purely Corinth the brass scent, And Delian statues give him no content. Complains the crystalls mix'd with Courser glass. Marks myrrhine Cupps, and ten aside doth place, Cheapens old baskets and if any were Wrought cups by noble Mentur's cunning there, And numbers the green Em'ralds layd in gold, Or any from the eares that take their hold, Then seeks true gems in table boards most nice. And of rich pretious Jaspers asks the price. Tyred and departing when the eleventh houre come, He bought two farthing cupps, and carr'd them home. In Æschylum, Epig. 68. I enjoyd a buxsom lass all night with mee, Which none could overcome in venerie. Thousand wayes tyred, I askd that childish thing, Which she did grant at the first motioning, Blushing and laughing I a worse besought, Which she most loose vouchsafed as quick as thought. Yet she was pure, but if she deale with you Shee'l not be so, and thou shalt pay dear too. In Cæcilianum, Epig. 71. O times! ô manners! Tully cry'd of old When Cateline his curs'd plot did unfold, When Cæsar and great Pompey took the field, And civill war with blood the ground did guild. Why dost thou cry ô times, ô manners now? What doth displease (Cæcilian) what cramps you? There's not contest of Princes, no swords rage, But peace and gladness all the world asswage, ‘Tis not our guilt makes the times bad to thee, ‘Thy own (Cæcilian) force them such to bee. In Sutorem, Epig. 74. O thou whose teeth were wont to reach old hides, And gnaw base rotten soles with dirty sides, Thou hast thy Patron's lands now in thy grave, In which I vexe that thou a crib shouldst have, And drunk dost break the christals with burn wine, And frigst thy late Lord's Boy as he were thine. With letters my sad Parents fooled mee, O learning, what have I to doe with thee? Thalia burn thy Books, and thy quills too, If Coblers get such boons from an old shooe. De effigie Camoni, Epig. 77. This which you see is my Camonus face, Such his young looks, such his first beauty was. Thy countenance grew stronger twice ten years Till a beard cream'd his cheeks with downy haires. The offer'd Purple once his shoulders spread, But one of the three Sisters wish'd him dead, And thence his hast'ned thred of life did cut, Which to his Father in a sad Urne put Came from his absent pile: but least alone This Picture should present his beauty gone, His Image yet more sweetly drawn shall be In never dying papers writ by mee. De Gellia, Epig. 81. An old rich wife starv'd Gellius bare and poore Did wed: So she cramm'd him and he cram'd her. Ad Auctum, Epig. 82. My readers and my hearers like my Books, But a quaint Poet sayes th'are not done cleare: I care not much for pleasing of the Cooks, If that my guests affect my slender cheare. In Munnam, Epig. 83. Th'Astrologer fore-told of thee, That thou shouldst perish sudden lie; Nor (Munna) doe I think he told a lye; For thou for fear least there should bee Ought left for thy posteritie, Hast wasted all thy wealth in luxurie, Thy brace of millions in one year was spent, Was not this perishing incontinent? Ad Rufum; Epig. 89. While thou didst seek my love, thou senst mee some Presents, but now thou hast it no gifts come. That thou mayst hold mee (Rufus) still bee free Least th'ill fed Bore break from his franck and flie. Domitiano Adulatorium, Epig. 92. If that a diverse invitation came At once in Jove's and in great Cæsar's name, Though that the Stars were near, Rome more remote, The gods in answer should have this my vote, Go seek an other that Jove's guest would bee, My Jupiter on Earth hath fett'red mee. Lib. 10. Liber ad Lectorem, Epig. 1. If I seem of a tedious length to thee, Read but a few, I will a manual be, My Page in three or four short lines shall cease, ?Mak?e mee as brief as may thy fancy please. Ad eundem, Epig. 2. My tenth Book's care once hast'ned from my hand Is now revok'd againe to be new scann'd, Part hath been publick, but they new smooth'd are, O favour both, the last's the greater share. Reader, these riches when Rome gave to mee, Shee said no greater we can give to thee. By these thou shalt escape oblivion, And live in thy best part when thou art gone. The Fig-tree may Messala's Marble weare, And base Mule-drivers Crispus Statues jeare, No theft can papers hurt, no age thrust by, These Monuments alone can never dye. In maledicum Poetam, Epig. 5. Who so by impious verse in all the Towne Scandals the Senators or Matrons gown, Which rather ought be worshipp'd: Let him bee Bannish'd through all the seats of beggerie. And let him from the Dogs bespeak their meat, Be his December long, his winter wet, Let his shut Vault prolong the frost most sad, And let him cry such happy that are dead On hellish-bedsteads carried to their grave, And when his last threds their fulfilling have, And the slow day shall come, ô let him see Himself the strife of Dogs, and his limbes bee The prey of ravenous Birds, nor let his pains End in the simple crack of his heart's veins, But feeling the strict doom of Æacus, One while let him relieve old Sisyphus, Then scortch in Tantalus his dry desire, And all the fables of the Poets tyre, And when the truth the Furies shall demand, May his false conscience cry this was the hand. De Paulla, Epig. 8. Paulla thou needs would'st marry mee When thou art old and tough: I cannot: yet I'de venture thee Wert thou but old enough. In Calliodorem, Epig. 11. (Calliodore) there's no other talk with thee But Theseus and Perithous: And would'st bee Conceiv'd like Pylades. But let mee dye If thou deserv'st to hold a Mallet by To Pylades, or feed Perithous Swine, Yet thou sayst thou hast serv'd some friends of thine With twice five Millions, and a Coat thrice wore, What? as if sweet Orestes gave no more At any time to his dear friend? why hee That giveth much, not all, doth more denie. Ad Crispum, Epig. 14. Crispus thou say'st thou art best friend to mee, But how you'le make it good I ask let's see? When I desired ten pieces, 'twas denyed, Though that thy Chest could not thy coyne bestride, When didst thou send me one peck of bean meale? When thou didst reap thy fields by fruitfull Nile? In winter frosts when did a short Coat come? Or one half pound of silver in a sum? I see not how thou my familiar art, But that before me thou art wont to fart. In Cajum, Epig. 16. (Cajus) if promises be all thy gifts, I'le overcome thee in thy bounteous shifts. Take all th'Asturian Digs in Spanish fields, And all the Ore that golden Tagus yields, What ere the Indian finds in the Sea weed, And what the Phœnix in her Nest hath hid, Take all great Tyros cloath of richest dy, Take all men have: O how thy gifts doe fly! De M. Antonio, Epig. 23. Happy Antonius in a pleasant age Hath seen fifteen Olympiads on Earth's stage: Looks back on his pass'd dayes and safer years With joy, nor at his near grave shrinks or fears. No day's ingrate or sad to think upon, Nor doth he blush to mention any gone, A good man doubles his life's date: For hee Lives twice, that can his age with comfort see. In Calliodorum, Epig. 31. Thou for three hund'red pence thy man didst sell, (Callidore) that thou might'st but once sup well. Nor didst that neither: For afour pound fish Was the crown of thy feast, and thy chief dish, Pase wretch this is not fish we justly can Exclaim, tis man, thou dost devoure a man. De Imagine M. Antonio ad Cæditianum, Epig. 32. This draught adorn'd with Rose-buds which you see, Whose Picture is't (Cæditian) ask'st thou mee? Such was Mark Antoni in his prime years, When old such was his unchanged look and hairs, O would that Art his minde and parts could draw, A fairer portraicture earth never saw! In Lesbiam, Epig. 39. Lesbia why dost thou swear That thou wast born that year When Brutus was made Consull? tis a lye. Thy Mother brought thee forth her womb When Numa reigned first in Rome, And so again thou dost the truth deny. For thy long dated ages seem to say Thou wast produced from Prometheus clay. Ad Philerotem, Epig. 43. Thy seaventh wife now lyes buried in the field, Thy ground more gain than any mans doth yield. Ad Julium Martialem, Epig. 47. Most pleasant Martial these are they That make the happyer life and day, Means not sweat for, but resign'd, Fire without end, fields still in kinde, No strife, no office, inward peace, Free strength, a body sans disease, A prudent plainesse, equal friends, Cheap Cates, not scraped from the world's ends, A night not drown'd, but free from care, Sheets never sad, and yet chast are, Sleep that makes short the shades of night, Art such thou would'st be, if there might A choice be offer'd, nor dost fear Nor wish thy last dayes exit here. Epitaphium nobilis Matronæ, Epig. 63. Behold these little Marble stones Which veile not to those mighty ones Of Cæsar, nor the Carian pride: Terentus twice my life hath try'd, And twas sincere to my last end. Five Boyes great Juno did me send, And just as many Girles as those Whose hands my dying eyes did close. And this rare glory happ'ned more to mee, One prick was privy to my chastitie. Epitaphium vetulæ. Epig. 67. Here Pyrrha's Daughter, Nestor's Mother in Law, Whom youthful Noibe in gray hairs saw, Whom old Laertes did his Beldame name, Great Priam's Nurse, Thyestes wive's grandam, Surviver to all nine lived Dawes are gone, Old Plotia with her bald Melanthion Lyes itching here at last under this stone. De Phillide, Epig. 81. Two men betimes came Phillida to swive, And strove which of them first the feat should doe, She promised both, to both her self to give, Did it, one stole her gown, th'other her shooe. Ad Cæcilianum, Epig. 84. Dost wonder Afer cannot sleep? dost see What a sweet faced companion hath hee? In Ligellam, Epig. 90. Why dost thou reach thy Merkin now half dust? Why dost provoke the ashes of thy lust? Girles such lasciviousnesse doth best beseem, For thou art pass'd old woman in esteem. That trick (Ligella) suites not, credit mee, With Hecuba, but young Andromache. Thou err'st, if this a C? thou dar'st to call To which no Prick doth now belong at all, If thou cann'st blush Ligella, be afear'd To pull a deceas'd Lyon by the beard. De Numa, Epig. 97. While they the Funeral charge prepare Which in the paper piles placed are, And Numa's weeping wife now buyes Sweet perfumes for his Obsequies, His Grave and Beere being ready made, And one to wash his body dead, And me left Heire by his own Pen, Pox on him! he grew well agen. Lib. 11. Ad Lectores, Epig. 2. Sad looks, and rigid Cato's stricter brow, And course Fabricius Daughter from the plough, Disguised pride, manners by rule put on, And what we are not in the dark, begon. My verses Iô Saturnalia cry, And (Nerva) under thee 'tis liberty. De suis Libellis, Epig. 4. My lines are not alone delighted here, Nor doe I spend them on the idle eare, But by the sowre Centurion they are lost Under his ensignes in the Getick frost. And Brittain's said my verse to sing: But what Can thence accrew? my purse ne're hears of that. What never dying Papers could I write? And glorious wars in a rich strain Indite! Should Heaven Augustus once again revive, And Rome to me a sweet Mæcenas give! Ad Romam, Epig. 7. In Sythe-crown'd Saturn's Feasts, wherein The box of Dice doth reign as King, All-cover'd Rome thou dost permit Me now to sport my fluent wit, So I suppose, for thou did'st smile, Thence we are not forbid the while. Ye pallid cares far hence begon, I'le speak what ere I think upon, Sans any studied delay, So fill me out three cups my Boy, Such as Pithagoras did give To Nero when he here did live, But (Dindymus) fill faster too, For sober I can nothing doe. When I am drunck up to the height Full fifteen Poets seize me streight. Now give me kisses, such as were Catullus his and if they are So numerous as his are said to bee, I will Catullus Sparrow give to thee. Epitaphium Paridis, Epig. 14. Thou that beat'st the Flaminian way Passe not this Noble Tombe but stay, Here Rome's delight, and Nile's salt treasure, Art, Graces, Sport, and sweetest Pleasure, The grief and glory of the Stage, And all the Cupids of the Age, And all the Uenusses lye here Interr'd in Paris Sepulcher. De Libro suo, Epig. 16. I have such papers that grim Cato's wife May read, and strictest Sabines in their life. I will this Book should laugh throughout and jest, And be more wicked than are all the rest, And sweat with wine, and with rich unguents flow, And sport with Boyes, and with the wenches too; Nor by Periphrasis describe that thing That common Parent whence we all doe spring; Which Sacred Numa once a Prick did call. Yet still suppose these verses Saturnal. (O my Apollinaris) this my book Has no dissembled manners, no feign'd look. Ad Lupum, Epig. 19. (Lupus) thou gavest a Farm in Rome to mee, A larger through my loop-hole I can see, But canst thou this a Living call or prove? Which one poor sprig of Rue shades like a Grove? Which one sly Grashopper's wing hides all ore? And which an Ant can in a day devoure? Which with a Rose-leaf may be crown'd, In which a larger herb cannot be found Than a small Pepper-blade that's newly sprung? In which a Cucumer can't lye along? Nor Serpent safely dwell unlesse half seen? The Garden scarce a Cancker-worm can dine, The wood consumed it starves a single Moth, A Mole's my laborer and Plough-man both, A Mushroom cannot blow in't, nor a Rush Smile, nor sweet Violets their heads forth push. A Mouse layes wast the bounds by the Farmer more Is fear'd than was the Caladonian Bore. The Herbage in a Swallow's foot at best Is carryed at a burden to her Nest. Nor can Priapus when hee's but half man'd Without a prick or sickle in it stand. The gathered Crop will scarce a Snails house fill, The Vintage may be housed in a Nut-shell. (Lupus) thou err'dst but in a Prædium, prandium. single letter, For when thou gavest mee this thou hadst done better To have invited mee—to dine with thee. In Gallam, Epig. 20. Galla dost ask why thee I will not take In marriage bonds to joyn with mee? Thou art too eloquent I see. My Prick doth oft a Solæcisme make. In Pædiconem masturbantem, Epig. 23. Cause thou dost kisse thy Boyes soft lips with thy Rough chin, and with strip'd Ganimede dost lye, Who does deny thee this? tis well. At least Frig not thy self with thy lascivious fist, This in light toyes more than the Prick offends, Their fingers hasten and the man up sends, Hence Goatish rancknesse, suddain hairs, a beard Springs forth to wondring Mothers much admired. Nor doe they please by day when in the Bath They wash their skins. Nature divided hath The males: Half to the Girles born to be shown, The other half to men: Use then thy own. In Silam, Epig. 24. Sila's prepared to marry mee On any score what ere it bee. But I shall put by Sila still; Be the condition what it will. Yet when she needs would fasten hold Give me cryd I in ready gold Ten hundred thousand sesterties In dowry: For what can be less? Nor will I swive thee though it bee Our very first nights jollitie. Nor shall my Couch or Pallat lye In common both to thee and I. And when my Hand-maid I embrace Thou shalt not dare to make a face. But if thine too I doe command She shall be sent me out of hand. My wanton Boy my lips most sweet Shall smack though thou art by to see't. It makes no matters whether he My Boy or else thy Eunuch bee. And when thou dost to supper come Thou shall sit in a distant room: That my Mantle take no smutch From thy courser garments touch. And when thy kisses I receive It shall be seldom and with leave. Not as a wife, but cold as shee That may my rivel'd Grandame bee. If thou canst bear such things as these, And nought refuse that I shall please; Sila thou suddainly shalt finde A man to satisfy thy minde. Ad Phillidem, Epig. 30. When thou beginst to raise By thy old hand and wayes My languishing desire to force it come Phillis I'me tortured with thy active thumb. For when thou call'st me thy Dear life, thy pretty eye, Me thinks I scarcely am wound up by thee In ten houres to the height of Venerie. Thou knowst not the true flatterie: Say but once thou wilt give to mee A hundred thousand sesterties in hand, So many Acres of Campanian land, A House, and Boyes, and Wine that's old, Tables, and Cups border'd with gold: No fingers then will needful be to thee, Thus Phillis rub me up, thus tickle mee. In Nestorem, Epig. 33. When thou hast neither Coat, nor Fire, nor Bed That's eat with Wormes, nor Mat with Sedg patch'd up, Nor Boy, nor Man, nor Maid, nor infant head, Nor Lock with thee, nor Key, nor Dog, nor Cup. Yet thou affectest to be call'd and seem Poor, and to have a popular esteem. Thou lyest: Thou soothst thy self with vanity, (Nester) this is not want, but beggery. Ad Fabullam, Epig. 36. Fabullus when thou dost invite Three hundred Strangers to my sight, Dost wonder? and complain? and chide? When thus unknown accompanied? Though call'd I doe not forthwith wait on thee? Me thinks I sup alone, and am not free. In Uxorem, Epig. 44. Caught with my Boyes, at me my wife the Froe Scolds, and cryes out she hath an ars-hole too. How oft hath Juno thus reprov'd loose Jove? Yet he with Ganimede doth act his love. Hercules bent his Boy, layd-by his Bow, Though Megara had hanches too we know. Phœbus was tortured by the flying Wench, Yet the Oebalian Lad those flames did quench. Though much denyed Briseis from him lay Achilles with Patroclus yet did play. Give not male names then to such things as thine, But think thou hast two Twats ô wife of mine. Ad senem Orbum, Epig. 45. Th'art blinde, and rich and under Brutus bore, And dost thou think true friendship now to have? Tis true: But such thou hadst when young and poor, He that comes now, desires thee in thy Grave. In Phillida, Epig. 50. There's not an houre thou dost not plunder mee When thou perceiv'st me mad with love of thee, Phillis thou thiev'st with such calliditie. One while thy cheating Maid weeps for the loss Of some rich Gem, Earing, or Looking-glasse, Which from her hand or eare did slip or passe. Then the Silk-gowns are stolen away shee'le fain. To be recovered at my charge and pain, Or else some Sweet-box must be fill'd again. Another while there is an appetite To a rich Jug of falerne wine that's right To expiate the terrors of the night. Another while a great Jack I must buy, Or else a two pound Barble: some sweet shee Bespeaks a supper at thy cost with thee. Blush then at last, and Phillis let there bee A just respect of truth and equitie, I grudg thee nothing: Nought deny to mee. In Cheræmonem, Epig. 57. Stoick Cheræmon cause that thou Canst cry up death I know not how Thou would'st have me this thy fortitude admire: Some broken Pitcher bred in thee This seeming piece of gallantrie, Or else some frozen Chimney without Fire; A noysom Worm, or Coverlid, Or Side-piece of thy naked Bed, Or a short Coat worn by thee day and night, O what a mighty Man thou'lt seem That canst the Dregs of sower red Wine, And thatch, and poor course black bread dare to slight! But yet suppose thy Couch should bee Stuft with Leuconick wooll for thee, And Purple Vallions should thy Bed attire, And that thy Boy with thee should sleep, Which fill'd rich Wine with rosy lip And set thy love-inflamed guests on fire? O how wouldst thou then wish to see Thrice Nestor's years fullfill'd in thee? And not a minute of a day loss'd have? To slight a life in miserie Is nothing: But he that can bee Contentedly distress'd is truly brave. De Lesbia, Epig. 63. Lesbia swears she doth never gratis sport, Tis true: For when shee's swived she payes well for't. In Uacerram, Epig. 67. Th'art both a Pick-thank, and Detractor, A cunning Cheater, and a Factor, A Lick-twat, and a Fencer too, I wonder much (Uacerra) how now? With all these trades thou canst want mony In Maronem, Epig. 68. Maro you'le give mee nothing while you live But after death you cry then then you'le give: If thou art not indeed turn'd arrant Ass, Thou know'st what I desire to come to pass. De Læda, Epig. 72. Læda complain'd to her old man that shee Was choak'd up in her womb, and swived must bee. But weeps and whines her health's not so much worth, And rather choose to dye than thus hold forth. The poor Man begs her live, her youth run on, And what he could not suffers to be done. Hence male Phisitians come, and female fly, Up goes her heels: O mighty remedy! Ad Pætum, Epig. 77. Pætus thou took'st ten sesterties from mee Cause Bucco loos'd two hundred due to thee, May others crimes I pray nere hurt me! when Two hundred thou canst loose, why not my ten? Ad Pætum, Epig. 80. By ten of clock cause we came but a mile We are accused of tedious sloth the while: Tis not the way's, nor mine, the fault's in thee Pætus, that sent'st thy drowsy Mules for mee. De Spadone &amp; Sene, Epig. 82. An Eunuch and an old man strove to lye With Ægle, but twixt both she still lay dry, One wanted meanes the other strength to frig, So either's labor itbh'd without a Jig. To Uenus then for them and her shee groans, To give the one his youth, th'other his stones. Ad Sosibianum, Epig. 84. Sosibian no man dwells with thee Under thy roofe gratis or free, Unlesse hee's rich or in an Orphans state, No House is let out at a dearer rate. In Parthenopæum, Epig. 87. That thy Doctor may asswage Thy Jawes whose cough doth seem to rage Daily (Parthenopæus) hee Commands that they shall give to thee Life-honny, Kernels, and sweet Cakes, That every Boy unbidden takes. But day by day thy cough growes more on thee, This is no cough (I fear) tis Gluttonie. Epitaphium Canaces, Epig. 92. Sweet Canace lyes buryed in this Tombe, On whom the seaventh Winter just hath come. O mischief! Traveler why dost hast to weep? We must not mourn life shortness now a sleep This kinde of death was worse than death: Her face The Pox consumed, and spoyl'd its tender grace, Those cruel plagues her kisses eate and have, Nor were her lips brought whole to the black Grave. If the hard Fates could not admit of stay, Me thinks they might have come some milder way, But death made hast her pretty tongue to seize, Least her sweet words should meet the Destinies. In Zoilum, Epig. 93. Zoilus he lyed that call'd thee vicious Elf, Thou art not vicious, but Vice it self. De Theodoro, Epig. 94. A fire consumed the Poet's trumperie: Apollo can this please the nine and thee? O the great crime of Heaven! ô sad disaster! Because the House was burnt and not the Master! In Thelesillam, Epig. 98. I can swive four times in a night: But thee Once in four years I cannot occupie. Ad Flaccum, Epig. 101 Flaccus I would not have a Wench so thin Whose armes my litle Rings can compass in. Whose buttock bones would shave, and knee prick harsh, That wears th'Saws in her loyns, Spears in her arss. Nor would I one that's of a thousand weight, I'de have some flesh but not all glory fat, In Lydiam, Epig. 103. Lydia he lyed not that reported has Thou hast a handsom skin but not a face, Tis so whiles silent, and whiles mute you lye, Like Pictures wrought in Wax or Tapestry. But when thou speakst thy skin its grace doth loose, And no tongue more than thine doth thee abuse. Beware least th'Officer thee hear and take, Tis monstrous when an Image goes to speak. Ad Sophronium, Epig. 104. Th'hast so much shamefastness and honestie I wonder how a Father thou couldst bee. In Uxorem, Epig. 105. Sweet heart begon: Or use our wayes with us, I am no Curius, Numa, Tatius. Nights spent in pleasant Cups best please my sense, Thou to drink water cann'st rise and dispence. Thou joy'st in darkness, I by light to sport, Or else by day to loose my Breeches for't. Swathes or Coats cover thee, or obscure stuff, No Wench to me can lye displayd enough. Such kisses please like Doves that are a billing, Thou smackst me like thy Grandam so unwilling, Nor towards the work dost voyce or motion bring, Nor hand: But makest it as some Offering. The Phrygian Boyes in secret spent their Seed As oft as Hector's wife rid on his Steed, Whiles her Sire slept, Penelope though chast Was wont to play her hand below her wast. Thou'lt not be buggerd: Although Gracchus wife Pompey's and others did it without strife. And when the Boy not present was tis said To fill Wine: Juno was Jove's Ganimede, If gravity by day doth thee delight, Lucretia be: I'le have thee Lais by night. Ad Lectorem, Epig. 109. Though thou mayst justly vex at this long Book, Yet for some further distichs thou dost look, But Lupus for his use doth call, And School-boyes for their dinner ball, Then let me goe: Thou holdst thy peace: but tell (Reader) dost thou dissemble too? farwel. Lib. 12. De Ligeia, Epig. 7. If by thy hairs thy age be to be told, Ligeia by thy crown th'art three years old. De Africano, Epig. 10. African has a thousand pound in store, Yet he desires, and hunts, and rakes for more: Fortune hath overmuch bestow'd on some; But plenary content to none doth come. In Posthumum Epig. 12. Whiles in loose Cups thou top'st the night away, Then thou wilt promise any thing to doe, But nothing wilt performe on the next day, Pray (Posthumus) drink in the morning too. Ad Auctum, Epig. 13. Anger's a kinde of gain that rich men know: It costs them less to hate then to bestow. Adulatorium Cæsari, Epig. 15. Whatever shined in the Parrhasian Hall Is to our eyes and to our gods given all, Jupiter stands and wonders to behold Himself in Scythian flames of sparckling gold; Great Cæsar's pleasant pride, and vast expence. These Cups may suit with Jove's magnificence, Such as may well become the Phrygian Boy, Now all with Jove are rich and clad with joy. It shames it shames me to confess of yore How all of us with Jove were very poor. In Lentinum, Epig. 17. Lentinus why dost thou complain and groan That all this while thine Ague is not gone? Hee's carried in a Chair, and bath'd with thee, Eates Mushrooms, Oysters, Sow's paps, and Brawn free, Oft fox'd with Setine, oft with Falerne Wine, Nor Cæcube drinks without its Snow to joyn, Lyes compass'd in with Rose-buds, black with sweets, In a rich purple Bed, soft Down, fine Sheets. When he doth live so well so brave with thee, Wouldst have thy Ague to poor Dama flie? In Thelesinum, Epig. 25. When money without pledg I ask of thee, I have it not thou soon replyst to mee. Yet thou the same man if my field or land Will but pass for me, hast it out of hand. When to thy friend thou wilt not credit give, Thou cann'st my little hils and trees believe. Lo, thou art to be banish'd: Come field prethee, Wouldst have me now? No, let my field go with thee. Ad Julium Martialem, Epig. 34. Julius 'twas foure and thirty year, That thou and I together were. Sweeter dayes were mix'd with soure, But yet the pleasanter were more. And if we should divide the time with a diverse coloured line, The white would over-vie the black. If thou wouldst shun the bitter smack, And stinging tortures of the mind, No man to thee too much bind, Or too much in thy friend believe: Thou shalt joy less, and lesse shalt grieve. In Pontilianum, Epig. 40. When thou dost lye, I seemingly believe, When thou repeatst bad verse, my praise I give, When thou dost sing (Pontilian) I sing out, And when thou dost carouse, I drink about, When thou dost fart, I grunt too in conceipt, And when thou playst at Chesse, I am still beat. Yet thou dost give nothing: dead, you cry I shall be heir: I care not, prethee dye. In Tuccam, Epig. 41. Tis not sufficient that thou drunk hast been, But thou desirest so to be call'd and seen. Ad Phœbum, Epig. 45. Thou that with Leather cap hast covered The naked Temples of thy hair strippd head, How elegantly did he sport and plod, (Phœbus) that verified thy head was shod. In habentem varios Mores, Epig. 47. Thou the same man hard, soft, sweet, bitter art, Nor can I live with thee, nor yet apart. In Lautum Invitatorem, Epig. 48. If Brawn and Mushrooms thou servst up as vile, As though I wish'd them not, know tis my will. If thou conceiv'st me wealthy, and wouldst bee My Heir for five bare Oysters, farwel thee. But yet thy supper's rich, most rich, yet there To day, to morrow, streight nought will appeare, That thy unhappy Maide's base broom know may, Or Dog, or house of Office by the way. Of Barbles, Hares, and Sow's paps this the end, A pale sulpherous look, and gowty friend. Domitian's Feast's not so much worth to me, Nor Jove's, nor can the high Priest's junckets bee. Upon this score should Jove bring Nectar here, It were as dead Wine, or Crab-vineger. Some other guests go seek Sir to your meat, Whom the vast kingdoms of thy chear may cheat. My friend to some short Steaks may me invite, I like that Supper which I can requite. In habentem amœnas ædes, Epig. 50. Thou hast bay Groves, plain, and high Cypress Trees, And Baths for more than one man's privacies. Thy lofty Porch on hundred Pillars joynes, And the spurn'd Onix under thy feet shines. The flying hoofs the dusty race rejoyce, And falls of water each where make a noyse, Thy Courts stretch wide: But yet no place we smell To sup, or sleep. How well thou dost not dwell! De Fabullo, Epig. 51. Why (Aullus) dost thou wonder that Fabullus is so oft snapt by deceipt? I'le give thee satisfaction streight, A good man's still an undergraduate. Ad Semproniam, Epig. 52. He that his brows deck'd with the Muses crowne Whose voyce to guilty men no less was known Sempronia here thy Rufus, here is layd. Whose dust even with thy love still drives a trade, 'Mongst the blest shades thy story he doth bear, And Helen's self thy rape admires to hear, Thou better from thy spoyler didst returne, She though redeem'd did after Troy still burn. Menalaus laughs and hears the Ilian loves, Thy rape old Paris guilt forgives, removes. And when thee those blessed mansions shall receive, No shade greater acquaintance there shall have. Proserpine loves although she cannot see Such rapes, that love shall make her kinde to thee. In Avarum, Epig. 53. When thou hast so much coyn and wealth with thee That seldom Cittizens or Fathers see. Yet are not liberal, but thy heaps hangst ore Like the great Dragon, whom the Bards of yore Feign'd to be keeper of the Scythian Grove, But the base cause of this thy Muck-worm love, Thou brag'st and dost pretend thy Son to bee: Why dost delude us with this foolerie As though we Blocks or Idiots had bin? Thou wast a Father ever to this sin. In Zoilum, Epig. 54. Red haird, black faced, club-footed, and blear-eyed, Zoilus tis much if thou art good beside. In Polycarmum, Epig. 56 Thou ten times in a year art sick or more. This is not thine (my friend) but tis our sore. No sooner well but for thy gifts dost call. Blush: Prethee once be sick for good and all. Ad suum Natalem, Epig. 60. Dear son of Mars, wherein I first did see Great Phœbus rosie-glittering Dietie. If Countrey worship, and green Altars may Displease, cause I at Rome observ'd thy day? Pardon, if there thy Calends slighted bee, And on my Birth-day if I would live free. De Ligurra, Epig. 62. Ligurra thou dost fear that I Verses, and quick sharp Poetry Would spend upon thee, and desirest to bee Thought worthy of that fear conceiv'd on mee, But thou in vain dost tremble and desire, On Bulls the Lybian Lyons their strength tyre, But are not troublesom to Butter flies: Seek then, if thou dost wish thy name should rise, Some poor Pot-poet of the sooty Vault, That with a course Coale, or some putrid Chaulk Writes verses, which are read upon Close-stooles, Thy head shall nere be raised with my tools. De Phillede, Epig. 66. When beauteous Phillis to me all the night, Had gave her self in all garbes of delight, And in the morning I began to sound What gift were best, of Cosmus sweets a pound, Or Niceros his Unguents, or of fine Rich Spanish Wooll eight pound, or Cæsar's coyn Ten yellow boyes: My neck embraced shee, And with as long a kisse alluring mee As marriages of Doves are making up, Phillis desired nought else but a merry Cup. Ad Clientes, Epig. 69. Thou early Client that didst cause mee fly The Citty, some ambitious Courts imply, I am no Lawyer, nor ordaind for strife, But slow, and old, and of a quiet life. Rest, and sweet sleep delight me: Which great Rome Denyed: If I must watch here too, I'le come. Ad Cautullum, Epig. 74. I am thy Heir Cantullus, thou hast said it, But I will not believe it till I read it. De Callistrato, Epig. 82. Least that Callistratus should not Praise worthy men, he praises all; He that thinks no one hath a blot, Whom can he then a good man call? De Umbro, Epig. 83. In winter time and Saturn's holy dayes Umber when poor did me present alwayes With finest Wheat: but now with courser grain, For now hee's rich, and made a man of gain. Ad Charinum, Epig. 91. Charinus cause thou bind'st thy head with wooll, Tis not thy ears that grieve: Tis thy ball'd skull. De Marone, Epig. 92. Maro a Vow did make but somthing lowd For an old Friend, by a feirce Ague bow'd; That if this sickness spared him from the Grave, Great Jove a grateful Sacrifice should have. The Doctors promised certain health: O now Maro makes Vowes to scape the former Vow. Ad Priscum, Epig. 95. Priscus thou oft dost ask what I would bee If I were rich and rais'd to Potencie. Can any man his future soule declare? Suppose thou wert a Lyon: How wouldst stare? In Tuccam, Epig. 96. I penn'd an Epod: Thou beganst to write? Therefore I ceas'd, least thine with mine unite. My Muse to Tragick fancies soard her strain, Thou strov'st to fit the buskin to thy brain. Thence then I touch'd the Harp with learned skill, With new ambition thou pursu'dst mee stil. I Satyrs dared: Thou more exact wouldst bee, I playd light Elegee's, thou ecchod'st mee; What could be less? I Epigrams did frame: And here thou soughtst to rob me of my fame. Say what thou wilt not: Blush all things to bee: And what thou wilt not, Tucca leave to mee. In Bassum, Epig. 99. When thou awife so youthful hast, So rich, so noble, wise, and chast, That the most wicked Goat that is A better cannot wish for his. Thou spendst thy strength with Boyes (we see) Which thy wife's dowry bought for thee, So to his Mistris thy Prick comes Tyred, thus redeemed with mighty summs. Nor will he stand though tempted by The voyce's or thumbs flattery. Blush then, or let the Law unfold it, (Bassus) this is not thine, th'hast sold it. Ad Mattum, Epig. 102. He that denyes himself at home When thou dost knock to see, Dost thou not know his meaning in't? He is a sleep to thee. Ad Milonem, Epig. 103. Th'art wont to sell clothes, incense, pretious stone, Cloaks, pepper, silver, bought away th'are gone: Thy wife's a better chaffer: Though oft sold She never doth forsake thee, or loose hold. Libell. Spect. Epig. 1. In silence Nile thy miracles conceale Nor let great Babylon her cost reveale, May the soft gloryes of Diana's fane Sinck with the Cuckold-god that hornd Jove's name. Nor let the Carian People boast so high Their hanging Monuments twixt earth and sky. Whiles Cæsar's single Piece confines alone Fame and the world to one encomion. In Opera publica Cæsaris, Spect. Epig. 2. Here where that high Coloss the Stars surveys, And lofty engines swell up in the wayes The envied Courts of Nero shined: And one One only house this Citty filld alone. Here where the Amphitheatres vast Pile Is now erected were his Pools ere while. Where we admire the Baths that running gift The proud Field from poor men their dwellings shrift. Where Claudia's Walk extends its ample shade Was the extream part of his Pallace made. Rome's to it self returnd, And by thee they Though once thine Cæsar, are the Peoples joy. De Gentium confluxu &amp; congratulatione, Epig. 3. What Nation's so remote or barbarous That has not some spectator here with us? The Thracian High-shooe from Mount Hæmus comes, And Russians that in bloud pick up their crums, He that sips the first streams of suddain Nile And he that in the utmost Sea doth toyle. Th'Arabian and Sabæans hither beat, And moist Cilicians in their unguents sweat. The Germans with their hair curld in a ring And th'otherwise crisp'd Moores their presence bring. The voyce sounds divers, but the votes agree When Rome's true Father thou art said to bee. Ad Cæsarem quod expulerit delatores, Epig. 4. An envious crue to pleasant rest and peace Which wretched wealth still studyed to increase Are to the Getes exil'd: Nor could the sand Receive the guilty Vagabonds on land. So now the Teazers have That bannishment they gave. The Pick-thank's bannish'd the Ausonian gate, The lifes of Princes from their gifts take date. De Dædalo, Epig. 8. Now Dædalus thou thus art torne By the Lucanian Bear, How dost thou with thy waxen wings Again to cut the Ayre? De sue quæ ex vulnere peperit, Epig. 13. Peircd with a deadly Dart the wounded Mother At one time loos'd one life and gave another. How sure the levell'd Steel the right hand throwes! This was Lucina's arme I doe suppose. Diana's double power she did sustain, When th'Parents was deliverd and yet slain. De Orpheo, Epig. 21. What Thrace on Orpheus Stage was said to see Cæsar the Sand exhibits here to thee. The Rocks have crept, and the strange Wood did move, Such as was once believd th'Hisperian Grove. A mingled troop of all wilde Beasts were there, And ore the Bard a cloud of Birds in th'aire. But he lay torn by the ungrateful Bear As it came feigned thence so twas true here. De Priseo &amp; vero Gladiatoribus, Epig. 29. When Priscus and Uerus did enter the field And their valour proved equall and neither would yield, The people besought that they parted might bee But Cæsar the law of Armes would satisfie. The Law was to cuff it out at fingers end, Thence cherishing Cups and gifts he oft did fend, A conclusion at last this equal strife found, They both box'd alike, and both fell to the ground. Cæsar to both gave rods, both did reward Such guerdons their vertue found that fought so hard This thing hath happ'd (Cæsar) to no Prince but thee, When two men contended both victors should be. Poems. The Publique Faith. Stand off my Masters: Tis your pence a piece, Jason, Medea, and the golden Fleece; What side the line good Sir? Tigris? or Po? Lybia? Japan? Whisk? or Tradinktido? St. Kits? St. Omer? or St. Margaret's Bay? Presto begon? or come aloft? what way? Doublets? or Knap? the Cog? low Dice? or high? By all the hard names in the Letany, Bell, book and candle, and the Pope's great toe I conjure thy account: Devil say no. Nay since I must untruss, gallants look to't Keep your prodigious distance, forty foot, This is that Beast of eyes in th'Revelations, The Basilisk has twisted up three Nations. Ponteus Hixius doxius, full of tricks, The Lottery of the vulgar lunaticks. The Knapsack of the State, the thing you wish, Magog and Gog stewd in a Chaffendish. A bag of spoons and whistles, wherein men May whistle when they see their Plate agen. Thus far his Infancy: His riper age Requires a more misterious folio page. Now that time speaks him perfect, and tis pitie To dandle him longer in a close Committee, The elf dares peep abroad, the pretty foole Can wag without a truckling standing-stoole; Revenge his Mother's infamy, and swear Hee's the fair off-spring of one half-score year; The Heir of the House and hopes, the cry And wonder of the People's misery. Tis true, while as a Puppie it could play For Thimbles, any thing to passe the day. But now the Cub can count, arithmatize, Clinck Masenello with the Duke of Guise; Signe for an Irish purchase, and traduce The Synod from their Doctrine to their Use. Give its Dam suck, and by a hidden way Drink up arreares a tergo mantica. An everlasting Bale, Hell in Trunk-hose, Uncased, the Divel's Don Quixot in prose. The Beast and the false Prophet twined together, The squint-eyed emblem of all sorts of weather. The refuse of that Chaos of the earth Able to give the world a second birth. Affrick avaunt: Thy trifling monsters glance But Sheeps-eyed to this Penal Ignorance. That all the prodigies brought forth before Are but Dame Natures blush left on the score. This strings the Bakers dozen, christens all The cross-legd hours of time since Adam's fall. The publipue faith? why tis a word of kin. A Nephew that dares Cozen any sin. A term of Art, great Behemoth's younger Brother, Old Machiavel, and half a thousand other. Which when subscribed writes Legion, names on Truss, Abaddon, Belzebub, and Incubus. All the Uice Royes of darkness, every spell And Fiend wrap'd in a short Trissillable. But I fore-stall the show. Enter and see, Salute the Door, your Exit shall be free. In brief tis calld Religions ease, or loss, For no one's sufferd here to beare his cross. A Lenten Letany. Composed for a confiding Brother, for the benefit and edification of the faithful Ones.

When Temples lye like batter'd Quarrs, Rich in their ruin'd Sepulchers, When Saints forsake their painted glass To meet their worship as they pass, When Altars grow luxurious with the dye Of humane bloud, Is this the floud Of Christianity? When Kings are cup-boarded like cheese, Sights to be seen for pence a piece, When Dyadems like brokers tyre Are custom'd reliques set to hire When Soverainty and Scepters loose their names Stream'd into words Carv'd out by swords Are these refining flames? When subjects and Religion stir Like Meteors in the Metaphor, When zealous hinting and the yawn Excize our Miniver and Lawn When blue digressions fill the troubled ayre And th'Pulpit's let To every Set That will usurp the chair? Call yee me this the night's farewel When our noon day's as darke as Hell? How can we less than term such lights Ecclesiastick Heteroclites? Bold sons of Adam when in fire you crawle Thus high to bee Perch'd on the tree Remember but the fall. Was it the glory of a King To make him great by suffering? Was there no way to build God's House But rendring of it infamous? If this be then the merry ghostly trade? To work in gall? Pray take it all Good brother of the blade. Call it no more the Reformation According to the new translation, Why will you wrack the common brain With words of an unwonted strain? As plunder? or a phrase in senses cleft? When things more nigh May well supply And call it down right theft. Here all the School-men and Divines Consent, and swear the naked lines Want no expounding or contest, Or Bellarmine to breake a jest. Since then the Heroes of the pen with mee Nere scrue the sense With difference, We all agree agree. A Committee. Cast Knaves my Masters, fortune guide the chance, No packing I beseech you, no by-glance To mingle pairs, but fairly shake the bag, Cheats in their sphæres like subtle spirits wag. Or if you please the Cards run as they will, There is no choice in sin and doing ill. Then happy man by's dole, luck makes the ods, He acts most high that best out-dares the gods. These are that Raw-bon'd Herd of Pharoahs Kine Which eat up all your fatlings, yet look lean. These are the after-claps of bloudy showres Which like the Scots come for your gude and yours The gleaners of the field, where, if a man Escape the sword that milder frying-pan, He leaps into the fire, cramping clawes Of such can speak no English but the cause. Under that foggy term, that Inquisition, Y' are wrack'd at all adventures On suspition. No matter what's the crime, a good estate's Dilinquency enough to ground their hate. Nor shall calm innocence so scape, as not To be made guilty, or at least so thought. And if the spirit once inform, beware, The flesh and world but renegadoes are. Thus once concluded, out the Teazers run All in full cry and speed till Wat's undone. So that a poor Dilinquent fleec'd and torn Seems like a man that's creeping through a horn. Findes a smooth entrance, wide and fit, but when Hee's squeez'd and forc'd up through the smaler end, Hee looks as gaunt and prin, as he that spent A tedious twelve years in an eager Lent. Or bodyes at the Resurection are On wing, just rarifying into ayre. The Emblem of a man, the pitied Case And shape of some sad being once that was. The Type of flesh and bloud, the skeleton And superficies of a thing that's gone. The winter quarter of a life, the tinder And body of a corps squeez'd to a cinder When no more tortures can be thought upon Mercy shall flow into oblivion. Mercyful Hell! thy Judges are but three, Ours multiform, and in pluralitie. Thy calmer censures flow without recal, And in one doom soules see their final all. We travel with expectance: Suffrings here Are but the earnests of a second fear. Thy pains and plagues are infinite, tis true Ours are not only infinite but new. So that the dread of what's to come exceeds The anguish of that part already bleeds. This only difference swells twixt us and you, Hell has the kinder Devils of the two. On the happy Memory of Alderman Hoyle that hang'd himself. All haile fair fruit! may every crab-tree bear Such blosoms, and so lovely every year! Call yee me this the slip? marry 'tis well, Zacheus slip'd to Heaven, the Thief to Hell, But if the Saints thus give's the slip, tis need To look about us to preserve the breed. Th'are of the running game, and thus to post In nooses blancks the reckning with their Host. Here's more than Trussum cordum I suppose That knit this knot, guilt seldom singly goes. A wounded soule close coupled with the sense Of sin payes home its proper recompence. But hark you Sir, if hast can grant the time? See you the danger yet what tis to climbe In Kings prerogatives? things beyond just When Law seems bribed to doom them must be truss'd. But ô I smell your plot strong through your hose, Twas but to cheat the Hang-man of your cloaths, Else your more active hands had fairly stay'd The leasure of a Psalm: Judas has pray'd. But later crimes cannot admit the pause, They run upon effects more than the cause. Yet let me ask one question, why alone? One member of a corporation? Tis clear amongst Divines, bodys and souls As jointly active, so their judgment rowles Concordant in the sentence; why not so In earthly suffrings? States attended goe. But I perceive the knack: Old women say And bee't approv'd, each dog should have his day. Hence sweep the Almanack: Lilly make room, And blanks enough for the new Saints to come, All in Red letters: as their faults have bin Scarlet, so limbe their Anniverse of sin. And to their childrens credits and their wives Be it still said they leap fair for their lives. On Clarinda Praying. As when the early Lark, wak'd by the tears Of sweet Aurora blushing through the sphærs Mounts on her silver wings, and towres the skies To offer up her morning Sacrifice To her great Diety the Sun: and sings The Anthems of her joy to court the springs: So here Clarinda rescued from the night Of soul-contracting slumber, takes her flight Into the azure heavens, and prevents The vulgar sullying of the elements By a most holy hast, and stoops to fly To the great Master of requests on high. No sooner was she bended on her knees But lo a cloud of Angels simpathize, And strive to catch her prayers and convey Her sacred breathings ore the Milky-way. Pardon me (Reader) if I here aver That holy contestation bred by her Amongst those Hierarchies Cælestial Almost engaged them to a Second Fall. But such was the sweet plenty, such the floud Of her rich soul, each Angel had his load: Some charged with a sigh, some with a tear, Each one was busied though not burd'ned there. Yet blessed Saint why why such streams of brine? Sure 'twas for others, for no sin of thine? Those christal beads perhaps dropt for my crimes, Or else in pious charity for the Times? Those sacred gales of grief sufficient bee To waft whole worlds into eternitie. No need of Sailes or Pilot there was here, They knew the channel to the heavenly eare, Only the officious Seraphims to woo A greater glory would be medling too O had but Sodom found in her sad state So dear! so prevalent an advocate! The brimstone of her Judgments had not burn'd, But all her fire had into incense turn'd. Or had these Noah's drunken world forerun, The Ark had kept the woods, nor had the Sun Bin shut up: But the floud-gates of the deep Had lull'd themselves in a perpetual sleep. Smell't you the Phœnix when she dying lyes Raising her issue from her obsequies? Embalm'd in her own ashes? so divine So pretious was the perfume of each line Sayl'd through the rubie Portal of her lips, And now ore the cælestial Ocean trips. Saw you a pearl clos'd in an amber womb? Glowing and sparkling through its courser tombe? So radiantly transparent shin'd her soul, Which she in Holy blasphemy term'd foul, And therefore challeng'd tears to wash that hue And stain of owned guilt she never knew. O Adam hadst thou liv'd thus long to bee Made happy in thy late posteritie? Thou mightst have seen that Innocence again Which thy too slippery hands could not retain! Thus thus she clasp'd her God with pious zeal, With melting Rhetorick, till he vow'd to heal The wounds in Sion: For in her there were No objects for the balm of one poor tear. But least the general works of Providence Should ravish'd stop their courses in suspence: In pitty to the whole Creation, shee Grew silent, least their destiny should bee Scored on her harmless piety. O so Though yet with much regret she let him goe. On Clarinda Singing. As when the Swan, that warbling Prophetess Of her approaching death, begins to ghess The fatal minute near, summons up all The raptures of her soul to guild her fall, Wracking her throat into variety Of different Diapazons sweet as hie, Then sings her Epicedium to that night Of darkness whence she never more takes flight. So my Clarinda sporting with her rare Harmonious Organs fill'd the ravish'd Ayre With soul-transporting notes, as though she meant To breathe the world into astonishment. Had the bright Lady of the flouds bin by She had bin silently content to dy, Finding her self so rivall'd in each strain, But that Clarinda lives to sing again. If ever Artist wrought so high a key To steal a man even from himself away, And winde him up to heaven in a dream Not knowing how, or when, or whence he came? So slipp'd my soul: But thanks dear Soveraign Thou pull'dst me safely down to thee again. Had Thracian Orpheus with his feather'd Quire, And Rendezvouz of brute bin present here The wondring Bard had suffer'd with the rest, Winged amazement, or at least turn'd beast. So winningly did she dissolve the sense In thousand labyrinths of joy, from whence The captiv'd soul could no more hope to see Releasment than time in eternitie. But that that voyce exhaled it from its earth Proved merciful, and gave it second birth. With holy reverence let me dare to say Angels thus cloathe their Halelujah. Thus Mercury to reach Jove's mayden prize Charm'd all the guards and rounds of Argus eyes. Thus Philomel to drown the chirping wood, Melts all her sugard forces to a floud. Thus heaven's high consort bless'd the breaking day When the sweet Baby in a manger lay. The Wisemen, had they heard this sacred strain, Had ventur'd to have offer'd once again, Though neither spice nor myrrh: What then I pray: Even moping gravely to have loss'd their way. For that great constellation of her light Had sunck their lanthorn star in endless night. But yet how sweetly had they stray'd? when shee Makes it no less than heaven where ere she be? O had you seen how the small birds did creep, And dance from bough to bough! then stand and peep Through the green lattice of the trees, to see The instrument of that rich harmonie! And how the active grass there carpeted Contended which should first thrust up its head, And wake th'enammel'd circle of the Bower To hasten forth each pretty drooping flower, That in a radiant Coronet they might meet To weave gay buskins for Clarinda's feet! T'would puzle a strong fancy here to prove Which did exceed their envy or their love. But I shall range no further in dispute, The way to speak her worth is to be mute. For when that voyce clos'd her angelick song, To paraphrase would prove a double wrong. Platonique Love. Begon fantastick whimsey, hence begon. I slight thy dreams, I'me no Camelion. Nor can I feed on Ayry smoaky blisses, Or bayt my strong desire with smiles and kisses, Old Tantalus as well may surfet on The flying streames by contemplation. Give me a minute's heaven with my love, Where I may roule in pleasures far above The idle fancy of the soul's embrace, Where my swift hand may ravish all the grace Of beauties wardrop, where the longing Bride May feast her fill, yet nere be satisfied. Blaspheme not Love with any other name Than an enjoyment kindled from the flame Of panting brests, mix'd in a sweet desire Of somthing more than barely to admire. ‘Though sighs and signes may make the pulses beate, ‘Action's the bellowes that preserve the heat. If all content were placed in the eye, And thoughts compriz'd the whole felicity? Pictures might court each other, &amp; exchange Their white-lime looks, wo hard, and yet seem strange, ‘No, Love requires a quick and home embrace. ‘Nor can it dwell for ever on the face. ‘What ever glories Nature's tender care ‘Compiles to make a piece divinely rare, ‘Th'are but the sweet allurements of the eye ‘Fix'd on a stage to catch the standers by. ‘Or like rich Signes exposed to open sight ‘To tempt the Traveller to stay all night. Yield then (my chast Clarinda) once to see The sweet Mæander of Love's libertie. And seale thy thoughts a grant to understand The welcome pleasures of a wife well mann'd. For all the sweets mistaken in a kiss Are but the empty circumstance of this. So shall a full content wipe out the score Of all our sorrows that have pass'd before. Not a sad sigh shall scape unsatisfied Which in its master's passion wept and dyed. But like a Sea made subject to our Oares Wee'le hoise up Saile and touch the wished Shoares. A Sigh. Fly thou pretty active part To the Mistris of my heart, Shew her how the tedious night Sadly wastes without delight, How my waking soule devides The silent day twixt ebbs and tides Of hope and feare: How Love in mee Knows no measure or degree. Tell her all my feigned dreames Of her enjoyment, which in gleames Of wished bliss I seem'd to see But waking prov'd a fallacie; Contriv'd by death to kill a Swain More than half already slain. Tell her all my secret fears, What a length's in seaven years, And that my grief well understood Is worse by far than widdow-hood. How to see and not partake Is but dying for her sake. Tell her more than I dare say, Yet can think as well as they That feel the freedom of that heat Which I in contemplation beat. And let her know Love more delights In action than in appetites. Tell her burial and a wife Untouched, are both things without life. And that too many heats and cold Will make the best complexion old. And when poor beauty's past its prime The rest is but asleeping time. Tell her all those heights and graces Which are built in female faces Like the Orbes without their motions Are but glorious pittyed notions. And in short without deceit Love cannot for ever wait. Pray her, pray her quickly yield, Uenus joy's to loose the field, And in fetter'd twines to lie Working through love's Misterie. Where in thousand winding wayes She can twist the lover's maze. Where with pleasing losse and pain Ladyes clip and to't again, Mixing fresh with flames half gone, Joyes first felt then thought upon. Tell her if she this deny Love only fed with ayre must dy. Ask her whether groans and charms Mid-night walks and folded armes Be all she meant when first she slew My silly heart at second view? And if a life be spent in wooing Where's the time reserv'd for doing? Now little sigh if she at last Chide and check thee with a cast Of angry looks, like one that comes To kindle love in sullen Tombes? Return to me my pretty dear, And I will hide thee in a tear. Love's Farewell. Fond Love adiew, I loath thy tyranny. Strive now no more to kill me with an eye, Or that we call Thy pastime, but our thrall. I see thy cruelty, and moan the dayes My fetter'd heart lay doting on thy praise. If an unconstant look be all the grace Attends the pleasure of thy wanton chase? I'me none of thine Nor will adore thy shrine. I prize the freedom of a single hour More than the sugar'd tortures of thy power. If floods of brinish tears be all thy drink? And the whol man confined to gaze &amp; think? If groans and sighs Be still thy sacrifice? I'le rather quench the flames of my desire, Then at thine Altar languish and expire. No, I suppos'd thy guilded baytes to bee As reall blisses as they seem'd to mee. But now I finde They captivate the minde, And 'slave the soul to endlesse proofs of joy, Which in the end are pills but to destroy. Wound me no more: I'me tyred with daily dying, Refrain thy dull delayes and bitter trying Of my sad heart Slain by thy dart If this be all my crop of hopes and fears? My love my God shall have, my sins my tears. Free me this once, and when I come to bee The pris'ner of a second miserie. Bring all thy chains And wracks of horrid pains, I'le willingly embrace the dreadful chance, And court my death as a deliverance. Whisper no more there's faith in woman-kinde, Or any fixed thought to strike me blinde. When each new face Their fickle vows unlace. And each strange object that attempts their eye, Bribes all their sense into variety. Give me a heart of such a sollid frame Breathes above changes, and is still the same. I like no wits That flow by antique fits. Nor such a whiffling love whos wandring fire Is guided by a weather-cock desire. Give me a Mistris whose diviner minde Speaks her descended of the heavenly kinde, Whose gloryes are No borrow'd tinsel ware, Let her be yce to all the world, but such As waxe to me that melts upon the touch. Call not that chastity that's proud disdain, Nor plead them honest that in shew refrain, Lust has that trick, And stews such Rhetorick, Only to raise the standard of their price, And steal a verteous paint by seeming nice. No, I abhor those poor religious blindes, Which aime to sequester our eyes &amp; mindes, Love has no mask, Nor can it frown or ask, But in a sweet consent moves every way With its dear object like the Sun and day. No, either love me still or not at all, I like no passions that can rise and fall, No humours please In this conceal'd disease, But if my Mistris strive to catch my will, The Lawrel is attain'd by standing still. Once more I tempt thy pitty (Dearest Love) And if these tears can no compassion move, I'le scorn thee more Than I have lov'd before. And stanck up the salt Conducts of mine eyes To watch thy shame, &amp; weep mine obsequies. Christmas Day; Or the Shutle of an inspired Weaver bolted against the Order of the Church for its Solemnity. Christ-mass? give me my beads: The word implies A plot, by its ingredients Beef and Pyes. A feast Apocryphal, a popish rite Kneaded in dough (beloved) in the night. The night (beloved) that's as much to say (By late translations) not in the day. An annual dark-lanthorn Jubile, Catesby and Uaulx baked in conspiracie, The Hierarchie of Rome, the Triple Crown Confess'd in Triangles, then swallow'd down, With spanish Sack? The eighty eight Armado Newly presented in an Ovenado. O Calvin! now my Cause upon thee fixes, Were ere such dregs mix'd with Geneva sixes? The cloyster'd steaks with salt and pepper lye Like Nunnes with patches in a Monastrie: Prophaneness in a Conclave? nay much more Idolatrie in crust! Babylon's Whore Raked from the grave, and baked by hanches, then Serv'd up in coffins to unholy men Defiled with superstition, like the Gentiles Of old, that worship'd Onions, Roots and Lentiles! Did ever John of Leyden prophecy Of such an Antichrist as pudding-pye? Beloved tis a thing when it appears Enough to set the Saints all by the ears In solving of the text, a doubtfull sin Reformed Churches nere consented in. But hold (my Brethren) while I preach and pray Me thinks the Manna melts and wasts away, I am a man as all you are, have read Of Peter's sheet, how he devoutly fed Without exception, therefore to dispence A little with the worm of conscience. And bend unto the creature, I profess, Zeal and a Pye may joyn both in a mess. The dearest sons may erre, then why a sinner May I not eat? since HUGH eat three to dinner? Good Fryday. What sable Cypress maskes the glorious Sun? Rivalls the world? and robs us of our Noon? What Ague cramps the earth? whereas time fled? Why groan the graves? is nature vanished? Or musty shrivell'd heavens in one dread fire Rowle up in flames? then languish and expire? Some horrid change approaches, some sad guise, Nature, or else the God of nature dyes? Here's more than man in this, more than mankinde, Death's in pursuance, or the world resign'd, No common passion strikes mine eye, no fate Less than the whole's extinction, or debate. Angels stand trembling and amaz'd, the sphears Cease their bless'd harmony, and turn all tears Wrapp'd in a dreadful hush! so highly more Is man's redemption than his birth before! To raise a world from nothing, and divide Dull bodies from the thin and rarified Speaks God in every close: But to renew Those ruin'd attomes when confusion threw The whole into a lumpish mass again, This makes the lovely wonder soveraign. To mould a man in clay, then quicken that Dead body with a soule cooperate, Argues a Reall Presence: But when sin Has soyl'd that heavenly stamp, and chain'd it in The fetters of damnation, to restore That life in death transcends the love before. O then behold and see if ever pain Or anguish match'd that sorrow! when the slain Of God bleeds on the Cross? when heaven descends In bloud, to make man &amp; the heavens friends? Nay more, when man lay doom'd eternally, To answer his own wrath, even God could dye! And smile upon those Wounds, that Spear, that Grave, Which our rebellions merited and gave! This love exceeds all height: yet I confess 'Twas God that did it, how could it be less? Easter Day. How all the guard reliev'd? the Romans fled? Those Basilisks that seeing conquered? Heaven back my faith! what glorious Apparition Shines in the vault? what angel like condition Of Souldiers doe I see? surely my fear Trebles the object, tis the Gardiner. Flow out my tears: Th'have stollen the Lord away, Come view the place whereas his body lay. But yet behold the napkin, and the cloathes Wrapp'd by themselves! in vain you take your Oaths Hard hearted Jews. For ô hee's risen and gone Why stand you gazing? what d'yee dote upon? Peace be unto you. O now I hear his voyce, Run Peter that thy spirit may rejoyce. A greater Star than that out of the East Which led the Wise-men rises in my brest. See where he rides in tryumph! hell &amp; death Dragg'd at his chariot wheells, the powers beneath Made groveling Captives, all their trophies bring Slaves to the lawrels of the glorious King. Nay sin and the dull grave make up the crowd Though base, yet all pris'ners at war allowd. Ride on brave Prince of Souls, enlarge thy bayes Tis thy own work alone to kill &amp; raise, Dying to vanquish death and by thy fall To be the Resurrection of us all. Flow hither all believers, yee that sow In tears, and in a veile but darkly know, Stretch hither the distrustfull hand and feel Th'impressions of the nails and barbed steel. But yet forbear, his word must be attended Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended. However feast your eyes, behold the Star Of Jacob, Israel's deliverer. This boon to begging Moses hee'd not give, But now frail man may See his God and live. Here's extasie of joy enough, that when Our sins conspired with ungodly men To crucifie the Lord of life, and kill His innocency by our doing ill, He yet survives the gall of bitterness, Nor was his soul forsaken in distress, But having led Captivitie in chains He burst the bonds of death, and lives, and reigns, And this revives our souls there's yet agen A Monarchy beyond the reach of men. Holy Thursday. As when the glorious Sun veil'd and disguis'd (As by the shaddowes of the night surpris'd) Disrobes his sable dress, and reasumes The beauty of its splendor from the Tombes And vaults of darkness, mounts the dapled skyes And guilds the heavenly wardrop as he flyes: So here the Majesty of God conceal'd Under a mortal mantle, unreveal'd Till the predestin'd day of its disclose, Sublim'd its earth, and in full lustre rose, Joy'd with the shouts of Angels, and the quire Of Cherubims made happyer to admire. Me thinks I hear the arched sphears resound The Pæans of the Saints, and give them round The tyres of heaven, like claps of thunder rowl'd From pole to pole, and doubled as they fould. Such a diffusive glory, that we see Each Saint triumphant in his victorie. But is he gone for ever from our eyes? Will he no more return? shall we not rise? Or must that cloud that closed him from our sight Stand a partition wal between the light Of his eternal day and our dull shades? O that's a horror kills as it invades! No. There's a hope yet left, a sure record Of mercy undenyable, his Word. Nay more his faithful Promise: I'le not leave You comfortless. And can the Lord deceive? See there his hand and seal: And if you please T'admit the voyce of Angels to encrease An Infant faith? As you have seen him goe So he shall come again: Believe it so. Rejoyce then (ô my soul) that as thou art Rescued from death, and glorified in part, So thy Redeemer lives, and that hee's gone Hence to prepare thy heavenly mansion And when the trembling hearts of them that slew And peirct his pretious body quake to view The terror of his glorious return, When time shall be no more, the heavens burn, Earth crumble into ashes, and the dead Wak'd by th'Archangles voice dissepulcred, And catchd up in the clouds, thy greater bliss Shall meet thy sweet Redeemer with a kiss, And with their eyes his glittering court survey In all the garb of that tryumphant day. Yet so demean thy self in this his dear And pittied absence as if present here. That at his second comming, Sans all grudg He may return thy Saviour as thy judge. Whitsunday. What strange noise strikes mine eare? what suddain sound? As though the rowling windes were all unbound And met at once, by one joynt fury hurld To overturn the hinges of the world? This Scæne fore-runs some dreadfull Act to come, Some greater wonder issuing from the womb Of Providence than what has pass'd our eye? Sure there's no second Son of God to dye? Nor summons to the dead once more to rise And scare the bloudy City's Sacrifice? Nor does the chearfull Sun dance through the sphears As though he meant to fetch his last carrears? Time's not so near its Exit? nor the fall And conflagration of this circled Ball? But yet behold a fire! most contrary To its own nature posting from on high! Kindling a sad suspition, cleft in rayes As though design'd to catch all sorts of waies! Sure tis no wanton flame, such whifling Lights Quench with the night-mark of tempestuous nights, Not daring to attempt the daye's bright eye To judge their non-existent frippery. No, this descends more stayd, reach'd from above, ‘O 'tis the very God of peace and love! But how so strange devided? can there bee Twelve parts like Tribes couch'd in the dietie? That it appears multipartite? in th'dress Of Cloven Tongues? what tongue can this express? Yet though it seems in Sections to appear Most like the soul 'Tis wholly every where. The Spirit's omnipresent, nor can bee Confin'd to number, measure, or degree. But why in fire? and such myrac'lous flame? Fix'd on a stay, yet not consume the same? Are men like Moses bush? can bodyes burn Insensible? and not to ashes turn? The wonder's great! but not so deep as high. ‘Nature must needs leave work, when God stands by. Descend on me Great God! but in such fire May not consume, but kindle my desire. Descend on me in flames! but such as move Winged by th'inspiration of the Dove. Descend in Cloven Tongues! such as dispence No double meanings in a single sense. Hence all you wilde pretenders, you that blaze Like Meteors lapp'd in zeal, and dance the maze Of non-conformity in antique fits, Yea even from your selves curss'd Hereticks; Light not your frighted censors here: no Quaker, Frisker, Baboon, or Antinomian shaker Must fire his brand from hence, the Spirit claims No holder-forth that dwells on second aimes; But Comes t'reprove the worlds Judaick press Of Sin, of Judgment, and of Righteousness. No strange fanatick spark that gaping flyes And leaves its Audience skared with extasies. No Skipper in divinity, no Hinter, No radled Cardinal, no dreaming minter Of words and faces, no Quire of the Brisle, No squib, no squeaker of the puny grisle Approach this glory: For the beauteous Sun Admits no maskers till the day be done. No Chymical St. Martins pass the Test Till the pure Oare's exild, or gone to rest. Shine out bright God, dispel these smoaky foggs Of schisme and heresie that smears and clogs The chariot of thy Gospell, that truth may Break forth in its own glosse and proper ray. That the Blue-apron'd Crackers of the times. Those wilde-fire Rockets, whose ambition climbes To wound the world with broils, set all on fire, And sink a glorious Church through base desire, May dwindle to their bulks, and there indite Long small-drink Anthems of the Saints good night. While it contents the boyes to nod at last November and my L?. Mayors day are past. A short Ejaculation Upon that truly worthy Patron of the Law S?. John Bridgman K?. and Lord Chief Justice of Chester and the Marshes of Wales deceased. Shall all the Tribes of Israel thirty dayes Mourn for the death of Moses? and so raise Their doubled cryes to heaven, and bemoan The Light of Jacob in a Tomb unknown. And Bridgman set obscurely? can the Sun Withdraw its radiant splendor at high noon, And the whole world not stand amaz'd to see Their glory swallow'd in eternitie? Can the bright soul of Justice mount the skyes And we not fear a Deluge from our eyes? Such was thy sad departure, such thy flight Into the spangled heavens, that the night Of a more sad dispaire hath seiz'd our beams, And left us nothing but our brackish streams To offer at thy shrine: And in those showers We state the day, and steep the slow-pac'd hours. Hence let the Law be canoniz'd no better Than a meer corps of words, a bare dead letter, In thee the life departed: In thy dust Lies raked the hand &amp; sense of right and just. What yet survives, or rather what presents It's seeming face cloath'd in thine ornaments, 'Tis but Elias Mantle (though unknown) Dropt to work wonder, but the Prophet's gon. Obsequies On that right Reverend Father in God John Prideaux late Bishop of Worcester deceased. If by the fall of Luminaries wee May safely ghuess the world's Catastrophe? The signes are all fulfill'd, the Tokens flown, (That scarce a man has any of his own) Only the Jewes conversion some doubt bred, But that's confuted now the Doctor's dead. Great Atlas of Religion! since thy fate Proclaims our loss too soon, our tears too late, Where shall the bleeding Church a Champion gain To grasp with Heresie? Or to maintain Her conflict with the Devil? For the ods Runs bias'd six to four against the Gods. Hell lists amain, nay and th'engagement flies With wing'd Zeal through all the Sectaries, That should she soundly into question fall, We were within a Uote of none at all. But can this hap upon a single death? Yes: For thou wert the treasure of our breath. That pious Arch whereon the building stood Which broke, the whole's devolv'd into a floud An inundation that ore-bears the banks And bounds of all religion: If some stancks Shew their emergent heads? Like Seth's famed stone Th'are monuments of thy devotion gone! No wonder then the rambling Spirits stray In thee the body fell, and slipp'd away. Hence 'tis the Pulpit swells with exhalations. Intricate nonsense travel'd from all Nations, Notions refined to doubts, &amp; maxims squeez'd With tedious hick-ups till the sense growes freez'd. If ought shall chance to drop we may call good, Tis thy distinction makes it understood. Thy glorious Sun made ours a perfect day, Our influence took its being from thy ray. Thine was that Gedeon's fleece, when all stood dry, Pearl'd with cælestial dew showr'd from on high. But now thy night is come our shades are spread, And living here we move among the dead. Perhaps an Ignis fatuus now and then Starts up in holes, stincks and goes out agen. Such Kicksee winsee flames shew but how dear Thy great Light's resurrection would be here. A Brother with five loaves and two smal fishes, A table-book of sighs, and looks, and wishes, Startles religion more at one strong doubt, Than what they mean when as the candle's out. But I profane thy ashes (gratious soul) Thy spirit flew too high to truss these foul Gnostick opinions. Thou desired'st to meet, Such tenents that dust stand upon their feet, And beard the Truth with as intens'd a zeal As Saints upon a fast night quilt a meal. Rome never trembled till thy peircing eye Darted her through, and crush'd the mysterie. Thy Revelations made St. John's compleat, Babylon fell indeed, but 'twas thy sweat And oyle perform'd the work: to what we see Foretold in misty types, broke forth in thee. Some shallow lines were drawn, and sconces made By smatterers in the Arts, to drive a trade Of words between us, but that proved no more Than threats in cowing feathers to give ore. Thy fancy laid the Siedg that wrought her fall, Thy batteries commanded round the wall: Not a poor loop-hole error could sneak by, No not the Abbess to the Friery, Though her disguise as close and subtly good As when she wore the Monk's hose for a hood. And if perhaps their French or Spanish wine Had fill'd them full of beads and Bellarmine, That they durst salley, or attempt a guard, O! how thy busy brain would beat &amp; ward? Rally? and reinforce? rout? and relieve? Double reserves? And then an onset give Like marshall'd thunder back'd with flames of fire? Storms mixt with storms? Passion with globes of ire? Yet so well disciplin'd that judgment still Sway'd, and not rash Commissionated will. No, words in thee knew order, time, &amp; place, The instant of a charge, or when to face; When to pursue advantage, where to halt, When to draw off, and where to re-assault. Such sure commands stream'd from thee, that 'twas one With thee to vanquish as to look upon. So that thy ruin'd Foes groveling confesse Thy conquests were their fate and happinesse. Nor was it all thy business here to war With forreign forces: But thy active star Could course a home-bred mist, a native sin, And shew its guilt's degrees how, &amp; wherein; Then sentence and expel it: Thus thy sun An everlasting stage in labour run; So that its motion to the eye of man Waved still in a compleat Meridian. But these are but fair comments of our loss, The glory of a Chruch now on the Cross: The transcript of that beauty once we had Whiles with the lustre of thy presence clad. But thou art gone (Brave Soul) &amp; with thee all The gallantry of Arts Polemical. Nothing remains as Primitive but talk, And that our Priests again in Leather walk. A Flying ministerie of horse and foot, Things that can start a text but nere come to't. Teazers of doctrines, which in long-sleev'd prose Run down a Sermon all upon the nose. These like dull glow-worms twinckle in the night, The frighted Land-skips of an absent light. But thy rich flame's withdrawn, heaven caught thee hence, Thy glories were grown ripe for recompence: And therefore to prevent our weak essaies Th'art crown'd an Angel with cælestial Bayes. And there thy ravish'd Soul meets field and fire, Beauties enough to fill its strong desire. The contemplation of a present God, Perfections in the womb, the very road And Essensies of vertues as they bee Streming and mixing in Eternitie. Whiles we possess our souls but in a veyle, Live earth confined, catch heaven by retaile, Such a dark-lanthorn age, such jealous dayes, Men tread on Snakes, sleep in Bataliaes, Walk like Confessors, hear, but must not say What y bold world dares act, and what it may. Yet here all votes, Commons and Lords agree, The Crosier fell in Laud, the Church in thee. On the death of his Royall Majesty Charles late King of England &amp;c. What went you out to see? a dying King? Nay more, I fear an Angel suffering. But what went you to see? A Prophet slain? Nay that and more, a martyrd Soveraign. Peace to that sacred dust! Great Sir our fears Have left us nothing but obedient tears To court your hearse; &amp; in those pious flouds We live, the poor remainder of our goods. Accept us in these later obsequies The unplundred riches of our hearts and eyes, For in these faithful streams and emanations W' are subjects still beyond all Sequestrations. Here we cry more than Conquerours: malice may Murder estates, but hearts will still obey These as your glory's yet above the reach Of such whose purple lines confusion preach. And now (Dear Sir) vouchsafe us to admire With envey your arrival, and that Quire Of Cherubims and Angels that supply'd Our duties at your tryumphs: where you ride With full cælestial Iôes, and Ovations Rich as the conquest of three ruin'd Nations. But 'twas the heavenly plot that snath'd you hence, To crown your soul with that magnificence And bounden rights of honor, that poor earth Could only wish and strangle in the birth. Such pitied emulation stop'd the blush Of our ambitious shame, non-suited us. For where souls act beyond mortallity Heaven only can performe that Jubilee. We wrastle then no more, but bless your day And mourn the anguish of our sad delay: That since we cannot add, we yet stay here Fettred in clay: Yet longing to appear Spectators of your bliss, that being shown Once more, you may embrace us as your own. Where never envy shall devide us more, Nor Citty tumults, nor the worlds uproar. But an eternal hush, a quiet peace As without end, so still in the increase Shall lull humanity a sleep, and bring Us equal subjects to the heavenly King. Till when I'le turn Recusant, and forswear All Calvin, for there's Purgatory here. An Epitaph. Stay Passenger: Behold and see The widdowed grave of Majestie. Why tremblest thou? Here's that will make All but our stupid souls to shake. Here lies entomb'd the sacred dust Of Peace and Piety, Right and Just. The bloud (O starrest not thou to hear?) Of a King, 'twixt hope and fear Shedd, and hurried hence to bee The miracle of miserie. Add the ills that Rome can boast. Shrift the world in every coast, Mix the fire of earth and seas With humane spleen and practises, To puny the records of time, By one grand Gygantick crime, Then swell it bigger till it squeeze The globe to crooked hams and knees, Here's that shall make it seem to bee But modest Christianitie. The Lawgiver, amongst his own, Sentenc'd by a Law unknown. Voted Monarchy to death By the course Plebeian breath. The Soveraign of all command Suff'ring by a Common hand. A Prince to make the odium more Offer'd at his very door. The head cut off, ô death to see't! In obedience to the feet. And that by Justice you must know, If you have faith to think it so. Wee'le stir no further then this sacred Clay, But let it slumber till the Judgment day. Of all the Kings on earth, 'tis not denyed, Here lies the first that for Religion died. A Survey of the World. The World's a guilded trifle, and the state Of sublunary bliss adulterate. Fame but an empty sound, a painted noise, A wonder that nere looks beyond nine dayes. Honour the tennis-ball of fortune: Though Men wade to it in bloud and overthrow; Which like a box of dice uneven dance Somtimes 'tis one's, somtimes another's chance. Wealth but the hugg'd consumption of that heart That travailes Sea &amp; Land for his own smart. Pleasure a courtly madness, a conceipt That smiles and tickles without worth or weight Whose scatter'd reck'ning when 'tis to be paid Is but repentance lavishly in-layd. The world, fame, honour, wealth, &amp; pleasure then Are the fair wrack and Gemonies of men. Ask but thy Carnall heart if thou shouldst bee Sole Monarch of the worlds great familie, If with the Macedonian Youth there would Not be a corner still reserv'd that could Another earth contain? If so? What is That poor insatiate thing she may call bliss? Question the loaden Gallantry asleep What profit now their Lawrels in the deep Of death's oblivion? What their Triumph was More than the moment it did prance &amp; pass? If then applause move by the vulgar crye, Fame's but a glorious uncertainty. Awake Sejanus, Strafford, Buckingham, Charge the fond favourites of greatest name, What faith is in a Prince's smile, what joy In th'high &amp; Grand Concilio le Roy? Nay Cæsar's self, that march'd his Honours through The bowels of all Kingdoms, made them bow Low to the stirrop of his will and vote, What safety to their Master's life they brought? When in the Senate in his highest pride By two and thirty wounds he fell and dyed? If Height be then most subjected to fate? ‘Honour's the day-spring of a greater hate. Now ask the Grov'ling soul that makes his gold His Idol, his Diana, what a cold Account of happiness can here arise From that ingluvious surfet of his eys? How y? whole man's inslaved to a lean dearth Of all enjoyment for a little earth? How like Prometheus he doth still repair His growing heart to feed the Vultur care. Or like a Spider's envious designes Drawing the threds of death from her own loines. Tort'ring his entrails with thoughts of to morrow, To keep that masse with grief he gain'd with sorrow. If to the clincking pastime in his ears He add the Orphanes cries and widdows tears The musick's far from sweet, and if you sound him Truly, they leave him sadder than they found him. Now touch the Dallying Gallant, he that lyes Angling for babies in his Mistris eyes, Thinks there's no heaven like a bale of dyce Six Horses and a Coach with a device. A cast of Lacquyes, and a Lady-bird, An Oath in fashion, and a guilded Sword, Can smoak Tobacco with a face in frame, And speak perhaps a line of sense to th'same, Can sleep a Sabboath over in his bed, Or if his play book's there will stoop to read, Can kiss its hand, and congey a la mode, And when y? night's approaching bolt abroad, Unless his Honour's worship's rent's not come; So he fals sick, and swears the Carrier home. Else if his rare devotion swell so high To waste an hour-glasse on divinity, Tis but to make the church his stage, thereby To blaze the Taylor in his ribaldry. Ask but the Jay when his distress shall fall Like an arm'd man upon him, where are all The rose-buds of his youth? those atick toyes Wherein hee sported out his pretious dayes? What comfort he collects from Hawk or Hound? Or if amongst his looser hours, he found One of a thousand to redeem that time Perish'd and lost for ever in his prime? Or if he dream'd of an eternal bliss? Hee'le swear God damne him he nere thought of this. But like the Epicure ador'd the day That shin'd, rose up to eat, and drink, and play. Knows that his body was but dust, and dye It once must, so have mercy, and God b'wy. Thus having traverss'd the fond world in brief, The lust of th'eyes, the flesh, and pride of life, Unbiass'd and impartially, we see Tis lighter in the scale than vanitie. What then remains? But that we stil should strive Not to be born to dye, but dye to live. An old Man Courting a young Girle. Come beauteous Nymph, canst thou embrace An aged, wise, majestick grace To mingle with thy youthfull flames? And make thy glories stayd? The Dames Of looser gesture blush to see Thy Lillies cloth'd with gravitie? Thy happier choice? thy gentle Uine With a sober Elm entwine? Seal fair Nymph that lovely tye Shall speak thy honour loud and high. Nym: Cease Grandsire Lover, and forbear To court me with thy Sepulcher, Thy chill December and my May, Thy Evening and my Break of Day Can brook no mixture, no condition, But stand in perfect opposition. Nor can my active heart embrace A shivering Ague in love's chase. Only perhaps the luky tye May make thy forked fortune high. Man: If fretted roofs, and beds of down, And the wonder of the Town, Bended knees, and costly fare, Richest dainties without care, May temptatious motives bee Here they all attend on thee, And to raise thy blisse the more, Swell thy Truncks with pretious Ore, The glittering entrailes of the East To varnish and perfume thy Nest. Nym. I question not Sage Sir but shee That weds your grave obliquitie, Your Tizick, Rhewms, and Soldans face Shall meet with Fretted Roofs apace, I fancy not your bended knees Least bowing you can sprightly rise, Your gold too when you leave to woo Will quickly become Pretious too. And dainty Cates without delight, May glut the day but starve the night. For when thou boasts the Beds of bliss, The man, the man still wanting is. Man. Nay gentle Nymph think not my fire So quench'd, but that the strong desire Of love can wake it, and create New action to cooperate. The sparks of youth are not so gone, But I—ay marry that I can. Come smack mee then me pretty dear, Tast what a lively change is here. Why fly'st thou me?— Nym. —yce yce begon, Clasp me not with thy Frozen Zone. That pale aspect would best become The sad complexion of a Tombe. Think not thy Church-yard look shall moove My spring to be thy Winter's Stove If at the Resurrection wee Shall chance to marry, call on mee By that time I perhaps may ghuess How to bathe and how to dress Thy weeping legs and simpathise With perish'd lungs and wopper eyes; And think thy touchy passion wit, Love disdain and flatter it; And 'midst this costive punishment Raise a politick content. But whiles the Solstice of my years Glories in its highest sphears, Deem not, I will daign to be The Vassal of infirmitie. The skreen of flegmatick old age, Decay'd Methusalem his page. No, give me lively pleasures, such Melt the fancy in the touch; Raise the appetite, and more, Satisfie it ore and ore. Then from the ashes of those fires Kindle fresh and new desires. So Cyprus be the Scæne: Above Venus and the God of love, Knitting true-love-knots in one Merry happy Union. Whiles their feath'red team appears Doves and Sparrows in their gears Flutt'ring ore the jovial-frie Sporting in love's Comœdie. Man. Hold hasty soul, beauty's a flower That may perish in an hour, No disease but can disgrace The trifling blossoms of a face, And nip the heights of those fond toyes That now are doted on with praise. The noon-glory of the Sun To the shades of night must come. May, for all her guilded prime Has its weak and withering time. Not a bud that owes its birth From the teeming-mother earth But excells the fading dress Of a womans loveliness. For when flowers vanish here They may spring another year. But frail beauty when 'tis gone Findes no resurrection. Scorn me then coy Nymph no more, Fly no higher, doe not soare, Those pretty rubies of thy lips Once must know a pale Eclipse. And that plump alluring skin Will be furrow'd deeply in. And those curled locks so bright Time will all besnow with white. Not a glory, not a glance, But must suffer change and chance. Then, though now you'l not contact With me in the marriage Act, Yet perforce chuse, chuse you whether You and I shall Lye together. An Epitaph on his deceased Friend. Here lies the ruin'd Cabinet Of a rich soul more highly set. The drosse and refuse of a minde Too glorious to be here confin'd. Earth for a while bespake his stay Only to bait and so away: So that what here he doted on Was meerly accommodation. Not that his active soul could bee At home, but in eternitie. Yet while he blest us with the rayes Of his short continued daies, Each minute had its weight of worth, Each pregnant hour some Star brought forth. So whiles he travell'd here beneath He liv'd, when others only breathe. For not a sand of time slip'd by Without its action sweet as high. So good, so peacable, so blest, Angels alone can speak the rest. Mount Ida, or, Beauties Contest. Three regent Goddesses they fell at odds, As they sat close in councel with y? gods, Whose beauty did excel? And thence they crave A moderator of the strife to have, But least the partiall heavens could not decide The grudg, they stoop to Mortals to be try'd. Mantled in clouds then gently down they fall Upon Mount Ida to appease the brall, Where Priam's lovely Boy sporting did keep His Fathers lambes and snowy flocks of sheep, His lilly hand was soon ordain'd to bee The harmless Umpire of the fond decree. To him, to him they gave the Golden Ball, O happy goddess upon whom it fall! But more unhappy Shepeard, was't not pitty Thou didst not send it at a close Committee? There, there thou hadst surpass'd what did befall, Thou might'st have crowned One, yet pleased All. First then Imperious Juno did display Her coronet of glories to the Boy, And rang'd her stars up in an arched ring Of height and majesty most flourishing, Then wealth and honour at his foot did lay To be esteem'd the Lady of the day. Next Pallas that brave Heroina came, The thund'ring Queen of action, war &amp; fame, Dress'd in her glittering armes, wherewith she layes Worlds wast, &amp; new ones from their dust can raise, These, these she tenders him, advanc'd to bee, With all the wreaths of wit and gallantrie. Last Venus breaks forth of her golden raies, With thousand Cupids crown'd, ten thousand Boyes, Sparkling through every quadrant of her eyes, Which made her beauty in full glory rise: Then smiling vow'd so to sublime his parts To make him the great Conquerour of hearts. Thus poor distracted Paris all on fire Stood trembling deep in doubt what to desire, The sweet temptations pleaded hard for all, Each theatre of beauty seem'd to call For the bright prize: but he amazed hee Could not determine which, which, which was shee At last the Cyprian Girle so strook him blinde In all the faculties of soul and minde, That he poor captiv'd wretch without delay Could not forbear his frailty to betray, But maugre honour, wisdom, all above, He ran &amp; kiss'd &amp; crown'd the Queen of Love. Pallas and Juno then in high disdain Took snuff and posted up to heaven again, As to a high Court of appeal, to bee Reveng'd on men for this indignitie. ‘Hence then it happens that the Ball was lost ‘'Tis two to one but love is alwaies crost. Upon a Flye that flew into a Lady's eye, and there lay buried in a tear. Poor envious Soul! what couldst thou see In that bright Orb of puritie? That active globe? That twinkling sphear Of beauty to be medling there? Or didst thou foolishly mistake The glowing morn in that day-break? Or was't thy pride to mount so high Only to kisse the Sun and dye? Or didst thou think to rival all Don Phaethon and his great fall? And in a richer Sea of brine Drown Icarus again in thine? Twas bravely aim'd, and which is more Th'hast sunck the fable ore and ore. For in this single death of thee Th'hast banqurrupt all Antiquitie. O had the fair Ægiptian Queen Thy glorious monument out seen, How had she spared what time forbids The needlesse tott'ring Pyramids! And in an emulative chafe Have begg'd thy shrine her Epitaph? Where, when her aged marble must Resigne her honour to the dust, Thou mightst have canonized her Deceased Time's Executor? To ripp up all the western bed Of spices where Sol layes his head, To squeeze the Phœnix and her Nest In one perfume that may write Best, Then blend the gall'rie of the skyes With her Seraglio of eyes, T'embalm a name, and raise a Tombe The miracle of all to come, Then, then compare it: Here's a Gemm A Pearl must shame and pitty them. An amber drop, distlled by The sparkling Limbeck of an eye, Shall dazle all the short essaies Of rubbish worth, and shallow praise. We strive not then to prize that tear Since we have nought to poise it here. The world's too light. Hence, hence we cry The world, the world's not worth a Fly. Obsequies To the memory of the truly Noble, right Valiant and right Honourable Spencer Earle of Northampton Slain at Hopton Field in Saffordshire in the beginning of this Civill War. VVhat? The whole world in silence? Not a tear In tune through all the speechless Hemisphære? Has grief so seiz'd and sear'd man-kinde in all The convoyes of Intellegence? No fall But those of Waters heard? No Elegies But such as whine through th'organs of our eyes? Can Pompey fall again? And no Pen say Here lies the Romane Liberty in clay? Or can his bloud Boe-die th'Egiptian Sand, And the black crime doe less than tann the land? And make the Region instead of a verse And tombe his sable Epitaph and Hearse? So here Northampton that brave Heroe fell Tryumphant Roman thy pure paralell, The blush and glory of his Age: Who dyed In all points happy, but the Weaker side. Only to forreign parts he did not roam, The kinde Egiptians met him nearer home. Both, and such, Causes, that the world confess There's nought to plead against them but Success. Malignant Loyalty! a glorious fame And sin, for which God never found a name. Which had it scaped the Rubrick of these times Had still continued among Holy Crimes. A Text on which we finde no gloss at all But in the Alcorn of Gold-smiths Hall! Now (Great Adolphus) give me leave to stir The ashes of thy Urne, and Sepulcher; And branch the flowers of the Sweadish glory As rivall'd to the life in our sad story: Yet not impaire thy plumes, by adding more To suit that splendor from a neighbour shore; Nor deem thy honor less thus match'd to bee, If Compton dyed to grasping Victorie. An active soul in gallant fury hurl'd To club with all the worthies of the world. Blinde, envious, piping Fortune! what could bee The tottering ground of this thy trecherie? To stop the ballance of that brave Carrear Was both at once thy miracle and fear? Was't not a pannick dread surpriz'd thy soul Of being made servile to his high controul? Blush and confess poor Caitiff-godess! so Wee'le quit his in thy reall over-throw. And Death, thou worm! thou pale Assassinate! Thou sneaking hireling of revenge and hate, Didst not thou feel an Earth-quake in thy bones? Such as rends Rocks and their foundations? No Tirtian shivering, but an Ague fit Which with a burning Feaver shall commit The world to ashes? when thou stolest creptst under That Helmet which durst dare Jove and his thunder But since the bays he reacht at grew not here, Like a wise souldier, and a Cavalier, He left his coveteous enemie at bay, Rifling the carriage of his flesh and clay: While his rich soul pursued the greater game Of Honour to the skies, there fix'd his name. I shall not therefore vex the Orbs to trace Thy sacred foot-steps in that hallow'd place. Nor start a feigned Star, and swear it thine, Then stretch the Constellation to thy line. Like a Welch Gentleman that tacks his kin To all Coats in the countrey he lives in. Nor yet, to raise thy Flaming Crest, shall I Knock for the wandring Planets in the sky: Perhaps some broken beauty of stale doubt, To comment on her face has hir'd them out. Let fame, &amp; thy brave race thy Statue live, The world can never such another give. Whiles each soul sighes at the sad thought of thee There fell a Province of Nobilitie. A fall, had Zeal but husbanded its throat, That sunck the House of Lords, and saved the Vote. They only state mute Titles in their gears, He singly represented all the Peeres. One, had the enemy imployd their Smeck, Those Ring-worms of the Church, to beg a neck With Claudius, to metropolize all worth, Rome, &amp; what ere the Suburbe world brought forth, In him the sword did glut its ravening eye, The rest that kick'd up were the smaler Frye. Sparks only of that fire in him deceas'd, Nyfles that crack'd and vanish'd north &amp; west. He lead the Royal war in such a dye, In that dire entrance of the Tragedy, The sense (Great Charles) no longer to prorogue, None but thy self could speak the Epilogue. The London Lady. Gently my Muse! 'tis but a tender piece, A paradox of Fumes and Ambergreece. A cobweb-tinder at a touch takes fire, The tumbling wherligig of blinde desire. Vulcan's Pandora in a christal shrine, Or th'old Inn faced with a new painted signe. The spotted voyder of the Term: In short Chymical nature phisick'd into Art. But hold rude Satyr, here's a Hector comes, A Cod-peice Captain that with her shares sums, One claims a Joynture in her sins, the foile That puts her off, like the old man ere while That with a dagger Cloak, and ho-boy gapes And squeeks for company for the Jack an Apes. This is the feirce St. George, fore runs the waggon, And, if occasion be, shall kill the Dragon. Don Mars the great assendant on the road When Thomass's teem begins to jog abroad. The hinter at each turn of Coven Garden, The Club pickearer, the robust Church warden Of Lincolne's Inn back corner, where he angles For Cloaks and Hats, and the smale gam eentangles This is the Citty Usher straid to enter The small drink countrey squires of the first venter, And dubs them bach'lor-Knight of the black Jugg, Mans them into an oath, and the French shrugg, Makes them fine graduates in smock impudence, And gelds them of their puny mothers sense. So that when two terms more, and forty pound Reads them acquainted all Gomorrha round, Down to their wondring friends at last they range, With breeding just enough to speak them strange, And drown a younger brother in a look Kick a poor Lacquey, and berogue the Cook, Top a small cry of Tennants that dare stir In no phrase now, but save your Worship Sir. But to return: By this my Lady's up, Has swom the Ocean of the Cawdle Cup, Convers'd with every washing, every ground, And Fucus in the Cabinet's to be found, Has laid the fix'd complexion for the day, Her breech rings high Change and she must away. Now down the Channel towards the Strand she glides, Flinging her nimble glances on both sides, Like the death-darting Cockatrice that slye Close Enginere that murders through the eye. The first that's tickled with her rumbling wheels Is the old Statesman, that in slippers reels, He wire-drawes up his jawes, and snufs and grins, And sighing smacks, but for my aged shins, My Conclave of diseases, I would boord Your lofty Galley: Thus I serv'd my Lord—. But mum for that, his strength will scarce supply His back to the Belcone, so god b'wy. By this she has survey'd the golden Globe, And finding no temptation to disrobe, To Durham New Old Stable on she packs, Where having winc'd and breath'd the what d'yee lacks, Rusled and bounced a turn or two in ire, She mounts the Coach like Phaethon all on fire, Fit for th'impressions of all sorts of evill, And whirles up tow'rds the Lawyers and the Devill. There Ployden in his laced Ruff starch'd on edg Peeps like an Adder through a quickset hedg, And brings his stale demur to stop the course Of her proceedings with her yoak of horse; Then fals to handling of the case, and so Shews her the posture of her over-throw, But yet for all his Law and double Fees Shee'le bring him to joyn issue on his knees: And make him pay for expedition too, Thus the gray fox acts his green sins anew. And well he scapes if all his Norman sense Can save the burning of his Evidence. But out at last shee's hudled in the dark, Man'd like a Lady Client by the Clerk. And so the nimble youngster at the parting Extorts a smack perhaps before the Carting. Down Fleet-street next she rowls with powderd crest, To spring clip'd-half-crowns in the Cuckow's nest For now the Heroes of the yard have shut Their shops, and loll upon their bulks to put The Ladyes to the squeek, if so perhaps Their mistris can spare them from their laps. Not far she waves and sailes before she clings With the young tribe for pendents, lace and rings, But there poor totterd Madam, though to late, She meets the topsi-turvey of her state, For the calm'd Boyes, having nought left to pay, Are forced to pawn her, &amp; so run away. On this the dreadful Drawer soon appears, Like her ill Genius about her ears, With a long bill of Items that affright Worse than a skull of Halberds in the night. For now the Jay's compell'd to untruss all The tackling upon tick from every stall, Each sharing Broker of her borrow'd dress Seems to doe pennance in her nakedness. For not a Lady of the noble game But is composed at least of all Long-lane: An Animal together blow'd and made, And up'd of all the shreds of every Trade. Thus purely now her self, homewards she packs, Exciz'd in all the Dialects of her knacks: Squeez'd to the utmost thred, and latest grain, Like Meteors toss'd to their first grit again. A lane, a lane, she comes, summ'd down to nought, But shame and a thin under petticoat. But least I should pursue her to the quick, I pass: The chase lies now too near the nick In pitty Satyr then thy lash let fall: He knowes her best that scans her not at all. And though thou seemst discourteous not to save her, No matter, when thou leav'st there's one will have her. The Times. To speak in wet-shod eyes, and drowned looks, Sad broken accents, and a vein that brooks No spirit, life, or vigour, were to own The crush and tryumph of affliction; And creeping with Themistocles to bee The pale-faced pensioners of our enemie. No, 'tis the glory of the soul to rise By fals, and at re-bound to peirce the skies. Like a brave Courser standing on the sand Of some high-working Fretum, views a land Smiling with sweets upon the distant side, Garnish'd in all her gay imbroidred pride, woods, Larded with springs, and fring'd with curled Impatient, bounces, in the capring flouds, Big with a nobler fury than that stream Of shallow violence he meets in them; Thence arm'd with scorn &amp; courage ploughs a way Through the impostum'd billows of the Sea; And makes the grumbling surges slaves to oar And wast him safely to the further shoar: Where landed, in a soveraign disdain He turns back, and surveys the foaming main, Whiles the subjected waters flowing reel Ambitious yet to wash the victor's heel. In such a noble equipage should wee Embrace th'encounter of our miserie. Not like a field of corn, that hangs the head For every tempest, every petty dread. Crosses were the best Christians armes: and wee That hope a wished Canaan once to see Must not expect a carpet way alone Without a red-sea of affliction. Then cast the dice: Let's foord old Rubicon, Cæsar 'tis thine, man is but once undone. Tread softly though, least Scylla's ghost awake, And us in the roll of his Proscriptions take. Rome is revived, and the Triumvirate In the black Island are once more a state; The Citty trembles: Theres no third to shield If once Augustus to Antonius yield Law shall not shelter Cicero, the robe The Senate: Proud success admits no probe Of Justice to correct or quare the fate That bears down all as illegitimate; For whatsoere it lists to over-throw, It either findes it, or else makes it so. Thus Tyranny's a stately Palace, where Ambition sweats to climbe and nustle there; But when 'tis enterd, what hopes then remain? There is no salliport to come out again. For mischief must rowl on, and gliding grow Like little rivulets that gently flow From their first bubling springs, but still increase And swell their channel as they mend their pace; Till in a glorious tide of villany They over-run the bancks, and posting fly Like th'bellowing waves in tumults, till they can Display themselves in a full Ocean. And if blinde rage shall chance to miss its way Brings stock enough alone to make a Sea. Thus treble treasons are secur'd &amp; drownd By lowder crimes of deeper mouth and sound. And high attempts swallow a puny plot As Canons over-whelme the smaler shot. Whiles the deaf senseless world inur'd a while (Like the Catadupi at the fall of Nile) To the feirce tumbling wonder, think it none Thus custom hallows irreligion. And stroaks the patient beast till he admit The now-grown-light and necessary Bitt. But whether doe I ramble? Gauled times Cannot endure a smart hand ore their crimes. Distracted age? What dialect or fashion Shall I assume? To passe the approbation Of thy censorious Synod; which now sit High Areopagites to destroy all wit? I cannot say I say that I am one Of th'Church of Ely-house, or Abington, Nor of those pretious spirits that can deal The pomgranets of grace at every meal. No zealous Hemp-dresser yet dipp'd me in The Laver of adoption from my sin. But yet if inspiration, or a tale Of a long-wasted six hours length prevail, A smooth certificate from the sister-hood, Or to be termed holy before good, Religious malice, or a faith 'thout works Other then may proclaim us Jews or Turks. If these, these hint at any thing? Then, then Whoop my dispairing Hope come back agen. For since the inundation of grace, All honesty's under water, or in chase. But 'tis the old worlds dot age, thereupon We feed on dreams, imagination, Humours, and cross-graind passions which now reign In the decaying elements of the brain. Tis hard to coin new fancies, when there bee So few that launch out in discoverie. Nay Arts are so far from being cherished, There's scarce a Colledg but has lost its Head, And almost all its Members: O sad wound! Where never an Arterie could be judged sound! To what a hight is Vice now towred? When we Dare not miscall it an Obliquitie? So confident, and carrying such an awe, That is subscribes it self no less than Law? If this be reformation then? The great Account pursued with so much bloud &amp; sweat? In what black lines shall our sad story bee Deliver'd over to posteritie? With what a dash and scar shall we be read? How has Dame Nature in us suffered? Who of all Centuries the first age are That sunck the World for want of due repair? When first we issued out in cries and tears, (Those salt presages of our future years) Head-long we dropt into a quiet calme, Times crownd with rosie garlands, spice and balme; Where first a glorious Church &amp; mother came, Embrac'd us in her armes, gave us a name By which we live, and an indulgent brest Flowing with stream to an eternal rest. Thus ravish'd the poor Soul could not ghuesse even Which was more kinde to her yet, earth, or heaven. Or rather wrapp'd in a pious doubt Of heaven, whether she were in or out. Next the Great Father of our Countrey brings His blessing too, (even the Best of Kings) Safe and well grownded Lawes to guard our peace, And nurse our vertues in their just increase; Like a pure spring from whom all graces come, Whose bounty made it double Christendom. Such and so sweet were those Halcyon Dayes That rose upon us in our Infant rayes; Such a composed State we breathed under, We only heard of Jove, nere felt his thunder. Terrours were then as strange, as love now grown, Wrong and revenge lived quietly at home. The sole contention that we understood Was a rare strife and war in doing good. Now let's reflect upon our gratfulness, How we have added, or (ô) made it less, What are th'improvements? what our progresse, where Those handsom acts that say that some men were? He that to antient wreaths can bring no more From his own worth, dyes banq'rupt, on the score. For Father's Crests are crowned in the Son, And glory spreads by propagation. Now vertue shield me! where shall I begin? To what a labyrinth am I now slipp'd in? What shall we answer them? or what deny? What prove? Or rather whether shall we fly? When the poor widdow'd Church shall ask us where Are all her honours? &amp; that filial care We owed so sweet a Parent as the Spouse Of Christ, which here vouchsafed to own a house? Where are her Boanerges? &amp; those rare Brave sons of consolation? Which did bear The Ark before our Israel, and dispence The heavenly Manna with such diligence? In them the prim'tive Motto's come to passe, Aut mortui sunt, aut docent literas. Bless'd Virgin we can only say we have Thy Prophets Tombes among us, and their grave. And here and there a man in colours paint That by thy ruines grew a mighty Saint. Next Cæsar some accounts are due to thee, But those in bloud already written bee. So lowd &amp; lasting, in such monstruous shapes, So wide the never to be clos'd wound gapes; All ages yet to come with shivering shall Recite the fearful pres'dent of thy fall. Hence we confute thy tenent Solomon, Under the Sun a new thing hath been done, A thing before all pattern, all pretence Of rule or coppy: Such a strange offence, Of such original extract, that it bears Date only from the Eden of our years. Laconian Agis! we have read thy fate, The violence of the Spartan love and hate. How Pagans trembled at the thought of thee, And fled the horror of thy tragedie. Thyestes cruel feast, and how the Sun Shrunk in his golden beams that sight to shun. The bosoms of all Kingdoms open lye, Plain and emergent to th'inquiring eye. But when we glance upon our native home, As the black Center to whom all points come, We rest amazed, and silently admire How far beyond all spleen ours did aspire. All that we dare assert is but a cry Of an exchanged peace for Liberty. A secret term by inspiration known, A mist that brooks no demonstration, Unless we dive into our purses, where We quickly finde Our Freedom purely dear. But why exclaim you thus? may some men say, Against the times? when equal night and day Keep their just course? the seasons still y? same? As sweet as when from the first hand they came? The influence of the Stars benigne and free, As at first Peep up in their infancie? Tis not those standing motions that devide The space of years, nor the swift hours y? glide Those little particles of age, that come In thronging Items that make up the Summ, That's here intended: But our crying crimes, Our monsters that abominate the times. Tis we that make the Metonymie good By being bad. Which like a troubled floud Nothing produce but slimy mire and dirt, And impudence that makes shame malepert. To travel further in these wounds that lye Rankling, though seeming closed, were to deny Rest to an ore-watch'd world, and force fresh tears From stench'd eyes, new alarum'd by old fears. Which if they thus shall heal &amp; stop, they bee The first that ere were cur'd by Lethargie. This only Axiom from ill Times increase I gather, There's a time to hold ones peace. The Model of the new Religion. Whoop! Mr. Uickar in your flying frock! What news at Babel now? how stands y? Cock? When wags the floud? no Ephimerides? Nought but confounding of the languages? No more of th'Saints arrival? or the chance Of three pipes two pence and an ordinance? How many Queere-religi?s? clear your throat, May a man have a peny-worth? four a groat? Or doe the Iuncto leap at truss a fayle? Three Tenents clap while five hang on the tayle? No Querpo model? never a knack or wile? To preach for spoons &amp; whistles? cross or pile? No hints of truth on foot? no sparks of grace? No late sprung light? to dance the wild-goose chase? No Spiritual Dragoons that take their flames From th'inspiration of the citty Dames? No crums of comfort to relieve our cry? No new dealt mince-meat of divinity? Come let's project: By the great late Eclipse We justly fear a famine of the lips. For sprats are rose an Omer for a sowse, Which gripes the c?clave of the lower House. Let's therefore vote a close humiliation For opening the seal'd eyes of this blinde Nation, That they may see confessingly and swear They have not seen at all this fourteen year. And for the splints and spavins too, tis said All the joints have the Riffcage, since the head Swelld so prodigious and exciz'd the parts From all allegiance, but in tears and hearts. But zealous S?. what say to a touch at praier? How Quops the spirit? In what garb or ayre? With Souse erect, or pendent, winks, or haws? Sniveling? or the extention of the jaws? Devotion has its mode: Dear Sir hold forth, Learning's a venture of the second worth. For since the people's rise and its sad fall We are inspir'd from much to none at all. Brother adiue! I see y'are closely girt, A costive Dover gives the Saints the squirt. Hence (Reader) all our flying news contracts Like the State's Fleet from the Seas into acts. But where's the model all this while you'le say? 'Tis like the Reformation run away. On Brittanicus his leap three story high, and his escape from London. Paul from Damascus in a basket slides Craned by the faithfull Brethren down the sides Of their embattel'd walls: Britanicus As loath to trust the Brethrens God with us. Slides too, but yet more desp'rate, and yet thrives In his descent, needs must the Devil drives. Their cause was both the same, &amp; herein meet, Only their fall was not with equal feet, Which makes the case Iambick: Thus we see How much news falls short of Divinitie. Truth was their crying crime: One takes the night, Th'other th'advantage of y? New sprung Light Mo mantle his escape: How different be The Pristin and the Modern Policie? Have Ages their Antipodes? Yet still Close in the Propagation of ill? Hence flowes this use and doctrine from the thump I last sustain'd (belov'd) Good wits may Jump. Content. Fair stranger! winged maid, where dost thou rest Thy snowy locks at noon? Or on what brest Of spices slumber ore the sullen night? Or waking whether dost thou take thy flight? Shall I goe seek some melanchollick grove? The silent theatre of dispair and love? There court the Bitterne and the Pelican Those Aiery Antipodes to the tents of man? Or sitting by some pretty pratling spring Hear hoarse Nyctimene her dirges sing? Whiles the rough Satyres dance Corantoes too The chattring Sembriefs of her Woo hoo, hoo? Or shall I trace some ice-bound wildernesse Among the caverns of abstruse recess? Where never prying Sun, nor blushing Day Could steal a glimps, or intersqueeze a ray? If not within this solitary Cell, O whether must I post? Where dost thou dwel? Shall I let loose the reins of blinde desire? And surfet every ravening sense? Give fire To any train? And tyre voluptuousnesse In all her soft varieties of excess? And make each day a history of sin? Drink the A la mort Sun down and up agen? Improve my crimes to such a roaring score, That when I dye, where others goe before In whining venial streams, and quarto pages, My flouds may rise in folio, sinck all ages? Or shall I bathe my selfe in widdows tears? And build my name in th'curse of them and theirs? Ship-wrack whole nature to craw out a purse With th'molten cinders of the universe? Belch nought but ruine? and the horrid cryes Of fire and sword? &amp; swim in drowned eyes? Make lanes to crowns &amp; scepters through th'heart's veins Of Justice, Law, Right, Church and Soveraigns? No, no, I trace thee not in this dark way Of death, this scarlet streak'd Aceldama. Shall I then to the house of mourning goe? Where the Salt-peeter Vuates over-flow With fresh supplies of grief? Fresh tides of brine? Or traverse the wide world in every line? Walk through the bowels of each realm and state Simpling for rules of policy to create Strang forms of government of new molds &amp; wasts Like a french Kickshaw of a thousand tasts? Or shall I dive into the secrecy Of Nature? Where the most retir'd doth lye? Or shall I waste the taper of my soul In scrutinies, where neither Northern-pole Nor Southern-constellation darts a light To constitute a latitude or height? Or shall I float into the watry pale Wan kingdom of the Moon? and there set sail For all the Orbs? and keep high holiday With th'Nectar-tipling-Gods in th'milky-way? Swell Bacchus tripes with a tun of lusty Sack? And lay the Plump Squire flat upon his back? O no, these revels are too short, too soure, Too sad, hugg'd and repented in an hour. Shall I then plough the seas to forreign soils? And rake the pregnant Indies for hid spoyls? Or with the Anchorite abhor the eye Of heaven, and banish all society. Live in, and out the world? and pass my dayes In treading out some strang misterious maze? Tast every humane sweet? lilly and rose? With all the sharp guard y? about them grows? Climb wher dispair would tremble to set foot? Spring new impossibles and force way to't? Make the whole globe a shop of Chymistry To melt down all her attomes, and descry That small Iota, that last pittied grain Which the gull'd sons of men pursue in vain? Or shal I grasp those meteors, fame, &amp; praise? Which breath by th'charity of y? vulgar voice? Pile honour upon honour till it crack The Atlas of my pride, and break its back? Hold fancy, hold! for whether wilt thou bear My sun-burnt hope to loss? 'Tis, 'tis not here. Soar then (My Soul) above the arched round Of these poor spangled blisses: Here's no ground To fix the sacred foot of pure Content, Her mansion's in a higher element. Hast thou perceiv'd the sweetness of a groan? Or tried the wings of contemplation? Or hast thou found the balm of tears that press Like amber in the dregs of bitterness? Or hast thou felt that secret joy that flowes Against the tide of common over-throws? Or hast thou known the dawnings of a God Upon thee, when his love is shed abroad? Or hast thou heard the sacred harmonie Of a calm Conscience ecchoing in thee A Requiem from above? A sealed peace Beyond the power of hell, sin, or decease? Or hast thou tasted that communion Between a reconciled God and Man? That holy intercourse? Those pretious smiles Dissolv'd in holy whisprings between whiles? Here, here's the steps lead to her bless'd abode; Her chair of state is in the throne of God. May Day. Come Gallants, why so dull? What muddy cloud Dwells on the eye-brows of the day? Why shroud Ye up your selves in the furl'd sayles of night, And tossing lye at Hull? Hark how delight Knocks with her silver wings at every sense? And great Apollo Laureal doth Commence? Up 'tis the golden Jubilee of the year, The Stars are all withdrawn from each glad Sphear Within the tyring-rooms of heaven, unlesse Some few that peep to spy our happinesse Whiles Phœbus tugging up Olympus craw Smoaks his bright Teem along on the Gram Paw Heark how the songsters of the shady plain Close up their Anthems in a melting strain! See where the glittring Nimphs whirl it away In Checkling Caravans as blyth as May; And th'Christal sweating flowers droop their heads In blushing shame to call you slug-a beds. Waste but a glance upon Hide-park, and swear All Argus eyes are falln, and fixed there. The dapled lawns with Ladies shine &amp; glow, Whiles bubling mounts with springs of Nectar flow; And each kinde Turtle sits and bills his Dove Dike Venus and Adonis lapp'd in love. Heark how Amyntas in melodious loud Shrill raptures tunes his horn-pipe! whiles a crowd Of snow-white milk-maids crownd with garlands gay Trip it to the soft measure of his Lay. And fields with curds and cream like green-cheese lye, This now or never is the Gallaxie. If the facetious Gods ere taken were With mortal beauties and disguis'd, 'tis here. See how they mix societies, and tosse The tumbling ball into a willing losse, That th'twining Ladyes on their necks might take The doubled kisses which they first did stake. Those pretty earnests of a maiden-head Those sugred seals of love, types of the bed, Which to confirm the sweet conveiance more They throng in thousand times ten thousand score Such heavenly surfets, as they sporting lye, Thus catch they from each others lipp &amp; eye. The game at best, the girls May rould must bee, Where Croyden and Mopsa, he and shee Each happy pair make one Hermophrodite, And tumbling bounce together, black &amp; white, Where had you seen the chance, you had not known Whose shew had lovelier bin Madam's or Joan. Then crown the bowle let every conduit run Canary, till we lodg the reeling Sun. Tap every joy, let not a pearl be spilt, Till we have set the ringing world a tilt. And sacrifice Arabia Fælix in One bone fire, one incense offering. Tis Sack, tis Sack that drowns y? thorny cares Which hedg the pillow, and abridg our years, The quickning Anima Mundi that creates Life in dejection, and out dares the Fates, Makes man look big on danger, and out swell The fury of that thrall that threatens Hell. Chirp round my Boyes: let each soul take its sipp, Who knows what fals between the cup and lip? What can a voluntary pale look bring Or a deep sigh to lessen suffering? Has mischief any piety or regard? The foyl of misery is a brest prepar'd. Hence then with folded armes, ecclipsed eyes, And low imprison'd groans, meek cowardise. Urge not with oars death y? in full saile comes, Nor walk in forestal'd blacks to y? dark tombs. But rather then th'eternal jaws shall gape, Gallop with Curtius down the gallant hap. Mean time here's that shall make our shackles light, And charm the dismal terrors walk by night, Tis this that chears the drooping soul, revives The benum'd captive cr?p'd in his cold gyves. Kingdoms and Cottages, the Mill and Throne Sack the Grand Leveller commands alone. Tis Sack that rocks the boyling brain to rest, Confirms the aged hams, and warms the brest Of gallantry to action, runs half share And mettal with the buff-fac'd Sons of war. Tis wit, 'is art, 'tis strength, 'tis all and more; Then looss the floud gates Georg, wee'le pay or score. An Epig. to Doulus. Doulus advanced upon a goodly Steed, Came mounting ore the plain in very deed, Wherat the people cring'd &amp; bow'd the knee, In honour of my Lord's rich Liverie. Hence swell not Doulus, nor erect thy crest, Twas for the Goddess sake we capp'd the beast. An Epig. on the people of England. Sweating and chafing hot Ardelio cryes A Boat a Boat, else farwel all the prize. But having once set foot upon the deep Hotspur Ardelio fell fast a sleep. So we, on fire with zealous discontent, Call'd out a Parliament, a Parliament. Which being obtain'd at last, what did they doe? Even squeez the wool-packs, &amp; lye snorting too. Another. Brittain a lovely Orchard seem'd to be Furnish'd with nature's choise varietie, Temptatious golden fruit of every sort, Th'Hesperian Garden fann'd from fein'd report, Great boyes and smal together in we brake, No matter what disdain'd Priapus spake, Up, up we lift the great Boyes in the trees, Hoping a common share to sympathize: But they no sooner there neglected streight The shoulders that so rais'd them to this height; And fell to stuffing of their own bags first, And as their treasure grew, so did their thirst. Whiles we in lean expectance gaping stand For one shake from their charitable hand. But all in vain the dropsie of desire So scortch'd them, three Realms could not quench the fire. Be wise then in ynur Ale bold youths: for fear The Gardner catch us as Moss caught his Mare. An Elegie Upon my dear little friend M. I: F. Who dyed the same morning he was born. Decem. 10. 1654. Come all yee widdowed Muses, &amp; put on Your veils, and mourn in a full Helicon. Press every doleful string to bear a part In the sad harmonie of a broken heart. Bring all your sacred springs as sweet supplies To feed the swelling ocean of mine eyes. Be dumb yee Sons of mirth, let not a joy Pry through the smalest crannie of the day: But let an awful silence seize the soul Of universal motion, whiles wee towl Love's passing Bell, and ring a loud to all Little Adonis and his mighty fall. Malignant Heaven! can there be envy there Where never gall nor sequestration were? Is't possible that in so pure a shrine So consecrate, so holy, so divine As thy bless'd mansions, there can dwel a grain Or attome of black malice or disdain? That for to boast thy riches to poor men Could'st drop a pearl and snatch it up agen? First scrue us to an Extasie of blisse Then dash us by an Antipe'ristasis? Punnish a moment's ravishing happiness With such a furious glut of sharp distress? Could light &amp; darkness be so twin'd together In such close webs of bitter chang of weather, Just parted by a single subtile thred No sooner to be judg'd a live but dead? Could wit and fate no less a torment finde? Would th'hadst not bin so cruel, or so kinde! Bless'd Babe! why could not thy friends many tears Invite thine innocent stay for a few years? Or at the least why didst thou them bereave Of the short comfort of a longer leave? How can that drown the anguish of thy birth For joy a man was born upon the earth? When th'Midwife only could arrive to this To reach thee to thy first and latest kiss? How loaded with ingratitude didst thou part From thy twice travelling Mother in one smart? First pain'd for thy remiss and slow delay, Now thrown for thy abortive hast away? But yet I wrangle not with heavens decree, Th'hast only posted ore that miserie, Through which we beat the hoof sad Seventy Years To the last Act of life, in hopes and fears, Midst a perverse world, and a shipwrack'd-age Of Truth and Worth, &amp; draw late off the Stage. To lay more weight or pressure upon thee Twere envy to thy suddain victorie. Thou only wak'dst into the world, and then Shut'st up in holy discontent agen. Thy chast unspoted soul just lighted on The floor and perch of our low Horison, But quickly finding the mistake, that here Was not her Center, nor her Hemisphære, She made a point, and darted back most nice Like lightening to her element in a trice. The Thracian Dranst which with joy interr Their Dead, and sport about their Sepulchre, But mourn still at their birth, to think upon Those choaking cares of earth are coming on, May here preach rules of piety to my grief, In bad times doubting what's best death or life Crown'd Saint indeed thou might'st have staid. A mournfull Student in our historie, Have read a world of sad looks in each page to bee And passage of a sore distracted age, And then discussd the causes how and why, Which to repeat renews th'extremity; So have entail'd thy guiltless tears to ours Now swel'd to flouds by long continued showers. But thou hast wrought that haven in a breath, For which we sweat &amp; tug our selves to death. Thou met'st no tempest of assault to stay Thy fleeting bark in full sail all the way. Wee're clogd with thousand Remoraes, men of war That cross the rode, through which with many a scar And foil we militant Christians doe c?mence, And at the last take heaven by violence. Such was thy suddain how-dee &amp; farewell, Such thy return the Angels scarce could tell Thy miss, But that thy feast was drawing on Of th'Son of God's high Genethliacon, Where all the holy Hosts appear to sing Solemn Te Deum's to the glorious King. Hence flowes thy sweet excuse of hast: Then since Our loss was thy enjoyment of thy Prince, The Annual attendance on his Day To fill the heavens with Haleluiah. Yet grant us so much of the court, to bee Envious a while at thy felicitie, That thou so young a favourite shouldst pertake Those smiles for which we so much cringing make. And reach that height of honour in a glance, For which we toil through Law &amp; Ordinance. I chide thee then no longer Happy Soul, Farewel, farewel! since man cannot controule The hand of Providence. May thine ashes lye Soft, till I meet thee in eternity! Where we shal part no more, nor death devide My griefs and their sweet object, but a tide Of endlesse joy shall satisfaction make For this poor stream of brine shed for thy sake. A short reflection on the creation of the World. When as this circling Globe of Seas and Earth Snugg'd in her night-clothes, and had neither birth Nor motion, but a lumpish Caos stood, An immaterial mass of slimy mud, A confus'd pre-existent nothing, where Tis blasphemy to say as yet things were. The great Eternal Being thought it good His Spirit here should move upon the floud. Hence bloom'd the early and the infant light From out the swathe-bands of eternal night, Which now furl'd up in sooty curls gives back And place to Time to date its Almanack. Whiles Midwife-Nature fits the Vacuum For the conceal'd impressions yet to come. This glimmering splendor in its course begun Christ'ned three dayes before there was a Sun. Thus things with things in mix'd confusion hurl'd Lift up their eye-lids, &amp; Thus wak'd the World. Nor was it yet broad day to any sight, For time walk'd as it were by candle-light. The East had not yet guilded bin by those Bright sparks by which she now most Orient growes. When as the mutt'ring Elements took their place And Centers as their several nature was. The active fire first clipp'd the azure Round, To which the grosser ayre became a bound, Each in his proper Orbe was stay'd and pent Environ'd by a solid Firmament. This was the time when th'rendevouzing floud Disbodying from the earth upon heaps stood, And Neptune ore that raging bulk of brine Advanc'd his Mace and Scepter tridentine. Whiles the dry land peepp'd up out of the froth Like a short Commons in a sea of broth; Spangled with fruits &amp; flowers, herbs &amp; grass, And this the teeming world's First up-rise was. Not long this beauty had in twilight lay But God made lights to sunder night and day; And deck the checkred palace of the skyes With thousand Coronets of twinkling eyes Which by their rule &amp; aspects in their spears, Should be for signes and seasons, months and years. And now if ever there was harmony Amongst those blessed motions up on high, Twas in this instant, when in joynt consent They danc'd this mask about the Firmament, And plac'd that heavenly round which ore &amp; ore Must be renew'd till time shall be no more. Next, those rich bodyes of the Sun and Moon, Like the High Constables of the watch, for noon And night, drew forth in glory, wh?ce created Tis much more safe admired than debated. Thus the Surveyors of the world took birth, And this was The good morrow of the Earth. There wanted nothing now, trees, herbs, nor plants, Nor sweets, but a few wilde inhabitants, Fish and the reptile creature; winged Quires Of downy Organists for to tune their Lyres, And fill the breaking ayre with Rapsodies Of chirping emulation to the skies. Thus the self generative streams brought forth Th'Amphibious brood of water and of earth. The shady woods now range with ecchoing straines Of shrill melodious notes; whose pretty chains Tye up the ears of things in silent love As 'twere a glimpse of heaven dropt from above. Next came the silver harnass'd scaley fry Capring upon the deep, to give supply To every pretty winding brook, which now With tatling springs and living plenty flow. Thus Nature peep'd out in her morning dresse Though not arrived to a full readinesse. And now the sixth day of God's labour dawnes, Whenas the blowing meads and tufted lawns Are stock'd with lowing beasts of every kinde, The bleating snowy sheep, &amp; fruitful hinde, All creatures of all sorts for game and food, Which by the vote of heaven were very good. The little world and complement of all Was only absent, for whose sake they call The Grand Consilio of the gods to make Man, which of earth and heaven should pertake God's Image and the globe's Epitome Must in one structure both united bee. Hence then the low and lofty Steward came To head the Collonies, and gave things a name Even Adam that prime moving dust, y? small And great Vicegerent of the God of all. Thus the world walk'd abroad rich as the sun, And God's work ended where Man's work begun. Now that we have survey'd this tumbling Ball How &amp; whence made, take a short touch on al. And first of that great mercy, y? prime cause From which all causes spring and take their Laws Twas meerly The eternal will &amp; Love Of God reveal'd in time that did him move To raise an universe of beauty, where Was neither forme nor mediate matter there. And thence he fram'd not man first as y? summ And supream piece of all that was to come, But brought him to a Furnish'd World, compleat In all proportions, bad him take and eate, Subdue and have dominion, raign, command, And supervize the wonders of his hand. The only homage he sought on his part Was but the service of an upright heart, A pure obedience and a station in That innocency which yet had known no sin. But why in just six dayes God and no more Compleated up this building and this store May some men ask? Was it a type of the Fix'd Crisis of the world's Catastrophe? Which the old Rabbins of the Jews suppose After six thousand years shall have its close? When all flesh shall an endless Sabbath keep While sin and time &amp; death are lull'd a sleep? I dare not fathom these deep misteries Conceal'd even from the very Angells eyes. As the beginning of all things hid lay In the Almighty bosom, where no ray Could pry into its purpose: So we now May ghuess the end as undiscover'd, how Or when, lies lapp'd up in th'obscure decree And secret cabinet of the dietie. This only we dare say we know, as light Began, so fire shall be the world's good night. Thus having through this glorious week's work prest Where God left labour I presume to rest. John chap. 18. ver. 36. My Kingdom is not of this World. True blessed Saviour, true! thy Kingdom's not Of this world. For we cannot finde a spot Of thy Crown Land, where Geometrie may stay Her reeling compass to move any way In demonstration of that circling Round That may define th'inclosure Holy ground: But since thy Church grew Stately &amp; fell down, The lands are all confiscate from the Crown. Countrey freez Elders have thy Flesh hooks bin To shrive the Levites Pot and all within. And never conscious of thy pious rule Leave poor Elias to th'charity of the foul. Or like the Indian Astomi, to smell His way to life, or live by miracle. Thus Sion's wasted, and thy Prophets slain: And Godlinesse hath proov'd the only Gain. Math. chap. 11 ver. 28. Come unto me all yee that labour and are heavy laden &amp;c. Most great and glorious God! how sweet, how free Is thy kinde invitation! but ay mee The clogs of sin So rein me in And black shame mix'd with guilt restrains my will From all designes but doing ill, So that I tremble to approach thy throne, And tread the Courts of the most Holy One. But yet thy Call's so powerfully good, So pressing, that 'tis death if once withstood. Nor is it less To tempt thy Holiness. In this extream this streight what shall I doe? I'de come, but bee accepted too: But ô my loud-tongu'd sins so fill the ayre They'le bar up heaven against my cry &amp; prayer. Yet wherfore should I doubt? 'Tis not the call Of Cherubims, or ought Angelical; Tis he, tis hee That in that extasie Of fear to sincking Peter reach'd his hand And snatch'd him from y? grave to land; Jehovah, he that tryes the reines, and sees Our wounds and moanes, our deep infirmities. Shall I then with poor Adam strive to hide My nakedness with leavs? Or slip a fide? O no, he spyes my way By night as by noon day: Darkness cannot exclude him, nor the shade Of Hell from what his hands have made; He knows our thoughts ev? long before they were, And when those lips bid come, can there be fear? But ô 'tis said hee's a Consuming fire! But ô 'tis sure he now layes by his ire: He thunders out With trumpets shout No Judgment from mount Sinai: But a still Soft voice of love and free good will. He that appear'd then in a warlike dress, Seeks now the stray sheep in the Wilderness. Put off thy terrors then Great God, and I Shall humbly prostrate at thy foot-stool lye; And there bemoan With many a groan And bitter tear my sinful sins to thee, To thee alone canst pardon mee. O shut not up thy mercy in disdain, Nor yet remember my old sins again! Impute not my youth's guilt unto my charge? But thou that offer'st Rest, set me at large Even from this death, And hell beneath That gapes with open jaws to swallow all That on thee doe neglect to call; And hardned in their sins thy spirit grieve By a contempt and wilful hate to live. But ere thou c?m'st bless'd God to pass me by First hide me from thy sin-abhorring eye, That I may stand Like Moses cover'd with thy hand Close in the cilft of Christ's wounds, in y? dress And garment of his Righteousnesse, And on me through his satisfaction look, That on his score my sad transgressions took. Receive me then, but with that kinde regret The good old man his prodigal childe met, Who as't appears Devided betwixt joy and tears Ran and embrac'd, &amp; kiss'd his drooping Son, In all points now undone, But that rich treasure of a Father's love Which nere could be exhausted, nor remove. Such bowels of compassion Lord put on! Such pregnant yernings of affection! Then hear my cry, And heal my malady. Though I have sinn'd yet Christ hath satisfied. O Judg not, for 'tis he that dyed. But hear the voice of his still streaming gore Which calls to thee for mercy more &amp; more. Prevent not then thy Angels joy in mee To see a sinner reconcil'd to thee! Nor let thy love So barren prove, Or loose its end for which thou sent'st it here, Even my salvation now so neer. What pleasure in my bloud Lord c? there be? Or will the chambers of death honour thee? Thy call is not a summons to the Bar Of Justice, but a throne where mercies are Like flowing balm To mitigate and calm The tumult of a rageing conscience; Whose pricking bitter ecchoing sense Holds out a flag of death, whose motto runs No hope, no peace, no such rebellious Sons. But Lord thy sweeter promise is the ground We lean &amp; build upon; canst thou be found Lesse than thy self? A ship-destroying shelf? No, though an Angel from thine Altar swear My sins unpardonable are, My crimes so great cannot forgiven bee, Yet Lord I come, yet Lord I trust in thee. O then accept my Heavy laden Soul Crush'd with the burden of her sins, so soul She dares not brook Once up to look; But drown'd in tears presumes to come on board, And for this once to take thy word; If I at last prove ship-wrack'd for my pain I'le never venture soul more so again. A Sing-song on Clarinda's Wedding Now that Love's Holiday is come, And Madg the Maid hath swept y? room And trimm'd her spit and pot, A wake my merry Muse, and sing The Revells, and that other thing That must not be forgot. As the gray morning dawn'd, tis sed Clarinda broke out of her bed Like Cynthia in her pride: Where all the Maiden Lights that were Compriz'd within our Hemisphære Attended at her side. But wot you then with much a doe They dress'd the Bride from top to toe And brought her from her chamber, Deck'd in her robes and garments gay More sumptuous than the live-long-day Or Stars enshrin'd in Amber. The sparkling bullose of her eyes Like two ecclipsed Suns did rise Beneath her christal brow, To shew like those strange accidents Some suddain changable events Were like to hap below. Her cheeks bestreak'd with white and red Like pretty tell-tales of the bed Presag'd the blustring night With his encricling armes and shade Resolv'd to swallow and invade And skreen her virgin light. Her lips those threds of scarlet dye, Wherein Love's charmes and quiver lye, Legions of sweets did crown; Which smilingly did seem to say O crop me, crop me whiles you may, A non th'are not mine own. Her Breasts those melting Alps of snow On whose fair hills in open shew The God of Love lay napping; Like swelling Buts of lively Wine Upon their ivory stells did shine To wait the lucky tapping. Her waste that slender type of man Was but a small and single span, Yet I dare safely swear He that whole thousands has in fee Would forfeit all, so he might bee Lord of the Mannor there. But now before I passe the line Pray Reader give me leave to dine, And pause here in the midle; The Bridegroom and the Parson knock, With all the Hymeneall flock, The Plum-cake and the Fidle. When as the Priest Clarinda sees, He stared as't had bin half his fees To gaze upon her face: And if the spirit did not move His continence was far above Each sinner in the place. With mickle stir he joyn'd their hands, And hamp'red them in marriage bands As fast as fast might bee, Where still me thinks, me thinks I hear That secret sigh in every eare, Once love remember mee! Which done the Cook he knock'd amain And up the dishes in a train Come smoaking two and two, With that they wip'd their mouths and sate, Some fell to quaffing, some to prate, Ay marry and welcome too In pay'rs they thus impal'd the meat Roger and Marget, and Thomas and Kate, Rafe and Bess, Andrew and Maudlin, And Valentine eke with Sybell so sweet, Whose cheeks on each side of her snuffers did meet As round and as plump as a codling. When at the last they had fetched their freez, And mired their stomacks quite up to y? knees In claret for and good chear, Then, then began the merry din, For as it was thought they were all on the pin, O what kissing and clipping was there! But as luck would have it y? Parson said grace, And to frisking &amp; dancing they shuffled apace, Each Lad took his Lass by the fist, And when he had squeez'd her, and gaum'd, her untill The fat of her face ran down like a mill He toll'd for the rest of the grist. In sweat and in dust having wasted the day, They enter'd upon the last act of the play, The Bride to her bed was convey'd, Where knee deep each hand fell downe to the ground And in seeking the Garter much pleasure was found, 'Twould have made a man's arm have stray'd This clutter ore Clarinda lay Half bedded, like the peeping day Behind Olimpus cap; Whiles at her head each twittring Girle The fatal stocking quick did whirle To know the lucky hap. The Bridegroom in at last did rustle, All dissap-pointed in the bustle The Maidens had shav'd his breeches; But let him not complain, tis well In such a storm, I can you tell He save'd his other stitches. And now he bounc'd into the bed, Even just as if a man had said Fair Lady have at all; Where twisted, at the hug they lay, Like Venus and the sprightly Boy, O who would fear the fall? Thus both with love's sweet tapers fired, And thousand balmy kisses tyred, They could nor wait the rest, But out the folk and candles fled, And to't they went; but what they did There lyes the cream of the jest. On the much to be lamented Death of that gallant Antiquary and great Master both of Law and Learning, John Selden Esquire. Epicedium Elegiacum. Thus sets th'Olimpian Regent of the day Laden with honour; after a full survey Of the deep works of nature, to return With greater lustre from his watery urne. Thus leans the aged Cedar to the rage Of tempests, which the grove for many an age Hath grac'd, yet yields to be tr?sp?lted thence T'adorn the nobler Palace of his Prince. Thus droops the world, after a smiling May And June of pride into a withering day, And hoary winter season, to appear More lovely in the buds of a fresh year. Then boast not Time in the eclipsed light Of Selden's lower orbes, whiles the high flight Of his enthroned Soul looks down on thee With scorn, as an ungrateful enemie. For in his death thou sport'st with thy own dust, Whiles with his ashes thy poor glories rust. Mention no more thy Acts of old, nor those Grand ruines rich in thy proud overthrowes; In him th'hast lost thy Titles and thy name, Who dyed the Register of time and fame. He was that brave Recorder of the world, When age &amp; mischief had conspir'd &amp; hurl'd Vast kingd?s into shatter'd heaps; who could Redeem them from their vaults of dust and mould. Then raise a monument of honour to That restor'd life, w?? death could nere undoe. Such was the fal of this Tenth worthy then, This Magazine of earth and heaven, and men, He, whereas others to their ashes creep, (Those common elements of all that sleep;) Dissolv'd like some huge Vatican from on high Whose every limbe became a Library. As therefore in the works of Nature they Which are most ripe are neerest to decay: So here this neighbouring Pyramid on th'sky Drew neerest heaven when furthest from the eye. And now thy Mare Clausum's true indeed, The rode's block'd up to th'many reined steed, Which to each point of the world's compasse reels, And tacks her glad discoveries to her keels. Let then the travelling Mariner in the deep Of the Reserves of reason goe to sleep; Since the grave Pole-star of the groaping sky Has suffer'd ship-wrack in mortallity. He y? would praise thee well through all thy parts Must ransack all the languages and arts, Drain nature to th'last scruple to discry How far thou went'st in her Anatomy. Then climbe from orbe to orbe, &amp; gather there The pure Elixar of each star and sphear, Which in thy life did club their influence With thy rich flames as one Intelligence; Then raise a blazing comet to thy name, As a devoted Taper to thy Fame, To live the pitied shadow of that day And glorious Noon which with thee drew away. When Common People dye, 'tis but a sight Whose grief and dole's digested in a night. But when such brawny sinews of a state As thee break loose; 'tis like a clock whose weight Being slipp'd a side all motion's at a stand: Such sorrows doe not wet but Drown a land. Could we with that brave Macedonian Spark Offer whole towns and kingdoms to the Ark Of a lost friend now floating in our eyes, And make more worlds in this grief sympathize, T'were but due thanks for that high soveraignty Ore many nations we enjoy'd in thee To languish any longer at thy shrine, Melting the sacred sisters into brine In a salt Hecatomb of tears, 'twould bee But a weak, faint and pale discoverie Of those few artires of life they have Since the last mortal stab giv'n in thy Grave. Such was the publick universal wound That the whole bod' of Law &amp; learning found In thy preposterous and most sad decease, There's none can probe y? grief, or state y? case. In short, we lost so many Tongues in thee There's scarce one left to mourn thine obsequie. Those shallow issues which now from us rise Steal through the speechless conduits of our eyes, Which turning Water Poets tumble forth Insilent eloquence to bemoan thy worth. Such deep impressions has thy farewel left In every bosom, every secret cleft Of each particular soul, instead of verse We live thy doleful Epitaph and Hearse. And what the mournful Prophet sigh'd of old Seems now broke forth, as of these times foretold. Each face shall gather blackness, for in thee Thus gone, w' are shut up in obscuritie. Such borrowed dependance had our light Upon thy sun, thy evening was our night. But since there's no perfection here, thy glass To become gold indeed translated was. Thy furnish'd soul being fill'd with all y? could Be here extracted from the grosser mould Of earth's Idea, in a brave disdain Drew to its proper Center, that vast Main Of truth and knowledg, great Jehovah, hee That's all in all to all eternitie. Where now I leave thee 'midst a glorious throng Of Saints; but hope to see thee ere't be long. Upon the death of John Selden Esquire. Now thou art dead, Unequall'd Sir, thy fall Confounds no less than England's funerall; For when y? soul departs that gave her breath, We are but loathed carkases in thy death. Thus Pompey's Trunck found on the Egyptian sand Rome streight pronounc'd her time was at a stand. So wh? a fair ag'd Oak doth downward move We count not one Tree's loss, but the whole Grove. As ayre and water when once useless grown One by too much drouth, one b'infection, The Citty and Kingdom both deplore y? loss: And we entitle't one man's private cross. O that Pythagoras doctrine might obtain, (Old souls to inform new bodyes hast again) Then would y? world less sense of sorrow have, Nought but to life a back-door were thy Grave! And like the Phœnix dy'dst in balmy spice, That th?ce thou might'st into new glories rise. But this we hope not for, &amp; 'tis thy praise Alone &amp; Salomon's, (None such in your dayes.) Learned Maimonides hence improv'd his fame, That none since Moses, such a Moses came. Joseph's perfections had out-shin'd far more, If Julius Scaliger had not writ before. Thou like Melchizedeck knewst no peer nor mate, Rich only with thy own true estimate. Witness those matchless volumes that can tell The world how vast a soul did in thee dwell. So fraught with such a Mine of knowledg, we Might think thee well a living Librarie. Not like our Time-enthusiasts, who disclose In scurrile Pens, that they can rave in prose, And in such narrow hoops y? conscience pent, As man nere durst, nor God for laws ere meant. Nay souls of men with such high reins keep in, That to be reasonable is counted sin. No, in such season'd Judgment flowd thy Pen, We thence might learn what temper became men. Thou nor to Sects, nor to parties writt'st (&amp; tis But just to point thee singular in this.) But wiht unwearied pain dispenc'd thy store, What all past ages thought and said before. Arabians, Persians, Hebrews, Greeks and all The Sun in'ts circuit dines or sups withall Thee in their several Idioms court, and bring Their common-wealths of learning to their King As tribute. Selden hadst thou flourished than When Jew and Greek, Creet and Arabian What each in varied Dialects said, could tell, Thy acquir'd pains had lam'd the miracle. Thy fruitful Tongues might far as day have run, To language Countreis to the posting Sun: The western Climes might have bin told by thee All that the Indian voic'd, Antiquitie. Nor is that all, for numerous speech affords, Without good conduct, but a Mart of words. A bunch of keyes men prize not wealth, but letts, Where skill comes short t'unlock the cabinets. A magazine of sounds in most we see Serve but to stuff and perfect Pedantrie. Thy copiousness of Tongues findes matter hence, It lets in matter that conveyes new sense. And rat'st thy painted words embroideries, But as they usher strange discoveries. That East Idolatry yet had lurk'd 'tis ods But for thy subject of the Syrian gods. The world had still in ignorance bin held How great she was, had Selden not reveal'd Those pompous Attributes, Titles of renown Which King, Prince, Emperor challeng'd as their own. Earles &amp; Marquesses, Dukes &amp; all degrees Hence found them boundes fix'd for precedencies. A structure so elaborate it would ask Europe's joynt labour to out-goe the task. The Law of Nations 'mongst the Hebrews taught, And Nature's dictates where could we have sought But from that labour'd Piece is publish'd forth To leave the world a Legacy of thy worth. I name not others thy choice rarities, The Hebrew Priests, defence of British Seas, A rundles marbles, and the Hebrew wife, Thy Sanhedrims Tripartite, Edmer's life, With other choice which I not reckon here, Least so the hidden embers I should stir Of rancor gone in some, who measure test Not by their judgment, but their interst. Such as wit-bound themselves can faintly spare To stab with censures, other choicest care. Such suburb-wits their shackied judgments binde To reach the bark, and dwell upon the rinde. When 'twas thy excellence to pursue y? chase, Till there was left to scruple no more place. So long Alcides thought his work unsped, As he to Hydra left or tayle or head. Thy Plummet sinks into the depest sound, Still plunging onward till it finde y? ground. What worn inscriptions didst from dust relieve? And from time's shipwrack didst restore to live? Custom, or Manners, Ensigne, Form, or Rite, What is't thy teeming brain not brought to light? Now thou hast travell'd through the world's wide coast, And left no creek, nor path, nor Seas uncrost, And nature's utmost boundaries hast known, Twas time thou tookst y? period of thine own. That so thy wakeful soul dismantled hence Might meet fresh objects for Intelligence The Grecian Heroe thus when he went through As far as bounds, wish'd he had more to doe. So through feirce seas the angry keel is hurl'd To look out passage to another world. J.U. M.A. J.C. Oxon. Upon the incomparable Learned John Selden. Twere wrong to thy great name on thee to write, Who like the Sun shines best with thy own light. Clocks that are made to imitate the Sun Seldom run right and true in motion With heaven's great torch; whose course is regular And tells us our best acts erroneous are. Our praise, when best improv'd, is at this stay As our faint twilight's to the bright mid-day. All we can speak comes so far short of thee As doth of nature our Philosophie. In thine own sphear thrice glorious star then shine; Since all our light is but a beam from thine. The spotless ray originally springs From the great mass of light, more splendor brings Than when through ayre's dark Medium it reflects, Where not so pure a beam the sun projects. So the first shade some glasses doe present More vigor hath than to the next is lent. Thus Pictures from their excellence doe fal The further off from their Originall. Upon the death of John Selden. Praise that is worthy thee who would rehearse Must dare beyond the skill of art, or verse. 'Twere sawciness here least flattery for to use, Where to the nine the ayd of a tenth Muse Is all too little to proclaime thy worth, Who art no comet blazing seldom forth, But a new Star, us mortals for to tell Thou wert from heaven sent a miracle. Since then none may presume to reach thy fire, We may be thought no trespassers to admire. Thus when we view stars that are far above Tis no crime such (if not to catch) to love. Let others speak thy richness by whole sale Twill us suffice to mention by retayle. Twas but the least among thy lasting pains To purge our Laws from errors, &amp; the stains That long had dwelt on them to wash away, By Duried Fleta's resurrection day. Time's ruind monuments, records out of date And rolls which ages past expos'd to fate, Thou with such wondrous artifice didst revive; Twas not recovery, but new life didst give. As if those caracters year'd to dust and death Hadst re-instated with new soul and breath. And though on living men tis seldom seen That men contemporarie pass a due esteem; But when the carkass is dissolv'd to dust Envy gives then what to the dead is just. Yet was it said of Selden, none beside, That he was stamp'd authentick ere he dy'd. For tis Truth's voice, at Bar when thou stoodst by Thy self was cited for Authority. I want both pen and utterance to declare How great a Master shin'st, how singular In the deep insight of the Common Laws, There's none make scruple to give thee the Bayes. And when 'midst throng of business did a rise Some sturdy doubts, unfathom'd misteries. Unto the Hive Statists would soon repair, Who best of Statists didst deserve the chair. Laws y? were forreign were so much thy own, They were not more unto their natives known. Civil and Canon knew'st all Kingdoms ore, Yea all that ages past did know before. As if the Sun and thou tri'd Masterie, Whether more Countries did, or Kingdoms see; Joynt tenants of the world, for both have gone Thy daily circle, both annual have run, Phœbus aim'd not more secrecies to know Than our great Selden made his Title to. More I could say the grandiure of your praise Swels like a torrent on, nor can I raise A Mound against it. Let this Eulogie Serve for inscription then, that were each eye Turn'd to a Sun the round world to survey We should despair to finde, Selden like thee; Like Cæsar's Amphitheatre never was Is an Hyperbole that Poets pass. But we shall keep on modest bounds of fame, To say like thee nere sprung there such a frame. Degenerate Love and Choyce. Mad Heretick forbear to say or swear That there is such a Meteor as love here. Tis true; when Adam in that perfect state Of life, first went on wooing for a Mate, Twas pure affection that his soul did catch And love conjoin'd with God made the best match. Vertue, not portion was the aim he sought, For Eve had scarce a smock t'her back tis thought. But when once Love and Adam were exil'd Eden, Love soard to heaven, and man grew wilde. And as his knowledg and that nobler light He first received, were mufled up in night, Then Avarice and ambition seiz'd the heart And faculties depraved in every part. Hence 'twas he tugg'd and travell'd to restore That bless'd eternity he lost before. As though when he fell mortal, God had hid The Tree of life in earth, which he forbid. Hence, hence he grip'd at lands, and moths, &amp; rust, And a large name deep written in y? dust. Thus the blinde sons of men, as real heirs Of his corruptions, drew their father's cares And guilt in with their first breath, which sublime And are intens'd in the decayes of time. Thus matches took the High Cross, and of old That golden age became an age of gold. Hagling relations did their issues joyn, Not to make Good, but to exalt the Line; And horse-course of their children at a rate Ordain'd by them, not by the hands of fate. And therefore Phillip's Asse laden with Oar Shall sooner take Olynthe, than of yore Those royal Macedonians, whose high parts Lost their esteem against such sordid hearts. If the fine thing with fancies ribboned, And the gay tuft of feathers on his head, (That perfect emblem of its empty brain) Come rumbling with a Coach &amp; dagled train Of snaph?ce-vouchers; can just smack its h?d, And call to read the catalogue of his land; Run, hold &amp; keep: For this, this, this is hee, That storms, &amp; takes &amp; routs where ere he be. To this Diana streight the Ephesians bow: Or; squeez the wax; no matter where, nor how, So the revenue &amp; the joynture's great; Tis never queston'd whether by Escheat, Theft, or Disseisin, or the Orphan's tears It were extorted and grew basely theirs. But like the Israelites in the Devil's behalf. Forsake God to adore the goodly Calf. Then for that pretty trifle, that sweet fool, Just wean'd from's bread &amp; butter &amp; y? school; Cracknuts &amp; Hobbihorse, &amp; y? quaint Jackdaw, To wear a thing with a plush Scabberd—law; Whose Father's low-roof'd late-hatch'd Scutcheon can Scarce speak him Saped into a gentlemam. Though at his great expence his armes took date Last circuit from y? Herauld's poor estate. Like a feirce Countrey Ale-house that renues His Licence every Sessions, and so brewes. But this swayes not the ballance: He has it That's Vertue, Gallantry, &amp; Worth, and Wit, All truss'd up in a bag, and more yet to't, For he that buyes him has the Pigg to boot. And though he cannot speak sense, let it goe, He offers at it, or else means it so. His worship's will was good. If he incline To any vice, as Swearing, Whores, or Wine; Tis Courage, Youth's fling, or a merry Cup, Such imperfections soon are sodred up. If otherwise a clown; tis modestie. Or simply lavish, tis good nature. Wee Have vizards of all sizes, small or large, If's greatness please but to be at the charge. Thus Riches which were made man's slave to bee, Have robb'd him of his native soveraigntie. And captive beauties, like fair Barks long lost, Are put to sale by th'Candle, who gives most. Whiles Love and Honour languish at the door, Most glorious pittied fancies, prais'd and poor. But here yee groveling Muck-worms, yee that build Like Ants in Mole-hills; &amp; tye field to field; Which varying God's decree, by joyning hands, Instead of marrying Children, wed your lands. Tis true, you may pretend a busied care In the advance and Tilting of an Heir: And plausibly too; were the structure layd Upon a noble bottom; humble, stayd, Religious grace and worth met &amp; combin'd With th'active vigour of a gallant minde; This were a pure c?nexion, sweet with good, A heightning and refining of the bloud. But the hog-trough wordlings from these measures flirt, They love a great name though it's made of dirt; To which the children are th'forc'd Seals and Signes Of ship-wrack'd free-will in their Fathers loins. The liberty of choice is quite flung by With a Proviso of new property. That primitive capacity of love Which the all-seeing diety from above Had plac'd in the sweet cabinet of the brest Is now expuls'd by man, and dispossest. Upon which breach Lust made an enterance there W?? spreads its wide infection every where. Come Worlding let me undeceive thee now. If man's grand welfare hangs upon y? plough; Or if there be eternity in pelf And earth, that is as mortal as thy self; Then thou hast grasp'd to purpose. But if not, The end of wealth's mistaken in thy plot. Where much is given, much required shal bee. Not what was left to thy posterity; Or the by-issues of thy younger years; But how &amp; when thou stop'dst the widdowes tears With timely charity; and reliev'dst the poor With ready morsels frost-bound at thy door. These are y? works &amp; friends shall follow thee, The rest shall live thy shame or infamie. Nor would I have thy off-spring cast away Upon each roving wit, that shall essay Thy hopeful lovely viands, with pretence Of some blinde far-hence-travell'd eminence. Nor that unrighteous Mammon swels thy chest And thee, let looss on every stragling guest. But there's a mean in judgment, a mid course, A difference betwixt a Man and's Horse. A fair distinction, were not we too nice, To moderate disdain and Market price. Forestal not then the world, but let all live; Some come to sell by weight, &amp; some to give, Love never measur'd by the Acre stood, If we toll fairly, then the bargain's good. A Dialogue between two water Nymphs Thamesis and Sabrina. Tha. Ho! all yee sister-streams that govern'd be. By great Diana's watry diety. Yee silver Nymphs that gliding sport and play, And kis your flowry bancks, and flowing stray In lofty murmurs, ô come sit you here, And lend my swelling grief a voice or tear. Sab. What poor afflicted Soul with mournful cries And sobs awakes my long benighted eyes? What hapless maid of her first love bereav'd Bemoans her friend in death's black armes received? Perhaps some pining Votress in y? dark Bedews a Lover's tombe with tears; hark! hark! Tha. Ah me forlorn! ah me forsaken maid! Where is my loveliness and honour strayd? Those glories dwelt upon me? &amp; those swans That sung my name beyond proud Ganges sands, And fill'd both Indies with the wide renown Of my spread fame? Now tost now tumbled down? Sab. I thought my crimson streams had buried all The bitter land-flouds of a Kingdoms thrall. But lo! a louder eccho living is, A floud of yet continued miseries. A tide of wo at last has found a tongue To bear a sad part in my doleful song: Speak wretched Maid, whence art?— Tha. —tis I, tis I, Poor Thamesis out of my ruines cry, Gravell'd with sorrow and scortch'd up with heat Of war, struck deaf with drums, who was the seat Of peace and plenty, now the rouling map Of violence and tyranous mishap. Sab. Alas fair Princess! were there left in mee A Creek reserv'd from grief to pitty thee, With what swift hast should I divert y? course Of my salt waves to mixt their scatter'd force With that vast body of thy tears? And close My springs with thine to make a sea of woes? Tha. Can there be such a monster that dares own It's small undoing when my mischief's shown? O can there be proportion 'twixt the drops Of private ills, and the full plenteous crops And buckets of mine anguish? O forbear! I drank those showers whereof thy storms skirts were. Sab. We grant (Great Lady of the Isles) that thy Tumultuous tumours were that pluresie That caus'd the opening of our veins. Thy head Distemper'd, we grew soon imbodied In the same gulf and ocean of thy pain, Languishing rivulets of thee the maine. But if the surges of thy bosom have Digg'd for thy beauty an untimely grave: If thy rash waters have so run thee in The winding gyres and streights of suffering; Thank thy Augean filthiness for these, Thy Hydra which hath slain thy Hercules. Tha. Tis true Sabrina I have acted right The fable of y? Horse; who needs would fight The Hart: But finding streight himself to bee Too weak for his Pallizadoed enemie; He begs the man to ride him, and became His slave, to gain an empty victor's name. Sab. No, rather I suppose th'hast verefi'd The story of the Frogs, that to Jove cry'd To have a King. He heard their praiers tis said And flung them down a Beam to be their head. But they dislik'd with peace, again did call, On which he sent a Stork that eat them all. So thou y? kick'st at quiet kings, hast gain'd A conquest, w?? now rides thee double rein'd. Thou, thou that shrunk'st at puny Subsidies Art eas'd at length with Taxes and Excize; Hast only chang'd the names of things y? Hague For Amsterdam, the Meazles for the Plague. Tha. Crush not Sabrina now my smarting sores, But let the offring of my crumbled Towers, And rubbish Palaces appease thy feirce Censure: For lo I speak but in my hearse. This issue of my breath's a parting groan: Add not affliction to affliction. Sab. Nor has y? burden lighted all on thee Alone sweet Nymph, but Humber, Trent &amp; Dee, Medway, and my poor channel had their share In th'crimson streams of a most bloudy war. If by the shore the Publick Father dy'd Twas not long since the Son here slipp'd a side? Sav'd by a miracle of Providence, The finger of the Gods, that caught him hence From out y? jaws of death, to make him more Than that fight gain'd could seal him conquerour. But least I lessen thy deserts, ô take The glory of our ruine for thy sake. Tha. Twas I indeed was that main spring of all That set the judgments moving, w?? did fall, And in each quarter of the land did roam, But now again are justly travell'd home Through my own bowels. O my pride and purse Were both at once the Countrie's &amp; my curse. Fulness of bread, &amp; wantoness, that brat Of sweet abused peace, in me begat A nicety of palate, a desire Of novelties, and setting all on fire, Which flame once kindled, I was forc'd to be The Fuel of my own calamitie. Sab. And rightly, since thou wast y? wombe and well From whence those Spirits rose, to be their Hell. The high throne of that many headed Beast Popular Soveraignty: A snaky nest And Synagogue of Asps, which share the sweat Of three tame Nations tyed up from their meat. Tha. What th? Sabrina rests yet to be done? But that we shun with shame and fly the sun, Suffring a willing winter to congeal Our drops to christal, which wee'le mildly deal In softer showers of pious tears again Till we have purg'd a scarlet Kingdoms stain. The Myrtle Grove. Just as the reeling Sun came sliding down Among the Moors and Tethys in a Gown Of sea-green watchet settled to embrace Her great Apollo from his circled race, And y? streak'd heavens did themselves digest Into a larger Iris, to invest And canopie th'illustrious lovely pair In a Diaphanous Robe of costly ayre: Clarinda rose amidst the Myrtle Grove, Like the Queen-mother of the stars above. But that Clarinda's was no borrow'd Light, Nor could it, where she was be deemd a night. Such was the natural glories she put on They ow'd no being to reflection. Whiles the inspir'd Musicians of the wood, Ravish'd at the new day, powr'd out a floud Of quavering melody in honied strains To court the glittering Diety of the plains. Those pretty flow'ry beds of sweets that now Had clos'd their heads up in an amber dew Of tears, to mourn the drowsy Sun's good night, Warm'd with a nobler ardor sprung up right, And threw the mantles of dull sleep aside In a displaid and meritorious pride, To strew with rich perfumes her balmy way, Which grew more fragrant by her active ray. Thus sweetly woo'd Clarinda laid her down On a curl'd quilt of roses, fondly grown Proud of their own oppression, whiles they may Kiss the dear burden w?? upon them lay. Then skreen'd with harmony, she stretch'd a long Upon her Damask Couch, where a bright throng Of Graces hover'd ore the firmament Of her pure orbs drawn to a full extent. Whiles a soft gale of wanton wind that blew Did sport her willing glories into view. But I poor dazled I, not daring here T'attempt the splendor of each naked sphear, Stood peeping through the Opticks of y? shade, Which to my sight a kind reflection made. Her eyes half shut up in their christal case Stood twinckling Centinels upon her face; Or else to take the prospect of those fields Of beauty which that flowing Tempe yields. Her coral lips ten thousand smiles enthron'd, Like clustred grapes which for a vintage groan'd. The Ivory palace of her stately neck Cloth'd with majestick aw, did seem to check The looser pastime of her gamesome hair, Which in wilde rings ran trick about the ayre. Her amorous brests swell'd to a lovely rise Of dripping plenty a twinn'd Paradise Of milk and honey, exhal'd my roving eye Into a soul-ensnaring extasie. And had I not recoil'd without delay I there had wandred in the milky way. Her belly like the Ace of Clubs, so white, So black, the struting pillow of delight, So fired the catching tinder of my sense, That I no longer Student could commence, But streight weigh'd anchor &amp; tack'd up y? sail To the main yard, waiting a stiffer gale To pass me through those ticklish streights of Man Into the full Mediterranean. At last I plung'd into th'Elysian charms, Fast claspp'd by th'arched Zodiack of her arms Those closer clings of love, where I pertaked Strong hopes of bliss; but so, ô so I waked! To my honoured friend Mr. T. C. that ask'd mee how I liked his Mistris being an old widdow. But prethee first how long hast bin Lost in this sad estate of sin? That the milde Gout, or Pox, or worse Serves not to expiate thy curse? Some Pestilence else may be thought upon, And not such absolute damnation. Are rocks and halters grown so dear That there's no perishing but here? Doe no Committee yet survive Those cheaper Gregories of men alive? If thou wilt needs to Sea, ô must it bee In an old Galliasse of sixty three? A snail-crawl'd botom? A gray Bark That stood at Font for Noah's Ark? Whose wrinkled Poop in figures furl'd Describes her travels round the world? A Nut, w?? wh? th'hast crack'd &amp; fumbled ore Thou'lt finde the Squiril has bin there before? Then raise the Siedge from falling on That old dismantled garrison. Rash Lover speak what pleasure hath Thy Spring in such an Aftermath? Who, were she to the best advantage spread, Is but the dull husk of a maiden head. How canst thou then delight the sense In beautie's preterperfectense? And dote upon that free-stone face Which wears but the records of grace? Whose antick Monast'ry brags but a Chest Of venerable Reliques at the best? O can there such a famine bee Of piping hot virginitie, That thou art forc'd to slur and cheat Thy stomack with the broken meat? Why he that wooes a Widdow does no more Then court that Quagmire where one sunk before. Fie, prize not then those Arras Looks Sullied and thumb'd like Town-hall Books! I like thy fancy well to have Its misery so near its Grave. And tis a general shrift that most men use, But yet tis tedious waiting dead mens shoes. If 'twere thy plot I do confess For to make Mummee of her grease, Or swop her to the Paper Mill, This were extracting good from ill. But if thou wed'st on any worse condition, Thou'lt prove Delinquent for thy Superstition. But prethee hold, let me advise, Perhaps shee's rich and seems a prize, New chalk'd, new rigg'd, a stately Friggot, But yet she's tapp'd at lower spiggot. Yet if no med'cine for thy grief be found, There's smal ods Tom 'twixt being hang'd or drown'd. The Engagement Stated. Begon Expositor: The Text is plain No Church, no Lord, no Law, no Soveraign. Away with mental reservations, and Senses of Oaths in files out-vy the Strand. Here's hell truss'd in a thimble, in a breath, Dares face the hazard of the second death. The Saints are grown Laconians, and can twist Perjury up in pils like Leyden grist, But hold precize Deponents: Though the heat Of Zeal in Cataracts digests such meat, My cold concoction shrinks, and my advance Drives slowly to approach your Ordinance. The signe's in Cancer, and the Zodiack turns Leonick, rowl'd in curls while Terra burns. What though your fancies are sublim'd to reach Those fatal reins? Success and will can teach But rash divinity. A sad renown Where one man fell to see a million drown. When neither Arts nor Arms can serve to fight And rest a Title from its law and right, Must malice piece the Trangum? &amp; make clear The scruple? Else we will resolve to swear? Nay out swear all that we have sworn before And make good lesser crimes by acting more, And more sublime? This, this extends y? Line And shames the puny soul of Cataline. On this account all those whose fortune's crost, And want estates, may turn Knights of the Post. Vaulx we out vy'd thee, since thy plot fell lame, We found a closer Cellar for the same, Piling the fatall Powder in our mouths Which in an Oath discharg'd blew up the House. Maugre Mounteagle, asps not throughly slain Their poison in an age may live again. Good Demas cuff your Bear, then let us see The mistery of your iniquitie. May a man course a cur? And freely box The Question? Or the formal paradox? But as in Phisick so in this device This querk of policy the point is nice. For he that in this model means to thrive, Must first subscribe to the preparative. Like Witches compacts counter-march his faith, And soak up all what ere the Spirit saith: Then seal and sign. Scylla threw three bars short, He had a sword indeed, but no Text for't. Old Rome lament thy infancy in sin, We perfect what thou trembled'st to begin Blush then to see thy self out done. But all The world may grieve tis epidemical. Heaven frownes indeed. But what makes hell enraged? Sweet Pluto be at peace, we have Engaged. FINIS.</field>
