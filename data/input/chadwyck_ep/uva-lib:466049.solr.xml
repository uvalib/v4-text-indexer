      <field name="fulltext">COMMANDERS IN CHIEF THE General seemed to hear the guns as, warily and slow, He moved his paper soldiers from a paper Continent. A rosebud in his buttonhole laughed softly. Long ago HER legions took the British Isles with nothing but a scent! HOPEFUL GARDENING OF bushes plant the laurel most, And near to miracle remain; For none can tell when Daphne's ghost Will leap to lovely flesh again. THE WISH WOULD God that I could be A little more each day The better man I see Part showing in my clay! THE MIMIC OF all the excellent mimics I know There is none can touch Sleep's masterly act: Just look at this girl with the face of snow And the hands crossed over the breast! Exact! LIFE THIS chemist in his famous cup May mix some nasty fluids up, Yet even while we call him cheat He laughs and passes us a sweet. THE LAST DOSE âTAKE it!â said the SPECIALIST, âTake it, for you must! Gone the hyacinth valley, gone the naked heath. Now, and for the last time, dignify your dustâ COWARDS let the wineglass rattle on their teeth!â JUDAS REMEMBERING Judas, darkly sealed To wound the side has never healed, We know his heart must be a heaven If Heaven by him can be forgiven. ISAAC SINCE God was kind to him, and caught The threatening knife from Abraham, I hope the little Hebrew thought To beg a favour for the ram. THE TESTIMONIAL IN Death's old heart that, cool and placid, Tick by tick with the Cosmos goes There's more of mellow and less of acid Than anybody knows. THE GOOD FORTUNE A SOUR-FACED monkey, long unchecked, Was grumbling at the monkey-plan. At last his aunt said, âRecollect, You might have been a man!â THE DEVOTEE THIS girl's a piece of music being played Above the devilish discord of the town, Fingered by Angels Christianly arrayed, Who keep the pedal of holiness always down. A TRUTH WAVE farewell, and cross the seas, Would you learn, as far you roam, How to find Hesperides On the map of home. THE HEROINE WHILE Wealth was a-squandering, Poverty set To work in a fashion enthusiastic To juggle with bellies and parings, and get A farthing to stretch like a piece of elastic. THE VALLEY âI MUST not wear too broad a smile,â said Earth, âOr humankind at once will deem me simple.â Thereat, by way of dignifying mirth, She cradled in her cheek this lovely dimple. THE RUNNERS BE it mine to view the course, with looks As bright as heaven-haunted brooks, When Spring is watching from her bower The race between the Leaf and Flower. THE BUDDING HERO BEHOLD him at the Raleigh age, Red in the cheeks with England's story, And almost weeping if a page Fails of the signature of Glory! BAD TASTE ATTACK him with your beauty! Throw Beneath his feet your limbs of snow! 'Tis vain. What curves shall give him zest Whose tidbit is the mouldering breast? CUI BONO? OFTEN I wonder, when I read the tale Of how the pigs went headlong to the brine, If at his visible ruin the man turned pale Who chanced to own the herd of Gadarene swine. THE FOLLY GOD said, âUse this lovely place, Children, for your rambles.â Hardly had He turned His face Ere it reeked like shambles. THE CHESS MASTERS DEATH, staring darkly at the pieces spread Upon the board, felt suddenly elated; For, as he looked ten thousand moves ahead, He saw how Life at last could be checkmated. THE GIPSY REMEMBERING Hagar, cast away While Ishmael yet on her bosom lay, Lend me your ragged ends of shire, With a cony or two for the pot on the fire. THE WRONG TURNING THEY reached a forking road, and Man Branched off, to be a peer or flunkey; But very soon his heart began To think the luck was with the Monkey. HOUSEWIFE CORN THE dough being ready, the housekeeper takes Beams of the sun as her coals, Then borrows an overn from August, and bakes Millions of little brown rolls. THE THORN TO THE ROSE HONOURED art thou in every land, And I as much oppressed; Yet I have only pricked the hand, Whilst thou hast torn the breast. THE REBEL THOUGH Frost is Winter's bondman for all time, What's left in him of warmness so rebels That on our windowpane he draws in rime A ghostly Spring of ferns and flowery bells. THE SCOURGE LOOK at his open sores! Dispel Both rage and pity â if you can. How shrewd a blow on horsekind fell When God invented man! THE AFTER-LIFE BE you certain of this: You shall seldom ride In the bay with your lubberly canvas furled, But shall creakingly out to the toss of the tideâ There are herrings to catch! 'Tis a workaday world! DARK LOOK at me quickly, then turn away, And I seem as black as the swarthy coal; But run to my lullaby heart to stay, And watch how brightly I nurse my soul! THE HANDICAP THE doom of Eden's thrilling skies Was known to God ere worlds began, And Adam lost his paradise Before he breathed the breath of man. A PICTURE OF LAZINESS AFRICA sings in a pear-tree; Ceylon Breathes in a cup on a book of romances; Egypt is burning; I loll in the sun, Begging the Gulf Stream to water my pansies! THE CAT ALTHOUGH she thinks that busy man Builds lofty dwellings for her ease, She snubs him at the Vatican And flouts him in the Tuileries. SACRILEGE IN honour of the Prince of Peace, The opposing generals say That bloody butcherings shall cease Till dawn on Boxing Day. THE QUESTION LOVELY of hair and breast and face, Utterly lost to Christian grace, How will you lift that bankrupt head When all the butterfly beauty's dead? BACK TO THE LAND SAID Decay to himself, âHuman beings are right. I am thankful these noodles at last understand That the world they have spoilt will go perfectly right When the whole of their race has gone BACK TO THE LAND.â MILLIONAIRES THE millionaires have uses. Even these Are crooked ways of help, be sure. Behold, they drive us to our knees To thank God for the poor! A DISCOVERY WHEN I grew strong, I quickly found My weakness; for my power was less Than when I crawled along the ground In childhood's strength of strengthlessness. THE CONSEQUENCE WHEN Eve from duty turned away, How small the prize, how large the loss! The hand that robbed the apple-spray Transfixed our Saviour on the Cross. PRISON FARE THEY tell me Life's a prison. Granted! But there are flowers and birds and dew. I'd pick a million miles of oakum For such a gaol of green and blue! TO A MISERLY LANDOWNER OUT with your loaded purse, and stand To help the weariful passer-by! 'Tis strange for one so rich in land To be so very poor in sky. THE STALWART âKILL me the ox!â roared Vice in tones That shook, as thunder shakes, the quiet; âFor I should soon be skin and bones On Virtue's vegetarian diet!â THE INDIGNANT ONION ROSE AMONG ROOTS R. L. Stevenson. he called me. Well, The madman must have lost his nose! I trust I have the grace to smell Far sweeter than a stinking rose! THE TORTURERS THERE is a sound of hammers always reaching From earth to heaven; for hourly, to their loss, Some so-called Christians, blasphemously preaching By lips, not hearts, nail Jesus to the Cross. THE FIRST CROCUS WHEN out of Heaven Prometheus brought The fire to Earth, he dropped a spark; And where it tumbled, Nature wrought A fire-filled crocus for a mark. A SISTER OF THE POOR HER bosom is a belfry. Hark! She rings an octave clear and sweet For many a soul that feels too dark To fall in tears at Jesu's feet. THUNDER FLAT fall the oak-trees in the grove, Rivers disperse and mountains crack, When leap-frog is the game, and Jove From broad-beamed Vulcan takes a back. THE REVERSAL IF you would be a groundling, keep The maxim, LOOK BEFORE YOULEAP; But if a hero, Valour's Book Advises, LEAP BEFORE YOU LOOK! THE REASON âBECAUSE these fools,â the Earthquake said, âRegard themselves as perfect models, I have at times to leave my bed To shake such nonsense from their noddles.â IN A CEMETERY FOR countless centuries revolve With Earth these dead by Death destroyed. I would to God that I might solve THIS Problem of the Unemployed! THE SWORD I DID but hint myself to man In the long, sharp leaf, And, changed to a devil, he foamed, and ran To embrace his grief. PERCHANCE HE who underneath this stone No longer hears the bruised world moan, By being deaf to Earth may hear The anguish of another sphere. A BAD RECORD A WORLD of pathos lies in thisâ That out of all the lower creatures There's only one content to kiss Our hands and search in love our features. THE SAME COMPLAINT âWHAT your most vexing parasite,â Bawled Earth to Mars, âsince Life began?â Mars roared an answer through the night In emphasis of thunder, âMan!â A MODERN TYPE SHE clutched the doctor's arm, and eyed The newborn babe with petulance: âNow mind you get me well,â she cried, âBefore the Digby-Jones's dance!â SHORT SIGHTED WHILE Virtue kept her ancient grace She was truly Queen of the Moral Lasses; But how she ruined her lovely face When she took to wearing glasses! DEPARTED SHE died on Easter Tuesday. Being tired, She limped along till she was out of School. May she be welcomed as a soul desired, And her discoveries all be beautiful! CONQUERING WOMAN WHILE troopers were lusty with swords and spears, And generals deep in the craft of their duty, She vanquished a couple of hemispheres By drawing an inch of the bodkin of beauty. A PERSONAL MATTER TOO old at forty! Venomous jibe For the brain that feels like fruit in the sun! If this be the fate of the Mellowing Tribe, Each man of the Tribe was too old at one! THE QUIBBLE âHE forbade us to pluck, you remember, Madam, 'Tis better to leave it alone,â said Adam. âBut, my love, it's a WINDFALL!â the woman protested. So the pippin was munched, and the husband was bested. MYSELF TO MYSELF WHAT skies! What flowers! I feel in you Your heart as frolic as a colt. Beware! From just as clear a blue There crashed that unforgettable bolt! A BAD EXAMPLE IF in the firmament at night For homely lessoning you seek, Beware the silver satellite That never turns the other cheek. LAZARUS THOU had'st to pay a fee to Death Ere coming back to mortal reach: Methinks the price he charged for breath (Shrewd bargainer!) was loss of speech. CITY SPIDERS THE insect came from its web, to crawl Where the human insect sat and spied: Smudging it dead with his thumb on the wall, He committed the horror of fratricide. A PESSIMIST TO THE WORLD I AM weary to death of your noisy ado, And 'tis plain as the sun we can never agree: I shall thankfully finish my business with you When you heartily finish your business with me. DISTANT RELATIVES I WATCHED her coming. Unaware of fault, I raised my cap and smiled to Susie March. Lot's wife, if you remember, changed to salt, But Sue (the little cat!) had turned to starch. VARIANCE AT FORTY âTURN!â cried the brain. âI am weary of the mountain.â âClimb!â quoth the heart. âWe are only half way up. Throw a vision to the peak! And I will be a fountain Pouring red refreshment in our master's shaking cup.â THE DUET LOVELY and Lovable, if yesterday My rendering seemed to fail in merit, Forgive me! Flesh must sometimes play A little out of tune with Spirit. A HINT CATERPILLAR, you ought to try To mend your manners! Butterfly, 'Tis sad when near relations pass Without a nod in sky or grass. CONCEIT THOUGH many Christians coldly turn From much that Christ would have them learn, Be sure they hotly claim as theirs His pearls of price. Conceited heirs! THE TEMPEST BY the breves and the titan sharps in a swarm Long was his mood conveyed: On a fiddle of earth with a bow of storm, Jove! how the fiddler played! RENUNCIATION SINCE it were well for me to rise A hero over fire and feast, Veil in thy hair those star-sent eyesâ She loves me best who loves me least. UNSEXED BEGIN my shroud! Stitch, stitch away, And bring it me home this very day; For English schoolboys, soft as doves, Snowball (Great Hercules!) in gloves. FINIS</field>
