      <field name="fulltext">Vultus Apellinea pictus Barone tubella est Lotus Apollinea pingitur arte liber. John Hobart Gent: Uelle proposse. TO THE SUPEREMINENT PARAGON OF ART, AND Literature, the truly noble James Howell Esquire, Nestors Longævity and both worlds Felicity. On his beloved friend the Authour, and his ingenious Cyprian Academy. Noe sooner in our Inne, but out in Print! Sure 'tis Arts Arcademy, and the Muses Mint: Where in Dame Nature Pupill is to Art; Bearing Minerva's Image in each part: The Court of Pallas and the Muses Throne; Where Ignoramus stands outlaw'd alone. Baron, goe, non suit momus; for's barren plea Against the Court; and tell him openly; The braine of Iupiter's each Courtiers Mother: Or bid him reade thy booke; and then thinke other. Me thinks I see the world thy booke admire; And Ladies dandling it with much desire To see that hand; these flowrie Pastrolls pen'd; And wish them Ring-like, without any end. What Uenus can denie to be the Fem', Of Laureat Baron; borne of Orpheus stem; None can object against thy worth, or line; Save more then Bigamie with the Nine: Pernassu's thine! make joynture then; And let God Hyemen say Amen. To Court th' art welcome; th' Muses blaze thy Prayse: Momus shall weare the Ivy; Thou the Bayes. William Beversham of Grayes Jnne Esquire. To his much respected and learned friend Master Robert Baron on his Booke. Should my poore Muse presume to speake Encom'ums in thy praise, Amazement soone 'would strike her dumbe Whilst she beheld thy rayes: Yet give her leave, though that she can't Add splendor to thy name With her black spotts to shadow out Thine ever sparkling fame. Thy booke sweet friend doth seeme to me A Royall treasury. Thou Baron of Minerva's rich Exchequer term'd mayst be Heer's Pallas Palace, or White-Hall Thy workes a glor'ous feast Which would invite from Helicon The pretty Nymphs to tast. Here may be seene a Table deck't Vpon Parnassus hill. Here may be heard Apollo's harpe With its harmon'ous shrill. Here Nectar pure from Helicon Like raine from clouds doth showre; More sweetnesse doth each sentence yeeld Then the Hyblæan floure. Each gallant here may have his fill Each Lady please her eye Such are thy streames of eloquence Such is thy poesie. Did th' Epicure thy banquet tast He soone would Bacchus scorne And now corrouse full cups out of Thine Amelthean horne: For surfetting or giddinesse Here is no neede to feare Minerva's guests scarce ever knew The heresie of beere. Let Poets feigne unto themselves An Aganippe fount Or Muses sacred place, yet still Thy booke doth them surmount. Cease Criticks then to tell my muse Of other Helicon Heer's Pallas wine, her glory tis That shee may sip thereon. Robert Brounrigg, of Grayes Inne Gent. To my chosen Friend, the hopefull Mr. Baron. So young! and write so well! it might appeare Impossible but that thy name is there Nature hath here her former selfe surpast, Shewing at once perfection and hast: Since thou like Virgills Genethliack bay Art a tall tree, ere time could thinke a spray. Well might thy happy lovers wish to come From th' Checquer shades of their Elizium, And suffer further miseries so they might Engage so rich a pen to give them light; For nothing was so well performd as writ, Such is the wide Prerogative of wit. Thy Booke and Picture contradictions tell, And thwart themselves into a Miracle. J: Hall. é Soc: Gray. hosp. Gent. To his ever Honoured Friend Mr. Robert Baron upon his Cyprian Academy. How dare I venter to insert a line Before thy booke, when every word of thine Doth swell it selfe with a strong winded blast Of rich embroderd Eloquences, what wa'st Not fraid of choaking in their bringing out. Or didst not bord with Lessius about Some 9 months since conception, and didst there With in thy throate make a full passage cleere To give them birth? what Midwife hadst at hand? Came not Minerva with Apollo man'd Merc'ry attending (in his proper place Most sweetly sings a fift and eight's the base) Dect with his wings, even hoarse in setting forth Thy new lict Fætus with its unknowne worth. Her'e is a Chimist which from a rude masse Extracts Elixar that death may well surpasse Spencers ninth Canto in the fairy Queene, Or Ben's vulpony, oh had he but seene Thy pregnant fancy, how could he forebeare To rend his Cat'line and by Jove to sweare Thy'ns the better, thou scornst exoticke words Or Exolericke Phrases which affords No luster to thy booke, thy webs not drawne Or Spun of home-made thred, 'tis pure fitt lawne For Palace stockings, Th' Acromatick straines Surely are flowne from out Cylen'ns braines; Thy words carry charmes, able to lay wist The direfull magick of an Exorcist, Come Rhombus come I prethee pause a while Thy language is pedantick, her's a stile To Court a Lady in, away, away To Schole young Emperick and make no stay But come and learne to speake, to Court, to charme Th' obdurate Mistrisse in thy wanton arme. Hence all your Momus bratts leave off to fleere Away you Criticks which are wont to Jeere, Or else King Arthur with his Knights shall come And Robin Hood shall strike his paper drum In his defence, brave Guy shall bring a long St. George for England with a warlick throng Famous Parismus and Primalcon, Palm'rin D'oliua with Montelion: Cease now Antiquity T'hang weeping ore Brave Sydnys vrne invest thy selfe no more With sable weeds, he livs, for sure there is Of Souls a sam' an Metempsychosis, Is this not Sidney; marke his Veine in verse His stile in prose, I cannot here reherse His worth in severall arts, here Ptolomy Or Strabo may learne new Geography, Here Tycobrah may veiw the turning sphers Making still musick in his listning eares, Out of thy booke Euclid may learne to frame A sphere, or draw a paralellograme; But muse 'tis time to stop, dost thou not see Thou'rt o're guilty with Tautology; His booke shall praise it selfe, it may, nay can Suffice to make an English Uatican. Tho: Bradford To his honoured friend, Mr. Robert Baron upon his excellent Poem. Baron of Witt! 'tware sin to blazon forth, Vnder a meaner stile thy mighty worth: 'Tware but a trick of state if we should bring The Muses Lower house to vote thee King. Thou highly dost deserve it, and the bayes Should crown thy browes to thine immortall prayse While usher'd by the Graces thou art sent To sit as King ith' Poets Parliament. The famous Sidney's soule I think had gon A widow till the resurrection And never been inspir'd, now had not shee Found out her Match and been espous'd to thee. We have some things (call'd Poets) who although They nere were Verst but in the Crist-crosse-row And never swallow'd Possum thinke they're able, To be pertakers at the Muses Table. Who nere inspir'd with the thrice three-Sisters, But tooke their learning, as men doe their Glisters. And should you come and tell them what you lacke Their witts (like ware lost in a Pedlers packe They have, but know not where, perhaps their bundle May yeeld a Ballad for the widow-Trundle, Or some such businesse, wherein is shewn A mournefull ditty, to the pleasant tune. Fortune my Foe, or else-pox what d'ye call it When t'hath no more Concepit then has a Mallett. Who fr? their spungy braines may squeeze a sonnet When th'ave a Fortnight chew'd the cud upon it. But shall such clumsey Humours ever be Renouned with the name of Poetrye? No, 'twere a sin beyound a pardon You Deserve the Poets name and Laurell too. Thy booke swells high: thy lines well-wrought not weake Thy words might teach Apollo how to speake Which if he ever could have done, like Thee Daphne had ne're been turn'd into a Tree Thy twisted Plott so nice a hand hath spun, You'd sweare it were not only made, but done. And you would not beleeve me should I tell How soone this worke was done, when 'tis so well. Go on (deare friend) enlarge thy spreading fame And let thy Pen immortalize thy Name. Henry Bold Fell N. C. Oxon. To his ingenious friend Mr. Robert Baron upon his Cyprian Academy. I've thought upon't, yet faith I cannot tell Wether thy prose or verse doth most excell Each other, both in an Emphaticke style Roare like the torrent of a troubled Nile Stopp'd by an oblique beame thy words being pent I'th confin's of thy throate, did force, their vent To torture weake capacities, who'l say Reading thy book 'tis Greeke, wrote English way Nor is that all, some will conjecture by it That in'ts conception thou keep'st sparing diet They will not thinke thou did'st grosse Hamkins eat Least thou shouldst choake thy quibles with such meate Yet whatso'ere thou eat'st for other Palats They Orcheards apples yeild, thy gardens sallads. Well may Antiquitie amazed be To view their chapells, an Academy So farre out vie'd in which are many bowres For Venus darlings, neatly strow'd with flowers Of Rheth'rick, nay the seaven li'brall artes Like thunder-clapps doe act their severall parts In high expressions, which are forth brought Some of them sure stand for a thirteenth thought. But here I'le stoup, least I Tautologize In vaine ambages, when it will suffice That in worths plentuous cropps, of infant bayes I gleane an handfull to adorne thy prayse. John Gleane Cantabri. To his worthy friend upon his Excellent Book the Cyprian Academy. Natur's Apelles that canst thus the State Of Lovers with thy pencill adumbrate Come quit this spot, and mount the starry quire Where sit inshrin'd soules made of purest fire; Halfe shadow'd Venus shall then come to thee Hoping perfection in thy Poetry. The winged post of heaven shall guild his place Knowing thy Attick tongue can goe his pace. When Priam's Paris liv'd (hadst thou been borne, The godesses would thee their judge have sworne. Had Barclay seene thy booke, he would have said Vnhappy Argenis thou art betrayd. To riper witts, in deserts mayst thou be (Hating bright Sol) deform'd Nyctimine Let Satyrs now be packing, and that name That would eclipse the lustre of thy fame. What shall I give thee? such titles sure as these Amphitruo or Bombimachides. Mentfieur of Helicon, Marquis of the Mount Pernassus, and of the Cabaline fount Poets Collosse, under whose mighty feet May saile a greater then the Spanish Fleete To Loves Elizium, in stately boules Where heav'nly Nectar suck Platonick soules. I sweare by Venus and her turtle dove, He's like a Tartar that does not thee love. C. B. To his worthy Friend Mr. Robert Baron upon his excellent POEM. Let ancient Poets stand agast to see Themselves so farre out-run, out-stript by thee Minerva's Magazin, who hast not seen The third part of their yeares, nay scarce seventeen. Hither may ancients come, and grieve to see Their learning all Epitomiz'd in thee. Thy language is of proper words and phrase, What it affects it easily brings to passe, Were chast Penelope surviving now, Her stubborne heart it would make soone to bow. Cupid directs thy heart, thy pen Apollo, Or else such lofty straines thou couldst not swallow. Had'st thou not been in love, sure thou coul'st ne're Have writ such sublime raptures as are here. No more let Greece of famous Homer boast, No longer let old Ovids sacred goast Be grieved for, he now survives againe, Henceforth let dropping eyes cease, and amaine Let inke run from your quills in blazing forth This our inspir'd Poets praise and worth. I hold the opinion of Pithagoras, This Muse cannot be lesse then Ovids was, Onely it suffered a transmigration Into a body of a newer fashion. Vnto thy booke may all men have recourse, It doth descry the effects of love, the force Of armies and after victory the rest Which no man can so all as are exprest. In this thy booke Faminius his life Thou hast exprest together with his wife Clorinda, Poets vaile fayre Helens face Her's one indeede what she but painted was. Now lovers cease t'invoke and call upon God Pan for his sage direction In Nuptiall Hymnes, we scorne the common story This booke henceforth shall be our Directory, The prayses all to write should I accord Each line to me Encomiums would afford: But I have done, my pen is nought, and I Have but a slender vaine in poesie. Wherefore farwell, goe on as th' ast begun To make thy name more glorious then the sun. Thus wishing the each man a happy guest Unto thy booke I take my leave and rest. Tui amicissimus Joh. Quarles exæde S Petri Cantabridg. To my speciall Freind Mr. Robert Baron upon his ?????????????. Iewell of Nature whom a blessed age To us hath brought forth ev'n an Albion sage. Were't not obsurdity with silent quill To vaile in verse and propose thy Atick skill. Had a wise Sybill our Euriphilus But auguriz'd of thy approach to us Each hand had itched to be buisied In weaving Chaplets to adorne thy head. Criticks may now prejudicate, what though? They shew their envy, neither hurt they you, Minerva brought thee forth, Eupheme then The Muses nurse nurst thee the gem of men. Thou Ovid-like thou from thy infancy Brought'st this Heroick straine now shewne by thee. In which high tract thou Mars and Venus clere, Thou Neptune also dost demonstrate heare. Thee Mars in field may justly generall, Thee Neptune may by sea vice admirall Insert: Thee Venus in her lofty state, May make her amorous associate. Now hither may resort most antique sages Incredulous that these our iron ages A Phænix should produce, t'is true, and sure Natures best fabrick now within us indure. If these but wits first blossomes are, what then May be expected from thy riper pen. In this faire roade proceede we thee desire That as thy youth, we may thine age admire. Charles Cremer. Cantabr. To his much esteemed Friend Mr Robert Baron upon his Poem. When Morpheus (Serjeant of the night) had spred The foulding curtaines of my drouzy bed, This vision (in my dreame disturbed rest) Kept midnight Revels in my troubled brest. Me thinkes I saw upon the bifork't mount Ray-circuled Apollo set, and count His bay brow'd Sonnes I saw Jove's daughter too Minerva, in her right hand leading you, In'r left she held thy booke, she bow'd and broake, Her long continued silence, and thus spoke, “See Phæbus, here a new star risen be “I'th Galaxia of sweet poesie, “No Plbeian Poetaster, he is one “That is the A'tlas of thy Lyrick throne, “You'ue seene his face, take here his booke and finde “Portraitur'd by his owne rare pen, his minde. He took't and red thy slowrie pastorall, Thy courtly masque, verse, prose, applauded all, He stood amaz'd (to say true) and did muse That one so young such fine things should produce. At last he tooke a Daphnian wreath and laid It on thy ever honour'd head and said, “Welcome deare sonne still may the Delphick lyre “Be struck by thee, sonne welcome to our quire. “thy Life beyound thy Life from shall extend, “Fates have not power to make thy end, thy end. “Thou shalt out-live thy selfe, and not be dead “When dead this wreath shall bud about thy head, “These strenuous lines, these smooth poetick layes “Shall crowne thy Urne with ever-verdant bayes. This done, I wak't, and proud am growne to be A SMITH to Hammer out thy dignity. Wil: Smith Gent. To his admired friend Mr. Robert Baron upon his Booke. Great Madam Nature's womb as yet I see Is not growne feeble, it hath brought forth thee, Our ages ornament, t'ath brought forth thee, VVho art a Nestor in thy infancie. Thy thoughts (though green) so ripe they are, and rare VVith hoarie wisedome they may well compare. In thy elaborate Poem, fancies seeme In Learnings choyce, and cheife spoyles triumphing. Wits deepest mines thy eagles eye can spy. Thy cleerer soule sound their profundity. This thriving bayes, this verdant lawrell sprout, O're tops old slanders, at's peeping out, It shall even Scythian frosts survive, and last In spite of spattering envy, and the blast Of Momus keener breath, it shall be seene, Like youthfull Daphnie alwayes clad in greene. Cant pale fac't study cowe thy haughty sprite? Renowned Sir, wilt thou proceed in spite Of knotty arts? goe on still and be blest, Tough ruggid sciences thou shalt digest, And swallow time himselfe, who ne're shall have Power to reare for thy great name, a grave.

Scena 1 Gripus. Hegio. [Gripus.] VVhen gaudy Flora in her prime Observing it was Summer-time With fragrant flowers of each day Had made our mother Tellus gay, The new borne plumed minstrills fills The smiling heaven and ecchoing hills, With chirping musick, ev'ry grone Was made their quire.—Olympick Iove Commanded Aprels balmy shoures, To refresh the March bred flowers, And May perfection in each field To Aprils suckling babes to yield. The spring perfumed this brood, whose smell The Phenix nest might paralell. Now did approach the festivall Of god Silvanus nuptiall To his groue haunting Clarida, Then all the Faunes keept holyday. The nimble faries danc't, and all The dieties agresticall. Claius and kind Phisipile Vow'd loving Man and wife to be. So Clodin did to Colatine, So Serin to his Eglatine, So Cloris did to Coridon, And so delt sheapheards many a one. At length imploring love to be So propitious vnto me, To Mira the faire sheapheardesse In courteous wise, I did addresse My hand, my heart, my cap, my coyne, With all the good I could conjoyne, But she coy thing, refus'd to prove What gentle Hymen is, or loue. As pevish Daphne fled away From the illustrator of the day; Even so my sight coy Mira flies, My sighes she slights, my suit denies. When glorious Sol hath turn'd his back, And all the world is hung with black. Sleepe (natures soft-nurse) flyes my eyes, My mind's ore-cast as are the skies. When vailes are drawne, and dim fac'd night Have againe resign'd her right. To Phosphorus traine, when Titans head, Is washed from his Sea-greene bed, To shew his hoary looks, my griefe 'Gaine urge my tongue to beg reliefe To ease my minde, you Gods above, Or let me dye, or make her love. Hegio. Propitious more betide the friend, good day, Joves spangled Canopie protect thee still; May he himselfe from's Saphire colour'd throne Descend to be thy guardian, good day. Gripus. Wish me good day? it stands in idle stead, My Mira's coy, all my good dayes are dead. Hegio. Cheare up sad Gripus, or the cause declare, Why thou art thus plung'd in a deepe fit of Unprofitable melancholy, what? Hast made a case of spissified teares For thy swoll'n eyes, which are to limbicks turn'd Through which a running pearly torrent flow That lay the dust thy stamping feet doth raise. What unexpected stratagem have thus Perplext thy minde, exil'd thy judgement, and Condens'd thy understanding, and betray'd Thy spirits to disquiet passions. As frolick and as joviall I have knowne thee, As any of Paris followers, why then Dost terminate the sad Catastrophe And period of each sentence, with a sigh, A deepe, a farre-fetcht-sigh, such as would seeme The stuctures rafters for to cleave in sunder, But where such griefe I find, needs must I wonder. Gripus. Cupid hath fixt a golden shaft in me, Which makes me love, but into Mira's breast Have shot a leaden, a hate-causing dart, To love, and not to be belov'd againe, Is misery counted by each rustick Swaine. Hegio. Is love thy doloriferous disease? Quench, quench those smothring sparks, lest suffered They kindle, and increase into a flame, An inauspicious, and perpetuall flame. And like the glowing Amazonian cell, Scorch all that doe approch it nigh, and last Like fire-spitting Ætna wast its selfe. Amour la fut jamais ou sans peur, ou sans pleurs. Love never was without both feares and teares. Let then the bucket of thy courage stout, Draw so much reason out of the noble well Of thy understanding, as soone will quench This childish, and unmanly agony. What sad disterous torches Hymens light At every nuptiall? what unfortuate hands Sincke in the circle of the wedding ring, Nought breed in bridal sheets, but pinching feares, Iarres, discontents, suspitions, jelousies, Which nought but parting death can terminate. If kinder Hymen prove propitious, And vexe thee not with these; a barren wombe, A curse as cruell, may annoy thee still, Or else abortive births thy joy may kill. Or if with setled hope her time she goes, And then invite Lucina to her throwes, Or by hood-winkt mischance, or open blame, Why may not Atropos for Lucina come. If that infest thee not, tis small delight To see a little wanton ride a cock-horse Upon a painted staffe, or heare him chatter, Like a taught Sterling, Parret, or hoarse pye. I'de rather fill a barne full then a bed; More profit tis to have a crooked plough Still going, then a tottering cradle rocke. But more then that, these I terme foolish men, (But foolish is the Amorists epithite, Ou peut a peine aymer ensemble estre sage, One scarse can be both wife, and love, together) That ere will trust their honour in a Burke, Made of so flight weake bulrush as woman, Apt every fleeting minute for to sincke it. And how canst thou expect fidelity, In the disloyall sex call'd feminine. Remember fiftie sisters, Belus daughters, Who all (save one) made of their husbands slaughters. And both th' Atrides had their envied lives Endanger'd by the falsehood of their wives. Euriphile (false Hag) her husband sould To Poliayces for a chaine of gould. And Queene Euridice conspired How to deliver to grim visag'd death Her regall Lord, and husband to enthrone In his voyd roome her fancied Sonne in Law. The fierce Medea did delacerate Absyrtus tender members, to escape Her Fathers pursute, if we may rely On the report of sage Antiquity. Grip. Thou pleadst against thy selfe, Ile turn the point Of thy last daggar into thine owne breast. Thou sayst Medea tore in twaine her brother Absyrtus, tis confest, 'twas to discover Her ardent, and firme setled desire To follow Jason, ungratefull Jason, Who after that, left her and all her charmes, To clap another Lady in his armes. So have I seene a Horse-leach oft embrace, Cleave to and hang upon some bloud-swoln face, Till its owne turne be serv'd, it holdeth fast, Untill his panch be full, then drop at last. But to our taske. Penelope liv'd chaste, Though twice five years her royall Lord was gone, Did not Æneas flie, and leave his sword To let out over-credulous Dido's bloud. When as Hiero blam'd his wife, 'cause she, Never inform'd him of his stinking breath. I thought (quoth she) that all mens breaths smelt so. Arria when Petus was condem'd to dye, First stab'd her selfe, then giving him the steele, This wound (deare Petus grieves me not quoth she) But that which thou must give thy self grieves me. The Minians wives having obtained leave, To say valete to their dying Lords, Exchang'd their habits, and expos'd themselves (In their escaped Spouses roomes) unto The penalty of the offended Law. Dona the partner of her husbands woe, With him a long way (as his Page) did goe. When Conrad gave the Matrons leave to beare, From Weinsberg foe-girt town what best they lik't, Each tooke up her owne husband on her backe. Cornelia Annia did prostrate lye, On her defunct Lords Sepulchre, and dye; For this cause annually a paire of Doves Are sacrific'd to their firme setled loves. And happy Phillacides loyall wife, From death redeem'd him with the losse of life. But in my uncertaine waies hath Phillis gone. To find her runnagate Demophoon. Hegio. Humanum est errare, I confesse, Both sexes then are faulty; but what else Doe thy deluded eyes discover in Thy Mira, that thy heart should fancy her. Ist for her skin-deep beauty (her chiefest pride) That's but times fading flowre, which as tis Most delicate, is as volatious. Its like unto the Colours Phidias drew, Which seemed most admirable to the view, But suddenly did vanish and impaire, At the weake puff of each aeriall breath. A wife is but a faire affliction. Symonides reputed her to be, The Shipwrack of a man, the tempest of A house, the troubler of quiet rest. A prison of life, a plague assiduall, A sumptuous conflict, a necessary evill, A horrible care, an ordinary battell, A dayly hinderance, the humane slavery, A faire Aspe, an inevitable paine, A pleasant damage, a domestick strife. If then coy Mira scorne with thee to dwell, On earth leave her to leade bruit Apes in hell. Gripus. Quote not these Accherontick Anchorites. Those stollid moatheaten Foolosophers, That libell against Angels, those night-birds That doe defile even their owne nests, nay worse, That strangle sacrilegiously the fames Of their owne mothers; Those ungracious brats That impiously requite with Stygian Inke The Nectar which indugently they lent them. Heed not the hissing of that viperous brood Of Parricides to their own mothers names. A female is the second part of man, She is a male i'th the newest edition, A wife's the best of her Lords movable. For such a one fierce Champions have prov'd tame, The stoutest Souldiers trembled, and look wan, Ready to give their ghost up at a frowne, The oracles of wit and Philosophy, Have been loves fooles, and bent their litterature, But to expresse great loves Supremacie, And the extent of its Dominions. Nay under Venus sacred Ensignes march, Etheriall troopes of high mounted gods. Hegio. Well, each man as he likes, but should the mad Disloyall Sycophant, whose spheare is woe, Attempt to shoot a raving shaft at me, In's many peeces I would make't recoile Upon his corps, as there be golden sands, In the Pactolian or Tagean shores. Gripus. Cease, cease, good Hegio, to repine at love, Atlantas pace was staid by golden balls. And gods themselves are oft ensnar'd by love, For they have slipt beyond their skill in that, They have made beauty of a greater force Then they themselves are able to resist. For Læda, Jove became a wandring Swan, And for Europia a loud lowing Bull, And for Antiopa a Satyre rude, And for bright Danae a storme of Ore. Did not Apollo leave his burnish't throne, Lay by his tresses? and in humane shape, Most humbly beg a boone at beauties gate? Did not Alcides for Jole's sake With huge oft draw the slender threed. He was tane captive by his captives looke, She tooke the Conquerour that had her tooke. Kind Paris for to steale his dainty peece, Travell'd as farre as betwixt Troy and Greece. And Perseus amongst the Negroes sought, And faire Andromade from Jnde brought. Cupid can make the Regall Lyon sport, In amorous dalliance with the frisking Kid. Venus can yoake the ravenous and fell kite, With milder Swans in the same Chariot; Immane rapacious Eagles she can linck And timorous silver-brested Doves together. When she commands all animalls lay by Their contrarieties, and antipathy. Exit. Hegio. Enjoy, sir, your conceit, but for my part, I am invulnerable, thou blind Boy Shalt never take me captive, I am like Achilles dipt in Styx, nor doe I feare Thy boy-ships shafts, goe play with angry Bees And painted Butterflies, and at the Wasps nest, And when th' art stung, in thy mams lap goe rest. Scena 2. Venus. Cupid. [Venus.] Hearke Cupid and revenge, this prophane Swaine Do's slight thy quiver, and blaspheme thy bow, He sayes he's shot-proofe, scornes thy archery, Scoffes at thy skill. Cupid. Ile penetrate his heart, Ile make him be an earnest Votary Unto a marble-hearted female Saint. Ile melt to amorous thoughts his soule of stone, Ile torture 'm in loves torrid, frigid Zone. Ile make him in the same flames freez, and fry, The world shall be inamour'd of his woe, Ile find a Shepherdesse in whom he'le joy, And this his darling I will soone infect With coynesse and with nicenesse, for her sake. His morning Orisons shall nothing be But numbers of innumerable sighs, Which he shall count by pearly teares, not beads. Ile make the cherries of her ruby lips The onely cordials for to sustain His loathed life, and those shall be like to Fugacia poma, which like Tantalus He alwaies shall desire, and alwaies misse. Ile make him view the place where she hath set, And thither he shall repaire, as if he thought, The place some soveraigne vertue did containe To ease him, and to cure his gnawing paine. Venus. Let him not wander far from home to seeke Deepe streames in which to wash his frisking flockes. Let such uncessant flouds flow from his eyes As may supply the want of rivolets, Let his pin'd cheekes and hollow countenance, Affight all wolves from his secure sheepe, Let him spend all his daies in pinching griefe, And melancholy discontents; and looke Like to a wither'd tree o're-growne with drosse. Let his illetable and pensive sighes, Scare all rapacious, and omenous Ravens From picking out the eyes of his young Lambs Bleating for nutriment unto their dammes. Cupid. Innumerable such effects as these, Shall all be caus'd by this keen pointed dart. When as the long-tongu'd Lord of envious light, Whose presence make the day, whose absence night. Betray'd my mother, and the god of warre. Unto the sooty, black, club-footed dolt, As he was tempering of a thunder-bolt, For to revenge this wrong, I made him prove, The power of my golden shaft and love. And I will make this Hegio soone confesse, I am a god, and of the starry race. He shoots. Now lay thy hatred downe, thy spite decline, And prove a votarie at Daris shrine. Exeunt. Scena 3. Hegio solus. But sure I was not borne Minerva-like? Nor did fond Paracelsus teach my Sire To make a man without conjunction, What furious madnesse did possesse my brest To flout at love? and wrong the femal sex? And to requite in a sharpe Satyrs straine, The roundelayes, and charming lullabies, That my indulgent genetrix did warble? What are my braines grown dry, or my bloud cold? Or am I on a sudden waxen old? I thought, though Cupids aire-deviding shaft, Soone penetrated the well tempered Corsset: which the hot-halting god of fire, Made for his boysterous rivall, it should not find, Or make a way to vulnerate my mind. And therefore Venus I blaspem'd thy sonne, But now I sing a Palinodia. Alas I have beheld that lovely face That from her eyes shot Cupids into mine, T'abuse my sight, and worke upon my frailty, With their smooth oratory to undoe me, Among thy other trophies let me be, Kind Cupid, Hertan Porrigo to thee, Me thinks soft love hath lately made a breach Into the batter'd bulworks of my breast, And there commandeth all my yeelding powers, Which now insulteth in their vassalage. One looke hath struck my soule into a feaver, Me thinks affection whispereth in my eare Faire Daris name, Daris the shepherdesse; An object beautified with the choice gifts Of liberall nature, and of vertue too, My wandring eye hath made my heart receive So good opinon of the forenam'd Nymph, And hourely it solliciteth my tongue, To trie my fortune, and to let it know, Whether its like in Daris love to rest In happy blisse, and blissefull happinesse; Which if deny'd, its suddenly prepared, To leave my skelliton unto grim death. But courage Hegio, let not cold despaire Chill thy greene, and wide-gaping wounds too fast; She is a woman, and she may be wonne, Venus Adonis lov'd, why may not she Prove love-sick too, and at length fancie me: Shall I be bashfull then, and so expire With griefe; fie, fie, what shall a womans eye Prevaile so farre o're me to cause me dye, And leave my name in the fooles Callender, And there be noted with a rubie letter, For a supereminent Festivall; No, I am loath to leave earth yet, Ile try If I may live, and find a remedie. Exit Scena 4. Chorus of Faires. Bright Phœbus who with morning light Put'st Hesperus twinckling traine to flight, When as thou rowzest, and display Thy golden locks, and summon day; Thou who dost rest thy drowzie-head, In aged Thetis froathy bed: When as thy gilded Car of day, His glowing axle doth allay. Thou who in twice 6 Months fulfill Thy journall on th' Olympian hill, Illustrious Lord of light, in vaine Thou bragg'st with arrowes to have slaine Thy Python sterne, whose massie bones Were Iron barres, like congeal'd stones His knotty sinewes were, the boughes Wer's shady covers; his great troughes Deepe Rivolets, which he (well nigh) Caroused at one watering dry: His belching shot forth flames, his eye Shin'd like the dapled morning skie. Faire Venus thy young hood winkt sonne More glorious trophies oft have won, Thou that crown'st thy loves with bayes, Inventer of mellodious Layes. Thou left'st Pernassus bifork't hill, And Tempe thy faire domicill, At loves command, and all to be At Daphne's shrine a Votary. Thou that did'st by virtuall heat The happy plants, and herbes create, Couldst find no plant, or herbe to be A medicine for loves maladie. When thou commandst the birds to bring, In triumph to the world, the Spring, The new-clad earth hath quickly lost Her Snow-white roabes, no chilly frost Candies the grasse, no ycie creame Congeale the lake, or pearly streame; No snow lies sheltred in the shade, The earth is thaw'd and tender made: For all thy heat, thy love doth lowre, Nor had thy scalding rayes the power To thaw her Marble yce, and this T'was caus'd her Metamorphosis. Large limb'd Hercules trebly blest With fame, thou who in youth exprest Deedes of honour, thy cradle's crownd With brave achivements, which renown'd Thy name; thy valour was suppli'd With strength, thy haughty spirit defi'd An hoast of men, Heaven ne're conjoyn'd So strong a body, or so stout a mind. 1. Brag not cause you slew and withstood Within the thick Næmæan wood A beast, the temper of whose heart Was like a nether Milstone; Dart, Nor threatning Sword, nor frightfull Speare, Could terrifie it with Panick feare: Like knotty wreaths of craggy brasse His sinewes were, a noise did passe From's mouth, which might strike deafe the eares Of mortals, and affright the Spheres; You wore his ruggid shaggie hide About your shoulder, and left side. 2. The Hydra by thy hand was slaine, Whose heads lopt off sprouted againe. The mud was made his downie bed, The stones were pillowes for his head, His speckled jawes which hideous were, Thy brawny armes did boldly teare. 3. Thy club made th' Erymanthean Beare. Lye weltring in his ruddy goare, His sharpened tusks shall spoile no more (As it was wont to doe before) Arcadia, which in antique dayes Did warble out her well-tun'd Layes, And sing loves on her oaten reed, Whilst her secure flocks did feed. 4. The Centaure thou subdu'st by force, Halfe like a man, halfe like a horse. 5. Swifter then wind you ran, or thought, On foot a running Stag you caught. 6. Rapacious bird Stymphalide, Were made a prey to death by thee. 7. Thou mighty Scavinger wert able To clense the foule Augean stable, 8. You made a Bull to crosse the Maine, And graze on Neptunes liquid plaine. 9. And Diomedes fell monster, Who made his captives provender To his proud pamper'd steeds, by thy Revengefull hand did justly dye. 10. False Cacus thou didst crush to death, And 'twixt thy armes squeeze out his breath: 11. Cease the adjuring world to tell Of thy forc't entrance into Hell. You swadled Charon with his oare, The triple-headed ban-dog roare, And yelle: you Pluto ere you're gone Confronted on his jeaty throne. 12. Hesperides fruit, sweet and gay, By thee were stolen, and borne away. By Juno's labours you war'nt broke, And yet you yeelded to loves yoake. Thus Love made Hegio to espie Sweet Daris Phisiognomy, And prove close pris'ner to that eye, Whose frownes make him prepar'd to dye, Love wound her too, that we may all Keepe holyday at their Nuptiall. Exeunt. Actus 2. Scena 1. Hegio. Grypus. Now we are both in the same predicament Of Passion, we both blest objects love. But through their nicitie, and coy disdaine, We're like Loves cursed abjects both to prove. Now, now we Symbolize in egritude, And Simpathize in Cupids malady. My drooping head, my deepe contracted brow, My bloudlesse cheeks, dead eyes, pale lips, faint tongue, Shall strive in each point thine to equalize. My heart even now resolv'd my hasty feet Should measure out the over tedious way To Daris (whose faire face a garden is, In which fresh beautie plants her choysest flowres But frozen Winter keeps his risidence. Ith Domicil of'r Adamantine heart.) I thought each wearie step to be a mile, I thought each pace to be a measur'd league, Untill I heard her tender nibling Lambes Imploring with their bleating oratory, Some aliment of their indulgent dames. At length I spi'd upon a happy mount. My Daris, whom the Sunne did gently kisse, (Being then mounted in his mid-day heat.) Daris both singing sat, and knitting too. As if her nimble fingers sought to keep, True tune with her tongues Musicke.— Thus shee sung. Song. [I haue a Sunne-burnt Pilgrim seen] 1 I haue a Sunne-burnt Pilgrim seen That dry hath been, Hasting unto the Christall Springs, Where downe he flings His prostrate body, then he'le be With bended knee A Votary Vnto the flowing Dietie. 2 But when his sweating face is drencht And thirst be quencht In her coole waves, then this his sweet With saucy feet He kicks, and from the slighted place Soone moves his pace, And court no more The silver Nymph so lov'd before. 3 So Io was with foule scorne wasted, When once tasted By the injurious ravisher Great Jupiter, Who first with prayers did invade The credulous Maid; After the rape He plagu'd her with a brutish shape. 4 Kind Mayden Goddesse by thy skill Protect, and still Let netts of passions finest thread Never thee spread, Nor snaring Poems proffer'd be T'intangle me. For they indure For their reward a Calenture. 5 That fondly prove too kinde to cure Loves disease.—I'de rather sure That my fond Lover still should pine Then that his wanne cheek should assigne, A sempiternall blush to mine. Still chast Dian let me be thine. Ile vow allegiance at thy shrine, No Nuptiall bands shall me combine. Whilst thus she sung, the winds grew whist, the wild Incensed Beares, and Panthers proved mild, Amazed I a fixed tree did prove, But wonder blasted trees did dance, and move, Each bends his palsie tops to worship her, And turne obsequious Idolater, Her Lyrick ayres intic't the ravish't quire Of birds to come, which (being come) admire. The scaly fish to heare her voice did lay Upon the waters top, and frisk, and play. Ere while I fondly thought love could convay (Although he's deified) no other way, But through the gazing eyes, into the heart His love-infected, keene and fatall dart, But whilst I heard this smooth-tongu'd Syren sing On the harmonious aier-deviding wing Of her sweet voice, it plainely did appeare, That subtile love could enter at the eare. Long time I stood amaz'd, at length vow'd I To live by her propitious smiles, or dye By rigorous frownes shot from her awfull eye. I sad for nuptiall love, she strait deny'd, I plead affection, by she reply'd (Disdainfully) denialls, and left me An abject unto love and miserie. Gripus. Even now anatomiz'd by groanes and sighs, Almost interr'd and buried in woe, To Mira's pastures I resolv'd to goe, The sheep and lamkins with rich fleeces loaden, Became my spokes-men, and with bleating noise Pleaded at Mira's barr for my admission. She mounted sate upon a happy hillock. Clad in the verdent plush of Madam Nature, In twisted braids of silver Lillies knitting, The loose traine of her amber dropping haire. Phœbus my rivall prov'd, and wo'd my faire, He graz'd upon her corall lips, and bath'd Himselfe in balmy juice of fervent kisses. He seiz'd the rose-buds in the spicy beds Of her delicious cheekes, whilst thus shee sung. Song. 1 Mens loves like tinder set on fire Flame, and expire. Fond love doth faile With brittle beauty. Beautie's fraile Like Junes raine, or Decembers Sunne 'Tis quickly dene. Or like to the Solsticiall flowre, It buds and withers in an houre. 2 Cælia's locks so aptly twin'd, Each haire would bind Olympick Jove, In a strong twisted net of love, If to descend downe he assumes His Eagles plumes, These baires will change their hue, and grow Hoary and cold, as melting snow. 3 Like to a comely field of Snow Now shewes her brow, Rutts shall betray Ere long, and wrinkles deep display, Times plough have furrowed her brow. An Ice shall flow Through ev'ry veine, she shall discry Pale Death displaid in her dimme eye. 4 Each beame shot from her eye so gray Creates the day, That eye oft made By winkes, the noone-day Sunne a shade, Now it is youthfull Cupids nest, 'Tis at the best. For it will prove his grave, and be Ecclipsed in obscurity. 5 Of flowres both the King and Queen In'r cheeks are seen By graces led Thither, and laid in nuptiall bed On whom sips like Nymphs doe wait In regall state. They blush and redder grow, by this That they themselves, themselves still kisse. 6 No Lilly shall be found, or Rose In cheeke, chin, nose, When age growes on And beauties Summer time be done, As Swallowes seeke when Summers gone Some warmer Sunne. So will disloyall Lovers all Which now fond Celia servants call. 7 Then shall I love a man that may Love for a day. But when I'me pin'd, And yellow spred, where red once shin'd, Leave me an abject for to be To misery. No, No, the worst of Stigian paines, Is itch of love, in age dry'd veines. This musick stupifi'd my ravisht eares, And wrought an emulation in the Spheares. The Eccho listned to her warbled tones, And told their Joyes for every word aloud. Whilst she did subtly charme my listning eare, Love emptied his quiver on my heart. Musick so thaw'd my Adamantine mind, That not an arrow did resistance find. Thus did my Tyrant celebrate the prize, Act, and present, the triumph of her eyes, So Nero once with harp in hand survai'd His burning Rome, and as it flam'd, he plaid But to proceed, I begg'd great Iuno's blessing, T'attend my hopefull suite in the suppressing Loves common foes, disdaine, and nicetie. I made assault but never yet could board, Or scale the Adamantine heart of hers, I fly like a struck Hart before the hounds, With th' winged wantons Javelin in my wounds. Exit. Hegio. As when my over daring eye behold The suns bright beames, I twinckle with my lids: Even so the rayes, the day creating rayes, The radient rayes, which Daris doe dart forth From th' Ebon arches of her heavenly browes (Whose winkes convert the highest mounted sun, The noon-day sun, unto a gloomy shade) Have blasted my weake eyes, and lately led Unto her royall person me a slave. My eyes are swollen up, as loath to see The glaring sun, so injurious to me, That bright coale which cleares all the world beside Hang like a fatall commet ore my head, Ere since he's so unkind in holding forth Enough of light to see this shining lasse Whose eyes will prove my parching burning glasse. Exit. Scena 2. Mira. Daris. Tyndarus. Mycon. Dipsas. Thestila. Mira. Haile Daris, may I joy you? Daris. Me, for what? Mira. For what? each busie Shepherdesse have fill'd Her lap with flowers, for to compose, and knit A nuptiall chaplet for your Bridall browes. Daris. The Bridegromes wanting still, Mira. No, tis Hegio, Daris. Psh, if your love sick Gripus speed no better In's earnest suite, then Hegio's like to doe Hel'e never breake with you a Bridall cake; But why should I say if? 'tis sure enough Each Shepherd now is tuning of his pipe To warble your Epithalamians. Mira. Then let them turne them into Elegies And Epicediums for Gripus death. Daris. And let the Shepherdesses weaue a wreath Of Willowes to encircle Hegio's browes. Here comes our Parents. Tyndarus. These faire maides, I hope. Are counselling each other to prove kinde, And pitty their distressed lovers. Daris. Lovers, Sir, what have we to doe with lovers, wee Have sworne alleageiance at Diana's shrine; If we should love, we breake the faith we owe To Virgin purenesse, and our vestall vow. My. Such are like plum-trees that doe crooked grow Ore standing pooles, they laden are, and rich With pleasant fruits; but nought but chattering Pyes, And Crowes, and Catterpillars feed upon them. Tyndarus. O fie upon this single life, forgoe it, We read how Daphne for her peevish flight, Became a fruitlesse Bay-tree, Sirinx turn'd To a pale empty Reed, Anaxarite Was frozen into Marble, whereas those, Which married, or prov'd kind unto their friends, Were by a gracious influence transform'd Into the Olive, Pomegranet, Mulberie, Became Flowers, precious Stones, or eminent Starres. Dip. Imprudent girles, why should we women prove Sore tortures, and disturbances to men, If we be foule we're odious and loath'd. Thest. And such unkinde girles as these are, if faire, Are like rich vessels full of poysonous drugges, Or like blacke Serpents arm'd with golden scales. Mira: Cease to perswade, for Gripus name and death Have both one sound in my esteeme, that tongue Which warble forth the one, doe chant the other. Daris. That direfull sound, that most disasterous knell Attendeth Hegio's name, and ever will. Tynd. Rare grace, and comely feature both are joynd In you, as if they both cospir'd to make Two parragons, which should excell each other. Shall common beauties then, and meaner faces Enjoy these joyes, which your selves deny Unto your selves, no let your gentle hearts Imbrace the sweets due to so faire deserts, Your lovely features were bestow'd on you By liberall nature for to be injoy'd; And 'twere a sinne where she have beene so free Of her best graces, to be nigardly. Micon. Wound not your selves through your poore lovers sides, Starve not your selves to make them pine away, Be kind unto your selves, if not to them. Dipsas. Vse time, the squabling Snake with age oreworne Casts off her hide, and re-assumes a new. The towring Eagle change her aged plumes, The fading Rose (the glory of the Spring) Receive an annuall birth from the sharp briar, Be wise, and crop in time your beauties flowers, They ne're spring more, being faded once, like ours. Thest. Vse time, no lovers will croud to impart Their thriving sutes to your age deafned eares, Chuse constant lovers then whilst that you may, Such as love for a like-long-age, not dayes, Your beautie's fraile, and soone will bud, and wither, Mir. With beauty love will bloome, &amp; blow together. Daris. Beauty and love are like the coupled twins Of wise Hipocrates, who both at once Received birth, and nutriment, and death. Mira. He ne're shall crop my youthfull beauties slower That i'le cease to love, when beauty 'gins to lower. Exeunt. Scen. 3. Gripus. Hegio Gripus. Of late I did (not brooking a deniall) Renew my suite, attempt a further triall, Intreat, conjure, I left no way untri'd I must not, no I would not be deni'd. This was my resolution, but she The obdurate portall of whose Marble heart Was lockt, and barr'd against the powerfull art Of oft repeated teares, or far fetcht sighs, Or deep, and heart-bred groanes, stood deaf, and dumbe She must not, no she would not be o're come. Hegio. I never move her, but my hopelesse triall Alwayes reade Hieroglypicks of deniall. Gripus. Still lets proceede, who knowes we may prevaile, Let not our best advis'd indeavours faile, To be employd, lets make a further triall, And fairly speed or find a foule deniall. Exeunt. Scena. 4. Chorus of Faires Some love, and have their loves rewarded Some love, and are no whit regarded, Some woe and speed, some woe and be Rejected for their loyaltie, This tyrant love compar'd may be To th' Macedonian dietie Whose lookes seem'd sometimes to disdaine This Champion, or that again, It would cast amorous glances forth Applauding to his mighty worth. No torture, no affliction Like to true loves passion, This made Sophocles wish his foe Might onely be tormented so. Exeunt. Finis Act. 2 Actus 2. Scena 1. Hegio. Gripus. Hegio. Exil'd from mirth I wander up and downe, Gall'd with loves tyranous torment, lo I ly, Inthrall'd, and bound in Cupids golden chaines, Perplext with wo, my feature all is blur'd And chang'd, and I am Metamorphosed. Gripus. I am transformed too, O how hath passion Thrust all my thoughts, and senses out of fashion. Hegio. My head of late was thatcht with yellow straw Now it is perriwig'd with Winters gray. Gripus. My front as smooth as Ivory while ere Now beares deepe furrowes, made by sorrowes plough, In which the seeds of woe are scattered. Hegio. My eyes are Ilands, they're girt round about With troubled Oceans, and tides of teares. Gripus. I spend those teares whose store will ne're be spent, Yet shall I want teares; before cause of them. My Mira score not up my cares, and feares, Nor keep a Catalogue of my sad teares. Hegio. Quotidian feavers of reproch and scorue, Have chill'd the vigour of my wounded heart, Yet by the scorching raies of Daris eyes, It still is ignifi'd and glowes, and flames, O Daris let the showres of thy love Asswage the glowing fire of my passion. Gripus. If I should put to Sea and boldly plough The glassie face of Neptune, love would be My Pylot. If perchance I walke abroad For recreation, my companion Is love, the fruitlesse love, of coy Mira. Hegio. When the soft charmes of labour chasing sleepe Seize with their downy wings upon my eyes, When heavy Morpheus with his leaden keyes Close up my watchfull senses, love's my pillow. Grip. Me thinks the gentle gales of winds that move The trembling boughs, and through their palsie leaves, Breath musicke, whisper Mira's name to me. Hegio. Me thinks the notes of all the chirping birds Are chang'd, and warble nought but Daris name. Grip. Me thinks that Eccho which doe alwaies speak In answer to my sighs, say Mica's coy. Tis true, Diana hath more Nimphs then one In store, but no fruit else will please my taste, But what Hesperides garden brought forth, No colour please my eye but that which was Stained by the fish Maurieticall, And none but Mira can my fancy move. O Mira that my heart were flint like thine, Or thine were soft, and plyable, like mine. Hegio. The birds wander in the flowrie fields In the wild benefit of nature, live Happier then we; for they may choose their mates, And carroll their sweet pleasures to the Spring, Whilst I doe languish like a a Plant in drought, And lay all pickled up in briny teares. Great Jove who setst upon thy Saphire throne, Spangled with Starrs, Remember, Venus sonne Transfixt his darts in thy celestiall breast, And learne to pitty slighted Lovers by The pangs you felt in that extremity. Grip. Sacred Apollo call to minde the time When thou wert beauty blasted, as I am, And if thy ayre dividing dart can't make Mira to love, let them make Gripus dye. Heg. And thou faire Paphian Queen (cause of my wo) Thy self didst once implore Adonis love, Prove you as kind, I'me tortur'd on thy rack, Ease my sad soule, or cause my heart-strings crack. Exeunt. Scena 2. Venus. Cupid. Venus. What though with wrie-mouth'd scorn and squint-ey'd scoffes These Shepherds once did sleight and scorne thy bow, Yet don't extend thy punishments so farre, As they should fatall prove, son save their lives. Yeares heavy loaden with their months retire, Months end, their date of measur'd dayes being come, And dayes full hour'd to their periods tend, And howres chast with light-foot minutes end, Let their undaunted e'uls now find reliefe, Let rip'ned time now terminate their griefe. Cupid. What pretty weather-cocks these women be, I've oft heard Willow-wearing Crites say, (Accusing Dilla of unconstancy) That Uenus was a Planet, no fixt Sarr, Nor did he deviate from truth in this, Twice in a minute she will wax, and wane. Of late made drunke with furious passion, With eyes converted into raging flames, With wrinckles on your sterne contracted brow, Wrinkles (by anger made) like Sepulchers, In which poore Hegio might have been interr'd; Urged with speedy haste, you summon'd me To give attendance, without slow delay, I shook my nimble pearle-imbroider'd wings, And cut the skie to execute your will, I had command to torture Hegio, To tosse him in loves blanquet, and to make him The most distrest of men, a scorned lover, Now you would surfet him with happinesse, Now you would throw his Mistris Julio's armes, You'd have her struck too, that she sick might be No more of coynesse or unconstancie. Venus. The Eagle scornes to stoop unto a Fly, The Regall Lyon doth refuse to prey On him that prostrate lies, and will you prove More cruell then these be? Then Poets pens Shall Satyrs drop, and paint out thy disgrace, Thy childehood, nakednesse, and hoodwinck't face, Prove kind, and ev'ry tongue shall carroll forth, And chant in amorous lines thy lasting praise. Cupid, he shoots. Yeild (gentle girles) to love, now each goe rest, Her amourous heart in her true lovers breast. Scena 3. Gripus. Hegio. Eccho. Grip. Lanch forth sad soule into an Ocean Of teares, driven by the blustring gales of sighs, To find the Haven, and seeke safe harbour out, But stay a while, I thinke I'de neede provide Some other Pylot for to steere and guid Thy ballanc't bulk, besides sorrow, and griefe, For these I feare will strike, and split o'th sands, Wanting a Compas in their quavering hands. How ere th' art like to leake, and sinck i'th waves, Ith' raging Waves of sad despaire, if so Thy sailes and tacklings thou to flames maist turn Cast overboard thy hope, thy carkasse burne. My grief's a boundlesse Sea that knowes no Shore. Hegio. O that I were a Basiliske that I Might venome Daris, or unvenom'd dye. To some tenebrious dungeon let us hie Where never day shall be acquainted with us, Where we'le remaine still in obscurity. Cursing our fates, and never more behold Sols radient and splendidious raies; and heare The melancholly Owle Nictimine, (The chiefest friend of solitarinesse) The sullen Dogs, the immitating Apes, Shall still converse with us, and such dumb things, To whom nature denies use to sound our names, Our grifes to blab, or fames to damnifie. Eccho. Fie, Hegio. We wish for death, we live without all hope, Eccho. Hope. Gripus. Hopes t'obtaine our loves their are none, Eccho. One. Hegio. 'Tis bootlesse to try againe, Eccho. Try againe. Gripus. Say, shall we then obtaine reciprocall love? Eccho. Love. Hegio. Shall we assuredly Upon a babling Eccho's voice rely? Alas, he fondly prates, shall we beleev't? Eccho. Beleev't. Gripus. We will; and as thy tale prove true, So will we credit Eccho's. Eccho. Credit Eccho. Hegio. Now as a well is hotter, when the ground Weare Winters hoary mantle, then when as Earth decking Flora doth invest the grasse In Summers tapestry, and Junes parliament roabs By an Antiperistasin, or by The cirumambient ayres humidity, Which in a manner doe besiege it round, And make th' intrinsique heate unite, and so Concentre to resist th' invading foe: So let their coynesse set an edge on us, And cuspidat our animosities.

The blossome of my nonage is not blowne, Nor doe the strength of nature (yet) beginne To uneffeminate my downy cheeke. I place no happinesse in womens smiles, Nor torture in their ill-becomming frownes, My heart is shot-free (yet) nor doth it lye In the faire casket of a Females eye, But haile Agroicus, what think'st of love. Agroicus. In good sooth, I know not how to devine it, or give an extract deminution of it, but as I deceive, its very nocent, and almost omninocent, where it gits the upper hand. Love and the botts have kill'd many an old horse, my Grandame told me that. And I have heard an old blancient boet say that Megander swum through Hell to his Hero, I thinke hee was a Goose to doe so; And yet my Zonne Tom did more the 'tother day, he leapt over a high wall, and waded through a deepe moate past his depth, to git to Margery. As I came up at the butt londs end, I met him in that case, but O, how did I bemire, and wonder, to see his new slop and all his cloathes bejeered with the mud of the pond he ran through. The old Boet I bominated before, said, That when folke fell in love, a blind naked boy, he called him Stupid, shot them, 'Twas he shot my Zonne Tom, by the Maskins I would give the best cow in my yard, to find out this raskall Stupid, and I would thrash him, as I did the Henne last Shrove-tuesday. Exeunt. Scena 5. Gripus. Hegio. Hymen. Gripus. Like as a guilty prisoner, upon whom Offended Justice lately past her doome, Drags his sad Irons from the loathed jaile, (Hopelesse to live) unto the cursed tree Where he stands muffled (but an inch from death) His last prayer said, and hearts confession made; At last (unlookt for) come a slow reprieve. And gives the wretch some few daies more to live. Now he (lost in amazement) boldly rends Deaths muffler from his eyes, and scarcely knows (Being over-joy'd) whether he lives or dyes: Even so joy whose life is quit from death, And despaire, by Mira's propitious smiles, Now 'gins t'approach my Festivall, and rest, I've chast dull sorrow from my pensive brest. Hegio. Thanks gentle Eccho for thy sweet direction, Thankes gentle Juno for thy kind protection, Daris is wonne, Hence loathed Melancholly, Avaunt, avaunt from hence thou Snake-hair'd Devill, Thou hollow-eyde monster full fraught with evill, Hence, to the Abysle below, thy way imbrace, For that's thy Mansion, thy proper place. The guife that wants a bottom, there mayst dwell, And preside o're the counsell of darke hell, Inthroan'd in Radamanthus seat maist raigne Among the Cacodemons, ne're againe Ascend to cast thy influence ore my braine. Hymen. You that in this unfortunate age of love, This haplesse time of of Cupids tyranny, Have felt the worst that winged wag could doe Now banish sorrow, henceforth you shall be So happy as to thinke no wight is wretched, Or that there is a thing call'd miserie. What pleasures Poets fame of after death, In the Elizean arbusted groves, Shall spread themselves 'fore you, as if you were Tenants, or Farmers of those blessed shades, It shall be a perpetuall Spring, where you Inhabit, all disasterous dewes, and blasts Shall strangers to your happy pastures be. Come follow me, this my well-lighted flame Shall light you unto Ceres Tempell, where (Expecting you) they Nuptiall garlands weare, That hold your hearts enain'd in their golden haire. Exeunt.

The Quiver-bearing Wag, whose potent Bow Nor sex, nor age evades, nor high, nor low, The Goddesses so debonaire, and free Aglaia, Thalia, Euphrosyne, Esteem'd by men for their heart-easing mirth, Whom thou (faire Cytherea) at one birth Bore to the Ivie-crowned God of Wine. Egeria, at whose adored shrine The youthfull teeming females doe implore The Goddesse ayde, to these and divers more Direct thy summons, when they all Be congregated at great Joves White-Hall: (Divinest Queen of Love) perswade them still, To grant thy just demands, and passe this Bill, That whereas hoary Thetis did not chaine, (According as she ought) the boyling Maine. But traiterously did joyne with Dione And Malicerba to disturbe the Sea, When he (whose fame shall drop from many a pen, When Heralds shall want coates to sell to men, Whose Armes and Arts his glorious name shall raise, Alike to wreathes of Pallas Oakes and Bayes) Did furrow the great deep, and gently glide Over the bubling face of th' hasty tide, Bound for Clorindas armes (that happy port, That true Elizium, Queen pleasures Court) So that Clorinda (a bright Nymph to whom We grant priority, being overcome By her rare feature, alas she misses Those enthusiastick raptures, Lovers blisses; It's this day ordered by the joynt consent, Of the sublime Ætheriall Parliament, That Phœbus (whom terrestialls doe Adore, and yearly pay a tribute to) For ten nights next ensuing shall not rest His drowsie head in Rebell Thetis brest, But in Clorinda's lap should we assigne A longer date, the Sun would never shine, We should have short dayes, Sol would never rise From her lap, but to gaze upon her eyes, And whereas Boreas did let loose his breath, And Æolus threat nothing under death, And set the waves at variance with the skie, And made among the Flouds a mutiny: Its further order'd that for ten dayes the Fairy paire of jarring brothers cloysterd be, In slender Bottles; its decreed they both With th' Marine Deities shall take this Oath. From this time forward solemnly we vow To wait on sacred Lovers, whilst they plough The vast Gulphes back; it plainely shall appeare We will retreat, as glad to see them there; We will concurre in one, both Sea and Wind, To make their speedly passage safe, and kind. I Sea will smooth my buncht brow, and invite Their blessed eyes, to see how I delight To bear their weight, and joyntly with them prove Zealous adorer of the Queene of Love. And I the Wind (to storme forgotten quite) Will whisper new joyes to rich Amphitrite, And in so mild a breath Ile tell my Tale, As it shall onely fill their swelling sayle. And I the Sea, will boyle officiously To bring them to their harbours, whilst sad I Lament their absence, and dissolve to teares, And rather drowne my selfe then them with feares: This done (kind Cytherea) now release The Winds, and grant to the relenting Seas Once more the ancient immunitie, The Lamp of Lights nocturnall Bed to be: Those acts by which fierce Juno did conspire Alcides bane, augmented, and swell'd higher His venerable name, which now shall last Till Time want sand to run, or Fame a blast; So make this tempest raysed by the Seas To ruine thy Flaminius, encrease His firme emolument (faire Queene of Loves) We doe conjure thee, by thy silver Doves, To be his Guardian, let his lasting glory Fill all mens mouthes, and make the world a story. Finis Libri secundi. THE THIRD BOOKE [When Phaeton fell from Sols bright Throne] 1 When Phaeton fell from Sols bright Throne, And fail'd in's enterprise, How did his sisters him bemoane, And fill the ayre with cryes? 2 Proud Pelops Wife, bold Niobe, (Her off-spring being slaine) 'Gainst stormes approach, O how doth she In Marble still complaine? 3 What sorrow Orpheus did sustaine, When through th' infernall shade Thou, thy Euridice to obtaine, With Musick passage made. 4 What madnesse did corrode thy brest, wofull Andromache? When Hector (being laid to rest) Thy lucklesse eyes did see. 5 Astianax flung from a Tower, (The hope of Troy, and thee) O cursed act of a curst houre, what sorrow might this be? 6 What griefe Jocasta haddest thou, To see Eteocles Ingaged by a fatall vow, To slay Polynices? 7 Sad Dedalus, how small's thy ease, That saw thy daring Boy Baptize the vast Icarion Seas, And leave thee void of joy? 8 What should I speak how Progne griev'd For her Spouse, spouse breach, tell Should I, how sad Anthony liv'd After Acteon fell. 9 All this black Troop of dismall woes enumerated here, Are pleasures if compar'd with those which horally I beare. 10 Had I more tongues my griefe to tell, Then Romans (loath to yeeld) In one Rome-wasting Battell fell, In lucklesse Canna's Field. 11 Yet should I want an Idiome, Or dialect, to say My griefe in an idoneous tone, My tongue, ah welladay. 12 The Tongues of Muses are too faint In Helicon that keep T'expresse the cause of my complaint, Come Muses with me weep. 13 But why should I perplex the Nine with my griefe, when tis known, They finde enough (Ah) without mine, To relament their owne. 14 The ancient Helicon they've left, Since their Antiomers Was of his wisht for life bereft, They've made one of my teares. 15 I oft and oft did them invoke, But none of them reply'd, Their Harmony (alas) is broke Since their Mæcenas dy'd. 16 Come and approach, and attend to my cryes, you Hags and Hobgoblins, Register up and keep a catalogue of my teares, These archt walkes of midnight Groves will I never abandon, And Silvans shadowes, And shades that Clarida loves, Where silver buskin'd triping Nymphs were never affrighted, By harsh blows of the rude Axe from their hallowed haunt. 17 Here Death keepeth his Court. Here pitchy horror inhabits, This is griefes free-hold, Here will I chuse to abide, Come and aproach dapper Elves, Satyrs rough, and cloven-heel'd Fawnes, Not trickt and frounc't up As in the fresh flowry May, But civill suted Kerchift in Winter attire, Draw neer Ile teach you how To weepe teares in parts. 18 Sol retrograde with your fire breathing steeds, And shut my eyes up in eternall night, My soule have lost its Sun, my body needs No radient light. 19 Sinke toth' infernall shade, and let thy rayes, Illuminate their foggy hemisphere, Give to th' Antipodes that share of dayes, Which I doe hate here. 20 Acquaint them not with my anxiety, For then thy guilt carr will prove tedious, They'l fall a grieving too, and implore thee To returne to us. 21 Kind Phœbus grant me what I postulate, But if you slight, and churlishly deny't, My teares my optick sence shall adumbrate, And so make a night. 22 Larke Nor Thrush In no bush Shall tell his tale, Nor sweet Nightingale That on the bloomy spray, Carrols praises of fresh May, Come and inhabit this dim dale, Cuckow ever telling of one tale, Raven and Nyctimine, that love the darke. 23 Come Steele-digesting Bird, come and draw neere You brood-devouring Kite, greedy Want, That under-mines, fierce Cormorant: Come Falcon, and Vulture too, With the predictious Crow, Jay that ever talke, Griping Goshawke, Keep companie With mee, Here. 24 Antiomers, Apollo in the head, Mars in the hand, a Saint ith' heart, a man Who was the Magazine, or Vatican Oth' lib'rall Sciences, alas is dead. 25 Earth-decking Flora, beauteous Lasse that use To purple the fresh ground with vernal Flowers That suck in the Nectarian honied showers, Thou that wear'st Flowrets of a thousand hues. 26 Thou that the smooth shorne fields enamelest, And annuall wrapst the even shaven Plaine, In a mellifluous Rug of Flowers, daigne Propitiously to come at my request. 27 Come bring with thee the well-atti'rd Woodbine, The Lovers Pansie freakt with shining Jet, The tufted Growtoe, glowing Violet, Ruddy Narcissus, and pale Gessamine. 28 Bring the Faire Primrose (that forsaken dyes) The Daffadillies with cups fill'd with teares, All Amaranth's brood that Embroidery weares, To strew her Lawreat Hearse where my Love lyes. An Eclogue. Archus. Come swaine assume thy slighted pipe, and play Upon thy oaten reed a rounde-lay, Come warble amorous anthems, call to be Partakers in thy mirth the Napææ, That haunt arbusted groves, those rurall powers That live inshrin'd in oaken curled bowres, Among the sapplins tall, whose shady roof Are ringletts knitt of branching elm, star proofe, Call Natades from their obscure fluse By which his Alpheus met his Arethuse, Call mountaine Orcades for to comply To further with us this solemnity, Call the thrice three sweet Aganipian Nymphs That keeps the fancy in Heliconian lymphs Of eloquence, and straines heroicall To help us tune our dulcid madrigall. Avaunt thou Styx borne sadnesse, I'le take care Thou shalt be mist no more, the shaddow's are I'th deep of night, when Morpheus Leaden key Lock-mortalls under a black canopie, Rejoyce, and Jocæan sing to me Now Janus folding gates close boulted be, Sicilian tyrants are returned home Mars is appeased with a hecatombe. The tempest's one, the Cyprian ocean's calme, Our victors browes are crown'd with wreaths of palme. Plaindor. For Monuments we've hung up brused armes, To pleasuers we've converted stern alarms And dreadfull marches to delightfull greetings, And harnest squadrons into merry meetings. Grim Visag'd war hath smooth'd his brow, in stead, Of mounting of a fiery barbed steed. To fright pale foes, now all in a qualme He capes in a Ladyes Amphithalme. Bends all his nerves, and every meanes he'l prove To the lacivious pleasing of his love. No more the fruitfull name of Cuirassier Shall scare our swaines, or fleet Harquebusier. We shall dispute no more what Cavallrie Or ammunition meane, or Infantrie The Pouldron and Vambrace, the casque the sheare The flankes both right and left, the front, the reere Are Exotick words whose very sound Shall be no more heard in Cyprian ground. Nor ranck, nor file, lesse when we go a maying All in a row, or when we be a playng At Course a Parke, or telling of a tale To the Ranck't Lasses at a Whitson ale. I ne're shall see a sword, but such as grow Upon a flitch of Bacon, never know An other pike but such as daily glides Along the softly whistling riv'lets sides And by Meanders rushie frienged bank, Where growes the willow greene, and Osier dank I neere shall Loricate, or imbrace armes But such as are Floretta's voyce of harmes. No shield but that of sinowie brawn we'le beare Turne thou thy blade to knives great warrier To subdue Geese, and Capons, and carouse Healths in thy close hilt in a frolick bouse. To Tabers change thy drum, to kitts thy fife Let Bagpipes and shrill Harpsicons be rife, Come change thy trumpet and Bellona's flute To the loud Cimballs, Violl, Harpe and Lute, Whilst in this piping time, these Halcion dayes We doe contest who best their Loves can praise. Arcas. Hark Plaindor then how I anatomize My Julietta, and her encomionize. Were all the goddesses compos'd in one They would come short of her perfection. Gray headed morne blush to see her more bright Then th' eye of Moone, or her excelled Light. The dangling Tramells of her curious haire Then fine faire flax, are far more small and faire. Those golden threds in an even order set Entangle hearts, like fishes in a net. Her front is the perfection of delight The downe of Uenus doves is not so white. What covert charmes, what latent magick lies Within the circles of her speaking eyes. Beames shot from heaven like to a fiery dart Transfixt my soule, and scorcht my ravisht heart When peerlesse beauty did her cheekes compose Th' ingredients were the Lillie, and fresh rose. They are like a plum which blush (the sole cause is) 'Cause Phæbus now and then doth steale a kisse. Her straight nose, dimpled chin, incirled eares A snowy sute, or Ivory mantle weares. The porphier portalls of her honour'd words A relish most mellifluous affords. From these Jemms clad in rubie livery I cul fresh balme to heale loves malady Her teeth like orient pearle or ivory be Or like the new borne blossomes on a tree. Her thrice celestiall voyce which blesse our eares Proclames its consanguinitie with th' spheres. Her neck more comely then the polish't towre Whose walles Jove skal'd in a Tagean showre Her armes in hue heavens milkie zone surpasse Or white Æquoreall Neptunes fomie face. Her lovely armes are like prest curds, there stand Ledas pale Swan immewr'd in either hand. Now Muse returne into the milkie way Where Cupid (in a sweat) abathing lay About this beautious dale on either hand Loves Alpes and Uenus Pireney mountaines stand, With Azure curles each is inammel'd round And with a soft red Porphier berrie crownd. These are two Apples tane from Paradise The graces use to sport in wanton wise Under their shades Pomena's ripe fruit fall From lofty trees mov'd by no wind at all. To doe them homage, Cupid sucks from hence His sunshine dayes and love his influence. Greece borne and banisht love seeking to find A domicil where he might sit inshrin'd Parching himselfe in Juliettas eyes Intended in her heart to signorize But finding that too cold for's resience He tooke his flight to my close heart from thence, where with some firebrands, which himselfe did lay He sing'd his wings and must for ever stay. Her brest a feild of Lillies whiter shewing Then those Alcinons in thy Garden growing. Faire Erycina's Ida next to that Or Athos stand, or Cupids Ararat. Beneath this lies loves mediterranean The gulfe of Venice leading to thille of Man. To praise the Coloums of this structure, this Adored bulke, this amorous edifice Were a sit theame for the elaborate lines Of ever honour'd Maro, whose worth shines Bright in the lampe of poesie, and raise As many trumps as men to chant his prayse. In softnesse they the silke wormes web surpasse Woven in leavy shop, on Loomes of grasse. In whitenes Albian clifts, in smoothnes the Repumicated glasse of Normandy. Her round small feet beneath her roab doe run Now out, now in, as if they feard the sun. Plaindor. Floretta has for Dioniæa power To make each place she comes in Cupids bowre. Nature did summon every grace to meet. At the composure of a saint so sweet; And with more beauties they did her invest Then Cabalinean Poets have exprest I'th comely Aspect of the Paphian Queene Or more then in Corinnas face was seene. My Love a quarrie is, or Cabinet Where beautious nature her choyce gemmes hath set. Her amber locks shine like the Topace bright, Or golden Carbuncle, or Chrysolite Her eyes at each glance rutilate and sparke Like Diamonds in murke, tenebrous darke: Her faire infolded eares, high front, nose, chin Resemble the hate-spot Emerlin. Argent and Gules in her cheekes kindly mix As in the particolour'd Jasponix. The orifice, or ports of her words are In colour Corall, in worth Cinoper. Her pearle like teeth are an even placed row Of occidentall Margarites which grow In her fresh Rubie gumms, her round soft brests Where Cydias pigions fanbricate their nests Are Alabaster circumstructures, one Loves Ossa is, the other Pelion. Warme azure vaines (by prudent Natures skill) Inamell and inviron either hill, Streames of dissolved Jazul, circling founts Of liquid Turkise in these lovely mounts Make many pretty Islands, which appeare Some Ovall, some in figure of a Spheare. Her hands those gemms of love Antimonie Her digits nayles Arabian Oynx be. She's a chast Emerauld, and that this list Might perfect be, her hearts's an Amethist. Not stubborne and obdurate, but a heart Soone penetrated with loves wanton dart. Nor can the buckets of our rustick quire Quench this Asbeston flaming with Loves fire. The harmonie of lovelinesse and grace Combineth in the magique of her face. FINIS. Epithalamium. Mirrour of Men, tis Venus will Thou shouldst approve thy abler skill In loves Pharsalia, that she As well as Mars may boast of thee. Thy foe is the selected flowre Of Albions knot or beauties bowre A Cytherean Amazon. Loves Penthesilean champion. Imprison her in thy foulding armes And stoutly strike up loves allarms: And satiate with agile delights Your unrestrained appetites. My joy, and happie Omens meet With pleasure in the geniall sheet. In this sportive Sciamachie Where lips both shafts and targets be No cannons are, thy head to shroud In a blew mist or smoakie cloud. This is Cupids iolly feast Who proud to please so choyce a guest, Through loves Alimbique thee invite To distill the joyes of night, And from thy Mycrocosme by The art of Paphyan Chymistrie, One Catapasmian balme derive, Which may preserve thy name alive. May joy and happy Omens meet With pleasure in the geniall sheet. Both these whom Hymen here untie Make up but one Hermaphrodite Let their affections (Queene of love,) Within the same spheare alwaies move, And never terminate or know A thing call'd period, but grow And with their wreathes be alwaies seene Like Paphne cloath'd in Aprills greene. Thou that canst thy trophies show O're these, and o're thy mother too, Kindle dayly their desires Towards one another with new fires. May joy and happy omens meet With pleasure in the geniall sheet. The influence of starrs above Do Sympathize with sacred love This night by Uenus assignation Of two is made one constellation For Uirgo is (to shine more free) Transferred into Gemini. These twinckling starres concur to beare A Hieroglyphick of you here, But stop here muse now Juno's rites Waite to be done, extinguish lights, Lest by their glaring is descride The blushing of the bashfull bride. My joy and happy omens meet With pleasure in the geniall sheet. [Let ruffling Eurus in Æolian jayle] Let ruffling Eurus in Æolian jayle Ly close confin'd without maine prise or baile. Come Amphitrite with thy sea greene traine Of Nymphs to trip it o're the liquid plaine, Come Doris with thy watry band, and all The Druid crew Chrysostomaticall. Come Crescis, and sweet tongu'd Cymodocea, With Zantho, and æquoriall Amothea. With golden tressalines Dexamine Come hand in hand both blith Cymothæ. Through Neptunes park this Navy dance before And usher it to Cyprus peeble shore. DEORVM DONA A MASQVE.Presented before Flaminius and Clorinda, King and Queene of Cyprus at their Regall Palace in Nicosia. GENIVS. When Jove, and nature metamorphosed The undigested lump, (which was the bed Of indisposed confusion) a rude load Where scuffling seedes of things misplac't aboad. Where springs, ponds, lakes immense and hewtes curl'd Were with things hot, dry, humid, frigid hurld. So when the game is playd, the Chessmen be Though dignified with names of majestie, Though God-like Kings, or reverend Bishops they, Or honourable Lords be call'd i'th play, Or Knights errand or worthies of the growne, They're altogether into one bag throwne. But to our taske, when out of this dull masse By heavenly Alchymie extracted was A world well orderd, and methodicall, The fire and thin aire were highest place't The solid selfe clog'd earth did lowest fall And was by the vast Ocean imbrac't, In whose larg precincts many sea-girt lands And Islands fenced by salt water stands, Which Amphitrite with her cripst locks hem So various jemmes inlay a diadem, Neptune his tributary gods that graces Gives them the government of these small places, And let them weare their saphrie crownes, and weild Their little tridents in their watry feild; But this faire Isle which of its selfe affordes Matter to build an Ocean furrowing ship From the top gallant to the keeles low bottom, And furnish it with tackling, and munition Without the help of exotick addition. Unto his blew hair'd dieties he quarters, And he himselfe with a brave flying guard Of winged coursers, her ingarison. Then her indulgent guardian provided A ruler worthy of so rare an Isle, But Jove observing his just government Tooke him to his Olympus there to be His colleague, vicegerent, deputy, His life we lov'd, and wisht, but he expir'd Your hapinesse is of our hearts desir'd. And you the orbe where power, and beauty move Faire Queen of Amathusia, and love, Each Subject hath erected on his heart A vestall flaming Altar, to offer up A thankfull sacrifice for your arivall, At this white houre, t'inclose so faire a guest Our Land waxt proud, and I the Genius Am by so great a presence weakt, and glory To bid you welcome in your subjects names, Whose hearts dance in their eyes for joy of you, Their pulses all beat musique, and their blood Beat in their blew-rooft channells a soft measure, Even as the radiant Olympick cole Whose heate thawes annually the icy pole, By his coruscant beames correct the sight, Of mortalls eyes that dare gaze on light, Even so you move in so sublime a spheare With awfull reverence, and regall feare, Majestick Queen, your sacred majestie Fires kindled by your eyes doe qualifie, For you (Adored Cypria) had been The whole worlds Mistris, if no Cyprian Queen. Phœbus and Cynthia of our hemispheare, Father, and Mother, of our fertile Ile, May your admired court, and raigne become The pattern for all Princes imitation And be the coppy Kings strive to write after, Heaven crowne my wish, whilst earth concur to sing Kind fortune fan you with a courteous wing. Enter Fortune conducting fame and vertue. Fortune. Translucent twins of Love, and majestie I that of things ad libitum dispose, And this man elevate, and that depose, I that advanced Servus Tullius That tumbling came into the spacious world, A vassell cadit or cosmopolite. Even to the Apex of all mundan honour, I that cast Mustapha the Ideot From th' Ottoman throne, &amp; sealed Osman there And dandled him in my lubricious armes, Till weary of my dalliance I threw him downe, Invested Mustaph in his pristine state, Reducing Osman to such penurie He beggd a draught of water at a fount, Then out of cruell pitty I commanded An obscure Ianizary to dispatch him, I, that made Arlots Illegitimate son To sway the scepter of rich Albion, I have depos'd my variablenesse And sworne alleagence to faire constancie, I'le never interrupt your happines By any churlish or disasterous frowne, Which oath is as irrivocable as The strickt law of the Meedes and Persians was, About your palaces the yellow streames Of Tagus, Isberus, and Pactolus, Shall run &amp; meet there with the Indian Ganges. Little petty homagers all stubborne Princes Shall prostrate their shining scepters at Your most majestick feet and gredily Shall glory in your royall servitude, Crowns pil'd on crownes shall pave your happy paths, And Captive Kings wait on your chariot. And erect statues to your memoryes Which shall survive Egyptian Pyramids, And last when Hyems hath frozen up the world, And when old palsie time shall droop, and halt Being ore worne, and moatheaten with yeares. Your joyes still bud, and grow, and gemminate And not be capiable to terminate. Fame. Before Joves spangled portalls (with a crew Of bright aeriall soules) I dwell insphear'd Chanting the conquests of the son's of valour And magnifying their great names, which last Unbitten by the canker worme of time, I neere can take a trump to carroll forth, Some royall Potentates heroick name, But Mars still rounds me in the eare, and sayes, Fame sing Flaminius worth, whose mighty facts Hath made the world a register of's acts, Whose manly heart propitious Jove doth blesse With haughty spirit, that spirit with successe, Victorious successe with lasting glory Which glory makes his martiall feates a story, Whose spreading fame with gray hair'd time shall vie And be companion of eternity. When I would blaze a beauty Uenus comes And with her fatall magick charmes me thus, Harke thou repositor of comelinesse, From Albions Isle where silver Thames dos dally With the even bosome of the spungie sands And often wash the fructifying sides Of her beloved bankes, with wanton tides, I have transplanted to my Cyprian Isle Clorinda, from whose fair sun bright eyes Issue such sparkling heart surprising rayes, As proclaime her the wonder of her dayes, Her brow excell's the Rodopeian snow, Her silken haire which in curld ringlets grow Might make so many strings for Cupids bow. Her eyes can make a stubborne souldier melt Although his heart be hearder then his sheild, Each smile of hers hath a magnetick force To attract soules, her Angells voyce can charme A Satyre rude, and rock his wanton soule Into Elizian slumbers, let her be Genophilus the subject of thy song. Erect a temple to her honoured name The Virgin quire shall make it their devotion To pay her gratefull Pæans, and to crowne With ever springing garlands her faire statue; I have descended through the silver orbes To satisfie these dieties, I've tame A thrill resounding trumpet, new, and clean, Lest it it should taint my breath, whilst I blaze forth Your names which as in deep graven characters Shall last for times immortall processe sure, Whilst Phœbus, Phæbe, and nights fry indure. Uertue. Bright ornaments of the heaven covered world To whom the far fam'd Cyprian nation bow I'ts most obsequious, and willing knees, On whose illustrious fronts the regall crowne Imprint no rigorous, and austere frownes Your subjects hopes of joy to batter downe. But whose auspicious, and calmer eyes Pronounceth omens of ensueing joy, And defuse hopes of safety to their hearts, Which pious reverence doth thaw to streames Flowing ith' current of obedience. Your Raigne's become a lecture of pietie Which transfuse through your court an admiration, And Zealous ardour of its imitation, Nay the high towring flames doe penetrate The dapled skie, and make Gods emulate, Jove envy your rare vertues (Potent Prince) And Juno (Mighty Queen) your share of graces, Which make you so resplendent in all places. Now the musick sounded and fortune, fame, and vertue, danced to its measures, Corantoes, Durettoes, Moriscoes, Galliards, and sung thus, Fortune. With gentle starres I will concur in influence, On you of all joyes to confer the confluence. Fame. With every jocand spring your fames shall bud, and grow, No envious gust your fragrant names can make to blow. Uertue. Your loves I'me try'd in hard assayes Majestick paire Now shall a crowne of deathlesse praise adorne your haire. Fortune. Your joyes which on a Helix move no evill shall crosse Till Lachesis webs preys doe prove to Atropos. Uertue. Then Royall Sir, and Regall bride my golden key Shall ope the palace where abide Eternitie.Fame. Your dayes shall daune with every day and shine, and glow Tributes of praise each age shall pay yet still must owe. Exeunt. The Scene was transformed to that part of the Sea, that wastes the Cyprian shore, on the one hand were erected two pedestalls, whereon Captaines lay chained, on the other hand a woman in a sea green drapery heightned with silver, on her head a corona rostrata, with one hand holding the rudder of a ship, with the other a little winged figure with a branch of palme, and a garland, this woman denoted navall victory. When the soft musick sounded, Neptune and a chorus of Marine Nymphs ascended, with a sea triumphe of children riding on sea horses, and young Tritons, with their writhen trumpets, they all sung this ditty. Best of men, and best of Kings, Homage and peace thy Navy brings Where ere she spreads her canvas wings, Thy Foemen when thy flags appeare Are halfe subdued with Panique feare Lest thou towards them thy course shouldst steere. Alas they preliate in vaine 'gainst thy wing'd Pegasean traine Which gives club law upon the maine. We all thy Palizado's be To keep thy ebbing Ocean free From stormes, and filching piracie. A greedy Foe with as small toyle Another land may sack, and spoyle As touch thy sea Nymph guarded soyle. Should we give raines to flouds once more Till earth and sea one visage bore And that Sea knew no bounding shore, Thy moving bowers would in pride Supported by the raging tide Triumphing ore the drownd ball ride. Then would ore plaines and hillocks too Thy wounded pin as to visit goe High mountaines where they once did grow. Exeunt. The Scene changed to a magnificent palace, adorned with al manner of diliciousnesse, Comas appeared &amp; said. Come lets dispeople all foure elements, And when we've ran through all the register Of past delights, lets set and study new ones, Darke vail'd Cotytto stay thy ebon chaire Wherein thou triumphest with Herate And let not nice mourne on the Indian steep Peep from her cabin'd loop hole, let no cock His matins ring, till pomp, and revellry Have tane their fills, with masque, and pagentry. Let midnight see our feast and jollity And weare a blacker maske, as envious Of our dance, jocond rebecks, and wreathed smiles. Now Tellus is arrayd in fresh attire And prickt, and dect with Flora's tapestrie, And each groves Quiristers doe warble anthems And all to grace this nights solemnity. Now that blith youth upon whose clusterd locks A wreath of ivy berries set, have crusht From purple grapes a most Nectarian juce That mortalls may with freedome entertaine Blith joy, and debonair mirth, which againe At this good time to visit mortalls daigne. Musick whose lofty tones grace Princes crown'd Unto this novall coronation sound. Fame with a blast as love as ratling thunder. Proclaime this pompous frolick holy day, That Jeve may know of our quips, and cranks And to beare part in our smooth ditty'd pranks Leave valted heaven, and his skie Roabes put off And pure ambrosial weeds of Iris woof, Attended by Coruscant constellations Who to present shall make it their next taske Before your Maiesties an nother masque.
