      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I., II. RICHARD THE FIRST. BOOK I. ARGUMENT. Proæmium—Sketch of Saladin's plans and conquests, and of the European force opposed to him in Palestine—Effect of Richard's expedition on the Infernal Powers—Council of Dæmons—Moloch sent by Satan to England—He raises Famine, Pestilence and Civil War—Belial, in Palestine, sows corruption and dissention among the Christian leaders—He succeeds in alienating the mind of Philip the French King, who separates himself from the Crusaders, and returns to France—His machinations against Richard, and confederacy with Prince John. I The lion-hearted Monarch, who display'd His banner on Judæa's shore, I sing. Immortal Muse! impart thy pow'rful aid: From the Aonian mount with rapid wing Descending, heav'nly inspiration bring: Teach me to trace th' effects of Austria's hate, And the foul wrongs of Gallia's treach'rous king; To tell how Richard, long oppress'd by fate, O'er adverse hell prevail'd, and grew by suff'rings great. II Twice thro' the Zodiack's bound the glorious sun His progress had fulfill'd and crown'd the year, Twice had the varying months their courses run, Since, circled round by many a gallant peer, Towards Judah's long-insulted coast to steer England's brave King led forth his warlike band; Thither by zeal inspir'd his arms to bear, Where Saladin usurp'd the sacred land, And spoil'd her holy fanes with sacrilegious hand. III O'er Egypt's realm, where Nile's rich waters lave And fertilise her soil, the Sultan reign'd. Mature in counsel, as in action brave, The wide dominion which his arts had gain'd, With tyranny attemper'd he maintain'd: Yet with his ample frontier not content, His swarthy bands with licence unrestrain'd Against the neighbouring potentates he sent, Who 'neath his pow'rful sway in quick succession bent. IV His force resistless first Damascus own'd; And soon beneath his arms the vanquish'd coast Of Syria and the blest Arabia groan'd. Nor o'er Roasia did his conq'ring host Less strike dismay, or realize their boast Of there confirming his despotic will. Gesyra too her antient freedom lost, While, urged by fury and ambition still, He sought with war's alarms far distant Ind to fill. V Ah wherefore did he change his purpos'd course! Why bore he not to that remoter shore His bloody standard and remorseless force! Then Palestine, unstain'd with Christian gore, Had 'scap'd her loss and misery to deplore; Then, prompted onward by his flatt'ring dream The rich and vaunted regions to explore Where Ganges rolls his venerated stream, Ne'er had Judæa's plains confess'd his power supreme. VI But otherwise relentless fate decreed. Ere yet the Pagan monarch bad his train 'Gainst India's distant provinces proceed, He paus'd, uncertain if his new domain At much expence acquir'd he might retain, If in it's centre he a foe should leave, Whose well-known valour might advantage gain, Who from his yoke Damascus might retrieve, And from his hated sway might Syria's coast reprieve. VII Ambition, as on high her wings she spread, Scenes of new conquest and renown display'd. But soon her visionary triumphs fled, When Prudence with a juster hand pourtray'd The Christian Chiefs in martial Pomp array'd, And pictur'd perils which might yet betide. She gain'd her cause, and Saladin obey'd: From every quarter of his empire wide He now resolv'd his bands 'gainst Palestine to guide. VIII Soon as the brazen trumpet's sound was heard, Their warlike King unnumber'd legions join'd. Their banners there th' Egyptian leaders rear'd: Curdistan's sons their savage hordes combin'd; For hope of prey their mountains they resign'd, And in the breeze their varied pennons wav'd: There too their march the Medes prepar'd to wind, And those, whose vallies rich Euphrates lav'd, To grace his proud attempt the doubtful warfare brav'd. IX From Nubia's realm, and from the regions wide Whence Ethiopian Nile derives his source, Her sable offspring Africa supplied. Insidious Parthians thither bent their course: There too the polish'd Arabs led their force; And those in deserts bred, who hardly gain'd Their food precarious and subsistence coarse By watchful toils and pillage unrestrain'd, Mounting their coursers fleet the general cause maintain'd. X As when the ruddy ev'ning gilds the sky, And length'ning shadows o'er the vallies glance, The busy insects in the sunbeams fly, And joy to weave their wanton airy dance, Their countless phalanx seeming now t' advance, Now to retire, as thousands still pursue: So when, drawn forth on Delta's wide expanse, The King survey'd his far assembled crew, With expectation fill'd he grasp'd at triumphs new. XI Such was the foe which Palestine assail'd: Alike resistless in the open field, And war's more subtle courses, he prevail'd. In vain their faulchions did the Christians wield; To his superior fortune forced to yield, Their vanquish'd hosts disgrace and ruin found. Stript of his crown, abandoning his shield, By him Judæa's King in chains was bound, With many a princely Knight in chivalry renown'd. XII The tow'rs of Solyma his sway confess'd: Sidon obey'd his over-whelming hand: Nor could Beritus, by his arms oppress'd, Or Ascalon, his fierce attack withstand. Against Neapolis, by conquest fann'd, He led his host victorious: Jaffa's loss And Cæsarea's fall inspir'd his band; Nor with less praise did fame his triumphs gloss, When from proud Acre's walls he drew the sacred cross. XIII From Libanus to Pharan's desert bare Beneath his power the groaning districts bow'd: In hopeless agony and wild despair The unavailing tear of anguish flow'd. But, while beneath his domination proud The Christians sank oppress'd, their heart-felt woes, Their sorrows which sincere contrition shew'd, To the tribunal of their GOD arose, And aid by Heav'n was sent to check their cruel foes. XIV All Europe own'd the soul-transporting fire: From fertile Lusitania's shore, where reigns Eternal spring, and to his tuneful lyre The watchful shepherd sings his am'rous pains, To where 'midst darkness winter harsh enchains In icy bonds and ever-during snow The bleak and distant hyperborean plains, Each bosom felt th' invigorating glow, Each chieftain urg'd his band their prowess high to shew. XV Not from th' Achaian ports to Ilion's shore A fleet so large and well appointed sail'd, When 'gainst old Priam Greece her vengeance bore, And on Scamander's banks her host detail'd. Less was the force which Rome's proud ramparts scal'd, When savage Attila her towers defac'd, When injured science his attack bewail'd, When sank the glories which her power had grac'd, And wild barbaric hordes her tow'ring fanes debas'd. XVI His German host imperial Frederick led From where proud Rhine his rich dominions lav'd: Full many a subject prince his banner spread, And many a vassal there his ensign wav'd. From Danube's banks the Austrian legions brav'd The unknown war: their long-extended line Confess'd the power of Leopold deprav'd, Who, tho' well skill'd their movements to combine, Spurn'd at all human laws and mock'd the powers divine. XVII The hardy vet'rans from Hungaria's plain March'd, with the bands from rude Bohemia join'd. From rich Burgundia Otho drew his train, And led his force with Flandria's troops combin'd: Otho, than whom none better knew to wind Thro' all the mazes of corruption's round, To purposes of foulest wrong resign'd. 'Midst the confed'rate powers no chief was found Of more impure intent, of maxims more unsound. XVIII From where in Hadria's gulph the Istrian shore Joins with the Carnian and Illyrian coast, Nurs'd 'midst inclement skies and mountains hoar, Forth came a vast and formidable host, Which warlike Conrad led. By fortune toss'd, To aim at regal power he now aspir'd: With artful claims his title weak he gloss'd, And, while ambition's flame his bosom fir'd, He fail'd when most his aid the Christian cause requir'd. XIX Italia's sons the impulse strong confess'd: From Como's lake, and Alps' tremendous height, The daring warriors to the conflict press'd. Ferrara's Duke conven'd his country's might; Those who in Po's deep stream with fond delight Were wont to bathe, or on Clitumnus' bank Beheld their milk-white herds the herbage bite. Calabria's youth increas'd the warlike rank, And those who Tiber's flood in fam'd Campania drank. XX Nor less the polish'd sons of fertile France The gen'rous enterprise preferr'd to share. In close array her troops were seen t' advance, While their rich banners proudly cut the air. Those who the vallies till'd with pious care, Where Seine's slow waters to the ocean creep; And those who press'd the gifts of Bacchus fair, Where Rhone her torrent rolls 'twixt mountains steep, Reigns o'er subjected plains, and thund'ring seeks the deep. XXI These Philip led, of France the pow'rful prince; Who early in the sacred cause engag'd, Yet ceas'd too soon his ardour to evince: In his dark breast ambition wildly rag'd; Pity he scorn'd; no feelings soft assuag'd The settled purpose of his mounting soul; Tho' avarice still a dubious warfare wag'd, And 'slav'd his bosom with her harsh controul, Infusing jealous fears, and framing treasons foul. XXII While in the East, 'gainst Saracenic hosts Th' associate warriors urg'd the frequent fight, The trump of fame to Europe's distant coasts, Well pleas'd their daring conflicts to recite, Proclaim'd their puissance and resistless might. England her monarch's tow'ring worth admir'd; And, while they heard the tale with fond delight, With ardour long unfelt the aged were fir'd, And youthful breasts to deeds of high desert aspir'd. XXIII But not unmix'd with woe the tidings came. Now rumour's voice the story sad detail'd Of Philip's wrongs, and faithless Otho's shame, Who, when stern Saladin their host assail'd, From virtue's cause and vows recorded fail'd. Now of their valiant King expos'd it told To open perils and to treachery veil'd, While his associates base, in treasons bold, Leagued with their Pagan foe, their honour truck'd for gold. XXIV With indignation strong and pity mov'd, Each English breast the painful tale receiv'd. Oft as the fortunes of their Prince belov'd Their memory trac'd, their feeling bosoms heav'd, They breath'd the fruitless sigh, and vainly griev'd: And fancy, sick'ning in her wild career, Such forms of woe as reason ne'er conceiv'd Industrious drew, spectres and phantoms drear, Of power to wring the soul and force th' unwilling tear. XXV Nor did her bodings dire illusive prove. While England's King his host victorious led, Against him Hell's tremendous phalanx strove; Dæmons to crush him foul enchantments shed, And o'er his path perplex'd their engines spread. Him, to the storms of adverse fate betray'd, Remorseless Fiends pursued with vengeance dread, Their deadliest ministers of ill array'd, And, for destruction arm'd, their ruthless power display'd. XXVI From Pandæmonium, where he held his reign, Satan the bold Crusading host beheld: He view'd their high prows cut the foaming main, As with propitious gales their white sails swell'd. With indignation fierce and pride unquell'd Oft did his eye their martial order trace, Which seem'd by fate and succouring heav'n impell'd To hurl destruction on his favour'd race, Their power usurp'd to crush, their prophet to disgrace. XXVII From Europe's clime to Asia's distant coast Vengeful he cast his flaming eyes around, Then quick assembled his infernal host. His voice tremendous shook the vault profound, And, as hell's caverns echo'd back the sound, Dismay and terror fill'd each ruthless breast. Slowly the Monarch rose; he sternly frown'd, And wav'd aloft his snake-encircled crest, As thus in accents harsh the Dæmons he address'd. XXVIII “When to your delegated care I gave “The charge of watching o'er my race select, “I look'd, great Chiefs! for zeal and efforts brave. “But well your sov'reign's mandates ye respect! “Behold yon hostile fleet, whose course direct “Destruction bears 'gainst Saracenic towers; “See how the heavens serene their course protect, “And, as the leaders cheer their warlike powers, “Mark how on every brow vindictive fury lours. XXIX “Is then the mem'ry of your wrongs o'erpast? “Where is the hate resolv'd, the wrathful flame, “Which fir'd th' ætherial race from Heav'n when cast? “Patient of wrong, effeminate and tame, “Of prowess vaunt no more, but bow with shame. “Shall we, to torments doom'd, resign'd, and weak, “Sink in oblivious sloth our well-earn'd fame, “Or boldly daring shall we vengeance seek, “And rush on perils new our great revenge to wreak? XXX “But perils daunt ye, and revenge is cold: “Else here inglorious would ye not remain, “When England's monarch, confident and bold, “To victory leads his proud confed'rate train. “Nor war's rough front, nor dangers can detain “From glory's call that enterprising host. “Oh Chiefs! unmindful of the wrongs which stain “Your lineage high, cease, cease your empty boast, “Let Saladin be crush'd, let Palestine be lost!” XXXI He ceas'd. Abash'd and mute the Dæmons stood, While light'nings blaz'd, and thunders round them broke. Each stubborn Chief, in dark and thoughtful mood, His sov'reign's fury fearful to provoke, In awful silence sought his shame to cloak. But soon, with looks which inward pride express'd, And step assur'd which arrogance bespoke, Moloch, dread prince, advanc'd before the rest, And thus with hurried voice the monarch stern address'd. XXXII “On errors past, and duties ill-perform'd, “Let not, great King! thy censure harsh alight. “Rous'd by thy call, to deeds of vengeance warm'd, “Each Chief infernal burns to prove his might, “And 'gainst the Christian band to urge the fight. “When erst in arms and battle's fierce array “We wag'd proud war on yonder starry height, “Zealous we rush'd thy standards to display, “And mark'd thro' Heav'n's wide plain our desolating way. XXXIII “Impatient still thy dread behest we wait: “Whether on earth to spread destruction wide, “Or bold in conscious strength to tempt our fate, “And, with fresh vigour and new force supplied, “With heav'nly power our contest to decide, “And win the glorious field, or bravely fall. “'Tis thine the movements of thy host to guide: “Our ardent zeal no perils can appal; “For action high we pant, for enterprise we call.” XXXIV As thus he spoke, the Chiefs with threat'ning mien Clash'd their broad shields, and murmur'd hoarse assent; They shook their spears, and wav'd their faulchions keen, And hell's high arch with warlike shouts was rent. So, in the earth's dark womb foul vapours pent In dull inaction waste their influence dread, But should ill-omen'd chance afford them vent, With fury uncontroul'd their force they spread, Scatter destruction round, and death and ruin shed. XXXV In open war the Christians to oppose The stern assembly now resolv'd appear'd, When Satan from his lofty throne arose. “Well pleas'd,” he cried, “brave Spirit! have I heard “Thy proposition bold, to me endear'd “By deep remembrance of my past-gone wrong. “Yet, tho' we once 'gainst Heav'n our standards rear'd, “To us no more such flatt'ring hopes belong, “No more 'tis ours to lead 'gainst Seraph hosts our throng. XXXVI “That those, who shame and endless torments feel, “Should burn a just and great revenge to take, “And to the glorious chance of war appeal, “I marvel not. As from yon sulph'rous lake, “Whence lurid flames arise and steams opake, “I stretch my view across these fearful plains, “Indignant feelings in my breast awake: “I curse the power which here our force detains, “Secure by our defeat, triumphant by our pains. XXXVII “Say, with Heav'n's bolt, or with the pow'rful shock “Of vengeful fires, launc'd by th' unerring hand “Of him, whose word the sources can unlock “Of wrath exhaustless, and on whose command “Myriads of Angels ever watchful stand, “Can we expect successfully to cope? “Let schemes which better suit our force be plann'd; “Such as may give our subtle engines scope, “Whose well-directed aim may crown our anxious hope.” XXXVIII He ended. Belial thus the Peers address'd. “If fame and conquest on our helms to beam “Imperious fate deny, let not the breast, “Which hatred fosters, court an idle dream. “If insufficient prove our force, I deem “'Tis wise to try what counsel may effect. “What tho' wall'd towns impregnable may seem? “Some hidden weakness cunning may detect, “And policy may win, when fails th' attack direct. XXXIX “The Christian chieftains who associate wage “'Gainst Saladin the war, unmov'd will stand, “Tho' powers infernal vent their utmost rage, “While they obedient prove to Heav'n's command. “But note, great Princes, a Confed'rate band “Bears in it's essence seeds of sure decay: “If nurtur'd well, they blossom and expand, “'Till ripen'd Treasons their broad front display, “Reward their planter's care, and all his toils repay. XL “War's doubtful issue then to others leave: “More certain means Corruption's arts secure. “Skilful the erring judgement to deceive, “Be our's the task with hopes and views impure “Each sep'rate leader from his faith t' allure, “And tempt his weaken'd soul his vows to break. “So shall we victory gain compleat and sure, “So shall we vain their preparations make, “Blast their aspiring hopes, their vaunted projects shake.” XLI Up started Satan from his ebon throne: “Belial!” he cried, “with counsels just and wise “Well has thy tongue our line of conduct shewn. “What tho' th' infernal powers in mass arise, “By desperation urg'd to win the prize, “Experience tells the effort will be vain: “But, couch'd in falsehoods and conceal'd by lies, “Safely we work our purposes to gain, “And o'er subjected foes to stretch our ample reign. XLII “Henceforth thy sage conclusions we adopt. “To thee th' important mission we award, “With sophistry, and speech in guile enwrapt, “To tempt the chieftains of the league abhorr'd. “In hell's black register we thus record, “In characters indelible of flame, “Thy plan with more than hellish malice stor'd. “Thro' endless ages thus shall last thy fame, “And oft renew'd success thy high desert proclaim. XLIII “From this shall we new hope and strength derive, “By this the want of equal force supply. “In vain for conquest shall the Christians strive, “Unite their armies, their resources try: “Gain'd by our prosp'rous arts, some false ally “A simulated succour shall display, “And, when the hour of enterprise is nigh, “Desert their standards, and their cause betray. “So shall our plans prevail, so shall their pow'r decay. XLIV “Let this, great chiefs! your suff'ring minds relieve: “Your present pains let this assurance cheer. “Thro' the thick web which fates industrious weave, “Triumphs in ages yet unborn appear. “Hark! the loud yell of regicides I hear, “Who mark their horrid course with blood and fire: “I see rebellion high her standard rear, “I view her spreading far her influence dire, “While to unbounded sway her frantic sons aspire. XLV “As the storm threatens each devoted land, “All Europe arm'd to stem its force behold. “From every region hastes a warlike band: “Again confed'rate Kings, in union bold, “Exchange their faith, their banners proud unfold, “And join the menac'd ruin to avert. “When lo! by envy warp'd, seduc'd by gold, “Apostate chiefs the common cause desert, “And crouch before the foe his fury to divert. XLVI “What glorious scenes of misery now succeed! “Before my eyes what bloody torrents roll! “I hear the victims sigh, I see them bleed! “Their piercing shrieks transport my raptur'd soul! “The pow'rs of hell, surmounting all controul, “In tenfold terrors clad direct the fight, “And spread contagion dire from pole to pole! “Death shakes his dart—but ah! before my sight “The flatt'ring vision fades and vanishes in night!” XLVII Th' assembled chieftains sat in wonder lost, And joy unusual fir'd each rugged breast, As thus the prescient King proclaim'd his boast. Silent awhile he stood, by thought oppress'd, Then wav'd his hand, and thus the pow'rs address'd. “The purpose of our council to resume, “And plan our great design, behoves us best. “Inspir'd by fate new courage we assume, “To urge destruction on, and seal the Christians' doom. XLVIII “Belial! to thee th' auspicious thought we owe: “Be thine it's execution to command. “Where proudly wave the banners of our foe, “Where seek their fleets the vainly promis'd strand, “Repair with rapid wing: in every band “Infuse suspicions, scatter doubts around, “And realize the mischiefs thou hast plann'd; “With mad ambition's sting each leader wound, “And av'rice base implant in every heart unsound. XLIX “While Belial thus his deeply laid design “In Palestine pursues, be thine the care, “Moloch! with his thy efforts to combine. “Haste, potent chief! to England's shores repair: “Let her hell's direst dispensations share! “Let Civil Discord shake her troubled state, “And desolation's fangs her bosom tear. “So shall her monarch learn what ills await “From Satan's power contemn'd and hell's immortal hate.” L He spoke. The Chiefs proclaim'd their glad assent, While Dæmons rais'd their loud triumphant cry. Now, to fulfil their Sov'reign's foul intent, The chosen pair direct their course on high, And thro' th' empoison'd air their pinions ply. So, when half famish'd vultures scent their food, From their lone seat with fell resolve they fly, Tear their still quiv'ring prey, exult in blood, And train to deeds of death their young rapacious brood. LI The Fiends, intent their object to attain, The gloom surmounted and beheld the day: On Calpe's height they stood, as o'er the main The rising sun disclos'd his new-born ray. They view'd the wide seas which before them lay, Where many a stately bark was seen to glide, And thro' the heaving waters cut its way: Where England's banner with becoming pride And pomp superior seem'd o'er ocean to preside. LII “To Acre's towers, where now the Christian foe “The Saracenic force beleagur'd hold,” Belial exclaim'd, “on high intent I go: “To where yon orb illumes the sky with gold, “And mounting soars his splendours to unfold, “My course is bent. Thy travel to perform “O'er northern waves must stretch thy pinions bold. “Haste then to raise and to direct the storm, “Spread hell's dominion wide, and Albion's realm deform!” LIII He said; and rising from the mountain's brow Towards the red east he bent his vent'rous wing; There to fulfil his desolating vow, There by his impious arts distress to bring On the Crusading host and England's King, And hell's tremendous vengeance to disclose. Meantime, fierce Moloch with exulting spring From Calpe's craggy summit furious rose, While ruin led the way, and marshall'd all her woes. LIV High in the troubled air the Dæmon rode. Hispania's fruits and Lusitania's bloom Shrank blasted where his direful influence flow'd. As o'er th' Atlantic vast he wav'd his plume, Darkness obscur'd the sun, and thro' the gloom Deep thunders roll'd, and livid lightnings play'd: The mounting billows op'd their wat'ry tomb, And to th' affrighted mariner display'd Pale death's terrific form, by fear more ghastly made. LV On the dread scene with joy malign he gaz'd: And now, to Albion's coast approaching nigh, While warring elements around him blaz'd, O'er her high cliffs he cast his vengeful eye, As proudly rang'd they rear'd their summits high, To check the waves and stem their boist'rous force. Vain now their power his terrors to defy, Who, for destruction arm'd, pursued his course, Deaf to compassion's voice, and heedless of remorse. LVI In night's dark horrors clad, in clouds array'd, He pass'd their tow'ring fronts with stern disdain; Then hov'ring hung, and for a while survey'd Each boldly rising hill and fertile plain, Where laughing plenty held her peaceful reign. In rich luxuriance cloath'd and seemly pride The far-spread vallies shew'd their waving grain, While, on each flow'ry bank and mountain's side, Rich food for flocks and herds the herbage green supplied. LVII 'Mid the wide landscape, drawn from many a spring With winding course majestic rivers flow'd, On which, while Zephyr shook his fav'ring wing, Unnumber'd vessels richly freighted rode, Bearing from ports remote their precious load. Around the varied habitation rose; The peaceful cot, of virtue the abode, The humble village, seat of calm repose, The city strongly fenced against incroaching foes. LVIII Their useful labours freemen there fulfill'd; They train'd the steer, the vigorous steed controul'd, The teeming earth with toil industrious till'd, Tended their fleecy care to field or fold, Or chac'd the savage tribe with ardour bold. From av'rice free, by no vain hopes allur'd, Their days in joy, and bless'd contentment roll'd, While manly worth the well-earn'd meed procur'd, And female excellence domestic bliss insur'd. LIX Moloch the happy scene intent survey'd. If e'er compassion ruthless fiends could know, If e'er the voice of pity they obey'd, Or felt the force of mercy's gen'rous glow, His hand had spar'd the fabric to o'erthrow. But his stern heart the impulse strong defied: Eager his malice foul and pow'r to shew, His rugged bosom heav'd with furious pride, He gaz'd with vengeance fir'd, and thus indignant cried. LX “Must we be doom'd to never-ending pain “While men, whom Heav'n created to supply “Our vacant heritage, at ease remain? “Lost in delights with angels shall they vie, “Mock at our hatred, and our power defy? “Shall they with us to meet in conflict dare, “Provoke our wrath, and tempt our vengeance high? “Hell, ope thy gates! Thy engines dire prepare! “Ye fiends infernal haste, revenge and death to bear!” LXI He said, and whirl'd his flaming brand around. From Hell's abyss a Spectre gaunt appear'd; Her squalid brows a snaky circlet crown'd, Dropping foul venom o'er her eye lids-blear'd, While far and near their hissings loud were heard. Fleshless her limbs, her visage ghastly shew'd; In her right-hand a pois'nous dart she rear'd; Her locks dishevell'd like a meteor flow'd, As with intent accurs'd o'er England's realm she strode. LXII Tow'rds the black north her jav'lin dire she threw. From icy chains releas'd, the furious blast Her mandate to fulfil impatient flew. O'er the devoted country as it pass'd, The forest's honours low on earth it cast, And lordly castles levell'd with the ground. The mountains totter'd from their centres vast, While with rude havock from their beds profound The foaming waters torn spread desolation round. LXIII Where vegetation shew'd its luscious store, Where blush'd rich fruits or wav'd the harvest brown, The raging torrents quick destruction bore. No more the peasant's hopes with plenty crown His ruin'd barns and granaries o'erthrown: Aghast he stands, as with resistless force His flocks and herds the whirlpool hurries down, Drowning their helpless cries with murmurs hoarse, As to the deep it rolls it's wild o'erwhelming course. LXIV Thus when disease, some fever'd wretch t' oppress, Deludes his senses with a flattering dream, His melting soul extatic visions bless, He rules ideal realms with sway supreme, And fancy gay prolongs th' enchanting theme 'Till morn awakes him agony to know: So, when the sun again unveil'd his beam, He shone but misery and distress to shew, Proud England's glories chang'd for ruin, want and woe. LXV Far as the eye could stretch, the ravag'd plain Shew'd blank and desert, as in war's dread hour, When adverse hosts their contest dire maintain, When on some frontier weak they ruthless shower The wanton rage of desolating power, And blast the joys which Heav'n design'd for man. With aspect haughty and malignant lour As gaz'd the Fiend, across her visage wan A momentary glow of joy infernal ran. LXVI But soon return'd the terrors of her brow. With pride augmented and destructive tread Wildly she rang'd her puissance curs'd to shew, While angry Moloch wav'd his faulchion dread, And from his airy seat new horrors shed. Hell felt the impulse: from her caverns foul Black Pestilence uprear'd her fatal head, Of power to wring with woe the stricken soul, T' arrest the vital flood, and nature's laws controul. LXVII She stalk'd where Famine held her wasteful reign. While far around her baleful eyes she threw, And gaz'd enraptur'd on the ruin'd plain, From lips obscene a vapour dire she blew. Thro' the wide air the sick'ning influence flew, Charg'd with corruption and diseases pale, With unknown dangers and afflictions new. Ah woe surpassing! from the Heav'n-born gale To draw the source of death, contagion to inhale! LXVIII Jointly their hateful war the Dæmons wag'd. Where'er by Famine wrought prevail'd the dearth, Insatiate Pestilence with fury rag'd, And spread destruction o'er the tainted earth. Nor sex, nor age, nor beauty's charms, nor worth, From her oppressive grasp avail'd to save; Nor gilded palace, nor low village hearth, Nor tow'ring castle's height protection gave; One fate awaited all, one undistinguish'd grave. LXIX Where, with content and independence bless'd, The humble swain enjoy'd his calm retreat, Where, when he turn'd his toil-spent limbs to rest, His heart with transport undissembled beat His wife belov'd, his smiling babes to meet, Affliction reign'd, and sorrow spread her gloom. No more their innocent endearments greet: Wrapt in one sad inevitable doom, Mute are their tuneful tongues, and blasted is their bloom. LXX As o'er the ravag'd and deserted plain The famish'd burgher looks with fearful care, Hopeless he turns his mournful home to gain, Where from his scanty store their meagre fare His anxious wife and children weak prepare. With dart uprais'd Despair his steps attends: Condemn'd their aggravated woes to share, O'er their pale corses as he weeping bends, Disease invades his heart, and thro' his veins ascends. LXXI Where, far from peopled haunts, in vale obscure, The shepherd seeks his blushing maid to move With ardent vows and supplication pure; Together as thro' lengthen'd meads they rove, Or seek some yet undesolated grove Where woodbines sweet their circling branches wreath, One fate pursues their unpropitious love: Contagion hovers in their panting breath, Each sigh with poison fraught, each fond embrace with death. LXXII The crouded mart, where erst with eager haste The early citizens repair'd for food, Shew'd now a vacant and deserted waste. No more, as at the altar high he stood, The holy priest adorers prostrate view'd When solemn rose the pealing organ's sound. Dead were the ties of friendship and of blood; The heart's best feelings were by sorrows drown'd, And doubt and wild despair their empire spread around. LXXIII Moloch well-pleas'd the work of death survey'd. “Far as infernal might extends,” he cried, “Well has my vengeful fury been display'd. “But tho' 'tis our's to launch destruction wide, “To rule the storm, and in the whirlwind ride, “Beyond the bound'ry fix'd our hate to shew “A power to us superior has denied. “Curs'd be the mandate, which forbids to flow “The ample tide of ill, th' o'erwhelming stream of woe! LXXIV “Cease then, ye Fiends, your further task to urge, “Since Heav'n prevails your efforts to repel, “And checks the influence of your ruthless scourge. “But haste, ye potent ministers of Hell! “Rebellion bloody! Civil Discord fell! “Hither with vengeance trebly arm'd repair: “Unite the mass of England's woes to swell; “Exert your power, your engines dire prepare, “So shall her absent King his country's ruin share.” LXXV The Fiends obedient to his dictates flew, And rush'd to execute his dread command. Around them throng'd vain Hopes, and Schemes untrue, Falsehood sly smiling with demeanour bland, Pale Av'rice, clenching fast his trembling hand, Ambition fierce, and Envy's visage lean: Revenge and Malice led their desp'rate band, While Jealousy advanc'd with aspect green, And foul Ingratitude uprear'd her form obscene. LXXVI Tow'rds potent Moloch press'd the impious host. As their broad pinions cut the murky sky, They hail'd their Chieftain with insulting boast, And join'd in chorus loud with daring cry Heav'n and it's powers eternal to defy. The Dæmon rais'd his hand their shouts to still, And thus address'd the crew with accents high. “In silence listen to your Sov'reign's will: “Learn your appointed task of evil to fulfil. LXXVII “Behold yon ravag'd plains, yon desert wide, “Where with wild licence and remorseless sway “Black Pestilence and Famine proudly stride. “While thus their finish'd labours they display, “While death and havock signalize their way, “And Albion's realm our power destructive rues, “'Tis your's fresh woes to pour and new dismay; “'Tis your's her sons with falsehoods to abuse, “In each enfeebled soul suspicions to infuse. LXXVIII “Thus Satan bids. While on Judæa's shore “Th' associate Chiefs victorious warfare hold, “And Richard's might the Saracens deplore, “Be here the standard of revolt unroll'd. “In John's base soul, revengeful, dark and cold, “The smother'd embers of ambition fan; “Teach him, by av'rice moved, in treason bold, “Of favours reckless, to assist our plan, “And crown the glorious work, which Hell's dread pow'rs began. LXXIX “Haste then the mighty mischief to compleat: “Let Civil Discord England's bosom rend. “Forc'd from his views of conquest to retreat, “His crown to save, his empire to defend, “Vengeance shall on the monarch's steps attend: “Augmented ills the baffled prince shall know; “Hell shall against him hosts of dæmons send, “Till, victim of his unrelenting foe, “In grief his days shall pass, his nights consume in woe.” LXXX Thus spake the Dæmon. The assembly heard His mandate stern, and joy malign express'd: Then, as their inauspicious wings they rear'd, Their fatal course tow'rds Albion they address'd, While thunders hoarse their influence dire confess'd, And livid light'nings shot their murd'rous flame. High beat with conscious pride fierce Moloch's breast: To Satan's court his flight he bent, to claim The guerdon of his toils, the trophied meed of fame. LXXXI While thus his vengeful mission he fulfill'd, And spread wide ruin over England's land, Remorseless Belial, well in falsehoods skill'd, Urg'd his destructive toils. His practis'd hand Soon chang'd the fortunes of the Christian band. In every breast were lurk'd impure desire The latent sparks of discontent he fann'd, Led them 'gainst England's Monarch to conspire, And kindled in their minds ambition's madd'ning fire. LXXXII But from the Gallic King's perfidious soul, Rankling with envy, his best hopes arose: O'er his foul heart he held supreme controul; 'Twas there he fix'd, 'twas him the Dæmon chose To rescue Hell's allies and Richard's foes. Him not alone the ties of honour bound, The calls of duty, or the Christian woes; But vows of firm record, with faith unsound At Heav'n's high altar pledg'd, and with Heav'n's sanction crown'd. LXXXIII Him to seduce prevail'd th' insidious Fiend, And proudly triumph'd in his foul deceit. In his entangled soul he sought to blend Suggestions base, which might his judgment cheat, And his long-cherish'd views of fame defeat. The rank pre-eminent and actions rare Of England's Sov'reign oft would he repeat, And with his own diminish'd state compare, Mingling reflections sad with envy and despair. LXXXIV Then, when with grief his lab'ring bosom heav'd, And wounded pride it's wonted aid refus'd, With brighter hopes the Fiend his mind reliev'd; Now with ambitious phantoms he amus'd, And now with views of gain his soul abus'd. He whisper'd reasons and pretences feign'd, By which his recreant flight might be excus'd, Of state necessity, and treasures drain'd, And calls of high import which could not be explain'd. LXXXV Nought now remain'd th' Apostate to delay: With honour blasted and deserv'd disgrace, To France, by Belial led, he took his way. There, in retirement plung'd, with minions base, Measures of vengeful hate he sought to trace. His cause to prop, his breach of faith to hide, And by dispensing power his fears to chase, To Celestine he craftily applied. In vain: the Pontiff just his impious suit denied. LXXXVI When thus the Church refus'd his views to aid, His bosom with augmented malice swell'd: And now his rancour fearless he displayed, Avow'd his guilt, and conscience proudly quell'd. Longchamp, who late in troubled England held Vice-regal power, by foul offences stain'd, Who, to forsake the realm by force compell'd, Had since in France exil'd and poor remain'd, The guide of his intents perfidious he retain'd. LXXXVII While, at the head of England's councils plac'd, He sway'd the realm in delegated state, With papal arms and power legantine grac'd, He aim'd at regal pomp, and mock'd at fate. Full oft he strove in arrogant debate With John, the brother of his absent lord, Who, with like passions and like views elate, Disdain'd a blind submission to afford, But oft with taunts replied, and rais'd his vengeful sword. LXXXVIII From Albion driv'n with contumelious scorn, Forc'd to resign his ill-conducted sway, To France he came a fugitive forlorn. Ready, as int'rest prompted, to display Tyrannic pride, or meanly to obey, To John he now with low submission bent. Anxious his absent brother to betray, To shake his realm, and seize the crown intent, The Prince a fav'ring ear to his proposals lent. LXXXIX For now the Fiends, whom Moloch left in trust O'er England's plains rebellion's flame to spread, Had gain'd dominion o'er his soul unjust. With subtle skill his daring hopes they fed, And, while around their spells accurs'd they shed, For deeds of foul import his breast they steel'd: With crowns ideal they adorn'd his head, And tempting baits of fancied power reveal'd, While the barb'd hook within they artfully conceal'd. XC Th' auspicious moment Philip gladly hail'd. He charg'd the crafty priest his terms to bear (In guise assum'd and with concealment veil'd) By which he sought the recreant Prince t' ensnare. He proffer'd him the hand of Alice fair, And all the rich domains of England's throne, Should he the means of quick revolt prepare: While John his high supremacy should own, And fealty swear and pay due homage for his crown. XCI Had John e'er felt the force of honour's laws, Such terms with warmth indignant he had spurn'd: But terms like these accorded with his cause. Soon as the project of the league he learn'd, His thanks to Gallia's Monarch he return'd, And in his guileful proffer acquiesc'd. And now with hopes of sudden sway he burn'd; Visions of power his working mind oppress'd, And mad ambition's plans inflam'd his trait'rous breast. END OF BOOK I. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. Philip invades Normandy—John's revolt in England— His Army and Confederates—Progress of his Rebellion— Operations of Queen Elinor and the Regents.—Leicester brings intelligence of Richard's intended return—General expectation occasioned by it—Appearance of the Royal Fleet —Its arrival—Queen Berengaria lands—Meeting between her and Elinor—Hubert narrates the misfortunes which attended their voyage from the Holy Land—Separation of Richard, and his rumoured Shipwreck on the Dalmatian Coast—Debate respecting the means of preserving the safety of the realm, and the measures to be taken for discovering the fate of the King—Blondel offers to go in search of him—His proposal is accepted. I Now, urg'd by Dæmons, spread insatiate war. O'er the rich plains of Normandy it rag'd, As Philip led his murd'rous force, and far In work of ruin and of death engag'd. His fury pitiless no tears assuag'd; In vain th' imploring maid protection claim'd, The infant smil'd, or bow'd the helpless ag'd: He mark'd his way with cruelty untam'd, By savage hope of prey and thirst of blood inflam'd. II Meantime, supplied with leaders for his force, Who arms convey'd and store of Gallic gold, John felt no sense of duty or remorse, Nor check'd his foul career by caution cold. Daring in ill, in trait'rous mischief bold, He stood unmask'd, and Richard's pow'r defied. The fatal standard of revolt unroll'd Wav'd o'er the harrass'd realm with gloomy pride, Denouncing future woes and horrors yet untried. III No name of high renown his numbers grac'd, No knightly worth his enterprise adorn'd. True to their King, by treasons undebas'd, While England's Peers the Prince's conduct mourn'd, They shunn'd his councils and his proffers scorn'd: But such as crimes for tumult had prepar'd, Such as foregone experience had not warn'd, Who peril's front for hope of booty dar'd, Rush'd at the cry of war, and to his host repair'd. IV These, rude in fight, to deeds of arms unus'd, The Gallic Chiefs to rule obedient made, And to just rank and discipline reduc'd. But he, whom tribes of hardy Welsh obey'd, Llewellyn proud, brought more efficient aid. From Conway's flood, and Snowdon's long-drawn height, From the rich vale where winding Severn stray'd, And where mild Clwyd roll'd with fond delight, Th' assembled warriors rais'd their banners for the fight. V From where his dyke the Saxon Offa drew, And Brythyn rears his bulk abrupt and dread, To join Llewellyn's host the bowmen flew. Where Caeder Idris lifts his forked head, Where foaming Dee tears o'er her craggy bed, And where Llangollen, blest secluded shade! Smiles 'midst embattled rocks around her spread, Each ready Chief Llewellyn's voice obey'd, And led his vassals bold, and high his shield display'd. VI On ev'ry mountain's side, on ev'ry plain, The minstrels rais'd the soul-inspiring song. As from their fervid strings awoke the strain, It bore remembrance of resentments strong, Of glories past, of unrequited wrong, And rous'd to deeds of vengeance and of blood. The mad'ning influence seiz'd th' attendant throng, Each manly bosom glow'd with hope renew'd, And own'd th' enchanting sway of music's powerful flood. VII From times remote, between the neighb'ring pow'rs Discord had reign'd, and ever-during hate: Their confines, guarded by unnumber'd tow'rs, Shew'd deadly proofs of long and fierce debate, Which sprung from jealous fears and feuds innate. Llewellyn now the glad occasion seiz'd, When civil warfare shook the English state: Vengeful he led his warlike bands, well pleas'd On England's plains to glut his fury unappeas'd. VIII As when a trav'ller lone, 'mid winter's snow, Pursues his midnight way with doubtful feet, And o'er some wild heath moves with progress slow; Should from the darken'd sky new tempests beat, In vain he seeks a friendly roof to meet, In vain with piteous cry for help he calls: Aghast he stands, unable to retreat; Grief rends his heart, despair his soul appals, He staggers, and entranc'd in death's embrace he falls. IX Such was the state of England's hapless realm. Where ruthless Pestilence triumphant reign'd, And Famine join'd her glories to o'erwhelm, Pangs more severe to crown her woes remain'd. Urg'd by the pow'rs of Hell, with blood distain'd, Her fatal torch on high Rebellion wav'd, And widely rang'd with fury unrestrain'd: O'er heaps of slain she held her course deprav'd, While in th' encrimson'd flood her limbs obscene she lav'd. X Her outspread pinions cut the troubled air, And vengeance lighten'd from her baleful eye, As her foul glances scowl'd o'er England fair. Tow'rds the rich vales on Trenta's banks which lie She flew, while loud she rais'd her fearful cry, Pregnant with fate, prophetical of woes. 'Gainst Fiends combin'd their arts accurs'd to ply, In vain did Nottingham her tow'rs oppose: Her ill-defended gates receiv'd her monarch's foes. XI Nor stay'd the Dæmon. To Llewellyn's force, Whose rapid movements spread alarm around, She bent incessant her vindictive course. Inspir'd by her their march the rebels wound. Where Lancaster, by frowning bulwarks crown'd, O'erlooks the deep, she led the conq'ring host: And Windsor, weak and unprotected found, And Wallingford, by fraud and treason lost, Increas'd th' usurper's pride and justified his boast. XII Now, swifter than the angry bolt which cleaves, When charg'd with wrath divine, the nitrous air, The basely-yielded battlements she leaves. Where on the southern coast, abrupt and bare St. Michael's stubborn rocks the ocean dare, Mock at its fruitless rage, and spurn its sway, She hastens the assailant's toils to share. There, as with potent spells she spreads dismay, The walls which storms defied degenerate fears betray. XIII Well did the Fiend her hateful task perform; Far did her desolating power prevail: Uncheck'd she rul'd the wide-extending storm, While Hell's dire chorus join'd her work to hail, As borne aloft, and mounting in the gale, Her mandates to fulfil they ruthless flew; And, charg'd with many an ill-boding tale, Her ghastly-sounding trumpet Rumour blew, And scatter'd mischiefs strange, and terrors round her threw. XIV Where'er with foul intent she steer'd her course, Her cry portentous doubts and fears awoke. Now of John's host, now of Llewellyn's force, And now of Philip's puissant bands she spoke; Now, in false semblance their designs to cloak, She told of dangers which the state oppress'd, Of fancied ills, and harsh oppression's yoke: Each casual woe in colours dire she dress'd, To check reviving hope, and pang the cred'lous breast. XV While Treason thus advanc'd with progress bold, And menac'd England's throne, the Chiefs august, To whom their King had giv'n his power to hold, With watchful care discharg'd the sacred trust. No weak alarm, no momentary gust Of partial discontent their toils requir'd; But ruin widely spread, ambition's lust By hopes intemp'rate and successes fir'd, And Hell's tremendous pow'rs against the realm conspir'd. XVI Four Chiefs compos'd the council of the state, By absent Richard nam'd his power to bear. Of these the first in rank and order sate Rouen's wise Prelate; well his judgment clear The bark of state thro' troubled seas could steer: To him the chief direction was assign'd; While Durham's Bishop, and the bold Brywere, With brave Fitz-Peter, in the trust were join'd, And for the public cause their active zeal combin'd. XVII With high pre-eminence and station grac'd, The royal Elinor her state maintain'd, By Richard's filial love as Regent plac'd. Her kind maternal cares his youth had train'd, Nurs'd every virtue, every fault restrain'd, And trac'd his path to glory and renown. Ambition wild and passions strong had stain'd Her earlier years; but now, more temp'rate grown, She wisely rul'd the realm, and guarded well the crown. XVIII Soon as Rebellion rear'd her hateful head, With prudent care the means of war she plann'd. From his remote domains Fitz-Peter led Of northern warriors a determin'd band, Llewellyn's rude irruption to withstand: While, London to protect from arts undue, From every quarter of his wide command Brywere his well-appointed legions drew, The recreant Prince to check, and crush his desperate crew. XIX While these prepar'd in contest rude to meet, While high in air their adverse banners swell'd, The Queen, at Westminster's imperial seat, With the remaining Chiefs assembly held. From the deluded people they repell'd The arts employ'd their senses to enslave; And, as they faction's daring efforts quell'd, To their mov'd souls they glad assurance gave Of Richard's quick return his suff'ring realm to save. XX The flatt'ring rumour soon obtain'd belief: For now arriv'd from Judah's distant coast Leicester's brave Earl, and many a gallant chief. Of Richard's worth they spoke with heart-felt boast, Who, tho' by adverse fate and treach'ry cross'd, Ne'er ceas'd his matchless valour to display. They told, that, ere they left the vet'ran host, A mighty fleet in Acre's harbour lay, The King and all his force tow'rds England to convey. XXI Reviving Hope each loyal bosom cheer'd: With freshen'd zeal she spread her joys around, And wove her wreaths and fancied trophies rear'd. Trophies how vain! and wreaths how fading found! Thus, when by ice and ocean's terrors bound, Some fog-drawn Island greets the seaman's sight, His heart expands, he hails th' enticing ground; When lo! in clouds ascends the vision bright, Melts from his anxious eye, and vanishes in night! XXII Such was the scene which Hope transported sketch'd, Of triumphs new and vainly promis'd good. Along th' embattled cliffs, which, proudly stretch'd, Oppos'd their barrier to the billows rude, And, reckless of the idly threat'ning flood, Guarded fair England with their bulwarks steep, Expecting crouds with fond impatience stood: Ere morn approach'd they rush'd their watch to keep, Nor ceas'd to gaze 'till night in darkness cloath'd the deep. XXIII When, 'cross the green waves as it faintly glanc'd, Was seen some half-obscur'd and distant sail, Which to the thickly-peopled shore advanc'd, It's bosom swelling with the fav'ring gale, High rose the shout it's bless'd approach to hail. Fleet was the joy which fancy thus pursued! Vain was the wish encourag'd but to fail! Yet still the anxious eye it's search renew'd, And Hope still unsubdued fresh disappointment woo'd. XXIV At length, declining from his noon-tide seat, The orb of day with milder lustre glow'd, When widely rang'd appear'd a gallant fleet. As o'er the waves triumphantly it rode, High in the air the crimson pennants flow'd, And, as by Zephyr urg'd, aloft they stream'd, The proud emblazonments of England shew'd. On every deck unnumber'd helmets gleam'd, And corslets richly chas'd with strong effulgence beam'd. XXV Th' admiring croud beheld them with delight, And hail'd their blest approach with loud acclaim. While some still gaz'd and hung upon the sight, And fondly call'd on each endearing name Long lost to love, tho' dignified by fame, Others, impatient to the Queen to bear The welcome tidings, and her thanks to claim, Rush'd from the summits, emulous to share Her triumphs long obscur'd by sorrow and despair. XXVI As from the wond'rous tube th' electric fire By strong collision forc'd pervades each hand Which grasps in concert the conducting wire, So from the heights and thickly crouded strand Shouts of new transport fill'd th' exulting land. With raptur'd ear Hope caught the pleasing sound, And, as with mounting wing the air she fann'd, She breath'd her notes of extacy around, Of pow'r to raise the soul and treason to confound. XXVII Meantime, their course the lordly vessels kept. As thro' the tranquil deep they cut their way, Their pennants o'er the curling billows swept, Or wanton'd in the air with am'rous play. Now Dover's stately cliffs, whose dread array Frown'd o'er the subject waves, they leave behind: Now, as their lab'ring prows the helm obey, And as their white sails quiver in the wind, They hail old Thames, too long for distant war resign'd. XXVIII Borne on his placid bosom they advanc'd, While on the varied shores on either hand With eager eye and fond delight they glanc'd. But soon, where Greenwich crowns the Kentish strand, On Shooter's verdant top they saw expand The royal standard. Proudly o'er the height It wav'd in air, by gentlest breezes fann'd. A general shout proclaim'd th' auspicious sight, Each warlike heart confess'd a patriot's warm delight. XXIX The shores re-echo'd with the joyful cry: Thro' the throng'd camp unbounded transport spread, While Zephyrs, sporting in the midway sky, Caught the enliv'ning sound, and fondly shed Their joys inspiring. O'er the drooping head Of royal Elinor their influence fell, What time, oppress'd by care and anguish dread, In council close she sought the means to quell The menac'd scene of blood, the deep laid plan of hell. XXX Upstarting from her couch, with hurried voice, “Chieftains!” she cried, “heard ye the welcome sound? “Hence terrors vain! let England now rejoice! “Richard returns, by fame and glory crown'd, “Rebellion's rash abettors to confound. “Hark how again his much lov'd, honour'd name “Throughout the camp is echo'd, while around “Exulting bands their loyalty proclaim, “All emulous to pay their homage to his fame! XXXI “Their conscious hearts their Monarch's worth confess, “His force in arms, his triumphs o'er the foe: “And shall a Mother be the last to bless “Her valiant son, or, while her fond tears flow, “Delay the feelings of her heart to shew? “Ah! let me hasten to his dear embrace! “And, while our souls with speechless raptures glow, “Be mine th' extatic transport to retrace “Those virtues which adorn the noblest of his race!” XXXII Thus spoke the Queen; and, issuing from the tent, She cross'd the camp, and tow'rds the verdant plain Which lay out stretch'd beneath her steps she bent. Meanwhile of warriors an illustrious train Advancing throng'd, impatient to regain Their Prince rever'd: no more, oppress'd by care, Suspense their breasts consum'd with ling'ring pain; Gladly they sought the present bliss to share, And, led by him they lov'd, new triumphs to prepare. XXXIII Th' exulting band the summit now had clear'd, When lo! as if on import high intent, Approaching from the river's side appear'd A troop tumultuous. Up the steep ascent Th' impatient croud their hurrying footsteps bent. Wild was their mien, and frantic seem'd their air: Thro' mingled murmurs rose their loud lament; Some struck their breasts, some tore their flowing hair, And some high Heav'n address'd in shrieks of mad despair. XXXIV A female form advanc'd before the rest, In habits rich and royal state array'd: A sanguine cross depended on her breast; On her fair brow a diadem display'd It's brilliant orb, and in the sun-beams play'd. She droop'd with grief subdued and speechless woe; While on her steps two sad attendants stay'd, Whose pious sorrows seem'd like her's to flow, As tow'rds the camp they mov'd with progress sad and slow. XXXV “What means this mournful train,” exclaim'd the Queen, “Why raise they thus their soul-appalling cry, “What new-born woe portends their sorrowing mien? “Will fate relentless still my suit deny; “Still from my grasp must bliss expected fly, “And hope protracted still delusive prove? “Mark! how again with wild and haggard eye “Yon weeping fair one seeks the heav'ns to move, “And rears her trembling hands, and raves of hopeless love! XXXVI “And now, behold! on us with glances keen “Her look she fixes; now, with anxious haste “Tow'rds us she bends her way. 'Tis Richard's Queen! “His Berengaria lov'd! his consort chaste! “She comes! no longer let us idly waste “The awful moment big with England's fate. “Howe'er our future prospects may be trac'd, “Tho' unfelt horrors may the realm await, “Unaw'd the stroke we'll meet, and mock at fortune's hate!” XXXVII Scarce had she ended, when approaching near To her embrace the lovely mourner sprung. Entranc'd with woe and agonizing fear, Each on the other's bosom speechless hung, While strong contending passions chain'd each tongue, And tears refus'd their succour to impart. At length, her breast with pangs convulsive wrung, “Here, here,” cried Elinor, “infix thy dart! “Here strike, nor dread to wound a mother's sorrowing heart! XXXVIII “Say, lives my Richard! Where is England's King? “Pity the anguish of my lab'ring soul, “And ease the tortures from suspense which spring! “Has war's fell chance, have treason's workings foul “Prevail'd his course of glory to controul? “No—in the purpled field, 'midst carnage dread, “Methinks I see, while thunders round him roll, “Immortal spirits hover o'er his head, “And 'gainst remorseless fate their shields protecting spread!” XXXIX “Oh! may indeed the hand of Heav'n defend “His sacred life!” the weeping Queen replied, “May angels o'er his path their cares extend, “And fav'ring seraphs still his footsteps guide! “Whether thro' oceans turbulent and wide “His light bark dances on the treach'rous wave, “Or, 'mid new toils and perils yet untried, “He lives some tyrant's cruelty to brave, “May Heav'n's propitious pow'r my suff'ring hero save! XL “On distant coasts, 'mid climes severe and rude, “Where war's dread fiend her utmost malice drain'd, “One course, unaw'd by perils we pursued, “While hope still smil'd, and love his sway maintain'd. “Hubert! who long with constancy unstain'd “Thy gallant lord hast serv'd, the chance relate, “Which, ere the shores of England we regain'd, “Forc'd him, the victim of remorseless hate, “Far from my constant arms again to tempt his fate.” XLI “A mournful tale,” said Hubert, “you demand. “When by the falsehood of his base allies, “By war's fell chance which thinn'd his suff'ring band, “And by the want of long desir'd supplies, “Richard was forc'd to quit his wish'd-for prize, “And peace with vanquish'd Saladin to make, “From Acre's harbour, where superbly rise “The tow'rs which erst his valour taught to shake, “Tow'rd England's lov'd domain he sought his course to take. XLII “Vast was the fleet and royally it shew'd; “Around the standard which majestic wav'd, “Aloft in air two hundred pennants flow'd. “Those whom the fost'ring hand of Heav'n had sav'd, “When in the battle's front they oft had brav'd “The stroke of fate on Palestine's blest coast, “Midst holy scenes too long by guilt deprav'd, “By blood acquir'd, and now by treasons lost, “Rous'd by their monarch's call compos'd his princely host. XLIII “To Asia's shores we bad a long farewell, “Heav'd the broad anchor, spread the flowing sail, “And felt the buoyant waves of ocean swell. “All nature seem'd our enterprise to hail: “Our barks, obedient to the fav'ring gale, “Cut the green billows as they curling play'd; “By night our course the moon with splendour pale “Illumin'd, while, in fiery pomp array'd, “The sun by day his orb from heav'n's high arch display'd. XLIV “Chearful and gay, across the wat'ry plain “In order due our tranquil course we held. “Far on our right, just rising from the main, “With outline faint the hills of Cyprus swell'd, “That isle renown'd, which Richard's power compell'd “For breach of faith his sway supreme to own, “It's rights restor'd, it's lawless tyrant quell'd. “Gazing we pass'd, as on it's summits brown “The setting sun spread wide a rich empurpled crown. XLV “Still breath'd th' inspiring gale, and soon the sky “Tinted with gold it's azure radiance wore: “In calm repose old ocean seem'd to lie, “As when the fabled deities of yore “O'er bounding waves their monarch's chariot bore, “And charm'd to peace the terrors of the deep. “Now, skirting by Scarpanti's craggy shore, “We view'd the Rhodian promontory steep, “Where amid roses sweet, envenom'd serpents creep. XLVI “With fragrance charg'd our sails the breezes fill'd, “While, slowly rising from th' horizon grey, “In cloudless majesty her ample shield “The moon with mild effulgence 'gan display. “As mounting high she held her awful way, “Ting'd with her silv'ry light on ev'ry side “Unnumber'd isles in rich confusion lay, “Half seen, and half obscur'd, extending wide, “While round their bases broke the gently murm'ring tide. XLVII “Fair dawn'd the day, when, op'ning to our view, “We saw the Cretan shores their length disclose. “Bright with the morning ray, and fresh with dew, “The lofty pinnacles of Ida rose, “As when, by love allur'd and soft repose, “Imperial Jove to it's recesses came. “And now the isle which wanton Venus chose, “Cythera green we saw, well known to fame “For myst'ries most impure and lust's unhallow'd flame. XLVIII “Tho' low in dust now lay her impious fane, “Tho' crouds no more her prostrate altars sought “With blushless front to urge their suit profane, “It seem'd as there some influence curs'd still wrought. “Thick vapours from the south collecting brought “Night premature, and gloom around us spread; “Still'd was the breeze; 'midst clouds with sulphur fraught “The sun declining glar'd with fiery red, “And tremulous shot his rays denouncing horrors dread. XLIX “No breath of wind disturb'd th' expanse serene, “Which still, as pass'd the clouds, appear'd t' assume “Strange tints of purple, black, or varying green, “Now streak'd with light, and now obscur'd in gloom, “As, from her deep unfathomable womb, “Sullen and slow the wild sea heaving roll'd. “Fancy, prophetic of approaching doom, “Sketch'd scenes of woe and terrors yet untold, “And o'er our hearts maintain'd dominion uncontroul'd. L “Soon was fulfill'd her presage. From the south “High mounting waves confess'd the furious blast, “And rear'd their foaming heads with force uncouth. “As on they roll'd, aloft their spray they cast, “While ocean, trembling thro' his caverns vast, “Re-echoing shook: from his profound domain “Th' affrighted tenants of the deep aghast “Uprear'd their writhing forms, and sought in vain “To shun the threaten'd ill, and fly impending pain. LI “For now, with horrors arm'd, the tempest came. “Darkness and clouds obscur'd the murky sky, “Save when, across the gloom, with livid flame “Quick-glancing light'nings shot their glare on high: “Mast'ring the water's roar, the seaman's cry, “In dreadful chorus thunders shook the air: “Borne on the whirlwind's wing, with haggard eye “Death led the storm; he shook his right arm bare, “And smil'd with joy malign to view his feast prepare. LII “Helpless awhile on ruin's work we gaz'd, “Our rudders lost, and torn each spreading sail; “On every deck the mariners uprais'd “Their trembling hands, high Heav'n with pray'r t' assail. “Shrouded in night's impenetrable veil, “They ask'd for light. To mock their hopeless woe, “A stream sulphureous gleam'd with lustre pale, “Gilding the terrors of the deep, to shew “The rocks which menac'd fate, the gulphs which yawn'd below. LIII “Still beat the rain, and still the tempest blew; “By force resistless urg'd, o'er billows vast “Lashing their shatter'd sides our vessels flew. “Now, from their eminence tremendous cast, “With rapid course precipitate we pass'd, “Lost in th' abysses of the wat'ry world: “Now, by new force impell'd, and mounting fast, “High in the air our straining barks were hurl'd, “Rode on the giant waves, and topp'd their summits curl'd. LIV “At length the day with welcome radiance beam'd. “Of all our fleet, where, but on yester's morn, “With comely pride two hundred pennants stream'd, “Not fifty barks were seen. These, with sails torn, “And shiver'd masts, on the wild waves were borne, “As will'd the storm which still unsated rag'd, “And seem'd our vain and feeble toils to scorn. “Fire, water, air, infernal warfare wag'd, “And fiends exulting howl'd, and woes unknown presag'd. LV “With glance impatient o'er the briny plain “We sought the ship which royal Richard bore. “Ye, who, when happiness ye look'd to gain, “When wide displaying all her richest store “Approaching bliss her smiles extatic wore, “Have seen the vision vanish into air, “And promis'd joy on faithless pinions soar, “Ye best can feel our woe, our mute despair, “When fruitless prov'd our search and vain our anxious care. LVI “Hopeless and sad 'mid rocks and shoals we drove: “Fortune still frown'd, and still our gallant band “Was doom'd the horrors of the sea to prove. “Where the Messenian capes their arms expand, “Driv'n on the rude inhospitable strand “Two luckless barks were wreck'd. Nor Osbert brave, “Nor Caunville, high in prowess and command, “Their well-earn'd fame or worth renown'd could save: “O'erwhelm'd they sank in death, and found a watery grave. LVII “Nor was to Clare a fate less harsh allow'd. “His shatter'd bark a mighty wave o'ertook “As the rude bosom of the deep it plough'd, “Swept it's wide deck, and all its timbers shook. “Nor courage cool nor dignity forsook “The falling hero: as with hope elate “To Heav'n he turn'd his last departing look, “He smil'd to meet inevitable fate, “Alike in war's dread front and in misfortunes great. LVIII “Vain were th' attempt each scene of woe to paint, “To speak the terrors which our hearts oppress'd. “Exhausted by excessive toil, and faint, “We view'd the setting sun. Far in the west “By murky clouds obscur'd he sank to rest, “Horrific emblem of our threaten'd doom! “With tears of agony we Heav'n address'd, “While, thro' the far-spread and increasing gloom, “Each foaming billow seem'd our inauspicious tomb. LIX “But milder prov'd th' omnipotent decree. “Severe in judgment, the almighty will “Poises the balance, and with just degree “The measure of his wrath apportions still. “The storm, which rag'd his purpose to fulfil, “Check'd by his power supreme, no longer blew: “Again, responsive to the pilot's skill, “O'er the smooth sea our shatter'd vessels flew; “Again reviving hope our panting bosoms knew. LX “From Heav'n's high arch in brilliancy array'd, “The starry host their chearing influence shed, “And gently o'er the face of ocean play'd; “While, mounting slowly from her tranquil bed, “The orb of night her placid lustre spread. “Exhausted nature seem'd to court repose. “Yet still, tormented by remembrance dread, “In every heart reflections sad arose “Of Richard seen no more, of suff'ring England's woes. LXI “The morning dawn'd, and light returning brought “To our enraptur'd view Corcyra's coast. “Within her hospitable port we sought “A safe asylum for our wearied host. “There, by the tempest's savage fury toss'd, “Four of our scatter'd Chiefs had refuge found: “Petterel and Fulk, their sails and rudder lost, “Saville, whose bark lay stranded on the ground, “And Essex, puissant Earl, in many a fight renown'd. LXII “We hail'd the lov'd companions of our toil, “And, while refitting our dismantled fleet, “We sought misfortune's pressure to beguile “With friendly intercourse and converse sweet. “Yet oft would mem'ry from her lonely seat “The perils dark of England's King recal; “Oft would our tongues his name rever'd repeat, “Oft from our eyes th' unbidden tear would fall, “And doubts and wild despair our tortur'd souls appal. LXIII “Ill can my voice, Oh Queen! my task perform, “Or speak the woes which fate had yet in store. “We learn'd that, driv'n by the remorseless storm, “The bark which royal Richard's standard bore “Lay wreck'd and shatter'd on Ragusa's shore. “Of him, escap'd from the o'erwhelming wave, “Fame vaguely spoke as wand'ring to explore “The regions water'd by th' impetuous Save, “And 'midst Dalmatia's rocks adversity to brave. LXIV “To learn his further fate we strove in vain. “Soon therefore as our never-ceasing toil “Our ships had fitted for the sea again, “And ocean seem'd on our attempt to smile, “Sad and oppress'd we left Corcyra's isle. “Fruitless it were my narrative to swell “With less momentous facts. On England's soil “Safely tho' late we landed, there to tell “With heart-felt grief, the chance which England's King befel.” LXV As Hubert thus pursued his hapless tale, Each tear-swoln eye it's influence seem'd to prove: Now flush'd the cheek, now apprehension pale The curdling blood to its recesses drove, As hope with fear, as grief with horror strove. By recollections sad and woe oppress'd Meek Berengaria mourn'd her absent love; While dauntless Elinor the pang suppress'd, And thus with voice assur'd th' attendant peers address'd. LXVI “Chieftains! at length the bitter cup is fill'd; “To drain its dregs the powers of Hell command. “No more her edifice of joy to build “Enliv'ning hope extends her fost'ring hand; “No more on high her mounting wings expand. “Oh cruel mandate of imperious fate! “When plague and famine desolate the land, “When foul rebellion shakes the tott'ring state, “Thus with augmented ills to crown immortal hate! LXVII “Oh Richard! to my longing eyes more dear “Than light, than life! for thee my grief must flow, “For thee must drop my unavailing tear. “Whether o'er mountains capt with endless snow “Thou bend'st thy toilsome march with footsteps slow, “Or 'mid barbaric tribes and wilds uncouth “O'er thee new horrors fate prepares to strew, “Oh hear our vows of constancy and truth! “Let these thy soul support, thy suff'ring spirit sooth! LXVIII “But thee nor toils nor adverse fate alarm: “Thy gallant heart, where constancy presides, “Which innate worth and gen'rous feelings warm, “Mocks at extrinsic chance and fear derides. “Tho' threat'ning oceans heave their boist'rous tides, “Tho' light'nings glare, and thunders round thee roll, “Protecting Heav'n my wand'ring hero guides, “Inspires new courage fortune to controul, “Braces each nerve, and stamps with energy his soul. LXIX “Let Richard's virtue then our bosoms fire. “Tho' Heav'n's mysterious will our hopes defeat, “Let us to equal fortitude aspire, “Like him sublime in woe, in misery great. “Think of the ills which now assembled meet; “Think of your plighted faith to England's King. “Let prompt resolve o'ertake occasion fleet: “While yet from wisdom happiness may spring, “By councils wise and firm to England comfort bring.” LXX As when November leads her wintry train, And stretches o'er the firmament her veil Charg'd with foul vapours, fogs and drizzly rain, Horror and mute despondency prevail; If then, as rises the propitious gale, The lamp of day dispel the noxious cloud, Hills, vales and groves his genial influence hail: So, when the Queen had ended, thro' the croud Reviving hope burst forth with acclamations loud. LXXI Meantime the Peers in close debate were seen: But soon their suffrage, sage and well matur'd, Leicester collecting, thus address'd the Queen. “To adverse chance and hardships long inur'd, “With fix'd resolve and constancy assur'd “We view the ills which menace England's throne, “Ills which by courage only can be cur'd. “But gen'rous minds in perils most are shewn; “Honour in danger's front by action best is known. LXXII “We feel that on ourselves our fate depends. “Tho' pestilence and famine hold their reign, “Tho' discord far her direful sway extends, “And bloody torrents England face distain, “Be our's the task allegiance to maintain. “Our lives, our treasures freely we bestow “Our country's peace and safety to regain; “Blest, if in death our parting spirits know “The transports undebas'd from loyalty which flow! LXXIII “To arm our vassals, and on every side “Our force to raise, we fly without delay. “What tho' with foul and over-weening pride “Our foreign foes their martial ranks display, “And home-bred traitors join their proud array, “Their force and arts we equally defy. “Inspiring Heav'n shall guide us on our way; “The guardian angel of our Isle on high “Fanning his fav'ring wings shall lead to victory. LXXIV “But, while your Barons thus such means prepare “As ardent zeal and loyalty suggest, “And rush the perils of the field to share, “To ease the public mind they deem it best “Forthwith with powers sufficient to invest “Some trusty messengers: Ere yet too late “Let them thro' Europe's bound pursue their quest, “Traverse with heedful scrutiny each state, “And ascertain with truth their suff'ring Monarch's fate.” LXXV “Sage are your councils,” Elinor rejoin'd; “But where shall we our heedful view direct “Such as the mission may fulfil to find?” Sudden, a youthful Knight of fair aspect, Whose vigorous form and countenance erect Bespoke his worth, before the croud advanc'd. To either Queen he bow'd with due respect: His native manliness a blush enhanc'd, As o'er th' assembled peers his speaking eye he glanc'd. LXXVI A snow-white plume his nodding casque adorn'd, While, o'er his temples and majestic brow, Luxuriant tresses which restriction scorn'd Wanton'd, and down his neck descended low. Blondel his name. The unbelieving foe Oft had his prowess felt in bloody field: For, tho' his heart with pity soft could glow, Yet, when the trumpet call'd, he well could wield The deeply biting sword, and poise the pond'rous shield. LXXVII Nor him alone did valour's trophies grace. The laws of verse by tuneful bards reported And music's powers he early learn'd to trace. On Loire's green banks he long the Muses courted, And there had often with the graces sported, When with light feet the jocund dance they led. Fondly with him the laughing train consorted, And, as they play'd around, from oozy bed The spirit of the stream enraptur'd rais'd his head. LXXVIII No sound the universal silence broke, But expectation beaming from each eye Check'd fond enquiry, as the youth thus spoke. “Fearless of perils, and prepar'd to die, “Be mine th' important enterprise to try. “Tho' young in arms, and little known to fame, “My country's cause will energy supply: “Inspir'd by zeal, at royal Richard's name “My loyal heart beats high, and owns the gen'rous flame. LXXIX “Stampt on my soul, and with my life combin'd, “Is the remembrance of my much-lov'd King; “And dear the hours which to my grateful mind “The splendid image of his virtues bring. “From this pure source of knightly prowess spring “All that of promise grac'd my rude essays. “Thus when the Eaglet tries his feeble wing, “Led by his princely sire, he learns to raise “Towards Heaven his ardent glance, and on the sun to gaze. LXXX “Near Saumur liv'd my ever honour'd sire, “In deeds of chivalry and arms grown old, “Tho' not extinguish'd his heroic fire. “An only son his eve of life consol'd. “Oft in his fond embrace would he infold “My youthful form, and oft of vanquish'd foes, “Of combats rude and puissant knights he told. “Still as he spoke, my mounting spirit rose, “Panted for high exploits, and spurn'd at soft repose. LXXXI “When thirteen summers o'er my head had pass'd, “And boyish pastimes ceas'd my mind t' engage, “O'er neighb'ring courts his eye my parent cast, “Where, 'midst examples bright and counsels sage, “Ere yet employ'd on life's tumultuous stage, “My early youth might wise instruction gain. “'Twas then, receiv'd as princely Richard's page, “At Poictiers, where he held his gracious reign, “With rev'rence meet I sought his favour to obtain. LXXXII “My humble duty his attention caught. “As o'er my artless and admiring soul “His gentle precepts, with endearments fraught, “And mild as passing Zephyrs, grateful stole, “I learn'd each boist'rous passion to controul. “My heart to GOD he taught me to direct, “Whose power almighty rules from pole to pole, “My King to honour, and with due respect “Woman, Heaven's loveliest work, to succour and protect. LXXXIII “Thus, bless'd by fortune, ignorant of ill, “And daily growing in my Prince's love, “I saw five years their circling courses fill. “Now, destin'd in a higher sphere to move, “To fill the throne and empire's cares to prove, “O'er England's realm my royal master reign'd. “Still fate with his my fortunes interwove: “With kind remembrance and regard unfeign'd “Me as his humble friend he graciously retain'd. LXXXIV “My grateful soul his high example fir'd: “On every word and every look I hung, “And felt my heart with ardour new inspir'd, “As with enchanting melody he sung, “Or from his harp the strain harmonious wrung. “Thus thro' the vine-sprig flows the parent juice, “Supports its weak stem and it's tendrils young, “'Till thro' it's mass revolving suns diffuse “The mystic powers which fruit and suckers re-produce. LXXXV “When to the Asian shores my Monarch led “His gallant force, his footsteps I pursued. “There, as aloft the holy banner spread, “Thro' unheard perils and encounters rude, “O'er fields with Saracenic blood imbued, “Blondel ne'er left his much-lov'd master's side. “Still, as the doubtful combat he renew'd, “As flow'd around the deep-empurpled tide, “Death on his faulchion perch'd spread desolation wide. LXXXVI “On Jaffa's plain, where the whole Pagan host “My dauntless King with his intrepid band “Drove pale and trembling from the sea-girt coast, “By him in danger's hour 'twas mine to stand, “Watchful o'er him my ample shield t' expand, “ And ward the blows which vengeful malice gave. “Heav'n knew my zeal, and guided well my hand, “Brac'd every nerve impending fate to brave, “And careless of myself my country's pride to save. LXXXVII “When victory grac'd my hero's sanguin'd crest, “And vanquish'd Saladin confess'd his fame, “His humble vassal to his heart he press'd. “Assume, cried he, a Knight's distinguish'd name! “Henceforth let honour's bright and hallow'd flame “Thy ardent soul to worth chivalric lead: “Pursue thy course without reproach or shame; “Whate'er thy lot—to triumph, or to bleed— “Where virtue points the way undauntedly proceed. LXXXVIII “Such are the ties that bind me to my King. “Oh gracious mistress! if the suff'rer's cry “To your mov'd soul could e'er compassion bring, “If pow'rful sorrow e'er could draw a sigh, “Listen, and with my humble suit comply. “Thus to all-ruling Heav'n my vow I make! “Far from my troubled couch shall pleasure fly, “Peace shall this breast, and rest these limbs forsake, “Till from our dark suspense shall certainty awake!” LXXXIX While thus with dignified tho' modest phrase The gallant youth his artless tale rehears'd, In accents loud th' assembly spoke his praise: But when in foreign climes to dare the worst He vow'd, a gen'ral acclamation burst Of mingled joy and apprehension dread. Imperial Elinor, in thought immers'd, The impulse strong partaking rais'd her head, And, as she own'd his worth, thus to Blondel she said. XC “If innate virtue can success insure, “If lively gratitude and feelings high “Can arm the soul with zeal and courage pure “Dangers to meet and perils to defy, “On thee, Sir Knight! our warmest hopes rely. “Thy boon is granted. O'er thy devious way “May Heav'n's great ruler look with fav'ring eye! “May his propitious aid thy toils allay, “Nor cease on thy behalf his mercies to display! XCI “This scarf, embroider'd by my hands, accept: “Be it, whate'er betide of ill or good, “Of my regard as a memorial kept. “While on the banks of Danube's princely flood, “Or o'er Germania, or Hungaria rude, “As wand'ring far and spent with care you rove, “By this with lasting constancy endued, “O'ercome the ills which fate ordains to prove “For me, for England's cause, and royal Richard's love. XCII “Meantime, while earnest on your great intent “For enterprise and travel you prepare, “Let us, t' emplore Heav'n's grace and kind assent, “Forthwith to holy Peter's fane repair. “While there we prostrate breathe our fervent prayer, “While round us censers clouds of incense fling, “And pealing anthems rend the sacred air, “From realms of bliss their way shall Seraphs wing, “To crown our ardent hopes, and save our honour'd King!” XCIII She spake, and straightway tow'rds the sacred pile With dignified composure led the way; While brave Blondel, intent upon his toil, Repair'd to Greenwich, where in long array The royal armament at anchor lay. A ready bark he chose: forthwith the crew, Eager his welcome mandate to obey, And nothing loth their labours to renew, To aid his bold design from every quarter flew. END OF BOOK II. BOOK III. ARGUMENT. Expedition of Blondel in search of Richard. I Fair was the wind, and smooth the sea which bore, On high intent engag'd, from Albion's strand, The gen'rous Chieftain to the Belgic shore. While from the top-mast's height with practis'd hand The seamen wrought their flutt'ring sails t' expand, Thro' the clear waves they saw their vessel glide; And as, by Zephyr's gentlest breezes fann'd, The curling waters lav'd each swelling side, High stream'd it's pennant gay with richest crimson dy'd. II From the broad surface of the wat'ry plain The silv'ry moon now sought her solemn height, While, far as eye could stretch, a num'rous train Of stars and planets shed their glitt'ring light, In varied rank and rich confusion bright. As their effulgence o'er the ocean stole, Tinging the green waves with celestial white, Their influence mild sooth'd his afflicted soul; He own'd the power divine, who form'd and rules the whole. III Now shone the summits of the waves with gold, And from the wide horizon stretch'd a ray Of purest light, which spread, as 'gan unfold His ample shield the glorious orb of day. The sea-fowls gamboll'd in fantastic play, As thro' the Scheld's half-cover'd shoals they steer'd: Safely the vessel cut it's winding way, And soon their longing sight the harbour cheer'd, Where her rich-sculptur'd fanes illustrious Antwerp rear'd. IV On the broad quay, where throng'd the busy croud Of those whom enterprise or commerce brought To view of Europe's trade th' emporium proud, Blondel prepar'd to land. He heeded nought Fortune's rich stores which those around him sought, But, by warm zeal and pure affection led, His humble scrip and staff of palmer caught, In pilgrim's guise Germania's bounds to tread, Heedless alike of toils and of encounters dread. V Nor Moselle's stream impeded his career, Nor Rhine deep-sounding from his bed profound, Nor Meyne, where Frankfort's walls her waters cheer, In future times with trade and freedom crown'd. Still unappall'd his lengthen'd march he wound, Resolv'd each danger and fatigue to brave, Thro' rich Franconia and Bavaria's round, 'Till, reaching Austria's state, he stoop'd to lave His limbs by toils unnerv'd in proud Danubia's wave. VI But him no soft delights could now delay, Nor nature's beauties, nor the busy throng Of peopled cities might his footsteps stay, Or from his purpos'd course detain him long. Deep in his soul remain'd his Sov'reign's wrong: And still, as musing on his fortunes rude, He felt his zeal reviv'd, his hope more strong, O'er hill, o'er dale, his journey he pursued, 'Till now, approaching near, Vienna's towers he view'd. VII 'Tho' in his lowly palmer's weeds array'd He deem'd himself from open wrong secure, Yet well he knew that Austria's Duke display'd A mind with malice and revenge impure, Which haply ill might his abode assure Within the city's walls. He judg'd it best In the more humble suburb to procure The means of food and necessary rest, And there unnotic'd urge the purpose of his quest. VIII Beneath a straw clad roof, in decent cot, A sire of rev'rend mien there chanc'd to dwell: Content he seem'd with his sequester'd lot, While the grey locks that on his shoulders fell Bespoke a length of years, instructed well Of past events and councils wise to speak. Ne'er from his door the poor did he repel; But, when he saw them desolate and weak, He bad them turn to him, and rest and refuge seek. IX When tow'rds his humble gate the wand'rer drew, Him in respectful terms the vet'ran greets; And, as now 'gan to fall the ev'ning dew, His friendly invitation oft repeats. “I boast,” cried he, “no nectar'd juice, nor meats “Of flavour high to tempt the pamper'd taste: “Far from my board be such unseemly treats, “Where nought but nature's requisites are plac'd! “Rich I esteem the feast by kindly welcome grac'd.” X Nor turn'd the Pilgrim from his words aside. With busy hand the sire his table spread; His simple fare he cheerfully supplied, Fresh milk, ripe fruits, and nuts, and wheaten bread. O'er all his hospitable kindness shed More grace and true delight, than those oft know In splendid courts and pomp luxurious bred. The well-heap'd hearth dispens'd it's cheerful glow, And soon the ready thought in converse free 'gan flow. XI They talk'd of Austria's state; and much the host Of Leopold's despotic sway complain'd, Who, since he homeward led from Judah's coast His warlike bands, with cruelties had stain'd The fair repute his former deeds had gain'd. He told how oft his subjects he oppress'd, And how brave stranger knights he oft retain'd In durance base and tyrannous arrest, Who lay in shameful bonds, neglected and distress'd. XII “Ah!” cried Blondel, “amid the mournful band “Of captive knights, perhaps the well-known name “Of England's warlike King enroll'd may stand. “In Palestine he gain'd immortal fame; “Returning thence, so rumour speaks, he came “With few attendants to Dalmatia's shore. “No tidings since his destiny proclaim: “Uncertain if the fates will e'er restore “The gallant Prince, his realms their cruel loss deplore.” XIII “From foreign climes and Judah's distant plain “Doubtless,” replied the host, “you lately come, “Else had you known that Henry's tow'rs detain “The English Richard. Him the furies doom “To sigh unheard in some dark dungeon's gloom, “Sold by our Austrian Duke: with vengeful mind, “For insult offer'd to his flag and plume, “Him, on his coast when wreck'd, he first confin'd, “And then for sordid gold to Henry's pow'r consign'd.” XIV His accents pierc'd Blondel's afflicted soul; His cheek grew pale, and tears distain'd his eye: Yet prudence taught his feelings to controul, To hide his grief, and check the rising sigh. With voice subdued he ventur'd to reply, “Since then the hapless Prince's fate you know, “Perchance where now in chains he is doom'd to lie, “Consuming life and hope in countless woe, “From friendly commerce hid, you may vouchsafe to shew.” XV He said. Tho' ill his tongue perform'd the task, His aged host remark'd not his distress. “Pilgrim!” said he, “full gladly what you ask “Would I resolve; but such was the address “Of those who hence convey'd him, that to guess “Where now confin'd he lies exceeds my pow'r. “Those who do wrong will scarce their wrong confess. “Yet well I deem he wastes his lonely hour “Near Henry's princely seat, in some well-guarded tow'r.” XVI No more of Richard's fate the sire could tell: Yet still his tongue, more garrulous from age, On what his heart most felt was pleas'd to dwell. He sought his guest in converse to engage Of Judah's land, where, daring Pagan rage, Crusaders bold the dubious fight maintain'd. But converse now avail'd not to assuage The pilgrim's mind by grief and terror pain'd; Tho' these he strove to hide, and still attention feign'd. XVII Now mounted high the ebon car of night, The watch-dog bay'd the moon, and owls obscene, From church-yard's gloom, or ivied turret's height, With horrid concert hail'd their mystic queen. And now, repos'd on couches low and mean, The friendly pair address'd themselves to sleep. But ah! what opiate could the anguish keen Which tore Blondel's sad heart in slumber keep? To sigh his sole relief, his best delight to weep! XVIII Before the lark her early hymn had sung, Or morn returning ting'd the east with grey, From his unhonour'd couch he nimbly sprung. In vain his host implor'd him yet to stay, And urg'd the toils and perils of his way: The oft-inforc'd request Blondel denied. His thanks return'd, in palmer's meek array Tow'rd Worms he now resolv'd his steps to guide, Unaw'd by all the ills which might his course betide. XIX And now for many a mile again he trod The paths which late his wearied feet had worn; Where her wide bosom proud Bavaria shew'd, Where o'er Franconia, rich in vines and corn, Her treasures Autumn pour'd from copious horn. From him her gifts could no attention claim: He journey'd on, by pain and labour torn, 'Till to th' embattled walls of Worms he came, Where Henry's rule was felt and sanguinary fame. XX It now behov'd him with redoubled care Sagely his close enquiries to direct: For here he knew imprudence might ensnare, And minions base, who crouded courts infect, The object of his mission might collect, And to the tyrant's ear the tale convey. He first resolv'd the prisons to inspect, If haply there, depriv'd of air and day, His lov'd and injur'd King in cruel durance lay. XXI In vain he went his melancholy round; In vain each scene of wretchedness he view'd, Where vice it's merited correction found, Where wild improvidence it's folly rued, Or innocence oppress'd for mercy sued. Fruitless was still his toil; no lonely cell Reveal'd the object of his search renew'd, Nor did he dare his views at large to tell, Or risk to ask what might his anxious doubts dispel. XXII Yet all his cares were not employ'd in vain: He learn'd, in many a castle's dreary keep, Ling'ring for years in wretchedness and pain, Unnumber'd captives were condemn'd to weep; Some rack'd with tortures sharp in dungeons deep, 'Till death reliev'd their woe; some left alone In ever-during solitude to steep Their pittance coarse in tears, there still to moan, And in close darkness pent in agony to groan. XXIII Much did Blondel their piteous lot deplore; For much his heart for human misery griev'd: But scenes like these incited him the more To learn his Monarch's fortunes. He believ'd Past labours vain while ought was unatchiev'd. Long time his search he made with fruitless care: At length, a rugged Castle he perceiv'd, Which, on a spreading plain remote and bare, Stretch'd it's forbidding front, and proudly mock'd the air. XXIV Where heav'd a mount above th' adjacent waste The fortress stood. Well squar'd, each equal side Tow'rds one of Heav'n's great points was justly trac'd, Fenc'd by a turret huge, whose losty pride Inclement skies and time's attack defied. Where spread the eastern front, with sculpture crown'd And emblems rude of war, the portal wide Disclos'd it's deep recess; while all around Beyond the yawning moat the sturdy rampart frown'd. XXV In dreadful majesty the fabric rose: Round it a dreary heath, where never smil'd The yellow harvest, stretch'd but to disclose Sterility unbounded, rocks high pil'd, And famine's gaunt dominion bleak and wild: Save, in the western quarter, where a wood, Whose solemn shades the wearied eye beguil'd, In state antique and awful stillness stood, And rear'd aloft it's head, and wav'd o'er many a rood. XXVI When to the solemn pile Blondel drew nigh He anxiously survey'd the scene so dread, Where 'mid the ivied walls and turrets high, Birds of ill-omen'd note their dull wings spread, And o'er the mass fantastic horrors shed. Slowly, and lost in visionary trance, The sod he travers'd with uncertain tread, When 'cross the distant plain he cast his glance, And saw in peasant garb a lowly hind advance. XXVII A shepherd swain he seem'd of humble mien, His front was wrinkled, hoar his locks from age, Grave his demeanour, and his air serene; Courteous he was, by long experience sage, And not unread in legendary page, Tho' doom'd for stipend small a flock to tend: Yet still did higher themes his mind engage; Oft would his knee in supplication bend, While to just Heav'n his thoughts would fervently ascend. XXVIII Him with becoming phrase Blondel address'd. Some hope he had his converse might dispel The settled anguish of his tortur'd breast; For he conceiv'd that near the swain might dwell, And thence concluded that he knew right well All the proud pile's traditionary fame. Earnest to learn whatever there befel, He urg'd him to disclose the Castle's name, And what else worthy note to his remembrance came. XXIX “Good Pilgrim,” he replied, “you seek to know “What still untold might better far remain: “For who delights to hang on tales of woe, “Or glut the ear with narratives of pain? “The dread Trivallis' cursed walls contain “No vaulted hall, no dungeon damp or drear, “No chamber close, which murders do not stain. “Full oft, 'tis said, the injur'd ghosts appear, “Their shadowy forms display, their fronts ensanguin'd rear. XXX “Oft at the midnight hour, the guard reports, “Strange sounds are heard, when as the ghastly band “With dismal lamentation fills the courts. “Now, on the turret's top is seen to stand “Some warrior's troubled spirit; in his hand “Aloft he seems to wave his faulchion dire, “And menace judgments on the guilty land: “Now flitting shades, whose eye-balls gleam with fire, “Skirt the polluted halls, and form a fearful choir. XXXI “Nor these reports do I unfounded hold. “Oft has my father, whose observing eye “Well noted what occurr'd, the story told. “Oft have I heard him say, that, passing nigh, “He saw the visionary phantoms fly, “Skim thro' the troubled air, and pierce the gloom: “And oft his list'ning ear had heard their cry, “As with sad voice they mourn'd their piteous doom, “Their suff'rings still prolong'd, their yet neglected tomb. XXXII “I too have heard the strange terrific sound: “Oft cross my path obscure has glanc'd the shade, “When silence held the hour, and when around “The circling bat it's midnight gambols play'd. “Three nights ago, as here by chance I stray'd, “Strange notes I heard from yonder western tow'r. “Ne'er from my mem'ry will their cadence fade! “His wild complaint some spirit seem'd to show'r “Of vengeance unappeas'd and too successful pow'r. XXXIII “Shepherd! if yet you can the words retain “Which strongly thus your passing ear assail'd, “Recount them,” cried Blondel. “I heard them plain,” Replied the swain, “nor has th' impression fail'd: “Yet came they to my wond'ring senses veil'd “In idiom strange and foreign, such as ne'er “Germanic tongue in speech or song detail'd; “Cloath'd in such dulcet sounds, as angels fair “Chant to the raptur'd spheres when souls to Heav'n they bear.” XXXIV Awhile the shepherd paus'd, and pensive stood As one in contemplation deep engross'd; Nor was Blondel less fix'd in thoughtful mood: His busy mind by anxious doubts was toss'd; Now hopes, now fears, his varying fancy cross'd. But soon the swain his sad account resum'd. “Forgive,” said he, “if, in reflection lost, “I ceas'd to tell what captives there were doom'd “To ling'ring woe, or those who there remain entomb'd. XXXV “Six hundred years have now their close attain'd, “Since over Orleans' and Austrasia's bound “With potent sway King Childebertus reigned. “'Twas he who first decreed these tow'rs to found, “And 'gainst his pow'rful foes to circle round “The solid fortress with a rampart vast, “Which o'er the moat in sullen grandeur frown'd: “Here, in imperial pomp, his days he pass'd, “And here, tradition tells, the Monarch breath'd his last. XXXVI “Two sons he left. To Thierry, his first care, “He gave to rule wide Orleans' fertile state; “And next decreed that all Austrasia fair “Should on Theodobert, his second, wait. “Vain were it here the causes to narrate “Which 'twixt the brethren cruel war inspir'd, “Or how the bloody Brunehault their hate “Urg'd on, and still their savage fury fir'd, “'Till by foul treason struck, Theodobert expir'd. XXXVII “Stern Thierry's arms Austrasia's realm subdued, “And soon, by cruel Brunehault convey'd, “His brother's head on yonder walls he view'd, “Which to the sun it's gory front display'd. “Nor by her grandson's death was yet allay'd “Her sanguinary fury: here she brought “His two young sons to her fell gripe betray'd; “And, while from her they fond protection sought, “With murd'rous hand their base and foul destruction wrought. XXXVIII “But tho' high Heav'n, provok'd by mortal guilt, “To strike th' offender may awhile forbear, “Yet soon or late, for kindred's blood thus spilt, “Eternal justice will the bolt prepare. “Fierce Thierry thus, when slain his nephews fair, “Nor pity feeling nor acute remorse, “As from yon turret with observant care “He view'd the movements of his conq'ring force, “By light'ning struck he fell a black and ghastly corse. XXXIX “Four infant sons he had. To bold Garnier “These were committed now in holy trust “That he their youth with counsel sage should rear. “But, vilely tempted by ambition's lust, “Soon to his sov'reign's sons he prov'd unjust. “Their princely hopes to quick destruction doom'd, “Like flow'rs which fade and mingle with the dust, “By baleful poison's pow'rful juice consum'd “They sank in death, and there still lie the babes entomb'd. XL “Austrasia's rulers now the castle left, “Polluted thus with death and stain'd with blood. “Yet, tho' of state and regal pomp bereft, “It still accurs'd and terrifying stood: “It's lofty ramparts which access preclude, “It's moated strength, and battlements so high, “The heath around so desolate and rude, “Mark'd it a place where pris'ners sad might lie, “Unknown, unnotic'd, there to languish and to die. XLI “And there, for ages past, have pin'd in woe, “By cordial pity and Heav'n's light unbless'd, “Unnumber'd captives. None their fate might know, “How long they liv'd, or when to gentle rest “Their spirits sank, by torments harsh oppress'd. “'Tis said, that arts infernal have supplied, “Where stretch the castle's ramparts to the west, “Beneath each dungeon caverns deep and wide, “Whose dark abyss from view each mangled corse may hide.” XLII “And now within the castle's foul recess “What captives lie?” Blondel impatient said. “Pilgrim,” replied the swain, “'tis hard to guess “What pris'ners now contain these chambers dread. “Mysterious silence is around them spread. “Yet saw I lately, not five months are pass'd, “A gallant captive there in secret led, “What time the early moon descended fast, “And o'er the murky sky pale night her mantle cast.” XLIII “And did you note him well?” Blondel exclaim'd. “Ill thro' the gloom could I his features trace,” Return'd the swain; “but yet his look proclaim'd “Some warrior sprung from no ignoble race. “As the faint moon-beam play'd upon his face, “He shew'd a front which danger oft had brav'd: “With manly frown he ey'd his keepers base, “And, as they urg'd him on with zeal deprav'd, “He strode, while loose in air his auburn tresses wav'd.” XLIV As when by heaving billows rudely toss'd, Far from its course rough storms a vessel drive, It's sails all shatter'd, and it's compass lost, In vain the mariners desponding strive: Fresh clouds their hearts of every hope deprive. Should then the moon her splendid orb expand, And to their fainting souls her succour give, They view with genuine extacy the land, And hail the welcome port which shews relief at hand. XLV Such was the ray, which o'er Blondel's sad mind Flash'd rapidly. Reliev'd from anxious pain, His breast no more with grief unceasing pin'd: Richard might yet survive, and once again Restor'd to England's throne in splendour reign. But soon reflection check'd his fond delight; Tho' hope was giv'n, yet fears would still remain: Much it behov'd him to reflect aright, Lest disappointment harsh his new-born joy should blight. XLVI Fix'd to the spot as deep entranc'd he stood, The rampart high he long'd t' approach more near, If haply from the turret's summit rude, He might the pris'ner's sad complainings hear Which lately struck the wond'ring peasant's ear. But soon arous'd, as issuing from the gate The bridge they cross'd, he saw a troop appear, Which on the heath, dispos'd in warlike state, Their lengthen'd line drew up their Chief's approach to wait. XLVII Fearful that if thus gazing he should stand Suspicions of his purpose might arise, His way tow'rd Worms again to turn he plann'd, And there unnotic'd frame some apt disguise To lull the guard and cheat their watchful eyes. Slow as he trac'd his melancholy way, His busy thoughts expedients would devise, To know if there his captive Monarch lay, And how he might avoid his project to betray. XLVIII At length he fix'd a minstrel's garb to wear, Whose sanction'd freedom might his views conceal; With locks close shorn a merry harp to bear, And thus apparell'd with the guard to deal, To charm their caution and their secret steal. High did he estimate the pow'rs of song; Oft had he known the rugged bosom feel, And oft to pity change th' intended wrong, By harmony subdued and music's 'witching tongue. XLIX At Worms arriv'd, without delay he sought All that became a minstrel to provide; A well-strung harp, with seemly carving wrought, A robe of green, whose sleeves hung large and wide, A doublet trim of russet colour dyed, A ruff fair starch'd, and chain which silver shew'd, A girdle red, and dagger for his side: All these with fitting diligence he stow'd, And left the town ere yet the ruddy ev'ning glow'd. L To the wide forest, which beyond the plain Spread far it's deep and venerable shade, He came, as first upon the wat'ry main The sun's departing splendour 'gan to fade. The distant hills, with purplish tints array'd, Skirted with grace sublime th' horizon bold, While on the scatter'd clouds the sunbeams play'd: As by degrees their varying forms unroll'd, They shone with silver bright, or blaz'd with dazzling gold LI Far in the dark recesses of the wood, Where tow'ring oaks, high waving to the wind, The moss-grown tenants of the forest stood, A narrow path it's devious course inclin'd: To a sequester'd glade it led, where join'd The mantling boughs to form a calm retreat, With eglantine and ivy green entwin'd; Fit for some hermit's solitary seat, There on man's state to muse, on pleasures vain and fleet. LII Here from the busy haunts of men retir'd, And safely shrouded from each curious eye, Himself in minstrel's garb Blondel attir'd. Now faded slow the splendour of the sky; Across the twilight's shade the bat 'gan fly, And owls with heavy wing pursued their prey; The nightingale her lonely song rais'd high, And hail'd th' approaching gloom with plaintive lay, While yet the waning moon withheld her pow'rful ray. LIII As the extended heath he slowly cross'd And to the castle's solemn towers drew near, Their high embattlements in night half lost More dreadful rose, and seem'd more rude and drear. Now hope his anxious bosom fill'd, now fear; And, while he view'd the walls which might contain His King belov'd, he sigh'd, he dropt a tear, Uncertain whether all his toils were vain, Or if by stratagem admission he might gain. LIV In awful stillness now was nature bound, And night obscure her gloomy influence cast, Save when, as going their accustom'd round, The guard along the spreading rampart pass'd. As they advanc'd with steps confus'd and fast, Their gliding torches faintly glimm'ring play'd On the wide battlements and turrets vast, Forming huge masses of contrasted shade, Whose uncouth forms more drear the pile terrific made. LV The barren heath Blondel full sadly pac'd, And still, as musing on his Monarch's fate The fond remembrance of past joys he trac'd, On present woe his fancy would dilate. When sudden, rudely issuing from the gate, Loud bursts of boist'rous mirth and laughter came, Such, as when Bacchus' sons their orgies late Pursuing seek their madd'ning blood t' enflame, They shout with zeal impure and riotous acclaim. LVI Now ceas'd the sound, and silence wide prevail'd: But soon again, disturbing the still air, Fresh shouts of merriment his ear assail'd, As if, amid these haunts of fell despair, They sought their fears to chase and vanquish care. Now, mid the din, in notes profound and strong Some festive strain the passing gale would bear; And still, as clos'd the cadence of the song, Tumultuous voices join'd the chorus to prolong. LVII Blondel with transport heard the cheering sound, And hail'd the hour with hopes propitious fraught. When still'd again the clam'rous joy he found, His pendant harp with ready hand he caught, And strains so vig'rous and so loud he wrought, As made the rampart's wide recesses ring; Yet sweet as those, surpassing human thought, Which Zephyr bears upon his fervid wing, When with soft touch he wakes the wild Æolian string. LVIII Still did his hand th' enchanting strain provoke: Nor vain his toil; soon from the rampart's height With gratulation kind a warrior spoke. “Thou, who amid the horrors of the night, “Canst with thy sounds divine the soul delight, “Say who thou art, and whence? with earnest pray'r “Thee to their social board my friends invite. “Approach then, Minstrel! to our hall repair, “Partake our flowing bowl, our banquet freely share.” LIX “A Minstrel Squire am I,” Blondel rejoin'd, “Who from fair France have bent my toilsome way “In Henry's court a station meet to find. “In travel sore I spent the tedious day, “'Till, at the turn of noon, I chanc'd to stray “To yonder wood; there, in it's cool retreat, “Shrouded in balmy sleep too long I lay; “Since when, across the heath with wearied feet, “Wand'ring, in vain I've sought some friendly roof to meet. LX “Gladly, kind Sir! your proffer'd boon I take; “Gladly I hail your hospitable wall: “Some little sojourn if allow'd to make, “Repose and food my vigour may recal.” He said; and soon the drawbridge 'gan to fall; The warrior hasten'd forth his steps to meet, And straitway led him to the vaulted hall, Where numbers stood the minstrel feign'd to greet: Nor staid they at the board their welcome guest to seat. LXI Their banquet no high-season'd meats adorn'd, No piquant cates to tempt the languid taste; Such luxuries the rugged soldier scorn'd. Here on the rude but ample board was plac'd Nutritious food, by mixtures undebas'd: Nor did the crew the copious treat disdain. When ended was the feast, they sought in haste To try what might the well-fill'd bowl contain, And emulously strove the sparkling juice to drain. LXII While cautiously Blondel preferr'd to quaff, The ample goblet oft their thirst allay'd, And, as they drank, with loud triumphant laugh Their prowess Bacchanalian they display'd. With common voice they now the Minstrel pray'd To grace with music's gay delight their cheer. Blondel with ready courtesy obey'd, And thus commenc'd his song; while, crouding near, Each list'ning warrior press'd his harmony to hear. LXIII “When valiant knights and courtly dames delight “In feasts and revelry to pass the hour, “Then welcome is the jolly Minstrel's sight, “Who glads with melody the vaulted tow'r, “Or charms with strains divine the festive bow'r. “Whether of love and am'rous deeds he sings, “Or of injurious force and vengeful pow'r “From antient chronicles example brings, “Ne'er sounds his voice in vain, ne'er fail his pow'rful strings. LXIV “O'er hill and valley wand'ring far and wide, “Unaw'd by toils, by perils unsubdued, “Well is the patient Minstrel's spirit tried. “But little heeds he such encounters rude: “With courage high and constancy endued, “His task perform'd, the ready harp he takes, “And, while the pleasing subject is pursued, “Extatic rounds of harmony he makes, “Unlocks the pow'rs of song, and all the soul awakes. LXV “Now sings he of the damsel fair and chaste, “Whose sire severe condemns her constant love, “Compell'd in savage wilds her days to waste, “'Thro' trackless woods and forests wide to rove, “Protected only by the Pow'rs above. “Oft does the giant foe her fears alarm; “Oft is she doom'd th' enchanter's wiles to prove: “Yet, still secur'd from each impending harm, “She lives to bless the youth whose heart her beauties charm. LXVI “Now louder strains the varying song requires. “Of arms he sings, and of the gallant knight “Whose fearless bosom warlike fame inspires. “By glory warm'd, array'd in armour bright, “Foul wrong to quell and worth oppress'd to right, “Dauntless he issues to the tented field: “There against hostile bands he proves his might, “Well skill'd his spear to couch, his sword to wield, “While routed squadrons fly and to his prowess yield. LXVII “When conquest waves her crimson'd wings on high, “No pangs of jealousy his triumph cloud. “Hark! how around is heard the joyful cry! “See! as he onward moves, th' exulting croud “Unite in praise and acclamation loud! “His empire bravely gain'd he hastes to share “With her to whom his constancy was vow'd: “Long bless'd with mutual love their crowns they wear, “For valour fam'd the Prince, for matchless grace the Fair.” LXVIII As hung the list'ning warriors on his song He saw the varying passions as they rose, And mark'd in every face th' emotion strong. Sudden a melancholy theme he chose; And, as he sung the fallen hero's woes, The sympathetic chords he softly press'd. Still, at each mournful modulation's close, Th' impression sad pervaded every breast, Each moisten'd eye the power of melody confess'd. LXIX “Behold!” he cried, “low on th' ensanguin'd plain, “Far from his host, the wounded chieftain lie! “No pitying hand is found to sooth his pain, “No friendly aid to cheer his drooping eye. “Mark, where the hostile band approaching nigh “To some lone tow'r their bleeding victim bear; “There, of all joy bereft, alone to sigh, “Alone to drop the unavailing tear, “Alone his captive hands tow'rds Heav'n in vain to rear. LXX “See where he wastes the tedious hours of woe, “Night's darkest horrors round his dungeon spread: “Sullen and deep the angry tempests blow, “And o'er his soul increasing sorrows shed. “Ye, to whose care devolves the duty dread “At morn and eve his pittance scant to deal, “When tow'rds his melancholy cell ye tread, “Say, o'er your minds does no compassion steal, “Do not your generous hearts a warrior's suff'rings feel? LXXI “Cease, Minstrel! cease,” exclaim'd a panting Chief, “No more on themes like this thy strain prolong. “Too well, alas! we know the captive's grief; “Nor need we all the magic of thy tongue “To paint his hapless fate in colours strong. “Here, 'midst this castle's solitary walls, “Oft does the lonely pris'ner moan his wrong; “Here, while surrounding gloom his sense appals, “With languid voice for death he oft unpitied calls. LXXII “Ev'n now, while thus we pass the festive hour, “Know that beneath this roof in bonds is held “A gallant captive. To his dreary tow'r “Frequent I mount, by feelings warm impell'd. “A man more dignified I've not beheld. “Ne'er from his lips is heard complaint to flow: “His soul undaunted, by duress unquell'd, “Beneath misfortune's yoke disdains to bow; “Still beam with fire his eyes, still frowns his martial brow.” LXXIII “Alas!” exclaim'd Blondel, “what pow'r severe “Condemns him thus to solitude and pain? “Who can refuse to woe like his a tear, “Or who his earnest wishes can restrain “Some further knowledge of his fate to gain?” “Perhaps too much already have I told,” The Warrior said; “to ask for more refrain. “While here our delegated trust we hold, “The secrets of our charge 'twere treason to unfold.” LXXIV “No secrets of your charge I seek to know,” Blondel replied: “yet wherefore thus conceal “The fate of him, who in redeemless woe “Marks with his sighs the moments as they steal?” “He who shall dare the myst'ry to reveal,” Exclaim'd a rugged Chieftain, “from my hand “Shall soon th' effect of his imprudence feel! “Minstrel! forbear to press thy rash demand: “Vainly you question those who form my trusty band.” LXXV Thus frowning spake the Chief. The list'ning throng, Aw'd by his word, confirm'd his stern behest. But soon Blondel renew'd his lively song, And, as again his harp's full chords he press'd, Essay'd the rising tumult to arrest. Of Arthur's court he sang and table round, Where valiant knights and many a noble guest Illustrious dames with rosy chaplets crown'd, While Merlin's potent wand the fiends in durance bound. LXXVI Much did the martial band the song approve: But ill the voice of melody avail'd From the rough Chieftain's bosom to remove The strong suspicion which his soul assail'd. He fear'd, he knew not why, some purpose veil'd Which might the Minstrel to the tow'r have brought; And, as his working mind the doubt detail'd, Of dangers dark and stratagems he thought, Of deeply laid designs, and plots with peril fraught. LXXVII Soon with address abrupt he sternly said: “Minstrel! tho' much thy song delights mine ear, “Yet must not my observance be betray'd “By pleasure to forget my trust severe. “Pleasure, tho' sweet, may yet be bought too dear. “Tho' ill th' injunction may your strains requite, “Yet hence perforce your footsteps you must bear. “The moon now mounting high dispenses light, “And with unclouded rays dispels the gloom of night.” LXXVIII He spake. As round his fiery eyes he cast, The warriors bow'd. Too well Blondel perceiv'd The apt occasion of his search was past. As when a husbandman, his hope deceiv'd, Surveys his field of it's rich crop bereav'd, While tempests rage and torrents sweep the ground, So for his thwarted enterprise he griev'd, So did the Chieftain's voice his sense astound, While from th' obedient crew it quick concurrence found. LXXIX “If stern necessity forbid my stay, “I bow,” replied he, “to the high behest. “Yet, from the Castle ere I take my way, “Receive the thankful homage of your guest “For hospitality and needful rest. “Warriors, farewell! tow'rd Worms my steps I bend. “Howe'er by labour and fatigue oppress'd, “My midnight travel Heav'n will sure defend, “And o'er my darkling path it's sacred shield extend.” LXXX The hall he quitted, and the drawbridge pass'd. Still ruminating on his Prince's doom, He sought the forest. As his eye he cast Along the outline of th' expanded gloom, Each tenant of the wood appear'd t' assume Some form fantastic, as the midnight glare With flitting touch it's branches chanc'd t' illume: Some ghastly warrior's mien it now would wear, Now like some monster gape, or like some Gorgon stare. LXXXI When a quick-passing cloud it's dark veil spread, All seem'd to vanish in the general shade; But, whenso'er the moon her radiance shed, Ideal phantoms were again pourtray'd In shapes more strange and horrible array'd, As if, in Synod there to meet compell'd, Malicious fiends their noxious gambols play'd, Shrouded from day and by the sun unquell'd; For ne'er his purer beams such visions dire beheld. LXXXII Thus when on midnight couch some fev'rish wretch Is doom'd a strong delirium to sustain, Distemper'd dreams their fancied horrors stretch, And whirl their madd'ning influence o'er his brain: While the black blood impell'd thro' ev'ry vein, Charg'd with contagion, loads his heaving heart, His suff'ring spirit labours with the pain, 'Cross his strain'd eye-balls fiery spectres dart, He raves and tears his flesh with wild convulsive start. LXXXIII Blondel these strange appearances admir'd, Which weaker bosoms might have chill'd with dread; But he, whose soul superior courage fir'd, Smil'd on the terrors which around him spread, And onward walk'd with firm determin'd tread To gain the path which wound within the wood. Yet, ere he left the plain, he turn'd his head, Again to view the Castle as it stood, Sublime in barbarous pride, polluted still with blood. LXXXIV On it's high walls he gaz'd and moat profound, Which now more vast and more tremendous shew'd In gloom obscure and night's dark mantle bound, Thro' which in vain their windings he pursued. But soon, from clouds releas'd, the moon renew'd Her fav'ring light, and, on the western tow'r Shedding her beams, disclos'd it's summit rude. More dread it frown'd than at the noon-tide hour, And with redoubled awe it's turrets seem'd to lour. LXXXV “And what if Richard there may lie,” he said: “What if the tale which struck my pitying ear “The cruel miseries of my King convey'd? “Be Heav'n my guide! away each idle fear! “Welcome each horror of yon Castle drear! “To dare it's perils thus I fondly fly!” Then, where he saw the threat'ning turrets rear Their battlements, he rush'd, resolv'd to try What fortune might betide, or for his Prince to die. LXXXVI Beneath the tow'ring pile he quickly stood. As it's wide front with warlike emblems deck'd And far-stretch'd range with heedful eye he view'd, It's height immense his expectation check'd. Now, if some recent and o'er-look'd defect An entrance might afford, the walls around With eager care he hasten'd to inspect. Vain was his toil; no op'ning there he found, But firm, compact and strong the rugged turret frown'd: LXXXVII Save where aloft, by gratings well secur'd, A small and narrow window he espied, Which to the hapless wretch within immur'd A portion scant of light and air supplied. Yet all access it's altitude defied. Not more it's state inviolate maintains The eagle's nest on Snowdon's craggy side, Where in secluded majesty he reigns, And rears his princely brood, and human pow'r disdains. LXXXVIII Here he conceiv'd the Chief in bondage lay: But still the fissure straight so distant seem'd, That to the dreary dungeon to convey His cheering voice impossible he deem'd: No sounds were heard, nor from the Castle gleam'd The passing torches of the wearied guard: Oppress'd by toil they slept, and, as they dream'd Of old encounters and of labours hard, In slumbers deep they lost the duties of their ward. LXXXIX Impatient the mysterious truth to know, He caught his harp, and struck a gentle note. The chord, half-vibrating, subdued and low, Scarce on the midnight breeze appear'd to float. Softly it stole along the tranquil moat, As when, amid some lonely wood's retreat, Desponding Philomel attunes her throat Her melancholy fortunes to repeat, Her song she oft renews with cadence sad and sweet. XC He paus'd awhile, but all was mute and still. Again his harp he struck with firmer hand, And modulations drew more loud and shrill, Such as were wont, on Judah's holy strand, With pious rage t' inflame the martial band. The pow'rful harmony ascended high, Thro' the wide air it's influence to expand. Once more the strong vibration seem'd to die, When from the tow'r was heard a deep and long-drawn sigh. XCI The mournful sound electrified his soul: Thoughtful he stood, yet firm and unappall'd. His cherish'd hope now rose beyond controul, That here his much-lov'd Monarch lay enthrall'd. Now to his working fancy he recall'd The scenes of early youth, when on the plain Of fair Poictou in princely state install'd The gallant Richard held his peaceful reign, And fram'd the lively song, and rais'd the tender strain. XCII 'Twas there, ere yet the fatal feuds arose Which chang'd for war's alarms those scenes of joy, That Richard oft delighted to compose The varying verse; to sing his lady coy The hour of rest full oft would he employ. Blondel alone those pleasing moments shar'd; Full well their common song accus'd the boy, Whose wanton malice neither heart had spar'd, And still with practis'd art his venom'd shafts prepar'd. XCIII Of these a sweet and well-remember'd air Blondel selected, which with fond delight His Prince had form'd for the capricious fair Who paid his ardent vows with scorn and slight: And thus he sung—“While to your beauty bright “I homage pay, and lowly bend the knee, “Vain are your charms true passion to excite: “Coldness but ill with raptures can agree; “Yet still my patience lasts, while all are shunn'd like me.” XCIV He ceas'd th' imperfect strain, and fix'd remain'd In mute expectancy to catch the sound Which from the tow'r might come. Deep silence reign'd, When thus a manly voice, in notes profound, Responsive sung—“No nymph my heart can wound, “If other captives she attempts t' ensnare, “And sheds her smiles and graces all around: “Rather her scorn and hatred would I bear, “Than own her worthless sway, and love with others share.” XCV “It is, it is my Richard!” cried Blondel, “He lives to crown his faithful people's love! “Oh! ease my tortur'd bosom, deign to tell “What cruel fate and envious fortune drove “Our gallant Prince this sad reverse to prove? “Oh let thy welcome voice my senses bless! “Say, can my care, my toils, my life remove “My Monarch's woe, or aid his deep distress? “Say, can my favour'd hand his mighty wrongs redress?” XCVI “Thank Heav'n!” replied the Prince, “at length my pray'r “Hath found acceptance at the Eternal Throne. “While doom'd to bonds and solitary care, “Oft has my sad and wearied spirit flown “To that great Pow'r who mercy now hath shewn. “Lov'd friend! and is it then thy voice I hear? “Amid the horrors of this turret lone “It comes the sorrows of my heart to cheer, “To ease my tortur'd breast, and calm my anxious fear. XCVII “Much have I lately known of shame and pain: “Severely has th' Almighty's pow'rful hand “Chastis'd my faults, but not chastis'd in vain. “Know, my Blondel! as, wreck'd on Austria's strand, “I journey'd to revisit Albion's land, “The vengeful Leopold thy master seiz'd. “Some months I lay beneath his stern command; “While he, to glut his malice dire well pleas'd, “Wreak'd on my captive head his fury unappeas'd. XCVIII “Whate'er of contumely could disgrace, “Whate'er of want could pang, I then sustain'd; “But want nor contumely could debase “My constant heart; his pow'r I still disdain'd, “With patience bore his wrongs, nor e'er complain'd. “Richard might captive be, but still his soul “Free and unmov'd it's dignity maintain'd: “For ne'er th' immortal spirit owns controul; “Serene and firm it stands, tho' thunders round it roll. XCIX “At length to change my fate high Heav'n decreed: “But yet in change no comfort could I find. “From Leopold's base tyranny tho' freed, “To bloody Henry's sway severe consign'd “My wayward fortune still was found unkind. “Oh stain to chivalry! oh blot to fame! “Oh strange contempt of all the ties that bind “Th' associate warriors of the Christian name! “Curs'd be your foul designs, and lasting be your shame! C “But let me not in weak revilings waste “The precious moments of our converse brief. “My soul already feels a fond foretaste “Of coming joy, and 'mid my heart-felt grief “Hope cheering smiles and promises relief. “But ah! what sorrows may be yet in store, “What miseries yet unknown and past belief! “Say, my Blondel, does she whom I adore “Yet live, or must my heart her cruel loss deplore?” CI “Her absent lord lamenting,” said Blondel, “In woe the lovely Berengaria lives. “Her moisten'd eye and heaving bosom tell “The agony which hope protracted gives: “Her gentle spirit with her sorrows strives; “Like the poor dove, whose mate no more returns, “From bliss foregone she present pain derives, “Still with a pure and constant flame she burns, “Droops her dejected head, and lost in anguish mourns.” CII “Thy words,” return'd the Prince, “like sov'reign balm “O'er my rack'd soul their healing influence shed. “Proceed, Blondel! my painful doubts to calm: “Does my base brother still rebellion spread? “Does Philip, nurs'd in frauds, in treasons bred, “Confed'rate still his purpose vile provoke? “Say, are my troops to fame and conquest led, “Or check'd by foreign foes, their spirits broke, “Yield they to Gallic force, and bear th' inglorious yoke?” CIII “If,” said Blondel, “his charge the shepherd leave, “The hungry wolf upon his flock will prey. “So John, well-vers'd in cunning to deceive, “When far his noble brother was away, “Disdain'd his great vicegerents to obey. “By subtle workings and encounters rude “He seiz'd such castles as defenceless lay, “And, urg'd by treach'rous France, his course pursued “To snatch at England's crown, and bathe her fields with blood. CIV “But soon the spirit of the nation rose. “Tho' some misled in error's mazes rov'd, “False to themselves, and to their country foes, “Yet English loyalty untainted prov'd. “By gen'rous scorn and indignation mov'd, “They rush'd the royal Elinor to join, “And grace the banner of their King belov'd. “With her their pow'rful efforts they combine, “And soon the rebel chiefs their conquests must resign. CV “Such are the fortunes of your suff'ring realm. “Meantime, your faithful English urge their pray'r, “That Richard soon may re-assume the helm; “And royal Elinor, with pious care, “Studious the means of safety to prepare, “Her trusty messengers thro' Europe's bound “To seek their King commissions to repair. “Of these Blondel with blest success is crown'd, “Well are his toils repaid, his King, his friend, is found.” CVI “It glads my woe-worn heart,” the Prince replied, “That England to herself and King is true. “May my ungrateful brother's guilty pride “Full retribution meet and vengeance due! “May Gallia's perjur'd King his treach'ry rue! “Grant me, ye fav'ring Powers! these bonds to break; “Then, when allow'd the traitor to pursue. “Injurious Philip thro' his realm I'll seek, “Nor cease, 'till on his head my just revenge I wreak. CVII “But ah! how weak my threats! my anxious mind “Vainly it's torments seeks by words t' assuage. “Torn from his native forests and confin'd “The lordly lion thus exhausts his rage, “And tears with fury impotent his cage. “Blondel! I charge thee seek the English coast, “Report my wayward fortunes, and engage “My faithful Barons to prepare their host, “Their Monarch to reclaim, to win my freedom lost. CVIII “In friendship's warm and vivid colours paint “The suff'rings of your King: their gen'rous zeal “Will urge them to conclude my base restraint. “Tell them, to English virtue I appeal. “Their Richard's woes when English bosoms feel, “Thousands will rush to vindicate his wrong, “His honour to assert, his wounds to heal: “His foes to check resistless will they throng, “Bold in the sacred cause, in loyal feelings strong. CIX “Haste, my Blondel, to England's court repair. “The wasting night now quits her high domain, “And o'er th' horizon wide the morning fair “Approaches fast to re-assume her reign. “Haply some stranger passing o'er the plain “May mark thy station, or my guard severe, “Observing thee, thy progress may restrain. “Adieu, my friend! thy course to England steer, “To all who love their lord my best remembrance bear.” CX “Nor day, nor night my slacken'd course shall see,” Return'd Blondel; “to England's court I go, “Of ills disdainful while inspir'd by thee. “My welcome voice their Monarch's fate shall shew, “And, as their breasts with cordial pity glow, “Doubt not their hands the ready sword will wield. “No sleep these eyes, these limbs no rest shall know, “'Till, by my words to vengeful ardour steel'd, “Your Barons well array'd shall croud the martial field. CXI “Then, when their valour shall have gain'd the prize, “And traitors mourn their merited defeat, “When victory o'er the gallant Richard flies, “And England's Monarch fills his rightful seat, “Let fame th' attachment of your friend repeat. “Farewell, lov'd Prince! may angels be thy guard, “May seraphs hover o'er thy dread retreat, “Lighten thy woes, and ease thy suff'rings hard! “Soon will propitious Heav'n thy constancy reward.” CXII He said, and from the Castle bent his way. Now from the east the rising splendour glow'd, And o'er the dusky sky brought on the day: The tinted radiance o'er th' horizon flow'd, While blushing morn with rosy fingers strew'd On every herb and flow'r ambrosial dew. Tow'rds the thick wood impatiently he strode, His minstrel's garments there to shroud from view, And in his palmer's weeds his travel to renew. CXIII Dark shew'd the forest, yet no more the trees Those horrid shapes and ghastly forms display'd, Which, as high waving to the midnight breeze, His troubled fancy lately had pourtray'd. Airy and light they wanton'd o'er the shade, While, 'midst their foliage hid, on every bough Their rounds fantastic birds unnumber'd play'd, Breathing in accents loud or murmurs low Th' instinctive strain of love, th' inviolated vow. CXIV Blondel, delighted with the tuneful choir, The path which led within the wood pursued. There he resum'd his pilgrim's meek attire, And, hast'ning back, prepar'd with zeal renew'd T' atchieve the perils of his travel rude. As thro' Heav'n's arch the sun ascended high, Gilt by it's rays again the tow'r he view'd, Where fate ordain'd his much-lov'd King to lie. In mute suspense he gaz'd, and heav'd the frequent sigh. CXV Thus when, from Afric's hapless regions torn, The trembling victim of colonial crimes To unknown scenes of wretchedness is borne; Oft does his mind recur to happier times, Oft does his fancy trace his native climes, His parent's tenderness, his children's love, And each fond tie which feeling souls sublimes: But present pangs th' illusion soft remove, He wakes from dreams of bliss his tyrant's pow'r to prove. CXVI Across his mind such sad reflections glanc'd, As on the tow'r his ling'ring eyes he bent: Awhile he pensive stood, as one entranc'd; But reason soon her aid consoling lent: With step resolv'd across the heath he went, Nor stopp'd, 'till, reaching Antwerp's proud domain, By ceaseless cares and labour nearly spent, He dar'd the perils of the sea again, With welcome tidings charg'd to ease his country's pain. END OF BOOK III. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. Blondel's success being known, the Queen summons a Council—Leicester is charged with the defence of Normandy —Mortimer, Pembroke, and Blondel are commissioned to demand of the Emperor the King's release—Their expedition—They learn that the Princes of the Empire, hearing of Richard's captivity, had compelled the Emperor to call a Diet, for the purpose of negociating his release —They arrive at Worms, and have an audience of the Emperor —Belial appears to Henry—Commencement of the Diet—Richard is brought before it—The Emperor states his charges against him. I While thus Blondel with ceaseless ardour wrought, Against domestic foes, whose fury dread T' o'erwhelm their too-long harrass'd country sought, Their warlike bands the faithful Barons led. Far was the scourge of desolation spread: Throughout the land, with wild vindictive sway, Their influence dire associate dæmons shed, And, as the rebels march'd in stern array, Their cry portended death, and ruin mark'd their way. II On ev'ry side was heard the trump of war: High in the air unnumber'd banners wav'd, And shew'd their rich emblazonments afar. The gen'rous steed no more his fleet limbs lav'd In lake or stream; the conflict rude he brav'd, Arch'd his high neck, and shook his flowing mane: The Chanfron rich and Poitrinal engrav'd Firm and erect he bore; with proud disdain He scal'd th' impending cliff, or scour'd along the plain. III As when, at eve's approach, the Alpine swain Sounds from his deep-ton'd tube th' accustom'd lay, To call his stragglers from the grassy plain, Th' obedient flock his warning note obey; No more 'midst flow'ry meads his lambkins play, His goats no longer o'er the mountains roam, Bound o'er the hills and on their summits stray, While far beneath them thund'ring torrents foam: They own their master's voice, and seek with him their home. IV So, when was heard their Chieftain's welcome call, With loyal feelings and attachment true To every castle strong and moated hall The zealous vassalry of England flew. With weapons there supplied and armour due, Each gallant leader train'd his eager band: Before him as they pass'd in long review, He felt with transports fresh his heart expand, Ardour illum'd his eye, and hope his bosom fann'd. V Recruited thus, no more Fitz-Peter check'd The gen'rous impulse which his forces warm'd. He taught the fierce Llewellyn to respect The laws of war: where'er his power alarm'd The tranquil seat of innocence unarm'd, Dauntless he rush'd the victims weak to save. In ev'ry quarter where the foemen swarm'd, They fled confus'd before his legions brave, Or fell beneath his sword, and found an early grave. VI From Trenta's verdant meads, where wav'd aloft The hostile standards with barbaric pride, As if at England's pow'r they madly scoff'd, He drove the rude invaders; far and wide Their purple gore the fertile vallies dy'd. Nor less from Luna's stream with peerless might He chas'd the caitiffs who her arms defied, 'Till, once more gaining Snowdon's craggy height, They hid their recreant heads, and mourn'd their hapless plight. VII Nor less prevail'd the now augmented host Of brave Brywere: the rebel bands he sought, And check'd with hand severe their daring boast. Vain were the arts by fiends insidious taught, And fruitless all the stratagems they wrought: From Thames's bank their weaken'd force retir'd. Where'er with loyalty indignant fraught He turn'd his course, by his example fir'd, England's bold youth to deeds of hardihood aspir'd. VIII Yet still on Nottingham's and Windsor's tow'rs The rebel standards flew. These to invest With unremitting zeal he led his pow'rs, On ev'ry side the harrass'd foe distress'd, And either siege with ceaseless ardour press'd. But, tho' oft-times advantages he gain'd, Still, unsubdued by toil and want of rest, His fierce assaults the rebel hosts sustain'd, And brave, tho' guilty, still his proferr'd terms disdain'd. IX While thus he worthily employ'd his force, A Courier, hot with travel, to his tent With haste impatient rush'd. His panting horse, Still smarting from the spur, by labour spent, And white with foam, confess'd his high intent. He wav'd his hand, and, leaping to the ground, “Chieftain!” cried he, “by Elinor I'm sent, “Throughout your ranks to spread the joyful sound, “That royal Richard lives, that England's King is found.” X Th' assembled croud the welcome tidings hail'd; Thro' ev'ry rank soon spread th' exulting cry, And transport wild and extacy prevail'd. Thus, when in wintry night to stubble dry Their flaming brands industrious hinds apply, O'er the wide champaign far extends the blaze; The wanton element illumes the sky, And, while around it's splendour it displays, The distant villagers in silent wonder gaze. XI Soon as the first glad tumult was appeas'd, Brywere exclaim'd, “The tidings which you bring “Of Richard's safety I have heard well pleas'd. “From woe fore-gone redoubled transports spring. “Now, in the future triumphs of their King “Let ev'ry brave and loyal warrior share! “With sounds of joy let Heav'n's high concave ring! “And, while the brazen trumpet rends the air, “It's blast shall strike our foes with terror and despair!” XII Thus bad the Chief. At once throughout the croud The martial symphony far-pealing broke: The clarion shrill, the trumpet's clangor loud, The echoing horn, the drum's redoubling stroke, Join'd in exulting chorus to provoke The grateful hymn of praise from every tongue. It's fervid strain their pious ardour spoke; And still, as rose the deep-impassion'd song, They bless'd the pow'r supreme, th' avenger of their wrong. XIII While thus the joyful band their thanks express'd, The Courier to Brywere at length explain'd Blondel's long dubious yet successful quest: How, in disguise, and under semblance feign'd, To dread Trivallis he admission gain'd, And how, tho' baffled in his first essay, He learn'd that there his Monarch was detain'd. As thus he spoke, tears oft would force their way, And oft a rising sigh his feelings would betray. XIV But soon as nature's tribute he had paid, He check'd the fond effusion of his grief, And thus the purpose of his charge display'd. “The presence of each wise and loyal chief “The Queen requires, whose counsels sage and brief “May scan th' important crisis of our fate, “To suff'ring Richard may insure relief, “Save him from Henry's unrelenting hate, “And guard from dangers new our agitated state.” XV “The great occasion prompt resolve demands,” Replied Brywere; “obedient to her will “To delegated rule I leave my bands, “And haste her high injunction to fulfil. “Chandos! be thine the task with warlike skill “To hold beleaguer'd stately Windsor's tow'r; “While Audley brave, and gallant Somerville, “Direct our cavalry's resistless pow'r “With active vigilance on ev'ry side to scour. XVI “Saville, renown'd in war! be thine the care “To Nottingham, where Lacy presses close “The nearly-vanquish'd rebels, to repair. “Tell him, that past are suff'ring England's woes, “That once again our King shall face his foes. “With freshen'd ardour and redoubled zeal “Let him his engines of attack dispose, “'Till, 'midst their shatter'd battlements, they feel “The vengeance of our arms, and for our mercy kneel.” XVII He said; and forthwith, vaulting on his steed, To Windsor's heights he bad a short adieu, And to the court advanc'd with anxious speed. Across th' extending plains his courser flew Uncheck'd, 'till rising to his earnest view He hail'd the walls of London, stretching wide Her circuit vast and princely towers to shew, As, with becoming state and seemly pride, Pre-eminent she rose, and grac'd old Thames's side. XVIII Her ramparts high he sought not now to gain. Thro' Charing's hamlet pass'd, his courser fleet Soon brought him to the long-ennobled plain, Where Westminster display'd her regal seat, Of Saxon monarchs the renown'd retreat. He cross'd the portal and the halls in haste The Queen and England's puissant peers to meet, Where they the means in secret council trac'd To aid their King condemn'd his hours in woe to waste. XIX Above the rest, as well her rank became, The royal Elinor presiding sat, Guardian of Albion and of Richard's fame. On either hand the Peers in order'd state Grac'd the full board, and held their high debate: The mitred Prelates, by whose counsels sage The Queen still rul'd; Pembroke in battle great, Leicester, who oft had dar'd the Pagan rage, And Mortimer well skill'd the doubtful war to wage. XX There too Mauleon held his worthy place, And Granville bold, who erst associate wore The badge of faith religion's cause to grace; Neville renown'd, and Reginald who bore The royal standard on Judæa's shore, Fitz-Allwyn wise, and Henry of Almaigne, With Hubert deeply read in antient lore, And brave Blondel, who late with care and pain Dar'd for his Sovereign's sake his foreign toil sustain. XXI These, as Brywere approach'd, in thought profound And silence deep which rev'rence meet express'd Listen'd, as to the Peers assembled round The gallant Leicester his discourse address'd. Sudden he stopp'd, and welcome glad confess'd. Brywere return'd his greeting with respect, Then pray'd the Earl no longer to arrest His purpos'd counsel, whose advice correct Their judgments might decide, their common voice direct. XXII “Doubtless,” resum'd the Earl, “the time demands “That, with advice assur'd and counsels sage, “With voice unanimous and willing hands, “We should in this, our country's cause, engage. “Her suff'rings, caus'd by elemental rage, “By plague, by famine, and her Monarch's woe, “It well becomes our stations to assuage. “Let firm resolve on wisdom founded shew “The blest effects from zeal and loyalty which flow. XXIII “Nor may we Heav'n's kind providence distrust. “E'en in the dreadful hour, when traitors base “With rude irruption and pretence unjust “O'er England's bosom dar'd their course to trace, “Our righteous cause o'erwhelm'd them with disgrace. “Where are their conquests now? their triumphs high? “Driv'n from the field, our arms no more they face, “No more the combat's bloody issue try, “But vanquish'd hide their shame, and from our legions fly. XXIV “Our shatter'd realm no longer treasons shake; “No more the jarring sounds of civic broil “To deeds of foul import the soul awake. “The further task, John's black attempt to foil, “By thine, Brywere! and brave Fitz-Peter's toil “Is happily advanc'd. It now remains “To check the foes who Normandy despoil, “To free our Monarch from th' inglorious chains “In which base Henry's pow'r his war-tried limbs retains. XXV “He hopes, and rightly does he deem I trust, “That we, whose breasts with loyalty beat high, “Our King to rescue from his grasp unjust “With lib'ral hand his ransom will supply. “Lives there the wretch who would the means deny “Of saving him on whom the state depends? “I see your spirits kindling in each eye, “The patriot flame thro' ev'ry nerve ascends, “New strength to England's realm your gen'rous purpose lends. XXVI “While some to Holy Rome their course pursue, “Let others to imperial Worms repair. “In terms appropriate, and with firmness due, “Let them our wrongs and just demands declare. “If Henry to refuse redress shall dare, “Let them defiance and revenge proclaim, “And shake his soul with terror and despair. “Tho' bold in guilt, yet, when convicted, tame, “The tyrant base will crouch at England's awful name. XXVII “Thus, while our first great duty we fulfil, “To stem the inroads of our Gallic foe “Twere fit to name some Chief of well-tried skill, “Whose ample pow'rs may ward the menac'd blow, “And in the tented field to Philip shew “Our English valour and untainted zeal. “Oh Queen! to me this enterprize allow: “The proud oppressor soon my force shall feel, “Or death by honour crown'd my loyalty shall seal.” XXVIII Thus spake the vet'ran Chief. His counsels sage, In silence heard, sank deep in every breast. Thus, when o'erpast the rattling tempest's rage, As if with awe and wonder still impress'd In calm repose all nature seems to rest; Mute ev'ry breath, and hush'd each ruder sound: While, from his golden chamber in the west, The setting sun with dazzling radiance crown'd Sheds his transcendent beams, and spreads delight around. XXIX Immers'd in thought profound the Peers remain'd; Each eye up-rais'd enraptur'd seem'd t' invoke Th' Eternal Power who England's realm maintain'd, When thus the Queen th' assembly grave bespoke. “Illustrious Chiefs! to ward th' impending stroke “Which adverse fortune levell'd at our state, “Rightly I judg'd this council to convoke, “Where you, alike in arms and wisdom great, “Might for our country's weal with common voice debate. XXX “Sage your advice I deem. Our Gallic foes, “Who now o'er Normandy's rich province dare “Urge their fell hate, let Leicester's Earl oppose. “While here, with haste and unremitting care, “The means of Richard's ransom we prepare, “Let Mortimer, commission'd in our name, “To bloody Henry proud defiance bear; “Let him our wrongs and menac'd wrath proclaim, “And urge him to redeem his prostituted fame. XXXI “From Rome's dread Pontiff succour to intreat “Th' important task to Hubert we assign. “If these appointments your concurrence meet, “Let us, while thus our efforts we combine, “Implore Heav'n's sov'reign aid. The Power divine, “Th' immortal guardian of our favour'd isle, “Still to our supplications will incline; “Still on our pious energy will smile, “Confirm our patriot zeal, and sanctify our toil.” XXXII Thus spoke th' undaunted Queen. With awe impress'd Th' admiring Peers approv'd her counsels sage, When Mortimer th' assembly thus address'd. “In tented fields tumultuous war to wage, “To dare in battle's front the foeman's rage, “My time has been employ'd: I boast no skill “In state intrigues with courtiers to engage; “Yet to my Monarch's cause devoted still, “Behold! I stand prepar'd your pleasure to fulfil. XXXIII “To Henry's court, as wills the Queen, I go: “But, rude of speech, I fear my terms uncouth “In soft persuasion's stream but ill may flow. “Would Pembroke, lov'd companion of my youth, “And brave Blondel, renown'd for loyal truth, “Join to my hearty zeal their pow'rful aid, “My path perplex'd their eloquence will smooth; “Well shall our country's wrongs be then display'd, “And England's menac'd wrath in terrors be array'd.” XXXIV Thus Mortimer. In kind and courteous guise, As honour'd by his choice, the warlike pair Spoke their assent to grace his enterprise. And now their arms and followers to prepare, As well their rank became, employ'd their care. An hundred bold and vet'ran knights they chose To form their squadron and their toil to share, Who oft, in conflict with their Pagan foes, On Judah's plains had learn'd their fury to oppose. XXXV As o'er the Kentish plains their way they took, While their white plumes high wav'd from every crest, Their gallant steeds, whose hoofs the champaign shook, With neighings loud their eagerness express'd, And, as if conscious of their purpos'd quest, Urg'd their fleet course, and proudly spurn'd the ground. Towards Dover's port their travel they address'd, Where shelter'd by the cliffs that tower'd around, In happy hour arriv'd, their ready barks they found. XXXVI Clear was the sky, and fav'ring was the gale. The busy mariners their anchors weigh'd, And stretch'd with dext'rous hand the flowing sail: The curling billows round the vessels play'd, While, on the top-mast's giddy height array'd, Courting the breeze the blood-red pennants flew: The pilot's skill the gliding barks obey'd, And, as loud caroll'd the observant crew, Old England's white-rob'd coasts receded from their view. XXXVII Now sank the sun beneath the western wave, While, in calm majesty, the queen of night From Heav'n's high arch her silv'ry lustre gave, Tinging the waters with her radiance white. The crouded warriors hail'd her welcome light; And Pembroke, as the deck he slowly pac'd, With Mortimer discours'd of many a fight, And many a combat's varied feats he trac'd, Where the ensanguin'd cross by victory had been grac'd. XXXVIII Far from the rest, immers'd in thought profound Blondel, regardless of their converse, fat. He cast his eyes the tranquil scene around, Recalling all that had occurr'd of late, When, to investigate his Monarch's fate, He cross'd the sea, and sought Germania's strand. Of dread Trivallis and of Austria's hate He mus'd; and much the present perils scann'd, Which menac'd his lov'd Lord from ruthless Henry's hand. XXXIX As with impatience in his mind he turn'd How his enlargement he might best obtain, His breast with hopes and fears alternate burn'd, With op'ning joy, and oft recurring pain. Unable now his feelings to restrain, He join'd th' associate Chiefs. In converse deep They pass'd the night, till o'er th' empurpled main Fresh from the east the morn began to creep, And the bright sun thro' Heav'n commenc'd his progress steep. XL The crew exulting hail'd his cheerful ray, And, as their sails the fav'ring zephyrs swell'd, The nimble barks pursued their destin'd way. Soon the rich coasts of Flandria they beheld, Where, charg'd with Europe's wealth, the princely Scheld His ample tribute to old ocean pours. O'er his broad surface by the gale impell'd, Well pleas'd they gaz'd upon his fertile shores, Where nature's hand display'd her variegated stores. XLI On Antwerp's quay they hasten'd now to land. Soon, from their toils refresh'd, the Chieftains drew In duly order'd rank the gallant band, And, their high purpose anxious to renew, Urg'd their fleet steeds their travel to pursue. With vig'rous course they held their eager quest; And now to Flandria's plains they bad adieu, And o'er Germania's spreading regions press'd, While loyalty and zeal inspir'd each gen'rous breast. XLII O'er hill and valley they pursued their way, Now skirting Rhine's broad stream, where seated high, In rude sublimity and wild array, Unnumber'd castles brav'd th' inclement sky, Now passing o'er the fertile vales which lie On either bank, with corn and vineyards fair. As still they journey'd on, they chanc'd descry A troop array'd in habits gay and rare, Whose banners wide unfurl'd wav'd proudly in the air. XLIII On these were seen the Magi who ador'd The Babe Divine, who from his heav'nly throne Descending, deign'd salvation to afford, Whose humble roof the eastern star had shewn. Before the well-arm'd band there rode alone, With stole of white and rochet rich bedeck'd, The princely Bishop of far-fam'd Cologne. His silver'd hairs and countenance erect Announc'd his worth, and claim'd well-merited respect. XLIV Gladly the English knights the prince beheld, And, to o'ertake him, with augmented haste Across the plain their coursers they impell'd. The prelate, as their near approach he trac'd, Which spoke some high intent, more slowly pac'd; But, when their standard he distinctly saw, Which the ensanguin'd cross superbly grac'd, Emblem of Christ, and of Christ's holy law, His heart with joy beat high and reverential awe. XLV “Warriors!” he cried, “by Him whom impious force “On yonder cross compell'd erewhile to bleed, “Whither and whence ye bend your purpos'd course, “And why thus arm'd, I pray ye to aread.” “Urg'd by a base and most unknightly deed,” Cried Pembroke, “and our captive King to aid, “Towards Henry's court from England we proceed. “Too long the tyrant has his power display'd, “Too long has mourn'd our Prince by treach'ry foul betray'd. XLVI “In me,” and as he spake his helm he rais'd, “Pembroke, your friend and comrade lov'd behold; “Yon puissant knight, in armour black encas'd, “Is Mortimer, in many a fight grown old, “And he, with scarf of green, Blondel the bold.” Forthwith the Prince, his friend rememb'ring well, Stretch'd forth his arms, and much rejoic'd t' infold His brave compeer, while tears of transport fell, As mutually they sought of past events to tell. XLVII “Well pleas'd, illustrious knights!” the Prelate cried, “The purpose of your mission I have heard. “Tho' Henry may attempt his guilt to hide, “Your King's release no more shall be deferr'd. “Germania's potentates their faulchions gird; “Moguntia's Prince, of Cleves the potent Earl, “Saxonia's Duke, and Brunswick's Chief rever'd, “Their banners high indignantly unfurl, “And 'gainst the tyrant base their joint defiance hurl. XLVIII “For, tho' with watchful care and jealous heed “Henry his pris'ner's state forlorn conceal'd, “At length the hateful and unknightly deed “By Heav'n's immediate guidance was reveal'd. “Austria's stern Duke, whose heart by vengeance steel'd “Detain'd the gallant Prince in harsh duress, “Compell'd to sickness and to pain to yield, “Obey'd the voice, which urg'd him to confess “His guilt, and when too late contrition to express. XLIX “Forthwith Germania's peers, in numbers strong, “Call'd on their Chief the causes to assign “Which led him thus your injur'd King to wrong. “With them my warmest efforts I combine; “And hasten now at Worms their bands to join, “Where in the Diet, with to-morrow's light, “We mean to prosecute our great design. “I little need your ardour to incite, “Or urge you in the task your efforts to unite.” L Th' attentive warriors his discourse approv'd, And, still the means discussing how they best Might ease the suff'rings of their King belov'd, Heedless of toil, and negligent of rest, Their vig'rous steeds incessantly they press'd, 'Till to th' imperial ramparts they drew nigh, What time the setting sun approach'd the west, And misty clouds across th' encrimson'd sky, Betok'ning night's approach, in varied forms 'gan fly. LI “Here,” said the Prince, “awhile, brave knights! remain: “'Twere right some fitting messenger to send, “An audience from the monarch to obtain; “While I prepare, with many a gen'rous friend, “Such aid as best may suit your views to lend. “Well pleas'd will they your worth distinguish'd greet, “And gladly will they on your steps attend, “When with the proud oppressor first ye meet, “Of England's just complaint and Richard's wrongs to treat.” LII Thus saying, to the gate his course he bent, While Basset, by the chieftains charg'd to bear Notice of their approach and high intent, To Henry's presence hasten'd to repair. Meantime, the warriors, with becoming care, Discuss'd the points which Cologne's Prince had told, And sought the means most aptly to declare The hostile purport of their mission bold, Should still injurious force complete redress withhold. LIII Their gen'rous bosoms burn'd with loyal flame, And proud defiance sat on every brow, When from the gate forth issuing Basset came. Approaching near, he bent with rev'rence low, Then thus began: “Illustrious chieftains! know “Imperial Henry charges me to say, “He waits with much impatience, 'till you shew “Why to his presence thus you take your way, “And why your standards wave in menacing array.” LIV His words indignantly the Chiefs receiv'd, Suspecting that with machinations new The treasons, which he foully had atchiev'd, He purpos'd still unsated to pursue. Yet stay'd they not their course: in order due Through the throng'd town they gallantly advanc'd. When to the royal palace near they drew, O'er its wide front their eyes admiring glanc'd, Where the materials rich the workman's skill enhanc'd. LV As from their foaming steeds the chiefs descend, The courtly heralds hast'ning from the gate, Upon their steps obediently attend, 'Till to the hall they came, where thron'd in state, Expecting their approach, the Emp'ror sat, And round him, forming an august divan, Assembled Princes stood his will t' await. Throughout their ranks approving murmurs ran, When, stretching forth his hand, thus brave Blondel began. LVI “Charg'd by the powers, who now of Albion's land “The watchful cares of government sustain, “Before this presence dignified we stand, “To state our wrongs, and justice to obtain. “Our cause is good, nor can our suit be vain: “For, tho' oppression may awhile display “Her impious force, and honour foully stain, “Immortal truth will vindicate her sway, “And guilt's recesses dark illumine with her ray. LVII “By us our country speaks: in England's name, “Her Monarch's freedom from injurious thrall, “And full redress from thee we boldly claim. “If, deaf to conscience, you reject our call, “Think on the woes, which may thy state befal “From England's arms and congregated pow'r: “Let her denounc'd revenge thy soul appal; “And timely deprecate the fearful hour, “When for her injur'd King her vengeance she shall show'r.” LVIII “Free welcome, Chiefs!” replied the Prince, “receive: “Yet, while your presence dignifies my court, “You must allow me, noble Sirs! to grieve, “That, trusting to a vague and false report, “A charge of deep and horrible import, “Most foreign to my soul, you rashly bring. “Thus does suspicion still the truth distort; “Thus calumny expands her treach'rous wing, “On unsuspecting worth her venom'd darts to fling. LIX “You talk of guilt, and of your Monarch's wrong. “Tho' confident your terms, yet I respect “The rights which to your character belong, “And, tho' misus'd, your persons will protect. “Thus stands the truth. When, in Dalmatia wreck'd, “Your warlike King by Austria's Duke was seiz'd, “I deem'd it wrong th' occasion to neglect, “Which offer'd vengeance for my friend deceas'd, “For most unknightly deeds, and crimes yet unappeas'd.” LX As from his eye keen indignation flash'd, And anger ting'd his cheek with vivid hues, To earth stern Mortimer his gauntlet dash'd: “Thy proofs,” he cried, “I dare thee to produce! “It ill becomes thee basely thus to use “The Christian champion, who, when paltry fear “Urg'd thee thy foul omission to excuse, “Dar'd on Judæa's shores the cross to bear, “And from the Pagan foe his trophies proud to tear.” LXI “When on the hoary front time's with'ring hand,” Henry replied, “has strew'd the marks of age, “We might expect to meet with self-command, “With courteous bearing, and reflection sage, “Whose steady calmness might attemper rage, “And check the rebel passions as they rise. “I mean not, Chieftain! wordy war to wage: “When in small compass the discussion lies, “Unseemly warmth the want of argument implies. LXII “'Tis true, your Monarch in my pow'r I hold; “And, did th' occasion suit the cause t' explain, “Easy it were with reasons manifold “The justice of my conduct to maintain. “But such details would now be made in vain: “For know, brave Knights! ere to my court you came, “I pledg'd my word to yonder princely train, “That they, appreciating your Sov'reign's blame, “Should on his guilt pronounce or justify his fame. LXIII “To-morrow's sun will view th' assembly meet. “Then to Germania's chiefs my charges grave, “Detail'd and full, I purpose to repeat. “Then shall your Monarch free admission have, “To plead his cause, his high renown to save, “And from imputed wrongs himself to clear. “There too your presence equally I crave, “That you the solemn argument may hear, “And of the Diet's voice a just report may bear.” LXIV While with ambiguous phrase the tyrant spoke, And half the truth disclos'd and half conceal'd, From the surrounding Peers a murmur broke, Which indignation ill repress'd reveal'd. Thus, fable says, beneath Phlegrëa's field, When earth's imprison'd sons with giant force Attempt t' escape and arms again to wield, While rocks on rocks impos'd forbid their course, Far thro' the caverns deep resound their threat'nings hoarse. LXV Again to speak bold Mortimer essay'd; But Pembroke, who a quick advantage spied From Henry's craft, prevented him, and said, “Whether to truth or falsehood be allied “Thy specious plea, we need not now decide. “We hold thee pledg'd the causes to detail “Why to our King enlargement is denied: “The Diet's judgement will remove the veil “Which treach'ry foul has weav'd, and justice will prevail. LXVI “Henry! farewell; we confidently count “To-morrow here our injur'd King shall stand: “Then, when his suff'rings to their full amount “Shall be recorded, and his virtues scann'd, “Expect us to renew our just demand.” He ceas'd. The Princes courteously arose, And led the Chieftains to rejoin their band; For now departing day had reach'd its close, And sleep from mortals claim'd his tribute of repose. LXVII Her silent reign now solemn midnight held, And from her poppies soft oblivion shed, As high her cloudy chariot she impell'd, And deep her shadows o'er th' horizon spread. The conscious tyrant on his lofty bed Alone partook not of the gen'ral rest: From his still wakeful eye-lids slumber fled, While strong conflicting passions tore his breast, And shame, revenge and fear his lab'ring mind oppress'd. LXVIII Vainly to court her fost'ring aid he tried; But she, tho' oft invok'd, her calm repose To his still agitated soul denied. Thro' the deep gloom ideal phantoms rose, And flitting forms, as if denouncing woes, Quick gliding by his couch terrific pass'd, And groans were heard, and agonizing throes. Starting, around his eager eyes he cast To trace their course obscene, then sank with dread aghast. LXIX A clammy sweat his trembling limbs bedew'd, And wide diverging stood his bristling hair, While conscience her appalling charge renew'd, Shook her keen whip, and urg'd him to despair. With horror struck, he would have breath'd a prayer: But ere his tongue the impulse new obey'd, He heard the sound of pinions thro' the air, And straightway at his side appear'd a Shade, Of outline undefin'd, as if in clouds array'd. LXX It seem'd as though resembling human form, Of size gigantic and imperial mien, Black and confus'd, as when thro' wintry storm A mountain vast in mist obscure is seen, When brooding tempests robe it's summits green, And o'er it's brow contending meteors play. From what appear'd it's head flash'd light'nings keen, Casting around a blue sulphureous ray, Which fill'd the tyrant's soul with terror and dismay. LXXI Waving what shew'd a hand, around him broke In fearful chorus thunders loud and deep, While thus with accents harsh the vision spoke. “Henry! attend—from those recesses steep, “Where Heav'n's eternal foes their station keep, “Lo! Belial comes. While now my leader's foes “Expect the harvest of their toils to reap, “And Richard's thraldom fondly hope to close, “Mark my behest, and learn their efforts to oppose. LXXII “Let others for the substance shadows clasp! “But let more certain joys thy soul invite “A present good and triumphs sure to grasp. “Enjoy the vast ineffable delight, “To crush thy rival, his renown to blight, “To blast his glories with eternal shame. “If ought there need thy vengeance to excite, “Compare with thine his far-extending fame, “'Till thy vex'd bosom own the agitating flame. LXXIII “What if, on some remote and hostile strand, “Far from thy throne, and from thine empire torn, “Fate had condemn'd thee to a tyrant's hand? “Would not thy mind resentment deep have borne? “Would not remembrance' sharp and goading thorn “Have urg'd thee to a retribution strong? “Could'st thou forgive the stern oppressor's scorn, “Or check, when able to revenge thy wrong, “Thy rage matur'd by pains, and nurs'd by suff'rings long? LXXIV “Think then, if Richard should his throne regain, “Should he once more o'er England's pow'rful state, “Grac'd by renown, and flush'd with conquest reign, “Think on the ills which may thyself await. “Consult thy heart to estimate his hate. “If that shall warn thee of expected harm, “Prevent thy ruin ere it be too late: “Let not unfounded hopes suspicion charm, “Tempt thee to yield thy prey, thy fury to disarm. LXXV “Immortal Powers with thee their efforts join, “And me, their active minister, they send “To aid thy cause and prosper thy design, “Still on thy steps with watchful care t' attend, “Still thy vindictive measures to befriend, “And for to-morrow's proof thy soul to steel. “Then o'er thee shall my fav'ring wings extend; “I will instruct thee with the Peers to deal, “And skilfully the truth in mystery to conceal. LXXVI “Then with a firmness which becomes thy pride, “Arouse thee, Prince! th' expecting Chiefs to meet, “And on thy victim's fortunes to decide. “Think how immense the prize, revenge how sweet: “Still more reflect, that now there's no retreat “From instant judgment but submission base. “First weigh the horrors which attend defeat, “Then let thy fancy all the triumphs trace, “Which, when thy rival falls, thy victor brows shall grace.” LXXVII No more he added. Trembling and amaz'd The Prince in breathless agony remain'd, As on the phantom eagerly he gaz'd. It vanish'd, and again deep silence reign'd. Henry ere long his fortitude regain'd; And, confident of more than mortal aid, By neither pity nor remorse restrain'd, The dictates of th' imperious fiend obey'd, While in new falshoods cloath'd, his charges he array'd. LXXVIII The ploughman harness'd now his lusty team, And slowly o'er the glebe pursued his way; Now from th' horizon glanc'd the morn's grey beam, And o'er reposing nature shot it's ray; The early lark, her homage glad to pay, Caroll'd her hymn, and, pois'd on outspread wing, Hail'd the resplendent harbinger of day, Who gaily rose, charg'd by high Heav'n to bring To suff'ring England joy and freedom to her King. LXXIX Scarcely as yet his emanations bright Had ting'd the lofty tow'rs of Worms with gold, And scarcely yet, arous'd from slumbers light, Her gates the careful warders 'gan t' unfold When from their couches sprang the Chieftains bold. With gen'rous zeal their patriot bosoms beat, And much they yearn'd their Sov'reign to behold, As on they pass'd Germania's Peers to meet, Who now assembled stood their wish'd approach to greet. LXXX One common purpose fill'd each gallant heart; With ardour emulous and feelings high Each sought his aid and counsel to impart. But brief their converse: soon the trumpet's cry, With piercing note re-echoing to the sky, Announc'd th' imperial presence, and aloud Proclaim'd that now th' eventful hour was nigh. The Chieftains heard, and thro' th' admiring croud Advanc'd in splendid rank and with demeanour proud. LXXXI Before the palace, in well order'd state And long-protracted line, the guard was plac'd, The Princes of the empire to await: Their war-tried limbs in armour were encas'd, And helms with plumes surcharg'd their temples grac'd. With decent awe their ensigns to the ground Graceful they lower'd as on the Chieftains pass'd, While from their brazen tubes th' martial sound Symphonious rose and spread rich harmony around. LXXXII Now op'd the massive portals, to disclose The vaulted hall, where, beneath arches wide, Seats after seats high elevated rose, And grac'd with lengthen'd rank each spacious side. Above the rest, with purple splendour dy'd, O'er-canopied was seen th' imperial throne, Bedeck'd with lavish pomp and gaudy pride; Enchas'd in gold, full many a precious stone Resplendent beam'd, and far with dazzling lustre shone. LXXXIII The Peers arose the Chieftains to salute, But soon their stations re-assum'd, impress'd With deep suspense and expectation mute, While angry glances from each eye confess'd The feelings strong which throbb'd in ev'ry breast. Henry, who his intended wrong to cloak His face in counterfeited smiles had dress'd, With hand outstretch'd attention now bespoke, And thus with studied phrase the general silence broke. LXXXIV “No common topics now your doom abide; “No partial int'rests your decrees demand. “Convok'd the fate of empires to decide, “Before your bar a captive King will stand, “Whose warlike fame thro' Judah's distant land “Renown has grac'd with eulogy sublime. “Me, all averse, imperious calls command “To charge this Monarch, once our Europe's prime, “With many a foul offence and most unknightly crime. LXXXV “Fain would I shun the task I now fulfil: “Yet honour's voice and duties strict compel “With influence potent my reluctant will “On guilt presum'd and recreant deeds to dwell. “Should he my weighty charges answer well, “My suffrage, Princes! shall with your's unite: “But should strong proof your judgment sure impel “His varnish'd and untrue defence to slight, “On his attainted head let vengeance stern alight.” LXXXVI He ceas'd. Forthwith the gates wide-op'ning flew. All gaz'd, when, with an awe-commanding air, The martial King advancing met their view. His pallid cheek denoted past-gone care, And unconfin'd his flowing auburn hair With many a ringlet loose his temples crown'd: Erect he stood, as if his foes to dare; And, as with conscious majesty around His piercing eyes he cast, indignantly he frown'd. LXXXVII As when, pursuing her accustom'd way, The passing moon obscures the orb of light, And hides with mantle dark his noon-tide ray, The sad Peruvian on Pichinca's height, Mourns his great parent overwhelm'd in night; But, soon as 'gins retire th' invader dread, With wild acclaim he hails the victor bright, Exulting marks his beams reviving spread, Renew the day, and round ætherial splendour shed. LXXXVIII Such was the feeling of each gallant Chief, When first the Champion of the Cross they view'd, Still great in woe, still dignified in grief, And still by adverse fortune unsubdued. The Tyrant now arose. His bosom rude The cordial power of pity ne'er confess'd: But, with a look which hate vindictive shew'd, And gesture fierce which kindling rage express'd, Thus with imperious tone th' assembly he address'd. LXXXIX “At length, most noble Peers! the hour is come, “When England's King, whom gross offences stain, “Before your bar august awaits his doom. “To lend awhile your calm attention deign, “When of high crimes and treasons I arraign “Yon recreant Prince. With confidence I ask, “And trust your patient hearing to obtain, “While briefly I perform my painful task, “To tear from guilt's base front her hypocritic mask. XC “Let not his valour or his warlike fame “Your judgments to undue compassion lead: “'Tho' past deserts may your indulgence claim, “Yet justice still with greater force should plead. “When thus to state my charges I proceed, “On your impartial verdict I rely. “Religion's rights for vengeance intercede, “Insulted monarchs for redress apply, “And to high Heav'n ascends my murder'd kinsman's cry! XCI “First then, of treason Richard I accuse, “In that, regardless of my sov'reign right, “By specious arts and scandalous abuse “He aided Tancred my just hopes to blight. “From me that traitor, on pretences light, “Apulia's throne and Sicily withheld, “Mock'd at my vengeance, and disdain'd my might; “Yet would my pow'r his duty have compell'd, “Had not the English Prince his arrogance upheld. XCII “On him, who solemn faith and service swore, “I unsuspecting my reliance plac'd, “And look'd that he my kingdoms would restore: “But little guess'd I, that, by fraud debas'd, “By int'rest warp'd, and by deceit disgrac'd, “My false ally my deadly foe had join'd! “Too late his foul contrivances I trac'd, “When my fair claim reluctant I resign'd, “And yielded to their force and armament combin'd. XCIII “Next I accuse him, that, inflam'd with pride, “And prompted by ambition unrestrain'd, “He dar'd his hostile bands tow'rds Cyprus guide. “The isle to royal Isaac appertain'd: “There my ally and noble kinsman reign'd, “Not less for courtesy, than arms renown'd, “'Till, with invasion rude and purpose feign'd, “Occasion fit the faithless Richard found, “To spoil his peaceful realm, and spread dismay around. XCIV “Forgetful of the sacred badge he wore, “The Christian cause to succour he delay'd, “To glut his fury on a Christian shore. “The Isle he seiz'd: it's Prince a captive made, “And, as if bent the purple to degrade, “Th' imperial Chief in bonds he dar'd to hold, “And from his coasts insultingly convey'd. “Since when, induc'd by sordid thirst of gold, “His ill-acquir'd domain to strangers he has sold. XCV “Such were the proud exploits of England's Chief, “When to Judæa's too-long suff'ring strand “With simulated zeal he bore relief. “Mark now, how well he used his high command, “When, by th' insidious projects he had plann'd, “The guidance of their armaments he gain'd. “He rul'd the Chieftains with an iron hand, “Slighted their counsels, their advice disdain'd, “And with oppression strange his tyranny maintain'd.

CXIV “Princes! to you the pris'ner's fate I leave, “And with due def'rence your decree await. “If for Montferrat foully slain you grieve, “If for my wrongs, and those of Isaac's state, “For Austria's honour, for Religion's fate, “And Philip's just complaint, your hearts expand, “Let judgment stern succeed your wise debate! “So shall your fame on lasting record stand, “And injur'd Heav'n appeas'd again shall bless our land!” CXV Thus with indignant air and accents high The Tyrant sought his foul design to cloak, While with extended arms and uprais'd eye He seem'd eternal vengeance to invoke. Silent the Chieftains sat: no murmur broke The deep attention which engag'd each breast, As Richard, with a look which scorn bespoke, And mien compos'd which fortitude express'd, Thus with impressive voice th' assembled Peers address'd. END OF BOOK IV. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. Richard commences his Defence—He states the origin of the Crusade—his league with Philip—his expedition to Messina, and transactions there—his progress to Cyprus— and his conquest of that Island. I ‘Amid th' afflictions of my fate severe, ‘In this my spirit consolation knows, ‘That here, illustrious Princes! I appear. ‘The sport of fate and of insulting foes, ‘Long have I struggled with augmenting woes, ‘And sadly told the melancholy hour. ‘Now on your truth and justice I repose: ‘No more oppression and tyrannic pow'r ‘On innocence oppress'd indignities shall show'r. II ‘Soldier of Christ, when to Judæa's coast ‘With lively faith and confidence I led ‘T' avenge his cause my consecrated host, ‘I look'd for perils and reverses dread. ‘There, while the Saracenic legions fled, ‘The labours of my suff'ring friends I shar'd, ‘With them I triumph'd and with them I bled: ‘When honour call'd, impending fate I dar'd, ‘Nor e'er in adverse hour of Heav'n's support despair'd. III ‘But still, rememb'ring man's condition frail, ‘When most successful, then I chiefly strove, ‘Lest pride o'erweening should my soul assail. ‘Oft as I ponder'd on my Saviour's love, ‘From him I learn'd with constancy to prove ‘Whate'er of ill might on my course await, ‘To bow with def'rence to the Pow'r above, ‘Whose will almighty regulates our fate, ‘And guides with prescience just our variegated state. IV ‘Yet little deem'd I, that misfortune's hand ‘Should e'er so low my dignity reduce, ‘That here debas'd and menac'd I should stand; ‘That thus, with licence wild and foul abuse, ‘Yon recreant tyrant should my worth traduce, ‘Blast my deserts, and vilify my fame! ‘Illustrious Chiefs! a warrior's warmth excuse: ‘Your patience lend, while thus with gen'rous shame ‘The falsehoods of his charge atrocious I proclaim. V ‘With full reply his venom'd speech to meet, ‘I look to your indulgence for support. ‘When with unblushing front he dares repeat ‘Each idle calumny, each vague report, ‘By envy fabricated to distort ‘The glory which he ever fear'd to seek, ‘Needs must I to a chain of facts resort, ‘Which to your hearts will strong conviction speak, ‘Prove his assertions false, his labour'd comments weak. VI ‘Thus then, as suits a Soldier and a King, ‘My plain unvarnish'd story I commence. ‘I need not to your recollection bring, ‘How Saladin, with insolent pretence ‘Of aggravated wrongs and high offence, ‘His barbarous force against Judæa led, ‘Or how, permitted vengeance to dispense, ‘Throughout her coasts he desolation spread, ‘While from his conq'ring arm our Christian warriors fled. VII ‘To Europe soon th' unwelcome rumour came, ‘And now to all the Christian world was known ‘How Saladin had triumph'd in our shame. ‘The plains where Tancred erst had gain'd renown, ‘Where Godfrey fought and Baldwin won a crown, ‘Where pure religion's standard they had plac'd, ‘Yielded to Pagan force: abash'd, o'erthrown, ‘No more the routed bands the victor fac'd, ‘But with disastrous flight their pristine worth disgrac'd. VIII ‘Each gen'rous warrior's heart partook the grief; ‘One spirit seem'd to animate the brave, ‘To suff'ring Palestine to bear relief, ‘Her sad remains from impious sway to save, ‘Or share with her lost sons a common grave. ‘To all who rush'd their efforts to employ, ‘The holy Pontiff absolution gave, ‘And held forth pledges of eternal joy, ‘Wreaths of immortal palm, and bliss without alloy. IX ‘'Twas then, illustrious Chiefs! that Frederick bold, ‘Who both in worth and dignity excell'd, ‘Stood forth his sacred banners to unfold. ‘England my venerable Sire beheld, ‘By pious zeal and feelings high impell'd, ‘Assume the cross and for the war prepare. ‘Nor was the Gallic Monarch then withheld, ‘By those base views which since engross'd his care, ‘The dangers of the sea and of the field to share. X ‘My bosom too the fervid spirit caught: ‘I felt the noble flame; my mounting soul ‘Renown from enterprise and danger sought. ‘Oft as from pomp and crowded courts I stole, ‘O'er my aspiring heart without controul ‘Her sway enthusiastic glory spread: ‘Like the young courser, to th' appointed goal ‘Ardent I look'd; while, by warm fancy bred, ‘Of triumphs yet to come hope flatt'ring visions shed. XI ‘And soon the sacred cross adorn'd my breast: ‘Of hardy warriors an intrepid band ‘To share my fortunes and my perils press'd. ‘I view'd their troops in lengthen'd order stand, ‘Mark'd with delight their martial zeal expand, ‘And gaz'd enraptur'd on their proud array. ‘All was prepar'd, when Heav'n's resistless hand ‘From England's throne my father snatch'd away, ‘And bore his gallant soul to realms of endless day. XII ‘On me devolv'd his state, and all the pains ‘And cares of empire now my thoughts requir'd. ‘From Frontevault, where o'er his mourn'd remains ‘I dropt the tear by filial grief inspir'd, ‘To where my mother, sorrowing and retir'd, ‘Her days had long consum'd in hopeless care, ‘I flew: with rev'rence and affection fir'd ‘Her bonds I broke, and bad her now prepare ‘With me th' imperial rule of Albion's crown to share. XIII ‘Soon as my brows it's orb majestic grac'd, ‘I first fulfill'd the rights which kindred claim'd, ‘And, as their rank became, my brethren plac'd. ‘Fit regents of my kingdom next I nam'd: ‘Then to the point where all my wishes aim'd, ‘Religion's cause, I turn'd my ardent thought. ‘Soon as my gen'rous purpose I proclaim'd, ‘Their tributary aid my Barons brought, ‘And for the distant war with care unceasing wrought. XIV ‘All meaner thoughts their holy zeal disdain'd; ‘More and more full our army daily grew, ‘When, her polluted wings with slaughter stain'd, ‘Her flowing vestments wet with bloody dew, ‘Fame from Cilicia's distant region flew: ‘Her blasting trumpet pierc'd th' attendant gloom: ‘In notes of woe announcing horrors new, ‘Of Frederick's fate she told and hapless doom, ‘Who sunk in Cydnus' stream found there a wat'ry tomb. XV ‘With unavailing tears his fate we mourn'd; ‘But tender sentiment ere long gave place ‘To the strong flame which in our bosoms burn'd. ‘Conscious we felt of merited disgrace, ‘Should we delay th' insulting foe to face, ‘Who now, from Frederick's loss become more bold, ‘Prevail'd the Christian armaments to chase. ‘Each Chief his long-retain'd possessions sold, ‘And his paternal lands in haste exchang'd for gold. XVI ‘The Gallic King, who, ere these tidings came, ‘With watchful pains had preparation made, ‘With me combin'd his purpose to proclaim. ‘In martial pomp his standard he display'd, ‘While many a vassal who his sway obey'd ‘His ardent band from ev'ry quarter drew. ‘On Seine's fair banks, in armour bright array'd, ‘They pass'd in long and terrible review, ‘And form'd presages high of joy and triumphs new. XVII ‘Nor less sincere and sanguine was my hope. ‘Philip I knew, magnificent and brave, ‘By nature fram'd with war's dread front to cope: ‘The pledge of worth which youth's first blossoms gave, ‘Foster'd by early care and counsels grave, ‘And now in manhood's prime to ripeness grown, ‘Bespoke him born Judæa's land to save. ‘I deem'd he well would dignify his throne, ‘And fondly scann'd his truth and ardour by my own. XVIII ‘At Vergelay we met; there, in the sight ‘Of that Great Pow'r our inmost thoughts who knows, ‘Our mutual faith and sacred vows to plight, ‘With common arms the Pagans to oppose, ‘And with united zeal to face our foes. ‘These pious rites accomplish'd, to complete ‘Our meditated enterprise, we chose ‘In two divisions to conduct our fleet, ‘And in Messina's port, where Tancred rul'd, to meet. XIX ‘From fair Provence, by favouring gales impell'd, ‘Our vessels proudly cut the billows green: ‘The heights of Corsica we soon beheld, ‘While more remote, Sardinia's hills were seen. ‘We sought the narrow straights which intervene, ‘And, as on either hand their coasts we view'd, ‘Their promontories vast we steer'd between. ‘Soon far behind we left their summits rude, ‘And tow'rds Sicilia's isle our prosp'rous course pursued. XX ‘Nought for a while we saw but sea and sky: ‘At length, when night's dominion dark prevail'd, ‘And hid th' horizon, flames ascending high ‘Shot thro' the air, and heaven's high arch assail'd: ‘Anon, in clouds and murky darkness veil'd, ‘The lab'ring moon confess'd some potent spell; ‘Of suff'ring spirits who their torments wail'd ‘Groans seem'd to burst, with many a fearful yell ‘Of fiends escap'd from chains of agonizing hell. XXI ‘But soon superior wonders broke around. ‘Thro' the deep gloom uprose with swift ascent ‘A fiery column. With appalling sound ‘Bursting, across the black expanse it sent ‘'Mid light'nings fierce it's horrible content. ‘Myriads of glowing rocks with headlong force ‘Plough'd up the waves and ocean's caverns rent; ‘While from some distant hill, with thunders hoarse, ‘A flaming torrent mark'd it's desolating course. XXII ‘At wary distance on the scene so dread ‘Gazing, the inauspicious isles we pass'd, ‘While still around us fiery show'rs were spread, ‘And Strombolo, from out his caverns vast, ‘With giant force a mass ignited cast. ‘And now, approaching the Sicilian shore, ‘Scylla's dire whirlpool we beheld aghast; ‘Her madd'ning rage the foaming waters tore, ‘While wild Charybdis storm'd re-echoing to her roar. XXIII ‘Between these gulphs our wary pilots steer'd, ‘And soon Messina's walls with turrets crown'd, ‘Superbly rising from the sea, appear'd. ‘The Gallic fleet at anchor there we found. ‘From the high walls and spreading camp around, ‘Shouts of delight our safe arrival hail'd. ‘As from the masts our canvass we unbound, ‘Foregone events we mutually detail'd, ‘And present joy and hope of new success prevail'd. XXIV ‘To you, illustrious Peers! it well is known, ‘That when by Heav'n's decree, in luckless hour, ‘Death snatch'd the royal William from his throne, ‘Th' usurper Tancred seiz'd upon his pow'r, ‘And, to avoid the payment of her dow'r, ‘His widow'd Queen, my sister dear, compell'd ‘To seek a refuge in Palermo's tow'r, ‘Where with attendants few, in durance held, ‘Hardly her feeble force his bold aggression quell'd. XXV ‘The tyrant's base design my presence check'd; ‘My gallant force with trembling awe he view'd, ‘And feign'd to greet my landing with respect. ‘Yet still his schemes perfidious he pursued: ‘While with dissembled rancour he renew'd ‘His proffers insincere, he strove to lead ‘The savage populace by insults rude ‘With England's bands contentions high to breed. ‘Too soon th' usurper found his faithless plan succeed. XXVI ‘Vain would it be and needless to relate ‘The insults, which my suff'ring host sustain'd ‘From Tancred's dark attempt and covert hate. ‘At length provok'd, with fury unrestrain'd ‘They rose in arms: awhile the croud maintain'd ‘Th' unequal fight; but soon, dispers'd and chas'd, ‘They fled, while we Messina's ramparts gain'd. ‘There our victorious standards high we plac'd, ‘By triumphs unforeseen and unsought glory grac'd. XXVII ‘Soon did report the combat's fate proclaim. ‘When Philip, skill'd a double face to wear, ‘To hail my conquest deep dissembling came. ‘He prais'd our warlike skill and puissance rare, ‘And, while he tried with flatt'ring phrase t' ensnare ‘Our unsuspecting hearts, the splendid gain ‘By English prowess earn'd he sought to share. ‘But all his arts and blandishments were vain: ‘Our Chiefs indignant heard, and answer'd with disdain. XXVIII ‘With gen'rous warmth and feelings high inspir'd, ‘They swore untouch'd and sacred to defend ‘The treasures which their valour had acquir'd, ‘'Till Tancred to my just demands should bend. ‘The brave Sabloel I decreed to send, ‘Commission'd with th' usurper false to treat ‘Of past-gone wrongs, and our debate to end: ‘While Philip, anxious still my views to cheat, ‘Burgundia's Duke dispatch'd his labours to defeat. XXIX ‘Vainly to hide these dark attempts he sought; ‘And doubtless fatal our dispute had grown, ‘Had not Sabloel from th' usurper brought ‘Submission, and his suit that what was done ‘I would pass over, and impute alone ‘To popular phrenzy and misguided zeal: ‘My sister's claim he urg'd me to make known, ‘Which, doubly told, he vow'd without appeal ‘To re-imburse, and thus our recent breach to heal. XXX ‘I bad him prove by deeds his fair intent. ‘Forthwith twice twenty thousand marks he paid, ‘And to my camp my widow'd sister sent. ‘When thus the recent ferment was allay'd, ‘Full retribution first I freely made ‘To such as throng'd my clemency to crave; ‘And then the gold, which Tancred had defray'd, ‘Their faithful service to reward, I gave ‘In ample donative to my companions brave. XXXI ‘While Discord thus from our confed'rate host ‘With baffled purpose took her distant flight, ‘In princely order to Sicilia's coast ‘A fleet approach'd. We hail'd the welcome sight, ‘And, hurrying to the strand, with fond delight ‘These arms the mistress of my heart embrac'd. ‘In bloom of youth and pomp of beauty bright ‘Messina's walls my Berengaria grac'd, ‘While Love and Hymen scenes of joy approaching trac'd. XXXII ‘Her from the presence of Navarre's good King, ‘Whose pious cares her mind to worth had train'd, ‘My royal mother had engag'd to bring. ‘Her son to meet all perils she disdain'd: ‘And now, with filial gratitude unfeign'd, ‘To my kind parent I my thanks address'd. ‘Ere long my lovely bride's consent I gain'd, ‘And, as my eager suit I fondly press'd, ‘Her half-retiring charms my raptur'd senses bless'd. XXXIII ‘Now ceas'd to blow the equinoctial gales; ‘Our mariners refresh'd for action burn'd, ‘Their anchors heav'd, and spread their flowing sails. ‘To reach fair England, which her absence mourn'd, ‘All intermediate toils my mother spurn'd: ‘While, their high purpose anxious to conclude, ‘The Gallic legions to the ocean turn'd ‘Their lofty prows; with confidence renew'd ‘Tow'rds Acre's port their course they cheerfully pursued. XXXIV ‘Thus have I told what fortunes here befel. ‘Illustrious Chiefs! on Henry's charge decide: ‘On falsehoods longer I disdain to dwell, ‘But in your honour and known truth confide. ‘Now from Messina's port, in martial pride, ‘Our fleet prepar'd it's progress to resume: ‘In gallant rivalry our warriors vied; ‘Far beam'd each casque, high wav'd each nodding plume ‘And shouts of joy foretold the Pagan's bloody doom. XXXV ‘Twice sixty barks, with martial youth replete, ‘Which each it's Chieftain fam'd in war obey'd, ‘Compos'd our vast and well-appointed fleet. ‘Aloft their varied pennons were array'd, ‘Their oars responsive 'mid the billows play'd, ‘Their prows resplendent shone with burnish'd gold; ‘While in loud notes, more sweet by distance made, ‘The echoing trumpet, and the clarion bold ‘Join'd their harmonious strains, and drums redoubling roll'd. XXXVI ‘But harsh was the reverse, which wayward fate, ‘As if to thwart our expedition bent, ‘On England's puissant fleet decreed t' await. ‘As past the Rhodian coast it proudly went, ‘A southern blast it's dreary caverns rent, ‘And o'er us with ungovern'd fury burst: ‘Their savage aid the mounting billows lent; ‘With deadly force they roll'd and rage accurs'd, ‘And far o'er ocean's face our shatter'd barks dispers'd. XXXVII ‘The sun now set oppress'd by many a cloud: ‘Darkness across the deep her mantle threw, ‘While light'nings pale and thunders hoarse and loud ‘Burst thro' the gloom, and sea fowls madly flew, ‘As if with dread appall'd and terrors new. ‘The storm beyond the course of nature seem'd, ‘Wilder the waves, more horrible their hue; ‘Now sheets of flame, now torrents o'er us stream'd, ‘And vengeful dæmons howl'd, and fiends exulting scream'd. XXXVIII ‘When first the angry tempest round us rag'd, ‘And when the sea, from it's recesses torn, ‘With Heav'n's black cope tremendous warfare wag'd, ‘I left the galley, where my Queen forlorn ‘In silence wept and pray'd for coming morn, ‘And in a light bark, on whose topmast's height ‘A flaming censer blazing far was borne, ‘I sought the means to guide my fleet aright, ‘Amid th' inclement waves and perils of the night. XXXIX ‘Tho' others thus my motions could remark, ‘I of their course could no observance keep. ‘Wrapt in suspense, disconsolate and dark, ‘I plough'd with lab'ring prow the foaming deep; ‘And if, at times, impell'd by billows steep, ‘Some straining bark approaching hail'd us near, ‘The mounting sea rush'd in with sudden sweep, ‘And left us combating it's influence drear, ‘To drive as fortune will'd, a prey to doubt and fear. XL ‘Thus, worn with toil, exhausted and distress'd, ‘We measur'd out the tedious hours of night. ‘When morn approach'd, the tempest sank to rest, ‘The wild waves fell, and o'er th' horizon bright ‘The rising sun disclos'd his cheering light. ‘As 'mid my comrades on the deck I stood, ‘And o'er the wide sea stretch'd my wistful sight, ‘Dispers'd around my scatter'd fleet I view'd, ‘Whose shiver'd masts and sails bespoke their suff'rings rude. XLI ‘Anxious their Sov'reign's standard to rejoin, ‘The Chiefs essay'd my station to explore, ‘And form'd, as chance prescrib'd, a hasty line. ‘Ah! think what pangs my tortur'd bosom tore, ‘When the proud galley which my consort bore, ‘And those which bold Dubois, and Harcourt brave, ‘And valiant Turnham held, I saw no more. ‘As heaving still roll'd on each foaming wave, ‘To me it seem'd t' announce their inauspicious grave. XLII ‘Two days pass'd on with progress sad and slow; ‘And tho' fond fancy, 'midst our heart-felt pain, ‘Visions of flatt'ring hope would sometimes shew, ‘And strive o'er grief ascendency to gain, ‘Still unsubdued the tyrant held her reign. ‘When the third morn with new-born splendour glow'd, ‘A bark was seen, which o'er the distant main ‘It's spreading sails aloft appear'd to croud, ‘While with incessant strokes it's oars the ocean plough'd. XLIII ‘A branching palm with imitative shade ‘O'er-canopied it's prow, while high in air ‘It's flag the bearings of Dubois display'd. ‘Watchful we mark'd the crew with sed'lous care ‘Their quicken'd progress tow'rds my vessel bear, ‘While their brave Chief their vig'rous efforts press'd. ‘Now to my deck he hasten'd to repair, ‘And, with a look which inward pain confess'd, ‘Me eager to receive his tidings thus address'd. XLIV “From proud Limazzo and the Cyprian coast “I come, great King! ill tidings to unfold. “When late the storm dispers'd your shatter'd host, “And howling winds, and waves which madly roll'd, “Forbad your fleet it's destin'd course to hold, “O'er the wild sea as fate prescrib'd we drove: “The tempest's rage our destiny controul'd; “With the fierce elements in vain we strove, “While billows yawn'd beneath, and thunders roll'd above. XLV “Soon as the night's dark shadows were dispell'd, “And morn's first tints proclaim'd approaching day, “A rugged shore far-stretching we beheld, “Where rocks, high tow'ring with their summits grey, “The foaming billows lash'd with ruthless sway. “As rose the sun, before us on the strand “We saw two vessels which dismasted lay: “Part of their suff'ring crews had reach'd the land, “While some the roaring surf still struggled to withstand. XLVI “With painful sympathy awhile we gaz'd; “But soon the waves our lab'ring vessel caught, “And, as aloft their threat'ning heads they rais'd, “They seem'd with instant death and ruin fraught. “Undaunted yet, our stern direct we brought “To meet the mounting sea which broke around, “And with such firmness and success we wrought, “That, thro' the rocks on ev'ry side which frown'd “Passing, within the port at length we refuge found. XLVII “To aid our suff'ring friends we now repair'd: “To Harcourt first we needful succour gave, “Brave Turnham next, who his misfortunes shar'd, “My zealous crew contributed to save “From ocean's fury and a briny grave. “Of those, who crouded round the vessels wreck'd, “Food and protection we essay'd to crave: “Tho' fierce their looks, and savage their aspect, “They seem'd by pity mov'd our miseries to respect. XLVIII “While thus on shore we sought to rest awhile, “With hasten'd steps some to Limazzo went, “Where Isaac dwelt, the tyrant of the isle. “Urg'd by the hope of gain, with foul intent “A ruffian band of plunderers he sent. “As we beheld them pouring o'er the plain, “On deeds of rapine and destruction bent, “Anxious we sought some safe retreat to gain, “Where our exhausted troop their station might maintain. XLIX “Not far from where my vessel I had moor'd, “An antient castle stood: on every side “It's walls a rock precipitous secur'd, “And with rough front hostility defied. “Thither with rapid course our Chieftains hied; “While with my comrades I again essay'd, “As fav'ring now appear'd the wind and tide, “To gain my bark: our canvass we display'd, “And soon the ready helm the pilot's hand obey'd. L “Nor useless did our timely caution prove. “Scarce had we left th' inhospitable strand, “When the base herd, whom hope of plunder drove, “Seiz'd on our shatter'd barks with felon hand. “Their prey secur'd, with many a flaming brand “Amid the sails and timbers fire they spread; “While near them we beheld the Tyrant stand, “Who urg'd them to complete their purpose dread, “And with incitements strong their impious fury fed. LI “Flush'd with success, and fir'd by hope of prey, “He now advanc'd the castle to assail, “And on the walls his engines 'gan to play, “When, gently wafted by the southern gale, “Across the waves appear'd a distant sail, “Which seem'd approaching fast the treach'rous isle. “Himself of this expected prize t' avail, “The Tyrant bad his savage troops awhile “Forego their rude attack, and intermit their toil. LII “Ere long, advancing nearer to the shore, “The royal standard waving high we view'd, “And hail'd the bark which Berengaria bore. “It's tatter'd sails the tempest's fury shew'd, “While unsuspicious still the crew pursued “To false Limazzo's port their eager way. “Thither the tyrant led his caitiffs rude, “Prepar'd by force the lovely Queen to stay, “Should vain his efforts prove her caution to betray. LIII “With careful heed his progress I remark'd. “Soon as the purpose of his march I guess'd, “In a light skiff I instantly embark'd, “And to the Queen my rapid course address'd. “As her departure earnestly I press'd, “An Envoy from the subtle Tyrant came, “Who in smooth terms imparted his request, “That, trusting to his hospitable fame, “She on his isle would land, and needful succour claim. LIV “Aware of what th' insidious Prince design'd, “With phrase becoming, and in courteous guise, “The Queen his proffer full of guile declin'd, “But for her bark and crew requir'd supplies, “Which for their wants immediate might suffice. “Meantime we sought the outward port to gain, “Lest Isaac, tempted by the glorious prize, “And finding his perfidious proffers vain, “Might try by impious force our Sov'reign to detain. LV “With diligence we therefore sought the coast, “Where on it's craggy rock the castle rose, “Whose friendly walls contain'd our shipwreck'd host, “By the fierce islanders beleaguer'd close. “There, while secure from our perfidious foes “The Queen, fatigued by toils, preferr'd to stay, “Fearful of what the Tyrant might propose, “I deem'd it best, great Prince! without delay “To seek your fleet, and prompt intelligence convey.” LVI ‘As thus Dubois with eager accents spoke, ‘My heart beat high with rage, and thro' the croud, ‘Who felt for England's wounded glory, broke ‘Indignant shouts and acclamations loud. “Comrades!” I cried, “against th' usurper proud “The force resistless of your vengeance bear! “If e'er your hearts with martial ardour glow'd, “To aid my gen'rous enterprize prepare! “Let ev'ry warrior haste his Monarch's cause to share!” LVII ‘Scarce had I ended, when each Chieftain brave ‘The impulse felt, and forth his weapon drew, ‘The Tyrant to chastise, his Queen to save. ‘Low bending on their oars, th' obedient crew ‘Plough'd the green waves and o'er their surface flew. ‘When the bright sun had reach'd the midway sky, ‘And the bold hills of Cyprus met our view, ‘They seem'd with freshen'd zeal their strokes to ply, ‘And thro' their ranks arose an animating cry. LVIII ‘Nor fruitless prov'd their ardour: we pursued ‘Our course, 'till near Limazzo's rocky coast ‘The wish'd-for galley of my Queen I view'd. ‘'Till now, by cares of more import engross'd, ‘I had not notic'd that of all my host ‘One bark alone with mine had kept it's course, ‘Which brave Mauleon led: far interpos'd ‘Between us and our tempest-stricken force, ‘Now seen no more, the sea maintain'd a wide divorce. LIX ‘Of this my gallant band took little heed: ‘Still on the royal bark their eye they kept, ‘And, now approaching, with augmented speed ‘And force renew'd the foaming waves they swept. ‘Impatient on the galley's deck I leap'd, ‘And, as my arms embrac'd my lovely bride, ‘With mingled extacy and grief she wept, ‘And told of perils on the ocean wide, ‘And dangers threat'ning yet from gloomy Isaac's pride. LX ‘As when, in April's changeful month, a show'r ‘Softly descending cheers the thirsty plain, ‘Exhausted nature owns its genial pow'r, ‘And, as around him sprouts the various grain, ‘Expected harvests greet the thankful swain: ‘So, when the tears from Berengaria fell, ‘My heart their influence own'd; with high disdain ‘And kindling wrath I felt my bosom swell, ‘And love and honour call'd th' usurper base to quell. LXI ‘But, as unequal seem'd my weaken'd force, ‘I deem'd it best, ere yet to arms we came, ‘To mild persuasion first to have recourse. ‘I therefore sent Blondel, who in my name ‘Might urge the tyrant to redeem his shame ‘By restitution to our plunder'd crews: ‘But if, of justice negligent and fame, ‘To grant my suit he proudly should refuse, ‘I threaten'd on his isle my vengeance to unloose. LXII ‘Prepar'd alike for peace or war we stood, ‘When from the shore return'd, Blondel thus spoke. “Fierce is the tyrant, and his language rude: “As if disdaining his designs to cloak, “And as if anxious vengeance to provoke, “He warn'd me thence, and, with insulting air, “Threaten'd to bring your host beneath his yoke: “Tell your young King, he cried, my troops prepare “Fit greeting, if to land his puny force he dare!” LXIII “'Tis well,” I cried; “since thus he braves his fate, “The warfare that he threatens let us wage! “Of gentler means no longer hold debate: “The die is cast; of conquest I presage; “Our cause is just, and from th' usurper's rage “No English spirit can derive alarm, “Or with superior numbers fear t' engage. “In Berengaria's cause, brave Chieftains arm! “Beauty with honour joins your gen'rous souls to warm!” LXIV ‘As thus I spoke, the Chiefs my ardour caught, ‘And hastily their preparations made, ‘As if with more than human valour fraught. ‘Nor slight the peril: in the port were laid ‘Five stately gallies martially array'd, ‘And mann'd with crews inur'd to naval fight: ‘While on the shore, drawn up in long parade, ‘Appear'd the tyrant's guards, whose armour bright ‘Glitter'd with burnish'd gold and shot reflected light. LXV ‘Himself we saw: far beaming on his head ‘A casque he wore, while o'er his cuirass wide ‘The shaggy trophy of a wolf was spread; ‘His faulchion's room an iron mace supplied, ‘Studded with spikes, which oft with barb'rous pride ‘He rear'd on high; a courser he bestrode ‘Of size surpassing, whose ensanguin'd side ‘He ceas'd not with his rowel sharp to goad, ‘As thro' the lengthen'd ranks imperiously he rode. LXVI ‘Meantime we seiz'd some boats, which on the strand ‘Unguarded lay; in these a chosen crew ‘I plac'd, and gave Mauleon the command. ‘These, high in courage tho' in numbers few, ‘I bad their vig'rous course to shore pursue, ‘And boldly with th' usurper battle join, ‘Ere from delay his force more num'rous grew; ‘While I my movements might with their's combine, ‘To cover their descent and aid their bold design. LXVII ‘Scarce had they on this enterprise embark'd, ‘When from the harbour, where the gallies lay, ‘The Cypriot Chiefs their destination marked. ‘In numbers bold, they doubted not to stay ‘Their purpos'd course, and, as an easy prey, ‘Before the Tyrant to conduct them bound. ‘With confidence advancing in array, ‘While high arose the trumpet's martial sound, ‘On ev'ry side they spread their ample force around. LXVIII ‘Soon as th' unequal conflict I descried, ‘For quick attack I instant order gave: “Now,” cried I, “shall your English worth be tried! “Heedless of peril, let us rush to save “From danger imminent our comrades brave;” ‘Nor more—intent their gen'rous zeal to prove, ‘Our vig'rous crews cut thro' the yielding wave, ‘And with redoubling emulation strove, ‘'Till in the adverse barks our well-arm'd prows they drove: LXIX ‘My galley with the Cypriot Chief engag'd: ‘And now, our grapplings fix'd, and clinging close, ‘With mutual hate we dubious warfare wag'd. ‘While from each bark a cloud of arrows rose, ‘And rival warriors, struggling to oppose ‘The rude attack, the tide of carnage swell'd, ‘I leap'd undaunted 'mid the crouded foes. ‘This when Blondel and Reginald beheld, ‘Their swords o'er heaps of slain a passage free impell'd. LXX ‘Now English valour found an ample field: ‘For soon against their foes my crew prevail'd, ‘And drove them the contested post to yield. ‘Mounting the deck, their King they loudly hail'd, ‘And with resistless energy assail'd ‘The adverse host. Nought could withstand their force, ‘Nor helm their strokes sustain'd, nor cuirass mail'd; ‘Around us lay full many a breathless corse, ‘While others found a grave beneath the billows hoarse. LXXI ‘My vengeful arm the Cypriot Chief had felt: ‘And now the small remainder of their crew ‘Submissively for grace and pardon knelt. ‘Granting their boon, we cast around our view, ‘And saw the English flag which proudly flew ‘On board the galley which Dubois engag'd, ‘In sign of conquest and of triumph new: ‘While with three vessels Lacy combat wag'd, ‘Who join'd in rude attack with fury unassuag'd. LXXII ‘Thither our course with eager haste we turn'd: ‘To aid his suff'ring friends with equal zeal ‘Dubois advanc'd. With transport we discern'd, ‘Where'er brave Lacy rais'd his fatal steel, ‘The hostile ranks in wild confusion reel: ‘Nor with less valour did his gallant band ‘Their leader's brave example seem to feel; ‘As if success hung on his single hand, ‘Each warrior forward press'd th' assailants to withstand. LXXIII ‘By turns the adverse hosts the barrier pass'd, ‘And from the vessel's sides, where rag'd the fight, ‘Full many a gallant combatant was cast, ‘And sank beneath the foaming waves in night. ‘Forthwith my bark, advancing on the right, ‘It's hostile prow against one vessel drove, ‘While on the left, Dubois, with strenuous might ‘Another grappling, forc'd it to remove, ‘And fairly match'd with him more equal war to prove. LXXIV ‘Ere long, the party which oppos'd my course, ‘Compell'd by hard necessity, gave way, ‘And, like a torrent, whose resistless force ‘O'ercharg'd with wintry rains no mounds can stay, ‘We burst in fierce and terrible array. ‘Now conquest our successful efforts crown'd: ‘The vanquish'd host confess'd our pow'rful sway: ‘While their imploring hands in chains we bound, ‘With acclamations loud we made the air resound. LXXV ‘Dubois, who quickly our success perceiv'd, ‘His efforts now redoubling, thro' the foe ‘A bloody passage to their deck atchiev'd. ‘When as we saw the Cypriot flag drawn low, ‘We felt our breasts with treble ardour glow, ‘And, onward rushing, to brave Lacy's aid ‘A pow'rful succour we prevail'd to throw. ‘Thro' the opposing band our way we made, ‘And on the vanquish'd bark our standard broad display'd. LXXVI ‘The gallant Lacy on the deck we found: ‘With conquest flush'd, by glorious toil untir'd, ‘And grac'd with many an honourable wound, ‘For further action still his soul aspir'd. ‘The vet'ran's gen'rous ardour we admir'd; ‘But to Mauleon now our thoughts we turn'd, ‘Whose peril imminent our aid requir'd. ‘Close by the shore his party we discern'd, ‘Which onward press'd as if the tyrant's force it spurn'd: LXXVII “Comrades!” I cried, “well has your warlike skill “Thus far prevail'd to check the tyrant's hand. “It now remains fresh duties to fulfil: “Behold Mauleon and his valiant band, “Who, reckless of the forces which withstand “Their bold attempt, press onward to the fight, “And seek in danger's front the hostile strand. “Chieftains! your country's cause demands your might, “Let England and Saint George your gen'rous zeal incite.” LXXVIII ‘Rous'd by my pow'rful call, across the main ‘With vigour fresh my crew their course pursued, ‘And swept the sea the Cyprian shore to gain. ‘Soon, near at hand, the bloody scene we view'd. ‘As bold Mauleon 'mid the conflict rude, ‘His high command with calm composure gave, ‘I felt my soul with ardour new endued. “Thus, thus,” I cried, “all perils let us brave!” ‘And plunging from the deck I buffetted the wave. LXXIX ‘Deep in the foaming element I sank, ‘By cuirass steel'd and weighty arms impell'd, ‘And largely of the briny flood I drank: ‘Yet still the water's whelming force I quell'd, ‘And thro' the billows which above me swell'd ‘With vig'rous arm and dauntless heart I broke. ‘Rising above them, I Blondel beheld, ‘Who, true to me and friendship, dar'd provoke ‘The madd'ning ocean's rage and fate's impending stroke. LXXX ‘His welcome voice my stagg'ring senses cheer'd, ‘His hand my frame o'erspent with toil sustain'd: ‘Tow'rds brave Mauleon's host our course we steer'd, ‘Which now, 'mid clouds of darts the shore had gain'd, ‘And doubtful strife 'gainst countless foes maintain'd. ‘With doubled energy the waves we beat, ‘'Till to the strand we came by slaughter stain'd, ‘Where, driven by force superior to retreat, ‘Th' intrepid Chieftain stood and brav'd the combat's heat. LXXXI ‘Thus, when on Lebanon a tempest hoarse ‘With furious blast assails the forest's pride, ‘The sturdy cedar bends before it's force, ‘Yet soon resumes it's state, extending wide ‘It's spreading arms which ages have defied. ‘With transport fir'd, the vet'ran Chief we hail'd, ‘And with our sturdy faulchions at his side ‘To check the savage islanders prevail'd, ‘Who bold from numbers still his gallant band assail'd. LXXXII ‘While yet their host presumptuous onward press'd, ‘And urg'd with freshen'd zeal th' unequal fight, ‘Thus with loud voice my comrades I address'd: “Think, gen'rous warriors, of your pristine might! “At glory's potent call let every knight “Follow his King, and crush th' insulting foe!” ‘I said—and brandishing my weapon bright ‘At an opposing Chief I aim'd a blow, ‘Which cleav'd his burnish'd casque, and instant laid him low. LXXXIII ‘As when amongst a herd of tim'rous deer ‘A lion rushes, from his puissance dread ‘They fly dispers'd, their speed increas'd by fear; ‘So, where around our weapons terror spread, ‘The adverse combatants disbanding sled. ‘More fiercely still we urg'd their quicken'd course, ‘Thro' bloody torrents, and o'er heaps of dead; ‘While groans and shrieks, and exclamations hoarse, ‘In chorus dire proclaim'd our desolating force. LXXXIV ‘Meantime, bold Harcourt from his craggy height ‘Beheld the fortune of the field revers'd, ‘And urg'd his band to share the perilous fight. ‘Forth from his castle furiously he burst: ‘His sword the adverse combatants dispers'd, ‘And hew'd his glorious way my force to join. ‘Nor less in deeds of knightly prowess vers'd, ‘Brave Turnham strove his efforts to combine, ‘And, emulous of fame, broke thro' the Cypriot line. LXXXV ‘Now blaz'd with tenfold rage our martial heat; ‘Now, to our val'rous efforts forc'd to yield, ‘The vanquish'd foe more quickly 'gan retreat, ‘Relinquishing the wide ensanguin'd field, ‘When, fiercely grasping his enormous shield, ‘And waving high in air with menace proud ‘His mace with spikes o'ercharg'd and doubly steel'd, ‘The Tyrant forward rode: he check'd the croud, ‘And thus with mad'ning wrath inflam'd he cried aloud. LXXXVI “Oh lost to honour, loyalty and fame! “Ye worse than coward females, to disgrace “By flight ignoble your forefathers' name! “Dread ye yon remnant of an host to face, “That thus like sheep your trembling course ye trace? “Turn! or from me expect the death ye fly! “Your King, alone, without your succour base, “Dares on his own intrinsic worth rely, “Nor needs your aid to snatch the palm of victory!” LXXXVII ‘His potent threats the fugitives recall'd, ‘Who, gath'ring round him, pale and doubtful stood, ‘On either hand with present fear appall'd. ‘When still he found our fortune we pursued, ‘And saw his legions shun the contest rude, ‘He spurr'd his vig'rous steed, and, like a wave ‘Whose giant mass o'ertops the circling flood, ‘Onward he rush'd, the chance of war to brave, ‘And, negligent of life, his fame and crown to save. LXXXVIII ‘His gen'rous courser bore him to the coast, ‘With fetlocks deep in blood of Cypriots dyed. ‘When as he saw the small but daring host, ‘Whose matchless valour had his arms defied, ‘High swell'd his bosom with indignant pride. “Are these the foe who mock our pow'rful sway? “Can these our warlike force oppose?” he cried, “Thus of their lives the forfeit shall they pay, “And on their limbs shall wolves and hungry vultures prey!” LXXXIX ‘He said, and aim'd at me his murd'rous mace. ‘On my uplifted shield with iron bound ‘And hides well-stretch'd the sturdy blow took place. ‘I felt it's mighty force my sense confound, ‘While he, again his weapon whirling round, ‘Prepar'd to strike. I caught th' occasion brief, ‘And on his sinewy thigh infix'd a wound. ‘Now with redoubled fury rag'd the Chief, ‘His eye-balls glar'd, and groans confess'd his inward grief. XC ‘Again his pond'rous mace on high he heav'd, ‘And struck with fell intent, but struck in vain: ‘Harmless it fell, on my broad shield receiv'd. ‘But now my trusty sword his courser's mane ‘And neck deep-piercing, mad with sudden pain ‘He rear'd, he plung'd, and o'er the valley swept ‘As if disdainful of his barbed rein. ‘No longer now his seat the Tyrant kept: ‘With vengeance fir'd to earth indignantly he leap'd. XCI ‘Undaunted still he sought his willing foe, ‘His strength entire, his fury still unspent. ‘Now match'd more equally, full many a blow ‘On either helm right manfully we lent, ‘While, on our combat fearfully intent, ‘Each adverse host in mute amazement stood. ‘We struck, we parried, rising now, now bent, ‘And steadily maintain'd th' encounter rude, ‘Hot with the glorious toil, our armour stain'd with blood. XCII ‘At length the Tyrant aim'd a furious stroke, ‘Which, on my shield descending, thro' the hide ‘And solid frame with steel surmounted broke. ‘I cast the fragments o'er the champaign wide, ‘And with my biting faulchion's edge replied, ‘Ere from the blow he could his mace regain. ‘The trenchant blade pervaded deep his side; ‘A crimson flood forth-bursting dyed the plain, ‘Stagg'ring he fell, and writh'd with agonizing pain. XCIII ‘I leap'd upon him as he prostrate lay, ‘And bad him, if he life or safety sought, ‘To yield himself to my superior sway. ‘But neither threats nor risk he heeded ought: ‘No more his senses, all astounded, wrought, ‘But his wan cheeks, and once commanding brow ‘The saffron hue of death appear'd t'have caught. ‘As vanquish'd thus and faint I view'd my foe, ‘I felt my melting heart with pity's impulse glow. XCIV “Bear him,” I cried, “from off th' ensanguin'd field, “Bind up his wounds, and give him present aid!” ‘Forthwith, out-stretch'd on his capacious shield, ‘Him bleeding still th' obedient warriors laid, ‘And to my bark across the strand convey'd. ‘The Cypriot host, in wild confusion spread, ‘Still more by Isaac's hapless doom dismay'd, ‘To shun impending vengeance trembling fled, ‘Abandoning their arms, as chance or fortune led. XCV ‘To proud Limazzo's walls their steps we chas'd, ‘Where, anxious to escape their threaten'd fate, ‘Th' affrighted fugitives repair'd in haste. ‘At their approach the warders op'd the gate; ‘But, 'mid the narrow port, with fierce debate ‘Close throng'd they stood, unable to proceed, ‘While those without, afraid our force t'await, ‘Press'd on with clamours rude and fatal speed, ‘Which serv'd but fresh alarm and contests new to breed. XCVI ‘Close at their heels we urg'd th' astonish'd crew, ‘Who now despairing, fled on either hand. ‘Their host dispers'd we stopp'd not to pursue, ‘But suffer'd them unnotic'd to disband, ‘While to attempt the gate I gave command. ‘My comrades bold with vig'rous onset rush'd; ‘And soon, for none their fury could withstand, ‘With hopes of fame and glorious conquest flush'd, ‘The thickly crouded mass with force resistless crush'd. XCVII ‘In vain the warders tried the gates to close: ‘Without, within, a phalanx close appear'd, ‘Alike intent their efforts to oppose. ‘While friend and foe thus equally they fear'd ‘With fresh assault our arms a passage clear'd. ‘Shouts of exulting transport rent the air, ‘As on the rampart we our banner rear'd, ‘T'invite our friends our triumphs new to share, ‘By valour well redeem'd from anguish and despair. XCVIII ‘Straightway descending from their barks we saw ‘Our ready mariners, and at their head ‘Dubois employ'd his host in line to draw. ‘Onward he march'd, while by the hand he led ‘My Berengaria, who with fearful tread ‘And trembling limbs across the plain advanc'd, ‘Yet strew'd with slain and still with carnage red: ‘Doubtful and sad around her eyes she glanc'd, ‘Now to soft pity mov'd, by terror now entranc'd. XCIX ‘Ill did her soul with such dread scenes accord: ‘Her gentle spirit, while the victor's hand ‘Scatter'd dismay, the stern behest abhorr'd, ‘Which made him thus humanity withstand. ‘But soon as, quitting the terrific strand, ‘I fondly bad her in Limazzo rest, ‘She felt her heart with new delight expand; ‘Smiling she clasp'd me to her panting breast, ‘And overpaid my toils, by love and beauty bless'd. END OF BOOK V. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. Richard continues his defence—he states the capture of Chariclæa, daughter of the Emperor Isaac—his interview and reconciliation with her father—his progress to Palestine —his engagement with a Saracenic vessel—and his arrival and first transactions at Acre. I ‘Soon as the morning gleam'd with radiance new, ‘Forth from the walls his band Mauleon led, ‘The vanquish'd host of Cypriots to pursue. ‘With ease he trac'd them wheresoe'er they fled; ‘For dismal were the vestiges, and dread, ‘Which mark'd their fatal course across the plain. ‘The ways were strew'd with corses of the dead, ‘And bleeding warriors, who, convuls'd with pain, ‘Rent Heav'n with fruitless cries, and sought relief in vain. II ‘While tow'rds Nicosia he his march impell'd, ‘Our well-appointed fleet, too long detain'd, ‘Before Limazzo anchor'd we beheld. ‘No longer now by want of force restrain'd, ‘I urg'd the gen'rous Chiefs, who much complain'd ‘That fate forbad them our renown to share, ‘T'attempt the glorious toils which yet remain'd. ‘My mandate they obey'd: with instant care ‘And emulating zeal they 'gan for war prepare. III ‘Against Candaria, whose commanding height ‘O'er-aw'd the northern plain, and mock'd it's foes, ‘The valiant Tancarville led forth his might. ‘Chermias, which on the west embattled rose, ‘With leaguer to surround bold Granville chose. ‘Here, as we learn'd, the Tyrant stern had plac'd ‘His lovely daughter in seclusion close, ‘Who, tho' with youth and charms superior grac'd, ‘Her tedious hours was forc'd in solitude to waste. IV ‘'Gainst Famagusta, which the eastern coast ‘Sublimely guarded, Leicester's puissant Chief ‘And brave Fierte march'd their pow'rful host. ‘Here, when old Teucer chid his comrades grief, ‘And bad them chase with wine their sorrows brief, ‘As exil'd 'cross th' Ægean gulph they sail'd, ‘The friendly port afforded them relief: ‘No more his home relinquish'd he bewail'd, ‘A second Salamis by Heav'n approv'd he hail'd. V ‘Success their various enterprises crown'd. ‘In every quarter of the vanquish'd isle ‘Wealth long amass'd our joyful warriors found, ‘To deck their triumphs and reward their toil. ‘But these contemptible they held and vile, ‘Compar'd to her, who from the Chermian tower ‘Granville exulting led. Her temper'd smile ‘And eyes yet glist'ning with a briny shower, ‘Won every heart to own fair Chariclæa's power. VI ‘Scarce nineteen summers had their circuit made, ‘Since Heav'n to Cyprus gave this jewel rare. ‘Celestial sweetness o'er her features play'd, ‘And, 'mid the tresses of her auburn hair, ‘Love spread his toils beholders to ensnare. ‘Her eyes bespoke the candour of her soul; ‘While her commanding mien, her graceful air, ‘And modest blushes o'er the senses stole, ‘Inspir'd respect, and held the heart in soft controul. VII ‘When Granville first his beauteous captive brought, ‘With courteous bearing, to the cool retreat, ‘Where with my Berengaria I had sought ‘A refuge from the noon-day's sultry heat, ‘Her gentle heart with conscious feelings beat. ‘The fast-receding blood her cheeks forsook, ‘Fearful she seem'd our keen regards to meet, ‘But gazing with an half-averted look, ‘Her tender limbs with awe and apprehension shook. VIII ‘As I remark'd the workings of her breast, ‘And how with terror indignation strove, ‘Thus courteously the Princess I address'd. “No more let anxious doubts your spirit move: “From English valour still shall beauty prove “The kind attentions which may grief assuage. “For us tho' fortune wreaths triumphant wove, “No warfare we with lovely females wage: “We own their sway supreme, and in their cause engage.” IX ‘Her agitation though my words appeas'd, ‘Still o'er her varying cheek soft blushes crept, ‘And spoke the terror which her soul had seiz'd. ‘My gentle Queen, who silence yet had kept, ‘Now rising, tow'rds the sorrowing maiden stept, ‘And kindly strove her anguish to disarm. “Lady!” she cried, as still the suff'rer wept, “Let no uneasy thoughts thy fears alarm: “No rude invader here my lovely charge shall harm. X “No more the days which youth consigns to joy “Lost to the world in solitude consume: “Those precious hours more worthily employ. “No harsh injunctions now thy beauties doom, “Unknown and unadmir'd, to waste their bloom: “Henceforth be free, to better hopes awake! “Again, sweet maid, thy winning smiles assume! “Exert thyself for Berengaria's sake, “And as my friend with me of happiness partake.” XI ‘The royal maiden, as adown her cheek ‘The tear by gratitude excited fell, ‘With falt'ring accents thus essay'd to speak. “In vain, great Queen! of coming joys you tell: “In vain you strive my sorrows to dispel. “What joys, alas! can my sad bosom know, “On what gay scenes of pleasure can I dwell, “When, stripp'd of empire and condemn'd to woe, “My father's hours in grief and cruel suff'rings flow! XII “Ah! if sincerely you of comfort speak, “For his relief exert your sov'reign sway; “Console his woes, his cruel bondage break. “Then, wheresoe'er our fate may point the way, “Resign'd I'll follow, and it's laws obey: “My watchful cares his waning life shall smooth, “Cheer his distresses, and his pains allay; “Content to dedicate to him my youth, “To share his fortunes hard, his wounded soul to sooth.” XIII ‘She said, and sank on Berengaria's breast. ‘I shar'd the feelings of my lovely bride, ‘Which soft compassion and regret express'd, ‘And thus with cheerfulness assum'd replied. “When beauty sues, her boon is ne'er denied. “Your wish your father's freedom shall atchieve, “By rashness forfeited and barbarous pride. “Let him from you the precious gift receive: “A pious daughter's worth his errors shall retrieve.” XIV ‘I ceas'd, and gave Blondel an earnest charge ‘To hasten to the fleet, and from duress ‘The captive Monarch straightway to enlarge. ‘The Princess strove her feelings to confess, ‘And look'd the thanks her tongue could ill express, ‘While from her eyes again fond tears burst forth: ‘Yet still her spirit struggled with distress, ‘As if endow'd with sense of conscious worth, ‘From innate powers deriv'd and dignity of birth. XV ‘To sooth her anguish Berengaria tried, ‘And, while she present resignation taught, ‘The balm of hope with tenderness applied. ‘And now fresh strength th' afflicted maid had caught, ‘When from the fleet Blondel returning brought ‘Her father still in chains of silver bound. ‘Her looks impatiently the Monarch sought, ‘Who, feeble yet and languid from his wound, ‘As slowly he advanc'd with indignation frown'd. XVI ‘Soon as the hall he reach'd, with anxious speed ‘Fair Chariclæa flew to his embrace: ‘With ready hands his limbs from bonds she freed, ‘And gaz'd with smiles enraptur'd on his face. ‘He, still resentful of his late disgrace, ‘In sullen silence met her speaking glance: ‘His eye, dark scowling, yet appear'd to trace ‘The deep remembrance of his foul mischance, ‘Which seem'd his lofty soul to hold in speechless trance. XVII ‘His stern regard appall'd the blushing maid, ‘Who, not unmindful of his pride untam'd, ‘Stood trembling, of his violence afraid. ‘After a pause, she tenderly exclaim'd, “Let not, oh Sire! my duteous care be blam'd; “Look on your daughter, who from England's King “Sought your release: fortune perhaps has fram'd “Approaching joy, time may new comforts bring, “And blisses unforeseen from present woe may spring.” XVIII “Talk not to me,” replied the gloomy Chief, “Of joys which Heav'n forbids my soul to know, “Nor mock with expectations vain my grief. “For me no more the source of bliss shall flow, “But, thro' a lengthen'd perspective of woe, “Despair and horror on my path shall wait. “I spurn the mercies of a taunting foe! “Tho' stripp'd of empire and pursued by fate, “Still shall remembrance live and register my hate.” XIX ‘This said, he seem'd as if by rage impell'd ‘The gentle pleader from his sight to drive, ‘Who kneeling at his feet his garment held. ‘Pain'd by the scene, and anxious to revive ‘Some hope which yet might consolation give, “Prince!” I exclaim'd, “against resistless doom “It ill becomes heroic worth to strive: “'Midst winter's storms we look for summer's bloom, “When nature, freed from chains, her splendour may resume. XX “So, when her murky veil misfortune spreads, “Heav'n works unseen our blessings to renew, “And joys unhop'd-for o'er our dark course sheds. “Still shall my courtesy your hate pursue, “Still will I strive your rancour to subdue “By gentle bearing and demeanour fair. “For England's King, to knightly prowess true, “When hostile bands no more his vengeance dare, “From sorrow's wound delights the rankling shaft to tear.” XXI ‘With that his half-reluctant hand I caught. ‘His eyes, which varying passions spoke, he rais'd, ‘And, as if lost in agitating thought, ‘Awhile in silence on my face he gaz'd. ‘At length he cried, “Could memory be eras'd, “Could I forget, that, fall'n from Cyprus' throne, “I stand before thee humbled and disgrac'd, “My feeling breast thy courtesy might own, “And thankfully receive the favours thou hast shewn. XXII “But recollections still too strongly wake; “Nor can I yet the state from which I fell “From my torn mind on thy injunction shake. “No more attempt my anguish to dispel! “My wounded soul on grief delights to dwell: “Corroding sorrows there their empire hold, “And vengeful furies, hot from deepest hell, “There rear their snakes, their scourges dire unfold, “And agonize my heart with vengeance uncontroul'd.” XXIII ‘He ceas'd, and sought his eyes suffus'd to cloak. ‘Still in our ears his horrid accents rung, ‘And terror strange in every breast awoke, ‘When, sudden, round the maid his arms he slung, ‘And on her neck in speechless anguish hung: ‘Then starting cried, as her fair form he view'd, “Oh Chariclæa! to reverses young! “Oh hapless victim! must misfortune rude “In thy fall'n parent's fate thy innocence include? XXIV “Say, can thy strength oppose affliction's tide? “Canst thou the world's proud contumely bear? “Or is thy soul with constancy supplied “To meet the ills which coming years may share? “May'st thou forget, to save thee from despair, “What blessings fortune once for thee combin'd, “Nor what thou art with what thou wast compare! “Ah! may'st thou, to the past and future blind, “In apathy secure, to mis'ry be resign'd!” XXV ‘His further utterance flowing tears denied. ‘Fair Chariclæa bow'd with due respect, ‘And thus in accents dignified replied. “Tho' heav'nly justice may our faults correct, “It's fost'ring hand will innocence protect. “Unconscious of imputed crime, my soul “Can on the past with confidence reflect, “And trusts that Heav'n will still my fate controul, “And in it's mercy deign my suff'rings to console. XXVI “Cease then, my father, for your child to grieve, “Nor let ideal woes your bosom rend. “If humbly we it's chastisement receive, “Heav'n to our hearts it's healing balm will send, “And with it's dispensations mercy blend. “Already, safe from violence your child “In England's Queen has found a gentle friend, “Whose kind compassion and attentions mild “Have to the stroke of fate my feelings reconcil'd.” XXVII ‘She said, and smiling with angelic grace ‘She caught my Berengaria to her breast, ‘And fondly held her in a close embrace, ‘While she the maiden tenderly caress'd, ‘And the warm feelings of her heart express'd. ‘Isaac intently gaz'd. The passions high ‘Which rack'd his soul his varying cheek confess'd; ‘His rugged brow relax'd, he heav'd a sigh, ‘And sympathetic drops stood quiv'ring in his eye. XXVIII “Nature!” he cried, “thy pow'rful sway I own! “The passing dream which held my stubborn mind, “Thanks to my daughter's constancy, is flown. “Oh Chariclæa lov'd! like thee resign'd, “Tho' galling chains these vanquish'd limbs may bind, “Tho' sad and painful may my moments flow “From social commerce and mankind confin'd, “Thy dear remembrance shall relieve my woe, “And, taught by thee, my soul shall consolation know.” XXIX “Think not,” I cried, “that such shall be thy fate. “The gen'rous souls of Englishmen disdain “To urge beyond the battle's proof their hate. “We scorn to shew our pow'r by giving pain. “No galling fetters shall thy limbs restrain, “No insults shall thy feeling bosom rend. “Prince! if in Palestine renown to gain “Thy heart incites thee, as my honour'd friend “I call thee in our cause thy puissant aid to lend. XXX “Then, when the glorious enterprise we share, “When honour's call united we obey, “Be this our contest, this our only care, “On Acre's towers our banners to display, “Through unbelieving hosts to hew our way, “And still associate danger's front to prove: “While Berengaria fondly shall essay, “By every art which anguish can remove, “Thy daughter to protect with all a mother's love.” XXXI “Right nobly hast thou said,” the Prince replied: “I feel thy worth sublime, and think with shame “Of my own faults and over-weening pride. “My gratitude thy knightly proffers claim; “Henceforward let renown my breast inflame, “Let thy example bright my valour fire “Beneath thy banners to atchieve fair fame, “To chivalry's neglected meed aspire, “And worthily fulfil what honour's laws require.” XXXII ‘He said, and caught me in his out-spread arms. ‘The lovely Chariclæa smiling gaz'd, ‘And beam'd resplendently with blushing charms, ‘As with pure vows tow'rds Heav'n her hands she rais'd. ‘Now to the hall our willing steps we trac'd, ‘Where by my lovely bride the royal maid ‘And her brave Sire respectfully I plac'd. ‘To lasting friendship we oblations made, ‘Nor rose, till night had wrapt th' horizon wide in shade. XXXIII ‘Here, Princes! for a moment deign to pause, ‘And mark the statements fraudful and untrue, ‘With which yon Tyrant props his worthless cause. ‘Those English knights, whom 'mongst ye now I view, ‘Partook my toils, and Isaac's treasons knew. ‘Let them declare if I have ought mistold: ‘If not, with confidence and def'rence due ‘Permit me, Chiefs! in conscious virtue bold, ‘My false oppressor's wrongs yet further to unfold. XXXIV ‘Now were again our pennons high display'd: ‘From Famagusta, where in order due ‘And princely state our gallies were array'd, ‘Once more we sought our progress to renew. ‘Quickly across the green expanse we flew: ‘Sidon we pass'd, by fav'ring gales impell'd; ‘Scandalion's lofty tow'rs next met our view, ‘And soon proud Acre's ramparts we beheld, ‘Where rag'd the fiend of war unsated and unquell'd. XXXV ‘Those high-deserving Peers, whose gen'rous zeal ‘Led them on Palestine's ensanguin'd plain ‘To vindicate by arms the Christian weal, ‘It would but ill become me to detain, ‘By repetitions or descriptions vain ‘Of Acre's vaunted strength and ramparts high. ‘When of her tow'rs no vestige shall remain, ‘The deeds there wrought shall lofty themes supply, ‘To grace th' heroic page and charm posterity. XXXVI ‘If Priam's fate, and once imperial Troy, ‘Now known no more, or only known to fame, ‘Immortal Homer's numbers could employ; ‘If deathless verse could consecrate it's name, ‘And bear Achilles' worth and Helen's shame ‘Beyond the ravage of consuming time: ‘Our Christian warriors future bards may claim, ‘Whose grateful suffrage and approving rhime ‘Their triumphs may record with energy sublime. XXXVII ‘'Though envy now our well-earn'd wreaths may blast, ‘'Though foul detraction may our worth obscure, ‘And o'er our deeds her veil envenom'd cast, ‘The Muse's voice shall our renown secure, ‘And valour's meed for ages shall endure. ‘Oh thought transporting! heroes yet unborn ‘The sacred song to virtue shall allure, ‘Shall lead them pleasure's flow'ry paths to scorn, ‘And with unfading praise their mem'ry shall adorn! XXXVIII ‘When from the bonds, in which disastrous fate ‘Had long the vanquish'd potentate detain'd, ‘Victim of Pagan insolence and hate, ‘His freedom royal Lusignan regain'd, ‘Far from Jerusalem, where once he reign'd, ‘A refuge safe in Tripoli he sought; ‘There for awhile securely he remain'd, ‘His bosom torn with agonizing thought, ‘And recollections dire with grief and horror fraught. XXXIX ‘Thither with zeal fraternal Godfrey led ‘From Europe's distant clime a valiant host: ‘Thro' Greece and Syria soon his influence spread, ‘And many a chieftain flock'd to Judah's coast, ‘Prompted to check th' insulting victor's boast, ‘And to the suff'ring King to furnish aid. ‘Their force united soon a band compos'd, ‘Which cheerfully Lusignan's voice obey'd, ‘And for approaching war their preparations made. XL ‘As when, at morn's fresh call, the busy swarm ‘Forth issuing haste their labours to renew, ‘Where'er the sun extends his influence warm ‘The eager race their various tasks pursue, ‘And taste the flow'ry sweets yet moist with dew: ‘So throng'd the warriors of the Christian name, ‘When dauntless at religion's call they flew, ‘Their suff'ring brethren to redeem from shame, ‘To aid their weaken'd cause, and prop their tott'ring fame. XLI ‘Recruited thus, the valiant Chiefs disdain'd ‘In inactivity their hours to waste: ‘The heights of Acre rapidly they gain'd, ‘Their engines dire of war in order plac'd, ‘Spread their wide camp, and far their leaguer trac'd. ‘From his high tow'rs bold Caracos survey'd ‘Their host, as onward they advanc'd in haste: ‘And, as he fitting preparations made, ‘Heard their loud cries and mark'd their numbers undismay'd. XLII ‘Full worthily he held the great command. ‘His watchful care, ere Saladin yet reign'd ‘Or yet had stretch'd his rule o'er Egypt's land, ‘To deeds of hardihood the hero train'd. ‘Him, when the reins of empire he had gain'd, ‘The grateful monarch as his surest guide ‘And closest in his confidence retain'd, ‘And now o'er Acre and it's region wide, ‘Won by his puissant arm, he nam'd him to preside. XLIII ‘Twelve thousand chosen troops his rule obey'd, ‘Whom monster-breeding Africa had sent, ‘With varied arms and barbarous pomp array'd, ‘From every quarter of her wide extent. ‘There their tough bows the swarthy Nubians bent, ‘The swift Numidians rush'd their swords to wield, ‘With those whom Nile within his streams had pent, ‘And those, who rov'd o'er parch'd Augela's field, ‘And whom in deserts rude wild Barca had conceal'd. XLIV ‘Such were the bands which Acre's towers contain'd, ‘To war familiar, and now doubly bold ‘From all the recent triumphs they had gain'd. ‘Lusignan's force superior numbers told: ‘As his brave Chiefs their banners proud unroll'd, ‘Twice thirteen thousand warriors grac'd their line. ‘Thuringia's lord the multitude controul'd, ‘By gen'ral suff'rage chosen to combine ‘Their congregated force, and lead their great design. XLV ‘While thus the Christian host their leaguer held, ‘And strove more closely still the town t'invest, ‘Their fierce assaults bold Caracos repell'd; ‘And, tho' by long-continued toils distress'd, ‘Tho' by the dread of Famine's scourge impress'd, ‘Whose dire approach his army's zeal unnerv'd, ‘He yet prevail'd their ardour to arrest: ‘Right steadily his charge the Chief preserv'd, ‘Nor ceas'd his gen'rous toils, nor from his duty swerv'd. XLVI ‘Yet fate appear'd his efforts to oppose: ‘For now the meagre Fiend, with Death combin'd, ‘Pour'd on his band her desolating woes: ‘Weak and emaciated the warrior pin'd, ‘His faulchion dropp'd, his weighty shield resign'd; ‘From the high ramparts which the fortress crown'd, ‘The languid Chieftains, on their spears inclin'd, ‘Cast many a fond and anxious look around, ‘But no expected aid, no consolation found. XLVII ‘At length, his desp'rate fortunes as he scann'd, ‘And conscious that his now exhausted host ‘No more the Christian puissance could withstand, ‘To yield the town and abdicate the coast ‘With deep reluctance Caracos dispos'd. ‘Commission'd brave Thuringia's lord to greet, ‘A Herald hasten'd to the Landgrave's post, ‘And proffer'd the surrender to complete, ‘Were liberty secur'd, and life, and safe retreat. XLVIII ‘Oh! that of war's vicissitudes aware, ‘And less by visionary hopes abus'd, ‘The Chief had granted these conditions fair! ‘Oh! that by views fantastic unseduc'd ‘The smiles of fortune he had wisely us'd! ‘But, from the foe's distress presumptuous grown, ‘With arrogance all treaty he refus'd, ‘And vow'd, depending on his force alone, ‘On heaps of Pagans slain to plant Lusignan's throne. XLIX ‘Now rag'd the war with aggravated hate: ‘Each day the fortunes of the foe grew worse, ‘And Caracos, urg'd on by menac'd fate ‘His high command more strictly to inforce, ‘In desperation found his sole resource. ‘But vain his utmost efforts would have prov'd, ‘If, thither bending rapidly his course, ‘Great Saladin, to aid his friend belov'd, ‘Had not tow'rd Acre's walls his host tremendous mov'd. L ‘As, when the sun in fiery Cancer reigns, ‘The Nile, green-mantling, half-exhausted, flows, ‘And gasping Egypt mourns her arid plains; ‘Soon as the torrents charg'd with melted snows ‘Swell the glad stream, and far their slime depose, ‘Plenty and joy her laughing fields adorn, ‘Nature with vigour renovated glows, ‘And fruitful Ceres from her copious horn ‘Scatters her gifts profuse, and gilds the waving corn: LI ‘So, to the bands 'mid Acre's ramparts pent ‘Their puissant King's approach propitious seem'd. ‘As o'er the hills their anxious glance they bent, ‘A long-drawn line of helms and cors'lets gleam'd, ‘As if prolific earth with warriors teem'd, ‘And Cadmus till'd again his Theban field. ‘Heedless of want, of triumphs now they dream'd: ‘With force renew'd each Chieftain brac'd his shield, ‘And sought with hand infirm his trusty sword to wield. LII ‘On Turo's heights encamp'd the welcome host, ‘And from it's summit stretch'd-in order due, ‘'Till in the plain it's sloping sides were lost. ‘Not Xerxes, when he led his motley crew ‘In barb'rous pomp, such multitudes could shew, ‘As here the banners of their tribes unroll'd, ‘And girt the mountain with their long review. ‘The Persian Prince their numbers might have told, ‘But vain the effort now to count the warriors bold. LIII ‘Amid the leaders, first in rank and name ‘Miralis brave his standard proud display'd: ‘Him, his first born, already known to fame, ‘O'er Egypt's realm the King had ruler made. ‘Melcalez next, who those rich districts sway'd ‘Where rapid Tigris rolls his princely course, ‘And whom the blest Arabia's coast obey'd, ‘Careless alike of pity and remorse, ‘Led to the camp his vast and far-collected force. LIV ‘Next Safadin, the brother of the King, ‘From Syria, where his wide command he held, ‘Hasten'd his splendid armament to bring. ‘With him fierce Tecadin his march impell'd: ‘The stoutest Chiefs of Persia he excell'd, ‘And 'gainst the holy cross with ceaseless rage ‘And hate exhaustless his rude bosom swell'd: ‘He vow'd exterminating war to wage, ‘And with Lusignan's blood his fury to assuage. LV ‘From Turcomania and Curdistan's bound ‘Bellegemin his hardy vet'rans brought. ‘There too Falkedin, royal youth, was found, ‘Whom Saladin the use of arms had taught, ‘And who in Mauritania's clime had sought ‘The swarthy bowmen who his rule confess'd. ‘The general impulse bold Corazin caught: ‘As his quick course from Ascalon he press'd, ‘High beat with vengeful hopes his enterprising breast. LVI ‘With these Caÿsac from Armenia's plain ‘To aid the cause his num'rous legions led: ‘There bold Kahadim brought his warlike train, ‘Whose cruel sway and domination dread ‘O'er Galilee and Cœlosyria spread: ‘There too the fierce Bedreddin was descried; ‘To him, 'mid wild Arabia's deserts bred, ‘The King had giv'n o'er Judah to preside, ‘And on his martial skill with confidence relied. LVII ‘While thus from Africa and Asia swarm'd ‘The varied bands, and on the lengthen'd height ‘Of Turo and of Mahumeria form'd, ‘Beyond the plain, which on the left and right ‘Spread it's wide surface fit for open fight, ‘And gently trended to the sea-girt coast, ‘The Christian chieftains had encamp'd their might, ‘To each allotted his appointed post, ‘And in well-order'd rank their armament dispos'd. LVIII ‘Lusignan on the north his legions plac'd, ‘And many a gallant knight and warrior brave ‘The royal standard of the Red Cross grac'd. ‘De Vescy's banners there were seen to wave, ‘Who, fill'd with zeal Judæa's realm to save, ‘Had left Burgundia's hills with vineyards crown'd: ‘There too, no more in Garonne's stream to lave ‘His manly limbs, Pontiniac bold was found, ‘Not less for valour's meed than courtesy renown'd. LIX ‘With Montmirail advanc'd the fam'd Des Barres; ‘Them from their youth fair Picardy had rear'd ‘And friendship's bonds united them in war. ‘Near them the ensigns of Des Brennes appear'd, ‘With those of hoary Glanville, long rever'd ‘As England's legal arbiter and guide: ‘Unus'd to conflicts rude, soon as he heard ‘The sacred call, he cast his robes aside, ‘And clad in iron mail the Pagan wrath defied. LX ‘Nor less with rev'rence for the cause inspir'd ‘Did holy Baldwin there his prowess shew. ‘When Henry first with gen'rous pity fir'd ‘Conven'd his bands to face th' insulting foe, ‘He felt his heart with pious ardour glow; ‘His patriarchal duties he resign'd, ‘And turn'd tow'rds Palestine his footsteps slow, ‘Trusting on that blest shore a grave to find, ‘Where his great Master erst aton'd for all mankind. LXI ‘St. Waleric there was seen, a puissant peer, ‘Of high descent and antient Norman race; ‘Sacey, whose heart ne'er felt ignoble fear, ‘And many a valiant Chief, who sought to grace ‘The sacred enterprise and death to face. ‘These all concurr'd brave Godfrey to respect, ‘Who, fill'd with ardour glory's path to trace, ‘And Judah's throne from ruin to protect, ‘Aspir'd on Acre's walls his standard to erect. LXII ‘Near these, but ranging further to the west, ‘Their glitt'ring front the Pisan troops display'd, ‘Who young Vervoni's lib'ral sway confess'd: ‘And next, the host which Sforza's voice obey'd, ‘Close to the sea their wide encampment made. ‘Far from their native plains, for them no more ‘Lombardia smil'd, no more, beneath her shade, ‘Tranquil they cull'd benignant nature's store: ‘Rous'd by religion's call they sought the hostile shore. LXIII ‘Where on the east tow'rd Acre's walls incline ‘The Mahumerian heights, the German band ‘In deep array drew up their puissant line. ‘Thuringia's banners there were seen t'expand; ‘Who, urg'd by glory, from their distant land ‘Had led the champions of the Christian name, ‘In climes remote, and on a foreign strand, ‘To reap the harvest of immortal fame, ‘And Judah's suff'ring realm to vindicate from shame. LXIV ‘In snowy robes which half their mails conceal'd, ‘On which the sanguine cross was proudly shewn, ‘Their war-tried ranks the Templars bold reveal'd. ‘With them, not less to glory's records known ‘For deeds of worth and honour bravely won, ‘The Hospitallers dar'd the Pagan fight: ‘O'er their cuirasses, which resplendent shone, ‘Their coats of arms they wore of scarlet bright, ‘Emblem of holy zeal, adorn'd with crosses white. LXV ‘Next to their post his station Conrad held, ‘Where bold Musardo o'er the ocean frown'd, ‘And with his craggy front the tide repell'd. ‘Encamp'd with him the valiant Danes were found. ‘The leaguer wide their force associate bound, ‘Which tow'rds the land was now completely clos'd; ‘While num'rous gallies, far dispers'd around, ‘With vigilance unceasing watch'd the coast, ‘Left succours might arrive for famish'd Acre's host. LXVI ‘But fortune now deceiv'd their sage intent. ‘Wafted by fav'ring breezes, to the shore ‘A potent fleet it's course commanding bent, ‘Which Saladin's imperial standard bore. ‘Thirty huge gallies, laden deep with store ‘Of corn and wine from Egypt's rich domain, ‘Into the town prepar'd relief to pour. ‘Our weaker armament essay'd in vain ‘By many a stout attempt their progress to restrain. LXVII ‘Discomfited, and forc'd to quit the coast, ‘Our fleet retir'd, while from the crouded wall ‘A gen'ral shout proclaim'd the victor's boast. ‘No longer hunger's agonizing call ‘Prevail'd their stricken senses to appal; ‘No more, when close the Christian squadrons press'd, ‘They fear'd by want ingloriously to fall: ‘Plenty again their fainting Chieftains bless'd, ‘And hopes till now unknown cheer'd every warrior's breast. LXVIII ‘Nor baseless prov'd the visions they had form'd. ‘While from their ramparts, flush'd with sudden joy ‘And ardour new, tumultuously they swarm'd, ‘While, their besiegers eager to annoy, ‘Their camp to pillage, and their works destroy, ‘They strove with rancour and revenge unquell'd, ‘Stern Saladin ne'er ceas'd his force t'employ. ‘Now in their turns, in leaguer closely held, ‘By two opposing hosts the Christians were impell'd. LXIX ‘So in the seas which Africa embrace, ‘When hosts of finny tyrants thro' the deep ‘The persecuted Exocætus chase; ‘His course aërial should he try to keep, ‘And o'er the waves with moisten'd wing to sweep, ‘Unnumber'd birds of prey his flight await: ‘Pois'd in the air, or plung'd 'mid billows steep, ‘Where'er he turns he meets impending fate, ‘And nature's doubled gifts augmented risk create. LXX ‘Whate'er distress from war's alarms could spring, ‘Whate'er of torment, want and ceaseless care ‘To pang the soldier's gallant heart could bring, ‘The bold Crusading host was doom'd to bear. ‘The sad recital willingly I spare ‘Of all the horrors which they long sustain'd, ‘When famine rear'd her scourge, and black despair ‘Throughout their camp with sway remorseless reign'd, ‘And the last dregs of woe from misery's chalice drain'd. LXXI ‘But the great Pow'r from mortal ken conceal'd, ‘Which thus the web of agony had weav'd, ‘Pitying at length, their suff'ring spirits heal'd. ‘Guess their delight, when, from suspense reliev'd, ‘From hunger's fangs and ling'ring death repriev'd, ‘Within their port the long-expected aid, ‘Promis'd by Europe's Princes, they receiv'd; ‘When Austria's Duke his banner there display'd, ‘And there the well-stor'd fleet of Philip was array'd! LXXII ‘While thus on Acre's field the strengthen'd host ‘Their contest with the Pagan force renew'd, ‘From Cyprus tow'rds Judæa's blood-stain'd coast ‘With ardent hope my progress I pursued. ‘Now near at hand appear'd her mountains rude, ‘When, from the north approaching to the shore, ‘A lordly vessel, arm'd for war, I view'd, ‘Which Saladin's imperial ensigns bore, ‘And o'er the yielding waves it's course majestic wore. LXXIII ‘As, 'mid the humbler tenants of the plain, ‘Some venerable oak is seen to rise, ‘His giant limbs the winter's storms disdain, ‘The whirlwind's rage his ample bulk defies, ‘And o'er his head the blast innoxious flies: ‘So, with our lesser vessels when compar'd, ‘Tremendous seem'd this moving castle's size, ‘Which nought for barks so disproportion'd car'd, ‘But held it's way as if our hostile force it dar'd. LXXIV ‘While we amaz'd its force immense survey'd, ‘Lo! from the port approaching to our fleet, ‘A well-mann'd galley it's swift progress made. ‘With vig'rous strokes her oars the billows beat, ‘And plough'd the deep our armament to meet. ‘When near at hand, thus loudly cried the Chief: “Your presence, mighty Prince! I come to greet, “Whose welcome aid ensures our quick relief “From aggravated woes and long-protracted grief.” LXXV ‘Then, leaping on the deck, “I come,” he cried, “A boon from brave Lusignan to implore. “Yon stately vessel, which with barbarous pride “And streamers gay is hast'ning tow'rds the shore, “From Baruth comes, deep charg'd with copious store “Of arms and darts for the beleaguer'd band. “These it awaits a moment fit to pour “Into the town, when, as their Chief has plann'd, “Our host shall be compell'd his forces to withstand. LXXVI “Of twice six hundred troops consists their host, “Who, to perform their plighted vow intent, “Now, in their Monarch's presence, seek the coast, “To reinforce their friends in Acre pent. “On you, great Prince! by Heav'n propitious sent, “Lusignan and his Peers reliance place: “They trust that, on renown and glory bent, “Your zeal the glad occasion will embrace “To meet th' insulting soe, and England's standard grace.” LXXVII “Friend of my youth, and brother erst in arms! “Renown'd Du Mirle!” I cried, “the great design “With hope of fame my panting bosom warms! “Thy boon is granted: hasten to rejoin “Judæa's King: tell him, tho' fiends combine “With Pagan force their purpose to attain, “Mine the attempt shall be, the conquest mine; “That England's flag shall still triumphant reign, “And English valour still controul the hostile main!” LXXVIII ‘As thus I ended, my companions brave ‘Impatient stood, expecting my behest: ‘Each sought pre-eminence of risk to crave, ‘And ev'ry eye, and ev'ry look confess'd ‘The ardour kindling in each warrior's breast. ‘Well pleas'd I mark'd the general influence spread, ‘And thus, while gently I their zeal repress'd, ‘Their gen'rous zeal from sense of honour bred, ‘And strove by temper'd phrase to calm their minds, I said. LXXIX “When on your valour, oft in perils shewn, “And now arous'd to action, I reflect, “Your equal claims to enterprise I own. “Yet, tho' each bold associate I respect, “Impartial judgment must my choice direct, “And sound discretion regulate my will, “Such of my valiant Chieftains to select, “As, from experience past and naval skill, “Seem the impending task most fitted to fulfil. LXXX “Be thine, renown'd Dubois! the chief command, “The great attempt let Clare and Caunville aid, “And Talebor lead on his gallant band. “Oft 'mid surrounding dangers undismay'd “Your manly fortitude has been display'd: “Mark now, how all along yon mountain steep, “And yon high rampart martially array'd, “Our crouded foes their anxious stations keep! “Mark! and by deeds of worth immortal glory reap!” LXXXI ‘I said. The Chiefs, exulting in my choice, ‘Repair'd their bold atchievement to pursue, ‘And, mindful of their Monarch's cheering voice, ‘With doubled energy inspir'd each crew. ‘No breath of wind o'er ocean's surface blew, ‘No friendly gale the yielding canvass swell'd, ‘While 'cross the still'd expanse the gallies flew, ‘By vig'rous arms and lusty oars impell'd, ‘And sought the ship which yet it's haughty station held. LXXXII ‘Across the waves as sturdily they swept, ‘Stretch'd in a line appear'd each vessel's prow; ‘So evenly their order'd rank they kept. ‘But Talebor, who when he sought a foe ‘Thought ev'ry intervening minute slow, ‘Swift as a dart by hand unerring lanc'd, ‘Or feather'd arrow shot from Tartar's bow, ‘Before the rest intrepidly advanc'd, ‘While o'er the deep his bark pre-eminently glanc'd. LXXXIII ‘Still press'd he forward, 'till, approaching close, ‘He reach'd the ship, which, like some mountain vast, ‘With front tremendous from the water rose. ‘As with swift stroke beneath it's stern he pass'd, ‘The crew, who stood in crouded order class'd, ‘Mocking his bold attempt, with deadly hate ‘Enormous stones and massive jav'lins cast. ‘But neither present ills nor threat'ning fate ‘Could his firm heart appal, or English zeal abate. LXXXIV ‘Onward he rush'd, and, 'gainst her side sublime ‘His bark impelling, up the dread ascent ‘He bad his mariners essay to climb. ‘Obedient to his voice, with bold intent, ‘A shower of darts upon her deck they sent, ‘Then, bravely mounting, each with succ'ring hand ‘To aid his stagg'ring friend assistance lent: ‘Daring at once the Saracenic band, ‘And the deep wat'ry grave which seem'd below t'expand. LXXXV ‘Alike tremendous both! alike contemn'd! ‘But ah! alike destructive of his host! ‘Of some their felon darts the progress stemm'd, ‘While some, their slipp'ry hold and footing lost, ‘Fell headlong: wide the treach'rous deep expos'd ‘It's yawning gulphs the warriors to receive, ‘Then o'er their cold remains for ever clos'd. ‘Blest shades! for you shall mem'ry trophies weave, ‘And sacred be the waves which o'er your corses heave! LXXXVI ‘But toils nor risk the heroes could appal: ‘Heedless of fate they urg'd their desp'rate quest, ‘Resolv'd to vanquish or aveng'd to fall. ‘Brave Talebor I saw: before the rest ‘Mounting the deck, the Pagan crew he press'd, ‘And wild dismay and horror thro' them spread: ‘In honour'd death I saw him bow his crest; ‘Amid his comrades, who around him bled, ‘To Heav'n's eternal joys his gallant spirit fled. LXXXVII ‘We view'd the scene with rage and sorrow fill'd, ‘While down each woe-struck Chieftain's pallid cheek ‘A flood of tears unconsciously distill'd. ‘When grief at length permitted me to speak, “Whate'er may chance,” I cried, “no feelings weak “Ought now our noble ardour to restrain! “Let us the foe with force united seek, “For our lost friends a great revenge obtain, “And offer to their shades a sacrifice of slain!” LXXXVIII ‘As thus I spoke, the trumpet signal gave. ‘Rous'd by th' inspiring sound, my eager crew, ‘Urg'd their redoubled strokes: across the wave ‘Swift as the wind my bounding galley flew. ‘Five more besides my own, in order due ‘Their course maintaining, sought the vessel's side, ‘And with loud shouts the foe's attention drew, ‘While, by a circuit more diffuse and wide, ‘Six other potent barks I bad Mauleon guide. LXXXIX ‘As now more nearly we approach'd the foe, ‘Checking our speed their force immense we view'd. ‘On every hand close-throng'd, above, below, ‘Arm'd for the fight th' insulting Pagans stood, ‘And wav'd their swords yet red with Christian blood: ‘Unnumber'd warlike engines rang'd we saw, ‘With jav'lins charg'd and rocky fragments rude, ‘While archers stout their bows prepar'd to draw, “And rais'd horrific cries and yells our souls to awe. XC ‘And souls less constant well might they have scar'd: ‘But all their shew and arrogant parade ‘My comrades bold, who oft had perils dar'd, ‘With indignation and contempt survey'd; ‘And, hot for action, earnestly they pray'd ‘Permission to chastise the vaunting band. ‘Hardly my voice their wild impatience stay'd, ‘'Till I perceiv'd Mauleon near at hand, ‘And ready to fulfil the project I had plann'd. XCI ‘Soon as in equal rank, on either side, ‘Fronting the adverse ship our squadrons lay, ‘Thus to my eager friends I loudly cried: “No longer now your great intent delay! “Amply the debt of vengeance now repay, “Which to yon boastful Saracens you owe! “Ply well your oars, nor from your efforts stay, “'Till, deeply pierc'd by each invading prow, “No more it's threat'ning front yon tow'ring bark shall shew.” XCII ‘Throughout my host a shout of transport broke: ‘My gallant comrades, on their oars inclin'd, ‘Swept o'er the foaming waves with vig'rous stroke; ‘And, swifter than the unimprison'd wind, ‘Mauleon's band with us their course combin'd. ‘Conscious of our design, the Pagan crew, ‘Who ev'ry quarter of their high deck lin'd, ‘Their weighty jav'lins cast, their long bows drew, ‘And from their engines huge a show'r o'erwhelming threw. XCIII ‘Nor ineffectual did their efforts prove. ‘On Drogo's bark, who held by me his rank, ‘A rock descending thro' it's timbers drove, ‘And split in twain the deck: from either bank ‘The warriors cast beneath the billows sank. ‘Rising they struggled with the circling wave, ‘And caught each floating oar and shiver'd plank, ‘Which from the horrors of a briny grave ‘Might their exhausted frames o'echarg'd with armour save. XCIV ‘A harsher fate betided brave Martel. ‘As he his post intrepidly maintain'd, ‘A pond'rous jav'lin on his cuirass fell, ‘And pierc'd his breast: the gushing blood distain'd ‘His rich surcoat; life's current quickly drain'd; ‘A mist opaque obscur'd his waning sight, ‘And o'er his frame convuls'd death sternly reign'd: ‘His manly spirit, prov'd in many a fight, ‘And honour'd in his fall, took it's eternal flight. XCV ‘The Pagans rais'd a loud exulting cry. ‘But brief their triumph: to their vessel's side ‘Our well rang'd gallies, now approaching nigh, ‘So forcibly their iron prows applied, ‘That 'mid her broken timbers, gaping wide, ‘With crash tremendous entrances were made, ‘Thro' which impetuous rush'd the foaming tide. ‘No more our foes their arrogance display'd, ‘But desperation seem'd their bosoms to pervade. XCVI ‘As thro' their mighty bark's capacious hold ‘They heard the waters rush with fearful sound, ‘A sudden terror seiz'd each warrior bold. ‘Hopeless of aid they glanc'd their eyes around, ‘And, while their cries the dire invader drown'd ‘And tore between the decks, they stood aghast. ‘All safety sought, but none a refuge found: ‘Some with convulsive gripe embrac'd the mast, ‘And some amid the waves themselves despairing cast. XCVII ‘These fate severe continued to pursue: ‘My watchful crew awaited their descent, ‘And with such aim their bows unerring drew, ‘That many a warrior bold to death they sent; ‘While others, by their fruitless labour spent, ‘And by oppressing armour downward weigh'd, ‘To ocean's shadowy caves exhausted went. ‘Without success to save them I essay'd, ‘For ill my comrades' rage compassion's voice obey'd. XCVIII ‘But soon our wond'ring faculties were call'd ‘To mark a scene more exquisite of woe: ‘Our souls it's dread sublimity appall'd; ‘We wept the victims, and forgot the foe. ‘For now the waters, rising from below, ‘Fore-runners of inevitable doom, ‘O'er the wide deck in torrents 'gan to flow: ‘The shrieking warriors, wrapt in tenfold gloom, ‘Beneath the billows found their inauspicious tomb. XCIX ‘Low sank the vessel in th' o'erwhelming deep: ‘Awhile the masts appear'd, on whose dread height ‘A wretched remnant sought their hold to keep; ‘These, with a grasp from desperation tight, ‘The cordage caught, and, stiffen'd with affright, ‘Rent Heav'n with cries: soon 'mid the billows cold ‘Ingulph'd they vanish'd from our aching sight. ‘Far round the agitated whirlpool roll'd, ‘Foaming and black it rag'd with fury uncontroul'd. C ‘My victor band, as on the wreck they gaz'd ‘And mark'd the sinking foe, of triumph high ‘And mad delight a shout exulting rais'd: ‘Thro' all the fleet, with loud and glad reply, ‘Clamours of transport strove with our's to vie; ‘While from the Christian camp and crouded coast, ‘In wild but solemn chorus, rose a cry, ‘At once expressive of their joyful boast, ‘And striking deep dismay throughout the Pagan host. CI ‘While thus applause our feelings high enhanc'd, ‘For conquest well atchiev'd, our puissant fleet ‘Tow'rds Acre's walls in seemly pomp advanc'd. ‘Unnumber'd Chiefs rush'd on with eager feet, ‘And lin'd the shores our wish'd approach to greet; ‘While on the ramparts wide, and mountain's brow, ‘Where baffled Saladin had fix'd his seat, ‘In mute dejection stood th' astonish'd foe, ‘Their faculties absorb'd in agonizing woe. CII ‘And now our prows triumphant touch'd the strand. ‘As from the bark I leap'd, with earnest haste ‘Lusignan forward press'd and caught my hand: ‘Awhile in silence he my neck embrac'd, ‘Then cried, “Oh Prince! by Heav'n benignant grac'd, “Welcome, thrice welcome to Judæa's shore! “Her glories long by Pagan wrath defac'd, “Her fanes polluted by her children's gore, “Her suff'rings and her shame she now shall weep no more. CIII “Thou com'st the friends, who long my weaken'd throne “Have gallantly supported, to relieve: “To thee for aid they look, from thee alone “They hope effectual succour to receive. “Oh! may thy arms our glories lost retrieve! “May they from further wrongs, from Pagan sway, “These sacred and insulted shores reprieve! “And may'st thou, like the gen'rous orb of day, “Our path perplex'd and dark illumine with thy ray. CIV “The moment is at hand, when Gallia's Prince, “In whom our confidence is well repos'd, “Prepares his zeal and prowess to evince. “Ere yet your armament had reach'd our coast, “Against the forces in the town inclos'd “Our Chiefs, with gen'ral suffrage, had decreed “That Philip should conduct his puissant host. “Still let him on his enterprise proceed, “And may all-gracious Heav'n his steps to victory lead! CV “Whate'er Judæa's Monarch may propose “By me shall be obey'd,” I straight replied; “My will shall ever with his wishes close. “His potent legions oft in perils tried “Against the Pagan force let Philip guide: “May their attack with full success be crown'd! “Yet trust I that, whatever may betide, “When danger calls, my comrades may be found “Not less prepar'd for war, nor less in arms renown'd.” CVI ‘I spoke; and thus, with a contemptuous smile, ‘The Gallic King rejoin'd; “If right I ween, “Th' event your fond expectance will beguile. “What Gallia's sons can do is yet unseen; “In onset bold, in danger's front serene, “Unaw'd, uncheck'd, they honour's path pursue, “Nor ineffectual fall their sabres keen: “Careless of life, and to their sov'reign true, “Their fortitude unmatch'd admiring worlds may view. CVII “Richard, farewell! your needless toils to spare, “And to insure renown, I hasten hence. “And you, companions brave! who hope to share “My glorious harvest, now your task commence. “Mark how yon tow'rs, the ramparts wide which fence, “In horrid state and threat'ning grandeur rise: “Soon as his genial splendour to dispense “To-morrow's sun shall gild the eastern skies, “His all-transcendent beams shall light us to our prize.” CVIII ‘He said, and tow'rds the camp his footsteps bent. ‘The wond'ring Chieftains now aloud express'd ‘The painful feelings and strong discontent, ‘With which his arrogance had fir'd each breast. ‘But soon the rising tumult was suppres'd, ‘When, forward moving, and with out-stretch'd hand, ‘Judæa's King and Nobles I address'd: “While Philip hastens to his warlike band, “Duties of high import our present thoughts demand. CIX “The sacred Cross, which as an emblem pure “Of holy faith and constancy we wear, “Reminds us that, Heavn'n's mercies to procure, “Our hearts should still a strong remembrance bear “Of Him who knows to punish and to spare. “It much behoves us, ere repose we seek, “Before His altar to address our prayer, “With ardent vows and supplication meek “His pardon to implore, His favour to bespeak. CX “Our thanks we owe, that o'er the stormy deep “He deign'd the foaming billows to compose, “That he permitted us our course to keep, “And bear our succour 'gainst the Pagan foes. “Nor should we less implore His name for those, “Who in His sacred cause so bravely strove, “And now as martyrs, blest in death, repose; “That endless joy and transport they may prove, “And join th' angelic choir of harmony and love.” CXI “Oh Prince!” Lusignan cried, “well pleas'd I hear “The pious dictates of thy grateful heart. “He who fears GOD can know no other fear. “To him the battle's front, the foeman's dart, “Present no terrors, and no dread impart; “Conscious of aid surpassing human pow'r, “At menac'd ills his soul disdains to start; “Tho' thunders break around and tempests lour, “Thrice arm'd his fate he meets, and braves the threat'ning hour. CXII “Let us together kneel, together bow: “Let all our host in grateful homage join “To that great Pow'r who gave us thee to know. “In our rude camp no gilded temples shine, “No vaulted roofs our hymns of praise confine, “No white-rob'd priests in splendid state attend, “No pealing organs breathe their notes divine: “Our vows with nature's purest incense blend, “And with the mounting gale to Heav'n's high throne ascend.” CXIII ‘As thus he spake, I saw a mournful band, ‘With hair dishevell'd and with arms revers'd, ‘In solemn rank advancing from the strand. ‘As on they came in sorrow deep immers'd, ‘An exclamation loud of anguish burst: ‘For brave Martel's departed soul they pray'd; ‘And, as his fam'd atchievements were rehears'd, ‘The wound which grac'd his bosom they display'd, ‘And steep'd with tears the bier on which the Chief was laid. CXIV ‘We gaz'd in silence on the sable train, ‘Which in lugubrious pomp it's progress kept, ‘And slowly wound along the sea-girt plain. ‘Thro' the still air the trumpet's full note swept; ‘Now swell'd the strain, in death-like pause now slept, ‘As sadly rose the melancholy dirge: ‘The awful chorus o'er our senses crept, ‘While, from the shore, the still responsive surge, ‘With hollow murm'rings seem'd it's sympathy to urge. CXV ‘With measur'd cadence and impressive state ‘They march'd, 'till underneath a pine's green shade ‘They stopp'd, as if our presence to await. ‘As we approach'd, we saw a grave new made, ‘On either side of which were duly laid ‘Martel's bright armour, while his standard proud, ‘His banner, and his flag were high display'd. ‘At seemly distance stood th' attentive croud, ‘While Hubert o'er the bier in mute dejection bow'd. CXVI ‘When to the sad assembly we drew near, ‘He gaz'd upon us with a long-drawn sigh, ‘And, vainly struggling to suppress the tear ‘Which stood collected in his glist'ning eye, ‘He thus exclaim'd: “Oh! from those realms on high, “Where Cherubim th' Eternal's praise proclaim, “And Seraphim in songs extatic vie, “Listen, brave Hero! while thy deathless name “And patriotic worth we consecrate to fame! CXVII “High in the records of approving time “The warrior's prowess history shall attest, “But higher yet the energy sublime “Of those transcendent souls, who sink to rest, “Mourn'd by the brave, and by their country bless'd. “Thy sainted mem'ry shall survive the tomb; “Thy deeds shall fire the youthful champion's breast: “From thine his virtues shall their mould assume, “And chivalry like thine for countless ages bloom. CXVIII “Here let the earth thy lov'd remains receive! “Let friendship here her fond memorial place, “And o'er thy corse perennial garlands weave! “Let her record thy truth, thy manly grace, “Thy valour signaliz'd in glory's race! “And here, while gazing on the verdant mound “Which o'er thy dust shall heave, let her retrace “Thy modest worth, thy constancy renown'd, “And that illustrious end which thy atchievements crown'd!” CXIX ‘He ceas'd. Again the solemn chorus rose: ‘Around the mingling modulation spread, ‘Soothing our heart-felt sorrows to repose. “And oh!” they cried, “as here you pensive tread “'Mid the proud trophies of the honour'd dead, “Stop, warrior! and on gallant Martel's bier “With fond remembrance and affection shed “The passing tribute of a grateful tear! “Oh! let your pious grief his gen'rous spirit cheer! CXX “Nor be the daring and heroic deed “Of self-devoted Talebor unsung! “For England's glory he preferr'd to bleed: “Old in renown, as yet in years tho' young, “He grac'd the worthy lineage whence he sprung, “And won a praise beyond the reach of fate. “Pride of our Isle! and theme of ev'ry tongue! “On thee shall endless eulogies await, “On thee in life and death alike belov'd and great! CXXI “What tho' no tomb, no consecrated ground, “With custom'd rites protect thy honour'd dust? “What tho' above thee ocean's waves resound, “And tempests howl with over-whelming gust? “Our mem'ry, faithful to it's sacred trust, “While thus our raptur'd souls to Heav'n ascend, “Shall stamp thy worth and dignify thy bust: “Still shall regret with admiration blend, “And glory's choicest meed thy deathless fame attend!” CXXII ‘As ceas'd the mournful lay, the Chiefs resum'd ‘Their pious toils, and wet with many a tear, ‘In the cold earth Martel's remains inhum'd: ‘On the tall pine, which spread it's branches near, ‘They join'd his standard and his arms to rear. ‘As deeply pond'ring stood the host around, ‘I thus exclaim'd: “Eternal Father hear! “Thou, by whose aid these regions we have found, “Thou, whose almighty hand our enterprise has crown'd! CXXIII “Oh! deign with fav'ring eye our zeal to view; “Grant that, still mindful of thy great design, “To Judah's cause and honour's dictates true, “Our spirits warm'd with energy divine “May glory's call with thy behest combine! “If thy supreme, inscrutable decree “Should here the period of our lives define, “Grant that our souls, from sin redeem'd by thee, “With raptur'd saints may share a bless'd eternity.” CXXIV ‘As thus I pray'd, my brave companions felt ‘Congenial transport: on the blood-stain'd ground, ‘With uprais'd eyes and hands out-stretch'd they knelt, ‘When lo! we heard upon our right resound ‘A thund'ring peal, and light'nings flash'd around. ‘Our minds a zeal enthusiastic caught: ‘We hail'd the awful and inspiring sound ‘Which seem'd with Heav'n's approving influence fraught, ‘And turning tow'rds the camp Lusignan's tents we sought. END OF BOOK VI. BOOK VII. ARGUMENT. Richard describes the Assault and Capture of Acre.—Adjournment of the Diet. I ‘Across the sky the shades of ev'ning stole, ‘The sun's last rays scarce ting'd the cloudy west, ‘And night began to urge her dark controul. ‘Silence throughout the camp prevail'd: to rest ‘The Champions of the Cross themselves address'd, ‘Save, where the Gallic host their arms prepar'd, ‘And gave commandment for the morrow's quest. ‘To Philip's tent the anxious Chiefs repair'd, ‘And with their Prince the cares of preparation shar'd. II ‘There the bold Senechal of rich Champagne, ‘Joinville, was found, in many a combat fam'd, ‘With Montmorency, D'Avalon, Sabran, ‘And brave Des Barres, the French Achilles nam'd: ‘There came Nanteuil, with martial zeal inflam'd, ‘De Marby, Beaujeu, and renown'd Sargines; ‘These of their Monarch's Knights the title claim'd: ‘In danger's hour still foremost were they seen, ‘By martial zeal inspir'd, undaunted and serene. III ‘There Mauvoisin, grey in encounters grown, ‘With Villehardouin, hasten'd to appear: ‘These follow'd Enguerrand, for valour known, ‘Chatillon of the Templars Chief, Sancerre, ‘Impetuous Montfort, Pontiniac, Fougeres, ‘Rouvrai, unconscious of approaching fate, ‘St. Vallery, and Clermont puissant peer. ‘These in the royal tent assembled sate, ‘When Philip thus commenc'd the dignified debate. IV “Chieftains! it suits us well awhile to pause, “Lest rashly on a service we proceed, “Of such importance to the Christian cause. “The fate of thousands hangs upon the deed. “To conquest if our gallant host we lead, “The voice of Europe shall our efforts hail, “And fame shall grace us with her choicest meed; “But, in our arduous contest should we fail, “Where from contempt and shame our standards shall we vail? V “For more than two long years, it well is known “Acre the Christian forces has withstood. “I need not tell what constancy have shewn “The Pagan Chiefs, or how, 'mid scenes of blood, “Reduc'd by pestilence and want of food, “They unsubdued the chance of war sustain'd. “In vain Thuringia, anxious to conclude “The siege protracted, his resources drain'd: “His gallant warriors bled, but no advantage gain'd. VI “If thus alone, unaided by their Prince, “They stood the time's rude shock, now, doubly bold, “Against our bands their might they will evince, “Since Saladin their efforts shall behold, “And since, no more by famine's gripe controul'd, “Fresh combatants their lofty walls defend, “And hosts immense our leaguer'd force infold, “Prepar'd, when need requires, their aid to lend, “And with confed'rate arms fresh succours to extend. VII “Such, and so well-appointed is our foe. “Illustrious Peers! no common dangers call “Your gen'rous spirits constancy to shew. “The hero's soul no perils should appal: “Whether before you ramparts high to fall, “Or grac'd with conquest honour's meed to claim, “Your fathers' glories and your own recal: “Oh! keep them sacred from reproach and shame, “And to your sons transmit the record of your fame! VIII “Now, lov'd companions! best support of France! “Now be your zeal and martial prowess seen. “Ere morning dawn, our stately tow'rs advance, “Our Catapultas huge, and each machine, “With rocky fragments charg'd and weapons keen, “To crush their walls, and thin their close-throng'd line. “Their efforts to direct, let bold Sargines “With Joinville sage and brave Pontiniac join, “While Nanteuil and Fougeres their well-known skill combine. IX “Should these to shake the tow'ring heights succeed “And open an approach, be thine, Des Barres, “Thy vet'ran legions to th' assault to lead. “Let Rouvrai and Sabran thy labours share: “While Villehardouin and Beaujeu prepare “To face the Pagans who our camp inclose. “Watchful meantime their succours prompt to bear, “Our other Chiefs shall a reserve compose, “To aid their friends repuls'd, and check th' insulting foes. X “Now, comrades bold! adieu! let ev'ry Peer “His orders issue for to-morrow's fight, “Convene his legions, and their spirits cheer. “Soon as o'er yonder hills the dawning light “Shall glimmer on the brow of dusky night, “Our great attempt must call us to the field. “Then let our gallant Frenchmen prove their might! “Let them St. Denis cry! their weapons wield! “Nor cease their bloody toils 'till Acre's ramparts yield!” XI ‘He said. The Chiefs, retiring from his tent, ‘To seek their troops, who now reposing lay, ‘With anxious mien and hasten'd footsteps went. ‘They, well-dispos'd the summons to obey, ‘Shook off light slumber, and in dread array ‘Their engines huge and rocky fragments plac'd; ‘Some drain'd the goblet, some retir'd to pray, ‘While some anew their helms and cors'lets brac'd, ‘And, anxious for the proof, their limbs in steel encas'd. XII ‘Now sank the planets in the western wave, ‘While, rising o'er the hills, the morning star ‘Of quick-approaching day his presage gave: ‘O'er Mahumeria's height, as beaming far ‘His sanguine orb denoted bloody war, ‘He blaz'd portentous thro' the doubtful gloom. ‘Of either host the banners stream'd afar, ‘And mingling warriors, heedless of their doom, ‘Rush'd thro' the hostile camps their station to assume. XIII ‘As when, on some unshelter'd mountain's side, ‘A shepherd sees the sky with clouds embrown'd, ‘And mantling darkness veil th' horizon wide, ‘Wrapt in suspense, in dread attention bound, ‘He hears the solemn thunder roll around, ‘And trembling gazes on his fleecy care: ‘So, struck with awe, we heard the trumpet's sound ‘Throughout the camp invading the still air, ‘And summoning the Chiefs their battle to prepare. XIV ‘The lord of day now ting'd the eastern sky. ‘As his first glowing beams of light he shed ‘On Acre's battlements and ramparts high, ‘We view'd their threat'ning front and turrets dread: ‘The widely yawning moat which round them spread, ‘The outward wall which clos'd it's vast extent, ‘Flank'd with full many a tow'r, whose lofty head ‘Frown'd o'er the plain all access to prevent, ‘Seem'd against Gallia's force a barrier to present. XV ‘Yet more tremendous still the host appear'd, ‘Which crown'd their ample range and rugged height. ‘Clashing their arms, their banners proud they rear'd, ‘And, as if conscious of resistless might, ‘Mock'd at the Christian bands and dar'd the fight: ‘While on the hills which girt around the plain, ‘Exceeding far the stretch of mortal sight, ‘The Pagan Chiefs drew up their warlike train, ‘Prepar'd, as need might call, their brethren to sustain. XVI ‘Such was the scene that met our wond'ring eyes, ‘Which might the boldest warriors have impress'd ‘With sentiments of awe and strange surprise. ‘But these the soul of Philip ne'er confess'd: ‘Whate'er foul passions might disgrace his breast, ‘It burn'd with glory's bright and hallow'd flame: ‘Nor toil nor danger could his zeal arrest; ‘Forth from his tent with steps assur'd he came, ‘And 'midst his ranks advanc'd, as confident of fame. XVII ‘And grounded well his sanguine visions seem'd. ‘Far o'er the field, drawn out in gay parade, ‘Full fifty thousand casques resplendent beam'd; ‘The noblest Chiefs of France, in steel array'd, ‘Their many-blazon'd banners there display'd, ‘Eager their Monarch's fortune to partake: ‘Their countless engines were in order laid, ‘Of power the vast and solid walls to break, ‘And from their deepest base the battlements to shake. XVIII ‘Thro' the extended line glad murmurs broke ‘As pass'd the Gallic King, who, fill'd with joy ‘To note their zeal, the warriors thus bespoke. “If now your Heav'n-born valour ye employ “By deeds of worth yon ramparts to destroy, “And on those heights your banners proud to place, “Renown immortal, fame without alloy, “And Europe's thanks your enterprise shall grace, “Nor shall your well-earn'd wreaths oblivious time deface. XIX “To-day begins the harvest of your hope! “Let your sharp faulchions deathless honour reap! “Give to your just resentments ample scope! “The ruthless Pagans, who on yonder steep “Their post as yet to arms impervious keep, “Drive from their strong intrenchments: like a flood “Surcharg'd with wintry torrents, loud and deep, “Bear on the trembling foe your terrors rude, “And mark your dread career in characters of blood!” XX ‘He said. As when o'er Snowdon's long-drawn height ‘From struggling clouds the rattling thunder breaks, ‘And rolls tremendous 'mid the gloom of night, ‘From ev'ry cragg affrighted Echo wakes, ‘The lab'ring mountain thro' each cavern shakes, ‘And, startled by convulsing nature's throes, ‘The screaming eagle his lone cliff forsakes: ‘So thro' the host a shout of transport rose, ‘Which breath'd defiance loud and vengeance on their foes. XXI ‘Each Chieftain hasten'd now his band to join, ‘And, as to bold attack or safe defence ‘Might best conduce, to form his martial line. ‘We gaz'd intent: but short was our suspense, ‘For straightway 'gainst the outward wall immense, ‘And the high rampart which the town surrounded, ‘Th' assault Sargines his legions bad commence. ‘Drawn to their stretch his engines huge resounded, ‘And from their concave beds the rocky fragments bounded. XXII ‘Some on the slope abrupt were seen t'alight, ‘Forming deep chasms, and harrowing up the ground: ‘Some ended in the moat their downward flight, ‘And with their strokes uncouth dispers'd around ‘The foaming waters from their beds profound. ‘But one huge mass, with elevation dread ‘Struck on a lofty tow'r; with horrid sound ‘The tott'ring fabric bow'd it's haughty head, ‘Sank to the dust, and far it's giant ruin spread. XXIII ‘Soon as the wide-extending breach was seen, ‘Sargines exclaim'd, “Brave comrades! charge again “With thunder-dealing rocks each stout machine! “With aim assur'd a shower destructive rain, “'Till, from their tow'ring summits to the plain, “The scatter'd vestiges of either wall “No more your road to victory shall restrain! “Now your full force exert, let Acre fall, “Let Gallia's matchless worth the Saracens appal!” XXIV ‘He said. Forthwith they gave their engines play, ‘And once again their dire contents compell'd ‘Thro' the resounding air to cleave their way. ‘When their intent brave Caracos beheld, ‘Unaw'd by peril and by toil unquell'd, ‘He bad his host return the greeting rude. ‘Now, as the adverse rocks their progress held, ‘And high their strange and circling course pursued, ‘It seem'd as if with Heav'n the Titans war renew'd. XXV ‘Their doubling arch the armies view'd aghast, ‘And breath'd a prayer th' Eternal to invoke ‘As o'er their heads the whizzing portents pass'd, ‘When fresh alarm a wonder new awoke. ‘Two mighty rocks with swift opposing stroke ‘Met in their mid career: with deaf'ning sound ‘Their texture firm the strong collision broke; ‘In many a shatter'd fragment to the ground ‘Falling amain, they spread their deadly force around. XXVI ‘Where of the Gallic host the vanguard stood ‘The pond'rous show'r descended: 'mid their rank ‘Full many a gasping warrior fell; their blood ‘In copious streams the thirsty herbage drank. ‘Struck to the ground the bold Pontiniac sank: ‘A rugged mass with destination dread ‘Crush'd his right arm and deeply-heaving flank; ‘The shades of death his manly brow o'er-spread, ‘To scenes of endless bliss his gen'rous spirit fled. XXVII ‘With still more dire effect, on either side, ‘Their missile charge the adverse engines sent, ‘Extending ravage, death and havock wide. ‘Destruction sure awaited their descent: ‘The Pagan host before their fury bent; ‘The strong entrenchments where their warriors swarm'd ‘With force resistless fearfully they rent, ‘Smote the broad ramparts and the mounds deform'd, ‘While thro' the town expos'd the madd'ning tempest storm'd. XXVIII ‘No longer now his zeal Des Barres suppress'd: ‘He wav'd his oft-tried faulchion in the air, ‘And thus with potent voice his bands address'd. “Comrades! 'tis our's the glorious work to share: “Now 'gainst the recreant foe your fury bear, “And honour's path 'mid slaughter'd Pagans trace! “Success attends on those who bravely dare. “Let hope of high renown our sinews brace, “And may immortal fame our manly efforts grace!” XXIX ‘Not otherwise than when with bellowings hoarse ‘A mountain wave, by southern blasts propell'd, ‘Sweeps o'er the deep with wild resistless course; ‘By many a tributary billow swell'd ‘It rolls it's foaming mass with rage unquell'd: ‘So from the camp impetuous o'er the plain ‘Their march assur'd the Gallic legions held, ‘And, as they sought the adverse heights to gain, ‘Scarce could their leader's voice their headstrong zeal restrain. XXX ‘Yet, as the tow'ring and firm-rooted rock ‘Withstands the ocean's power, and unsubdued ‘His station keeps regardless of the shock; ‘So on the recent breach with carnage strew'd, ‘Prepar'd for action and encounter rude, ‘Their banners proudly waving in the wind, ‘The bold defenders of the fortress stood; ‘While either wall with warriors fierce was lin'd, ‘With each his sep'rate charge by Caracos assign'd. XXXI ‘Noureddin, who from Nubia's sultry plain ‘Had led his swarthy legions, stood prepar'd ‘The outward wall dismantled to maintain, ‘And on the breach the Gallic fury dar'd. ‘Arm'd for the proof with him undaunted shar'd ‘The dang'rous warfare a determin'd band, ‘Who at his call to Acre had repair'd, ‘And now, obedient to his high command, ‘Spread wide their threat'ning front the Christians to withstand. XXXII ‘Far as the ramparts stretch'd their rude extent, ‘Was seen a long and terrible array ‘Of archers who their bows of tough yew bent. ‘On every hand appear'd a dread display ‘Of warlike engines, while around them lay ‘Enormous darts and stones, whose massy weight ‘And size might fill th' assailants with dismay; ‘With every instrument, which ranc'rous hate ‘Fram'd to complete the work of desolating fate. XXXIII ‘But all this hostile shew and stern parade, ‘The Pagans' menace and their vaunting cry, ‘On the assailants small impression made. ‘Onward they rush'd and rear'd their weapons high, ‘'Till to the guarded breach approaching nigh, ‘The adverse fronts in contest dire engag'd. ‘Now Slaughter 'gan her bloody work to ply; ‘Waving her fatal torch Destruction rag'd, ‘And Death his havock urg'd with fury unassuag'd. XXXIV ‘Now on the walls he rear'd his ghastly form, ‘And with appalling shrieks amid the gloom ‘Pour'd on the Christian force his ruthless storm: ‘Now, as aloft he shook his sable plume, ‘His hand obscene confirm'd their hapless doom, ‘And many a gasping warrior prostrate brought, ‘Whose injur'd shade, unhonour'd by a tomb, ‘Still hov'ring o'er the ramparts where he fought, ‘Laments with wild acclaim the woes which there were wrought. XXXV ‘Needless and painful were the task to tell ‘What Chiefs were then compell'd their breath to yield, ‘Or who beneath the Pagan vengeance fell, ‘And with their lives their holy warfare seal'd. ‘Beyond the rest, high brandishing his shield, ‘The brave Des Barres spurr'd on his courser proud, ‘And held his progress o'er th' ensanguin'd field: ‘His manly voice proclaim'd defiance loud, ‘As with horrific grace he chas'd the recreant croud. XXXVI ‘Close by his side the gallant Montmirail ‘Rang'd thro' the adverse ranks, and far around ‘Was seen their close-throng'd legions to assail. ‘For mutual friendship as for worth renown'd, ‘The kindred Chiefs together still were found; ‘One impulse still associate they confess'd, ‘And hail'd alike the trumpet's cheering sound. ‘Now, as across the plain their steeds they press'd, ‘Nought could their knightly worth and joint assault arrest. XXXVII ‘Soon as the warlike pair Noureddin view'd, ‘And saw his squadrons o'er the champaign chas'd ‘Seeking by flight t'escape th' encounter rude, ‘Vaulting upon his courser fleet in haste ‘His weighty mace he caught, his vizor brac'd, ‘And thus with hurried voice to Osmyn cried: “Say, shall our well-earn'd glories be disgrac'd? “Shall yonder knights uncheck'd our force deride, “And thro' our trembling host spread desolation wide? XXXVIII “Let us together seek th' insulting foe, “And, in our Prophet confident, unite “The matchless force of Afric's sons to shew!” ‘Thus spake the Chieftain: from the rugged height ‘His foaming courser bore him to the fight. ‘Impell'd by equal fury and disdain ‘Osmyn his word obey'd: with footsteps light ‘His fleet Arabian scour'd along the plain ‘With slaughter red, o'er heaps of wounded and of slain. XXXIX ‘Them, as their enterprising course they press'd, ‘Bold Montmirail remarking, thus aloud ‘In terms exulting his brave friend address'd: “Mark you, where yonder thro' the yielding croud “Advance two champions, whose demeanour proud “And hasty movement note some great intent? “They seem as if with prowess high endow'd. “If here they come on hostile purpose bent, “Their meditated charge 'twere fitting we prevent.” XL ‘Thus saying, in it's rest he fix'd his lance, ‘And forward rode. Des Barres the foe beheld, ‘And with like ardour made his steed advance. ‘Thus, when black clouds with sulph'rous vapours swell'd ‘By clouds their race opposing are repell'd, ‘Far thro' the sky their dire contents are hurl'd: ‘With crash tremendous and with rage unquell'd ‘Up-rooted forests thro' the air are whirl'd, ‘And madd'ning elements convulse the suffering world. XLI ‘Noureddin, spurring on his charger black, ‘With Montmirail first met, and, waving high ‘His mace of steel, commenc'd the dread attack. ‘With sinewy arm and quickly judging eye ‘He struck the Christian's spear, which, glancing by, ‘Innoxious quiver'd. Ere his courser's flight ‘By Montmirail was check'd, with boastful cry ‘He rear'd his mace, and with resistless might ‘Rudely his shoulders smote, and crush'd his armour bright. XLII ‘Casting aside his lance, his glitt'ring blade ‘Grasping with manly firmness, Montmirail ‘Soon sturdily th' aggressor's wrongs repaid. ‘Now rung with blows each well-attemper'd mail, ‘Loud as the floor which with his twanging flail ‘The sturdy peasant strikes, or as the field ‘When driv'n by storms descends the clatt'ring hail. ‘Not less resounded either casque and shield, ‘Nor did with less effect each Chief his weapon wield. XLIII ‘Both unappall'd their bloody toil pursued, ‘Both sought the strife by valour to decide, ‘And steadily maintain'd th' encounter rude. ‘But keen Noureddin an advantage spied, ‘And swift as light'ning on his foeman's side ‘His huge mace struck. Stagg'ring he dropt his rein, ‘From his pale lips gush'd forth a purple tide, ‘Senseless to earth he fell, while o'er the plain ‘Rush'd his affrighted steed the Christian camp to gain. XLIV ‘Exulting in his vict'ry thus atchiev'd, ‘Across the field his eye Noureddin glanc'd, ‘Where, by Des Barres unhors'd, he straight perceiv'd ‘Osmyn his friend in death's embrace entranc'd. ‘Fir'd by the sight, indignant he advanc'd, ‘And, while his gesture fierce and eye inflam'd ‘Denoted vengeance doubly now enhanc'd, ‘And spoke the workings of his wrath untam'd, ‘With voice like thunder thus the sable Knight exclaim'd. XLV “Chieftain! whoe'er thou art, whose pow'rful hand “The fates have led o'er Osmyn to prevail, “Think not Noureddin's fury to withstand: “Before superior force your glories vail; “Soon shall your bands their leader's loss bewail!” “Boaster!” replied Des Barres, “some meaner sword “A foe like thee more fitly might assail, “And of thy recreant limbs a feast afford “For vultures hot for blood and beasts of prey abhorr'd! XLVI “So might'st thou nameless and unhonour'd fall! “But great revenge and Montmirail's lov'd shade “Inspire my arm and for atonement call. “Ye pow'rs immortal! now impart your aid, “Let your full influence now my soul pervade!” ‘With that his rowels sharply he applied, ‘And with his lance a stroke impetuous made; ‘Which when Noureddin saw, he turn'd aside, ‘And, as his foe rode on, with lusty mace replied. XLVII ‘So heavily he made the steel descend, ‘That to his saddle's bow th' astounded knight ‘Full sorely shaken was compell'd to bend. ‘Noureddin now, more eager for the fight, ‘His weapon rais'd, and summoning his might ‘Aim'd at a blow the contest to conclude. ‘But vain his murd'rous purpose: from it's height ‘The mace descending, with encounter rude ‘Struck his own steed, and bath'd his ample flank in blood. XLVIII ‘Ill did the wound the lordly charger brook, ‘But, raging madly, all dominion spurn'd, ‘And roughly in his seat Noureddin shook. ‘With ready eye Des Barres their strife discern'd: ‘His nimble courser suddenly he turn'd, ‘And with redoubled force the foe assail'd, ‘Whose breast, where rage and indignation burn'd, ‘His sharp lance meeting, pierc'd his cuirass mail'd, ‘And drove him to the earth on it's stout shaft impal'd. XLIX ‘As his well-temper'd weapon from the wound ‘The victor Chief with strenuous effort tore, ‘Forth gush'd a sanguine flood, which far around ‘Mantling distain'd the verdant soil with gore. ‘While to the camp some sad attendants bore ‘Young Montmirail, if haply there a leech ‘His strength by sov'reign med'cine might restore, ‘Des Barres his foaming courser urg'd, to reach ‘His gallant band which strove to penetrate the breach. L ‘There, rank with rank engag'd and man with man, ‘Each army sought it's courage to display. ‘As first in peril's front renown'd Sabran ‘Thro' mingled Pagans cut his eager way, ‘Associate in his gen'rous toils, Rouvrai, ‘Wielding his crimson'd sword, their fury brav'd, ‘And thro' their crouded legions spread dismay: ‘While Discord o'er the scene with joy deprav'd ‘Cast her envenom'd glance, and high her pinions wav'd. LI ‘Awhile, as nicely balanc'd, either host ‘Opposing stood; neither advantage gain'd, ‘Nor to superior might their station lost; ‘Each steadily the chance of war sustain'd, ‘And Conquest her still dubious scale maintain'd: ‘But soon the hard-press'd Infidels gave back, ‘While Gallia's sons, as if they toil disdain'd, ‘With freshen'd zeal pursued their bold attack, ‘And o'er their slaughter'd foes mark'd their vindictive track. LII ‘With fatal haste th' embattled wall they sought, ‘Where in terrific range machines were spread, ‘Ready for action and with ruin fraught. ‘Vollies of darts with destination dread ‘The thund'ring Briccolas in torrents shed: ‘From sturdy bows unerring arrows flew; ‘And boiling oil and pitch, and molten lead, ‘From cauldrons huge a more ignoble crew ‘On the throng'd combatants with savage malice threw; LIII ‘Or cast a deadly show'r of Grecian fire: ‘That compound foul, to western climes unknown, ‘Pregnant with horrors and with torments dire! ‘It's livid flames consum'd the flinty stone; ‘Pervading steel, it scorch'd the warrior's bone, ‘And stunn'd his senses with it's noisome stench: ‘Plung'd in the stream it's vigour still was shewn; ‘No water could it's power infuriate drench, ‘Nor had experience yet it's terrors taught to quench. LIV ‘With these another band conspir'd to fling, ‘Where'er the Christian force was closely pent, ‘Full many a wooden hoop, whose circling ring ‘With sulphur and bitumen was besprent. ‘These, all inflam'd, with aim assur'd they sent, ‘And, as amid the warlike ranks they fell, ‘The hapless victims of their curs'd descent, ‘With shrieks of anguish and despairing yell, ‘Writh'd in the burning orb, and felt the pangs of hell. LV ‘No valour could such modes of war sustain: ‘Yet, whatsoever valour could perform, ‘The Gallic troops effected, tho' in vain. ‘Amid the perils of the fiery storm ‘As sank the leaders, a succeeding swarm ‘Strode o'er their corses and assail'd the wall: ‘Tho' death was present in his strangest form, ‘Nought could suffice their courage to appal, ‘One impulse seem'd to guide and animate them all. LVI ‘Still did we gaze on their transcendent worth, ‘When, from the adverse quarter on the right, ‘A tempest yet more horrible broke forth. ‘From Turo and from Mahumeria's height ‘Ferocious Tecadin led on his might, ‘To force the camp and aid his friends distress'd. ‘Onward they rush'd impetuous to the fight, ‘And ev'ry Chieftain, as he wav'd his crest, ‘Join'd in the cry of war, and Mahomet address'd. LVII ‘Not louder, when, by headstrong tempests swell'd, ‘Ocean's mad billows on the shore rebound, ‘Not more tremendous, when, by rocks repell'd, ‘Her deaf'ning fury shakes the vast profound, ‘Than rose the savage and discordant sound. ‘Far as extended the entrenchment wide ‘Their varied armament encircled round; ‘Some boldly sought to mount the rampart's side, ‘And some with engines huge the yielding portals plied. LVIII ‘Soon as th' alarm was heard, renown'd Beaujeu ‘With watchful care and provident intent ‘To the broad rampart with his legions flew. ‘'Mid the assailants on the steep ascent, ‘A show'r of darts and massy rocks they sent, ‘While glaive-men dealt destruction on the foes, ‘And sturdy bowmen their tough arches bent. ‘Yet vain their efforts prov'd the charge t'oppose; ‘Tho' hundreds bleeding fell, successive hundreds rose. LIX ‘Numbers, not valour, o'er the French prevail'd: ‘Tho' perils threaten'd from the heights above, ‘Their battlements the hardy Pagans scal'd, ‘And from their works the brave defenders drove. ‘On ev'ry side with adverse fate they strove: ‘While Tecadin urg'd on his desp'rate band, ‘Plum'd with success, their sabre's edge to prove, ‘From Acre's walls, unable to withstand ‘The foe, they saw their troops disperse on ev'ry hand. LX ‘Around confusion, dread and horror reign'd; ‘O'er either host remorseless Ate soar'd, ‘And the parch'd field promiscuous slaughter stain'd. ‘Still from their ranks with countless numbers stor'd ‘New bands of combatants the Pagans pour'd, ‘Careless of life and prodigal of blood; ‘Now lance with lance was mix'd and sword with sword, ‘In onset close the mingled warriors stood, ‘While from their riven mails fast stream'd a gory flood. LXI ‘Then shone pre-eminent the Gallic Prince. ‘When hardly hope his cruel fortunes cheer'd, ‘He sought his worth by valiant deeds t'evince: ‘Where rang'd most close the adverse hosts appear'd, ‘Dauntless he flew; his lance a passage clear'd, ‘And many an infidel to fate consign'd. ‘With him his chosen knights their faulchions rear'd, ‘His kingdom's pride with him their efforts join'd, ‘Or honour to atchieve, or glorious death to find. LXII ‘But fruitless prov'd their zeal and courage tried: ‘Stern Tecadin was master of the field, ‘And all was havock now and ruin wide. ‘There Villehardouin sank; no more to wield ‘His potent arms, his faith Chatillon seal'd; ‘There Rouvrai, gallant peer, his labours crown'd: ‘The brave Fougeres, his breath compell'd to yield, ‘With Enguerrand, no less by fame renown'd, ‘Close by their Monarch's side a fate distinguish'd found. LXIII ‘'Twere vain the mournful catalogue to swell ‘With those less known, who, in the carnage wild, ‘Beneath the fury of the Pagans fell. ‘Yet, on all these Affection once had smil'd, ‘Had hung with rapture on the parent mild, ‘With fondness o'er the parting husband wept, ‘Or clasp'd with extacy the duteous child! ‘Now, from the face of genial nature swept, ‘In their unhonour'd graves the heart's best feelings slept. LXIV ‘While thus the battle ominously rag'd, ‘And fresh battalions to the combat press'd, ‘Whose cries of triumph further wrongs presag'd, ‘Lusignan and his Chiefs I thus address'd. “Too long I've check'd the feelings of my breast; “But, while a chance, however small, remain'd, “That Philip might the adverse host arrest, “My grief and indignation I restrain'd, “And o'er my anxious soul dominion strict maintain'd. LXV “I knew his jealous spirit ill could bear “That others should his hop'd-for glories seize, “Or in the harvest of his laurels share. “But danger ill with haughtiness agrees; “Nor should my help his stubborn pride displease. “Give but the word, and here my vengeful blade “The Saracenic fury shall appease, “And on their squadrons fearfully array'd “Shall retribution full and dreadful be display'd.” LXVI ‘As thus with warmth and energy I spoke, ‘Throughout th' encircling Peers, whose noble pride ‘Inaction scorn'd, a shout of transport broke, ‘When thus Lusignan eagerly replied. “May fav'ring Heav'n your arm to conquest guide! “May fame and victory o'er your banners wave! “Proceed, great Prince! and from th' o'erwhelming tide “Of Pagan rage the Gallic Monarch save, “Still glorious tho' o'erthrown, and tho' successless brave!” LXVII ‘As when arrang'd high-mettled coursers stand, ‘Eyeing the distant goal across the plain, ‘Soon as th' inspiring trumpet gives command, ‘Forward they dart regardless of the rein, ‘Their eye-balls flash, their vig'rous limbs they strain, ‘Sweep o'er the vallies and surmount the height, ‘While bursting seems each agitated vein: ‘So, fill'd with hope, and confident of might, ‘My bold companions rush'd impatient to the fight. LXVIII ‘When first the fortunes of the Gallic host ‘Doubtfully shew'd, I bad each English Peer ‘Repair with silent caution to his post, ‘Thence, when occasion should present, to bear ‘His pow'rful aid their suff'ring cause to cheer. ‘A far-rang'd band, in many a combat tried, ‘Mauleon held prepar'd and station'd near, ‘Whose gallant movements I myself might guide, ‘To check th' insulting foes and stem their boist'rous tide. LXIX ‘Bold Mortimer I caution'd to remark ‘Whatever on the town's wide ramparts pass'd; ‘And Leicester bad on board the fleet t'embark, ‘And 'gainst the sea-girt walls to place in haste ‘The Floating Castle, which, ere yet I trac'd ‘My eastern course, in England had been made. ‘This, from six stages, burning wild-fire cast, ‘And stones immense, from Rhine's broad stream convey'd, ‘Of matchless size and force with aim destructive play'd. LXX ‘All thus prepar'd to meet the bloody toil, ‘Undaunted Reginald my standard rear'd, ‘Where the gaunt Dragon, symbol of our Isle, ‘With out-spread wings and flaming jaws appear'd. ‘Uther, who erst the British empire steer'd, ‘From Merlin had it, who the fabric spun: ‘In days and glory old the King rever'd ‘Gave it to Arthur his illustrious son, ‘Who oft beneath it fought and fame immortal won. LXXI ‘Soon as unroll'd it wanton'd in their view, ‘It's web auspicious every warrior hail'd, ‘Wav'd his good faulchion, home his arrow drew, ‘And manfully the Saracens assail'd. ‘While Mortimer the breach tremendous scal'd ‘Strew'd with the slain, and Leicester's potent Chief ‘His Castle's terrors on the town detail'd, ‘Impell'd by honour, gen'rous shame and grief, ‘O'er the wide plain we bore to Gallia's King relief. LXXII ‘Surrounded by the foe the Monarch stood, ‘Hot with the fight, his blade with slaughter red, ‘His cuirass and his helm distain'd with blood. ‘Full many a warrior brave, whose soul was fled, ‘Lay ghastly round him in confusion dread: ‘Himself, still daring 'mid the wild alarm, ‘Advanc'd with feeble and uncertain tread; ‘No more with energy his wearied arm ‘Fell on the adverse bands, or wrought it's custom'd harm. LXXIII ‘Thro' the thick phalanx which our host defied, ‘Intent the Prince to save, we hew'd our way: ‘And now, our purpose high atchiev'd, I cried, “Thus let a friend his ardent zeal display! “Tho' fate forbid success, tho' lost the day, “Still shall thy matchless worth recorded stand: “Fame shall to long posterity convey “The valiant deeds enacted by thy hand, “The glories of thy brave tho' unsuccessful band. LXXIV “Thou seem'st with toil and labour overspent, “And from thy crest a bloody torrent flows: “Disdain not to give o'er thy great intent, “Nor dread thy honours well-atchiev'd to lose, “While we, yet fresh, the Pagan host oppose, “And check the progress of th' insulting crew. “Fleeting shall prove the triumph of your foes! “Soon shall our swords their yielding ranks pursue, “And Tecadin ere long his bold attempt shall rue!” LXXV ‘As thus to sooth his wounded pride I aim'd, ‘With gesture fierce which spoke his strong despair, ‘And interrupted phrase, the King exclaim'd: “Thine aid I scorn—thy specious arts forbear— “Think not the honours of the field to share, “Nor strive with me in glory's race to vie— “None but myself my well-earn'd wreaths shall wear— “My arm can yet the hostile force defy, “Nor needs a rival's help to purchase victory!” LXXVI ‘He said. As if he further speech disdain'd, ‘Again to wield his weapon he essay'd: ‘But him no more his trembling limbs sustain'd, ‘No more his hand his dread intent obey'd; ‘He felt a death-like cold his frame pervade, ‘And stagg'ring fell. From off th' encrimson'd ground ‘The fainting King some warriors straight convey'd, ‘And carefully his helm and mail unbound, ‘To staunch the blood which flow'd from many a gaping wound. LXXVII ‘Meantime around us rose a fearful cry. ‘Before the foe triumphant we beheld ‘The Gallic legions in disorder fly, ‘While Tecadin their routed bands impell'd, ‘And mark'd his fatal way with rage unquell'd. ‘From the broad rampart, guarded now no more, ‘Fresh combatants his host insulting swell'd, ‘And, as their succour ardently they bore, ‘Rear'd high their faulchions keen distain'd with Christian gore. LXXVIII ‘But soon we stemm'd the desolating tide. ‘Flush'd by success, with Gallic spoils bedeck'd, ‘The wild invaders who our pow'r defied ‘Firmly we met, right manfully we check'd, ‘And taught them English valour to respect. ‘Oh! would some Pow'r with animating flame ‘Inspire my soul, my languid speech direct! ‘Then should each lov'd and honourable name ‘Survive the wreck of time, immortaliz'd by fame! LXXIX ‘But tame and lifeless must description prove. ‘Here might be seen, o'er mingled heaps of dead, ‘With blade exterminating Pembroke rove, ‘And wide destruction thro' the Pagans spread: ‘There valiant Tancarville his vengeance shed; ‘And there Mauleon o'er the crouded field ‘His vet'ran bands with force o'erwhelming led; ‘While, in an adverse quarter, high his shield ‘Grac'd by the holy cross was Granville seen to wield. LXXX ‘There, with St. John's brave Knights, Ermengard bold ‘Unrivall'd deeds of chivalry perform'd. ‘Aloft their Order's standard they unroll'd: ‘At once by courage and religion warm'd, ‘Where most the fury of the battle storm'd ‘Ardent they rush'd, and spread around dismay. ‘Full many a corse their horses' hoofs deform'd, ‘And many a bleeding Chief around them lay, ‘And death and havock mark'd their devastating way. LXXXI ‘Not otherwise than when across the sky ‘Obnoxious vapours, bred from murky night, ‘By morn's enliv'ning breeze are forc'd to fly, ‘The foe retreated. With redoubled might ‘We follow'd close and urg'd the bloody fight; ‘Nor ceas'd we 'till their routed bands we drove ‘In wild disorder to the rampart's height, ‘Where still to mount Barbarian cohorts strove, ‘Eager their hate and thirst of Christian spoils to prove. LXXXII ‘Cursing his fortune now so foully chang'd, ‘Tho' not despairing yet the day to gain, ‘Fierce Tecadin with fatal progress rang'd. ‘As from their sheep-cot when a peasant train ‘A lion chace whom recent slaughters stain, ‘The lordly tyrant flight ignoble spurns; ‘Lashing his sides, erecting high his mane, ‘To meet his foe with madd'ning wrath he turns, ‘While either orb of sight with kindling vengeance burns: LXXXIII ‘So bold, so dreadful, the proud Chief appear'd, ‘When, as endow'd with force and courage new, ‘His giant form and potent hand he rear'd, ‘And on our host, who ceas'd not to pursue, ‘With dire intent and fell impatience flew. ‘Where'er he turn'd, in blood of Christians deep ‘His faulchion keen he fail'd not to imbrue, ‘And many a warrior forc'd in death to sleep, ‘And many a widow'd bride and orphan'd babe to weep. LXXXIV ‘Before his trenchant sword our forces bow'd, ‘While his hoarse voice like thunder loud he rais'd, ‘And on their ranks extermination vow'd. ‘At deeds so dread and threats so stern amaz'd, ‘My comrades lost in consternation gaz'd, ‘And valour's worth, tho' in a foe, confess'd. ‘Nor less the daring feats he wrought I prais'd: ‘But soon more urgent duties fir'd my breast, ‘Grasping my shield, I thus my wond'ring friends address'd. LXXXV “Champions of Christ! who in his sacred cause “Display your standards and for Judah fight, “Why in the race of glory do ye pause? “An easy conquest would but ill requite “Your great revenge and oft acknowledg'd might. “Poor is the triumph which no danger knows! “Superior perils gen'rous souls incite! “Behold! my arm the Pagan shall oppose, “And stamp by his defeat destruction on your foes!” LXXXVI ‘As I advanc'd, the Chief his faulchion heav'd, ‘And, by success inflam'd, by victory flush'd, ‘My sturdy onset unappall'd receiv'd. ‘Soon was each cuirass bruis'd, each helmet crush'd; ‘Encrimson'd streams in copious torrents gush'd: ‘And, as we strove with energy intense ‘And wav'd our bloody swords, the croud was hush'd; ‘Their faculties were numb'd, their voice, their sense, ‘Their breath itself was lost in horrible suspense. LXXXVII ‘Uncertain still the strife appear'd to float, ‘When on his shaggy crest, superbly crown'd ‘By an increasing silv'ry moon, I smote. ‘As fell the glitt'ring fragments to the ground, ‘In sudden trance his faculties were bound, ‘He rais'd instinctively his massy shield. ‘With shouts my comrades made the air resound, ‘As if already on th' ensanguin'd field ‘The Pagan overthrown had been compell'd to yield. LXXXVIII ‘But falsely deem'd they of the puissant Chief. ‘As Heav'n's bright luminary, when a cloud ‘His splendid orb obscures with passage brief, ‘And for awhile succeeds his pomp to shroud, ‘Bursts thro' the gloom and shines with radiance proud; ‘So from the stupor which his pow'rs entranc'd ‘The Persian Prince arous'd, with menace loud, ‘To dare the combat's issue quick advanc'd, ‘While from his eye-balls strain'd vindictive light'nings glanc'd. LXXXIX ‘A bolder warrior ne'er my arm engag'd: ‘Skilful to strike, to parry, or to wheel, ‘The dubious contest manfully he wag'd, ‘And on my batter'd helm he rung a peal ‘So vig'rous, as to make me backward reel, ‘And strive to guard against his fatal aim. ‘As thus he urg'd me with his trenchant steel, ‘The wond'ring Infidels, with fierce acclaim, ‘United to exalt their strenuous champion's name. XC ‘Not long I bore his salutation rude. ‘Breathing a pray'r th' Eternal to invoke, ‘With freshen'd ardour and with strength renew'd, ‘While tenfold fury in my breast awoke, ‘I rush'd upon him, and with pow'rful stroke ‘My debt of vengeance amply I repaid. ‘But now in twain my treach'rous weapon broke: ‘Unarm'd I stood, and destitute of aid, ‘T'abide the censure harsh of his well-temper'd blade. XCI ‘Soon as he saw me of my sword bereav'd, ‘Onward he press'd with new presumption fir'd. ‘On my broad shield his faulchion I receiv'd, ‘And, spite of his advantage thus acquir'd, ‘I warded off his strokes, and still retir'd, ‘Till, wearied, with less energy he wrought. ‘I watch'd th' occasion, and by Heav'n inspir'd, ‘As to inflict a blow again he sought, ‘With strenuous arm my foe around his waist I caught. XCII ‘Awhile I bound him in my rigid clasp, ‘While vainly he against my force rebell'd: ‘Then, on a sudden, loos'ning my firm grasp, ‘As high in air the struggling Chief I held, ‘And ev'ry fibre with the effort swell'd, ‘I cast him from me, and across the mound ‘Which rang'd along our camp my foe impell'd. ‘Headlong we saw him down the slope rebound, ‘Glancing from rock to rock, transfix'd with many a wound. XCIII ‘A cry of horror from the Pagans rose, ‘When thus their Chief falling amain they view'd, ‘And grief and fear their stricken senses froze. ‘Instant my comrades their assault renew'd, ‘And, as with new-born hope and strength endued, ‘Burst on their squadrons with resistless might, ‘And to the rampart's verge their host pursued, ‘Where still fresh warriors sought to gain the height, ‘Urg'd by their leader's voice, and goaded to the fight. XCIV ‘While thus we well aveng'd the wrongs of France, ‘And by our valour worthily redeem'd ‘The battle nearly lost by foul mischance, ‘When bent on slaughter every soldier seem'd, ‘And each his own the noble cause esteem'd, ‘From Acre's tow'r a standard white on high ‘In token of surrender widely stream'd. ‘Soon as in air we saw the signal fly, ‘Throughout our host arose a wild exulting cry. XCV ‘The trembling Pagans, whom our furious bands ‘Still to the breach with horrid carnage drove, ‘Cast down their arms, and with uplifted hands, ‘With tears and gestures of submission, strove ‘The pity of their gen'rous foe to move. ‘Nor were their tears and supplications vain. ‘While yet I bad them English mercy prove, ‘I saw Lusignan and his splendid train ‘Advancing tow'rds the heights across th' ensanguin'd plain. XCVI ‘Approaching near, he caught me to his breast, ‘And, when at length his words a passage found, ‘He thus the transports of his soul express'd. “Oh far beyond all Christian Kings renown'd! “Conquest and fame thy glorious toils have crown'd! “By thee redeem'd Judæa's cause prevails: “Thee, while her shores with extacy resound, “While her triumphant voice high Heav'n assails, “Her champion she proclaims, her chief she proudly hails! XCVII “To English valour vanquish'd Acre bows, “And with the wreath to Gallia's King denied “The GOD of battles dignifies thy brows. “To win fair fame, to crush the Pagan's pride, “His hand has deign'd thy gallant host to guide: “Inspir'd by thee brave Mortimer maintain'd “His country's old renown, while Leicester wide “On the devoted town his horrors rain'd. “What fate to us refus'd their matchless worth has gain'd. XCVIII “See on those tow'rs, which long the Christian band “Insulting mock'd, the flag of triumph wave, “While Caracos awaits thy high command. “Thy gen'rous mercy he submits to crave: “And from the sword his troops disarm'd to save, “To yield the Cross he proffers, and to pay “A golden ransom for his comrades brave, “Who here as hostages with him shall stay, “'Till to our camp his King our pris'ners shall convey.” XCIX ‘Thus spoke Judæa's Prince.—“To Heav'n alone,” ‘Raptur'd I cried, “be thanks and homage paid! “Our's is the prize, and mercy shall be shewn! “Here let our standard widely be display'd: “Let Saladin behold his glories fade, “And know that Acre from his pow'r is rent!” ‘I said. My comrades my behest obey'd, ‘While with Lusignan tow'rds the royal tent, ‘Where Caracos remain'd, exultingly we went. C ‘But wherefore am I thus compell'd to speak ‘Of deeds which others might more fitly state? ‘Why am I thus with declamation weak ‘Reduc'd my own transactions to narrate? ‘Not to myself impute it, but to fate. ‘Yon Tyrant's odious charges to repel, ‘To save myself from his unpitying hate, ‘Here on my own deserts I needs must dwell, ‘Must my own virtue urge, my own atchievements tell. CI ‘I, who in Palestine rejoic'd to bleed, ‘Where routed Pagans trembled at my name, ‘And crouch'd before me, am condemn'd to plead ‘Like a base slave for liberty and fame. ‘Princes! from you protection let me claim! ‘I see among you many a val'rous Chief, ‘Who erst the partner of my toils became; ‘I see my comrades lov'd, whose gen'rous grief ‘Led them from England's shores, who for their King's relief—’ CII “Oh speak not so! Oh rack not thus my soul!” Cried Mortimer, as starting from his seat, And trembling with disdain which mock'd controul, His tears burst forth: “Blush not his charge to meet; “Let truth the fraudful Tyrant's arts defeat. “Had I the herald of thy praises been, “Had I been charg'd thy actions to repeat, “In tints more vivid, tho' in phrase more mean, “Had thy transcendent worth and constancy been seen! CIII “I, who full often on the bloody field “Have view'd thee, when obdurate fortune frown'd, “'Mid adverse hosts thy pow'rful faulchion wield, “Could amply tell how fled thy foes around: “I could detail, how on th' encrimson'd ground “The gasping Saracens their lives resign'd, “How, when by conquest fann'd, by glory crown'd, “Thy feeling soul on clemency refin'd, “Thy courtesy rejoic'd affliction's wounds to bind. CIV “Did I not share the perils of the war, “When, bruis'd thy helm, thy sword with slaughter red, “Thro' mingled hosts thy voice was heard afar, “When we together for our country bled, “When Pagan armies at thy onset fled, “When fair renown her noblest trophy wove, “And plac'd her deathless laurel on thy head? “And now, oh Heav'n and all ye saints above! “Live I to see my King yon Tyrant's victim prove! CV “He, who, tho' seated on th' imperial throne, “Trembles when thus he sees thee captive stand! “Shame on the Christian world, which thus can own “A mean submission to his base command! “That he, who honour's dictates never scann'd, “Whose fears forbad his dastard soul to taste “The joys sublime which fortitude had plann'd, “Who shunn'd the paths which glory's hand had trac'd, “The sacred shores which erst a Saviour's presence grac'd—” CVI “Cease, Mortimer!” exclaim'd the King, “nor thus “Forget the public servant in the friend. “We must far otherwise this cause discuss. “Should these great Princes patiently attend, “Should they to hear my statements condescend, “I must, however loth, obey their will. “On their unbiass'd judgments I depend: “Tho' worn I feel and spent, their candour still “The task which yet remains will aid me to fulfil.” CVII As thus the Monarch spoke, his varying cheek Now flush'd, now seem'd with faintness pale impress'd; When Brunswick's Duke, who his condition weak Had notic'd, thus th' attentive Peers address'd. “However potently each gen'rous breast “The royal pleader's narrative may fire, “'Twere fitting our proceedings we arrest: “Let the brave captive from the hall retire, “Let him enjoy the rest which nature's calls require. CVIII “Then, when with spirits fresh and force renew'd, “When dawns to-morrow's light, he here shall come, “His interesting tale may be pursued: “Recruited then our task we may resume, “When waken'd judgment may our minds illume, “And calm reflection may our votes direct. “Meantime, while unpronounc'd remains his doom, “Germania's Chiefs the pris'ner shall protect, “And carefully whate'er betides him shall inspect.” CIX He said. The Peers with loud and glad acclaim Their approbation of his vote convey'd. Confus'd the Tyrant sat: the guilt and shame Which rankled in his heart his brow betray'd: Yet, to oppose the gen'ral voice afraid, With well-dissembled courtesy he bent, And, while a smile on his dark visage play'd, Which thinly veil'd his inward discontent, From his high throne he rose, and yielded full assent. END OF BOOK VII. BOOK VIII. ARGUMENT. Re-assembly of the Diet—Richard continues his narrative —Philip's quarrel with the Crusaders—Departure of himself and Conrad—Saladin refuses to perform his engagements, and retreats towards Jaffa—Richard and his army leave Acre, and arrive in the neighbourhood of Cæsarea— He receives intelligence that Saladin was advancing to attack him—He orders his troops to ascend the heights, and draws them up in order of battle. I Now o'er the east the ray of morning beam'd, And soon the glorious sun, his coursers fleet Fresh harnessing, o'er Heav'n's wide surface stream'd. The early Chieftains hasten'd now to meet; And, soon as Henry on his royal seat Resum'd his station, to his former place England's brave King was led. He bow'd, to greet The splendid presence, and, with manly grace, His further warlike feats proceeded thus to trace. II ‘When here before ye, Princes! I appear'd, ‘I told ye how proud Acre we had gain'd, ‘And how, with Judah's King, my steps I steer'd ‘To where the vanquish'd Caracos remain'd. ‘Tho' joyful from the triumphs we obtain'd, ‘Yet thought we of the late disastrous chance, ‘Which Gallia's best and noblest blood had drain'd: ‘Still, as we ey'd the plain with anxious glance, ‘A pitying sigh we breath'd for Philip and for France. III “Oh! that high Heav'n, in mercy to mankind, “War and its deadly scourges had restrain'd! “Oh! had it stamp'd upon the human mind “The mild forbearance, and the love unfeign'd, “By which alone man's blessings are sustain'd, “And conscience loses her severest stings! “Then brother ne'er a brother's blood had drain'd, “Ne'er had we known the dire effect, which springs “From nations' rivalry and jealous hate of kings!” IV ‘Thus I exclaim'd, as from the rampart's height ‘Across the battle's field I bent my course. ‘In ev'ry quarter where I turn'd my sight, ‘Pallid and ghastly lay some bleeding corse, ‘Or groan'd some warrior, waiting the divorce ‘Of all that form'd him dignified and brave: ‘Above them vultures flew with screamings hoarse, ‘While, from their maws obscene the dead to save, ‘Their pious friends prepar'd an undistinguish'd grave. V ‘As with disturb'd and hurried step I pass'd, ‘And still my ling'ring and enquiring eye ‘On every spectacle of misery cast, ‘I heard a feeble and half-utter'd cry, ‘And turning saw a wounded warrior lie, ‘Stretch'd on the plain, his armour red with blood: ‘A dart his breast had pierc'd, while from his thigh, ‘Where still the fragment of a lance I view'd, ‘With fatal course distill'd a deep-empurpled flood. VI ‘I hasten'd tow'rds him. With a trembling hand ‘He rais'd his shatter'd visor, to disclose ‘The well-known countenance of young Ferrand; ‘Then cried, “Ere yet too weak my utt'rance grows, “My fast-decaying senses ere I lose, “Let me again my much-lov'd Sov'reign greet! “Let me with him my dying wish repose! “Then shall my soul to Heav'n's eternal seat “Without a pang depart, it's gracious judge to meet.” VII ‘Then, drawing from his breast a braid of hair, “Before I left,” he cried, “my native shore, “To noble Moubray's daughter, Edith fair, “My plighted vows and lasting faith I swore. “This pledge of love, which next my heart I wore, “For her who gave it, gracious Richard! take: “This to the mistress of my soul restore! “Ah! bid her guard it for her lover's sake, “Whose constancy nor time nor death itself could shake!” VIII “Ferrand!” I cried, as leaning o'er the youth ‘I grasp'd his hand, “with sorrow I receive “This dear memorial of thy gen'rous truth. “Oh! could my pow'r thy gallant soul retrieve, “Thy loss the gentle Edith should not grieve, “Nor should thy King regret a faithful friend! “While o'er thy corse the mould'ring earth shall heave, “A common woe shall both our bosoms rend, “And jointly shall our pray'rs for thee to Heav'n ascend.” IX ‘My words his parting anguish seem'd to calm: ‘A smile of transport beam'd upon his face, ‘As with a gentle touch he press'd my palm; ‘Then gazing upward, as imploring grace, ‘He breath'd a sigh, and sank in death's embrace. ‘I felt his worth my fond attention claim, ‘And gave commandment his remains to place ‘In Acre's holy temple, as became ‘A Chief renown'd for truth and early known to fame. X ‘Now to the tent our footsteps we impell'd, ‘To meet bold Caracos impatient grown: ‘And soon our gallant captive we beheld. ‘Pensive he stood, his eye now casting down, ‘Now viewing mournfully the captur'd town; ‘Then suddenly, as if he fate defied, ‘Our conq'ring host surveying with a frown: ‘While Mortimer and Leicester, at his side, ‘With courteous bearing strove to sooth his wounded pride. XI ‘Approaching towards him with a friendly mien, ‘I thus bespoke him: “In misfortune's hour “A warrior's constancy is chiefly seen. “If in the plenitude of martial pow'r, “And flush'd with full success, his spirits tow'r, “Deceitful is his glory, small his praise: “But, when o'ercharg'd with ill his prospects lour, “If then he learn his stricken soul to raise, “Approving virtue smiles, and Heav'n it's aid displays. XII “What tho' no longer with appropriate state “Thou rul'st yon fortress which our arms have gain'd? “Has not thy bold defence confirm'd thee great? “Do not those ramparts which our toils disdain'd, “Those walls which long our force immense sustain'd, “To thy exalted worth their suffrage bear? “They join to prove thy loyalty unstain'd, “And strongly urge us, with demeanour fair “The ruin of thy hopes and fortunes to repair.” XIII “Prince!” said the Chief, “tho' in my conscious heart “Th' expiring spark of hope no longer glows, “Some consolation still thy words impart. “Thus much at least my soul of comfort knows; “That to no common or ignoble foes “Have I surrender'd up my sacred trust; “That, since fate will'd my efforts to oppose, “I bear the fetters of a Prince august, “Not more supreme in war than in his triumphs just.” XIV ‘Mov'd by the frankness of the vet'ran Chief, ‘I bad th' attendants ev'ry means prepare, ‘To calm his anguish and appease his grief. ‘Then with the Queen and Chariclæa fair, ‘Who from their tent my transports came to share, ‘Tow'rds the proud walls of Acre I advanc'd, ‘Where, as with pomp majestic in the air ‘The lordly ensigns of our island glanc'd, ‘Our victor host with shouts of joy our souls entranc'd. XV ‘Along the well-disputed breach our way ‘To the chief gate exultingly I led, ‘O'er which no longer now, in dire display, ‘Disgusting vestiges of blood were spread: ‘For pious hands already to the dead ‘Had paid the hasty tribute of a grave, ‘And pity's eye her parting tear had shed. ‘As on we pass'd, th' encircling heralds gave ‘Breath to their brazen tubes, and shook heav'n's wide concave. XVI ‘A thousand voices, joining in acclaim, ‘A martial and extatic chorus made, ‘As to Saint John's respected fane we came. ‘There, as religion's dictates we obey'd, ‘And humbly kneeling bounden homage paid, ‘Ermengard and his valiant Knights, no more ‘In gorgeous helms and coats of steel array'd, ‘A solemn mass recited, to adore ‘Th' Eternal King, and His fresh mercies to implore. XVII ‘When thus in man's first duty we had shar'd, ‘We left the newly-consecrated ground, ‘And to Lusignan's splendid hall repair'd. ‘There on his board a banquet rich we found; ‘With the grape's juice our ample goblets crown'd ‘From hand to hand quick circulating pass'd: ‘The voice of harmony was heard around, ‘And, as on me her eyes were fondly cast, ‘My Berengaria's smiles enhanc'd the blest repast. XVIII ‘Still did the minstrel's touch a strain pursue, ‘Such as not Orpheus' self could have excell'd, ‘When suddenly the portals op'ning flew, ‘And Gallia's King approaching we beheld. ‘We hail'd him, but our greeting he repell'd, ‘And wav'd his hand as if inclin'd to speak. ‘Stern was his brow, with rage his bosom swell'd, ‘Tho' still he seem'd from late exertions weak, ‘While a faint tinge of red flush'd o'er his pallid cheek. XIX ‘Him Otho, who the bold Burgundians sway'd, ‘Attended close, with Conrad Prince of Tyre, ‘Suabia's proud Duke, whom Frederick's host obey'd, ‘And Leopold, who since with rankling ire ‘'Gainst me with yonder tyrant dar'd conspire, ‘And here compell'd me for my fame to plead. ‘As on they came, I mark'd the passions dire ‘Which o'er each face their gloomy terrors spread, ‘And in their gestures fierce unbridled wrath I read. XX ‘Nor falsely deem'd I of their stern intent: ‘For Philip now advanc'd before the rest, ‘And as around a scornful glance he sent, ‘Thus rapidly th' assembled Peers address'd. “Princes! at length the treason is confess'd, “And England's King betrays his secret aim! “Of trophies won by gallant France possess'd, “He boasts his guilt, he triumphs in his shame, “And on a treach'ry foul aspires to build his fame. XXI “Shall he—because, upon the field well gain'd “By Gallic valour and my puissant might, “A tame spectator he so long remain'd, “Shall he—because, when won the glorious fight, “He dar'd our compact trait'rously to slight, “And join'd my conq'ring warriors in the chace, “Say, shall he thus my high deserts requite, “Shall he his brows with Gallia's laurels grace, “Shall he on Acre's walls his banners singly place? XXII “And shall he too the ransom full receive “Which for my captives Saladin will pay? “Shall he my army of their rights bereave? “No—ne'er will Philip his just cause betray, “Nor shall a crafty rival hence convey “The blushing honours which his sword acquir'd! “Princes! to you I make appeal. Oh! say, “Are not your breasts with indignation fir'd, “Or have you with my foe against my claims conspir'd? XXIII “Let England's King declare on what pretence “He claims distinction. Is it that engag'd, “By solemn vows in Palestine's defence, “With good Sicilia's Prince he warfare wag'd? “Is it because, this enmity assuag'd, “On hapless Cyprus in accursed hour “He fell, by avarice and revenge enrag'd, “To crush it's throne, it's substance to devour? “Are these the great exploits which prove his martial power? XXIV “Oh that the victims of his guilt were here! “Their grateful voices surely would combine “Full testimony of his worth to bear!—” “To bear such testimony full be mine,” ‘Exclaim'd the Cypriot Prince, as from the line ‘Of list'ning Chiefs he press'd with anxious haste: “Ill can I guess, with what deprav'd design “The daring tongue of calumny has trac'd “A charge, to blast the wreaths which England's Monarch grac'd. XXV “But, if base taunts and obloquy thus flow “From an allied and long-acknowledg'd friend, “Listen while he, who late was Richard's foe, “Stands forth his injur'd honour to defend. “He sought not Cyprus from my power to rend: “My haughty spirit, then by ills unquell'd, “Led me with him unjustly to contend; “My rash aggression bravely he repell'd, “And Isaac's fall, alas! his victor's triumph swell'd. XXVI “'Twas then, when sorely by defeat oppress'd, “His innate magnanimity I view'd: “His matchless worth my conscious soul confess'd; “Tho' still remain'd the mem'ry of our feud, “His courtesy my stubborn pride subdued. “Vanquish'd again by his demeanour fair, “Hither with him my course have I pursued, “Beneath his banner Pagan rage to dare, “With him the toils of war, the sacred cause to share.” XXVII ‘As thus the Prince with gen'rous ardour spoke, ‘Each bosom own'd a consentaneous flame, ‘And from the croud shouts sympathetic broke. ‘Soon as was hush'd their turbulent acclaim, “I do not,” Philip cried, “a captive blame, “Who thus attempts to sooth his master's pride. “Chieftains! from you a full redress I claim: “'Tis your's my just pretensions to decide, “Tho' England's boastful King my merits has denied.” XXVIII ‘Earnest his strange presumption to correct, ‘I turn'd to speak; but, with demeanour kind, ‘Judæa's King my warmth impatient check'd, ‘And thus with mild and temper'd phrase rejoin'd. “We have not, Prince! to wrong your worth combin'd; “To us your high deserts are fully known, “And amply for them is our praise assign'd; “Yet truth impartial bids our voices own, “That much is due to thee, but not to thee alone. XXIX “Amid the perils of the bloody field, “We saw and own'd your eminent desert: “But, when at length to numbers forc'd to yield, “Your hand no more could Judah's cause assert, “'Twas Richard's fate your danger to avert, “To stem the progress of the conq'ring foe. “Ever to aid the Christian cause alert, “His arm the vengeful Tecadin brought low, “And forc'd beneath our pow'r the Saracens to bow.” XXX ‘As when the wind a headstrong current meets, ‘High mount it's waves, and with indignant stroke ‘It's rugged banks the furious torrent beats; ‘So, when with firmness thus Lusignan spoke, ‘Fresh wrath in Philip's struggling breast awoke. “And is it thus,” th' impetuous Monarch cried, “Thou dar'st, usurper false! my rage provoke? “Is it for thee our contest to decide, “Whose weak inglorious hand in combat ne'er was tried? XXXI “No more in glitt'ring arms thy limbs incase, “Cast off thy nodding helm, thy faulchion break, “And honour'd chivalry no more disgrace! “Hence to thy tent! Judæa's throne forsake! “Sit at thy loom, Sybilla's distaff take, “Enjoy her treasures, but forego her realm! “When vengeful Pagans it's foundation shake, “Let Conrad's pow'rful hand direct it's helm, “His rightful sceptre wield, and Saladin o'erwhelm!” XXXII ‘As thus, with furious mien, the Gallic Prince ‘His wrath proclaim'd, the hall with murmurs rung, ‘And every Chieftain, eager to evince ‘The indignation which his bosom stung, ‘Drew forth his sword, and from the table sprung. ‘Godfrey, Thuringia, bold Ferrara's Duke, ‘Ermengard, Harold, and Vervoni young, ‘Rush'd emulous the boaster to rebuke, ‘While with discordant cries the echoing chamber shook. XXXIII ‘Nor seem'd his friends more backward for the fray: ‘With no less clamour round the King they stood, ‘Waving their brands in menacing array. ‘And doubtless soon a dire and fatal feud ‘Between the angry Peers must have ensued, ‘Had I not stept between each adverse band, ‘And, while I loudly check'd their transports rude, ‘And sought attention with an outstretch'd hand, ‘Their senseless fury thus implor'd them to command. XXXIV “Of those who arms assum'd for Judah's sake, “None than myself more truly can lament “That private strife the public weal should shake. “Was it, illustrious Peers! with this intent “We took the Cross and here our travel bent? “Shall those, who prompted by religion's call “From thrones and princely ease themselves have rent, “Heedless of honour, in disgraceful brawl “Thus without cause engage, and thus ignobly fall? XXXV “Then may indeed our vanquish'd foe exult, “Again his banner on these walls erect, “And unimpeach'd our Europe's pow'r insult. “Ah let not thus our cherish'd hopes be wreck'd! “Your calmer judgments will your views direct “To purposes more worthy of applause: “And royal Philip will perchance reflect, “How far becomes his dignity the cause, “In which his sword yet stain'd with Pagan blood he draws. XXXVI “Had he with coolness pleas'd his claims to state, “Ere this his fancied griefs had been dispell'd, “And ne'er had grown this turbulent debate. “No portion of his ransom I've withheld, “Nor has my breast with fancied triumphs swell'd, “That Acre's fall is due to me alone. “Our common efforts ye have all beheld; “Half of the ransom let him call his own, “And with our English flag be Gallia's banners shewn.” XXXVII “Methinks,” cried Suabia, “this proposal fair “By royal Philip should not be refus'd: “Both well deserve, and both the meed should share. “And if, by passion's sudden heat abus'd, “The Gallic King Lusignan has misus'd, “Let him with courtesy redeem the wrong; “Lest deep remembrance of his fame traduc'd, “By secret brooding grown to rancour strong, “Should lead to graver ills, and Judah's woes prolong.” XXXVIII ‘The watchful Peers his prudent sentence pleas'd, ‘And, as their swords they sheath'd, on either side, ‘Their sudden indignation seem'd appeas'd: ‘But Philip vainly sought his rage to hide, ‘And thus, while flash'd his scowling eye, replied. “Since these illustrious Chiefs have deem'd it fair “That Richard should my hard-earn'd spoils divide, “Let him my glory and my conquest share, “Let him, to sooth his pride, my rightful laurels wear. XXXIX “But now, this condescension to requite, “With confidence well-grounded I demand, “Not as a boon, but as my Sov'reign right, “Of the Crusading host the chief command. “For who my high pretensions shall withstand? “Who of ye all to Palestine has brought “So vast a force, so disciplin'd a band? “Who of ye all such deeds of worth has wrought, “Or who so well the foe to feel our pow'r has taught?” XL ‘He said. Throughout a new confusion spread, ‘And indignation sat on ev'ry brow, ‘When young Vervoni, who the Pisans led, ‘Aloud exclaim'd: “Some other titles shew, “Ere thy pretensions futile we allow! “Think'st thou the Chiefs, who here assembled meet, “To arrogance like thine will tamely bow? “Of hop'st thou, Prince! that humbly at thy feet, “Like vassals they will crouch, thy favour to intreat? XLI “No! when we chuse the leader of our host, “Let sterling merit our decision guide, “And not an empty and vain-glorious boast. “Let sound experience o'er our votes preside, “Let truth prevail, and gratitude decide. “England's brave Monarch has alone a claim “To lead our bands: in perils often tried, “Deeds of transcendent worth have stamp'd his name, “And vict'ry grac'd his brows with wreaths of deathless fame. XLII ‘Not otherwise than when a master's hand ‘From the loud organ draws his leading sound, ‘Obedient follows his responsive band, ‘And, as he winds his rich harmonious round, ‘The list'ning soul in extacy is bound: ‘So, when his fervid thoughts Vervoni spoke, ‘A kindling ardour seem'd to spread around; ‘In ev'ry breast an impulse new awoke, ‘And consentaneous shouts throughout th' assembly broke. XLIII ‘Soon as the burst of acclamation ceas'd, ‘And thro' the hall the loud exulting strain ‘Of gen'ral approbation was appeas'd, ‘The Gallic King, unable to contain ‘The strong emotions of his fierce disdain, ‘Thus with indignant mien the Peers address'd! “Too great to bow, too noble to complain, “I wish not long your patience to arrest; “My fix'd resolve may soon and briefly be express'd. XLIV “Princes! what now has pass'd has fully prov'd “The servile motives which your counsels mark: “The flimsy veil which cloak'd them is remov'd, “And now they shew perfidious, mean and dark. “Attend, and Philip's purpose firm remark. “He leaves you to enjoy your worthy choice: “For better climes he hastens to embark, “And feels his breast, as if redeem'd, rejoice “That his renown no more depends upon your voice.” XLV ‘Thus, as with wrath his panting bosom burn'd, ‘The Gallic Monarch spoke, and tow'rds the door, ‘Awaiting no reply, he proudly turn'd. ‘But, ere he reach'd it, anxious to restore ‘Our interrupted union, and once more ‘To calm his fury and our breach to close, ‘I cried, “Your passage from Judæa's shore, “Forgive me, Royal Sir! if I oppose, “And urge you, to unite against our common foes. XLVI “Let not th' impression of a hasty phrase, “The warm and partial tribute of a friend, “Perhaps too rashly paid, your vengeance raise; “Nor, if a sudden violence offend, “To our great cause it's dire effects extend. “Recal the moment, when, at Vergelay, “We swore these holy regions to defend, “To vindicate this land from lawless sway, “And for religion's sake our banners to display. XLVII “To this engagement, register'd above, “My faithful spirit is obedient still, “And seeks no other object, than to prove “How well my actions may my oath fulfil. “Conscious of thy deserts and martial skill, “To own thy pow'r supreme prepar'd I stand, “And like the rest, obedient to thy will, “T'exalt the glories of thy high command, “Confirm the Christian hopes, and save this injur'd land.” XLVIII ‘Thus earnestly I spoke. The King awhile ‘My countenance with feelings mark'd survey'd; ‘Then, as across his visage stern a smile ‘Of mingled scorn and indignation play'd, ‘Which too distinctly his revenge betray'd, ‘With haughty and repulsive tone replied. “Think not my settled purpose to evade: “Vainly you strive malignity to hide, “And vain your weak attempt my future plans to guide. XLIX “My firm resolve admits not of reply. “From Acre's port and this perfidious coast, “Soon as to-morrow's sun shall gild the sky, “Tow'rds France shall sail my ill-requited host. “Yet, still observant when insulted most, “With twice five thousand troops I Otho leave, “On whom your trust may safely be repos'd. “This as the sum of my intent receive: “For nought my destin'd course can alter or reprieve.” L “Philip!” I answer'd, “since the public good “Than private int'rest less affects thy mind, “By me no more thy will shall be withstood. “But let this last request acceptance find. “Before high Heav'n again thy conscience bind, “Not to attempt by force or fraud to gain, “In contravention of the league we sign'd, “My realm of England, or the wide domain “Which in thy native France dependent I retain.” LI ‘As thus I urg'd him, starting and aghast ‘He wildly ey'd me, while as if of shame ‘O'er his pale cheek a deep suffusion pass'd; ‘Then quickly cried, “Debaser of my fame! “To Heav'n and man I thus my oath proclaim! “If I in ought with England's foes combine, “If to affect thy kingdom's weal I aim, “Or 'gainst thy int'rests ought of wrong design, “May Heav'n's eternal curse and infamy be mine! LII ‘While from his lips the imprecation pass'd, ‘Methought his limbs with trepidation shook, ‘And earnestly across the void he cast ‘With haggard glance an agitated look; ‘The sudden blush it's seat usurp'd forsook, ‘And madd'ning phrenzy seem'd to rack his soul. ‘As from Lusignan's hall his way he took, ‘O'er night's dark veil a gleam sulphureous stole, ‘And on our left we heard the sullen thunder roll: LIII ‘And ever and anon a fearful shriek, ‘As if from suff'rance wrung, thro' the thick air ‘With energy which rent the soul would break; ‘And forth would burst sad accents of despair, ‘Whose thrilling tones the boldest hearts might scare, ‘Might freeze the blood, and valour's impulse quell. ‘Imagination, piercing thro' the glare, ‘Form'd images of fiends and dæmons fell, ‘Hov'ring amid the gloom, and scatt'ring many a spell. LIV ‘Thus horribly, 'midst terror and dismay, ‘Pass'd the portentous and appalling night. ‘Soon as the cloud dispersing orb of day, ‘Fresh from the waves, o'er craggy Turo's height ‘Shot on our camp his coruscation bright, ‘On board his fleet, drawn up in order due, ‘The Gallic King embark'd with many a knight. ‘Calm was the ocean, fav'ring breezes blew, ‘And soon to Judah's coast they bad a last adieu. LV ‘Still as, their course pursuing, o'er the main ‘Silent and sad we cast our wistful eyes, ‘Our deep regret unable to restrain, ‘Fortune, which oft the constant spirit tries, ‘And shades our prospects as they flatt'ring rise, ‘A new and unexpected ill had plann'd: ‘For Conrad now threw off his base disguise, ‘And, leading from our camp his Tyrian band, ‘Bad them ascend his fleet which anchor'd on the strand. LVI ‘To the throng'd port our steps we quickly bent, ‘And earnestly implor'd the Chief to say, ‘Whence rose his grievance, and with what intent ‘He thus prepar'd to draw his force away. “The wrongs of France,” he cried, “forbid my stay: “From those who 'gainst my great ally conspire, “And with ingratitude his aid repay, “Honour, revenge, and gen'rous zeal require “That, ere he share their guilt, Montferrat should retire. LVII “Nor have you injur'd less my lawful claim. “Judæa's sceptre, which, when Sybill died, “To me in right of Isabella came, “By your unjust decree has been denied. “Tho' you may stoop to sooth Lusignan's pride, “Such servile baseness is to me unknown, “Nor shall your will our contest high decide. “Ne'er shall my standard on these coasts be shewn, “'Till in imperial pomp it decorate my throne!” LVIII ‘As thus his treasons frontless he avow'd ‘And dar'd our vengeance, thro' our host arose ‘Indignant shouts and exclamations loud: ‘And now they rush'd his passage to oppose, ‘When, earnest the unworthy strife to close, ‘I thus address'd them: “An insidious friend, “When once reveal'd, 'tis fortunate to lose, “Lest, while on specious seemings we depend, “In disappointment sore our best designs may end. LIX “Attempt not then Montferrat to detain: “Allow the recreant Chieftain to depart, “Stain'd by his crimes, and mark'd with your disdain. “Deep in his false and irreligious heart “Upbraiding conscience will infix her dart: “While from her influence vainly he shall fly, “You, unaffected by his trait'rous art, “With duty and religion's call comply, “And on the aid of Heav'n with confidence rely. LX ‘The Chiefs, obedient to my word, withdrew, ‘And left the Prince, insensible to fame, ‘His course from Acre's harbour to pursue, ‘Cloath'd with dishonour, stigmatiz'd with blame, ‘And foully branded with eternal shame. ‘Meantime our camp we hastily regain'd, ‘And, by a herald, forthwith sent to claim ‘From Saladin the Cross our swords obtain'd, ‘The ransom, and the troops who pris'ners yet remain'd. LXI ‘But here, still victims to the arts of Hell, ‘Fresh disappointment were we doom'd to meet. ‘With what had lately pass'd acquainted well, ‘The King refus'd our compact to complete. “Let Europe's bands from Palestine retreat,” ‘He cried: “tho' now their boastful ensigns wave, “Shortly shall end their triumphs in defeat. “Let them beware how Asia's power they brave, “And by obedience prompt their host from vengeance save.” LXII ‘Dissembling thus his purposes unsound, ‘He bad our herald back his steps direct. ‘But his intention speedily we found. ‘For, anxious all his forces to collect, ‘T'impede our course, and Solyma protect, ‘Where all his booty and his wealth were plac'd, ‘And fearful lest his progress might be check'd, ‘From Mahumeria he decamp'd in haste, ‘And, crossing Belus' stream, his route tow'rds Jaffa trac'd. LXIII ‘As now on me devolv'd the sacred trust ‘Our force confed'rate 'gainst the foe to lead, ‘What best became our int'rests I discuss'd, ‘And, by the council of our Chiefs, decreed ‘Without delay from Acre to proceed. ‘For now my troops of nought but conquest dream'd: ‘Panting for fame, and deck'd with glory's meed, ‘While still they gaz'd on Acre's towers redeem'd, ‘Themselves in Judah's cause resistless they esteem'd. LXIV ‘And well their numbers and their martial skill ‘Such fervent expectations might excite, ‘And in their bosoms confidence instil, ‘Tho' robb'd of Philip's and Montferrat's might. ‘My hardy Englishmen, with spirits light, ‘And mindful of their ancestors renown'd, ‘I order'd forth, and station'd on the right, ‘And bad them, when the trumpet's note should sound, ‘To lead our march and still in danger's front be found. LXV ‘To keep the fortress which our recent toils ‘From Asia's Sov'reign valiantly had gain'd, ‘And guard th' unransom'd captives and our spoils, ‘Lusignan and Thuringia's Lord remain'd. ‘There my lov'd Queen fain would I have detain'd: ‘But, hanging on me with a winning grace, ‘So tenderly of parting she complain'd, ‘That I permitted her with me to trace ‘The rugged path of war, and share in glory's race. LXVI ‘First in the ranks the Cypriot Prince appear'd: ‘Array'd in arms of proof and cuirass steel'd, ‘His mace he brandish'd and his banner rear'd. ‘Nor less his daughter grac'd the martial field: ‘Like Grecian Pallas arm'd, she grasp'd a shield; ‘A jav'lin light she pois'd; her brow so fair ‘A casque, surcharg'd with snow-white plumes, conceal'd; ‘While, o'er her polish'd neck, her auburn hair ‘Descended low and wav'd luxuriant in the air. LXVII ‘As with her matchless grace and beauty charm'd ‘Our warriors gaz'd, I ask'd the blushing maid ‘Why thus in steel her tender limbs she arm'd. “While Europe's Chiefs are martially array'd,” ‘Smiling she cried, “I bring my puissant aid, “And 'gainst the Pagans league my peerless might.” ‘Then, taking Berengaria's hand, she said, “In her defence I dare the per'lous fight, “And proudly stile myself her Champion and her Knight.” LXVIII ‘As thus she spoke, throughout our legions ran ‘Approving murmurs. By my Queen embrac'd ‘She join'd her side, and we our march began. ‘Along the sea-girt shore our way we trac'd, ‘Where craggy rocks, in wild disorder plac'd, ‘Frown'd o'er the deep and mock'd the raging tide. ‘Thro' Belus' clear and rapid stream we pass'd, ‘Whose wond'rous sands to Venice first supplied ‘Her mirrors fam'd, and spread her matchless fabrics wide. LXIX ‘Then Zabulon, no more renown'd, we saw, ‘And Caiphas, distinguish'd by the name ‘Of him who once pronounc'd the Jewish law. ‘We left them both, and to Mount Carmel came, ‘Where erst the blest Elijah stamp'd with shame ‘The prophets who their Baal foul ador'd: ‘There he invok'd from Heav'n th' avenging flame, ‘O'erthrew their fanes, destroy'd their rites abhorr'd, ‘And to their King abash'd proclaim'd th' Almighty Lord. LXX ‘Next Ador's sea-girt ramparts caught our sight, ‘Which, when the sons of holy Israel first ‘The valiant Joshua led, he gain'd in fight. ‘Fall'n was it's glory now, it's tow'rs revers'd, ‘It's temples gone, it's multitudes dispers'd. ‘Then Cæsarea's ramparts we survey'd, ‘Where, when with flatt'ry base and zeal accurs'd, ‘Honours divine to Herod fierce were paid, ‘The bolt of Heaven in dust the impious tyrant laid. LXXI ‘But tho' thus far our progress we impell'd, ‘Not unmolested was our suff'ring host. ‘In ev'ry quarter we the foe beheld, ‘Now on the mountain's brow in order clos'd, ‘Now, taking in the close defiles their post, ‘Or lurking 'mid the woods in ambuscade: ‘While we, to risk on ev'ry hand expos'd, ‘Our vent'rous march with toil and peril made, ‘By open force assail'd, by stratagems betray'd. LXXII ‘Along the shore, which trended on our right, ‘We deem'd it most secure our way to keep. ‘Yet vain our efforts. Still by day and night, ‘From the recesses of the craggy steep ‘Which rose around us, with incursive sweep ‘Our watchful and insidious foes would burst, ‘Or thro' th' entangled brakes would silent creep, ‘Where they, unseen, with destination curs'd ‘Amidst our crouded bands their fatal shafts dispers'd. LXXIII ‘For tho', when coping in an equal field, ‘We well might hope the 'vantage to obtain, ‘Yet from their force, in covert thus conceal'd, ‘And unremittingly employ'd, in vain ‘Or shelter or defence we sought to gain. ‘For all the districts far around they knew, ‘Where best their order'd legions might remain, ‘Where they might meet our columns, where pursue, ‘And where secure from harm might lurk their vagrant crew. LXXIV ‘But chiefly, from Arabia's desert brought, ‘The wild Bedouins on their coursers fleet ‘Destruction on our host and terror wrought: ‘For rapidly our progress they would meet, ‘Launce their long darts, and hastily retreat. ‘Not otherwise than when a buzzing fly, ‘Often repuls'd, his trespass will repeat, ‘Unwearied still his circling course will ply, ‘And to infix his sting unceasingly will try. LXXV ‘Thus, harrass'd by the foe, of rest depriv'd, ‘And weaken'd by fatigue and heat, my band ‘To Cæsarea's farther bounds arriv'd. ‘Rude was the country's face: on either hand ‘A range of barren hills was seen to stand, ‘Skirting a wide uncultivated plain; ‘While shelving on the right appear'd the strand, ‘Narrow and rough, o'er which the foaming main, ‘When rag'd the western wind, oft spread it's furious reign. LXXVI ‘Along the eastern lofty range was spread ‘The Saracenic force: their banners high ‘Wav'd num'rous in the air, while loud and dread ‘In fearful chorus rose their boastful cry. ‘Array'd they stood our progress to defy, ‘Which thro' the vale thus thickly guarded lay. ‘We saw their purpose, and resolv'd to try ‘Across the narrow strand to force our way, ‘Ere passing o'er the hills our progress they might stay. LXXVII ‘Approaching night befriended our design. ‘Soon as her shadows o'er the world were cast, ‘Beneath the western rocks I led my line. ‘There silently along the shore we pass'd, ‘And hop'd, as onward we proceeded fast, ‘To reach Capharnaum, and our toils to close. ‘When, suddenly, my trusty spies aghast ‘And breathless came, announcing that our foes ‘In long array advanc'd our travel to oppose. LXXVIII ‘Of all the danger we should run aware ‘If they to cross the mountains should prevail, ‘I instant orders issued, to prepare ‘Forthwith the heights precipitous to scale. ‘My gallant comrades, eager to assail ‘Their cruel foe, and negligent of pain, ‘Obey'd my word. Nor arms, nor weighty mail, ‘Nor the steep crags their ardour could restrain. ‘Surmounting all they strove the summit to attain. LXXIX ‘Safely they gain'd the hazardous ascent, ‘As first the sun disclos'd his dawning light, ‘And o'er high Heav'n his ray reviving sent. ‘Far stretching o'er the plain, in armour bright, ‘And proud display, appear'd the Pagan might. ‘Straight 'gan our order'd host their swords unsheath: ‘Eager for fame, and ardent for the fight, ‘They stood embattled, 'till the trumpet's breath ‘Should sound the bloody blast to victory or to death.

Richard continues his narrative—Battle of Cæsarea— Death of Isaac—Rout of the Saracens—Richard continues his march to Ascalon—The shade of his Father announces to him the defection of his Allies and Philip's treachery— Contention between Richard and Leopold. I ‘The foe in sight, 'twas now my task to plan ‘The order of attack. The Templars bold ‘Form'd with St. John's illustrious Knights our van. ‘Renown'd Druell and brave D'Avesnes I told ‘My Poitevin and Norman flags t'unfold, ‘And pointedly to each his charge assign'd. ‘The English host my standard wide unroll'd; ‘With them the Pisans, French, and Austrians join'd, ‘And with confed'rate ranks our battle's force combin'd. II ‘Soon as I saw our varied banners wave, ‘I bad the soul-inspiring trumpet sound, ‘And to commence the march my order gave. ‘Across the plain which the rude mountain crown'd, ‘In solemn state their course our warriors wound, ‘With step assur'd and countenance serene. ‘Meantime, along the vale and hills around, ‘The Pagan forces far dispers'd were seen, ‘Their busy Chiefs employ'd their legions to convene. III ‘Before the foe surpriz'd their front could change, ‘And, ere acquainted with our new intent, ‘To meet our plans their pow'rs they could arrange, ‘To charge them boldly down the steep descent ‘Our gen'rous host their rapid footsteps bent. ‘As in the Alps, when wintry tempests blanch ‘The icy fields, and forcibly is rent ‘From some lone crag the menacing Avlanche, ‘Thund'ring it seeks the plain destruction wide to launch: IV ‘So rush'd our dauntless heroes from the height, ‘And 'mid the countless legions of the foe ‘Bore their tremendous and resistless might. ‘Still does my heart with admiration glow, ‘When mem'ry, pleas'd their deeds of worth to shew, ‘Recals th' atchievements of our valiant host, ‘The bloody torrents which they caus'd to flow, ‘Their matchless prowess, their exulting boast, ‘Mix'd with the fearful shrieks of many a parting ghost. V ‘First on their right, spurring their coursers fleet, ‘The Hospitallers bold, with rested spear, ‘Rush'd o'er the field the Saracens to meet. ‘Them led Ermengard and the brave Garnier, ‘While stout Des Carres, and many a war-tried Peer, ‘In gallant rivalship their force display'd. ‘Where'er they join'd their rude attack to bear, ‘Their way o'er mingled heaps of dead they made, ‘And Syria's noblest sons a common fate obey'd. VI ‘Nor, with less certain vengeance, on their left, ‘Were Nubia's sable crew of life and fame ‘By Biddesford and his Templar Knights bereft. ‘Where'er like light'ning terrible they came, ‘Their stroke impetuous and unerring aim ‘With devastation seem'd and ruin fraught. ‘Vainly the foe invok'd their Prophet's name: ‘Ere yet complete the pray'r, their spirits sought ‘The grosly-pictur'd bliss which Mahomet had taught. VII ‘While thus on either wing our force prevail'd, ‘With equal zeal, but less assur'd success, ‘Our line the centre of the foe assail'd. ‘How shall I tell the valour and address, ‘With which each Chieftain forward sought to press, ‘And break the phalanx which oppos'd his way? ‘Admiring worlds their prowess might confess, ‘And Heav'n with bliss eternal will repay ‘The Champions of the Cross who perish'd on that day. VIII ‘Against th' Egyptian armament De Dreux ‘Led on the French, who on Judæa's strand ‘Were left the holy warfare to pursue. ‘With them united march'd Burgundia's band, ‘Who with De Vescy had their movements plann'd, ‘And left to him the guidance of the war. ‘His merits justified his high command; ‘For his atchievements fame had blazon'd far, ‘And honour grac'd his front with many a deep-drawn scar. IX ‘Awhile the tawny and presumptuous foes, ‘In numbers confident, their post maintain'd, ‘And Europe's vet'ran Chieftains dared oppose. ‘But quickly were they to retire constrain'd: ‘For soon De Vescy an advantage gain'd ‘Where least his charge they fear'd, and, while De Dreux, ‘Barring all succour, in array remain'd, ‘The bold Burgundians ceas'd not to pursue, ‘And chas'd them o'er the plain in either army's view. X ‘My English warriors Leicester's Earl led on, ‘Where strong embattled Rersia's host he view'd, ‘Whose varied arms with gold and jewels shone: ‘Them he encounter'd with aggression rude. ‘Full hardily his onset they withstood, ‘For well they knew their faulchions keen to wield; ‘And oft the dubious contest was renew'd. ‘At length, to pow'r superior forc'd to yield, ‘With dignified retreat they left the bloody field. XI ‘While glory's impulse fill'd his youthful breast, ‘Vervoni with Melcalez' host engag'd. ‘Onward, as danger seem'd to court, he press'd, ‘And, where the battle's fury chiefly rag'd, ‘He urg'd his course with vengeance unassuag'd. ‘Not long in firm array the foe remain'd: ‘As unappall'd the conflict dire they wag'd, ‘The well-fought field Arabian blood distain'd, ‘And with ascendance dire despair and horror reign'd. XII ‘Not far remote, amid the hostile band ‘The bold Druell his wonders wrought around, ‘'Till by the stern Kahadim's pow'rful hand ‘He fell, alike in life and death renown'd, ‘But soon his shade a fit avenger found: ‘Lestang burst thro' the intervening rank, ‘And struck the Pagan lifeless to the ground. ‘His arms resounded as to earth he sank, ‘And deep his purple gore the thirsty herbage drank. XIII ‘With the fierce Turcomans the Norman might ‘Awhile disputed the far-crimson'd plain, ‘'Till fortune turn'd the balance of the fight. ‘Against Bellegemin the brave D'Avesnes ‘His oft-tried faulchion now employ'd in vain: ‘To Heav'n his pure and gen'rous spirit flew. ‘While friendship here it's influence shall retain, ‘My heart his dear remembrance shall renew, ‘Just to his high desert, to all his virtues true. XIV ‘Soon as their leader fell, his trembling host, ‘Impress'd with wild alarm and sudden dread, ‘As if with him their only hope were lost, ‘Shrank from the perils which around them spread, ‘And o'er the valley in confusion fled. ‘Them vainly Vernon, De la Roche, St. Paul, ‘Besought to turn: to fame and honour dead, ‘No more they own'd the animating call, ‘Tho' doom'd disgrac'd to live, or stigmatiz'd to fall. XV ‘When Saladin, who from a neighb'ring height ‘With anxious eye survey'd the field, perceiv'd ‘Their base desertion and opprobrious flight, ‘His anxious bosom, from despair repriev'd, ‘With hopes of new success and conquest heav'd. ‘He bad Miralis brave, his princely heir, ‘Ere yet the task of carnage were atchiev'd, ‘To fierce Bellegemin his succour bear, ‘His glorious toil partake, his bloody laurels share. XVI ‘Prompt to obey the youthful Chieftain flew. ‘Falkedin join'd his legions to arouse, ‘And summon them the Christians to pursue. ‘He from the Sultan's daughter, his fair spouse, ‘When fresh their loves and recent yet their vows, ‘Himself in search of glory lately tore: ‘Ne'er to revisit his paternal house, ‘His bride, his infant son to see no more, ‘But doom'd a corse to lie on Judah's distant shore. XVII ‘From the surmounting eminence they rush'd, ‘And soon with energetic speed they came, ‘To where the Turcomans, with victory flush'd, ‘The Normans chas'd, who, negligent of fame, ‘Disgrac'd the old distinction of their name. ‘Their swift pursuit the royal Chieftains join'd; ‘And now, like wither'd reeds before the flame, ‘The dastards sank beneath their force combin'd, ‘And to remorseless fate their wretched souls resign'd. XVIII ‘His steed Falkedin urg'd amid the croud, ‘And with his stroke crush'd many a nodding crest, ‘And many a Christian Chief before him bow'd. ‘His spear of toughest ash he fix'd in rest, ‘And with dread impulse thro' their squadrons press'd; ‘Not otherwise than when an eastern blast ‘Sweeps o'er the fields by bounteous nature bless'd, ‘The ruin'd peasants, trembling and aghast, ‘Trace in their blacken'd corn where late the meteor pass'd. XIX ‘As, while his sheep just issuing from the fold ‘Crop the still dewy grass, some shepherd swain ‘Perceives a rav'ning wolf with hunger bold ‘Seize on his fleecy care, and the green plain, ‘Where erst they safely stray'd, with blood distain, ‘His crook he seizes, and with vengeful hand ‘Advances the invader to restrain: ‘So Vernon, when Falkedin urg'd his band, ‘Rush'd with intrepid heart his fury to withstand. XX ‘He met the youthful Prince in full career, ‘And on his shield, emboss'd and polish'd high, ‘With vig'rous onset drove his quiv'ring spear: ‘As thro' each fold he made the weapon fly, ‘Grazing it pass'd along his sinewy thigh. ‘Th' indignant Chief, with no less fell intent, ‘His lance on Vernon's cuirass aim'd t'apply; ‘But striking on the temper'd steel it bent, ‘And, glancing off, his scarf with gold embroider'd rent. XXI ‘Soon as the impulse of their steeds they check'd, ‘As if with one consent each vengeful Knight ‘Turn'd 'gainst his foe his fury to direct. ‘More sure was now the issue of their fight. ‘Impetuous Vernon, summoning his might, ‘Transfix'd Falkedin's breast, and to the ground ‘Headlong impell'd him. In eternal night ‘His dark eyes clos'd, and from his gaping wound ‘Flow'd in a purple stream his gen'rous blood around. XXII ‘Miralis saw him fall: his courser proud ‘He spurr'd impatient 'gainst the Christian Chief, ‘And thus, inflam'd with rage, exclaim'd aloud. “Whoe'er thou art, thy triumph shall be brief! “Not surer falls to earth th' autumnal leaf, “Than thou the forfeit of thy life shall yield, “And satisfy my vengeance and my grief!” ‘With that he struck so stoutly on his shield, ‘That with the sudden shock the Norman leader reel'd. XXIII ‘Rous'd from the torpor which his sense entranc'd, ‘Vernon with well-pois'd lance his foe defied, ‘And tow'rds him inauspiciously advanc'd: ‘For Egypt's Prince so well his beam applied, ‘That deep it enter'd in his mailed side, ‘And roughly drove him wounded to the plain; ‘While, as he fell, his weapon swerving wide ‘Miralis' courser struck and pierc'd his brain. ‘Madly he plung'd awhile, then sank convuls'd with pain. XXIV ‘Himself the youthful Prince soon disengag'd, ‘And, unaffected by his fall, arose, ‘And rush'd on Vernon, doubly now enrag'd. ‘But vainly sought he with the Chief to close; ‘For brave St. Waleric, who amid the foes ‘That day had prov'd the terror of his arm, ‘On his broad shield receiv'd his weighty blows. ‘Perceiving Vernon's risk, in friendship warm ‘He flew across the field to ward th' impending harm. XXV ‘Now rag'd the perilous fight, when De la Roche ‘And stout St. Paul, who long'd their zeal to prove, ‘Thro' the disbanded ranks were seen t'approach. ‘St. Waleric urg'd them by their antient love ‘His bleeding friend from danger to remove, ‘And safely bear him to some sapient leech. “While thus the precious moments you improve,” ‘He cried, “no foe your efforts shall impeach, ‘Nor shall this Pagan's sword my suff'ring comrade reach.” XXVI ‘He said. The willing Chiefs his word obey'd: ‘They rais'd the fainting warrior from the field, ‘And him with care upon the buckler laid, ‘Which late he knew so potently to wield. ‘Meantime, St. Waleric all his powers reveal'd; ‘For 'gainst him now a host of foes conspir'd, ‘And on his helm with vengeful fury peal'd, ‘To aid their Monarch's son with ardour fir'd: ‘He dar'd their onset fierce, nor from their wrath retir'd. XXVII ‘While doubtful seem'd the conflict to remain, ‘And while St. Paul, who now their purpose view'd, ‘Advanc'd in haste St. Waleric to sustain, ‘And thro' th' Egyptian host his passage hew'd, ‘The Persian Safadin his charge renew'd: ‘For stern Bellegemin the Norman band, ‘Now scatter'd o'er the plain, no more pursued, ‘But, flying to support him, gave command ‘Fortune again to try, and Leicester to withstand. XXVIII ‘As when with jav'lins arm'd and spears of proof ‘A lordly lion Nubia's sons surround, ‘Urging their eager hounds, he stands aloof, ‘And makes the forest with his roar resound; ‘If, while the thickets echo far around, ‘His savage consort issues from the wood, ‘Against their foes they turn with deadly bound; ‘Jointly they charge, and with encounter rude ‘Rage 'mid the hostile band and dye the plain with blood: XXIX ‘So, when aloud the Turcomanian Prince ‘With potent voice proclaim'd his high behest, ‘The Persians sought their ardour to evince, ‘And Safadin, again his crimson'd crest ‘Erecting high, against the English press'd. ‘His num'rous host, who our superior might ‘With dread and apprehension had confess'd, ‘Now re-inforc'd check'd their inglorious flight, ‘And fill'd with freshen'd hopes renew'd th' eventful fight. XXX ‘From either side arose a mingled cry, ‘Which now denoted joy, now grief bespoke, ‘And 'mid the clash of arms ascended high. ‘It reach'd Miralis, as with pow'rful stroke ‘He urg'd our host, and in his soul awoke ‘At once dismay and expectation new. “Hark!” he exclaim'd, “our friends our aid invoke, “Fresh scenes of glory open to our view: “Let us obey the call, and victory's course pursue! XXXI ‘He said, and, vaulting on brave Vernon's steed, ‘He left St. Waleric, raging now in vain, ‘And led his squadron on with vengeful speed. ‘Swift as the wind they spurr'd across the plain, ‘And on our English warriors rush'd amain, ‘Where seem'd their ranks in closest order pent: ‘While Saladin, advantage still to gain, ‘A hardy band of wild Bedouins sent, ‘Who hov'ring on their flanks their bows unerring bent. XXXII ‘Now with new fury rag'd the doubtful fight: ‘For life and fame the adverse armies fought. ‘Then gallant Leicester prov'd his vet'ran might: ‘The foremost Chieftains of the foe he sought, ‘And deeds of knightly hardihood he wrought. ‘Intrepid Mortimer his worth display'd: ‘As if the stroke of fate he heeded nought, ‘Where'er the Pagans swarm'd his course he made, ‘And deeply with their blood was mark'd his trenchant blade. XXXIII ‘But tho' thus mindful of their old renown ‘With bleeding Saracens the field they strew'd, ‘Fortune appear'd on English zeal to frown. ‘In every quarter, as intent I view'd, ‘I saw that Saladin his ranks renew'd, ‘With warriors fresh and eager for the fray. ‘Their quick succession and their onset rude ‘Compell'd our wearied legions to give way: ‘Backward they drew, but still preserv'd their firm array. XXXIV ‘I turn'd to Henry, Count of fair Champaigne, ‘My much lov'd sister's son, and bad him haste ‘With his good troop our battle to sustain. ‘Quickly his host in order due he plac'd, ‘And 'cross the plain his rapid movement trac'd. ‘Meantime, while these their preparation made, ‘The Cypriot Prince his burnish'd helmet brac'd, ‘Caught his broad shield, aloft his mace display'd, ‘And vaulting on his steed with hurried accents said: XXXV “Richard! to Heaven my fervent thanks arise, “Which now, to prove my late professions true, “A fit occasion to my zeal supplies! “How I esteem thee let my actions shew! “Perhaps for ever, gallant King! adieu!” ‘He said. Like light'ning bursting from a cloud, ‘Urging his courser fleet the hero flew, ‘To where Bellegemin with menace proud ‘Against the Christian bands extermination vow'd. XXXVI ‘Still did my eyes pursue th' intrepid Chief, ‘As on his course he held, when, on my right, ‘A shriek was heard of horror and of grief. ‘Young Chariclæa, who beheld the sight ‘Which fill'd her feeling soul with wild affright, ‘Forgetful of herself, and urg'd by love, ‘Impell'd her palfrey, shook her jav'lin light, ‘And down the steep with madd'ning impulse drove, ‘Straight to the spot where now her Sire with Pagans strove. XXXVII “Oh save her! save her!” cried my weeping Queen, “Is there no valiant Knight, whose pow'rful arm “Will guard her from the Pagans' weapons keen, “And shield her beauties from impending harm?” ‘Instant unnumber'd Chiefs, with courage warm, ‘Proffer'd my Consort's terrors to dispel, ‘And aid the Princess 'mid the dread alarm: ‘But, rushing 'fore them all, the young Blondel ‘Impatiently exclaim'd, as at my feet he fell, XXXVIII “Oh Prince! if e'er thy favour I possess'd, “Grant me the boon which now I humbly crave! “On me, on me, confer the sacred quest, “The glorious priv'lege, from the threat'ning grave “This paragon of female worth to save! “My kindling soul expands at beauty's call! “And, tho' no banner here I proudly wave, “In her defence no perils can appal! “Let her but live, and I with honour crown'd shall fall!” XXXIX “Blondel!” I cried, “thy passing worth I know: “Be thine the task to guard the peerless maid, “And bear her safely from th' infuriate foe. “God and St. George protect my friend!”—I said: ‘Nor long th' impassion'd youth his course delay'd, ‘But o'er th' ensanguin'd field his progress bent, ‘Where unmatch'd valour Leicester still display'd, ‘And where Bellegemin, with fell intent, ‘Against our straighten'd host his fresh detachments sent. XL ‘Him the undaunted Cypriot Prince perceiv'd, ‘Hot with repeated toil, with blood distain'd, ‘While 'mid the carnage by his arm atchiev'd, ‘Like Thracian Mars by terror led he reign'd. “Thou, who too long with vengeance unrestrain'd “Hast urg'd thy impious warfare,” Isaac cried, “Prepare to yield the 'vantage thou hast gain'd! “Heav'n, which thy tongue blaspheming has defied, “Will nerve my hand it's cause illustrious to decide!” XLI ‘Thus spoke the Chief. Awaiting no reply, ‘Against the Pagan boldly he advanc'd, ‘His mace tremendous brandishing on high. ‘Across his plumed helm the weapon glanc'd, ‘But with such force, that stagg'ring and entranc'd ‘His seat the Turcoman had nearly lost: ‘Before his eyes diverging spectres danc'd, ‘And, as his visual nerve they wildly cross'd, ‘Flashes of vivid fire throughout the gloom were toss'd. XLII ‘The Cypriot Chieftain stopt his courser fleet, ‘And, wheeling round, prepar'd with surer aim ‘His foe, half vanquish'd deem'd, again to meet. ‘But him, still mindful of his ancient fame, ‘And now by great revenge inflam'd and shame, ‘His guardian genius shielded from the stroke: ‘For, as the Prince impetuous onward came, ‘Breathing a prayer his succour to invoke ‘The Pagan rais'd his shield, which with the impulse broke. XLIII ‘With rowels sharp he urg'd his courser's flank, ‘And with loud cry impell'd him 'cross the plain, ‘Which now of mingled slaughter deeply drank, ‘Advantage for his next attack t'obtain. ‘Then in it's rest fixing his spear again, ‘Soon as his fitting distance he discern'd, ‘His speed he check'd, and with a dext'rous rein ‘Back on his following foe his steed he turn'd, ‘While with vindictive ire his soul tumultuous burn'd. XLIV ‘The Cypriot Prince observ'd his coming foe, ‘And, nothing dreading his encounter rude, ‘Aim'd at his head a fulminating blow. ‘But vainly he the Pagan's lance withstood: ‘It pierc'd his manly breast; th' arterial blood ‘Gush'd like a fountain from the ghastly wound; ‘And far extended the encrimson'd flood, ‘As the expiring hero press'd the ground, ‘Glorious in death, as erst for knightly deeds renown'd. XLV ‘The Saracen his broken spear cast by, ‘And grimly smil'd the fallen Chief to view, ‘When tow'rds the spot, with a loud piercing cry ‘And frantic mien, fair Chariclæa drew. ‘Loose in the wind her auburn tresses flew, ‘With fire her eye-balls glanc'd, her cheeks were dy'd ‘With tints more lustrous than the rose's hue, ‘And tears of rage burst forth, as she espied ‘Her much lov'd father's breast stain'd with the bloody tide. XLVI ‘Like Niobe, upon his mangled corse, ‘With sorrow petrified, she gaz'd aghast, ‘Then instantly, with more than female force, ‘Against Bellegemin her dart she cast. ‘With aim unerring the swift weapon pass'd, ‘And in his brawny arm the barbed hook, ‘Tearing the veins and quivering flesh, stuck fast. ‘Ill did the Chief this salutation brook: ‘His frame with madd'ning rage and indignation shook. XLVII ‘Urging his charger, with uplifted blade ‘To strike the damsel furiously he sought, ‘When, on his shield, extended o'er the maid, ‘His weighty blow Blondel observant caught. “Pagan! if warlike fame thou heedest ought,” ‘The gallant youth exclaim'd, “thy wrath command; “From female foes no glory can be wrought: “But, if the proof thou dar'st, lo! here I stand, “Prepar'd to meet the force of thy experienc'd hand.” XLVIII “Stripling!” rejoin'd the Chief, “thy untried sword, “Oppos'd to skill and energy like mine, “But little chance of safety can afford: “'Twere best th' unequal contest to decline, “Ere my prov'd arm correct thy rash design.” “'Tis not for thee, I trust,” exclaim'd Blondel, “The period of my labours to define: “Look to thyself, proud Pagan! guard thee well, “And, if thou lov'st thy life, my firm attack repel!” XLIX ‘He said. As when, on Lybia's arid shore, ‘A tiger springs upon a tim'rous deer, ‘And the wide forest echoes with his roar, ‘If an imperial lion, prowling near, ‘The death-denouncing sound should chance to hear, ‘He rushes forth th' invader bold to meet; ‘The fight begins, their fangs each other tear, ‘While, trembling yet, and with uncertain feet, ‘The rescued victim flies to gain it's old retreat: L ‘With no less fatal and remorseless feud, ‘The rival Champions high their weapons wav'd, ‘And sturdily maintain'd the combat rude. ‘Deeply each helm and mail their swords engrav'd, ‘And bloody streams their hauberks widely lav'd. ‘Astonish'd at the puissance of his foe, ‘The Pagan loudly imprecating rav'd, ‘And oft renew'd his well-directed blow: ‘Nor was the Christian Chief to pour his vengeance slow. LI ‘Uncertain seem'd the dread event to float: ‘For either was in arms instructed well; ‘And, tho' Bellegemin more strongly smote, ‘And boasted greater pow'rs, yet young Blondel, ‘More active his encounter to repel, ‘Far better knew his trusty sword to wield, ‘And, as his foeman's pond'rous faulchion fell, ‘Had learn'd t'oppose his yet unblazon'd shield, ‘Where on the ringing orb with harmless stroke it peal'd. LII ‘Long time their doubtful combat they had wag'd, ‘And many a hardy deed had been atchiev'd, ‘When the stern Pagan, doubly now enrag'd, ‘Collecting all his force his faulchion heav'd. ‘The blow Blondel upon his shield receiv'd, ‘And, ere the Saracen could raise his brand, ‘With puissant stroke his iron mail he cleav'd, ‘And sever'd from his sinewy arm the hand, ‘With which he erst was used his courser to command. LIII ‘He shriek'd with anguish, while his foaming steed, ‘Who now no longer felt the pow'rful rein, ‘By his loud cry alarm'd, with furious speed ‘Bore his unwilling master o'er the plain, ‘Fainting with loss of blood and mad with pain. ‘Close at his heels pursued the brave Blondel: ‘Nor follow'd he the Chieftain maim'd in vain, ‘For at his head he aim'd a blow so well, ‘That, bending from his seat, to earth the Pagan fell. LIV ‘Like some huge oak, uprooted by the wind, ‘As there outstretch'd he lifeless press'd the ground, ‘Blondel repair'd the Cyprian maid to find. ‘Her kneeling by her father's corse he found, ‘While on his bleeding breast and ghastly wound, ‘From her sad eyes distill'd a briny flood. ‘The zone which girt her waist she had unbound, ‘With which she strove to wipe away the blood, ‘Which, flowing now no more, congeal'd and mantling stood. LV ‘Softly a few consoling words he spoke; ‘But, as he strove to cheer the weeping fair, ‘Fresh agony his tenderness awoke. “Oh gen'rous youth!” she cried, “com'st thou to share “My madd'ning grief and exquisite despair? “If e'er compassion could thy spirit move, “Aid me my father's body hence to bear! “This last, dear consolation grant, to prove “My fervent, tho' alas! my unavailing love!” LVI ‘The sympathizing youth, whose feeling heart ‘Not more of energy in fight display'd ‘Than when meek pity urg'd him aid t'impart, ‘With instant care the maiden's voice obey'd. ‘Her father's body on his shield he laid, ‘And, with the Princess on her palfrey plac'd, ‘From the red field his reliques he convey'd. ‘Soon as our line they reach'd, Blondel in haste ‘Bad her adieu, and back his course impetuous trac'd. LVII ‘For honour now with pow'r imperious call'd. ‘By stern Bellegemin no longer fir'd, ‘The Saracens, confounded and appall'd, ‘Once more before our gallant host retir'd; ‘While these, by hopes of new success inspir'd, ‘Urg'd them amain, and wide confusion spread. ‘Now Henry's worth, now Leicester we admir'd, ‘As proudly ranging o'er the Pagan dead, ‘Like Leda's warlike sons they wav'd their faulchions dread. LVIII ‘Not otherwise, when swell'd by melted snows ‘And wintry torrents, from it's parent source ‘Tow'rds ocean's shore a lordly river flows, ‘If there tempestuous billows meet it's course, ‘Tremendous is the strife: with rival force ‘The adverse waves tumultuous warfare wage; ‘High mount their foaming heads; their bellowings hoarse ‘Sound thro' the deep; nought can their feud assuage, ‘No power avails to stem their over-whelming rage. LIX ‘Soon as imperial Saladin beheld ‘The battle chang'd, and his late conq'ring band ‘Their course victorious to arrest compell'd, ‘To his remaining force he gave command ‘Forward to march the Christians to withstand. ‘Him on his charger mounted we survey'd: ‘His head a turban green, a spear his hand ‘Superbly grac'd; full royally array'd ‘He rode, while high in air his standard was display'd. LX ‘But, ere the heights they could succeed to clear ‘Or reach the plain, their purpose I espied, ‘And to the knightly band, who crouded near ‘And watch'd my orders, loudly thus I cried: “The time is come which must our fate decide! “Mark, on yon mountain's brow, the foe prepare “Fresh succour 'gainst our valiant troops to guide! “Behold their King himself their labour share, “The well-earn'd meed of fame from Leicester's brow to tear! LXI “On instant action all our hopes depend: “The day may yet by energy be won! “Let those who love me on my steps attend! “Let English zeal and valour now be shewn, “And let our foes your matchless prowess own! “Here, brave Burgundia! with my Queen remain, “'Till, bless'd by Heav'n, and grac'd with high renown, “From conquest by our arms atchiev'd again, “Your joy sincere to share, I lead my gallant train.” LXII ‘I said. My comrades straightway round me press'd, ‘And, emulous their ardour to display, ‘Wav'd their good swords and fix'd their spears in rest. ‘Pembroke, Mauleon, Tancarville, Gournay, ‘Granville, Dubois, Fitz-Gerald and Regnier, ‘And many a noble Peer of vet'ran might, ‘Combin'd to form my terrible array. ‘Onward I led them from the verdant height, ‘Across the plain to join the yet disorder'd fight. LXIII ‘That day a charger of Arabian race ‘I rode, who, on his native mountains hoar, ‘Full oft the lion's rage had dar'd to face, ‘And a proud scar, pledge of his prowess, wore. ‘O'er the wide field, distain'd with mingled gore, ‘Me, to oppose the Prince of Asia bent, ‘With not inferior courage now he bore: ‘Where'er the Pagans stood most closely pent, ‘Thro' their dissever'd ranks a passage free he rent. LXIV ‘But nor his vigour, nor the earnest hope ‘Which cheer'd me as we scour'd along the plain, ‘Avail'd: for me with Saladin to cope, ‘And end our strife, fate pleas'd not to ordain. ‘Nought could my daring warriors now restrain: ‘On ev'ry hand the Saracens dispers'd, ‘And, anxious from their King support to gain, ‘On his wide line with force tumultuous burst, ‘And far across the field his order'd march revers'd. LXV ‘Th' imperial Leader and his Satraps stern, ‘Who anxiously th' approaching ruin view'd, ‘Advanc'd in haste the flying bands to turn, ‘And, meeting them, with salutation rude ‘Their wild irruption sturdily withstood. ‘But less their menace and their fierce array ‘They fear'd, than those who closely still pursued; ‘Onward they rush'd, and with resistless sway ‘They forc'd on every side their desultory way. LXVI “Now, now,” I cried, “while heav'n our cause befriends, “Be valour worthy of it's favour shewn! “Beneath our force the foe astounded bends! “Charge once again, and victory is our own!” ‘As when the grass by sturdy hind is mown, ‘Successive swarths beneath his sharp scythe yield, ‘So were the crouded Saracens o'erthrown: ‘Nought from our fury could their close ranks shield, ‘For England's worth prevail'd, and slaughter stain'd the field. LXVII ‘At length, no longer able to sustain ‘Our firm attack and oft recurring might, ‘They fled on either hand across the plain. ‘There numbers fell: while others o'er the height ‘Tried to escape, their speed increas'd by fright. ‘Our triumph now was full, when we survey'd ‘Their King himself borne in the common flight: ‘No more by fame or hope of glory sway'd, ‘He tow'rds Esdrelon's walls his rapid progress made. LXVIII ‘To chase the vanquish'd and far scatter'd crew, ‘I bad Ermengard and his valiant band, ‘And Biddesford with his knights, their track pursue. ‘Meantime, I caus'd the trumpets give command, ‘Since now no more the Pagans dar'd withstand ‘Our dread assault, their remnant weak to spare, ‘And with experienc'd and consoling hand, ‘With kind assistance and protecting care, ‘To all our wounded friends a prompt relief to bear. LXIX ‘When these essential functions were perform'd, ‘Our fervent hearts to Heav'n's tribunal soar'd. ‘With gratitude impress'd, with feelings warm'd, ‘To the protecting and Eternal Lord ‘Our souls in pray'r and hymns of joy we pour'd. ‘Our warriors, kneeling on th' ensanguin'd ground, ‘The sov'reign Ruler of the world ador'd; ‘And, as on high the chorus swell'd around, ‘Immortal spirits heard, and sanctified the sound. LXX ‘Another mournful duty still remain'd. ‘D'Avesnes, Druell, and Isaac, hapless Chief! ‘With solemn service and regret unfeign'd ‘We laid in earth. Mute were our tongues with grief, ‘While, with sad state and ceremonial brief, ‘We paid our tribute to their worth endear'd, ‘And from our sorrow found in tears relief. ‘Of stones and turf high pil'd a mound we rear'd, ‘And waving over each his banner wide appear'd. LXXI ‘These pious rites fulfill'd, I ardent flew ‘Again my Berengaria to behold. ‘Engag'd I found her with affection true ‘Her Chariclæa in her arms t'enfold: ‘With tender speech her suff'rings she consol'd, ‘And with mild reasoning and persuasion kind ‘Her frantic lamentations she controul'd. ‘Mov'd by the scene, my efforts I combin'd, ‘And sooth'd with gentle phrase her agitated mind. LXXII ‘Soon as return'd our squadrons from the chase ‘Of Asia's Sov'reign and his host dispers'd, ‘Rejoic'd we heard the sum of his disgrace, ‘His blighted prospects, and his hopes revers'd. ‘While he, far driv'n, his wayward fortunes curs'd, ‘Our gallant warriors drain'd their goblets deep, ‘And, as they quaff'd, their day's exploits rehears'd, ‘'Till, satiated at length, in balmy sleep ‘Outstretch'd they lay, and dream'd of laurels yet to reap. LXXIII ‘A day we rested: then our strenuous host ‘Their southern march with eagerness renew'd, ‘And, to the left now verging, from the coast ‘Tow'rds Japhia's hills their vig'rous course pursued. ‘As if from victory with new strength endued, ‘They struggled with the perilous ascent, ‘And travers'd the defiles abrupt and rude: ‘Nor, tho' beneath their pond'rous arms they bent, ‘Was heard throughout their ranks the voice of discontent. LXXIV ‘When to the summit we atchiev'd our way, ‘Unbounded nature burst upon our view, ‘Luxuriant, pompous, variable and gay: ‘Mountains far-spread with outlines bold and new, ‘High-nodding woods, enrich'd with ev'ry hue ‘That Heav'n in bounty prodigal bestow'd, ‘And ocean's vast expanse, whose waters blue ‘With op'ning day's sublime effulgence glow'd, ‘While glancing in it's beams full many a vessel rode. LXXV ‘Beneath us, on the right, proud Arsur lay, ‘Extending far his promontory steep, ‘Wet with the surge, which in fantastic play ‘Beat on it's rugged front with murmurs deep. ‘Beyond it, Sharon with enchanting sweep ‘Was seen it's endless beauties to disclose, ‘It's lowing herds, it's widely-ranging sheep, ‘Each plant and flower which vegetation knows, ‘From the meek violet to it's own appropriate rose. LXXVI ‘Still thro' the vales the verdant forests bloom'd, ‘While o'er the hills was spread a mingling shade, ‘And tints more grave the rip'ning year assum'd. ‘To view their charms, Summer, cœlestial maid, ‘In rosy wreath and stole of green array'd, ‘Check'd her career, and high her tresses shook, ‘As tow'rds brown Autumn, stretch'd beneath his glade, ‘She cast a fond and oft-reverted look, ‘And sigh'd, as with regret his beauties she forsook. LXXVII ‘In no less extacy our souls were bound, ‘While, with the view enamour'd and entranc'd, ‘We gaz'd on all the glorious scene around. ‘Unsated with delight we now advanc'd ‘To Jaffa, where amid the waves was lanc'd ‘The Prophet, who, when spoke th' Eternal Lord, ‘By contumacy his offence enhanc'd. ‘There our exhausted vigour we restor'd, ‘And Heav'n's protecting aid with fervency implor'd. LXXVIII ‘The Pagan armies now the coast had left, ‘And all the regions which from Pharan lay ‘To Anti-Libanus, of aid bereft, ‘No longer own'd the Saracenic sway. ‘I bad my Queen in Jaffa's fortress stay, ‘Accompanied by Chariclæa fair, ‘While to the south I should direct my way, ‘Where Ascalon requir'd my present care, ‘To rear it's ruin'd walls, it's fortress to repair. LXXIX ‘Leaving bold Pembroke, to whose charge I gave ‘The town and neighb'ring districts to command, ‘With gallant Granville and Castellun brave, ‘Again I march'd. First, eastward from the strand, ‘To Ramula advanc'd my strenuous band, ‘Whose lofty towers the sacred fame recal ‘Of Samuel, who with consecrating hand ‘On Israel's throne plac'd disobedient Saul, ‘Doom'd on Gilboa's hills by Heav'n's decree to fall. LXXX ‘Then, by a southern course, the well-known brook ‘Which skirts the Terebynthian vale we pass'd, ‘Whence David, then to arms a stranger, took ‘The stones which 'gainst Goliath huge he cast, ‘When Judah's legions, trembling and aghast, ‘Heard the fierce champion all their host deride, ‘And shrank astounded from his puissance vast: ‘As their experienc'd Chieftains he defied, ‘Struck by a beardless youth the proud blasphemer died. LXXXI ‘Bethsames next our progress reach'd, where erst ‘Her unbelieving and presumptuous crew ‘With strange and unknown chastisements were curs'd, ‘For that the veil mysterious they withdrew, ‘And dar'd with eyes prophane the Ark to view. ‘Proceeding on, to Thamna's bound we came, ‘Where th' ænigmatic Lion Sampson slew, ‘And where, with wide exterminating flame, ‘Philistia's sons he made to tremble at his name. LXXXII ‘Advancing, soon Accaron's tow'rs were seen: ‘There whilom Beelzebub his sway maintain'd, ‘His impious worship and his rites obscene. ‘Not far remote Azotus' heights we gain'd, ‘Where Dagon's fane once stood with blood distain'd, ‘Who there, so potent prov'd the pow'rs of hell, ‘With monstrous form in state majestic reign'd: ‘But Heav'n prevail'd the Dæmon proud to quell; ‘Before the Ark of GOD the headless Idol fell. LXXXIII ‘Arriv'd at Ascalon, her boasted tow'rs ‘Dismantled and to ruin brought we found: ‘For, when the Saracens led off their pow'rs, ‘Her high and stately walls with ramparts crown'd ‘And princely fanes they levell'd with the ground, ‘Revenging thus their signaliz'd defeat. ‘I bad my host the ruins clear around; ‘And, when from Jaffa's port arriv'd my fleet, ‘With force combin'd we wrought the fortress to complete. LXXXIV ‘From Austria's and Burgundia's bands alone ‘Murmurs would sometimes break of discontent; ‘Less of effective zeal by them was shewn, ‘And less of vig'rous aid by them was lent. ‘Musing on this, one eve I sought my tent, ‘As the declining sun illum'd the west. ‘There, by fatigue o'ercome, by watchings spent, ‘My simple couch I not unwilling press'd, ‘Implor'd th' inspiring grace of Heav'n, and sank to rest. LXXXV ‘When lo! a mystic vision of the night, ‘As wrapt in sleep I lay, came o'er my soul. ‘Methought, amid the gloom, a glancing light ‘With undulating radiance gently stole: ‘A sound confus'd, like thunder's distant roll, ‘My ears invaded: straight with solemn tread, ‘And mien demonstrative of high controul, ‘A martial form advanc'd; a casque his head ‘Invelop'd, and around it's plumes diverging spread. LXXXVI ‘His aspect fill'd me with respect profound, ‘And, gazing, thrice to hail him I essay'd, ‘But awe my faculties in silence bound. ‘Meantime, his vizor raising, he display'd ‘To my fix'd eyes my Father's honour'd shade, ‘Such as I view'd him last, when pale and wan ‘His lifeless body on the bier was laid. ‘Through all my veins a sacred horror ran, ‘As thus with accents deep and hollow he began. LXXXVII “From where their final and eternal doom “Spirits from mortal coil releas'd abide, “By Heav'n supreme commission'd, lo! I come “T'announce the perils which my son betide. “From Hell's recess, the Dæmons who defied “Immortal vengeance now against thee arm, “And, with new aid by human guilt supplied, “Triumphantly prepare to work thy harm. “But let not their attempts thy constant soul alarm. LXXXVIII “T'o'ercome their malice, to thyself be just: “Thy patient toil let virtue still direct, “Nor dare th' Almighty's wisdom to distrust. “Though round thee fate her direst storms collect, “Tho' shorn thine honours and thy fortunes wreck'd, “That best dependence ne'er the brave will fail: “If He thy dark and troubled course protect, “In vain shall fiends combin'd with men assail; “O'er their united arts thy courage shall prevail. LXXXIX “With envy dire inflam'd, the Gallic King, “Reckless of faith, on rich Normannia dares “The desolating scourge of war to bring: “Thy Brother, of thy love regardless, shares “His frontless guilt, and arms against thee bears: “Thy agitated and afflicted land “Nor Pestilence nor ghastly Famine spares; “While dangers still more imminent at hand, “To mar thy great designs, insidious Hell has plann'd. XC “Burgundia's Duke, by Asia's Sov'reign bought, “Waits fit occasion to withdraw his line: “Conrad, already with foul treasons fraught, “Now meditates with him his force to join; “And Austria's Chieftain, ready to combine “With them his pow'rs, thy standard will forsake: “While Saladin, who frames the great design, “Unceasing toils the slumb'ring war t'awake, “And Jaffa's fortress hopes presumptuously to take. XCI “Let not thy soul beneath misfortune bend! “Arouse thee, Richard! and the moments seize “On which thyself and Judah's cause depend. “With humble supplication Heav'n appease: “And mark me well, while thus it's dark decrees, “So far as Spirits know them, I disclose. “Sacred to England's worth shall prove these seas: “Here shall her banners wave, nor shall her foes, “Howe'er they proudly vaunt, her armaments oppose. XCII “What tho' with felon aim embattled hosts “Against her weal insultingly conspire? “Their mighty fall shall signalize these coasts. “Surrounding nations shall her sons admire, “Who, in the battle's heat, 'midst blood and fire, “With dignified appeal their GOD address. “That GOD, to whom their constant hearts aspire, “Whose present aid their grateful souls confess, “Will sanctify their cause, and their exertions bless. XCIII “Such, in all ages, shall her race be shewn: “Prompted by freedom and religion's flame, “Throughout the world their prowess shall be known, “And climes yet unexplor'd shall own their fame. “As England's King thy share of glory claim! “As England's Champion, fortune's clouds disperse! “Recording time shall consecrate thy name, “And future bards, in ever-during verse, “Thy high exploits, thy zeal and suff'rings shall rehearse.” XCIV ‘As ended thus the awful Shade, methought ‘I leap'd transported from my lowly bed, ‘And to embrace the honour'd semblance sought. ‘But from my eager grasp the Phantom fled: ‘Of grace unspeakable a smile o'erspread ‘His visage pale, as, melting from my sight, ‘He vanish'd. I remain'd impress'd with dread, ‘Mingled with veneration and delight, ‘As to his bless'd abode he re-assum'd his flight. XCV “Oh Thou,” I pray'd, “by whom the heart is tried, “Watch o'er thy servant, and protect him still: “Deign thro' his thorny paths his steps to guide, “Confirm his courage, and direct his will. “Let me, whate'er betide, thy law fulfil, “And meet my fortunes as becomes a man. “Inspire my soul to bear approaching ill: “And, tho' my foes with dæmons frame their plan, “Grant me thy sov'reign aid their purposes to scan!” XCVI ‘Now fresh from ocean's wave arose the sun, ‘And shot his glorious beams with vigour new, ‘Prepar'd thro' Heav'n's wide arch his course to run. ‘With richest perfumes charg'd the breezes flew, ‘And shook from ev'ry plant ambrosial dew: ‘The feather'd tribes with modulation gay ‘Their wanton courtship hasten'd to renew: ‘Nature transported smil'd, as if to pay ‘Glad homage to the bright imperial Lord of day. XCVII ‘Quitting my tent, again the works I sought, ‘Where, with unceasing toil and labour keen, ‘Their portion'd task my hardy English wrought. ‘But Otho's there nor Austria's troops were seen. ‘Appriz'd of what this negligence should mean, ‘Musing I stood as Leopold drew nigh. ‘I mark'd his haughty and malignant mien, ‘And in the glances of his scowling eye ‘Treason deep-rankling read, revenge and malice sly. XCVIII ‘With open freedom I the Chieftain hail'd: “When thus united in a common cause, “Why have th' exertions of thy legions fail'd? “Ne'er can he reap the harvest of applause, “Who in the hour of need his hand withdraws, “Or seeks, when calls his duty, to retire. “Why then thy toils forbear?” After a pause, “Do'st thou,” he cried, “such proofs of zeal require? “Ne'er did such servile toils debase my noble sire! XCIX “Among thy ancestors some lab'ring hind, “Brawny and vig'rous, thou perhaps may'st quote, “To whom thy mother secretly resign'd—” ‘No more I staid to hear, but by the throat ‘I caught the railing Chief, and rudely smote ‘The mouth from which such taunts insulting flew: ‘His crest and plume into the spreading moat ‘With his proud flag disdainfully I threw, ‘And with defiance stern my trusty faulchion drew. C “If with a woman's tongue a warrior's heart “Thou join'st,” I cried, “betake thee to thy sword! “I know thy counsels, thy disgraceful art, “Thy soul with treason and corruption stor'd. “Look to thyself! thy stratagems abhorr'd, “Thy secret dealings with our Pagan foe, “No refuge now, no subterfuge afford. “Chuse as thou wil'st: a manly semblance shew, “Or hide thy recreant head dishonour'd by a blow!” CI ‘I said. Confus'd and pale the Chieftain stood, ‘And from his mouth sore wounded wip'd away, ‘As copiously it flow'd, the stream of blood. “Since thus,” he cried, “my service you repay, “Beware my vengeance! Some propitious day “May haply make me master of thy fate. “Then shalt thou crouch and tremble at my sway. “Meantime, adieu; impatient I await “A proper time to urge my never-ending hate!” CII ‘Louring he spoke, and sought his tent to gain, ‘While from the wond'ring and indignant croud, ‘At what they deem'd a declamation vain, ‘Shouts of derision burst and laughter loud. ‘How he fulfill'd the vengeance which he vow'd, ‘How he succeeded on my head to wreak ‘The bitter workings of his spirit proud, ‘'Till Heav'n and you prevail'd my bonds to break, ‘Let my acknowledg'd wrongs, my woes protracted speak.’ END OF VOL I. BOOK X. ARGUMENT. Richard continues his narrative—Defection of Leopold and Burgundy—The English and their remaining Auxiliaries embark for Jaffa—Richard proceeds thither by land, accompanied by Ten Knights—He falls in with Saladin's Army near Jaffa—Battle of Jaffa—Saladin completely defeated. I ‘Ye princely guardians of Germania's state, ‘A captive King's defence conven'd to hear! ‘Ye arbiters of injur'd Richard's fate, ‘Before whose bar I joyfully appear, ‘To plead my wrongs, and my desert to clear, ‘Let me your further gen'rous suff'rance claim! ‘Oh! deign awhile to lend a patient ear, ‘Till your free voice shall vindicate my fame, ‘And build my fair renown on yonder tyrant's shame! II ‘When Austria's vengeful Chieftain had retir'd, ‘I open'd to my friends his foul deceit, ‘And plann'd the measures which our state requir'd. ‘Each manly heart with indignation beat, ‘When thus, our task of glory incomplete, ‘Fruitless our hopes, and blasted our intent, ‘Hell's potent influence forc'd us to retreat. ‘With eyes to earth in thoughtful sadness bent, ‘My orders to fulfil the sorrowing warriors went. III ‘To ward th' attempt which Saladin might make, ‘Jaffa's half-ruin'd fortress, ill supplied ‘With forces or machines of war, to take, ‘I felt myself first call'd on to provide. ‘Thither I charg'd the brave Dubois to guide ‘My vet'ran host embark'd on board the fleet, ‘And bad Regnier at Ascalon preside, ‘There the repairs yet wanting to complete, ‘The too presumptuous views of traitors to defeat. IV ‘One morn beheld Dubois his anchor heave, ‘And false Burgundia's Duke and Austria base, ‘Stamp'd with dishonour foul, the harbour leave. ‘These, heralds of their own avow'd disgrace, ‘To distant Tyre their progress sought to trace, ‘There with Montferrat, partner in their shame, ‘With Pagan gold their feelings to solace, ‘There with joint force to vindicate his aim, ‘And, in Lusignan's wrong, his title to proclaim. V ‘By land to Jaffa I preferr'd to go; ‘For, anxious thither present aid to bear, ‘I deem'd that thus I should outstrip the foe. ‘Ten Chieftains I retain'd, of puissance rare, ‘The toils and perils of my route to share: ‘Ten, such as might with all that legends old ‘Of Charlemagne's fam'd Knights have sung compare, ‘Or those, of whom our British bards have told, ‘Whom Arthur at his board ordain'd their seats to hold. VI ‘Ye, who in deeds of hardihood delight, ‘For a few moments your attention deign, ‘While thus my comrades' titles I recite. ‘Leicester, Mauleon, Henry of Almaigne, ‘Bold Mortimer, well-fitted to sustain ‘The weight of war, Lacy, in arms renown'd, ‘Neville, and Reginald, who ne'er in vain ‘Their faulchions rear'd, Lestang still foremost found, ‘Chaveguy and Furnival with many a trophy crown'd. VII ‘These, each with his Esquire, my band compos'd. ‘Completely arm'd, each on his vig'rous steed, ‘Ere yet the sun his dawning light disclos'd, ‘The neighb'ring heights we gain'd with anxious speed. ‘To cheer our way, of many a martial deed ‘We converse held, 'till ruddy morning glow'd, ‘When far at sea we saw our fleet proceed, ‘Which o'er the gilded waves superbly rode, ‘While from each top-mast's head the crimson pennants flow'd. VIII ‘Two days our course unwearied we pursued, ‘'Till, on the second eve, the lofty fane ‘Which grac'd embattled Ramula we view'd. ‘Surpriz'd we saw around confusion reign: ‘From ev'ry quarter of the crouded plain ‘Their flocks and herds affrighted peasants drove; ‘Of babes and women a disorder'd train ‘Rush'd on, as if to reach the town they strove, ‘Whose cries and wild lament the stoutest hearts might move. IX ‘But soon the cause of their alarm we found. ‘Along the craggy and extending height, ‘Which once-illustrious Ephraim's summit crown'd, ‘Appear'd in proud array the Pagan might. ‘Ting'd by the last departing gleams of light ‘Their helmets glitter'd: down the long descent ‘Swiftly they march'd; while, on their left and right, ‘The wild Bedouins, on their steeds low bent, ‘Urg'd their destructive course, on blood and spoils intent. X ‘Still gazing on the scene, we reach'd the gate, ‘Thro' crouds tumultuous which around us press'd, ‘Where stood St. Waleric our approach to wait. ‘No time was now afforded us for rest. ‘To ascertain what might behove us best, ‘A council I conven'd without delay, ‘Where thus my brave companions I address'd. “Behold the choice which fortune leaves us—say, “Shall we submit, or force thro' yonder host our way? XI “I see your gen'rous spirits scorn to yield: “Nor less resolv'd, brave chieftains! is my own. “Oft have we rang'd together o'er the field “With slaughter stain'd, with dying Pagans strewn, “And oft immortal glory have we won. “Shall danger now our constant souls appal? “If great the risk, let equal worth be shewn! “Think, when our honour and our duty call, “Should fate our doom pronounce, triumphantly we fall.” XII ‘The warriors, with a joint consent, declar'd, ‘Their fix'd resolve the great attempt to try, ‘And for immediate enterprize prepar'd. ‘But these, whate'er their zeal or courage high, ‘Suffic'd not with a multitude to vie. ‘I therefore from the troops within the town ‘Resolv'd my want of numbers to supply, ‘Boldly with them to purchase fresh renown, ‘Or by a glorious death my former toils to crown. XIII ‘St. Waleric caus'd his legion to appear. ‘From them two thousand vet'rans bold I chose, ‘One half experienc'd to direct the spear, ‘The others arm'd with cross or yewen bows, ‘And well accustom'd to our Pagan foes. ‘These to advance on foot no cavil made, ‘For so did harsh necessity impose; ‘And fifty war-tried chieftains they obey'd, ‘Who with observance strict th' assembling host array'd. XIV ‘The star of morning now pierc'd thro' the gloom; ‘The village cock his first salute had crow'd; ‘From haunted church-yards and the recent tomb ‘Slow-flitting ghosts skimm'd tow'rds their drear abode: ‘The moon from Heav'n's high arch descending rode, ‘And still her strain sad Philomel express'd, ‘When my Arabian courser I bestrode, ‘And join'd the gallant band. My anxious breast ‘Beat high, as thus my force I hastily address'd. XV “Comrades and friends! in equal risk involv'd, “And equally I trust, whate'er betide, “To die or grac'd by fame to live resolv'd! “Prepare the fate which threatens to abide. “This day, this hour, our fortunes must decide. “What tho' with vaunting and presumptuous boast “Your numbers small yon Saracens deride? “Soon shall they know each Englishman's a host, “And that, while one remains, our victory is not lost! XVI “I urge you not your vengeful foes to meet: “Already glows each heart with gen'rous fire. “I deprecate no dastardly retreat: “For where from slaughter can we now retire? “Since then our fortunes instant act require, “Let us by pray'r from Heav'n protection claim! “Let Him whose badge we wear our souls inspire! “Thus trebly arm'd, in His eternal name “Let us to battle rush, and win immortal fame!” XVII ‘No more I said. In well-compacted state ‘And silently I led my valiant train ‘Down the descent, which, winding from the gate, ‘Conducted to the far-extending plain. ‘Now, 'gan the dawn o'er night ascendance gain, ‘And with it's feeble but unerring light ‘Shew'd us the perils which we must sustain. ‘On ev'ry hand appear'd the Pagan might, ‘And shouts of war were heard, and yells of wild affright. XVIII ‘Still unappall'd our steady course we held; ‘And, tho' the swift Bedouins round us flew, ‘Successfully their efforts we repell'd, ‘'Till tow'rds Ereccon's ruin'd walls we drew. ‘There, in a long and terrible review, ‘Arrang'd we saw the Saracenic line. ‘Halting, we ceas'd our progress to pursue, ‘And framing instantly the bold design, ‘Tow'rds Caspin's lake I bad my troop their march incline. XIX ‘Before us, far as could extend our sight, ‘A level plain to Jaffa's port was spread, ‘Crouded with foes all earnest for the fight. ‘Corazin there his bold Arabians led, ‘Facardin rang'd th' Egyptian band, and dread ‘Surcondar there his Turcomans array'd: ‘Caifar brought his host in Nubia bred; ‘Orasmin there the Persian flag display'd, ‘And Syria's warlike sons Almanzor brave obey'd. XX ‘Each squadron twice five hundred men contain'd, ‘All us'd to arms, each mounted on a steed ‘Of race illustrious and to battle train'd. ‘An equal troop we saw Bedreddin lead, ‘Of those whom Thabir's savage mountains breed, ‘And who, amid the desert's parch'd extent, ‘With bloody impulse and resistless speed, ‘Like hungry wolves the wand'ring pilgrim scent, ‘And with his spoils bedeck their oft-transported tent. XXI ‘Soon as the station I had mark'd we reach'd, ‘From the long causeway with thick hedges crown'd ‘I plac'd my ranks of combatants, which stretch'd ‘To where the lake far spreading and profound ‘Their left protected, and the valley bound. ‘My men at arms, fixing their shields askance, ‘Their right knees firmly planted on the ground, ‘In double line grasp'd each his slanting lance, ‘And form'd an iron fence to check the foe's advance. XXII ‘Behind, with bows of either sort supplied ‘And store of darts, my archers form'd a band: ‘Full well they knew their steady shafts to guide, ‘And, so unerring was their practis'd hand, ‘Nor helm nor cuirass could their force withstand. ‘I and my comrades, station'd in the rear, ‘Where well the movements of the foe we scann'd, ‘Each mounted on his steed, with rested spear ‘And vizor clos'd remain'd relief and aid to bear. XXIII ‘Scarcely this new arrangement was complete, ‘When on our line a charge impetuous made ‘The Nubian horsemen. Fitly them to greet ‘Our archers drew their bows, and undismay'd ‘Amid their ranks a show'r of arrows play'd, ‘With aim so certain and such deadly force, ‘That suddenly their onset fierce they staid, ‘And left the field o'erspread with many a corse, ‘While loud their cries were heard and imprecations hoarse. XXIV ‘When their far-scatter'd band Facardin view'd, “Tho' Nubia's sons,” he cried, “the contest fly, “My bold Egyptians shall the work conclude: “Our arms of proof their feather'd shafts defy!” ‘With that, intent the enterprise to try, ‘The swarthy warriors, like an angry flood, ‘Scour'd o'er the plain, and wav'd their sabres high. ‘Our steady vet'rans well their charge withstood, ‘And ev'ry quiv'ring spear was deeply stain'd with blood. XXV ‘But soon an arrow with resistless stroke ‘A passage thro' Facardin's helmet found: ‘His frontal bone it's point well-temper'd broke, ‘And 'mid his kindred Chiefs he press'd the ground. ‘Their leader slain, his squadron fled around: ‘While our stout archers wide destruction wrought, ‘And pierc'd their backs with many a shameful wound, ‘They, better wisdom by experience taught, ‘Urging their steeds the means of present safety sought. XXVI ‘The Turcomanian squadron now came on, ‘Superbly mounted on their coursers fleet, ‘While far their casques and burnish'd hauberks shone: ‘Them the dispers'd Egyptians chanc'd to meet, ‘As o'er the plain they hasten'd to retreat, ‘And rush'd among their ranks in order pent. ‘Ill did the host their rude irruption greet, ‘While their tough bows again our archers bent, ‘And 'mid th' entangled croud their home-drawn arrows sent. XXVII ‘Surcondar, their proud Chieftain, mad with rage, ‘Now here, now there, his foaming steed impell'd, ‘And strove the mingled bands to disengage. ‘But terror had their martial ardour quell'd, ‘And apprehension present danger swell'd. ‘Soon as the wide confusion I perceiv'd, “No longer,” cried I, “be our zeal withheld! “Ere yet our foes embarrass'd are reliev'd, “Deeds worthy of our fame may doubtless be atchiev'd!” XXVIII ‘Fill'd with disdain, and eager for the fight, ‘First thro' their phalanx gallant Neville broke. ‘Than him our cause own'd not a worthier Knight. ‘His spear he pois'd, and with tremendous stroke ‘Terror, dismay, and death around awoke. ‘Him near approaching fierce Arsames view'd, ‘As seeking still fresh contests to provoke, ‘The flying Turcomans he yet pursued; ‘And thus aloud exclaim'd with salutation rude: XXIX “Well does the Bear, which dignifies thy crest, “The savage and remorseless heart bespeak “Which rankles in thy unbelieving breast! “Thus shall my lance it's foul recesses seek!” ‘He said, and eager his revenge to wreak, ‘Struck in the centre of his polish'd shield, ‘And shiver'd on it's boss his weapon weak. ‘More sure was Neville's arm. The Pagan reel'd, ‘And o'er the crupper borne press'd the ensanguin'd field. XXX ‘Cassim, who from Circassia's barb'rous shore ‘(Where from his Sire the use of arms he learn'd) ‘To Saladin a reinforcement bore, ‘Arsames' combat and defeat discern'd. ‘With fury and regret his bosom burn'd: ‘Couching his lance the Christian Chief he sought, ‘Who, marking his intent, his courfer turn'd, ‘And with such certain aim and vigour wrought, ‘That thro' the eye transfix'd to earth his foe he brought. XXXI ‘From his crush'd brain Neville his spear withdrew, ‘And hastily replac'd it in the rest, ‘As to attack him sturdy Mourad flew. ‘A potent steed of Turkish race he press'd, ‘Of unmatch'd fierceness, which his hand had dress'd, ‘And taught, when rag'd the fight, his aid to join. ‘Thus he exclaim'd, as vengeance fir'd his breast, “Turn, caitiff! turn, thy trophies now are mine! “To Mahomet thy head devoted I consign!” XXXII “Thee and thy Prophet, I alike regard, “And thus I answer!” Neville quickly cried, ‘And with his ashen spear he struck him hard. ‘On Mourad's buckler caught it glanc'd aside. ‘He, while his foe he hardily defied, ‘With well-accustom'd voice his steed impell'd: ‘Who, rearing, on the adverse horse applied ‘His savage teeth where high his arch'd neck swell'd, ‘And, as if us'd to blood, his gripe unsated held. XXXIII ‘While valiant Neville, doubly thus assail'd, ‘Quitting his spear to draw his faulchion strove, ‘Stern Mourad rudely smote his cuirass mail'd, ‘And soon, so vig'rously his mace he drove, ‘Thro' all the foldings of his buckler clove; ‘While his fast-bleeding charger, mad with pain, ‘His rude oppressor struggled to remove: ‘But all his efforts were employ'd in vain, ‘So well was he his hold instructed to retain. XXXIV ‘His weapon Mourad now insulting heav'd, ‘And soon his fate bold Neville must have found, ‘Had not brave Reginald the strife perceiv'd. ‘He, with a shout which made the field resound, ‘Struck Mourad where his neck the cuirass bound, ‘And, urging on his pow'rful charger's speed, ‘With rapid movement bore him to the ground, ‘And overthrowing his astounded steed, ‘From both his foes at once his suff'ring comrade freed. XXXV “Thanks to high Heav'n!” exclaim'd the victor Knight, “Which, when most needed, brought me to thine aid! “Together will we prosecute the fight. “Let the fierce steed which late yon Chief obey'd, “By thy more worthy guidance now be sway'd; “Brandish his mace, and grasp his ample shield!” ‘No hesitation valiant Neville made; ‘And soon the gallant pair rush'd o'er the field, ‘Where their transcendent worth my other friends reveal'd. XXXVI ‘Full well did Mortimer his share perform. ‘Among the squadrons of th' embattled foe ‘He swept tremendous, like a wintry storm, ‘Whose raging blasts the forest's pride o'erthrow, ‘And strike the time-defying castles low. ‘Where'er he turn'd amid th' affrighted band, ‘His matchless force he made the Pagans know: ‘They fled amain, unable to withstand ‘The desolating pow'r of his avenging hand. XXXVII ‘As o'er the field stern Gemaleddin glanc'd ‘His anxious eye, the Champion he perceiv'd, ‘And hastily to stem his course advanc'd. ‘A Georgian Prince was he, who had atchiev'd ‘Deeds of renown, and honours high receiv'd ‘From Asia's Sov'reign. As amid the fight ‘Bold Mortimer he view'd, his bosom heav'd: “Alla forbid! that thus a single Knight “At our expence,” he cried, “should signalize his might!” XXXVIII ‘With that against bold Mortimer he rode. ‘At the first shock their spears in fragments flew, ‘And either Chief his crest unwilling bow'd. ‘Their weapons, useless now, away they threw, ‘And instantly their biting faulchions drew, ‘And hand to hand in dreadful strife engag'd. ‘At awful distance stood the trembling crew, ‘While doubtfully the bloody combat rag'd, ‘And each opponent struck with fury unassuag'd. XXXIX ‘At length, upon his adversary's helm ‘Stout Gemaleddin smote with impulse rude. ‘The weighty blow might have suffic'd t' o'erwhelm ‘A warrior less with energy endued: ‘But he, tho' stunn'd, it's mighty force withstood, ‘While, glancing from his crest, the weapon fell, ‘And in his wounded shoulder drank his blood. ‘Now 'gan with joy the Pagan's bosom swell, ‘And now again he sought his faulchion to impel. XL ‘But vain his hope, his savage transport brief: ‘For, as th' encounter eager to decide ‘He rais'd on high his arm, the Christian Chief, ‘His utmost power collecting, on his side, ‘Guarded no more, a deadly blow applied. ‘Deep in his bowels sank the trenchant blade; ‘A crimson'd stream his polish'd armour dyed; ‘Quick-glancing phantoms o'er his eye-balls play'd, ‘And, to abide it's doom, fled his indignant shade. XLI ‘Omar and Selim saw their leader's fall, ‘As they together rang'd the hostile field. ‘From Georgia they at Gemaleddin's call ‘Had hasten'd, both instructed well the shield, ‘The sabre, and the massy lance to wield. ‘Fury, regret and shame their souls inflam'd: ‘As if his blood for great revenge appeal'd, ‘And from their friendship retribution claim'd, ‘With joint attack their spears 'gainst Mortimer they aim'd. XLII ‘The wary Chieftain noted their advance. ‘As Selim made his charge with fell intent, ‘He wheel'd aside, and 'scap'd his threat'ning lance, ‘While, Omar's menac'd vengeance to prevent, ‘With his good sword a weighty blow he lent, ‘Which, thro' the cuirass that his shoulders bound ‘Forcing it's way, his bosom widely rent. ‘His spirit sought a passage thro' the wound, ‘And far beyond his steed he bleeding press'd the ground. XLIII “Those who attempt,” cried Mortimer, “to wreak “Like thee their rage, like thee should meet their end! “Farewell! I go thy comrade base to seek: “His shall thy hov'ring soul ere long attend, “And death again shall give to thee thy friend!” ‘He said, and turn'd the furious Chief to meet: ‘But Lacy, his associate to defend, ‘And Selim's murd'rous purpose to defeat, ‘Eager across the field had urg'd his courser fleet. XLIV ‘Thro' routed bands, which ill his force withstood, ‘And hot with toil, the vet'ran warrior came, ‘Waving on high his faulchion stain'd with blood. ‘As Selim couch'd his spear with vengeful aim, ‘Rushing between, he cried with loud acclaim, “Pagan! forbear, thy purpose vile forego: “If thy false heart be sensible of shame, “In equal fight attempt thy worth to shew, “Nor thus presume to strike an unresisting foe!” XLV ‘He said, and stood his onset fierce to meet. ‘The sturdy Pagan his defiance heard, ‘And thus rejoin'd: “No more thy taunts repeat! “A wrangler's tongue my spirit never stirr'd, “Nor can by threats my purpose be deferr'd. “Hence! or the vengeance of my arm abide!” ‘Then, summoning his strength, his steed he spurr'd, ‘And full on Lacy's shield his lance applied, ‘But from the polish'd orb it flew diverging wide. XLVI ‘He sought his foaming courser's speed to check; ‘But, ere he could command the loosen'd rein, ‘With strong back-handed blow upon his neck ‘Impetuous Lacy struck, nor struck in vain. ‘His head, far sever'd, bounded o'er the plain, ‘Which deeply of th' empurpled current drank ‘That gush'd in torrents from each spouting vein, ‘While his swift steed bore off thro' many a rank ‘His lifeless trunk, 'till 'mid the Georgian host it sank. XLVII ‘While thus my comrades brave maintain'd the fight, ‘And still th' unequal strife unaw'd pursued, ‘My bold Arabian with transcendent might ‘Bore me where'er the Pagans closest stood. ‘My way was mark'd with Saracenic blood: ‘Thrice nerv'd I felt my arm, with throbbing force ‘My mounting heart propell'd the vital flood, ‘As thro' their bands I held my fatal course, ‘And strew'd the champaign wide with many a breathless corse. XLVIII ‘Orban first met my overwhelming spear. ‘He, as the proud Surcondar had decreed, ‘Was charg'd the Turcomanian flag to bear: ‘But Heav'n had doom'd him by my hand to bleed. ‘Bold Hassan, mounted on a furious steed, ‘Oppos'd my progress: him the hope of prey ‘From rude Circassia had prevail'd to lead; ‘But short and baseless prov'd his visions gay, ‘Thro' his broad chest transfix'd on Jaffa's plain he lay. XLIX ‘Th' indignant Mustapha, as near he rode, ‘His brother's rash attempt and fall perceiv'd. ‘Together had they left their sire's abode, ‘And many a daring enterprize atchiev'd, ‘And now of life together were bereav'd: ‘For, as against me furiously he rush'd, ‘And high in air his glitt'ring faulchion heav'd, ‘My lance the vizor of his helmet crush'd: ‘He fell, and from his mouth a flood empurpled gush'd. L ‘Ali, a Persian Prince, my wrath defied. ‘He, ere the trump of bloody war was heard, ‘Survey'd his vast domain, his pastures wide, ‘With many a flock enrich'd and lowing herd: ‘A sumptuous Harem he had lately rear'd, ‘To guard the beauties whom his wealth had bought, ‘Whose fond remembrance present danger cheer'd. ‘But vain relief these recollections brought: ‘From me he found the death his arrogance had sought. LI ‘As thus across the field with slaughter red ‘I rode, and still the Pagan carnage swell'd, ‘Surcondar mark'd my crown-encircled head, ‘And 'gainst me furiously his steed impell'd. “Impatiently,” cried he, “have I beheld “Thy single force our armaments defy. “Now shall thy prowess by my arm be quell'd: “While here thy limbs a feast to birds supply, “The spoils of England's King shall grace my triumphs high!” LII “The spoils of England's King,” I straight rejoin'd, “Are not, I ween, for pow'rs like thine reserv'd! “Ere Richard yield, he must a foeman find, “Whose vig'rous arm more potently is nerv'd.” ‘We met. His spear upon my buckler swerv'd, ‘While mine into a thousand fragments flew. ‘Surcondar instantly the chance observ'd, ‘And turn'd his steed the combat to renew. ‘I breath'd a pray'r to Heav'n, and forth my faulchion drew. LIII ‘Couching his spear the Turcoman advanc'd: ‘It struck my shield with hides and iron bound, ‘And from my body far innoxious glanc'd. ‘With better aim I wav'd my faulchion round. ‘Cleaving his head, my blade a passage found ‘Thro' his bright mail, and with resistless might ‘Struck his right arm and shoulder to the ground. ‘Bleeding he sank: to realms of endless night ‘His too-aspiring soul took it's unwilling flight. LIV ‘Soon as to earth the vanquish'd Chieftain fell, ‘Amid his band oppress'd by grief and fear ‘My foaming steed I turn'd, when brave Blondel, ‘Who still my progress had attended near, ‘Exclaim'd, “See yonder, where to fate severe “The bold Mauleon is compell'd to yield! “Him, his good courser slain, the Pagans bear “With shouts triumphant o'er the bloody field, “And seize his oft-tried lance, and high display his shield!” LV ‘Thus saying, quickly from his steed he leapt, ‘And to my hand Surcondar's weapon gave. ‘With vengeful course across the plain I swept, ‘And, fill'd with ardent zeal my friend to save, ‘Thro' the close-thronging multitude I drave. ‘Approaching near, “Hence, ye ignoble crew!” ‘I loudly cried, “forego my comrade brave!” ‘Appall'd they heard, and fearfully withdrew, ‘While tow'rds him thus redeem'd impatiently I flew. LVI “Courage!” I cried, “since thus to save my friend “My aid the Pow'r eternal has decreed, “Let us our course with arms associate bend!” ‘To my request the vet'ran Chief agreed, ‘And, seizing by the rein a wand'ring steed ‘Whose rider's bleeding corse the champaign stain'd, ‘He vaulted on his back. With anxious speed ‘We rush'd, to where bold Leicester's Earl remain'd ‘Girt round by threat'ning foes, and doubtful strife maintain'd. LVII ‘While thus the Pagan's onset we repell'd, ‘Asia's proud Sov'reign, from a neighb'ring height, ‘Where 'mid his crouded Peers he stood, beheld ‘The unexpected issue of the fight. “And is it thus ye prove your boasted might? “Is this your prowess?” furiously he cried: “Princes! with me your energy unite: “Be our's the task the contest to decide! “Let Mahomet his sons to fame and victory guide!” LVIII ‘He said. Not swifter from a sulph'rous cloud, ‘When thro' the troubled and deep-mantled sky ‘The voice of thunder breaks abrupt and loud, ‘O'er Heav'n's wide arch quick-glancing light'nings fly, ‘Than rush'd the Prince the chance of war to try. ‘As when with rapid wing to earth descends ‘Some lordly eagle from his station high, ‘Where'er his flight imperiously he bends, ‘Terror his progress marks, and death his course attends: LIX ‘With no less vengeful force or fatal aim ‘Imperial Saladin his puissance shew'd, ‘His routed bands to vindicate from shame. ‘Fir'd with disdain bold Furnival he view'd, ‘As 'mid the host his efforts he renew'd, ‘And rode triumphantly o'er heaps of dead. ‘Him he assaulted with encounter rude: ‘Piercing his helm, his lance transfix'd his head, ‘And, as to earth he fell, the warrior's spirit fled. LX ‘Nor did a fate less harsh Chaveguy betide. ‘He, when he saw the Asian King advance ‘Red with his comrade's blood, his force defied, ‘And aim'd against him his well-temper'd lance: ‘But on his shield receiv'd it pass'd askance, ‘While him the Monarch smote upon the breast, ‘And drove him to the earth in deadly trance. ‘Than him no worthier son Poictou confess'd, ‘None when alive more lov'd, in glorious death more bless'd. LXI ‘High thro' the Pagan host a shout arose, ‘Not less astounding than the midnight blast, ‘Which, pregnant with alarm and unknown woes, ‘Sweeps o'er the sea, while, 'midst it's billows vast, ‘The trembling mariner, with dread aghast, ‘Hears the wild surf upon the breakers rage, ‘And fancies every ling'ring hour the last. ‘So did the sound our wond'ring souls engage, ‘Nor did it less of ill and horrors new presage. LXII ‘We turn'd, and saw our friends expiring lie, ‘While tow'rds us Saladin impetuous came, ‘His spear ensanguin'd brandishing on high. ‘My brave companions, fill'd with gen'rous shame, ‘Felt their bold hearts inspir'd with glory's flame, ‘And 'gainst th' imperial Chief their course prepar'd, ‘When thus I cried: “This enterprise I claim, “This to myself I arrogate unshar'd! “Now shall the Christian wrongs and suff'rings be repair'd!” LXIII ‘No more I said, nor for their answer stay'd; ‘But, rushing thro' the far-encircling croud, ‘I reach'd the spot where Saladin display'd ‘His warlike prowess 'mid his Satraps proud. ‘Approaching near him, thus I cried aloud: “By England's King is Asia's Prince defied! “Our congress now has fav'ring Heav'n allow'd! “Here, if thou dar'st my onset to abide, “Let us with equal arms Judæa's fate decide!” LXIV ‘Thus saying, I awaited his reply. ‘In accents loud he quickly thus rejoin'd: “Those, who the pow'r of Asia's King defy, “The terrors of his arm are wont to find! “Of all the Chiefs in hostile league combin'd, “None than thyself I more desire to meet. “Thanks to our Prophet, who has thus consign'd “To me thy vain presumption to defeat, “And by thy fall my hopes of triumph to complete!” LXV ‘He said. Around him rose an outcry hoarse, ‘As, with his lance in rest, across the field ‘He drove against me with impetuous force. ‘Midway I met him. On each sturdy shield, ‘As forcibly we struck, our weapons peal'd, ‘But from the polish'd orbs innoxious flew, ‘While with the shock our puissant chargers reel'd. ‘Soon disengag'd a circling course we drew, ‘Impell'd with equal rage our combat to renew. LXVI “Now to thy heart!” exclaim'd the furious King; ‘And, poising his stout beam with dire intent, ‘Struck at my shield and made it's concave ring. ‘With more assur'd effect my spear I bent: ‘His surcoat richly charg'd with gold it rent, ‘The gorgeous mail which deck'd his bosom crush'd, ‘And bore him to the earth with rude descent, ‘While from the wound a stream empurpled gush'd. ‘Trembling the Pagans stood, their clam'rous shouts were hush'd. LXVII ‘But, as a branch, which rudely to the ground ‘A passenger has bent with pow'rful hand, ‘Springs from his pressure with elastic bound, ‘Again it's verdant honours to expand; ‘So rush'd tumultuously the Pagan band, ‘To save their prostrate Monarch from my rage. ‘Alone their madd'ning vengeance to withstand, ‘My single arm was doom'd their host t' engage, ‘And disproportion'd war with multitudes to wage. LXVIII ‘As on some mountain bleak a moss-grown oak, ‘When blow the wintry tempests unrestrain'd, ‘Firm-rooted bears their devastating stroke; ‘Tho' rent his massy limbs, his trunk tho' stain'd, ‘He keeps the station where so long he reign'd, ‘And scorns, whate'er of ill betide, to yield: ‘So, tho' around me darts and javelins rain'd, ‘Still I prevail'd my potent spear to wield, ‘Nor, tho' beset with foes, forsook th' ensanguin'd field. LXIX ‘Nor small nor trivial was th' encounter rude ‘Of adverse arms I then was doom'd to prove. ‘When on the earth their royal Sire they view'd, ‘Furious with rage, and urg'd by filial love, ‘Miralis and Melcalez onward drove, ‘And at my breast their spears impetuous aim'd. ‘Nor less stern Safadin to reach me strove: ‘As his bold heart fraternal zeal inflam'd, ‘He shook his threat'ning lance, and high his wrath proclaim'd. LXX ‘Environ'd thus, to Heav'n's Eternal Lord, ‘My only refuge now, I breath'd a pray'r: “Oh deign,” I cried, “thy mercy to afford! “Inspire my soul impending fate to dare, “And make me worthy of the badge I wear!” ‘No more I added: for, with rapid course, ‘Against me now advanc'd the royal pair. ‘Melcalez first with imprecations hoarse ‘Came on: my polish'd shield re-echoed with his force. LXXI ‘Forward he rode: but, with succession fast, ‘Miralis rudely on my breast-plate smote. ‘His weapon thro' my yielding armour pass'd, ‘And, grazing 'twixt my shoulder and my throat, ‘Dy'd with a crimson'd torrent my surcoat: ‘Then, as his shaft he instantly withdrew, “Let this,” he cried, “my ceaseless hate denote!” ‘And, fill'd with hope his vengeful pow'r to shew, ‘With murd'rous aim he sought the conflict to renew. LXXII ‘Nor long delay'd Melcalez to advance, ‘While potent Safadin spurr'd on his steed, ‘And bent against me his enormous lance. ‘But Heav'n preserv'd me in my utmost need: ‘For brave Blondel, who with observant heed ‘Had watch'd them, now his buckler interpos'd. ‘Me from Melcalez' dread attack he freed: ‘Waving his faulchion with the Prince he clos'd, ‘And with intrepid heart his onset rude oppos'd. LXXIII ‘Ill did Melcalez his aggression brook: ‘A foe so young his haughty mind disdain'd, ‘And with indignant ire his lance he shook. ‘But him to fall the pow'rs of Heav'n ordain'd: ‘Deep thro' his cuirass mail'd, with blood distain'd, ‘Blondel's good sword with force resistless pass'd. ‘From the wide wound life's purple current drain'd: ‘On his lov'd Sire his ling'ring eyes he cast, ‘And, calling on his name, the warrior breath'd his last. LXXIV ‘T' avenge his fall Miralis fiercely turn'd. ‘As stretch'd in death his brother he survey'd, ‘His grief-struck soul with tenfold fury burn'd: ‘His spear portentous as he high display'd, ‘And urg'd his steed, “To dear Melcalez' shade “Thus I consign thy spirit!” loud he cried. ‘Straightway against him his assault he made, ‘And stoutly on his shield his beam applied. ‘The point ill-temper'd broke, and fell in fragments wide. LXXV ‘Aside his weapon, useless now, he threw, ‘And, drawing instantly his faulchion bright, ‘Against his foe with rage redoubled flew. ‘Their fierce encounter ill can I recite, ‘Or tell the terrors of their per'lous fight: ‘For Safadin, with vengeance unassuag'd, ‘Urg'd 'gainst my breast his lance; with fell despight ‘And desp'rate purpose either bosom rag'd, ‘As if at once for life and fame we combat wag'd. LXXVI ‘Both shields resounded with our frequent stroke: ‘Rude was the shock, and far upon the ground ‘The wreck was scatter'd as our lances broke. ‘Now high our glitt'ring blades we whirl'd around, ‘And many a blow we gave and many a wound: ‘Thro' his far-beaming armour to his breast ‘My biting sword a ready passage found, ‘While his transcendant force my helm confess'd, ‘And bore of his assault memorials deep impress'd. LXXVII ‘And now, as either mail and corselet rung, ‘And, while our nerves augmenting fury brac'd, ‘In dread suspense our doubtful conflict hung, ‘Their Monarch, still insensible, in haste ‘His faithful Satraps on a chariot plac'd, ‘And tow'rds Assaron, far beyond the plain ‘Red with his blood, their anxious travel trac'd; ‘There from the leech's art relief to gain, ‘And by the sov'reign pow'r of herbs to sooth his pain. LXXVIII ‘Soon as this pious duty was perform'd, ‘On my devoted head an iron show'r ‘From ev'ry side with aim unerring storm'd. ‘O'er me remorseless fate now seem'd to lour; ‘And doubtless soon, in inauspicious hour, ‘Me, their assault unable to withstand, ‘Their force united had prevail'd t' o'erpow'r, ‘Had not, when needed most, Heav'n's guardian hand ‘Deign'd to support my cause, and check their vengeful band. LXXIX ‘For now Blondel his foe to earth had fell'd, ‘His helmet shatter'd and his cuirass pierc'd, ‘And boldly to my aid his steed impell'd. ‘Mauleon too his foes had now dispers'd, ‘And hastily across their ranks revers'd ‘Rush'd to support me with encounter dread: ‘While a fresh host of warriors onward burst, ‘All mounted on the chargers of the dead, ‘Before whose onset fierce the trembling Pagans fled. LXXX ‘The adverse Chiefs, Miralis to protect, ‘And from destruction Safadin to shield, ‘(Who now, his sword scarce able to direct, ‘Seem'd to my greater force prepar'd to yield,) ‘Advanc'd from ev'ry quarter of the field ‘Soon with redoubled fury rag'd the fight: ‘Each combatant his utmost pow'rs reveal'd, ‘And, as undaunted they approv'd their might, ‘Death shook his sable wings, and shriek'd with stern delight. LXXXI ‘As thus my comrades urg'd their bloody strife, ‘My arm the fainting Safadin pursued; ‘And soon had ebb'd his near exhausted life, ‘Had not two puissant Chiefs our contest view'd: ‘Araspes, whom, from Syria's deserts rude, ‘Among his leaders Saladin had class'd; ‘And fierce Bedreddin, whose huge limbs endued ‘With strength enormous, and whose stature vast ‘The most redoubted sons of Araby surpass'd. LXXXII ‘Soon as, approaching o'er th' encrimson'd field, ‘They saw the peril of their gallant friend, ‘Bedreddin cried, “Be thine his head to shield! “Ward off the blows which on his crest descend, “While I to bear him hence my succour lend!” ‘He said. Araspes instantly complied, ‘And, ere surpriz'd I could my shield extend, ‘While with loud voice my prowess he defied, ‘With vig'rous aim he struck my unprotected side. LXXXIII ‘It fail'd to penetrate my cuirass steel'd, ‘But with effect so potent came the blow, ‘That with the shock unwillingly I reel'd. ‘I felt my breast with indignation glow, ‘As, forc'd the vanquish'd Chieftain to forego, ‘I left the conquest which my sword had earn'd, ‘To combat with a less illustrious foe. ‘Rage fill'd my soul, my heart with vengeance burn'd, ‘As to receive his charge impatiently I turn'd. LXXXIV ‘While thus we were engag'd, th' Arabian Chief, ‘Rejoic'd to find his stratagem succeed, ‘Quickly advanc'd to Safadin's relief. ‘Perceiving him from many a wound to bleed, ‘He firmly grasp'd him, and upon his steed ‘Before himself the fainting Prince he plac'd: ‘Then, urging on his courser's utmost speed, ‘Who panted with his double load, in haste ‘Far from the scene of blood his eager course he trac'd. LXXXV ‘I saw them fly, and, like a wretch forlorn ‘On Afric's sultry desert, from whose hand ‘His last refreshing draught is rudely torn, ‘While round him stretch unmeasur'd wilds of sand, ‘And arid plains by streams unblest expand, ‘I gaz'd awhile, lost in distracting thought. ‘But soon, compell'd Araspes to withstand, ‘I charg'd him, and with fierce resentment sought ‘T' avenge the wrong which his confed'racy had wrought. LXXXVI ‘Again his weapon he against me bent: ‘But fruitless prov'd his hope, his effort vain; ‘His shatter'd spear betray'd his fell intent. ‘My faulchion forc'd a passage to his brain; ‘Stagg'ring he dropt his unavailing rein: ‘Awhile, with progress swift, his frighten'd steed ‘Bore him unconscious o'er th' ensanguin'd plain, ‘'Till to the earth he fell, by fate decreed ‘Far from his native home the fowls of Heav'n to feed. LXXXVII ‘While thus eventfully the battle rag'd, ‘A sudden and astounding shout was heard. ‘The pow'rful sound our wond'ring souls engag'd. ‘Nearer it drew, and soon in air high rear'd ‘The welcome banners of our isle appear'd. ‘I view'd my comrades, who to Jaffa's coast ‘In hour propitious had their gallies steer'd, ‘And now led on their enterprizing host, ‘To aid us and to share our yet appropriate boast. LXXXVIII ‘Onward they came in terrible array: ‘Dubois the gallant reinforcement led, ‘With Harcourt, Tancarville, and bold Gournay. ‘As from a dream replete with horrors dread, ‘Where hideous phantoms, from distemper bred, ‘Glance in succession wild, at morn awakes ‘Some agitated sleeper, from his bed ‘Starting he hails the light which round him breaks, ‘And from his troubled soul the fearful vision shakes: LXXXIX ‘So cheering was the ray which o'er us burst, ‘When to our aid our brave companions came, ‘And valiantly the Pagan bands dispers'd. ‘Each leader fill'd with glory's purest flame, ‘And urg'd by hope to win his share of fame, ‘Seem'd danger's front ambitious to provoke: ‘While, deaf alike to honour and to shame, ‘The trembling foe before their furious stroke ‘Fled, and their scatter'd ranks in wild confusion broke. XC ‘While thus, on ev'ry side, their routed band ‘Our troops elate with victory held in chase, ‘Leaping to earth, Blondel with careful hand ‘Hasten'd Miralis' helmet to unlace. ‘Clos'd were his eyes, and pallid was his face, ‘Yet still his pulse, with interrupted beat, ‘And frequent pause, pursued it's languid race, ‘And, round his flutt'ring heart, some vital heat ‘Denoted ling'ring life still kept it's wonted seat. XCI ‘As brave Blondel his gen'rous zeal display'd, ‘Nor from his foe withheld his pitying tears, ‘Thus to the Chiefs assembled round I said. “Behold how lovely Charity appears, “When with kind aid her vanquish'd foe she cheers, “And mis'ry of it's sharpest sting disarms! “Her gentle sway the bonds of life endears; “By her, religion blooms with new-born charms, “And man's obdurate heart with soft affection warms. XCII “Say, what return deserves the warrior brave, “Whose valour and transcendent worth avail'd, “When fate most frown'd, his monarch's life to save? “Who, when the sons of Saladin assail'd, “Singly to crush their tow'ring hopes prevail'd? “Desert like his with never-fading bays, “And honour's choicest guerdon, should be hail'd; “For him should Chivalry her trophies raise, “And dignify the worth which soars beyond our praise.” XCIII ‘From all the Peers approving murmurs broke, ‘When on his blood-stain'd shoulder I applied ‘My sword, and, as I gently gave the stroke, ‘Thus to the high-deserving Champion cried. “Rise, Sir Blondel! thy grateful country's pride! “Henceforth assume a Christian Knight's proud name! “Still may approving Heav'n thy footsteps guide, “May thy example England's youth inflame “Like thee to win renown and bear the meed of fame.” XCIV ‘I said. With modest grace uprose the youth— ‘But ah! forgive, when I behold him there, ‘When I recal the gen'rous zeal and truth, ‘Which led him, to redeem me from despair, ‘Again new perils and new toils to dare, ‘That thus my grateful feelings I proclaim. ‘Oh! may there come a time, when thou may'st share, ‘Thrice-valued friend! my fortunes and my fame, ‘And consecrate with mine thy highly honour'd name! XCV ‘Forgive, if, while his matchless worth I feel, ‘I speak the warm effusions of my breast. ‘Thus I resume.—He struggled to conceal ‘The strong emotions which his soul oppress'd, ‘Then, blushing, said, “Too much for utt'rance blest, “By the warm tear which fond affection draws “Be my eternal gratitude confess'd! “Oh! may I live to merit thy applause, “Or, as becomes me, fall in thine and England's cause!” XCVI “Trust to thy King,” I cried; “thy worth he knows, “Thy soul to honour and allegiance true. “But now, brave comrades, while the routed foes “On ev'ry side our eager bands pursue, “Let us, with rev'rence meet and homage due, “Return our thanks for Heav'n's protecting care. “While of his mercies here the scene we view, “Let us to GOD unite in heart-felt pray'r, “And, as we shar'd the risk, in hymns triumphant share. XCVII “Mark where renown'd Diospolis appears! “There, where Justinian's decorated fane “In solemn state it's dome majestic rears, “Enshrin'd the relics of St. George remain. “Before his altar, let us seek to gain “The noblest recompence of virtuous toil: “That Heav'n to bless our sacred cause may deign, “And that the Saint and Patron of our isle, “A Soldier erst himself, on England's arms may smile!” END OF BOOK X. BOOK XI. ARGUMENT. Richard proceeds with his narrative—He states his return to Acre—the transactions there, and his truce with Saladin—He concludes his defence—Is unanimously acquitted, and leaves the hall—The Emperor's phrenzy— Apparition of Belial—he summons his associate Fiends, and repairs with them to England. I ‘When duty's sacred call we had obey'd, ‘And with Hosannas to the Pow'r Divine ‘Our homage due of gratitude had paid, ‘Sighing I cried, “Here, near St. George's shrine, “Let us to worth deceas'd a place assign. “Here let Chaveguy and Furnival repose: “Let their remains by England's Saint recline, “'Till, when his awful trump the Angel blows, “Their martyr'd dust again the bursting tomb disclose.” II ‘I said. Ere long across the bloody plain ‘The bodies of the heroes were convey'd, ‘And, in a grave within St. George's fane, ‘With 'custom'd rites and decent pomp were laid. ‘Above their tombs their banners we display'd; ‘And, on the altar as their swords we plac'd, ‘And thus our last respectful tribute paid, ‘Our tears the mem'ry of our comrades grac'd, ‘With whom so oft the paths of glory we had trac'd. III ‘To Jaffa now we hastily advanc'd, ‘Whose citizens, redeem'd from threaten'd harms, ‘Our prowess with triumphant songs enhanc'd. ‘Then sprang my Berengaria to my arms: ‘Her joy contrasting with her late alarms, ‘She held her victor consort to her breast, ‘And, beaming with innumerable charms, ‘While scarce her voice th' emotion strong express'd, ‘Bliss which expression mock'd her melting eyes confess'd. IV ‘Soon as the leech's art our wounds had heal'd, ‘And rest had brac'd our limbs by travel tir'd, ‘And nerv'd again each arm the sword to wield, ‘By courtesy and feelings high inspir'd, ‘The presence of Miralis I requir'd. ‘His brow o'ercast bespoke his troubled soul; ‘Nought spake he, but, abstracted and retir'd, ‘His grief and shame he sought not to controul, ‘And kind Blondel had fail'd his anguish to console. V ‘As still from loss of blood he seem'd depress'd, ‘I gently urg'd him to partake my seat, ‘And thus with temper'd phrase the Prince address'd: “'Tis not exulting in your late defeat, “That early thus your presence I intreat. “No, valiant youth! tho' now by fav'ring fate “No more as rivals in the field we meet, “Still I respect a captive warrior's state; “Ne'er shall his spirit curse my arrogance or hate. VI “Nay, Royal Sir! avert not thus your face: “Soon shall you learn that Englishmen delight “The virtues of an enemy to grace. “What tho', when rag'd the terrors of the fight, “In hostile arms array'd you prov'd your might; “Shall Richard less your chivalry esteem? “Or, 'cause a father's suff'rings to requite, “You stain'd his armour with a crimson stream, “Shall he less nobly now of your endowments deem?” VII ‘As thus I spoke, a deep suffusion dy'd ‘His pallid cheek, and, with a voice which grief ‘Half stifled held, he mournfully replied: “If to my sorrows ought could bring relief, “'Twould be thy courtesy, illustrious Chief! “But, since whate'er my life endear'd is lost, “I trust thy propositions may be brief. “Can'st thou restore my Sire, my Throne, my Host? “Can'st thou revive the dead, or calm Melcalez' ghost?” VIII “My pow'r o'er death extends not,” I rejoin'd, “Nor can my will unlock the silent tomb: “But, to relieve from woe the sick'ning mind, “To cheer the horrors of affliction's gloom, “And bid young hope expand her soaring plume, “I trust that these my influence can obtain. “Cannot I bid thee liberty resume? “Cannot I say, Again Miralis reign! “Appease thy Brother's shade, and heal thy Father's pain!” IX ‘The Prince arose with a convulsive start, ‘And on me as his eyes he wildly bent, “Forbear, alas!” he cried, “to wring a heart “Already by contending passions rent! “The mis'ries which remorseless fate has sent “Time may perhaps enable me to bear. “But no—my fortunes never can relent: “No human aid can mitigate my care; “Death can alone appease my exquisite despair!” X “Behold this badge,” I cried, “the sacred sign “Of Him whose faith and tenets I profess; “And mark the dictates of His law divine. “He bad us aid the poor, the wrong'd redress, “The sick, the pris'ner, by relief to bless, “To feed the hungry, to support the weak, “And tow'rds our foes forgiveness to express: “He bad us comfort to the suff'rer speak, “The sorrowing spirit cheer, the captive's fetters break. XI “So spake the GOD whom Christian nations serve. “And shall we, on Judæa's sacred shore “Which felt His presence, from His precepts swerve? “No longer, Prince, captivity deplore! “Return to freedom and thy Sire once more, “And with thee brave Melcalez' corse convey! “Thus to thy hand thy faulchion I restore. “When thou review'st thy royal father, say “Thus does a Christian King his GOD's commands obey.” XII “If thus,” replied the youth, “thy Christian law “Teaches to comfort and respect a foe, “Still shall Miralis think of it with awe. “Releas'd by thee to Saladin I go: “His gen'rous heart with gratitude will glow; “No more for past misfortune will he grieve, “But consolation from thy bounty know. “From thy example may I worth atchieve, “And learn what lustre arms from clemency receive.” XIII ‘As thus he spoke, drawn forth in martial state, ‘By Gournay led, appear'd a gallant train, ‘On Asia's heir with due respect to wait. ‘With brave Melcalez' bier o'er Jaffa's plain ‘They march'd, the tow'rs of Thamnathsare to gain, ‘Where, with the remnant of his vanquish'd crew, ‘The Monarch nurs'd his heart-consuming pain. ‘Meantime, embark'd our progress to renew, ‘O'er the green waves, impell'd by fav'ring blasts, we flew. XIV ‘Ere long the view of Acre's tow'rs we caught, ‘And soon, within her well-known port, our fleet ‘The pilot's skilful hand to anchor brought. ‘But there, intent our purpose to defeat, ‘Fiends spread their treasons our approach to greet: ‘Base Leopold, and Otho lost to shame, ‘Urg'd on the croud with virulence and heat, ‘To aid Montferrat's enterprising aim, ‘And him as rightful King of Judah to proclaim. XV ‘Ripe was the project which their guilt contriv'd, ‘And boldly was their purpose foul profess'd, ‘When at Lusignan's palace I arriv'd. ‘Scarce were my toils repair'd by needful rest, ‘When to the hall the factious Chieftains press'd. ‘Them closely follow'd a tumultuous band, ‘Whom oft with specious reas'nings they address'd, ‘And, as a charioteer with skilful hand ‘Governs his steeds, prevail'd their ardour to command. XVI “Wherefore,” exclaim'd I, “thus, with rude approach, “Does this licentious multitude presume “Unbidden on my privacy t' incroach?” “Their Rights, replied Montferrat, “to resume, “And to support my claim, the People come! “When they their high and sov'reign will declare, “Who is there so impatient for his doom, “Who of his safety shall so little care, “As their united force and menac'd wrath to dare?” XVII “Who shall oppose them?” straightway I rejoin'd, “From me, from England's King, that favour'd isle “Where freedom blooms, resistance shall they find. “Hence with this turbulent and madd'ning coil, “Which, foully aiming Europe's Chiefs t' embroil, “To infamy and sure destruction drives! “Hence, ye insidious Demagogues! whose guile “Support to faction and rebellion gives, “And of it's best defence our sacred cause deprives!” XVIII ‘As thus I spoke with indignation fir'd, ‘The croud abash'd my dictate stern obey'd, ‘And, as if conscious of their fault, retir'd. ‘But Conrad and his trait'rous band, afraid ‘Their fury should by reason be allay'd, ‘To bold invectives furiously gave vent, ‘And to arouse their slumb'ring rage essay'd. ‘So well fulfill'd they their accurs'd intent, ‘That threat'ning shouts once more the vaulted chamber rent. XIX ‘And now the clamour more intemp'rate grew: ‘Like pent-up waters bursting thro' their mound, ‘And urg'd by storms, rush'd on the servile crew. ‘Vain were my efforts; by the deaf'ning sound ‘Of Conrad and his Rights my voice was drown'd: ‘And desp'rate deeds their fury might have wrought, ‘Since passion now their souls to madness wound, ‘Had not Lusignan their attention caught, ‘As with his hand outstretch'd an audience he besought. XX ‘Mov'd by the tears which down his visage ran, ‘The noisy croud their turbulence restrain'd, ‘When thus the venerable King began. “Too long o'er Judah has Lusignan reign'd, “Since now his people, by corruption gain'd, “Forget their duty and renounce his cause. “The crown, which must by contest be maintain'd, “Suits not the care-worn brow of him, who draws “His only hope from Heav'n, and Heav'n's consoling laws. XXI “Alas! too much of royalty I've known. “Consuming anguish, ever-during care, “Regret and sorrow have beset my throne, “And all my prospects pointed to despair. “There needs no force, the diadem to tear “From him, who never felt it's boasted joys: “Let those, who seek the dazzling prize, beware “Of the sharp sting, which 'mid it's wreaths annoys “Their falsely-pictur'd bliss, and happiness destroys. XXII “The glare of pomp no longer can amuse “The mind in which ambitious hopes are dead: “It's splendid shadows their attraction lose. “Fancy her unsubstantial veil may spread, “Wave her gay wings, her balm Lethæan shed, “And court with smiles the victim of her art: “Arm'd with conviction from experience bred, “I drive the faithless Syren from my heart, “And seek the peace which Heav'n in mercy may impart. XXIII “Let my poor realm no civil feuds deplore: “Cease, England's King! 'gainst destiny to strive, “And tempt me with ideal pow'r no more. “Henceforth to GOD and to my soul I live, “From self-approving conscience to derive “That consolation which the world denies. “May He my errors and my crimes forgive, “May He compassionate Judæa's sighs, “And may, to end her woes, some great avenger rise!” XXIV ‘Thus spoke th' impassion'd King; and, with a look ‘Which mingled scorn and majesty confess'd, ‘The golden circlet from his brow he took, ‘And to the people who around him press'd ‘With dignified appeal himself address'd. “To you this Crown I solemnly resign. “May he, whose front it's orbit shall invest, “Meet with protection from the Pow'r Divine, “And may his rule be found more fortunate than mine!” XXV ‘Scarce had he ended, when throughout the croud, ‘Mov'd by compunction, tenderness and shame, ‘A tumult 'gan to spread: with murmurs loud ‘Each on his neighbour sought to throw the blame, ‘And 'gainst their factious leaders to exclaim, ‘Whose guilt and high presumption they had shar'd. ‘Soon ev'ry bosom caught the gen'rous flame; ‘And now, immediate vengeance they declar'd ‘'Gainst those who to traduce their injur'd King had dar'd. XXVI ‘The trait'rous Chieftains, fill'd with wild alarm, ‘Essay'd their rising fury to prevent, ‘And sought by pray'rs t' escape impending harm: ‘But still fresh shouts the hall of audience rent, ‘The croud 'gainst Conrad rush'd with one consent, ‘When good Lusignan, with benignant care, ‘Implor'd them to restrain their rude intent, ‘And urg'd me my concurrence to declare ‘With his resolve no more Judæa's crown to wear. XXVII ‘While reign'd the tumult, as immers'd in thought ‘I studied how the contest I might close, ‘Heav'n to my aid it's inspiration brought. “Appease this senseless strife,” I cried, “which flows “From zeal misguided, big with future woes. “Since thus Lusignan wills, no more my voice “His purpos'd resignation shall oppose: “Take in his room the minion of your choice! “Let Conrad and his crew in splendid guilt rejoice! XXVIII “Be their's the insults of the Pagan host, “Emboldened by their treasons, to correct; “Be their's the charge, your desolated coast “From ravage and destruction to protect: “But let Lusignan, whom ye thus reject, “To climes more worthy of his virtues steer, “Where nought with Judah shall his thoughts connect, “Save, when of her misfortunes he shall hear, “Compassion from his eye may force a pitying tear. XXIX “His high endowments, which ye blindly scorn, “His merits, which so foully ye betray, “Th' imperial throne of Cyprus shall adorn. “There may he long maintain his righteous sway, “And to remote posterity convey “Unsullied honour and a peaceful crown! “May future joys his past-gone woes repay! “May him successive heroes proudly own “The founder of their state, and source of their renown!” XXX ‘I said. Lusignan caught my outstretch'd hand, ‘And, as the dictates of his soul he spoke, ‘From factious Otho and his trait'rous band ‘Exulting shouts of clam'rous transport broke. “Let him,” they cried, “his resignation cloak “With such pretences as may gild his shame; “While we propitious influences invoke, “To guide our Monarch in the paths of fame, “And sanctify his just and now establish'd claim!” XXXI ‘Advancing forward, on Montferrat's head ‘Burgundia's Duke the golden circlet plac'd, ‘And o'er his back the royal mantle spread: ‘Then, summoning the gazing croud, in haste ‘To the chief fane their boist'rous course they trac'd, ‘There to complete their bold and impious deed, ‘And consecrate a pow'r by crimes debas'd. ‘But otherwise insulted Heav'n decreed, ‘And 'midst it's triumph doom'd successful guilt to bleed. XXXII ‘Oh blind to destiny, and slave to hope! ‘Still will presumptuous man controul disdain, ‘Still will he give unbridled passion scope, ‘And, fondly grasping at distinctions vain, ‘Attempt by crimes a fleeting sway to gain? ‘Thus Conrad, with pre-eminence elate, ‘Led to the temple his tumultuous train, ‘And ey'd with joy his unaccustom'd state, ‘Unconscious of the ills prepar'd by vengeful fate. XXXIII ‘He reach'd the fane, and the far-dazzling throne ‘Bedeck'd with gold and brilliant gems he view'd, ‘When two strange youths, who silent and unknown ‘Mix'd with the croud within the portal stood, ‘Rush'd forward, and with salutation rude ‘Their murd'rous poniards buried in his side. ‘Stagg'ring he fell, and with his gushing blood ‘He breath'd his soul, the judgment to abide ‘Of Him, whose high behest his arrogance defied. XXXIV ‘With shouts of frantic rage the city rung. ‘Eager to know whence rose the tumult new, ‘With sudden impulse from my couch I sprung, ‘And with Lusignan, and the chosen few ‘Who shar'd our councils, tow'rds the temple flew. ‘We met the multitude who Conrad bore: ‘Death o'er his cheeks had spread his pallid hue, ‘His manly bosom was distain'd with gore, ‘And still of passions strong his brow the vestige wore. XXXV ‘While yet, impress'd with pity, I survey'd ‘All that remain'd of him, whose spirit proud ‘It's mad ambition lately had display'd, ‘With eager haste and exclamations loud ‘Tow'rds the sad spot approach'd the busy croud. ‘The two Assassins manacled they brought. ‘With more than human confidence endow'd, ‘They gaz'd, as if they peril heeded nought, ‘And smil'd, as if a deed of glory they had wrought. XXXVI ‘I bade them say, with what accurs'd intent, ‘Which neither fear nor danger could restrain, ‘They thus to Acre had their travel bent, ‘And, by what Dæmon urg'd, they dar'd prophane ‘With royal blood the consecrated fane. ‘As if prepar'd our judgment to abide, ‘Erect they stood, and, as with fierce disdain ‘And mingled joy Montferrat's corse they ey'd, ‘With dignified address the elder youth replied: XXXVII “Brethren we are, and subjects of the Prince, “Whom men the Antient of the Mountain call. “Their firm attachment earnest to evince, “No pains, no death, his vassals can appal: “They scorn whate'er of peril may befal; “At his command the craggy rock they climb, “And confident in duty headlong fall; “Thro' Asia's bounds, and Europe's distant clime, “His word their zeal impels with energy sublime. XXXVIII “By him commission'd, hither we repair'd “To wreak his vengeance on Montferrat's head, “Who on his brother wreck'd at Tyre had dar'd “To perpetrate a foul and trait'rous deed. “Our daggers made the faithless tyrant bleed. “Lead us to death! unlock the welcome gate “Of promis'd transports, where our spirits, freed “From mortal 'cumbrance and beyond your hate, “Shall triumph in the joys which loyalty await.” XXXIX ‘They led the bold Enthusiasts to their doom, ‘And, while regret in ev'ry breast awoke, ‘We bad for Conrad straight prepare the tomb. ‘Meantime I thus th' assembled Chiefs bespoke: “Since thus the savage and misguided stroke ‘Of vengeful fury has Montferrat slain, “Without delay the aid of Heav'n invoke, “To guide your choice tow'rds one, whose worthy reign “May heal intestine feuds, and Judah's cause maintain.” XL ‘Forthwith the Chiefs commenc'd their grave debate; ‘When Austria's Duke, whose deeply rankling breast ‘Teem'd with revenge and disappointed hate, ‘Eager their solemn council to molest, ‘With crafty Burgundy the croud address'd, ‘And sought again t'entice them to their lure: ‘As if with democratic zeal impress'd, ‘Their Sov'reign Rights they urg'd them to insure, ‘And 'gainst the Princes rail'd with obloquy impure. XLI ‘But fruitless now their artifices prov'd, ‘Nor to their views would now the people bend. ‘By brave Montferrat's recent murder mov'd, ‘They felt their hearts to slighted Heav'n ascend, ‘And fear'd by fresh presumption to offend: ‘No clamours rude arose; but, struck with awe, ‘They seem'd fresh chastisements to apprehend. ‘The sudden change their guilty leaders saw, ‘And sought the means themselves from peril to withdraw. XLII ‘Otho took refuge with his Gallic band, ‘While Leopold, determin'd to retreat ‘From wrong'd Judæa, hasten'd to the strand, ‘And with his host embark'd on board his fleet, ‘In other climes preparing to complete ‘The foul revenge which rankled in his heart. ‘As quiver'd in the breeze his flowing sheet, ‘The people, lately victims of his art, ‘Contemptuously beheld the recreant Prince depart. XLIII ‘Tranquillity thus visiting again ‘Those walls from which so lately she had flown, ‘The Chiefs proclaim'd that Henry of Champaigne, ‘Whose prowess oft in perils had been shewn, ‘And whose superior qualities were known ‘To all who war's alarms with him had shar'd, ‘Should fill Lusignan's agitated throne. ‘Rejoicing numbers him their King declar'd, ‘And with becoming pomp to Acre's fane repair'd. XLIV ‘Now thro' the camp I publish'd my intent, ‘To seek fair England's lov'd domains once more: ‘Our barks were fitted, and our sails were bent, ‘And all prepar'd to quit Judæa's shore, ‘When lo! from Saladin Orasmin bore ‘Proffers of friendship and fair terms of peace. “Let us,” said he, “to Palestine restore “Her long-lost quiet: let our contests cease; “Let us our wearied hosts from further toil release. XLV “Thus speaks the King, whom Asia's realms obey. “Far as from Sorec's stream to Acre's plain, “Let all the coast confess the Christian sway; “Let Ascalon to neither pow'r remain; “Let either people amity maintain, “And either confine be securely pass'd: “If English Richard and his Princely train “Accept these proffers, let our compact last, “'Till thrice the glorious sun complete his circuit vast.” XLVI ‘The Chieftain said, and thus I straight rejoin'd. “Thy Sov'reign's offers fair and candid seem; “And, from my friends should they acceptance find, “Our full consent expedient I esteem. “After long struggles Judah to redeem, “Th' auspicious moment joyfully we hail, “When peace, Heav'n's choicest boon, again shall beam, “When war no longer shall her coasts assail, “And her lost sons no more humanity shall wail. XLVII “But say, illustrious Persian Chief! whence spring “These unexpected proffers, whence arise “These peaceful overtures of Asia's King?” “My Prince,” replied he, “bad me not disguise “The cause, why thus in amicable ties “He seeks with your's his int'rests to unite; “And why he thus relinquishes the prize, “So often and so well maintain'd in fight, “While yet immense his force and unimpair'd his might. XLVIII “To you, who often in the hostile field “His brave and countless armaments have view'd, “His vast resources amply are reveal'd. “No wish your menac'd vengeance to elude, “No apprehension from the war pursued, “Lead him to modify ambition's plan, “And thus to terminate the bloody feud. “'Twas thou who taught'st him Christian worth to scan, “And 'mid the shock of war to feel himself a Man. XLIX “From early youth inur'd to feats of arms, “Not all thy fame at Cæsarea gain'd, “Nor Acre's fall, inspir'd him with alarms. “At Jaffa boldly he the strife maintain'd, “Where well thy practic'd valour he sustain'd “And dy'd with gore the long-contested strand. “Nor had he now to make this proffer deign'd, “Had not thy virtues, and thy self-command, “Mov'd him to own thy worth and court thy friendly hand. L “When, by domestic anguish most distress'd, “Thou nobly sent'st him young Melcalez' bier, “As once again his darling son he press'd, “And on his bosom dropt a father's tear, “He learnt thy gen'rous feelings to revere. “But, when thy praise he heard Miralis speak, “And grateful tribute to the doctrines bear, “Which taught thee to befriend the poor and weak, “His heart impell'd him thus thy amity to seek. LI “Since, then, th' Eternal Pow'r has stamp'd each mind, “Pure and congenial, in one common mould, “Henceforward may your virtues be combin'd! “Oh! let your spirits, free and uncontroul'd, “Their kindred gallantry and worth unfold: “Let both obey approving Heav'n's behest! “Angels and men with transport shall behold “Your hands the ravages of war arrest, “And peace again shall smile, and Judah shall be bless'd!” LII ‘As thus Orasmin spoke, th' applauding croud, ‘Mov'd by the frank avowal of the Chief, ‘Burst forth in shouts and acclamations loud, ‘While we, rejoicing in the prompt relief ‘Of suff'ring Judah's long-protracted grief, ‘Prepar'd the solemn bus'ness to transact. ‘With mutual confidence, and transcripts brief, ‘On either side we fram'd the high compact, ‘And call'd on conscious Heav'n to ratify the act. LIII ‘Thus did my arm the glorious work complete, ‘Appointed for me by propitious fate. ‘I found the Christians harrass'd by defeat, ‘By famine spent, and urg'd by Pagan hate: ‘I left them prosp'rous, dignified, and great. ‘Before I came, their vanquish'd Monarch held ‘A barren sceptre, and an empty state: ‘Th' invaders stern I fought, their pow'r I quell'd, ‘And Asia's force, tho' led by Saladin, repell'd. LIV ‘When Philip, traitor to the sacred cause, ‘From Palestine retir'd, I persever'd: ‘When Conrad, trampling on Religion's laws, ‘Rebellion's black and fatal standard rear'd, ‘The champion of allegiance I appear'd: ‘While Austria, and Burgundia's faithless Duke, ‘Bought by the foe, from honour's dictates veer'd, ‘The throne of Saladin I roughly shook, ‘And from the puissant King full retribution took. LV ‘When, for two tedious years, proud Acre's tow'rs ‘Against associate Europe's force had stood, ‘When Philip vainly had led on his pow'rs, ‘And, all unequal to the conflict rude, ‘Sank in the midst of Gallia's noblest blood, ‘The stern barbarians fearlessly I brav'd. ‘'Twas mine the glorious contest to conclude: ‘The shatter'd remnant of his host I sav'd, ‘And high o'er Acre's walls my conq'ring banners wav'd. LVI ‘Let Jaffa's plain, and Cæsarea's strand, ‘The toils which Richard there encounter'd speak, ‘When, spent his forces, and reduc'd his band, ‘He dar'd the Saracenic force to seek; ‘When their firm legions he prevail'd to break, ‘To crush their chiefs, their armies to o'erwhelm, ‘And on their Monarch his revenge to wreak: ‘When fame and victory grac'd his bloody helm, ‘And English valour sav'd Judæa's tott'ring realm. LVII ‘And was it, therefore, from a Christian King ‘That he thus sharply should be doom'd to feel ‘Whate'er of woe from jealous hate can spring? ‘Was it for this that Philip dar'd to seal ‘With John his league perfidious, and to steal ‘Like midnight thief on fair Normannia's coast? ‘Say, was it therefore, that with foul appeal ‘His delegates led on their trait'rous host, ‘Insulting Albion's shores with loud and impious boast? LVIII ‘Let Austria say, if therefore, when impell'd ‘By ocean's rage on his unhallow'd shore, ‘His dungeons deep a captive Monarch held: ‘If all that deadly rancour had in store ‘On him defenceless he presum'd to pour? ‘Or if, unable longer to withhold ‘From Henry's gripe his prey, for paltry ore, ‘For promis'd heaps of fascinating gold, ‘He therefore England's King to yonder Tyrant sold? LIX ‘Let him, my false accuser, now confess, ‘If ought but base and sordid hope of gain ‘Mov'd him thus long to keep me in duress, ‘Within those walls where grief and terror reign, ‘Whose mould'ring tow'rs unnumber'd murders stain, ‘And where the victims of his ruthless sway, ‘Unknown, unpitied, and unwept remain, ‘Wasting their slow and dreary hours away, ‘Amid surrounding scenes of horror and dismay? LX ‘Him to the proof before ye all I dare, ‘Howe'er with av'rice or resentment fraught, ‘Howe'er in Austria's gains intent to share, ‘Or prompt to crown the ills his malice wrought! ‘Those heroes, who beneath my banner fought, ‘Who, when for glory and for life we strove, ‘'Mid Pagan bands unfading laurels sought, ‘Will best the falsehood of his charges prove, ‘And from my injur'd fame his calumnies remove. LXI ‘To you, brave Chiefs! who now in solemn state ‘Assembled sit, I make my firm appeal. ‘Redeem me from yon proud oppressor's hate! ‘'Tis your's the Tyrant's baseness to reveal, ‘Your's is the pow'r a Monarch's woes to heal, ‘Again to place him on his rightful throne. ‘Your gen'rous spirits will his suff'rings feel! ‘Let your impartial justice now be shewn; ‘Defend my honour, Peers! as ye revere your own.’ LXII The warlike King thus ended his defence. Throughout the crouded hall no sound arose, But all seem'd wrapt in silence and suspense. As when, no longer pent in caverns close, Ungovern'd winds a river's course oppose, Their furious blasts its fetter'd waves restrain, And lock it's current in a brief repose; Soon as subsides their potent force, again The stream releas'd bursts forth and rushes to the main: LXIII So stood the Peers in mute attention bound, Enchanted by the magic of his tongue, And ev'ry sense to agony was wound. But soon the vaulted roof with plaudits rung, When England's Peers tow'rds their lov'd Monarch sprung, When him the Champion of their Isle they hail'd, And on his neck in heart-felt rapture hung: Then transport and unbridled joy prevail'd, And shouts of wild delight the Tyrant's ear assail'd. LXIV Soon as the first glad tumult was suppress'd, With hand outstretch'd, the Prelate of Cologne The dignified assembly thus address'd. “Princes! if well your sentiments I've known, “Your loyal hearts the force of truth will own: “Richard, redeem'd from all imputed blame, “Your suffrage shall restore to Albion's throne, “And him, with voice unanimous, proclaim “Pre-eminent alike in valour, worth and fame.” LXV Not otherwise, than when, thro' Heav'n's expanse, From the dark bosom of a nitrous cloud, With coruscations bright quick light'nings glance, Follow responsive thunders deep and loud; So from the pitying and applauding croud Rose pealing confirmations of his vote. On his empurpled throne the Tyrant proud Trembled: him now accusing conscience smote, And mingled ills at hand with terrors more remote. LXVI “Was it for this,” he cried, “insidious Fiend! “Thy double oracles my hopes inflam'd? “Was this the tempting prize, the glorious end, “At which, by thee misled, I vainly aim'd? “Where are the terrors which thy guile had fram'd “To crush my rival and confirm his doom? “Behold! his full acquittal is proclaim'd: “He lives his pristine station to resume, “By my defeat more fresh his honour now will bloom. LXVII “If thus your promis'd triumphs are fulfill'd, “If thus with disappointment ye repay “The machinations by yourselves instill'd, “The laws of Heav'n 'twere wiser to obey, “And like the herd to own it's juster sway. “Hence, loath'd deceiver! leave me to repel “The dangers which invade me while I may! “Thus I renounce thy pow'r, abjure thy spell, “And bid thee elsewhere seek a proselyte for Hell!” LXVIII Straightway, descending from th' imperial seat, With simulated, ecstasy he rush'd, The destin'd victim of his fraud to greet. Drops of regret from either eyelid gush'd, And, spite of art, unconsciously he blush'd, As England's King in his embrace he press'd. With wonder struck, the gazing Peers were hush'd, When Richard, with a look which scorn express'd, Repell'd his proffer'd grace, and thus the Prince address'd. LXIX “Henry! forbear, nor, with pretences weak “Of sudden feelings and ingenuous shame, “An injur'd King's regard attempt to seek. “Do'st thou esteem me so effete and tame, “As to conceive thy artifice can claim “A pow'r to cloak thy aggravated wrong? “To me his love and hatred are the same, “Who persecutes the helpless, courts the strong, “And mocks the rights which to humanity belong. LXX “What was thy conduct, when thy fortune smil'd, “And fate consign'd me to thy dreary tow'r? “No kindred pity then my pains beguil'd; “Then her worst ills calamity might show'r, “Then want might pang, and sorrow might devour; “Thou shed'st no tears, no wish thy soul impell'd “To mitigate the horrors of thy pow'r: “My worst endurance calmly was beheld, “And Richard's suff'rings then his Tyrant's triumphs swell'd. LXXI “Now, when Germania's potent Chiefs once more “Call me to freedom, break my galling chain, “And Albion's sceptre to my hand restore, “To court my friendship speciously you deign, “You drop the tear, commiseration feign, “And greetings foreign to your heart repeat. “Know, base dissembler! that with like disdain “Your terrors and your blandishments I treat, “With like contempt your hate and amity I meet!” LXXII He said, and follow'd by the splendid host Forth from the hall triumphantly he went. Henry remain'd, in deep reflection lost, His eyes intently on the portal bent, While warring passions in his bosom pent, And rage, to phrenzy wound, consum'd his soul. When lo! the vaulted roof with cries was rent, Sounds of despair were heard and curses foul, And 'mid the clamour strange rose many a ghastly howl. LXXIII “Heard ye yon din?” the trembling Prince exclaim'd, “Methought, amid those exclamations dire, “Some ruthless Dæmon my sad doom proclaim'd. “Mark where he sits, enthron'd in clouds of fire! “Save me, Oh save me from his blasting ire! “See, where around him troops of spectres stand! “Now, 'gainst me lone and helpless they conspire, “Now, arm'd with vengeance, view th' insatiate band, “As each his wings extends, and waves his threat'ning hand!” LXXIV “My Liege!” said Adolph, “no such sounds we heard, “Nor have such phantoms, as your words bespeak, “To us, who here observant stand, appear'd.” “'Tis false,” cried Henry: “see, their ranks they break, “With flight abrupt and swift descent they seek “To pierce my bosom with a blazing dart! “Hark! heard ye not that loud and piercing shriek? “The venom spreads with agonizing smart, “Mounts to my bursting brain and racks my burning heart!” LXXV As thus he said, fix'd and entranc'd he stood, Haggard his mien, and desolate his air: Scarcely his heart propell'd his mantling blood, And wildly started his diverging hair, As, gazing upward with distracted stare, He saw, 'mid mingled flames and sulph'rous smoke, Grim Belial's hideous form. With vengeful glare The Fiend survey'd him, and, while thunders broke, In accents harsh and loud the Tyrant thus bespoke. LXXVI “If thus my presence fills thy soul with fear, “What wilt thou feel, when thy devoted head “Eternal torments is condemn'd to bear; “When vengeful ministers around thee spread “Their toils infernal and their engines dread, “When fate's black banner is on high unfurl'd, “When hope for ever from thy soul is fled, “And, 'mid the fragments of a shatter'd world, “Thro' warring elements thy shiv'ring ghost is hurl'd? LXXVII “Can Heav'n by thin hypocrisy be mock'd? “Know, vile Apostate! that with tenfold pow'r “It's ample hoards of vengeance are unlock'd. “Lo! where around thee thick'ning tempests lour; “The deadly storm on thee prepares to show'r: “Before it's rage thy fainting spirit shrinks, “Flames scorch, and never-dying worms devour; “At every agonizing pore it drinks “Essential fire, and deep in Hell's dark caverns sinks! LXXVIII “Such are the pangs which dastard guilt await. “Would'st thou escape them, and 'mongst Dæmons hold “A just pre-eminence and seemly state? “Would'st thou with Satan's Chieftains be enroll'd? “Shake off upbraiding conscience, and new mould “To daring enterprize thy tim'rous soul. “Where'er thou bend'st thy way let men behold “Thy blasting influence and thy dread controul, “And curse their ling'ring fate 'midst tortures new and foul. LXXIX “Haste to Sicilia's blood-polluted shore: “Break the recesses of the royal dead; “On proud Salerno wide destruction pour, “Horror, despair, and desolation spread; “On Heav'n's anointed fiery vengeance shed; “Stretch'd on the rack her tortur'd nobles strain; “On brave and loyal Giordano's head “Place an ignited crown, 'till, mad with pain, “His eye-balls start convuls'd, and bursts his kindling brain. LXXX “So may'st thou deprecate th' avenging host: “So, when thou stand'st before th' infernal throne, “Thou may'st with confidence proclaim thy boast. “Then, when thy high atchievements shall be shewn, “Thy blazon'd crimes, thy meed by murders won, “Applauding Dæmons shall thy merits tell; “Satan thy sanguinary worth shall own, “Loud shall the chorus of thy praises swell, “And Henry's fame shall grace the chronicles of Hell!” LXXXI Thus spake th' insulting Fiend, and, with a look Which pierc'd the trembling Prince, aloft he pass'd. High in the murky air his plumes he shook, And, as his bulk he rear'd with impulse vast, The Pow'rs which rul'd the air, with dread aghast, Survey'd him tow'ring. On his course he held, While round him howl'd the devastating blast: From ocean's caves his billows huge it swell'd, Tore thro' his beds profound, and far his tides impell'd. LXXXII Earth from it's centre deep confess'd the shock: Back to their source the foaming rivers flow'd; The mountains totter'd, and the threat'ning rock, Which like the wreck of suff'ring nature shew'd, Rent from it's antient base the champaign strew'd. The full-orb'd moon, which, cloath'd in radiance white, Thro' Heav'n's wide arch majestically rode, Felt his dire presence, own'd his baleful might, And, veil'd in sanguine clouds, no more led on the night. LXXXIII With crash sublime horrific thunders peal'd, And quick responsive light'nings, as they gleam'd With sulph'rous flash, the potent Fiend reveal'd. The mighty ruler of the storm he seem'd: His sable locks in wild disorder stream'd, Widely his sounding pinions he display'd, While ghastly spectres round him hoarsely scream'd; Pois'd in mid sky, his fatal course he stay'd, And fill'd with conscious pride th' aërial strife survey'd. LXXXIV But sad remembrance soon his thoughts engag'd: No more the thunder's roll, the light'ning's glare, Th' attendant Dæmons' cry, his mind assuag'd. Like meteors glancing thro' the gloomy air, Or comets brandishing their deadly hair Portending war and woe, his eye-balls flam'd: He gaz'd, and with a voice which fell despair Denoted, and bespoke his rage untam'd, While echo'd Heav'n's high vault, th' imperious Fiend exclaim'd. LXXXV “Cease, ye contending elements! to rage; “Your caves remote, ye threat'ning tempests! seek, “Nor longer unavailing warfare wage; “No more around me, rattling thunders! break, “Nor heav'n with sulph'rous gleam, ye light'nings! streak; “And ye, attendant Fiends! no longer swell “The song of vengeance which we fail'd to wreak: “For unprotected virtue breaks your spell, “And man triumphant mocks the vanquish'd pow'rs of hell. LXXXVI “Not thus his mission Moloch bold forsook: “Exulting he return'd from Albion's land, “While loud applauses Pandæmonium shook. “But we, the glorious enterprise who plann'd, “On whom devolv'd our Sov'reign's dread command, “Stamp'd with dishonour, branded with defeat, “How in his awful presence shall we stand, “When Richard re-assumes his royal seat, “And Gallia's baffled King his dreaded wrath shall meet? LXXXVII “But is the force of hell-born vengeance spent? “Are there not yet exhaustless stores of hate, “Mischiefs unnumber'd, in her caverns pent? “Shall we ignobly shun the great debate, “And, while our victim holds his antient state, “Debas'd and stigmatiz'd our glories veil, “And crouch in abject awe? forbid it fate! “Tho' here in foreign climes our plans may fail, “Domestic discontents and treasons may prevail. LXXXVIII “Come then, in all the plenitude array'd “Of ruthless pow'r, ye ministers of ill! “Be here your engines terrible display'd, “Ye potent masters of the human will! “Hasten your Monarch's purpose to fulfil; “Bring hither Sophistry, Deceit and Lies, “Prepare your secret poisons to instil, “Which slumb'ring judgment craftily surprize, “Before whose influence dire abash'd allegiance flies. LXXXIX “From Hell's recess, where plans of general woe “Employ thee, False Philosophy awake! “Let Albion's shores thy blasting presence know; “There may'st thou order and religion shake, “There, deep in blood, thy thirst unsated slake, “And rear aloft thy snake-encircled helm; “'Till trembling crouds their antient faith forsake, “'Till frantic mobs the monarchy o'erwhelm, “And ruin wide involve the desolated realm. XC “Thither repair thy standard to unfold: “While round thee far th' ensanguin'd torrent streams, “And madness and despair their station hold, “Disseminate afar thy flatt'ring schemes, “Thy plans of conquest, thy delusive dreams “Of crimes, of triumphs, of subverted thrones. “Urge thy fleet wings; th' eventful moment teems: “Methinks already, 'midst her heart-felt groans, “Her parricidal wounds, our empire England owns!” XCI Thus with terrific voice the Dæmon spoke. Hell's deep foundations trembled at his word; Again around him pealing thunders broke, Blue light'nings flash'd, tremendous tempests roar'd, And bursting clouds in cataracts were pour'd: Borne on the angry winds, in dreadful choir, Utt'ring loud shrieks, unnumber'd phantoms soar'd, Unsightly spectres, siends of aspect dire, In sulph'rous smoke involv'd, or rob'd in lurid fire. XCII Above them all, her ample pinions wav'd The potent Dæmon False Philosophy: The jarring strife of elements she brav'd, And, as she mounted, her ill-omen'd cry, Foreboding unknown horrors, rent the sky. Alluring was her look, her tints were fair, Smooth was her brow, and melting was her eye, Her cheek with smiles was dimpled, and her air Of all that charm'd the sense disclos'd a semblance rare. XCIII A magic mirror in her hand she rear'd, On whose extended surface, polish'd bright, The gay temptations of her rule appear'd. There was pourtray'd young reason's dawning light, Dispersing superstition's gloomy night; There nations freed from thraldom were beheld, Restor'd to liberty and nature's right, While Monarchs from their mould'ring states impell'd, And law and faith o'erthrown, her impious triumph swell'd. XCIV With arms outspread Humanity was view'd, Courting the giddy croud to venture near, Then sternly wading thro' a sea of blood. Anon would Sensibility appear, On a dead sparrow drop a ready tear, And plant her dagger in a parent's breast. Now meek Philanthropy her palms would rear, And talk of peace; then shake her crimson'd crest, While thousands writh'd beneath her pitiless behest. XCV A flowing robe, of empyrean hue, Folded around her to conceal her shape, And shroud her foul and monst'rous limbs from view: A compound strange of tyger and of ape, Where many a filthy mouth was seen to gape, Distilling human gore, and dropping gall, Whence Treason, Rapine, Perj'ry, Murder, Rape, And all that tortur'd suff'rance can appal, Or wring the soul, were seen in countless swarms to crawl. XCVI Tow'rds Belial bending her resounding plumes, Loudly she thus the lordly Fiend address'd. “Why from my caves remote and secret glooms, “Where I repos'd in uncongenial rest, “Disown'd my power, my energy suppress'd, “Provokes me now thy invocation dread? “On what devoted land, what clime unblest, “Must the stern vengeance of my arm be spread? “Where shall my stores of wrath, yet unemploy'd, be shed?” XCVII “Brave spirit,” cried he, “well thy zeal I know, “And gladly thy thrice-welcome presence hail. “On Albion's realm prepare thy pow'r to shew: “Let thy commanding arts her sons assail; “There all thy incantations dire detail, “High on her cliffs thy blazing torch display, “And o'er her laws and government prevail. “Now for the proof. Let Hell direct our way, “And stamp on Richard's fall our long contested sway!” XCVIII He ceas'd. Around th' infernal chorus burst, Of woe prophetic, fill'd with threat'nings loud, And furious boast of their intent accurs'd. Thro' the mid-air, envelop'd in a cloud Of pitchy darkness, rode the Dæmons proud, Employ'd their fatal purpose to disclose, And organize the mischiefs they had vow'd. Soon reach'd they where, unconscious of new woes, From ocean's green expanse the Queen of Islands rose. END OF BOOK XI. BOOK XII. ARGUMENT. Operations of the Dæmons in England, which are rendered abortive by the arrival and conduct of Richard. I Darkness, dismay, and terror round them reign'd, And still more horrible the tempest grew, While Hell's dread delegates their course maintain'd. As nearer to the destin'd spot they drew, They class'd their arguments and pleas untrue, Whose fascinating charms the croud might lead The tempting paths of ruin to pursue. With savage transport as they scann'd the deed, They deem'd their triumph sure, and hail'd their glorious meed. II As thus on high exultingly they soar'd, Opposing tempests seem'd to shake the air; New meteors darted, adverse thunders roar'd, And, 'mid the cliffs and promontories bare, Responsive light'nings, with sulphureous glare, Shed o'er the gloom profound their dazzling gleam; While from the mass loud yellings of despair Discordant burst, and many a fearful scream, Like those of suff'ring ghosts on feign'd Cocytus' stream. III Dread was the conflict, hideous was the war Of fires electric, and across the sky The mingling elements resounded far. Belial their impulse felt: with scowling eye He view'd the meteors, and erecting high His princely front, with proud disdain beheld Th' infernal band, whom Moloch charg'd to try Their impious artifice, abash'd, repell'd, And forc'd to quit their prize, by English virtue quell'd. IV Like Ætna, when from forth it's caverns deep A fiery column seems at Heav'n to aim, And molten lavas down it's huge sides sweep, Burst his ungovern'd wrath: contempt and shame Consum'd his breast with agonizing flame. “What leads ye thus,” he cried, “your flight to trace? “Avenging Satan shall your doom proclaim; “All hell shall echo with your foul disgrace, “And tenfold pangs reward your dereliction base!” V “No treach'rous purpose, no occasion slight,” Him answer'd Civil Discord, “leads my band “Thus to impel from Albion's shores their flight. “Appointed there, by Moloch's dread command, “To spread contagion o'er the suff'ring land, “And shake the old foundations of the state, “Our efforts well fulfill'd the woes he plann'd: “Swift and remorseless ministers of fate, “We stretch'd our ample rule, our desolating hate. VI “Had'st thou, imperious Fiend! as well atchiev'd “The purpose by our potent Monarch taught; “If the design by him so well conceiv'd, “Mature in wisdom, with experience fraught, “Thy boasted pow'r successfully had wrought, “Ne'er would our half-accomplish'd toils have fail'd: “Then joyful might we hell's domains have sought, “And prov'd how far our energy prevail'd, “While our triumphant host all Pandæmonium hail'd. VII “But when, encourag'd most our task to urge, “We look'd our daring object to complete, “When bleeding England crouch'd beneath our scourge, “Thy blasted enterprise, thy mean defeat, “Unnerv'd our arms, and drove us to retreat. “His force disbanded, lost his fleeting sway, “John yields to Richard his imperial seat; “While we, thy influence curs'd compell'd t' obey, “Nor less disgrac'd, resume tow'rds Satan's court our way.” VIII Thus spake the Fiend courageous, and abash'd Stood Belial self-convicted, while around Their full-orb'd shields the furious Dæmons clash'd, And high arose the soul-appalling sound. Awhile his voice the madd'ning clamour drown'd, And oft in vain to still their rage he tried, While his black brow with indignation frown'd, And high his bosom heav'd with conscious pride. At length the tumult ceas'd, and thus he loudly cried. IX “May ev'ry plague which spirits can appal, “And all the curses of insulted hell, “On thy foul tongue, presumptuous railer! fall. “Dar'st thou, malignant imp! with rancour fell “On false constructions of my high feats dwell? “Hop'st thou remission of thy pangs to gain? “Contemptuously thy slanders I repel, “And treat thy obloquy with stern disdain. “Ne'er can my known deserts thy venom'd charges stain. X “Know, base defamer of my great renown! “When thou disown'd and stigmatiz'd shalt pine, “Immortal wreaths my tow'ring front shall crown: “For me their songs of triumph Fiends shall join, “When, perfected our new and bold design, “Beneath our sway shall bend this prostrate state. “Then, when fresh glories and success are mine, “Shrink from my vengeance; trembling then await “A retribution sure from Belial's endless hate!” XI “Cease this insensate brawl! let judgment clear,” Cried False Philosophy, “her seat resume: “Calmly let each my sober mandate hear. “With high commission charg'd, behold! I come “The darken'd world with novel lights t' illume; “Thro' seas of doubt my hand shall guide the helm, “My mirror shall disperse religion's gloom, “Inundate with new-fangled codes the realm, “And law, and government, and England's self o'erwhelm. XII “'Tis mine on man's credulity to build, “To work upon the rude and vacant mind, “Which ne'er the ray of wholesome knowledge fill'd, “Which, deaf to reason, to example blind, “Expects in sophistry the truth to find. “These are my darling engines, these I prime “With doctrines to corrupt the heart design'd, “Then lead them by degrees from crime to crime, “'Till nations swell my train and own my pow'r sublime. XIII “Too long by fate from enterprise restrain'd, “I burn my energy to signalize, “And dignify the freedom I have gain'd. “Before us, lo! our scene of high emprize: “In one great cause unite, my bold Allies! “Let us our utmost force combine, to cope “With England's Monarch who our host defies: “Let us to vengeance give unbounded scope, “Nor cease, 'till full matur'd we view our budding hope!” XIV She said. The Fiends, appeas'd by her discourse, And anxious now to join their common aid, Address'd themselves for flight. With outcries hoarse, And threats of woe, their wide wings they display'd, And cut the air: nor was their impulse stay'd, 'Till, north of London's princely tow'rs, they view'd, Extending far it's deep-entangled shade Impervious to the sun, an ancient wood, Where many a moss-grown oak and tow'ring chesnut stood. XV “Behold,” cried False Philosophy, “where best “Congenial darkness may your group conceal; “While I, alone, in borrow'd semblance dress'd, “To bold Fitz-Osbert may my plans reveal, “And frame with him devices apt to steal “The unsuspecting suff'rage of the croud. “Soon as your succour requisite I feel, “My voice shall reach you with a summons loud: “Then rush to perpetrate the mischiefs you have vow'd.” XVI Thus saying, from her lips distended wide She blew a vapour, which with influence drear Within it's atmosphere the crew might hide, Lest, to some passenger approaching near, Their forms uncouth and ghastly might appear. Then, her dire quest impatient to renew, With outspread wing she 'gan her course to steer, Nor ceas'd her baleful travel to pursue, 'Till the far-stretching walls of London met her view. XVII Now to Fitz-Osbert sought she to impart Her purposes of meditated wrong. Cool in pursuit of ill, his callous heart Knew all the turns which to deceit belong. Grave with the old, attractive with the young, With winding art he prob'd the secret soul; While, by the magic of his guileful tongue, O'er their charm'd hearts insensibly he stole, And held their captive wills with mild but strong controul. XVIII Intent his private int'rest to pursue, Of moral right or wrong he seldom thought: Whene'er the flatt'ring object met his view, With zeal deprav'd the readiest means he sought, And fortune to his wish obedient wrought. The servile arts of flatt'ry he could try, When harsh necessity submission taught; But, when successful, his demeanour high Princes would proudly check, and potentates defy. XIX He aim'd at pow'r, but not for public good: Tho' this pretext, in each insidious speech, He us'd to cloak his plans jejune and crude. On public grievances he oft would preach, Insult the laws, the government impeach; The People's Sov'reignty he would avow, The holy right of Insurrection teach, And how to bring their lordly tyrants low, And how to make the Crown before it's vassals bow. XX The talents which from nature he enjoy'd, Great, comprehensive, and by toil improv'd, For purposes unworthy he employ'd. Thro' vice's path unblushingly he rov'd, And all her varied blandishments had prov'd: Nor, wrinkled tho' his front and hoar his head, Left he the follies which his youth had mov'd; For, tho' to passion he had long been dead, A concubine for shew still shar'd his shameless bed. XXI Night had her zenith reach'd, when, with his crew As late he revell'd, him the Dæmon found. From hand to hand the well-charg'd goblet flew, Chaplets of fading flow'rs their temples crown'd, And mirth and noisy laughter reign'd around. Yet often, when the shallow jest was past, Their host would broach his politics unsound, His sarcasms on establishments would cast, And drink to the success of his conceptions vast. XXII And oft the sluggard people he would blame, Who, tho' by fortune's attributes unblest, Preserv'd allegiance, and with suff'rance tame Their native rights and inborn power suppress'd. The maudlin band his reas'ning's force confess'd, And, as their voices tun'd the factious strain, Whose chorus loud their ardent hope express'd, The sparkling bowl they persever'd to drain, And hail'd the blissful hour when anarchy should reign. XXIII When all were now with full libations hot, Fitz-Osbert rising beckon'd for a pause: “Be not our Baldock's health,” he said, “forgot: “He, the firm champion of our glorious cause, “As well his toils deserve, should meet applause. “For who than he more openly has dar'd, “To mock religion, government and laws? “Than him who less for human curbs has car'd, “Who better all the means of tumult has prepar'd?” XXIV As thus he spoke, the Dæmon, who conceal'd The progress of their close cabal had watch'd, Herself, in Baldock's semblance clad, reveal'd. The chamber door she suddenly unlatch'd, And thus exclaim'd abruptly: “Friends attach'd “To freedom and her cause, your Baldock hear: “Mark the new mischiefs which my brain has hatch'd, “And that superior artifice revere, “Which on a moment's base can plans for ages rear. XXV “While here in revelry and wassel loose “Those hours, which greater cares demand, are spent, “Anxious to further our aspiring views, “To scenes of higher aim my steps I bent. “Rife were the tidings of a new event: “Richard redeem'd from rigid Henry's sway, “His favour'd minion, young Blondel, has sent, “His wants before our Regency to lay, “And ascertain the means his ransom to defray. XXVI “Of aids immense he comes empower'd to treat, “And, ere to-morrow's sun his height attain, “The Queen her council has decreed to meet. “Throughout the people apprehensions reign, “Visions of imposts haunt each teeming brain, “And undefin'd suspicions round are spread. “All seek society in doubt to gain: “Here one in mystic silence nods his head, “Some whisper fears, while some more boldly speak their dread. XXVII “With diligence the public marts I sought, “Where growing discontent I tried to nurse, “And captivating schemes of tumult taught: “Then quickly hasten'd to the crouded Burse, “And join'd the well-fed citizens to curse “The weighty burthens which the state requir'd. “As I declaim'd, each usurer hugg'd his purse, “And, as my well-wrought tale his fancy fir'd, “Each, to secure his pelf, with heavy steps retir'd. XXVIII “To many a convent and religious house “I pass'd, and, as on subsidies I spoke, “I found my eloquence their zeal arouse. “While thus my efforts discontent awoke, “And murmurs loud from every quarter broke, “I charged Tresilian with observant heed “The cred'lous mob to fury to provoke, “And, with the dawn, his clam'rous bands to lead “To Smithfield and St. Paul's a mutiny to breed. XXIX “So far then are my projects all mature: “On you their final issue must depend, “'Tis your's their full completion to assure. “Whene'er the hustings proudly you ascend, “To you the raptur'd populace attend, “You the protector of their rights they hail, “The People's Guardian, and the poor man's friend. “Let not, when fortune smiles, your efforts fail, “But to the fav'ring breeze expand your flowing sail!” XXX As thus she spoke, tumultuous plaudits burst: While fresh libations hail'd their welcome guest, The noisy patriots his desert rehears'd. At length, his voice prevailing o'er the rest; Fitz-Osbert thus his bold compeer address'd. “Ere this, my Baldock! thy superior worth “With admiration has my mind impress'd: “Now bow I to the talents which gave birth “To schemes, which may redeem the subjugated earth. XXXI “'Tis true, in desp'rate posture are we plac'd: “Proscrib'd by all, pursued by Richard's hate, “Our faith suspected held, our names disgrac'd, “Our heads obnoxious to a harsher fate. “The rich our practices abhor; the great, “From the excesses of our tutor'd croud, “Prognosticate the downfal of their state, “And, arguing from our principles avow'd, “Trembling foretel the ills which Albion's face may cloud. XXXII “But, if thus desp'rate are our future views, “So desp'rate be the purpose of our soul. “Of ills the lesser prudence bids us chuse. “Our's be the effort fortune to controul, “To snatch at fame, to reach ambition's goal, “And from our past defeats new strength t' assume. “Let each again salute the gen'rous bowl! “To-morrow's sun shall light us to the tomb, “Or view this prostrate land await from us it's doom!” XXXIII He said. The Fiend thus hasten'd to reply. “United in one great and common cause, “On thy superior talents we rely. “Yet, ere we act, a moment let us pause, “Since thus, for more than fame or light applause, “We dare encounter perils yet unknown. “He, who in Civil Broil his weapon draws, “Must trust to energy and force alone: “From his determin'd hand the scabbard must be thrown. XXXIV “Our lines of action we must therefore chuse, “Must strain each nerve, and all that strength can give, “And all that talents can suggest, must use. “Those, who supreme in Richard's favour live, “To check our progress eagerly will strive; “Nor can we hope, that he, against whose sway “We thus conspire, our treasons will forgive. “It well behoves us then our plans to lay, “And frame our great design while safely yet we may. XXXV “When you the cred'lous citizens address, “In terms pathetic for their insults grieve: “Speak of the suff'rings which the state oppress: “With phrase high-sounding, lead them to believe “Their greedy governors their faith deceive, “And drain their purses for their proper use: “Instruct them how their errors to retrieve, “Give hints of fresh oppressions and abuse, “Of plans in embrio yet, and deep-concerted views. XXXVI “'Tis wond'rous how the magic of a word, “With emphasis pronounc'd and boldly vouch'd, “Can fortify an argument absurd. “By hardy lies in fervid language couch'd “The stubborn feelings of a mob are touch'd: “Let thy experienc'd hand but press the spring, “And those, who yesterday obedient crouch'd, “Will make the air with madd'ning tumult ring, “Defy the laws, and mock Religion and their King. XXXVII “Be thine the task their passions to inflame: “Prepare them well, and leave the rest to me. “A scheme I have to bend them to our aim, “To shew how ill the Rights of Man agree, “With what their Lawyers, Priests and Kings decree; “The doctrine of Resistance to instil; “To teach them that, for Nations to be Free, “For Men, born Equal, Nature's scale to fill, “They need but feel their strength and boldly speak their will. XXXVIII “But more of this when fit occasion suits. “My hand shall scatter far rebellion's seed, “And fatal shall be found it's deadly fruits. “Lo! where the dawn appears: with instant speed “Let each his station to assume proceed. “Fitz-Osbert and myself to Smithfield go: “Thence, when my voice shall have proclaim'd my creed, “Our bands shall rush, and England's pow'rs shall know, “How deeply sinks the shaft when we direct the blow.” XXXIX As thus the Dæmon spoke her high behest, Their Baldock's eloquence the crew admir'd, With conscious awe and strange respect impress'd. As with the firmness which her plans requir'd, And with augmented zeal their souls she fir'd, Each to his post with hasten'd footsteps went. Her views to further thus while all conspir'd, Th' exulting Fiend, on projects vast intent, Resum'd her form, and wide her pinions huge unbent. XL Instant she rose, and, as aloft she hung, Her voice with potency was heard around. With the dread note the vaulted æther rung, The lordly forests bow'd, the stricken ground Re-echo'd with the soul-appalling sound, And hills and vales confess'd it's baleful force: Amid the battlements her walls which crown'd, London beheld old Thames arrest his course, Shrink from his ample bed, and seek his humble source. XLI As in convulsion dire all nature shook, The trembling citizens, with fear aghast, Leap'd from their couches and their roofs forsook: On ev'ry side with tott'ring steps they pass'd, And wildly round them looks of anguish cast. Astounded and half-petrified they seem'd; And, as still vibrated the pow'rful blast, The final day of doom at hand they deem'd: Some wept, some breath'd a pray'r, and some with horror scream'd. XLII The northern wood resounded with her cry. Straightway th' impatient Fiends with out-stretch'd plume Cut thro' th' umbrageous vault, and soaring high, Their deadly purpose eager to resume, Surmounted far the widely-spreading gloom. They joined their leader, and with heedful care Drank in her words foreboding England's doom: Then, as she will'd, each hasten'd to prepare The means by her devis'd the people to ensnare. XLIII Scarce had the sun illum'd the eastern clouds, And ting'd the meadows sparkling yet with dew, When from each quarter rush'd tumultuous crouds. Tho' in disorder seem'd the noisy crew, A sep'rate leader each detachment drew, And, as they march'd, instill'd his doctrines foul. Their bands more num'rous ev'ry moment grew; They rag'd, as if already Hell's controul Dominion full maintain'd o'er each subjected soul. XLIV Soon with their outcries hoarse Heav'n's concave shook: For, eager now th' increasing mob to guide, Some corresponding shape each Dæmon took. Meantime, their ruler spread disorder wide, And seem'd o'er all their movements to preside. To Smithfield's plain she led her followers loud, Where, 'midst his crew by kindred crimes allied, Fitz-Osbert proudly stood. Full low he bow'd, And waving oft his hand address'd the list'ning croud. XLV “Awhile, my fellow-citizens! attend. “Here the Defender of your Rights I stand, “And, as your Guardian, as the People's Friend, “I hail your num'rous and intrepid band “Prepar'd the wrongs of tyrants to withstand. “Too long beneath Aristocratic sway “Has crouch'd this injur'd and insulted land: “Too long has freedom veil'd her cheering ray, “While you beneath the rod of stern oppression lay. XLVI “Where is the virtue which your fathers grac'd? “Are English worth and English valour flown? “Time was, when tyranny you boldly fac'd, “When resolution manfully was shewn, “And liberty by open force was won. “Now, sad reverse! effeminate and tame, “Tho' gall'd by chains, in silent awe you groan, “Nor feel a spark of that cœlestial flame, “Which fills the gen'rous heart and goads it on to fame. XLVII “Was it for You, ye blind and senseless race! “That Richard warr'd in Palestine's defence? “If so, no doubt your profits ye can trace. “What are they? Ye were suffer'd to dispense “From your hard hands the sum of his expence, “Your own subsistence, and your children's bread, “All that from want your starving babes could fence, “All that from penury could guard your head, “All that on wretchedness some comfort scant might shed. XLVIII “Ye gave all this, and what was your return? “The tyrant's grace magnificently shews! “You and your households his proud regents spurn. “Urge ye your wants? your wishes they oppose, “With contumely treat you and with blows. “Do ye presume to taunt them with your right, “To plead your grievances, to state your woes? “Your modest suit contemptuously they slight, “And with disdain your claim of services requite. XLIX “What more remains your slav'ry to complete? “Comes Richard back with high renown bedeck'd? “Do ye the conq'ring hero proudly greet? “No!—both his fortunes and his fame were wreck'd; “But you, fate's doom still ready to correct, “Are privileg'd his ransom to prepare: “'Tis your's the mass enormous to collect, “From all the savings of your anxious care, “From all ye hop'd your wives and progeny should share. L “Say, does your cottage some small comfort hold, “Some little luxuries from toil which spring? “Haste to the mart? let them with speed be sold: “They summon you their utmost worth to bring, “To pay the Ransom of your glorious King! “Are ye reluctant? See the slave of pow'r “The little all ye boast prepar'd to wring, “And tenfold horrors on your heads to show'r, “That pampered sloth may feed, and England's wealth devour. LI “Oh friends! oh once your country's dearest trust! “Desert not now your own, your children's cause: “To nature's feelings do not prove unjust. “Can priestly superstition make ye pause? “The statesman's craft, the tyranny of laws, “The policy of kings, the noble's pride, “All that stern av'rice from the poor man draws, “The gilded roof, the robe with purple dy'd, “All should to action prompt, to energy decide! LII “I see your souls with kindling zeal inspir'd: “Your sensibility with joy I hail. “Now forward, and by sacred freedom fir'd “With force resistless tyranny assail: “Strike home, and o'er th' oppressor's pow'r prevail! “Let liberty's proud banner be unfurl'd; “Nor let your firm and gen'rous efforts fail, “'Till England's tyrants, from their high seats hurl'd, “Prove your transcendent might, and edify the world!” LIII Thus, with successful effort, thro' the croud The practic'd Demagogue his poisons spread: His bold assertions, his demeanour proud, Work'd on their weak credulity, and led Their passions now arous'd to purpose dread. They echo'd all their daring leader spoke; And, as their wrath the crafty Dæmons fed, Rous'd by their agency loud thunders broke, Madness prevail'd, and rage in ev'ry breast awoke. LIV Soon as she saw the multitude array'd, And fitly, as requir'd her prospects, class'd, Thus with imperious tone the Dæmon said. “Suff'rance and tame submission now are past; “The hour of chastisement is come at last: “The altar trembles, and the blood-stain'd throne, “Mould'ring to dust, before your feet is cast. “The injur'd people now no more shall groan, “But wond'ring Europe soon their energy shall own. LV “Thus it behoves you, citizens! to act: “With fire the churches instantly consume; “Let the imperial treasury be sack'd; “The rich and noble to destruction doom; “Their hoarded wealth, drawn from yourselves, resume; “Their wives and daughters for your pleasure take, “Ransack their charms and revel on their bloom; “Let the proud city's firm foundation shake, “And from his dream of pow'r let despotism awake!” LVI Not otherwise, than when a tempest hoarse Tears thro' the dark recesses of the deep, It's caverns echo to the boist'rous force Which ploughs it's foaming surface; rude and steep Mount it's huge billows, by whose pow'rful sweep The navies which triumphant rode are crush'd, And time-worn rocks no more their stations keep; So, with the hope of spoil and slaughter flush'd, The savage mob as will'd th' imperious Dæmon rush'd. LVII As 'cross the field they bent their desp'rate course, Fitz-Alwyn met them, to whose trusty hand Was delegated London's civil force. When rose the tumult, he conven'd his band, And now approach'd, determin'd to withstand The bold conspirators who mock'd his sway. Advancing with an air of high command, He bad them their audacious progress stay, And in more peaceful guise their grievances display. LVIII “Is this a time to breed insensate broil,” Firmly he cried, “when your lov'd King's release “Spreads gen'ral exultation o'er our isle, “When thro' the realm rebellion's horrors cease, “And suff'ring England hails returning peace? “Ere retribution on your crimes await, “This uproar foul and pestilent appease. “Shame on your leaders, whose pernicious hate “Impels you thus to dare the vengeance of the state! LIX “Would they your understandings weak persuade, “That, by exactions from the poor and low, “The ransom of your monarch must be paid? “Their evil purpose such assertions shew, “And prove their base intent: for, People! know “Untouch'd your humble cottages shall stand, “While from the coffers of the rich shall flow “A golden stream, sufficient to command “The freedom of your King from Henry's griping hand. LX “Ere yet stern justice rear her pow'rful scourge, “Declare why thus disorderly ye chuse “The purpose which assembles ye to urge. “What new-discover'd wrong, what fresh abuse, “Can this contempt of government excuse? “If need there be some burthen to remove, “Think ye that Richard will your suit refuse, “He, who ne'er ceas'd his fost'ring care to prove, “His best prerogative a gen'rous people's love? LXI “From him expect protection and redress. “By conquest grac'd, and dignified by fame, “He comes our long-suspended hopes to bless: “This morn his welcome messengers proclaim “That Dover's high cliffs echo with his name, “And that ere noon our Sov'reign we shall greet. “Meantime, whate'er your wishes or your aim, “Homeward let every citizen retreat, “'Till the glad trumpet's voice invite your King to meet.” LXII Hush'd was the multitude: no more their cry Gave token of th' enthusiastic rage, Which prompted them allegiance to defy: Their Prætor's firm address, his councils sage, His ripen'd wisdom, and his rev'rend age, To check their enterprising zeal conspir'd. Ill did Fitz-Osbert of their aid presage, When, as no more their bosoms vengeance fir'd, Each on the other gaz'd and from the front retir'd. LXIII High beat with anger and disdain his breast; He rush'd amid the foremost of his band, Whom with impressive voice he thus address'd. “Why thus, when honour calls, inactive stand? “Why thus, when groans our subjugated land, “Attend ye to a crafty dotard's tale? “Shall we, when he commands, our force disband, “When vengeance calls us, and when fortune's gale “Propels our bark and fills propitiously our sail? LXIV “What tho' of royal clemency he speak? “We want it not, nor are we brought so low, “As pardon by submission base to seek. “Be our's the task our native rights to shew! “When torn the golden circlet from his brow, “When rifled his Aristocratic throng, “Richard may learn a people's pow'r to know. “To triumphs then advance! in union strong, “On your oppressors' heads avenge your country's wrong!” LXV As when a goldsmith holds his even scale, With such precision is the balance fram'd, A breath to discompose it can prevail; So when Fitz-Osbert loudly thus proclaim'd His fell intent, and at their passions aim'd, The populace before his influence bow'd. Again he led them on with rage inflam'd, Again, 'mid cries and imprecations loud, The Fiend's presiding voice to fury urg'd the croud. LXVI Arm'd with their staves or faulchions, as it chanc'd, The felon crew, with fury unrestrain'd, Against Fitz-Alwyn and his host advanc'd, Who worthily their fierce attack sustain'd, And, tho' unequal, well the strife maintain'd. Now o'er the plain the Fiends with outspread wing Hover'd, and wide the civic tumult reign'd, When, suddenly, the air was heard to ring, With loud and frequent shouts of “GOD preserve the King!” LXVII Nearer and nearer drew th' enliv'ning sound, Which thro' Fitz-Alwyn's band new vigour spread, And seem'd his rude assailants to astound. But apprehension soon was turn'd to dread, When, in array and marshall'd order led, A puissant troop of warriors they beheld, With England's far-fam'd Monarch at their head. As o'er the plain their progress they impell'd, Mix'd with the trumpet's note the voice of gladness swell'd. LXVIII As to the scene of action they came near, Trembling and pale was seen the trait'rous band, Conscious of guilt, and struck with sudden fear. Richard, with looks of dignified command Advancing tow'rds them, with an outstretch'd hand Silence bespoke, and thus the croud address'd. “When once again I hail my much-lov'd land, “Is thus my people's loyalty confess'd, “Is it by foul revolt my welcome is express'd? LXIX “On England's wish'd-for and regretted soil, “Scenes diff'rent far from this I look'd to meet. “Can our long-fam'd and highly favour'd isle, “Where Freedom grac'd by Law has fix'd her seat, “Where Arts and Commerce blooming Science greet, “Sons so unworthy of herself produce? “Can she, where Virtue finds her last retreat, “Own as her offspring those, whose mad abuse “Disgrace her choicest gifts by riot and misuse? LXX “What are the ills of which ye thus complain, “Which thus ye seek by tumult to correct? “Does not on ev'ry hand the foaming main “'Gainst foreign insolence your coasts protect? “Do not your harbours Europe's wealth collect? “When war and ravage many a clime deplores, “Does not their rage your happier plains respect, “Where all her rich and variegated stores, “With bountiful excess, benignant Nature pours? LXXI “If these no proofs of fond attachment claim, “Think on the priv'lege which your Laws insure, “Which stamps with dignity the English name. “No chains the freeman bind, no walls immure: “His humble roof from insult is secure; “There may he live, remote from care and fear, “Enjoy his tranquil home and pleasures pure, “There, independent, children's children rear, “To sooth his age, and life's concluding passage cheer. LXXII “These blessings, from the cottage to the throne, “Are your's; these boons to all alike belong: “None but the Guilty the reverse can moan. “Here no oppressor, in injustice strong, “Can crush the weak, the innocent can wrong: “Impartial justice holds her equal scale; “The rich man's wealth, the pleader's clam'rous tongue, “Attempt in vain her judgment to assail; “Unbiass'd she decrees, and law and truth prevail. LXXIII “Nor, 'mid the happiness which fate bestows, “Forget t' enumerate your Sov'reign's love; “On his fond care with confidence repose. “With your's heav'n's will his fortunes interwove, “Doom'd him with you one common lot to prove, “To share alike your triumphs and distress. “Then say what evils your impatience move: “If ills there be, expect from him redress, “Whose best ambition is his countrymen to bless.” LXXIV He said. As when upon the arid plain Exhausted by the sun's meridian pow'r, Descends a gentle and refreshing rain, New fragrance breathes from ev'ry herb and flow'r, Love's carol bursts from each reviving bow'r, And nature, in her freshest robe array'd, Owns the sweet influence of the genial show'r; So Richard's voice the conscious people sway'd, So their approving souls the force of truth obey'd. LXXV Not so th' indignant Fiends. Abash'd awhile, And aw'd to silence, sullenly they stood, As if constrain'd to quit their baffled toil: But soon, intent on anarchy and blood, With march imperious and demeanour rude The Dæmon cloath'd in Baldock's form advanc'd. Her closely follow'd the infernal brood: And, while their arts the wond'ring croud entranc'd, She cried, as o'er their ranks her scornful eye she glanc'd: LXXVI “For Tyranny when thus a Tyrant pleads, “Can ye with patience hear his vain discourse, “While by his hand your injur'd country bleeds, “And looks to you as to her sole resource? “Where are your feelings? Where is nature's force? “Where those exertions which her insults claim? “Trace but your suff'rings to their parent source, “The fatal truth shall dye your cheeks with shame, “Harrow your hearts, and stamp with infamy your name. LXXVII “If yet ye are to learn a People's Right, “Or how your Tyrants lawless pow'r obtain, “Attend, while thus the myst'ry I recite. “While Despots and their councils I arraign, “Learn to regard them with a just disdain, “And Reason as the Test of Truth apply. “So shall dark error and her baleful train “Vanish, as pestilential vapours fly, “When the ascending sun illumes the eastern sky. LXXVIII “Too long has Prejudice the world misled, “Too long, by int'rest and chicane deceiv'd, “Doctrines, from fancy and tradition bred, “Have ye as truths of stamp divine believ'd. “Now, by our New Philosophy repriev'd “From Law's restraint and stern Religion's sway, “Man shall behold his proper Rights retriev'd: “Illumination shall her torch display, “Her influence spread, and strike our tyrants with dismay. LXXIX “Behold by her the veil from error torn! “She says—By Fate's supreme and just decree, “All ranks of men with Equal rights are born: “Without respect to order or degree, “She bids ye Man, as nature made him, see: “If Independence o'er your souls preside, “Ye need but will it, and ye must be Free! “In all, and each, the faculties reside, “Which Providence ordain'd the bark of state to guide. LXXX “The splendid truths she speaks with rev'rence treat: “Let ev'ry bosom own her sacred flame, “Confess her influence and her law complete. “These Rights, she says, the Sov'reign People claim— “'Tis their's alone their Governors to name; “If they offend to drive them from the helm, “And for themselves a Government to frame. “Gain but these points, and then the subject realm, “As best your purpose suits, new-model or o'erwhelm. LXXXI “From this concise and comprehensive code, “Those, gifted by Philosophy's new light, “Are taught to ascertain the only mode, “By which the Gen'ral Interests can unite, “And Human Government attain it's height. “The Sov'reign People must together meet, “And, in their Personal and Sov'reign Right, “Of modelling their Constitution treat: “Then, by a Compact new, the great design complete. LXXXII “Say, did ye thus your Constitution chuse? “No, my lov'd Citizens! to you it came, “A foul abortion, full of wild abuse, “Founded on Tyranny and Conquest's claim. ‘Such as it is, your own, your country's shame, “Where lurks it? No where is the phantom found! “Then use your high prerogative to frame “A Constitution adequate and sound, “And on the Rights of Man the glorious structure ground. LXXXIII “Where did your Ancestors the priv'lege find “By partial laws your freedom to restrain? “What pow'r had they Posterity to bind? “Philosophy rejects it with disdain, “And gives you back your liberty again. “Behold! her antient empire she resumes: “Let not her awful voice be rais'd in vain! “Inspir'd by her, once more our reason blooms, “Each man a Sov'reign grows, a Lawgiver becomes. LXXXIV “Mark her behest. Each generation, free, “And unconfin'd, must for itself debate, “Must on it's laws and government agree. “She teaches too enlighten'd man to hate “The poor distinctions which have stamp'd him great. “By her Illumination taught to think, “He scorns on ancestorial pride to wait; “He sees the Artificial Noble sink, “And to a dwarf before the Natural Noble shrink. LXXXV “The People's Majesty let Tyrants know: “Yon Despot from his seat usurp'd impel, “And pluck the glitt'ring circlet from his brow. “Him let Philosophy exulting tell, “It is not We who 'gainst the laws rebel, “But 'tis that Laws our inborn vigour cramp! “Let your free souls with kindling ardour swell; “Let no weak feelings your exertions damp; “In characters of blood your new dominion stamp. LXXXVI “Seize on the Church's rich and wide domain, “Whence to luxurious priests the treasures spring, “Which aid them o'er men's consciences to reign. “The Tythes, which from your callous hands they wring, “Resume, or to the gen'ral coffers bring. “New-model and re-organize the realm: “Each his own ruler, ev'ry man a King, “Let individual feelings guide the helm, “Abolish ranks, and all distinctions vain o'erwhelm. LXXXVII “Such is the glorious and transcendent prize, “To which Philosophy her train invites: “This to assert and gain She bids ye rise. “Behold the People's Friend! To urge your rights, “And crown your hopes, his patriot soul delights; “With you to triumph, or with you to bleed, “He mocks at danger, and oppression slights: “With him on Reformation's work proceed, “To full success your steps Philosophy shall lead!” LXXXVIII She said. The Fiends, with exclamations loud, Confirm'd her strange and horrible discourse, And urg'd to instant act th' astonish'd croud. Advancing now with shrieks and outcries hoarse, They led 'gainst Richard their tumultuous force, With rage infernal fill'd each ruthless breast, Reckless of reason, pity or remorse. As onward with accurs'd design they press'd, Them with commanding voice their Monarch thus address'd. LXXXIX “Ere yet, by this declaimer's arts misled, “You rashly stoop to his insidious lure, “And ruin's path beyond redemption tread, “Attend! it well behoves you to be sure, “Where tend his views and arguments impure. “Like Sodom's fruit, with outward beauties grac'd, “They captivate the eye, the soul allure, “While all within the tempting rind encas'd “Is bitter and austere, disgusting to the taste. XC “Am I a Tyrant? let my people say! “No test but their unbiass'd voice I need. “Did I the rights of Despotism display, “Argue for Tyranny, for Slav'ry plead? “Richard's free soul abhors the monstrous deed! “I bad you to your Present Bliss attend, “Your actual Rights and Liberties to heed, “On that pure Constitution to depend, “Where laws distinct and known each Englishman defend. XCI “Does the bold pleader call on you to say “Where lurks this Constitution? where 'tis found? “Tell him, that brighter than the orb of day, “O'er England's face it's splendour beams around. “Not more your isle, 'midst ocean's waves profound, “It's station holds, than stands it's base secure: “Of Law, Religion, Truth, the wise compound, “From your forefathers flows it's current pure, “For countless ages fram'd your blessings to assure. XCII “Tell him, it's bond deduc'd from Heav'n's high law “By just gradations ev'ry rank connects: “Tell him, that, blending clemency and awe, “It equally th' oppressor's crime corrects, “Defends the weak, the innocent protects; “That, while it guards the Monarch on his Throne, “The Rights of all his People it respects; “That still, more lovely as the more 'tis known, “You feel it's excellence, and hail it as your own. XCIII “Now settle what regard his sophisms claim. “He bids you Reason as your Test employ “In search of Truth: I bid you do the same. “Say, does not England Liberty enjoy? “Who, when the proud invade, the rich annoy, “Does not in Law a sure protection greet? “Who shall presume your comforts to destroy, “When, watchful pow'r oppressive to defeat, “Complete and full redress impartial Juries mete? XCIV “Wherein consists the Dignity of Man, “Which thus he urges with emphatic tone? “What is it, but his real state to scan, “To guard those blessings nature makes his own, “T' obey those laws whose excellence is known, “Religion's sacred duty to fulfil, “To love his neighbour, to do wrong to none, “To rule his passions, to subdue his will, “And in creation's scale his station due to fill? XCV “In what consist those New, those Equal, Rights, “To which the Demagogue, with boastful scorn, “My free and envied Englishmen invites? “Is it that men with Equal Pow'rs are born? “That none Superior Faculties adorn? “Do not to all far diff'rent gifts belong? “While some their limited endowments mourn, “Others, with minds and corp'ral functions strong, “To high distinction rise, and soar above the throng. XCVI “Or would he in exact proportions class “Our island's substance, so that each might take “His due allotment from the gen'ral mass? “Let us a moment his arrangement make: “The unsubstantial bubble soon will break. “Can his high pleasure Nature's course restrain? “Would not each Birth the baseless fabric shake? “How could each Child it's just proportion gain, “How, when no more remain'd, his Equal Right obtain? XCVII “Does he Varieties of Rank accuse? “Would he, that what all equally admire “All should for ever equally refuse? “First let him quench that spark of heav'nly fire, “Which prompts us high distinction to desire, “Which by progressive steps to virtue leads, “And all that worth and patriotism inspire; “Which urges on the soul to loftier deeds, “For which the statesman toils, for which the warrior bleeds! XCVIII “False is the doctrine, the conclusion vain, “That would mankind of Heav'n's best gift deprive, “And all their nobler energies restrain. “Destin'd for high pre-eminence to strive, “Let them renown from virtuous toils derive, “And by desert adorn their humble name. “Then may a man be truly said to live, “When his approving countrymen proclaim “His honour well atchiev'd, his all-surpassing fame. XCIX “Nor will the proposition prove more true, “That with the People Sov'reignty resides. “How shall ye curb, amid these Monarchs new, “The talent which inferior judgments guides? “Int'rest in all societies divides “The gen'ral will, dominion all would gain, “And oft in russet frock ambition hides: “Make them All Kings, what magic can restrain “Their views discordant, or their sep'rate pow'r maintain? C “How shall these Sov'reigns their behest declare? “Where, when, and how, from ev'ry part remote “Shall they their functions to perform repair, “And on the public weal assembled vote? “Shall a Majority their will denote? “Involuntary homage forc'd to pay, “Thousands of Sov'reigns then their Rights may quote, “While, driv'n their neighb'ring monarchs to obey, “They crouch before their rule, and shrink beneath their sway. CI “No, says the crafty demagogue, the will “Of each his own concerns must regulate. “Mark now, how this his object will fulfil. “Each individual represents the state: “No public councils then, no more debate, “But all what suits their sep'rate purpose chuse; “None on their neighbour's dispensation wait, “All may agree, may cavil or refuse, “And ruin wide shall spread, and riot and abuse. CII “Again his ground he changes, and assumes “The Sov'reign People Rulers may elect. “If so, what of their Sov'reignty becomes? “But how shall I this Proteus strange detect, “When next he says, To cure the state's defect, “The People may, by one supreme compact, “New model it, and all it's faults correct? “If they indeed such mock'ry can transact, “Who, if his doctrine holds, shall ratify their act? CIII “No laws, he said, Posterity can bind, “Or those who have not by their votes concurr'd; “That, as by nature all are unconfin'd, “Each generation must in turn be heard, “And each successive sanction be preferr'd. “If so, his grand compact, his suffrage full, “Compels him to the consequence absurd, “That this Supreme, Unalterable rule, “Each new-born babe may change, may frustrate, or annul. CIV “Such is the Code, sophistical and new, “By which he hopes your passions to awake. “Now mark his purpose, and discern his view. “He looks my gen'rous Englishmen to make “His engines England's commonwealth to shake, “To lead you on thro' unheard crimes he tries, “To spurn religion, and your laws to break, “That he, Fitz-Osbert, and their crew may rise, “And, by their country's fall, attain their wish'd-for prize. CV “And, if they could their parent state destroy, “Have you reflected how their new-found sway “These arbitrary despots would employ? “Like vultures swooping on their helpless prey, “Their bloody tyranny they would display, “Your wealth with greedy av'rice would devour, “Laugh at your groans, and mock at your dismay. “None so exult calamity to show'r, “As those who rise by crimes to unexpected pow'r. CVI “Then think in time, and scorn their base pretence. “Exert those feelings you so oft have shewn, “That steady loyalty, that sterling sense, “By which the English character is known. “Believe and make your Country's cause your own: “Shew to these demagogues in treason bold, “You love your Laws, your Altars, and your Throne; “That, firm and loyal, you will ne'er behold “Your country to her foes by home-bred traitors sold.” CVII Thus spoke the gallant King. In ev'ry breast, Deep sank his sage and eloquent discourse: Enlighten'd by the truth, the croud confess'd It's potent influence and resistless force. Far otherwise the Fiends: with wild concourse Tumultuously they rush'd, and, as they rais'd Their sanguinary shout and outcry hoarse, Harsh thunders roll'd around, blue light'nings blaz'd, And shook the earth, as if by dire portents amaz'd. CVIII Each moment grew more fertile in alarms, And, 'mid the crash of elements, arose The shrieks of Dæmons summoning to arms, When Richard loud exclaim'd: “No mortal foes “Can thus the course of nature discompose: “With more than human instruments they deal. “To Him, who Hell's foul purpose can disclose, “Let us, my friends! with confidence appeal, “Let us implore our GOD their presence to reveal. CIX “Oh Thou! before whose all-transcendent name “Th' infernal pow'rs in mute obedience bend, “Protect us, and defeat their trait'rous aim! “To England and to England's King attend! “Them may thy gracious providence defend “From pois'nous doctrines which corrupt the soul. “While thus our pray'rs to thy high throne ascend, “Oh! may thy pow'r their hateful arts controul, “And strip the thin disguise which shrouds their semblance foul.” CX Thus with uplifted hands the Monarch spoke. In trembling expectation stood the croud, When, sudden, on the right new thunders broke, Rolling along with intonation loud; Heav'n's wide concave with fiercer light'nings glow'd, With angry blast th' increasing tempest swell'd, Enveloping th' horizon in a cloud, Like that, which, ere by Fiat high dispell'd, O'er Chaos and the Deep uncouth dominion held. CXI The anxious multitude, with wild affright, Beheld the face of nature thus revers'd, When, thro' the mantle of surrounding night, Flames fetid and to sense obnoxious burst, And shrieks appalling, as of souls accurs'd, In chorus dread and horrible arose; Loud as the trumpet, which th' Apostle erst Heard, when the Seraph prophesied of woes, With blast which pierc'd the heart and life's warm current froze. CXII But soon more fearful prodigies were seen. Compell'd their forms tremendous to resume, From ev'ry quarter rose the Fiends obscene: Each, as he mounted, wav'd his sable plume, And with resounding stroke cut thro' the gloom. Hov'ring they gaz'd around, while o'er the rest Seem'd False Philosophy her state t' assume, While all, save Belial, her their Chief confess'd. Sternly she gaz'd, and thus the pious King address'd. CXIII “Curs'd be the influence, which our host compels “Thus to forego our half-accomplish'd aim, “Which blasts our projects and thy triumph swells. “Richard! 'tis thine to prosper by our shame, “By hell's defeat to dignify thy name, “And, by this high atchievement, to adorn “Th' immortal wreath reserv'd for thee by fame: “While we, our purpose lost, our honour shorn, “Prepare far hence to meet our potent Monarch's scorn. CXIV “Exult! for more thy virtue now has done, “Than all the toils thy constancy sustain'd, “Than all the glories which thy valour won, “And all the conquests which thy armies gain'd. “With False Philosophy to have maintain'd “Successful warfare, to have stemm'd the tide “Of principles, from Hell's recesses drain'd “To crush the world and spread confusion wide, “May well thy transport raise and justify thy pride. CXV “Exult! meanwhile to other climes I go, “There, in sequester'd solitude, t' await “A time more fit my pow'rful arts to shew. “For come there will a time, prescrib'd by fate, “When False Philosophy may urge her hate, “And reign triumphant o'er debas'd mankind: “When proud dominion o'er the good and great, “When human actions, and the human mind, “With sway unlimited to her shall be consign'd. CXVI “Then, arm'd with terror and distain'd with blood, “My vengeful hand shall rule degen'rate Gaul, “And spread my far-exterminating flood. “Then, when my spells the shrinking soul appal, “Myriads of rebels shall obey my call, “Wide shall my fatal standard be unfurl'd: “Whate'er religion sacred held shall fall, “From regal state her monarch shall be hurl'd, “And philosophic mobs shall rule the bleeding world. CXVII “Then, when amid the universal wreck “Of thrones, of altars, principles and laws, “A faithless nation follows at my beck; “Then, when victorious Hell distends her jaws, “And sends forth hosts to aid our ruthless cause, “Let England tremble! Some shall then be found, “Who here shall greet my doctrines with applause, “Whose felon-daggers shall their country wound, “Whose hands my baleful tree shall plant on English ground. CXVIII “Then shall new Baldocks, new Fitz-Osberts, rise, “Pervert the weak, with crouds tumultuous join, “And, their fell purpose scorning to disguise, “Associations of rebellion sign, “And openly with England's foes combine. “Then horror far shall spread and wild dismay, “While well matur'd shall flourish my design, “While the mad people law shall disobey, “Contemn the voice of GOD, and mock their Sov'reign's sway. CXIX “These and worse ills await thy menac'd realm, “Unless, what fate will scarce to hope allow, “Some honest Statesman then shall guide the helm; “Who, while his breast with youthful zeal shall glow, “Shall tear the mask from frenzied faction's brow, “Shall boldly meet the philosophic herd, “Shall, with an eloquence unrivall'd, shew “How weak their plea, their tenets how absurd, “And call on Albion's sons the patriot sword to gird. CXX “Then, should indeed this prodigy appear, “In vain would False Philosophy disclose “Her bloody presence, or her banner rear: “Europe, exhausted by convulsive throes, “Redeem'd by him' from slaughter would repose; “While envied England, blest with pow'r and fame, “Would rise superior to confed'rate foes, “Peace and good-will tow'rds all mankind proclaim, “And high in glory's fane record her guardian's name!” CXXI Thus with prophetic rage the Dæmon said: But now th' attendant Fiends impatient grew; As widely their ill-omen'd wings they spread, Round her with screams and blasphemies they flew, And, urging her her travel to pursue, Drown'd with their hoarse acclaim her potent cry. Thro' the black vapour soar'd th' infernal crew, While, wrapt in mute suspense, with uprais'd-eye Richard beheld them mount and cut the troubled sky. CXXII With them the storms which mark'd their progress pass'd: Yet still the multitude, with dread impress'd, Gaz'd on the vacant air with looks aghast, When thus the King their awe-struck ranks address'd. “While, as contrition harrows ev'ry breast, “Each self-convicted and upbraiding soul “Shudders at what yon vengeful Fiend confess'd, “Unite to thank the Pow'r, whose strong controul “Prevail'd their plans to foil, to crush their treasons foul. CXXIII “To all a full forgiveness I proclaim, “Save to the wretch, whose heart to virtue dead, “Who, deaf alike to duty and to fame, “Presum'd this rash conspiracy to head, “Whose statements, void of truth, my people led “To court destruction and their King t' o'er-awe. “His death shall cure the ills his vices bred. “Now hence.—From errors past instruction draw: “Fear GOD, obey your King, and venerate the Law!” END OF BOOK XII. BOOK XIII. ARGUMENT. Richard, at a royal banquet, vows to relieve Normandy, and to avenge his wrongs on the French King—The Abbot of Glastonbury presents him with King Arthur's sword Excalibor—Return of the Dæmons to Hell—Their reception —Satan declares his intention to undertake the prosecution of the plans formed against Richard—He sets out on his expedition, accompanied by Belial—They arrive in Normandy—Description of the French and English forces before Rouen. I Soon as the threat'ning tumult was appeas'd Which from the ceaseless hate of Dæmons sprung, The guards Fitz-Osbert, pale and trembling, seiz'd, And to the Elms conveyed him. Much his tongue Implor'd for mercy; round their knees he clung, And sued for life and for his Monarch's grace. Him on a branch, which topp'd the rest, they hung, Midway 'twixt Heav'n and earth: a fitting place, For those who both alike by treasons foul debase. II Meantime, surrounded by the croud, who shar'd His pardon, and their royal master bless'd, The gallant King to Westminster repair'd. Again his lovely Consort to his breast With undissembled ecstasy he press'd; Again his Mother he transported hail'd, Whose firmness, most in danger's hour confess'd, When Fiends and Men her weaken'd power assail'd, Preserv'd the tott'ring realm and gloriously prevail'd. III But soon to scenes of nobler aim his heart, Inflam'd by Philip's broken faith, aspir'd: Renown and great revenge now claim'd their part; England's exhausted state his aid requir'd; Normannia's bleeding province, where untir'd With desolation Gallia's Sov'reign reign'd, His patriotic soul with vengeance fir'd: Remembrance deep his working mind retain'd. Of vows no more observ'd, of compacts now disdain'd. IV The herald's voice was heard the Peers to call, A full and solemn festival to hold, With more than 'custom'd state, in Rufus' hall. Thither repair'd the Knights and Barons bold; Their well-plum'd casques, their surcoats rich with gold, Their gorgeous mails, magnificently shew'd: While from the roof, triumphantly unroll'd, Full many a Saracenic standard flow'd, And heaps of Pagan spoils with gems resplendent glow'd. V High at the end, in seemly state was plac'd, Fronting the northern gate, the royal throne, Again by England's rightful Monarch grac'd. On either hand a princely group was shewn: Beauty might there herself reflected own; There loveliness personified was seen, And breathing sweetness youth and nature shone; All whose perfections could adorn the scene, From charms just beaming love to England's peerless Queen. VI There valour too it's due precedence found: The brave assertors of religion there, Array'd in gay habiliments, around The ample range forgot their former care, And, intermingling with th' assemblage fair, The pow'r of female excellence confess'd. Each Chief was seen his lady's colours wear, And, as with modest warmth his suit he press'd, A sweet responsive glance his honest ardour bless'd. VII The high roof echo'd with the trumpet's note, O'er it's wide arch the sounds of gladness pour'd, And joy on Zephyr's pinions seem'd to float: In rich profusion, the capacious board With all which appetite could tempt was stor'd, With all which art or fancy could combine, And all which bounteous nature could afford, With goblets huge of hypocras and wine, Pure as the nectar'd juice which greets Jove's guests divine. VIII The seventh service now the hall had grac'd, When, suddenly advancing from the gate, Bethune, in herald's tabard rich encas'd, Approach'd to where the martial Monarch sat. High on his head, upon a spacious plate, A Peacock gay he bore, adorn'd with gold And jewels, emblem of chivalric state, Which seem'd with conscious pride his place to hold, Rejoic'd his train with eyes thick-spangled to unfold. IX Him close attended an illustrious band Of knightly bearing, whose resolv'd aspect Bespoke their passing worth: on either hand March'd a fair Dame, in royal splendour deck'd, Whose modest grace the boldest might correct: The lovely Berengaria one, by whom Pembroke advanc'd, his Sov'reign to protect; While, gazing on fair Chariclæa's bloom, Blondel appear'd his claim of duty to resume. X Their progress thro' the crouded hall they made, 'Till near the throne where Richard sat they came, When thus Bethune with low obeisance said: “Oh King renown'd! attend, while in the name “Of Heaven supreme, and of each princely dame “Who here assists, I offer to thy hand, “This Bird mysterious. As of right they claim “Full retribution for this injur'd land: “Vengeance for treasons foul and perjuries they demand. XI “Think, mighty Monarch! of Normannia's grief: “See, where oppress'd by Philip's power she bleeds; “To thee she looks for succour and relief, “To thee, the Champion of the Cross, she pleads. “See, where the foe his bands ferocious leads, “Where bold injustice innocence o'er-awes, “Where proud oppression on her vitals feeds: “Arouse thee, Richard! vindicate her cause, “Call forth thy puissant might, and win the world's applause!” XII He said. Loud murmurs rose on every side, And cries expressive of their strong disdain. The martial King, slow rising, thus replied. “When beauty pleads redress of wrongs to gain, “Her pow'rful claims can ne'er be urg'd in vain. “My conscious heart confirms the dire detail “Of treasons which the Gallic Monarch stain, “And joyfully the fav'ring hour I hail, “When o'er the perjur'd foe our valour may prevail. XIII “As when, commission'd by superior pow'r, “O'er Afric's plains consuming locusts sweep, “Her choicest fruits they unrestrain'd devour, “'Till, rousing from their temporary sleep, “The winds of Heav'n o'erwhelm them in the deep; “So shall the terrors of our arms be shewn: “No more her mis'ries shall Normannia weep, “But Philip, trembling on his blood-stain'd throne, “Shall rue his broken faith, and England's vengeance own. XIV “So may my earnest hopes completion know, “As here, before each knight and peerless dame, “On this Mysterious Bird I truly vow, “And faithfully my purpose firm proclaim. “By His eternal and transcendent name, “Whose pow'rful will the universe directs; “By Her, to whom th' angelic mission came; “By every Saint, who England's weal protects; “By all that Holy Church confesses and respects: XV “By all the charms of this assemblage fair, “Whose pleadings vengeance in my breast awake, “And by the virtues of this Bird, I swear “On perjur'd Philip great revenge to take. “For them, and for my injur'd country's sake, “My arm the faithless monarch shall pursue, “Curb his oppressions, and his proud throne shake, “Nor cease, 'till amply his offence he rue, “And for his crimes atone with retribution due.” XVI As thus the King with warmth impassion'd spoke, The knightly band confirm'd his high behest, And thro' the hall loud shouts of transport broke: A common ardour reign'd in every breast; All, as they forward came, their zeal confess'd, And on the sacred Bird pronounc'd their vows, To aid the cause of Normandy oppress'd. But soon were hush'd their clamours to repose, When royal Elinor with grace majestic rose. XVII “Thanks to high Heav'n!” the Queen exulting cried, “Whose mercies have permitted me to share “In Richard's glories and in England's pride; “To see the fondest object of my care, “Restor'd to dignity and pow'r, prepare “To launce destruction on our country's foe! “Victim no more of anguish and despair, “Of dread suspense and agonizing woe, “O'er my transported heart I feel hope's influence flow. XVIII “Oh Albion! destin'd to command the world! “Rejoice, for Richard re-assumes his pow'r, “And once again his banner is unfurl'd! “Flown is despair, and past the dreary hour, “When on thee adverse fortune seem'd to lour, “And from her unexhausted stores of ill “Calamity and death prevail'd to show'r. “Arouse! obedient to the Eternal's will, “To vindicate His ways, His justice to fulfil. XIX “Now let base Philip tremble with dismay; “For retribution long delay'd is nigh, “And tenfold vengeance shall his wrongs repay. “No more shall England's Lion prostrate lie; “His lordly mane erect, inflam'd his eye, “On Gallia's faithless sons behold him spring: “Like scatter'd sheep before his wrath they fly, “While bright renown waves high her sounding wing, “And in ecstatic notes proclaims our Victor King. XX “Oh may that valour, which Judæa's throne “Against the Saracenic force upheld, “Be now with energy transcendent shewn! “May foul conspiracy and guilt be quell'd! “May Philip, by my hero's arms compell'd, “Crown by submission his recorded shame! “Then may my soul, his triumph full beheld, “To kindred skies ascending, bless his name, “Stampt with his country's praise, and grac'd with well-earn'd fame!” XXI Still on her words th' enraptur'd audience hung, Each kindling soul, in momentary trance, Confess'd the potent influence of her tongue, And hail'd the time, when England's sons might launce Her stores of treasur'd wrath on perjur'd France, When, as wide-op'ning flew the northern gate, A sacerdotal band was seen t' advance, With gesture dignified and seemly state, To where the martial King in regal splendour sat. XXII He, who as chief the grave procession led, In stole and rochet fitly was array'd; He bore a mitre on his hoary head, And in his hand a pond'rous sword display'd. When near approach'd, the troop it's progress stay'd; Each, humbly crossing with his arms his breast, Bent low, and duly his obeisance made; Then, with an air which rev'rence deep express'd, Silent remain'd, while thus their Chief the Prince address'd; XXIII “Illustrious Monarch! whose auspicious reign “In fame's bright annals will for ever bloom, “Permit my speech. From Glaston's holy fane, “To tell what lately there befel, we come. “'Tis known, when Arthur yielded to his doom, “Compell'd fate's ruthless mandate to obey, “That there the earth receiv'd him in her womb: “But, from that period, none presum'd to say, “In what peculiar spot the British Champion lay. XXIV “For o'er his deeds dark Ignorance detail'd “Her web obscure, and his surpassing worth “In legendary tales and mysteries veil'd. “Ere waking science re-illum'd the earth, “In the proud hall, or round the peasant's hearth, “Her story oft Credulity would tell; “How Merlin's charms presided at his birth, “How oft he fought, and how at last he fell, “And how his soul was doom'd t' abide the potent spell. XXV “But his deserts, secur'd on virtue's base, “Some more discerning chroniclers have found “With true record his energies to grace. “Against the Saxon foe in war renown'd “Nine times he bravely fought by victory crown'd; “His patriot blood for Britain's cause he drain'd; “He rous'd her from her lethargy profound, “With hosts barbaric glorious war maintain'd, “And deck'd with clemency the meed his arms had gain'd. XXVI “Him, their illustrious Chief, their darling King, “Our British ancestors with patriot flame, “By their loud harps inspir'd, were wont to sing. “For, as old Greece her Alexander's fame, “As Rome rejoic'd her Cæsar's to proclaim, “As France her Charlemagne, and as our land “Beyond compare exalts her Richard's name, “So Arthur's valour our fore-fathers scann'd, “And told in rapt'rous strains the wonders of his hand. XXVII “Forgive, great Prince! th' effusions of a zeal “For worth departed, which an old man lead “To talk of what all English hearts must feel. “Now briefly to my purpose I proceed. “Some days are past, since, for a brother freed “From mortal vanities, a grave we made. “Taught by a dream, he oft would intercede “In a sequester'd corner to be laid, “Where Joseph's thorn far spread it's venerable shade. XXVIII “With his request we cheerfully complied: “When lo! within the consecrated ground “A stone Sarcophagus our monks descried. “As all assembled circled it around, “In meditation wrapt and silence bound, “We forc'd it to disclose it's secret trust. “A female's bones, with flaxen hair, we found: “But this as one attempted to adjust, “From his rude grasp it shrank, and mould'ring fell to dust. XXIX “Beneath this chest, a second we survey'd, “Whose pond'rous lid with rev'rence meet we rais'd. “In it a warrior's skeleton was laid. “Soon as we mov'd it from it's place, amaz'd “On two rough pyramids of stone we gaz'd, “O'er which barbaric characters were spread, “Of form uncouth, and half by time eras'd; “'Twixt them a coffin, with a cross of lead, “On which engrav'd these words, as yet distinct, we read: XXX “Here, to submit to fate's harsh mandate doom'd, “In rich Avalon's blooming island lies “Arthur, his country's brave support, entomb'd.” “We view'd his honour'd bones in mute surprize: “Huge their proportions, and immense their size; “Like those of Earth's aspiring sons they seem'd, “Who, as old poets feign, besieg'd the skies. “No wonder he, when living, was esteem'd “The Champion, who our isle from foreign foes redeem'd. XXXI “As gazing we contemplated his strength, “In his right hand this massy Sword we view'd: “It's weight surpassing, it's unusual length, “And blade high-temper'd, led us to conclude “This was the fam'd Excalibor, endued “By potent Merlin with endowments high, “And which ere while, in many a combat rude “By Arthur borne, compell'd the foes to fly, “Who in the field had dar'd with Britain's Chief to vie. XXXII “With rev'rence due the King we re-inhum'd: “And now, attended by my humble band, “To greet this presence, Sire! have I presum'd, “Imploring that, when on Normannia's strand “Our valiant Monarch may decree to land, “The base invaders of his rights to face, “This matchless weapon may adorn his hand. “May it prevail the perjur'd Gauls to chase! “May victory and renown our Second Arthur grace!” XXXIII Thus saying, tow'rds the Sov'reign he advanc'd, And at his feet the pond'rous faulchion laid. The gift, which long tradition thus enhanc'd And legends famous made, the King survey'd: It's weight he pois'd, admir'd it's massy blade, And seem'd awhile as if immers'd in thought: Then, rising, to the age-worn Priest he said, “My warmest thanks are due to him who brought, “To aid my cause, this sword which Britain's glory wrought. XXXIV “For him who bore it once inspir'd with awe, “As a propitious omen I receive “This sacred pledge. Fulfill'd be Heav'n's high law, “Which thus Normannia calls me to relieve! “Oh may my arm her inj'ries soon retrieve! “May Arthur's spirit in my bosom flame, “Teach me deeds worthy of himself t' atchieve, “And, as he guides my gallant bands to fame, “May new successes grace his once-lov'd Britain's name!” XXXV Thus spake the King, and wav'd aloft the blade. The Chieftains, who his gen'rous zeal admir'd, With eager glance the sacred sword survey'd, And each, as if with kindred ardour sir'd, To snatch his portion of renown aspir'd. Now dawn'd approaching day. The Monarch rose, And with his nobles from the hall retir'd, All fill'd with hope, all earnest to disclose The worth so oft employ'd against their country's foes. XXXVI Meantime, the Dæmons, frustrated their spell, Wide thro' the gloom their pow'rful wings display'd, And sullenly resum'd their way to Hell. No ray of hope their fell despair allay'd: On they advanc'd, to meet their King afraid, As if already to their awe-struck view He stood in plenitude of wrath array'd. They would have paus'd: but still some influence new Their deprecated course compell'd them to pursue. XXXVII Soaring reluctant thro' the troubled sky, 'Mid the dark regions of void space they pass'd, Which never had explor'd created eye, But from whose range, indefinitely vast, Imagination sick'ning shrank aghast. Now rag'd around them winds with fury dire, Now black'ning waters, now the thunder's blast: 'Mid shoals immense of ice they seem'd t' expire, Or scorch'd in blazing streams of elemental fire. XXXVIII Far different now their feelings, than when erst, Breathing defiance proud against their foes, They left Hell's precincts, and with flight accurs'd Hasten'd the bold crusaders to oppose, And show'r on England's King remorseless woes. Them in full chorus, with reproachful tongue, A band infernal hail'd: at every close Of their foul chant the dark recesses rung, As thus with joy obscene malignantly they sung. XXXIX “Hail to the puissant and victorious host, “Whose execution has no doubt fulfill'd “The confidence excited by their boast! “In policy beyond their compeers skill'd, “They come to reap the harvest they have till'd, “And wear the laurels they so well have won. “Behold! our Prince, with admiration fill'd, “Waits to receive you on his awful throne, “Soon shall your well-earn'd fame and trophies high be shewn.” XL They heard the taunt: with indignation gall'd When as preparing for retort they seem'd, Superior pow'r their faculties enthrall'd. For now they Satan saw: his stern eyes gleam'd, His snake-encircled ringlets wildly stream'd, And high in air he wav'd his flaming spear: The dread assemblage round him hoarsely scream'd As on the band he gaz'd, who, drawing near, Felt his consuming glance, and prostrate fell with fear. XLI Belial alone his potency withstood: His front yet dignified he scorn'd to hide; Fix'd he remain'd, and in indignant mood His Prince offended sullenly he ey'd, Still conscious of desert, still fill'd with pride, And still a lordly fiend, tho' overthrown. At length in accents of command he cried, “Let cowards trembling crouch before thy throne! “To Belial's nobler soul such baseness is unknown! XLII “Against my efforts had not fate conspir'd, “My matchless talents, worthily display'd, “Hell and it's peerless Monarch had admir'd. “Vast were my plans, and sagely were they laid; “I look'd the fortunes of our foe t' have sway'd, “And England's desolation to have wrought: “But unforeseen events my hopes betray'd; “Opposing Heav'n it's aid resistless brought, “And from my vengeful grasp my destin'd victim caught. XLIII “What Belial's energy has done, how well “He stands entitled to infernal fame, “Let those who witness'd his bold efforts tell: “His own exploits he deigns not to proclaim. “But, long as Austria's prostituted name, “Long as the crimes which bloody Henry stain, “And long as Philip's perjuries and shame, “By him effected, on record remain, “These taunting Fiends shall own his puissance was not vain. XLIV “No mean excuse, no subterfuge I seek: “Let those to varnish o'er their failings try, “Whose spirits, like their paltry cause, are weak. “'Twas mine with Heav'n and all it's host to vie: “With soul undaunted and with steadfast eye “I dar'd their legions, as with out-stretch'd wing “And arm'd for war they rang'd across the sky, “Commission'd by supreme decree to bring “Conquest and high renown to Albion's valorous King. XLV “Alone I fac'd them. Then the boastful crew, “Who now condemn me, and whose venom'd tongue “Presumes to mock me, their support withdrew; “While round their favour'd hero Cherubs sung, “Their sounding harps approving Angels strung, “Him and his cause 'mid perils they sustain'd, “And o'er his paths their sov'reign influence flung: “I still, tho' unsupported I remain'd, “Provok'd the strife, and Hell's extremest malice drain'd. XLVI “Nor do I now the bold encounter shun: “Speak but the word, and my impatient soul “Shall rush to end the contest I begun. “I own, dread Monarch! thy supreme controul: “But for those dastard fiends, whose railings foul “Obscenely speak their own, not Belial's shame, “Thus, far as Styx and black Cocytus roll, “Contempt and endless hatred I proclaim! “Now let thy voice pronounce my judgment or my fame.” XLVII He ended. Thus th' infernal King replied. “Imperious Fiend! thy ardour I commend, “And praise the haughtiness and stubborn pride, “Which, whether good or ill thy steps attend, “Forbid thee from thy dignity to bend. “These are my darling attributes, which heal “Remorse and shame, which crimes with virtues blend, “Which teach the soul conviction to conceal, “And the firm heart against upbraiding conscience steel. XLVIII “These master passions of the strenuous mind, “Whether by nature in it's essence bred, “Or nurtur'd by indulgence unconfin'd “Are best adapted for our use, to spread “Our rule destructive and dominion dread. “Prompted by these to ill, presumptuous man “T' oppose th' eternal law of Heav'n is led: “A stranger to himself, he dares to scan “The Great Eternal Cause, and to correct His plan. XLIX “Thee then, whose courage rises from defeat, “With unabated kindness I salute, “And as befits a potent chieftain greet. “Henceforward be thy bold accusers mute: “Distinctions proud their malice shall refute, “And high pre-eminence shall stamp the worth “Of him, whose prowess vainly they dispute, “To whose superior arts we owe the birth “Of half the mortal ills which subjugate the earth. L “For know, intrepid spirit! thou shalt share “Thy Monarch's laurels: 'gainst the foe of hell “Jointly with me thy arm shall vengeance bear. “What tho' inferior pow'rs have fail'd to quell “The heav'n-defended King! our potent spell “May haply blast the freshness of his bays: “Conquest and fame may yet our triumphs swell, “And those, who mock thee now, shall join to raise “To thy confess'd renown, a monument of praise. LI “But those abash'd and coward dæmons, those, “Whose feeble souls, when fortune smiles elate, “Possess no energy her frowns t' oppose, “A harsher sentence and severer fate, “Such as their fault has merited, await. “Far from our presence driv'n, let them conceal “Their blighted honours and diminish'd state: “Let them our scorn and indignation feel! “Away! my firm decree admits not of appeal!” LII The Monarch spoke, and frowning wav'd his hand. Throughout th' assemblage dread arose a cry, And prostrate still was seen the fearful band, When, rous'd from torpor, False Philosophy Disclos'd her form bewitching, and on high Rearing her front, the wrathful King address'd. “I purpose not by abject suit to try “T' avert the terrors of thy stern behest: “Too strongly on my mind it's justice is impress'd. LIII “Ill it becomes us thy decree to scan, “When still unvanquish'd is our hated foe, “And unperform'd remains our splendid plan. “Yet, ere far hence in banishment we go, “This consolation deign at least t' allow: “Here in the face of Hell's tremendous host, “And in thy presence, mighty Prince! to shew “That not unfounded was thy servant's boast, “That not from want of zeal our look'd-for prize was lost. LIV “For well and sagely were our plans conceiv'd, “Our talents, courage, and resources vast “Superior enterprize might have atchiev'd. “But execution our design o'erpass'd. “Ere yet our aptest instruments were class'd, “Ere yet a world debas'd could give them scope, “With ardour, unchastiz'd by sage forecast, “We dar'd with rooted prejudice to cope. “Thus vain our bold attempt, and baseless prov'd our hope. LV “For long it takes to brutalize the mind: “Religion, and the innate sense of right; “Conscience, that monitor to each assign'd; “The various proofs of Heav'n's transcendent might, “It's boundless presence, it's all-piercing sight; “Th' advantages which governments impart; “The blessings which the social bond requite; “These are too deeply planted in the heart, “To yield to common pow'rs or to unpractis'd art. LVI “Yet these too rashly to subvert we tried: “No wonder then we saw our efforts fail. “But, tho' the glorious palm is now denied, “Hereafter may our potent charms prevail: “Then may kind fortune with propitious gale “To certain conquest and unbounded sway “Impel our course, and fill our ample sail; “Then circled round by horror and dismay, “Her 'sanguin'd crest may False Philosophy display! LVII “Our measures should be fitted to the times: “As the soil dictates should our seed be sown. “Mankind as yet are immature in crimes: “Howe'er to sin and disobedience prone, “That still more damning guilt to make them own, “Which spurns at Nature and at Nature's Source, “By zeal and patience can be wrought alone: “Corruption must maintain it's steady course, “And by progression sure attain it's perfect force. LVIII “Might I without presumption sketch a plan, “By which Heav'n's high behest to circumvent, “And fix our empire o'er the soul of man, “Thus would I realize my great intent. “Let your expertest ministers be sent “His heart against compassion's touch to steel; “'Till, callous grown, he ceases to lament “The tortures which his suff'ring victims feel, “When from his hand they shrink, and make their vain appeal. LIX “Let them against parental guidance rail, “And the restraints which social rules impose “On free and independent youth bewail: “Let Sophistry with labour'd comments glose, “And Metaphysics specious doubts disclose, “The arrogant half-reas'ner to ensnare; “Till, for Heav'n's will all rev'rence taught to lose, “To doubt it's providence men boldly dare, “And lead deluded herds their impious toils to share. LX “When thus all physical and moral sense “Shall be perverted into gross abuse, “Let Luxury her subtle charms dispense, “And Pleasure, glancing in a thousand hues, “Her venom in their pamper'd hearts infuse: “Let them their passions temptingly assail “With glowing systems fitted for the stews; “At strict and formal virtue let them rail, “And Sensuality in Grace's semblance veil. LXI “Nor to these first essays alone confine “The potent influence of infernal art. “Of range more ample is my great design. “Preach to the mob, and urge it to the heart, “That all in nature's boons should hold their part: “Of rank and wealth th' unjust allotment prove; “At bolder crimes instruct them not to start; “Teach them by force the barriers to remove, “By which to guard the Crown their wise forefathers strove. LXII “Then, when matur'd my plan and ripe the time, “My bold Apostles may with certain aim “Lead on degraded man from crime to crime. “'Gainst Social Order then shall he declaim, “Brand Laws, and Kings, and Governments with shame, “Involve the world in universal gloom, “And, snatching at a transitory fame, “Spurn at the terrors of a wrath to come, “Of that damnation deep which lasts beyond the tomb.” LXIII “Dæmon!” exclaim'd the King, “thy councils sage “My approbation and concurrence meet. “With Heav'n we thus may glorious warfare wage. “Exert thyself thy project to complete! “Methinks already, prostrate at my feet, “I view deprav'd mankind my will perform, “And Hell's dread Pow'rs th' Eternal's plan defeat: “Methinks, uncheck'd our dire Apostles swarm, “And blasted Europe sinks beneath th' o'erwhelming storm. LXIV “Be thine the matchless enterprise to guide: “The progress of thy delegates inspect, “And o'er them with unbounded sway preside; “The aptest ministers of ill select, “Their tasks apportion and their toils direct; “Let loose the torrent of o'erwhelming woe, “And to unblushing vice the world subject. “Meantime, to Gallia's threaten'd realm I go, “To ward from Philip's head the meditated blow.” LXV Thus his infernal purpose Satan spoke: Enraptur'd the surrounding Dæmons heard, And thus Hell's Chorus fearfully awoke. “Hail to our matchless Prince, whose cheering word “Shall heal defeat by meaner pow'rs incurr'd! “Now shall the chalice of despair o'erflow; “And, while no more our vengeance is deferr'd, “Shame, and despair, and desolating woe, “With tenfold force shall break on our presumptuous foe. LXVI “Disdainful of repose our King behold, “In all his plenitude of wrath array'd! “His potent influence, free and uncontroul'd, “The furthest bounds of nature shall pervade. “Soon shall his sway imperial be display'd: “While England's Champion trembling meets his doom, “While her dominion sinks, her laurels fade, “Unbounded empire Gallia shall assume, “Her Genius undepress'd shall wave his conq'ring plume! LXVII “Fiends! to exalt his praise your voices join, “And, as our Monarch worthily is hail'd, “Triumphant songs of ecstasy combine. “Oft has his hand the works of Heav'n assail'd, “And oft against it's boasted plans prevail'd. “Raise the glad sound, in notes exulting tell, “How Eden's walls the Prince of Darkness scal'd, “How Adam from his first perfection fell, “And how a sinful world was subject made to Hell. LXVIII “Dæmons! record the artifice sublime, “By which the man, by his Creator lov'd, “Was led to perpetrate the foulest crime. “Declare how he, whose wisdom all approv'd, “By Satan tempted, in lust's mazes rov'd “With harlots and their prostituted train: “How in old age, by their enticements mov'd, “He dar'd with impious hand and worship vain “To offer sacrifice in Baal's sumptuous fane. LXIX “These felt his puissance, these confess'd his sway! “Proceed, illustrious Prince! to triumphs new, “And teach mankind thy dictates to obey. “Stretch forth thy strenuous wing, thy toil pursue, “Nor cease 'till Richard his presumption rue. “Proceed! the mighty enterprise complete! “Already our victorious King we view, “With conquest crown'd, resume his awful seat, “While Hell applauding joins his proud return to greet.” LXX “Cease!” cried th' impatient King: “th' eventful time “And Philip's danger other cares demand. “See, where collecting all his nation's prime, “Our daring foe conducts his martial band. “Ploughing the waves, he seeks the Gallic strand: “Now, near approaching the Normannic coast, “Mark how the red-cross banners waving stand; “High mounts the clamour of the war-tried host, “And Heav'n's wide arch resounds with their exulting boast. LXXI “Above him Victory soars array'd in fire, “Points to the shore, and spreads her sounding wing. “Around him hovers an angelic choir: “I hear their strain seraphic, as they sing “The promis'd triumphs of their favour'd King. “See where they reach the strand! 'mid loud acclaim “Behold to earth the gallant Monarch spring, “His visage beaming with cœlestial flame, “And firm his manly step, as if assur'd of fame! LXXII “A man more noble ne'er did I behold: “Alike in council provident and sage, “In feats of arms pre-eminently bold, “Dæmons with him may worthy contest wage, “And fitly in the glorious strife engage. “Belial! no more indulge thy fruitless care: “Ere long his fall thy anguish shall assuage. “For who of human mould can 'scape the snare, “Which pow'r infernal frames, and Satan deigns prepare?” LXXIII As thus the Monarch spoke his purpose dread, The vault infernal shook with clamours hoarse. High in the gloomy air his plumes he spread, And vig'rously, unconscious of remorse, With Belial his associate held his course, 'Till to the spot they came, where widely wav'd The banners of the French and English force, And, on the banks by Seine's broad current lav'd, Rouen's embattled walls her stern besiegers brav'd. LXXIV In antient state and ample range they stood, Their ramparts huge, by lofty turrets crown'd, Skirting the northern barrier of the flood. Close by the stream, on its exalted mound The Citadel in state majestic frown'd, Where Leicester, long to deeds of prowess train'd, Defied the Gallic force, and, circled round By English captains, well his post maintain'd, And, tho' by want oppress'd, the brunt of war sustain'd. LXXV Before it's massy gate a drawbridge hung, Which, when occasion serv'd to gall the foe, O'er the wide moat the gallant Chieftain flung, And, leading cross his bands in martial shew, Taught the proud French his energy to know. These o'er the plain in varied ranks were class'd, Stretch'd from the river to St. James's brow, Which on the north, pre-eminently vast, Rear'd it's enormous bulk, and lesser hills surpass'd. LXXVI There, widely waving in the air, were seen The banners of full many a puissant Knight: Joinville, Des Brennes, De Marby, and Sargines, Des Barres, Sabran, all known in Pagan fight, Their stations held and led their warlike might; Sancerre, Beaujeu, by equal ardour fir'd, With Clermont and Nanteuil, in armour bright, Their martial bands conducted, and aspir'd T' increase their old renown in Palestine acquir'd. LXXVII With these, long-us'd to foreign war, appear'd, In varied armaments, a num'rous host, Who ne'er in Judah had their standards rear'd, But now aloud proclaim'd their vaunting boast. There, from his distant Languedocian coast, Illustrious St. Leger his legions brought; There too his vassals D'Auvilieres dispos'd, Whom brave Blangie the use of arms had taught, And now with him new scenes of promis'd glory sought. LXXVIII From their Provencal mountains Grandmesnil, And Montolieu, with expedition came, Prepar'd their Monarch's dictates to fulfil. Brancas and Fiereville, known alike to fame, Obey'd his call: nor did ambition's flame Less urge Beauplan, or valiant D'Euremode, With Gallia's Chiefs their ardour to proclaim. Far as the eye could stretch their banners flow'd, And ev'ry heart with zeal and expectation glow'd. LXXIX Encircled by the camp a fortress stood, Fontaine Gaalor call'd, where Philip held His court august, and from it's turrets rude Survey'd the city which his force repell'd. Inflam'd by vengeful rage and hate unquell'd, As o'er her range he cast his eager eye, His lab'ring breast with double fury swell'd; He urg'd his troops their vig'rous toils to ply, And crush the foe who dar'd his boasted pow'r defy. LXXX But nor his puissance, nor his war-tried band, O'er Leicester's skill and vigilance prevail'd: Like a true English Oak he made his stand, And, tho' by angry winds and storms assail'd, His stedfast truth and energy ne'er fail'd. Still firm and vig'rous he maintain'd his course, Still all the terrors of his name detail'd, Prompting the efforts of his gallant force, At once their friend, their chief, their model, their resource. LXXXI Inspir'd by him and by their country's love, The toils of war undauntedly they shar'd: Rejoic'd their antient loyalty to prove, The boastful foe with common toil they dar'd, Nor, 'mid their suff'rings, of relief despair'd. Approving Heav'n their constancy beheld, And, sanctioning their ardour, aid prepar'd; For now, with sails by fav'ring breezes swell'd, Tow'rds them a royal fleet it's succ'ring course impell'd. LXXXII High in the wind their blood-red streamers flow'd, Their tall prows boldly cut the foaming tide, Their decks with warriors close assembled glow'd, As, with becoming pomp and seemly pride, The lordly vessels Gallia's coasts defied. From Rouen's walls a shout of transport rose, When her brave champions England's flag descried, Majestically waving to disclose Security for them, and vengeance on their foes. LXXXIII As when, o'erpast inclement winter's reign, Hush'd are his storms, and, borne on Zephyr's wing, With gay delight and pleasure in her train, Breathing new joys returns the genial spring, Her warbling choristers their carols sing, And nature hails her domination sweet: So, when to earth leap'd Albion's potent King, Leicester's brave band rush'd forth their Prince to meet, And join'd with loud acclaim his glad approach to greet. LXXXIV Like Mars new-lighting on his Thracian height, Breathing defiance proud, the Monarch seem'd: His casque with plumes bedeck'd, his armour bright, Superbly glancing in the sun's rays gleam'd. Whate'er of worth heroic bards have dream'd, All that the sculptor's fancy can embrace, Concenter'd in his manly presence beam'd. Vain would have prov'd their vaunted pow'rs to trace His soul-expressive eye, his more than mortal grace. LXXXV And fit companions for their King appear'd The warriors who compos'd his num'rous train: Their rich-emblazon'd banners high they rear'd, As, spreading widely o'er the fertile plain Extending to the southward from the Seine, They rang'd their camp, which from St. Catherine's height, That on the west stretch'd far it's lordly reign, To Rollo's castle reach'd: nor mortal sight Their line could trace, nor tongue their numbers count aright. LXXXVI There, first in station as in fame, once more The gen'rous Champions of the Cross were seen, Who erst with Richard fought on Jaffa's shore: Brave Mortimer wav'd high his faulchion keen; Mauleon, still in danger's front serene, And bold Lestang prepar'd their arms to wield: There Lacy bad his vet'ran troops convene; Intrepid Neville boldly grac'd the field, And Reginald display'd his oft-distinguish'd shield. LXXXVII Harcourt, St. Waleric, Audley and Bohun, Led forth their squadrons: in triumphant shew The standards of Dubois, Gournay, Verdun And gallant Somerville were seen to flow: There Pembroke, Moubray, Granville and Des Preaux, De Courcy, Bayntun and St. Paul were found, Castellun, terror of the Pagan foe, Illustrious Tancarville, in war renown'd, And Vernon, still infirm from many a recent wound. LXXXVIII There too Blondel in martial state advanc'd: Eager his new-emblazon'd shield to prove, His eye o'er Gallia's far-rang'd host he glanc'd. The scarf he wore which England's Regent wove; Yet still his thoughts tow'rds younger charms would rove, For Chariclæa's pow'r his heart confess'd: In vain against her 'witching sway he strove; Deep in his mind her image was impress'd, And, as he gaz'd, now hope, now fear consum'd his breast. LXXXIX To the fair empress of his soul attach'd, He led her smiling from the sea-girt strand: With eager care her ev'ry look he watch'd, And oft, her charms unable to withstand, Would press with gentle touch her yielding hand: While she, soft blushes mantling o'er her cheek, As if unconscious of his mute demand, Of matters foreign to his wish would speak, And with benignant grace to check his ardour seek. XC As erst on Japhia's heights a spear she grasp'd; Her swelling bosom and her tap'ring waist A cuirass rich with burnish'd gold enclasp'd: A splendid casque, with snow-white plumage grac'd, And bright with gems, upon her head was plac'd. Not lovelier look'd, on gay Cythera's plain, The laughing Queen in Mars's arms encas'd, When sportive Cupids form'd her joyous train, And Graces danc'd around, and Pleasure held his reign. XCI Fair Berengaria too brav'd war's alarms, Beauteous like her, yet, as the full-blown rose From the bud differs, her maturer charms Appear'd complete perfection to disclose. She sought the Park, where, sacred to repose, And shrouded by it's stately forest's shade, The Castle of Normannia's Dukes arose, Still in uncouth magnificence array'd, While o'er it's turrets huge the spreading ivy play'd. XCII Thither with Cyprus' royal maid she went. But England's Monarch other thoughts engross'd: To Rouen's walls his anxious steps he bent, There to consult of what behov'd him most, And commune with the leaders of his host. The vet'ran warriors hail'd him as he came: Their doubts were now in glory's visions lost, And hope re-kindled her inspiring flame, Since their lov'd King appear'd to lead them on to fame. END OF BOOK XIII. BOOK XIV. ARGUMENT. A dispute arising between Philip and John while they are surveying the English host, Satan orders Belial to appease it—He suggests to them a plan for surprizing the English Camp, and carrying off the Queen—They prepare to execute it, while Satan convenes the Dæmons and raises a storm— Surprize of the English Camp—Night combat—Berengaria is rescued by Richard—Chariclæa is carried off by John to the fortress of Fecan—Blondel undertakes to deliver her. I On rude Gaalor's lofty summit stood The Gallic King; with oft recurring glance Tracing the course of Seine's wide-spreading flood, He mark'd the English armaments advance, As in succession many a helm and lance Blaz'd with the setting sun: he heard a cry, Denouncing vengeance on insulting France, Burst thro' each crouded squadron; mounting high The chorus swell'd and loud re-echo'd to the sky. II Like the precursor of his doom it rose, Big with his own and with his country's fate, With horror and accumulating woes. Still, as it breath'd destruction on his state, His lab'ring fancy visions would create, Fantastic spectres, which the blast bestrode, Or in their cloudy chariots grimly sat, And seem'd approaching ruin to forebode. His sick'ning heart recoil'd as thro' the air they rode. III On him attendant, and alike unbless'd, Stood John, the partner of his guilt and shame, Whom thus with hurried accents he address'd. “Heard you yon shouts, whose piercing sounds proclaim “Death to our hopes, and ruin to our fame? “Saw you, swift-gliding thro' the troubled air, “Yon forms portentous rob'd in lurid flame, “Hast'ning, like Heav'n's dread couriers to prepare “Triumphs for England's King, for us increas'd despair? IV “Be these pictures of a mind diseas'd, “By morbid fancy and distemper wrought, “Or tokens of a justice unappeas'd, “To Philip's soul more terrors have they brought, “Than ere, when for religion arm'd he sought “Judæa's shore, he felt from Pagan force. “Is it thy cause, with guilt fraternal fraught, “Which thus unnerves my arm? Is that the source “Whence flows the stream accurs'd of impotent remorse?” V “No visions have I seen,” the Prince rejoin'd, “Nor has my eye the ghastly forms perceiv'd, “Which apprehension pourtrays to thy mind. “My soul, more constant, never yet believ'd “The tales by superstitious fancy weav'd, “Told by some gossip on a winter's night, “When, the rude labours of the day atchiev'd, “Her gaping audience shudder with affright, “And tremble as they hear of ghosts array'd in white. VI “I leave such trash to women and to fools, “To those whom, shrinking from eternal doom “And led by priests, imagination rules. “For them embodied spirits, from the tomb “Forcing their way, may hover in the gloom, “Their dread chains clanking prophesy of woe, “Tell of rich treasures buried in earth's womb, “And gambol 'till the dawn's loud herald crow. “Sufficient 'tis for me life's real pains to know. VII “Once was I envied and by all esteem'd, “Till, list'ning to thy arts by Hell devis'd, “Caught by professions which sincere I deem'd, “Thy crafty tongue my better sense surpriz'd. “Avenging Heav'n my folly has chastiz'd. “Oh had I virtue's dictates still pursued, “Had I thy guileful blandishments despis'd, “Then might I still pre-eminent have stood, “And 'scap'd the damning guilt of perj'ry and of blood! VIII “Far wiser had it been, ah! how more just! “While yet unstain'd my faith, a Brother's love “And oft-experienc'd tenderness to trust, “Than thus, compell'd from Albion to remove, “The scorn of him who wrought my fall to prove. “If Heav'n will yet receive a wretch's pray'r, “My earnest suit shall reach the throne above, “Victory and fame for Richard to prepare, “For thee defeat and shame, remorse and long despair!” IX Thus spoke the conscious Prince, while from each eye Fell drops of agony, and deeply swell'd From his torn bosom a repentant sigh. Disdain awhile the King in silence held, But quickly, by indignant warmth impell'd, He turn'd to vent the fury of his breast, When Satan, who their angry gests beheld, Anxious to terminate their vain contest, His bold associate thus imperiously address'd. X “Mark! how yon fools against each other rail, “Each his accomplice eager to revile, “And fondly hoping his own faults to veil. “Ev'n Hell's stern spirits cannot chuse but smile, “When they behold their sordid engines toil “To mask their baseness under virtue's guise, “And conscience with their schemes to reconcile: “As if such poor contrivance could suffice, “Their foul intents to screen from Heav'n's all-piercing eyes. XI “'Tis transport worthy of infernal skill, “To view the struggling and half-vanquish'd soul, “Led on from crime to crime, entangled still, “And still compell'd to own our high controul: “To hear man curse the subtlety which stole “Insidious empire o'er his weaken'd heart; “Still framing new pretences, to console “For added sin, yet by our potent art “From virtue's bound'ry forc'd still further to depart. XII “Such vain conceits these disputants inspire: “But let them thus no more the moments spend, “Which active zeal and enterprise require. “Let it be thine their idle feud to end: “Take Longchamp's form, and on the tow'r descend “Where now with threat'ning mien they converse hold; “Chase their remorse, and their stern spirits bend “To deeds of dread import and action bold. “Unveil thy stratagems, thy potent arts unfold.” XIII He said. Not long th' obedient Dæmon stay'd: In semblance of the Priest, whose counsels sly The first foundation of their league had laid, He sought the Princes, as defiance high Sat on each brow, and each resentful eye With inward scorn and deep resentment flam'd, Bespeaking instant strife. Approaching nigh, With courteous deference he attention claim'd, And well-dissembling thus his subtle project fram'd. XIV “Princes! well met! At this unusual hour, “Your faithful Longchamp, ever glad to shew “His vigilance and zeal, has sought your tow'r. “Since here arriv'd the legions of our foe, “My watchful cares have been engross'd to know “What is their state, and how they are employ'd; “Conceiving that, by some immediate blow, “The force which now we dread may be destroy'd, “Ere by it's efforts prompt ourselves shall be annoy'd. XV “Nor has my diligent research been vain. “My spies the English armament have found, “Exhausted by their labours on the main, “Throughout their spreading camp in slumbers bound, “In wassel and in wine their senses drown'd, “Their fires extinguish'd, and the maudlin guard “Heedlessly tracing their uncertain round, “Complaining of the hardships of their ward, “And envying the repose from which they are debarr'd. XVI “Where old Normannia's palace rears it's tow'rs, “And o'er the Park which round it's moat is trac'd, “Half shrouded by the forest, sternly lours, “Fair Berengaria and her train are plac'd. “It's antient battlements, repair'd in haste, “By an exhausted multitude are mann'd, “Who listlessly their tedious vigils waste, “And who, unnerv'd by toil, would ill withstand “The unforeseen attack of a determin'd band. XVII “Richard himself, engag'd with Leicester's Chief, “Within the city's walls consumes the night, “In framing projects for the town's relief, “And marshalling the order of the fight: “While many a hardy warrior with delight “And loud acclaim salutes his long-lost friend; “Pleas'd their past toils and perils to recite, “They quaff the sparkling bowl, and as they spend “The hour in talk, they fail to duty to attend. XVIII “In their supineness is our 'vantage found. “While from our line, and from St. James's height, “Loud shouts of war the ear of midnight wound, “And from our engines with tremendous flight “Our missile rocks on Rouen's ramparts light, “Silent, and shrouded by night's mantle dark, “Let us their camp assail; while on the right “Some chosen troops, with a swift sailing bark, “Seize on the royal train reposing in the Park. XIX “On this th' attainment of my hope depends: “Nor will, I trust, the enterprise be vain. “If on the bold attempt success attends, “The prize will well repay my Monarch's pain. “While in his hands such hostages remain, “On his own terms with Richard he may meet: “Anxious these valued pledges to regain, “The baffled King inglorious will retreat, “And Normandy again her rightful lord shall greet.” XX Thus spake the Fiend, and either Chief well pleas'd His scheme replete with mighty mischief scann'd: Smooth'd were their brows, their anger was appeas'd; With courteous bearing, and demeanour bland, Each emulously caught the other's hand, And clasp'd his base associate to his breast. Meantime the Dæmon his arrangements plann'd, And, as he instant execution press'd, Thus England's recreant Prince he craftily address'd. XXI “Your purpose if my wishes could decide, “(Which flow from friendship and attachment strong) “You, Royal Sir! the enterprise should guide. “Success and fame to him of right belong, “Whom fate and fortune have combin'd to wrong. “Beauty and love my hero's toils invite, “Such as no poet in voluptuous song “E'er yet describ'd, such as may well requite “Thy former pains and shame with exquisite delight. XXII “Fresh as the breath of all-reviving spring, “Sweet as the fragrance of the new-blown rose, “Blooms the fair daughter of the Cyprian King. “Her pow'r, 'tis said, thy happier Brother knows. “Arouse thee then, nor by inaction lose “The blest occasion to revenge thy harms. “Disdain the perils which th' attempt oppose: “Think on his pangs, when in thy circling arms “The panting fair one sinks, and yields her matchless charms.” XXIII As spake th' insidious Dæmon, o'er the soul Of late-repentant John a lustful fire, Sublim'd by hate, despair, and vengeance, stole. “Longchamp!” he cried, “thy words my breast inspire “With mounting ecstasy and mad desire. “Oh! that my Brother might himself behold “The joys to which my fervid hopes aspire, “When in my arms his minion I infold, “When to unpractis'd love her melting heart I mould. XXIV “The triumph and the transport both be thine,” Exclaim'd the Gallic King; “to thy command “The guidance of the project I consign: “Convey her swiftly to some distant strand, “Crown'd with success, by fav'ring breezes fann'd; “While we with energetic zeal prepare “To lead to action our determin'd band, “By whose exertions we may hope to share “In toils, more glorious made by England's King's despair.” XXV He said. Forthwith, descending from the tow'r, To the throng'd camp the Monarch bent his way, His Chiefs to summon and arrange his pow'r. He bad Bourgeville and gallant La Vallee Prepare a bark, and England's Prince obey; While Mountford, Nanteuil and renown'd Fierreville Their dread machines against the town should play, And war-tried Blangie should, with practis'd skill, Invade the careless camp, and horror's work fulfil. XXVI His foul device while thus the foe prepar'd, England's brave King in consultation sat, With those who Rouen's long defence had shar'd. Well pleas'd he heard bold Leicester's Earl relate Their recent suff'rings, and their actual state, Their constant valour, and yet cherish'd hope: As the night older grew, their grave debate Devis'd new means to give their ardour scope, And with presumptuous France more certainly to cope. XXVII While thus the aptest modes of war they sought, And England's King attention yet bespoke, Suddenly, sounds with dreadful import fraught On every side astonishment awoke. Throughout the town with devastating stroke Fragments of rocks the shatter'd buildings rent, Crush'd their proud roofs, their massy timbers broke: The spreading ramparts felt their dire descent, And the wide battlements beneath their fury bent. XXVIII In ev'ry quarter, shrieks of wild despair, With lamentations mix'd and outcries loud And groans of wounded warriors, fill'd the air. Vainly the trembling and half-naked croud Sought from approaching fate themselves to shroud; Vainly to every Saint, whose boasted aid They oft with pray'rs invok'd, rich gifts they vow'd: No intercession their destruction stay'd, On their devoted heads the deadly show'r still play'd. XXIX Soon as the din he heard, in anxious haste Richard, by Chiefs surrounded, left the hall, And thro' the multitude close-thronging trac'd His course, oft-interrupted, tow'rds the wall. Nor horrors him nor dangers could appal: He bad his host their engines straight advance, Exert their zeal, their victories past recal, And, pouring vengeance on the troops of France, By deeds of new desert their well-earn'd fame enhance. XXX They, nothing loth, his high command obey'd. To the full stretch their Catapultas bent, Of stones and darts a show'r destructive play'd: Swift thro' the air the charge o'erwhelming went: The ramparts of the Gallic camp it rent, And crush'd their legions with it's pond'rous force, As in array they stood and order pent. Th' ensanguin'd plain was spread with many a corse, And cries of death were heard and imprecations hoarse. XXXI Meantime, the Dæmon to St. James's mount With savage exultation bent his flight, Th' attainment of his purpose to recount. Him as Hell's Sov'reign heard with stern delight, Heav'n was obscur'd with clouds: the murky night O'er nature's face her foul dominion spread: Veil'd was the moon: no star to mortal sight Athwart th' expanse it's twinkling lustre shed; All seem'd involv'd in gloom, thick-mantling, black and dread. XXXII “Hither,” exclaim'd th' imperious King, “repair “With instant speed, ye ministers of woe! “Hither, ye mighty rulers of the air! “Hasten, your deadly attributes to shew. “Bursting your northern caves, ye wild winds blow! “Ye thunders roll, ye livid light'nings fly! “Combine your efforts to astound our foe! “With congregated force your labours ply, “Shake earth's foundations deep, convulse the troubled sky!” XXXIII He said. His voice the Pow'rs Infernal heard, And from Hell's caves their fearful progress wound, Prompt to obey his desolating word. Thro' the thick air, in spells accursed bound, Rush'd the fell storm: the tempest howl'd around With blast portentous: flames sulphureous gleam'd, Precursors of the rattling thunder's sound: From the swoln clouds mephitic meteors stream'd, And, as aloft they soar'd, malignant Dæmons scream'd. XXXIV “'Tis well, brave Spirits!” Satan loudly cried, “Where'er the banners of the English tow'r, “Extend your sway, and spread your terrors wide: “But from the path, thro' which his chosen pow'r “The Prince conducts tow'rds old Normannia's bow'r, “Withhold your fury; there let calmness dwell, “And silence her oblivious influence show'r: “Let his wide sails propitious breezes swell, “And to assur'd success his nimble bark propel.” XXXV The Dæmons not unwillingly obey'd: Their King's commandment eager to inforce, Each his address and puissance dire display'd. Where thro' the town and camp the full concourse Of mingled Chiefs they saw, with deadly force They stretch'd their noxious and remorseless sway: Thro' the black atmosphere their bellowings hoarse Re-echo'd loud; confusion mark'd their way, Destruction wav'd her brand, and scatter'd wide dismay. XXXVI In slumbers deep the English bands were lost, From labours past and late excesses bred When bold Blangie the Seine's broad current cross'd, And tow'rds the camp his martial comrades led. On ev'ry hand the shades of death they spread. Not otherwise, amid the fleecy train Wolves from their mountains rush: with carnage red They tear their unsuspecting prey, and stain With slaughter's bloody work the flow'r-bespangled plain. XXXVII Beneath their fury brave Fitz-Walter sank: Bigod, who erst proud Acre's ramparts scal'd, Their pow'r confess'd; his gore the herbage drank, And fate the warrior's eyes in darkness veil'd. Not Verdun now preserv'd his cuirass mail'd, Nor could bold Umphraville his hauberk shield; Against them Gallic persidy prevail'd: No more their arms 'gainst England's foes to wield, By trait'rous swords they fell, and press'd th' ensanguin'd field. XXXVIII As 'mid the gloom, by bloody thirst impell'd And hope of booty, eager De la Motte, With cautious steps his course destructive held, The polish'd haubergeon and rich surcoat Of Sacey lost in sleep he chanc'd to note. Him, thro' his broad and unprotected breast, With fatal stroke the base marauder smote, Then, of his gay habiliments possess'd, In search of further prey he re-commenc'd his quest. XXXIX Fitz-Warren, as reposing in his tent Exhausted by unusual toil he lay, To early death his biting faulchion sent. Him, all unus'd to war, his father grey Had charg'd in arms to make his first essay, And knighthood won by valour to assume: Unapprehensive of the fatal day, When for his son he should erect the tomb, Lament his blighted hopes, and mourn his hapless doom. XL Not far remote, unconscious of the foe Invading thus his rest, beneath the shade Of his high canopy repos'd De Preaux: Near him his golden-studded arms were laid, His splendid casque, and highly polish'd blade; While, as of former warlike feats he dream'd, A smile of transport o'er his visage play'd. Him, thro' the shade as bright his cuirass beam'd, Perfidious De la Motte his easy victim deem'd. XLI Tow'rds him full cautiously the caitiff crept; His quick'ning pulse and pallid cheek bespoke His fear, as 'gainst the warrior while he slept With felon hand he aim'd a murd'rous stroke. The weapon swerving with his effort broke. Foil'd in his foul attempt, with dread he gasp'd, As from his slumber brave De Preaux awoke: His yet uplifted arm the Chieftain grasp'd, And cried, as he beheld the dagger which he clasp'd, XLII “Say who thou art, and on what purpose bent? “Why at this hour forbidden dost thou dare “With bold obtrusion to invade my tent, “And wherefore dost thou thus thy weapon bare? “Speak, miscreant! or for instant death prepare!” “Mercy! most potent Lord!” th' assassin cried, “Suspend thy wrath while I the truth declare: “If of what most imports thee ought I hide, “Be thy forgiveness now and future grace denied! XLIII “Our Gallic troops, with Blangie at their head, “Are masters of thy unprotected post, “And death and havock thro' thy wide camp spread. “Uncheck'd they range amid thy sleeping host: “Ere this, I ween, full many an English ghost “Skims thro' the gloom and shivers in the storm. “Hark! heard you not yon shout? 'Tis the loud boast “Of bands victorious, who with slaughter warm “Their course successful hold, their fatal task perform.” XLIV No more De Preaux permitted him to tell; With pow'rful gripe the traitor's throat he crush'd: Convuls'd and lifeless to the earth he fell, While from his mouth a crimson'd torrent gush'd. Forth from his tent the Chief indignant rush'd: “Comrades!” he loudly cried, “awake! awake! “Behold th' insidious foe, with carnage flush'd, “Of your unguarded state advantage take! “With England's noblest blood their foul revenge they slake!” XLV He said. Nor sounded his dread voice in vain. Blondel, who sleep's seducing pow'r disclaim'd, While, to his ready harp, the rapt'rous strain Of love and endless constancy he fram'd For her whose beauties his fond heart inflam'd, Rush'd from his tent, and quickly tow'rds the Knight Advancing, thus impatiently exclaim'd: “Say, why amid the silence of the night “Prevails thy cry, our host from slumbers to excite?” XLVI “Yon base assassin drench'd in blood behold,” Replied the Chief: “Ere yet my vengeance due “Gave him to death, the dreadful tale he told. “In English gore the French their swords imbrue: “By Blangie led, remorseless they pursue “Throughout our line their sanguinary trade: “While yet we speak, their murders they renew. “Quickly our suff'ring comrades let us aid, “And save our friends whom fond security betray'd.” XLVII As yet he spoke, shrieks and laments arose, Which either Chieftain's heart with pity wrung, And call'd for retribution on the foes. Forthwith Blondel the bugle-horn unslung, Which from his rich embroider'd baldrick hung, And thro' the tube a blast so potent pour'd, That the wide camp and Seine's embankments rung. Tho' rag'd the storm, tho' deaf'ning thunders roar'd, Tho' madd'ning Dæmons howl'd, imperiously it soar'd. XLVIII No longer now th' unheeding warriors slept. Soon as prevail'd the sound with terror fraught, Each from his couch precipitately leap'd, And hastily his spear and faulchion caught, Tho' still what caus'd th' alarm they vainly sought. Blondel again awoke his vig'rous strain, And 'mid the tempest so distinctly wrought, That, doubtful now no more, the martial train From ev'ry quarter rush'd impatient o'er the plain. XLIX Attentive stood the warlike pair, and turn'd Tow'rds ev'ry side the passing steps to hear, When eagerly advancing they discern'd War-tried Fitz-Gerald and renown'd Brywere; One grasp'd a sword, the other pois'd a spear: Castellun next, wielding his weapon keen, With De la Roche and Tancarville drew near; Blondel scarce mark'd them, when, with anxious mien, Hast'ning across the field bold Somerville was seen. L Them following Harcourt and Lestang they saw, Warwick and Albemarle: nor long delay'd To join them brave Mauleon and Dubois. In quick succession Warren they survey'd, With Gournay, whom, as he his progress made, The puissant Earl had summon'd from his tent; St. Paul, and Reginald, to join their aid, Thro' the deep gloom their course together bent, Eager alike to learn what the dread summons meant. LI “Hasten, my brave companions!” cried Blondel, “Prepare your wonted energy to shew, “And Philip's forces from the camp repel! “While negligently we repos'd, the foe “Our station has surpriz'd; already flow “Torrents of English blood: our warriors brave, “While yet we speak, fall victims of their blow. “Let us our fame redeem, our comrades save, “Or rush on death, and share their fortunes and their grave!” LII He said. At his soul-harrowing words amaz'd, Believing now, now lost in wild surprize, The Chieftains on Blondel disorder'd gaz'd, When far around them burst discordant cries, Shouts of defiance, mix'd with plaints and sighs, Now in the war of elements half-drown'd, Now in full chorus echoing to the skies: Too well confirm'd the fatal truth they found, And ev'ry heart recoil'd as rose the fearful sound. LIII “What mean these dismal cries?” exclaim'd Blondel, “Heralds of ruin and approaching doom, “The fate of Granville they appear to tell. “Hark! from his quarter louder yet they come! “And see, half-shrouded in the midnight gloom, “Advancing tow'rds us a tumultuous crew; “Now they give way! now courage they assume! “Now turn they on their foes, who still pursue, “And on destruction bent their massacre renew!” LIV Mov'd by the piteous sight, each gen'rous Peer Grasp'd his good weapon, rais'd his pond'rous shield, And onward rush'd the fainting band to cheer. Now quickly chang'd the fortune of the field: Compell'd to English energy to yield, The Gallic forces in their turn gave way. On every crest remorseless vengeance peal'd: As if their debt with int'rest to repay, And emulous of fame, the Chieftains spread dismay. LV Nought could their prowess and their zeal withstand: Each stroke the tale of retribution swell'd, And thinn'd the ranks of the retreating band, When, as their course of victory they impell'd, By foes surrounded Granville they beheld. He, like a stag forc'd from his native wood, At bay his fierce and boastful hunters held, Who, tho' from numbers bold and hot for blood, Shrank from his menac'd wrath, and at a distance stood. LVI Careless of life, their legions he assail'd, And, tho' their force sufficient seem'd to quell A single arm, his constancy avail'd Their still augmenting forces to repel. Grammont beneath his sturdy faulchion fell: His puissance felt Duplessis, who 'till late Was wont on Loire's luxuriant banks to dwell In princely guise; nor did a milder fate Roscelin from fair Auxerre, or bold Aumale await. LVII These own'd the pow'r of his resistless blade, But others still advanc'd with rage inflam'd, When stern Mauleon, who the strife survey'd, With rapid steps advancing thus exclaim'd: “Hence, recreants! whose ignoble deeds have sham'd “Knighthood's renown and honour's high behest!” Then, rushing 'mid the croud, a blow he aim'd With force o'erwhelming on St. Vallery's crest, Who with imprudent zeal before his comrades press'd. LVIII A youthful Chief was he, whom war's alarms Led from the vine-clad hills of rich Champaigne, Where bounteous nature, prodigal of charms, Had deck'd with matchless gifts his wide domain. His lifeless limbs were stretch'd upon the plain. Him falling saw his oft-tried friend Rigaud; With indignation fir'd and heart-felt pain He sought t' avenge him on his furious foe: Nor inefficient prov'd his well-directed blow. LIX It pierc'd his vizor, and upon his cheek Infixed a deep and honourable wound: But he, impatient his revenge to wreak, Struck on his casque with waving plumage crown'd, And beat the vaunting Frenchman to the ground. Gasping, he oft essay'd to raise his head; But death his senses in oblivion bound, And round the warrior his dark shadows spread: To join his comrade lov'd his struggling spirit fled. LX While thus Mauleon well maintain'd the fight, And while the foe, victorious now no more, Their only hope of safety sought in flight, Blangie, their state perceiving, to restore The battle lost, his reinforcement bore, And urg'd his host the risk of war to brave. As, when a tempest rages, on the shore Remounts with doubled energy the wave Which seem'd t' have left the strand, so on the Chieftain drave. LXI “Oh shame! when masters of the well-earn'd field, “When crown'd with conquest's wreath,” he loudly cried, “Shall Gallia's war-tried sons the victory yield? “Thus by Blangie their force shall be defied!” Him heard Blondel, who straightway thus replied: “To those, whose perfidy has wrought our harm, “By Heav'nly justice is the palm denied. “Tho' round thee hosts of murd'rous traitors swarm, “Prepare to meet the force of my avenging arm!” LXII Blangie with proud disdain his threat receiv'd. A warrior braver or of nobler race France boasted not; his valour had atchiev'd Deeds such as history might delight to trace, Or poets with immortal verse might grace. Anxious no more for fame, he liv'd retir'd, 'Till Philip's voice bad him again incase His limbs in steel: by loyal feelings fir'd, He now by fresh desert to crown his fame aspir'd. LXIII As either Chief advanc'd to the attack, Still'd was the clamour; the expecting croud Impress'd with awe on ev'ry side fell back. As from the bosom of an angry cloud Heav'n's bolt bursts forth with intonation loud, The rival heroes to the combat rush'd. Their high-arch'd crests beneath their faulchions bow'd, Their mails were rent, their polish'd helms were crush'd, And streams of 'crimson'd gore from every fissure gush'd. LXIV Each seem'd with equal force and valour fraught, And both with equal skill th' occasion fleet Which varying fortune gave observant caught, Now grappling close, now feigning to retreat, Now springing on their foe's attack to meet. At length mischance prevail'd Blangie to quell: The turf with carnage wet betray'd his feet, He slip'd, he stagger'd, and to earth he fell, While waving high his blade stood o'er him brave Blondel. LXV “Yield thee, Sir Knight!” the youthful victor cried; “To those whose gallant feats distinction claim “Our English clemency is ne'er denied.” “I ask no mercy! when a warrior's name,” Replied the Chief, “is stigmatiz'd by shame, “Ill it becomes him to desire to live. “Add to thine own Blangie's once-tow'ring fame, “While he, disgrace unable to survive, “Asks death, which now alone can consolation give.” LXVI “Tho' thy impatient soul,” Blondel rejoin'd, “Impel thee thus in haughty terms to speak, “From us a milder sentence thou shalt find. “I scorn to take what thou disdain'st to seek. “Ne'er will Blondel on those his vengeance wreak, “Whom fate's reverses to his pow'r subject: “He wars not with the impotent and weak! “Bear him away: treat him with due respect, “'Till Richard's sov'reign voice his destiny direct.” LXVII They led him off, tho' still for death he call'd, Proudly contemning life by pity sav'd. His foll'wers, by their leader's fate appall'd, No more the fury of their conquerors brav'd, But, throwing down their arms, for quarter crav'd: Nor vainly, for compassion valour crown'd. But now the tempest more intensely rav'd, New thunders roll'd, new light'nings flash'd around, And shouts were heard, and cries, of pow'r the soul t'astound. LXVIII Dreadful they rose, as when a sea-wall yields To waves o'erwhelming, and with ruthless force A foaming ocean deluges the fields, Sweeps o'er the ravag'd plains with bellowings hoarse, And marks with ruin it's portentous course. “What mean these new alarms?” exclaim'd Blondel: “Surely some Dæmons, strangers to remorse, “And arm'd with all the potency of Hell, “Ride in the troubled air, and frame their deadly spell!” LXIX “Be they from Hell, or from our trait'rous foe,” Mauleon cried, “it suits not us to stay: “For past neglect a debt immense we owe, “Which wounded honour calls on us to pay.” Thus saying, hastily he led the way. The Chieftains soon a croud tumultuous view'd, Flying in wild disorder and dismay, While a victorious host their steps pursued, And, hanging on their rear, their progress mark'd with blood. LXX As when a farmer, fearful lest some storm His promis'd hopes of harvest may defeat, Fresh reapers sends his labour to perform, And bids each band their portion'd task complete; Beneath their sickles bends the yellow wheat, Strenuous they urge their toil, nor think of rest 'Till in the centre of the field they meet: So on the French their fierce pursuers press'd, While stern Mauleon strove their impulse to arrest. LXXI Thro' their devoted mass destruction reign'd, On every quarter desolation spread, And sanguin'd torrents the wide champaign stain'd, When, proudly striding over heaps of dead, Hot with fatigue, his sword with slaughter red, Richard, advancing to Mauleon's band, Exclaim'd, “Awhile suspend your vengeance dread; “Matters of greater import now demand “Our instant vigilance, perhaps our succouring hand. LXXII “Too well th' events of this disast'rous hour “Our subtle foe's devices have declar'd. “Say, has my Queen escap'd their ruthless pow'r? “Have they my lovely Berengaria spar'd, “Or while, oh agonizing thought! they dar'd “Presumptuously her palace to invade, “Has she the common lot of insult shar'd? “Oh! say, may yet avail her Richard's aid, “Or has relentless fate my fondest hopes betray'd?” LXXIII Thus saying, he awaited their reply. The sad reflexion which his words awoke Drew from each pitying warrior's breast a sigh; As if afraid enquiry to provoke, Confus'd they gaz'd around, but no one spoke, When lo! half-breathless, and with action warm, Thro' their close ranks impatient Audley broke; “Comrades!” he cried, “for instant action arm! “Fly to protect your Queen and ward th' impending harm!” LXXIV Then, as the King he saw, who fix'd in grief And panting from indignant feelings stood, “Pembroke,” aloud he cried, “implores relief! “Well has he stemm'd the desolating flood, “And his good sword, distain'd with Gallic blood, “As yet has frustrated their base intent: “But, as against their efforts oft renew'd “Ill may suffice his troops with labour spent, “Me to request your aid the gallant Chief has sent.” LXXV As when a tygress hears her young one's cries, Whom from her den a band of hunters bears, Rage fills her heart, with light'nings flash her eyes; Pursuing quickly, present death she dares, She rushes 'midst her foes, their limbs she tears, Resistance goads her on to slaughters new, And none her fury work'd to madness spares: So fierce, so terrible, against the crew Whose felon aim he learn'd imperial Richard flew. LXXVI Still thro' the troubled air the tempest swell'd, Still in dire chorus adverse Dæmons screech'd: He unappall'd his way impetuous held. Crossing the camp, the tow'ring wood he reach'd, Which round the palace deep-embow'ring stretch'd: It's intermingling boughs, it's mantling shade, It's mossy trunks which time's slow hand had bleach'd, Full often his bewilder'd steps betray'd; Yet nought his purpose check'd, and nought his ardour stay'd. LXXVII Th' entangled path he resolutely trac'd: Tho' thorns and brambles oft oppos'd his way, As if combin'd to mock his eager haste, By love and vengeance fir'd he spurn'd delay. His comrades brave, their ardour to display, Strove thro' the gloomy brakes a path to force: No perils could their wild impatience stay, But, guided by the shouts and outcries hoarse, Now near and plainly heard, impell'd their vigorous course. LXXVIII Their courage soon all obstacles surpass'd; Upon the plain which edg'd the wood they burst, And, as around their eager eyes they cast, Beheld on every side the guard dispers'd, And by the foe pursued, whose bloody thirst Seem'd with increase of carnage to augment: Still, as with murd'rous zeal and rage accurs'd They urg'd their toil, beneath their faulchions bent The English host, and Heav'n with piercing shrieks was rent. LXXIX New fury in each Chieftain's heart arose: By common feelings and resentment fir'd, They rush'd resistless on th' insulting foes. As if by more than human pow'rs inspir'd, They smote the traitors, who, by slaughter tir'd More feebly the disputed field maintain'd. Now England's Chiefs atonement full requir'd, Now, in it's turn, French gore the field distain'd, Death o'er them shook his dart, and horror round them reign'd. LXXX While thus the fearful din of battle rag'd, Superior cares and more distracting thought The lab'ring breast of England's King engag'd. Thro' the thick gloom which hell's enchantments wrought, His eager glance the Norman Palace sought. Hid were it's turrets; thro' the veil of night Scarcely his eye it's waving outline caught, Tho' here and there, with coruscation slight, A torch was seen to glare and shed a partial light. LXXXI But soon their bearers, issuing from the gate, With sudden glare the midnight gloom dispell'd: Loud shrieks were heard, and threats of hostile hate; The chorus dread a struggling female swell'd, Whom in his grasp a sturdy warrior held. Regardless of her pray'rs and cries he seem'd, And quickly from the wall his course impell'd, While in the wind her floating tresses stream'd, And oft she wrung her hands, and oft for succour scream'd. LXXXII As on the Knight their rays the torches shed, Richard his cuirass and the helm descried Adorn'd with costly gems which grac'd his head; Where, mid the waving plumes with crimson dyed, Was seen a golden circlet, spreading wide His princely state and lineage to proclaim. “And is it thus,” indignantly he cried, “Forgetful of his duty and his fame, “A brother seeks to crown his oft-recorded shame? LXXXIII “Shade of our Sire! thy recreant son behold! “Sanction my vengeance on the wretch who spurn'd “At honour's laws, seduc'd by Gallic gold?” No more; for now his breast with fury burn'd, The intermediate ranks he swift o'erturn'd, And peopled Hell's domains with bleeding swarms, When, on his right, he suddenly discern'd A second warrior, bearing in his arms A captive fair, whose cries increas'd night's dread alarms. LXXXIV He, deaf to pity, still his course pursued, Surrounded by a loud tumultuous band, Whose taunts increas'd as she her plaints renew'd, All prompt to execute the dire command Of him whose savage soul the deed had plann'd. The warlike King his vig'rous progress check'd, When thus she cried: “Oh! where is Richard's hand “His faithful Berengaria to protect! “Just Heav'n! my hero's arm to save his love direct!” LXXXV Deep fell her accents in his stricken soul: As o'er his cheek a flush of passion pass'd, Forward he rush'd with rage which mock'd controul. Not more the dread Simoom, with fatal blast From Afric's sandy plains approaching fast, Spreads desolation, ruin and dismay: Th' insulting miscreants stood with fear aghast, As thro' their crouded ranks he hew'd his way, While round him drench'd in gore full many a Chieftain lay. LXXXVI With his left hand he grip'd the warrior's throat Who bore the Queen, and on his plumed crest With good Excalibor he rudely smote. Nought could his weapon's temper'd edge arrest: It clove his head, and to his rugged breast Pass'd with resistless impulse, while a tide Of gushing blood distain'd his 'broider'd vest. He fell, but Richard caught his trembling bride, And, as her fears he sooth'd, exultingly thus cried. LXXXVII “Courage, my love! the ruffian's hand no more “Thy gentle nature shall prevail to harm; “Here art thou safe: amid the tempest's roar, “The cries of war, and battle's dread alarm, “Propitious Heav'n to save thee led mine arm. “Oh Berengaria! raise thy drooping head, “Let thy dear voice thy constant Richard charm!” She, still o'ercome by recollections dread, While tears her glowing cheeks bedew'd thus fondly said. LXXXVIII “Oh Richard! dearer to my woe-worn heart “Than all that crowns or lavish pomp can give, “Do I then hold thee never more to part? “While others, prompted by ambition, strive “Glory from war's rude conflicts to derive, “My timid soul abhors their toil uncouth. “Ah! why, when thus to tenderness alive, “Should fate deny to Berengaria's truth “Her first, her only wish, thy suff'ring breast to sooth!” LXXIX “Thy fond affection, love!” the King rejoin'd, “By endless gratitude shall be repaid: “But cares more earnest now engage my mind. “As hither I repair'd to bring thee aid, “I saw a damsel, whom the foe convey'd “From yonder walls; the torches dimly gleam'd “Athwart the gloom, and ill her form display'd; “But, as their radiance on her visage stream'd, “Half by her tresses hid, she Chariclæa seem'd.” XC “'Tis she,” replied the Queen; “at midnight hour, “When in my chamber we reposing lay, “She fell a victim to remorseless pow'r. “Insatiate ruffians, eager for their prey, “Bore her when torn from my embrace away, “While, struggling, she in vain for succour cried, “And strove to move high Heav'n. Oh! who can say “What mis'ries may my lovely friend betide, “From those whom licence wild and lawless passions guide!” XCI As thus the weeping Berengaria spoke, From ev'ry eye drops wrung by pity fell, And rage in every manly breast awoke, When, rushing forward, thus exclaim'd Blondel: “Tho' arm'd with all the potency of Hell, “Tho' fiends may guide them, and tho' dæmons shield, “My vengeful sword the traitors shall compel “The prize their perfidy acquir'd to yield, “Howe'er by force upheld, howe'er by fraud conceal'd. XCII “My honest freedom, gracious King! forgive, “When, in this presence, I presume to shew “The secret of my heart. For her I live! “For her I've breath'd th' irrevocable vow “Of deathless truth! My humble suit allow! “Let the great enterprize to me belong! “Heav'n will my hand with tenfold force endow: “Guided by love, urg'd by resentment strong, “Blondel shall soon avenge his Chariclæa's wrong!” XCIII “Thy boon be granted,” cried the feeling Prince: “No more the purpose of thy soul arrest, “But all thy gen'rous energies evince. “May'st thou, successful in thy daring quest, “Redeem the maid by trait'rous power oppress'd! “May'st thou from harm her modest beauties guard! “And, when th' event thy efforts shall have bless'd, “May nought thy well-earn'd happiness retard, But may her virgin charms thy love and worth reward!” XCIV He said. Blondel's sad heart with rapture swell'd, But, ere he could reply, they Pembroke view'd, Who by the arm a trembling captive held; His helm and hauberk were distain'd with blood, And from his pallid cheeks the vital flood Was fast receding. “As across the plain,” The Earl exclaim'd, “the traitors I pursued, “Closely their steps I follow'd, but in vain, “'Till to the spot we came where winds the lordly Seine. XCV “A bark we saw moor'd closely by the shore, “To which, attended by his band, a Knight “Grasp'd in his rude embrace a damsel bore. “Surrounding darkness mock'd my eager sight, “Yet such was Chariclæa's form and height, “And such the garb in which she late appear'd. “Her loud lament and shrieks of wild affright “Struck to my soul, as they their anchor clear'd, “And with a favouring breeze down the mid-current steer'd. XCVI “In vain their progress we essay'd to check, “For now along the stream they swiftly sail'd, “When their unworthy leader, from the deck, “With boastful phrase thus his pursuers hail'd: ‘Tell your proud King, altho' his arms prevail'd ‘To drive me from an almost vanquish'd realm, ‘That now my bold endeavours have not fail'd: ‘Let his lov'd minion's loss his soul o'erwhelm, ‘While vengeance crowns my toils, and love directs my helm.’ XCVII “As thus he spake, far distant from the shore “The force united of the wind and tide “Beyond our ken th' insulting Chieftain bore. “Ranging along the strand with slaughter dy'd, “This wounded warrior 'mid the dead I spied: “Haply, his knowledge of their foul intent, “Hardly from him conceal'd, my King may guide “To ascertain what course the vessel bent, “And ere too late their plans atrocious to prevent.” XCVIII “Speak! or this weapon shall avenge her cause,” Blondel exclaim'd as tow'rds the Chief he sprung. With interrupted voice, after a pause, He thus began: “Ne'er should thy threat'ning tongue “Th' important secret from my breast have wrung: “But thoughts of graver import now impress “And urge my fleeting soul, by conscience stung, “The Prince's daring purpose to confess, “And, far as words avail, my errors to redress. XCIX “By that All-seeing Pow'r, before whose throne “My disembodied spirit soon must stand, “Thus all I chanc'd to learn I truly own. “To John, who doubtless the deep scheme had plann'd, “My royal master gave a bark well mann'd, “In which he now directs his rapid course “Tow'rds Fecan's walls, which o'er our northern strand “Sublimely tow'ring mock the billows hoarse, “By art and nature form'd to baffle human force. C “There, when securely shelter'd from his foes, “'Tis his intent to profit by his prize, “And terms of high advantage to propose. “He means the maid—But more my strength denies— “The hand of fate hangs heavy on mine eyes— “My widow'd wife! my much-lov'd babes! adieu— “Oh! may that Pow'r, whose fost'ring care supplies—” No more the Chieftain added; death's pale hue O'erspread his cheeks, his soul to Heav'n's tribunal flew. CI “Too well,” said Richard, “has his tale declar'd, “Tho' half untold remains, th' accurs'd design. “Let a swift bark be instantly prepar'd! “Blondel! th' important enterprize be thine; “And let such warriors, as may wish to join “In brave redemption of the captive fair, “With thee their zeal and gallantry combine: “While we to Rouen and the camp repair, “Left to renew th' assault our vengeful foe should dare.” CII The Monarch said, and with his Queen retir'd. Blondel on high his sanguin'd sword display'd, And call'd his bold associates; they, inspir'd With glory's flame, no hesitation made. Fifty good Knights he chose, in steel array'd, Who erst on Judah's shores with him had fought, And offer'd now their voluntary aid. The ready mariners with vigour wrought, And soon the favouring breeze their spreading canvass caught. END OF BOOK XIV. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. Council of the English—Mortimer leads a detachment to Martainville—Richard sets out with part of his army to support Blondel in his attack on Fecan—He arrives at the forest of Roumare—Machinations of the Dæmons, and temptation of Richard. I While on his daring quest Blondel advanc'd, Richard his Queen tow'rds Rouen's ramparts led. As o'er the camp's wide stretch his eye he glanc'd, Where horror yet her stern dominion spread, His sick'ning soul recoil'd, his colour fled, And, wrung by pity, an unconscious tear For many a valiant comrade lost he shed. For war's effects most dreadful then appear, When cease her loud acclaims the mounting heart to cheer. II There, wrapt in death, lay many a warrior bold: Clos'd were those eyes that once with ardour beam'd, The heart that panted for renown was cold, Crush'd was the brain which policy had schem'd, And pale those lips whence eloquence had stream'd. The felon kite and many a carrion fowl Hover'd around them, and obscenely scream'd: And from his forest haunts, with savage howl, Scenting his feast of blood, the wolf was seen to prowl. III “These are thy triumphs, War!” exclaim'd the King: “Oh! that ambition would awhile take breath, “And scan the woes which from her fury spring! “Ere yet the sword of conquest she unsheath, “Let her behold the ravages of death, “The varied pangs which her excesses cause, “Her guilty triumphs, and her blood-stain'd wreath! “Let her on these bestow a thought, and pause “Ere Heav'n she lose, to gain a servile world's applause.” IV Thus o'er th' ensanguin'd field, immers'd in woe, He pass'd, 'till to the royal tent he came. He bad th' attendants on the dead bestow Such rites as suited their heroic name, Such as were due to valour and to fame. With pious care his mandate they obey'd: Throughout the camp arose their sad acclaim, As the last tribute of regard they paid, And on each Chieftain's tomb his useless arms display'd. V Soon as was thus fulfill'd the mournful rite, And o'er the warriors slain was rear'd the mound, The King sent forth his heralds to invite The Peers to council. At the trumpet's sound, With hasten'd steps o'er the yet-reeking ground Obedient to their Monarch's will they press'd. In mute attention as they stood around, With expectation fill'd each gallant breast, He thus in measur'd terms th' assembly grave address'd. VI “'Tis not, my friends! of errors past to treat, “'Tis not on your misconduct to dilate, “Tho' dire th' effect, I summon you to meet. “Our recent loss should vigilance create, “And urge us, when assembled in debate, “Such means of future enterprize to frame, “As may be best adapted to our state, “And may most speedily redeem our shame, “And rescue from reproach our once-unsullied fame. VII “Your manly spirits will not deem it fit, “The vigour of our warriors to restrain, “Or to repeated insults to submit. “More worthy objects led us 'cross the main; “A brave and suff'ring province to sustain, “A great revenge for broken faith to wreak, “Redress and full indemnity to gain, “And by exertions new renown to seek, “We swore; nor let us now our vow recorded break. VIII “To the disclosure of my plan attend. “Blondel and his associates bold to save, “It well behoves us instant aid to lend. “Where Fecan's tow'rs the ocean's fury brave, “And proudly mock the vainly-threat'ning wave, “Perils beyond the lot of war they dare. “Their gallant efforts first attention crave: “Be it our glory, our peculiar care, “Their safety to insure, their worthy toils to share. IX “This task be mine: for, tho' he faithless prove, “Yet, on a Brother's faults when I reflect, “The fond remembrances of former love “Rush on my soul, and plead for his defect. “In him my Father's mem'ry I respect: “Tho' gross his crime, and heinous be his guilt, “A subject's hand must not his fault correct; “The blood from Him deriv'd must not be spilt, “Nor must my wish'd success on fratricide be built. X “While thus tow'rds Fecan I conduct my might, “Let Mortimer from Rouvrai pass the Seine, “And, marching under cover of the night, “Attempt the heights near Martainville to gain, “There by his presence Philip to restrain, “And keep him from attending to my course. “Meantime, my Queen in Rouen shall remain, “Where, till in triumph ends our brief divorce, “Leicester shall guard her safe from Gallia's lawless force.” XI The Chiefs approv'd as thus the Monarch spoke; Each hop'd a portion of his toils to share, And expectation in each breast awoke. To Rouen's walls, with Berengaria fair, Imperial Richard hasten'd to repair: Her to the charge of Leicester's Earl he gave; While she, oppress'd with agonizing care, Breath'd many a vow Heav'n's sov'reign aid to crave, And many a saint implor'd her hero's life to save. XII Now from his arch sublime the lamp of day Tow'rds his Atlantic couch descended fast; Athwart th' empurpled clouds his chasten'd ray, Emblem of mild beneficence, he cast, And, as his splendour gilt th' horizon vast, By grateful nature hail'd he sank to rest. Throughout the camp the mingling warriors pass'd, And, as preparing for their vent'rous quest, Each to his leader's post with gen'rous ardour press'd. XIII Nor were their efforts vain. Soon as the night Her sable mantle o'er the earth had spread, Bold Mortimer, advancing on the right, Across the Seine his firm battalions led. The full-orb'd moon her temper'd radiance shed To guide their way: they pass'd Belbœuf, Montmain, And Annebaud, where high it's branching head Her forest rear'd, and, skirting Beaulieu's plain, They march'd their destin'd post of Martainville to gain. XIV The warlike King meantime arrang'd his host, And, where the river to the south inclin'd, In close array it's ample stream they cross'd. High wav'd the knightly banners in the wind, And ev'ry Chieftain, at his post assign'd, Seem'd emulous the common toil to share. The walls of Montigny they left behind, And, as the dawn first glimmer'd in the air, Thro' the ascending mist they saw La Vaupalliere. XV The sun in clouds arose, as if averse To shew the country's desolate aspect. Far round was seen of ruthless war the curse: The fields no more with golden grain were deck'd, No more, his flock at day-break to collect, The shepherd's pipe re-echo'd from the hill; The cottages seem'd mould'ring from neglect; All was abandon'd, ruinous and still, Save when the gaunt wolf howl'd, or scream'd the owlet shrill. XVI Here, in some hut, whose half-burnt roof yet smoak'd, It's narrow door-way reeking yet with blood, The care-worn peasant sat and Heav'n invok'd, Frantic, and gazing on his infant brood, With unavailing cries imploring food, And calling yet upon their mother's name: She heard not their lament; the soldier rude, Deaf to compassion's voice, her strength o'ercame, And bore her far away t'appease his brutal flame. XVII There, wildly wand'ring o'er the desert plain, Some weeping matron sought her lov'd child's corse, With outcries loud and exclamations vain: Or some sad widow mourn'd her soul's divorce; While, as dread tales they told of lawless force, Full many a maiden, trembling and forlorn, Of their regretted swains would hold discourse, Whom war remorseless from their arms had borne, And from their native shades and plighted vows had torn. XVIII The pitying King, partaking in their grief, Those ills, which human aid could reach, consol'd. But what to mental woe can bring relief? The pangs of nature cannot be controul'd; Nor pow'r's strong hand, nor all prevailing gold, The poison rankling in the heart can sheath: Still sensibility past scenes will mould, Where joy and fleeting pleasure wove their wreath, When yet unknown was care, unfelt the sting of death. XIX While Richard thus his painful march pursued, From their exalted seat th' Infernal Pair With double vengeance fir'd his progress view'd. “Is it for this, that with unceasing care,” Satan exclaim'd, “my engines I prepare? “Shall a weak mortal thus my plans defeat? “Has Hell no new devices to ensnare, “No potent stratagems, no strong deceit, “Which may subdue his soul, and my revenge complete? XX “Belial! the cause of France and Philip's fate, “Again at stake, our instant aid require. “Call forth thy utmost pow'rs: indulge thy hate: “Combine with me in Richard's soul t'inspire “The strong allurements of unchaste desire: “Goad him to lust and to unlicenc'd love: “Let him, the victim of unhallow'd fire, “To virtue lost, thro' pleasure's mazes rove, “'Till angels weep his fall, and Hell triumphant prove!” XXI Thus saying, thro' the air his wings he spread, And trac'd his baleful flight: him follow'd near Belial, not less intent on errand dread. Far 'neath them flow'd Rapaume, whose waters clear A grateful tribute to Seine's current bear: Skirting it's lake's green marge Maromme they saw, And Roumare's far-extended forest, where Rollo made known the terrors of his law, And fill'd the savage tribes with reverential awe. XXII Thither the Fiends their vengeful progress bent. Swift as the solar ray the void they pass'd, And o'er the far-spread shade with dire intent Their flight arrested. Thro' it's coverts vast Satan with joy malign his keen glance cast: “Here, where yon glade the mingling boughs o'er-arch,” He cried, “my pow'r shall Richard's glories blast: “Let heat oppress, let thirst his legions parch, “And force him to suspend awhile his toilsome march.” XXIII He said, and thrice he wav'd his hand on high. Forthwith the south with murky clouds was bound, Which, rapidly ascending thro' the sky, The wide meridian with their veil embrown'd. Thunders at distance broke with sullen sound, And, as if forc'd by sympathetic sway, With short and quick concussions shook the ground: The sun obscur'd no longer shot his ray; All nature seem'd convuls'd and torpid with dismay. XXIV As o'er the plain advanc'd the English host, Appall'd the strange transition they beheld, And gaz'd upon the scene in wonder lost. When, lo! around them hollow murmurs swell'd: A vapour dense and hot, with speed unquell'd And pois'nous range, across the champaign came. As rolling on it's baleful course it held, The plants and herbage dry and black became, Crackling beneath their feet as if consum'd by flame. XXV As from a furnace the ignited steam Bursts, so infernal influence to dispense Amid their ranks rush'd on the noxious stream. Against it's subtlety and pow'r intense Nor helm nor cuirass could afford defence: The spring elastic of the air was fled; That active principle, that lively sense, By Providence o'er all creation spread For wond'rous purposes, now seem'd effete and dead. XXVI The warriors bow'd beneath its pow'r accurs'd; Fainting they stagger'd, while from ev'ry pore Unnat'ral floods of perspiration burst: Their fibres, suddenly relax'd, no more Th' o'erwhelming burthen of their armour bore. Nor less their minds subdued the vapour dank: Each visage marks of strong dejection wore; No longer now observant of their rank, They wander'd o'er the plain, or on the scorch'd turf sank. XXVII Nor less the King annoy'd the noxious blast: But native courage him with force supplied; Throughout the host he resolutely pass'd, And, as to raise their drooping hearts he tried, He pointed out to them the covert wide, Where shelter and fresh riv'lets they might find. Some were to action rous'd; while others sigh'd, And listlessly upon the ground reclin'd, As if to reason deaf, or to their fate resign'd. XXVIII His arguments, oft urg'd, prevail'd at length: T'advance with languid efforts they essay'd, Tho' for exertion scarce suffic'd their strength. As the deep wood more nearly they survey'd, It seem'd as if, amid th' impervious shade, Zephyr the undulating branches caught, And with their gently-waving foliage play'd; Now, softly swelling, to their sense he brought Short, interrupted gales, with sweets reviving fraught. XXIX Their faculties the balmy coolness cheer'd, And gave them force their efforts to renew. The friendly forest soon at hand appear'd: More freely now the breeze inspiring blew, And, as o'er flow'rets deck'd with many a hue It swept, their mingling fragrancy it stole, And from their honied cups rich odours drew, Of pow'r the venom'd influence to controul, Which in dominion strange had bound each warrior's soul. XXX “Hither, my lov'd companions!” Richard cried, “Beneath these friendly oaks, whose boughs disclose “An ample canopy, and, circling wide “Their moss-grown arms, invite you to repose, “Awhile the mem'ry of your suff'rings lose. “Here, to recruit your wasted strength, remain, “While yet the air with heat portentous glows: “Perhaps, when beams the ev'ning star, again “Your limbs from toil refresh'd new travel may sustain.” XXXI The warriors, as their Monarch spake, in haste Ent'ring the wood, each avenue around And ev'ry path in search of water trac'd. Ere long, attracted by its murm'ring sound, With verdant hart's-tongue fring'd a stream they found: Stretch'd on its banks they drank potations deep; Then, as their helms and morions they unbound, Some their provisions spread, while some in sleep, More grateful from fatigue, their senses sought to steep. XXXII While thus, as chance prescrib'd, at ease they lay, Richard, whose spirit dull inaction slighted, Amid the wood's recess preferr'd to stray. It's varied charms his raptur'd eye invited; The gently-quiv'ring leaves and boughs were lighted By the gay sun-beam; while the mass between, A stranger to it's ray, seem'd half-benighted; Yet, as the breeze prevail'd, throughout were seen In rich gradation tints of vivid brown and green. XXXIII With flow'rs enamell'd, and with moss besprent, Unnumber'd paths, which nature's hand had clear'd, On ev'ry side their course romantic bent, O'ercanopied with oaks, whose trunks high-rear'd The produce huge of centuries appear'd, With misletoe and hoary lichens hung: While, as their flight with sportive wings they steer'd, Thousands of birds their am'rous descants sung, 'Till with their lively strains the forest's circuit rung. XXXIV Richard delighted view'd the placid scene: Congenial calmness o'er his bosom stole; A sudden influence, potent tho' serene, Prevail'd his warring passions to controul, And harmonize insensibly his soul. With careless pace he wander'd 'mid the shade, A path pursuing, which across a knoll Seem'd to conduct him tow'rds a verdant glade, By the surrounding gloom more gay and tempting made. XXXV As on he went, beauties, before unknown, Combin'd his raptur'd senses to surprize. O'er the smooth turf, irregularly thrown, Fantastic beeches of enormous size, Forming a circle vast, were seen to rise: Each, as it rear'd aloft it's ample head, Ting'd with brown Autumn's richly-pencil'd dyes, On ev'ry side it's massy branches spread, And o'er the vault immense a solemn stillness shed. XXXVI Beneath their high-thrown arch more freely grew The variegated store, which nature gay Around with elegant luxuriance threw, As if intent her treasures to array: While, as the flitting gale in wanton play Swept o'er their waving tops, the sun illum'd The modest lawn, and glanc'd his golden ray: Then new-born fragrancy the air perfum'd, More fresh the herbage sprang, more sweet the flow'rets bloom'd. XXXVII Close by them flow'd a softly-murm'ring brook, Where, 'mid the current which translucent roll'd, It's scaly brood their harmless pastime took. There the swift-gliding trout rejoic'd t'unfold His bright red circlets and his scales of gold; The perch his scarlet fins and silv'ry side Disclos'd, while, with dominion uncontroul'd, The lordly pike, dread monarch of the tide, O'er subject tribes was seen unrivall'd to preside. XXXVIII There water-lilies their sweet odour spread, And, from it's sword-like leaves of brightest green, The gaudy iris rear'd it's yellow head. Skirting each bank, the poplar tall was seen, Alders, and willows, which prefer to lean, And kiss the waves which round their moist roots wind. To perfect the enchantments of the scene, The rose and eglantine their scents combin'd, And high it's graceful wreaths the clematis entwin'd. XXXIX “Oh nature! fairest in retirement shewn,” He cried, “when thus, by grandeur unoppress'd, “I view thy charms, and hail them all thine own, “When thy chaste loveliness is thus confess'd, “To Heav'n my soul ascends, my conscious breast “With rev'rence tow'rds the Pow'r transcendent glows, “Whose hand with beauties has creation dress'd, “Whose bounty in a stream exhaustless flows “On all that walk the earth, on ev'ry flow'r that blows. XL “Here, amid shades conceal'd from mortal eye, “While round me breezes charg'd with perfumes sweep, “And birds their sweet strains carol, let me lie. “I feel a soft and gentle influence creep “O'er my exhausted frame. Come, balmy Sleep! “Whom oft in vain the care-worn monarch sues, “My languid senses in oblivion steep. “Let me my toils awhile in slumber lose, “Nor to my wearied soul thy genial aid refuse.” XLI Gently he sank, and, on th' enamell'd ground Out-stretch'd, he lost the mem'ry of his care: For more than natural sway his forces bound. Him over-shadowing, the infuriate pair Survey'd malignly, as they wrought their snare, The last dread effort of their vengeance fell. Charg'd with contagion was the troubled air, Now saturated by the potent spell, Devis'd by ruthless pow'r, and cull'd from deepest Hell. XLII “The hour approaches,” Satan sternly cried, “When his o'erthrow, who long has spurn'd our sway, “Our contest and our triumph shall decide. “Summon the spirits who our word obey; “With them thy practis'd artifice display, “Temptations strong and novel to produce, “Which may our victim's constancy betray; “While in his soul strange poisons I infuse, “His fancy to inflame, his senses to abuse.” XLIII Belial exulting heard his dire command: With savage joy and hellish transport fraught, From their sulphureous caves he call'd his band. Him with obedient wing the Dæmons sought; Aw'd by his word, by his example taught, They urg'd the duties which their Chief impos'd, And to compleat the charm of mischief wrought; While Richard, still his eyes in slumber clos'd, Unconscious of their arts and plans malign, repos'd. XLIV As when a Vampyre, hot for human blood, Pierces with sharpen'd tongue the turgid vein Of some deep-sleeping wretch, the vital flood With suction strong he perseveres to drain, And o'er him, to obtund the sense of pain, Unceasingly his leathern pinions plies; Doom'd ne'er to view the light of Heav'n again, His victim more and more exhausted lies, Dreams out his ebbing life, and unresisting dies: XLV So his broad wings the Prince of Darkness spread O'er England's King, but with intent more foul: He sought not only by enchantments dread And spells accurs'd his body to controul, But to subdue and brutalize his soul, And blast his glories with eternal shame. As wav'd his plumes, his potent influence stole Like fire electric thro' the Monarch's frame, And to his heart propell'd a penetrating flame. XLVI Soon the contagion to prevail began: For now, the poisons, which the Fiend infus'd, With force resistless thro' his arteries ran. Visions, whose airy forms the soul abus'd, Like those by fever's madd'ning heat produc'd, In quick succession skimm'd across his brain, And with display fantastical amus'd: Spectres of shape uncouth, chimæras vain, Now breathing fond delight, and now foreboding pain. XLVII But as, when morning re-assumes her sway, The mantling fog, engender'd by the night, Before the sun's new splendour fades away, Down from the mountains roll it's volumes white, And the gay vallies, now restor'd to light, Their dew-dropt meads and foliage rich disclose; So fled these phantasms from his mental sight, And scenes more definitely trac'd arose, On his deluded sense adapted to impose. XLVIII It's ample walls a stately palace rear'd, Whose columns huge, rang'd in confusion bold, And from Carrara's boasted quarries clear'd, With shafts majestic rose the roof t' uphold, Which, trimly fretted, and adorn'd with gold, Spread to the day, and with it's radiance beam'd. It's windows arching high, of Gothic mould, Fantastically deck'd with paintings seem'd, Stain'd with whose magic dyes the light attemper'd stream'd. XLIX As o'er the vaulted hall it's gay tints burst, Fresh brilliancy from sparkling gems they drew, Which o'er the spacious chamber were dispers'd: The purple amethyst, the sapphire blue, The blood-red ruby, opals ever new, The yellow topaz, and the emerald green, Pale beryls, hyacinths of fiery hue, The diamond of the mineral kingdom queen, All in profusion heap'd and splendid pomp were seen. L On either side, and at the upper end, In long array dispos'd, were tables plac'd, With varied luxuries that appear'd to bend. There ev'ry tempting viand might be trac'd, To rouse dull appetite and charm the taste: Pomona there her luscious produce strew'd, There Flora with her gifts the banquet grac'd, While from vast tuns the juice of Bacchus flow'd, And perfumes rich exhal'd as in the cup it glow'd. LI On couches rich, along the spacious board, Sat many a lovely dame and lusty knight, Carousing on the cates which there were stor'd: These their fair partners earnest seem'd t' invite, Their amorous suit and service to requite With full possession of their blooming charms; While smiling they appear'd their vows to slight, Yet oft, t' appease their idly rais'd alarms, Forgot their coyness feign'd, and sank into their arms. LII Minstrels unseen enchanting notes awoke, And from their harps, with chords of silver strung, Sounds which might apathy itself provoke, In wild and mingled modulation wrung. Suspended now the melting cadence hung, Now, bursting into diapason sweet, The vault with harmonies ecstatic rung, While heav'nly voices would the song repeat, And swell their rapt'rous strains the chorus to compleat. LIII Now lovelier symphonies were heard around. A group of wanton nymphs was seen advancing: Light as the air they bounded o'er the ground, By half concealment now their charms enhancing, Now thro' their blushes smiles insidious glancing, Which spoke impassion'd heat and fierce desire; Then beams voluptuous from their full eyes lancing, Their polish'd limbs entwining, to inspire Visions of mad delight and dreams of lustful fire. LIV Richard inflam'd the tempting scene beheld, For reason now her sway no longer kept; High beat his pulse, his veins with transport swell'd, And o'er his heart a flood of passion swept. Tow'rds the gay throng impatiently he leap'd, When, lo! the Nymph, who seem'd to lead the rest, Beaming angelic beauties, forward stept: She gaz'd, she blush'd, and, while her eyes confess'd Ecstatic joy, she caught the Monarch to her breast. LV Her touch his soul with kindred ardour fill'd, Through all his frame the subtle influence flew, And ev'ry nerve with madd'ning fury thrill'd. As round her yielding form his arms he threw, Charms unexpected met his eager view: With drifted snow her skin appear'd to vie, Her panting bosom heav'd with impulse new, With double lustre shone her moisten'd eye, And all Arabia's sweets were wafted in a sigh. LVI Entranc'd he seem'd amidst a world of blisses; Closer he held her in his warm embrace, And ravish'd from her lips ambrosial kisses: Now, bolder grown, his eye essay'd to trace Her soft form modell'd by the touch of grace, Which scarcely her transparent vestment hid; While she, with glowing and averted face, In broken accents his presumption chid, Yet seem'd dispos'd to share what still her tongue forbid. LVII Sudden she burst from his encircling arms, And, while a smile which might recal the dead Play'd on her mouth and heighten'd all her charms, She left the group, who with fantastic tread Unwearied yet their wanton measures led, And down the hall her agile footsteps bent. He follow'd as the fair enchantress fled, Who, turning oft, impassion'd glances sent, Expressive of her flame, and mutely eloquent. LVIII Not the light gossamer more swiftly skims Thro' yielding æther when the fresh breeze blows, Than mov'd the fair one: from her polish'd limbs, As if successive beauties to disclose, Caught by the gale her loose robe oft arose, And widely spread, as if it scorn'd to shield Charms which might well on mortal sense impose: These as with practis'd coyness she conceal'd, Treasures more tempting still her erring hand reveal'd. LIX Thro' the expanding portals now she flew, And 'cross a path with softest moss array'd Nimbly advanc'd, 'till tow'rds a wood she drew, Where, as they form'd a deep impervious shade, The forest's tenants far their boughs display'd; While, 'mid their knotty trunks with ivy deck'd, With varied course branch'd off full many a glade, Some their straight course preferring to direct, Some tempting the pleas'd eye their wand'rings to inspect. LX She hesitated not, but chusing one Which far within the wood appear'd to wind, Gaily tripp'd on; yet seem'd she not to shun The ardent King, who follow'd close behind: Oft look'd she back with smiles, as if inclin'd, Within the dark recesses of the grove, Some covert from intrusion free to find, Which to warm passion might auspicious prove, And where congenial hearts might sacrifice to love. LXI Nor sought she long in vain. Of purest green A turfy couch appear'd, with flow'rets strew'd, O'er which, high arching, beeches tall were seen; As mantling thick their waving branches shew'd, With the sun's mild departing tints they glow'd: Near them, meand'ring o'er it's pebbly bed, And gently murm'ring, a clear riv'let flow'd; Melodious birds in amorous circles sped, And o'er th' enchanting scene contagious softness shed. LXII Richard amaz'd the well-known spot beheld, Where lately, spent by toil, he courted rest: But other objects his fond soul impell'd: The tempting fair one who inflam'd his breast Now vanquish'd seem'd; by lassitude oppress'd, Sinking to earth, her swift career she stay'd; Panting she lay; with her disorder'd vest As if enamour'd Zephyr loosely play'd, While beauties yet unseen his wanton touch betray'd. LXIII “She's mine! She's mine!” th' enraptur'd monarch cried, And, while his heart beat high with new alarms, He knelt o'ercome with transport by her side, And, as he fondly press'd her in his arms, Confess'd the full dominion of her charms. She with feign'd coyness, as his suit advanc'd, Seem'd faintly deprecating fancied harms; Blushes and tears her loveliness enhanc'd, 'Till trembling on the sod she fell as if entranc'd. LXIV Meantime, while Satan thus his purpose dread With persevering energy had wrought, And o'er his victim's soul his toils had spread, His active ministers, by Belial taught, Their subtle spell had to perfection brought. “Behold!” he cried, “o'er his subjected frame “Our arts prevail: be now the moment caught, “When in his waking heart th' unhallow'd flame “May reign with fatal power, and eternize his shame.” LXV As when, engender'd by the falling dew, The gaudy rainbow o'er heav'n's face ascends, In quick succession, purple, violet, blue, Green, yellow, orange, red, it gaily blends; Distinctly each a separate arch extends, Yet, so combin'd their outlines, none can tell Where one begins, and where another ends: So, imperceptibly, the potent spell Prevail'd from Richard's sense sleep's empire to dispel. LXVI Unconscious of the rapid change he seem'd; With instantaneous energy his soul From supernat'ral slumber was redeem'd: Yet did the Fiend his faculties controul With such strange sway, that the transition stole Unheeded and unfelt; the vision ran Into his waking thoughts, and form'd a whole So just, that recollection fail'd to scan Where fiction ceas'd, or where reality began. LXVII The same in ev'ry point appear'd the scene: Still, in attractive loveliness array'd, The turf and verdant canopy were seen; Still, as it darted thro' the mantling shade, The sun's mild lustre with the foliage play'd; Still flow'd the riv'let; still the sweet birds sung; Still by his side the fainting Nymph was laid; Still gaz'd he on her charms, and on his tongue Unfinish'd ecstacies and vows of transport hung. LXVIII The ready Nymph the favouring moment took: Op'ning her eyes which passion strong confess'd, While her soft frame with agitation shook, She caught him in her arms, and closely press'd Th' enamour'd Monarch to her panting breast. “Victor alike,” she cried, “in war and love, “Nought should thy promis'd triumph now arrest, “Would'st thou but one fond, tender, doubt remove. “Wilt thou be truly mine? Ah! wilt thou constant prove?” LXIX “Treat not so lightly thy resistless charms,” Replied he; “pleasure dances in thine eye, “And Paradise is centred in thine arms! “Increase of joy possession will supply; “Our vig'rous love shall time itself defy, “And fresh attractions shall inhance our bliss! “Then, matchless Nymph! no more my suit deny! “Thus I adjure thee by this burning kiss “To crown my ardent hopes, and all thy fears dismiss!” LXX She, while deep blushes mantled on her cheek, And heav'd with wild delight her bosom fair, As if unable for a while to speak, Gaz'd on him: then with an impassion'd air She cried, “Thus let me my resolve declare: “Tell me but once that thou art wholly mine, “That none with me thy constant heart shall share; “To ev'ry other love thy faith resign, “Then I and all my charms shall be for ever thine.” LXXI A strange emotion o'er his bosom pass'd. The Nymph, who fail'd not it's access to trace, Again her snow-white arms around him cast, And, summoning each smile and winning grace, With new endearments in her warm embrace Him, half reluctant, half o'ercome, she held. Ungovern'd transport now illum'd her face, Beam'd in her eyes, high in her bosom swell'd, And thro' her trembling frame the quicken'd blood impell'd. LXXII “Now,” she exclaim'd, “when all to love invites, “When none with eye prophane presume t'invade “This shelter consecrated to delights, “Say why, my hero! are our joys delay'd? “Mark how the sportive songsters of the glade “Nature's blest law with ecstasy pursue: “By them her first, best, mandate is obey'd; “Fruition still unsated they renew, “As if increas'd desires from full enjoyment grew. LXXIII “See, how thro' all creation's ample verge, “On earth's green face, 'midst ocean's depths profound, “All feel the impulse, all the duty urge. “By this kind nature's great behest is crown'd: “Earth, water, air, with tenderness resound; “The tow'ring woods, the widely-arching groves, “Each gaudy flow'ret that adorns the ground, “Confess her sway; each bliss appropriate proves, “And shedding perfumes breathes it's aromatic loves. LXXIV “Why then should we our happiness retard, “Since, of superior faculties possess'd, “More perfect joys our passion will reward? “Thus let me hold thee to my throbbing breast! “Thus let my vows be on thy lips confess'd! “Thus, while our souls in mingling transports join, “With burning sighs pronounce the valued test; “Tell me but once all others you resign, “Swear that yourself, your soul, shall be for ever mine!” LXXV “Myself! my soul!” the King confus'd replied, “This and it's inmost thoughts to Heav'n belong, “That claims exclusively my lovely bride. “I may not both at once so foully wrong! “Mov'd by some potency, unknown tho' strong, “Have stoop'd my captive senses to thy lure. “Strange and confus'd ideas o'er me throng: “Sure Hell itself, my passions to allure, “O'er my unguarded soul has spread it's charms impure!” LXXVI “And dost thou then my proffer'd love disdain?” Exclaim'd the Nymph: “Is my poor feeling heart “On apathy like thine bestow'd in vain? “Ah! let me to some shade remote depart, “Rack'd by despair, and tortur'd by the smart “Of scorn'd endearments and of slighted charms! “What! at a pledge of constancy to start, “When fond desire thy youthful bosom warms, “When willing beauty sues, and clasps thee in her arms!” LXXVII “Ah cease!” he cried, “fond Nymph! the heart t'upbraid, “Which thy fair image too distinctly bears: “The cloud, which darkly o'er my fancy play'd, “Whate'er th' illusion may have caus'd, now clears, “And, tho' with range uncertain, doubts and fears “Contend for empire and distract my mind. “Ah! look not so! drop not those pearly tears “Hide those perfections, lest, to duty blind, ‘Again my working soul to madness be resign'd!’ LXXVIII “Alas! how can I tears of anguish hide! “Can I, when breaks my throbbing heart with pain, “Command my smiles?” she tenderly replied. “Bid angry ocean his wild waves restrain, “Bid joy the minutes of delight retain, “Or grief annihilate the gloomy hour, “But bid not me felicity regain! “Consuming flames my suff'ring breast devour, “I die the slave of love, of thy unpitying pow'r!” LXXIX She said, and fainting sank: his fervent soul Desire and opportunity impell'd, And o'er his sense again wild passion stole: Embrac'd the yielding fair one yet he held, Still flush'd her cheeks, her panting bosom swell'd; But tho' he still her loveliness could prize, No longer his impetuous will rebell'd. She, conscious of the change, her moisten'd eyes Rais'd, and around her look'd with well-assum'd surprize. LXXX “Truant to love!” she cried, “whose fancies weak “With his imperious dictates interfere, “Joys more adapted to thy cold heart seek! “Ah! leave me, thou ingrate! to drop the tear, “While for thy sake, still to my mem'ry dear, “In silent grief I waste my virgin bloom; “While the sad willow on my brow I wear, “And, seeking some remote congenial gloom, “Invoke propitious death, and court an early tomb. LXXXI “Adieu! too well belov'd, too faithless youth! “Soon all memorial shall thy mind dismiss “Of transient passion and oft-plighted truth. Farewell! but take with thee this parting kiss: “By this fond pledge of love, by this, and this, “Myself, my charms, I consecrate as thine. “Oh! that while thus our souls are bath'd in bliss, “While thus in mutual transport we entwine, “Congenial whispers might proclaim thee wholly mine!” LXXXII Thus saying, to her wildly throbbing breast, Which rose as if convuls'd with amorous pain, With grasp ecstatic she the Monarch press'd. A kindling ardour rush'd thro' ev'ry vein, Panting he gaz'd, scarce able to sustain The soft impressions which his heart assail'd. But faith and duty soon resum'd their reign: He paus'd, he sigh'd, as reason's pow'r unveil'd The artifice refin'd which o'er his soul prevail'd. LXXXIII Yet still his wand'ring senses seem'd enchain'd, Virtue and vice in doubtful balance hung; Now yielded he, now firmness he regain'd, While round him she with warm caresses clung; When, suddenly, the forest's precincts rung With cries of mirth and music's gladsome sound; Gay melodies enliv'ning voices sung, And thro' the verdant glade with nimble bound The dancing group advanc'd, and weav'd their mazy round. LXXXIV Industriously they fram'd their agile measure, While from their eyes, than sparkling gems more bright, Flash'd wanton passion and tumultuous pleasure. At ev'ry turn, their vestments loose and light, Caught by the flitting gale, reveal'd to sight Beauties, which well the fancy might inspire With transport, and tumultuous hopes excite: Now seem'd they urg'd by love's imperious fire, Now lost in ecstacies voluptuous to expire. LXXXV “See where the amorous pair recline,” they cried; “With bliss transported, and untir'd by love, “Themselves from mortal view they seek to hide. “Hither we come your pleasures to improve, “With us thro' all the windings of the grove, “Besprent with moss, by perfum'd breezes fann'd, “To nature's laws obedient, gaily rove; “Hark to our cheerful call, and hand in hand “Follow the merry pipe, and join our festive band.” LXXXVI Thus saying, wreaths of every scent and hue, Arrang'd with varied and fantastic taste, O'er the astonish'd King they lightly threw. A myrtle chaplet on his head they plac'd, While the fond Nymph a crown of roses grac'd, Red as the blushes which her cheeks o'erspread. More deep these grew as she the Prince embrac'd: But rapidly the soft suffusion fled, As struggling to escape her circling arms he said: LXXXVII “No! tho' more potent are thy matchless charms “Than all which human beauty can display, “Tho' mad temptation revel in thine arms, “I must not, cannot, thy command obey. “Love, wedded Love, asserts his rightful sway: “Vows of recorded truth from Heav'n above “Speak to my soul, and summon me away; “They bid me quit this fascinating grove, “And fly the haunts impure of prostituted love!” LXXXVIII He said, and springing from her clasp essay'd To trace the path which wound within the wood. But soon the minstrel group his footsteps stay'd; Again their wanton movements they pursued, Their frontless arts and blandishments renew'd, And, unrestrain'd by fear and unasham'd, Chanted in notes obscene their orgies lewd; Their eye-balls roll'd, by passion's force inflam'd The fire, which rag'd within, their burning cheeks proclaim'd. LXXXIX Where'er he turn'd, they circled round him close, New gestures framing, while their impious din And lawless mirth in louder chorus rose. “Think not,” he cried, “that these disguisements thin “To deeds of guilt my constant heart can win. “If specious modesty has fail'd to gain “My raptur'd soul, and urge me on to sin, “Lewdness profess'd attempts the task in vain: “Her flimsy toils I spurn with horror and disdain. XC “Cease base seducers! cease; against your art “By truth and virtue is my firm mind steel'd. “If ye be human, hence, far hence depart; “But, in those forms if Dæmons be conceal'd, “Guard me, ye Saints! ye succouring Angels shield! “Great Ruler of the world! thy suppliant hear; “Strip their false semblance, let them stand reveal'd: “Tho' rob'd in all their terrors they appear, “Arm'd with thy faith my soul can never yield to fear!” XCI Thus spake the pious Monarch: nor in vain To heav'n's tribunal rose his fervent pray'r. Still'd were the clamours of the boist'rous train: Loud thunders burst, and the pale light'ning's glare Shot thro' the murky and distemper'd air: Clouds tempest-driv'n the face of day o'ercast; Shrill cries were heard of anguish and despair; Earth trembling shook throughout her caverns vast, And nature seem'd to bend before th' o'erwhelming blast. XCII As, on the mimic stage, an audience sees The gay machines and pictur'd scen'ry rise, While houses, landscapes, palaces and trees, Lost in confusion vanish from their eyes; So, rapt in awe, and stiffen'd with surprise, The wide convulsion England's King survey'd: The beechen grove, the flow'rs of various dyes, The riv'let clear, the bank with moss array'd, Seem'd from his view to shrink and suddenly to fade. XCIII The rugged forest, now disguis'd no more, Illumin'd shone with gleams of fiery red: Amongst it's boughs the wind, with sullen roar Rushing amain, it's devastation spread; Before it's rage the oak's high-branching head, Yielding, with fragments huge bestrew'd the plain; While, as if bound by supernat'ral dread, And motionless, the lately sportive train Proclaim'd with fearful screams their agonizing pain. XCIV Them as he view'd the Monarch loudly cried: “By His eternal and transcendent name, “Who, tow'rds His throne His chosen flock to guide, “A meek partaker of man's state became, “These borrow'd forms relinquish! Stampt with shame, “Hence to your dark infernal caves repair! “There amid kindred glooms and racking flame, “For endless ages testimony bear, “That man, by virtue grac'd, is heav'n's peculiar care.” XCV Thus in commanding accents spake the King. The Fiends, abash'd and wildly-shudd'ring, heard His invocation dread. With out-stretch'd wing Their bulk horrific as aloft they rear'd, Unmask'd their full deformity appear'd. Nor less obedient to the high behest His course obscene amid them Belial steer'd: No more a Nymph the flow'ry couch he press'd, But rob'd in hell's array a Dæmon stood confess'd. XCVI As thro' the troubled atmosphere they pass'd, On the triumphant King of fell despite And baffled hate their glances stern they cast, While 'mid their ranks, shrouded in blackest night, His form still undisclos'd to mortal sight, Pre-eminence imperial Satan claim'd. Aw'd by superior pow'r, he check'd their flight, And, as his breast with struggling passions flam'd, With voice like thunder thus tremendously exclaim'd. XCVII “To combat heav'n's high will in Me no force, “No pow'rs in Me, tho' Arch-angelic, dwell; “But, vanquish'd by thy constancy, my course, “Dishonour'd and o'ercome, I bend tow'rds hell. “Thy matchless worth shall England's foes repel: “Fortune shall now her former wrongs redress; “No more shall Dæmons frame their potent spell, “And urge their toils thy virtue to oppress. “Lasting renown is thine, and well-deserv'd success.” XCVIII He said; and mounting high athwart the gloom, While o'er the sky with coruscation foul Red meteors glanc'd, he wav'd his sounding plume, Attended by his crew, whose piercing howl And shrieks appalling spoke his strong controul. Richard beheld them pass: in wonder lost He pour'd in fervent pray'r his raptur'd soul, Then, with new ardour fill'd, the forest cross'd, And joyful sought the spot where yet repos'd his host. END OF BOOK XV. BOOK XVI. ARGUMENT.

I Beneath the western wave repos'd the sun, When from the forest, late th' eventful scene Of spells accurs'd, Richard his march begun. Passing Varengeville and it's precincts green, They cross'd the gentle and meand'ring Ene, Which, from Pavilli gliding, near Duclair Pays it's clear tribute to the princely Seine. Thence, thro' extending plains and vallies fair, With vig'rous steps they aim'd to reach La Forestiere. II Her chastest beauties round them to disclose Nature industrious seem'd. It was a night, When all creation courted soft repose, When the rapt poet's soul might wing it's flight To realms of bliss and regions of delight. Not calmer was the hour, when Hero stood And wav'd her flaming torch from Sestos' height, While bold Leander plough'd the billows rude, And for her love disdain'd the Hellespontic flood. III Still tinted were the western Heav'ns with red, Glowing, tho' soft; which, by gradations due Melting, a gleam of solemn lustre shed O'er the first tinge of empyrean blue. As from it's verge th' ascending arch withdrew, The firmament with deeper azure glow'd; Throughout, their destin'd orbits to pursue, Innum'rous stars and planets bright were strew'd, While 'midst her dazzling train the moon majestic rode. IV Her temper'd radiance far around she shed. While many a wood, impervious to her ray, Obscurely shrouded rear'd it's waving head, O'er the far-spreading plains her beams would stray, On the still lake would undulating play, Or with mild touch some rippling stream would gild. No sounds were heard, save where the owl her way Whooting pursued, or Philomela thrill'd Her soul-inspiring song, and melody distill'd. V By night advancing, halting in the day, Yet always by their King's attention cheer'd, O'er the Caletian field their toilsome way With steady course the gallant warriors steer'd. Inspir'd by thirst of fame they persever'd Unceasingly their duty to fulfil, 'Till, on the second morn, the sun appear'd, Scatt'ring his beams across the vine-clad hill, Which skirted with its base the plain where stood Foville. VI Here, to recruit their strength, awhile they stay'd: But soon, as high their breasts with ardour swell'd T' assert the cause of innocence betray'd, Their progress with redoubled zeal they held. Not far had they advanc'd, when they beheld A goodly troop, which o'er the distant plain, As if on speed intent, it's route impell'd: Their vig'rous coursers seem'd to spurn the rein, And o'er the dusty field came pouring on amain. VII Ere long, superbly waving in the gale, The English Red-Cross banner they espied: Surmounting Gallia's flag and lilies pale, It wanton'd in the breeze with lordly pride. The well-arm'd Knight, who seem'd the host to guide, A charger huge of Frieseland breed bestrode, Whose hoofs afar resounded: by his side, In converse close a graceful damsel rode, While loose her veil and robes of snowy whiteness flow'd. VIII Approaching nearer, with a sudden spring Their leader leap'd to earth: with bended knee He paid obeisance to the martial King, Presenting to his hand a massive key. “From Fecan's gates, again from thraldom free, “This pledge accept,” he cried; “her walls confess “Thy rightful sway, and wait thy high decree. “Heav'n and it's Saints have deign'd our toils to bless, “And grac'd our righteous cause with merited success.” IX “My best-belov'd Blondel!” the Prince rejoin'd, “The pow'rs immortal, which the brave defend, “Have led thee on, and in thy cause combin'd. “Hither we came our succour prompt to lend, “And from impending harm to save my friend: “But thy exertions have out-stript our speed. “Say, by what wond'rous means, ere yet descend “The fourth day's shadows, hast thou wrought a deed, “Which fixes on thy brow fame's ever-blooming meed?” X “Honour and Love,” the youthful hero cried, “Combin'd with Loyalty my arm have brac'd, “And Providence my efforts deign'd to guide. “Thus fortified, my vent'rous course I trac'd, “Brav'd the wild sea, embattled legions fac'd, “And sav'd yon peerless maid from threat'ning fate. “Triumphs more ample yet my toils have grac'd: “Here, in your presence, stands the Prince ingrate, “T'abide his Sov'reign's will, his censure to await.” XI Him interrupting, thus the King exclaim'd. “Awhile th' eventful narrative suspend: “With him, whose arts 'gainst England's welfare aim'd, “Whose vaulting hope made him from duty bend, “And all the sacred bonds of kindred rend, “It first behoves to speak. Awhile retire, “And bid your troop at distance due attend: “Whate'er contempt his conduct may inspire, “The semblance of respect a Brother's claims require.” XII The warlike band delay'd not to retreat, While, with an air which inward grief express'd, Richard advanc'd the captive Prince to meet. Silent he stood, awaiting his behest; Downcast his eyes; his arms across his breast Folded dejectedly; by shame and fear, Mark'd strongly on his varying cheek, depress'd: As if tormented by reflections drear, He sigh'd, and trickling fell from either eye a tear. XIII As struggling passions in his breast awoke, Richard, regarding him with fix'd disdain And temper'd firmness, thus the Prince bespoke. “If thou hast feelings, do they not arraign “And sting thy soul, that thus we meet again! “That thus in arms and menacing array, “Meanly enroll'd in perjur'd Philip's train, “Thou dar'st his impious standard to display, “And league with him thy King and country to betray? XIV “My Brother!—Does not thy degenerate heart, “When thus my lips pronounce the once-lov'd name, “With agonizing recollections smart? “Does not thy conscience at it's sound proclaim “Thy frontless treasons and recorded shame? “Unworthy offspring of our royal line! “Could not the memory of our father's fame “The impulse check, which led thee France to join, “And 'gainst thy ligeance sworn with traitors to combine? XV “Ere yet, seduc'd by their insidious plan, “Rebellion's lure thy gratitude betray'd, “My bounty thy ambitious hopes outran: “Seven Earldoms thy supreme command obey'd; “Thy banners on eight castles were display'd, “Whose territories form'd thy rich domain; “To thee a gen'rous people rev'rence paid. “Did I in ought thy grasping hopes restrain? “Say, was to Richard e'er prefer'd thy suit in vain? XVI “Yet could not these thy grasping soul content. “When our great cause had summon'd me away. “When England by domestic ills was rent, “When I, to Henry's tyranny a prey, “Within the tow'rs of dread Trivallis lay; “When honour, duty, and affection's voice “Bad you a zeal pre-eminent display, “Then were disgrace and infamy your choice, “Then could an English Prince in England's woes rejoice. XVII “Imagine not to gild with vain pretence “These aggravated wrongs: have not recourse “To arts which ill can gloss thy rank offence, “Lest thy weak artifice my soul should force “To purpose more severe. Prey to remorse, “From England exil'd, seek some distant coast, “Find, if thou can'st, from conscience some resource, “Implore forgiveness for thine impious boast, “And blush whene'er thou think'st on what thy crimes have lost!” XVIII As thus with mingled dignity and scorn The Monarch spoke, the Prince's heaving breast Seem'd with the war of struggling passions torn. Tears for a while his inward pangs confess'd, Then, falling at his feet, his knees he press'd; “Oh! deign a self-accusing wretch to spare, He cried, “Oh! deign his sentence to arrest! “Oh! let him strive his errors to repair, “But oh! condemn him not to exile and despair! XIX “How can I best my conscious guilt proclaim, “How my remorse and penitence define, “Or make a fit atonement for my shame? “Each secret of thy foe, each deep design, “Whisper'd in confidential trust, are mine; “His plans and all his purposes I know: “These, if thou deign'st to pardon, all are thine. “His failings and his weakness I can shew, “And well can I direct thy unexpected blow. XX “Shall I to thee his private haunts betray, “And thro' blind paths, by me well understood, “To his destruction shall I lead the way, “Where thy avenging sword may drink his blood, “And by one stroke hostilities conclude? “Oh! try me thus, but spare my cruel doom! “Pity these tears, be merciful and good! “Let me again my wonted state resume! “Think on our honour'd Sire, Oh! think on her whose womb—” XXI “No more!” exclaim'd th' indignant Monarch: “Cease “Thy fruitless tears and lamentation vain! “Thy recent guilt they serve but to increase. “Could he by fraud the Gallic kingdom gain, “Think not that Richard would his glory stain, “Or owe success to stratagems so base. “Tempt not to fury then my just disdain, “Nor, while thy deeds belie their gen'rous race, “Our parents' sacred names let thy false tongue disgrace. XXII “If, stampt with infamy, by all despis'd, “Life yet has charms, take it, and meanly live: “If poor distinctions still by thee are priz'd, “And vanity the sense of shame survive, “Still to maintain thy old precedence strive. “Small faith to thy professions I attach: “I know thee, John, and, while I thus forgive, “I mark thy working passions on the watch, “Offences fresh to frame, and treasons new to hatch. XXIII “But, tho' I know thee well, I fear thee not: “Tho', in my absence, from thy recreant soul “O'erweening hope prevail'd my rights to blot, “And urg'd thee on to deeds of import foul, “My presence shall thy enterprize controul. “Exist then, if thou wilt, of honour shorn; “Let pageantry for character console: “The object of a loyal nation's scorn, “Let thy despis'd estate succeeding traitors warn!” XXIV Thus with commanding air the Monarch said, And turning tow'rds the host, where brave Blondel At distance due with Chariclæa stay'd, With courteous phrase he urg'd the Chief to tell The chances which his vent'rous quest befel. “When thus,” he cried, “your fortunes you narrate, “Fear not on ev'ry circumstance to dwell: “My friend's renown, and Chariclæa's fate, “In ev'ry English heart strong int'rest must create.” XXV Hush'd was the croud, when thus commenc'd the Chief. ‘On that dread night, when from Normannia's Park ‘The Princess was convey'd, for her relief ‘With fifty knights I hasten'd to embark. ‘The moon with clouds was veil'd, the sky was dark, ‘No favouring planet shot its guiding ray; ‘Yet seem'd propitious winds t' impel our bark, ‘Which swiftly thro' Seine's waters cut it's way, ‘And ample progress made ere dawn'd approaching day. XXVI ‘As thus our course we held, in converse grave ‘Our time we pass'd, how best the peerless Maid ‘From her audacious ravishers to save. ‘Their various projects many a Chief display'd, ‘And many a plan and stratagem was laid, ‘Which still some obvious difficulties cross'd: ‘At length, brave Somerville, who nought had said, ‘But on whose judgment all our band repos'd, ‘Rose, and at my request his counsel thus disclos'd. XXVII “When bold Sir Gualter, from whose loins I boast “To trace my lineage, left his father's seat, “And join'd his vassals to the Norman host “Which prov'd it's worth by Harold's dire defeat, “He gain'd at Wichnovre a calm retreat. “But still regardful of his kindred's claim, “Them oft with kind remembrance would he greet, “And, when occasion suited, hither came, “More by fraternal love united than by name. XXVIII “The like observance he his offspring taught, “And they their children. Oft my rev'rend Sire, “With pious care and warm attachment fraught, “Has left his home, impell'd by strong desire “From pomp and courtly splendour to retire, “To view his ancestorial shades once more. “The same fond impulse seem'd my heart t' inspire: “With him I lov'd to trace our parent shore, “And all the scenes enhanc'd by absence to explore. XXIX “Once, as from Pevensey our accustom'd course “In a small bark tow'rds Honfleur we pursued, “An equinoctial storm with threat'ning force “Assail'd us suddenly: the billows rude “Wash'd o'er our deck, and with alarm renew'd “The wild wind as it roar'd around we heard. “Near us at length stern Fecan's cliffs we view'd, “Which ruggedly their beetling summits rear'd, “While o'er them tow'ring high her battlements appear'd. XXX “By fortune favour'd, with assiduous care “A refuge in the harbour we obtain'd. “There, our dismantled vessel to repair, “And to refresh our crew, to stay constrain'd, “Awhile within the fortress we remain'd. “Incessant tho' our toils, and brief the space, “Some knowledge of it's wide extent I gain'd, “And heedfully survey'd the wond'rous place, “Intent it's nat'ral strength and labour'd works to trace. XXXI “Wond'rous indeed it is, sublime, and dread. “An hundred fathoms from the sea in height, “The cliff tremendously exalts it's head: “Half-way the sea-birds, winging their swift flight, “Skim thro' the air, and mock the dazzled sight; “As he looks downwards from it's perilous verge, “The giddy sentinel in wild affright “Shudders, while, far beneath, the roaring surge “Breaks, and the tyrant waves the rocks embattled scourge. XXXII “Thus tow'rds the sea impregnably secur'd, “Tow'rds it's small river and th' adjacent land “The safety of the town is well assur'd. “On ev'ry side enormous ramparts stand, “High heave her mounds, her ditches wide expand, “Unnumber'd turrets menacing the sky, “Charg'd with machines, with vet'ran warriors mann'd, “In ev'ry quarter meet th' astonish'd eye, “And seem extrinsic force superbly to defy. XXXIII “Against such works, howe'er your valour known “May urge th' attempt, expect not to prevail. “True courage never is by rashness shewn: “Where order'd armies might in vain assail, “Our little band, howe'er resolv'd, must fail; “Unless indeed some means we could devise, “By which the cliff we might succeed to scale, “And to the ramparts unobserv'd might rise: “Then might our bold attack th' unheeding guard surprize.” XXXIV ‘As thus the Chieftain spoke, involv'd in thought ‘I weigh'd his words, and straight my working mind, ‘Ardent for fame, a bold idea caught. ‘Forthwith it's execution I assign'd ‘To Somerville, and bad him try to find ‘The means of ent'ring Fecan's guarded wall. ‘Bayntun with him his ready service join'd, ‘Whom, whatsoe'er of peril might befal, ‘I knew no toils could check, no perils could appal. XXXV ‘Without delay we sought the northern strand. ‘They, their commission eager to conclude, ‘Hasten'd near Bolbec's little stream to land, ‘And by Ilebonne their hardy route pursued. ‘Our purpos'd course we instantly renew'd. ‘As night commenc'd, bold Havre's point we pass'd, ‘And, with the rising sun, at distance view'd ‘Fecan's proud cliffs, soaring distinct and vast, ‘Which o'er the subject main their lengthen'd shadow cast. XXXVI ‘Low'ring our mast, at distance due we kept, ‘And, tow'rds a creek obscure our cautious way ‘Bending, our oars the ocean's surface swept. ‘There, while our bark secure from notice lay, ‘We pass'd impatiently the tedious day. ‘Alternately we labour'd and repos'd: ‘Anxious alike our ardour to display, ‘And by the project we had form'd engross'd, ‘We perfected our task ere yet the ev'ning clos'd. XXXVII ‘The sky was overcast: thick-mantling night ‘Spread o'er the firmament her murky veil; ‘No planet gleam'd; no star with friendly light ‘It's face adorn'd: sometimes, before the gale ‘Propell'd, the clouds with swifter course would sail, ‘And momentary chasms of void space leave, ‘Thro' which the moon, with beams subdued and pale ‘Glancing, the waves allow'd us to perceive, ‘Which round the rocky base seem'd sullenly to heave. XXXVIII ‘The gloom, congenial to our views, we hail'd. ‘Quitting our friendly creek, along the coast, ‘Now half-deserted by the flood, we sail'd, ‘While Fecan's cliffs, their heads in darkness lost, ‘Tower'd o'er us. Turning to my gallant host, ‘Who silently survey'd them, thus I said: “Behold, brave comrades! our appointed post; “Here must the proof of English worth be made, “Here must your gen'rous scorn of danger be display'd. XXXIX “What tho' tremendously these barriers rise, “What tho' their base incessant billows lave? “Honour commands, and leads us to our prize! “From trait'rous force the Cyprian Maid to save “She bids us intermediate danger brave. “Should we, her call obeying, meet our doom, “Should fate decree us here a wat'ry grave, “Our memory dear to chivalry shall bloom, “And valour's choicest wreaths shall decorate our tomb.” XL ‘Not long did we await, for from the height ‘Wide-waving soon a flaming torch we view'd: ‘It's glare shot thro' the shades obscure of night, ‘And mark'd with partial gleam the summit rude. ‘Judging that Somerville had well pursued ‘His enterprising course, without delay ‘From our small deck another torch I shew'd, ‘And thrice disclos'd it's agitated ray; ‘Then, hurrying to the beech, upon our oars we lay. XLI ‘Around us all was dreary, still and dark, ‘When, as the crag impatiently we eyed, ‘A cord descending slowly tow'rds our bark, ‘And undulating o'er the mountain's side, ‘The rising breeze obeying, we espied. ‘To this the cable, thro' whose long extent ‘Short sticks at distances were fix'd, we tied, ‘By whose propitious aid we boldly meant ‘To urge our desp'rate course, and dare the dread ascent. XLII ‘Again our flaming signal we display'd. ‘Straightway our friends their labour 'gan to ply, ‘And soon the huge machine their hands obey'd. ‘Far as our sight it's progress could descry, ‘We saw it slowly mounting tow'rds the sky. ‘In agonizing silence still we gaz'd, ‘Now a pray'r off'ring, breathing now a sigh, ‘As on the height our wistful eyes we rais'd; ‘When suddenly the torch again resplendent blaz'd. XLIII “Comrades!” I cried, “th' eventful time is come, “When on ourselves and Heav'n we must depend. “The Pow'r, whose will must regulate our doom, “The boldly-daring soldier will befriend. “Say, who among ye all will first ascend? “Whom as our vent'rous leader shall we greet? “I, as the last, your progress will attend, “And resolute my purpose to complete, “My sword shall bar his way who meditates retreat.” XLIV ‘I said. One impulse seem'd t'inspire my host; ‘All at pre-eminence in danger aim'd, ‘Alike all courted the distinguish'd post, ‘When Segrave, louder than the rest, exclaim'd, “Sprung from a race of valiant captains, fam'd “For deeds whose lustre decorates our clime, “By me my ancestors shall ne'er be sham'd: “Be mine the glorious priv'lege first to climb, “And first to meet the foe on yonder heights sublime!” XLV ‘In vain I strove to moderate his pride, ‘In vain I told him that a Chief so young ‘Could ill suffice our enterprize to guide; ‘He from my hold with wild impatience flung, ‘And on the swinging cable nimbly sprung, ‘Which with his sudden effort seem'd to shake. ‘Mounting, the song of Talifer he sung, ‘And vauntingly besought us haste to make, ‘Lest we should prove too late his triumph to partake. XLVI ‘With calmer fortitude the rest advanc'd. ‘Grasping the ladder with observant heed, ‘As tow'rds the sea beneath our eyes we glanc'd, ‘And felt the cable tremble with our tread, ‘The unexampled boldness of the deed ‘With strange and solemn awe our bosoms smote. ‘But soon unable were we to recede: ‘For now the rising tide remov'd our boat, ‘And on the billows wide our cable 'gan to float. XLVII ‘Now at the mercy of the sea and wind, ‘And vibrating with both, our host ascended. ‘Darkness with risk t'appal our souls combin'd: ‘The frail support on which our lives depended, ‘The doubtful issue which our toils attended, ‘The cliffs above, the breaking waves beneath, ‘All that could daunt the firmest spirit blended. ‘Fate seem'd to menace in the breeze's breath, ‘The surge with hollow roar denounc'd impending death. XLVIII ‘Yet, urg'd by zeal and honour, on we went: ‘And now, midway between the beach and sky, ‘We had accomplish'd half our dread ascent, ‘And still our purpose urg'd, when from on high ‘I heard a feeble and half-utter'd cry, ‘And suddenly was check'd our bold career. ‘I learn'd that Segrave, who had dar'd defy ‘The horrors of the night and ocean drear, ‘Had stopt, with terror struck, and petrified with fear. XLIX ‘Lest the contagious influence of his dread ‘Should thro' th' associates of my toil pervade, ‘(Which recollection of the horrors spread ‘On all sides round us not unlikely made) ‘To him immediate orders I convey'd ‘To mount aloft and prove himself a man. ‘But vainly to arouse him I essay'd. ‘And now to share th' alarm the rest began, ‘And thro' the crouded line desponding murmurs ran. L ‘Inflam'd by disappointment and despair, ‘And conscious that a moment now to lose ‘Our fate would seal, I breath'd a hasty pray'r. ‘Resolv'd, whate'er might chance, myself t'expose, ‘I bad my comrades keep in order close, ‘And, climbing o'er their backs, held on my way, ‘'Till to our dastard guide at length I rose. ‘So overwhelm'd I found him with dismay, ‘That scarcely to my words could he attention pay. LI ‘To 'wake him from his lethargy I sought; ‘But finding that to nothing he replied, ‘Him by the throat with my left hand I caught, ‘And, as I closely grasp'd him, to his side ‘My faulchion keen I vig'rously applied. ‘Soon as he felt it, as with pow'rs renew'd, ‘To scale his course precipitous he tried. ‘My comrades, now reviv'd, his steps pursued, ‘And soon th' embattled height and Somerville we view'd. LII ‘Now rush'd we on the unsuspecting foe, ‘Our enterprize impatient to conclude. ‘Their bravest warriors sunk beneath our blow: ‘Our swords were stain'd with Gallia's choicest blood: ‘Uncheck'd our way thro' Fecan we pursued; ‘Our shouts of triumph made her tow'rs resound: ‘No more th' apostate Prince our force withstood: ‘Fair Chariclæa safe from harm we found, ‘Her smiles, our noblest meed, our arduous labours crown'd. LIII ‘Thrice nobly hast thou wrought,’ the King replied, ‘And prov'd thyself a brave and worthy Knight. ‘But say, Blondel! why seek'st thou thus to hide ‘The further deeds of that eventful night, ‘When victory deck'd thee with her trophies bright, ‘And glory hail'd thee as her favourite son? ‘Each interesting circumstance recite, ‘Nor, with a modesty ill-judging, shun ‘The merited applause by gen'rous valour won.’ LIV He ended. Nought the youthful Champion said, But glowing blushes overspread his cheek, As thus with smiles exclaim'd the Cyprian Maid. ‘Must I the triumphs of my hero speak? ‘Must I, in feeble phrase and language weak, ‘Become th' imperfect herald of his fame? ‘Ah! why should he, who dar'd my bonds to break, ‘Who sav'd my honour from despair and shame, ‘The sum of his deserts thus scruple to proclaim? LV ‘Say, is it not from feelings too resin'd ‘Thou striv'st thy signal merit to conceal? ‘That look confirms my thought! thus to the wind ‘I give my fears, thus what I boast to feel ‘With virtuous confidence I dare reveal. ‘To thee, great Prince! by whom his worth is known, ‘To thy congenial soul I make appeal: ‘I feel an int'rest in his just renown, ‘Share in his high exploits, and count his praise mine own! LVI ‘Need I describe what feelings pain'd my soul, ‘When, by foul force from Berengaria torn, ‘I fell within the Prince's dread controul? ‘As down the stream our bark was swiftly borne, ‘I gave myself to grief: sad and forlorn ‘I ruminated on my wayward fate, ‘And answer'd only with increase of scorn ‘The traitor's suit: nought but contempt and hate ‘His adulation mean and proffers could create. LVII ‘Soon to stern Fecan's dreaded walls we came. ‘Here, as I weeping sat, immers'd in thought, ‘And rack'd with dread of peril and of shame, ‘The Prince to calm my agitation sought, ‘And arguments of doubtful import brought: ‘But vain were his attempts my soul to move, ‘'Till, prostrate at my feet, my hand he caught, ‘And, with an insolent avowal, strove ‘To plead his amorous suit, and urge his hateful love. LVIII ‘Then from my trance arous'd, with high disdain ‘His boldness I besought him to correct, ‘And bad him his unlicenc'd hopes restrain. ‘He, with an air of taunting disrespect, ‘Exclaim'd, “Since thus my passion you neglect, “Deaf to my vows, and to my ardour cold, “On this stern pile and on my pow'r reflect: “Your haughty beauties here I captive hold, “'Tis mine to rule your fate, your stubbornness to mould.” LXIX ‘He said, and sullenly the chamber left, ‘Where I remain'd, alone, in anguish lost, ‘And of all hope, save that in Heav'n, bereft. ‘Sad images of woe my fancy cross'd: ‘His impious threat'nings, his inhuman boast, ‘A prospect black and horrible reveal'd. ‘Weeping I knelt, and to th' immortal host, ‘Guardians of virgin innocence, appeal'd, ‘My unprotected state from violence to shield. LX ‘O'er the rude cliffs and far-extending main ‘The hand of night her sable veil had strewn, ‘And darkness held her soul-appalling reign: ‘As if forgotten by the world, alone ‘I listen'd to the screech-owl's dismal moan, ‘Which seem'd despair and madness to invoke, ‘While, ever and anon, with hollow groan ‘The hoarse-resounding surge at distance broke, ‘And in my troubled mind reflexions sad awoke. LXI ‘But soon a diff'rent and more dreadful sound ‘Burst o'er mine ear, portending perils nigh. ‘The voice of festive mirth was heard around, ‘And the wide chamber echo'd with the cry ‘Of clam'rous joy and savage revelry. ‘Mingled with horrid shouts oft rose my name, ‘And oft the brutal Prince, in accents high, ‘His hopes of coming triumphs would proclaim, ‘And vauntingly exult in my approaching shame. LXII ‘Again to all-protecting Heav'n I knelt. ‘As to it's throne my meek petition flew, ‘Thrice arm'd against opposing fate I felt. ‘But soon more near the threat'ning chorus drew: ‘Thro' the long passages the noisy crew ‘Tow'rds my apartment lone appear'd to draw. ‘The impious band now ent'ring met my view, ‘And, as their torches blaz'd, with mingled awe ‘And horror at their head my tyrant base I saw. LXIII “Leave here some lights,” he cried, “and then to rest, “Or to fresh revelling, let all retreat!” ‘They prov'd observant of his foul behest, ‘While he, advancing tow'rds my distant seat, ‘Stagger'd along; my heart with terror beat ‘As he approach'd, and scarce could I respire, ‘As he essay'd his greetings to repeat: ‘His eyes shot glances of impure desire, ‘Ting'd were his bloated cheeks with lust's unhallow'd fire. LXIV “Forgive, fair Nymph!” he cried, “if duty's call “Kept me so long from beauty's shrine away. “Thus at your feet, your willing slave, I fall. “Now let your charms my past-gone toils repay; “And, while thro' pleasure's flow'ry paths we stray, “While thro' new scenes of untried bliss we rove, “Increasing joys shall grace the rising day; “Thy melting soul shall unknown transports prove, “And own the matchless pow'r of all-commanding love.” LXV ‘He said, and tow'rds me sprung. I started back, ‘And loudly cried, “Perfidious traitor, hence “Forbear thy base and dastardly attack: “Alike of courage destitute as sense, “Think'st thou to win me with thy vain pretence? “Hop'st thou to realize the ills th' hast plann'd? “Heav'n and it's Saints will prove my sure defence, “Will arm my soul thy fury to withstand, “Will crush thy foul design, and blast thine impious hand!” LXVI “Them and their force united I defy,” ‘Rejoin'd the Prince; “Do not my hopes repel, “Or coyly, when my pulse with love beats high, “When all my veins with madd'ning impulse swell—” ‘But how can I on his excesses dwell? ‘Ah! let me to recount his words forbear, ‘Nor, at th' expence of wounded feelings, tell ‘The brutal phrases which I blush'd to hear, ‘The threats he vainly us'd, the oaths he dar'd to swear. LXVII ‘At length, with passion and with wine inflam'd, ‘Me to his hated breast he rudely caught, ‘And boastfully his foul design proclaim'd. ‘Now in my soul Heav'n's blest ascendance wrought: ‘With anger, scorn, and indignation fraught, ‘I seiz'd the sword depending by his side, ‘And, ere of his unlook'd-for risk he thought, ‘To his unguarded neck the point applied, ‘And thus, while flash'd mine eyes with kindling fury, cried: LXVIII “Cease, wretch detested! from my wrath retire; “I feel immortal seraphs nerve my arm, “Brace my firm soul, and force unfelt inspire: “Cease, nor provoke my hand to work thy harm!” ‘Starting and pale he shudder'd with alarm, ‘But soon recov'ring, with accurs'd intent ‘He roughly strove my weak hand to disarm, ‘While I, th' attempt unable to prevent, ‘Struggling, with frantic cries the vaulted chamber rent. LXIX ‘Weaker and weaker now my forces grew, ‘When, as his foul intent he still pursued, ‘With deaf'ning crash the portal op'ning flew. ‘Before us my preserving angel stood! ‘As if with more than human pow'rs endued, ‘Forward he rush'd, and forcibly compell'd ‘The traitor to give o'er his purpose rude. ‘Him by the throat with potent grasp he held, ‘While warring pride and fear his recreant bosom swell'd. LXX ‘But soon superior influence pride obtain'd. ‘While flash'd with rage his eyes, “Presumptuous slave! “Say,” he exclaim'd, “how hast thou entrance gain'd? “Who to a stranger thus permission gave “With ruffian violence my wrath to brave? “Unhand me, caitiff! or a fate expect, “From which no pow'r thy forfeit life shall save. “Where are my slothful guards? Let them correct “This insolence, and thus atone for their neglect!” LXXI ‘Struggling he spake, and made the echoing hall ‘With outcries for his followers vile resound. ‘But him they heard not, nor obey'd his call. ‘Soon thro' the vaulted passages around ‘Shrieks and laments arose, and groans profound, ‘And exclamations dread with horror fraught, ‘Amid the deaf'ning clash of arms half drown'd. ‘He shudder'd as th' appalling sounds he caught, ‘And still t' escape the grasp of my protector sought. LXXII ‘Yet made he not the youth his hold forego, ‘Who, scornfully regarding him, replied, “Prince! who I am hereafter may'st thou know. “Heav'n, whose all-seeing eye thy crime espied, “Me to subvert thy plans was pleas'd to guide. “To guard insulted innocence I came, “To check thy foul and over-weening pride, “To vindicate yon suff'ring maiden's fame, “And brand detected guilt with infamy and shame.” LXXIII ‘Then turning tow'rds me, “Lady!” cried the youth, “Subdue thy fears, and calm thy troubled soul. “Doubt not my active vigilance and truth. “No more th' oppressor, who with purpose foul “At dead of night on thy retirement stole, “Shall here maintain his persecuting sway. “Henceforth thy pleasure shall his fate controul: “My friends, who now their banners proud display “On Fecan's tow'rs, thy will are ready to obey.” LXXIV “Oh guardian of my honour!” I exclaim'd, “Say, can I e'er the services requite, “Which sav'd me from the fate his treasons fram'd? “May Heav'n's best blessings on thy head alight, “Conduct to glory thy transcendent might, “And still to guard thee from misfortune deign! “But ah! remove yon traitor from my sight, “Whose hateful presence renovates my pain: “Leave me awhile alone composure to regain.” LXXV ‘Thus briefly, gracious Monarch! have I shewn ‘How Chariclæa's honour and repose ‘Their preservation owe to him alone. ‘Here fitly my recital might I close, ‘Could I remembrance of those moments lose, ‘When, pass'd his labours, back my hero came, ‘And angels witness'd our eternal vows; ‘When first I own'd a corresponding flame, ‘And dar'd my heart's sincere effusion to proclaim. LXXVI ‘To yonder Heav'n, which sav'd me from despair, ‘Let my exulting voice the truth confess: ‘Let me the transport which I felt declare, ‘When first I blushing heard his fond address, ‘When first he dar'd his tender suit to press, ‘And all the feelings of his heart pourtray'd! ‘Blest in the pow'r his high desert to bless, ‘The dictates pure of nature I obey'd, ‘As to the gallant youth I thus responsive said: LXXVII “That now, from mis'ry and dishonour free, “My breast no more with dread and anguish swells, “I owe, Blondel! to Providence and thee. “My mind, while on thy noble deeds it dwells, “Feels thy desert, and forcibly impels “My reason thy pretensions just to own. “True worth the mist of prejudice dispels: “Tho' born the heiress of the Cyprian throne, “Thee my protector twice from peril have I known. LXXVIII “I see thee great in virtue, and I scorn “The poor distinction of an empty name: “Valour's immortal wreaths thy brow adorn, “And Europe's suffrage shall confirm thy fame. “Far be from me that disingenuous shame “Which makes us glory in inflicting pain, “Which, while it feels a corresponding flame, “A cold indiff'rence teaches us to feign, “And bids us love repay with harshness and disdain.” LXXIX The Maiden ceas'd. Her eyes with transport beam'd; The tender blushes which her face o'er-spread Heralds of joy and raptur'd feelings seem'd: As she reclin'd her half-averted head, A smile celestial on the youth she shed, Who, kneeling, on the hand she gave him bow'd. “Ah Chariclæa! best belov'd!” he said, “Were by our King our union but allow'd! “Ah! would his voice confirm the homage which I vow'd.” LXXX “Your love to sanction,” cried the feeling Prince, “To ratify your plighted vows be mine! “My full concurrence let me thus evince: “May you with virtue happiness combine, “May love his choicest wreath for you entwine, “Long may you blest alike and blessing live, “And may a numerous and deserving line “From you, their great progenitors, derive “Both principles and strength in honour's race to strive!” LXXXI Thus spake the King, and join'd their willing hands. They, like the flow'r which to the solar ray It's golden circlet faithfully expands, As if appropriate rev'rence to display, To gratitude and mutual joy gave way. And now the gallant host around them press'd With greetings kind and gratulations gay; And, emulous their merits to attest, All hail'd their choice, and prais'd their Monarch's just behest. LXXXII Nought now to stay their wish'd return remain'd. Their vig'rous coursers o'er the champaign flew: Passing Foville, St. Clair's high seat they gain'd; Advancing thence, the forest met their view, Polluted lately by th' infernal crew Which Richard's virtue had compell'd to flight. It's paths accurs'd they sought not to pursue, But onward rode, and, ere the second night Approach'd, proud Rouen's walls rejoic'd their eager sight. LXXXIII Where, it's stream tending to the Seine, Rapaume 'Midst meadows flow'r-besprent and vallies fair, Normannia's grace and pride, is seen to roam, Their ample camp the warriors 'gan prepare. Meantime, tow'rds Rouen hast'ning to repair, The King, escorted by his Chiefs, advanc'd, Impatient to his anxious Queen to bear Tidings of all that had so strangely chanc'd, By triumphs unforeseen and full success enhanc'd. END OF BOOK XVI. BOOK XVII. ARGUMENT. Council of the French—Their projects to amuse the English by deceitful overtures, and to attack their divided forces—Their preparations being perceived by Mortimer, Reginald and Lestang set out to apprize the King of them— Their expedition and attack on Sancerre's camp—Richard, on Reginald's arrival, assembles a Council—Mountjoy brings Philip's insidious proposals—which are rejected—The English are order'd to prepare for battle on the morrow— Parting between Richard and Berengaria. I While thus the English warriors won fair fame, Beyond St. James's mount the Gallic host Fled in confusion strange, o'erwhelm'd with shame. Blasted their old renown, their honour lost, No more was heard their late exulting boast: Far from th' entrenchments which their blood had dy'd, They sought again Gaalor's moated post; There their dismay and foul defeat to hide, And, as they could, to sooth their disappointed pride. II From all secluded, and to grief a prey, Within the deep recesses of his hold Philip consum'd the melancholy day. He saw a dark futurity unfold, And fancy wrought presages dread to mould, Of Richard's triumph, and his own disgrace: Tho' still presumptuous hope, with outline bold, From John's attempt would brighter prospects trace, And victory's splendid meed within his grasp would place. III The gay enchantment blossom'd but to fade, And fleeting transport yielded soon to care, When, on Martainville's heights, in proud parade He saw the crimson banners kiss the air, And Mortimer his spreading camp prepare. More yet remain'd his anxious breast to pain: For now, to fill the measure of despair, His spies reported, that, across the Seine, Imperial Richard led his enterprising train. IV Soon rumour's trump proclaim'd misfortunes new: Of Fecan's loss it told, on whose high tow'r, Torn from his sway, the Red Cross standard flew, And John's disgrace, who, in disastrous hour, Surpriz'd, remain'd within his victor's pow'r. As when a seaman with a tempest strives, And, while the elements around him show'r, His luckless vessel tow'rds the breakers drives, Th' augmented risk his soul of energy deprives: V So o'er his self-accusing spirit spread Corroding anguish, terror and dismay; Doubts upon doubts arose, and dread on dread. To all the pow'rful Peers who own'd his sway, He bad Mountjoy his mandate straight convey In council to convene: his high behest They disobey'd not, but without delay Impatiently from ev'ry quarter press'd. Them, when assembled, thus the troubled King address'd. VI “I know not, Chieftains! whether most to blame “Obdurate fortune, or the weak neglect “Of those to whom I trusted Gallia's fame: “But on the change 'tis dreadful to reflect, “Which chance or treason have avail'd t' effect. “The very means, which 'gainst my foe I plann'd, “Now 'gainst myself he threatens to direct: “On Fecan's walls his boastful banners stand, “My most esteem'd ally feels his revengeful hand. VII “Our noblest youth, our best defence and pride, “Unhonour'd press yon ill-contested plain: “They bled, but not our fortunes to decide; “They sank, but not their country's cause to gain. “Yet happier they, than those who live to stain “Their old renown with merited disgrace, “To see yon hostile bands, with stern disdain “Mocking our toils, their march insulting trace, “Dare us to new assaults, and brave us to our face. VIII “Oh curs'd reflection! from our foul mischance “New triumphs English Richard will atchieve, “And pluck fresh laurels from degraded France! “What credit will th' historian's page receive, “Which tells that Gallia's primest Chiefs could leave “The path of glory ere their meed was won? “Say, what can now our blighted hopes retrieve? “Must we forego the strife so well begun, “And by concessions try impending risk to shun? IX “My soul the sentiment ignoble spurns! “Can I resolve to own a vassal's sway? “No! at the thought my heart indignant burns! “Let fate her blackest web of woe display, “Let fortune frown our int'rests to betray, “My rank superior yet will I maintain! “My sword to honour yet shall hew my way: “Resolv'd to fall, or worthily to reign, “My arm, without your aid, shall Philip's rights sustain.” X Thus spake the Prince; and, while th' assembled Chiefs In mute surprize were fix'd, Sargines thus said. “Tho', Royal Sir, we share in all the griefs “By you with such pathetic force display'd, “Ne'er can we own that Gallia's peers betray'd “Their country's int'rests or their own renown. “Live we, alas! to hear our King degrade, “By censures harsh, the guardians of his crown, “Who oft in peril's front their loyalty have shewn! XI “To us, who often at the price of blood “Have reap'd immortal honour by his side, “To us, who circling round him have withstood “Embattled hosts and menac'd death desied, “Shall honour's well-earn'd trophy be denied? “Not thus of those, who merit his applause, “Does England's King injuriously decide: “He feels for those whose zeal maintains his cause, “And from their grateful hearts his best dependence draws. XII “He ever is the same. When war's alarms “Call'd forth his might, I've view'd him in the field, “Like Mars himself pre-eminent in arms. “Nor less his virtues were in peace reveal'd: “Soldier himself, the soldier's pains he heal'd; “He sooth'd the anguish which he could not cure; “To him the injur'd call'd, the weak appeal'd; “So equal flow'd his justice and so pure, “He seem'd his people's rights commission'd to insure.” XIII “And is it thus,” exclaim'd th' indignant King, “That, with the praises of my mortal foe, “To my torn mind you consolation bring? “Curs'd be the virtues, which, with specious shew, “Forbid the stream of my renown to flow, “And blast the glories which my deeds might claim; “This is indeed the sum of human woe, “When Gallia's Peers conspire their master's shame, “And build on his despair his hated rival's fame!” XIV “Sire!” cried Sargines, “I hardly could have thought “That truth's pure voice my Sov'reign could affect. “By his harsh censure more discretion taught, “I go to remedy my past neglect, “And zeal by future prudence to correct.” He said, and, striving to suppress his heat, Turn'd tow'rds the door with dignified aspect: But Nanteuil, quick his purpose to defeat, His steps arresting led the warrior to his seat: XV Then thus, in accents mild, his friend bespoke. “When anxious cares depress our Monarch's soul, “It suits us not his anger to provoke: “'Twere wiser and more gen'rous to controul “His heart-felt griefs, his sorrows to console. “When, on the adverse field, their banners wide “Our foes with bold defiance shall unroll, “Then may we aptly shew our martial pride, “Urge our resistless course, and threat'ning death deride.” XVI “Well hast thou,” he replied, “thy judgment shewn: “Henceforth, I trust, no less my self-command “Shall in debate than in war's front be known. “But now more urgent topics should be scann'd: “Rouen's high walls, with English warriors mann'd, “Our congregated forces still oppose, “And still reproachful of our valour stand: “With victory flush'd the legions of our foes “Insult us, while our hours in vain debate we lose.” XVII Thus he. Around approving murmurs spread, And emulous the Chieftains seem'd to cheer Their gallant friend, when thus the Monarch said. “When struggling passions in our mind we bear, “It often chances that our judgment clear, “Warp'd from it's bent, to doubts unjust gives way. “If I have err'd, forget it, noble Peer! “Henceforth my confidence shall well repay “The true and loyal faith which all your deeds display. XVIII “From the advantage which our foes have gain'd, “We may presume, that scarcely will they now “From deeds of greater import be restrain'd, “Should we, by sloth or negligence, allow “To full maturity their means to grow: “Fresh reinforcements, from their neighb'ring coast, “To swell their ranks incessantly will flow, “While we, with blighted hopes and honour lost, “Shall be compell'd to fly before their conq'ring host. XIX “Since such our instant peril, I propose “By crafty propositions first to deal, “By terms insidious to beguile our foes, “And such conditions specious to reveal, “As may induce them to relax their zeal. “Should the event of this defeat my aim, “To your known prowess then must I appeal; “You then, regardful of your well-earn'd fame, “Your King and Country's praise by fresh desert will claim. XX “Then be it thine, Des Barres! to keep at bay “The armament, which, on Martainville's height, “It's station holds in menacing array, “While I, conducting tow'rds Rapaume my might, “Provoke my weaken'd rival to the fight. “Meantime, while we to what behoves attend, “The Chiefs dispers'd on every hand invite, “Hither with instant speed their march to bend, “By a decisive blow our menac'd ills to end.” XXI He said. With grief and inward discontent The Chieftains heard the projects he had plann'd: Each from his presence sad and silent went, And sought the station of his sep'rate band. Meanwhile, as these enforc'd their King's command, From the high mount, which overlook'd the plain, Brave Mortimer their various movements scann'd: As from their camp pour'd forth the warlike train, On every side arose the trumpet's martial strain. XXII To Reginald, the partner of his care, He cried, “Or ill their purposes I guess, “Or an attack our enemies prepare. “See'st thou, as if presuming on success, “Their legions with impatience onward press? “Mark you yon Knight, advancing o'er the field, “With aspect bold and dignified address, “On whose emblazon'd and far-spreading shield “A leopard charg'd with gold Byzantines is reveal'd? XXIII “'Tis brave Des Barres, in peril's front oft tried: “Those ensigns on the memorable day “He gain'd, when Acre Philip's force defied, “Condemn'd to own our more successful sway. “See, as amid their ranks he holds his way, “The def'rence which his high atchievements claim “With salutation due the warriors pay, “While with exulting shouts they hail his name, “His oft-tried worth declare and well-attested fame. XXIV “Trust me, my friend! the hour is near at hand, “When, to chastise our over-weening foe, “Richard's just cause our prowess will demand. “It glads my heart to find, that those, who owe “So deeply, now appear dispos'd to shew “Some inclination to discharge their debt. “My spirits at the thought more freely flow! “Oh! that already we were fairly met, “That the vast stake were on our favour'd faulchions set!” XXV “All seems,” replied the Chief, “to indicate, “That our opponents are resolv'd to try “The battle's issue, and to tempt their fate. “Methinks, since thus their movements we descry, “We should our friends at Rouen left supply “With prompt intelligence of their design. “Perhaps our King returning may be nigh; “Aware of their intent, his force may join, “And 'gainst the rude assault with Leicester may combine. XXVI “Yet, while their legions thus the champaign fill, “And while around the foe their stations hold, “The enterprize demands no vulgar skill. “Me, ever for our Monarch's int'rests bold, “Prepar'd to execute the task behold! “The ev'ning lours my purpose to befriend, “Their sombrous veil propitious clouds unfold, “From the wide vallies mantling fogs ascend, “And o'er the mountain's brow collected vapours blend.” XXVII “Thy offer like thyself is brave and fair,” Cried Mortimer; “but let a chosen few “Of known desert thy expedition share.” With that Lestang his shining faulchion drew, Exclaiming, “To my friend and Sov'reign true, “Be mine to share his hazardous essay! “Together in the school of war we grew, “Together let us duty's call obey, “And o'er the hostile field united force our way.” XXVIII “Lestang! my valued friend!” the Chief replied, “Our enterprize no other aid requires “Than thy known worth in which we all confide. “But lo! the sun far in the west retires, “Scarcely yon hills reflect his parting fires! “Now holds the twilight it's ambiguous reign, “And nature with our bold attempt conspires. “Let us not waste our time in converse vain: “Much yet remains to do ere Rouen's walls we gain.” XXIX He said, and vaulted on his vig'rous steed: Nor ardour less his brave associate shew'd. As down the height they urg'd their coursers' speed, In either bosom glory's impulse glow'd. Herman, Lestang's Esquire, behind them rode: From earliest infancy his Lord he lov'd; With him he left his father's calm abode, With him the chance of war full oft had prov'd, And o'er Judæa's clime with him intrepid rov'd. XXX Still was the scene: in many a circling flight, Skirting the mist, the bat pursued his way; And, pois'd on heavy wing, the bird of night, As thro' the glades obscure he sought his prey, Chaunted aloud his melancholy lay. Shrouded in clouds the sullen ev'ning clos'd, While momentary tints of silv'ry grey Athwart their veil th' ascending moon disclos'd: They pass'd, and straight in shade the wide expanse repos'd. XXXI As when, from some secluded mountain's brow, The lordly Falcon sails across the skies, His flight he checks to view the plains below; If chance a latent covey he descries, He marks with ken assur'd his destin'd prize, And darts with rapid pinion to the ground: So rode the gallant Knights, their watchful eyes On ev'ry quarter still extending round, Their ev'ry faculty in deep attention bound. XXXII Not far had they advanc'd, when, tow'rds the side Where it's high boughs a wood was seen to rear, A form quick-glancing 'cross the plain they 'spied: A courier's gabardine he seem'd to wear, And in his hand a sturdy staff to bear, And swift his pace, as one on speed intent. The cautious Knights suspended their career, Gazing, while still his way the stranger went, And o'er the beaten path his lonely footsteps bent. XXXIII Onward he pass'd, and no observance took, But still with diligence his travel press'd, While both the Chieftains fix'd on him their look. At length Lestang his warlike friend address'd; “I deem it right yon varlet to arrest: “No common matters, if I reason well, “Induce him to pursue his darkling quest; “Let us the cause discover, and compel “The purport of his charge his fault'ring tongue to tell. XXXIV “Here let us stand; an enemy so mean “Too poor an object for our force would make: “Let us to Herman leave the task; I ween “His prowess soon the foeman will o'ertake.” Thus to his comrade bold he laughing spake. Forthwith th' Esquire address'd him to the chace: As near he came, the Courier 'gan to quake, And fearfully he ran with quicken'd pace, Oft turning back his head as Herman urg'd the race. XXXV Soon as th' Esquire approach'd his trembling prey, “Caitiff,” cried he, “give o'er thy fruitless speed! “Instant thy unavailing efforts stay!” The Courier of his words took little heed, But many an Ave breath'd and many a Creed, And strove his quick pursuer to outgo. With that th' Esquire impell'd his nimble steed, And on his shoulders broad bestow'd a blow, Which check'd his course and on the green-sward laid him low. XXXVI The Chieftains, now approaching, from the ground With heedful caution rais'd the fallen wight, Whom yet his late mishap appear'd t' astound: Gazing around him with increas'd affright, In piteous terms he moan'd his luckless plight. Soon as he seem'd his senses to collect, “The purpose of thy journey straight recite,” Lestang exclaim'd; “Say where dost thou direct “Thy secret way, or here thy final doom expect.” XXXVII He said, and threat'ning wav'd his glitt'ring blade. “Tho' ill my tongue my meaning can express,” The Courier cried, “by terror thus dismay'd, “Yet, since hard fate affords me no redress, “Thus will I briefly my intent confess. “By Philip charg'd, I hasten'd tow'rds Sancerre, “Commission'd the illustrious Chief to press “For instant march his warriors to prepare, “And, ere to-morrow's dawn, his Monarch's toils to share.” XXXVIII “Where does the Chieftain now his station hold?” Said Reginald. “Forbear thy threat'ning hand,” Replied he, “and the whole I will unfold. “See'st thou where Annebaud's green shades expand? “Beyond their farthest verge his ensigns stand: “His force I know not, yet 'tis small I ween, “And for aggression ill prepar'd his band; “Nor could he well assistant troops convene, “Were on his camp t' advance an enemy unseen.” XXXIX He spoke, and sought with pray'rs their wrath to charm, And oft with tears inforc'd his pleadings vain, The threat'ning Chieftains' vengeance to disarm, While they, regarding him with stern disdain, Debated how they might advantage gain From what his fears had forc'd him to disclose: But first they deem'd it prudent to detain Their captive, lest he might alarm their foes, And their advent'rous plan instruct them to oppose. XL Soon as their purpose Herman understood, He led his pris'ner tow'rds a sturdy oak, Which tower'd within the precincts of the wood; Then from his steed a cord sufficient took, And straightly bound him: with dismay he shook, And much he pray'd, and much the Chiefs besought That they with pity on his state would look. His supplication vain they heeded nought, Engross'd by graver cares of what might yet be wrought. XLI Around them night array'd in shadows reign'd, And oft, amid th' impenetrable shade, The interlacing boughs their course detain'd: Yet resolutely they their progress made, And, gaining now a more expanded glade, Commun'd on what they recently had heard. Checking his steed at length, Lestang thus said: “Should perils, when our duty calls, be fear'd? “Let us but dare the feat, and half our doubts are clear'd. XLII “The hour of midnight is not yet at hand, “And from us now Sancerre cannot be far. “If warily our daring scheme be plann'd, “Him from to-morrow's junction we may bar, “And thus the aid which Philip hopes may mar. “Should we succeed, but little time we lose, “And should we fall, 'tis but the chance of war. “Methinks, were we the occasion to refuse, “Our comrades might our want of enterprize accuse.” XLIII “Great is the hazard,” Reginald rejoin'd, “But come what will, since honour prompts the deed, “In me a true associate shall you find.” He said. Each Chieftain spurr'd his gen'rous steed, And thro' the forest with increasing speed, Heedless of all impediments, advanc'd. It's verge attain'd, at distance o'er the mead Some scatter'd lights they saw, which feebly glanc'd, And thro' the void obscure short scintillations lanc'd. XLIV “There, there!” exclaim'd Lestang, “our foe behold! “Let us their careless centinels surprize—” “Suspend,” cried Reginald, “your purpose bold; “Tho' present risk the valiant heart defies, “Rashness alone precaution will despise. “Let Herman tow'rds their camp in silence go: “His just report will aid us to devise, “How best our efforts may annoy the foe, “And where with most effect may fall our vengeful blow.” XLV He said. Th' Esquire obey'd. Within the wood, Awaiting his return, the warlike pair In mute and anxious expectation stood. But soon his welcome presence eas'd their care. “Chieftains!” he cried, “intelligence I bear, “Which seems propitious to your daring hope: “The foe, of all aggression unaware, “And unprepar'd with your assault to cope, “May to your vengeance full afford unbounded scope. XLVI “When to their small encampment I drew near, “Close to it's rampart I contriv'd to creep. “Stillness prevail'd: no voices could I hear, “No sentinels appear'd their watch to keep: “Some waning torches, thro' the darkness deep “Shedding a glimm'ring light, suffic'd to shew “The warriors scatter'd and oppress'd by sleep, “Their senses so absorb'd, they scarce would know, “When fate arriv'd, whence came it's overwhelming blow.” XLVII Their plan the Chieftains soon arrang'd, and straight Each, from his steed descending, gave the rein, To Herman's hand, and bad him near await. As when, on torrid Barca's sandy plain, A Lion scents the Antelope's throng'd train, Swiftly he rushes on his timid prey, With bloody feast the champaign parch'd to stain: So o'er the heath the Knights pursued their way, Insensible to fear, and eager for the fray. XLVIII Approaching, all in silence wrapt they found; The half-expiring torches scarcely gleam'd, While here and there, extended on the ground, Of past-gone toils the slumb'ring warriors dream'd. Soon with their gore the Chieftains' faulchions stream'd: Some fell unconscious of their fatal doom, Some deeply groan'd, some lamentably scream'd: While death exulting hover'd in the gloom, Wav'd his ill-omen'd arm, and shook his threat'ning plume. XLIX Undaunted they pursued their vengeful course: As havock and dismay around they shed, Full many a Chieftain sank beneath their force, And, undistinguish'd 'mid th' inglorious dead, And unreveng'd, his martial spirit fled. Loud exclamations now, with horror fraught, Rose thro' the camp, and new confusion spread. They reach'd Sancerre: his weapon straight he caught, And, guided by the sound, the scene of carnage sought. L As on he rush'd, from the deep-mantling cloud, Which had obscur'd her orb, the Queen of Night Burst forth: all Heav'n with new-born radiance glow'd, The plains and woods confess'd her influence bright, And the wide landscape shone with silv'ry light. With mingled rage and grief Sancerre beheld His comrades slain, or in unseemly flight Thro' ev'ry quarter of the field impell'd, While the confed'rate Knights the tide of slaughter swell'd. LI As when of hinds a weak and tim'rous herd, By shepherd dogs alarm'd, in terror flies, The well-horn'd stag, by gen'rous feelings stirr'd, While vengeance glances from his sparkling eyes, Intrepidly th' aggressors rude defies; So fill'd with indignation on he came: “Whence this alarm, whence,” cried he, “this surprise? “Cease your base flight, nor thus consign to shame “By cowardice your own and your commander's fame!” LII Thus said he. Fruitless prov'd his bold essay: Yet still he sought their passage to arrest, When, as around he look'd, the moon's bright ray Glancing disclos'd Lestang's high-polish'd crest, As rapidly he urg'd his bloody quest, And 'neath his arm the flying recreants bow'd. Disdain and fury fir'd the Chieftain's breast; He darted forward thro' the trembling croud, And, his keen faulchion waving, thus exclaim'd aloud. LIII “Whoe'er thou art, whose desolating hand “Has forc'd yon dastards foully to retreat, “Behold! th' avenger of my host I stand: “Sancerre himself is here thy rage to meet!” “None but thyself was wanting to compleat “My triumph,” cried Lestang: “soon shalt thou view “How well my weapon shall thy puissance greet!” He said, and spurning the ignoble crew, O'er bleeding heaps of slain to meet Sancerre he flew. LIV Brief, tho' tremendous, prov'd their stern appeal. Lestang his sword with bold assurance heav'd, And struck his foe's broad shield: the sounding steel, True to it's trust, the rude assault receiv'd, And from the threat'ned harm it's lord repriev'd. Sancerre, recov'ring from th' aggression rude, With better aim his dread intent atchiev'd; Lestang, his helmet crush'd, and bath'd in blood, Stagger'd, while from his mouth distill'd a crimson'd flood. LV Again the Chieftain struck, nor struck in vain: His pond'rous blade fell heavy, and impell'd The fainting warrior headlong on the plain. With exultation now his bosom swell'd, When Reginald, who still with force unquell'd O'er the red field the flying squadron drave, The wayward fortunes of his friend beheld. Tow'rds him he rush'd, the menac'd wrath to brave, And from impending fate his comrade bold to save. LVI “Touch not his valued life!” he loudly cried; “By one who oft thy prowess has survey'd “Art thou, presumptuous Chieftain! now defied!” He said, and, whirling round his vengeful blade, On his proud helm with vig'rous onset laid; But, ere he could his fierce assault repeat, Sancerre his victim left, and undismay'd His new assailant boldly turn'd to meet: Nor stay'd he long his foe with manly force to greet. LVII Awhile well-balanc'd victory held the scale, And either Knight to gain her suffrage sought: But Reginald was destin'd to prevail. With such resistless energy he wrought, That to the ground the Gallic Chief he brought. Bleeding he sank, to Heav'n his spirit flew. But now, with shame and deep resentment fraught At sight of his defeat, the dastard crew Around the English Knight with fell intention drew. LVIII As when base village curs presume t' attack A gen'rous mastiff, he with proud disdain Eyes them, nor condescends his pace to slack; But, should some champion of th' ignoble train Dare with rude gripe his passage to restrain, His potent fangs the rash aggressor rend: So, tho' around him peal'd the foes amain, Nought did the Chief to their assault attend, Alone engross'd by care to aid his bleeding friend. LIX In vain t' arouse him with his voice he tried; But, raising him with caution from the ground, Gently his batter'd helmet he untied, And the red current wiping from his wound, Across his head his scarf embroider'd bound. Meantime, the foe from ev'ry quarter rush'd: Like summer gnats they buzz'd and teaz'd around, While their rude swarms contemptuously he brush'd, Their murm'rings marr'd, and oft their feeble corselets crush'd. LX They still, in numbers confident, advanc'd, While Reginald, to virtuous friendship true, Supporting tenderly Lestang entranc'd, As from the scene of carnage he withdrew, Those who most boldly onward press'd o'erthrew. As thus incumber'd he small progress made, Seizing his horn, a pow'rful blast he blew. The well-known signal Herman straight obey'd, And hastily came on the gallant pair to aid. LXI Soon as he saw his faint and bleeding lord, His bosom swell'd with vengeance and despair, And forth instinctively he drew his sword. “Thy brave attempt,” cried Reginald, “forbear: “My friend's protection be it thine to share, “While our presumptuous foes by me are fac'd.” Then lifting up Lestang, with tender care Him on his courser properly he plac'd, And left him to th' Esquire, who closely him embrac'd. LXII When he perceiv'd him safe from further harm, At the base herd with double rage he drove: They fled dispers'd before his pow'rful arm, Some imprecating succour from above, Some doom'd the terrors of his wrath to prove. As, when a storm its ravages extends, Stript are the leafy honours of the grove, It's far-extending boughs the tempest rends; And thro' it's inmost shades the stricken forest bends: LXIII So Reginald amid the trembling band Spread wide destruction, and with vengeful force Prov'd the ascendance of his vig'rous hand. But now no more were heard their outcries hoarse; Thro' streams of gore, o'er many a mangled corse, The Chief return'd, and, on his vig'rous steed Vaulting, tow'rds Rouen's walls resum'd his course. Yet rode he not with his accustom'd speed, Lest his companion's wound, ill staunch'd, again should bleed. LXIV Ere he the well-known ramparts reach'd, the moon, Again involv'd in clouds whose dark veil swept Across her waning orb, had reach'd her noon. But, tho' in rest surrounding nature slept, His watchful vigils England's Monarch kept. To him the Chief was anxious to repair; Yet first he tried to find some leech adept, Who, skill'd in all Hygeia's precepts rare, Might for his suff'ring friend employ his healing care. LXV This pious duty well perform'd, in haste He sought the King, and to his private ear The movements of the Gallic army trac'd. “Their hostile purpose not unpleas'd I hear,” The Monarch answer'd; “let them but appear, “And English valour shall their presence greet. “But night grows old, and morning now is near: “Send forth to summon all our Chiefs to meet, “On what may best behove our exigence to treat.” LXVI Soon as his will was known the Peers obey'd. When all assembled in attention sat, And ev'ry eye an earnest wish display'd To learn the object of their grave debate, The King began succinctly to narrate What Reginald had told, and how the foes Their might around conven'd, when from the gate, With sudden burst disturbing night's repose, A trumpet's piercing notes, repeated thrice, arose. LXVII “Bayntun! go forth and learn,” exclaim'd the King, “What warlike summons thus the still air rends, “And who thus hails us information bring.” He went. Returning soon, “Mountjoy attends,” He cried, “and thus his humble rev'rence sends. “Charg'd by the Gallic Monarch to declare “A weighty trust, his course he hither bends: “He says his mission no delay will bear, “And from your courtesy expects reception fair.” LXVIII “Bid him forthwith approach, and say we know,” Replied the King, “what rights his functions claim: “Let him the purport of his mission shew.” Escorted as his character became, He thus advancing said: “Mountjoy my name, “By Philip charg'd of what concerns the weal “Of either state his pleasure to proclaim, “And, in this noble presence, to reveal “A proposition fram'd your enmities to heal. LXIX “Thus speaks my King. Too long has ruthless war, “With savage sway and domination wild, “Prevail'd the face of Normandy to mar. “Her vine-clad hills, her vales where plenty smil'd, “Her blest retreats by slaughter are defil'd: “No more the peasant at returning eve “Hails his chaste spouse or clasps his darling child, “The village nymphs no more the light dance weave, “No more at nature's call their panting bosoms heave. LXX “Desirous the stern contest to conclude, “He thus prefers the quarrel to decide, “And at a stroke to end the fatal feud. “Let the two Monarchs name, on either side, “Five hardy Knights of skill and valour tried, “And let them swear, whate'er th' event may be, “By this fair ordeal truly to abide. “Thus shall your fates with fortune's will agree, “And thus from further ills Normannia shall be free.” LXXI “Mountjoy! the purport of thy mission high,” Return'd the King, “discreetly hast thou said; “Now lend attention while I thus reply. “Heav'n knows, no hope from mad ambition bred “Myself, or those who grace my cause, has led “In these domains the Gallic King to seek. “If here in hostile guise our banners spread, “The fault is his, who dar'd his oaths to break, “And on these injur'd plains his foul revenge to wreak. LXXII “On that Great Pow'r, who all my counsels knows, “To whom my inmost purpose is reveal'd, “With confidence unshaken I repose. “By open force provok'd and fraud conceal'd, “I stand prepar'd upon the tented field “To meet th' invader with aggression rude: “Yet rather would I from destruction shield “The unoffending, and prevent the flood “Of, what I value most, my brave companions' blood. LXXIII “I therefore with his fair proposal close, “Provided that of either gallant band “We who conduct the war a part compose. “Then, when we, King to King, and hand to hand, “Our prize a realm, in opposition stand, “When on our faulchions, oft in battle tried, “Shall hang the fortunes of this suff'ring land, “Let arbitrating Heav'n our fates decide, “And, as our cause is good, our arms to victory guide!” LXXIV “No!” cried Mountjoy, as he with rev'rence bent, “Such are not Philip's terms. Thus I presume “In other guise to speak his mild intent. “Much he laments that war's fell chance should doom “Such worth chivalric to an early tomb; “Much it concerns him that these warriors brave, “Vig'rous and yet in all their youthful bloom, “Blest with each gift which bounteous nature gave, “Should rush to certain death and idly court a grave. LXXV “He, tho' in numbers confident, inclines “For mercy's sake his triumphs to forego, “And, mov'd by pity, conquest's meed resigns. “He wills that all his proffer'd boon should know. “Anxious to terminate this scene of woe, “He asks if from this too long harrass'd shore “You will on fair and just conditions go; “If you prefer to tempt your fate once more, “Or, as he wishes, peace and friendship to restore. LXXVI “If such your choice, abandon Fecan's tow'rs: “Surrender all your pris'ners to his hand: “Without delay embark your warlike pow'rs; “Fully conceding to my King's command “What now he holds in this contested land. “On these mild terms, he pledges his consent “To your free passage from the Norman strand. “I wait to know if war be your intent, “Or if returning peace shall further ills prevent.” LXXVII He said. Disdain in ev'ry breast awoke, Vengeance illumin'd ev'ry warrior's face, And thro' their ranks indignant clamours broke: But to respect their kindling rage gave place, As, turning tow'rds them, with his 'custom'd grace Richard address'd them. “Friends! awhile forbear; “Full well your gen'ral sentiment I trace: “Thus let my voice our common will declare, “Then, as our cause becomes, for instant march prepare. LXXVIII “Mountjoy! thy proffers we have heard: receive “With fit attention our resolv'd reply. “Whate'er our fate, let not your King believe “That Englishmen, when honour calls, will fly, “Or that they basely will submit to buy “By scandalous concessions a retreat. “Tell him we know to conquer or to die. “Let him be silent, 'till, by our defeat, “A title he acquire his insults to repeat. LXXIX “Thinks he that England's Monarch, lost to fame, “His Heav'n-committed charge so little knows, “As thus to stamp his country's cause with shame? “Could he with such degrading offers close, “Tell him, each drop of gen'rous blood which flows “In English veins indignantly would burn, “And nerve their souls such treason to oppose! “With this reply to Gallia's King return: “Tell him his proffer base with proud contempt we spurn!” LXXX As thus the King with manly firmness spoke, The Chieftains silent stood in thought profound: But, when he ended, thro' the chamber broke Shouts of applause; exulting cries around Rose high, and made the vaulted hall resound. “Since your election is for war's debate,” Mountjoy departing cried, “Oh King renown'd! “I go my fruitless mission to narrate, “Yet with respect impress'd, and sorrowing for your fate.” LXXXI “Then,” cried the King, “to-morrow's dread appeal “The justice of our enterprise shall shew, “And Heav'n's all-pow'rful will our doom shall seal. “Tell your false Sov'reign his designs we know, “And that, when morning's earliest tints shall glow, “In equal field to meet him we prepare. “Now to your King return: yet, ere you go, “Our hospitality and largess share; “Then, with what speed you may, our stern defiance bear.” LXXXII He said. While all their zeal and hopes express'd, Mountjoy with low obeisance left the hall, And Richard thus th' impatient Peers address'd. “Th' impending hour alike imports us all: “On all alike imperious duties call. “Let ev'ry Chief prepare his bold array, “At early dawn to meet insulting Gaul. “Meantime, ere yet our banners we display, “The dictates of my soul I hasten to obey.” LXXXIII Thus saying, from the hall he pass'd in haste, Attended only by the brave Blondel. As the extending galleries he trac'd, “Hard is th' attempt,” exclaim'd he, “to repel “Feelings on which the heart delights to dwell: “Yet this ungracious lesson must we learn. “To-morrow's fortunes Heav'n alone can tell; “We may prevail, or never may return, “Yet honour bids us think ourselves our least concern. LXXXIV “Still, ere we go one sacrifice remains: “To those whom most we love to bid adieu, “To witness all the agonizing pains “Of noble hearts warm'd with attachment true: “Doom'd haply ne'er those graces to review— “But let us these soul-rending thoughts dismiss! “The moments we can call our own are few: “These let us wisely consecrate to bliss, “And leave on beauty's lips our last reluctant kiss!” LXXXV The chamber ent'ring, England's Queen they view'd, Who with the Cyprian Maid, tho' wan'd the night, The pleasing labours of her web pursued. There trac'd they Cæsarea's glorious fight, And many a champion brave, and many a knight Seem'd there again his puissant arm to wield: Again was seen the Saracenic flight, Blondel again display'd his succouring shield, And Richard there again shone master of the field. LXXXVI Surpriz'd they left their half-unfinish'd toil, And Berengaria, hast'ning tow'rds the King, Greeted his presence with a heav'nly smile. “Whate'er,” she cried, “my love may hither bring, “He finds us here from time's oblivious wing “Employ'd to save the wonders of his hand. “While poetry thy great exploits shall sing, “And Richard's worth by history shall be scann'd, “By us, more humbly wrought, shall they recorded stand.” LXXXVII “Thou know'st,” replied he, “that no ampler praise “Than thy approval my fond soul requires “Tow'rds fair renown it's energies to raise. “For thee my heart beats high with pure desires, “Thy mild attractive grace my bosom fires “With pure attachment and congenial love. “Yet wayward fate against our joys conspires: “Resistless duty bids me hence remove, “Again for England's sake the chance of war to prove.” LXXXVIII “Ah! what,” exclaim'd she, “now provokes thee hence! “Must then my fond, too-susceptible heart “Be doom'd again to anguish and suspense? “Oh death! in pity here infix thy dart; “Strike deep, and ease at once my tort'ring smart! “Are there no means to ward the threat'ned blow? “Must we again, when scarce united, part? “Ah! must I still augmented torments know, “In wretchedness supreme, sublime in lengthen'd woe!” LXXXIX Weeping she spoke, and tore her auburn hair, Then, with a sigh which seem'd her heart to break, She sank, a silent image of despair. Meantime, while tears suffus'd her blooming cheek, Too much oppress'd by warring thoughts to speak, Fair Chariclæa fat. She rais'd her head, And, struggling to o'ercome the feelings weak Which in her bosom sentiment had bred, Tow'rds the sad Queen advanc'd, and thus with firmness said. XC “Oh Berengaria! who so oft hast brought “Sweet consolation to my troubled soul, “Whose voice, with wisdom's choicest precepts fraught, “O'er my afflicted bosom oft has stole, “And prov'd it's pow'r my sorrows to console, “Let now thy native fortitude be seen. “Superior duties should thy grief controul: “They bid thee danger meet with front serene, “As Richard's spouse becomes, and England's high-born Queen. XCI “Exultingly the glorious truth I prove, “And grateful bow to Heav'n, which deign'd to grace “My favour'd fortunes with a hero's love. “What tho' thro' long antiquity I trace “Th' imperial honours of my vaunted race! “The proud distinction which his choice confers “Beyond all rank or ancestry I place: “To his desert my memory oft recurs, “And all that dignifies the soul to action stirs.” XCII She said. Blondel entranc'd in wonder gaz'd, And thus exclaim'd, as falling at her feet Her hand enraptur'd to his lips he rais'd: “Oh first of women! Excellence compleat! “Ne'er may Blondel thy cherish'd hope defeat! “By future action shall my truth be known; “My heart with thee shall still in concord beat, “When glory and ambitious hope are flown, “And when immortal love shall faithful prove alone!” XCIII “There spoke the lover and the hero too,” The Maid replied: “Proceed, illustrious youth! “Bravely the foes of England to pursue. “If Chariclæa's love thy toils can smooth, “If her affection pure thy cares can sooth, “Let thy endowments fully be reveal'd: “Confiding in thy constancy and truth, “My hand thy sword shall gird, shall rear thy shield, “And my approving voice shall urge thee to the field.” XCIV Then turning to the Queen, “Should we repine,” She cried, “if honour with resistless call “Compel us those we value to resign? “Does it become us misery to forestal, “Or picture woes our senses to appal? “On Heav'n's o'er-watching providence reflect, “Without whose word the sparrow cannot fall: “Think but on this, and then thy force collect “To prop thy weaken'd mind, thy reason to direct. XCV “Nay, weep not, lovely friend! I too could weep, “But, spite of all my tears, the Pow'r above, “Who rules our fate, his fix'd resolve would keep. “He, doubtless our imperfect hearts to prove, “Will oft our transitory joys remove: “'Tis he our heroes' ardour who has fir'd; “He will return them, constant to our love “And blest with all to which their souls aspir'd, “To offer at our feet the meed by worth acquir'd.” XCVI “Could I such pleasing perspectives discern,” Replied the Queen, “I might short sorrows brave: “But they, alas! may never more return!” “If the dark Cypress o'er their tomb should wave,” Cried she, “what nobler trophy can they have, “Than the warm tear which drops from beauty's eye? “Shall we not meet again beyond the grave? “Shall not our mingling souls embrace, and fly “'Midst angel choirs to reap a blest eternity?” XCVII Not less, when on the suff'ring Martyr's head From op'ning Heav'n the holy Spirit fell, O'er his mov'd soul celestial balm it shed, Than wrought her words affliction to dispel. With cheering hope they felt their bosoms swell: In mutual converse and endearments chaste, As if resolv'd intrusive doubt to quell, The short reprieve which time allow'd they pass'd, Entranc'd in pure delight too exquisite to last. XCVIII For now the earliest tint of morning beam'd, And o'er the sky, in night's dark veil yet bound, A grey effulgence from th' horizon stream'd: The shouts of passing troops were heard around, And shrill arose the trumpet's martial sound. “Farewell,” cried Richard, “best belov'd, adieu! “Soon may we meet by fame and victory crown'd! “By Heav'n supported, and inspir'd by you, “Our swords shall make the foe his daring insults rue!” END OF BOOK XVII. BOOK XVIII. ARGUMENT. Engagement between the English and French armies— Philip, wounded by Richard, is conveyed to Gaalor—Complete defeat of the French—Interview between Richard and Philip—Peace—Conclusion. I Now broke the day, and from St. James's height The mists which rob'd it's rugged brow unroll'd, While o'er the vallies linger'd yet the night, And vap'ry dews in domination cold The widely-spreading landscape seem'd t' infold: Thro' them the tow'ring spire and mantling wood Now rose; now, streaming with celestial gold, The sun pour'd forth his animating flood, And all the glorious scene array'd in splendour stood. II Throughout the crouded streets with eager haste The warlike youth in all directions press'd, And tow'rds the gate their march observant trac'd: Far gleam'd each helm, high wav'd each plumed crest, And loudly spoke each Chieftain his behest; The drums and trumpets join'd their cheering sound, And, proudly conscious of their daring quest, The lordly chargers, as they scour'd around, Neighing, their arch'd necks rear'd, and shook the dusty ground. III Richard meantime, attended by Blondel, His visor clos'd, his temper'd cuirass brac'd, While Arthurs's faulchion from his baldrick fell, And his right hand a spear of tough ash grac'd. A golden coronet his helm encas'd, O'er which a heron's plume was seen to float, Shad'wing the gems with which it was enchas'd. O'er his bright armour hung a rich surcoat, With England's bearings charg'd his station to denote. IV Soon as he learn'd that on th' appointed field The Chiefs their various armaments had class'd, He breath'd a pray'r, and grasp'd his ample shield. As to the portal he advanc'd, the last Of his well-order'd troops the barrier pass'd. He leap'd upon his steed, and thro' the gate To join th' assembling force proceeded fast, Confiding in his cause, resign'd to fate, And eager to conclude the long-provok'd debate. V Ere long, attended by his knightly band, He join'd his host, and, as in order close His gallant legions stood, with out-stretch'd hand Thus he address'd them. “Comrades! see your foes: “Think on the duty which a soldier owes “To Heav'n, his country, and his cherish'd fame. “The heart, which with a patriot's ardour glows, “Will prove the force of it's inspiring flame, “And by exertions new will fresh distinction claim. VI “If danger threaten, I the risk partake; “If toils await ye, I the labour share: “My lov'd companions ne'er will I forsake. “Should ye be wounded, mine shall be the care “All that may ease your suff'rings to prepare: “Should ye survive, and fame your deeds should grace, “Henceforth each yeoman shall coat-armour bear, “Shall o'er his gate his blazon'd 'scutcheon place, “And prove the founder proud of an ennobled race. VII “Then live with me, your country's trust and pride, “Or die with me, to honour's dictates true: “My choice is made, whatever may betide, “I live to glory, or I die with you. “But, ere our hearts' bold dictates we pursue, “Let us, with zealous confidence impress'd, “Our humble suit to providence renew: “Then let each warrior bravely rear his crest, “Trust in th' Almighty's aid, and leave to fate the rest.” VIII While England's bands their pious King obey'd, And pure devotion's flame their bosoms caught, Philip within Gaalor's fortress stay'd. A prey to anxious and distracting thought, Successive plans and stratagems he wrought; And, tho' of Belial's potent aid depriv'd, His working fancy new resources sought, And fresh arrangements craftily contriv'd, From which a fleeting ray of comfort he deriv'd. IX Meantime, array'd the Gallic legions stood, While o'er the plain, which either host between Descended gently tow'rds Rapaume's clear flood, The movements of the English bands were seen. The gallant Chiefs delay'd not to convene. To seek the presence of their King they chose Experienc'd Nanteuil and renown'd Sargines, Charg'd to request he would his plans disclose, And at their head appear to lead them 'gainst their foes. X They to Gaalor hast'ning, to the Prince Their suit reveal'd, and urg'd him to repair To his impatient line, and there evince What his great soul in peril's hour could dare. He, still engross'd by heart-corroding care, Ill brook'd their presence and entreaties strong: Yet still renew'd they their persuasions fair, Recall'd the duties which to Kings belong, And press'd him not himself and country thus to wrong. XI “Already, Sire! in burnish'd steel array'd “Richard,” exclaim'd Sargines, “his forces leads: “On high his boastful banner is display'd; “Against our host he daringly proceeds, “And, not unmindful of his former deeds, “By new exertions strives new wreaths to gain. “He no persuasions, no intreaties, needs; “His absence does not England's zeal restrain, “He cheers his comrades' toils, and gives their fury rein.” XII “If,” said the King, “I have remark'd aright, “Thy speech a strange propensity displays “My rival's hated merits to recite, “And, at my cost, invidiously to raise “For England's Prince an edifice of praise. “I would not wish a judgment false to make; “But, if thy tongue thy mind's intent betrays, “'Twere better far thy Monarch to forsake, “And with his deadliest foe an open part to take.” XIII “Heav'ns and ye sacred Pow'rs!” the Chieftain cried, “Are thus my loyalty and well-earn'd fame “By him for whom my blood was shed belied! “Prince! had a man of less illustrious name “At my allegiance thus presum'd to aim, “My biting sword ere this had pierc'd his breast. “Farewell! I go to clear myself from shame: “When next we meet, my worth shall be confess'd, “Or low on earth shall lie my now dishonour'd crest!” XIV Thus saying, from Gaalor's tow'rs he went, And to the army hastily repair'd, Indignant and on desp'rate purpose bent. Philip, who nought for his endurance car'd, His orders issued and his arms prepar'd; Then to Nanteuil, who in amazement lost His friend's resentment and affliction shar'd, “Come on,” he cried, “now forward to the host, “And let yon madman try to realize his boast.” XV “Sire!” said Nanteuil, “a man whose high renown “All Europe owns, it suits not thus to call. “Than him none better will support your crown: “No danger can his valiant heart appal; “He will or honour gain or greatly fall.” “Let him the fulsome praises of my foe, “Which now he dares promulgate, first recal, “Then,” said the King, “I may more def'rence shew: “Now to the crouded field with other thoughts I go.” XVI Across the plain his courser he impell'd, Whose vig'rous efforts soon the Monarch brought To where the Chiefs their anxious council held. Meantime Nanteuil his valiant comrade sought, Who, rack'd with care, their presence heeded nought, But seem'd engag'd some dread intent to scan, While heav'd his bosom with tumultuous thought, And o'er his mind sharp recollections ran. Him brave Nanteuil approach'd, and mildly thus began. XVII “Not less severely than yourself I feel “Our King's unjust reproach: yet still, my friend! “When honour and our country make appeal, “We should to their superior claims attend. “On our exertions Gallia's hopes depend. “Let not thy private feelings intervene, “T' abate the zeal which should her cause defend: “Forget the insults offer'd to Sargines, “And, as becomes thee, first in glory's ranks be seen.” XVIII As thus he said, Sargines with firm aspect Surveying him replied: “Too well I know “Honour's fair claim my duty to neglect. “My heart for France shall never cease to glow, “For her my blood shall ever freely flow; “Unbiass'd by resentment or disgust, “In her defence I only ask to shew, “That, true and faithful to her sacred trust, “Tho' injur'd by my King, to her I still am just. XIX “Yet, not unmindful of my Sov'reign's cause, “A cause to ev'ry gallant Frenchman dear, “To guard his head Sargines shall never pause. “Then may my truth and loyalty appear! “But see! our foes aloft their standards rear: “Mark their close ranks, their menacing array, “Their pealing hymns of warm devotion hear. “Honour and duty call us hence away, “Urge us to meet our fate, and chide our long delay!” XX He said, and hast'ning tow'rds the spreading line, As if forgetful of his recent slight, Sought with Nanteuil th' assembled Chiefs to join, Where Philip, as he rang'd his warlike might, Rode thro' their ranks and stirr'd them to the fight. No longer now he seem'd by doubts oppress'd, But, as if hope with inspiration light And fancied triumphs visited his breast, Thus, as along he pass'd, his legions he address'd. XXI “Warriors! prepare to meet th' eventful hour: “Unite yon vaunting armaments to chase, “Who now so sturdily defy our pow'r. “Like high-born coursers panting for the race, “Fearless of peril, emulously trace “The path which leads to conquest and renown, “And with immortal palms your efforts grace: “Tho' dangers menace, and tho' fortune frown, “Follow where glory leads, and win her deathless crown. XXII “I hail your mounting ardour: give it room, “Nor check it 'till proud Rouen's ramparts yield, “'Till Gallic prowess stamp your foeman's doom! “What tho' yon bands their threat'ning faulchions wield? “Undaunted meet them on the hostile field, “Invite the contest, and their views forestal! “Be now th' unrival'd worth of France reveal'd: “Wave high your swords, aloud St. Denis call, “Assert your country's fame, or in her service fall!” XXIII As thus the Monarch spoke, around burst forth Shouts of wild transport: ev'ry valiant Peer Rejoic'd that now the trial of his worth And the bright harvest of renown were near. Each, as he rear'd his blade and pois'd his spear, No more the ardour of his troop restrain'd, But bad them tow'rds Rapaume their swift march steer, Which now the English bands had almost gain'd. As either line advanc'd, suspense appalling reign'd. XXIV Thus, when in air approaching tempests brood, Hush'd are old ocean's billows, and in sleep Wrapt are the blasts which plough'd it's surface rude: Soon with resistless violence they sweep, And, from the caverns of the foaming deep, Tear the wild waves in mountains to the sky; The rocks re-echo from their bases steep, Amid the gloom quick-glancing light'nings fly, And thunders roll around, and drown the seaman's cry. XXV Vieupont, to whom the guidance of his van The Gallic King had giv'n, in order close His archers led, and first the fight began. “Behold advancing tow'rds Rapaume your foes,” Loudly he cried, “Now bend your sturdy bows, “And let each arrow as it whizzes tell!” Straightway on high an iron show'r arose; But strength it's flight was wanting to impel, Innoxiously it pass'd, and in the river fell. XXVI Not so the yeomanry, whom England's Prince Had station'd in his front, prevail'd to shew Their prowess and their ancient skill t' evince. Their cloth-yard arrows to the head they drew, Which with unerring destination flew, And spread confusion thro' the adverse band. Nor staid they long their volley to renew: Vieupont in vain enforc'd his stern command, His archers fled, their foes unable to withstand. XXVII Indignant to behold their foul mischance, And anxious their misconduct to retrieve, Sabran his forces order'd to advance. “Let us from perils Vieupont's band relieve,” He cried, “let those who triumph now perceive “How Gallia's sons their duty can discharge: “On, my brave comrades! soon shall ye atchieve “The glorious toil; cease not your vig'rous charge, “Till your acknowledg'd worth by vict'ry you enlarge.” XXVIII They heard his pow'rful mandate, and, intent Their friends to succour, his behest obey'd: Tow'rds the Rapaume their eager march they bent, And, as on high their bucklers they display'd, Mock'd the wing'd arrows which against them play'd. Heedless of fate, and prodigal of blood, Tho' England's choicest youth, in steel array'd, Crouding the adverse bank embattled stood, They plung'd amid the waves, and boldly cross'd the flood. XXIX Them follow'd close the band of St. Hilaire; Nor was the troop of Montreal more slow The dangers of the dread assault to share. Urging his squadron's ardour, bold Vitevaux Bad them again their wonted valour shew. Nor less De Marby felt his manly breast With conscious worth and gen'rous feelings glow: To dare the risk his gallant host he press'd, And brandish'd high his spear, and wav'd his plumed crest. XXX Soon they perceiv'd along the river's edge The English archers, long to warfare train'd, Who, forming an impenetrable hedge, A never-ceasing show'r of arrows rain'd, And smote them as the mid-stream they attain'd. Pierc'd by their shafts full many a warrior sank, And with his blood the limpid waters stain'd; Yet still they press'd, regardless of their rank, And following brave Sabran rush'd tow'rds the western bank. XXXI Nor danger's front, nor death itself they fear'd; They rush'd like wolves by thirst of prey impell'd: As fell the foremost, others straight appear'd, And still intrepidly their purpose held, Tho' many a bleeding corse the current swell'd, As England's archers bent their sounding bows. Loud was their cry as they Sabran beheld Surmount the bank. Imperiously he rose, Breathing defiance loud and vengeance on his foes. XXXII Not from th' Ætnean caves the sulph'rous blast With force more horrible is seen to burst. Whoe'er oppos'd his fury he o'ercast, Full many a sturdy warrior he revers'd, Broke thro' their ranks, their armaments dispers'd, And far around him wild confusion spread. All seem'd awhile in wonder lost: none durst Oppose his progress, as, with carnage red, He rang'd across the field, and rode o'er heaps of dead. XXXIII Him Tancarville, inur'd to war perceiv'd. As the strange havock which he wrought around He mark'd, his breast with indignation heav'd: “Can there,” exclaim'd he, “be no champion found, “To face yon warrior thus with conquest crown'd? “Be mine the task his boldness to defeat!” With that his buckler on his arm he bound, Pois'd his good weapon, spurr'd his courser fleet, And hastily advanc'd his puissant foe to meet. XXXIV The Gallic leader saw him as he came, Nor 'gainst him long delay'd his steed to guide. Both lances shiver'd, as, with furious aim, They sought their deadly contest to decide. Grasping their swords, each other they defied; Crush'd were their helms, their polish'd mails were rent, Their rich surcoats with gushing blood were dy'd; Yet, on the issue equally intent, Careless of pain they seem'd, and on destruction bent. XXXV At length the fortune of Sabran prevail'd. Pierc'd where his helmet with his mail combin'd, His bold opponent fell: his eye-sight fail'd; With a brief pray'r, his spirit unconfin'd The honour'd shades of his fore-fathers join'd. For warlike fame illustrious as for birth, Gen'rous as brave, magnanimous as kind, His grateful countrymen confess'd his worth. In their defence he sank, and press'd th' ensanguin'd earth. XXXVI Sabran meantime his vengeful course renew'd; But soon an object his attention caught, Which urg'd him o'er the field. In contest rude With St. Hilaire renown'd Fitz-Gerald fought, Close by the stream: with equal valour fraught And equal skill, the combat they maintain'd; Now hand to hand, and horse to horse, they sought Their blows to deal; doubtful the strife remain'd, And either helm alike with crimson'd streams was stain'd. XXXVII Intrepid St. Hilaire his faulchion whirl'd, When, yielding suddenly the treach'rous bank, He and his steed into the stream were hurl'd: Together in it's foaming waves they sank, And deeply of the turbid current drank. Soon as his friend's mishap Sabran espied, Fiercely he broke the intervening rank, And, as Fitz-Gerald sternly he defied, On his bruis'd casque a stroke with vengeful aim applied. XXXVIII Dauntless the rude aggression he receiv'd; And now between them rag'd the stubborn fight, And either Chieftain deeds of worth atchiev'd, When 'cross the river Brancas led his might: His too successful efforts seem'd t' invite His friend Dumont to follow with his band. Their charge compell'd the English van to flight: Full many a warrior felt their ruthless hand, And many a Chieftain press'd the long-contested strand. XXXIX The field surveying with attentive glance, Blondel their progress mark'd: his gen'rous breast Heav'd, when he saw the lilies pale of France Superbly waving, as their murd'rous quest The foe pursued: “And shall we not arrest “Their course audacious?” loudly he exclaim'd; “If yet, by English virtue unrepress'd, “By patriot feelings are your hearts inflam'd, “On to the charge, nor let your oft-tried worth be sham'd.” XL He said. Tremendous as the God of War, His fatal course the youthful Chieftain held: Like thunder's voice his shout re-echo'd far; His sword the wide-encrimson'd torrent swell'd. In vain against him stout Breteuil impell'd His vig'rous steed: stagg'ring he press'd the ground. Him ne'er again his anxious wife beheld; Encircled with her smiling babes around, Ne'er in her fond embrace her lord again she bound. XLI Him falling Beauplan saw, who erst the fleet Of royal Philip had tow'rds Acre led. Impetuously he rode Blondel to meet. Short was their conflict: on his ill-arm'd head The youthful hero struck with impulse dread: The fortunes of his luckless friend he shar'd, And his freed spirit to attend him fled. Far better had he still the ocean dar'd, And buffetted the waves which oft his bark had spar'd. XLII Him to avenge impetuously Vitevaux The victor Chief assaulted. On his crest Roughly he smote: tho' pow'rful was his blow, The temper'd steel prevail'd it's force t' arrest. His own the prowess of his foe confess'd: The trenchant weapon, cleaving thro' his brain, Stopt not 'till deeply it transfix'd his breast. He dropt his sword, and fell convuls'd with pain, While, to acquire new fame, Blondel rang'd o'er the plain. XLIII Death seem'd to follow him where'er he turn'd: Nor worth, nor numbers, his assault withstood; His vig'rous steed the dead and wounded spurn'd; With woolly fetlocks deeply dy'd in blood Tow'rds the Rapaume his progress he pursued, Where brave Fitz-Gerald and the stern Sabran Engag'd he saw in combat long and rude: Encrimson'd streams from either warrior ran, Each was with toil o'erspent, and each to faint began. XLIV He rush'd impatient to his friend's relief, Who scarcely now his weighty arms could wield, And furiously against the Gallic Chief Turning, he bore him headlong to the field. “Preserve his life,” he cried, “but take his shield, “And him forthwith to England's King convey: “Give him refreshment, let his wounds be heal'd. “A foe, who thus his valour can display, “Our triumph will adorn, and grace this glorious day!” XLV While thus with signal valour on the right Blondel his fame and country's cause maintain'd, Less fav'ring on the left appear'd the fight. There wild confusion and disorder reign'd; De Marby there, with vengeance unrestrain'd, Thro' broken ranks his deadly course impell'd: There bold Brancas, his sword with carnage stain'd, With English gore Rapaume's red current swell'd: There their disastrous rule dismay and terror held. XLVI Ill brook'd De Preaux the suff'rings of his host. “Comrades!” he cried, “redeem this foul disgrace! “Shall your renown, so well acquir'd be lost? “To Gallia's Lilies shall the Cross give place, “And England's banners Philip's triumphs grace? “If yet your souls bright honour's impulse move, “Conquest atchieve, or glorious death embrace!” With that his courser 'gainst Brancas he drove, And loudly dar'd the Chief the brunt of war to prove. XLVII He heard the proud defiance, nor deferr'd In equal arms his summoner to greet: His foaming courser's heaving flank he spurr'd, And hastily advanc'd his foe to meet. Hardly could either Chieftain keep his seat, As on his buckler rung the adverse lance: The potent blows compell'd them to retreat, Yet only with new ardour to advance, As if delay but serv'd their fury to enhance. XLVIII With surer destination now they smote. On Brancas' neck, where his plum'd helmet's bound Join'd with the border of his mailed coat, De Preaux's tough spear infix'd a ghastly wound, While, in his own ill-guarded side, profound, Draining his life-blood, Brancas' lance remain'd. Together fell the warriors to the ground, Their mingled gore the thirsty soil distain'd, Each felt approaching death, yet each his sense retain'd. XLIX Of those, who chanc'd their combat to perceive, A croud approach'd: each, mov'd by pity, vied De Preaux, their lov'd companion, to relieve. He, as to raise him from the earth they tried, With broken voice and dying accents cried, “Ah! cease, my friends! your unavailing care; “Tow'rds me in vain your succour is applied; “Nought now can aid me but your pious pray'r, “That Heav'n's eternal joys my flitting soul may share. L “But, if some spark of animating fire “Within my brave opponent's breast remain, “Ah! let kind pity's touch your hearts inspire: “Bear him in safety from this bloody plain, “Let some kind leech's hand assuage his pain. “Adieu—the veil of death is round me spread— “Shew him the mercy you would hope to gain!—” Thus gasping spake the Chief: he bow'd his head, And, courteous to the last, his gallant spirit fled. LI His mild behest the sorrowing warriors prais'd, And not unwillingly his words obey'd. The Gallic Chieftain, fainting yet, they rais'd: He breath'd, but fast life's vigour seem'd to fade. Him on a shield with tender care they laid, And, with the lifeless body of their friend, With hasty footsteps to the camp convey'd. Meantime, around new shouts were heard t' ascend, Astounding clamours rose, and seem'd Heav'n's arch to rend. LII For bold De Marby urg'd the dread debate. As o'er the field with brandish'd spear he rode, He seem'd the harbinger of ruthless fate: Torrents of English blood around him flow'd; His arm resistless to the dark abode Of disembodied souls their ranks consign'd, And with their lifeless limbs the champaign strew'd. He rag'd amid them, like the midnight wind, Which, as it passes, leaves a ruin'd track behind. LIII Illustrious Chamville and Fierte brave, O'erthrown by him, the debt of nature paid. Nor could his polish'd numbers Beaumont save: He erst, reposing in his native shade, Had fram'd the verse, and sought the Muse's aid To consecrate his gentle lady's bloom. Ah! had he ne'er the voice of war obey'd, She had not prematurely moan'd his doom, Nor had she weeping rear'd his unavailing tomb. LIV Young Chandos, offspring of a worthy sire, Now first in arms the Gallic shore had sought. Early he learn'd to warlike fame t' aspire, And, by his father's bright example taught, The gen'rous flame of patriotism had caught. By feelings high incited and by grief, He view'd the carnage which De Marby wrought, And straightway to his suff'ring friend's relief He rush'd across the plain, and brav'd the vet'ran Chief. LV “Whoe'er thou art,” he cried, “whose pow'rful hand “Thus spreads destruction thro' the bleeding throng, “Behold a youthful Knight who bids thee stand! “Bold in her cause, in conscious duty strong, “Be mine to vindicate my country's wrong!” “To feast and revel in thy father's hall “Better,” replied he, “to thy years belong: “'Twere wiser there to lead the festive ball “With sportive damsels, than unpitied here to fall.” LVI “Should Heav'n my hopes fulfil,” the youth rejoin'd, “From those fair damsels, when again we meet, “I trust a welcome doubly sweet to find: “With transport they my wish'd return will greet, “When thy rich spoils I lay before their feet.” With that, he boldly rode against his foe. The shock made either stagger in his seat: Their lances shiver'd with the furious blow, And 'crimson'd streams were seen from either mail to flow. LVII Quickly their foaming coursers' speed they check'd, And, turning back, their swords impatient drew: Both seem'd their utmost vigour to collect, Intent alike the contest to pursue. Sparks of bright fire from either helmet flew, Bruised were their corselets, their broad bucklers rung; Their stern assault no intermission knew: As each against the other fiercely sprung, The dread event of war in doubtful balance hung. LVIII De Marby's blade his bold opponent's crest Now shatter'd: swiftly wielding it again, With an empurpled tide his 'broider'd vest And scarf wide-flowing it prevail'd to stain. But on his foaming charger's arching mane Chandos infix'd a deep and ghastly wound, The spinal bone dissev'ring: mad with pain, He rear'd, he plung'd awhile, then, wheeling round, He sank, and falling bore his rider to the ground. LIX Beneath his weight De Marby lay oppress'd, When Chandos nimbly leapt upon the field, And, his foot firmly placing on his breast, With exultation cried, “Proud Chieftain, yield! “Confess that youth can manhood's weapons wield! “Now, by those damsels, whom thy boastful taunt “My play-mates made, thy sentence shall be seal'd: “To them thy prowess thou may'st safely vaunt, “But never more attempt a manly heart to daunt.” LX Thus saying, to his 'Squire the Chief he gave, With orders to conduct him to his post, And o'er the plain with freshen'd ardour drave. Doubtful was now the fortune of the host; Assail'd in every quarter, ground they lost, And, tho' Blondel still urg'd them on, gave way: For now new bands of foes the stream had cross'd, Des Brennes his squadron led in stern array, And Mountfort bad his troop their wonted zeal display. LXI While fortune thus was balanc'd, from the height, Where circled by his gallant Peers he stood, The English King survey'd th' uncertain fight. He saw new reinforcements pass the flood, Who mark'd their desolating way with blood: He view'd his warriors ranging o'er the plain, Fearless, and courting the encounter rude, Intent the hostile impulse to restrain, To cheer their broken troops, and fresh renown to gain. LXII But soon another scene his thoughts engag'd. Beyond the river now the Fiend of War, Her vengeful ministers impelling, rag'd. Her voice, of woe prophetic, sounded far; As o'er the field she drove her sanguin'd car, Her hell-born coursers urg'd their progress drear; Portentous like hot Sirius' flaming star, She brandish'd high in air her murd'rous spear, And high her crest begirt with snakes rejoic'd to rear. LXIII There valiant Mortimer his bands led on, And with Des Barres his deadly conflict held: There, as their armour with the sunbeams shone, On either side the gallant Chiefs impell'd Their foaming chargers, and with zeal unquell'd The work of fate intrepidly pursued: Now England's youth in deeds of worth excell'd, Now Gallia's champions their attack renew'd, And all confusion seem'd, and anarchy and blood. LXIV Now Destiny, presiding at her loom, Prepar'd her baleful web of horrors dread. Hov'ring between each host, her dubious plume, Red with promiscuous carnage, Victory spread: Wide flew her gory tresses, as she shed Her glance infuriate o'er the crouded plain, Strew'd far around with wounded and with dead: Woe, Havock and Despair compos'd her train, Exulting to confirm her desolating reign. LXV “On to the proof!” the Monarch loudly cried, “The battle's issue on ourselves depends, “And worth superior must our fate decide. “Comrades! reflect that Heav'n the brave befriends: “Tho' threat'ning ruin on his course attends, “There is a Providence, whose watchful care “Him who asserts his country's cause defends. “Arm'd with this faith, to meet the foe prepare, “Follow where Richard leads, and England's glory share!” LXVI He said. Nor more the gen'rous Chiefs requir'd: Their hearts, which ill the foe's success could bear, With double zeal their Monarch's voice inspir'd. Him Reginald and Lacy follow'd near; Neville, Mauleon, and full many a Peer, Aspir'd with him their oft-tried arms to wield. He at their head, high-brandishing his spear, And firmly grasping his emblazon'd shield, His vig'rous courser spurr'd, and rush'd across the field. LXVII As 'mid the Glacieres, where their frigid throne Eternal frosts and wintry horrors keep, From Furca's icy bulk the boist'rous Rhone Forth bursting roars among the mountains steep; O'er rocky fragments with resistless sweep Foaming he tears, all obstacles o'erthrows, And rolls his ample volume to the deep: So rush'd the King on his presumptuous foes, So fell before him all who dar'd his wrath oppose. LXVIII Soon the dread spot they reach'd, where bold Blondel, And youthful Chandos, with his first essay Elated, strove th' invader to repel. In vain they sought their prowess to display; By force superior driv'n their bands gave way, While many a Chief, who scorn'd ignoble flight, Stretch'd on the plain in death's embraces lay: Des Brennes with ardour new urg'd on the fight, And by success prevail'd new succours to invite. LXIX Him, as across th' ensanguin'd field he rode Spreading around dismay, the King espied. As with indignant rage his bosom glow'd, He hast'ned tow'rds him, and aloud defied Th' insulting Chief the contest to decide. With expectation high his bosom heav'd, As to his challenge boldly he replied: For, flush'd with recent conquest, he conceiv'd He now should crown the feats his valour had atchiev'd. LXX But visionary prov'd his daring hope, Nor could the arm, which had so oft prevail'd To win renown, with England's Monarch cope. Him with resistless fury he assail'd; Thro' his broad buckler and his cuirass mail'd Richard's good lance a ready passage found: The shades of death his closing eyelids veil'd, Life's purple stream fast issued from his wound, Convuls'd the Chieftain sank, and fainting press'd the ground. LXXI Confus'd the foe their leader's fall beheld, And, as amid their late triumphant band The warlike King his courser fleet impell'd, They shrank astounded from his vengeful hand. None could the terrors of his wrath withstand: Where'er he turn'd his desolating might, Were seen the boastful legions to disband, Abandoning the now successless fight, And rushing tow'rds the stream in desultory flight. LXXII Surrounded by his comrades brave he sought Their yielding squadrons: thro' their full concourse Ranging, new deeds of hardihood he wrought. Not more tremendous, from it's unknown source A Comet, urging it's excentric course, Thro' the dark void of trackless space is whirl'd, While suff'ring nature bows beneath it's force, When in it's vortex many a distant world Involv'd in flames is caught and from it's system hurl'd. LXXIII While thus his glorious progress he pursued, Philip, as round he cast his anxious eye, In ev'ry quarter threat'ning ruin view'd. Appall'd he listen'd to the victors' cry, As they their conq'ring banners wav'd on high, And o'er the wide field urg'd their bloody quest. On either hand he saw his legions fly; Bold Mortimer their line disorder'd press'd, While vainly they essay'd his vengeance to arrest. LXXIV For now no longer 'gainst their strenuous foes Renown'd Des Barres his oft-tried warriors led, No more his awe-inspiring voice arose. Him Mortimer had number'd with the dead: Low on the plain with Gallic slaughter red Transfix'd the Champion lay; his gallant soul Releas'd, to Heav'n's eternal joys was fled. No more his legions felt his strong controul; Throughout their broken ranks dismay and terror stole. LXXV Thus dreadful was th' alternative of ill Which Gallia's haughty Potentate dismay'd. As if his stern commission to fulfil, England's exulting Genius far display'd His sounding plumes, and, in Heav'n's wrath array'd, With voice, which harrow'd up his perjur'd breast, Denounc'd revenge for confidence betray'd. Appall'd he stood, by doubts and fears oppress'd: At length arous'd he thus th' attentive Peers address'd. LXXVI “See where harsh fortune on our prospects lours, “Oh mark! where, pleas'd her bitt'rest woes to drain, “Her flood of vengeance she unpitying pours! “On ev'ry side shame and disorder reign! “Tho' weak our struggle, and our efforts vain, “Yet may not fortitude defeat repair? “All is not lost, if Gallic zeal remain! “Let us assume new courage from despair, “And, as becomes us, death or glorious victory share.” LXXVII Thus spake the troubled King: nor on his host, In whose free souls the gen'rous ardour flam'd Which grac'd their lineage, were his dictates lost. “To death or victory!” bold Sargines exclaim'd; “Sprung from the Paladins in history fam'd “For worth and loyalty, their matchless deeds “Ne'er by their brave descendants shall be sham'd. “United follow where our Monarch leads; “He wins immortal fame who for his Sov'reign bleeds!” LXXVIII As when, forth-bursting o'er the eastern hills, Day's splendid orb the distant plains illumes, From ev'ry plant ambrosial dew distils, The spangled meadows breathe renew'd perfumes, And, as successive tints the vale assumes, The tuneful choir, with vigour fresh inspir'd, Carol their strains and spread their waving plumes: So, by new hope and emulation fir'd, To grace their Monarch's cause the Gallic Peers aspir'd. LXXIX The time's hard pressure no debate allow'd; For now, on either hand, their yielding force Beneath the faulchions of their conquerors bow'd. Led by the shouts of war and outcries hoarse Which mark'd brave Mortimer's o'erwhelming course, To meet his fury D'Avalon advanc'd. Across the field o'erspread with many a corse, Once known and valued, as his eye he glanc'd, The rage which fill'd his heart remembrance sad enhanc'd. LXXX Him follow'd Montmorency, potent Chief, With Montolieu, Guerin and D'Euremode, All earnest to insure their friends' relief. 'Mid scenes of carnage gallantly they rode, And, while around them 'crimson'd torrents flow'd, As if t' avenge their comrades lost, the plain With wounded and with dead their lances strew'd. Yet fruitless prov'd their zeal, their ardour vain, Still Mortimer prevail'd his 'vantage to maintain. LXXXI While thus with new exertions rag'd the fight, Philip his vizor clos'd, his shield embrac'd, And follow'd by full many a gallant Knight, The pride and last resource of France, in haste Tow'rds the Rapaume his anxious progress trac'd, Where England's Monarch, master of the field, His routed foes in wild disorder chas'd, Who, to superior force compell'd to yield, Shrinking before his wrath to Heav'n for aid appeal'd. LXXXII But to their perjur'd cause was aid denied: Them to the river's marge, abrupt and steep, England's bold warriors drove. In vain they tried T' escape the terrors of th' ensanguin'd deep. As forc'd by dogs, a flock of tim'rous sheep Gaze on some precipice with doubtful glance, As if afraid t' attempt the dang'rous leap, Soon from the threat'ning crag themselves they lance, Impell'd by present risk to trust to vent'rous chance. LXXXIII So Gallia's legions from the perilous bank, Crouded with dead and wounded, sought the flood. There numbers indiscriminately sank, And stain'd the foaming waters with their blood; While others, buffetting the current rude, Prevail'd to stem the now augmented tide, And, turning on their foes who still pursued, By desperation urg'd their wrath defied, And the dread work of death with vengeful ardour plied. LXXXIV Successless prov'd their hazardous essay: Blondel still hung on their defenceless rear, And forc'd their weaken'd squadrons to give way. Around him, as he brandish'd high his spear, Dismay and terror seem'd their course to steer: Where'er he turn'd his desolating arm, Resistance fruitless prov'd: o'ercome by fear, Those, who so lately spread around alarm, Now sought by instant flight to 'scape impending harm. LXXXV He ceas'd not their tumultuous speed to urge, The trembling fugitives pursuing close Thro' the red current to it's eastern verge, Where Philip, sad spectator of their woes, Indignant stood his progress to oppose. He unappall'd the threat'ning King survey'd, And, as impatient from the bank he rose, Fearless his spear with slaughter stain'd display'd, As if his single arm the battle's fortune sway'd. LXXXVI As when a swain, returning to his fold, Meets an half-famish'd wolf who bears away His cherish'd lamb, with desperation bold His murd'rous purpose he attempts to stay, And snatches from his jaws his helpless prey: So rush'd the King against the youthful Knight. He, no less eager for the noble fray, Turn'd tow'rds him, and, collecting all his might, With graceful confidence address'd him to the fight. LXXXVII Already each had spurr'd his vig'rous steed, And, as they onward rode, the wond'ring host Stood gazing on them with observant heed, Wrapt in suspense, in mute attention lost, When, as the river royal Richard cross'd, Loudly he cried, “Blondel! the strife forbear! “None but myself this enterprize shall boast: “With none this proud occasion will I share, “Nor shall another's brow my rightful laurels wear!” LXXXVIII As thus he said, he reach'd the bloody strand. Blondel his courser check'd in middle space, Obedient to his Sov'reign's high command, While, his renown'd antagonist to face, The Gallic King his circle 'gan to trace. Richard, meantime, advancing thro' the croud With native dignity and manly grace, On his false foe a look of scorn bestow'd, And thus, while beam'd his eye with transport, cried aloud. LXXXIX “Lost as thou art to truth, by treasons stain'd, “Since Heav'n's avenging Pow'r my steps to guide “In equal field to meet thee now has deign'd, “By him thou dar'd to wrong art thou defied. “My just revenge no longer is denied. “Now, if thou can'st, thy faithless life defend: “This hour our deadly contest shall decide, “This hour the triumphs of thy guilt shall end! “May Heav'n, which knows my heart, my rightful cause befriend!” XC “No less delight I feel,” replied the King, “That fortune grants us now to terminate “The deep and settled enmities, which spring “From antient rivalship and jealous hate. “No longer waste those moments in debate, “Which, since in adverse arms oppos'd we meet, “We should to deeds of vengeance consecrate. “Thus to thy heart! May shame and foul defeat “O'erwhelm him who shall first from the assault retreat!” XCI He said, and 'gainst the English Monarch's breast His weapon stoutly bent: shiv'ring it flew In fragments o'er the plain. He from it's rest The useless shaft with indignation threw, And swiftly forth his glitt'ring faulchion drew. Soon as his gen'rous foe the chance perceiv'd, He dropt his spear, and with observance due His good Excalibor on high he heav'd, And his opponent's blow on his broad shield receiv'd. XCII His debt of vengeance soon did he repay. On Philip's ample and emblazon'd shield His blade descending bore the marge away, And drove the sounding fragment to the field. Now both were seen their puissant arms to wield, To strike, to rush, to parry, to retire; Each helm and corselet, as their weapons peal'd, Resounding rung, emitting sparks of fire, While many a sanguine stream proclaim'd their ruthless ire. XCIII Observing his advantage fleet, on high The Gallic King, whirling his sword around, On Richard's crest a blow prevail'd t' apply, And the gold circlet, which his morion bound, Dissev'ring, struck it rudely to the ground. “Now, if kind fate,” he cried, “my efforts aid, “My hand shall thy aspiring hopes confound! “Thus to conclude our strife!” No more he stay'd, But summoning his strength he rear'd his pond'rous blade. XCIV But, tho' astounded by the weighty stroke, England's brave Monarch mark'd his stern intent, And, in his breast as tenfold rage awoke, Heaving Excalibor, a blow he lent, Which, meeting Philip's sword in it's descent, Clove it in twain, and with encounter dread His vizor rudely crush'd: stagg'ring he bent, His hands the reins forsook, he bow'd his head, And o'er his bloodless cheek a mortal paleness spread. XCV Soon as the gallant King his state perceiv'd, “Now shall my perjur'd foe,” he cried, “be seen “Gracing the triumph which my arm atchiev'd!” But, as he turn'd to seize him, bold Sargines, His vig'rous courser spurring, rush'd between. “Thus for my Monarch I my life devote!” Loudly he cried, and with his faulchion keen So sturdily on Richard's cuirass smote, That dented was the steel, and rent his rich surcoat. XCVI With vengeance and disdain his bosom burn'd. Relinquishing his now defenceless foe, Quickly to face th' aggressor fierce he turn'd. Nor was Sargines to meet his fury slow. Dread was their rude encounter: many a blow They gave, and many a harsh return they bore; From either helm and mail began to flow, As fell their potent weapons, streams of gore, And either high-plum'd crest marks of their prowess wore. XCVII Meantime, while thus th' eventful combat rag'd, The anxious Peers who Philip's escort made, Perceiving Richard with Sargines engag'd, Rush'd in a body to their Sov'reign's aid. Him fainting yet upon his steed they laid, And, charging those who to oppose them stood, Far from the field their sacred trust convey'd: Thro' the throng'd croud their desp'rate way they hew'd, And tow'rds Gaalor's walls their progress swift pursued. XCVIII As England's King indignantly beheld The daring efforts of the loyal band, His bosom with unbridled fury swell'd; Like light'ning fell his death-dispensing hand: No more Sargines his onset could withstand; Thro' the steel'd cuirass, where his neck it clasp'd, Deep in his shoulder sank his trenchant brand: Then, as with pain the writhing Chieftain gasp'd, Whirling again his sword, him by the throat he grasp'd. XCIX “Now,” he exclaim'd, “thy bold intrusion rue! “Since thou hast learn'd thy forfeit life to scorn, “Receive the vengeance to thy rashness due!” “Strike!” cried Sargines—“True to my ligeance sworn, “What nobler trophy can my fame adorn? “'Twas mine my King from threat'ning death to save, “By me was Philip from destruction torn! “Again his banner may triumphant wave, “His tear perhaps may grace Sargines' illustrious grave!” C “Thy virtues,” cried the King, “thy gen'rous zeal, “From menac'd vengeance shall thy life reprieve. “While Richard's soul a foe's desert can feel, “Ne'er shall his pow'r of freedom him bereave, “Who dar'd such acts heroic to atchieve, “Who nobly courted death his Prince to save. “Whate'er thy weaken'd state requires receive: “Know that true courtesy respects the brave, “And freely grants the aid which suff'ring worth may crave. CI “And should'st thou, Chieftain! England's Monarch deem “Deserving of thy friendship to partake, “Accept this pledge of his unfeign'd esteem! “Henceforward deign to wear it for his sake! “Let it the memory of this day awake, “And of thy glorious deed!” With that in haste He bad th' attendants from his shoulder take The scarf which Berengaria's hand had trac'd, And on the Champion's arm the precious trophy plac'd. CII “Prince!” cried the Chief, “thy friendship I accept, “And sacred shall this pledge of thy esteem “By him who feels thy excellence be kept. “The royal virtues which around thee beam, “Our age's grace, some future poet's theme”— “Forbear,” exclaim'd the King, “the moments fleet “With mine and England's dearest int'rests teem: “Awhile, brave warrior! from the field retreat; “I go, the task which fate imposes to complete.” CIII The air with clamours of applause was rent, As thus the Monarch spoke. The wounded Knight Was led by Basset to the royal tent, And ready succour found. Meantime, the fight No more uncertain hung: In gen'ral flight The Gallic troops were driv'n across the field. Far from the scene of blood their coursers light Some swiftly bore, while more for grace appeal'd, Abandoning the arms they dar'd no longer wield. CIV Nor did brave Mortimer less surely guide To glorious victory his illustrious band. He seem'd o'er all their movements to preside, And, while he sagely issued his command, Shar'd boldly in the enterprize he plann'd. With such a Chief their ardour to inflame, Nought could the force of Englishmen withstand: Nor shall they, if by valour led, ere shame Their country's fair renown and long recorded fame. CV Confirm'd were now the fortunes of the day: Victory on high to her loud tube gave breath, Rejoic'd her Richard's triumphs to display, While, on his brow she plac'd her blooming wreath. Now 'gan the English Chiefs their faulchions sheath, And ev'ry heart with fond presages beat, That once again, their native shades beneath, They should their fond and lovely partners meet, And pure affection's vows with ecstasy repeat. CVI With loud acclaim their valiant King they hail'd, And o'er the plain with Gallic slaughter strew'd Wild exultation and delight prevail'd. Richard well-pleas'd their gen'rous impulse view'd, “Comrades,” aloud he cried, “to end our feud “But little now remains: if fortune smile, “The path of glory still should be pursued: “One effort more will crown our worthy toil, “And proud pre-eminence shall grace our favour'd isle.” CVII He said. New hope each warrior's eye illum'd, And, by their Monarch's bright example cheer'd, Their march tow'rds proud Gaalor they resum'd; Throughout the host exulting shouts were heard, And England's conq'ring standard high was rear'd. Now near at hand the wide embattled wall, Frowning in rude magnificence, appear'd: Nought could it's strength their ardent souls appal; From perils new they seem'd fresh glory to forestal. CVIII And soon, drawn forth in menacing array, They 'gan the Catapultas huge to bend, Their dread artill'ry on the tow'rs to play: Now, thro' the yielding air compell'd t' ascend, Fragments of rocks the fortress seem'd to rend; Now, as replenish'd, groan'd each huge machine, A show'r destructive they combin'd to blend, When from the portal with submissive mien, Waving his flag of truce, Mountjoy was issuing seen. CIX “Cease your assault,” exclaim'd th' expecting King, “'Till yonder harbinger of peace declare, “What terms his Prince commissions him to bring.” Mountjoy meantime advanc'd with sorrowing air; His hasten'd step betoken'd anxious care, And silent was his progress thro' the croud. When near approach'd, with reverences fair, Precursors of his humble suit, he bow'd, Then his entrusted charge he thus proclaim'd aloud. CX “Once more I come this presence high to greet. “My Sov'reign and his Peers thy puissance own, “And on these terms by me propose to treat. “Normannia shall confess thy sway alone; “France shall redeem the pris'ners thou hast won: “If other grievances shall still remain, “From ancient feuds or recent errors grown, “These they propose in future to explain, “That henceforth either state may amity maintain.” CXI “Mountjoy!” replied the King, “this answer take. “Tell him who sent thee, that a conquer'd foe “Has small pretence such haughty terms to make. “Yonder proud fortress shall be levell'd low, “Ere England will her rightful claims forego. “Let him come forth: by us shall be discuss'd “What I shall then propose. Let Philip know “To Richard's honour he may safely trust, “Who ne'er, when once his faith was plighted, prov'd unjust.” CXII He said. Mountjoy withdrew impress'd with awe: Nor in suspense did Richard long await. Surrounded by his faithful Chiefs he saw The Gallic Prince descending from the gate. Confus'd he seem'd, and, as if adverse fate Had bow'd his spirit, downcast was his look; Yet still his eye beam'd with disdain and hate. Unus'd submission and disgrace to brook, As on he came his limbs with conscious feelings shook. CXIII Him thus affected as the King survey'd, The scorn which fill'd his bosom he suppress'd, And pity his resentment stern allay'd, As thus his vanquish'd rival he address'd. “If yet thy haughty and unfeeling breast “A sentiment of loyal truth retain, “Sufficiently thy fortunes are depress'd. “The recollection of the crimes, which stain “Thy once unsullied fame, must wring thy soul with pain.” CXIV “'Twere bootless thy offences to repeat, “Nor shall thy perj'ries now by me be scann'd. “Heav'n has o'erpaid them all by thy defeat. “Thus, when chastis'd by my avenging hand, “To see thee here in patient suppliance stand, “To hear thee terms of clemency implore “On this long harrass'd and insulted strand, “Amply my wounded dignity restore: “They heal my wrongs, and as a Man I ask no more. CXV “But as a King, as he whom Heav'n's high will “Has call'd o'er favour'd Albion to preside, “The duties of my charge I must fulfil. “When first with thee in sacred bonds allied “I sought my host 'gainst Saladin to guide, “Thy dereliction Judah's cause betray'd: “Urg'd by ambition, jealousy and pride, “Against thy friend thy banners were display'd, “And my rash confidence with treach'ry was repaid. CXVI “When I remain'd in Palestine employ'd, “My sworn Ally his bands against me led. “This unsuspecting province they destroy'd: “With Norman gore their impious swords were red, “And Gallic vengeance on her entrails fed. “Nor less was England doom'd thy rage to bear. “There curs'd rebellion's toils by thee were spread, “By thee was John seduc'd thy guilt to share, “To stain with blood the land which nature bad him spare. CXVII “Now heav'nly justice overtakes thy crime, “And proves, tho' treason may a while pursue “It's prosp'rous course, that come there will a time, “When retribution, with atonement due, “Shall make the traitor his offences rue. “Such is thy fallen state: and, if my soul “Like thine no guide but mad ambition knew, “If mercy could not my revenge controul, “I might to their extent repay thy perj'ries foul. CXVIII “But thus I call thee to redeem thy guilt. “By pray'r and penitence Heav'n's grace implore, “To pardon all the Christian blood th' hast spilt: “Let Normandy confess my sway once more; “Her injur'd people's property restore; “For all thy captive warriors ransom yield; “Surrender those who arms against thee bore; “Twelve hostages, who best their swords can wield, “Deliver to my hand when our compact is seal'd. CXIX “Such are the terms of safety and redress, “To which, tho' victor, I myself confine. “Say, in these proffers wilt thou acquiesce? “To name them by the fate of war is mine, “To deem them just and courteous should be thine. “Tho' further might I conquest's rights improve, “I would not on severity refine; “Nor shall the Prince, who once possess'd my love, “When adverse fortune lours, unroyal treatment prove.” CXX As thus impressively the Monarch spoke, The Gallic King, confus'd, essay'd to hide The feelings which within his breast awoke. Silent awhile he stood, and vainly tried To check the rising sigh, then thus replied. “Howe'er disaster may my mind oppress, “Tho' harsh th' avowal to my wounded pride, “I must thy princely courtesy confess, “Which with new charms has pow'r e'en virtue's self to dress. CXXI “To err is human: least of all is he, “On whose ill-fated brow a crown is plac'd, “From risk secure or from temptation free; “Truth from his presence is by flatt'ry chas'd, “By adulation is his soul debas'd, “And servile parasites beset his throne. “Too freely did I of their poisons taste: “Tho' born for others, for myself alone “I learn'd to live, and deem'd all excellence my own. CXXII “Thus, amid scenes which warp'd my judgment bred, “Ambition open'd her enticing views: “I follow'd as the gay deceiver led, “While she, my yielding senses to abuse, “With new-born hope prevail'd my mind t' amuse. “But, while I freely thus my faults confess, “I mean not my transgressions to excuse: “It suits me more those feelings to express, “Which thy acknowledg'd wrongs impel me to redress. CXXIII “The terms, on which thou hast propos'd to treat, “Are such as well our present state become, “And such as my entire concurrence meet. “Let us once more our ancient league resume, “Ah! may again in pristine vigour bloom “The friendship which congenial spirits claim: “And may the Pow'r, who regulates our doom, “Grant that, restor'd to lustre, Philip's name “'Mid Gallia's Kings may stand immortaliz'd by fame.” CXXIV “Thus then,” cried Richard, “let our discord end! “Thus my late rival in my arms I bind, “And hail him, as of old, my valued friend! “Henceforward prove to virtue's laws resign'd, “And me of wrongs forgetful shalt thou find. “Shew thyself worthy of thy sacred trust, “And future ages, to thy errors blind, “But to thy merits and perfections just, “With eulogies shall grace thy venerated bust.” CXXV As smiling Peace thus chas'd the Fiend of War, The gallant warriors nature's voice obey'd, And shouts of glad acclaim resounded far. Soon did they Rouen's battlements pervade. No terrors now fond Berengaria stay'd: Her victor Richard once again to greet, With vet'ran Leicester and the Cyprian Maid Across the plain she urg'd her progress fleet, While with unbounded joy her heart exulting beat. CXXVI As she approach'd, the echoing trumpet's sound Announc'd 'twixt France and England firm accord. “Oh Richard!” she exclaim'd, “by conquest crown'd, “Art thou once more to my fond arms restor'd! “What greater bliss can providence afford, “Than thus again to press thee to my heart? “Thanks to high Heav'n, which I so oft implor'd, “When torn my breast with agonizing smart, “That now indeed we meet never again to part. CXXVII “My life! my love!” th' enraptur'd King replied, “Partake my triumphs and my transport share! “No more shall fate our constant souls divide! “No more shall war's dread clamours rend the air, “Or mad ambition scatter wide despair. “Now my long harrass'd realm, redeem'd from woe, “Again shall feel it's King's paternal care: “Again my subjects happiness shall know, “And ev'ry face shall smile, and ev'ry bosom glow. CXXVIII “And ye, brave guardians of our native isle! “Who oft in peril's front have glory sought, “Reap the full harvest of your gen'rous toil! “Renown is your's, by knightly prowess wrought: “By your example shall our sons be taught “That virtue will felicity insure. “Like their bold sires with patriot ardour fraught, “May they preserve their faith and honour pure! “Then to remotest time shall England's fame endure! CXXIX “And thou, Blondel! my lov'd, my valued friend! “Let Chariclæa's hand thy worth repay: “May blessings on your nuptial torch attend, “And chaste delights which never can decay. “Now with devotion consecrate this day, “Then to old England be our course address'd. “There, while our conq'ring banners we display, “Beneath our well-earn'd laurels let us rest, “Grac'd by the world's applause, by Heav'n's protection bless'd.” CXXX Thus spoke the gallant King, and o'er the plain, With mien majestic and commanding grace, To Rouen's ramparts led his martial train. Sublime he seem'd, as, when fresh breezes chase The envious clouds which hid his glorious face, The Sun, in full meridian lustre bright, Is seen thro' Heav'n's wide field his course to trace, When nature's pow'rs his genial beams incite, And all creation glows with rapture and delight.
