      <field name="fulltext">IN COMMENDATION, OF THE NOBEL GEORGETTA, de Montenay, And her Emblemata. Great wonder is, to the world, If it be so, as niew and ould, Clarkes doe write, for a certayne, Such as is happnet in former time; That the originall of Pallas, Out of the brayne Iupiter was, And the Iuno bracht fort Heben, So soon she Lettice, had eaten; Such lyke ar fables, as I beleeve, To which no man shal credid give: But this is true, as it can tel, France, and Navarræ, very well, That the Noble, wise, and fine, Georgetta de Montenay Hes Hundered godly Emblemes, Elabourated, out of her braynes; Wher former age, regarded not thier need, Before all others, shee hes don the deed. Lyke wise her Picture, standes hir behinde, Torne some leaves, so shalt thou finde; In our tongve, she is now besould, And wished blessing manifould, Vs English men, of God omnipotent, Therefore let vs such a present Embrace, and love, so long wee live. An her for such, much thankes give; Than they will showe vs very playne, What wee shal doe, or refrayne, In this World, of that wee may, Finde before God, grace one day: For in them is, the scripture all, So wisli, breefe, and artificiall, Of our God, declared in brasse, Which doe all others, overpasse. Therefore thou Nobel, Georgetta, Heave thank, for thein Emblemata, Delyke will doe, the whole Europe, To thy alwayes, as I hope. With prayse begin, so thus with thee I end: Praying for those, that doe thy prayse extend, I. H.The verse is explanatory of the emblems. I. [See rohat a holy, and good intent] See rohat a holy, and good intent, Thus perform, this Queene prudent; In bilding a Tempel, so fein and large, To which no labour, time or charge, See sperd; Wherin so well poor as rich, Shall goe to pray, all in such; To God, and their Savier stil, Which sevs them from all Il. II. [To kill thy selfe, and so depart] To kill thy selfe, and so depart, Aut of this world, it is no art; But to rise, and live agein? Thou art not able it is certain; Of ty self, but must like e stone, Lye, til Iesus Creist, Gods Sonne; Koms: For nun but he can cur thein wound Or make thy reis from the graund. III. [This lively spring, thus help all them] This lively spring, thus help all them, Such as be bleind, sick or lem, But the natur of man, if given stil, To lev that good, and folow Il; For such if seen of poor and rich, How they alon, run after such; And no ster reflex, they ins at all, But sences alon, like a bestiall. IV. [See horo this Death, which lookes so wan] See horo this Death, which lookes so wan, Is watch full stil, til shee a maa, Thus catch in her deadly sling, No mater if he be, Princ or king; Therefore ye men consider well, An take this for a Exampel, That ye alway herit patientley, When God that yoke thus opon you lye. V. [Leike as the Magnet that Iron thus] Leike as the Magnet that Iron thus, Draw to him, and neuer refus; So thus Creist, aur sauier deare, Al such, which him truly fier; And brings them, to his Father sweet, Wher all the angels they shall meet; For non but he, kan vs in to that pleas, Help: Aut of this misery and distresse. VI. [The whole world, was most wiketley] The whole world, was most wiketley, With sinne, Satan and miserey Opprest hard, so that no man could, Mek him free of them, when he would, Til Iesus Creist tru God and man, Kam, and trad the sinne, and Satan, Vnder his feet; for perpetuall And so by him, we war freed all. VII. [This wolves, and ravens, they would so fein] This wolves, and ravens, they would so fein, Kindil a fyre, But, it is in vayne, For Iesus Creist, that lifly tree, Thus quenc aut such, as one may see. With his blood so red, for aur sek, That we of such no harm should take; Therefore, let them doo what they will, Their fyre shall, never Kindil. VIII. [Creist is the graund, opon which shall] Creist is the graund, opon which shall, Every Cristian continuall; Bild, and set his hart alon, That time he lives, has he won, A ples of glory, which Creist for all, Such hes preparet, from Eternall; To enioy, when they doo goe, Aut of this miserei and woe. IX. [All trees ar igudget, by ther fruits stil] All trees ar igudget, by ther fruits stil, If they ar good, or Il; For, wher is a bad and wiket ground, Ther ar the fruits, never saund; The leicke one shall, know a mans hart, If he thus looke his dids at, Than wer is a tru, and saund belif, Ther is also a godly lyfe. X. [Kurst is he, which for hilp thus flye] Kurst is he, which for hilp thus flye, To mortal men, and not onley, To God; and his well belovet sonne, From which koms all benediction, But happy is he, that hes in Creist his confidence Set alon, he shall be in his presence, Wher is no chainging, no fall, no il, But alon, heavenly glory stil. XI. [Like as this ship, which is but low] Like as this ship, which is but low, Thus through, all danger goe, No kerit takes, that the windes with might, Doo rage and blow, all day and neight, But derevtley his kors takes to the starr, Which shineth so bright aver all; So shud a man, to God, and truth alwayes, Runn, and not to Satan, or wordly lyes. XII. [If thou disirest the heavenly geat] If thou disirest the heavenly geat, See and feind, so must thou queit, Versek all riches, and thein Land, And take a pilgrims staffe in Hand, Than such is knowen for a certaine, That one trauayles and seekes in vaine, If he not first, his wordly pride, For ever from him layd a side. XIII. [I kan thy help, and from danger sev] I kan thy help, and from danger sev, So spealis aur God, if I thy hef, Therefore so kom, and be not ferd at all, I hould thy fast, thou canst not fall, In to that Gulfe, which vnder thy, Thus fall and maunt, very hye; But they alon, that wil obtein, With aut my, that Paradise so fein. XIV. [See how this bor with a bentit bowe] See how this bor with a bentit bowe, Thus stand and shuts his arowe, Ageinst that anuil, of steel so thick, Opon which they all brek so quik, So thus aur God, from his enemyes, Defend his word, and church alwayes, In this world, and bringes them all, To fall and shame continuall. XV. [Leik as the pipkens torn all] Leik as the pipkens torn all, So well the great as the small, In the sunne: if they doo long, In it stand, so hard and strong; So thus the hart of men obdur, The rich aswel, as the poor, In this World in sinn, and vaniti, In pride, lyes, and iniquiti. XVI. [That Reven which flyes, in the ayre alone] That Reven which flyes, in the ayre alone, Did Cast a nut opon a stone, Which did break in pises very small; That skes a bit could at all, Be faund of it; so wil God alway, Pull daun all them, that will so hey, Maunt and kleim, stil in their pride, Which by no Miens he can abeyde. XVII. [Looke how this claun, the spors kickes] Looke how this claun, the spors kickes, Til he him self, in them prickes, But so soon as he feeleth, it did eake, From them he quikly a runn did take; So ar we mortal in this World, Apt stil to be stobern and bould, Ageinst aur God omnipotent, Til we doo fil his punishement. XVIII. [A Spliter thou wilt drawe aut of meine eye] A Spliter thou wilt drawe aut of meine eye, But see, for thein thus a Tymerlay, Therefore I pray, doo not molest my more, But help thy self, of thein before, Lykeweise wil manny wher is the Gospel tath Com an speak, you goe rong path, To heaven, alon we can show you the same, But the Satan may goe with all them. XIX. [Yee migthi Kings, and Princes all] Yee migthi Kings, and Princes all, Consider, that you ar mortall, And the thinges, in which you plesur taks, God can and will, soon to noting make. Therefore doo not, the poor opresse, But help them stil, in ther distresse, Els will the Death ageinst you vse, Her sworde, if you them abuse. XX. [A King that hes great contryes to rul] A King that hes great contryes to rul, He mus indeed be steylful, Deleyk his consel, and iudgefall, In his Kingdom averall; Els is the contry, not gouernt well, If they in lernig doo not excell, But ar to comper, un to this brute, Which hes a trompet, and cannot stutte. XXI. [Behold what kraft, thus vse this Owle] Behold what kraft, thus vse this Owle, To git aut the lamp that Oyle, Because, shee shinet by day and neight Which thus hinder her, in heer fleeght Therefore, shee vset the hand of man, To steale aut such how shee can, So thus the Satan, and the wiket stil To quenc that good, and sett forth Il. XXII. [This is the Deuills mesenger] This is the Deuills mesenger, Which Creistes gospel wil hinder, In this World, wher he can, And plant the lyes, of Satan, Ageinst such all, we shal resist, For loue aur sauiour Creist, So long we liu in this World, That wil obscur his holy word. XXIII. [The wiket men of Babylon] The wiket men of Babylon, They did bild a towre, heig and strong, For to sev them for all calamitie, Such as dweleth in the cittie But God did such, with winde, and fire, Destroy ageinst their disire, Because they would not trust in him, But alon in their strong bilding. XXIV. [That hors is plegd of the bees and flys] That hors is plegd of the bees and flys, Which doo sitt opon his carcase alwayes That makes him runn continuall, Because he thinkes to loos them all, But let him runn woder he wil, They shal flee abaut him stil, So ar the wiket of their Concient alway Pricket, so well by neight as by day. XXV. [Theyer outwarde habit, is holy and good] Theyer outwarde habit, is holy and good, The tong so meek, and so smood, But see her hart is great way beheind, Reson of this, I cannot feind; Alon, that theyer religion thus requeir And with ernest, such thus desire But God wil the tong, hart and meind Togider hef, if one wil him feind. XXVI. [This man thus vse his cruwelty] This man thus vse his cruwelty, Ageinst that boy, that thus lye, Innocent and naked, opon the ground, But see he mus, feel selfe the wound, This is the end, and reward, Of all such tyranth, that not regarde, Theyer God, but stil delight, In cruwelty, by day and neight. XXVII. [So difficult, as is for a Camell] So difficult, as is for a Camell, Creist speaks in his gespell To goe through the needle of eye, So is for rich men when they die, Enter in to that kingdome of heaven, Because they did alwayes runn, In this World after Mamon And versook God, and his sonne. XXVIII. [I wonder that this lambe may goe] I wonder that this lambe may goe, To the lyons which do ror an blow, To dewour it if they war but free, But they can not, vse such iniquitie, Lyke wise would the wiket, if God did permit, Kill, and spoyl wher they taht war fit, But God keeps them by a bridel stil, To goe no forder, but woder he wil. XXIX. [Is this not a wiket Man?] Is this not a wiket Man? To seru God, and Satan, Both with one harte so stedfast, That he not should at last Versek God, and to Satan flee Ar one may see, so plainly How he to Satan with his harte, Kniels, and from him wil not part. XXX. [God ruls and keeps the hartes of Kinges.] God ruls and keeps the hartes of Kinges. And besid all other thinges, Therefore, if thou wilt God vergit, And to them thy onely submit, So wil God thy pleg with miseri, So long that thou him thus obey, And see that he is the Lord indeed, Which alon, helps thy in all need. XXXI. [When Fortun is alwayes with thy] When Fortun is alwayes with thy, So kanst thou laf merily, But if shee heids her, for a litel weyl, So thust thou, lament an cry, Than schoulds thou, with thy remember stil, That God somtimes crasses wil, Send, to see if thou wilt by him stik When he thy thus litle prick. XXXII. [God thus desire, of us all] God thus desire, of us all, In Loue, and Peace, liue continual And not delight in contention, As Satan thus, but in vnion; Therefore, if thou louest thein God stil, So dost thou knowe what he will, That not shalt make, anger and strife, In all that time of thy lyfe. XXXIII.
