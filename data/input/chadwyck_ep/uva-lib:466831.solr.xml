      <field name="fulltext">RANOLF AND AMOHIA: A DREAM OF TWO LIVES. VOLUME I. PRELUDE. ???? ? ?????—??????. Plato: Phædo, 145. 1 Well! if Truth be all welcomed with hardy reliance, All the lovely unfoldings of luminous Science, All that Logic can prove or disprove be avowed: Is there room for no faith—though such Evil intrude— In the dominance still of a Spirit of Good? Is there room for no hope—such a handbreadth we scan— In the permanence yet of the Spirit of Man?— May we bless the far seeker, nor blame the fine dreamer? Leave Reason her radiance—Doubt her due cloud; Nor their Rainbows enshroud?— 2 From our Life of realities—hard—shallow-hearted, Has Romance—has all glory idyllic departed— From the workaday World all the wonderment flown? Well, but what if there gleamed, in an Age cold as this, The divinest of Poets' ideal of bliss? Yea, an Eden could lurk in this Empire of ours, With the loneliest love in the loveliest bowers?— In an era so rapid with railway and steamer, And with Pan and the Dryads like Raphäel gone— What if this could be shown? 3 O my friends, never deaf to the charms of Denial, Were its comfortless comforting worth a life-trial— Discontented content with a chilling despair?— Better ask as we float down a song-flood unchecked, If our Sky with no Iris be glory-bedecked? Through the gloom of eclipse as we wistfully steal If no darkling auréolar rays may reveal That the Future is haply not utterly cheerless: While the Present has joy and adventure as rare As the Past when most fair? 4 And if weary of mists you will roam undisdaining To a land where the fanciful fountains are raining Swift brilliants of boiling and beautiful spray In the violet splendour of skies that illume Such a wealth of green ferns and rare crimson tree-bloom; Where a people primeval is vanishing fast, With its faiths and its fables and ways of the past: O with reason and fancy unfettered and fearless, Come plunge with us deep into regions of Day— Come away—and away!— NOTE.—Words in the Maori language occurring in the following poem, should be pronounced precisely like Italian; and the double letter ‘ng’ like the softer nasal sound of the same letters in English. Thus ‘Maori’ is pronounced so as to rhyme with ‘dowry,’ with an indication, however, both of the ‘a’ and the ‘o’; and ‘Tangi,’ with ‘slangy’ (if there be such a word in English). The reader is requested to pronounce ‘Amohia’ with the accent on the penultimate, ‘Amohia. BOOK THE FIRST. THE SAILOR-STUDENT. Canto the First. The Sea-boy. 1. Ranolf's childhood. 2. He goes to Sea. 3–5. Sea-life. Night-sailing. Trade-winds. A breeze aft. A squall. The whale. 6. Reefing topsails. The sprung jibboom. 7.

Where hardy Seamen mix with Mountaineers As hardy at the extreme of Britain's isle;— Where rugged Capes confront the Arctic sky, Now faint beneath the pale and tender smile Of summer's lingering light that sadly cheers; Now through rent chasms of the storm-cloud's pile Seen lurking lone in grim obscurity;— Where whirlpools boil, and eddying currents scar The tides that sweeping from the Atlantic far In finest season at their gentlest flow Swarm up a thousand rocks, shoot high in air— Columns of cloud a moment towering clear— Then sink at once plumb-down and disappear; While all the shining rocksides, black and bare, Are streaked with skeiny streams of hurrying snow Like stormers beaten back that headlong go;— Where, sparely bright with scant sheep-speckled grass, Sleep wastes of purple heather and brown morass;— There did young Ranolf a glad childhood pass. For ages had his rough sea-faring race Hailed from a home, though scarce a dwelling-place, Where Devon's cliffs show ruddiest red between Sap-saturated trees of greenest green. They were indeed an Ocean-haunting brood, Brine-breasting till it seemed their very blood Ran pulsing with the spirit of the Sea, As restless and exuberant and free! His Father, with that Ocean-love uncloyed, A lovelier smile than Ocean's had decoyed From roving raptures of its wide wild life— Sheet-anchored to the shore by Child and Wife. Her and this youngling and two born before, Roaming in quest of means to roam no more, To that far northern port at last he bore: There swallowed down his sailor-scorn of trade; And something more than competence had made From calcined kelp, and that free-splitting stone Which in sea-depths or silent cliffs, unknown Ten thousand centuries, unquarried lay Stored up and fashioning for the future beat And ceaseless tramp of busy millions' feet In that enormous World-Mart far away; But most from fisheries, filling all the bays With ruddy shifting sails in sun or haze, When rippling loud, with myriad gleam and glance And rustling shiver o'er its wide expanse, The liquid mass of seething Ocean seemed Quickened to silvery life that one way streamed. II. Such sights and sounds inspired the growing Boy With wondering exultation; and the joy Of deeper thought and loftier feeling lent To the mere gladness of temperament. But books and fancy and old fishers' tales Of glorious climes beyond these mists and gales Kept his young heart too restlessly alive With impulses resistless, such as drive That insect-dragon scaly-winged to strive And struggle through his chasmed channel's mud, And reckless dash into the splendour-flood, The new wide pool of light he feels and sees; Such longings, as, when Summer's searching heats Find out the butterflies in their retreats, They yearn with, till, unvexed by any breeze, The velvet-winged ones at her sweet command, Sole, or in slow-revolving twos and threes, Float in a crimson flutter through the land. Thus the Boy fevered till his sire's consent He gained to gratify his natural bent Towards sailor life, and follow o'er the main, Although the favourite son, his brethren twain. So, freed from schools and tasks, all hopeful glee, Away he went at twelve years old to Sea. III. But what preceptor like the mighty Ocean To kindle thought and manifold emotion? Majestic in its every form, Stupendous calm or terror of the storm; For ever to the dullest sense A symbol of Omnipotence; Yet like that Oriental notion, That Deity of old devotion, Omnipotence so lightly roused to ire, And fickle as a flame of fire. And with this fierce Sublimity, despite The terrors of its treacherous might, Its ruthless rage or sleek perfidious play, As 'twere with some tremendous beast of prey Half-tamed, the Sailor lives from day to day, Lives cautiously familiar, hour by watchful hour For ever in its presence—in its power. But what a hardy pride his bosom warms The while he runs the gauntlet through the storms, Playing with such a foe in wary strife A match whereof the forfeit is his life, The gain, more than his own, another's pelf; With such apparent odds against himself, The seeming desperation of the game Hardens the coarser soul it cannot tame Into a blind oblivion of the morrow, A stoic mirth that laughs at vice and sorrow. While he of nobler mind and loftier aim Is nursed by consciousness of danger, still Escaped by foresight or subdued by skill, Into a calm unboastful strength of will, A sober self-reliance, firm and grave; And feels as o'er vast Ocean's baffled wave Triumphantly he steers from clime to clime Elate with something of its own sublime. IV. And many a vacant hour, on many a theme, Our thoughtful Sea-boy found to muse or dream; Those vigils which the sailor needs must keep In the sky-girt seclusion of the Deep. Oft when the playful billows, lightly curled, Run past the ship, and quiet seems as sleep, The lone retreat that roams about the world— That white-winged monastery moving still Of rugged celibates against their will. Or when in darkness, towards her goal unseen, On moonless midnights mournfully serene, She seems, as by some instinct, self-inspired, Still pressing on her eager quest untired; While, the obscurely-branching clouds between, Crossed stays and braces—silent rocking spars Seem mingling dimly with the dancing stars! Or when, if steady-breathing trade-winds blow, No shift of sails for days required, the crew About the deck their quiet tasks pursue; The heavy-dragging sail with rough-skilled hands They patch, or splice the rope's stiff-plaited strands, Or twirl with balanced backward steps and slow The whizzing yarn, still pondering as they go The long-drawn tale it types of blended joy and woe. Or when, her topsails squared, with plunging ease, The ship goes reeling right before the breeze; And he who has the watch, relaxing now, May lean and mark, with thoughts far elsewhere, how The bowsprit weaves great circles on the sky— Down sinks the deck with all its life—up fly The wide horizon and dark Ocean's plain; And then the buoyant deck ascends again: While speeding after, ever and anon, A huge blue watery hill comes roaring on, Tiger-like, open-mouthed, in furious chase; But near the flying stern with slackened pace, And lowered crest, seems first disposed to see What the strange winged Leviathan may be That dares amid these boisterous brawlers stray; And, fearful the encounter to essay, Falls back in a broad burst of foam, and hissing slinks away. V. No lack of change each feeling to employ! How his eyes widened with a solemn joy When on some witching night The jutting corner of the gibbous Moon— A golden buoy That weltered in a sable sea of cloud (One level mass extending wide, The firmament all bare beside)— Shed an obscure and ominous light, And fitful gusts scarce dared to moan aloud! How was the heart-leap of his exultation Sustained—sublimed by thrilled imagination When, if a storm came veiling all the noon, Old Ocean, rising in gigantic play, Marshalled his multitudinous array Of waves tumultuous into ridges gray, And sent them whirling on their headlong way, Host after host of crested cavalry Charging in lines illimitable (urged By trumpet winds whose deafening bray Drowned the sharp hiss of myriad-lancing spray) Into the horrible white gloom profound That gathered, thickened all around! And when the dimness of the squall was gone, Haply, to some far region bound, The great whale went majestically by— Plunging along his mighty course alone, Into the watery waste unknown; Cleaving with calm, deliberate speed, The battling waves he would not heed; While at long intervals upthrown Successive jets of spouted brine, Decreasing with the distance, in a line, Told how he ne'er diverged An instant from his haughty path Into the black heart of the tempest's wrath That like dense smoke before him scowled, For all the clamorous coil of winds that howled And waves that leapt around him as he past And flung his foamy banner to the blast. VI. Two scraps of boyish letters here may be Thrown in, as roughly written home from sea. “A noble sport—and my delight That reefing topsails! just to make all right, Ere the wind freshens to a gale at night. See! clambering nimbly up the shrouds, Go, thick as bees, the sailor-crowds; The smartest for the post of honour vie That weather yardarm pointing to the sky: They gather at the topmast-head And dark against the darkling cloud Sidling along the foot-ropes spread: Dim figures o'er the yardarm bowed, How with the furious Sail, a glorious sight, Up in the darkness of the Sky they fight! While by the fierce encounter troubled The heavy pitching of the Ship is doubled; The big Sail's swelling, surging volumes, full Of wind, the strong reef-tackle half restrains; And like some lasso-tangled bull Checked in its mid career of savage might O'er far La Plata's plains, It raves and tugs and plunges to get free And flaps and bellows in its agony! But slowly yielding to its scarce-seen foes Faint and more faint its frenzied struggling grows; Till, by its frantic rage at length Exhausted, like that desert-ranger's strength, Silent and still, it seems to shrink and close. Then, tight comprest, the reef-points firmly tied, Down to the deck again the sailors glide; And easier now, with calm concentred force, The Ship bounds forward on her lightened course.” “Once, 'twas my watch below (worse luck!) A sudden squall the vessel struck: With half my clothes about me thrown I rushed on deck; what havoc there! The topsails from the bolt-ropes blown, Topgallant-masts and royals gone, And huddled sails and shattered spars And tangled tackle everywhere; While all amazed, our gallant tars Stood at the sudden wreck aghast, Nor seemed to heed the swift commands The Captain shouted through the blast. The heaving staysail swagged and swung As from the strained jibboom it hung: Of course with some sharp words addrest To two or three, our smartest hands, Forward I jumped to do my best. They followed quick;—the lightest, I The bowsprit's end could safest try; We grasped the frail spar like grim death, And shut our eyes and held our breath, Clinging with tightened arms and knees When o'er us dashed successive seas And blinded, ducked, and drenched us, till Seizing the chance of every lull To look and lash and tug and pull, We furled the sail and got it still; Though no one knew as there we clung How badly that jibboom was sprung. But when I 'lighted on the deck Shaking the water off, the good White-headed Master, who had stood, He told me since, in breathless mood (His heart was in his mouth, he said, While looking on, for very dread) Threw his old arm about my neck, ‘God bless you!’ cried he, ‘my brave Son! 'Twas nobly, beautifully done! The safety of my Ship and Crew This blessed day—I swear 'tis true, Is owing, under God, to you!’— Mother! ten times the risk I'd run To have such praise declared my due— By such a gallant Seaman too!” VII. But with these Ocean-scenes the Sea-boy fed On others fruitful both for heart and head; Had glimpses of strange lands and men as strange; Saw with each clime their minds and manners change: Learnt how on God by various names they call, While God's great smile shines equally on all; Allah, unimaged, One; Brahma, Vishnu, And Siva—triple-imaged One in Three; Ormusd—‘Ahuramasda’—name profound— ‘Living I Am’—that Splendour! One of Two At war—dark Ahriman his throne invading, Piercing with Evil first the shell so sound, His cosmic Egg-of-Order's perfect round;— Manitou, mistlike with-his pipewhiff fading;— Buddha—prince, mystic, moralist—at last Made God for teaching that no God can be:— Arab—Hindu—Red Indian—Jew—Parsee; Chinese Joss-beater, little reverent, too— That cracker-loving creature of the past— Blithe spirit—soul a lifeless leaden cast; Who with high-sublimated Gods, a store (His Buddha—Fo; Confutzee's Tien; Taou That pure God-Intellect of Lao-tse), Breathes blinding fog—Convention-fixed of yore— Of grossest superstition. With the rest, The necromancing negro of the West, The terrorist of Obeah. These he scanned; And many a charm on each delightful land Lavished by Art's or liberal Nature's hand: Inhaled the breath that through dense mist distils From green spruce woods and all the sea-air fills With sweet sour odours from Canadian hills: Dwelt with enraptured gaze on Hindostan's Umbrageous bowers of spice and spreading fans, And glistening ribbon-leaves and arching plumes; Her starry palms and sacred peepuls set On many-fingered roots, a snaky net; Or propping their high-roofed magnificence On pendent pillars; clustering gorgeous glooms Whence bulbous domes of marble mosques and tombs From that black-green deep-bosoming defence Swell snow-white into burning atmosphere; Or gilt pagodas rise above the shade Like spires of thick cardoon-leaves closely laid, All in blue tanks reflected, grave and clear.

Or else that tropic Isle of Springs entranced The lad—who revelled in its noonday glare And silence deep, so tremulously hot— So gently interrupted when it chanced A sudden and soft fluttering in the air, Like silverpaper rumpled, startlingly Whispered some flying rainbow-fragment nigh Darting in downy purple golden-shot; Or, as suspended by its long bill's tip On viewless wings a-quiver poised to sip A crimson cactus-bloom—the honied dew Which from that silky breast, so fit in hue And texture fine, the airy suckling drew. Safely that land of merry slaves he saw Late ruined by a half-completed law; When thoughtless theorists had flung aside The evil bonds by ancient Custom tied, Nor better bonds they wore themselves, supplied; Had left to tyrannies of grovelling sense The victims of their vague benevolence; Left them still basely free from forethought, care, And loftier loads the self-dependent bear; Left them untaught to welcome Labour's pains, More nobly slaves to all a freeman's chains; To know, the highest freedom all can reach Is but the highest self-restraint of each; True freedom a serene and sober thing, With loyalty to Right crowned inward King; While laws of Duty made despotic, make The only freedom mobs nor kings can break. IX. So four years passed: to him a happy time. Meanwhile his brothers both in youthful prime Had perished; one, the pest of that fair clime, The demon lurking in its loveliness, The yellow fever's swiftly-withering flame Had caught up and consumed: and that distress Scarce over, from the Storm-Cape tidings came Doubtful, which soon for doubt left little room, The other must have met as sharp a doom— Himself, his ship and shipmates whirled away In Ocean's wild tempestuous embrace To some unknown unfathomable Tomb. Then did the anguish-smitten Father pray The youngest, last remaining of his race To leave a calling where such risks were rife, And live at home, his age's staff and stay. So, with what grace he might, though grieving sore, The stripling gave his dutiful consent Henceforth to follow some pursuit ashore, Where Death, the Shade that dogs the steps of Life, Upon his prey though equally intent, Because less startling, seems less imminent. Canto the Second. Will-o'-wisp-chasing. 1, 2. Ranolf a student. Greek tragedians. 3. The Phædo and Socrates. 4. Distaste for narrow creeds. 5. Metaphysics; Locke gets rid of the secondary qualities of Matter; Berkeley of the primary, and Abstract Matter itself; Hume of Abstract Mind. 6. All anticipated by the Hindus—Locke and Berkeley by the Brahmin, Kapila; Hume by the Buddhist, Kasyapa. 7. Kant—makes ‘God’ a necessary inference—real only in the Mind; 8. Fichte (suggesting Carlyle)—a ‘Divine Idea’—the ‘Tendency making for Righteousness.’ Duty of the soul to harmonise with it. 9. This like later Buddhism. 10. Fichte's life a triumph of Soul over Matter. I. To tutors now and long-left tasks restored, Our sea-emboldened, self-reliant Boy Soon grew enamoured of his new employ. And many things those tutors never meant Into a mind of such inquiring bent His classics and his metaphysics poured. But most he loved, could ne'er enough adore The Godlike spirit of that grand Greek lore That first taught Man his glorious being's height; Taught him to stand, the Universe before, Erect in moral, intellectual might, And brave, in strength of Soul, the adverse infinite. How would their strains his kindling bosom warm, Those daring darling Poets, who enshrined The freest Spirit in the purest Form, In matchless Beauty such consummate Mind. How would he triumph with the Theban Maid Who, in no armour but instinctive sense, The panoply of conscious right, arrayed, Her lofty sentiment her sole defence, Risked all the murderous rage of tyrant force To snatch a burial for a brother's corse; Though all the gods—all worldly wisdom's saws, All cherished loves and all Convention's laws, Denounced herself and spurned her holy cause. Antigone could teach him that the test Of right and wrong lay in his own free breast; That right was right, despite high-seated wrong And throned Authority by Custom strong! That Man of all external aid bereft, Had still himself and staunch endurance left; Could stand above all Circumstance elate And trust high Nature in the fight with Fate. II. And when he read the agonizing cries That vulture-tortured Giant in the skies Utters in deathless and sublime despair, Doomed for his love to Man that woe to bear; And all the sad majestic converse, round The pinnacles of Caucasus snow-crowned, Swelling like solemn Music, and again Dying along the illimitable air, As, one by one, supernal visitants Come floating up to watch the ghastly pants And writhings of the Titan, and with vain Compassion, taunts—temptations vainer still— Assail his grand unconquerable Will, And bid him break his voluntary chain, Abandon Man, scorn that vicarious pain, And hail the gloomy Tyrant's selfish reign; When all the student's sense of justice rose, Stirred by the dauntless Poet's great appeal, In wrath against the author of such woes, And his young heart would passionately feel For the doomed donor of the god-wrung fire; Think you he ne'er was tempted to inquire, Was that outworn Olympian rule of Zeus The only tyranny men called divine? Was there no other nature-startling use Of absolute power—no other punishment Of love, inflicted on the innocent, At which instinctive Justice would repine? III. But most his soul was wonderstruck to see To what a height humanity could reach In that divinest hemlock-drinker—he Who welcomed Death less evil than the breach Of fealty to his country's laws, or scant Reliance on the faith he came to teach: The truths his nature forced him to proclaim; The necessary outcome of his frame, Mental and moral—by the innate law Of evolution for its excellence Provided—as inevitable thence As from the sap of each peculiar plant The special blossom earth and air must draw; Trust absolute in the perfect Power above; His perfect goodness; and what these must prove (For with the ill around, what other just Conclusion could he reach, with such a trust?) That sole relief of every human want, Soother and solace of the general sigh— The Soul's unbodied Immortality! And where was ever a sublimer page Than that which paints the God-sent Prophet-Sage Cheerily urging with his latest breath This lofty creed upon his weeping band Of friends—his very gaoler too unmanned; Then standing forth, and with dilating eyes That look straightforward—bold and calm—‘bull-wise’ Into the dread Eternity so nigh, With one libation to the gods on high, Drinking the Elixir both of Life and Death! And as the deadly influence upward stole And sobs broke forth he could no more console, Lifting the mantle from his failing sight, Just ere his soaring spirit winged its flight, To make with accents faint his last bequest— While haply in those eyes supreme o'er pain A moment's humorous glimmer shone again— That votive cock to the medicinal God Of herbs—his soul's last evidence to be Of joy at shaking off this mortal clod, And his triumphant gratitude attest To one whose potent drug had set him free. IV. Well, the great Sea-Life; the quick-shifting crowd Of Sects that showed the human Spirit down-bowed With equal faith each sect before its Lord, While each the others' equally ignored: Then the Greek grandeurs where that Spirit was seen Erect and self-dependent and serene; All made the youth still less and less incline To cramping creeds or any partial shrine. His heart was but one endless protestation Against the slightest shackles on free Thought: Rather than not attain the end he sought, His strong intolerant love of toleration, His towering spirit of tyrannous liberty, Had forced all mental bondslaves to be free.— Then all for Nature! “She alone for me!” “What”—he would cry in his impetuous style, Climbing, perhaps, some mountain-peak the while, “What need of Temples! All around, Through Earth's expanse, through Heaven's profound, A conscious Spirit beauty-crowned, A visible glory breathes and breaks, And of these mountains, moors and lakes A Holiest of the Holies makes! Above—around—where'er you be, A true Shekinah shining see! With ever-fuming Incense there An Altar burns for praise and prayer! Whence better to your ‘Lord of Love’ Can sorrow waft its wail above Than from some desert-waste forlorn, Where sadly, of all splendour shorn, Creeps in the stilly-dripping Morn? Where best, ye broken-hearted, groan On ‘God’ for help but all alone Where forests make their mighty moan? Where best exult in heart-hushed praise If not where hills their great tops raise Majestic in the silent blaze Of Sunset over Ocean's haze? What! shall the Spirit only draw Near that unknown and nameless Awe Where, beauteous though it be, there stands Some puny work of human hands? But I, O mystic Might! no less As thy all-hallowed home will bless Sublimest Nature's loveliness! But I will dare, O Power Divine! Revere One true transcendent Shrine, This flashing Universe of Thine!” V. Now with uprooting Metaphysics toyed The youth—their tangled subtleties enjoyed; A wary old Professor was his guide, Who welcomed every light from every side; Yet most—such sad mistrust experience taught Of plausibly profoundest human thought— On common sense and mother-wit relied; One, who—so high seemed Nature—Man so low— Felt dwarfed to humbleness he scorned to show; Yet, that their dwarfishness men would not feel, Moved to fresh scorn he could not quite conceal. He would have let the learner-lad confine His tasks to careworn, truth-adoring Locke; The lad would learn what ‘paying out more line’ Where Locke had cast it, led to,—solid rock, Mud, quicksand, or the fathomless profound. The more line ran, more depth there seemed to sound. It took him, as you know, to that rare creed, Etherial, beautiful—the fertile seed Matured by Locke, our goodly Bishop sowed Afresh, and reared into rich thought that glowed Heavy with ears of amaranthine gold That yet may yield their glorious hundred-fold. Spirit was crowned when Soldier-sage Descartes Plato's ‘Innate Ideas’ anew sustained; But Hobbes—Gassendi—proved Ideas in part Are through the Senses by Experience gained. Locke to full growth their treacherous sapling trained. “All possible ideas are mere sensations, Or our reflections on them,” Locke insists; “But half the first are Sense's own creations, No faithful types of what in truth exists; Not in the rose the red, nor in light-rays Its texture splits, but in the eyes that gaze; Not in the fire, but in our frames, the heat; Not in the honey, but our tongues, the sweet; Not in the thunder, but our ears, the roar; These are impressions on the brain—no more: But form, solidity, extension, power To move or rest, are Matter's genuine dower, Her real outside existence.” “Nay—pursue Your doubt,” cries Berkeley; “probe them through and through, And you will find these qualities you flatter Yourself you prove essential in this Matter, No more substantial than its red and blue.” And then the mighty mitred Analyst, Silk-aproned subtle-tongued Psychologist, Thinker by few believed, by all beloved, With frankest power “unanswerably proved, What no man in his senses can admit,” (A phrase of little truth and not much wit) Proved that all things we hear, see, feel around, Have no such base as Matter—nay, no base Or being at all but Spirit—their sole ground. Forces are they, from Infinite Mind proceeding, Spiritually active, wheresoe'er it be, On finite mind to print, in order due, Sensations, not deceptive nor misleading; But spiritual coin as spiritual Coiner, true, And real with Spirit's sole reality. So Berkeley said and proved his flawless case. But Hume came sliding in with smiling face, Veiling the grimmest strength in easy grace; The pleasant playful Giant—gentle Chief Of sceptics, dealing blows without a sign Of effort—slashing with a sword so fine— Killing with lightning-touches bright and brief; So wise, so good; whose adversaries found His silken glove a Cestus iron-bound, When staggering all the gladiator press He proved—or seemed to prove—to their distress And ours, that Thought itself and Consciousness Had no such base as Mind—which only meant Trains of impressions and ideas that went And came in nothing—neither more nor less; For no recipient spirit could be perceived, And Matter was already gone and shent; And he had settled to his own content (To such a dogma, ye who can, consent!) No Cause did ever yet produce Effect However Custom may the two connect. Therefore for pictures we within us find, No Power without—above—of any kind Need be, or could be, as their cause assigned. So must we Matter, Mind, God, Soul, alike— As metaphysical abstractions scout— Out of the ranks of real existence strike: And yet as Mind and Matter both, without Or spite of Reason, must be still believed— Nature took care of that—that much achieved— The only clear conclusion was dim Doubt. VI. Thus Locke by Berkeley—Berkeley thus by Hume, Was pounced on in retributive swift doom, Hand over hand, as children play, so pat, Each crushing his great predecessor flat: So swiftly hurried down the eddying tide Of speculation which began to flow In the far East three thousand years ago When doubting dusky Sages threw aside Their faith in those symbolic wheelspoke arms And double heads of deities of Ind; And some mild paddy-fed pale-blooded crew Of subtle theorists argued nought was true, Nought real but Brahma—him in whom inhere All magic-lantern shadows that appear As living shapes in this illusive sphere. Then Brahma's essence, subtilised and thinned, In Kapila's self-styled ‘Perfect Wisdom’ grew To Absolute Spirit—Thinking Substance pure And abstract as that pure unworldly Jew, The spiritual Spinoza, ever drew. But earlier still, in wild recoil more sure From Brahmin tyranny of creed and caste, The o'er-refining Orient fancy passed To dreams the maddest ever Reasoning spun, In that high-moralled faith that still has charms (Because its founder's self, made God, replaced And vivified so soon for vulgar taste The No-God he had taught) to sway such swarms Dusk Aryan and Turanian tawny-skinned; That fullest-millioned Faith beneath the Sun, Which Sakya Muni—princely eremite— First saddened into—sickened with the sight Of sorrow and pain inseparable seeming From life—his own a pleasure-sated blight With high desire forlornly through it gleaming; So with a proud deliberate despair Conceived his monstrous method of redeeming, By guiding, souls back to their primal night Of non-existence; which his pupil and friend Kas-yapá teaches they already share, Therein are based—begin—and ought to end; Nor rests, like Hume, content in doubt to pause, But from his metaphysic ‘Basket’ draws Negation of all spirit—God—first cause— Brahma or Absolute Being; all and each— Creator and created—matter—mind— Alike chimeras; wisdom's highest reach To know this nothingness; the soul's true aim To lose existence and partake the same; Extinguished then, with consciousness consigned To darkness—blown out like a taper's flame, To enter so ‘Nirvana’—there to be Absurdly blest with blank Nonentity. VII. Air-lording Allemannia! vast and dim The cloud-racks next our Aeronaut must skim! Say rather, leave, a Reaper, worn-out fields Of Thought for golden crops thy culture yields, Though hedged with worse than Indian orange-thorns— Sharp subtleties for—Doubt's intrusive horns?— As Locke's Sensation-creed, worked out, had brought Matter and Spirit both alike to nought, Did not those soaring Germans reinstate Inborn ideas—and hence a Soul innate? Did not great Kant in pedant's jargon shew How, paramount within the human Mind— Not from Sensation nor Experience gained— Ideas, the fruit of the ‘Pure Reason’ reigned? As, from this fount Truths Mathematic, so From this—called Conscience—Moral Truths must flow By mere necessity? while those two facts, Conditions fixed, wherein ‘Pure Reason’ acts— The Soul—the Universe—but presuppose And force you to the grand Idea behind Whence both must spring, wherein are both combined— To God—the source of all that thinks or knows, All Being's boundless origin and close?— Did not poor Faith, from shift to shift doubt-prest Find in that ‘Reason Pure’ peace—refuge—rest? Trusting both scoff and sceptic-proof to be, In pachydermatous Philosophy So puzzling, panoplied? and might not she, Man's deathless Hope, in such a tangle rude Of prickly briars of Logic hid away, Rest like the Beauty in the long-charmed wood, Serene—secure—inviolable? Say, Did no great Truth obscure and latent lie In all that chaff of dialectics dry— A chrysalis (like that with reeled-off floss, Bared of its dress, all amber gleam and gloss, The careful schoolboy hides in homely bran) Whence a new Psyche should emerge for Man? Like Psyche's self, say,—from blue Italy Prepared to cross the rude rough-handling sea, Laid up in wood and iron, sound and safe In naked beauty from all chance of chafe; So closely presses round her spiritual face And limbs of tender marble and white grace, The hard-caked sawdust of her packing case. But, O conclusion lame and impotent! O rage of vigorous reasoning vainly spent! Those fixed Ideas—inseparably blent With all the rest—Time—Space and Cause—'tis plain, Though notions connate with the nascent brain, Have in essential fact no solid ground— Only within the human soul are found; Though necessary bases of our thought Are from no prototypes beyond us brought! That ‘God’ is but a sort of ghost confined To haunt the shadowy chambers of the mind! As if within a glass-roofed palace grew Some strange grand Tree of mystic shape and hue, With various virtues wondrously arrayed— With mighty fronds and majesty of shade, And towering crest sufficiently sublime; Within those vitreous walls compelled, no doubt, By nature's laws luxuriantly to sprout, But with no fellow—no resemblance known, Or able to exist in any clime 'Mid the green glories of the world without; A most magnificent, yet monstrous cheat, Proud overgrowth of artificial heat, And that peculiar edifice alone; No shade or shelter offering when you ply Your weary way beneath the naked sky! “Why, if this God's a product of our own, Which ends in us, though there perforce it breeds, A doubtful light which but to darkness leads,” Said Ranolf's Guide—“what waste of toil and time These more than acrobatic feats to climb Such crags precipitous, such slippery heights, Where no rewarding view our toil requites; No vision of the City long-desired, Though brief as that in Moslem myths—perchance Seen standing—sudden—silent—sunrise-fired Before the desert-wanderer's awestruck glance; Far stretching multitudinous array Of gilded domes and snowy minarets, And tiers of long arcades rich-roofed with frets More delicate than frostwork! then again Gone—vanished! and a hundred years in vain Resought, but gladdening nevermore the day. Not e'en such glimpse, O mighty Kant!—at most When we have reached your height at so much cost, In densest fog we see a finger-post You say directs us to that City fair, But is no proof of any City there! Some letters on its arms obscurely seen Your spectacles discover; what they mean In worse than three-tongued wedge-rows sealed up fast, We have to take from you on trust at last.” VIII. Whose reveries then could our vexed Student lure? Whom sought he next?— That lofty Spirit and pure The march majestic and the genuine ring Of whose high eloquence on one high theme, How best aloft the expanded Soul may wing Her way, and best sustain her flight supreme— Had all the warranty a life could bring, The faithful mirror of his faith—sublime In self-dependent stateliness severe, And steadfast single eminence of aim;— Fichte—whose name recalls a dearer Fame— A Power intenser—trenchant—towering—true; In Custom's ocean-strata prompt and prime Impassioned insight's dynamite-mines to spring; Of Spirits in unspiritual days who cling To Spirit—stanchest if the most austere; Right sympathiser though to satire wedded; Rich lode of gold in rugged quartz imbedded!— He whose capacious soul's ascending Sphere Oft looms obscure while flashing brightness through Dull mists it kindles till they disappear; Who, rolling back the ponderous stone of Time, Makes the dead Past, upstarting clear in fine Fork-lightnings of Truth's poesy, outshine The living Present, whose loud shams—with might And hammer like his own white-knuckled Thor's, And scorn that pities while it most abhors, And humour laughing at his scorn's wild flight,— His rough right hand was ever clenched to smite!— Fichte—great voice to rouse, great heart to cheer! This greater could not hear it and not leap In unison, ‘Deep calling unto Deep;’ Could not from such a credence and career Withhold the dower of his undying praise; Which saw therein the far-reflected gleam Of high-endeavouring old illustrious days; Heard solemn echoes or the etherial flow Of Attic pacings of the Portico And whispers from the groves of Academe, Where Truth alone by sages world-renowned Was sought, and made Life's rule at once when found;— Fichte struck out once more for truths that shine Instinctive and immediately divine. In consciousness is all of God we know; But consciousness proclaims Him; neither dim Nor doubtful He; all Being's source and stream; Nature exists in us, and we in Him. For ‘Me’ and ‘Not-Me’—Universe and Soul Are one—not two—and Consciousness the whole: Nature its passive, Soul its active side; In Consciousness are both contained—allied; Nature—a picture by that ‘Me’ supplied— A glorious web which from fine stuff within Itself the Spider Consciousness can spin. So all is Spirit—Matter there is none But part and product of the Soul alone. And what ideal does Consciousness proclaim As all we know of Him whom ‘God’ we name?— That active principle, which clearly seen Is working out, whatever intervene, The triumph in the Universe and Man, Of all that's useful, beautiful, and good; That Force which forwards its consummate plan Of progress endless towards the perfect Day Of moral Order's universal sway; And to the Soul above all tumult cries Of one high Duty still to be pursued,— With that ‘Divine Idea’ to harmonise The Will, and all its faculties subdued Into devout co-operative mood, Press forward freely to the ennobling prize. IX. High thoughts! yet haply Hindu still; so like The course—nor much unlike the goal—to those The later Buddhists for the soul propose, Dropping the dreary nihilistic phases Of Sakya's faith too purely insane to strike The fancy of the myriads, else its foes; Backsliding into healthier dreams and brighter, In Burmah or Nepaul; or such as lie Obscurely hidden in the mystic cry, The shaveling in red robes and yellow mitre, In snowy Thibetan devoutly raises At Lama-ridden Lhassa, when he phrases In one short shibboleth his prayers and praises: “Gem in the Lotus-flower, Amen!” whereby He breathes his soul's desire to wing its flight Through Æons of blest Being—height o'er height, Till evermore suffused with purer light It merge—from death, disease, old age and need, And all the griefs of gross existence freed,— Perfect, in Buddha's Soul—its boundless meed— Absorbed in that All-perfect Infinite!— A heterodox ‘Nirvana,’ worthier far By ages of vast virtue to be won; No ‘taper-flame blown out’—a blissful star Lost in the splendour of the noonday sun. X. “True,” thought our friends, “this Man was true, indeed; A noble Teacher of a noble Creed! Yet, to persuade us how the Soul may climb Triumphant o'er material Space and Time, Stronger than all that dialectic strife, His most convincing logic was his life. Of truths the stern Philosopher had taught Proof most profound, perhaps, the Patriot brought, When, finishing his last great fight for God, And many a rapt impassioned period, Down from his desk the mighty Master came, Unmoved by murmur low, or plaudit loud, Or fervent blessing from the student-crowd; And left the loved arena of his fame With shouldered musket in the ranks to stand, And fall or conquer for his Father Land.” Canto the Third. From Wisp to Morass. 1. Schelling's ‘Absolute’—a blind power working in Nature, conscious only in Man. 2. Panatheistic and Buddhist. 3. Hegel makes the ‘Absolute,’ a Unity being evolved from contradictory principles existing as the ‘Conditioned.’ 4. A glimpse of his alleged meaning. 5. Result of Metaphysics based on Abstract Thought alone. Behind the ‘Apparent’ must be a ‘Real,’ and (6) as wondrous. The Universe—why to be limited to or by our perceptions of it? 7. The transcendentalists throw no light on this ‘Real;’ only prove it exists; and that we cannot fathom it. 8. So to Comte and Positivism. Denial of all Immaterial Existence. 9. Comte's new Religion. I. Then Schelling plies the metaphysic ball, Which Reason's racket still will strike aloft To overfly Sensation's bounding wall, Though to the ground a thousand times it fall. Those two Ideas we prate about so oft, The Soul—the Universe—are really two, And are identified—O, not in you, Nor any finite Consciousness so small, But only in the Absolute—the All. Spirit is Matter that itself surveys; And Matter, Spirit's undiscerning phase; They are the magnet's two opposing poles, And each the other balances—controls: Both in a centre of indifference rest, Which their essential being is confest: As in the magnet's every point—we see In all the works of Nature just these three; But that which bounds them all and each degree, The Absolute—the Magnet's self—must be, Except at Being's most exalted height— Impersonal—unconscious—infinite; For God—that Absolute—still strives in vain, In Nature's blind inferior works; nor can In any form Self-Consciousness attain, Save in the highest reasoning power of Man, That central point, which Soul and Nature gain;— Unconscious else the Universal Pan. II. Short comment made that old Idoloclast: “Behold, then, three-and-twenty centuries passed, The stately Ship of Western Thought at last, Striking and stranded on the barren shore Where struck that Buddhist bark so long before, Left high and dry with all its phantom freight; Thither impelled by that satiric fate That dogs our intellectual pride, and brings Shipwreck with its conviction shallow and vain, That 'tis a storm-proof Cruiser, this poor brain, Built, rigged, and manned to circumnavigate The rondure vast of all existing things. So Schelling digs where Kas-yapá had dug; Magniloquent, yet microscopic elf, So makes all Nature but the high-plumed hearse Of God gone dead; so, whipping out his cord, O metaphysical and monstrous Thug! Strangles Creation's soul out; in a word, Makes, while he feigns to flout Man's pride of Self, That Self sole Mind-Life in the Universe. “Alas! my Ranolf, were it wrong to call This the most drear of metaphysic dreams— The most revolting, mean result of all? The Being, then, of highest worth it seems, Which that World-ghost, that blind and senseless force Evolves in its uncaused unconscious course, Is but this inefficient soul of ours— The one God, Man! for all his boasted powers, Dubbed truly by that wanton wittiest Greek, ‘Clay-puppet, poor—ephemeral—wingless—weak!’ Is He the sole Intelligence? can he The crown and climax of all Being be Throughout that million-starred immensity? Prove it by demonstration flawless, strong; The wild conclusion proves some premiss wrong; Absurd, as if those dwellers by old Nile Had, in unsymbolled Scarab-worship vile, Crowned with a beetle their great Pyramid— The Monarch Builder out of sight and hid.” III. To mystic depths and mistier. Hegel shrouds Himself and Truth in denselier-rolling clouds, Like Arab genie sore opprest in fight; His splendour flashes through redoubled night. Thoughts are the same as Things; and what is true Of one must be so of the other too. No base but Thought the Mind's conceptions claim, And your ‘external Objects’ have the same; In Thought what proves consistent, rational, sound, Must then in Things be Real and Actual found. But Reason says: Your Absolute enfolds All Actuals; cannot be at all, or holds Good—Evil—utter contraries in one— Mutual destructives in Its union. Therein encounter, coexist, embrace, Flat contradictions which whene'er you trace The bounds of Being, stare you in the face! Nay, Being's self therein, a balance lies Of yoked yet suicidal contraries: For Non-Existence, as a Thought, must be Like pure Existence, a Reality: While of pure abstract Being, uncombined With qualities of any form or kind, Nought can we know or predicate aright: So Being falls into Non-Being's plight; Each dies—revives—becomes its opposite.— The positive and negative descried In all things are such discords so allied. For each Idea or Object (which you please, Both are the same) evolves itself like these; But these destroy and shut each other out; A negative is all they bring about; Still as the Idea is there and must remain, That negative must be denied again. As Abstract Space, for instance, cannot be Conceived as bounded or as boundless either; Yet must be one to be at all, you see, Then cannot be at all, because 'tis neither; A negative which meets denial clear, For Space is something after all—and here. That last negation, then, the Idea revives, And subtler complex Being to it gives In the ‘Conditioned’ where alone it lives. Those magnet-poles, the two extremes, are gone, And in the central point survive alone; Object and Subject, Universe and Soul, Are in that centre, one and real, and whole; Each in itself a nothing we may call, But their relation to each other—all. Like alkali and acid, they attract Each other, meet, and perish in the act— The effervescence rests the only fact. So the ‘Becoming’—the immediate spring From Nought to Somewhat, is the vital thing;— “Well, well!” broke out our student here, “at least It cannot be denied this great High Priest Of metaphysic Mysteries, has the wit, The ant-lion boasts who scoops his cone-shaped pit In subtlest sand, and there securely hides; And when into the trap the victim slides, And strives in vain to climb the slipping sides, Down, deeper down, the crafty digger goes, And o'er his prey such blinding dust-showers throws, He triumphs quickly, and the intruder draws Bewildered into those remorseless jaws.” But when unflinching Hegel flatly laid The axiom down he would not have gainsaid, Disdaining compromise—dispute—or flout (Settling so coolly Hamlet's staggering doubt) “To Be is Not-to-be—and Not-to-be To Be—agree to that, or disagree, 'Tis Logic's first great axiom, and most true!” What could a youth with risible organs do, At this, Philosophy's last grand exploit, But ‘ding the book the distance of a quoit’ Away—and with a shout of laughter loud, Light a cigar, and blow—as clear a cloud?— IV. “Bide a wee!” cried his Tutor, “my lad!”—with his cautious, sarcastic old tongue— “There's a question I'd have you to ask, as you hirple these mystics among, When certain, quite certain you're right, ‘But suppose after all I am wrong?’— Say that Matter is nothing but Spirit, as Berkeley has best of all taught, All the ‘Things’ we call ‘outward’—Ideas; why, the Universe then is all Thought; And its Laws are but forms of our Thinking; then surely Itself may be nought But the image and reflex of Mind; and the Two may be held to keep pace In their manifestations and march—all their movements in Time and in Space— And as One run together their changeful, developing, infinite race! Say the Universe still is in growth; still for Æons on Æons must beat Its great wings towards an Eyrie afar; that a Cosmos as yet incomplete, Towards a Perfect as yet unconceived must the whirling Infinitude fleet! Then the Mind that conception would reach when the Universe reaches the fact.— Now through Being, organic, unorganised,—mark how one Law may be tracked: In its innermost depths internecine two absolute contraries act— Two principles, neither allowing the other alone to exist, Into either the other still shifting, alternately sighted and missed, (Like the eyes at once open and shut in that trick-begot face of the Christ) But for ever evolving a third—a Unity yet unattained.— Well, this ‘Notion’ of Being's high working, a Thought by abstraction though gained From Actual Things, was the Thought from the first that causatively reigned In the Absolute Essence; compelled their concretion; still sways them all through; Nay, by Hegel on high dialectic is throned in such royalty true, All progressions of Nature and Mind must precisely accord with it too! 'Tis the mystical tune they must dance to; like sunny-haired rows Of Hamelin children must follow wherever its melody flows, And our Hegel—our Piper sublime, transcendentally capering goes! Then, as one vast Idea there may be which our present conception transcends, And to realise, organise which the whole Universe struggles and tends; Of Ideas that are swarming subordinate, each its own contraries blends In the group it forms round it as central true type and Ideal designed To be reached by their organisation when perfect, each after its kind: Which type through their points the most opposite, not the most like, we must find. And as Life-groups from balancing discords must physical concords contrive, So may Moral antagonist Forces be destined to struggle and strive, Till exalted, transfigured at last in a higher new nature they thrive! Do not Passion and Principle, Impulse and Duty, so act in the soul?— May not Matter and Spirit, Good—Ill, so be working—all parts as the whole— Nay, our Infinite-Finite at war have some Peace unimagined for goal?— —What! the Actual then, the ‘perceived,’ will not to accordance be brought With what Hegel conceives! nor the Universe show itself working or wrought On a ‘Notion’ so subtle, you say!—Well, 'tis some consolation—it ought! For with ‘Thought’ for First Cause, 'tis a bolder and grander conception at least Than the harmony clashed out by Atoms, that gift from the primitive East; The Concordia discors, how mystic! which haply the sadness increased Of the cheeriness forced and forlorn so cherished by Horace of old, As—his head early grey—the sleek sensitive Poet, close-wrapping the fold Of his toga with sunset blood-stained, down the Appian dreamily strolled. And though Hegel affirm contradictions in terms that each other repel, Since their high reconciling Idea no Reason at present can tell, When the last is discovered, why—Logic and Language may reach it as well. And suppose, in his ‘Immanent Reason,’ as Cause all these wonders behind, But ‘Intelligent Infinite Will,’—may not Hegel and . . . much he opined Ages hence be a Lord and a Law to maturer and mightier Mind? V. “But now consider. What at last remains From all that toil of transcendental brains? If, like the bristled monster-minims seen To jerk and writhe and wriggle goggle-eyed Within the lighted circle on the wall Thrown from the water-drop compressed between Glass plates by microscopic lantern-sheen, These crabbed and cribbed philosophers go near To craze, because the Apparent's magic sphere So hems them in; and Hegel above all Seemed, like the fabled Scorpion girt with fire, With his own logic-nippers to inflict A bite that killed himself, in mad desire And effort to escape from bonds so strict— That radiant round of the ‘Phenomenal,’ And dive into the depths that lie beyond;— What then?—that grand mysterious Outside, That Ocean of their soundings frantic, fond, Is there—there still, and cannot be denied: Howe'er the Thing we may define or name, Whatever dim solutions we disclaim, The ‘Unapparent’ still exists the same! “For granting it be made by reasoning plain That all the fair impressions on the brain Are not mere pictures of such things around Where no real types precisely like are found, But from those decorating Senses gain, In passing through them, all the dædal dress Of qualities we fancy they possess,— ‘Not in the rose the red—nor in light-rays Its texture splits, but in the eyes that gaze; Not in the thunder—honey—fire, the roar, The heat or sweetness we perceive; all these Lie in the Sense that hears, tastes, feels or sees; Well, it remains as certain as before The causes of these feelings lie without, Beyond us still; for who pretends to doubt We do not, cannot of ourselves excite All these sensations? and still less the play Of keen impressions that by night and day In selfsame order, sequence, and array Reach other minds by millions? There must be A something causing all we feel and see. What Things are in Themselves, though none can say, They still have in themselves—for base and stay, Some pure, essential, true Reality.” VI. “But tell me now,” said Ranolf, “by what right Can they assert that unimagined sphere Of Causes is not varied, powerful, bright And beautiful as aught we see or hear Or any way perceive within the Mind? ‘Nature in her insentient solitude Must as eternal Darkness be defined, Eternal Silence.’ Wherefore thus conclude? The Light and Sound are in ourselves, say you; The Darkness—Silence then should be so too! The last should our alternatives alone Be held—not Nature's—when the first are gone. Say Sound and Light are hers, but only heard Or seen by us when certain nerves are stirred. 'Tis hard to think, were all Mankind destroyed, This glorious World would be a dumb black void!— But those mysterious Agents that can start Sensations thus in human consciousness, Would still, if that had vanished, be no less Active, impulsive, wonderful, divine; And might at least convey, somehow impart To other Souls whom other organs bless, Say (for their nature none of course can guess) Lights gorgeous, jewel-tinted, more than shine For us—for our beholding all too fine; And melodies of such entrancing tone As would outravish all to mortal music known! “Surely no sober reason would pretend To make the wondrous Universe depend On our perceptions—there begin and end? Must Senses like our own exhaust its powers? May there not be more Senses too than ours? Does the Sun cease to be a Sun, and die, Hurled from his throne in yon majestic Sky, Whene'er the Worm that grooves the flowery fret Of pulpit-work—or Spider at his net On some rose-knotted oak-carved canopy Within a great Cathedral's gloom and grace— May lose the few faint rays it feels through panes That serve to bound, e'en while they brighten, all Its tiny being's scant-accorded space; Dim rays half quenched in that transparent pall, Yet rainbow-rich with saintly blazonry And dusky with a wealth of Angel-stains?” VII. Said that old hoary Candour, “Haply true Your notion there! Yet what have we to do With possible Souls you guess at, not our own, Or powers of Nature wholly hid from view? Who can assent to or deny what you May dream of in the Utterly Unknown?— But do they open—these Idealists— Any grand oriel, loop or sight-hole new, That Unapparent Realm may shine into; Through which the Eternal Radiance may be seen Behind the glory-dusked Phantasmal Screen, Our heavenly-stained Cathedral Universe?— Well, I must hold their chance thereof the worse From their inveterate resolve to find That Universe—all Being that exists— Wrapt in and rounded by the human Mind. “Yet at lowest their gossamer frail filligree Of Abstractions but half comprehensible serves To prove—though this visible Universe be But ‘sensations,’—mere pictures impressed on the nerves Through the Consciousness flitting in shadow and sheen; Yet beyond or behind it must still be implied A Something, more real and as wondrous, Unseen, Where the Causes that call up the pictures abide: And to prove, by their failure, a limited brain Like the human—the Finite—can never expound That Reality fully, but struggles in vain Either Infinite Nature or Being to sound; Either Matter or Spirit to reach through—to round, Or their Essence or Origin fathom—explain!” VIII. So Ranolf leaves the crew who strive to rear Truth's Palace on the clouds of Abstract Thought; Tries those who on the concrete base have wrought Of solid Fact we see and feel and hear: “Come France the fine-idealled! a Wanderer aid! Surely in any faith in France essayed For Man's high wants provision will be made! Did not, to God's great glory—or his own— Pious Voltaire erect a church of stone? Pious Rousseau foredamn or save his soul As he might hit or miss a cork-tree's bole? Pious pure tiger-monkey, Robespierre, Most tender-conscienced bloodhound, slavering there, Find soulless Man no workable machine, And bay for ‘God’ to back his guillotine? Elijah-mantled in silk-coat sky-blue, The powdered Prophet ostrich-plumed anew, Upholding to his sanctimonious nose, So keen to scent out blood, a fullblown rose, Proclaimed his condescending cool decree Which deigned to bid his ‘Supreme Being’ be!— Surely this novel nostrum, all the rage, Of Comte, sleek-hatted and sleek-coated Mage, Cherry-cheeked, dapper-souled, most dainty Sage, The human heart's deep yearnings will assuage, And steep in light and truth a woeworn Age! “But O, what champion for the eternal fray Is this, whose tactics are to run away, Ignore the fight or yield without a blow! Is this ‘Philosophy’—to shirk—forego All—best worth knowing—men most burn to know— This all we gain, O dapper One—from thee? ‘Appearances—the facts we feel and see— Sensuous impressions—these we know alone; Know even of these but the relations shown Between them; where they are alike, indeed, And in what settled order they proceed. Such sequences—resemblances—we call, When constant,—Laws of Things Phenomenal. As for the Cause directing each event, 'Tis but the one that next before it went; Like antecedent brings like consequent; And nothing supernatural ever breaks The natural course the ordered current takes; The endless train of pictures backward goes. But their essential nature—whence they rose— How first were caused or wherefore—no one knows, Has means or powers for knowing. Hence we deem All supersensuous notions a mere dream! And all religious dogmas, darkly bred From mumbo-jumbo worship—Fetish dread; And all Theologies that thence were spun From Gods the Many up to God the One; Expanding by the creature's natural law Of growth, still checked by less and less of awe, To subtler metaphysical conceits, (The grown-up Child's still self-deluding cheats)— All these are shadows of the cruder brain, Fancies the fullgrown Man must needs disdain; Gods—God—or Spirit—Nature's Abstract Whole— Her Plastic Force, or Vegetative Soul, All but ingenious whims of minds half-taught; All First or Final Causes—simply nought; To seek them, wanton waste of time and thought IX. “Nay, but”—drily hints his Mentor here, “What faults are you imputing! 'Tis a devotee, this dapper One! most reverent while uprooting! ‘Man must have a Faith,’ he cries, ‘some fine Ideal loved and followed! Hear then Heavens, O Earth give ear! Mankind and you shall still be hallowed With a spick-and-span new Creed, complete from Paradise to Tophet! Soft now! . . . There's no God but Abstract Man, and Comte's his Concrete Prophet! And to keep this compound Allah through his myriad parts progressing, There's in Fame a Life Immortal for each hero's goal and blessing; Blest or curst a Life Eternal for each soul of lowlier breeding, In the good effects or evil of each life on lives succeeding!’ Then he flaunts you his fantastic God—great—sad—perplexed Humanity! And, O sanguine sweet simplicity, most amiable Insanity! Thinks devotion to a Deity so wayward, weak and airy (Dying out behind for ever like a fire that scours a prairie) Will seduce poor Man to fling away his one brief chance of pleasure— Turn mere steel to ecstasies of sense, in Stoic over-measure; Spurn the Syren Vice for Virtue's pale and perishable treasure! All his joy the joy of healing by his pain the pain of others; Pebble vile for Self to smile the Pearl of price for Self-like brothers; Altar-flame when blown for them the hell-fire spark in Self he smothers! So his bubble-doom he shall sky-tinge; dog-futured—dog-like dutiful, Slave to make his firefly flash of life look solemn, grand and beautiful! So his brother dim Automatons of like ephemeral quality, Shall enshrine him, as in mockery of his wormy grave's reality, Crowned in catacombs of Memory with most mortal Immortality! Nay, for feigning Life so farcical,—grand, beautiful, and solemn, Soothe his dust, his dry bones tickle, with a statue, bust or column! ‘Were not this,’ the sleek one simpers, ‘guerdon great and prospect glorious? We are rotten, not forgotten! O the prize for pangs notorious! Nothingness our doom, no less we'll make believe 'tis tempting—winning; Life a skeleton—what then?—we'll pull a string and set it grinning!’” Canto the Fourth. Terra Firma. 1. Universe-solutions. 2, 3. The Atomic Theory and Evolution (4) tell nothing as to First Causes—of Motion or powers of Atoms; 5, or of Life, whose orderly Evolution required; in organisms Impulses towards it; and a World arranged for it—both provided beforehand: clear proof of ‘Mind.’ 6. Nature, as by her general system, so in her smallest works, proves this foresight. 7. Could Chance effect this?—theory too improbable. 8. Other considerations as to First Cause and Final Results; Means and Ends. What makes Law resemble Chance; and Necessity. 9. The fancy of ‘Mind-Stuff’ merely assumes Mind is Matter, which is inconceivable. 10. All these are Second Causes; make them First—you make them Divine. 11. All existence, then, originates in what we must call ‘Mind.’ 12. This Power more probably perfect than imperfect. 13. So Ranolf sticks to his ‘Theism.’ I. How many a sage has solved the Universe Yet left the wondrous Mystery none the worse! Hast seen a Lioness and Cubs at play? Look! she is down upon her side and they With noisy growl and harmless bite Are worrying her in their small way, Triumphant ramping o'er the creature dread; But on the least alarm or impulse slight, Lifting her haughty head, With easy paw she puts them all aside, And glares out fierce in majesty and pride!— The mighty Mother, Nature, in such sort Does with her philosophic children sport: O! they have got her wholly at their feet, Her mystery known, their mastery complete! Then, with some little fact or newer light, Quiet—disdaining even disdain— She throws them all abroad again; Reveals fresh depths to their astonished sight, Resumes her sacred secrecy and might, And reasserts her ancient reign. II. See Ranolf now with curious wonder whist, Listening a Sage high-towering, wiry-witted, German—a prime profound Materialist!— “O lynx-eyes lightening through each Logic-mist— Eyebrows with vehement fierce enquiry knitted— Nose wide-upturned, importunate; comprest Yet wistful working lips that never rest! He looks an intellectual Corkscrew—fitted To worm his wriggling and resistless way To Nature's tightest-bottled secrets! Play— Child's play, with that most penetrative muzzle Were his, to ferret out her mysteries—take The Universe to pieces, and remake— Put it together like a Chinese puzzle!” III. And what did this Machine, this Logic-Mill Grinding of mere necessity, not will, Turn out as flour the hungry Soul to fill? What drops of Truth did this Retort distil? “Atoms! you build the Universe, with Gravity and Motion! All Force is Force Mechanical; in Earth or Air or Ocean Or depths of Space, of Spirit-Force we have no need or notion! From Ether springs in Vortex-rings your being—your beginning; By knot or clot therein begot, you spirally go spinning! You clash, vibrate and generate Heat—your elastic quiver; For Light—you smite through Ether's night a billion-league-long shiver! You shrink and swell, attract—repel; heap single kinds in gases; Or in proportions rare—exact, combine your varied classes In molecules that join compact in elemental masses. But restless Chance forced some of you, now mutually repelling, In Æons past to mix and make one Molecule excelling Whose myriads formed a tissue fine with plastic powers indwelling— That ‘Protoplasm’ Light and Heat from their Sun-hidden sluices Streamed on and stung into self-multiplying cells and juices— Coaxed into creatures organised for simplest wants and uses. These Molecules, impelled at first by just that Force mechanic Which lifelike works in falling stones and crystals inorganic We christen ‘Plastidules’—such plastic vivid stuff providing;—” “O nothing like hard names in Greek, their weaker points for hiding When to foregone conclusions Wits o'er cracking ice are gliding! Here, crept in somehow while fine words our senses were beguiling, See Life, mysterious Stranger, stands beside us blandly smiling!”— A hint from Ranolf's Tutor this—his lecture-notes compiling. “Then Chance and outward Nature's force compelled slow variation In organs dowered with inward power of happy adaptation; And creatures owning these endured; the rest died out neglected; Defects from Sire to Son increased, or organs new perfected; Thus for survival in the end the fittest were selected; And Being's glorious cycle thus through all its grades unfolded, The lower still advanced to higher,—lured, fostered, fed and moulded, Or checked—killed off, as things around might well or badly suit them, And favouring Chance or frowning chose to ruin or recruit them, Till Monads grew to Man!—And whence his mighty Soul's resources? Sunclear!—Each Atom has a Soul—the sum of all its forces— Immutable—immortal—One—through all its myriad courses: Each kind through chance-alliances, vicissitudes, convulsions, Still true to its peculiar powers, attractions and repulsions. And Plastidules have Souls as well—each Soul an aggregation Of Souls of all the Atoms that it holds in combination; But fickle, complex, varied, ever changeable and changing; Through tangled files and piles on piles of finest fibre ranging,— Till Man's great Soul at last their whole complexities embraces! For Motion and Sensation are of all Soul-Life the bases; (Touch a mimosa-leaf—it shrinks, a crab—it slinks off sideways; To move—to feel, with Will—without, how close are their allied ways!) Brain-molecules of course have both; and when, like church-bells ringing, When stimulants, with nerves of sense for bell-ropes, set them swinging Up in the belfry-brain, their subtle shiftings and vibrations Are Consciousness and Thought, with all their endless commutations;—” “Hoho! but here methinks the Ice with thundering cracks is starry!”— “Down motor-nerves to muscles then, those tremors run nor tarry, But Thought to Voluntary Act by reflex working carry. And what are Likes—Dislikes?—Why, mere repulsions or attractions Nerve-atoms keep—the source of all emotions—passions—actions. As rose organic Life, the new accretions—complications Roused in responsive brain by new external needs—relations, Inherited, gave Instincts born with after generations: Till, say, the White Ant's wondrous care for ‘tribal welfare’—rising To moral worth that weal required—the brain still aggrandizing, In Man to ‘Conscience’ soared at last, and ‘Duty’ self-despising!— Yes! 'tis brain-atom-groups upbuild your stormy rage, you Tyrant! Their countless links of forces forge your hopes, O heaven-aspirant! While passion-atoms in your brain, pale Lover, 'tis, that pester That blooming pile of Molecules (whose powers as such attest her, Repelling while attracting too) your lovely peace-molester!” IV. “Brilliant that Evolution-theory!” cried The youth's hard-headed, sceptical old Guide; “Famous that Atom-creed (from India brought)— But yet to solve the Eternal Mystery—nought! “For whence came ‘Motion’ first? what is the Force Which Motion gives to Matter in its course, Or what when lying hid in Matter stayed? And how is ‘Heat’ by mere vibrations made? What sudden mystic transformation serves To make them in that way affect our nerves We label ‘Heat’? or can they tell aright How undulating Ether gives us ‘Light’?— The cause—nay, mode of all is lost in Night! “Then whence came ‘Atoms’? whence their power to change As Elements both form and essence?—Strange! Here are accomplished Beings, skilled to tell Both friends and foes when rushing on pell-mell; Myriads that most in puzzling drill excel, In cunning multiples attract—repel, And practise pure Arithmetic so well! A petty Pantheon of fine Godlets, see! Making a miniature Mythology, With furious loves, hates, powers, a set apiece, And transformations weird that never cease, Out-metamorphosing the Gods of Rome or Greece!— Could Matter or Mechanic Force, in fact Such chemic, mental feats originate—enact? V. “Next, whence came ‘Life’? and Life's ascending scale?— For this, could Atoms and their Sphere avail?— Well, that amazing Plastidule admit Could start Life-forms—the Sphere around to fit, (Though how Life sprung from Matter, Science gives No hint—from lifeless things gets nought that lives;) Grant, for such Forms to rise from grade to grade That working wise Environment must aid, Could modulate on such harmonious plan The golden course the mighty Music ran Till ‘closed the diapason full in Man;’ Still—if Life-germs and that wise Sphere indeed Could to this grand array of Being lead, Two things perforce their action must precede: First—an unbounded impulse and desire In living things to rise still higher and higher In orderly ascent; on every hand To spread on system—normally expand; A self-constructing power to seize and hold All from which aptest organs it could mould, And let the germs of ampler life unfold: And next, a World—forefashioned to refuse All that erroneous tendencies might use— Disorder need; forefraught with all supplies For wants that made its tenants fitly rise— For ordered Progress pre-arranged,—Earth, Seas and Skies! “Was there not here an End—that guided—swayed— Means from the first so suitably arrayed To reach results so complex—well-defined?— And what is this but Forethought—Purpose—Mind?” VI. Notes from lectures or from reading; Talk between those two succeeding— Student led and Tutor leading, May we offer—not unheeding Task of pruning—lopping—weeding? Free Nature! how careless, confiding! Half playfully, furtively hiding Truths ever momentous, abiding, In her least or her lowliest works! There assurance of Power presiding— Foreseeing—forethinking—foreguiding— In silence and secrecy lurks! Think of the foresight proved in that small fact— Next century's oak within an acorn packed! But ‘Mummy-corn’! O greater wonder hid Than from the summit of its Pyramid Those famous ‘Forty Ages’ saw or did! Rome rose—toiled through long glories—slow decay; Still, seeming dead, that grain's-germ ready lay To shoot, a blade—a beautiful green birth Soon as it touched ev'n England's warm moist earth! Truly this Life-in-death with new life fired, Some ‘knowledge of affinities’ required— Some lasting holdfast to an end desired! What sense in sense-less tissue there can be! Mark—in a tiny mote you scarce can see ‘The movement to achieve an end precedes And makes the organ for the end it needs.’ A floating jelly-speck in filmy skin— Protean globule changing form at will— Borne on by currents that revolve within, Wraps itself round the mite of food it meets And turns into a stomach! Feat of feats! How do such prescient impulses begin?— Mark other jellied sea-motes simpler still, Where neither limb nor organ you espy, Nor any structure Science can detect, Expanding into spider-webs, erect Shell-marvels of minutest masonry That for ingenious geometric skill With mightiest Angelo's or Wren's may vie;— How do such impulses such ends fulfil? ‘Fancy the antenatal human Ear!’ (Says one consummate Master of Thought severe) ‘In secret framed—of microscopic size— That grand Piano of three thousand strings, Each to distinct vibrations fitly tuned Of the outer air with which it ne'er communed, Anticipates all Music's melodies.’ What! had the Cause from which this marvel springs No mental power to regulate—review All the relations of these complex things— Purposely make them each to each so true? But say, through Æons film by film 'twas spun, With power to breed it passed from Sire to Son;— By greater prescience then the end was won. O wise dorr-beetle! you make fit supply For eggs you lay the moment ere you die; Look forward to results with foresight keen— From want beforehand will an offspring screen You and your ancestors have never seen; With means most apt unconsciously achieve Ends you know nothing of, nor could conceive! Is there no Power to which your wants were known? No guidance here—or sense beyond your own? See working Bees, from whom their Queen has flown, A sexless grub with ‘royal jelly’ feed, And make it ‘grow a Queen’ new swarms to breed! Could all the Reason, Science, Skill of Man, Working their utmost since the World began, Work towards an End upon a subtler plan Or surer, than these brainless Insects can? VII. “Dear Matter-mongers! what, another God To cap the crew created by your nod; His work all this;—nor better work nor worse Than when he tumbled out the Universe— That rich result of Atoms in their dance, That Chaos tossed to Cosmos by mere—Chance! “Chance—Chance!”—O do not too irreverent deem The youth, if wider teachings through him sent A little thrill of mocking wonderment At this superb idea of Chance Supreme: 1 “Come any Muse of—Fog! your fond voice raise! Chant to great Chance some—disenchanting praise! He said: ‘Against Resistance Pressure strained Through Space, while Atom-showers in myriads rained: I bade the glorious hurly-burly whirl, The clusters cling, the Dervish-dances twirl; I—hounding on the boundless blindman's-buff, To build the Universe was God enough!’— Sufficing God—this Chance! 2 “‘Prime Wizard I and King of Conjurors; say Cardpacks by millions mixed before me lay; No skill I used—no care to look or learn— No knowledge of their sequences to spurn Wrong combinations or the right retain; All sleight of hand I scorned and craft of brain; I shuffled—shuffled; twas my only spell— And all—hey-presto! into Order fell!’— Astounding God—this Chance! 3 “‘My happiest hazard bade this beauteous scheme With forces every-way responsive teem; Inspired the living plastic power that dwells Expert in Atoms, Molecules, and Cells; Their infinite propensities to strain Towards ends they so triumphantly attain; To pile up organs multiplied—as means On means—to compass intricate machines!’— Inventive God—this Chance! 4 “‘I gave the Elements the power and skill To keep these Life-Machines ascending still; Gave Earth and Seas and Skies the genius rare Discreetly to select—extinguish—spare; Made them a mould to shape each cunning cast, Each newer marvel nobler than the last; Gave Life and Nature answering powers, till both Flashed forth the million miracles of—growth!’— Aspiring God—this Chance! 5 “‘Lo! all results of all I did—not planned— All of one kind, as all successful, stand! No blots about my blind creations lurk; No failures e'er disgraced my witless work; My creatures no incongruous mixtures marred; From all vagaries every race I barred; From ways aberrant warded cell and seed; Set limits to varieties of breed!’— Methodic God—this Chance! 6 “‘My luck to no gross junctions lapsed or led— Harpy or Centaur or Empusa dread! In Earth's rock-depths on record never left Worse malformations than a monstrous Eft; No botch or bungle since my work began— The monstrous Eft a miracle—like Man! E'en forms extinct ordained due part to play In one unfolding harmonised array!’— Unerring God—this Chance! 7 “‘But O! of miracles the crown and cream— Of my elaborate accidents supreme! The brain I made from sense so subtly free That first discovered it was made by Me! O skill my suicidal skill to beat And deify myself by self-defeat! What other God such deadliest foe could frame To turn High-Priest to glorify his name?’— Surely no God—but Chance!” VIII. And then that old Enquirer, who His free conclusions calmly drew From facts alone his foes held true, Would thus from time to time anew The apologetic strain pursue. O shining Apostles of Matter, If in antitheistical panic Effete superstitions you shatter, In Chance and your Forces Mechanic No Cause that is Primal you gain! All notion from Nature dissever Of Cause then (an idle endeavour!) Or confess:—for the meanest of Forces Which up to that rank you would strain— Though but Motion's first faint indication; Or, for something it holds in relation— Say the Scene of its earliest stirring, Beforehand—throughout—and for ever Prepared for its sure operation; Though too subtle that scene for sensation, Any feeling, or seeing or hearing:— You assume all the skill—the resources, All the purpose to compass whatever The final results may contain! ‘Your Newton's—Shakspeare's genius—('tis allowed) Were latent once within a fiery cloud!’— The marvel is, what from the first impelled And guided onward in the course they held Blind forces through all mazes—tangles—ties— Till to such grand achievements they could rise; Made from the first each step involve the next, Unchecked—unfoiled—unfailing—unperplexed! Find Being's slight beginnings slighter still, Through ampler Æons creeping, if you will; The less the means that lead to mighty ends The more the Power employing them transcends; The grand results themselves the slowlier grown, The greater is the Prescient Purpose shown! Chance is no Chance that works out wonders fine As matchless Skill or Forethought could design. But Law seems Chance, when Law's great system lends All means it lets occur their destined ends: Makes special ends that seem to fail, no less New means to some more general success. The Power that plays the game of Nature knows All the results of all the dice he throws: Whate'er turns up, it is to him the same; High throws or low alike advance his game: No lawless tampering with the dice he needs, When such the game that every throw succeeds! Necessity's no less an idle dream, Though all results inevitable seem. Law seems Necessity, if Will decree That no exception to its Law shall be! Necessity! its very name implies 'Tis an Effect itself, and must arise From some compelling Cause beyond itself that lies. IX. But here's a new material forged! enough To work these wonders all alone—‘Mind-Stuff!’ ‘Each molecule of Matter has a germ Of Mind attached called Mind-Stuff (mark the term) Not Mind itself—but with its likes combined, Able, so subtly linked, to turn to Mind!’ Well, not the prior question to discuss, Whence came the ‘germ,’ and who attached it thus? Here Science must a miracle endorse, Or beg the point unproved (‘no Spirit-Force Exists’)—assume it as a thing of course.— Mind-Stuff!—Thought-Matter say; Death-Life; Black-White! Can hyphens make all Nature's darkness—light? You join two names—(but what is that when done?) Of things unknown to prove them known—and one! Or is Mind, Matter?—If on that you rest, Give us three feet of Love (as children jest) Which lest some cubic inch of Envy mar, Hermetically seal it in a jar! ‘Ten times a Thought!’—bottle the product! Say How many scruples weighty Reasons weigh! Or polarise a flash of Wit, and find At what nice angle Fancy's rays inclined Start true reflections—off a polished Mind! X. Attraction—Atoms—Plastidules—'tis clear— Impulsive organs—upward-guiding Sphere— Motion—Necessity—or aught behind Of simpler Force that you could feign or find— All Second Causes these—whereby the First Is of no jot of Might or Mind amerced. But if to make them First your Faith incline, Or make Mind, Matter's self; such Faith in fine But shifts to them or this the powers divine Old creeds to their ‘Creators’ would assign. XI. Yes! it seems—to one conclusion No ingenious shift—illusion— Should the Reason blind; One great Fact defies rebuttal:— All Existence, simple, subtle, Points you with behest imperious To a Source, profound, mysterious, Ne'er to be defined; Yet of Might so transcendental, All the Powers that men call ‘mental’ Are its dim reflections merely, Glimmerings of a Glory clearly Inexpressible more nearly Than as ‘Primal Mind’! XII. Yet of this First Intelligence confessed Ineffable, may nought be fairly guessed? Can we in sober reason think or feign The ALL an Imperfection? or maintain The Absolutely Perfect, an Ideal, A Fancy, nowhere actual proved or real? But say 'tis realised; what wonder we Seeing so little of that All should be Unable to discern how what is styled ‘Evil’ by us, through Nature running wild, Can be with such Perfection reconciled? A full round Moon the Universal Scheme, We catch the Crescent's ragged golden gleam; In Man's wide Faiths if hoary Light be found Would feebly reillume the faded round, Faint reflex of far glory!—'tis mayhap Real as that ‘old Moon in the new Moon's lap’! But since on two great negatives profound Science and Metaphysics are at one, And all their mightiest Masters most renowned— Grant Darkness all its grandeur—own that none Can prove ‘Divine Existence’ cannot be; While for its ‘nature,’ all alike agree Your Kants and Newtons, Doctors wigged and gowned, Helpless as smockfrocked Hobnail at his plough, Baffled before that mystery must bow; On what compulsion must good sense allow That this Unknown ‘First Cause’ in deed or will Has just but so much power for good and ill As in the Universe we see displayed? When even the fraction seen of Power—Skill—Mind— Say in that play of Atoms, so transcends All human estimate, even Science ends Her coolest quest bewildered and half blind? Were it not then a paradox most strange Should finite Mind, thus paralysed before Its best-proved Actual, limit and degrade All possible Existence to the range Of what its impuissance can conceive? We say, nor—Sages Positive!—ignore What truths you teach, 'tis harder to believe That which has done so much cannot do more And all the Evil that exists retrieve With compensating Good somewhere in store— Than that the fault lies with the human Mind, Too weak or lowly-placed the cause to find Why from the first throughout the Universe The best has not excluded all the worse. And more preposterous it is to dream The Universe is an abortive scheme, Worked by a Power unequal to its task, Or its presumed incompetence to mask, Than that the vast Obscure which round us lies, Somehow—somewhere—the Being must comprise Our most exalted Nature must demand; Reality than our Ideal more grand; And therefore, in some way least understood, Nay, which the Finite could not understand,— Perfectly wise—just—powerful—loving—good! To Reason less repugnant seems this creed, And less credulity than theirs to need Who for ‘First Cause’ in blind Momentum trust, Or find Divinity in finer dust. XIII. Thus have we faintly shadowed forth How, tutored by a Mind, sagacious, deep With the true sceptic caution of the North, Apt by no Master's word to swear, nor let The current of a Creed in fashion sweep Firm Reason off her feet whate'er its set, How, for a Soul so led—bold—healthy—bright As his—the Sea-bred Youth's of whom we write, The young fresh faith in so-called ‘God’—that came From deeper depths than Logic's, as before Sprung greenly through Doubt's furnace, and no more Shrivelled or shrunk in scientific blight, Than dewy grass through window-panes descried Waving unscorched in vivid flickering flame Reflected from the fire that burns inside. Canto the Fifth. Cloud-blowing. 1. Talk about the ‘Soul’—and ‘Immortality.’ 2. Ideal result of the work of an Ideally Divine Power—ultimate bliss for all. 3. Does ‘Evolution’ preclude Immortality? 4. Spirit-Life not excluded by the Material Universe, as (5) There may be an Unseen Universe beyond; or after; or (6) within this One—since Matter may refine to Spirit. 7. Is not ‘Cosmical Energy’ the outcome of Omnipotent Will? and (8) akin to Thought and Will in Man; both, emanations of Infinite Will? 9. This Will the Power that informs all Nature—‘Personality’ its clearest display. The union of this last with Matter being utterly inexplicable—what do we know of it when separated? how be sure it may not still exist? Want of sensuous experience of it no disproof. May not new organs await it even in the Atomic Universe? 10. Soul-truths perhaps only to be found and proved by Emotions. 11. That Man should rise by the False—a discord in Nature. 12. What makes the scheme of Existence rational, it is rational to hold true. 13. What if Immortality should have to be proved by a practical ‘reductio ad absurdum’ of its denial? 14. Hope. I. “The silvery dews on the meadows are blending Like gauze with the gold of the buttercups' gleam; The hawthorn is scenting the hollow green ways; Its masses all snowy with blossom depending Are sunlit emerging from faintly blue haze Like a delicate dream! O the leaflets—how innocent, frank, their unfolding; What a sweet hidden twitter—the birds' callow speech! Two loud muffled notes like a flute's—how they stray! 'Tis the Cuckoo—his weariless plaint still upholding— Still calling for something still further away— For a joy out of reach! See the framework of traceried jet overshingled With emerald scales, jewel-roofing of Spring! Over canopy canopy brilliantly spread, Made of gems, the transparent and shadowy mingled!— —Just the Elm—with new leaves, and the Sun overhead; 'Tis a tent for a King!” So Ranolf; beckoning to a settle rude His Tutor, as their musings they pursued. The youngster, drinking into heart and brain Elastic freshness from the fragrant Morn, Could not but launch out in a cheery strain, As on the ‘Soul’ they touched—‘Immortal Life,’ (O noblest themes with direst discords rife!) Treating Despair almost with joyous scorn.— Sanguine, say you, his temper!—If his blood Coloured his reasoning, haply 'twas as good As props the atrabiliar doctrines dyed So darkly on the melancholic side. We ground on those mudbanks of Doubt alone In the ebb of the world's heart or our own; Tangled in shallows of Despondence dark Only when life is at low-water mark. Not in Man's healthiest, his completest state Do such misgivings his wise joys abate: For Confidence is Life—and Hope is health: And youth's glad trust is worth most mental wealth! II. “What! will they say our hopeful trust is blind! That the Heart's sunshine needs the clouded Mind! Must Reason then be spurned from her high seat, Or that most natural passion held a cheat? That thirst for deathless life, that high desire With which all wakened Intellects aspire, As the dread Serpent of Eternity Had bitten them with fangs like those accurst Once fabled of the Dipsas—causing thirst That quenchless burnt for ever! must this be Held a mere lure to lead the human race Through the long ages to some loftier place, And from the myriad generations spent And wasted in the wearisome ascent, Evolve some sample of consummate skill Whom powers with instincts harmonized should fill— The clearest Reason and the purest Will? That perfect race—must it, too, have its day, Rise, growth, and culmination, and decay, Then, like its predecessors, pass away? Say, does ‘Supreme Intelligence’ contrive A million shifts this vast machine to drive, Only at such a failure to arrive? Can neither check illusive Hope's uprise, Nor make the illusion's fathomless disguise At least impervious to poor human eyes? What ‘Mind Divine’ would show for one short hour Such want, yet waste, of Goodness and of Power? If such the Universe, at once declare Some Demon-Bungler has been busy there; Willing and yet too clumsy to deceive, Creating spirits to aspire and grieve And die without redemption or reprieve! And not this World's,—this human race alone— But all the Soul-drifts—countless throngs unknown In many an unimaginable Star Whirled round unnumbered Suns that shine afar! Myriads on myriads fleeting like a breath, Endless vicissitude of Life and Death; The swarming star-shoals coming—going—whence Or whither? without object in the dense Infinitude of futile impotence! “Nor boots it that the central Primal Cause Itself might boast of permanence or pause, Be an ‘Eternal Now’—a ‘Boundless Here,’ If all his emanations gone and spent And every fleeting vain development, Though after million Æons disappear Left neither in a Seen or Unseen Sphere! No! any ‘Mind’ I would believe or teach As Power Supreme, Divine, Eternal, One, Should be at lowest competent to reach, And to eternise ere his work were done, The good of All through happiness of Each! Each life progressive and the last result In bliss unqualified should all exult; Perfect as well as permanent should be Creation's glorious Crown and every glad degree! III. “But does that beauteous Evolution scheme Prove Man's great Hope a too ambitious dream?” “Why think,” the Elder said, “it should or can? Prove if you will the human race began Far off in Manlike Ape or Apelike Man; Detect or fancy links that would annul Diversities in shape of bone or skull; Prove Conscience, Sense of Duty, Right and Wrong, From self-preserving instincts, weak or strong, Tribal or Individual, slowly came; Are not Man's soaring spirit and its claim, Its maker, mystery, miracle, the same As if in that more vulgar conjuring way He sprang at one great leap from ruddy clay?— 'Tis not what height he rose from, but the height He reaches—makes Man need the Infinite; 'Tis not his birthright—but the Soul he sways When born—such need into a Hope must raise!”— IV. Said Ranolf, “What about the notion With which some potent Pundits batter Their foes, in obstinate devotion To one absorbing hobby—Matter— That in the Universe around No ‘room for Spirit’ can be found?” The Old Man from his poke outdrew His pipe and tapped the ashes out, Filled it from twisted pouch anew, For ‘Lucifers’ then felt about, And lit it with the third-struck match, As half-delayed by lurking doubt; Then from his pursed lips slowly blew A whiff of smoke, and seemed to watch How from its centre it would curl Outward in circles, then o'erhead In dainty spirals float and spread: “Just like their wondrous vortex-whirl Of Atom-rings”—he smiling said; Then gently, taking circuit wide, Yet half impatiently replied: V. “What! no room for your ‘Soul-Life’ they say? so with Atoms and Vortices packed Is your Ether, no Space is there left for your ‘Ghosts’ to exist in or act? Might a dullard presume but to ask, while on this side or that side they brawl, Can their utmost sagacity prove that the Universe Seen is the All? Think of ‘Energy’—mystical wonder! an Infinite Ocean of Force Through the visible Universe flying—of Heat, Light and Motion the Source! Though to active or latent it change, in amount undiminished it flows; Indestructible then and Eternal?—but who can its wellspring disclose? From the Sun ever effluent—true: but to Him from what fountain effused? What becomes of it all? but a part in the visible Universe used, While the bulk of it rushes at speed inconceivable—whither away?— Nay the part—must it quench in this Cosmos its Æons on Æons of play? The conditions it works in, for ever be just what you find them to-day? Must the whirl of the planets wax fainter and fainter till into the Sun They are plunged, and the Suns on their mightier centres be dashed one by one, At each crash upward-flinging a billion-years' flicker of quickening heat Efflorescent in Worlds ever fewer, the whirl and the waste to repeat Till the last on a measureless cinder-heap sink and—the Farce be complete? Must the Universe-Fire—enormous—æonian—burn itself out, And the Energy cease when it dies? Shall a failure so infinite flout At the last this ineffable wonderful outflow of purposeless Might?— Better think it may well from and wend to some Universe hidden from sight! VI. “Need we ask if that Universe elsewhere in Space—this familiar one—be? Or a new kind of Space to be measured more ways than our hampering ‘Three?’ Or belike in a kind of Existence by Space and by Time unconfined, In the thoroughly ‘Absolute?’ both of them blanks to our limited Mind? Why, the Cosmos whose surface we see, what behind it may lurk or within?— Up from solids to liquids, from liquids to gases, still subtler, more thin, Look how Matter refines; then as fluid Electric, as Light or as Heat, Or their medium Ether, half loses its nature; and lastly its height Of pure subtilty—rather the point where it possibly vanishes quite— Gravitation—Attraction, attains: while the finer of every grade Can the grosser, it seems, interpenetrate, permeate, freely pervade! Who shall say then, where ‘Spirit’ begins, where the merely Material ends? Must that process refining be stopped where our limited ken it transcends? To Existences pure, immaterial, rather believe it pursued, Which the presence of Matter nowise from the place that it filled would exclude!— So may thousands of Worlds all of Spirit no twinkle or flame would betray Through the starry expanses (if Spirit need any locality) stray, Or each other pervade intermingling, in rest unimpeded or flight, Unperceived, undetected, unknown,—a Universe hidden from sight!” VII. A cliff-top lone and high; A noon-day soft and calm; Sea melting into sky; Sky into liquid balm; Horizon lost!— The vast expanse how bare! Unmoving, here and there, Clouds floating on the Sea, Ships white-sailed, hung in Air, Four—five at most: How tiny each—a toy Upon the pale blue, fair, Silent Immensity! —So better to enjoy Their dreamy talk, Our Student and his Guide, He of the shaggy hair Snow-white—the weary-eyed, Now on the cliff-top bare Together walk. “But for Power?” the latter was saying, “Can we who are forced to believe That the First Cause of All is Intelligence greater than Man can conceive— Guess the mode of its Power?—Just think of the Force in this Cosmos we trace: This Earth flying miles as we speak it, a thousand a minute through Space! In a second from Pole to Equator Auroral effulgences leap! Then the billion-leagued shudders of Light, how they speed through the Infinite Deep! Yet beside Gravitation—Attraction, all these may but linger and creep! Ever swifter, more subtile, intense grows the Power that recedes and ascends; To Omnipotence still and Ubiquity nearer and nearer it tends! What should stay its progression—that Power expanding, intensified still, At the point where we cease to perceive?—But confess, to Omnipotent ‘Will,’ As of Force the sole fountain our reason can reach, ere the quest must be stanched, We may follow, and fairly, the Might that across the Immensities launched Wafts a million of Worlds on its breath in a sprinkle of galaxy-spray, And can weave the gold meshes of Life our Earth-speck is webbed with to-day!— So this Cosmos itself of that Will were the outcome, expression and sign, Were its infinite-spreading and endlessly-ramified Instrument, Shrine, And myriad-organed Embodiment ever and wholly divine! Worked from some inconceivable Source, say, of mental or physical Light— Inconceivable truly, but real,—in the Universe hid or in sight! VIII. “Two Mysteries freely confest by the sages of Science we find:— Through the visible Universe clearly an ‘Energy’ works like a Mind; For the grasp of the Senses too fine: never known but with Atoms combined; Never caused by these Atoms—for how can dead Matter originate Force? And how linked with the Universe ever a Mystery dark as its source.— Through the brain of Mankind works an ‘Energy’—Thought call it—Consciousness—Will; Never known but when joined with brain-atoms; itself imperceptible still; Never caused by these Atoms,—for how can mere Matter, though living—be Thought? And how linked with the Brain such a secret, in vain is the clue to it sought.— Are they kindred these ‘Energies’ then? and the last, what if simply 'twere true 'Tis a drop of its Ocean, the first, and as such indestructible too! Why—of Matter one mightiest Mystagogue—vaunted of Theists a rod— A candid and fearless fine creature whose only one bugbear was—‘God,’— Whose disgust with dead Ghosts in the Sky made him blot out the sky for the sod— Has recorded of this very ‘Thought’—in its Essence who deepliest delves Must acknowledge it one and the same with the Essence of Things-in-Themselves— Of this Universe then! and 'tis clear that the happy result undesigned Of his proving them both to be Matter—is proving them both to be Mind! Soul-Energy then and the Cosmical—are they not both of one kind?— Of ‘Omnipotent Will,’ say, but streamlets or filaments, ample or slight? The immediate Effluence then of that Essence Divine, which aright To reveal—though divinely bedimmed lest its naked transcendency smite On perception too finite and feeble with splendour unbearably bright— Is the use of this Garment of God—this Universe ever in sight? IX. “Aye indeed, 'tis Intelligent Power—Omnipotent Will, as it seems, Feeds the ‘Energy’ mystic which through this molecular Universe streams, And can guide or unite with—inform—all its Forces in all their degrees, And impart just so much of itself as its purpose or wisdom may please; From its lowest display—Gravitation—your Newton and Locke call ‘divine,’ Up through sensuous impress and impulse instinctive till clearest it shine In the Conscience and Will of Mankind. Surely this, well may Reason maintain Is the ‘Soul’ in the Atoms the fancy or faith of that German would feign— Is the ‘Mind-Stuff’ to molecules joined—in the rock—in the plant—in the brain!— But the union of Body with Thought, if Man has no faculties fit, Says Science, its Nature to tell; on the truth can he possibly hit Of what follows their severance? hidden the link—and not knowing a whit Of the Essence of either when linked—are we hopelessly forced to admit That Man's Personality—peerless on lofty-willed Conscience its throne— Of that Energy ever divine the divinest Investiture known— Could not live though the link should be broken—its vassal and vehicle gone?— O we never have known it—forsooth! with Experience inch-deep at best!— Why, the truth of what lies beyond Sense, say how should the Senses attest! The invisible has not been seen, the inaudible heard! 'tis confest: But o'erdone by the surface of things as we helplessly dabble and glower, In such Infinite Mystery plunged—in the hands of such Infinite Power, Can we tell, do you think, all that Power may do to combine and to change Even Atoms through millions of Worlds that from solar to nebular range, Though a thread of its working in them with its work on our Earth-speck may blend? While between what our microscopes show and the bounds to which Atoms extend, Even here, are such structural wonders—complexities,—change without end, As the keenest sagacity stagger—the finest conceptions transcend. Can we tell what is possible, then, or impossible either, to Might Such as that, with such Essence as Mind—in a realm imperceptible quite, Though within their molecular bounds—in the Universe plainly in sight?—” X. “Yet after all”—and here the wary old Campaigner in the war against Despair Fell back upon a fortress he would hold When Reason's forces seemed too hardly prest, Rearing a broader banner in brighter air And sounding notes that like a bugle's blare Triumphant echoes woke in Ranolf's breast: “Whate'er that Unknown Realm—of Spirit whole Or matter wholly past perception—be, That hiding-place and homestead of the Soul; Its nature and mysterious destiny; If entrance 'tis impossible to gain For Science to that royal-rich domain, And Intellect alone be found too poor A tool to burst the Imperial Palace-door, (Though I must think the expanding range allowed To Man's Experience will supply some day A basis, starting-point or link whereby Science Demonstrative will pierce the cloud And back with glittering spoil come laden gloriously!) But if this may not be, why fear to say The Soul, its sphere and nature must be such— For Intellect thereon to logicise Is just to try rich colours with the touch, Or test melodious sounds with keen bright eyes; As Dante's heard the sculptured Widow's speech—. On that white frieze-like Purgatorial bank Whose end each way his eyesight could not reach— Ask death for her son's murderer as she sank At Trajan's feet, and ceased not to beseech Till his roused virtue had vouchsafed her prayer; Then saw the sound of visible replies The marble Emperor made her voiceless cries. That feat we would not ape, but rather dare Confess that in an atmosphere so rare The leaden wing of Logic cannot rise; That by Emotion, not Reflection, best The Soul is borne aloft in that fine air— Feeling, not Thought, her fiery chariot there! The highest Sentiment were then confest The base whereon the highest Truth must rest; The highest Truth itself, not such—about Whose sureness 'twere impossible to doubt; But as to sureness, in the next degree, Such as, not proved, most probable might be: True till a higher Truth were felt or found And by the beating hearts of men around As such accepted—welcomed—honoured—crowned; Still raised, refined, as Science purged away What Error in her reach obscured its ray; Aught from that lower realm that might alloy Its gold, would Logic fasten on—destroy; And everything she honestly disproved, Must be relinquished—howsoe'er beloved: With one proviso, proved default of proof Is from disproof a million leagues aloof. “Let us cling then, my lad, to that glimpse of a Truth about Truth we have caught, That Emotions may teach it as well as Sensations. Aye! perish the thought ‘What we feel with the fingers is all—what we feel with the heart shall be nought!’ That the heart and the soul reach beyond all the senses is ever confest; Then for what lies beyond all the senses, their evidence must be the best. And if many, the best and the deepest to feel and to think, can arrive By emotions most pure to that grandest conviction—the Soul shall survive, Such a theorem rightly they prove, do they not? from premises read Not in reasons but feelings alone—Q.E.D. of the heart, not the head?— XI. “There's a ‘Tendency making for Righteousness:’ True! which abundantly proves A ‘Supreme Moral Power’ exists; all the more that so slowly it moves, So accords with the gradual processes physical Nature so loves. If to physical Harmony—Order, the Universe wins as a whole, May not Order and Harmony Moral be fixed for its loftier goal?— Now the thinkers and feelers—those best and profoundest, sincerely declare With such Power—of Reason all perfect and Will the divinest—to share Inexpressible inner communion, purifies, elevates most The Spirit that yearns to be like it. We know too, the pride and the boast Of their race—the magnificent Souls who have loftiest towered through Time, By the depth of their love of that Power have been stirred up and strengthened to climb— And through faith in Immortal Existence, have soared to that climax sublime! What! did Man o'er those animal cycles to royal pre-eminence rise But by stimulants—impulses true—true outer and inner supplies, Yet by means that are false and illusive to moral perfection must tower— True Sun and true Air make the plant, mock Sun and sham Air make its flower! Are not forces through Nature the nobler, to nobler productions that tend? And shall Man by the false and deceptive, most truly the lower—ascend? Can His upward be really Her downward? one refluent wave can he be— Flowing back 'mid the millions that run right-ahead in the Universe-Sea? Is he placed topsy-turvy, as 'twere, with harmonious Nature at strife— Like a slide set by chance upside-down in the rich Magic-Lantern of Life? XII. “Look! here's an arrangement for Being—half-finished; a scheme incomplete; By itself, full of outrage on Justice and Love; a remorseless deceit For the high aspirations it rouses; a jargon, a nightmare, a cheat! Like a Nineveh fragment of tile, nicked all over with arrow-head lines, Broken off through the middle of each—a farrago of meaningless signs. Comes a cuneate Linguist profound, fills the lines up with words he has guessed, With ‘Survival of Soul,’ ‘Probation by Evil,’ ‘Reward’ and the rest, Till it seems all consistent and rational, beautiful, wisest and best! Were it sensible then, or wild whim, to believe the lost half of the tile Was o'ernicked by the Ancient Clay-writer with words in a similar style, To be found, when they dig up the whole of the mighty Assyrian pile? XIII. “'Tis my faith—should this Soul-Life, my lad, in the Intellect's hotter attacks Melt away like a counterfeit flower Superstition has modelled in wax, And the Heart could not rear the live blossom,—yet Nature and Fate would be heard— Would ‘reduce’ its denial at last to a crushing, terrific ‘absurd;’ Let Mankind down a withering process of practical Logic be hurled; Prove by vivid Experience how,—mortal-soulled—a mere animal World To a Bedlam and Chaos must come—universal putridity—rot! So be forced to assume Immortality—hold it Humanity's lot— Whether ‘Logic’ the truth of the Fact could directly demonstrate or not! XIV. “Life's the green Cone-cap hiding for its hour That golden Californian poppy-bud; Death pulls it off—outbursts the Soul—the flower!”— (So mused that time-worn Sage)—“The Soul when freed From its environment of flesh and blood Will flush into full-blooming power The riddle of its folded fate to read.— See the dilating Sun Down to the mountains sunk! An awful human Eye Beneath such sable brows— Cloud-stripes like Cedar-boughs Soft-floated off some giant trunk Of ancient Lebanon. Why are you watching there, O great red Mystery—why?— Just as—with ominous glare Yet grandly—solemnly sublime, O'er mortal Life and fleeting Time, Watches Eternity! —Watches; and yet can throw A magic mellowed glow Of Hope o'er Life's mysterious doom, As balmy Evening's soothing gloom You sanctify—illume!— The sandbank of the Sea-lagoon You glorify to gold; Crimson the jet-white sandbirds—soon To cease their restless run, and fold Their wings on sea-roost cold. I saw you rise this Morn. On the black Mountain's rim there came Some little tongues of shifting flame; They linked—a dome grew slow in sight, Then throbbed—a sphere of blinding light! Low down, right opposite,— The wan full Moon, dead-white, Disconsolate—forlorn, Lingered in shy retreat To see what glad reception might Her dazzling rival greet. —So looks poor Faith at Science. Yet Why should she at the splendour fret, (I thought) the glory shun? Her turn will come; that rival bright Will fill—or own her full of light Ere all be done!” Canto the Sixth. Land-Life or Sea-Life? 1. Choice of a profession. 2. ‘Physic.’ 3. ‘Law.’ 4. ‘Divinity.’ 5. Again to Sea. 6. Sea-sketches. Sunset on the Line. 7. A luminous Sea. 8. An Iceberg. I. O blest escape from psychologic Quest And metaphysic Sieves for sifting air! Life-theories and their seesaw Swing at rest, Life's livelier Roundabout on earth to share!— Not unamused, ‘in that obscure sojourn Though long detained,’ our Optimist must turn To some profession now, and haply learn How in the hungry press of strugglers best The means of life his own right hand may wrest. But better is the narrow humble sphere Which sets from childhood's days before the eyes Some calling which to climb to were a prize, Which, difficult to win, is therefore dear— Than wider means which leave the cultured lad Himself to choose what path of life to run; Let Fancy tell what Duty should be done, Make worthless what can be for wishing had, And prove how too much choice is worse than none. And this felt Ranolf—puzzled sore to name Church—Physic—Law—which most attractive seemed, Or rather least repulsive should be deemed. II. What marvellous study like the human frame! What webs and tissues by that living loom Woven to rarest texture, richest bloom; What wefts and warps of flexile ducts that wind In never-tangled courses intertwined; What mechanisms intricate, exact, In orderly profusion ranged and packed; What cunning cordage curiously inlaced; What delicate engines of supply and waste; What fine concoctions and witch-juices strange For metamorphosis and magic change; What subtlest forces balanced and combined; Leaving poor human skill so far behind, All Art seems artless, all Invention blind! (Wonders, all Chance! some wondrous Sages say!) But then how saddening, that superb array No more in healthy and harmonious play, But festering in disorder and decay! What grander triumph can Experience show Than the cool Surgeon's, who in conquering strife With fell disease, with science-guided knife Dares open wide the dreadful door of Life Some perilous moments, and his dexterous feat Of desperate rescue rapidly complete With sure decisive stroke, lest the grim Foe Should entrance gain and all his work o'erthrow! “Aye!” thought our student, with a transient glow, “For object so exalted who denies The labour of a life were well bestowed? But then, alas! to that proud power the road Through fetid chambers of Dissection lies Whereat a very Ghoul's foul gorge would rise.” III. Well, cannot Law awake some genuine spark Of true ambition—pay for patient toil? What spectacle more pleasing than to mark Some Master of inimitable fence Strike Falsehood to the heart through every foil And feint of scoundrel skill? mark learning, sense, And trained acumen flash their sunlike rays Through all the vile, perversely winding ways Of vice; illuminate the burrowed maze And crannies Craft and Cunning know to shape, And stop their every earthhole of escape! Is not the Law a mighty mesh to snare The many-shifted meanness of mankind? Of cheated Innocence the Champion fair Against all wrongs by tyrant Wealth designed? Its task, what nobler since the world began, To sort and settle by right Reason's plan All deeds Man does or duties owes to Man? To stamp the drill and discipline of schools On the rude progeny of fertile Chance; Through Time's still widening wilderness to chase With the slow hounds of principles and rules (Though mostly distanced in the dubious race) The ever-doubling hares of Circumstance? Nay! may not even youth's impatience glance With pitying interest or perhaps with praise— At that mole-eyed devotion of old days Which with such mousing perseverance strove— Such creeping subtlety and crabbed love, To fit dead forms to living ages, lacking Responsive facts that made their sole defence; In search of reasons, dull inventions racking For aims that had to reason no pretence; And stretching Ingenuity to cracking, To reconcile absurdity to sense?— “Fine theories all!” thought Ranolf—“but that bowl Of Law—what golden bias guides its roll We know; how riches crush the right—how long Perverted learning bolsters up the wrong; And doubtless as distasteful it must be To dabble in diseased morality As physical corruption. Is it true Besides, that Wrong, like Right, to get its due, Let Justice fairly judge between the two, Must have its Advocate, whate'er he feel, To brawl and burst with simulated zeal?— 'Twere odious as, for those sly silent fees, To cant condolement with high-fed Disease, Paddle with Luxury's pampered pulse—and steal Through sham sick rooms with cat-like pace and purr Sleeking palled Fashion's pleasure-ruffled fur.” The petulant rash judgments of a boy Were these—all too impatient of the alloy Which human doings that have most of gold Too strictly analyzed must needs unfold?— They were enough to sway him, so are told. IV. Try then the Church. “What Church?” our youngster sighed: “Is there within the world's circumference wide A Church or any Temple—in this dearth Of Faith, with half her heavenly cables snapt, Hope's anchor scarcely left—has life or worth To make its intellectual votaries feel What in old days they felt; that martyr zeal, Forgetfulness of present self and rapt Possession of the Infinite on Earth That gave a grandeur to the Life it scorned? But who would brook a Church if unadorned With absolute love of Truth? unless it gave To Thought the utmost freedom it could crave; Followed where'er it led, true Reason's light; Avowed itself to Truth an utter slave, Truth ever and Truth only—come what might? And who that loved his own free soul could bear To work, a digger in the dark gold mine Of spiritual Truth, or bold researches try Where scientific Doubts with deadly shine Like Icebergs freeze, or Faith's bleached fragments lie Whitening the hot Saharas of Despair— Handcuffed and fettered with the leaden links Of dogmas stereotyped—creeds cut-and-dry And double-dry? heart-paralysed by dread Of all but what smooth smug ‘Society’ That feels by fashion and by custom thinks, Gives pass and permit to? Whose Soul so dead As dare put on a Soul-deliverer's power While forced or fain a Law Divine to trace Of Spiritual Storms in frothy-bubbling suds Raised in some legal Washtub where they scour And rinse hot-steaming ritualistic duds— Awestruck lest ultra-rubric rag and clout Lose cabalistic colour, gloss or grace, Ere it can rage its tiny tempest out?— Or who with strangely grovelling Quixotry Would think to quell the Evil all about With candlesticks and censers?—satisfy The crave for Infinite Good that cannot die, With trim and tinselled haberdashery? Who, in a fight so fierce in such an age, With lackered shields and silvered wooden swords Of ceremonious mummeries would engage? With pagan posture-tricks such warfare wage And pantomime, in place on Thespian boards— Stage-twirlings in the death-tug! Who could dote In imbecile expectance to assuage Sharp pangs of soul with prayers run up by rote In self-complacent trills with pompous throat? Would any heart remorse had desperate driven, Or milder sense of ‘Sin’ abased, on heaven In accents guided by the gamut call, And do-re-mi-sol-fa the God of All?” His youthful scorn would graver minds endorse?— Senses or Reason—any hook to raise The loach-like groundling Soul with—all must praise; The end—Soul-raising—no one contravenes; But why absurdly deify the means?— Then greater is a Priesthood's duty too Old Truth admitted to apply—enforce, Than to explore the Universe for new. But how much priestly truth is granted true? Science her freshets still must thunder down Of physical Truth, though drowsing Churches drown. Should not the eye be open?—hand be free To seize at once whate'er the eye may see Of nascent truth, and let the dying go? What, if your Priests, like Shepherds half asleep, Over the gold-brown gloss of dogmas keep Vain watch, while half their sheep a-hungered stray To succulent green pastures far away? For Forms of Faith, though beautiful they be, If e'er the Truth, their living spirit, flee, What are they like but cold and stony flowers, Those geysers boiling up through emerald bowers In far-off islands he was soon to see, Clothe with a sparry spume, that hardens white Around the perished plant concealed from sight, But still retains in delicate array Each form of tiny leaf and tender spray, Cold, crumbling, colourless—in lifeless pride— No growing green, no circling sap inside! But how should he presume by thought or deed To set up for a sower of Truth's seed?— Not his the credence that could teach a creed; The doubly-sure assurance that could feed Another's faith with fervour of its own. Faith has its temperate as its torrid zone; And widely different as joy from grief Is certain knowledge from sincere belief. V. Well, ere his choice was fixed—his father died, And left the youth with more of gold supplied Than for his moderate wishes would provide. So to the Sea, his passion all the time, He took. To rove from clime to clime At least would gratify his ruling taste: At least, he knew, upon the watery waste His buoyant spirits kept in play would be— His soul unfettered still, his fancy free. VI. And now behold this Ranolf once again Tossing, a student-sailor on the main; Sending from time to time, home-hearts to please, Some glimpses of the glories of the seas, And snatches of reflection—such as these: “How grandly—when throughout the silent day, Some ample Day, serene, divine, Beneath the glowing Line, Our helpless Ship had hung as in a trance In light-blue glassiness of calm that lay A wide expanse Encircled by soft depths of ether clear, Whose melting azure seemed to swim Surcharged and saturate with balmiest brilliancy— How grandly solemn was the Day's decline! Down as if wholly dropped from out the Sky The fallen Sun's great disc would lolling lie Upon the narrowed Ocean's very rim, Awfully near! A hush of deep suspense, grave, almost grim, Wrapt all the pure, blank, empty hemisphere: While straight across the gleaming crimson floor, From the unmoving Ship's black burnished side, There ran a golden pathway right into the coré Of all that throbbing splendour violet-dyed; Whither it seemed an easy task to follow The liquid ripples tremblingly o'erflowing Into the intense and blinding hollow Of palpitating purple, showing The way as through an open door Into some world of burning bliss, undreamt of heretofore! Whose heart would not have swelled, the while Deep adoration and delight came o'er him At that stupendous mystery, close before him! Not less, but more stupendous that he knew Perchance, whate'er the subtle surface-play Of Science had to teach of level ray Reflected or refracted; and could say Nay, almost count the millions to a mile, How far away That pure quintessence of dark fire, deep-lying In fathomless Flame-Oceans round him flying, His inconceivable circumference withdrew: Knew marvels of the fringe of flames that frisk In ruddy dance about his moon-masked face, Set on like petals round a sunflower's disc— Each glorious petal shooting into space A thousand times as far as Earth's vast globe is thick!— Could tell of that Fire-firmament immense Whose element-melting heat intense Makes iron into vapour boil— With alternating outrush and recoil Now towering high in polar crests of gold, Now spreading broad—a cestus round him rolled; While Chasm-Spots that worlds were pebbles thrown into, Gape wide beneath—close up—are many or few— As crests or girdle take their turn, With sway and resway rhythmic burn!— Stupendous ever! aye, though Science fancy-quick Foreguess full many a World Worn out, and, crushed to cinders, flying fleet; Or in cold black rotundity complete Into his cooling bosom headlong hurled, Just by collision to strike out fresh heat, And feed with flame, renew and trim, And keep awhile from falling dim That monstrous unimaginable wick! Say rather—for one system's billioned years keep bright Its awful, mystic, God-created Light!” VII. “Naraka—Niflheim—Tartarus—or Tophet! From what dead heart and poor unpicturing brain,— Too dull to see or realize Its own demoniac phantasies— Of Bonze, Skald, Brahmin, talapoin, or prophet— Goth, Syrian, Greek, or old Hindu, Of Aryan or Semitic strain,— Came singly or from all upgrew That rank arch blasphemy and dream insane Of torture-gulfs where Infinite Love All human guess or gauge above Preserves in fiery suffocation The myriads of its own creation? I care not—I; but when I came On deck in darkness yesternight, That very place appeared to be Laid bare before my startled sight! For far and wide in pale effulgence dire, One boundless ghastly welter of white fire, The Ocean rolled; a hoary Sea Of awful incandescence rolled and broke away In bursts of firespray—tongues of lambent flame That writhed and tossed in burning play, And with a baleful glare Put out the stars—quenched what mild radiance fell From the clear skies, as that unhallowed spell Of blighting Superstition can outblaze With its fierce coruscations of despair The genuine rays Of light from heaven that fall like dew, Divine illuminings serene and true. “And yet such thoughts did ill beseem This vision—so would any deem, And other lore and wiser learn, Who o'er the taffrail marked the excess And marvel of the loveliness Of those swift-whirling volumes of soft light Fast-flashing with gold star-drops sparkling bright In myriads through the alabaster glow— Those spangled gyres and wreaths of dazzling snow That still in wide expanding trail Went roaring off her stern So grandly as our Vessel through The surging phosphorescence flew; Streaming behind her, as the snowy plumes Of those rich birds the Aztecs old Reared at their royal Town of Gold, Stream when at dusk they slowly sail Streaking the depth of Amazonian glooms. Ah! surely no sound heart these glories seeing Would thence derive the notion of a Being Creating only to destroy; Or framing Phlegethons and fire-washed caves Swarming with frenzied Spirits thicker than these waves With millions of medusæ all alight with joy!” VIII. “St. Lawrence! yes, I well remember Thy Gulf—that morning in September.— Fast flew our Ship careering lightly Over the waters breaking brightly; Alongside close as if their aim Were but her vaunted speed to shame, Sleek porpoises like lightning went Cleaving the sunny element; Now where the black bows smote their way How would they revel in the roaring spray! Like victors in the contest now Dash swift athwart the flying prow; Or springing forward three abreast Shoot slippery o'er each foamy crest— Shoot upwards in an airy arc As three abreast they passed the bark:— Pied petrels coursed about the sea And skimmed the billows dexterously; Sank with each hollow, rose with every hill, So close, yet never touched them till They seized their prey with rapid bill:— Afar, the cloudy spurts of spray Told that the grampus sported there With his ferocious mates at play. Meanwhile the breeze that freshly blew From every breaking wavetop drew A plume of smoke that straightway from the sun The colours of the rainbow won, So that you saw wherever turning A thousand small volcanoes burning, Emitting vapours of each hue Of orange, purple, red and blue. The Sky meanwhile was all alive With snow-bright clouds that seemed to drive Swiftly, as though the Heavens in glee Were racing with the racing Sea: Each flitting sight and rushing sound Spread life and hope and joy around; Ship, birds and fishes, Sky and Ocean All restless with one glad emotion!— “But what a change! when suddenly we spy Apart from all that headlong revelry— Pencilled above the sky-line, like a Spectre drear, A silent Iceberg solemnly appear,— Pausing ghost-like our greeting to await.— The crystal Mountain, as we come anear And feel the airs that from it creep So chilling o'er the sunny Deep, Discloses—while it slowly shifts, Now blue, faint-glistening semilucent clifts, Now melancholy peaks, dead-white and desolate. “But comes it not, this Guest unbidden This wanderer from a home far-hidden, Dim herald of the mysteries of the Pole With tidings from that cheerless region fraught— Comes it not o'er us like the sudden Thought, The haunting phantom of a World apart, The blank and silent Apparition That, ever prompt to gain serene admission, Lurks on the crowded confines of the heart, The many-pictured purlieus of the Soul; Nay, sometimes thrusts its unexpected presence Upon our brightest-tinted hours of pleasaunce?— “That Polar realm is ransacked—known; Our outside World of Matter, still Lies pervious to determined will: And shall the World of Spirit never Its secrets yield to true endeavour?— Five thousand years have doubtless shown But little of that Spirit-zone: For Science is a Child as yet At hornbook rude and primer set: And Man is just emerging from the past Eternity of Darkness; from the vast Æons and ages of a measureless Night, Rubbing his eyes at the unwonted light: How should he read all things aright And say what can or cannot be—or utter Out of his heart the Universe, whose growth And whole existence yet is but the flutter Of an ephemeral water-moth? Take fifty thousand years—a span In the conceivable career of Man; Think you, with riper knowledge—skill profounder— No grand explorers, bolder, sounder, Will break into that Spirit-zone—reveal Not iron-bound realms of ruthless ice and snow Or narrow straits where freezing waters flow, No shooting lights, or shifting gleams; But prospects trustier than the dance and play Protean of those dumb magnetic storms— Auroras lovelier than our sanguine dreams Of fondest Inspiration—Forms Of Being more essentially divine Than all that in Thought's topmost triumphs shine? And prove how real the region whence our stray And shadowy intimations find their way; With what true signs and tokens rife Those glimmering dreams and fine forebodings steal Into the circle of our little day, Into the glad familiar Sea of Life?’ Canto the Seventh. The Shipwreck. 1, 2. Ranolf shipwrecked. 3. Rescued by the island's inhabitants. 4. The ‘Pure Benevolence.’ 5. He resolves to see more of the country and people. I. How like white steam-spurts swiftly disappearing When railway trains are rapidly careering, Fumes, frets and melts away this Life of Man! Bowling before the fresh fair breezes ran Our Ranolf's stately Ship; and now was nearing A range of rugged hills whose olive-green, Sleeked over faintly with a sunny sheen, Upon the starboard bow was seen. Obliquely towards one shadow she was steering That, darklier-painted, showed a harbour's mouth, Because between her and that goal There stretched a hidden dangerous shoal. For towering topmasts of the Kauri pine The Ship had voyaged to the verdant Isles, The Sea-girt El Dorado of the South Whose mountains famous since for many a mine Of marvellous wealth, and reefs of riches, stand The golden baits from bygone ages planned To draw the swarms that, sweltering in distress Cannot be won by nature's simpler wiles, From climes where Life in very overstrife To live chokes out redundant rival Life, To this remote sweet wilderness, This Life-deserted, Life-desiring land. In deep blue sky the sun is bright; The Port some few miles off in sight; The pleasant Sea's subsiding swell Of gales for days gone by may tell, But on the bar no breaker white, Only as yet a heavier roll Denotes where lurks that dangerous shoal. Alert with lead, and chart, and glass, The Pilot seeks the well-known pass; All his familiar marks in view Together brought, distinct and true. Erelong the tide's decreasing stream Chafes at the nearer bank beneath; The Sea's dark face begins to gleam (Like tiger roused that shows his teeth) With many a white foam-streak and seam: Still should the passage, though more rough, Have depth of water, width, enough.— But why, though fair the wind and filled The sails, though masts and cordage strain, Why hangs, as by enchantment stilled, The Ship unmoving?—All in vain The helm is forced hard down; 'tis plain The shoal has shifted, and the Ship Has touched, but o'er its tail, may slip: She strains—she moves—a moment's bound She makes ahead—then strikes again With greater force the harder ground. She broaches to; her broadside black Full in the breakers' headlong track; They leap like tigers on their prey; She rolls as on they come amain, Rolls heavily as in writhing pain. The precious time flies fast away— The launch is swiftly manned and sent Over the lee, with wild intent To anchor grapplings where the tide Runs smoother, and the Ship might ride Secure beyond the raging bar, Could they but haul her off so far. The boat against her bows is smashed: Beneath the savage surges dashed, Sucked under by the refluent wave, They vanish—all those seamen brave. On—on—the breakers press—no check— No pause—fly hissing o'er the wreck, And scour along the dangerous deck. The bulwarks on the seaward side, Boats—rudder—sternpost iron-tied With deep-driven bolts (how vain a stay!) The weight of waters tears away. Alas! and nothing can be done— No downward-hoisted flag—no gun Be got at to give greater stress To that unheard demand for aid By the lost Ship's whole aspect made— Herself, in piteous helplessness, One huge sad signal of distress. Still on—and on—the tide's return Redoubling now their rage and bulk, In one fierce sweep from stem to stern The thundering sheets of breakers roar, High as the tops in spray-clouds soar, And down in crashing cataracts pour Over the rolling, tortured hulk. Death glares in every horrid shape— No help—no mercy—no escape! For falling spars dash out the brains Of some—and flying guns adrift Or splinters crush them—slaughter swift Whereof no slightest trace remains; The furious foam no bloodshed stains: Up to the yards and tops they go— No hope—no chance of life below! Then as each ponderous groaning mast Rocks loosened from its hold at last, The shrouds and stays, now hanging slack, Now jerking, bounding, tensely back, Fling off the helpless victims fast, Like refuse on the yeast of death That bellows, raves and boils beneath. One hapless wretch around his waist A knotted rope has loosely braced; When from the stay to which he clings, The jerking mast the doomed one flings, It slips—and by the neck he swings: Death grins and glares in hideous shape— No hope—no pity—no escape!— Still on and on—all day the same, Through all that brilliant summer day Beneath a sky so blithe and blue The wild white whirl of waters flew; In stunning volleys overswept And beat the black Ship's yielding frame, And all around roared, tossed, and leapt— Mad-wreathing swathes of snow! affray More dire than most disastrous rout Of some conceivable array Of thronged white elephants—as they Their phalanx broke in warfare waged In Siam or the Punjaub—raged And writhed their great white trunks about, With screams that shrill as trumpets rung, And drove destruction everywhere In maddened terror at the shout Of turbaned hosts and torches' flare Full in their monstrous faces flung;— Wide horror! but to this, no less, This furious lashing wilderness, Innocuous-seeming—transient—tame! Still on—still on—like fiends of Hell Whiter than Angels—frantic—fell, Through all that summer day the same The merciless murderous breakers came! And to the mizzen-top that swayed With every breach those breakers made, Unaided, impotent to aid— The mates and Master clung all day. There—while the Sun onlooking gay Triumphant trod his bright highway; There, till his cloudless rich decline,— Faint in the blinding deafening drench Of salt waves roaring down the whine And creaking groans each grinding wrench Took from the tortured timbers—there All day—all day—in their despair, The gently brave—the roughly good, Collected, calm and silent stood. That hideous doom they firmly face; To no unmanly moans give way, No frantic gestures; none disgrace With wild bravado, vain display, Their end, but like true men await The dread extremity of Fate. Alas! and yet no tongue can tell What thoughts of life and loved ones swell With anguish irrepressible, The hearts these horrors fail to quell. The Master urges them to prayer, ‘No hope on Earth—be Heaven your care!’— And is it mockery—O but mark Those masts and crowding figures, dark Against the flush of love and rest Suffusing all the gorgeous West In tearful golden glory drest! Such soft majestic tenderness, As of a Power that longs to bless With ardours of divinest breath All but one raging spot of Death:— For all the wide expanse beside Is blushing, beauteous like a Bride; And a fierce wedding-day indeed It seems, of Life and Death—with none to heed. And now the foam spurts up between The starting deck-planks; downward bowed The mighty masts terrific lean; Then each with its despairing crowd Of life, with one tremendous roar Falls like a tower—and all is o'er. II. One of the worn despairing ring who round Their chief upon the mizzen-top had found A dizzy shelter in the pelting spray, Had Ranolf borne that dreadful day; Down with the headlong mast was thrown; And as his consciousness flashed back again (A moment in the act of falling gone) He found himself almost alone With desperate clutch still clinging to the top Beneath its lee that fenced the lashing rain Of breakers off—else all had been in vain. 'Mid tangled rigging, to the vessel's side With violent efforts he contrived to glide; Then, by the chains protected, in the shade Of the green flying roof the wild waves made, In that dark hollow's gloom a hideous space, Steadying his thoughts and strength he clung, While in his ears the roaring ceaseless race, The driving avalanche that knew no stop, With stunning dread reverberation rung. Beneath him frequent timbers swung In fragments to and fro; so, quick as thought, He seized a lucky chance to drop Into the weltering foam, and caught A floating piece of plank, and kept Despairing yet determined hold, While it and he like lightning swept To where the waves less wildly rolled: A larger fragment next he gained; Then, with what failing strength remained, Straight towards that dear-bought harbour strained. III. Scarce half a mile the favouring tide Had forged his drifting plank ahead, When in the gathering gloom he spied A big canoe with bulwarks red; And heard the beat of paddles plied With strong recurrence—right good will. Half dead with cramp, fatigue, and chill, He called; the paddles all were still. He called again; a cheery strain Gave answer as the rowers sung; And forth the bounding vessel sprung And shot his wayward plank beside With swirling swiftness as a coot Or wild duck will alighting shoot— Ere it can stay its headlong way— Along the ruffled water. Then An eager crowd of deep-voiced men, Dark-visaged, wild—in unknown tongue, Their hoarse congratulations cried, As safe on board the backed canoe With rapid talk and much ado, That kindly crew the Stranger drew. With fiercer chaunt they pulled ashore; There from his clothes the water wrung, Lit fires, brought food, and on the floor His bed of fresh-pulled ferns o'erlaid With clean elastic mattings made; Tried all that care or kindness can Of genial Earth or generous Man— Though one half desert, one half savage— To smooth and smile away the pangs Of grief and bodily pain and dread Of horrible Ocean's wreck and ravage, Whose shadow like a nightmare hangs O'er one who lives, of many dead, Just rescued from her ruthless fangs. IV. So ended that death-stricken day.— But how felt Ranolf as he lay Rescued and weary—and could scarcely deem 'Twas real, what seemed a wild tremendous dream, That all his comrades bold had passed away? Bursting with thanks, O doubt not, to the Power Whose laws had let him live through such an hour: And yet—to think of all that life so marred And mangled, swept away like worthless chaff While merciless mocking Nature did but laugh!— “This pure Benevolence hits somewhat hard It must be owned,” thought he, “or rather say Inexorable laws must have their way. Were any breach of law allowed, who knows What infinite disasters would ensue! Such certainty is safest, we suppose, For creatures such as Men are. Trite and true! Yet such a hell of havoc as we saw To-day makes one half dubious of such law; Results so dire, alas! who would not call Demoniac still—if what we see were all!” V. When from the beach with swollen corpses strewn Like seaweed, 'mid the waste of wreck upthrown His sea-chest had been brought, and honestly Returned him—as he much desired More of this people and their land to see— (Reports all made—leave asked and given first) To the far neighbouring continent he sent, To pay for food and service as required, For woven stuffs and many an implement And trinket these barbarians most admired. Their language then he set himself to learn With zeal, until the vessel's slow return; And when in that, and their strange customs versed, With followers often changed and cheaply paid From place to place and tribe to tribe he strayed: And so his way, amused and loitering, made Into the interior far—to slake the thirst Adventurous no disasters had allayed. BOOK THE SECOND. THE SOUTH-SEA VILLAGERS. Canto the First. The Rescue. 1. Ranolf, after a boar-hunt, his dog killed, fancies an after life for lower animals. 2. A new Italy. 3. His joyous and imaginative temperament. 4. A shriek. 5. Amohia. 6. A rescue. 7. Her story. 8. She returns to the Isle in the Lake. 9. His thoughts of her. I. “Glorious! this life of lake And hill-top! toil and tug through tangled brake, Dense fern, and smothering broom; And then such rests as now I take In sunflecked soft cathedral-gloom Of forests immemorial! Noble sport Boar-hunting! yet that furious charge, the last Of the dead monster there had cut it short For me, and once for all, belike, Had not his headlong force impaled The savage on my tough wood-pike That, propped with planted knee and foot, Its butt against a rata-root, From chest to chine right through him passed And nought his inch-thick hide availed, Or ring-like tusks upthrusting through The notches of his foaming lips, By constant whetting planed away To chisel-sharpness at their tips: It weakened him—the knife-dig, too, He caught when first commenced the fray; When, as in haste I sprang astride The narrowed gully—just a ditch With flowering koromiko rich— Between my feet the villain drove, And fierce, with short indignant sniffs, And grunts like muttering thunder, strove To gain his haunts beyond the cliffs, And foil the foes he fled from, yet defied. “But Nim, my glorious bull-dog! Nim, My mighty hunter of the boar, Who never recked of life or limb That old antagonist before! That rip has finished his career— His last boar-fight is fought; no more He'll come to greet me as of yore, Wriggling his lithe spine till his tail Whipped his black muzzle in the excess Of cringing canine happiness; No more his genuine love express With such dumb signs and tokens clear, Mock bites and mouthings of the hand, Easy as words to understand. Strange, a mere dog should be so dear! But he is dead, and—done with, must we say? Poor victim of this universal demon-play Of Life—my fate to-morrow, his to-day, Which I, for sport, have sealed—as God (or no God, then Say you?) that of his myriad worlds and men? And ‘pluck’ like his, that nought could quail; Good temper—honest humble love and truth— These must not live again, forsooth! No future for the Dog—but why? Duty, our highest inborn feeling, who Has stronger than this guardian true To death? or can we in our own rejoice, As sprung from self-determined choice? That Self with so much bias made— Our Will by strongest motive swayed? Scarce higher than his, our claims, I fear, To merit of our own appear. Then compound, too, not simple, he, A work complete no more than we, (If stuff for hope therein may be), Has not his nature, like our own, Instincts at war, the lower with the high? With trusts to be fulfilled, obedience shown— The longing for the ramble, game forbidden, Or bone, like miser's treasure, hidden? And if, instead of eyes that often so With solemn melancholy glow, He had but tongue to speak with, who can show He might not tell of hopes, and dim Perceptions, yearnings, that no longer dumb, He, too, may rise to human, and become Erect some day, a ruler and a lord, And, like his master, loved, adored, A visible God and Providence to him— Though swayed, no doubt, full oft, by rage, caprice and whim. As good a faith or fancy 'twere To think all conscious creatures—foul or fair, One universal endless progress share; In the procession headed by mankind, Only a march or two behind; Each rank of God's grand army onward bent To higher states and stages—who knows where?— Of free and fortunate development!” II. So mused young Ranolf as he lay at ease, Profaning (must we needs confess?) With chestnut-glossed pet meerschaum the pure breeze; Enjoying in delicious cool no less The mighty shade of old majestic trees, Whose tops the skies beneath our feet immerse, Far in the land, greenwaving, grand, Upon our seeming world-medallion's rich reverse: The ruder Italy laid bare By that keen Searcher of the Seas Whose tempest-battling, never-baffled keel, Left half our planet little to reveal; But restless roaming everywhere Zigzagged the vast Pacific as he prest With godlike patience his benignant quest; True hero-god, who realized the notion Its races feign of mythic Maui still, And plucked up with a giant might of will A hundred Islands from Oblivion's ocean! Sea-king and sage—staunch huntsman of pure Fame, Beating the waste of waters for his game, Untrodden shores or tribes without a name; That nothing in an island's shape, Mist-muffled peak or faint cloud-cape Might his determined thoughtful glance escape; No virgin lands be left unknown, Where future Englands might be sown, And nations noble as his own! III. Loose-clad in careless sailor-guise, But richly robed in that imperial dress Of symmetry and suppleness And sinewy strength that Nature's love supplies, When at youth's prime, her work, superbly planned, Takes the last touches from her Artist-hand, Was our new roamer of the forest near Calm Rotorúa's ferny strand. To him was not denied, 'twas clear, That best of boons at her command— A joyous spirit sparkling like the day, Set in well-tempered, finely-fashioned clay. His fair complexion, slightly tanned By central suns' and oceans' glare; His eyes' gray gleams and amber hair, Were such as brighten best where gloom and cold And sombre clouds harsh northern skies enfold: But curling locks and lip, and glance Keen for all beauty everywhere; The straight harmonious features—though perchance Squarer than pure proportion asked, in cheek And brow, more thought and firmness to bespeak— Of southern fervour and quick feeling told. His love of the mysterious—vast—whate'er Of solemn and sublime could bear The soul aloft on wings of thrilling awe; The restless daring that his reason led To question all he heard and read; The senses potent to divine the springs Of pleasure in a thousand things, Seemed from each clime some elements to draw Like Gothic metal run in Grecian mould. In active body—vigorous mind, Such seeming contrasts he combined; Still, in his face whate'er expressions shone, And to what moods soever he was prone,— 'Twas hardy gladness by strong will controlled— A summer torrent bounding on incessant Through rampart layers of glittering stone, Seemed the habitual and abiding one. Blithe Hope upon his forehead bold Sate like a sunbeam on a gilt mosque-crescent; And oft, in reverie, if he gazed apart, His eye would kindle as in admiration Of some past scene to fancy present, Or glory glowing in the future distance; As if one breaking morn of gold Were round Life's whole horizon rolled As if his pulse beat music, and his heart Clashed cymbal-bursts of exultation In the mere rapture of existence! IV. A shriek within the covert near, A second, third, assailed his ear; Straight for the sound at once he dashed; Through tangled boughs and brushwood crashed, And lopped and slashed the tangles black Of looped and shining supplejack, Till on a startling scene he came, That filled his soul with rage and shame. Her mantle flung upon the ground, Her graceful arms behind her bound, With shoulders bare, dishevelled hair, There stood a Maiden of the land, More stately fair than could elsewhere Through all its ample range be found. Two of his comrades, hired amid The tribes whose chieftains held command O'er all the vales those mountains hid— Those western mountains forest-crowned— Wild striplings, who, uncurbed from birth, Deemed foulest wrong but food for mirth So that their listless life it stirred, Were basely busy on each hand, With flax-blades binding to a tree The Maid who strove her limbs to free. They knew her—for they oft had heard Of that surpassing form and face; They knew the hate, concealed or shown, Between her people and their own; The feuds, when open war would cease, That smouldered in precarious peace; They knew the track by which the chase Had lured them to that lonely place, Was so unused, so tangled, rough, They doubtless would have time enough, And might without pursuit retrace Their steps through mountain-woods, so dense, No wrong would be suspected thence, No outrage dreamt of. So they thought— If such a thoughtless impulse wild Of mischief can a thought be styled— They fancied, when the Maid they caught At that secluded spot, alone With one slave-girl (who shrieking fled, While after her a third accomplice sped Lest she the alarm too soon should spread) It was a chance to win a name, Through many a tribe some facile fame— Let but their foreign friend agree, If such a captive to their chief they led, At his behest, dispose, to be. V. Not more incensed—scarce lovelier in her wrath— The silver-bow'd snow-Goddess seen By rapt Actæon at her awful bath; Not prouder looked—scarce fiercer in her pride, The yellow-haired Icenian Queen, Stung by the tortures she defied; Than did that flaxen-kilted Maid— A warmer Dian—at her russet rise Dun-shining through autumnal mist; A young Boadicea sunnier skies Had into browner beauty kissed. So flashed her eyes with scorn and ire, They seemed, as deep in purple shade The slanting sunbeams left the wood And gloomy yew whereby she stood, Two glowing gems of hazel fire. And though a single sparkling tear— Upon each lower eyelid checked, Whose thick silk fringe, a coalblack streak, So darkly decked her flushing cheek In mellow contrast to its clear Rich almond brown—alone confest Some softer feelings lurked among The passions that her bosom wrung; Yet indignation's withering flame So towered and triumphed o'er the rest, Did so enkindle and inform Her heaving breast, her writhing frame, Just then, you would almost have deemed, Her very tresses as they streamed, With lightnings from that inner storm And not with flecks of sunset, gleamed. “Slaves!” she was saying: “this to me! Me, Amohia! Know you not The daughter of the ‘Sounding Sea?’ Is Tangi-möana forgot? When he shall this vile outrage know, Your homes shall blaze, your hearts'-blood flow; A life for every hair shall pay Of her you've dared insult this day!” VI. Swift to her aid our Wanderer sprung, Aside those ruffians roughly flung; Cut, tore away, the bonds that laced Those tender arms, that slender waist; Reproached, rebuked with sarcasm strong The culprits for their coward wrong; The Maid with soothing words addrest— Regret and deep disgust expressed At what disturbed her—so distrest; By every gesture, look, declared How much her grief and pain he shared; Urged all that might with most effect Her anger stay, her grief allay, And smooth her ruffled self-respect. And if, while thus the Maid he freed With eager haste, and soon replaced Her mantle, tagged with sable cords Of silky flax in simple taste, He could not choose but interfuse Some looks amid his cheering words, Keen admiration's natural meed To one with so much beauty graced; Think you, this stranger's form and mien Could fail to make their influence felt; Unconscious though she might have been Of their magnetic power to melt, Pierce, permeate her spirit's gloom, And all her brightening breast illume, Till docile, ductile, it became To his persuasive voice's sway— Mild breathings of discretion, reason's claim; As on a summer day The silent sunbeams sink into and fill A snowy cloud, and make it lighter still For gentlest breeze to bear away? And pleased was he, surprised to mark How swiftly vanished every trace Of passion so tempestuous, dark; Its shadow floating off a face Where, sooth to say, at any time It seemed as alien, out of place, As some great prey-bird's, haply seen, Not mid the awful regions where he breeds, Sky-sweeping mountains, towering peaks sublime, But in a land with daisied lawns and meads And rippling seas of poppied corn serene. VII. And all her story soon was told; How she had left Mokoia's isle That central in the lake alone Rose high—a bristling mountain-hold With fort and fosse—a dark green boss On that bright shield of azure-stone; Had left the isle, the time to while With one companion in her light canoe; While in a larger came a fisher-crew She wiselier should have kept in view. But they two of the sport had soon Grown weary in the glaring noon; So landed, from the sun's attacks Their splendour-puckered eyebrows to relax In the refreshing grateful shade A clump of trees not distant made. Thence to a spot amid the level hills Of Rangikáhu, where a hotspring fills, Near a deserted settlement, A square stone-tank ('twas Miroa's whim), they went To boil some sweet roots which they found As they expected in a patch Of old abandoned garden-ground. That done, they strolled the forest through, And strolled to little purpose too; Had tried a parrot for a pet to catch In vain; had seen, by marshy glade Or woodside brake, look where they might, No tangle of convolvulus to twine Into rich coronals of cups aglow With deep rose-purple or delicate white Pink-flushed as sunset-tinted snow; No clematis, so lovely in decline, Whose star-flowers when they cease to shine Fade into feathery wreaths silk-bright And silvery-curled, as beauteous. And they knew The early season could not yet Have ripened the alectryon's beads of jet, Each on its scarlet strawberry set, Whence sweet cosmetic oils they press Their glittering blue-black hair to dress Or give the skin its velvet suppleness. So they had loitered objectless, And chaunting songs or chatting strayed Till by his rude associates met. VIII. Her simple story told, the Maid Asked in her turn the Wanderer's name; Tried to pronounce it too; but still With pretty looks of mock distress And scorn at her own want of skill, And tempting twisting lips no stain Of tattoo had turned azure—found “Ranolf” too strange and harsh a sound For her harmonious speech to frame; So after various efforts vain “Ranóro” it at last became, The nearest imitation plain Her liquid accents could attain. Thus, when at length they reached the shore, Had found and freed and comforted The damsel who at first had fled (Poor little Miroa, weeping sore), And launched the small canoe once more, 'Twas with a farewell kind and gay She bade the stranger “Go his way;” 'Twas with her radiant ready smile She started for the mountain-isle, Which then, one mass of greenish gold, Shone out in sharp relief and bold Against the further hills that lay In solemn violet-gloom—grim, dark and cold. IX. So towards his tent his steps he bent; Nor marvel if as home he went His thoughts to her would still recur:— “—But Amohia! what a glorious creature In every gesture, every feature! Such melting brilliant eyes! I swear They cast a shadow from whate'er They rest upon! I do believe they throw Such shifting circlets of soft light On what she looks at, as a sunbeam weaves On the green darkness of the noonday woods Through chinks in the transparent leaves! And then her hair! to see it but unbound! Such black abundant floods Of tresses making midnight all around For those twin stars to shine through! while between In glimpses the fair neck was seen Just as at night upon those white And windheaped hummocks of glimmering sand— Thickflowing sand—so finely sifted By the gales whereby 'twas drifted— Soft patches of pale moonlight stand Beside their sable shadows. Then her teeth! All things that most of whiteness boast How dull and dim beside them! The far wreath Of snow upon those peaks eternal— The sea-foam creaming round the coast— The wave-bleached shell upon it tost— No, none of these—perhaps the kernel Of a young cocoanut when newly broken Would best their blue-white purity betoken. But these are graces to be left unspoken Beside the soul—the spirit's charm That from some well of witchery internal Comes dancing up—confiding—warm, All diamond dew of pure delight upspringing— Such sparkling spray of kindliness outflinging!— How frank and noble is her face! And what a sunny pride and sweetness lies In those open brilliant eyes! Her voice chimes like a merry bird's; How winning are her cheerful words!— With what a blithe and stately grace She drew her glistening flaxen mat, With chequered border decked, Into the hollows of her wavy form, And stepped away erect!— A maiden of a million that!—” Strange power of beauty! in a moment's space It photographs itself upon the brain, And though with limnings soft as light, imprints— Burns in, such deep encaustic tints, The finest line, the tenderest stain, No future impress can displace, No wear and tear of Time efface! Canto the Second. The ‘Sounding Sea.’ 1. A great Maori Chieftain; what he prides himself on. 2. Worst native vices now extinct. 3. Tangi persists in his native faith. 4. A born Leader. 5. A thunderstorm. Amo out on the Lake. Tangi exorcises the God of Storms. 6. Her return with a messenger. I. A fine old sturdy stalwart stubborn Chief Was Tangi-Möana, the ‘Sounding Sea’: Both brave and wise in his degree. In Council calm, no windy waterspout, He loved with some bold figure brief, In words—or blunt symbolic act without— To clench and quench discussion quietly. But there so careless of distinction, he Was a conspicuous, restless, fiery guiding-Star And rocklike rallying-point in war. His many merits how shall we repeat? In all that most adorns a Chief complete. Highborn—of ancient perfect pedigree, The carved and saw-notched stick, his family-tree And roll heraldic, where each tooth expressed A male progenitor, concisely showed How still through these his lineage proud had flowed. For not a single gap confessed The rank did ever in a female vest, Since from that blissful Isle divine Far o'er the azure hyaline— That sunlit vision seen sublime Faint glimmering through thick mists of Time, The cradle of his race, in legends yet Embalmed, a fond ideal for regret;— Since from Hawaiki, tempest-driven, Or roaming restless for a wider home, Five hundred years ago had come The mighty Founder of his line, Commanding (one of those primeval Seven) His old hereditary grand Canoe. To all the unkempt Aristocrats around Who could a better model be Of all befitting their degree? For costlier mantles, richer in design, No chief more carelessly possessed: None with a choicer feather-crest Would, when occasion needed it, be crowned; Had those rare plumes in heir-loom chest preserved More richly carved, more elegantly curved; There, with green nephrite pendants safely hid, Though loose its oval-shaped, oil-darkened lid— His sole tapu a far securer guard Than lock and key of craftiest notch and ward. And none gave ampler feasts—displayed War-clubs of more transparent jade: And finer closer spirals of dark blue Were never seen than in his cheek's tattoo; Fine as if engine-turned those curves declared No cost to fee the Artist had been spared; That many a basket of good maize had made That craftsman careful how he tapped his blade, And many a greenstone trinket had been given To get his chisel-flint so deftly driven. II. Now at the time whereof we tell, The white man's creed—the potent spell Of civilised communion—had begun Their work about the borders of the land. Before that higher light, and influence bland, As night recedes long ere you see the sun, The most revolting vices of the race, (Among ev'n those who never would embrace The new belief)—child-murder and the feast That sinks the cannibal below the beast His better there,—the ghoullike foul disgrace, Had slunk away abashed and wholly ceased. As, when you turn upon a sea-creek's shore, Some limpet-crusted boulder o'er, The reptile life that swarmed and skulked beneath So close that nothing there had seemed to breathe— Sea-centipedes and purple crabs and worms Threadlike blood-red—and limbless fleshy forms, Swiftly or slowly—all before the light, Shrink—wriggle—scuttle sidelong out of sight; So had those viler vices taken flight. III. And Tangi and his tribe thus much had gained, Those vices lost, but all their gods retained. A love of change was never fault of his, And least he fancied such a change as this. Once when a zealous teacher from the North The terrors of his creed had thundered forth— Unfolded with keen zest and kind desire To save his hearers from so sad a fate, His pleasant faith in everlasting fire, And painted all the pangs the damned await— While horror blanched the cheeks of half the crowd, Old Tangi roared with laughter long and loud: That Hell of theirs, he said, might be a place Wholesome and fitting for the white man's race, No Maori was half bad enough to be Doomed to so horrible a destiny: Had a good Spirit destined for such woe His children after death, he long ago Had sent some trusty friend to let them know; But he for his part would have nought to do With any Atua, whether false or true, Who could delight his direst foe to see The victim of such monstrous cruelty. And when he learnt what adverse sects prevailed And how each other's doctrines they assailed, He held his hand out, with the fingers spread— “So many ways to heaven you teach,” he said; “When you have fixed the right one and none doubt it, 'Twill then be time for me to think about it.” Sometimes indeed when young hardheaded minions From seaside tribes would urge these new opinions, Our Chief, for argument was not his forte, With calm remonstrance tried to cut them short: What all their ancestors and his believed Why could not they? that which was good enough For them, might well content, as he conceived, Such youngsters;—husky grew his voice and gruff: “What give up all our good old ways—the charms And ceremonies practised all our lives To make our Men all warriors, brave in arms, Our Women skilful, chaste, industrious wives;— Give up our wars—war-dances—tauas—taboo, Whence all our wealth, and power, and fame accrue, For these new notions! were they all to cease For this effeminate creed of love and peace!”— But when the good old Chief found all he felt So strongly had no power to move or melt His tough opponents, he the point pursued No further—but with self-complaisance stout Closed with that comfort—wherein oft no doubt Much abler controversialists conclude— “'Twas self-sufficiency—'twas downright mere Conceit that would not see a case so clear— 'Twas rage for talk, or love of contradiction, That would not be convinced”—by his conviction! And so a hearty heathen he remained, And those new whimsies quietly disdained; He fed his Gods and fee'd his priests so well, What was to him the white Man's heaven or hell? A Priest himself and half a God or quite, Did not the elements confess his might? At least all said so—and if failure wrought Misgiving, still desire constrained his thought; The failure proved the counteracting spite Of rival Gods into collision brought,— Against his own pretensions argued nought. Nor wonder this should be; when low and base Man's notions of a God, and vain and high Those of himself, as with a barbarous race And minds uncultured ever is the case, Men may believe their own divinity: Manhood and Godhood come so near together They may be made to mingle and agree Without much stretch of Faith's or Fancy's tether. And thus our Chieftain felt; if he excelled In attributes for which his Gods were held Divine—might he not be their equal too? Could he not at his pleasure save or slay, A Lord of life and death as well as they? And for those elements—'twas but mistaking The still unknown and so obscure relations Between the Spirit mystical outbreaking Through all the manifold manifestations Of Nature, and the surer Spirit illuming His own as mystic Being, and mastery thence, In pride of his superior excellence, Over that other phase of Spirit assuming. IV. Such was this Tangi—such ‘The Sounding Sea’; Of form almost gigantic he— Bull-necked, square-jawed, bold-eyed, firm-lipped, high-browed, His looks proclaimed his character aloud. And when he stood forth in full height and pride In flowing vest of silky flax, undyed, But crimson-spotted with round knobs of wool, Black points of cord, alternate, hanging free; And o'er it, down to the brown ankles bare A mantle of white wild-dog fur well-dressed, Its skirt's broad rim tan-hued; his snowy hair Crowned with a jet-black arching crest Of hoopoe-feathers stuck upright, Their tips a crescent of pure white; And in his hand, to order with or smite, The greenstone baton broad of war or rule, Green, smooth and oval as a cactus leaf— Did he not look, aye, every inch a Chief? Did not each glance and gesture stamp him then, Self-heralded a God-made King of Men? V. A thunderstorm was sweeping o'er the Lake, The hills had whitened off in sudden mist That soon grew leaden-livid; flake on flake The fine spray smoked along the watery floor— Till plumb-down rushed the rain's impetuous pour; A thousand claps of thunder seemed to break Confusedly all at once—with clattering roar Tumbled about the air or groaning rolled, As if some race Titanic storming Heaven From ponderous unimaginable wains On rocky grating causeways headlong driven, Shot crashing mountains on the skyey plains; Or if the tumult for a moment stopped You heard the torrent rain how loud it hissed, As if a hecatomb of bulls at least Were broiling for some sacrificial feast; And all about the liquid lightnings dropped In points like grapestones shaped, of molten gold. But Tangi, while the tempest raged, was told That where his daughter might be no one knew— They feared, upon the Lake in her canoe. Straightway the stoutest of his clansmen staunch He sent in search of her their boats to launch; Then set himself to charm away the Storm; And it was rare to see the grand old Chief Now in the haughtiness of fancied power To cope with Nature in her fiercest hour, Quick pouring forth wild-ringing chaunt on chaunt To bid Tawhiri—God of Storms—Avaunt! Now in a rival storm of rage and grief Threatening—reproaching—all his stalwart form Dilating with defiance: outstretched arms And head thrown back and milk-white fleece of hair, And bloodshot eyes and dark-blue visage bare Lit up by fits in the blue lightning's glare!— So plies he his monotonous rude charms— So on the Storm his vehement passion vents, Hoarsely upbraiding the hoarse elements. VI. But soon the light Canoe they saw Come bounding o'er the breaking wave; There sate, with looks of mingled awe And wild delight, the Maiden brave! With rapid change from side to side A native youth the paddle plied— A stranger, and his hearty will Seemed matched with equal strength and skill. Attentive to his least command The Maiden grasped with one firm hand The sheet that held the shortened sail That strained and tugged beneath the gale, And with the other strove to bale Fast as she could the water, still Threatening the little bark to fill. Begemmed with spray her dark hair streamed; Her beauteous cheek no paler seemed Though rain and spray-drops o'er it teemed, And all around the lightnings gleamed: For neither lightning, rain nor spray Could turn her from her task away. Still stood the sail and bending mast, And they the beach were nearing fast. Then through the waters' boiling strife The clansmen rushed at risk of life; A struggling, swimming, diving crowd, They seized with acclamations loud The gunwale of the light canoe; On either side, a dancing row Of rough black heads now rising through Now sunk beneath the foamy snow, With great triumphant shouts they bore Canoe and Maiden to the shore. Canto the Third. The Magician. 1. Death of Amo's affianced husband. 2. Dirge for a Chief dishonoured by a peaceful death. 3. Amo released from the Tapu (taboo). 4. The Tapu's power and use. 5. Kangapo. 6. Disgusted that the Chief's death will falsify his predictions. 7. Tries new auguries. 8. Gets answers from spirits—how. I. Then Amohia's comrade told how he To Rotorua's Chief of high degree From Tapu-ae by Taupo's Lake, his home, A messenger of great sad news was come. How he by chance upon the other side Had in her bark the Maid espied, And she had offered him a cast across. And then he told the lamentable loss Of great Te Rehu—Taupo's Chief, to whom That Maiden, as they knew so well, From the first promise of her matchless bloom Had been betrothed and ‘tapu’—It befel In this wise. Sometime since, continuous rain Softening a mountain, it had slipped amain Down and across a deep ravine and dammed A running stream, and all its waters jammed Between the hills, till thus repressed and choked Into the porous mound they slowly soaked; And one fine night when all was still and dim, The saturate mighty mass had burst away, And rushing down the vale, while fast asleep Te Rehu and his nearest kindred lay Least dreaming such a doom, had swallowed him And them and their whole village in a deep And stifling yellow mass of fluent clay, So overwhelming, sudden, viscous, they Could neither float, nor rise in it nor swim. II. Astonished, shocked at such a tale, At such a death for so renowned a man, Low murmurs through the crowding hearers ran: And when the storm had to the hills retreated, Though still it rumbled, lumbering heavily In the back chambers of the sky, With downcast looks in treble circle seated, And grief, if false yet truly counterfeited, The summoned clansmen sung their song of wail. One, standing in the midst the slow sad chaunt began:— “Death, degrading, mournful, gloomy! Death unfit for song or story, Death for a dog—a cur—a slave— Not for the brave!—” And all took up the chorus harsh and strong, In perfect time discharging groan on groan, While rolled a distant thunderpeal along In kindred and scarce deeper tone: “Death, O Death, how hateful, gloomy! Death for a dog—a slave—a slave! Then rose the single voice in prouder strain, Just as the lightning flashed again: “Had you died the death of glory On the field of battle gory, Died the death a chief would choose, Not this death so sad and gloomy,— Then with tuft and tassel plumy, Down of gannet—sea-king's feather, Gaily-waving, snowy-flecking, Every deep-red gunwale decking,— Then a hundred brave canoes With elated Warriors freighted, Like one man their war-chaunt chiming, Fierce deep cries the paddles timing, While the paddles' serried rows Like broad bird's-wings spread and close, Through the whitening Waves like lightning Had been darting all together, Forward through the foam together, All in quest of vengeful slaughter Tearing through the tortured water!” And from the dusky figures seated round, With savage satisfaction in the sound— A stern deep pride with sadness shadowed o'er, Like volleys fired above a soldier's grave, Rang out the chorussed thundering groans once more: “Ha! a hundred brave canoes— Crowding, crashing, Darting, plashing, Darting, dashing through the wave! Forward—forward all together, All in quest of foemen's slaughter, They had cleft the foamy water Seeking vengeance for the brave, For the brave—the brave—the brave!” III. But while with stern staccato notes this song Of simulated sorrow rolled along, A genuine gladness cheered one secret breast, One with a grief as genuine was deprest. To Amohia 'twas pure joy to be At length from that detested contract free, Released from nuptials the reluctant maid On various pretexts had so long delayed. For the good Chief could ne'er be reconciled To use coercion with his darling child, Who by the dreadful ‘tapu’ firmly bound Moved—a bright creature, consecrate and crowned, Inviolate and charmed, to all around. IV. The “tapu” was a fearful spell, Potent as creeds or guards or gold The power of Priest and Chieftain to uphold. The terrors of that ever-present Hell Outdid the threats of distant ones That faintly flame in far futurity— As might the roar of pointed guns A word would on your body bring to bear, The noise of thunder in the sky. And never did despotic cunning plan A fouler system for enslaving man, Than this mysterious scheme of fear and hate, The basis of their savage Church and State. True, the strange custom had its brighter side When for good ends resistless 'twas applied: What could compel the masses to combine Like it, their labour for each grand design— The great canoe—the long sea-sweeping seine Or hall for council where the chiefs convene? Where could true rights a trustier guard procure, Corruptless and invincible and sure? Yet most 'twas used as stonghold and as stay For the Aristocrats' and Hierarchs' sway; For though swift-gathering relative and friend Would prompt upon a culprit's tribe descend And, plundering by strict rule with much ado, Avenge each minor breach of this “taboo,” Yet, let but rank or priesthood be profaned, A direr doom the wretch who sinned sustained, More terrible than dungeons, gibbets, chains, Material penance, penalties or pains. No high divinity that hedges kings Could with this sheltering deviltry compare, Or forge for tyranny a subtler yoke. For chief and Priest at will or whim could dower Sticks—stones—most treasured or most trivial things With deadliest excommunicative power: And whoso touched them and the “tapu” broke Became anathema—accursed and banned— Infected and infectious; with a pang Of livelier terror shrunk from—shunned—than e'er Plague-spotted patient—canine madness—fang Of rattle-snake or cobra: Fiends were there To torture them; obedient, at the Chief's command. The “Wairua,” Spirits of the myriad dead,— And all the other invisible Spirits dread, All mystic powers that fill the Earth and Air, The “Atua,”—waited but a hint from him To dart into their victim—waste and tear His stricken vitals, cankering life and limb. Had not the boldest who from want of heed Some solemn “tapu” had infringed, been known When conscious of the sacrilegious deed, To die outright from horrible fear alone?— So well these savage Lords had learned How nature's mystic terror might be turned To means their own dominion to increase. Unseen executors of their caprice, Agents impalpable upheld their cause; Departed Spirits were their dumb Police, And Ghosts enforced their lightest Laws. V. But he whose grief was most sincere The news of that unwonted death to hear, Was Kangapo the “Tóhunga”—a Priest And fell Magician famous far and near; A Thaumaturge regarded with more fear Than any living or than most deceased. Men whispered that his very body swarmed (Crammed as a war-canoe with warriors armed) With evil spirits rustling thick As blue-flies buzzing in a wayside corse: And some more credulous would trembling tell How when demoniac inspiration quick And strong, in frenzy and full force Rushed on him (it was vouched for well) The grass would wither where his shadow fell; Or, were the sliding shutter of his door Just then left open, by the river side, Such deadly emanations would outpour, Mere strangers chancing in canoes to glide Beneath the house, had stiffened there and died. These tales were Kangapo's delight and pride. And yet his mien that dread renown belied; So calm and mild; his eyes deepset and dark Abstacted still and unobservant seemed; But those who dared to watch him long would mark How those dim eyes would on a sudden shift And glitter like a lizard's; then again Fall still and calm; and yet that glance so swift Seemed quite enough, as rapidly it gleamed, To single out and give his scheming brain All they could closely hide as clearly see. His voice was gentle too, and low, and sweet; So men compared him to the tutu-tree, Whose luscious purple clusters hang so free And tempting, though with hidden seeds replete That numb with deadly poison all who eat. And then his pace was stealthy, noiseless, soft, So that a group of talking people oft Turned round and found him, none knew how or whence, Close by them, with his chilling influence: As that great wingless loathsome locust bare, That scoops from rotting trees his pithy fare, With elephantine head and horny jaws And prickly high-propped legs—is sometimes found Upon your limbs or clothes, in sluggish pause, Inside the house; though none upon the ground Have marked him crawling slow from his retreat, The fire-logs, when dislodged by growing heat. VI. But Kangapo had reason to bewail; For had he not a hundred times foretold That should those Western Tribes his tribe assail, Those famed Waikáto, foemen from of old, Stout Tangi in the contest should prevail? And whence derived he confidence to make That prophecy so clear, beyond mistake? 'Twas from the doubled strength his tribe he knew Would gain from an alliance close and true With the brave borderers of the Central Lake. And what inducement could be found so strong To that alliance as the union, long Desired and schemed for, and as long delayed, Of Taupo's Chief with this surpassing maid? But now his plans were cut up, branch and root: And he must task his plotting wits again To find some other project to maintain The safety of his tribe—his own repute. For if he failed so notably, a stain Would on his fame indelibly remain. One thing was clear; he must not lose this lure, This bait, some splendid Kingfish to secure Among the Chiefs,—this matchless girl, on whom Himself, o'ermastered by her beauty's bloom Had sometimes cast a longing eye, in vain; For not his utmost art could passage gain Even to the threshold of her fair regard; His calm, insidious, slow addresses barred Their own access: her very flesh would creep Antipathetic, shrinking to its ward Instinctive, from his flatteries sly and deep. VII. So anxious now his auguries he plied For some forecast of fate his course to guide. First, by the solitary shore, he drove His gods into the ground: each god a stick Knobbed with a carved and tattoo'd wooden head, With fillet round the neck of feathers red; Then to each idol he attached a string; And in monotonous accents high and quick His incantations wild began to sing. But still the impatient patient Sorcerer strove With frequent jerks to make it yield a sign Whence might be drawn an omen of success: Nor this so difficult as you divine, Nor need the gift his Atua much distress. The slightest hint a Priest for answer took; Let but a grass-green parrakeet alight To pluck from some wild coffee-bush in sight, And nibble with his little moving hook, The scarlet berries; let some kingfisher Slip darting from the post whose summit grey He crowned—a piece of it—the live-long day— Long bill protruding from his shoulders high, Watching the lake with sleepy-vigilant eye— Looking so torpid and so loath to stir, Till that faint silver twinkle he descry; Let, gold-cuirassed, some hard ichneumon-fly Drag with fierce efforts to its crevice nigh A velvet-striped big spider, sore distrest, Struggling in vain and doomed to be the nest And food of that wasp-tyrant's worm new-hatched; Nay, less significant the sign might be For which the keen-eyed Sorcerer sung and watched; A passing cloud—a falling leaf—the key Might offer to unlock the mystery, Which with his wishes surely would be matched. VIII. Nor could our Augur set his mind at ease With simple divinations such as these: And he was almost tempted to invoke The Spirits of the Dead who sometimes spoke Through him, the Arch-Magician and Adept; Half tempted in his own case to accept Answers his own ventriloquism feigned; Ready to square his faith to his desire, And half believe supernal spirits deigned To prompt his organs and his speech inspire:— Could nothing, think you, less than mind unsound Sensation with volition thus confound?— But this he chose another Priest to try. So in their midnight haunted chamber they Summoned the dead, and drank in mournfully What the faint hollow voices seemed to say; Now like the nightwind through the crannied roof In longdrawn whistling whisper sighing by, Swelling and sinking, near and then aloof; Now melancholy murmuring underground, Then dying off up in the starry sky. Such the success impostors still achieve; Such Nature's final Nemesis for all Who teach to others what they half believe, To keep them fast in Superstition's thrall. From such a doom dreaming their own reprieve, Into the pits themselves have dug they fall; Their own deceptions do themselves deceive. Canto the Fourth. A Woodland Jaunt. 1. A new Nausicaa.

Miroa's tale of the ‘Maid-in-the-Moon.’ I. With merry laughter rang the air And feminine soft voices sweet; And acclamations here and there Of loud delight at skill more rare, Some happy hit or dexterous feat; And little shrieks at failing luck, The baffled aim, the striker struck; As Amohia on the ground Amid her damsels, scarlet-crowned With kowhai-flowers, a lively ring Playing at ‘poi,’ sent flying round The ornamented ball o'erwound And worked with vary-coloured threads, And loosely hung with dangling string Made fast above their rich-tressed heads— Fast to a single lightsome yew, One lone totára-tree that grew Beneath the hillside rising high Mid rocks and flowering shrubs. Hard by A little summer-dwelling peeped Deep-red, from foliage o'er it heaped Deep-green and lustrous—trees that bore In tiny flowers their promised store, Large berries of autumnal gold. Verandah-pillars, barge-boards broad, And balcony and balustrade, All rough and crusted with a load Of carved adornment quaint and bold— Concentric fret or face grotesque In rich red-ochred arabesque Relieved with snow-white touches—showed Gaily against that glittering shade, The thick karákas' varnished green. This cheerful cot, when days were hot, With its interior cool and clean,— Its floor, for fragrant orange-scent With faint tawhíri-leaves besprent; Its roof, and walls, so neatly lined (Between pilasters white and red) With tall pale yellow reeds close-laid And delicately intertwined And diamond-laced with sable braid Of leaves supplied, when split and dyed, By that thick-tufted parasite Which with its fleshy blossom-bracts The native as a fruit attracts— This cot was Amo's chief delight: And now while yet the day was new, And scarce the sun had dried the dew, She and her handmaids sported there. Quick hand and eye they each and all Displayed, as, arms and shoulders bare From side to side they whisked the ball: Nor is much need our lay declare How she, the Mistress-Maid, in face And form superb, and waving grace Of lithe elastic limb, whene'er The more erratic ball she tossed Or caught—or proud with easy air Regained her balance seeming lost, Outshone them all beyond compare. II. But see! at once the game is stopped, Each mantle, in its ardour dropped, Snatched quickly up, at once replaced: In coy confusion, giggling haste, Up start the girls of lower grade, As in his sailor-garb arrayed, Emerging from a neighbouring patch Of pinky-tasselled milky maize, A glimpse of Ranolf's form they catch And, pausing, he the game surveys. But Amohia calmly rose With courteous mien and gentle pride; A moment's blush she could not hide, Within her eyes a moment's light, Upon their lids a tremor slight, Alone lent import to the greeting She gave to him whose image bright Had left, since that first forest-meeting Her busy fancy no repose. The youth had come prepared to stay With presents and persuasive speech Results he feared that luckless day Might lead to; for the violence shown By his companions to atone: The ‘Sounding Sea's’ just ire appease, And heal if such there were, the breach Between his former friends and these. But as they scaled the steep ascent Up to the village rampart-pent, With high embankments, ditches wide And fighting-stages fortified; And passed the crooked entrance made Through double post and palisade With crossing withies braced and tied, The prudent Amo gave her guest A hint to let the matter rest; And then he learnt how she had laid Injunction on her babbling maid To hold her peace; and strange to tell The girl had kept the secret well. III. With blunt good-humoured haughtiness, A sturdy, proud and easy air Of sway unquestioned, frank no less, Did Tangi-Möana declare In briefest phrase how glad was he The stranger at his place to see. And then, the proffered food declined, To pipes and parley he resigned Himself, in sunshine while they basked; And many things it sorely tasked The hoary chief, the youthful friend, To illustrate, or comprehend, Attentive heard, acutely asked; About the white man's home and land, Why Ranolf left it, yet so young;— The tribes he knew—had dwelt among; The seaward chiefs and what they planned; Who were their friends and foes—and most The guns and powder they could boast, And all the wealth at their command From ships that trafficked on the coast. IV. Their meeting over, Ranolf strolled About the flat where gardens gay Bright in the morning sunbeams lay, With large-leaved roots and basking fruits That lolled on beds weedfree and clean As fairies had the gardeners been. Then with the younger folk, a few By Amo led, and one or two Most brisk or curious of the old, Crossed, paddling slow a large canoe, The gleaming Lake's unrippled floor To woody Nongotáha's shore, To wing the hours of sultrier heat With converse in a cool retreat. A hillside hollow—its sun-parched And slippery grass of golden hue, Green, like the half-ripe orange, grew Where feathery locust-trees o'erarched A little plot, an airy spot Their yellow-blossomed branches laid In luxury of emerald shade. There Ranolf flung him down, at rest, With that expansion of the breast Exultant—all that unreprest Abandonment to glad emotion— So fair a clime, a life so free, With health and strength and buoyancy Of spirit in supreme degree,— And more than all, and all enhancing, That blooming Child of wood and wild With shadowy hair and radiant face, That glossy glancing thing of grace With eyes in liquid splendour dancing, Or calm, as if from some high place Of bliss above this earthly scene Her soul looked forth with light serene No time could quench, no sorrow dim,— Might well excite, excuse in him, A careless castaway of Ocean. Before him lay no water, say A hollow Sky inverted—blue, With flecks of snowy sunlit flue, And mountains hung in crystal air With peaks above and peaks below Responsive,—every feature fair Reversed, in that transparent glow Deep mirrored; every ferny spur, Each puckered slope, and wrinkle sleek That creased their glossy forest-fur, Sure at the water's edge to meet Its upward-running counterfeit, Exact as roseate streak for streak Some opened Venus-shell displays, Bivalve with answering spots and rays. Far round were seen, o'er thicket green, By sandy shore, in darksome glen, Cloud-jets of steam whose snowy gleam, But that they moved not, you would deem The smoke of ambushed riflemen; But peaceful these, nor passed away For wind or hot refulgent day. White, bright, and still, o'er wild and wood, Like new-alighted Sprites they stood, Pure in the brilliant breathlessness: For breathless seemed the earth and sky Real and reflected; none the less Because at times there wandered by Over the sun-bathed greenery A soft air, lifting like a sigh Some tree-fern's fan, as if in sleep It stirred in the noon-stillness deep, Then sank in drowsy trance profound; That faint distress the only sign Of life o'er all the glorious sweep Of verdure streaming down the steep. So hushed the deep noon-glow around, So splendour-bathed that vault divine, The atmosphere so subtle-clear 'Twas rapture but to breathe it!—well Might these have made more sober, staid, Or pensive souls a moment fear To break the soft luxurious spell, The dreamy charm that wrapt the scene, With utterance even the most serene. V. But Life with too much force and heat In these young hearts impetuous beat For Silence; so the livelong day The stream of converse grave or gay From springs redundant flowed alway. Their superstitions, legends, lays, Could endless disquisitions raise; And our Adventurer, still inclining, Though neither sad nor very serious, To all that bore on Man's mysterious Links with the Life there's no divining— Learnt how for them, invisible throngs Of Spirits roamed all visible Space: All Nature was a human Face— A Sybil with a thousand tongues And teachings for their priests to trace, Excite, evoke with charms and songs: All Matter was all symbol—fraught With Love and Hate—with Will and Thought. Within a Man's own frame—without, Above, below, and all about, Nothing beyond his will that stirred,— His limbs in dreaming, beast or bird, Insect or thing inanimate, But 'twas oracular of Fate: The wild bird's song, the wild dog's bark, Were mystic omens, bright or dark; A leaf could wave, a breeze could blow Intelligence of weal or woe; Let but the wind creep through your lifted hair, Some God was present there; And if a rainbow overspanned A hostile band, As it to battle rushed, Already 'twas as good as crushed. VI. And then their legends—once again Recastings from the ancient mould; Gods, demigods and heroes old Of giant bulk and dwarfish brain. Greek, Gothic, Polynesian—all Primeval races on a train Of like ideas, conceptions, fall; Their supernatural Beings still Are but themselves in ways and will; And still the Superhuman race Keeps with the human steady pace; What Man would be—what Man has been, Through magnifying medium seen Still makes his God or Gods that grow With his Soul's growth—its reflex show By grand Imagination's glass Dilated; its best thoughts—the mass Of noblest feelings that exist— Projected with expanding rays Upon Eternity's dim haze, Like Brocken Shadows on the mist. And was it not so planned to give Mankind a fit provocative, At every stage from birth to age, The best devised to speed the Soul Towards Adoration's utmost goal? To guide his infancy and youth, Too weak to see the summits fair, Up an ascending mountain-stair To highest hidden peaks of Truth? And so Religion's self endow With that continuous life and glow Discovery lends, though painful, slow; That interest ever fresh and warm Which Science boasts her greatest charm? Though slow indeed Religion's rise Even to a glimpse of purer skies; Though foul and stagnant if you will The fens and swamps that clog her still. VII. But here the legendary lore The stamp of earliest ages bore; The stories told were wild and rude, Insipid mostly, pointless, crude: The simple guile, the childish wile, With savage deeds of blood and ire, And treacheries dull for vengeance dire; Gods, giants, men, all blood-imbrued. Uncouth the wondrous feats rehearsed, With lighter fancies interspersed: Recounted frankly, best and worst, Since none were met with sneer or scoff: —How Maui fished these Isles up first, And Kupé chipped the islets off. —How Tinirau—vain Chief! the same Who broad transparent pools outlaid Of water, which the mirrors made Where he his beauteous shape surveyed, Was yet of giant power to tame The great Leviathan he kept, A plaything and a pet, who came, Obedient from his boundless home; Through sinking hill and swirling trough Of Ocean, black through snowy foam, With ponderous swiftness crashing swept, Whene'er he summoned him by name; Or rolling over, at a sign From him, would smash the level brine Into great clouds of powdery spray, With thunder-slaps heard miles away. —How Pitaka would noose and draw Out of Earth's bowels by main strength, Out of his mountain-dungeon fell, Like periwinkle from its shell, The bulkiest time-worn Taniwha; Undaunted by his tortuous length Of notched and scaly back—his jaw Wide yawning, and obscenest maw With bones and greenstone trinkets filled, And weapons of his swallowed prey— Men, women, children, countless killed By this, of ancient tale and lay The wingless dragon—rather say Iguanodon or Lizard vast, Some caverned monster left the last Memento of a world bygone Earth's grinding changes had o'erthrown, Downliving with still lessening powers Into this foreign world of ours. —Then, too, how Márutúa drew His dragnets round a hostile crew, The thousand men he snared and slew— Beguiled to feast upon the strand And lend their seeming friend a hand In some great fishing-bout he planned. —How Hátu-pátu, as he lay Couched in a rimu-tree one day, Still as a tufted parasite, A mere excrescence, not to fright The birds that would close by alight, Nor mark his lithe and bending spear Along the branch more near and near Creep slowly as a thing that grew, Until with sudden thrust and true The noiseless weapon pierced them through— Himself was quite unconscious too, As thus he lay like one spell-bound, What long-curved claws were slowly stealing round The stem—or cautiously withdrew— Slowly retracted—then again protruded Amid the leafy shadows playing Upon the sunny-chequered trunk, Noiseless as they and unbetraying The lank and gaunt Witch-giantess That wholly hid, behind it slunk; Until he found himself, the watcher, Grim-clutched, and not the poor fly-catcher; Then in her cavern-home secluded Was kept in cruel-kind duresse To be as best he might, moreover, That Patu-paere's pet and lover! VIII. And next, fair Amo's handmaid—she Whose gaze of wondering curious glee Would Ranolf's gestures—looks—pursue, So pleasant seemed they, strange and new; Who, if his lively, joyous glance Alit upon the little maid, Would start half-back, as if afraid And half-disposed to run away, With look averted though so gay, And face half-hidden, and a play Of giggling blushes, bright and shy; Then with brown eyes—that all the day Would else with mirth and mischief dance, Keeping a sheltering friend close by, Would snatch a serious look askance, As quickly turned aside again Lest she be caught in that assay;— All with an artless sympathy, An interest undisguised and plain— Such fresh unconscious coquetry! Though little noticed by the rest Because with fancies of their own, Thoughts, feelings hitherto unknown, Too much amused and prepossest;— This shy and saucy Miroa told, With fluttering breath, slight-heaving breast, Looking at any but the guest To whom her story was addrest— How merry Rona, reckless, bold, Wetting one evening in a stream The leaves to make her oven steam, Cursed the fair innocent Moon aloud, Because she hid behind a cloud, And Rona, when the light was gone, Struck her foot against a stone; And how the solemn Moon in anger came Broadening and reddening down, and wound Her bright entangling beams around The affrighted Maid in vain resisting, Like a vast Cuttlefish around her twisting A hundred writhing trunks of chilly flame; Then rose with basket, Maid and all, And fixed them in her amber ball; “And this is fact for certain—doubt who will, Wait only till the moon shall fill Her horns—there's Rona with her basket still!” “A pretty fancy, pretty one!” Said Ranolf when the tale was done; “Come here, my child—let me repay Your story,—it will suit your hair This ribbon, though not half so gay, So beauteous as the wreath you wear.” And as the laughing girls beside, Caught, pushed her forward, held her there, The ribbon round her head he tied, For some such purpose brought; while she A-tremble with delighted pride, With pettish mock reproaches, aimed At them, not him, seemed, half-ashamed, Half-angry, struggling to get free. Canto the Fifth. The Legend of Tawhaki. 1. Amo tells the Legend of Tawhaki (the second chief Hero-God; Maui being the first). Creatures of the slime killed by Light. 2. To Ranolf it typifies Truth destroying superstitious creeds. 3. Hapae, a skyborn winged damsel, loves and leaves Tawhaki. 4. Seeking her he ascends to heaven by a spider-thread. Finds her and becomes a God. 5. Ranolf makes Hapae, Old Philosophy with its Immortal Hope, to be recovered by Science dealing with the sources of the physical. 6. Noblest discoveries psychical. 7. What the myth really indicates. I. Then Amohia, tapping Ranolf's arm, Said, “Listen, Pakeha!”—and with lifted hand, Rounding—Enchantress-wise When double soul she throws into a charm— The solemn archness of her great black eyes, Deeplighted like a well, An ancient legend she began to tell Of one God-hero of the land, Of which our faithful lay presents Precisely the main incidents: Adorning freely everywhere The better its intents to reach, The language so condensed and bare, Those clotted rudiments of speech: “Once a race, the Pona-turi—in the oozy depths of Ocean, Fierce, uncouth, in gloomy glory, lived where light is none, nor motion. More than anything created, Light, their bane, their death, they hated; So for Night they ever waited ere ashore they seal-like clambered To their house Manáwa-tanë—their great mansion lofty chambered; Whence, if e'er a windy Moon had caught them, you would see them hieing Homeward—sable shapes beneath the crisping silver floating, flying, Swift as scattered clouds on high their snowy courses gaily plying. “Young Tawháki, well he knew them—did they not his Father mangle? Hang his fleshless bones, a scarecrow, ghastly from their roof to dangle? Keep his Mother too, a slave, each day to give them timely warning Ere dark Sky from Earth uplifting left the first gold gap of morning? “Vengeance with his Mother then he plotted. So by daylight hiding In their houseroof-thatch he couched, his slimy foes' arrival biding. Darkness comes; they land in swarms; their spacious House they crowd and cumber; Revel through the midnight reckless; drop at last in weary slumber. Like the distant Ocean's roaring sinks and swells the mighty snoring.— Out then steals Tawháki chuckling; long ere day begins to brighten, Stops up every chink in doorway, window, that could let the light in: And the snoring goes on roaring; or if any Sleeper yawning Turned him restless, thinking, ‘Surely it must now be near the dawning,’ Growling, ‘Slave, is daylight breaking? are you watching, are you waking?’ Still the Mother answered blandly, ‘Fear not, I will give you warning— Sleep, O sleep, my Pona-turi—there are yet no streaks of morning!’ “So the snoring goes on roaring. Now above the mountains dewy, High the splendour-God careers it—great Te Ra, the Tama Nui. Sudden cries Tawháki's Mother, ‘Open doors and windows quickly! Every stop-gap tear out, clear out! On them pour the sunbeams thickly!’ Through the darksome Mansion—through and through those Sons of Darkness streaming Flash the spear-flights of the Day-God—deadly-silent—golden-gleaming! Down they go, the Pona-turi! vain their struggles, yells and fury! Like dead heaps of fishes stranded by the Storm-spray, gaping—staring— Stiffened,—so, astonished, helpless, lay they in the sunbeams glaring: Fast as shrink upon the shelly beach, those tide-left discs of jelly; Fast as leathery fungus-balls in yellow dust-clouds fuming fly off, So they shrink, they fade, they wither, so those Imps of Darkness die off!—” II. “Manáwa-tanë! ‘breath or life Of Man’—no doubt; a race at strife With Light!—were this a German tale, Not artless Maori, who could fail To hit its sense, extract its pith, So pregnant, palpable a Myth!” Thought Ranolf listening. “Darkness breeds A swarm of superstitious creeds That crush Man's Spirit till it bleeds; His Father—God! yes, him they clearly A terror make, a scarecrow merely, High up—unmoved—dry bones or worse To his abandoned Universe. His Mother, Earth—her wealth—her worth— Her schools—thrones—churches—mind and might— Enslaved so long, set day and night To warn and war against the Light,— Free Thought, the beautiful, the bright! Whose Sons not seldom from their eyes Shut out, dissemble and disguise Its full results—half-veil its rays (Till they shall gather to a blaze?) And fondly feign they nurse no seeds Of death to all those narrow creeds. Howe'er that be, the Sun will soar! His foes may slumber, rave, or roar— Yet Dayspring spreads o'er sea and shore; And now, even now, for all their din, The killing Light is streaming in!— But I attend. Bright-Eyes, proceed; Your Myth seems one who runs may read!” “Now, of heavenly birth to cheer him—beauteous from those blue dominions, Hapae came—divine—a damsel—floating down on steady pinions; Came, a moving moonbeam, nightly lit with Love his chamber brightly: Till that Spring-time of her bosom flushed out in a baby-blossom. Infant, it had infant failings. Once the dirt-delighted bantling, Scornfully Tawháki jeered at. Straightway all the mother mantling In her heart, her treasure Hapae caught up; to her plumy vesture Pressed it nestling; then upspringing with reproachful look and gesture, Sailed off to her skyey mansion, vanished in the blue expansion, Like an Albatross that slides into the sunset,—whitely fading With its fixed rare-winking vans, away into the crimson shading. Only ere she parted, while the lagging Westwind she invited Flapping her broad wings, a-tiptoe on the mannikin alighted (Red—its arms on knees akimbo—squat—the gable-apex crowning) One advice she waved Tawháki, more with grief than anger frowning: ‘If you ever feel the Child and Mother to your heart grow dearer, Ever wish to follow and to find us, O unkindly sneerer, And would climb by tree-dropt trailers to the Sky a little nearer, O remember, leave the loose ones; only take and trust to surely Such as hung from loftiest treetops, root themselves in earth securely!’ IV. “Many a moon he mourned—Tawháki. Then he started to discover Where they grew, those happy creepers, that could help a hapless lover. Many a moon he roamed—Tawháki. And his heart was sore and weary When he found himself despondent in a forest grand and dreary; (Ah! that wildering wildwood—who can tell how dense it was and tangled!) Where in wanton woody ringlets many a rope of trailers dangled. Rapt, absorbed in her pursuit, a blind old Crone those creepers tended; Caught at, groped and felt for any that within her reach descended. He, an ancestress discerning, ere for counsel he implored her, Touched her eyes, a charm repeating, and to sight at once restored her. Then they found a creeper rooted, finely for his purpose suited. Up he went exultingly, bold-hearted, joyous-eyed, firm-footed. At the treetop, see! a tiny spiderthread upshooting shiny, Wavering, viewless half, yet ever held aloft by mere endeavour! With a beating heart, Tawháki, muttering many an incantation— Wild with hope so high it takes the very hue of desperation, Clasps the clue so evanescent; then with yearnings deep, incessant, Seeing in the vault above him only Hapae's eyes that love him, Up and up, for ever upward mounts he dauntless—nothing scares him, Up through azure bright Abysses still that thread in triumph bears him! Suddenly a sunny grove is round him—cheery people working At a great Canoe, appear. All day he keeps the thicket, lurking, Till when balmy Shadow veils them and serenest Sleep assails them, Stripping off his youthful glory, out he steals, an old Man hoary; Strikes a few swift strokes, and magic-like the work is ended Graceful with its lofty stern, with open-circled fretwork splendid, Lo! the great Canoe completed! To his copse he then retreated; On another hollowed trunk next night the wonderwork repeated. —Those Celestials marvelled greatly; yet reflecting in their pleasure Such a worker were a treasure as a Slave beyond all measure, Watched and clutched that Old Man wilful—so decrepit yet so skilful, And to their great Ruler bore him.—O delight! who sits before him? 'Tis his beautiful benign One, 'tis his downy-plumed divine one, Hapae! will he now deride her or the subtle Elf beside her!— Kindly greeted, with caresses he the Child allures and presses To his heart no more to sever. Then, as he flings off for ever That disguise's dim defilement, Hapae smiles sweet reconcilement; Swift, the Child they bathe, baptize it, lustral waters o'er it dashing; And Tawháki—breast and brow sublime insufferably flashing, Hid in lightnings, as he looks out from the thunder-cloven portals Of the sky—stands forth confest—a God and one of the Immortals!” V. “More myth and deeper”—murmured he As Amo rose and bid them wait Her quick return: “But how translate In German style the mystery?— Shall Hapae our Urania be? The ‘meaning not the name’ were she?— And if Philosophy Divine Whose radiant features wont to shine With heavenly splendour, hopes so rare, To Man's enfranchised Soul resign Her charms celestial;—if their Child Hight Science seem at first defiled With taint its infancy may wear— Materialism—foul Despair— Shall he the wondrous birth despise? Perhaps of those imperial ties With Reason, free Enlightenment, That marriage made in heaven, repent— Until his fair Urania flies Despondent to her native skies? No, but from her he cannot sever— Can ne'er resist the lofty lure Of those aspiring eyes so pure! His must she be, to forfeit never, His hopeful, heavenly One for ever! But where to seek the Angel flown?— Can that dark forest overgrown Be Metaphysics? And the Crone So watchworn, Kant or Hegel is't? Some mighty Transcendentalist? Or some serene Sensationist With both his blinkers on? content, Nay proud, with his old-fashioned bent (Anile, perhaps?) to take and teach Just what his eyes and hands can reach?— Well! let the climber cling through all To truths they call ‘phenomenal,’ Well-rooted in the circle small Of our preceptions; and ne'er doubt, That, sown and springing from without, These parasites upon the Tree Of shadowy-leaved Humanity, (Like those depending trailers, sprung From floating seeds sky-dropt and flung Upon the bark wherefrom they shoot And reaching Earth take firmer root)— These, even these, shall point the way, The outlet find, some happy day, By triple-plied deductions, say, Or if by subtler clue it be, Some thread of fine analogy, To regions fair and fertile, where Undimmed by dense refracting Sense, Far in the Unapparent shine Truths and assurances divine Of God and deathless life confest, Where the sad Wanderer sore distrest May glad once more upon the breast Of his regained Urania rest!— VI. “With yet more truth the legend teems. Man's heaven's a heaven of Work it seems; Yet though his matchless Art reduce The World of Matter to his use; Carve out that grand design, until Its primal Force start forth compliant, His Science-Lamp's good Genie-Giant, Ardent to help him at his will, Achieve whate'er that will may dare, To walk the sea or ride the air; Nay, though his potent patient skill Work subtler witcheries, stranger still; Take weeds and turn their downy fluff To magic mirrors that retain Whate'er impress of loveliness May, flitting by, their surface stain; Take light, and its fine rays unravel Till they betray the inmost stuff The stars are made of whence they travel; Through continents and Ocean-caves Whisper a lightning-language; yet Not this alone his nature craves; All these a loftier race may set As tasks and triumphs fit for slaves Who cannot reach a nobler goal Nor conquer truths that touch the Soul! VII. “All fancy this! invention pure; That credulous complaisant whim With its foregone conclusions trim To which no Oracles are dim, No doting prophecies obscure. Myths may be construed many ways; Things take a hundred shapes in haze; In this world, like as Child and Mother, Matter and Spirit ape each other, Into each other shift and run— (Both, better known, may turn out one) And type and antitype around In all things may be feigned or found. Yet for all this, most true it is, That savage story strangely rings With echoes of profoundest things; Glows with the old celestial yearning; Nay glimmers with a faint discerning How nought can stifle or repress Man's upward tendency—the stress Towards ampler Being, nothing less Than high immortal Happiness.” Canto the Sixth. Mythical Cosmogonies. 1. A native Repast. 2. Maori Theogony and Cosmogony. 3. Ranolf jestingly personifies a materialistic God and Creator. 4. How they take it. The ‘Parson-bird.’ Intoning. 5. Love—the intruder. The Magician watching the Lovers. I. Then Amohia, who, her story ended, Had left the group, returned, not unattended. A sturdy stripling by her side, Te Manu, to herself by blood allied, Coal-curled, brown-cheeked, with beardless chin— Good-humour broadly shining in his wide Black eyes and teeth white-glistening through a grin— Came from the beach where the canoe was tied, And on the ground before the Stranger placed, That he the first might touch and taste, In flax-wov'n basket for a dish, A dainty pile of delicate fish In native style deliciously steam-drest; Like whitebait some; some boiled bright red, The small cray-fish in myriads bred, With sunk fern-bundles lifted from the Lake: Next, roasted fern-root pounded to a cake, Milkwhite and floury; and the choicer roots, The new potato and its substitutes, The kúmara and táro. Then a store Of jellies, ruddy-clear as claret, pressed And well preserved from fruits last season bore, Rich clusters of tupaki, luscious sweet; With water mixed their noontide thirst to slake, An innocent beverage truly! Rude the light Repast, and simply wholesome at the best; Yet scrupulously clean withal, it might Have satisfied a more fastidious guest. II. And when the talk began again, Said Ranolf, “How do you explain, You Maori, how the heavens were hung Up there? who spread the azure main? Whence Man and all things living sprung?” Prompt was an ancient Dame's reply, Of wrinkled cheek yet lively eye, Who took the pipe from her blue lips And sate in grizzled dignity, Proud of her crest that towered so high Of hoopoe-feathers, black with snowy tips;— Prompt was that ancient Dame's reply— Compact her scheme of rude Cosmogony: “There was Night at the first—the great Darkness. Then Pahpa, the Earth, ever genial, general Mother, And our Father, fair Rangi—the Sky—in commixture unbounded confusedly clave to each other: And between them close cramped lay their children gigantic—all Gods. He the mightiest, eldest, the Moulder And Maker of Man—whose delight is in heroes—Tumatau—the Courage-inspirer, the Battle-upholder; Tangaroa, far-foaming, the Sire of the myriads that silvery cleave the cerulean waters; And the solemn and beauteous Tanë, who gathers his stateliest, green-ever, trees-waving daughters Into forests, the sunny, the songster-bethridden; then Rongo—the peaceful, the kindly provider Of the roots that with culture are milkiest, pithiest; he too, who flings them in wilder and wider Profusion uncultured nor needing it—Haumia; lastly, the fiercest of any, the Rider Of Tempests—Tawhiri, joy-wild when his sons—when the Winds multitudinous rush with the rattle Of hail and the sting of sharp showers and the hurry of turbulent clouds to aerial battle. All these did the weight of vast Rangi o'erwhelm; there restlessly, rampantly, brother on brother Lay writhing and wrestling in vain to get free from the infinite coil and confusion and smother; Till the forest-God, Tanë, with one mighty wrench irresistible prized his great parents asunder— With his knotty and numberless talons held down—held the Earth and its mountain magnificence under, Heaved the Heavens aloft with a million broad limbs shot on high, all together rebounding, resilient: Then at once came the Light interfused, interflowing,—serenely soft-eddying—crystalline—brilliant!— Now the Sons all remained with the Earth but Tawhiri; he, sole, in tempestuous resentment receding Swept away at the skirts of his Father—the Sky; but swiftly to vengeance and victory leading His livid battalions, returned in his terrors, his kindred with torment and torture to harry: Tangaroa rolled howling before him—even Tanë bowed down; could his blast-besplit progeny parry His blows, or withstand the full pelt of his torrents that flung them o'er wastes of white Ocean to welter? Could Rongo do more ere he fled than conceal in the warmth of Earth's bosom his children for shelter?— No! they shrank from the Storm-God amazed and affrighted. One brother—Tumatau—alone durst abide him, Tumatau and Man stood before him unswerving, deserted by all, disregarded, defied him! But Man that defection still punishes daily; with snare, net and spear still their offspring he chases, Tangaroa's and Tanë's—the feathered—the finny; still turns up and tears from her tender embraces All that Rongo has laid in the lap of his Mother; while fiercely Tawhiri still plagues all their races— Ever wreaks his wild anger on blue Tangaroa, and whirls into spray-wreaths the billows he lashes— On the Earth whose rich berries and blossoms he scatters and scathes; on the forests he splinters and crashes; And on Man who stands firm when his thunder is loudest and laughs when his lightning incessantly flashes!” III. Said Amohia, “In your heart you laugh; You think all this is nonsense, to-e, ‘chaff;’ Nay then, O Stranger, answer in your turn, For still, you see, the Sun Has wellnigh half his course to run, Of his beginning—of the birth Of all things, Sea and Sky and Earth, What from their Sages do the white men learn?” Silent he scanned an instant's space The open eyes, the candid face Of the inquiring earnest Maid; Then as a half-satiric smile Twitched at the corners of his mouth, the while Lurked in his eyes a sly malicious twinkle, Rushed off into a wild tirade— Not caring if his words were clear or dim, Only obedient to the moment's whim, Somewhat like this: for we must sprinkle With thoughts and phrases freer and more flowery, The ruder baldness of his simple Maori; Or rather, quote in full the jesting rhyme Remembered from that Student-time, Of which some outlines he employed— With many explanations too 'Mid interruptions not a few— To give to her whose wonder he enjoyed, Some notion of a World-creator new, Or virtual Deity, which to content us— Your orthodox Materialists—a breed Large-swallowed for a subternatural creed— Have (or in reason might as well have) lent us: “There's a God they call Motion; a wonderful Being, Omnipresent, omnipotent! thinking and seeing, All life, birth, existences, creatures, conditions, Of his versatile skill ever-new exhibitions, Are but phases his phantasy, subtle or simple, Condescends to assume; from the faintest first dimple He indents in the vapour that veils him—beginning As he slides to a pirouette graceful and winning, Such a whirl of Creation, such Universe-spinning,— To his last of developments dense or ethereal, When as Consciousness crowned with a halo imperial, Though but grovelling in granules and cells ganglionic In the brain of Mankind sits the grand Histrionic! 'Tis the strangest and stoutest of creeds and convictions— 'Tis a God that defies and disdains contradictions: His adorers, though puzzled perhaps to say whether He is they, or they he, they are mixed so together;— (Though himself best proclaims his own glory Protean, When as lightning he dances with worship Judæan, Or intones as deep thunder his own Io-Pæan) His adorers as Deity scorn to avow him, Yet with faculties really divinest endow him! All the powers creative they scornfully ravish From the old-fashioned God of the million they lavish On this Phantom with faith unsuspecting and slavish! Then—like virgins once flung to that Sea-dragon scaly, At the shrine of their Pagod they immolate gaily Aspirations Humanity feeds upon daily; There consume, with serene suicidal devotion Whole heart-loads of lofty and tender emotion, All the foredawn of gold over Life's darksome Ocean. And they vary his victims with Logic—no little; Never spare Common Sense—not a fraction—nor tittle; Show no mercy for Sciences moral or mental; And for Metaphysicians—the tribe transcendental, Would burn them to cinders—a holocaust; striving On the ashes to keep their Divinity thriving. For strange though it seem, this Almighty Mechanic, Undesigning Designer of all things organic, Comes from nowhere himself: his own Father and Mother— Never caused though all-causing—derived from no other; And arranges, combines for such orderly courses His myriad myriads of multiform forces By accident only—repulsion—attraction— Into beautiful symmetry, uniform action; By headlong unweeting haphazard produces Profound adaptations to infinite uses; And as helplessly, stolidly stumbles on wonders, With as little intention, as others on blunders; Deaf and dumb, and stone blind, can make eyes, ears and voices, Till with Beauty—Light—Music—all Nature rejoices; Nay, unconscious beforehand arrives in due season By dint of mere going, at Thought, Sense and Reason; With no Mind, makes all Mind—that fine consummation, That can trace the back steps of the blind operation; Aye can soar on the wings of sublime calculation O'er the flaming far ramparts of star-filled Creation. So this Fetish—this Stock-God, this Impulse unguided, With no aim and no sense, yet success so decided, Still manipulates Atoms by no one provided Into Minds like vast Mountains a World overviewing;— With no better notion of what he is doing, Hits off Shakspeares and Newtons and Cæsars and Platos— Than the logs on the ashes which roast your potatoes: And the men who consider this creed satisfactory And would smile with mild pity on Sceptics refractory, Poor crawlers who crowd to a house with a steeple,— Are—some of the wisest and best of our people.” IV. To this effusion nought replied The listeners; only said aside, “The Stranger mocks us;” quietly— Too courteous for expressed dissent, Too proud to show astonishment Or ignorance of their Guest's intent. That laughing lunch-purveyor, he Only to Miroa muttered low: “A tito this—a fib, I know; 'Tis nothing like what Mapou says Of their white Átua and his ways; And he can tell, who visits most And learns all news that reach the coast. This Stranger too,”—and here the grin Grew broader,—“by his dress at least Is not a Tohunga, a Priest; For Mapou says, they always go In shining black from top to toe, With two white plumes beneath their chin, Just like that Tu-i, Mapou thought.” And Ranolf smiled, whose quick ear caught The fancy, as he saw just then The bird they spoke of, down the glen Come dashing, with its glossy coat Like jet-black satin shot with green And blue reflexions—at its throat Two dainty-pencilled plumes of snow; And once again admired, as oft Before, its lively ways and mien; As flitting, shifting to and fro It ransacked every kowhai-tree In yellow bloom, and loudly coughed And loudly whistled in its glee, And turned quite over, bending low Its busy head to reach and dip Into the pendent flowers and sip Their juice, in fluttering glad unrest, Unceasing in its honey-quest. “That may be true,” said Miroa, “too; For 'tis averred they are like a bird In this (although it seems a joke) They cannot speak like other folk, But always sing what they would say, E'en when they to their Átua pray.” —But here that feather-crested Dame Who this light chatter overheard Rebuked them—feeling it became Her sage experience to repress Such sallies of mere sauciness: “Oh foolish you! we always do Ourselves in all our prayers the same! Do we not sing for all we want? May they not know some potent chaunt To charm their Átua from his haunt, As we coax eels to leave the mud?”— Such reasoning they could not gainsay, It nipped their satire in the bud. V. Meanwhile, another Guest had been Among them though unnoticed and unseen; Joining their converse with no audible tongue, And speaking mystic Music without sound; On whose mute melodies the listener hung; Whose viewless Presence brightened all around. Who should it be but that Consoler dear, Heartwhispering Paraclete of priceless cheer— Who but the Enchanter—Love? whose witchery flings Fresh life round Daybreak's life-enlivening springs; Heaps Noon on Noon for fervour; double-dyes For deeper pathos Eve's empurpled skies. Did he not use his artless Art that day With slightest means most meaning to convey? Some idle question asked as if in sport, Some falter in the tone or breath drawn short— Some touch of tapering fingers—touch so fleet, They seem, just seem, as they a moment meet, To linger ere they leave the contact sweet? Or scorning all less subtle ministries Did He not speak through Amohia's eyes, Whose lids and raven lashes though they fell Dark as a closing bird's-wing o'er their light Upon her rich warm cheek, could never quite Shut-in their lustrous tenderness, nor quell Their rebel glances eloquent of Him, More than the mother-bird can fold with hers Her crowd of small quick-running loiterers So closely, safely, that no single one Of all the nestling, jostling train May slip a moment out into the sun, Although next moment gathered in again; Whene'er that brooding mother sees The stiff-stretched hawk across the blue vault swim; As once or twice amid the trees Had Amohia marked the Priest appear, (Though vanishing almost as soon as seen) With eyes inscrutable and dim Watching herself and Ranolf; though with mien Not threatening now, malignant nor severe, Whatever cause she had to fear. —But who could tell what hatred fell, What dark designs might not be found Within his heart whose face no less Was such a smooth and placid screen?— How many a man amid the press, Is but a walking Wilderness,— Like some fierce Ameer's hunting-ground By lofty walls concealed, confined: Caverns interminable wind, Abysses yawn, those walls behind; There wild beasts prowl and moan and howl Of lust and greed and all excess; They peer and pry who wander by— The smooth fair walls are all they spy. But little of his looks recked they, Which though they keenly glanced their way Did yet no ill intent betray. So from redundant springs all day Flowed streams of converse, grave and gay. Canto the Seventh. The Captive. 1. Ranolf seized. 2. Where imprisoned. 3. Prospect of death. 4. A midnight visitor. 5. Plot against him explained. 6. The first Kiss. 7. The parting. Amo's despairing song. 8. Nature helps Love. I. O'er all the East the sunset's flush From plain to peak began to rise; That slowly-fading fever flush Of beauteous Day before she dies. The friends again had reached the Isle And for a little space had parted; Those elder women kindly-hearted About the evening meal employed: Their guest had strolled away awhile, And by the Lake the painted eve enjoyed; There, tempted after all the sweltering heat By the cool water glistening black In shade behind a green spur's shelving back, Which seemed a place for bathing meet, Had passed some wooded rocks upon his right Into a thicket where karakas veiled The path in gloom almost as dark as night— When from behind he felt himself assailed By ambushed men unseen, unknown; Before he could resist was overpowered; A mantle o'er his head was thrown, His arms and feet fast pinioned; nor availed His stifled shouts, the threats and taunts he showered Upon his dastard foes, who answered nought But with determined silence and one will Their struggling captive rapidly conveyed O'er rocks and rooty paths (he thought) Where branches oft their way opposed Into some place from outer air enclosed; For cooler seemed and yet more still The atmosphere; and on his sense the smell Of the dried rushes used in buildings fell. There on the ground the luckless youth they laid; And when a sliding panel was made fast With cautious footsteps out of hearing passed. II. Now left alone, the youth contrived to free His head, and strove his prison-place to see. All round was sombre darkness; but it teemed With great white ghastly eyes that strangely gleamed With pink and silvery flashings here and there, And seemed to float and throb in the dun air; Then by degrees grew motionless, and fixed On him one savage and concentred gaze; And slowly he discerns, those eyes betwixt, Features gigantic—furious—in amaze; Wild brows upbranching broad, yet corrugate With close-knit frowns ferocious; blubber lips Stretched wide as rage and mockery can strain Mouths—monstrous as the Shark's when 'mid the ship's Exultant crew he gnashes in dumb pain— That grin grotesque, intense and horrible hate, And thrust out sidelong tongues that from their root The very frenzy of defiance shoot. So, with malignant and astonished stare They gaze, as if the intruder's blood to freeze. At length, accustomed to the gloom, he sees What dwarfish forms those ponderous heads upbear; Their crooked tortoise-legs, club-curved and short; Their hands, like toasting-forks or tridents prest Against each broad and circle-fretted breast; And all the fact discerned at last, he knows These pigmy-giants form red-ochred rows Of rafters and pilasters to support A spacious hall;—some carved in high relief; While others standing from the walls aloof Piled up in pillars of squat monsters rise Perched on each others' shoulders to the roof. The tribe's great Council-Chamber this should be, Their Wháre-kúra, Hall of sacred Red, For worship—justice; where the most adept, The glorious deeds of their ancestral dead, And pedigrees that back for centuries crept, Safe in their memories by rehearsal kept. Those forms were effigies (he might surmise) Each of some famous ancestress or chief; But to his fancy now the crowd appeared A Gorgon-eyed and grinning demonry Whose fiendish rancour his misfortune jeered. III. And bitter were his feelings as he lay To dark forebodings, anxious fears a prey: What could have caused this outrage? whose the deed? Or what its object? in his utmost need Where could he look for succour? how escape The doom that threatened him in some dread shape He scarce could doubt, although the thought might strike His cooler mind, so unprovoked a wrong Done by these islanders, was little like (As all his past experience would attest) Their usual treatment of a peaceful guest. And though the tide of his regrets ran strong With self-reproaches that a careless hour Had placed his life within their savage power, Mokoia's Chief he felt could never be Privy to such a wrong!—The ‘Sounding Sea’ Had spurned such crafty craven treachery. His natural spirits at the thought revived; And he resolved forthwith to be prepared The moment that his unknown foes arrived And loosed his bonds, to spring upon them—dash Between then—struggle—lose no slightest chance But do and dare whatever might be dared Or done, however desperate, wild and rash, That might accomplish his deliverance. Or if no opening should occur for swift Decisive force or dexterous agile shift, He still would try what gentle means might do,— Never despair! in worst extremes he knew So many chances to the brave accrue, Hopes to the true heart come so often true! But should all fail, and he be doomed to die, Ah, could he help but feel—no soul so dull As not to feel—how deep the misery— The bitterness to leave a world so full Of vivid beauty, varied life and joy, 'Twould scarce the wisest even in ages cloy! Yet even then he had the heart to rest In trust his great All-giver would invest— Out of the infinite exhaustless store Of Life he loves with lavish hand to pour Thick as a mist of dew-drops over all The inconceivable array of star-worlds more In number than the sands on ocean's shore— His soul with new existence; though to dust This apparition of mere clay should fall, Its present phantasm. “What!” so ran the train Of thoughts that darkling hurried through his brain Like caverned ocean-tides—“‘Is man more just Than God?’ that immemorial chime Asked out of Arab wastes in earliest time; And why not ask, Is he more generous, too? Should not God's great beneficence outdo What Man could in conception and in will Be equal to? should He not spare Another life—a hundred if need were, To beings into whom his loving care Did such deep longing for the boon instil?”— Yes, he would trust in this his extreme need The Infinite; who if infinite indeed In aught, is infinite in Love as well That must our own heart's highest love excel. So with firm patience he resolves to wait, Whatever be its form, his coming fate. IV. Two hours or more had dragged their weary way While cramped with chafing bonds in pain he lay. Those stony eyes had faded from his sight When deeper fell the shades of growing night. Far, far away his mournful thoughts had flown To friends and scenes in happy boyhood known; When—hist! a rustling sound that softly falls Upon his ear, his wandering mind recalls; He listens—all is silent—then again The rustle and slight creak are heard—'tis plain Some cautious hand has thrust aside the door— Some noiseless foot steals light along the floor. The form that owned them had a moment hid The patch of moonlight where the panel slid Away—too briefly for his eye to trace Its outline—guess its purpose; to his side, So stealthy, swift and noiseless was its pace, The shadowy Shape seemed less to walk than glide. Could this some midnight murderer be? his heart Beat quick as over him that Shadow bent— Quick as the sweet breath felt upon his face, That Phantom's breath, that quickly came and went As if in his emotion it took part. A soft voice whispered: “Stranger—hist! no word— 'Tis I—'tis Amohia!”—Then she fell To her kind work, and every cutting cord Sought out and severed with a sharpened shell. Upsprung the youth, to life and joy restored; And rapturous thanks had to the Maid outpoured, But that her hand upon his lips was laid, But that her lips in briefest whisper prayed What her unseen more eloquent looks implored: “O for your life no sound! but follow me— Who knows how near your deadliest foe may be!” V. So through the doorway stealing in the dark, She makes the panel fast, and he may mark Less-pleased, that silvery blue solemnity That mingles with the bowery trees hard by. Then in the open, silently they creep, They, and their shadows thrown so sharp and deep. Upon a terrace half way up a cleft Or hollow on the mountain's northern steep, 'Mid tufts of flax, tall-bladed, bright as glass, And ferny tree-clumps, stood the house they left. See! by a hut which they perforce must pass, Across their very path, three youths, asleep In the warm moon upon the sun-dried grass Are lying!—'twould be ruin to retreat:— The Maiden's heart, he almost hears it beat! Each foot placed firm before the last is raised, They step between the knees so nearly grazed: And soon are safe beneath the blessed shade By trees—themselves as still as shadows, made. Then round the island's end, that fear allayed, Beneath its woody western slopes they steal, Where they may speak secure, and she reveal, The cause and author of the base assault Her friend had suffered. Kangapo's the fault— That priest's, and not her father's, she averred: For Kangapo's sole aim, he might have heard, The one great passion that his bosom stirred, The main pursuit in which his life was spent, Was, next his own, their tribe's aggrandizement. For this, by his advice, almost from birth, Herself had been made ‘tapu’ to her grief, To Taupo's Lord—an old whiteheaded chief, Of mighty power, no doubt, high rank and worth; And though this marriage of her dread and hate That landslip had relieved her from of late, Yet much she feared—the Priest already planned Some other proud disposal of her hand; So jealously he watched, so little brooked The slightest glance of any youth who looked With any (here she checked herself)—at least Of any one who talked with her awhile. And so that day when she observed the Priest Eye them so keenly with his crafty smile, Although deceived a moment by his guile, It roused suspicions, strengthened when she saw Again, on their returning to the Isle, He noticed Ranolf from the group withdraw At sunset; and himself stole off so soon By the same pathway towards the western wood; She followed; for the thing could bode no good; But by another track; had seen him meet Four men to whom his slightest wish was law, Then to a copse of mánuka retreat Where they could safely, secretly commune; Had crept close-up on tiptoe—overheard Their vile atrocious project every word; To seize, bind, bear the Stranger to their great Runanga-house; there leave him bound and wait The setting of the Moon, till they could take Their captive to the middle of the Lake, Where they would throw him overboard, still bound; And tell her Father next day how they found The Stranger at his evening meal—with food— Aye, food! beside the monument that stood High carved in their most sacred burial-ground O'er his most famous ancestor's dead bones: And though a bird sung on it all the while— Doubtless the spirit of that Chief renowned, It still could not prevent the outrage vile:— Would not such impious sacrilege astound The boldest?—how aloof the crime they viewed With hair on end, tongues to their palates glued In speechless horror, motionless as stones: But how his Ancestor's insulted Shade With vengeance dire the deed profane repaid; For when the Stranger launched his boat again There was no ripple on the watery plain; Yet scarce a spear-flight had he left the bank Before his boat without a breeze capsized, And with it—he with scarce a struggle—sank; For all his powers that Spirit had paralyzed. This was the plot concerted then and there; And next she noted where his boat they hid To make all points of their narration square; And Miroa was to bring it, as she bid, Round to a spot they presently would reach,— Yes! there she saw them waiting on the beach! The rest he knew. “But now, O Stranger, haste! Fly to your skiff—O not a moment waste In words—already, see! the Moon is low— Away, before your flight those traitors know!” He turned to thank her—would not take her nay; Despite her struggles clasped her to his breast, And ere from his embrace she broke away Upon her lips a shower of fervent kisses prest. VI. O in all climes and every age a token Of one bright link for suffering mortals left With the Eternal and Divine unbroken— By all Earth's strain and tears untarnished and unreft!— O tempting—time-worn—ever-during theme— That first fond kiss of Love! first dazzling gleam When two surcharged electric Love-clouds meet— Flash Paradise into the mutual dream Of rapt twin-spirits in a lightning-stream, And blend in blissful rest their soul-entrancing heat!— Most surely is the Heav'n-glimpse visible there, When some young creature, innocent as fair, Supreme Civilization's tender heir, Such first faint utterance of true love may dare. The wondrous, pure, envelopment divine Of fearful awe and maiden scruples fine— That trembling kiss has broken through it now, Like the first crocus peeping through the snow. Oh timid touching of a terrible joy Whose sweet excess would almost ask alloy! First hesitating step within the range Of unimagined worlds—enchanted—strange!— Ah! break off there, young throbbing hearts! Ah stay, Let that ecstatic dawn ne'er darken into day! The quivering brilliance of that hour so tender, Love's disc emerging o'er the horizon's rim, Does not its molten palpitating splendour Leave vulgar Noon and its refulgence dim? Oh might that Morn its freshness ne'er surrender, But still in blinding innocency swim!— Vain thought!—save one such bud of bliss, unblown— And laws that rule the Universe were gone! But now, the kisses prest with youthful passion On Amohia's lips were not alone The first those lips from one she loved had known, They were the first she ever felt at all! A novel mode—a strange too fervent fashion, Of salutation or caressing this! What aid, what safeguard to her side to call, This subtle soft assailant to repel, This cunning and insidious foe—a kiss! Was it not thrice too thrilling? might not well This meeting of the lips and breath appear, Spirit to spirit—soul to soul to bring Too dangerously close—too fondly near? Through joining lips heart seemed to heart to cling; And had not breath and spirit but one name— In hers, as many a rougher tongue, the same?— But she has torn herself away—“Oh go, Ranoro, only go! haste—haste, or they Will track us here!” She could,—she would not say For fear more than those choking words, although Such briefest farewell seemed a knell of woe. “Farewell, then, dearest! till we meet once more!” He said, and pushed off quickly from the shore. VII. She gazed unmoving—watched his boat depart, With desolation dragging at her heart. Just then the ill-omened Moon withdrew behind A sable cloud-stripe, sudden, as if dropped— Dead Nun! into a coffin snowy-lined. Then swelled her heart with tears her pride had stopped; Weeping she stole the silent trees among, Weeping reproved her weeping with a song; For the spontaneous song her sadness moaned, Provoked the very weakness it disowned; Racking her bosom with its feigned relief, And bitter comfort that redoubled grief. 1 “Leave me! yes, too dear one, leave me! Better now, when least 'twill grieve me! While unrisen, unconsuming, Love's red dawn is but illuming With faint rays our spirits glooming— Oh while we can bear to sever, Let us part and part for ever! Part with wishes—vows unspoken, Tears unshed and hearts unbroken! 2 “O this feeling! who shall cure it— Teach the Maiden to endure it?— Where is he, whitebearded, holy, Who shall lead his daughter slowly To the waters melancholy? Lead his love-afflicted daughter To the still, estranging water?— Where the pool so gloomy-shining, Can relieve this love-repining? 3 “She has let it charm too dearly, Lull too fondly, touch too nearly, That sweet sorrow; now unwilling, In the wave so soothing, chilling, Pure, translucent, passion-killing, He must lave her—chaunting faintly Hymns so piteous, hymns so saintly! Then shall cease this yearning—sighing, With the mystic measure dying.” VIII. So parted they—and so they strove apart Each to repress the risings of the heart; Each to rake out, ungerminant, ungrown, The seed in fertile soil too richly sown. Yet in her own despite, it seemed, the Maid, Was still recalled to something done or said By or about the Stranger; to her breast Tidings of him like wild birds to their nest Would fly it seemed as to their natural rest; The slightest news that floated in the air By some attraction seemed to settle there; Nor ever seemed there lack of such, or dearth Of Fancy's food; for desert wastes of Earth Blush nectared fruits, and the blue void above Rains mystic manna but to nourish Love! BOOK THE THIRD. ALL IN A SUMMER NIGHT. Canto the First. Miroa's Tidings. 1. Amo watching Ranolf's boat. Her song. 2. Indoors weaving; sings again. 3. The ‘Grasshopper a burden.’ 4. Evening; news of another proposed alliance for her. 5. Her revulsion of feeling. 6. Earthquake. 7. A resolve (8) acted upon. I. True Love is like a polype cut in twain, And doubled life will from division gain. Fond Amohia could not in her pain Of stifled passion, though she strove, refrain From stealing sometimes to a lonely spot Where all before her lay the Lake serene, And she could see the glimmer of the cot Her heart divined was Ranolf's: there with mien Expectant on the mountain-side unseen In thick red-dusted fern would couch until From the dim baseline of the opposite hill A white speck disengaged itself and grew Into a sail; or sometimes,—for to while The time when sport was slack or weather bad, With help from native hands, our sailor-lad Had fitted up a light canoe With keel, mast, sails, and rudder, too, And sculls in European style,— Sometimes a dark spot she descried With flashing twinkle on each side That neared and neared till clear in view The light skiff, in a mode so new, Its single occupant though backward going At once with two long paddles rowing, Came skimming the blue calm, and still With sharp keel seemed to slit the thin Glazed surface of the shining Lake That shrank apart in widening wake As shrinks beneath the sacrificial knife Some forest victim's opening skin Discoated of its fur and warm From the last pants of its wild woodland life. There as she sat alone and long, Like one who murmurs low some potent charm, In fervid words her love would simmer into song: 1 “Now should He come, whose coming for a while Will make all Nature smile. O bless my longing sight, Dear one! whose presence bright I hail with more delight, Than birds the sunrise thrilling through each rapture-ringing cover, Than trees the spring-time when they glow with gladder green all over! The Sun is dim without thee, dearest, Joy's self looks sad till thou appearest!— See, he comes!—O dull, dull Lake! How canst thou sleep so blue—nor wake— Nor rise and wreathe with loving spray my own, my darling lover! 2 “O slim white Sail, whose every curve of grace So fondly now I trace, Each silver shape you try Only to charm his eye Ah, happy Sail! and fly, Because you know, howe'er you strain, he still is with you steering— Nay! but you only feel, slight Sail, the faint wind's fickle veering:— O envied Wind! that hampered never Might fondly fold my Love for ever Wholly in one airy kiss; Yet coldly can renounce such bliss, And on your disenchanted way go heartlessly careering! 3 “You vapoury columns that from hotsprings rise (As from my heart such sighs) So white against the green, And through the day serene, Now this, now that way lean, And easier postures seem to take for silent contemplation, O why not always turn towards him in speechless admiration! But you, dark Clouds! that grate with thunder While on the leaden gloss thereunder, Silvery rings the fishes make Are glistening, fading on the Lake— Flash, murky Clouds, O flash elsewhere, your muttered indignation! 4 “O Sail, O Bark, O happy Wind, O Lake,— All happy for his sake, Why cannot I too rest Indifferent, unopprest, No aching at the breast— Why not behold a beauteous thing with heedless airy pleasure, Sleep, sport or speed away like you, untortured by the treasure!— But I must moan and writhe and languish, And almost envy in this anguish The poor fishes, for they die, But close to him—beneath his eye:— And death with him to life without, O who its bliss could measure!” II. So on the hill would musically moan The love-sick Maid; but in the house alone Her songs would take a deeper, sadder tone:— “Tears, tears!—Oh do not trickle down, Oh sleep within your fount unknown! Oh rack my heart but rise not, lest Cold eyes discern you, and divine the rest. “Oh for some cavern unespied Whereto I may escape and hide! Lest my deep love, in my despite Leap up, and break away into the light!—” Such was the burden of an ancient lay Half to herself she murmured as she sat Apart from her companions one bright day Making a broidered border for a mat. From sloping roof to earthen floor Two staffs were fixed the Maid before; Upon a line between them strung Fringe-like the flax-warp loosely hung; She worked the woof in thread by thread; Inserting deftly, plaiting, tying Into the web as on it sped More coloured threads beside her lying: Her task without a model plying, She wove with interchange ornate Of spaces crimson black and yellow— Triangular or tesselate, Responding each one to its fellow— The silky fibres intricate: Like some Pompeian pavement's old Mosaic, rich with contrast bold Of vivid colours, tasteful, true, The fair design her fancy drew Beneath her nimble fingers grew. But ever and anon she stopped, A thread was tangled, missed, or dropped;— What but some ill-concealed distress Could mar such manifest address With quite unwonted awkwardness? How could she speed her at her task so trim, With thoughts so wandering and with eyes so dim? III. Then in this fever of despondence, finding Her restlessness she could no more restrain, Struggling her mien and movements to compose, Though scarcely able to refrain From rushing—out into the air she goes. She steps into the noon-glare hot and blinding; But what a gush of gladsome sound At once assails her!—like the winding Of tiny watches numberless, all round Unceasing streams the loud-vibrating hiss Of gay cicadas in their summer bliss. O it tormented her—it pained Her soul, that emulous shrill monotony Of exultation so persistent and sustained.— She turns to where the Lake, a mimic sea, The pebbled beach with pleasant murmur laves; Hastily she hurries onward now, Now rests as wearily—wearily watching how Distorted by the heaving crystal, the bright stones And tremulous streaks between them clear, Still float up, vanish, reappear With endless iteration as the little waves Keep rolling—rolling in. O then she moans In very impotence to bear The placid, playful happiness, The obstinate calm contentment they express As if in mockery of her despair. She flings herself upon the grass With passionate floods of tears:—Alas, But who can weep away a woe? Tears for each flood are readier to reflow; Or if with the worn frame at length Exhausted, still revive with its reviving strength. IV. Now the long splendours of the day were past; The gorgeous tints of Eve subsiding fast; The Western hill-tops touched with solemn rays; Their slopes in chestnut-hued and chocolate haze Thin-veiled, that melted downwards into gloom Blue as the ripened plum's white-misted bloom: While the reflected roseate richness steeping The East, slunk fading up from lake and shore, From mountains next, and last the sky, before The purple gray of shadow upward creeping; All the flushed sunset sobered into boding awe;— When Miroa, coursing quick from side to side, Tossing to any one she saw A merry word her aim to hide,— With careful show of carelessness— Her anxious flutter anxious to repress— Her object to seem objectless— Came like a quivering flittermouse, Came darting through the gathering dusk to Amohia's house. Bursting with news she longs yet fears to tell, The darkling room she first examines well, Lest any listener be lurking near; Then whispers in that Maiden's ear, How all day 'twixt her father and the priest The close and covert converse ne'er had ceased; Till they determined there should be despatched An embassy to Nápuhi's famous Chief With offer to bestow her—Amo's hand Upon his son Pomáre: how, in brief, She for young Kárepa had watched, Who to the mission was attached, Waylaid him on the road and wormed His secret from him—as she well knew how;— He teased her with his love so often now! But had not Kangapo with truth affirmed, No match more advantageous could be planned For her—none give her Sire such right to stand, With unconstrained and equal brow Proudly amid the proudest of the land?— This was a marriage,—must she not confess The priests would all conspire to bless; Aye, raise to frenzy-pitch their rival tune Of incantations to the Sun, the Moon, The winds, and all the powers of Earth and Air, To be propitious to the bridal pair? V. Shocked—terrified—the Maiden heard The tale with obvious truth averred; She flushed and paled; her blood suspended, All life seemed fading from her brain; Then the hot current spirit-stirred, Back from her strong heart rushed again, And high she rose above her pain. Her doubts, her hesitation ended, This—this—she felt had sealed her doom: O dread! to-morrow well she knew Once more she might be made taboo: And what could break that hideous chain! The threatened fate she could evade Only by flight—swift—secret—undelayed! All the sheet-lightning that had played In pointless passion round her soul so long, Condensed by this compulsion strong, Shot into arrowy purpose, clear against its gloom. VI. As through the land when some dread Earthquake thrills, Shaking the dark foundations of the hills; Their grating adamantine depths, beneath The ponderous, unimaginable strain and stress, Groan shuddering as in pangs of worldwide death; While their long summits stretched against the sky Rough-edged with trackless forests, to the eye A double outline take (as when you press The eyeball); and the beaten roads below In yellow undulations roll and flow; And in broad swamps the serried flax-blades lithe, Convulsed and tortured, rattling, toss and writhe, As through them sweeps the swift tremendous throe: Beasts howling run, or trembling, stand and stare, And birds, as the huge tree-tops swing and rock, Plunge scared into the more reliable air:— All Nature wrung with spasm, affrighted reels Aghast, as if the heavy chariot-wheels Of the material God Man's infancy Devised, in very truth were thundering by In too intolerable majesty:— Then he who for the first time feels the shock, Unconscious of its source, unguessing whence Comes flying o'er him, with oppressive sense Of irresistible Omnipotence, That boundless, strange, o'erwhelming influence, At once remote and in his inmost heart,— Is troubled most, that, with his staggering start All the convictions from his birth upgrown, And customary confidence, o'erthrown, In Earth's eternal steadfastness, are gone: Even such a trouble smote in that wild hour Our Maiden—such revulsion shook her soul, As o'er her swept that sense of doom—a power And dire compulsion spurning her control! All feelings that had been her life-long stay Seemed from their deepest root-holds wrenched away; No more could her convulsed, afflicted breast, On childhood's loves or home-affections rest; Her Being all upheaving seemed to be Cast loose and drifting towards an unknown Sea; Her heart's young world uptorn—receding fast, Far rolled the echoes of the fading Past:— She stood alone—herself her sole support at last. VII. 'Tis Night;—the Maiden steals along the shore How lone the aspect at that hour it wore! How shelterless from all dread things—so deemed Her superstition—wherewith Darkness teemed! All the familiar friendliness of Day, And all its life and stir, subsided—sunk— Within that circling fence shut up and shrunk, Where, snake-like coiled, the sleeping Village lay Miles distant now its very precincts seemed. She speeds to where her people use To leave afloat their red canoes; A new misfortune! all and each Are high and dry upon the beach; The lightest well she knew would prove Too heavy for her strength to move. Was she distrusted? her design Betrayed? she cares not to divine: Her spirit not a moment falters; Not once her cheek its colour alters: As he who desperate only tries To strike one stroke before he dies, And hardly wincing, never heeds Some fresh deep wound as fast he bleeds— So this last stroke the Maid receives; So with impatient patience shuts, Though to her heart it keenly cuts, Her heart against it; if she grieves, That grief can silently repress With one sad smile of bitterness, (The choking at her throat no less) While to her aim she calmly cleaves. Shall this defeat her fixed intent? The Lake her purposed flight prevent? Her favourite haunt, almost from birth In many an hour of fearless mirth, Her life beside it had been spent, 'Twas like her natural element! With throbbing breast, with lips comprest, She flings her quick and lighted glance Determined o'er its dark expanse: That further shore was distant—dim— But better death than turning back! No way but one! yes, she will swim— Her daring path unaided track Across that plain so still and black!— Did not her own great Ancestress Once swim that Lake in like distress? Might she not dare and do the same? Did she not feel as true a flame?— She keeps before her mind, despite The spirit-haunted gloom of night That hid its waters shadowy-bright, Its daylight image, tempting, dear, Light blue and beautiful and clear!— She tries in vain to recognize The rolling mountain-slope where lies The hut that holds her love—her life; But as with daylight details rife She bids the cherished picture rise, She feels the spell of kindly eyes; One kindly voice inviting cries; One living presence sweeps from view The distance and the darkness too; Before its thrilling influence driven, All scruples to the winds are given! What to her is far or near? What has she to do with fear!— Her light dress lightly flung aside— See! she has dashed into the waters wide! VIII. Delicious to her throbbing heart— Delicious to her fevered brain Was that cool loving water! Eagerly She dipped her head, again—again— As if it could appease the inward smart, Could charm away the choking pain. Then fully conscious first she seemed to be How she had launched upon her lonely way; As from a dream first perfectly awoke To all the dangers of her bold essay. So singling out and noting well A star, that near the mountain's verge Obscure and vague, hung just above The spot as even in darkness she could tell Whence she had seen his boat emerge So oft, as on her hill-top she would bask On that forlorn look-out of Love,— She fixed upon its twinkling spark Her course to guide, her goal to mark; Then with a calmer pulse and steadier stroke, Gave herself up to her adventurous task. Canto the Second. The Song-cheered Swimming. 1. Amo in the Lake. Water-fowl. 2. Song of a damsel eloping in a canoe. River scenery. 3. Rest on a tree-stump half-submerged. 4. Thoughts of her father. Love resistless. I. Swim, Amohia, swim!—with strong swift grace she swims; Lightly in silence cleaves the pathway smooth. The water's gurgle from her waving limbs, Only its ripple from her flexile limbs— Seems less to break than gently soothe The hush of solemn Silence as she swiftly swims. And now the cooling lymph more calmly breasting, She comes upon some wild-fowl resting: And as soft-plashing she intrudes Into their glassy open home so wide, And feels the solemn still impress Of sweetly-sheltering loneliness— “Safe in their gleaming solitudes” She sighs, “each bird with what it loves allied! How well doth for his trusting broods The Spirit of the Lake provide!” With startled glance their heads they raise, One movement quick from side to side, Then far into the dimness sail With shrill wild cry and dripping trail. As each into the still air dashes, Its level-flapping wing-tips make Upon the else unruffled Lake A double row of silver splashes Spurting a moment in its wake. She smiles: “Ah, had I wings like you, Could be so soon love-nestled too!— Dread Spirit! help me too as well, Whom no irreverent thoughts compel Unwillingly to break the spell Of Silence lone wherein you dwell!” II. Lightly along her liquid path she presses; Nor yet the toil her buoyant frame distresses. Anon, as patiently she sped, There came as of itself into her head An old and simple lay, She oft had sung in many a happier day, About a maid her home for love forsaking; And the recurring rhythm making The effort of volition less, And so preventing weariness,— Though scarce a meaning to its phrases linking— She kept into her spirit drinking The metre's chime—a kind of rest from thinking; And steadily aside the crystal waters flinging, Kept murmuring the old rhyme in time—she had no breath for singing:— 1. “The freshet is flowing, But growing quite clear; The full river flashes And gurgles and dashes With tinklings and plashes How pleasant to hear! The tiny bright billows That lately were whirling So turbid and dun, Are playfully curling, And merrily glance as they dance in the Sun!— To the current confiding My little canoe, See! joyously gliding My course I pursue. Look! carelessly twirling The paddle I sit, The river deciding Which way we shall flit: I sit all alone, No fear have I, none! For I know to what quarter its waters will run! 2. “And see how, while speeding, A Maiden unheeding, Wherever those curling Crisp billows are leading,— Never raising a mast or The light sail unfurling, But leaving my boat free to float as it will; The rich breeze comes after To waft her the faster, The faster to waft her To where out of sight Stands a cottage so bright; (Ah well do I know it, Rush-wall and red rafter And carvings so gay!) Which oft far away I have watched half the day, When the sunbeam would show it One spot of red light Beneath the deep-glooming, far-looming blue hill. 3. “No obstacles stay me, No dangers delay me! The streams,—where the river In summer dividing In silvery threads, Slips hurriedly gliding O'er glittering beds Of shingle,—all mingled, you nowhere can see! All the rapids wherever The water ran creaming, And, flashing and gleaming From humps and from shoulders Of obstinate boulders, Snow-tassels offstreaming Would flutter and quiver,— They have vanished—replenished to let me go free! And the broad yellow spaces Where lost were all traces Of the creaming, the flashing, The streaming, the dashing, The stir and the strife; Where you heard not a murmur, No chatter or churme or Low musical plaint; Where the gravel-beds wholly Concealing it, slowly The river went oozing Beneath, and gave life To a few dainty bosses Of pallid gray mosses, Such fragrance diffusing Delicious and faint;— They are gone—they have vanished—all banished for me! 4. “The ranks of green rushes With their brown knobs of down, Where the stream's overflow Creeps dimpling and slow, How gentle their stirring As softly conferring They murmur so low! In a moment 'tis done; They are still every one! As they stand in a row And watch me, I know Why it is they are so; I know each green lisper Fears even a whisper May show where I go, who the rover must be! And the louder flax-bushes With their crowding and crossing Black stems darkly studded With blossoms red-blooded— Their long blades are tossing As the breeze comes up quicker (So wantonly spilling The honeysweet liquor Their ruddy cups filling);— Hark! pattering, playing, They rustle in glee; And I fancy them saying: ‘O fondly, O fleetly She flies—never heed her, For Love is her leader; And fairly and featly He steers, who but he! Then mind her not—hinder not—let her go free!’— And brighter and higher, Like flames of pale fire, The great plumes far and wide Of the sword-grass aspire; In their grace and their pride They are all on my side! See! feather to feather How bending together They seem to try whether My flight they may hide; ‘We know to what meeting, How blissful a greeting The runaway fleeting So fondly would glide;— Droop thickly—wave quickly—that no one may see!’ 5. “Then, Father, why chide her, Your darling, your pride, or Lament at her going Whatever betide her! For though your eyes glisten, O how can she listen— To such a fond lover the rover has flown! Unavailing the wailing, And idle to chide her, When breezes freshblowing, When waters quickflowing, All fair things upgrowing And waving beside her, Will but guide and confide her to one heart alone!” Thus, not without a sense forlorn and dreary How doubtful her own flight and fate Beside that maiden's, speeding to her mate With answered love and confidence elate, Poor Amohia swims till she is weary. III. A welcome rest! Above the surface, see, Projects the stump of a long-sunken tree: Last remnant of a forest-giant That once with outflung arms defiant, With all his green fraternity Stood shouldering out the dappled sky On this same spot, and shed around Noon-twilights where in leafy shade The golden tremors sparely played; Or in the echoing hush profound At intervals the soft quick beats Of the wild-pigeon's winnowing wing, Subsiding whisper-like, betrayed Where high up in his green retreats, He flitted leisurely at feed.— The mighty forest like a weed Has withered—vanished like a dream! The sky is bare, and everywhere Above you spreads the empty air, Around the lonely waters gleam: Where insects burrowed, hummed and swarmed The wildfowl dips; and, unalarmed, In silvery shoals the minnows stream, Their thousands moving with one will; Or, lying motionless and still On tiny fins self-balancing, Like spreading arrows shoot away If any swimming Maiden may Perchance their crystal-folded slumbers fray. Such wondrous change can compassed be By Ru, the Earthquake-God's decree, Who lifts and lowers the groaning land As in the hollow of his hand. To this old timeworn stump unsought Her slightly devious course had brought The unconscious Maid, direct and true, So that perforce it was descried. She found a footing on its side, And as a long deep breath she drew, And firm her panting bosom prest The filmy weeds that o'er it grew Light green, and dangling rose and fell, Listless in the lapping swell Her swimming left,—her arms she threw Around it, grateful for the timely rest. Spontaneous gratefulness—to whom and why? Wondrous, with no one to be grateful to, That thus the natural heart should ever fly, Thus gravitate, as 'twere, if left alone, To something all unseen, unknown: That its perennial lights, intense or dwindling, To bold clear Love and Adoration kindling, Or dimly down to Fetish fear declining, Keep pointing to a polestar—nowhere shining! You pity her—untaught and rude To know how blind such gratitude; Who threw away vain thanks because Her own proceedings and intent Just then fell out coincident With the fixed working of cast-iron laws; And so o'erlooked in ignorance That principle to minds profound So much more rational and sound, Her real benefactor—Chance! IV. But right the sentiment or wrong, It was not one to hold her long. To her deserted Father flew Her thoughts—his anguish when her clothes they found: What if his Child, his grey hair's pride were drowned! Her loss how would he brood upon and rue; With dim eyes, in the sleepy old canoe, With pole and hoopnet as he used to do, Fishing perhaps the long day through; Unconscious half, in his distress And heedless of his ill-success. To think of his despair her bosom bled; Yet how could they upbraid her that she fled? Could they, if all were known, bid her contend Against a fate she could not help nor mend? Was Love to be resisted? Could they blame her If that insidious Power o'ercame her? Because they could not see nor feel The spell whose tyrannous control Absorbed, entranced her mind—her soul, Should they expect she could reject Its might, her heart against it steel? As well—(for as her feelings rose, The oriental fancy, bred And born with her, and through all joys and woes With metaphor and song for ever fed, At once in quick spontaneous chaunt Expressing all the moment's want, Again to Nature's ways and shows For vindication and example sped) As well upbraid the feathery clouds of Morning, Because the unrisen Sun is out of sight, For not in cold impassive pallor scorning The first faint touches of his cheering light; As well expect their snowy fleeces, As upward from his seahid cave he rushes, Not to be heart-struck into burning blushes; Or as he nigher comes and nigher And the soft-flowing splendour still increases, Though all his disc be hidden yet, As well expect the basking brood No further to drink-in the blissful flood, But fling it eddying back, nor let The rosy blushes rapture-kindle into golden fire! “Ah no!” she thought, while her full bosom heaves A sigh—“with me no more than these—Ah no, It cannot be—it never can be so! Him I was born, compelled to love—I know; Him I shall love—him ever—till the day When with thick coronals of freshest leaves The maids and matrons to my funeral go!”— In fresh resolve the passing pang she smothers, And dashes, as it starts, the tear away: Then with a half impatience and mute pain She turns into the yielding Lake again; Again the Lake's mild breast receives her like a Mother's! Canto the Third. The Star-lit Swimming. 1. Amo swimming still. 2. The Starry Heavens. What ideas natural to the vision she missed; 3. And what resultant feelings. Adoration higher than Logic? 4, 5. What she did see and feel. 6. Exhaustion. 7. Land. 8. A warm bath. I. Swim, Amohia, swim!—with patient toil she swims, In solemn silence, night, and loneliness. Steady the star-reflections, every flake Like dropping arrows, golden, motionless, Hang on the shadowy polish of the Lake; Only the waving of her lithe young limbs Sets them a little trembling, or bedims And quenches them, as through their glittering trails she swims. Once more the Maiden's vigour flags; Wearily now her languid frame she drags; So on her back to rest her arms she turns, And with her feet alone the water slowly spurns. II. But when at once right o'er her swung The whole enormous lighted dome of Heaven, What feelings in her bosom sprung?— Not fraught indeed for her the glorious vision With all the myriad miracles 'tis given Our tutored sight to marvel at therein; Thickstarred Immensities—O what were fields Elysian— Softswarded glooms of Paradise Fire-streaked with glancing lovelit eyes; Or that pure Empyrean where the bards divine— Of Albion or the Florentine, In world-entrancing everliving dreams, Saw jacinth-downs and topaz-spurting streams And uplands opaline; Champaigns of sheeted pearl with rosy-green Reflections shot, and mildest rainbow-sheen, Where snowdrifts of blest Angels spread and swarm And scatter, on the rolling grand Hosanna-storm Uplifted—floated—borne away! Or rounded to a snowy world-wide rose With golden heart where God's own brilliance glows;— What seem all these to that tremendous scene, But tinselled stagework—transient—mean— Poor craft of some mere mortal mechanician! —Nor could her fancy science-guided stray— From those bold fires that here and there Like vanward sentinels low hovering hung, Rejoicing in some kingly trust,— Through an immeasurable array Of evervarying mingling lights Pausing in multitudinous troops On still retiring higher heights As on some vast celestial palace-stair; Or poured forth infinite in scattering groups And endlessly-recurring shoal on shoal; With luminous depths on all sides leading To deeper depths that evermore receding And evermore reopening lose Themselves in labyrinthine avenues Of glory unspeakable! a maze Of vistas intricate that everywhere Away and upward roll Into a dimness splendid with a dust Of Suns—a gleaming haze, A visible shining cloud Of specks invisible—all worlds—and all avowed Only a handbreadth of the outstanding Whole! O not for her the eternal flood Of worlds in bloom and worlds in bud; The lightning-speeded cataract of Creation Boundless and bounding on for ever; Chaotic mass or cosmic—brood on brood Evolving, intermitting never, To dash and daze the strongest-winged imagination! Full many a sun-thronged Universe that dwindles To a tiny film of light, So far off in the Infinite! Full many a flying Ocean of bright Mist that kindles At its deep core eddy-curled And whirls and thickens to a world; Or at its vasty margin thinning Drops lagging vapour-belts and luminous rings That shrink apart, like breaking strings Of jewels, into moons and satellites, Fresh-starting on their separate flights, And on new centres spinning! —The trailing spawn of Systems vapour-tangled; And seeded masses of stargrain like roes Of fishes, so the congregated clusters close— Ay, golden ovaries of great globes in myriads—all By distance inconceivable comprest Into the semblance of a swarming ball Of pin's-head spiders in their whitewebbed nest:— —The swallow-swoop of Comets as they flee In the wild race of revelry; Each like some mad enamoured Bayadere That darts from out the throng to where Sits in full-diamonded pride Her mighty Rajah awful-eyed, As if, athirst for his caresses, To fling herself upon his blazing breast; But catching as she comes anear The kingly-chilling glitter of his glance, Swerves off abashed in full career Again into the reeling dance! So, down upon their Sun-God dashing With sudden shift these couriers swift Still scour away into Infinitude—off-flashing With all their hundred million leagues of luminous tresses Into the fathomless abysses To make amid the astonished spheres Their sportive circuit of a thousand years! Or say, 'twere but the wake they trace Lashing to foam-light as they race Quiescent force asleep in space— Still—still they spurn all resting-place!— —Then all the sensitive Planets as they float, In their enormous solitudes Troubled mysteriously—the changeful moods Reflecting of their kindred most remote; So delicately alive to and returning Each faint and far off sister's finest yearning; In their elastic orbits wheeling Eternal rounds of sympathetic feeling.— III. Not these—not all the vast sublimities that lurk Within the visible sphere—the o'erpowering whole Disclosed by the optic tube that dares to thrust The flaming portals wide asunder And show the great Enigma at its secret work So silent—boundless—beautiful, it strikes the Soul Into hushed tears of awe and ecstasy and wonder! Yet fires it with impatient thirst to be Knit somehow nearer, In vision clearer, Communion dearer With the impenetrable mute Mystery That flings such glories freely all around us Unsoundable by such a mite as Man; And yet has left them ours, And us with partial powers The mighty surface of the work to scan And apprehend—not comprehend—a plan; And feel they need not utterly confound us, Nor lay us under ‘Matter's’ loathly ban; Nor by ‘Necessity's’ cold confines bound us!— For shut out from the eyes of wiser Sense That palpable Omnipotence, And in the flashing face of it descend To doughtiness of reasoning—where will end Your task—to what conviction tend? Will not the dominance of Law all through And prescient purpose—still accomplished too— Pronounce in spite of analytic brawl One Will—one conscious Mind—the cause of all? Or call it Force, self-causing—if you will— 'Tis Force that infinitely varying, still Through myriad myriad evolutions ranges; Into a million simultaneous streams divides; At once through all without confusion glides; And keeps their mystic momentary changes Springing in mutual fitness forth—agreeing As each the fresh results of all foreseeing:— What powers has Mind such Force does not possess— What knowledge proper to self-consciousness?— But say your reasoning never can extract From that transcendent overwhelming revelation Some finite supernatural spirit-fact That bows and shrinks to petty ‘demonstration,’ And so defies all Logic's undermining,— Take the completest human Being, combining With Reason—Reverence and Imagination— Of Intellect and Feeling all compact; On him how likeliest will it ever act?— Will it not launch on such a Soul a flood Of irresistible uplifting inspiration That spurns at slow deductions, wrong or right, Too poor for consciousness so vast?—not smite Into that ampler Soul a rapture bright Of awe and adoration and delight, And leave for its ecstatic mood No outlet, no expression, no relief, But in one grand conception in whose blaze Poor Logic withers with her creeping ways; And stands confessed an attribute Lower and likelier for the brute, For things that crawl and things that plod,— But in one blinding Truth and chief Of Truths—ne'er to be fathomed—ne'er defined—the feeling, God! IV. Well—though there rose not to the Maiden's mind Such visions with such thoughts entwined, She could not fail Awestruck to mark how vast a bed Of brilliants was above her spread, As 'twere the sediment and golden grail By some great Sea of upper Light deposited: Nor all the finer showers of gems that far away Fused into fainter light-wreaths lay Marbling the mournful depths of solemn blue: Nor how across it all meandering wide Went a pale, luminous smoke that swarmed With sparks, as from the unseen fires it rose Of some vast spectral beings that performed Their unimaginable rites outside: She wondered too At those mysterious stains of darkest hue, Unfathomable shafts of blindest vacancy Like scathing tracks of Demon dread Before whose flight the myriad brilliances Shrank blighted—marred—as shrink and close Rock-purpling tribes of sea-anemones Beneath the careless tread Of one who by the side of Ocean goes. But shunning all that glorious Company A falling star—look! swift and furtively Slides into light a moment, and is gone! Of all unnoted, noting none; In stealthy chase (she thought) or bent On secret mission—but apart, alone— And utterly absorbed in his unknown intent. All was so solemn, vast, ethereal, strange— Complete within its wondrous self—removed So far from our dark world of chance and change, From all she hoped, or feared, or loved, The longer on the scene she dwelt, More helpless still the maiden felt, More feeble, specklike, in the gleaming dumb Immensity. V. What, though she had been taught to trace Amid the million throbbing hearts of fire, Ancestral spirits of her race Whose fame had won them that high place,— Those steady stars, unwinking, bold, That well might souls of heroes be, From them, so proud, and calm, and cold How could she look for sympathy? But where were they, so gentle, clear, Sweet innocent spirits in timid lustres shrined, Whom oft at twilight she would mark Come trembling through the melting dark, As then, then only confident enough (Like fawns upon the point to turn and fly) With fluttering heart to hesitate so nigh?— They must be, sure, of tenderer stuff,— Have souls that pity could inspire! Ah, idle seemed the fond desire Amid the thronging hosts to find One kindred heart from whom a Maid Might look for love or hope for any aid! For if her glance for many moments rested On any single group of all that sprinkled The skies, the fancy then her brain infested, They were tall radiant Figures downward peering From shining strongholds, high and free And safe above her, while behind them leering Still more and more kept crowding in to see, With eyes that with malicious pleasure twinkled At her poor puny efforts. And her guide, Her pilot star could be no more descried; So by the glorious vision more deprest Than strengthened by the partial rest, She turns again, And plies her weary shoulders with increasing pain. Poor outworn Amohia!—world-abandoned Maid, Thy brave strong heart is now thine only aid! VI. “Ah! if at last I sink—” It blanched her cheek to think The thought—her heart a moment ceased to beat— “Oh might I then on that dear shore be thrown And by Ranóro found alone! And if he loved me with a love like mine Ah, would not even then my bosom own Some feeble flutter of a joy divine When frantic he would clasp, the cold, cold form With vain caresses warm; No love returned, no answering heat; Then curse the intolerable light—nor stay— But dashing out his life in some quick way While the loathed Universe whirled off his brain, With fainting fervour strain Our dead and dying hearts together—never to part again! But if, as once I think you said,— Laughing at what I told you of the gloom And sordid horror of our Reinga dread— The white man hopes a better doom For spirits of the dead, Oh would not mine low hovering for a while, Linger for yours, Ranoro! Then, O bliss! to speed Together to that happier land— For they would rush together freed, And wondering with a pensive happy smile At all the maddening care and heed That vexed the senseless forms entwined upon the strand. Nay, live, Ranoro! live—and sometimes give A thought to your poor—lost—” The bitter tear Was checked before it reached her eyes; And that throat-agony forbid to rise: With resolute will She bids the unnerving visions disappear; And the brave Maiden tries To rally her spent force with thoughts of meeting, With the deep rapture of Ranoro's greeting. Alas, though feebly struggling still With patient anguish on her brow, Poor gallant Amohia is exhausted now! VII. But see! upon the hillside glows, Unmoving, bright, a sudden light! Oh joyous sight, 'tis his, she knows! New hope, new life, new strength she gains; It feeds her brain with will—with warmth her veins. And now she is aware how on the right A mountain spur, as if in friendly guise Has stolen forward to surprise And catch—say rather, to embrace her! How high the hills that darkly face her Have grown! the darkly-branching trees Are mingling with the stars, she sees: A kind of gentle stir is in the air; Faint sounds of life, though life at rest, are there.— Like an accordion suddenly Opened and shut by some one nigh, Two loud harsh notes assail her ear— The night-hawk's! harsh but yet so near! She blest them! to her present plight Seemed never song-bird's notes so dear, So sweet as that melodious screech Startling the darkness with delight! With desperate strokes she presses forward fast— She feels that they must be her last. With downthrust foot she strives to reach— O joy—O bliss!—she feels for and has found, Can touch that deep salvation—the firm ground! One stroke—one other yet—a moment more She staggers, falls—upon the pumice-whitened shore. VIII. Cold, shivering, stiff,—with drooping eyes, Slow-beating pulse and gasping sighs Long prostrate on the ground she lies. 'Twas the night-chill those Lakes have, ev'n in summer, More than the distance, that had so o'ercome her.— But gleaming in the Moon's new-risen beam She sees not far a little puff of steam; She struggles towards it slowly—half-alive; That lucky spring will soon her languid frame revive! It was a sparry basin, smoothly lipped and fringed With snowy stalactite, just tinged With a faint delicate flush Like that white rose, the ‘maiden-blush.’ The water seemed a liquid piece of heaven—so blue— Of midmost heaven a lonely piece Laid bare by a slight breach in the summer-fleece; And look what sparkling crowds of bubbles through Diaphonous azure, fast and ever Escaping in the fountain's fever Are trembling up with timorous haste to greet And deck with diamond grail the beauteous guest, As down she sinks into her lucid seat And in transparent sapphire makes her warm and liquid nest. Canto the Fourth. Legends of the Spirit-Land. 1. Ranolf meanwhile at his hut listens to legends. 2. Patito coming from, and (3) Maui descending to, the Land of Spirits. 4. Ranolf fancies the Realm of Ru, the Earthquake-God. 5. Maui's ill-luck. 6. These myths sprung from Man's hatred of death. I. That evening, with a feeling half forlorn, With him unusual, Ranolf musing sate, And listened listless to his followers' chat. It was the hour for sleep; but though outworn With hunting, now with reckless zest pursued In his unsatisfied and restless mood, Little for slumber felt the youth disposed. Outside their hut beneath the stars reclined, Or pacing to and fro, he let the Night— Its soft black-brooding Spirit-wings outspread, Its myriad-winking eyes of mystic light Exulting in their secret undisclosed— Sink down into and soothe his working mind: “It was so still and breathless,” as he said, “You almost heard the stars throb.” One by one His comrades to their mats retired to rest; Till Táreha was with Ranolf left alone, Who at a legend all his tribe outshone:— Of many, this was one he told his guest: II. 1 “Mutára's fame filled all the land; what foeman but would fear The crashing of his battle-brand—the whirlwind of his spear! One dread opprest his haughty breast, lest he should die at last And leave a name some Warrior's fame among the dead surpassed. 2 Far as the Reinga's self erelong—down to those very dead, Like flames in fern when winds are strong, his widening glory spread; His sire Patito's heart grew dark; beneath his gloomy frown His eyes' grim ire flashed lurid fire, to hear of such renown. 3 One eve Mutara chafing strode along the Ocean shore, While flew the Tempest all abroad—for Peace his heart-strings tore: Blood-tinged with Sunset struggling through black Storm-clouds branching free, Came roaring in with splashing din, the boiling hissing Sea! 4 Wind-swept, a waft of sea-birds white went scattering up the sky, As storm-opprest to rocky rest they staggering strove to fly; For scouring wide, the hollow winds rushed frantic in despair, And spray-wreaths grand and wreaths of sand tossed their wild arms in air. 5 With firmer foot and dinted heel Mutara onward went, And clenched his teeth with rage to feel so baffled and besprent. “Oh, could you take,” he muttered deep, “here, now, a human form, Soon would we see who'd Master be, O blustering, bullying Storm!” 6 Scarce was the reckless challenge given, before with tenfold wrath The furious frenzied gusts were driven across his difficult path; As round him thick fly sands and spray, a Figure looming large Seems in the drift approaching swift the Challenger to charge. 7 Two lightning gleams shoot through the gloom—O horror! he descries Fierce-flashing through the whirling clouds, his Father's spectral eyes! The frantic winds with hollow scream seem sounding in his ear, “There, boaster, there! see if you dare abide your Father's spear!” 8 Aghast—amazed—yet still he raised his lance and forward leapt; But o'er him black the maddening rack of the whole Tempest swept; And down the eddying wind hoarse shrieks of laughter rolled in scorn, As he was left of sense bereft, stretched on the sands forlorn. 9 They found—revived him—sung his praise—the One who with the Dead Alone had dared to fight unscared! and all our Elders said That had Mutara won the day on that tempestuous shore, The Reinga's power and Death's dark hour had conquer'd Man no more.—” “Death conquer Man no more!—but how succeed In conquering him!” said Ranolf; “Strike him low But once, that were the feat of feats indeed! But had you never hero could o'erthrow That bugbear—beat that universal Foe?” “Well, Maui tried it, long enough ago:— III. “You have heard, have you not, of great Maui? how he Lay at first on the flat rocky reefs of the sea, In that land of our fathers, Hawaiki the blest, 'Mid the vast ropes of weed that in endless unrest Crawl, welter and toss on that surf-snowy plain, Serpentining in long undulations of pain, And glistening black, as they writhe in the tide; Or if haply their monstrous contortions subside, Still uneasily stirring in comfortless bed; They are tresses, they say, that Taranga outspread Round the Infant she left on the sea-shore and fled:— But those tangles, they dandled in sunshine and storm, And nurtured and kneaded the Babe into form. Then scathless to keep him from sea-bird and worm, The jelly-fish wrapt him all fresh from the brine In their discs of soft crystal, that streaked with such fine Radiations of scarlet transparently shine. So he grew up a Giant; and gave his great days To glorious deeds and the winning of praise. The red seeds of fire he was first to discover; And dared in his longing for light to lean over The mountainous walls of the uttermost West, The Sun in his headlong career to arrest: There in spite of his fast-flashing struggles, he noosed The far-darting limbs of that Lustre; reduced The perilous speed of his ruinous race To a steady, majestic and orderly pace; And compelled him in warmth and mild splendour to steep The Isles Maui's hook had first fished from the Deep. But how small was the worth of his glory and power, While the monster, black Death, could all Being devour; And Man who elsewhere could such victories gain, Of his villainous maw must the victim remain!— No, if He were unconquered, all conquests were vain. Now Maui had seen how the Sun every night Sunk wearied and worn from his sky-cresting height; While a legion of Clouds oft exultingly stood, Like a crowd of base foemen all stained with his blood, O'er the dying great Chief as he sunk in the flood: Yet the Hero next morning, revived and renewed, Rose in glory again and his journey pursued. It was down, then, beneath the deep Sea and this Earth He was steeped in fresh vigour, endowed with new birth.— Might not Maui descend to this Life-spring and bathe In its waters, and shake off the scorn and the scathe Of this tyrant, this Death, and delighted reswathe His limbs in the glory and gladness of youth In those mystical depths?—He would try it, in sooth!— But, to find where those springs of vitality flow In what ultimate gulfs and abysses below! Could it be where the Mountains' foundations are laid In the realm of red Ru, or the Reinga's deep shade?—” IV. “The realm of Ru—the Earthquake-God! More awful realm, i' faith, than e'er was trod By jinn or gnome must Ru's have been!” Cried Ranolf—“fancy what a scene!— What bellowing Caverns measureless and dread— With rents in thunder running overhead! Far-seen through low-browed arches glimmering red, A Sea perpetual agitation frets and churns To foam, that luridly illumined burns! Then wide and wider yawn the branching rents That through the black impending granite spread; And lo! the vast Abyss hurled upward vents A maddening chaos of all elements— An infinite ruin of red fire And flying rocks fire-molten—tumult dire Of roaring steam and sulphurous blasts and lava seas And forests of upshooting flame and tower-trunked trees Of pitchy cloud and sky-hung cinderous canopies— All the fire-entrails of that cavernous pit Whirled upwards through one vast volcano-rift!— 'Tis Ru! 'tis Ru! with red wild eyes, And blazing far-coruscant hair, And frowns that blacken half their glare, Outrushing from his burning lair Into a realm for his disporting fit!— For see! whene'er the hurricane-drift Of heaven-outblotting ashes swift Breaks off, the ensanguined dome of cloud Seems shattered, frittered to a crowd Of fragments small of uniform shape and size, As by some shock that ran at once through all The shivering Earth and shuddering skies! See! far and near—see! great and small His band awakening at his call! How their volcano-fires appal! Here, white, intense and awful and half-hid By upheaved strata, lifted like the lid Of some enormous, black half-opened tomb Within whose jaws condensed it glows self-fanned:— There, shot up silent—sudden—athwart the gloom, Pillars of ruddy light unmoving stand! And many a sheaf of vivid flame up-showers, Crested with scarlet flowers Of red-hot scoria:—level stripes of gold Afar in lakes the Lava sleeps, Or like a swarm of deadly serpents creeps, Or down the shaking mountain-steeps Dashes in crimson cataracts uncontrolled: And peaks and pinnacles and ridges bold In fluctuation terrible are rolled, And rise and sink like sea-waves; underground A deadened roar goes on for ever with a sound As if a hundred Giants waking would have risen, But bumped and thumped their heads against the roof Of their too-cramping subterranean prison! A world's artillery crashes near—aloof Reverberating thunders rumble round The mountain-filled horizon!—But I stay Your story—let us hear how Maui found Down to those life-springs his adventurous way!” V. “Well, Maui resolved to descend to the womb Of original Night—to the kingdom of gloom; For 'twas there that this water, these life-springs must flow; And its mouth is beneath the dark tide, as you know, In the uttermost North, at the end of the land, Where a rocky long causeway of pinnacles grand Breaks off mid the waves' ever-restless commotion Far away in the lonely and limitless Ocean. So direct to the mouth of that darksome abode O'er the mountains from summit to summit he strode; And his legs as he stalked on his wonderful way, Caught sight of beneath the broad cloud-skirts of gray, Might have seemed the dim rays, wide aslant, which the Sun Flings beneath him sometimes ere his bright course be run; And his Form when full-seen, swept toweringly by, Reared aloft like the waterspout whirling on high In a dark-waving column from Ocean to Sky. So he strode through the clouds to the terrible pass. Then, although his vast might had availed, in a mass To uplift from the Sea the whole rocky-backed Cape— (As blue in bright distance, long headlands will gape On a sleek summer morning, warped up from the main, Like the snout of some monster, just raised from the plain As he listlessly crawls in slow length from his lair, And pauses a moment to sniff the cool air) Yet determined its natural terrors to dare, Or fearing the road so subverted to miss, Head foremost he plunged down the pitchblack abyss. But when great Mother Night, Hínë-Nui-te-Po, Perceived her inviolate regions below So profaned, a deep shudder of horror and dread, Through the cavernous realms of the shadowy Dead, Round their sombre and silent circumference ran; That was just as bold Maui his passage began:— But when still he persists in his daring endeavour The shudders, the horrors grow wilder than ever! A more terrible spasm, a desperate shock Contracts and convulses those portals of rock; And ere his great head and vast shoulders get through They cut the gigantic Intruder in two!— So ended great Maui—so vanished his dream, And in spite of him Death was left tyrant supreme!” VI. “Well, these are genuine Myths at last,” Thought Ranolf, “samples from the Past Of modes men caught at to record Notions for which they had no word; So clothed, unable to abstract, Emotions deep in fancied fact; To else unutterable thought Imaginative utterance brought. These myths expressed (to souls—untaught Thought from some Mind that thought—to part, And feeling from some feeling Heart), How futile every effort still To fathom Death's mysterious ill; How of all phantoms of Despair Frowns one, no noble heart can bear, A ghastly horror, nothing less, Beyond relief, without redress, The Nightmare of pure Nothingness: How hateful, spite of all endeavour, How utterly repugnant ever, No tongue can tell to what degree, It is to Being not to Be. Aye! none the less for that mad scheme, The Buddhists' nihilistic dream, Spurned by the masses wholly,—since Ev'n he—its life-sick Founder-Prince, (If e'er the tenet was his own, Not Kás-yapa his friend's alone) Was forced in self-despite to teach, A million ages' high persistence In virtue must elapse, ere each Or any could attain—evince Capacity for non-existence— Mere power of soul-extinction reach. These wiser Savages at least were true To one grand Instinct—somehow felt and knew Nothing but conscious individual life— No ‘mingling with the visible Universe’ Or ‘painless sleep for ever’—worse than pain— Will satisfy the everlasting strife That must be waged without it; what a curse, A mockery this Existence (if no worse) Did future Nothingness for Man remain; The highest feelings, then, he can attain, The best delights, but traps and lures would be To cheat him into madder misery.” Canto the Fifth. Amohia at the Fountain. 1. A child from the hut goes for water to the fountain. 2. Amo hiding sings a song. 3. Its meaning. 4. Child, frightened, reports a Native ‘Fairy’ at the well. 5. Ranolf goes out to see, musing on ‘Spirits.’ I. The night wore on; his friends were gone; Still Ranolf paced and mused alone. It chanced, a little lad who slept In his men's hut that evening—come For change' sake from his neighbouring home— Felt thirsty; from his mattings crept, The yellow calabash to find, Which, hollowed out, a hardened rind, Was mostly full of water kept. 'Twas empty: looking out, “'Tis light (He thought) almost as day:”—so quite Forgot his native fear of Night, And to the spring beneath the hill Set off his calabash to fill. II. The spring was close beside the path To that quick-bubbling crystal bath Where Amohia rested; she Could in the moonlit distance see The cot and its karaka-tree, And Ranolf now emerge, so clear, Now in its shadow disappear. And she had marked the little lad Set off her way with heart how glad; And when he neared her bright retreat, That heart with high expectance beat. Hard-by there grew in snowy bloom Thickets of aromatic broom; Within whose green impervious screen, Stand but a yard, she ne'er were seen. Into the copse she quickly slipped, Three steps from where the fountain dripped. There, breathless, stirless, on the watch, She formed her little scheme—until The thirsty lad had drunk his fill, And held his calabash to catch The water of the trickling spring. Then in a warbling voice, low sweet and wild, That intertwined with its harmonious plash, The hidden Girl began to sing A ditty to the startled Child About a “fountain” and “a calabash:” 1. “Golden water! golden water! Flowing freely, flowing ever, Flowing since the World began; What shall we pour it in— Heedfully store it in?— If your calabash be not quite clean—if any foulness begrime or besmutch it, Oh you never will catch the clear rillet—it will shrink away as you touch it! 2. “Golden water! golden water! Flowing coyly, dried up never Since Tumátau moulded Man; Flowing so tamelessly, Seeming so aimlessly!— Would you catch it with hands unsteady, or a heart with passion fretted? Would you guide it in spouts of flax-leaf as you please?—Oh, you'll only get wetted!”— The Child, at first too terrified Even to run away, stood there Holding the calabash in air, With cheeks all blanched—mouth gaping wide, And eyes outstarting; reassured A little now, he seemed to gain Some heart to list the simple strain; But 'twas the voice that most allured, And most his confidence secured. Had not the Maid been ever known And loved for that melodious tone? And was it not at birth instilled, That voice like Music? when they killed In numbers at her name-day feast, The Korimáko, sweetest bird Of all that are in forest heard? That so, with prayers of chanting priest, The spirit of their sweetness might Upon the happy Child alight, And her maturing accents be Unmatched for kindred melody?— So, doubtful if to run or stay, He stood—while she resumed her lay: 3. “Crystal water! crystal water! Glistening out, then disappearing; Blinding those who wink and blink: How to get near it, then?— Forward, ne'er fear it, then! Sharp eye and free step—no crawling or creeping sideways like a shellfish— All else like an innocent Child—confiding—straightforward—unselfish! 4. “Crystal water! crystal water! Chilling often, often cheering, Numbing those who cease to drink: How can we use it well?— Drink and diffuse it well! If in finely carved cisterns you try to enclose it securely— Tiny monsters will breed there and wriggle—it will stagnate impurely. 5. “Diamond water! diamond water! Warbling to all tribes and ages, Welling near us yet apart: Who is it guards it so? Watches and wards it so?— If you fear any Spirit too much, you'll ne'er see it though flowing close by you— But revere you no Spirit at all?—what you drink will but petrify you. 6. “Diamond water! diamond water! With still, lucent eye of Sages, But with Childhood's open heart; So may you light on it, Thrive and grow bright on it!”— Here Amohia from the thicket springing Whisked from his hand the flask it clung to, singing. “Though your calabash be battered, bruised,—yet fear not you to fill it,— For the better 'twill hold, the fresher keep, this flitting, magical rillet.” III. —This was a song, in fact, by Ranolf made And turned to Maori to assay His skill, and see how far would reach Or be constrained, the native speech; When sport was slack one summer day, As ambushed in tall reeds he lay Just in the wary wild-duck's way;— While thinking by what wonder it befel, And with what natural supernatural aid, The mighty Stream—the fluent race of Man, Since first its mystic course began, Even while in foam and turbulence it ran Adown those ancient faintly-glimmering slopes, The shadowy-lit Himálayas of old Time, Had still been fed from age to age With springs of Spiritual Truth sublime; Rillets and runnels of immortal Hopes: Some crystal Soul of saint or sage For the great river timeously supplied; Slipping, as 'twere, from any side, Into its clouded and tumultuous tide:— And how above, around us, and below Those myriad-branching rivulets may flow Capriciously, it seems, yet ever feeding The heart of Man when most 'tis needing:— Then all the evil that proceeds From dams and dykes of narrow Creeds;— Last how to enter that coy shadowy ground, And the pure runnel's bright arrival wait; Or in what spirit penetrate Up to the airhung crevices of snow, Or thicket-stifled gorges, dense, profound, Where those divinest Wellsprings may abound.— Well, but this Song, a glimpse, a hint, An impress from Reflection's mint Struck faintly of a theme so vast— Of a wide bee-eyed truth one tiny facet With nothing but simplicity to grace it— The fancy of the native girls had caught (Who only of its literal meaning thought) And Amohia's self had reached at last. IV. But that slight gesture of the Maid Which tossed the calabash away, Renewed the fears her song allayed; No gift had bribed the Child to stay. To Ranolf's side he scampered back Aghast, agape with fright—Alack! There was a Spirit at the well, A Pátu-páere! he could tell That voice so sweet—that form so fair, Those eyes, with such a dancing glare!— Rebuked, cross-questioned, coaxed or jeered, Still to his tale the lad adhered. So Ranolf, as he could not sleep, And must perforce a vigil keep, Strolled to the Spring himself to see What might this wondrous Spirit be. V. “Spirits—still Spirits!—strange that every race Of Man,” thought Ranolf as he went, “Still on that fixed idea is bent, That in some fashion, form, or place, Spirit without Matter can and does exist: Yet to its source whene'er we trace Some record of its presence, sent Without a bodily environment, The ‘proof’ (so-called) is always missed. What then?—Is Matter's self much better off? Prove its appearance unallied With Spirit, if you can. Sure, Reason's pride Should spurn the refuge of a scoff, When Matter's very being is denied, And bring us proof. Probe Matter to the last, Nothing but active Spirit will be found: Aye, all we see and hear, the glorious round Of our sensations has no other ground; Only their sequence stands so fixed and fast; In such unchanged alliance are they passed Before us by the Master-Showman's hand.— All Ghosts and Apparitions here we stand! And for your vulgar ‘Ghosts’ indeed 'Tis breach of sequence only that we need Produce—no more; prove shadows may succeed Each other in a series yet to law Unknown; find but a single certain flaw Or falter in the dream-procession grand. An easy task, 'twould seem! And yet 'tis true 'Tis that—that merely—there are none can do!” Canto the Sixth. Silence and Moonlight. 1. Ranolf can find no one. Silence. Moonlight. 2. A lizard and a mantis watching. 3. Sudden sense of the phenomenal character of things visible, and consciousness of the Spiritual and Real. 4. What is this Soul in Nature?—5. Returning, his hand touched. 6. A vision. I. So Ranolf musing, down the hill Had sauntered to the trickling rill. There, all save its low plash was still; Only a movement caught his eye Scarce visible, as he drew nigh The thicket dense that grew thereby; Only a bough's-top in the brake Did for a single moment shake. He pushed straight towards it through the broom; But finding nothing in the gloom, Came out upon the open Lake. Still all was lonely—silent—bright; Only himself and living light!— He followed where the pathway wound Beneath the cliffs, with many a turn Round buttressed steep, projecting mound, And waterscarped low spur tree-crowned, Or rocky—bare of bush or fern. One of these last he just had passed:— Beyond it lay in deepest shade A dense ravine's mouth, which had made With clustered shrubs a safe retreat For foemen of pursuit afraid. He paused:—could mark no trace of feet, No sign of life—before—around; Saw nothing move—heard not a sound— But keenly gazed into the gloom profound. No sound, indeed, no motion. All in tune With speaking Silence. Even the Moon Lulled in the lap of Heaven serene Lay back—albeit with watchful mien. Transfigured by her flooding rays To airy cloud, the Mountains blue Up to their floating goddess threw A rapt and meditative gaze. II. Upon the moonlit fractured rock beside him, With not a rustle that the ear would strike, A rapid-wriggling Lizard lightning-like Leapt into stoniest stillness. In the dark, Only a steady diamond spark Told where it watching stood and sidelong eyed him. “How well,” he thought, “these creatures suit, How well uphold their ill-repute; By all these natives held in dread, Because informed by Spirits of the dead.” In the full stream of light, Close to his cheek, projecting on his right, His glance was resting on a bright green sprig Of broom-like myrtle.—As he looked, it grew To something that was watching too. A span-long Phasmid then he knew, Stretching its forelimbs like a branching twig In air, and motionless as death— Save that it swayed its frail form to and fro Gently, as in a soft wind's dying breath, And then subsided slow To rigid stillness. There, Its forelimbs still outstretched in air, With startling faith in its weird wondrous trick Of aping lower life, the animated Stick In watchful mood Close to his cheek unmoving stood. III. Suspense how fixed and strange— Dumb witchery of magic change! Swift spritelike life to seeming death—and seeming Inanimate life to deathlike animation— The real and seeming seemed to waver, reel, and mingle! “One of those flashes for a moment gleaming,” Such our self-watching watcher's meditation— “When o'er the Soul the thought will pass, ‘Is it illusion then, this whole Creation, This outward Universe, a breath on glass?’— One of those pauses in the rush Of Life's phantasmagoric dreaming, When in the hush, The Spiritual speaks in vivid hints that tingle Through our material framework, listening vigilant; And as the deep-sea plummet, Consciousness, Strikes soundings on the eternal adamant Beneath the visionary Ocean Whereon our frail barks ever forward press, And rock and nod With such unquiet motion,— Lo! the revealing veil of God Called Nature—as transpierced by darkling light Divine—imprisoned splendour—on the fret To escape for all her cunning might, Emits keen sparkles in her own despite; And seems one moment almost to forget Her tantalizing trust, her mystic high vocation; Seems for a thrilling moment, just about To turn transparent wholly, and to let Her awful Secret out.” The conscious Silence seemed to win Its way across the fleshly dross To some responsive sense akin His own deep soul within; As in the shadowy river pool Below the rapids, still and full, Two floating globules nearing run Together into one. And now a little breath of air, That had, it seemed, been lurking there, Itself the moonlit calm enjoying, Along the white bright-shadowy cliffs behind him, Stealing as if glad to find him, Came creeping through his hair and with its clusters toying; Then passed—and left the lonely shore, Hushed and breathless as before. Again the haunting shy mistrust Of Nature's simplest doings thrust Its coy suggestive self between The sensuous impress on his brain And the conclusion, else so plain, Of what it was, might be or mean. Almost he could have held it true, That fancy of the land he knew, The creeping breeze must be a Spirit too He dallied with the whim awhile; Then with a musing smile, His idle quest renounced as vain, Turned his cottage to regain. IV. “What is there,” he thought, “in the scene, in the hour, The moonlight—the silence—that tempts us to dower All Nature thus with spiritual power? Can it be that their magical influence But awakes in ourselves a keener sense Of some mysterious manifold chain— The myriad channels that may knit Magnetic currents of the brain, Or subtler filaments more fit, Along which Thought and Feeling flit, To those that permeate Air and Earth And all things that from these have birth? Linking in one consentient whole All Nature to each living Soul; And opening for each Soul again Subtle ways of intercourse With every other, near, aloof; An infinite web of spiritual force, An universal warp-and-woof Of Sympathy; though yet but rare The minds whereby, the moments when, The mystic threads and what they bear (Like gossamers fine in autumn air That softly undulate, float, and run, Viewless but where they catch the sun) Are brought within the conscious ken?” V. Slowly, and with looks downbent, On such wayward thoughts intent, By the rocky path he went. Suddenly a hand is thrown Lightly, softly on his own. Lightly as rosy apple-bloom Comes twirling to the orchard-grass, When April winds that gaily pass Kiss it away to its sunny doom. So softly o'er his fingers flew That timid playful pressure too— The velvet plumage, all aglow With jetty black and violet blue, Of the crimson-billed porphyrio, That jerking struts among the cool Thick rushes by their rust-red pool— Felt never more soft, more downy-smooth. Quickly turned the startled youth, And the sight that met his eyes Brightened them with glad surprise. VI. There was a deeply scooped recess In the rock-side's ruggedness, Hollow and arching: you discern Through the moon-illumined gloom, Mantling it above, below, Wondrous work of Nature's loom— Delicate broidery like a bride's— Traceried wealth of many a fern. Some are filmy-fine and soaking wet, By the ever-oozing lymph Matted to its dripping sides; Some are thatch-like thick-layered—some plume-like and free; Some like fingers outspread, that caressing and fond Would clutch at all comers whoever they be; Some soft, silver-woven, down-pointing and broad, Like Seraphim's wings when their eyes they would shade From the shock of that Robe-Skirt's ineffable load Of splendour that else the high heavens dismayed! But finger-like, feather-like, wing-like,—each frond (As by daylight the curious eye might see!) Bedropt and bestudded and thickly beset With intricate, daintiest fancy-freaks Of golden spots and russet streaks. More gracefully draperied niche never yet Enshrined the pure graces of goddess or nymph; And rarely has Goddess or Wood-nymph been With statelier graces endued than were seen In the Maiden who stood in that alcove so green! Canto the Seventh. The Meeting. 1. Venus Anadyomene. A simile. 2. Amo in the moonlit grotto. 3. Her address. 4. Ecstasy speechless. 5. Native espousals. Ranolf's murmured Song. I. In days when Nature—ere discharmed— Undeified by Science—swarmed With bright Divinities akin To the energies terrific In her wilder phases working, Or in genial ferment lurking Mystic, magical, within, Slumbering in her blissful breast In daimoniac delitescence; Till with fervour too intense They would quicken and condense And kindle into visible presence And vitality specific, Glowing on the too imprest Keen sense in Shapes, appalling, grand Grotesque or graceful—Phantoms haunting And to human beauty moulding, For quick-fancied Faith's beholding, (Till all Earth was holy ground) All the still-eyed Soul that broods In wide wind-whispering solitudes— Each cloudchase chequering sea and land— Moon-shadows—sunny silences— Lone mists on fire in glens profound— Old half-lit trunks of twisted trees— And stealthy gleams in gloomy woods;— In those old days what dearer dreaming Than the Vision such deep feeling, Instantaneously revealing Traits of rare resemblance, fashioned Out of things so diverse-seeming, Ocean-foam and Love impassioned,— As it flashed in pictured splendour On the fine Ephesian brain?— Will devotion true and tender Ever at that shrine be wanting? Ever poet's heart refrain From a chance to touch again That wan sweet faith and form enchanting— Sweetest myth of all the train? Of all the mystic Shapes and mighty, Sovran, while Love's passionate pain Can the senses charm and chain,— That dream divine of Aphrodite Freshly risen from the main? Lo! upon the amber sands, Brilliant throbbing Apparition— As if poised in air she stands! Proudly conscious, frankly smiling, Sure of homage, love, submission; Mostly triumph—some surprise, In the dangerous innocent eyes, Where, what witchery world-beguiling Lies in childlike archness hid! Where the sense grows faint to mark How the purple depths that glow Like the velvet-petalled pansy, show Dark—almost too lovely-dark— Too like a stain almost,—amid All that gleam of snowy brightness, All her form's effulgent whiteness! While the dazzling flood of tresses Ripples like gold lines of light In a hanging waterfall, When you look from the curved rock-wall Behind it, through its crystal pall; Wavy sunbeams whence she presses With those rosy-tipped fair fingers Every diamond-drop that lingers Lovingly in their bright recesses. So was seen the Foam-born standing— So for ever standeth she In enamoured memory— Darling Anadyomene! While the leopard-sleek and fawning Sea Round her plays caressingly, Plays in many a broad festoon Of foam-flowers—many a sliding sheet Lovely-creaming, long-expanding, Then dying off in a luxurious swoon;— As if Poseidon love-beguiled, To beguile, attract, adore her, Ere he stood confest before her, Mocked the playful gambols mild Of some creature of the wild; And one sweet look to deserve, But one look so killing-sweet, Kept the simple wile repeating, Stealing swiftly, curve on curve, Bounding forward and retreating, Cowering, crouching at her feet! II. Like and unlike—such counterpart And contrast to that deathless dream of Art, As gay glad Sunrise when it breaks In splendour-smitten mist and sparkling dew, To all the deep-impurpled tenderness Of soft-illumined Sunset makes, Though both impress Their varying glories on the self-same view: So like and so unlike—the Vision bright That wrapt our Wanderer now in wondering wild delight. There, as the shy white crane, so rarely seen, Stands proudly gentle and reserved, Erect, but with her neck back-curved Her breast's light-waving snow to preen— There Amohia stood. Although downcast the rays Of her clear-shining eyes—and on her cheek The rosy flushings momently that broke Through the clear olive, some distress bespoke— Yet grandly winning and queenly-meek, Erect the Maiden stood. About her all Her affluent hair, unstirred by any breeze Fell sheltering—a sable silky pall. How like a strong ebullient swarm Of hive-o'erflowing honey-bees Forth issuing black and glad a hundred ways, Still soaking wet and dripping yet, The tendrilled tresses spread and ran and clung, Moulding dark gloss on many a balanced charm; And sinuously streaming Adown her polished shoulder palely gleaming, And rippling ebon-soft over her rounded arm, A natural drapery hung. O lovingly the Moonlight's sheeny whiteness On that unmoving figure slept! Here sweetly swelling into sudden brightness That through rich waves of jetty tracery beamed; There lost, as into sudden mellow shade Caressingly they curled and crept! Bewilderingly beautiful that chequering made The graces of a Form wherein it seemed A bounding spirit of young elastic Life essayed In conscious exultation To float and flow and wind and wander And on itself return in many a coy meander And subtle undulation: And yet—as all perfection blends Harmonious opposites for happiest ends— Seemed ever in its wild luxuriance chained And by a stronger spirit of proud reserve restrained, Upholding the fine form in wingèd lightness; As ivory serpents, held in graceful bond Would twine of old about a silver Hermes-wand. III. So Amohia stood—nor longer sported; Quite serious now, perhaps a little trembling; Yet, though her bosom's quickened rise And fall betrayed the anxious breathing, By clear unconscious innocence supported, And that sweet might of Nature when it knows Few laws conventional that teach dissembling; So that true Love in loving act o'erflows As truly, artlessly, in loveliest guise, As from the bud's moss-browned and tender sheathing, When Spring has swollen its crumpled tissues And filled them with its genial influence, issues That crimson apparition—the young rose. “Stranger—from far realms that lie Beyond the steep slope of the sky, Hapless Amohia, see, Chieftain's daughter though she be, Gives her love, her life to thee. Amohia throws aside Rank and chieftainship and pride; For the lonely Stranger's sake Every tie has dared to break; Dared desert, with him to roam, Father, Mother, friends and home; All the Atuas' wrath to brave, But to be the Stranger's slave.— Take her—teach her—till she be Worthy thy great race and thee!” “Dearest—loveliest—bravest Maid, Your true love shall be well repaid! But whence, and how, my grand Wildflower, Came you—and thus—at such an hour?” “I swam the Lake—was almost gone— Reached land and hither stole alone.” IV. Surprise a moment held him dumb; And why set down the words he spoke— Disjoined and crowded as the sum Of mingled feelings that within him woke?— What speech has Passion's mastering moods? what speech Is possible to any Ecstasy? Can finite words an infinite feeling reach, Or the mere bounded Intellect express The Soul's emotions in their boundlessness? No! as the sky-drawn moisture that distils Down from the sky-aspiring hills, A sea-side valley slowly fills; But, if some milder earthquake's pant Have slightly changed its downward slant, Suddenly bursts the marsh below And seaward rushes in mad overflow, Bearing before it to the mighty Main The wrecked and flowery richness of the plain, Till all the calm eternal blue, About the outlet of the river new, Is strewn with floating fragments—little isles Where still the clinging flax-flower smiles, Minute azolla-stains of ruddiest hue, And many a water-loving bloom that grew Luxuriant while the swamp its moisture could sustain:— So Speech and all the forms of Thought, Yea, every medium Intellect supplies, Are shattered and distraught, Whene'er the o'er-informing Soul doth rise And swell and sweep in native might On to its kindred Infinite; And broken words and images essay In vain the abounding current to convey, In vain to express the inexpressible; While blissful moans and happy murmurs tell,— And only they,— How the Eternal that within us sleeps, Stirred to its inmost mystic deeps, Is welling forth its own imperial way; Bursting the crust where Custom's weeds are growing, And its material marge triumphantly o'erflowing! V. What wonder therefore if our youth's emotion, With no coherent flow of phrases fair, Could answer that devotion? If, while beneath the showering night Of gleaming hair, dark eyes all light Burned on him—speaking speechless tendernesses, He could but answer, warm and wild, With many a fervent deep ejaculation Of pity, love and admiration; With broken words and tones endearing, Soothing, comforting and cheering; And the soul-converse was sustained With the only eloquence of passionate caresses, Kissed eyes and lips, and fluttering breath and fondled tresses, And throbbing hearts together strained: Till with his cloak around her thrown He led her to his dwelling lone; By all the law the land supplied So wedded and so made his bride: And as they went in rapturous tone Loving and low, half murmured and half sung A playful tender ditty in her native tongue: “Praise her—bless her—O caress her! lavish glorious gifts upon her; Piles of woven wealth to dress her—glossy-rippling robes of honour! O our Pride, the peerless, single,—many-vassaled Chiefs' descendant,— Flax o' the finest, silky-tasselled—breadth o'er breadth of costly chequer, Choicest broideries shall bedeck her! all to grace that form divinest, And its buoyant blithe uprightness, and its lithe and sinuous lightness, Rapture-fraught for souls supinest,—proudly, peerlessly array.— Range for birds of beauteous feather, marsh and mountain, dell and dingle; Stock-doves on whose necks resplendent rich reflections melt and mingle; Black Sultana-birds blue-breasted as deep Ocean in blue weather; Cuckoos, many a shy Sea-comer with its green dusk-golden glimmer, Lackey of the golden Summer, Sun-attendant;—and scarce dimmer Than that wanderer alien-nested, paraquitos crimson-crested, Like Spring's emerald verdure vested;—parrots dyed like dying day.— Weave their downy hues together—weave, relieve each tint transcendent; And the mantle bride-beseeming, fair as fairy gifts in dreaming, Round her shoulders shapely showing, wrap it fondly—fold the flowing Feathery softness, beaming, glowing, with the rainbow's radiance gay.— From her rounded neck dependent—where it curves so proud and stately, Where her buoyant bosom heaves in tranquil triumph how sedately, Precious trinkets, famous, greatly-storied from old days or lately, Lucid as transparent leaves in sunshine, shall their green display.— For her tresses—massy-streaming—floods of glittering gloom and brightness— Black as pine-trunks burnt and gleaming, charred and sunlit boles and bosses! Heron-plumes of snowy whiteness—down of sea-pure albatrosses— Like foam-flakes on torrents raving through swart chasms night-encaving— O'er those ebon wavelets waving,—shall the Chieftainess betray.— Then caress her—praise her—bless her; load her with delight and honour; Let no evil thing distress her; lavish all your love upon her!” VOLUME II.

The dawn, faint-tinted as a yellow rose, Peeped behind mountains purple-black as sloes; O'er these—a tuft of thick short shreds (not rays) Of brilliancy, the Morning Star ablaze— Awe-struck forerunner of the Sun beneath,— On the funereal darkness seemed to gaze, Checked at his sudden entrance on a scene Solemn with all the sable pomp of death, The thousand lights still burning for the Queen Laid out in state—the just departed Night.— Then Amo, starting from her brief repose, Urged upon Ranolf their immediate flight; For fly they must from that dread Priest she said, Or even her Father by his counsels led. Vain Ranolf's reasoned wish to try his skill Upon her sire, and bend perchance his will Into approval of their love.—“Nay—nay— Fly—fly!” she prayed, and he of course gave way: A power there's no resisting or ignoring,— A loving, loved and lovely one imploring! True, the romance of her proposal charmed; As o'er its possibilities he ran, Visions of risks defied his fancy warmed. To steal by night through unsuspecting foes, Or baffle them suspecting, was a plan At which his buoyancy of spirit rose. His followers therefore quickly paid—dismissed— Were Northward with his light effects sent back. One lad of Amo's tribe would still insist (Te Manu 'twas, who brought the fish that day, And served him since for pleasure and some pay) Out of new love for him and old for her— He should not from their side be forced to stir; Pleading his usefulness—to bear a pack, Cook—work—provide such comforts they would lack; Nay, to their safety sometimes minister. So be it then. What needs is promptly done; Revolver trim and double-barrell'd gun, Powder and shot and fish-hooks not a few, And axe, and matches, most essential too; Some extra mats for tent-roofs against rain; And—better currency than minted gold, A savage's best treasures to unfold— Allowance good of treacle-smelling cakes Of jammed tobacco-plaits; with odds and ends, The boy at cost of carrying would retain Of fancied value to himself or friends— Light shoulder-burdens—he or Ranolf takes. II. Prosaic details, truly! Lady mine— Who hold ethereal Love a power divine; O let it not your fervid faith displease, Romance so realistic stoops to these! Love is the prime of Gods—O clearly! A Thaumaturge and Master-mage is he; Let all confess him as puissant—nearly— As he conceits himself to be! Yes! yes! we know, and none deny, All risks, all ventures He will try, All checks and chances dare—defy! To his great heart and hope elate What are the threats of adverse Fate! How fade the frowns of Circumstance Before his forward-leaping glance! His course that ever forth and far Seems trained by some triumphant Star Shall rivers bound, shall mountains bar?— One look, and lo! from mouth to fountain Uprising from its gravelly bed, Each river, shrunk to a silver thread Floats gossamer-like across the lea; One waive or nod of hand or head, And every forest-puckered mountain Rocked from its base uneasily Goes crab-like lumbering to the Sea!— Shall not the Ocean heave up pearls To deck one Beauty's golden curls? Shall not the Stars come trickling down If one dear brow demand a crown?— Yes, fair ones! so shall you decree, And youthful hearts shall all agree In Love's divine supremacy! Though duller Deities the while May at his proud pretensions smile? Bid Cold and gaunt-eyed Hunger clip The splendour of his purple wings; And from his graceful shoulders strip The golden bow, the ivory quiver, Unless across them too he flings The wallet vile and vulgar scrip, Replete with gross substantial things; Nay, make the beauteous stripling shiver Unless to some frieze cloak he clings; Nor, jealous, let the bright Joy-Giver From Psyche's mouth the honey sip, And purse and press her sweet lips out To semblance of a tempting pout, Or round them bud-like for the bliss Of a playful passionate kiss, Till with his own he first have blown Each rosy frozen finger-tip. Ah sad! this glowing glorious God to see, And think what paltry hests and heeds may be Importunate, imperative as he! III. So to the forests on Taupiri's face O'er the low cliffs at first the three retreat There they can find a handy hiding-place, And Amohia rest through noonday heat. At nightfall they retrace their steps at first Uncertain—guided by immediate need Of shelter—and resolve their course to shape By Amo's counsel for the land that nursed Her mother, whose great brother ruled indeed O'er all the tribes about the earliest Cape The Sun salutes when his resplendent hair Shakes off the foam-flakes of his Ocean lair. There she was well-beloved; and both might there, She for her mother's, he for her sake, share The nigh-related Chief's protecting care, Secure alike from rescue and pursuit With one so potent of such good repute. So North of Roto-iti, East away, And for the seaside by the Bounteous Bay, Though from the route direct still given to stray, They travel; resting in the woods by day When needful, and by villages at night Passing with cautious speed; and none the less On Ranolf's part, with undisguised delight At all the shifts, suspenses, and success And stealthy freedom of their dexterous flight. IV. And thus o'er many a mountain wood-entangled, And stony plain of stunted fern that hides The bright green oily anise; and hill-sides And valleys, where its dense luxuriance balks With interclinging fronds and tough red stalks The traveller's hard-fought path—they took their way. Sometimes they traversed, half the dreary day, A deep-glenned wilderness all dark and dank With trees, whence tattered and dishevelled dangled Pale streaming strips of mosses long and lank; Where at each second step of tedious toil On forms of fallen trunks moss-carpeted, Perfect to every knot and bole, they tread, And ankle-deep sink in their yielding bed Of rottenness for ages turned to soil:— Until, ascending ever in the drear Dumb gloom forlorn, a sudden rushing sound Of pattering rain strikes freshly on the ear,— 'Tis but the breeze that up so high has found Amid the rattling leaves a free career! To the soft, mighty, sea-like roar they list:— Or else 'tis calm; the gloom itself is gone; And all is airiness and light-filled mist, As on the open mountain-side, so lone And lofty, freely breathing they emerge. And sometimes through a league-long swamp they urge Slow progress, dragging through foot-sucking slush Their weary limbs, red-painted to the knees In pap rust-stained by iron or seeding rush; But soon through limpid brilliant streams that travel With murmuring, momentary-gleaming foam That flits and flashes over sun-warmed gravel They wade, and laughing wash that unctuous loam Off blood-stained limbs now clean beyond all cavil And start refreshed new road-knots to unravel. And what delight, at length, that glimpse instils, That wedge-shaped opening in the wooded hills, Which, like a cup, the far-off Ocean fills!— V. Anon they skirt the winding wild sea-shore; From woody crag or ferny bluff admiring The dim-bright beautiful blue bloom it wore— That still Immensity—that placid Ocean— With all its thousand leagues of level calm, Tremendously serene! he, fancying more Than feeling, for tired Spirits peace-desiring, With the world-fret and life's low fever sore— Weary and worn with turmoil and emotion,— The soothing might of its majestic balm. Or to the beach descending, with joined hands They pace the firm tide-saturated sands Whitening beneath their footpress as they pass; And from that fresh and tender marble floor So glossy-shining in the morning sun, Watch the broad billows at their chase untiring: How they come rolling on, in rougher weather,— How in long lines they swell and link together, Till, as their watery walls they grandly lift, Their level crests extending sideways, swift Shoot over into headlong roofs of glass Cylindric—thundering as they curl and run And close, down-rushing to a yeasty dance Of foam that slides along the smooth expanse; Nor seldom, in a streaked and creamy sheet Comes unexpected hissing round their feet, While with great leaps and hurry-skurry fleet, His louder laughter mixed with her's so sweet, Each tries to stop the other's quick retreat. VI. Or else on sands that, white and loose, give way At every step, they toil; till labour-sped Their limbs in the noon-loneliness they lay On that hot, soft, yet unelastic bed, With brittle seaweed, pink and black o'erstrown, And wrecks of many a forest-growth upthrown, Bare stem and barkless branches, clean, sea-bleached, Milk-white,—or stringy logs deep-red as wine, Their ends ground smooth against a thousand rocks, Dead-heavy, soaked with penetrating brine; Or bolted fragment of some Ship storm-breached And shattered—all with barnacles o'ergrown, Grey-crusted thick with hollow-coned small shells— So silent in the sunshine still and lone, So reticent of what it sadly tells; Which Ranolf then imagines till he shocks Quick-sympathizing Amo with a tale Of brave men lost, and haply lovers gone For ever—never heard of nor forgot; And so beguiles the bright one of her tears, Which, while he kisses the wet cheek so pale He charms away, and the sweet mourner cheers, Hinting the contrast of their happier lot: Then turns to livelier sights the scene supplied; And near some river-mouth—shoal—marshy-wide— Would mark the swarming sea-birds o'er the waste Tremble across the air in glimmering flocks; Or how, long-legged with little steps they plied Their yellow webs, in such high-shouldered haste Pattering along the cockle-filled sandbanks, Some refuse dainty of the Sea to taste; Or standing stupified in huddled ranks Still rounded up by the advancing tide— White glittering squadrons on the level mud Dressing their lines before the enclosing flood; Or what strange instinct guided them so well, Posed by their mollusk, up in air to start, And soaring, on the rocks let fall the shell Whose stubborn valves they could not force apart. VII. And once, hard by a gloomy forest-side, Death-still and stirless all—save where one sees A shaking glimmer of silver through the trees— How Amo clapped her hands in pure delight At Ranolf's puzzled wonder when he spied What seemed so surely—for 'twas clear in sight— Some furry three-legged thing—no tail—no head— Fixed to the ground—a tripod!—how amazed Was he to find when serpent-like it raised Long neck and bill, and swiftly running fled, 'Twas nothing but that wing-less, tail-less bird Boring for worms—less feathered too than furred— The kiwi—strange brown-speckled would-be beast, Which the pair hunted half the day at least, While needful look-out young Te Manu kept. Or else the lovers, tired or cautious, stepped From the chalk-bouldered, pumice-crumbling strand On to black broken-edged o'erlapping land; And o'er the flax-swamped rushy level then Betook themselves to some inviting wood Just at the black-green opening of a glen Where mighty trunks—grim shadowy columns—stood, Solemn, expectant,—promising so meet A shelter for their day or night retreat. Shore-loving vine-trees, púriri, they were The enormous mounds that, piled in swelling state, Seemed cracking only with the very weight Of light green foliage-masses everywhere So caked, smooth-rounded and consolidate. —How free—how free it was! nothing it seemed, Between themselves and God! so Ranolf felt;— That world of Man, how oft it seemed to melt Wholly away! his Soul in contact brought With Nature's nakedness, exulting teemed With raptures Life refined had never bought; Proud vigour from her vivid touches caught; And from the exhilarating hale embrace Drew hardier, wilder will to set at nought All risks—and dauntless every danger face!— Yet little this was needed now—although Amo could not her anxious fears forego; For dread of all that Priest might prompt destroyed Half of the pleasure she had else enjoyed. VIII. Now, through some dim white days of ceaseless rain, They waited till the sky should clear again, Roofed by a hut no woodman would demur To call a palace for a forester. Amid the trees—where loftiest towering grew Some spiny-leaved totáras like the yew, Root-buttressed, forty yards or so in height,— They—ere the mist first gathering blanched the blue Though many a sign that threatened rain they knew— Had built a hasty homestead snug and tight. Some of these trees, notch-circled near the ground, That for such end their bark might well be dried, Or trunks be seasoned for canoes, they found; Their stringy coats were easily off-stripped, In stripes, long, broad and heavy, upward ripped; These, fastened on a frame of poles flax-tied, Slant roof and walls against the windward side— Made such a pleasant dwelling in six hours As had withstood a month of drenching showers; Thick fern and broom were fragrant floor and couch; And to the sweetclean roof and walls upslung, Guns, shot-belt, matches, flints and powder-pouch And change of raiment, dry and safely hung. IX. In this retreat three quiet days they passed In perfect shelter; and the time flew fast, Though to the hut they mostly were confined, And spite of care that lurked in Amo's mind. Love wrapped in sunshine that rain-beaten bower, Made prisoned solitude and silence dear; Her care diverted, half-assuaged her fear; Surcharged e'en trivial chat with eloquent power; To slight details of daily intercourse Gave magic sweetness and electric force; Nay, lent to weeping Nature's gloomier hour A gentle charm they ne'er before descried When bathed in brilliant light her features smiled. So Ranolf felt when over wood and wild That quiet sadness first began to creep; And sheltered safe within their mountain-nook On his fern-pillow he could lie and look Past forest tree-tops surging down the steep, With rocks out-slanting bold, dark-red and grey— Through the glen's mouth, o'er yellow plains outside, Mixed with the skies, it seemed, so high and wide— Melting to misty dimness far away;— Look—but to feel with more supreme content That luxury of loneliness profound— No human soul but theirs for miles around; Feel how serenely, pensively forlorn The tender silence of the tearful Morn; Of those unmoving trees as still as thought, And leaves imbibing in their happy sleep Rich greenness ever more refreshed and deep; Each branch with bright drops hung that would not fall: The faint blue haze upon the grass; while nought But the slight tremble, shimmering on the shade So glowing dark about their stems, betrayed The fine soft rain's inaudible descent. Then, as the thickening weather with its pall Of gloom shut out the distant hills and sky, How pleasant there to lounge secure and mark Emerging from the mists in forests high Black jutting trees to shadows turn, and fade, Where sullen, ragged, smothering vapours weighed Upon the nearer summits; or when wind Arose, and hurried up the storm, behind Their hill-protected hut and roof of bark— To mark each sudden, snowy, crooked skein With fibres opening here and there, appear Along the sloping hollows all pure green But now—inlaid between round knolls, and seen White through thin clouds of level-driving rain. X. And then within their wildwood home, what cheer— What manifold amusements might be found! What pleasure in the necessary round Of primitive provisions for so rude A life—whose mere privations still endued The hours that flew so fast with fleeter wings; The merry makeshifts, and the thousand things To tax contrivance, whence ingenious tact A double comfort from discomfort wrings: Scant implements still put to novel use; Forced partnership in many a little act For which e'en Love had else scarce found excuse. Then Ranolf had in note-book to record Brief hints of many an incident or word That might the vivid memory reproduce Of these bright scenes far hence when they should be Forgotten into freshness. Or he made Upon the inside smoothness of a square Of that stripped bark, with pistol-barrel ruled, Draft-chequers,—clipping flat for draughtsmen rare Hard violet drupes of the great laurel-tree And gold karaka-dates—and soon had schooled His quick companion in the game they played For kisses like Campaspe! though, he said, Amo from Cupid had not cared to win Cheek-bloom—lips bow-curved—tender turn of chin— Hers sweeter far already! Or he strove With taste, and skill—but not in like degree— Still quickened, still impeded by his love— Sketch-book on knee, to reproduce, though slight, Some glimpses of the spirit-winning light That danced in dazzling depths of Amo's eyes— Some of her shape's enchanting symmetries; While she, with wondering bright compliance bore The frequent interruptions and delay To the immediate work she had in hand, As he so oft entreated her to stay In that position just one moment more— Just to continue so to kneel or stand— Reach up—bend over—let him seize the charm Of some fine posture, planted foot, or arm Upraised, that any Sculptor's heart might warm. XI. And truly, every instant she displayed A look or attitude that would have made A Phidias turn admiring, though intent On one fastidious finishing touch, the last— One pumice-polish, warm wax-stain, that lent Perfection to some wonder, now complete, Some marble miracle or famous feat Chryselephantine, all the world to beat, And stamp his own surpassing self surpassed! Though on his ears, already charmed, he felt Aspasia's clear Milesian accents melt In critic subtleties of praise that seize The heart of his conception, and excite The stoic soul of stately Pericles Into confest emotions of delight. Some look or gesture was each instant shown That with as happily-tempting hints—assured Forecast of chiselled triumphs, had allured A Flaxman, say, that Phidias of our own— As when at his soul's call, with beauty aflame And dignity and grace immortal, came (All chastened—checked by Art's severest curb— Harmonious calm no passion could disturb) Trooping divinities in grand array, As if Olympus were his freehold—they His tenants—slaves—who heard but to obey!— But as the busy Maid would oft look round With brows and high-upcurling lashes raised And such a glance, what Ranolf wished—to ask— Bright glance of innocent inquiry—sweet Alert attention; or would leave her task, And throw herself beside him on the ground To see what 'twas that he would sometimes look Half-pleased with, proud of, in the fast-leaved book Where he “wrote images”—then with such heat Would “pish” and “pshaw” at, as on her he gazed, Abused the work so much—the model praised; There, as she watched him, toying all the while With those light locks she loved so, with a smile Where such a depth of playful fondness shone; Did she not then the very vision seem Young Foley saw, when, scarce to manhood grown, He brought old Athens back in that bright dream Of Ino feeding her maternal joy On purple temptings of her grape-fed boy?— Or that which bade his great compeer achieve The new-born loveliness of listening Eve? XII. But could wise Nature's so conspicuous Art,— Lavish of might divinest to unfold The gleam and glory of mere human limbs Which all beside of form and hue bedims,— If ever, fail with this susceptive heart And fiery Sense, in her design to raise That fervid admiration, uncontrolled And uncontrollable, she must intend Should ne'er be foiled for fairest moral end?— No! well might that pure form, as he surveys Its rich proportions cast in such a mould— The perfect mould of Beauty, that combines Rare lightness with luxuriance, and displays What subtle joy can lurk in sinuous lines That in their delicate winding wavure seem Self-singing of their fine felicities Like musical meanderings of a stream; Well might its melodies of movement thrill His soul with rapture—dash his baffled skill With blank despair, as lovingly he tries To fix the fluent loveliness—portray Some one perfection from the plastic play Of flitting statue-pictures that displace Each other, and successive charms efface In ever new varieties of grace!

Ranolf and Amo in their bark-built tent Were busy; she, in sylvan arts adept, With scraps of fern drybrown from where they slept, And moss from underneath thick boughs, in spite Of damp, preparing her quick fire to light: But with grave brow half-puzzled how to glean A savoury meal from viands well-nigh spent: And he, in prospect of the brightening weather, Intent, but leisurely, with loitering mien, On ferreting with purple-glossed green feather— The wild-duck's, moistened with its searching oil— Into the fastenings of his rifle's lock, The shining intricacies rust would spoil; Still pausing in his task, with banter fond Her over-anxious care for him to mock, To which, no whit disturbed, she would respond Her fixed conviction what to him was due: Or, if a longer silence intervened Wondering what strange wild tameness towards him drew The large grey-coated robin—kinsman true Of England's delicate highbred bird of home,— So fine-limbed, full of spirit!—how 'twould come After a little startled flight or two And perch upon the very gun he cleaned.— 'Twas then, Te Manu—who, sent off to scout, A cloak of perfect thatch about him thrown, Had fetched a wary compass wide about To a far village off their route—prepared With preconcerted tale—was seen alone Returning from the journey safely dared, O'er the dim plain—a shadow: till as near He drew, the triumph on his face was clear. Laden he came—though nought for loads he cared When self-imposed by fancy for good cheer; Cray-fish; plump pigeons in their fat preserved, Neat-packed in pottles of dark wood, adorned With carvings arabesque so quaintly curved; Store of that tiny fish like whitebait, dried In sunshine on hot stones; with scraps beside Of native dainties nowise to be scorned. II. And when his shoulders from the pack were freed, With joyous face he told them news indeed: How he had met a traveller newly come From Rotorua, and from him had learnt the sum Of all that there had happened; how at first When missing Amohia's clothes were found Upon the shore, all had believed her drowned: Then what a wailing had ensued—a burst Of genuine grief—no counterfeiting show; What gashing of the breast with shells, and flow Of blood had marked the matrons' gory woe; How Tangimoana had torn his hair And curst his gods in frenzy of despair, And raved against the Priest whose scheming greed His own too ready confidence had wronged, And driven his darling to the desperate deed; (From Miroa was that certain fact derived); Then what a coolness rose between the two. And how when Ranolf's absence so prolonged, Begun that very day, had roused more true Suspicions, fresh inquiry set on foot Led to the knowledge that the pair had been By accident upon their journey seen. And then the Priest so hotly urged pursuit His obvious spite provoked a new dispute; For Tangi's heart such great revulsion swelled Of rapture that his dearest Child survived, It found no room for thoughts of hate and rage, And all the vengeful Priest's advice repelled Almost with scorn; whereat the other turned Livid with sulky wrath that inly burned, And no amends of Tangi's could assuage; At which all wondered; (here in Amo's breast An undivulged remembrance more than guessed The jealous fury that his heart possessed:) And how the Priest soon from the Island went, None knew when, whither, or with what intent— Went mutely maddening with his fancied wrong Though muttering vengeance and return erelong; At which in hardy confidence so strong Stout Tangi only laughed; and longed to see His hoary age's pride again, and press Her brow against his own in fond caress; Yearned for her home—companioned should she be By husband, fair or tawny—what cared he!— III. “But what of Miroa?” Amo asked—“her friend?”— Ah! there too he had tidings somewhat strange, He answered, with a shrewd and prying glance Eyeing the beauteous questioner askance: “O'er Miroa there had come a curious change Since Amo left, which none could comprehend At first; for she—that merry maid—had grown Sad, absent, sullen-seeming; given up all Her favourite haunts and friends to muse alone; Thrown all the sports and frolic games aside Of which she was the leader, life, and pride; The lively matches with the dangling ball Struck at each other by the seated band; The hunted pebble passed from hand to hand; ‘Káhu’ the ‘hawk’ of rushes she could weave And coax with scarce-seen string to soar so high That all the children said it must deceive The living hawks they saw beside it fly; The háka-dances where she shone supreme, For gayer postures who could shape or dream? With half her archness give each new grimace Or shake the quivering hands with saucier grace? The skipping-rope she never had to hold, For who could ever trip her nimble feet? Maui, the string she could dispart and fold With dextrous fingers into forms complete Of all things 'twas your fancy to behold— Canoes, men, houses, wonders new and old— Great Mother Night producing all her train Of Gods—or cutting with swift snap in twain Even Maui's self—inventor of the game, For daring to invade that darksome dame: All these poor Miroa had discarded now And moped and slunk about with moody brow. IV. “Well, all believed it was for Amo's loss The shadow lay upon the damsel's heart; Till recently they saw her one fine day Alert and brisk, preparing for a start, It seemed, to visit some one far away: For she was with a studied neatness drest, Her curling locks smoothed to their brightest gloss— And striving spite of grief to look her best; A light food-kit was o'er her shoulders slung:— When questioned, she declared she meant to make Her way to Roto Aira's distant Lake, Where welcome she could always find among Near relatives that loved her; and you know Where'er she pleased the Maid could always go— For who would check her movements—interfere With one that Amohia held so dear? But she by accident was overheard That morning when she thought none near her stirred, Plaintively crooning o'er an artless song (While to and fro her form impatient swayed), That told what secret on her spirit weighed; The more, that from her bosom she was seen To draw some finery—woven flowers or braid— That there it seemed she must have cherished long, And press them to her brow with passionate mien And many tears—redoubled as she gazed Awhile upon these tokens of desire How vain! then flung them on her matin fire: But when they quickly shrivelled up and blazed, Gone like her dream for ever! she arose Passing her slender hands with gesture swift Across her brows and sweeping back the drift Of streaming tresses, as she waved her head And tossed her arms out wearily once—like those Who brush aside a troublous dream:—so she Seemed in that act to shake herself quite free From that entangling coil of memory. Then started on her journey as I said. But these proceedings and the song combined, And most that wreath—the withered flowery string, Red feathers from the parrot's under-wing, And scarlet band—that shining foreign thing— Told them 'twas for the Stranger that she pined.” Scarce had the word been uttered, ere with eyes That flashed a sudden fire, fair Amo threw Her arm round Ranolf as if danger near Were threatening to despoil her of her prize, Her heart's whole treasure; then withdrew it too As swiftly—blushing at her foolish fear, And asked, her bright confusion to disguise, More than from any wish the lay to hear, What song it was made Miroa's love so clear?— “‘E tangi—e—te ihu’—what comes next I'm sure I quite forget, although I heard: At waiatas I always was a dunce. 'Twas all about a girl or some one—vexed At scandal—full of wants and whims absurd.” V. But Amo recognized the words at once, And knew the song of course; and at request Of Ranolf, with an accent that expressed Compassion mixed with somewhat of disdain, Recited in sweet tones the childish strain, Whose meaning this loose version may explain: 1 “Alas, and well-a-day! they are talking of me still: By the tingling of my nostril, I fear they are talking ill; Poor hapless I—poor little I—so many mouths to fill— And all for this strange feeling, O this sad sweet pain! 2 O senseless heart—O simple! to yearn so and to pine For one so far above me, confest o'er all to shine— For one a hundred dote upon, who never can be mine! O 'tis a foolish feeling—all this fond sweet pain! 3 When I was quite a child—not so many moons ago— A happy little maiden—O then it was not so; Like a sunny-dancing wavelet then I sparkled to and fro; And I never had this feeling, O this sad sweet pain! 4 I think it must be owing to the idle life I lead In the dreamy house for ever that this new bosom-weed Has sprouted up and spread its shoots till it troubles me indeed With a restless weary feeling—such a sad sweet pain! 5 So in this pleasant islet, O no longer will I stay— And the shadowy summer-dwelling, I will leave this very day; On Arapá I'll launch my skiff and soon be borne away From all that feeds this feeling, O this fond sweet pain! 6 I'll go and see dear Rima—she'll welcome me I know, And a flaxen cloak—her gayest—o'er my weary shoulders throw, With purfle red and points so free—O quite a lovely show— To charm away this feeling—O this sad sweet pain! 7 Two feathers I will borrow, and so gracefully I'll wear, Two feathers soft and snowy for my long black lustrous hair; Of the Albatross's down they'll be—O how charming they'll look there— All to chase away this feeling—O this fond sweet pain! 8 Then the lads will flock around me with flattering talk all day— And with anxious little pinches sly hints of love convey; And I shall blush with happy pride to hear them . . . I daresay . . . And quite forget this feeling, O this sad sweet pain!” VI. So with much grief for Miroa's fond distress, The pair recalled full many a sign that might Have helped them read her simple heart aright, Had both not been too much pre-occupied With fancies of their own at hers to guess: And they remembered with what eyes—how wide— Of eager wondering gladness she had seemed To feed and fasten on all Ranolf's ways And looks and movements, when, those two first days, They met at Rotorua; how they beamed When with such giggling blushes of delight She bent her head as carelessly he tied The ribbon round it he declared less fair And tasteful than the wreath already there, Of crimson feathers and the snowy rays Of clematis—while all might see she deemed The present of less value than the praise. And then it flashed on Amo's mind, as sped Her memory back, with such a cue supplied, How artfully and oft the Maid would guide Their talk the way that to the Stranger led; And when that theme was reached, how glibly ran Her tongue, unceasing when it once began In Ranolf's favour mostly, or would raise Some point against him—find some fault—aver Some blemish—that she, Amo, might demur More warmly—more unguardedly be brought To sound his dear deserts for whom she fought, And his light-jesting enemy upbraid: All which the unsuspecting Amo thought She did to humour, not herself but her— The foolish Mistress, not the foolish Maid; (With an arch glance at Ranolf this was said:) And then she recollected once, when turning Suddenly, with what surprise she caught Poor Miroa's bloodshot eyes fixed on her, burning With envy, almost hate; with what swift check She changed that look to one of passionate yearning, And wildly flung her arms round Amo's neck And burst into a flood of tears, and cried: “My good, good Mistress—O how good and kind And always dear—O do not mark or mind The passion of your worthless slave—too bad For such a mistress—O too false and mad! Kill, kill me if you will—you should—you may— But tear this blackness from my breast away!”— “And then she lavished on me little acts Of kindness and attention all that day. And I, still blind to these so patent facts, Thought 'twas the memory of her home afar And friends, from whom long years ago in war She had been torn—a captive, that oppressed Her fancy then, with fond regrets distressed; Although I rather wondered she was moved By that so deeply—scarcely could ascribe Such passion to such cause; for she had known Nothing but kindness, since, so terrified That day she came she shuffled to my side, And I scarce older, set her numbed limbs free From bonds, and said she should belong to me. But since that day so merry had she grown— She, sprung too from a chief of good degree— That all our people looked upon and loved The Child as a true daughter of the tribe, I always as a sister of my own.” VII. Well, so they grieved for Miroa: yet no less Perhaps, and shall we blame her if 'twere so? This very feeling for poor Miroa's woe, Though Amo's love for her was true indeed, In her unconscious heart could not but breed A secret feeling she would not confess Of greater joy in her own happiness. And cheering up, she said—“You may depend On this—from what Te Manu says, our friend Has overcome and shaken off her pain; That song would tell it—but still more the power To burn the keepsake—what was it? the flower Or ribbon you bestowed in luckless hour. And she has lovers, O in plenty—she! And there was one on whom she always smiled, I thought; a lad who lives or I mistake, A fine good lad, beside that very Lake And near the friends shemust have gone to see; She will be happy soon—dear merry Child! Though how she could get o'er such love”—the rest Was hidden with her face on Ranolf's breast. VIII. Then, as they marked the sky still growing bright The distant mountains visible once more, Black-blue, with smothering fleeces flattened o'er Their ridges—sprawling harpies snowy white With claws that clutched their summits hid from sight Or like a sudden foam-sea, o'er each brow Arrested in its branching overflow; The pair made ready for a happier start, Free to obey each prompting of the heart, Go where they list—all apprehension flown— And give themselves to Love and Joy alone. Canto the Third. Love and Nature luxuriant. 1. The happy Lover. 2. Love's young dream. 3. A Latter-day Eden. 4. A suitable home for the fascinating dread Deity. 5. Rest in the Forest. The beautiful Palm. 6. Expressions of trees—suggest more than the ‘pathetic fallacy.’ 7. Forest luxuriance. I. A king—a God—a little Child Your happy Lover is; a Saint With all the Eternal Powers at one— Serene—confiding—reconciled: He thinks no ill—believes in none; There is for him no sin, no taint, No room for doubt, disgust, complaint, Misgiving or despondence faint: Life's mystery flies, her secret won, Like morning frost before the sun; How should its cobweb ties arrest The triumph of his bounding breast! How should he feel, with actual heaven In measureless fruition given, The mounting spirit's mortal load? Feel, steeped in empyrean day And rapture without stint bestowed, The Mind too big for its abode, The Soul's discomfort in its clay? Why look to some seraphic sphere For light, for love, so lavish here? In this our gorgeous Paradise Why bend to grief—why stoop to vice? Ah why distrest and sorrow-prest— Why not be right and brave and blest? How easy, in a world so bright To be, to live, blest, brave and right!— He breathes Elysium—walks on wings; His own unbounded bliss he flings O'er all deformed, unhappy things: Transfigured are they—glorified; Or vanish and cannot abide The flood of splendour, the full tide Of joy that from his heart so wide Wells over all the world beside. O Melodist unequalled—Pride Of Nature's self-taught songsters he! Inspired—unconscious—mute too soon— Who sets and sings his lyric Life-song free To glad Creation's high triumphant tune! II. So for herself and most for her beloved All anxious cares and fears removed, So upon Amohia now unclouded beams— In rounded fulness of possession streams Once more the dream of dreams— The dear divine delirium! say Once to all by fate allowed; Though from its shy crescent small, That finest silver eyelash, fall Only its earliest rising ray; Clothing them ever with a luminous cloud Wherein they may a sweet while stray, In the thronging whisper-play Of Angel-wings, on life's highway; Monomaniacs, in the charge Of Beauty,—blissfully at large 'Mid the sadly saner crowd. III. —But we pause—we pale before it, Fairest reader—that soft splendour! And your pardon we implore it, If in sight of scene so tender Heart and voice we haply harden, And with faltering step pass o'er it, That sequestered Eden-garden; Painting in evasive fashion Two young lovers, wildly loving, Through a lovely region roving, Free as Nature—free as birds are, Free as infants' thoughts and words are! Ah! too rich for our rude treating, Too exalted for our story That intense absorbing passion— That fine fever of young Love; Which though cheating, swiftly fleeting, Oft it seem to mock and flout us, Comes so innocent, undesigning, Comes into our darkness shining, Comes and wraps the mystic glory Of the golden Heavens about us! And though pining or declining, Buried—pent here—without vent here— Lone—a stranger, wild, erratic; Soon returning to the burning Blisses of its home above— Leaves a bud elsewhere to blossom, Leaves a light in every bosom;— Just revealing ere off-stealing, One brief glimpse of soul-enjoyment, To endure a memory sure— Pure—a secret life-refiner And great lure to realms diviner, Where abandonment ecstatic To the infinite of feeling— Loftier love than aught existent, Ever by indulgence growing Deeper, fonder, and more glowing— Tide at flooding still new flowing, Flower fresh-budding while full-blowing— Is consistent—is persistent, Is our normal, true employment! IV. But say, in any Age of Gold Or song-lit classic clime of old, Where the amorous azure zephyr-fanned Caressing kissed with murmur bland Some finely-pebbled Paphian strand; Where Cyprian seawinds whispering made Love-plaint in hot Idalian glade And marble-templed mulberry-shade; Or where with wanton freaks and frets Sang rough Cythera's sparkling jets And silvery-laughing rivulets; Or out of sight and sunshine slipped, And lone in limestone cave and crypt, Slow heavy tears in silence dripped;— Were ever loveliest scenes in sooth So typically fit to be A birthplace and a home for thee, Impassioned Love! as these that see Our sylvan Maid, our sailor Youth Love-linked go loitering where they list, Love-led through Love's own mighty Mist? A wondrous realm indeed beguiled The pair amidst its charms to roam. O'er scenes more fair, serenely wild, Not often summer's glory smiled; When flecks of cloud, transparent, bright, No alabaster half so white, Hung lightly in a luminous dome Of sapphire, seemed to float and sleep Far in the front of its blue steep; And almost awful, none the less For its liquescent loveliness, Behind them sunk, just o'er the hill, The deep Abyss profound and still, The so immediate Infinite! That yet emerged the same, it seemed, In hue divine and melting balm, In many a Lake whose crystal calm Uncrisped, unwrinkled, scarcely gleamed; Where Sky above and Lake below Would like one sphere of azure show, Save for the circling belt alone, The softly-painted purple zone Of mountains—bathed where nearer seen In sunny tints of sober green With velvet dark of woods between, All glossy glooms and shifting sheen; While here and there, some peak of snow Would o'er their tenderer violet lean. And yet within this region, fair With wealth of waving woods—these glades And glens and lustre-smitten shades, Where trees of tropic beauty rare With graceful spread and ample swell Uprose; and that strange asphodel On tufts of stiff green bayonet-blades, Great bunches of white bloom upbore, Like blocks of seawashed madrepore, That steeped the noon in fragrance wide, Till by the exceeding sweet opprest The stately tree-fern leaned aside For languor, with its starry crown Of radiating fretted fans, And proudly-springing beauteous crest Of shoots all brown with glistening down, Curved like the lyre-bird's tail half-spread, Or necks opposed of wrangling swans, Red bill to bill—black breast to breast;— Aye! in this realm of seeming rest, What sights you met and sounds of dread! Calcareous caldrons, deep and large With geysers hissing to their marge; Sulphureous fumes that spout and blow; Columns and cones of boiling snow; And sable lazy-bubbling pools Of sputtering mud that never cools; With jets of steam through narrow vents Uproaring, maddening to the sky, Like cannon-mouths that shoot on high In unremitting loud discharge Their inexhaustible contents: While oft beneath the trembling ground Rumbles a drear persistent sound Like ponderous engines infinite, working At some tremendous task below!— Such are the signs and symptoms—lurking Or launching forth in dread display— Of hidden fires, internal strife, Amid that leafy, lush array Of rank luxuriant verdurous life: Glad haunts above where blissful love Might revel, rove, enraptured dwell; But through them pierce such tokens fierce Of rage beneath and frenzies fell; As if, to quench and stifle it, Green Paradise were flung o'er Hell— Flung fresh with all her bowers close-knit, Her dewy vales and dimpled streams; Yet could not so its fury quell But that the old red realm accurst Would still recalcitrate, rebel, Still struggle upward and outburst In scalding fumes, sulphureous steams. It struck you as you paused to trace The sunny scenery's strange extremes, As if in some divinest face, All heavenly smiles, angelic grace, Your eye at times discerned, despite Sweet looks with innocence elate, Some wan wild spasm of blank affright Or demon-scowl of pent-up hate; Or some convulsive writhe confest, For all that bloom of beauty bright, An anguish not to be represt! You look,—a moment bask in, bless, Its laughing light of happiness; But look again—what startling throes And fiery pangs of fierce distress The lovely lineaments disclose;— How o'er the fascinating features flit The genuine passions of the nether pit!— But whatsoe'er of dark and dread May be in Love's wild bosom bred, Now on his ardent votaries shone His bright and beauteous moods alone. V. Amo and Ranolf slowly journeying home, Had to a pleasant place for camping come Inside a glorious forest; and although The atmosphere was still aglow With heat—the sun still shining high, Resolved that day they would no further go: Why should they haste—what seek or fly? Each rocky niche or woody nook Of most retired romantic look, There they could make their home, their rest, And choose next day as fair a nest:— 'Twas such a joy to journey so, How could their journey be too slow! So long as not compelled to sever, They cared not should it last for ever. The youth, with hands beneath his head, Against a great titóki's base, Where less compact and tangled spread The underbrush a little space, Lay watching, now the forest scene, Now Amo, as with accents gay And lovely looks and lively mien Directions to the lad she gave How best and where the stones to lay When heated well, and neatly pave The little hollow cleared away To make his oven in, and cook— In leaves close-folded, lightly sprinkled With water from the fretting brook O'er rocky bed that near them tinkled— The savoury palm-tree's pithy heart, By Ranolf just cut down—but not,— (Though many grew about the spot) Without—be sure—a little smart— Some slight compunction, for a meal To strike with his destructive steel, A thing so fair, a woodland treasure You could not look at without pleasure! A slim smooth pillar, ribbed and round, With drooping crimson chaplet crowned; O'er that,—erect, symmetric, chaste, A green Greek vase of perfect taste, With narrow neck and swelling side, Smooth-shining, sinuous; whence in pride Of beauty issued, spreading wide, A fan-like tuft of feathers free— All in artistic harmony! Nor this alone employed the lad; Intent upon a forest feast, A more attractive task he had— To raise and fix his three forked sticks, The little iron pot to sling He would on that excursion bring: Its use of all the white man's ways Had won his most decided praise; In Ranolf's service he at least Had learnt what pleasant things were made With its inestimable aid; And now with ducks and pigeons shot By Ranolf, he designed a stew, Should all his former stews outdo, Since he had shared a traveller's lot. VI. But watching thus the wood, or these, As Ranolf lay, his facile eye Ran o'er the shapes of plants and trees Exuberant round him, known or new. And while once more, as oft before, He marked with pleasure deep and true, What varied charms in form and hue Dear Nature's forest-children wore, It so did chance his curious glance Fell on a slender shrub hard by, All trace-work of transparent gold, Or gold and emerald blended,—neither, Yet far more beautiful than either! Against a ground of shadow black And soft as velvet at its back,— So delicately pencilled in green splendour, Stem branch and twig and leaflet tender So saturate with sunshine—such a flood Of light,—the exquisite creation stood!— Then out at once at that sweet sight, Outbroke in words his pure delight And admiration uncontrolled: “O the ineffable loveliness Of the green works of—Chance!!—how strange Their perfect power to mock each one some dress Our many-masquing Spirits wear; Mute, yet expert, like Music, to express In forms as it in sounds what mood soe'er The Soul may take through feeling's varied range! Look at that star-crowned beauty how she stoops, With what meek pride her plumy crest is bent! See that fair wanton's figure forward leant With open arms and every spreading spray In trustful, loving, frank abandonment; Mark that small spire, stiff—upright—almost pert, School-girl in class—or sentry all alert! What shrinking tenderness does one display, Another languidly despondent droops: Here, some advanced in bold defiance stand, While others crouch in shy reserve behind; There innocent grace, or full contentment bland, Or swelling pomp their fit exponents find: And see! how that dismantled forest-king Does his contorted silver branches fling, All bare to heaven, in wild despair, Or writhing agony of speechless prayer!— Surely that first formative Spirit unknown That to these innocent woodland things supplied Shapes with our inmost feelings so allied, By such foreshadowing evolution showed Its prescience of those feelings ere they rose; Nay, to the Finite stooping,—in a mode So beautiful and subtle and serene, Haply designed, if dimly, to disclose, To every sentiment within us sown Some mystical relation of its own Not all unsympathetic though unseen! VII. “But O their rich luxuriance! What a load That sturdy giant lifts in air! His mighty arms are strong and broad, But all with alien growths are furred, A shaggy hide of creepers rare; Their forks are all blocked up and blurred With tufts of clogging parasites That crowd till not a spot left bare Might offer footing for a bird!— And such her boundless vigour, see, Above, below, and everywhere, Exulting Nature so delights, So riots in profusion, she Twice over does her work for glee! A tangled intricacy first she weaves, Under and upper growth of bush and tree In rampant wrestle for ascendancy; Then round it all a richer overflow Of reckless vegetation flings, That here, close-moulding on the shrubs below A matted coat of delicate leaves, Mantles the muffled life whereon it clings Into a solid mass of greenery; There, mounting to the tree-tops, down again Comes wildly wantoning in a perfect rain Of trailers—self-encircling living strings Unravellable! see how all about The hundred-stranded creeper-cordage swings! And when the breeze, so loud without, Now tamed and awe-struck, gliding in, has found Amid the stately trees a stealthy way— How gently to-and-fro just o'er the ground The low-depending woody ringlets sway, Like panting creatures on the watch for play!” Canto the Fourth. Trees and the Tree-God. 1. Ranolf, on a hint from Amo, rhapsodises on beautiful trees and plants. 2. Amo affects jealousy; which tree shall she be? 3. Evening. 4. A kiss. I. What kindly Genius couching Poets' eyes— For Custom's cataracts dim the keenest sight— Gives them the Infant's crystal power to prize The simplest beauty that before them lies, Transparent to its wonder and delight?— “Why, Rano,” with her cheerful smile Said Amo, at her wifely tasks, the while He, as we told, in such enthusiast-style Revelled in all the leafy life, All the green revel round them rife: “If you were Tanë's self indeed, The Atua and the Father of the Trees, You could not of their ways take greater heed!” The fancy seemed his mood to please: “Hurrah!” he cried, and following her lead Went on, as with mock-solemn triumph fired, Half to himself, and half to her, as whim To speech or thought unspoken guided him, To dally with the notion she inspired: 1. “I am Tanë—the Tree-God! Mine are forests not a few— Forests, and I love them greatly, Moss-encrusted, ancient, stately; Lusty, lightly-clad, and new. Mottled lights and chequered changes, Mid all these my roam and range is; Shadowy aisle and avenue; Creeper-girdled column too: In the mystic mid-day night Many-mullioned openings bright; Solemn tracery far aloof Letting trefoiled radiance through! Many a splintered sun-shaft leaning Staff-like straight against the roof Of black alcoves overspread— Arched with foliage intervening Layer on layer in verdurous heaps, 'Twixt that blackness and the sun; With a tiny gap, but one, Light-admitting; brilliance-proof, Day-defying, all unriven Elsewhere—all beside offscreening Of the grand wide glow of Heaven! Or, where thinner the green woof Veils the vault of outer blue, Many a branch that upward creeps, Wandering darkly overhead Under luminous leafy deeps, Which an emerald splendour steeps From the noon that o'er them sleeps!— O I tend them, love, defend them, And all kindly influence lend them; For my worship all are suited, If, but, in the firm earth rooted, By the living air recruited, They, ere it grow withered, dull, Their green mantle beautiful, Still repair, revive, renew.” (Then to himself, more musingly:) “Many creeds, and sects and churches,—hopeful each its own way going; Bigots, sceptics, saints and sinners—precious to the Power all-knowing, So they keep absorbing ever more of Truth, the ever-growing.” (This, by the way, because he could not smother That inveterate tendency To find in all things symbols of each other.) 2. “I am Tanë—the Tree-God! My sons are a million; In every region, Their name it is legion; And they build a pavilion My glory to hold. Which shall my favourites be? Which are most pleasing to me, Of their shapes and their qualities manifold?— The gigantic parasite-myrtle That over its victims piles up Great domes of pure vermilion Filling the black defiles up: The King-Pine that grandly towers:— The fuchsia-tree with its flowers, Poor rustics that timidly ape Their sisters of daintier shape With their delicate bells downhung, And their waxen filaments flung So jauntily out in the air, Like girls in short crimson kirtle That spins in the wind as they whirl A-tiptoe one pointed foot, And one horizontal outshoot:— The clematis-garlands that curl And their graceful wreaths unfurl From many a monstrous withe; Snowy-starred serpents and lithe That in sable contortions writhe, Till Fancy could almost declare That great Ophiucus, down-hurled From his throne in the skyey star-world, Had been caught with his glittering gems 'Mid those giant entangling stems Which he deemed but a dwarfish copse, So was struggling and surging in vain To rear his vast coils o'er their tops And his gleaming lair regain!— Then the limber-limbed tree that will shower its Corollas—a saffrony sleet, Till Taupo's soft sappharine face is Illumined for wonderful spaces With a matting of floating flowerets— Drift-bloom and a watersward meet For a watersprite's fairy feet; 'Tis the kowhai, that spendthrift so golden: But its kinsman to Nature beholden For raiment its beauty to fold in Deep-dyed as of trogon or lory, How with parrot-bill fringes 'tis burning, One blood-red mound of glory! Then the pallid eurybia turning The vernal hill-slopes hoary With its feathers so faintly sweet And its under-leaves white as a sheet;— All of them, all—both the lofty and lowly, Equally love I and wholly; So that each take form and feature After its genuine law and nature Its true and peculiar plan; So that each, with live sap flowing, Keep on growing, upward growing, As high from the earth as it can! “Many creatures—varied features—dark and bright still onward moving; Tyrants—tumblers—boors and beauties, kings and clowns alike approving, To them all the Gods are gracious—to them all the Gods are loving. 3. “I am Tanë the Tree-God. What will you bring to me? Fruits of all kinds will I take So ripe, true fruits they be! Melting pulp—juicy flake— Sweet kernel or bitter— None are better—none fitter— All are grateful to me. But your shell with no lining Though splendidly shining; But your husk with a varnish That nought seems to tarnish; If any of these I espy, Empty and hard and dry, That serve but for clamour and clatter Or the genuine fruit to belie; These cheats will I shiver and shatter And their fragments scornfully scatter, O none of them bring to me! “Pains and passions—deeds and duties—virtues, vices—gifts and graces— Have not all, their value, uses—in their various fitting places— So they be not false pretences, mocking masks for natural faces?— “There, my sweet one, that is what, Were I Tanë (which, thank God, I'm not, Seeing mine's a happier lot) That is about what I should say, Had I my own, my wondrous way.” II. And Amo coming to his side amused, Her smiling eyes with tender love suffused, “How fond, O Rano mine,” said she, “Of these dumb things you seem to be; I shall be jealous soon, I think, And wish myself a Tree!” “A tree, my Amo! but I wonder which? O which so fair that we might link Such loveliness in fancy with its form? Which should be haven for a heart so warm, So sweet a Spirit's dwelling-place? The Rata-myrtle for its bloom so rich— Or Tree-fern for its perfect grace? Its slender stem I would embrace How fondly!—nay, but that would never do— That limbless tree-fern never should be you With nothing but a stem and plumy crest! Ah no! the glorious Rata-tree were best, With blooming arms that spread around—above; That should be you, my sole delight, My darling bliss! that so I might Embosomed in embowering beauty rest, And nestle in the branches of my love!” “Nay—but I would not be,” said Amo—“I, That Rata—if the change I had to try; Rather the snowy Clematis, to twine About the tree I loved; or rather yet That creeper Fern, with little roots so fine Along its running cords, it seems to get For its gay leaves with golden spots beset, Its dearest nurture from the bark whereto It clings so close; as if its life it drew, Drew all its loving life from that alone— As I from thee, Ranoro, all my own!” She paused a tender moment—then resumed: “Nay, not the Rata! howsoe'er it bloomed, Paling the crimson sunset; for you know, Its twining arms and shoots together grow Around the trunk it clasps, conjoining slow Till they become consolidate, and show An ever-thickening sheath that kills at last The helpless tree round which it clings so fast. Rather, O how much rather than destroy The thing I loved, the source of all my joy, Would I, my Rano, share the piteous fate The Rata's poor companion must await— Were you the clasper, I the tree that died, That you might flourish in full strength and pride!” “Nay—nay—my Amo! were't to be my doom To clasp you till you perished in your bloom, Neither to misery should be left behind— Together would we be to death consigned— In death, as all through life, in love entwined. But now, my lovely Clematis, be gay!— Though never shall I see that Rata bright, In murderous fondness, fastening round its prey The serpent-folds that hug the friend they slay, Without a sigh for the poor victim's plight; Without a wish to cut and cleave away The monster throttling what has been his stay; Without some wonder why the Power divine Includes such pictures in his world's design, And even in lovely vegetable life Leaves startling models of unnatural strife.” III. Thus they two in their dream. But Evening now Steals, like a serious thought o'er joyous face, Its cooling veil o'er the warm Earth to throw. The hawk no longer soars in pride of place, Stiff-wheeling with bent head in circles slow; The teal and wild-duck leave the floating weed And open pool, for sheltering rush and reed; And home with outstretched necks the cormorants fly In strings—each train dark-lettering the sky, Now V exact, now lengthening into Y— As arrow-like direct their course they steer To haunts afar, unseen, but somewhere near Those mountain-summits carpeted and black With forests dense without a break or track, Whence smooth and ferny spurs in golden dun Of solemn sunlight undulating run Down to dim bases lost in shadows blue That blot the intervening gullies too— Encroaching darkness creeping upward still O'er chequered black-and-gold of dell and hill. IV. “How pleasant is the life those birds must lead— About the sea all day to sport and feed, Where'er they will, with little heed; And flee away at night with aim so sure Striking across the sky, so eager each His inaccessible far roost to reach— So secret, solitary and secure In solitude. And is not ours like theirs— As free, as lonely sweet, as void of cares!” Said Ranolf, as beside him closer drew Fair Amo: “Yes, my wildwood dove, What have we else to do but live and love!” And she, her native tongue, no doubt, too weak, The fond delight that filled her heart to speak, Replied in one more rich, she felt, though new, That foreign language of a fervid kiss; Shaping her smiling lips as if they might Unlearnedly perform the mystic rite, Some feature of its due observance miss. “But see,” she hints, “Te Manu comes to say The kúkupas are done he takes such pride In cooking.”—As she spoke the youngster gay Came running up and grinning cried: Ranoro, come! come, Amo, quickly—do! Ka rá-we! 'tis a glorious stew!” Canto the Fifth. The Fountain-Terraces. 1. An illusion. 2. The great Terraces. 3. Silica-flowers. 4. The Moon. Beauty a true Evangelist. 5. Mahána—the warm Lake. Waterfowl. 6. The singing Islet. I. “How beautiful! how wonderful! how strange!”— Such words, less thought than mere emotion, well Might Ranolf with abated breath, in tone That wonder-stricken to a whisper fell, For Amo's looks of triumph now exchange: So fair a vision charmed our loiterers lone, As at the closing of a sultry day, In search of some good camping-ground They paddled up Mahána's Lake, Where they a small canoe had found (Which Amo settled they might take) With little care half-hid in sedge Flax-fastened to the water's edge— Its owners clearly far away. From the low sky-line of the hilly range Before them, sweeping down its dark-green face Into the lake that slumbered at its base, A mighty Cataract—so it seemed— Over a hundred steps of marble streamed And gushed, or fell in dripping overflow; Flat steps, in flights half-circled—row o'er row, Irregularly mingling side by side; They and the torrent-curtain wide, All rosy-hued, it seemed, with sunset's glow.— But what is this!—no roar, no sound, Disturbs that torrent's hush profound! The wanderers near and nearer come— Still is the mighty Cataract dumb! A thousand fairy lights may shimmer With tender sheen, with glossy glimmer, O'er curve advanced and salient edge Of many a luminous water-ledge; A thousand slanting shadows pale May fling their thin transparent veil O'er deep recess and shallow dent In many a watery stair's descent: Yet, mellow-bright, or mildly dim, Both lights and shades—both dent and rim— Each wavy streak—each warm snow-tress— Stand rigid, mute and motionless! No faintest murmur—not a sound— Relieves that Cataract's hush profound; No tiniest bubble, not a flake Of floating foam is seen to break The smoothness where it meets the Lake: Along that shining surface move No ripples; not the slightest swell Rolls o'er the mirror darkly green, Where, every feature limned so well— Pale, silent, and serene as death— The Cataract's image hangs beneath The Cataract—but not more serene, More phantom-silent than is seen The white rose-hued reality above. II. They paddle past—for on the right Another Cataract comes in sight; Another broader, grander flight Of steps—all stainless, snowy-bright! They land—their curious way they track Near thickets made by contrast black; And then that wonder seems to be A Cataract carved in Parian stone, Or any purer substance known— Agate or milk-chalcedony! Its showering snow-cascades appear Long ranges bright of stalactite, And sparry frets and fringes white, Thick-falling, plenteous, tier o'er tier; Its crowding stairs, in bold ascent Piled up that silvery-glimmering height, Are layers, they know,—accretions slow Of hard silicious sediment. For as they gain a rugged road, And cautious climb the solid rime, Each step becomes a terrace broad— Each terrace a wide basin brimmed With water, brilliant yet in hue The tenderest delicate harebell-blue Deepening to violet! Slowly climb The twain, and turn from time to time To mark the hundred baths in view— Crystalline azure, snowy-rimmed— The marge of every beauteous pond Curve after curve—each lower beyond The higher—outsweeping white and wide, Like snowy lines of foam that glide O'er level sea-sands lightly skimmed By thin sheets of the glistening tide. They climb those milk-white flats incrusted And netted o'er with wavy ropes Of wrinkled silica. At last— Each basin's heat increasing fast— The topmost step the pair surmount, And lo, the cause of all! Around, Half-circling cliffs a crater bound; Cliffs damp with dark-green moss—their slopes All crimson-stained with blots and streaks— White-mottled and vermilion-rusted. And in the midst, beneath a cloud That ever upward rolls and reeks And hides the sky with its dim shroud, Look where upshoots a fuming fount— Up through a blue and boiling pool Perennial—a great sapphire steaming, In that coralline crater gleaming. Upwelling ever, amethystal, Ebullient comes the bubbling crystal! Still growing cooler and more cool As down the porcelain stairway slips The fluid flint, and slowly drips, And hangs each basin's curling lips With crusted fringe each year increases, Thicker than shear-forgotten fleeces; More close and regular than rows, Long rows of snowy trumpet-flowers Some day to hang in garden-bowers, When strangers shall these wilds enclose. III. But see! in all that lively spread Of blue and white and vermeil red,— How, dark with growths of greenest gloss Just at the edge of that first ledge, (Calcareous string to cliff-formed bow O'er which the hot-pool trickles slow) A little rocky islet peeps Into the crater-caldron's deeps. Along the ledge they lightly cross, And from its midway islet gaze O'er all the scene—and every phase The current takes as down it strays. They note where'er, by step or stair, By brimming bath, on hollow reef Or hoary plain, its magic rain Can reach a branch, a flower, a leaf— The branching spray, leaf, blossom gay, Are blanched and stiffened into stone! So round about lurks tracery strewn Of daintiest-moulded porcelain-ware, Or coral wreaths and clusters rare, A white flint-foliage!—rather say Such fairy work as frost alone Were equal to, could it o'erlay With tender crust of crystals fair,— Fine spikes so delicately piled— Not wintry trees, leafstripped and bare, But summer's vegetation, rich and wild. IV. But while all this they watch, lo, still and grand, The enormous Moon!—how, like A great gold cymbal on its edge upright, Upon the mountain's ridge it takes its stand So close—there balanced broad and steady, To bathe in dreamily-magical light What seemed a magical dream already, Twice beautify the beautiful, and strike Transcended sense dead-mute with admiration!— And who could mark, with wondering soul-elation, That revel of redundant loveliness, Nor truths that Ranolf leapt to, half confess? “O these charms of great Nature! who ever has seen them In their glory as these are, nor owned that the notion They force on the thinker, is true, not illusive— That our senses and they, so composed as between them To awake in the mind such delightful emotion, Are proofs self-attested, as logic conclusive, Of Benevolence somewhere, in what can convene them— Adapt them to act and react on each other? A sentiment this, that no Science can smother. Nor condemn it as anthropomorphical folly, Since a cause they must have, one intelligent wholly, To hold that the Cause of these marvels must mean them To display that Benevolence—mutely reveal it In delight to the creature most fitted to feel it! —Aye truly! and though by stern reasoning's parity You maintain that in Nature, the baleful, disgusting Should be proof in its Cause of defect of such charity— That if Beauty be vaunted as sign of Benevolence, Deformity equally argues Malevolence,— Yet the first so outsplendours the last—so exceeds it— And the last has such uses, Mankind almost needs it— 'Tis hard not to side with the hopeful and trusting! Yes, cavil and carp, the nice balance adjusting, Yet is Beauty in literal truth, nothing less Than a Gospel—an embassy mute yet express From some Power imperial, of friendliness felt For mankind—say of Love! one that never will cease To diffuse its serene revelations of peace; Bright dawns and rich sunsets its eloquent books; And the broad laugh of flowers, and the soft-chiming brook's Secret murmurs of joy, and the rapture of birds, Its angelical whispers—accredited words: But holiest Woman's affectionate looks, Most thrillingly potent to move and to melt, Are the pages where clearest its plenary power Of divine Inspiration for ever has dwelt! And he who has basked but one bliss-giving hour In their sunshine and solace, like me must avow, With the loveliest lessons of Love, it is thou O Beauty, bright Mystic, the spirit canst fill; Aye, 'tis Thou, in all shapes, of celestial good-will, Art the sweetest, most suasive Evangelist still!”— V. Content that night no more to see, The wanderers push off merrily To what that night their home shall be: A little rugged isle (another Beside it standing, its twin-brother In conformation strange) that lifts Its verdurous tufts o'er tortuous rifts Misshapen—many a dip and rent In rock that—ever bathed, besprent With oozy hotspring, fervid play Of steam that finds a viewless vent— Is softening slow to pallid clay. By isles—mere knots of waving grass, By thin-spread rush and reed they pass; And fright a thousand birds that rise From bubbling channel, heated marsh; And flee in flocks away, with cries Now plaintive—wild, now hoarse and harsh; Coot, teal and that rich gallinule Of velvet violet plumage proud; That, night and day, each open pool Or warm and watery covert crowd; And stalk and strut and peer and pry With jerking tail and searching eye; Or plash and paddle, duck and dive, And through green bills quick-gargling drive The scooped-up Lake's clear lymph. And see, Pink-legged, snow-white or sable-pied, Those strangers from far Ocean's side; Bluff oyster-catcher, avocet, And tripping beach-birds, seldom met Elsewhere—come hither, not for food, But on this warm delight to brood, This tepid inland luxury. VI. The pair have left the light canoe And cross the soil with cautious tread, Whose treacherous crust they scarce can trust— Each step, it seems, may break it through. With springy swelling moss 'tis spread, An emerald, warm, and soaking sod, In places; then their way they track Through little thickets, very black In shade against the tumbled blocks, The steaming, white and moonlit rocks; But cherished there to richness rare Of fragrant broom and ferny plume And winding woven lycopod Close-creeping—all luxuriant, lush, In that pervading vapour-gush. Then on a grassy spot the brake Left free—just large enough to make A couch for two, fenced all around With aromatic leptosperm— A soft green gapless wall—they heap Elastic fern and broom to keep Down to a pleasant warmth the heat The ground gives out; where they may sleep— Could Love desire a bower more sweet?— Secure no noxious reptiles creep Throughout the land—envenomed worm Or poison-snake you dread to meet: And lulled by that low changeless churme, The hissing, simmering, seething sound That sings and murmurs all the while And ever round that mystic isle; May sleep a blissful sleep profound, Plunged in the calm unconscious heaven To youth and health out-wearied given. Canto the Sixth. A Geyser Yoked. 1. Warm baths. 2. More hotsprings and clay-pools. A pea-green tarn. 3. The rosy fountain-stairs and alabaster rock. 4. Geysers still. An emerald font. 5. Amo's notions of travelling. 6. The Roaring Geyser. Steam yoked. 7. A real Atua. I. Soon as the Morn from curtain-folds of grey Peeped out with smile so grave and tender, Like a young Queen upon her crowning-day Blushing to put on all that gold and splendour— Up rose the lovers to survey The marvels yet unseen that round them lay. Baths beauteous, statelier than of old Rome's silken Emperors ever planned, Of every nice degree of heat and cold, Are ready crystal-filled at hand! No need have they of fuel or fire To cook their morning meal to their desire; 'Tis but to scrape a primrose-tinted seam, Some sulphur-crusted fissure dry That runs through fern and grass hard by— Up comes the hot and fizzing steam, Wherein—or plunged in water boiling blue, The food suspended is without ado In style as wholesome quickly drest As Savarin's choicest, Soyer's best. II. Forthwith their gladsome way they take To all the marvels of the Lake. To Wáta-poho's endless wail They list—the groans its tortures wrest From its hard agonizing breast, So hollow, inward-deep and fierce, As upward shoot its showers intense, Cramming the narrow shaft they pierce Through shuddering rocks blanched ashy-pale; Hot water, steam and sulphur-smoke Commingling in one column dense Of white terrific turbulence! But other gentler feelings woke Its sister-fountain welling nigh Whose bursts of grief for moments brief Long-intervalled, in streams outbroke, And then would sink away and die With such soft moan relapsing slow— Such long-drawn breath of utter woe— It well became its mournful name, ‘Ko-ingo’—‘Love's desponding Sigh.’ They visit then that narrow glen, Where at the foot of hills forlorn, Silicious slabs of spar flood-borne, Like cakes of ice when Spring is young, Burst up by freshets wild, are flung. And slow they pick their cautious way By liquid beds of creamy clay, Where large white nipples rise and sink, And lazy bubbles break and fume, Up to a small square tarn pea-green— As green and bright as malachite, Beneath a crimson cliff in part White-mottled, but along the brink Of that clear water's grass-hued sheen (Where azure dragon-flies will dart A moment)—feathered rich and dark With mánuka like fragrant broom. And near the valley's mouth they mark, Where thickets dense scarce leave a track, A boiling mud-pool sputtering black And baleful;—mark, above its gloom What weird wild shapes the rocks assume! Here, worn by water's sapping might, Time-crennelled turrets half o'erthrown; There, idols blurred by ages' flight To shapes of unconjectured stone; Now on the hill's low brow upright, Like men who walk in dreams by night, Dumbfounded, tottering—lost and lone; Now, muffled forms their faces shrouding Opprest with some unheard-of doom; Or woe-struck up the hillside crowding— Funereal mourners round a tomb:— Grotesque and ominous and grim, As Doré's wonder-teeming whim E'er forged and fixed in stony trance Of subtle-shaped significance. III. And next across the Lake they steer To see that fair cascaded stair That yester-eve they passed so near— ‘The Fountain of the Clouded Sky,’ Tu-kápua-rangi—fitly styled, It flings its steam so wide and high. 'Tis rosy rime they climb this time; For floors and fringes, terrace piled O'er terrace, glow with faint carmine As fashioned of carnelian fine; As if, continuous, full, from heaven Some wide white avalanche downward driven Came pouring out of Sunset, stained With sanguine hues it still retained. But at the topmost terrace—lo, A vision like a lovely dream!— A basin large, its further marge And surface slightly veiled with steam That thinly driving o'er it flies, Spreads, level with the level plain Of smoothest milk-white marble grain: And broad all round that basin's brink A double stripe—one delicate pink— One lemon-yellow—bordering dyes That whiteness, and with even hues, Fair as a rainbow laid on snow, Its wavy outline still pursues. But through the driving vapour, see, Translucent depths of azure, bright And soft as heaven's divinest blue— A gulf profound of liquid light! And from those depths, uprising through That azure light—yet all beneath The steaming surface—still as death, In snowy mute solemnity, A mighty forward-bending peak Of marble bows; shaped like a paw, Say, some enormous polar bear's, Thick-set with many a flattened claw, All one way level-pointing—scale O'er scale like th' Indian pangolin's mail— All snowiest alabaster!—Weak, Too weak, were any words to speak The hushed mysterious charm it wears, That ghostly-lovely miracle, Whose sides of snow far down below In boiling light that round them lies, Fade where the clear cerulean glow Of that unfathomed fervent well In tenderest turquoise dimness dies! O well may Ranolf for a while Enthusiast-like, sit rapt before That heaven-blue gulf and rock snow-white, Unconscious even of Amo's smile, Unconscious of her joyous eyes, And loving arms he scarce could feel That softly would around him steal As silent by his side she lay On that pure speckless snowy floor With pink and saffron purfle gay. IV. Thus all the varied fountains found Among the ferny hills that bound Mahana, and a mile around,— Of every flow and hue and sound They visit;—tall columnar mound And diamond-cone, and haycock-heap Of boiling snow, and springs that leap And languish, spurting fitful spray, And cloud-crowned stems of steam that spout At seasons, or shoot up alway; Hid white about this verdurous waste Like statues in proud gardens placed. And one large font whose hollow bed With branching emerald coral spread, Through brilliant boiling crystal spied, Looks daintiest moss green-petrified! And sights as dread they meet throughout, As wild Imagination's worst Of black hell-broths and witches' bowls Infernal—Dante-pits accurst, Here realized in cankerous holes And sloughs of mud as red as blood, Pitch-black, or viscid yellow-drab, Or pap of clay light-bluish gray, Or sulphurous gruel thick and slab: Each sputtering, hot, commixture dire, Earth mineral-stuffed, and flood and fire, Together pashed and pent-up make, And fuse in sluggish fever nought can slake. So passed the day; and swiftly sped Mid scenes where marvels ever varying rise; The wanderers' eyes with wonder ever fed— Bright with continual flashes of surprise. V. Late after noon it was, when tired the pair Returning to their starting point, once more Beside the mighty geyser stood That flings a panting column high in air— ‘Ohápu’—‘Fountain of the dreadful Roar.’ Their fancy sated with the sight of fear, They sate upon the hill above That cauldron, in the shade of rocky wood By bursting spring and boiling flood Distorted;—sate in lounging mood In careless converse, to themselves how dear! (Is any talk too trifling for true love?) Where still the Geyser's raging they could hear. —“This loitering through the land on foot, Now slow, now faster, as may suit One's humour best, I do enjoy So thoroughly—did always from a boy!”— Said Ranolf, as himself he threw Upon the stunted fern—“Do you?” “On foot!” said Amo, “how else could you go? Though in your land, I've heard, indeed, That travellers sometimes go at greater speed In strangest style—I ne'er believed it, though.” “What did you hear, my Amo?” “It was he E Ruka, who had sailed beyond the sea; But he so many monstrous stories told With face so true, by young and old ‘Kai-títo-nui’ he was named, ‘The big lie-swallower;’ ‘pumpkin-headed’ too, To take whate'er he heard for true— They called him. I should be ashamed His silly solemn stories to repeat.” “But let me hear about the travelling, sweet!” “Well, promise not to laugh—at least, not laugh Too much at me. I did not credit half The story, mind. He said, your people use To travel in, great land-canoes, Dragged by enormous dogs as tall As men, or taller; nay, more strange— A thing that had to do with travel, Though how, I could not quite unravel— That beasts about your country range To which the mighty Moas were small Our songs make mention of; that these Gigantic monsters, each and all Have double heads and shoulders double, Six legs or so; and therefore go Swift as the wind; then without trouble Can split in two whene'er they please, And both the fragments when they sever, Can run about as well as ever!— Nay, now, but I will hold your lips— You are not to laugh so—understand; I will not take away my hand, Kiss as you may my finger-tips.” The fact explained to her well nigh As wondrous as the fiction seemed: What! get astride those beasts and fly! 'Twas like what Maui did or schemed, Who fished the Isles up—almost hitched The Sun into his noose, and then Had freed the happy sons of men From Night—Death—every denizen Of Darkness—all the evil crew Of powers bewitching or bewitched. VI. “My Child—but these are trifles to The wondrous things our people do.—” He pointed toward the place where bellowing, crashing, That fierce terrific Hotspring raged; With monstrous head in furious foam upsoaring, And boiling billows round the crater dashing, Its crusted soot-brown sides like demons lashing; Or if a moment from its maddest mood The lapsing Geyser seemed to sink assuaged, Mounting again amid the ceaseless roaring, Like hissing Cobra with inflated hood Upswelling swift—its reeking rush renewing, With force and frenzy evermore accruing! “You hear,” he said, “that hell-pool dread: What would you think if I should say My people have the skill to yoke The fiercest whirls of steam that ever broke From that tremendous pit of wrath, and tether As many moving houses gay Behind it, as would all your tribe contain; Then make it whisk them o'er the plain, Aye! all your Tribe at once together, As smoothly, rapidly as flew The Kingfisher the other day With chestnut breast and back so blue That round our heads came swooping, screaming, Because we chanced to saunter near The barkless twisted tree-trunk (gleaming In sunshine silver-sharp and clear Against far purple hills) that hid The nest wherein his young ones lay?” “Well, but if such a word you spoke I could but think, I could but say, 'Twas my Ranoro's whim to joke; And on her fond reliance play Who takes and trusts his every word, As if an Atua's voice she heard.” “Nay; pretty one! 'tis simple fact— No silly jest, but truth exact.” “Well, then, my Chief, my Master dear Shall do as I, his handmaid, bid, And let me all the wonder hear.” “Your language has no words, I fear—” “Ah, we poor Maori! worthless still, In deeds and words, no power, no skill!— But tell me—that tremendous flying Is it not something dreadful, frightful Your people tremble at, while trying?” “Not dreadful, dearest, but delightful—” And then with her request complying, “See—” he went on, as best he could, constraining Strange words and strange ideas to fit— Though all the interruptions we omit Where foreign thought or phrase required explaining:— “See! all in order ranged at hand The moving houses ready stand; Your tribe all ranged in order too, Inside them sit—imagine how; We take our places, I and you—” (“Yes—were I close to you as now!”—) “Impatient frets the giant, Steam,— You hear his wild complaining scream; You hear him hissing ere he start Like pinned-down Snake that strives to dart; Then off at once! in perfect row Swift as a lance your warriors throw, Men, houses, all, away we go!— Give place! give place! in silent race The distant woods each other chase! Trees, hedges, hamlets—far and wide, They reel and spin, they shift and slide! The dim horizon all alive— Hills, plains and forests, how they drive! Determined to keep up and see They shoot ahead as fast as we: But nearer objects, soon as spied, Detach themselves and backward glide, Behind us drifting one by one; Wink past the others and are gone! See! parallel field-furrows broad That lie right-angled to the road, Like swiftly-turning wheel-spokes play— Turn—open—float and flit away! More speed—more speed! and shriller cries! The panting road begins to rise, And like a whirling grindstone flies! The fields close by can scarce be seen, A swift continuous stream of green!— —But fix upon the scene around A steadier glance—in how profound A stillness seems that hamlet bound: How solemn, in secluded meadows Those oak trees standing on their shadows; That church-tower wrapt in ivy-fleece, How sacred its inviolate peace! The riot of our wild career Seems rushing through a land asleep Where all things rapt—entranced, appear, Or if they move, can only creep; The lightest car, the heaviest wain— (Those land-canoes, you know, we use) And walking men whose figures plain A moment on the eye remain, Seem toiling backwards, all in vain!— Then sudden—close—ere you can think, The blackest blinding midnight seems To make your very eyeballs shrink; The air is dank—a hollow roar And deeper, harsher than before Is mingled with the Giant's screams, As—all the houses in a row— Right through a Mountain's heart we go! But swiftly from the jaws of night Emerging, screeching with delight, Outcomes with unabated might The Monster and pursues his flight! In snowy stream thick-issuing flies His furious breath across the skies: Each labourer as the ponderous whirr, The hammer-beats, incessant, strong, And fast as flap of flying bird, The monster's eager pulse, are heard, Suspends the busy fork or prong And turns to look, but scarce can see The phantom, ere the rush and stir, Men, monster, long-linked houses, we— All smoothly thundering, tearing on, A human hurricane—are gone!”— VII. She listened with rapt lips asunder, And rounded eyes of brilliant wonder: Love lent her Faith—nor could she draw Distinctions nice between what broke Or did not break, the natural law; But could she, 'twould have been the same; Not what was said, but he who spoke Made what she heard as what she saw. That cloudy madness chained and curbed— And all her Tribe turned undisturbed Into a screeching bird that flew Unchecked the yielding Mountains through! What myth could daunt her after that? What miracle could Superstition name Were not beside it commonplace and flat— To stagger her belief, too tame?— “These foreigners,” she smiled, “'tis true, Whate'er they wish, their Atuas do!” “An Atua—yes! divine not dread—” (But this was rather thought than said) “Could I but make her understand How this benignant Genie grand, In form so fierce, in deeds so bland, Is toiling still o'er sea and land With might unwearied and unworn By slow degrees to raise Mankind; Bestowing god-like powers, designed For mightier millions yet unborn, To wrest her plenteous treasure-horn From Nature's wise reluctant hand; Consigning so to second place The Body's too absorbing claims; Clearing the ground for higher aims; Wiping the tears from Man's sad face; Amalgamating every race— Creating Time—destroying Space.” Canto the Seventh. English Maidens. 1. Return to the great Terraces. Amo asks about English maidens; 2. Their dress and jewels. 3. Amo mortified. Ranolf's idea of her. 4. Hers of him. The Parthenon. 5. The boiling pool; its blue surface colouring the mist-cloud above it. 6. The singing Islet again. I. Now to the Fountain-Stair beside the pass, The great white Fount, the pair their footsteps turning Paused to admire the baths, whose sheets of glass, Warm azure, with the blushing west were burning; And Amo when her simple phrase had told The simple triumph that illumed Her features at her friend's delight Which seemed to say her country had one sight At least, as lovely, it must be avowed, As any in his native land so proud— The talk where it had broken off resumed: “Atuas or not—you must be wise and bold To work the wonders you unfold; Too ignorant, alas! or dull Am I, O friend, to comprehend Such things, I fear. But let me hear—” She said, in somewhat faltering tone As shy, lest what she asked make known More feelings than she cared to own: “Are not your Maidens beautiful?” “More so than well my tongue can tell.” “But not more beautiful than you—” “Than I!” with laughter loud, he cried: “As much more as the graceful crane In dainty plumes without a stain Than her brown-mottled brother harsh, The booming bittern of the marsh; As much more as the fragrant strings Of milky stars I've seen you tear From some great forest-galaxy With their sweet snows to double-dye The sable splendour of your hair, Than that vile twine of prickles fine Which if it touch you cuts and clings Whene'er you push through briar and bush.” “But O, describe them, dearest, do!” “Nay, how portray, how paint or say What deep enchantment round them lies— Great Nature's last felicities, Her happiest strokes of genius! some of whom— Heart, mind and body, in the May And melody of perfect bloom The coldest sceptic must assume The mighty Master fashioned to display In one consummate work how he Could make its outward form a shrine, A visible symbol and a sign Of what was throned within—divine! Aye! spite of Man's idolatry, For ever pardonably prone To worship more the shrine than Saint, And feel from love of that alone His beauty-burthened Spirit grow With too much adoration faint— Resolved in that rare Form to show For what the rarer Soul was given,— To be to Man a living light And lure of spiritual beauty bright, To lead him on from height to height Of self-denying Love to heaven!— But who that outward Shrine can paint, Whose mortal scarce can its immortal shroud! What lofty-passioned words and tones Can picture forth those loveliest ones! So blossom-cheeked, so heavenly-browed, With dowry of divinest eyes, Twin fragments of the azure skies Beaming celestial blessing through Pure chastened lids whose perfect white, And the transparent temples too, Are stained with streaks of delicate blue As tender as thick-fallen snow Deep down in crack and crevice makes With its own shadow, when the weight Of piled-up frail congealment breaks.— Their hair! O take when Morning wakes Her beams and twine them! pleach and plait The Moon-sparks shrinking, leaping, linking, On yonder Lake at midnight—spin them With all the liquid gold within them Into fine skeins of splendour! so You best may guess how tress on tress In long luxuriant glossiness Its gleaming undulations flow!— But you should see—I cannot tell— What they resemble who so well Attest what truth of fancy nurst Your native myth how Woman first Was fashioned from comminglings sweet Of brilliant tremors of the noontide heat That shimmering near you, still retreat, And airy Echoes, sprites so shy Yet quick with answering sympathy, That ever haunting ever hide Near cliff abrupt and mountain-side;— With just enough of added Earth To temper charms of such ethereal birth, Which else e'en Rapture's self would miss— Which else its fond embrace would fly— To something lovelier it can clasp and kiss!”— II. “And have they flaxen mantles fair As this—with broidered border rare? And do their greenest jewels shine Like this pellucid jade of mine?” “For dress they rob the sunset—take Its gorgeous glisterings from the Lake, Or swathe their forms in gauzy mist The Moon might envy them at night, Pavilioned with pure amethyst, In pearliest virgin vesture dight! And as for gems!—they wreathe about Their arms that dazzle you without, And necks, that when your eyes you shut, Leave shapes of sinuous snowy bloom In vivid loveliness clear cut And floating on the purple gloom— Such trails of richest radiance set In linked array of flower and fret, As if they strung the beaded clusters, The little lamping flame-hued lustres, Sapphires winking, rubies blinking, Trembling emerald-sparks, adorning The mist-besilvered meads of morning When first the Sun new-fires them! Aye And always had that Sun hard by To keep them, as his only duty, Still bristling with all hues of beauty!”— III. But while he spoke there stole unseen O'er Amohia's frank bright face A shadow—as a slow white cloud Grows over all the blue sky-space Left by an opening in the green O'er-roofing forest thick-emboughed, And sheds soft gloom where light but now was shining. He marked the mournful drooping head, The cheek where sadly-pensive spread The long-curled lashes low-declining: “Yet,” said he quickly, “few of those Have such a faultless form as you, Whose every facile movement shows What perfect grace on perfect limbs The perfect freedom from restraint bestows; Few such a blithe bright bearing; few Could bound as is your wont Up the great mountain-side and chase The shadow of the cloud that skims Scarce fleeter in its flying race; Or at the summit could confront The bland magnificence of Nature's brow With such superb and regal innocence And look and mien so kindred! few have eyes Of such a brilliant power They take away your breath and burn Right through your heart whene'er they turn Their melting flashes on you! few could shower Such silky breadths of darkness down as now I hold between me and their gaze, To see if still their brightness will Come breaking through in spurry rays Like evening sunbeams through a thicket dense! Yes! howsoe'er those beings fair With Art to aid and Culture's care From human almost to divine may rise, For charms like these, not many there Could with my Wonder of the Wilds compare!” IV. The sunny look at once returned, And through the clear warm brown discerned, The blush of artless triumph burned. Then round his neck her arms she threw And gazed, with love how fond and true As upon something to adore, Upon the face above her; in that vein When parted lips and anxious sigh confess Content is at its highest, and the excess Of pleasure trembles on the brink of pain; With simplest admiration too Reading his features o'er and o'er, As if her eyes could never feed Enough, nor sate her heart's impassioned greed For what to her was beautiful indeed: ‘Kai-máta’—‘face-devouring gaze’ Her country's own poetic phrase Had called the glance that so much love displays. But how conceive her feeling? how The picture fond her fancy drew, The halo round his form she threw! To that enamoured fancy, quite Unused to the fair-tinted faces Of our Caucasian northern races, This Stranger, with his eyes of sparkling blue That shone through shadows of a thoughtful brow Embossed with Intellect, and full and white, With clustered gold about it curled, Seemed some high Being from another World! August and beautiful and bright To her he well might seem, As you perchance would deem Some Phidian Temple must have looked of old; Where architrave and pediment arise, With metope-squares of dauntless proud emprise, And friezes full of life!—serenely bold Broadly confronting the broad skies, And throwing deep majestic shade (As human brow o'er human eyes) Into the interspaces made By many a stately colonnade;— As such a Temple must have looked when bare Its snowy grace and lovely grandeur first Upon the shouting people burst! Its solemn charm that would have awed, almost In the mere splendour of material lost; Because so brilliant fresh and new, So delicately tinted here and there With rainbow colours pure and fair, The sculptured Marvel stood in view; The matchless groups around it rife In stirring trance of pomp or strife, Sharp from some famous chisel, every one; The marble dust of recent working In glittering specks about them lurking; All just uncovered to the morning Sun! V. But fair as Phidian Temple tinged so purely, That pure untinged white-terraced Fount corálline Showed, with its baths cerulean and crystálline, Whereon they gazed when not upon each other Their lover-gaze delightedly was dwelling; When looks, where Love was seated so securely, To answering looks ceased passionately telling The tide of tenderness each bosom swelling. Then, as they watched the huge Steam-cloud that whitely O'er the main pool, like some nest-brooding mother, Spread swanlike wings the brilliant water shading,— Enveloped and imparadised more brightly In a Love-cloud as fervid and unfading, They saw how richly, though from surface duller, That still, suspended Mist reflected duly The bubbling basin's amethystine colour; Returning tint for lovely tint as truly As in their mirrored eyes, fond, deep, untroubled, They marked, upwelling ever freshly, newly, Their mutual Love reflected and redoubled! VI. Then to the glen that fronts the islets twain And to their isle itself they come— That ever-singing isle—through all the train Of water-birds that swarm the simmering plain, Thick as the sower's air-scattered grain. And then their bower of mánuka they gain Already soothing with a sense of home. The grateful viands follow, fountain-drest; And then that churme monotonous, ne'er represt, Lulls them again entranced to Love's Elysian rest. BOOK THE FIFTH. STILL IN EDEN. Canto the First. The Haunted Mountain. 1. Amo fears to ascend the Mountain—Tára-wéra. 2. A tree-girt niche. 3. The Mountain. 4. Morning and songsters. 5. The Lake. I. “Shall we run into the cloudlet, love, so luminous and white That is crouching up in sunshine there on yonder lofty height? We could step out of the splendour all at once into the mist— Such a sunny snowy bower where a maiden might be kissed! From the woody lower terrace we could climb the russet steep O'er that chasm gorged with tree-tops still in shadow dewy-deep, Where another slip of vapour, see! against the purple black, Set on fire by the sunbeam which has caught it there alone, Like a warrior-chief inciting his adherents to attack, Has upreared itself upright with one imperious arm outthrown! Up that slope so smooth and ruddy we could clamber to the crags To the jutting rim of granite where the crouching cloudlet lags: In and out the bright suffusion up above there in the skies, I would follow my fleet darling by the flashing of her eyes, O'er that lofty level summit, as they vanished vapour-veiled, Or would glitter out rekindling and then glance away to seek, Like swift meteors seen a moment, for some other silver streak— Now bedimmed and now bedazzling till each dodge and double failed, And I caught her—O would clasp her! such delicious vengeance wreak On those eyes—the glad, the grand ones! on that laughter-dimpled cheek, Till with merciless caresses the fine damask flushed and paled, And half-quenched in burning kisses those bewitching lustres quailed!” “Nay, but Rano, my adored one—O my heart and soul's delight! Scarce with all your love to lead me—fold me round from all affright— Would I dare ascend that Mountain! woody cleft and fissure brown Are so thick with evil spirits—it has such a dread renown! Such a hideous Lizard-Monster in its gloomy shades it screens, That as rugged as the rocks are, winds along the close ravines— E'en asleep lies with them sinuous like a worm in twisted shell— And has eaten up more people in old days than I can tell! Would you go and wake that Taniwha! O not at least to-day: Look how lovely calm the Lake is!—'twill be sweeter far to stray In the blue hot brilliant noon-tide to each secret shadowy bay, And afloat on liquid crystal pass the happy time away!”— II. So he, who when he had his will, For pleasure always went up hill, So Ranolf spoke; and so replied His wildwood bride, the diamond-eyed, When morning's beam began to burn, Up-springing from their couch of fern By charming Tára-wéra's side. A little plot of smooth green grass— By tapering trees thick-set and tall Beneath grey rocks that rose o'er all, Shut in behind—a verdurous wall Circling that lawny flat so small Down to the very water's edge, That spread in front its liquid glass;— Not far from where, 'mid reed and sedge, The warm Mahana's rapid tide, A mile-long stream scarce six feet wide, Comes rushing through the open pass— As seeks a hot and fevered child Its Mother's bosom cool and mild— To Tára-wéra's ample Lake; This shallow niche, tree-girt and green, With nought its still sweet charm to break, The lovers' lonely bower had been. III. In sunshine stretching lightly o'er The Lake's far end from shore to shore, Long stripes of gauze-like awning lay— In stripes serene and white as they, Re-imaged on its bright blue floor. And many a rocky rugged bluff, With crimson-blossoming boscage rough O'er beetling crest and crevice flung,— White cliff or dark-green hill afar With patches bleached of scarp and scar— Stood boldly forward sunrise-fired, Or back in sun-filled mist retired. Untrembling, round the glistening rim Of that expanse of blooming blue, From headland bright or inlet's brim, Long fringes of reflection hung. Its ramparts stretched along the sky, One mighty Mountain reared on high Far o'er the rest a level crest, With jutting rounded parapet And rude rock-corbels rough-beset, Half-blurred by time and tempest's fret; While smooth its slopes came sweeping down From that abraded cornice brown. The mountain this, the ruddy steep, That Ranolf, sun-awaked from sleep, So longed to scale; and high in air In glad imagination share Its sky-possessing majesty Of haughty isolation!—there Into each dark recess to pry And every sight and secret see Its lofty level might reveal, Or those grim fissures' depths conceal, That split the Mountain into three. IV. About the heights, soft clouds a few, Clung here and there like floating flue; Like helpless sea-birds breeze-bereft, Unmoving spread their pinions white— From jutting crag, deep-bathed in light, To slip away in snowy flight; Or closely crouched in shadowy cleft, Like lambing ewes the flock has left. Below, o'erjoyed at darkness fleeing, Reviving Nature woke again To all the exceeding bliss of being! The minnows leapt the liquid plain In shoals—each silvery-shivering train, A sudden dash of sprinkled rain! The wild-duck's black and tiny fleet Shot in-and-out their shy retreat; The cormorant left his crowded tree And stretched his tinselled neck for sea; All Nature's feathered favourites poured To their adored undoubted Lord Of light and heat, accordance sweet Of pure impassioned revelry; And honey-bird and mocking-bird And he of clearest melody, The blossom-loving bell-bird,—each Delicious-throated devotee In happy ignorance framed to be Content with rapture—longing-free For life or love they cannot reach— Like chimes rich-tuned, to heaven preferred The praise of their mellifluous glee! Each lurking lyrist of the grove With all his might sung all his love; Till every foliage-filled ravine And bower of amaranthine green Rang persevering ecstasy! V. With free elastic hearts that shone In joy as fresh as morning's own— Each seated in a light canoe The kind Lake-villagers supplied— Amo's the lighter—gayer too, With snowy tufts of feathers tied In rows along each ruddy side,— The pair went paddling, fancy-led; For here no wond'rous sights of dread Or beauty lurked to guide their quest As at Mahana—nothing strange, Or out of Nature's wonted range. Yet Ranolf marked with lively zest What charms the changeful scene possest: The billowy-tumbling hills—the crags— The smooth green slopes fern-carpeted; Low cliffs with feathery foliage graced; Rock-palisades emerging pale And grey; and precipices faced With head-stones—close-set armour-scale Of gothic-pointed bristling flags; Flat islets crowned with wood—cliff-bound; And lake-side bowers and canopies; And caves and grottoes within these! And lichened rocks that singly stand Detached from green umbrageous land, Mere pedestals for single trees; Or, jutting out with jagged arms All plumed and fair with greenery, bear Into the Lake the forest's charms; And with the bank that proudly swells, A wooded wall without a strand, Make niches, nooks, and liquid cells, With interlacing boughs o'erspanned. Canto the Second. Sports on the Lake. 1–3. A water-chase. Amo in different characters popular in Maori mythology and fable. 4. A disappearance, and (5) an alarm. 6. Her love. I. The mists were gone—the sun rode high; The pair went paddling merrily Each bay and cove and nook to try; In loving converse sauntering slow Or darting swiftly to and fro, Except for pleasure, purposeless As minnow-crowds whose sinuous stream Meandering through the azure gleam Darkened the watery depths below. It chanced the boats a moment lay With prows that pointed both one way, Amo's ahead a little space: A sudden whim lit up her face; Then, as a challenge for a race, She chaunted, ere away she sped, With laughing frowns of loving spite, Set teeth and sideways-shaken head, Mock words of bitter-sweet delight: “I am Hátu! I'm Hátu! poor boy of the glen Whom the wicked witch-giantess hid in her den! And you are the Giantess hoarding her prize With her terrible claws—O such hideous eyes! But I've fled from caresses I . . . hate, O so much! Escaped from her loathsome, her horrible touch— From her dreadful . . . dear! . . . clutches escaped to the plain, And I dare, I defy her, to catch me again!”— II. Then paddling off with all her might, Away across the lake she flew, And left a wake of foam snow-bright, And broadening ripple glassy-blue; While, dashing after, less expert Soon Ranolf finds he must exert His utmost skill to catch her, too. But when, though less by skill than strength, He nears her flying skiff at length— With nimble paddle, dodging back She slips off on another tack, With swiftly-flitting noiseless ease; As—when some fisher thinks to seize With gently-dropped and stealthy spear A flounder, down in shallows clear, 'Mid mottling tufts of dusky weeds And white sand-patches where it feeds— The trembling shadow shifts away Through faintly-shimmering water grey— 'Tis there—and gone—his would-be prey! So, hovering round with wistful eyes, While many a feint, to cheat, surprise, That merry mocker, Ranolf tries, She, at a little distance staying, And watchful, with the paddle playing, No move of his, no glance to miss— Now darts alert that way, now this; And at each foiled attempt again Provokes him in alluring strain: “Look! I'm one of those divine ones—joy and love of all beholders, Who had pinions, O such fine ones! growing from their stately shoulders; Not that fond one too confiding—so in vain your bright eyes watch me— He, the last on earth residing . . . Ah! you need not think to catch me! . . . Who, beside his loved-one lying, let the Maid while he was sleeping, Press his wings off, spoil his flying,—lest he e'er should leave her weeping!”— III. Then off she skims in circuit wide, Resolved another plan to try, Again with paddles swiftly plied, Again across the lake they fly; And as her little bark he nears, A new defiance Ranolf hears: “I'm Wákatau, he— That Child of the Sea! And my dearest delight Is flying my kite. Down beneath, on the sand, With the string in my hand, Under water I stand; Or the kite in the air, Like the day-moon up there, Like an albatross strong, Draws me swiftly along As I float to and fro On the green sea below.— Apakúra, my mother, Can catch me, none other; From the quickest alive, Down—down—would I dive!— Whoever you be— Though fonder, though dearer, You, you are not she, Apakúra, O no!— So if you come nearer, See—down I must go!” IV. Scarce on the gunwale had he laid His hand, and scarce the words were said, Ere, slipping from her loosened dress, Her simple kilt and cloak of flax,— Just as a chestnut you may press With careful foot ere ripened well, Shoots from its green and prickly shell, With tender rind so tawny-clean And dainty-pure and smooth as wax,— She shot into the blue serene; A moment gleamed, then out of sight, Swift as a falling flash of light! All round he seeks with anxious mien The Naiad—nowhere to be seen. A fearful time he seems to spy— His heart beats quick—when lo, hard by, A mermaid! risen on the rocks, Whose diamond glances archly play Through shaken clouds of glittering locks, And glancing showers of diamond-spray: “You are not Apakúra! O, no, no, not you!” She cries—and dives beneath the blue. He follows, watching where she glides Beneath a drooping pall profound Of boughs, that all the water hides. Into the gloom he pushes: sound Or sight of her is none around. But hark!—'twas somewhere near the bank That sudden plash! it takes his ear As startlingly as sometimes, near A stream where June's hot grass is rank, You hear the coiled-up water-snake Your unsuspecting footsteps wake, Flop down upon the wave below, And wabbling through the water go. Again to the mid lake she hies; In swift pursuit again he flies: And see! she waits with face, how meek! Till he can touch and almost clasp, The shining shoulders, laughing cheek; Then, diving swift, eludes his grasp: Just as, with quick astonished eye, A wild-duck waits, until well-nigh The ruddy-curled retriever's snap Is gently closing like a trap On its poor neck and broken wing, Before with sudden jerk she dips, Beneath the ripple vanishing. From Ranolf so the Maiden slips. V. But when, the chase renewed, he nears The spot where next she reappears, Look! floating on the glass she lies With close-sealed lips and fast-shut eyes, Still as a Saint in marble bloom Carved snowy-dead upon a tomb. Close to her side his skiff he steers: “O Swallow of the waters fleet, O wild lake-bird! my Swift, my sweet, My lovely-crested Grebe! at last, I catch, I kiss, I hold you fast!” He takes that slender hand of hers; She answers not—nor looks—nor stirs; Surprised, her listless arm he shakes— She neither stirs—looks up—nor wakes. “Speak, speak, my Amo! what is this! Do you not feel my clasp, my kiss? Do you not hear my voice?” —Ah no! That low sad moan no answer gives: She breathes—but heavy, stertorous, slow; That breathing barely shows she lives. He felt her heart—it faintly pulsed; At times she shudders as convulsed; “Yes, it must be! the hot, high sun Has struck her, dear one; too opprest, With such exertions quite o'erdone!” Alarmed—reflecting what were best, He soon resolves, and does it too. Beneath each arm with tenderest care, He twines a tress of streaming hair, And knots them both with double turn, Rich-volumed to his own canoe— The open carved work of the stern: Then tows her senseless till they reach The nearest stripe of sandy beach: There leaps ashore—seeks—breaks in half, A cockle-shell—'twill answer well: Then finds and feels the corded vein That crosses with its azure stain The tender hollow of her arm, And soon will wake the life-tide warm. But ere the shell's sharp point can wound— Just ere it pricks her—from the ground, Upleaping with a silvery laugh, The cheat confessed, she darts away, (Snatching her mantle up that lay In Ranolf's boat, which he had thrown Into it as she left her own) And to a thicket near has flown— Swift—sudden-glancing as a bird The loud flirt of whose wing is heard A moment, on the hot wood-side, As, brushing out and in again, A scarlet gleam, you see him glide, Lancing his dodging flight; even so Does Amo still the chase maintain; And Ranolf follows, with mock-angry show Of mirthful vengeance, fondly-threatening cries, And chastisements that are caresses in disguise. VI. Thus ever and anon, this buoyant Child, Free as the winds and as the waters wild, With wayward whims the time beguiled: Thus would the tranquil tenor of her joy Still quicken into rapids of delight; And break meandering into branches bright Of manifold emotions that would rove Diversely, but to give redoubled force And sweet variety to one sure course— Spreading and sparkling only to unite In one broad current of unfailing Love. Such simple arts would she employ To tamper with, and tease, and toy With her delight, its depth to prove; With sportive sallies, sly disguises, Arch mockeries—mimicries—surprises: So on her heart impress a sense More varied, vivid and intense Of bliss all golden-pure without alloy, And Love no time could cool, no fond fruition cloy! Canto the Third. The Cicada. 1. The Lake-bower. The ‘Downy Ironheart’ Tree. 2. The hamper. Native fruits, etc. 3. ‘Eating the tables.’ 4. Dragon-flies. 5. The Cicada suggests old Athenians. 6. Insect-transformations: what by analogy deducible from them? 7. Cicada's joyous song. How Ranolf interprets it. As the blank beyond its comprehension is filled with the wonders of Science, etc., visionary to it; so something—and what but higher Spirit-Life?—must fill the blank beyond ours. Better than speculation the joyous trustfulness of its old friend Anacreon. I. 'Tis burning Noon: from heat and glare How sweet the bower the lovers share! A Lakeside cleft—a rock-recess Of soft sun-chequered quietness, A nook for lovers made express. Like birds in some umbrageous tree Girt round with leaves they seemed to be, A hollow globe of greenery: For twisting, arching, overhead Dark serpentining stems were spread; And arching, twisting, down below, Stems serpentining seemed to grow; While on a plane of light between, Suspended lay those skiffs serene. Sunbathed arose the dome-like roof A strangely-splendid wondrous woof; Whose dark-green glistening foliage seemed Thick over-showered with shining snow, Except where blood-red masses gleamed— Such luminous crimson—all aglow! White buds and opening leaves the first, With silvery-sheening velvet lined; The last, rich-tufted bloom that burst Bright-bristling, with the sun behind; As if whole trees, 'mid heaped snow-showers Were turning into burning flowers! Below, the pair as thus in air Upbuoyed, a sight as fair enjoyed; The hollow shadowy floor, o'erlaid, Beneath the clear transparent void, With silvery-crimson soft brocade, To that above in shape and hue So like, the seeming from the true By its inversion best they knew. It was the ‘downy ironheart’ That from the cliffs o'erhanging grew, And o'er the alcove, every part, Such beauteous leaves and blossoms threw, And made this cool sequestered nest For silent, lone and loving rest. II. Then for refreshment in the noontide heat, With mockery of much ado, And lips comprest and pursed-up too, And little nods of playful pride, And self-complacent confidence to win Applause at fine arrangements so complete— As who should say: ‘Now open wide Your eyes and see how I provide!’— Fair Amo with arch mimic pomp outdrew A platted basket hid in her canoe, Cool-packed with leaves and lightly tied— A flax-green basket autumn-piled; wherein Date-like karakas made a golden show Quince-coloured and quince-smelling; faintly sweet Soft aromatic pepper-spikes were seen; Potato-apples of the poro-poro tall Rich-mellowing from their crude lip-burning green; And, bounteous 'mid these wood-gifts wild and small, Ripe, slippery-seeded and of juiciest flow, Great water-melons melting crisp with crimson snow. Nor was there lack of more substantial food, Leaf-hidden in a smaller green flax-hamper; Choice too, for appetites so young and good— As roasted wild duck, red-grey parrot stewed, And bread in its primeval form of ‘damper’— Unleavened cakes of palatable maize Well pounded by Te Manu, and well kneaded By Amo, and in hot wood-ashes clean Well baked—or rather in oven of simpler sort Than most remote ‘Stone-period’ could report— Mere flagstones laid and heated without trouble Upon a quenchless fountain's boiling bubble; Flat cakes that dish and platter superseded; And, used instead, recalled in this far scene A moment's memory of old school-boy days To Ranolf—that crab-apple-feasted crew Of Ocean-wanderers, wearily reposing In maple shadows on green sunny slopes, And watching with dim eyes and fading hopes, The sparkle of the sea-waves summer-beaded; Then fair Ascanius luckily disclosing The prophecy's fulfilment, else unheeded, “What! must we eat our very tables too!”— Nay, one more luxury swelled the savoury list— That dainty by our daintiest humourist So prized—roast sucking-pig! for two of these Nimble Te Manu had contrived to seize, Cut off by clever doubles yesternight From a long train that scampered after Their grunting dam, and, driven from her track Could not escape the youngster's clutches, though They dodged him, as disabled half by laughter, He obstinately chased them to and fro An hour at least, imprisoned as they were Between a shrunken river, and cliff chalk-white That wall-like rising at their back From the clean speckless gravel-bed upright, Without a blade of verdure, bright and bare, Made the small runaways look doubly black, Doubly conspicuous in the sunset's glare. IV. So each as in a floating nest, Moored side by side the lovers rest, And catch veiled glimpses as they lie Of splendour-flooded azure sky. The birds that sung those matins sweet Are silent now in slumberous heat. In dreamy-lighted luxury Lies Ranolf musing—marking well Each charm of water, rock and tree About that shadowy glimmering cell; The low grey cliffs with stains imbued Of lichens white and saffron-hued, Flat crumpled—or blue hairy moss; All doubled in the shimmering gloss: Sometimes a loose-furred hawkmoth, see! At those rich blossoms restlessly Fumbles to suck their anthers sweet: Sometimes, invading that retreat Great black white-banded dragon-flies— With green and gold-shot globuled eyes On either side projecting wide Like swift coach-lamps—on quivering wings Of glittering gauze dart all about; With tinier ones of richer dyes, That hover—dodge aside—and fix Themselves with those bent-elbowed legs, And heads so loose, endlong to sticks And twigs, and hold as straight as pegs Their blue or scarlet bodies out; Just as a tumbler, 'mid his tricks Seizes an upright pole and flings His particoloured legs in air, And holds them horizontal there— So proud to ape a finger-post. “They were revolting, hideous things,” Thought Ranolf, “but at least could boast A faith that made them leave in time— Come shouldering up through mud and slime With horny eyes and dull surprise, Out of the clogging element Where their first grovelling life they spent!”— —Meanwhile unseen cicadas fill The air with obstinate rapture shrill— A wide-fermenting restless hiss Proclaiming their persistent bliss; As if the very sunshine found A joyous voice—and all around, While woods and rocks and valleys rung, In brilliant exultation sung. V. And Ranolf loved—could not but prize That tiny classic Cymbalist, So graced with old Greek memories; The rapture-brimmed, rich-burnished one— His bright green corselet streaked with jet, His brow with ruby brilliants set— That, undisturbed, would ne'er desist From clicking, clattering in the sun His strident plates—at every trill Jerking with stiffly quivering thrill His glassy-roofing wings; as gay As his precursor could have been Two thousand faded years ago!— See! through thin morning vapour gray,— With snowy marble-gleams between Blue-shadowy clefts of fragrant gloom Melodious ever and alive With immemorial bees that hive In honied thickets, lilac-green With sage and thyme in deathless bloom,— Bare old Hymettus looks serene O'er silvery glimpses far below Of pure Ilyssus in swift flow Through plains—one revel of renown! And there, along the myrtle path, As fond of sunshine, full of joy, Fresh-glistening from gymnasium-bath, The hyacinth-curled bronzed Attic Boy Would steal—O trust his artless tale— Just for one luscious blossom-crown, Their pride and pet delight who hail For home that marvel-minded Town— To some hot mead where violets hid Blue round the well's white timeworn trunk Of hollow marble slightly sunk In grass about the spring that slid Slow-creeping crystal all the year: And there would find one violet More fragrant-hearted, richer yet, A lovelier-lowly dearer pride Than any that the well beside As gently shrink, as shyly peer: For see! in crocus-coloured vest And silver girdle—all her best— Worn—to beguile that Boy-love?—Nay, 'Tis Queen Athene's festal-day! With vase two-handled on her head (Pale yellow spiral-striped with red)— That slim slip of a Greek-limbed girl— Who looks so sweetly grave upon Sad news about their neighbour's son Killed—since they met, at . . . Marathon! —And there the Boy, as with a curl Slipped from the shining coil he played, In loitering chat beneath the shade By glittering gray-leaved olives made,— When War's mishaps had all been heard Around that dear one's home incurred, Vines—fruit-trees broken—fields untilled— Pet-kids and lambs for forage killed,— Would faltering tell—small need! how well That bright procession-dress became The radiant face! how sweet its smell Of rosy apples redolent Oft dropped inside its chest for scent; And how she bore, in look and pace, With what a proudly-pretty grace, That vase—though brought with childish aim To save her tripping there from blame! And then would pause a little space, Just in the act of sipping down The fig she gives him, bursting-ripe, Plump, melting-skinned, and purple-brown, To mark their little gay compeer, As hand-in-hand they draw too near, Abruptly stilling its sweet shrilling, And edging round its olive-branch, Backing and sidling out of sight Of eyes that sparkle hazel-bright, As one fond wish the Boy expresses, That chirper were but turned to gold To stick in Myrrhin's golden tresses! While not his wildest dream had told The lad, how many an age to come, In what far regions all unknown, His race's merry earthborn type Would still be singing blithe and stanch, After its own grand Muse was dumb, Its noisy greeds and glories gone! VI. So Ranolf's musing fancy strung Together olden scenes and new; Or on more dubious ventures flew, If e'er as to some bough it clung The songster's pupa-case was seen, Whence from his base life subterrene He made escape in wingèd shape— The bright transparent brittle sheath Wherein he slept his life-in-death. A suit of perfect armour, where He left it Ranolf notes it still; An open crack across the back, And lobster-claws thrown by because Superfluous found, his labour crowned; The forelegs raised—‘not as in prayer,’ Thinks he—“but work; for he too, mark! Was forced to dig with strength and skill His stout way from his dungeon dark Up to his heaven of sunshine! Thus From clogged and cramped existence fleeing, He tries a second state of being In the sphere that holds but one for us: But both his lives to us seem one Who see the changes undergone: So this life and another too, Nay, lives on lives, perhaps, of ours, May seem but one to wider view And keenlier-gifted loftier powers; The subtle links we lose pursued, The metamorphose understood. But with what pitying smile must they Look on, when with such sad array The human insects hide away Some care-worn soul-case out of sight; And weep because they cannot stay The freshwinged Soul's unfettered flight To wider spheres and new delight!— “That was the way those types to read— A fine old cheery way indeed. Will Science say remorseless?—‘Nay, You must not read them so to-day. The actual metamorphoses Foreshadowed by—akin to these, Are antenatal in mankind, Gone through already. One surmise From lingering traces undesigned Of transformations some low grade Of life sustained, ere birth displayed In nascent undeveloped Man, Might be by strictest reasoning made: That if organic Being rise Elsewhere upon the self-same plan— Continue so ascending—there Some glorious creature might be found Of frame more complex, powers more rare, In whom Man's perfect mould would be But one in its imperfect round Of embryotic stages. Try What help, what hope therein may lie!’— VII. “Well, then, methinks, that surging sea Of resonant shrill melody Rings out a thoughtless answer free, Whence one may frame a thoughtful plea: ‘O human Insect! sad Truth-seeker— Which of us two is wiser—weaker? Your senses—those deep reasoning powers You will within their bounds compress, May take a wider range than ours, How vastly wider! none the less They both are dwarfed, unspeakably Fall short of and are distanced by The infinite Reality: And all beyond their feeble reach Will doubtless seem and be for each A blank—a void—mere nothingness! O grand indeed the gains you boast, The ever deepening, widening host Of wonders Science as she presses Into the Mystery's first recesses, Works out, worms into, proves or guesses!— —Creation, like a firework splendid Ever exploding, unexpended; As endlessly it whirls and flies Still breaking into brilliancies Of stranger gleam and lovelier guise:— —Organic Nature, in its flow By inorganic guided, so Divinely from its hidden fount; Germs, gemmules, cells; upstrivings shy; And those consummate craftsmen—Chance! Environment or Circumstance— With aims so clear in harmony Combining to evolve and mould Such plastic structures manifold: Their agents, climate, fire, and frost, Food, famine, skilled to crush—uphold, Choose what had best survive or perish, The lower to check, the higher to cherish, Make progress sure at any cost! So force in falling stones, and heat And cold, can make and mar and mount From starred frost-flowers to crystalled rock, Tree, insect, bird, beast, Man complete! Though still outstands that stumbling-block Of Science—Life! her pride to shock And Matter's despot-sway to mock!— Well—as so brilliantly the blank Beyond our powers perceptive teems For you with wonders that would rank With us as visionary dreams; So surely is there something still The blank beyond your own to fill; Something unsoundable by Man, If finite reason never can The Infinite comprise or span; Yet what (a point to raise no strife) Within that blank so likely rife As mightier facts of Spirit-Life?— Dreams?—aye, but all you pray for—prize, Within that realm of vague surmise May well to loftier beings be Demonstrable reality!— O human Insect! wiser—weaker— O suicidal secret-seeker, What if you left your “proofs” alone And joined our reckless rapturous Pæan Of clear confiding trustfulness, That once so charmed the jovial Teian, Whose loves and lyre and brimming beaker Were all o'erthrown by one grape-stone That choked his life out, just as you Your life of life by laying stress On doubts perhaps as trivial too; Wresting despair with so much pain Out of a scheme not your poor brain Nor ours can compass or contain, Exhaust, unravel, or explain!’”— Canto the Fourth. A loving Questioner. 1. Amo's devotion to Ranolf. 2. Asks the wise white men's opinions as to Spirits after death. 3. Materialism. 4. Amo wants Ranolf's own opinion. I. Still side by side the lovers rest Afloat in that sequestered nest. As close to Ranolf's, Amo's head Reclined,—her silky tresses spread Beneath—beyond his own—unrolled In black abundance uncontrolled To the warm and moisture-drinking air,— A splintered sunbeam lighting there Upon his locks of amber gleamed, Which so contrasted—cushioned—seemed A moon where sable soft cloud streamed, Or golden lustrous coronet On funeral pall of velvet set. O'er rocks and trees, through light and shade His curious eyes unresting strayed; But hers were fixed upon his face, Their choicest, dearest resting-place! “O Rano—” such appeared to be The train of feelings half expressed In murmuring words that filled her breast: “Great is indeed my love for thee! It seems almost a dream, even now, These lips—these eyes—this noble brow, These locks that like the day-break shine, Are mine, O mine—all—only mine! How can I make you know and feel How much I love you! how reveal My thirst for what my heart adores, The longing of my soul for yours!— O best I love to lie awake, A lonely tender watch to keep Over my trusting own one's sleep, And think, how can my love be shown!— What can I ever do to make Myself more worthy of his own? And almost wish your welfare less That more might be the chance for me To make or mend the happiness, Health, comfort, I would have depend On me, your dearest, only friend! To do some little more of good Than just preparing clothes or food;— And I at times would almost flee Your dear caress and company, E'en when I know no need to go, Just to contrive—consider—do Some thing—some active thing for you; As if the care itself were dear As him I cared for!—all the same It is my joy to trust—revere— Look up to—as my ruler claim And sole protector, guide and guard,— Him o'er whose weal I watch and ward. So would I, with the parent's love The cherished child's affection prove; So be the mother-bird to hold The young one in her fond wing's fold, Yet nestle like the fledgeling too Beneath the breast so sheltering, true: As if—my love, my lord, my life, It were not all to be your wife!— But I can never, never have Enough of that sweet love I crave; Can never find or feign or steal Sufficient outlet to reveal The burning boundless love I feel! So could I anger—give you pain, To soothe, coax, comfort you again; Would have you sick, to nurse and tend, And deeper love that way expend Upon you; have you cruel, sweet! So might I down before you throw Myself in self-abandonment More utter—not to frustrate so The working of your full intent, But to cling to you and entreat And clasp your knees and kiss your feet And mercy with hot tears implore, Only to feel myself the more Your own—all yours—life—body—soul— On whom no shadow of control Shall check your power at any hour To wreak your wildest whim or will— To ban—to bless—to save or kill! So would I tend—implore—offend— Do anything your thoughts to fill, Share each emotion, every thrill, And bear an all-absorbing part In all the beatings of your heart! So should my Soul live, drink, and feed On yours—its ardour-kindling spring! For are you not—indeed—indeed— The gulf into whose depths I fling My all of being; plunged and tost In fathomless sweet fires, and lost In this immeasurable abyss And whirl of overwhelming bliss! Yes, yes! you know that you are this, My soul-devouring, lordly bird Of beauty! O, with plumes so fair, Such stately step, commanding air And eyes so proud and free! O whence, Whence shall I seek new life to drain, Win some existence back again, But from this heart of yours alone Which so consumes—absorbs my own!— So dearest, you conceive how thence My foolish fancy, my pretence Of drowning came; 'twas but to hear Your love in your lamenting—cheer My heart with your despair and feel The sweet sensations o'er me steal Of your fond efforts to restore And bring me back to life once more!— But had I really died to-day Think not, dear friend! my Soul set free— This ‘Wairua’—could have fled away To any realm where Spirits stray, Could ever have abandoned thee! I know, I know! distressed, forlorn, It could not from thy side be torn— Would long for—linger—only rest Near what in life it loved the best!” II. “You know it, dearest! and just now, To see you looking forth and far, As bright, soft, bold and beautiful As some outstanding steady Star, With full assurance so serene, Such radiant love upon your brow— Might make the wretch most doubting, dull, Catch confidence from yours, my queen!” “Nay, surely 'twere a little thing, My soul to yours should choose to cling; Not stay to vex, as others do, Poor wretches who may break taboo—” “So then you think, if this sweet breath Were stopped—these kindling eyes were closed— These lovely living limbs reposed In rigid, stirless, icy death, My loving Amo would not be Gone—perished—done with utterly!” “Nay, what have these to do with me— With me who speak to—love you so? How strange a fancy!—tell me then For you know all things, you white men, What course my Spirit, down below, If to that land before your own It chanced to go (I know, behind It could not, would not stay alone!) Should take with least delay to find And fly to your dear heart, and show The deep and deathless love, I know, It would be burning to bestow?”— “What can I tell you! you know more, Dearest, yourself—as much at least; Do you remember, once before I told you, love, I was no priest, No learned Tóhunga—not I—” “But tell me what your wise men say, And all about us when we die; You laughed at us, I know, that day, Too proud to give a true reply!” III. “Our wise men, Amo!—sooth to say, the most Of these, just now seem doing as one day A great white War-chief did to find a way O'er shallow sea-flats when the ford was lost. Straight through the rising tide his band he sent In all directions radiating round, Resolved to follow him who furthest went, And footing most secure the longest found. So seem our Sages wandering, all and each. Some struggle through the weltering waves and sink, Still panting for the shore they never reach; Some plod along complacently and think Already they enjoy the wished-for beach; Some crouch upon a rock-reef close at hand Whence leads no path, and swear the vaunted land Is but a film that dims the seeker's eye, A passing cloud that mocks the groping band; Content to perish where gulf-girt they stand They hug their barren rock with dreary cheer— Confess to no confinement—vow they hear No wanderer's wail—no plaintive breeze's sigh, No moanings of the melancholy main: Life after death—that any Spirit can Exist apart from Matter—God or Man— To them a dream, how visionary—vain! What their minute sensorium may contain, What they could touch, taste, smell or hear or see, Is all that in the Universe can be! Well! it will have its day—that simple notion! But might they not as well—these pleasant men Strive to compress the blue tremendous Ocean In all its dim far-sparkling boundlessness Into yon yellow calabash! And when They failed—declare with confidence no less, With self-complacent doggedness insist, That all it would not hold did ne'er exist: That no reflections on its outer side, No dancing day-gleams from the waters wide, Are any signs that Seas or Oceans roll Beyond the circlet of that narrow bowl?” IV. “Well, that I cannot understand, you know; But tell me what you think yourself is true; That I am certain must be right—and so Will I believe, and only trust in you.” “In me, dear Child!—but that indeed Were trusting to a broken reed!” “That reed no whit the less shall be A staff of trust and truth for me!” “Well then, suppose your eyes you close, And on my shoulder rest your head, While lasts, my sweet! this noontide heat And that shrill music sunshine-bred; And try to sleep while I devise Some answer wondrous deep and wise To my fond querist, little dreaming What mysteries questions may comprise To her so plain and simple-seeming.” “There—then; I will be still as death—” And soon the soft-recurring breath Long-drawn, and breast that gently heaves, Tell how the life that gushed and glanced So brightly, lies in sleep entranced— Sleep, placid, light and infantine— Serene as those green-imaged leaves That up through crystal pointing shine. Canto the Fifth. A cheery Theorist. 1. Ranolf goes over old ground. 2. ‘Will’—First Cause—displays ‘Mental’ powers. 3. Man could invent Geometry: long after, knowledge of the Universe proved that ‘God geometrizes’ too. Resemblance so far between Finite and Infinite ‘Mind.’ 4. Perhaps a like resemblance in the ‘Moral’ Sphere. Science virtually admits the possibility. 5. Does existence of Evi lnegative it? Evil revolts our divinely-given Finite Moral Nature; may revolt the Infinite too; though permitted for a purpose. 6. Our Moral standard (Love, etc.) should be as true as that Mental one. 7. Is it? The Will Divine shown by a dominant Power. Such Power certainly the Good. So the Moral Universe tends to harmony with our Moral standard. 8. This, if not satisfied here, why not elsewhere? 9. And as the mental standard foretold stars to fill gaps it found in the Physical, may not our moral one foretell completion of defects in the Moral Universe? 10. Ranolf concludes optimistically. I. Pondering on Amo's questions, while the Maid So lightly slumbered, lulled in noontide rest So still, the golden spots that flecked its shade Moved only with her moving half-hid breast, Perplexed and doubtful Ranolf lay. “What must I teach her? how impress This pliant Spirit's willingness? On this unlettered Soul so white What characters am I to write? What truths in sooth have I to tell To one whose native instincts might, For aught I know, teach me as well?— For I know nothing; could but play With some results our Sages say Are truths—and let them take their way. Where are we? let us run again O'er what of old seemed clear and plain. With nothing else have we to do But what we know or feel is true.”— His train of thought we cannot far pursue: How the old grounds for hopeful faith—some few And intellectual mainly, from the mass Too vast for swift reviewal, he ran through. All but some slight analogies we pass; Themselves but shadows in a darkling glass; Faint inklings of itself—imperfect hints On Finite Mind the Infinite imprints. II. “Cause—say a Power that causes—this Long since we saw must be and is. Dead Matter too we saw and see The cause of Force could never be. Saw while through Nature's circling zone None but results of Force are shown, One kind of source or cause of Force— One kind of Causal Power alone The Mind as thinkable could seize: The Will that in ourselves we own Sets Thought in motion when we please. So then we found it fair to hold This Will might some faint hint unfold Of what in its unboundedness Is different still beyond all guess— The Infinite Power—unknown—untold— That still unfolding—still o'erseeing— Still sets the glories we behold For ever whirling into Being! Sunclear we found it too—there shine Throughout the works that Cause Divine In its high Universe effects, Proofs of all powers (perhaps its least Although to infinite increased) Which by the human Mind displayed Infinitesimal in grade, This last in some slight way reflects. Nor feared nor fear we this maybe Anthropomorphic fallacy— Treading the path so often trod— In Man's own image making ‘God!’ III. “For say—for powers so proved—what name But ‘Mind’—could reason find or frame?— And does not one strange fact proclaim, Nay, prove this bounded Mind of Man In some accordance made, or grown, With that all-boundless Mind unknown That did the mighty Cosmos plan— Faint spark from its omnific Flame?— A thousand years that human Mind Its subtle sciences designed Of numbers—angles—ratios—lines— Complex ingenious symbol-signs— Pure brainwork as the wildest dream! Then, when the long research of Time, For Man's rapt gaze withdraws the veil That hides the Universe sublime, To his amazement, lo! the scheme Of the majestic fabric stands Before him, fitting to the Scale So long prepared by his own hands; In strictest keeping ranged and wrought With fine gradations, ratios, rules, Spun out of his unaided Thought So many an age before, and taught As abstract Science in his schools. 'Tis as if God himself blazed out A moment there! beyond all doubt Perceived—the still small voice profound Speaking for once with trumpet-sound! A glimpse of the All-Puïssant say A moment deigning to display Some kinship of its mind with ours— Its infinite with our finite powers! To prove how in our mind could lurk Some power to scale some little way Unconsciously the self-same heights Where soared its own imperial flights; Power to invent, construct, do work, Though far-off, faint, in thought alone, In strict accordance with its own! IV. “But the Infinite Echo the Finite could waken When the Intellect's rockier region it tried— Can it tempt from that Mystery tones unmistaken When it calls in the far-aloft forest-recesses Where the Heart and its finer-winged progeny hide?— Well—to speak not of ‘Duty’; all ‘Conscience’ impresses; All the hints and the hopes in the consciousness pleading For kinship more close with the Boundless and Blest; Even Science allows that the ‘Energy’ feeding The Universe-Life and Mankind's at its best, (Like the meaner blood-life though unconscious, unheeding, With the life of the Man co-existent, agreeing) But a lower subordinate function may prove Of some Life more sublime—a still loftier Being! But confess, there's no Life we can think of, above The highest this human can reach at its height, Save what may to Reason all-perfect unite— And to Will that could never be swerved from the Right, The ideal of boundless Benevolence—Love! Then, as we found betwixt the two— The Finite and the Infinite— In mental working—sound if slight Resemblance—kinship faint yet true; We might with less of self-conceit And with assurance more complete Expect (what seems ev'n requisite For Nature's harmony alone) In high emotions of the Heart, The human Being's nobler part, A like resemblance should be shown. V. “Ah, here we strike the stubborn rock!— One boundless Mind—First Cause of All— That mighty Fact not Physics, no, Nor metaphysics can o'erthrow! And ‘Infinite Will’—without a shock To Reason we may dimly deem The Force that works the Wondrous Scheme! Thus much will pass. But how to call That Cause all good—that Infinite Will Omnipotent? with Evil still So rampant? even the babe unborn By reckless Sires' diseases torn? The ‘God-made’ cat before your hearth Torturing the ‘God-made’ mouse for mirth? Well, these things outrage all our sense Of Justice—Love—Benevolence— All the instinctive moral powers That most exalt this soul of ours; These instincts now, howe'er they grew, From inner impulse—outer force, Or interaction of the two, Weaving in brain the fibres due, With all ‘like breeding like’ might do,— Yet surely sprang from that sole source— Were caused by Prescient Will divine— Made spring and grow so by design; These instincts so ‘God-made’ we say, Make what allowances you list For Evil's uses, ends, excuses— Are jarred, revolted every way That any Evil should exist! Then may we not deem that the Power whence came Those diviner emotions, whatever its name, Though we never may prove for what reason or aim It permits all the Evil, may yet in the vast Unknown of its Being—its schemes undisclosed, Be accordant so far with the highest we claim, As to will that this Evil be hated—opposed— By the Good it is used for be one day outcast— In the end overcome—done away with at last? VI. “Why should indeed the Power that gave To man that mental standard, found As true, complete, as wish could crave To gauge the sensuous Universe As its majestic shows unfurled— Be deemed to mock, as stinted, bound By some defect, some flaw unsound, Man's dearer need with any worse A standard of his moral World? Our Love, distinctly his own dower As is that calculating power— As surely our one gauge, the best— His spiritual Creation's test; Why should it be less true, complete? Why should it only prove a cheat? VII. “Or does that ‘Will Divine’ in fact As in this world we see it act— Permitting Evil—prove thereby Our standard false, that ‘Love’ a lie?— Long since we learnt one true reply. For own—the Will Divine must be Denoted by some power at least Of overmastering energy, Throughout the Universe we see Or that we see not; one whose sway Is active—in the ascendant—free— Ever increasing and increased; Not one that flourish how it may— Is worsted—weaker—giving way. In the material World, we know, Though Action and Re-action show Equal and needed both; although Both motion and inertness seem Balanced—essential to the scheme; Yet so-called Matter, in the last Result of that harmonious strife, Is whirled into victorious life; Resistance in the glorious sum Of things, is overborne, surpassed— If still renewed, is still o'ercome. Well, what results is what is willed— The intended—that which is fulfilled. So in the moral World—the Good Is counteracted and withstood By Evil; yet this last, 'tis clear (The matter of the moral sphere) Is found, as the long centuries roll, Still more and more subdued—outdone; Of those two forces, on the whole The losing and the lessening one. Although the contest ceases never, Though nothing may the two dissever, Though Evil may the stuff supply Good works on—here has being by; Yet, as Time flies, who can deny, For guerdon of the World's endeavour, Good triumphs—there is Progress ever!— No doubt, the single Will Divine Decrees and works both powers; as, when A rower directs a pair of sculls, With one hand backs, the other pulls— Both acts are caused by one design. So Evil seconds Good; but then The most triumphant element, The victor principle, must best That Universal Will suggest, Best argue the Supreme Intent. So even in the World we see, Good grows—and grows unceasingly: This Will must therefore be confessed— As far as our Experience shows, Or finite faculties disclose Its working—on the whole to tend Triumphantly to some great end In harmony with that high test Itself first planted in Man's breast, With this intent among the rest. VIII. “But why, because that mighty Will Cannot be said, within the bound Of our perceptions to fulfil All that the test, so true and sound, Demands—insists on; why declare Its wondrous working ceases where Our poor perceptions do?—why fear To say that what it breaks off here It perfects in some other sphere? Why carry through all Time and Space The flaw we only know has place Within the narrow field we trace? Why this avowed, yet finite Wrong, Into the Infinite prolong?— More true to Reason 'tis, to trust That standard of the Good and Just And Loving—trust its dictates too. If this world wrongs that standard true, It wrongs God's Love, God's Right no less; That wrong His justice must redress: And how? but by some other state Where compensation must await All wrongs endured by small or great; All Love's requirements be supplied— The God-given standard justified? IX. “Aye truly! and as when by mere appliance Of that brain-fashioned scale of Abstract Science To the Star-worlds on high, diviners bold Have sometimes found a gap—declared a flaw In our serenest dance of sister spheres; And with a god-like confidence foretold The missing Planet needed by their law: And when the optic tube, redoubling sight, Comes in the course of long-revolving years To test the startling prophecy aright— Lo! there the cinders of the crumbled World, Of proper weight, in fitting orbit hurled! Or down in some obscure recess of Space, Lo! there the lurking lost one they will trace, And in some shining crowd you least suspect, The furtive golden fugitive detect!— Even so—when Love, that test diviner far, Finds mightier flaws the moral fabric mar, With full assurance may he not foretell Some compensating cure must somewhere dwell— Some good that shall the sense of wrong dispel? And if immortal Life and nothing less Be needed that deficience to redress, Is it a splendour of too vast an orb, Too bright for those whose gloom it should absorb— Too grand a boon by Man to be enjoyed, With his material kinship to the clod?— Nay—'tis a speck to Him who left the void; A World to us—a tiny Asteroid To the infinite Munificence of God! Well then—through all that glittering mystery Man sees that each demand brings its supply; Responsive forces each stray force correct, All waste restored, all aberrations checked; Till perfect in all parts before him stands The mighty structure from the Master's hands. With no harsh note—no inharmonious noise, Vast Worlds in myriads wing their flight sublime; Their balanced whirl no chance, no change destroys; But every pebble finds its counterpoise, And every Star comes rounding up to time!— So were the Spirit-World found perfect too Could we its whole completed cycle view; No wrong its neutralizing right would miss; No sorrow some equivalent of bliss; And every Soul whate'er its make or mood, Though long or short the circuit it pursued, Come brightening back at last to happiness and good!” X. But why prolong the sanguine strain? When even to Ranolf's self 'twas plain, The coolest, soberest argument, With or without his own intent (Nor made thereby, perhaps, less true) Although no kindling orb firenew Whirled freshly off some teeming train Of heated vapours of the brain; Say but a cinder of dead thought From smashed-up creed or theory brought; Soon by the heart's attraction caught, By feeling's friction set aflame, Straightway a shooting-star became— A mildly-flashing Meteorite That haply shed a shadowy light O'er nooks which Doubt had steeped in night! His glad conclusions this, we said, From Truth not more aberrant made. For will not, in all likelihood, The Future's final faith (or growth In faith—if faith be understood A thing of no finality) Some joint result and compound both Of Intellect and Feeling be— Outcome of Heart as well as Mind Of universal Humankind?— But these will never loose their hold Or lessen their august demands On Hope! or from her Angel hands Take brass for all her promised gold! Small wonder then, and less reproach To Ranolf, if the soothing hour— That silvery-crimson crystal bower Of bliss—and all the bloom and pride Of Love and beauty by his side— Lapping his soul in such excess And luxury of loveliness— On Reason's sphere might so encroach With subtler, more persuasive power And rosy light their radiance lent,— Soon to a close his musings drew In hardihood of rich content That half to careless rapture grew! “Enough—enough! I know—I knew To sense and reason's widest view, The cheerful still must be the true! Look up, my love! nor longer keep That sweet pretence of trustful sleep; I know beneath each full-orbed lid The coiled-up living lustre hid Lurks ready for an innocent dart— Not aimed at—sure to hit—the heart; And round the placid lips the while Dawns the faint twilight of a smile! Then listen, sweet! and let me try To queries wide what seems to me In this our great obscurity A true—albeit a trite reply?” Canto the Sixth. Love beats Logic. 1. Ranolf's theism and belief as to Future Life. 2. Hardly satisfying to Amo. Both too content with the present to be troubled much about the Future. 3. Old truth—conviction of immortality got by moral experience, (4) and mysterious ‘soul-motions’ such as the ‘Aprile’ of Browning alludes to. 5. Too much care for the future ungrateful perhaps? 6. Amo learns to write. 7. The Lovers make and feel the beauty of the scene. I. Like him who glancing at the sun's full splendour Is by that lightning-ringed blue disc half-blinded, Then Ranolf, by the greatness of his theme So dazzled, told the Maiden simple-minded Whose thirsting eyes, with looks how rapt and tender Drank fawn-like at his voice's cheery stream, Of one Great Spirit ubiquitous;—for ever Unknown;—invisible—intangible— Inaudible; whose nature none can tell; Subtler than Thought in essence; and yet never To be disproved—discarded—disavowed; Educing Good with infinite endeavour From Evil for some mystic end allowed; Whose work, Mankind, would be a cheat detected, A palpable abortion and confusion (Truly an inconceivable conclusion!) If not in some serener Sphere perfected: For He was good—all Life and time proclaimed it, Where Good was ever in the slow ascendant; And that blind bias (Conscience as we named it)— Towards what seems good and better—though dependent On other powers, for knowledge, be it granted, Of what is good and better,—was implanted Within our brain at first, and could not be Belied or outraged by Himself who framed it; So must the Evil and the wrong be righted In some great World of bliss we could not see, Where suffering innocence would be requited, And ties of rent affections reunited. And this, which Reason pleaded for,—the best And brightest of that Spirit's emanations— Souls in their very structure revelations Of his high nature on their own impressed, Had felt and died for; on the facts insisting Their souls were forced and fashioned to attest— The certain Life immortal, to remove And remedy all mortal woes existing; And that supreme predominance of Love! And therefore they who most their Souls may nourish On Love, and hearken to his high decreeing, Doing all right and every wrong repressing, With pure self-sacrifice for others' blessing— Must be the least unlike that Power supernal— Most with that Will in their poor way agreeing; Must be the fittest to survive and flourish In that transcendant Sphere of Life eternal— Of ever blest and beatific Being. II. Poor, vague, and disappointing merely These reasonings to the listening Maid appeared; Scarce lighting up that shadowy Life more clearly Than the rude faith wherein she had been reared. Some simple tale of pathos and pure wonder, The founts divine of pity and awe unsealing, With death's great mystery mystically dealing, Her mental clouds had sooner rent asunder— More strongly stirred her fancy and her feeling. But all was Gospel from his lips that fell; His tongue more gifted than with Prophet's spell. And what he felt might well for her suffice, Who, free from anxious fear too curious, nice, Held this no theme to handle too austerely, Wholly absorb, or trouble her too nearly! Her lovelit bosom knew no listless pining For future worlds or lives beyond divining, With so much glory in the Present shining. And Ranolf had no taste for doubts intrusive, Nor chafed too much at reasons inconclusive. The mystery of the mighty Universe He loved to play with as a subtle jest, As children with conundrums; none the worse Because the answer could not soon be guessed. While its reality was a pure joy That well might heart and life and love employ— A bliss no doubt, no mystery could destroy! III. And though he showed himself content no more Even now than in old student-days of yore To practise and abide by what he saw Even then might be for Man a settled Law; He could not, while he reasoned, quite forget The possible truth so long before descried, Which of itself had made him feel as yet How slight his power to be that Maiden's guide; That time-developed secret of the soul, How the conviction of its glorious goal And ultimate high destiny divine, Is haply not designed to be the dower Of any play of intellectual power— No cold deduction Logic's subtlest line Could dimly draw from shadowy postulate, Mental or moral axiom overfine, Admitted or disputed, as innate Or for purblind Experience to acquire; No theme to wrangle on with wordy strife: But down—far down—in gulfs of Spirit profound, Which action and keen passion only sound— Lies, a pure gem for purified desire; But rather, perfect gold by patience won, Must by severer Alchemy be run Out of each Soul plunged in the actual fire, And smelted in the crucible of Life. IV. No! he could not forget that Truths like these May lurk secreted for the Soul to seize Out of the chaos of her own emotions; Heights of celestial rapture—depths like Ocean's Of sacred sorrow; mystic yearnings speech Is speechless for no intellect can reach; Divinely-darkling inmost sympathies, Dimly discerned—awakened—half-exprest Haply by the blind might of Music best Echoing Infinitude; ‘strange melodies’ That lustrous Song-Child languished to impart, Breathing his boundless Love through boundless Art— Impassioned Seraph from his mint of gold By our full-handed Master-Maker flung; By him whose lays, like eagles, still upwheeling To that shy Empyrean of high feeling, Float steadiest in the luminous fold on fold Of wonder-cloud around its sun-depths rolled. Whether he paint, all patience and pure snow, Pompilia's fluttering innocence unsoiled;— In verse, though fresh as dew, one lava-flow In fervour—with rich Titian-dyes aglow— Paint Paracelsus to grand frenzy stung, Quixotic dreams and fiery quackeries foiled; Whose rocket-rush of Power, at death's far height Melts in a silvery rain of loving Light;— Or—of Sordello's delicate Spirit unstrung For action, in its vast Ideal's glare Blasting the Real to its own dumb despair,— On that Venetian water-lapped stair-flight, In words condensed to diamond, indite A lay too like the Sun—dark with excessive bright:— Still,—though the pulses of the world-wide throng He wields, with racy life-blood beat so strong,— Subtlest Dissector of the Soul in song!— —No! with that possible Soul-truth full in sight, 'Twas little disappointment, less surprise, To Ranolf that he read in Amo's eyes Not all the satisfaction and delight She looked for when the queries first she pressed Which he with more delight and greater zest Would doubtless, if he could, have set at rest. V. But all these things apart—to them the Real The Present seemed so rapturous an Ideal, It seemed almost a sin to speculate Or spend a thought upon another state; Seemed flat ingratitude to Him who spread A banquet so superb his guests before, To ask, when on its dainties they had fed, What His great bounty had provided more? While sitting at His luxury-laden board, To guess what fair festivities the Lord Of the redundant feast had yet in store, Music or dance to follow when 'twas o'er! VI. And so to lighter themes they gaily turn; And “Rano! when shall I begin to learn”— Said then the lively girl, “the white man's art Of seeing talk—and sending, word for word, To distant eyes unspoken speech unheard?”— And Ranolf straightway hastened to impart A first fond lesson in the mystery deep Of letters—guiding that confiding hand To trace huge characters on marbled sand, Or clean smooth claystone of some yellow steep; With many a toying frolicsome reproof, And merry chiding, when the stalk of fern And taper fingers seemed resolved to turn Some curve from what was aimed at far aloof; And both would join in joyous outcry wild At each great blunder of the Woman-Child; With childlike guerdon of a kiss no less Rewarded at each wonderful success. But such a keen and kindling sympathy Between their hearts and minds electric played, Both Taught and Teacher could delighted see How swiftly and how sweetly, so conveyed, The pupil would imbibe that mystery; How soon that lovely Learner would o'ercome The task of noting down in symbols dumb The speech the learner with her loving smile Was teaching to the Teacher all the while. VII. And now, upon a knoll beside the Lake, Embowered with trees their resting-place they make. The savoury light repast was over, won By Manu's indefatigable gun, Whose echo through the day they oft had caught Faint from the glens or o'er the waters brought. Their young elastic spirits they resigned To the soft hour's delicious influence, And the full consciousness of all the bliss Of love like theirs in such a life as this; As sweet and free to their enamoured sense As the pure air without a sound or sigh They breathed in its sunlit serenity. The solitude—the stillness so intense— The blue ethereal lake—the liquid sky— The silent banks and bluffs that watched around;— The silent beams that broadly visible streamed Through limpid veils of atmosphere, and gleamed Along the silent hills that looked, spell-bound, As if they felt the shadows o'er them grow, From every fold and crevice creeping slow And linking to exclude each slanting ray That slumberous on their burnished shoulders lay:— Or where those faint cliffs seemed in fading day Refining to a vision far away; Soft tints aërial—tender streaks of shade, Or mottling stains their painted verdure made.— All was so rapt and mute and motionless— The pictured dream of lonely loveliness Diffused o'er hearts that needed no such balm The soft contagion of its soothing calm! Twin hearts—mere atoms in the wide expanse— They seemed absorbed in its voluptuous trance; Yet 'twas the rapturous love that through them thrilled That rather into Nature's frame instilled Their own impassioned warmth, until it glowed As fit for spirits in bliss some high divine abode! Canto the Seventh. An airy Nest. 1. Sunset on the Lake. 2. Evening—and Love—divine. 3. The ‘Downy Ironheart-tree’—whence its propensity to fit itself for survival? 5. Stars; Orion upside down. 6. Plans for the morrow. 7. The airy nest. 8. Return home. I. Now Sunset's hushed and awful Splendour fills The solemn scene;—transfigures heaven and earth With luminous glory as in strange new-birth; Clothes with vermilion woods the Eastern hills; And where the Lake should spread its glassy length Leaves a great hollow of one hue—blood-red As the mysterious garments round Him rolled Who travelling in the greatness of his strength, In glory of apparel unalloyed, Though stained like one who doth the winepress tread, From Edom and from Bozrah came of old. A single bar of light, a silver thread— Stretched o'er the incarnadined and hollow void— Betrays the viewless surface. On each hand See how the headlands glow in solid gold! See in the midst that mighty Mountain stand One ruby!—deepening off through bluer shade And bluer, towards the North the hills and sky Lose more and more of that ensanguined dye— Through all the purples of the pansy fade; And in their darkest, most impressive gloom, Rival the richest violet's loveliest bloom. II. And Amo felt the evening;—felt The solemn tenderness that dwelt In all that gorgeous flood of pride And splendour, spreading far and wide Into her kindred spirit melt: And nestling close to Ranolf's side As half in sport and half in fear— “Hush!”—whispered she, quite serious-eyed— “Some awful Spirit must be near!— What is it else that from the deep Abyss o'erhead, seems so to creep And creep—and ever nearer steal, As though the heavens above us bending, Were closing round us—slow descending!— Not evil though, that Spirit, I feel! But like some gentle boundless arm Encircling us—in shelter warm Infolding us from hurt or harm; Close to us, yet unheard, unseen: Just as I felt you bending down One morn above our couch of fern, Which you had left so soon, to learn What bird it was whose strange new cry ('Twas that blue crane with bristly crown— You recollect?) we heard so nigh; And I, unknowing your return Lay half-awake nor wooing sleep; With eyes just lightly shut to keep Your image there with clearer glow, And play with it in fancy so; In dreamy bliss—such full content— Somehow as calm and innocent, It seemed, as when in infant days Upon a mother's breast I leant; So loath was I my lids to raise; Or my fantastic joy resign Till I should be no more alone!— But you had stol'n towards me unknown; And though I neither saw nor heard, I felt your face approach my own: Your lips were almost touching mine, But did not—and no limb you stirred; I neither heard nor felt your breath, For you were silent—still as death; And yet I knew your presence dear, I knew that it was you so near, Pausing before you would impress To wake me quite, some light caress Of fond and playful tenderness. But that was Love—made me so wise, To see without the use of eyes; And know who 'twas did by me stand, Without the aid of ear or hand: No tongue to speak—no limb to move, Was needed for my heart to prove That near approach of Love to Love!”— “Yes—that was Love! and this, as well, This solemn, sweet, absorbing spell, This charm diffused o'er heaven and earth, In Love may have its hidden birth! For all that Reason—Science—guess, It stands a mystery, none the less;— A symbol, why not so designed To do just what we find it do? Impress upon the human Mind A soothing sense of Love as true, As warm and true as mine and thine, But infinite—and all divine!— III. “But see! how through the floating, thin, And tender purple gloom, one star Is wildly throbbing—faint and far! And lost in liquid twilight, look, Where others lurk its depths within!— Come, dearest, then! in yonder nook See how, from its sun-smitten slopes The snowy-crimson trees outthrow Their sturdy stems that downward grow, All firmly laced, securely braced And cabled to the rocks with ropes Of their own branches, backward bent Along each coalescing trunk, Half in its rugged column sunk As up to roots again they run, Stem, branch, and root, distinct yet one! As if they saw and would prevent, With conscious aim intelligent, The great tree's risk so imminent Of slipping down the steep descent. IV. “But does the risk produce the aim?— On level ground no cables sprout:” (Thinking aloud, all this, no doubt) “Or if in some rare case thrown out— Perchance where casual winds create A partial risk, but not the same— The cable hangs its listless weight Unreaching earth; its would-be roots, A tuft of red abortive shoots. Adaptive Nature's powers are great; And her organic products mate And match each shifting change and chance Of inorganic Circumstance; Set each to each in ordered dance, With a discriminating might Of blindness keener than all sight; And kindling here, and quenching there At random—but with luck so rare And mutual, ever full and fair The cycle of Existence leave. The trees that could their cable weave Might stand—and those that could not—fall; I wonder what the cause they call, Gave this though not another tree That cunning first propensity For veering cables out at all! Was it itself, itself to save Such self-preserving prescience gave?— This ‘struggle for existence,’ saith Your Science, everywhere we view; Yes! and 'tis Life's untiring true Protest against and hate of Death! V. “But come, my sweet, since there at last, The pendent trees are anchored fast; Suppose a fern-filled mat we sling To one, up high, of those that fling Their branches out most straight and stout! So fine the night we need devise No roof against those loving skies. How pleasant there to lie awake And try if any glimmering sheen Or shimmer of the sleeping Lake So far beneath—through all the green— The latticed screen of boughs between, A leafy labyrinth—could be seen! How sweet to lie up there so high, And half asleep, so drowsily, To all the faint night-noises hark That make the hush more deep; and mark, Watching the dim o'erbrooding sky, How one by one and two by two The moving stars come blinking through The unmoving leaves—chink after chink— Slow-pacing!—or if you should sleep I might alone a vigil keep Sometimes for mere delight; and think What mighty Suns we use to link Our tiny memories with; and how Keen Sirius and red-flashing fierce Aldebaran that deep Space may pierce, And have no other end just now For me, but with familiar rays To call back far-off scenes and days! How the faint Pleiads are less clear Than fond regards they bring—so dear! And old Orion upside down, Mythic Bœotian huntsman brown— Though here such different names he own, Shines grand as his antique renown; And flings abroad his giant limbs In daring splendour nothing dims! Although head foremost towards the sea In all his glittering panoply He plunges, eager to return To those dear glorious lands below, Far down below, where long ago I first beheld his ardours burn!— VI. “And we will settle, nestling there Which way to-morrow we shall fare; If back to strange Orákei's stream Whose dark-green banks are chequered bright With many a gaudy scar and seam Sulphureous yellow—red and white, Where over crusted strata grey A hundred hot-springs steam and play: Or shall we to the Lake hard by Of woody Oka-réka hie, That mocks you with deceitful mien, By loving cliffs encompassed round— Fair captive, so resigned, serene, Lulled in a seeming sleep profound; Yet all the while slips off unseen In secret diving underground; And bursts out into open day A beautiful Cascade, they say, All flash and foam, a mile away! A sudden startling change complete From mimic death to leaping life, As yours, my wily winsome cheat, This morn when starting to your feet At touch of that rude ready knife!” VII. What answer? but a laugh of fond assent From her whose head upon his shoulder leant; As, gaily springing up, the Maid addrest Herself to that delightful task—to aid In building birdlike such a pendulous nest 'Mid twisted stems over the waters thrown, As charmed with thoughts of airy rest Lightly leaf-canopied and star-inrayed; Toyed with by tender touches of the Moon; Bare to each influence of the fine-flecked skies; And yet secure as ever flung the boon Of sweet unconsciousness o'er lovers' eyes— Yet in secluded luxury uplaid As ever rest enjoyed by lovers lone In any green serenity of shade. VIII. So through the fervid Autumn's lingering glow But Life and Love's young Spring-time; revelling so In Eden-scenes as lovely-strange As to the lover's power to change All scenes to Edens, ever yet displayed An Eden ready-made: So, custom-licensed to be blest and bless In luxury of lawful lawlessness, Did our unbridled bridal pair Pass their wild-honeymoon no moon Restricted—and, arriving all too soon, Homeward to Rotorua slowly strayed. BOOK THE SIXTH WAR. Canto the First. The Beleaguered Fortress. 1. War song of Tribes attacking Tangi's fortress—Mokoia. 2. Who they were, and why there. 3. The Magician's motives: and proceedings of assailants and defendants. 4. Two assaults failing, a third prepared. I. 1 The clashing of Tempests! The tumult of Tempests! To the West and the North On their terrible path They are rioting forth; And they crash altogether in a whirlwind of wrath Against the high fortress that bristles and towers In the midst of the torn Rotorua. How cowers The scared Lake!—how it shrieks—do you hear it? As the lightnings spear it, And savagely chase In the race Of affright The mad-fleeing flakes of the wind-levelled spray; Or shrivel, in flame-sheets how blindingly bright, Black tangible night To blue hideous day!— O the clashing, the flashing, the tumult, the jar, Of the gathered confederate tempests of War Over Mókoi-ahía! 2 See, see you the glare, O Riri, the glare?— How the flames leap in air, Bloodstaining the leaden-hued murkiness scowling O'er the high Western hills where the tempests are howling, Paparáta, Wainúku, with thunderclouds growling?— —No fire, no flashes, Erelong shall be there, No life-spark or love-light on mountain—in vale; Not a sound of despair, Sorrow-breath, Sob of wail— But the blackness of ashes, The silence of Death, Over Mókoi-ahía. 3 Come forth, my Canoe, My glorious Canoe! Right over the war-boats of Tangi, Right over their gunwales though fiercely they strive, Thou shalt drive, thou shalt drive, While the paddle-beat foam-waves enwreathe us, ha! ha!— Resistless—remorseless—right onward—no check— Thou shalt tread down and trample each plunging wreck! Thou shalt ride In thy pride O'er its hollow inside, While the hissing wave fills it beneath us, ha! ha!— O my tearing, all-daring, unsparing Canoe— O the might, The delight Of your conquering crew!— What a tustle shall wait them, A triumph elate them, A blood-revel sate them, At Mókoi-ahía! 4 Weave the great Chain— The great living Chain!— Over hill, over plain, Round and round, high and low, It shall go, it shall go, The beleaguering Chain round the Fort of the foe!— I-ará! I-ará!— Firm shoulder to shoulder, every inch of the ground— Strongly woven—well-knit—all the links true and sound— Around and around shall the great Chain be wound! High and low It shall go Round the fear-smitten foe!— Soft-stealing—close-hemming—all-stemming—death-dealing— O the leaguer of heroes At Mókoi-ahía! 5 How fretful the cries, The plaintive wild cries Of crimson-billed terns when in bright azure weather They flock wheeling in from all parts of the skies, Confusedly fluttering and huddling together To dabble and scramble for food in the water!— Rotorua's proud islet shall see such a muster; From the regions all round so our victims shall cluster! So shall they On that day Crowd in helpless array, So be gathered at once all together for slaughter! Wild-crying—no flying—all dying—no trace Of their race Shall be left on earth's face!— Thus our foes shall be crushed And the battle-roar hushed Over Mókoi-ahía!— Such was the purport of the measured roar, A warrior-crowd by Rotorua's shore From time to time across its waters flung, Their wild excitement growing as they sung. The song foreshadowed vengeance long-desired; Visions of victory hate and hope inspired— But vengeance doubtful—victory yet to win. One singer fierce in savage solo first, Within the space the circling throng left clear, Darting about with madly brandished spear, The ranting wild war-ditty would begin; Then as they all struck in, the chorus strong, Now full and furious, with a sea-like burst Of guttural thunder grandly rolled along; Now at the war-chaunt's pauses, interspersed Its short harsh sighs of deep-lunged expiration, Such as a pavier in a London street Gives when his ponderous hammer strikes the stones;— All panting forth in unison complete Hoarse harmony of heartfelt execration! Crash after crash of deep earthshaking groans, Whose echoes through the folded mountains tore— Escaping monsters, plunging on to hide In their recesses; nor even then forbore But far and farther off faint bellowings plied. II. This storm of war by Kangapo was brewed: 'Twas he had roused this raging multitude Of Uri-wéra, Nati-pórou—all The restless spirits turbulent and rude Amid the neighbouring tribes, South, East or West He found, or made, obedient to his call: For stung by Tangi's cool disdain—his breast Black with foul bile that Amo could arrest His schemes by flight; and worst, that such a prize Should by this chance-sent Stranger be possessed— One whom he would so heartily despise, But that he hated him so much, and feared,— Aye, feared!—he could no more endure those eyes That met his own so calmly and appeared To look right through his soul and life of lies, So high and safe above his sorceries— More than the hound the Moon's unmoving gaze Fixed on him mutely till he howls—and feels, How through his canine consciousness it steals— The fascination of those searching rays, That read his inmost thoughts, know all his ways, And fix him all the more, the more he bays:— Stung with such rabid jealousy and pain, Less for his own loss than the other's gain:— For he was of a nature Hate could move More deeply even than successful love; And even his Love burnt livid, like the flames Of liquids lit for joy in Christmas games, With bitter selfishness 'twas so imbued; While Hate that could through Love's triumphant mood Survive, on baffled Love would surely prey And batten into boundless life and play:— With all these feelings fuming thus, the Priest Had sought out Tangi's many secret foes And hollow friends; these—most in peace retained By dread of Tangi, and as great at least Of powers himself from his dark Atuas gained— Were prompt to seize whatever chance arose, That seemed to promise surety of success Against a Chief, whose frank blunt haughtiness Left many a rankling grudge, in hearts that owned His chieftainship while backed by strength; and more In neighbours not dependent; most of whom Could always point, besides, to some heirloom Of injury—ancient grievance safe in store Kept to produce, parade as unatoned, Harangue on and grow wild about, whene'er Interest might prove a breach was worth their care. And now that Priest's defection—proffered aid To Tangi's foes, such tempting juncture made! That sorcerer's help, to warn, foresee, foretell, And ever keep at hand, whate'er befel, The fresh reserve of some religious spell The fiercest Atua's favour to compel— With such ally what could against them be The force or fortune of the ‘Sounding Sea’?— And readier even than these for reckless raid Was many a youth with jealous fury fired, Who, when that liquid landslip set her free From bonds the “tapu” had around her knit, To Amo's hand had fruitlessly aspired. So, mustering quick in arms—sharp lances fit For thrust or whirl; flat spears with cleaving blade Of iron-hard wood; smooth clublets of green jade Whale's bone or black obsidian: and, though few, The white man's lightning weapons dearly prized For such death-dealing powers, swift, safe, and true As made all slaughter's ruder tools despised:— —Bearing of berries dried sufficient store, Hínau—karaka; sun-cured fish and maize; Their siege-provisions for not many days, As trusting to catch Tangi unprepared And take his fortress by surprise before His distant friends could to the rescue pour:— —Dragging—(by dint of desperate labour, shared Among thick-crowding, oft-renewed relays— A hundred straining limbs and voices timed As one, by that wild chaunt in chorus chimed)— Or carrying bodily—their big canoes, O'er hill and dale, with fierce incessant toil, And frantic ardour nothing could infuse But rampant greed secure of blood and spoil:— —Leaving the friends of Tangi as they passed— Too weak alone, each hamlet, to withstand The headlong progress of so large a band,— Within their palisadoes shut up fast:— Thus had the host with hopes of victory flushed, Through Tangi's country unimpeded rushed; And now were camped by Rotorua's Lake In swarms resolved his island-fort to take, Under the leadership of one, by far The boldest, vainest that had joined the war— And ‘Whetu-riri’ named—‘The Angry Star.’ III. Nor deem that Priest had wholly laid aside The object of his passion and his pride So long—his native tribe's success and power. Incensed to be so baffled and defied, His aim in giving Tangi's foes their hour Of partial triumph, was but to reduce The Chieftain's haughtiness till he should be More pliant to his own ascendancy. These crowds were tools and creatures for his use; For well he knew whenever he might please, He could the tumult he had raised appease; Upon their superstitious fears could play, And fright his new adherents from the fray With well-invented omens of dismay. This crooked course to so concealed an end, Did to his mind his project recommend; 'Twas doubly dear to him to win his will By secret exercise of sinuous skill; The consciousness of cunning mastery made A guerdon of success almost as dear As aught for which his cunning schemes were laid. Yet would he not even then, with insight clear, Deliberate purpose to himself confess, With cool deceptive art to forge or feign Omens and signs sinistrous, to restrain The assailants at the height of their success; But he had taught himself to think and feel The Atuas ever favoured his appeal— Could with a little management be brought To give him mystic aid whenever sought. And at the outset, glad was he to find, Tangi's own acts to aid his plans inclined; For the old Chief was so devoid of fear, When rumours of invasion reached his ear By foemen such as these, the thought he spurned, A notion too absurd to entertain; And still refused, when surer news he learned, With obstinate and absolute disdain, To sanction against danger threatening thence, Any unwonted measures of defence. So when the storm broke o'er him, and he found The tide of War advancing all around, He gathered hastily a sturdy band Of staunch adherents readiest to his hand: And on that island hill-cone, girt and swathed In tiers, with terrace, ditch and smooth-scarped bank, Where'er its natural slope less steeply sank; Each terrace a successive fighting stage; Behind each fosse, a bristling palisade Of posts with carved and monstrous heads arrayed, Red-ochred, grim, and grinning scorn and rage;— There they ensconced themselves to wait unscathed Till succours should be hurried up by sure And faithful emissaries swift despatched; There, in their fortress, as they felt, secure— Withdrawing from each ditch its wooden bridge, Lifting each terrace-ladder o'er its ridge, Each gate closed fast,—there scornfully they watched, Behind the walls, each movement of the foe;— Or frantically darting in and out The palisades, kept rushing to and fro With wild-tossed limbs and yell and taunting shout; Or wasting at long range a charge or two Of precious ammunition, if it chanced, Prowling about, a prying war-canoe Close to the isle too temptingly advanced; Or some marauding, reconnoitring band Upon the garden-level dared to land.— Thus, keeping ever at the boiling fret The fury that could find scant outlet yet, Thus did they shout, from morn to even-close, Or dance defiance of their swarming foes. IV. Twice had the foe made fierce attack; With slaughter twice been beaten back; For Tangi's staunch and stalwart band— The skill and valour far-renowned That marked the veteran's cool command— The lines that wound that hill around— And last, not least, unknown before, The dreaded weapon Ranolf bore That through the press could swiftly hurl A shower of deaths at every whirl,— All these together made a sum Of tough impediments no rush Of Uri-wéra's hosts could crush, Or arts, so far essayed, o'ercome. Yet for a fresh assault, one more Ere they should give the contest o'er, They roused, revived their flagging force And spirit dashed by ill-success; Revolving every rude resource Of savage war's ingeniousness: Each tried, untried experiment Old lore could teach, new craft invent; And plying all the wild man's ways Their forced factitious wrath to raise And blow their fury to a blaze. Canto the Second. War needs Idealizing. 1. War stripped of its splendour here. 2. It needs Genius to elevate it; such as Wellington's, Nelson's, Napier's; (3) Men fit for Empire— not to be won or kept by mere Utilitarianism; or the false Philanthrophy which would extinguish Patriotism and (4) ruin England. 5. A better fate for our worldwide Empire—of universal fellowship and mutual aid; no talk of ‘Self-help’ to colonies; obvious duty they recognize, as witness those killed in the war going on while this tale was being written. 6. Such deaths keep alive the spirit which will realize the Ideal of our British Empire—a crowned Federation centrally represented. 7. War a Worship. I. See now prepared for fresh assault And every wild resource of War, Both ‘Sounding Sea’ and ‘Angry Star’! —But let us call a moment's halt; For who can dwell with much delight On details bare of barbarous fight? War stripped of that superb disguise Of splendour which to youthful eyes Gives Terror more than Beauty's charms, And o'er Death's revel scatters rife Stern raptures of sublimest Life? The marshalled ranks—far-glittering lines; And square on square compact and dense— Each layer-like slab of life intense That firm as bristling rampart shines In such high-drilled magnificence! The single tramp and serried arms Of myriads moved like one together! The bayonet-blades—each row of steel Soft waving like a brilliant feather As in broad lines the regiments wheel— How in the sun they flash and quiver! The ponderous flying guns that cling And clutch at every vantage ground Like savage birds of heavy wing, And with volcano smoke and sound Exulting boom and blaze away; Or flit when they no more may stay, As vultures lagging leave their prey!— Then Music's thrilling witchery, From Matter's gross enthralment ever Potent the spirit to deliver, Fans all the Soul to fever-heat; The big drum's distant windy beat, Tumultuous-heaving stormy sea, Over whose plunging waves alway The fife's light notes dance up like spray! And trumpets soar and bugles call: Or loud in fits far rattling comes The glorious long-resounding shiver Of those impatient kettle-drums!— II. —But more than Music—more than all Imperial pomps and prides that shine To make Destruction's Art divine, Is that display, the grandest still To any human lot can fall, When Genius with consummate skill Wields the ennobling sword it draws Resistless in a righteous cause: Such as our wondrous Warrior drew, He, Duty's great Archangel—true The least or largest work to do That shrineless God could set him to! Whose Soul to that fast-zenithed Sun Glowed consecrate—its Magian fire, Kept burning ever, brighter, higher For storms of State—War's cloudracks dun— The wild vicissitude of things; A soul, a mien—erect—serene— 'Mid tumbling thrones and trembling kings!— —Or that high-passioned One—our loved Sea-King—whose frail war-shattered frame Seems, like the Sun's disc in its flame, Lost in his Spirit's blaze of Fame! That fiery soft great heart sublime, Who with his stately white-winged crowd Of lightning-bearing Sea-Swans, moved Majestical from clime to clime, And, wrapped in one sky-reaching shroud Of dense white level-jetted cloud, With grand sea-thunders swept away His country's foes where'er they rose;— Who, with such cool and crushing ease Like chessmen used to place and play His crowded floating fortresses;— Who like a rushing Comet, prest Across the World from East to West And back, in that gigantic race Of Warfleets o'er the Atlantic Main; When wondering Europe saw him chase Like doubling hares that scud in vain, The navies of proud France and Spain!— —Or He, whose dazzling deeds make pale (As well says one who paints the fray) Old marvellous times of casque and mail— Dense arrow-flights through thronging knights At Agincourt's and Cressy's fights; Whose might on great Meánee's day Wiped out again the Cábul stain, That red retreat—one slaughter! he Who that audacious victory With his heroic handful tore From twice as many thousand foes As he had hundreds; so, dispersed The hovering hundred thousand more Of ruffian-hordes with razor-swords Keen-panting on their prey to close; Flung to the winds the sway accurst, And rooted up no more to rise The regal stews and robber sties Of those Emeers whose quaking fears Erelong through Asia's wide heart ran; Till every turbaned Tyrant there And bloodstained bandit in his lair Shook at his very name—unscreened Though wastes and mountains intervened, Though round him raged a ruthless clan, Against this terrible true Man, This justice-wreaking holy fiend, This demon ‘brother of Shay-tan’ Fighting God's battles!— III. Aye, indeed! These men were the right genuine stuff To rule a World—a hero-breed— High minds, such as by instinct feed On mighty tasks,—Souls large enough For Empire!—Empire, never won As never kept, beneath the Sun, By slow hack-hearts that never knew A spur beyond material greed! The mere ‘utilitarian’ crew Whose huckstering God is only Gold; That ‘cheaply bought’ be ‘dearly sold,’ Their sordid creed and single heed; Whose grovelling zeal,—their Altar still The counter—and their Ark the till— At that base shrine would sacrifice Power, honour, Empire!—all the ties That keep us one; whatever wakes The patriot glow, the pride of race;— All that, with love of Order, makes A people of a populace, And any people great! whate'er Of quick and kindling sympathy With England's children everywhere— Our common claim to one great name, One heritage of storied Fame, It was our boast, our strength to share;— That conscious thrill of kindred blood Which false refinement feigns to raise, Evaporating all its good, Into a fine and feeble phase Of vague and vain Philanthropy; But kept alive,—yet none the less Alert to let no furtherance slip Of all-embracing comradeship And generous great wide-heartedness,— The more it can inspire, expand, So much more glorious, powerful, grand, Becomes each human brotherhood; And ever, just as each has grown To greatness or remained unknown, Did each this genial warmth possess Defective or in bright excess; The savage, for his tribe alone, The Roman for a World—his own! IV. But O thou Mother-Isle afar, Whose fame Thyself alone couldst mar! Should those mere sensuous saws indeed (If good and true to clothe and feed) Be idolized to supersede The holiest duties, highest aims Thy Rulers owe, thy welfare claims; And they and Thou, in pride secure, Be deaf to all the grand demands The glorious Gift of world-wide lands— Birthright of all thy swarming sons Won by the mighty deathless dead, Thy heroes' blood like water shed,— Thunders upon Thee; then be sure, England, my Country! nought avails Thy wealth, thy commerce; he who runs May read upon thy whited wall, The ‘Mene, Tekel’ of thy fall! Then hide thy head for shame—then say And sigh—thy soaring Sun has past Its zenith; own thyself at last— Weighed in the fitting trader-scales, Found wanting; then confess thy day Of greatness done—thy glory gone— Thy peddling kingdom passing fast away!— V. Ah no! such close shall ne'er await The dawning day when Thou shalt be To thy sublimest work awake! Full many a streak begins to break In purple promise of the fate We hope—foresee—foretell for thee! When such a sympathetic strain Of loyal fellowship shall reign Through all thy filial-federal train Of States by mutual interests bound— And Thy large heart, the long-renowned; Touch one—and one inspiring sound Of murmuring millions all alive To all that makes their union thrive, Shall thrill throughout the mighty hive! And prove, if Right before them shine, All lightning-like how prompt to strike, Not for a poor ‘Self-help’ alone, But Thou for theirs, and they for thine— All for each others' as their own! —‘Self-help’—but then the ungracious word In cold reproach shall ne'er be heard! If ever, as a shameless taunt 'Twas flung—ah, let the memory sink! Unworthy those in lofty place Who nobly rule a noble race, Not apt from such ‘self-help’ to shrink! Let that plain fact, no empty vaunt, Their deaths, those gallant ones! attest So oft struck down in wretched war By savage pride upon us prest:— Attest it his, among the rest— (Be thus much said for kinship's sake) Who sleeps the sleep no more to wake On earth, 'mid loveliest scenes afar Where Tonga-riro's snows disgorge Their flames by blue Te Aira's lake— Young, kindly, chivalrous St. George! Whose honour-fired aspiring brain Before that instant-blighting ball Flashed into darkness without pain, As in his wonted “dashing style” (His comrades said) his men he led Against the palisadoed wall Of that last prophet-cannibal Whose torturing tastes—impostures vile— Into worst horrors back again Of sickening savage life trepanned A brutal duped benighted band.— So swiftly his bold course was run, That daring Spirit's duties done, To whom the night and day were one, As through dense forest-glooms he crashed, Through flooded rivers dauntless dashed, Or galloped past thick fern, close by Where murderous scouts would lurking lie; To keep our friends in heart, disclose The machinations of our foes,— With cool clear-sighted fiery zeal Unceasing!—Ah, too soon the seal Was set upon that life unknown, That bud of promise nipt unblown! The making of a hero marred, If ever, then, when evil-starred That young career by death was barred! VI. But not in vain—not void of gain Devoted deaths so nobly dared! Deaths that keep living unimpaired The spirit to raise into the Real Our English Empire's grand Ideal! To build up, and from clime to clime Extend that civil fabric sound Of balanced social forces Time Has their securest safeguard found; Which, best for ordered Freedom still, Still leaves the changeful Public Will Unchangeably imperial-crowned! That Empire—for the wisely free A kindred haunt, a kindly home! No poison-spreading Upas-Tree; No Rata-Myrtle, pressing down The life it wrecks to raise its own; Nor e'er while sheltering like old Rome Perhaps half-stifling—realm or race In baneful shade—too strict embrace! Rather some bounteous-burgeoning Vine, Strong-stemmed—tough-jointed—rooted fast, About whose purple-clustered vast Luxuriance beauteous runners blow, And rich strange blossoms interlace; All round about each other curled To swathe and wreathe the rotund World With flowers of Freedom; petals fine Of peaceful Glory; fruits that shine 'Mid equal rights and laws and grow To mellowest richness in the glow Of Reverence for all duties clear, And all emotions—deep—divine! All for the common strength and good Enringed with many a tendril-twine Of mutual help and brotherhood: And woven from them all perchance— Of fittest growths and finest blent, From many a region far and near, Their central garland of supreme Impartial earnest governance! And for the sovran ornament Of that majestic anademe— Climax and star that world-cymar To crown—a world-wide cynosure— Some peerless Lily, say, or pure Camellia breathing the sweet power White goodness has to sway—allure!— —Nay, waive weak metaphors! What flower Were emblem worthy to recall The full deserts most favouring fate May on such culmination shower! —The life-long loyalty to all The limits of that high estate; All duties with a genial charm Of gentle dignity fulfilled— Grace by a Mind for ever warm With clear exalted aims instilled; The lofty courage, and no less True woman's lively tenderness And sympathy unerring, wide, For suffering hearts where'er descried— Right wisdom!—all the worth we see, And seeing, love, revere and bless— Victoria—Queen who dost possess All worth this Age's Best confess Best fits this Age's Queen—in Thee! VII. But this is from our theme remote, (A respite brief from ruder life!) Where present need was but to note How poor a thing is human strife Deprived of aids that seem designed To make even War a Worship! make Its mad turmoil the semblance take Of some ennobling rite where Mind Lords it o'er Matter—Soul o'er clay— With absolute predominance And solemn deep significance; Until the very Battlefield Becomes a Temple for display Of spirit-proving deeds death-sealed Of high Self-sacrifice—sublime Devotion; and the bloody sod Grows eloquent of something more Than Duty—something beyond Time— In recompense of Life and Soul Flung freely down, unstinted, whole, To magnify, uphold, restore The cause of Good—and therefore God! But War in this stark savage way Looked too much like mere lust to slay; Of its resplendent mask laid bare The face of naked Murder seemed to wear; Its hateful visage tempered by no glance Of lofty purpose or superb Romance. Canto the Third. The grand Assault. 1. War-speeches and War-dances. 2. The ‘Angry Star's’ host cross the Lake and challenge the Fort in chorus. 3. Tangi's contemptuous answer. 4. Attempt to fire the Fort. 5. The ‘Angry Star’ battering the palisade. 6. Tangi charging; heading a sally. 7. Ranolf (8) meets the ‘Angry Star.’ 9. A stratagem. I. Well—all the warrior-speeches had been made; Now, with a coarsely classic dignity Of grave debate and stern; and full parade Of flowing dog-furred mantle, and blunt spear With head tongue-shaped and feathery-ruffed, inlaid With glistening shelly eyelets pearly-clear; Now in rank virulence of savagery Complete—each naked speaker as he shrieked In hoarse harsh tones of mad complaint and rage, Impatient, like a wild-beast in its cage, To and fro fretting at a short quick run, With which each fragmentary fierce appeal, Each furious burst was ended and begun; And every time he turned his angry heel Slapping his tattoed thigh; until he reeked And foamed; and breathless, voiceless, faint, Was forced at last to yield the task, to paint And passionate his griefs, to younger tongues, Less wearied limbs and unexhausted lungs. And then they danced their last war-dance to gain The physical fever of the blood and brain That might their dashed and drooping spirit sustain, Nor let their flagging courage fail or flinch. Then formal frenzy in full play was seen; The dancers seemed a mob of maniacs, swayed By one insane volition, all obeyed, Their mad gesticulations to enact With frantic uniformity, exact As some innumerably-limbed machine, With rows of corresponding joints compact All one way working from a single winch: The leaping, dense, conglomerate mass of men Now all together off the ground—in air— Like some vast bird a moment's space—and then Down, with a single ponderous shock, again Down thundering on the groaning, trembling plain! And every gesture fury could devise And practice regulate, was rampant there; The loud slaps sounding on five hundred thighs; Five hundred hideous faces drawn aside, Distorted with one paroxysm wide; Five hundred tongues like one, protruding red, Thrust straining out to taunt, defy, deride; And the cold glitter of a thousand eyes Upturning white far back into the head; The heads from side to side with scorn all jerking And demon-spite, as if the wearers tried To jerk them off those frantic bodies working With such convulsive energy the while! —Thus—and with grinding gnashing teeth, and fierce Explosions deep in oft-narrated style, Those vollied pants of heartfelt execration; Or showers of shuddering hissing groans that pierce The air with harsh accordance, like the crash When regiments their returning ramrods dash Sharp down the barrel-grooves with quivering clang In myriad-ringing unison—they lash Their maddened Souls to madder desperation!— Thus all the day their fury hissed and rang; So groaned, leapt, foamed, grimaced they o'er and o'er; Till all were burning, ere the sun should soar, Against that stubborn Fort to fling themselves once more. II. Before the faint wide smile of dawn, so wan And grey, to steal up Night's sad face began, Crammed in canoes bold Whetu-riri's host With favouring breeze had to Mokoia crossed. With hearts high-beating to the strand they spring, Each band behind its Chief; without a check Hasten through grove and garden—many a bed That late in such luxuriant neatness spread, Of melons, maize and taro—now a wreck. The outer palisades the foremost reach; Take the positions prearranged for each; And close around the Fort, a swarming ring:— Then—as no challenge came—no warrior stirred, And not a sound about the Fort was heard; At once, like one—six hundred throats or more Sent thundering skyward such a sea-like roar As old Mokoia never heard before: “How long, how long Will your courage sleep? When will it wake from its slumber deep, When will your fury be fierce and strong?— O but the tide it murmurs low, Low and slow Beginning to creep; 'Twill be long 'Twill be long Ere it roar on the shore In the strength of its flow! Take with spirits heavy-laden, Take your leave of wife and maiden; Press, ha! press in last embraces To your own their weeping faces! Press them paling, Weeping, wailing— All your efforts unavailing! For see, for see, The brave and the strong At your gateways throng! See, see, how advancing in lines victorious All your efforts scouting, scorning, To the fort you lurk dismayed in, Brave and strong We tramp along! Ha! we come! exulting, glorious As those mountain-summits hoary! Proud as mountain-peaks arrayed in The magnificence of Morning We come for glory—glory—glory! We come! we come!—” Stern—silent—in determined mood Within those loop-holed walls of wood, Alert, be sure, old Tangi stood; He and his stalwart warriors true, Alert, well-armed and watchful too! Each short sharp-edged batoon of stone Grass-green, or white of polished bone,— That from the hand no foe might wring The weapon at close grips—was bound With thongs each sinewy wrist around; But loose the long-armed axe was left, Both hardwood blade and pointed heft— A dagger, or an axe to swing, Just as the warrior thrust or cleft. The precious muskets, rude and few, Their blunted flints well-chipped anew, All primed and cocked, were pointing through The palisades, behind whose breast Keen, eager, fierce, the clansmen pressed, Like wild-beasts waiting for a spring. But yet no tongue the stillness broke, No shout of wild defiance woke; For to that threatening, thundering strain, The sole reply the Chief would deign Was one brief proverb, as his hand Waved silence to his eager band: And that firm lip, comprest before, A haughty smile contemptuous wore; “Ay, come!” he growled—“come on to shell Cockles on Kátikáti's shore!” That long-disputed dangerous land, As every Maori knew so well, Fit for no tool but spear and brand; On whose contested sands and rocks, Who came got nothing but hard knocks; For, plucked from that long home of strife A limpet might have cost a life! Hence grown a gibe for all who set Their hearts on gain they ne'er would get. IV. But soon as Tangi's taunt was flung, And while the roar redoubled rung, The assailing ranks disparting wide,— There forward rushed—a gloomy wood It seemed, or some great tidal wave, In doubtful light the dawning gave! A hundred of the bravest brave Swept darkling up in order good; Each in his left hand holding high A bundle huge of brushwood dry And withered fern that hid him quite— Him and the fire-brand in his right. Against the fort their heaps they piled, And soon the flames were raging wild; For still the breeze that brought them o'er Blew freshly from the further shore. It lighted up, that sudden glare, The fort—the shore—the swarming, bold, Blue, ghastly faces writhing there With wrath and frenzy uncontrolled! The fern became a mass of fire, A brilliant yeast of surging gold; And whirling darkly from the pyre The smoke in russet volumes rolled With showers of sparks and frond and spray Red-hot, or floating filmy-grey. Old Tangi, Ranolf, and his train Of warriors strove, and strove in vain To heave the blazing heaps aside; No naked limbs or clothed could bide That heat—no lungs could long sustain The smoke that, blinding, stifling, dense, Drove ever thicker through the fence. So forced from that first outwork, they With teeth that gnashed in scornful rage, And shouts of fury burst away Leaping and clambering up to wage The fight upon a higher stage; Headlong as alligators bounce With water-snakes and bull-frogs harsh, Out of some rank rush-covered marsh, In river-depths to plunge and flounce— In Hayti or the Isle made glad With springs perennial crystal-fed— When some crab-hunting negro-lad Has fired their reedy crackling bed. V. Then wild with joy the ‘Angry Star,’ At this success—the first the war Vouchsafed his arms—let loose again His rampant pride, his boastful vein. By fear, by prudence undebarred, Up to the fence, black, tottering, charred— (His feet,—with green flax-sandals shod Prepared for this, the reeking sod And glowing embers safely trod) He bounded; took his dauntless stand With granite-headed axe in hand Beneath it, and began to rain A shower of blows with might and main, As each had been his last for life, On crumbling post and crashing stake, Broad entrance for his band to make. There,—bellowing loud his battle-song, His favourite song in such a strife, While all the less adventurous throng (Save six or eight who lent their aid) Until the breach might be essayed A more respectful distance kept,— Less man than frenzied fiend of hell He raved and roared and danced and leapt And right and left his weapon swept— A blow at every leap and yell Against that smoking citadel: “Hit out, hit out My battle-axe stout! Ha, ha! you should tell The sound of it well, How it played Long ago On your crashing stockade! Do you know, Do you know Who your foe may be? Prick your ears up and hark! Or come if you dare, I-ará! if you dare Come out and see! Whetu-riri!—'tis he, Whose eyeballs glare Red stars in the dark! 'Tis he! 'tis he!— Hit away—hit away, My battle-axe gay! Hit out—hit out, My warriors stout! The dastards rout And Victory shout— I-ará! I-ará!” VI. Now all upon that windward side The fallen fence left passage wide, And Whetu-riri's raging host The ditch and barrier swiftly crossed; While Tangi's men retreating, threw Themselves inside the rampart new; And as the palisades they passed Made every sliding panel fast, Till round the fort the assailant horde Upon the second platform poured. Then out—unable to restrain His pent-up wrath, his fierce disdain, Or patient wait his foes' attack; With all his bravest at his back,— Just as the glorious Sun again Slipped silvery from the mountains black With panting disc upfloating free— Out rushed at last the ‘Sounding Sea’ In wild ferocious majesty, His battle-cry resounding loud Above the tumult of the crowd! “Now, forward, now, my Sons with me— Now forward to the Land of Death!—” That shout o'er all the hubbub swelled Of casual shots and bulwarks felled And stakes that crashed and fiends that yelled, Distinct as—from the midnight's core Where leaps the blue sheet-lightning's blaze And hissing rains in torrents pour, The dread Caffrarian lion's roar That shakes the earth to which he lays His head and thunders—rises o'er And deeper-volumed rolls beneath The angry bellowings that disclose Where stamp, upstarting from repose Whole herds of snorting buffaloes! Where'er that Chieftain charged, dismayed His foes fell back like huddling sheep The wild-dog drives into a heap; Or brief the fight the brave essayed: So deadly swept as on he rushed His ponderous battle-axe's blade; Each chief who his encounter stayed Just met him, and with right arm crushed Disabled from the contest slunk; Or down at once scarce groaning sunk With cloven skull and quivering trunk. —The ‘Angry Star,’ for all his boast, Not yet the veteran's path had crossed, But, as it seemed, preferred to close With less renowned, less dangerous foes; Or had a craftier game to play More sure than such a doubtful fray. So still resistless through the fight Old Tangi raged; still rose on high O'er all the noise that battle-cry, “Now forward to the realms of Night!”— Yet still for numbers beaten back Fresh numbers pressed the fierce attack; The platform mounted—haply dared To charge the very gates across The bridges left upon the fosse By Tangi, for retreat prepared. But vain their toil—their fury vain; No hold, no entrance could they gain— Resisted all—repulsed or slain. VII. Meanwhile upon another side Young Ranolf with a trusty band Had sallied,—when his anxious bride Fair Amo,—who whate'er her fears Gave no weak way to sighs and tears But o'er her heart kept brave command, Had to her serious brow and breast Her hero—husband—lover prest; And prayed him, only for her sake Be careful, or her heart would break! But he, although his own beat fast With strange excitement at this new Experience, reassuring smiled On the devoted desert-child: And with that confidence, the glow Of burning blood, and nerves high-strung And braced by hardy life, bestow On those born brave, in health, and young,— Till death, disaster, they contemn As things not meant, not made for them! And hold their fortune, fate so high, All danger they may well defy,— He bade her, laughingly, rely Upon his luck, too good by far For him to fall in such a war! Then sallied with his friends where they As older warriors led the way. With no ferocious wish to slay, No savage thirst for blood, at first Our generous youngster only chose To use his deadlier weapon more To save his friends than harm his foes. And when increased the wild uproar, And more intense the tussle grew, Himself with wild delight he threw Into the press as it had been Some headlong, jovial, schoolboy scene, ‘King-seal-ye!’—football—any game Might more than usual daring claim. VIII. While thus engaged, it chanced the youth Full upon Whetu-riri came; And with a moment's shock in truth That back his blood's quick current sent, Found his revolver's barrels spent! Himself in fact unarmed before The Chief who down upon him bore, But paused until he joyful saw The pistol never raised to fire; Then out his tongue was thrust—his jaw Aside—his eyes turned back—his face Distorted with the grim grimace, His sign of hate, defiance, ire; High whirled his axe for one sure blow To lay his helpless victim low. But Ranolf rallying swift as light Or lightning, leaping forward, dashed (Before the axe could downward sweep) His clenched right hand with all his might And the momentum of his leap, Full into that grimacing grin; And made the astonished savage spin— While fast his rolling eyeballs flashed With other gleams than fury lent— Clean o'er the ditch's sheer descent Amid the smouldering stakes that crashed Beneath him as he headlong went, Wondering what demon could assist The weight of that hard English fist.— “Kapai! ka nui pai!—Well done! O right well done!” a hoarse voice cried— Old Tangi's—at his topmost run As rushing round the palisade That brief encounter he espied And hastened to the young man's aid. IX. —A grisly sight in sooth was he That huge exulting Chief to see, As there with lowered axe he stood And Whetu's smashing fall surveyed! From his broad axe-blade dripped and drained The blood; and all with hostile blood His hoary hair and beard were stained; With drops of fierce exertion rained His brow; his chest—so rugged, vast, And muscle-woven like the twist Of cable-cords some olive rears, Some mighty trunk eight hundred years Have seen in rocky strength resist Their rending frost and raging heat;— Like some great engine working fast, That knotty chest quick-heaving beat: So stood the Giant in his glee In friendly hideous ecstasy! But scarce could toil or triumph check His course an instant; on he went (As Ranolf leaving clear his road Back to the barrier stepped to load) On towards his prostrate breathless prey,— That fallen ‘Star,’—with fell intent To dash his life out where he lay. But ere he reached him, to his feet Up sprung Te Whetu, bold, erect— Though still his blue-lined face streamed red With that well-planted blow's effect; At first prepared his foe to meet; But seemed an instant to reflect; The tough encounter seemed to dread: Then shouting bade his men retreat, And o'er the flat deliberate fled. Swift passed the word from man to man, And swiftly leaping down they ran On all sides from the leaguered fort. Three steps to follow, Tangi took, With glad but half-astonished look; And then in full career stopped short; Smiled sternly with disdainful lip; And pulling with his finger-tip His under eyelid down in scorn— “Is this your mutton-fish! Am I Your greenhorn!” was his haughty cry; For all the plan was patent then,— To draw him to the open plain, Where his slight force though stanch and good, No chance against their numbers stood. So, with the crowd though onward borne A moment, back he forced his men; Bade them for very shame restrain Their shouts of ‘Victory,’ yet to gain; And soon had all except the slain Safe in the fort, to counsel there How best they might the wall repair— How best to meet—forestall—defeat, The next assault their foes might dare. Canto the Fourth. Fight between ‘Sounding Sea’ and ‘Angry Star.’ 1. The assault renewed. 2. A new device. 3. Amohia in the flames. 4. The ‘Angry Star’ and ‘Sounding Sea’—hand to hand. Ranolf to the rescue. 5. The ‘Striker-in-the-Dark.’ Tangi wounded. 6. The ‘Gourd.’ I. Short breathing time the ‘Angry Star’ Gave Tangi, nor retreated far. Soon as he saw his feint to draw The veteran from his Fort had failed, Again he marshalled all his band Upon the flat beside the shore. Then with a new device though planned Before, with hearts and hopes new-fanned And by the cunning Priest beguiled With omens sure and safe, once more The stubborn stronghold they assailed. With songs and yells and gestures wild In swarms across the ditch they swept; In swarms the broken barrier leapt; Once more by casual shots annoyed Around the platform swift deployed. Again—scarce waiting their attack— The fiery Chief, whom neither age Nor odds nor toil made slow or slack, Had sallied forth to force them back, Or hand-to-hand at least engage The first who scaled that fighting-stage. So all the terrace circling round The ramparts, as before, was crowned With thronging men in deadly broil O'erthrown—o'erthrowing; a dark coil Convulsive, fluctuating, dense, Of agonizing forms confused, In every violent posture used In mad attack or tough defence! A mass of spears and clubs that crossed And clashed, and limbs that twined and tossed, As leathery links of seaweed lithe At ebbing tide on rock-reefs writhe: And all the forms and limbs exact In statuesque proportions cast— Dark symmetry of strength compact, Where working muscles rose and fell With shifting undulations fast As poppling wavelets when the breeze The tiderip grates in narrow seas! Till all that ring of wrestlings rife, Continuous knots of naked strife, Had seemed, to looker-on at ease, Some crowded Phigaleian frieze Or Parthenaic miracle Of Art awaked to sudden life— Or worked in terra-cotta, say, Brown Lapithæ in deadly fray; Large-limbed Theseian heroes old, But darkly dyed, of kindred race, Whose naked forms of classic mould In one wide-raging death-embrace Their naked struggling foes enfold. II. But when the fight was at its height His new device Te Whetu tried. Up-rushed a shouting band outside The black-charred fence before laid low. In order good, a double row They came; each warrior of the first Poising a platted green-flax sling Well wetted in the nearest spring; And in the sling a red-hot stone, Which, high above the ramparts thrown Should soon make such a blaze outburst From walls of rush and roofs of thatch As might the whole defences catch, And force the stifled foe to fly The Fort he held so stubbornly. The second rank bore, close behind, In baskets green with earth safe-lined, Of heated stones a fresh supply. Then, at a signal given they hurl A burning volley, thick and hot As soft red lumps of scoria whirl, In showers from dark abysses shot By old Vesuvius in his play, His common freaks of every day, When all his lava floods repose: Or such as o'er his creviced snows The grander Tongaríro throws— While dread reverberations round His sulphurous crater-depths resound— When all the solemn midnight skies With that red beacon of surprise He startles—seeming from afar Though low upon the horizon's bound Sole object in the vault profound! So baleful glares its fiery shine, To all the tribes an ominous sign Of death and wide disastrous war. —Now, now, alert and active be, Ye children of the ‘Sounding Sea!’ Your shifty foes will else make good The threats erelong that boastful song Sent echoing late o'er vale and wood!— Not wholly unprepared they speed To baulk and baffle if they may Their fierce assailant's fresh essay. For they had seen above the green The smoke of fires lit up when need Was none of fires for warmth or food; And soon the project understood. So all the gourds they could provide Were ready, every house beside; And even a large canoe to be Their tank in this extremity Hauled up and fitly placed;—all filled With water from a well, supplied Itself by channels issuing through The rock upon the Lake, below Its surface cut; their outlet so From keenest-eyed besiegers' view Well-hidden by its waters blue. And when that shower of firestones red Came whirling, whizzing overhead, For this vocation primed and drilled, All those whom duty did not call To watch the gates, defend the wall— The old by age outworn, the young With sinews yet for fight unstrung— And young or old, the women too, With Amohia first of all,— Quick to the calabashes flew Or tottered as they best could do. And when the slightest whiff of smoke From any roof or rush-wall broke, Some hand was prompt the place to drench And ere it spread, the burning quench. III. But Amo, first among the crowd, With cheery accents, low not loud, As if at once their hearts to warm To effort, yet repress alarm— With smiles upon her face—howe'er Her heart might throb with secret care— Seemed ever everywhere at hand, To guide, encourage, cheer, command! And once when fire broke out indeed And none just then appeared to heed, Nor quick enough the water came— Up to the roof she leapt, she sprung, And o'er the thatch her mantle flung, And trampled out the mounting flame.— With arms and that firm bosom bare, In skirt of glossy flax, as there Aloft in such excited mood Hurrying her hastening handmaids, stood The dauntless Girl—she looked as rare For spirit, grace, commanding mien, As loveliest Amazonian Queen In those surpassing friezes seen! IV. But while this passed upon the hill The fight below was raging still; And that resistless ‘Sounding Sea’ At last had met the enemy Whose death the most, of all the heap Of slaughter his remorseless blade That day, a bloody harvest, made, The haughty Veteran cared to reap. With satisfaction stern and deep To feel his foe within his power, He hurled—through clenching teeth that ground As if with grim resolve that hour Should be the last of both or one And see the hateful contest done— Defiance at “the slave—the hound!” Then rushed upon him with a shower Of blows of such terrific power And weight and swiftness, left and right— The ‘Angry Star,’ who tried in vain The pelting tempest to sustain, Was backward borne in self-despite, Parrying the blows as best he might; Ducking his head from side to side Like tortured tree that scarce can bide The beating of a gusty gale. But Tangi's breath begins to fail, The driving blows at length relax; Less swiftly whirls his battle-axe; And Whetu in his turn attacks; But stalking round and round his foe And watching where a blow to plant, As runs a Tiger crouching low Around some wary Elephant, For chance, with viewless lightning-spring His weight to launch upon the haunch Of the dread monster and escape The white destruction that in shape Of those impaling tusks still gleams Before him—still to face him seems Turn where his eyes' green lustres may! So watched Te Whetu when to fling Himself upon that warrior grey— So round him plied his swinging stride; Then flew at him with yell and blow 'Twas well for Tangi, eye and hand Were quick enough to slant aside— And tough enough his battle-brand Its sweeping fury to withstand. Then such a whirling maze began Of clattering weapons—stroke and guard And feint and parry, thrust and ward, As up and down the axes ran Together, that no sharpest eye Could follow their rapidity! But Tangi, see! has clutched at last Te Whetu by a necklace fast The boastful savage ever wore Of warriors' teeth, a ghastly wreath— And twists it hard his foe to choke, And shortens for a final stroke His axe's hold—but fails once more— The treacherous chain beneath the strain Breaks, scattering wide the hideous beads. Back springs Te Whetu—free again, The deadly strife may still maintain: Close follows Tangi; mad to be Baulked of so sure a victory, The road beneath him little heeds: His step upon a spot is set Where the hard clay is slippery wet With gore; he slips—he stumbles o'er A wounded wretch unseen who lies Right in his path, on crimsoned stones And dust that chokes a ruddy rill Slow-creeping but increasing still— Lies in the pathway there—with eyes That anguished roll, heartrending groans, And writhings like a centipede's Caught in a burning log—and bleeds. Down, down the Giant goes before His Foe, who now began to rave With joy at this unwonted run Of luck his favouring Atuas gave! Ere Tangi—old—with toil o'erdone— Could raise him from his heavy fall, He whirled his poleaxe high to end Him and his triumphs, once for all.— The blow was never to descend; For at that instant at full speed Up Ranolf ran to save his friend: There was no time for thought, nor need: Three balls in swift succession sent Through Whetu's body crashing went, Down drops his axe—his arms upthrown— His eyes a moment wildly glare, Then glaze with fixed and ghastly stare; His staggering knees give way,—and there He lies a corpse without a groan! A pang smote Ranolf—though he knew There was nought else for him to do. Slowly rose Tangi; dauntless still; And half-disposed to take it ill That Ranolf's shot his debt should pay And from his clutches snatch his prey. V. But when Te Whetu's men beheld Their ‘Angry Star,’ their hero, slain; And Tangi up again, unquelled, With such triumphant fierce disdain Looking where next to dash among The thickest of the wavering throng;— Beheld that Stranger's bearing bold, And in his firm determined hold His life-devouring weapon raised; A terror seized the nearest band— Who since the duel first began Had breathless stood on either hand, Inactive; wondering, half-amazed What would the conflict's issue be 'Twixt ‘Angry Star’ and ‘Sounding Sea.’— Through all the host the panic ran: Down from the platform headlong leapt The foremost fighting-men, and swept Along with them the slingers too And all the pebble-carrying crew! Then Tangi, for he saw the rout Was real this time, began to shout To all his clansmen to come out, Pursue and press the flying foe, And smite and spare not high or low— No glut of dear revenge forego! But short his course—his triumph short; For as he turned him—and addrest To those behind a brief behest That some should stay to guard the Fort, A bullet pierced his rugged breast, Out of a near plantation fired By some obscure assailant hid Behind a fence—ensconced amid The rattling stems of withered maize— A parting gift ere he retired; 'Twas Márupo, so named to mark His ways—the ‘Striker-in-the-Dark.’— Down sinks the Chieftain—to the ground Bowed down by that slight-seeming wound; Yet makes fierce efforts still to raise The fainting form one elbow stays: Still keeps erect that dizzying head, And lifts the arm that weighs like lead, And feebly cries a battle-cry Of Vengeance and of Victory! Still cheers with broken words and brief His men, with horror struck and grief To see thus fall'n their honoured Chief; But most exhausts his gasping breath In bidding them avenge his death By such a havoc of his foes As shall illume where'er it goes The tale of his inglorious close.— His life-blood ebbing, thus he steeled His old brave heart, nor yet would yield To be transported from the field; Less heeding death than this disgrace To fall by hand obscure or base: Cursing the coward tools that gave Such easy power to every slave To slay the foe he durst not face!— But while the most his hest obeyed, With Ranolf some about him stayed; And with their sturdy tender aid, The Chief whom nothing could persuade, But senseless could resist no more, Into the nearest house he bore. VI. Meantime among the host that fled And few that followed, quickly spread The rumour Tangi too was dead; And of the fugitives ahead The foremost and least scared began To make their comrades as they ran Note their pursuers—far and few— Their own o'erwhelming numbers too. They pause—they turn; collect in knots About the ruined garden-plots; Not unobserved of him, in place Of Tangi now who led the chase, A wary warrior ‘Máwai’ named;— ‘Máwai—the Gourd’—because far-famed For many a crafty deep design By sap and trench and secret mine For creeping into forts—unstayed By tallest post and palisade; As sure, though unperceived and slow, As over fences high or low That creeping climbing gourd will grow;— Máwai amid the shrubs and trees The foe in clusters rallying sees: So shouts the danger out to all His headlong comrades within call; Rates—reasons—threats—entreats and makes All whom his step or voice o'ertakes Keep more together—rest content Just now at least with what was done, The vengeance taken—victory won. And thus, with caution, by degrees, And often turning as they went As if to ferret out and slay Chance fugitives that hiding lay— So that a front they still present To that recovering enemy In crowds tumultuous hovering nigh, And make him doubt their true intent,— The scanty band of victors back To their intrenchments take their way; Their Fort unconquered still, though black And reeking from the late attack. Canto the Fifth. Love fed by War. 1. Amo tending her father. 2. Good springs from Evil. What if power to resist Evil have to be acquired; so a reason for its existence here? 3. Are Good and Evil opposite forces of one Power? True perhaps that Evil must exist, or only God. 4. Which better, stationary limited completeness; or imperfection with unlimited progress? Speculation idle. Action cures Doubt—how? 5. The enemy crest-fallen. I. But ere with Tangi Ranolf reached The Fort, the anxious Amo came— With more than one deep-wrinkled dame Of reputation unimpeached For skill medicinal—supplied With best resources from their store Kept ready and prepared before— Lint, splints and bands and simples dried— Came hasting to her Father's side. Soon as his dangerous state appears, She dashes off the starting tears; And sets to work the whimpering crones, And checks their loud untimely moans. Thus schooled, with old experienced eye And gentle hand, the nurses pry Into the wound, and probe, and try With styptic herbs well understood To check and stanch the oozing blood; With many a mild restorative And crooning incantation, strive His pausing pulses to revive; And back the flitting life allure With all they know to charm and cure! With anodynes they soothe his pains; And many a cooling drink restrains The fever in his feeble veins. By Amo's self, sad loving Child, The thick elastic mats are piled Whereon the helpless Chief they lay; By Amo's hands are softly spread The silkiest, for that poor grand head! Her tender hands alone essay To wash the battle-stains away; And smooth and comb with fondest care, His snowy beard and matted hair: While from her heart to those still skies, Sincere and fervent yearnings rise For aid, where'er it lives or lies, With any pitying deities!— For she to Ranolf's Gods will pray— Her father's—any Gods that may Save that dear life, that pain allay! And must not heartfelt wishes pure, Deep-breathings of a daughter's love, Be grateful to the Powers above, And of benignant hearing sure, As any prayers howe'er exprest, And to whate'er enlightened, best Ideal of Infinite God addrest?— II. And Ranolf, wondering, watched her glide— Mid all that carnage sanguine-dyed, And brutal savage homicide, And murderous passions raging wide— A Seraph of bright tenderness, A healing Angel, in distress Sent down to soothe—console and bless! And felt, to see her there and thus,— “How sad and beautiful a thing, How sordid, sad, and glorious, This human Nature is! where spring Out of each other, linked by fate, Such heavenly love, such hellish hate; What bred this vermin Hate?—Love's rose! Now, Love in Hate's vile hotbed blows!— If Evil root itself in Good, And Good must be evolved from Ill, Must not the Author of the Good Be Author of the Evil still? And we, to work his ends, must we For love of Good, the Evil flee, That without which it could not be?— Aye truly! if to be the seed Of Good, is Evil's end decreed, Enough, be sure, will still remain To raise the plant, howe'er we strain The seed's destruction to attain. Say, by the great Soul-Shaper's plan (Not quite a maze, not wholly dim) 'Tis Evil, tried and conquered, can Alone exalt ascending Man;— That just to win his way therein Unsoiled, unquelled, is asked of him; The very power, from this life freed, In loftier life he most may need! Then Evil's gauntlet he must run— Be plunged o'erhead in it, as one In water who would learn to swim; And stumbling often—oft o'erthrown Must risk it, as the Child ungrown Must risk the fall to go alone; Held ever by its Mother's hand, How should it learn to walk or stand? ‘'Twere better it were born complete, Set up at once on steady feet,’ Say you—‘could walk, swim, run at first— No need to have those weak limbs nurst!’ Nay, then the holiest ties that bless Our Nature you remove, repress— The Infant's love and soft caress, The Mother's depth of tenderness. III. So haply through all Being's round To this condition Good is bound, Evil in this alliance found; That each must to the other lead, And from the other each proceed. And are they then each other's dower, Two opposite forces of one Power, Indifferent, central? must we give Credence to that about the poles The positive and negative? Think that the still-contending twain (Magnetic double-acting vein) Ever towards equilibrium strain; Each when it finds a yielded space, Pressing to take the other's place? While to their union would we mount The ever mystic marvellous Fount Of Good and Evil, where they live In unimagined Essence bright Of Perfect, Necessary, Right, We come but to the Soul of Souls Unknowable, for aye unknown The Centre—God? whence issuing, still Is issuing into Good and Ill?— Who knows? but one thing might be shown: Some Evil there must be where'er Is Imperfection, foul or fair: Perfection by a hairbreadth missed Is Imperfection; you must say The One Allperfect every way Is God alone—what else but He?— It follows—Evil must exist Or God's the sole Existence be. IV. But say the Imperfect might be made Complete within its bounds—its grade— From every possible degree Of Evil done or suffered free— (Which none can prove)—with no desire As no conception of the higher: Would that a loftier lot have been? To rest, a faultless mere machine Bound down to automatic bliss Of stagnant Being—that, or this Which works through Darkness to the Light, Still struggling towards the highest height Perhaps in progress infinite?— Pooh—pooh!” within himself he said Breaking the speculative thread Short off;—for that tumultuous fight, His own exertions—and the sight Of Amo by her father's bed Working in strong affection's might To soothe and cheer his evil plight— Most keenly made him feel how vain, How sickly all the sceptic train Of thoughts on God, Man's doom or chance, And Nature's mystic governance: How true is Goethe's word—‘the cure For Doubt is Action;’ not indeed As making speculation sure— As solving any special doubt, Or settling any special creed, But making Doubt itself appear A thing impertinent and out Of place in this bright work-day sphere; And all that Speculation seem The maundering of a feverish dream; An idle growth, deficient both In fragrant flower and wholesome fruit; Like some white straggling ivy-sprout, Or sickly honeysuckle-shoot, That thrusts a pale and feeble trail Inside a darksome building's wall; But kept without, in light and heat, Had spread a green and graceful pall With feathery blossoms luscious-sweet O'er many a dreary blank or stain And blotch that else the eye would pain— Nor should have been allowed to crawl Into the inner dark at all. V. Crest-fallen—sullen at their ill-success, Across the Lake the sad assailants go; With murmurs, not even fear can quite suppress, Against the Priest—for omens so belied— And each against the other, as the first Who after such defeats new hopes had nursed, And on such omens would fresh faith bestow. With smooth cajolings Kangapo replied, Though deep chagrin and rage he scarce could hide; Showed how, the Fort half-burnt and Tangi killed, His prophecies had been wellnigh fulfilled; And if at last on any point they failed 'Twas that the white man's Atuas had prevailed O'er his—who shameless had their cause betrayed. But there were stronger Spirits to his aid He might have summoned had he been so willed; Had not too great contempt his bosom swayed For those strange Gods, and want of caution bred In one those Gods should yet be taught to dread! Thus much he owned; but this would soon repair; Only let not his faithful sons despair: By mightier Powers they soon should see o'erthrown His foes in spirit, and in flesh their own. But with his Atuas let him work alone That night;—when daybreak glimmered should be shown What they must do; how best this juncture meet, And make their partial victory complete. So urged the glozing Priest, his only aim To gain more time to patch his tattered Fame; Or find an opportunity to leave Those he scarce hoped much longer to deceive. They seemed to listen—feigned their fear dispelled; Then their own agitated councils held; Some to contrive new measures to achieve The Priest's designs and their defeat retrieve; Most to devise safe means without delay To get themselves and their canoes away From the increasing dangers of their stay. Canto the Sixth. An old wrong avenged. 1. Enemy retreating. 2. Night. 3. Watch-song. 4. Ranolf's expedition. 5–6. A capture. 7. Daylight watch-song. 8. Tangi's ire. I. That eve a thought struck Ranolf, as he stood Watching the foe retreat in sullen mood— Brown barebacked bending crowds, and each canoe Its ruddy sides white-spotted with a row Of tufted feathers, paddling, silent, slow, With wake wide-rippling, o'er the Lake—light-blue As silver-shining skin of fish new-caught— Towards hills, of burnished copper cauldron's hue With the departing sunset; landing then, How, like dispirited, distracted men, In huddling knots they flocked and flitted—used Gesticulations, violent, confused, Conflicting, undetermined; while alone The Priest to his secluded cot had gone, How meditative, silent!—then a thought Struck Ranolf, of a deed that might be done Would yield rich harvest with the morning sun. Oft through the pocket spy-glass thrown ashore When he was wrecked and which just now he wore, He from the island had observed before How Kangapo from motives quickly guessed Had made his temporary place of rest Apart from all the crowd and tumult; screened By the low spur of hill that intervened From that familiarity which breeds Contempt—(for hollow-glittering men and deeds!) And knowing well their superstitious fear From friends or foes would keep him safe and clear. Thus by the waterside alone he dwelt, Nor any fear of their annoyance felt. II. 'Twas dead of night; the stars with clouds were blurred: Within the fort the wearied warriors lay And slept or still discussed the deadly fray. As noiselessly as Sunbeams on the plain That shine and shift and fade and shine again, Bright Amo tended Tangi's fevered pain. Solemn and deep—distinct in every word, The intermittent watch-song might be heard O'er the monotonous, moaning, plaintive strain Of women wailing for their kinsmen slain, In groups, with heads down-bent upon their knees— A musical low tremulous hum like bees— Or swelling high like far-off murmuring seas; But o'er it rose the watch-song clear and plain: For even the sentinels as round and round With frequent pause they paced the higher ground, Had many a chaunt and metaphoric snatch Of verse, to while the tedium of their watch; (Say ye, the wise, O worthy of all praise, Who toil, with tokens from forgotten days The veil from that grand mystery to raise The origin of Man and all his ways— Say through what inborn need, what instinct strong, These savage races are such slaves to Song!) But these, the watchers round Mokoia's fort Were sounding through the gloom, in phrases short By snatches given, a song against surprise,— Half chaunt—half shouts, deep melancholy cries Whose purport feebler paraphrase alone Can give—the sense that to themselves it gave; For the simplicity of that rude stave Was so severe, its literal words made known Were almost gibberish in their brevity: Only dilution can lend any zest Or nutriment a stranger could digest To song in short-hand, verse so cramped—comprest, The very pemmican of poetry: III. “Be wakeful—O be watchful! men at every post around; Lest on a barren rock hemmed in at morning ye be found! Hemmed in—blocked up—cut off, by the advancing tide; O watchful, wakeful be—sharp-eared and lightning-eyed! By Hari-hari's shore the beetling cliffs (O wakeful be!) Are at all times and tides beset by the beleaguering Sea. O watchful, wakeful be! when women wail for warriors lost, 'Tis like the high-complaining surf on Mokau's sounding coast.— Ay me! Ay me! still creeping nigher—still swarming up and trying Each ledge where seamews light—where'er their young ones nestle, prying!— Not so—not so, on us the foe shall steal—yet wakeful be— O watchful, wakeful till the Sun spring glorious from the Sea!”— IV. So rolled the solemn Song the darkness through, As Ranolf with two lads—his trustiest two, Whose faith was greatest in himself, he knew; From all the rest dissembling his design Nor letting even these two its end divine, Stole from the fort and launched a light canoe; Then softly paddled o'er the Lake until They dimly could discern the looming hill Where Kangapo resided; there they paused Intently listening—paddled on once more— (A low wind sighing scarce a ripple caused) Then cautiously approached the darksome shore, Some distance from the glen; the keelless prore Slid smoothly up the pumice-sandy marge: Then out stepped Ranolf, giving strictest charge The two should wait there till his quick return, When they the object of their voyage should learn. V. So Ranolf stepped upon the strand; His foot scarce craunched the gritty sand; A flax-rope wound his waist around— Revolver ready in his hand. With eye and ear alert and keen For dimmest sight or faintest sound, In that lone, dark and silent scene His stealthy way he quickly found: That way he oft before had been; That cottage lone had been his own; Each woody rolling spur and dell And wavy cliff to which they fell, Cut off below,—he knew full well. With noiseless pace he neared the place— Stood listening hid by shrubs thick-grown. No sign of life he saw or heard But distant murmurs; nothing stirred. On tiptoe to the hut he went; Close to the wall his ear he leant, And while his own light breathing ceased Could hear the breathing of the Priest; Could hear his sighs—his mutterings low And restless shiftings to and fro.— “Awake—then; and too dark 'twould be Inside for me my work to see!” Thought Ranolf—“how to bring him out? The foe so near, their noise I hear; He must be left no time to shout.” A rustling noise along the thatch Like stealthy rats that creep and scratch, He made—“his ear 'twill surely catch! With sounds like these along the wall The Atuas come at priestly call.”— Small notice seemed the Priest to take:— The muttering voice a moment dropped; The train of sad reflections stopped; He listened—then the gloomy train Of muttered thoughts began again; More certain sign the Gods must make Their votary's dull regard to wake! His pistol stuck in that rope-belt,— Then Ranolf lifted up with care A heavy cooking-stone he felt About his feet—left always there— And pitched it full upon the roof; The stealthy rustling noise renewed; His pistol drew, and ready stood: “Against a summons so divine, Of present Gods so sure a sign, His priestly ear will ne'er be proof!—” —Bewildered—wondering—all subdued By strange and superstitious fright, Out rushed the Priest into the night— Rushed into Ranolf's gripe that clutched About his throat his mat so tight While his scared brow the pistol touched— Of Ranolf's threat was little need: “Hist, wretch! the pistol's at your head— The slightest noise—and you are dead!” He could not speak, scarce breathe indeed, Till from that rivet somewhat freed. VI. Thus grappled, to the beach below, Till out of hearing of the foe, Ranolf his cowering captive led; Then on a sudden, turning round, Tripped up and threw him on the ground; While the poor Sorcerer, sore dismayed, Believing his last moment come, For life, for mercy, whimpering prayed. Nought answered Ranolf; stern and dumb, His knee upon his chest he placed; Unwound the cord about his waist; And quick the Sorcerer's mantle rolled, Leaving enough for breathing loose, About his head and frightened face: Then, from his sea-experience old, Expert at every tie and noose, In briefest space contrived to lace And truss his victim up from nape Of neck to sole of foot compact; Till chance was none of his escape. “There, friend! for that kind trick you played Me once, I think you're well repaid.”— Then to the hut again he tracked His hasty steps; against the door A sketch-book-leaf prepared before He stuck, with this inscription fit, In letters large in Maori writ: “Kua kawakína—e—te Tóhunga; Kia túpato apópo, mo te há—te há!” “Your sorcerer from your side is torn; Beware, beware to-morrow morn!” Beneath was sketched for signature The dreaded pistol—token sure To all the foe, if none could read, Whence came the message—whose the deed. Then back to where his helpless prey With muffled moanings writhing lay, Just like a chrysalis that works Its head and tail with useless jerks Cramped by the sheath wherein it lurks— He sped; hailed softly through the dark The lads expectant with their bark; And helped by these, who little knew Their gruesome captive, packed him safe, Nor daring now to moan or chafe, Beneath the thwarts of the canoe; And to the isle, all danger past, In triumph soon was paddling fast. VII. But when with quickened stroke they strove, And up the beach the vessel drove With many a cheer—they just could hear On high the sentries' livelier lay Begin to greet the breaking day: “Stars are fleeting; Night retreating— Yellow-stealing Dawn begun! Slowly, mark! Uplifts the dark— See, first a spark—then all the Sun! Birds are singing, Forests ringing, Hark, O hark! Danger flies with daylight springing; O rejoice—your watch is done!”— But when the invading host next day Found their great bulwark, guide and stay Borne off in this mysterious way, A panic seized them, one and all! No further councils would they call; Their planned retreat became a flight, And all had disappeared ere night. VIII. Much trouble it cost Ranolf when 'twas known What captive thus into their hands was thrown, To save his forfeit life; for Tangi's ire Against the scheming traitor burnt like fire. But generous still, and holding hardly worth His vengeance, one who never from his birth Had been a warrior, he at last gave way, Much wondering at the stranger's strange desire To save the victim he had power to slay. So, hiding all his hatred, much increased By Ranolf's kindly act, the dangerous Priest, Scarce seeming sullen, spiteful or morose, Was for the present kept a prisoner close. Canto the Seventh. Death of the ‘Sounding Sea.’ 1. Tangi wastes away. 2. Defies death. 3. Ceremonies at his decease. 4. His idea of ‘Heaven’ and (5) ‘Trust in God.’ 6. His burial. I. Wasting and weakening ever, day by day, The ‘Sounding Sea,’ deep-wounded, lingering lay; Or heavily dragged about his gaunt great frame, With hollowing cheeks, and eyes that yet would flame When news about his late assailants came, And how his gallant clansmen on all hands Made deadly havoc of their scattered bands. The fatal ball that pierced his massive chest Had torn an opening to his lungs their art Could never close, although it healed in part; So that whene'er the gasping Chieftain drew A labouring breath, the air came hissing through; At which in pure self-scorn he oft would jest, Laugh a faint echo of his old great laugh, And say he was already more than half A ghost, and talked the language of the dead, The whistling tones of spirits that have fled; And Kangapo had best beware, or he Would worry him, for all his witchery! —But most he loved to spend his scanty breath In urging all who stood his couch beside To hold their own, whatever might betide; Whate'er the odds, the arms, the Chiefs renowned Assailed them, still unblenched to keep their ground, And never, never yield—but fight till death! And, when too weak to rise, his race nigh run,— He made them lift him out into the sun: Had all his favourite weapons round him laid— The weapons of his glory, youth, and pride; And these, while memory with old visions played Of many a furious fight and famous raid, He feebly handled—proudly, fondly eyed: That heavy batlet bright of nephrite pure, Green, smooth and oval as a cactus leaf— “How heavy!” sighed he with a moment's grief; But then what blows it dealt, how deadly sure— Its fame and his for ever must endure! And that great battleaxe, from many a field Notched, hacked and stained, he could no longer wield, How many a warrior's fate that blade had sealed!— The others to his kinsmen he bequeathed, But these he could not part with while he breathed. Then all the muskets he could boast—but few— And even his powder-kegs were set in view. These were the Gods on whom he placed his trust To guard and keep his tribe when he was dust; These were the sacred symbols—holy books— Whereon for comfort dwelt his dying looks. II. —Thus, all his Soul, in gesture, word and thought, One blaze of high defiance of the power Of Death to quell or quench it—thus he fought The grisly Tyrant to his latest hour; As Tongariro's fires flare upward red And fierce, against the blackest clouds that shed Their stormy torrents on his shrouded head!— The Priest, in place of Kangapo supplied, Sung ceaseless incantations at his side; On him or them but little he relied. And when the inevitable talons fast Clutched his old heathen hero-heart at last; When life's large flame slow-flickering fell and rose, Death's shadows flapping closer and more close, Still his unconquered Spirit strove to wave Its fluttering standard of defiance high; And “Kia tóa—kia tóa! O be brave, Be brave, my Sons!”—he gasped with broken cry! Then as the rattling throat and back-turned eye Told his last moment come, the restless Priest, With zeal to frenzy at the sight increased, Seizing his shoulders, shook him to set free His Spirit in its parting agony; And bending o'er that dying head down-bowed, Into its heedless ear kept shouting loud: “Now, now, be one with the wide Light, the Sun! With Night and Darkness, O be one, be one!”— III. Then rushed the men about with furious yells; Then clubs were brandished—every musket fired; The women shrilled, and as stern use required Their bosoms gashed with sharpened flints and shells; Dogs barked and howled, the more the warriors leapt; The Priest, like one mad-raving or inspired, Still shouting his viaticum untired! So while both men and women, old and young Seemed by some demon to distraction stung— Though Amo, better taught by Ranolf, kept More self-command and only moaned and wept,— So while this stormy hubbub round him swept, The mighty Chief—the ‘Sounding Sea,’ expired. IV. Thus Tangi died;—not vastly grieved or vexed To leave this world—or grave about the next. He had his Heaven, be sure; where warriors brave Found all the luxuries their rude tastes would crave; Transparent greenstone glorious, in excess, And lovelier-streaked than language could express; Fair-tinted feathercrests of stateliest plume; Rare flaxen robes of silkiest glossiness; Roots of the richest succulence, perfume And flavour, more than famine could consume; And beauteous women of unwithering bloom! All this would lure them, lapt in skies, serene As on the long sweet summer-days are seen When silver-cradled clouds soft-piled upturn Their innocent white faces to the Sun; Or spread o'er all the abyss of light a screen Snowy and delicate and overrun With little cracks, unequal network fine, Like those through which the firelogs' red hearts shine While at the surface ashenwhite they burn.— Of Paradise no lofty notion this— Yet their ideal no less, of perfect bliss. And whose is more?—Of all the heavens divulged, Is there not still one staple, worst and best? Sense, mental powers or moral, all indulged And exercised with mightier sway and zest: On infinite Perfection, say, entranced In rapturous rest to dwell; or work its will, With nobler strengths, aims evermore advanced:— 'Tis but your highest bliss you look for still! You wish for the best state you can conceive, Or something better which to God you leave; To self-denying selfishness hold fast— Denying Self as best for Self at last: Who so unselfish as consent to fall At last to lower life or none at all? So 'tis for Happiness you press and pray— The state most blest, define it how you may. Are then your motives less by interest marred— Your self-devotion greater, self regard Much less than his—the heathen's—who so true, So stanch and faithful to his simple creed Of Courage for his Tribe's well-being, threw His life away to win it, nor would deign To waste a sigh upon his loss or pain; And self-forgetful still, no more would heed His gain—his not exceeding great reward, That heaven of sweet potatoes?—yet confess The merit greater as the meed was less. V. Nor haply should his “trust in God” be scorned, Because, not naming Him whom none can name, It was but Confidence, upheld the same, By praises, prayers, professions unadorned, In what was Right, his Duty, so he felt; Because in that unconsciousness he dwelt Much more upon the Duty to be done To win it, than the guerdon to be won; So did the Duty; cared for nought beside; And let his Gods for all the rest provide. VI. Two days in state the Chieftain's body lay, In arms, mats, feathers, all his best array; And women wailed and musket-volleys rung And funeral dirges were in chorus sung, Which likened him to things below—above— Best worth their admiration, pride and love; Most precious trinkets of the greenstone jade— Canoe-prows carved with most elaborate blade, And trees of stateliest height—most sheltering shade;— Bade fiery mountains open to admit Their hero to the Reinga's gloomy pit;— Made breezes sigh and boiling geysers groan In cavernous depths for their great Warrior gone; Bade Tu, the God of War, look favouring down; And all the mighty Shades of old renown Welcome a Spirit who among them came Proud as themselves, and of congenial fame! Then to some secret cave and catacomb, Of all their nobly born the ancient tomb, In long procession slow, with chaplets crowned Of fresh-plucked leaves, their dirge-timed way they wound: There left the dead Form couched in lonely state, The annual-rounding Sun's return to wait; Then to be taken out with reverent care, And the dry bones, corruption-clogged—laid bare— With songs and savage rites and dances wild, Cleansed from all fleshly fragments of decay; And 'mid white skulls and skeletons up-piled, In that most dreaded Sanctuary laid away. BOOK THE SEVENTH. SELF-SACRIFICE. Canto the First. Weariness. 1. Amo's exhaustless love. 2. Ranolf pines for civilized life. 3. Her efforts to amuse him. 4. Ranolf cannot conceal their failure. 5. Can he take her away with him? I. Alas! that human Happiness should never Like those fair-flowing snowy fringes be, That down Mahana's geyser-terraced hill Grow into permanence as they distil; In loveliness of marble mimicry There, in the act of falling, fixed for ever!— Alas! that Love's best transports may— Like rills that dance and gleam and glance, In loveliest forms of foam and spray Down common cataracts every day— So swiftly cease their sparkling play; Though Love—the River's self—below As deep or deeper still may flow! The days rolled on—as dark or bright they will; And found those lovers fondly loving still. Could chance or change or circumstance destroy Fair Amo's fondness for her bright Sea-boy? Hers was a love exhaustless as the Ocean; Her heart unwearied—as his waves with motion— With restless play of passionate devotion. Her pure profound Affection could outpour Its tender tributes from an endless store, With lavish waste diminishing no more Than his with rolling snow-wreaths on the shore. Enraptured in the presence of the Lord And Idol of her young imagination, Her Soul seemed always in the act to bless— Her Spirit in a posture that adored; Each look seemed love—each gesture a caress; And every breath a yearning aspiration! Though half the gems with which her Idol glowed And won her worship, she herself bestowed— Her heart was an unworked Golconda-mine, Unconscious as 'twas careless, what a dower— As a volcano might its scoria-shower— It flung of diamond-fancies on the shrine And round the Deity it made divine. The knowledge—courage—courtesy—whate'er In mind or body might be found, of fair Intelligent or brave in him she loved, By her fresh bosom's fond illusive pride Were all sublimed, transfigured, glorified, Beyond the reach of her and hers removed,— As are some landscapes' beauties you survey With head downbent, and such new charms diffuse That woods and plains are in transcendent hues Of tenderest richness floated far away. II. Was she not happy then?—what shadow stole Over her full contentedness of soul?— It was that as the days less swiftly flew A weariness o'er Ranolf's spirit grew; Not of her charms or her—for none the less He loved his Wonder of the Wilderness. But that the Life he led of savage ease The more it was prolonged, seemed less to please. Perhaps his love of roving was too strong, Too deep-engrained to be quiescent long: But this was not a conscious need, nor would Have been the parent of his present mood. It was the crave for intellectual food, For which a young enthusiast Thinker pines, Who daringly has tasted of the Tree Forbidden still, of Knowledge of a Good Beyond the actual still to be pursued In all things to all ends; an Evil still To be assailed by Reason still more free, By wider Love and more exalted Will. It was the crave for Books—the mighty mines Where all the extinguished forests of mankind In diamond-thoughts lie crystallized—enshrined: And 'twas the haply sadder doom to be Excluded from the guidance—sympathy— The fellowship or presence of the prime Of men who towards the Light the highest climb; And head the onslaught of the human Mind Against the strongholds of dim Destiny. Ambition—progress—all the hope and pride Of true Existence seemed to him denied. That land so rich in Beauty's sensuous smile Seemed for the Soul, only a desert Isle. If ever chance-sent rumours reached his ear Of the great Nations in their grand career, They seemed dim records of aerial hosts Who struggled in the heavens—or shadowy ghosts. All the loud wonder-throes of peace or war Seemed melted to a murmur faint and far! What marvel if a feeling would intrude Of something wanting in this solitude?— Was it a treason to almighty Love This sense of unfulfilled desire to prove? Could any Love in any Paradise Howe'er impassioned, mutual, melting, true— Alone for any lovers long suffice?— Not poets' dreams can make it ever new— Not even a bridling dove can always coo! III. And anxious Amo could not but perceive His thoughts were often wandering far away; Her keen-eyed love would note, and inly grieve, The shadow on his features once so gay. The very love that to her faithful breast So magnified the merits he possessed— On which to dwell and feel them all her own Were highest bliss to be conceived or known— Made her inclined to rate herself too low; With timid doubt it could indeed be so, That such a treasure was reserved for her! And often to her memory would recur With what a glow he answered her demand To paint the Beauties of his native Land. And when her fond eye marked—more frequent now, His sad abstracted air and troubled brow, She could not check the thought, how full of woe, “Ah! he is pining for those charms, I know, Those lovely beings all of light and snow! O my o'erweening pride to think that he The glorious one, could be content with me!—” Then would she seek the saddened heart to ease, And ply with simple craft her arts to please; With skilful change her finest mantles choose Of broadest purfle and the fairest hues; Their folds around her shapely shoulders place Or dainty waist in each remembered way He most had praised for piquancy and grace: Or the soft glitter of her lustrous hair— So glossy black, the lights thrown off would play In sharp metallic gleams of bluish gray— In crimson flowers he loved her so to wear Or wax-white creeper-wreaths, she would array, With chance-taught Taste so sure—such careless Care! Or she would set herself a serious task, Through tangled woods and thickets dense to range In search of plants and insects—else despised— Because he took in them an interest strange She knew not why and scarcely cared to ask, Since 'twas enough they were by Ranolf prized. Or she would summon all her Damsels gay, To lively dance or sportive game, that best Would dexterous skill or native grace display: Or send them on a harvest-gathering quest Of clustering purple-fringes whence they squeeze Sweet jellies ruby-clear; because the sight Once seemed his fancy so to strike and please Of these wild Wood-nymphs trooping through the trees Back with their mirth-lit eyes—teeth glittering white With laughter—tresses floating on the breeze, And cheeks and foreheads in their reckless mood All dashed and splashed with crimson berry-blood; Like nymphs that frolic reeled in Bacchic dance In Nature's golden-aged exuberance, Or with goat-borne Silenus loved to romp In grape-empurpled grace and tipsy pomp! IV. And Ranolf would her loving purpose guess; And chide himself that he could not repress The weary longing that would o'er him steal; And force a gaiety he could not feel; And show her deeper love and double tenderness. But how should this content her? whose sole aim Was to light up the old gladness in his eyes; And little cared what of herself became, Were that secured at any sacrifice; But gained from true love far too keen a glance To be deceived by any simulance Of feeling, or affectionate pretence;— Is not true Love the Mesmerizer true— Beyond material Nature and above; Clear-seeing, with its supernatural sense The sympathetic object through and through? Into its inmost being swift to dart, In strange emotion take magnetic part, And throb with beatings of the loved one's heart? So Ranolf fondly sought—but sought in vain From those fond eyes to hide his inward pain. V. What could be done? could he then bear her hence, A wondering Wilding to his native land, A savage wife! Ah what a startling shock To prejudices like a wall of rock Sense-based or senseless—piled on every hand! Could he find fortitude or impudence The ridicule and censure to withstand Wisdom and folly would alike dispense? Could he endure to be the mark or mock For open pity—secret insolence? To friends and kindred such a stumbling-block Of deep and irremediable offence? Ah could he brave all this?—But graver care It was, how Amo such a change could bear? Could this bright Child of woods and waters thrive In the hot crowding of our social hive— Though not like its mere honey-workers tasked, Though only for such lightsome labour asked, Such sweet monotony of toil as there The partner of his moderate means must share?— This life, self-guided by her will or whim— Could she resign it for confinement dim, Cooped round with indoor comfort—too secure? Give up bright careless ease and breathing pure In azure liberty of Sun and Air, To choke in some fine atmosphere of nice Punctilios and proprieties precise? Be drilled into the trite and tedious round Of petty duties, poor amusements, found In formal life by strict conventions bound?— Or could it flourish, this wild-flowering Tree, Transparent with the sunbeams flowing free Through its white cloud of blossom—nailed and trained Espalier-wise against the rigid Wall Of civilized existence—shorn of all Its shoots of natural beauty—every spray Checked in its impulses of artless play— And all its waving wanton boughs constrained And tortured into stiff and starch array, In straightened uniformity controlled Like iron grate-bars regular and cold?— Or could the Tree transplanted long endure The chill and rigour of a rougher sky? The beautiful Exotic would be sure In such ungenial clime to droop and die! Nay (for this minor matter too deserves A moment's thought) what sacrilege 'twould seem To bolster out, disfigure and compress That realization of a sculptor's dream Of pure proportion—sinuous symmetry— So simply clad in classic drapery— That hit the happy and harmonious mean Between the ripe and rich voluptuousness Of lovely Aphrodite—soft and warm— And beauty bright with a severer charm, The light strong grace of active Artemis:— Ah! what a sin to cramp a shape like this Into some flaunting wire-and-whalebone screen Of beauty-blighting frippery that combines In dull extravagance discordant lines, Sharp angles, shooting arcs and cutting curves; Aping—wasp-waisted, ample-skirted some— Cathedral-lantern o'er its swelling dome; Some hourglass-shaped, knee-hobbled, mummy-screwed Into the—modest frankness of ‘the nude!’ Each form fantastic from true taste that swerves In hideous freaks of fashionable dress! No! whether for her mind's or body's weal He most was anxious—most was bound to feel— Whichever way he looked, it seemed too plain, He must this longing for his home restrain. Canto the Second. A sad Resolve. 1. Amohia's misery. 2, 3. Wartime and news of invasion. 4. Amo's plan to save Ranolf. 5. A letter from home. 6. Another flight. I. So with factitious fervour—zeal in vain Assumed to banish thought and deaden pain, Sad Ranolf seeks the boar-hunt's toil again; While native mongrels, bad or good, replace His first stanch sturdy comrade in the chase; But none he loved so—none that so loved him— As that good-tempered wriggling tiger—Nim! And many a day and sometimes nights he passed Amid the forests on the Mountains vast; While Amo, loving still and lonely grieved, By his affected interest undeceived In these pursuits; and with increased distress, Saw the sad struggle she so well could guess— The discontent of forced contentedness. Though he was kind—aye kinder than before, 'Twas not for kindness that she yearned alone, But love—glad glowing love like that of yore, Impetuous and impassioned as her own That kindness might be pity—nay, it must! What else could be more likely—natural—just! What else could one of such exalted sphere Her fancy lifted to a realm so clear And high above her, from his glorious place Feel towards a being of inferior race, Such as her love still made herself appear? “Did he not come, a wonder and a prize From some far Clime mysterious as the Skies— Stoop in his flight to steep me in excess Of too delightful fleeting happiness— My lowly life with strange wild joys to crown, As Hapae in the legend once came down, The white-winged Wanderer from blue haunts above— And on Tawhaki lavished all that love? Ah! what am I, or what my claim or right To keep all to myself a thing so bright?—” And then her anguish took another turn; With the old pride at moments would she burn: “Am I not something too! through all the land Where'er on great or small the Sun would shine What Maid could boast superior birth to mine? Could I help hearing how on every hand They said—not men, even women—far and wide For beauty none with Amohia vied; None in the dance such wavy grace displayed; Such fair designs for rich-wrought purfles made— Like her could tell a legend—turn a song?— Was it all flattery then—delusive—wrong? Is she—through her whole life so praised—so prized, Doomed to be now neglected and despised?”— In her distraction then how would she try To hate the cause of all this agony; Half curse him in her impotent distress— Aye—curse him with a passion that—would bless! The mere conception of harsh words of hate Such instant fond revulsion would create, The ire wrung out by woe, in utterance choked, Itself a gush of boundless love provoked— The rage ran off in tears of tenderness: “Too mad! too mad!—too horrible to curse One so beloved—so beautiful—O worse Than Rona cursing the full Moon for light! Is it his blame he shines at such a height? Ah, miserable me! who can but find Food for a curse in what I am too blind— No—not too blind! I cannot, ne'er could be So blind, that dear, dear glory, not to see! And seeing it and him—to think it strange If love like mine he only could bestow On beings like himself in fair exchange— Bright beings—ah—those Maids he talked of so— All golden light and sunset-tinted snow! In beauty, knowledge—all attractions fine Such as perchance I never could divine, Would they not dim these poor dark charms of mine As he does all our native youths outshine! But could they love like me? Ah, were they here To show which held the dearest one most dear! Would they were here! if deadly danger prest His life, he soon would learn who loved him best! Would they, like me (O would I might!) to save Him sinking, rush into the flooded wave And all the terrors of the torrent brave? Would they, like me, dash into thickest fight, Cling to his conquering foe about to smite, And take the blow—Ah me! with what delight, Aimed at that head so beautiful—so bright! Then, then—those Wonders—none he soon would see Could worship—doat on—die for him like me! Ah, why can men love nothing but the skin, So little care for all that glows within— All that should lure their love—their praises win? Ah why was I not made as wise—as fair— Why should those Gods or Atuas—whatsoe'er They be—have left me of these gifts so bare And grudged me all but misery and despair? And yet he said—for I remember well When of those wondrous beauties he would tell The greatest merit could be had or known Was for another's good to give your own; And those grand Creatures, born to light and bliss, Good in so much besides were best in this. But there at least I am their equal—I; O could I not the best of them defy To give all I would give his good to buy? None—none of them like me, without a sigh, To give him joy a thousand times would die: O that the chance would rise—howe'er it came That I might prove and he might learn the same!” And so the days slid heavily for both— Each grief grew daily with the other's growth; And from the woods upon his sad return The sadness in her eyes he would discern, And try to cheer her, O, with words too drear— Words meaning much—but sounding little—cheer. And then it was her turn sad joy to feign, Which, pressing hard her heart to check its pain She feigned—with stiffening lips that twitched in vain; Thinking—with anguish smiling for his sake— “O misery! my heart will break, will break!” II. So matters stood. And now the Autumn's fruits— Karaka—tarro—kumera—berries, roots— Had all been harvested with merry lays And rites of solemn gladness; choral praise And pure religious feeling—grateful—true; Though rude, benighted if you will, the due Of the great bounteous Spirit unknown or known Of Nature; due in every clime or zone; They called it ‘Rongo’—God of fruits and peace; What matter, so the gratitude was given To Spirit—call it Nature, God or Heaven?— The worst was, almost ere the songs could cease, With idiot inconsistency, like—men, The very life-preserving gifts that then They thanked their God for, they would straight employ As means, almost incentives, to destroy; And seize the occasion of abundant food As fittest for the work of war and blood. III. 'Twas then, that tidings of invasion planned By far more dangerous foes against their land, Reached Rotorua's people; how in brief That mighty tribe, of all the tribes the chief, Far in the North, whom not their neighbours dread Not even the great Waikato could withstand— Such wealth of guns and powder could they boast, (For with the white man's ships they trafficked most) Were coming, an innumerable host 'Twas rumoured, by the famous Chieftain led With whom the marriage treaty was begun Which Amo when she swam the Lake had fled; So much the picture of her beauty brought By Kangapo had on his fancy wrought; Such power had recently that rabid Priest— (By careless Ranolf in contempt released When after Tangi's death the warfare ceased)— O'er the excited haughty Chieftain won; And, mad with rancour and revengeful spite He could not wreak on Ranolf, nor requite That spurner of his supernatural might Who laughed at necromantic spells and charms, Except by tearing Amo from his arms— Had roused the Chief's too ready sense of slight, By representing Tangi in the light Of an abettor of his daughter's flight; And acquiescent in the wrong his pride Endured from those who sought—then set aside— The great alliance they would now deride. So all this storm was brewing, it was plain, And soon would ruin and destruction rain Upon their tribe, one special end to gain,— To force surrender of the proffered bride, And vengeance on the Stranger so obtain. IV. Before the tidings well were told, which filled The eager-listening crowd with blank dismay, The prescient heart of Amohia chilled; And through her brain there shot a gloomy ray. That Message seemed her secret Soul to seek; Seemed to her inner consciousness to speak Doomlike, before the story was got through; Almost before she heard the half, she knew Her hour was come, and all she had to do. To foes like these resistance would be vain, She would be captured, Ranolf would be slain. This was the chance that she had prayed for still; This was the moment when her heart should thrill With joy, not terror, for the hope it gave— Nay, all the certainty her heart could crave— To prove her love and her adored one save! Yes; she, ere it burst forth, that storm would stay, Anticipate—prevent that dreadful day And turn its terrors from one head away! To save that dear one, she would go alone And give herself to that resistless Chief; The wrong, if done by Ranolf, so atone And buy his life, O more than with her own!— Her life were little—better could she bear To give a thousand lives than seem to share Another's love; that was the pain, the smart, That was the sacrifice that wrung her heart; Yet, worse than death, to make his life secure This outrage to her love would she endure! Yet life would still be given—for O with grief She soon would die, and death would be relief! Or if it came not of itself—and here Pale grew her solemn brow and more severe Her eyes and firm prest lips—herself would rend The life away that misery would not end. But Ranolf would be saved—O he would know How matchless, boundless was her love—and woe; And feel, the best of those he vaunted so Could not outdare her in devotion—make Such sacrifice of self for his dear sake! Then would he long for her again—and weep Her loss, and ever in his bosom deep His poor wild maiden's memory fondly keep! But Ranolf, whose own cares too deeply weighed, Not much attention to these tidings paid: “It was their greed for marvels—nothing more; Or if that doughty Chieftain and his men Were bent upon invading them—what then? They would be thrashed as Whetu was before.” So he continued listless to explore The forests for the footprints of the boar. And Amo thought, “He does not know their power, Nor half their evil deeds in victory's hour”— And all the more determined it was right Herself should save him in his own despite. V. And often had she fixed the day to start, Yet could not bear from all life's light to part; The project oft deferred, was still renewed Whenever Ranolf's restlessness she viewed; Until one night arrived for her and him That filled their cup of misery to the brim. That day a precious letter from his home— With slanting oval postmarks blue and red, And scrawls “Try here—try there” all overspread— Had (passed from tribe to tribe) to Ranolf come; And with it, news that all the Chiefs who shared The great proposed invasion were prepared With countless guns and piles of packed-up food And war-canoes and crowds of warriors good To start in sanguinary, sanguine mood.— And Amo all that eve had sate and gazed With tearful looks, how fond! on Ranolf's face And eyes so seldom from the letter raised, Or fixed in sad abstraction far away, While on his knees the fatal missive lay; And fancied all his thoughts she well could trace— With maddening hopelessness how they would run Upon the Sister—Mother—long unseen; And what a roar of Ocean—vast—unknown— And obstacles far greater, stood between Those loved ones and the Brother and lost Son; And some sweet phantom Shape still dearer, she Would fancy in his picture there must be! 'Twas then, and there, with burning—bursting heart And choking throat—she bound herself, alone Come what come might—next morning to depart. VI. So, when day broke, while Ranolf, half the night Awake, was sleeping sadly by her side, She rose up—from her prostrate grief upright— To take a last long gaze—heart-broken bride— Upon that sleeping face—her life—her pride! Then, in an agony of tenderness With those fair golden curls she toyed awhile That seemed to mock her with their sunny smile; And lavished many a bitter-sweet caress Upon the brow and cheeks and fast-closed eyes She loved so—more than ever seemed to prize, And thought more beautiful in this distress; And hid at last her face upon his breast, And wept a passionate flood of bitter tears— “O could she there end all—joys, woes and fears— Dead—dead at once—for ever there to rest!”— And when at those fond touches Ranolf woke And saw her grief and words of comfort spoke Returning her caress, and sought to know What sudden sorrow caused these tears to flow; With quick-recovered firmness she replied— “'Twas nothing—he was not to mind her—she Was foolish—was ‘porangi’—and would be Better directly—” and her tears she dried And smiled in utter misery—and tried Her deep despairing eyes from his to hide; The while with more than usual busy zeal It seemed, she went about the morning meal; Then set it quietly before him—made Some light excuse why he could not persuade Herself to touch it—quietly received His last caress, as, bidding her be cheered, “For he would soon return, she might be sure!”— And kissing her, he stroked her tresses black, And with his dogs and gun, and heart sore-grieved Off to the hills, by her calm looks deceived, As usual went; while she, with bosom seared And brain that whirled confused upon a rack Of thoughts and feelings she could scarce endure, Till all that she was seeing, hearing—seemed Something she heard not—saw not—only dreamed, She stood there watching till he disappeared;— Then flung herself upon her couch, and there Gave full, wild vent to sobbings of despair. Soon with set teeth she rises; from her eyes Brushes the blinding tears that will arise; And snatching up a small supply of food— For life must last to make her purpose good— Still in the clutch of that wild passion held That from her tight grief-strangled bosom swelled Up to her throbbing brow,—as if compelled By outward force—she keeps her frenzied thought As well as her despairing fevered glance From resting on a single circumstance Of past or recent happiness, or aught About that dim—loved—lost—and torturing scene— The hut—the room where she so blest had been! But staggering as beneath a heavy load Rushes straight forward on her blighted road. Canto the Third. Death of the Magician. 1. Amo passes the scenes of her old happiness. 2. Her despair. 3. A contrast. 4. Kangapo attempts to stop her. 5. His death. 6. She pursues her journey. 7. Crossing a river is swept away. I. So all that day, as by a dream possessed— On—on—by one idea absorbed, opprest— For many a mile, as if herself she fled, Shunning all human sight the Wanderer sped: ‘To save him!’ the one hope, one lure to guide Her course—all goading sharp despair beside. But when exhausted nature would have rest, And, reckless where, she sank upon the ground, She was upon the very spot, she found, Where Ranolf and herself by rain delayed On that first blessed journey once had stayed. And at a little distance she espied The cave itself where they had made their nest,— Laughing, their happy nest!—a yellow cave Of clayey sandstone scooped out smooth and round By some long-vanished immemorial wave; One of a row that undermined the base Of the steep hill-side green with tangled fern— Only a few feet high and deep—a place Just large enough for those two lovers fond, And over-draped with drooping bough and frond. There lay the flattened fern-couch—brown and dry; The impress of two forms she could descry, Still undisturbed by winds or passers-by. Then did the conquering tenderness return; And she resolved (for, but a little space, The circuit her arrival would delay At her sad journey's end) she would repair Once more to those dear Lakes; the district fair Where all the bliss of her life's little day Lay like a vanished treasure; stored up there— Quite lost to her—gone—lost and laid away! II. Dim skies and heavy rain!— And by Mahana's Lake she roams again; Nursing her agony with insensate care, And pampering her despair: Has sought out every scene Where she and Ranolf had together been: On every sight Of wonder once and such delight Again has dwelt: And in their presence felt— Delight? Ah no! increased distress— No wonder—worse than weariness. The clouds were dark and low; Rain falling, soft and slow; Day closing on her woe; As, little heeding where she went, With trouble more than travel spent, She wandered reckless near the weird ravine That leads up to the Lake of waters green, Through spectral shapes forlorn Of rocks all torn and weather-worn; More gaunt, distorted, grim, Thus shadowy seen through vapours dim. Then at the entrance of that dismal vale, Where dense broom-thickets smothering screen Mud-pools that boil on every side, And pit the crust, that anywhere might fail The footstep, with foul cauldrons deep and wide;— There, she—with hands upon her knees that hid Her face, unmoving sat. And though the rain had soaked her flaxen mat, And slowly down the silken tresses slid, That fell neglected on the ground; Though in the silence as they slipped, The unkindly drops of dew Audibly dripped and dripped— She felt it not, nor knew. The only sight or sound She saw or heard around, Was that lost voice, that vanished face That once had glorified the place; And now, in such a torturing maze Of tender recollections, wound Her burning brain, her breaking heart; The past to life appeared to start In vivid hues too beautiful to bear! Her vanished Bliss seemed over her to glare— A deadly-terrible Angel lovely-bright With outspread wings ablaze Above her hung;—till blasted by its light Down—down—she cowered—she sank—in misery's blackest night. III. How the gleam iridescent and shapeless—that lies Like the Wreck of a Rainbow flung crushed on the skies With its hues dimly blurred—where low down there flies The last rack of the tempest; to mariners drear How forlornly it calls up the memory clear Of the Arch all resplendent! the luminous Bow In the glory of orange and purple aglow, On the thick of the violet shadow behind In rounded perfection so sharply defined! When so airily tender—transparently mild, Yet so firmly enthroned o'er the elements wild; So softly aspiring and gracefully grand, On the air, like a rock, it has taken its stand, And lords it serenely o'er ocean and land!— Even so—as she lay overwhelmed by despair Wan, weary and haggard—crushed, cowering there, Even so—and so sadly! her woe-begone mien Might have roused the remembrance of what she had been When the Maid in the maddening days that had flown In the bloom and the pride of her happiness shone! IV. A hand upon her shoulder laid, With sudden startling pressure stayed Her anguish in its mid career; Though not the slightest sound betrayed A human being's presence near. 'Twas Kangapo! who silent crept Upon her, thinking that she slept; Till as he neared the weeping maid, Her heart-wrung moans the truth conveyed. To aid the Northern Chief's designs, and make The conquest sure which his revenge would slake; To spy into the schemes the people planned To meet the invaders of their threatened land; But most with well-feigned tale and crafty lie To lull them into false security; The wily Priest had ventured back once more— Safe in the sorcerer's dread repute he bore— To prowl about the country, gather news, And disaffection, where he could, diffuse; Hiding the while, and less from need than taste, In many a well-known haunt of wood and waste. When Amo raised in wild surprise Her tear-bedabbled face and eyes, And saw whose form above her hung; Whose spiteful, cool, triumphant leer Into her grief would pry and peer, Indignant to her feet she sprung: “You, Kangapo! and wherefore here? “Nay, rather—” was the answering sneer, “Say what has brought to such disgrace, Such evil plight, so lone a place, The Stranger's Love—the white man's bride! Has he, whose pale and girlish face Could win, despite her birth and race, Her tribe's renown—her father's pride, The Maori maiden to his side— Has he turned false, or fled—or died?” “Ask nought of him; no mate of thine; Thy course pursue—leave me to mine!” “Nay—listen, Amo! let me tell—” “Away! I know thy wiles too well!” V. No longer now his darkening brow And coldly-glittering eye instilled The terror that whene'er he willed Had once the Maiden's bosom chilled. The might of one supreme despair Would let no lesser passion share That bosom; one absorbing care Had left no room for terror there. She sought not to upbraid, reply; Too sad for scorn, she turned to fly. He saw his words their purpose missed, Yet would not from his aim desist: “Not listen! so resolved to go!— Think not you shall escape me so;— Think not I've no assistance nigh!—” With sudden grasp he seized her wrist And shouted. Then once more her eye Shot forth its proud indignant light; Her form expanded to full height; She looked almost as when she stood A captive bound beside the wood When first she dazzled Ranolf's sight;— Yet now so haggard, wan and worn, By grief of so much beauty shorn, Not much more like that Vision bright Of anger-flashing loveliness, Than some too early perished Tree, A silver skeleton portrayed Against the mountain's violet shade, Like its own former self would be, In luxury clad of leafy dress; In sunlit symmetry of frame And every sinuous branch the same; But all the wealth wherewith it shone Of blossom gay and verdure—gone!— The wrist he held—she wrenched it free, And flung him off with all her might. He reeled—he stumbled—staggered back; Nor had he seen how near he stood To that fierce cauldron, sputtering black And baleful—ever-boiling mud— Beneath the phantom-shapes of rock That seemed to gibber, jeer and mock! The treacherous bank began to crack— Gave way—and with a sullen plash He plumped into the viscous mash. The sable filth upspurted high— Foul steam in thicker volumes gushed; Then back the burning batter rushed And closed o'er that despairing face Upturned in blue-lined agony— Those writhing limbs—that stifled cry! Then heavily swelled into a cone; Sunk down; and ring on ring a space In sluggish undulations rolled; And thicklier rising crowds alone Of bubbles, of that horror told; Though just as lazily they burst, And not more poisonous than at first Their old sulphureous stench dispersed. Shocked, horrified, at sight so dread Swift through the thicket Amo sped: So rapidly had all occurred, Well might what she had seen and heard— That Sorcerer's apparition—then And there—in that secluded glen, And his swift disappearance, seem Illusions of a hideous dream. VI. Again her journey she pursues. Her thoughts come back to their accustomed train: “Only to save him—only make him know, Although her joy—her life—her love she lose— No other Maid could love him so!”— Still fell the sad, slow, melancholy rain; And though the white mist hid sky, mountain, plain, Yet somehow seemed it, on her weary brain The sunshine of that awful morn When Ranolf last she saw and left— Still lay—a solemn sombre light forlorn;— Ever she seemed to wander woebegone Through endless mazes of a forest lone All stripped and bare, of every leaf bereft; While far above her, through the treetops high That, leafless, yet shut out the sky, A loud monotonous wind for ever roared, And those strange, dreary, sombre sunbeams poured; While in the foreground only could be seen The lover and the love-joy that had been! And every actual outward sight and sound, Men, women, places, voices all around, Came faintly breaking through this muffling screen, This sad bright curtain that would intervene; And only for a moment, face or speech Importunate of others, could emerge Through that drear desolate light and murmur loud As through an ever-circling shroud— And her preoccupied perception reach And on her absent mind their presence urge. VII. On—on! for days as by a dream oppressed— Still on—by one idea absorbed—possessed!— Directly in her way A broad and swollen river lay: Her road led through the shallows by its bank, Where yellow waters eddying swirled Through flax-tufts waving green and tall and rank; But in the midst the raging torrent hurled Its waters swift, direct, and deep, Where often some uprooted tree would sweep— A great black trunk unwieldy—hastening down The flood surcharged with clayey silt— And dip and heave and plunge and tilt Half buried in the wavelets brown. She paused—but something in her breast Still urged her on:—she could not rest: And then those friends whom Kangapo addrest— Might they not still her course arrest? What if they still should be upon her track— Would they not meet her if she ventured back?— She tore her mantle off in haste, And rolled it up and tightly tied With flax and slung it round her waist; Then wading, struggled through the high sword-grass And stream-bowed tortured blades—a tangled mass, And struck into the torrent fierce and wide! Alas! no strength of limb or will, No stoutest heart, no swimmer's skill Could long withstand the headlong weight and force Of that wild tide in its tumultuous course!— Soon was she swept away—whirled o'er and o'er— And hurried out of conscious life In that o'erwhelming turbulence and roar Almost without a sense of pain or strife. Canto the Fourth. Where is Comfort? 1, 2. Amo's body on the river-bank. 3. What comfort in reflections the thought of it suggests? All great souls self-sacrificed in the cause of Good, a protest against Annihilation. 4. Fate's cruelty forces belief in a future state. If Doubt needful to create Trust and Soul-excellence? 5. No theories good against Grief. 6. Yet Ranolf's buoyant nature will survive to learn how sorrow elevates, and (7) is the nurse of heroism. I. So was despair, in our heart-broken Bride, Quenched, rudely quenched—in that tumultuous tide!— But if that self-forgetting Life was passed, To peace, it seemed, it had been lulled at last. For one who by the river's side Far lower down, that day by chance descried A floating form he could not aid, Glide swiftly by, soon after said The Maiden lay, as past she hied, Upon her back as on a quiet bed. Her eyes were closed—the lashes long and sleek, Reposing on the placid cheek; Along the yellow waters wild Her jet-black tresses softly streamed; And though careworn, just then it seemed, Her face was so serene and mild, So mournful, yet with meek content so deep,— She looked an innocent Child, Laid on its couch asleep. And that informant told them how they found, Cast on the gravel by the riverside, The body of the Maiden drowned. II. Alas, for Ranolf! in his passionate pain That image ever was before his brain In terrible distinctness night and day! With pertinacious torture self-applied How would he conjure up to his despair, And paint with accurate anguish-seeking care Its harrowing details o'er and o'er again! How, while the river ran its calm career, From the spent freshet's fury once more clear; All heartless Nature, bright, alive and gay With its accustomed, gentle, joyous stir— How then they found—O say not her! She could not be the form that lay So stilly—half above and half beneath The shallow, bright, transparent stream, Upon the clean smooth gravel bank From which it slowly shrank: Such mournful meek content upon the face That you could think it for a little space Lit by some sadly-pleasing dream; But then so marble-like and motionless— Persistent in intensest quietness— Too soon the moulded lineaments you know Fixed in the dread serenity of death. One quiet arm the peaceful head below— While ever in its flow The eddying current would come up and play With the long tresses—as to coax away And lure the floating tangles to and fro; While others, in the sunshine dried, The idle breeze at times would lift aside Gently—then leave at rest, Where curling they caressed The cold unheaving breast; Or revelled in the gloss and gleam of life, As if in mockery spread Along the form that lay as still and dead As any of the logs of driftwood rife, By the decreasing tide Left near it as it fled.— But piteous—O how piteous! there to see The wavelets in their sunny chase In that deserted place— Upon the bank exposed and lone, With such an inward-happy sound, Familiarly and carelessly Gurgling against and rippling round The sad and sacred human face, As if it were a stone. III. And had he any comfort in the thought, The sight his fancy fashioned would have brought A mind like his when he could calmly think?— “That sad—sad face! as there it lay Beside the river's brink, So calm, neglected—helpless—meek— Would not its silence seem to speak— In mournful whispers seem to say, For such a heart, for such a soul, This cannot be the end—the whole!— “But O! great God of heaven! Who must be—if thou be at all Eternal Justice both to great and small, And Absolute Love for all beneath the Sun! If in the poor dead face of one Slight savage girl who thus has given Her life's light for another's good in vain— All her high hopes and generous aims undone! If in its stony stillness and fixed woe, All the more harrowing for the mournful show Of sad resigned repose on mouth and brow— If from that face, in very deed, Such obstacle and protest and disdain Arise against the desolating creed Of soul-annihilation in the disarray And dissolution of our worthless clay— O what a vast Himmálayan pinnacle-chain Of insurmountable obstruction Thou Hast thrown in the pale spectral Conqueror's way; And what a boundless protest has been wrung— (Although to absolute Love's all-pitying eyes The humblest instance would the whole comprise) A protest myriad-voiced as Ocean's roar, Compelled to just Omnipotence to soar,— In all the baffled lives and labours flung Ungrudgingly thy great White Throne before— The death-requited sacrifices through all time Made in thy cause by hero-hearts sublime! IV. “Yet what a thought it is, O God! that we But by the incredible cruelty of Fate Ordained by Thee, Are by a strong revulsion forced to flee To Reason's refuge in her grief, The astounding beautiful belief In Death reviving to some glorious state Which all that cruelty shall compensate!— Say, that it is so, and must ever be, By Nature's strong necessity;— As air plunged deep in water still must rise, So, plunged in Life, the Soul to the Eternal flies!— And if it be denied That Nature—which is Thou! Does that necessity provide, Even Doubt must still avow It should be so provided—must and should— If Thou art what we must conceive Thee—good! Or if at last Doubt will remain, Were it too wild a fancy—to maintain, (Till clearer light the mystery explain) Faith has to be created—self-resigning Trust In Thee—the all-generous and just? And Trust like that, for aught we know, Can but in the absence of Assurance grow; Can but be strengthened to the due degree By actual plunging in the furnace-glow And wavering flames of forced Uncertainty: The Soul can but be fashioned so, Into the shape of Beauty, and substance clear Of crystal Confidence sincere— The form and fineness its high fates require; As the glass-worker whirls and moulds Into a graceful vase the glass he holds Molten in jets intense of fierce white fire.” V. Ah no! but no such speculation now Could smooth the agony on Ranolf's brow. And so he may depart, And bind up as he can his bleeding heart; And moan his lovely wild-flower reft away With unresigning anguish night and day; And gnash his teeth and tear his hair, Untaught to bear! And for a time his faith in joy forswear; And feel how vain Are high-built theories to stifle pain; How impotent against the ready sting Of every trivial and inanimate thing That seems to start up eloquent everywhere, More poignant memories of the Lost to bring— All leagued with Love to drive him to despair! Not only the brief words she left to tell The motive and the purpose of her flight, Scratched upon shining flax-blades with a shell And laid to meet—but not too soon—his sight;— Ah! how it tore his heart—that simple scrawl— Pothooks and hangers painfully produced— Disjointed—childlike! yet a wonder all, In one to symbolled language so unused, And with such marvellous aptitude acquired— The tenfold talent by the heart inspired— Docility no school but one e'er knew Whose teacher Love, has Love for learner too! Not these alone—but every object round Had silent power and pungency to wound: The withered wreaths of flowers hung up with care Which for his pleasure she so loved to wear; The span-broad mirror on the reeded wall That oft had imaged such a happy smile And so much beauty on its surface small; The broidry-staves her tedium to beguile— Rude with still-dangling vary-coloured strands;— Half-charred mid ashes white, the very brands Left lying where her loving busy hands Had laid them on that latest fire extinct— Ah, with what torturing memories were they linked! Ah, those dumb things—how deeply did he feel The maddening pathos of their mute appeal! Yes! let him wrestle with distress; And feel how grief grown languid, though not less, In the exhaustion of mere weariness, Renews itself from its excess;— Learn how the heart bereft of one beloved, Will, self-upbraiding, self-reproved, In bitterest grief feel bitter grief, Because its grief seems all too slight and brief; Because it cannot grieve enough—nor feed The ravenous appetite for woe the sense Of its immeasurable loss will breed— Thirsting for grief more crushing—more intense; Recoiling from the hateful thought, that e'er The time should come when it may bear To think upon such loss, and not despair! VI. Yet should he long endure Such pangs and pains, be sure He must escape them—being left alive; For the old joyous temper must revive. The clouds of Anguish o'er the blue would drive And hide—but not annihilate the Sun: Grief has a work to do—which must be done. Though o'er his Soul the waves of Sorrow surge, That buoyant joyous Nature must emerge By animal force into a realm more bright; And that reflective tendency would urge His Soul—long after—into peaceful light. And he would first experience—and then know, How great a purger of the Soul is Woe; A fine manipulator skilled to drain The Spirit of the grosser atmosphere Which can alone give life to and sustain Prides—lusts—ambitions—passions fierce and vain; Until the heart is a receiver clear Exhausted of the elements they need, And wanting which, they droop and disappear. VII. Aye! to our Optimist 'twould surely seem An actual pre-arrangement in a scheme By primal Mind compacted—that the seed Of Soul best in the soil of Sorrow grows; And that such pangs and tortures are indeed Sharp chisel-strokes and heavy mallet-blows Wherewith the grand Soul-Sculptor cleaves and chips His native marble into nobler shapes: And as the mallet swings and chisel trips,— Out from the sluggish cold chaotic heap Wherein as possibilities they sleep, Out come, emerging from their long eclipse Into vitality that kindling glows Ever more clear, significant and deep— Heroic white Existences serene And lovely, which the divine Artist drapes With qualities his great Idea must mean Should make his glorious marbles fit to be Shrined in high temples of Eternity! And he would learn, like all who calmly viewed What sad results from simple love ensued, How foresight—prudence—cold considerate powers We need for guidance of this life of ours: To follow instincts—doing ill to none— Nay—loving everything beneath the sun— This will not do—it seems! Alas!—for such the World with misery teems. But this—all this would be for Time to teach; A goal his sanguine soul not yet may reach. All he has now to do is to depart And bind up as he may his bleeding heart. Canto the Fifth. A Vision. 1. Ranolf leaves for the sea-side. 2. Comes to a native village. 3. Remorse at his former fear of ‘the World.’ 4. Noon-stillness. 5. The vision. 6. His amazement. I. Depart then, Ranolf! leave to Grief and Time The task to cleave out, in some other clime Less fraught with frenzied thoughts, their ends sublime! Even Sorrow could not here its fruits mature— Not here—nor now; for Change and Time, be sure, Are needed to assist it in its Art Of Soul-Tuition. This by theory too, Though spurning now the power of both, he knew; And felt his only course was to depart. The land seemed loathsome to his laden heart; Sick—sick he was; aweary of the skies! The Mountains seemed to look him in the face— Cold—calm and sullen, conscious of his woe; Each shrub and tree that once had charmed him so, Turned wormwood with the thoughts it bade him trace: And every River rolled before his eyes, A Mara-flood of bitterest memories. When the first shock of Amo's death was o'er, And he could rouse himself to act once more, With but one lad his light effects to bear, He started for some Northwest harbour where Vessels that haunt these latitudes repair. A Ship he sought; but cared not whence it came Or whither bound: to him it was the same So that away, far distant, he were borne: All lands seemed now of all attractions shorn! Perhaps, as most deserted and forlorn, The barren, dreary, ever-restless Sea, Would to his desolate Soul most soothing be. His road was nearly that which Amo chose, In search self-ruinous of ruthless foes. Not that he sought with conscious aim the more To take that path because 'twas hers before: His unresigning anguish could not crave To see, or seek for solace at her grave; Herself—herself! the vain demand—nought less— His greedy grief insatiable would press; Not any maddening circumstance or scene To rouse remembrances of what had been— Too prompt already, manifold and keen! Yet haply he was guided on the whole, By that attraction of his secret soul; A bias, though unconsciously obeyed, Towards even the shadow of that loved one's shade— Towards any place her sweetest presence still With haunting fondness sadly seemed to fill. When near the coast, they told him of a Ship Whose Master would ere long his anchor trip For three years' chase of his gigantic game, Run down o'er boundless Ocean hunting-grounds With hardy boats'-crews for his well-trained hounds— In that most venturous, gravest, grandest Sport Which makes all others seem contracted—tame! His Ship was now with ample produce stored, Wood—water—fresh provisions all on board; And he was just about to leave the Port, Cutting his boisterous crew's rude revels short. II. Sad, weary, listless, and alone— For nought companionship had cheered— 'Twas Ranolf's habit through the day To take his solitary way, Letting Te Manu choose his own. Before him now the Port appeared. There—with dim spire of masts and shrouds, And yards across like streaky clouds,— The Ship he sought at anchor lay. Crowning a cliff that overstooped The sea—whence trees o'erhanging drooped, The village stood the Wanderer neared. With rows of posts, unequal, high, That level crest against the sky Was bristling; and within them grouped, Thick thatch-roofs nestled peacefully. Woeworn and weary, then he went Thoughtfully up the steep ascent; And passed the log, rough-hewn and laid For bridge across the empty fosse; And paused before the opening made For entrance in the palisade. He looked around; upon the spot He saw no living being stirred: Fast-closed was every silent cot. The sun was shining, high and hot— A lingering summer afternoon; Faint insects hummed a drowsy tune At times—no other sound was heard. III. In doubt what course he should pursue, On sad and gloomy thoughts intent, With folded arms and head downbent Against an entrance post he leant. Not far below, there hung in view That immemorial red-blue gleam Of world-embracing Ocean-fame— The flag that long shall float supreme (Its double-cross still side by side With that of ‘Stars and Stripes’ allied) Let all of English blood and name Be to each other staunch and true! Ah, with what sense of proud delight, So long unseen, a short time back That flag had flashed upon his sight! But now it bade his memory track The train of evils that had come Out of that longing for his home. Well might his heart so busied, feed On bitter anguish; well might bleed Remembering why he shunned to share That home with her! He could not bear Nor blink the truth, the cause, to-day— Contemptible and coward care Of what ‘the World’ might think or say— That blatant—brainless—soulless World! Ah with what scorn he would have hurled Such pitiful respect away Had one more chance been given to prove How much he prized that priceless love! O but one chance—giv'n then and there The ‘World’ and all its slaves to dare! With measureless defiance brave Its worthless worst rebukes and save A heart, so simply grand beside Its poor conventions, paltry pride, Refined frivolities—and cant, The natural course—or worse—the want Of real emotions, framed to hide!— Aye! but too late that wisdom came; The shame too late of that mean shame; Remorse and withering self-disdain, Too late and impotent and vain! There was nought left him but to rave With voiceless, useless, inward pain. His trust in higher things was gone— His ‘Power Divine’—his ‘God of good,’ What faith in Him could he retain! It seemed to his despairing mood, Faith could not, should not, live alone When Hope and happiness had flown! IV. On such distressful thoughts intent, Against that entrance-post he leant. Forlorn alike to eye and ear Seemed time and place and atmosphere! With wearying, bright unchanging glow The calm, regardless sunbeams shone; With wearying faintly-changeful flow The insects' tune went murmuring on. No sign of living thing beside; Not even a dog's out-wearied howl;— Yes—once his listless eye espied Scarce noting it, a sleepy fowl Ruffling its feathers in the dust; Companionless—the moping bird, Stalking and pecking leisurely Beneath a cottage wall, went by; No longer were its mutterings heard. Yes—once a rat, in open day Stole forth, and crossed at easy pace The silent solitary place; Stopped often, showing no distrust Nor any haste to slink away. It too had vanished. Still fast-shut, In sunshine stood each silent hut: And dark, distinct, beside it lay Its shadow still—no cloudlet slow Passing to make it come or go— Unfading—seeming changeless too As if it neither moved nor grew, That lingering, loitering afternoon. Then even the murmuring, dreamy tune, That now would swell and now subside, Awhile in utter silence died. V. Fair Reader! have you ever been Sauntering in meditative mood, In some sequestered sunny scene, Some perfect solitude serene, Where tenantless a building stood— Old ruined Castle, if you will— Neglected Hall of later days, Though fit for habitation still, Long empty;—any place almost Where human beings once have dwelt And ceased to dwell;—but if your gaze, On such deserted Mansion lone Were fixed awhile, will you not own How strong a fancy you have felt That some still human visage—ghost Or not—through one blank window less Observed—or loophole's high recess— With eyes in vague abstraction lost, Not marking minding you at all— Was looking out?—Did you not feel As if you saw or soon would see A lonely Figure, silently, With features haply undiscerned Because its back towards you was turned, Across some empty courtyard steal— Or glide beneath some ruined wall?— As Ranolf leant there so distrest, Once with a writhe of ill-represt Impatient anguish at the tide Of keen regrets which o'er his breast— Remorseful, merciless, upheld By that full moon of memory, swelled— As wearily his head he raised, His glance unconscious chanced to rest Upon a distant cot—whose side Of close-packed wisps of bulrush dried, Stood half in brightness—half in gloom; The sunbeam's glow still bright below— Its upper part in clear deep shade Beneath some palm-trees' tufts of bloom, With a square opening in it made For light—a window though unglazed. Then suddenly he seemed aware A wan pale face—how wan and fair, Was in the square of blackness there; With eyes unmoving—eyes all light— So preternaturally bright— Haggardly beautiful!—Amazed, His very heart turned sick and faint; Almost he could have fallen with fear— That Spirit from the Dead—so near!— He rallied quickly; for he knew How fancy can send back again, Some image from the heated brain, And on the retina repaint Such apparitions, till they seem External, actual, and no dream. He passed his hand across his eyes; Sprang forward; shook himself to free His fancy from such phantasies, His brain from this delusion. There, Framed in the blackness of that square, Still showed the visage, haggard, fair, And would not vanish into air!— And then it changed before his sight; A sudden gleam of wild delight Illumed it; the next moment checked, As from the vision seemed to come A shriek that died off in a moan— Painful, unnatural—as the tone Wrung from the wretched deaf and dumb Whom sudden pangs of passion stir. Then to the hut—for nought he recked— “What could it be?” he thought, “but her!” He would have rushed; but yet once more Those earnest gestures—looks—deter; So vehemently they implore, So unmistakably entreat Silence—and that he should not greet— Heed—recognize the vision then. For the same moment might be seen Behind him, close upon the fence, What stifled as it rose that keen Great cry of joy or pain intense;— The inmates of the village—men And women and a merry crowd Of children; all with laughter loud Returning from the plot where they Within the woods not far away Had been at pleasant work all day. VI. With lips comprest—clenched hand—knit brow— By violent effort he restrained Emotions nigh o'ermastering now. He turned—accosted them—explained In terms he scarce knew what, but brief, To one who seemed to be their Chief Why he had come to that seaport. At once they knew their guest unknown Must be, from bearing, mien and tone, Though roughly drest and travel-stained, A ‘Rangatira’—of the sort Who paid for all attentions shown: So to his use a cot assigned; Brought food; and as he seemed inclined For little converse, or to care About themselves or ways; or share The interest newer comers take In all that might the curious wake To wonder; but appeared to be Absorbed in troubles of his own; They soon with truest courtesy Left him to his reflections lone. And all that evening, in a maze He seemed:—a sort of luminous haze Of anxious, wondering, strange delight Moved with him, move where'er he might: Nor could he lie, or sit, or stand, Or many moments keep at rest, Howe'er he strove at self-command. He closed his eyes—his temples pressed;— That light, for all his efforts vain Still hovered o'er his haunted brain: And once, in this his feverish fret, He checked himself in looking round As half expectant he would yet See, though long since the sun had set, His shadow fall upon the ground. And oft he tried if he could still By strong exertion of the will Make that fair, haggard vision rise Again, and stand before his eyes With such a sharp external show Of life, and every feature so Distinct in joy, surprise, or woe! That face, so sweet, though so careworn, And of its brilliant beauty shorn; The hollow cheek; the shrunken hand; And the too delicate finger laid Upon the faded lips; and grand All wonder, joy, or woe above— That deep unfathomable love In eyes whose brightness could not fade! Yes! he could shape them in his mind; But overjoyed was he to find No yearning made the illusion dear As real or outward reappear. Canto the Sixth. The Departure. 1. Midnight. 2. A visitor. 3. Plan for escape. 4. Previous story. 5. Ranolf embarks. 6. A starry night. 7. The boat on the shore. 8. Final meeting. 9. Recovery. 10. Departure. I. Night came at last; at last ev'n midnight came. How wearily the hours for Ranolf passed— On tenterhooks of expectation cast— Such incomplete and tantalizing joy! But even the noisy natives sunk at last To rest—the earlier for their day's employ. The flittings to and fro, from hut to hut, Ceased by degrees, and every door was shut; The laughter loud and lazy chat were o'er; The smouldering firesticks on each earthen floor Had for the last time been together raked, And blown with lips far-pouted, to a flame; The last pipe smoked; and the consuming thirst For gossip haply for the moment slaked. The large-limbed lounging men upon the ground, Naked whene'er the heat too great was found; And every active, restless, wrinkled dame,— Crowded in some convenient house at first, Had to their separate homes retired to sleep; And all the ‘pah’ was wrapt in silence deep. II. Then Ranolf, with a quicker-throbbing heart, Watched in the cot assigned to him apart; With door ajar, and sharp attentive ear Watched—listened for the faint delicious sound— The footstep that he felt must now be near. —A rustle . . . No?—'twas fancy!—then more clear Another!—'Tis herself! with that wan face, Locked in his almost fiercely fond embrace!— Yes, 'tis herself! and never, come what may, Shall she be torn from that fond heart away! And She—into his arms herself she flung With what a burst of passionate sobs! and hung Upon his neck with moans of happiness; And felt once more his vehement caress, With what an ecstacy of soothing tears! And revelled in the burning kiss on kiss, With such intense relief from doubts and fears; Such sense of infinite agony supprest, Swallowed, like night in lightning-sheets—in this, This full fruition of exceeding bliss— As if upon the heaven of that breast Her soul had reached its everlasting rest! But when the Sea of their emotions ran In less tumultuous billows, and began In gentler agitation to subside, So that clear Thought and Speech articulate Above the tide unwrecked could ride; Then Ranolf, holding at arms' length awhile His new-found treasure, his recovered bride, Gazes with mournful gladness in his smile— Gazes with fond and pitying tenderness At those thin pallid features, which the weight And anguish of despair no more depress— Into those eyes which happy tears beteem— As to make sure it was not all a dream! “No Spirit then!—my own Own Amo, loving and alive again! O God! can such delight indeed be mine!”— “No Spirit—no—nor dead, but with the pain To lose thy love; and thought of that alone Would kill me any time—” “Then never think The thought; the thing itself, my dearest, best, Shall never be a grief of thine!” “What! you will never be distrest For want of all that sunset-tinted snow And hair, such as the moonbeams link. . . What was it?” “Amo!—” “Nay, then nay— Not that upbraiding look to-day! See! o'er these dear, dear features, worn with care, See, see! my murmuring lips must stray With flying faint half-kisses, so To smooth all that reproach away! No, I will never doubt again— Do not these features, pale with grief, Do they not say my Stranger-Chief My lord, my life, will never choose His poor wild maiden's love to lose?— But how then could you be so sad When I was with you?” “I was mad— An idiot, dearest! just to shun A small misfortune, so to run The risk of that o'erwhelming one By which I were indeed undone!— But small and great shall soon be o'er, And neither shall afflict us more, If you will leave this land with me, And dare to cross yon starlit sea!” “What is to me land, sea, or sky So that with you, I live and die!”— III. Then soon a plan for their escape Was moulded into practicable shape: Only the pressing, first, immediate need Was that before these natives they should be Absolute strangers, nor each other heed. This need did Amo when she first caught sight Of Ranolf, feel—this, somehow could foresee; And this perception made her first wild cry, That sudden cry of wonder and delight Die off in such a strange unmeaning moan. IV. But she had told ere this, the how and why She had been saved, and now was here alone; How it was true, by that wild freshet's force She was whirled down till consciousness was gone; And soon upon a gravel-bank was thrown. How a chance Traveller saw the seeming corse; Apprised these natives; and observed them bear The breathless body home with sorrowing care, Home to their huts hard-by; then went his way, Thinking her dead; that nought required his stay; And anxious by no loss of time to lose The importance, well he knew, none would refuse To the first bearer of such startling news. But those good Women, in the senseless Form They carried, saw or felt there yet might lurk Some faintest spark of life; so set to work Its embers to re-waken and re-warm; Made fires; applied hot stones, and rubbed her feet And hands and heart with toil incessant; poured Down her unconscious throat for greater heat Some of the white man's liquid fire; implored With moaned and murmured incantations meet The Water-God and Storm-God; till at length Her feeble fluttering pulse began to beat; And that suspended current in her veins To run, and rack her, as it gathered strength, And prick with tingling tortures, pangs and pains, Far worse than any she in drowning felt. So with their patient patiently they dealt, And charmed and chafed her till to life restored. But with her life her first resolve returned; And in her recklessness she let them know The scheme which to accomplish still she burned, To yield herself, ere he could strike a blow, To save her people, to her people's foe. How she repented soon that she had told Her secret: for the Chief, of no great name Or note, and doubtless of as little worth, Who ruled this petty village, stood, With that marauding magnate of the North,— Though some remote connection he could claim, So she was told, by marriage or by blood— On terms of doubtful amity; and hence The crafty schemer was too glad to seize A lucky accident like this to please The mightier potentate; so forthwith hatched A plan—to feign he could not trust her tale; And hold her captive, on the false pretence He did so to secure her without fail For the great Chief, until the last could say What was his will about her: then despatched A trusty messenger that will to learn; And issued strict commands, till his return Her every movement should be closely watched, Nor she permitted from the ‘pah’ to stray. And thus the great man's favour would be won; Besides that, for such shining service done, A splendid claim, he reckoned, would arise For ‘utu’—compensation or reward, The other could not fail to recognize. But she, determined not to be debarred From fully working out her first intent, To put both Chief and people off their guard, Affected in this plan to acquiesce; Resolved whene'er their watchfulness grew less, As finding 'twas but trouble vainly spent, She would escape; her lonely road resume; Self-guided seek her self-inflicted doom; The merit of her sacrifice retain, And greater power o'er proud Pomarë gain. So at the village patiently she stayed; Till all their first suspicions were allayed; About her ways it seemed they little cared; And she had everything for flight prepared: Nay, would that very night, unseen, unknown, Upon her errand of despair have flown; Rushed on the fate she loathed, yet would have braved Had she not been, by gift of all she craved, This blest return of his affection, saved. V So, parting ere the dawn, with life renewed, The plan concerted, calmly they pursued. Two days they passed, eventless and serene, Each by the other seemingly unseen; Or in what intercourse they chanced to hold Making a mock indifference, forced and cold, Their fervid interest in each other screen. In sad regards dissembling deep delight, Impassioned, with how passionless a mien, They crossed each other's path! with loving slight, Hidden half-glances of such dear deceit— Unrecognizing recognition sly and sweet! Then Ranolf to his hosts kind farewell bade; Much to their grief—so handsomely he paid; Nor seemed to notice Amo was not there Just at the instant that farewell to share: Then went on board; and found the busy Ship With cheery noise of near departure gay; Sails shaken loose and anchor now atrip, Waiting the evening hour of ebbing tide; Worked by the steadiest of the men—a few Exceptions to the riot-wearied crew— Who jaded with rude revel listless lay, Nor longer to evade their duty tried, Content at last or glad to get away. Then down the harbour she was seen to glide, Past the bare windy outer heads sunbright, The glossy yellowish bluffs—into the blue; There on the dim expanse, she lingering lay With slowly changing attitudes, in sight, As if her stately beauty to display; Then, dwindling ever in the fading light, Looked, now a column sloping softly white, Now ruddy, blushing in the sunset's ray; Till silently absorbed in growing grey She vanished—wrapt in close-encircling Night. VI. These moving moveless Mountains and still Main, Had nearly in their unfelt flight again Slipped from beneath the funnel of deep shade For ever shot from our Sun-circling ball, Through which we peer into Infinity;— Those four grand worlds tremendous which we call A Cross—and their immensity invade With faiths and fancies of our tiny Star, Seemed to have turned them in their watch on high, And changed the side from which to gaze afar On the dark Pole—the seeming vacant Throne Of One that Warder bright adored alone! As in blue Syrian midnights long bygone, Some jewel-armoured Satrap Damascene, More from the fevered restlessness inspired By Love, than with his tedious vigil tired, Might oft have changed the spot where he would lean And keep his fierce enamoured glances, keen And glittering as his falchion, rapt and fast Upon the lattice-screen whereat at last His maddening matchless quest—some miracle-Queen, In loveliness and learnedness and loftiness Of spirit, perfect as that Palmyrene,— But one ecstatic moment might appear, Zenobia-like—too dazzlingly severe,— And frown a sunrise on the love's excess Its glory could reward but not repress!— Beneath the myriad eyes of that still Sky Cowering the conscious Ocean seemed to lie, With faint soft murmuring, finely-wrinkled swell; As if it scarcely dared to heave or sigh Beneath the fascination of their spell;— In brief, dear tortured Reader—it was near The dawn; and Sea and Sky were calm and clear. VII. Not far below the Port the Ship had left, The hills into a little cove were cleft; The stony faces of the cliffs thus rent Showed twisted strata, strangely earthquake-bent, Running on each side circularly up— A great grey hollow like a broken cup! From crest and crevice, tortuously flung Those monstrous iron-hearted myrtles hung— Stiff snaky writhing trunks, and roots that clave And crawled to any hold the ramparts gave. Below, the level floor of sea-smoothed stone Was all scooped out and scored by wear and tear Of tides into round baths, and channels—bare Or with sea-windflowers, scarlet-ringed, o'ergrown: And big clay-coloured rocks and boulders,—dropt From mould-like hollows in the cliffs above, Where others like them sticking still outcropped,— Lay scattered round the margin of the cove. Look! in the starlit stillness, there and then, A boat emerging from the gloom appears; Rowed by four stalwart, darkling, silent, men, With muffled oars and faintest plash scarce heard; No sound beside, but the rare muttered word Of brief command from him who mutely steers And keenly round him through the darkness peers. How cautiously her channelled way she feels, And towards the rocks above the tideline steals! There with suspended oars the boatmen wait, Careful lest even their drip be heard; the Chief Steps out and listens on the lonely reef. No sight—no sound of anything that lives— A ‘cooey!’ low and cautious, then he gives. See! one of those clay-coloured rocks, descried Dimly from where, with boathook held, the skiff, Lies gently tilting with the lapping tide, Seems, 'mid its dumb companions 'neath the cliff With life and motion suddenly endowed! It rises—swiftly running—leaping o'er The stony-ribbed and channel-furrowed floor; See! 'tis a female form—a graceful shape Not even the clay-hued mats that thickly drape The head and shoulders, all the figure shroud— Can wholly hide; and see! as it draws near And Ranolf ('twas none other) runs to meet And with glad gesture greet the vision dear, Beneath the hood—this time no doubtful dream— Two great delighted sparkling eyes appear— And such a wan glad face, so wan and sweet, And kindling with triumphant love supreme! VIII. An ardent pressure of the hand (before That crew) a whisper of fond cheer—no more; And in the boat he makes her take her seat;— “Push off, my lads—look sharp!”—and from the shore They steal; while she, her trustful heart at last At peace, albeit from apprehension past Still fluttering with a somewhat quicker beat, Crouches by that loved form; and by degrees With his rude comrades learns to feel at ease, Confiding in the rough respect she sees They pay to his sea-knowledge—ready hand— Firm lip—and eye accustomed to command. The men ‘give way’ with vigorous strokes, nor fear Nor care who now may see the boat or hear; With hoisted sail to catch what airs there be, She soon is gently trampling through the sea. The Ship that in the offing, out of sight Had with scarce flapping canvas hung all night Becalmed, now as the breeze begins to rise With topsails backed and filled alternate, lies About one spot, till o'er the clearing main The boat returning is descried again. Then, with her yards braced round, and fair inclined, She lets them curve out boldly to the wind, Tacks towards the boat, and soon receives on board The wondering Maid, to life and love restored! How all this had been planned need we describe? That night when Ranolf found the drowned alive; How he had won, and hardly had to bribe The bluff Ship-Master's soon-accorded aid; How, unobserved, while for the Ship he stayed, The neighbouring coast he carefully surveyed And found a cove whence they could well embark; How 'twas agreed that Amo should contrive After the Ship's departure, in the dark, When towards the morning all were sunk in sleep, Out of the village secretly to creep, And to the spot he pointed out repair; There wait until she saw his boat arrive; And do the same, as he would—'twas agreed— If obstacles were met with, and need were— Night after night, until they should succeed. IX. Then, as some choice and cherished plant, erewhile A thousand-blossomed wonder and a show— Camellia or Azalea—one great pile Of rounded knots of lovely-moulded snow, Starring the glistening gloom of dark-green leaves With such luxuriance in simplicity, A purity so lavish and so free;— Or one unbroken broad diaphanous flush Of delicate flow'rets, luminous and lush As they were fashioned of the finest blush Of light, the heart's core of soft summer-eves, The tenderest recess of sunset, weaves;— As such a Plant—if set in hard-bound soil Where cutting winds could wither and despoil, Till cankered leaves and scanty blooms declared How ill in such environment it fared; But then again transferred from clay and cold To some warm nook of mellow-crumbling mould, Reviving and re-blooming would outburst In all the glory it could boast at first:— Even thus did Amo, and in days as few As this in months, her fairest charms renew; Thus, rooted in the soil of rich Content And breathing Love's serenest element, Recovered fast, elastic and erect— The sprightliness of form by sorrow checked; Once more, its supple roundness, sinuous grace, With slim and slender vigour chastely vied; Her eyes regained their dancing lights—her face Its winning frankness—sweet and sunny pride; Thus did she, brilliant as again a bride, The shape and hues of happy health resume, And all her wild magnificence of bloom! X. So, with its loving freight, to scenes untold— As daybreak wrapt her in its rosy fold, So—down and down, beneath the horizon's brink— Hull—sails—and masts—did that lone Vessel sink, And melt into the flood of morning gold. The Husband-lover and the lover-Wife Dipped down into the chequered deep of Life! So vanished—gliding down the blue hill-slope Of Ocean into an abyss of Hope; Plunged deep and deeper, every day that flew In golden gulfs of bright Expectance—new Experience—all of glad and glowing True Or glorious Seeming, that can soothe and bless Youth, Fancy, fondest Love, with dreams of Happiness! Canto the Seventh. After-Experiences. 1. Ranolf will learn that all Life is unsatisfying; and deem it a plan devised to win Man from over-regard for its beauty. 2. And that the Earth is a school for development of Soul, and the greatest works of Mind only students' essays. 3. Will not value Life too much. 4. Yet get his soul harmonized with it. 5. May conclude that ‘Science’ even may find a Law, in ‘Circumstance’ moulding individual lives and fortunes. 6–11. Will feel more and more the importance of the ‘Probable’; and of all creeds and philosophies (Buddhism, Hegelism, Christianity, etc.) pointing to the same great Truth or system of Truths—such, for instance, as the intelligent government of the Universe and the final welfare of spiritualized Humanity. 12. Anyhow the sanguine one will still hold to Truth— an ineffable Good Spirit, and a boundless Hope. I. Of Ranolf's feelings in the after-day, His special findings by Life's varied way, But little further—little fuller—may This realistic record sing or say. In that first greatest grief his youth had felt, 'Tis true his unformed Spirit had escaped The threatened doom, the shattering blow that might By his Soul-Sculptor's hammer have been dealt. Perhaps—who knows? there was no need to smite: Perhaps the marble could with blow more slight Or shadow of that heavy one, be shaped: For he was of a nature that delight Could sooner than despair, refine and melt. Yet—never doubt it—Life and Time must teach Him too what they enforce on all and each; That for all Souls, however richly dowered, With amplest gifts by fate or fortune showered, Something, where to the full they seem possest, Will surely seem deficient in the best; Or those that seem complete will flit or fade Long ere the thirst they cause can be allayed. Their sure effect, designed or not, 'tis clear, Is to make one, old, world-wide Truth appear— Man ne'er shall find full satisfaction here; Must learn while bound upon this earthly ball, The power and practice to renounce them all. Yes! doubt it not; he too in time will glean A glimpse so far into the mighty Plan, Into the working of this strange Machine The Universe; and what mysterious ways The Wonder-worker takes to solve The problem he has set himself; to make His glorious World in one rich round revolve Of beauty and attractiveness; yet wean By Good disguised as Evil—helpless Man Her nursling, from her lovely breast And bid him from the sleep awake Wherein contented else he would for ever rest. II. Then—for the tasks of Life;—whate'er the sphere Wherein his fleeting forces may be spent Will he not learn, herein too, Life was lent But as one stage for our development?— God's studio is this Earth, And we, His pupils, for instruction sent, Are pottering at our work of little worth But to attain to faculties that here Reach no perfection, or at least complete No works that seem for such perfection meet. How oft does mastery, even the most assured, Moral or mental, seem in vain secured! Our poets—artists—heroes—those Whose ripening powers or ripened could not fail, Their transient tools and organs lose, Oft when their Souls seem fittest to prevail— Most apt for thoughts or deeds sublime! As if their lives were but a blossoming time; They students—and the works they leave, So far beneath what they conceive, But tyros' crude essays to what in vain Their fond imaginations long indeed In this life—but in this life are in train Only in larger—loftier to achieve; Essaying here, but elsewhere to succeed; (Thy favourite faith, my Poet many-souled— All Intellect alight with Argus-eyes untold!) Till not alone the buds of beauty left By Nature's younger darlings soon bereft Of life and lyre—too soon!—a Shelley made All spirit—nay—frail spirit-tortured flesh Self-fevering through false theories, griefs and heats And phantasms, to pure Spirit; or a Keats, In senses for a human Soul too fresh And keen and fine, too dangerously arrayed; Our young-eyed Cherubim, who like poor bees Over a citron-blossom lifeless curled, Not half their honey gathered for the world, Died at their sweet vocation;—O not these— Nor the rathe buds of amaranth they seize— But roses fully blown; the gorgeous train Of bright humanities a Shakespeare's brain Bids into being, deathless and intense, Reflecting God's own Life-crowd—hue for hue And gleam for gleam—so varied—vivid—true— The double Rainbow's second Arch, in stripe And stain scarce dimmer than its archetype!— Even these, to his great Spirit taken hence, Seem left but like the drooping coronet Of threaded anthers hanging still around Some tiny nectarine-fruit, green, newly-set; The poor triumphant relic that once crowned Its flowering-time incipient, immature; Just dropping from the fruit that must expand To golden richness in the radiance pure Of wider Skies and some diviner Land! III. And as the Will Supreme intends Life's highest work as means, not ends: Its joys and pleasures, coarse—refined— Alike to be renounced—resigned; Will he not feel at last, and see The more for every misery, The rolling seasons as they flee, To him too, as to all mankind Full surely will dispense—decree,— That Life itself is meant to be Held loosely—lightly?—as one day When he with Amohia gay Roamed in that earliest bliss of love, He held upon his open palm A slender beetle silver-bright Beneath, all pure grass-green above; And bade her come and look how fair The dainty creature, 'lighted there And running to his finger-tip To gain a vantage-ground to slip Off into air, its native balm; “So should we hold this Life” he thought, “So watch with interest, deep delight, The flitting thing with beauty fraught, Long as it lingers in our sight;— So let it take, nor e'er repine, When go it must, its mystic flight, Into the limitless Divine!” IV. And he will feel—for such as he, Of healthy frame and reason free, Are more than most, secure to feel, As straight he steers through rocks and shoals, What haven rests for noble souls! Yes, he will feel through woe and weal, The power of Time to soothe and heal; And tune the Soul to full concent With its surrounding element. The wear and tear of right and wrong Less injure than befriend, the strong; And cheerful heart and chastened will Uplift them; and Experience still Maturing, lends a master's skill, Life's rich Harmonium-reeds to sound, Once dumb, or so discordant found; With easy stop some pain prevent; With facile touches, lightly thrown, Give simpler pleasures fuller tone; And from the ebon-ivory range Of chequered days and chance and change, Draw symphonies serene and strange, Melodious Music of Content. They gain, like fruits, as ripe they grow, More sweetness, with a sunnier glow; Till, mellowing ever, they begin The faith as very truth to hold— The best of worlds is that wherein Is much of Evil, so-called ‘Sin’; With active wish and earnestness To make that ‘Sin’ and Evil less. So by degrees to Fate they mould The Will that seemed so uncontrolled; And patience comes—and passions cool; And where they once were ruled, they rule; Love's wing grows wider—Thought's more bold The iron bonds are turned to gold; The chafing and restraint are past; And what were chains at first, are ornaments at last. V. And what if he one day shall see, nor dream— Though from the Soul's own intimate emotions It be conceded the profoundest notions Of the unfathomable unison Between it and the Universe be won— What if it grow with gathering years more plain, That the divine Developer's Life-Scheme Might yet by Science in her own domain, The Positive—that euphrasy and rhue, The mental vision from the mists to purge Of Speculation beyond Reason's verge— Be caught a glimpse of; with no logic-strain, Transcendent or empiric, or the twain United, over-subtle for sound brain; But patient observation, record true Of all the agencies clear sight may trace Of Circumstance, beyond its own control That make and mould each individual Soul Of myriad myriads of the human race;— Of all the hints and seeming accidents, Felicitous and opportune events, Though slight, so often from without supplied, The balanced Will that seems so free, to guide; And be the fountains of a cataract wide Involving the whole being in its tide! All that strange Loom of Life that round us plays, That made the grand old Greek, beyond all praise, The wisest, bravest, best, of Ancient Days, Paint it a guardian Angel by his side— His prescient Diotima piteous-eyed. All this shall make at last a Science grand Of Circumstance—no sceptic shall withstand, Wherein shall be perceived a law and laws, Not to be gathered from a single mind, But myriad inner histories combined; And in the laws, clear purpose, conscious Cause. What! shall the very Winds of heaven that rise And sink and run their seeming reckless round, Like Tartar cavalry scouring the wide skies Intractable and trackless! shall all these And every Storm that tears the limitless seas, Ranging the Ocean's amplitude—be found Obedient to fixed Law—to Order bound?— Shall all that shifting swift Aurora-dance, Those phantom revels round the secret Poles, Be set to God-made music that controls And bids each brilliant spasm up-leap and glance By happy rule—harmonious governance? Yet this—Humanity's abounding Mould, The ever-active matrix manifold Of Spirit, restless round Earth's millions rolled, This vast Machinery for making Souls, Be but chaotic Force—the child of Chance?— A vain surmise!—but as that Law of Storms Cannot be gathered from a single breeze Or local gale; so must a myriad forms Of lives and their environments be learned And disentangled ere can be discerned The law that flows round each, unguessed, unseen, Like fluid wool that through the ribbed machine Which looks so bare, so finely runs and fast O'er whirling cylinders, a viewless stream, Till in a visible flue scraped off at last:— Even so, the presence of a Power supreme Shall be detected as its subtle way It works throughout the infinite whirl and play Of ever-rolling restless Circumstance; So from a million inmost beings scanned With cool and scrutinizing vigilance That marks each motive whencesoever brought, Each faintest impulse from without them caught; So may at last material pure be won Whence ductile threads of reasoning may be spun, Which all the strain of logic shall withstand; And such a radiant raiment woven alone By Intellect, as—warmly, widely thrown About the shivering Soul—shall make it feel Aglow with full assurance of eternal weal! VI. But in Life's starry twilight obscure, O be sure such a Wanderer as he Will the worth of the ‘probable,’ nay, of the ‘possible’ more and more see, As the limited rays of the gas-lamps of knowledge demonstrative press With their narrowness more on his soul, evermore to its nobler distress! VII. “But to me,” he would muse, “it seems ever more possible, probable too, That all Faiths and Philosophies, higher and lower, the old as the new Are but parts of one System sublime,—have Ideas universally true! Each that seemed an Aldebaran, Sirius once—but a fixed Sun or Star That must pant in its lordly seclusion, alone, independent, afar, Was or is—though by handbreadths in ages, approaching or moving around Some vast undefinable centre, some Truth through them all to abound! Of one Mystery all revelations, though outlets so varied they try; Sheet-lightnings that glimmer responsive from opposite points of the Sky! All but tones of one measureless Music revolving in symphony sweet, Where the deep rich Eternity's bass must the chimes of Existence complete! VIII. “Thus more rational ever it seems that the vague transcendentalist's cloud Of the ‘Absolute’ must, to be real, as with orient hues, be endowed With the qualities (since without any 'twere quite inconceivable still) Of Intelligence Infinite ever—no less than Omnipotent Will, Whose manifold manifest tokens the visible Universe fill! The identical ‘Mind’ then 'twould be, whose Idea Divine like a gleam From itself, could for Plato illumine his shadowy groves Academe; And anew,—by the sandy hot glare where those time-eaten monoliths brown On the solemn inscrutable Sphinx, as the sunshine eternal, look down, Or the date-palms of Nile, ruddy-golden, its cacao-dark overflow crown,— Vary-starred the Mosaics of Philo,—in Christian Theosophy soared Of Tertullians and Plato-fed Clements, who welcomed it, loved and adored (Since their Infinite must be defined!) as their ‘Reason’—their ‘Logos,’ their Lord, Self-existent ere all things began—ere it spoke itself forth as their ‘Word’!— How these lofty Ideas—so essential to Man—ever shoot up and shine O'er the dim Sea of Ages unchanged—like the spouts of the Whale o'er the brine Far apart, yet, as true as from shots ricochetting, unswerved from one line! Lo, the Mind over-ruling Platonic—the Logos Patristic—itself Long before more than crudely conceived in the creed of that mystical Elf— Hoary-headed and sixty years old at his birth—the ‘Old Boy’—Lao-tse!— Philosophical rattle the reverend Babe in oracular play O'er his senior-juniors shook, as he lisped them in long-tailed Cathay Of the ‘Absolute’ all he could guess—as the ‘Taou’—the ‘Method’—the ‘Way’ Of the Mystery when from its lake of primordial stillness it steals Down the Universe-River serene, and its intimate presence reveals As a simple ‘Becoming,’—spontaneous—effortless—void of all aim,— Yet attaining—evolving—resulting in harmonized Nature the same!— Once again, lo! that “Method’—‘Mind’—‘Logos’;—thinly masked by a scholarly name,— From the subtle mild East meditative—the fervid fanatical South— Irrepressible notion! upsprings in the Northern cold sceptical drouth;— Reappears like a vanished revolving Sea-Light slow-reviving aflame,— As your ‘Immanent Reason’!—for this too, a Will all-püissant must claim Like the rest; since though leaving the Good, while the Ages the issue await, Through the Cosmos we ken of to wrestle with Evil and ravin and hate, 'Tis invested with might to o'errule the mystic and multiform fray— Can coerce the two foes internecine—the duel æonian sway Till the higher as Victor come forth in some new indescribable Day! But the Day! what should it be and when?—when the ‘Absolute’, might we not say— Shall flood the new skies with pure gold—shall its perfect predominance prove In the triumph of Light without limit—the reign of unlimited Love!— What if this were the high ‘reconciling Idea’ which all others transcends; ‘And to realize, organize which the whole Universe struggles and tends’— If this ‘Absolute’ were but the Love which with Reason eternally blends!— Then Philosophy were—an ally—in Religion's best colours attired; Then the Unity Hegel the Thinker less clearly conceived than desired, Were the ‘Notion’ the Nazarene taught, by his heart's simple grandeur inspired! IX. “And that other Idea Immortality (surely 'twere truthlike to say), Should it e'er seem extinct, will survive,—take what fashion soever it may! Will array itself yet in new robes of acceptance; new warranty find For the favour—caresses more coy—more fastidious faith of Mankind! O the grand old Belief they will keep, that the Soul to best reasoning still— In Matter's despite—but a drop from the Ocean of Infinite Will— But a Sun-ray from Infinite Energy—ever fate-driven to yearn By its restlessness under the Finite, with longings that quenchlessly burn For the Infinite—is to that Infinite destined at last to return! How Religions reflect one another! how vital that notion was found In the East reappearing of old as the natural human rebound Of Cathayan and Thibetan millions Gautama's illusions unsound Had revolted, when first on Mankind a practical trial was made Of the Nihilist dream; and the saintly and sated Beguiler essayed, From his half-view of Life as all Evil, to tempt men by æons of pain Still renewed (so immortal by Nature this Life was!) to gain Stone-stupidity—blockish no-being! to highest Morality strain Suicidally mad to grow mortal; buy Death with all Life has of best; Be divinest in worth to be worthy destruction! and mockingly blest, For a million sad years' self-denial be marred with one moment of Rest!— And surely our modern negation that smothers in Positive smoke Of the senses that primal pure flame will a kindred reaction provoke! Bid the Future repicture the ancient persuasion—some fresh way unfold How—emerging at first from the Absolute—trailing its glory and gold,— As the current electric, a Hermes outwinging that swift one of old, From magnetic Abysses emerges,—the soul too, though hurried amain— Borne along on its wire of Life, to the Absolute dipping again, On its own individual circuit a mystical hold can retain! Can its special electrical thread of conscious identity keep; Or should conscious identity vanish, no less through the Infinite Deep, In channels of new isolation, itself with new Self could array; Never lost 'mid the myriad millions of like Life-currents that stray In the Absolute realm multitudinous weaving their wonderful way To what Pole—but the Highest Perfection! why, say to the Jewel sublime In the Lotus!—though truly all figures as fastened in Space and in Time Fail to picture the Absolute out of them,—still, as in Dantean rhyme, All the Blest billion-throned make a snowy-white Rose far-horizoned, world-wide, In its amphitheatral immensity mirrored serene in the crystal light-tide Fed brimful from that Fount of Perfection; while bee-swarms of Angels flame-bright Up and down ever flitting and dipping in splendours that veil It from sight, With their golden soft-winnowing wings fetch and fan them new peace and delight,— Why, if Nature makes Orient millions those happy foreshadowings share, Why discard the fine witness in favour of Hope the wise heretics bear, When they image what none can imagine—the Absolute Presence compare To the Lotus that crowns the still waters of Infinite Life with its bloom; And around its pure Essence of light-killing Light will assemble—illume— All the boundlessly clustering petals, to circle its glorious Orb— All the Spirits its Love will inform—so in bliss of its Being absorb!— Then the future forlorn of the Soul which the saturnine Sakyan wooed Were rekindled to harmony bright with convictions the healthier mood Of a consciousness still more majestic, a sympathy ampler, indued; So were peasant-meek Prince with yet princelier Peasant—Gautama the Good With the grand Galilean at one; so the Aryan Lotus would shine The Semitic high ‘House of the Father’—the home ‘many-mansioned’—divine! X. Nay, that Positive Science methinks (why should Truth that expectancy bar?) Through its prison-grate peering may hail the high-peaks sky-developed afar; Not alone, by keen insight of all that the springs of Life-streams may affect, Like the mighty Athenian Martyr, within its own realm unsuspect, Some unguessed under-guidance discern—a supreme Diotima detect; But the realm may enlarge till its laws—so consummate to deal with that ‘wire’ May the Soul-current's self apprehend, and show to our dearest desire How its circuits invisible must through the Cosmos eternally range, Or its negative Finite recharged to an Infinite positive change!— Then its ‘God’—that ‘Humanity’ too, no prairie on fire would be, Ever-dying,—but rather the world-wide unwithering Igdrasil Tree The old Norseman conceived it; therein could its nobler divinity see! From its furthermost fibre of root to the leaf on its uttermost spray Still informed with the sap of true being—the sunshine of shadowless Day! So were worth adoration perhaps—amaranthine—transplanted on high!— Or, advancing from system to system star-peopling the mystical Sky, Say its myriad forms never-resting, in purer Valhallas might vie, Of ever-new excellence emulous,—spirits that ceaselessly prove Their prowess in rivalry finer of loftier, luminous Love!— XI. “How, but ends of broad rays, all these Faiths, under cloud-skirts too vast to dispel, Though they slant up at angles opposed, to one centre yet pointing so well, Of the great hidden Splendour—the Soul's happy destiny—solemnly tell!”— XII. But whatsoever he may dream or see Of Facts acceptable in each degree Of requisite assuredness; Those lowlier, Logic proves yet must confess Ne'er to be wholly fathomed—known; Those loftier, best Emotions bid us own; One feeling never will he cease to share,— The cheery faith that all things, foul or fair, For some wise purpose must be as they are; The Evil but a scheme, half understood, For better evolution of the Good!— —Not cease; though ever will the sanguine-hearted, With greater zeal by Time and Life imparted, Swear fearless fealty in age as youth, To highest Reason and all-questioning Truth!— And ever will exclaim, With thought as daring, earnestness the same: “O heat of loving Heart! O light of chainless Mind! When will conviction flash on dull mankind, That you are One and True; to doubt you, false and blind! And O, thou Great First Cause ineffable! O Being In infinite ubiquitous persistence By our conceptions inconceivable—to all our seeing Invisible! yet forced upon us as unknown Existence By all Existence known! O Thou The source of Soul and Nature, Man and Brute Whom in this sensuous deep thou dost immerse— Thou hast ordained that deep shall still avow Thyself—some shadow of Thyself reveal— Potent o'er inmost consciousness to steal; A conscious brooding Presence—through thy Universe For ever everywhere intrusive— For ever everywhere elusive— Resistlessly suggestive, yet inexorably mute!— Aye! strange the Mystery, and fathomable never, Of everything that is—this actual Here and Now— Impenetrable still—yet interpenetrated ever With a divineness beaming through the dark, Ubiquitous—unceasing!—from the highest cope Of heaven with Astral Systems flung along its slope To the minutest microscopic spark Or speck of life obscure in air or earth or sea— Some viewless animalcule—such a vivid shield Of trembling rings of iridescent splendour The very Rainbow by its side would yield The palm—has no such glory to attend her As we are startled to find there, unseen By unassisted sense!—so manifest a glow Of Beauty and Power transcendent from below Rises to meet the Power and Beauty above That through those star-worlds limitless expand— And stealing through our Finite's dimmest screen, Leavens the Universe with Light and Love! Until we feel, we darkling men— So darkling in our nook of narrow days And cramping thoughts and creeping ways— As in the midst, longing for light, between That Infinitesimal and Infinite we stand— Feel that the Finite's evil and its haze Are destined to be lost, transfigured in the blaze Of the abounding Presence, eloquent then, Of that life-giving Beauty and Power divine— Say rather, O Unnameable, of Thine!— Thou—in this Mystery, starry-dark as night, Yet beautiful and wonderful beyond the scope Of utmost admiration—yet a pure delight, A joy exhaustless by all thirst For joy Thyself didst plant within us first,— Thou hast ensured that we may rest In one conviction not to be supprest— For us whatever destiny Thou dost ordain, must be the fittest—best! Thou hast therein writ thy decree It shall for Man for ever be Inevitable to conclude Thee good and just; Most rational to hold a boundless Hope; Most inwardly ennobling utterly to trust In the firm stronghold of the True and Right, And widest Love's unconquerable might, As best sustainment of his being's height— Best revelation of Thy Will and Thee!— Therefore we blench not! therefore boldly say: ‘O Man! thou momentary ray Shot from the hidden Splendour far away— Sheet-lightning gleam of a perceptive power Taking wide Nature's surface for its dower; O phantom-puppet of miraculous clay! Thou that art launched into the infinite void Upon thy sparkling bubble-world upbuoyed; And—as an Insect on a floating leaf Runs to and fro incapable of flight, And works and waves in air its horns so slight,— Dost ever, on thy voyage brief, Keep stretching towards some unimagined goal Hid in the blank abyss of Light The feeble feelers of thy Soul! Poor Atom on the Ocean of the All— Hold bravely onward! faint not yet nor fall— Some day shall come full answer to thy call!’” Enough—the homely reel of Life we hold— Of Amo's life and Ranolf's is unrolled; She and her thoughtful thoughtless Wanderer bold, Slight subjects of a lingering theme. Faint visions of a too protracted dream, Sink down—and like the ghosts of every-day, The solid real flesh-phantoms—fade away!</field>
