      <field name="fulltext">[The generous Reader, whose free honest soule] Musa crucem cecinit dudum quæ carmine Christi, Ælizæ varias iam canit illa cruces Ælizæ qúe cruces crucifixi nomine passas: O quam te memorem Virgo, virago, dea, O nullus laceret liuor Levere labores, Pergat at in studijs casta Minerua pijs. The generous Reader, whose free honest soule, Did loue the honor'd subiect of thy Booke, Will for her sake (whose loue liues in the roule Of datelesse Memorie) lend a friendly looke. As others Gardens haue bestowed floures, To decke her Garlands, and to strew her herse; So thy graue Muse doth tell her grieued houres, And sings her sorrowes in a sollemne verse: That though deuouring Time did to bereaue her, Of Palme and Pittie with her foes conspire; Yet thy loue Leuer lets not Honor leaue her, But by the heate of kinde Poetike fire Reuiu'd, giu'st virtue her deserued hire. R. K. My loue to the Argument, and the Author. The times are now maleuolent to Verse, (To verse that trauells in graue Argument,) Yet thy graue Muse adornes the sable Herse Of her, whose glories were most eminent. In this thy Art hath well deseru'd of Fame, That thou Elizaes glories dost commend, And that in Verse she hath a liuing name, And that her Teares (in verse) by thee are pen'd. O the depraued pleasures of vilde men, That haue no pleasure in this moouing Arte! And O those spirits, whose licentious Pen Haue made these trauells of so small desert! When men were better, then, the times were so, And Verse had then their high deseruing praise: Now Time is old, he doth in weakenesse goe. All things (in worth) doe alter as their Daies. Let not the faults of men and euill Time Dis-heart thy spirite from Poetike fire: Thy Verse is free from all dishonest Rhyme, And from the tract of Cupids idle sire, This is the glorie, that thy Muse doth sing The holie secrets of the holie Crosse; And of this Saint, and of her suffering, In which expence of time there is no losse. Then sith that thus thy trauells doe indeuour, I doe not see but Leuer may liue euer. Robert Posket Queene Elizabeths Teares: Or, Her resolute bearing the Christian Crosse. I that haue reacht my meditation hie, And versd the holy suffrings of my Lord, Still doe I mooue in that emperiall Skie, Where Saints and holy Angels do afford Subiect that may diuinest wit accord: I glory then, that to my Verse is giuen, This care to fet their holy cause from heauen. Among the number of those holy Saints, A happy Lady, where all happies are, Whose name Report in euery place acquaints, Who like the beauty of the fairest Starre, In beauteous name exceedes all other farre: And but we doe except the Virgin-mother, We reach her praise as high as any other. Thus I conceiue her Image in my thought; Clad in the Virgin ornament of white, Within that white her innocence was wrought, Vnspotted with the touch of vaine delight, Her habite is all day, and nothing night: And in that white (as my remembrance saith) Was writ this motte, Defendor of the Faith. Her presence could expresse what she had beene, Humble, yet full of princely maiestie; A constant Martire, yet a royall Queene; Before her state went much aduersitie, In all proportions Iudgement might descry What holy motions mooued in her hart, For holy signes of prayer did mooue each part. Vpon her head a Coronet of golde, To intimate her eminence of place; But in her royall presence I beholde, The Image both of Maiestie and Grace, The heart of State was grauen in her face: Let him in iudgement be reputed blinde, That in the face sees nothing of the minde. Within one hand she held an armed blade, (Whereon was writ her many victories;) The other with much reuerence she laide, Vpon the Booke of heauenly mysteries; As if that God in wisedome did deuise, To giue this Ladie that victorious Sword, To garde the passage of his holy word. Before her feete a Globe of earth was cast, Scepters, and Crownes, and markes of high estate; Yea Kings themselues and Potentates were plac't, In humble ranke before this Magistrate; Their fortunes on her victories did waite: For when that she would fauour or cast downe, The bad had warre, the better had the Crowne. These Trophies doe erect eternall name, That euer liues in honour of this Queene; That giue occasion vnto busie Fame, To make report what her deserts haue beene: My selfe that haue these admirations seene; In humble verse her suffrings doe relate, That dare not meddle with her time of State. This cogitation of this Princely one, Is often entertained in my minde; Waking, or not, I oft reuise thereon, And often in my thoughts this Queene I finde, And oft her glad remembrance hath inclinde To heart my verse, that writ the holie Passion, Of her religious Teares to make relation. O thou that dost inspire with holie flame, The moouing spirits of deepe Poesie; Giue me to adde some honour to her name, That wants her due of holy memorie: For Time will rot our best mortallitie. And sith that she all vertuous ones did cherish, It pittie were her vertuous name should perish. O let my verse mooue indignation, And stirre the blood of better abled wit: Enuie, or shame of this relation, May hap beget the meanes to better it: How ere my shame, it doth my liking fit, By anie meanes to adde vnto her praise, Our loue is in our heart, not in our phrase. When holy Edwards Spirit did expire, Borne on the wings of Angells into blisse; The earth grew cold and wanted holy fire, When this diuine defendor parted is, Blacke Night did then succeed this Day of his: For then the glory of the day is done, When interposed earth bedims the Sunne. O the exceeding wisedome in the heauen, Whose prouidence protecteth euery care: To seely men the licence is not giuen, To see forbidden secrets what they are; In vaine vpon the face of heauen men stare, To know the hidden cause of that effect, Which in Gods secret will is hidden kept. Tell me, thou wisest in iuditious Arte, (Or if thou canst not tell, I silence thee) Why God remou'd this holy King apart, And left his Church to open tyrannie: You reade not in the Starres this secrecie: He that all futures can discerne afarre, Within his breast these secrets hidden are. Now Time had set this glorious Sonne of grace, To darkenesse he his Empire did resigne; Darkenesse that long had ouerspread the face Of holy truth and vertuous discipline; No light apparant where no light may shine: And but the fires of Martires that gaue light, All had beene blacke, and in eternall night. You that haue nothing holy but your name, That did incence this Marie vnto blood; Be it to you your euerlasting shame, So to corrupt her nature that was good; O had she had the spirite to withstoode You that did hearten her to her disgrace, She had deseru'd preheminence of place. To saue a world of sinners you pretend, But you intend another by pretence: Religious duties often you commend, Yet interdict you our obedience, You bid speake truth, but in a double sence: How can your teaching many spirits saue, When words and works such contradictions haue? These Instigators fill her hands with blood, (In all respects saue this a vertuous Queene) What they made vitious would haue prooued good, Had not their powrefull prouocations beene, Vpon her name this blood had not bin seene: And men of holy place be sure of this, Where you touch blood, the marke apparant is. This Ladie (in the number of the rest) Indur'd the storme of persecution: Highest in griefe, and in her name the best, And with the best maintain'd her resolution, She (like the Lamb prepar'd for execution) Doth still exspect by loosing of her breath, To giue her holy cause a holy death. And reason had she of this iust suspect, (So strange was alteration in the State) Within her Sisters face she found neglect; And friends doe euer faile th'vnfortunate, The present state men onelie estimate: For as the wind transports the flying Aire, So, as times alter, men stil fliers are. Her house in Edwards time a little Court, Full of the fawning seruice of the knee: But Marie now cuttes off this full resort, And men fall backe in their Apostasie; The Cuckooes sing not where colde winters be: And Time this Lady of her port bereaues, As winter frosts nip off the falling leaues. These were the first beginnings of her care, Which (like the heads of little rising springs) Runne to a larger bignesse than they were: So Time that fauours not this Ladie, brings Still fresh supplie vnto her sufferings; Like flouds that with their swelling tides are fed, Till falling Seas doe make their waters ebbe. Here might she spend her holie meditation, (As sure she did much holier than I write) She alters not with Fortunes alteration: Resolue had made her sufferings her delight, Her holie cause did giue her holie might: To beare the indignation of their spleene, That made her Sister her offended Queene. O thou eternall Spirite (thus she saies) Without whose pleasure nothing hath euent: Before we be, thou numbrest all our daies, And preordainest euerie accident; To thee all things that be, themselues present. And I, that for thy holie Name must die, Imbrace the cause, and thanke thy Maiestie. What ere I suffer is in thy decree, Which limits all the purposes of men: My selfe, my cause I consecrate to thee, Let them cut off vncertaine life, yet then Ile breathe it in thy sacred hands; and when My Sister Marie offers vp my blood, Ile offer vp my heart to make it good. My Sauiour Iesus suffered more than I, And for my sake, that Lord he suffered. The righteous One did for the sinnefull die, And gaue his life for ours that perished. Thy seruant is by thy example led, To die for Truth, sith Truth did die for me, For thus to die, is lifes eternitie. What is my life the world should enuie so? (Alas) a little puffe of breathing aire; Death hath ten thousand meanes to let it goe, And flie this wearie bodie of my care, Vncertaine I to loose it when, or where. Ther's somewhat else than breath they care for than, For breath is common vnto euery man. It is for Conscience and Religions cause, That I indure this burthen of their hate; How ere guiltlesse, yet the wrested Lawes Must correspond in iudgement with the State, For that is lawe our Gouernours relate: And though by Law my innocence be proou'd, The Case will alter, if the Prince be moou'd. Be it that Gods preuenting eie should sleepe, And that their purpose haue desired end: That Soule they take from me they cannot keepe, Which to a mighty Lord I recommend; His right he can against all clames defend: How fruitles is the haruest which they make, That cannot keepe the treasure which they take? Men are iniurious that report of Death, To be the highest of extremities; Whenas we die, what loose we else but breath? And many numbers of our miseries, When this life setts, a better doth arise: And when to Death a holy cause is giuen, Death is the Gate by which we enter heauen. Within our life these sorrowes we containe, Vncertaine daies, yet full of certaine griefe, In number few, but infinite in paine: O're chargde with wants, but naked of reliefe, In ruling it our euill partes are chiefe: And though our time be not cut short by Death, Olde age will creepe to stop vncertaine breath. Yet to the much affliction of the minde, This of the body is a scant compare; Wherein so many, and so much I find, As would astonne my spirits to declare; Triall can onely tell vs what they are: For we whom Custom hath with griefe acquainted, By vs her sad proportion best is painted. The Griefe of mind is that intestine warre, That stirres sedition in the state of man; Where, when our Passions once commaunders are, Our peacefull dayes are desperate, for than The stirre's more hote, than when it first began; For heady Passion's like an vntam'd beast, That riots most, when we desire it least. This violence exceedes his vertuous meane, Like swelling tides that ouerrunne their shore, Leauing the lawfull current of their streame, And breake their bankes that bounded them before: Yet griefe in his great, violence is more: For if that Reason bound not Griefe with Lawes, In our destruction Griefe will be the cause. Griefe should be borne with much indifference, Not much regarded, yet regardlesse neuer; Not much affected, yet we must haue sense, To feele our griefe and apprehend it euer; Yet let the grieued euer thus indeuer; To make his burthen easefull as hee may, And so his griefe with ease is borne away. So much of Griefe we onely doe sustaine, As in our choice our selues do apprehend: Griefe may present it selfe, but not constraine That we imbrace what it doth recommend. Beare it but lightly then; for to that end Is Patience giuen, by whose resolued might, The heauiest loade of Griefe is made but light. This is the most of happinesse we haue, That with our Patience we support our cares. Not we our selues, but God this vertue gaue, Which our vnworthie life right well declares; To loose my life, is for to loose my cares. Then what is Death that I should feare to die? Death is the death of all my miserie. What then is that which doth beget desire In humane flesh to linger out long daies? Is it because to Honor men aspire? Or, for their name in Beautie hath a praise? Or, is't their greedy Auarice them staies? Honour, Beautie, nor desire of Golde, Cannot the certaine of their death withhold. Honour is nothing but a very name, Often conferd to men of little merite; In euery place; as common as is Fame, Commonly giuen to euery common spirite; So little worth as anie one may weare it. Then why should that be thought of estimation, That giues to base deseruings high creation? The name and place of honour may be giuen, As please the Prince in fauour to dispose; But true deriued Honor is from heauen, And often liues in meane estate with those, That to the courts of Princes neuer goes. How vainly prowd are such as would get Fame, Yet get no more of Honor but the name. Be it, thy Honour as the glorious Sunne Exceede the rate of common exspectation; Thy Prince displeased once, thy honor's done: In rising to this pitch men vse gradation, But at one fall they loose all estimation: For he whose powre is euer absolute, His angry breath can puffe thy glorie out. Where is the honour of great Macedon, That measur'd out large Empires with his Sword? Great Iulius is with many Cæsars gone, Leauing no more of Honour than the word, And but the pennes of Schollers that record; Old Time would bring their Honor to that shame, As Cæsar and the rest would haue no name. Who is't that now to Cæsar bends the knee, Or frames the sweete of wordes to please his eare? Who is't that now regardeth his Decree, Or his offended countenaunce doth feare? Cæsar in's Graue, his Honour is no where. If Honour thus doe perish in the best, What may be then expected in the rest? He that from enuious eie, and full resort, Liues priuate, with a little state content; Little desires the honour of the Court, Where emulation stirres a discontent. Men shoote at him that is most eminent: And whom the prince with hiest grace doth crown, Enuy brings many hands to pull him downe. See here the glorie of mortallitie, Which we with infinite of care pursue, Painefull to get, but lost at libertie; Fatall to many, fortunate to few, Whereto so many miseries insue, As filles our time with cares; then why should I For this respect of honour feare to die? Is Beauty then of that high consequence, Wherein I may disswasiue reason finde: Is that faire shadow of that excellence, That for the face I should exchange the minde? Beauty that blindeth many, cannot blinde My Reason so; for Beautie's but a floure, Which being pluckt it fadeth in an houre. What though the world with admirations eie, Gaze at the wondrous pleasure in the face; Wherein the greatest vse great industrie, Watching each little fauour to imbrace, And prowd themselues to be in Beauties grace: Yet when the best of Beauty men haue got, (If not olde Age) the Graue will make it rot. Where are those Beauties which the world admirde, That with attraction slau'd the hearts of men? Within their graues these Ladies are retirde, And all their beautie is decay'd with them; What is't in Beautie we should value then? For those that were of most admired face, Are now confined to a rotten place. Beautie is like a Comet in the Aire, Which being lighted by the burning Sunne, Seemes to the strange beholder wondrous faire; But when the matter of the light is done, The fire goes out: In like comparison, Let Beautie like the fairest starre be bright, Beauty will set, and be as blacke as night. It well befits the spirit of great blood, To loue that least which is of common vse; Then why should Beauty be esteemed good, Which many commons commonly abuse? For where in wisedome Nature doth refuse To giue to many beautie of the face, A little Arte will couer that disgrace. Looke, as the Earth bedeckt with beauteous flowres, (The pretty children of the earth and spring) Warm'd with the Sun, and fed with heauenly showres, Haue but a little time of tarrying: So, when the winter of our age shall bring Our fading time, our Beauty like the floure, Cannot this winter of our age indure. This nothing of desert cannot perswade, That I should feare this Image of my death; The beauty of the minde will neuer fade, Which I must value deerer than my breath: Who would aduenture heauen for little earth? The beauteous name of Truth for which I die, Exceedes the beautie of the fairest eie. If these respects haue not the powre to moue, That haue beene powrefull in great Potentates; For many great ones haue desired Loue, And for their Loue haue wasted great Estates, And for their Loue haue oft prou'd desperates. But for the base desire of hauing much, Neuer was any of the Princely such. He that of wealth desireth any more, Than may suffice an honest compotence; Fills to a vessell that is full before, Which ouerrunnes with prodigall expence, What Care put in with greedy diligence. Exceeding wealthy the contented are, That with their little haue but little care. Among great euills Auarice is chiefe, Attended on by many miseries, Whose like is well resembled in the Thiefe, Who thriueth most by many robberies: So he that would by greedie Mammon rise, Must like a Thiefe by some deuise or other, Make himselfe rich by taking from another. And hence it is, that men in euery trade, Haue secret Art to raise a wealthy state; Whereby their base beginnings oft are made, To large possessions wondrous fortunate: Yet righteous God that doth iniustice hate, Oft giues to wealth thus gotten such an Heire, Or freely spends what Auarice did spare. Desire of much doth oft beget desire, To rob the Orphane, and the widdow mother; Makes, that in bloud we many times conspire, Against the very bosomes of our brother; The couetous doe feede one of another: For when mens hearts on this Desire are set, They care not what the meanes be, so they get. And therefore is't that Law hath many Cases, And euery Case wrapt vp in double sense; And euery sense so traueld in Law places, As the Professour for his diligence, Must weare the Case that is in difference. Desire of wealth is then an euill cause, That thus corrupts the Tenor of good lawes. What should I number vp these euills more, Whose repetition grieues my better mind: Crœsus is gone with all his heaped store, Leauing no more than euill name behinde; Who can one penny of his treasure finde? Then Honour, Beauty, and Desire of gaine, Are pleasures that but little time remaine. God is my honour, God's the beauteous face, Which I with greedie appetite beholde; He is my treasure that I would embrace, He is my honour, beautie, and my gold: To purchase him, all others I haue solde. Sith I am Gods, and God is mine, then I Make it my (all) for this my God to die. Thus did this Ladie with herselfe dispute, And to her selfe she framde such argument, As in her purpose made her resolute, To beare what ere those euill times present. Griefe is not felt by one so patient: For what though men lay all their euills on vs, A little Patience beares their euills from vs. (Good Ladie) she had onelie this one care, (So holy Mary had but onelie one) How she for happie death might best prepare, For this she spends her cogitation, Her houres in prayer, her time in meditation: When Death comes thus to our prepared daies, We honour God, and get eternall praise. Such was the Saint, the Sinner was not so; Such was the Lambe, the Butcher different, Such was the Larke, the Bustard thats below, Mounts to a pitch to sease the innocent, The good, the bad, the base, the eminent: So opposite, as she in euills least, Suffers the prowd controlement of a Priest. (Steuen,) it was thy contriuement, and thy care; To persecute the cause for which Steuen bled. Betwixt two Steuens what differences are; Yet both of you with bloud were sprinckled, Thou martiredst many, he was martired. How ill it fittes thee to be called Steuen, Thy nature is from hell, thy name from heauen. Thou hadst the name and place of Gardner, To dresse the Vintage thou commaundest o're; But by thy hand, the hedges broken were, Which holy Church had fenced in before; And thou thy selfe (prowd Gardner) like a Bore, Rootst vp the floure, and fruitfull bearing tree, That in Gods holy Gardens fairest be. The reuerend name of Bishop that was giuen, Ill sorted with thy strong desire of blood; Those hie deseruings were not found in Steuen, That correspond the name of Fatherhood; Where all is euill, there is nothing good: And so thy names and nature disagree, As opposites in their extreamitie. Bishops (if they would correspond their name) Must be composde of mercifull respect; For God is such whence their creation came, Who hath from many numbers them select, To patterne holy life to Gods elect: And sith to Princes God hath giuen the Sword, Let them be princely onely in Gods word. What is't they be inuested in their white, And weare the holy Orders of their place? If vnto foule offence they haue delight; That will their whited vestiments disgrace, Pride, and Ambition in a Prelats face, Are vglie formes; nor is their Priesthoode good, That wash their hands in holy Martires blood. If any thinke I speake with enuious breath, And wrong the iust deseruings of this man, He is deceiu'd, it is Elizabeth, Whose tribulation she indured than, Stirres vp more angrie bloud than Enuie can: (And if the trueth in Stories be recorded,) He was the worst of men those times affoorded. Witnes this Ladie of deserued praise, Witnes the much affliction she indur'd, Witnes the number of her grieued daies, Witnes the prisons where she was immur'd, Witnes himselfe these euills that procur'd, Witnes the Saints that perisht in that fire, Which Steuen (like bellowes) kindl'd with desire. When she (good Ladie) is in holie praire, Or in the heauen of holy meditation; This Macheuillian doth his plottes prepare, How to incence the Queene with indignation, And to that end he makes a large relation: Which though the truth be not in Stories read, This for a truth may be imagined. (My Soueraigne, thus his enuy can begin) I that haue place in your affaires of State, And detestation of heretique sin, Am therefore bolde for to expostulate, And giue aduise vnto your high estate, In matter of most weighty consequence, Faithfull aduise is our best diligence. Elizabeth (O may I not offend) Your Sister (gratious Soueraigne) is not true Vnto your State, nor to your life a friend; She is the head of that rebellious crue, That mooues sedition in the residue. When Faction gets a head that's neere the Crowne, Wisedome would beat the head of Faction downe. Our Sister (saith the much offended Queene) (Bishop) be well aduised what you saie; We to our Sister haue right gratious beene, How is't that she in loue should fall away? We cannot thinke our Sister will betray. The Priest replide, If so your Grace will heare, Ile giue you instance, both of when and where. When Wyat with the mutinous in Kent, Moou'd a commotion in your quiet State, So dangerous that Wyat did present His rebell troopes before your princely Gate; Whome, though the heauens were pleasde to ruinate, Yet let it be within your princely care, To know the cause from whence these rebells were. Wyat (alas) a priuate Gentleman, Whose reputation neuer reacht so hie, As to be mark'd in State; could Wyat than With his weake credite raise a Companie, So warrelike as to match your Maiestie? (Madame be sure) a greater was the head, Although the body Wyat gouerned. In great attempts it's weighty pollicie, That whome the practise doth most neere respect, With false appearance they dissembled be, That if their bad designes haue bad effect, They may auoyde the danger of suspect; But if the practise haue desired end, The Plotters then the practise will commend. Your Sister learned in this suttle Arte, (Be pleasd to pardon plainenesse in my speach) Would not the secret of the Plot impart, Saue vnto Wyat, whom her Art could teach, To silence how Ambition made her reach: And though the Traitor to his death denie it, The truth of circumstance will verifie it. What other cause, saue Luthers discipline, Begat this ciuill discord in your State? Nor can your kingdomes holy Church resigne; Whilst that your princely selfe is Magistrate. Then sure these rebells she did animate, Your sacred life (by treason) to depriue, That she and Luther might the better thriue. Who is't but you that weares the princely Crowne, With which Ambition would adorne hir head? She cannot rise before your Grace be downe, Nor can she rule before your state be dead: This tricke of State would be considered. The Queene replide, (And saist thou so good Priest) Who then desireth all, she shall haue least. The times that followed were good testament, How much the Prelate did the Queene incence; For presently Commissioners were sent To Ashbridge house, to set the Lady thence, With strict command, to haste their diligence: So forcible was his perswasiue tongue, To make one Sister doe another wrong. These Ministers (in silence be their name) Posted their iourney with a greedie haste; For Euill is like double-winged Fame, That looseth breath by flying ouer fast; They runne the best to euill that runne last. And these that now (to please Queene Marie) flie, Will runne for Elzabeth, if Marie die. A maiden that attended on her Grace, By them demaunded how the Princesse did; A reuerend feare brought palenesse to her face, And in her heart she was astonished, And with a fearefull voice deliuered This answere; Lords, my Ladie is not well, Please it your Lo: your occasions tell? They answer, No, and with a sterne aspect, Threaten the fearefull spirit of the Maide; Whose spirits from her outward parts were crept, To cheere her heart, with terrour much afraide: And still, when she could get a word, she saide: My Mistris (Lords.) Hir words then stopt with fears, The rest that wanted were supplide with teares. Goe tell thy Mistris (thus they make reply) That we are sent to bring her to the Court; Our haste is great, stay not to aske vs why, Our estimation it doth much import, That dead or liuing she with vs resort. The maide whose heart their very words did breake, Would haue replide, but that she could not speake. But in she runnes with such amazed haste, As those that are transported with their griefe; Close by the Princesse bed herselfe she plac'd, Shiuering she stoode, as doth the Aspine leafe; And oft she would begin, and oft her griefe Drawes backe hir words, that in hir troubled breast, Heaue vp her bodie with their much vnrest. The Princesse when she sees her so dismaide, Raiseth her sickly bodie in her bed; And fearelesse she demaunds her fearefull Maide, How she with griefe became so altered; Its ease (she saith) to haue it vttered: (If for my sake) I pre thee shed no teare, We that are princely minded cannot feare. (As griefe would giue her leaue) the maiden saide, Madame, your Grace is sent for to the Queene. (The Ladie then) Why art thou so afraid? Would God this let of sickenes had not beene: I haue not of long time my Sister seene. And though for much affliction I be sent, My God hath taught me to be patient. Returne againe vnto the Lords, and say, My sickenes is at this time violent; Please it them rest their trauells heere to day, To morrow they their message may present; We to our Prince must be obedient. Pray them to giue deferment to my sorrow, What they giue not to night, thei'l giue to morrow. The Maide, whose duetie was obedience, Hastes to acquaint them with her Ladies pleasure: But rudely they with much vnreuerence, Whose pride would not attend the Princesse leasure, Rush (vndesir'd) where lay this heauenly treasure. Which their presumption so offends her Grace, As she confronts them with an angrie face. (Sirs) you are not aduised what you do, (Thus their abuse stirres vp her princely fire,) That your audacious footings enter so Into our priuate, where we doe retire; Is it Ambition makes you thus aspire? You ill remember what your dueties beene, Nor that my selfe is Sister to your Queene. Is my great Fathers name with you forgot? Or the remembraunce of my princely Brother? There is no graue can make their names to rot, That in their kingly state exceede all other. I haue not giuen my birth vnto another; I tell you true, how e'r we greeued be, We can not tho forget our dignitie. Thus she had said, and then she made a pause, And then begins in milder phrase againe; Say on (she saith) what is your earnest cause? Came you from Court, how doth my Soueraigne? Then she commaunds a seruant to sustaine, Her much infeebled bodie in her bed, Whilst their Commission they haue vttred. They all make answer with a prowd neglect; (Madame) the Queene hath sent vs for your Grace, Of our Commission this is the effect: Then presently you must forsake this place, And goe with vs. Within the Princesse face, One might perceiue, their words thus vttred, To giue her sickely pale, an angry red. (Thus she) Vnto my soueraigne Ladie Queene I yeelde my selfe in all obedience; My God he knowes that I haue faithful beene, And he in heauen records my innocence; I haue not learn'd to hide with faire pretence: For whatsoe'r my Soueraigne shall present, Euen vnto death I am obedient. Surely, this addes vnto my sickenes, paine, That presently I cannot make repaire Vnto the presence of my Soueraigne; So violent my fittes of sickenes are: Yet that I may expresse my duteous care, I will contend with Death, and this disease Ere I offend: so much I loue to please. This onely fauour (it's a little one) That for a day or two I may repose. This sure exceedes not your Commission, Wee'l iourney hard to get the time we lose. (I tell you Sirs,) my heart before me goes. Will you to me this fauour then deriue? They rudely answer in the negatiue. Th'allowance of our time is not so large, Nor we so bold to disobey the Queene; We must be strict to execute the charge, That to vs strictly hath committed beene: For to our care this hard commaund is giuen, That if pale Death should beare your soule away, To bring the bodie where the spirit lay. Must you haue one? Then take them both (she saies) Am I (alas) so great in my offence? (If needes you must) what is't we vse delaies? Would God your haste with one day might dispence. They answer, No. Then beare my body hence; It is in vaine, I thus expend my breath, Mercy liues not in Messengers of death. Yet this aboue all other griefe is highest, That so my soueraigne Sister is offended; Neerest in blood, and to my loue the nighest, To whose protection I am left commended: How is't this loue of Sisters should be ended? Sure I suspect you doe my Sister wrong, She cannot be so cruell as your tongue. How ere it be, my comfort is in heauen, That makes me powrefull to support my griefe; God that is iust, to my iust cause hath giuen Patience, by which the wronged haue reliefe: Among the patient I my selfe am chiefe. (I tell you true) it is of much import, That God will help my sorrowes to support: Thus she had saide, and then she bids, Prepare To satisfie th'important Messengers: Who on the morrow all prepared were, And all set forward with their busie cares, Their haste their euill diligence declares: For all their haste was but to haste her death, Whom God would giue a manie yeeres of breath. To tell her weary iourney to the Court, Her sicknesse, and their much discourtesie; The few of friends that to her Grace resort, The many griefes, and much aduersitie, That had bedim'd her late prosperitie: To tell you all I should but tell too much, Such was this Ladie, and their vsage such. Being arriu'd at Court, her entertaine Sorted the rest of her affliction: She in a priuate chamber did remaine, Barr'd from the free accesse of any one; And (but for God and Angels) she alone. (Good Lady) in her priuate spent her prayre, Whilst Steuen and others in contriuing were. Vnto this Saint the Queene a diuel sent, Who (with some others of the Counsel) came, With suttle speach to sift and circumuent Her innocence. Be it eternall shame To brand with blacke the record of thy name: For as the hownds pursue the flying chace, Thy dogged thoughts, (O Steuen) pursue her Grace. Thus he begins to open his vile breath. (Madame) we come authoriz'd from the Queene; That Queene whome you had destinate for Death, Had not the powre of Gods resistance beene; But he that hath your secret practise seene, Layes open all your treason in the light, Which you haue long concealed from our sight. (Madam) Nay stay, (the grieued Princesse saies) We haue enough to make a large reply; You do not well report vs in your phrase, And for the name of Treason I defie, O that in you should be such iniurie; It ill befits your reuerend place (my Lord) To brand our honour with so foule a word. But for my soueraigne Sister you present, I in my silence will my selfe containe; Onely let this be thought indifferent, That from the word of Treason you refraine. (I tell you true) I must that word disdaine. Then say the rest (my Lords) how vntrue soe'r, I will inforce my patience for to heare. This iust reproofe incenc'd the Prelate more, Kindl'd the fire of Enuy in his flesh: And made him much more bitter than before, Breathing foorth words of much vnworthinesse, Which for they would but grieue me to expresse, I silence them, and tell you of the rest; The least of euills, is of euills best. (Thus he) How e'r you smoothe with faire pretence, And hide your guilt with resolute deniall; The eie of Iudgement can discerne offence; Nor want we powre to bring you to a triall, We haue Intelligence for our espiall: And when you thought all was in priuate kept, The eie of State did wake, you thought t'had slept. Courtney, and you did not conspire in one? (You thinke we know not that you did conspire) To stirre the people to rebellion, Whereby you might vnto the Crowne aspire; And to that end breath'd your ambitious fire In Wyats breast, that he by his attempt, Might make a way for your new gouernement. Which if you should aspire (which God forbid) How would these kingdomes ruine in your rise? Religion would in banishment be hid, And Luther then must be in exercise. Do not you thus within your heart deuise? I know you do; for how should you be other, Being deriued from so bad a mother? (Madam) you haue too much your Fathers blood, And much too much his blinde opinion. Thinke you your Father did his kingdomes good, To set himselfe in opposition, Against the Church, and true religion? (Though Gyantlike) he fought with little oddes, To raise seditious warre against the gods. Such as was he, such your deceiued brother; Treading the path his father went before. And you (if that you might) would be another, To make the holy Church to suffer more. But God, whose hand hath cur'd what they made sore, Hath giuen Religion and the State a friend, Whose hopes cutte off the euilles you intend. Religious Marie, whose obedience Vnto the holy Seate of Peters chaire, Receiues from heauen such large beneuolence, As if Religion and the Kingdomes were By prouidence committed to her care: It is in vaine you then with her contend, Whome God and holy Angels will defend. (Bishop) I record heauen you doe me wrong, (The Princesse saide) I haue no such intent; My heart hath not resemblance with your tongue, Nor do I hate my Sisters gouerment: My God he knowes that I am innocent. If for my Conscience thus you do enuie, I for my Conscience am content to die. She would haue said much more, but that the Lords, (To haste the execution of their care) Doe interrupt the passage of her words, Adding more griefe to them that grieued were, Telling her Grace, she must her selfe prepare; For that the Queene gaue strict commandement, that Shee to the Towre. The Towre (alas) for what? (So she made hastie answer, and then wept; And then begins in grieued words againe.) What neede a woman in the Towre be kept? I in a lesser prison may remaine: Alas my Sister, and my Soueraigne. How should these wrongs of me be vnderstood, That thus receiue them from my neerest blood? Recall your euill words, and say not so, Do not a seely woman so confound: Vnto the Towre not but offenders goe; If then offence within my life be found, Then (like a Traytor) let me enter bound: If not, intreate my Sister that I die, Rather than Traitor-like in prison lie. The Lords made answer, that it could not be, So much the Queene was mooued to offence, As she would not reuerse that her decree, Nor durst they stand with her in difference: And then they counsaile her to patience; And to the mercy of the Queene submit, Who (for submission) would most fauour it. Thus they had said; and then they left the place, And in the place left many cares behind: All which (like Robbers) did assaile her Grace, And breake the treasure of her quiet minde; So much of griefe in one I cannot find: And (sure) if God should not supply to such, No woman in the world could beare so much. (Although I would) I cannot make report, How much this Ladie is in her distresse; Nor how by prayer she maketh her resort, Vnto the presence of Gods holinesse: Neither can I in liuely formes expresse, How God takes vp her holy praire to heauen, And all the griefe that to her Grace was giuen. Nor can I tell you all their busie care, That had begirt her lodging round about: How manie numbers in their Armors were, Nor how in manhood they were resolute: What watch and warde, what running in and out: Nor how in warlike sort they doe prepare, Against a Ladie that intends but praire. The night thus spent, the next succeeding day, Brought to this Ladie new supply of wrong; The Queene hath sent to bid her haste away, Her stay made people in great numbers throng Vnto the Court. The Towre (she saith) is strong: And though the people in her fauour rise, Yet being there, she can vs not surprise. The Messengers that brought this hard command, Saide that a Barge did for her Grace attend; And that, nor Time, nor Tide would euer stand, And therefore did desire she would not spend The Time that made the Tide to be their friend. The Princesse (with a grieued smile) replide, I am not friended with your forward Tide. Will you but length my time a little more, And stay the fortunes of another Tide: God may in little Time my selfe restore, And fauour whome the Times indignifide; Will you my Lords? The Lords then thus replide: Madame, we are but seruants to the State, Seruants must euer on their Maisters wait. Is there no mercie? Then be strong my heart, To beare the sorrowes of a wearie breath; I haue a God, that will from heauen impart Patience, that makes vs ioyous in our death; My God, be such to thy Elizabeth. Sich that the Queene all mercie doth denie, I to the King of heauen for mercie flie. Yet will I with my duteous care attempt, To purchase fauour from my Sisters eie; For by my Letters to my Soueraigne sent, Her gratious acceptation I shal trie: (Saue but the Lord of Sussex) all denie, To beare the written message she would send, So much they feare the Bishop to offend. This noble Lord (the heauens record his name,) Kneeld with an humble reuerence to her Grace; Swearing, he would his honour first disclame, And lose the reputation of great place, Ere he would so denie her princely Grace. If so (he saith) your princely griefe be writ, Ile pawne my honour to deliuer it. (See here the diffrence in the mighty ones, The Chancelor Steuen, whose place was eminent, Had not as Sussex had, these motions: For why, his birth from basenesse had discent: But Sussex is in honour different. For when that honour is deriu'd in blood, That honour makes the honourable good.) The Ladie glad she had a meanes to send, Raiseth him from the seruice of his knee; And she in teares his honour did commend, That hath respect to her extremitie. And then she craues alittle libertie, That to hir Soueraigne Sister she may write. Griefe hath a tongue, but cannot well indite. My Soueraigne and my Sister (thus she saith) I haue no griefe but that your Grace is grieu'd, And that you haue suspition of my faith, And that I am not of your Grace beleeu'd, (Alas) who hath my treasure thus bereeu'd; Please it your Grace my innocence to trie, If I be guiltie, let the guiltie die. This letter did this faithfull Lord present Vnto the Queene: but yet with such successe, As still she is to her maleuolent. Steuen had resolu'd her in her bloodinesse, She therefore blames the Earles forwardnesse, That he would thus expend his industrie, In fauour of her greatest enemie. Away (shee saith) conuey her to the Towre, Is our commaund so little of respect? We will not you deferre it off an houre, You do dis-honour vs in your neglect: We tell you Sussex, she had neede be kept, And kept secure, whose pride makes her aspire To reach her state aboue our selfe much higher. The Earle thus ill fortun'd in his hope, Would not reply vnto the Queenes offence, Lest he against himselfe might her prouoke, But backe returnes with his lost diligence, And telles the Princesse how he did commence Her humble sute, and of the Queenes reply, That did all fauour to her Grace denie. (Alas she saies) why do I then contend, To help the euill fortunes I indure? It must be death must giue my sorrowes end, In death I shall my quiet best assure: Death can more happines than I procure. Then to the Towre, sith mercy you deny, It's better once than euer for to die. And on the morrow to the Towre she went, Guarded with bands of manie armed men. The time was in the holy time of Lent, And on the day of holy Sabbaoth, when Religious dueties were performing, then Did Steuen (almost agreeing in the day) Most Iudas like this holy one betray. What should I tell you of the much resort, Of running vulgars that vpon her gaze? Or of the strange constructions of the Court, Nor how the newes the better sort amaze, Nor what the murmure of the people saies: But for to tell the sorrowes in her breast, To tell you that is more than all the rest. What is't her Grace with griefe should teare her mind? Or that the giddie people for her pray: Except in God she can no comfort finde. What, is't the Tide inforce her for to stay? Hulling vpon the riuer where she lay: For when the Tide alittle time had spent, The Tide then seru'd for her imprisonment. Being arriued at the place of woe, They offer to the staires where Traitors land; Her Grace desir'd she might not enter so, Praying the Lords that they would so command. Some doe accord, but others do withstand: And there (as often when it goes by voyce) The worse (and not the better) had the choice. Then with a grieued (yet a princely) grace, She steppes vpon that ill arriuing shore: And here (she saith) now enters in this place, As true a subiect to my Gouernour, As ere this heauy passage went before. And you my Lords, beare witnes what I say, A loyall heart may enter in this way. In these our present fortunes you may reade, The fickle change of all mortallitie; You know (my Lords) how princely we are bred, And now you see our great extreamitie; (Alas) in vs there is no certaintie; For though we be the neerest to the Crowne, A little tricke of Fortune pulles vs downe. When this was saide, she thence was led away, Into the circuite of the inner Court, The way she went was marshal'd in array, A many country swaines in warrelike sort. These warriors that sawe her princely port, Such reuerence in the seely men appeares, Their hands haue wepons, but their eies haue teares. Terrour in euery place presents her eie, And that so much as might exanimate, A heart of well resolued valiancie; Much more a Ladie so vnfortunate, To loose the pleasures of so high estate: For (sure) then Griefe is many doubles more, That comes to one that knew it not before. To see the men of warre to be her garde, The dismall place she was to enter in; The heaps of Ammunition in the yarde, The noyse of fetter'd prisoners from within, To see these markes of warre and prisoning, Were much vnfitting obiects for the sight, Ladies (not loue) but feare to be in the fight. The numbers of her griefe do so oppresse, The much infeebled bodie of her Grace, As she sits downe with her much wearinesse, And on a stone she makes her resting place; Who (though the clowds did fall vpon her face) Lifts vp her hands vnto the weeping skie, That onely mournes for her extremitie. (And thus she said) O thou eternall eie, That sees the very secrets of my hart: I doe report me to thy Maiestie, That I am not so foule in my desert, Thou art my comfort, and my Iudge thou art. Sith heere on earth no iustice will be giuen, I for my iustice will resort to heauen. This humble place (my Lords) you enuie not, Enuy shootes not at any one so lowe: The winde beates most vpon the Cedar top, And neuer mooues the vndergrowth below; They stand the safest that the lowest grow. And if you still your enuious thoughts will haue, Ere long Ile beare your enuie to my graue. A Gentleman that on her Grace attended, (So deepely did her sorrowes apprehend) As prodigall his teares he then expended; Which when the grieued Ladie did intend, She friendly thus his sorrowes reprehend; Commaund thy eies (I pre thee) to forbeare, Our griefe wil not be medcin'd with a teare. See'st thou (and then she poynted vnto heauen) In yonder spatious Court we haue a friend; He hath our weakenesse his supportment giuen, To him my selfe in prayer I recommend; Vpon his becke the Angells do attend. And when religious griefe bedims our eie, The Angells come to wipe and make them drie. The Constable desires she would make haste Vnto her lodging, for the day grew olde; And saith her Grace is there but meanely plac'd, And that he feares the stone may giue her colde, And many another circumstance he tolde. (Her Grace stoode vp and saide) We do not feare, Sith we must die, it is no matter where. Then was she led into a priuate roome, Farre from the neighborhood of any one; Whereto the Sunne (till now) did neuer come, The lights that were, were little, almost none, A place most fit for tribulation: The doores and windowes all were made so fast, As if that world should for euer last. It is not possible I should relate, How she the powre of sorrow could appease, Nor how with patience she could moderate, The griefe that on her spirits made a sease, She calmes the raging of her troubled seas: For when the storme of sorrow doth arise, She stilles it with her heauenly exercise. Often her Princely spirit would refraine, And checke her griefe, and beare her teares away; Yet would her teares returne to her againe, And Griefe would pull her on her knees to pray, Much like a showre vpon a sunnie day: For though her face be ouerwasht with teares, The bright of her great Maiestie appeares. As thus her Griefe vnrested had her Grace, To euery place she casts her searching eie, Fearing some hidden danger in the place: Where in the hangings wrought, she did espie, How Daniell in the Lyons Denne did lie, Which counterfet of griefe she stands to see; Griefe is best pleasd with like societie. The worke did well expresse the workemans Arte; For that which should haue life did seeme to haue it: He could no more then seeming life imparte, And that was done so well as Arte could haue it, So exquisite the lustre that he gaue it. The Artist had so much of Arte in giuing, As she did feare the Lions had beene liuing. In midst of them sate Daniel at his praire, His eies, his heart, and hands he lifts to heauen: His armed garde, the kingly Lyons were, And vnto him were many Angells giuen: Some do restraine the Lions that are keene, Others vpon his breath attending are, To carry vp the message of his praire. Nor in this holy storie was forgot, How Abacuc was carried from his men: Nor how the Angell set him on the top, Nor how he call'd to Daniel in the Den: But (sure) some wit was in the workeman, when He makes the Angell beare him by the haire; Yet makes his head be bald, and almost bare. The Princesse on this obiect spends her sight, And freely spends it with intentiue eie: The grieued doe in grieued things delight, And this well sorts with her extremitie. Heere is (she saith) a friendly company, We are not then alone, why grieue we thus? For Daniel and the Lyons be with vs. As I, so Daniel was of noble blood, Both I, and Daniel haue like holy cause; As I my selfe, so Daniel hath withstood To yeelde obedience vnto wicked Lawes; Daniel and I are enuied both, because We giue that honour to the King of heauen, Which others vnto Images haue giuen. God sends his Angells to this holy man, And bindes the force of Lions for his sake; If God restraine, what enuie is there than, That can from any any little take? The eie of prouidence doth euer wake. Then sith that we so like to Daniel are, God will as well for vs as Daniel care. I am (alas) into this prison cast, And (God he knowes) without deseruing cause; And I among such Lions now am plac'd, As watch to seaze my body in their pawes; Lorde binde the powre of their deuouring lawes. And though among these Lions be a Priest, Yet being bloudie, he is a bloodie beast. This apprehension of anothers griefe, Doth somewhat ease the furie of her owne; And she from Daniel can receiue reliefe, Because to him such fauour God had showne: She knowes that God hath all her sorrowes knowne. And He that could the furious Lions tame, Will fauour her that suffers for his name. Thus (and much better than I can report) Was this good Ladie in her griefe affected; But much vnequall was the care at Court, Where Steuen aud others other cares respected; With them there was no tricke of wit neglected: They vex themselues with ouer studious care, To malice her, so much they enuious were. With their prepared subtilties they came, Vnto the Towre, to sift her innocence; And then the Bishop did the Princesse blame, And imputates hir other mens offence; Saying she caused disobedience: And those that were rebellious in the State, Were onely such as she did animate. Then he a number of their names recited, Their seuerall plottes and euery circumstance; And how her Grace was thought with them vnited, And that from hir the warre had maintenance: He left not aught vnsaide that might aduance His euill drift, which for they were so many, And euill ones, I will not write of any. The Princesse to his many words replide. (Alas) what is't you would afflict vs more? Are not our griefes enough yet multiplide? That still you wrong whom you haue wrong'd before, I haue enough of griefe, what neede I more? And for my answer to your euill tongue, I doe protest (my Lord) you doe me wrong. I neuer had that high aspiring minde, To pull my Sister from her royall throne; In my religion I could neuer finde, Licence or Warrant for rebellion. Rome neuer gaue me dispensation: Nor euer learn'd I in my tuterings, To merite heauen by murthering of Kings. This sharpe reply the Bishop so offended, As he reanswers in a bitter phrase: (Madam,) against the Church you haue contended, And still contend (the angry Prelate saies) This disobedience is your great dispraise: If you betray the Church which is your mother, How can you then be true to any other? How is't your Grace should thus contend with heauen, With God, with Angells, and with holy Saints; How is't that thus to Luther you haue giuen Your soule, which he with blackenesse all depaints, Who is't this heresie with you acquaints? (Alas good Ladie) Luther doth not well, To drawe your Grace and many moe to hell. O giue me leaue alittle to aduise, (I doe not know how fortunate I may,) To leaue the danger of your heresies; Let Luther beare them with himselfe away; Sith you are lost I will direct your way. And will you follow but as I direct, You shall arriue the place of Gods elect. What is the new religion you professe? (Religion saide I, O it is not so) An opposite to antient holinesse; A way that leades to damned ones below: Wherein your wise forefathers would not goe: And those that loue this new begotten lore, Do damne their fathers that haue liu'd before. Rome is not so as your new discipline, Antient in time, and happy in successe; Being assisted with a powre diuine, That giues to it successiue holinesse. Ladie (would God) you had the happinesse, With holy teares to wash away your sin, Rome hath the keyes to open and let in. The Princesse made the Bishop this reply. I am not cunning for to make dispute, I thanke your selfe, but not your Sophistrie, In my religion I am resolute; Yet heere is one your learning can confute: (And then she points whereas her Bible lay,) Here's one (she saith) will teach me what to say. This telles me, that Ambition in a Priest, Is that which God with detestation hateth; That God will giue the couetous the least, And makes, that he vpon the humble waiteth, That with aspiring pride himselfe instateth. And sith that Rome in pride exceedeth all, Assure your selfe, that Rome, and Pride will fall. Christ vnto Cæsar (not a Christian King,) Exemplifies a duetifull respect; But bloodie Rome would to confusion bring, All Empire and command, her selfe except; Her greatnesse is with bloodie practise kept; Vnlike to Peter his successors are, That haue with christian blood distain'd his Chaire. And much she would haue said, but that the Lords Did interrupt the office of her tongue; They say she is too bitter in her words, And therein to her selfe she offers wrong. Steuen saith she is in euill ouer strong. With this their enuions speach they went their way, And she (as was her custome) went to pray. It farre exceedes the powre of any tongue, To tell you all the sorrowes of this place. How both her seruants, and her selfe they wrong, With what neglect and scorne they vse her Grace, What bloodie men about her they did place. Their names I silence, for it is not good, To brand the children with the fathers blood. Nor how she was remooued from the Towre, The country being armed to conuey her To Woodstocke house, where she exspects each howre, The bloodie hand of treason to betray her: So many griefes, so many feares dismay her, As would with griefe my spirits ouercharge, To enter in a sea of griefe so large. What should I speake of Perrie who was sent, To short her life with his base treacherous hand; Or yet of him, who with the like intent, Came to surprise her with an armed band; Or how with fire she did in danger stand. There are both these, and many moe behinde, Whose repetition would but grieue my minde. Yet can it not in my remembrance die, How Spanish Philip did this Ladie friend; That he could pittie her extreamitie, That he his louing fauour did extend, That he would praise, that he her gifts commend: By this we see their malice was but vaine, Mercie will come, although it come from Spaine. So well the Kings perswasion could preuaile, As that the Queene did for her Sister send; The message did with feare her heart assaile, And sure she thinkes some euill they intend; How ere it be (she saith) I recommend Into thy hands, (O sacred Lord of heauen) My selfe, and all that to my selfe is giuen. And thus prepar'd, she iournies to the Court, Where in her chamber prison-like retirde, She liues shut vp from any ones resort. The Bishop that this Ladies bloud desirde, To quench his heart with burning enuy firde; Comes to her furnisht with his studious care, Hoping with craft the Princesse to insnare. Gardner, it is in vaine thou her assaile, Whome God protects with his almightie hand; Canst thou against the liuing God preuaile? Or canst thou his all-able powre withstand? Or canst thou God and holy heauen command? (Bishop be sure) they are deceiued farre That thinke (with God) to make preuailing warre. Therefore thy euill had but bad euent, How ere made strong with thy contriuing wit, Because thy euill to the good was meant, And God would not be pleasd to fauour it; Though earth and hell in busie counsell sit, God countermaunds what ere they deuise, And makes them foolish, that are iudged wise. And Winchester, we instance this in thee, Whose houres in studious care were euer spent, To bring this Ladie her extreamitie: Yet for that God did see thy hearts intent, He blunts thy edge (O bloudie instrument;) And (belows-like) he make thy enuious breath, To make hir liue, thou woldst haue blowne to death. Thus God can mocke the subtilties of men, Letting them runne the passage they propose; Seeming regardlesse, yet regardfull then, His eie their hidden secrets can disclose; For Prouidence in euery passage goes: That howsoere mens pollicies doe plot, They haue had issue if God fauour not. So God was pleasd with prouidence and care, This vertuous holy Lady to defend. To binde their force, and breake their hidden snare, That euill men for euill did intend. And now the Queene doth for her Sister send; Where when she was presented on her knee, She thus protesteth her integrity. (Dread Soueraigne) I your seruant here present My selfe as true vnto your life and state, As is the spirite of an innocent; And so let God my griefe extenuate, As I doe wish you to be fortunate: And let the heauens their benefits denie To all that enuy at your Maiestie. The Queene with angry maiestie then saith, You stand too much vpon your innocence, Too confident in your suspected faith, It would be better to cast off pretence, And plainely to acknowledge your offence. (The Princesse saide) The guiltie should confesse, And so would I, if I had guiltinesse. But God that sees the very secret thought, Knowes in my heart there is no guiltines; That there was neuer any treason wrought, Or any thought of such vnworthines. If then I should against my selfe confesse; I bring my selfe an euerlasting shame, To brand the reputation of my name. O let it please your Princely maiestie, That I your seruant may receiue this grace; That Law it selfe my innocence may trie, That Law may be impartiall in this case: And if that Law doe quit me of disgrace, Then let your seruant haue a gratious eie; If not, let Lawe and Iustice make me die. If you be then so righteous (saith the Queene) Belike you'l say, that we vnrighteous are; And that your troubles haue vnrighteous beene, And so the guilt on vs you doe transferre, And make them righteous that vnrighteous are: And so to make your owne purgation, You lay on vs the imputation. The Ladie then: let not my Soueraigne Haue that construction of my duteous heart; Long may your reputation God maintaine, And much may he inlarge your high desart: And (if I may my secret heart impart) (I do protest) it doth my spirit good, To see such honour in my neerest blood. And for the sorrowes that I doe indure, I know the cause is not your owne desire; But that some other did the hurt procure, And stirr'd your anger with their enuious fire; Against your Grace and me, they doe conspire, That would the neerenesse of our loue diuide, Whome God and Nature haue so neerely tide. Nature (euen in the Queene) was powrefull strong. And makes her spirit haue a feeling sense; And now she thinkes her Sister hath had wrong, And in her heart she blames their diligence, That causlesse thus did cause this great offence: (And to her selfe she saith) I doe offend, Are we not Sisters? why should we contend? Yet would she not expresse her inward heart, Nor then giue demonstration of her loue; Nor did she then to any one impart, What she in her intention did approue: But (sure) she had a purpose to remoue The fire of indignation from her breast, Which Steuen had kindl'd with so much vnrest. The sequele did approue the good intent; For now the beames of mercie doe appeare, The Queene doth free her long imprisonment, Remoues her Gailer whome she most did feare, And now she giues her licence to repaire Vnto her home; where when she did arriue, A peacefull quiet doth her griefe depriue. Now I haue runne the passage I intended, (I do not know how fortunate I runne;) My verse is done now that her griefe is ended. And she at rest, my busie care is done; The cloudes do vanish that bedimm'd this Sunne. And God that in her sorrowes did protect her, Now in her rise he labours to erect her. Gardner (the worst of all her enemies) The heauens cut short his ill-attempting breath, And made him perish with his subtilties: But when that Time had giu'n Queene Mary death, The heauens then smiled on Elizabeth. And now those great ones that enui'd hir Grace, Haue left to her the greatnesse of their place. Where (like the Sunne) she was most glorious bright, Casting her beames of mercie euery where; And euery where she giues a glorious light; All other lights to her but little were; So matchlesse was she, and so wondrous rare, As for to verse her glories I refuse, Leauing that Labour for a better Muse. I neuer toucht Parnassus with my sight; Nor did the Muses euer teach me rhyme, Only in humble verse I take delight: Nor doe I loue the higher straines to clime; This plainenesse makes me t'vnfit the time: But if that Arte vnto my verse were giuen, She then should liue in verse, that liue's in heauen.
