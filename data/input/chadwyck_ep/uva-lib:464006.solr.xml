      <field name="fulltext">I. MY MYNDE TO ME A KINGDOME IS. 1 My mynde to me a kyngdome is; Such preasente joyes therein I fynde, That it excells all other blisse That earth affords or growes by kynde: Thoughe muche I wante which moste would have Yet still my mynde forbiddes to crave. 2 No princely pompe, no wealthy store, No force to winne the victorye, No wilye wit to salve a sore, No shape to feede a lovinge eye; To none of these I yielde as thrall: For why? My mynde doth serve for all. 3 I see how plenty suffers ofte, And hasty clymers sone do fall; I see that those which are alofte, Mishapp doth threaten moste of all; They get with toyle, they keepe with feare: Suche cares my mynde could never beare. 4 Content I live, this is my staye, I seeke no more than maye suffyse; I presse to beare no haughty swaye; Look what I lack, my mynde supplies: Lo, thus I triumph like a kynge, Content with that my mynde doth bringe. 5 Some have too muche, yet still do crave; I little have, and seek no more. They are but poore though muche they have, And I am ryche with lyttle store; They poore, I ryche; they begge, I gyve; They lacke, I leave; they pyne, I lyve. 6 I laughe not at another's losse, I grudge not at another's gayne; No worldly waues my mynde can toss: My state at one dothe still remayne: I feare no foe, I fawn no friende; I loathe not lyfe nor dread my ende. 7 Some weighe their pleasure by theyre luste, Theyre wisdom by theyre rage of wyll; Theyre treasure is theyre onlye truste, A clokèd crafte theyre store of skylle. But all the pleasure that I fynde Is to mayntayne a quiet mynde. 8 My wealthe is healthe and perfect ease; My conscience cleere my choice defence; I neither seeke by brybes to please Nor by deceyte to breede offence; Thus do I lyve, thus will I dye; Would all did so well as I. Finis. E. Dier. II. A FANCY. 1 Hee that his mirth hath loste, Whose comfort is dismaid, Whose hope is vaine, whose faith is scornd, Whose trust is all betraid, 2 If hee have held them deare, And cannot cease to moane, Come, let him take his place by mee; He shall not rue alone. 3 But if the smalest sweete Be mixt with all his sowre; If in the day, the moneth, the yeare, He finde one lightsome hower, 4 Then rest hee by himself; He is noe mate for mee, Whose hope is falen, whose succor voyde, Whose hart his death must be. 5 Yet not the wishèd death, That hathe noe plainte nor lacke, Which, making free the better parte, Is onely nature's sacke. 6 Oh mee! that wer too well, My death is of the minde, Which alwaies yeeldès extreame paines, Yet keepes the worst behind. 7 As one that lives in shewe But inwardly doth dye, Whose knowledge is a bloody field Wheare all hope slaine doth lie; 8 Whose harte the aulter is, Whose spirit, the sacrifize Vnto the Powers whome to appease Noe sorrowes can sufize. 9 Whose fancies are like thornes, On which I goe by night, Whose arguments are like a hoste, That force hath put to flight. 10 Whose sense is passion's spye, Whose thoughtes, like ruins old Of Carthage, or the famous towne That Sinon bought and sold. 11 Which still before my face, My mortall foe doth lay, Whome love and fortune once advanced And nowe hath cast away. 12 O thoughtes! noe thoughtes but woundes, Sometimes the seate of Joy Sometymes the chaire of quiet rest But nowe of all annoy. 13 I sowed the feild of peace, My blisse was in the Springe; And day by day I ate the fruit That my Live's tree did bring. 14 To nettels nowe my corne, My feild is turnd to flint, Where sitting in the cipres shade, I reade the hiacint. 15 The ioy, the rest, the life That I enioyed of yore Came to my lot that by my losse, My smarte might smarte the more. 16 Thus to vnhappie men The best frames to the worste; O tyme, O places. O woordes, O lookes, Deere then but nowe accurst! 17 In ‘was’ stood my delight, In ‘is’ and ‘shall’ my woe; My horrors fastned in the ‘yea,’ My hope hangs in the ‘noe.’ 18 I looke for noe delight, Releefe will come too late; Too late I finde, I finde too well, Too well stoode my Estate. 19 Behold, heere is the end, And nothing heere is sure: Ah nothinge ells but plaints and cares Doth to the world enduer. 20 Forsaken first was I, Then vtterly foregotten; And he that came not to my faith, Lo! my reward hath gotten. 21 Nowe Love, where are thy lawes That make thy torments sweete? What is the cause that some through thee Have thought their death but meet? 22 Thy stately chaste disdaine, Thy secret thanckfulnes, Thy grace reservd, thy common light That shines in worthines. 23 O that it were not soe Or that I could excuse! O that the wrath of Jelousie My judgement might abuse! 24 O fraile vnconstant kynd, And safe in truste to noe man! Noe woemen angells are, yet loe! My mistris is a woeman! 25 Yet hate I but the falte, And not the faultie one; Nor can I rid me of the bonds Wherein I lye alone. 26 Alone I lye, whose like By loue was never yet; Nor rich, nor poore, nor younge, nor old, Nor fond, nor full of witt. 27 Hers still remaine must I, By wronge, by death, by shame; I cannot blot out of my minde That loue wrought in her name. 28 I cannot set at naught That I have held soe deare, I cannot make it seem so farre That is indeede soe neare. 29 Nor that I meane, henceforth This strange will to professe: I never will betray such trust And fall to ficklenesse. 30 Nor shall it euer faile That my word bare in hand: I gaue my word, my worde gaue me, Both worde and gaift shall stand. 31 Syth then it must be thus And this is all to ill, I yeelde me captiue to my curse, My harde fate to fulfill. 32 The solitarie woodes, My Cittie shall become; The darkest den shalbe my lodge Whereto noe light shall come. 33 Of heban blacke my boorde; The wormes my meate shalbe, Wherewith my carcase shalbe fed Till thes doe feede on mee. 34 My wine, of Niobe, My bed the cragie rocke, My harmony, the serpent's hisse, The shreikinge owle, my cocke. 35 Mine exercise naught ells But raginge agonies; My bookes, of spightfull fortune's foiles And drerye tragedies. 36 My walkes the pathes of plaint, My prospect into Hell, With Sisiphus and all his pheres In endles paines to dwell. 37 And though I seeme to vse The poet's fainèd stile, To figure forth my wofull plight, My fall and my exile. 38 Yet is my greeffe not faind, Wherein I starve and pine, Whoe feeleth most shall finde it least Comparinge his with mine. 39 My songe,—if anie aske Whose grievous case is such? Dy er thou let'st his name be knowne,— His follye showes too much. 40 But best, were thee to hide And never come to light; For in the worle can none but thee These accents sound aright. 41 And soe a end: my tale is tould: His life is but disdaind, Whose sorrowes present paine him soe, His pleasures are full faind. Finis. Sr Ed. Dyer. III. THE MAN OF WOE. The mann whose thoughtes agaynste him do conspyre, One whom Mishapp her storye dothe depaynt, The mann of woe, the matter of desier, Free of the dead, that liues in endles plaint, His spirit am I, whiche in this deserte lye, To rue his case, whose cause I cannot flye. Despayre my name, whoe neuer findes releife, Frended of none, but to my selfe a foe; An idle care, mayntaynde by firme beleife That prayse of faythe shall throughe my torments growe, And counte those hopes, that others hartes do ease, Butt base conceites the common sense to please. For sure I am I neuer shall attayne The happy good from whence my ioys aryse; Nor haue I powre my sorrows to refrayne But wayle the wante, when noughte ellse maye suffyse; Whereby my lyfe the shape of deathe muste beare, That deathe which feeles the worst that lyfe doth feare. But what auayles withe tragicall complaynte, Not hopinge healpe, the Furyes to awake? Or why shoulde I the happy mynds aquaynte With doleful tunnes, theire settled peace to shake? All ye that here behoulde Infortune's feare, May iudge noe woe may withe my gref compare. Finis. Mr. Dier. IV. THE SHEPHERD'S CONCEIT OF PROMETHEUS. Prometheus when firste frome heauen hye He broughte downe fyre, 'ere then on earthe not seene, Fond of Delight, a Satyre standing bye Gaue it a kyss, as it lyke Sweete had bene. Feelinge forthewithe the other's burninge powre, Wood withe the smarte, with shoutes and shreakinge shrill, He soughte his ease in riuer, feilde and bowre, But for the tyme his griefe wente with him still. So seelye I, with that vnwonted syghte In humane shape, an angell from aboue, Feedinge mine eyes, th'impressione there did lyghte, That since I reste and runn as pleaseth Loue. The difference is, the Satyre's lypps, my harte,— He for a tyme, I euermore,—haue smarte. Finis. Mr. Dier. A REPLY. BY Sir Philip Sidney. A Satyre once did runn awaye for dreade, Of sound of horne which he himselfe did blowe; Fearinge and fearde, thus from himselfe he fledd, Deeming strange euill in that he did not know. Suche causeles feares when cowardes' mynds do take, It makes them flye that which they fayne would haue; As this poore beaste that did his rest forsake, Seekinge not why, but how, himselfe to saue. Euen so myghte I, for doubte which I conceyue Of myne own faith, myne owne good hope betraye; And so myghte I, for fear of may be, leaue The sweet persute of my desyrèd praye. Better be lyke thy Satyr derest Dier That burnt his lipps to kiss fayr shininge fyre. V. CORIDON TO HIS PHILLIS. Alas my hart, mine eye hath wrongèd thee, Presumptious eye, to gaze on Phillis face: Whose heavenly eye no mortall man may see But he must die, or purchase Phillis grace. Poor Coridon, the Nimph whose eye doth mooue thee, Dooth loue to draw, but is not drawne to loue thee. Her beautie, Nature's pride, and sheepheards praise, Her eye, the heauenly Planet of my life: Her matchlesse wit and grace, her fame displaies, As if that Joue had made her for his wife. Onely, her eyes shoote fierie darts to kill, Yet is her hart as cold as Caucase hill. My wings too weake to flye against the Sunne, Mine eyes vnable to sustaine her light, My hart doth yeeld that I am quite vndone, Thus hath faire Phillis slaine me with her sight. My bud is blasted, withred is my leafe And all my corne is rotted in the sheafe. Phillis, the golden fetter of my minde, My fancie's Idoll, and my vitall power: Goddesse of Nimphs, and honour of thy kinde, This Age's Phœnix, Beautie's richest bower. Poore Coridon for loue of thee must die: Thy beautie's thrall and conquest of thine eye. Leaue Coridon to plough the barren field, Thy buds of hope are blasted with disgrace: For Phillis' lookes no harty loue doo yeeld, Nor can she loue, for all her louely face. Die Coridon, the spoile of Phillis' eye: She cannot loue, and therefore thou must die. Finis. S. E. Dyer. VI. TO PHILLIS THE FAIRE SHEEPHEARDESSE.The attribution of this poem is questionable. My Phillis hath the morninge Sunne, at first to looke vpon her: And Phillis hath morne-waking birds, her risinge still to honour. My Phillis hath prime-featherd flowres, that smile when she treads on them: And Phillis hath a gallant flocke, that leapes since she dooth owne them. But Phillis hath too hard a hart, alas, that she should haue it: It yeelds no mercie to desert, nor grace to those that craue it. Sweete Sunne, when thou look'st on, pray her regard my moane! Sweete birds, when you sing to her, to yeeld some pitty, woo her! Sweet flowers that she treads on, tell her, her beauty deads one. And if in life her loue she nill agree me, Pray her before I die, she will come see me. Finis. S. E. D. VII. THE FAIR AMARILLIS. 1 Amarillis was full fayre: The goodlyest mayde was she From the east vnto the west That heauen's eye could se. 2 To Diana at her birthe Her parents did her geue, All vntouchte a mayden's lyfe Durynge her dayes to lyue: 3 Whose beheste she constant kepte And whollye was enclynde To be free to get great prayse And win eche worthye mynde. 4 As there was good cause enoughe So was she honored most. They that had her seene abroade Att home would make their boaste. 5 Twoe ther were that her behelde Who woulde haue done so euer, Happye theye (ye happye thryse) If they had done so neuer 6 Coridon and Caramell: Who longe with deere accorde Ledd their lyues, and neyther wisht Of other to be lorde: 7 Good and sure their freendshipp was Tyll Amaryllis fyne Had the powre, perhapps the will The bande for to vntwyne: 8 All the goods that eche possest Of bodye, goodes, or mynde Were employde to other's vse As eche by profe did fynde: 9 They had no cause to enuye ought The auncyent worlde's prayse Of Dam? and of Pytheas And others in those dayes: 10 But the boye, that blynded god In great despights complaynde: That one earthe alone they were That his darte quyte disdaynde: 11 Whereupon his strongest bowe And sharpest arrowes hente And in Amarillis eyes He lyghtely pighte his tente: 12 Where he lay, to watche both tyme And place for his auayll: For the wightes that wiste not yet What foe should them assayll: 13 One of his two shafts was dipte In bitter sauce as gaulle, The other in a pleasant wyne And poyson myxte withall 14 As the smacke of dyuers sauce, So dyuerslye they wroughte: By despayre the one to deathe By vague hope the other broughte. 15 With the first was Coridon Throughe piercèd to the herte; Caramell w?' in his brest Felte of the other's smarte. 16 Butt with gould both headed were And both w?? lyke desyre, Faygne they would w??'in therre brest Hyde cloase their kyndled fyre: 17 But w??out it must appeere That burnte so hot w??in: Harde it is the flame to hyde That it no issue win. 18 And in tyme strange lookes began That spronge of Jelosye; Full of care, eche laye in wayghte For his felowe to descrye: 19 In the end all freendly lookes Betweene these freendes decayde; Bothe were bente to please th?selues Theire freende's case nothynge wayde. 20 Amaryllis' loue was soughte With all they could deuyse, Yea w?? all the power of man And prayer to the skyes: 21 All she sawe, and herde theire moane As Aspis dothe the charme; By and by she bayed them both As guyltye of theyre harme. 22 Now to the one she would giue eare Now put the other of, Allurynge him by courteseye, And tauntynge him by scoff. 23 But that trust by tryalls paste Made them theire doome suspende; And indeed she vsèd there Where passione did offend. 24 He had neede of store of tyme That would his pen prepare, To sett forth theire agonyes Theire dredd hope and feare. 25 Butt in vayne they spente theire tyme, Theire labor all was lost: She was farthest from theire need Where they foreweenèd most. 26 Coridon waxte pall and leane His younger heares torned hore; Feates of armes, the horse and hauke He left and vsed no more. 27 He had founde that Amaryll Soughte glorye more than loue; That she forcèd not his harmes Her bewtye's power to proue. 28 Yet he could not leaue to loue Butt yeeldynge to despayre, Rente his hearte, his corpes fell downe His goaste fledd to the ayre: 29 Caramell, thoughte women kynde, Was apte to change and bowe; And beleeued, to please him selfe What fancye did allowe. 30 Butt beleefe ne makes the cause Nor weauynge, workes the webb; In the tyde his trauayll came He tornèd in the ebb: 31 Att the last his vayne hope, him No longer coulde sustayne; In his longynge he consumde, Lyfe coulde not him attayne. 32 Amaryllis herde of this And pyttye moude w?? all, Muche to rue so harde a happ One such faythe should befall. 33 To Diana strayghte she hyghes Whome wayted one she founde, With a trayne of all the dames Whose chaste names Fame did sounde: 34 Vnto her in humble wyse She sayde she came to sue For that these to lyuyng thynges Myghte be transformde a newe; 35 In her armes the goddess mylde Her darlynge softe did strayne: What is that that thou (q?? she) Of me mayste not obtayne? 36 There withall S? Caramel A yellow flowre became: Sweete of sente and muche esteemde And Harte's ease caulde by name. 37 Amarillis pluckte the flowre And ware it in her heade: Sometymes she layde it in her lapp, Sometymes vpone her bedd. 38 Caramell, O happye flowre! O most vnhappy man! In thy lyfe thou hadst thy deathe, In thy deathe thy lyfe began. 39 Coridon turnde to an owlle Fledd to the wildernes: Neuer flockes, butt leades his lyfe In solytarynes: 40 Nor his eyes can yet behould The deare lyghte of the sun: Butt aloofe he stealles his flyghte And in the darke dothe run. 41 Amaryllis to the woode Att sometyme will repayre, And delyghte to here the laye And tune of his despayre. 42 Well I wot what here is ment And thoughe a talle y? seeme, Shadowes haue their substance bye And so of this, esteeme. 43 Ye that chaunce this for to heer And do not prayse their speede Giue them thankes, for you by them Are warnde to take heede. Finis. E. Dier. VIII. LOVE-CONTRADICTIONS. As rare to heare as seldome to be seene, It cannot be nor neuer yet hathe bene That fire should burne w?? perfecte heate and flame Without some matter for to yealde the same. A straunger case yet true by profe I knowe A man in ioy that liuethe still in woe: A harder happ who hathe his loue at lyste Yet liues in loue as he all loue had miste: Whoe hathe enougehe, yet thinkes he liues w??out, Lackinge no loue yet still he standes in doubte. What discontente to liue in suche desyre, To have his will yet euer to requyre. Mr. Dier. IX. LOVE-DESPONDENCY. Deuyde my tymes and rate my wretched howres From days to months, fr? months to many yeers, And than compare my sweetest to my sowres then And see w?? more in equall vewe appeares; And iudge that from my dayes and yeers of care I haue but howrs of comforte to compare. Just and not muche it were, in thes extreams To haue a touche and torment of y? thought: For any myghte that any ryght esteems To yealde so small delyght so deerly bought; But he that lyues vnto his owne despyghte Is not to fynde his fortune by his ryghte. The lyfe that styll runs forth his weary wayes With sowre to sawce the dayntyes of delyght, And care to choak the pleasures of his dayes And not regarde the many wronges to quyte; No blame to houlde such ircksome tymes in hate, As but to lose prolongs a wretched state. And still I loathe eu? to behoulde the lyghte That shynes w??out all pleasure to myne eyes W?? greedy wishe I wayte for wearye nyghte Yet neither this I fynde that maye suffyse: Not that I hould the daye for more delyghte But that alyke I loathe both daye and nyghte. The daye I se yeelds but increase of cares, The nyght that should by nature serue for reste, Agaynst his kynde denyes suche ease to spare As pytty woulde afforde the soule opprest: And broken sleeps oft tymes presents in syght A dreaminge wishe beguylde w?? false delyghte. This sleepe, or else what so for sweet appeers, Is vnto me but pleasures in despyghte. The flower of age, the name of younger yeeres, Do but vsurpe the tytle of delyghte. But careful thoughts, and Sorrowe sundry ways Consumes my youthe before my agèd dayes. The touch, the stynge, the torments of desyre, To stryue beyond the compase of restraynte, Kepte from the reache whereto it would aspyre Geues cause (God knowes) too iust, to my c?plainte: Besydes the wronge w?? worketh my distress My meaninge is, with sylence to suppress. Oft w?? myselfe I enter in deuyse To reconsylle these wearye thoughtes to peace; I treate for truce, I flatter and entyce My wranglynge wytts to work for theyr release; But all in vayne I seek the means to fynde That myght appease the discorde of my mynde. For when I force a faynèd mirth to showe And would forgett and so beguyll my greefe; I cannot rydd my selfe of sorrowe so, Althoughe I feed vpon a false beleefe: For inward touche of discontented mynde Retournes my cares by course vnto theyr kynde. Wean'd from my will, and thus by tryall taughte Howe farr to hould all fortune in regarde; Though here I boaste of knowledge deerely boughte Yet thys poore gayne I reape for my rewarde; I knowe hereby to hard? and prepare A ready mynde for all assaults of care. Whereto as one eu? from the cradle borne And not to look for better to ensue, I yeald my selfe and wish these tymes outworne That but remayne my torments to renewe: And leaue to those these dayes of my despyghte Whose better hap may lyue to more delyghte. Finis. Mr. Dier. X. I WOULD AND I WOULD NOT. I woulde it were not as it is Or that I cared not yea or no; I woulde I thoughte it not amiss, Or that amiss myghte blamles goo; I woulde I were, yet woulde I not, I myghte be gladd yet coulde I not. I coulde desyre to know the meane Or that the meane desyre soughte; I woulde I coulde my fancye weane From suche sweet ioyes as Loue hathe wroughte; Onlye my wishe is leaste of all A badge whereby to know a thrall. O happy man whiche doste aspire To that whiche semeleye thou dost craue! Thrise happy man, if thy desyre Maye winn with hope good happ to haue; But woe to me vnhappy man Whom hope nor happ acquiet cann. The budds of hope are starude w?? feare And still his foe presents his face; My state, if hope the palme shoulde beare Vnto my happ woulde be disgrace. As diamond in woode were set Or Irus raggs in goulde I frett. For loe my tyrèd shoulders beare Desyre's weery beatinge winges; And at my feet a clogg I weare Tyde one w?? selfe disdayning stringes. My wings to mounte aloft make hast. My clog doth sinke me downe as faste. This is our state, loe thus we stande They ryse to fall that climbe to hye; The boye that fled kynge Minos lande Maye learne the wise more lowe to flye. What gaynde his poynte agaynste the sonne He drownde in seas himself, that wonne. Yet Icarus more happy was, By present deathe his cares to ende Than I, pore mann, on whom alas Tenn thousande deathes theire paynes do sende. Now greife, now hope, now loue, now spyghte Longe sorrows mixte withe shorte delyghte. The pheere and fellowe of thy smarte Prometheus I am indeede; Vpon whose euer liuinge harte The greedy gryphes do daylye feede; But he that lyfts his harte so hye Muste be contente to pine and dye. Finis. Mr. Dier. XI. A LADY FORSAKEN, COMPLAYNETH.The attribution of this poem is questionable. If pleasures be in painefulnesse, in pleasures doth my body rest, If ioyes accord with carefulnesse, a joyful hart is in my brest: If prison strong be libertie, in libertie long haue I been, If ioyes accord with miserie, who can compare a lyfe to myne: Who can vnbind that is sore bound? who can make free y? is sore thrall, Or how can any meanes be found to comfort such a wretch withall? None can but he y? hath my hart, conuert my paines to comfort then, Yet since his seruant I became, most like a bondman haue I beene: Since first in bondage I became, my woord and deede was euer such, That neuer once he could [m]e blame, except for louing him too much. Which I can iudge no iust offence, nor cause that I deserud disdayne, Except he meane through false pret?ce, through forgèd loue to make a trayne. Nay, nay, alas, my fainèd thoughts my fr?ded and my fainèd ruth, My pleasures past, my present plaints, shew well I meane but to much truth: But since I can not him attaine, against my wil I let him goe, And lest he glorie at my paine, I wyl attempt to cloke my woe. Youth learne by me but do not proue, for I haue prouèd to my paine, What greeuous greefes do grow by loue, and what it is to loue in vaine. M. D. XII. CYNTHIA OR FAIR AND FAITHLESS. Amidst the fayrest mountayne topps, Where Zepherus doth breathe The pleasant gale, that clothes with flowres The valleys underneath; A shepparde liude, that dearly loude; Deare Loue, tyme brought to passe A fforest nimphe, who was as fayre As euer woman was. His thoughtes were higher then the hills Whereof he had the keepe, But all his actions innocent, As humble as his sheep: Yet had he powre, but her pure thoughts Debar'd his powers to rise Higher then, kissinge of her handes, Or lookinge in her eyes, One day, (I neede not name the daye To loouers of their sorrows, But say, as once a shepparde sayd, Their mone nights haue no morrows) He from his sheep-cot ledd his sheepe To pasture in the lease, And ther to feed while he, the while, Might dream of his disease. And all alone (if he remayne Alone, that is in loue,) Vnto himselfe alone, he mourn'd The passions he did proue. Oh heauens! (quoth he) ar these th'effects Of faithfull loue's desarts? Will Cynthea now forsake my loue? Haue women faithless hearts? And will not witts, nor woords, nor woorks, Nor long-endur'd laments, Bring to my playnts, pitie or peace; Or to my teares, contents? I, that enchayn'd my loue desires, From changinge thoughts as free, As euer was true thoughts to her, Or her thoughts false to me. I that for her my wanderinge sheepe, Forsook, forgott, forwent; Nor of my selfe, nor them tooke keepe, But in her loue's content. Shall I, like meads with winter's rayne Be turnèd into teares, Shall I, of whose true feelinge payne, These greeues the record beares; Causeles, be scorn'd, disdayn'd, despis'd? Then witnes this desire; Loue was a woman's weed disguisde, And not in men's attire. And thus he said, and downe he lies, Syinge as life would part. Oh, Cynthia, thou hast angel's eyes, But yet a woman's heart! Mr. Dier. End of Uerse.</field>
