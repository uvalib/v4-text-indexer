      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHTE worshipfull his tried and worthy friend, Maister Christofor Hatton Esquier, Captaine of the Queenes Maiesties Garde, and Gentleman of her highnesse priuie Chamber. To the dispisers of other mens workes that shoes nothing of their owne. If vvell you iudge of my good vvill, you yelde me my desarts: If that vvith frovvns and scorneful locks, you shoe your hollovve harts. (And by disdaine disgrace his Verse, that doth the best he can:) You do not vvell to hinder soe, the works of any man. For loke vvhat measure you doe meet, the same yee shall receaue: VVhen from the loem of your deuice, like vvebb of cloeth you vveaue. But if you leade an idle life, and father near a childe: You are as bad as barain ground, and so the vvorld begilde. The loekar on of table playe, finds many faults in deede: (And vvith conceites of this and that, he doth his fancie feede) But bid him play a gaem himselfe. and than perhaps he will: Mis some good pointe by ouer sight, and loes his money still. A man that builds a prettie house, in svveete and holsome ayre: (VVith goodly rovvms and choise of place, and vvindoes large and fayre.) Shall heer his neighbour streight disprayes, the seate and eek the fraem: Yet hee that praets vvants vvealth and vvit, and cannot mende the seam. VVhat needs more words to waest my wind, about these busie brains: That povvlts and svvels at others toils, and take themselues no pains. The best is though small goodnes be, in these baer chipps of mien: My hatchet hewd them all in deede, vvhear they be grosse or fien. And vvhan that theas haue maed a blaes, and bin in vvorld a whiel: A bigger basket vvill I bring, to make you vvorldlings smiel. And vvheather theas you like or noe, the rest aer neer the stamp: VVhich if you pleas to flinge in fier, vvill borne as cleer as lamp. Thus faerwell frends or flyring foes, I kno not hovv to fawne: I mean to see you ons again, so leaue my booke for pawne. Adue. THE SIEGE OF Leeth, more aptlie called the schole of warre, (the Lord Gray of Wiltton generall thereof) in the second yeare of the raigne of oure soueraigne Lady Queene Elizabeth, Anno. 1560. As Marche did ende, so Mars began his raigne, Whose m? I saw, to bluddy warres were bente From Barwick walls, they marched throw the plaine With banner splaide, with carriage haell and tente, All fitte for warres, to Leeth this armye wente, And as I know, the nomber was so small, Sixe thousande and, fiue hundreth men were all. And most of those, not trayned for the field More rawe then rype, vnready out of vse: And some men say, ech leader was not skild, But what of that: I write not of abuse If faultes there were, I ought to make excuse: First do wee creepe and after learne to go, All hitts not white, that shooteth in the bow, Amonge these men, were souldiours of ech sorte Both old &amp; yonge, what should there more be said? And some that sought, to get a good report To haunt the warres, did holde them well apaid: Of Cannon shotte, they seldome stoode afraid They knew the cracke, and horling in the eare Was halfe the harme, and most of all the feare. Such men declarde, they had a det to pay, And still they wisht, in countries cause to die, They praysde that man, that serude his prince a day They were a feare, vnto the enmyes eye, They beautifyed, theyr bands with brauery: They bare the blowes, and broughte the yonglings on. And gaue the charge, when others lokt vppon, As erste I said, this campe so furnisht out Lord Gray the chiefe, Lord Skrope the Marshall than Of knightes and squires, if here I went about To show their names, as if I list I can, Time should I loose, and weary many a man To read their stiles, wherefore your leaue I craue To write such thinges, as in my head I haue. A skirmishe at Dumbar.The maner thus, before Dumbar they paste Where issued out, the French a silly bande On horse and foote, and not requyring faste To take me thought, the skirmishing in hand: And thus a while, both parties still did stand, Till cankred hate, had kindled malice newe, And badde our men, in field their foes pursewe. But in the ende, a few were hurt or slaine They driuen in, and none that skirmishe would, The campe marcht throw, &amp; did no while remaine Before Dumbar, the troth thereof is tould: The rest my penne, shall soone to you vnfould So that you do, my tale in order marke And as you ought, giue credit to my warke. At length in sight of Leeth our army preast I had forgot, how they the Scots Lords met Who brought with them, two Thousand men at least Few more I gesse, that were in order set But still in hope, a greater power to get They put vs in, So thus wee ioynde in on I may not longe, this matter rest vppon. But as I said, when sight of Leeth we had Like as the Bore, his brissels ginnes to shake When he is chaste, and fares as he were mad: Or as the Wolfe, that newly is awake In fury runnes, the sillie sheepe to take So did our men, the French full fast pursue Where sone was seene, the warres began a new. They had no minde, on peace proclaimde in Cheape The leage was brooke, they thought in London made Out goes the Pikes, the souldiours ranne in heape The scabberds falls, and forth was drawen the blade Some shotes apace, the others chardge and lade But ere the heate, of this great skirmishe grew The Dowager, with trumpet toke a trew. This staye of warre, made many men to muse How be it was, deuised of theyr Queene Some say by crafte, our Captaines to abuse And so it proude, none other as I weene: For here and there, the Frenchmen laye vnseene As though were ment, no harme on either side As fire lyes hid, vntill the smoke be spide. Our Campe came on, and sought their tents to pitch The Frenche drew neare, to view our maner throw Whereat Lord Gray, was discontented mitch And sent them word, they should retyre them now: Wherefore (? they,) we vnderstand not how Wee should giue place, or any waye be bounde To part from hence, and leaue our Maisters grounde. Yees (? my Lord) were not for promise sake Of truse a while, we should not reason longe: Vnder the pretence of peace they shotte in our faces.Full stoutly than, the French in braury spake Do what you dare, we will not take a wronge Wherewith in haste, they sange vs such a songe With curriar shotte, that had not hap bin good, They had soone shed, some of our worthist blood. For as our chiefe, and leaders of the field In daunger stoode, vnder the league we had, They vsde such warres, as haue bin seen but sield Full in our face, they shotte as they were mad: A tricke of Fraunce, a bluddy parte to bad But as God woulde, the skath they did was smale One m? slaine at the first.It was but one on whom the harme did fale. Our rage was great, our bloudes began to rise Our stomackes storde, as we did this beholde Throw out the Campe, the noyes ran to the skies At brute whereof, the coward wared bold The valiaunte man, had courage dubble fold: So that a lowde, a chardge, a chardge, they cride They taried not, and loked for a gide. But as by chaunce, each one his marrow mette They skirmished, as thicke as bees they swarme: Some loste their liues, and paide the earth his dette, Some were sore hurt, and had no further harme. I you assure, this skirmishe was so warme That as the haills, commes downe like rainy teares The curriar shotte, did ringe about our eares. If Barwick bands, had absent bin that daye A present plague, was like on vs to light, Uppon our foes, they ranne and ledde the way And still they put, the French perforce to flight. But yet I prayse some other men of right That serud ful wel, whose names if I should show Some here might say, the men we do not know. A further cause, hath staide my penne herein, All haue not fame, that worthy are therefore: All have not fame that do vvell. Some gets great thanckes, that silde in warres hath bin: Some serue so longe, their names are cleane out wore: Some haue ill frends, ill hap and that is more: So that their acts, lie dead and litle worth, For that no man, their deedes dare well set forth. I leaue this case, and to my matter cumme, That day was hot, and hard for to indure, The shot was such, there could no sound of drumme Be easly heard, the tune I you assure On both the sides, they put theyr force in vre: And if I shal, not lye for fauours sake, The French that while, serude well I vndertake. Full wise and ware, thay were in all their wayes And valiauntly, they did themselues defende. But as I do, their skill and manhode praise, So here I must, their boldnes discommende For had wee seene, what hapned in the ende Or knowen the ground, as reason did require Wee had full soone, compeld them to retire. Retire good Lord, So well it had not bin They had bin slaine, or taken euery man: But who can tell, who shal the victry win When men do meete, no more we knew not than Untill in deede, the heate of this began Where laye their rewen, where our good Fortune was: For battailes are, as brittle as the glas. Now conquest seemes, than ouerthrowes appeares: Now seemes it good, that after proues starke nought: Now is he free, that hapneth in the breares: Now men deuise, now all is out of thought: Now much is spoke, and litle thinges are wrought, This is the course, and custome of the warre Where wisedome bids, no man to go to farre. The soth to showe, if men before had knowen What vauntage great, to vs that day was due Wee had in deede, the Frenchmen ouerthrowen With litle losse: and yet I say to you It hapned well, as forth then matter grue: Our horsemen came, and gaue a charge ful well, In whom then laye, the seruice euery dell. Their names that chardge, I thincke vnfit to wright Sir Harry Kniuet hurte manfully at the charge. Who serueth well, at length must needes haue fame Let no man thincke, their deedes are buryd quight All though not here, the persons do I name I nill for that, my worke put out of frame. To them I leaue, at large that to disclose That after shall, this iourney wright in prose. Right hot a while, the enmies shot enduerd But sone was coeld, the terror of the same The horsemens force, in fine the French procuerd For to retire, nay runne awaye with shame: But yet I may, not much their doinges blame In order still, their battel stoode mee semde Fiue hundreth Pykes, they were as we estemde. But what should more, be said they shronke aside Tvvelue men of good name slaine on the Fr?ch side, and v. gentlemen taken prisoners And to theyr towne, they trotted as they might: But euery band, had not with him his gyde They bode the brunt, on them the bloes did light And as I heard, and sawe there compted right Twelue men of name, were slaine &amp; prisners fiue, Wee toke that day, and brought awaye aliue. Of common sort, of souldiours good and bad Full seuen skore, of them we put to sacke, And some sore hurt, into their towne they lad: Of ours in deede, a very fewe did lacke Some hurt, some slaine, our enmies put a backe And as in deede, the maner is of fortes The towne seing this, against them shut their portes. Wee hearde thearof, whan all this broile was donne But who could say, he saw the same the while, Each man can talke, whan that a thing is wonne And with conceites, his fansie oft beguile, Runne throw the hedge, and after leape the stile: This should be done, our after witts can say, But few at first, findes out the ready way. Well let that passe, we drew vs to our reste And euery man, made mirth as cause he founde, This bickring duerd, foure houres and more at lest. Men wilbe glad, when Trump retrait doth sound, That weary are, in trauesing the ground: So doubt I not, it did both parties please When they had found, a time to take their ease. In shot of Leeth, within Lastaricke than We pitchtte our Campe, where Cannons cabons brake And oft by chaunce, it kild a horse or man, But no man would, the Campe therefore forsake: Such tennis balles, did keepe our men awake, And quickned those, that wear dull sprited soules And made some ladds, to digge them deepe in holes. To saue the warde from harme of enmies shot Full many a trench, did Pellam cause be wrought, Loke what was meete, there was fewe things forgot: Our powre so small, by euery way we sought To keepe the same: But that auailed nought. Some were so rude, they ranne their death to seeke So thus decreast, our nomber euery weeke. A Bishop came, from Fraunce to treate a peace Muche talke there was, which time consumed still The byshop of Valence. But all this while, the wars did nothing seace To hurte our foes, we neuer wanted will At length vppon, a rocke a craggy hill We plaest a pece, and in a trenche beloo Was other store, of smaller shot also. Forget not here, the weather on the Seas Would not permitte, the Cannons for to lande The longer here, we laye to our disease For lacke thereof, which fewe doe vnderstande: I would demaunde, howe we should take in hande To laye a siege, or els our campe remoue When moste thinges lackte, that was for our behoue. Among our men, might Scottishe vitlers haunt Who with the Frenche, a treason tooke in hande The vvoman was duckt in vvater. A wife, a queane, did make the Frenche a graunte Upon this rocke, in sight of Leeth to stande: And there to make, a signe to Dozis bande When that the warde, were careles and at reste Which she did keape, her selfe the same confeste. The Frenche came on, as they thus warned were The bloudy monday. Like men of warre, they chose their time full well Our men starte vp, amasde with sodaine fere But what was beste, to doe they could not tell Some louing fame, his life did dearly sell Some hating death, did sone from daunger shonne Some past all shame, full fast away did runne. Some made defence, but still they stroue in vayne Once order broke, fare well the fight that howre So in this heate, was many a souldiour slayne There was no helpe, they were orelaide with powre Thus haue you heard, how fortune gan to lowre Upon our men, the chaunce of warre is suche A man may not, at no time trust it muche. But at this tide, full many a one was there Deserued praise, that are vntoucht for me And moste of those, that did them stoutly bere Were mangled than, myne eies the same did see But for they are, of meane and base degree I leaue them out, it is sufficient here If in the booke, of fame their names appere. Ye knowe when that, the waspe within his neste Is sturde with stick, or any other thing Assone as he, is troubled from his reste He crepeth foorth, and sharpely vnder winge He seketh place, for to bestowe his stinge: So lo our campe, that erst in quiet laye At noyes of this, began a fearfull fraye. Sir Iames a Croftes led the soldiours on their enemies.Now ran they foorth, and forward cryde they all The drummes did so?de, the souldiours made great spede Unto the trench, the Larum was not small But all to late, the helpe did come in dede The captaines still, their men with hope did fede And bad them marche, the day is ours ? they At sight of whome, the Frenche retierd away. Great terror made, the Curriars in our face The lord Gray that novve is vvas sore hurte at a valiaunt charge he gaue Some slaughter to, by that to vs arose But yet in spight, the foe forsoke the place And straight to Leeth, in haste the enmy gose Abide ? we, ye parte not without bloes Upon them rose, the boldest men we had All had not charge, that daye the way that lad. Undouttedly, the souldiours semd they wolde In sonder riue, the ramper with their handes And pluck them by, the eares out of their holde But as it was, they slewe vpon the sandes And left soer hurt, and groning on the landes I iudge at leste, as many men full oute Or more then we, had lost haue ye no doute. A bande of men, by this time to our aide At Musselbrough, were come vnarmd I gesse Of which reliefe, we helde vs well apaide The enmies store, therby became the lesse This done all thinges, were put in readines For to dismounte, such peces as we sawe Upon a churche, that kept our campe in awe. A battry small, against the same was set In halfe a daye, downe fell therof the chiefe Than for the siege, we found not so much let Our skirmishers, retired with lesse griefe Our men might come, more easely to reliefe But marke this well, such skirmishing I saye I neuer sawe, nor hard of er this daye. The mounting larke, no soner in the skie Then we were fourth: the Frenchemen were so braue Ne night nor day, they would not let vs lye In rest, for still, they did the skirmishe craue And they in holes, them selues could finely saue To cause great shot, to playe vpon their walles As though that we, were made vnto their calles. Rashnes of souldiours running out voide of conduit loseth all many tymes.And this they vsde, full ofte and to our harme Untill a staye, our leaders tooke therein Before in fielde, rawe men so thicke would swarme That long we seemd, more like to lose then wyn By rashnes rude, of suche as had not byn In warres before, but yet with exercise A white cote did, become both ware and wise. And serude as well, as any souldiour might With bowe and bill, suche weapons as we vse And oft therewith, they put the Frenche to flight What marueile not, you knowe this is no newes? The bowe hath ofte, made them the field refuse The bowe is feard, as farre as flies our fame And bowes I weene, wan Englishmen the name. Our enemies still, to skirmishe vs procuerd And gald our beste, and ouldest souldiours sore I tell you trothe, the heate of this enduerd Full long wherby, our men away we wore But God be thankt, the Frenchmens losse was more For still they spente, vpon the stock ye knoe When we without, had meane to come by moe. By depe foresight, a mounte there was deuisde Which bare the name of Pellam for the space I had forgot, how Frenchmen cam disgisde In womens wedes, like queanes with muffled face They did no acte, but sone they tooke the chace I see that passe, and of the mounte I treate Where to be playne, the seruice was full greate. The Captaine there, one Cutbert Vaughan was Sir Andrevve Corbet vvas here and other gentlemen. And ioynd with him, there were a number mo This mounte thus made, the campe away did passe More nere the towne, how much I nede not shoo This mounte to Leeth, was still a daily foo The peces there, a longe the rampere shott Some harme they did, but what full fewe men wott. Upon the sandes, they could no cockells seeke But that this forte, might easely them anoy Some derely bought, their muskels eury weeke Some sacrifisde, their horse to swete saint Loy Some in their heads, did take so mad a toy They neuer spake, a worde ne good nor ill Some lernde to feele, the weight of our black bill. A bande of horse, there were to warde that forte Which eury day, did serue full worthely With whom the French, some times for chaunge of sporte Would mete and so, the matter would they trye The Frenche full oft, I can not this denye, Made Sallies forth, as tryme as men might do And so went home, with blud and honor to. But commonly, in dede, the worst they gate Yet stil they brau'd, and bare their fortune out Their warlike shiftes, they were of suche a traed My penne shall but, ecclips them out of doute To painte them right, but since I go aboute To praise them thus, I will procede for shame And let them haue, their owne deserued fame. Policy the preseruer of all gouernmentesFirst all they did, was drawen by orders skill And seld they paste, the boundes of reasons lore By pointe deuise, they skirmished at will: That we perceiud, they practised no more That we feard not, and had not seen before They put in vse, thus still their heads they bende To purchase prayse, and eke the towne defende. Great neede they had, them selues to vse full well For all their liues, vpon their doings laye What should I more, vpon this matter dwell To tier your eares, and waste the time away There was no side, stode idell halfe the daye But on both partes, for seruice driftes were founde And euery howre, we draue them from their grounde. Maister Pellam Lieutenaunt of the ordinaunceAt Pellams mounte, by foote and horsemen both This trade full long, did there the souldiours kepe Whose payne was much, and sore I tell you trothe For at no time, in quiet could they slepe And specially, when day began to pepe The shot went of, then souldiours to their toyle And as hap drewe, they did abide the spoyle. I nowe returne, vnto our campe awhyle That laye where shot, did daily them salute And where the Frenche, with many a warlike wyle Did showe our men, of warres what was the frute And where some get, their death by littell suet A skarre, a maime, and suche a rude rewarde As moste men findes, that do that life regarde. I spake afore of bickrings, by the Frenche But here the heate, of seruing might be seen They bearded vs, and made them trenche for trenche And shewed them selues, trimme souldiours as I ween But what of that, we came to serue the Queene Though to our losse, our courage did we vse We forst our foes, their trenche at lengthe refuse. And to their milles, we wente and burnt them downe Slew them we founde, where many hurte were than In seruice great, right nere before the towne Our hap was such, that we the honour wan: Not onely here, but euer when began A skirmishe, or a bickering any where Which as we gesse, we wanted seldome there. A thondring notes, they made when they came foorth Their ratling shot, did perce the cloudes me thought To show the truthe, their Corriars were more woorth Then double tolde, the peces that we brought And to be plaine, our shot they counted nought Yet as it was, when that our men came nere The Frenchmen bought, their comming forth full dere. Yet would they not, be kept no tyme within An hundreth tymes, they issued out I gesse And sought for death, their honor for to wyn What ere they loste, they braud no whit the lesse If here I should, all skirmisshes expresse What they haue done, what we haue wrought likewise Of paper sure, a quere would not suffice. Unto my tale, my penne I praye thee passe What humer brought: thy reason here so wyde You knowe good folkes, in what discours I was The campe thus plaste, we did reliefe abide Muche losse eche daye, we had I will not hide And greater harme, was likely to ensue If some had not, made vp their bandes anewe. Of watche and warde, our men so wery were They carelesse stoode, of any hap at all The nightes were fowle, the dayes not very fear The countrie could, their garmentes thinne and small And still vpon, their Captaines gan they call A saute, a saute, we lye ore long in trenche Let vs go spende, our liues vpon the Frenche. It seemed good, the towne for to assaile Men willing were, in Princes cause to fight The battry shot, but that did not preuaile Muche pouder spente, the charges was not light Smale skathe it did, as semed to our sight This dare I saye, so sharpe a pele so ronge I neuer harde, but yet it durde not long. For this assault, lewde ladders, viele and nought The souldiours had, which were to shorte God wot The profe thereof, with blud the poore men bought Had they ben long, the towne we might haue got But looke what God, assigned to our lot We could not shonne, nedes must it come to passe That he appointes, as there good triall was. Let those thinges go, I kepe an other vaine Captaine Randall gaue vvarning vvhen thassault should be ginne. Of this assault, the manner show I shall First were our men, in battaile rangid plaine And gardid well, with horsemen were they all The reste in trenche, did stand as did befall Till warning made, of Randall maior there At which they past, to Leeth withouten fere. The drommes did sounde, the trumpettes blew alowde The Cannons shot, the bowmen stode not still The smoke was like, a fogge or mistie clowde That poulder made, our souldiours lackt no will To clyme the walles, where they receiud much ill For when they laide, their ladders in the dike They were to shorte, the lengthe of halfe a pike. The flankers than, in murdring holes that laye Went of and slew, God knowes stoute men enow The harquebuz, afore hand made fowle playe But it behoud our men, for to go throw And so men sought, their deathes they knew not how From such a fight, swete God my frendes defende For out of frame, did diuers finde their ende. To see poore soules, there wander in the dikes The stones were flunge, the curriar bet them downe The wounded men, let fall both bowes and pikes The mangled heapes, that creped from the towne The slaughter foule, and here the wofull sowne That Souldiours cries, there made I thinke in dede Would sure compell, a stony harte to blede. The brute of this, abasht our bouldist men And cut our combes, as all were cast away The coward sorte, did steale them homewarde then And some in campe, came neuer since that day Some sought discharge, Some sawe so great a fray They wisht they had, at home bin keaping Crooes Suche is the warres, where men both wyn and looes. I leue that case, and nowe returne I shall To those that daye, were leaders in the felde And for in ryme, I cannot show it all And well set forth, in ryme are Saultes but selde And wordes I lack, and that I am vnskilde To seke out termes, that apte are for that case In prose I minde, therefore the same to place. That shall I wright, when this I draw anew Which in short time, I mynde at large to set But for the first, it may suffice to you This naked rime, out of my handes to get Yet if I liue, I will be in your det To paye you once a better sum I thinke Then I haue yet, set forth with penne and ynke. An other mounte, that Somerset was cald The Earle of VVorceters brother, maister Frances Somerset. Deuised was, where Somerset was plast This forte full ofte, the French both slew and gald And many a time, their peces it defast Here you must note, these mountes were not in waste For if they had, not helde the towne in awe We could not it, besege for ought I sawe. If that the frenche, with frendes that were without Had ventred all, and stode to fortunes hap In daunger greate, we had bene out of doute And likely sure, we were to fall in trap But lo our chiefe, misdowting suche a clap For wante of men, to sege the enmies rounde Deuised fortes, vpon the metest grounde. In this meane while, there came S. Fraunces Leake Sir Frances Leake came to our reliefe. To our reliefe, whereof much nede we had A greater lack, we had there than I speake Of men and helpe, whiche made our hartes full sad But still with wordes, the councell did vs glad And said the Duke, was comming haue no drede Who muche desirde, for to supplie our nede. The Frenche came forth, at midnight after this As though they would, a Canuozado make But as God wrought, their purpose did they misse For though some men, the trenchis did forsake An other sorte, defence did vndertake And stode so sure, and shot so in their face That there they slew, a Corprall in the place. They seing that, full hastely retirde And lokte not backe, their fellowes for to see To tourne againe, was none that them desirde Eache man is glad, to see his enmye flee A bridge of gould, giue him that runnes from thee The wyse man biddes, which councell they that maye Will not refuse, in warres I dare well saye. Now must you note, the Frenchemens hartes were hie And of reliefe, they made a great auaunte And for they serud, before their mistris eye The feates of armes, the more they vsd to haunte As though our campe, their courage could not daunte Wherefore full late, at night when Sunne was set They issued out, to take vs in a net. Upon our trenche, and all along the sandes They came amaine, farre past a marching pase And brought abrode, their braue and chiefest bandes But as God would, we met them in the face Where lo the shot, enduerd a maruelous space Some men of theirs, that while cride shirlly bowes So nere the campe: that vp the souldiours goes. A larom in our ovvn campe by the French policie.A Larom long, among them there they had And sundry sortes, of thinges they thought thereon But at the trenche, was many a stubborne lad Which still with shot, did prese the French vpon And lefte them not, vntill that they were gon Or sawe them flye, there whitcotes serud so well I lack but time, their worthines to tell. Our enmies now, became more circumspecte And curtsie made, so nere our campe to come They would not lose, their men to small effecte Nor had no will, to hap in whytcoates thom They sent them in, without the sounde of dromme They kept such sturre, as neuer yet I sawe And yet at first, they were but blunt and rawe. Still did we hope, to haue from Barvvick aide It coms this day, ? one, it will not faile The fame wherof, did make the Frenche afraide They knew they must, abide a newe assaile This newes among, our men did much preuaile But in the ende, they sawe small haste was made Wherfore their mindes, were in an other trade. The Dovvager, the Queene of Scottes fell sicke This while whereon, at length this lady dyed, Whose death did touche, the Frenchemen to the quicke For sure their frende, she was as well was tried (And to her realme, it cannot be denied She was full faste) a Princes of hye sprete For Fraunce a perle, a member apt and mete. I had almoste, left out a skirmishe here Upon the sandes, where horsemen honor gate And in despight, they rode the Frenche so nere That diuers Frenche, were ouerthrowne therat Although that here, I partly touched that You must not thinke, but diuers dayes likewyse The horsemen kept, this common course and guise. As tyme consumd, so still our men did waste And nedefull was, for aide or els for peace And to be briefe, our country made no haste From watche and warde, our Souldiours to releace Great murmurs still, among vs did increace But dewtie bad, eache Souldiour do his beste Till swete reliefe, should bring poore soules some reste. The byshop of Valence from Fraunce.From Fraunce there came, Embasadours this to ende And from our Queene, the like to vs was sente About the same, they did muche labour spende My Lorde of Burleighe that novve is, came to conclude this peace.And as you knowe, both parties were contente The Frenche by Sea, vnto their country wente Compeld with force, they did forsake the towne To our great fame, and honor of the crowne. First giue me leaue, our Souldiours to aduaunce That with their blud, their countries rest haue brought Next how they serud, against the flower of Fraunce And last of all, did bring their bragges to noughte And more then this, note here and kepe in thoughte They being weake, did make the strong to bow And to their home, returne with conquest now. Lord Burleigh ended these broyles.But or I go, to farre in Souldiours praise The instrumentes, that endid all this toyle I must set foorth, whose graue and sober waies And stoutnes both, did giue the Frenche a foyle They forste the Frenche, to yeld to their own spoyle They did perswade, nay rather them compell To parte to Fraunce, as all men knowes full well. Was this none acte, to worke them so like waxe That were as harde, as flinte or stony steele And quencht the fyre, that was so nere the flaxe And seast the plage, that many one might feele And brought vs peace and cast all warre at heele And as a man, might saye mawgre their teethe Drew out the Frenche, out of the towne of Leeth. Because the brute, and betill headed braines Can not conceiue, the depenes of this peace And that some thinke, that we haue loste our paines Or that by this, may further warres encreace For that I would, suche fonde conceiptes should seace Here shall I showe, the sum of all the same As nere as I, can put suche thinges in frame. By this we haue, that many kinges did seek A perfit peace, with Scotland suer for aye By this the Frenche, that nestlid nere our cheek Full many yeares, are now dispatcht away By this small broyle, did seace a greater fray By this our realme, was rid from further care Our foes sent home, and we in quiet are. By this our Queene, hath all her owen requestes Unfit for you, to know therof the weight By this great things, as yet in question restes Till for our wealth, they shalbe framed streight By this our fame, is lifted suche an height That euery wight, that throwly wayes this chaunce Shall saye we stroue, against the flower of Fraunce. How happie are, the Subiectes hie and low Rueld by the Prince, in whose time this was wrought Whiche for the zeale, of her own realme you know And Scotlandes loue, hath set expence at nought And in her dayes, to passe suche thinges hath brought As seldome could, be compast well with wit Wherefore the fame, therof to her is fit. Here haue you harde, of Leeth the ordre throwe As farre as ryme, will suffer me to wryte In prose who liste, to make rehersall nowe Thereof hath skope, to show in paper whyte A better waye, that shall you more delighte For this was done, as there I saw it then And time but shorte, I had to vse my penne. A FAREVVELL when I went to studie, written to the worlde. Farewell thou world, that me betrayde to long To dearely bought, I find thy follies all Who shall the serue, is sure to suffer wrong: Who skorns thy happs, may shunne thy sodaine fall. Who fawnes on thee, shall drincke thy bitter gall: Who flyes thy toyes, thy painted face shall find Who sooner slides, than those which at thy call Liues like thy slaues, in body, soule, and mind. First from a child, with fancies was I fedde All at thy hands, till I to manhode grue: Than in the darke, loe blindfeld was I ledde, So that my God, my selfe, nor man I knue. Wield wit, yong bloud, old vice, new bred in bones, Made me forget, my dutie all at ones. Faire things, foule thoughts, fond works &amp; flattring eas, Had moffled mee, and hodwinckt so my wits, That in the storms, I drad no Sillas seas, Nor in the calms, I feard no froward fits Which were to come: things present pleasde me best Those gone I made, no myrror to the rest. Bed soft, full mouth, gay backe and foolish fame Was all I sought, like Lord to liue at lust At my nowne shape, and shadow had I game A looking glasse, a plaiffeer trim at trust To prie a pon, my life thus did I frame Cleane out of tune, I see it now full well So that my life, was carelesse eurye dell. Yet found I haue, a heape of other harms Thereby: what than, I cannot them amende When dead they seeme, than spring they vp by swarms Such mischiefe riep, wil haue a rotten ende Though at the full, the tied of them are now The ebb may come, when God a time shall sende Leaue that to him, and I shall tell you how I learnde to know, the course and kinde of man His nature new, his fashion halfe disgiesde And how for shame, at length lo I began To follow that, which I afore dispiesde Full welcome ought, that learning be to me Which taught me wit, when wieldnes weaud the loeme Of wanton wayes: and blindnes gan to see The path he miste, the way that ledde me home Unto the Port, where I would harbred be And rather dwel, with quiet settled minde Than roue abrode, to seeke vncertaine luck Or subiect be, to filthy worldly muck I would not sure: be bound to such a clogg That would me rob, of reason and good skill And in the ende, but fishe and catch a frogg. As some haue done, and some do vse it still Which snatch the bone, before the hongry dogg Who will not part, from that hee hath in hold Although in deede, his maister would it haue Unto this ende, this tale now haue I told To show him wyse, that knoweth what to craue And asks of those, that freely giues for nought But he most wise, that hath no greedie thought And can content, him with those litle skraps That falls by lot, vnto him for his share And finds no fault, at others worldly haps But hath a head, as free from inward care As babe new borne, yea such a one may smile And laugh his fill, when some cryes wo the pye He shall see much, that hath a simple eye That man shal see, the strong the weake begile The poore by rich, and mighty swallowd vpp The harmles drincke out of the poisned cupp The needie lacke, that greedy raueners gripe The theues let goe, that robbs in skarlet weeds And sitts on bentch, when troeth feeles many a stripe How feare is dubd, a knight for coward deeds How manhoode beggs, and none are helpt that needs How creepe in hools, that did no hurt at all Are valiaunt calde, such is the peoples bruite The quiet man, these thinges behold he shall And see them passe, and learne thereby some fruite As I haue done, though farre from quiet minde In any case, my selfe God wotte I finde Saue that to toile, and burthens for to beare I framed am, and letts the world alone Amid my foes, that fawns and speaks full fear I liue a louff, and will not be a knowne There hate I haue, I must dissemble there As doth those mates, that playes at Fortunes ball Do not some halte, that well may go vpright Who can denie, but we dissemble all In some one pointe, and wisedome we it call Thinges are not founde, as they do seeme to sight Some laugh in hart, yet show a weeping eye You haue hard say, the blind eates many a flie How should the sadde, with wantons myrth agre Note The hole with sicke, the wise with foolishe dwell The prowde with meeke, the meane with mighty be If all these sorts, could not dissemble well And euen so, it fareth now by me I wincke at things, that I would not behold And see those faule, that profites mee no whit I heare likewise, that I can wishe vntold I shoote with them, that neuer marke may hit, But me beleue, yet winne the game I would Among that sort, that giueth aem to sit I like not sure: I rather wishe to bet Than loke apon, and lay on near a sied. Set doubts a part, it is good sport to get But he that winns, must hazard needes abide. (I leaue you there) I would so make my game It wear halfe won, before the match wear tride And make him thincke, that hits the marke is wide And say himselfe, he roueth out of frame I pray you now, who would not do the same To gaine thereby, or els at least to saue: Than graunt me this, dissemble sure he must As I may do, or in time paste I haue And made some blind, that better saw than I And sawe full oft, that I would not perceiue When that thereon, did life or daunger lye And yet I lookt, and leered by your leaue What might befall, and sought to shun the shocke: And as I fled, ill Fortune followd faste Whan she would strike, I scaped many a knocke By douking downe, I knew so well her cast With cap and knee, her fauour sone I wan So in a while, she toke me as her man. But whan I thought, most hold of her to take A way she wente, the whirle winde in her taile Yet with her frends, fayre wether did I make Whose helpe was good, wh? world began to faile. And if you aske, how I acquainted was With such sure props, that holds vp house and all And how that I, could bring such things to passe To keepe me vp, whan diuers sought my fall: (His fall not great, it cannot be I trow Whose climinge vp, was neuer much you know) This by the way, I speake yet aunsweare loe To you I make, that this demaundes of mee To Courte I came, whear I could hear and see Note. As others did, and with the strong I stoode As world did wag, I wound my barke about And leand me there, wher I could find most good In deede this was, the way to beare it out And there I founde, of eurye sort ynow: Would I be braue, I knew wher mates were had Would I be stout, I saw who would not bow, Hie lookes was he, that stil I saw go throw: That shippe made way, that all the sailes could beare, Small sprite sate low, with finger in his eare Great curtchie crept, full hie among the best He made them laugh, that lokt as he would sweare He carryed coales, that could abide no geast Plaine life the lowt, was litle set by theare Fine taunting tongues, brought many a foole in feare. Make loue the meeke, was ready at a call Faine would be seene, was fisking eurye where Set forth to sale, was markt beyonde them all. Uaine glorie smield, and loekt for much a doe New fanglenes, shaekt off old frendship past Fien faule at foote, could whine and bite you toe. Proude blind consait, would not be placed last, Small witte would laugh, at wiser than him selfe, Disdaine that dwarfe, loekt like a piuishe elfe Straunge nature fround, when homely folkes sate downe Full purse found frendes, that came but late to towne. Set by himselfe, would not salute but fewe Small worth made boest, still mouth was all the shrewe.

A FAYNED FANCYE betweene the Spider and the Gowte. If that ye list to giue me eare, And with my matter for to beare: Although a Fable tell I shall, It is to make you meerie all. Ye may some pleasure finde therein, And yet my tale, not worth a pinne: As I haue hard from thinges of nought, Is wisedome and greate knowledge sought. Yea goulde is gotten out of drosse, And torues are made of mucke and mosse: That beetes the poore a goodly fire, Nowe to my tale I will retire. Tenne Thousand yeare agoe at least, I meane whan eurye birde and beast: And eurye thing that we can name, Could talke and reason in good frame. It hapned than, make you no doute, Betweene the Spider and the Goute: There fell a strife full straunge to heare, Which was ear ended was that yeare. These two would know by chaunge of place, Who furthest stoode in Fortunes grace: And which of them was best at ease, So ech a part as he did please A master chose, vnto his minde, A day betweene them was assinde, Whan that the yeare was full runne out, For talke twene Spider and the Gout. And at which season meete they would, Their haps and Fortune to vnfold, The greuous griping goute should goe: Unto a husband man I troe. And dwell with him for that yeare than, The Spider to a gentleman: And so they parted seueral wayes, But which of them had mirrist dayes. Here after shall you here me tell, The Spider was not welcomde well: Into the Pallace where he dwelt, Note. But rather many a mischiefe felt. For eury day there was a maide, That made the Spider sore afraide: With mirry Larke, this maiden roes, And straight about the house she goes. With swapping Besome in her hand, And at her girdle in a band: A iolly bontch of keyes she wore, Her pecticoet fine laest before. Her taile tockt vp in trimmest gies, A Napkin hanging oer her eyes: To keepe of duste and drosse of walles, That often from the windowes falles. Though she was smog, she toke small eas, For thrifty girlls are glad to pleas: She wanne the loue of all the house, And pranckt it like a pretty mouse. And sure at eury word she spake, A goodly curtchie could shee make: A stoering houswyfe eury where, That bent both backe and boones to bere. She neuer sleeped muche by night, But roes sometimes by candell light To card and spinne, or sowe her smocke: There could no soner crow a cocke. But she was vp, to sleek her cloes, And would be sweete, as any roes: Full cleanly still the girle would goe And handsome in a house also: As euer sawe I countrie wentch, She sweeped vnder eury bentch: And shaekt the coshens in their kinde, When out of order did she finde. A rushe a straw or little sticke, She could it mend she was so quicke. About her busnes eury houre, This maide was calde her mistres floure. She bare the keyes of Ale and Beare, And had the rule of better cheare: She was not nice, nor yet to kinde, To proude nor of, to humble minde. To fine nor yet, to braue I troe, She had as fayre as I do knoe: Two faire newe kirtles to her backe, The one was blue, the other blacke. For holy days she had a gowne, And eurye yard did cost a crowne: And more by xviii. pence I gesse, She had thre smocks she had no lesse. Foure raylls and eek fiue karchers fayre, Of hose and shoes, she had a payre: She needed not, no more to haue, She would go barefoote for to saue. Her shoes and hoose, for they were dere, She went to towne, but ones a yere: At Easter or some other day, When she had licens for to play I had forgotten for to tell, She had a pursse shee loued well: That hanged at a ribende greene, With tassails faire, and well beseene. And as for gloues and kniues full bright, She lacked not, nor trifles light: As pins and laces of small cost, I haue to you rehearsed most Of all her goodes, Now to the forme, And making of this creeping worme: Her port was lowe, her face was fayre, It came no sooner in the ayre, But it woulde pill, her cheekes were thin, God knowes she had, a tender skin. The worst mischape this minion had, Her leggs were sowllon very bad, Some heauy humor downe did fall, Her foote was narrow short and small: Her body sklender as a snigg, But sure her buttocks were full bigg. That came I thincke by sitting mitch, And in her side she had a stitch: That made her oft short winded sure, But her complexion was full pure. She was well made from toppe to taile, Yea all her lims withouten faile: Were fine and feat, she had a hand There was no fayrer in the land. Saue that with toile, it chaunged hue, Her fingers small, her vaines full blue: Her naills a litle largly growen, Her hear much like the Sunne it shoen. Her eyes as blacke as Iet did seeme, She did herselfe ful well exsteeme: Her lipps were red but some what chapt. Her tongue was still and seldome clapt. She spake as she were in a cloude, Neither to soft, nor yet to loude: And tript apon the floer as trim, He would haue thought that she did swim. As she did goe, such was her pace, She minssed fine, like maistres Grace: That at the daggar dwelled oens, Who made good pies of Mariboens. I dare depoes apon a booke, Shee was as good a maiden cooke: As euer drest a peece of meate, And for a banket small or great. And raysing Paest she passed still, As soone as flowre came from the Mill: She made the goodliest kaeks thereof, And backt as faire a houshold loef. As ear was seene or set on bord, What needes more talke? at one bare word The greatest Lady in a sheer, She might haue sarued seuen yeer, This maide as you do vnderstande, With swinging beesome in her hand: About the windowes would she prie, And where she might a Spider spie: Downe went his webb and all his worke. The Spider had no place to lorke: Nor make his skaffold hie nor loe, But that this maiden still would goe. Unto a Forme or els a stoel, And with some kinde of reatching toel: She raught the silly Spiders neast, The Spider found no other feast. But eurye day foule serued was, Somtime he builded neer the glas. Somtime full oer his maisters hed, Somtime befoer the maydens bed: Behind the skreen, or on the wawll, Somtime in parlor or in hawll. In priuey or at portall doer, But still this mayde vpon the floer: Would fling him flat and clap her foet, (When that she sawe no other boet) Upon the Spyder if she might, But though he lakt, both sens and sight: His skrawling legs did help him oft, Full soen ye should him see aloft. And thear he would a web begyn, But all in vayn the foell did spyn: For loek what all the night he wrought, The maid at morrn, brought clean to nought This torment still the Spyder had, Whan any flye, had maed him glad: And fell in to the Spyders trap, Then should thear faull, a fearfull clap. A broom or els, a littell poell, Maed Spyder seek an other hoell: He lost his Fly, his house and all, In wyndo cloes, nor open wall. He might not dwell, he felt such wrong, The Spyder thought, this yeer full long: And wisht that hit, wear all ron out, That he might reason with the Gowt. To heer which of them boeth had felt, The better dayes, whear they had dwelt: The Govvt had found, as ill an oest, The vereist drudg in all the coest. For if he might a penny wyn, He labred throw boeth thick and thyn. And yet he was an honest man, So held in all the parish than: A good housholder and a iust, But suer he liued not by lust. Nor sought his eas to lyg in bed, To many a mouth yet gaue he bred. And yet I ges nowe by my lyef: Neither this man, nor yet his wyef. Wear worth fiue pounds in reddy gold, Though they an honest house did hold. At plow and cart, his goods he gaet, He lay not long, nor watched laet: Nor with ill ruell, no surfet found, He eat and drank, and slept full sound. This gruntting grobbe was short &amp; thick, His face was red as any brick: Whear in thear stoed a bottell noes, A couple of corns vpon his toes. He had which maed him cut his shue, He neuer put on garment nue, But whan that to the waeks he went, He was drest vp, like Iack a Lent: And coblar like, whan he did wortch. But when this yoman went to chortch. A sleueles iacket than he waer, A veluet nightcap half threed baer: A chamled dobled stockt with sylk, His short fayer weysht as whit as milk. But herein must be vnderstoed, His wief was come of gentyll bloed: Which would not haue him clad in clouts, But whan he moyld with other louts. Than caerd she not what he put on, His house hit was not maed of stoen. The wauls with lyem wear whitted well, And thatcht oer hed, the troeth to tell: The smock cam forth the thatch somtime, But who did on the rafters clyme. Should finde fat bakon hanging thear, The house could not be kept full fear: For Hens and Capons, Dogs, and Cats, About his bed wear many Gnats. That hommed still vpon his face, And full of myce was eury place: Of children had he many a oen, But idell in the house was noen. Except it wear an infant yong, The maydens to their wheell they song: The Carddars myrry wear also, The hyends about the fields did go. The Oxen champped in the stawll, The pygs lay grontting by the wawll: The capuls fed vpon their hay, The Hens full many an egge did lay. The Gees weare gagglyng on the green, And in good order as I ween: Wear all things that this poore man had, The Gowt therof was very glad. And thought to trie him for a yeer, And so to taest, cold countrey cheer: And as the poore man soundly slept, In to his ioynts the Gowt he crept. Like theef that steals vpon a wyght, That ryeds a loen in wynters night: So stept the Gowt vnto this man, And sought to vexe, his body than. And hoept when poer man easd his grief, That he should finde such great relief. Such rest, such skoep, and tak such hold, Of man to wander whear he wold: Yea suer the Gowt had found a soyll, He thought to bring to vtter spoyll. But loe as leysy lobber laye, A bed and groend, in break of daye: His wyef so fowll a bawling kept, And sayd fie husband you haue slept. God knoes awaye boeth wyt and thrift Be God ye must maek better shift: To pay our rent our Landlord cries, On plowe and cart our wealth must ries. And not on stretching in the bed, Ye kno your children must be fed: Your seruants kept and wagis payd, In deed good man I am afrayd. That we shall forfeit leace and all, And into shaem and beggry fall: Ye kno your wyef doth go full baer, And loeks so lean with cark and caer. She changed hath her collor clean, Unto a Peas, or partched Bean: And wydthers lyek a cock of hey, Yea glad to feed on crudds and whey. And pintch her belly for your saek, And though I chees and butter maek I sell the saem to maek vs rytch, Yet well ye wot we haue not mytch. My goown is lyk to go to gaeg, The Landlord is in such a raeg: He will haue money out of hand, He must redeem his morgaegd land That youthfull frysks in hazard brought, Tushe man your wife tacks all the thought. Not only how to paye the rent, But also howe to liue in Lent: And get some herrings hoem ye knoe, Our stoer is gon full long agoe. When fleash and whytmeat waxeth deer, A herring cobbe will wake good cheer. Among our hynds and children toe, Let neighbours witnes what I doe. To maintaine houshold in good staet, I washe, I wryng, I watch vp laet: I fast, I spaer, I skrat, I skraep, And after goods, and gayn I gaep. Whyels husband taeks his pleasuer still, And hoeps to haue the world at will: By sleep and crying out of payn, Let ries a blyster or a blayn Upon your littell fingers end, Straight for a surgion must you send: Your father could taek salt and sut And lyuly lyek a lusty gut. A medsin maek for eury soer, And neuer would ly down therfor: No though in deed the shyn wear broek, Fy lie not smearing in the smoek. For folysh smarts, and stitchis viell, The husbandman, began to smyell: To heer the babbling of his daem, But nill he would he, world did fraem. So awkward wyth this sylly soull, That vp he roes, and toek a powll: In feble hand, to stay vpon, But busnes sayd he must begon. And haeld him out of doer in haest, This goodly grubbe with fagot waest. Bestoers his ioynts about the feld, In things whear on pooer men aer skild: And seldome stayd in any place, Ashaemd in house to hyed his face. Or vnder hedge or tree to rest, This trobled much his new come gest: The gowt I mean, but caerles loe, Of gowt the poore man trodged thoe. Oer hedge and styell, he skipt and flang. And as the birds on boeshes sang, He whistled all the way he went, And hoemward for his brekfast sent. Whyels hee the Oxen yoeked fast, And clyemd the trees to beat down mast: For swyen that must in haest be sold, And put the skattred sheep in fold. He did, for sheppard had he noen, For loe the greatest flock was goen: And needles seruants aer not fyt, This man had need pluck vp his wyt. To pleas his wyef, and pay his due, What shuld I longer talk to youe: Of his affayrs, about he flees, As though his hed wear full of bees. He ran lyk heund that hunts the haer, (And of the gowt toek littell caer) About his work, now heer, now thear, Somtime with Brambuls would he tear. His coet, his skin, and knock his knee, Against a stubbe or croked tree: And as he after horses ran, Somtime fell down this honest man. No soeuer vp, but troedgd abowt, Theas iobs lyekt not the tender gowt. He loekt for pylloes soft and sweet, And oyntments for the swollon feet: And plaesters warm to humors cold, And in fayre clowts to be enrold. And not to find such froward faer, Well what of that, good husbands aer: A labring to make vp their mowse, (And wyn thear bred by sweat of browse) As was this wyght wher on I wryt, Abroed in field was his delyt. In many a shuer and bitter blast, And eury day till noen wold fast: For wantton will he would not eat, But honger sausyd still his meat. And seldom roes with belly full, His children from his mouth wold pull: The bred, the chees, and other cheer, He kept no houshold for a yeer. And waested all in littell space, But for his lief time in oen cace: Ye should his order finde so well, To much thear was not near a dell. Nor yet to littell as he throue, The tyme and world away he droue: And maed of peas and bakon sod, In eeuen house a banket od. A feast that fylde the empty paunch, A ioncket that will honger staunch: As soen as costly martchpaen fien, And Sydor in the steed of wien. And that was dronk at hy myd meall, A stroek of roest, of beef or veall: On eury Sonday did he vse, And all his hardnes would he skues. With marraeg of his doughter Kaet, And still he sayd, twas better laet: To thryue than neuer saue a groet, He could on fingers ends by roet. Rehers the cours of all the yeer, The chang of Mooen, and could goe neer: To tell whan eury starre should ries, And talke of planets in the skies. But that he lernd by sheppards ruell, At Whytsontyed, at Paece and Yuell: He gaue his housholde leaue to play, And than at stoelball all the day. Ye might haue founde the mery gyrls, Bedeckt with works and roefs of pyrls: And fine froes pasts yee startcht full tryme, And siluer pyns about eatch bryme. As pretty pearls wear shining thear, They had no gymmols at the ear: For that nue trick cam out of Spayn, Yet though their garments were but playn. They had as piuyshe paets I knoe, As had in town the corstest shroe: That goes in skarlet now and than, In houshold with this hoemly man. Wear wentchis worth the looking on, Well yet the gowt would needes be gon: His oest had near a lodging good, To harbor such a heuy blood. And yet he must his yeer abyed, And throw the fier be better tryed: This man had maed a bargaine nowe, And shaept to sell boeth Bull and Cowe. The Sheep and Oxen in the stawll, To by a better farm withall. And out of hand a iorney great, He had to goe, in cold and heat: And all a foet this must be don, With butten cap and clowtted shon. With wallet full of bread and chees, And ragged russet coet of Frees: And on his back he boer a bryeb, And littell thought vpon the kyeb. That hard behind the heell he had, The bargayn maed the foell so glad: That out he went as he wear wood, And seldom suer in quiet stood. Till clean dispatcht, theas things had byn, The Gowt that lorked clos within: At hand beheld theas outward woes, Than straight vnto the Spyder goes. And maeks a soer complaynt of this, The Spyder that tormentid is: A wors discours to him he told, Thear maisters after chang they wold. As they deuiesd, and brought to pas, The Gowt and Spyder placed was: At eas as we may find full well, With hie degree the Gowt did dwell. And propped vp with koshons gaye, On bed or bentche, at will he laye: If Gowt his maister did diseas, Moest glad he was the Gowt to pleas. With furrs and clowts to keep hit warm, And to auoyd a further harm. The Gowt was hapt and handled soft, And with swet earbes well bathed oft: And fed with dainty meats enowe, The knee nor ioynt durst no man bowe. That Gowt had gouernd this was true, Yea eury owr, a pashon nue: Hit brought and bred in maisters hart, And shronk the vains in eury part. But he that ons had lodgd this gest, (And bent him self to geue him rest:) Must needs whyels lief doth last take pain, As loe thy maister was full fain. The Gowt had found so fien a traed, That as he would his resdens maed: From hand to foet, from knee to wryst, And rueld his master as him lyst. With yomen will I dwell no moer, ? he, for fear of handling soer: Nor part I tro from gentill bloed, The Spyder in liek case he stoed. He maed his cobwebs whear he wold, And in his lodging was as bold: As any oen may be at hoem, And further ment he not to roem. He found no mayd his rest to let, They wear to other labour set: Thus Gowt and Spyder wear full glad, That they their maisters changed had. And so I leaue them for this tyme, Note.And heer knit vp this croked ryme. This taell is written for your wealth, To sho wherin consists your health: I do but heer example mack, Of things I trust ye not mistaek. Therby declaring as I can, That eury grief that coms to man: By idell lief doth gro and spring, The Gowt is soner with a king. Note. Than with a weary labring wyght, Why is it rather with the might: Than with the mean, but for in deed, That honger maks the poer man feed. So diuersly he fedeth not, As doth the rich man well ye wot: The rich haeth many a fyen deuice, His mynd and diet is so nice. He knoes not what to eat is best, And maks full many a needles feast: To stoer the lust and pleas the mouth, With sondry sortes of things vncowth. The belly is no soner full, The bones must rest, and down he wull: Upon a bed, or in a chayre, Syts stretching when to taek the ayre. He should go walk the fields abowt, The want wherof doth breed the Gowt: I mean of to much eas doth ryes, Great harm and grief in sondry wyes. And most of those that fienly faer, Without some sicknes neuer aer: For eury meat must haue his kynd, In Stories old I read and fynd. That man by roots and erbs lyud long, And so grue mighty larg and strong: Boeth hoell and sound, and well dispoesd, Untill our knoledge had discloesd. That fleash was sweet and fish good meat, But when therof we gan to eat: A ranker bloed that foed did breed, And causd moer humors than did need. And altred so our lyuely vayns With swellings strang with botch &amp; blayns: That eury yeer dissesis nue, Within our bodies dayly grue. And yet as our nue fedings change, Diseases com which aer so strange: We can not naem them in their fraem, Nor seek remedy for the saem. Som dye that neuer semeth sick, Som liue and would be buried quick: Their payns they are without redres, We can not eury greef expres. That riseth of our riots great, And surfets that we taek of meat: The Plowman haeth no fear of that, Though that the Spyder and the Gnat. Within his house thear pleasuer taek, The Gowt doth seldom him awaek: He lets the Spyder kyll the flye, And from the Gowt full saef doth lye. When that the Gentill man is fayn, The corssed Gowt for to retayn. A DOLLFVLL Discours of two Straungers, a Lady and a Knight.

With whom he ioynd, a hazard great, his lyking led him soe: That neyther fear of frowning Gods, nor dreed of earthly woe. Could maek him slayn his plighted troeth, such constant mynd he baer: For which this second Phenix may, with Turttell true compaer. But well away, alas for woe, his grief thearby began: In prince displeasuer throw this prank. fell loe this faithfull man. And Cesar frowning on the faet, thear was nonother boet: But flye the realm or prostraet fall, full flat at Cesars foet. O staets by this com lern to stoup, Note.no stoutnes can preuayll: When from the heauens storms do bloe, and striketh down your sayll. From thonder cracks boeth man and beast. yea Sun and Moen doth flye: The earth and all that liues belowe, doe fear the ratling skye. Wh? Gods aer moued, in souring clowds. lyek dusky mantels black: The troubled aire to mortall men, doth threaten ruen and wrack. I turne my talke from such discours, and treat of that tormoyll: Which long this Knight and Lady felt, at hoem in contrey soyll. And some what of the caers a broed, that he perforce did taest: I mean to wryt so that as troeth, my verses be embraest. For troeth and tyme that tries out gold, hath tempred so my talk: That pen nor mues no pleasuer taeks, on doutfull ground to walk. Now whan these staets with links of loue, wear tyde together fast: And many a sad and heauy thought, between them boeth had past, Of Princes grace and fauour great, (to which regard they toek: As chiefest thing and only cause) wheron they ought to loek. They wayd in ballance of their brests, what sittest serud their corns: And lyek as wood taeks flaem of fier, and so to synders borns. So throw the heat of this mishap, they felt such sorrowe thoe: As though hard deastnye swoer they should, consuem them selues with woe. The Lady lost her fredom streight, the Gods had so decreed: Her knight by sodain flight a broad, maed vertue of a need. And liuing thear with lingring hoep, in forrain contrey strange: Whear absence might throw present toyes, in some men worke a change. He stoed as ferm as marble stoen, and kept boeth troeth and tutch: To her who found few friends at hoem, and harts diseas was mutch. Yea though this Knight with offers great, and treasuer tempted was: (As they full well can witnes bear, who sawe those matters pas) Yet small acount of Fortuen nue, he maed for still in brest: Was shryend the saynt, that stoeny wals, and pryson had possest. No feer nor frynd nor fellow maet, this troylus mind might moue: This Fawcon scornd to pray abrod, at hoem he left his loue. Full many a sigh and heuy loek. he sent a long the Seas: And wysht him self in fetters fast, to doe his Lady eas. What grief of mynd and torment strang, she suffred all the whyell: Is knowen to thoes that bondaeg feels, whoes frynds aer in exiell. Could mischief fawll on boeth the syeds, moer harder than hit did: The oen from ioye and worldly pomp, in preson cloesly hid. The other forst by fatall chance, to seek his fortuen out: And shonning danger found dispayre, in wandring world about. But wayeng well a subiects staet, and what was dueties bounds: He yeelded streight to open harms, for fear of secret wounds. And ventring lyef, yea lands and goods, to keep his naem from blot: (And to requit with hazards hard, the loue that he had got.) From Spayn with speed he did retorn, and setting foet on land: He put his cause in iustice doem, and noble Princis hand. Though in the yoek with fre consent, the humble hart did fall: The heauens stoed so out of tuen, he gaet no grace at all. And clapped vp full fast in hold, a prysnars part he playes: Whear gryepping griefs and greuous groens, consuemd his gladsom dayes. Whyels he a loef full long remaynd, and out of daunger crept: The dolfull Dame in deepe dispayre, his absence soore he wept. Yet great regard to promise paste, shee had as world well wist: And therefore often wrong her hands, when that her knight she mist. But now beganne the boystrous blastes, to blow in bloudy brest: And now the golfe of sighes and sobbs, burste out with great vnrest. For loe, one house helde both these wights, yet both a sonder were: And both in like displeasure stoode, yea ech of both in feare. Of Princes wrath and worlds disgrace, a heauy tale to tell, A plague past hope of heauens blisse, a torment and a hell: That is without redemption sure, but what should more be said: Thus vnder locke and barred doores, these Iuewels safely laid. They must abide the happie houre, that God appoints in skies: And drincke vp water sweete or sowre, or what shall hap to ries. The prison than did pleade their case, the walles both deaffe and dom: Did showe by sines of freedome goone, what sorrowes wear to come. The shrecking Owle in silent night, at window clapt his winges: To threaten death or badde successe, of sondrie doubtfull thinges. No ioyfull sounde was heard with eare, no newes of happie yeares: No pleasure to the pinched harte, in prison strong appeares. Note.Admit the Lute with toutch of hande, a heauie domp doth shoe: A coelling comfort Musicke brings, to wretches wrapt in woe. No myrth with mourning moen may match, for mischiefe measure lacks: And care consuems the minde of man, as fire melts Uirgin Waxe. In silly Sell, and seurall place, these two estates did sit: Whose comming out did farre surmount, the compasse of their wit. As long they spent their tickle time, in teen and terror great: So oft God wot of matters hard, in head did hammers beat. Now hoping that the clouds would calme, and storms would stand at stay: Than looking whan the Planets tornde, their course another way. But shaken shipps in seas do sincke, when surgis ries aloft: And vnder waues (for want of ayde,) weake vessels welter oft. So that no hope of succour seemes, to come when tempests rage: Except the Gods draw backe the plagues, and winde and weather swage. The present panges and parlous thoughts, that pearceth troubled minds: Is knowne to none but such I say, that lacke of freedome finds. A prisner beares a simple port, Note. most glad to pleas and plye: As subiect to the keepers becke, and iellouse Geillors eye. Now trasing out a wearie walke, now whisht and quiet stands: Now downe on knees, now to the cloudes, loeks vp with streatched hands. Now listning after happie newes, now nipt with sorrows old: Now sore abasht and broughte in mues, now mirrie stout and bold. Now riepe and reddie for to speake, now dumme and dare not store: Now fearefull of ech sodaine sounde, and clap of eurye dore. Now bent to beare and suffer wrong, now full repoesd on right: Now faine to fawne on feeble folke, now setting all thinges light. These pashons stil awakes their spreets, that careful captiues are: Such smart they taste, such breade they bite, that feeds on loues of care. Yea some are sarud with chaunge of meates, yet touch they nere a dishe: But sits like Tantalus in hell, and wants what moste they wishe. These twaine I troe were not so vsde, but yet when best they sped: On heauy morssells mixt with mone, their hongrie stomacks fed. No daye stoode free from Fortunes foile, no houre but norrisht fear: No season serude to salue the soers, of sooking sorrow thear. No drincke could coole the furie hot, of thraldoms thirsty throte: No pleasaunt Uerse nor dittie fraemde, to dollors dollfull note. No booke nor storie might reuiue, their drowping dead delite: For from the thoughtes of thirled hartes, are pleasures banisht quight. To slowth, to sleepe and mirthlesse moods, their dompishe dayes enclinde: As from the clue of worldly cares, should threed of life vntwiende. Dispiesd the night, abhord the day, and hated houre of birth: Thought skorne of foode &amp; cleane forsoke, the pleasures of the earth. Would faine haue lost both speach &amp; breath, and loekt when hartes would burst: Beleeude they were in mothers wombe, or els in cradell curst. Though drousie dreede, did death desire, and griefe sought quick dispatch: There was no parting from the place, till daye dischargde the watch. Wee cannot paye our borrowde breath, before thappointed howre: The ende of strife nor staye of state, standes not in peoples powre. The Gods that guides the heauens hie, in secrete doth beholde: The fine, and fleeting feeble course, of earth and massie molde. The hart may heaue the breast may bloe, the body sighe and swelt: The face by open sines may show, of priuie pashons felt. But all these stormes haue litle force, to ridde mans wretched dayes: As by these parties plaine I proue, throw torment sondrie wayes. Well those from whom y? Gods restraine, the skope and vse of will: Must bende the backe and bowe the ioynts, to beare the burthen still. And yet no toile nor griefe so great, but finds at length some eas: There followes after swelling flouds, a quiet calmie Seas. By meane of suite and labours long, and gracious Prince in deede: A sweeter soile these prisnars found, that better bloud did breede. But kept a part as Fortune shapt, and so in silent shade: (As place and time did licence graunt) a fresh complaint they made. Of croked chaunce and straung exstremes: that sondred faithfull harts: Whose sugred loue was euer mixt, with baell and bitter smarts. And neuer after like to meete, nor set ne eye nor vewe: The one apon the other Lord, a matter mitch to rewe. Long in the broile of this conflict, and battell of the minde: They paste their time with bare beliefe, of better hap behinde. And wearing oute with waylings longe, their weary life God wot, And finding hauen choked vp, where passage should be got. At ancker vnder watch and warde, in tossed barke they laye: From whens there was no quiet means, nor hope to scape a waye. Note.The Lady now for laste farewell, betoke her selfe to teares: And of dispaire in persed brest, a double porshon beares. Her hollow cheeks and daesled eyes, declaerde her death was neere: And bade her keepers to prepare, both shrowding sheete and Beere. For nature did denie her life, her hart was tainted soe: That cankred thought should come ful sone, and make an ende of woe. Her coulour changde her cheerefull lookes, and countnaunce wanted spreet: To sallow ashes turnde the hue, of beauties blossoms sweete. And dreery dulnes had bespred, the wearishe body throw: Ech vitall vaine did flat refuse, to do their dutie now. The bloud forsoke the wonted course, and backward gan retyre: And last the lims as cold and swarfe, as coells that wasts with fyre. The moisture taken from the tree, Note. the leaues drops downe apace: When sap dries vp and faills the roote, the branches loes their grace. Some bowes you see do flourish fayre, and groes a goodly height: And some by frost and cold ayre nipt, and so are blasted streight. As eury fruite and floure in field, do yeld to sodaine claps: So all that breathes with liuing soule, are subiect to mishaps. How should this dame desire to liue, that hourely wore away: Who would not shedde some teares to see, this tender twig decay. What stony hart could suffer more, and bere with eeuen hand: The weary weight of worldly woes, and whiske of whipping wand? And when she saw her houre aproch, and death his dutie craue: And she amid her chiefest prime, must go to greedy graue. She toke of worlde a noble leaue, and calling for a frende: (Who liueth yet and can report, how she did make her ende) She saide with loude and comely voice, O world I thee forsake: I haue bin here a pilgrime longe, and now my leaue I take. Of all thy Pompe and pleasures vaine, that makes my sences blinde: Whose glorie doth beginne with paine, and ends with griefe of minde. In dongon deepe of deinty thoughts, thou holdest eurye wight: And feeds their foolish fancies still, with toyes and trifles light. Thy prisnar was I borne to be, and Adams children all: (Like captius here condemde to die) must suffer for his fall. But nowe the chains and lothsome lincks, that lay on shoulders weake: (And all the bands and cloggs of care) in sheuers small shall breake. And I from cage shall mount to skies, more swift than bird with winge: And flicker like a simple doue, where shining Angels singe. I bringe a badge and liurye both, that my good maister CHRIST: Did leaue for such as beares his Crosse, through foggs of worldly miest. Yea shaking of, this sinfull soile, me thincke in Cloudes I see: Amonge the perfite chosen Lambs, a place preparde for mee. Here is no home nor harbring house, but cabbens built on sande: That eurye pirrie puffeth downe, or still on props doth stand. Our Fathers spreetes posses in peace, the countrie that wee craue: We are but strangers far from hoem, that nothing certayn haue. These wear her words and many moe, which follows as she spoek: I dyd (qd she) by bryttell lyfe, O Lord, thy wrath prouoke, For which I now repent me soer, and trusting to receaue, Free pardon for my former fautes, ear sowll shall body leaue. My faynt and feble vessayll frayll, so fears thy Iustice great: That hyt appealls from curs of law vnto thy mercy Seat. I am but worms meat wel I wot, all Fleash is nought but gras: To Earth and ashes out of hand, must all my pleasures pas. I want the force, thou hast the myght to stryue with Death and Hell: Thou art the Rock, the corner Stoen, the Fountayne and the Well. From whom the Springs of lyfe must and vnto whom again The thyrsty soulls, and hongry Harts: for help do trodg a mayn. Who hath byn washed in thy Blood, is whiter than the Snoe: O let the streams and floed of grace, with fauour on me floe. In Booke of lyfe, let wryt good Lord, my name among the rest: That ordaynd wear, ear world was made, to sleepe in Abrams brest. Blot out the bleamish of my brow, that at the latter day: May strike the conshens with dispayre, and cloked crimes be wray. Gyue boldnes to the bashfull sprite, that fears from hens to flitte: Make hope and fayth now ferm to see, great God in glory sitte. Note.With closed hand than brest she knockt, so gaue a sighe and stayd: And then conceiud some inward ioy, with cherefull face she sayd. Do mourne no more O trembling soule, that knowes not wher to staye: Come from the kaytiffe carrayue corps, and cabben made of claye. And looke vpon the Lamb of God, whose death thy randsome payd: That blessed babe the virgins Sonne, that borne was of a mayd. Come silly byrd out of the den, where naught but darknesse is: And looke on euerlasting light, and louing Lord of blis. The lusts of flesh and worldly pomp, I hope are quentcht in me: Throw faith a lone from sin and bond, I haue escaped free. And with that word in sine of ioye, a Salme full loud she sange: The sollemp noyes and sound therof, thorowout the chamber range. And ending that to prayer streight, of her own mind she fell: The standers by whose teares burst out, at this her last farwell. Began to giue her comfort than, of life and welfare both: Yea liue I shall and do right wel, qd she I know for troth. But that is in a nother world, the hope of this is gon: And reason is it should be so, for here there liueth none. But sees the vainnes of our state, and tastes such torments still: That sondry tymes, they wish them selues, from hence with right goodwill. Heare is but toyle and sweate of browes. and endles labour found: And nothing reapt but wretched wrak, and broken sleepes vnsound. Where I shall go I seace from payne, and so such ioye posses: As heart skarce thinks nor head conceiues, nor tongue may well expres. Than hold your peace, knit vp your talke, and trouble not the spreet: That drawes from hence and hopes it is, for better place more meet. A Lady thoe that vertue lykte, and there some credit had: Replyed and sayd O noble dame, in deed you are to sad. These panges shall passe, these fits shal fade, and all these pashons dye, As they haue done whan you full oft, in such like sort did lye. O Madam speak no moer of that, my tyme draws on (qd shee) I shal not dye, but make exchange, of breath and lyfe I see. The Glas is run, the clock wyll stryke, Death doth aproch a pace: My cours is don, the Iudge draws neer, to syt apon my cace: No longer heere I may abyde, the packing day is come: Death byds me now vnarm my selfe, and heere the mortal drom. That calls me hence, as naked suer, as to the world I cam: The cours of Nature shoes me to, that earth and dust I am. The Harrold of long home is sent, to Sommon me in hast: Than stay me not for in that poynt, boeth tears and words ye wast: Yet ear I part, good friends (qd shee) behold what hoep I haue: And note what fayth and badge of Christ, I cary to my graue. And marke, how I confesse with mouth, that Christ hath shed his Blood For me, and those that earst in staet, of deepe damnation stood. And by his Pashon I am sau'd, and not by my dezarts: But by the help of him that knowes, the thoughts of secret harts. Now staying heere, she loekt about, and to a Knight she spaek: And him desired with humble words, that he the paynes would take: To show the prynce what past her mouth O tell him syr quod she: This is the sute and last request, that must be made by me. Unto his highnes whose estate, our blessed Lord maintaine: And pray him to forgeue me now, for I confesse hit playne. I made a fault, and sore offence? when I against his will: Estrang'd my self from his good grace, for any hope or skill. But from my byrth vnto this day, my hart and thought was cleer: From breach of subiectes duetie sure, and I protest it heer. I neuer ment nor purpoesd yet, in worde in deede nor thoght: No harm (nor lodgd one yll consayt, nor spark of euell soght) To hym as God may witnes bear, to that which nowe I speak: Saue nowe alas by ouersight, of feble fancies weak. I feell and fynde the pryce therof, and suffer for the saem: An open check and priuey plaeg, and pyntching publik blaem. I hoep his hyghnes haeth forgoet, the fault I dyd commit: And as he is a noble Prince, in regall throen to sit. And iudge his subiects causis all, so hoep I of his grace. He wyll receyue my chyldren poer, and help thear heauy cace. O God forbyd for mothers fault, the chyldren shuld a bye: No grayn of grodg, nor ground of gyell, in gyltles baebs doth lye. I do bequeath them nowe ? she, vnto the Princis hands: In hoep the fauour that they fynd, shall eas the fathers bands, My nature shoes a moorning cheer, to part from them God knoes: For chyldren fynd small comfort heer. whan hens the mother goes. If God moue not the Princes mind, to pitie thear estate: Note.Now as this Lady dyd at large, about her baebs debate. Uppon her deer boght Iewel than, she cast her only thoght. Yea for whose sake and great good wyll she was in troble broght. And pawsing on this matter throwe, a heuy syghe she gaue. O good sir knight sayd she to one, a thyng of you I craue. Comm?d me to my worthy frend, and byd hym comfort take: And hoep in God and Princes grace, thogh I do world forsake. He may do wel and fredom get: but me ye shall not meet: Tyll from the caue of pampred fleashe, departs his gronyng spreet. Whyles lyfe I had I honord him, and safly kept my vowe: As lyfe dyd bynd me his in all, so death doth lowse me nowe. From hym and all my worldly ioyes, but thogh my frend I leaue. On hye whear dwels a greater frend, (if hoep not me disseaue.) I trust to se his baebs and hym, and thogh much greef hit is: To leaue them heer in bitter baell, yet noet I goe to blis. Whear is no mind of combros caers, nor cause of sorowes known: O tell hym that aboue I hoep, theas storms shalbe oer blown. And as a skrowll is lapped vp, yea so shall all thyngs heer: (When sowlt shalbe immortall maed) vnto our vewe a peer. No soener of the sowll she spoek, but soddayn chang began: In loeks and lyms of deadly shoe, with collor paell and wan. The eyes dyd staer the body streatch, the strength and force dyd fayll: The teeth they chattred in the cheeks, A right figure of Death. the hands dyd quaek and quayll. The mouth dyd [illeg.] the head dyd shaek, the fleashe hyt quiured fast: The feet waxt cold the face dyd sweat, full swyft the [illeg.] past. The hart dyd heaue and beat in brest, A pattern of death.the breath lyk earth dyd sent: At eares and nose the styeffled goest, and vittall lyfe soght vent, Thogh gasping breath broght pashons on, and gript her hart full hard: Yet showd she throw thoes sharp assaultes, to frend a great regard. And callyng for a bore of ryngs, among them choes she won: In which was set by conning aert, a ritch and preshoes ston. Hold carry this ? she good Syer, to my deer noble Knight: He can remember what that stoen, presentes vnto his sight: The other token that I send, hit is a weyghty ryng: Best lykt and derest boght God wot, of any earthly thyng. And when ye shall gyue hym this gyft, desyer hym well to mynd: The lyttell imps the pretty soules, the baebs I leane behynd. And byd hym bryng them vp in fear, of God and Prince I saye: Loe that is al I do requier, of hym my dyeing daye. I haue no gold to send my baebs, but blessing I them gyue: Which God c?fyrm with grace good stoer, As long as they shall lyue. O yet thear is another ryng, which loe my loue must se: Whear is my picture: death I mean, and tell my friend from me, That I as cold and sensles toe, shalbe in littell space: As is that shadoe dom and deaff, and spreetles shaep of face. This don she tornd her hed a syed, and baed them all faerwell. Twear good quod she in syen of death, I hard the passyng bell, For sutch as lyue may pray the whiel, and knoe when bell doth towll. Into the bowells of the earth, the boddy partts from sowll. Yet meet they shall when trumpet sownds and that the dead aryes. And boeth together shall assend, I hoep to starry Skyes. Wyth this began the battayl feers, betwen her lyef and death. Lyek goest she lay, whyells hart dyd groen, and mouth gaept wyed for breath. Than sayd she Lord in to thy hands, I doo commend my spreet. And so her self cloes'd vp her eyes, and hyd her head in sheet. And went away lyk enfantt yong, clean voyd of storm or raeg. Or lyk a boddy fawlls a sleep, that can not speak for aeg. Thus breathles laye this Lady nowe, lyk weyghty lomp of claye, (That earst had lyef and feelyng force) and past lyk flowre a waye. But whan the nues of this was broght, vnto her playffeers eares: Wich roering voyce and blobbred eyes, thear goeshed owt sutch teares, That wytnest well with owtward syens, what woe he felt within. And truely told when she dyd end, his doller dyd begin. Bereft of sleep, and roebd of rest, he roemed vp and down, And cast of weeds of worldly pomp and clapt on moornyng gown. No eas nor pleasures could posses, nor feell the taest of meat. Resolud to pyen and starue him self, his greefs they wear so great, No councell could him comfort long, and styll aloen he drue, To morn and moen to howll and crye, and make complaynt a nue. And worn away with wofull syghes, when sorrow helped not. At leyngth the lyef must be sustaynd, with som releef ye wot. But howe he takes this mischeef yet, and howe the matter goeth: Hyt passeth farre my reatch and wyt, to iudg I tell you troeth, His Lady gon as you haue hard, when dayes and yeeres wear spent In thraldom long, yet after that, was better fortuen sent. For in to princes grace again, he cam by blessyd chance: And so he lyus in open world, whear vertue may aduance: Both him and many thousands moer, that noble lyues doo lead, And wyesly walk with vpright mynds, and stepps of honour tread. Loe heer you Daems of hy renown, a Ladyes death set owt: Whoes lyef for fayth full feaw shall fynd, that seeks wyed world abowt. To God and Prince repentant suer, to world a myrrour bryght: Whearfoer with tong and true report, resownd her prays a ryght. FINIS. Syr Symon Burleis Tragedie, who liued in the xi. yeer of King Richard the second. Loke Frozard the last part. Fo. 108. Am I of blud, or yet of byrth so base, O Baldwin now, that thou forgetst my name Or doth thy pen, want cunning for that case. Or is thy skill, or sensis fawllen lame, Or dost thou feare, to blase abrode my fame: O show sume cause, wherfore I sit in shade, And why is thus, my Tragedy vnmade. Who thinkes great skorne, in silence still to sleepe, And one whose fall, a world may waile and weepe Did Bocace liue, or Lidgate wright again, Some hope were left, my lantern shuld haue light If any one, that had a Poettes vayne. Knew halfe my life, or had my cace in sight, In collors fyne, I should be painted right. But gaping graue, and gnawing wormes below, Snapt Bocace vp, and Lidgate long ago And Poettes sleepe within Parnassus mount, Wher lo of me, they make but smale accounte. O Bawldwin yet, what blot was in my brow, That made the blush, or feare to writ my fall: With what off?ce, can world cum charge me now That I may not, for Baldwins fauour call. Yea durst I claime, the helpe of Poettes all, I daught their skill, could skarcely show in dede, In this behalfe, the cunning that doth nede. Well Baldwin well, if hedeles men might chide, I know what check, &amp; blame shuld Balwin bide. How couldst thou reade, in storyes any while, And so skip oer, my life and destney straunge: Thou knowst, how hap, one me full long did smile. And that my state, stood free from dout of chaunge, I spronge not forth, of such a simple graunge: That I should dwell, in dust from mynde of men, Whilst others are, set out by arte of pen. Thou dost me wrong, wherfore the wound to heele (That sloth hath made,) To Churchyard I appeele Let him be iudge, of all my doinges throw, Syr Simon Burley complaines to him that knows what sorow meanes. Let him vnfould, my fortune sweete or sower: Yea vnto him. I tell my sorowes now. Whose resteles hande, is writing euery hower, And so I leaue, the Baldwin in thy bower. Of lawrell leaues, where thou maist sit and see, At open vew, what Churchyard writes of mee. But erre he takes, in hand this worke of myne: I tell my tale, with weping blubbring eyen. Geue eare good frind and here what I shall say, Noet. And for the while, set all affaires aside: But suer I feare, to short I finde the day. To show my grefe, that hardely can I bide, Yet throw I go, and hope with happy tide. Though haples wind hath blow? my barke about, And daungers deepe, did driue my dayes in dout. Since calme is cum, and quiet ease I haue: Heare his complaint y? late crept out of graue. How should I speake, that houlds my head in hand Though dead men speak not there is a meane to vtter griefes by degrees.(Which s?celes skalpe, both life &amp; speach hath lost) Yet out of brest, though hedles here I stand. I may blase forth, y? greues of groning goste: As from the seas, that is with torments toste. Coms roring neyes, when calmes ful quiet are: So breath I out, from brest my broyling care. Though head be of, a smoking fume procedes, From quaking neck, &amp; gushing vaines that bledes. Heare him I say, whose bowels speakes alone, And wants in dede, both vse of tunge and wit: Heare him that must, by arte cum make his mone. And lackes therfore, the members meete and fit, Heare him that grones, &amp; howles from hollow pit. Here him whose voice, doth giue a fearfull sownd, Heare him that long, lay rotten in the ground. Here him whose plainte, may pearse y? lofty skyes, And for thy ayde, and english versis cryes. As naked suer, as he was lapte in shete, With deadly lookes, and grisely staring hare: Not like a man, but like a monstrus sprete. Sent from the pit, to whisper in thyne eare, And make the muse, of world an other where. No freindes nor birth can bere of mischaunceFor here as tyme, doth softly steale away, So life and lande, and all thinges doth decay. No birth nor blud, nor flocks of frends preuayles, Wh? sturdy storms, strikes down our stately sails The ship must sway, aside or sinck in seas, That shaken is, with shocking surges still: The grenest gras, y? grows in goodliest leas. To partching heat, must yeld by reas?s skil, A man dayly assaulted with sorows, yeldes of force to distruction. What stone can stay, y? rowlith down y? hil. What fote can stand, y? fortune dayly trips, What liuing wright, can skape her skorging whips, No soner out of shell or mothers lap: But subiect straight to sorow and mishap. The life y? sume, most sweetly do embrace, To trobled teares, doth turn or we be ware We are in loue, with fond Narcissus face. And dround our selues, in y? wher? we stare And fede the flesh, so long with daintie fare. That belly swelles or stomack belchith vp, One plage ouerthrows many pleasures. The liquor sweet, y? came from spiced cup. One daies disgrace, doth brede an endles sore: And payse vs [illeg.]me, for all thinges past before. Yet climing vp the tree of tickell trust, We streache the arme, as far as reach may go: Disguisd with pompe, and pampred vp with lust. We gase aloft and neuer lokes belo, Till the falling blow be geuen, the tree on triumph standeth. Till hatchet cumes, and giues the fawling blo. Then crack it cryes, and all in shiuers flyes, That many a day, was mounting to the skyes. One stroke throws downe, a thousand bowes withall, And such as clyme, are crusht by sodayne fall. Was I not one, that in toppe Galland stode And bare great sway, w? him y? ruld y? roste: Was not my house, sprong out of g?tel blud And was not I, long time in fauor most: Syr Simon brought vp at skole vvith the pr?ce of vvales &amp; Acquitaine.Yes sure I was, and therof make I boste. At skole broght vp, w? prince of pereles race A playfeere long, with him in euery place. My childhode wan, such loue &amp; liking great, That in mine age, I sat in Senate seate. Was not my sier, about a king estemde, And highly plast (wherbi he purchast praise) And nere the king, in fauour as it semde. Into Galatia to c?duct Don Petro king of Castill, Syr Simon vvas sent as one of chefeest for that purpose.Yea mutch made of, ful l?g before my daies Was not I sent, Embaster sundry wayes. And did not I, my dewtie euery hower, With paine &amp; purce, as far as stretcht my power. The world wel knows, what seruice I haue done, And by the same, what honor I haue wonne. My manhode made, mine enemyes fly like shepe, He appeased an vprore in the citie of London.(Before the Wolfe that watcheth for his pray) My wisdom did, in peace the commons kepe. Wh? Iohn of Gaunt, they wold haue made away, My presence oft could quiet many a fray. My councel coeld, the rage of retchles heades. My stoutnes sarud, the state in sundry steades. My noble mynd, could neuer take no rest, For publike wealth, I had such burning brest. In Poiteou long, agenst the French I was, Where frontier warre, I hild and did full well: He wan victory in a valiant fight, &amp; yet comming home vvas taken prisoner. And as I did throw many a perell passe: At comming home, in enemyes hands I fell, And when in dede, my prince therof hard tell. He sory was, and spake of me much good, But as these thinges in weight &amp; ballaunce stood; Our Souldiers toke, a Duches of great fame, Who at that tyme, of Burbon bare the name. The Souldiors swore, that she shuld neare be free, The Duches of Burbon prisoner &amp; did raunsom syr Symon Burley. (Nor see her Sune, nor fynde a sparke of grace Nor loke for hope) till she had raundsomd mee. And set me safe, in good and quiet cace: Lo what regard they had, in euery place. Of me those dayes, lo how I was all height, Lo how I was, employd in thinges of weight. At home embrast, abrode wel likt with all, Yea lou'd and feard, among both great and small. When forraene frinds, did send for succor here, One Paskall vvas sent from the king of Nauar hether for succor, &amp; king Richard made Syr Simon ansvvere the Embasdor, therle of Salisbury &amp; other in presence. King Richard baed, me aunswer make therin: In presence then, there stode a greater peere. But I was he, that did the fauor win: To speake and thus, me creadit did begin. And still increace, as one whose lampe in deede, Cowld want no oyle, the blase and flame to feede. My Candell blasde, so cleere, as star by night: And where I came, the torche gaue littil light. King Richard sent him to c?clude a mariage &amp; the duke of Tasson vvas sent hether vvith Syr Simon from the King of Beam and Almaine about this matter.And when the king, for causes good &amp; great, Deuisd to match with one beyond the seas: Twas I was thoght, most fit to work y? feat And in this case, the king I did so please. Of marriage ther, y? knot was knit w? ease, And so fr? thence, a Duke was s?t with me: For this behalf, the state of thinges to see. Thus stil I was emploid in great affaires, As hap her self, had hald me vp her staires. An office here, I had of great renowne, He was lord Chamberlayne.A place nere prince, and stil in court to be: That might c?maund, the people vp &amp; down And thrust th? out, or cal them in to me. Bad I th? run, one flocks then wold they fle Bad I them stand, in dede they durst not sit: I swayd them all, as horse is rulde by bit. I bare in hand, the stafe y? kept the sturr: And knokt their pates, y? prest to neer y? dur. Lord warden loe, of y? sinck parts I was, And captaine both, of Douer Castel tho: Throw lordly roumes, &amp; places I did passe, As easely sure, as man can wish to go. I knew no ebbe, my tide did dayly flo: VVher fortune smiles, the world fawnes.I kept the trayne, I had y? liuely trope, I held vp head, I neuer thought to drope. I went no where, but I was wayted on, And shone in pompe, like perle or precious stone. Amonge the chiefe, yea chiefest was I helde My Prince preferde, me so for vertues sake And what he sawe, I able was to welde Fauour giues more preferments than m? can honestlye craue. I had, for which, I seldome sute did make I stoode beneath, whilst he did appulls shake Into my lap, when lest I lokt therefore As some what came, so daily followed more By heapes as though, great mounts of massie gould, To my most neede, should aunsweare what I would. The flodds of wealth, that doth refresh the minde With gladsome thoughts, of threefold sweete delight Wealthe glads the greedie minde. Came gusshing in, against both tide and winde On which faire baites, eche fishe desires to bite A carelesse eye, I cast, of worlds dispight That spurnes at such, that fortune liftes alofte A wicked worme, that waites on worship ofte A swarme of wasps, that vseth nought but stinge On those that ries, and rules about a kinge. O hateful flyes, ye hatcht of wretched brode On eurye dishe, in haste ye blow and humme Spitefull people are hateful flies. O cankred men, of vile and noughtie mode You do infeckt, all places where you cumme You make small shoe, yet sounde as shrill as drumme In peoples eares, and still your poison restes On noble mindes, and tender harmeles brestes Ye mallice much, the hie and mightie sort To kill good name, by bruite of false report. If poore men rise, in fauour any way The world rather doth w?der at the wel doings of many that deuise to get glory by vertue.The ritche repines, to see howe they are plaest As hounds do barke, that houlds the Bucke at bay The people prate, and spende much speache in waest Looke saith the lewde, on newe start vp in haest Looke who rules now, loke what this man hath founde Looke how in lappe, doth Fortunes ball rebounde They looke not how, to clime for vertues sake But how of world, they may a wonder make. Poore &amp; riche haue loftie minds &amp; poute &amp; svvel at other m?s good fortunes.So loftie minds, with lothsome lowring lookes Saluts the good, that growes in Princes grace And watcheth close, in corners and in nookes How they by wiles, the worthy may deface No marueile sure, it is a common case To heare them snarre, whose natures are not like What Greiund can rest, by currish countrie tike? What Hawke can sit, in peace for carraine crow? What tongue can scape, the skolding of a shrow. The dolt disdaines, the deepe wise man ye wot Disdaine am?g al sorts of people and creatures.The blunt abhorrs, the quicke sharpe witte in deede The coward hates, the hande that conquest got The Iade will wince, to stande by storing steede The glotten gronts, to see the hongrie feede Thus thinges from kinde, so farre can neare agree No more then can, the catte and dogge you see As choise is greate, of wealth and worldly goods Men differ much, in maners and in moods. One Iewell staines, an other very farre And strife there is, in mettals grosse and fine Strife there is in mettalls, stones, flovvers, and Planets. And sondrye luckes, belongs to euery starre And Planets to, they saye that can deuine One race and bloud, do seldome draw one line A graine of grudge, is sowne so deepely heare That nothing scarce, can scape from mallice cleare Thus mallice makes, a murmure where it goes And strikes out right, yet giues but secret blowes. The greedie gnat, and priuie eating mothe Disdainfull heads are mischeuous moths that eate vp good clothes. A monster small, that skarce is felt or seene Lies lurking still, in plaits of finest clothe And little wormes, whilst nutts are freshe and greene Crepes in and eates, the kirnell as I weene So vnto them, compare these peuishe pates That on small cause, do enuie great estates Yea enuie oft, is coutcht and clokt as cleane In mightie folke, as found amonge the meane. The flasshing flames, that from great fornayes flyes Castes forth such heate, as fewe men can abide Mightye mens mallice comparde to flashing flames. The rage whereof, doth dimme the daintie eyes And breedes great griefe, before the harme be spide Much mischiefe coms, by pranks of powting pride Which puffes and blowes, as it woulde mountaines moue And growes at first, on nought but lacke of loue Whose spitefull sparks, doth spare no speach nor time (Nor practize leude) to plucke them downe that clime. Enuie is a monster am?g m?.This enuie is, a mightie monster greate That swims like Whale, amonge the litle frie Whose gaping mouth, would soone consume and eate The Gogions small, that in small corners lye His thirstie throte, would drincke all places drye And sucks vp all, and so of all leaues nought Which should serue all, if all did bere one thought O hungrie flye, that would be all in all And maggots brings, when men for feeding call. With drosse &amp; grauell greate flouds be choked vp.As greatest flouds, most grauell do retaine And strongest tides, runnes oer the weakest walles So hiest states, do nourrishe most disdaine And at rebounde, striks out the tennis balles Yea they who thinckes them furthest of from falles Are watching still, in Court, in field or towne Like stombling stockes, to trip their fellowes downe And none do striue, and struggle for the gooles But such as haue, their harts most full of hooles. Dissemblers the deuils dere darlinges the onely workers of wickednes.Yea heapes of them, are harbred here and theare In golden haules, that shines like Phebus bright Where flattrers flocke, who tattles in the eare A thousand lyes, that neuer coms to light They worke the waxe, with fire both day and night They spin the webbe, that takes the folishe flie They baite the hoke, that bleres the simple eye They shoue them out, that should be called in They make the match, that doth the wager win. And they breede strife, where all in quiet stode Strife onelye is sovved by foysting fellovves that follovves fortune and playes on aduauntage. They packe the cards, and playe most filthy pranckes They sharpe the sworde, that shedes the giltles bloud Thy leest deserue, and alwayes gets most thankes They feede the streame, that breakes the mightie bankes They are the sheares, that marrs they garment quite They haue the tongues, that spares no speach nor spite They are the babes, still dandled on the knee And those are they, that rottes the soundest tree. If fawners fled, the house of mightie men The giuinge co?tenance to favvners enfects vvith their dissimulation, the hartes of noble men. And mightie folke, would frowne on fawning currs Deceit should shonne, the noble houses then And veluet weedes, should shake of cleuing burrs But storing stedes, are prickt that needs no spurrs Thus palfry flings, and flounceth out of frame That els of kinde, were curteous meeke and tame A iomblinge iobb, doth strike the bowle awrye Which of himselfe, would close on bias lye. For noble bloud, must needs haue noble minde Noblenes abused vvith busy bablers. And flie the gate, of fawcon gentle milde And sure it is, against their noble kinde To play the Kite, and cruell Coistrel wilde Till tatlers come, with tongues full finely filde And cha?ge their modes, and marre their maners cleane They skarce do know, what cankred hate doth meane But when from best, to worst the good are wrought Noblenes is noble of it selfe. By busy braines, all sortes of sleightes are sought. Hatred hales men to vnhappie dealings.Then burnes the breste, as hot as Eathna hill And rage beres rule, where reason dwelt before The hastie heade, is swift to slay and kill The hautie hart, hurds vp much hate in store The altred minde, doth make the mischiefe more The kindled coles, doth crepe in straw so farre That quarrels rise, and peace is turnde to warre One haleth backe, an other drawes aside And weakest bones, must needes the brunt abide. Not one maye be aduanced but either rich or povver enuieth.As I aspierd, by vertue and desarte And was by Prince, cald vnto credite still So some by sleight, did seeke to sucke my harte And of my bloud, did thrist to drincke their fill They sought to stoppe, the water from the mill And turne the wheele, and all the ioynts awrye Lo heare how close, the swelling Serpents lye Loe how they caste, their venom as they maye And marke what hate, they gaine that beareth sway For that I grew full great with Robert Vear A noble man, fall wise and mightie both Therle of Oxforde called duke of Irel?d fauored much sir Simon.And had the guide, of good Prince Edwards hear To show therein, my dutie faith and trothe Great mallice rose, as grudginge daily grothe Twene many men that cannot rule their rage A mightie duke, there was well stept in age That sought to reape, the corne that I had sowne And could not rest, till I was quite oerthrowne. My roulmes and rule, and things that I had goet His office and dignitie made mightie men dispise him. My gaine my wealth, and glory as it grue Was in his eye, so bigge a mightie moet That loe this Duke, my plague did still pursue With open mouth, he so the bellowes blue That sparkes of fier, as thicke flew in my face As in the Sunne, the gnatts do flie at chace Or as the balle, rebounds at euery stroke So loe his words, did smore me vp in smoke. This dreadfull Duke, did driue a wondrous drift The band that the duke made agaist the king The Duke of Yorke, thearle of Salisburye, therle of Ar?dell, therle of Northumberland, therle of Notingham &amp; tharchbishop of Canterburye. To worke his will, with slipper sleight of hande And sought to giue, king Richards frends a lift For whom he did, prepare a secrete bande Whose bolde attempts did trouble all this lande But few could finde, the darnell in the corne Or iudge aright, the Roes from pricking thorne So close in clowde, was clokte their cunning arte That none could know, who plaide the Foxes parte. This Duke did raise, a bruite the king would haue A taxe most straunge, of all the realme throwe out A noble of eurie fier in England vvas the taxe that the noughtie duke said the kinge did demaunde. And to the Lords, and commons councell gaue Against the king, to stand both stiffe and stout This practise proude, was patcht with many a clout Here did the Wolfe, leade silly lammes amis (And suckt their bloud) as woluishe maner is Here traytrous tricks, and trebell trothles traynes In subiects brestes, began to sprede theyr vaines. The Duke of Yorke, and diuers noble peers Forsoke the king, and held with this vprore By which great strife, was sowne in sondry sheres And corsies rose, that made a running sore Bigge biles brust out, where fleshe was sounde before And though some time, the Surgeon salue did finde To heale the wound, (the skarre remaind behinde) A common plague, doth creepe alonge the realme As skulls of fishe, swimmes vp and downe the streame. The Duke caused all the greate tovvnes of England to exclaime on the king ?d his councell.The greatest townes, and Cities of most name As London, Yorke, and many mo beside These Dukes did draw, with folly out of frame And made some striue, against both streame and tide Where bankes be brooke, the water cannot bide Where flouds flee out, the fishe do follow fast And than to late, to call againe is past The Swallow flies, no swifter vnder winge Then mens deuice, that do forsake a kinge. Where faith is broken all abuses enters &amp; falles to fonde attemptes.For faith once stainde, seekes straight for starting holes As prisners doe, that hath their promise broke The seames once ript, of shue farewell the soles The Oxe set free, will seeke to shonne the Yoke The chimney bruste, the house is full of smoke The sleuce drawen vppe, downe driues the dregs and all The strongest tript, the weakest needs must fall There is no stay, to hold meane people in When might with maine, the mischiefe doth begin. The Lords alledgd, the king was gouerd still A lordly rebellion and a rebels presumption to their Prince. By such as came, from base and poore estate And sayd he should, no longer haue his will By which bould speache, there grew so great debate The lande was bent, on murther ruyne and hate Now seuerall wayes, from hiue flew out the bees Now tempests came, and tare vp mightie trees Now traitours flockt, and fell to fackshions straunge Whose fickill myndes, still gaped for a chaunge. O vipars brode, and blody bosome snakes O Butchers curres, that would your maister byte A rebuke for rebels. O helhoundes rude, of Plutos lothesum lakes O cursed crew, more crewell then the Kyte O kankred hartes, so fraught with froward spite O Tigers wilde, O monstrous men most vyle Where was your loue, and dewtie all this whyle How durst you speake, so stoutly to his face To whom of right, the stoutest ought giue place. Among brute bestes, that sauage ar and wilde The Lion raignes, and rules with regall powre Among beasts the Lion is obeyd. Among birdes the Egle Among fishe the Dolphyn. And am?g the smalest Bees a great Bee is their king. And so great birdes, stoupes downe like littill childe (To fathers beck) if Eagle doth but lowre Than to a king, dare people loke so sowre That they will force, their suffraine paste their reatche No scoller ought, his learned tewtor teache No member dare, presume, to rule the hed None raignes and rules, but kynges when all is sed. Make vvhat mischief they come vnto that striue against the streame.Note how they shrincke, that shapes to giue a shocke Against a king, and marke how traitors spede Note how their hedes, do tumble of the block That with vaine hope, do peoples humors fede And note from whence, doth Princes powre procede And note withall, how farre doth stretche his fame And faulters quake, that do but heere his name For at the brunte, saye here a king doth cumme Home runne poore knaues, &amp; down they fling y? drumme. The Londiners being then euil disposed to their king, desired Thomas of VVodstock to take the charge of the citie vp? him.Harke howe this Duke, whereof I spake before By three estates, vnto a coumpt did call Their king and Lorde, whose minde they troubled sore And vexte thereby, his frendes and faures all They fill in lashe, they felt the bluddy brale They loste their goodes, they got a great disgrace They fled the courte, they were pursewd in chace They were full faine, for none offence or cawes At open barre, to plede their cace by lawes. Those that stode vvith right receiued most vvrong and traytors tormented the trevve m? that leste offended.Suche are the happes, of those that hould with right Suche cureles woundes, they haue that sores wold heale Suche hate they heape, in hucksters handes that light Suche harmes they finde, that standes with c?mon weale And such know not, to whom they should appeale When wrong will rule, and reuell faules to spoyle The faithfull flocke, are forste to feele the foyle Drede driues desartes, that daylie well hath dunne To flie from foes, or els throw fier to runne. Because these Lordes, who loekte to lede the daunce The Duke of Glocester and Duke of Yorke vvith other maligned those the king fauored. Saw other step, one stage ere they could ryse By playne fine force, they would themselues aduaunce And for that feate, this drifte they did deuise Desier of fame, doth so abuse the wise They ende like fooles, that erste began full well And sonest smarte, that ringes the larom bell Note. For wheles and all, faules downe about their eares Rebels always beres the blovves. From rotten frames, who first stode voide of feares. But we who were, besigd by fortune so Betraied I meane, if trothe may tell the tale Were skorgd and plagd, and faine to fawne one foe King Richards best frindes vvere by traytors frovvardly handled. And sew to such, as set our liues to sale We were shut vp, they had the bounsing gale That blew their barke, beyonde our compasse cleane With sailes aflaunte, and had no mery meane They clapt on all, and wente throw streme and flud When trew mens fete, stode faste in mier and mud. I was the man, that moste of mischief had I was accusde, and cald to counte in haste I founde moste cause to sighe and sit full sad I was laide vp, and thereby clene disgraste Myn enmies said, I did the treasure waste And held in hand, the Souldiours money to I was so nipt, I knew not what to do My frindes wext fainte, or ferd the like mischaunce But I was he, must leade the dolefull daunce. The Bishop of Canterbury accusde him of sacrilege and c?ueying money ouer the Sea by night to the king of BeameA mitred head, a Bishop bolde and braue Said I conueide, away Saint Thomas shryne And that I mente, the king of Beame should haue The same from me, by priuy practise fyne To hoiste me vp, he laid boeth hooke and lyne And so by frindes, he framd so flat a feate That I was cald, to strait accounte in heate For this and more, a libell long and large (Of forgid faultes, that he laide to my charge. No clarke might come, to make my reckning right No tale could serue, to show my matter throw No depe discource, could bring the trothe to light No man of law, could canues cases now Strong hande did all, I must both bende and bow The king knewe not, of halfe the wrongs I felte Nor none could finde, how finely cardes were delte A pack was made, and one had got the ace Note.And trimly robd, the trumps before my face. No boote to bid, the players deale agayne The game was won, and I had lost the stake These foisters fyen, could nick both by and maine And kog out right, when they the dice did shake And of swete spoyle, a bitter banquet make They cald me in, and I the only geste Was bidden then, vnto this bluddy feeste I was compeld, to taest what dishe they wolde And in great heete, to drinke vp poison colde. I meane my fate, and fortune was so harde I could not scape, their handes that sought my life Who wreackt their wrath, on me without regarde Yet long in sheath, they kept the murthering knife For on my hap, at first rose all this strife And on the frinds, that I by hap had wonne This end I had, and mischief was begonne For taking parte, with such as likt me well To ground full flat, from top of tree I fell. When in the tower, my foes had clapt me faste Few frendes I founde, the world began to winke And so at length, in rerage was I caste And poste alone, was lefte to swym or sinke And iudgement was, as I was forste to thinke That I should paie, twoo hundrith thousand frankes For all my toile, lo here is all my thankes I did posses, my chargis and my losse And paines abrode, came home by weping crosse. And wanting wealth, to paie this heauy summe With billes and glaiues, from prison was I led And so vnto, the Towre hill did I cumme To suffer death, where sone I loste my hed The king knew naught, of this til I was ded Loo people here, how thinges about were brought And what disdaine, and mightie mallice wrought Lo here his ende, and sodaine sliding downe That was both true, to God and to the crowne. As littill twigges, oer toppes of houses grow Whose braunches big, spredes out a mightie tree Or as smale brokes, with seas do swell and flowe Yet hath no powre, to passe their boundes you see Or as faire flowers, that in gay gardins bee Sprouts out awhile, and when they are at height They fade and fall, and then declineth streight So man doth mounte, awhyle on stages hie And at the beste, shottes downe like starre from skie. When thinges are growen, as farre as course is set And haue attaind the fulnes of their state They backewarde come, and can no further get For cleane expierd, ye see is then their date The life we beare, of force must yeld to fate The steppes we trede, weares out by track of tyme When ladder brekes, we can no higher clyme Where Fortune sittes, so faste, doth grynde the mill The whele turns rounde, and neuer standeth still. Long is the toile, or man to triumphe cummes Large is the plot, where we our pagantes play Swete is the sap, and sower are all the plummes That paine pluckes of, the pleasane planted spray Shorte is the tyme, of all our glorie gaye Uaine is the hope, of hazardes here in earth Great are the greues, of life from day of bearth No suerty growes, of all is here posseste All comes to naught, when people feareth leste. Loo what it is to stande on tickell stayes Where hatred heaues, the housholde out of square And when it faules, the ioyntes fle seuerall wayes And ioyfull weights, are cled with wo and care The seruauntes howle, the wyfe and childe is bare The frends wring hands, the foes do laugh and flyer Suche chaunges chaunce, to those that do aspyre The grounde but gaps, who first shall faule therein And who sekes moste, at length the leste may wyn. Loo Churchyarde now, my mirthles tale is tould A mourning verse, prepare thou straight for me And in thy ryme, some stately order hould For that I sprong not out of base degree Let euery lyne, a liuely sentence bee To wake the wittes, of such as world would knoe And liste to marke, how worldly matters goe And when thou comste, to touch the gauled back Leape oer the horse, or vse a ryders knack. Bear euen hande, and holde the bridell right Yet whiske the wande, sometimes for pleasures sake Yea spice thy speache, and tearmes with trifels light That lokers on, may not thy mynde mistake When store is gone, yet do thy budget shake Among the best, and feede their fansies still No matter though, a mouse crepe out of hill Smale toyes may brede, great sporte in great estates And in great groundes, men walke throw littill gates. Do wisely warne, and warely vse thy pen Speake Englishe plaine, and roue about the but And shote at will, and slante by wicked men Shale out the shell, and bid them crack the nut Showe some delight, and so the sentence shut And bid the world, behold me in a glas That did to rewen, from pompe and pleasure passe Now I am gone, I wyshe the rest behinde (As they desier) may better fortune finde. A TRAGICALL DISCOURSE of the vnhappy mans life. Com courtiars all draw neer my morning hers Com heer my knell, ear cors to church shall go Or at the least, come read this wofull vers And last farewell, the haples penneth so And such as doth, his lief and manners kno Come shed some teares, and se him painted out That restles heer, did wander world about. O pilgrims poer, preace neer my pagent nowe And note full well, the part that I haue playd And wyesly waye, my thriftles fortune throwe And print in brest, eache worde that heer is said Shrinke not my frindes, step forth stand not afrayd Though monstrous hap, I daily heer possest Some sweater chaunce, may bring your hartes to rest. For though the wreatch, in cold and honger lies The happy wyght, in pompe and pleasure sittes The weake fals down, whear mighty folk aries The sound feels not, the feble ague fits So world you wot, doth serue the finest wittes Though dullards doe, in darknes daily run The wyes at will, can walke whear shyens the Sunne. And hap fals not, to eury man a like Some sleeps full sound, yet hath the world at call Some leaps the hedge, some lights a mid the dyke Some sockes the sweat, and some the bitter gawll The vse of things, blynd deastnie gius vs all So though you see, ten thousand souls in hell Yet may you hoep, in heauens blys to dwell. Let my mishap, a worldly wonder be For few can finde, the fruit that I did taest Ne leaus nor bowes, I founde vpon the tree And whear I plowd, the ground lay euer waest A man would think, the child was borne in haest Or out of time, that had such lucke as I For loe I looke, for Larkes when fauls the skye. No soyll nor seat, nor season serues my torn Each plot is sowen, with sorrow whear I goe On mo?tayn top, they say wher torch shuld born I find but smoek, and loethsom smothring woe Neer fountayn hed, whear springs do daily floe Cold Ise I get, that melts with warmth of hand So that I starue, whear cock and condits stand. I quench smal thirst, wher thousands drink &amp; byb An empty cup, I carry clean away And though as lean, as rack is eury ryb And hollow cheeks, doth hidden grief bewray The ritche eates all, the poore may fast and pray No butter cleaues, vpon my bred at need When hongry mawe, thinks throet is cut in deed. The shallow broeks, whear littell penks ar found I shon, and seek, the seas to swymme thear on Yet vessayll sinks, or bark is layd a ground Whear leaking ships, in saefty still haue gon They harber finde, when hauen haue I non Hap cauls them in, when I am lodgd at large Thus plaines creeps, in cold Cock lorels barge. Full thirty yeers, both Court and warres I tryed And still I sought, aquaintaunce with the best And serud the staet, and did such hap abyed As might befall, and Fortune sent the rest When drom did sound, a Souldiour was I prest To Sea or Lande, as princes quarrell stoed And for the saem, full oft I lost my blod. In Scotland long, I lingred out my yeers First at VVark vvith George Lavvson. When VVylford lyud, a worthy wight in deed And thear at length, I fell so farre in breers I taken was, as deastny had decreed Taken vnder the Lorde Admirall at Saynt Mynins. Well yet with woords, I did my foes so feed That thear I lyud, in pleasuer many a daye And skaept so free, and did no randsom paye. Some sayd I found, in Scotland fauour then, I graunt my pomp, was more than reason wold Yet on my band, I sent hoem sondry men That els had pyend, in pryson pyncht with cold To French and Scots, so fayr a taell I tolde That they beleeud, whyt chalk and chees was oen And it was pearll, that proued but pybbull stoen. In Lavvther fort, I clapt my self by sleight Vnder Sir Hue VVyllovvbe. So fled from foes, and hoem to frynds I past The French in haest, beseegd that Fortres streight Then was I like, to light in fetters fast Mounsoer de Terms, besieged this fort. But loe a peace, broek vp the seeg at last When weery wars, and wicked blodshed great Maed both the sydes, to seek a quiet seat. From thens I cam, to England as I might Sir Anthony Sentlyger deputie of Irelande.And after that, to Irlande did I sayll Whear Sellenger, a wyes and noble knight Gaue me such place, as was to myen aduayll Than teasters walkt, as thick as doth the haill About the world: For loe from thence I boer For seruice doen, of money right good sloer, Meatts in Lorain vvon by treason. In Fraunce serued vnder captayne Crayer.Hoem cam I thoe, and so to Fraunce did faer When that their kyng, wan Meatts throw fatchis fien So on the stock, I spent all voyd of caer And what I gaet, by spoyll I held it myen Than down I past, the pleasant floed of Ryen And so I sarud, in Flaunders note the saem Whear loe at first, my hap fell out of fraem. For I was clapt, in pryson without cawse In Charles the fifts time, vnder Captain Matson.And straightly held, for comming out of Fraunce But God did work, throwe iustice of the lawse And help of frindes, to me a better chaunce And still I hoept, the warres wold me aduaunce Got out of prison by helpe of the noble Madame Sell de embry.So trayld the piek, and world began a nue And loekt like hawk, that laetly cam from mue. Three yeer at least, I sawe the Emprours warres Than hoem ward drue, as was my wonted traed Whear Sunne and Moen and all the seuen Starres Stoed on my syed, and me great welcom maed But wether fayre, and flowrs full soen will faed So peoples loue, is like nue besoms oft That sweeps all clean, whyels broem is green and soft. Well oens again, to warrs I drue me fast Eight yeres vnder my Lorde Grey. And with Lord Grey, at Giens I did remayn Where he or his, in any serues past I followed on, among the warlyk trayn And sometime felt, my part of woe and payn As others did, that Cannon well could like And pleasuer took, in trayling of the pike. At length the French, did Giens besiege ye wot And littell help, or succour found we tho By whiche fowll want, it was my heauy lot To Parris streight, with good Lord Grey to goe As prisners boeth, the world to well doth knoe By tract of tyme, and wonders charge in deed He hoemward went, and took his leue with speed. But poest aloen, I stoed alack the whyell And contrey clean, forgot me this is true And I might liue, in sorrowe and exyell And pien away, for any thing I knue As I had baekt, in deed so might I brue Not one at hoem, did seek my greef to heall Thus was I clean, cut of from common weall. Yet loe a shift, to scaep away I founde Oens agayne eskaped out of pryson. When to my fayth, my taker gane no trust I did deuies, in wryting to be bounde To come again, the time was set full iust But to retorn, forsoeth I had no lust Sens faith could get, no credit at his hand I sent him word, to come and sue my band. He came him selfe, to court as I did heer And told his taell, as fienly as he might At Ragland than, was I in Monmouth sheer Yet whan in court, this matter cam to light My friendes did say, that I had don him right A Soldiour ought, vpon his faith to go Which I had kept if he had sent me so. Serued vnder my Lord Grey at Leeth.Well yet my minde, could neuer rest at hoem My shues wear maed, of running leather suer And boern I was, about the world to roem To see the warres, and keep my hand in vre The Frenche ye knoe, did Englishemen procuer To come to Leeth, at siedge wherof I was Till Frenche did seeke, in ships away to pas. A littell breath, I toek than after this And shaept my self, about the Court to be And eury daye, as right and reason is To serue the Prince, in Court I settled me Some frends I found, as frends do go you se That gaue me wordes, as sweet as hony still Yet let me lyue, by hed and conning skill. I croetcht, I kneeld, and many a cap could vayll And watched laet, and early roes at moern And with the throng, I follouwd hard at tayll As braue as bull, or sheep but nuely shoern The gladdest man, that euer yet was boern To wayt and staer, among the staets full hye Who feeds the poer, with many frendly eye. But who can liue, with goodly lookes aloen Or mirry wordes, that sounds like tabrers pyep Say what they will, they loue to keep their own And part with nought, that commeth in their griep You shall haue nuts, they say when ploms aer riep Thus all with shalls, or shaels ye shall be fed And gaep for gold, and want both gold and led. The proef therof, maed me to seke far hens To Anvverp than, I trudged on the spleen And all in haest, to get some spending pens To serue my torn, in seruice of the Queen But God he knoes, my gayn was small I ween For though I did, my credit still encreace I got no welth, by warres ne yet by peace. Yet harke and noet, I praye you if you pleas In Anvvarp town, what fortune me befell My chaunce was such, whan I had past the Seas A Captaine of great charge vnder the Prince of Arrange. (And taken land, and theron rested well) The people Iard, and rang a larom bell So that in aerms, the town was eury whear And fewe or noen, of lief stoed certain thear. A noble Prince, I sawe amyd that broyll To whom I went, and swaer his part to taek The commons caem, all set on raeg and spoyll And gaue me charge, to keep my wyts a waek The Prince for loue, of king and countreis saek Bad me do well, and shed no gyltles bloed And saue from spoyll, poer people and there Good. I gaue my fayth, and hand to do the saem He saued Religious houses and most of the towne from burning.And wrought the best, that I could worke therefoer And brought at length, the commons in such fraem That some wear bent to blo the coell no moer Yet some to rage, and robbry ran full soer Whom I reformd, so that no harm did fall To any wyght, among the commons all. The streets we kept, and braek ne house nor doer And for three dayes, made no mans finger bleed I daer auoutch, that neither ryche nor poer Could say they lost, the valeur of a threed Well what of that, you kno an honest deed Is soen forgoet, of such as thanckles be For in the end, it fared so by me. Note.The town I kept, from cruell sword and fier Did seek my lief, when peace and all was maed And such they wear, that did my blud desier As I had saude, from bloes and bluddy blaed I crept away, and hid me in the shaed But as the daye, and Sun began to shien They followd fast, with force and practies fien. Escaped by Gods helpe out of great daunger.In priests atyer, but not with shauen crown I skaept their hands, that sought to haue my hed A forckid cap, and pleytted corttall gown Far from the church, stoed me in right good sted In all this whyell, ne masse for quick nor ded I durst not sing, a poesting priest I was That did in haest, from post to pyller pas. In Brigges than, the parsons breetch did quake Follovvde by the Marshall 8. dayes. For there a clarke, came tinging of a bell (That in the towne did such a rombling make) I could not walke, in vickars garments well So there I wisht, my selfe in Cockell shell Or Sea mans slopps, that smeld of pitch &amp; tarre Which roebs I found, ear I had traueld farre. A Marshall came, &amp; seartcht our woole fleet than At the Slues' the Marshall and he vvere both in one ship together. In boat I leapt, and so throw Sealand went And many a day, a silly weary man I traueilde there, and stoode with toile content Till God by Grace, a better Fortune sent And brought mee home, in safety, as you knoe Great thancks to him, I giue that sarude me soe. In Court where I, at rest and peace remainde A drift of the Duke of Alua to dispatch me. I thought apon, the part that Flemings plaide And for good will, since I was so retainde I thought to make, those roisters once afraide So hoiste vp saile, when I had anckar waide And into Fraunce, I slipte with much a do, Where lo a net, was making for mee to. Yet paste I throwe, to Paris without stoppe When ciuill broils, were likely to begin And standing there, within a marchaunts shoppe The Lord Embassador now Lord Norris did helpe mee avvay. I heard one saye, the Prince was comming in To Flaunders fast, with whom I laet had bin Before you wotte, thus hauing mirrie nues I stoole away, and so did Fraunce refues. But by your leaue, I fell in daungers deepe Before I could, in freedome go or ride Deuouring wolues, had like to slaine the sheepe And wiept their mouthes, apon the muttons hide Nought goes amisse, where God wilbe the gide So throw the place, where parrel most did seeme I past at will, when daunger was exstreeme. The Prince I found, from Collen at his house And there I saw, of Roitters right good store Who welcomde mee, with many a mad carouse Such is their gies, and hath bin euer more To Flaunders thus, we marcht and God before And neare the Rine, our Camp a season laye Till money came, and had a genrall paye. In Flaunders longe, our Campe remayned still And sweete with sowre, we tasted sondry wayes Who goes to warrs, must feele both good and ill Some likes it not, and some that life can prayes Where nights are cold, and many hongrie dayes Some will not be, yet such as loues the Drom Takes in good parte, the chaunces as they com. Perhaps my share, was not the sweetest thear I make no boest, nor finde no fault therein I sought my selfe, the burthen for to bear Amonge the rest, that had oer charged bin If smart I felt it was a plague for sin If ioy I founde, I knew it would not last If wealth I had, lo waest came on as fast. When Prince did passe, to Fraunce and Flaunders laft A Pesaunt betraide me and yet vvas God my deliuerer. I heence sought, to see my natiue soile He told me than, the French by some fine craft On me at length, would make a pray and spoile I toke my leaue, not fearing any foile But ere the day, the skie had cleane forsoek I fell in snare, as fishe on baited hoek. A wofull tale, it is to tell in deede Yet heare it out, and how God wrought for mee Note. The case was such, that I a gide did neede So in the field, full nere a willow tree I founde a carle, that needs my gide must bee His hand I had, his hart did halte the while And treason did, throwe trust the true begile. We held the waye, vnto S. Quintayns right As I did thincke, but long two leages I lost To case my horse, he bade me oft a light But I thereat, seemde dumme and deaffe as post Of stomacke stoute, the way oft times he crost And soughte to take, my bridle by the raine That sleight I found, and so he lost his paine. Had I turnde backe, the peysants wear at hand Who mounted were, on better horse than I A village neare, there was within that land Whear loe my gide, would haue me needs to lye Not so my frend, I aunswearde very hye Where at he knew the padde in straw was founde So toke the ball, and stroke it at rebounde. A great treacherie.Thou canst not scape, (? he) then light a downe Thou art but dead, thy life here shalt thou lose, And therewithall, the carle began to frowne And laide his hand, apon my Lether hose Throw sines he made, the towne by this aroes, And some by warres, that lately loste their good Sought to reueng, the same apon my blood. My gied leapt vp, apon the horse I roode And flang away, as fast as he could driue Downe was I haeld, and on my face they troode And for my roebs, the tormenters did striue My gide did crie, O leaue him not aliue An English churle, he is his tongue doth shoe And gold he hath, good store full well I knoe. They stript me streighte, from doblet to my short Yet hose they lafte, vntoutcht as God it would No powre they had, to do me further hort For as the knife, to throte they gan to hold To saue my life, an vpright tale I told They hearing that, laid all their weapons downe And askt me if, I knew saint Quintains towne. I past thereby whan to the Spawe I went (? I) and there, my pasport well was veaud If that be true, said one thou shalt be sent From hens in hast, and so they did conclued To towne I should, from sauage country rued So in the hey, they laid me all that night Yet sought my life, before the day was light. But as with weedes, some suffrante flower groes A secret prouision of God. So in that soile, a blessed man was bred Which vndertoke, to keepe me from my foes And saue my life, by fine deuice of hed He cald me vp, when they wear in their bed And bade me go, with him whear he thought best Lest in that place, full small should be my rest. I followde on, as he did lead the trace He brought me safe, where I in surety stood Thus God throw him, did shoe his might &amp; grace Which ioyde me more, than all this worldly good The other sort, wear butchers all for blood And daily slue, such stragglars as they toek For whom they laie, and watcht in many a noek. That hazard paste, I found more mischieues still The Captaine of Pyrroen h?dled me hardly. But none so great, nor none so much to fear With toile &amp; paine, with sleighte of head and skill From Fra?ce I came, and laft al mischief thear) Nowe here what fruite, my natiue soile doth bear See what I reap, and marke what I haue sowne And let my lucke, throwe all this land be knowne. First let me tell, how Fortune did me call To Garnesey thoe, to staye my troubled miend Vnder Captaine Leight? after all these toiles. Whear wel I was, althogh my wealth was smal And long had dwelt, if destnie had assiend But as the shippe, is subiect to the winde So we must chaenge, as checking chaunces falls Who tosseth men, about like tennis balls. This chaunce is she, some say that leads men out And brings them home, when least they looke therefore A dalling dame, that breeds both hope and dout And makes great wounds, yet seldom to salues the soer Not suer on sea, nor certaine on the shoer A worldly witch, that dealls with wanton charms For one good turne, she doth ten thousand harms. A figge for chaunce, this Fortune bears no shaep The people fonde, a name to Fortune giue Which sencelesse soules, do after shadoes gaep Great GOD doth rule, and sure as God doth liue He griends the corne, and sifts the meale throw siue And leaues the bran, as reffues of the flowre To worke his will, and shoe his mightie powre. Promoshon coms, ne from the East nor West Note. Ne South nor North, it faulls from heauen hie For God himselfe, sets vp who he thincks best And casts them downe, whose harts would clime the skie Thus earthly happs, in worldlings doth not lie We trudge we runne, we tied and breake out braine And backwarde come, the selfe same stepps againe. Till time aprotche, that God will man prefarre With labours long, in vaine we beat the ayre Our destnies dwell, in neither moone nor starre Nor comfort coms, from people foule nor fayre Small hoep in those, that sits in Golden chayre Their moods their minds, and all we go about Takes light from him, that putts our candel out. This argues now, all goodnes freely groes From him that first, made man of earthly mold Note. And floods of wealth, into their bosome floes That cleerly can, his blessed will behold As sheppards do, keepe safe their sheepe in fold And Gardnar knoes, how flowrs shold watred be So God giues ayde, ear man the want can se. Helps coms not sure, by hap or heads deuice Though wits of men, are means to worke y? waxe And cunning hands, do often cast the dice All these are toyes, trust vp in tinkars packs No flame wil ryes, till fier be thrust to flare No brantch may bud, till he that made the plant With dew of grace, in deede supplies the want. Can earth yeild fruit, til Springtime say do shoe? Can ayre be cleer, till foggs and miests are fled? Can seas and floeds, at eury season floe? Can men giue life, to shapes and bodies dead? Such secrets pas, the reatche of mans vaine head So loke to reap, no corne for all our toile Till Haruest come, and God hath blest the soile. The pottar knoes, what vessail serues his turne And therein still, he powreth liquor sweete The cooke well notes, what wood is best to burne And what conceites, is for the banket meete The Captaine marks, what souldiour hath most spreete And calls that man, to charge and office great Whan he thincks good, and saruice is in heat. Dare any wight, presume to take the place Of worthy charge, till he therto be cald? Dare subiect brag, before the Princes face? Or striue wyth staets, that are in honour stauld? Dare village boest, with Cittie stronglye wauld? Dare children clime, till they good footing find? No all thing yelds, to him that leads the minde. He lifts aloft, he flingeth downe as faste Note.He giues men fame, and plucks renowne awaye Hap doth not so, for chaunce is but a blaste An idle word, where with weake people playe Hap hangs and holds, on hazarde eury waye And hazard leanes, on doubt and danger deepe That glads but few, and maketh Milli?s weepe. I vse this terme, of hap in all I write As well to make, the matter large and long As any cause, or dram of great delite I take therein: But here I do yoe wrong To leade your eares, with such a senceles song From hearing that, I promesde haue to ende The bare discourse, the haplesse man hath pende. So comming home, and crept from toills abroed (With charged brest, and heuy heauing hart) I thought in Courte, my burthen to vnloed And cast away, the cares of former smart But there alas, my chaunce is so oerthwart I sit and sighe, and fold mine armes with all And in old griefes, a freshe begin to fall. Yea thear where most, my hope and haunt hath bin Where yeares and dayes, I spent apon the stocke And diuers doe, good hap and frendship win (And duetie makes, a world of people flocke) And thousands Loe, drawes water from the cocke I skarce may moist, my mouth when thirst is great And hart is cleane, consuemde with skalding heat. A spring of kinde, doth floe aboue the brim You cannot stoppe, a Fountaine if you would For throw harde rockes, it runneth cleare and trim And in some grounde, it casts vp graynes of gould It bursts the earth, and deepely diggs the mould It gusheth out, and goes in sondry vayns From mountaines topp, and spredeth all the plains. The Spring creeps vp, the highest hill that is And many wells, thear on are easlye found And this I wott, where you do water mis Small fruite doth groe, it is but barraine grounde The soile is sweete, where pleasaunt springs abounde The Cowslop sproutes, where springs and fountaines bee And floeds begin, from fountaine heads you see. The labring man, thearat doth coell his heat The byrds do haeth, their brests full brauely thear The brutest beasts, there in finds pleasure great And likes not halfe, so well another whear What cause in mee, what dout what fault or feare? That I maye not, in this so weak a plite Go drinck my fyll, whear eatch thing haeth delite. The moer we draw, the waetter from the well Note.The better farre, we bring the spring in fraem The seas themselues, of natuer ries and swell The moer the winde, &amp; weather works the saem The fier borns best, when bellows bloes the flaem Let things stande still, and stoer them not in time They shall decaye, by meane of drosse and slime. I see some streams, with sticks aer choked vp And riuers large, are marde with beds of sand I see some bring, from doells an empty cup Yet craues an almes, and shoes a needye hand I see baer boyes, befoer the banket stand And no man sayth, loe poer man if thou wutt Take heer a dishe, to fill thy hongry gutt. Of cormrant kinde, some crammed capons are The moer they eat, the moer they may consuem Some men likewise, the better that they faer The worse they be, and sicker of the ruem And some so chaef, so frowne so fret and fuem When others feede, they cannot God he knoes Spaer any time, the dropping of thear noes. The bords aer spred, and feasts aer made thereon And sutch sit downe, that haeth their bellies full Whose greedy mouthes, from dogg would snatch y? boen Which snodges swell, and loke like greisie wull They puffe they bloe, yea like a baited bull And shoue them backe, that on small croems would feede Whose pashent harts, maks vertue of a neede. The glotton thincks, his belly is to small When in his eye, a deintie morssell is He grins and gaeps, as though no crom shold fall From him: and loeks as al the world wear his Thus sutch as want, aer suer the poest to kis For powltting pried, doth preace so fast in place That poer plain Tom, daer skarce come sho his face. Eatch one doth seeke, for to aspier and ries Yet haet we those, that doth by vertue clime The foole hee skorns, the worship of the wies Yet dolts presuem, beyond the wyes sometime And all this strief, is but for dros and slime That out of earth, wee digg with daungers deepe Full hard to winne, and much more wors to keepe. This makes me mues, when some haue heaps in hord They will not help, the neerest freinde they haue And yet with smiels, and many a frendly word They graunt to giue, before a man doth craue Sutch barbors fine, can finely poul and shaue And washe full cleane, till all away they washe Than good sir Griem, like lobb they leaue in lashe. What should men loes, when they enoughe haue had If they did part, with things that might be sparde? A litle peece, out of a golden gad For seruice long, might be a great rewarde No no as steele, and flinte is stiffe and harde So world is waxt, and no good turne is founde But whear in deede, do doble giftes rebounde. Wee make a legge, and kisse the hand with all (A French deuice, nay sure a Spanish tricke) And speake in Print, and say loe at your call I will remaine, your owne both dead and quicke A Courtiar soe, can giue a lobbe a licke And dresse a dolt, in Motley for a while And so in sleeue, at sillye wodcocke smile. If meaning went, with painted words and shoes It mighte suffice, such cortteis cheer to taest But with the same, disdaine and enuye goes And trompry great, with words and winde in waest Than arme in arme, coms flattry full of haest And leads a way, the sences out of frame That vpright witts, are thereby stricken lame. This lowtting lowe, and bowing downe the knee But groeps mens minds, to creepe in credits lapp Like malte horse than, he holds vp head you see That late before, could vaile both knee and capp The Nurse a while, can feede the child with papp And after beate, him on the breetch full baer A swarme God wot, of these fine natuers aer, There be that biets, yet gronts and whines withall There be that winnes, yet sweare and say they loes There be that stops, and stealls away the ball There be that plantes, a weede &amp; plucks a roes There be pleads wante, to whom the fountaine floes Such hieds there haps, to make the world to thincke At fayre well head, they neede not for to drincke. The Whales you see, eates vp the little fishe The prettie Penk, with Sammon may not swim The greatest heads, are fedde with finest dishe To foulest pits, fayre water runneth trim Hee gets the gaine, that standeth nere the brim He bloes the cole, that hath cold fingers still He starues for bread, that hath no corne at mill. A world to see, the course and state of things Some would get vp, y? knoes not where to light Some soer the skies, that neuer had no wings Some wrastle well, by cunning not by might Some seems to iudge, fayre coulours w?out sight And eury one, with some odde shift or grace In world at will, runs out a goodly race. But to be plaine, I lagg and come behinde As I wear lame, and had a broken legg Or els I cannot, lye within the winde And harken still, what I might easlie begg I neede not say, in mouth I haue a gegg For I haue spoke, and sped in matters small By helpe of him, that hath my Uerses all. But farre God wot, I am from that I seeke And misse the marke, that many men do hit Wherfore salt tears, do trickle downe the cheeke And hart doth feele, full many a wofull fit And so aside, in sollem sorrow sit As one in deede, that is forsaken cleane Wher most he doth, deserue and best doth meane. No matter now, though ech man march &amp; tread On him that hates, the life he beares about Yet such as shall, these heauy Uerses read Shall finde I blame, my fortune out of dout But sens on hope, no better hap will sprout I yeild to death, and vpward lift the minde Where lothsome life, shall present comfort finde. Sens hope can haue, no hony from the Hiue And paines can plucke, no pleasure for his toile It is but vaine, for weery life to striue And streatch out time, with torment and tormoile Get what we can, death triumphes oer the spoile Than note this well, though we win neer so mitch When death taeks al, we leaue a mizer ritch. To liue and lacke, is doble death in deede A presente death, exceeds a lingring woe Sens no good hap, in youth did helpe my neede In age why should, I striue for Fortune soe Old years are come, and haests me hens to goe The time draws on, I hate the life I haue When hart shall breake, my griefe shall ende in graue. Should I seeke life, that finds no place of rest Ne soile nor seate, to shroude me from the ayre When cramping colde, beclipps my carefull brest And dollor driues, my hart in deepe dispayre For such foule dayes, darke death is wondrous fayre As good to make, the skrawlling worms a feast As pleas y? world, wher mischiefe maks her neast. Hie time it is, to haest my carkas hens Youth stoole awaye, and felt no kinde of ioye And age he laft, in trauell euer sens The wanton dayes, that made me nice and coye Wear but a dreame, a shadoe and a toye Sith slaurye heer, I finde and nothing els My hoem is thear, wher soule in freedome dwels. In warrs and woe, my yeers aer waested clean What should I see, if lordly lief I led I loek in glas, and finde my cheeks so lean That eury owre, I do but wishe mee ded Now back bends downe, &amp; forwards faulls y? hed And hollow eyes, in wrinckled brow doth shrowd As though two stars, wear creping vnder clowd. The lipps waxe cold, and loeks both pael &amp; thin The teeth fawlls out, as nutts forsoek the shaell The baer bald head, but shoes whear hear hath bin The liuely ioynts, waxe weery stiffe and staell The reddy tongue, now folters in his taell The wearishe face, and tawny collour shoes The corraeg quaills, as strength decayes and goes. The sweete delites, are dround in dulled minde The gladsome sports, to groning sighes are bent The frisking lims, so farre from frame I finde That I forthincke, the time that youth hath spent But when I way, that all these things wear lent And I must pay, the earth her dutie throw I shrincke no whit, to yeld these pleasures now. Had I possest, the giftes of Fortune heer A house a wyfe, and children therewithall And had in store (to make my frendes good cheer) Sutch comm? things, as neighbours haue at call In such dispayre, perchaunce I would not fall But want of this, and other lackes a skore. Bids me seeke death, and wishe to liue no more. Yet for to beare, a peece of all my woes (And to impart, the priuie pangs I felt) From countrie soile, a sober wife I choes In mine owne house, with whom I seldom dwelt When thousandes slepte, I waekt I swet I swelt To compas that, I neuer could attaine And still from hoem, abroed I braek my braine. The thatcher hath, a cottage poore you see The sheppard knoes, where he shal sleepe at night The daily drudge, from cares can quiet bee Thus Fortune sends, some rest to eurye wight So borne I was, to house and lande by right But in a bagg, to Court I brought the same From Shrews brye towne, a seate of auncient fame. What thinkes my frindes, that thear behind I laft What fault finds she, that gaue me lief and suck O courting fien, thou art to cold a craft The Carter haeth, at hoem much better luck Well, well I saye, a due all worldly muck Ne howse nor land, we bear away I knoe I naked cam, and naked hence must goe. The greatest kyng, must pas the self saem way Our daye of byrth, and buriall are alike Their ioye, their pompe, their wealth and rich araye Shall soen consuem, like snow that lies in dieck No bucklar serues, when sodayn death doth striek As soen may coem, a poer mans soule to blys As may the rich, or greatest Lord that is. Well ear my breath, my body doe forsaek My spreet I doe, bequeath to God aboue My bookes, my skrowls, and songs that I did maek I leaue with frindes, that freely did me loue To flyring foes, whoes mallice did me moue I wyshe in haest, amendment of their wayes And to the Court, and courtiars happy dayes. My fortuen straunge, to straungers doe I leaue That strangly can, retain such straung mishap To such as still, in world did me disseaue I wyshe they may, bewaer of such lyk trap To sclaundrous tongues, that kyld me with their clap I wyshe moer rest, than they haue gyuen me And bles thoes shreaws, that corst and crabbed be. To such as yet, did neuer pleasuer man I giue those ryems, that nyps the gawlled back To such as would, do good and if they can I wyshe good luck, long lief, and voyd of lack To currysh karls, a whyp and collyars sack And to the proud, that stands vpon their braus A waynskot face, and twenty crabtree staues. To surly syers, that scorns the meaner sort A nightcap foord, with Foyns I them bequeath To such as skowll, at others good report (And sets much stoer, by their owne paynted sheath) In sien of luck, I giue a willowe wreath To such as aer, vnnaemd and merits mutch The stoen I leaue, that tries the gold by tutch. To gentill race, with good conditions ioynd I wyshe moer ioy, than man imagin maye And sens for pooer, I haue no money coynd God graunt them all, a mery mariage daye To such as doth, delyte in honest playe I wyshe the gold, that I haue lost thearby And all the wealth, I want befoer I dye. Now frends shaek hands, I must be gon my boyes Our myrth taeks end, our triumph all is don Our tykling talk, our sports and myrry toyes Do flyed away, lyke shadow of the Son Another coms, when I my race haue ron Shall passe the tyme, with you in better plyt And finde good cause, of greater things to wryt. FINIS. A DISCOVRSE HOVV vertue seames to sleape and Iustice is euer awaken. When vertue layd her down to slepe, and would no longer wake: And wicked world did wanton waxe, as vice would triumphe make. I sat and mused all the while, on thinges of wonders weight: As though our latter iudgement daye at hand were comming streight. For loe eache land and kingdom large, In compas of my vewe: Stode all bespred with wailing wightes, and sodaine sorowes newe. Some ran to rayse dame vertue vp, but none durst stirre her thoe: Disordred lief kept people back, and said let vertue goe. Dead sleape hath caught her for a space, to plague proud haguhtie heads: That wallowes in their wayward willes, on pleasures wanton beddes. The feble folke that liues in feare, and feade in cottage colde: Were halfe amasd to here the tale, that lawles life had tolde. Is vertue slombring nowe alas, ? one that felt much wrong: Than shall the poore with pensyue mynde, complayn of grief to long. This was no sooner said but loe, in fieldes and forestes thick: I harde a heape of wounded hartes, that pincht were nere the quicke. Crye out so loude they perst the cloudes, and in their roaring tewne: They did pronounce that wretched folke, full sone should come to rewne. If sacred Gods that guydes the Starres, and rules both Sun and Moone: Brought not a boxe of precious balme, to salue the mischief soone. In this discourse and dolefull brutes, came reuell roughly clad: And made wilde hauocke sound the dr?me, as all the world were mad. And so was haerbraine broyles abroche, and men embrued in blode: Began to striue with stoute attempts, For rule and worldly good. The horse did see where lay his strength, and would not rayned bee: The Oxe forsooke the wonted plowe, the Asse would neades go free. And flang the burthen on the floore, thus sauage grewe they all: That had ben tame and meke as lambe, and long at maisters call. The common sorte beholding this, laft labour care and toyle: And sought throw sleights &amp; snatching shifts to thriue and liue by spoyle. Nowe dullardes were so quicke of sence, they gan dispute the case: And sifted finely flowre from Braune, and had so trym a grace. They could beguyle the Mylnar smoth, and make the Baker smyle: It was a world to see the worlde, And worldlings all the whyle. When folly wrought by slipper meanes, to reache beyonde the wyse: As though blynde Bayards boulnes rude, could blere cleer Argos eyes. Yet diuelyshe braynes and depe deceite, did driue such combrous drieftes: That plainenes in a pilgrims wede, was put vnto her shieftes. True dealing was but cauld a doult, or els Gods foole in deade: Dame flattery claymed frindships place, yet faild her frinde at neade. And robbry was good purchace helde, and lust was sollace sweete: And they were calld the liuely laddes, that had the quickest sprete. Som said lords hestes were held for lawes, but those were Chavvsers woordes: And faith did faile in old priestes sawes, tushe all this was but boordes. Yet in flat earnest this was trewe, the gredy groppt for gaine: And hungry guts might gnaw their g?mes and still in grief complayne. And priuate profitte prowlde for pence, her purse laye open wyde: Thus publike state with rufull noyse, vnto the heauens cryed. For helpe and succour to the harmes, that fell on cursed earth: That neuer yet was pure and free, from plagues since Abels birth. O wytles wightes the Goddes said thoe, that sittes aboue the skies: O people vayne why do you pewle, and make such wretched cries. Thinke you we haue forgotten cleane, the feble force of man: Sawe we not what should come to passe, ere first the world began. Yees suer, and ordeind goodly lawes, to stay your strougling states: And alwayes helde vp Iustice still, to ende your sharpe debates. Are you so childishe to beleaue, though vertue seame to dreame: That we will suffre staetly vice, to striue against the streame. No, no, our lawes shall linke you faste, in leages of loue full long: And learne eche man to know his owne, and what is right and wrong. The pyllars that holdes vp the house, and props vnto the same: Are knowen among good workemen all, of such as buildings frame. What comforts kinges &amp; comon weales, and keepes the lande in awe: But noble rule and threatning sworde, and worthy vpright lawe. Though vertue doe not shine so bright, as she was wonte of olde: In iustice seate if you liste searche, her beames you may beholde. At times and termes as temperance tunes, the stringes that are amisse: So lawe reformes the wilfull worlde, when out of square it is. And Iustice suer shall neuer die, whyle Solons name is knowen: And whiles that wytte and reason learnes, eache man to know his owen. These wordes thus spoke of fearful Gods, the world shranke back for feare: And I beleud myne adell bed, these thinges had dreamed theare. FINIS. CHVRCHYARDES dream written to Master VVilliam Harbert Esquier, dwellinge at Sainct Gillians by Carlion in Walles. Som men affyrm Dreams are vntrue, But what the iudgment is of you I know not yet, but well I thinke They may proceed, of meat or drinke Receyud before the sleep we take Complexcions often fancies make And talke of thyngs oer night befoer Breedes dreams in som mens heds great stoer. But this you know, the powrs aboue Our earthly vessels heer doth moue By cowrs as they, are of thear kinde And sets the moshons in our minde As oen might say we nothyng do But Planets pricks vs thearvnto. Loek how the Heauens order is The Earth must follow, grant me this, Than we that of the Earth are maed Must needs obay, the Heauens traed Fowre Ellements of eatch ye kno Or all we feell, the ruell is so: Som won moer mixt thearwith we se And subiect moer, than others be To them among vs heer remayn But what of that, to break my brayn About disputing of sutch thing Or yet my wits in erors bring I need not seartch so deep a cace I shuld but ron beyond my race. Yet of som dreams that aer deuien Let me a lytell heer defien Noet.For priuey warnings god doth giue By sleeps to thoes that heer do liue. Was not the dreams of kings sought owt By danniell who, maed cleer eatch dowt That by the saem might ries or spring Takes god no caer but for aking Is not the poer to him as deer The meanest as the greatest peer Thoght on of him, yeas than be suer By dreams somtims he doth procuer A man to think on, things to com A dream may speak that seemeth dom. A dream haeth lief though sleeps full ded Breed fancies in, an Idell hed Som when they wack do soen forget What sweauons in the night they met And driues the day to end with all And at the length vnwaeres doth fall In that great floed or in that stream That they aer warnd of by thear dream. But I that for to shon is glad The danger of a dream I had Do tell the saem, loe this hit was The dream begynsMe thought from hoem as I did pas Unto your howse you said that tied You had a iorney for to ried A hors you lent me for the saem So forth we roed and had good gaem We lawght and checkled all the waye But as you kno that after playe Coms caer and sorow so it fell When I beleud that all was well You frownd and flang from me for of And as I vsed was to skoef I gestid still and followed fast But you oer roed me at the last And for I would not tier my nag I shaept my self behind to lag A loen I prickt and palfray spord And mutch I thought yet spaek no word Saue that I said with voyce full loe Whate wil my frind forsaek me soe? What new told taell doth torn him thus No taell a toy hit is ywus No toy he is to wies therfore Som thing hit is yea les or more But what hit is I need not fear For seartch my consience eury whear And cleer it standeth in eatch traed To him since he my freende I maed. Thus muesing on mi giltles cace I then began, to meand my pace And as the deuell wold hit soe That I, ill hap shuld not forgo. (When mischeeus com they fawl on heap) My hors did start and gan to leap The iaed I think had seen a spriet He maed the fier ries from his feet Out of the stoens whear he did tramp Lord than howe I did staer and stamp And thrust the sporrs in to his sied But girth and saddell baed abied They fell from Hors full all to broek And in the myer, flat like an oek I lay a long, but what of that Ear I roes vp, and found my hat Which laye fast by, an Elders roet My Hors was gon, and I on foet. My face with dirt, was so araid Hit maed the hors, thear of afraid For as I ran the Iaed to get The poer plain people that I met Thoght suer I had bin clean best raught, Oen gaue me way, a nother laught The third said sir go washe your face But still I had my beast in chace And ran not swearing half a myel But toek the Iaed agaynst a stiel By that was Curttals bryedell lost And I might ryed (but not in post) On gawldid back and carrayn boens The harneys, saddell all at oens Was broek as sayd afoer I haue Noet.Than could I call no oestlar knaue Nor face him down my gear was gon And piekt away by hangers on That follow geasts to eury In By shift som payre of Boets to win Sutch filtchars haue so great a lack They steall the Saddell from the back But I that brought a Saddell out Might ried now like a gentil lout Thear was no theef to shrowd my shaem But plaen poer Tom, to bear the blaem What needs moer words, of this to speake Get vp I did on Hors full weake. My girdell was the bridell than Thus rode I like a clean yong man. A greater fier was in the straw, As in the Dream me thought I saw, A further mischeef after this. I founde and felt loe this it is. As I my iorney thought to take The Horssis backe a two it brake Note. Out stept his bones, in fell my cors Amid the belly of the Hors I looked still, whan he would fall He seemd to haue no harm at all: And kept the way and boer it out, With that I would haue tornd about To see if all belongd him to Would sarue as they wear wont to do. His lims I mean, which wear so soer That he had mind to turn no moer But hoemward, held as fast a mayn, As any Ienet could of Spayn. Or Irysh hobby fayre and fat I would not haue beleeued that. If one had tolde it for no lie But sure I saw it with mine eye As well as in a dream I might I lay no hed, on things by night As in the day I had them seen This was of troeth and this I ween Hath diffrence far for troeth is sound And weenyng dwels on doubtfull ground But sens I com vnto this clause Now will I talke and sho som cause Of Dreams and let the matter rest Of my deformed broke backt beast. Yet shall my pen heer after playn Unto my porpes turn agayn.

A father that was much to prayes In bringing vp his babes eatch on He myght be calde a parragon In teaching youth and vsing age Would god catch man would wear his bage And seek his lyurey for to haue Than in thear harts they should engraue The feare of God, his armor coet And all the worship that he goet, His aerms, his collors and his crest His hoep, his curatts for his brest His sheld, his sword, his enmies rod And to be short, the fear of God Was all or moest, of his delite In fleashly tabuls God did write. His law, his fear and blessed will Far past the compasse of our skill I mean within the humble mind (Of this goodman well bent of kind) With parfit stamp was printed fast The law and fear I spake of last As all his childern taught he well To oen apart this did he tell (Moer oftnar than vnto the rest Noet.Perhaps that boy, he loued best) How if he would his blessyng win Than with this ruell he must begin First eury mornyng whan he roes Before he had put on his cloes He should a sollem praier say To God to keep him all the day That he did purpose well to spend And whan the day, was brought to end (And should repayre vnto his bed) Another praier should be sed Before he slept, if this he did In eury point, as he was bid The Father sayd, that God on hie Would blesse the place, whear he did lie And giue an Angell, charge he sed To keep good watch, about the bed. That neither feend, nor fearfull sight Should vexe the silly soul that night, His son that lesson kept full well And neuer from that order fell But most deuoutly that he vsd Till wanton life, had him abuesd And made him minde, sutch follies heer As retchlesse youth, doth bye full deer. Whose pleasuers whan the son had caught The goodly ruell, his father taught In very deed, forgotten was And littell did, this yong man pas How he the day, or night had spent But heer what plaegs was aftter sent. Noet. What restles sleeps and dreams he had For som tims as he had bin mad (When in the bed he down was laid) He did sutch things as wold haue Fraid The stowttest man, that treds in shue And farther moer, I may tell youe He was aferd him self ful oft For nothing stoerd by him so soft Wythin the chaember that he sleept) But thearwith vnder cloes be crept And durst not speak, of any thing To be of all the world a king. Theas fancies did not chang him so But he had torments many moe Of other secret fears with in When for to sleep, he did begin. Which alttred him on sutch a sort I can not make thearof report. Sutch frights and startyng in the bed And of his mowth, I haue hard sed He thoght he sawe, and markt hit wel A thowsand deuells owt of hel Com ronning on him all at oens Som toer his fleash som broek his boens Som flang him down, as than he thoght And was thearwith in slomber broght But stil his fancies did him fraem To crie alowd, on Ihesus naem Yea sutch as slept with him haue hard That he the blessed naem prefard Of Ihesus suerly first of all Noet.And whan thear on this man did call His raeg of storms began to slaek And streight from sleep he did awaek Than would he loek vnto the lord And so the fathers ruell record No soener was a prayer said But sownd as baeb in cradell laid He slept, and hath don oftten sence This prous that vnder gods defence Man waeks &amp; sleeps, and dreams som whiels And as he at our folly smiels A gentill warning doth he giue Because he would haue sinnars liue And so conuert, for causis knoen To him that sitts in sacred throen He gieds and gouerns eury whear And brings the hawty harts in fear To mak men knoe from whence we haue The quiet sleeps, and rest we craue. I could of dreams mutch moer resit But this suffiseth that I writ To shoe that dreams of many men Aer true, or moshons now and then To mak vs way, in ballance right That god with wonders works his might And doth in sleep, a messaeg send (Unto som purpose and som end) To man whoes thoughts and doings boeth He seeth and marks what path he goeth Nowe to retorn (I think hit best) Whear I did leaue, and sho the rest How that my hors that iomlyng iaed To be at home sutch labour maed Yet must I needs, now wonder how This moustrous thyng could bear me throw But things in Dreams ye kno may seem That out of Dreams, no man will deem As did this to, for who would think (Or in his hed could let it sinke) That in the bowels of a beast Thus I could ried, or at the least How Hors away so fast did trot The dream would haue it so ye wot. Now when to stable door we cam The royll stoed still as any Lam Then did I light and went my wey Thear at the hors began to ney He maed so lowd and shrill a sownd As though in sunder shaekt the grownd: I neuer saw, in sutch a heat (Whan on the earth his feet he beat.) Ne beast nor man, nor lyuyng thyng And as the bruit therof did ryng Within your earrs you cam to se What ruell and reuell this might be. Wherwith the Hors agaynst his kind In reason did declaer his mind And spake in order like a man But when to talk the Horse began You muesd and all your howse eatch oen That still stood wondryng thear apon: But loe he told his taell so well And so rehersid euery dell How I within his belly roed That you than without moer aboed In his behalf sayd vnto me Is this an honest pranke of the First to offende me as thou knoest Than further in thy folly goest And breaks the back of my poer hors And after ridest in his cors And not content with that fowl part But here agayn, returned art To set my hart, on anger moer Perchance thou maist repent it soer.

In Waels thear is a borrow town, Carmarden hight the same: Whear dwelt somtimes a lusty Freer, I neede not sho his name. This Freer was fat and full of fleash, a iolly myrry knaue: Who with the gossips of the town, him self could well behaue. Thoes welthy wiues and thrifty daems, could neuer mak good cheer: Nor well dispuet of Peeters keis, if absent wear this Freer. He said his mattens in thear eares, and gospell at thear bed. And spaerd no sarues for the quick, nor caerred for the dead. With abbotts cas and faering wel, this Freer to wantton was: That neither maid nor married wief, his Dorttour doer might pas. With out som stop sutch staells he laid, to make them stomble in: That by his lyef men gest he thought, that letchry was no syn. A louing Freer good fellow like, in thoes daies was he held: In eury corner of the town, good compneie owt he smeld. And as ye kno in hauntyng longe, all sortes of people thear: He must finde out som baytyng place, a Mistres fowl or fear. A deyntie morsell for his toeth, these Freers loud well to faer: Though som were pleasd with cheesis stil, som fownd a better shaer. As did this honest brother in christ, by gosseping about: Who whan he wold a hakney ried, had fownd a palfray out. A nag mutch of a womans height, that vsed for to bear: Moer sacks perchance vnto the Myl, than corn was griended thear. I not declaer what trim consaits, he gaue her all the whiell: Ear he obtaind the thing he sought, howe he his tong could fiell. To talk and mince the matter well, the better to disgeast: And how full oft at morrow Masse, his Mystres could he feast. And after noen to gardens walk, and gatherd Poesies gaie And woer them cloesly in his cowll, as he did saruis saie. Nor can not shoe you half the seats, he wroght to please his trull: But those moest fit for you to read, heer put in riem I wull Note.A Shuemakar that held a shop, Farre from his dwelling place: A faire wife had a good brown weantch, and com of no il race. Som sai of waggtaills pretti foells, a kindred great and good: That knoes what shears wil sarue the torn, when shroes will shaep a whood. The cheef of this great lynnage leads, thear liues like holly Nons: That for releef in gadding time, a bowt the cloister rons. A catter wawlling oens a week, in breath to keep them well: Least virgins shuld som surffet taek, when they lead aeps in hell. This woman went not out of kind, and suer for Simons sake She vsd great deeds of charitie, and mutch a do did make. Saint Simon was a goodly man, the Freer might so be cald I towtch no further least he kick, for suer his backe is gald. Aliue the man was many yeers sens abbaies wear suprest: And dwelt not farre from cardief town, when written was this Iest. But to my taell let me retorn, this woman seldom faild The morowe masse at fowre aclok, to see how Christ was naild. Unto the cross to whom she kneeld, with back and beads in fist: And for deuoshion many times, this gentill freer she kist. At eury Pater noster whiell, which was a preshoes thyng. And Iesus how hit did her good, to heer her lubbor sing. And whan he tornd about his face, and loeked throwe the queer: She skrat her hed, she sat on pricks, and crept the awter neer. This costom kept she many daies, the freer thear of full glad: Yet still refard his other sport, till better tune wear had. You must conceyue this mirry man, in Ieasts and lyght consaits: His hed was set and for the saem full oft he laid his baits. To lawghe and pas the time away, such toyes he would deuise: That few men for the mirth therof, Note.the matter could dispise. Upon a day apoynted was, this wife as was her vse: Should early come to morrow Masse, there might be made no skuese. She kept her owre and hard she kneeld, without the Dorttour doer: The Freer cam forth and haeld her in, and flang her on the floer. Fie, fie, sir Freer she cried a pace, but what should more be sed? She was content to take her ease, and leap into the bed. And as myne aucthor doth declare, the sownder for to sleepe: She had no more apon her thoe, than hath a shoeren sheep. Syr Sunkin had no poynts to lowse, in Cowll and all he skips: God send my Freer well forth agayne, the Moen was in the clips. How long he lay, or what he did, in soeth I cannot tell: But at the leyngth the Sexten went, and range the Serues bell. The Freer wisht Rope about his neck, the Mattens was begun. That he that moern would sing or say, and all the Lessons dun. Yet vp he must for fear of check, his course was com to ries: The night before he tooke his rest, to heale his bleared eyes. A law there was within that howse, who slept the saruis out: In Fracttry should be hoyst full hie, and whipt like breetchlesse lout. Whearfore to tinder boxe he stept, and light a Sies in haest: And as he gyrded knotted kord full hard about his waest, Lye still sayd he vnto his geast, I must go take some payn: And singe a Psalme within the queer, but I will come agayne. Out goes he then, that likte her not, she durst not lie aloen: For feare of buggs, thus leaue I now, a bed this goodwise Ioen. And tell you howe in queer full lowd this shauen kock he kroes And drownd his fellows eury choen, he sange so in the noes. But as he tornd the plain song book, full smoethly cowld he smiell Yet noen of all the couent could, perceyue him all the whiell. To mend his mirth &amp; make him lawghe, a fancie fell in thought He sawe the owner of the beast, that he had ryd for nought. The housband of the wife in deed, that he in bed had laft Who walkt with in the churche beneath, all carelesse of this craft. Note.Be god thought he I wyll goe proue, this man if he do knoe His wife by measuring her foet, or mark a pen her toe. For if I so disceaue the foell, and make the wyfe a serd He nor his wyef is near the wors, a hear not of his berd. And I shall mutch the better be, and laughing haue at will Thus eury way and be my luck, I shall haue sport my fill. Down went this good religeous man, whear hornsby housband walkt And cortchy made and dowkt full lee. and as he with him talkt. I a haue (? he) known thee right longe, and still the troeth to say I haue thee fownde a faithfull frend, in euery kynde of way A customar thou hast of me, my Money I bestowe On thee before all other men that dwels within thy rowe. And to be playn I loue thee well and playner now I am Than giue good eare I shall declaer, whearfore to thee I cam. But wise and waerly vse my words, and keep my councell boeth Thy promis is sufficient band, I will no further geth. This man full well he knue his good, who cortched to the grownd Sweet syr (? he) tell on your mind, I am your beadman bownd. Thou knoest my neybor men must liue and haue a wentch somtime, And we poer Freers must keep it cloes, for fear of open crime It wear a spot vnto our house, a sklandor to our name When we haue sport if all the world, shuld vnderstand the same. For god himself doth giue vs leaue, as thou hast hard ear nowe Althoughe the world we do disseaue in keping of our vowe. I am to long in preaching thus, and time I do abues, I haue a wentch for whom thou must, go make a pair of shues. Let them be good, when I thee pay, a penny more to boet I shal the giue, I lake (?) he, the measuer of her foet Than boldly spake this baer foet Freer, by God that shalt thou haue: If thou keep close and follow me, els call the Freer a knaue. The streight playn path to Dortter than. they tooke the way full right: The Freer before, but you must note, it was not full day light. Wherfore the man cam farre behind, the Freer went in a pace And causd his wentch the others wife, right cloes to hide her face. When entred was this honest man, put forth thy foet (? he) The Freer I mean which at that time, the bolder man might be. She thrust her leg out of the bed, but hed fast vnder cloes She kept and curst the sausie Freer, a hundreth times god knoes. The workeman tooke his measure well, and had no further caer The Freer well laught within his sleeue, thus pleased both they aer. But how the wife contentid was, let wyues be iudge here in: That from their housbands beds somti in sutch like cace hath bin. Yet let me shoe how she did quake, and tremble all the whiell And wisht the roeprip hangd full hie, that did her thus begiell And how for feare her body was, on water eury part Here after shall you kno likewise, what hate was in her hart Which for the time she couerd wel, and near a word she spake Her husband haested to his shop, and so his leaue did take I haue a payre of shues (? he) which I shall bryng a non) All reddy made for my wiues foet, and hers I think both oen Ye say the troeth good moem thought she, the Freer hath playd the knaue Make for your wife what shues ye list, the measure twise you haue. The Freer rons forth, y? man went hoem the woman lay a space As she had bin in swadlyng clowts, and durst not sho her face. When she had found her self aloen, she roes and speed did make To be at home ear her goodman, his breakefast cam to take. As in her house she did ariue, she bard the doer full fast And burst a weepyng like a babe, and this she sayd at last. O he shameles knaue, not pleasd to spoill me of my wiuely fame But at my fautes thy frantik hed, must make therof a game Could not my breatch of wedlockes band, content thee but to spyt Thou must deuise so leawd a fact, my fayth wyth frawd to quyt, Howe dydst thou knoe, I durst not [illeg.], that towtched was so neer I might haue skapt my housbands wrath, but thou hadst bought it deer. If I had spoek as oens I thoght, to do my fear was sutch Thy folly had bin tentimes moer, though mien were very mutch. He might haue toke his wife again, and knockt full well thy paet And shaud thy crowne a nother sort, than fawls for thien estaet. Or els he might haue shaemd vs boeth, and so refuesd his wief I could haue liud, but whear woldst thou, haue led a Frears lief? O beastly wretch that of thy self, hast had so small regard As for the knauery shewd to me, I will it well reward. Not for the mallice due therfore, but that I minde to leaue Example to thy fellows all, how they their frinds disceaue. Did I procuer thee to this deed, did not thy Gospels sweet And momblyng oft make me beleue, a Deuill was no spreet? Didst not thou seeke me euery owre. to sho me thy good will, And brought me grapes and goodly fruets, among my gossips stil. Thou caerst not if ten couple of hounds, did follow me full fast: And I a Fox wear in the field, sins now thy geer is past. Did not thy flyryng face ful oft, frame me thus to thy fist: Than wast thou hot, now art thou cold, or warms the whear thou list. A warmyng place within the towne, here after mayst thou lacke: And mis perchance so meet a seat, to drinke a cup of Sacke. Thou keepst not sutch a diet still, nor art not so presies: But as the thirst doth com agayn, thy appetite will ries. I pray to God it be my lot, to see thee at that stay: So thus the woman held her peace, and out she went her way. Unto the market for to seeke, sutch thinges as hozwiues doe You know that haue more skil than I, what doth belong theartoe. The poer man brought the Freer his shues and thought no harm thearin: And to his labour did return, his liuing for to win. His wief and he as they wear wont, full quiet dayes did lead, He near perceyued by her shue, whear she awry did tread. She went as vpright in the street, and with as good a grace: And set apon her follies past, in deed as bold a face, As she that neuer maed offence, for custom breeds a law: And maks them keep their countnance trim, that ones haue broek a straw. Well, all the winter passed forth, this couple at theyr will: The wief her counsell kept full cloes, the poer man ment noen ill. But as the spryng cam on a pace, the Freer waxt wanton toe: And fayn would nag, but credit lost, he knue not whear to wooe. And so bethought him of the prank, he playd in way of sport: And sought to salue the soer agayn, with words and medsons short. So he deuiesd amends to make, and turn hit to a gest: And thought to laugh the matter out, as it was meet and best. Note.And as by chance he met this wief, god speed sweet hart (? he) I maruell why these many dayes, you are so strange to me. The Fowlers myrry whistell now, must needs betrap the byrd: The wielly wief now shaept her tong, to giue the Freer agird: Not strang (? she) but that in faith, I did vnkindly take: The part ye playd, and yet I thought, it was for fauours saek Or for som mirth, for if of spight, it had byn wrought I kno: I should haue had som shaem ear this, but suer I finde not so. I swear by good saynt Francis daem, the troeth thou sayst in deed: Whearfoer let pas sutch follies old, that may nue quarrels breed. And be my freend thou hast good wit, thou knoest now what I mean: Let all old iests long gon and past, be now forgotten clean. The wief thus findyng fortuen good, to compas that she would: A gentill liemtwig gan she mak, to take the Freer in hold. Yet shaept to saue them harmles boeth, from blot and worldly shaem: And quit the knack, so she might laughe, and haue thear at som gaem. Well sir (quoth she) I kno at full, the meanyng of your mind: And would to God som honest way, for you now I might find. My husband haply may me mis, if I should com to you: Than our old fatches will not sarue, we must deuies a nue. A collour must the paynter cast, on poests and patched wawls: Who tacks away a stomblyng stock, shall freely skaep from fawls. A Iellows toye is taken soen, a trifull breeds mistrust: Great danger folows fowll delits as sklander folows lust. If will be won with worldly shaem the pleasuers torns to payn: Whearfor we need a doble clock, to keep vs from the rayn. When that my husband is in shop, if you the pains will taek: To com vnto my howse betimes, thear will myrry maek. But com as soen and if youe may, as any daie apeers: The way ye knoe vnto my howse, hit standeth by the freers. I wyll sayd he, and sight thear with, so wrong her by the hand: But littell of the matter yet, the foel did vnderstand. As beettell brains are broght in breers, before they se the snaer: So this wise wodkok in a net, was caught ear he was waer. The time cam on, the Freer was there, and vp the stayers he went: A cup of Malmsie (? the wife,) now would vs boeth content. The littell boy that is beneath, shal soen go fetch the same: Take money with thee ? the Freer, so thus goes down the dame. Unto the boy and bad him run, vnto the shop aboue: And bid his maister com in haest, if he his wyef did loue. For sick she was, but boy ? she, than trodg thowe for the drink: O boy I fear that I shall sownd, befoer thow com I thinck. Out flings the lad, vp goes the w and at a windowe pride: Untill at length farre of ful wel, her husband had she spyde. Alas go hied the quickly freer, sayd she if that thow can: For heer at land I do not fain, thear commeth my good man. Heer is no corner to get owt, ful woe is me ther foer: Nowe that we by our pastime deer, and pay for pleasuers soer. Now all the myscheef wilbe mien, because I haue the heer: Nowe shall my honest naem be broght, in question by a Freer. Wel nowe thear is no nother shift, but heer the bront to bied: Except that in this littel cheast, thyself nowe canst thowe hied. Nowe chues thow whether open blaem, or secret prison sweet: In theas extreams and haest is moest, for present myscheef meet. The Freer to find som reddy help, was pleasd and well a payd: So in the cheast this great wies man, is crept ful soer afraid. She lokt the same, and clapt the keys, close vnder bolstor suer: So layde her down apon the bed, and did soer fits enduer. Or faynd to feell about hir brest, sutch grieps she sayd she felt: The groening of the same did make, her husbands hart to melt. How now deer wife, what ayleth thee, the simple soule sayd than: Fie wief pluck vp a womans hart, yea husband God knoes whan. Quoth she if Aquauite now, I drinke not out of hand: I haue a stitch so soer godwot, I can nor sit nor stand. Thou hast a bottell in the house, I daer well say ? he: Of aquauite laetly boght, thear maye no better be. Within thy cheast, where are thy keyes, I kno not by my life: Said she, you set moer by a lock, than you do by your wief. Ye wus and you wear sicke I should, the locke right soen vp break: That shalbe don (? he) you need, therof no moer to speak. A Hatchet toek he in his hand, and stroek hit sutch a bloe: The Chaember shackt, the Freer he quaekt, and stonk for fear and woe. The Cheast with Iron barrs was bound, which made the goodman sweat: The Freer like doctor Dolt lay still. in dreed and danger great. (And durst not siur for all the world,) his corrage quite was gon: The poer man had a pig in pock, had he lockt well thear on. The lock was good that knue the wief, who baed her husband strik: He layd on lood the frer with in, that sport did littell liek. At length the hands began to lowse, the wife had eye therto: She feard if he did strike agayn, the locke would suer vndo. Than thought she on a womans wiell, which neuer fayles at need: If Feer wear seen than was she shaemd no, no, she toeks moer heed. O hold your hand you kill my hed, ? she to heer you knock: Now am I easd, great harm it wear, to spill so good a locke. My stitch is gon, than let me sleep, and rest my self a whiell: The goodman went vnto his shop, the wief began to smiell. When she had sent away the boy, all thinges in quiet wear: She roes and went to ease the Freer, that lay half dead for fear. Which resurrection who had seen, must needs haue laught at least: First how he lay, than how he lockt, and trembled like a beast. Nowe am I quit ? she sir Freer, and yet you aer not shaemd: And throw a woman who youe skornd, your folly nowe is taemd. This tael so ends and by the saem, you se what Freers haue byn: And howe theyr outward holly liues, was but a clock for sin. Heer may youe se howe plain poer men, that labors for thear foed: Aer soen disseaud wyth sottel snaeks. of wicked serpents broed Heer vnder clowd of matter light, som words of weight may pas: To make the leawd abhoer fowl lief, and se them selus in glas. Heer is no terms to stoer vp vice, the writtar ment not soe: For by the foill that folly taeks, the wies may blotles goe. The moer wee se the wicked plaegd, and painted plain to sight The moer we pace the paeth of grace, and seek to walk vpright. Finis.

THE VVHOLE ORDER howe oure Soueraigne Ladye Queene Elizabeth, was receyued into the Citie of Bristow, and the speaches spoken before her presens, at her entry, with the residue of versis and matter that might not be spoken (for distance of the place) but sent in a boek ouer the Waetter. [No fleet of foet, nor swift of wyng] At the hie Crosse in a disgised manner stoed Faem very orderly set forth, and spoke as followeth, by an excelent boy. No fleet of foet, nor swift of wyng, nor skarce the thought in brest: Nor yet the Arrowe out of Boe, nor Wynde that seld doth test. Compaers with me quick worlds report, that som calls Flying Faem: A bruet of prayes, a blast of pomp, a blazer of good naem. The only lawd that Kyngs do seek, a Ioy to eatch estaet: A welcom freend that all men loues, and noen a liue doth haet. Saluets the Queen of raer renowne, whose goodly gifts deuien: Throw Earth and Ayre with glory great, shall passe this tromp of mien. And knowyng of thy commyng heer, my duetty had me goe: Before vnto this present place, the nues therof to shoe. No soenner was pronownst the name, but Baebs in street gan leap: The youth, the age, the ritch, the poer, cam runnyng all on heap. And clappyng hands, cried maynly out, O blessed be the owre: Our queen is comming to the town, with princely trayn and powre. Than collors cast they oer the wawls, and deckt old howsis gaye: Out flue the bags a bout afayrs that long a hording laye. Asid they set thear townishe trashe, and works of gredy gayen: And tornd thear toils to sports and mirth, and warlike pastimes playn. As shalbe seen to morn in feeld, if that your highnes pleas: Whear duetie haeth deuiesd by art, a shoe on land and seas To vtter matter yet vnknown, that shall explayned be: By sutch dom sights and shoes of war, as thear your grace shall se. Thus subiects means to honor prince, whoes sight they haue enioyd Moest glad hit is thear hap to haue, thear saruice so employd. [All hayll, O plant of grace] Salutacion the first boy. All hayll, O plant of grace, and speshall sprout of faem: Most welcom to this Western coest, O Perll and princely daem. As loe, a custom is, whear humble subiects dwels: When Prince aprocheth neer their vew, for ioy to ryng their bels. So all that beareth lief, in Bristow now this day: Salutes the Queen from deepth of breast, with welcom euery way. And wee poer silly boyes, that cam from skoell of laet: Reioyce and clap our hands withall, as members of thy staet. Our dueties heer to shoe, and further moer in deed: Thear is a cause whearfore we say, thy helpyng hand we need, Here is O mightie Queen, in way of myrth and sport: A matter moud tween Peace and warre, and therfore buylt a Fort. Dissenshon breeds the brawll, and that is Pomp, and Pried: The Fort on law and order stands, and still in peace would bied. The Warrs is wicked world, as by his fruet is seen: The Fortres representith peace, and takes thy part O Queen. It seems the Gods haue sent, in this great quarell now: A noble Iudge that shall with speed, decied the matter throw. [Yea suer this is a sien] Gratulation the second boy. Yea suer this is a sien, that all the gods aboue: Taks part with vs and freely heer, doth men and childern loue, In sutch a sharp conflyct, to send so suer a staye: That shall surfeace Bellonas brags, and end our fearfull fray. A sottell Snack of laet, with sopple sugred words Haeth sleely crept in brestes of men, and drawn out naked swords And with his wrangling taells, haeth stoerd vp strife ynoughe: And drawn the marchant from his traed, and plowman from the ploughe Disenshon is his naem, that all this mischeef breeds Who still with drosse and roemish dregs, blinde peoples humour feeds: And maks them mortall sick, and sway somtims asied: With wicked warrs, and wilfull brawls, that should with peace abied. But yet O peerles Prince, a true and loyall flock: Agaynst the prowd presomtuous minds, are bent to stand the shock. And swears by sacred Gods, not oen within this soyll: But reddy aer with lesse of lief, to giue thy foes a foyll. For proef the feble youth, and baebs of tender aeg: Daer draw their swords, in this attempt, to corb disorders raeg. Sens Englands hoep is com, to payse these things in brest: We daer not stay her longer heer, whose trauell craueth rest. [Yet if the Prince wold stay, or if men might make choice] Obedient good will, the thyrd boy, who could not speak time was so far spent. Yet if the Prince wold stay, or if men might make choice Of oen no bigger than my self, to speak in Citties voice I would declaer in deed, what deep desier they haue, To spend their goods, their landes &amp; lius, her staet in peace to saue But sens the time is short, &amp; Prince to lodging goes I say god bles our Queen y? gius, the whit &amp; fayr red Roes. The Speech at the Colledge. Dissencion to the Citie to moue them to arms, hath his speeches as these things wear don in action. You subiects that desierd to se, this gladsom preshos Ieam: Behold lo heer the only Ioye, and iuwell of the Ream. A Prince in deed of princely minde, that Princis loues and fears: Whose passyng hed, yea all the staets, of christen princis bears. And throughly sees and locks into, as though a man might say: Heer is the toutchstoen for the Gold, the Piller, Prop, and stay. Of eury region far or neer, that to vs neyghbors aer: How mutch is this poer Colledg bound, in naked buildyngs baer. For to receyue so bright a Star, as clouds can skarce contayn: Who for to se so small a Sell, hath taken so great payn. The Pieps and Organs of our harts, shall yeld thee thank therfore: By sound of Psalm, and sollemp Immes, yea could poer Preests do moer. The Musicke that thy Chapel maks, should be so sweet and shrill. Might lull asleep the Musis all, and shaek Pernasoes hill. The Songe. O happy ower of blis, O Colledg thou dost se: The shado gon, the substance com, nay Sun doth shien on thee. Away you bosum Snaeks, that sowes dissenshon heer: Go make your neasts, whear Serpents breed, this soyll and coest is clear. Enchant no man with charms, ye shall receyue check maet: If that you play with paltring pawns, before so great a staet. She hateth Hidras heds, and lous the harmles mind A foe to vice, a frend to grace, and bent therto by kind Which grace and grashos god, now gied her whear she goes: With treble grace throw troblous time, to tread on all her foes. [O people vayn, that spends in peace your dayes] Dissension to peace (which was the mayn Fort) speaketh in a furie these words that follow. O people vayn, that spends in peace your dayes To prowl about, for pens and piuish pealf And maks no count, of Faem and poblik prayes So eatch man liues, like Prince within him self. And so posses, the pleasures on this mold, The Iuwels braue, the gay and glittryng gold, You caer not what, great glory elders won Nor who at first, the worthy warres begon. You sleep and snort, in sweet perfumed sheets, And hug your heds, in harber warm and gay, Whearby in deed, ye haue sutch heauy spreets, You can not se, the goodly sunny day, No though the clouds, the Son, the Moen and al Wear reddy now, apon your heds to fall, You wold not, moue, nor seek your selus to saue On drosse and dong, sutch deep desiers you haue. You heer not how, the enmies at your noes, Aer vp in aerms, and cawls your cowards still You caer not mutch, abroed how matters goes Whan that at hoem, ye want no wealth nor will Clap corrage on, and cast long gowns asied Pluk vp your harts, and fling down pomp and pried Make Idell hands, and heds in heels that lurk For worthy lawd, com forth and learn to work. A corslet fien, is worth ten skarlet goowns A blast of faem, sormounts all things you wear Call lusty ladds, to spend your spared crowns The warrs aproetch, tis time the boyes wear thear If you abied, at hoem till Cannons reer The plaester coms, to laet to salue the seer Break downe the banks, that holds the water in First strik thy foe, and so the brawll begin Put fyer to strawe, and make the fornayes hot: And bid them crie, that borns thear fingers first Yea cast on wod, to boyll the browes pot And let them starue, that wants to coell thear thirst: When world is wield, and all is set a gog A mans a man, and than a doggs a dogg: Aduise you now, my dwelling is not heer I must pack hens, another stern to steer. [Giue ear good maets, and mark full well] Now dissension went to the warrs which was set out in open vew (with all orders of marshall manner) and spake as follows. Giue ear good maets, and mark full well, the tidings that I bring: For I wilbe a larum bell, that in your earres shall ring. A pestlens peall of rumor strang, that flies throw many a land: The plain report whearof remains in me dissenshons hand If I keep cloes that I do knoe, and stoer no clapper now The hargaboz, the bill and boe, will seartch your corraeg throw Trust this for trouth that peace is bent, to trus vp soldiors all: Wealth wil no warrs, peace is so prowd, the people fears no fall. They bragg and boest thear treasuer can, torn eatch thing how they list: For eury staet is wone with wealth, as hawk stowps don to fist. A mas of gold will porchace peace, and mak wield wantons taem: If warrs wear wod and waxed mad, and hot as fiery flaem: Peace ruells the earth, and wrings thear thombs that raging reuell maks: Yea play what gaem ye list they saye, that peace doth swep the staeks: Peace is the prince that gouerns all, and saith a fig for war: Yea peace will put you all in pownd, and mak you stand at bar. Peace calls you roges, and swashing dicks, that stand apon your braues: A swarm of wasps, a flok of wolus, a neast of theeus and knaues That lius by spoyll and morthers viell, and triumps still in bloed. And haue sutch hot and greedy minds, you thirst for neibors goed. The Trompets lowd that slaughter sownds, and drums with rombling noyes: Was neuer maed for men of peace, but rather fit for boyes. They saye whoes childhoed liks fond bruets, and lous sutch trifling toyes: Will you that kingdoms conquerd haue, be now subdued by peace Shall seuill swains to loethsom gaiell, lead men lik doggs in leace. Shall piuysh peace and peple weak, oer com the soldiour stout: Shall loytrarrs lewd lik rebells raill, and manhoed wax a lowt Ah fie for shame set hand on sword, in your behalf I bloeshe. Bid trompet sownd aduance the piek, and giue prowd peace of poesh. [Eskaept from waltryng waues] M. Iohn Robarts of the Temple. Eskaept from waltryng waues, from sword and fier, and enmies sleight: From storms and sturdy flaws, from roeryng shot and fearfull fight. I com to quiet land, whear noble Prince doth pastims vew: And bryng a boek in hand, of all the shoes, and matter trew. That must by practies pas, before your highnes as it fauls: And suerly sent I was, by those that keeps your warlike wauls. To craue your curteys ayd, in their defence that peace desiers: Whoes staet is maed afrayd, by fals dissenshons kindled fiers. As your poer people haue, throw peace possest great gayn and good: So still sutch peace they craue, as may avoyd the losse of blood. As heer I cam a mayn, so haue I promesd if I may: For to retorn agayn, throw salt sea foem the saem self way. [No greef so great, nor soer so mutch] Perswasion to the Citie, called the Mainfort. No greef so great, nor soer so mutch, but finds at length som rest: As Warrs begins by wrath of God, so Peace is counted blest. Yet Warres is suer, a needfull thyng, for mans offence, A scorge: A Salue to heale the sinfull soule, and for the staet A porge. That skowrs the body of the Realm, and kyngdoms all throw out: And leaues vnseartcht no member suer, that walks this world about. Wear not the woe that wars doth bring, sweet peace should seem full sower The netels sharp and wiked weeds, sets forthe a pleasant flower. By sinnes pangs we iudg what health, and quiet rest is worth And out of payn is pleasuer found, as Gold from dros coms forth. The harms, the haps, and cruell claps, that warrs and Cannon bryngs: Maks Princis seek the fear of god, and subiects kno thear kings Thogh peace in deed dispiseth warrs, as plainnesse falshed haets: Yet warlik people aer enbraest, and liekt of all estaets. The knief that cuts the finger soer, in sheath about is born: The sword that takes away the life, makes peace whear it is worn The are that heaweth down the tree, is needfull for mans lief: Thus proue I as mans help or harms, remains in sword and knif? So warrs whear they aer vsed well, keeps world in fear and awe: And shoes moer terror by his raeg, than al your ruells of lawe. Sens Cayn slue Abell warrs haeth bin, Note.twen bretheren as we reed And soldiors hath bin wagid well, as world of warrs stoed need: Than snair not for the faem they snatch, nor brell to her thear bruit. When broyls haue sowne ill seedes of caer, peace reapes from warres good fruet. And learns a lesson worthy gold, which Peace holds deer of price: And maks therof a mirrour bright, to vew and sift out vice. The Battayll ends whear conquest coms, and when great charge is spent: For peace the post with Pakket goes, Embastars els aer sent? To knit the knot and make a Leag, thus all the brawls that bee: Do bend to peace, and Wisdoms boe, how ear foels bolts do flee. Whearfore agree with Warres in haest, you se what quarels aer: And how that Warres bryngs wo and waest, and leaues a kyngdom baer. The people spoyld, the howsis bornt, the freends and neighbour slayn: The giltles plaegd and eatch man wrongd, whear rage and war doth rayn. [Dissention first that cald to mind] The Cities answer to Perswasion. Dissention first that cald to mind, our old foerfathers faem: (And ript out seams of patched prayes, skarce worth the noet or naem.) Brought Peace and War in this vproer, our ruels sutch brawls demes: Our traed doth stand on Siuill lief, and thear our glory lies. And not on strief the ruen of staets, a storm that all destroys A heauy bondage to eatch hart, that fredoms fruet enioyes. Our orders maks the roister meek, and plucks the prowd on knees The liif and stobborne kno the yoek, and roets vp rotten trees. That may iniect a fruetfull feeld, what can be sweet or sownd: But in that soyl whear for offence, is due correction fownd. Wee make the siuill lawes to shien, and by example mield. Reform the rued, rebuek the bold, and tame the contrey wyeld We venter goods and lius ye knoe, and trauill seas and land. To bring by trafick heaps of wealth, and treasuer to your hand We aer astay and stoer howse boeth, to kingdoms farr and neer. A cawse of plentie throw foersyght, whan things wax scarce and deer: And thoghe our ioy, be moest in peace, and peace we do maintain. Whear on to prince and realm throw out, doth ries great welth and gain: Yet haue we soldyars as you see, that stoers but whan we pleas And sarus our torns in how shold things, and sits in shop at eas. And yet daer blaed hit with the best, when cawse of contrey coms And cals out courage to the fight, by sound of warlike Droms. We Marchants keep a mean vnmixt, with any tarryng part: And bryng boeth Treble and the Baess, in order still by art. A Souldiour shalbe liked well, if his dezarts be sutch: A noble mind for noble acts, shall suer be honord mutch. But if men glory all in warres, and peace disdayns in deed: We skorn with any Siroep sweet, their humour sowre to feed: And blest be God we haue a Prince, by whom our peace is kept: And vnder whom this Citie long, and land hath safly slept. From whom liekwyes a thousand gifts, of grace enioy we do: And feell from God in this her raygne, ten thousand blessyngs to. Behold but how all secrets fien, of falshed coms to light: In these her dayes, and God taks part, with her in troeth and right. And mark how mad Dissenshon thriues, that would set warres abroetch: Who sets to saell poer peoples liues, and gets but viell reproetch. And endles shaem for all their sleights: O England ioy with vs: And kis the steps whear she doth tread, that keeps her countrey thus. In peace and rest, and perfait stay, whearfore the god of peace: In peace by peace our peace presarue, and her long lief encreace. The dolfull a Due. At her highnes departuer a gentilman in the confiens of the Towns liberties spaek this speech that follows. Our Ioy is ioynd with greuous groens, Our triumphe tornd to tears: The brantch whoes blosoms gladnes broght, a bitter berry bears. In howse and street whear mirth was hard, is moen and moorning noies: The sommer day is dimd with clowds, eclypsed aer our ioyes. The loedstar leaus our wished cowrs, and clims the heauens hie: Our sofrant will no longer lord, in walls of Bristow lye. No maruell sins our barrain soyl, and ground of groes deuyce: Haeth yelded no thing that might pleas, a prince of so great price. Our deuties aer not half dischargd, no thoghe we kist the grownd: And prostraet fall full flat on face, whear her foet steps aer fownd. The Persians daer not cast vp eies, nor loek apon thear king Shall Christians then presuem to preace, on sutch a Sacred thyng. And tho no part of duties bownds O god forbid I say: But that the lords anointed should, be honord eury way. Long lockt this Citie for a prince, long sens and many a yeer: A King or Queen beheld this town, short time she taryes heer. Good fortuen folow thee O Queen, god gied thy doings all: A world of threfold blessed happ, apon thy kingdom fall. As loeth to taek our heauy leaue, as leaue our lius in deed: A due deer lady of this land, the liuing Lord thee speed.</field>
