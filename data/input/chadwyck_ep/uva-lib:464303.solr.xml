      <field name="fulltext">An Hymn to God. In thee, we live; moove, Lord, by thee: From thee pure mynds thee-knoweing light derive. How then, save through thy grace, may wee That honour high to sing thy bliss atchieve? Then thow draw vp my lowe desire: And love of thee let noble thoughts inspire. Eternal God! whose boundles time, not led by circling sky, Then former day, now later leves; whence wee som prime descry, Whence first, time gan his coorse; thus parts which may arrange: But thy blest time unmooving stands, ay perfect, void of change, With thee eternal, present all, unknoweing first or last, Deziring nothing yet to com, regretting nothing past. Thow infinite, (great Self-be?ing Lord,) first, highest, pure, unmixt: Vnbounded sole, to all thy woorks wel-mezured bounds hast fixt. That glorious Sun, fair Moon, and Stars, finite since wee doo knowe; Nor Gods themselfs, and made by thee, more glorious Light, may shew. And dread we yet, who serve this Lord, have prov'd his helpful might, Mans, Feends assalts? May earth with pow?r above-celesti?l fight? But Hee, though world conteins and fils, comprended though of none; Yet gracious, to his chozen train, his vieu in supreme throne (Their eys with light of glori encleerd,) pure blessednes, prezents. Abiss of ioy! that thought exceeds; yet woords fresh thought prevents. For thow, Perfection ô entire, perfections all containst: No good, not in thee; above thee, none; whole Good, pure Bliss remainst. What Beauties ey, what mynd delight; what Sweetnes drawth desire; What Maiesties we high revere; what Glorious states admire; What Wisdom richly vests the mynd, and makes it All possess, Redoubling all by right-drawn shapes, what Goodnes things dooth bless, Diffuzing round it self; from thence what Vertues noble spring By woorthi acts to cheer the world, and better age to bring; What Happi life our thoughts conceive; (for ah how small a mite Of happi life we here enioy?) what Ioy, what deer delight, What flagrant Pleasures, full, and mere, in blessed state are found; In thee, great Fountain of them all, united all abound. From thee, as beams from beaut?ous Sun, what ev?r is goodli seen In heav?n or earth; what rich, what fair, what ev?r we loveli deem, And pleazed will alures; from thee, high Cause of All, deriv?d; By thyn aspect is all maintaind; yea dead, by thee reviv?d. That all thy creatures, supreme Lord, thee Goodnes high define: Themselfs from thee agnize; to thee their praises all resign. And dote we still on creatures mene; in their perfections dwell: Nor raize our loves tow?rd Him, who them must thousand folds excell? For as the matchles Sun, though one, imbu?d with vertu high From richnes thyn, in glorious walk brought round the broad-spred sky, And lustring earth; (how poor a clod?) with beams and infl?ence sweet Of sp?rit sublime, dooth various lifes (each grac?d with beauties meet) Through land and sea disperse; hence beasts, hence fish, each crauling thing, Birds, trees, herbs, flours, fruits, spices rare, yea mettals deep respring: All whose perfections, great and mene, in thousand kynds renued Whom thousand graces deck, and yet with vertues more endued, In Sun himself, thy master-woork, Cause whence they all proceed. Must needs excell; not be?ing as here, (not so hast thow decreed,) By matter course, embas?d; empaird, by distance great; by site Oblique, alai?d; diversified, (repugnant that they fight,) By mixtures of ten thousand forms; but there they all refine; Vnite in one; one uniform, high, rich perfection shine: So (glorious Cause of all,) in thee; what lifeful Light in Sun; What Greatnes fair in Heav?ns dooth shine; through Orbs what Beauties run; What Pow?rs, what Vertues nobly rich, Intelligence what cleer, What Wisdom, Freedom, Goodnes sweet, in Angels blest appear; What slagrant Loves, what glorious Ioys, Celesti?l Coorts embless; In thee unite; doost all in one eternally possess, In infinite perfection more, so sort in more sublime. O purenes high, whereto not mans, nor Angels thoughts can clime! For thow, who Beeing art it self; doost Beeings all contain: Perfections all, thence ô deriv?d, more perfect there remain. Then Lord, from thee sith all proceed; to thee in iust desire They bend: at thee, whence first they came, Content they last require. For thow, First Cause; Great End of all. What ever true rest affects, Perfection his what e're dooth seek, what happi state expects; Thee, Lord, ô thee it still purs?eth: som beam of bliss divine, As due from bounti thyn it craves. Ev?n senseles creatures thyn, Through natures force inclin'd by thee, woork out their Beeing best, And place preserving seek. But man, with understanding blest, And Sp?rits celesti?l, strive to knowe thee: who knowne, doost Love alure. (Growe Knowelege; Love wil growe.) True love, dooth woorthi harts procure Thy will to woork, thy Laws to keep: which kept, thow doost requite With high Reward, with God himself. Here blest with glorious sight, They thee enioy; to thee with love (Eternal Bliss) adhere. O sourse of ioys! Tow?rd which our hope (unwoorthi though) we rear; And thee, ah thee pursue. Thow Lord, in mortal life belowe, (Where hundred snares our soules beset, where sin dooth all oreflowe,) Conduct us with thy grace; and safe to life immortal bring: With Angels, where triumphant wee shal ay thy praises sing. SACRED HYMNS. Psalm 1. [O blessed wight! whose pure desires to stain] O blessed wight! whose pure desires to stain Th'ungodli crue in vain their counseils bend; In vain doo sinners ways his absence plain; And scorners chairs in vain their poison spend: Th'Eternals law hath rapt his whole delight; Th'eternal law he muzeth day and night. AS precious plant; whom iuiceful veins doo fat, Due fruits enrich, unfading leafs doo grace; (The Masters ioy, fair honour of the plat:) So righteous man; whom blessings round embrace. While wicked imps, as rootles fruitles chaf; Which whirled round, the wynd seems cauze to laugh. THERFORE when sov?rain Iudge of he?vens and land By final doom shal destin to each his place: The iust shal shine, and glorious senat stand; When damned rout shal fly his dreadful face. For righteous path th'alrighteous Lord advows: But track perverse tow?rd dire destruction bows. Psalm 2. [What graceles fears, strange hates, may Nations so affright] What graceles fears, strange hates, may Nations so affright, Infuriate so; gainst God with mad attempts to fight? Gainst God, and gainst his Christ, earths Kings and Peers shal band, To force ioyn fraud, (ah fools!) He?vens kingdom to withstand. Fond, earthi mynds! ye hate your bliss: Gods gracious hests, Free laws, as thrauling tys, your lawles life detests. BVT Hee in he?vens that sits, whose ey their thoughts divides; Their wicked mynd abhors; their vain attempts derides. He then in wrath shal speak; in wrath which sore shal vex, And with distracted thoughts their troubled mynds perplex. And then shal glorious voice from he?venli throne proceed; Lo here my Son, a King to sacred Si?n decreed. THEN this decree I'le shew: God spake it first to Mee; My Son thou art: this day have I begotten thee. Thy kingdom shal encrease: Ask me; and Gentile lands; Yea utmost ends of earth, I'le render to thy hands. VVhom thou, obdur'd in sin, with rod of ir?n shalt bruze: As earthen pot shalt crash, while they thy laws refuze. THEN ô, advize ye kings; and ye instruction take Who Iudges are of earth, your iudgements right to make. Serve God with fear: (with fear best wisdom is begon:) With dread your ioys asse?zon. Then homage to his Son With kiss prezent: So so his kindling ire prevent, Which them and all their ways, gainst whom least spark is bent, With horrour dire consumes. But blessed ay the wight Who trusts in him; to him who sacred faith hath plight. Psalm 8. [Eternal Lord; th'illustrous fame] Eternal Lord; th'illustrous fame That sounds through world thy glorious name! Whose greatnes fair transcends the skys; Whose goodnes earth dooth not despize. Ev?n tender lips of infants yong Thy grace inspires with praiseful song: Whose force thy foes revengeful rage All danted strangely dooth asswage. WHEN vp my wondring eys I raize Tow?rd higher coorts which preach thy praise; The he?vens so huge, the stars so bright, That Prince of day, this Queen of night; All which doo thee their maker knowe, Of peerles hand the matchles showe: Lord, what is man, poor clot of mold, That him in mynd thou still shouldst hold; Or son of man, defiled worm, Thy gracious thoughts tow?rd him to turn! A LITTLE thou wilt man abbase, Beneath thy blisful Angels place: Then ay shal man remain renoumd, With prime of glori princely cround. To him as King thy creatures bow, And dueti prest shal ioyful vow: What e're against his scepter swell, His powrful foot thou doun mak?st quell. THE cattle myld his service bear: Yea beasts most wyld his frouns doo fear: What flying wing the air divides, What swimming fin through water glides, What creeping thing in sea or land, Hast all subiected to his hand. O Lord, our Lord; what glorious fame Resounds through world thy gracious name! Psalm 15. [Lord: who shal in thy roial tent reside?] Lord: who shal in thy roial tent reside? Whom shal thy sacred mount his dweller claim? The man whose feet in paths direct abide; Whose lips at trueth, whose hands at iustice aim. NO wronging tale his tong hath twynd; no deed Of his hath neighbour harmd; yea slander vile Gainst neighbour raiz'd, which itching ears dooth feed, With stern rebuke his righteous ears exile. THE godles wretch, from he?venli coort reiected, As foe, he shuns; as outcast base, despizeth: The godli wight, by grace divine elected, As frend, he loves; as precious, highly prizeth. HIS woord as oath, his oath as sacred vow, He firm observes; though harm he thence endure: Usurious trade, the idles biting plow, Ne gain nor ease can him to hold alure. THE upright cause, sole obiect of his sight, No bribe can hurt, no present needs to mend: So hee the man, whom nought shal shake or fright; Whom sacred place, and blisful ioys attend. Psalm 16. [Then thow preserve me, Lord, thou anchor of my mynd] Then thow preserve me, Lord, thou anchor of my mynd; My wandring thoughts no rest save in thy favour fynd. Thee, thee my soule hath ch?zen, thee vowd hir Lord to bee: Though service myn I knowe can nothing ad to thee. Yet to thy servants may; in whom thy gifts excell; Terrestrial Saints; midst whom my high delights doo dwell. BVT sorroes them befall, yea heaped plagues oppress; VVho gifts from thee to dum or damned gods address. Their murdring sacrifice shal never soil my face: Their Gods accursed names my lips shal never grace. THOW art my God, my Lord; the portion I love best; My health, and wealth; my ioy; my bliss, and glorious rest. And thow my earthli lot, in place both rich and pure, A goodli seat, shalt long to mee and myn secure. THE Lord with thankful praise my humble mynd adores, VVho mee with counseil deep in nightli muzing stores. For him before me ay my faithful eys engrave: He at my right hand stands, from falling me to save. VVHERFORE my hart with ioy, my sp?rit exults in praise: And soule hir dying flesh in hopeful rest doun-lays. For not my soule beneath exil'd thou'lt leue from thee: Ne let thyn HOLI ONE impure corruption see. But paths of life wilt shew, which to thy presence bring; VVhere fullest ioys for ay, and purest pleasures spring. Psalm 17. [High Iudge of world, cast doun thy right?ous eys] High Iudge of world, cast doun thy right?ous eys; Attentive hear, while right for iustice humbly crys. Not causeles fear, nor sleight of faining lips, Or needles douts prezents, or plot disguis?d uprips: Iust grief appeals; and sentence from thy face, Of thee craves due redress: thou then iust plea embrace. THOU oft my soule, yea oft in night didst vieu; When thoughts in silent rest prezent appearance true: And oft my hart with firi storms hast seen Dissolv'd; and trial made what dross therein hath been. Nought counterfeit, no palliate thing hast found: What secret mynd dooth think, that mouth dooth truly sound. All as my woords, so deeds tow?rd men doo frame: Thy sacred woord my rule: the vi?lent wrongers blame, I see, and shun. O still my feet contain In right?ous paths; stil hands from acts not iust restrain. THEE Lord I call: for sure thou wilt me hear: Ah then receive the plaint which faithful soule dooth rear. Divide thy acts: display thy mercies free, (Thou Saviour of thy Saints from those who them and thee With wicked hate attempt): as light of ey Me fenced, under, Lord, thy shad?ing wing let fly. There let me rest; there safe from impious crue, My deadli foes, protect: who circling rage renue, My strength to wast, my life to earth to bring; Engrosd with fat; and proud, out thundring threats doo ring. As Lion fierce, with ireful hunger whet, Flings out his prey to seek; which ioious having met, Stands foming rage: or else as Lions whelp, Who coucheth close in cave, his strength with sleight to help, Nor bold, nor yet afraid: so Lord my foes, Now round with ramping troops our ways and walks enclose, Prezenting death: and now with spiteful ey, Doun-cast, dissembling leer, advantage to espy. THEN Lord arize, and with encounter swift Affront their savage looks: and bloud since is their drift, Midst wicked troops, that bloud may bloud repay, To save us by thy hand, with swoord mowe doun thy way. SO Lord from men, my grieving soule enfree, From men of baser world: who here we beast-like see In fading life their portion all posses; And panches vile, their God, from thy rich storehouse bless. Like sire, like son: same coorse their ofspring runs; Ful gorge themselues; what's left, that to their infants comes. BVT I, by faith, in right?ous life, shal vieu Thy gracious face. And when thy pow?r shal death subdue; Awakened, Lord, eternal glorious sight Of semblance thyn, me like, shal fill with pure delight. Psalm 19. [The he?vens declare the glori of God; that worlds great arch foorth-tels] The he?vens declare the glori of God; that worlds great arch foorth-tels, “His handi woork we are himself who thousand he?vens excels. Both day to day resounds these woords, and night to night inures This knowelege high; which vieuing ey to muzing mynd assures. No speach, no language under sky, which hath not heard their voice: Their woords through earth to ends of world run rul?d with glorious noise. HE here the Sun in bour hath plac?d: the Sun, like bridegrome brave Who coming foorth, like Giant stout to run his race dooth crave. His course from utmost end of he?ven he takes, and round amain By mighti compas to' utmost end of he?ven returns again. His glist?ring rays all guild the world: no less his quicning heat, What earth, what air, what sea containth, cheers up with comfort great. GODS law is perfect; soules to him restoring it betakes: His testimoni is sure in woork; and wife ev?n children makes. Gods iustify?ngs are sound and straight; to raize the hart with ioy: His mandates cleer; from clouded eys to chase their dark annoy. The fear of God is pure; and keeps from dire corruption free: His iudgements all as true and iust, of he?vens adored bee: More woorth desire then treasures huge of pearl and finest gold; More sweet then sweetest food which Bee in curious cels dooth hold. THEN Lord, behold, thy servant warn'd, to keep thy law dezires: Dezires thy law to keep; which kept, to high reward aspires. Then thow inspire thy grace: and Lord, (for who his falts can knowe?) To clenze my stains through sins unknowne thy gracious merci showe. But strange presumpt?ous sins keep off, that those may never raign: So from the great defecting sin I cleer shall ay remain. And so my woords from humble lips, my thoughts from thankful hart, Thou shalt accept; O Lord, my strength, redeemer myn that art. Psalm 20. [In day of tro?ble, o woorthi king] In day of tro?ble, o woorthi king; God cheer thee; thence high valure spring: And mighti name of Iacobs Lord, Protect from stroke of hostile swoord. That day from sacred throne to thee On Angels wings aid he?venli flee: And strength, by prostrate Church implor?d, From Si?n great Ark be fresh restor?d. THY prai?r stil pierce his gracious ears, As pious soule it humbly rears: Thy gifts his eys benign receave; And offrings burnt all cinders leave. His light illustrate so thy face; So favour his thy ways entrance; That wish of hart, that woork of brain, Succesful end stil blest attain. THVS wee, enfreed from feard annoy, For safeti thyn, our deerest ioy, All thankful shall Gods praises sing; And glorious name to heav?ns upring. Yea when thy prai?rs his pow?r performs, And thee victorious (ô) returns: We banners, ensigns of his praise, And trophes to his great name wil raize. O FAITH assur?d; inspyrd from high! Now knowe I, God, ev?n God drawth nigh: Our King, the Lords anointed deer, Celestial sanctu?ri dooth hear. There see I, aid diuine decreed, To save his pers?n in hours of need: There Victori, by Gods right hand, By pow?r gainst which no pow?r can stand: SOME charrets make their strength and grace: In horses som proud glori place. Fond ioy, false strength! at thundring call, Horse, charrets, men, to ground doo fall. We then to he?vens address our ey, Where surer trust faiths eys descry: A trust, which, whil?st they doun are brought, Our standing strength and tri?mph hath wrought. Then hear vs, Lord: let heav?ns great king Our king on earth home safely bring. Psalm 21. [The King, (Lord,) tow?rd thy glorious face] The King, (Lord,) tow?rd thy glorious face Victorious eys dooth ioyful rear: His strength, thy sp?rit; his health, thy grace; With doubled tri?mphs his soule dooth chear. What hart could wish, what lips did crave; Thy bount?ous hand him strangely gave. YEA wh?ther his thoughts had n?ver aspyr'd, Thy blessing roial him prevents: Of purest gold croun undesyr'd To humble head rich hand prezents. Then life he ask'd: thou long to live Yea life eternal didst him give. WHAT maiesti on earth can shine; What woorship mortal man may grace; What glori, only not diuine; Thy goodnes all on him dooth place. That him all ages, pattern rare Of matchles bliss, shal ay declare. THEN ioy his thankful hart hath fraught; Which from thy face serene derives: Which firm affi?nce hath likewise wrought: Which ioy again stil fresh revives. For sith the King in th'High?st dooth trust; Thou'rt safe; ô King; ô High?st, thou'rt iust. For as on thyn thy love is sign'd: So powrful hand those monsters dire, Which hate the sov?rain good, shal fynd; And found, confound in day of ire. As firi furnace they shal fume; Which kindled once dooth self consume. WITH cursed sires, corrupted seed, From face of earth thou shalt destroy. For spite gainst thee their brains doo breed: Vain spite, which woorks but self-annoy. As mark, their faces thou shalt lay; On which thy winged shafts may play. O THOW, who euerlasting reins Of world almighti Guid doost sway; Advance thy strength; and proud disdains Of miscr?ants vyld great Lord repay. So we thy pow?r shal sing and praize; Which foes dooth quell, thy servants raize. Psalm 22. [My God, my God: why doost thou me forsake?] My God, my God: why doost thou me forsake? Why to my plaints thyn ear a stranger make? By day I cry, but thou far off art gone: By night, deer Lord; but audience fynd I none. YET Holi Lord, thou same doost stil endure; Thyn Israels ioy; their song of praises pure. Our Fathers, Lord, in thee did faithful trust; On thee they hop?d: Thou to their hopes wert iust. They cry'd; and tears did not shour doun in vain: Their crys thou heard'st; and freedst them from their pain. BVT I, a worm; not man; but mans reproach: Where abiects vyld their basest scornings broach. What ey me vieuth, same ey dooth me deride: They wag proud heads; false lips they wryth aside; He trusts in God; Let God from he?ven above Make good this trust, and now declare his love. TRVETH, Lord; my hope from mothers brest thou wast: Then hopes sure ground, thy gracious promise past. From mothers womb I rest bequeathd to thee: Thence me receiv'dst; my Saviour (Lord) to bee. THEN saving Lord, sith tro?ble dooth press so neer, (Ah tro?ble vntryd,) and no where help appear: Be thow not far: See Lord, what buls are met; Huge buls of Basan round haue me beset: With gaping iaws, much lion-like they play, Which ramps to seaze, and roars to rend his pray. SEE, vital iuice to watri stream distild: My bones disioint: my hart, with anguish fild, Like melting wax consumes: as fire-burnt clay My sp?rits being dryd, lifes vigours all decay. Yea with?ring tong to parched chops dooth cleve: Thus me, my Lord, in dust of death doost leve. FOR dogs have mee besieg?d: A savage rout Of vyld malfactours mee env?ron about. Hands, Feet, they'ue pierc'd: my bones may all be told: Which gazing eys from flinted harts behold. My robe vnript amongst them they divide: And seamles cote by chancing lot decide. BVT thow, my Lord, in weakest state my strength, My hope in death; look doun, release at length From heav?ns award: my life from swoord discharge; From pow?r of dog my desolate soule enlarge. From lions mouth; from un?corns horns, with speed, Now hear?st, ô save, in soules extremest need. THY glorious name I'le preach to brethren deer: And faithful Church, in midst, thy praise shal hear From thankful voice resound. Ye sons of grace, Who fear your Lord; and thow great Isra?ls race, Lov?d Iacobs seed; your rev?rend ioys enhance: His praise through earth, his name to heav?ns advance. FOR not with scorning mynd, or loathing ey, Th'afflicted wight he careles passed by: Ne helpful face from rueful sight did hide: But gracious ear to iust complaint applyd. Then vows I'le pay before them which thee fear: And sacred praise assembli great shal hear. THE spirits myld, whom dews celestial bless, Shal fruits of earth in plent?ous rest possess. Their gracious zele Gods glorious praise shal sing: Your ended life shal life unending bring. YEA, nati?ns all which earths great globe doo fill, Ev?n kindreds which hir bounds extremest till, At length themselves remember shal, and mourn, Till whom they left, to him again they turn. To mighti king, whose woord whole world dooth wield, Thus worship due shal world united yield. FOR him all states shal serve: On earths great store The rich shal feed, and heav?ns great Lord adore: And poorest wretch, who doun in dust doth ly, To him shal bow; and dying, death defy; This course great ages run. Their post?rous race In worlds cleer vieu his service shal embrace. And so transmit, that childrens children ay His iustice learn, his sacred will obay. Psalm 25. [To thee his faithful soule thy servant, Lord, dooth rear] To thee his faithful soule thy servant, Lord, dooth rear: My God, my trust: ô dain hir humblest suits to hear. And let not black disgrace my lifes pure light obscure; And frustrate hope proud foes insulting ioys alure. Let none who thee attend, abasing shame depress: Depress it those, thy law who causeles ah transgress. IN LIGHTEN Lord my soule so with thy guiding grace, That I thy trueth may fynd, and found may firm embrace, Revele thy paths divine: ô thow my Savi?ur deer: To thee perennal hope, eternal love adhere. THOSE gracio?s mercies, Lord, which from thy goodnes spring, And ay thy woorks orespred, to myndful presence bring. And from thy sight remoove, the wyldnes of my youth, The sins age more mature with sad remorse pers?eth. O thow who goodnes art! ev?n for that goodnes sake, With merci mee behold, so soules iust grief asslake. MOST righte?us gracious Lord! He sinners shew'th his way; To humble mynds, myld sp?rits, his iustice will display. All trueth, yea merci all, his paths to them remain, His witnest will who seek, and cov?nant great maintain. Then for thy gracious name, propiti?us mee behold: My sin (ah Lord, how great?) in merci great upfold. THRISE happi man, whose hart Gods sacred fear endues: For him shal grace direct, to bliss right way to chooze. And here his soule at ease midst blessings rich shal sit: And goods wel got, secure, to childrens seed transmit. These heav?nli leaug partake: yea misteries high, conceald From worldli wits, to them from heav?n shal be reveald. O THEN my waiting eys, on God stil fixed bee: For hee from snaring net my feet wil right?ous free. Turn then at length thy face, in bliss who sitst on high; Since poor abandond wretch to onli thee dooth fly. Ah Lord; as wave dooth wave, so wo dooth wo pursue: As day dooth day, fresh griefs so griefs forepast renue. But thow, my streits, my pain, my labours, Lord, respect: And on my sins, their cause, ah merci, Lord, reflect. BEHOLD my raging foes; how thick their musters growe, Whose pois?ned gals, uncausd, with bitt?rest hate oreflowe. But thow, Preserver great, my soule from force uniust, My face from shame protect: who liv?st my onli trust! My onli trust, and hope! on safegard none I build, Save what myn upright cause, and goodnes thyn shal yield. These then my gardi?ns stand. And thow, benign, with mee, Thyn Isra?l deer, great Lord, from pressures all enfree. Psalm 32. [The blessed man; whom spring of boundles grace] The blessed man; whom spring of boundles grace With mercies ey a Father-iudge dooth vieu; Whose crimes and guilt with pardon free efface; Foul stains orehele; so pristin shape renue. Yea thrice he blest; whom, who Creatour kynd All perfect fram?d, declynd dooth not forsake: Dooth not his sins impute; and darkned mynd, Discharg?d of guile, to iustice dooth awake. I WHILST my sin in silent brest conceald, Benumbd, asham'd; at length with sicnes scurg?d, My bones consum'd; and roars sharp grief reveald, Which tiring pain, my strength now tired, urg?d. Thy grievous hand stil presd me day and night; Nor Sun could cheer, nor darknes rest prezent: On faded face deaths name seemd palenes write; So native iuice unnative heat had spent. ADVIS'D, I then to thee my sins confesd, In vain conceald; bade idle vail adieu: I said, Be now to God my falts expresd; Who guilt from soule, strait plague from corps withdrew. O GRACIOVS Lord, therfore our hopes abound: And godli men, excited by these fruits, In time accepted, when thou maist be found, With faithful harts shal bring their needful suits. And thow benign, from worlds tempest?ous seas Wilt them remoove: and mee, (my hiding place,) Preserv?d from wrack, discharg?d of streit unease, With ioious crys of freedom round embrace. THEN I, who e're Gods service doost profess, Wil make thee sci?nt, what paths thou must ascend; What dounfals shun; how errors to redress: And guiding ey thy cariage shall attend. BVT men by kynd, transform not into guise Of sturdi horse, or more unthankful mule; Whose brutish brests no mut?al duties prize; Sole sharpest bits their mouths from mischief rule. THE wicked hart, whole swarms of woes shal seaze; Of help without, within of rest depriv?d; While faithful soule, who gracious Lord shal pleaze, With mercies fenc?d, with ioys shal be reviv?d. THEN right?ous mynds, divorce your careful fear; Gods woord who trust, shout out with sounds of ioy; His ways who walk, your hopeful heads vprear: Your light appears, sad darknes to destroy. Psalm 34. [The Lord for ev?r with humblest ioy my thankfulst thoughts shal bless] The Lord for ev?r with humblest ioy my thankfulst thoughts shal bless; In him my soule triumph; my mouth his glorious praise express. Let myld &amp; righte?us mynds, earths Saints, with gladnes hear this praise: Yea all vnite, harts, sp?rits, and sounds, to he?vens his name to raize. When chas?d from home, in strangers land, midst Hethen crue, I moornd, And sought my God; my sighs he heard, and safely mee returnd. That mee his Saints example great shal cheerful ay recite; This poore man cryd, the Lord him heard, and freed from hostile spite. O THOUGHT-surmounting grace! to earth from he?venli host descends Gods Angel great, and servants his as rampire round defends. Then tast, and see, how good the Lord; how sweet his merci flowes; How blest the man who trusts in him, on him vow'd love bestowes. And ye, Gods Saints, his fear maintain: when li?ns through hunger wast; Yet scarsenes none, of no thing good sour want, his servants tast. O COM deer children; listen well, while Gods true fear I teach; How life to win; how length of days in happi?st state to reach. Thy tong from ven?med woords refrain; thy lips let shun deceipt: Decline from ev?l; doo good: seek peace; this this be thy retreit. The eys of God with pleazing vieu the right?ous race behold; Their suits his gracious ears attend; ful deer their lifes are sold: But count?nance stern the mighti Lord gainst proud malfactors bends; And cursed names, corrupted seed, from earths fair bosom rends. TRUE servants plaints iust Lord dooth hear; their tears and fears discharge, Their contrite harts, enanguisht sp?rits, from pressures streit enlarge. Afflictions great, it's true, ful oft most righte?us Man endures: God rids them all: and in their midst his bones from brack assures. No bone of His shal broken be. But those who hate the iust, Shal perish all: the wicked harts owne malice grynds to dust. Their owne desires them plague. But God shal right?ous souls redeem; And none shal quail, to him that trust, who him their life esteem. Psalm 36. [The besti?l mynd, forsaking God, resolv'd to ioy in sin] The besti?l mynd, forsaking God, resolv'd to ioy in sin; To shun remorse, first natures light t'extinguish dooth begin: Then cheers himself in blyndest ways; no vyld desire refrains; Til, in my hart, no dread of God before his eys remains. At length ev?n glori?th in his shame: and ioith (ah wretched state!) Inventing ill; which well adviz'd his trembling soule would hate. DEFYLD, distuned soule! His lips, which ought Gods praises sound, And world with trueth assist; in leud, and lying woords abound. His mynd, of vnderstanding pure, good thoughts, it self depriues: And nought but mischief, fraud, and wrong, on silent bed contrives. In sum, estrang?d from goodnes all, enthral'd to ill; he bends His steps tow?rd death: where vengeance due rebelli?us soules attends. O LORD, what highth, what depth, what bredth, thy greatnes may profess? What hart can goodnes thyn conceive? what tong thy praise express? Thy bounte?us grace from heav?ns to earth thy creatures all comprends: Thy iustice mountains huge surmounts: thy trueth yond clouds extends: A deep abiss thy iudgements rest: O thow doost all protect; Thou man doost save; ne simplest beast in needful things neglect. BVT ô, how precious tow?rd mankynd thy mercies Lord redound? Whence servants thyn thy shad?ing wings their sure retrait have found. And when at last, through ended toils, they at thyn House arrive; There pleasantst food, there sweetest streams, ay pure delights revive. For thow, ô fountain great of life, their life doost still refresh: And beams from thee deriv'd, their eys with sight al-glori?us bless. THEN Lord, hold on thy kyndnes deer, tow?rd those that knowe thy name: And iustice thyn array the soules, whom sacred loves enflame. And let not proud oppressing foot my gracious ways deface: Nor sinning hand misdraw my soule thoughts sinful to embrace. Lo, sinners proud, defecting soules, throwne doun in dreadful guise, In dead destruction ay involv'd, to life shall never rize. Psalm. 37. [Let not unpleazing vieu of bad mens flouring state] Let not unpleazing vieu of bad mens flouring state, Through indignation sour, thy ioious thoughts abate. For doun, like withering grass, they quicly shall be mowne: As bloom of tenderst herb, their flour away be blowne. BUT thow Gods servant true, on him thy Lord rely; In him delight: and thoughts to right?ous woorks apply. Inhabite then the land: thou by thy land shalt live: Yea God thy godli hart his full desires shal give. IF troubles thee assail; to God thy ways commit; And trust to him; who them to happi?st end shal fit. No shame shal thee attaint: thy iustnes, fair as light; And cleer as shining noon, he shall produce thy right. THEN rest on God: his will with patient hope attend. And let not woorthles man, who brings leud thoughts to end, And prospers in his coorse, thy discontent imbreed. Shun wrath, fierce choler rein: great sins from rage proceed. For proud misdoo?r shal rot: while root they lasting take Who humbly wait on God; his law their mirrour make. BVT yet a while; and lo, the wicked shall not bee: His stateli seat, no place for him or his shal see. When as the myld with ioy shal pleasant land possess: Where length of plent?ous peace shal thankful ioy rebless. IT'S true, the right?ous man, whose life ill lifes reprooves; His sight alone ill mynds to deep distemper mooves. That him as publique foe, the godles crues beset: And practise vyld apply, to wrap in snaring net: Yea teeth through felnes gnash. But God shal them deride: Who seeth their day approach, black night to all their pride. Let swoords be drawn, bend bowes, the poor and iust to kill: Bent bowes shal break; drawn swoords the draw?rs best bloud shal spill. AND though som iust be poor, th'uniust with plenti swell: Yet in that one poor house more true content dooth dwel, Then all their pomps can yield. For God shal him maintain: When pride and pow?r uniust with shiv?red arms remain. OUR gracious Lord fit times for all his servants knowes: And now he more, now less, but still their best bestowes. Contin?ance is their bliss: In perilous time, from wrack; In plague, them shields from death; in famin bare, from lack. Whil? ev?n as tenderst fat meer force of smoke consumes: So impious wretch, Gods foe, soon spent to vapour fumes. FOR though th'uniust, by fraud, by force, have much purloind; Yet nothing thrives: (leud gain, hath vain expence adioin'd:) That still a borro?r bare, on neighbours goods he feeds; And none repays. The iust, still rich in vertu?us deeds, From less, but better store, with pitying helpful hand, His wanting neighbour frames Gods goodnes t'understand. For where Gods blessing rests, possessions long shal last: As curse divine, at once, bud, branch, and root, dooth wast. WHERE God mans way dooth pleaze, mans steps he stable makes: Yea fall?n, with succ?ring hand from ground unbruzed takes. I have been yong, am old; yet never knew the iust Forsaken quite; ne're saw his seed in lothed dust Sit craving food: but still his courte?us nature lends; And God his blessing deer to children all extends. Then thus thy thoughts conclude: thyn hart see first be pure; Fly sin; good deeds apply: so so dwel ay secure. For righte?us Lord loves right: he free from wav?ring change, From Saints belov?d dooth ne're his eys serene estrange. But safe through his defence; while impious houses fall; They ancient land possess, there dwell for ever shall. THE righte?us man, whose mynd, cald up from earthli thought, Erect on high, with love of heavenli law is fraught; From harts abundance speaks: His mouth with wisdom floweth; In talk of iudgement grave glad time his tong bestoweth. He nev?r shall slip. For though th'uniust maligner watch Both woords and ways, his life in deadli snare to catch: Yet shall not right?ous Lord him leve in wicked hand; Ne when his iudgement coms, condemned let him stand. SO thow, ô vertu?us soule, thy patient mynd retain; And heav?nli ways insist: in heav?n thy hopes remain. Thy God shal thee exalt: the land shal rest thyn owne; When vndermining wretch thyn ey shal see orethrowne. THESE eys of myn have seen, th'uniust, like self-sprung tree; With arms all gay disspred, in flo?rishing beauti glee. But see the end: he past; and lo, away was gone: The vanisht man I sought; but nues returned none. Now vieu the upright man, observe his sweet encrease: His small in more, his war stil ends in endles peace. Not so defectours proud; who marks of heav?nli ire, At once destroyd, shal nev?r to end dezir?d aspire. BVT from the righte?us Lord stil saving grace descends, Which servants his from wrack in needful hours defends. For God shal them protect, protect from hate uniust; Hee save them, since in him they chooze to place their trust. Psalm 40. [Long patient hope Gods pleasure did attend] Long patient hope Gods pleasure did attend: At length he ear to griev?us cry did bend; And wretch forlorn, who help now no where knew, From miri clay of yelling hole updrew. UPDRAWN, my feet on stateli rock he plac?d; My steps made firm: so now with nue song grac?d, Praise, praise t'our God my thankful glori sounds; Which ech?ing voice with thundring ioy rebounds. For thousands, who revieu my late distress, Which rev?rent trust, tow?rd God cheerd harts address. THEN blessed hee, the Lord who makes his trust: Nor glorious pride, (whom self-loves charming lust Misdraws from God,) with fauning ey respects; Nor thoughts on li?rs fond failing hopes reflects. O LORD, my God; thy gracious thoughts tow?rd man, Are wondrous deep: I would, but no way can, Or thankful them to thee in ray prezent, Or count to men their store and vast extent. WISDOMS abiss! thyn owne ordeined rites, Now sacrifice, now offring, no delights To thee can yield: myn ears hath nüer law So pierc?d that thoughts tow?rd nobler obiect draw. Not sinles beast, nor mene-esteemed life In flames consum'd, may ere compose the strife Wherein mans sin Iustice divine persu?th; Not so thy grace, not so mans bliss renu?th. WEAK shades give place. Then said I, Lo I com: Here Lord: On mee thy blessed will be doon; Sith sacred roll of everlasting book, For mee hath taught worlds waiting eys to look. THY blessed will, sole scope of prudent thought, Iust actions rule, my pleazing cares haue sought To knowe, and doo: thy law in faithful hart Entreas?red lieth; thence never shall depart. NOT silent lips, nor yet vnthankful brest, Thy goodnes, Lord, thou know?st, have e're supprest. Thy trueth, my talk; thy saving grace, my song: Thy bounties rich, my not conceling tong Hath loud proclaim'd: thy iustice, mercies deer, Assemblies great from faithful teacher hear. THEN, Lord, ô then thy kyndnes not withhold: (Thy trueth my stay:) in merci still infold Distressed soule; whose eys lift up on high, Thee, only thee their comfort can descry. Thrung numberles of ev?ls me wretch embrace: My sins and pains so grasp my frighted face; That failing hart their vieu can not endure: Who thick as hair, ten thousand griefs procure. PLEAZE Lord at length my thralled life to free: Relieve the soule, who succour sole from thee Awaits: make speed: And blushing shame confound All those, whose hate me seeks with mortal wound On earth to lay: yea, put to shameful flight, Them in my ill who place their deer delight; Who laugh my tears, take pleasure in my pain. Ah, dire decay their shames reward remain. BVT comfort sweet, and sacred ioy refill Them all, whose mynds, conformd to he?venli will, Thy mercies seek, saluation thyn dezire: High sp?rit them ay t'extol thy name inspire. NOW I a poor, throwne-doun, afflicted wight; Yet hope on God, protectour of my right: And knowe on me my Lord wil one day think. Ah, cease delay; least hart in sorroes sink. Psalm 42. [As chased Hart, with drouth enraged first] As chased Hart, with drouth enraged first, Then ioid with hope, tow?rd watri streams dooth bray: So Lord, my soule, my panting soule dooth thirst, At lifes high spring hir restles love to stay. AH life of lifes! when shall that ioying sight Of presence thyn reioice my ioyles ey? Whom now salt teares are food to day and night, “While chasing foes, Where's now thy God? stil cry. SWEET-sour revieu my hart through eys distils, How earst high ioys midst marching troop I broacht: And sacred House, whom beaute?us presence fils, With songs and praise in festiv?st guise approacht. WHY then, ô why, my sad deiected mynd, Should troubled thoughts thee restles now torment? Ah thankful wait: stil gracious Lord shalt fynd, In bands of woes release who al-times sent. YET Lord my soule behold stil dampt with grief: While Iordans reeds, while Hermons rocs she hants; While Iuri mounts affoord their poor relief: Remembrance thyn where melting hart redants. SEE, gulf of woes, nue gulf stil duely cals: Thy thunders roar; thy fires com streaming doun: And raging storm, from cloudi spouts which fals, With shouring fluds my pining soule dooth droun. YET gracious Lord stil succ?ring hand dooth reach. His face serene returned ioy shal bring: And gladsom day shal thankful eu?ning teach, With praiseful hymn th'alglorious name to sing. MENE while to God thy chased life betake; And doleful tune exiled wretch renue: My God, my strength; why doost thou me forsake? Why moorning soule dooth murdrous foe pursue? O THOW who sole sustein'st my wear?ed life, My wear?ed life, whom pow?r of right bereves; Yet iudge that cry, mongst braiding foes so rife, “Where's now thy God? My bones it swoord-like cleves. BVT why, ô why, my sad deiected mynd, Should troubled thoughts thee restles still torment? Com grateful hope. My gracious God, I fynd, In throng of woes still swift relief hath sent. Psalm 44. [Our pleazed ears, renoumed Lord, haue heard] Our pleazed ears, renoumed Lord, haue heard The ioious tongs of reverend elders tell; What acts of thyn their state of old had reard; Did cursed seed from chozen soil expell. Thy powrful hand, them rach'd vp, ours did plant: Made them nor wo, nor blessing ours to want. NOT mortal arm, extermind Giants race; Nor swoord terrene, dezired land possesd. Thy arm divine, thy right hand, lightsom face, In favour deer, from heav?n their armies blesd. Thou self same God, my King doost still remain: Command great King thy Iacobs strength again. SOLE thou command; revived strength our foes With horn should push, with feet shal trample doun. Not swoord, not bowe; hopes failing: thou disclose That aid, which foes in hates owne shame did droun. Thy loveli name much ioy did then confess: Much ioy same name in praise shal ay express. THUS once we liv?d: but now in life we dy; Cast off, debas?d; no more our armies head: Harts grief to speak; vile foes us force to fly; And preying troops in dust our glories tread. Thus scatt?red lo midst Hethen lands we live: Where food to foes flock loved once doost give. AH once belov?d! now sold, and not for gain. Thy wealth had yet our thralled lifes encreasd, Less grief had been: but scorn we now remain To neighbours round; whose hate our shames appeasd. Derided heard hast made a proverb growe; Which scoffing Heth?n with wagging heads outcrowe. WEAK comforts fade: strong woes stil fresh renue. My grief within, without my shame torments. Confusions, ah, confusions round accrue: And foul disgrace stil lothed face prezents. Reproaching voice, blasphemous mouth, and ire Of hostile eys, dire anguish still enfire. ALL this on us is com: yet have not wee Forgot thee Lord, or false thy leaug prophan?d. Nor harts repining writhe their loves from thee: Nor feet decline from sacred ways asham?d. Yea though us ru?nd in Dragons wasts doost place: And shade of death make weari lifes embrace. IF blessed name, unblest we have forgot; Disloial hands if stretcht, in strangers guise, To Gods, no Gods: and should our Lord it not Search out, whose ey harts secretst thoughts espys? Ah love of thee lo tyrants hate procures: For thee we dy; as knife fat sheep endures. AH daily slain! At length yet look; arize; Why sleeps our Lord? awake; and not bereve Thyn of thy face; nor pressures their despize, Whose soules to dust, dead brests to ground doo cleve. Stand up, great Lord; and for thy mercies sake, Oh servants thyn to thy redemption take. Psalm 45. [A noble act, of Kings dezir?d;] A noble act, of Kings dezir?d; Makes gladsom hart, with high conceipts inspir?d, Boil o're; and tong streams loveli sound; Which ech?ing pen through world shal ay rebound. Of peerles King my song I frame: And to that King, give, consecrate, the same. NOT mortal beauti decks thy face; Ne humane sounds those princeli lips engrace: That hieu divine, those heav?nli woords, Nor race of man, nor bliss of earth affoords. Sure heav?ns, fair wight, thee God hath blest: So blest, in bliss eternal shalt thou rest. THEN on; but first gird swoord to thigh, Thow p?isant Prince; advance with glori high; Ride stately foorth, in comli sight: Stil prosper, still prevail, brave Lord, in fight. So woord of trueth through world disspred; Give laws; fierce mynds in love to iustice wed: With iustice myldnes still reside; And striking arm, let hart of merci guid. BUT foes, whom goodnes none can win, Shal lightning hand with terrours dire begin To fright; then shafts, as thundred darts, Sharp shafts shal pierce their blunt unpliant harts. Thus to our King shal Nations bend: And arm victorious wide his rule extend. THY throne, ô God, for ev?r endures: Thy scepter, right through all thy state procures: Thow iustice lov?st; hat?st lawles ways: Therfore dooth God, thy God, thy glori raize Yond all thy troop; whose faithful love, Thee serves, by thee partakes same grace above. BUT thow bove all, with sacred oil, With oils of ioy, (that earths unpleazing toil Alay,) imbu?d; drawst odour sweet: Mir, alö?, cassia, in thy garments meet. Thus doost from ivor?e rooms proceed; Whose pleasures deer stil ioying thoughts refeed. Strait bevi fair prezents sweet vieu; Kings daughters chief, and lead the noble crue: Bove all the Queen; whom loveli bride Thou ioious setst on right hand by thy side. With gold hir brests, with gold hir head Embellisht, best rich Ophir which had bred. FAIR daughter, now a while attend To sage advise; thou happi ear shalt lend: Thy contries rites, thy peoples guise, Yea fathers house forget: fix sole thyn eys On him, who then that beaut?ous sight Shal deerly love, possess with pure delight. He now thy Lord: with pleazing grace Bow, fair, to him: so love sweet love embrace. LO neighbour Tyre, great Queen of seas, With curious gift ey finest strives to pleaze: With home-bred purple, far-fet gold, Wil studious seek thy fav?ring grace to hold. Yea nobles rich, with prezents great, Shal pleazd aspect of count?nance thyn entreat. NOW vieu this Princess, branch of Kings: See noble birth what gen?rose presence brings: All gorge?us, all with grace performd; While wealth hath art, and art hath wealth adornd. Yet beaut?ous robes fair face exceeds: But fairest mynd within chief glori breeds. THUS happi King, thy spouse to thee, Dezired spouse is led: and Virgin shee, With virgin troop, hir sociates deer, Attended, all to pleazed eys appear. With signs, with sounds of ioy they com; Where roial palace yields them grateful room. AND thow, great King, in fathers place Shalt children raize, end?ed with fathers grace: Whom zelous iustice to maintain, Shalt Princes high through all thy Lands ordain. AND I thy name shal make renoumd, While heav?n leads time, where ev?r fair earth hir ground Extends; yea whil?st bothe worlds endure, My verse thy praise from peoples shall alure. Psalm 49. [Ye sons of men, where-ev?r o're earths great globe disperst] Ye sons of men, where-ev?r o're earths great globe disperst; Both ye of noble race, and ye, whom fathers unrehearst In menenes have obscur?d; ye rich, and poor, attend: My mouth shal wisdom stream; which hart from muzings deep dooth send. My thoughts on sentence grave, on parable profound Defixt, at length my matter dark to harp shal cleerly sound. WHY should unpleazing fears my sadded mynd torment, When evil days approach, sweet years of pleasure when are spent; When sin with death at heels my wasting life pursues? See mighti man, whose ey his wealth with glory?ng trust revieus: No one e're brother deer from thralling death redeems; Can God the ransom pay: who price too high of soules esteems For mortal pow?r to reach: that cease may vain attempt, Mans life in line stil on to draw, from iaws of grave exempt. HE seeth great sages dy; ev?n so the brutish fool: And leve their wealth th'untimeli thirst of thankles heirs to cool. In inward thoughts then count, their houses yet secure; Their stateli seats shal undevourd through ages all endure; And lands shal bere their names. But man in honour plac?d, Like beasts fals doun; his house, his seat, his name, from earth effac?d. LO ways of fool-wise men: which yet their worldli race, As proiects high of wisdom deep with much applause embrace. But they in grave doo ly, like sheep in narr?ed holds: Where death, as wolf, devoured flesh in gnawing panch infolds. There dead, they dy. And when worlds morning fair renues, Their yelling crys shal iudging Saints with lordli doom refuze. From grave then hell shal seaze, and seaz'd their shapes consume. When God, my soule, mee, shall from bothe to him redeemd resume. THEN feare not, grieve not thow, when godles person thrives; His house when glori?us mounts. For not when death of life deprives, He all shal hence transport; ne glori train to grave: Though foolish mouth oft cursed soule in life fair blessings gave: And though men praize thy mynd stil fol?ing worlds delight. He hence to fathers race shal pack, ay shut from heav?nli light O man, great woork of price! of wisdom if bereft, If beast-like lives, like beast he dys, in dark destruction left. Psalm 50. [The mighti God, our Lord, from heav?ns first glorious voice hath sent] The mighti God, our Lord, from heav?ns first glorious voice hath sent, To call earths whole from rizing sun to sun declynd extent. And then from Si?n, (a complete world of beauties all refin'd,) By oracle, by sacred woord, more cleer to his hath shin'd. To iudgement rests our God proceed. In iudgements he dooth com, To teach, reproove; afflict, raize up: then then com?th final doom. Before the Iudge a purging fire corruption shall devour: And hid?ous tempest round about from gloomi clouds shal shour. BUT now with his peculiar folk to sweet debate he fals: And heav?ns fair eys, and earths rich womb, as conscious witnes cals. “Assemble me my chozen race, tak?n up from world forlorn: “Who law; who sacred leaug with mee through sacrifice have sworn. (O righteous Iudge! thy iustice bright the heav?ns great host proclaims: Thow fountain whence all iustice flowes, thy self more iust remains.) “HEAR, ô my people; I wil speak: thou Isr?el; for with thee I will contest: Thou know?st me God, yea thy true God to bee. That sacrifices rare to mee thy scanti hands have brought, And sacred fire on altar oft in vain burnt-hosts hath sought; Nor charge I thee: nor bull from stall, or goats from fold, wil take. Who world of wealth enioys, think'st hee penurious stores should rake? NOT so: for midst the spatious woods what beast untam'd dooth breed, What cattle sparst through thousand mounts on budding shrubs doo feed, What bird the hils, what savage fierce the desert plains dooth ply; Are all myn owne; and in my vieu; at will, serve; liue, and dy. If hunger frail (unwoorthi thought) could me assail, would I Who world and worlds rich store possess, to thee for food apply? Or when thy sacrifice thow kilst, canst thow so fondly think, Base flesh of buls that I should eat, or goats foul bloud should drink? NAY: if thyn humble thankful hart with sacrifice dezire The pow?r divine to pleaze, and give what God dooth most require: Pure sacrifice of praises bring; the sacred tribute due From creature blest to King of bliss: and of thy vows be true. Then in thy troubled state, toward heav?n thy soule perplexed raize: Crave help of mee: thy suit I'le hear: thou me eftsoon shalt praize. BUT unto th'impious, thus saith God: How dar'st thou, wretch, presume To teach my Law; my gracious leaug in graceles lips t'assume? Thy life for thereunto to frame, through hate thou standst agast: And woord divine, thy speach promotes, thy facts behynd thee cast. A thief thy greedi ey hath seen; thy hand with him conspires: Adultrous crue; with them leud hart combines in foul desires. Malicious mouth addict'st to rail: sly tong to forge deceipt: And envious lips owne mothers son to closely slander wait. THUS slave to passions vyld thou liv?st: and I have silent been: Whence, yet more impious, like thy selfe ev?n mee thou didst esteem. But I, not like to thee, at length thy iust reproof have sent: And ougli sins to fearful eys wil all aray prezent. Consider this, ô ye who God, and Gods pure law neglect: Least unrepenting harts I rend; when none can them protect. Who incense sweet of thankful praise sends up, me right adores: And right?ous life who leads, from fall to bliss my grace restores. Psalm 51. [My sinful soule, arraind of twofold gilt] My sinful soule, arraind of twofold gilt; Of Spouse-bed wrongd, of bloud ah fouly spilt; With saddest grief in tears imbrynd repents: And wailed crimes at mercies feet prezents. O sourse of grace, whence seas of mercies flowe, Release my gilt; and love returning shewe. MY gilt releasd, then clenze my soule from stain; From stain, which sin behynd stil makes remain, And nue sin breeds. But since my pensiue sight, Sin, gilt, and stain, stil wound, by day, by night; With sour remorse since them I, Lord, deplore; Ah cure them, Lord, and right?ous grace restore. NO mortal law dooth me transgressour make: Thy law divine, whose iustice he?vens dooth shake; Thee supreme Iudge, sole thee, my sin offends; Whose piercing vieu to secretst thoughts extends. Ah ev?l I, Lord, in thy pure eys have doon: So iust reproof, so iudgement right is com. WHAT shal I plead, of sin defiled mass; From sin who com, through sin to death must pass? From mould deformd lo form I first receiv'd: And mother frail in sin warm life conceiv'd. But thow in soules thyn owne true form dezir?st: And wisdom deep it to restore inspir?st. AND thus I stood: but now orethrowne by sin, Deformd, defyld; ah Lord, let grace begin Recure to woork: with spring, with hysop thyn; So scour this soule, more white then snowe to shyn: And comfort, Lord; ô ioy now make me hear: That bruz?d bones returning strength may cheer. REMOOVE my sins from thy offended ey: And cancel all my falts. Hear once my cry: Clean hart crëate; right sp?rit in mee renue: Then wav?ring mynd with he?venli stay endue. Ah cast not off griev'd breaker of thy law: Nor HOLI SPIR?T soules sov?rain life withdraw. Restore the ioy of thy sweet saving grace: And sins bond pow?r with thy free sp?rit displace. THEN erring soules my thankful zele shal burn Thy ways to teach: who glad to thee shal turn. And then my song, (but bloud keep, Lord, away, My saving Lord,) thy iustice shal display. Sole thou my lips once open, Lord, again: And ioiful mouth shal sacred praise proclaim. IF sacrifice thy pow?r divine might please, If offrings burnt thy burning wrath appeaze; What would I spare? but nought in he?ven obtains Beasts life, in man while beastlike mynd remains. Mans owne griev'd sp?rit, is Gods best sacrifice: His sighs, his tears, doost ne're, iust Lord, despize. THEN ô return: ô bless stil Sion deer: Ierusalems stil lingring wals uprear. With cleered harts then wee, in legal rites, Iust sacrifice, wherein great God delights, Shal bring: yong buls at altars side shal bleed: And offrings burnt th'undying flames refeed. Psalm 67. [Be gracious Lord: Let cleerly shine] Be gracious Lord: Let cleerly shine The beauties of thy blisful face: That earth may see thy ways divine, And nations all thy saving grace. Let people bless thy sacred name: Let people all renoum the same. ALL wo exil'd, let ioy return: For thow who right doost still protect, Shalt iudge them who for iustice moorn; And erring nations here direct. Let people praize thy glorious name: Let people all adore the same. THEN shall the earth, as fild with love, Hir gifts in great abundance poure: And God, our God, from heav?n above His choisest blessings richly shoure. God shall vs bless: and vtmost lands Shal all submit them to his hands. Psalm 68. [Let pleaze our God to ?rize, that en?mies his disband] Let pleaze our God to ?rize, that en?mies his disband, And hating foes in hated flight be chas'd by mighti hand. As smoke strong wynds doo drive; as fire dooth wax consume, So shalt thou sweep them from thy face; so wast them all to fume. Then shall the right?ous mynds, whose hopes on God depend, Reioice in him; and thankful shouts to heav?ns high coort upsend. SING, ô sing praise to God; advance that glorious name, Th'Eternal, Selfbe?ing, Lord; who mounts on heav?ns high arched frame. Prepare, make plain his way; who o're alpestrious place Coms marching tow?rd his seat elect: triumph before his face. Not hee, neglecting man, despizing mortal care, In sacred throne resides; not so: but chyld of parents bare, Him Father fynds; him wido, Iudge: he pris?ner, frees; To sole, an house; to rebel race, dry parched soil decrees. WHEN Captain thow, ô God, thy troops from Phara?s thrall Victorious ledst; through deserts wyld when march'dst before them all: The mooving sea stood still; th'unmooving earth it shak?d; The heav?ns at presence thyn dropt sweat; fore thee mount Sinai quak?d. All Isra?ls God did dread. Thow then with bount?ous rain, Didst chozen land enrich, didst strength exhaust repair again. HERE thow a seat for thyn, thy poor despized bands, A seat prepar?dst; where ioious dwell, and rule should neighbour lands. Thus did thy goodnes shine: thy goodnes, which their foes With conqu?rous arm subduing round, large matter did discloze For dam?sels at return with ioying note to sound; Kings armies fly, they fly; and spoils wee home-left soules haue found. FOR though in servile state, like scullions, mongst the pots, With soot ye long have lain begrymd: yet now your happi?r lots As dove shal make you shine; who with hir lustring wings, Now silv?ri hieu, now golden light, to ey delighted brings. For when th'Almighti Lord those Kinglets strawd on ground; Like snowe on Salmon black, dark woes bright ioy so then had cround. NOW Sion draws myn eys: whom Bashans peer account: Nor Bashans soil, nor stateli clifts, fair Sions praise surmount. For why should worldli hils, the earths huge tow?rs so rize And vant their might; why hill of God with surli brows despize? Here Gods dezired rest; thus ay shal it excell: Celesti?l squadrons here attend; here Sinais glories dwell. Twise thousands ten, and more, brave host of heav?nli Knights, Gods will observe; receiv'd, perform: hee midst, their love requites. BUT thow, victorious Lord, ascended art on high, In triumph great; lead'st thraldom thrald: and there, great gest of sky, Hast gifts of grace receiv'd; mongst men which doost divide; Yea race rebellious so doost win with thyn to thyn abide. Be blest then Lord, our God. With saving graces hee Us daily loads. For God's the God that brings salvation free, Hath issu?ng ways from death: but en?mies head shal smite, Yea hairi scalp of him in sin who still shal take delight. BUT to his people saith; I them wil bring again, From tyrants yoke, from strangers coasts, from land, and Sea, amain: As once from Ægypts rod, from deapth of sea, and pride Of Bashans Gi?nt, I them reduc?d made ancient fields divide. That thow thy foot maist dip, thy dog his tong embrue, In smoking streams of fomi bloud, which en?mies brests out-spue. And now Gods march proceeds; thy march, ô God my King, Who in thy Sanctu?ri resid?st; there blessings man doost bring. A sight of ioy: Before, the singers hold their way; Them instruments ensue; in midst yong maids on timbrels play. All cry with ioy, Bless God; Praize in assembli high, Ye Isr?els stream, the Lord. Here first smal Beniamin stands nigh, Late Prince; here Iudahs Lords, their troops; and here appear Naphthali?n Lords from far; with Lords who Zeb?lons honour rear. AND now since gracious Lord commanded hath our strength; Maintain from sacred house, plac?d o're Ierusalem at length, What thow great God for us, what hast for fathers wrought: So from subiected Kings to thee shal prezents due be brought. RATE doun the reed-shafts beast; the buls and heards so bold; With peoples calf-like Lords, who vain in silver plates have rold. So woork thy peoples peace, secur?d from Hethen spite: O thow who scattrest them on war who set their fierce delight. And then Ægypti?n peers, then Æthiopi?n lands, Soon humbly shall with gifts to thee stretch foorth their suppli?nt hands. YE kings, and kingdoms all, o're earths fair face disspred; With songs and sounds of ioy adore, your God, and supreme head, Whence all your pow?rs derive. Hee then on th'heav?ns rides, On heav?ns of heav?ns of old, and rocks with thundring voice divides. Ascribe all might to God, whose glorious beauti shines, On Isr?els head; whose peerles strength, the matchles sky designs. O God, thyn Israels strength! what venerable fear Thy sanctuaries strike? Be blest. Our soules to thee we rear. Psalm 69. [Help Lord, and save, a poor distressed wight] Help Lord, and save, a poor distressed wight; Not tost with waves, (though seas against me fight, And beat my soule;) but sinking in the mud, Where bottom none; and where the surging flud With furious stream beres doun and whelms my life. Ah save me, Lord, and end my bootles strife. I strive, though spent; I cry, when voice is quail?d; For God I look, when eys have looking fail?d. TH'iniurious sp?rits, my not-deserved foes, Who hunt my life; with numbers me encloze That pass myn hair; and rizing still in strength, Press on, til mee (ô wrong!) they force at length What nev?r I took, as taken, to restore. Ah thee my falts, my folies ly before. BUT not for mee, Eternal Lord of hosts, Great Israels God, let those, whose humble boasts Of thee have been, confounded rest in mynd; Nor shame in face, when him forlorn they fynd, Who thee with them in patient hope hath sought. For thy sake, Lord, to this I lo am brought: For thee, I scorns, and sour rebuke endure. May service thyn, great Lord, such shame procure? WHAT should I speak of frends unfrendli face? My brethren deer, same mothers home-born race, A stranger mee, an alien mere esteem. And why? The zele, of which I worthi deem, Thy sacred hests, thy House, and glorious name; (Which godles crues, stil grieving mee, prophane;) Hath e?ten me up: Reproaches throwne at thee From mouths infernal, light have all on mee. IN grief, I wept; and fasting, fed on care; My ioyles lims, rough sacweb cloth?d on bare: My weed, they proverb; mocks, on fasting pour; And laugh the tears, which vexed hart dooth shour. In iudgement place, gainst mee the ancients spake. Yea balads base, vyld drunkards of me make. AND I, my Lord, to thee now praying bend; In needfulst time: Let ô my crys ascend, And time accepted fynd. O God, my trust; If right thou seest; and if my plaints be iust; In plent?ous merci, and for thy saving trueth, Send ô that help, which life in death renu?th. OH free me, Lord, from sinking in this mire, This groundles mire; and from their fierce desire, Whose hate my life persu?th. Draw from these waves Th' orewhelmed soule, thy hand who drouning craves, And prays; Forbid this gulf my life t' inglut; Devouring pit on me hir mouth to shut. HEAR Lord, with speed; and tender ey reflect, Thou Goodnes pure: thy servants not neglect, In case extreme who mercies hand implore. O spring of grace, I mercies those adore. Then, Lord, be neer: yea for my insulting foes, To free my soule once heav?nli aid discloze. AH see, and iudge: thou know?st my sad reproach; Fore thee my foes, my shames who shameles broach, Stand all in sight. Their wrongs have worn my hart. Full charg?d with grief; I lookt if yet som part My frends would bere; no frend condoling found: If comfort speak; but none least comfort sound. For strengthning meat, yea poiz?ning gall they sent: And vin?ger tart, my thirst to quench prezent. THERFORE iust Lord, their owne them home repay: Their pleazing boord, where ioys before them play, Let turn a snare, to catch them in their woords: And (that which foli as lot to fools affoords,) Their wishes, hurt; good fortunes, bee their bane: Mynds sight obscure; their loins rough valure lame. AND as in furi, man laith lode of blowes: So let revenge, which from thyn anger flowes, Ad stripe to stripe; and seaze with raging ire Their hated heads which mischief sole dezire. Void stand their castles: dweller none be found To grace the tents where graceles facts abound. FOR thow whom, Lord, with hand severe hast smit, They fierce pursue; and inhumanely sit, With grievous woords t' encrease thy woundeds pain. Let sin, so sin; so plague, to plague enchain: Thy righte?usnes that still they wretched miss; Nor way e're fynd that leads to heav?nli bliss. Devowd to death, from book of life efface: Ne write their names, where iust mens names have place. NOW I stil poor, sole rich in griefs remain. Help, saving Lord, and raize me once again: That raiz'd, thy grace my song may thankful praize; And blisful name to heav?ns fair arches raize. This sacrifice more pleazing God shal bee, Then cleft-hoov'd steer at Altars horns to see. THE myld of mynd, great comfort hence shal take; This sight shal ioy them. O let harts awake, To seek the Lord; and so your harts shal live. Nor wynds, nor seas, can from his anchor drive. For ey of care who tow?rd mans wants reflects, His pris?ners crys sure nev?r at need neglects. THEN heav?ns, and earth, then seas, and all your gests Which spatiate there, conform to supreme hests, Ay laud our King: who Sion fair wil save; And Iudahs touns repair. There shall they have A seat, and lasting state. Thus God shal bless His folks true seed, who love tow?rd him address. Psalm 79. [The Heth?n, ô God, who fear not, no nor knowe] The Heth?n, ô God, who fear not, no nor knowe Thy glorious name; into thy land are com: And in thyn House, whence blessings pure did flowe, With hands impure polluting facts haue doon. DEFYLD thy sacred seat; thy rites prof?ned; Thy treasures robd; thy Citti set on fire. Ierusalem, earths ioy which earst was nam?d, Throwne doun on heaps, sits now in lothed mire. THY servants slain for loial love to thee: Their bodies dead he?vens fouls cast out to feed: And flesh of Saints, whose faith thyn eys did see, To earths wyld beasts ingluvious throats decreed. THEIR bloud, as torrent, streams about the wals Of sad Ierusalem: no burri?r found. Opprobrious scorn, us grievous lot befals; And laughings proud in neighbours mouths abound. HOW long, ô Lord? shal ever flame thyn ire? Can no distress once moove to pitti take? Thy iealous wrath, and shal it rage, like fire Which water none, no tears, may e're asslake? AH turn it first, gainst those, who nor invoke Thy name, great Lord; nor knowe, or seeke thy face: Gainst Hethen kingdoms; who with mortal stroke Thy Iacob wound; lay wast his resting place. REDUCE not, Lord, to thyn offended eys, Those falts forepast, which, still unthankful, wee, And fathers our, have doon: let grace arize, Our soules from gilt of sorroed sins to free. AND thou arize; and with thy mercies deer, Prevent our instant deaths. Ah, case extreme Denys delay. Help, source of goodnes meer; And save vs thow, whence safeties all doo stream. RESPECT, great Lord, the glori of thy name; Which wee revere; our enimies proud despize, Insulting Heth?n: to say they doo not shame, “Where's now the God on whom their hope relys? BVT let our God make noble, in our sight, To Hethen eys, his high revenging hand; That giltles bloud, pourd out, and not in fight, Of servants thyn, may full revenged stand. AND let the sighs and moornings of thy Saints, Who grone in chains, to thee access obtain: And mighti arm, excited by their plaints, Them rescue who now to death consignd remain. THUS neighbours scorns, wherewith they thee reproach, Sev?nfold to them in bosom, Lord, restore. We then thy folk, and flock, thyn acts shal broach; With thanks and praise will ev?r our God adore. Psalm 73. [Yet surely God benign to Isra?l stands] Yet surely God benign to Isra?l stands; To pure in hart. But I was sore declynd. Griev'd vieu of fools, of wicked prospering hands, Had welnigh sapt my weak unwari mynd. FROM bands of death, by sicnes, force, or snare, They free pass on: live lusti; puft with ioy: With humane toils and cares untroubled are: Yea publick plagues them least and last annoy. THIS makes with pride, their out-stretcht necks, like chein; With violence fierce, as robe, they lims attire. Their plent?ous fare red strouting eys proclaim: While heaping wealth surmounts ev?n harts desire. FROM poiz?ning filth their lothsom talk they change Oppressions proud with lofti stile to sound. Their tongs through earth in wronging men doo range: And hellish mouths gainst heav?n dead curse upbound. THESE sights Gods folk to grievous thoughts reduce: (To whom full cups of mingled bitter geer “Are wringd:) Dooth Heav?n, say they, knowe earths abuse? “Or mortals coorse dooth pow?r immortal steer? “But vieu these men; the heav?nli leaug who shun, “Earths shame, mans wrong: see how in calmest peace, “Devoid of storm, here lengthned race they run: “They health stil keep; stil wealth and pow?r encrease. IN vain then I, ah all in vain have sought, With careful thoughts my hart from stain to cleer: In vain my hands, in woorthi?st actions wrought, Themselves to God in purenes washt doo rear. For as stern sires their sons of sweet of life With sour reproofs, and bitter strokes bereve: With mee so griefs, so blowes are daily rife; Ne ioy sharp fits of mornli chastment leve. BUT ô my God, should I these thoughts embrace; Should mazed soule illusions these entrance: Lo, impious wrong, gainst thee, gainst happi?st race Of children thyn, I faithles should advance. PERPLEXED I, then sought this dout t'untwine: But ah in vain; stil tangled stood my wit. At length I pierc?d the Sanctu?ri divine: There learnd mens ends: then then the knot unknit. SURE wicked men aloft on slipp?ri brows Thy hand dooth place, with greater noise to fall. Doun headlong rush they: vain fly faithles vows. How soon, how sore, thy frights their ioys appall? MUCH like as dream unguided fanci fils With shapes untrue; which wakened all are gone: So when thou stirst, their image Lord it spils; Their pompous shews despiz'd from world are flowne. THUS whil?st my soule on bitter grief did bite; While thorni thoughts my fuming hart did wound: As brutified, my mynd had lost hir light; Yea groveling beast I in thyn eys was found. YET still was thyn: and thyn shal ay abide: By right hand tak?n thou staidst me with thy grace: Thy counseil mee in beaut?ous way shal guid: And lastly safe in happi?st glori place. FOR whom can heav?n, whom earth save thee display, In whom or ioy, or rest, my soule might fynd? O spring of life! when flesh, when hart decay, Tow?r, partage thow eternal standst assignd. LO Creatures strang?d, to thee, Creatour great, Alegiance due who faithles soules deny, Shal fail; who thee of spouzed love defeat, Adultring harts, in ireful vengeance dy. THAT good for mee, estrang?d from pleazing sin, With God sole spring of pure delights to dwell; There fixt to rest. My trust then ioy in him: His gracious woorks my thankful hart foorth-tell. Psalm 82. [The Sov?rain Lord, whence iustice all derives] The Sov?rain Lord, whence iustice all derives; Who mesur?d pow?r to earthli Lords divides; His Senate of his presence nev?r deprives: Th'immortal Iudge mongst mortal Gods resides. Sith iudgement's his; how dare ye iustice wynd, To scurge the good, while miscre?nts favour fynd? THE poor ye should, the weak, the orphane free, From wicked strength stil bending to oppress: But ignorance, (ah, not for high degree,) And vainest thoughts your darkned mynds possess. Thus ruled coorse of all things turn'd awry, Makes trembling earth to heav?ns for iustice cry. I STYL'D you Gods, who Gods earth-ruling place As glorious sons of supreme Lord doo hold: But dy ye shal, as men of menest race, As foregone Princes now resolv'd to mold. And rize, great Lord; thy iudging right resume O're nations all, whom tyrants wrongs consume. Psalm 84. [The fair aspect of Tabernacles thyn] The fair aspect of Tabernacles thyn, Great Lord of hosts, how loveli to absent ey It self prezents? my longing soule dooth pine, And pining faint, til shee thy Coorts descry. Nor earth, nor heav?n; sole thow lifes glorious spring, To hart, to flesh, reviving ioy doost bring. AH, absent I: when yet poor sparro may, When swalo wyld, hir house, hir nestlet cling Neer Altars thyn, and there hir yonglings lay: Yet absent I, from thee, my God, and King. Twise blest be they, who in thy house reside: Thy praise with them, their loves with thee abide, AND blessed hee, far off who, cheerd in thee, On causies thinks which to thy mountain guide. Dry vales they pass: sweet springs by art yet see: And gracious rain fore-drouth of pools dooth hide. From wasting strength, by strength they walk ren?ed; To Sion fair, where God of Gods is vie?ed. THEN Lord of hosts, then Iacobs God, our shield; Ah, ey the face, with favours thyn endu?d, With sacred oil perfuz?d. Hear Lord, and yield Those longed Coorts; where one sole day accr?ed, Whole thousand stains. With mee Gods doors excell The stateli?st tents, with impious pride that swell. OUR sun, our shield; whence life, whence light derives; Whence sure defence, whence strength proud foes to quell: He right?ous mynds of nothing good deprives; They here in grace, in glori above shal dwell. That earth, that heav?n, Lord God of hosts may cry; Thrise blest the man, whose hopes on thee rely. Psalm 90. [In pilgrim life, our rest; in thrald estate, our stay] In pilgrim life, our rest; in thrald estate, our stay; From age to age thou Lord hast been, and sav?d us from decay. Thy self, ere birth to hils, to earth ere form didst give, Ere world hadst fram?d; from ay to ay alglorious God doost live. But man thy creature fall?n, thy iustice dooth pursue “To dust: and saith, Ye Adams sons, return whence first ye grew. WHEN thousand years we liv?d, those thousand in thy sight Not more appeard then one day past, then watch in shortest night. Yet soon encreasing sin those years much shorter makes; While vengeance due defiled world to drouning flud betakes. Since when, our dreamlike life, as weakest herb, soon dys; Which morn makes flour, hote noon bids fade, sad eev?n mowes doun and drys. AH men ublest! thy wrath our weari?d life consumes: Thy terrours great our soules affright: so sore thyn anger fumes. Our sins, our foul revolts, before thy face hast set: And secretst falts to cleerest light of eys displeaz?d are fet. What have our toils atchieu'd? through anger thyn, our day Black night devours: our fruitles years as thought fly vain away. MANS shortned life, as now, sole sev?nti years dooth bide: Great strength to fourescore may attain. Of these ev?n flour, and pride, What is't but toil, and grief; but vain pursuits, and sin? Which spent, we hence to dusti home away to post begin. Oh who dooth duely waigh the pow?r of heav?nli ire? As terrors thyn, so is thy wrath; ô thow consuming fire! Then teach us so our days, our wasting years to count; That wisdom true our thoughts tow?rd thee our endles end may mount. Return, ô Lord: (how long?) at length appeazd, forgive Thy folk: let favour shour in time, that dying harts may live. AND comfort, cheer us, Lord: as chastiz'd long by thee Much ev?l our woful eys have seen; like ioy so cauze us see. This ioy with life shal last. Then let thy woork growe cleer Tow?rd servants thyn: on children their thy glori make appear. And let Gods pleazed face us with his beauties bless: And form our woorks; ô thow, our woorks to happi?st end address. Psalm 92. [A good, a gracious act it is] A good, a gracious act it is, To praize the Lord, to celebrate his bliss: Thy name, ô Highest, to renoum, With hymns, which earth with heav?ns high honour croun. Thy bount?ous grace, let springing day; Let silent night, thy faithful trueth display. Let ten-stringd lute, with viole sweet, Melodious harp in sacred consort meet. Since ioy to me thy woork dooth bring; Thy woorks, great Lord, my thankful ioy shal sing. O LORD, thy woorks how glorious great; How deep thy thoughts, thoughts shalo to defeat? The floting brain of brutish man, Not once observes, not once it fathom can; That when as grass the wicked growe; When sinners proud, doo sprout, doo bud, and blowe; In flouring state they shall be mowne; And all for ay to sad destruction throwne. While thow, ô Lord, most high, most iust, Ay happi liv?st, whole worlds sole endles trust. FOR lo, thyn impious foes, ô Lord, Thyn impious foes, of heav?ns and earth abhord, From earth and heav?ns lo chas?d away, In darknes dire their damned heads shal lay. My strength but thow, like stateli horn Of Un?corn stout, with dread and beauti born, Wilt long advance: Oil fresh ren?ed On me shal stream with gladnes sweet imb?ed. And ey shal see, ioid ear shal hear, Chance wicked foes, what gilti harts did fear. THE iust mene while, as fenced palm, Shal flourish fair, (no storms shal him uncalm:) As cedar tall, mount Libans praize, His lofti top tow?rd heav?ns high valt shal raize. Men planted midst Gods sacred place, In sacred coorts shal spring: yea through his grace, In age extreme stil fruit shal give; Stil iuiceful, still with greeni boughs shal live. To shew that God, my strength, and light, Ay iust persists, ay pure from all unright. Psalm 94. [Avenger great; who mans presumptu?us sin] Avenger great; who mans presumptu?us sin, Earths righte?us Iudge, with plagues to chastize doost not lin: At length shine out, ô spring of purest light; Rize up; pay home the proud in worlds apparent sight. How long, great Lord, how long shal godles sect, Shal wicked crue triumph, who heav?nli laws neglect? Shal tyrants fierce, impunely fome their shames; And grievous wrongs contrive; then vant their hateful names? THY servants, Lord, with iron teeth they grynd; Th'elected race oppress: no plea to barb?rous mynd, Nor widoes eys, nor orphans palms can make, Nor humbled strangers knees, their murd?ring rage to slake. That doon, thus say; Can this to God be told? Or Iacobs Lord wil hee from heav?n our facts behold? O blynded soules! gainst God ye cloze your eys: Look up: why natures light doo brutish mynds despize? CAN soverain cause, whence all perfections flowe, Himself not knowe; on man yet knoweing pow?rs bestowe? Who plants the ear; shall hee unhearing bee? Who ey with sight endues; himself (ye fools) not see? Round world who rules; who nations all dooth rein; To check, to scurge leud lifes, may careles hee remain? Yeas God dooth see; th'eternal light dooth knowe: Yea know?th in hart of man how vain conceipts doo growe. O Blest that man, whom thow doost Lord correct; And by correcting teach tow?rd sacred laws respect. Midst days of ev?l in rest he safe abides; For wicked wretch dead pit while vengeance due provides. For sure our Lord his folk wil not forsake: Wil not peculiar flock t'abandon e're betake. For iudgement shall to iustice pure return: And draw all upright harts, which now for iustice moorn. AH who for mee dare gainst malfactors rize; What courage take my part? If thow thy gracious eys, If succ?ring hand, deer Lord, didst not extend; My life tow?rd death, my soule tow?rd silent place did bend. But when I cry'd; My foot, ah Lord, dooth shake: Thy pity?ng grace did mee to staid protection take. In swarms of cares, midst sad perplexed thought, Yet comforts thyn delight in troubled soule have wrought. MAY vi?lent throne, from thee, Lord, pow?rs derive, That lusts for laws ordein, and griefs for ease contrive? By troops they range, the right?ous soule to kill: Yea iudgement seats abuze, ungilti bloud to spill. But God my tow?r, my high retreit hath been; My Lord, my rock assur?d in worlds fair vieu was seen. He hee their wrongs, their spite shal them restore: Yea God our Lord their pride hew doun for evermore. Psalm 100. [With raized voice, and cheerful grace] With raized voice, and cheerful grace, Approach, ye Nations all, our king: On bended knees prezent his face With hymn of bliss, which Angels sing. For knowe, Hee formd vs, (God, not wee,) His flock, his folk, yea sons to bee. O THANKFUL enter then his gate; His coorts high praises make exclame: Resound his acts, and glorious state; And prostrate bless his sacred name. Whose goodnes, great; and favour, sure; Whose trueth, like heav?ns unchang'd dooth dure. Psalm 101. [Of Iudgements, Lord, to thee I'le sing] Of Iudgements, Lord, to thee I'le sing; Where Iustice Merci shall embrace. Such thoughts shal righte?us use make spring, Tow?rd mee gainst pleaz?st to bend thy face. MYN house an upright hart shal guid; Which vice shal check, which goodnes grace. No pleazing sin shal train aside Those eys, which thee before them place. WHO thee forsake, from mee I'le shake; Their woorks and them I'le ay detest. Nor perverse imp there root shal take, Where evil all shal be supprest. THAT sly deceipt, the sland?rous tong, Which iust men heedles may beguile; That secret seed of neighbours wrong, Severe reproof shal strait exile. THOSE hauti looks of swelling mynd, Which Thee neglect, and equals scorn; That self-love, hatred myn shal fynd; I'le soon pul doun their lofti horn. WHAT woorthi person through the Land Myn ey can vieu, what faithful wight: He graced in my Coort shal stand; His upright service my delight. BUT false, dissembling, flatt?ring mates, With lying tricks that plot their owne; No harbour get within my gates; Their tricks and They shal out be throwne. MY kingdom then I will begin From foul corrupti?ns clean to pare: To hunt the wicked to their gin, Shal be my daili earli?st care. SO shall Gods Citie brightly shine; So shall his people flourish ay: When damned crues exiled pine; And lawles folk are swept away. Psalm 103. [Pure light of soule, thou high-bred mynd] Pure light of soule, thou high-bred mynd, Deriv'd from God, and God to praize assignd; Adore thy Lord; his beauties bless; And glorious acts in praiseful hymns express. Bless still my soule with all thy pow?rs, That sacred name whence bliss so richly shours. No tract of time ô e're efface, From thankful hart sweet vieu of bount?ous grace. OF GRACE, which all thy sins remits; And all thy griefs, sins pay, with cures befits: Thy life from grave which dooth redeem; Redeemd dooth round with deer compassions steem: With healthi?st food thy mouth which fils; That egle-like youths strength through age distils. HE supreme iudge, whence iustice springs, To wrongd on earth from heav?n iust iudgement brings. He ways divine to Moses showne, By Moses made to Isr?els ofspring knowne. Same Israels race with ioy hath seen Those Acts, to foes which terrour dire have been. TH'algracious Lord with pitti is fraught; (How slowe to wrath, how soon to merci wrought?) Nor strive, nor chide wil alwaies hee; Ne let his ire, though iust, unending bee. Not like our falts, his strokes were found: Sin wrath provok'd; grace merci made abound. FOR look how high earth heav?n transcends; How far from East to West huge space extends: So great his grace tow?rd servants prooves; So far our sins deer Lord from soules remooves. As father tendreth feeble son: With sonli fear like kyndnes his is won. FOR well he know?th our brittle state: Remembring whom of clay he did crëate. As earth-sprung grass, as flour of field; So flouring man; to earth whose days must yield: When wynd sweeps o're, fair flour is gone; The place earst brave, inglorious stands alone. BUT ay benign, still God the same, Tow?rd them persists, who fear, who love his name: Yea right?ous trueth, to fathers sworn, With race observes of childrens children born: Sole that his cov?nant they attend; And loial harts tow?rd sacred mandates bend. THE Lord in heav?n his throne hath plac?d: With kingli rule, heav?ns, earth, and seas, embrac?d. Ye Angels then, heav?ns happi gests, Excelling strengths, obsequious to his hests; Ay bless the Lord, adore our King; Whose woord ye serve, whose will to men ye bring. YEA all his hosts, through world arrang?d, Industrious troops, servants of faith unchang?d, Bless ay his name; whose glorious will, Your sev?red ways, united woorks, fulfill. In sum his creatures great and small, Where ev?r disperst throughout his empire all; Bless, bless our Lord: bless thankful mynd, Thy blessed Lord, whom thow so good doost fynd. Psalm 104. [Magn?nimous, mighti, glorious Lord; my soule shal sing thy praise] Magn?nimous, mighti, glorious Lord; my soule shal sing thy praise: Whose Greatnes greatest heav?ns surmounts; whose Beauti dims their rays. Thee, King, imperi?l Glories croun; thee Mai?sties dread attire: Magn?ficence thyn whole world refils; high Bliss transcends desire. Great Lord, my God; eternal Life; Perfection; purest Light; Unbounded Goodnes; rob?st thy self with beams of glorious sight. CREATOUR high, first cause of all: Hee bee?ng to all things gave: Hee Heav?ns like courtains fair disspreds, with stars bespangled brave: Grand Lights as lamps illuster all. Those lighter Waters, see, As chambers how midst air he rears: thick Clouds his charriots bee: On wings of Wynds he swiftly walks: Oft wynds as Angels makes; And service dire to flying flames of high-bred Fire betakes. THE Earth midst air hath rarely hangd: yet hangd by rule so sure, As nev?r to moove, while light in sun, while stars in skys endure. It first with cristal robe had hel?d: all Sea, no land was seen; Deep flouds surrounding highest mounts: no seat for man had been. But strait at thy rebuke they fly; them thundring voice dooth chase, Up hill, doun vale, by shortest coorse, to their commanded place: Vast deep their foming streams receives. Here bounds their surges fynd, Proud waves to break; here laws from thee their roring rage to bynd. THUS land from sea ay free remains. Then Springs to land dooth send, Tween hils which run; fair vales enrich; encreasd to seas descend. Hence moisture sweet draw flouri medes: hence drink myld cattle take: Here beasts of field doo quench their thirst; wyld ass dry heat asslake. By these wingd birds, sweet gests of air, on native arbours mount; And pleazing notes mongst greeni leafs in cooling shade recount. THE mountains from his raized lofts with sweet concocted Rain He watreth so, that rich in fruits all parts of earth remain. Pure fatnes drops: strait pregnant earth in various robe arraid, Sees Grass for beasts, sees Herbs for man, as tribute duely paid. Man thus sustaind, assisted thus; by art deriv?d from high, By gift of thyn, the earths rich womb t'improove dooth soon apply. Here Corn, here Vines, there Olives plants; with bread his hart to cheer; With wine his drooping sp?rits to glad; with oil his face to cleer. THE Trees of God like blessing draw: the Cedars; which his hand, Not care of man, on Liban plants; there ages long doo stand. Here Birds their curious nests doo build: the Storks midst lofti boughs Of stateli Fir with parted love themselves half strangers houze. Nought useles stands: to Mountains steep, the Shamois make retreit; The craggi Rocks, weak Connies shield; thick Woods, give Deer receipt. LOOK up eftsoons; see changing Moon made changing seaz?ns to shew: The Sun his certain race dooth run; his nightli settings knowe. Strait darknes black bids light withdraw: withdrawn, the forest mooves: Wyld beasts in woods that lurk, creep foorth; seek food what each behooves. Yong Lions rage and roar for prey; from God their meat require: And fed, at suns return to dens their cooching lims retire. Then foorth go?th Man, their Lord by thee: hee at his daili toil, Deserving so, til eev?ning bides; and earth in earth dooth moil. O LORD, how man?fold are thy woorks? high wisdom all did frame: Thy goods, which earth, which sea doo store, no tong, no thought can name. The Sea, a place of vast extent, where cralling things abound; Where swimming beasts both great and small past number all are found: Here walk the Ships; which worlds whole wealth dispersd by trade unite: Stands wondring Whale, there made to play; himself more wondrous sight. THESE creatures all thy care attend, meet food in seaz?n to have. Thow scattring, they it spars'd colect; larg'd hand, gives all they craue. If gracious face thou once avert; they troubled all doo moorn: Their sp?rit withdraw; they breath gasp out, and to their dust return. If sp?rit of life thy grace send foorth, which world with be?ing endues; Thow recrëatst his wasted store; so face of earth renues. BE then, ô glori'ay be to God: Thow praiz'd from thankful voice, Receive due tribute, gracious Lord: So in thy woorks reioice. Repair at length worlds great defects; ô thow whose ires consume: Whose stern aspect shakes trembling earth; whose touch makes mountains fume. I whil?st my life, while be?ing dooth last, shal still thy praises sing: Sweet ioy shal thoughts of thee imbue; ô thow my blisful King. Let sinners foul, who earth defile, defil?d have made abhord; Consum?d from earth pay vengeance due. Soule myn, praize thow the Lord. Allelu-ia. Psalm 107. [Ye woorthi mynds, in whom Gods gifts excell] Ye woorthi mynds, in whom Gods gifts excell; Whose persons walk on earth, high thoughts in heav?ns doo dwell; Renoum our Lord, ring foorth his glorious name; Whose goodnes no time fails, sweet mercies still the same. O BLAZE his acts, ye now at rest that stand, From hostile pow?r redeemd, redeemd from strangers land: Ye late dispersd, now gathered by his grace; From East, from West, from North, yea from great Oce?ns place. In deserts wyld, through uncouth invious ways, All tired, all forlorn, they wandred nights and days, With fainting sp?rits, through thirst and hunger pin'd; And no relief, no steps tow?rd cultiv?d place could fynd. IN need extreme when lo to God they cry: He gracious hears their mone: and help from heav?n makes fly. So strength renues; so straying feet directs To peopled wals; and safe from perils all protects. O thankful then to God his grace confess: His merv?ilous woork to men with ioious tongs express. Who thirsting soule with waters sweet refreshd; The empti fild; and pace tow?rd longed home addresd. In darknes sad, in shade of grisli death, With ir?n and anguish bound, who sighd their servile breath; (Il-ruled mynds, that this and more deserv'd, That Highests woord despysd, from Gods advise that swarv'd:) When hart-burst clean, they grov?ling rold in pain; Ne hope of better saw, nor place for worse remain: IN need extreme to God their suit they bent; Who pity?ng rueful plight, from heav?n sweet comfort sent. He darknes dire, grim shade of death dispels: He cords from hands, from feet he fetters burst repels. O thankful then to God his grace confess: His wondrous act to men with ioious tongs express. Who brazen gates made all to fragments flee: Brake bars of ir?n, strong Lord, and pris?ners did enfree. UNGOVERND fools, transported by their lust From vertu?us ways to vice; when God severely iust, Their wicked ioys afflicts, such sicnes sends, That soule abhorring meat, at deaths pale door attends: IN hour extreme to God then lo they cry; Who gracious hears their grones, and ease from heav?n bids hy. Doun com?th his woord, the per?shing soule to save; And hasting life retracts from neer approached grave. O thankful then to God his grace confess: His mercies great to men with ioious tongs express. And clensd in hart, iust sacrifice of praise Let grateful hands yield vp; renoum him all your days. TO Seas in ships, who (Arts chief woork) descend, Adventrous harts, by trade penurious state to mend; Or spatious lakes who pass; what wondrous sight, Strange woorks of God in deep, their staring looks affright? Lo strait his woord tempestu?us wynd dooth rear; And roughest frouns on seas late smiling face appear: Anon tow?rd heav?ns on back of arched wave They mount; dismount in trise tow?rd hels unloveli cave. As drunk they reel; then melting harts gin fail; Nought toil, nought careful coorse of Masters skil avail. IN case extreme when lo to God they cry: Who gracious hears griev'd voice, and help from heav?n bids hy. Strait wynds repose; smooth hieu calmd seas regain: Harts ioy; woorks cheer; til safe they long longd hav?n attain. Then thankful ô to God his grace confess: His merveils great to men with ioious tongs express. And let Gods Church, let faithful people hear Vowd praise: in senat grave his mercies rare endeer. HEE bubling springs chokes up with thirsti sand: Yea rivers rich, accursd, dry desert makes to stand. And fertile soil, in plague of owners sin, To saltnes damns; whence fruit nor skil nor toil can win. AGAIN his grace dry desert stores with pools: Sends springs, and bare burnt earth with fruitful moisture cools. There hungri soules their citti sets to place: Who sowe their grains; plant vines; years sweet return embrace. Abounding food then blest with restful peace; To numbers huge themselves, their flocks and heards encrease. BUT harts puft up, soon spurning heav?nli law, (Ah fools,) in chains of sin enchained tortures draw. Oppression foul, sad days, unthriving care; Their ioyles mynds abase; their branching numbers bare. He vyld contempt on woorthles Nobles pours; And wayles wasts makes walk, chas?d out from lordli tow?rs. Yet godli poor, raizd up from pressing need, As tree makes branch, as flock his branched race to breed. THESE things the iust with reverend ioy shal see: And wicked mynds and mouths appald and stopt shal bee. Who then is wise, these sights to hart to lay? Gods goodnes they shal learn; Gods praises they display. Psalm 110. [The Lord said to my Lord; Thow at my right-hand sit] The Lord said to my Lord; Thow at my right-hand sit; While foes their necks I to thy feet as foot-stool make submit. From Sion, seat of Grace, the Lord thy scepters might Through world shal send: midst all thy foes bear rule thou Prince of light. What day thy warli ranks shal high exploit begin; The people prest, with cheerful strife, to serve thee shal com in. Anon, as prime of morn with silv?ri perls of dew Al-spreds the world; like troops thy youth in sacred house shal shew. THE Lord, who will not change, hath sworn fair Prince to thee; A Priest thou art, Melch?sedek like, and ay that Priest shal bee. This Prince, who on thy right hand, great King of heav?n, thus shines; Each earthli King in ire shal crush, that gainst his rule repines. He H?then with swoord shall iudge; fields, streets with corps shal straw; Imperi?l Head whom Nations serve, assubiect to his law. As lightning, swift shal run; in way of torrent drink: Thus glori?us head triumphant raize; while danted foes doo shrink. Psalm 111. [My hart dooth heav?nli heat enflame] Allelv-ia. My hart dooth heav?nli heat enflame, To sound high praise to glorious name: Th'alglorious Lord, midst right?ous press, In sacred senate shall I bless. Great are Gods woorks; and bless their sight Whose mynds in knowelege high delight: His gracious hand all good hath formd, All beaut?ous, all with grace adornd. Ov?r all Gods Iustice glorious raigns: Which right?ous ay, unswaid remains. HIS acts which wondring Fathers saw, So live, enrold, as guiding law; That ages all with ioy recount Those graces, thoughts which all surmount. Hee gracious Lord, with merci fraught, His race elect, from thraldom brought, In desert bare, in hungers raign, With food celesti?l did sustain. Hee, who his covenant still remynds, Where righte?us fear, true faith he fynds; To Isra?l deer his pow?r expresd, Which them of Hethens land possesd. THUS all his woorks are trueth and right; Prints of his hand, sparks of his light: His sacred precepts faithful all; And dying man to life recall: Unchanging rule; unerring guid: So Lord and Law stil same abide. For when he first redemption sent, And feet late thrald at freedom went: He law, he leaug with them ordaind, Eternal bothe from he?ven proclaimd. That man should awful thereto frame: Sith holi and dreadful lives his name, PRIME entrance unto wisdom true, Gods greatnes is to fear. O you, Sole you right understandings bless, Who tremble his mandates to transgress. Adore him then; whose praises pure, As sun, illustrous ay endure. Psalm 112. [O happi man; with humblest fears] Allelv-ia. O happi man; with humblest fears, And purest loves tow?rd God who bends: With sweet delight Gods law he hears; And heard, through actions all extends. O HAPPI man! thy ioys are true: Thy house with plente?us wealth abounds: Thy iustice yields, and reaps, hir due; Hir fruit to thee stil blest redounds. HIS ofspring, noble in their race, By noblest vertues so endure: Long hold on earth great pow?rful place: And world of blessings round alure. YEA ev?n in time of darkest wo, To him dooth cheerfull light arize: To righte?us man; who no mans fo, Stil merciful, stil merci trys. HEE helpful, bounte?us, lends, and gives; Reward from Gods sole grace expects: In choisest thoughts stil blessed lives; Which prudence rightly still directs. THERFORE he stable ay shal stand; Nor storm, nor engin, throwe him doun. Yea gracious woorks of vert?ous hand, With fame immortal shal him croun. HIS setled mynd on God relys; No troublous nues can him affright: Firm stands his hart, and fears defys; Which on his enimies pates shal light. THUS spends the iust, thus ends his hours: Dispersing hand the needi feeds: Doun glorious blessing on him shours: Reaps endles prize of ended deeds. THE wicked this shal see, and vex; Shal grynd their teeth, and pine to nought: Sad fears shal duely them perplex; Their deer desires to nothing brought. Psalm 118. [Sing, ô, sound out Gods woorthi praise] Sing, ô, sound out Gods woorthi praise, Who goodnes pure, stil grace displays. Let Isra?ls race agnize the same: And thankful now renoum his name. Great A?rons house, thou blest to bless, Same goodnes, same sweet grace confess. Yea, all who fear our glorious King, His rich, his endles merci sing. IN streit distress the Lord I sought; Who gracious, fair enlargement brought. That sith my God dooth mee assist; Sith aiders myn his aid hath blist: Nor fear I man, doo man his woorst; Nor faun on fo, with rancour burst. Much better ô in God to trust, Then ground on man, whose ground is dust: On God yea better to rely, Then Princes; lo, ev?n Princes dy. MEE nations all encloz'd, as toil; But Gods great help all put to foil: As circle, they did mee surround; But Gods great help bare all to ground. Yea ev?n as cloud of Bees they swarmd, With ireful stings against me armd: As cracling fire of thorns soon spent, By Gods great help to smoke they went. THOU sore at mee, my fo, hast thrust; My wrongful fo: but God, God iust, With succ?ring hand me staid from fall; Thy plots, thyn hopes defeated all. He, hee my strength, my verse of praise; Sole health, sole ioy for ending days. HARK: voice of ioy, triumphing sound, Fils right?ous tents, with safeti cround: Sing, God, our God, this fight hath wrought; Whose right-hand valiant acts hath sought: Advanced stands that powrful hand; And pow?rs terrene makes all disband. IT'S true, God mee did sore correct: Yet still from death my soule protect. Then live I shall; (where's death thy sting?) O God, thy woorks, thy praise to sing. NOW tow?rd th' Eternals glorious place, With rev?rence bend we ioyful pace. Ye sacred Priests, to heav?ns great King, Who vows, who prai?rs, sweet praises sing; Uncloze your gates: give praise access, At gates which praises all possess. Hence crue profane: Gods gates are pure; Sole right?ous mynds, clean thoughts endure. “O KING of Kings; who ear didst bend “To iust requests; and safeti send: “Lo prostrate here thy servant true, “Yields thanks, brings praise, great Lord thy due. “What stone th' Archbuilders did reiect; “Their fol?ers scorn; the world neglect; “Same stone now angles fronted head, “Thy peoples strength and rest hath bred. “O GRACIOUS Lord, thyn act it is; “Great act of merci, act of bliss: “Our ravisht thoughts, our wondring eys, “Thy woork makes mortal woorks despize. “This day thy grace hath made us see: “Which ay to ioy shal sacred bee. “Then still, great King, thy goodnes raign: “Stil safeti, still this ioy maintain. O BLESSED thow, whom God hath sent; And here dooth King in grace prezent. We Priests of God, Gods merci seat Who ay atend, ay God entreat Appeaz'd his people deer to bless; Wee bless you: Long Gods bliss possess. HEE th' onli God, this light hath raiz'd, This ioying light: He sole be praiz'd. To altars horns beasts festive bynd: Let sacred bloud seal faithful mynd. THOU art my God; I'le bless thy name: Our Lord; to heav?ns wee'le raize thy fame. Sing then, sound out Gods glorious praise: Who goodnes pure, stil grace displays. Psalm 119. [O blessed they; who men upright in mynd and way] Aleph. O blessed they; who men upright in mynd and way, In Gods pure law delight, his sacred will obey. Yea blessed, who embrace his woord that witnes true: And God their sov?rain good with flaming harts pursue. Such men sure sin decline; in paths divine proceed: Them careful hold: which held, have high reward decreed. O THEN, sith thow so strait thy hests to keep hast charg?d; My ways were so addresd, my feet so, Lord, enlarg?d, As free thy steps to trace: no blot shal mee distain, No shame confound; on thee while fixt myn eys remain. Right hart thy praise shal sound, for law of iustice taught: Which learnd, Ile keep: at length reduce me ô to thought. Beth. VVherewith may careles youth his falti paths amend? If heedful by thy woord he them to guid attend. Ah Lord, with hart entire I thee have truly sought: O let not straying soule with trains of vice be caught. Long I thy precious laws have treas?red in my hart, To purge out sin: Blest Lord, stil teach that sacred art. REMEMBER Lord, my lips, and not unthankful tong, How free thy woord have taught, how glad thy praise have song: How deer delight I take in way from heav?n declar?d: Vain ioys breeds world of wealth, with these true ioys compar?d. With muzing mynd I vieu, and still thy law admire: Nor sight gives end to search; nor search to sweet desire. Gimel. This gift, this favour, Lord, on servant thyn bestowe; That live I may; and live, thy saving grace to knowe, Yea sacred woord to keep. Then thow myn eys unsele; And wonders of thy law to groping mynd revele. I stranger rome on earth; my seat with thee abides: O hide not heav?nli way which to thy presence guids. DESIRE my soule consumes, stil muzing on that path: Which pride derides; dead pride, devowd to firi wrath. But thou repell their scorns. Ah zele to sacred law, From Princes seats did griev'd unprinceli censures draw. Yet still, I still thy woord in studious thoughts renue: Sole solace in my griefs, in douts adviser true. Daleth. My humbled soule to dust, prostrate on earth, dooth cleve; Remynd thy woord; and up revived servant heve. My hart, my state, and ways, to thee I did unfold: Thou heard'st with grace: then still me precepts thyn, enrold In faithful brest, direct. Discloze thy beaute?us way: And moorning soule recheerd thy merveils let display: REMOOVE by-paths of lys: thy trueth hath been my choise; Thy law my mirrour. O, make cleer thy gracious voice: And folo?r of thy woords grant through that favour high, Be nor asham'd to live, nor Lord afraid to dy. Yea when my narro?d hart shal noble grace enlarge; Base lets despiz'd, I'le run what race thy mandates charge. He. Great Guid of men, my feet address in righte?us way: My feet; by thee addrest, which ne're from thee shal stray. Recleer my dimmed mynd, sweet beauti of thy laws To vieu: which vieud, from hart like love abundant draws. Thus hart deiect erect, thy rizing paths to clime; Thy woord, my high delight, in raized thoughts to shrine. BUT from unwoorthi gain; from vain aspects, which fire Unwari brests; disturn myn eys and frail desire. And quick?n me in thy way. Ah to thy servant true, Devoted to thy fear, thy roial woord renue. So feard reproach discharge: with iudgements iust recheer The fainting soule which longs thy statutes to endeer. Vav. Let then thy mercies deer, salv?tion, favours high, Foretold by gracious woord, at length great Lord draw nigh. That those who mee reproach depending thus on thee; Confounded quite, their scorns my glori high may see. Mene while let woord so true tow?rd him not wholy sleep, Who trusts in thy decree, stil still thy law wil keep. AND keeping thus thy law, abroad I'le boldly walk: And of thy woord fore kings undanted freely talk. O King of kings, thou thow my love and sole delight: Thy hests my ioy; on them I still defix my sight; Tow?rd them my hands I'le raize, to act what they require; Who sole possess my thoughts, command my chief desire. Zaiin. Then myndful of thy speach, thou Lord stil true and iust, Shine foorth; sith in that woord hast causd thy servant trust. Sole this to grieved mynd sweet comfort still derives; This pressed state supports; this dulled sprites revives. The proud both it and mee with scorns profane deride: Nor pride, nor scorns profane, from thee can mee divide. FOR iudgements thyn of old my muzing thoughts revieu: Which mee secure: but ah stil horror then renue, When ends of lawles men my pity?ng mynd foresees. But I, in pilgrim life, stil singing thy decrees; In silent night, with ioy revolving Lord thy name; Thy statutes keep; which kept, these ioys in mee enframe. Cheth. My portion, Lord, art thow: my thankful mynd, resolv'd Thy woords to keep, hir cares on thee hath all devolv'd. And hart with fervent suit thy gracious face hath sought: Let then those mercies shine which gracious woord hath taught. For strait my earthli ways, with vieu unpartial eyd, Delay cut off, I glad to heav?nli coorse applyd. THIS worldlings hate procures; whose troops make me their prey. Nor hate of world, nor wrongs, me from thy paths can fray. Thou witness, Night; whose midst with thanks me rize dooth hear Gods iudgements iust to bless: thou Day; which God who fear, His laws who love, my deer companions all doost see. Thow then, whose grace earth fils, thow, Lord, my leader bee. Tet. I must confess, my Lord, that graciously with mee, As was thy woord, hast dealt: ô grant, from passions free, With sence and science right, thy servant still esteem. For ev?n afflictions all I now thy favours deem: Which straying soule reduc?d; who since beleeves thy law, Thow good, and good who doost; still me to goodnes draw. THE proud with conscious gilt have lys gainst mee deviz?d: I careful kept thy woord; that kept, their lys despiz?d. Their harts hath tallo' obdur?d: thy hests are my delight. And since thy chastning hand my humbled soule aright In wisdoms school hath fram?d; more deer thy laws I hold, Then streams of silver fine, then hils of purest gold. Iod. Thy hands me made, and formd: reform thy servant, Lord; And understanding give, which sin may make abhor'd. Thy iudgements all are iust: I knowe, in faithful trueth, And for my good, thy love, thus scurged hath my youth. But now let promis'd grace, with comfort shine: that they Who fear thee, know?ing my case, thy praise may glad display. YEA let thy mercies shour, and weari?d soule refresh: That with?ring hart reviv?d may life from thee confess. Let pride asham?d remain to seek my causeles bane: Whose harmles thoughts thy law their sole delight doo frame. Let zelers of thy hests to mee themselves adioin: And clenze my hart; that shames sad scandal none eloin. Caph. My long erected soule, stil looking for thy grace, Thy woord stil trusting, now bends doun hir fainting face. Consumed are my sp?rits; consum?d my waiting eys: Like bottle parch'd with smoke, my self now self despize. Yet still beleeve thy woord; thy precepts still apply. How mani rest my days? when draw thy comforts nigh? AND when shal I my Lord see swoord of iustice draw, Gainst proud persuing foes; who pits, (not so thy law,) For righte?us steps have delv?d? Ah hate the most uniust! Thow then whose hests are trueth, my life neer trod to dust, If still thy law I love, if mercies thyn attend, In merci keep; which kept, I'le in thy service spend. Lamed. Thy woord for ev?r, great Lord, in heav?ns enthron?d remains: Thy woord, which all did make, and all things made sustains. Thy trueths through age to age with stedfast coorse proceed. Stands peized earth, ne mooves, by thee so Lord decreed. Thus lo, as thow ordain?dst, they all this day persist; Thy servants all, to act what e're thy iudgements list. MY woes had mee consum?d, had solace in thy law Not cheerd that hart, which nought can e're from thence withdraw. For thyn I am: ô thyn preserve from wicked swoord, Which dogs my life; who live in study?ng Lord thy woord, In tracing Lord thy ways. O ways of widening ioys! When else perfections all see fretting time destroys. Mem. VVhat, Lord, what heat my soule with sacred love inspires Of law divine? what pow?r thus rapts my strong desires? All day to quicned cares, to pozed thoughts at night, It self prezents: stil shines high mynds admired light. A light, whose rays infuz?d, more sci?nt me make and sage; Then teachers, books; wit, foes; or gray experience, age. O LAW, my thoughts delight! desire those mandates pure, Lawgiver great, to pleaze, dooth wari feet inure, All sinful ways to shun, thy woords high paths to hold; Makes iudgements thyn observe, which sacred rols have told. Yea sweetest iuice my tast not so with sweetnes feeds: As woord, which wisdom true, vyld falshoods hate, imbreeds. Nvn. Thy woord, a lamp divine, fair star that leads the day, To paths obscure dooth shine; and guids to heav?nli way. And I by sacred vow, a vow in heav?ns enrold, Stand bound, and rest resolv'd that woords iust rules to hold. Afflictions mee extreme bere doun: let promis'd grace, Revive me: ô then, I pray, poor lips frank gifts embrace. MY soule see still in hand stands prest away to fly; Such snares my life beset: yet still thy hests I ey; Can not thy Law forget. O teach me Lord thy ways: Thy woord since all my state, sole ioy my hart to raize; And thow my sov?rain good; since soule entire I bend Thy will to doo, in this lifes breth extreme to spend. Samech. Thy Law I deerly love; mans vain conceipts despize; Thow refuge myn, and shield; whose woord my waiting eys Stil holds in hope. Avant, avant then crue profane; Gods mandates iust I'le keep: sole thow my hope from shame, (The hope thy speach hath raiz'd,) with life persu?d, defend. Sav?d lifes so whole delight I'le in thy statutes spend. AND lo transgressours proud, whose fraud shal self deceive, Thyn earths inutil load, of grace whom doost bereave; As basest mire doun trod, as dross with purging fire Consum?d, shal sole remain sad marks of heav?nli ire. Therfore thy woord I love: in love, yet quake with fear, When iudgements thyn I vieu; yea hair dire horrours rear. Haiin. I right and iust have wrought; thy law hath been my guid. Abandon then me not t'uniust oppressing pride. But intercede with help, my sureti and witnes true: And failing eys with strength of right?ous speach renue. Thy servant, I: deer Lord, thy servant not forsake: Give sci?nce, thy hests me teach; and to thy favour take. THUS I thy will shal knowe. But time for thee, great Lord, For thee to woork: whose laws, of lawles mynds abhord, Quite now they would displace. I, Lord, so much the more Bove finest gold them prize; thee fountain iust adore; Their vertues high admire, in all things alwaies right: And falshoods ways perverse all spurn with iust despite. Pe. So merv?ilous shines thy woord, in pow?r, in wisdom high, In goodnes; that my soule with wingd desire dooth fly, And pant, it to attain. Lo then thy sacred light I folo Lord with ioy: since understanding bright Discloz?d ev?n simple mynds it gives. Thow mee with grace Aspect, as those who thee in highth of loves doe place. AND first my steps so guid in path of heav?nli woord, That sins dark pow?r decay. Then mee with Iustice swoord From mans oppression free: free man thy ways I'le trace: O thow thy servant teach. And with thy gracious face Cheer up my grieved eys: whence streaming tears doo thrill, To see unthankful man neglect thy saving will. Tzade. High Iudge of worlds, from whom pure Iustice doun dooth flowe; Whose law, worlds perfect rule; whose woord, hid trueth makes knowe; And iudgements all are right: thou these with charge severe Hast man enioind to keep: that mee griev'd zele dooth wear, To see my foes forget thy speach proclaim'd above; Thy speach, which pure as heav?ns, drawth up thy servants love. I SMALL, and am despiz?d: thy precepts yet apply: Which mirrour true of thee; which rule deriv?d from high Of iustice firmly pitcht, of never changing right; In toils, in grasping griefs, stil yield me sweet delight. Sole thow my dazeling mynd, (pure lights eternal spring,) Illuminate: which light shalt life eternal bring. Koph. Prostrate with ardent hart, with tear-distilling eys, I call, I cry: ô thow who iust complaints despize Nor doost, nor canst, thou hear; and save him, who thy hests, And witnest will wil keep: if undefil?d requests Morns dawning oft; if oft my waking thoughts prevent Nights watches, tow?rd thy woord, their hope, in muzing bent. LO, fainting voice to thee my still unfainting hart Sends up: send doun thy strength: and Prince of grace who art, Revive me as is thy wont. See, neer tow?rd me they draw, Who mischief dire pursue; far they from (Lord) thy law. But thou art neer: whose hests for never-changing trueth Long since thy teaching woord assur?d my learning youth. Resch. At length let pity?ng ey respect afflicted wight. And thow, mans hart who seest, art conscious of my right, And pressing fo observ?st; plead thow my cause; and free Soule cheered through thy woord, addicted whole to thee. Thy mercies Lord are wide: yet far from godles crue; Who seek not thee, nor way to bliss that leads pursue. BUT mee thy doom revive: whom now persuing foes, Not faithles to thy woord, with swarming troops encloze. O grief! myn ey to see men break thy right?ous law; Despize celesti?l bliss: in lines of love which draw Thy servants soule: see Lord; and quick?n them with thy grace, Who iust, eternal woord, trueths sum, with ioy embrace Schin. VVith causeles hate, ô Lord, and not unwronging swoord, Have Princes mee persu?d: yet aw of heav?nli woord My hart restraind from sin. O woord, whose ioys more draw, My ly-detesting mynd, and mynd that loves thy law, Then ioy which Princes gifts, or foes rich spoils can bring! Sev?n times yea daily I thy righte?us iudgements sing. IN throng of worldli waves, which sweet of life devour, Their mynds stil calm abide, no scandal there hath pow?r, Where love of thee directs. Lo then thy saving grace My hoping eys attend: sole thow his love embrace, Whose pure affection seeks thy pleasure to fulfill. I fain not, Lord: my ways, yea hart, thou vieust at will. Thav. Then let at length approach, ô Lord, my fainting cry; Vouchsafe my suit access: sole understanding I, And riddance from my foes, (which promized hast,) require. Thus taught thy will, and free; tow?rd thee my quick desire Shal spring; my lips thy praise, glad tong thy woord shal sound, Where trueth, where wisdom pure, where statutes iust abound. LET then thy hand now help; if not with cold pursuit Salvation thyn I seek. Vouchsafe me Lord this fruit Of making thee my hope, thy law my choise delight; O let my soule yet live, preserv'd from tyrants might; And it shal praize thy name. Seek then thy straying sheep, Who wandring now, as lost, yet strives thy law to keep. Psalm 122. [My longing hart deer ioy assaid] My longing hart deer ioy assaid, As gracious sound strook grateful ear: Religious mynds! Each neighbour praid, In Gods fair house let's all appear. Ierusalem, our peaceful feet Now frequent in thy gates shal meet. IERVSALEM, the earths delight; A Citie, three compact in one: To thee the Tribes, in legal rite, Gods chozen Tribes ascend alone. Sole here shines out heav?ns glorious King: Here Isra?l all his praises ring. RELIGION Iustice dooth embrace; Who doubled bliss through land derive: For iudgement thrones here hold their place; And wronged right with aid revive. Iudicial thrones, the Kingdoms pow?r; Of Davids croun most glorious flour. O THEN Ierusalem respect; Hir peace with vows to heav?n commend. Ierusalem! who thee affect, Them ioy, them bliss, stil prest attend. O peace ay in thy tow?rs reside: In houses plenti ay abide. I FOR my frends, my brethrens sake, Whom race, whom rites, in love combine; Shal alwaies pray; Earths peace partake; And heav?ns rich light upon thee shine. For Gods fair house, my ioy, I'le sure Stil studious, still thy good procure. Psalm 128. [O blessed they, whose humble harts] O blessed they, whose humble harts True fear of pow?r divine endues: Religious soule, that ne're departs From way which blisful life renues. O BLESSED man! thy ioys abound: Thyn house thy cheerful hands shal rear: And labours iust, with blessing cround, Shal feeding fruit stil plente?us bear. THY wife, a vine on wall disspred, In fruitful love hast ioious met: Thy children sweet, in vertu bred, Fair olive plants, thy boord beset. LO thus Gods fear thus grac?d shal bee: From Sion deer thee God shal bless: And quiet home shal plenti see; And life contented long possess. THAT all thy days delighted ey Ierusalems great weal may vieu: And wasting life it self espy In childrens children to renue. O THANKFUL then Gods love alure; Stil right?ous life with care maintain: So happi long maist thou endure; So peace with Isr?el long remain. Psalm 130. [Out from the deep, to thee ô Lord I cry] Out from the deep, to thee ô Lord I cry: From place far off; yet thow good Lord be nigh. Lord hear my voice, and with attentive ear Receive the plaints which humbled soule dooth rear. IF strictly Lord transgressions thou shalt ey; Lord who shal stand? in sad despair we dy. But Iustice thyn stil mercies thoughts displays: That Greatnes, fear; and Goodnes love may raize. WITH pati?nce then on God my soule attend: (His woord, my trust:) Hee'le give thee ioyful end. As morning rays rere sentinal desires: So so, and more, tow?rd thee my soule aspires. And pati?nt ô await him Isr?el deer: His great redemption now wil soon appear. He merci is: His merci from their thrall, Yea from their sins, shal ransom Isr?el all. Psalm 137. [By Babel streams, exil'd from Contri deer] By Babel streams, exil'd from Contri deer, As doun we sate, a sad dismaied crue; Ah, Sions wrongs to pensive mynds appear, Sions, whom now our eys no more should vieu. Wee wept: and trees that saw our tears abound, Hang'd up those harps which wont our ioys resound. THEN scornful Lords, who Sions towrs had fir'd, Gods Temple raz'd, and vs to thraldom seaz'd; In anguish, mirth; in tears, a song requir'd; And with som Hymn of Sion must be pleaz'd. Should hymns divine to ears profane be song? Can Sions Psalms to Babels coasts belong? O SION fair! and Gods elected seat, (Where envi earst, but piti now may ground;) Ierusalem! If thee I e're forget, If in my ioys thow chiefest be not found: Let parched tong to with?ring palat growe; And skilful hand no more his science knowe. BUT thow, ô Lord, whose right-esteeming ey Ierusalems last traveils did behold; Let Edoms malice never cov?red ly, Which cruel mouths did strangely then unfold. Their cursed cry record in heav?nli ear; Raze, raze hir clean; till loweëst stone appear. AND Babel, thow, who Sions bane hast wrought; Ne sacred Temple spar'dst with fire to burn; Shalt see thy self to same destructi?n brought: And blessed they, who thee the like return. Yea blessed they, who take thy cursed seed, With dasht-out brains the crying stones to feed. Psalm 139. [Eternal Light; gainst whose al-seeing ey] Eternal Light; gainst whose al-seeing ey, Mans thoughts, his cares, and ways, doo all transparent ly: Lo here my soule; which thow with piercing vieu, Hast searched, and doost knowe; so liv?st hir witnes true. Great Iudge of harts; who secret pleights unfold'st; Who past with future things all present ay behold'st: Thow know?st my coorse, when doun I sit, when rize; Yea thoughts unborn far off thy foresight strange descrys. BY day my walks, at night my silent rest Thow doost env?ron, with skill to all my paths addrest. Observ?st my tong: no woord unwaigh'd doost leve: Yea, lips ere woords produce, or thoughts hid speach conceve. And grasp'st me so with thy al-guiding hand, Behynd, before, as prest at pleasure thyn to stand. Science profound; of strange transcending law! That man nor it can sound, nor self from it withdraw. FOR whether go, how should I bend my flight, Thy spirit Lord to balk, or cloud me from thy sight? If sore tow?rd heav?ns; in heav?n thy throne resides: If flag longst earth; lo earth thy footstool lowe abides: If stoop to hell, and iaws which gastly gape; Nor hell thy vieu, nor feends thy thundring stroke escape. If Eastern steeds, and Mornings crimson wings I timely mount, which round to utmost Oc?an brings; Thou Easts great coorse, and Morns fair wings doost guid, Nor utmost Oc?ans-gulfs from thyn aspect can hide. PERHAPS might say, yet darknes mee may hele; Shee with hir sable robe from searchingst ey concele. And canst once think, weak shade which Sun dispels, Should Light of lights eclipse, who thousand Suns excels? Fond, base conceipt! To thee, ô Light divine, Both dark and bright are like; grim night as day dooth shine. For iust and right, that thou Creatour high, Who all hast fram?d, thy frame shouldst naked all descry: And who my hart, my reins in womb didst form; With lims support; attire with skin, with sence adorn; Shouldst hart and thoughts, shouldst sence and ways possess. Stupendious woork! which ay great Architect shal bless. A little world; yet world of wonders great: Which well my mynd conceipts, and tong of it shal treat. MY bones in weak, in place obscure my sight, In earth beneath my mynd, fairspark of heav?nli light, Thou didst produce: embroid?ring ev?rie part With woork so rare, that use with beauti strives in art. And dout we yet if thow thy woork didst knowe? Or can our tongs forbear thy glorious praise to shewe? Yea, tender mass, while formles it remaind, And day by day nue shape through vertu thyn aggaind: Thyn ey saw all, enrold in book divine; Where all thy woorks to com, as present, cleerly shine. BE blest, great Lord: thy wisdoms beaut?ous ways How precious, deerly sweet, to thee my soule doo raize? In skill, mans wit; in count, they pass the sands: That still my wakened mynd, with thee first present stands; Admiring all thy woorks. O righteous King; At length then pleaze thy world to first estate to bring. Extermin race defil'd. Ye men of bloud, Whose base flagitious mynds despize th'eternal Good; Who grace his foes; of him profanely prate; Avant from mee; your selfs, and damned ways I hate. AH sov?rain Iudge, to thee my soule appeals, My witnes true; whose sp?rit mans secretst thoughts reveals: That love of thee, gainst them griev'd hatred breeds, Whose ven?mous hate gainst thee breaks out in hostile deeds. Thy foes are myn: with them I leaug forsake: And firm in perfect hate to vengeance iust betake. THEN thow, my Lord, to whom I stand, or fall; Who right?ous mynds approov'st, yet none canst perfect call: Revieu my hart, explore my thoughts again; And waigh what grieving coorse dooth in my life remain. Refine my soule: purge out corrupted vse: And safe through worldli waves to thy sweet rest conduce. Psalm 141. [To thee, ô Lord, to thee my humbled mynd] To thee, ô Lord, to thee my humbled mynd, Hir humblest voice prezents: ô let me favour fynd: And hast my God; let ear benign be lent, To pitious cry, to suit, from grieffull hart upsent. O let my prai?r, perfum?d with heav?nli grace, So stand, and sweetly smoke, before thy pleazed face; As incense pure midst holi?st altars fire; And hands let stretcht, to thee like eev?nings gift aspire. MY speach so, Lord, my thoughts, and deeds compoze, That nothing thee offend. A watch assign, to cloze My mouth on woords unmeet; the gate to heed, That two-leafd gate of lips, whence life and death proceed. Retire my hart from poiz?ned baits of sin: Renforce my mynd, that no provokements mee may win, Untrue to thee, with men that mischief breed To ioin; their coorse to run; on dainties their to feed. LET iust mans zele me yea severely beat; I kyndnes shall it deem: let his religious heat Reproove my life; as precious balm, my head, Not break, it shall perfume: And thankful hart imbred, When change of times with sorroes him may press, For comfort his to thee shal fervent suit address. NOW these mens Iudges, who with chozen bands My harmles life pursue; withdrawn, were left in hands Of horrent rock: where terrour none from mee, But pleazing woords they heard, from dout their soules to free. BUT not they so requite. When wee again Into their claws are light, nought cruel they refrain. But as in woods, when stateli trees to ground Are hew?d; the chips, and stics ly sparst on all sides round: So bones of men, devoured by their ire, At graves sad mouth ly strawd, and earths first womb dezire. NOW then, ô Lord, myn eys since look to thee; In thee I trust alone; and succour none else see; My God, my Lord; ô not my suit reiect; Nor bare my soule of shield that sole can it protect. My chased life from snaring net withdraw; Which men who love their lusts, not love thy sacred law, For it have pitcht: destroy deceiptful grin, Which men compact of fraud have set t'entrap me in. AND thow iust Iudge, whose ey our mortal ways With right esteem beholds; and snare with snare repays; Let impious heads owne tangling nets infold: While I with myn break through, of thee who safeti hold. Psalm 145. [Great Lord, my God, and glorious King] Great Lord, my God, and glorious King; My soule triumphs thy bliss to sing: While heav?ns shal last, with grateful praise Bove heav?n of heav?ns thy name I'le raize. When Sun with Eastern rays up-springs; And when doun West his flames he brings; In toils of day, at nightli rest, Ay praiz'd, and ay shalt thow be blest. THY Greatnes first my mynd admires; (Whose right like praises great requires;) Thy boundles be?ing: which gulf to thought, In bounds each creature fit hath wrought. Thy woorks each age with praise recounts; And pow?r, which pu?sance all surmounts: And I, with wondrous acts, that light Of glorious state will glad indite. They prow?s and valures strange confess: I beaut?ous Mai?sti would express. THY Goodnes next prezents sweet vieu: Where bounties rich stil gifts renue. Glad hands receive: and thankful tongs Shal sound what praise such grace belongs. Here who thy Iustice can forget; Where hymns, where ioys are sweetly met: Thy iustice fair, with merci cround; Of glorious bliss th'al-gracious ground? O LORD benign, of best desires, To piti ay prone, unprone to ires, Tow?rd all, thou good, thou full of grace; Thy Mercies all thy woorks embrace. THERFORE Great Sire, shal all thy woorks, In heav?n what shines, midst earth what lurks, What e're disperst through worlds great frame, Ay blaze, ay bless thy gracious name. THEY chief, who deer of thee esteemd, Live Saints on earth, from earth redeemd: Thy kingdoms glories they shal teach; Thy peerles strength they fearles preach. That pow?r magn?ficent, bliss divine, And beauties there which glorious shine, May sons of men, to all made knowne, All win to love and serve thy throne. THY Kingdom, Lord, nought Kingles leves; Nor m?sure of things, nor times receives: Domin?on boundles; ev?ri place, Each time, all things, dooth round embrace. Here reigns our Lord, our bliss to breed; Stil true of woord, stil iust of deed: Who gracious, fallen man erects; The sliding stays, the staid protects. HERE eys of all thy care attend; Thy care, due food which still dooth send: Thou plent?ous hand o're world doost spred; Whence each thing liv?ng rests largely fed. Thus all thy pleasure, Lord, partake; Thy pleasure, still to good awake: In righte?us ways thus ay doost raign; Ay kynd in all thy woorks remain. AND lastly, Lord, thou dwell?st on high; Yet still to iust requests art nigh: Thy servants suits fynd gracious ear; Their safeti shewth thy aid is neer. For impious race wilt all destroy: And all who love thee seat in ioy. Wherfore my mouth incessant praise To thee shal pour: and all my days My tong excite all humane flesh Ay ay that sacred name to bless. Psalm 146. [My soule, with ioy thy self address] Allelv-ia. My soule, with ioy thy self address, The mighti Lord, thy God to praize: My tong his sacred name shal bless; My hart tow?rd him I'le alway raize. While life dooth last, the glorious King, Yea whil?st I am, his praise I'le sing. NO Tow?rs of hopes on Princes raize. What aid can mortal man perform? Whose breath departs; and ended days From dust deriv?d to dust return. His thoughts and proiects dy withall: Your towring hopes to ground doo fall. BUT blessed they who chooze his name, Whose hopes and helps with him abide, Who heav?ns and earth and seas did frame, And world of gests which there reside. His thoughts no wav?ring can assail: His woords are deeds, and never fail. THEN thee our Lord and God we sing; Thow Iacobs God stil blessed bee: Who iustice to the wrong'd doost bring; The hungri feed, the prisoner free. Who blynd with ioious sight doost cheer; And curbed lims doost upright rear. THE iust he loves; the stranger gards; He wido shields, and orphane guids: But mischief dire iust wrath awards To wretch who right?ous way derides. The Lord eternal King shal raign; And Sions God ay so remain. Allelu-ia. FINIS.</field>
