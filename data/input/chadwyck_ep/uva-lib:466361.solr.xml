      <field name="fulltext">A Legend of Camelot. Part 1. Call Braunighrindas left her bed At cock-crow with an aching head. O miserie! âI yearn to suffer and to do,â She cried, âere sunset, something new! O miserie! To do and suffer, ere I die, I care not what. I know not why. O miserie! Some quest I crave to undertake, Or burden bear, or trouble make.â O miserie! She shook her hair about her form In waves of colour bright and warm. O miserie! It rolled and writhed, and reached the floor: A silver wedding-ring she wore. O miserie! She left her tower, and wandered down Into the High Street of the town. O miserie! Her pale feet glimmered, in and out, Like tombstones as she went about. O miserie! From right to left, and left to right; And blue veins streakt her insteps white; O miserie! And folks did ask her in the street âHow fared it with her long pale feet?â O miserie! And blinkt, as though 'twere hard to bear The red-heat of her blazing hair! O miserie! Sir Galahad and Sir Launcelot Came hand-in-hand down Camelot; O miserie! Sir Gauwaine followed close behind; A weight hung heavy on his mind. O miserie! âWho knows this damsel, burning bright,â Quoth Launcelot, âlike a northern lightâ? O miserie! Quoth Sir Gauwaine: âI know her not!â âWho quoth you did?â quoth Launcelot. O miserie! â'Tis Braunighrindas!â quoth Sir Bors. (Just then returning from the wars.) O miserie! Then quoth the pure Sir Galahad: âShe seems, methinks, but lightly clad! O miserie! The winds blow somewhat chill to-day. Moreover, what would Arthur say!â O miserie! She thrust her chin towards Galahad Full many an inch beyond her head. . . . O miserie! But when she noted Sir Gauwaine She wept, and drew it in again! O miserie! She wept: âHow beautiful am I!â He shook the poplars with a sigh. O miserie! Sir Launcelot was standing near; Him kist he thrice behind the ear. O miserie! âAh me!â sighed Launcelot where he stood, âI cannot fathom it!â . . . (who could?) O miserie! Hard by his wares a weaver wove, And weaving with a will, he throve; O miserie! Him beckoned Galahad, and said,â âGaunt Braunighrindas wants your aid . . . O miserie! Behold the wild growth from her nape! Good weaver, weave it into shape!â O miserie! The weaver straightway to his loom Did lead her, whilst the knights made room; O miserie! And wove her locks, both web and woof, And made them wind and waterproof; O miserie! Then with his shears he opened wide An arm-hole neat on either side, O miserie! And bound her with his handkerchief Right round the middle like a sheaf. O miserie! âAre you content, knight?â quoth Sir Bors To Galahad; quoth he, âOf course!â O miserie! âAh, me! those locks,â quoth Sir Gauwaine, âWill never know the comb again!â O miserie! The bold Sir Launcelot quoth he nought; So (haply) all the more he thought. O miserie! Part 2. An one-eyed Eastern past, who sold, And bought, and bartered garments old; O miserie! His yellow garb did show the thread, A triple head-dress crowned his head; O miserie! And, ever and anon, his throat, Thick-bearded, gave a solemn note; O miserie! The knights were gathered in a knot; Rapt in a trance, they heard him not; O miserie! Before them Braunighrindas stood In native growth of gown and hood; O miserie! Fresh from a cunning weaver's hand, She lookt, not gaudy, but so grand! O miserie! Not gaudy, gentles, but so neat! For chaste and knightly eyes a treat! O miserie! The Pilgrim eyed her shapely dress With curious eye to business: O miserie! Then whispered he to Launcelot, âI'll give five shekels for the lot!â O miserie! Gauwaine his battle-axe he drew . . . Once and again he clove him through! O miserie! âNo man of many words am I!â Quoth he, and wope his weapon dry. O miserie! A butcher caught the sounds and said, âThere go two cracks upon one head!â O miserie! A baker whispered in his fun: âButcher, more heads are crackt than one!â O miserie! âThe moon is up to many tricks!â Quoth he who made the candlesticks! . . . O miserie! Dead-limp, the unbeliever lay Athwart the flags and stopt the way. . . . O miserie! The bold Sir Launcelot mused a bit, And smole a bitter smile at it. O miserie! Gauwaine, he gave his orders brief:â âManants: emportez-moi ce Juif!â O miserie! Some heard the knight not: they that heard Made answer to him none, nor stirred. O miserie! But Braunighrindas was not dumb; Her opportunity had come. O miserie! Her accents tinkled ivory-sweetâ âJe vays l'emporter tout de suite!â . . . O miserie! She bowed her body, slenderly, And lifted him full tenderly: O miserie! Full silverly her stretchÃ¨d throat Intoned the wonted Hebrew note: O miserie! Right broke-in-halfenly she bent; Jew-laden on her way she went! O miserie! The knights all left her one by one, And, leaving, cried in unisonâ O miserie! âVoyez ce vilain Juif qui pend Par derriÃ¨re et par devant!â . . . O miserie! Yet bearing it she journeyed forth, Selecting north-north-east by north. O miserie! The knights (most wisely) with one mouth, Selected south-south-west by south. O miserie! The butcher, baker, and the rest, Said, âLet them go where they like best!â O miserie! And many a wink they wunk, and shook Their heads; but furthermore they took O miserie! No note: it was a way they had, In Camelot, when folks went mad. . . . O miserie! Part 3. She bore her burden all that day Half-faint; the unconverted clay O miserie! A burden grew, beneath the sun, In many a manner more than one. O miserie! Half-faint the whitening road along She bore it, singing (in her song)â O miserie! âThe locks you loved, Gauwaine, Gauwaine, Will never know the comb again! . . . The man you slew, Gauwaine, Gauwaine, Will never come to life again! So when they do, Gauwaine, Gauwaine, Then take me back to town again!â . . . The shepherds gazed, but marvelled not; They knew the ways of Camelot! O miserie! She heeded neither man nor beast: Her shadow lengthened toward the east. O miserie! A little castle she drew nigh, With seven towers twelve inches high. . . . O miserie! A baby castle, all a-flame With many a flower that hath no name. O miserie! It had a little moat all round: A little drawbridge too she found, O miserie! On which there stood a stately maid, Like her in radiant locks arrayed . . . O miserie! Save that her locks grew rank and wild, By weaver's shuttle undefiled! . . . O miserie! Who held her brush and comb, as if Her faltering hands had waxÃ¨d stiff O miserie! With baulkt endeavour! whence she sung A chant, the burden whereof rung: O miserie! âThese hands have striven in vain To part These locks that won Gauwaine His heart!â All breathless, Braunighrindas stopt To listen, and her load she dropt, O miserie! And rolled in wonder wild and blear The whites of her eyes grown green with fear: O miserie! ââWhat is your name, young person, pray?â ââKnights call me Fidele-strynges-le-Fay.â O miserie! ââYou wear a wedding-ring, I see!â ââI do . . . Gauwaine he gave it meâ. . . O miserie! ââAre you Gauwaine his wedded spouse? Is this Gauwaine his . . . country-house?â O miserie! ââI am . . . it is . . . we are . . . oh who, That you should greet me thus, are you?â O miserie! ââI am ANOTHER! . . . since the morn The fourth month of the year was born!â. . . O miserie! ââWhat! that which followed when the last Bleak night of bitter March had past?â. . . O miserie! ââThe same.âââThat day for both hath done! And you, and he, and I, are ONE!â . . . O miserie! Then hand in hand, most woefully, They went, the willows weeping nigh; O miserie! Left hand in left was left to cling! On each a silver wedding-ring. O miserie! And having walkt a little space, They halted, each one in her place: O miserie! And chanted loud a wondrous plaint Well chosen: wild, one-noted, quaint: O miserie! âHeigho! the Wind and the Rain! The Moon's at the Full, Gauwaine, Gauwaine Heigho! the Wind and the Rain On gold-hair woven, and gold-hair plain! Heigho! the Wind and the Rain! Oh when shall we Three meet again!â Atween the river and the wood, Knee-deep 'mid whispering reeds they stood: O miserie! The green earth oozing soft and dank Beneath them, soakt and suckt and sank! . . . O miserie! Yet soak-and-suck-and-sink or not, They, chanting, craned towards Camelot. . . . O miserie! Part 4. The pale wet moon did rise and ride, O'er misty wolds and marshes wide. O miserie! Sad earth slept underneath the yew, Lapt in the death-sweat men call dew. O miserie! O raven ringlets, ringing wet! O bright eye rolling black as jet! O miserie! O matted locks about the chin! O towering head-piece, battered in! O miserie! Three hats that fit each other tight, Are worth the helmet of a knight! O miserie! He rose all shapeless from the mud, His yellow garb was stained with blood; O miserie! âVat ish thish schwimming in mine head? Thish turning round and round?â he said. O miserie! He took three paces through the night, He saw red gold that glittered bright! O miserie! Two Royal Heads of Hair he saw! And One was Woven, and One was Raw! O miserie! âO Sholomon! if there ain't a pair Of dead young damshels shinking there! O Moshesh! vat a precioush lot Of beautiful red hair they've got! The prishe of it would compenshate Most handshome for my broken pate! How much their upper lipsh do pout! How very much their chins shtick out! How dreadful shtrange they shtare! they sheem Half to be dead, and half to dream! The Camelot peoplesh alvaysh try To look like that! I vonder vy? Yet each hath got a lovely fashe! Good Father Jacob shend them grashe! O Jacob! blesh the lovely light, That lit the moon that shtruck the knight, That married the maid that carried the Jew, That shold (as he intensh to do) The golden locks and shilver rings Of Braunighrinde and Fiddleshtrings!â O miserie! Thus having given thanks, he drew His two-fold weapon cutting true; O miserie! And close he clipt, and clean and clear, From crown and temple, nape and ear. O miserie! The wind in pity soughed and sighed! The river beat the river side! O miserie! The willows wept to stand and see The sweetest, softest heads that be, O miserie! In ghastliest baldness gleam dead-white, And sink unhallowed out of sight! O miserie! But, lo, you! Ere kind earth could fold Their shame within its bosom cold, O miserie! The moon had laught in mockery down, And stampt a high-light on each crown!! . . . O miserie! Thrice muttering deep his mystic note, The stillness of the night he smote: O miserie! Then, with a treasure dangling slack From either shoulder adown his back, O miserie! He, whistling in his whistle, strode, Nor felt he faint upon the road! O miserie! You may be sure that it was not The road that leads to Camelot! O miserie! Part 5. The castle weeds have grown so tall Knights cannot see the red brick wall. O miserie! The little drawbridge hangs awry, The little flowery moat is dry! O miserie! And the wind, it soughs and sighs alway Through the grey willows, night and day! O miserie! And evermore two willows there Do weep, whose boughs are always bare: O miserie! At all times weep they, in and out Of season, turn and turn about! O miserie! But later, when the year doth fall, And other willows, one and all, O miserie! In yellowing and dishevelled leaf Sway haggard with their autumn grief, O miserie! Then do these leafless willows now Put forth a rosebud from each bough! O miserie! What time Gauwaine, with spurless heels, Barefoot (but not bare-headed) kneels O miserie! Between! . . . as fits a bigamous knight Twice widowed in a single night: O miserie! And then, for that promiscuous way Of axing Hebrews in broad day, O miserie! He ever uttereth a note Of Eastern origin remote. . . . O miserie! A well-known monochord, that tells Of one who, wandering, buys and sells! O miserie! What time the knights and damsels fair Of Arthur's court come trooping there, O miserie! They come in dresses of dark green, Two damsels take a knight between: O miserie! One sad and sallow knight is fixt Dyspeptic damsels twain betwixt! O miserie! They speak not, but their weary eyes And wan white eyelids droop and rise O miserie! With dim dead gaze of mystic woe! They always take their pleasure so O miserie! In Camelot. . . . It doth not lie With us to ask, or answer, why! O miserie! Yet, seeing them so fair and good, Fain would we cheer them, if we could! O miserie! And every time they find a bud, They pluck it, and it bleeds red blood. O miserie! And when they pluck a full-blown rose, And breathe the same, its colour goes! O miserie! But with Gauwaine alone at night, The willows dance in their delight! O miserie! The rosebuds wriggle in their bliss, And lift them for his lips to kiss! O miserie! And if he kiss a rose instead, It blushes of a deeper red! O miserie! And if he like it, let him be! It makes no odds to you or me! O miserie! O many-headed multitude, Who read these rhymes that run so rude, O miserie! Strive not to fathom their intent! But say your prayers, and rest content O miserie! That, notwithstanding those two cracks He got from Gauwaine's battle-axe, O miserie! The Hebrew had the best of it! So, Gentles, let us rest a bit. O miserie! Verses and Sketches. FLIRTS IN HADES. Ye maids, that practise wicked arts, And eke young widows with light hearts; Gay Guardsmen, and pet parsons dear, And all such heartbreakers, see here! I charge you all, and every one, To waste no love ye may have won, For fear of this grey limbo, where All you fine flirts that ever were Of either sex, shall bud and blow As grafts on rooted stems, and grow, For many a round of days and years, Self-watered with your own salt tears; And wipe your eyes on your own leaves, For lack of pocket-handkerchieves! And wet your lips at your own cost, To whistle for the loves you lost; That these may cast their eyes, and see Fit cause to kiss, and set you free; For if by dint of tears, or trace Of some old unforgotten grace, You chance to charm a stray kiss out Of lips you once were fain to flout, Then may you pluck yourselves, and use Your leaves for pinions, if you choose, To soar upon, and seek for peace; Thus, only thus, the spell shall cease. And trust me, you shall not, I trow, Be beautiful and bright, as now; Your features shall be modelled then By Mr. Punch's smart young men! And here your victims, great and small, Shall whisk about you, one and all; With banded wings like butterflies, And, oh! such beautiful big eyes! And eyelashes an inch at least, And all their wealth of locks increast! And faces brighter than of old, And beautified a billion-fold, And little else but face to show, For having buried long ago Their bodies, and the broken hearts That plagued them so, in foreign parts; In fact, such faces as you see In keepsakes gilded gorgeously! And they shall have sweet kisses too, But none to waste on such as you! No! they shall either cut you dead, Or take to teasing you instead, And point at you, and poke their fun, And try your tempers, one by one, And raise false hopes and lay them low, And pout their lips to kiss, and go! So shall they nip you in the bud, Or leave you sticking in the mud, That you may rue your fickle days Of dancing, and your jilting ways! Till haply you shall culminate In quite a vegetable state, And even run to waste, I wis, And all for want of one poor kiss! POOR PUSSY'S NIGHTMARE. All on a bare and bleak hillside, One night this merry Christmas-tide, A shivering, hunted hare did hideâ Poor Pussy! Though we had hunted Puss all day, The wind had blown her scent away, And baulked the dogsâso there she lay, Did Pussy! There to the earth she humbly creptâ There, brooding o'er her lot, she weptâ There, on her empty stomach, slept Poor Pussy! And there, whilst fell the frozen dew, She dreamt an ugly dream or two, As starved wet folk are apt to do, Did Pussy. Loud hungry hounds of subtle ken, And thundering steeds, and hard-eyed men, Are fast on Pussy's trail againâ Poor Pussy! Onward she strainsâon, on they tear! Foremost amongst the foremost there Are ruthless women's faces fair! Poor Pussy! One moment's check! To leftâto rightâ In vain she spends her little might! Some yokel's eye has marked her flightâ Poor Pussy! What use her five small wits to rack? Closer and faster on her track Hurries the hydra-headed pack! Lost Pussy! âFor pity's sake, kind huntsman, stop! Call off the dogs, before I drop, And kill me with your heavy crop!â Shrieks Pussy! With shuddering start and stifled scream, She wakesâshe finds it all a dream! How kind the cold, cold earth doth seem To Pussy! In harrying Puss we had great fun, And trust that ere this year be done She'll give us yet one other run, Will Pussy! A softer wind, a cloudier sky, A nice damp turf for the scent to lie, Are all we ask! Till then, good-bye, Dear Pussy! THE CONTRAST. At a Sale of Antique Furniture. When the mirror politely stood still for a space, And she viewed herself there in that reeking old place, While the tribes clustered, grinning, all round her sweet face, Such a picture was framed as one don't often see; On our Catalogue's margin we sketched her, pro tem., And just added those lively descendants of Shem For a backgroundâthe brighter and fairer the gem, The darker and plainer the setting should be! The Fools' Paradise, Or Love and Life. âTake up your chain together.â I In and about the Honeymoon, Young Love in his fever gloweth; He waxeth fast, he waneth soon, He cometh, and he goeth. Young Love hath wings that flout his legs, And soareth, Life unheeding; Young Love is the goose with the golden Eggs! And soon he lies a-bleeding! II The road is red with roses sweet, That leads you to his Dwelling With shoes of swiftness on your feet, And Joy there is no telling! And each a cap about the brow, But ne'er the Cap of Knowledge: The Cap of many Bells I trow, Fits best in Young Love's College! III He weaves his bandage round your eyes, He casts his blindness o'er you, That you may dream all Paradise Doth stretch away before you! And dreaming each the other blest With Love's own wings behind you, You dare the Parson do his best For aye and a day to bind you! IV For all a month He bids you fain Go feed among the Posies; And hides the Padlock and the Chain For all a Month of Roses; And gives you nought to care about But Love, till Truth be minded That you should find each other out, And be no longer blinded! V O Love! that all the best of you Be over with the wooing! O Wedlock! All the worst of you That there be no undoing! It's Hey! Ho! and Welladay For Youth and Love, and Honey! It's Heigho! and Workaday For Bread and Cheese, and Money! VI Weep not, poor Fools, nor hold aloof! Take up your chain together, And earthwards pad the wandering hoof That brought you fooling hither! O Help each other, and share the load, For steep the pass and thorny, That leads you thorough from Love's Abode To Life, and rough the Journey! VII ââO Dream of Dreams! O was it worth The pain of this our waking? O what is there of balm on earth Can heal us of our aching? O Love is he dead before the Prime, Love that was born so newly?â . . . âPoor Fools, go pin your faith on Time, And Time shall tell you duly. VIII For Time that scorned Love's earlier ways, His mellower secrets holdeth; These, living out our length of Days, We learn as Truth unfoldeth. Who knows but in a year or two That Love may have the kindness To come without his wings to you, And holpen of his blindness? A LOST ILLUSION. I There was a young woman, and what do you think? She lived upon nothing but paper and ink! For ink and for paper she only did care, Though they wrinkle the forehead and rumple the hair. II And she bought a gold pen, and she plied it so fast That she brought forth her three-volume novel at last; And she called it âThe Ghoul of Mayfair,â by âSirÃ¨neâ; And I read it, re-read it, and read it again. III 'Twas about a young girl, whom the gods, in their grace, Had endowed with a balefully beautiful face; While her lithe, supple body and limbs were as those Of a pantheress (minus the spots, I suppose). IV And oh! reader, her eyes! and oh! reader, her hair! They were red, green, blue, lustreless, lava-like. . . . There! I can't screw my muse to the exquisite pitch For adjusting exactly the whichness of which! V I may mention at once that she'd dabbled in vice From her cradleâand found it exceedingly nice: That she doated on sinâthat her only delight Was in breaking commandments from morning till night. VI And moreover, to deepen her wonderful spell, She was not only vicious, but artful as well; For she managed three husbands at onceâto beginâ (Just by way of a trifle to keep her hand in). VII The first, a bold indigo-broker was he; Not young, but as wealthy as wealthy could beâ The next a fond burglarâand last, but not least, The third was a strapping young Catholic priest! VIII Now, three doating husbands to start with in life Seems a decent allowance for any young wife; But legitimate trigamy very soon palled Upon Barbara Blackshepe (for so she was called). IX And it took but a very few pages to tell How by means of a rope, and a knife, a well, And some charcoal, and poison, and powder and shot, She effectually widowed herself of the lot. X Then she suddenly found that she couldn't control The yearning for love of her ardent young soul, Soâ(this is the cream of the storyâprepare) She took a large house in the midst of Mayfair: XI Where she started a kind of a sort of aâeh? Well, a sort of a kind of aâwhat shall I say? Like Turkey, you knowâonly just the reverse; Which, if possible, makes it a little bit worse! XII There were tenors, priests, poets, and parsonsâa host! And Horseguards, and Coldstreams regardless of cost; While a Leicester-square agent provided a tale Of select refugees on a liberal scale. XIII The nobility, gentry, and public all round Her immediate vicinity threatened and frowned; Some went even so far as to call and complain; But they never went back to their spouses again! XIV Nay, the very policemen that knocked at the door To remonstrate were collared, and never seen more; And 'tis rumoured that bishops deserted their lambs To enrol among âBarbara's Rollicking Rams.â XV And their dowdy, respectable, commonplace wives, And ridiculous daughters all fled for their lives, And all died with disgusting decorum elsewhere, To the scorn of âSirÃ¨neâ and her âGhoul of Mayfairâ! XVI (This lightâI might even add frivolousâtone Isn't that of the author, 'tis fair I should own; Passion hallows each pageâguilt ennobles each line; All this flippant facetiousness, reader, is mine.) XVII To our muttons. Who dances, the piper must pay, And we can't eat our cake and yet have it, they say; So we learn with regret that this duck of a pet Of a dear little widow, she ran into debt. XVIII And the Hebrew came down like the wolf on the fold (With his waistcoat all gleaming in purple and gold), And the auctioneer's hammer rang loud in the hall, And they sold her upâharem and scar'em and all! XIX Then, says she: âThere are no more commandments to break; I have livedâI have lovedâI have eaten my cake!â (Which she had, with a vengeance); so what does she do? Why, she takes a revolver, and stabs herself through! XX Now, this naughty but nice little Barbara B. Had, I own, amongst others, demoralised meâ And the tale of her loves had excited me so That I longed its fair passionate author to know. XXI For, oh! what's more seductive than vice, when you find It with youth, beauty, genius, and culture combined! Sweet âSirÃ¨ne!â How I yearnedâhow I burned for her! nay, I went secretly, silently wasting away! XXII Well, at last I beheld herâit did thus befall: I was wasting away at the Tomkins's ball, Half inclined to be sick, in my loathing profound For the mild goody-goody flirtations all roundâ XXIII When my hostess said suddenly: âSo glad you came, Tho' you may find us somewhat insipid and tame! I've a great treat in store for youâturn, and look there! That's âSirÃ¨ne,â who indited âThe Ghoul of Mayfair.ââ XXIV Oh! the wild thrill that shot thro' this passionate heart! Thereâbefore meâalone in her gloryâapart From that milksoppy, maudlin, contemptible throng, Sat the being I'd yearned for and burned for so long! XXV I respectfully gazed one brief momentâbut stop! For particulars, vide design at the top: See picture on preceding page. She's that sweet, scornful pet in black velvet you see Near the nice little man in blue goggles. That's me. TWO THRONES. Oh, Beauty, peerless as thou art, And wide thy range, and keen thy dart. And meek the captives of thy bow, Inconstant beats the manly heartâ The present Bard's extremely so! Wit, Wisdom, Strength, and Valour meet (The Bard amongst them), at thy feet To kneel in homage, as of old; Yet turn a rival Queen to greet, Whose crown is of a purer gold! Preen as thou wilt thy feathers fine, A gift is hers, by grace divine, Even more potent to enthral, O Bird of Paradise, than thine, The hearts and souls of one and all! And what avail thy gilded crest, The silver shimmer of thy breast, The glories of thy painted wing, If, yielding to the Bard's behest, The Nightingale vouchsafe to sing! A LOVE-AGONY. So an thou be, that faintest in such wise, With love-wan eyelids on love-wanton eyes, Fain of thyself! I faint, adoring thee, Fain of thy kisses, fainer of thy sighs, Yet fainest, love! an thou wert fain of me, So an thou be! Yea, lo! for veriest fainness faint I, Sweet, Of thy spare bosom, where no shadows meet, And small strait hip, and weak delicious knee! For joy thereof I swoon, and my pulse-beat Is as of one that wasteth amorously, So an thou be! Shepherd art thou, or nymph, that ailest there? Lily of Love, or Rose? Search they, who care, Thy likeness for a sign! For, verily, Naught reck I, Fairest, so an thou be but Fair! E'en as he recks not, that hath limnÃ¨d thee, So an thou Be! A Simple Story. I There lived a youth (he liveth yet), And Richard was he christened; And well he played the flageolet, And all the ladies listened; And some were even heard to say His brow was handsome (in its way). II But Richard met Ben Ball, a man All chest, and cheek, and shoulder, And ever so much bigger than Himself, though little older; Whose biceps Richard felt and found It measured fifteen inches round! III Now this demoralised him quite; And then he took to reading The naughty books that ladies write And found there, with exceeding Dismay, that ladies' heroes are Wild, wicked men, and muscular! IV Then in high dudgeon did he use To feel himself all over; But little sinew, and no thews Could Richard's thumbs discover; And wickedness is rarely met In men that play the flageolet. V But 'twas not yet too late to mend; He got dumb-bells, and shyly He took the counsel of a friend (âExperimentum viliâ) And tried them first on his left arm, And found they acted like a charm! VI Much bigger waxed his biceps, but When this left arm was finished, The left lobe of his occiput Had sensibly diminished; So then he went it, right and all, To make his nut symmetrical! VII His nut soon got so hardened that It hurt you when you hit it; Nor could his hatter find a hat (Already made) to fit it, So marvellously small it grew, As all may judge from this back view. VIII At length a happy day came round (Which I was there, and drew it) When Richard lifted from the ground A paving-stone, and threw it Almost one foot three-quarters high! And that with ladies standing by!! IX Not only that; he, on his head So dexterously caught it, That all the ladies present said They never should have thought it! And even I could not but own 'Twas hard lines for the paving-stone! X Next day he caught a cold, alack! And all his muscles vanished, But none of his old brains came back Which is dumb-bells had banished; And not a rack was left behind Of what he chose to call his mind! XI Poor Richard now (O have you met Him lately) has grown bitter; For when he plays the flageolet The ladies talk and titter; And no one ever thinks his brow In any way good-looking now! XII O little men, who wish to please, Be wiser than poor Dick! shun Big friends with brawny bicipes, And female works of fiction; But stick to music all your might, Or be cut out. And serve you right! A Ballad of Blunders. (AFTER SWINBURNE'S BALLAD OF BURDENS.) The Blunder of Short Garments. Thou shalt wear Thy supple thighs in sheaths of splendid fit, Much use whereof shall surely render bare The mystery, yea, the very threads of it; And cold shall seize thee standing; should'st thou sit, Thy skin shall vex thee with its tenderness; Or stoop, thy perilous underseam shall split; This is the end of every man's excess. The Blunder of Gay Seasons. Strange delight; Thy seething garb shall cleave to thee, and cling; Thy red wet palm shall reek beneath the white; And fierce black shining leather bite and sting, A future of sore troubles gathering; The dawn shall send thee, cold and comfortless, Creeping along the kerb, an abject thing. This is the end of every man's excess. The Blunder of Much Music. Sit thee down, Nay, stop thine ears, and sleep. For verily, She that is playing heedeth not thy frown, And she that singeth takes no thought for thee; And song shall follow song till thou shalt be Smitten and bitten with fierce restlessness To bite and smite in turn, or turn to flee; This is the end of every man's excess. The Blunder of Great Banquets. Out of sight, Beyond the reach of hands that heal for gain, The dish of thy desire and thy delight Shall vex thy sleep. Thou shalt behold again The Lord Knight Mayor, thy host, as King of Pain; And lo, the worthy lady Mayoress As Queen of Pleasure in thy fond heart shall reign; This is the end of every man's excess. The Blunder of Long Speeches. Thou shalt burn To see men whisper, and thy voice grow thick, And shame shall stain thee red and white by turn, And all thy wine shall rise and make thee sick; And short swift sobs shall take thy breath betw-hic! And in thy skull shall be much emptiness, And in thy stead, the likeness of a stick. This is the end of every man's excess. The Blunder of Late Hours. Leave thy sad bed; See what strange things shall grieve thy straining sight: Stray broken glass to greet the dawn; grey dead Strewn ashes of the weeds of thy delight; Sick sterile leavings of the hot fierce night; Yet must thou bend thee to thy business Thy brain to brood; thy tremulous hand to write; This is the end of every man's excess. Blunder of Strong Spirits; warm and sweet, Or cold without, and pale; whereof to tread The wild wet ways is perilous to thy feet, And in thine eyes, where green was, lo, the red; And where thy sinew, soft weak fat instead; Burning of heart, and much uneasiness About thy girdle, and aching in thine head; This is the end of every man's excess. The Blunder of Much Rhyming. If thou write That once again that should be once for all, These market-men will buy thy black and white Till thy keen swift full fervent ways shall fall On sated ears; thy stinging sweetness pall; And barren memories of thy bright success Shall burst in thee the bladder of thy gall; This is the end of every man's excess. The Blunder of Long Ballads. Bide in peace; For when the night is near, the day shall die, And when the day shall dawn the night shall cease, And all things have an end of all; and I An end of this, for that my lips are dry, And the eleventh hour's exceeding heaviness Doth overweigh mine eyelid on mine eye . . . This is the end of every man's excess. MORAL. Poets, who tread the fast and flowerful way, Heed well the burden these sad rhymes impress; Pleasure is first, and then the time to pay; This is the end of every man's excess. Chatouillard.</field>
