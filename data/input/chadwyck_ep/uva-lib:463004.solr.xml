[Wh? shal this time, of trauail cease] The wishes, of the wise, Whiche long, to be at reste: To GOD, with lifted iyes, Thei call, to be redreste. Wh? shal this time, of trauail cease Which we with wo sustayne, Wh? shal the daies, of rest &amp; peace Returne to vs agayne. When shall the minde, bee moued right To leaue hys lustyng life When shall our mocions, and delight Be free from wrath and strife. When shall the tyme, of wofull teares bee moued vnto myrth, When shall the aged, with gray heares Reioyce at childrens byrth. When shall Hierusalem reioyce, In him that is their Kyng: And Sion hill, with cherefull voyce Synge Psalmes, with triumphyng. When shall the walles, erected bee That foes, with furie fraye When shall that perfect, oliue tree Geue odour, like the baye. When shall the vineyard, bee restorde That beastlye Bores, deuour When shall the people, late abhorde Receyue a quiet houre. When shal the spirite, more feruent be In vs that want good wyll, When shall thy mercies, set vs free From wickednesse and yll. When shall the Serpentes, that surmise To poyson thine electe, Be bounde to better exercise, Or vtterly reiecte. When shall the bloude, reuenged be Which on the earth is shed When shall synne, and iniquitie Be caste into the bed. When shall that man, of synne appeare To bee euen as he is, When shal thy babes, and children dere Receyue eternall blisse. When shall that painted, hore of Rome. Be cast vnto the grounde, When shal her children, haue their dome Which vertue woulde confounde. When shall thy spouse, and turtle done Be free from bitter blaste, When shal thy grace, our sinnes remoue With pardon at the laste. When shal this lyfe translated bee From fortunes fickell fall, When shall true faith, and equitie Remaine in generall. When shall contention, and debate For euer slake and cease, When shall the daies, of euill date Be tourned vnto peace. When shall trew dealing, rule the reste With those that bye and sell, And single minde, in euery ceaste Among vs bide and dwell. When shall our mindes, wholy conuerte From wealth, and worldlye gayne When shall the mouynges, of our harte From wickednes refrayne. When shall this fleshe, retourne to duste From whence the same did spryng When shal the triall of our trust, Appeare with triumphyng. Wh? shal the trumpe, blow out his blast And thy defe babes reuiue, When shal the hoare, be headlong cast That sought vs to depryue. When shall thy Christ, our kyng apeare With power and renowne: When shall thy sainctes, that suffer here Receyue their promest crowne. When shall the faithfull, firmely stande Before thy face to dwell: When shall thy foes, at thy lyfte hande Be caste into the hell. Come Lorde Iesu. Apoca. 22. T. B.</field>
