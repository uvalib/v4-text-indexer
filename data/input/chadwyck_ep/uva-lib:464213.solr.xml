      <field name="fulltext">[To the] bewteous: to the all-illustrious, and most puissaunt creatures of the Earth, VVOEMEN: Willyam Goddard, sole desirer of th'yncrease of your bewtyes, and chiefe adorer of your goddes-like vertues, (with al reuerence to your Angelicall sex,) commendes to your protection this harsh vnlearned DIALOGVE. Starrs of this earthlie heaun, you whose essence Composd was of mans purest quyntessince, To you (to virtuous you) J dedicate This snaggy sprigg, hew'd from a crabby pate Wherein (Celestiall bewties) you shall see, Howe old Diogynes extolleth yee. We men, doe loue to see our selues vp-raisd And Jocond are, o heare our own selues praisd But (oh you springes of Wisdome) J doe find That is a thing most hatefull to your kind. Yet old Diogynes did see your worth, Such worth hee sawe, as needes heed paint it forth. Accept his loue; for all the Cynnicks deedes Out of true zeale vnto your sex proceedes With rev'rent zeale, as high as th'azurd skyes Your virtuous deedes, the old man magnifies. Contrary wise, he with a bitter penn Jnvectivelie, doth write against bad men Comanunding them, that what soe e're they doe, They alwaies should example take by you. Badd are these men, such is their perverse kind They burne all bookes, wherein theire faults they find And therefore (earthlie aungells) my desire Js you'l protect this, from consuming fire. The euer-faythfull honourer of your celestyall Sex Willyam Goddard. To the senceles Censurer. Rash Reader, read my booke, and when tis read Disdaynefullie through't o're thy muddy head Thy condemnations peale a both sides ringe: Rash men are priviledgd t'saie anie thing And therefore (hare-braine) reade, criemewe dislike: My spleene swells not when fooles with bables strike. Pack hence precision: cry'st it is obsceane? Diue deeper shallowe pate: knowe what I meane Knowe what I meane? alas! what hope haue I? Since carpers mindes haue but a pore blynd eye Yet to prevent thy censures thus much knowe Whollye this booke was made, follie to showe And he which laies ope tymes abuse, and vice Are sildome blam'd of men Iudicious wise: At which I ay'md; and therefore duncepate hence Or looke for lashes for thy rude offence. William G. A SATIRYCALL DIALOGVE OR A SHARPLYE-INVECTVIE CONFERENCE Betweene ALLEXANDER THE GREATE, and that Trulye Woman-hater Diogynes. Alexander. Why howe nowe Cynnick, what dust doe a daies That thou in tubb art coop't-vp thus alwaies? Diogynes. What doe I doe? not daunce from howse to howse To bibb in wynes sweete Iuice, eache dambd corrowse Nor doe I gallop it from place to place To veiwe each faire bewitching painted face Nor studdye howe, this populous world to wynn My studdy's howe, to beate and conquer synn I studdye not wherewith my gutts to cramm On what soe ere I feede, well pleasd I am. To mee's all one the fyn'st and grossest meate So't wholesome be, I nere care what I eate. With in my selfes a world, and it is true I howrlie fight, all that world to subdue And these fell-fighters bee the enymies, That rebell-like, againste me dailie rise Vaine Pryde (my cheifest foe) the leading hath Of these feirce-foes: loathd, drunkenues and Wrath With Averice, Sloathe, Gluttonie, and Lust, Encounter hottlie eu'rie daie I must To beate downe these, I daylie doe devise: To this end, I vse strentgh and pollicies: I studdy not, nor trouble I my witt Howe I by flatt'ry should be fauouritt, Vnto greate Allexander. I would refuse To be that monarchs selfe, If I might chuse. Allexander. Thou wouldst not; woudst? Diogynes. I would by Ioue I vowe Allexander. Alas (poore sillie snake) why what art thou? Diogynes. What thou art not: I am an honest man And then (I hope) the more vnlike thee than, I am noe Courtyer I, for once by chaunce I with an other mans faire wife did daunce Yet Icie-vayned I (vnsett a fire) Did freeze moste coldlie, in loues hott desire: I did indeed: but doe you heare me hoe? Was e're hott-blouded Courtyer frozen soe? I am noe Lawyer I, for once there was A poore man praide me vndertake his case Quoth he, praie vndertakt and you shall haue your fee Though you sitt dumb, and nothing speake for me. But I refusd it I: yet harke you hoe What Lawyer ere refusd, and tempted soe? I am noe younger-brother, brauelie sprighted For once a vsring golden Asse (be nighted) Quite laden, with his full stuft treasure baggs; By me that dreaming drudge, all feareles laggs Yet honest I (vntempted with this sight) Thou emptie mayd, at this baite would not bite Hence capring Courtyer ask you who I am? Goe, gett you hence, scudd quick from whence you came. Allexander. Cynnick you are to sharpe did you but knowe me I am assurd more reu'rence you would showe me. Diogynes. Howe? I showe reverence? noe, vnderstand That Allexander getts none at my hand. Allexander. In faithe Diogynes thou haste not beene, In all thy life, where anie thing th'ast seene. Yf thoudst but trauayle and some fashions see, Thoudst aunswere none, as nowe thou aunswerst me. Diogynes. Haue I not trauayld? ha? yes yes I trowe, (Spruce fellowe) thou haste neuer trauaild soe. Where I haue bene, theres fewe hath euer beene But yet men saie noe wonders I haue seene, Why once I sawe, a ritch-left heire to weepe, When's old dadd tooke his euerlasting sleepe. Once did I see a bewteous maide (tis straunge!) Liue twentie yeares, yet not that title chaunge Once did I see a wife in mourninge weede Shedd teares ouer hir husbands course indeed I once did see a Cytizens faire wife Liue at the Courte, he leading else wher'es life And hee (ins witt) noe wiser then an asse Yet was hee brow'd, more smothe then smothest glasse Once did I see a King giues foes the foile And gaue his souldyers leaue, to take the spoile And lastlie once I was in such a Court Where 'bout the King, noe flattrers did resort Where I haue beene, oh surelie none haue beene, Then why saie you, noe wonders I haue seene? Allexander. Why faith Diogynes me thinkes these are, Nor things (as thou wouldst make em) wondrous rare The like in eu'rie place and realme I see Th'are comon, man, they ordynarie be. Diogynes. Those ordynarie thinges? I fayth sir noe; These thinges, are th'ordynarie thinges, I trowe To see faire bewtious ladies nowe a daies Refuse to take at once both pricke, and praise Of both the'ile not accept, for still those men Which gives the one, shall tother haue agenn. The other thinges? why! those are wondrous rare These be the thinges that ordynarie are To see howe Lords shake-of their serving men And howe their ladies take them on agen Holding em in (vnto their Lords vnknowne) To ride in private, with them vp and downe T'see mercers bookes fild-vp with courtyers names To see your mincyng bewteous cyttie dames Haue alwaies some one gallant of the court, (As knisman to them) to theire howse resort. To see, a plaine kind man loue none soe much As he which giues his pate the cuckolds tutch These; these are ordynarie man: also This thing is as much ordynarie too To see your ritch old country squires to wedd Their chamber maides vnto theire servaunts bedd But firste themselues to take the maydenhead Then place them in some cottage nere at hand To haue theire service, readie at comaund. Thou saydst the first were ordynarie thinges: Awaie awaie: why man to see on Kinges Howe Daunger plaine, cloathd smoothly-smiling Daunger Wayteth on them attending like noe straunger But like some smyling, countenanced freind Onelie to giue too's Prince, his fatall end: Thoult say perhaps, this is noe common thing But thoud'st vn say't againe wert thou a King What thinges are common, and not common be, Thy shallowe reatch, cannot conceaue I see. Allexander. Naie fie Diogynes infaith thou art, In thy conclusions still a dram, to tart I pray thee lett me soe prevaile with thee As ride to Allexanders court with mee Twill mend thee much, and I will vndertake, The King shall byd thee welcome for my sake. Diogynes. Vnto my Tubb, lett Allexander come I'me in a Pallace, when I'me in this home Let those that list, vnto thy King resort, T is not my list: what should I doe at's court? Allexander. As others doe; in spending of smale pelfe, Thou maiste in tyme to honour raise thy selfe. Diogynes. I cannot fawne, my tongue too rustie is; I bashfull am; I'm nothing boldlie rude I rather chuse Court delecates to misse Then with a brazen face my selfe ty'ntrude: In tubb (coop't-vp) I will liue euer mude And euer liue vppon sowre garden woortes Er'e Ile' a flattr'er be, and followe cortes I cannot turne my tongue to praise and laude A soone-lamb'd prick-eard proud-feerce firy steed I cannot Fyndalls full deepe mouth applaude Nor swaere the greate-mans grew hound hath best speed When hee doth plaie the slowe-slugg curr indeed Though some cann doo't, yet such is my sowre, kind I neuer could, though't gall's his sweld pust mind I cannot tell the greate foole hee is wise, Nor tell fowle ladies, they are wondrous faire I ne're applaude aboue heauns-spangled skies The curld-worne tresses, of dead-borrow'd haire Like Northern blaste I breathe my crittick aire: I am noe Mimyck ape, I loathe and hate, Each light-braind, giddy-head to Imy rate I cannot brooke, to suck the livings bloud Of these old Vsrer's ritch-left prodigalls I nourish not with such sweete-bitter food: I hate to rise by other mens downe falls I knowe tis Ill though other think tis good Though some doe think such papp all sweete to be Yet I doe not; it poyson proues to mee. To make short worke, I neuer loud'vaine sportes And therefore I'me vnfitt for Prynces Courtes? Allexander. Diogynes, thou art deceyued quite In vanities Kinges take the least delight Ile vndertake none shall respected bee (Yf thou wilt followe him) better then thee Come to the Court, and then in seeing him Thou also maiste, take veiwe of ladies trymm Mee thinkes, hee is too dull and sadd of spright That in a bewteous dame takes noe delight. Why hee that's mary'd is in heaun all night. Diogynes. There lett him bee, for I had rather dwell A thousaud tymes, a single man in hell I am assurd that ther'es noe Divell cann (Like to a wife) torment a mary'd man. Il'e none of them, I'me euer worse a yeare When once I doe, a womans tongue but heare It galls my gutts when I a woman see Ile not once come, where such straunge creatures be Come hold your tongue, and prate no more to me Allexander. Naie good Diogynes bee not soe quick I hope yet 'ere I die, see thee loue sick Diogynes. Loue-sicke? why I doe loue these women soe As I'me soe fonde, I knowe not what to doe Such is my loue vnto the femall Kind As were I Empr'our of thynfernall lake But women, none with me should fauour synd One man into my Kingdome Jd'e not take Ide' send my servaunts out, to scarch and see To bring all women in the world to mee. Allexander. Byth masse Diogynes thou loust em well Wert thou the King and gouernour of hell Thou wouldst I see advaunce the women kind There is noe want of will hadst to thy mind Wert thou (I see) the prince of that faire place Women, (onelie) with thee should be in grace I see thoudst very carles be of men I see thoudst women haue, t'attend thee then. Diogynes. I that I would, and this they should be bold Ide carefull be they should not freeze with cold Allexander. I fayth Diogynes I doubt th'ast euer Beene privatelie a vild laciuious liuer Or neuer haste beene yet (I greatelie feare) Where anie one faire vertuous creature weare. Diogynes. Nor nere will looke to be: I am too wise To thinke that vertue cann remaine in vice Allexander. Wert thou at Court, thou'dst alter then thy mind When women thou didst see, soe wondrous kind Forsake this Tubb, t'is solliterie Ill And howe to court faire ladies, learne the skyll. Diogynes. Nowe, by the lustfull fire hott boiling vaines Of that same wanton greate god Iupiter I am vnskild in these speech-pleasing straines To courte a wenche when I come vnto hir I'me then an all-mute dumb and surlie sir I cannot lispe, nor cann I courtlike saie, When I doe women woe, I runn my waie. I cannot singe, nor cann I turne my tongue To chaunte a Syren-charming quau'ring dittye When I these bewties chaunce to come amonge My lead-sade-sable lookes must moue their pittie All what is in me then, is all vnwittie I want these warbling noates to wynn their loues Nor cann I pricksong sett, which better moues I cannot musick it, nor finger fyne A sweete-cleare-throated, eare-charme instrument I'me not posseste with such sweet parts devyne Whereby to cause, faire bewties merryment T'ynchaunt theire eares nothing cann I invent And well knowe I, that women take delight In these same instruments, both daie and night I cannot daunce, nor with my sprawling heeles Cann I the ny'mble cutt-heele caper kick My sullen bloud an other humor feeles To woe a wench, I want the wanton trick I am a milksopp then, I then am sick Againe, strenghes moysture in may vaines is skant, Which women after dauncing must not want. And therefore pry thee fellowe lett me reste Of all these worldly Courts, my Tubb's the best. Allexander. Diogines, my meaning is mistooke I would not, that your Tubb be quite forsooke But for your recreation nowe and then Youd' goe too th'Court, from court t'your tubb agen. Mistake me not, it will for your good tend A wiseman alwaies lysten will too's freind. Diogynes. Naie would you would these complementes forbeare For Courtyers freindshipps, I did neuer care Yet should I chuse a freind, a Courtyer than I would make choise-of, fore another man: By this example I will plainelie proue That like to Courtyers, none doe truelie loue Like to apparrell they doe loue theire freind To what (like that) doe they theire loues extend: Like cloathes they loue theire freindes: why that is true Iust like em, cause they nere loue cloathes but newe: Pack hence, for such loue should I find of you. Allexander. Naie fye Diogynes you cann (yf lift) Forbeare to plaie this crabb-sowre satirist I pry thee Cynnick broach thy milder braine And let thy wordes runn in a sweeter vaine In others natures too too much you markst, Against theire faultes too rufly loud you barkst I doe dislike it I, I pry thee cease Thoud'st gaine more loue, yf thou didst hold thy peace: Turne courtyer man, come, be thou pollitick wise He best wynns loue, that best cann sooth-vp vice. Diogynes. Then Ile' wynn hate: nor King nor Clowne Ile' spare Yf they with vices vennym poysned are Yf with Prides swellinge tympany I fynd Theire hartes are once puft-vp; Ile speake my mind. Let's pate be crownd, with hundred thowsand crownes Lett cruell deathe, succeed his wrathfull frownes Yet (yf in him) loathd filthie synns I see Hee shall not (in them) sooth'd-vp-be, by mee I cannot soothe; I am not that waies wise: Who liveth not in vertue, dies in vice. Allexander. Thou sayst well Cynnick, for I hold this race Of oyld-tongu'd flattrers, to be dangerous base The cankerd rust, doth not the Iron frett Soe faste as these, doe in good natures eate The statelie oake a longer tyme would liue Yf to the Ivie, he noe truste did giue But as the Ivie', 'boute the oake entwyndes To worke his fall; so't fares with flattrers mindes. But whether in discourse, shall our tongues walke? I came not here, of court affaires to talke I came to see, thy manner kind of life And t'aske thee, why thou getst thee not a wife. Faith gett thee one, I would not lie alone Yf all the world could but afford mee one. Diogynes. A wife? why for my life I cannot see Howe man, with woman, euer should agree When men goe backward, and goe downe the wynd It frettes, cuttes, galles, and greiveth sore the mind When women backward growe, and downeward goe Theire spleenes, with laughter tickles then I trowe: Since their two natures, are soe contrarie I muse howe tweene them, cann be sympathie A wife? oh fellowe tha'rt a younge man yet Ther'es much sowre sawce, belonges to that sweete bitt: Who would be troubled with the yawling noyse Of a harsh-whewling young childes whympring voice Againe, to see em fligger, smile, and plaie Doth make mee greiue as much an other waie When they doe simper, I doe sighe; for then I mynd the miseries, theyl see (ere men.) Twould cutt my heart to heare a babe crye dadd Oh giue me meate: when tis not to be hadd He that doth wiue, for pleasures sole intent Tis tenn to one, but soone he will repent. Who would be bound to scrape, pinch, carke, and care For brattes, (perhapps) that gott by others are? Not I: Ile' none of this thing, cald a wife Let him take one, that's wearie of his life For hee that alwaies will supplies' wiues lack Must vnto Nature goe, for a steele back. A wife? Ile ha noe wife: such sprights will frowne Vnles they (er'e a non) are coinurd' downe: Againe my little Tubb is too too small To hold my wife, my selfe, and whom shee'le call It must not be a smale howse that cann hold A silent man, ioynd with a shrill-tongud schold Nowe will hir gossipps come; then praie nowe where Is roome for them to chatt, and make good cheere? And nowe hir old-acquainted freind will come (Perhapps to see hir, when I'me from my home) Then where's my galleree, for them to walk? Or anie place for old freindes secrett talk? Some what perhapps theyd' doe, I should not see: Where haue I chambers then for them to bee? Not in my Tubb my Tubb hath not the scope For hir to gossip't, with hir mates I hope. Yet though I haue noe wife (with hott desire) My harte is flamd: burnt am I with loues fire A loue I haue to whom I will be true Obserue hir partes, I will discribe them you My loues pure white hath ne're sustaind a spot She's wise, good, rich, faire, chaste, what is shee not? Hir eyes, grace, speach; hath fir'd, amaz'd, rauisht, My harte, sence, thoughts; with loue, wonder, delight, But fyr'd, 'mazd, sence-rest; J sought, prayde, and wisht, To quenche, cure, and heale; loue, sence, and eyes-dymd sight Thus eyes, grace, speache; hath fyr'd, amazd, sence-charmd My thoughts, sence, witts, with loue, with feare, vnarmd Oh my loue's fairelie white without a spott Such is hir hue noe staine hir hue can blott Uirtue's that Dame in hir sweete grace I sitt 'Tis shee loues me, she'es womans oppositt, Could I one headles lymb les corp les see To such a one would I betrothed be For had shee nere a head; noe tongue sheed haue: Nor corps; then Ide not dread the lechrous knaue: Nor lymb; then should I neuer quiv'ring stand Fearing my eares remembraunce of hir hand Of rope or hangman I was nere afrayde At noe sight quake I but at wife or maide. Allexander. Oh harsh-sowre, crabby Cynnick, still I see To gentle creatures thou wilt stubborne be If with a girle thast neuer slept a night Thy soule hath neuer tasted sweete delight, Such is the femall sex, while wife or maide As of them, too much good, cannot be saide Me thinkes the skipping bloud (a Virgins grace) Which tripps lavaltoes in each maydens face When mens fowle tongues, o're-flowes with ribaldery Should make thee loue maides, for theire modestie. Diogynes. Maydens modest? what is this modestie? Yf t'is in them, it is a vice saie I Vertue in women is as cold as Ice: Nothinge is warme in them vnlest be vice. Thou art a dunce, thou haste noe reatche I see Why Maydes at all tymes cann faine modestee. Theil' blush as oft while they liue single liues As they will weepe, when they be mary'd wiues: If twas my liste, I could a thowsand name That would (yf men talke Ill) blush at the same Yet by themselues, their tongues shall nimblie walke Whole nights togeather, all in too-broad talk. Allexander. Thou wrongst em soore: I doe not think it I That maydens tongues, will tripp Immodestlie. Diogynes. Thou doost not, doost? I prithee think soe still: I think thy witt is like a womans will But what thou dost not think, I trulie knowe: What I haue saide of maydes men shall find soe I fellowe, fellowe, till theire by themselues Maydes in talke are modest bashfull elues But beinge from the companie of men The lawes of modestie is broken then. Twas not longe since I stood to maydens neere But Lord! thou't ne're beleeue what I did heare For onelie that same wench esteemd' was well Which could the ribauldst dreame, relate and tell: I could relate all what they did relate But that my tongues, disvs'd to such like prate 'Tis vild obscene; speake younge man wilt you hav't? Allexander. Come, out with't Cynnick, I knowe thy delight Is, all in all to worke faire woomen spight. DIOGINES RELATES the three wanton Sisters wanton dreames. Diogynes. Over the fyer, once three maydens satt Vnknowne to them, I ouer heard theire chatt Eache with hir tuckt-vp cloathes, in pleasing plight (Pleasing I meane vnto fond younge mens sight) Satt ore the fyer, soe, as one might see, From slender foote, to round white nimble knee As thus they satt, I'me sure thou doest thinke what (When maydes with maydens bee) wilbe theire chatt Girles (quoth the eldest sister) what shall's doe? Smal'es my desire, vnto my bedd to goe For yet, I never in my couche could fynd A sportiue mate to please my mayden mind Alas, alas, what pleasure and delight Takes one mayde with an other in the night? But smale god knowes it, for my owne part I Ne're tooke anie with whom I e're did lie. For loue, noe revells in that bedd doth keepe Where one girle, by an others side doth sleepe. For trulye (sisters) there is none that can Giue maydes delight in bedd, but a young man And but in dreame (the more vnhappie I) I ne're with such a beddfellowe could lie But yet in dreame (oh matchles sweete delightes!) Iv'e lyne, and lyne, with one whole wynters nightes The greater greife (you'l saie) 'twas to my mind When I did wake, and my selfe single fynd. Oh girles it was! but sisters I doe see, It is with eu'rye mayde as 'tis with mee. Such are our dreames, as wee doe laugh in sleepe But when wee wake againe, oh then wee weepe. But what shalls' doe? wee'l not soe soone to bedd Letts rather tell, howe ne're wee haue beene spedd. Our merry'st dreames come lett vs nowe relate Girles gott with girles, their mindes maie freelie prate What though w'are maides? here are noe men to heare vs Freelie wee vse to chatt, when th'are not nere vs W'are by our selues: what ere we talke, is well Come letts drawe lotts, which first hir dreame shall tell. At which the youngest, blushing like a rose Being assignd by lott, firste to disclose Begynns to tell howe to hir soules delight Hir sences ravisht' were, the other night. THE YOVNGEST Sisters dreame. Qoth shee, on bedds softe downe downe did J lie And snugd doowne close, to haue sleepe close eache eye But ere twould bee, I entred in a muse (I such a muse as all wee maydens vse) J mus'd (me thought) yf there were sweeter blisse For maydes, then't lie with men, to clipp and kisse Me thought, J thought (this thought fetcht out a groane) It was a hell to lie, all night alone, At which I sight, and turning me J wept Desiring, what I knowe not, till J slept Jn which my sleepe (oh fancies sweete delight?) Appeard a youth (Pheobus was much lesse bright) Gold were his lockes, firye sparkles were his eyne His browes, cheekes, and chynn were as louelie fyne J'ns shirte was hee, a shirt soe fyne I wynn As one might see, what was tweene shirt and skynn His snowe-white armes, in-laide with azurd vaine (Mixed with crimson dye) one might see plaine His full-broade manlie some-what downye cheste Dale-like indented tweene two mounting brestes; On which two prettie fruiteles teatlinges grewe: Not milkie sweete, sweete onelie for the veswe. J saw's soft slender waste; and sisters well nie I sawe what grewe beneathe his plump-round bellie: All what I sawe (sweete wenches) J would tell ye But that sweete loue coniures me (heres' the spight) Not to discribe, mans sweetly-sportiue spright: Oh sweet's the dreame, which yeeldeth such delight! But come girles come; (fye whether doe I roame?) Me thinkes but coldlie J tooth purpose come: To me he came, and kiste me too; when J Me thought did faine, I did a sleeping lie Me thought, I lett him kisse and kisse agenn And touche me too (maydes maie be toucht by men.) I sisters, faythe (me thinkes) that maide's vnwise That will in private, to hir loue be nice Two faythfull lovers cannot synn I weene Soe what they doe, by others is not seene. Nowe would the wagg, be stroaking of my face And nowe my pappes, anon another place Delighting of himselfe, sisters you can (Better then J) tell what best likes a man But fayth-la girles, J cannot chuse but smile I laie, as yf J soundlie slept the while Permitting him to please the appetite Of his too too-fond, youth-lust-burning sight Fayning, J soundest slept, when hee did steale To vnhill that which maides should cheifst conceale But, when as hee'd haue come into my bedd The feare I had to loose my maydenhead Awaked me: Quoth thother sisters, what? J hope we maydens least of all feare that Beleeue me (quoth the elder girle) should J With my sweete-hart, on my wedding-night lie And find him drowsie dull, like heauie lead Hunting but coldlie for a maydenhead: Twould kill my tender hart: twould murder mee The blushing morne I nere should liue to see Oh J should fill the roome with groanes: in morne With lookes deiected J should seeme forlorne. But when you wakt (quoth she) chast you not then Oh noe! in that case maides nere chafe with men Though wee seeme angry, at there boldest partes Yet seldome comes, our anger from out hartes For in loues sporte (this is our sexes wyle) We'el seeme to frowne when most of all we smile Yet sisters faith (quoth shee) me thought J wept When J did wake, cause J noe longer slept For trath-la girles such pleasure in't tooke J As in like dreame, twould nere greiue me to die Had I a world, Jd'e giv't to learne the skyll Howe J should sleepe and dreame soe at my will. Had I that arte, that matchles pleasing slyght Fewe daies Jd'e haue, eache daie Jd'e turne to night: Lye downe J would, lulling my selfe a sleepe, Bidding my soule delightfull revells keepe: Sild would I wake, but alwaies by my will Jde sleepe, and dreame, and he embracing still. Nowe second sister wake, J praie (quoth shee) And in your laste nightes dreame come second me. THE SECOND SISTERS dreame. The second sister some what modest bold Reply'd; my dreame partlie by you is told Before you slept, me thought, J heard you saie You in sweete musinge, did a longe tyme laie You musing sigh'd, and sigh'd till sleepe did steale Vppon your mayden eyes, their lidds to seale At length you slept and dreamt you sawe your loue (A dreame indeed, which much vs maydes doe moue) You kiste with him but when he'ed with you lie That made you wake, and out the bedd to flie But soe (me thought) sweet sister did not I For I (me thought) did think it was noe synn To lett a youth betweene my sheetes leape in But yet for fashions sake oft thus J de crye Praye gett you hence, seeke some where els to lye Yet this repulse should still soe faintlie come As it should feircer whett him on for roome For coldlie, to denie loues sweete delight Spurrs to a gallop, the feirce appetite. And sisters well you knowe, we maydes doe hold Those youngmen weake which bunt loues chase but cold What is it to crye, fye, or praye nowe hence? Why to a resolute mynde, that kinde of fence Too open lies: oh! men are desprate foes Vppon advantadge, theile come in, and close, Ide ne're crye, fye awaie, nor vtter this But J would closly hugg to him and kisse. Begone, surcease, y'are rude, forbeare I praie Of tymes such wordes, J've gone aboute to saie But er'e those cruell wordes, could haue their birth Tha'ue smoth'erd bynn, and all has turnd to mirth Wagges well knowe howe, to quench our angers flame Sweete kisses, at first kindling, dampe the same For (sisters) Loue, his schollers this doth teache Wee ioyne should lippes, to seale our lipp's from speach And soe it fard with vs; speachles we laie Giving to pleasures sweetned streame free waie Soe longe (me thought) we dally'd in the bedd As allmost J had lost my maydenhead But (girles) J curse Dreames false deluding guile As I was loosing it, J wakt the while Oh girles! oh girles! who knowes what J did misse, For J awakt, in midst of sweetest blisse Jf euer mayde, toucht Nectar with hir lipp Then J (in dreame) of that sweete iuyce did sipp But oh I wakt! oh then (awakt) my spight For being wakt, a sleepe fell all delight Nowe eldest sister you must wake (quoth shee) Your turne's to tell, the next dreame after me And reason to the eldest sister sayde Else let on me, some for feyture be laide But, J must tell the dreames you haue told twice Unles J should, some fayned dreame devise Were here more then five hundred maydes: yet each Of vs, should in one text and lesson preache For all we maydes doe dreame alike a nights Then to our eyes appeareth pleasing sights And then a smack we taste of loues delights, Oh that Dame Nature, would but heare my sute Then should our mayden bodies, beare noe fruite. Or would it were noe scandall to our liues To haue our pappes giue sucke, er'e marryed wiues: Yf with that pleasing graunt, we maydes were blest Then soner would we yeild to loues requeste For a my fayth girles were it not for feare To be with childe, Id'e ne're denie my Deare Oh then these false dreames fond deluding sightes Weed ne're care for: we'ed taste loues tr'ust delights More then tenn thowsand tymes, Jve thought to pyne This mallenchollie sullen corpes of myne For sild (alas) we maydes can taste sweet loue But our owne bellies, doe the tell-tales proue With sullen puft-vp pride alowde they reade; Proclayming publikelye our private deed Happie are wiues, for they are nere afrayde Of that which terrysyeth moste a maide, They maie haue boyes and girles, and boies agen? They maie with husbandes lie, and other men; Yet nothing noted; but alas poore we Sild dare doe ought, but what the world maie see, Eache thinge, it selfe againste vs doth oppose All thinges are blabbes, our secrets to disclose For sild we reape loues pleasure in the night But envious daie (to'ur shames) bringes it to light Shewing too plaine, at what game we haue beene Making our sweetlie stolen pleasures seene. Oh were it not for dreames, I wonder J Howe we in bedd a nights could brooke to lie But come, lett these things passe; eyther of you Your dreames haue told: my dreame beginneth nowe THE ELDEST SISTERS dreame. Oh (sisters) knowe you, to my ravisht sight My loue with's amber locks appeard laste night Bold boie boldlie hee came as feard of naught, Shewing in what schoole hee his skill was taught Scarce speaking ought at all: yf ought twas this Where's my Gerle? smothring that too with a kisse Nor with this kissing spent hee all the night Tutt (girles) our pastime yeelded more delight I dreamt it did doe soe, for you must knowe J did but onelie dreame, it did doe soe: To loues embracementes, wee (me thought) fell then But loues sweete game is coldlie chaste by men. Yet our sex, workes loues labor, eu'rye daie With mindes, as willing, as men goe to plaie J girles J girles, J speakt in heate of bloude Men too too soone are ty'rd, with doying good But oh deare girlis (such is our sexes kind) One man maie please vs all, except our mind For yf one man content one woman cann Then, why should it not be this youthfull man? His vaines were full, soe stronge a backhee had As Herculis to him was but a ladd Yf youth and strength 'tis, quencheth womans fire Then 'twas in him, as much as Jde desire But 'tis not Oceans of that liquid stuff Which lyes in youthfulst men that is enough To quench the mindes outragious frying flame; For that once ty'nd age onely dampes the same Manie a woman' till shee hath tr'yd twoo Distasteth all, hir firste sweetehart doth doe From whence praie comss that Luste, that sowre-sweet smart? Oh th' ead of that same springes, a divelish harte. But whether from my text am J uowe fled My dreame was this, J loste my maydenhead To that let me retourne: oh tis delight Unto vs maides, to think but on that night. Him t'weene my armes one while J did infold Another while, he me, 'tweene his would hold. Entwindinge leggs (me thought) with me he laie While J, withs curled locks, did sporte and plaie Soe longe plaide we as sisters well J wisse Our sportes extended further then to kisse Soe longe J kiste, soe longe on's looks J fedd As sure in dreame I loste my maydenhead. But (sisters) was it in my pow're to choose Then such a losse J d'e eu'ry mynute loose For when we maydes doe lose our mayden treasure Oh by that losse we wynn a world of pleasure Fayth Girles, Maydes cannot think what sweet delight Two louers take which warr in loues feirce fight: To them loath som's the daie, ouer the night But nowe I sighe, nowe doe I greiue to thinke That, that night my eye-lides did euer wynke For when J wakt (oh dreames! oh dreames y'are theeues And mist my loue, Judge then (girles) of my greeues Oh had J had tenn worldes J would haue than Gev'n all those worldes (sweete girles) for halfs a man Men stuffs their chestes as full as they can hold With cramb'd-trust bagges of aungell-winged gold: But what to doe? for sooth to by this land: Oh would I had that dust of Tagus strand Ide not buy land or howses with it: J For other merchandize Jde make it flie: Had J such laden truncks this Ide doe than For enry night ith' yeare Ide buy a man For, sisters, J maie speake to you my mind When J awakt, and lookt my loue to find Feeling for's neck to claspe that neck of his For's ruddy lipp, hoping that lipp to kisse For's wanton legg, for myne with that t'yntwind And sisters for ? oh girles you knowe my mind When for these louelie thinges I searcht to see But could not find, where those sweet things might be With bitter passion, I burst out and cryd Wishinge, with in my mothers wombe Jd'e dy'd Oh sisters! oh sweete sisters, then did I Wishe, fatall Death attache me instauntlie. Nowe did J stare aboute; nowe did I call But when noe aunswere J could heare at all Up in my smock J rose and searcht each place (Oh girles extreames our sex in loues sweete case) Groping behind eache trunck, feeling vnder bedd Me thought for him which had my maydenhead And oft Ide crye sweete wagg, thy selfe disclose For Jv'e another maydenhead to loose But when noe answere J could heare, oh then Weeping, I sigh'd and went to bedd agen Wher'e one while tumbling that waie; other this: Nowe should I sighe; nowe my poore pillowe kisse Entwinding it betweene my armes embrace Jde hugg't as yf my deare duck were in place Fayning (in that my frying passions flame) I hottlie chaste loues sweetst, delightfull game But when J found my sence deluded soe My passions heate, to coldnes then did growe For myssing him J grewe more cold then stone; Oh't paynes my heart to telt; come lett's be gone.

Tell him, e're thou mettst with him hee did lacke Shoes for's feete, hose for's leggs, and cloathes for's back Such peales at all tymes ring thou in his eare Jt is my sentence; doo't, and doe not feare To doe that hest, awaie did Crona trudge Praising dame Will, for a moste vpright Iudge. The younge vvifes complaint against hir ieolous headed old husband. That wrinckle-faced drudge, noe sooner gone But in hir place straight flept-vp such a one As matchles was in bewties pleasing grace; One, who exceld, loues mother in the face Men call hir Youtha: oh greate queene quoth shee Since woemens wronges thou rightst', then right thou mee My couetous parents (not to Natures kinde) Unto an old man matcht me, 'gainste my minde Fortie such men, vnable are to quenche The firye flames tyn'd in a lustfull wenche. When burning Luste with's violent scortching fire Hath sing'd my harte with passions feirce desire Then in Loues chase J hunt, for in Loues game Remayneth that which quencheth Lusts hott flame. But, tweene an old mans armes what's there to quench? Still flares the flames, ty'nd in a youthfull wench. Yet yf that shiu'ring coldnes heate allaies; Then that in old men, shall we find alwaies As we are extreame hott, soe still are they Extreame in that same cold extremytee But loues feirce fire with fire must quenched be; 'Ells still the more it burnes: so't fares with me. For 'las, when lust hath heate me, I cann find His cold embrace, noe quencher of my mind My parents might haue matcht me to one dead, As well as to a sapples old mans bedd: J cann smale diffrence make: for men one old Like dead men laye: oh th'are corruptly cold. Rug'd-wrinckled is his face: his head in showe Seemes like a hillock, hild with milk white snowe His humors heauier, then sadd massie lead His leggs like Jsicles doe warme my bedd Noe signe of heate, is in this aged sire âLes in his nose, but that resembles fire. What shall J saie, ther'es none, that doth him see But saies the picture of cold winte'rs he Yet J (oh moste vnequall matche!) alas Enforste to wedd, with this cold dotard was With whom (greate Queene) I such a life doe leade As J eache mynute, wishe my selfe were dead. Soe hath his aged disabillitie Possessed him, with this feende Ieolosie As J cann noe waies, goe from sight ofs' eyes But straite waies after me, he sendes his spies Nor cann I talke with anie, but in's head A riseth some conceipte, Il'e wrong his bedd. Let but a trech'rous doore in night once creake Then straight he doubtes, ther'es some with me would speake Confrence with neerest knin, heel not allowe. Fearing we plott, to breake our weddlock vowe Which god he knowes (greate Queene) my spottles mind That waies as yet, hath neuer beene inclynd Smyle I, or weepe J, all is one; for hee Of wha't soe e're J doe, will ieolous bee Jf I doe smyle, then sayes he straight Iv'e had Sport with my loue; tis that, makes me soe gladd If J am sadd; then doth hee saie hee knowes The spring from whence my mallanchollie flowes Up braydinge me, J'me onelie sadd for this Because my loue, of his sett how're did misse Such is a grislie old mans, faire wiues 'state As ieolous-headed he will deeme she'el hav't Though ouer hir hee setts a thousand spies, And eu'rye spie, an Argus is, for's eyes: Therefore, since (causles) he doth wrong me soe Teache me revenge against this loathed foe. Giue sentence (Queene) what shall bee done by me Againste him in reuenge ofs' ieolosee. Dame VVills sentence in the young wifes behalf against hir old husband. Youth a quoth maddam Will, with greate reguard Haue J, this thy sadd information heard And doe bewaile the same; but Jle' haue thee Plague thy old husband, for his Jeolosee. Yet Ieolous-headed men noe plagues doe neede For in themselues, sufficient plagues doe breede For looke in what place, Jealosie doth dwell There are the tormentes, of an earthlie hell. Yet since for naught, he doubts soe faire a dame Thus shalt thou sting and torture him, forth'same. Jn secrett wise, Jle haue thee staine his bedd, And graft faire guilded hornes, on's silverd head Such glorious spriggs soe well in noe place growes As in the riv'led furrowes of an old mans browes. Thou art a woman, therefore canst not want At all tymes skill, such setts and grafts, to plant My sentence is thou shalt him soe beguild As make him thinke his father to that child Which thou thy selfe knowst not who it begott To gather goodes for whom, shall th'old drudg trott Not sparing night nor daie, till's life be done Howe to scrape wealth, to giue anothers sonn And cause thy parents, forste thee to his bedd Thus will J haue thy parents punnished. Thou shalt, vnto theire skarlet blushing shame, Besport them with the spotts, of thy staind name Soyling thy wedding sheetes, faire J'vry white With fowle black spotts, of salt lusts loathd delight Bewteous youtha my sentence nowe is done See that on them the'res execution. The gossipping vviues complaint against hir riche churlishe husband. This sentence giv'n, the whole route'gann to rise But pert quicke-tongued Gossippa (whose eyes Contaynd of beymishe teares a cristall fluude) Starts-vpp, and praies Dame Will, to hir be good. Of all thy louing subiectes J (quoth shee) Haue euer yet beene found faythfulst to thee And therefore my good Queene, let me acquainte Thy gentle eares with one petition plainte. Two thinges I loue; two vsuall thinges they are The firste, newe-fashiond cloathes, J loue to weare Newe tires, newe ruffes; J, and newe gesture too: Jn all newe fashions, J doe loue to goe: The second thing J loue, is this J weene To ride aboute to haue those newe cloat hes seene At eu'rye gossipping I am at still And euer wilbe, maie J haue my will For at ons owne howse, praie, who ist' cann see Howe fyne in newe found, fash'ond tires wee bee? Unles our husbandes; faithe; but verye fewe And whoo'd goe gaie, to please a husbands veiwe? Alas we wiues doe take but smale delight Yf none (besides our husbandes) se'es that sight. It ioyes our heartes, to heare an other man Praise this or that attire, that wee weare on Wee iocond are, and thinke our selues much graste Yf we heare one saie, faire wenche, faithe in waste This straight-girt gowne, becomes you passing well From other Taylors, yours doe beare the bell: Oh hee that well cann actt-out such sweete partes Throwes-vp the lure which wynns our verye hartes When we are stubborn'st, then let men with skill Rubb'es well with th'oyle of praise and bend we will That smoothe-fyne supple oyle doth soften vs soe As what ist then we will not yeild vnto? Meetinges and brauerye were my delight: Those were the two: but (greate queene) he'res the spight Without greate store of wealth, be dailie gainde Of all delightes, those are the worste maintaind And therefore I did alwaies plott in mind Howe a wealthie, riche husband, out to find And one J've gott: but such a churle is hee As scarce a penny will bestowe on mee And that shall neuer come, but (fore, J ha'te) The miserable clowne, will scratch his pate Alwayes demaundinge what with't, J will doe And then comes out, her'es such a stir with you. A man had better ridd-be of his life Then clog'd with such a fydling foolish wife Such are his tauntes, when J demaund him ought As what I gett from him is dearelie bought. I cannot grosslie feede, for J in sooth Haue a tender mawe, and a daintie tooth These beeues and muttons, are but homelie fare My appetite doth thirste-for what's most rare: Had J vnto my mind, then J would eate Still of the fynest pallat-pleasing meate But fye on hogges! oh! there is none liues, liues Soe straunglie hatefull as these rich churles wives For yf J cannot gnawe, a hard drye cruste Manie a daie, faste-out the tyme I muste. Juste like to Tantalus i fares with mee For what J hunger-for J alwaies see. All what against him Jd'e to saie, Ive saide Nowe queene J doe ymplore thy counsells ayde. J cannot gossipp it nor cann goe trymm Cause J want arte, to worke coine out from him. Tatling Gossippa here-at holdes hir tongue With praying maddam Will to right hir wronge. Silence beinge made, thus dame Will replies. VVills sentence vppon the rich churle Svbiect quoth shee I've heard thy Jniuries And yf they all bee true which J did beare Then are they too too much for thee to beare For to vs women these thinges are moste Jll T'abate our prides, and to restraine our will If hee bee riche; his barnes are full of graine Where hee one bushell sells, sell thou still twaine His swyne, sheepe, geese, henns, ducks, doe thou convaie J, sell his very shirtes but goe thou gaie, Of all men, hee vnworthy'st is of life That will not laste of all mistruste his wife. A nightes, faile not but pick the churles stuft purse Yf hee doth sware, I hope thy tongue cann curse But yf his barnes, purse, yarde, and all doe fayle Then to th'old vse put thou thy nimble tayle Lett that worke for thee; for by that same waie Ther'es man e a woman makes hir selfe gaie That waie thou maiste the supple sattins ware That waie thou maiste feede on thee dainty'st fare Yf noe waie else thou canste make thy selfe trymm Then that waie, tis my will, thou punnish him. Whoo'd sweate and toyle for this same golden treasure When one maie gett it, with the sweetest pleasure Thou knowst my minde; Gossippa, doe it then: Faire wenches cannot want, while there are men. Diogynes makes himself knowne. At th'end of which fame sentence, all arose Where-at my selfe to them I did disclose But er'e I did it, I did gett to'oth dore For had they caught me, they'd haue vsd me sore: To hold me, eu'rye woman out did crie But bring out theire reache awaie rann I: Gladd that Id'e seene and heard theire knauerye Nowe sir, Ive iustlie told, for what intent I like a woman amongst women went Yf you on theire behalfes haue ought to saie Sait'e some where else, or gett you hence awaie. Allexander. To what thast' saide, smale creditt I cann giue For I shall neuer made-be to beleeue That creatures halfe devine for glorious bewtie Should soe respectles be to man in dutie. Thinges eu'rye waie soe perfect faire in showe In virtues fullie perfect, are I knowe Diogynes. Thou knowst it; doost? awaie, thou art an elfe What canst thou knowe, that knowest not thy selfe The golden-skaled snake's, a louelie thinge Had not that glorious worme, a poysned stinge Of maides and wiues noe barrell better bee Would God made none, but what were'spoke of mee. Allexander. Why prithee speake; howe manie wouldst haue then? Diogines. For one halfe girle, tenn hundred thowsand men. Allexander. Nowe fie vppon thee Cynnick, why dost bite And sett soe pure a thing, as woman light? I am a shamd' of thee; doe what I can, I cannot think, thou art a perfect man I doe beleeue that thou at noe tyme haste That manlie heate, which causeth man to waste Thou art noe man; for we'rt a man. I'me sure A womans companie thou couldst endure. But saie, thou wert en forst vppon thy life To take thee to some one to be thy wife What kinde of woman-creature wouldst thou chuse Yf it were soe thou mighst' it not refuse. Diogynes. By hanginge, Ide chuse rather end my life Then Id'e a woman haue, to be my wife But were it soe, that one I needes must haue And that I had noe waie, my selfe to saue Then all the world Ide' seeke, but I would fynd A woman for my wife, dumb, deafe, and blinde Besides; yf I could possiblie prevaile Ide seeke the world for one, without a taile Most men in bodie wasted are by wiues But such I'me sure, would proue restoritiues. Allexander. Fie man; why what in women doost thou see That they soe much, distastefull are to thee. Diogynes. Noe more then thou maiste see, yf th'art not blind Why moste of them hudge gyantes are for minde Pride keepes hir faire in eache faire wantons face And Luste keepes in theire tayles, hir markett place Revengefull Wrath theire furious tongues doth swaie. From labor, drowsie Sloath their handes doth staie In syns sweete-poysned Iuyce drunken theile be And Envie others, drunken soe to see What see I not in them? they are the Inns Wherein doth lodge those monstrous murdring synns. Allexander. Fie Cynnick, thou doste blowe too bitter aire On tender blossoms, which are sweetlie faire. Diogynes. Yf shee be faire, and a sharpe-witted one And honeste too; a Phenix she'es alone. Who hath tenn Herculesses strengths in's loines And with a faire sharpe-witted wanton Ioyns Shall be assurd the horne, on's browe to fynd: Whoo'l quench a wantons luste must quench the mind; Th'are proude; eache wench would bee an Allexander And by hir will, ouer a world commaunder. But yf not proude, nor lustfullie inclind Then eyther foole, or scold, of hir shalt fynd. Eyther of them, mans patience soe would alter As they would make him straight make vse ath halter, They are all naught, I cannot brooke em I Allexander. Naie fie Cynnick thou railst too gennerall Thou muste not for some fewe condemn em all, Thou talkst, as yf thou wert noe womans sonn I would th'adst trauaild, but as I haue done: Although th' Athenians givn are to theire will And liue a life displeasinge (hatefull ill) Yet since my travaile, (whereas I haue beene) Aboundance vertuous women I haue seene. Diogynes. Oh ya'r a trauaylier; praie are you soe? Where you haue beene, black swanns you haue seene too Good trauayler the hearinge I will giue you But you shall giue me leaue not to beleeue you Women are naughte: Il'e talk noe more with thee And therefore naught, because women they bee. Allexander. Oh straung! yf Allexander heard but thee For womens sakes (I'me sure) thou'dst punnisht be. Diogynes. Goe telt' him goe; I doe as little care For him as thee; let both doe what you dare. Tell me of him? I feare him not a flie: I dread not might: Diogynes am I: Hees but a man; Il'e ne're fawne for mans grace What I haue saide, Il'e boldlie saye too's face And wer't, he were as badd as women bee Id'e bite the monnark to his face, shouldst see. Allexander. He knowes thou wouldst in that I knowe the same For I am hee: for this cause here I came To heare thy wittie bluntnes, and to see Whether thy sayings and thy deedes agree, Come Cynnick burne this tubb and followe me And vnto noble titles, Ile raise thee. Diogynes. Thou wilt: but I will not: none can raise me; I'me in my tubb as greate a Kinge as thee. Who holdes the world and it's vaine trash for slight He truelie conquers it, giue him his right: And soe doe I: therefore hudge Allexander I hold my selfe (ath twaine) the greatst commaunder I will not begg to rule and governe landes Onelle thy absence, Ile begg at thy handes. I prethee pack thee hence and gett thee gone The companie still is best, where is but one. Goe seeke thee out an other world to wynn And putt the women of this world therein But let that world be farr enough; and then Learning and virtue will encrease with men Naught else I haue to begg, graunt but this suite Then henceforth euer, shall my tongue rest mute. FINIS. You choyceste creatures, (you which god did take From-out mans selfmans comforter to make) Discomfort not your selues nor be dismayd At what a dogged Cynnick here hath sayde What though sowre-churlishe-he (too currish blynde) Hath barkt too broadlye gainste your gentle kind Yet little doth such clouds keepe from our sights Your shynninge virtues; this worldes splendanntst lights: Happlye his gally vennym'd speech proceeds As grounded by self-doyinge divelishe deedes. Dead is the dogg, J hope and for your sex The spirritts doth his spirritt hottlye vex. Excuse my worke, it paintes the Cynnick forth And to the wise it nothinge staines your worth. FINIS. A MORRALL SATIRE, Jntituled the Owles araygnement. When fowles could talke with reason like to men This accydent amongst em happend then: Before the Prince of fowles the Owle was brought To aunswere why she did things lawles naught: Her adversaries were the batt the thrush With others moe: who night'lie in the bush Shee ey her scard with skreeking fearefull cryes Or sodeynlie (ere wake) did them surprize: Wherefore they apprehending hir did craue That they against hir migh: iuste Iustice haue. Greate Prince quoth they to death put thou this Owle She is a vildlie living wicked fowle: Unfitt to liue: all daie shee sleepes; a nightes Smale birds shee kills; the best and greatst she frights Breaking our quiet sleepe with the fell noyse Of manlike lure and yauling-whooping voice And therefore sou'raigne Prince wee all doe craue Since shee deserveth death, death she maie haue. The Eagle sternlie mild putt them a side Commaunding silens thus the Eagle cryd Come forward Owle and free thy hart from feare Speake freelie bird true iustice J doe here Before my sword of iustice Death doth strike Th'accuser, and th'accusd J heare alike Bribes nor affection maks my cleare eys blind And therefore freelie feareles speak thy mind When th'owle did heare this mild speach of hir Lord Couradg shee tooke in gesture and in word Ch?aring hir selfe, shee thus tooth Eagle cryes Jmpartiall iustice comes from Maiesties And since your highnes doth thus daint to heare: My cause your selfe; my cause J little feare For what need J quoth shee dread anie thing. Being my cause is heard before my King. Let murdrers quake when Iustice shakes hirradd The Just nere feares the Judgment of Just god Noe more will J since freelie plead J must (Jn guileles cause) before a King soe iust Two accusations are against me layde To be a murdrer is the first J'me sayde The second is that J in sylent night With manlike voice smale birds and fowles afright Greate Prince I both confes; but firste Jle showe The cause and reason which makes meskreek soe A nightes I hollowing whoop and wondring crye But gratious Prince this is the reason why In eache place I doe see proude Babells built With cloude-braving turretts daubd-o're with gust With in those Babells J doe peepe to spie The princelie presence of your maiestie But when in steed of you (on bedd of strawe) I see that tatling bird, the Iack-adawe With admiration then awaie I flie Then lo ho ho then wo ho ho crye I. Sometimes J daringlie presume to peepe With in your Court when all your courtyers sleepe Where when I see the prating parratt grac'd And birdes of better worth for him displac'd Or when J see the plumy peacocks pride To striue to lie by's sou'raigne Princes side And se the valiant Cock with swaines to liue That sight much wonder to my eyes doth giue With admiration then awaie I flie Then lo ho ho then wo ho ho crie I Sometimes I flie ore Neptunes glassie soile To veiwe the slipps of our sen-girtt-in Jle But what J see howe nakedlie they bee Howe like they are tooth winter-shaken tree And howe from them all braue sea birds are fledd Then like a malecontent J hang downe head With admiration then awaie J flie Then lo ho ho then wo ho ho crie I Sometimes ore sto'nd-paud Citties J take flight Where to my night-cleard eyes admired sight I see the Cuccoe build in house his neaste Which ere was Wont to be Silvanus gueste: Baselie brooking each cock-sparrowes rivalrye Suffrings mate for trash to bath in brothelry A nights such sights presented to my eye Makes me with wonder wo ho ho to cry. This is the cause greate Prince why in the night I wonder soe: nowe where they doe indight Me for a murtherer: your grace shall find J'me leaste of all your nobles soe inclind; Guitles J plead; or yf J guiltie be With me must die your whole nobility Your Hawkes (dread souraigne Prince) doe dailie kill And dailie doe devoure eate-vp and spill Your honest subiects, yet theres not a aint Laies hold of them'gainst them the'res noe complaint Greate-peares nere to Princes should not doe soe By their stepps we track which waie Kings doe goe As Phebes light from Phebus doth proceed Soe doth a great Lords act frome Princes deed Yf Kings encloud with vice their Uirtues sunn That selfe thick-foggye course their peeres will runn Jf I doe murther, they doe murther too What waie J goe, that waie your banks must goe Else gratious Prince your lawe giues waye and place To such as are, or are not in your grace. Else greate ones open maie your mercyes doore Sucking the fatt from men but meanlie poore Iniustly wronging poore-poore vnderlings For pettie crymes: when vnder your owne wings Far fowler ects within themselues they nurrish And consciensles the vildest dambd things cherrish But soe it should not be my souraigne King For from a Kingdoms lawes cleere christ all spring Alike all streames should runn: I eu'ry where That should spoute water vncorruptlie cleare Let it doe soe my Prince: let poore mans cryme Be iudgd like theires: w' are made of self-like slime All kings are earthlie gods; therefore should Kings Jn an impartiall ballance weigh all thinges The iustest iudge doth soe; and soe should you Like that corruptles iudg in all pointes doe. I freelie speake; the cause I speake soe free Is' cause at first great Prince you licensd mee. J haue accusd, but not excusd; for still My faults not lessond for anothers ill. Therefore my Prince to this my pleadings tend You'l quitt my fault, and Jle my fault amend. The Prince well listning to th'appeaching Owle Turnes to the hawkes, on whom with wrathfull scowl He fixt his eyes. Quoth he, speake is it true My nobles which this owle reports of you? Jn guiltles bloud haue you embrud your hands? T'is monstrous vilde! why your the propps of lands The steres-men to your Prince: by you hees lede By whom but you should he be counselled? Your heades should conduicts be: cleare cristall springs From which should powre al wholsom virtuous things From your braines fountaines such pure streames should flowe As by that moysture things should florishing growe, Wherefore enact J lawe: with your consent? J thinke so punish vice was our intent: Will you that are parte-makers of the lawe Be breakers of it first? How then in awe Shall J my subiects haue? why when they se You drown'd in vice they 'le deeme the like of me Disgracefullie then this they will report Howe theirs an extreame famin grown at court; Of virtuous men theres such a famin grown As scarcelie one about the Court is knowne By you shall I growe to loathd infamie And iudgd the nurse of fowle-fell tyranny And therfore nobles yf your free and cleare From these dambd haynos crimes, makt now appeare. Silence being made, the guiltie nobles Seing themselues to growe to dangrous trobles Thus (despratly) replies: oh King quoth they J hope vnto our murthers youl giue waie Yf we make spoile and other birds vndoe We take the xsample souraign Prince from you We nerest Princes Jmitate them still We be the emblems of your good or Jll Yf you slaie, we slaie; yf you saue, we saue All Kings about them manie shadowes haue: For this our fault we seeke not make excuse Cause from your selfe sprang firste this faults abuse And therefore King yf you'l haue subiects awe You must not onelie make but keep your lawe. This peremptorye aunswere so incenst His maiestie as twene them wars comenst But while as they were soe at Civill strife The Owle that malefactour saues hir life She being loose awaie from keeper scudds Lusking from sight all daie in thickest woods But eu'ry night about the outlawe flies Joying hir escape; wo ho ho she cryes.
