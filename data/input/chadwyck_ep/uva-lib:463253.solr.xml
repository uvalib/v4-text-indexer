TO THE RIGHT NOBLE AND VERTVOVS LADY, LVCY, COVNTESSE OF BEDFORD, MY MOST HONOVRED Lady and Mistresse. To the Translator. Had Lucan hid the truth to please the time, He had beene too vnworthy of thy Penne: Who neuer sought, nor euer car'd to clime By flattery, or seeking worthlesse men. For this thou hast been bruis'd: but yet those scarres Do beautifie no lesse, then those wounds do Receiu'd in iust, and in religious warres; Though thou hast bled by both, and bearst them too. Change not, to change thy fortune tis too late. Who with a manly faith resolues to dye, May promise to himselfe a lasting state, Though not so great, yet free from infamy. Such was thy Lucan, whom so to translate Nature thy Muse (like Lvcans) did create W. R. To the Translator. Homer and Maro, that did Poetize, As much in matter, as in kinde of stile, Did thereby dimme the glorious deeds the while Of them, whose acts they meant to memorize. So did not Lvcan, who (in other guize) The gests of two great Worthies did compile; S'deining their high atchieuements to defile, Or inter-lace with idle vanities. Therefore how farre from Fable Truth is set, So farre aboue all feigners Lvcan shines; While in his Muse both faculties are met, That with sweet Number beauteous Truth combines. And we to thee in endlesse debt must dwell For making Lucan speake our tongue so well. S. S. To the Translator. As Thetis famous sonne concealed lay From that braue Troope of Greekish martiall Knights, Vntill Vlysses (quicker ey'd then thay) Presented him vnmask't to Trojan fights. So Lucans Spaine-borne, Rome-bred, Muse-nurc't wit, Lay hid in lines obscure to most of vs, Till thou (Vlysses-like) with numbers fit Didst happily vnclowd his Genius. And though for it that Ithac bostingly Claim'd to himselfe Achilles acts of fame; Thou (worthy Knight) dost vse more modesty: Although thy worke alike deserues the same. For who with iudgement reades thy well-tun'd Layes, Will iudge thee worthy Lucans Crowne of Bayes. A. I. To the Translator. Lvcan, that first in the Imperiall tongue (In naked truth of acted history) The ciuill wounds made for an Empire song; Hath checkt precedent, taught succeeding Poesy, That flatteries and fictions may delight, May please a Tyrant, wrong a rightfull King, May please an Orphan Iudgment, wrong the right, Enuelop Truth, proclaime an vntrue thing. Lucan, that first hath showne the force of verse, Relating onely what was seene, felt, donne, Of Conqu'rors triumphs, of the Conqu'reds herse, All as it left, all as it first begunne. Not like the Trojan Theamers, fit for schooles, Fabling of this and that in Heauen, Earth, Hell, Sober to mad-men, turning wise to fooles, Gods to be Neat-heards, men in starres to dwell, Hath match't the faith, that History requires: Hath match't best History in choyce of phrase: Hath taught, that History in nought aspires Aboue the truth of deeds, it selfe to raise. This Lucan for his truth a Truch-man gaines As true to him, as he to Truth remaines. T. W. LVCANS PHARSALIA. The first Booke. The Argvment VVhat motiues did this warre incense, Cæsars and Pompeys insolence. Forbidden Rubicon is past, Aryminum surpris'd in haste. Tribunes disgrac'd from Rome retire: They Cæsars heart doe set on fire. To warres his Legions he exhorts, And calles from farre his old Cohorts. The wofull Citties mazed plight, With Pompeys base vntimely flight. A stowt Decree the Senate make, And then for feare doe Rome forsake. Lastly, prodigious signes are seene, And what the Augures answers beene. A more then ciuill warre I sing, That through th' Emathian fields did ring, Where reins let loose to head-strong pride, A potent people did misguide: Whose conquering hand enrag'd rebounds On his owne bowels with deepe wounds. Where Hosts confronting neare alies, All faith and Empires Lawes defies. A world of force in faction meetes, And common guilt like torrents fleets. Where like infestuous ensignes waue, The Ægle doth the Ægle braue, And Pyle against the Pyle doth raue. A sharpe reprehension of Ciuill warre.Deare Cittizens, what brainsick charmes? What outrage of disordered armes? Leades you to feast your enuious foes, To see you goar'd with your owne blowes? Proud Babylon your force doth scorne, Whose spoyles your trophies might adorne, And Crassus vnreuenged ghost, Roames wayling through the Parthian coast. Doth now your hearts such warre desire, As yeelds no triumphs for your hyre? O what a world by Lands and Seas, Mought you haue won with much more ease. Then halfe the bloud your weapons draines, In ciuill strife from out your vaines! As farre as Phœbus first doth rise, Vntill in Thætis lap he lies: Or where his parching golde-beam'd ray, Doth dart downe flames at mid of day: Or frostie Hyems shiuering stands, Glazing the Sea with ycie hands; Whose ayre benum'd with Scythian flawes, No Summers sunne-shine euer thawes: The Seres, and Araxes rude, Not to our Empire yet subdued; Or what Barbarians else are bred, About old Nylus vnknowne head; All these might you haue vanquished. And then, O Rome, when thou hadst hent The whole worlds homage to thy bent, And plaid at full this mastering prise, If Enuies spleene thee then agrize, Against thy selfe, thy selfe oppose, For yet thou want'st no forraine foes: But Italy lies now aspoile, Her Citties leuelld with the soile. Their loftie walles with breaches torne, The miserable estate of Italy. The vacant houses all forlorne. The Markets vnfrequented beene, The vntrod streets ore-growne with greene: The fruitfull faire Hesperian fields, That nothing now but thistles yeilds, Cries out for hands to plow and plant, Her labourers are growne so scant. This dismall state wherein she stands, Proceedes not from fierce Pyrrhus hands; Nor yet could Hannibals despight Inflict on vs this wretched plight. No forraine foes could so preuaile, The Romans themselues worke their owne ruine. Our setled state to rent and quaile: Th' audacious sword worne by thy side, Hath hewen in thee these gashes wide. And yet if Fates haue so decreed, That thou (O Nero) shouldst succeed By these meanes to the Empires throne, Our fore-past armes the lesse we moane. For Iupiter was not possest Of heauens sole rule in setled rest, Before the Gyants were supprest. Let then Pharsalia fields be spread With yron legions scorning dread. So to appease the whining mood Of Punique Ghosts with Latium blood. Let Munda be the fatall place Where Cæsar quailes great Pompeys race: And let as hard a siege betide As earst Mutina did abide. Yea let as great a famine flow As euer did Perusia know: And two such Fleetes confronting rage, As did the Axium battell wage: With as much broyle and hammering dinne, As when that Vulcan did beginne To set his Cyclops to their taskes; It should seem that this was written in the beginning of Neroes reigne, w?? was most excell?tly gouerned for the first 5 yeares, with singular Iustice &amp; temperance.Whose sparkling forges Ætna maskes. And yet thou Rome shalt be in debt Vnto these wrackes, that did beget This happy peace, wherein we liue, And to our toyles an end did giue. But when (O Nero) Atrops knife Shall shred in twaine thy time of life: And thou (vnto the starres bequeau'd) With Heauens ioy shalt be receiu'd. There shalt thou freely take thy choyce, Whether thy humor more reioyce To sit in the Empiring Throne, As ruling ouer all alone: Or whether thou doe more desire To sway the Carre of Phœbus fire, And thence (with wandring flames) suruay The earth in all her rich array: Whom thy milde beames will not dismay. The Deities bend to thy hest, And Nature yeelds thee thy request, To be what God-head likes thee best, And where thy Empires seate shall rest. This is meere Ironicall flattery.But I beseech thee of high grace, Doe not thy Soueraigne Mansion place About the North or Southerne starre, Which is from vs remote so farre: For then should Rome fall to mischance, If thou on her looke but a scance. But if a part of heauens huge sphere, Thou choose thy ponderous heft to beare; O let the Axle-tree sustaine In this he teacheth Nero how he should gouerne, by an Imagination of what is.The paise of thy Maiesticke traine. Amidst the firmament be plac'd, For that with brightest beames is grac'd. So Neroes shine shall still subsist, Neuer obscur'd with cloudy mist. Then shall men lay aside their Armes, And rue the shame of ciuill harmes. All Nations then shall be at peace With mutuall leagues, and Trades increase. So when all iarres doe end their dates, Ianus may sparre his Iron gates. But whilst that I some power Diuine Inuoke, to strength this Muse of mine: If I thy fauour can obtaine (O Nero) to assist my vaine; I will not then desire or craue, Apollo's furtherance to haue; Nor yet intreat the God of wine, To aid this Tragicke worke of mine: For thou alone canst life infuse And spirit to my Latine muse. My minde giues me the cause to write, That did this humorous rage incite: A taske that will much labour cost, To shew what franticke feuers tost This peoples moode, to raue in spoyle, And banish peace from Latium soyle. It was conspiring Destiny, The causes of the ciuill war. The bane of all felicity: And that which is by heauenly reed, As doome to greatnesse still decreed, Not long to stand in setled state: But, being too much eleuate, The owne paize must it ruinate: And Rome her selfe, too powrfull growne, With insolence was ouer-throwne. So when by great resistlesse Fate, The world dissolues to her last date, Returning to that formlesse masse, Which was before ought formed was: Starres shall with starres confusedly, In clusters meet within the skye: The fiery Element displac't, Shall downe into the deepe be cast: The massy globe in this disease, Denie due bounds vnto the seas: Belphœbe will runne counter quite To Titan, that doth lend her light: And (scorning her owne oblique way) Would guide the Lanthorne of the day. So that the course of this vaste All, Into confusions lappe will fall. For Ioue to great things this doome left, They should be crusht with their owne heft. Fortune most triumphes ouer great estates. Fortune doth scorne to cast a frowne On those, that meane estate keepes downe: But enuies those that lofty stand, Empiring ouer sea and land. O Rome! then bondage pressed thee, When thou wert first made slaue to three. Diuided kingdomes staggring stand, One Scepter fits one soueraigne hand. O yee contentious Roman knights, Whom blinde Ambition so incites! What solace yeelds that Soueraignty That's gain'd with such hostility As doth your hands and hearts diuide, And turmoiles all the world beside? But otherwise it neuer sorts: For whilst the land the seas supports; Or that the Aire (in heats and colds) The Earth in her soft mantle folds: And Phœbus shall maintaine his race, Or Cinthia supply his place, So long Competitors of States No faith amongst Competitors of kingdomes.(In iealousie) shall cloke debates. Faith holds not firme twixt crowned Mates. We need not farre examples seeke, What other clymate breedes the like: For when Rome first her walles ordain'd, Romulus and Rhemus.With brothers blood they were distain'd. Yet all the whole worlds worth, that time, Could not requite so foule a crime. A petty structure (scarce begun) Hath this fraternall outrage spun. Our two great Chiefetaines (for a space) A iarring concord did embrace. And so an outward peace maintain'd, Which their ambitious hopes disdain'd. But Crassus power doth interpose, Crassus the meanes that kept Cæsar and Pompey within their bounds. And hold them off from fatall blowes. Like Istmos, that diuided keepes The raging concurse of the deepes, And doth so strongly part the waues, That each with other neuer raues. But if this Istmos breake asunder, How would th' Ægean billowes thunder, Incountering the Ionian seas, And struggle with their counterpaise? So Crassus whilst he was a life, Held these two worthies off from strife; And (with perswasiue powerfull words) Within their sheathes confin'd their swords. But when the haplesse Carran fight, Brought Crassus to his latest night, This Parthian blow dissolu'd the Chaine By Crassus death this ciuill rage brake out. That did these head-strong Peeres restraine; And bred more scath vnto our state Then it was ware (by home-debate:) For now the Roman Lordly guides Diuide themselues in factious sides: And our great fortune, that had long Subsisted by a people strong, What mischiefe two ambitious mindes can breed in a quiet state. That conquered worlds on seas and maine, Could not two haughty mindes containe: For Iulia (with like cruell fate Vntimely brought vnto her date, By Atrops life-destroying hands) Dissolu'd the neere-allianc'd bands Betwixt her father, and her spouse, Forgetting their contracted vowes. Ivlia the means to hold Cæsar &amp; Pompey in good correspondency. Whereas if Iulias line of life Had longer scap't the fatall knife; Euen she had beene of power alone, Betwixt them two to make attone, And from insulting force to cease, With ioyning armed hands in peace; As did the Sabines daughters earst, Who sweetly all dislikes dispearst Betwixt their Fathers and their Pheeres: But by thy death these pride-swolne Peeres, Shake off all leagues, and straine to warres, Where vertue emulates it iarres. Pompeyes iealousie.For thou great Pompey dost suspect, That new-raisd triumphes thine deiect, And that thy Pyrate-Laurell falles Short of the conquest of the Gaules. Thus the remembrance of thy deeds, In thee so great impatience breeds, As that thou holdst it fowle disgrace Except thou runne a matchlesse race, None now endures a second place. P?peys humor. For Pompey will no equall haue, Cæsars humor. Nor supreme Lord must Cæsar braue. Heynous it was, but to be scand, Which of them in the right did stand: And tooke vp Armes with iust pretence, Great Iudges doe with both dispence. The conquering part the Gods avowes, Cato the vanquished allowes: Th' ambition of these captaines tends Not to the like and selfe-same ends. Pompeyes disposition described. Pompey (surpris'd with elder yeares) His course in quiet glory steeres. And (keeping state in peacefull gowne) Followes not Mart for more renowne. He dotes vpon domesticke fame, And so (to glorifie his name) To State-affaires doth frame his bent. And then (to giue the world content) With largesse plyes the common Rowt, And, on the Theaters, sets out Popular affectation.His great exployts, and seruice done Till through the peoples eares it runne, Suffis'd when their applause is wonne. No new imployments he requests; But on his fore-past fortunes rests. So Pompeyes name is like a shade, That by a stately Oke is made, Towring amidst a flowring field, Adorn'd with many a battred shield, With Trophies hanging on his twists, (The gifts of famous Martialists) And though not rooted deepe in land, With his owne weight vpright doth stand: With leauelesse armes spreading his spraies From naked trunkes doth shadowes raise. Yet (brangling with tempestuous blast) Is danger'd to be ouer-cast: When other trees, growne round about, Against the windes standing more stout, To this old Oke doe lowly lowt. But Cæsars name (in mens conceit) Was not yet growne vnto that height, Nor for the warres in like request: Cæsars disposition described And yet his vertue cannot rest, But prickes him forth to thinke it shame, By valour not to winne the game. His dreadlesse courage, and his hope Vnto his plots, gaue ample scope Neuer to spare his daring sword, Where glory might him worke affoord, And his success-full fate pursue, Which in heauens fauour daily grew. Affecting all, daunts as him lists, What force soeuer him resists, Contented best when that he may Leuell out paths for Ruines way. Like lightning, gendred in the Clouds, By force of winde it selfe vnshroudes, Teares through the aire with claps of thunder, (Mazing the world twixt feare and wonder.) The Temples filles with oblique flashes, And of their lampes the lights out dashes, The strongest walles asunder rents, If they resist, or stop his vents, And spoyling all, makes Reuell-rout In going in, and comming out; Collects his parted flames againe, And with fresh force doth striue and straine, Gainst which resistance all is vaine. These former motiues led the way Vnto these Captaines lawlesse sway. But publique seeds were after sowne, The Roman Vices.From whence this banefull strife is growne Which hath great Kingdoms ouerthrowne. O this was it when conquering Fates Had made vs Lords of mighty states, And cloyd vs with aboundant treasure, Wealth the cause of all excesse.We steept our thoughts in pride &amp; pleasure. Then Luxurie the State surpriz'd, And vertuous manners grew disguis'd: For Auarice (that rauening gull, Who more she hath, the lesse is full) To stately mansions drawes their mindes, And Gluttony new dainties findes; The moderate dyet not regarded, Our appetite must now bee larded. So men from manly humors fall, And grew effeminate withall: Decking themselues with queint attires, Scarce fit for womens nice desires. The great alteration of the Roman humors.Then Pouerty (that had of yore Of worthy Champions bred such store) Did scorned creepe from doore to doore. And Riches (michiefes pleasing guest) Then onely grew into request Pamperd Delight spares for no charge. Their Territories they inlarge. Camyllus Plow eares not their lands, Nor Curios spades will fit their hands. Their bounds no measure can endure, And strangers must their farmes manure: And yet this opulent increase, Could not containe their mindes in peace: But as their plenty more did flow, Ambition with it more did grow. And many vices more to boote, Which in them tooke so deepe a roote, That Couetyse no crime was thought, What force could win, was held as bought. Oppression all doth ouer-awe, And wrong to right prescribeth law. Diuision between the Senate and the people. Then Faction vshers on this warre, The Senate with the people iarre. Force doth authorize their decrees, The lawes their sacred freedome leese, Consuls with Tribunes now contest, Priuate respects their censures wrest, All suffrages are bought and priz'd, The Consulships are Merchandiz'd, And Bribery (the Cities bane) Did Campus Martius so prophane, That her braue Palmes (the Victors hire) The purses vertue did acquire. Then Vsuryes moth-eating trade So rife was growne, and lawlesse made, That Debters, at the payment day, Honors bought and sold, and not conferred by merit. To Creditors became a pray. So Banque-rupts (wanting meanes to liue) Their hopes to warre and spoyle did giue. Now Cæsars Army marcheth fast, And ore the frosty Alpes was past: But ere he said, The dyce are cast, Within his troubled thoughts he scand The boysterous stormes of warres at hand: And (hauing led his legions on Vnto the Riuer Rubicon) In gloomy night there did appeare Cæsar marching toward Rubicon, is forbidden by an apparition. (In dreames to him with trembling cheere) Of Italy the Image vaste, With naked Armes abroad out cast. And (as a woman in distresse) Shaking her head, and fettred tresse, That was ingrain'd with aged hoare, In sobbing speech doth thus deplore. Whither (quoth she) doth your march tend? Whither (deere sonnes) and to what end My famous Standard do you spread? Can lawfully these Troopes be led Vnto this place prohibited? Therewith did Horrors heauinesse This Captaines spirits so oppresse, As that his haire stood vp an end, And faintnesse doth his pace suspend. Then at the Riuers brinke he stayes, And with a manly voyce he sayes: Cæsars answere to the Apparition. Great Thunderer, that dost protect (From thy Tarpeyan high prospect) The Romane State with grace diuine, The Iulian and the Latine Line, The mysteries of rap't Quirine; O Iupiter the Latium guide, That in high Alba dost reside, Preseruer of our Vestall flame; And Rome (thou type of supreame name) From your applause doe not exempt This enterprise, that I attempt. I doe not I, with furious armes, Cæsars Protestation to Rome.(Deare Citty) seeke thy wrackes or harmes. Behold thy Cæsar here doth stand, That hath (with his success-full hand) Conquer'd for thee by sea and land. Let me thy Champion now be hight, And deeme him heynous in thy sight, That me prouokes to such debate, As must disturbe thy setled state. This said, he shakes off all delay That might his speedy passage stay: His armed legions he will guide Cæsar wil passe the Rubicon with his legions.Vnto the Riuers further side: And as a Lybian Lyon dread, (In sun-burnt Desarts bloody bred) When Hunters neere at hand he spyes, Vpon the sandy soyle downe lies, And doth a while amaz'd remaine, Till his fierce courage comes againe; Then rouzing vp his curled crest, His beesom'd tayle, and boysterous breast, From yawning iawes (besmear'd with gore) Doth bellow out a hideous rore. If then the Mauritanian launce Vpon his rugged hide doe glaunce, Or in his wounded bleeding side, The Hunters Iauelin doe abide; He carelesse then for losse of blood, Assailes (with ramping fiery mood) The Huntsman; and (with out stretcht pawes) By force at last himselfe withdrawes. Cleare Rubicon (that first is fed The description of Rubicon. But from a bubling fountaines head) During the time of Summers sunne, With a low shallow streame doth runne: His current through the valleys glides, And Italy from Gaule diuides. But at this time his source was more, The Winters raine increast his store. The Moone likewise (but yong in dayes) His feeding springs doth higher raise. And that which made him most to swell, Were molten heapes of snow that fell From downe the Alpes in torrents great, Dissolued by some gentle heate. The Horse-men first the worke doe wage, Cæsar passeth Rubicon. And of the streame the shallowes gage. And with thicke Troopes in close arrayes, The swiftnesse of the torrent stayes. The passage thus more easie made, The Foote doth through the riuer wade. Cæsar his Army thus at last Forbidden Rubicon hath past; And standing on th' Hesperian bankes, Cæsars speech when he had past the Rubicon. Thus spake he to his filed Rankes. Heere doe I now all peace abiure, And lawes vniustly put in vre. O Fortune! I will follow thee, From other bonds my selfe I free. In Fate my trust I doe affye, Warre (as a Iudge) my cause shall trye. No more he said, but (with dispach) At the approach of nights first watch, His well-train'd Troopes he doth prepare, Who in their march as speedy are As motions of Balarian slings, That circling through the thin aire sings. Or showres of shafts at Parths let flye, When they retire, that dimme the sky: His March with such great speede hee plies, Cæsar surpriseth AriminumAs doth Ariminum surprise. Phœbus by this, with dawning light, Obscured had the lampes of night; And now the dismall day begunne, Wherein his first attempt was done Vpon this Cittie, that doth stand A frontier of Italian land. And whether Fates did so fore-cast, Or foggy-faced Austers blast Did scoule vpon this wretched fact, The aire with misty clouds was pact. The Towne thus suddenly possest, The Market-place they doe inuest. Where their braue Ensignes proudly stands, Guarded with many armed bands. The Trumpets (with their dreadfull notes Drawn through their hoarse Meandry throat: Mixt with tempestuous noyse of warres) The Burgers with Alarums skarres. Their state, which was secure at night, By dawne of day was in this fright. The youth amaz'd, their beds forsake, The amazement of the Ariminenses.And to the Temples them betake. Where they doe arme them in a stownd, With such munitions as they found, Which in long peace hang'd on the walles Idle, vn-vsd to Martiall brawles. The Shields, that were of ancient dates, VVorme-eaten to the very plates. Their Piles with heads blunted and bowd, Their glaiues the cankered rust did cloud. But when the Egle was displaid, And Cæsar (in bright Armes arrayd) Mounted vpon a Throne of State, In midst of his sterne Legions sate; The Cittizens then silent were, Their senses rap't with numming feare, A patient silence them possest, The c?plaint of the Ariminenses. Whilst these sad mones boyle in their brest. What dismall Planets wrathfull frowne, So neere the Gaules, confin'd our Towne? What Destiny (with endlesse toyle) First drew vs to this fatall soyle? In peace all people liue secure: But we in peace must warres endure, To Out-rage we are still a pray, Our seate stands so in Harmes high-way. O Fortune! more had we beene blest, In dwelling farthest East or West: Or neere the Pole to haue our homes: Or else in Tents, that wandring roames; Then thus to keepe a Frontier gate Of Italies enuied state. We first did see that great deluge Of the fierce Senons Army huge. VVe first endur'd the Cymbrian brunt, Er'e Marius force did them confrunt. The many wracks that Ariminum had endured. And frightfull bruted Hanniball, Did at his entrance on vs fall. Then sauage Troopes of Teuton swarmes, Infested vs with hostile armes. And thus as oft as lowring Fate Did please to scourge the Roman state, (By raising vp some powerfull foe) This was the way that Warre did goe. These sower accounts that them attaint, They swallow vp without complaint. And so their discontentment hide, Heart-breaking sorrow is tongue-ty'd. But looke what silence doth possesse The aire, when Winter doth distresse The singing birds, and them restraines From vtt'ring their melodious vaines: Or else as calmes the billowes bindes, Not being mou'd with gusts of windes, Such stiffnes ceas'd their grief-bound minds. This dayes worke done, and ouer-past, And following night growne to his last, The Sunne his Chariot Eastward hies, And with his beames doth cleare the skies. Cæsar (that doubtfull yet remain'd Before this entrance he had gain'd) Is now, in hot bloud, fully bent To follow on his bold attempt. The Fates likewise his humour drawes Dreadlesse to breake all leagues and lawes. Cæsar the child of Fortune.And Fortune (whose he was avowd) His enterprise, as iust, allowd; And motiue reasons doth prouide To trust to Armes, lest worse betide. The Iealousie of the Senate.The iealous Senate now fore-cast What danger former times had past By the seditious Gracchian fact, That with the people were compact, And thereupon (against all right) The Court, with ouer-bearing might, Those Tribunes presently expell, Whose power did in the Citty swell, And with the Senate so contest, For Cæsars right, against their hest: The Tribunes disgraced by the Senate.The fiered Tribunes (thus disgrac't) Forthwith to Cæsars campe did hast. But he, that felt himselfe most strong Was Curio, that, (with bribed tongue) The Senate so much had vpbrayd, And peoples voyce for Cæsar swayd. And he no sooner was arriu'd At Cæsars Campe (of feare depriu'd) To Cæsar he himselfe presents, Whom many carefull thoughts torments, In plotting of these warres euents. Cæsar, quoth he, whilst Iustice, lawes Curios oration. Gaue vpright hearing to thy cause; And that a truthfull tongue might speake, So long my words the yce did breake: And durst confront thy proudest foes, Yea though the Senate did oppose. For whilst I might (as Tribune) pleade The peoples voyce so did I lead, That thou hadst their applauses all, A longer time to gouerne Gaule. But after this the Senates might Curio accuseth the Senate. (Against all law with scornfull spight) Vs as a factious party held, And from our natiue Rome expeld: Which out-rage and oppressiue scorne, With greater patience wee haue borne; In hope that thy victorious arme Their Dung-hill crowing so will charme, As shall our liberties restore Free Roman Tribunes, as before. Now therefore whilst surprising frights Possesse thy foes, and daunts their sprights: Whilst they confusd (twixt hope and feare) Know not on suddaine how to reare Such valiant Troopes, and trained Bands, As now are vnder Cæsars hands; Slacke thou no time: Fate guides thy game, To men prepar'd, delay is shame: And doe but to remembrance call The dangers past in conquering Gaule, Thy toyles that thou didst vnder-goe, Curio stirres Cæsar to attempt Rome. Before thou couldst subdue that foe; And then compare it with this taske, Which doth but resolution aske; And thou shalt finde this of lesse paine, But greater much in glorious gaine. Couldst thou ten yeares on Gallia spare, So poore to Rome in all compare; And canst thou thinke lesse time worse spent, To win the whole world to thy bent? Fortune (that still with thee abounds) When thou dost march, her Trumpet sounds: A strong perswasion.Then to this worke with courage fall, In conquering Rome thou conquerst all. But as the case now stands with thee, No Triumphes will allowed be At thy returne, for seruice done, Nor Laurels worne for Gallia wonne. Enuy (that doth at vertue spurne) Will at thy triumph rather mourne: And (which is more to thy disgrace) The honour of thy name to base. Curio perswades Cæsar that the Senate conspire to wrong him.Thy enuious foes haue plotted prankes To cut thy conquests short of thankes, And will in lew thereof, at last, Some fowle aspersion on thee cast. Pompey, that matcht thy daughter deere, Admits thee not his equall Peere, The Empire must be shar'd twixt none, But thou mayst haue it all alone. This speech of Curio sets on fire The minde of Cæsar, whose desire Before to warre was fully set, But with these words more sharply whet. Like a proud Courser bred in Thrace, Cæsar incensed.Accustom'd to the running race, Who when he heares the Trumpets noyse, The shouts and cryes of men and boyes, (Though in the stable close vp-pent) Yet, with his hoofes, doth beat and rent The planched floore, the barres and chaines, Vntill he haue got loose the raines. Cæsar forthwith his troopes doth call, T'attend him at his Tribunall: And euery Ensigne to be man'd, And followed with his armed band. So in the midst his place he takes: Then head and hand he beckning shakes, Cæsars oration to his Souldiers.And therewithall deepe silence makes. Fellowes in Armes and friends (quoth he) That haue this ten yeares space, with me, In warres endur'd a thousand brunts, With many hazards, and affronts; And yet haue brought our foes at length Vnder our feet, by conquering strength. Is this that Curio now relates, All the esteeme the Roman States Doth make of vs, and our lost blood, Expended for the Empires good, By conquest of this Northerne soyle? Is this the hire of all our toyle About the frosty Alpes endur'd, That many a Worthies bane procur'd? Though Rome so scorne her Martiall breed, Yet is she now as hard besteed, As when the Carthaginian sway Ouer the Alpes did force a way. Her wasted Cohorts are supplyd With men, that warre hath neuer try'd: But meere Besognios prest in hast. And now the woods are feld as fast To build a Nauy out of hand: And Cæsar (as I vnderstand) Must be pursu'd by sea and land. But now suppose some man will say, What if (in one vnlucky day) When we doe hope to giue a blow, Our selues receiue the ouer-throw? And that the Gaules (to venge their wrackes) With furious swarmes come on our backes? Alas poore sprights! what doubts are these? Since Fortune swayes which way I please, And alwayes prospers my designes? And that the Gods their grace inclines Our glory higher to aduance? When Fortune pipes, shall we not dance? Let Pompey (whom dis-vse hath made Cæsars scornefull speech of Pompey, and some other Romanes. A stranger to Bellona's trade) Come on, with his new swaggering host, Which cannot of one Skirmish boast. Let Senators (in their graue gownes) Brow-beat vs with their haughty frownes. And Marcell, that same pratling Iay, With Stoicke Cato, that giues way To nought but what himselfe doth say: Let all this rabble shew their spight, We scorne their malice, and their might. Shall these consorts (for money bought) Pompey to please, set vs at nought? Shall they so proudly vndertake In him a Monarchy to make? Pompey taxed in diuers kindsMust our great Empires supreme sway, Him onely serue, and sole obay? Must he (with new insulting pride) Againe in Triumphes Chariot ride? When no man knowes for what, or why; But all due course doth it deny? What, must he neuer quit againe The rule, that once he doth attaine? Nor suffer others haue their turne? Must he at all mens honours spurne? Who liueth now that doth not know The famine that did ouer-flow By publicke dearth of corne and bread, Whereby his auarice was fed? Who knowes not that (by his affront Contrary to the Roman wont) The Iudges, in the Market-place, Assaulted were with foule disgrace? And with what pride he bolstred out The out-rage of that rascall rout? And how, by maine oppressing might, (Against all law and ciuill right) Milo. Milo, that so condemned stood, Clodius.For fouly shedding Clodius blood, By Pompeys rude presumptious bands, Was rescu'd out of Iustice hands? But now, he waxing old and craz'd, Yet still affecting to bee blaz'd, And fearing that his date, farre spent, Will grow vnfit for gouernment, Cæsar chargeth Pompey with the cause of this ciuill war. Lothing to lead a priuate life, Now makes new worke for ciuill strife: Wherein he trained is so well, As that he doth by farre excell His Tutor Sylla, bloudy sire, That mischiefe-monger ruines fire. And as a Tyger wildly fed, In the Hyrcanian forrest bred, Who (following of his rauening damme With blood of beasts his panch doth cram) Can neuer afterwards allay His sauage longing after pray; So Pompey (nuz'led in the taste Pompey a follower of Sylla. Of Syllas sword, that made such waste Of his owne countries guiltlesse blood) Cannot asswage his thirsting mood: But that his iawes (in-vr'd to gore) Must bathe in bowels, as before. Shall his vsurped lawlesse state Nor limits haue, nor any date? How long shall he (with hands vncleane) Support his pride, that holds no meane? His Maister Sylla might him learne By (his example) to discerne, That Tyranny at length should end, And aged hopes to quyet bend. Must Cæsar needes giue vp his rest, Because the Pyrats are supprest, And Mithridates, with long toyle, At length receiued hath the foyle? Although it cannot be deny'd But Pontus poysons first he try'd. Shall Cæsar now (I say) be made Cæsar alleageth the wrongs offered him by the Senats decree A prey to Pompeys rusty blade, Because I scorned to forgoe My conquering Legions to my foe? And disobeyd that proud decree, Made against right in wrong of me? But though I be deny'd my due, And that no Triumphes must acrew Vnto our conquest, as our hire, Yet (whilst I breath with liuing fire) And these braue Troopes are led by me, They neuer shall defrauded be Cæsar insinuates with his Souldiers.Of their reward for seruice done, Nor after stranger Captaines runne To seeke new Fortunes at their hands, In forraigne warres, and vnknowne lands. For if that such a course be held, When they be ouer-growne with eld; And not of force, as earst they were, To broyle in warres, and armes to beare; Where shall they then their limbes repose, Weakned with age, with toyle and blowes? What comfort should they finde at last, To recompence their trauailes past? What lands to them shall be alowd? What fields to plant, or to be plowd? Where they in peace may eate their bread, And rest their limbes in quiet bed? Cæsar aleageth Pompeys prouision for pyrats whilst old Roman Veterans are neglected.Shall Pyrats so (by Pompeys grace) In fruitfull Colonies finde place, And Roman Veterans not haue That due regard their worth doth craue? O then resolue (without delay) Your conquering Ensignes to display. Imploy those armes in battailes try'd, By your owne valour dignify'd. Vniustly to with-hold a right, Is to giue all to armed might. We want not higher powers to frend, Yet do not I this Mart intend, Prest on for need, or greedy gaine, Cæsars protestation against tyrannicall ambition.Or else ambitiously to raine; But to resist that Pride that raues To make both Rome and vs his slaues. When he had said, the wauering rout Did softly murmur many a doubt: For though their fiery Martiall sprights In warre and rapine most delights; Their houshold Gods, and Countries loue, To some remorce their hearts did moue. But yet of Armes the high esteeme, And Cæsars wrath they greater deeme. Then Lœlius, with vndaunted face, Lœlius. (Who for his valour held the place Amongst the Pyles as Ensigne chiefe, And (by his hardy hands reliefe) A Roman rescu'd from his foes: For which his Oken crowne he showes) Steps forth, and thus he doth declame. Conductor chiefe of Roman fame; Lœlius oration to Cæsar. If it be lawfull, and but iust To shew our griefes with tongues of trust, We may complaine of these delayes, That with such lingring patience stayes Thy powerfull armes; did our faith faile In ought that might thy course auaile? Will we (thinkst thou) whilst life retaines The boyling blood within ous vaines: Or whilst our actiue armes haue might To weild the Pile with Martiall slight, Endure thus to subiect our State To Senate gownes degenerate? Is it a fault by ciuill warre, Their insolencies to debarre? Nay, leade vs through Scyths ysie fennes, And through the Syrts vnhaunted dennes, Through Lybia's thirsty parched sands; Heere are the selfe-same forward hands That holpe through deeps to tugge the Ores, When thou inuadedst Brittaines shores: And (with like courage ready were) Lœlius deuotes his faith to Cæsar. Through stickle Rhene the boates to steare, Our hearts shall be as forward still, As able to obey thy will. And whom against thy Trumpets sound, I wish mischance may them confound. Yea though they be right Romans borne, As deadly foes I will them scorne. And here I doe protest and sweare By those braue Ensignes (that we beare) Of our victorious legions ten, By all the conquests where and when So happily atchieu'd by thee; Lœlius most desperate protestation for Cæsars seruice.If thou but giue in charge to me, To stabbe my brother to the heart, My fathers head and necke to part, Or to rippe vp (with bloudy knife) The rising belly of my wife, When she conceiued is with childe, My hands should be therewith defil'd, Though they said nay, with mood more mild Yea, if it were the Gods to spoyle, To raze their Temples with the soyle, Their ornaments and wealth to burne, Vntill to ashes they did turne, Or else (vpon the Tyber bankes) To place and file our armed rankes, I would be first of all the Rout, That should the Stations quarter out, There to incampe our legions stout. Nay, do but say, which are the walles That thou design'st to Ruines falles, These hands of mine first hold shall lay Vpon the Ramme, and giue him sway Vnto the ground, the stones to teare; Yea though the walles of Rome they were. When Lœlius thundring peale was rung, The Cohorts (clustring in a thrung, With open voyce, and hands out flung) The affection Cæsars souldiers do beare to him.Do vow to follow Cæsars Armes, Through heat and cold, through haps or harms And therewithall they bellow out As maine a cry (with hideous shout) As doe the hurling windes from Thrace, When they the lofty Pines imbrace That on the mountaine Ossa growes, Whose stormy gusts so fiercely blowes, That toppes of Trees bow to the ground, And with such force againe rebound, As if they would the clouds confound. Cæsar, that now his Souldiers minds So prone to warre and willing findes, (Seeing withall the Fates his friend) Is loath more time in vaine to spend. But least his Fortune should be staid For want of force and greater aid, Forthwith in haste he sends for all Cæsar assembles his forces His Cohorts, garrison'd in Gaule. Then flying Ensignes doth display, And towards Rome directs his way. The Troopes, about Lemanus Lake, To Cæsars Campe themselues betake: And those great forces of account, That fortifide Vogesus mount, And fierce Lingones held in awe, To Cæsars tents doe likewise draw. Others, that with his warres will share, From Isar floud to him repare, Which (washing with his water falles So many goodly Citties walles) His siluer streames at last he hides In Rhodonus, that swifter slides, And there his natiue name doth lose, Before that he the Ocean knowes. The gold-hair'd Ruthens left at large, Their maistering garrisons discharge. And silent Atax new ioy greeets Dis-burdened of the Latium Fleets. The gallant Townes that bordering rankes On either side of Varus bankes Doe publique bone-fire-feasting make, When Roman Troopes their soile forsake. The like contentment them befell, That by th' Herculean port do dwell; Vpon which shores (in rowling flockes) The boysterous billowes sweepe the rockes; Not stird with rage of Westerne flawes, But by whirle-windes that thither drawes. From off the Narbonensian coast, Where shippes so furiously are tost, As that no harbour can suffise To shelter them from those fierce skyes, So ioy'd the people of that land, That euermore doe doubtfull stand To be orewhelm'd with flowing seas; As oft it haps to their disease: Which flouds, the ebbes againe appease. Now whether this deluge proceedes From Northerne winds, that high seas breeds During their powerfull whirling whiffes, That raise the waues aboue the cliffes, And being layd, the stilled maine Reclaimes her mounted waues againe: Or whether Cynthias influence Do with this breach of bounds dispence: Or else the Sunnes attractiue beames Exhale vp vapours from those streames, Thereby the watry clouds to feede: Or else from whence it doth proceede, I leaue it to their better reede Opinions of ebbing and flowing of the sea.That diues into the hidden cause Of Heauens course, and Natures lawes. And as for me I will submit The censure of my humble wit To that great God-head, that best knowes The reason why it ebbes and flowes. Now were the Nemetes releast Of all the bands vpon them ceast: Where the Tarbellians bound at large A calmed sea, with crooked varge. Then, to the Santons turne it fell, To bid their Latium guests fare-well. The Bituriges doe the same, And the Axones that beare fame With their long bowes, so fit for Mart, The Rheni, trayn'd to throw the dart. The Sequani, that rankly ride And skilfully their horses guide. The Belgi, that so well can steere, And turne their Coach in maine careere. Th' Auverni, that themselues do grace For their descent from Troian race, And Roman parentage embrace. The Neruij, that with faithlesse words In Cotta's bloud did bath their swords. The Vangiones, that desire To weare the Sarmatan attire. The stout Battaui, that delight VVhen Trumpets call them forth to fight. And all those people that are bred And harbour about Cyngaes head, VVhere Rhodonus so swiftly fleets, VVith whom the Riuer Arar meets, And Neptune with their tribute greets. Or what inhabitants beside About Gebenna's mount reside, All these to mirth conuert their moane, That Latine Garrisons are gone. And Treuers turne to ioy their teares, To see the Romans by the eares. And you Lygiers the rest among, That vsd to weare your lockes so long, For which of old the common fame Comated Gaules gaue you the name: (Though now you changed haue that guise) From Garrisons were freed likewise. So all those Nations that did vse Mercurius Altars to infuse, And sprinkle round with humane blood. And you (that with like sauage mood) To Mars make cruell sacrifice. And yee, that do mens hearts agrise VVhen you to Ioue your offrings make, And fires with humane bloud do slake, VVhose Altars therewith you distaine, As deepe as Scythians vse to baine Diana's Altars, and much more, So doe they ouer-flow with gore. And yee O Bards, that (with your rimes) Record their fame to future times, That valiantly expose their blood For honour, and their Countries good. And Druides high Priests of hell, That in all barbarous Rites excell, Who (by your vncoth Sorc'rous spell) Pretend that you alone can tell The influence of the starres that shine, And natures of the powers diuine; Now may you freely, at your willes, Solace your selues in woody hilles, And build your boothes on topps of Trees, And preach your Doctrines and Decrees, Whereof you Authors are alone; For now the Roman Rites are gone. Now you may silly fooles perswade, That (when death hath his conquest made) Mens soules descend not to the shades Of silent darke Eræbus glades, Nor where the horrid mansion is Of lothsome deepe-indungion'd Dis: But (when that this worlds life is done) Their soules into new bodies runne. So losse of life to them brings gaine, That would eternity attaine. For in another world to liue, You say Death onely meanes can giue. The great resolution of the Druides.Yee that in this opinion dwell, In happinesse doe farre excell All Northerne nations that are knowne: For where you haue this errour sowne, All feare of death is cast aside, Which terror most the heart doth gryde. And from this confidence proceedes Your valour, and your ventrous deedes. Whose dauntlesse braue ennobled sprights, Meetes deaths approches without frights. And holds it base for to adiurne Life, that (so lost) will soone returne. Lastly, those mastring braue Cohorts, That shagge-heard Caicos tam'd with forts, All that Cæsar had conquered in ten yeares warres was hazarded to be lost. The bankes of Rhene vnguarded leaue, And Cæsars host doth them receiue. Loe what a world, wonne with long paine, Is at an instant lost againe. Cæsar (with these collected swarmes Of valiant Souldiers, bred in Armes) His haughty courage doth aduance At greater game to try his chance. His ranging Troopes, with spirits fierce, Through Latium fields he doth disperse: And all the Townes he doth surprize, VVith garrisons he fortifies. Then Fame (that doth false rumors blaze) His foes with true feares doth amaze. The Citizens in generall The feares that the rumors of Cæsars approach breedes at Rome. Into despairefull humors fall: And in their daunted mindes debate The fortunes of a conquered state. Like fearefull Scowts, that set a broach False Larums of a foes approach: So Romes imaginary feares VVith her owne tongues affrights her eares. Then from Meuania tidings came (A Towne ennobled by the fame Of that rich soyle wherein it stands) That Cæsar (with huge armed bands) Had ouer-runne, and pray'd their lands.) And many of his men of warre VVere come vnto the bankes of Nar, (VVhich Riuer into Tyber falles) And thence would march vnto the walles The fame of Cæsars comming to Rome. Of Rome it selfe, without delay: And that they did, at large, display Their Banners, and their Egles braue: That such a mighty host they haue As neuer yet (the rumor ran) VVas seene in memory of man. Yea much more fierce and truculent Then those (that were most bloudy bent) Of all the people ruthlesse rude, That Romans euer yet subdu'd. Others againe gaue out reports, That daily to this Campe resorts Those Nations (that do dwell betweene The frozen Alpes and Northerne Rhene) And that they all with one accord, From out their Countries did dis-bord, Cæsar to follow, and to ayd; And from these warres would not be stayd: So as it cannot other be, But that with griefe they soone shall see Rome seiz'd and sackt by forraine fone, (A Roman Chiefe-taine looking on) Thus euery one (rap't with amaze) Doth these approching perils blaze. And yet no certaine Authors knowne, By whom this frighting newes is blowne: But what their weake conceits suggest, With that their sences are opprest. Neither did this vnmanly doubt Onely appall the common rout; But euen the Senate, drownd in dread, Leauing their homes, the Citty fled. Yet they decreed at their adiew, The Consuls should with force pursue Cæsar, from whom the Senate flew. The Senate flie from RomeTo safest places then they runne, And where is hazard, that they shunne. The giddy people they exhort To ioyne themselues in their consort, And with them such aduentures bide, As meanes and fortune could prouide. Loe thus (with many heauy hearts) Huge numbers instantly departs. He that their sudden flight had seene, Would thinke all Rome on fire had beene: Or else some Earth-quakes fearefull rage Their tottering houses did ingage. For (with such boysterous presse and cry) Out at the Citty gates they flye: As if no better hope remain'd To men (whom froward fates constrain'd) Then to forsake their natiue home, To seeke for refuge where they roame. Like as a shippe with tempests tost, Driuing vpon the Lybian coast, Intangled with Sirts wracking sands, The crazed mast in danger stands, With sailes and cordage rent and torne, All ouer ship-boord to be borne: The Pylot, whom dispaire doth ceaze, First head-long leaps into the seas, And after him (with madding vaine) The Saylers plunge into the maine: And so themselues to death betake, Before the vessell ship-wracke make. The Roman frights and flying. So out in droues the Romans flye Before that Cæsars Campe was nye, And left Rome for her selfe to try. No parents counsaile could asswage Their head-strong childrens flying rage. Nor louing wiues lamenting teares To pitty turne their husbands feares: Nor awe of Gods, nor Countries loue Their parting humor could remoue; Through brutish feare, with base neglect, All Natures bonds they did reiect: The place where they were bred and borne, They fled with shame, and left forlorne. In their owne houses, where they dwell, They stay no time to bid fare-well: Nor any such affection shew To their deere Citty, ere they goe, As with full sight her to deplore, Whom they perchance shold see no more, All flye in hast from Tybers shore. Yee Gods with bounty fortunes lend But niggardly doe them defend. This Citty, that did so abound With Citizens, for warres renownd, Obey'd with many conquered slaues, Now euery flying rumor braues. And (as a spoyle and open pray) Abandoned to Cæsars sway. The valiant Romans, that were wont The Roman Citizens fall from their old wonted valor.(In forraigne warres) to beare the brunt Of many mighty barbarous foes, Did in their Armes such trust repose; That slender trenches did suffise, To hold them safe from all surprise. And by such meanes securely kept Their guarded Tents whilst that they slept. But thou, O Rome, from this art farre, Daunted but with the name of Warre. Thy walles not deem'd to be of might To lodge thy people safe one night: So faint of courage all and some Are thy inhabitants become. But yet thy Commons may defend Pompey taxed for flying fr? Rome at the bruite of Cæsars approch.Themselues, and for excuse pretend, That they were not possest with dread Before they saw great Pompey fled, By whose example they were led. Then (that no hope of future chance) Their based courage should aduance) Apparant signes they doe descry Of worse euents approching nye. The supreme pow'r wrath-threatning wills The Aire, the Earth, and Ocean filles With Prodigies, foretelling illes. In silent nights, that darkest beene, Many prodigious signes seene before these ciuill warres.Many strange vncoth starres are seene. The Element all flaming was, And through the aire did flying passe Obliquous streames, like torches bright, And tayled Comets shew by night, With Blazing starres, that doe presage Of changing states the future rage. Then fearefull lightning flashes breake A thwart the clouds, and thundring speake: With sundry shapes of fearefull fires The aire is fild with all admires. Sometimes like lampes, somtimes like darts, And so to sparkling gleames conuerts, Which ouer all the skies doth blaze. And (that which bred no lesse amaze) Strange lightnings oftentimes did hap, (Not seconded with thunder-clap) When as no clouds the Sunne did wrap. And Rome it selfe (to wracke design'd) Was scorcht with blasting Northerne winde. The lesser starres (seene but by night) At midde of day appeared bright. The Moone at full (that with round face Should represent her brothers grace) The interposing earth obscures. Tytan likewise this change endures, That when at Noone-steed, in his pride, Ouer the earth his sheene should stride, His face was maskt with sable vayle, And day-light through the world doth faile. So as men greatly stood in doubt, That such a time was come about, As when Thyestes babes were slaine: Which guilt the Sunne did so disdaine, That (loathing to adorne that day) Backe to the East he posts away. And cole-smeer'd Vulcan doth the varge Of Ætna's forge so much inlarge: As that the sparkes, wont vp to hye With rowling smoke into the skye, Now to Italia shores doe flye. Charybdis (like a glutted wolfe) So spues vp bloud from her vaste gulfe, As that the sanguine dye doth staine The waues of the Cicilian maine. And Scylla's Dogges so lowd did yell, As they had beene the hounds of hell. Then did the sacred Vestall fire Diuide it selfe with forked spire Vpon the Altars, where it burnes: Whose parted flames, presaging, mournes The proud diuision and debate That should confound the Roman state. As did that flame diuide in twaine, Which burnt the Thebans brothers slaine. Then followes on such huge Earth-quakes, That from the lofty Alpes it shakes The snow, that tumbles downe in flakes. And Atlas mount (whom some conceit To shoulder vp the heau'ns whole weight: And Calpe, that high hill in Spaine, Were well-nye couered with the maine. The Temple Images withall, From out their eyes did teares let fall. The Houshold Gods did likewise sweate, To witnesse Romes distempered heat. And all the sacred gifts downe falles, That hung about their Temple walles. The Screech-owles, and the birds of night, VVere common seene in broad day light. And sauage beasts without dismay, (Leauing their dennes at close of day) would come to Rome their rest to take, And in the streetes their kennels make: And cattell humane language spake. VVomen likewise the sight did feare Of their owne births, which monstrous were. Sybilla, that Cumana hight, Her prophesies were brought to light, Then those whom sterne Bellonas ire VVith franticke humors did inspire, (Tearing their armes) did rauing cry, The vengeance of the Gods was nye. The grisely ghosts of Gallicke flockes, (Shaking their bloudy-fettred lockes) Vnto the people threatning tell Many a heauy fearfull spell. And from the shrines the heaped bones Did often mutter ruthfull grones. Clashing of armes, and horrid founds, From the vnhaunted groues rebounds: And many apparitions strange So neere the Citty-walles did range, That they, which in the Sub-vrbes wonne, Did from their homes affrighted runne. An vgly Fiend, (that in her hand Did hold a sparkle-blazing brand, With snaky haire about her face) Alongst the streets did stalking trace. Euen such a one as did constraine Agaue with a franticke vaine: Or that Licurgus did incite To wound himselfe through Bacchus spight? Or like Megera, whose aspect Did more Alcides spright deiect Then Dis with his infernall looke, When Iunos taske he vndertooke. And oft by night, when all was still, The Trumpets sounds were heard as shrill, And shoutings maine with clamorous cries, As when two hoasts together flies. And Sylla's ghost lamenting rombd In Mars his field where it was fombd. Which by coniecture did presage Some bloudy broiles and ciuill rage. So from his broken Sepulcher, Was Marius seene his head to reare, That by Arriems brinke did stand, Wherewith the Peasants of that land Were so surpriz'd (with trembling fits) That some were scard out of their wits. These tokens do the Romans cause (According to their ancient lawes) In cases of so great dismay, To send for those without delay, That could by diuinations gesse, If flights of fowles might ought expresse. Or else if bowels of beasts slaine, These strange presages could explaine, Then from Tuscana one ariu'd That in such mysteries had diu'd, Aruns, an Augur, seekes out the causes of the ciuill war by diuination.That he knew well the course of heauen, And influence of the Planets seuen. And Aruns was this wisards name, Who from the Citty Luna came. This solemne sire did first decree, That all such beasts destroy'd should be As were ingendred against kinde, And vnto monstrous shapes inclind. And that same vgly fleshy clot (Vpon a barren Mule begot) Should be consum'd in Cinders hot. Then he the frighted Burgers calles To march about the Citty-walles A Roman procession. Procession-like in ordred rowes, And first the sacred Bishops goes. And in their turnes next to them trace Prelates of an inferior place, In short roabes with Gabinian braids. The Matron then of Vesta's maids, (To whom it lawfull was alone, That Pallas Temple should be knowne) Doth follow with her virgin-traine: Then all such Priests as appertaine To Oracles, and Sybils loare, With those that drew vnto the shore Cybellen, out of Almon flood. The Augures then that vnderstood Of all vnlucky birds the flight. And the Septemviri that dight And ouerlooke the solemne feasts. Then Titius Priests, whose sacred heasts The sub-vrbs of the Citty swayes In all their ceremoniall wayes, Then next the dauncing Salij ranke, Whose necks guilt gawdy brooches pranke, And last of this religious fry The holy Flamen he past by With Lordly Turbant towring high. Whilst (in a long out-stretched droue) They thus about the walles do roue, Aruns the scattered ruines tooke, That with the lightning blasts were strooke: And (when some muttring charms were said) Deepe vnder mould the same he laid. And euery place (where they were shrin'd) With names and characters he sign'd. Then doth he take a faire large bull, (Which he out of a heard did cull) And him vnto the Altar leades, A Bull sacrificed. And twixt his hornes pure wine he sheads. Then mingled flower, and crooked blade, For sacrifice he ready made. But yet the beast, with struggling might, Resists to serue that sacred Rite, Wherein the Gods tooke no delight. And yet at last the Priestly rout Pulles downe this Bull, that was so stout. Then bound, and laid to loose his life, Within his throat they sheath'd the knife. Which with so deepe a gash they slit, That thence abundantly did flit A reeking streame of venom blacke, Which did of blood the colour lacke. This vncouth sacrifice amaz'd Pale Aruns, whilst thereon he gaz'd. Aruns the Augur amazed. And yet againe he further seekes To finde some cause of heauens dislikes: And vp the paunch he rippeth wide, To see what lucke would there betide. But that which more did him confound, Were bowels spotted and vnsound, Of colour pale, and blew commixt, With clotted goare congeal'd betwixt. Then rotten liuer, which he saw, Was cloathed with the waterish maw; The left side guts no ill signes wants: The lung-veines neither stirres nor pants: The slender rimme too weake to part The boyling liuer from the heart: The smothered heart exprest no pulse, The crackt-shrunke intrailes did convulse Corrupted bloud into the vaines: The cawle the paunch-hest ouer-straines. And that of all (which hee found worst) No part appear'd, but seem'd accurst. Then he amongst these inwards findes Two massy heads of sinnoye kindes: Wannish the one, and all fore-spent, Flaggy, corrupt, and drooping bent: The other with more vitall heates His vaines with naughty humors beats. All these he takes to be true showes, Prognosticating future woes. Aruns afeard to expresse the coniecture.And then cryes out, O Gods I see 'Tis more then lawfull now for me To blaze abroad your high decree; Neither, O Ioue, do I designe This offering to thy grace diuine. For I suspect the fiends of hell Within these slaughtered bowels dwell. We feare mis-haps not fit to speake Aruns censure.Yet worser shortly out will breake. Heau'ns turne to good what is betide! Let no presage in bowels bide! But Tages fictions; to deuise Such mysteries in sacrifice. Tages the first inuenter of Auguring.Thus doubtfully his doome he shrowdes Of what was seene, and spake in clouds. But Figulus that deeply lookes Into the heau'ns, as in his bookes; And onely did his time bestow Figulus an excellent Astrologer.The natures of the Gods to know: Who in Astrology exceld The Ægiptians, that in Memphis dweld. Thus said; either the heauens, quoth he, Disordred in their motions be, And all the Planets (in their sway) Doe hold a cleane contrary way; Or else if prouidence diuine Thus strangely guide them to encline, Sudden and heauy wracke will fall Doubtfull coniectures. Vpon this Citty, and vs all. But whether the Earth gaping wide, VVill in her wombe whole Cities hide: Or whether the contagious Aire, VVith pestilence will health impaire: Or that the Land barren of food, VVill cease to nourish humane brood: Or that the Riuers from their heads Streames with infectious poyson spreads: I cannot say, O supreme powers! VVhat woes vpon our mortall bowers, Or what strange plagues doe you intend Vpon this wretched world to fend? Shall now with vs all ages end? If Saturnes chill vnlucky starre Had in the tenth house rang'd his Carre; Then might Aquarius watry vaine Figulus considers the inclinations of the heauens. Haue brought Deucalions floud againe, And all the earth ore-whelm'd with raine, And raging Neptunes rising maine. Or if thou Phœbus hadst combin'd VVith Leo of Nemean kinde; The Fire would then the Earth haue melt, And with thy flames the heau'ns haue swelt. But now these planets being still; O Mars! what hath incenst thy will, (VVith the great force of thy aspect) Such beames on Scorpio to reflect As that his taile all flaming roles, VVith scorching clawes as red as coles? Milde Iupiter, with friendly eyes, Into the west his progresse hies. But Venus face (with smiling lips) Is now obscured in Eclips. And Mercury (so swift of sourse) Doth retrograde distort his course. So Mars as now in this discord, Is of th' ascendant onely Lord, And whilst all starres their roomes resignes, Blading Orion onely shines. The censure of Figulus.Fury of warre comes now in date, And force of armes will steare the State, Iustice and lawes may both goe sleepe, Strong hand will them in bondage keepe, Vice now shall Vertues name retaine, And many yeares this rage shall raigne. Prayers bootlesse against Destinie.What boots it then the Gods to pray, This misery to turne away? For peace againe we shall not haue, Till all become a Tyrants slaue. O Rome! post off (if thou haue power) The date of this vnhappy houre. Extend these furies off a farre, And vs preserue from ciuil warre. The censure of Figulus discomforteth the Romans.These hard predictions sadly told, Did make the peoples hearts full cold; But that which followed on behind, Trencht deeper wounds within their minde: For as Ædonis, Bacchus Nunne, From Pyndus hill inrag'd doth runne, When as Ogigian wine distraines The madding humor of her braines: So did a Matron of the Towne The prophesying of a Roman Matron rap't with a sudden fury.In franticke wise gadde vp and downe, Vttring such words as they expresse Whom sprights of prophesing possesse. O Pæan tell me (then she said) Vnto what place am I conuaid! What shore wilt thou cast me vpon, That rap't aboue the clouds haue gone? Me thinkes Pangeus mount I spye, Vpon whose top the snow doth lye: And thence Phillipi's fields I see, That at the foot of Hæmus be. O Phœbus tell me the intent By this great hurly-burly meant. Why doe the Roman armies straine Against themselues with might and maine? By what meanes comes it to be so, They warre without a forraine foe? Nay, whither am I further tost? Me seemes I now am on the coast Eastward, where Nylus her seuen heads VVithin the Ocean softly beds. There see I him, and him deplore, That lies vpon that sandy shore, A headlesse trunke distain'd with gore. Thence am I rap't againe anew, And now the Lybian Syrts I view, VVhere Destinies transport with spight, The remnants of Pharsalias fight. Yet further am I forst to walke Ouer the Cloud-brow'd Alpes to stalke: And in this flitting whirle-winde vease, I passe the Mountaines Pyrinees. Thence backe vnto my Natiue Towne, VVhere I finde all turn'd vp-side-downe. Vprore, diuision, and debate Turmoyles the Senate and the State. So am I now (from mine owne shore) Hurry'd about the world once more. O Phœbus, ease me of this toyle, In vnknowne seas, and vnknowne soyle, For I haue seene Philippies broyle! Thus said, a slumbring rest she takes, VVherewith this fury her forsakes. Finis Libri primi. The second Booke. The Argvment. Fore-knowledge much it doth bewaile Of woes, that needes must men assaile. The Roman Matrons plaints exprest All lawes and iustice are supprest. Marius and Sylla's rage it showes, Brutus in doubt to Cato goes, Who once againe doth Martia wed, Attir'd like mourners for the dead. Pompey to Capua takes his way, Cæsar at large beares all the sway, And doth Domitius prisoner take. Pompey doth his oration make. His sonne hee sends for more supplyes, Himselfe then at Brundusium lies, And there besieg'd, thence hardly flies. Now haue the Gods reueal'd their ire, The heauenly signes with warres conspire, And Nature likewise (with fore-sight) Her lawes and bonds peruerteth quite With monstrous tumults and garboyle, Which wretchedly doth humanes toyle. Great guider of Olimpus hill, Why hath it pleasd thy sacred will, That carefull mortals take such count Of what their skill can not surmount, As that they should presaging know Those wrackes they needs must vndergoe? Whether the All-Creator high (When first he gan to rectifie This formlesse masse of Chaos rude, And did the fire a part seclude) Whether there bee destiny or chance in worldly courses. With an eternall fixt decree Ordain'd that all should certaine be; And to that law himselfe confin'd, Wherewith all ages he did binde: And fram'd the world that course to runne, That Fates vnchanging hests had spunne? Or else of humane haps the heft Were vn-fore-doom'd at randome left? So that in lifes vncertaine dance, Things to and fro should slide and glance, And all subiected vnto chance? But howsoeuer 'tis ordain'd, O let mans minde be so restrain'd From knowing chances future scope An Imprecation against fore-knowledge. As that his feares may liue in hope! When all at length had full conceiu'd, In what sort higher powers bequeath'd The Citty to resistlesse harmes; Then lawes and iustice silence charmes; And reuerent Honour lackt his meed, Attir'd in base Plebeian weed. No Axes now (in bundles bore) Makes way the Magistrates before. Amazement so doth griefe forestall, That Sorrow hath no voyce at all. Such stupid silence doth inuest Whole families (with griefe possest) Where husbands lye, in gasping strife, Before they doe resigne their life. The good-wife wrapt in sorrowes bands, With flaring lockes wringing her hands, Amidst her wofull houshold stands: Vntill the liuing breath be fled From out the corpes (that streacht out dead) Doth in the pale disfigured face And closed eyne Deaths portraict place, Sorrow doth not at full complaine; But then begins her howling vaine. Whose mazement now with rage surprisd, Doth change her robes to weeds disguisd: And (with her wofull sad consorts) Vnto the Temples then resorts. So did our women (in their feares) Sprinkle the Temple-gods with teares. The Roman Matrons frequent the Temples with an extraordinary deuotion.Beating their breasts against the stones, Powre out their plaints and ruthful moanes. And (stupify'd twixt griefe and dread) Did rent their haires from off their head, And sacred porches therewith spread. And such as wont in humble wise To pray and cast to heauen their eyes, With outrage now the Gods would bend, Not to vse presumption in praying.Whose eares with clamours they offend. Neither to Iupiter alone, Doe they expose their vowes and mone: But to all Temples else besides, Where any of their Gods resides: The which are fild, and all too scant, No Altar doth deuotion want. So do the Matrons (with out-cries) Inuoke the Gods, and teare the skies. And one of them amongst the rest (With blubbered cheeks beating her breast) Her braided lockes in peeces cuts, And then her armes she spreads and shuts, Whilst w?? these plaints her voice she gluts The speech of a Roman Matron.O wretched Mothers now, she said, To beat your breasts be not affraid, Nor yet your tressed lockes to teare. Langor no longer now forbeare. Like happes did neuer vs assaile, For which we had such cause to waile: Whilst that the fortunes are vntry'd Of these two Chiefetaines swelling pride. But were once one of them subdu'd, Then should our comforts be renew'd: And so their plaints they aggrauate That sorrowes selfe grew passionate. Their men likewise resolu'd for warre, Now clustred into campes a farre, Against the wrathfull Gods on high, In this sort doe exclaiming cry. O haplesse Captiue-youths forlorne! Why were we not in those dayes borne, When Punicke warres did vs ingage, The c?plaints of the Romans leauing the Citty, and following the warres. With Canna's and Trebeia's rage? Yee heauens wee doe not peace desire; But on vs turne some forraigne ire: Let all the world our bane conspire; Stirre Cities vp with sword and fire. Let Parths and Persians bend their armes, Let Scythians rampe on vs in swarmes: And (from the Northerne extreme parts) Let red-haird Sweaths powre showrs of darts And with them all that people bred About the raging Rhenus head: Yea make vs to all Nations foes, So you diuert our Ciuill blowes. Then let the wrathfull Danes and Getes, All warres more pleasing to the Romans then ciuill strife. Assaile vs in their hostile heats. Let the Iberians make discent, With ensignes and with weapons bent: Vnto the Archers of the East Let Rome from no strife be releast. Nay if high powers decree the same, To raze out the Hesperian name; From heauen, to earth let flames descend; That so the Latium race may end. And then O direfull Fates withall The Romans lay a curse on Cæsar &amp; Pompey both.Grant that some hatefull wracke befall Both Factions, and the leaders both; For yet they haue not shewd their wroth. Why should they such dominion seeke, As neuer yet was heard the like? That all mens thoughts it must dismay, Whether of them the world should sway? Not both their worth can counterpaise The ciuill strife that so they raise. Thus Pieties declining state Her lamentations did relate, And parents wofully besides, Like pressing care and cumbers grides. In whose repining words appeares, The wretched fate of their old yeares: To be preseru'd in lifes disdaine, To see a ciuill warre againe. And one of them thus wail'd with teares, Th' example of great former feares. The c?plaint of an old Citizen, declaring the bloudy times of Marius and Sylla.No otherwise (quoth he) did fate Stirre vp commotion in our state; When Marius after victory Obtain'd against the Teuton fry, And after he in Triumphes Carre Had rid; for the Numidian warre. A banisht man he hid his head In dikes, where flaggie rushes bred. So did the greedy marrish fennes, And quagmire bogges shut in their dennes, (O Fortune) they reseru'd a ward; But yet anon he was not spar'd From fettring gyues, nor loathsome Iayle, VVhich long the old mans life did baile. But blest had beene if hee had dy'd, VVhen Consull he the State did guide; Before he felt the scourging doome For his mischieuous deedes at Rome. But Death it selfe did from him flye, VVhen 'twas decreed that he should dye. And that the foe was ready prest To rid the life out of his breast. When he should giue the fatall wound, Numnesse his sences so confound, And mortify'd his arme withall, That from his hand the sword did fall: Wherewith the darksome prison shone Like Phœbus beames at height of noone: He heard withall a fearefull spell, As from the gastly sprights of hell, That Marius power must come againe, Lawfull 'tis not thy steele to baine Within his bloud; therefore refraine: For he shall many doome to death, Ere he yeeld vp his latest breath. Let thy vaine rage his sword vp-sheath. But if the Cymbrian youth desires Auengement, for their slaughtered sires; Let them wish him a longer race, Who was not (by the heauens high grace) Preseru'd for good; but, by their wrath, Dessign'd to worke Romes greater scath; A murtherous man (and if Fates will) Able much Roman bloud to spill. Marius a bloudy man. This wretched wight the raging waue Into a hostile Countrey draue. Where faine he was for his reliefe (Sculking in corners like a Thiefe) To lodge in dennes where none did wonne Of Iugurths Countrey ouer-runne. And sometimes in the ruines lay Of Punicke walles, the Romans pray. Where Carthage fate and his did meete, Each others misery to greete. But soone againe his fortune chang'd, And then vnto his party rang'd The raging scum of Lybick land: Where he did all the Iayles dis-band, And of the Fetters and the Gyues, His Martiall weapons he contriues. But none he gaue a Captaines charge, Vnlesse he could make knowne at large, That hee had done some heynous deed, And at his Campe so sought his meed. O cruell Fates, what day was that, What day that dismall chance begat? That Marius should, with his returne, Victor againe, make Rome to mourne? How proudly then did cruell death Both Lords and Commons reaue of breath? Bloudy Fury.How did the sword about him lay? No breast was free from Murthers way. The Temples human bloud did store, Their pauements stained with the gore. No sex nor age protection gaue: On hoary heads the sword did raue, And sent them headlong to their graue. Nither did they a whit forbeare The silly babes, that newly were But borne, and brought to this worlds light: Their liuing day held not to night. O what could colour their pretents, Against poore harmlesse innocents? But it suffisd their tyranny That they still found out some to dye. So raues this force in cruelty: And he was deem'd a coward slacke, That none but faulty men would wracke. Thus numbers dyed day by day: For now they would not spare to slay The strangers, whom they did not know: But cut their heads their bodies fro. More cruelties.They sham'd to come their Lord before With empty hands, not fil'd with gore. One saue-guard yet for life remaines To those, that such a grace obtaines, As on their knees with vowes submisse, Fell Marius bloudy hand to kisse. O people growne degenerate, From glory of your wonted state! A thousand swords threatning new kindes Of deaths, should not debase your mindes. By such meanes to prolong your dayes, As doth so foule dishonor raise. And yet you did but life adiurne, Vntill that Sylla do returne. Few liue this common bane to mourne. Scarcely shall any one remaine, That saw when thou O Bebius slaine, wer't into mangled morsels cut, Noble Romans slaughtered. Their bloudy thirsting blades to glut. Or yet, O Antony, to tell Of thee, that didst presage too well These fatall harmes, how thy graue head (with milke-white lockes all ouer-spread) Was from the murthered body tore, And (by a furious souldier bore Dropping and smoking all in gore) Was on the Table set, in iest, Where Marius kept his solemne feast. Nor how the Crassies corpes in scorne, By Timbria were hackt and torne. And how the awfull Rostrums beake, Soyled with Tribunes bloud did reake. And Scœuola thy age doth plaine, To be so murdered in disdaine, Where Vesta's sacred Temple stands, By their life-violating hands. Those fires that alwayes burne so cleere Murder in Vesta's Temple. With thy bloud somewhat tainted were: Yet thy old veines could yeeld small store, But spar'd those flames from quenching gore. The seuenth time now is come in date, That Marius takes his Consuls state. Such was the manner of his life, No man with Fortune had more strife, And none her fauours found more rife. Marius ch?ge of fortunes. Who better then his course should range, Then he that oft had try'd such change? How many other bodies slaine The streets of Sacroportum baine? What heapes of carcasses all hewd, Before Collina gates were strewd? And now at last the whole worlds head (She whose high power all Nations dread) Must be depriu'd of supreme grace, And chang'd vnto another place. And Samnium now the world must know, Shall giue to Rome a greater blow; Then when her Army forced was Vnder the Caudium forkes to passe. Reuenging Sylla now comes in, And monstrous slaughters doe begin: Sylla's raging time of crueltie.For that small store which did remaine, Of bloud, he searcheth euery vaine. And whilst he doth in shew pretend Corrupted humors to amend, The medcines rage did more offend. His hand to deep doth search the wound, Cutting of those were faultlesse found, And onely those were left to liue, That to his mischife helpe would giue. Then spleene did lawlesse leaue obtaine, That head-strong wrath on law shold raigne. VVhich power was not to one design'd, But vnto euery murtherous minde. So will did all things loose and binde. The liberty that was giuen to out-rage.Seruants and slaues (with balefull blades) Their maisters bowels now inuades: Children likewise their hands did staine VVith bloud of their owne parents slaine: And striue some meed for it to gaine. So did the brothers in likewise, Of bloud fraternall make their prize. Vnto the Tombes some frighted fled, The sundry meanes that men make to dye, so to auoid the disdaine of Syllas insolencies.The quicke were mingled with the dead. None safe-guard seeke in sauage coates: Some hang themselues: some cut their throats Others againe (short worke to make) Their neckes and limbes in peeces brake, By falling to the ground from high, Scorning by murdrous hands to dye. Others againe doe now desire To make a pile for funerall fire, VVounding themselues to that intent, And ere their life-bloud was out-spent, Into the flames their bodies cast, And laid them there whilst strength did last. The heads of Peeres were borne the whiles About the trembling streets on piles, And in the Forum there lye throwne. No villany is left vnknowne, All horrid acts are boasting blowne. The Thracian tyrant Dyomede Neuer saw bloud more rifely shed, Floting in his Bistonian stalles, Nor carkasses about the walles Of huge Antæus Lybicke caue: Nor Greece to more laments it draue, To see the heads of worthy men Dight the Picean bloudy den. Now though the heapes of gored clots, And tract of time disfiguring blots The knowledge of the faces slaine; Sad parents yet would not refraine, By stealth to get (if they could pry) Their childrens limbes where they did lye. And I my selfe can call to minde, That then I much desir'd to finde An old mans report of Syllas time. Mine owne deare brothers mangled head, That there lay slaughtred mongst the dead. VVhereby to giue it funerall, And fires (although deny'd to all) VVhen as I saw the rage decrease Of Sylla's sword, reputed peace; Then heaps of Trunkes abroad I spread, To see which fitted with his head. VVhat should I here at large relate, How Catulus ghost was expiate, VVhen Marius (hackt and tortured) For sacrifice was offered To his vnsatiable Tombe, By an vn-heard-of cruell doome. A Marian cruelly tortured by Sylla's Executioners.Whereas perhaps the wrathlesse spright Did not affect that horrid sight; VVhich we beheld when his crusht bones VVith ioynt from ioynt was wrackt at once. VVhen he as many wounds did beare As members in his body were. And yet no mortall stroke of sword VVould him desired end affoord. VVhich manner of a cruell death Too long defer'd his latest breath. His hands hewd off, fell from the stumpes, His tongue out-torn, then trembling iumps. Vnable to expresse a voyce, His weasan pipe roares out a noyse. One pares his eares from off his head, Another doth his nostrels shred: VVhilst he the whiles (poore tortured soule) On these rent parts his eyes did rowle. And then (to glut their tyrannies) From out his head they pluckt his eyes. Hardly may credit vs assure, That life could so much paine endure. So (with the fall of ruines heft) Are bones and members crusht and cleft: And so deform'd in tempests drown'd Vpon the rockes are bodies found. VVhat fruit or pleasure could they take This wofull spectacle to make Of Marius vgly mangled face? Forsooth they knew they should gain grace To shew it Sylla in that case. Now comes in Prænestina's turne, For her inhabitants to mourne: VVhom she beheld (all at a trice) To pay the bloudy sword like price. Then quailed were th' Hesperian flowers, And Latium youths now death deuours: Then loathsome streame from bodies slaine, The pleasant fields of Rome distaine, Where gallants in their owne bloud baine. Not Famines rage, nor wrackes of seas, Not Earthquakes dreads, nor Plagues t'apease Rome did neuer by any meanes suffer so great desolation as by Marius and Sylla. The Heauens wrath; nor bloudy Warres, Euer gaue vs such deadly scarres. For now the heapes of bodies dead The murderers sway so pestered, That they lackt roome to fetch the blow, When they would hewing wounds bestow. And when that any one was slaine, He could not fall flat on the plaine: The dead did reeling them sustaine. But slaughters came at last so thicke, That bodies dead stifle the quicke. Nothing at all these horrid facts, Sylla's vnmated minde distracts; Sylla beholds the slaughters without any remorse. But from his Turrets top doth eye (Without remorse) those swarmes that dye And carelesse heares their clamorous cry. The Tyrrhen gulfe at last receiues Millions (whom death to it bequeaues) Of Syllane slaughters, whose torne limmes, At first vpon the Tyber swimmes: But at the last twas heapt so high, That bodies did on bodies lye: So as the boats were stopt their course, And Tybers streames were bard their sourse. For heaps of limmes that thither flocke, Damb'd vp the riuer like a locke. But that part next vnto the seas, Had liberty to take his vease. And that which was the heapes behinde, The clustred carkasses did binde. Tyber stopt of his course with the infinite number of slaine bodies. Nathlesse the torrents of the bloud Did force a way, and with his floud, Aboue the Tyber strand did rise, And ouer all the fields it flies. So as the streames of bloud gaue vent Vnto the River, that was pent. The bankes could not this floud withstand, Which cast the bodies on the land. And thence into the Tyrrhene maine, The bloud did fall with such a traine, That her blew waues it did diuide Into a sanguine colour dy'd. Were these the meanes to mend amisse? Was Sylla, Fœlix nam'd for this? A speech of scorne against Sylla.Is this the merit he doth yeeld, To haue his Tombe in Martius field? These mischiefes must be borne againe, This warre will follow that same vaine Of ciuill strife; I feare this curse To fall at last from bad to worse. For where two armed factions meets, Mankinde with common bane it greets. The Marian rage did onely tend His exil'd state but to amend: So Rome receiues him as a frend. And Sylla did no more desire, But to reuenge his quenchlesse ire With bloudy ruine of all those That were of party with his foes. But Fortune calles these Captaines twaine The feare and doubt that this ciuill warre will bring a worse euent then the factions of Marius and Sylla.(I doubt me) to a higher straine. These both in Armes are stout and strong, And will together rush ere long. The others raisd no ciuill strife, And Sylla tooke a priuate life. So did this graue old sire lament His mindfull woes of time fore-spent, Fearing this ciuill warres euent. And yet no feare a place could finde In noble Brutus valiant minde, This staggering dread that mazed all, Brutus constancy and courage.His constant heart could not appall. But ere the dawning of the day, When Parrhasis did downeward sway The oblique Axels of her waine, And did the drowsie skies refraine. Vnto the little lodge he hies, Where Cato his deare Vnkle lies; And at his wicket lowd he rapt, Whom he found not in slumbers wrapt: But tossing (in his carefull mood) The fortunes of the common good, And safety of the Cities state, Which he more wey'd then his owne fate: Then thus with him he did debate. O matchlesse Truth, and vndefil'd, Brutus speech to Cato. Which all the world hath now exil'd! O Vertue, whilome in request, Now onely lodg'd in thy iust breast. Which no worlds fortunes thence can wrest Affoord thy graue aduice to me, Settle my thoughts that wauering be; And (with thy iudgement sound and stout) Direct me now that am in doubt. Some now on Cæsars side will warre: Others of Pompeyes party are; But reuerend Cato, or else none, Shall Brutus Captaine be alone. And whether thou resolued art (In these fraile times) to stay from Mart, Or that thy minde be not dismaid, One of these selfe-wild guides to aid: And that thou deeme this ciuill strife, worthy the waging of thy life? I do not know; but others all Respects to wicked Armes doe call. Some for their filed houses cause: Some that in peace feare Iustice lawes: Others their staru'd estate to mend, To spoyles and ciuill rapine tend: And many banckrouts (drownd in debts) In troubled streames would cast their nets. None take vp Armes with good intent, But all for hope of profit bent. Onely thy selfe no humor drawes To warres, but for thy Countries cause. What can it now tend to thy praise To haue vprightly spent thy dayes? So fraught with vertue, free from crimes, In these our vice-corrupted times? If thou at last this censure haue, Thy honest minde so to depraue? That others were corrupt before (In these vile warres) thy armes had bore. But now thy selfe, this strife accurst Hath made as faulty as the worst. But I beseech the Gods aboue, That from thy heart they so remoue The humor of this mood vnmilde, That with it thou be not defil'de: And that thy armes thou doe not straine To cast the Pile, with might and maine, In clouds amongst the common rout; And so great valour spend in doubt. For in these warres if any erre, The blame on thee they will conferre: And those whom others bring to bane, Thy sword therewith they will prophane, And make thee author of all harmes, That in this ciuill discord swarmes. Peace better with thy temper sorts, Exempt from enuies false reports. Like as the heauenly bodies sway With true and milde vnchanging way, The aire (that to the earth is next) With thunders rage is most perplext: Whilst windes earth plants doth ouercast, And lightning flashes do them blast: Olympus 'boue the clouds stands fast. It is ordain'd by Ioues high hest, That discord should small things infest: But concord highest states hath blest. How would it Cæsars eares content, That such a Peere, as thou, wert bent To yeeld thy selfe vnto the warres, And be partaker of these iarres? For if thou Pompey's part do take, He would thereof aduantage make, And please himselfe withall to thinke, Cato at Ciuill warres doth winke. The Senate for the greatest part, And Consuls likewise range their Mart, Now vnderneath a priuate head, And many other Lords so lead; To whom adde Cato to the rest, A Souldier vnder Pompeys hest, So Cæsars power shall be increast. For then will he sway all alone, That in his Campe compeere hath none. But if our Armes we needs must take, For Lawes defence, and Countries sake, Brutus to neither part will goe, As Pompeys friend, or Cæsars foe: But which of them shall victor stand, Him Brutus meanes to take in hand. So ends his speech; To whom againe Cato replies, with sober vaine; And from the secrets of his breast, Like Oracles these words exprest. O Brutus, needs we must confesse, Most heynously they doe trangresse, Cato's answere to Brutus. That wilfully raise ciuill warre, Which thought be euer from vs farre. But whither fates doe men constraine, Thither may Vertue safely traine. Let heauen, for me, beare all the blame, If I amisse my course doe frame. For who can view (with dreadlesse eye) The falling of the starry sky? Or else containe his helping hands, If he in doubt and danger stands To be ore-whelmed with the fall Of earths grosse weight, and this vaste all? Or that the aire on flaming fire, Our present ruine did conspire? Shall vnknowne Nations parties take With factions that the Romans make? Shall Kings, from Clymes remote so farre, Assisting be vnto our warre? And shall I hold an idle place? Farre from me be a minde so base! These bloudy broyles like to ensue, Might moue the Dakes and Getes to view Our hard mishaps; and yet shall I Carelesse let Rome her fortune try? Or rather as the parent showes His tender loue, that mourning goes (Accompaned with many frends) His childs sad funerals intends; When Nature doth his heart enforce Vnto the graue to guide the corse; And then with sorrow takes in hand To fire the stack with blazing brand. No otherwise can I remoue From thee (O Rome) my loyall loue, Whilst that my limbes with life do moue, And liberty thy name embrace, Or thy vaine shadow in thy place. But let the world goe how it will, And let the wrathfull Gods vp fill The full amends for Romes offence, In this Warre with our blouds expence; No drop thereof will we defraud, But if my wish yee would applaud, O powers of heauen and hell, vouchsafe To cast the burthen of this scath Alone vpon my wretched head. No hostile harmes the Decij fled, To free their Countrey hard bestead. Let both the Armies me inclose, Let all the barbarous ruthlesse foes Of Rhene, on me bestow their blowes. Yea let my body beare the scarres Of all the wounds giuen in these warres. My limbes thereto I would bequeaue, And willingly them all receaue. And happy would my death esteeme The peoples wracke so to redeeme. Could sacrifice of my bloud spilt, Propitiate the Roman guilt? Why doe the people fondly throng To Tyrants, that our State would wrong, And willingly the thraldome trust Of kingly raignes, proud and vniust? O let me witting onely feele The fury of the murthering steele! Let me that still haue beene afraid To violate what Iustice said, And thus in vaine haue lawes obaid. O let this throat be caru'd in twaine, If peace by it we may obtaine, And giue an end vnto those broyles Which now th' Hesperian nation toyles! For if with me these warres had end, No man would Monarchy intend. But as it is warres we must make, And Pompey for our leader take. And all our force and courage bend, The publicke standard to defend. For I assuredly doe know If Pompey giue the ouerthrow; He is of minde too iust and meeke Supreme command alone to seeke, But doth such tyranny dislike. To make him victor Il'e be one: He shall not claime the baies alone. Thus Cato spake; whose feeling words (Like pricking neelds, or points of swords) Stir'd vp stout Brutus martiall ire, And his yong bloud doth set on fire, Too much on Ciuill warres desire. By this time Phœbus shining bright, With beames had chast the chilly night. When all the house did ringing sound Martia, Cato's old wife returnes to his house againe. With blowes, that from the gate rebound, Giuen by modest Martia's hand, Who mournfully without did stand, But newly thither come withall From her Hortensius funerall. That whilome (in her virgins state) Was spoused to a better mate. And now againe she was inlarg'd From nuptiall bonds, and vowes discharg'd. Which for a time she did fulfill, So to obey her Cato's will. And fruitfully her children boare, Wherewith two houses she did store. And then with child she was conceiu'd, When first Hortensius her receiu'd. But after she (with funerall fire,) Had paid his bones their latest hire: And ashes in the Vrna plac'd, With mournfull cheere, and looke defac'd, Her haires about her shoulders spread, Sprinkled with cinders of the dead, Beating her breast with mournfull cry, No presence to delight the eye. Thus she her heauie tale began. Martias speech to Cato.Whilst youths pure bloud through my veines ran, And I (repleat with fruitfull seed) Obayd the hest by thee decreed, Yeelding my selfe to husbands twaine, Posterity to both did gaine. But now with paines maternall worne, And weake with many children borne, With thee I seeke my dayes to spend, Fit else for none to wedlockes end. Restore me to thy loue againe, That neuer did thy bed distaine, And (to content my wretched life) Affoord me but the name of Wife. That my sad Tombe this stile may beare, Cato's true Martia resteth here. So that the wrong of future time, Slander me not with blamelesse crime, And deeme I had defil'd thy bed: Because I did Hortensius wed. When well thou knowst, in thy iust minde, I was thereto by thee design'd: Yet seeke I not to be thy mate, Thereby to liue in better state, Or to enioy a life of ease: To share thy cares me best will please. Part in thy trauels I desire, To campe with thee shall be my hire: Should I in peace and safety shrowd, Whilst that Cornelia so hath vowd To follow Pompeys ciuill warre? Doe not my loue such grace debarre. These faithfull words so won the man, That though the time vnfit were than, Whilst strife and tumults were in date, Martia againe married to Cato. To enter into wedlockes state: Yet they agreed, the knot was ty'd; But solemne pompe was laid aside. The Matrimoniall bond alone Suffisd to make the nuptials knowne: All Ceremonies they forbeare; Onely the Gods their witnesse weare. The Porch with Garlands was not dight, What Ceremonies Cato would haue at his wedding. The Pillars want silke-ribbone white, No Tapers lent a flaming light: No stately steps of Ivory Ioyn'd to the bed where they should lye: The Curtens and the Couerlets No gold embrodery besets: No matron there, with crowne of state, To guard the bride till it were late, From companing her spoused mate: No vaile of lawne did hide or grace; Martias attire. Her modest lookes, and bashfull face: Her mantle that did loosely flye, No faire imbossed belt did tye: Rich Carkanets her necke had none, Set out with pearle, and pretious stone; But from her shoulders there did traile Downe to her waste a simple vaile; These dolefull weeds her state did waile. But as she did her children beare In sorrow, and in doubtfull feare, Such now her spousall pleasures were. And ouer all her purple gowne, A mourning mantle trailed downe: No melody, nor musickes voyce Did with these nuptials reioyce: Nor suiting with the Sabines trade: No solemne feasts at all were made: Her Stoicke husband them forbade. No children then the house did grace, No kins-folkes flockt vnto the place: The match they made vp secretly, Suffisd with Brutus company. The Bride-groome had long time deferd The description of Cato and his manner of life.To cut or shaue his wilde growne beard: It ouer-spred his reuerend face, In his sad lookes no mirth tooke place. For when he first did vnderstand, That Faction furiously did band; Vnshorne he left his hairy head, Vnkemb'd his rugged brow to spread. And in like sort about his face, His shaggy beard did dangling trace. He thought it fit that some iust minde, (Vnto no partiall mood inclin'd) Should waile this rage in humane kinde. His recreation was not fed With comfort of a nuptiall bed: Loues vigor now in him lay dead. And (with the common care fore-spent) From troubled thoughts could not relent: This course strict Cato doth content. The modest meane he still intends, And of his actions casts the ends. With Natures lawes he holds no strife, And to his Countrey vowes his life. He doth not thinke that he was borne His owne state onely to adorne: But that he is in duty ty'd, And zeale, to all the world beside. His dainties were but hungers stay: Large Palaces he did not way: But that sound structure that did hold Out Summers heat, and Winters cold. And neuer in the pompe exceedes Of garments, or of costly weedes: But as the custome old did beare, When Roman Quirites vsd to weare Gownes, made of wouen shaggy heare. He lent no lust to Venery, But to maintaine posterity. He Father was, and Husband sworne Vnto his Citty, now forlorne. Iustice most strictly hee obserues, From honest faith he neuer swerues. Voluptuous life he did detest, It could not breed in Cato's breast. Now Pompey, and his gathred Troopes Pompey hauing forsaken Rome, comes to Capua. Of Souldiers, that with terror droopes, To Capua's walles themselues betake, And there their randevous doe make. A Towne built by the Troian race, Where they a Collonie did place. This for a seat of warre he chose, And in the Countrey round bestowes His bands, and Cohorts to withstand The force of Cæsar, now at hand. Here are those hilles of Apenine, That in the midst run like a line Alongst the whole Italian land, Where these vmbragious mountaines stand, The mounts Apenins. Towring their lofty toppes a high; None to Olympus comes more nigh. This tracke of hilles (betweene two maines) Iust in the midst his race out-straines. The higher and the lower deepes, These hilles conioyn'd a sunder keepes. On this side doth the Pisan land The rage of Tyrrhene seas withstand. On th' other side Anconas soyle Makes the Dalmatian flouds recoyle. These mountaines in their bowels breeds Many springs heads, that Riuers feeds: Which diuersly their streames conuart Into both seas on either part. Metaurus swift, on the left side Names of sundry riuers that flow from the Apenius.And fierce Crustumium thence doe glide: With Senna, and Isapis waues, Isaurus walles that mildly laues: Then Aufidus, that takes his vease Into the Adriaticke seas: Eridanus, that roots vp woods, And sweepes them with his swelling floods, And (from the faire Hesperian lands) Conuayes them to the Oceans strands; This Riuer (as old lawes suppose) With poplar shades did first enclose, And crowne his banks with circling rowes, Phaetons flames.When Phaeton (out of the way, Leading his blazing Carre astray) Did set on fire the aire and sky, The earth did singe, and waters dry; Whilst yet this riuers flowing streames Held tacke against those burning beames: And doth maintaine as broad a course, As Nylus, with his seuen-fold sourse: Except when Nylus ouer-bounds The Lybicke and Ægiptian grounds: Nor lesse then Istar; but when as He doth through many Nations passe, And other streames vnto him takes, That to the seas their progresse makes: Whereby alone he doth not pay His tribute to the Scythian bay, Now from this mountaines steepe right side First doth the Riuer Tyber glide: And high-bankt Rutuba withall: Vulturnus likewise with swift fall: And Sarnus, from whose muddy lists The aire about is stuft with mists: And Lyris that the prouince trades Of sweet Maurica, clad with shades, Whose backe Vestinus water lades: And Syler, that through Salerne floates: With Macra, that will beare no boates, But doth dis-boage into those deepes, That by the Citty Luna sweepes. These mountaines (as they longer streach) Their tops withall doe higher reach Towards the confines of faire France, And on the Alpes their prospect glance, The Vmbrians and the Marsians soyle, VVhere the Sabellian plowes doe toile. So do these Pine-treed hilles embrace The coasts of Latiums ancient race; And neuer leaues th' Hesperian ground, Till Sycils seas their limits bound. Yet long agoe did further wend, And to Lacinia's Temple tend; Vntill such time as her confines (By seas encroach) their length declines. For Italy to Sycill ioyn'd, Before the double seas purloyn'd The land away, and cut the shore, That earst was fixt vnto Pelore. Cæsar in Armes with furies sway, Not without bloud will shape his way. Cæsars humor and expedition. Hesperians he accounts his foes, And would not gaine them without blowes, Least in that kinde he being slacke, Might leaue a warre behinde his backe. Those gates more please him that withstand, Then those set open to his hand. Best sorting are to his desire Those Countries won with sword and fire, Then such as would his peace acquire. He scornes to march through beaten waies, Or to deserue a Patriots praise. At the first beginning of the warre the Citties of Italy stood wauering to which side to inclineThe Latine Citties yet repine, And doubt which way they should incline: For though at first they stood at gaze, When as the warre began to blaze; Yet now their walles they fortifie With Ramparts, and with Bulwarkes hye, And cast about them ditches deepe; Then to the Towers, and Turrets steepe, Round stones of hugye weight they bring, And darts amongst the foes to fling. The vulgar do more affect Pompey then Cæsar.The vulgar most to Pompey bends; Yet with their loue their feare contends. Like as when whistling Southerne winde (Vnto tempestuous stormes inclin'd) Shoouing the seas before his blast, The rowling billowes follow fast, Although that Æols changing hand From his vast caue do them dis-band; And Easterne gale, that checkes the maine, Whose puffes the very Racke doth straine: The sea his first voage yet doth trace, And still the Southerne winde imbrace. So dread these men in doubt did hold, Their faith so fortune bought and sold. Libo flyes from his charge.And Libo first (with base dismay) Hytruria naked left a pray. Pompeyes great Commanders flie from their garisons before they saw the enemy. Thermus (with his example led) Left Vmbria guardlesse, and thence fled. So Sylla (with opprobrious shame, Forgetfull of his Fathers fame) Sylla flies from his charge.Trembled to heare but Cæsars name. Varus likewise himselfe inlarg'd, Varus flies fr? Auximium.And all the garrison discharg'd, That in Auximium he had plac'd, Ere any foe the walles had fac'd; Out at posterne gate he rides, And in the woods and mountaines hides. Lentulus forsooke Æsculea his garrison. Æsculea, Lentulus forsooke, And vnto flight himselfe betooke. But him the Victor did pursue, Making them turne againe that flue; And of so many armed bands, Onely the leader scap't his hands: No Ensignes mongst those Cohorts stands. And Scypio thou too soone didst leaue Scipio forsook Nuceria, that was man'd with a braue garrison of Roman Veterans. Nuceria, that their state bequeaue Vnto thy trust, which so did faile, Ere any force did them assaile; When as that warlike Towne was man'd With many a gallant trained band Of valiant youths, from Cæsars armes, Cal'd to relieue the Parthian harmes. But first imploy'd on Pompey's cost, To venge the bloud in Gallia lost. And now himselfe doth warres intend, For these stout troopes againe did send, To be his father-in-lawes sure guards: This vse of Roman bloud awards. But thou Corfinium, strong-fenc'd hould, Commanded by Domitius bould, That with huge walles inuiron'd art, With Flankes and Ramparts, fit for Mart; Thy garrison were those new bands, That Milo tooke from Iustice hands. Now from the walles (with watchfull eyes) Domitius first neere hand espies Great clouds of dust aloft to rise. And with the glittering sun-shine beames, Faire armed Troopes cast flaming streames. Souldiers &amp; friends, quoth he, make haste, This bridge forthwith must be laid waste, Domitius speech to his garrison Souldiers. That doth vpon this riuer stand: See it be razed out of hand. And you huge mountaines now let flie Your fountaine heads, and raise so hye The flowing Riuers with rough tides, That all the boats that thereon glides, Vpon the shelues may wracke their sides: Stay here the limits of this warre, This Towne their proud attempt shall barre: And on these bankes those rauening bands (With hopeles gains) shal make their stands. Here first shall Cæsars force desist, And victory yeeld to our fist. He said no more, but hastes withall, The swaggring troopes from off the wall, That headlong to the worke doe fall. VVhen Cæsar from his Campe perceiu'd The Riuers passage was bereau'd, And that the breaking of the bridge, Cæsars words at the siege of Corfinium.His iournies speed would much abridge; Enrag'd with wrath: what now? quoth he, Are not strong walles esteem'd to be Sufficient sculking dennes to hide These crauen Souldiers terrifide? O cowards will you ouer-flow The fields, thereby my march to slow? VVhen Ganges with his stickle sway, Nor any other floud can stay Cæsar, from holding on his way; Now he the Rubicon hath past, Yee troopes of horse set forth with hast: And bands of foot come follow on, This shaken bridge goe set vpon. No sooner he the word did speake, But out his forward horsemen breake, And doe the riuers bankes assaile, Like to a stormy drift of haile. To th' other side then they let flye A showre of darts, that cloud the skye. And Cæsars selfe the passage takes, VVhere none to him resistance makes. Then quickly he doth force them all To make retrait within the wall. And then the Rammes for battery Vnto the worke he doth apply. VVith other Engines brought in place, That Towers and Bul-warkes will deface. But see the villany of warre! The garrison the gates vnbarre, Domitius deliuered to Cæsar by his owne men. Their Gouernour they doe betray, And him a prisoner forth conuay, Before proud Cæsars feet to lay. But yet his state and noble face It seem'd no terror did imbase: For oft he stoutly cal'd for death; The Victor knew he loathed breath, As one that did despaire of life. But Cæsar said; Our grace is rife: Liue therefore though against thy will; Cæsars words to Domitius his prisoner. And by our gift (said he) liue still. Let others (whom I shall subdue) In thee a perfect patterne view Of Cæsars mercy; and now chuse, On whose side thou thy Armes wilt vse: Or if thou wilt retired liue, Thy choyce to thee I freely giue. But doe not thinke this moues my minde, That I thereby like grace would finde, If thou hereafter conquest gaine; That base respect I much disdaine. Thus said; forthwith he gaue in charge His hands from fetters to inlarge. But better much had him bety'd, If he that present houre had dy'd: And Fortune more had freed from shame The honour of the Roman name. He holds it now a grieuous scorne (With reputation so forlorne) To warre for his deere Countries sake, And therein Pompey's part to take; Whom all the Senates forces aides, Whilst hostile pardon him vpbraides. Domitius his inward troubled thoughts These thoughts his heart doe still infest, And with himselfe doth thus contest: Shall I in Rome goe make my nest, And (as a man degenerate) Shut vp my selfe in peacefull state? And not this noble warre pursue, That wisht for death, so lately due? Nay rather into hazards runne, Vntill thy lifes twist be out-spunne, And Cæsars gift with glory shunne. Report did not as yet relate This Captaines base subdued state To Pompeys eares fraught full of cares, For his designes that now prepares To strength his part with forraigne shares, And order giues the following day, With Trumpets sound to set in ray His troopes, and then to feele their minde How they to battaile were enclinde. To whom, when they did silence make, With reuerend voyce he thus bespake. Pompeys oration to his souldiers.Yee vengers iust of guilty hands, Yee Souldiers of right Roman bands, That for defence of Iustice stands, Whom now the Senates supreme hest Doth not with priuate armes inuest; Dispose your forward hearts for fight, Since now Hesperia (in our sight) Doth flame on fire in wretched state, And her faire fields depopulate. This clew of rage (in Gallia spunne) Ouer the yeie Alpes is runne, And Cæsar in this raging mood, Pollutes his sword with Latium blood. The Gods him iustly charge with blame, As Author of this ciuill flame. And now euen now Rome to me calles, Whom she her president installes) To chastise these rebellious brawles. Whose armes (with countries bloud defil'd) Cannot as worthy warres by stil'd: To ours that honoured name belongs, Hee compares Cæsar to Cataline.That doe reuenge our Countries wrongs. His warre is of no better kinde, Then that which Cataline design'd, When Rome he meant to set on fire, And had with him that did conspire One of the Lentulij his mates, Cæthegus, bare-arm'd in debates. The house of the Cæthegi vsed alwayes to fight bare Armed. O wretched rage that so dost raigne Within this leaders wilfull braine, Whom Fates would raise to no lesse fame, Then those of the Camillan name! Or those braue Lords Metellij hight. But thou art of another spright: Thy humor followes iust the straine Of Cinna's and of Marius vaine: Whose infamies doe still remaine. Like Lepidus that was supprest By Catull', or as we distrest Proud Carbo, that (by Iustice hest) Our Axes fatall edges try'd, Whose bones Sycilia soyle doth hide. Or as Sertorius, iustly slaine Sertorius. For his rebellious course in Spaine. Although in faith it grieues me much So to compare with any such Thee Cæsar; but that Romes offence Cannot with our reuenge dispence. But would it had beene so ordain'd That Crassus victory had gain'd Against the Parthes, and from the coast Of Scythia, brought againe his hoast; Whereby he might thy selfe subdue, As Spartacus he ouerthrew. Or if the all fore-seeing eye Will that we two our forces try; Spartacus a Rebell. My arme as well as thine shall show, That it the pearcing Pile can throw. And that my bloud, for courage bold, Disdaines by thee to be controld. And that a heart to peace inclin'd, Is not therefore of cowards kinde. Pompeys ostentation recounting all his owne great deeds. For though he tearme me spent with yeares, Let not my age put you in feares. My Campe experience so shall guide, As fits an ancient leader try'd. Let his be ordered by the sway Of a yong Captaines heady way; I haue arriu'd to highest place That free-men gaine by peoples grace: And haue all honours palmes possest, But Monarchy, which I detest. He (whom ambition so doth feed, A vaine-glorious speech.That Pompeys power he would exceed, In swaying of the Roman state) Affects more then a priuate fate. The Roman Peeres this Campe doe grace, The Consuls here doe hold their place. Shall Cæsars pride them all out-face? O Fortune! can it thus betide, That thou so blindly things should guide, And shamelesse tollerate such pride? Because that he (in ten yeares space) Had neare subdu'd the Gallicke race, Where he so long a time hath war'd, Pompey chargeth Cæsar to haue fled from the Brittons.And oft from Rhenes cold banke beene scard, And laid the fault vpon the deepes, That with such rage their channell sweepes As no shippes there safe harbour keepes; Thereby his dastard flight to cloake From Brittons, whom he did prouoke. But now, since he doth proudly boast, That (at the fame of his fierce host) The Senate left their homes for dread, And from the armed Citty fled; A poore excuse.Vaine foole, for feare they fled not thee, But for good will all followed me; That haue my glittering streamers showd Through all the Seas, with pyrates strowd, And did those Rouers force to seeke, Their refuge, in a little creeke. I likewise did, with conquering hand, Subdue the Soueraigne of that land, That Romans force did long withstand: And made an end of Pontus warre, More blest thereby then Sylla farre. No part of all the world is free, But hath beene conquered by me. The cold North streames of Phasidos My powerfull hand and conquest knowes, With Ægypts parching sands besides, And Syen, whom no shadow hides: My name is fearfull to the west, And Spaine likewise I haue supprest: Where Bætis riuer last of all, Into the Ocean sea doth fall. Arabia conquered felt my hands, And fierce Ænochians warlike bands. Colchos renownd with fleece of gold, And Capadocia I controld. The Iewes, the vnknowne God that serue, And dainty Sophens that preserue Themselues so choyce; th' Armenians, The Taurynes, and Sylicians: All these are vanquished by me, And nothing from my hands left free: Pompey recounts his actions. But Ciuill warres vnweldy heft, Which to my father-in-law I left. Thus Pompey did his mind make knowne, Whereat no showts of ioy were showne. Neither seem'd they much to desire Pompeys Souldiers but little mou'd with his great words. The Trumpet kindling Martiall ire. And he himselfe (dismaid at this) The Bands and Ensignes doth dismisse. Not trusting to his staggering troopes, That basely so halfe-conquered droopes, To heare the sound of Cæsars fame, Before that he a neere them came: Pompey's men amazed at the fame of Cæsar. And therefore would not hazard fight VVith cohorts in that daunted plight. But as a Bull his lease forsakes, VVhen he a foyle in combate takes, Into some groue, and desart wood, Doth range and runne with furious mood. In which mad plight, (with rage repleat) With hoofe and horns the shrubs doth beat, And to his pasture comes no more, Vntill his strength he doe restore. And his rug'd necke, and furrow'd hide Please him againe with puft vp pride; Doth then at last returne againe, And more insult ore all the plaine; Leading the heard with him to goe, Whether the heards-man will or no. So Pompeys force (too weake for fight) Leaues Italie to Cæsars spight. And (like a sculking run-away) Doth through Apulia roaue and stray, Till at Brundusium he arriues, The which strong fortresse him reuiues. Pompey comes to Brundusium.This Towne of old was first possest, By a strange Collony distrest, That were as banisht men out-cast. From Creet, and through the Ocean vast Conuay'd by ships of Athens state, (As ancient fables doe relate) When Theseus did blacke sailes aduance, Breading false feare of his mischance. This part of Italie doth show An indraught, compast like a bow, In midst whereof a peece of land (Form'd like a tongue out-stretcht) doth stand Which bow the Adriaticke maine, Brundusium described.With horned compasse, doth containe. And yet thereby ships could not finde A harbour safe from euery winde; But that an Iland of high rockes Safe from the storme, this indraught blocks: And doth repell the raging waues, When so the stormy tempests raues. And here and there, on euery side, Nature doth safely so prouide, That boats and ships may safely ride, But by a little Cable ty'd. And thence they may free passage take; If they a voyage meane to make, For the Corcyrian Iland bound; Or else would seke their anchor ground On the Ilyrian left-side lands, Where Epidamnus Citty stands. Here also oft sea-faring men Their tempest-driuen ships vp pen, When Adriaticke stormes arise, Or on Ceraunia cloudy skies: Or when Calabrias Sason shores, With foaming billowes swelles and roares. When Pompey now did plainly finde Assurance none remaind behinde His backe, in Italies affaire, Nor that he could himselfe prepare To turne the warre another way For Spaine, where his chiefe forces lay: Because the Alpes were iust betweene And from that course debar'd him cleane; His sonne vnto him he doth call, That eldest was amongst them all: And him commands the world to try, Pompey his words to his eldest sonne, whom hee sends for aids. For aid whereon he might rely. Search Euphrates and Nylus shore, To whom our fame was spred of yore: And all those Nations draw to head, Where I haue Roman Armies led: With all those Pyrates vanquished, Whom I in Collonies did spred A briefe Catalogue of the nations that aid Pompey. Throughout the large Cylician soile, Bid them vnto the seas recoyle. Stirre vp with all the Pharaoh's King: Let my Tygranes his force bring; But therewithall haue speciall care, Pharnaces doe his armes prepare, With both Armenians wandring rout, And Pontus people warlicke stout: Together with Ryphæan bands, And those that coast alongst the strands Of slow Meotis lake, thicke frorne, Whereon the Scythian Carts are borne. But what, my sonne, needs many words? Bid all the East now whet their swords, And Citties all where so they stand That haue beene conquered by our hand: And to my Campe summon them all, That to my Tryumphes haue beene thrall. Pompeys words to the Roman Lords at Brundusium.And you likewise, braue Latium Lords, Whose names our Holy-dayes records, First to Epyrus get you gone; Then through the Grecian fields march on: In Macedon new force receiue, Whilst winters season lends vs leaue. When he had said, they all agreed To follow what he had decreed: And that there might no time be lost, They hoise their sailes, and leaue the coast. But Cæsar not enduring peace, Nor liking long from Armes to cease, Cæsar followes Pompey close at the heeles.Least Fortune should estrange her face, Still hotly doth pursue the chase, And presseth Pompey at the heeles, As one that no contentment feeles, In ought that yet by him is done: That hath so many Cities wonne In so short time; and hath distrest So many foes, of Forts possest: And finding Rome, the worlds chiefe head, So easie to his conquest lead, The greatest prize that warre could gaine: Yet Cæsar (in his maistering vaine) With nothing done contents his minde, Cæsars humor.VVhil'st ought to doe remaines behinde. But onward in this warre doth trace, Though all Italia giues him place: And much at Pompey's state repines, That he should rest in her confines. And no lesse doth it him displease, That he should passe from thence by seas: The Hauens mouth he striues to shut, And therein heapes of rockes doth glut. Cæsar goes about to shut vp the Hauen of Brundusium to keepe in Pompey from flying away. But that his labour lost in vaine, Swallowd by the deuouring maine. And like the sands are spearst abroad, Faster then hands can them vnload. For of those heapes no marke was seene More then if Athos mount had beene Orethrowne, and in the middle cast Of the Egæan Ocean vast. Or as if Gaurus hill so steepe VVere into the deuouring deepe Of foule Auernus headlong throwne: So this huge worke was ouerflowne: No signe at all thereof was showne. Now therefore he meanes to assay Another course to stop the bay. VVith piles of wood (hereto design'd) The like was vsed by the Spaniards before Antwerpe, which they tearmed a Stockade. And huge Oke trees with chains combin'd, This harbours mouth must be confin'd. So fame reports that Zerxes tryd, The raging seas to ouerstride, Framing on Hellespont a way, Ouer the which he would conuay Zerxes. From Asias side his mighty hoast, Vnto Europas fertill coast. And on this floting bridge transport Old Abydos to Sestus fort. Not fearing to be ouer-cast VVith Eurus, or with Zephirs blast, VVhen he through Athos forc'd a way, Safely his Nauy to imbay. So was this harbours mouth chain'd fast VVith woods cut downe into it cast; VVhereon they did large Towers aduance, That on the rowling billowes dance. VVhen Pompey now at last perceiu'd The out-let of the sea bereau'd; VVith firme compact foundation wrought VVhereby the worke to passe was brought, A world of cares torment his thought, How to set free the bay againe, And sparse these workes into the maine. He therefore now stout shippes prouides, (With hoised sailes, and force of tides) Against this linked bridge to rush, P?pey forceth away through Cæsars worke before the harbour.Which with huge Engines they doe crush, So that peece-meale it teares and splits, And on the weltring Ocean flits: In cliffes and rockes lye linked trees. Thus for his ships a passage frees. And in the darke (with force of flings) Great wilde-fire balles amongst them flings. Then he commands, in still of night, That all prepare themselues for flight. That Mariners no clamours make; When to their shippes they them betake: Nor that the Trumpets warning giue, When they their watches doe relieue. But that the troopes doe come aboord, Not thereto cal'd by Trumpets woord. It seemes Lucan is heere mistaken, for that this beginning of the war was in the Spring of the yeare, as Appian writeth.The Sunne in Libra now doth shine On Autumnes Equinoxiall line, When (with the dawning of the day) They doe prepare to packe away, And wey'd their Anchors with no cries, That in the oase deepe buried lies. And whilst they hoise their tackled yards, The fearfull Maisters silence guards. They cut their sailes, and cables coyle, Pompey leaues Brundusium, &amp; flies by sea in the night.The Sailers without noise doe toile. Then Pompey Fortune did desire, That now he safely might retire From Italy; since she design'd, That he no resting there should finde: But seem'd it did the Fates displease; For (with the working of the seas) The shippes pell-mell incumbred were. Which did a sudden clamor reare. And falling foule (with blustring weather) Their beake-heads clattring meet together. The enemy the Citty takes, As soone as Pompey it forsakes. The Townsmen straight set ope the gates. So faith doth change when fortune mates. The walles they had no sooner wonne, But straight the armed troopes doe runne To both ends of this compast land, Which at the harbours mouth doth stand. And much were vext to looke thereon, How Pompey with his fleet was gone. O shame! a little conquest 'tis, To see great Pompey flying this. He slipt out at a narrow breach, A reproch to Pompey. And so the Ocean wide did reach: This breach by which his ships did passe, Through this huge worke, no bigger was Then the Eubæan straight, whereon There beates the waues of Calcydon. And here two of these ships stooke fast, Into the which these Souldiers cast Huge grapling hooks, with mighty chains, That them vnto the shore constraines. Here ciuill bloud the sea first staines. The whole fleet else free passage finde; But these chiefe ships were left behinde. Euen so when Iason tooke in hand, First to attempt the Colchos land; Cyanea's cliffe let fall two rockes Into the sea, whose boysterous shockes One of his lesser vessels hits, Whose sterne abaft it somewhat splits: Yet safely from those rockes she flits Into a sheltring creeke, and theare Her wracke forthwith she doth repare. By this the breaking of the day A differing colour doth display: Yet Phœbus (with his glistering head) Had not Aurora's cheekes made red, Though his approach drew on a pace: To which the nearer starres giue place. The Pleiades no longer shines: Boötes to the East inclines: The greater starres that shine by night, And Lucifer, that lampe of light, Hides from the heate of Tytans sight. Now Pompey through the seas doth scower, But not with like Empiring power, As when he did those Pirates foyle, That all the maine did robbe and spoyle. Thy fortunes haue their race out runne, Tired with thy great conquests wonne. So as mishap thee now doth call, With thy deere spouse and children all, Into a warre farre off to flee, And all thy houshold Gods with thee. And yet (in this exiled fate) A noble traine supports thy state. But oh some forraigne shore is sought, Whereas thy ruine must be wrought. Not that the Gods in wrath desire, That thou shouldst want thy funerall fire Vntomb'd in thine owne natiue land; But with thy death curse Ægypt strand: And free that heynous wretched deed From Latium, that thy worth did breed. For her so Fortune doth prouide, In coasts remote that guilt to hide. To keepe the Roman land from staine Of bloud, of her deere Pompey slaine. Finis Libri secundi. The third Booke. The Argvment. This doth declare Whilst Pompey flees, The vision that he dreaming sees. To Sicill Ile is Curio sent, Cæsar to Rome makes his descent. The Treasurie as spoyle he takes, Metellus some resistance makes. In these warres who takes Pompey's Part. Cæsar to Spaine transferres his Mart, And in his passage takes in hand Marseilles siege by sea and land. Yet onwards still he doth proceed, And leaueth Brutus in his steed: Who by a battell on the Maine With conquest doth the Citty gaine. With friendly gales the sailes doe flye, Whilst through the deepes the ships doe plye; And all their lookes as they doe wend, Vpon Ionias coast they bend. Pompey flying by sea, still casts his eyes toward Italy. But Pompey's eyes still fixed stand, Gazing on the Hesperian land, And whilst he viewes his natiue shore, (Which he is like to see no more) The high lands seeme as clouds to sight, And then at last doe vanish quite. Now whil'st a slumbring sleepe did ceaze His wearied sprights, to giue them ease; In dreames, a vision he descries, That from below did gastly rise. The sad aspect of Iulias face, Pompeys vision in a dreame on the sea, &amp; Iulias speech to him.Seem'd to appeare in that same place, Whereas her funerall fire was made, And said, I come from Stygian shade, Where ghosts afflicted haunt and trade, Chac'd from those faire Elisian fields, To blessed soules that solace yeelds. Constraind I follow ciuill warre, Where I beheld the Furies iarre, Sparkling abroad their blazing brands Amongst thy troopes of armed bands. And Charon, Ferry-man of Hell, More skiffes prepares then tongue can tell. And Dis new torments doth deuise For soules, that posting to him flies. And now the Fatall Sisters try, With all their speed, their worke to ply. Yet their three hands can scarce suffise, Their webbes so fast in sunder flies. O Pompey! whil'st I was thy wife, In Triumphes thou didst lead thy life: Thy Fortune since, it seemes, it fled, Cleane chang'd with thy new nuptiall bed, Which is ordain'd (by wrathfull Fates) To bring her Pheeres to dolefull dates. Cornelia, that same strumpet vile, That did her spousall bed defile, Before the funerall fires were spent, Wherein her husbands bones were brent. She still thy Ensignes doth accost, By land or sea where so thou gost. Whilst, me in memory to keepe, Thou wilt not breake one houres sleep. No vacant time there doth remaine, Your mutuall loue-sports to restraine. But Cæsar shall thee chase by day, And I by night will thee dismay. Læthe from me cannot remoue The memory of thy deere loue. The powers infernall licence me Throughout the earth to follow thee. Amidst the fierce batalions rage, I dreadlesse will my selfe ingage. For by my ghost I doe protest, Within thy power it shall not rest, (O Pompey) that stile to prophane Of Sonne-in-law, which thou hast tane. Thou seekst in vaine with thy swords edge To cut the knot of that vowd pledge. Doe what thou canst, these Ciuill harmes At last shall cast thee in mine armes. Thus hauing said, the wandring shade From the embracements softly fade, Of her old spouse, herewith adrade: Yet though the Gods his ruine threats, And ghosts would moue him to regreats, The fiercer he to armes doth flye, Resolu'd his fatall chance to try. What now (quoth he) shall slumbring sights Pompeys words hauing seene the vision. Of visions vaine, appall our sprights? Either the bodies laid in graue Of mortals here, no feeling haue: Or nothing 'tis when death doth raue. By this time Tytan dipt his head Downe into Thetis azur'd bed: And onely so much light he lends Vnto the Earth, as Phœbe sends From her pale face, with hornes new clos'd, Or when her orbe hath beene compos'd. Now this desired stranger coast, Affoords him leaue to land his hoast: And to that end they did prepare Their Anchors, and their Cables yare. And as they doe approch the shoares, They strike their sailes, and ply their oares. When Cæsar saw that from the bay The windes had borne the fleet away, Cæsar discontent with Pompeis escapeWhich now the seas hid from his sight, Although his onely power and might Commanded all Hesperia soyle; No glory yet in him did boyle, So to put Pompey to that foyle. But did his minde much more displease, That so his foes had scap't by seas. Fortune by no meanes could content The height whereto his minde was bent: He weyes not so much conquests gaine, As still in raging warres to raigne. And yet now seemes that he doth meane, From care of warres his thoughts to weane: And to intend the publicke peace; Hoping by that meanes to encrease The peoples vaine vnconstant loue, And discontentments to remoue. Cæsar affects to winne the peoples' fauor.Which to effect, the grateful'st way Was how the common dearth to stay: For now the Cities, and the rest Famine most grieuously opprest. Then Awe, and Loue are surest bread, When by the rich the poore are fed, The starued vulgar nothing dread. Curio therefore to this intent, Curio sent into Sycilia.Into Sycilia Ile is sent: Whereas the seas with furious waues, Either the mouldring shores still shaues, Or else the clyffes so beates and shakes, As in the land great indraughts makes. And still their fury so maintaine As keepes the parted confines twaine That they can neuer ioyne againe. Now rage of warre (but new begunne) Doth ouer all Sardinia runne. Both of which Ilands still abound With fertill croppes vpon the ground; Sycilias fruitfulnesse, So as no coast on all that maine Hesperia serues with so much graine. The Roman barnes no land so feeds, Scarcely the stalkes the eares exceeds. Not Affricke doth affoord like store; When as the clouds, with Boreas rore, Breeds fruitful years, and moists the shore. Thus Cæsar did, with care prouide How these defects might be suply'd: Then marcheth on (with stately port) But not in any warlicke sort: His countenance seem'd to peace design'd, And so to Rome his course enclin'd. O had he come vnto that Towne, Only adorn'd with the renowne, Cæsar comes to Rome, And Trophies of the Gallicke spoyles, And glory of his Northerne broyles, How great a traine, what worthy showes Might he haue made of conquered foes? Of all his Rhene and Ocean thralles, His conquest of the noble Gaules, And with them all his captiue flockes, Of Brittons, with their yellow lockes. O what a triumph did he leese, In winning more then all of these! The Cities now as he remoues, Did not (in troopes to shew their loues) Meet him with shouts and friendly cries: Cæsar not applauded by the Citties, as he past towards Rome. But silent, and with fearfull eyes. No flockes of people in the fields To see him there, applauses yeelds: Yet his contentment stands in this, That he to them a terror is. For he did euer more approue The peoples feare, then their vaine loue. Now he the steepy Towres had past Of strong Anxuris, and at last The fennie way withall he takes, That lies between Pontinas lakes: Neere which the groue aloft is seene, Of Diane, Scythians heauenly Queene. And not farre thence, high Albas way, Where Latium rites make Holiday. From whence vpon a rocke on hye, A loofe, the Citty he did eye: Which (since his Gallicke warre began) He neuer yet had seene till than. And now (admiring that prospect) To Rome this speech he did direct. Cæsars speech looking vpon Rome.O seate of Gods! could this men so Forsake thee, ere they saw a foe? If thou canst not, what Citty can Deserue to be fought for by man? Well haue the higher powers represt, The humors of the armed East, From ioyning with the Hungars stout: And all that fierce outragious rout Of Dakes, of Getes, and Sarmatans, From bringing downe their bloudy bands To thee (poore Rome) by Fortune spar'd, Whom fearefull Pompey durst not guard. So weakely mand, more blest art farre With Ciuill then with Forraigne warre. Thus said, forthwith he did invest The Citty, then with feares possest: For sure they thought, that (in his ire) All should haue beene consum'd with fire, Cæsar is not so cruell as the Romans suspected.And Temples should to ruine runne, As soone as hee the walles had wonne. Such was the measure of their fright, His will they constru'd by his might. And in such sudden mazements weare, That they their sacred rites forbeare. The common sort to sportings bent, Their merry tunes turn'd to lament: No spleen they had, their sprights were spent The Roman Fathers reuerend troope In Phœbus Pallace sitting, droope: Not thither called at an houre, By order of the Senates powre. No Consuls with their presence grace Their sacred seates in supreme place. Nor next to them the lawes to sway The Prætor sate in his array. No Coches at the Senate gate, That thither bring the Peeres of state. Cæsar alone was all in all, Cæsars great authority in Rome. His priuate voyce the Court doth thrall. The Fathers to his hests giue way, Rady his pleasure to obay. Whether he Monarchy desire, Or would to sacred rites aspire: Or liues of Senators would wast, Or them into exile would cast. But he (more modest and more milde) Cæsars modesty. Did blush his power should be defil'd; More to command (with threatning feare) Then well the Roman state could beare. But one there was amongst the rest, For liberty that would contest: And in a rage he tooke in hand, To know if Cæsar might withstand Metellus a Roman Tribune contests with Cæsar. The ancient Rules of their free state, And in that point would right debate. This stout Metellus was, who saw A swarming troope of Souldiers draw Neere to Saturnus Temple gates, That were lockt vp from dire debates, Steps forth enrag'd, and doth assay Through Cæsars bands to force a way. So much of tempting gold the loue Metellus would protect the Treasury of Rome from Cæsars spoyle. The mindes of mortall men can moue, Danger of sword and death to proue. The lawes no Valor doth protect, The care thereof all do neglect. But (that which is most vile of all) Riches, whereto base mindes are thrall, Stirres vp a foolish idle brawle. This Tribune, with a tongue at large, The out-rage laies to Cæsars charge: And telles him plainly that before He shall breake ope the Temple dore, The sword should first his breast inuade, And bathe in sacred bloud his blade. And that the Gods for iustice sake, Vengance would pay if spoyle he make, Or doe by force the treasure take. The Tribunes curses in like case (Said he) did greedy Crassus trace. And did against him so preuaile, That wofull warre his pride did quaile. Doe thou so now vnsheath thy sword, That dost such lawlesse leaue affoord To this iniurious foule contempt From peoples rage thou art exempt. What can this forlorne towne attempt? Thy wicked Souldiers must not craue, The treasures of our state to haue: Else-where thou hast sufficient spoyles Of conquered Townes in other soyles. No want at all thy troopes constraines, Of our long peace to share the gaines: In warre (O Cæsar) loose the raines. With these proud words the Tribune hath So farre prouoked Cæsars wrath, As that with scorne he did reply; Cæsars words to Metellus the Tribune.In vaine poore soule thou hop'st to dye So braue a death, as by my blade: Nought hath Metellus worthy made, So great a grace as Cæsars ire, It sorts not with thy proud desire. Thinkst thou that freedoms state must stand Supported by thy feeble hand? My glory wonne in so long warre, Thy vaine conceipt exceeds so farre, As that the lawes would lesse detest, By Cæsars hand to be supprest, Then by Metellus voyce to hold, The freedome that they did of old. So Cæsar spake, and yet before The Tribune left the Temple dore, His rage increased more and more. And to the wrathfull swords he prest, Forgetting what his gowne profest. But Cotta check't, and staied than, Cotta's discreet words to Metellus. The sawcy boldnesse of this man. And said; the freedome now they held, To soueraigne power in spight must yeeld. For though this act thou couldst maintaine, Thou shouldst but freedomes shadow gaine. Since our deiected state obayes So many other seruile wayes. This comfort and excuse we haue, If slander vs as base depraue. Resistlesse power doth all men braue. And I would rather wish to heare, These seedes of warre dispersed weare. With losse of wealth those may be vext, That freedome haue for their pretext. For want more grieuously doth raue Vpon the maister then the slaue. Metellus being put aside, The Temple was set open wide: And such a noyse the rushing shockes Did make, when they did force the lockes, That the Tarpeian cliffe did sound, Lowd with the Eccho's that rebound. Out of the Temple cleane they swept The wealth, that had full safe beene kept The treasures of Rome taken by Cæsar. So long agoe by conquests gain'd, Whereof scarce memory remain'd. The treasures got in Punicke broyles, The Persian, and Macedons spoyles; With heapes of gold, that were a pray, When Pirrhus trembling fled away, A Catalogue of those places from whence the Roman treasures came That had Fabritius faith assay'd, In vaine our Rome to haue betraid. And whatsoeuer heretofore Our frugall sires laid vp in store: With all the tribute and the rent, From time to time that Asia sent: And all the spoyles from Creta fot, By conquest that Metellus got: With Cato's wealth, which he did bring (By long seas) from the Cyprus King: With all the treasures of the east, And those rare Trophies that did feast The eyes of all that them beheld, When Pompeys triumphes so exceld: And was the latest conquest wonne On those great kingdomes ouer-runne. All these the Victors vse supplies By wofull rapine made good prize. Cæsar richer then all Rome.Whereon might truly passe this doome, Cæsar was richer now then Rome. Pompey meane while a world had wonne, That would in warre his fortune runne: Great Cities on his side did band, The aids that came to Pompey.That shall at Cæsars mercy stand. The Græcians first their succour lends: Amphisa her braue Phoceans sends; Then those that doe the Countries fill, On both sides of Parnassus hill; With rocky Cyrrha, to him swarmes The Captaines of Boetian Armes. Where Cephisos, with his swift waues, Old Cadmus Citty weltring laues. Whose water fatall answeres raues. To these, Pisean people ioynes: With sweet Alpheus, that purloynes Her secret current vnder ground, Till she Trinacria hath found. Menala then th' Arcadians leaue, And to these warres themselues bequeaue: And Trachine Souldiers thither flye, From the Herculean Oeten hye: The Thesprotes and Driopes Doe likewise march along with ease. The Sellæ, that his part doe take, Their solitary groues forsake, That on Chaonians toppe doe shake. And though th' Athænian bands were spent In former warres whereto they went, Yet loyall Salamina lent Three little shippes, which now they rigge, That in Phœbeian docks did ligge. The ancient Creet, Ioues loued land, Where Citties ten times ten did stand, Her Gnossian quiuers thither sent, With people vsing bowes euent: Gortinæ shewes the like good will, Whose Archers equals Easterne skill. Then Orithow sent Dardan strength: With Athamus that farre in length Disperseth many woods she ownes. And old Enchyle, where the stones Shew Cadmus metamorphoz'd bones. So Colchis, and Absirtos flud, Whose froth filles Adriaticke mud. The Pæni, that (with clownish skill) The Countries all about there till. And with Thessalian Plowes doe toyle, And furrough vp Hialcons soyle. From whence (into the raging maine) Was carried first that stranger traine, Of Argonauts, whose boysterous bands Did range and spoyle in forraine lands. They first the practise did contriue, How men against the seas might striue. And how with sailes to take the winde, Whereby remoted shores to finde. And therewithall they did display To loathsome Death a new found way, On mortals liues to raue and pray. The Thracian Æmus is left bare: And Pholoe, whose manrood are (As lying fables leaue to minde) By nature shap't of Centaurs kinde. Strymon (that doth to Nylus sands Send birds of the Bistonian lands) Her aid sets out in warlicke bands: And barbarous Cone, when she leaues Sarmatian streames, and after cleaues To Peucens spreading channell deepe, One of those heads alone doth keepe, That from great Istars current sweepe: Then Misia and Idalis land, That mingles with cold Caicos strand, And the Arisban barren mould, With those that doe Pitanen hould; Then the Celenes most accurst, Lamenting that their Marsia durst (O Pallas with thy gifts elate) Stirre conquering Phœbus to debate. And high shoar'd Marsia whose swift race, Crooked Meander doth embrace, And with her, wheeles about her pace. With Pactols sands, that do vnfold, The pretious graines of glowing gold To forraigne coasts, and Hernius strands, That equals it with pretious sands. So likewise all the Ilium bands, To fruitlesse warres for Pompey stands. Neglecting the old flying fame, Cæsar supposed to bee come of the Troians.That Iulius of the Troians came. So Syria her assistance giues, And the inhabitants that liues About Orontes desart coasts, And Ninus towne, whose blisse fame boasts: Damascus subiect to high windes: Gaza likewise; and where men findes Palme-trees so rife, and thicke to stand, Named the Idumean land: The Tyrians &amp; Sidonians skilfull sea-men.The sea-washt Citty Tyrus hight, Sydon with pretious purple dight, Their ships (when to the warres they flye) Range not the seas vncertainly. No sea-men haue the Art more try'd, How by the Pole their course to guide. So likewise (if we credit fame) Phœnicians were the first had name, The Phœnitians the first that inuented letters. The vse of characters to finde, And letters to expresse our minde. Memphis the practise had not found Of those broad flagges vpon her ground, How they together should be bound. The Memphites kept their magicke art carued in stones, with the figurs of Beasts and Birds before they knew letters. Of beasts and birds (this was their trade) The shapes deepe cut in stones they made. And so their magicke art presaru'd In brutish Images faire caru'd. Then those inhabitants that roues About mount Taurus wooddy groues. And Persian Tarsus, with those men, That cut rockes for Coricum denn. The Mallians, and the Æge coast, Whose shippes doe ring with billowes tost. And Silix now the seas frequent These were the Pirats that Pompey conquered, and triumphed for long befor the ciuill war began. Allowd, but not as Pyrates sent. So are the Easterne Countries led Vnto this warre by fame farre spread. That Ganges now her troopes forth brings, The current of whose floating springs Of all streames in the world dares runne, A course contrary to the Sunne; And headlong flies against the East, Ganges runnes his course c?trary to the Sunne. Heere it is said the warfare ceast, That Macedons great Captaine made, When he the Ocean did invade. And did himselfe ore-come confesse With this vast worlds vnweldnesse. There Indus fiercely forth doth sweepe, The place where Alexander ended his warre. With mighty streames, and channels deepe, Diuided into gulfes alone, But with Hidaspis mingles none. Then those that the sweet liquor swilles, Which from the sugar-canes distilles: A people that doe paint and adorne their haire with Iewels. And they that vse with saffrons graine, To giue their haire a shining staine. And so in dainty lawnes doe dangle, Which they with glistering Iewels spangle. And those that make their funerall piles, Before that Death their Life exiles. And doe without constraint embrace, The furious flames with dreadlesse face. A people that do burn themselues, and not attend their natural death.O how great glory doe they gaine, That death can hold in such disdaine, With their owne hands (in spight of fates) To hasten on their welcome dates; And whilst in perfect health they liue, Their soules vnto the Gods do giue! Then those fierce Capadocian lads Whom hunting humors so much glads, A hunting nation.With bruske Ammannian plowing swads: Armenia, where Nyphatem flowes, And rowles huge pebbles as she goes, With the Coastra forrests hye, Whose lofty toppes doe threat the skye. And yee Arabians (that doe view An vncoth clime vnknowne to you) Do wonder much the shade to see Streame from the left side of a tree. Then came vnto this Roman warre Th' Orestians, that doe dwell a farre: The leaders of Carmania bands, Whose climate to the Southward stands, Not wholly hid from Arctons light, But see his Carre part of the night. And Æthiop neere to all the signes, That in the cirkling Zodiaque twines. Excepting Taurus clouen heeles, When cowring crookedly he reeles. And where great Euphrates is bred With swift stream'd Tygris from one head, In Persian fountaine ioyntly fed. Who when they mingle here and there, Breeds doubt which of the names they beare But Euphrates (with fruitfull streames, As she doth trauerse sundry realmes) Resembles Nylus in her course. But Tygris in her rapid sourse, The riuer Tygris runnes a great way vnder the ground and then rises againe. Is suddenly deuoured quite, Into the earth from all mens sight, And vnder ground doth runne her race Till with new head her streame she trace, And with the Ocean enterlace. This while the Parthians held them coy, Either to helpe or to annoy, Any of these two mighty guides, The Parthians refused to ioyne either with Cæsar or Pompey, but laugh and looke on. They'l warre on none of both their sides: But laugh which way the world it slides. The wandring Scyths, with poysned darts, Their aid vnto this warre imparts. And Bactrians closd with chilly gulfes, VVith Hircane forrests fostring wolfes. Then the Henochians bring their band, A part of Lacedemon land. That headstrong are where they withstand And of Sarmatia all that track, That ioynes to Mosko backe to back. And where rich Phasis cuts and bounds The Colchos fields, and fruitfull grounds. VVith Halis bringing heauy fate To Cræsus, in his rich estate. And where as Tannais tumbling downe His streames, from off Rypheus crowne. Giues vnto Nations sundry names, As she her winding channels frames. And Europe doth on either side, From Asia with her bankes diuide. Now here, now there, which way she bends, The limits of the world extends. And where the Euxine sea doth take Huge torrents from Meotis lake, And so the glory doth abate Of Gades, whom (as tales relate) Did onely through her pillars twaine, Hercules Pillars set vp at Gades. That way let in the westerne maine, VVrought by the huge Herculean paine. Then aids come from Scythonian ports, With whom the Arimasps consorts. The delicacy of the Arimaspes.Those doe with golden phillets dresse Their curled lockes, and combed tresse. The Axij, Pompey's part professe, With Massagets, that did let blood, Their horses hoofes in steed of food, So to releieue their hungry mood, The Massagets in their warres for want of victuals let their horses bloud, &amp; so relieued themselues.In the Sarmatick lingring brawle, And Gelons swiftest of them all, So huge a masse of Martiall bands Came not from the Memnonian lands, When Cyrus did his armies make, For warres that he had vndertake. Nor Zerxes with his boysterous crew That all his thousands onely knew By counting of the darts they threw. Nor Agamemnons nauy strong, Which to reuenge his brothers wrong, With Græcian Princes past the seas, In number euer equal'd these. The variety of Nations, Languages and attires that were in Pompeys campe.So many Kings to battaile prest, Neuer obay'd one Chiefetaines hest. Such diuers formes of habites strange, Of language such confused change, So great a traine of royall Peeres Was neuer seene in former yeares, As Fortune now did lead in dance, To mingle with this warres mischance. Like funerals for Pompey's sake A fitting exequie to make. Iupiter Hammon.Then Corniger, that Hammon hight, Did not forbeare with supreme might, To summon all Marmatick lands Vnto these warres to leade their bands. Or whatsoeuer force did rest Euen from the furthest of the west, Of parching Lybs, and sun-burnt Moores; Together with the Easterne powers, As farre as Paratonia strands, Vnto the bounds of Syrtes sands. That Cæsars fortune yet may know He had not wonne all at a blow: But should in the Pharsalian fields Incounter worlds with speares and shields. Now Cæsar following on his Mart, Cæsar takes his iourney from Rome towards Spaine. From trembling Rome he doth depart: And (with his valiant expert host) Ouer the cloud-brow'd Alpes doth post. And whilst that other Citties feare, The thundring fame of him to heare, Massilian youthes dare take in hand, As Neuters in these warres to stand. The courage of the Massilians. Not with Greeke lightnesse vnresolu'd, But with a constant courage bold, They doe entend for to debate The lawes and freedome of their state, And not to change or follow fate. But yet before they do engage Their Cittie vnto battailes rage, They will attempt (with all their skill) To qualifie his head-strong will With courteous and perswasiue words, And not till need vnsheath their swords. Now therefore when they vnderstand That Cæsars force was neere at hand, Embassadors to him were sent, Who with them Oliue branches hent, To shew that peace was their intent. Your Latium Annals doe make knowne Massilia still such faith hath showne The Oration of the Massilians to Cæsar. Vnto the reuerend Roman state, As that in all the dire debate, That they haue had with forraigne foes, She hath partaked with their blowes. And now if thou doe vndertake, Conquests in vnknowne Climes to make, Massiliians offer to aid Cæsar in forraigne warres, but not to intermeddle in this ciuill strife. Command our true deuoted hands, To warre with thee in forraigne lands. But if yee (with infestious Armes) Prepared are for discords harmes, To ciuill warres, then giue vs leaue Our teares in secret to bequeaue. Against all piety it stands, In bloud of friends to bath our hands. But if the Gods (to wroth inclin'd) VVith venging arms would shew their mind, Or if the earth-bred Gyants fell, Against high heauens would rebell, Yet humane duty should not dare VVith an inferior bootlesse care, Either by treaty, or by might, To offer for the Gods to fight. Little can we poore mortals gesse VVhat humors higher powers possesse: VVhen Ioue from high his anger wreakes, He thunder-bolts and lightning speakes. Admit that many nations strange, Amongst these broyles their forces range. And that the sottish vulgar sort VVould this contagious crime support, And not repine (constrain'd from farre) To whet their swords for ciuill warre; Yet be it farre from honest hearts A reprehension of this ciuil warre.To follow any factious parts. Let no braue Souldiers venter life, To bolster out domesticke strife. VVhat hand would not with feare be taint, To see his wounded father faint? Brothers that warre on either parts, VVill doubt to throw their fatall darts. And sure your Empires state will end, The summe of the Massilians Petition to Cæsar.If warres vniust you doe intend. But now our suite we doe commend, VVhich is, that from our Citty gates, You would with-hold all dire debates; The Massilians offer to receiue Cæsar vnarmed, and without his Troopes.And no infestious Ensignes send, Nor Egles fierce vs to offend; But that as to your friends most iust Your person with our walles would trust. VVhere Cæsar may (deuoid of doubt) Assure himselfe his armes shut out. Our Towne is free from enuies wroth To Cæsar and to Pompey both. But if that Romes vn-vanquisht state Shall still subsist by fauouring Fate; And that your humors it might please, Your wraths with friendship to appease. Here may you both vnarmed meet, And peaceably each other greet. But if prouoking warres of Spaine, Massilia indiffer?t between Cæsar &amp; Pompey offer their Towne for a place of parly. Your forces thither doe constraine; Why range you then so farre astray? Our Citty lies not in your way; Whose worth of no importance is, Our state stands still exempt from blisse. We could not earst with happy armes, Defend our selues, and countries harmes. But exil'd made our last retreat From Phocis Towers, our natiue seat; Arriuing in this stranger port, Where we securely raisd a fort, Rounded with walles of no great haigth, The strength of the Massilians consisted in their loyall dealings with their neighbours. But alwayes guarded with our faith. Now if you will besiege our Towne, And teare our gates and ramparts downe, And set our houses on a fire, Spending on vs your hostile ire, Our water-courses turne awry, And all our fountaine heads draw dry, And sucke the moisture from those fields, That fruits and graine vnto vs yeelds. O then behold a loathsome sight, When Famin shall (with rauening plight) Constraine vs for to eate and gnaw Our fleshy limbes to feed our maw; Our liberties we hold so deare, The resolution of the Massilians. That we no toyles nor torments feare. But as Saguntum, with renowne, When Hannibal besieg'd that Towne, Our mothers so, with dried pappes, Will cast their infants from their lappes, Into the fire, to end mishaps. The wife will begge with watery eye Of her deere husbands hand to dye. And mischiefes measure vp to fill, The brother will the brother kill. Such ciuill warre they'le rather make, Then any other vndertake. Thus the Massilian Legats said, Which speech did Cæsar so vpbraid, As that in him it stird vp spleene Which in his very lookes were seene. And in these tearmes exprest his teene. Cæsars answere to the Massilians.Your Græcian race conceiues in vaine, What course we meane to entertaine. For though our iourney seeme to bend Westward for Spaine, yet we may spend And spare sufficient time to boote, To raze your walles vp by the roote. Reioyce my Cohorts, at this hap; Fate casts a warre into your lappe. The blustring windes do loose their grace, When in the vacant aire they trace, If no thicke woods withstand their race. Cæsars Army cannot indure idlenesse.The flaming fire is but a blast, If fewell be not on it cast: So is it noisome vnto me, Without a warring foe to be. My troopes that idle life doe rue, When they meet no rebellious crue, That with their force they may subdue. Cæsar disdains that the Massilians offer him to come disarmed into their Towne, or else to shutte their Gates against him as an enemie. Massilians thinke they offer faire, That Cæsar may vnarm'd repaire In priuate sort safe to their state, Or else they will shut vp their gate: I needs must scorne this double flout, To shut me in, or shut me out. Then they will seeme to banish farre, Contagion of a ciuill warre; But they shall smart in that they dare Intreat of peace in my affaire, And by experience well shall see None are then those more safe and free, That by my armes protected be. So hauing said, his troopes he leades Towards the Towne that nothing dreads, Whose gates were shut, &amp; walles well mand VVith store of youths that on them stand. The siege of Massilia. Not farre from thence Cæsar espies A hill, that loftily did rise. VVhose toppe extends a pretty space, Fit for a little camping place. This he esteem'd a peece of ground, VVhich all their tents might safely bound, Casting a trench about it round. The Cities side next fronting this, A strong and lofty Castle is, VVhose toppe euen with this hill is seene, And then a plaine lies both betweene: VVhere with great labour vp were cast Diuers high mounts with Ramparts vast. But first on all parts to the land, VVhereon the Citty walles did stand, He did inuiron round about VVith trenches and with bulwarkes stout. Cæsar inuirons Massilia with a trench on all sides of the land. And this huge worke so did conuay, That all was shut vp but the bay. How great and eternising fame VVas it vnto this Citties name, That neuer ouer-awd with feare, In this distresse, that now they were, Did still vndaunted courage beare. Seeing that Cæsar had so late Subiected all in so short date, That one towne should oppose his fate. Massilia shews more valor in resisting Cæsar, then all Pompeys townes in Italy. Bootlesse it is that to fore-slow, VVhich Fate sets downe how it shall goe. Fortune, that hastens this mans sway, And saies the world shall him obay, In this but trifles time away. Downe goes the woods hand ouer head, The Okes are from the forrests shred. With which their works of earth are bound, Wherby they stand more firme and sound: That their foundation well may beare The structures that on them they reare, which else their heft wold mouldring teare A Groue there stood full long of yore, Which none durst violate before, Whose armes so thicke did interlace, That it obscured all the place. The description of a strange and hideous groue neere Massilia.And with coole shadowes kept off farre, The glowing beames of Tytans carre. The rurall Nymphes here did not wonne, Nor Syluane Gods, nor Fairies runne: But with a barbarous sacred rite, For sacrifice had Altars dight. The rugged rindes (throughout this wood) Were smer'd and staind with human blood. If we may credit giue to eld, That heauenly powers in reuerence held; The very birds it did affright, Vpon the boughes to pearch or light. The sauadge beasts did it forbeare, And would not haunt or kennell there. No windes on these trees shewd their force, Lightning did thence her flames diuorce. An vgly horrid denne it was, That neither bred greene leafe or grasse. But many swarthy springs there rise, From whence froth-bubling black streams flies: And there rough hewed pictures stands Of Gods, fram'd by some bungling hands. In rotten trunkes of hollow treene, Strange vncoth shapes are often seene. The hideous seate of this sterne place, With dread makes pale the gazers face. Strange sights in this groue.The vsuall figures daily seene Of God-heads, not so fearfull beene, Nor holds mens mindes in so great awe As those they neuer knew or saw. Oft-times from out the hollow ground, Strange howling voyces did resound. Huge Ew-trees sometimes seeme to fall, And straight spring vp againe withall. The fires that run by night in fields, Twining these trees no blasting yeelds. About the Okes fell Dragons twist, Thither to come no people list. Tis left vnto the powers diuine: For be it when the Sunne did shine, Or when darke night the earth doth hide, This should seeme to bee a very melancholy God. The Priest there scarcely durst abide. To meet (in so great feare he stood) The God that patroniz'd this wood. This groue that neere the campe did stand, Must now be feld downe out of hand. Of which in former warres with Gaule, No sticke was euer cut at all; But safe vntoucht did stand vpright, Neere other woods destroyed quite. But yet the Souldiers daring mood, Cæsars Souldiers make scruple to cut this groue. To cut these trees dismaied stood, The reuerent place so cool'd their blood. They thought that if this groue they fell, The Axes edge would then rebell, And in reuenge (as thereto loath) Vpon their limbes turne backe his wroth. When Cæsar saw his Cohorts put In so great dread this groue to cut; He takes an Axe, and fiercely stroake Vpon a mighty high-growne Oake: Cæsar by his own example causeth his Souldiers to cut down this groue. Which when he had halfe hewne a sunder, Why mates (quoth he) is this a wonder? Feare not with me to doe the same, Vpon my head lay all the blame. Which said, they his command attempt: But yet from feare not full exempt. The Souldiers doubtful whether to anger Cæsar or the Gods. Their mindes in doubt were held at oddes, To anger Cæsar, or the Gods. Then downe is feld the long-grain'd Ash, The knotty Holme in twaine they slash. The great Dodonian Beech high-growne, Now with the Axe lies ouer-throwne. The Alder, bred by riuers sides, As did the rest, like wracke betides. The Cypres, vsd by those that mourne, Whilst noble funerals do burne. Then did the place so fleec'd and shorne, In stead of shade, let in the morne: So neere they grew, that being feld, One tree another vpright held. The Gallicke peasants at this sight, The peasants of Gaule grieued to see this groue cut downe. But the Massilians being glad of it.Condole the spoyle with heauy plight. But all the Burgers (from the wall) Reioyce to see this huge down-fall. They hope this sacrilegious deed Against the Gods, would vengeance breed. Yet Fortune oft we see doth spare The mighty that most guilty are. And heauenly powers their fury slakes, In plaging wretched harmlesse snakes. When they had trees sufficient store To serue their turne, they feld no more. But round about they seeke all parts, To bring in carriages and carts: Which did the countrey much annoy, The Gallicke peasants repine that their plowing is hindered by Cæsars carriages.Their plowes in that sort to imploy. This season seru'd the lands to till, And much it went against their will To let their husbandry stand still. Cæsar likewise was much inrag'd, About this siege to be engag'd. His forces were design'd a farre, To be imployd in greater warre, Cæsar offended to be thus staied before Massilia.Against his enemies in Spaine, Whose armies coast the Westerne maine. And therefore to cut off delayes, A woodden Turret he did raise, Of so great height, and large withall, As was the castle and the wall. Cæsar erects Engines against the walles of Massilia. Which was not fixt vnto the ground, But borne vpon huge truckles round. And creeping forward like a snayle, Was not discernd how it did trayle. And when this masse did crackling shake The Townsmen thoght that some Earthquake This hugious structure did surprise, And musd their walles shak't not likewise, The Massilians wonder at Cæsars Tower, to see it goe and shake. Yet still their courage did subsist The Romans stoutly to resist. And not alone with casting darts, But with great slings they pierce both parts Of this huge frame, and make such way, That armed troopes downe-right they slay. And with those maine stones from them cast, When bones are bruisd, and liues laid wast. More wounds they leaue so gaping wide, That darts had way from side to side. Such mighty blowes these stones do giue, As when fierce windes do whirling driue, The Massilians resisting engines Against some old high tottering rocke, VVhich so the cliffe doth teare and shocke, As that on whom the ruines fall, The bruised corpes to death doth sprall, And mingles bloud and ioynts withall. But then to giue them more offence, VVith thicke conioyned Target fence, They do assaile the Citty wall, The walles assaulted by Cæsars souldiers. And to that fight with courage fall. Target to Targe, borne with high hand, One doth behinde another stand. The sides whereof so wide extends, As that their Murrions it defends; And now the darts that cost from farre Their enemies did wound and scarre, Could not preuaile gainst this close fight, But ouer-slipt their bodies quite. Then were the Townsmen new to seeke Some other meanes that were more like The strength of the Romans target-fence.How to offend, which did them paine How to begin to learne againe To vse their darts with fashions strange, And practisd weapons now to change. Therefore (in stead therof) they chose With armes vnarm'd vpon their foes, Huge stones to ding downe from the walles, Whose weight might crush them with their falles. But so firme stood their clustred sheelds, That to those stones no more they yeelds Then toppes of houses breake or faile With whirling showers of ratling haile: Which on the tile stones sound and dance, So from this fence the stones did glance. Yet still the Burgers grew more fierce, And with continuall heaps did pierce This Target-fence, and at the length The Target-fence at last broken, and Souldiers retire.Disioyn'd their strong connexed strength: So as the Cohorts ouer-toyl'd, Seuer'd themselues, and then recoy'ld. But therewithall came new supplies, Who then another Engine tries. Their Vinias to the wall they brought, Couerd with greene turfes all aloft. Whose hollow pent-house sheluing steepe, With an other Engine the walles are begun to be vndermined.Did them from blowes and danger keepe: Then with the Pick-axe and the spade, The walles foundation they inuade, And so began to vndermine, Safely protected with their Vine. The battering Ramme then forth they bring Whose hanging huge heft with a swing The Ramme brought to the walles.Firme couched stones down tottring bring And whilst the force thereof they try, The Burgers heape downe from a hye The Romans retire to their campe, seeing their Engines burnt &amp; spoyled.Such monstrous logs and quenchlesse flames VVith fiered brands to burne these frames. And still these fires doe so renew, That the scorch't flames in sunder flew: VVhereat the Souldiers tyr'd with paine, Seing their labour lost in vaine, Home to their Tents retir'd againe. The Burgers then the Gods did craue, Their Citty walles from wracke to saue. And therewithall with courage stout, Their youths by night did sally out; Pressing vpon the Roman bands, And closely carried in their hands The Massilians sally out, and set fire on the Roman fortifications &amp; engines. Fierce wild-fire balles, which they with slings Amongst the hostile army flings. No other Armes with them they tooke, Their darts for that time they forsooke. Their bended bowes were laid aside, Onely those whorling fires they try'd: Which kindling flame with winde enrag'd, Their campe most desperatly ingag'd. And with such fury did inuade, The workes and Towers that they had made If Cæsar had beene as well resisted by P?peys Captaines in Italy, or by Pompey himselfe in Rome, hee had not found so easie and speedy a conquest. Of wood and timber, though but greene, Yet did the flames so creepe betweene With smouldring heat the ioints and floores That searching fire the boords deuoures. W?? spred abrode such swarth-thick smokes, As that the aire it dampes and chokes. At last this flame was growne so fierce, As that it did not onely pierce Their timber-frames so strong compact, But with like force in sunder crack't The very stones new dig'd from ground, Wherwith their structurs were compound Great spoyle by fire in the Roman Campe So wasting fire did all confound, And these maine ruines ouer-cast In hugenesse farre the workes surpast. The Romans thus distrest by land, Do now resolue to take in hand To try their fortunes on the seas; But not with ships the eye to please, The Romans doe now prepare to attempt the towne by sea. Adorn'd and painted on their sides With formes of Gods their sailes that guides. But rough and rude made vp in haste, Of trees new cut, strong built, and vaste, Compact with knees and timber sure, That seas and tempests would endure. This nauy rig'd, forthwith they guide, Assisted both with winde and tide, The Roman fleet, whereof Decius Brutus was Admirall.Vnto the mouth of Rhodanus, Where being all assembled thus, On Brutus they attendance gaue, Whose ship was stout, high carg'd, &amp; braue. Then hoysing sailes, they rang'd the seas Alongst the shores of Stæcades. The Greeke Massilians in like sort, Prouide themselues within their port: No lesse resolu'd to venter blowes The Massiilians prouide to incounter the Romans on the sea.Vpon the seas, against their foes. And in this minde with courage bold, They man their ships with yong and old. And doe not set out to this fight, Onely those vessels in good plight; But rig'd vp ships decay'd and torne, That in the dockes lay then forlorne. Phœbus no sooner with his beames Glitter'd vpon the Ocean streames, Blunting his darts on Neptunes face, And from the skies the clouds did chase. The North-winds laid, the South-wind still, The seas all calme for fight at will: But they wey'd anchor, and did load Their yards with sailes, and left the roade. Here Cæsars fleet their Oares do plye, There do the Grekes like labour try: And with such sway their strokes they take, As that the very keeles did quake. The lofty ships are drawne on fast, By those that to the fight make haste. The Roman wings composed were The Roman wings on the sea.Of many ships, whereof some beare Three bankes of Oares, and foure some, Others had more the seas to scumme. And with this strength into the deepe They lanch, and crescent order keepe. Whereas Liburnian Gallies goe, With Oares of two bankes and no moe. Yet Brutus Gallion Admirall, With sixe bankes went stoutest of all, Brutus his Gallion. And with long Oares their strokes let fall. When in the maine both of these fleets In battell rang'd together meetes: Confronting with their force so neere, As that their Oares could scarce goe cleere, The battaile on the sea begun. Such shouts and clamors they did make, As that the very aire did shake. And with the voyces that rebound, The clashing of the Oares were drown'd, And did suppresse the Trumpets sound. The rowers then the blew waues teare And on their benches fall and reare, Whilst Oares each other ouer-beare. Their beake heads first together foyne, Then cast about their sternes to ioyne, And did so fast their darts let flye, As that their numbers cloud the skye, And on the sea in heapes did lye. About againe with speed they tacke, Prow against Prow doth shocke and cracke: And many ships scattred abrode Againe relying, lay on loade. As when the Easterne windes oppose The Southerne gales, that sternly blowes. One way with force the billowes sweepes, Another way the current keepes. So in the deepes the Gallies range, Vncertainly with flitting change. For when their Oares haue forward ply'd, Backe are they checkt with winde and tide. But the Massilian gallies are Of saile and stirrage much more yare, The Massilian ships nimble and swift. Nimble and light to leaue or take, And on their staies quicke speed can make. Whereas the Roman steady ships The Roman ships stout, &amp; of deepe draught.With deeper draughts their bottomes dips. And in the seas do vpright stand, As fierce for fight, as on the land. The maister of that Gallion stout, That Admiral'd the Roman rout, Sitting vpon the puppe on hye, From whence he all the course might eye. Brutus stout words to the maister of his Gallion. Brutus to him aloud thus spake. What worke (quoth he) meane you to make? Shall my fleet idle range the coast, That you your marine Art may boast? We hither come prepar'd for fight, Against our foes to shew our might. Come bring vs therefore sword to sword, Lay me the stoutest Greekes aboord. These words of Brutus he obayes, His broad side to the foe he layes. But whosoeuer of the foes Did shocke their sides, or changed blowes Brutus ship stil victorious.With Brutus shippe, him grappling fast, He boords, and ouercame at last. The other Gallies wast to wast, With hookes and chaines doe grapple fast. And by the Oares did hold each other, The fighting ships the seas did smother. But now they doe not make their warre With slings and engines cast a farre. Those deadly wounds the life that parts, Are not from Iron-headed darts. The fury of this sea-fight when the fleets ioyned.But now they buckle hand to hand, The sea-fight doth on sharpe swords stand. The ships aloft are man'd and arm'd, And fist to fist incountring swarm'd. Dead bodies on the hatches fell, Their bloud amongst the waues doe mell In such abundance, that the froth Of clotted gore, made Neptune wroth. And whilst with force their arms they straine To linke themselues with grappling chaine. The bodies slaine in heapes so rides, They cannot ioyne their sides to sides. Some halfe dead sprawling down-right sink, Some their own bloud with salt-waues drink. Others halfe drownd resisting death, Struggling for life with latest breath, VVith timbers from crack't ships that slid, A terrible description of a sea-battle. Out of their paines are quickly rid. And many darts that ouer slips The fight, into the Ocean dips. Missing the markes their force to stay, Embrue their steele another way. Lighting on those that swimming fleet, VVho in the waues new wounds do meet. The Romans now are throughly try'd, Encompast round on euery side. And then the fury of the fight, Straines on the left hand and the right. VVhere whilst that Tagus deales his blowes From his high puppe on Greekish foes, Two dismall darts light on his breast, And steepe their steele deepe in his cheast. So as the bloud did stand in doubt A Roman called Tagus, slain with two wounds. At whether wound it should gush out. Vntill at length the boyling blood, Draue both the darts out with their flood. So life departed with the gore, The wounds did open death a dore. Massilian Telo, wretched wight, The Gally guided to this fight, A better Mariner was none, That had more Art and practise showne Of any ship to finde the trimme, In wrought seas how she best might swimme. Nor better knew his markes a farre, Nor how to take the Sunne and Starre. Telo, an excellent Pilate of the Massilians slaine. Nor better gest which way the winde VVas likeliest to be enclin'd. This maister with his brasse-beake head, Out of a Roman ship had shred A mighty planke; but loe the while, His breast was pierc'd through with a pile. And as this worthy Pilot dy'd, Out of his hand the helme did slide. Gayareus, a Massilian.Then whilst Gayareus Gallicke Greeke, Another shippe doth bordering streeke, And straines to enter her by fight, A Iauelin pierc'd his bowels quite, And to the ship side nailes him fast, VVhere he must hang if steele-head last. Two Massilian brothers twins slaine in this battell whereof one shewed admirable valour.Two brothers did this fight adorne, Twins hard to know, at one birth borne. These glorious testimonies were, Of that rich wombe that did them beare. But sundry fates did them pursue, Though from one self-same root they grew: For one of them in this sterne fight, VVith fatall stroke was reft the light. And him the parents better knew That did suruiue, wanting the view Of him late slaine, of semblant hue, A chance that much lamenting breedes, His halfe-selfe lost, his dolour feeds. This brother that as yet suruiues, Against a Roman Gally striues, VVho though the oares his breast withstand Yet on her side he graspt his hand, Till one dire stroke the hand did reaue, VVhich to his hold still fast did cleaue; Not vtterly depriu'd of sence, True valor increaseth with mis-fortune.Whose ioints wold not be losd from thence Now valor with mishap increast, The noble stumpe more wrath expreast. Stirring vp then his left hands might, To take reuenge of this despight, But as hee stoop't for to recouer The first lost hand, he lost the other; And both into the sea did fall, Slasht from the body arme and all. Thus of his limbes dispoild and wrack't, His Target both and sword he lack't: Yet for all this aloft he bides, And vnder hatches neuer hides. But his bare trunke he did display On his slaine brother where he lay, Whil'st many wounds he did assay. And then as one that life disdaines, Other mens harmes he entertaines; Vntill at last, with wounds opprest, Finding that life would leaue his breast, That little strength that yet remaines He doth collect into his vaines; A reuenging humor strangely exprest. And with that small store of life-blood, He armes his legges, and with fierce mood Into the ship did leaping rush, That with his weight he might her crush. This ship opprest with slaughtered limbes, The bloud about the hatches swimmes: And being crack't with many a crush, That oft a-thwart her ribbes did brush: Her knees were loosd, her ioynts did ope, The leakes in her did giue free scope The waues so fast to sucke and gull, That all her deckes at last were full. Then to the bottome downe she sinkes, A Gally fighting is sunke down-right. Making a gulfe with circling crinkes. The hollow where the ship did ride, That did before the waues diuide, Is now againe with seas supply'd. This day in midst of Thetis lappe Many strange accidents did happe. Then whilst into another ship, The Harping-irons they did slip, Which in her sides their hooks should fixe, In Lycida one of them stickes; Lycida miserably tortured betwixt his foes and his friends. Which would haue hald him ouer-boord, But that his mates their helpe affoord: And by the legges still held him fast, Till he in peeces flew at last; Whereby his bloud dropt not so slow As that which from a wound doth flow: But out at euery broken vaine A streame of crimson gusht amaine. And that which wont was to impart Life to the limbes from out the heart, With that same element was mixt, That earth and aier lies betwixt. Neuer did any dying wight So many wayes breathe out his spright. The lower parts of that torne trunke, Depriu'd of spirits, fainting shrunke. But where the lungs and liuer lies, And noblest parts that heat supplies, That did a while his breath prolong, And still for life did struggle strong. But he with stretching grew so lither, That limbe with limbe scarce held together. Now whilst the fight is fiercely try'd, The Souldiers all runne to that side, Whereas the foes doe thickest stand, And left the other side vnmand. A ship ouerwhelmed by the running of the men all to one side. With which vnequall poise ore-way'd, One ship is topsie-turuy sway'd, And dooth into the Ocean reele, And ouer head turnes vp her keele: Which so oppressed all the swarme, That none could stretch a legge or arme, So was the Mary Rose lost before Portsmouth in a fight against the French in the dayes of Henry the 8.Whereby to swim and saue their liues, And so the sea their breath depriues. Thus death amongst them al doth raue For whilst one youth did striue to saue His life, by swimming on the waue, Two hostile ships together ran, Which 'twixt them bare this haplesse man, And with such force their powers did rush, That flesh and bones together crush. A miserable destiny.The body was not of such proofe, To keepe those ships so farre aloofe: But they so close together fall, That their brasse beakes did ring withall. Herewith his belly being ript Into the panch the water slipt. And at his mouth he powred out His bloud and bowels like a spout. But now the Oares doe backward steere, So as their beake-heads were set cleere: And so this carkasse rent and slit, Vpon the waues did weltring flit. There were beside a hugie rout, That suffering shipwracke swamme about To saue their liues, and to that end Sought for some ship that was a frend. But by mischance they light vpon A Greekish Gally of their fone, The diuers strange aduentures of a sea-fight. Hanging vpon her sides and helme, So thick, that might her ouer-whelme: Wherewith the souldiers then aboord, Hewd off their armes with edge of sword. And left the hands claspt on the sides, From whence their maimed bodies slides. So as they could no more sustaine Themselues, by swimming on the maine. Now in this battailes long euent, Were darts and weapons almost spent. The weapons all spent, what shift was made to offend one another. But fury then prouides for Armes, With Oares now one another harmes. The staues that flagges and Ensignes beare, They from the banners snatch and teare. With benches whereon they did sit, The rowers one another smit, And peeces from the ship sides split. Their fellowes that in heapes lye slaine, Vpon the deckes they search againe, That they their weapons might retaine. Others to shew their dreadlesse hearts, Out of their wounds doe rash the darts, And with their left hands close the sore, So to represse the bubling gore, Which striues that way to finde a vent, Whereas the lance had made a dent. But all this hauocke by the seas, Was not to be compar'd to these, That last of all they did inuent, By a contrary element. For now enrag'd with greater ire, The cruelty of fire in a sea-fight.They cast abrode such desperate fire, Composd of brimstone, pitch and oyle, Wherein their darts they wrap and foyle. And then such wild-fire balles doe make, Whose flames no waters force can slake, But on the ships quicke hold will take: Where they incounter ropes and boords, That tarre and rosin store affoords; Stuffe that will quickly flame retaine, And hard to be extinct againe. The boords that from the ships sides shakes, To auoid fire, some drowned themselues.These fiers hand-fast on them takes. Here some doe plunge into the seas, The scorching flames so to appease. Others to escape drowning aduenture vpon the flames.Others in danger of the waues, Hold by those plankes that flaming raues; So whilst mongst many deaths they runne, No death so much they striu'd to shunne, As that which first they apprehend Any death seemes more easie to men, then that which they most doubt.Did threaten them their liues to end. Yet all these ship-wrackes nought auaile, Their courage to abase or quaile: But on the seas the darts that flow They gather vp, at shippes to throw, With those faint hands that them sustaine, By swimming in the rowling maine. And when they cannot meet with darts, Great malice exprest.Another way they play their parts. When one foe doth another spy, They straight together struggling try, Till both downe to the bottome flye. Amongst the rest in this fierce fight, Phoceus an excellent swimmer and diuer drowned at last.A man there was that Phoceus hight, A Souldier of a gallant spright, That well could swim, and well could diue, And vnder water long suruiue, So as for need the bottomes sands, He would take vp with diuing hands. Or if the Anchors hooke were bound, He could vnloose it from the ground. Or fixe the cable, that by chance From out the Anchors ring did glance. This fellow singles out a foe, And in his armes doth graspe him so, That to the bottome both do goe. There him he strangles in the mud, Then lifts himselfe aboue the floud. But after this againe he tries In semblant sort to diue and rise: And as his head aloft he reares, Against a ship his skull he teares; Wherewith he downe-right sunke amaine, And neuer rose aliue againe. Some now the hostile oares by might Would hold and stay their ships from flight, But that which most did all offend, Was vnreueng'd their liues to end. Many that saw their death draw nye, Would on the ship sides hazards try. And so the beake-head brace and clip, Some that expose their bodies to saue the ships from bruising. To beare the blow from off the ship. Then Lygdanus by chance did eye, Tyrrhenus mounted loftily, Strowting vpon a Gallions puppe, A sling and bullet he takes vp, And sent it with a strength so fierce, Lygdanus. That both his temples it did pierce; From whence a streame of bloud forth flies, And after it starts out his eyes. His sight thus rap't, amaz'd did stand, Tyrrhenus a valiant Roman. And thought this darknes was deaths hand. But when his sprights were come againe That did true valor still retaine; My mates (quoth he) that so well know The piercing dart a farre to throw, Direct me now a right to stand, That I may vse my darting hand. Then to himselfe a lowd he spake, Tyrrhene goe now and vndertake In warre all hazards that may chance, Thy end more brauely to aduance. Such noble thoughts this man halfe slaine Did in his haughty heart retaine. My wel-steel'd dart, Ioue grant thou light Vpon some gallant worthy wight. So said, his dart he forth did straine It seemed that blinde Fortune guided this blinde mans hand.With his blinde arme, yet not in vaine, But did a lusty younker smite, Of noble bloud, he Argus hight. The point his very nauell hit, Argus a noble youth slaine.But pierc'd it not halfe through as yet; Vntill he groueling downe did fall, Which prest the head home shaft and all. When this happe Argus did betide, His father on the other side, Did in a conquer'd Gally stand, Great was his worth by sea and land; For he in all the Phocians warres, Gaue place to none that doing dares. But now with eld was weake and spent, And yet vnto this battaile went; Not as a Souldier to obay, But in high place to rule and sway. Now when this dismall chance he spy'd, Ouer the seats he straines to stride: And so poore man still clambring vp, Made shift to come vnto the puppe: Where when he saw his Argus lye The griefe of a father for his slaine sonne, not exprest by teares, nor cries, but by a resolute death.Gasping for life, at point to dye, No teares fell from the old mans eye, Neither did he outraging cry; But numnesse did his sence surprise, And darknesse did benight his eyes. His body sodainly grew cold, His hands out-stretcht could nothing hold. And in this trance and sencelesse plight, He had forgot his Argus quite. But he sweet youth his head did becke, That faintly reeled on his necke. And lifts it vp a little space, When first he glimpst his fathers face. A lamentable meeting. His Iaw-falne mouth no voyce forth sends, But silent to his father bends; And beckes his head as latest blisse, From his old lippes to get a kisse. And with best meanes he could deuise, Pointed to him to close his eyes. The griping sorrow that did straine This poore old man in euery vaine, Puts rage and spright in him againe. Well now (quoth he) I'le loose no time, This wracke is chanced for my crime. The direfull Fates as they ordaine Shall haue me, by mine owne hand slaine. Old Argus his speech to his dying sonne. Deare Argus my sweet boy dispence With thy sad fathers late offence, In that I did not thee embrace, Nor with last duties kisse thy face. As yet thy wound doth not so draine, The life-blood out of euery vaine, But that thy lookes good hope do giue, That thou a while maist longer liue. No sooner had he said that word, But straight he fell vpon his sword, Which he draue to the very hilt; Yet not content with his bloud spilt, Into the sea he head-long flies, One way to death could not suffice. The old man pursues a double death. This fortune now drawes to an end Which way the victory shall tend. No longer cause there doth remaine, Hazards of battaile to maintaine. Most of Massilian fleet is drownd, The rest for Roman seruice bound. The Massilian ships serue the conquering Romans. Whose rowers when they changed were, The Roman victors in them beare. A few with speed away did flye, For shelter in some harbours nye; The lamentation in MassiliaBut now what tongue can well expresse The Cities fright and heauinesse? How fathers for their sonnes lament, What teares the wailing mothers spent. And how the wiues vpon the shore, In forlorne troopes would search and pore Amongst the waues distain'd with gore: The Massilians affection to their slaine friends.Where they their husbands corps might haue Disfigured weltring in the waue. But often-times their markes did misse, And for a Greeke, a Roman kisse. The fathers with like strife desires To giue their sonnes their funerall fires. Brutus victorious on the sea.But Brutus with triumphant hands, Victor vpon the Ocean stands. And on the sea first purchast fame With victory to Cæsars name. Finis Libritertij. The fourth Booke. The Argvment. Cesar vpon a lofty mount Incamped, doth his foes afront, Neere to Ilerdas stately walles; Where by the rage of water falles Beeing distrest; thence his Cohorts Hee ouer Sicoris transports: And doth Petreius hoast pursue; Where both the Campes a league renew. Which wickedly Petreius brake, And Friendship did with Slaughter slake. His Campe then Cæsar doth inclose, And so opprest his staruing foes, That proud Petreius and his bands Seeke mercy now at Cæsars hands. Meane while Antonius men are slaine Vpon the Adriaticke maine: Whereas Vulteius and his mates, Most gloriously doe end their dates. Then Curio on the Lybicke coast Is ouer-throwne with all his hoast. Fierce Cæsar now in Climes a farre, Doth seriously pursue his warre: And yet his Mart doth mildly wage, Free from reuenge, or bloody rage. Chiefly hee doth affect to see, Of what import these Captaines be; Afranius and Petreius command in Spain for Pompey. Afranius and Petreius were The two that all the sway did beare. The power was equall that they held Ouer the Troopes, in Towne or field: In campe they no precedence haue, Either of them the watch-word gaue. These had besides their Latium bands, Swift Souldiers from Asturian lands: And to them ioyn'd the Vectons light, With all that people that tooke flight From Gaule, to mixe their race with Spaine: VVho Celtiberian name retaine. A place there is that naturally Doth raise it selfe vp loftely; And is a fertile plot of ground, In midst whereof a hillocke round Extends it selfe with ample bound. The Cittie Ilerda.On toppe whereof Ilerda stands, Founded long since by Antique hands: VVhose gallant seat, and stately walles, Are washed with the water falles The Riuer Sicoris.Of pleasant Sicoris, not least Of those sweet streames that Spaine do feast; Shap't like a bow on either sides: A bridge of stone this flood bestrides. And vnto it a rocke is nye, Afranius campVVhere Pompey's men incamped lye: Cæsars Campe.VVhence Cæsars Tents are plainly seene High pitcht vpon a lofty greene; The Riuer runnes the Campes betweene. VVhich field in largenesse doth extend Further then sight can comprehend. And this great Champion circling round The Riuer Cinga.Swift Cingas streames doth safely bound. VVhich is restrain'd to dippe or laue His siluer breast in Neptunes waue: For he his streames hath intermixt VVith one great Flood that runs betwixt: The Riuer Iberius.And Iberus it hath to name, From whom that word Iberia came. At first sight no exploits were vsd, But was from bloudy Mart excusd: For both the Captaines spent this day To view their strength, and bands suruay. This strife remorce of minde did rue, Remorse in both the Armies. And shame the rage of Armes withdrew: Their Countries sake, and wronged lawes, Gaue one dayes leasure for a pause. No sooner day began to lurke, But Cæsar sets great Troopes a worke, Cæsars speedy expedition. As long as all the night did last, About his Campe a trench to cast. And then before this worke, the whiles His armed bandes he rankes and files, And with this slight his foe beguiles. No sooner day his first light lends, But Cæsar straight some legions sends To take a hill, that mid-way rose Betweene Ilerda and his foes. Afranius then ('twixt feare and shame) Was forc'd to entertaine this game, And first with speed possest the same. The one by sword and valor straue, At his command the hill to haue: An incounter betweene Cæsars and Afranius Souldiers. The others for their right contest, Already of the place possest. But Cæsars men laden with Armes, The Rockes doe clamber vp in swarmes. And though the place were crag'd &amp; steepe, Where footing failes, they crawle &amp; creepe: And when they hold or handfast lackes, Others with shields support their backes. The admirable courage &amp; vndertaking humor of Cæsars men. No fitting roome that place affoords To throw their darts, or fight with swords. Their Piles into the banke they stake, And by them mounting steppes do make. And whilst by shrubs and cragges they stay, Through bushes they hacke out a way. But Cæsar (seeing that his Troopes For want of helpe in danger droopes) Forthwith his aids of horsemen sends, Commanding them to backe their frends. And that they should with circling ring, Charge home vpon the left hand wing. So by this meanes vp to the top Cæsar winnes the hill from Afranius.His foot-men gat, and found no stop: For they that first the hill did gaine, Did now retire from thence amaine, Their honour lost, and labour vaine. Onely this while the chance of warre, On either side did make a marre. But now the hazards that ensue, From the vncertaine motions grew, Which then the aires vntemperance drew. The winter seasons chilly frost, With Northerne windes are turn'd and tost. And now the aire within it shrouds, Abundant heapes of clustred clouds. The hilles lay cou'red thicke with snow, And all the fields that lye more low, Wanting the comfort of the sunne, A description of winter.With hoary mists are ouer-runne. The vtmost coasts that Westward lye Were hardned with the freezing skye. But when the bright-beam'd Tytan came To lodge him with the gold fleec'd Ramme, That in the seas did Helles beare, VVhen from his backe she fell for feare, And with his flaming rayes did bring More warmth vnto the moisty spring. And with an equall poyse vpright, Did ballance out the day and night. Then Cinthia's hornes but late renew'd, Did Boreas from the aire exclude, VVhich was with Easterne shine endu'd. This East wind with Nabathean blasts, A loofe from his owne quarter casts The clouds that with him did reside, And those that in Arabia bide. And all those vaporing mists that mounts Into the aire from Ganges founts: Or whatsoeuer else the Sunne By his attractiue power had wonne, Or any fogges that North-west winde Hath to the Easterne clime design'd, Or that the Indian aire did binde. These clouds remou'd from out that sky, The dayes began with heat to fry: Nor South nor North doe tempests feele, Their rackes with cleered face doe wheele. But now the Westerne world of Spaine, These rowles of clouds doth entertaine. So this part of the globy round, That with his cliffes doth Thetis bound, These clustred wool-packes so confound, As that the aire all thicke is seene, That lies the heauen and earth betweene; And hardly roome there did remaine, These bundled vapours to containe, But prest, do powre down showres amaine. The thunder now the flash holds backe Of lightning, that precedes the cracke, They are no sooner set on flame, Foule &amp; tempestious weather in Spaine. But the moist clowds do quench the same. Here Iris now begins to show Some part of her halfe-circled bow; But not in wonted colours dy'd, The beauty thereof thicke clouds hide. Her thirst she in the Ocean slakes, And to the clouds beares what shee takes: And when they are disperst againe, They showring fall into the maine. And now the Pyrenean hilles, Whose heapes of snow neuer distilles The mounts Pyrenes. By any vigor of the Sunne, In torrents downe do swiftly runne; Dissolu'd with mighty raines that fall, Which those steepe rockes do bathe withall. So as the monstrous streames that slides Downe from those hugie Mountaines sides; A great inundation.So fast into the riuers flye, And doe their channels raise so hye, As that their bankes they ouer-stride For want of roome, their course to guide. And ouer all the field so skimmes, That Cæsars Campe now floting swimmes: And with the rage of this fierce flood, The tents are swept from whence they stood. The medowes and the pastures dry, All in a poole do bathing lye: Famine in Cæsars campe.So as no cattell they can get, Nor ought else whereof to make meate, Nor fodder for their horse to eate. For those that goe to fetch in pray, In vnknowne paths doe range and stray, And doubtfull roame on euery hand, The floods so couers all the land. Now mischiefes mate, dire famines rage, So playes his part vpon this stage, That Cæsars troopes to ruine goes, And yet besieged with no foes. One Souldier giues a heape of gaine Onely to buy a little of graine, Yet therein shewes no prodigue vaine. O hatefull humor Couetise, Whose quenchlesse thirst nought can suffise. A starued man cannot with-hold, The force of Auarice.But he will sell his food for gold. The mountaines now and hilles are hid, The floods hath all things ouer-strid: One onely face of waters vaste, Hath all the lands cleane ouer-cast. No troopes of craggy cliffes are kend, To sauadge cotes where wilde beasts dend, A great deluge.Vpon this ore-growne waters driues, Where beasts swim strugling for their liues. There flote the neighing Coursers braue, Snatcht vp with this all-sweeping waue: Which more then did the Ocean raue. The Sunne to darknesse so gaue way That night was all as cleare as day. Heauens face with such confusion mourn'd, That all was topsie-turuy turn'd: And as the Poles, and Northerne Zones, So vnder cold this milde clime grones. No twinkling starres by night are seene, The frozen earth brings forth no greene; The chill num'd aire did coole the heate, That makes the Torrid Zone to sweate. Great guider of this endlesse All, Let these dire mischiefes so befall: And Neptune, thou that hast next place, Assist vs with thy powerfull mace. O Ioue! doe not these clouds restraine, An imprecation against civill warre. But let them fill the aire with raine. And Neptune, when thou forth dost send Thy streames, forbid them backe to bend Their course, nor let them haue Retrait to thee; but with thy waue Repulse the refuge that they craue; And with thy Trident strike the ground, That fountaines may from thence abound. Let Rhenus ouer-whelme these fields, And Rhodanus that swift streame yeelds. Yea let all spring-heads flye at large, And on this soile their sourse discharge. Let mount Rhypheus snowes discend, And euery lake to this place bend. Let ponds and Pooles that stand at stay, With oblique course encline this way; Whereby the world may finde release From ciuill warres, that vs oppresse. But Fortune, with this little tutch, Is pleasd to thinke all done, to much, Vntill she Cæsar doe restore Vnto her fauours, as before. And all the Gods are now in paine To make this man amends againe. The aire therefore is rarefy'd, And Phœbus with his wonted pride Dissolues these wool-packes in the skies; Aurora blushing red doth rise. Each thing his wonted order takes, The starres from them moist humors shakes; And where dampe mists too much abound, They are confin'd within the ground. The groues begin with leaues to bud, The hilles are seene aboue the flud. The vallies and the pleasant meades Firme grasse and flowers ouer-spreades. When Sicoris had left her prankes, And drawne her selfe within her bankes; Cæsar small skiffes prepares and rigges, Composed of greene willow twigges. And ouer it doth Oxe-hides dight, Wherwith to keepe them staunch and tight. Thus able made their load to take, By them he doth his passage make. So the Venetian frames like boates, Wherewith on Padus streame he floates. And so the Brittons in such skiffes, Do coast alongst their Oceans cliffes. And so with Canes conioyn'd together, Couerd vpon with vntan'd leather. The Memphites doe on Nylus trade, Of which Canes leaues they paper made. Now Cæsar with all speed transports A many of his chiefe cohorts. Who being on the other side Do timber for a bridge prouide, Wherewith this riuer to bestride. But doubting that it might againe Aboue the bankes his channell straine, He would not on the riuers brinke The ground-work posts driue down &amp; sinke. But somwhat farther in the lands, On both sides the foundation stands; And least that Sicoris should rise With new floods, he did then deuise Deepe trenches cut alongst the sides, To draine away all swelling tides. Now when Petreius plainly found That Fate with Cæsar went so round, His courage was therewith pluck't downe, And left Ilerda's lofty Towne. And thus his Army he withdrew Petreius leaues Ilerda. From those he trusted lesse then knew: And takes his way, with all his traine, Towards the vtmost coasts of Spaine. A Nation that he heard was man'd With many a stout and warlike band: Of courage fierce, in broyles still bred, Affecting Armes, and scorning dread. When Cæsar saw the hilles left bare, And Tents no longer standing thare, He bids his troopes their Armes to take, And would not stay this bridge to make, Nor gage the riuer for a foord, But bids them swim; and with that word Cæsar passeth his Army ouer Sicoris. They cut the streame with nimble hands, And in that sort transport the bands. The Souldiers being grieu'd at heart To see their foes should so depart, In head-long swarmes do flye to Mart. No sooner dry'd, they fall to Arme, And then their chilly ioynts doe warme With speedy march, and neuer stay Vntill the noone-tide of the day. By this did Cæsars horse out-goe The marching battaile of the foe: Who were with that vnlook't-for sight Doubtfull whether to flye or fight. Here where they met, a large field lies, The place where Cæsars Armie pursues Petreius. In which two ample hilles did rise That rocky were, and nothing greene, And there a valley lay betweene. Which barren earth of stony ground A ledge of hilles doth both sides bound: And by them trending there did stray A crooked and vncoth by-way. The entrance whereof if the foe Had gained first, he safe might goe (As Cæsar saw) and lead the warre Into a Quarter strange and farre: The Countrey wilde, and ill to passe, Whose people fierce and sauadge was; Therefore he bids his men be bold, Haste on (quoth he) no order hold. Turne backe againe your flying foes, Cæsar encourageth his Souldiers.The face of Mart gainst them oppose. With threatning looks shew them their death Let cowards draw no lingring breath. If they by fight away would scape, With your sharp blades their bosomes rape. No more he said, but did preuent His foes, ere they the hilles had hent. Then there a sunder they did pitch Their Tents, fenc't with a little ditch: From whence each other did descry VVith ease, how they incamped lye. Then they began to know each other, Father the sonne, brother the brother. Their ciuill mallice waxed cold, Yet for a while from speech they hold; Onely with swords they beckning make, The two Armies take acquaintance one of the other.And so their first acquaintance take. At last vnto such tearmes they fall, That loue suppresseth raging brawle. For then the Souldiers vndertooke Into each others campe to looke: And with free hearts and dreadlesse face, VVith friendly armes their guests embrace. This man his host calles by his name, Others to kinsfolkes doe the same. Another he espies his mate, That was his schoole-fellow but late. No Roman was on either side, But he some old acquaintance spy'd. Their Armes were all with teares besprent, Their kisses do in sobbes lament. And though no bloud were drawne at all, Yet did they feare what might befall. Alas! why vexe you so your breast? What need you waile this mad vnrest? These needlesse teares were banisht quite, If you consider but a right That you your selues nurse this despight. Do you so much the mischiefe feare And exhortation to peace. That your owne humors bred and reare? Why let the Trumpet sound his fill, Regard it not, but keepe you still: And though the Ensignes flye at large, From ciuill brawles your Armes discharge. So shall you end Erinnys date, And Cæsar then in priuate state Shall cease his son-in-law to hate. O Concord with eternall grace! That sweetly do'st all things embrace: Within this mixed massie spheare, Worlds sacred loue be present heere; For now in danger stands our age, An Apostrophe to concord. To be distrest with future rage: Warres mischiefes secretly deuisd, Is now discouer'd and despisd. The mis-led people see with shame, What is the cause of all their blame, Each friend doth know his friend by name. But (ah) dire Fates, that do aduance With a sinister ordinance, The bloudy strife that shall encrease For this small time of pleasing peace. Truce now in both the Campes did swarme, With visitations free from harme. Vpon the greene turfe is their seat, Where they together friendly eate. The kinde entertainment betweene the Souldiers of both Campes. And Bacchus liquor doth abound, Huge fires they kindle on the ground. Together they do Cabbins make, But all the night no sleepe doe take, The tales they tell keepe them awake. One telles how he the trench defends, Another how his pile he bends, With strength that from his arme he sends. And whilst that some thus brags and boasts What they haue done in sundry coasts: Others againe will giue a glance, And say that this fell out by chance. Yet they poore foules doe finde content That with such faith the time is spent. But (ah) this new contracted loue Must greater future mallice proue. For when Petreius heard report, How both the Campes in friendly sort With mutuall loue each other greets, And in such kindnesse daily meets; Petreius violates the friendly complements between the two Campes.He then imployes some trusty bands, Who with their armed wicked hands, Do fall on the vnarmed foe, And ore the trenches them do throw. Then their embracements and kinde words They separate with bloody swords; So in a sauadge brainsick mood, He washt away this peace with blood. Then he enrag'd with words of ire, New fewell addes vnto old fire. O Souldiers, that with base neglect, Do thus your Countries cause reiect, And with a loose forgetfull minde, To your owne Ensignes are vnkinde; By this meanes you can neuer showe Petreius oration to his Souldiers.The faith that you the Senate owe. Can this league that you haue renewd, Witnesse that Cæsar is subdu'd By you? and can it be maintain'd, Your countries freedome thus is gain'd? Beleeue me, now you rather goe The way your selues to ouer-throw. Will you become proud Cæsars slaue Whilst in your hands you weapons haue? And whil'st the Victors happy state Depends vpon a doubtfull fate? And whilst your sturdy limbes and vaines (Not soak't with wounds) fresh blood retains? Will you as men that ill deserue, Vnder condemned Ensignes serue? Must Cæsar without more adoe Now needs be su'd and sought vnto? That he would you vouchsafe the grace, To serue in some inferior place? And must we (that command in chiefe) Of Cæsar seeke our liues reliefe? Oh no, that scorne we much disdaine, Treason shall not our safety gaine, No wicked price can vs retaine. This ciuill warre we doe not wage To saue our liues from furies rage; Our liberties, and Countries cause, Vs willingly to dangers drawes. What need we deepe mines vndertake For Steele and Iron, Armes to make? Or why should we our Citties wall, And raise huge Ramparts therewithall? What need such troopes of Coursers braue, As in our Campes we daily haue? Or to what vse should we maintaine Such towring Gallions on the maine, If we be willing to release Our liberties, to gaine a peace? A wicked oath our foes doth binde To sue these warres with constant minde. And can you with your faiths dispence, That is engag'd with iust pretence? Need you from guilt to be acquite, Because you for your Countrey fight? O shamefull and vnmanly act! That would such heynous leagues contract. Pompey, that art estrang'd by Fate, An Apostrophe to Pompey. From knowledge of the Cities state, And Armies dost prepare for warre, With aids from Kings remote so farre. Perhaps thou buildst vpon our trust, Ready to aid thy quarrell iust. Thus said, againe he sets on fire, Their mindes with wicked warres desire. An apt comparison.Like as the cruell sauadge beast, That long from forrest prey hath ceast, Shut vp within a closed cage, More mildly bred, dis-vsd from rage: At length his nature being tam'd, To humane bent is brought and fram'd. If he againe but taste the smacke Of blood, that he so long did lacke; And therewith warme his rauening Iawes, Will then with furious ramping pawes, Thirsty of bloud, expose his power His fearefull keeper to deuoure. So to all villany they goe, And monstrous treachery they show. The which vile fact they cloake with night, Blinde Fortunes deed, and Fates despight. For now behold, 'twixt bed and boord, They brutishly doe bathe the sword VVithin their breasts, whom they before VVith deere embracements did deplore. And though at first they moaning yearne, So to employ their weapons sterne: The thirsty sword that peace withstands, Offers it selfe into their hands. Yet whilst they kill, they loath the fact, Their faint blowes shew their minds distract. But now the Campe is raging hot, Petreius men vnwillingly betray their aduersaries.All faith is brutishly forgot: Their rauening hands with blood they glut, The sonnes their fathers throats do cut. Yet that the Souldiers may be freed As guiltlesse of this heynous deed: Before their two great Captaines eyes They did shew forth this bloody prize, VVhich sight did them with ioy surprize. But Cæsar, though thy gallant bands Be thus despoil'd with treacherous hands, Yet thou the Gods dost still regard, And didst not such reuenge award Vpon thy foes; when thou didst stand Triumphant in Pharsalia land. Nor when thou didst on seas of late, The stout Massilian force abate. Nor when thou didst in Ægypts soyle At Pharos, giue thy foes the foyle. But their outrage, and thy milde course Betters thy cause, and makes theirs worse. Cæsars clemency graceth his cause. For now these Captaines spirits droopes, They dare not with polluted troopes Longer incampe in Champian lands, Their Tents too neere to Cæsars stands. But to Ilerda they will flee, Petreius minded to flye to Ilerda. VVhose walles they thinke much safer be. But Cæsars horse-men them preuent, And in dry hilles they are vp-pent. VVhere want of water they sustaine, For Cæsar did their ditches draine; And them with Troopes incompast so, That from their Campe they dare not goe To fetch in water, where springs flow. When these men saw their deaths at hand No longer now in feare they stand, But carried on with raging will, Their horses first of all they kill; VVhich now can serue them to no vse, Being thus pent vp in a muse. And therefore set aside all hope, Seeing to scape was left no scope. Towards their armed foes they flye: But when that Cæsar did espye In them this furious desperate vaine; Souldiers (quoth he) your Armes refraine, Cæsars aduice to his Souldiers. Though rushing thus, they you confront, Do not receiue their head-strong brunt: I know a better way by farre, In blood I list not bathe my warre. Hee conquest gaines at too high price, That striues with those that death entice. These laddes now weary of their liues, Together with their ruine striues, To bring some wracke on vs withall; But on our swords they shall not fall: Though they desire in this staru'd mood To loose their liues, to spill our blood. O this is but a madding fit! Let them a while champe on the bit. Barre them that death so faine they would, Their courage will be quickly coold. Hold them but lingring off from fight, Vntill the Sunne with-draw his light, And in the Ocean dip his head, And that the skies be ouer-spred With starres; let Tytan siluer-bright, Giue them but space to pawse a night. Thus when they saw their Mart was mar'd, And meanes of fight they were debar'd; Their furious humor waxed cold, And in their mindes more temper hold. Like him whose breast the sword doth pierce With wounds, griefe doth become more fierce: Whilst gushing from the nerues and vaines Hot bloud, his striuing spirits straines To shew the force that yet remaines: And yet vntill the bones beginne Neerer to draw the blood-puft skinne, The whilst the witting victor stands Retyr'd, and doth with-hold his hands, Vntill a chill numme heauinesse The ioynts and spirits doe possesse Of this poore wounded man, at length Who findes himselfe depriu'd of strength, When as the gore no longer flowes, But on the wound stiffe-dried growes. Now want of water them constraines Petreius Camp distressed for want of waterTo digge and search out hidden vaines Of springs &amp; streames, that haue their birth Deepe in the bowels of the earth. And whilst about this worke they stand, They do not onely take in hand The Pick-axe, and the deluing spades, But do employ their martiall blades. And toppes of hilles they deeper sinke Then any low-lodg'd riuers brinke. The pale-hu'd Myners (that doe toyle For gold, in rich Assyrian soyle) Doe not sinke deeper pits downe-right, In dungeons more remote from light. And yet for all they can deuise, They cannot see a spring to rise. Nor any streame could be descry'd That vnder-neath the ground did slide. Nor from the sides of rocky hilles, A droppe of liquor out distilles, Though dig'd &amp; pierc'd with pick-axe bils. No drop of deaw or moisture laues The hollow dampish airy caues. Nor in the pits of grauill sand, Doth any plash of water stand. Their men thus ouer-laid with sweat, And fainting now twixt thirst and heat; Seeing that they but loose their paine, Raise them from out the mines againe. But by this diuing vnder ground, Whereas some dampish mists they found, When they come vp, can scarce endure The aire, that is more hot and pure. Neither are they refresh't with meate, They faint for drinke, and loath to eate. Hunger to them best helpe doth giue Their thirsty humor to relieue. But if that any moisty field, Do grassie roots, or greene turfes yeeld, Betweene their hands the same they squees Into their mouth, and no drop leese. Or if they meet with standing puddles, Where slime &amp; black mud stinking huddles; The Souldiers there (to get a draught) Will striue, as though a world they sought. And staruing, will contented drinke That, which they would else odious thinke. And then will take it for their feasts, To sucke the vdders of bruit beasts; And when therein no milke remaines, They sucke the bloud from out the vaines. Others fresh leaues and hearbes will pound With dew that on green boughes is found; But chiefly, those crude stalkes that twines About the tender-budding vines, They presse, and sap from yong tree rinds. O happy soules, full blest were yee, That whilst your barb'rous foes did flee, They did in all the wayes they past Poyson amongst the waters cast, And so destroyd you all at last. Our Roman youths will neuer shrinke Witting those water streames to drinke; Though Cæsar should the springs defile With vennome, or with carrion vile; Or wholesome welles should in despight, Infect with deadly Aconite: But now their bowels drowth hath fry'd, Their mouthes resemble parchment dry'd. Their tongues the baked froth doth furre, In their shrunke veines no bloud will sturre: Their lights and lungs do scarcely pant, They all refreshing humor want. And it doth grieue them to the death, Through their chopt pipes to draw their breath. Their iawes wide gaping they do stretch, The cooling deawes by night to ketch. They watch when some sweet showres will fall, Which but of late ore-whelmed all: And euermore they cast their eyes Vpon the niggard cloudy skies; And so much more it did them grieue, Because that now they did not liue Amongst Meroens parched plants, Nor with the naked Garamants, Nor vnder Cancers fiery lampe, But their staru'd Army did encampe; Where they (like Tantalus) might view, Sweet Sicoris, with siluer hue, And Iberus so swift and cleere, Both hard at hand, they nere the neere. These tamed Captaines now are calme, In stead of Bayes they carry Palme; Afranius with a carriage meeke, Peace for his guilty Armes doth seeke: And so with all his crest-falne troopes (That now in starued languor droopes) Vnto the hostile Tents he wends, Petreius &amp; Affranius submit themselues to Cæsar. And there at Cæsars feet he bends. But though he sue, yet holds his grace Not with mis-fortunes daunted face; But carries all in fitting sort For his now fate, and his late port: And with a brow secure and bold, To gaine his peace, this tale he told. Had Fate ordain'd that I should stand Thus vanquisht by a strangers hand: Afranius Oration to Cæsar. My dreadlesse Arme I soone would frame To reaue my life, and shun that shame. But now this reason doth me leade For safety of my life to pleade; Because thou Cæsar dost beleeue He nobly doth, that life doth giue. Of faction we no parties are, Our charge we held before this warre: And to that former Martiall trust, Whilst we had power, we haue beene iust, To striue with Fate we do not lust. Spaine we deliuer to thy hands, We opned haue the Easterne lands: Those coasts shall be secur'd from wracke, That thou dost leaue behinde thy backe: This conquest now on vs so gain'd, Is not with losse of bloud obtain'd, Thy hand or sword it hath not stain'd. This onely boone in thee doth rest, To spare thy foes that are distrest. It is not much that we do craue On our mishaps remorse to haue. Permit our liues that thou dost giue, From ciuill discord free to liue, And rest secure of our intent; These prostrate troops their spleen haue spent. It fits not with thy happy Armes, To mingle our subiected swarmes: Nor that our captiue Troopes should dare Triumphes with thy braue Hoast to share, These with contentment know their fare. Onely this grace let vs obtaine, The summe of Afranius Petition.That thou do not our Armes constraine, And force vs (conquer'd men) to be Hereafter Conquerors with thee. Thus said, Cæsar (of nature milde) With gracious lookes was reconcil'd: Cæsars clemency.All punishment he did remit, And them from vse of Armes acquit. No sooner was this grace obtain'd, And their faith bound to be maintain'd, But straight in heapes the Souldiers flee Many of the Souldiers kill themselues with greedy drinking.Vnto the riuers, then set free: And on the bankes did groueling fall, Striuing for that was free for all; So greedily the streames they swill, And suddenly their panches fill, As that their breath they neuer take, Striuing their thirsty iawes to slake: Whereby the aire that should relieue Their empty vaines, and comfort giue, No passage to their lights can finde; And so withall they life resign'd. This scorching pestilent disease, So still doth on their bowels ceaze, That though they ready be to burst, The more they drinke the more they thurst. Yet many comfort finde at length, And well refresht, receiue new strength. O Luxury! thou prodigue vaine, That neuer canst the meane retaine; A reprehension of Luxury. And thou insatiate Gluttonie, Pamper'd with superfluitie, That rak'st and rob'st both land and seas, Thy wanton appetite to please. O learne, and better do aduise, How small reliefe will life suffise, For Nature doth excesse despise. The strong old wine that we do keepe Time out of minde in Cellars deepe, No health or helpe at all can bring To sickly sowles, whom feuers wring. They mixed liquors do not suppe Delitiously in golden cuppe: Fresh water, and the hearty graine, Doth strength restore, and life sustaine. O! with what stormes do they contend, That in the warres their liues do spend? The Souldier now his Armes bequeaues, To Cæsar, whence he grace receaues. And more securely he doth rest, Then with his corslet on his breast. For freed thus from carke and care, Vnto the Citties they repare. And now do they that finde release From warres, by this so happy peace, That bloody trade and trauaile scorne, Wishing they neuer Armes had borne, To haue endur'd such thirst withall, A detestation of warre. And on the Gods in vaine to call, For conquest on their side to fall. The wished hope of good successe With doubts doth stoutest hearts oppresse. When Armies sterne confonting striues, Such toyles the wretched world contriues, That Fortune neuer should haue rest, If she should tend to their request, As oft as men doe call and cry, When they doe doubt of victory. For through the world must bloud be shed, Where troopes with Cæsars fate are led. And therefore we may thinke him blest, That knoweth where in quyet rest His head to shelter free from scarres, Since all the world is set on iarres; So that this wretched ciuill broyle, Men wearied do not ouer-toyle. And slumbring soules are not affright The security and contentment that poore men liue in.When Trumpets sound calles men to fight. The wife may haue her deere consort, Parents may with their children sport. And lodg'd in simple Cotes secure, Their fields may labour and manure, Vnforc'd warres hazards to endure. Thus Fortune now becomes more kinde, And hath releast from cares our minde, So as no cause of feare we finde. Cæsar is founder of our rest, But we were led by Pompey's hest. And now this boone thereby we haue, That whilst these ciuill warres do raue, For neither side successe we craue. Fortune doth not her grace expresse On Cæsars side with like successe In other coast, but there she shewes That she dares crosse him with some blows. For where the Adriaticke maine His waues doth on Salona straine. And whereas luke-warme Iaders sourse Into soft Zephyr bends his course. Antonius with his troopes resides; Which coasts vpon the vtmost sides, The Adriaticke sea doth bound: There is he shut vp in that ground, And trusts vnto those valiant bands That he had from the Curets lands. And able was his warre to wage Against the force of hostile rage; Had Famine not his campe distrest, Wherewith strong forts are oft opprest. This soyle for horse no fodder yeelds, Nor any graine grew in the fields. The hungry souldiers from the turfe Pluckes vp for food the heathy scurfe. And with their teeth do gnabbe the greene Of medowes, that earst mow'd had beene. But when these men their friends descry'd Vpon the shore on th' other side; And saw Basilus Ensigne spred, Vnder whose conduct they were led: A new deuice they vndertake, By sea their secret flight to make; But not with ships of common wont, With sayles or oares the waues to front: Distresse puts men to their shifts. But with vn-vsed stratagems, Together they did binde huge beames, That would a mighty fraight sustaine, And safely swim vpon the maine: With empty Caske supported vp, Which would not sinke, nor water sup. These bundled trees great chaines did strength, With doubled rankes combin'd in length. Not drawne with oares on either sides, Vpon the waues these vaste piles slides. But by the floating of the beames, They are borne vp vpon the streames. And in that sort doth slily wend With secret course not to be kend. For neither sailes do make them flye, Nor any oares they doe apply: But now they doe the tides attend, For then the seas did backward bend. And with the ebbe the shores and sands All bare and dry vncouered stands. But after when the swelling maine With turning flood did rise againe, These structures that they did compose, Were slidde into the floting Oase; With two shippes that before them goe, And after them these Raffes did tow. These ships had turrets built vpright, That plainly did appeare in sight; And on the decke the trembling mast Did bow, and stoope with euery blast. But now Octauius Admirall, That on the seas did gouerne all For Pompey's part, would not in hast Assaile these Raffes, but still stood fast. And did his nimble ships restraine From ranging out into the maine, Vntill the foe were in his way, Aloofe at sea, farre from the bay, Securely running on his race, Doubting no sayles to giue them chase. So doth the fearefull Hart refraine To scoure or range vpon the plaine, But sculkes and hides amongst the brakes, When by the winde the sent he takes Of bow or shaft, or human breath, Which he doth shun vnto the death. Thus while the hunt with-holds the sounds Of his fleet-hunting wel-mouth'd hounds; And therewithall in cooples clogges His Spartane, and his Cretan dogges; And suffers none the Chase to sue, But some old hound that can hunt true. On dry-foots sent, with nusling snowt, That will not put the beast in rowt, With spending of his open iawes; But when the tapise neere he drawes, Will shake his taile, and quiet stand, To fit all for the hunters hand. Now these huge Raffes with speed they load, And then conuey them from the road, VVhen as the last of dayes twy-light VVithstood the first approch of night. Then Cilix, that same Pirate old, That did on Pompeys party hold, A slight deuisd them to betray, VVhen on the seas they were mid-way. A long huge chaine there he did sinke, And to a rocke the end did linke Of the Ilyrian cliffie shore, But lets the first ship passe it ore, And so the second in likewise, And then the third he did surprise, VVith his hook't chaine, the which he drew Vnto the shore, with her arm'd crew. This land doth sheluing hollow lye Ouer the seas, strange to the eye. VVhereon a tuffe of huge trees growes, That on the waues great shadowes strowes. Hither from ships by North-windes torne Many dead carkasses are borne, And in the creekes a while lye closd, But after are againe exposd: For when the Cauernes of this bay VVith ebbe returnes his circling sway, These whirle-pooles spue vp from their maw More then Charybdis gulfie iaw; Here now this Raffe inclosed is, Deepe laden with the Colonies Of Opiterge; and then the fleet Of enemies about them meet. And all about the neighbour strands In Clusters gazing on them stands. Vulteius now discerned plaine, That he was taken in a traine: For of this Raffe he was the chiefe, And seeing no meanes of reliefe, Nor that this cumbrous tangling chaine By any force would breake in twaine, He takes his Armes with doubtfull hope, VVhether by flight to compasse scope, Or with the sword a passage ope. Yet in this hard distressed plight, Valour affoords her manly might; For being closed in a pownd With thousands that this raffe did rownd, Which scarcely had aboord it than, One Cohort full the same to man. (Although not long) they maintain'd fight Vntill at last they wanting light, The fray was parted by darke night. Then did Vulteius stoutly braue With dreadlesse speech himselfe behaue, And cheereth vp his staggering band, Amazed with the fate at hand. Vulteius manly oration to his distressed troopes.Braue youths (quoth he) weigh in your breasts This little time of night that rests; And do resolue in this short date, How you will seeke your latest fate. Scarce haue we so long time of breath, With leasure to fore-thinke our death. More glory we shall giue our end, To meet our Fate, then it attend. Those mindes do merit no lesse praise, That dare cut off their doubtfull dayes, Then those, that shorten doe the scope. Of longer yeares, that they doe hope. A Pagan resolution.For he that doth with his owne fist, In sunder breake his life-spun twist; A conquest to himselfe hath gain'd, Willing to dye comes not constrain'd. To scape, no meanes vs hope affoords, We are empal'd with Romans swords. Out-face proud death, lay dread aside, Freely affect that must betide. But let vs not (take heed withall) Like slaughtred beasts in clusters fall, With hostile hands hew'd downe and hack't, Be in a cloud obscurely wrack't: Confused fighting in Troopes, obscures particular valour.Or else be slaine whilst night doth last With showres of darts from our foes cast. For they that so confusedly Fighting, doe intermingled dye, True valour shades from sight of eye. The Gods on vs this stage bestowes In open view of friends and foes. The rowling seas, and mountaines hye, Shall see our courage death defie: This Island witnesse shall the same, And to her rockes record our fame. The coasts on both sides shall behold Valour vn-vanquisht vn-controld. O Fortune! we vnwitting are What endlesse fame thou doest prepare What felicity the Romans tooke to acquire vnto themselues future fame. Wherewith to glorifie our Fates. For all records of future dates, That endlesse ages can retaine, Our memory shall still maintaine; And for our sakes repeat with ruth, To constant Mart our spotlesse truth, Eternizing our famous youth. And Cæsar, for thy sake we know The affection that Cæsars Souldiers did beare vnto him. In this too little we bestow, With our owne swords our selues to gore, But thus beset, we can no more. This constant death that we will proue, We dedicate vnto thy loue. But enuious Fate our praise did grutch, And from it hath detracted much; In that our Parents and our sonnes With vs none of this fortune runnes. Then should they know (had we some aid) What dauntlesse spirits they way-layd. And, doubtlesse, we should make them feare To mell with vs, that such minds beare. But they may hold them well-a-paid, That no more of our ships they staid. For then must they some means haue found For our enlargement to compound; And sought with some vaine offers base, Our liuing honour to deface. O would (that now to giue our death One glory more, ere our last breath) A glorious wish.They would but vs some offer make, Whereby we might our pardon take: That we with scorne might it forsake: That thereby they might plainely know How dreadlesse we to death do goe. And not as men in hopelesse mood, With our own swords coole our own blood. Let vs such vertue now expresse, That Cæsar may with right confesse, That he in vs hath vndergone A bloody losse worthy of mone. Although we few are but a mite Mongst thousands that for him do fight, The resolution of Vulteius.Though fate would set vs free againe, That offer yet would I disdaine; Deere mates, this life to me is scorne, Deaths motiues do my thoughts suborne. Fury diuine hath rap't rap't my minde, The Gods in fauour haue design'd That we to death should giue our minde. To be willing to die is a heauenly blessingTo others they such grace deny, To thinke it happinesse to dye; Because here in this world of strife, They should protract a wretched life. Now are these noble youths on fire, To haste their fates with true desire. How much Vulteius speech did animate his little troopeWho did before gaze on the skies With heauy hearts and watry eyes, Expecting death when sunne did rise. And did behold (with grieuing feare) The stooping of the greater Beare, Before that they this speech did heare. But then they wisht to see dayes light, So free they were from deaths affright. For now their Captaines glorious words, Prouok't their hearts like points of swords. The Sphere with all her lampes of night Haste in the seas to plunge their light. The Sunne his parting then begins Castor and Pollux.From out the armes of Læda's twins, And now this lofty starre him drawes To lodge more neere to Cancers clawes And for a farewell night imparts With vs, her two Thessalian darts. The day spring doth descry abroad How Istrian troopes the Cliffes do load. And how the stout Liburnian fleet With Greekish ships in consort meet. But first, the rage of warre to cease, They offer them to treate of peace: And onely this contract would haue, To yeeld themselues, their liues to saue; Except they more desired death, Then to preserue a Captiue breath. But these braue yonkers did disdaine A parly offered, but refused. Parlie for life to entertaine. They were resolu'd that their owne Armes Should free them from all scornfull harmes. Their mindes prepar'd for vtmost woes, Could not be mou'd with clamorous foes. Few hands of theirs sustain'd the brunt Of multitudes, that them affrunt Vulteius assailed on all sides By land and seas on euery side, Constant to death they firme abide. And when they saw of hostile gore, That they had shed sufficient store; They turn'd their fury from the foe, And with themselues in hand they goe. The noble Captaine led the way Vulteius braue, that doth display His naked breast, and thus did say: That hand amongst you most of worth My blood with glory to let forth; Let him giue proofe by wounding me, That he likewise himselfe dares free From captiue fate. No more he spake, The resolution of the Romans in scorne of their foes. But therewithall short worke to make, More swords then one became so fierce, That all at once his bowels pierce. Yet he that on him first did light, Him with like kindnesse to requite, His dying hand did then bestow On him againe a fatall blow. Then all the Troope hand ouer head, With mortall wounds each other sped. In such sort rag'd the Dircæan breed, Cadmus.That did spring vp of Cadmus seed, Which did presage the dismall fate Oedepus two sonnes, Etheocles, and Polynices.Of Theban brethrens dire debate; Whose earth-bred race their linnage drawes From that same waking Dragons iawes, Whose teeth sowne in the Phasian fields, Such cankred bloody natures yeelds; As that the furrowes flowing stood With fowle inrag'd allied blood, Contriu'd by wrathfull Magickes mood. Medea.And vile Medea, that these harmes Did bring to passe with sorcerous charmes, Fear'd what thereof might more betide, Because those spelles she had not try'd. In this sort dy'd those gallant laddes, Whose mutuall fate each other glads. Death to great vertue did expose, To quell such valiant men as those. Yet they together dye and fall; No one mans hand did faile at all To giue a wound, but it did bring With dying hand, deaths deadly sting. Neither did they to strong blowes trust, But through their breasts the swords did thrust; And for it should be throughly donne, Vp to the hilts they did them runne. In this blood-thirsty slaughtring fray, A cruell slaughter.The brother doth the brother slay; Sonnes fathers send the selfe-same way. And yet their hands were not affright 'Gainst natures lawes to shew their might. But this was deem'd a pious deed, With one blow and no more to speed. Now did the bowels all bestrow The hatches, and the bloud did flow Ouer the sides into the seas. To see the light did them displease; But that with proud disdainfull grace They might looke in the victors face, And scornfully their deaths embrace. The Raffe was heap't, and ouer-spred With these braue youths that there lye dead. To whom the Conquerors impart Due funerals, as their desart. And all the Captaines wondring stood, At this braue Captaines dauntlesse mood. And now the fame of this deed donne, (As matchlesse) through the world did run. But yet this patterne cannot make Many base mindes like heart to take: Dread will not let them vnderstand, That Vertue with her valiant hand, May easily their woes release, What power rests in valour If slauish Fate do them oppresse: But Tyrants swords do them appall, Their freedome vnder force doth fall, Because they do not vnderstand Why swords were fitted to the hand. O Death! therefore doe not affright The poore dismaied coward wight; But shew thy tyrant murdrous dart Vnto the dauntlesse noble heart. Like courage he in Mart exprest That doth the Lybian fields inuest: For noble Curio leaues the rode Of Lilybey, where his abode With all his fleet, a while he made Which now the Ocean do inuade. Curio with an Army goes into Affricke. When as a friendly Northerne gale His ships vnto the port did hale, Whereas the waues the ruines beat Of great Carthagoes famous seat. And then vnto the harbour came Clupea hight, of noted name. Curios landing in Affricke.There first he maketh his discents, And farre in land did pitch his tents Hard by the slow Bagrada's sides, That furrowes vp the sands with tides. Then to the hilles his Army goes, And to those hollow rockes that showes The Gyant Antæus.Where great Antæus raigned king, As old bards do not vainly sing. Here Curio seriously desires To heare report of ancient sires, And what the peasants of the land Did by tradition vnderstand; From what occasion that tale rose, That through the world this rumor blowes. The tale of AntæusLong after that same monstrous brood Of Earth-borne Gyants, loue with-stood, Our Libian Countrey did not reare Such ore-growne creatures as they were. The Gyants that rebelled against IupiterNeither was Typhons worth so much; Nor Tityos, nor Briareus such, As in the world they glory bare; But sure the earth the heauens did spare, That then Antæus was not borne, A right Heathen conceite.Nor did in Thessaly soiorne. A man so deere vnto the earth, Antæus the son of the earth.From whom he tooke his liuing birth; As that he neuer touch't the ground, But his maine force did more abound. And when his huge limbes fainting grew, Fresh strength in them it did renue. This caue the house where he did dwell, And vnder this high rocke the cell Where he did lodge, and for his meate The flesh of Lyons he did eate. The maner of Antæus life.On wilde beasts skinnes he would not lye, Nor on the broad leaues soft and drye; But on the bare mould he would rest, Wherewith his vigor still encreast. The people ouer all the lands Were mangled with his murdrous hands. Of strangers, that the coast did trade, A slaughter and a spoyle he made. But for a time (proud of his force) He did the helpe of earth diuorce. And though he were of so great might, That none durst him withstand in fight; Yet when the fame abroad was spread, Of this foule monster so a-dread, And what great mischiefe he had donne, It mou'd Alcides noble sonne Hercules. To passe to Affricke on the maine, To buckle with this surly swaine. But ere his taske he did beginne, From him he casts his Lyons skinne, That in Cleonea he had slaine: Antæus likewise did refraine To weare his Lybicke Lyons spoyle. Then Hercules, the soueraigne oyle Vpon his brawny limbes infusd, That in Olympian games he vsd. But now Antæus (earst so stout) His proper force began to doubt; And therefore stretcht himselfe at length Vpon the sands, that gaue him strength. Now with their hands they hand-fast take, The combate between Hercules and Antæus. And fiercely doe their straind armes shake: Then did they long (but all in vaine) Each other by the collars straine, And brow they doe confront to brow, Which neither of them both would bow: But each of them did muse to see One that his equall match could bee. Alcides yet forbare to show His vtmost vigor on his foe: But vrg'd him so with cunning slight, That out of breath he puts him quight; Which by oft panting he exprest, With cold sweat trickling downe his breast. Then both their necks with straining shakes Breast against breast resistance makes, Whilst their crost arms, with stooping chine About each others thighes they twine. Then doth Alcides leaue that hold, And fiercely both his armes did fold About Antæus bending waste, And wringing girds his bowels fast; Whilst he his foot with skill did slide Betwixt his shankes, and made him stride. Then with an in-turne following that, Vpon his backe he threw him flat. The parched earth the sweat receaues, And vnto him new force bequeaues: Antæus str?gth renewed by touching the earth.Fresh blood reuiueth euery vaine, His sinowy necke grew strong againe. His ioynts more firme and nimble were, And with such force himselfe did beare, That all that Herc'les did before, His body now annoy'd no more. Herewith Alcides grew amaz'd, And on this strength increasing gaz'd, For he was not so much affright, Hydra.When he did with that Hydra fight, That new heads for his old could dight, In the Inachian plashie fenne, Though he were but a stripling then. Long doubtfully did they contend: One trusts the strength the earth did lend; Th' other did on the vertue rest That lodg'd within his manly breast. Iuno.His bitter step-dame neuer had Such cause as now her hopes to glad, In seeing him so hard bestad: For now she sees his limbes to sweate, And his strong shoulders starke with heate, Whereon he wonted was to beare The burthen of the starry spheare. But now againe he did begin His armes about his foe to cling, Which when Antæus did perceaue, He straight vnto the earth did cleaue, From whence new force he did receiue. And all the helpe the earth could giue, Her sonne therewith she did relieue; And labours with her might and maine, His wearied limbes to strength againe. Now when Alcides found at length, That still he did renew his strength By vertue of the touched earth His mother, whence he tooke his birth. Stand now (quoth he) and trust no more As thou didst to the earth before: Hercules words to Antæus. I will restraine thee from that hope, Within my armes shall be thy scope. Thy heft shall stay vpon my breast, Here is the place that thou shalt rest. And with that word aloft him hent, That struggling to the earth-wards bent. But there the ground no whit auailes Her childs crusht chest, whom death assailes. Thus did Alcides gird him fast, Vntill his chine he brake at last. And now deaths pangues, with crazie cold On all his limbes did lay sure hold. Thus he a long time did him straine, Antæus kild by Hercules. Ere he would let him fall againe. This combate hath beene since the cause, From whence our Countries ancient sawes, Admiring this great Gyants fame, Vnto his mother gaue his name. But since a name of greater grace, Was giuen vnto this hilly place By Scipio, that braue Roman knight, That did by valor and by might, Scipio Africanus. Constraine the hostile Punicke powers Home to returne from Latium bowers. And here when first the Lybicke land He did inuade,, his campe did stand: And in this place still may you see Where ramparts and huge trenches bee; So as the fields did first of all, Vnto the Roman conquest fall. Curio is pleasd that he hath found The chance of such a lucky ground, And thinkes the fortune of the place Curio's vaine conceit.His warre with like successe would grace, As it had done that noble Peere Scipio, that earst incamped heere. And therefore on this happy land, His haplesse tents he causd to stand: Too loosely he doth range his host, And of these hilles the vantage lost. Then with vnequall force doth goe To dare a mighty armed foe. In Affricke all the Roman bands Actius Varus Pompey's captaine in Affricke.That seru'd, were vnder Varus hands; Whose Latium forces might suffice, Yet he seekes all the best supplies That Lybicke kingdome would affoord, And subiects were to Iuba's sword: Who farre and neere his force did raise, And so his standard he displaies. King Iuba.In all that continent no King Could so great powers together bring. His Territory from the west, Where Atlas mount neere Gades doth rest Begins, and so forth Eastward runnes Vnto the Syrtes, where Ammon wonnes: And then in bredth takes all that cost, Whose lands the Torrid Zone doth tost; With those vaste kingdomes stretcht a farre, That bounded with the Ocean are. Vnto his Campe repaired these, The Nation of Antololes, The vagrant fierce Numidæans, The still prepar'd Getulians That doe vnarmed horses ride. Then Moores, whose skins are cole-black dy'd The Nasamons that riches wants, And all the parched Garamants. The Marmaryds so swift of foote, With Maxans, that as strongly shoote Those darts that from their armes they throw, As Medes can shafts out of a bow. And those Massilians that bestride Their horses bare-back't when they ride, A nation that ride and rule their horses without bridles. And neuer doth a bridle need, But with a wand can guide his steed. The hunting Aphers, that did vse No steady dwelling house to chuse, The seuerall nations vnder Iuba. But rang'd in Tents from place to place, As they pursue the Lyons chase; And trusts not to their headed speare, But with their clokes his eyes will bleare, And nothing do his raging feare. A strange maner of hunting the Lyon. Neither did Iuba raise his Mart, Onely regarding to take part With one side in this ciuill fight, But was drawne on with priuate spight. For Curio in his Tribunes time, That had committed many a crime Against the Gods, and humane right, Did practise then with all his might, Iubas particular malice to Curio. By his owne Tribunitian law, King Iuba's realme from him to draw: And to disgrade him from the Throne, By true discent that was his owne. VVherein thou didst thy power display, VVhen Rome gaue thee too great a sway. Iuba remembring this abuse, Did of this warre make priuate vse, Hoping thereby that vncontrold He should his crowne more freely hold. The fame of this offended king VVith feare in Curios Campe did ring: The rumor of Iubas mallice troubles Curios Campe. For most of all the troopes he led, In Cæsars Armes were neuer bred; Nor in those Gallicke warres were train'd, Nor with their blood the Rhene had stain'd. But from Corfinium garrison They were with-drawne when it was wonne. And to new leaders bare small trust, As they to former were vniust, Still thinking to doe what they lust. When therefore Curio plainly saw Base feare their mindes did ouer-awe; Whereby the trenches euery night Were barely man'd by sluggish fright: And that his Souldiers day by day From out the trenches fled away: His minde these ill presages mates, And with himselfe he thus debates. Daring attempts doe couer dread: Curio finding his Army staggering, debates with himselfe what course to take.My Ensignes therefore I will spread, And with my Souldiers take the field, Whilst they to me obedience yeeld: For Idlenesse breeds mutiny, But action voids conspiracy. Whilst that the valiant minde is prest, And sees the sword against his breast, His helmet then doth shelter shame; He leasure wants to scorne, or blame His Captaines will; or to compare How martiall causes ordered are. But on which part in armes he stands, There he imployes his hired hands. So do the fencers, for rewards Expose their skill and ventrous guards Against their riuals in their fight, Not led thereto with ancient spight. But when they meet, their force they straine, Which of them shall the conquest gaine. This when he had revolu'd in minde, He to the field his hoast design'd. And Fortune giues him one faire day, Whom afterwards she did betray. For he in battaile Varus meetes, Curio ouerthrowes Varus in the field.And with such force his Army greets; As that he made him turne his face, Put him in rout, and gaue him chase; Who neuer turn'd his face againe, Vntill his Campe did him constraine. These heauy newes abrode were blowne, That Varus now was ouer-throwne: VVhich when to Iuba's eares it came, He was well pleased with the Fame, Iuba glad of Varus ouerthrow. Presuming that this warfare stayes For him, thereof to win the praise. And therefore secretly ordain'd Great force, which he with speed retain'd For this exployt, by him conceald With charge it should not be reueald. He onely fear'd that his intent His foe would fearefully preuent. Sabbura was the second man That ruled all his kingdome than; And vnto him he did commit A little troope that he thought fit To march before, and with no moe Into the field to tyce his foe: Pretending that vnto his hands He had committed all the bands: Meane while the King with his huge Traine, Lay hidden in a hollow plaine. So doth the Serpent, enemy Vnto the Aspicke, hidden lye, A Simile. And with a subtile shadow drawes Him neere vnto his murdring iawes: And when the Aspicke nought suspects, He suddenly his head reflects, And with his teeth the throate doth squise, Not where the lurking poyson lies; And therewithall this vermin dies. VVho then his venom forth doth cast, But all in vaine, and all in wast. So fraud sits now in Fortunes lappe, For Curio haught with his late happe, Did not forecast the deepe deceit Of his strong foe, that lay in wait. But ouer-night he giues in charge That all his horse-troopes should enlarge Curio too venterous, neglecteth good aduice.Themselues, and range the fields about; And in the morning he drawes out From forth his Campe, his armed bands, Who in the field imbatteld stands. Yet he was warn'd (but all in vaine) That close his campe he should containe, And wary be of Lybicke baytes, And of the Punycke warres deceytes. The Punicke deceit in war.But Destinies resistlesse date, Gaue vp this yong man to his Fate. And now this ciuill warre betraid Him, that her first foundation laid. His troopes and Ensignes he displayes, And leades them ouer rocky wayes; Which when his enemy espyde, From hilles a farre where they recide; With fraud they seeme (as men affright) To make retrait in open sight; Vntill thereby they could procure Their foe to leaue a place so sure, And strong, as those high mountaines were; And that the Army did not feare To range it selfe in martiall wise, Where as the open Champian lies. Now Curio thought his foes did flye, Curio deceiued with an ambush.And did not their deuice descrye; But as a Conquerour, in haste His Army in the fields he plac't. And then the Lybicke guile brake out: For those that fled but for a stout, With horse-men ceiz'd the hilles about; And with huge troopes they did enclose On euery side, their Roman foes. This Curio somewhat did amaze, His hope-lost troopes stood at a gaze; Yet sought they not for feare to flye, Nor strong enough with force to try. Their tired horse, when Trumpets sound, Would neither snoring bray, nor bownd: Nor with their hoofes the earth would stamp, Nor straine their bridles whilst they champe The foamy bits, nor creasts vp-reares, Nor with a courage pricke their eares. Nor striue amongst the thronging troope, Curios horse-troopes spent and tired. But all fore-spent, their heads down droope. And crest-falne smoking in a sweat, Their mouthes are dry, and parcht with heat. Their tongues do hang below their iawes, Hoarse grones they send from out their maws With thick drawne winde they puffe &amp; pant, Their flankes doe rise, and breath doe want. And all their bits were smeared ore With dusty dryed frothy gore. So as they hardly could be got With whips or wands to keepe a trot. Nor yet with often stroke of spurre Could they at last be made to sturre. It nought auailed him that rides, To rent and teare their bloody sides. His pace he would not so aduance, With force thereof to breake a launce; Which greatly did the foe auaile, For they the while did them assaile Aloofe with darts as thicke as haile. Now when the ranging Aphers prest The battaile betwixt Curio and Sabbura. In with their troopes amongst the rest, Their trampling steeds so beat the ground, That all the hill therewith did sound. And therewith raisd such dusty smokes, That all the aire it dimmes and chokes. Like as when the Bistonian blasts, With rage whole hilles of sands vp casts; VVhich in such clouds aloft doe rise, As that they dimme and darke the skies. No sooner now their raging Mart Vpon the foot they did conuart, But that the fight was out of doubt. Curio's Army oppressed with numbers of foes Death spent the time amongst the rout. Forward at all they could not presse, Nor vse their Armes in this distresse. So were they compast round with foes, That roome they want to deale their blowes. Their speares held vpright in their hands, Were throng'd together in whole bands. So heapes of foes their helpe confounds, Neither fall they alone with wounds, This fighting in an orbe was the last refuge that the Romans vsed euer in extremity.And bloud; but this them death affoords, The clouds of darts, and weight of swoords. And then for last refuge of all, The troopes now left that were but small, Into a little orbe did fall. And those that vtmost bare the stresse, If they into the midst would presse For feare, thereby reliefe to gaine, Hardly escap't, but there was slaine. This battail'd Orbe now grew so thicke, And did so close together sticke, And foot to foot so pressing stands, They could not vse their martiall hands. Their thronged bodies spare prest, That arm'd, they crush each others breast. The conquering Moore did not delight So much to heare of their hard plight, That Fortune prostrates to his might; Not hauing seene the bodies slaine, Nor how the streames of blood did draine, Nor that the limbes bestrewd the land, For now the Orbe so thicke was mand, That bodies dead vpright did stand. Thus Fortune sends new slaughtred wights To please Carthagoes enuious sprights: The sacrifice of this braue Host, May well appease the thirsty ghost Of bloudy Hanniball, and those That Punicke warres hath made our foes. But (O yee Gods) this Roman spoyle That now is made on Libicke soyle, To Pompey cannot yeeld content, The Senate will this wracke lament. Let Affricke thereof make her gaines, Whose fields our Latium blood distaines. When Curio saw his hoast in rout, And that their blood so stream'd about, As that therewith the dust was laid, And with the gore the land beraid; His heart could not endure the sight Of his poore mens distressed plight, Nor would he saue himselfe by flight. But on his foes he prest amaine, And so amongst his Troopes was slaine. Curio and his Army destroyed. He now disdaines longer to liue, Valour to him his end did giue. What can the Rostrum thee auaile? Or Forum now, when Fates assaile? What boots it, that in thee it lay The armed peoples willes to sway? What profits it thy voyce did draw The Senate to infringe the law? Whereby the Father and the Sonne, This hatefull ciuill warre begunne. Sith thou to death thy date must yeeld, And shalt not see Pharsalia's field: He taxeth Curio for faction. Where these great Captaines, led with rage To battailes chance, their states engage. For crosse-bent Fate denies to thee The issue of these warres to see. So you disturbers of the state, Make your owne selues a prey to fate; And pay the price with your owne blood, For which you sold the common good. O happy Rome! couldst thou but finde Thy Citizens so iust and kinde, An Apostrophe to the Roman Lords. As that the Gods their mindes would moue, Rather to cherish and to loue The publique freedome of the state, Then to reuenge their priuate hate. O noble Curio 'tis thy meed, The rau'ning Libicke fowles to feed; For to thy lot will neuer fall The honor of a funerall. But yet our lines might merit blame, To silence that which for thy name Deserues to be in brasse inchast, That with all ages it might last. I yeeld this therefore to thy spirit, The due commend that it did merit. Curio's praise. Rome neuer bred a greater wit, That did within the Rostrum sit: Nor more did dignifie the lawes, Whilst thou didst stand for iustice cause. Auarice and Bribery the ruine of RomeBut after Pride and Luxurie, With auaritious Briberie, Possest the head-strong wils of youth; They swamme in streames that led to ruth. So with the times things changed then, That age corrupt, corrupted men; And Curio blasted with the rest, Was chiefest cause of Romes vn-rest. For Cæsar did his minde inthrall, With golden gifts of conquered Gaule. Though Sylla's power, and Marius wrath, And Cinna's rage bred Roman scath; Though Cæsars ancient noble line, With glory long did sway and shine: Yet for all this, their swords lack't might To frame a tyranny out-right: They all did still attempt with gold, To purchase Rome, which Curio sold. Finis Libri quarti. The fifth Booke. The Argvment. In Greece the Senate doe decree, That Pompey shall their leader be. Then Appius doth to Delphos goe, The Oracles aduice to know. Now Cæsar hauing maistered Spaine, His mutiners supprest againe. And then to Rome in haste he goth, There Consull and Dictator both. Thence to Brundusium he departs, And to Epyrus bends his Marts, He rashly venters on the Maine: Then comes Antonius with his traine. Pompey Cornelia doth betake To Lesbos, whilst he warre doth make. These Captaines now on either side, The wrackes of Ciuill warre had try'd, And Fortune partiall vnto neither, Fortune as yet stands indifferent betweene Cæsar and Pompey. Mingled good lucke and bad together; Bringing them with an equall hand, Into the Macedonian land. Mount Æmus now was thatch't with snow, That from th' Atlanticke skies did blow. And then the feast dayes onward drew, VVhich did their Magistrates renew. And that prime season gan appeare, That leads the vaunt-gard of the yeare. But whilst some latter time remaines To those that yet doe rule the raines, The Consuls both did then decree The Senate should assembled be, VVith those great Lords both farre &amp; neare, In Prouinces did office beare. Epyrus the randevous of Pompey's forces.And then Epyrus they did chuse The place for this warres Randezvous. But oh this forraigne sordid seat! For Roman Peeres was farre vnmeet. It needs must be a scornfull iest, That their high Court should be a guest In stranger lands, there to debate The Councels of the Empires state. For who a Campe will deeme this place, That all the Consuls axes grace? Pompey followes the Senate, and not the Senate Pompey.The Senates reuerend order sayes, They runne not after Pompeys wayes. But Pompey for the publicke cause, Saith he obserues the Senates lawes. Now when these sad assembled Peeres, VVith silence gaue attentiue eares: Lord Lentulus from his high Throne, In these words makes his meaning knowne; Lentulus oration to the Senators in the Campe.If courage such your mindes doe feed, As worthy of the Latium breed: Or ancient blood boyle in your breast, VVhat matter is't where Romans rest: Regard not how farre we reside From Rome, by Cæsar vilefi'd. But know you now with loue and grace Your natiue Countrey peoples face. First therefore reuerend Fathers heare, By all your powers make it appeare That you the rightfull Senate are, Whose high decrees in peace and warre, Nations must reuerence neere and farre. For be it so that Fortunes sway Would carry vs so farre away, As where the ycie lesser Beare Doth dimly twinkle in the spheare: Or else whereas the Torrid Zone Refreshing vapours casteth none. But alwayes with one counterpaise Equals the length of nights and dayes; Yet wheresoeuer we should roame, There alwayes is the Empires home. With vs we hold, as proper mate, The supreame care and rule of state. So when with fire the furious Gaules Assail'd the high Tarpeian walles; At Veia did Camillus wonne, Camillus. And there did Rome her fortune runne. The Senatorian ordred state Is neuer chang'd by place or date. Cæsar the City doth retaine, Whose houses empty do remaine. The mourning Courts he ouer-awes, Where Armes haue silenced the lawes. The Roman Courts know but the face Of Senators which he did chase From out the Citty swarming than; And him that Cæsar did not ban Of that great Senatorian traine, His fellowship we must disdaine. That fury first did scatter such As did at wicked discord grutch; Who with their children and their wiues, In peace desir'd to lead their liues. But yet for all this raging vaine, Here are we now well met againe. And all the Gods in recompence Of Italie (though chast from thence) Hath giuen vs (to cheere our hearts) The whole worlds force that takes our parts. And now in the Ilirian maine, Vulteius and his troopes are slaine. And Curio, that was greatest part A speech of scorne to Cæsar.Of Cæsars Senate in his Mart; Lies foyl'd, with all his Martiall bands, In Affrickes filthy parched sands. Therefore your Ensignes now display, Braue Captaines thrust on Fortunes way; In Ioues high grace your hopes repose, Your mindes as forward now expose, Against the forces of your foes, As you were ready then to run, When their approches you did shun. Our power no further doth extend, For with the yeare the Consuls end. But reuerend Lords your powerfull state Is not confin'd to any date. Therefore conclude amongst you all, Pompey chosen General of the Army for the Senate.That Pompey be your General. Hereat the Senate did reioyce, And then decreed with one voyce, That they would lay on Pompey's fate, The publique and their priuate state. That done, to honors they prefer'd The Kings and people that deseru'd. And vnto Rhodes, Apollo's seat, (Whose power by sea was stout and great) They presents gaue, and for their truth, The like vnto the homely youth Of Taygety; and then the Towne Of ancient Athens they renowne. And to Massilians (Cæsars spoyle) They freely gaue the Phocean soyle. Then Sadalen, and Cotyn strong, And Deiotarus that had long Beene loyall to the Roman state, To honors they did eleuate: And therewithall Rhasipolin, The Lord of that coast whereas binne The chilly sharpe windes fostered; All these with praise were honored. Then by the Senators decree, Iuba designed was to bee The soueraigne of all Libicke land, To sway that scepter with his hand. But oh dire Fates, thou that hast name Of Ptolomey, thou Fortunes shame! Ptolomey discended of the race of Peleus. To thee a kingdome was design'd, Whose people were of faithlesse kinde: The Gods herein most faulty were, To grace thy wretched head of haire VVith that braue Alexandrian crowne, That had from Peleus his renowne. Thou boy didst take the sword in hand, To rule the people of this land. Yong Ptolomey king of Ægipt, that caused Pompey to bee slaine, and had almost betraied Cæsar. And would to God to them alone Thy tyrant sword had beene made knowne; But Lagus Realme was giuen thee more, And thou defil'd with Pompey's gore, Thy sisters Crowne thou didst depriue, And Cæsars wracke wel-neere contriue. This great assembly now dismist, The multitude in Armes persist. VVhilst Souldiers and the Captaines all, Fore-casting nought what might befall, Their Ensignes and their Armes aduance, Guided by giddy Fortunes chance. But Appius was the onely man Appius seekes to know of the Oracles what shall bee this warres euent. That did this purpose better scan: For he did feare with rash attempt To hazard doubtfull warres euent; And therefore he the Gods besought To shew to what end twould be brought. VVhich done, he takes his iourney then To the Phœbeian Delphicke Denne, That he this Oracle might heare, VVhich had beene shut vp many a yeare. Parnassus mountaine toppe is spred VVith lofty double forked head. And in the worlds mid way doth rest, It was a little before Christ came that the Oracle, ceast, as was fore-prophesied by the scriptures.Iust plac't betweene the East and West. This sacred hill, as eld designes, To Phœbus, and the God of wines With equall hest was consecrate, Where they their Oracles relate. His onely toppe surmounting stood Of all the earth aboue the flood, That in Deucalions time did drowne The world with her high towring crowne, And onely as a confine seene The Pagans conceit of Parnassus mount.The waters and the skies betweene. Yet thou Parnassus didst not rise So high, but that one forkes poynt lyes Vnder the water hid from eyes. Reuenging Pæan there did show The vigor of his arme and bow. Calling to minde his mothers wrong, Whilst he within her wombe did throng: She from her natiue home expeld, He with his arrowes Python queld, Which yet he scarce had skill to weld. Themis, the Goddesse of Iustice.This sacred soyle as then did rest With Trypods vnder Thæmis hest. As soone as Pæan first beheld The sounding voyce these caues did yeeld, Diuinely breathing out such sawes, With windy words from earths deep iawes, He secretly himselfe with-drawes, And in the sacred dennes did shade, There Pæan was a Prophet made. What God (quoth he) is here inclosd? What supreme power (from heauen deposd) Vouchsafes confined thus to dwell Within this solitary Cell? What Deity of heauenly birth Can be partaker with this earth? Within whose all conceiuing breast, Eternall secrets liue and rest. Whose high fore-knowledge hath descride What shall in future times betide. This seemes to hold great correspondency with the description of the incarnation and life of our blessed Sauiour. That preacheth to the peoples eares, That humane forme and nature beares. Dreadfull and potent in his state, And whether he doth sing of Fate, Or do command that which he sings, He Fate vnto perfection brings. Perhaps of Iupiter entire, A great part doth his soule inspire; Which was vnto the earth downe sent To sway this or by continent With true proportion'd vpright paise, Whereby amidst the Aire it staies. Which power diuine, accustom'd then To haunt in this Cyrrhæan Denne, Cyrrha a Citty at the foote of Pernassus. And was withall conioyned nye To thundring Ioue aboue the skye. This power that had such grace receiu'd, Was in a virgins breast conceiu'd. With humane soule it did subsist, Sounding his voice when as him list: The mouth he opened of the Priest, With so great force as flaming blasts That Mountaine Aetna's toppe out casts. Or as Typhæus ouer-prest With hugie weight vpon his breast, (Whom great Inarymes doth hide) Constrained (from his stomach wide) To vomit vp, with ratling grones, Campana's flinty rugged stones. This power exposd to all mens good No mortals prayers hath withstood; Onely his nature doth disdaine To be defil'd with humane staine. Wicked inchanters neuer dwels Nor yet converse within his celles: There witches mutter not their spelles. A constant truth his speeches are, To alter which none ought to dare. Forbidding mortals that desire, His fauour is the iust mans hire. For vnto such (cast from their seat) He hath restored Cities great. The Tyrrians so he did relieue, And gaue them meanes away to driue The threatnings proud of hostile Lords, As Salaminian sea records. The barren lands he fruitfull makes, Contagious aires away he takes, And teacheth how the same he slakes. This age of ours with griefe may say, The Gods from vs hold not away A blessed gift of greater grace, Then was this Delphicke sacred place. Which prophesing no longer sings, The griefe that the Pagans conceiued for the ceasing of their Oracles.So future feare doth hold our kings: And in that iealous doubtfull vaine All Oracles they doe restraine. Yet Cyrræn Prophets nought lament, That so their voyces are vp-pent, Or that their Temples none frequent. For if this God-heads spirit lights Within the hearts of mortall wights, They that this power diuine receaues, Death vnto him thereby bequeaues The opinion of the Pagans concerning this Oracle.The full reward of present blisse, Or else his paine eternall is. For those weake powers of humane life Faint in the waues and vrging strife, That in this fury raigneth rife. So can the Gods, when they doe streeke. Shake mortall mindes, and make them meeke. Now Appius that searcheth out Appius comes to the Oracle.To vnderstand this latest doubt Of the Hesperian hidden Fate; Addrest himselfe vnto the gate Of this same silent vncoth caue, Whose Oracles no answeres gaue Long time before; nor Trypods draue. There he the Prelate doth intreat Then to set ope his sacred seate, And to let in the fearfull Nunne Phæmonoë, that now did runne, And gadde about in shady woods, And by Castalio's secret floods, Where wandring carelesse she was caught, And so vnto the Temple brought. The Nunne whom feare did now disswade This vgly entry to invade, Vsd all the Art she could inuent To hold this Lord from his intent, Phæmonoë disswadeth Appius from searching this Oracle. Whereon his minde was so hot bent. Great Roman Lord, I muse (quoth she) What wicked hope inueagleth thee To search to know thy future Fate, Where Oracles are out of date. Pernassus long hath silent stood, The God suppressed hath his mood: His voyce is either dumbe or hoarse, Or else this seat he doth not force. But rometh in by-waies vntry'd, Or Pythons Trypod-couering hide, Is by Barbarians burnt and fry'd: Whose ashes in the Cauernes lies, And Phœbus passage so denies. Or whether that the Gods high hest With Cyrrha's prophesies shall rest, And that the Sibylls old presage Of things to come in future age, Which are committed vnto verse, Sufficiently may Fates rehearse. Or Pæan (that is vsd to chase The spirits of a harmfull race) Cannot finde out in this fraile time, A truthfull tongue deuoid of crime. Phæmonoë fearefull to enter the Cauerne of the Oracle. Now in this virgins words and cheere, Dissembling fraud did plaine appeare. Her guilty feare did then descry She falsely did the Gods deny. Her writhed fillet she doth dresse Vpon the fore-part of her tresse. Her lockes hung downe her backe behinde: Vpon her crowne she wreathing twinde A garland greene of Laurell dight, With Phocian vaile of lawne pure white; But in the porch she made a stay: The priest then pusht her on her way. Yet she, poore soule, was sore adread Into the horrid cell to yed: Lothing the gastly dennes to proue, Nor from the Porch would she remoue. But there right doth a muttring faine, As though the spright she did retaine, And yet her breast he did not straine. In this sort she vntroubled stood, With quiet voyce, and sober mood; Which shewd no sacred furies guise Did her distracted sence surprise: Neither could that smooth tale she told, With Appius more credit hold, Then it was able to abuse The Trypods, or Apollos muse. No trembling sounds doe stoppe her words, The Cauerne vaste no voyce affoords: Her garland doth not brandling reare, With the vp-rising of her haire: The Temples steeple no whit shakes, The shady groue no blustring makes. And she poore wretch the whilst still feares, With Oracles to trust her eares. This while the Trypods yeeld no signes, And Appius vnto rage enclines: Wherewith he said, thou false for-sworne, That hast both Gods and Me in skorne; Thy fraud thou deerely shalt abye, Except thou enter presently This cauerne, and do truths relate, Presume not of thy selfe to prate In matters of this great aduice, No lesse worth then the worlds whole price. Herewith the Nunne was so agast, Phæmonoë enters the Cauernes by the constraint of Appius. That to the Trypods she makes hast. And to the Cauernes being come, She stands amaz'd, and waxeth dumbe. And with an vnaccustom'd breast, The spirit she receiues her guest: So as not any long of yore This caue so fully did explore. Then did the Cyrrhen Furie runne So fiercely through this rapted Nunne, That neuer any had like part Of this diuine Phœbæan Art. Her proper wits it driues away: Now now (quoth she) heare whilst you may And trust vpon the words I say. Her necke she whirles, and windes about, And madding through the dens doth strout. Her phillets, and Phœbæan bayes, Her vpright staring lockes did raise. And through each horrid vacant place, The description of one inspired with the fury of prophesying. She flings about with gastly face: And where the Trypods she doth meete, She ouer-whelmes them with her feete. She frets and burnes with inward fire, Phœbus on her exprest his ire, Not onely with his stripes and threats, But he her bowels flaming heats, And her inspires with so great skill, That she was stinted of her will. For 'twas not lawfull she should show Those wondrous things that she did know. All times beginnings, and their ends She sees, and fully comprehends. And euery ages destiny Within her racked breast doth lye. Huge heapes of things to her appeares, She swels with gesse of future yeares, Whose fates whilst she conceald doth hold, In her did struggle to be told. The worlds last dayes she viewed than, With that first houre that it began. The secrets of the Ocean vast, Reuealed were to her forecast: And therewithall she vnderstands The iust account of all the sands. So great a Prophetesse some time There liu'd in the Euboean Clime, That did disdaine her secret Art, Sybilla CumanaWith forraigne nations to impart. And yet amongst so great a troope That vnder fatall bonds did droope, With haughty hand she fram'd her sprite The Roman destinies to write. Phœmonoë so with fury fild, Labours the like content to yeeld To thee (O Appius) that seek'st out To be resolued of thy doubt. But much a doe she hath, God wot, To light vpon thy single lot, Amongst so many destinies, As in Castalia hidden lies. With flowing foame her mouth grows white, And raptures agonize her sprite: She groanes, and therewith gasping throbs, And yelling shrill she sighing sobs. With heauy howling then she raues, Which rings throughout the vaulted caues. Then growing tame, her worke beginnes, And thus her latest words she sings. The words of the Oracle to Appius. Thou Roman shalt the dangers great Of these warres scape, that doe thee threat. And in the vast Euboean soyle Thou shalt rest safe, and free from toyle. So said, she did conceale the rest, And Pæan then her tongue supprest. Yee Trypods that the Fates doe keepe, And of the world the secrets deepe. And thou (O Pæan) that wantst power To hide the future of one hower From knowledge of the Gods on hye, Why strangely dost thou so deny The latest ruine to relate That shall oppresse the Empires state? The Captaines slaine, the death of Kings, The fall of Nations that it brings. Whose liues the destinies thinke good, To mingle with the Latium blood? Haue not as yet the powers diuine Resolu'd, how this wracke shall encline? And are so many Fates obscur'd, As though the starres were not assur'd That Pompey's head is doom'd to dye, Or else doe these things silent lye? That Fortune may due vengeance take Vpon that sword that makes all quake, With chastisement his rage to slake. And raise the Brutes, to quell the raigne Of Tyrants that would rise againe. Then with her breast the virgin push't The Bruti, suppressers of Tyrants. Against the gate, which open rush't. Out of the Temple so she went, But yet her fury was not spent: Though not a word at all she spake, For yet the God did not forsake Her breast, but there his stay did make. She still doth whirle her gogling eyes, And wistly stares vpon the skies. One while she shewes a fearfull grace, And sometimes looke with scowling face. A steady eye she neuer keepes, Her lippes red flaming colour steepes. Her cheekes were deadly pale to sight, Not as when terror brings affright. But bloodlesse wannish, and her heart Did beat, as though her life did part. But as the seas, when stormes doe slake, Will swell, and hollow roaring make; So with her many sighes out-sent, She grew appeasd, her breast had vent. And when she seuerd had her sight, A while from out the sacred light, Which had reueal'd to her all Fate, She was restor'd to her old state. Her humane notions came againe, And Pæan did her bowels baine With water of the Lethe flood, All was forgot she vnderstood. The secrets of the Gods were fled, And she no longer prophised. All future fore-cast that inspire, To Phœbus Trypods did retire. Downe-right she fell into a trance; Appius misconstrues the words of the Oracle to his owne advantage.But Appius though thy death aduance, Thou dost not yet a right conceaue What doubtfull fate to thee doth cleaue; For thou deluded with false hope, The whole worlds rule tak'st for thy scope: And with an idle misconceit, Dost thinke to make thy safe retrait In Calcis and Euboian land, And fondly bearst thy selfe in hand (O foole!) with that which cannot be: For how canst thou from cares be free, Amidst this whole worlds storme of strife, The true meaning of the Oracle concerning Appius.Except the Gods bereaue thy life? And that is true; for thou shalt haue Prepar'd for thee a worthy graue, Neere to the strict Euboian costs, Whereas huge rockes of marble posts, Charistos hath such quarries store, And whereas Rhamnis doth adore Nemesis, the Goddesse of Reuenge.Great Nemesis, that there doth keepe Neere to the straits of that vaste deepe Euripus cal'd, whose rapid course With checking tides, and changing sourse: The Calcidonian trading masts On Aulis wracking channels casts. Cæsar meane while remoues his hoast From the Iberian conquered coast, And his victorious Ægles flye Vnto another stranger skye. And then the Gods had wel-neere quel'd That good successe which long he held. For now whilst he no warre did wage, He stands in doubt that mutines rage Within his Campe would raise some broyle, And so his plotted warfare spoyle. Whilst that his chiefest troopes now fild With blood, in many battailes spild: Their faith did from their Captaine fall, And were it that the Trumpets call Had not of late stir'd vp their sprights, Or that from their accustom'd fights Cæsars Army returning out of Spaine, Mutinies. Their swords to scabbards now confin'd, All martiall rage chast from their minde. Or whether that the swaggering sway Was to procure some larger pay. But so it was amidst these flawes, They curse their Captaine, and the cause; And do accuse their proper Armes As guilty of these ciuill harmes. Neuer was Cæsar better try'd, Then now this mutiny to guide. He sees all in a staggering way, Vncertaine how mens mindes would sway: And like a body reft of hands, As vnassisted now he stands: And almost left to his owne sword, Cæsar perplexed. Saw now what twas that did affoord Him meanes such warres to entertaine, 'Gainst all the world by land and maine; That 'twas the Souldiers ready armes, And not the Captaines fatall charmes. But now amazed murmure rose, Their rage they openly oppose: For that same cause that is of wont, Of wauering mindes to stay the brunt, Is when that men their priuate feare, And his owne dread each one doth beare. But now them all one humor drawes, The Campe takes interest in the cause, As tyranny against their lawes. They make no stoppe, for all the rout Dreadlesse run on, and cast no doubt. For still a generall offence Doth with all chastisement dispence. Then one of them amongst the rest, Their publicke griese this wise exprest. The mutinous oration of one of Cæsars Souldiers. Cæsar let vs at length in peace From wicked warre finde some release. By lands and seas thou dost deuise, To make our throats a sacrifice. And dost (as vile) expose our blood, To euery hostile raging mood. A part of vs in France were slaine, Many in these hard warres of Spaine; And Latium, some with blood did staine. So all the world our Troopes deuoures, Whilst thou displai'st thy conquering powres. But what are we the more of worth, For all that bloud shed in the North? For Rhodanus, and Rhene subdu'd, Our labours are but still renu'd. And for those warres both neere and farre All our reward is ciuill warre. Rome we haue taken, and made waste: The Senate from our Countrey chaste. What spoyles of Gods or men remaines, For vs to aske more for our paines? Yet still with rauening swords and hands Prest to all spoyle our practise stands. Patient in pouerty we pine, O when will these warres haue a fine? If Rome too little be esteem'd, What as sufficient can be deem'd? O now respect our hoary haire, Our hands that scarce can weapons beare, Our weakned arms with wounds and scarres, Our liues decayd, youth spent in warres. Their death in peace let old men take, O 'tis a strange request I make, A pittifull description of the liues of common souldiers. That dying we might not of force, Vpon the bare earth life deuorce; And with our cold caskes crush our powles, Whilst we are yeelding vp our soules: And want a hand to close our eyes When deaths last straine doth vs surprise. No wife at all by vs to moane, Nor yet to haue a graue alone, But vpon heapes in ditches cast, Let old age beded dye at last. And some thing get by Cæsars fate More then sharpe swords, and dire debate. Why dost thou (Cæsar) hope to draw Vs all as stupid vnder awe. As though we wanted sence the while To iudge of employments vile? Thinkst thou, we cannot gesse aright Vpon whom all the wracke will light? And whose liues blood shall pay the price Of all thy ciuill warres deuise. What in thy Mart effected was, But that our hands hath brought to passe? We haue done all, and what I say No law nor right can me denay. The Souldier braues Cæsar behinde his backe. Cæsar my Chiefetaine was in Gaule, My fellow here I may him call. The crime that doth coinquinate, Doth likewise yeeld men equall fate. Besides the merit of our acts, Wrong censure now from vs detracts. For whatsoeuer we haue wonne, Is deem'd by Cæsars fortune spunne. Yet let him know we are his Fate, Though he hope Ioue supports his state, For if thy Souldiers with thee iarre, Cæsar thou may'st shut vp thy warre. Thus said, in all the Campe throughout Together they doe clustring rout, And raging seeke their Captaine out. Yee Gods so did Romes forttune quaile, When piety and faith did faile, And wicked manners void of grace, In steed thereof did come in place. O let our discords raging iarres Once make an end of ciuill warres! What Captaine of the greatest spright Would not this mutiny affright? But noble Cæsar (that dares runne Into all Fates, and nothing shunne, The admirable vndaunted valour of CæsarDelighting then to try his chance, When dangerss most their threats aduance) Comes dauntlesse now with courage bold, Not staying till their fit was cold. But in the midst of all their rage, Himselfe amongst them doth ingage. He neuer would haue blam'd their fact If they had Townes or Cities sack't; Or had they reuerend Temples burn'd, Or Ioues Tarpeia ouer-turn'd. The Matrons, and the Senate spoil'd, Infants, and mothers great with child. For Cæsar would his Souldiers haue All cruelties of him to craue; And that they surely should desire The spoyle of warfare as their hire. He onely fear'd his furious troope With quiet hands would loytring droope. O Cæsar! art thou not asham'd, That still to warre thy minde is fram'd? When thine owne Armes doe thee forsake, Shall these their thirst from bloud so slake? Shall they the murdring steele disdaine, An Apostrophe to Cæsar.Whilst thou dost ruthlesse still remaine, And prosecute this impious vaine? Be weary, and learne without Armes, To suffer, and shunne ciuill harmes. Affect a life of peace at last, These heynous humors from thee cast. Cruell why dost thou still persist, Prouoking men against their list? For Cæsar thou maist plainly see, This ciuill warre thy sword doth flee. He stands vpon a little hill, His stout lookes he retaineth still. Deseruing to be fear'd of all, For that no feare could him appall. Then to this swarme his minde he breakes, And wroth doth dictate what he speakes. Souldier that so took'st on yer-while, Cæsars oration to the mutiners. And absent didst my name reuile; See heere thou hast a naked breast Ready for wounds, now do thy best, And get thee hence if fault thou finde With warres, and leaue thy Armes behinde. Sedition that such swaggering makes, And nothing manly vndertakes, Discouers but a coward minde, And such as come of crauen kinde. These youths so pamper'd vp with pray, Study but now to runne away; To sloth they would themselues bequeaue, And their victorious Captaine leaue. Be gonne, (such abiect mindes I hate) Leaue me to warre, and to my fate. These armes of mine will finde out hands, VVhen I haue casht seditious bands. Fortune with gallants will supply My weapons, that vn-vsd shall lye. Can Pompey, whom I chast away, Be follow'd with so great a sway Of Latium ships, with him to flye? And thinke you that my victory VVill not my campe with troopes supplie? Yes, and those troopes we must prefarre To haue the honor of this warre: And they will share away the gaines Of all your former-taken paines. Then shall you Veterans relent, To see your blood in vaine so spent. And when my Triumphes come in place, Your selues haue nether gifts nor grace. Thinke you that I shall losse receaue, Because that you my Campe doe leaue? Yea all as much, as if the course Of riuers, threat to change their sourse, And from the seas their streames detaine, Were able so to slake the maine, That ebs &amp; floods 'twould not maintaine. What do you now your selues perswade That you in ought my fortune made? The Gods do not their care abase To men of your inferior place. A proud Heathen conceit.They giue no leasure to their eye, To see where such men liue or dye. Of great mens Fate they haue a care, That of this world supporters are. To Spaine, and to the Northerne coast, You terrors were, led in my hoast. But had you followed Pompey then, You would haue prou'd but conquer'd men. Labienus was a valiant knight, Whilst he in Cæsars Armes did fight. But now (a run-a-way most base) Doth after a new Captaine trace, By sea and land from place to place. Your faiths to me no better are, If you shall shew your selues in warre, Of so debaushed minds to be, As neither foes nor friends to me. For he that doth my Ensignes leaue, And will not vnto Pompey cleaue, Of me no fauour can receaue. Surely the Gods my Tents protect, And will I should your fraud reiect. And that I doe vnto mee call New troopes to wage this warre withall. O Fortune! how dost thou enlarge My weary shoulders of a charge? To giue me meanes now to despise Those hands, whose hopes nought can suffise; No not the whole worlds spoyle and pelfe, But I will warre now for my selfe: Therefore from out my Campe depart, And those braue Ensignes of my Mart, Yee slothfull Romans lay them downe, They shall be borne with more renowne. And now the Authors of this rage, Iustice, not Cæsar, doth engage. Prostrate your selues therefore with speed, And on the blocke receiue your meed: Punishment for the mutiny. For of this mutinous deuice, Your faithlesse heads must pay the price. And you new Souldiers, on whose hands The strength now of my Army stands; Behold these paines, learne lawes of Armes, Know how to dye for factious harmes. The common rout whilst thus he spake, Vnder his threatning voyce did quake. And this great bragging factious troope, That might haue made one head to droop, Vnto his will with awe did stoope, The awe that Cæsars Souldiers stood in of their General. As though the very swords conspir'd To yeeld to what his will requir'd: And that the steele it selfe in spight Of hands, would yeeld him duties right. Yet Cæsars selfe did stand in doubt, That most of all the armed rout Would haue maintain'd their cause in field, And not to execution yeeld. But yet their patience past the scope Of their offended Captaines hope: For they not onely held them still, But gaue their throats vnto his will. Then did he feare that their sterne hearts Inur'd before to ruthlesse parts, Would now grow dull, vnfit for Marts. Loe thus did Iustice direfull stroke The mutiny appeased. To former peace their mindes reuoke. Chiefe Mutiners receiu'd their paine, The rest restor'd to grace againe. Cæsars Armie goes to Brundusium.The Army then directed was, Thence to Brundusium to passe In ten daies march, and there to meet The Mariners, and Cæsars fleet. Some of them cal'd from Hydrus bay, And from old Taras, where they lay: Others from Leucas secret shores, And those in Salapin, that Moores, With some that did in Sipus ride, Whose streams neere to those cliffes do tide Where the Apulian Gargan hill Fruitfull to husband men that till, Stretching along Ausonia's soyles, By North Dalmatia entoyles. And on the South Calabria bounds, Thence like a Promontory rounds Into the Adriaticke sounds. Meane while doth Cæsar take his way Cæsar comes againe to Rome.To fearefull Rome, taught to obay. In peacefull gowne, the victors minde; His armed troopes he left behind: And there the people by request, In signe of loue, would needs inuest Him with the high Dictators name, And Consulship ioyn'd to the same. Obseru'd with ioyfull solemne feasts, And suffrages to his owne hests So generally, as that before, Neuer was any flattered more, With Lordly phrase him to adore. And for to grace with iust pretence His warre, as for the states defence; The swords that they before him beare, With Consuls axes mingled were. And where the Ægles Ensignes waue, He ioynes the Faggots ribbond braue. Cæsar made Dictator and Consull at one time.And so vsurpes, with idle fame Of Empires rule, Dictators name. Thus markes he out that wofull time With worthy Titles free from crime. And so to giue Pharsalia's fight The colour of a quarrell right. That yeare the Consuls name he hends, And publique good his cause pretends. To solemne shewes in Martius fields, A forced fained forme he yeelds; The peoples voyces he obtaines, For will, or nill, powre them constraines. The Tribes he partially diuides, With shew the Vrne the lots decides. The heauenly signes no credit beares, Thunders moues not the Augures eares. They sweare the birds with good lucke flye, Whilst dismall Owles are heard to crye. So breach of lawes that high powre stain'd, Which reuerence had so long maintein'd. And that times names mightfull agree With his designes, he doth decree A monthly Consull. A monthly Consull to install, Distinguish't with times festiuall. And that high powre that Latium brights, Should haue his Ceremoniall rites Perform'd by Torches in the nights, Though sacred honours scarce were due To Ioue, that nought our wrackes did rue. From Rome then Cæsar hastes away, Through those low meads that yeelds the hay That the Apulian people makes With handy pitchforkes, and with rakes. And in his speed he is more swift Then is the flash of lightnings drift, Or Tyger of the female kinde, Vntill the houses he doe finde Of Crætan frames, Brundusium hight, Where with the aires tempestuous spight He findes the hauens mouth winde-bound, And trembling barkes within the sound, No dangers must hinder Cæsars designes With winters stormes like to be drownd. But yet this daring Captaine thinkes That shamefully his businesse shrinkes, If doubts, or dreads should him delay, Or him confine within a bay. Whilst that he sees the tossing maine Is scour'd by Pompey's lucklesse traine, And to adde courage to their sprites, His mariners he thus incites. The Northerne sky, and winters winde Cæsar exhorts his mariners to take the seaWe alwayes doe more certaine finde; And current of the Ocean vast, Continue with more constant blast, When once they take, then those slight puffes Which from the chopping changing huffes Of the spring season do proceede, Either for certainty or speede. Besides, our course needs not to feare How sore the seas do breake and teare: We need not gaze for markes of lands, Whereby to void the rockes and sands. But with a forth-right leading winde, By North we shall our harbour finde. And would to God this Northerne racke, Would whirle to make the mast to cracke, And fill the sailes with such a gale, To make the top-mast stoope withall; A stout request.And bring vs to the Greekish shores, That Pompey's Gallies, with their Oares, May not in calmes our fleet surprise, Whilst in the seas it hulling tries. Therefore my hearts your Anchors way, Doe not our happy fleet delay: For all this while we loose but time, Since windes and seas are in their prime. Now Phœbus falles vnto his rest, And brightest starres the skies invest; When Cinthia shewes her siluer eye, The ships out of the harbour flye. With Anchors weigh'd, and Cables coyl'd, Amongst the waues the Sea-men toyl'd. They hoise their yards a crosse the mast, And then to take the friendly blast, Their climing feet their hands pursue To cut their sailes, and spreade their clue. But for the winde they gan to doubt, Their top-sailes likewise they heaue out, With all their helpes they can deuise, To take the least breath of the skies. Yet now more slowly slides the racke, And all their sailes began to slacke; Wherewith came on such slender blasts, That sailes did flat vnto the masts. Of land no sooner they lost sight, Cæsar becalmed. But they were all becalm'd out-right. The gale that blew off from the shore, At sea did follow them no more. The rowling billowes of the deepe Were now growne calme, and still a sleepe. The waues all smooth, were as but one, The maine scarce felt a motion. So Bosphorus doth dully stand, Bound with the flawes of Schythia land. When Istar cannot moue that maine Which freezing vapours doe restraine, An ycie sea. That sea becomes an ycie plaine: And ships brought thither by the windes, In beddes of yce fast lockt it bindes. So as the men by toyle, nor Art, Can make a way thence to depart. Whose waues condensed with the cold The hugie weight of Carts do hold. With hollow sound that thereon runne, And there the Besseans doe wonne, Vntill Meotis feele the Sunne. With such a froward still, the deepes A soft and sluggish wallowing keepes; As if in slumber they did rest, And of their nature dispossest. And like a standing poole growne sad, That neither spring nor motion had; But changed from his nature quite, Forgotten had his wonted plight. For he will neither rise nor fall, Nor with his wonted roaring call; He trembles not, nor frothing chides, Nor Phœbæs influence giues him tides. This fleet meane while with much disease, Lay tumbling in this dead growne seas. On this side did the aduerse fleet Prepare their oares with them to meet, Whilst they in this dead calme do ride, And could not moue with winde or tide. The dangers of Cæsars fleet by a calme.On th' other side they stood in dread, And danger to be famished. So as in this disasterous state New feares, new praiers eleuate. Vpon the Gods they call and cry, That all the fury of the sky Would bend it selfe to boysterous rage, And so the stupid waues engage, As that the fury of the maine Would shew it selfe a sea againe. But winde nor waues became so stout, That they of ship-wracke need to doubt. Yet after when the night was past, The day with clouds was ouer-cast. The hollow seas began to sturre, And then Ceraunia windes did whurre, Wherewith the fleet began to quake, And so the aire the sailes did shake, At length the crooke-back't waues did rise, And in the sternes the ships surprise, Cæsor arriues with his Army at Palesta in Greece, where Pompey lay encamped.That with full sailes now forward plies. So as these friendly seas and gales, Them to Palestes hauens hales: Where when they safely were arriu'd, They Anchors cast, with ioy reviu'd. This was the first confronting coast, Where these two Captaines hoast to hoast, Incamped were in eithers view. And through these fields two riuers drew Their pleasant streames, on Apsus hight, And Genusus, more swift of flight. Apsus by reason of a lake, That into her his course did make, With steady slye sought stealing pace, Could shipping beare from place to place. But swift Genusus head-long goes, When as the Sunne melts heapes of snowes, Or that the falles of showring raines, Her swollen channels higher straines. Yet neither of them with long race, Within the land doth winding trace. Fortune to this place gaue the fame Of two braue Captaines great in name: And here the worlds vaine hope decay'd, That now their furies could be stay'd; Since that the stations were so nye, Cæsars &amp; Pompeys Campe confront each other. Where now they both incamped lye; That each might others face behold, And heare the tale each other told. And many yeares were past betweene Since thou great Pompey last had seene That loued father-in-law of thine; And did so neere a league combine Of strict alianc'd blood with blood, Though froward Fate the same with-stood. When Cæsars daughter reft of life His sonne-in-law made fit for strife. And but vpon the Nylus shore, He after saw thy head no more. Now Cæsars thoughts were much dismaid That many troopes still lingring staid: Which for this place were ready prest, And (straightly charg'd by his owne hest, With speed to meet him on that coast) Doth vexe to see warres time so lost. The leading of these wanting bands Cæsar troubled with the delayes of Antonius. Was vnder fierce Antonius hands. Who now (belike) did meditate Vpon his owne Leucadian fate. Cæsar on him calles with intreates, And checkes his staying thus with threats. O thou that in the world dost cause Cæsars messages to Antonius.Such mischifes by thy tedious pause. VVhy holdst thou both the Gods and Fates, Suspenced from our happy dates. By mine owne speede and proper care All other things dispatched are; And Fortune now doth call for thee, That thy right hand might aiding be: The chiefest seruice to intend That must our prosperous warfare end. No Lybicke Syrts, nor doubtfull deepes Vs in this sort a sunder keepes. VVe doe not seeke with new deuice Thy armed troopes now to entice Into an vnknowne desperate maine. O no thou sluggish idle swaine, Cæsar bids thee to come, not goe, I lead the way, and pierc'd the foe Throughout these stranger seas and sands, And safely haue conuaid my bands. My tents art thou afraid to see? This timelesse hap is death to me. Cæsar taxeth Antonius with backwardnesseMy words are spent to waues and winde, Yet do not thou their humors binde That to the seas are well inclin'd. For if I bee not much deceau'd, Thy Troopes so truely haue bequeau'd To Cæsars Armes their might and maine, That shipwracks doubt they would disdaine. And dolours voyce now must I vse, Thou dost thy selfe to much abuse. The whole worlds hopes twixt thee and me, Yet in no equall ballance be; Cæsar doth in Epyrus Campe, A iealous speech.And there is all the Senates stampe: VVhilst onely thou (so vncontrol'd) Dost but Ausonia's limits hold. VVhen Cæsar thus had twice or thrice Reprou'd him for his loytring vice, And saw that he so oft did spend His treats, and threats vnto no end. But Fortunes fauours thus neglects, That his successe so much protects. He vndertakes ('gainst this despight) To make a strange attempt by night. And maugre frights of seas mischance, He dreadlesse doth himselfe aduance. VVhilst sterne Antonius so did feare, So oft commanded to be there. For Cæsar saw his rash attempts Fortune from danger still exempts: Fortune Cæsars friend. And now he hopes with passage good, To furrow through the raging flood, Embarked in a Fisher-boate, VVhen ships could scarce in safety floate. Now had the silent night with rest From care of Armes freed euery breast, And slumbring soules with sweet repose Their eyes in quyet thoughts doe close. And those most soundly take their ease, Whom lowly pouerty can please. Now all the Campe dead silent binne, The second watch did new beginne. VVhen Cæsar with a carefull pace Alongst the whusted guards did trace; Cæsar vnknown steales out of his Campe. Not of his owne attendants heard, VVhen his owne Tent he first vnspard. Fortune was then his mate alone; So through the Campe he past vnknowne, VVho now were all possest with sleepe, But scarce good watch the while they keepe. And he dislik't this fault to see, Negligence in a Campe. That they could so surprised be. He romes about the crooked shores, VVhere he a creeke at length explores: And there a fisher-boate did ride, That by a sturdy rope was tide. The owner of this pelting skiffe Hard vnder-neath a craggy cliffe, Not farre from thence had his poore coate; The bottome of a rotten boate A description of a Fishermans cottage.Was all his roofe; and for the side Twas made of platted bul-rush dry'd, Combin'd with canes and fenny flagges; And on no stronger proppes it swagges. Cæsar knockes at the Fishermans doore.Here Cæsar with his fist so knockes, That therewithall this cottage rockes, And did Amyclas frighted wake, Who soundly then his rest did take; But now his soft couch doth forsake. Amiclas speechWhose there (q?? he) what shipwrackt wight Beates at my doore this time of night? What wretched man my helpe doth craue? Or who can hope reliefe to haue Of this base cottage where I wonne? Great Fortune doth such corners shunne. Thus said, he hastes a fire to make, And doth the heaped ashes rake, Some kindled sparkles to finde out, And them with dry leaues strawes about: And so with blowing kindles flame, Whilst he of warres feares not the name. He knew his simple home was free, His house no prey of worth could be For souldiers spoyles, or ciuill strife. The happy &amp; secure estate of poore-men O safe and blessed poore mans life! O sweet secured quiet state! This pretious gift, and heauenly fate, That on meane wights the Gods bestow, The mighty ones do scarcely know. VVhat Cities walles, or strongest Forts VVhen Cæsars hand beates at the ports, Could like security possesse? But that some fright they would expresse. His little wicket he sets ope; Then Cæsar gaue his speech this scope: Cæsars words to poore Amyclas.Yong man (quoth he) aduance thy hope Beyond the thoughts thou canst conceaue, Fortunes full bounties now receaue. If my directions thou obay, And to Hesperia me conuay, A Skippars trade thou shalt not need, Nor toyle in age with hungry feed. Spare not therefore thy wealth to raise, Since that the Gods shew thee the wayes: And (whilst thou maist) receiue that Fate, Which will for euer store thy state. So Cæsar said; for though but clad In rusticke habit like a swad, Yet could he not his tongue constraine Cæsars naturall inclination to speake like a Prince. In speech to vse a priuate vaine. Then poore Amyclas thus replies, Too many dangers vs denies, Amiclas speech to Cæsar, describing the signes of foule weather at sea To trust this raging sea by night; For first I mark't the sunnes last light, When he declin'd to Thetis bed, His face was nothing flaming red. But his bright beames contracted were; The Sunne. For on the middle of his spheare, A foggy cloud his face did hide: So as his beames it did diuide. One part of them did Northward bend, The other to the Southward tend. And meane while in the midst he quail'd, And setting pale, his brightnesse fail'd. So as his beames did not offend The lookers eyes his face that kend. And when the Moone did mount the skies, With sharpned hornes she did not rise. The Moone. Nor did her hollownesse appeare VVithin her Orbe right azure cleare. Nor as she wont in calmy night, Her hornes thin toppes did beare vpright. But (that which is a signe of winde) Her colour was to red inclin'd. And with a faintie pallid looke, VVith dull aspect, a cloud she tooke. Besides the murmure of the woods, The rut and rocking of the floods Diuers signes of a tempest.I doe not like; nor this signe neither, The tumbling Dolphins boad foule weather. The Cormorant me no whit likes, That he vnto the dry land seekes. And that he takes delight To trust his wings with towring flight, That naturally affects the waues: His head the Sea-crow often laues, As though that he some stormes attends, And on the low shores ietting wends. But if it be thine owne desire, And vrgent cause doe haste require, Il'e giue thee all the helpe I may, To bring thee to thy wished bay: And where thou bidst we land will touch, Or windes and seas shall faile me much. He ends his tale, and therewithall The fastned cable in they hale; And with the winde his sailes lets flye, Cæsar puts to the sea in a little Fisherboate.But with their motion suddenly: Not onely ouer all the deepes, Huge flaming streames from starers downe sweepes. Spearsing in furrowes through the skye, But those chiefe fixed starres on hye, That next the pole doe stand so nye, Did sensibly appeare to shake. Then did a blacke mist ouer-rake The vast wilde backe of Neptunes maine, And with a long stretcht rowling traine, The threatning billowes sparkling burne, The windes vncertainly did turne. And by the swelling waues they finde, The hollow seas were fil'd with winde. Then quoth the Pilot of this barge, See how this tempest doth enlarge. Besides we cannot certaine finde, Amyclas words to Cæsar.Yet from what quarter blowes the winde. Whether from out the South, or East, In no place he doth constant rest. Againe, if we the rut doe marke Which in the sea doth murmuring barke, A North-west winde it signifies, Which slat our course to Latium stries. So as no meanes we haue to tacke That way, nor on that coast to wracke. This desperate course we must reiect, If we our safety will respect: And cast about to lay the land, From whence we now directly stand, Before our Skiffe bee too much tost, And we too farre runne from the coast. But Cæsar scornes that he doth say, Hoping all perils will giue way To his attempts; and tels him plaine No fury of the winde, or maine, Cæsars answere to Amyclas. For feare shall make him turne againe. If froward skies be all thy feare For Italy, that fault I'le beare. Thy onely dread and doubt doth grow, Because (poore soule) thou dost not know Who 'tis that with thee now doth saile, Whom Fortune neuer yet did faile. But she would thinke she did me wrong To hold backe my desires so long. Therefore passe boldly through this rage, Secured in my safe presage. This is but toyle of windes and seas, Which shall no whit our barke disease. Thy ship for fraight doth Cæsar beare, To free thee from the Oceans feare. And these fierce windes that blow so hye, Shall be appeased by and by: And euen the very raging maine, Shall by our ship his quiet gaine. Thy course in no case see thou change, But from a loofe, this next shore range. And then beleeue thou shalt attaine Calabria coast, and end thy paine. When no lands else beneath the skye Cæsars conceit of Fortunes fauours to him.Doth for our ship and safety lye. Thou little knowst that all these threates That so the waues with tempests beates, Is but that Fortune would declare To me her tender loue and care, VVhen skies and seas most furious are. The word he had no sooner spoke, But from a cloud a whirle-winde broke The cordage and the tackling rownd, So that the sailes aloft did bound, And whirle about the tottring mast, The ships ioynts open with the blast: And all the perils of the earth VVere here deliuered at a birth. For first from the Atlanticke maine, The billowes rowl'd with westerne straine. And when they had this sea ingag'd, Against the rockes they roar'd and rag'd. VVith that comes in the Northerne blast, VVhich doth the waues repell as fast; So as the seas did stand at stay VVhich of the two they should obay. But yet the rauing Scithian flawes, Did wrest the waues vnto his lawes. And so the Oceans bottome rakes, A description of a furious Tempest.That in the sands it path-way makes. Neither did Boreas with his freate Against the cliffes the billowes beate; But euen against those raging waues, That with the Westerne Tempest raues. And now the seas are growne so hye, That waue against the waue doth flye, Although the winde doe calmed lye. But yet the East-winde did not cease His fury likewise to expresse: Neither thinke I that in this storme, The South-winde did his blasts conforme To milder mood, with showres supprest, And still in Æols dungeon rest. But that the windes from euery part, Incensed were to striuing Mart. A description of enraged seas. And that each one exprest his most, To blow the billow from his cost, And twixt them held the maine embost. For now the lesser seas likewise In mutiny began to rise. Th' Ægean gainst the Tyrrhen waues, Impetuously resisting raues. And the Ionian roaring vease, Confronts the Adriaticke seas. How oft that day were steepy rockes Cleane ouerturn'd with whirle-wind shocks? Gainst which the billowes beate in vaine, And could not such huge mountains straine, As quite did ouer-whelmed lye, Whose towring toppes did threat the skye. Neuer (I thinke) did any shore, Endure the like sea-storme before: Nor any clime twixt either pole, Did from her coasts such billowes role. These seas where they the lands surrownd, In diuers parts with indraughts drown'd. So did high Ioue in former times, Weari'd with scourging worldly crimes, His thunder-bolts at last forbeare, And causd his brothers Trydent speare To helpe him vengeance due to take, He meanes Neptunes and Deucalions flood. Which did a second Empire make: When Nations were in waters drownd, And Thætis would admit no bound Vnto the lands, but heauens high cope; Those that saile to the west Indies, do sometimes meet with the like falles of raine in whole clouds, wherewith ships are often drownd: they are called by the Spaniards, the Huricanos; and by our men, the Spouts. Neither could that haue beene her scope. But to the starres it would haue rose, If Iupiter did not oppose, And her with weighty clouds foreclose. This night was not the heauens night, But hellish darke depriuing light. And thickned with such clouds of showres, That whole vnparted downe-right powres, So as the feared lightning flash, And his swift brightnesse, it did quash. The clouded aire becomes obscure, The conuex spheares quakings endure. The Axle that the world sustaines, Doth sound aloud with cracking straines. The ioynts and structures of the poles VVith labouring motion tottring roles. Chaos.Nature suspects the Chaos old, And that discording vncontrold The Elements againe would warre, And in their harmony would iarre. Right Paganisme. And that with Gods, the fiends of hell Would now all mingled be pell-mell. One onely signe some hope did giue, That in this storme this barke could liue. But looke how farre the distance showes, Downe where the pleasant Ocean flowes, To him that on the top doth stand Of mount Leucades lofty land: Euen so the trough of seas appear'd To him that now the rudder stear'd: When as the ship was borne aloft The billowes of a wrought sea described.With swelling of the billow soft. And when againe she did descend Betweene the billowes, as they bend; So hollow in the furrow lies, As that her mast is hid from eies. Sometimes as high as clouds her sailes, Sometimes her keele the bottome trailes. For where the sea doth breake a sunder, The sands are bared that lye vnder. And when the parted billowes filles, They rise in heapes like mighty hilles. Feare now all hope of Art exceedes, To guide the helme the maister dreads: To port, or weare, or serue the seas, The labouring ship he cannot ease. Onely by this they did suruiue, The waues so contrary did striue, As that it kept the ship vpright Betwixt them both with equall might. For as one billow downe did straine, Another check't him vp againe. And by this meanes not ouer-set With euery surge aloft they get. Sason, an Iland between Brundusium and Epirus. Of Sasons shelues, and lowly sand, Nothing at all in feare they stand. Nor yet of the Thessalian shore, Whose crooked strands the pibbles store. A Citty of Epirus. Nor yet Ambracia's noysome bay, Where ships so oft are cast away. But that which feares these sea-men most, Is the high-clift Cæraunian cost. A mountaine in Epirus, that runs into the seas. Now Cæsar thinkes this dangerous state, Is worthy to confront his fate. How now (quoth he) are powers Diuine So troubled with this life of mine, As that they should such care bestow How they the same might ouer-throw? That sailing in this trifling boat Such monstrous seas together float. If that the glory of my end Vnto the seas the Fates do lend, Cæsars braue resolution in this tempest. And warres no more we must intend; Yee Gods aboue, with dreadlesse minde, I take what death you haue design'd: Although this hastned date preuents The finishing of braue euents. But I haue done acts great enow, I made the Northerne Nations bow. A briefe relation of Cæsars atchieuem?ts. The forces of my enemy For feare of mee I made to flye. And Rome it selfe doth plainly see, Pompey a second is to mee. The fagots me by warre deny'd, With peoples voyce to me were cry'd. No Titles of the Roman state, Haue wanted to adorne my Fate. And no wight now but thou alone Fortune onely of Cæsars co?saile. Fortune, to whom my vowes are knowne, Shall know the secrets of my will; For though that I haue had my fill Of honors, and enioy the grace Of Consull, and Dictators place: And so to Stygian shades will trace. Cæsar shewes how he desires to dye.O yet tis my desire to dye In priuate sort, and secretly. O Heauens! no funerals I craue, Let my torne body for a graue Be kept amidst the weltring waue. Both fires and mournings me deny, Whereby my fame the more shall flye. For no man witting of my end, All coasts with dread will me attend. So hauing said, the surging whifts The ship ten times together lifts, And (that which wondrous is to say) She on the waues top still did stay; And did not downe decline againe: But with a sweeping billowes straine, Cæsar cast a shore in his boat.The barke was cast vpon the sands, Whereas their last forsaken lands, Doth make a narrow hollow bay, And there a shore doe safely stay. Here at one cast againe possest With all his Fortune, so much blest: And with so many stately Townes, Such Cities, and such Regall Crownes: But Cæsar thus return'd againe, And Phœbus rising from the maine, He could not so himselfe conceale, Cæsar returnes againe to his Campe.As when he from his Campe did steale, And all his Army did deceaue. For now about him clustring cleaue His loyall troopes, to see his face, But teares a while all ioy did chase, And then their Chieftaine they reproue With such complaints as grow from loue. Stout Cæsar, whither now (quoth they) Did thy rash valour thee convey? And to what Fate (when thou wert fled) The c?plaint of Cæsars souldiers. VVere we poore soules abandoned? VVhy didst thou to vnwilling waues Thy body giue, where danger raues? VVhen thou well knowst how many frends VVhat peoples safeties, liues and ends, Onely vpon thy Fate depends. And that the world with loue and dread, Hath chosen thee her soueraigne head. Tis inhumanity (I say) Life wilfully to cast away. VVas none of vs of that desart, VVith thee in this to share a part? Of all thy friends that yet remaine, In this wouldst thou no one retaine? Dead sleepe (alas) did vs deceaue, VVhilst that the seas did thee bereaue: And thereof we are much asham'd, But must this cause therefore be blam'd, That thou didst seeke Hesperia land? A desperate deed thou took'st in hand, In such fierce cruell stormes as these To trust thy selfe with raging seas. In most extreames, and last of all When doubtfull wrackes we would fore-stall, Then men are wont (to cut off strife) Stoutly to end a loathsome life. But thou with all this worlds good blest, The seas must be therewith possest. Why weariest thou the Gods aboue? Fortune hath shewd her care and loue Cæsar taxed for abusing the fauours of Fortune, and the care of the Gods. Sufficient, if she do no more But thy safe landing on the shore. And this may serue, thee to debarre From hoped fortune in thy warre. No better vse can Cæsar make Of that great care the Gods do take For his affaires, the earth that swaies, And to whose heast all men obayes? Then that such grace they him behight To be a happy ship-wrack't wight? But whilst they thus expostulate, The sunne his beames doth eleuate: And so breakes off this dire complaint, The swelling seas now growing faint With huge turmoyle; her waues deprest, When as the windes were laid to rest. And then the leaders of those bands, That lay so long in Latium lands, Antonius brings his bands from Italy to Cæsar by sea.Seeing the maine now spent with rage, And cleansing Boreas did asswage The lowring gusts of seas and sky, They loosd their ships the waues to trye. Which long and oft had tryall made Twixt sailers skilfull in their trade, And the resisting stubborne windes, Which so each other equall bindes, That they the broad seas could not scoure, And come to Cæsar with their power. But now a boord the Souldiers get, The ships in order they are set. When as the night with froward gale, Kept Mariners they could not hale Their tackes aboord, nor ply their sailes, Amongst the ships all order failes. So do the Cranes in strained rankes, When they forsake Strimonian bankes, Shunning the rage of winters frost, Go seeke their drinke on Nylus coast. And when they first beginne their flight, Their rankes so orderly they dight, That diuers figures they retaine, Whilst they throughout the aire doe straine; Vntill at length some Southerne blast Amongst their wings his puffes do cast: Wherewith they are inforc'd to flye A higher pitch in windy skye. And then confusdly do begin To breake their order filed thin. In clusters soaring round together, Framing their flight to serue the wether. And puts the letter out of square, Whose forme in flying first they bare. But with the dauning of the day, The winde began to beare a sway, Stir'd with the sight of Phœbus face: And now it hath this fleete in chase. Which as it saild, did striue in vaine, Lissus, a Cittie of Macedon. The shores of Lissus to attaine. But yet that land they could not lay, Till North-winde gaue the South-winde way. And to Nymphæus port did guide Nymphæus, a Port towne of Macedon. The fleet, which Boreas blast deny'd, In keeping backe the checking tide. Now Pompey sees prouision made From sundry coasts him to inuade. And Cæsars force at point to Arme, From euery place about him swarme. So as his Campe must now withstand The daily garboyles neere at hand. He doth resolue to place a part His nuptiall care, secure from Mart. And vnto Lesbos meanes to send Cornelia, Pompey's wife, daughter to Scipio. His faire Cornelia, there to spend This bloody time, remote a farre From clattring Armes, and noyse of warre. Good God, how iust loue rules and bindes Those men that are of worthy mindes. Loue so in Pompey breedes remorce, That dread and doubt doe warres diuorce. For now Cornelia is the cause That he himselfe a while with-drawes, From hazarding the doubtful scarre Of Fortune, in this ciuill warre, When all the world and Roman state Was now exposd to martiall Fate. He now wants words to shew his minde, And to delayes is whole enclin'd. Whereby he may protract euent, And trifle Fate in loue-time spent, Now when the night was almost past, And sleepy rest had lent his last To slumbring eyes, Cornelia than Sweetly embracing her good man, Seeking withall his lippes to smacke, Whose breast deep cares did strain &amp; rack To her the whiles he turnes his back. When wounded she with blinded feares, Seeing his eyes besprent with teares, Durst not desire the cause to learne, Nor seeme she did his teares discerne. Then sighing, thus he said; Deare wife, To me more pleasing then my life, Pompeys words to Cornelia.Whilst I in happy state did liue; But now dost cause of sorrow giue, Since that the heauy day I see, That our sweet ioyes must parted bee. Too short a date for our delight: Though all to long to stay from fight. For Cæsar now is ready prest, And warre is onely in request, During which time, Lesbos shall be A safe retiring place for thee. Forbeare requests to me to make, I haue resolu'd this course to take. And haue denyd mine owne desire, Thou shalt not long from me retire. But things are now in desperate chaunce, And when as ruine doth aduance, The greatest states must lead the daunce. It may suffise thee still to heare When perils are to Pompey neare. But sure thy loue deceiues me farre, If thou affect to see this warre. How fouly I might be asham'd That now for Mart haue all things fram'd; Pompey's perswasions to his wife.To sleepe securely with my wife, Sequestred from this ciuill strife? And when the sounding Trumpets shall The wretched world to battaile call, That Pompey then with drowsie eyes, Should from thy tender bosome rise. To wofull Pompey 'twere a skorne, That he no preiudice hath borne Amongst the rest, in ciuill strife, Nor bard so much as of his wife. But thou meane while shalt liue secure From perils that the rest indure. And safer then great Kings can bee; For being thus remou'd from me, Fortune shall neuer thee perplex With those great cares that must me vex. But if the Gods will haue it so, That we be conquerd by our foe; Pompey tearms his wife the best part of himselfe. My best part yet shall safe remaine. Or if the fates doe me constraine The cruell victors force to shunne; Then know I whither safe to runne. The grieued dame waxt faint and pale When she had heard this heauy tale. Her sences rapted in a sound, Sorrow a while did her confound: Vntill her voyce was come againe, And then did murmuring thus complaine. Cornelia perplexed with Pompeys words sorrowfully replies. No cause (deere Pompey) I doe finde, To thinke the Fates, or Gods vnkinde, For wronging of our nuptiall bed: Our liues haue happily beene led. Death doth not separate our loue, Nor funerals need we to proue. But that now (as the common sort) I should be held from my consort. And like the base Plebeian rout, From thee I should be so cast out It grieues my soule; what must our foe With his approch worke me such woe? Thy father-in-law we honor doe To breake this league betwixt vs two. VVhat, is the loue that I haue showne To Pompey, yet no better knowne? Think'st thou that ought so safe can bee, As thy deere selfe is vnto mee? Haue not we still, with mutuall hearts, Withstood all scornes, and Fortunes thwarts? And wilt thou cruell now me leaue, And (sep'rate from thee) so bequeaue My carefull head to ruines state, And to a thundring fearefull Fate? Thinkst thou, thou dost my life protect, Whil'st my desire thou dost reiect? As though to me a harme it were, With thee in perils part to beare. No, no; for whilst I draw my breath, Cornelia's deere affection to Pompey.I'le follow thee vnto the death. And after thee so long surviue, Vntill the heauy fame arriue Vpon this farre remoued shore; But after that will liue no more. Meane while thou dost but me inure To Destinies, and to endure. O pardon me (confesse I must) In this I feare my strength to trust. But if my prayers may take place, Or that the Gods doe rue my case, Cornelia's petition.Let thy poore wife know last of all, What euer Fortune shall befall. For though at last thou conquest gaine, Perplext yet shall I still remaine. And Lesbos will hold me in awe, Though thou thy sword with conquest draw. For I as much shall stand in doubt, That Cæsar being put to rout, Will (flying in a desp'rate case) Cornelia's doubt.Surprise me in this strengthlesse place. This coast will now bee more of fame, So honor'd with my noble name: Who will not know that place the while, Where Pompey's wife liues in exile? For euery one when serues the winde, Mitelen, a citty in Lesbos.The way to Mitelen will finde. But now I make this last request, Cornelia's last request to Pompey. If thou in battaile be distrest, And that thy conquer'd Armes thou leaue And safety must by flight receaue: If thou thy selfe to seas bequeaue; O let thy lucklesse vessell striue, On any shore first to arriue, Then on this coast to seeke reliefe; Such meeting would encrease our griefe. Thus said, as one distract with dread, Inrag'd she leaues her loathed bed, And her prouides to haste away, Cornelia's impatient sorrow Impatient of her griefes delay. Her Pompey (ere she left the place) She did not kisse with sweet embrace: Nor yet her armes she euer twinde About his necke, with fauours kinde, So to relieue his grieued minde. So quail'd the last fruit of that loue, Which they before so long did proue. Outragiously they both lament, Their streaming teares their bosomes drent. And neither of them had the heart To say, Farewell, when they should part. Neuer had they in all their life, Endured such a storme of strife. All other harmes that could betide, Pompey &amp; Cornelia more troubled with this parting, then when Cæsar chased them out of Italy. With constant mindes they did abide. The haplesse dame the place doth leaue, And then her traine did her receaue. And to the seas doe her conuay, Where on the sands she prostrate lay, And to the bankes she clinged fast, But her aboord they bare at last. They did not with such heauy plight, At that time leaue their Countries sight, Nor from Hesperian coast depart When Cæsars Armes did make them start; Great Pompeys faithfull wife doth this Forsake her Lord without a kisse: And from him flies, now left alone, But both of them doe part in moane. When night approch't she could not sleepe, Cold then did her long waking keepe; Not vsd before to widdow'd bed, From cares she could not weane her head. Nor take her rest alone to lye, Her husbands sides not being by. How oft could she (but all in vaine) When sleepe her tender eyes did straine, With armes deceau'd, hugge and embrace The empty bed in Pompey's place? And now forgetfull of her flight, Did seeke to finde her Pheare by night. For though her feruent deere desire Her heart and marrow sets on fire, Yet tooke she not delight to spread Her limbes throughout the cooling bed. But still that side reserued free, Fearing he should vnfurnish't be. But oh! the Gods did not prouide That so great ioy should her betide. For now the fatall day drawes neere, That she (poore soule) shall see her deere Repaire to her with heauy cheere. Finis Libri quinti. The sixth Booke. The Argvment. Vnto Dyrachium Pompey goes, Which guards him safely from his foes. Then Cæsar with a mighty wall, Doth Pompey's Army round enthrall; But hee breakes out by open fight. Scæua's braue minde, and manly might. Then Thessalies description showne, And what her old Records makes knowne. There Sextus, Pompey's worthlesse childe, With sorceries himselfe defil'd: And doth Erictho's counsell take, Which shee learnes from the Stygian lake. And doth a carkas raise, that telles Much future wracke, and heauy spelles. Thus hauing serued Sextus turne, The speaking carkas she doth burne. When these two Campes were lodg'd so nye, Confronting in each others eye, The two Armies in sight of each other. Their Armes and Ensignes glittring stand, Brauing vpon the hilles at hand: And both the Captaines prone to fight, Hauing assembled all their might, The Gods each parties then beheld, Of forces equall in the field. Cæsars desires not to winne townes but to fight once for all.But Cæsar holds it in disdaine, The citties of the Greekes to gaine: And doth his Destinie debarre, To value that successe in warre. For nothing now could giue him rest, Vntill that Pompey were supprest. But doth affect with what he may To giue the world one bloody day. And thereby all to ruine bring That of his name the earth might ring. The Fates indifferent threw the dice, Which of their heads should pay the price. Thrice Cæsar all his troopes displaide, Vpon the hils rang'd and arraide; And thrice prouoking signes had showne, Of ioyning battell with his fone. Cæsar could not prouoke Pompey to ioyn battell.But when at last he plainly saw To fight he could not Pompey draw, Who in his Campe more trust reposde, That with a trench was strongly closde. His tents and ensignes he did raise, And secretly through bushie wayes, With all the hast he could deuise, He marcht Dyrachyum to surprise; Cæsar remoues to Dyrachyum and Pompey followes him.But Pompey knowing his intent, By Seas doth this designe preuent. And on a hill that Petra hight, He lodge his Campe by his foresight. So to defend Dyrachyum wals, Which Cæsar sought to make his thrals, Although this Citties towres were strong To haue repulsed any wrong. Yet her best strength and rampars stands Not by the worke of ancient hands, That bulwarkes fram'd by art and toyle, The description of Dyrachyum.With clustred heapes digd from the soyle. (Although such structures mightie power Nor war, nor time can well deuoure.) But it was strongly fortifi'd, All Engines forces to abide, By onely helpe of Natures hands, And by the seate whereon it stands. For tis almost inclosed round With a maine sea, large and profound. And craggy steepe cliffes tottring hye, 'Gainst which the roaring billowes flye: And but by this hill hindered, With sea it would be Ilanded. The walles foundations are of Rockes, Most dangerous for ship-wracke shockes. When as the Southerne raging blasts, Th' Ionian furious waues vp casts. For Temples then, and houses shake, And froth of seas their toppes ore-rake. Hither the haynous hopes of warre, Drew Cæsars rage; his foes to barre. But when he saw their troopes at large, Disperst on euery mountaines varge. He vnawares to them, assaies Farre off a mighty trench to raise: And brings it with a compasse round, Enclosing many a mile of ground. The lands he measures with his eye, And so casts vp a Rampart hye; Not onely fram'd of earth and clay, But hugie rockes therein doth lay. And stones from flinty quarries dig'd, The Græcian houses he vnrig'd, And goodly walles in peeces shakes, Wherewith this lofty trench he makes So sollid, and so firme withall, That it would neither sway nor fall, With force of battery, neere or farre, Of Rammes, or Engines for the warre. A huge trench raised by Cæsar to enclose Pompeys Army. Downe go the hilles hand ouer head, With which the vales are leuelled, Till Cæsars taske were finished. Ditches he casts vp large and deepe: Then mantled Towers square and steepe, He reares vpon his trenches toppes; And in this sort he rounding stoppes A long fetch't compast monstrous bound, Of bushy woods, and forrest ground, With plowed lands, and pasture fields, And some that nought but briers yeelds: And in this vast incircled soyle The sauadge beasts he did entoyle. So as now Pompey's Army needs Nor fields, nor fodder for their steedes; So large a territories space, Did this Cæsarean trench embrace. And Pompey had sufficient change, From place to place his Tents to range. Through it faire riuers tooke their sourse, And in the seas did end their course. Cæsar surueyes this wondrous feate, And when he saw it was compleat: He and his troopes (with toyle opprest) Amidst the large fields tooke their rest. Now let vs heare those fables old, That of the Troians walles were told, Ascribed to the God-heads cares, Although but fram'd of brittle wares: And those great wonders that doe flye Of Babylonian walles so hye, That seem'd to front and threat the skye, Made by the Parthian turne againe, That flying doth his fight maintaine. But looke what spacious fields and lands, Are compast with fierce Tygris bands, Or swift Orontes doth embrace, From which the Kings of Easterne race Did at the first with suddaine might, The compasse of Cæsars trench.Small kingdomes share vnto their right. Euen so much ground with rapted close In broyles of warre fronted with foes, He quickly wal'd and finished; Yet those, and this all perished. Those hands mought with a little toyle, Ioyne Abidos to Sestus soyle. And with like heapes of earth haue made The Hellespont a land-way trade. And might that Istmos haue purloyn'd, That Pelops land to Greece hath ioyn'd. Or else haue made a way direct For ships to passe without reflect Through that long stretching Malean straine That shelues so farre into the maine. Or any part of all the earth, Haue changed from her proper birth Vnto some clime of better mood, Though Nature had the worke withstood. This martiall terrace frame of rage So furnisht, doth enclose the stage, VVhence factious strife, &amp; bloody streames, Shall ouer-flow so many Realmes, Heere the Thessalian slaughters wonne, And Lybick murdrous deeds mis-done. And heere now flames the ciuill brand, VVithin this compast plot of land. This worke, when first it was erected, Pompey neuer suspected this trench to be in hand, vntill it was finished. Of Pompey was no more suspected Then are the clashings of the waues That lowd against Pelorum raues, Hard by those people, that farre wide In midst of Trinacry reside. Or then the Britton Calidons Can heare the blustring motions That Thetis billowes when they rake Against the Kentish cliffes, do make. But he no sooner found it out, VVhat fields this vaste trench closd about, But straight his troopes he did conuay From Petra, where secure they lay: And them about those hilles disposd, That this maine Rampart had enclosd. And this he practisd to this end, Pompeys policy to weaken Cæsars forces. That Cæsar should of force extend His troopes, and weaken so his strength, Disperst to guard the trenches length. For so much quantity in ground This new-raisd Rampart did surround, As is Aricia's little wood, Distant from Rome, whereas there stood A sacred Altar eleuate, Vnto Diana consecrate. Or as the riuer Tybris falles Into the sea from Roman walles. If so it ran straight in a line, And did not crooked trending twine, But yet no Trumpets sound alarmes, Nor weapons marshalled to harmes. Although sometimes (their Armes to try) The wounding darts on both sides flye. These Captaines now are kept a part With greater cares from bloody Mart. For Pompeys campe found penury Of fodder for his Caualry: Want of fodder in Pompeys Campe for his horses.That daily galloping these fields, Which earst such store of herbage yeelds, Their horned hoofes so bare had beate, That grasse nor greene was there to eate. The lusty Coursers than waxt faint, When as their lease was thus attaint, And to another feed were brought, Where rackes with hay were fully fraught. But then they mourn'd and pin'd away, Chang'd from fresh grasse to dryed hay. And whilst their Riders spurre their sides, And in the rings their gallop guides, With trembling ioynts all suddenly They sinke downe right, and gasping lye, Till death their stretch't out limbes surprise, And so the lusty courser dies. Besides all this, there did ensue An aire, that such infection drew, By heauens distemper'd foggy sky, Wherein contagious heates did fry, That through the Campe a pest doth flye. Such banefull Stygian loathsome sents A plague in Pompeys campe Do rise from out the dampish vents Of Nesis hollow mouldy caues; And such like vapours breathing raues From forth Typhæus nasty denne, That chokes with stench both beasts &amp; men. Herewith in heapes the Souldiers fall, And that which plagues them worst of all, The poisned waters more offend Then all those dampes the aire doth send: For that their bowels so doth freate, And parch them with such inward heate, As that the skinne it scorching swarts, Their very eyes with swelling starts, Their faces flame with fiery hue, Cangranes and Calentures ensue. And thus tormented sundry wayes, Their heads for paine they cannot raise. This raging violent disease So forcibly doth still encrease, As that they do not life maintaine In languishing, and dye with paine; Sudden death in Pompey's Campe. But all as soone as sicknesse takes Without delay an end it makes: And in such troopes so fast they dye, That whilst the dead vnburied lye, With noysome stench amongst the life, This foule contagion growes more rife. For these poore soules haue not at all, Any dig'd graues, or funerall. But as they doe yeeld vp their last, Out of the Campe their corpes are cast. Yet (that w?? somwhat calm'd these wrackes) The open sea was at their backes, The sea a friend to Pompey's campe. And now and then from Northerne winde, They some refreshing blasts did finde. And so the forraigne stranger shores, Their Campe with victuals plenty stores. Meane while this dull infectious aire, Did nothing Cæsars campe impaire. For they enioyed at their willes The large faire fields, and lofty hilles; Nor yet their waters noysome were, But streaming sweetly, fresh and cleere. Penury and famine in Cæsars Army.Although another crosse they finde, For famine plagues them in her kinde. Wherewith they were as much distrest As if a siege did them inuest. The bladed corne the earth did beare, Was not yet growne vnto an eare, So as the Souldiers for their feasts, Were faine to share their food with beasts. Gnabbing vpon the bryar buddes, And gathering greene leaues in the woods. And therewithall such hearbes finde out, Whose qualities they well might doubt. For that vpon such roots they grew, The shift that Cæsars Souldiers make for victuals.As neuer earst they saw nor knew. And some of these vpon the fire, They boyle and fry with sharpe desire, And some they chew and swallow raw, Wherewith to fill the hungry maw: And many other things they eate, Vnknowne before to be mans meate. Yet these staru'd soules, besieg'd and dar'd Their foes, that with full dishes far'd. But when that Pompey did desire, To force a way with blood and fire Through this huge trench, wherby his bands Might range at large in all the lands. Pompey determines to ouerthrow Cæsars large trench.He would not take the darke of night, To cloke a base vnmanly fight. For whilst they both from Armes refrain'd, To steale on Cæsar he disdain'd. But breaches large he meanes to make, And thorough them his way to take. The Rampart he would lay full low, And her high Towers ouer-throw. The sword and slaughter must hew out The way, to bring this worke about. The part that did most fitly stand For Pompey now to take in hand, And of this trench the neerest side, Was one high turret dignifide With Scæuas name; obscur'd from view, Scœua's, or Minutius name. With trees that thicke about it grew. Thither did he addresse his Mart, And sets vpon this vast rampart. With sudden charge; but raisd no dust, Pompey's forces assault the trench. Whereby to giue the foe mistrust Forthwith such noise of Trumpets sounds Throughout the fields and aire rebounds, Such store of Ensign'd Ægles blazde, To hold the enemy amazde. Whereby the sword should not alone Claime all the honor as his owne. And now to show their courage braue, That valour would due glory haue, What place soeuer any tooke, He neuer afterwards forsooke, But did that ground with force maintaine, A bloody fight at the trench. Or clouds it with his body slaine. This fight so many liues confounds, That bodies wanted to take wounds. And darts that flie like showres of raine, Were spent, and cast away in vaine. Then wildfire streames, and flaming pitch, Flyes on the Rampar and the ditch, So as the turrets shake withall, And totter as they meant to fall. The rams, the engines, and the slings, Their battry now with fury dings, Whose often shockes did make such wrack, That tower and rampart gins to crack. Then Pompeys men withouten stop, Do mount vpon the trenches top. And there their Ægles do display, Who hoping they had wonne the day: Thinke now the world shall them obey. That which so many thousand hands, Nor yet all Cæsars armed bands, Could not from vtter conquest hold: One man of courage vncontrold, Scæua, one of Cæsars Captaines defends the trench.Did change the fortune of this day, And reft the victor of his pray. His foes still brauing in the face, With his owne armes made good the place. And still, not vanquished, nor slaine, Great Pompey's conquest doth restraine. And Scæua was this worthies name, Who formerly had purchast fame In Cæsars Campe; a priuate man, Where he this height of honour wanne. For valour all those to exceed, That Rhene and Rhodanus did breed. There was he made for bloody hand, Centurion of a Latium band. And of that order ware the weed, Prone to each doughty daring deede. But yet he skillesse was to chuse Iust times his courage stout to vse. For valour shewne in ciuill warres, Is vertue maim'd with vices skarres. When he at last beholds in sight, His mates retiring from the fight, Seeking out corners to recoile, In safety from this furious broyle. With manly voyce he gan to cry, Scæua's words to his flying companions.VVhither (base cowards) do you flye? In Cæsars Armes you were not train'd, VVith fearfull scornes to be distain'd. O wretched beasts, whom terror driues! VVithout fight will you loose your liues? VVhat shame is this that you so droope, To shift your selues from all the troope? And not to couet to be found Amongst the dead, with honors wound. Ought not your furies to bee such, Although no dutie did you tutch? Because the foe this choise hath made, To pierce through vs with his proud blade, This day shall not be faintly tride, Without bloud shed on Pompeys side. How much more happy should I die Were I but grac't with Cæsars eye. But though that Fortune so detracts, His testimony of my acts; Yet will I so shut vp my dayes, That Pompeys selfe shall giue me praise. Come, shew the signes of noble hearts, On your foes bosomes breake your darts; And that they may your vigor feele, Vpon their throats retort your steele. The clouds of dust so high are flowne, And this noyse through the aire so blowne, As that the verie dinne, and rage, Doth Cæsar silent eares engage. Deare mates we yet vnuanquisht stand, Cæsar will come with speedy hand; Whose powre this place will soone releeue, Before our foes vs death can giue. This onely word so stird their sprites, The name of Cesar and hope of his coming reuiueth his discouraged troopes. As trumpets sounds at first incites And cals men vnto Martiall fights. The dauntlesse valour of this man, They all admir'd; and then they ran With eger minds him to behold, The youths likewise with spirits bold, Stood fast to know, if possibly A man in such extremitie, Enuiron'd with so many foes, When as the place did him enclose, By vertue could his life retaine: And hold it safe in Deaths disdaine. He stand fasts at the Towers defence, Those that assaile he driues from thence. Then carkasses in heapes that lie, He trowles from off the turret hie. And bruiseth them with bodies fals, Scæua's toyle and valour in defence of the trench.That seeke to scale or mine the walles. Then he the ruin'd stones convarts To martiall vse in stead of darts; Huge timbers he ore-turnes, and frames, Wherewith the foe he killes and lames: And threats on them himselfe to cast, Then pitchy brands, with flaming blast. And those that on the walles would reare, He quels with Iron-pointed speare: And with his blade sheares off their wrists, On battlements that lay their fists. Their chines he cracks, &amp; breaks their bones With casting down huge weights of stones. And those whose Morions are but weake, Their sculs in sunder he doth breake. Others againe he burnes and scalles, With streaming shoures of wildefire balles: So as their cheekes, their haire and eyes, Rapt with the flames, lowd hissing fries. Now when the bodies that were slaine, Did rise and mount aboue the plaine: Off from the turrets top he leapes Vpon the corpes, that lay in heapes. And in the midst of them he stood, With threatning browes, and raging mood, As if a Leopard should skippe Out of the Hunters toyle to slippe: So he enclosd with trooping swarmes Engag'd, repelles all force of Armes: His looks with dread their courage charms His sword that like a razor cuts, The dryed blood now blunts and gluts, That it abated had the edge, And turned dull like to a wedge: So as when Scæua with it stroke, Where as it lights, the bones it broke; But drew nor blood, nor gashing wounded, The steele with hewing was confounded. On him the burthen of the fight Did lye, and many a dart did light. No hand in vaine against him bent, No Iauelins push vnlucky spent. Fortune now sees new warres in hand, The prowes of one doth all withstand. Cæsar in his C?mentaries doth admirably c?m?d this man, and saith. that in his shield there were 230 darts found sticking. The Target of this valiant Knight Did ring, with blowes that on it light: His hollow caske so crackt and brys'd, That it his browes and temples squis'd. And yet this while no mortall blow Had he receiued by his foe; Onely the darts were throwne so thicke, That in his bones the heads did sticke. O witlesse gulles! why do you spend Your shafts and darts thus to no end? These many shoots that you haue driuen, Not yet one deadly wound hath giuen. Your mighty slings you shold haue brought And so this one mans end haue wrought: Or hugie stones from off the wall, Whose weight on him you might let fall; Or else your battering Ramme, whose force Quickly from him would life diuorce. Or your Balista's you might proue, If force thereof could him remoue From off the entrance of this port, Where he doth so your force retort; And as a mighty Bul-warke stands For Cæsars side, and scornes your hands, And Pompey's force in idle wasts. But now those Armes away he casts That should protect his breast from foes, And in his shield no trust repose: His left arme doth therewith dispence For hauing liu'd by his defence, And naked doth expose his breast Vnto all harmes that him opprest. And in his body fixt he beares A wood of darts, of shafts, and speares. Then hee with fainting steppes seekes out Some one in all this hostile rout, Whom he might crush, and on him fall Like to a marine monstrous whale. And as the beasts of Libicke shore, And Affrickes Elephants do rore, Opprest with multitudes of speares, When from their bloudy backes they teares, And do shake off the pointed darts, Which in their rugged tough hide smarts. Whose hidden wounds not dangerous are, But pierce the flesh, and giue a skarre. Nor all those darts that hang so thicke, Nor all the shafts that doe them pricke, Can fix on them so deepe a wound, Scæua receiues a mortall wound.To lay them flat dead on the ground. But now behold with skilfull art, Farre off Gortinus thrylles his dart, And Scæua's head therewith he smot, And in his eye there stickes the shot. Yet not appal'd, when he did feele The blow, he brake the crooked steele; And from the wound the shaft did plucke, Whereto the tender eye fast stucke. Then on the ground he lets it fall, And spurnes the dart and eye withall. So doth the grisly Poland Beare, When he is wounded with the speare, And madded with the sticking steele, Which hee with pricking smart doth feele; Gnawes on the wound, and like rage spends Vpon the dart that him offends. But whilst he flying raues and kickes, Within his flanke the lance fast stickes. The rancor of this direfull shot His visage did most vgly blot: For all his face was swolne, and smear'd With clotted bloud, no shape appear'd. Herewith so lowd the foes did shout, The ioy that the enemies made for Scæua's wound.As if from heauen some storme burst out. More ioy in them could not be seene, If Cæsars selfe had wounded beene, Then they exprest; which did surmount At this mans hurt, of meane account. But he with haughty stedfastnesse, Hereof doth the offence suppresse Mildly in shew, and with a grace, As though in him wroth had no place. Forbeare deere Countrey-men, quoth he, Scæua's subtilty. And turne your weapons off from me: No more wounds now my death doth need, You haue already done the deed. These darts but pluck't out of my breast, Of bloud I shall be dispossest. O take me vp, and let me lye In Pompey's Campe before I dye. Doe not your Captaine so betray, To hold from him what I doe say. Scæua had rather Cæsar leaue, Then not an honest death receaue. Vnlucky Aulus credit gaue To those false words that he did raue; And to his sword he did not list, Which he held ready in his fist. And as he came for to disarme This Captaine; (not suspecting harme) Quite through the middle of his throte, Aulus slaine by Scæua. Scæua his pointed fauchion smote. Then he new courage takes againe As soone as he had Aulus slaine. And said, so let him be embru'd, That hopes that I am yet subdu'd. Let Pompey know that Scæua's sword Scæua's proud speech before his death. No other place will him affoord; Vntill his Ensignes he do yeeld To Cæsars will, and quit the field. Thinke you (base men) that euer I Like Pompey's Cowards meane to dye? Deaths loue giues me more powerfull lawes Then Pompey's, or the Senates cause. These threats no sooner from him flies, But that huge clouds of dust did rise; VVhereby they all did then descry That Cæsar with his troopes was nye. And he arriued in good time, For thereby he takes off the crime And foule disgrace from Pompey's part, That they deserued in this Mart. Else Scæua thou perhaps alone All Pompey's troopes hadst ouer-throwne: For with the ending of this fight Thy life likewise did take his flight. But whilst that any did withstand, The warres gaue vigor to thy hand. But lying now stretcht on the ground, Thine own friends swarme about thee round; And striue to whom the grace may fall To beare thee to thy funerall. And him withall they did adore, As if within his breast he bore Some heauenly gift, or power diuine, The honour done to Scæua after hee was slaine.That made his vertue liuely shine. Then all of them did straine and striue, Out of his limbes the darts to riue: VVhich to the Gods they consecrate, To memorize his noble fate. And with the Armes of Scæua's breast, The God of warre they did invest. But yet how blest had beene thy name, And thou obtain'd more glorious fame; If Spaniards fierce of thee a dread Had turn'd their backes, and from thee fled. Or the Cantabrian martiall wights, That brode short glaiues vse in their fights. Or those rough Tewtons brusky swart, That vse long slang-swords in their mart. This ciuill warre allowes no place For Trophies; nor affoords the grace Ioues Temple with thy spoyles to dight, Nor Triumphes showts for valours right. O thou vnhappy, that in vaine Didst Cæsar with such valour gaine! Pompey repulsed in this sort By Cæsars forces from the fort, Hauing at last withdrawne his troopes From out this Ramparts trenching coopes, No more was tyred therewithall, (But to the warre a fresh doth fall) Then wearied is the raging maine, Whom Easterne winde doth hoise &amp; straine; When as the waues their wroth wold wreake, The rockes resisting do them breake. Or when some huge cliffe side it beates, Although at first no part it freates; Yet doth the weltring waue at length Moulder it downe for all his strength. For now he hath discouered plaine A Castle, standing neere the maine, Which of this Rampart was a part, Pompey enlargeth his roome for his campe. Whither he turnes his speedy Mart: Which he by sea and land diuides, And it assail'd on either sides. Then all the quarters as he goes, With Cohorts arm'd, abrode he strowes; And doth at large dispose his Tents, Now freed from former noysome sents: This fresh aire much his campe contents. So Padus channell swelling hye Ouer his bankes with streames doth flye; And all the lower pasture fields Vnto her raging current yeelds; Who with her heapes of gathered waues, At last on all the Champian raues: And with her torrents doth explore New channels, neuer knowne before. Which likewise frontier lands confounds, From some Lords taking their due bounds: And vnto others giues againe More then they euer did retaine. Cæsar had scarce discouered out This plot that Pompey went about, But that a Beacon it bewrayes, That suddainly huge flames displaies. And therewithall the dust that flies A Bulwarke of Cæsars trench razed by Pompey.In scatter'd cloudes vp to the skies; Now laid againe, the aire was cleere: Then to his sight did plaine appeare This Ramparts turret raz'd and torne, He findes it ruin'd and forlorne, The cold signes of a hostile scorne. The place was voyd, no warre he meets, Whereat the more he frets and greets, That Pompey so should take his rest, As though that Cæsar were supprest. He therefore now his force prepares To runne into all mischiefes snares, But that he would their new ioyes quaile; And then he fiercely did assaile Torquatus, one of Pompey's Captaines, whom Cæsar sets on.The quarter where Torquatus lyes, Who Cæsars march as speedy spies, As is a ship with all sailes borne, Swift driuen in a Circean storme. Torquatus drawes his troopes withall Closely within the Ramparts wall; And to combine his small strength fast, Into a ring he did them cast. By this time Cæsars force drew nye, And ore the Ramparts fence they flye. Then Pompey all his troopes of Armes Calles from the hils, that come in swarmes, Whose Army couers all the lands, And now incloseth Cæsars bands. Those people that dwell in the fields, Where Ætnas mount such sparkling yeelds, Are not with greater feare possest When from Encelads boyling breast, Cæsars troopes engaged and put to flight.Out of the cauernes fuming hye, The fiery flints abrode doe flye: VVhose heapes of burning cinders cast, All ouer, strowes the Champian vast. Then Cæsars troopes that saw with feares The dust that Pompey's army reares. But blinde with clouds of trembling frght, Amaz'd betooke themselues to flight. And then amongst their foes they fall, So feare to ruine them doth hall; Here so much bloud might haue bene shed, As might of force haue Cæsar led Pompey withholds the rage of his souldiers against Cesars troopes which he had at an aduantage. To yeeld vnto a setled peace, And so from ciuill Armes to cease: But that milde Pompey now withstands The rage of his owne armed bands, And with his owne appeasing words, Holds backe his souldiers forward swords. O Rome how blest had bene thy fate, How free thy lawes had held their state, And how exempt from Tyrants mace Had Sylla bene in Pompeys place. Alas the greefe thereof doth smart, And still that greefe will grieue my heart. That Cæsar thou hast thus suruiu'd, And to this impious haight arriu'd. Because in fight thou chanst to finde, And meete a Soninlaw so kinde. O most accursed fatall teene, No Libicke slaughters then had beene, Nor Spaine had Mundas furie seene; Nor yet that corps with goare polluted, Nobler then Egypts king reputed; Had so on Pharus shoare bene slaine, Nor Nilus blusht with that blood staine, Nor on Marmaricks fandie plaine Had Iubas naked carkasse laine. Nor Scipios blood bene shed with these The Punicke spirits to appease. Nor sacred Cato in this strife So soone had left his blessed life. But this might well haue prou'd the day All Romane wracks to wipe away, And therewithall anticipate The dismall blacke Pharsalian fate. Cæsar thus crost by heauenly powers, Forsakes these Ramparts and these Towers, And with his totter'd troopes defeated Vnto Emathias fields retreated. Cæsar takes his way towards Thessaly after this Defeate.Now those that fauour'd Pompeys part, And all the leaders of his mart Do him perswade all that they may, His forces now to turne away, And not his father inlaw pursue, Seeing that he his presence flew; Pompeys Captains perswade him to returne into Italy after this defeate that he gaue Cæsar.But that he would with his braue hoast, Returne vnto his natiue coast, For since no foe did him withstand, He well might visite Latium land. But Pompey flat did that deny, And in these tearmes he doth reply. Pompeys answer in deniall thereof.I neuer will to Rome returne As Cæsar did, to make her mourne, Neuer shall she see me againe, But freed of a Martiall traine. I could haue staide in Latium than, when first these ciuill iarres began, Would I our Temples so betray To make of them the souldiers pray, Or in the Forum armes display. Nay rather then I would conuart To Italy this bloody Mart, I sooner would pursue a warre Vnder the freezing Northerne starre, Amongst the Scythes, or in that soyle Whose plants the Torrid Zoane doth broile. Shall I for one victorious day Now take from Rome her rest away? O Rome why fled I first so farre But to preserue thee free from warre; And rather then Ile change that minde Now to become to thee vnkinde, And draw this hatefull strife on thee, Let Cæsar take all Rome for me. So said, he then prepar'd his hoast To march vnto the Easterne coast. And through by wayes his army past, Pompey pursues Cæsar. Pearcing those desart forrests vast, That frontyer on Candauias sides, And in Thessalia he abides, The place that Fate for warre prouides. This land mount Ossa doth inclose On that side where Aurora showes The rising of the winters sunne, The description and scituation of Thessaly. When he his lowest course doth runne. But when the worlds eye lookes vp higher, The cold aire warming with his fier, Whilst clyming vp the loftie skies, His beames yet somewhat oblique flies. And as those beames the land enuades On that side Pelion casts his shades. But when amidst the heauens he drawes Chasing the raging Lyons iawes, And makes his solstice for those lands There woody Othrys bordring stands. Then Pyndus frounts those milder blasts That Zephirus on that side casts; And hastens on approaching night, With his high top shading the light. And they that in the vale are bred Where mount Olympus lifts his head, Those bitter blasts neuer offends That Boreas from his cauerne sends, Nor know they whether that the Beare Be all night glowing in the spheare. Whilome this vallie, that did lie In midst of all these mountaines hie Was fennish grounds, and moorish muds, Still ouerwhelm'd with standing fluds: And those vast lakes that drownd this plaine Ranne not through Tempe to the Maine; But in one pond stood alwayes still, And euer more did waters swill; Vntill that the Herculean wonder, With mightie straine did rent asunder The Ossan mount from Pelion hill, And then these waters did distill, Into Nereus brakish fields, And so to Thetis sonne it yeelds Emathias kingdome; where abounds, Pharsalos goodly champion grounds: But how much better had it beene A watry plash, then grassie greene: There now Philaces cittie stands, The chiefe Cities of Thessalie.That first sent ships to Ilium lands. There Ptelos and Dorion towne, Wailing the Muses wrathfull frowne. Trachin likewise is seated there, And Melibæa freed from feare By Hercules Artillery; The bitter price of periury. Larissa likewise of great power, And noble Argos here did tower. Where now the cultor shares the soyle And plough-men dayly care and toyle; Here stood (as fables olde relates) Echions Thebes with seauenfolde gates. Whereas Agaue banished The Bacchanals she worshipped, By Pentheus her kingly sonne, Him all inrag'd to death hath donne. Whose head though cast into the fire, Could not appease her franticke ire. This hugie lake that now had vent To let out all her waters pent, In many parts it selfe deuides, Then Æas with small current slides, The chiefe Riuers of Thessalie.But with cleare streame bends to the west, Till in Ionian seas she rest. Nor yet with stronger course then this Doth run the sire of Isidis, Whose maiden shape high Ioue restores, And her transports to Egypts shores. So Achelous thence doth passe, (O Cæneus that almost was Thy sonne in law) and then defiles With slimie waues Echinads Iles. With Euenos that bare the staines Of blood from Nessus wounded vaines. And with his current streameth on Through Meleagers Calydon. Then Sperchios that with greater speed, The waues Maliacan doth feed. And sweet Amphrisos that doth sweepe, With cristall streames and channell deepe The fields where Phœbus fed his sheepe. And still Anauros, whence doth rise Nor vapours that the clouds supplies, Nor airie dewes that moisture casts, Nor gentle breathes of windy blasts. All other riuers else beside, Into the maine that do not glide With their own strength and proper course Into Pæneus yeeld their source. Then stickle stream'd Æpidanus, With neuer swift Enipeus, Till she with other waters bed; Thence doth Asopos take her head; Phœnyx and Melas doe the same, A riuer in Thessaly that runnes ouerthwart another riuer without mingling. And Tytaresse that holds his name, And waues so firme, and from his springs A vertue takes, which neuer mings With other streame; but safe and sound A path hath on Peneus found, As if itran vpon dry ground. And as Fame sayes, this riuers head Is in the Stygian waters bred. And being mindfull of his fount, Doth hold it selfe in more account, Then with the common waues to mixe, But keepes the maiestie of Styxe. As soone as all these ponds were drain'd Which erst this tracke of land retain'd, The first inhabiting of Thessaly after the land was drained. Bebicius with his furrowing shares For tillage these fat fields prepare; And all the Lelegans then tride How they the plough thereon could guide. Thereto the ploughmen put their hands Of Dolop, and Aeolian lands. The Magnetes there their horses stoares And people knowne to Minyen oares. Here did the Centaure, birth of clowds, That in Pelethron darke dens shrowds, Ingendred of Ixions race Disperse themselues, for dwelling place. And thou Moniche didst wonne there That Pholoes rockes didst riue and teare. And Rhetus that on Ætnas top Those hugie trees didst wresting lop. Which Boreas with his boystrous blast Could hardly teare or ouercast. And Phole in this soile did rest, Where great Alcides was his guest. And wicked Nessus here resides That afterwards gain'd bloody sides. With Lernean shafts that Hercles guides. And thou O Chiron now growne old, Conuerted to a starre so cold, Thy strong Æmonian bow dost draw Against great Scorpios poysoned maw. So on this land in euery part Did shine the direfull seedes of Mart. Here first of all the goodly breeds Of the Thessalian fierie steedes, For vse of warre so prone and fit, Did rise, when as Neptunus smit The flintie stones with Marine mace, Engendring so the coarsers race, That champs the bit with praucing pace. And here the Lapiths hands first straines Their foaming mouths with bridling raines. Hence gallies cut the waues with oares, Sent from the Pagasæan shoares; And Inland men did first engage To venter on the billowes rage, And here Ionos that did raigne Ouer the vast Thessalian plaine, Coine framed Did first of all his stamps conioyne To molten mettals, fram'd for coyne. And maketh siluer run in streames, Swelting amidst the fiery gleames. The gold likewise at first he brake, The melting of Copper. And thereof money he did make, And in the boyling furnace vast, The copper he did liquid cast. Then thence did all that garboyle spring, And mischiefe that the warres did bring, Enticing all the world to armes For riches gaine, the seeds of harmes. Here was huge vgly Python bred, In Cyrrhan dens lurking his head. And then was vsde Thessalian bayes, To yeeld the Pythian games their praise. Wicked Alæus broode from hence Was sent, that made that high offence Against the Gods waging their warres, On Pelions top neare to the starres, Heaping mount Ossa on his backe, Whereby heauens course they thought to slack. Now when in these vnluckie lands, Both Chieftains had incampt their bands, The doubt of future warres euents, Their minds with equall cares torments. For now they see approaching nie, The day that must their fortunes trie. And as the houre did draw more neare, So coward minds the more did feare, And still the worst their thoughts retaine, But yet some few of these againe Giues to their courage better scope, By ballancing their feare with hope. He taxeth Sextus Pompeys eldest sonne. And Sextus now amongst this rowte Did shew himselfe a crauen lowte. As one that no way did inherit The glory of great Pompeys spirit. For he will take a Pirates trade, And will the Scycill seas inuade; Whereby those Triumphs he distaind That on the seas his father gain'd. But now his feares stirres vp his mind, To know how chances stood design'd: And growne impatient of delayes, Long'd to foreknow his future dayes. The Delos God he doth not heede, Nor yet consults with Pythias reede. Nor what Dodona sawes relates, That breeds the Akorne swynish cates Which groue from Ioues mouth soundeth fates. Nor yet the Augures skill he tries Of bowel'd beasts for sacrifise; Nor what the flying birds presage, Nor yet obserues the lightnings rage; Nor doth he search to vnderstand The knowledge of th' Assyrian land, By motions of the starres on hie, And how the planets qualefie; Sextus giuen to trust to sorcery.Or any hidden lawfull meanes, But he the hatefull secrets gleanes Of Magicks spels, and them doth proue So odious to the Gods aboue. And wofull murdrous altars dights To Dis, and the infernall sprights Whom he beleeues, and as deiected, The heauenly powres he nought suspected. And now this place where he resides His wicked humour more misguides, For many sorcerers, and witches, Dwell there, where now his tents he pitches. Whose foule illusions fraught with lies Doth modest pietie despise. And of their art this point is chiefe To vndertake things past beliefe. For Thessaly on her rocks breeds Many inchanting balefull weeds. And sensibly her very stones Those damned spels did seale with grones. And many charmes it eleuates, Thessaly much inclined to witchcraft. The heauenly powres it violates. And fell Medea from those fields Fetcht herbs, that Colchos neuer yeelds. Their wicked charmes were of such force, That they could wrest vnto remorse The Gods deafe eares, that hardned weare Gainst those that more deuotion beare. And nations that their hests did feare. Their damned voyce and hellish cries, Could force a way to pearce the skyes. And with their powrefull words incite The opinion of the force of Thessalian witches. The higher powres in heauens dispight. For that same supreme care diuine How heauenly orbes and spheares encline Is cast aside, when they haue sent Their charmes vnto the firmament. For though the Babylonian clime, And Memphis do retaine the prime, Of all such sages as can tell What deepe and hidden skill doth dwell Within the ancient magicks spell; Yet th' Thessalian witch can bend, Those powres their altars to entend. Their charming words are of such might That those hard hearts that nought delight In sports of loue, nor naturally Retaine thereof the quallity By their inchantments set on fier, Shall flame in feruent loues desier. Yea crabbed sires, forespent with age, They will infect with lusting rage. The opinion that ancient times held of the power of sorcery and witchcraft. Nor onely noysome potions vse, Nor onely do that lumpe enfuse Which on a young colts forhead breeds, That slimie humours swelling feeds: Before the louing damme do share It with her teeth, and make it bare. But with the charmes that they do chatter, Not vsing any poysnous matter, They will the strongest minds infest, And at their pleasure force and wrest. And those whom discord hath misled To leaue and loath their nuptiall bed They haue reclaim'd; and that great force Of beautie wanting kinde remorse, By meanes of Magicks twisted twine, To gentle loue they made encline. And things from natures course estrang'd The daies to lengthned nights they chang'd The firmament kept not his course, The spheares forbeare their rapted source; Their motions dully languishing, Whenas their charming spels they sing. And Iupiter himselfe did woonder, Wat made the Poles so slowly blunder. And why they did not turne more swift, Being vrged with their woonted drift. All things are ouerlaide with showrs, When Phœbus shines the dark clouds lowrs. Vnknowne to Ioue they make it thunder, As though the skies would rent in sunder. With one selfe voyce they cloudes disperse, And then againe to raine reuerse. When no wind blowes, the seas shall rage, And in huge stormes their wrath asswage. Here the Poet shewes the opinion that was held of the power of Thessalian sorcerers.And (most contrary vnto kinde) The ships shall saile against the winde. The torrent from the mountains top Amidst his course shall stay and stop. The riuer shall run countermount, And turne his course vnto his fount. The Sommer shall not Nylus raise, Meander straight his crooked wayes. The Rhodanus shall be come slow, And Arar him shall ouergo. The mountains whelme their steepy head, And as a plaine be ouerspread. Olympus vnderlooke the clouds: Scythia from whom the Sun still shrowds In midst of winters frostie flaw, Her snowes shall then dissolue and thaw; And with their charmes they will restraine The setled flowing of the maine. And force him with those bonds dispense Design'd by Cynthias influence. They will so strike that fixed waight The Axe, that bears the worlds whole fraight That turning in the Orbes mid wheele, It beckning somewhat seemes to reele. And with one word this heaped masse, And pondrous loade so crazed was, That it would prospects thorow teare, To see the other Hemispheare. All animals of deadly natures That Lethall beene to humane creatures, In feare of these inchanters liue, Or to their art assistance giue. The Tygre with his bloodie iawes; The Lyon that all ouer-awes, On them will fawne with milde aspect. The water Snakes with like respect, Their chilly circles will vnfould, And streatch themselues on dewy mould, If these vile hagges do them behold. The vipers wombe, when it is torne, By that damn'd broode that she hath borne, They will make whole; and humane breath Shall giue the Serpent present death. How are the Gods perplext with paine, To yeeld vnto this sorcerous vaine? A conceite of the Authors. And held in awe them to disdaine? What contract haue they made withall? That they can hold them so in thrall. Are they opprest by Witches might, Or in their charmes take they delight? Are they deare to the Deities, For any secret pieties. Do they preuaile this by entreates, Or do they vse some secret threates? With all the Gods haue they that hand: Or do those powerfull charmes command? Some one peculiar Deitie, That can with such facilitie Constraine this world to yeeld and tend To that which is so forc't to bend. These witches first did headlong teare The starres downe from the loftie spheare, And modest Cynthias siluer hue Vnto a pallid colour grew. Infected with their venom'd phrase, And with swarth earthly face did blaze. As if the earth had bene betweene To barre her of her brothers sheene. And that his orbe with duskie shade Those heauenly beames kept from her glade And with these charmes is so opprest That she can neuer be at rest, Vntill the slimie matter fall, That they do oint their hearbs withall. These wicked rites and charming spels Practisde whereas those vile hags dwels, Erycktho fierce seem'd to disdaine, Pretending her more pious vaine; A tedious description of a Thessalian witch called Ericktho.And into new formes would conuart The errors of this loathsome art. She would not lodge her damned head In towne, or house, or any shed. But still amongst the graues would rest, And tombes of corses dispossest. Gratefull to hellish Deities, Conuersing silent companies. Life vnto her no hinderance was, Into the Stygian shades to passe. And there the secret will to know Of Dis, that woonneth still below. Her bleasme and megre lookes detect, A loathsome hellish swarth aspect; That bright dayes light will neuer see, The Stygian shades her prospects bee. She hath withall a gastly face, And feltred lockes about it trace. When showres, or duskie clouds by night Obscure the starres from humane sight, Out of the silent graues she hasts, And catcheth at the lightning blasts. Then through the fields she pacing spurnes, And full-ear'd corne she blasting burnes: And with the very breath she sends, The healthy aire taints and offends. Vnto the Gods she neuer prayes, Nor powers of heauen to guide her wayes. She takes no keepe of Augures skill, How sacrifice bodes good or ill: But most of all she doth desire, The funerall piles to set on fire; And whilst they burne, to filch from thence The Spices and the Frankinsence. The Gods euen at the first request, Do grant to her each wicked hest: And feare to heare her twice to craue The thing that she desires to haue. She buries bodies yet aliue, Before that death their soules depriue: And though their date might long subsist, In spight of Fates she cuts their twist. And others dead brings backe againe From funerals, with ioyfull traine; Restoring life to euery vaine. Out of the midst of funerall fires She rapes, and greedily desires The smoking cinders as they lye, And yong mens bones that flaming fry. And raging, will not doubt nor feare The torch from parents hands to teare. Then all the flakes that she espies, Which from the coarse w?? black smoke flies, And garments vnto ashes turn'd, And oylie fragments scarcely burn'd, Together she doth scrape and glut; But when into a Tombe they put A sollid body, moist within, With marrow closd in hardned skinne, Then will she raue on all the parts; Into the eyes her fingers darts, And neuer digging leaues withall Till she teares out the very ball. Then from the dryed hands she rents And gnawes the pallid excrements: The knots her teeth in sunder share, Of ropes wherewith men strangled are. The hanging carkasses she fleeces, And then the gibbets breakes in peeces: The wether-beaten paunch she cast Out of the corpes, and then at last She lets the sunne thereon to sprout, And vn-sod marrow so takes out. Those that are hang'd in Iron chaines, Whose hands the rusty fetters straines From all the ioynts, whereof distilles The oylie moisture, that downe trilles In greasie filth, and swarthy gore, She gathers vp for poysons store. Whilst gnawing on the nerues she files, Fast by the teeth she hangs the whiles; And if that she by chance doe finde A carkasse on the ground vn-shrinde, Amongst the rauening beasts and fowle, There will this Sorceresse sitting scowle: But will not with a knife select The flesh, and parts she doth affect: But she will onely pry and watch, The morsels from Wolues iawes to snatch. From murder neuer stayes her hands, When as in need of blood she stands That freshly flowes from wounds at first, Such she findes out to quench her thirst. Nor will she stay her murdrous mood, When she would sacrifice life-blood: Or that some funerall rites require The trembling intrailes on the fire. The babes within the mothers wombe, With gashing wound she will vntombe Ere nature bring it forth to light; Her flaming Altars so to dight. And whensoeuer she needs most Some cruell sturdy humor'd ghost, Her slaughtring fist the soules prepares, No humane life she euer spares. From off the chinnes she rents and teares Of flowring youths the downy haires. And with left hand the lockes will shaue Of striplings, lingring to the graue. This Witch her owne kinne hath not spar'd, That death of her dire hand hath shar'd: But first she would them coll and kisse, And then the head from corpes dismisse. And when that death their iawes had fixt, She then would gnab her teeth betwixt, And so bite off the labbring tongue, That to the dry throat fast was clung: And with her cold lips then would babble Of whispring charmes full many a rabble. And then at last with some vile spell Would send their sprights to shades of hell. The fame that of this Witch did runne, Had made her knowne to Pompey's sonne, Who in the depth of silent night, Eryctho's fame reported to Sextus. When Tytan had conuaid his light Vnto the middle of that skye, That to our feet opposd doth lye; Abrode at that time Sextus traces Into the solitary places, Attended by a company Prepar'd, and true to villany: VVho ranging vp and downe the land, VVhere graues and Tombes did vse to stand, By chaunce a farre they spy'd this hagge, Close sitting by a rocky cragge, Neere to a path that straight doth guide The way vnto mount Æmus side: There she such charms did m?bling chatter, That no Magitians knew the matter: Nor yet the Gods of Magickes art, Of her strange spels knew any part: New fictions she did cunne by heart. And fearing that this bloudy warre VVould be transferred yet more farre, From Thessaly to other soyles, VVhereby the blood that these garboyles On either side would flowing yeeld, Should be depriu'd Pharsalias field VVhich she already had defil'd VVith spelles, and incantations vilde; Did what she could that might withstand To draw the warres from out this land. For now she hop't to glut her mood, VVith vse of flowing humane blood: And that in such a world of strife, She should haue deaths, and slaughters rife; That cinders of the Romans dead, Might in Emathia's field be spread, And bones of noble Peeres there slaine, VVhose ghosts she hop't should be her gain. This was her drift, this her desire, VVherewith her heart was set on fire; Proposing to her selfe the spoyle Of Pompey's part vpon his foyle. And with like rage to raue and rampe Vpon some wrackes of Cæsars campe. Then to this hagge, with words full milde, First spake great Pompey's worthlesse childe. Sextus words to Eryctho.O thou that art the greatest grace Of Sages of Æmonian race, That canst at large to men relate Their destiny and future fate: And hast the power to turne aside Euents of harmes that should betide: I thee beseech doe me that grace To let me know this doubtfull case. What is the scope and certaine end VVhereto this ciuill warre will tend. I am not least of Roman heires, That intrest haue in these affaires; Great Pompey is my noble sire, And I his sonne that must aspire Either to be the Lord of all, Or heire of his great funerall. My minde doth doubtfull dread retaine, And yet resolu'd I am againe To carry all with courage stout, Were I but sure what would fall out. Doe thou therefore resolue I pray The doubt of this vncertaine day, That we be not surpris'd vnwares, Nor blindly led to Fortunes snares. From higher powers extort the truth, Or on the Gods thou maist haue ruth; And all the Stygian ghosts below Vrge to thy power, the truth to show. Goe search Thessalian fields about, And also learne which of our rout Death is resolu'd to him to call, That in these ciuill warres must fall. This labour is of no base kinde, But worthy thy inspired minde: A worke of glory by thee donne, To know how so great Fate shall runne. This glorifide Thessalian Witch, To heare her fame, for ioy did itch, Eryctho's answere to Sextus. And thus reply'd; O noble youth, Didst thou desire to know the truth Of future chance, in lesser fate As thou requir'st I could relate, Although the Gods it disavow'd; For so much is to Art allow'd. For though the planets influence, Did call some one mans life from hence; Yet could we thereof make a stay, And so likewise can take away With speciall hearbes, his liuing houre, That all the starres vnited power Did vnto eldest yeares designe, And in the midst breake off his twine. But since the order of all things From one first chiefe beginning springs, And Fates do labour in this all, And thou of that a change wouldst call, Whereby one onely mortall stroke Might this worlds vniverse revoke. All our consorts must needs agree, That Fortune can do more then wee. But if it may suffise thy hope, Of one mans hap to know the scope, Tis easie certainly to doe, And many meanes do helpe thereto. The earth, the aire, the Chaos old, The fields with hearbes so manifold, The rockes of Rhodopeian land VVould sound that we should vnderstand. But since that daily there is store Of new slaine bodies with fresh gore, Tis easie for Emathia's field One head for our designes to yeeld; VVhose carkasse warme, and newly slaine, Doth yet a sound of voyce retaine: VVhose corpes not parched with the sunne, Nor warmth as yet from members runne: This Stygian ghost not yet will stutter, But to our eares will plaine words vtter. VVhen she had said, her sullen head She artificially ore-spread VVith doubled darknesse of the night, And with a foggy mist bedight; About the bodies slaine she pries, That in the fields vnburied lies. And with her lookes she did affray The rauening Wolues, and birds of pray, VVho from the bodies fled away. VVhilst that this hagge a carkasse prold, And search't the marrow deadly cold, Wherein the lungs and lights she found Quite starke, but free from any wound. Then for a voyce she seekes and pries, Within this body where it lies. Meane while there hung in question than The fate of many a slaughtred man, VVhom she againe from death would call; For had she try'd to take them all, That of both Armies there lay slaine, The warres she had supply'd againe, And silenced Erebus law; For could this powerfull monster draw From Stygian lake so great a crew, Their fighting alwayes would renew. Eryctho chuseth a slaine body to enchaunt. But now a body she hath got, That had no wound but in the throat. Him she elects, and him doth hooke VVith halter, and with Iron crooke, And through the rockes the ruthlesse hagge This miserable corpes did dragge, That life must take, and doth it trace VVhereas a hollow vaulted place Vnder a lofty cliffe doth rise, VVhere she (fell Witch) doth sacrifice. Here is a land not farre from hell, Erycthos place of habitation. VVhere lies a deepe obscured cell Sunke vnder ground, with cauernes vast, VVhose toppe with shades is ouer-cast; For bowes of trees so enter-lace, That they obscure and vaile this place, So as no where can mortall eye Discerne the Sunne, or glimpse of skye; But deadly darknesse, and long night In this sad Denne be-clouds all sight, And but by charmes hath neuer light. The foggy aire within this cell, More lothsome is then dampes of hell. And this swarth Region on all sides, Auernus from our world diuides. And hither the infernall King His ghosts doth neuer feare to bring: For though this witch of Thessaly The Fates by force can qualifie, Yet doubtfull is it whether she From this place into hell can see: Or whether personally this fend Vnto the Stygian shades discend. A smokie foule rag'd weed she weares With open face, and back-cast haires: The fillets that her lockes do trace, She doth with vipers inter-lace. And when she saw in how great feare Yong Pompey and his followers were, As men that horror did confound, Looking downe wistly to the ground. What now (quoth she) be of good cheare, Eryctho encourageth Pompey, and his men affrighted.Lay doubt aside, and do not feare, For now you shall forthwith perceaue A figure new true life receaue, Though dread do make your spirits weake, Yet may you heare him plainly speake. If I should shew you Stygian lakes, And helles bankes breathing fiery flakes, And that you may the Furies see Safely, safe-conduited by me. And Cerberus with curled breast, Shaking his hideous snaky crest, And Gyants huge, whose feter'd hands Behinde their backes, are tide in bands. VVhy stand you cowards in such frights, To looke vpon poore trembling sprights? Then she doth luke-warme blood convay Into the body as it lay, And with new wounds the same doth gash, And clotterd gore away doth wash. Then she together working mings All vncoth births that Nature brings. The froth of mad dogges iawes she takes, That feare to see fresh watry lakes. The Lynx his bowels laid thereon, A rabble of sorcerous drugges. With the Hyena's ioyntlesse bone. The marrow of a stagge new dead, That hath a serpent swallowed. And that same little fish whose force Can so with-hold the forward course Of any ship amidst the maine, When all her sailes the winde doth straine. A Dragons eyes therewith she prest, And that stone in the Ægles nest, That ratling sounds, and heate doth catch Amongst the egges that she doth hatch. Th' Arabian Serpent that makes wing The poys'nous Viper, whose sharpe sting The red-sea Cockle doth defend, Wherein the pretious pearle is pen'd. And therewithall the skinne new flead From the Cœrastæ but halfe dead; With those burnt ashes that arise Out of the Phœnix sacrifice. These venom'd heapes she workes &amp; frames, Distinguish't by their seuerall names. And leaues she addes repleate with spelles, And growing hearbes, wherewith she melles The spittle of her driueling iawes, And euery other poysons cause, Deuised by her sorcerous sawes. Then with a voyce that farre exceeds The strength of all hearbs that earth breeds, She calles and charmes the Gods of hell, And mutters first a confus'd spell Of varying sounds, that wistly larre, From humane language diffring farre. She hath the barking of a hound, And of a Wolfe the howling sound. Eryctho's sundry sorts of voyces. The hollow whooping of the Owle, The skryching of the blacke night fowle. The bellowing of the sauadge beast, With hissing of a Snake exprest. The hollow murmures of the waues, Beating against the cliffie caues; The whistling of the wooddy leaues, And thunders noise, the clouds that cleaues. So many sounds from one voyce flye, The rest her direfull charmes supply: And with her tongue she frames a spell, That pierc'd downe to the depth of hell. Ye Destinies, the Stygian scourge, Ericthos charme.That torments on offenders vrge. And thou Auernus gulfe profound, That swalowing canst whole worlds confound And thou that all this earth dost sway, Whose death the heauenly powers delay, That thereby thou for longer times Maist be reseru'd, to plague thy crimes. O Styx, and yee Elizian fields, That solace none to witches yeelds! And thou Persephon that dost loth, The heauens, and thy mother both. And Hecate our deerest frend That to my tongue dost cunning lend; Whereby commerce and vse I haue Of ghosts, and the infernall graue. Thou Porter of infernall gates, That dost on bowels share for cates VVith thy deuouring rauenous iawes; And you three sisters that forth drawes And cuts in two each liuing line, Of power to breake this worke of mine. And thou ô Ferry-man growne old, That hast so long those waues controld, Doe not these soules from me with-hold; But grant to me that I request, If my petition be exprest VVith wicked words sufficiently, And vowes repleat with villany: Or if I neuer yet did charme, But that with bloud and bowels warme I first of all did breake my fast, And bodies full to you haue cast. And if that I the braines haue dasht That were bloud-warme, &amp; then haue washt, And to your Altars, heads did giue Of infants, that might longer liue: Obserue my suit, that doth not craue A body smoldred in the graue, Or that in darknesse long hath beene, But one that late the light hath seene; And newly did his soule discharge, And scarce arriued at helles varge; Let him my charmes now entertaine, And he shall soone returne againe. Let this ghost of a Souldier late, Great Pompey's destiny relate To Pompey's sonne, if in your sight A ciuill warre deserue that right. When she her charming spell had sed, She raisd her frothy mouth and head: Wistly a while she did behold The ghost of that same carkasse cold, That stood in feare, and great amaze Vpon those liuelesse limbes to gaze; And did that lothsome pinfold hate. The ghost amazed, loath to enter into the carkasse againe. That was her prison but of late. She dreads into that breast to passe, That now so hack't and mangled was. And in those bowels to reside, Whose veins were cut with wounds so wide. Ah wretched Ghost whom deaths last stroke Could not exempt from lifes fraile yoke! Eryctho maruailes much, and frets, That Fates should vse these lingring lets. And in her wroth this dead corpes takes, And scourgeth it with liuing snakes. Then through the earth by that same glade She pries, which she with charms had made. And barking, to the sprights she speakes, Eryctho enraged, threatens the infernall powers. Which noise Erebus silence breakes. Tysiphone thou hatefull spright, And thou Megera, that setst light By my request, come tell me plaine, When this sad soule you did retaine With you in hell, did she not beare Your torments, and your scourgings there? By your true names I will you call, You Stygian hagges I will enthrall, And captiues hold in this worlds light, And follow you with all despight Through Graues, through Tombes, through Burials, And banish you from Funerals. And Hecate Il'e make thee knowne In perfect shape that is thine owne: Thou shalt no more thy selfe adorne With borrowed figure, so to scorne The Gods, with falshood and decait, When thou art cal'd on them to wait. Thy vile pale forme I will display, Helles lookes thou shalt not put away. And I (Proserpina) will tell, That vnder earths huge weight doth dwell, What feasts and iunketing you make, And what disports in loue you take; And how you set your whole delight In dalliance with the King of night: Which life of thine, if Ceres kend, Thou neuer more to her shouldst wend. To thee of wretches all most vile, As iudge of this, I'le send the while Bright Tytan, with his beames so fierce, That through the chinks of earth shal pierce, And all thy shiftings open lay, By suddaine sending in of day. Will you assent my will to do, Or shall I him compell thereto, Meaning Demogorgon.Vpon whose name I neuer call, But that the earth doth quake withall; He that with face vncouered, Dares looke vpon Gorgona's head; And with his whippes and fell aspect, Trembling Erinnis doth correct. And he that can farre better tell Then your owne selues the dens of hell. His mansion vnder you he takes, And he may sweare by Stygian lakes. Forthwith when she had vsd her charme The chill blood in this corps grew warme. The black wounds now more fleshly showes And through the veins the thin blood flowes Strengthning withall each outward part; The dead body begins to take life. The tender strings that feede the hart Vnder the cold breast gan to beate, As soone as they did feele the heate. The marrow that was dulled long, Taking fresh force was grown more strong New life was mingled death among: Then pulses all and artyres strike, The sinewes streach and motion seeke. But now the body neuer tries To streach his lims whereas it lies, With easie strength and by degrees; But suddenly rebounding flees From off the ground, and stands vpright With eyes wide open to the light, And yawning iawes that breathed rife, Yet in his face was no great life. But rather of a deadly hue, Stiffe wrinckled and a pallid blew. He stonisht was at this worlds wonder, His tyed tong no sound could blunder. His voyce and speech had but in taske, To answer what the witch did aske. Tell me quoth she what I require, Eryctho speaks to the carkasse And for it great shall be thy hire. If to the world we truths impart, The fame of our Æmonian art Will euer, after glory gaine, And our free sawes, as soothes remaine: In such a shrine thy lims shall lie, And in such wood thy corps shall frie. And will so charme thy funerall, Erycthos reward she promiseth the carkasse that takes life.As that the spels of Magicks call: Thy ghost shall neuer hire at all. And to thy selfe this boone bequeaue, For that thou didst new life receaue. That hearbs nor charms shall be of force, Thy long sleepe euer to diuorce, That death receiuest at my hand, None do those answers vnderstand That Oracles and Trypods tell, Who Fates requires from ghosts of hell Shall euer in assurance dwell: He valiantly to worke doth go, That dire deaths Oracle would know. I pray thee therefore do not spare To shew things names right as they are. Describe the places, and speake plaine That I true Fates may entertaine. To this withall she addes a spell, Whereby the ghost had power to tell What so of him she sought to know, Whilst his sad face teares ouerflow. The ghost replies to Erictho and makes his relation.Truly I had not time (quoth he) To marke the Fatall sisters three, How they their spinning twists did guide, I was cal'd from the riuer side, So secretly and in such hast, I could not know how all things past. But that which I did learne was doon Amongst the soules where I did woon, Fell discord and outragious strife, Amongst the Roman ghost was rife. So as their broyles and armed riet, Th' infernall state did much disquiet. Diuers great Captains were diuided, About their quarrell vndecided. One part doth in Elysium dwell, Tother in those darke dens of hell. And both sides readily inclin'd, To trie what destinie design'd. The blessed soules did then appeare, But sad and mournfull in their cheare. The Decij both I there beheld, The father and his worthie child. Braue spirits that did expiate The Tyranies from Roman state. Camillus, and the Curij, There wayling stood with watrie eye. And Scylla one amongst this rout, Against thee Fortune doth cry out. And Scipio there I saw deplore, That so the hatefull Affricke shore Their noble blood should now distaine, With his owne grandchild thereon slaine. And Cato maior of renowne, The ancient foe to Carthage towne, Did here lament his Nephewes fate, That dy'd in scorne of seruile state. And Brutus in his Consuls gowne, That Tyranny did first put downe, We here beheld in ioyful moode, Amongst blest soules whereas he stood. There Catilyne with prowd disdaines, Insults amongst his broken chaines. And Marius with his bloody harmes, Cethegi with their naked armes. There likewise I the Drusians saw, That made their libertie a law, Reioycing in a popular loue And Gracchi that great things durst proue, Though hampered with lasting chaines, Whose liberties hell-gates restraines. Yet clap their hands that plaudits yeelds These wicked ghosts craue blessed fields. Then this infernall Realmes great guide His stations did enlarge more wide. And therewithall he sharpes the rocks, Hard adamantine chaines and locks, With iron links he doth prepare, The ghost speakes to Sextus. As torments for the victors share. But yet ô youth take now with thee This comfortable word from me, Expect a blessed resting place For thy sires soule and all his race. For in that kingdome deepe of Dis A pleasant part reserued is To entertaine great Pompeys spright. Let not the glory him delight, Of this short lifes vncertaine date, The houre drawes neare, whose present fate, Shall these great captains fortunes mixe; In death therefore your comforts fixe. Go proudly and with high desires Vnto your lowly funerall fiers, And spurning scorne those haughty soules That Roman rites like Gods controules. For now the strife is who shall haue Pompey on the one of them: and Cæsar on the other.On Tybris or on Nyle his graue, And all the warre these Captaines wage Is where shall be their funerall stage. But as for what concernes thy fate, Do not desire I should relate, Spare me, for though I silence keepe A Prophet of more knowledge deepe, Will let thee all things vnderstand, And thou in the Sicilian land, Shalt haue it at thy fathers hand. Whose mind as yet I do not know, Whither he meanes that thou shalt go; Or from what place thou shouldst refraine, Or what vnluckie coasts disdaine. Or in which part of this worlds clime Thou shouldst abide and spend thy time. But haplesse ye, Europe forbeare, Affricke and Asia, likewise feare, Fortune your tombes will there diuide, Where earst triumphant you did ride. O wretched house! the world you yeelds, Nought safer then Pharsalias fields. Thus hauing his relation told, With mornefull lookes did silence hold. And death was his desired meede, But Magicks charmes thereto would neede, And hearbes to make the carkasse fall; For Fates could not againe recall The soule that once at large did rome, By lawes expir'd of Stygian doome. Then did Erictho frame withall Eryctho burnes the carkasse. A pile of wood for funerall, Thus to the fire the bodie went Which kindled, was laid downe and brent. Where when Erictho saw him lie, She left him in that place to die. And so along with Sextus went, To visite Pompey at his Tent. But now the mornings dawne drew neare, So that the dayes peepe did appeare. Therefore that they might secret passe To Pompey where he camped was, She did inchant the scowling night, With sable vailes to clowd the light. Finis Libri Sexti. The seuenth Booke. The Argvment. This doth great Pompeys dreame relate, And wailes withall hi haplesse Fate. His eager troopes would battell haue; Tully the same doth likewise craue With filed speech, to giue content, Pompey (though loath) yeelds his consent. Prodigious signes appeare in sight: Both Armies in point to fight. The Chieftains with couragious words, Inuite the souldiers to their swords. The battels ioyne, and Pompeys hoast Is ouerthrowne, his Campe is lost. To saue himselfe away he flies; Cæsar a victors Fortune tries, The spoyles he freely doth bestow Pharsalias field with blood doth flow. More slow then euer was his guise Tytan did from Aurora rise, And contrary to Natures will, Clymes heauily the Easterne hill. He neuer more vnwillingly Did driue his Teeme against the skie: And lasily hung dragging backe. Though fiercely rapt with sweeping racke; So prone he was to shew defect, Vnder Ecclips his bright aspect Doth labour now, and blacke clouds breeds, Not such as fed his flaming steeds. And all this was but to delay From Thessaly the light of day. But now Boötes with his cart, Drawes on darke night, the latest part Of woefull Pompeys happy life; Whom pleasing dreames so free from strife Did entertaine, and fained showes His troubled thoughts did interpose. It seemed in this dreaming fit, Pompeys dreame. That he with stately pompe did sit, In that Theatre he did frame At Rome, which carryed Pompeys name. Thither the Romane people thrung In multitudes, whose voices rung With ioyfull shouts vnto the starres, To see him safe return'd from warres. And more to shew how they reioyce, They clapt their h?ds with thundring noyce Euen such applauding shouts they raise, As they did in his youthfull daies; And with such fawning him beheld, As when he had Sertorious queld, That fugitiue, in armes so fierce; And when he did with conquest pierce The westermost Iberian pride, And did for it in triumph ride. Then being but a youthfull knight, Attired in a robe sun-bright, And in a lofty Charriot plac't, Whom with applause the Senate grac't. Now whether that this did portend Of all his happinesse the end, And as a last retraite of ioy Did but presage future annoy; Or that this sound reuealing sleepe That doth our thoughts in fancies steepe, Did with accustom'd ambages, Expresse his fate by contraries. All turn'd to Pompeys miseries. Or that Romes fortune did bequeaue To him this sight for her last leaue; Knowing that he should neuer more Set footing on his natiue shore. Ye that the Camping watches keepe, Do not breake off this pleasant sleepe, Let not the sound of trumpets charmes, Pierce through his eares with wars alarmes The next night she shall haue dire rest, And sad sights shall his soule inuest. On both sides armed hoasts shall meete, And raging warre each other greete. Whence then could souldiers free fr? care Such sound sleeps, and such sweet rest share O happy would that day haue beene If thy Rome so could thee haue seene. O Pompey would the Gods of heauen That one desired day had giuen Vnto thy country, and to thee, Of eithers fate assur'd to bee! Whereby you mutuallie might proue The latest fruits of your deare loue. The euent of warre is doubtfull.Thou Pompey to the warres didst wend, As though thy daies in Rome should end. And Rome, that knew her conscience cleare, (Tender of thee, to her vowes deare) Did neuer thinke that foule offence Had with the Fates hung in suspence, That Rome should not the fortune haue To giue her Pompeys bones their graue. For then would youths, and aged sires, Vnbidden boyes with selfe desires, Haue mingled howling plaints with teares, The Matrones with disheueled haires, And virgins would their brests haue torne; Euen as the people then did mourne, That Brutus that did put downe the tyranny of the Tarquins. When Brutus was laid in his vrne. And now although they feare the hand Of him, that doth the victor stand, Though Cæsars selfe should first relate The newes of Pompeys wretched fate, Yet would they not forbeare to mourne, Whilst Cæsar were in triumph borne; And that the incense burning were, And that to Ioue they Bayes did beare. O wretched Citizens that hate The plaints of your owne greeued Fate! Because all could not with one haile In full Theatre him bewaile. Now Hesprus wiih his dauning day Had banisht the nights lamps away, When in the Tents through all the rout A secret murmuring burst out, Where fate had drawne the world together The wretched people trooping thither To Pompeys tent, with furie driuen Pompeys army importune their Generall to ioyn battell with Cæsar. Would haue the signe of battell giuen; The most not like to see next euen. And with huge cries the houres they hast, Of their neare deaths that drew on fast. Such direfull sudden rage them bends, Headlong to runne vnto their ends. Pompey is slow and coward cal'd, And vnto Cæsar too much thral'd. And that he kingdome did affect, And would the world to him subiect. Who seeing now that he could draw So many nations to his law, Would still his glorious powre maintaine, And therefore did all peace disdaine. The Kings and Nations of the East, Complain'd the warre was turn'd to ieast; And so protracted to their wrong, Who from their homes were held so long. O heauenly powres such is your wills, When you designe ought to our ills! And all with vs shall go awry, The blame on our owne faults must lie. To mischiefe headlong run they all, For dismall fight they cry and call. In Pompeys campe Pharsalias fate, Is vow'd to trie this dire debate. Then Tullius that patron great Of Roman eloquence; must treate In all their names; he that of yore, In his long robe did Rome restore To setled peace; and to the law Brought dreadfull Catiline in awe. But then did he the warres detest. Onely with him was in request The Forum, and the Rostrum seate, Long silenced with martiall heate. His eloquence no grace doth adde Vnto a cause in it selfe badde. Ciceroes oration to Pompey for the giuing of battell to Cæsar.O Pompey, for her fauours great, At thy hands Fortune doth intreate, That thou to her thy trust commend. The nobles that thy Campe attend, And all these kings, thy constant friends, That to thy aide their forces lends, Do now beseech thee to agree That Cæsar may subdued be. Shall he solong haue meanes to finde A bloody warre with all mankinde? The nations that thy selfe hath wonne, And didst so quickly ouerrun, VVill Pompeys glory disauow, That is so slow in conquest now. VVhither is thy braue courage fled, Vngratefull dost thou stand in dread, That heauen hath thee abandoned? Or with the Gods dar'st thou not trust The Senate, and thy cause so iust? Thy Hoast their ensignes will display And giue the foe a bloudy day: Vnto thy glory 'twere a taint That thou shouldst vanquish by constraint: Since thou by vs appointed art The Chiefetaine, and for vs dost Mart. Let it bee lawfull for our Host To warre when we affect it most. Why dost thou so by force hold backe The whole worlds Armes fr? Cæsars wrack? The darts do brandle in their hands, And all the troopes impatient stands Whilst Ensignes do draw out the bands. Hast therefore now thy Armes to take, Hee vrgeth Pompey either to professe himselfe a tyrant, or giue way to the Senate. Lest thine owne Trumpets thee forsake. The Senate craues to know of thee Whether that they thy Souldiers bee: Or whether they do in this Mart As thy compeeres retaine their part. Sighing the Cheifetaine sorrow showes, Hee found the Gods became his foes, And Fate did his entents oppose. If such, quoth hee, bee your desires, And that this time rather requires Huge troopes, and many an armed band, Pompeys answere, and reasons to the c?trary. Then such a leader as will stand Vpon aduantage, when hee may, I neuer will your fates delay. Let all to ruin head-long goe, By Fortunes hand at one dire blow. And let this day the last light bee That most of vs shall euer see. But Rome I thee to witnesse call, That Pompey cannot do with all, The time to him appointed was Wherein all should to mischiefe passe. This war might well haue ben made good, Without a blow, or losse of bloud Cæsar might haue beene captiued, Without a battell hazarded, And wonted peace recouered. What wicked rage (ô yee most blinde) Makes you to be of this strange minde? That since you ciuill armes do beare, Is victory to you a feare, Except you rauing wound and teare? Our foes haue now but little scope, And are bereft all marine hope. We haue compel'd the hungry bands To eate the greene corne of the lands. And they haue often wisht withall, That they vpon our swords might fall. Rather then this to starue and wither, So we and they might fall together. That warre is neare brought to his last, And al' the difficulty past. When to auoyde a greater fright, New souldiers shall desire to fight. And with the spurre of valours showes, And kindled furie couet blowes, For feare of future worser harmes, The minds of many so much charmes. That to preuent what they suspect, All present hazards they neglect. But truly valiant is that man, That with a setled patience can, Approaching perils so resist, As to defer them at his list. Must I leaue such securitie To Fortunes mutabilitie? The whole worlds hap must we afford, Vnto the hazard of the sword? You rather I should hazard fight Then conquer foes by martiall slight, Fortune committed to my cares The gouernment of Romes affaires, And I deliuer to her charge The same againe with powre more large, Let her as well now play her part, And guard them safe in blinded Mart. For in this course all praise or blame Pompey for his part doth disclaime. O Cæsar! with the powers diuine Thy prayers more preuaile then mine. Fight when you please, and fall to Armes; But yet how many wicked harmes, How great and many peoples wrackes Will this next day bring on our backes? How many Kings will shed their blood? And how will Enipheus flood Her Chrystall streames pollute and staine With purple gore of Romans slaine? But first I wish the hostile lance Of bloudy warre, with deaths mischance, Might pierce this wretched head of mine, If that my fate might bring to fine These ruines, and with it divart All mischiefes from my Countries part. The conquest if we do obtaine, Cannot to Pompey's fame adde gaine. If victory for vs do stand By slaughter, and by bloudy hand, The peoples hearts it will agrise, And odiously my name misprise. Or if that Pompey loose the game, Pompey will be a wretched name. All miseries the conquer'd finde, But blame and mallice stil's assign'd Vnto the victor as his share, That acts the warres last wofull chare. So hauing said, he did giue way To Armes, and Souldiers raging sway: As doth a Pilot sore distrest VVith a strong tempest, blowne by west; That a multitude left to their owne will, are like a ship without a Pilot. Leauing the helme, and leauing Art, Doth to the storme all rule impart; VVhereby the ship doth heaue and set, Drawne with the fury of the fret. Now in confusion doth this Campe VVith fearefull tumults raue and rampe, The Souldiers feare.Their minds with horrid thoughts opprest, Vnconstant moods boyle in their breast. Many with pallid lookes bewray Of deaths approch the dismall day, And in their faces doe relate A count'nance suiting to their fate: And that the houre drew on with speed, When humane chance should be decreed. And in what tearms Romes state should stand, Must in this battaile now be scan'd. No man his perils deemes aright, But greater doubts doe them affright. For who is hee that sees the maine With surges swallow vp the plaine, The highest mountaines ouerflowne With billowes from the Ocean blowne, The skies and Phœbus blazing crowne Vnto the earth come tumbling downe, In such a publicke wracke each where Would of his priuate stand in feare? No man had leasure now to dread The harmes that hanged ore his head, Romes destiny, and Pompeys fall, Was it that did distract them all. Pompeys Soulers fit their Armes.Vnto their swords they put no trust, Except new ground and scour'd from rust; Their darts are sharpned at the end, With stronger strings their bowes they bend. Their quiuers also stored full With choycest shafts that they could cull. The rowels of the horse-mens spurre Enlarg'd, to make his courser sturre. If it were lawfull to compare Mans labours with the supreame care, So Mars did grinde his fauchion Vpon the rough Cycilian stone; When the Phlegrean Gyants fierce Did make attempt the skies to pierce, So Neptune his three-forked mace With fiery temper did enchase, And Pæan so new steel'd againe His shafts, when he had Python slaine. So Pallas furbusht vp her Targe VVith Gorgons head, and lockes at large. And so to chastise those reuolts, Vulcan then chang'd Ioues thunder-bolts. Nature did not that time refraine Many prodigious signes seemed to presage mis-fortune to Pompey. By many signes to shew most plaine The fearefull accidents at hand, The skies the armed troopes withstand, Marching to the Pharsalian land. The tearing clouds with thunder-claps The Souldiers on their faces raps; Contrary flames, and pillars bright Of scorching fire, did them affright. Typhons commixt with sparkling beames, Typhon a kinde of fiery Meteor. That did affect the water streames, Brake out withall; and lightning flashes Dazled their eyes with findging dashes; From off their helmes it strake the crests, And from the blades the hilts it wrests: It also melts the headed Pile, The sulfrie aire rusts murdring steele. The swarming bees in clustred flights, By heapes vpon their Ensignes lights; So as the Ensigne-bearers might Could not from ground raise them vpright, The weight thereof was growne so dead, It made them bow both backe and head. Their publique Standards in a swet, And Roman Ægles weeping wet, VVhilst forward to the field they set. The Bull brought for the sacrifice, VVith fury from the Altar flies; And running head-long, himselfe cast Into Emathias field at last. So as no offring could be found To expiate that lucklesse ground. But what malignant Deities, And Furies of impieties O Cæsar hast thou cal'd vpon? What power of Stygian Region? What wicked damn'd infernall sprights, That range about in gloomy nights, Hath stir'd thee vp, and whet thy rage This odious wicked warre to wage? But now this doubt againe doth rise, Whether that feare abus'd their eyes, Or that these monstrous visions seene, Of Gods the Reuelations beene: For many thought they did behold How Pindus to Olympus rold, And that mount Æmus that same houre A gaping velley did deuoure. And that throughout Pharsalia's ground Strange howlings did by night resound. That streames of bloud by Ossa's hill Did to Bœbeida's lake distill. That they beheld in darke shades vail'd, How men with force their foes assail'd. The day pale dimnesse ouer-whelmes, Darke shades likewise incloud their helmes, Their parents buried ghosts did rise, And fluttring doe accost their eyes: But this one comfort did remaine To ease them in perplexed paine, These prodigious signes did encourage those that were bloudy minded.That those who with a guilty minde, Did hope the wicked meanes to finde, Their aged fathers throats to cut, And in their brothers blood to glut; Reioyced at the monstrous sights That with such horror maz'd mens sprights: And hop't these suddaine furies rage, Did vnto them successe presage. But why should it seeme strange at all, That those for whom death now did call, Should changes feele as life growes slacke, And trembling fits of natures wracke? If to the minde of man be giuen Knowledge of future things to steeuen, The guest that wonnes in Tyrian Gades, The Roman that Armenia trades: And those that vnder any clime Of all the world liu'd at that time Did grieue, and yet wist no cause why, And tooke their griefes offensiuely; But little knew what they should lose At these Emathian fatall blowes. If old Records we credit may, Vpon Euganeo's hill they say, An Augure sitting neere those streames Where Aponus breath-reeking steames Do rise, and spread their springs abrode, And in Timavas flood vnlode, Where was Antenors first abode. Now comes (this Augure then did say) An Augure sitting on Mount Euganeo, foresaw the battell of Pharsalia, and that Cæsar should ouercome Pompey. A great and lamentable day, The mightest things of humane state, Are like forth-with to haue their date; Pompeys and Cæsars wicked Armes Will now rush on to ciuill harmes. But whether that the thunders rage, And Ioues dire darts did thus presage: Or that he gazing on the skies, The heauens discordant humor spies; Or that the sad duskt firmament Did note to him this daies euent By dimnesse of th' eclipsed sunne, That was with darknesse ouer-runne. Nature in this dayes forme exprest Such difference from all the rest, As that if men did vnderstand (As did this Augure) to haue scan'd And well obseru'd the nouell change Of heauenly signes, how they did range, Then all the world might plaine haue seene (As well as hee) Pharsalia's teene. O worthy wights by Fate reseru'd, Of all the world to be obseru'd, Whose destinies to bring to end The whole heauens leasure did intend! If after ages heare the same, And to our Nephewes come their fame; Or if to men of great estate Our labours care Time shall relate, So as their mindes it recreate; A pretty conceit of the Authors for those that shall read his booke.When as these ciuill warres they read, It will provoke both hope and dread, And draw such wishes from their thought As shall be lost, and profite nought. For reading, they will be distracted, As though these were not matters acted; But as if they were strifes depending, Whose Fates as yet had not their ending, And all that while wish from their heart The best successe to Pompeys part. As soone as Pompey's armed bands March't towards the Pharsalian lands, The shining Sunne-beames bright aspect Against their armours did reflect; So as the valleyes and the hilles The order of Pompeys ArmyAll round about with light it filles. They did not rashly take the field, The haplesse Army order held; Lentulus had the left wing.And Lentulus had for his part The ordring of the left wings Mart, And those two Legions therewithall That of the Campe was principall, The first and fourth they did them call. Domitius had the right wingAnd vnto thee Domitius stout, Was giuen in charge the right wings rout; All-be-it with vnlucky hand Thou for thy Countries cause didst stand. The middle battaile strong compact, Scipio had the middle.With thick rang'd troops that were extract Out of the Cilician hoast, That came with Scipio from that coast: Who heere held but a Souldiers place, Though Affrick after did him grace As chiefe Commander in the field, The mountaine Capadocians held, Their Cohorts rang'd in ordred rankes On Empheus riuers bankes; And with them all alongst that flood How the rest of Pompeys aids were bestowed. That Pontus large-rain'd horse-men stood: In most of all the drier lands The Kings and Tetrarchs Army stands; And with them all the Princely swarmes, And Tyrants with their troopes of Armes, That to the Romans homage ought, And now in Latiums quarrell fought. There likewise the Numidians meet, And those Cydonians sent from Creet; The Archers from Iturea prest, There mingled stood amongst the rest. And valiant Gaules were there to show Their mallice to their ancient foe. The Spaniards with their narrow shields, Did range their troopes amidst those fields. O Destiny now take away These Nations from the victors pray; And when great Pompey is laid low, Consume all triumphes at that blow! This day (as it fell out by chance) Cæsar his Ensignes did aduance, And left his station in the morne, Cæsar sending his Troopes in the morning to gather corn, discouers Pompeys Army marching in battaile. Ranging the coast to gather corne With all his troopes; when suddainly He saw the armed enemy Marching alongst the Champian plaine, As he would battaile entertaine. The time he now sees offred faire For which he had made many a praire; Whereby he might (at once for all) Vnto an end this quarrell call. He mourn'd these long delayes to bide Rauisht with loue of Regall pride: And ciuill warres began to hate, As too slow drawing to their date; Because he had this little time Beene held off from this bloudy crime. For now he plainly did descry The hazards of them both drew nye; And saw the ruine of their states Must be committed vnto Fates. His fury now did ready stand His conquering Armes to take in hand; He no whit faints, nor makes a doubt Which way the world would turne about: His daring minde told him no lesse, But that he should haue good successe. His Fate to dread affoords no scope, Nor Pompeys nourisht any hope. Feare laid aside, with manly words He stirres his troopes to trust their swords. Cæsars oration to his Souldiers before the battaile of Pharsalia.Braue Souldiers that the world do tame, The fortune of my rising fame, Behold that long-desired sight To yeeld you meanes to come to fight: For that day need you wish no more, With your owne Armes your fates explore, It now doth rest vpon your hands, In what tearmes Cæsars fortune stands. This is the day I call to minde That you to me your faiths combin'd; In trust whereof we Armes put on, And marched ouer Rubicon: In hope that by your martiall might We should obtaine our Triumphes right, With-held from vs with such despight. This is that day whose ended broyles Shall fully recompence your toyles; And shall againe your states restore, And you establish as before Free Citizens, by force of Mart This day shall witnesse whether part By Fates iust doome, had best pretence To take vp Armes for rights defence. This battaile now will him conclude As heynous most that is subdu'd. If for my sake you did desire To yeeld me right by sword and fire, Now valiantly performe the same, Let conquest free your Armes from blame. No martiall hand can guiltlesse goe, That shall be censur'd by the foe. 'Tis not my Priuate that I seeke, But all your liberties a like; And that you may dominion beare Ouer all Nations farre and neare: For I affect a private life, Free from tempestious cares and strife. And as a Burger of Romes Towne, Clad in a meane Plebeian gowne; I nothing will refuse to bee So your aduancements I may see, Rule all and raigne in scorne of me. Much bloud you shall not need to spend For that great hope that yee attend: The Grecian youths that vs oppose, Out of the Fencing-schooles they chose: And many from their fields of games, Slow wrastlers whom no Mart enflames; But such as neuer yet bore Armes, Mixt barbrously with diffring swarmes; Such as when troopes to fighting falles, And Trumpets sounds to battaile calles, Will be afraid of their owne cry; Few hands this ciuill warre will trye. The world will soone be rid of most Of all that rabble in their host: They will but pester and encumber Our Roman foes with ill-rang'd number. Pierce through these men that are vntrain'd, And kingdomes that such fame retain'd: And when your swords shal first them greet, Throw downe their glory at your feet; And by your valour make it plaine, That those that in his boasting vaine, Pompey before his Chariots lead, (As mighty Nations vanquished) So gloriously through streets of Rome, Do not deserue one Triumphes doome. Thinke you that any friendly loue To warres, did these Armenians moue? As though that they tooke any care Of Romes estate, or her well-fare; Or any those Barbarian Kings That to these warres their forces brings, Would now for Pompeys Latium good Be at the cost of too much blood? Oh no, they hate vs Romanes all, And chiefly those that made them thrall. Fortune, that neuer me deceau'd, To my friends hands hath me bequeau'd, To those with me that witnesse are Of many fights in Gallicke warre. What Souldiers sword doe I not know, What trembling dart can any throw, But whilst that through the aire it flew, I soone could tell whose arme it threw? So as since that I you behold Your Captaine that led you of old, And those braue Ensignes by you borne That neuer yet receiued skorne, Your manly lookes with courage fraught, Your threatning eyes that terror brought, The day is yours, and now me seemes With bloudy gore that riuers steemes; Their Kings vpon the earth are spurn'd, The Senators lye tost and turn'd: The leaders and the Souldiers slaine In slaughtred troopes vpon the plaine; But now I do my Fates delay Your armed hands with words to stay, Giue warres approch his owne full sway. My heart is ouer-ioy'd with hope, Neuer saw I like Fortunes scope So neere my reach; neuer before The Gods to me such bounties store Did seeme to giue, a little ground Cæsar doth promise himselfe victory. Doth vs from our great wishes bound: This battaile fought I am the man That onely by my fauour can Freely bestow the treasur'd gold That Kings and many people hold. O heauens, what planets influence, What starre this motion did commence, That now on this Pharsalian land So great a question should be scand! This day there is for me prepar'd Either great paines, or great reward. Thinke but on Cæsars tortur'd state, The chaines that shall him captiuate, His head vpon the Rostrum plac't, His members rack't, torne and defac't; And you your selues will finde like feasts, In pinfolds pent, slaughtred as beasts, Since he with whom we warres maintaine, A Captaine is of Sylla's traine: Therefore regard your owne estates, For me I will preuent such Fates By vertue of my dreadlesse hand, Cæsars resolution. That at their mercy skornes to stand: For he that this day shall not see Vs victors of our foes to be, Shall see this sword of mine diuorse My breathing spirit from my Corse. Yee Gods that from the heauens hye Vouchsafe to bend your carefull eye Vnto this base inferior soyle, Cæsars pious request to the Gods. To looke vpon the Roman toyle. Let him the victory obtaine That shall from cruelty refraine; And will not deeme it but offence, Except in pitty he dispence To take away the liues of those Whom he subdues, although his foes. Though Pompey in his cruell mood Did glut his sword with Roman blood, When he our troopes at vantage tooke, Pent vp within a narrow nooke, Who out of valor chose to dye Cæsars mercifull charge to his souldiers going to the battaile.Rather then from their station flye. But my braue youths I you intreate Shew no such rigor in your heate. Kill not a man that shunnes your eyes, Deeme him a Citizen that flies; But whilst their weapons they doe vse, Let not fond pittie you abuse: Nor be then mou'd vnto remorse, But flat resist your parents force; Yea on their faces turne your swords, Whom reuerent yeares gray hairs affoords: If any should his kinsman finde, And in his breast his sword hath shrin'd; Or else so deere a friend shall wound, To whom for fauours he stands bound, Whilst they against you shew their might, Account your selfe from guilt acquite, As free as if he were a foe, That you before did neuer know. And now throw downe your Trenches wall, And fill the ditches therewithall, Whereby imbattail'd as it stands, The Army may march with full bands, And runne not out at little coopes, Dispersed into petty troopes: Your owne pauillions do not spare, For to that Campe wee marching are From whence that Army doth discend, Whereof we soone shall make an end. Scarcely had Cæsar spoken all, Cæsars troopes sally disorderly out of their campe to the battaile.But each one to his charge did fall, And suddainly they all did Arme Throughout the campe, and took the larme. Downe went the Trench and Tents in haste, The troopes are not in order plac't. According to their Chiefetaines Art, To Fates they doe commit this Mart. But if they all had Cæsars bin, And such as did affect to win The Roman Empire as their owne, By martiall art and valour showne; They would not then haue headlong prest To fight a Battaile for their rest. When Pompey saw his foes draw out, Bending to him with all their rout, And that the warre would no delay, But that the Gods design'd this day. He stood amaz'd, his heart grew cold, The which in Armes mishap foretold, That feare should such a captaine thrall; Like dread did his whole host appall. Then he a loftie horse bestrides, And through his troops and cohorts rides, Pompeys orati? to his soldiers before the battaile. The day (quoth he) that your braue sprights Prest on to end all lingring fights, Is now at hand, therefore expose Your vtmost force against your foes. This is the vpshot now for all, One houre will vs together call. He that his countries cause respects, Or his deare houshold Gods affects; He that his children and his wife, And all deare pledges of his life, Doth seeke to haue and hold againe, Must with his sword the same obtaine. For all is now by God prouided In this one field to be decided. And we must hope, that haue the right, The heauenly powers for vs will fight; They so will guide our weapons fierce, That they shall Cæsars bowels pierce; It is their wills that with his blood, Romes sacred lawes should be made good. Had they design'd to Cæsars fate The world and all the Romane state, By Destinies and their decree, My elder yeares might shortned be. But since the Gods by their high doome, Both of the people and of Rome, Haue Pompey plac't as leader chiefe, Tis no signe of their wroth or griefe. All means that may bring victorie, We haue prouided seriously. And many a Prince and noble Lord, Our fortunes run with free accord. The ancient bands of martiall wights, With graue aduice on our part fights. And if vnto our later yeares, Fate had reseru'd those worthy peares, The Curij, and Camilli stout, The Decij that did make no doubt Freely to sacrifice their blood, Thereby to gaine their Countrie good, All these on our side would haue stood. The nations that are farhest East Vnto this seruice now are prest. And many cities of account, So as our forces do surmount All other armed troopes by farre, That euer yet attempted warre: The whole worlds strength at once we haue The souldiers and the leaders braue, That both the Tropicks do containe From Southerne pole to Northerne waine. We able are (our wings stretcht out) To close our enemies about. Few hands to conquer will suffise, Our troops will dant them with their cries. Cæsar with his bare feeble host To fight with vs can be but lost. Thinke that vpon Romes walls there stands, With dangling locks, and cast vp hands, The Roman Matrones in your sight, Calling on you brauely to fight. And thinke the Senate, those graue Peeres Vnfit for Mart through aged yeeres, Following our Campe, do at your feete Prostrate their siluer haires with greete. And that Romes selfe you do encounter, Fearing a Tyrant should surmount her. Thinke that the Romanes of these dayes, And those that future times shall raise, With one voyce altogether praise, In freedome to receiue their birth, And so returne vnto the earth. And after these so deare respects, If Pompey might mone your affects, He and his children, and his spouse Would at your feete cast selfe same vowes. If lawfull twere reserued free, The Empires sacred maiestie. And lest we conquer them in fight, Pompey is but a banisht wight. And but his father-inlawes base scorne, And to your shame a man forlorne. My elder yeares I now should hate, And longer loath to draw my date, To bring hoare haires to seruile state. The heauie words their captaine vsde Hath all their minds with rage enfusde The Romane valour it doth moue Rather a present death to proue, Then those suspects should true be found That in his speech he did propound. Then both the armies rusht together, With equall furie shew'd by either. Feare doth one side to courage straine, The others hope to rule and raigne, And now their hands do that destry Which no age can againe supply. Nor euer any humane paine, Will be of powre to raise againe. Although from armes they still refraine. A compassionate speech. For this one onely battell day, Will future Maurood much decay, And will those peoples births destroy That after worlds might else enioy. So as the noble Latine name Will be a by-word of defame, The Albane and Laurentine bowres, The Gabine, and the Veian towres, And Coram rotted all with rust, Will not be seene for ruines dust. The Country voide and desolate; So as the Senatorian state, Vnwillingly will their remaine, Longer then night shall them constraine. And that to do they oft repine, Though one of Numas lawes diuine, But tis not age that this hath done, Nor putrifaction ouerrun Such mighty frames, but ciuill broyle Hath laide such citties with the soyle. What is become of all the store Of humane races but of yore, That in the world were borne and bread? The townes are vnreplenished? The champian vninhabited? One citie now vs all containes, The fields manur'd by slaues in chaines. The mouldy howses neuer airde With their foundations vnrepaird, Do euerie minute mouldring fall: Whilst in them no man dwels at all. The Romane walls do not embrace The citizens of her owne race. The scum of euery nation There now takes vp his station. These slaughtring warres hath this affected; And now it needs not be suspected, He deplores the miserable estate of the Romane Empire.That Rome is able in long time, To act againe a ciuill crime. For these harmes thanke Pharsalias field, To it may bloody Cannas yeeld, And Allias calamities, Long kept in Latium memorie. Rome lesser harmes in Annals sets But willingly this day forgets. O griefe! the desolation, That comes by aires infection, That pestilent diseases breeds, That from dire famines rage proceeds: Or Townes with rapting fiers burning Or fearefull earthquakes ouerturning Whole cities, all such great decayes These men might well repaire and raise. Whom Fortune brought fr? euery quarter, In this fell warre to slay and martyr. And laid them prostate in this field That many yeares did breede and yeeld, Of souldiers and of captains braue, That in these armies so did raue, And by their wracks did shew withall, How great Rome was, when she did fall. For by how much her powre was spread Ouer huge nations vanquished, The faster her prosperitie Now ranne vnto calamitie. Her warres each yeare to her did giue Nations did that her store relieue. Tytan as he his chariot roles, The largenes of the Roman Empire. Thy Empire sees in either Poles. And of the East small deale remain'd That by thy conquest was not gain'd. So as the circuit of thy might, Was alwaies vnder day and night The wandring Planets in their rounds Did neuer passe the Empires bounds. But now Emathias dismall day, Her glorie did so prostrate lay, As that on wracke to ruine brought What many yeares had set aloft. For by that day to passe it came That Iudea dreaded not our name, Nor that the Dakes would giue consents To liue in Townes and leaue their tents. Nor that our Consuls guirded round, Should guide the plowshare on the ground To cut Sarmatian cities bound. Nor that we could due vengeance haue On Parthians as their scorns did craue. And that our libertie in dread Of ciuill Tyrannie is fled Beyond the Tygris and the Rheine, Without hope to returne againe: Although by vs so often sought With our liues blood to haue bin bought: A good denyed vs to gaine Which Scythes and Germans do retaine, But neuer more will turne her face To looke vpon the Romane Race. I would our state had neuer knowne That Augurie by vultures showne, When first with their sinister flight, Our wals foundation deepe was pight By Romulus, that did surround A dismall groue within their bound, But that Romes fate had bene held backe, Till after this Thessalian wracke. O Fortune needs I must complaine, How Brutes their valours lost in vaine! Why with such reuerence and such awe Haue we obseru'd our ancient law? And euermore, as new yeares came, Did stile them by the Consuls name? Ye Meads, and Arabes are blest, With all the nations of the East, That haue bene vsde perpetually Vnto the rule of Tyranny. For now mongst those of any age, That kings haue held in vassalage, Our destenie is to be last, And seruile shame our glory blast. There are no Gods to be obaid; The world is but by blind chance swaid: Tis false that men of Ioue haue said. Could he (from out the lofty skie) These slaughters see of Thessaly, And hold from them his thundring might, When he Pholoen so will smite? And Oeton scorch with lightning flame. And Rhodops groue, so free from blame? How doth he blast the stately pine? What must this worke be brought to fine By Cassius hand? and must he quell The Tyrants head that so doth swell? The starres denide to lend their shine Vnto Thyestes odious line: And Argos cittie reft of light, Beclowding it with sodaine night, And will the heau'ns daylight afford Vnto Thessalias bloody sword? Whereas so many brethren meete With blood that do each other greete, And children that their parents slay, No mortall harmes the Gods do way. Yet of reuenge, so much we hope, As heauen can to the earth giue scope. These ciuill warres shall Deifie New powres, like to the Gods on hie. These Images shal be set out This is spoken in derision of the Cæsars that were so Deified and called Diui. With blazing stars, that beames do sprout About their heads, and in their hands Ioues thunderbolts and flaming brands. And in the Temples Rome shall sweare By Cæsars ghost with sacred feare. Now whilst both armies face to face With speedy march shortned the space That sundred them from fatall blowes, And were so neare as each one knowes Which way his deadly pyle should straine, And what hand threatned bane againe, They saw that then was come the time That needs must act a monstrous crime. The sonnes against their fathers stands, Brothers confront with armed hands, No man that time his place would change And yet with all a faintnesse strange Did them surprise; which pittie made, Crassine the first man that charged at this battell.And cold blood did their hearts inuade So as the cohorts on both parts Forbeare to throw their ready darts. Crassine the Gods on thee bestow An end that may no ending know. Not such a death as all men trie But death that liuing still shall die. That with a lance from thy strayn'd arme Didst first begin this ciuill harme, And with the blood of Roman wound, Didst first distaine Pharsalian ground. O heady rage and murdrous minde, Who would haue thought a hand to finde So prone to bloud, or else so bold Whilst Cæsars selfe his hands did hold. Now with shrill noyse the aire doth ring, The Cornet her strain'd notes did sing, The Trumpets to the battell sounds, The clamorous cries confusde rebounds From earth vnto the vaulted skie, Whereas the clouds do neuer flie, Nor where the thunders do engender; And then these shouts th?selues do render Vnto the vales nere Tempes groues, And thence againe it fleeting roues With doubling ecchoes, that lowd raues From hollow vaults of Pelian caues, So as therewith mount Pindus grones, And trembling shooke Pangean stones, Oeteus hil doth houle likewise And so the furie of these cries Doth all about those quarters flie That their owne noyse them terrifie A multitude of darts are cast, And with them diuers wishes past, Some hope that they their foes shal wound Others wish they may fall to ground: And that no blood should soyle their hands All now on hap and hazard stands. Vncertaine Fortune leades the dance, The guiltie now are made by chance. Of those that fall, how great a part Are slaine with flying shafts and dart? Now must the ciuill hate be showne, But by the murdring sword alone. The Romane blood is onely shed, With their owne glayues embowelled. Pompey now his battalions flankes With thicke and double filed rankes. Poldron to poldron fast combin'd, And Targateeres vnto them ioyn'd. So as they scarse had roome the whiles To vse their hands or cast their piles. They fear'd they were so nearely prest, That their owne swords would them infest. But Cæsars Veterans withall Headlong on these thicke troopes do fall: And through this presse of armed foes, They hew a passage with their blowes. Eu'n where their habergions and maile, Most safely did their bodies vaile. For (notwithstanding those strong coaces) They pierc't their bowels and their throats. So as amongst these troops of armes, Each one pertaker is of harmes. One army doth sustaine the fight: The other doth expresse his might. The swords are cold on Pompeys part: But Cæsars steeme in bloody mart. Neither did Fortune long delay The ballance of these broiles to sway: But like a torrent reuell keepes, And multitudes in moments sweepes. But herewithall foorth Pompey brings, His troopes of horse streatcht out in wings: And plac't them on his battaile flankes, And after them dispersed ranks Of light-arm'd bands, to giue supply, Who on the foe with furie flie. And all his nations pressing hither, Their weapons mingled then together. And now the Roman blood is sought VVith fire, stones, darts, much scath is wrought, And through the spatious aire there flies The bullets that with motion fries. Then the Arabians, and the Meades, And Ithyrans their stout troops leades Vnto the fight with bended bowes, That to their shafts no leuell showes: But onely shoote vp to the skies, Which then with deaded force down flies: So as the head is seldome found To do great harme or make deepe wound. Of pyles the deadly blowes they feele, The aire is arched all with steele. The darts and shafts so thicke do haile, That on the feeld they draw nights vaile. Then Cæsar did begin to doubt His vantguard might be put to rout. Therefore to strength his front prouides Some cohorts from those oblique sides That were behind the ensignes plac't, And those he thither drew in hast. The Barbarians first put to flight by Cæsar.VVhere the Barbarian horsemen swayd, VVhom his vnlookt for troops assayd, His wings stood fast not disarayd, These men he quickly put to flight, Amazde they had forgot to fight. And cowards shame they nought regarded. No care was euer well awarded, Nor charge in any ciuill harmes Vnto Barbarian fearefull swarmes. No sooner did their palfries feele, VVithin their brests the sticking steele, But in a rage their riders flings, And with their feete their brains out dings. Then all the horse troops took their heeles. Squadrons of youths together wheeles, And from the foe they turne their heads, And their owne footmen ouertreads. The vantguard of the army in a rout. The slaughter now exceeded measure, Resistance was no more at leasure. The warre held now vnequall lots, One side was swords, the other throats. But Cæsars hoast was much too slight To slaughter all those troopes outright, That he subdude and put to flight. O would this goare that in thee lies (Pharsalia) might thy thirst suffise, That these Barbarian breasts haue shed, And no more streames of blood be spred! And that their bones (in heapes so stroad) Might be enough thy fields to loade. Or if that thy desire be more To glut thy selfe with Romane gore; O then spare these Barbarians, The Galates, and Syrians, The Gaules, and Capadocians, Th' Armenian, and Cicilian realmes, The Spaniards in the worlds extreames! For when these ciuill warres are dated, These shall be Romans then created. So now this little feare begunne Doth through all Pompeys army run. And now the Fates a course prouide, That Cæsar all may rule and guide. For now the fight was come at length To Pompeys greatest troope and strength, Where his maine battaile ranged stood. The former ranks (with mazed mood) About the fields were scattring scard, The maine battell resists awhile. But here awhile the warre went hard. And Cæsars fortune stood debard. The youths (that in this battell stands) Were no auxiliary bands, The kings to this assistance brought. The Roman hands and swords then fought. One finds his brother in this place, Another sees his fathers face. Here rage and furie now exceeds, Here Cæsar are thy hainous deeds. O let this pageant of the warre, Be from my mind estranged farre! Let it to darknes be design'd, No age shall in my Poeme find, Discourses of so wicked kind, To teach hereafter and to show What ciuill warre can ouerthrow. And rather let all teares be lost, And all complaints at so deare cost. Therefore ô Rome what did betide In this last conflict, I will hide: Cæsar, that thunderbolt of rage, That spur, that furie doth engage, Did heare about the cohorts ride, Lest any mischiefe of his side Should be to seeke or left vndone, Incensing those headlong to run To bold attempts, whose hote desiers The rage of warre already fiers. Their murdring fauchions then he eyde, Which of them most in blood was dide: Cæsar whets on his souldiers.And which of them but slightly baynd, And onely at the point distaind. What hand the sword did trembling trie: What darts or piles do faintly flie, And what were throwne couragiously: Who onely by compulsion fights: And who in slaughtring wars delights: Who did relent his bloody vaine, When he a Citizen saw slaine. Thus ouer all the field he flies, Where slaughterd bodies heaped lies, And many of his men he found, Whose streaming blood gusht from the wound When he himselfe would then assay With his owne hand the blood to stay. VVhich way soeuer that he went, He seem'd the likenesse to present Of sterne Bellona, that did shake Her bloody whip, that makes men quake. Or as if Mars were in the field, Arm'd with the strong Palladian shield, With boystrous batton in his hand, Vrging a fierce Bistonian band, Whereas the whirling Charrets stand. Here slaughters rise, and cruell fight, That dimmes their eyes like misty night. Here now are hear'd huge grones and cries, With sounds from clashing Arms that flies, As men fall on each others backes, Whilst faulchions, faulchions hews, &amp; hacks. And Cæsars selfe with his owne hands Supplies with swords and darts their bands: And bids them (as they deale their blowes) Strike at the faces of their foes. He faster then drew on his troopes, And stirres them vp that fainting droopes. And those that dragge he makes aduance, Pushing them forward with his lance. The common rout he biddes them spare, Why Cæsar would haue his Souldiers aime at the Senate. And shewes them where the Senate are. He knowes the Empires chiefest blood, And where her noblest members stood. Who vanquisht, Rome was then his owne, And her last freedome ouer-throwne. Then second rankes of Peeres he boords, Piercing their reuerent breasts with swords. The Lepidi fall in this place, And those of the Metellan race: The Coruins likewise taste the same, And the Torquati Kingly name. The leaders and the chiefe are slaine, Whilst Pompey yet did safe remaine. O Brutus (that thy head didst maske Alluding to the sword that after slue Cæsar. But with a meane Plebeian caske, And so wert to thy foes vnknowne) With what sword was thy valour showne? Thou glory of the Empires state, Chiefe hope of Senatorian fate, Last of that race that banish't Kings, Whose name throughout all ages rings; O do not here (with too great spright) Against thy foes expresse thy might: Doe not thereby thy end aduance Before the dire Philippian chance. In thy Thessalia thou must fall; Because that the fields of Philippi are in Thessaly.Here canst thou doe no good at all, Although thy sword for Cæsar wait, He is not yet come to his haight; Nor to that supreme humane pride That will all honour ouer-stride. Then will his noble death beseeme The Fates, that him so worthy deeme. O let him liue, and proudly raigne, And then by Brutus sword be slaine. Here now our Countries glory dies, Here in a heape confused lies The maine battaile lost.The old Patrician Roman gore, Mixt with Plebeian bloudy store; And yet amidst this butcherie Of Heroick Nobilitie, Domitius stout that death of thine Aboue the rest most cleare did shine; Whom fate did oft oppresse and tosse: For Fortune still did Pompey crosse, Where thou madst one, and still hadst losse. So often wert thou Cæsars pray; But now hast clos'd thy latest day With liberty preserued free, Which makes those many wounds to thee Pleasing, whereof thou now must dye, And no more Cæsars pardons try. Cæsar insulteth ouer Domitius at the poynt of death.But Cæsar chanc't that way to passe, Where he in gore blood wallowing was, And tauntingly vnto him spake; Domitius, thou that soughtst to take, My charge from me, and gouerne Gaule, Pompey thou canst not serue at all, Without thee this warre we shall trye. No more he said; Then to reply, His panting breast him life affoords, And thus pronounc't his dying words; Cæsar thou hast not yet the meed Domitius last words to Cæsar Of thy accursed wicked deed. Doubtfull as yet doth stand thy fate, And lesse in shew then Pompeys state. I one of Pompeys traine doe goe Freely vnto the shades below: And safely thither doe I wend; And yet (by that these warres haue end) I well may hope, when I am dead, Wracke shall befall thy wretched head; And vengeance due shall on thee light, And yeeld both me and Pompey right. So hauing said, did life resigne, And deaths darke hand clos'd vp his eyne. In vaine alas what should I shed Teares here vpon the thousands dead Of those, that from the worlds each part Did finde their ends in this dire Mart? Or why should I but single out Some priuate fates in this huge rout, Whose bowels pierc't with deadly wounds Their latest liuing dayes confounds? Or who on earth dead bodies spurnes? Or who their bloody swords poynts turnes Vpon their breast, that gasping lye To free their soules that lingring dye? Or who at one blow downe is cast? Or who with hewd limbes standeth fast? Or who with darts doth bodies wound? Or with his launce nailes men to ground? Or whose veins pierc't whence blood flies out Into the aire, and doth besprout The Armour of his murdring foe? Who slaies his brother at a blow, And, as a stranger, doth him spoyle, Cuts off his head, and in the soyle Doth hide the same to hide his guilt; Or who his fathers bloud hath spilt: And mangled hath his face the while, The lookers on so to beguile: And doth it with such ragefull ire As twere some foe, and not his sire. No one mans death can claime lament; To waile men now no time is lent. The slaughters of Pharsalias field Is nothing such as others yeeld. There priuate Fates the warres attends: Here Rome and all her people ends. There warre to death doth souldiers call; But here at once whole Nations fall. The Grecian peoples bloud here streames, The Ponticke and Assirian realmes: And now the bloud of Romans slaine, In torrents fleets on that againe; And with her ouer-flowing store Sweepes from the fields Barbarian gore. More people in this battaile slaine Then our age can supply againe. Tis more then life and health that's lost; It hath the whole world ruine cost. The sword vpon those bodies rages, That should haue serued future ages. What haue our children yet misdonne, That they to seruile state must runne? Or what fault in posterity, Borne to be thralles to tyranny? Haue we so cowardly borne Armes, And offred vp our throats to harmes? The burthen of anothers feare, Vpon our shoulders must we beare? O Fortune! if thou needs wouldst call Our sonnes to be a tyrants thrall, Thou shouldst haue giuen them warres withall, Now doth vnhappy Pompey finde The Gods, and Roman Fates vnkinde: And (ere the fight was throughly ended) His cursed fortune he condemned. Whilst in the field hee stood on hye Vpon a hill, and thence did eye The slaughters and the troopes ramuerst Throughout Pharsalias field disperst. The which the fight before did hide, He multitudes sees on his side Of weapons, and of bodies lost, And his owne wracke, at their blouds cost; Yet did he not (as wretches will) Desire the whole with him should spill. Nor in his ruine wrap them all, But on the heauenly powers did call, That yet the greatest part might thriue Of Latium blood, and him suruiue: This is his comfort in annoy. O Gods (quoth he) doe not destroy So many Nations at a clappe: Pompeys praier to the Gods. The world may stand free from mishappe, And Rome may many ages flourish, Although that Pompey sinke and perish. But if it so your likings please, More woes on me to heape then these; My wife and children yet subsist For Fates to do with what they list. Hath not this ciuill warre cost deere, If I and mine must perish heere? May not such wounds be deemed wide, Though all the world escape beside? O Fortune! why dost thou so racke And labour to bring all to wracke? Nothing is mine, I all things lacke. So hauing said, he rides about The Ensignes, and the Armes in rout. And in each part throughout the lands Sees how his squadrons broken stands: Whom he retraits, and doth restraine From running to their deaths amaine. He values not himselfe so much, That for his sake harme should them touch. And yet his courage did not faile The swords and weapons to assaile, Or put his life to hazards chance, Or vnto death his breast aduance. He fear'd if Pompey there should dye, The Souldiers would no dangers flye, But on his body heaped lye. Besides, he fouly did despise To lye a scorne to Cæsars eyes. Yet if thy father-in-law affect To cast his eyes on that prospect, Thy head to him will be presented, It cannot be by place preuented: And thou his wife wert partly cause Why from this slaughter he with-drawes To see thy face; for Fates ordaine That in thy sight he should be slaine. Pompeys flight.Then he a Courser swift bestrides, And posting from the battaile rides. Feare makes him not to turne his backe, His heart did neuer courage lacke: In most distresse his minde was stout, Nor plaints nor teares he powreth out; But such a reuerent griefe exprest As with a Maiesty fits best For him, at that time to bestow On Roman fortune brought so low: And with like constancy beheld The downe-falles of Emathia's field. Nor prosperous wars could make thee proud Nor ouer-throwes thy courage cloud, That faithlesse Fortune (flattring thee With glorious pompe in triumphes three) Thou now dost scorne with lesse account, And makes thy minde her force surmount. Securely thou from hence dost part, Freed from the cumbrous cares of Mart. And now at large thou leasure hast To ruminate thy glories past. Ambitious hopes (neuer suffis'd) From thee are fled, and now despis'd Now maist thou ken thy fortunes scope; Fly warres, and in the Gods haue hope. None now (that Armes doe vndertake) Will spend their liues for Pompeys sake. Whether it be of Affricke soyle The lamentable bloody broyle, Or Munda's battaile stain'd with gore, Or slaughters on Ægyptian shore, Yet after thee there will remaine A great part of Thessalian traine. And Pompey will not haue his name So popular with worldly fame, As for thy sake like warres to wage. But from hence forth (in euery age) The faction of the warre will be Twixt Cæsars state and libertie: And though that thou the warres dost flee, The Senate to the death will fight To hold their owne and freedomes right. Canst thou in this finde no reliefe, That thus repulst thou shunst the griefe To see the slaughtred heapes that lye? Looke backe againe, and cast thine eye Vpon the riuers crimson staine, Clotted with gore of bodies slaine: Be-pitty then proud Cæsars vaine. Thinke what remorse will straine his breast When he shall enter Rome; opprest With griefe, for her deare people lost, Gain'd to Pharsalia at her cost: When thou therefore thy selfe shalt see Banisht in forraigne Realmes to bee, What euer fortunes thou shalt finde, Endure it with a manly minde: And whatsoeuer misery (Vnder the Pharian tyranny) Shall thee befall, with patience dure: And in the Gods thy hopes assure. They are more vnhappy that offer an iniury, albeit with successe: then those that repell an iniury, although with losse of their blood.And as the Fates affoord their grace, Beare with the changes of times space. The conquest would haue harm'd the more: Do not therefore thy hap deplore. Forbid the people to lament; All teares and lamentations stent. The world will Pompey as much good In his low ebbe, as in his flood. O doe not now (with lookes deiected) Behold those Kings thou hast subiected: Suruey the Citties wonne by thee, And kingdomes that thou gau'st in fee. Ægypt and Lybia thou maist trye; Chuse out the land where thou wouldst dye. Larissas Citty was the place, That first beheld thy noble face, After this foyle by Fortunes scorne: Yet saw thee not as one forlorne; The Larissans loue to Pompey.Her Citizens and chiefe estates With all their force passe through their gates To meet thee, as thy loyall frends, And wayling many presents sends: Their houses and their Temples vast They did set open as he past: And wish't that they had partners beene With him, in all his bloody teene. So as a great deale yet remain'd Of that great name he earst retain'd. Though lesse now then thy selfe alone, Thy power may once againe be showne: And Nations with thee led from farre, So to restore thy state by warre. But oh! (quoth he) what should a man Whom Fates from victory do ban, The aid of men or Townes receaue? Vnto the Conquerour bequeaue Your faiths, and to his fauours cleaue. But Cæsar thou dost ouer-stride, And march as yet on euery side Vpon the bowels and the breasts, As they in heaped slaughters rests Of thine owne Countries wofull fall; Thy son-in-law now quits thee all. Away the Courser Pompey beares, Follow'd with many sighes and teares; And on the cruell Destinies The people powre out cursed cries. Now Pompey dost thou truly finde The faith that thy deserts did binde: For now the fruits thereof they show, Prosperity no loue can know. When Cæsar saw of Latium gore The fields did flote with ample store; He bids them now forbeare their swords, And to poore soules he grace affoords: For all was subiect to their hands; Twas vaine to kill those hope-lost bands That for their liues at mercy stands. But lest the standing Campe might be A safe retrait to those that flee; And to enioy the quiet night VVithout alarmes, or new affright; He meant to vndertake the venter On Pompeys Campe, and it to enter Cæsar entreth Pompeys campe VVhilst fortune now was hot in blood, And all in maze and terror stood; Not doubting but his men were prest, Herein to yeeld vnto his hest, Although that they were all growne faint VVith long fight, and with heate attaint. But souldiers small perswasions need To lead them to receiue their meed: Or to prepare them to a pray; Yet Cæsar thus to them did say: Souldiers (quoth he) your valiant proes Hath wonne full conquest on your foes: And for the blood drawne from your vains, Rewards and Honors now remaines. VVhich to performe, I hold my part, Yet that which due is to desart I will not tearme a gift to bee: Each one shall giue himselfe his fee. Behold the Tents before your eyes, Where gold and siluer heaped lies; Here is lockt vp (in many a Chest) The treasure taken from the west; The pretious Easterne Implements Doth stuffe and cloy their glorious Tents: The Fortunes that are gotten hither Of Pompey, and of Kings together, Doe but attend to be a pray Vnto the victor; haste your way To come before them to the place, Whom now you following haue in chase. He said no more, but their desire Whom greedy gaine had set on fire, Did head-long driue them without feare, Thorow the swords their way to teare; And on their fathers bones to tread, Spurning the Captaines that lay dead. What Ditch or Rampart could suffise To hold them out whom such a prize And booty of the warre inuites? They now wold know to ease their sprights The gaines of all their bloody fights. And here lay lodg'd (to maintain mart) Many great treasures set a part, Heap't vp together in a whoord, Spoyles that the whole world did affoord. Yet for all this, they could not finde Sufficient to content their minde. What gold is found in Ibers sands, All the rich spoyles that Cæsars Souldiers found in Pompeys camp could not content their greedy minds.Or Tagus casts vpon her strands: Or all those heapes of pretious graines Dig'd out of Arimaspus vaines, Is made their spoyle, and yet they thought It not enough, but deerely bought. For now their conquering hopes deuoures The spoyle of the Tarpeian Towers, And promise to themselues a day That Rome and all shall be their pray. But yet therein they are deceiu'd, The Tents are to their spoyle bequeau'd. The wicked souldiers, and base Slowches Do sleepe on the Patrician Couches. The Kings pauillions, and their beds Are roomes for slaues to lay their heads. Their brothers Cabins some invested, Some where their fathers lately rested Their slaughtring bloody members nested And those whom rauing slumbers haunts, And frightfull dreames in sleeping daunts, Doe tosse in their afflicted sprights The cruell late Pharsalian fights: Their bloody facts possesse their eyes, The rage of Armes their mindes agrise: And without swords about them goes Their hands, as they were dealing blowes. A man would thinke the very fields And balefull lands, those visions yeelds: And that some apparitions strange Of ghosts, that putred aire did range: And that by night the fearfull shapes Of Stygian sprights their sences rapes. This victory with heauy straines Requites the victors worthlesse paines. Terrible dreames affright Cæsars souldiers in their sleepe. Hissing of Serpents in their dreames, And firie flames cast forth huge streames: Slaine Citizens to them appeare, And each one hath his priuate feare. One sees in sleepe an old mans face, And other lusty youths in place: One doth his brothers corps behould Pale and dis-figured on the mould; Another in his dreame discernes His fathers wounds, whereat he yearnes. And all these sprights, and hellish feares Then Cæsars guilty conscience teares No lesse then did those hagges of hell Within Orestes spirits dwell, That with affrights his visage vrg'd, Till Scythian Altars him had purg'd. Nor yet Pentheius in his minde More furious gastly fits did finde; Nor mad Agaue in her kinde. Cæsars feareful apparitions in his dreames.For all the swords that bloud did staine, Now shed on the Pharsalian plaine; And those reuenging swords withall, That should in future on him fall By force of Senatorian spight, In dreames oppressed him this night; So doe the furies him affright. How liues this wretched man in feare That doth such guilt in conscience beare, That in his dreames he seemes to see The Stygian ghosts about him flee, With all the foule infernall traines Whilst Pompey still aliue remaines? Yet this no whit his conscience straines. But when cleare day (with shining beames) Bewraid Pharsalia's bloody streames, The horror of that vgly sight Did not his gasping eyes affright, Nor turne them from those lothsome lands, But lookes how thicke the riuers stands Clotted with gore, and how likewise As high as hilles the bodies rise, That on the Champian heaped lies. Of Pompeys men a tale he takes, And in that place a feast he makes. He pries amongst the bodies there, What faces knowne vnto him were; And herein great contentment found. He could not see Emathias ground, Nor cast his eyes vpon the plaine, Hid with the bodies that lay slaine. There saw he how his fortune stood, And all his Gods clothed in blood. An inuectiue against Cæsar for not allowing Pompeys slaine souldiers a funerall fire. And for because he would not lose This pleasing prospect on dead foes, Still madding in his wicked ire, He would not giue them funerall fire. But let them rotting there to rest, Emathias aire so to infest. Hanniball buried Marcellus his enemy with great magnificence. He might haue learn'd by Hanniball, That gaue our Consull funerall: And how he humane rites bestowes, (In Cannas fields) vpon his foes. With pyles of wood to burne the dead, Which Lybicke torches kindled. But that sterne wroth that him enrag'd The slaughter had not yet asswag'd. For he remembred in his minde The Romans were to him vnkinde, But now we do not here desire For euery one a single sire: Or any glorious funerall: Bestow but one fire on them all. We do not seeke that they should burne In parted flames and shared vrne. Or if thou Pompey more wouldst spite, All Pindus woods then hew downe quite, And the Oetean oakes lay wast, And make of all one pile so vast, That he may from the seas descrie Pharsalian flames streame in the skie. This rage of thine auaileth nought, By whatsoeuer meanes tis wrought, That these dead bodies may consume: For be it with a fierie fume, Or else with time that they do rot, And turne to dust it skilleth not. For nature (in her louing wombe) Doth freely mortals all intombe. All bodies that do breath and liue, Their end to her as debt must giue. And though that Cæsar, in disdaine, Their funerall fire from them detaine; Yet when the Earth and Ocean vast Shall be consum'd with flames at last, One common fire the world shall haue, And starres with humane bones engraue. And vnto whatsoeuer place Fortune thy flitting soule shall chase; These soules the selfe-same way shall wend: No higher shall thy ghost ascend, But lodge in Stygian shade below; No better mansion shalt thou know. Lucans opinion of the last dissolution of the world. From Fortunes freakes death frees vs all, What earth doth yeeld, earth doth recall; And he that lies vnburied, With heauens high cope is couered. And thou that dost whole nations wrong From burials, that to them belong; Why dost thou loth these slaughtred bands, And shunne these soild contagious lands? Cæsar doe thou these waters drinke, In this aire breath that so doth stinke. But these corrupted bodies slaine Doe take from thee Pharsalia plaine: And in despight do hold the place, And thence the conquerours do chase. But to this carnage for their food Thither repaires with rauening mood The Thracian wolues, that vent from farre The bloud of this Æmonian warre: The Lyons come from Pholoen, And doe forsake their haunted denne To quench in gore their thirsting iawes, Whom sent of slaughter thither drawes. The grisly Beares do leaue their caues, And on these festred bodies raues: The filthy dogges forsake their homes, And all about these fat fields romes: And whatsoeuer else by kinde, With senting nose can sauors winde, When as the aire is putrifide With carkasses long mortifide. And hither flocks of fowles do throng, That both the camps had followed long. And those same birds that change the aire Of Thracian cold, and do repaire Vnto the gentle Southerne blast, Where they the streames of Nylus tast. So many vultures thither flie, As neuer earst did clowd the skie. With other rauenous foules of pray, Which euery wood sent day by day. And to the branches, boughs, and leaues, The clotterd gore and bowels cleaues That these birds brings, and oft withall, Vpon the victors heads doth fall. And on those wicked ensignes borne, The flesh and guts that they had torne, Which from their weary talents slip, Hauing got more then they could grip. Neither could they so sharke and share The flesh, whereby the bones were bare. All was not made a pray to beasts, They were so glutted with these feasts, As that they now began to loath The inwards and the marrow both. And onely on choise morsels feede, Most of the lims of Latium breede. Vnto long time to wet and heate They left to rot and would not eate. So as whole troops in heaped bands, Lay festring there, and dung'd the lands. O Most vnhappy Thessaly! How hast thou wrong'd the Gods on hie, That thou shouldst be so pestered With cruell slaughters and bloodshed? What future age or tract of time, May well repaire this bloody crime, Or lodge this in obliuous graue? VVhat corn bringst thou that shal not haue (Vpon his blade) a bloody staine, To shew these slaughters in thy graine? VVhat plow-share can here furrows rend But they will Roman ghosts offend? And yet new armies here shal meet, And with like rage each other greete: Before that euer thou canst drye The blood, that in thee now doth lie. Should we our sires sepulchers rake. And of their tombes a ruine make? Searching the depth to find the chest, And lay all open where they rest? More cynders yet there would be found Turnd vp in the Æmonian ground, By force of crooked cultors share, VVhen as the plowman tilleth there, And more bones spuing out their marrow, Crusht with the iron-toothed harrow. No marriner though tempest tost VVould euer anchor on this coast. No tilsman would plow vp these fields, That vnto Romans buriall yeelds. Their ghosts wold cause the peasants quake The droues the pastures would fosake. The shepheards durst not be so bold Their fleecie flocks to feede and fold That they their hunger might suffise On grasse, that from our bowels rise. But thou Emathia as forlorne. VVouldst humane races hold in scorne. As if thou wert that torrid soyle. That Phœbus beams doth alwaies broile. Or else that frozen ycie land That vnderneath the pole doth stand. Vnknowne so wouldst thou lie vnman'd. Had this bene but thy first wars blame, Not seconded with like defame: O Gods if that we may detest A land were wickednesse doth rest! Why doth this soyle the world oppresse, And so bring mankinde to distresse? The bloudy battell fought in Spaine, The horrors on Pachinus maine, Mutinas, and the Lucan fleetes Do wipe away Philippos greetes. Finis Libri Septimi. The eighth Booke. The Argvment. Pompey repulst and put to flight, By secret waies in great affright, Himselfe first at Larissa showes, And then by seas to Lesbos goes. Where all that people him bewailes, Thence with his mournfull wife he sailes Vnto Cælicia, whither came His sonne, and other Lords of name. There they consult what land to seeke, Accursed Ægypt best they like. Where he no sooner did arriue, But king and Councell did contriue His present death; and to that end They thaiterously Achilles send, Who in the presence of his wife, And of his sonne, bereft his life. Codrus his seruant with his hands Scrapes him a graue amongst the sands. Now Pompey forward hasting posts Ouer the Herculean coasts Then thorow Tempes woody waies Æmonian forrests he displaies, And desart passages assayes. His steede, though stroken with the spurre, Would scarcely forward go or sturre. Pompeys fears and suspitions in his flights So was he spent and ouer heate With running long, and faint with sweate. Besides amaze him so did fright, That he stood doubtfull in his flight, What course to take, or where to rest, But in and out his way doth wrest. The murmuring that the winds doth make Amongst the woods when leaus did shake Causde him for very feare to quake. His traine that follow him behind A terror are vnto his minde. And those that gallop by his sides, The iealously of feare. Perplexe him also as he rides. For though he were from that high place Throwne downe, and out of Fortunes grace Yet therewithall he vnderstood, That no base prise was worth his blood. But mindfull of his former state, He knew twas yet at so hie rate That Cæsar would giue for head, As much as he then valued The price of Cæsar to be slaine, And would bestow his head to gaine. But now he finds no secret place Could serue to hide his honoured face. For many that do take his part, Now comming to Pharsalias Mart (The fame as yet not being blowne, That all was lost and ouerthrowne) Were much amazed in their mind, Pompey in that same place to find. And scarcely would beleeue the truth That he himselfe relates with ruth. But grieuous was all company To him in this calamity, Pompey affects a retired life hating all popularitie. No peoples concurse he desir'd But from the world to liue retir'd. In safetie with obscured name: But Fortune that vnconstant Dame On him poore man her frowns doth cast To blanch her many fauours past, So as the waight of his renowne, His happinesse doth more presse downe, And with the more offensiue hate, His former blisse doth exprobate. The remembrance of former felicities is grieuous in aduersitie.For now he thinks his honors past, Were heaped on him too too fast. And doth accurse those Syllan bayes, The glory of his youthfull dayes. It irkes him now, deiected wight, To thinke vpon his Nauall fight, And those braue ensignes that he wonne, In Pontycke kingdome ouerrunne. Long life doth manly courage bate, And he that in empiring state No man happy but in his end. Hath alwaies liu'd, except withall In blisse he close his funerall. And doth with speedy death preuent, The change that fortune would present. He hath but liu'd to see his shame, And hath outliu'd his honors name. For who would fortunes fauours trie Except he can resolue to die. Now hath he to the shore attain'd Peneius riuer that runs betweene Olympus and Ossa.Whereas Pœneius streame distain'd With blood of the Pharsalian fields, Her Tribute to the Ocean yeelds. There fearefully he takes a boate Vnfit in winds and waues to floate. Which scarcely safe did him conuey, Vpon the riuer, to the bay. For yet she coasted with her oares, Corcyras and Leucades shoares, This Cylicke, and Lyburnicke Lord, In those lands earst so much ador'd, Embarks him here with mickle feare, Into a little Passenger. And with a mind fraught full of cares, Pompey embarks himselfe for the Isle of Lesbos. His course for Lesbos he prepares. Where thou Cornelia didst reside And there more heauy dayes hadst tride, Then if thou hadst encamped laine, With Pompey in Pharsalias plaine. Presages great of future ill, Her vexed thoughts do fright and fill. And in in her sleepings heauinesse: Oft trembling fits did her oppresse She sees Thessalia field by night. And when that Phœbus spreads his light. Vnto the loftie Cliffes she hies, Corneliascare of Pompeys And to the shore that vtmost lies Where on the maine she casts her eyes, And if she will first of all discouer: If any sayles do that way houer. And yet to aske she is a dread, How Pompey in the warre hath sped. But now behold his ship doth stand Full with the hauen of this land, And with all sayles doth hither presse, Thogh with what news thou canst not gesse. Till at the length greefe to reuiue, Thy conquered husband doth arriue. The heauie messenger of warres, The Harrold of hearts-wounding scarres. Why dost thou now lose time to wayle, When thou maist weep, feare doth preuaile But as the ship drew neare at hand, In hast she runs vnto the strand. And there she quickly did descrie, The cruell blame of Destinie. Pompey after the ouerthrow arriues at Lesbos where Cornelia was. Her Lords discolloured deadly face, Whose hoarie haires about it trace, Rough and vnkombt; and his attire Dasht and besprent with dust and mire. Wherewith this poore astonisht wight, Was ouercome with deaths darke night, That from her eyes depriu'd the light. Faint sorrow did her sprites inuest, Downe right she sinkes life leaues her brest. Cornelia fals into a swoone with sorrow.Her lims were starke, her heart grew colde, A deadly trance her hope doth holde. By this their Anchors being cast, Were with their cables mored fast. Pompey beholds the vacant sand, Where as his faithfull seruants stand. Who secretly their griefs do show, Amongst themselues with inward woe, And mournfull sighs which they bestow, Such as well sorted with his fate. And therewithall they eleuate In vaine their mistresse from the ground, That there halfe dead lay in a sound. Whom Pompey colleth in his armes, And her lims with embracements warmes. Then as the blood return'd againe, And did begin to strength each vaine: Her husbands hand she felt withall, And to her mind his face did call. Pompey comforts Cornelia with a braue speech.He wils her not to stoope to fate, Nor yet her griefs to aggrauate. O why shouldst thou a woman borne Of so great blood, like one forlorne? Thy noble heart and comfort breake, With the first blow of Fortunes freake, A meane is offered now to raise, Thy glory to all future daies. The praise wherein thy sex hath part, Is not for letters, nor for Mart. Thy honor is thy constancie, Vnto thy spouse in miserie. Lift vp thy sprites with pious thought, Set all the scornes of fate at nought. Me (though subdude) loue as before, Thy glory shall be so much more. Now that my honors all are fled, And that I am abandoned. Of all the Senates sacred troope, And of great kings that late did stoope Vnto my hest; Now be thou knowne Pompeys deare constant frend alone. Too much thou greeuest with Pallid face, Since that thy husband is in place. Thy sorrow now is at that height As greater cannot vexe thy spright, But to bewayle thy Pompey so, Should be the last loue thou shouldst show Vnto him dead; as yet no harmes, Accrewes to thee by ciuil armes. Pompey in health doth liue as yet, Though fortunes fauours from him flit. Meaning for the losse of his glory. To that therefore thy loue was bent, For which thou mak'st so great lament. VVhen these words in her ears did sound Her faint lims scarse she lifts from ground. VVhen as her voyce at last she strains, And in this sort her state complains. VVould God I had bene destined To Cæsars wracke; in mariage bed. Coruelia replies to P?pey Then had not both my nuptiall ioyes, Twice wrongd the world with these annoies Erynnis first in wedlocke state, To Crassus did me consecrate: And so deuoted to his hands, This was Crassus sonne, a braue yong nobleman slaine in the Parthian wars with his father the rich Crassus a Roman Senatour. I brought the wracks of Parthian lands, Amongst the Roman martiall bands. Now ciuill harmes do follow me, And thy iust cause; the Gods do flee By my default; O worthy Pheere, My haplesse match thou boughtst too deare. Had Fortune power to shew such spight: Vpon so great and braue a knight. Accursed wretch, why did I match My selfe to thee, these harmes to hatch, Now let me thereof bide the paine, VVhich I will take without disdaine, And that the seas may be more milde, And faith of kings rest vndefilde. And all the world to thee stand fast, Into these deepes my body cast. For would my head were damn'd to die, So thou mightst conquest gaine thereby Iulia the daughter of Cæsar, Pompeys late wife.Now Pompey make thy losses knowne, And Iulia let thy spight be showne. Where so in ciuill camps thou haunt, And on my bed thy vengeance vaunt. Be present here me to torment, Let thy wroth on me wretch be spent. Thy Pompey spare: so hauing said, Her grieued head againe she laid Vpon her husbands wofull brest, And in his armes awhile did rest. These words causd many a waterie eye, Amongst the troops of standers by. And Pompeys heart euen duld with cares, For second sorrow now prepares. Thus Lesbos from his eyes did straine, Teares, that Pharsalia could not gaine. The oration of the citizens of Mitilen to Pompey.By this from Mitilen great store Of people came, that fill'd the shore. And said to Pompey in this wise, Great honour must to vs arise For euermore, and to our state, So to be trusted with the Mate Of noble Pompey, as whose thrals We now deuote our eitty wals With sacred vowes; and do thee pray That thou one night with vs wouldst stay, And vs vouchsafe thy hosts to be, Our houshold Gods shall welcome thee. O Pompey by this grace of thine, Make vs to future ages shine. That Roman guests that seeke this shore, May for thy sake loue vs the more. No cittie in this conquered state, Now better sorteth with thy fate. All places now in hope may stand, For fauour at the victors hand. Already we haue run the race The Mitelens hopelesse of Cæsars fauour. That vs hath brought in his disgrace. What though our Isle lye in the maine; Can Cæsars Nauy vs constraine? Of Senators the greatest part Some certaine place will hold for Mart. Thou maist againe repaire thy fame In some one coast of noted name: The treasures of our Temples hold, Our Gods to thee shall giue their gold. Mitelen wholly deuotes it self to Pompey. Our men and ships as thou shalt please, Shall be imploy'd by land or seas. And Lesbos worth what it can make, Vse as thy owne and freely take. And lest that Cæsar it possesse, Take it to thee in thy distresse. And this suspect take from our land, That haue desir'd it at thy hand. That as when thy estate was hye, Thou in our faith didst trust affye. So now in thy aduersity Seeme not to doubt our loyalty. This deere deuotion of their part, Did greatly comfort Pompeys heart; And vnto him no little ioy, To finde such faith in most annoy. No land that's vnder heau'n (quoth he) Hath deerer been then yours to me. Pompeys answere to the Mitelens. And such my trust I did approue With this great pledge of my hearts-loue, For I to Lesbos trusty state Committed my deere spoused mate: Here was my sacred mansion, And Gods of my deuotion. The confid?ce that Pompey had in the Mitelens. Another Rome to me this was; And when my ship to seas did passe, To this place first I tooke my flight, And on no other shore would light. Now since I know that Cæsar hath Against this state conceiued wrath, Because that during this our strife, You safely guarded Pompeys wife. Thinke you that I would now refraine To put my trust in you againe, As though that now you stood in awe, Pompey acknowledgeth the Mittilens to be in Cæsars disgrace for his sake. Cæsars dislikes on you to draw? When as I know that for our sakes, Already he as foes you takes. No, now about the world must I New forces seeke, and fortunes try. Lesbos famous for faith to Pompey.Alas! how happy Lesbos name, Will through all Ages flye with fame? Whether by thy example led, I shall by Kings be succoured: Or else that Lesbos hath alone To Pompey so great kindnesse showne. For now I haue resolu'd my minde To trye where I may comfort finde, And who to me will be vnkinde: And if that any Gods there be, That the protection takes of me: Pompeys request to the Gods.To them my last petitions are, That they the peoples hearts prepare, As faithfully to me to stand, As doe the people of this land. That though I now be put to flight, Yet for all that in Cæsars spight, Their gates may be reserued still For me to come and go at will. So hauing said, euen with that word, The griefe of the Mittilens for Cornelias departure.His wofull wife he takes aboord: The Mitelens such mone then make That one would thinke they did forsake Their natiue soyles; for on the strands They cry and waile, and wring their hands. But Pompeys fortune lesse they mournd, Then hers that with them had soiourn'd So long in all this ciuill broyle, So as the people of this soyle Lamented, as if they had lost A Citizen they loued most. The Matrons all held her so deere, That had she gone vnto her Pheere In happy state, with conquest gain'd, Yet had they not from teares refrain'd. So had she with her kinde respects Oblig'd to her their deere affects, Her vertue and her modest grace, Her milde aspect and louely face In all their hearts had tane such place. For she was of such humble cheere, The loue and honour that the Mitelens bare to Cornelia for her sweet bahauiour. Though wife to such a mighty Peere, That she to them gaue no dislike, But liued as a guest full meeke; As though that she for succour came, And not as noble Pompeys Dame Left there when he his fortunes ioy'd, But as the wife of one destroy'd. Tytan began now to decline, So as one halfe of his bright shine Was hid from vs within the seas; The other halfe th' Antipodes Did then behold; so as nor wee Nor they, could then his full eye see. But Pompey now could take no rest, Cares impediments to quiet sleepe. So many cares torment his breast. Sometimes he calles vnto his minde, How many Cities were combin'd By league vnto the Roman state, How many Kings confederate Of diuers humors, tooke their part, Whom he might draw againe to Mart. Sometimes he thinkes vpon the South, Whose lands the Sunne hath parch't with drouth. And thus a world of cares and toyle In his perplexed breast doe broyle. Sometimes in hope to leuy Armes: Sometimes in dread of future harmes. Pompey conferres with his Pilot about his course. Then with the Maister he confarres About the motions of the starres; And how the Coasts and lands doe lye, The signes of weather in the skye, And when 'tis fit to hull or trye: Or else with sailes to cut the deepes, What starre the Syrian quarters keepes; Or what starre in the waine best stands, To guide a course for Lybian lands. This skilfull Pilot that had oft And long, these Nauall Courses sought, And secret mysteries of the skies, In this sort vnto him replies: The Pilots answere to Pompey.We neuer (wretched Mariners) Do make our recknings by those starres That wandring still rowle to and froe, We might be much deceiued so. But such as do not range nor role, But are still fixed neere the pole, And neuer in Neptunus deepes His fiery twinkling torchet steepes: But alwayes shines in one set place, By it we doe direct our race: And when this starre aloft doth tend, And that the lesser Beare is kend, Iust poynting on my maine yards end. The Bospheros maine we doe explore, And Seas that Circle Scythias shore. But if Arctophilax discend, The Pilots obseruations.The least poynt from our Top-masts end, And that the little Beare appeare Vnto the seas somewhat more neere, For Syrias ports our course we steere. But with Canopas, South we runne, For he the Northerne clime doth shunne. Or if he keepe our Larbord side, And so our helme for Pharos guide: Then in the middle of that maine, Our ships vpon the Syrts might straine. But now I would be glad to know Your will, and whither you would goe: And what coast fits best your auaile, Accordingly to set our saile. Pompey to this vnconstantly With doubtfull humour doth reply. Alwayes (quoth he) for our behoofe, See in those seas you keepe aloofe Prmpey directs his Pilot what coasts to shun That are from Thessaly remote, And neere Hesperia do not flote. Shunne you those seas or shores to finde, Commit the rest vnto the winde. My wife aboord with me shall stay, From Lesbos I tooke her away; Thither I did a due course bend, But Fortune now a port must lend. Thus hauing said, the Pilot hailes, The Marriners do cut their sailes. The sheats that equally inclin'd, But spooned iust before the wind. He veares now to the larboord side, One tacke vnto the prow he tide, The other on the sturne belayes, And to Assinas coast assaies; And where the surging billow shockes Alongst the Isle of Chyos rockes. Now angry Neptune frothing chides, Whilst that the ship thus stemmes the tides: And all the while she holds her course, Vpon the construction of this Simile all the Commentators do vary &amp; are doubtfull. He roring fometh worse and worse. With no such ease and speedy change The Coach-man can his Charret range From right hand to the left hand side, When he his trampling steeds would guide: And circling wheeles about doth trend, First to attaine his races end. Phœbus vnto the world giues light, And dimmes the stars that shines by night, When those that now did scattring flye From this late storme in Thessaly; With all speed after Pompey runne, And on the seas he meetes his sonne; Yet scarce cleare of the Lesbian coast, And then more Princes of his hoast, That earst to him had faithfull bin, And in this state he now was in; A fugitiue and ouer-throwne, The Easterne Princes stand firme to Pompey in his distresse.Did still to him their loue make knowne. And many Kings with martiall traines, That in the Easterne clymats raignes, And other Lords of powerfull states, For all his wracked exil'd fates, Stood firme his faithfull constant mates. King Deiotarus, one of those That scap't away with Cæsars foes, Did follow Pompey in his flight, And was employ'd to raise new might. Pompeys words to king Deiotarus.To him his charge in these words giues; Thou faithfulst king to me that liues, Since that the Roman power and host In the Æmathian fight is lost; Go try the fauour of the East, As those that need feare Cæsar least: The Nations that the waters drinkes Of Euphrates and Tygris brinkes. To Pompey it shall be no griefe In this distresse to craue reliefe Of Medes, whereby to wage new warre, And Scythians, though remote so farre; But vtterly to change our clyme, And vse requests in this hard time To proud Arsaces for his aid, And if old leagues be not decay'd, But still in memory are borne: Then by that God that I haue sworne, The thundring Ioue of Latium land, And by that holy reuerent band Of Magi, that your oathes did binde, Prepare your selues in warlike kinde: Your quiuers fill with shaft and dart, And your Armenian bowes for Mart, Bended with strings of Getan Art: And if (ô Parthians) heretore To warre on you I haue forbore: When I did range the Caspian maine, And with my Army did constraine The fierce Alani to my yoke, And neuer did the Parthes prouoke. None did destroy, or seeke their soyle, Nor did enforce them to entoyle Pompeys fauor to the Parthians. Themselues, their children, and their wiues, For safe-gard of their goods and liues, Within the Babylonian walles, Nor euer sought to make them thralles. But when I conquer'd Persean Realmes, And the Caldean vtmost streames. Swift Ganges and Hydaspis fierce, That through the Eastern lands doth pierce, Wasting Nyseas ancient walles, And so into the Ocean falles; Where Phœbus lifts his shining face, I neerer Parthes then Persia was. Yet when I had subdu'd all these, My Armes in nought did them disease. Nor yet were they, mongst all the rest, For honour of my triumphes prest. They onely were exempt by me Of all the Easterne Kings as free: With such desert I did them binde, And shall I Parthes vngratefull finde? Nay more then this Arsaces race At Pompeys hand hath found like grace. For after that same bloody strife, Where Crassus lost his host and life, What Romans could their hands containe From Parthes, that all our host had slaine? Oblig'd to me by such desarts, Pompey for reuenge would ioyne with the Parthes the most inueterate enemies of the Romans state. Let them the like shew on their parts. Now let the Parthes with Trumpets sounds Breake out in force beyond their bounds: And Zeugma that same Palean Towne, Let them surprise, or batter downe. Yee Parthes for Pompey conquest gaine, To conquer Rome is worth your paine. The King did no refusall make This hard request to vndertake; But presently aside did lay His Royall Robe and rich array: And in the habit him attires Of one of his inferior Squires. Tis safe for Kings in ieopardie To counterfeit base pouerty. How much therefore doth lowly need For safety greatest Kings exceed, Freer from dangers and from dreed? The King in this sort set on shore, Pompey then plies both saile and oare, Till he th' Icarian cliffe had past, Pompeys nauigation, his wife beeing with him.From Ephesus he bends his mast; And Colophonas pleasant waues, And Samos rockes that foaming raues. And then a gentle puffing gale His sailes from Coös coasts did hale. Gnydon he leaues, and Rhodes doth shunne, That voue their Altars to the Sunne. Then that great bay Telmesydos Aloofe he flies, and ouer-goes: And from the middle of the maine Pamphilias coast appeared plaine. But yet he would not make aduenter Phaselis, a little Iland in the Mediterane.Within a walled towne to enter. Little Phaselis was the coast That Pompey first did make his oast. The slender habitation there Made him the lesse the place to feare: The empty houses people needed, His ship their troope by farre exceeded. From hence againe his course he bends, And sees how Taurus mountaine trends, Whence Dypsas to the seas discends. Would Pompey euer this suspected When he the Pyrates force subiected, Or euer in his minde haue thought That to this stresse he should be brought For safety so to range the maine, In one poore ship with so small traine. But now the Senates greatest part Escaped from Pharsalias Mart, Together met, though put in rout, And at the length found Pompey out; At anchor in the little port The Senators escaped from the battaile, come to Pompey. Calendrys hight, where great resort Of shipping passeth to and froe, As Selyns streame doth ebbe or flow. Pompey at length with heauy cheere, Desired them these words to heare; Companions deere in warre and flight, The modell of our Countries right: Pompeys oration to the Roman Lords that escaped from the battaile. Although that now to this bare coast By wretched Fortune we be tost, Consulting on Cylicias strands, Not guarded with our armed bands: Yet now we must begin againe New proiects, warres to entertaine. To your braue mindes good comfort yeeld, All fell not in Pharsalias field: Nor am I so with fate opprest, But that I can raise vp my crest, And scorne the blow that vs distrest. Could Marius in the Lybicke soyle Repaire againe his bitter foyle, And win to him a Consuls state, And fixe his fame in Roman date? And thinke you I through Fortunes spight Will be supprest with lesser might? In Grecian seas for my auaile I doe retaine a thousand saile, And haue as many Captaines more That will attend me on the shore. Our force this battaile rather parted Then any way the same subverted. My fame that is of such account, Can easily this losse surmount. The whole worlds force I soone will moue, My onely name so much they loue. Do you consider and aduise What Realmes or States most fittest lies Pompey desires them to giue their opinions for aids to bee sought.To serue vs now for our availe, Whose force and faith will not vs faile: Whether that Lybia be the place, Or Ægypt now as stands the case, Or Parthians friendship we embrace. Which of all these you estimate Worthiest to aid the Roman state. For me, my Lords, I will disclose In my conceit what I suppose: Pompey sets down his conceit for succours.And all my reasons lay downe flat That leads my minde to this or that. The Nylus King is but a youth, And that makes me to doubt his truth; For constant faith more sure doth rest Within a graue and manly breast. The Moore I do no whit applaud, We all do know them full of fraud. And how that wicked Carthage race Hath alwayes practis'd Romes disgrace We right well know; and that there rests More Hanniballes yet in their breasts. And as for the Numidian Kings, That now from bastards races springs, Whose murdrous hands the blood distaines Of their true lawfull soueraignes; And did of late with so great pride Varus that led our force, deride; Meaning king Iuba.Who sought his aid, and with disgrace Alotted Rome a second place. This makes me thinke tis best we proue Our friends by East, and trust their loue. Great Euphrates with his vaste streames Diuides and boundeth many Realmes. The Caspian sea hath limits large, And harbours safe within his varge. In other sort the heauens aspects, Th' Assirian dayes and nights directs. That sea is of another staine, And flat secluded from our maine: Their people conquering humors beare, And for the warres large Coursers reare. VVith stronger bowes they battaile wage, The yong and old, and euery age Affects his vigrous draught to show, Each arrow giues a deadly blow. The Parthes were first that brake the rankes Crassus extols the Parthian forces. Of Alexanders piked slanks. And Bactra that same Citty great VVonne from the Medes, their Regal seate, And Babylon with walles so hye, That doth Assiria dignifie. Our Piles the Parthians holds slight, And in the field with vs dare fight: And with what force Scythes arrowes flye, Crassus defeat too well did try: They haue not onely heads of steele, VVhose piercing force their foes do feele; But poyson on those heads they fixe, So as if any place it prickes, The smallest wound death with it brings, And all the blood with venome mings. VVould God no cause did me encline To trust to proud Arsaces line. The Parths enemies to the Romans These Parthes with their subsisting fate Our Empire still did emulate: And all the heauenly powers with grace Haue lookt vpon the Parthian race. But I would also send for bands, And valiant troopes from other lands. The furthest East I would incite To send to vs their Martiall might. But if the Easterne faith refuse, So as their aid we cannot vse, And the Barbarian leagues doe faile, Let Fortune strike my ship-wracke saile, And me conuay to vnknowne coasts, Pompey scorns to seeke to those Nations that he hath triumphed ouer.Neuer subdu'd by Roman hoasts. I neuer basely meane to pray Their aid, that earst did me obay. Twill comfort me when as I dye, That in strange climes my limbes shall lye, Whereby proud Cæsar shall not haue The power to grace or wrong my graue. And I will onely meditate The glory past of my liues fate, Which that worlds part did celebrate. What was beyond Meotis lake, And what scope Tannais did take Pompey famous in the East parts of the world.With her streames trending in the East, So farre hath my renowne encreast. To what lands hath my name more runne For famous conquests by me wonne? Or else from whence hath my desarts More triumphs gaind then from those parts? O Rome! my enterprise now guide, VVhat greater boone can heauens betide To thee, then in this ciuill Mart To see the Parthians beare a part; So to consume them with our Armes, And mix their wrackes amongst our harmes. A reason why to take aid of the Parthes.For when that Cæsars forces stands Encountring with the Parthian bands, Fortune must me the victor make, Or else for Crassus vengeance take. Thus said, he saw the Senates minde Stood not to his aduice enclin'd. But Lentulus amonst the rest VVhom vertues courage forwards prest, And noble griefe for Roman fate He holding then the Consuls state, A braue oration of the Consull Lentulus in answere of Pompey.His worthy voyce did eleuate. Hath so this late Thessalian blow Thy minde deiected and brought low? Hath one dayes fate the world opprest? Must we amongst our selues contest? Now after this Æmathian wound, Doth that all hope of helpe confound? Hath Fortune Pompey all bereft, That he in Parthians hands is left? Why shouldst thou as a runnagate, So range the world to mend thy fate? In forraine climes, and in such lands As to our state malignant stands? And stars that vs no good lucke bods Wilt thou adore Chaldean Gods? And with Barbarian rites polluted, Lentulus reprooues Pompeys humour to the Parths. Be now the Parthians thrall reputed? Why did we first to armes discend, Our libertie but to defend? O wretch thou didst the world delude If thou canst liue in seruitude. Shall Parth that thee beheld with hate, A ruler in the Roman state? That saw thee from Hyrcania leade Great kings thy captiues; and with dread Beheld the Indians conquered. See thee deiected and cast downe, And basely yeeld to fortunes frowne. Whilst they puft vp in mind with pride, Do but the Latium name deride. And value Rome lesse then their state, To see thee so degenerate. O Pompey in thy speech we finde, Nought suting with thy worth or mind, The Parth that doth not vnderstand The language of the Latium land, Abase reproch to Pompey. When thou of him dost aide request, By teares thy mind must be exprest. Shall we this wounding scorne endure, That Parths shall our reuenge procure? Rather then Rome with her owne armes Shall remedy Hesperias harmes. Did she for this thee chieftaine make, That thou no more regard shouldst take, But spread abroad with such disgrace, Her maymes vnto the Scythian race, And secret scarres; her to deface. What wilt thou teach the Parthian swarmes, The way to vexe vs with their armes? Hath Rome the hoped comfort lost, Of such a warre and such an host? Because no kings she would obey, But that her Citizens should sway, And wilt thou now the wide world range, To bring whole nations fierce and strange To ransacke Rome? that will display Those ensignes that they wonne away From Crassus, when they vanquished, And must from Euphrates be led, And here to our disgrace be spred? That king that vs his aide denide, The vnlikelihood of Parthian aides.When as our Fortune was vntride, And came not to Emathia field, To vs will he now comfort yeeld, And so prouoke the victors spight, Whom he doth heare to be of might. And now will Pompeys fortunes runne; Such trust with them did neuer wonne. The nations of the Northerne climes, Where fals the dewes and foggie rimes, Are stout in warre and feare not death, But those that in the East take breath, And leade their liues in warmer soyles, Luld in sweet aire, hate martiall broyles. You see what loose attires and vailes Their men do weare that flit like sailes, The Parth vpon the Median fields And Sarmates downes that large scope yeelds The nature &amp; manner of Parthias fight.And on those plains by Tygris bankes, VVhen they in length may streach their ranks And at their pleasure come and goe, Cannot be vanquisht by a foe, But where the soyle is full of hills These horsmen come not by their wills, Their roaming bow can make no fight, In bushie straights, or in the night When need requires they neuer guides Their horse to swim from sides to sides, Nor with their armes stem streaming tides. Nor yet will they their fight make good, When as their bodies bathe in blood: Nor yet endure the parching heate, Nor in the dust to toyle and sweate. They haue no engins for the warre, For rams they know not what they are, They want the art a trench to fill, And he the Parth repulseth still; And as a wall doth him oppose, That can keep out weake arrowes blows. His battell weake, his warre is flight, His troops still ranging and but slight, A souldier fit to quit a place, But not to put his foe to chace. The Parths no souldiers disciplined. His armes defilde with poysons art, He dares not come to handy Mart, A farre off he his shafts doth dart. VVith euery blast of wind they flit And as it blowes they misse or hit. The sword is of more great import, And best with valiant men doth sort, The Fauchion sharpe; but the first fight Disarmes the Parths of all their might, For when their quiuers emptied are, They do retire and end their warre, They neuer trust vnto their hands, In poysned shafts their furie stands. O Pompey in the chance of warre, Thinkst thou it doth nor make nor marre, The sword the chiefe weapon of all armes. VVhether the souldier do prouide A trusty sword girt to his side? And doth thy case thee so constraine, That thou wouldst worthlesse aid retaine? And nations so remote wouldst trie, And out of thine owne countrey die? Is some Barbarian land design'd, The place where thou thy graue must find? There some base shrine thy lims shall haue, Since they would not vouchsafe a graue, To Crassus that his fate complaines, But better hap for thee remains. For our last paine with death is fled, Which manly hearts do neuer dread. For death Cornelia needs not care That wicked King her life will spare. We well do know the barbarous rites That they do vse in loues delights, And how like to the brutish beasts, All humane laws their lusts detests. With wiues they neuer contracts hold, The luxury &amp; impudent venery of the Parths.But like to swine they do vnfold The secrets of the nuptiall bed, And that same Tyrants court is sped With thousands for his concubines, After his feasts and change of wines. One man prouoketh his delight With sundry women euery night, The brothers with the sisters weds, The sonnes defile their mothers beds, That wicked rumour that doth run Of Oedepus that Theban sonne, How doth the world condemne and loth, Although vnwitting to them both, How often hath Arsaces race, That holds in Parth the regall place, By this incestious sauage moode He speakes of Cornelias dan ger and dishonour to liue amongst the Parthes concubines.Commixed bene with slauish blood. So as great Scipios noble child, Shall not all onely be defilde, But with a thousand more be wed, As wiues to this Barbarians bed. Although his kingly lust and flame, Stird vp with beauty of the dame. And glory of her husbands name Will make him more to her incline, Then any other Concubine. For how much more the Parth delights, In humane wrackes and foule despights, He wil know her for Crassus mate, As destin'd to the Parthian fate, And deeme that she her selfe must owe A captiue for that ouer-throw. O let that miserable foyle Of Easterne wounds, in thy breast boyle: And bee not onely thou asham'd That to a base King thou hast fram'd Petitions, for to lend thee aid; Burbe thou all as much dismaid, That first thou ciuill armes displaid: For no fault more the people loth Acted by thee and Cæsar both, This ciuill wars did hinder the reuenge of Crassus and his army lost. Then that you two by ciuill warre Reuenge for Crassus doe debarre. Our Captaines all should then haue tryde Their force against their Parthian pride, And rather then haue Armies wanted, The Northern climes should haue displanted A braue speech. And from the Dakes and from the Rhene The Roman Legions withdrawen cleane, And so strong forces to prouide, Haue bar'd the Empire on that side. Vntill perfidious Susis towne, And Babylon they had throwne downe. To serue the Crassi for their tombe, As monuments to honour Rome. To fortune we our prayers send, That with the Parths our peace may end. And if Thessalias battell past, Hath giuen this ciuill warre his last, Let him that conquest doth enioy, Against the Parths his force employ. That nation of the world alone Lentulus respects the honor of Rome more then his mallice to Cæsar. I could be glad were ouerthrowne By Cæsars armes, and that for it, He might in triumphs charret sit, Thinke that ere thou with sucst an host Couldst passe Araxes frozen cost. A supposition of that Crassus ghost should say to Cæsar.Old Crassus shade with heauy cheare, Stitcht full of darts would first appeare Before thy face; and thus would speake O thou that shouldst due vengeance wreake, For this huge slaughter on vs made, Thou whom we did our hopes perswade, Wouldst giue our naked bones a graue, That now in mould no rest can haue, Camst thou a league and peace to craue: Then will those slaughters memories, Present themselues before thine eyes, When on the walls with stakes yborne, Those heads thou seest set vp in scorne, And Euphrates that did confound So many Lords in her streames drownd, And Tygris that our bodies slaine, Did vnder earth a time retaine, And then disgorged them againe. If with thy mind thou canst dispense, To passe by these without offence, A tant to Pompey.As well maist thou ô Pompey yeeld Thy selfe vnto Pharsalias field, Where Cæsar sitting Conquerour. Thou mercy maist of him emplore. But better weigh our Roman cause, If thou dost feare those Tyrants paws, That in the South haue residence, And Iubas faithlesse insolence. Lentulus allowes that succours may be sought of Ptolomey.Let Pharus King of vs be prayd, And Lagus Realme to yeeld vs ayd, The Lybicke Syrts do safely bound Vpon this side Ægyptian ground. And Nylus from all forreine foes, With his seuen heads doth it inclose On tother side; and tis a land That of it selfe can liue and stand Contentedly; and needs not craue Her neighbors helpe; nor showres to haue Nylus doth so her pastures laue. Whose scepter Ptolemie a boy And regall crowne doth now enioy. Ptolomey a ward to Pompey. Besides to Pompey he doth rest Oblig'd, and by his sires bequest Thy pupill is, then who would feare A name that doth but shadow beares. His age as yet from guile is free, Such faith you could not looke to see, Such lawes or such integrities, Nor seruice to the Deities. In that kings court that raigned last, He meanes that the old king was fuller of wiles and impieties. Long rule all right doth ouercast. Vnder a king that newly raignes, All things are milde, noe force constraines. No more he sayd, this swaid their mind, What libertie last hopes do finde? To Pompeys censure none enclinde. Then they Cilician coasts forsake, And saile for Cyprus Isle doe make, Where Venus mindfull of that place, Ciprus, Venus Iland. In Paphos for the Ilands grace Her Altars keepes whence spring her race. If we may thinke that on the earth, The heauenly powers may take their birth. Or that the Gods (as some do raue) Like humane wights beginnings haue. When Pompey from this harbour wends, About the Cyprian cliffes he trends, And Southward doth his way direct, But with contrary tides was checkt That do alongst those channels sweepe, Pharos a tower where a great lanthorne was set to direct ships by night on those costs. Neither doth he a straight course keepe Towards mount Cassium, by the light That Pharus tower sets out at night. But fell with Ægypts lowest shore, Scarce stemming tides with sayle and oare. And hardly thither got withall Where Nylus parted greatest fall With her seuenth streame and mighty sway, Doth fall into Pelusium bay. It was the season and the time When Libra being in her prime, Indifferently the ballance swayes, With equall lengths of nights and daies. And Autums solstice now requits, By lengthning her ensuing nights, The houres that were tane away By springs solstice increasing day. Now when that Pompey had descride That Egypts king did then reside Neare Cassius mount he tacks about, Seeking a way to find him out, For yet did neither daylight faile, Nor had the ship yet stroken saile. The scouts on the coast discouer Pompeys ships.Forthwith the horse scouts that did stand For Centinels alongst the land, Alarums gaue to all the shores And sild the court with great vprores. The sudden comming of this man, For Counsell small time gaue them than. Yet all the vipers of that Court The Ægyptians go to co?sell.To consultation did resort Amongst the rest of all which Peeres, One Achoreus full of yeeres, A reuerent sire, whom schooling age More modest made, and free from rage. He was a natiue of that soyle That flowing Nylus doth entoyle. In Memphis he receiu'd his lore, That doth vaine Rites so much adore, VVhere hee had long time exercis'd (As Priest) the lawes they had deuis'd, Apis was a Bull that the Memphites honored as a God, wh? they suffered to liue but some few yeares, &amp; then tooke another in his place. Some name him Osyris.In honour of that horned beast VVhich they with deity inuest: To whom for name they Apis giue, Many of which hee did out-liue. This Achoreus counsell gaue, That faith and merite ought to haue A great respect vnto it borne, And that they ought not hold in scorne The plighted league and vowes of loue That this Kings father did approue. And vnto Pompey still profest, Here it seems the Authour was defectiue by iniury of time and Achoreus speech loft, which the translator supplied, as pertinent. By whom his kingdome he possest, For what quoth he can mortals bind To friendship in a higher kind, If kings and states no faith maintaine, How shall the vulgar truth retaine? When they by higher powers are taught All loyall trust to set at naught. Why do all kings their subiects sweare Fidelitie to them to beare, If that the kings owne actions teach? Of vowes and leagues to make a breach? When due respects failes in the head, How will the members be misled, We see that all the world is bent To seeke the way that Princes went. All kings by Ceremonies stand, By lawes they rule with powerfull hand. But if those lawes they vioalate, They weaken then their owne estate. Order and iustice the support of regall power. For where we setled order swayes Who there can rule, or who obayes? Where Iustice force doth strike no stroke, It there dissolues subiections yoake. When kings themselues lawlesse grow, They hazard then to ouerthrow Their owne estate; and teach that mind That is ambitiously enclind, How to aspire by fraud or might, To reaue away their soueraignes right. He that no good deserts obserues, The like at others hands deserues. Thy father did by Pompeys grace Pompey established Ptolomeys father in the kingdome. Of Soueraigntie obtaine this place, And so thy selfe enioyes this land, VVhich he receiu'd at Pompeys hand. For it he dy'd in Pompeys debt, VVhich fauour thou maist not forget. For thereby shall the Romane state, Esteeme thee but a Prince ingrate. And Cæsars selfe condemne thy mind As most disloyall and vnkind. Ptolomy wold haue done as much by Cæsar if he had bene in his mercie. And thinke how much thou wouldst him scorne, If he in like state were forlorne; And forc'd thy royall aid to craue, Of whom a friend no helpe could haue. In his braue mind he will thee deeme, A Prince of worth and more esteeme For fauouring Pompey in distresse, That at thy hands deserues no lesse, Then now to vse him with disdaine, In hope thereby Cæsar to gaine. A foe that man will dignifie, That helps his friend in miserie: Though treasons act secure his state, Yet Cæsar will the traytor hate, Ptolomey at the first aided Pompey against Cæsar.And thinke that thou to none dost beare Good will, but such as grows by feare, And therefore will the Roman state Deeme that thou didst both parties hate. But do not enuy'd courses proue, Thy greatnes rather ground on loue. With kings the noble Lyons port, Then Foxes wiles, doth better sort. Marius banisht recouered his honor againe in the Roman state. Pompey againe his head may raise, As Marius did in former dayes: Or if not so, yet are we sure, The Romane Empire will endure, For her foundation doth not stand, By Cæsars or by Pompeys hand. Her Peeres, her people, and her powre, One battell cannot so deuoure; That we should thinke we may disdaine Her Empire that doth still remaine. The bloody field at Cannas fought, More slaughter then Pharsalia wrought. And though that the Trebeian fight, And Tracimene did giue them flight, Yet Romes estate subsisted still, And did reuenge her selfe at will. For Hannibal was vanquished, And Carthage Empire ruined. Though thou no aide to Pompey giue, Yet like a king his wants releiue, And giue him safetie in thy lands, That custome with all Nations stands. For Cæsars selfe hath tride like grace When he did flie from Syllas face, And for the safetie of his head, Vnto king Nichomedes fled, And therefore doth by practise know, That kings in honour ought to show Kings inhonor ought to releeue distressed Princes for that it may be their owne ease. Remorse on him that comes a guest: For kings themselues may be distrest. And Ptolomie thy father late, Oppressed by his fathers hate, Was aided by the Roman state. Though Cæsar for a time may raigne, Rome euer an enemy to Monarchy. Yet Rome doth Monarchie disdaine. And her braue spirits that still liu'd free, To vassallage will not agree. Meane while defile not thou thy youth, Vngratefully vnto that truth Ingratitude reproued. That heretofore hath shewde such grace To thee, and to thy kingly race. Thy dying father did commend The care of thee as to a frend, To Pompeys trust, which in iust sort He did discharge and thee support. If this may not oblige thy mind, Who right of thee can hope to find., Be well aduisd and stand in awe, The worlds defame on thee to draw In thy yong yeares, for such a staine Will all thy life on thee remaine. The vessell alwayes holdeth fast The sent wherof it first did tast. Young yeares are apt to be distalned with ill manners &amp; euer to retain the tast therof But if thou wilt nor Pompey lend Thy aides; that Cæsar may offend; Nor in thy kingdome let him rest For safegard of his life distrest, Not with thy bountie him relieue That to thy fire this Crowne did giue. Yet him dismisse in courteous sort, When he sets saile to leaue this port. Harme not his life, he was thy frend, For that would men and Gods offend He disswades the king from vsing any violence to Pompey by the example of Busuris king of Egypt.All those that such vile acts haue done, Into the like mishaps haue runne. Busyris that with bloody vaine All strangers so did entertaine: Was vsde at last with like despight Reueng'd by the Herculean might. He that with blood vpholds his state The most do feare, and all do hate: And he that hated is of all Is sure into mischance to fall. That Counsellor that would thee good, Will thee dehort from Roman blood. For though the Romans now do iarre, And entertaine a ciuill warre. Long will they not be so beguilde, That mallice will be reconcilde. Meane while this warre vnto them showes Both fained friends and secret foes. And mischiefe then will sure betide To those that plaid on either side, For when this ciuill strife is dated, And forraine wrongs shall be debated, O then will they reuengement haue Of all that in their blood did raue. Therefore it thee concernes ô king, To looke what future change may bring. And not alone to meditate That it behooues Princes to loue &amp; eye to the future as well as to the present.The present ordring of thy state. The skilfull Pilot will not trust The glaring Sun, but doubts a gust, And doth accordingly prepare To haue his sailes and tackling yare. O Ptolomey then gouerne so, To giue no vantage to the foe. Giue no aduantage to a foe, nor off?ce to a true frend Nor yet to serue thy present ends, Too carelesse bee of tried frends. To this Photinus, prone to ill, (Who better knew with flattring skill To draw a Prince to tyrannize) In hate of Pompey thus replies. Rightfull respects (ô Ptolomey) Photinus wicked oration. Brings many Princes to decay. Obserued faith so much commended, Hath with repentance often ended, When men will striue to eleuate That Fortune meanes to ruinate. Machiauels Maister. The Fates and Gods obserue aright Thy wretches damn'd by their despight; Combine thou with the happy wight. As farre as is this earthly scope, Distant from high heauens vaulted cope, And fire and waues repugnant are: So truth and profite euer iarre. The power of Scepters then decayes, When truthes regards their actions swayes. Truth &amp; profit repugnant. Tis truly said that foolish pittie Hath oft confounded many a Cittie. Sly pollicie with searching ends, Envied Kingdomes states defends. Except the sword thou often draw Thou canst not make thy will a law: Do that and hold them all in awe. A perswasion to cruelty. O let him from a court depart, That hath a pious tender heart. Milde modesty and mighty power Cannot reside in one selfe bower. Feare still accosts Regality That is ashamd of cruelty. Not without ill intention borne, Pompey thy yong yeares so doth scorne; To thinke that thy vnconquer'd might From these shores cannot him affright. Such guests may not depriue thy throne, Heires thou hast neerer of thine owne. If Ægypts Scepter thou abhorre, Meaning Cleopatra, then in disgrace with her brother.Thy banisht sister then restorre. We will defend the kingdomes right Against the proud Italian might. What Pompey heretofore had not, Shall neuer be the victors lot. But now that Pompey is forlorne Of all the world, and Fortunes scorne; And no where intrest hath at all, He seekes with what land he may fall, His sence these ciuill broiles doe stall. Cæsar alone doth not him fright, But he doth shun the Senates sight; Of whom the greatest part and powre Thessalian vultures now deuoure. And all those Nations he doth dread Whose bloods together for him shed, He basely hath abandoned. And shames of those Kings to be knowne, He inuighes against Pompey.Whose Fortunes he hath ouer-throwne. Thessaly hath him guilty tride, Not knowing where his head to hide. He now accosteth Ægypts soyle, Which yet he hath not brought to spoyle. And giues vs by this vile pretence, Iust cause against him of offence. For why should he engage vs so That now rest free from warre or foe; And seeke to bring our land and state, So deeply into Cæsars hate? Is ours the Realme on which in spleene Thou faine wouldst lay Pharsalias teene, That with thy wrackes we ruin'd beene? Iust cause doth vs good leaue affoord To free this perill by the sword. But where 'tis vrg'd at thy request, The Senate did our King inuest With this Crowne; we for that againe, With aids, thy quarrell did maintaine. But now this sword worne by my side, Which fate now bids me to prouide, O Pompey must not thee offend, He speakes as indiffrent, not caring if both parties were ruined. But through the bowels shall transcend Of him that conquer'd was of late, I wish it rather Cæsars fate. We driuen are to go that way That Fortune goes, who all doth sway. Doubtst thou (O Pompey) if it be A course most needfull now for me To violate thy wretched life, When lawfull tis to free all strife? With what hope didst thou (haples wight) Desire vpon our coast to light? When we are not prepar'd for warre? Our people scarcely able are With spades to delue those clayie lands That Nylus softens to our hands. Tis fit to measure our owne force, And of our selues to take remorce. An argument against the aiding of Pompey, and wisely to consider their owne estate. Thou Ptolomey maist (if thou wilt) Mend Pompeys wracke that lies now spilt, When Rome it selfe dures for his guilt. Dar'st thou Thessalias ashes reare And call in warres thy realme to teare? Before these late Pharsalian broyles We kept our selues from martiall toyles. Would Pompey new warres vndertake With our hands, since all him forsake? Would he prouoke the victors might Againe, that hath put him to flight? And pitty tels vs (as you say) We should helpe wretches in decay. But wisedome sayes, we should affect The humor of true worldlings. To like those Fortune doth respect. What foolish trust would leagues combine With friends, in pouerty that pine? This wicked counsell all allowd, The boyish King was likewise proud Euill counsell soone folowed To haue the honour him decreed As lawfull to act such a deed, By Sycophants that sooth his minde, Whereto Achillas was design'd. And to the seas side they repaire, A wicked shore for this affaire. O this was that same trayterous land, That borders on the Cassian sand, Whereas on Ægypts coasts a shelfe Neere to the Syrts doth stretch it selfe. There they a little frigget mand With armed monsters in a band. O heauens! how could the riuer Nyle And barbarous Memphis so defile Themselues; and that same tender breed, That the Canopian Ile doth feed, The people about Nylus t?der and not martiall.Haue hearts to act so vile a deed? Doth ciuill fate the whole world staine? Must Roman Rulers thus be slaine? Doth Ægypt slaughters new affoord? Must Pharus on vs vse the sword? O ciuill warres, to your owne Armes Reserue our proper Countries harmes: And do reuenge your own blood spilt, Chase from you odious forraine guilt. If noble Pompey were design'd How disgracefull it was to Rome to haue her Peeres slaine by her tributary princes.By Cæsars sword his date to finde. Durst Ptolomy so traiterously Doome one of so great name to dye? And thou Achillas halfe a man, Thou Eunuch whom the world doth ban, How durst thou so with hands prophane (Whilst heauen did thunder) work his bane? Hee that the world by Armes hath tam'd, Him that three Triumphes so had fam'd, The Champion of the Senates state, The victors sonne-in-law but late. This might alone for reason stand To stay the Pharian Tyrants hand. He was a noble Roman borne, With thy sword must our breasts be torne? Little knowst thou (vnhappy boy) He reproues yong Ptolomy for this treachery. Little knowst thou thine owne annoy; How ficklely thy fortune stands, That by no right now holdst thy lands; Since him thy wicked sword hath slaine By whose grace thou didst rule and raine. Now Pompey strooken had his saile, And in his ship, for more auaile, His Marriners fell to the Ore, So to convey him to the shore. Thus passing on with his small fleet, A little Gally did him meet, Pompey prepares to goe a land in Ægypt That was with wicked villaines mand, VVith shew to bring him to the land. Then Ægypts kingdome they profest VVas to his loue and seruice prest. And therewithall they offer make The pret?ded shew of loue from the Ægyptian king to Pompey. That he the benefite would take Of their small skiffe to come a shore From his tall ship that could not more, Nor on those channels safely ride And very hardly stemme the tide; By reason that the checking waue Did with contrary currents raue: And to all shipping perilous A slight vsed to draw Pompey into their skiffe. That on those costs were venterous. But had not destiny ordain'd And that which could not be refrain'd, The doome of the æterne decree, To which his fate must needs agree; That Pompey to this shore must wend There to receiue his wofull end. He wanted not aduice of those That were his friends, to doubt these foes. For that if they good faith had meant, And that the King with true intent VVould welcome him vnto that land, Pompeys frends aledged a reason of suspition. Giuen to his sire by Pompeys hand. The Tyrant then with all his fleet In state with honour would him meet. But he to destiny giues way, And as they wild he did obay. Leauing his ship he their skiffe enters, And scorning feare he death aduenters: Wherewith Cornelia headlong flies Into the hostile skiffe likewise, Seeing her husband so gone out Cornelia distasteth Pompeys aduenture.Transported with the carefull doubt That they did plot some villany, And therefore kept him company. Rash woman stay behind (he said) And so to do his sonne he praid; Pompeys perswasion to his wife &amp; sonne.And bids them there aloofe expect Of this aduenture the effect: And well obserue with what faith led They now will entertaine his head. But all in vaine he charmes deafe eares, For now Cornelia, mad with feares, Her hands lifts vp with frighted brow; Cruell, without me, whither now Cornelias words of impatience to Pompey.Meanst thou to goe? must I againe In solitary sort remaine, And reft the company of thee Now from Thessalian dangers free? We wretches neuer sundred are But there ensues some heauy care. Why didst thou not thy sailes diuart, And flye into some other part, And leaue me (wretch) in Lesbos plac't If from all lands I must be chac't. Thy company I cannot please, But onely on the raging seas. When she in vaine had thus complain'd, In doubt her owne ship-side she strain'd. With dread amaz'd her eyes she rold, And did not Pompey then behold. These in the shippes did doubtfull stand The counsaile of Pompeys friends for his landing.Of Pompeys fortune on the land; Not fearing feare or treachery, But doubting that too humbly He would that King for aid entreat To whom he gaue that Regall seate. But as he meant a shore to passe, He suddenly saluted was By one, a Roman souldier, That in a Pharian boate drew neere, Septimius, a Roman souldier, that serued Ptolomy, described. Septimius hight (ô heauenly shame) That he his Countrey should defame One of the guard to Ptolomey As his base weapon did display. His Roman pile was set aside, Fierce, violent, enrag'd with pride: No sauage beast could him exceed For slaughter, or for bloody deed. A man would thinke that Fortune meant That so much blood should not bee spent, Nor yet so many people wrack't, Because the warre his right hand lack't. And that his murdrous sword so farre Was banish't the Pharsalian warre. But Fortune such thou spread'st abroad, That ciuill slaughters might be stroad In euery coast, to bring defame Vnto the victors cruell name. And that thy stories iust complaint Should all the Gods with shame attaint. So did this Roman sword obay The King, and Pompey thou mayst say, This Palean Princox did not dread With thine owne sword to reaue thy head. And future times shall still record Septimius name to be abhord. But with what tearmes to be exprest, If Brutus fact the world detest? Now his last houre approached on, For hee with Pharian barge is gone, And of himselfe the power had lost, The Tyrants monsters him accost With naked swords vpon him bent, And when he saw their vile intent, Pompey couers his face with his cloke when hee saw the traytors presse vpon him.With weapons prest to giue the stroke, Vpon his face he throwes his cloke. Disdaining that his bared head To fortune should be offered. And therwithall he closd his eyes, His spirit he supprest likewise, Pompeys resolution.Because hee would no moanes expresse, Nor teares to make his vertues lesse. But when Achillas (damned wretch) With murdrous glaiue he made a breach Achillas and Septimius doe murder Pompey.Into his side, with gaping wound: Nor sigh nor grone yet did he sound. But manfully the stroke did bide, And onely turn'd his face aside. And from his place he neuer moues, But dying so himselfe approues. And thus resolues within his thought, Who then this villany had wrought. All after times that vs succeedes, And doe record the Romans deedes, This wicked act will not obscure, But whilst the heauen and earth endure To all parts of the world will flye This sippe and Pharian perfidie. But Pompey now thy fame intend, Fate long thee happy life did lend: And didst thou not, by dying, trye The valour that in thee doth lye? How should men know that as thou list Aduersity thou couldst resist? Giue then no way to others shame, Nor yet this actor onely blame. Though others hand thy life hath wrack't, Beleeue it to be Cæsars fact. The Authors bitternesse in taxing Cæsar.Let them my carkasse rent at will, O Gods I shall be famous still! No power this happinesse can rend, Though Fortune bee no more my frend, I am not wretched in my end. My deere Cornelia and my sonne Doe see this slaughter on me done, And therefore Sorrow I thee pray, Shut vp my woes, and all dismay. But if my wife and sonne see this With griefe, their loue the greater is. Such was the fortresse of his minde Thus stout in death he life resign'd. But now Cornelias patience Could not so easily dispence To see this deed on Pompey done, As if her selfe that hap had runne. So as with wretched sighes and cries, She dimmes the aire, and filles the skies. O my deere husband I am she That thus hath bred the wracke of thee, When Lesbos Isle with fatall stay Drew thee so farre out of the way. Then Cæsars plots arriu'd before Thy selfe, on damned Nylus shore. For who else durst take liberty On thee to shew such cruelty? But whosoeuer that thou bee Ordain'd thereto by heauens decree; Or else by Cæsars hest design'd: Or from thine owne corrupted minde, Vpon his head such rage to shew; O cruell! thou dost little know Cornelias complaint for the murdering of Pompey. Where noble Pompeys heart doth rest, Come with thy sword and pierce this breast That vnto him is vowd and bent That more then death would him torment Shew, my head ere his life be spent. I am not guiltlesse of this warre, As other Roman matrons are; For neither I vpon the maine, Nor in the Campe did him refraine. I stucke to him in misery, VVhen Kings did shunne his company. Haue I (O husband) this deeseru'd, In thy safe ship to be preseru'd? A bitter interrogation.Vngratefull man, thou spard'st thy wife! Was I then worthy of my life When death on thee his force would trye? No, I in spight of Kings will dye. O Marriners stay not my veaze, Headlong to plunge into the seas. Or with your hands prepare a twine, That strangle may this throate of mine: Or some one that was Pompeys frend, Cornelia desires to dye.Come with thy sword and my life end. Thou shalt doe that for Pompeys sake, Which Cæsars fury else will take. O cruell wights! why should you giue Me longer life, that loath to liue? But husband mine, thou art not dead, Of my selfe yet I am not head. Of these, my death I cannot craue, The victor must that honour haue. So hauing said, amidst them all Rapt with a trance, shee downe did fall, And thence was borne in mazed plight In her owne shippe, that then tooke flight. But thogh their swords from side to side Had pierc't him through with gashes wide; Hee still retain'd within his face Pompeys sweet aspect after he was slaine, and lay dead.A sweete aspect and reuerent grace: His browes against the Gods hee bent, And when his life was gone and spent, Yet in his lookes, or in his cheare, No change at all there did appeare, As they themselues did make report That saw him murdred in that sort, For cruell hee Septimius, To make his act more odious, His sacred face laid open bare, Septimius vncouers Pompeys face after he was slaine, and hackes off his head.The couering vaile hee rent and tare, And whilst the head yet breathes with sweat Hee takes it vp, and thwart a seat The lithy hanging necke hee puts, And so the veines and sinewes cuts. Then long he hackes the knotty bone, To cut it cleane he Art had none. But with his hewing that he makes, From off the corpes the head he takes. Achillas vseth Septimius basely, and takes the head from him. The which Achillas from him teares, And in his hand it proudly beares. O Roman Souldier, slauish base, That woulds thy selfe so much disgrace To be an vnderling to such. For since thy hand had done so much Vpon that head of so great fame, Thou shouldst thy selfe haue borne the same. O shamefull Fates! this boyish King, When they to him the head did bring, That he might know his manly looke The same in his right hand he tooke, And by the haire he did it hold, Ptolomy viewes Pompeys head, holding it by the haire. Those reuerent lockes now hoary old, That had so many Kings controld, And shadowed his comely brow, This noble head he pitcheth now Vpon a Pharian sharpned stake, Pompeys head borne on a stake by the Ægyptians. Whilst yet with life the cheekes did quake. And whilst with throbs the spirits beat, And ere the eyes were throughly set. So was this honored head abusd, That neuer peace for warre refusd. The Countries lawes, the armed field, And Rostrum did him reuerence yeeld. That noble face, that braue aspect The Romane fortune did affect. But yet this wicked Tyrants heart Pompeys head embalmed, &amp; preserued to be presented Cæsar. Was not suffisd with this vile part, For he desires his villany Might goe beyond his perfidy: And when they cleansd his head and braine, So as no humors should remaine To putrifie, then Art they vse To keepe the face, and balme enfuse. Thou off-spring last degenerate Meaning Cleopatra, Queene of Ægypt, after Ptolomy her brother.Of Lagus line, art neere thy date: For thy incestious sisters hand Shall reaue thy scepter and thy land. Must Pompeys corpes with so great scorne Lye on the sands mangled and torne; And thence be cast from side to side Against the rockes with euery tide? Whilst that thy Macedonian race He inueighs against Ptolomy for not bringing Pompeys body.In sacred sepulchers haue place: And that their ashes quiet rest, With Graues and Monuments possest; And damned ghosts of wicked mood Come from the Ptolomean brood, Be closd in Pyramids of fame, And with Mausolas worthy frame. Was it a worke of so great paine To let the corpes entire remaine, That Cæsar might behold it plaine? Hath Fortune, after all her smiles, Thus Pompey foyl'd with her last guiles? Are all those glories him assignd, Shut vp with death of such a kinde? O cruell dame! must all thy threapes Fall all on him at once in heapes, That neuer earst did feele mis-happe, Pompey neuer vnfortunate but now at his last, after the battaile of Pharsalia.But alwayes dandled in thy lappe? Pompey is hee that this can say Hee neuer yet saw lucky day, Mingled with any crosse dismay. His happy fate without stoppe goes, None of the Gods did it oppose. But when his ruine was decreed, They laid on load, and made quicke speed. Fortune sometimes did him aduance, And by the hand leades him in dance. But now on sands hee lyes ore-flowne, And on the rockes with billowes throwne. And as a scorne in seas is drownd, Where waues make gutters through each wound: No forme in him is to bee found. Pompey hath no marke to be knowne, A strange marke to be knowne by. But that his corps a head hath none. And yet before the Conqueror Arriued on the Pharian shore, Fortune for Pompey tooke some care And did in hast his tombe prepare, Whereby he should not want a graue, Although no fitting buriall haue. For Codrus that there hidden lay, Came fearefully downe to the bay. This man that crept so from his den, Was one of Pompeys haplesse men, And lately made his Treasurer, When they put from the Cyprus shore. He durst come out in darke of night, And loue vnto his feare gaue might. To seeke the body in the maine, Codrus Pompeys seruant entends a funerall fire for his masters body wh? he had found it. To bring it to the land againe, And to the shore his Pompey traine. The Moone a little glimmering lent, Which through the duskie clouds she sent Whereby the body he discouerd, That with a differing colour houered Vpon the waues, that strugling make, When in his armes he did him take, And being tired with the fraight, He hop't the waue would lift the waight. The which it did, and with that aid The corps he to the shore conuaide. And on the land where it lay drie Vpon the body he did lie, And wailing there twixt griefe and feares, He euery wound did fill with teares, And to the Gods and stars in skies, He thus poures out his wofull cries. Thy Pompey doth not of thee craue O Fortune, any glorious graue, Codrus complaint against Fortune, Nor yet that gums of pleasant sent Vpon his funerall be sprent, Nor that the fat his members yeelds, Mixt with the drugs of Easterne fields With orders should perfume that aire, Which smoaking to the skies repaire. Nor that with loue the Romans led, To their deare parent being dead. Should him vpon their shoulders place, His day of funeral to grace. Nor that the pompe of his last date Should all exceed in glorious state. Nor that the court with heauie notes, Should singing straine their wailing throtes. Nor that the armie in a file Should march about the flaming pile, And throw their weapons down the while. Giue Pompey but a common chest, Wherein his bones may safely rest, And that his rent torne lims may burne Together, and to ashes turne. And that I miserable wight, This to performe may want no might, A worthlesse man his fire to light. It is enough ô Gods diuine, That there is wanting at his shrine Cornelia with disheueled tresse, And that she cannot here expresse Poore soule, to him her latest vowes, With deare embracements of her spouse. And on his face her teares deplore, Though farre shee be not from this shore. As soone as he these words had spoke Farre off he spide a fire and smoke, VVhere some base body was a burning, VVithout attendance, or friends mourning. From thence some fire he takes away, And brands that with the body lay. VVho so thou art (quoth he) that heere Neglected burnst, to no man deare, Then Pompey yet thou happier art Be not displeased for thy part, That my last hands do thus beguile, Some portion of thy funerall pile. And if that any sence remaine Codrus makes hard shift for fuell and fire to bury Pompeys body. In mortals that deaths dart hath slaine. Then giue me leaue I thee desire, To take this pittance from thy fire. I shame to see thy Cinders burne, Whilst fire shall want for Pompeys vrne. So said the kindled brands he takes, And for the corpes a fire he makes, Which then the tide had well neare reacht But some part on the strand lay streacht. From it the sands he wipes away, And then together he doth lay The broken fragments of a boate, (With fearefull hand) which there did float In a foule ditch somewhat remote. No heaped stacke of oaken piles, These noble lims did presse the whiles, Vnder the corps no wood was laid, But to this slender flame conuaid A loft the body burning staid. He sitting downe hard by the flame Thus said, O Captaine great of name, Chiefe maiestie of Roman fame. If that the tossing of the seas, And no graue would thee better please Codrus speech to Pompeys ghost whilest the body was burning. Then this poore obsequie of mine, Let thy braue spright and soule diuine, These my endeauours nought esteeme, But iniury of Fate it deeme. That I haue thought this lawfull done, Thereby thy bodies spoiles to shun. From monsters of the raging waues. And from those beasts on flesh that raues, And from the vultures greedy mawes, And from the wrath of Cæsars pawes, Therefore in worth accept of me This last fire that I offer thee, If so it with thy honor stand, Now kindled with a Roman hand, But if that Fortune do recoyle, And bring thy friends to Latium soyle, Thy sacred Cyndars may find grace To be lodg'd in a worthier place, So as Cornelia, Pompeys spouse May yeeld to thee more glorious vowes. And with my helpe that now thee burne, May put thy cinders in an vrne. Meane while to shew where is thy graue, Some litte stone a marke shall haue; Vpon this shore, that if some frend Thy greater honor do intend, And would thy death more eternize, He may know where thy body lies. And to great Pompey here laid dead, He may againe restore the head. Thus hauing said, doth fuell adde To this small fire that burnes so sad. And then the fat that in it fries, Doth cause the flame aloft to rise, And to the fire giue fresh supplies. By this Auroras blushing face, Codrus hauing performed his last office to his maister, hides himselfe againThe glittring stars away did chace. And he poore soule with maze afright, Disorderly breakes of this right, And in a corner shuns the light. Vaine man what feare doth thee distract For thy performance of this act, Whereby vnto all future dayes, Thy fame with honor thou dost raise, Since wicked Cæsar will commend These bones so buried by a frend? Go safely and desire to haue The head likewise to lay in graue. For pietie bids thee not shun, To end this duttie well begun. Then doth he take these bones halfe burnd And members not to ashes turnd, Which he together doth dispose, And in a little pit inclose. Then left the wind the sand should raise Vpon the graue a stone he layes. And that no Marriners should bind Codrus buryes the cinders &amp; layes a stone with an inscription on it. Their Cable where this stone they find About the same, and it displace, Vpon the top he did inchace The sacred name with a burnt brand, Pompey lies buried in this sand. Where Cæsar rather would he lay, Then want his graue or funerall day. But ô rash hand that dost suppose, In such a sepulcher to close Great Pompey and his wandring ghost, That rangeth ouer euery coast, As farre as any land extends, And to the vtmost Oceans ends. The Empire large and name of Rome, The true tipe is of Pompeys tombe. Remoue this stone for very shame, Which to the Gods imputeth blame. If Hercules must needs haue all, Hercules and Bacchustomb Mount Oete for his funerall, And Bacchus must with like accompt Take all Parnassus sacred mount. Why then should one Egyptian stone Suffise for Pompeys tombe alone. All Egypt should stand for his graue, If no stone his inscription haue, We Romans shalbe still in dread, Lest we on Pompeys ashes tread, When we do range about those lands, And doubt to march on Nylus sands. But if so reuerent a name Thou wilt inscribe vpon the same, His noble acts therewith consort, His great atchieuements of import. And there to that rebellious iarre, That he supprest in th' Alpyn warre VVhen as proud Lepidus conspirde A breefe recitall of P?peys noble acts. And how a Consull he retirde, Cald backe when he had put to foyle, Setorrius in his Spanish broyle. When for it he in Triumphs pride, Through Rome with great applause did ride. And how he gaue the world commerce, When he the pirats did disperse. Adde thereunto the nations wonne, And the Barbarians ouerrunne. With whatsoeuer in the East, Or in the Northerne parts did rest, Shew that he euer armes laid downe His conquest done; and tooke the gowne, That thrice he had in Triumphs sate, And gaue great spoyles vnto the state. What graue can this mans worth containe His tombe lies leuell with the plaine. His wretched hearse thou dost not raise With titles equall to his praise, Nor yet those holy orders write, That Roman Callenders recite. Which on the stately pillars stand, Of Gods the Patrons of our land. Nor with those glorious trophees grac't, That are on temples arches plac't. The basenes of Pompeys Tombe.Alas our Pompeys sepulcher, Leuels the Egypt sands so neare, And lies so flat vpon the shore, To reade it men must stooping pore. Which any Roman that goes by, But being told will hardly spy. We were not cautious as we ought Of that Cumana Sybill wrote, Sybilla Cumana her prophetes.Who warn'd vs in all ciuill broyle, To shun the harmes of Egypts soyle, And that no Roman chieftaine should Come neare to Nyles Pelusian mould, But shun that sommer swelling shore. What dismall fate may I implore, Against that cruell land that durst Attempt and act this deed accurst. Let Nylus bacward bend his head And stay whereas his spring is bred Acurse against Egypt And let this parched soile remaine VVithout all helpe of winters raine, And let such burning heates it rost, As fries the Æthiopian coast, Thy Isis Aegypt, for thy sake, We did into Romes temple take; And currish Demigods withall, On whom with Cymbals you do call, Isis the wife of Osiris one of the Egyptian Gods. And thou Osyris whom with plaint, As but a man your selues depaint. But Egypt thou in scorne dost hold Our spirits in base dustie mould, And thy selfe Rome that with such state Didst those braue Temples dedicate Meaning Cæsar, whom they accompted a tyrant for taking such power to him ouer the Empire. Vnto the wicked Tyrants name, Hast not yet ask't, for feare of blame, The ashes of thy Pompey slaine, VVhose ghost doth banisht still remaine. And though at first that fearefull age VVere ouer-awd by Cæsars rage, Yet now take vnto thee at last Thy Pompeys bones, since feare is past. Except that the encroaching maine, Do them and all that shoare detaine. Else who needs doubt his graue to turne, VVith sacred rites to grace his vrne. O would that deed were made my taske, And Rome at my hands would it aske! O happy I and too much blest, The Authors loue to Pompeys merit. Might I remoue that sacred chest And bring the same to rest in Rome, If lawfull tis to force his tombe! But yet ô Pompey it may chance, That if ill seasons dearth aduance, Or that contagious plagues oppresse, Or fearefullfires should Rome distresse, Or earthquakes put vs in a fright, These miseries to banish quite; Vnto the Gods we make request, And thereupon by their behest, Thou maist againe to Rome returne To expiate these with thy vrne. And that the chiefe Priest we shall call To beare thee to thy funerall, But now what passenger goes by Syenen that the heates do frie, Of Cancers parched torryd zoane; Or vnto whom is Nylus knowne, That costs her Thæbas burning sands, Which vnder showring Plyades stands: Or who the red Seas gulffe doth trade, Or trafficks vsing to be made, About the rich Arabian ports, P?peys graue stands in the high way of those that trade fr? many nations.Or else for marchandise consorts, With those that come from Eastern shore, But Pompeys graue he will explore. And seeke to see that reuerent stone That lies his low lodg'd tombe vpon. And turne a side out of the way, To see thy cynders if he may, That on the sands perhaps do stray, And therewithall will take delight To sacrifice vnto thy spright, And will thy worthie name preferre Before the Cassian Iupiter. So as this little paltery shrine, Will more aduance that fame of thine, Then if thou hadst a Tombe of gold, Such as our Temples vse to hold, For here interred lies with thee Romes liberty buried with Pompey.The Fortune of Romes libertie. So as a farre more happie stone, The Lybicke waues shall beate vpon, Then are those Altars to be prisde, Whereon the victor sacrifisde. For those that often are so bold, Their incense offrings to withhold, From the Tarpeian Deities Will shew their loues and charities. Vnto the shrine of thy sweete soule, Here raked vp in this duske hole. Here of the fame of future dayes, More glory vnto thee will raise, The authour meanes here that if Pompy had no t?be at all, &amp; the place of his sepulcher forgott?, that then future ages wold (by considering his acts) thinke he were deified. Then if thy monument were built With stately marbles caru'd and guilt. And that the measure of thy graue, A huger height and scope might haue. For now a little time will chace Thy heaped cinders from this place, When as these sands away shall fall, That couer now thy buriall. And so the knowledge will decay, How thou camst to thy fatall day. Then ages happier will liue, Which will no trust nor credit giue To any, that this stone shall show, The Ægypti?s will obscure this vile treachery from their successors, &amp; report so of Pompey as the Cretans did of Iupiter. Which yet the world so well doth know. But Egypt will disproue this reed, Vnto her children that succeed, And make the Death and Tombe likewise, Of Pompey but such tales and lies, As were those of the Cretan Ile, Whence thundring Ioue doth take his style. Finis libri octaui. The ninth Booke. The Argvment. From Earth great Pompeys blessed spright, Vnto the heauens doth take his flight. Cato the remnants of the host Transports vnto the Lybian cost. Cornelia wailing, grieues and mournes, And Pompeys robes to ashes burnes. Cnæus his sonne reuenge intends: Cato his noble minde commends. The saylers fall to mutinie, Whom Catos speech doth qualifie. About the Syrtes his nauie trades: And Lybia then his hoast inuades. Thence through the wildernesse he trends: And vnto Hamons Temple wends. Cæsar Pharsalia now forsakes, And towards Nyle his iourney takes. Where Pompeys head they him present: The which with teares he doth lament. Bvt yet the soule aloft aspires, Pompeys soule receiued into the lower spheres.And staid not in the Pharian fires. Such flames could not his blessed spright Restraine from their high mounting flight. But from the funerall it flits, And those halfe burned members quits; That base vnworthy tombe it leaues, The thundring vault the same receaues. Whereas the duskie aire confines Next to the orbes that lowest shines; And where the distance spacious Is spread betweene the Moone and vs. Where soules and demi-gods doe dwell, Whose shining vertues did excell: And vpright liues did them prepare, In this low element to share. Whereas his blessed ghost it reares To rest in the eternall spheres. Those come not thither that are plac't In perfum'd tombes beguilt and chac't. And when he was in this faire seate With ioyous perfect light repleat; He viewes the wandring starres in skies, And fixed planets Markes likewise: And sees (in value of that light) Our brightest dayes are but as night. Pompeys soule contemplates the earthly passages. And of those scornes he makes but mirth, That they doe to his Trunke on earth. From hence Emathias field hee eyes, And Cæsars bloody Ensignes spies. Then flittes hee ouer all the maine, Where flotes the sparsed Nauies traine: Then sits in Brutus sacred breast, Where for this guilt reuenge doth rest. And thence hee flittes a place to finde, In worthy Catos dreadlesse minde. He (whilst the strife in doubt depended, And that the question was not ended, Whom this sterne ciuill warre would call To bee the supreame Lord of all) Cato disliked Pompey. Did Pompey hate; although his part He tooke, as fellow in this Mart; Led thereto for his Countries cause, And to obserue the Senates Lawes. But when Pharsalias field was fought, Then Pompeys course did rule his thought: And into his protection takes His countrey, that a guider lacks: Cato takes on him the protection of his comely.And to their fearefull hands affords Weapons againe, that left their swords. But neither seeking soueraigntie, Nor that he fear'd seruilitie, Did he new ciuill warres erect, It was not for his owne respect, But (after Pompey lost his life) For libertie was all their strife. And (lest that Cæsar might inuest Himselfe, of all the troopes distrest By his surprises suddenly, After his gained victorie. They being so disperst in rout Through all the countrey round about) He to Corcyra did resort, And thither to a secret port, He all the scattered fragments led, That from Emathias flaughter fled. A thousand ships he fill'd with these, And thence he put vnto the seas. Who would haue thought the scattred traines That of Pharsalias wracke remaines, Suffisd so many ships to fill? Or that the Seas were stuffed still Cato assembles all the scattred Romans of Pharsalia.With such a fleet, prepar'd for Mart, Belonging to the conquered part, Hence he to Malean Doris goes, And vnto Tenerus, that showes The way to hell, and therewithall, On the Cytherean cost doth fall. And so alongst he leaueth Creete, Catoes Nauie and his nauigation.The Northwind driuing on his fleete. And (vrged by the shrinking tides) Dictæan shores he ouer slides. Thence to Phycunta he resorts, That held his nauie from their ports. But puts that Towne to great distresse, And sackes it, that deseru'd no lesse. Thence did a fitting winde procure Him to thy shore, O Palinure; For thou dost not alone retaine Thy monuments on Latium maine: But Lybia's quiet ports do tell, They pleas'd the Troian Pilot well. Palinurus, Æneas Pilot. Then they aloofe a fleet descride, Which did with doubts their minds diuide; Whether it did consist of foes, Or of the fellowes of their woes. The victors great celerity Still held them in perplexity: And what ships on the seas they see, They still thought Cæsar there to bee. But those poore hulles alas did beare Nothing, but wofull plaints and feare: Yea such as mournfull sobbes might wrest From Stoicke Cato's hardned breast. For after that (with vaine request) Cornelia desires to stay on the Ægyptian coast. Cornelia had her Pilots prest, And son-in-law (that would away) A longer time neere Nyle to stay; Because her husbands Corpes shee thought Might to the weltring waues bee brought By surges of the raging maine, That on the Pharean shore did straine. For proofe whereof shee said withall, His corpes had no right buriall. Of Fortune then (quoth shee) was I So worthlesse that thou shouldst deny Mee meanes, and leaue for to attend My husband at his funerall end? And on the cold limbes of my spouse To stretch my armes with latest vowes? And my torne lockes with him to burne, And place those ashes in an vrne That now the waues doe tosse and turne. And that I might powre floods of teares Into those wounds his body beares? And on my garments cast at once The hot burnt cinders of his bones? And whatsoeuer lawfull were From out his funerall to beare, With my hands might be gathered, In Temples of the Gods to spread? But out alas his funerall No flaming honour had at all; Perhaps some hand of Pharos cost Perform'd that act, griefe to his ghost. O Crassian cinders yee were blest, That still vncouered doe rest! For seeing Pompey had that flame, To bee buried in that treacherous land was a dishonor to Pompey.The Gods repute it greater blame. Shall my hard destiny still finde Such dismall woes to vex my minde? Shall neuer I the fortune haue To lay my husbands in a graue? Nor present be when as they dye, To fill their vrnes with flowing eye? But what need I seeke them a graue, Or instruments (O griefe) to craue? Vaine woman, doth not Pompey rest Intombed in thy faithfull breast? Doth not his image fixt remaine In thy grieu'd soule, and euery vaine? Let after ages then (for me) Seeke where his cinders scattred be. Yet now me seemes I see his fire With a malignant flame aspire. And something dazles in mine eyes, That from the Pharian shore doth rise, That to thee (Pompey) doth pertaine, And now that flame is out againe; The land where Pompey is interred, deerer to Cornelia then any other land.And yeelds a smoake that Pompey beares In vapours to the Easterne spheres. Whilst spitefull windes do me betray, And beares our sailes another way. No lands by Pompey conquered, Nor where his triumphes Carres were led Alongst the streetes (with glorious bayes) To the high Capitolean wayes, More deere to me (since reft my breast) Then Pharian sands where he doth rest. Tis Pompey I would haue so faine, Whom Nylus doth from me detaine. And that makes me not loath to stay Longer, within this wicked bay. The heynous fact that I deplore, Is that, that now adornes this shore. If euer I did Pompey loue, I would not from this coast remoue. Cornelia perswades Sextus to Armes. Do thou (O Sextus) warres pursue, And ouer all the world renew The Ensignes of thy famous sire: Such was his will and his desire, That he in charge to me did giue; Which words within my soule still liue, Pronounced with his latest breath, The houre that queld me with his death. My sonnes, see that you vndergoe Cornelia deliuers Pompeys words and charge to his sonnes. This ciuill warre against our foe, Whilst any of our name or birth Remaines aliue vpon the earth, Admit not Cæsars tyranny, Moue states that stand for liberty, And mighty Townes that doe the same, And him resist with glorious fame. These parts to you I recommend: These Armes I would you should entend. Which of my sonnes the seas likes best, Shall finde a Nauy ready prest. My heire likewise (in following Mart) Shall Nations finde to take his part. Onely remember that you beare True noble mindes deuoyd of feare. And know tis fit that you obay Onely to Cato, if he sway For liberty, and hold that way. O Pompey! thus doe I discarge Thy trust, and tell thy will at large. But thy deceits haue done me wrong, Forsaken thus, I liue too long: And yet will not with perfidy Forbeare thy words to testifie. But now deere spouse, where so thou be, Here he speaks according to the opinion of Seneca, with whom hee was brought vp.I am resolu'd to follow thee To Chaos vast, and vnto hell (If such there bee, as old sawes tell) But yet to me it is vnsure How long this life of mine shall dure. And therefore anguish shall preuent My liuing soule, from my soule sent. And since to death it could not flye, When (Pompey) it thy wounds did eye, With griefe and wailings shee shall dye. In bitter teares she shall be drownd, The sword shall not our dayes confound, No strangling halter will I trye, Nor head-long breake-necke from an hye: For me twere base to want the might By sorrowes straine to leaue this light. So hauing said, her noble head With a blacke vaile she ouer-spred: Cornelias solitary griefes.And then retires her to the darke In hollow cauernes of the barke. And there vnto her selfe enioyes Her restlesse teares, and griefes annoyes; And onely (in her husbands place) Doth woes and wofull plaints embrace. Shee scornes the raging seas and clouds, And Eurus whistling in the shrowds, And cries that Mariners doe make, When they with dreadfull dangers quake. To theirs she makes contrary vowes: Resolu'd to dye, she stormes allowes. Her ship first seiz'd the Cyprus shores, Whereas the thundring billowes rores. And then to sea they put anew, With Easterne winde that calmer blew. And lighted on the Lybicke Land, Cornelias fleete arriues on Lybia, where Cato was incamped Where that time Cato's Campe did stand. Then wofull Cnæus did espy His countrey fellowes, proaching nye The Affricke coast, and as those mindes That dread afflicts, presages findes; When he his brother Sextus saw, Neere to the seas strand he doth draw, And head-long wades into the maine. Cnæus Pompeius words to his brother Sextus Deere brother now to me explaine Where is our Sire, and in what plight Stands our affaires? are we of might As yet, or else abandon'd quite? Hath Pompey Romes last fortune tride? So said, his brother thus replide. O happy thou whom Fortune guided Sextus answere to his brother. To other coasts, from vs diuided! Thou onely miseries shalt heare, Whereof mine eyes the witnesse were When on the sword our father dide, Though Cæsars hand he hath not tride. The Author of his funerall Deserues by ruines rage to fall. With that vile King, that in his hands Doth hold the fruitfull Nylus lands. He hop't some due respects to finde Of Hospitatious friendly kinde; For many fauours of his loue That this Kings ancestors did proue. But (for requitall of that Realme) As sacrifice his blood they streame. Whilst I alas beheld (with paine) Our noble Father by them slaine. Whereas I thought that Pharian King Durst not attempt so foule a thing. But did presume that Nylus land Would loyally vnto him stand. But neither me, the old mans wounds, Nor his shed bloud so much confounds, As when we saw his head forlorne, Throughout the traytors Citty borne, Fixt on a lofty pole in scorne. And now tis kept (by fames report) The wicked victors eyes to sport. And so the tyrant feedes his minde For this foule fact high grace to finde. But whether that the Pharian dogges, The rauenous foules, or filthy hogges, Haue with the body fild their maw? Or whether that the fire we saw To cinders did the same conuart, I doe not know? but for my part I say, what euer fatall scorne Those worthy limbes away haue borne; The blame vnto the Gods I giue, But his kept head me most doth grieue. When Cnæus heard this heauy newes, He did not then his griefes infuse With childish teares, nor idle plaint, But with iust piety attaint Inrag'd, thus speakes with words not faint. Cnæus reply, &amp; speeches of reuenge for his father so murdred.Yee mariners, with haste lay hands To draw your ships from these dry sands, And with your oares, (without a saile) Against the aduerse windes preuaile. Braue leaders now come follow me, No ciuill warre can iuster be; Nor so great praise as to interre Their naked ghosts, that wandring erre. This tyrant boyes blood must suffise Great Pompeys ghost for sacrifice. Shall I his Pelean Towres not drowne, And all those monuments throw downe, That ouer Alexander stands In Mareotis foggy sands? And raze to ground the Pyramis, Their monument of Amasis? And make all those their buried Kings To swim in midst of Nylus springs? They all shall want and naked lye, (Pompey) thy Tombe to edifie. Isis shall now bee rap't with fire, Whose God-head Nations do admire. And their Osyris (clad in vaile Of linnen) common slaues shall traile. And Apis, their Bull-god, I'le burne A sacrifice to Pompeys vrne. Vnder his head these Gods shall lye Wherewith the funerall shall frye. These wrackes that wretched land shall taste: Their fruitfull fields I will lay waste, None left to plow, to digge or plant, For Nylus to relieue their want. None shall subsist, nor her gifts take, Depopulate I will her make. Thou onely Pompey, and thy graue, That Kingdome to thy selfe shalt haue, When all their Gods away are chac't. Thus said, the Nauy then in hast Prepares it selfe vnto the seas; But Cato did the wrath appease Cato appeaseth the wrath of yong Cnæus. Of this braue youth; yet in the end His noble spirit did commend. Meane while through all the cost is spred The bruit of Pompey murdered. And therewithall a grieuous shout Of cries, did flye the aire about. No griefe did like example show: For neuer any age did know The great lamentations of the people for Pompey. The people to such plaints to fall, For any great mans death at all. But more, for as Cornelia went Out of her ship to make discent Her visage worne, and wast with teares, And dangling tresse about her eares, A doubled shout the people reares. No sooner was she set a land, Whereas the shore was next at hand: But Pompeys robes she gets together, Cornelias great piety towards PompeyHis Ensignes, and else whatsoeuer Of Armes, or like abiliments, And all such glorious ornaments (Richly imbrodered all with gold) As he was wont to weare of old. Then (three times casting vp her eyes Vnto the heauens, and starry skies) All this together she did cast Into a funerall fire at last. These cinders she (poore soule) did make The which she kept for Pompeys sake, Whereby the rest example take. For presently, throughout the shore, Of sacred fires were made huge store: Which they vnto those ghosts did yeeld Late slaine in the Pharsalian field. Such flames doe the Apulians raise When as the frosty winter daies Their fields of greene grasse hath depriu'd; The custome of some countries in burning their lands to make them fruitfulAnd with such heate is new reuiu'd. So the Gargarians vse their grounds. So Vulturs vales with corne abounds. And luke-warme Matyns vse like slight, With boxen bushes flaming bright. Nothing was done in all the host More gratefull vnto Pompeys ghost, (Although for him the heauens they blame, And to the Gods vpbraid his name) Then were the words Cato exprest, Proceeding from a spotlesse brest. Catos Oration in the praise of Pompey.A Citizen (quoth he) is queld, That others heretofore exceld For skill in scanning of the lawes; But in this age for Iustice cause He profited the Roman state: His reuerence chased dire debate. Freedome he aw'd not with his might, But euermore subscrib'd to right. In priuate sort he actions swayd, Although the people him obay'd. And though the Senate hee directed, Yet to their power himselfe subiected: By armed force hee nought effected. What to obtaine his heart was bent, To bee deny'd he was content. Great wealth and honor's he possest; But did the state with more invest. Though to his sword they gaue renowne, Yet knew hee when to lay it downe. Hee Armes beyond the Gowne approu'd, Yet na'thlesse Armed peace hee lou'd. Hee Armies willingly receaues, And all as willingly them leaues. A ciuill house from ryot free, No fortunes gain'd by briberie. With forraine Nations hee had fame, Who reu'renced his noble name. And in like grace at home hee stood, For seruice to his Countries good. The constant course of liberty Was subiect to seruility, When they receiu'd in Rome againe The Marian and the Syllan traine. So, seeing Pompey is bereft No shew of freedome now is left. Men doe not blush at tyranny: No colour now of Empery: None weigh the Senates Maiesty. O happy Pompey to be dead As soone as thou wert conquered! And that the Pharian guilt thee brought That sword, which else thou must haue sought If not thou mightst haue liu'd perchance Vnder proud Cæsars gouernance. To dare to dye is high grace gain'd, And next to that, to be constrain'd. But if that Fortune so betide, We must be thralles to tyrants pride. Then Fortune grant, that Iuba bee Another Ptolomey to mee. What need I feare my foe to serue, When death can me from that preserue? These words did greater glory raise In all mens eares to Pompeys praise, Then if the Theaters had sounded With plaudits, ecchos that rebounded: Whereby the honor of his end Did to his gentle soule ascend. But now the people mutter rumors, And fall into discordant humors. For warres and Armes they doe detest: Since Pompey in his graue did rest, And Tarchon then did vndertake Catos new Ensignes to forsake. He with the shipping suddenly That vtmost rode, away did flye: Whom Cato thus did vilefie. Catos words to Tarchon a Seaman.O greedy Cilix most vntrue, Wilt thou the seas go scoure anew, Now Pompey is by fortune slaine? Must thou turne Pirate once againe? Then of them all he takes a view, That mutin'd in this rogish crew: Mongst whom one lad did courage take, And to the chiefetaine boldly spake. The oration of one of the seamen to Cato. Cato (quoth he) discharge vs now, Our faith to Pompey we did vow: For his sake we did take vp Armes, And not for loue of ciuill harmes. In his behalfe we did our parts; But he is dead that held our hearts. He whom the world lou'd more then peace, With whom our cause of warre doth cease. Permit vs now to leaue to roame To see our houshold Gods at home, That we so long time haue forborne, And our sweet children thus forlorne. For what date shall this warre vs yeeld, If that Pharsalias bloody field, Nor Pompes death can giue it end, Our liues in endlesse toyle we spend. Let vs goe quiet to our graue: Let age his fitting funerall haue. For ciuill warres can scarce affoord A Sepulcher to any Lord. We conquerd men are not to fight Against the great Barbarian might. Fortune doth not our state prouoke With Scithian or Armenian yoke. I serue a gowned Citizen, Vnder his law free Denizen. Who Pompey liuing seconded, To me is first, now Pompeys dead. Meaning Cæsar. To Pompeys sacred worthy spright I will performe all reuerend right; But to his soueraigne power I yeeld, That conquerd at Pharsalias field. Thou Pompey, my sole Captaine wert, I followed onely thee in Mart. Now will I follow Destinie: And yet, to finde prosperity, I neither may, nor will I hope: Since Cæsars fortune swayes the scope. His conquest quaild Æmathian swords, Who to vs captiues helpe affoords. He onely in the world subsists, That will and may (euen as he lists.) Rue on poore vanquisht men in griefe, And vnto wretches yeeld reliefe. All hope in ciuill warre is vaine, Since Ægypts sword hath Pompey slaine. Who liuing, carried vs with loue; But if the publique cause do moue Cæsar was then Consull. Thee Cato, and thy Countries stay; Let vs these ensignes then obay, That Roman Consull doth display. So said, his ship he doth ascend, And swarmes of youths do him attend. Thus Romes affaires did seeme to end. For all, that loued seruile bands Did mutine there vpon the sands. When Cato (from his sacred breast) In these words his free minde exprest. Catos answere to the mutinous marinersIt seemes you then indiffrent were, On whether side you Armes did beare. You were at first for Pompeys part, For Rome you did not wage your mart. And so you doe desire it still, To haue one Lord to rule at will. You did not tyranny oppose: You car'd not your free state to lose. The Senate you refuse to serue; Neither recke you well to deserue Of any side to end this strife, Meaning that Pompey beeing dead, if they were victors, there remained none to tyranize.But would in Idle spend your life. Now safer tis our cause to gaine, You basely would the warres refraine. And now (devoyd of true respect) Your owne free neckes to yokes subiect) And cannot liue without a King Not now, when as a worthier thing Calles men to hazard of the warre; Your swords and persons you debar For Raman freedome to be vsd, Which Pompey mought perchance refusd, And for himselfe your bloods abusd. Meaning Crassus, Pompey and Cæsar.Fortune almost hath tyrants reft, Of three Lords now but one is left. The Parthian bow, and Nylus shore For our free lawes haue done the more. Goe you degenerate, exceed The Ptolemeian guift and deed. Who else will thinke that euer you In these warres did your hands embrue? But rather prone to turne your backes, And first that fled Emathias wrackes. Go safe, for you doe well deserue That Cæsar should your liues preserue. Hee needs must take of you remorse, Subdued nor by siege nor force. O sercile race vnworthy most! Now (that you haue one Tirant lost) A disdainfull manner of speech that Cato vsed to the reuolting Seamen. His successor you will accost. You should no greater grace aspire, Then life and pardon for your hire. And Pompeys wofull wife conuay Into your ships, beare her away. (Metellus child) a noble pray. And liuing sonnes of Pompey breed. Striue Egypts present to exceed, Then take my head with you likewise, So odious to the tyrants eyes. He shall no meane reward receaue, That Catos head will so bequeaue. And know you all tis worth your paine, To follow me my head to gaine. Proceed you therefore and be bold, To purchase grace let blood be sold. Barely to run away were base. So said, his words then tooke such place, That all the Pirats (in such sort) Brought backe the ships into the port, From out the Seas, as Bees do vse, An apt comparison of Bees. When they the waxen hiue refuse. Where they haue made their honny combes, And ranging leaue their little homes. Not mindfull now in swarmes to flie: But each one his owne way doth hie. Not setled yet to sucke and smell The bitter Thyme, they loue so well. When suddenly the tingling sounds Of Phrygian kettles them confounds With maze, they stop their sudden flight: And backe returning, all do light Vpon their hiues, where with their skill Their flowring labours they distill, And combes with blessed honny fill. At whose returne the clownish royle Is glad to see them in his soyle: And on Hyblean grasse to swarme; The treasure of his little farme. Euen so did Catos powerfull words, Vnto iust warre draw on their swords. And their loose minds, whom pleasure feeds, He then recals to martiall deeds, And patiently warres brunt to beare With industrie and free from feare. And first of all vpon the sands, He traines and drawes them out in bands. Then next to that they do inuest Cyrenas wals and it possest. And though that towne had him refusde: Yet he on them no rigor vsd. For Cato no reuenge would take, To conquer did his anger slake. Thence he his speedie march designes To Iubas kingdome, whose confines Confront the Mauritanian lands. But that the Syrts his course withstands Amidst his way; although he thought All difficulties might be brought A digression from the matter to the nature of the Syrtes.To passe, by vertues dantlesse prowes. When nature did at first dispose These Syrts, and shapt their figure out; She left it to the world in doubt, Whether it should be land or seas, For vtterly it doth not please, To sinke it selfe beneath the maine: Nor yet the land can so restraine The waues, but they will haue a share, And such a dangerous place prepare; That there to trauell none shall dare. For here the Sea doth channels straine, And there the lands do rise againe. Here is a long stretcht tracke of shore, And there the swallowing whirlepooles rore. So nature wretchedly designde This portion of her proper kinde, Vnto no vse, or else of old Those Syrts more waues in them did hold And with the Seas were ouer rowld. But that attractiue Titans beames (Feeding vpon the ocean streames, That to the torrid zone were nie) Some of the weltring waues did drie. And yet the Ocean in despight Resisteth Phœbus parching might. But yet his beames (as they draw neare) And wearing time those seas will cleare, And make the Syrts firme land appeare. For scarcely now a little boate Can on the superficies flote, Of those drown'd sands where water stayes, And more and more that sea decayes. As soone as by the helpe of oares, The fleet was gotten from the shores Into the deepes, with all their fraight, The blacke Southwind blowing a haight Out of his region stormy gales, Farre from her course the nauie hales. The description of a cruell tempest on the Seas. And with huge tempests that he sends, Those seas attempted now defends. Farre from the Syrts the waues he beates, Against the cliffes the billow freates. And all the ships that sailes did beare, The tempest from the yards did teare. In vaine the tackling and the shrouds, Their sailes deny'd to those fierce clouds. But ouer boord away are borne, Fluttering at large their ships they scorne. And if that any sayler stout Vnto the yards do goe about To fixe the sailes with cordage fast, He's borne away with whirlwind blast, And from the naked yard is cast. But all those ships found better chance, That in the lofty billows dance. And still aloofe their course did keepe Amidst the channels in the deepe. And by the boord did cut their masts, Lesse subiect thereby to the blasts. So as the tides had power on them, And in despight with force did stemme The puffing windes full in the mouth, And bare those vessels to the South. The other ships the water failes, Their Keeles vpon those hye sands trayles, That lifts it selfe aboue the flood, So as in doubtfull state they stood. The shelfe the one part doth detaine, The other part hangs in the maine. And as the billowes comes more thicke, The faster in the sholes they sticke. For though the forcing Southerne racke Rowles one waue on anothers backe: Yet all those waues could not suffise To drench the shelfe where it did rise. This hugy heape of cluttered sand Vncouered now lay farre from land, And higher vnto sight was rear'd Then Neptunes rugged backe appear'd. The wretched Saylers there are grounded: The ships vpon the shelfe confounded So farre, that they no shore can spye, And in the seas thus beating lye. Yet of this fleet the greater part (With bitter stirrage) got the start Of these, and safely scap't away, Taking their best course as it lay, With skilfull Pilots that did know The coasts, and where the channels goe. And so at length by chance they light A Riuer in Affricke.On that slow streame thats Tryton hight. That God (as old reports do tell) Which with his ringing Trumpe of shell Makes all the maine his sound to heare With windy notes so shrill and cleare, Tryton, Neptunes Trumperer.Of riuers all loues this most deare. And Pallas like esteeme did make That of Ioues braine her birth did take. For that same Lybian Region Was first land that she trode vpon. And is vnto the heauens most neare: As by his heates it doth appeare. In whose smooth waters christall shine She then did see her face diuine. And there her plants she did dispose, And to her selfe the name she chose Of Trytonesse, where this streame flowes. Neare which (as fame reports) likewise, The silent Læthe doth arise: The riuer Læthe. That with infernall veines is fed: By which forgetfulnesse is bred. Here also was conioyn'd to these, The garden of Hesperides: Despoiled of her leaues so bright, Kept by the waking Dragons might. That man is spitefull of condition, That will detract from old tradition. Or call the Poets to accompt For ought which may the truth surmount. This golden groue of treasures store, (Whose boughs such shining apples bore) A troope of virgins guarded still, Whose glistring streames the aire did fill. And that foule Serpents charge to keepe, The fable of Hercules that tooke away the golden Apples from the gard? Hesperides Whose eyes are aye debard of sleepe. And with his taile the trunks infold, That stoope with ouerwaight of gold. But great Alcydes tooke away From these rich trees the pretious pray. And did those shining apples bring To Euristæus Argiues king. The nauie (so cast on this caost, And from the Syrts so clearely tost) Past not as yet beyond the shore Of Garamants, where as they more. But Sextus with his troops staid there, Where Affricks climes more pleasant were. Though Catos valor brooks no stay: But with his cohorts takes his way, Through coasts vnknown where dangers lay. His confidence in armes did stand, And circuits all the Syrts by land. And this the winters wroth perswades, That then did barre those seas of trades. Besides, the fires of Phœbus rayes The falling showres then much allayes. So as his iourney he might hold, Neither opprest with heate nor cold. For where the flaming heate did rage, The dewy season doth asswage. So through the barren sands he venters, And vsd this speech before he enters. O ye that with one common will, Catos oration to his souldiers before hee takes his iourney into the desarts of Lybia.(Dauntlesse to hold your freedome still) Do follow me with such content, Let now your minds be wholy bent To vndergoe this valours taske, That toyle and constancy doth aske. We goe into the barren fields, Of clymats scorcht, that nothing yeelds. Where Tytan parcheth all the ground, And fountaines rarely to be found. Whereas the lands in plenty brings Forth serpents with their poysnous stings. A iourney that with horror rings. Let therefore those (whom deare loue drawes To freedome, and his Countries cause) March on through Lybia with mee, And search out wayes that waylesse bee. If so be they haue no desire To leaue our Ensignes, and retire; But are resolu'd for vertues hire. For it is no part of my minde Mens eyes with fallacies to blinde: Nor yet the Souldiers hearts to cheere, By cloking dangers that draw neere. For I of such mates must bee sped, That freely are by dangers led, By such as Roman worth esteeme, And hardest haps, the brauest deeme, That can indure the toyles of Mart, Whilst I a witnesse share my part. But for that souldier that shall need One to assure him happy speed, And holds his life at so deare rate, That he will euery doubt debate; Let him another leader seeke, And finde a way he more may leeke; Before that I do take in hand This iourney through this parched sand, And march vpon this dustie land. And let these parching heates first light On me, with all their fierie might. And let the Serpents me assaile With poysned teeth, and venom'd taile. Let all those perils (that you dread) Be tried first vpon my head. Let him, that sees that I am drie, Refresh himselfe as well as I. Or that the wooddy shades I seeke: Let him (then panting) do the like. Or sees that I a horsebacke ride, And so my troops of footmen guide: Let him likewise for ease prouide. Or if (as chiefetaine) I doe craue Any prerogatiue to haue Before the souldier vnder me, But cheeke by cheeke his mate wilbe: These drouths, these thirsts, these snakes, these sands Chiefely with valors liking stands. Patience takes ioy in bitter bands. A worthy act holdes greatest state, When it is bought at dearest rate. And Lybias clime such store doth yeeld Of miseries in euery field, As that it may (without defame) Become braue men to shun the same, So he these souldiers fearefull sprites To valarous attempts encites. And to the loue of Martiall broiles In desert paths he wandring toiles. Through endlesse wayes a passage made, He doth the Lybian coast inuade. Cato enters the deserts of Lybia.So dreadlesse Cato (in short date) Lights on a place to close his fate. Whereas a slender tombe shall shrine (Within her wombe) his name diuine. The third part of this massie round (If we beleeue what fame doth sound) Is Affrica; but if we take The same, as heauen and winds do make, Of Europe then it is a share. For Nylus shores no further are From Gades (as first it was a land) Then Scythian Tanais doth stand. And whereas Europe is descyded From Lybs, it was by sea deuided. But Asia did Europa passe, And in his circuit greater was. So whilst these two do iointly send South-westerne blasts, that Noth-east tend, Asia alone (on lefter hand) Coniynd to Boreas chilly land: And on the right to that South streame, The confines of Egyptian realme; From these two limits is possest Of all the title of the East, The parts of Lybia chiefe and best, Enclining is vnto the West. And yet no fountains there are found, And seldome showres to moist the ground, That from the Artick clime proceeds. Yet our dry winds their moisture breeds. That mould in it no wealth doth hold, Either of brasse, or yet of gold. No wicked mines therein haue birth: But all the soyle is sollid earth. In Mauritania trees do grow, Whose worth the people did not know. But to themselues contentment giue, Vnder the Cytrons shade to liue. Our axes since these woods haue feld, Mauritania &amp; the manner of that nation. That meerely were vnknowne to eld. And from the worlds remotest side, We brought our luxurie and pride. But all the coasts both neare and farre, (That with the Syrts inuiron'd are) With too much heate are ouer-run, And parched with the neighbor Sun. As that their graine it doth destroy, And all their Vines the dust doth cloy. No moistned roote the same doth feed, Nor vitall temper it will breed. The Gods that soile do not respect, And nature (stupid with neglect) That land of comfort doth depriue. Those dead sands no spring can reuiue. And yet in this dull barren ground Rare herbs and plants are often found, The which the Nasamons finde out, The Nasmons that liue vpon sea wracks. And gather vp; a people stout That naked are, and those coasts keepes, Which frontiers all alongst the deepes; And with the wracke themselues do nourish, Of ships, that on the Syrts do perish: For alwaies they in waite do stand For pillage on the Ocean sand, When as the ships cannot attaine The port, their wealth, and spoyle they gaine. So as these Nasmons hold commerce, And trade with all the Vniuerse. (In manner of Barbarian kinde) By wracks that on their shore they finde. This wretched way Cato seekes out, There to lead on with courage stout, And there his souldiers to inure, More stormes then on the seas endure. For that the Syrts southwinds do cause Vpon those sands most harmefull flawes. For there no Lybian mounts suffise To stay the furie that doth rise. Nor yet the rocks their force asswage, But in the aire those whirlewinds rage. Amongst the woods they do not fall, Rooting vp hugie trees withall: But flie alongst the parched plaine, (Without resist) with might and maine, And on the sands their rage bestowes, The which it violently blowes. And neuer is alaid againe With any clouds of showring raine. But sweeps in heapes the sands on hie, Which hang and doe not scattring flie. The wretched Nasmons thus behold Their kingdome still with tempests rowld, Their houses to the earth downe throwne, Their roofs (with whirlewinds fury blowne From off their Garamantine frames) To wring as high as hugest flames. And as the smokes ascention Vnto the middle region, Which darkenesse to the day procures, So clouds of dust the aire obscures, The Roman troops began to finde The outrage of this whirling wind, More furiously them to assaile: The furious effects of the Lybian winds.So as their footing did them faile. For euen the very sands did fleete, And slip from vnderneath their feete. The earths foundation it had rac't, And from his proper seate displac't. If that these winds had made their birth Within the Cauerns of the Earth, And crept into the hollow docks, That are surcharg'd with Lybias rocks, But for because the flitting sand, Doth not the forcing wind withstand, Nor make resistance with firme ground, The soyles foundation did stand sound. And that which fled before the winde, Were vpper sands, loose, vncombinde. But there withall so forciblie, The violent blasts amongst them flie, As that from them it takes and teares Their swords, their casks, their shields, and speares, And through the vacant aire them beares. The which to other coasts might seeme: A prodigy of streaming esteeme. As though those armes from heauen did fall, To terrifie the world withall. And that which from mens hands was hent, The Gods downe to the earth had sent. Surely those armes fell in such wise, Whilst Numa was in sacrifise, The which (in a religious feare) The chiefe Patrician youths did weare. So now their armes our souldiers lost, By South or Northerne tempest tost. In this sort all our Romane troopes (Scar'd with these winds) down prostrate droops: Fearing the rapture of each blast, Their garments they gird to them fast. The perils of the Lybian sands. And thrust their hands into the mould. Their own weight seru'd not them to hould. But they were forc't all helps to proue: And yet the winds would them remoue. And therewithall orewhelm'd be they, With heapes of sands whereas they lay. Which dust on them so heauie lies, That they scarce able were to rise, But sticke fast in the heaped sand. And when they get vpright to stand, The same so thicke about them flotes, That they stand buried to the throates. Stones from the wals are taken out, And through the aire are borne about, And cast farre off (most strange to see) Whose fals to many harmfull bee. And where no houses can be found, Huge ruins lie vpon the ground. Men trauel on land by the helpe of the stars as on the Seas.There did appeare no way nor path, The soile at all no difference hath. But as vpon the seas you saile, So must the stars your course auaile, And by them seeke to finde your way. And yet starres do not still display In circuite of the Lybian skies: For many shine not to their eyes, But vnder their horizon lies. Now when the heates had nere appeasd The winds, whose rage the aire had ceasd: And that the daies more feruent grew, And did more scorching beames renew; Through such a countrey then they passe, As by the Gods designed was Of mortall wights to be vnknowne: Plac't vnderneath the torrid zoane. Where noght is found but parching drouth, All moisture tending to the South. Their lims and ioynts in sweat do melt, Their mouths and iawes with thirst do swelt. Yet heare a little vaine they spie, Of putred water running by. The which the souldiers scarce could get, So did the sands the current let. But yet out of the pudled spring A souldier brings Cato water in his helmet.One fils his Caske, and doth it bring To Cato (Chieftaine of the hoast) When all with drought were then embost. Who first a little say did take, And then in anger thus bespake. Thou souldier base, what dost thou see, That is of so small worth in mee? That I alone (of of all this troope) For want of continence should droope? Haue I of nycenesse shewd such signe, That I should first at thirst repine? Nay thou that blame dost more deserue, That drinkst whilst all for thirst do sterue. Therewith he ouer-turn'd the Caske: Catos continencie. So did Alexander. All were suffisd, none water aske. Then they vnto that Temple came, That serues for all the Libian name: And where rude Garamants doe dwell, They haue no other sacred Cell. And here (as old report doth runne) The horned Iupiter doth wonne. But thunder-bolts he none doth beare: Nor is like Latiums Iupiter. With wretched hornes his head is dight; And Ammon Iupiter he hight. The Lybians this Temple hold, Endowed not with gifts nor gold; Nor Iewels of the Easterne morne (with glistering) did this place adorne. And yet the Æthiopians, And all the rich Arabians, With those in India that liue, To Ammon onely God-head giue. Yet for a God he is but bare, In no age he for wealth had care. His Temple he from that restraines, Vnviolate with greedy gaines. And (as it was the ancient guise) That God-head did the gold despise That in the Roman Temples lies. And that same place doth witnesse well, That there some heauenly powers do dwell. For onely there is to be seene, That Lybian soyle doth bring forth greene. For all the rest of parched sands, Diuided from the temperate lands Of Berenice, and Leptis ground, Berennicis and Leptis two Cities. Nor grasse nor leafe is to be found. Ammon alone greene groues retaines, And those are causd by springing vaines, Which in that place the earth refines, And with those springs the sands combines. Here nothing doth withstand the Sunne When he his highest pitch doth runne, In equalling their nights and dayes: A relation how the signes and poles doe lye to those parts of Lybia.For then the boughes scarce shade displayes Vpon the body of the tree, The sunny beames so shortned bee; By reason that they downe-right strike, And therefore cause no shade oblike. And this is thought to be the place Whereas the Sunnes high circling race Doth cut the line that beares the Signes, In middle where the Solstice shines. For then they go no whit a scance, Nor Taurus righter doth aduance, Then Scorpio, in his sphericke dance: Nor Aries doth prescribe the times To Libra, when his height he climes. Nor yet Astræa doth require Slow Pisces downe-ward to retire. Chyron the Centaure equally Is opposite to Gemini: And moistie Capricorne the same In distance, as is Cancers flame. Nor Leo (with his fiery eyes) Doth higher then Aquarius rise. But vnto thee, who so thou art Of any Nation, that apart Is sequestred from Lybian beames, The shadow euer South-ward streames; But contrary with Northerne Realmes. Thy sight the North-starre vndergoes, And Vrsa Maior to thee showes; As if that all his vnwet waine Were ouer-whelmed in the maine. And each starre, that is most of light, Seemes (by the sea) hid from thy sight: And either Pole this Region Makes equall with thy Horizon; Where all the Signes (in their swift force) In midst of heauen do run their course. Before this Temple gate did stand The people of the Easterne land, Attending there to know their fates, Which Ammons Oracle relates. But yet to Cato all gaue way; And his owne Captaines doe him pray, That of this God he would explore (Whom Lybia did so much adore) His doome, what fortunes and what chance The future Ages should aduance. And he that Cato most importunes, To search the knowledge of their fortunes, And counsell of this God to take, Was Labienus, that thus spake: Labienus speech to Cato. The happe and fortune of our way Hath offered vs this lucky day, To learne from this high power diuine, Of our successe the fatall fine. For by so great a guide as he, We may a right directed be Through Syrts, in wandring neare and farre: And know the chances of this warre. For vnto whom should I beleeue The heauenly powers would sooner giue True knowledge of their secret hest, Then vnto Cato's holy breast? For thy iust life God hath respected, And beene by lawes diuine directed; And vnto thee tis granted still With Ioue himselfe to speake at will. Enquire of wicked Cæsars fate, And what shall be our Countries state. Whether the people shall retaine Their lawes, and liberties againe; Or ciuill warre shall vs still straine? Fill now thy breast with sacred voyce, Thou that in vertue dost reioyce; Learne what our valour may atchiue, And how our honest course may thriue. He (alwayes fild with grace diuine, That in his secret soule did shrine) These worthy speeches from his heart (Like Oracles) doth now impart. O Labienus to me show, What thou woldst I should seek to know. Where I in Armes had rather dye, Or liue a slaue to tyranny. Whether we may a life it call, That is not dated long withall? Where diffring age doe oft auaile, Where rigor can true goodnesse quaile? Where fortune doe her threats but loose, When she doth vertues might oppose? Whether that it may vs suffice Praise-worthy deeds to enterprise? And whether that it be successe Makes honest actions more or lesse? This we already know as well Catos diuine conceits. As Ammon can the same vs tell. Vpon the Gods we all depend; And though this Temple had an end, Yet otherwise nought can succeed, But by Gods ordinance decreed. His mighty power no voyce doth need. The Author of all mortall kinde, Hath once for all declar'd his minde, Our knowledge is by him confin'd. These barren sands are not his choyce, Where he will vtter forth his voyce. Nor in this dust doth hee conceale Those truthes, that he meanes to reueale. The sacred seates of God are these, The Heauens, the Aire, the Earth, the Seas, And vertues selfe; why should wee proue To search beyond the Gods aboue? What so thou seest, where so thou art Of Iupiter himselfe is part. Let faithlesse minds these witch-crafts need, And such as dread what shall succeed. No Oracles can me secure, But death it selfe that is most sure. The Coward, and the valiant Knight Must fall at last, and leaue this light. And now for all may vs suffice, That Ioue himselfe speakes in this wise. So hauing said, with faiths repose, The Temples Altars he forgoes; And Ammons counsell doth disdaine, Leauing it to those people vaine. Then in his hand he takes his pile, And march't a foot himselfe the while Before his troopes, that panting went; He shewes them how to be content To suffer toyle, without constraint; Since labour could not make him faint. He is not on their shoulders borne, A Charret he did hold in scorne. Small rest and sleepe he vsd to take, And last of all his thirst would flake. For when by chance a spring they met, The thirsty Souldier (dry with heat) Constrained was to drinke, then he The last of all the troope would be Catos temperance. That tooke his share, and did forbeare Vntill the Scullions serued were. If great renowne be deemed due To goodnesse, that is meerely true; Or if that naked vertues praise (That wants successe) men rightly waighes; What euer was so much renown'd, That in our ancestors was found Were fortunes gifts, that did abound? For which of them (for happy Mart) Could challenge that as their desart? Or who could claime (as his owne good) The fame, they wanne with others blood? But this mans triumph I would more Desire to follow on this shore Whereas the Syrts doe dangers threat, And thorough Lybias parching heate; Then thrice in Pompeys Carre to wend, And to the Capitoll ascend: Or g Iuurths warre to bring to end. Behold him that true father is Vnto his Countries cause and blisse. When Rome may thinke fit to aspire Vnto her Altars sacred fire. To honor whom she needs not shame To sweare and vow by his deere name. And whom (if euer Rome should see Her state restor'd from dangers free) Hereafter him to glorifie His name she well may deifie. Now march they through a wretched soyle, That feruent heates doe parch and broyle. A clymate neere the torrid zone, Which heauens wold haue to men vnknown: Here water rare was to be found, And yet (amidst this dusty ground) One fountaine large the Souldiers spide, Where many Serpents did reside, So thicke that they the waters hide. Two sortes of venemous serpents.Vpon the brinkes the Aspickes sit, And in the midst the Dipsa's flit. When Cato saw his men opprest. VVith heates, and thirst, this fount detest, He said, O Souldier (whom vaine feare Of death, makes thee this spring forbeare) Thou needst not doubt thy thirst to slake, These waters safely thou maist take. The Serpents pest no dangers brings, Except when as with blood it mings. His sting from it doth poyson send, And with his bite doth life offend. The fountaine holsome is and pure. Cato drinkes first of suspected water.So said, he drinkes, them to assure The water that they poysnous thinke. But still (before) he vsd to drinke The last of all, during the time That they had spent in Lybias clime. Our care and labour cannot finde The cause, why Lybia is enclin'd To aire of such contagious kinde: Where many plagues abounding swarmes, Fruitfull in nought but deadly harmes. Nor yet what secret nature did, When in that soyle such faults she hid; Meaning the fable that followes. Except it be that fabling lye That ouer all the world doth flye: The which doth euery age deceiue, When for a truth they it receiue. In the extreames of Lybias soyle, Wheras the ground with heat doth broyle; And where the Ocean it confines, Warm'd with the Sunne when he declines. Those fields and Countries all abrode With foule Medusas filth was strode. No greene-leau'd woods did yeeld a shade, Nor Coulters there had furrowes made. But (with their Mistresse balefull eyes) The fable of Medusa. There onely stones and rockes did rise. Hence hurtfull nature first drew seedes, That mortall plagues in bodies breedes. About her eares there dangling hung The hissing snakes, with stinging tongue; Which (like a tresse) her backe behinde Did spred, as haire of women kinde. And, whilst about her necke they crawle, The fell Medusa ioy'd withall. Then all their heads, vp-right in ranke, Her brow did like a frontlet pranke; But when she comb'd her crawling crowne, The viprous venome trailed downe. These twelue translated verses are so ambigious in the Latine, as that it rests to the best and most probable construction that can bee made thereof. “Cursed Medusa taxlesse pries “On whom she list, with fatall eyes: “For who can feare this monsters face, “VVhen to dread death they haue no space? “For where her ghastly looke she bends, “They are trans-form'd before their ends. “And rap't away from doubtfull fate, “Preuenting feare before their date. “The bodies metamorphosed “Retaine the spirits captiued, “And (buried so within the bones) “Turne stupid, like to sencelesse stones. The Furies (with their gastly haires) Did onely stirre vp franticke feares: And Cerberus (that hellish hound) Orphæus calm'd with musicke sound. And Hydra, Hercules beheld, When he that vgly Serpent queld; But this vile monster did affright Phorcus her father with her sight. Phorcus that next doth rule and raigne To Neptune on the raging maine. Ceto her mother, with her looke, They were two other Gorgons her sistersShe scarres; her sisters cannot brooke Her vgly sight: the seas and skies She can make stone with her sterne eyes. She vttterly can raze from earth The worlds whole race of humane birth. Amidst the aire (from lofty flight) The winged fowles do fall downe-right. The wilde beasts, and the horned Harts, She into craggie rockes conuarts. And all the people in the scope That bounds next vnto Æthiope, She hath transform'd (from flesh and bones) Into hard rugged Marble stones. No creatures can her sight abide, Her hairy snakes behinde her hide, And will not of her eyes be spy'd. The mighty Atlas (Tytans sonne) That by Hesperian straights did wonne, Atlas metamorphosed by Medusa.She turn'd into a hugie rocke. The Gyants of Phlæagræan flocke, (That with their Serpents feet sometime, Did striue into the heauens to clime) She lofty mountaines of them fram'd; Whereby that Gyants warre was tam'd, When Pallas in her shield did place This grisly Gorgons hideous face. Now after that Mercurius wings Mercury the founder of the Arcadian harp, and of wrastling. (The first concorder of those strings, That on th' Arcadian harpe doe sound, And first likewise that wrestling found) Had Perseus borne vnto this place, (That tooke from Danae his race When Ioue, trans-form'd to golden showre, Into her lap himselfe did powre;) He tooke vnto him speedily The trenchant glaine of Mercurie: That glaine embrued with the staine Perseus borne of Danae, and the golden showre. Of hundred-eyed Argus slaine, The watch-man of that haifer white, That did Ioues fancy so delight. Then Pallas (that same martiall maide) Did giue her winged brother aid, Whereby this Gorgons head to gaine; And charged him his flight to straine Toward Lybissas vtmost land: But that his looke should Eastward stand. And, flying, hold a westward race, When he through Gorgons realme did trace. Then on his left arme she did binde Pallas Target. Her brazen Targe, that brightly shin'd: And bids him so the same direct, That vpon it there might reflect Medusas stone-creating eyes: Which heauy sleepe should so surprise, And rap't her sences chiefest strength, To bring dire death on her at length. But yet part of her snakie tresse This slumber could not so oppresse; But that some serpents stood an end, And did her dulled head defend, Whilst some her face did ouer-spred, And vail'd her eyes in darknesse bed. Then Pallas lent her powerfull charme To fearfull Perseus trembling arme: And did his fauchion Harpe guide, Perseus with harpe, the fauchion of Mercury, cuts off Medusa's head.That ready was to turne aside; Wherewith he straight in sunder smoat Her spatious snake-bearing throat. What face had Gorgon then I wonder, When that her necke was cut a sunder With that same crooked wounding blade? What poyson did her gorge vnlade? How many deaths from her eyes streames? Pallas could not endure those gleames: Nor Perseus (though he turn'd aside) Had scap't from being stonifi'd, If Pallas had not (with her Targe) Her feltred lockes disperst at large, And so be-clouded all her face With Snakes, that ouer it did trace. The winged Perseus (being sped With this fell Gorgons vgly head) Did minde to heauen to make repaire, And cuts the region of the aire: But (lest through Europes Clyme he might, With dammage to those coasts, take flight) Pallas enioyn'd him, with her hest, That fruitfull soyle not to infest; Nor yet that people to molest. For who would not admire the skies, When through them such a wonder flies? From Zephyrus he turnes his wings, And ouer Lybia's coasts he flings: Where was nor graine nor tillage vsd, But all with Phœbus flames enfusd. For there the Heauens and Tytans steedes Burnt all, so that no greene it breedes. And no land in the earth doth rise (With mighty shade) more neere the skies Nor Cinthia's light doth more surprise: If that (forgetfull of her way) From the right signes she trend astray. For that high land casts neuer shade Vnto the South, or Northerne glade; And yet it is a barren ground, Wherein no goodnesse can be found. But now it was with poysons fed, That drop't downe from Medusa's head. And those vilde dewes corrupt the fields, That her invenom'd sanguine yeelds. The which the heates more noysome makes, When in the putred sands it bakes. The first corruption that arose, And in the dust his head out-showes, The Aspicke was; that brings dead sleepe, And with a swelling necke doth creepe. The diuers kindes of serp?ts that were ingendred in Lybia by the drops of blood that fell from the necke of Medusa, according to fabulous antiquity With Gorgons blood he was repleate, The clottred poysons in him fret. No serpent is more poysonous, Nor in extreame more frigidous; Who (wanting warmth) doth alwayes shun The Clymes remoter from the Sunne. And all alongst the bankes of Nyle Those sands he likewise doth defile. But how great shame to vs acrues (Whom couetise doth so abuse) That we from Affricke do not spare To marchandize that noysome ware? Here also doth that hugie beast (Hæmorrhois) raise vp his crest. And whom he stings, from out the vaines All the life-feeding blood hee draines. Then the Chersydros double kinde, That in the sholes of Syrts are shrin'd. And the Chelydri in their dennes Amongst the muddy steaming fennes. And Cenchris alwayes when he slides, (Not wriggling) straight his passage guides. Whose speckled body (full of staines) More diuers colours still retaines, Then are the Theban marble vaines. And the Ammodites, whose hue From parched sands men hardly knew. And the Ceraste roming wide, Whose winding backe each way can glide. And Scytale, that winter-worme, That in cold dewes doth make his furme: And in that season casts his coate. Then Dipsas, that is all as hot. Amphisibena, harmfull fiend, That hath a head at either end. The Water-snake, that felly stings, And Darting Serpents, that haue wings. And Pharias, that doth not traile, But euer goes vpon his taile. And greedy Præster, that all rapes, Whose frothy Iawes such widenesse gapes. VVith Seps, that in contagion swelts, And very bones with bodies melts. Then that same Basiliske, whose hisse Vnto all Serpents fearfull is: So as from him they flye or hide, And come not where he doth reside. Hee lethall is before he sting, His hissing deadly harme doth bring: Therfore called Basiliscus of the greek word ????????Sole in the sands he raignes as King. And torrid Affricke likewise breedes Those plaguie Dragons, that exceedes For mischiefe, in most cruell kinde, VVhich other nations neuer finde. VVhose scalie backes doe shine like gold; And when aloft their flight they hold, (Amidst the aire with stretched wings) The heards of cattell clustring thrings. For mighty Bulles become their pray, That in their tailes they sweepe away. Huge Elephants scape not their pawes: All things to death their fury drawes: So as no poysnous humor needes To act the mischiefe of their deeds. Cato (with his stout martiall bands) Doth march alongst these parched sands That do such mortall poysons yeeld; And there with griefe he oft beheld The vncoth deaths, that so abounds, Amongst his troops of little wounds. The Serpent Dipsas turnes his head On Aulus, that on him did tread, And bites this youth of Tyrrhen race, That held an Ensigne-bearers place. The poyson of Dipsaes. He scarcely any whit was paind, Nor any signe of bite remaind. Within his lookes no death appeard, Nor threatning danger to be feard. But yet the secret poyson workes: The fire within the marrow lurkes: And suddenly the venome heates, Whilst burning gripes his bowels freats. This pestilence dispersed sinks, And all the vitall humours drinks. His pallat and his iaws grow drie; His tongue with scorching drought did frie: His wearie lims (with labouring heate) Did not as earst yeeld moistie sweate. No teares at all fall from his eyes. All moisture from the poyson flies. No reu'rence of the Empires awe, Nor Stoicke Catos martiall law, Could this incensed man affray: But he his Ensignes would display, And all about the fields did raue, Seeking where he might water haue, The which his thirsty heart did craue. Had he beene into Tanais cast, Or Rhodanus that runs so fast, Or into Poe that spreads so vast, Or into Nylus, that doth range Alongst so many countries strange; And of all these had soakt his fill: Yet would his lights haue burned still The fury of the parched ground Did make his deadly drought abound, And adde more deaths to Lybias blame, But doth detract from Dipsas fame, As not from her that all this came. He now at last the sands doth trie, Where any filthie puddles lie. And then vnto the Syrtes returnes, And bathes in floods his mouth that burnes. The stoare of waues did him delight: Yet nought asswag'd his thirstie plight. His kind of griefe he nothing knowes, Nor that his bale from poyson flowes. He thinks thirst onely his disease, The which the better to appease, With his owne sword he cuts his vaines, And with the blood his mouth he baines. Cato forthwith commanded than To take the ensigne from this man. And so twas handled that none durst To say this sickenesse came of thurst, But straight againe another dies More grieuously before their eyes. For loe a little Seps their lights On poore Sabellus thigh and bites: Who with his hand away did plucke This worme, that by the teeth then stucke. And with his pyle, that he did beare, The poyson of the SepsVnto the ground he naild it there. A little Serpent tis God knowes, But whence most cruell poyson flowes, And none doth bring more deadly throes. For all about (where he had bit) The skin and flesh away did flit: So as the bone all bared lay, The carkasse likewise melts away. One naked wound all did display. His members all with venome swell: His brawnie calues then from him fell: The synews of his hams were reft: No skin or flesh about them left: The verie muskles of his thighs Did rotting drop away likewise: His flancks to blacke corruption turnd: The midriffe shriueled vp and burnd: So as his bowels burst withall, And yet the body did not fall Together, to the ground at once: But by peace-meale dropt from the bones. Thus (with a little poysned bite) Death suddenly all parts did smite. The venome had such ample scope, That nerues and sinews it laies ope. The ribs it did vncouer quite: The hollow brest it rots outright. The vitall veines that feed the heart, And what else was of this mans part, That Nature gaue, when he tooke breath, Abandond lay to this strange death. His shoulders drop, and his strong armes, His necke and head receiue like harmes. The thawing snow melts not more fast, That feels the warmth of Southerne blast: Nor yet the waxe against the Sun Doth to more liquid humors run. But this is nothing that I say That poisons heate melts flesh away: The fire can shew the selfe same power, But what flame so can bones deuoure? For heare euen as the marrow melts, The bones likewise consuming swelts. It suffers no signes to remaine. A rapting fate so all doth straine. Of all the plagues (that Affricke tries) Thy selfe alone shalt haue the prize. The rest do bring but life to end: But thou both life and bones dost spend. And now behold another kind Of swelling death, they likewise find. The firie Prester (with his sting) Nasidius to his end doth bring. Nasidius that (with his plough shares) The Marsian fields for graines prepares. The poyson of the Prester. His face is colourd furie red: His puft swolne skin at large is spred. All forme and shape his lookes hath lost The tumor so his corps imbost. And so his veins the poyson feeds, That human measure he exceeds. One lumpe doth all his parts confound, Within a formelesse body dround. His habbergon was not of space, His swollen carkasse to embrace. The boyling caudrons frothy scum, Doth not in bubbles rise so plum; Nor yet the saile doth swell so vast, When it is puft with windy blast. The mishapt corps could scarce containe The lims, that so with swelling straine. And that same trunks confused heft, They durst not to the funerall weft, But to the foules vntoucht it left, And for a pray vnto wild beasts, If thereon they durst make their feasts. For now the swelling corps they leaue, Before the fulnesse it receaue. But spectacles of more dismay The Lybian poysons yet display. The sharpe Hemorrhois hath imprest His venom'd teeth, that did infest The poyson of the Hemorrhois. Tullus, that noble hopefull youth, A follower of Catos truth. And as we seethe Saffron staine The cloth, through which the same we straine So did this poysons ruddy taint (Like blood)) his body all depaint. The teares (that from his eyes then fell) Were drops of blood, wherewith they swell. And all the passages besides, Through which the bodies humour slides, Huge streams of blood by those vents flowes, So from his mouth, and from his nose, He liquid blood doth likewise sweate, Wherewith his members were repleate, That through the swelling veins did freate. And so his bleeding did abound, That all his body was one wound. But on thee (Leua) wretched wight The Nylus serpents rage did light. The nature of the Aspicks poyson. Whose poyson fixt remedilesse, The heart root strings did so oppesse, That of his bite no paine was felt, Yet suddenly in death didst swelt, And in a slumber tookst thy end, And so to Stygian shades discend. The poyson gathered vnawares, (That fatall Sabeas so prepares, When they a harmefull twig do chuse For francumcense, which they would vse) Doth not with that strong potion Hast death with so swift motion. But now behold from farre doth flee (Out of a hollow withered tree) A cruell serpent, like a flight, The nature of the serpent called a Iaculum. That deeply wounds where it doth light. And (whirling with a courage fierce) Through Paulus temples it did pierce. A Iaculum they do it call, It poysons not the part withall; But whomsoeuer that it wounds, There present death the life confounds. By this experience we may know, That vnto this a sling is slow, And (in compare how this doth pierce) The Scythian shaft flies not so fierce. What helpe at all doth it aduance, That Murrus hath (with his sharpe lance) The Basiliske pierc't thorow quite; When as the deadly venoms might Alongst the lance so fast doth creepe, That it within his hands doth steepe? Which he lifts vp finding the harme, The nature of the Basilisks poyson. And instantly cuts off his arme With his owne sword, which fell to ground. And he by this experience found (The hand cut off that he endures) His life thereby to him assures. But who would thinke the Scorpions sting Had such like force in poysoning, And present death with it could bring? He cruell is in deadly bites, And mortally his taile he smites. The which the heauens themselues explaine, In honor of Orion slaine. Salpuga a kind of poysnous Ants.Or who would doubt that earth to treade, Where thou Salpuga mak'st thy bed? And yet the fatall sisters three No little power haue giuen to thee, Our vitall twists to shred in twaine, By force of thy strange poysnous vaine. Thus neither by the dayes faire light, Could they find rest, nor in darke night. These wretched men were still in dread, Vpon what ground to rest or tread. For neither heapes of leaues they take, Nor bundled reeds their beds to make: But euen as men, to fates exposd, Vpon the bared ground reposd: And to the vapors, that do rise Where their warme bodies heaped lies, The chilly serpents do repaire (Offended with the nights cold aire.) Amongst their lims their skins they warme And all that while they do no harme. The cold dew doth their venome charme. Meane while the souldiers do not know What wayes to seeke, or where to go. But are directed by the skies, The murmuring and repining of the soldiers against their miserable iourney.And in this maze powre out their cries. O Gods (say they) let vs be led Vnto the field, from which we fled. Bring vs againe to Thessalie: Our hands to armes we destinie. The Serpents of Lybia.Why languish we in miserie? The Dipsaes here for Cæsar fight, And the Cærastes plead his right. Alongst the torrid zoane we run, And clymates burned with the Sun. We are well pleasd (in our dispaire) To lay the blame vpon the aire. And then against the heauens to crie, As destin'd in this soyle to die. But, Affricke, we accuse thee not, Nor nature with this fault do blot. Thou hast this hatefull soyle designd To serpents of a monstrous kind. This part of Lybia not ordained for man to liue in. And therefore hence it first did chace All meanes to nourish humane race. This earth thou barren didst ordaine, Vnfit for tillage or for graine. And in this sort thou didst decree That men from poysons should be free. But we take vp the Serpents roomes, For which we haue these heauy doomes. And thou ô God who so thou art, That dost dislike of this our mart, (Thereby to make our errour knowne) On this side setst the torrid zoane: And on the other side dost place The marine Syrts, with doubtfull race: And in the midst this noysome coast, Where we by sundry deaths are lost. The ciuill warre his armes displaies Alongst these desart vncouth waies; And now the souldiers well are taught, What miseries the heauens haue wrought. The worlds deepe secrets they haue sought But now, perhaps, some things more strange They yet may meet where they will range. In this part of the world both the Poles do seeme to be as low as the horyson. For there the Sun fals in the Seas, And, hissing, doth his flames appease: And there the nature of the Poles (Opprest to seeming) downward rolles. But no land further doth extend Vnto the West where this doth end. But Iubas realme, whose fatall name To vs is onely knowne by fame. There we shall seeke and chance to finde Lands, breeding serpents of this kinde. This comforts yet the heauens do giue, That in this soyle some of vs liue. We do not wish nor yet desire To our owne countrey to retire. Europe nor Asia we affect, Where other stars lend their aspect. But Affricke where haue we thee lost! Vnder what skie or in what cost! Art thou obscured from our host? For but euen now the winters cold We found vpon Cyrenis mold. Is so much the yeares season chang'd In this small way, that we haue rang'd? We crosse this Axle of the world, And with the sphere about are whorld: And now againe we turne our backe Once more vnto the Southerne racke. There opini? then of the Antipodes.So as, perhaps, the Roman land Iust vnderneath our feet doth doth stand. This onely comfort fate vs grant, That our foes seeke vs where we hant, That Cæfar (ere this warre be done) May follow on where we haue run. Such wofull plaints remedilesse Their suffring patience did expresse. But that their captaines noble heart Made them all pains take in good part. The bared sands was still his bowre; He tempted Fortune euery howre. Catos prsise.In all assayes he still made one, And runs when he is cald vpon. His worthie carriage comfort gaue, To souldiers, readie for their graue. And more then health did them reuiue, For they in greatest pangs would striue To hide their plaints and death defie, As long as he was present by. What power on him had any griefe, That so to others gaue reliefe? Whilst he lookt on his men he taught The greatest woes to set at nought. Fortune (that wearie was almost With plaguing of this wretched hoast) A little tast of comfort giues And them at last (though late) releeues. A people in the world there be, That are from serpents poyson free. Marmarida that land is nam'd: Psilli the people, that haue fram'd Their tongues all venoms rage to dead, As well as hearbs, that earth hath bred. No poysons force can be enfusd Into their blood, though no charms vsd. The place (by nature) doth prouide, That safe mongst serpents they recide. It profits them to leade their life The nature of a people in Lybia called the Psilli that cure the bites of Serpents. In soyles, where serpents are so rife. With them death seldome is at strife. Their blood so poyson houlds in scorne, That when a childe is newly borne, They vse this meanes wherewith to trie If it be free from Bastardie. By prouing of the Aspicks byte, To know where it be false or right. And as Ioues Eagle scans the doubt Of those warme egs the dam brings out By taking his vnplumed race, And them against the Sun doth place, And those that can (with constant eye) Behold the beames assuredly, And will not twinckle at the light, When Tytan shewes his face most bright, How the Psilli try their wiues chastitie. As his owne breed those he affects: But euery wincking squall reiects. Such triall doth the Psiilli make If their small babes dare touch a snake, Or if the infant do but play With serpents, laied in his way. These people doe not onely care How to preserue their own welfare: But strangers likewise they intend, And from those monsters them defend, And to our souldiers helpe did lend. One of the Psilli did accost An Ensigne, of the Romane host, And with our campe along he went, And when the Chieftaine pitcht his Tent, He all the host did circuite round, Intrenched on this sandie ground. That done his muttring charmes he spake, And all without great fiers did make. A medcine venoms force to slake. Medicines against the serpents poyson.In it the Dane-wort hissing heates: And Galbana there frying sweates: The Thamarix, of sullen plight: And Costrum, that hearbe-Mary hight: With Panacea, most of might: Then the Thessalian Centorie: And Maid-wort, that doth crackling frie: Long-wort, and Larix therewithall, And that, which Southernwood we call, Whose smoake the serpents so distast; And then an old Harts-horne at last, So all the night they safely past. For poysons, that do dayly hant That people magicke wonders chant. Great strugling strife these Psillans make, When they would taken-venom slake. For first of all the stinged ioint With spittle they do round annoint, Which doth the spreading venom draine, And in the wound the same containe. Then many charmes by them are sung, Still muttring with a froathie tong. And from their mumbling if they cease, The venoms rage will then increase. No minute may they hold their peace. Thus often do they with these charmes, Dissolue and quench those poysnous harms, That in the marrow festring lies. But if this course do not suffise, But that the lingring poyson stay, And to their charme will not obay; Vpon the cure he flat doth fall, And licks the pallid wound withall. The venom with his mouth he drawes, And soakes the artires with his iawes. So from the chilly corps he fets The deadly dram, and out it spets. And hauing ouercome the might Of this vile serpents mortall bite, The Psilli by the tast do finde The poysons force, and of what kinde. And by this meanes the Romane troope Are freed from that, which made them droop And now about these dismall lands They dare disperse their scattring bands. Belphœbe twice was in the wane, And twice her full light she had tane, Whilst Cato wandring in this coast Her nightly sheene had found and lost. Now more and more the mouldring sand Grew firme, and chang'd to solid land, And then a farre the souldier sees The lofty woods and greene-leau'd trees, And litle cotes with loame vp-patcht, The roofs whereof with reeds were thatcht. O what a comfort this poore hoast Conceiu'd, to finde a better coast! When first they one another show Fierce Lions ranging to and fro. Leptis a good citie on the frontiers of Lybia. He now returns to speak of Cæsar. Then vnto Leptis next they came, Where they their winter stations frame. A quiet place and fruitfull mould, Neither opprest with heate nor cold, Cæsar now (hauing coold his ire In Pharsale blood) doth thence retire. And all the waight of his affaires Against his son-inlaw-prepares, And him pursues (although in vaine) Whose troops were sperst on land &amp; maine. But Pompeys fame the seas had spred Thither his army Cæsar led. And goes vnto the straights of Thrace, Whose waues Leanders loue did grace. Where stands that fatall wailing towre Of Hero, his deare Paramour. That Hellespontus hath to name, From Helle drowned in the same. A shorter cut cannot be found Twixt Europe, and the Asian ground. Although the maine, that doth diuide Bizantium, from Calcedons side, Do run but with a narrow tide. And so Propontis (that doth take His current from the Euxine lake) Doth but a slender channell make. Here he the fame doth now explore, That runs of this Sigæan shore. And Simois, that noble fount; Here was Achilles his Tombe.And that braue Greeke of such account, That buried lies in Rhætus mount. And many other worthy sprites, Oblig'd vnto the Poets writes. He circuits then that worthy name Of Troy, destroyd by Græcian flame. And those old ruines he seeks out Of Phoebus wals so large about. But rotten trees and barren land Now hides the place where they did stand. And with their burthen do presse downe The buildings of Assarac's towne, And all their Temples so diuine The spreading rootes do vndermine. All Troy is thus with brambles cloyd, Yea euen her ruins are destroyd. Hesions rockes he likewise viewes, Hesione, Laomedons daughter. And where Anchises erst did vse (In woody shades) his sports to proue, Coying that powerfull Queene of Loue: And whereas Paris being iudge, Did on him draw great Iuno's grudge: And where that Boy was rapted vp, That now for Ioue doth beare the cup; Ganimed. And where the Troian youth did rest, When he was Nymph Oenone's guest. Paris. Each place is with some fame possest. Now vnawares doth Cæsar passe That twining streame, that dryed was, Which Zanthus he did call of yore, And carelesse treades that grassie shore. When as a Peasant of that Coast Bids him not tread on Hectors ghost: The words of a Peasant to Cæsar. There all abrode lay scattred stones Of that braue Tombe, that held his bones, Whereof no forme did now remaine. And then this Peasant said againe, What dost thou Hectors Tombe disdaine? O great and sacred Poëts toyle, That dost preserue what death would foyle! The praise of of Poësie. And to the world this boone dost giue, That mortall men shall euer liue. O Cæsar! doe not thou repine, To see the power of fame diuine. For if that we may promise ought That may by Latium Muse be wrought; As long as Smyrna's Poet lasts, Homer. And on deserts due honours casts: So long shall after ages fame Record my verse, and read thy name. And our Pharsalia shall subsist In spite of darke obliuions mist. VVhen Cæsar feasted had his eyes VVith ruines that there heaped lies Of reuerent monuments of fame, Cæsars sacrifice at Troy, and his vowes. There he of turfe in haste did frame A sacred Altar, where did flame The pretious gummes, that smoke did raise, And not in vaine in this sort prayes. Yee ghosts diuine, whose ashes cold The Troian ruines do infold, Whence my Æneas tooke his race, That in Lauinia now hath place, And in the Alban bower soiournes, Where Phrygian fires still shining burnes: And where that famous pledge doth lye (Concealed still from mortall eye) Cæsar doth challenge his descent from the Troians.Of Troian Pallas which we haue Shrin'd in a Temples secret caue. Behold before your Altars here A glorious Off-spring doth appeare, Descended from the Iulian line, Who offers vp his vowes diuine: And yeelds your Rites in this selfe place, That whilome you were wont to grace; Grant my designes a happy fate, I will againe restore your state: And Italy, the walles of Troy Shall gratefully raise vp with ioy. So Roman Pergamus shall rise With lofty Turrets to the skies. Thus said, vnto his Fleet hee goes, And all his sailes a faire winde blowes. For he desir'd to make amends For that time, which on Troy he spends. Then mighty Asia's coasts he cleeres, And past Rhodes foamy waues he steeres. So as (within seuen nights at most) He did arriue on Ægypts coast, Cæsar sailes towards Affricke.With such a friendly Easterne gale, That they nor tacke aboord did hale, Nor euer did a sheet let flye, Till Pharos Lanthorne they espye. And yet the day was new begunne, And that night lampe dyn'd with the Sunne: Before hee did approch the Port Where flocking people did resort With muttring dinne, and strange report. And therefore now (for his behoofe) Forbeares to land, and keepes aloofe; Doubting (at first) himselfe to trust With such a Nation, most vniust. But now dire presents from that King, The Captaine of his guard did bring, And comes aboord the Roman fleet, And on the seas doth Cæsar greet: With him he carries Pompeys head, With Pharian vaile all ouer-spred. And first of all he laud affoords To his foule fact, in these vile words. Great Conqueror of all the earth, Chiefe ornament of Roman birth, Pompeys head brought to Cæsar, with an Oration. That which as yet thou dost not know The Ægypt King doth here bestow Security vpon thy state, By cutting off great Pompeys date: Whereby thy labours and thy warre By land and sea, now ended are. And that which only wanting was At Pharsals field, is brought to passe. The ciuill warre thou didst entend, Is in thy absence brought to end. The ruines of Pharsalias fight, (That Pompey sought againe to right) Is by our sword extinguisht quite. Thy fauour, Cæsar, that we sought, VVith this great tryall we haue bought. And with this blood confirmd we haue The league, that we of thee do craue. Receiue this kingdome as thine owne, For which thou hast no dangers knowne. Receiue the right of all this Realme, The fruitfull soyle of Nylus streame. Receiue all that which thou wouldst giue For Pompeys head, whilst he did liue: And in thy Campe now let vs bee As faithfull followers to thee; Since by the Fates it was decreed, That we should act so great a deeed. And do not thinke this merit vile, That we our hands should so defile With slaughter of so deere a guest, By whom this kingdome we possest: When our Kings Father was put downe, Pompey restor'd him to his Crowne. What is there more for me to say? What name can such a worke display? Search all the world records that are, They all come short of this by farre. Thy debt is more, if this be blame, That for thy sake did act the same: From thee we taken haue the shame. So said, the head he did display, And from it takes the vaile away: But deaths pale hue his lookes estranged, The features of his face were changed. Cæsar at first did not despise This gift, but turn'd aside his eyes; And musing staid, the truth to sound Cæsars behauiour at the sight of Pompys headOf this foule fact, which when he found, Twas fit he thought, that they all saw He was a pious Father-in-law: Wherewith he fained teares did shed, And sighes for that, his comfort bred. Hoping this way to be the best To cloke those ioyes that in him rest, And did the Tyrants fault detest. And would the Treason rather blame, Then seeme indebted for the same. He that before with scorne did tread Vpon the Senators laid dead: And that with dryed eyes beheld The slaughter of Pharsalias field; Now dares not, Pompey, thee deny A deepe-fetcht sigh, and weeping eye. O cursed lot of dismall fate! Hast thou pursu'd this dire debate, (O Cæsar) and in that preuail'd, That now deserues to be bewail'd? The contracts of thy son-in-law, To no compassion doth thee draw: Nor yet thy daughter makes this mood, Nor little Nephewes of their blood: But thou dost hope thy teares will moue The people (that did Pompey loue) Thy Armes the rather to approue. Or else perchance thou dost enuy This traytor tyrants destiny: That any hand such power hath showne On Pompeys bowels, but thine owne: And grieu'st such meanes to others left, VVhereby reuenge from thee is reft: And that the end of Pompeys bane From the proud victors sword is tane. But whatsoeuer humor twere That made thee sigh, or shed a teare, It did no pious meaning beare. Didst thou (with such an eager vaine) Expose thy force by land and maine? And didst not meane withall, that hee In any place should ruin'd be? O well did death this act fulfill, That left it not vnto thy will! VVhat shame and blame hath heauy fate Remoued from the Roman state? That would not suffer Pompey liue, That thou (wretch) sholdst him pardon giue? And yet thou darst (with outward showes) To blinde the world in that it knowes: And fained sorrowes face dost frame, To gaine to thee a loyall name. Souldier, that vnto me do'st bring This direfull present from thy King, Cæsars words to him that presented Pompeys head. Depart my sight, beare it away: For thou dost Cæsar more betray, And worse of him it merited, Then of great Pompey murthered. For this proud fact doth vs bebarre The greatest glory of our warre; Which is, that mercy might be showne By vs, vnto our vanquish't fone. And did not this vile tyrant hate His sister, partner of his state? I quickly could thy King requite VVith equall scorne, and like despight. And, Cleopatra, send thy head Vnto thy brother for blood-shed. Cæsar reproues Ptolemey.VVhat mou'd him thus with secret might So to entrude his swords despight In actions, longing to our right? Haue we to this end conquest sought At the Pharsalian battaile fought; That we should lawlesse power affoord (In this kinde) vnto Ægypts sword? Must we our state and safety gaine By fauours, that your kingdomes daine? Shall I (that would not brooke for Mate Great Pompey, in the Roman state) Endure thee, Ptolemey, my Peere? Then, what are we a whit the neere, So many Nations to haue led Vnder our Roman Ensignes spred, If in this world there should be knowne Any, but Cæsars power alone? Or if the earth could parted bee Twixt any other man and mee? VVe should now turne our Latium Ores Aloofe from these Ægyptian shores; But that our honours are denayd: For then perhaps it would be said, That we for feare did Pharus shunne, And not as loathing this deed done. But do not you perswade your minde, That you the victors eyes can blinde; But that he knowes (had heauens hest So driuen him to be your guest) He should haue tasted the like feast. And that my head is not so vsd, Pharsalia's fortune hath excusd. I see that we haue waged warre More perilous to vs by farre, Then euer yet our minde did feare: To banishment we subiect were. Then Pompey vs pursu'd with hate, And threatnings from the Roman state: So as if we had been distrest, Then Ptolemey had vs opprest. But with his youth we do dispence; And pardon him for his offence. But to the Pharian King make knowne, A greater grace cannot be showne. See therefore you entombe the head Of such a worthy Captaine dead. Cæsar giues c?mandement for Pompeys funerall. But fashion not his funerall As though his acts were criminall, Deseruing to be hid from sight: But Incense giue him flaming bright. Of his wrong'd ghost appease the mones, And gather vp his burned bones, That on your shores lye all defac't, And in an vrne let them be plac't. So let him thereby vnderstand His father-in-law came to this land: And let his soule heare, therewithall, My feeling sorrow for his fall. Although before our vowed loue He did all other things approue: And rather chose his Pharian ward, Then our due grace his life to guard. Whereby the people reaued beene That happy day, they might haue seene. And that same concord was supprest, That had restor'd the world to rest. Cæsar pretends a meaning to haue been reconciled to Pompey. But so the heauens did now ordaine That my desires should be but vaine; Who meaning heare to lay aside Those conquering Armes, that I haue try'd VVith friendly hands, and enterview, VVe might our ancient leagues renew; And (free from grudge and ciuill strife) In those true tearmes haue wisht thy life. Thinking my paines at full rewarded, To be thy equall peere regarded Then had I (with this loyall peace) Brought it to passe that thou shouldst cease To blame the Gods for warres disgrace, And thou haue made Rome me embrace. But all these words no passion bred Amongst his mates, nor one teare shed: Neither did they at all beleeue, That he spake as his minde did giue. All sighes and sorrowes they supprest, Their faces shewd ioy in their breast. O pretious liberty, the while That they with merry lookes durst smile, VVhen Cæsars selfe did waile and rue That bloody spectacle to view! Finis libri noni. The tenth Booke. The Argvment. Cæsar arriues at Pharos Bay, And doth with dreadlesse face suruay Their Temples and their Monuments: The King with him in league assents. There Cleopatra pleades her right, And fauour findes in Cæsars sight. Then feasts and banquetings ensue, And Ægypts treasure set to view. Whilst Achoreus doth discourse Of Nylus springs and flowing sourse. Photinus doth with force employ Achillas, Cæsar to destroy. Against the Court their Armes they bend, Which Cæsar brauely doth defend; And in the secret of the night, By ship to Pharos takes his flight. Where being straighted by his foes, From thence by swimming safely goes. As soone as Cæsar (being led By him that offred Pompeys head) Had brought his Nauy to the land, And trode on Pharos wretched sand; The Fortune of this conquering guest Did with false Ægypts fate contest: Whether that now the Lagian state The Roman Armes should captiuate; Or that the Memphit murdering gleaue Should trayterously the world bereaue As well of him that conquered, The C?mentators do vary in opinion vpon the construction of these 4. verses, wherein I doe follow the exposition of Hortensius, as most probable.As of the other vanquished. “Thy death (O Pompey) did much good “To Cæsar, and preseru'd his blood “By losse of thine, whereby the Nyle “Should not the Romans trust beguile. Hence he to Alexandria Towne Goes safely, and (for more renowne) His Ensignes are before him borne, Meaning Pompeys head.And that dire pledge their wicked scorne. But he perceiues that in their breasts A secret spleene, repining rests Amongst that people, that did hate And murmure so to see their state Subiected to the Roman guise With fagots borne, which they despise, He sees their mindes, and thereby try'd Twas not for his sake Pompey dy'd. Yet in his lookes no dread appeares, But passeth on (deuoyd of feares) Vnto their Temples, and suruayes The Monuments that they did raise Of old, vnto Macedons praise. But with no pleasure sees those sights, Cæsar visits the Ægyptian monuments.Nor in those golden shewes delights. Their garnisht Gods feast not his eyes, Nor their huge walles that stately rise. He willingly discends to see The vault, where their Kings tombed bee. There he beholds the body laid Of that same Fury, that dismaid Meaning Alexander the GreatThe worlds Comerce, whereon he praid VVith happy mart so ouer-run, That Pollean Springold Philips sonne. Whose twist of life reuenging Fate Hath shortned with vntimely date. He enuies bitterly against Alexander the Great. And now his bones interred are Within an holy Sepulcher; Whose ashes rather should be strode Throughout the aire, the world abrode. But Fortune so his ghost did frend, That there a Tombe she did him lend, Vntill this kingdomes state did end. For if the world should once retaine Her ancient liberty againe, His memory would be a scorne, As fruitlesse to all Nations borne. That possibly so many lands Should subiect be to one mans hands. Macedons soyle he did forsake, The seate where he his birth did take; And conquer'd Athens he despisd, Whose state his father had surprisd: And carried on by fatall rage, With bloody slaughters warre did wage, And Asias people did engage. His sword each where is exercisd, And ouer all he tyrannisd. Strange Riuers he with blood engraines, The Persian Euphrates he staines, And Ganges, that doth India trend: On earth he was a raging fiend; A lightning, that such flames did cast, As did all lands and people blast. A starre malignant vnto Realmes; With fleetes he cuts the Ocean streames: And then he Nauies did prepare To search the seas that vtmost are: Neither the waues, nor scorching gleed, Nor barren Lybs, where Serpents breed; Nor Ammons Syrts could him withstand, He pierc'd them all with powerfull hand. Nay he was wending to the west, Whereas the Sunne declines to rest. To either Poles his heart was led, Death preu?ts Alexanders designes.And would haue drunke at Nylus head; But that his latest day him met, And Nature onely bounds could set To the ambitious haught desire, That this fierce Prince had set on fire. And with like enuie workes his bane, As he vnto himselfe had tane The whole worlds Empire for his owne, Leauing behinde him no heire knowne; Whereby great Citties, and rich soyles Abandon'd were to wrackes and spoyles. In his owne Babylon he dy'd, A terror to the Parthian pride. O shame! these Easterne nations all Macedon Pykes did more appall, Then now those people stand in feare Of Roman Piles, that we doe beare. And though the North wee ouer-awe, And Westerne clymes to tribute draw, And to the South prescribe their law; The Parths alwayes infestious to the Romans.Yet from the East we haue disgrace Affronted by Arsaces race. Crassus (with all his Roman host) Was haplesse on the Parthian coast: Whilst Macedon, that little state, Securely did suppresse their hate. Now was this boy (the King) come down From that side of Pelusium Towne, Where Nylus fall doth make a Bay: Then he the mutinie did stay, That this vnwarlike people make, And he himselfe doth vndertake To be the hostage, and procure All peace and quiet, to secure Ptolemy comes to see Cæsar. Cæsar himselfe, and all his traine, Whilst in his Court they did remaine. Then Cleopatra giues in charge, To fit for her a gally barge, Wherein she doth her selfe imbarke And findeth meanes, that in the darke The chaine, that doth the hauen barre, Cleopatra comes to Cæsar by stealth. The Pharus keeper should vnsparre; Whom she corrupts, and so she past To Cæsars lodgings in great hast. VVho thereof neuer thought nor knew Before her presence he did view. O Egypts impudence and shame! Erynnis fierce to Latium name! A strumpet to the Roman state, Vnchast, our fuell of debate! Looke how much woe and wretched toyle Fell out vpon the Grecian soyle, And with what wracks and ruine wrought That Spartan face, the Troians bought; In no lesse fury, and mishap Did Cleopatra Latium wrap. She frighted (if I so might say) The Capitoll with Systrons bray. The Systron was an instrument of warre vsed by the Egyptians instead of a Trumpet. Meaning the battell betwin Augustus and Anthonie. And would our Roman spoiles haue bore Vnto Canopo's coward shore. And Cæsar then haue captiued, And him in Pharian triumphs led. For doubtfull twas, at Actium fight, VVhat hand shold sway the Empires right, And whether that our Matron Rome Should rule the world with her sole doome. These humors that night brought to passe VVhen first this Ptolomean lasse, Did with incestious armes imbrace The chieftains of our Roman race. O Anthonie who will disproue Thee, for thy lawlesse filthy loue. Since Cæsars haughtie heart so fries, Anthony loued Cleopatra and forsooke Octauia. VVith this bewitcing harlots eyes; As that amidst the rage of armes, Amongst these broiles and chrill harmes, And in this court, where Pompeys ghost Did crie for vengeance on this coast, And whilst as yet thou wert bespred With blood, at thy Pharsalia shed, Thou wouldst admit vnto thy bed This foule adulterous venerie, And mixe thy armes with banderie; And so didst seeke to raise thy line Vpon a strumpet concubine. O shame! to Iulia this is scorne, That though her Pompey be forlorne, Thou her of brothers wouldst prouide, Begotten of a Bastard side. Thou dost constraine those Roman troops, Cæsar had issue by Cleopatra and a sonne called Cæsareon.That vnder Pharsals ruins droops, To roame about the Lybian coast, Who still from place to place are tost; Whilst thou thy time dost so mispend, And Egypts filthie lust entend, And rather pardon'st Pharos spight, Then subiect her to Roman might. To Cæsar, Cleopatra goes, And in her beautie trust repose, Cleopatras manner and speech to Cæsar.Her lookes demure and sad withall: But yet no teares she did let fall. A fained sorrow in her face, Which vnto her gaue greater grace. Her curled lockes, in carelesse wise, Dangling about her shoulders fiies, She thus her speech begins to frame. Most mightie Cæsar, great of fame, If noble birth may purchase gace, Behold one of the royall race Of Egypts blood, king Lagus childe, That am distrest and liue exilde. From my paternall lawfull right, I am withheld by maistring might; And if thou wilt vouchsafe therefore With powrefull hand me to restore Vnto my former state and place, I will a Queene thy feet imbrace That art a plannet sent by fate To render iustice to our state. Why should not I a woman raigne The crown of Egypt as capable of a Quene as a King. On those chiefe Citties, that pertaine To me by right in Nylus land? No sexe our custome doth withstand, But that it hath bene often seene This kingdome hath obeyd a queene. Reade but my fathers last bequeast, And that will shew he did inuest Me with his kingdome equally, And me espousd to Ptolomey. But let him as a boy approue Me as his sister in his loue, And in his wedlocks choise rest free; Cleopatra affects not to mary her brother as her father appointed But his affects must ruled be According to Photinns word: For in his hand he holds the sword, I nothing do desire to haue, But what my Father to me gaue: And that our family be freed From any foule incestuous deed, And that thou wouldst the powre abate Of Photyne, that doth wrong our state And do appoint (by thy behest) The king to rule as fits him best. But his base seruant is with pride So puffed vp and magnifide, She inueies against Photinus. Because that he the plot did lay, That Pompeys head hath reft away. And now the like (but Gods defend) Against thy selfe he doth entend That haynous deed, that all doth loath Hath wrong the world, and Cæsar both: Whilst Photyne prowdly doth exact To merit glory for the fact. And now lest that her words might faile With Cæsars hard eares to preuaile; Her gesture doth her speeches grace: She supplicates with flattring face, And with her chambring by night She charmes her iudge to rue her plight. So as when they had peace obtaind At Cæsars hand, with great guifts gaind; They feasted then the Roman Lord In shew of ioy for this accord. Then Cleopatra shews her port With luxurie and great resort, And there such sumptuous pride was showne As earst in Rome was neuer knowne. The place a royall fabricate Was as a temples type in state; Whose match for beauty future date Will hardly raise; the fretted ruffe, Composed was of richest stuffe. As for the beames and timber frames, Were couered thicke with golden lames. The parget of the walls did shine With snow white marble polisht fine. The Agat stood inlayed there, Commixt with purple stones each where. And euery floore they troad vpon The sumptuous entertainment the Egyptians gaue vnto Cæsar.Was paued with the Onyx stone. The Mareoticke heben wood, No where for outward building stood, But as huge posts to a beare waight Vnder those frames, that did them fraight. It was not vsde the house to grace: That timber they accounted base: The Yuory the frounts did face. Vpon the doores enlaid with art The shining shels of Indias mart, Were fixt vpon the backer part. The bedsteads were with gems set out, Spotted with Emrald round about. The implements were all bedight With yeallow Iasper glistring bright. The couerlets and carpets spred Colourd like Tyrian scarlet red: Whose die was long to take the staine, And more then once boyld in the graine. One part did shine like glittring gold, Th' other a purple hue did hold: As do the Pharean weauers vse, That mingled changes can enfuse In wouen silkes of sundry hues. Then numbers of attendant maids And pages, that the seruice aides, Discolourd blood distinct appeares In some, and some by diffring yeares. A part of them haue Lybian haire: And other yeallow tresses faire. So as that Cæsars selfe could say, Some of the Egyptians haue faire colourd haire. In all those soyles where Rhene doth stray, He had not seene, amongst the flocks Of German lasses, fairer locks. Some of their heads were frisled blacke, And from their foreheads turned backe. There were withall another sort Of hopelesse youths for Venus sport, Whose manly parts the knife had hent: But others, of a stronger bent, Stood their in place; yet scarce begins A signe of downe on all their chins. Then did the King and Princes all, Vpon their beds to feasting fall. But Cæsar (as the chiefest guest) Had highest place amongst the rest. There Cleopatra sets to view Immodestly her painted hew: So to enchant the gazers eyes. Her scepter doth not her suffise: Nor yet to be her brothers wife. About her necke there hangeth rife Cleopatras attires. The red seas spoiles, and in her heire Those pretious iewels glistring were. Her rifing brests, that snow white beene, Through the Sydonian lawns are seene: Whilst it a vaile doth ouershade, That with the Nylan neelde was made, Most curiously with threds compact: Yet with the combe so nycely slackt, As that some places being thinne, It did bewray her lilly skinne. Before them all round tables stood, (Fram'd of the rare Atlanticke wood) On tresles made of Iuorie, Such as againe of Cæsars eye Were neuer seene, though Iubas soyle Soone afterwards fell to his spoyle. The Egiptians folly so to discouer their abundant treasures to CæsarO blind and mazde ambitious rage, That sets thy treasures on a stage To him, that ciuill warre did wage; So to Prouoke with riches charmes A guest, so powrefull great in armes! For though he were not then in case, With wicked warre to run the race, That might with wracke the world constrain, For riches sake and greedy gaine; Yet were those captains, that of old In poorer times great names did hold, Subsisting now in woonted mood, Fabritians, and the Curian brood, And that braue Consull, that was tane (In hast for need to saue Romes bane) From plowing the Hetrurian lands, Where he was toyling with his hands; Those would haue gladly giuen their doome To bring such triumph spoiles to Rome. Their costly cates were seru'd in gold, The excesse of a feast.What euer might be bought or sold, That earth, or aire, or Ocean yeelds, Or Nylus flood, and fruitfull fields, Or whatsoeuer could be found To make this luxurie abound, Ambitious pride made it be sought, That in the world was to be bought: Alluding to the Idolatrous Egyptians that worshipped beasts &amp; birds.Not onely hunger to suffise, But for to feast their wanton eyes With beasts, and birds of sundry store, Which (by their sacred rites of yore) Th' Egyptians did as Gods adore. The water, for to wash their hands, In clearest cristall basons stands: The bowles, wherein they drinke their wine, Mareotis a little Prouince in Egypt that yeelds the best wines. Were made of pretious stones that shine: But Mareotis grape pleasd not: A nobler wine then it they got, That had bene kept for certaine yeares, And with the age the strength appeares. A place where the pleasant Muscadine grapes do grow. Falermums fragrant wine it was, That froths and spurtles in the glasse. Then Garlands must their heads enclose Of pleasant Nard, that greene still groes, And neuer sheeds his flowring rose. When on their balmed haire they throw Those pretious powders that do grow In Easterne Inde, that had not lost The Egyptian Ladies did vse to pouder their haires as now a daies is vsed. The sent and sauour of that cost, Mixt with Amomum gatherd new, Brought from the countries where it grew. Here Cæsar learnes to take the spoyles Of all the whole worlds richest soyles, And now the warres hee doth detest, That his poore son-inlaw opprest, Wishing withall that some debate Might turne his Mart on Egypts state. When now at length they all were fild With pleasant wines, that they had swild, And daintie meates of sundry tast, With banquetting closd vp at last; Cæsar begins (for more delight) With talke to entertaine the night, And with sweet words and pleasant grace To Achoreus (of the race Of Egypts breed, who in that place Did sit vpon a bench of state) In this sort did his mind relate. Cæsars word to Achoreus The Egyptian priest. O reuerend sire, that for thy part To sacred rites deuoted art, That with the Gods hast such esteeme, As by thy aged yeares may seeme; To me the first beginning shew, From whence th' Egyptian race did grow, The climate of this fruitfull land, And how the peoples customes stand, And of your Gods the forms and rites, The which your old records recites: And what ingrauen is in stone, Vpon your Pyramides make knowne: Reueale your Gods, that would be showne If your fore-fathers did their art And sacred mysteries impart To Plato, of a Grecian name; Then may you well reueale the same To Cæsars selfe; for where can rest In all the world a worthier guest To whom your skill may be exprest? I must confesse that Pompeys name Was some cause, that did make me frame My iourney to the Pharian coast: And yet when all my warres were most, I euermore did giue my mind, The motions of the stars to find: My thoughts were to the heauens enclind. Cæsar reduced the yeare to a iuster account then Eudoxus did.So as Eudoxus Calender Shall not surpasse my framed yeare. And therefore, as within my brest A great and true desire doth rest Of knowlegde, and of vertues lore: So nothing do I couet more, Then to finde out the secret course From whence this riuer takes his source: Cæsars desire to find out the springs of Nylus head.And where his fountaines head appears, That lies vnknowne so many yeares. O I will hope at last to see Where Nylus springs for certaine be, And so from ciuill warre rest free. So Cæsar makes an end to speake, And this graue sire did silence breake. Cæsar I thinke that well I may These mysteries to thee bewray, That our great Fathers hidden kept, And in their thoughts obscured slept, Achoreus answer to Cæsars demands. Reserued from the vulgar waies From age to age to these our daies. Let others thinke it pietie To silence any mysterie: But I do deeme the Gods aboue The worke as gratefull will approue, That their great wonders should be showne, And sacred rules to all made knowne. When first an order was ordaind, Whereby the world should be maintaind, A diuers motion to the starres Was giuen to hold concordant iarres, That they the orbs might onely sway And temper in their whirling way, Contrarie to that rapide Pole, That first of all doth mouing rolle. The Sun doth still diuide and steare The times and seasons of the yeare, And so the daies to nights doth change, And doth restraine the stars to range About their orbs with powrefull rayes. His station staies those wandring wayes. The Moone her alteration breeds Vpon the seas, and earthly seeds. Old Saturne his empiring holds On freezing zoanes and ycie colds. And Mars with wrathfull looke abashes The boisterous winds and lightning flashes. Great Ioue no tempests doth procure, But keepes all in milde temperature. And fruitfull Venus of her grace Doth cherrish seeds in euery place. Whilst Mercurie with charming vaine Doth moderate the wild vast maine. Now when Cyllenius doth appeare In that part of the wheeling spheare, Where Leos sparkling torchets are In enterchange with Cancers starre, Where Syrius with his scorching ray, Contagiously enflames the day, And where the circle that doth change The yearely season; iust doth range Betwixt the Tropicks equally, Vnder whose couert Nyle doth lie. Which when this powre (I say that keepes An order in the raging deepes) Doth touch with his starres influence; Nylus as hauing thereof sence, His channell lifts with swelling crest, Scorning within his banks to rest. Iust as Neptunus Empire flowes, When Phœbes horned visage growes. Nor doth he call his streames againe In their old harbour to remaine, Vntill the Sun by his decline Do vnto the night those houres resigne, (That halfe the yeare he kept away) To make her equall with the day. The olde conceit is but a dreame Of this increase of Nylus streame, That Æthiopias molten snowes Is cause of her great ouerflowes. For in those mounts the Northern stowre, Nor Boreas blasts haue any powre. And to assure thee that is true, Marke but the peoples Sun-burnt hue. And those warme vapours that they find Perpetually from Austers winde. He refels their opinions that do thinke the fals of the molten snow to be the cause of Nylus increaseThen for more proofe adde this likewise, That euery riuer that doth rise By falling of the molten yse, Doth then begin to be embost When summers spring first melts the frost. But Nylus neuer waxeth hire, Before the Dog-starre breaths his fire. Nor euer doth her waues restraine, To keepe within her banks againe: But when as Libra with iust paise. Doth equallize the nights and dayes. Againe those rules do beare no sway With Nyle, that other streames obay. For winter giues to him no pride. His fountaines then their forces hide. But when the temper of the skies Most feruently with burning fries, Amidst those heates then out he flies. And cooles those lands that fire would wast, Which vnderneath the line are plast. So Nylus helps the world to swage The scorching flames of Leos rage. And being cald doth giue redresse To his Syene in distresse: Syene a cittie vpon Nylus. When Cancers heates do it oppresse. And from these fields draws not his streams Vntill the force of Phœbus beames In Autumns season do decline, And Neroe do shade the shine. Now who can hereof tell the cause? But so great Nature giues her lawes, That Nylus thus should range his flood, Diuers opinions for the flowing of Nylus. And needfull tis for humane good. But former times haue vainely guest This cause; of winds blowne from the west, Who with great force the aire doth chace With long continuance in one place. And that this occidentall blast Doth driue the watrie clouds so fast A thwart the South: and their in showres Downe right vpon the Nylus powres. Or that the seas, so often tost, And beating on the Zoylan coast, The very furie of the maine Repels the riuer backe againe. So as (restrained of his way By the vast Oceans powrefull sway) Aloft beyond his bounds doth stray. There are againe that do suppose That his great inundation growes Of moisture, breathing from the earth, Whose steaming vapors haue their birth Within the concaues of the ground, And belcht out where great rifts are found. And that these moistures meerely are By secret courses drawne from farre, Out of the Northerne Region, By the attracting middle zoane: When Titans arrows (shot down right) On Meroe do parching light; And to the burned land it brings The waters from farre rising springs. Ganges and Padus send their streames In secret thorow many realmes. Then Nylus powres out by one vaine All riuers that he doth retaine. But many outlets makes of these, When he conuaies them to the seas. Another fancy many holds That the vast Ocean, which enfolds The circuit of the earth about, Flowing from farre at last breakes out, With violence, where Nyle doth range, And (with long tracke) at length doth change The salt sea streames to waters sweete, Whilst through earths bowels they do fleet. Some thinke againe that these maine waues Rapt by the Sun when Cancer raues Into the middle regions height, VVhich cannot well retaine their weight, The nights do them againe distill On Nylus flood, and his banks fill. But I (ô Cæsar) do beleeue (If I may be so bold to giue My censure in so great a doubt) VVhen many ages were run out; After the worlds first fabricate; Some wattery waues but new create VVithin the earth; by fatall stroake Brake out, which God did not prouoke: And some againe there being had, When this great All at first was made: Which the Creator high doth hold Vnder a constant law controld. But that desire that leades thee so (Great Roman Lord) the cause to know Why Nylus doth thus strangely flow, The Pharian Tyrants heretofore, And Greekes, and Persians did explore, How many great Kings searched to know the secretes of Nylus and his fountaines. And euery age desir'd the praise Of leauing vnto future dayes The knowledge of this mystery: But Nature still with secresie Conceales it from discouery. That great Macedon, King of Kings, (Whose high renowne our Memphis rings) Did Æthiopian men select, To search the cause of this effect. In scorne of Nylus those hee sends To suruey Affrickes vtmost ends. But loe! the Torrid Zone with heates, Held them from doing of those feates, To see what springs warme Nyle repleates. Then to the Westerne furthest land Sesostris goes, and takes in hand This busie taske, and with great pride To draw his Charrets, Kings he tide. But Rhodonus and fertile Poe Your Riuers he might sooner know, Then euer he could come to drinke At Nyles concealed fountaines brinke. Then fierce Cambyses Easterne throng, Comes where the people liue so long: But his huge traine was staru'd for meate; So as at last themselues they eate: And then return'd with nothing gain'd, Nyles springs to him vnknowne remain'd. No fables euer yet did dare The head of thy springs to declare. But whosoeuer thee hath seene, Yet are to seeke where thy heads beene. No nation hath attain'd the fame To know from whence thy rising came. But yet ô Nyle I will relate So much of thy discouered state, As that great God shall giue me leaue, From whom thou dost thy course receaue. Thou risest from the Southerne Pole, And with thy swelling streames dost role Against hot Cancers fiery face, And forth-right North dost run thy race, Amidst Boötes wheeling chase. Somtimes thy streams doth westward trend: And sometimes to the East doth bend. Sometimes thou seest Arabia's lands, What these Seres are, all the Commentators are doubtfull, and doe think the word to be mistak?. But such there are towards the North-pole.And sometimes shar'st with Lybias sands. The Seres first of all thee see: Yet whence thou art vncertaine be. Through Æthyopia thou dost stray; But from what fount they cannot say. No land that to the world is knowne, Can claime thy birth to be her owne. Nature hath not discouered To any wight thy secret head: Nor euer, in a slender streame, Wert thou seene run through any Realme. For Nature, that thy fountaine hides Within her bosomes, so prouides, Men rather should admire thy course, Then know from whence thou tak'st thy source. Thy waues permitted are to clime, The Solstice being in his prime. A winter strange makes thy increase: Then thou beginst when others cease: Onely to thee is granted grace From Pole to Pole to run thy race. Towards the South thy head doth rise, Neroë the greatest Island that is in Nylus.And in the North thy current dyes. Neroë (that blacke people breedes) Thy riuer there diuided feedes. And doth that Isle inuiron round, VVhere pleasant Heben doth abound; VVhich trees, altough still full of greene, Yet shelters not with shade the sheene: For on it with a downe-right line The Lyon bands his fiery eyne. Thou shewst thy face to Phœbus rage: And yet thy streames doe not asswage. The barren sands thou meetst in length; Sometimes collecting all thy strength, And branches into one selfe streame: And then againe through Ægypts Realme Thou dost disperse them all abrode: Thy bankes with ease are ouerflowd. Then thy slow chanell calles amaine His ranging riuelets backe againe, Where Phile, that doth frontring stand Phile, a Citty neere Nylus. On borders of Ægyptian land, Doth from Arabia diuide That kingdome, through which thou dost glide. Then through those desarts thou dost cut, That all that great comerce doth shut Betwixt that sea of scarlet staine, And the earth middle cutting maine, Running but with a gentle traine. But who (O Nylus) now would wot That thou, which here dost mildly flote Shouldst suddenly enraged fret, With such a violent out-let? For when the rugged broken wayes Thy falling water-courses stayes, And steepy Cataracts from hye A gentle passage doth deny The Cataracts of Nylus. Thy waues, that no resistance finde, Scorning that rocks their race should bind, Do spit their foame into the winde, And with the brushing that they make, The very aire and shores doe quake. With murmuring rut the mountains sound, And this streames froth doth so abound, As that (with strain'd resistlesse might) His boisterous billowes all turne white. Here is that Ile of Abatos, Abatos, an Iland by Memphis, not to be approched for quick-sands, as some write.As reuerent ancients did suppose, A mighty land, and whereas first Those thundring roarings out doe burst. And where the rockes (as they haue said) With springing vaine this streame doth aid. For proofe whereof this signe is plaine, That here he swels anew againe: Here Nature doth with hilles enclose These stickle streames, that wandring goes, Which doth thee Nyle from Lybia hold, And thy huge heaped waues enfold Within a spacious valley deepe, Through which thy swelling chanels sweep. Then Memphis to thee freedome yeelds, By lending thee her open fields, And doth forbid within her land That any bound should thee withstand. Thus they the time securely spent, Till mid-night vail'd the Element, And as in peace tooke their delight; But yet Photinus trayterous spright, Since he that sacred blood had spilt, Prepared was for any guilt: And thought that no fact was vn-milde Now Pompeys death had him defilde: Whose ghost did broyle within his breast, And him with murdrous mood possest. The Gods likewise (with vengeance due) Stird vp in him presumptions new: For he his abiect hands reputed Photinus conceiues a practise of treason vpon Cæsar.Worthy with blood to bee poluted Of Cæsars selfe, that was the man By Fortunes hest designed than The powerfull Roman reuerent state To ouer-awe, and captiuate. The scourge that ciuill warre should haue, And vengeance, that the Senate craue, Was almost left vnto a slaue. But O the ruling Fates we pray, To turne from vs that fault away, That Cæsar may not haue his meed, If Brutus hand doe not the deed. For else the Roman Tyrants blame Shall chastisd be, vnto our shame, By Ægypts sword, and thereby shall Iustice example quaile withall. But still this viper Fates prouoke To giue this tyrants necke the stroke; And yet he doth not now prepare With secret plots his life to snare: But openly meanes to assaile The Captaine, whom no Mart could quaile. Such hope his wickednesse hath bred To triumph ouer Cæsars head; And will (O Pompey) do his best That Cæsars fate with thine may rest: And by a secret seruant sends These lines, to shew what he entends, And to Achillas them commends, That was his partner in the deed VVhen Pompeys murther was decreed. This man the boyish King did call Achillas the Generall of Ptolemeys forces. To be Lieuetenant Generall Of all his force, and in his hand He puts the sword, and all command; Exempting nothing from his might, No not himselfe by Kingly right. Rest quietly on thy soft bed, Photinus letter to Achillas. And with sweete sleepe be thou fat fed. Yet now (quoth he) be well aduisd, For Cleopatra hath surprisd The Palace, and is there obay'd; The Realme not onely is betray'd, But giuen to her, as proper right, By Cæsar, and his Roman might. Wilt thou forbeare, thus hard bested, To violate thy Mistresse bed? The wicked Sisters nuptiall vowes Establish't her, her brothers spouse: And now this Lord of Roman race Doth her his Concubine embrace. So as betweene her husbands twaine, On Ægypt she will rule and raigne, And well deserueth Rome to gaine. VVith charming poysons shee knew how To her to make the old man bow. And if thou (wretch) do trust the boy, VVhom if one night she doe enioy, And once with her bewitching face VVithin her Armes do him embrace; So that if he once draw the fires Of her incestious hot desires: For euery kisse she will entice That our two heads shall pay the price. And if his sister him delight, Those loues will turne to our despight. Cleopatras hate to Photinus &amp; Achillas.The King her husband will obay, Adulterous Cæsar she can sway. So both of vs (I must confesse) Shall stand condemn'd remedilesse. If she should bee our cruell iudge, That long hath borne vs mortall grudge. VVhom doth not Cleopatra hate Of vs, as hainous to her state? From whom hath she her loue restrain'd And held her chastity vnstaind? And for thine owne sake I require, And by that deed wee did conspire, VVhereby our selues we did engage (VVith mutuall league) to Roman rage, For Pompeys blood, which we haue shed. Plucke vp thy spirits, and cast off dread: Raise sudden warre and tumults broyle: Breake in with force, and put to spoyle Their chambring sports, and nuptiall flame, And murder that incestious Dame Euen in her bed, where she doth rest, And whosoeuer is her guest. And let it not our courage bate, The Fortune of this Roman mate. For she hath raised his renowne, And made him tread the whole world down. That glory we will share alone, When he by vs is ouer-throwne. And we already are renown'd For Pompey, whom we did confound. Behold with hope the Pharian shore, As witnesse of that bloody gore: Consider by those waues distain'd, What liberty to vs remain'd. See there a slender heape of sands, That for a Tombe to Pompey stands. So as the same doth scarce suffise To heale his body where it lies; And yet this man so scorned heere, In scorne hee tearms Pompey Cæsars equall. To him thou fearst was equall Peere. What though no Royall blood we haue? The subiects wealth we do not craue; Nor after Kingdomes do we raue. This onely fact our state will raise: Fortune to vs these men betrayes. And so then in the necke of this There is prepar'd a greater blisse. The second slaughter will vs make Belou'd of Rome for freedomes sake. And this aduantage we shall gaine, If Cæsar by our hands be slaine: Photinus hopes to gratifie the Roman state by murdering Cæsar, as he hop't to please Cæsar by killing Pompey. Those we for Pompey did offend, Will loue vs for this Tyrants end. Why should his name giue vs affright? What need we feare his martiall might? For if his troopes doe from him fall, Him but a souldier wee may call. This night shall end these ciuill warres, And expiate Pharsalias skarres: And send vnto the shades below His head, which he the world doth owe. Then to this worke with courage fall, And so cut Cæsars throat withall. Let Lagean youths performe this thing, As due, for safety of their King, And liberty to Rome to bring. In any wise vse no delay: For thou shalt take them at a bay, Feasting themselues with dainty meate, Quaffing sweet wines in Bowles repleate, And so prepar'd for Venus heate. Doe thou but dare, and make no doubt, The Gods will bring it so about, That Brutus vowes, and Catos will Shall rest in thy hand to fulfill. Achillas was not slowly bent To this bold fact to yeeld consent. No publique Ensignes he displayes, As was the vse his force to raise; Achillas prepares forces to surprise Cæsar.Neither did he his troopes draw out With Trumpets sounds, or Souldiers shout; But suddenly his martiall bands Do take their weapons in their hands: Whose greatest part, that Armes did beare, The trained Latium Souldiers were, Who had their duties much forgot, That such corruption so should blot Their honour, and their Countries fame, To follow one of seruile name. And as their Captaine to obay A man, in mercenary pay: When Ægypts King was not of worth Himselfe in warres to lead them forth. No faith nor pietie remaines In those that follow camps for gaines, For hired hands payes hope retaines. And commonly they will accost The leader, that doth giue them most. No trust in mercenary Souldiers.The slender pay they had before To armes prouokes them now the more. And not that Cæsars head they sought, But great rewards their aid had bought. O Liberty growne too too base! Such is the wofull Empires case, That euery where her cankred mindes, For ciuill strife ocasion findes. This Army (from Pharsalia led) On Nylus shore new rage hath spred. Like ciuill strife in Latium bred. What more durst Ægypts force haue done If after Pompey they had runne? The Romans apt to ciuill dissention For all their hands they doe combine To act what higher powers designe: No rest remaines for Roman line. So hath it pleasd the Gods of late To rent the limbes of Latium state: Nor Pompeys, nor yet Cæsars cause These people now to fury drawes. A Pharian Captaines larger payes This ciuill strife anew doth raise. And here his force Achillas bends, Who Roman liberty pretends. And had not destiny ordain'd, That their hands should not be distaind With Cæsars blood (by Fates protected) Their purpose then had beene effected. Photinus and Achillas both Were prest to scoure this Court of sloth, Cæsar his carelesnesse whilst he was in Cleopatras company. That so with feasting was possest: VVhere all sorts did so carelesse rest: Treason might choose what time was best. The Bowles, that on the Cup-boords stood Might haue beene fild with Cæsars blood. And to the Table of the King His head they easily might bring. But that these Captaines then did doubt The hazard of a nightly rout; Lest that confusions murdrous might Shold wrong the work that they would right: For if this rage to chance were left, Thy life (O King) might so be reft. It is ill trusting to the moderation of the sword in the fury of fight.So hard it is to rule the sword, When fury freedome doth affoord. Thus they refusd to take that time, For to effect their bloody crime: And do the best occasion lose To act the worke they did propose. But these fresh-souldier-seruile lowts, Of fitter seasons make no doubts: And therefore did that houre delay. By night they would not Cæsar slay; His date was kept to see day light, And by that meanes gaue him this night. Opportunity in martiall affaires once lost is hardly recouered.Thus by Photinus onely grace, Cæsar did run a longer race, Whilst Phœbus shew'd againe his face. By this the messenger of day Bright Lucifer did then display His glittring face, from Cassium hill, And Phœbus first gan to distill His warmth vpon the Pharian coast, When from the walles they saw the hoast A farre off marching on the sands, Not rang'd abrode in single bands, Their foolish discipline in seeking to surprise Cæsar.Nor yet in seuerall cohorts spred; But in one squared front were led, As if they should now charge their foes In armed bulke with present blowes. But Cæsar puts no trust at all Of safety in the Citties wall. The Palace his defence he makes, And base by-wayes he vndertakes. For all the Court (in this hot Mart) Did not to him their aid impart. Cæsar dangerously engaged.Therefore a little place he guards, And thither all his force awards. Then feare and fury him possest, Doubting the place might be opprest. And yet to dread he did detest. So doth the noble Lyon rage, When he is pend within his cage. And with his tearing teeth hee tries To force the prison where he lies. And so, O Mulciber, like vent Apt comparisons. Would thy flames seeke for their assent, That in Scycillias cauernes blast, If Ætnas top were closed fast. He that of late by Æmus mount, At Pharsals field, made slight acccount Of all Hesperias noble traine, And did the Senates force constraine, (Though Pompey did their Army guide, And small hope in his right affide) All feare at that time did disdaine, And hop't a wrongfull cause to gaine; Yet this man so a captiue slaue Small things do oftentimes more annoy men then greater. (With hazard of his life) did braue, And in the Court where he did rest, VVith darts and weapons him opprest. He whom the fierce Alani's might, Nor Scythians rage could ought affright, Nor yet the Moore, that killes in iest VVith wounding darts, his friendly guest: Yea he that could not bee content VVhen all Romes Empire he had hent. But thought all those dominions small From Inde, to Tytans westerne fall; Now like a boy, in warres vntrain'd, Or woman-like, with walles restraind, VVithin a house for succour flyes, And so (to rescue life) relies Vpon the hope of shut vp wayes, And in and out vncertaine straies. But with him doth the King retaine, Cæsar holds Ptolemey with him for his security. To be partaker of the paine, And as a sacrifice be slaine, If Cæsar must his life resigne. For (Ptolemey) that head of thine Shall pay the price, if sword or fire Cannot suppresse thy seruants ire. So did that sauage Colchis Queene (With murdrous sword) expresse her spleene Vpon her brothers members shred, Fearing reuenge, because she fled, When as her father and the state Pursued her with deadly hate. But Cæsars last hope that remain'd, Was that a peace might be obtain'd; And sends one of the Tyrants guard To check those men that thus had dar'd, And from the King, and in his name To disallow this heynous blame, And learne the Authors of the same. But lawes of Nations were reiected: And he that was for peace directed (As legat from the Tyrant sent) Thought that those vipers neuer meant The holy lawes of leagues to hold, Nor that those monsters vncontrold, Which thy soyle (wicked Ægypt) breedes, VVould Iustice keepe in their false deedes. But neither the Thessalian warre, Nor Iubas kingdome stretching farre, Nor yet the force of Pontus Realme, Nor those dire Ensignes, that did streame Amidst Pharnaces armed hoast, Nor toyles of the Iberean coast, Luxury and pleasure dangerous to great men.Inuiron'd with the circling maine, Nor Syrts with their Barbarian traine, Could Cæsars fate so much distress, As banqueting and wantonnesse. VVith force on all sides he is prest, And showres of darts the house molest, The buildings shake, and yet no stroke Of battring Ramme did them prouoke: The walles they would haue ouer-throwne, But Engines for the warre had none: Nor fireworks, that should make the way. The giddy rout do gadding stray, And round about the Palace runne: All is without direction done. And no one place for all their rage With one maine strength they do engage. The fates forbid, and fortunes hand Doth as a wall for Cæsar stand. The court likewise on all that side Whereas the seas with swelling tide Vp to the banke doth bring his waues, And that lasciuious structure laues, The armed ships assalting braues. But Cæsar at defence doth stand, In euery place with valiant hand. Some with the sword he doth affray, And some with fire doth chace away. Cæsars valor. During this siege, in all affrunts, Himselfe sustaines the chiefest brunts. His resolution neuer quaild: Such courage in his mind preuaild. Then he commands his men to greet With wild-fire bals the neighbor fleete, And flaming darts amongst them throwes, Which they of pitch and tarre compose, And such like stuffe, that soone would take, And where it lights quicke riddance make. The sailes and ropes are all on flame, The decks and ore-lops do the same. Each where the pitch and tarre that melts Amongst the timbers burning swelts. And in a trice the fier doth flit Vnto the Benches, where doe sit The Gally slaues, and then likewise Vnto the yards and masts it flies. So as the ships, burnt past the brinke, The ships fired in the hauen. Amidst the seas downe right do sinke. And now the foes, and all their armes Vpon the waues do flote in swarms. Neither the ships alone do frie, But all the houses (standing nie The shore) are with these flames opprest, Anu with the wind the rage encreast. Whose blasts disperse the sparks aloofe, And so do creepe from roofe to roofe. Which through the aire casts blazing beams Like to a fierie Meteors streames, Whose substance being spent and gone, Yet flashes in the aire alone. This raging wracke and burning rut The citie of Alexandria fired, at which time the famous library was burnt.Out of the Court (still being shut) Doth peoples aide from thence desire, To free the cittie from this fire. And Cæsar now the meanes doth take, And of this fright aduantage make, The time he doth not sleepe away, But safely doth himselfe conuay Into a ship, by darke of night, Vsing therein a happy sleight. His wont was such in all his mart To vse dispatch, and take the start When as occasion was presented. Whereby the foe he still preuented. And Pharos now he doth surprise, Which barre before the hauen lies. Whilom an Iland, but it stood In midst of that same Pharion flood, When Proteus their Prophet was. But now this Ilands heaped masse, (With trackt of time and sands that fall) Stands nearer to the citties wall. Cæsar, when he the place did take, A double vse thereof did make. It stops the pursuit of his foes, Cæsar for safety takes Pharos Photinus put to death. Here it seems that in the former parts some thing is w?ting for no relation is euer made how Photinus came within Cæsars power.And can the hauens mouth dispose. Now when at first he had suruaide The sea, made free to bring him aide; He then resolu'd, without delay, Photinus head the price should pay, But therein Cæsar nought obseru'd The rigor that the wretch deseru'd. Vnto no torment was he put, Nor yet amongst wilde lyons shut, Nor liuing was with fire blasted: He died, but neuer torture tasted, They him to good a death afford: His necke but sundred with the sword. A wretched worke it was, God wot, That Pompeys death should be his lot. Arsinoe the sister of Cleopatra. Now had Arsinoe obtaind Her libertie, that was restraind, By secret slights along time sought, Which Ganimed her seruant wrought. And then with Cæsars foes takes part. Who wanting one to rule their mart; She (as the daughter of their king) Assumes thereof the managing. And to that Tyrants murdrous slaue, Achillas slaine Achillas she due iustice gaue: And from his corps his head did shaue. So now another sacrifice To thee (ô Pompey) bleeding lies, Reuenge obserued for P?peys murder. For expiation to thy ghost: But fortune will bestow more cost. And heauens forbid this should be all The offrings for thy funerall. The tyrants selfe of worth is not, Nor all his Realme to cleare that blot. And till the Senatorean state On Cæsars bowels venge their hate Pompeys reuenge will be in date. But yet this broile and martiall rage These leaders deaths could not asswage For now againe fresh stirs arise From Ganimed, with more supplies, Which fiercely doth on Cæsar presse, And giue a charge with shrewd successe. This one daies danger was so great, That Cæsars fortune it did threat And so mought Ganemedes name Throughout the world haue flown with fame For whilst that Cæsar doth prouide Cæsar in great danger. (In emptie ships from tother side) Some armed troop and old cohort Vnto this Ile for his support; Vpon a sodaine many foes With armed force do him enclose. On this side hostil ships do keepe The shoares, and barre him from the deepe. Behind his backe the traitors bands (In filed ranks) with weapons stands. No hope of safetie doth remaine: No place for flight, all valour vaine. And (that which did him most offend) Scarce meanes to find a glorious end. No force he had whereby he might In martiall sort frame any fight. Now Cæsars fortune must be lost: And yet nor fight, nor slaughter cost: Coopt vp, whereas the place affords No triall there for bloody swords. Thus doubtfull musing whether tweare Fitter to die or basely feare; He sternely casts his eyes behind, And sees his foes in troops combind. The force of braue examples in extremitie.Wherewith he cals vnto his mind Scæua his souldier, that with fame Had purchast such a glorious name. For that braue end and dantlesse spright Which he shewed at Dyrachium fight. Where he alone the Rampart kept, And neuer once retiring stept, When Pompey had the walles beat downe, Yet from them all did win renowne. In the Lattin copie these verses, to the end were supplied by Sulpirius and so translated.This memory of Scæuas Mart Puts courage into Cæsars heart, And nobly hee resolues to dye VVith fame, that through the world shold fly But his designe the Fates gaine-say, Fortune shewes him a safer way. For, as he casts his eye aside, Vpon his left hand he espide Ships of his friends, that there did ride. To swim to them he doth entend, And therewith said, what shall we end Our Fortunes here by villaines slaine? Or rather sinke amidst the maine? Then shall this Eunuch Ganimede Cæsar saues himselfe by swimming. No conquest gaine on Cæsars head. So hauing sayd; he brauely leapt Into the sea, but safe he kept His bookes within his left hand drie, And with his right the waues doth trie. So through the deeps he safely swamme Vntill amongst his frends he came Who him receiue with ioyfull cries, That to the Heauens with Ecchos flies. Finis libri decimi.</field>
