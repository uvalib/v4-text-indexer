      <field name="fulltext">A SUMMER CHRISTMAS. A STORY IN RHYME. Dedicated to MRS GEORGE CAWSTON. DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. John Cobham, a Professor in the Melbourne University. A Man of Kent. English born. Charles Forte (the Squire's Brother), a Queensland Squatter and a Victorian Station-holder. English born.. Helen Forte (the Nellie of the Squire's Brother), his Wife. English born.. Mary Ridley, Governess to Lil and Margaret Forte. English born.. William Forte, Child of Mr and Mrs Forte. Australian born. Philip Forte, Child of Mr and Mrs Forte. Australian born. Elizabeth Forte, Child of Mr and Mrs Forte. Australian born. Margaret Forte, Child of Mr and Mrs Forte. Australian born. Kit Johnstone, the daughter of a neighbouring Station-holder. An Amazon. Australian born. Ida Lewis, a young Widow from Melbourne. Australian born. Maud Morrison, a Melbourne Belle. Australian born. Launcelot, M.P., an ex-Minister of the Crown in Victoria, nicknamed “Chesterfield.” Australian born. Albert Hall, a Bushman—Phil Forte's partner in a Queensland Run. Australian born. Lachlan Smith, a Barrister in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Australian born. The Scene is laid at Waratah Station, a fictitious Station in the Western District of Victoria, beyond Ballaarat. At Waratah one Christmastide Were sitting by the hall-fire side, With fire unlit, a company Gathered for the festivity. 'Twas Christmas-eve, and they were at A station beyond Ballaarat, Out on the plains. The paddocks were Well cleared of timber, scrub and burr, And English-grassed, the house no hut Built of bark slabs or boarded cot But such a mansion as you see In passing by the Werribee, Stone built, with gardens well laid out In gay beds, planted all about With choice exotic shrubs and trees And all that could subserve or please A wool-king with a broad freehold All round his home, and flocks untold On his huge runs on Queensland downs, And, though far off from seaport towns, With every luxury, now brought From home, for wife and children bought. Most noticeable of them all Around the fireside in the hall Was this prince of the squatterhood, Who, standing in his stockings, stood Six feet and inches almost three, Strong, and of hand and speech so free, And still as active as a lad, Though sixty years and hardships had Grizzled his hair and beard with grey; A hero who had fought his way, From pittance left him by his sire (As younger brother of the squire), To wealth immense by years of toil, Exiled from whites, and in turmoil With hostile blacks, out on a run Far west, beneath a Queensland sun, He who had once been known at Court And in the Clubs as “Cupid” Forte. No trace of ceremoniousness Retained he now, though none the less Was he a graceful well-bred host; But he was hearty in accost, And giving the Australian grip And good up-country fellowship As bushmen. Few books had he read, But good ones, and he truly said That he had mastered their contents. He'd sat in early parliaments, And by his fellows been esteemed, Though no great speaker, for he seemed To do his best for everyone, And always used a courteous tone; And when such crises came about As made men fear to speak, spoke out With simple sense, what others thought But how to best dissemble sought. Close to her husband sat his wife, Some years his junior in life, And with her hair scarce changed a whit Since they were wed. Yet shades would flit Across her bright plaits 'neath the sun, And grey hairs 'mid the gold were none. E'en yet one noted that she bore The same slim figure as of yore. And marked a majesty of gait Which had been grace at twenty-eight (The year her lord had crossed the foam To fetch her to his Austral home), And that her charms were scarce impaired. All of her children had been spared, And now were round her;—Margaret, The youngest, well-grown, but not yet Out of the shy and modest awe That urges childhood to withdraw Or hang its head in company. Dark-haired, with clear dark cheeks was she, And had beneath her brow such eyes As chained onlookers with surprise, So weirdly blue, and spiritual, And fathomless, were they withal. The eldest, Will, was huge of limb As was his Father, so like him That, had he worn a bearded chin, And had his grizzled hair, no twin Could have been closer. He had pulled In the great boat race, but had mulled His “little-go” (for he was bred At Cambridge), and could with his head Only remember points of sheep And racehorse pedigrees, and keep Note of his thousand kindly friends, And scraps of business odds and ends. In college days he was not wild, But merely boisterous. No child More simple, or more innocent Of sin, and guile, and blandishment. College had not unfitted him For station life, but it would seem Had given him fresh interest, And added, as it were, a zest, As if for real work his will Had a great vacuum to fill. He rode with fearless skill, and shot Like a backwoodsman, and feared not Into a swamp neck-deep to wade When he a mob of ducks waylaid, Or crawl on belly through a sedge Hissing with snakes, to reach its edge. He was as kind as he was brave, And with less pleasure took than gave; And, though he loved society And sports, he'd bid them all good-bye, And work for months upon the runs In Queensland, not like squatters' sons, As rich as he was, often do, But like a bushman staunch and true. He was beloved alike by men And women: once within his ken You could but love his simple soul. As far from him as pole from pole Was Phil (though upright, yet so far From the pure heart which like a star Shone through his brother's life), sunk down, As men of best intents must own They have, by striking out too deep, And, being then obliged to keep Head above water, clutching at Means they'd have shrunk from but for that. In person, rather short than tall, With the blue eyes that marked them all, And handsomer than Will, and more Like what his Father'd been of yore. He dressed much like an Englishman Of well-bred fashion, spick and span, In gloves and hats, and with his coats Well cut but not extreme, his boots The best that could be bought. He'd go To Melbourne oft as a wool show Or sale of stud sheep gave excuse, Stay at the Club a month, and use The hundred opportunities Showered by fashion's votaries Upon him (soon as they should chance To hear that he'd arrived), to dance And tennis. When he went, he stayed Beyond good resolutions made Ere starting; but still, conscience moved Him thus far, that, though much he loved Club life and town, he would not go Without excuse of sale or show. Will was the eldest, next came Phil, And then Elizabeth, called Lil, Partly to chime with “Phil” and “Will,” Partly from the Australian hate For homely names, like Jane and Kate, Mary and Sarah. They delight To verge upon the opposite, With Rubys, Hildas, Violets, Gladyses, Idas, and Jeannettes, Lorraines, and Pearls, and Isobels, And Harolds, Kenneths, Lionels. They'd had a fight that very day, Ere dinner had been cleared away, Over this much-vexed theme of names, The English urging ancient claims For Mary and its congeners, The colonists preferring theirs As nicer and more musical. And then, some one proposed that all In order should declare their own. And first came the Professor's, John, And then Miss Forte's, her name was Lil, And therefore was on their part still Said one side, but Elizabeth The other. Next was Lachlan Smith, A brisk young ‘wig’ from Temple Court, Ready to cut his mother short, And argue with her on his birth, Or any other thing on earth, Or out of it. Next him was Maud, Maud Morrison, whom men applaud As one of Melbourne's belles; next her, Will Forte; and next a character— A widow, exquisitely dressed (And not in widow's weeds), confessed A sorceress, although she lacked The charms of person which attract The passer-by: her Christian name Was Ida. She the gentle flame Had lit, 'twas rumoured, in the breast Of the ex-minister addressed As Chesterfield (a man with grace Of action and a pleasing face, Who sat on Mrs Forte's right hand), So exquisite was he, and bland In manner, letter, speech, and smile, But yet upright and without guile, Liked upon both sides of the House, For no attack on him could rouse His tongue to personalities Levelled against their enemies By M.P.'s in Assemblies new; A prepossessing man to view. One liked to meet his figure slim The more, the more one knew of him. Some wag, with envy half-concealed, Had christened him “The Chesterfield Of Melbourne,” and the soubriquet Had gradually made its way Into the press, society, And lastly his own family. The widow sat upon the right Of Mr Forte, and opposite Miss Ridley, the girls' governess (They were grown up, but kept her less As teacher than companion), fair, With smoothly plaited flaxen hair; A vicar's daughter from the north, Of a poor race of ancient birth. Next her was Phil, and next to him, Full woman, therefore not too slim, But with a form of slender grace, And with bright health writ on her face In rosy cheeks and clear brown skin, With grey eyes, classic nose and chin, And curly hair, cut short behind, Was Kit, a medley, both refined And fast in instinct, delicate In taste, but proof to bear her fate In sports and hardships masculine, Proud, and with courage leonine, Full of wit and good fellowship, And with the curved lines of her lip, As prone to melt in laughter, born Of pure fun, as to curl in scorn; Di. Vernon's rival in the chase, Queen of the men's hearts in the place And miles around, but far from love And wooing as the moon above, The chaste, cold planet. She would rove With horse or gun, the whole day long, A month with the same lover, strong In her robust celibacy, Brimming with grace, her voice and eye Full of bright mirth and happiness: But if her frankness made him press The claims of love, a soft firm voice, Half laugh, half anger, gave him choice Of instant change or banishment. As far as maiden may, she went As man meets man, and her delight Was so contagious that one might Mistake the light of smile and glance For sign of more significance. Dressed for the field, she wore a tweed Made jacket-fashion, short-skirted, Revealing all a slim arched foot Laced in a natty shooting boot, Replaced at early morn and night By low-heeled pump of leather bright. Full dressed she wore no jewellery, And went in for simplicity, With rich plain stuffs, good work and fit. Her father's station much of it Joined Mr Forte's, and rumour said That Phil, if he'd his way, would wed His handsome neighbour. A contrast Was Lil, whose girlhood stood aghast At Kit's rough sports and manner based On manly canons of good taste, Though she rode gracefully and well, Played tennis fairly, and could tell Of triumphs too. She was petite, With slender waist, and pretty feet In dainty Paris shoes, and dressed In stuffs and fashions daintiest. Her clear skin was of the warm hue That marks the south, and o'er it grew In wavy clusters the fair hair Of Gothic ancestry; a pair Of liquid eyes spoke gentleness, A heart most kindly to distress, Most tender when besieged by love, And true to home though it might rove. Gracefully danced she, lightly swayed, And tastefully the keys she played, Whether for Lied of Mendelssohn Or new waltz she was called upon. She'd a smooth voice but did not sing, Most prudently considering That one more poor executante Could not be called a social want. She'd not, her lovers must confess, The noble, queenly loveliness And rosy health that Kit could boast, But the soft charms which we accost Sooner and guard more tenderly, The suppliant hand, the wistful eye, The pleading voice, the tender mien; Nor had she the robust and keen Brain of the other, but her mind Was healthy and enough refined To glean some joy from books and art, And the æsthetic tastes which part The cultured from the common herd. On Kit's left sat, without a word, But with a shrewd wink in his eye, Which shewed that, opportunity Requiring, he his views could state, If not with fluency, with weight, A stalwart man, with crisp bleached beard And sunburnt face, with both hands seared By scars and stains, and legs much bowed, As if he far and often rode: His name was Albert Hall, his seat Was next to blue-eyed Margaret: Beyond was Chesterfield, who said That he was Launcelot: at the head Sat Helen, handsome Mrs Forte, Her lord was Charlie. In the sport Which followed, parties differed not On Lachlan, Ida, Launcelot, Albert and Maud, but each side sought To reckon Helen and Margaret, These since in Scottish homes they'd met Helens and Maggies everywhere, And those because the names were fair And fanciful. Debate ran high Between the rivals as to why One chose names in so high a strain, And one so simple and so plain. None could convince and none would yield, So they referred to Chesterfield, Who appositely answered thus: “If you reflect, it's obvious Why Cobhams, who have lived in Kent For centuries, should be content, Age after age, to call a son By the ancestral name of John. But why my sire, who did not know His own grandfather, should do so, He failed to see, and therefore chose, As I have reason to suppose, What doubtless he esteemed to be The name of names, and christened me After his favourite Launcelot. And so both sides can urge somewhat, You with the humble name of John Remembering that you're the son Of twenty in succession, Traced with all due minutiæ Upon a parchment pedigree, While I, named after Arthur's knight, Call to my mind the legends bright About him, caring nought because I don't know who my grandsire was.” His answer met with much applause, But not with Lachlan Smith's—the jest, At himself aimed by Launcelot, pressed Harder on him, being the son Of storekeepers at Flemington, And striving to conceal his birth, By all the Lachlans of the earth Being claimed as his affinities. Nor did it altogether please Maud, though she could evince at once, By claiming all the Morrisons As kinsfolk, that his satire sly Did not in her own case apply. But Smith was one who well deserved All his success. He never swerved From his high purpose, and his rise Was due entirely to his wise Exertions and abilities. A state-school boy, he had obtained Grammar school scholarships, then gained A college bursary and high Distinctions as each year went by While at the University. Called to the Bar then, he had made His way by hard work undismayed. Too shallow and self-satisfied, Like many self-raised men untried With educations of a zone More cultivated than their own, He was, but, all things said and done, Praiseworthy. Contrast could be none Greater than was between this one And Cobham, the Oxonian, In every sense a gentleman, Man of the world and scholar, tall, Of lithe build, and symmetrical, With well-shaped head well set upon Square shoulders, clean shaved face whereon Was no hair save the black moustache, With eyes that seemed to cloud or flash With ev'ry thought. His hair was grey, And had been silvered many a day, Though he was still young and no care Or grief had fallen to his share. He had a certain easy grace In each expression of his face And motion of his body, voice Alluring, power to rejoice In diverse objects marvellous. Science, the beauties various Of Nature, Art, Society (The pleasure-seeking and the high), And sports of active exercise, Fair women and grand enterprise, All had their charms for him: he'd come To his professorship from home, And Chesterfield had taken him To set him in the social swim, And these last hospitalities Were due to his good offices, And he had come himself to make The week go well for Cobham's sake. 'Twas Christmas-eve, and they sat round Th' hearth filled with wattlebloom still found On stray trees, and with Christmas-Bush From New South Wales, and Bottle-Brush, And snowy spikes of bayonet grass, And treefern fronds and Sassafras. After dessert on summer nights, Those who stayed in to have the lights For work or reading used the hall, Being the coolest room of all, Tiled, and with many openings And passages to rooms and wings; But most went out, the men to smoke In the Verandah, women folk To hear the words of wisdom come From them in intervals of fume. However, being Christmas eve They all were in the hall, to give The night its due, with raisins snapped Out of the burning brandy, capped With dance and bumper of champagne. But first they talked in idle strain, And lounged about as people do An after dinner hour or two, And sat down, one by one, around Where in the winter warmth was found, And all with empty hands, save one Who skimmed through the Decameron. “What's the book, Chesterfield?” cried Will. “Boccaccio,” he said. Then Lil, “Who or what was Boccaccio?” Whom the Professor answered, “Know That some five hundred years ago To northern Italy there came A deadly pestilence, the same As England christened the Black Death, And to escape its mortal breath From Florence fled three noblemen, And seven ladies fair. The ten Beguiled the tedium of their stay By choosing from themselves each day A king or queen of sports; each told Each day a story new or old Worth telling, till ten days were o'er, And then to Florence turned once more.” “Famous,” cried Lil, “why should not we Have a Decameron? But you see,” She added, “There are fourteen here And eight days: that would interfere With having kings and queens: and I And Madge—why, half the family Could not tell tales.” Said Chesterfield, To whom they for advice appealed, “We could not—all of you must own— Well stomach a Decameron, But I have a proposal . . .” Each Cried “Listen,” while he made his speech. He said, “To tell ten tales a day Would take our time too much away, And half of us would be too shy Their skill in telling tales to try, And some might fail: so I suggest That the professor should be pressed To be the spokesman every night, And we draw lots to have the right To choose the subject—none choose twice.” And all agreed to his advice. And as for dance or snapdragon Or toasts 'twas early yet, some one Begged that he should begin at once, And drew to see who for the nonce Should be the King or Queen. It fell To Mrs Forte, who bade him tell Of fair wife loving husband well. Then he, “It seems that my consent Has been presumed: but while content To do your will, I claim your grace Where'er my tale exhibits trace Of inconsistency in work, Being extempore. The Turk, Or rather Arab, by your leave My subject of to-night shall give. SAIDA, THE BELOVED OF THE CALIPH. Haroun Al Raschid, it is said, Was in his palace at Baghdad, Sitting one summer day at noon, And ready with the heat to swoon; When in the dusty shadeless square He spied an Arab drawing near, Jaded, and limping sore, and wan. And when the Caliph looked thereon, And saw him toiling up the road, He cried out, “Hath Almighty God, Ever since heaven and earth began, Made such a wholly wretched man As this who drags his blistered feet At such an hour up the scorched street?” And, turning to the vizier, He bade that if the traveller Craved audience with him that day, He should be brought to him straightway. And so it fell out as he thought, And the poor man to him was brought, And, supplicating much, began To make complaint against Merwan— Who, at Medina's holy gate, Gave justice for the Caliphate. “Commander of the Faithful, I— Now eaten by calamity— Was once of all men happiest, With a fair wife and loving blest, And a young camel trained, whereby Our food and raiment to supply: But one by one misfortunes came, And false friends fell of, as the flame Dies when the substance of the wood Is into empty ash subdued; And last of all came my wife's sire, And, with well simulated ire, Snatched my last treasure from me too. And so I took my staff, and drew To Merwan, our lord Governor, And made complaint with groanings sore: Who at the first lent ready ear, And bade mine enemy appear; Who, when he came, with lying word, Cried that of her own free accord She had left me and sought her home, And that when, after I had come To crave her to return to me, She had entreated him that he Would not allow her to be led Back to the loathsomeness she fled. So that I, fearing that his tale Would with the Governor prevail, Asked whether, if my wife were brought Before him, and herself besought To be restored to me once more, He would compel them to restore: Who answered that it should be so, And bade mine adversary go And bring the woman to his seat, That he might judge her as was meet— Who, coming back, with him did bring My wife, shamefaced and quivering. And she, when bidden to declare Which of us two the truth did swear, Spake up for me in such a wise That Merwan—fain with his own eyes To see the woman, who could say That which he would in such a way— Bade her uncover in that place, And show the fashon of her face. And she did so with shame and wince, And he—whereas a minute since He had adjudged her mine—perforce Now made me crave him for divorce, And took my wife to be his bride. And therefore, weary and red-eyed, In the mid-heat of a noonday I drag my swollen feet, to lay Suit for redress at thy divan, And justice on the lord Merwan.” Nor did he sue without avail— For when the Caliph heard his tale Dark grew his eyeballs, and he sent Letters of passionate intent That bade Merwan give back the wife, If he set any worth on life, Or, by the Prophet's holy beard, And by the sepulchre revered, His headless body should be meat For dogs and vultures in the street. Then Merwan, as the Caliph bade, Did send the woman to Baghdad. And sent before her couriers, Bearing such words as these, in verse:— “Commander of the Faithful, I Bend low to thine authority. This Arab came to me to crave Justice: and ready ear I gave, As might beseem the judge who stands To execute thy just commands. He said that when prosperity Had run ahead and passed him by, The father of his wife had come And haled her back to her old home, And kept her there in his despite, And prayed that I would do him right. I, willing to do what was meet, Called forthwith to the judgment seat The wrong-doer, who, when he came, And heard the count, denied the same, Asserting that his child had fled For succour, and yet lived in dread Of being forced to dwell again With the most hateful of all men. Whereat the suppliant craved that I Would have her brought to make reply, And if so 'twere that she, when brought, To be restored to him, besought, That I would bid her sire restore The woman unto him once more. And they returned in no long time With one who seemed in the young prime Of comely graceful womanhood, Out of whose close-drawn veil there glowed Two eyes that shot a mingled flame Of sorrow, love, surprise and shame; Who, when I bade her to declare Which of the twain the truth did swear, Spake for her lord in such a wise That I was fain with mine own eyes To see the fashioning of face And somewhat further of the grace Of this wise woman, who could say That which she would in such a way, And bade her draw her veil aside: Whereat with shame the ruddy tide Filled all the fairness of her cheeks, And mid the shamefacedness that speaks Of gentleness and modesty, With trembling touch, she did comply, And stood before my greedy eyes A houri out of paradise, Unmatched for soft alluring grace. My heart leapt from me in that place To touch the lips that could confess With such sweet wisdom her distress, And to be lord of her whose love Misfortunes only helped to prove, And with persuasion did enforce Her husband to obtain divorce, And had the woman to my heart, The which she took in loving part Until thy firman came to me. Her to this end I send to thee, That thou may'st look on her and know What gifts hath Allah to bestow On woman if he mindeth to. Nor do I think that, when thine eyes Have looked on her, thou wilt despise Thy servant for what he hath done, But that thou'lt take her for thine own Unto the grand Seraglio Whereby the Tigris' waters flow.” Whereat the Caliph chafed again, And cried, “This shameless one of men Shall die the death who first deprives My faithful Arabs of their wives, And afterward accuseth me, Saying that I have but to see Her who hath brought about his blame And that my sin will be the same;” Then, turning to his vizier, bade Bring forward him who sought his aid, And said, “Thy wife to-day hath come, And thou shalt have her to thine home; But stay thou until first I see What manner of woman this may be Who speaketh with such honied lips, And whose eyes' magic doth eclipse The magic of all eyes in glance, Of which Merwan hath cognizance. And then do thou and she depart Whereso on earth it likes thy heart.” Now she, for all her late resort With Merwan at Medina's court, Was as shamefaced and full of dread When to the Caliph she was led, And bidden to unveil her head, As she had been when she was brought To Merwan's palace and besought; And, when before the throne, she stood In all her peerless womanhood, As beautiful as Ayesha, Upon whose fragrant bosom lay The prophet's cheek in happy hours, And whose fair hands, like lily flowers, Were wreathed about his dying head, Or Zeineb who was wife of Zeid, Or Mary the Egyptian, While down her face a tear there ran, As pure as Zemzem's sacred spring, From eyes, like dog's eyes, questioning What was the feeling and intent Of those whose gaze on her was bent Whether it boded good or ill. Meanwhile the Caliph drank his fill Of this love-potion, and did muse If he might not e'en now refuse The boon he gave a moment since, And yet do nothing that a prince Who loved his people might not do. And seemed it that, if it were so That he might win the man's consent With princely presents well content, There should be little harm though he Kept back the houri-eyed to be A crown of loving to his life. Natheless the Arab loved his wife So graciously that for her sake, Though beggared, he was loath to take Three virgins, fair as the full moon, And each of them as portion Having a thousand gold dinars, And for himself in the bazaars To have all men bow low to him, With downcast eyes and bended limb, Like a great officer of state, And to take from the Caliphate Much gold and raiment by the year, But answer made with many a tear, “Caliph of Islam, I indeed Came to thee in my utmost need To claim thy hand's protection Against the arm of Hakam's son: But lo, thy little finger is Thicker than Merwan's loin, I wis, Nor do I know to whom to turn For aid against thy purpose stern. Take back thy gifts—I heed them not, Though poor and painful be my lot; I would not change my low estate To have the very Caliphate, If to have it were to lose her.” The Caliph said, “Thou didst aver That thou hadst put her from thy breast, And Merwan's letter hath confessed That he hath also done likewise. How was she pleasing in thine eyes Whom thou didst put away from thee? Now shall she choose between us three, Thyself, and Hakam's son, and me: If she choose thee, she shall be thine, And, if she choose thee not, be mine. Dost thou agree?” The Arab bowed, And straight the Caliph cried aloud, “Say, Saida, whether wilt thou wed The Sheik of Islam to thy bed, Who sits upon the Prophet's seat, With all the nations at his feet, And dwells in golden palaces, And hath great realms and satrapies, And slaves, and riches, and empire, And can give all thou canst desire? Or wilt thou have the lord Merwan, That tyrannous and wrongful man, Who loveth thee so well, forsooth, That the poor lover of thy youth, Was driven, and constrained, perforce, To sue unto him for divorce? Or wilt thou have this wretched one, Who hath not to his portion, Save hunger and, her mother, need?” “By Allah,” she replied, “indeed, Caliph of Islam, know that I Do not desert when night is nigh Those, whom I love in the broad day, Because the sunshine sinks away; Nor do I change as the times do, And, when the summer flies, fly too; Nor can I easily forget That I have been his amulet And ewe-lamb, from the very first; Nor are our old love-bonds yet burst, That have grown like an ivy stem, As year by year passed over them. O Sir, should I not bear with him, Now that the nights are wild and dim, Who have with him lived cloudless days, When he basked in the spring sun's rays. It is the common way of men, Like deer who dwell upon the plain, While the sun shines, and peace is there, To browse together free from care, But when the wolves come with the night To forget all things in their fright, And each cry, “Save himself who can.” As with the deer, so with the man. But woman is not ever so; Her love shines with as pure a glow Right through the darkness, mist, and spray, As the North star which guides the way Of mariners on unknown seas. “O Caliph, I am such as these, And rather had I starve and die With yon poor Arab, miserably, Than share the grandeur of thy court, Or with the base Merwan consort.” Haroun saluted as Al Raschid, Caliph of Islam, the Abbassid, Who sate upon the Prophet's seat, And had the nations at his feet, And dwelt in golden palaces, Had seldom such reply as this, And greatly doubted if his ear Retained the faculty to hear, But to his royal word adhered And swore that, by the Prophet's beard, Even so he would, and more also, Unto the son of Hakam do If ever afterward he pressed This Saida from her Arab's breast, And gave him charge to use his power For their well-faring from that hour. The Caliph Haroun Al Raschid Many a deed of bloodshed did, And many evil works wrought he; But this good shall remembered be How that he kept his royal word In giving Saida to her lord. He ceased: and when th' applause was hushed Which hailed his effort, somewhat flushed At having stepped into the breach With even this small maiden speech, “Thank you, Professor,” Helen said, “For the grand way in which you've pled For women. If we have one claim Unquestioned to heroic fame, It is that we pause not to test Whether our idol be the best Of gold, or merely common clay, And scorn with scales its worth to weigh. Your shaft struck where you took not aim, For ere to this bright land I came I was betrothed for ten whole years Of trials, disappointments, fears And . . .” “Now wife no tales out of school!” “And I was laughed at for a fool For holding true so many a day To one twelve thousand miles away. And you, with your pretended frowns, Were, on the day you left the Downs, No great catch for a girl who weighed The value of the match she made; And I had suitors in my youth, Instance your brother, who in truth Were much to be preferred to you, By one who took the worldly view. For you were but a younger son, Starting to try a backblock run In Queensland, but (don't frown at me) I always fancied you to be A higher being, quite above All human standards except love.” When she had finished her romance Will pushed the chairs back for a dance, And Mrs Forte sat down and played Waltz after waltz, in long cascade, With the well-modulated touch Of one who had herself danced much. All danced but Mr Forte, and Kit Who would not dance, esteeming it Effeminate for one who tried To break the social fetters, tied Round the weak hands of maid and wife, And share the liberty and life Which men usurp: and this though she Could, when she chose, dance faultlessly With the proud pose and noble air So enviable and so rare. Waltz after waltz Maud danced with Phil, Because the Oxford man and Will, Although they both danced fairly well, In the last step did not excel, And Chesterfield could only do The deux-temps. Lachlan Smith, 'twas true, Could dance the new step, but then he In ease and poise failed woefully, Although he pleased himself: and Hall Could not be said to dance at all, Although he briskly twisted round His victims, whom he mostly found In bashful, blue-eyed Margaret (Who had not very often yet Tried in society the steps She did so well with Meinherr Kreps, Who trained most Melbourne ladies' schools In dancing and deportment's rules), And Mary Ridley, who had come From a strict-low-church vicar's home, Where dancing was esteemed a sin, And stimulant as bad as gin. Kind-hearted Will danced turn about With Madge, who, having not come out, And being shy and scarce full grown, Might have been too much left alone, And with his sisters' governess, As chosen by the others less, And Ida Lewis, who could dance Only deux-temps (the step in France When she was there at school, she said, Which, if she spoke correctly, made Her sweet and thirty). Lastly, Lil Won praise from even captious Phil, So perfect in her steps was she, In pose so upright and so free, And yet so yielding and so light. Maud Morrison perhaps was quite Her equal in mere stepping skill, But lacked the gentle grace of Lil. With Maud first the Professor danced, Who was not much thereby advanced In his good graces: she in fact Repelled him with a want of tact. The next he danced with Margaret, Who started the new step, but yet Adapted her step easily To his, when she perceived that he Preferred the trois temps, though to all His efforts conversational On twenty topics she replied Laconically: then he tried Miss Ridley, who displayed no ease And little grace, and by degrees Fell out of step; and then he walked To where Kit Johnstone stood and talked For half-an-hour, revelling In her bright chat, and noticing The shades of humour which gave chase One to another o'er her face. He did not dare ask Lil to dance, Though he stole many a longing glance, As round and round she floated by On her light feet so gracefully In the new step,—Maud Morrison Had been so galling in her tone, Because he danced trois temps, and she Danced not her steps so daintily As Lil: and so he stood with Kit, Half satisfied with her arch wit, Half taking his faint heart to task That what he wished he dared not ask. But as they talked Lil came and cried, “Professor, dance with me, you've tried, With all the others. I can do Your step, for I was watching you When you were with Maud Morrison, And if I fail, why no harm's done.” And then they started, and he thought That he till then had never caught The perfect luxury and grace Of waltzing: so exact each pace Fell into unison with his, So full of subtle witcheries Was the light form within his grasp, So hearty-innocent the clasp Of the small thrilling fingers thrust Within his in such perfect trust. And when at last the music ceased, She thanked him with a smile as pleased As if the honours of it lay With him, not her, then led the way To a broad lounge which stood before The opening of the boudoir door, Inside, and, making room for him, Crossed on a stool her ankles slim, And, leaning back, talked softly on, How she'd enjoyed the dance just done, And begged him once again to tell The tale he'd lately told so well. 'Twas rather Lily's way to form Quite suddenly attachments warm, And, when she did so, all her grace And tenderness and pretty face Were requisitioned to advance Development of her romance. She was so lovingly inclined, And so romantic in her mind, That she had aye some idol shrined And pedestalled within her heart, And, when with one compelled to part, Was hungry-souled and ill at rest Till she was once again possessed: Thus fiercely her hot southern blood Strove with the cold of maidenhood. She was a very child of love, So marvellously could she move, With glance and finger, thrill and voice, All men, who met her, to rejoice. She looked so full back to their eyes, She clasped their hand in such a wise, Her tones were pitched so sweet and low That all she told them seemed as though There were some special confidence. And yet 'twas all in innocence And worship. The professor came Just in the nick of time: the flame Of the last love was hardly quenched, And no new fetters had been clenched, And he precisely was the man Most likely to create and fan The ‘sacred fire’ within her breast, Being at once the cleverest And one of the best-looking men Who'd ever come into her ken. He dressed well, talked well, played at games Well enough to support his claims With most chance rivals, had a name For books and scholarship, and came Of ancient lineage. She fell Into this new magician's spell As soon as she had heard him tell The legend about Saida, So tenderly did he pourtray A loving woman's constancy And modest girl's timidity, That seemed it that who thus could tell Of woman's heart must know it well, And set her longing to find out What tenderness there was about His own heart. Thus these two sat on, And she asked many a question About this Saida. But he Knew nothing of her history, Save that he'd read in volumes old The outline of the tale he told. She asked him if he cared again To dance, and in condoling strain Listened to the delinquencies Of scornful Maud, and said that his Was one of the most pleasant steps She ever danced to, that Herr Kreps Had said the “trois temps” was the best Of all waltz steps—and all the rest Which sympathetic girls do say When they are carried right away With championing some pet cause, As ardent Lily just then was. Their confidences were cut short By a stern summons to the sport Of snapping dragons from a dish, With blazing brandy devilish, Followed by bumpers of champagne To welcome Christmas back again. And ere they parted, after they Had wished a Merry Christmas-day And many of them, each to each, The kind host made a short neat speech: “Welcome to Waratah, young men, Look to the ladies first, and then Do all that in your pow'r you can To show our guest, the Englishman, The pleasures with which station-life Can be in holidays made rife. He entertains us every night, So it is only fair and right That we should show him all we may Of our life and its joys by day.” Christmas Day, December 25th. Waratah breakfasts were at nine: Lil was down first and looked divine In a fresh, simple, morning dress Of gossamer, with snowiness Unbroken save by sash pale blue Wound round her, and a spray or two Of the wild brook forget-me-not Pinned in a cluster at her throat. The others followed. One could see Who were for church quite easily Without appealing to the vote. Old Mr Forte in his frock coat And Chesterfield looked most devout: Maud Morrison was much decked out, And Mrs Forte wore rich black silk, Margaret ‘Surah,’ white as milk, Miss Ridley her best summer white, While the Professor came down dight In Paget suit of iron-grey twill And stiff white waistcoat. Only Lil Was neutral. Kit was careless in A Norfolk jacket masculine, And Phil and Will wore old tweed clothes, Which told as plainly as would oaths How much church service they would hear, And Hall replied with prompt “No fear,” When he was challenged. Lachlan Smith Was down too late, and Ida with An “I don't think I'll go to-day,” Announced her wishes straight away. At half past ten the waggonette, In which old Mr Forte had met Professor Cobham, was brought round, When he to his surprise profound Perceived that though a hot wind blew (The Fahrenheit marked 92° With most oppressive sultriness, Lil had exchanged her cool white dress For a black silk with pannier And flounce, and other heavy gear, And long tight gloves—such sacrifice Will women make to touches nice. She certainly looked very well, And what the vulgar call ‘a swell,’ But not so graceful or so bright As in her simple dress of white. However it would not have done For younger sisters to have gone Much dressed, while elder went arrayed In simple fabrics simply made. The gentlemen left in the lurch (For want of space) all walked to church, A pretty little bluestone pile Which Mr Forte had built, with aisle And nave and chancel. It was decked, With some fair notion of effect, By Lil, and Maud, and Margaret. The hymns to pretty tunes were set, But like the sermon ill-prepared: The gossips of the township stared, As village gossips always will, At Mrs Forte, and Maud, and Lil, To criticize their looks and dress, And comment on their ugliness: And then the plate went round, and then They shook hands and drove home again, Along a heavy, sandy road, While overhead a fierce sun glowed, And the north wind with sudden gust Caught up and eddied clouds of dust. Arrived at home they came on Will, And Kit, and Lachlan Smith, and Phil, On sundry sofas lying prone, And reading newspapers, alone, In sheer disgust because the day Was far too hot for tennis play. Kit decked for dinner in a dress, Cut with a habit's simpleness, Made of black velvet, Will and Phil In their old tweed shell jackets still. The Christmas dinner was at two, And all that wealth or pains could do Was done to make it a success, And marks of female tastefulness And traces of a lady's care Were noticeable everywhere. The port was old, the champagne dry, And ev'ry kind of luxury Which Melbourne could supply was there. They had the staple Christmas fare, Roast beef and turkey (this was wild), Mince pies, plum pudding, rich and mild, One for the ladies, one designed For Mr Forte's severer mind, Were on the board. Yet in a way It did not seem like Christmas day, With no gigantic beech Yule-logs Blazing between the brass fire dogs, And with 100° in the shade On the thermometer displayed. Nor were there Christmas offerings Of tasteful inexpensive things, Like those which one in England sends At Christmas to his kin and friends, Though the professor with him took A present of a recent book For Lil, and Madge, and Mrs Forte, And though a card of some new sort Had been arranged by Lil to face, At breakfast, everybody's place. When dinner ended, nearly all Stole off to have a snooze or sprawl Upon the lounges in the hall. The heat was too oppressive still For outdoor exercise, but Will Went out to give his dogs a run In a plantation where the sun And wind were broken by the trees. And Kit, who bore the heat with ease, Challenged Professor Cobham's skill At billiards; Hall, and Smith, and Phil, Lazily blowing clouds of smoke, And criticising every stroke. Each of the players much surprised The other,—Kit had not surmised That the professor's play would show Such mastery of “running through,” So quick an eye and sure a hand, Nor he that she had such command Of check and screw, and would display So much sound judgment in her play. And so the long close afternoon To its late end dragged slowly on, Without a breeze from morn to eve The suffocation to relieve. Sunset just took away the glare But did not cool the heat-charged air, And everybody in the house Was glad when tea-time came to rouse Their languid torpor and despair. Tea over, no one seemed to care To face the hothouse atmosphere Of the verandah, but drew near To listen to Lord Chesterfield And the Professor, who distilled The pith of Schliemann's ponderous And formidable “Ilios;” Holding the book up in his hand To illustrate as he explained That those who heard might understand A heavy subject, at the best By no means easy to invest With any human interest, A fact which was not lost on Kit, Who hinted with her ready wit That she would like it just as well If he would close the book, and tell Homeric tales, and make them rife With touches of the old Greek life As painted by the bard. “You can Bear out or quarrel with Schliemann By following his theories Or choosing those which he denies, And we shall have our tale, and learn Greek habits without study stern.” The rest her action ratified, And, as a subject she'd supplied, Declared her Queen without resort To Justice Ballot-box's Court. ODYSSEUS IN SCHERIA. From the first shimmer of the summer-morn Upon the breeze's wings had there been borne Such echoes as are heard about a quay When a great ship is putting out to sea; And all day long down to the port had rolled A stream of men bearing great store of gold, And broidered raiment, swords with studded hafts, And brazen vessels, fair as that which wafts The incense-smoke from Delphi, and bright arms Such as make manly men in war's alarms. And King Alcinoüs stood upon the deck Watching the lading, lest the crates should check The crew in reaching forward with their oars To waft Odysseus to the longed-for shores. And then he turned home, meaning with high feast To celebrate the parting of his guest, And slew an ox to the cloud-gatherer Zeus. Then those who in the palace had their use, Roasted the thighs, and therewith made much mirth, And, when they were well feasted, summoned forth The gifted bard who pleased the multitude, And by them was much honoured; who renewed A lay half sung upon an earlier day That had pleased well. And when that it was gay Loud shouts of laughter through the courtyard rang: But when the deaths of island chiefs he sang, And island queens with thongs bound round their hands, Driven with blows and shame to hostile lands, The laughter died away and eyes grew dim. Such mastery of song was there in him. But one there sate, unchanging with the song, And little noting aught, but all day long Gazing with levelled glances at the west To see the sun's tired horses sink to rest Behind the hill of ocean. For his cause The sacrifice and song and feasting was; And yet he heeded to them least of all Who were within Alcinoüs' palace-wall. For he was thinking how that he should come With no long-waiting to his island-home, And queen and son, and flocks and herds and stead, And whether he should find Laertes dead; Or that the Theban's shade had told him truth; And in his mind viewed pictures of his youth, And the old life in Ithaca, before He followed the Atridae to the war. No ploughman wearied by his clodded shoon. Towards the close of winter afternoon, Could look unto the setting of the sun With more of hope and welcome than this one. And lastly the sun set: and then he spake Unto the King, craving that he might take His escort and his treasures, and all things That the great gods, whose lot is above kings', Had vouchsafed to him, to the hollow ship. And then he spake, and this with trembling lip, Of her against whose pure and wifely name Envy itself had never whispered blame, While she spun on through twenty widowed years, And nightly washed her spinning out in tears. And then he spake the word which those who rove On pathless seas and sands, and exiles love— “Home:” and then prayed that fair days should befall His kindly host—good cheer within his hall, Chaste wives and goodly children; and then prayed The God, who ever makes it his to aid The suppliant and stranger, to rain down All manner of good gifts upon this town, And that no ill should come unto its folk And take abode with them. And while he spoke There was a hum of praise, and when he made An end of speaking, all with one mind bade That he should have his ship; nor did the King Dissent from what they willed, but, summoning Pontonöus, the herald, bade him pour Into the mystic graven bowl great store Of sacred wine, and all the heroes call Into the lofty roofed, bronze-paven hall, That they might pray Zeus with a shielding hand To bring the stranger to his fatherland. And so it was—Pontonöus filled the bowl With wine that soothed the sorrows of the soul, And gave to each in order as they sate. Who to the gods, that hold their solemn state On the broad hill of heaven, duly poured The first drops in libation, and implored Safe conduct for the guest. But he stood up And set in the Queen's hand a drinking cup With double bowls set base to base, one full And crowned with wreathing flow'rs and snowy wool, And spake therewith such wingèd words to her— “O Queen, I pray the gods to give thee cheer, Until the fair day when old age and death Come, as they come to all who draw our breath. Nor do I think that age will come alone; For unto me thou seemest such an one As are the blessed gods who wax not old. And, but that I by Pallas had been told, I had thought thee immortal, as they be. Now I am going home. Zeus prosper thee, And leave thee long to have thy full delight In King Alcinöus' heroic might, And all thy children and the men, who love, With oars too great for other folk, to rove Over the open sea (whose waters shine As darkly and as clearly as the wine Crushed in the islands from the purple grape), Delighting all these with thy queenly shape And godlike wisdom.” And therewith he passed Over the threshold of the doorway vast, Led by the royal Herald to the quay, Whereby the ship rode chafing for the sea, And went aboard. And the Queen's womenfolk Brought him from her fair linen and a cloke Fresh-washed but now, and the strong coffer faced With plated bronze whereon Odysseus placed A magic lock, which sunborn Circe wrought, And with self-working understanding fraught; Wherein were stored the princes' goodly gifts, The talents of pure gold, the thirteen shifts Of royal vesture, and the noble sword Which Sir Euryalus brought forth from his hoard Partly to do the bidding of the King, And partly as his own free offering, To soothe away the bitter words he spake; Goodly the weapon, and of wondrous make, With biting blade and sheath of ivory, Carven with curious myths of days gone by, And silver studded hilt. And there, too, lay The wine bowl that Pontonöus yesterday, And many a year before, had daily filled With the sweet grape juice, when Alcinöus willed To pour libations. This the King had given That whensoe'er Odysseus looked to heaven, Sitting at sacred feast, he might recall The lofty-roofed, bronze-paved, Phaeacian hall And him who sate within it on his throne. Made all of gold it was, with handles on, And with a wreath of leaves of beaten gold, And mingled golden roses round it rolled. And others bare him ruddy wine and wheat; And when all things were brought, there sate at meat Odysseus and the escort that he had; And, when all were with banqueting full glad, Down in the hollow of the ship they made Well in the stern a bed, and thereon laid Soft cloths of wool and linen, that he might Rest easy mid the rockings of the night. And then with sound of flutes and many a shout They from the capstan paid the cables out Which moored the ship alongside of the quay, And cast her out into the stream; and she, Unlike man's ship slow forging at the start, Leapt straightway into swiftness like a hart, Or like a four-horse chariot in the ring, Or hawk that cleaves the wind on lightning wing. And then with more of music and glad noise (The while the seamen did the mainsail hoise) The heralds took their way back to the house, And mingled with the heroes in carouse. But on the seashore, all alone, stood one Who, with strained eyeballs, through the twilight dun Scanned the dim form of the departing ship Not without lashes moist and quivering lip; A maiden with her girlhood scarce outgrown, Tall and still slender, with her brown hair done Into a plaited coil, and with grey eyes That had the clearness of the summer skies, And something of their colour; her soft cheeks Were tinted with the duskiness that speaks Of sunny playhours and warm southern blood, And yet when shame or dancing brought the flood Of crimson to her face, the glow shone through As fairly as through skins of fairer hue. Robed was she in soft white, with but a braid Of golden thread upon its border laid, And with gold bosses on her sandal thongs, And golden brooches with sharp pointed prongs Buckling her peplus. She gazed on the ship With moistened eyelashes and quivering lip, Not that it bore away her hopes; they had Been stricken over night, when all were glad With the saved stranger's story, as he told Of all his wars and perils manifold. For therein had he spoken of his quest To win to rocky Ithaca, and rest In the chaste arms of his enduring wife. And at that word there fell on her young life A shadow such as falls upon the eve, When the last glimmers of the sunset leave. And yet the best of the Phaeacian land, Great seamen, mighty chiefs, had sought her hand, And wooed her pleasure many a day in vain, And moved her not e'en so much as to pain In the refusal, but were ever met With a smooth, heedless smile and a “not yet.” Her wont and her delight had been to sport Among the maidens of her mother's court, At ball and dance, and music, and to play With her own brothers, passionless and gay, And light of heart, giving no thought at all Unto the lot that uses to befall King's daughters and fair women, as of fate, When they have come to womanly estate. And why should this man win so much on her? He looked not like a lady's courtier With his great shoulders, stoop, and weight of head That his low stature nowise warranted. Nor did he heed his person overmuch, But let the sun and sea and weather smutch His arms and face with brown, and let his hair And beard curl and run riot everywhere. Nor was he in the first prime of his age, Nor were the nice tricks of a palace page Observed in his grave manner and address; Though there could not but be some courtliness In one who had so much with outland men Mingled as suppliant or alien, Envoy or treaty-maker: nor had he, At least as from his speech might gathered be, Much heed for woman's beauty or fair ways, But, speaking no great matter in their praise, Dwelt much upon the palling of the love With which Calypso, in her island-grove Of poplar and sweet-scented cypress, strove To move him to forgetfulness of home; Love of a kind that surely would not come To all men thus unwelcomely, but most Would look upon it as the crown and boast Of all their lives, and not, as this strange man, Seek how he might by wile Dædalian And prayer, and by entreaty face to face, Win his way out from each delightful place To sail back to his rocky heritage And to a wife now well advanced in age— If she indeed yet lived, and had not gone To join the shades that flit about the throne Of gloomy Dis, and thirst for draughts of blood. Sated he seemed of all fair womanhood, As though the spring of worship and desire Had dried up in his veins, and all youth's fire Had burnt away. And he spake wearily Of pageants, revels, and court ceremony And even the nymphs' gardens of delight— Full of strange sweetnesses to charm the sight, And scent, and hearing of all mortal men Whom fate or some god brought within their ken. But when he spake of battles or of ships The whole man changed, and then from out his lips Poured such a stream of burning, speechful words That he who heard half saw the play of swords, The whirl of javelins, the dinted shields, The blood-drenched herbage of the battle-fields Rutted by wheels, and spattered up by hoofs, And strewn with garments slashed of divers woofs, And mangled limbs, and corpses, and dead steeds. Or if he did recount his mighty deeds On shipboard and his wondrous voyages To haunted isles and undiscovered seas, One seemed to hear the stormwind piping loud About the rigging, and each stay and shroud Groaning with ev'ry straining of the mast As the great sail bent it before the blast, And hear the ebb-wave rippling round the prow When the shipmen had anchored from the bow; To see strange shapes of trees with naked stems And cloud-high tops crested with diadems Of giant flow'rs, and fruits, and spiky leaves; And see vast serpents and wild, humpbacked beeves With manes like lions, and huge, fire-bright birds With monstrous bills that shrieked out sounds like words Or mocked with human laughter. And he told Of that which, neither beast nor fish, is rolled In armour of such proof as neither spear Nor sword can pierce and armed with triple tier Of jagged teeth, as great in length and mouth As are the dread sea monsters of the South. And then, perchance, of the dwarf, hairy men That lived in trees and spake not back again When they were hailed, but fled with savage screams Deeper into the forest, bridging streams With their own bodies linked by sorcery And cunningly swung over from a tree. These had he told and much more: and the maid Hung on his lips while he his tale displayed, Nor ought of the man saw she but did grow Into proportion. In his form did glow The ravager of Troy, the voyager, The nymphs' beloved, the Cyclops' vanquisher. And then her thoughts fell back and she built up The magic golden palaces of hope, Laid lately in the dust, of words of praise Breathed through a rain of kisses, and fair days Beside him in the lofty bronze-paved house, And great sons many wise and valorous Reflecting back their father's praise on her As he did on his mother. Then some cheer Came to her, calling back the gracious words He spake to her when the Phaeacian lords Had left them, giving her the thanks and love For his saved life. And then again she strove To unbuild the fabric gently, course by course, But fell to weeping tribute to remorse, And listening to the sad throb of the tide Until she wept to sleep by the seaside. The narrative was hardly o'er When all were startled by the roar Of thunder-claps right overhead, And by a lightning fork which shed A flash of light as broad as day Over the hall, with its clear ray Illuminating every nook, Leaving the ladies terror-struck, Excepting Mrs Forte, and Kit Who went outside to look at it. Peal after peal and flash on flash Seemed to portend the instant crash Of roof and chimney-stack and wall, And swift destruction to them all. But the Professor, who had gone Outside with Kit to look upon The glory of the storm, could see No shadow of anxiety Or fear upon her proud fair face When sometimes for a moment's space 'Twas lit with the electric gleam. Now meanwhile it began to seem To those inside in their suspense As if the atmosphere intense Would suffocate them even though They were not crushed at one fell blow, For not a single drop of rain Had fallen, though the hurricane Raged with such fierceness o'er the plain. But at the last, with rushing sound And dashing huge Gums to the ground, Came the rain squall through the tree tops, At first with huge infrequent drops, Then in a deluge pouring down Like waterfalls upon the crown Of mountain-gorges when the snow Beneath the sun's increasing glow Is melted on the Alpine peaks, While valiant Kit, whose rosy cheeks Had blenched not at the storm, was fain To flee in rout before the rain, Which gave way to an icy chill And hailstones huge enough to kill Such hapless bird or animal As in their path might chance to fall. Soon as the rain began to pour, The thunderstorm passed quickly o'er, And with it fled the stifling heat, Leaving the air quite fresh and sweet, Which tempted most of them to walk Out in the air to smoke or talk, All save the two old folks and Lil, Who made their hearts expand and thrill By playing snatches slow and clear Of carols they'd been used to hear Some half-a-century ago At High Wick Manor, when the two Were lad and maiden; they talked on Of England and what they had done On bygone Christmas nights at home, Of friends beyond the northern foam, And friends beyond that other sea Yet further—whither ceaselessly Travellers follow the old track, But whence no messenger comes back. Outside, the conversation turned On the same subject. Cobham learned That Chesterfield, although in truth Colonial-born, had passed his youth And boyhood in the mother-isle, Had been at Westminster awhile And Cambridge, which however he Had left too soon for a degree, And so the two had much to say About the good old English way Of keeping Christmas—carols, waits, Yule logs, a furbishing of skates, A hanging up of mistletoe O'er spots where everyone must go, And decorating church and house With holly, presents numerous, And Christmas-boxes, boxing-day, With opening theatres gay, And Twelfth-night with its “characters,” And Twelfth-cake. Kit to their converse Listened attentively, and walked In silence with them as they talked. She took uncommon interest In everything that was possessed Or done by England. Englishmen Of good position first, and then Great English ladies, habits, sport, And etiquette. Old Mr Forte Had been her chief authority, But he was half-a-century Behind the latest. Now she had One, not long since an undergrad. In a crack Oxford College, near To question on the social sphere Of English gentry. So these three, For half-an-hour it may be, Walked up and down, till Mr Forte Called the Professor to support Some view of English Christmastide, Which Mrs Forte and Lil denied; And there he stayed and talked at first With the old people till he durst Steal off to Lil, who sat alone At the piano, mute anon, Then symphonizing. She had been In the late elemental scene More terrified than all the rest, But Cobham in his heart confessed That on the whole he'd rather have A girl too timid than too brave, And that a gentle helplessness In petty cases of distress Affords a pretty patronage For ladies—to a certain age. His fancy certainly was struck More with Lil's terror than Kit's pluck. She looked so tender in her fright, With quivering lips and cheeks blenched white, And nervous hands clasped in dismay, While there was, as the Scots would say, A something unco' in the pride Which thus the elements defied, In one so young and exquisite In woman's beauty as was Kit. Boxing Day, December 26th. All the young folks on Boxing Day Were to go some ten miles away To races held at Linlithgow, A township with a hut or two, A state school and a public-house Of functions rather various, Post office, tavern, forge, and store. Will said at breakfast, “Four or more Will have to ride, the waggonette Although it's pretty roomy, yet Can't very well accommodate More than the luncheon-things and eight. Butters will ride on just ahead To let us through the gates, and spread The tablecloth and knives and forks, And open tins and draw the corks. Who is for riding?” “I,” said Phil, And Albert Hall and Kit and Lil, And the Professor, who confessed That his seat was not of the best, And asked to have a quiet horse. Will answered gracefully, “Of course I never give a horse that kicks Or ‘bucks’ or has uncertain tricks To any man until I ken How he can ride, and never then Unless he asks me, or we're short Of nags. I think the so-called sport Of putting new-chums on a brute That bucks is cowardice absolute. I don't think that we have a beast About the place that bucks the least, Except the grey Miss Johnstone picks. Lil's chestnut shies but never kicks.” The riders started none too soon At ten to reach the course by noon: The ride itself amidst the trees, Across bush paddocks, could but please. But three at least of the cortege Were chafing if not in a rage. Not the Professor and not Kit, Who rode exchanging shafts of wit, And making the whole forest ring With laughter blithe, or noticing The glory of the summer morn Through the thin gum-tree foliage borne, But Phil and Lil and Albert Hall Woefully disconcerted all At this unlooked-for partnership. Lil had looked forward to a trip With the Professor tête-à-tête, Knowing the admiration great Her brother Phil had always had For dashing Kit, since quite a lad, And that the bushman in his way Liked well enough with her to stay; And Phil and Hall had reckoned on Choosing their own companion. As Lil anticipated, they From the Professor held away, But then he was with Kit, not her, And Phil had not a character For taking disappointments well, And muttered hints about ‘a sell.’ And ladies Hall scarce understood Unless they sunk their womanhood In masculine proclivities. And so they rode in silence wise With ennui undiversified, Save when Lil's horse was scared and shied Because a wounded wallaby Sprung almost at its feet to fly. Her fearlessness and skill combined Astonished those who thought to find A timid rider in the form Which cringed so from the thunderstorm, And Cobham, as they rode behind, Revealed to Kit his puzzled mind. “Lil's a conundrum,” answered she, “She'll pick a snake up fearlessly To dash its head against a tree, And run in terror from a cow As tame as those we passed just now.” At length they rode up to the course, An unfenced clearing where a horse Could only know the track because 'Twas clear enough to let him pass. A few drink-shanties and a box Built for the judge of redgum blocks, With sundry poor time-honoured shows Alone beside the “paddock” rose To stamp the race-course. There were few Bookmakers, the bookmaking crew Flying at higher game elsewhere. The horsey, noisy talent here Was chiefly local. Then there were Owners of horses, stable boys And station-hands, who made much noise Of a good-humoured hearty sort, And shewed keen relish of the sport, But did not drink as people do In England, or “knock down their screw” For a whole year like those who've been On far-back stations Riverine. Being bred up a Londoner, Though he'd spent much of ev'ry year Out in the country, Cobham knew Little of horses but the two That brought her carriage every day To take his mother out, and they When they had brought her home at night Dropped as completely from his sight Until the morrow afternoon As if they stabled in the moon. And therefore he paid far more heed To lunch and lady than to steed, But not to Kit instinctively, For she had neither ear nor eye For anything but boy and horse When she was once upon the course, And was so far preoccupied As to let Phil usurp her side And feast his eyes upon her charms Without recourse to flight or arms. It was not altogether chance Or undesigned, the circumstance That in their morning gallop there Cobham had been Kit's cavalier, For Kit, as has been said above, Was a sworn Amazon, and love Was not a topic she'd endure From any man, nor was she sure, What Phil's precise intentions were. He certainly bestowed on her More of his company and care Than he was wont to give the fair, And she had seen him more than once Dart her a glance that might announce A state of feelings that would be Distasteful in the last degree, If he were to interpret it As seemed most likely to her wit. And if they'd ridden tête-à-tête, And then had chanced to separate From their companions as they rode Through the lone paddocks, with their blood Excited by the exercise And storm-cleared atmosphere, Phil's eyes, Might have been warmly seconded By words she'd rather keep unsaid, And so she had condemned poor Lil To penance between Hall and Phil. But Lil could have her full reward When they were once upon the sward, For the Professor, as was said, Had not been in the country bred, And about horses knowing naught Had not the interest he ought, And Lil, although she'd always been Much among horses, yet had seen So much of racing and the best That she took no great interest In a bush-meeting, unless one Of her friends' horses chanced to run, And then just for the minute's space Of the duration of the race. Besides she looked much prettier, As the Professor could aver, Than he had seen her look before, With a fresh rosy tint spread o'er Her cheek, which sometimes, he'd confess, Was just a shade too colourless. Then the swift motion through the air Had loosened a bright lock of hair, And as, if fault in her you'd find, She was a trifle too inclined To slenderness, a habit made Of soft grey “homespun” tweed displayed Her figure at its best—the fit Perfect enough for even Kit. Lunch was a feature of the day, Which Butters had been told to lay As soon as he had fastened up The nags and given them their sup. The three seats of the waggonette Could be detached, and they were set Beneath a shady wattle tree, So that each lady on her knee Could take her lunch conveniently. There was no lack of luxury, For turkey, chicken, duck, and pie, Were ranged before the luncher's eye, Flanked with peach-tart, Madeira cake, Plum pudding, shortbread (of Scotch make), And summer fruit and clotted cream, With champagne flowing in a stream Exhaustless. Soon the ladies went Satisfied to their heart's content, Leaving their cavaliers at ease To finish luncheon when they'd please. The gentlemen had ‘jolly fun,’ For they were hungry everyone And in high spirits. Chesterfield Had the consummate art, concealed Beneath his kindness, to appear Contented with whatever cheer Was set before him; honest Will, Child-like, loved any outing still; And the Professor, for his part, A boon companion was at heart. When they rejoined the ladies, he Helped Lil to mount, a mystery He did not clearly understand, But took her dainty foot in hand As cheerfully as if he knew Exactly what he ought to do. And then he mounted, and the two Rode slowly round, outside the course, Oblivious of friend or horse, Until the crowd that went away Proclaimed the finish of the day, When they resought their friends in time Not to be noticed much. To climb Unaided to her saddle took Kit scarce a moment, then she shook Her reins and cantered up to Lil And Cobham, leaving Hall and Phil To join the three or ride apart Just as it pleased them—in her heart Dreading a ride with Phil alone A good deal more than she had done Before he'd drunk so much champagne, And striven with his might and main To make her day enjoyable. She had not liked it half as well As she was wont, from constant care Lest he should take her unaware When none were near her, and intrude The question she would fain elude, Of which th' attentions he had paid Gave her fresh cause to be afraid. So she was forced for her own sake Lil's tête-à-tête once more to break, For, as she feared, esprit de corps Or dread of being deemed a bore Might make Hall spur his horse away, If he thought Phil had aught to say. However, Lily Forte and she Had wide enough diversity In character to be fast friends, And Kit strove hard to make amends For her intrusion by the will To set the Oxford man and Lil Each in the other's graces good, To take care that each understood The other's merits. They went home A good deal faster than they'd come, And soon had cantered into view Of Mr Forte's oak-avenue. Half way through dinner, Will had said That, if objection no one made, He voted that the tale should be In the Verandah, so that he And those who chose might have their smoke. And very sensibly he spoke, Since just as women like to sew When they have nothing much to do, But may not read or talk, so men For their cigar or pipe are fain. They did not draw the lots because It seemed too formal, but Lil was By common acclamation named Queen of the night, and, as such, claimed Another tale of old Greek lore, Such as he'd told the night before, And asked him, if he could, to say More of the sad Nausicäa. Accordingly th' Oxonian, Ere he the evening's tale began, Repeated to them a sad song That he had fancied for her tongue. THE SONG OF THE LOVE-SICK NAUSICAA. Doomed back again to the dull island life, To be at best the oft-neglected wife Of some sea-roving, rude Phaeacian. Nor shall I hear the breakers plash, nor scan One ship bound outwards in the twilight dim, Without a pang of longing after him. The island chiefs are seamen skilled and bold; But when their feats in sea-craft have been told, Their store of plundered wealth, their deeds of blood, And some strange ventures on the Libyan flood, There is not much made up unto their wives For the unending sameness of their lives. Had he but stayed, and had he not been wived, How happy in his wedlock had I lived, Watching him 'mid the heroes in the ring Foremost in every art that fits a king, And, when night drave us into the high hall, Hearing fair words from out his wise lips fall, Of how, beside their ships in front of Troy, The common round of gain and strife and joy For nine long years busied the Argive chiefs, Varied with skirmishes and some few griefs, As when a prince ventured in foraying Too far, and fell to Paris's bowstring: Then he would tell of that last crowning year When all things boded that the end drew near, Of Hector's death and Paris' poisoned wound, And how the kindly Menelaus found And took his fair wife to himself again; And lastly of his own hap on the main,— Of his escape from sunborn Circe's isle, And from divine Calypso's love and guile, Of Polyphemus and the Laestrygons, And of the Sirens and the whitening bones— His shipwreck, his stern struggle with the sea, And how that he looked lovingly on me From the first sight! How happy had I been If fate had given me to be his queen, To cherish him whose prudent counsels won The overthrow of godlike Ilion, Who hath been in his very miseries The love of nymphs and care of goddesses! But he hath passed away into the night, Lost to our vision like the goodly light. The light may come again on isle and sea, But never the same perfect light to me, In that my heart is darkened, and mine eyes Will all things through his image see, veil-wise. THE LEGEND OF HELEN AT SPARTA. Helen, the daughter of King Tyndareus, Or, as some say, of Ægis-bearing Zeus, Had lived in Sparta many a goodly day Ere the east wind blew down from Phrygia Paris the fair, and many days lived she In golden friendship free from taint, and free With Paris and her husband afterward, Until the son of Atreus went aboard His swift black ship and sailed to far-off isles, And there abode, leaving his wife long whiles With Priam's godlike son (whether it was By Aphrodite's lure, or for some cause Of high state-policy or gain, or both). The Queen to lose her lord was passing loath, And fell to weeping, till the Phrygian To soothe with words of comforting began, And then was so insistent, that he must Be as insistent to fulfil the trust Of cherishing the dame, which the Greek King Had laid upon his honour at parting, In nowise dreaming of the afterhap That Nemesis bare for him in her lap, But full of tenderness for the young wife Whom he was leaving, lest her daily life Should be a prey to loneliness and tears, And, as men oft in their preventing fears Prevent their hopes, so did the Spartan King. For, after the first days of sorrowing, Helen began to look with grateful eyes Upon his youth, who in such tender wise Had healed her sorrows, nor was gratitude Long ere it did descry in what it viewed Fair lineaments and princely qualities, Such as few men in any man despise, And least of all a woman, who has been Won by those very graces from her teen. And thus these two lived joyously each day, Wiling the swift-winged golden hours away, Charmed by each other's gifts, as by a spell. Helen, as woman, could but note too well Him unto whom her least wish was a care Like a behest from heaven, and compare The goodliness of shape, the fair bright hair, Fair face, swift feet, and skill in archery, Which made him with far-darting Phœbus vie, Against the simple worth of her own lord Who, in the melée staunch and staunch in word, Was yet none such as the Pergamian Prince, Nor in such courtier-fashion could evince The great, true love he bare her in his soul. And, as for Paris, how should he control His eyes from looking on the loveliness That with its presence all his days did bless And made his earth a heaven—not that he thought In those first days of doing wrong in aught Unto the son of Atreus; nor did he deem That such things would be. Nathless in a dream It seemed that Aphrodite to him came, And, garlanding a crown of amber flame Around the sleeping princess where she lay, Set him to thinking of that other day When he bestowed the apple upon her, And she on him had promised to confer The fairest of fair women on the earth, And set him thinking if for grace and worth And tenderness and beauty and all love, A goodlier dwelt e'en in the Paphian grove, And set him thinking if it were not this The goddess gave him in her promises. And then he woke and to himself thus spake: “Certes, great shame were on me did I break The trust that Menelaus laid on me. But he has passed over the pitiless sea To far-off isles, and may not ever come Back to the haven of his high-roofed home, And meanwhile godlike Helen pines alone: I cannot stay here always and anon, When I have sailed she will be left a prey To the rude chieftains, who will on her lay Hot impious hands and hasten to divide The kingdom as a spoil. Better my bride Were she than suffer such a cruel woe. Yes! Menelaus will not come back now, Being so long gone, and I too must be gone, Leaving the tender Queen thus doubly lone.” With such and such words to himself he glozed, While Helen on her lonely couch reposed And dreamed ('twas Aphrodite moved the queen, So sung old poets) of what might have been Had she met Priam's son in the old days, How what would now be shame might have been praise, And she been wedded to this peerless knight Bright in the hair, bright in the face, and bright In all that fills a house with joy and light, And yet no woman but an archer bold, His own well able in the field to hold With all the Spartan princes, and in speed Matched to outrun the boar, if there were need, On Mount Täygetus. And then she woke And chid herself for murmurs which she spoke Unto herself while dreaming. But it chanced That as she glid into the hall, she glanced On Paris, while he chid himself likewise. And lo it came to pass that when their eyes Met, all the chidings vanished, and straightway They thought but of the goodliness which they Looked on in one another, and their hearts Mingled, and, heedless of dread Hera's darts, Who sanctifieth marriage, and the wrath Of Menelaus, stepped on to the path, Which leads through halls and gardens of delight Down to the black abyss, and on that night And many another after, took deep draughts Of passion's magic cup, until the shafts Of Eos drove the friendly shades away. But last of all there came the hateful day, Put back how often, when he needs must sail Back to the Ilian shore, when favouring gale And low waves and propitious augury Conspired to bid the wanderer to sea, And even Paris durst no longer stay Lest Zeus himself should chafe at his delay. And so he called his Trojans, and gave word That on the morrow he would go aboard And hoise sail for the Troad. Whereat they Shouted with joy, seeing that many a day It had been their desire once more to come Unto the softer living of their home, Its rich broad meadows and its goodly trees, Its wealth and well-built houses; for of these Small store was there at Sparta, great and strong In heroes as she was. Then all day long He and fair Helen gave themselves to love, Although at first he took good heart and strove To bid her his farewell, and swiftly go Down to his ships to spread all sail and row Beyond the reach of ill. But still she clung Close unto him, and on his shoulder hung, And whispered that the summer sun was slow In making home, and that fair winds would blow For long days yet, and that the seas in June Were softer than a summer afternoon. Then wherefore haste to stand to sea that day? Or, if that day, why row the bark away Before the sun's wrath softened and the eve Stole down the sky the rowers to relieve With calm and cool? And even as she spake She heaved up sighs as though the parting brake Her heartstrings, and her white hands garlanded About his neck, pressing her golden head Against his shoulder lovingly. But he Read in his heart a sullen augury Of threatening ill, and, deeming that he might Avert their consummation by swift flight, Turned a deaf ear to her most moving pray'rs, And to assist the seamen in their cares For watering and provision, forthwith passed Down to his fleet black ship. But at the last, When all things needful were within the hold, In glitter of her beauty and red gold Came peerless Helen, with a goodly train Of virgins in bright raiment, Tyrian Sea-purple or vermilion, whom she Left standing by the ship's side on the quay, And herself stepping on an outspread cloak, Which one who seemed a ruler of ship-folk Strewed for her slim, white, daintily-sandalled feet, His homage with soft courtesy did greet, And asked for Paris, safe voyage and God-speed Wishing to bid him, and see if indeed He was for sailing, and, when he had come, Spake unto him of speeding to his home, And, bidding him farewell in accents clear, That all the folk who stood about might hear, When they set up their din of loud applause, Whispered to him to plead some specious cause And stave the sailing off but for one day, But for the night. Yet still he said her nay In that he feared to. And then she again, Seeing that Paris dared not to remain, Gathered a desperate courage from despair, And, flinging off all wifely shame and care In the fierce love that lorded o'er her heart, And, reckoning life naught should he depart And leave her lonely in the bronze-sheathed house, Whispered to him in accents tremulous And passionate that, when she gave the word, He should his faulchion draw and cut the cord Which moored the ship and put straight out to sea And carry her with him, and said that she Would so dispose her train that none should be Able to raise a finger in despite When that she gave the signal for their flight. And so it fell: for, bidding virgins twain To stay by her, she bade the rest to gain The homestead with all haste, and bring from thence A milk-white steer with gilt horns and incense For sacrifice and banquet, and rich wine To win with gifts the clemency divine Of King Poseidon, and to hold high feast In honour of their parting, ancient guest. And, when that they were gone, and as she thought Come to the house, she turned about and sought Paris, and he, although his heart waxed chill Beneath the same presentiment of ill, Bade to let go, and the huge galley leapt, Like a loosed dog, from out the pier, and swept With stately swing of deftly fitted oars And swell of purple sails, and with bright spores Of phosphorescent water sprinkled back As the swift prow sped on its gleaming track, And with rich strains of flutes and wafts of spice Breathed from the poop moulded with some device Of the Dædalian art, straight out to sea. And those two sate together lovingly Beneath an awning of thick web, with sides Curtained from view, three golden eventides And morningtides. And for the time great joy Was theirs, but tempered with a dull alloy Of aguish misgivings, and remorse, Which sits behind the rider on the horse Of pleasure when he tramples 'neath the hoofs Another's paradise. And now the roofs Upon the shore began to fade from view, And they were left between the nether blue And upper, without aught within their sight To break the ring of azure, save the flight Of wingèd fish escaping from the jaws Of the bonitos to the expectant maws Of hovering snowy sea birds, till the isles With which the glorious Ægæan smiles Fronted the flying bark, and made them heed Unto their helm and move with minished speed. And so they came to Troy one summer day, And long whiles ere they passed right up the bay, Through the shrouds looking, Helen did she list Could see the shore's grey outline, dimmed with mist As by a mist of tears or by a dream— So in her ecstasy it well might seem. But when they drew up to the quays of Troy The city folk met them with hail of joy, Seeing the well-known sails which they had deemed Would never come again, and all men streamed Down from the seaward gate unto the quay, And women too, bareheaded, fired to see The darling of their city once again, Him who had been the brightest of all men, Swiftest in chace, and surest with the bow, And who had scouted every thought of woe, Making the townsmen glad and of good heart, Ready to play a gallant manly part, On field or wall against the enemy. This was the Paris of their memory, Not like the after Paris, weak with sin, Careless of all things so that he might win Another hour with Helen, unashamed, Though worsted in the fight, and world-wide blamed As coward, miscreant, and city curse, And basest knight of all the universe. And when they looked on Helen, every shout Doubled itself and brought even elders out To see what good it should be that could raise An outburst so beyond the wont of praise. Such infinite grace was in her visage seen To gladden eyes of men, and all her mien So gentle, godlike, marvellously bright, That all their hearts clave unto her outright; Nor did she ever fall from that high state, But men were glad to meet their bitter fate For her sake till the city fell. Such love Had the gods deigned her in all hearts to move. So they went up to Ilion, and the crowd Followed with glee and joyous shoutings, proud Of their long-lost and late-recovered chief And his fair bride, and dreaming not that grief Out of such joyful auspices should come. And thus Queen Helen came to her new home. He ceased mid acclamation—all Listening to the fate and fall Of Helen with attention wrapt, And one there thinking how it happed That he had had a Helen too, A Helen who was fair to view, And loved by all who looked on her For womanly soft character, With woman's steel devotion mixed, And who her love unfaltering fixed On him, although he lived away For years as many as Greece lay Before the ramparts of Troy town, A Helen who had never known A Paris—with clear sapphire eyes Which never bent in loving wise On any eyes but his, with hair, So beautifully waved and fair, Which never felt a coaxing hand Save his, who left her native land To share his exile and new home, And not, like the first Helen, roam To leave her husband. Helen Forte, Wholly unconscious of the thought Which flitted through her husband's brain, Was thinking in a thankful strain How merciful it was that she Had ne'er been left by fate to be Tempted like her fair eponym, Not counting her long wait for him As aught. So potent is the spell Cast over women who love well. Nor were the two old folks alone Moved by the evening's tales, for one Had listened to Nausicaa's grief On learning that the island-chief Was wedded, and would sail away Not without picturing a day When she herself might sadly gaze Toward the dim horizon's haze. This story of Nausicaa Planted the embryo of dismay In her soft heart, though she cared not, So she assured herself, one jot For the Professor. Yet she knew, And swiftly the conviction grew, That did she learn that he was wed A load of disappointment dead Would press on her, that when he went The gentle hours of content Would take wing with him. Margaret, Although she understood not yet Much of the meaning of the tale Of Spartan Helen, did not fail To sympathize with her as one On whom much woe would fall anon. And practical Maud Morrison Made up her mind that she would ne'er Herself as witlessly ensnare As the Greek Queen pourtrayed therein, The type of beauty in soft sin, With no fault but her frailties, To bards of thirty centuries. The dancing flagged that night because Phil, who had waltzed with scarce a pause On yule night with Maud Morrison, Was so unsettled by the tone Kit had maintained while going to And coming back from Linlithgow, Though she was his companion Through the delicious afternoon, That he was fain to spend the night In hanging by her side to right That which was keeping them apart, Not knowing in his blinded heart That he was wooing his ill-fate By striving to ingratiate. “Leave well alone” 's a proverb old, And truly, if the truth were told, “Leave everything alone” should be A proverb too. The more that we Multiply schemes and work we do Multiply our misfortunes too. The worst misfortunes of my life I've brought down on my head by strife, To lessen or to obviate Misfortunes of a lighter weight Which I anticipated and Which would have, had I held my hand, By a mysterious Power, been Diverted from me (as I've seen By the event). And thus poor Phil Forced on his crisis. Pretty Lil And the Professor somehow found That although waltzing round and round Has its own pleasures, maid and man By sitting still together can Equal, if not more joy obtain: So they too left the mazy train, And as young ladies entertain A fear that if, e'en once they let A man not in their dancing set Dance with them much, because there are None of the real caviare At hand, they afterwards may find The barrier thus undermined Hard to shore up to its old strength, Poor Maud was satisfied at length That she would have no dance that night: So, wearing an expression bright Which did not in the least express Her frame of mind, she went to press Her services on Mrs Forte As the musician, cutting short Remonstrance with insistance stern That she must be allowed her turn Or could not bear to dance again. A threefold end did she attain By this manœuvre. Firstly, she Did honestly desire to be Considerate; and secondly, It saved her having to comply With undesirable requests For dances, which good taste's behests Would not permit her to refuse; And thirdly, 'twould be an excuse If while she stayed there, she should chance Again to deprecate a dance. And further she could play so well That, like most people who excel, It flattered her to thus display Her skill. And playing chased away The demonry of jealousy Which haunted her when Phil stood by The Queenly Kit, who, ill at ease With his mistimed attempts to please, Was scarce her royal self that night, Though she made some few sallies bright, But occupied with all her strength In keeping him at sword-arm's length. The dancing lapsed, and left therewith Maud to the clutch of Lachlan Smith, And Hall and Will in sheer despair Taking to billiards;—the whole air Was thundercharged with discontent. Meanwhile the very contrast lent Fresh graces to the laughing girl, Baring a gleaming rim of pearl At each fresh anecdote and jest Related to her with such zest By the Professor, who began To feel himself a happier man When good hap let him wile away An hour alone in converse gay With this warm-hearted gentle fay. It certainly beatifies Those who are not too worldly-wise To have bright tender maiden's eyes Sharing one's gaze at everything, And white hands always dallying Before one; and it pleases well If, when one has a tale to tell, A pretty Lil with little ear Is stretched on the “qui vive” to hear Each word one says; nor does one's mind, If not too seriously inclined, Object to a companion graced With girlhood's flower, summer-faced And sunny-haired and fairy-light, Though not below the middle height. December 27th. Last night before they went to bed A picnic they'd determinèd Into the forest, some to seek A dish of yabbers Yabbers are small fresh water cray fish rather larger than prawns. from the creek, And some to gather maiden-hair, And some to shoot and some to share In laying lunch and brewing tea. Phil drove the buggy, and much he Entreated Kit his mate to be, Which, seeing that it held but two, She steadily refused to do; And as his pride would not submit Beside her in a trap to sit With any driving but his own, He had to take Maud Morrison, Only too pleased to have the chance Of watching two swift ponies prance Before a deft whip, while she sate With her prime favourite tête-à-tête. A thorough bushman, Albert Hall, Had scarce been lured to go at all, He'd too much of the real thing To care about this picnicing. He liked to picnic on a chair At table with a dinner fair, And would have not gone had not Kit, Gauging him with a woman's wit, Offered her horse, the fiery grey, Which she on the preceding day Had mastered with such horsemanship And without martingale or whip. For well-contested stand-up fight 'Twixt man and horse was his delight, And much of it was waged in sight Of one or other, because Will Had asked him to keep up until All gates were passed. Their road at first Lay between paddocks interspersed With few trees, rung, Rung, i.e., ring-barked. and mostly dead; But when some miles were passed it led Into a forest track which oft Was block'd with “tea-tree bottom” soft Or fallen trunk, compelling them To make detours, and thrice a stem Some inches through had to be topped, Or they would have been wholly stopped. Kit eyed the “new-chum” carefully To see if he was scared thereby, But when her gaze upon him turned She found him wholly unconcerned. He had gone up in her esteem Because, although he did not seem Well used to horses, yet he shewed So much nerve when he drove or rode. Will drove, and the Oxonian Shared the box-seat with her, to scan Whate'er there was of scenery, Or unfamiliar to the eye. Kit drove upon the road and track, But, when they left it, Will took back The reins, because he knew the lie Of gaps in the vicinity. Inside were Lil and Margaret And Lachlan Smith on one side set, And on the other Chesterfield And Mrs Forte and Ida pealed Glad laughter. So they came at last To where a muddy creek ran past An open space, of brushwood clear, Where they could kindle without fear A fire to boil the “billy” on. Here Phil Forte and Maud Morrison Were camped already—Phil, in spite Of his first disappointment, bright. Maud was so pretty, and then she Snubbed many men so ruthlessly That preference from her conferred A kind of honour. She had heard His overtures by Kit declined And had forthwith made up her mind, If he asked her, to exercise Her repertoire of witcheries To make him in his own despite Enjoy himself—and won the fight. It took Hall some time to enforce Complete obedience from his horse, But then the noble beast confessed The masterhand and ceased contest. When he arrived he volunteered To go with any who preferred Shooting to fishing. Only one Went with him, Lachlan Smith—the gun Was the Professor's, which he'd brought In case some specimen he sought Flew by him. The young barrister Quite equalled any Londoner In cockneyism, though he was Australian-born, and gave Hall cause To take the gun for all their sakes, In terror at his wild mistakes, Upon the pretext (which was true) That the great common cockatoo, Which Lachlan wanted most to shoot, Was a most shy and wary brute, Till one was wounded and its cries Brought others round to sympathise. “Give me the gun,” he said, “and I Will sneak along until I spy One within easy shot. My eye Will note them much more easily Than yours.” And then he plunged into The scrub and soon was lost to view. He had not fired a single shot When he returned, though in one spot A huge black snake he'd seen as near As horn to horn upon a deer. He'd passed it lest the gun's report Should scare the birds and spoil his sport. So wholly was he without dread Of what, had he not been bush bred, Might have appeared like courting death. 'Twas fortunate that he not Smith Came on it. What that legal sun In his excitement might have done Made the stout bushman shudder more Than coming on black snakes, a score. The ferners too had seen a snake, A small one, which contrived to make Escape into its hole unhurt. Chesterfield's nails were full of dirt But he and blue-eyed Margaret And Mrs Forte had not as yet Much else results for toil to show, Though Albert, when they told him so, Plunged back into the scrub and brought An armful of the prize A curious and rather rare variety of “Maiden-hair.” they sought, With roots attached and fronds as large As oak-ferns grow beside the marge Of dripping rocks and welling rills, Beneath the blue Dumfriesshire hills. Ida was cook and parlour-maid, And with Will's help the lunch-cloth laid, But not the luncheon: for the ants Were eager as annuitants, As, not to be particular, Ants in Australia always are. In fact, the ant has far more right To have its portrait opposite The picture of the kangaroo Upon our Arms than the Emu, In that the latter every year Less and less commonly appear, A statement which does not apply To the ant's busy family. Will lit the fire, and Ida boiled The tea and the potatoes spoiled, Which in the ashes were to be Toast-roasted so deliciously. In the meantime the other five Were catching stores of “fish-alive,” That is to say that two were, Lil And the Professor. Kit and Phil And Maud were far too worryish To do much good at catching fish, Proving the proverb's truth and fun That “two are company, three none.” For Phil Forte wished Maud Morrison, Who, as his drive's companion Had wooed him so engagingly, Right at the bottom of the sea, Or anywhere but where she was, And Maud at all events had cause To wish Kit anywhere but there, While Kit would rather that the pair Would take themselves post haste elsewhere And let her fish escape at will In trying to escape from Phil. But meanwhile, higher up the stream Lil and her partner, in a dream Of happiness, could scarcely pull Their lines up fast enough, so full Of yabbers seemed the creek where they Had pitched their quarters for the day. Their plan was simple and complete, To tie a piece of lean raw meat To a long stick, and leave between A yard of string, and when they'd seen Their quarry strike to raise the bait, And a land-net insinuate Behind the yabber, which darts back Whenever it suspects attack. Lil taught the piscatorial art, And the Professor lent his heart As well as his intelligence To mastering its rudiments. He tried the baits, she used the net With practised skilfulness, and met With most unqualified success Till luncheon came compassionless. The lunch was hardly packed away When picnic-making for the day Was stopped most unexpectedly With heavy rain. The morn was dry, And not a sign of rain had there Appeared on the barometer, And when they reached the house again They found that not a drop of rain Had fallen on the open plain, Thus showing how undoubtedly Forests attract humidity. Maud Morrison, in angry fit At Phil's neglect of her for Kit, Said she preferred the waggonette, And so it fell to Margaret To soothe his temper through a drive Of miles not less than twenty-five, Soaked to the skin before the start, And with a big lump in her heart Of pity for her brother's woe, Which every one divined although No one had put the thought in words. If gaudy feathers make fine birds There were no fine birds present there Excepting Lil, and her welfare Was due to the Professor's cloak, Which he, accustomed to the soak So imminent on any day In Cumberland or Galloway, Had, mid much laughter, stowed away Before he left, beneath a seat. Now he reaped thirty-fold, so sweet Looked a fair face amid the tweed, And gratitude for his kind deed. Her mother too escaped the whole Beneath a cotton parasol, The food for many a biting jest When she for its inclusion pressed (To save her from the sun, not rain). The sunshine soon revived again Kit's dress of ‘homespun’ cheviot: But all that sun could shine could not Restore the cherry and pale blue Washed from their sashes broad into Ida's and Maud's white dainty skirts, Or heal irreparable hurts In outraged ostrich-feathered hats, With plumes reduced from rounds to flats. They meant to start at half-past four, But started back two hours or more Before the time, because the rain Fell too hard for them to remain. And thus the clock shewed scarcely five When they passed up the carriage drive. So tennis was proposed, and Will, Giving him credit for more skill Than he, at any rate, possessed When out of form, politely pressed The Oxford man to form a set With him, his brother Phil and Kit, Assigning him, as most expert, To Kit, whose pride was nowise hurt By the insinuation thus Launched at her tennis genius By Will unwittingly. But they Proved quite unequal to the fray, As all thought likely. Phil could play A ‘finished’ game, with ‘low return,’ And ‘service’ regular and stern, Dealt ‘overhand’ and much neat ‘out,’ While Will excelled in ‘reach’ and ‘put,’ And had he practised with his peers Need certainly have had no fears From Phil, though Phil was champion That year in Melbourne. But Phil won Set after set whene'er they played Against each other, for he made Fewer mistakes, and seldom gave A ‘loose-ball’ quarter. Kit was brave, But soon perceived the hopelessness Of winning even scant success, Though the Professor now and then Fairly out-paced her countrymen With a half volley quick and low, Which few lawn-tennisers can do Who were not racquet-bred in youth, And he could give more ‘cut’ in truth Than Phil himself, but then he ‘served’ So many faults that he observed That if ‘cut’ only won the day He might be somewhere in the play, But while returning ‘overnet’ And into ‘court’ won ev'ry set, He would have hardly any chance With Phil's cool, well-timed elegance. Kit, for a lady, played with skill Hardly inferior to Phil, ‘Served’ well and ‘took her balls backhand And front’ with wonderful command, And ‘cut’ well: her great weakness lay In her not ‘getting back’ to play A fast ball ‘volleyed’ straight at her. After the first set it was clear That she must play with Phil to make An even match, which for all's sake Was better. The Oxonian Was much ashamed to be the man To spoil a lady's game, and Phil Had sulked at being given Will Instead of Kit. The other court Had Lachlan Smith and Lily Forte On one side, and Maud Morrison And Chesterfield in union Upon the other. Neither he Nor Smith played very skilfully, And he was much the worst. Howe'er His partner did not seem to care, Although she hated as a rule One who was clumsy or a fool. In truth most girls it gratifies To have the chance to patronise A man so marked in any walk, As to attract the great world's talk. She herself played lawn tennis well, Though she did not like Kit excel. And though Lil, when she played her best, Played better, but then Maud possessed So much more self-reliant ‘pluck’ That in a match, without good luck, Lil would succumb submissively. Maud took her cue with rapid eye, And, seeing that they could not win, Determined lightly to give in In play, and her whole strength to wield In fascinating Chesterfield. When they had done one set they went To watch the other tournament, Which in the time was almost through The last game of set number two. Will, who had noticed Lachlan Smith Looking at the Professor with A glance of scorn and pity mixed At his mis-strokes, was so much vexed That he invited him to be His partner in set number three, At the same time inviting Kit And Phil, who entered into it Most thoroughly, with telling glance To make him rue the circumstance, Which they did, playing every ball Hard back to him, till his downfall Was rendered final and complete By Will's suggesting that the net Might suit him better, where the two Bade fair to beat him black and blue With well-directed volleyings. Nor was the altered state of things Unpleasing to the other set Where Lil and the Professor met In fascinating rivalry, Each wishing to be outdone by The rival. Lil looked prettier For the excitement and the stir As she did ever, when there came Into her cheeks the rosy flame, The charm she most lacked: and the game Served to display the native grace Of all her motions, while her face Was wreathed in smiles which now gave place To merry laughter, now were still Because a stroke taxed all her skill. When from the dinner they withdrew The audience was less by two, For Phil and Hall had sauntered out To smoke and chat and stroll about, Liking their own society Better than sitting idly by, While the Professor on demand Told what they scarce could understand, And did not care for in the least. And even Will was ill at rest, Although he thought it impolite Not to be present. On that night Ida was chosen queen, but said, That as a queen already had Thrice worn the crown, 'twas time for it Upon three gentlemen to sit, And acclamation hailed the thought And chose the host first, who besought The story-teller for a tale Romantic and historical. THE LAST OF THE BRITONS, OR THE LEGEND OF DUNMAIL RAISE. Round Grisedale's mountain-girdled mere The latest moon of all the year Lights in its wane an ancient host, Each warrior an armour'd ghost, Arm'd with the arms our country bore E'er its first foeman touch'd its shore: Of bronze their sword, of flint their spear, Their leathern shield a hide of deer, A British host, the last that held The land, that all was theirs of eld. Ten hundred years scarce pass'd away After that first great Easter-day E'er not a Keltic lord was known Through all the coasts of Albion, Save in the stormy hills of Wales, And Cornwall's mines, and Cumbria's dales, And Mona's citadel; And Saxon was in league with Scot From this his last and best lov'd lot The Briton to expel. Then all at once the loyal men Of Cymri leapt from rock and glen To join their king Dunmail; From saddle-back'd Blencathra's height, Where, hidden from the sun's good light, The tarn they call Bowscale Reflects the stars at middle day, While in its depths unfathom'd play That strange immortal twain, The only fish in this wide earth That liv'd at our Redeemer's birth: They know not death or pain, But live until he comes again, For they, they only, did remain Of that world famous seven Wherewith the ‘Lord of Life’ did feed Those thousands four—this precious meed To them alone is given. At once did Cumbria's noblest pour From all the peaks of huge Skiddaw, From Skiddaw's cub, since called Latrigg, From Windermere and Newby Brig. High in the west from grim Sca'fell, And wild Wastwater's lonely dell, The dalesmen hurried down to bring Arms, few but faithful to their king. High in the east along that road, The highest ever built, they strode: And not a few from Langdale Pikes, And Furness Fells and Furness Dykes, Which now the sea doth hold, But flocks and beeves and giant trees, And corn that shimmered in the breeze, Held in the days of old. Ten thousand—good men all, and true— Came where his royal standard flew, To fight for hearth and home; A home they'd held a thousand years 'Gainst Dane and Saxon, and the spears E'en of Imperial Rome. Hard by Helvellyn's mountain-steep, Where Leathes' mere begins to peep, Rises a knoll, in later days Call'd in the dale King Dunmail's Raise. Here 'neath the mountain's shoulders sheer The road that runs from Windermere Is one long hill from Grasmere shore To Wy'burn town, six miles or more. In such a pass three hundred men Might drive ten thousand back again: Upon this rise did Dunmail post His faithful, but too scanty, host. But what avails devotion high, Or chivalrous fidelity, When tenfold is the foeman's rank, And pouring in on front and flank. 'Twas thus that royal Dunmail's might Was shattered in that fatal fight; For while ten times ten-thousand men, The Saxon host, charged up the glen, Down huge Helvellyn's rugged side Pour'd the fierce Scot as pours the tide Of some long-prisoned mountain stream When broken is th' opposing beam That damm'd its flood and turn'd its flow To drive the miller's wheel below; Or like the Cyclon blasts that sweep Over the face of India's deep. The Briton bravely met the charge With levell'd spear and sturdy targe: But vain—for, hemm'd on every hand, Nought could avail the gallant band: Not all the valour and the might Of Arthur and each boasted knight Nam'd of the Table Round; Not all King Charlemagne's array Of Paladins that on a day A grave with Roland found. A fiercer charge—his host gives way, And Scot and Saxon fierce to slay Cut down the Britons man by man, Till scarce a tithe of all the clan Fight their way through to tell the tale And save the crown of King Dunmail. For he has lost his faithful brand, And now is in the foeman's hand, With both his sons, ill-fated three, Doom'd to a conqueror's cruelty, Their only crime that they did fight To keep the realm that was their right. Bound hand and foot with cords they lay Until the ending of the fray Should give their conqueror liberty To revel in his cruel glee. Then—such the custom of his day— With his own hand does Edmond slay The sire before the children's eyes And blinds them soon as e'er he dies. The Britons who escap'd the fray Hid on the hills till close of day, Then dug a grave twelve fathoms deep And laid their monarch down to sleep, And rais'd a cairn of boulders high In homage to his memory: Then wended in procession drear To hide his crown in Grisedale mere. With weapons fiercely clench'd they strode Three miles along the Grasmere road, Until they came to Grisedale burn, And up the Faery glen did turn: Awhile upon Seat-Sandal pause, Then slowly wind through Grisedale Hause Down to the mere and through the crown Where Dollywaggon Pike sheers down. Fierce was the wave and fierce the storm, And mist-besieg'd the mountain's form; The Spirits of the Lake and hills Were anger'd at their country's ills, Anger'd that stranger-hands had ta'en The Briton's last, best loved domain. That night o'er forest, lake, and fell Resounded many a ghostly yell; Around Helvellyn's giant man With threat'ning glare the marsh-fire ran. In becks, that yester summer's night Scarce trickled down in shallows bright, By deep and furious floods were borne Great rifted rocks and trees uptorn: The wind that scarce was heard at noon Roared like an Indian typhoon, And westward over Langdale Pikes The breakers fell on Furness Dykes, And with one wild tremendous sweep Encompass'd in their greedy deep Tree, corn and cot, and grassy down From Lancaster to Barrow town. And by the forked fire from heaven The oldest Druid oak was riven. The oak-tree gods might reign no more Upon their native Britain's shore, But now must fly, to stay awhile In mother Mona's magic isle, And thence be driven in wild unrest For ever further, further west. Till, when five hundred years were gone, The land that tombs the setting sun Should feel the conquering foot of Spain; Then, ousted from their home again With other byegone godheads lie In Limbo to eternity. The Britons ere the day was light Scal'd the o'erhanging mountain-height, And climbing, just as dawn began, Held council on Helvellyn Man. Full little did they deem that night That ev'ry eve, ere dawn was bright, Their souls must go to Dunmail's cairn And through the glen to Grisedale tarn; Then over Dollywaggon seek The high Helvellyn's highest peak. Yet so it is—for there are souls Whom some almighty hand controls To haunt some too-eventful scene, Where in their lifetime they have been; Nor ever rest within their tomb Until they have fulfill'd their doom: The souls of all who've follow'd Cain, The souls of all by murder slain, Until the murderer pay the due For him that fell and him that slew; The soul of him whose life was ill, Who perish'd unrepentant still, And him who treasure has conceal'd, Until his treasure be reveal'd. And so it is that Dunmail's host Still haunt the battle-field in ghost. Did they but deign betray their trust Their souls might rest in hallow'd dust, But while they guard their monarch's crown May never to their tomb go down. And so each day from fall of night Until the morrow-morn is bright, Through Grisedale-pass that ghostly clan March grimly to Helvellyn Man. And ev'ry night from Grisedale tarn They bring a stone to Dunmail's cairn, To show their sovereign that still They're faithful to his royal will: And when the cairn doth reach as high As Dunmail 'neath the earth doth lie, Once more shall be his flag unfurl'd For the great Battle of the World, For that great battle that must be Before the day of Equity When ev'ry man shall have his own Each proud usurper overthrown, When Israel shall reign once more Upon the promised country's shore, And Cossack, Georgian, and Pole Be freed from Muscovite control. Then Dunmail with his British spears Again shall sally from the meres, And free his own, his native land From Saxon, Dane, and Norman hand. From southmost Cornwall to Carlisle, From Mona to the Kentish Isle The Cymri, as in days of yore, Shall rule our land from shore to shore; And all the Cymri clans bow down Before the might of Dunmail's crown; The crown that erst in Grisedale's deep His trusty host did nightly keep, Now, after many a hundred years, Again upon his head appears. But never shall appear again The gods that ruled our island then; Their day is past, their oaks are fell'd In which their ritual was held. No other gods shall be adored Through all the earth but Judah's Lord, And they be in that lifeless spot For ever and for aye forgot. But though that British army range Each midnight on that journey strange, No eye can see their forms, no ear Their footfall or their voices hear, Save on one night—upon that night When dies away the waning light Of the last moon of all the year: Then if thou stand by Grisedale mere, Betwixt the midnight hour and dawn, When spirits move and graveyards yawn, Through Grisedale Hause to Grisedale tide Thou'lt see a ghostly army glide In Keltic harness—such a host Fought the first Roman on our coast. See thou provoke them not to strife, 'Twere likeliest to cost thy life. But should'st thou venture to accost By Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, And bid them show thee where the crown In Grisedale mere lies low a-down, They needs must show thee; and if then Thou take the crown, they ne'er again Shall leave their grave for Grisedale tarn, Nor Dunmail ever leave his cairn; But other king shall free the land From Saxon, Dane, and Norman hand. So, if thou see that spirit host, In pity do not thou accost, Nor to indulge an idle whim Or caitiff greed do harm to him; But gaze with awe and tell the tale Of that weird army of Dunmail. Kit said, “Professor you can tell A good ghost story very well: But is it true?” He shook his head. “I would not vouch it. Dunmail's dead, If e'er he lived, and no one sights His host on any other nights. I can't say more: the legend's old, And on the Cumbrian mountains told Close by the cairn. Your course is clear, If you want more, to take ship there, And on the trysting night camp out On Mount Helvellyn. It's about As cold a place and cold a time As any in the English clime.” Kit laughed back that she'd “take his word, And treat as gospel all she heard,” And fearing Phil, and sparing Lil Her dear Professor, challenged Will To billiards, while the scouted one Fell back upon Maud Morrison, To dance his disappointment off, Impatient as a Romanoff At being crossed, no better pleased Because his friends had often teased Will as a lover undeclared. Far better the Professor fared, He had plain sailing, no one shared His fancy. All were blinded by The brighter light that was so nigh. These nights were golden nights for Lil, She thought she ne'er could have her fill Of the bright stream of wit and lore Which from his honied lips did pour. He seemed to have lived everywhere, And to know all things great and fair. Then he was manly, and he seemed Like one who, while he did much, dreamed Of higher spheres for him in store. Lil oft had been in love before, But not for men with hopes sublime Of leaving their impress on time. And he, what did he think of her? A ray of light, a soft zephyr, A fair wild flower not too bright Or large for love, an exquisite And simple air reminding him Of ballads sung in twilight dim By Tweedside, the Breton Ysolde, Or Enid of the legend old. December 28th. Eight o'clock saw them all arrive In harness for a rabbit drive, At the front door, then breakfast o'er And luncheon packed and to the fore, Kit with her feet in cowhide laced, And with her Norfolk jacket's waist Encircled with a cartridge belt, And with a slouched man's hat of felt Pressed down upon her golden hair, As though quite ignorant how fair, Was the face hidden underneath. Hall had besought that Lachlan Smith Should somehow be refused a gun, If only in apparent fun, After his feats of yesterday. And Will descried an easy way By screwing both the nipples out From his gunlock to save all doubt, Which Smith did not discover till He fired both barrels and heard—nil. Of course all present sympathised, And search-parties were organised To find the nipples (safe and sound In Will's watch-pocket, so not found). Will to crown everything explained, That now no other gun remained, So that, unless they were found out, Lachlan perforce must go without. This left seven guns, for Chesterfield Liked in a modest way to wield His central fire, and Kit could kill Almost as certainly as Will, And Mr Forte came out to-day. The shooting, some ten miles away, On broken ‘stony rises’ lay, And as the rabbits were so thick That one could kill them with a stick Not seldom, stores of cartridges Were half the battle, and horses Were wanted for the men to ride As ‘stops’ to head the rabbit-tide Which poured before the guns in flood. So no one of the party rode. But Will and Albert Hall and Kit, Left over from the waggonette And buggy, took their quarters up In a spring-waggon full to top With ammunition, guns, and lunch, And fodder for the nags to munch. Kit drove because her favourite grey Was needed for the shafts to-day, Will by her ready to assist In case its mettle tried her wrist, And Hall in futile search for ease Among the guns and cartridges. Phil drove the buggy, Margaret Being his partner, Maud not yet Having forgiven the neglect He'd offered to her self-respect, And Mr Forte the waggonette, With Lil and the Professor set Upon the box-seat, Lil was tasked To do just what she would have asked, If she had ventured to, to ride Her father and his guest beside. Arrived, the ladies took their seat Beneath some rocks to 'scape the heat, First looking round to see that they Had no snake-neighbour in the way, While Kit and all the gentlemen Were starting off on their campaign With horsemen on their left and right And horsemen in the front to fright The rabbits back, who broke away. Kit fired the first shot of the day, A true one—followed in a breath By all except poor Lachlan Smith Who first discovered his ill-luck When on void blocks his hammers struck. There is not much variety In shooting rabbits where they lie As thick as negroes in the hold Of a slave-schooner used of old. The chief of the excitement lay In watching columns break away In desperation, closely packed, Between the horsemen though they cracked Their stock-whips loud as musket-shots, And covered all the likely spots, Or when a serpent's angry hiss Caused some one in a start to miss Only to turn upon his foe And end him with a shot or blow. Serpents were too abundant far, As on the ‘Rises’ oft they are, Mostly not large but venomous. One of them was so curious (Quite six feet long and rather thin, With bright canary-coloured skin), That Mr Forte when it was dead, Fixing it just behind the head, In cleft-stick, gave it to a man To carry back to the spring-van, Meaning to send it up to town To the museum. ‘Black’ and ‘Brown’ ‘Tiger’ and ‘whip’ and ‘copperhead’ ‘Carpet’ and ‘Diamond,’ the dread ‘Death-Adder's’ self he'd chanced to spy In some part of the colony At one time or another—none Of the same colour as this one. A battue in an English wood Of pheasants trained to take their food From Keeper's hands has less excuse Than rabbit-drives, which have their use. For rabbits are as dire a foe As the wolves stamped out long ago, And battues are as merciful As arsenic or traps which pull Their limbs off but don't kill outright. A rabbit drive presents a sight Which those who in the dear old land Shoot only, scarce can understand. When once the line begins to drive The ground seems verily alive And one incessant roar of guns Tells how the tale of slaughter runs. Now your gunbarrel follows fast A rabbit as in frantic haste Along the jutting rocks he flies Which bound and break the distant rise, And now you hunch your back to bring Your fire upon them as they spring Right at your feet, now wheel sharp round On one which short reprieve had found By lying close till you had passed Now right, now left, until at last Your cartridges away you've shot Or find your barrels grown too hot To hold with comfort. You let lie Your rabbits just where they may die. No one would for a minute stop To pick the mangled vermin up But leave them for the hawks and ‘cats’ And ants that haunt their habitats,— So vast a difference it makes When the supply demand o'ertakes. Luncheon suggested, none demurred But hailed it as a welcome word. The sun was hot, the ground was rough The tussocks plentiful and tough, And they had had three hours or more Of walking without rest. Will bore The palm for shooting. Chesterfield Least deftly did his weapon wield. Kit was astonished much to see How steadily and sturdily Cobham strode on (But Will told her That as a rule the English were Great walkers—better walkers far Than average Australians are), And what fine shots he sometimes made Though he missed often. She displayed Some skill herself and Mr Forte Still shot well and enjoyed the sport. At lunch the shooters quenched their thirst With various liquors. Beer was first In favour, claret next. But Will And Mr Forte prepared to fill With oatmeal-water, which they said Was the best drink for health and head When one was hot. While Phil endured Water with only whiskey cured. Lunch over, the Professor went To chat with Lil, with whom he spent The smoking hour, soon joined by Kit, Who feared an amatory fit From Phil and sought to give redress For her enforced obtrusiveness By telling Lil how good a shot And how enduring and what not Her friend had proved, while Phil blew forth In gusty puffs of smoke his wrath. That night two fresh deserters joined The two who had at first declined, The lawyer and Maud Morrison, Maud, maybe, if the truth were known, For Phil, and Lachlan Smith for her. Success was with the barrister. For Phil and Hall had sauntered out To-night again to smoke about. Ida's suggestion, that three men, Before the ladies chose again Should choose a subject, pleasing most Will was selected for the post, Who for the evening's story chose Life in an English manor-house. When he some minutes had delayed To ponder, the Professor said The tale is one I heard at home From Fred Rowe, my old college chum. So he shall tell you, word for word Where I remember, what I heard. ETHEL. Katie is a pretty shrew; Isabel a little blue; Maud as proud as Lucifer; Christobel a sonneteer; Edith is reserv'd and fair; Eleanor hath auburn hair; Margaret is masculine; I don't care for Adeline; Beatrix is very sweet; And hath many at her feet; Nothing hath she ever harm'd, But an iceberg's sooner warmed; She's so dully temperate That she cannot even hate; All her useful life is spent In the tedious content That in story-books befalls Angels and good animals. Mary is a peacemaker, All the people round love her, And I love her passively, But she is too good for me. Daring Ethel is a queen, Most majestic in her mien And most royal in her ways; All the men her beauty praise, Not before her royal face If they dread condign disgrace. Admiration in your eyes Is her look'd-for, lawful prize; Admiration in your speech Is a statutable breach Of Her Grace's social code. No one ever waltz'd or rode, Shot an arrow or a glance, With more finish'd elegance; Neither is she over-bold, Callous, feelingless, nor cold. If she sees a rough young squire Reeling backwards from the fire Of a merciless coquette For his uncouth etiquette, She will cross a crowded room To alleviate his doom, Make him come and sit by her, Be a smiling listener To the ‘bag’ of yesterday, Where the warmest corners lay In the Earl of Foxshire's woods: How his blood-mare swam the floods, Of the row with Farmer Scroggs, And the names of all the dogs. And if talk-about is true Ethel can be tender too. Who remembers Dick Duval, Once the favourite of all? Honest, hearty, handsome Dick, Brave, and generous, and quick, But there was no runagate Ever so unfortunate. Dicky never could escape, As a schoolboy, from a scrape; Dick was never in a brawl But he came off worst of all; He, whose share was often least, Bore the blame of all the rest. Dick at last—it ne'er appear'd Why or wherefore—was cashier'd, Driven from his father's hall, Scowl'd upon and shunn'd by all. Dick to queenly Ethel came: Ethel had no word of blame, Did not turn away or frown, Ask'd no explanation, Wrung his slack hand heartily, And, looking at him earnestly, In a sweet firm whisper said: “I can trust you, Dick; you did Nothing base, or mean, or low; What you did I do not know. Do not tell me—only say That you would not turn away From a man who did the same As from one whose touch was shame.” While a tear splash'd in the dust, “Bless you, Ethel, for your trust,” Was the broken-voic'd reply; “Never such a thing did I. But I came to say good-bye: I am going to the East, Under Osman to enlist, From my name to wipe the stain, And retrieve fair fame again.” “Dick, I will not bid you stay, Go and wipe the stain away; One thing promise me, that you Nothing in despair will do; Try to come safe home again, You have one who will remain E'er your firm and faithful friend; Promise, Dick, and try to mend, No more getting into scrapes, No more hazardous escapes, Saving when you face the foe, But then do as brave men do; Wait until the battle—then Give your gallant heart the rein; And, if you have time to write, Send the story of a fight Bravely fought and bravely won, How you are, and what you've done; Saying when, your penance o'er, You are coming home once more, And where letters will reach you.” “Who will write them, if I do?” “I myself, Dick.” “You will?” “Yes, I do not desert distress.” “And can you, who are so fair, Coveted by all men, care— Stoop to correspond with me?” “Correspond? Yes, certainly. Dick I place you far before All the faultless fools who bore One to death with etiquette; Who have nothing to regret, Not because no ill they've wrought, But because they've not done aught Saving sleep, and drink, and eat, And I hold the manly heat That lands you in scrape and stain Far above the force of brain That leads some men to apply Lifetimes to philosophy, In contempt of common things— Births, and loves, and buryings. You've been hearty to excess, But I like you none the less.” “Hear me, Ethel, I am mad, But I am not wholly bad; I am mad, but going away For long months, perhaps for aye; Hear me, Ethel, long have I Loved you most devotedly, In the days when I was heir To the acres broad and fair Which are mine no longer now, In the bright days of my youth And wild days of later growth. But you ever seem'd too good, Of too queenly womanhood, And too wonderful to be For a simple man like me. Hear me, Ethel, ere I go,— Hear me,—I would have you know That I love you as none can But a passion-ridden man. Hear me; if I live to come, With refurbish'd honour, home, And you e'er should need my aid, If in life-blood it were paid, I would shed it every drop To give you a minute's hope. But if I should never come, Try to clear my name at home. I will write you all the tale Of this last scrape while I sail. Good-bye, Ethel: do you weep? Tears for worthier sorrows keep; I'm not worth a single tear From your lashes. Ethel dear, Darling Ethel, do not cry.” “Wait, Dick, do not say good-bye, I love you too: if you still Wish to marry me, I will Wish to marry you, love.” “No, Not when I have sunk so low; You who seemed too good for me In my old prosperity. Darling, you would stoop too far, Fair and noble as you are. I am, do I what I can, A dishonourable man.” “Not dishonourable, Dick: Ills have fallen fast and thick On your wild, unlucky head, But I know you truly said You've not done since you were born What would make you shrink in scorn From a man who'd done the same, As from one whose touch was shame. Dick, you shall not leave me thus.” “You are over-generous.” “If I may not be your wife I'll be single all my life; But I will not bid you stay Till the stain is wip'd away By good service bravely done On the field of action; But when you come home again I'll be yours if you are fain.” Dick look'd at her wistfully. “Ethel, is this charity— Just your nobleness of heart, Seeing all my friends depart But yourself—or is it true?” “True: I always have loved you; But if you had come to me In your wild prosperity Then I should have answer'd, No, Not until you've learn'd to show What good stuff you're moulded of. When you've proven this, enough, I will gladly be your wife. But while all you do is rife With outrage and escapade, I would sooner be a maid. Now, you do not need advice, But the light of loving eyes.” “Sweet, this generosity Too heroic is for me; I can't be so generous As to once again refuse Such a crown of love as this. Darling Ethel, let me kiss Your kind hand before I go.” “Let you kiss my hand, Dick! No: Kiss my lips; they're not too good For a brave man: spare your blood And spare life whene'er you may, Strike home on a doubtful day; If you can write to me, try; Good-bye, dear old Dick, good-bye!” This is Ethel's mystery, No one knows it all but me. Ethel bearded Squire Duval In his study at the hall, Told him Dick was not to blame, But his answer was the same. “Dick's disgraced an ancient line, He's no longer son of mine.” But there's nought he will not do, If Queen Ethel asks him to, Saving this; and on a day, After Ethel's gone away, He will say, with almost joy, “She did not desert my boy.” When you look upon her face, In her beauty you can trace Something wistful now and then; Then she turns and smiles again On her waiting worshippers: They know not this spur of hers Press'd against her noble heart, And, when bootless they depart, Mutter slanders of coquette. I myself should not know yet Were it not that Dick and I Were school-cronies formerly, Shared a study and a crib, Had a fight: I broke his rib, He made music in my head. When he went away, he said: “Ethel, I've told all to Fred; He and I are limb and limb, Make a confidant of him When you want to talk of me.” This is how I came to be Privy to her sacrifice. Often, with her grave sweet eyes, Fasten'd on me, she will ask Me of every trick and task Of his scapegoat schoolboy life. He is worthy such a wife; Try your best, you will not find Better fellow of his kind. He'd have been a famous knight In the bright enchanted night Of Provencal chivalry. Modern-times reality, Like a dull unwelcome day, Drove the magic night away With its legendary grace. When I look upon her face, Making Dick a schoolboy Cid, Rubbing up the feats he did, And her grateful fluent eyes Give me eloquent replies, Oft I wish that I might plead Someone else's cause instead. But I have a pet as well, Lovely, laughing, light-heart Nell. We don't talk of love, but play At it all and every day: I steal kisses and she laughs, Swear they're earnest, and she chaffs. Once, when I contrived to go Underneath the misletoe, Saying she'd a score to pay, She kiss'd me and tripp'd away, Not too quickly to be caught, And with well-feign'd struggles brought Underneath the bough once more. We've had quarrels o'er and o'er, But we always make it up, Neither cares to sulk or mope. If my sisters hint that I Feel for Nellie tenderly, I'm indignant, and retort, From a well-assur'd report, Of Sir This, and Captain That, Giving tits for every tat. If her cousin, Bertie Bell, Whispers spitefully to Nell, “Nellie, you're in love with Fred,” She will toss her pretty head, And, with mock humility, Drop a curtsey and reply, “Well, and if your charge were true, Better far with Fred than you.” All the same one's fidgety When the other is not by. We engage at ev'ry ball For the waltzes one and all: Waltzing's too divine a dance To be left to common chance: You should only waltz with one In such perfect unison With you, as you cannot get Save you often practise it: Squares we always give away. When it's supper time, we stay Till the extras all are done, Then we go and sup alone, Make the mottoes vehicles For the truths one never tells Without such occasion. Whispering we linger on Until we away are sent Or slip into sentiment: Then we go and waltz again Feeling fire in ev'ry vein: Nellie shuts a blithe blue eye In delicious ecstasy, As we float (we hate to haste), And I clasp her slender waist With a more expressive arm: Sweet abandon is her charm: Nellie looks her loveliest When the sunny elf-locks, press'd In the heavy plaits behind, Play the truant in the wind, And the errand-blushes stay And don't hurry straight away Soon as they have said their say. Ev'ry Christmas here we meet At my father's country seat, Staying for a month or more: Ev'ry Christmas, when it's o'er, Many wish it would begin And think breaking-up a sin. Nell and I are worst of all, We'd like Christmas day to fall Once a month: and now I find That I must make up my mind; For we clearly can't go on In the way we've always done; Nellie will be eighteen soon, I was twenty-one in June. 'Twas windy, and so when he ceased All hasted in, Kit first, ill-pleased At the unconquered Ethel's fall Which seemed almost prophetical. I would have said all went but Lil, Who braved discomfort and the chill, To steal a tête-à-tête, and said, “Is Ethel Kit?” He shook his head. “For many reasons, no. Firstly, 'Twould be gross personality; And secondly, while Ethel loved Her beauty's due, Miss Johnstone's moved By no such female weaknesses; And thirdly, she affects the dress Of gentlemen and manly sports, While Ethel's foibles and fortes Were feminine. No Amazon Professed was she, but merely one Of those proud high-bred English dames Of families with ancient names And great estates, who scorn to stoop In marriage, but whose eyes look up To some high union which time Has in his hand for them, sublime In their ambitions. They are right; Why should a girl, at first invite, Haste to throw heart and hand away, The one trump-card she has to play?” “But who was Nellie? Are all girls Who don't aspire to dukes and earls And premiers and millionaires So easy in their love affairs As Nell!” asked Lil, who thought, if so, That her wings were a little slow, And England certainly must be A country of the brave and free, And recollecting how she had, While they were still a child and lad, Enjoyed a romp of kiss and pet With Ted, Kit's brother, fancied yet That if such romps were etiquette They might sometimes be very nice. He answered with this sage advice For one in the near neighbourhood Of a fair girl with southern blood And rosy lips and yielding mien, That “Nells could not be often seen Even in England, where Mammas And Mrs Grundy and papas Shut off the naughty and the nice From girls with barriers of ice, That romps at home as well as school Were the exception not the rule, But there were boys who would be boys And girls who looked for other joys Than church and fancy work and tea, That Nells there were and needs must be In every age, in every clime, As long as there is space or time, Nells who rejoice to cull the flower Which grows on every passing hour.” And then he pulled her on his knee And kissed her, asking her if she Had not been treated thus before, And, she not struggling, gave her more And added in a whisper “Lil, Will you?” when she replied “I will” And put her little hands in his And held her lips up for a kiss. Now mark the wit of womankind, And learn that love is not so blind As poets picture him to be, For when Lil sought her bedroom she, While still the gentlemen sat to Their glass of water—and Lochdhu, Called in her mother and confessed, Entreating her to do her best To win her father to her choice, Pleading with that sweet gentle voice Which won all hearers to her part. Now Helen had a tender heart, And her ten yearning years of troth Tended to make her very loath Her children's longings to postpone A single month: and Lil was one To give her much anxiety. She was so pretty and so free From guile as well as self-restraint, And he would have to be a saint Who scorned her gentle glowing charms And shrank from her extended arms. She had been wooed three times before, And each time thrown the wooer o'er With much reluctance—souls of make Like hers love Love for its own sake. Her other lovers had been men As much drawn by the hope of gain In marrying the squatter's child As by the face which on them smiled; But the Professor had a clear Six or eight hundred pounds a year Of salary, e'en suppose he had No penny of his own to add, A sum with which as bachelor He certainly could do much more, Than married with as much again. That he was capable was plain From his appointment: and his mind Seemed honourable, broad, and kind: He was nice-looking in the face, And gentlemanly in his ways, And ‘Chesterfield’ had said that he Came of a good old family. Then Lily seemed so fond of him, And, if it was no passing whim But an absorbing love . . . . . . . (and she Owned to a sensibility Herself of the Professor's charm). Nor was Lil kept in long alarm, For, when her father came to bed, The mother for the daughter pled So winningly that his consent Was granted her incontinent, Subject to conversation due Upon the morrow with the two. Kind Helen, far too kind to keep A darling daughter from her sleep With doubt and trembling on a theme So near her heart as this would seem, Stole to her bedroom on tip-toe, Her prayer's success to let her know. But reader, be it not supposed That Lil and her Professor closed Their interesting interview So very briefly as I do. Whatever at the time had been Her satisfaction at fourteen When Ted had petted her, she now Felt to herself inclined to vow That it was not a patch upon That which she just had undergone, And was prepared to undergo Till further notice—in the glow Of mutual love oblivious quite Of the chill roughness of the night, Which maybe, since it kept the rest Within the house, was for the best. Here Lil disclosed confidingly (Still nestling on her lover's knee, While her soft damask cheeks and lips Frequently underwent eclipse), What palpitations of dismay The story of Nausicaa Had wakened, how she'd nursed a dread That he would turn out to be wed, Though it did not at first occur What difference it made to her; How she had shuddered at the day When he would have to go away, Although he, it was obvious, Could not be always at their house; That truly she had never thought Of marriage with him, but had sought His company because she found That days went far more blithely round In his society, than when She talked with ordinary men.” He said, when in due time his lips Could spare the leisure from their sips, “Your parents may think my demand And your surrender of your hand A trifle premature upon A four days' introduction. But four days are enough to show How pleasantly my life will go With you as help-mate, and you seem To know enough of me, to deem That I shall fairly well fulfil What you meant when you said ‘I will.’ A stranger in a far-off land Drifts till he finds a friendly strand In some fair, gentle girl like you To moor his wandering bark unto. Had I the loneliness but known Of living in strange lands alone, I should have wedded ere I left Rather than face it out, bereft Of father's, brother's, sister's face, Without a wife's to take their place. This is my answer to the world. If it with lip and nostril curled Hints that my suit was rather short, Your father's sanction I shall court With the fair rank I hold in life And proof that I can give a wife A decent, comfortable home, Though small enough to you who come From one like this. My plea to you Is that you represent my view Of gentle, graceful womanhood, Neither too clever nor too good, To be caressing when one's tired And like being petted and admired, Intelligent enough to take An interest in plans I make And what I write and what I do But not what Frenchmen call ‘a blue.’ Women of genius and those Who would their own impress impose On everything a husband does Should chose a husband like the wife Whom I invite to share my life Contented to appreciate, And seeking not to mould, their fate. There cannot in one household be Two-in-command and harmony. I have been candid with you, Lil, And told you how you so fulfil My beau-ideal of a wife. You have the merry pride of life, The beauty that allures the eye The grace of form and gait, the shy But never-failing sympathy, The easy, gracious courtesy, And tender girlish helplessness, And more that I can ill express.” December 29th—Sunday. Two persons we may feel quite sure Found that the morning air was pure, And wondered why folks slept away The nicest two hours in the day, Lil and her lover. Lil was drest, As suited the occasion best, In the same gossamery white Which first on Christmas-day saw light. The morn was young and so was she And both were fresh as fresh can be: 'Twas early summer in the year And early summer too in her, And nothing looks so apposite To early summer as pure white. He picked some fresh forget-me-not For her to wreath about her throat And now, as then, her slender waist With a broad pale blue sash was laced. Unless to scepticism slave, Behold an instance of brain-wave. For ere their blithe good-night they bade No word had Lil or Cobham said Of early rising. Yet they both, Though as a rule extremely loath To quit their bed's society, Were up in time to see the sky Grey with the promise of the dawn And the dew sparkling on the lawn, Each speculating on the chance Of a praeprandial romance. Had she been roguishly inclined She might have tried her lover's mind Being ‘en rapport’ of the plot And how t'would end, which he was not. But Lil was open as the day And rushed to him with glad “we may,” As soon as they were face to face Lending herself to his embrace, With some soft blushes as protest, And toss of her dishevelled crest When it was over. “Yes, we may,” Repeated she, nor drew away Her waist from his endearing arm, But yielded to the subtle charm, Which gentle women oft confess, Of feeling her own helplessness. “Last night, when we good-night had said, Before my father came to bed, I called my mother and disclosed The solemn fact that you'd proposed And I'd accepted wedded bliss, Subject to her consent and his, And begged the question of her own By confidently going on And asking her to intercede With Father and my cause to plead. Which she so eloquently did That he consented, subject to A satisfactory talk with you. And—was not dear old mother kind?— She stole to me to ease my mind With the good news before she turned T' enjoy the sleep she'd so well earned. “Father would like it, if you'd walk With him to church, to have the talk. He says that both of you will be Just twice as easy and as free, If you are in the open air, As cooped up in his study there, And that the motion will inspire Your words with swing if not with fire. I'm sure he will not be severe, But if he is, be patient dear, And talk him over—as you can If you are as expert with man.” The upshot of the walk was this That the dull sermon seemed like bliss To the Professor, for he sate To Lily most approximate And whispered to her a kill-care Before he breath'd his bidding pray'r. And when the ‘voluntary’ rose From the harmonium to close The service, kindly Mr Forte Asked—sotto voce—if Lil thought The walk would be too much for her (To rest him since he had walked there Was the excuse, although he went Backwards and forwards quite content On ev'ry Sunday of the year), And when the waggonette was clear Of greeting neighbours, he turned round And told what fairly might astound Miss Ridley, Madge, and Chesterfield, And Maud and Ida, who appealed For abnegation of the tale To Mrs Forte without avail. That Lil with Cobham walked alone Had indeed struck Maud Morrison, As rather odd, considering What kind folks say of such a thing, Nor could she the engagement eye Without some pangs of jealousy, Not that she envied Lil her lover (She'd have refused him three times over Had he addressed his suit to her), But in that Lil without demur The object of her choice had gained And every consent obtained. Maud was a pretty butterfly Whom all admired as she flew by But every man forbore to touch Lest she should crumble in his clutch. Besides to marry a poor belle, Who hopes to dress and drive out well, Need a long purse, and Midases Are fond of bachelorial ease. Ida was filled with pure delight, As she was ever, at the sight Of fresh-begotten happiness. Madge was too shy her thoughts t'express But a soft radiance filled the skies Of her magnificent blue eyes. Like Maud, Miss Ridley felt a pang From jealousy's envenomed fang That true love's course should be so smooth To some folks in their earliest youth, While others had to wait and wait, Poor suppliants at the feet of fate. She'd had a lover of her own Since dear old girlish days byegone, And that suggestive word ‘Engage’ Recalled a towered parsonage (Towered against the reiving hand Of Scotsmen) in Northumberland, Where a shy curate tried to tell The tale which Lil had liked so well. But soon the paroxysm passed Before a joy that was to last, That her pet pupil, whom she loved More than her own kin, thus was moved By one whom everyone approved. And Chesterfield, a bachelor Of forty-three or forty-four, Seized the occasion to descant On the advantages which haunt An early marriage, and went on In his own pleasing way to con All the Professor's pleasing traits And say the utmost in his praise. One good result did really come Of these two lovers walking home, That those, who had not been to church, Were not left blindly in the lurch But posted in the present state Of matters, ere they reached the gate. And doubtless they enjoyed the treat Of trudging through the dust and heat More than a comfortable seat In the paternal waggonette Where seven other persons met. Dinner on Sunday being at two Arose the question what to do In the whole hour, which intervened 'Twixt front door reached and soup tureened, Decided by a hint from Will That there might be some ‘cats’ to kill, Who, hearing the Professor vent Expressions of astonishment, Said that the victim slaughtered thus Was not the old domestic puss But native cat of ferret shape Which would not let one fowl escape, If it were left at liberty To ravage and to multiply. The trap in which the cats were snared Was a large wooden box prepared With inward sloping sides and lid Pierced with a drop, secured and hid With a long tunnel-fashioned top, Baited with meat above the drop. Will lifted off the lid and showed Three slender, sharp-nosed creatures, cowed And crouching to conceal themselves Under the overhanging shelves, And went to fetch his terriers. But when he'd seen their spotted furs Lil gave her lover's arm a pull; She was too soft and pitiful To witness even beasts of prey Being baited: Nor would Cobham stay Although he would have liked no doubt To see the rivals fight it out, As cat and dog proverbially Do when they meet in enmity. Two cats they coursed, of which the one Was caught and killed ere he had run A dozen yards, the other, given A longer start to make things even, Escaped into a firewood-stack. A ‘pup’ was then put in t' attack The third, a staunch fox-terrier Who did not show one sign of fear, Though he had not before this one Been set to face a ‘cat’ alone, But boldly grappled with his foe And would not whine or let it go, Although it made its sharp teeth meet Right through the skin of his forefeet. Near sundown in the afternoon They took the terriers for a run About the paddocks,—I should say All but the two betrothed, for they Wiled the delicious hours away Upon a rustic garden seat Secured from passing gaze and heat By a huge Wellingtonia's boughs Sloped downwards—a live summerhouse, With branches six feet from the ground Inside, and on the turf all round. The others sat down while the dogs Hunted or scratched at hollow logs And holes beneath the gum-tree roots For ‘possums,’ ‘cats,’ and bandicoots, And here and there a rabbit who Had not had time to get into His proper burrow. Once they were Attracted to a terrier Whose hind paws only could be seen His body being hidden in A fallen tree, whence after close And lengthy struggle, by the nose He drew an old buck ‘possum’ out Instantly set on by the rout And torn to pieces.—To resist Impossible.—And once there hissed An angry serpent from a log Stirred by a stick because no dog Would enter to drag out again A rabbit which had refuge ta'en. All vied in kindliness to Lil Her cup of ectasy to fill To overflowing. She had been So warm and gentle in her mien To everyone. The only chaff, Tempered by a disarming laugh, Was Kit's, who put it in this wise “It's not fair to monopolize The only safe man of them all Who may not, if he wants to, fall In love with us, with whom we can Enjoy ourselves like man with man, Without inspiring false alarms Of being victims to their charms. “Lil, you our benefactress are For thus disabling for the war Another of the skirmishers Hovering to cut off stragglers Who chance to fall out from the flanks Of the firm Amazonian ranks. “A woman can't be fair and free Without men fancying that she Acknowledges their kindling eye And irresistibility.” There was no story told that night, Not because Lil's new found delight Demanded leisure undisturbed, For 'twould have any how been curbed By Mr Forte's religiousness. He did not his religion press At point of bayonet down one's throat And did not quit his path to note Irregularities, which he, Walking straight forward, would not see. But when it came to yes or no He never doubted what to do. He was a man who served his Lord In deed, in thought, in will, in word, But held that ‘practice’ and not ‘preach’ Was the true Christian way to teach. December 30th. Before they went to bed, they'd made Arrangements for a fusillade Of waterfowl upon a lake Some six miles off and, for Lil's sake, Will had proposed that she should ride With the Professor by her side, Saying that he would bring a gun For him and bidding them ride on Because the ‘trap’ would overtake The riders ere they reached the lake, But if they reached it first to wait Below the hill-crest at the gate So that the ducks might not be scared Before the ambush was prepared. The dam was of a crescent shape With broad lagoons at either cape: But in the middle just a thread Of water filmed its muddy bed: And here the angle of a fence Gave a slight line of cover, whence An ambushed gun might be close to The mobs of ducks and swans which flew In terror towards the top lagoon When started from the lower one. And here Will posted Phil and Hall As really the best post of all, Although he thought that visitors Were likely to prefer the course Which he himself proposed to take Of stalking first the lower lake And then the upper, where they could See all the wildfowl-brotherhood Wading or floating on the mere And starting up as they drew near. Will had arranged that Kit should go With Phil and Hall knowing that so She would have better sport, which she Loved fully as devotedly As any gaitered gentleman Upon the Twelfth of August can. But she refused to, from a fear That Phil might prove sole cavalier. The party, who were left to stalk, After a minute's stealthy walk Over the low ridge of a hill, Burst on a spectacle to fill The least enthusiastic mind With rapture. The whole dam was lined With teal and divers, geese and swans And avocets and pelicans, With ducks of half the species known To colonists, ‘musk’ ‘black’ and ‘brown,’ Wood-ducks and mountain-ducks galore, Blue-wings and full a dozen more, With gulls and plovers on the shore And snippets at the water-edge, And bitterns rising from the sedge. As soon as they had topped the crest A swan, the sentry for the rest, Gave the alarm with one long note, Which still was ringing in his throat, When swish in one immense efflux Arose innumerable ducks Leaving just stray ones here and there For the gun-barrels brought to bear With instant swiftness on the spot, Where they had swam, with hail of shot. Kit bagged a brace of black-duck, Will Who hardly ever failed to kill A leash, and the Professor, who Missed with his first, with number two Brought down a swan so far that it Seemed quite impossible to Kit, While Chesterfield had the good-luck To find a diplomatic duck, Who'd rather take its chance and stay Among the reeds than fly away. But Phil and Hall, as Will had said, Enjoyed best sport, for overhead, Soon as the stalkers came in sight Of one lagoon, arose a flight, As thick as locusts, of huge flocks Of swans and geese and teal and ducks, One after other, steering for The far lagoon's remotest shore, Scarce noticing the ambush laid Beneath the fence's treacherous shade. Both were good shots and, when the last Of the migrating ‘mobs’ had passed, Some dozen dying birds and dead Lay on the ground or with sunk head Floated upon the shallow pool Which linked the two lagoons—so cool And calculating was the aim With which they timed the passing game. The stalkers, ‘sneaking’ round to try The far lake, found the ducks more shy And only shot a brace or two Of plover, while but few ‘mobs’ flew Over the ambush and those few So high as to be out of range. Then Will suggested as a change (Because the ducks would be too wild To be again that day beguiled, And more were lying dead than could Be eaten while their flesh kept good) That they should drive across and kill The rabbits swarming on the hill. But Lil and the Professor found Following plover round and round (She on her horse and he on foot In case he had a chance to shoot) More to their taste; nor did he find That he lost sport to stay behind, For several plover and a crane Soon fell, and once Lil drew her rein And pointed to a patch of grey Down by the water far away, And bade him draw his cartridges, And put in ‘eights’ instead of ‘threes,’ And steal up to the snippet cloud And fire both barrels and reload, In case a bittern should be scared Out of the reeds. He thus prepared, Two dozen ‘pipers’ bleeding lay Upon the sand, an easy prey, And, loading fast and aiming well, A huge, soft, mottled bittern fell Which rose up from the sedge as soon As the shot rang o'er the lagoon. He tried to stalk a pelican But ever since the sentry swan Had uttered his first warning note, They had not ventured within shot Or even sight. And half the while He hung upon Lil's radiant smile And fresh voice so attentively That many a wary duck flew by Unnoticed until out of reach, While he was making some sweet speech. Will, as he drove away, had cried That if they piled the game beside The fence 'neath which the ambush lay He would drive back again that way And bring it home—of course in jest, Not dreaming that the sporting zest Of the Professor would suffice Even one minute to entice His eyes from Lil's, when they were once Hidden behind a friendly sconce, And giving it no second thought, Though it was piled up to brought, For Lil had seen enough to tell How untrained horses hate the smell Of wild game, but did not perceive That Will was laughing in his sleeve. However, after dinner, she Turned the laugh on him gulelessly By asking where the bittern was, Which he'd brought home for them, because They wished to have it skinned. “Bittern?” He said not knowing where to turn “What bittern?” “Didn't you come back As you said, by the morning's track To pick the game up?” “Game up? No, You never thought I would, did you?” “Of course we did. We hung it up, Just where you told us, on the top Of the two fences, where they meet, Where Phil and Albert had their seat.” “You see what comes of chaffing, Will,” Observed his mother, asking Lil What they had left, and when she heard Their bag, remarked that she preferred Snippets on toast to any bird They'd shot in the whole morning's sport. Whether it was that Mrs Forte Was so inordinately fond Of snippets nicely trussed and browned Or wished mild censure to convey To Will for Lil, is hard to say. At any rate she was not wont Her likes and dislikes to recount At other times so forcibly. He only smiled, but by and by Went out and caught a horse, and drove The buggy to their treasure-trove, Which, just as they were off to bed, He brought back with diminished head Minus the bittern, which a ‘cat’ Had nibbled or a crow pecked at Till it could scarce be recognised For what poor Lil had so much prized. The tale was over long ere this, And Lil had had—well say one kiss In the large drawing-room, which all Abandoned to their beck and call. Lil was in raptures, she had not Deemed that her lover spoke or wrote So manfully as he had told The story of the stormed stronghold. She saw that like the Ithacan Whenever in his story ran Mention of “battles or of ships The whole man changed” and from his lips Poured such a stream of burning words That he who heard beheld the swords Dinted and red with their fierce play And white sails bending o'er the bay. The three poor soldiers of West Kent, Men of the Fiftieth Regiment, Standing upon the river-sands Awaiting but the staff commands To enter the Urumea, The struggle in the riverway, With ebbing tide and weedy rock, And then the first tremendous shock When they had gained the hostile banks And down on their devoted ranks, With not a stick of shelter nigh, Poured the fierce hail of musketry And canister and hand grenades, And when, above the palisades, They saw the glowing fire barrels And gleaming piles of mortarshells Upon the ramparts of the town, And then the order to lie down While the Trafalgar sixty-eights Breached traverses and parapets, And then that awful pause between With its exploding magazine, And then the ghastly, sickening glee Which the survivor of the three Showed in the storming, when he ran His bayonet right through the man Who'd killed his mate; and then the hell Which on the conquered city fell. Lil as he had his tale outpoured, Pictured him with a waving sword Urging his men into the breach With manful deeds and manful speech, And thought that he who thus could write Would be high-hearted in the fight, And yielded to his warm caress With the old pleasing consciousness Of helplessness when at his side Deliciously intensified; There had been nine that night in all, To hear the story; Phil and Hall Were playing billiards; Lachlan Smith Was marking, little pleased therewith, And Will had driven off to find The game which he had left behind. The barrister, who liked to hear The stories, had stayed out to cheer Maud Morrison, who need expect Little from Phil except neglect. But so Maud thought and chose to stay Rather than throw herself away, As she esteemed it, upon him If she should fail to win Phil's whim. Chesterfield had been chosen king. The subject of the evening Chosen by him was history, A battlepiece of days gone by. Accordingly the Oxford man In a few minutes' time began A lay of San Sebastian, First telling them that he designed The pieces that were shorter-lined As speeches of the Rank and File, And that the longer lines meanwhile Were narrative to tell the tale Where speeches only needs must fail. SAN SEBASTIAN, JULY 31st, 1813. A LAY OF THE RANK AND FILE. The three Common Soldiers. We be poor men, that stand Awaiting the command To march with bated breath To glory or to death; Nor know we well wherefore Our rulers went to war, Save that the name of French Has an unwholesome stench To the true British nose. We can well see our foes And all that they have done Against our coming on. That morning, ere the clock struck half-past ten, Down in the British trenches all the men Were under arms, waiting the bugle call To sound the storming-party to the wall. And as the tide was going down they viewed What well might daunt the sternest hardihood, The curtain high of solid masonry, With bastion and hornwork and glacis, The rampart fronting the Urumea And sweeping with its guns the riverway, And the retrenchments the besieged had made With gabion, fascine, and palisade Against surprise, or storm, or escalade. Long-sighted men could see the bayonets Glance in the sun behind the parapets, And cannon with their muzzles trained to bear Upon the breach, and piled shells, and the glare Of fire barrels along its summit ranged. 'Twere superhuman had no colour changed E'en in the most undaunted of them all, And had no brave men's knees begun to fall One on the other as they waited there. Anxiety unmans as much as fear. And these men had to loiter till the tide Of the Urumea should so subside That they might pass and press to the assault, And ev'ry moment of this enforced halt Saw the alert, resolute garrison Piling up gabion on gabion, All full of earth, and fascine on fascine, And mounting fresh guns on the ravelin. Time never seemed so sluggishly to move To lover waiting for his lady love As to these poor men, till they heard the “sound For the advance” upon the bugle wound, Although they knew not whether it was death Or medalled breasts for them, and laurel wreath For the commander that the call declared. 'Twas half-past ten when they drew up, prepared To pass the river when the tide was low, Some half hour later; mercilessly slow The minutes crawled, and as each one dragged by, Watches by scores, pulled out impatiently, Bore witness to the torture of suspense, As did sweat drops incessant and immense Upon the foreheads: Some men laughed aloud Like madmen: Others, many years too proud To bend before their Maker, strove to pray In infantile and incoherent way, Not unlike one who makes his first essay Upon the ice. The very elements Seeming to probe and augur the events That threatened, threatened too in sympathy. Dense thunder clouds wreathed and rolled in the sky Like cannon smoke, and now and then a flash Of lightning came before the general crash, Like the chance shot that, fired by some vedette, Brings on the action; and large drops of wet Fell as a spent shot on the rear guard falls, Fired at an outpost. Even animals Sniffed something in the air: the horses' ears Pricked and their nostrils quivered, and the steers Reiv'd by foraging-parties from the pass Ceased their contented munching of the grass. At last the bugle blew, And loud the clamour grew, As the head columns plunged into the stream, And French and English saw their “barrels” gleam. They'd still well nigh a furlong more to go Before they reached the outworks of the foe, Part over rocks on which men scarce could stand For slimy seaweed; part o'er open sand, Without a rise or scrub or pile of stones To shield the storming-party from the guns, Trained upon them from ev'ry embrasure By gunners skilful and themselves secure. One of the three Soldiers. Glad are we that at last That standing still is past, Counting the piles of shells And guns and fire barrels. “Waiting's like lead” say I; I think I'd rather die Than stand an hour more In rank upon that shore, Feeling my courage ebb As I made out the web They weave for us up there, Like spiders in their lair; Though the stream is too deep And it's so hard to keep One's footing to the bank. Three file slipped and sank Upon our right just now; But the tide's getting low. How these jagged rocks do cut Whene'er one slips one's foot, If one has a bad shoe; My right sole came in two As we marched down the glen Back from Soraoren. Ah! now it's sand we're on, I'm glad those rocks are done, They were so slippery With green seaweed, that we Could scarcely stand upright, Let alone march or fight. I wonder why the deuce They do not fire on us; We must be quite half way And all this time have they Not fired a single shot. It cannot be—they've not Retreated silently? By God, they have not. See! Full half our men are lower Beneath that with'ring shower Of canister and grape. Will none of us escape? Oh comrades, this is hell! Did you see that bombshell Blow half a company Into eternity? This hail of musketry Will kill each mother's son. Unless we can press on And make our escalades. Why they've fixed up swordblades Just where we should alight, Jumping down from this height; And we cannot stop here, Picked off by grenadier And marksman as we stand. It's no good to command Fresh men to our support, While this infernal fort Remains impregnable; They're just so much fuel For gunpowder and shot. The engineers should not Have pronounced the breach good; They never understood How strong these ramparts be. I do not think that we Can leave this place alive, However much we strive, That curtain is so high; But if we have to die, We'll let the foe know why, Although we have to go Over the blades below Up the face of that wall. We know we can but fall, Whether we stand or strike, And I, for one, should like To have the company Of a foe when I die. Come, messmates, don't despair, We have yet time to dare; We are the forlorn-hope And never should give up, While life and legs are left; That was a big hole reft In our ranks by that shell; 'Twas close to me it fell, And killed my right hand man, Poor Ben Ridge; he began Life with a better start: 'Twill break old Ridge's heart, Farmer Ridge of the mill. He's looking for him still At Yalding bridge, I'll bet, Hoping to see him yet Come back safe home again. He's sisters, too, poor Ben, Crying because he's roaming, And watching for his coming. Well, he has ceased to roam And gone to his long home. It will be my turn next, And nobody'll be vexed. No one at Paddockwood Thought I should come to good. I don't mind the shot now, I shall soon be laid low, And the sooner to rest. I never made a quest Of what will follow after Pain, lying still, or laughter. Hullo! there goes poor Shann, He was my left-hand man, And yet they don't take me, The worst man of the three. Well, he died best of all. He was right on the wall When he was bayoneted; I'll swear he wasn't dead When the brute tossed him down Upon the sword blades prone; And he'd a fair young wife, The star of my dark life, Pretty Marion Gill, The pride of Hunton Hill— Aye, and two little ones, To mourn his far-off bones, Bleached by Biscayan suns. Well! this Hell cannot last Long: it must soon be past, And we shall not know how. What did that bugle blow? “Cease Firing.” “Halt.” “Lie down.” The end will now be known. No, mates, be daunted not, All is not over yet; Did you see that roundshot Shiver the parapet? That was a Sixty-eight, I know it by the jar; And those men will fire straight— They fought at Trafalgar, And shot down hundreds four, And silenced ev'ry gun On the great Bucentaure, As they passed broadside on. The men were falling at the greater breach As fast as waves in winter on the beach; And at the lesser breach the Portuguese Fell thickly, as the suffocated bees Before the deadly and sulphureous blast; And succours added corpses, till at last Remained nought but to signal—“Halt,” “Lie down,” And, when the forlorn hope was lying prone, Over their heads to open fire once more, At once from Chofre's bristling lines the roar Of half a hundred great siege pieces burst, And beat the ramparts down till no foe durst Stay on the traverses that did command Th' assaulted parapet on either hand. And after no long time a mortar-shell, Fired with uplifted muzzle, downward fell Into the magazine of hand-grenades, Fire-barrels, and bombshells, and such like aids Wherewith the garrison had thought to hold Their last retrenchments if the battle rolled Over the breaches to the citadel. And all of these, the moment the bomb fell, Leapt up into the air in one bright flash, And with it smoke, and after it a crash— Just such a crash as when the Orient High into air that August night was sent When Nelson rode triumphant at the Nile; And now, as then, for full a minute's while With friend or enemy no cannon raged, But when the smoke and dust were part assuaged, With the appalling and unearthly cry The British ever raise when battle's high, The stormers leapt upon the first traverse. Yet even then the gallant tirailleurs Rallied, and on the top of the glacis The tide of conflict flowed as doubtfully As at the time when ebb and flood converge And neither gives nor gains, and the waves surge. Yet not for long—out-numbered and assailed With that mad stubbornness that has prevailed Against incredible odds in every clime, The French shrunk backward, and in no long time Over the lesser breach upon their flanks Fell the fierce Portuguese, and broke their ranks. The Soldier. I thought that Sixty-eight Would let them feel its weight; See how the parapet Is battered down by it. It can't be many hours Before the place is ours, From keep to waterline. My God! they've sprung a mine I'm not afraid to die But now—I don't know why— It seems so hard to go The moment that the foe Is likely to give in. I don't know what is sin, And don't know how to pray, And, if I knew the way, Don't know what good 'twould be. It seems an age to me Before we are blown up. O God that there were hope! No! I've escaped this brew, What was't the bugle blew? “Advance.” “Double.” “Charge!” now We'll pay them blow for blow. That was a rare old thrust That made him bite the dust. I heard the bayonet squish As it ripped through the flesh, And felt my barrel prest Right up against his chest: That pays for poor young Ridge Who lived by Yalding bridge. This thirsty bayonet Has Shann to pay for yet, And pretty Marion— Aye, and each little one. How thick the Frenchmen fall! Our blood's up, one and all, With standing neath that wall And being killed like sheep, While they stood on the steep, As safe as men in mail, Just waiting to impale Us as we strove to scale. 'Twas my turn to assault When the call sounded “Halt,” Or I should not be here. Why here's the grenadier That threw Shann's body down; I know him by the frown Made by a sabre scar Received in some old war. Perhaps he's not quite dead, He'd best be bayoneted; Take that, and that! I'll swear His eyes woke to a stare When first I ran him through: That's more than he will do When he's run through again. What is that? Have the foe Surrendered to our men? Then, comrades, to sack ho! O, surely ne'er shall phantasy recite, A tragedy to emulate that night; Mid houses sacked and flaming to the sky, Arose unintermittently the cry Of wives and tender maidens suffering The wrong of wrongs that poets blush to sing. Age shielded not, nor rank, nor unripe youth From lust of the outragers; nor did ruth Hinder from treading on a father's corse, Or bayoneting a husband's breast, to force The womanhood he strove from lust to shield. And to and fro the brutal soldiers reeled From drink to rape, and rape to drink again, Like fiends let loose from Hell, rather than men, As, mad with liquor and befouled with blood, They hurled with frantic glee into the mud Pictures and plate, and antique jewellery, And rich apparel, and rare tapestry, As they had been so many packs of wool, And drank raw spirits by the bonnet-full As they got up the kegs, and stove them in With hideous triumph and more hideous din, And mingled the fierce fluid with the gore Of all who said them nay, or stood before The drunkard or seducer at his work. While with wan glare the frequent lightning-fork Put the tall flames in shade and made the scene Look trebly devilish, and, in between, The thunder crashes drowned the voice of crime. In gentler times, it well might look sublime To see the flashes point the Pyrenees And multiply reflections on the seas; But now it seemed as if the Powers of air Thundered in sympathy, and came to share In the new Hell. In vain the officers, In spite of mutinous and gnashing curse, Strove to rein in the men, and form again Into some order, and as much in vain Spoke of the Castle, yet intact, where lay With fresh battalions the undaunted Rey, Waiting, perchance, to fall upon the foe, And retribution wring for that day's woe. The men, unmoved, murdered and pillaged on And outraged, amid moan, and moan, and moan. The Soldier. You, sir, pray where were you, You with your epaulettes, When from the parapets The grape rained down and slew Us poor chaps by the score? I daresay with the staff Upon the further shore, Having a sneering laugh At some unfeeling jest, While we poor devils, prest Upon the open sand, Went down hand over hand. You call us savages— So'd you be an' you please, If you'd been penned all day And shot and shot away Without striking a blow, And seen a bloody foe Toss on the pikes below The bodies of your friends Before they met their ends. Don't talk to me of wives! Did they think of Shann's wife When they tossed down poor Shann On the pikes, a live man? Don't talk to me of lives, Tell me! wasn't Shann's life Worth any enemy's? Will she have dryer eyes Than a Frenchwoman would? What'ud her womanhood Have been worth if they'd won, And then had fallen on Her in a conquered town? Because her eyes are brown Would they have let her go? Would a bosom of snow Have hindered them, forsooth, From soiling her fair youth? Man, man, we are but men, Though we wear a red coat And march into a moat Twenty feet deep and drown, If we are ordered down In battle's hour. But when The battle's o'er and won, A chap must have his run; And harkee, sir, I will. Pull out your sword and kill Me, an' you like, who stood Against the French all day; I can't fight, an' I would. I threw my piece away, And can no weapon get Except a bayonet. “Drink” did you say? Why not? I haven't had a pot Of drink this long month's space. “Drunk!” you know by my face! Well, and if I were worse, I shouldn't care a curse. I've done my work to-day, And mean to have my play. “Murder!” Didn't they kill Poor Ridge, of Yalding Mill With a bursting bombshell, While we were in that hell Under their parapet, Before the Sixty-eight Smashed up the traverses? Are their lives more than his? I ran through my first man For throwing down poor Shann; The next for young Ben Ridge, And the next for old Ben That lives by Yalding bridge, One for each sister, and then Two for Shann's bonny wife, And took a Frenchman's life For either little one. I didn't stop to count How many more went down When first we stormed the town. Lord! how the blood does mount When one gets a fair rush And a bayonet push After standing for hours Riddled with steady showers Of grape and canister. No offence to you, sir, But men will be men here: And not to interfere Is all that you can do, And no disgrace to you, Nothing will cure to-night But the chill of daylight. Will asked the two betrothed to stay After the rest had gone away, Wishing to make apologies About the bittern's obsequies, And after these were laughed off, all Lingered awhile about the hall. It seemed so odd to Will to think That Lil, who yet was on the brink Of girlhood and of womanhood, Was soon to leave their home for good. To him she still was just a child As bright, ingenuous and wild, And he was curious to see Her with her lover quietly To form his own conjectures of Their future happiness and love. Reader, observe the tender touch Of nature which delights so much. To Lil it was a luxury To sit upon her lover's knee Before her brother openly. It showed her that the love she prized Was regular and recognised. She knew that if it did look bold No human being would be told, As far as Will's tongue was concerned, And her soft heart within her burned To symbolise in outward ways The love which so fulfilled her days. December 31st. To-day they voted a battue And hunt among the kangaroo. Himself a horseman bold and good As very few who ever rode, Will on the hunt cold water threw. “At all events it would not do For the Professor, or indeed For Chesterfield, to ride full speed Through the thick scrub with fallen trees And rabbit-burrows thick as bees. And he would be much loath to lend His worst horse to his dearest friend For such a freak. Of course if Lil And Kit and Margaret and Phil Liked to ride their own nags they could, Or lend them just as they thought good. But in his judgment it was best— At any rate he would suggest— To get a shooting-party up, And send some men ahead to stop And some men back to drive the game Right past. He knew the tracks they came To drink and feed, and easily Could post guns just where they passed by.” “Why not do both?” asked Kit, who was Ready upon the slightest cause To ride wherever there was risk Of breaking neck or limb, as brisk In courting danger as her wit Was ready in eluding it. “Why not do both? We might divide Some post ourselves, and others ride To help the men. I volunteer.” “And I,” cried Phil just after her, Fired with the possibilities Which might from the rencontre rise (And which shrewd Kit had duly weighed But thought she could contrive t'evade On plea of ‘beating’ properly Whenever he came too close by). Phil lent the horse which Hall rode on, First offered to Maud Morrison, Who rode sometimes but “did not care,” So she said, meaning “did not dare” To ride that day. The only one Who did not go but would have gone Was Lil, who as above was told When upon horseback was as bold As she was timid otherwise. But she was met with pleading eyes By the Professor, when she glanced In question, and discountenanced. The bare idea of the ride His active fancy terrified With nightmare dreams of accidents, Nor did he like experiments. Will, a good bushman, knew each track The kangaroo would likely take When beaten up, and spread his force At vantage-points along the course. He took the first point, that his gun Might warn the others. Further on Was Chesterfield, and Lachlan Smith Still further. Lil was posted with Her lover—one good reason was That they enjoyed it, one because Lil bred to country life had eyes More open to its mysteries Than the Professor, and the two Were posted last, because Will knew That folks so prepossessed as they Might hear a gun go off all day And hardly notice. While they lay Crouched in the fern, they watched the life With which the forest depths are rife,— The cold snake coiling in the sun On any open space; the dun And drowsy ‘native bear’ at ease, Wedged in high forks of lofty trees; The blue and scarlet lory sitting Close by his much-loved mate, or flitting With a discordant scream between The ‘lightwood's’ dense and sombre green, Rivalled in his metallic blue By ‘warbler’ cock ‘superb’ in hue, But little as a common wren With a most unpretentious hen; The jackass, perched upon a branch Of a bare gum-tree, who would launch From time to time unearthly peals Of laughter, watching as it steals And darts alternately, his prey, The common lizard, while there lay Seemingly sleeping in the heat, A huge iguana 'neath his feet. The insect-world was everywhere,— Flies and mosquitoes in the air, Tyrannical and trumpeting; Spiders of all kinds ravelling In filmy threads each bush and tree; Ants all round far as one could see Pursuing their eternal march, Coming and going through an arch Made by two pebbles in the ground, Or crossing a ravine profound, Nothing so little or so great To baffle them—as stern as Fate. But strange! in all the hum of life With which the forest-morn was rife, No single note of song was heard Like that the yellow-billed, black bird Raises when cherries turn to red In Kent: nor aught was heard instead Save the deep-throated native thrush Calling out from the leafy bush Of some tree-top his ‘who are you,’ Clear-toned but tuneless, and the new Incomparable chant, bell-like Resounded by the magpie-shrike. At last they came, the kangaroo, Not in a drove but one or two, And these not the great ‘foresters’ But small ‘brush-kangaroo,’ with furs Of reddish tinge, not that there was A dearth of them there but because The riders, five of them in all, Two men and Phil and Kit and Hall Had failed to keep the proper line Which constituted Will's design. Phil was in fault: he was to ride Upon the left on the outside The shooters being on the right And the ‘stops’ posted opposite. And this was how it came about: Kit was next Phil and he fell out, Attracted by her pretty face, To be near her; and thus a space Was left uncovered on the left By which the game with instinct deft Broke sideways out of the cordon. Only a few were hurried on, In their blind flight unnoticing The gap left open on the wing, And Will had settled two of them, And Chesterfield one after him, Bringing them down to one or two, Which scarcely as much leapt as flew, So scared were they when they came up To where the last gun had to stop. He fired two cartridges away After the heltering-skeltering prey Without result, and then crouched still Until he heard a shout from Will Calling to lunch, which he discussed With pleasure, tempered by disgust Attendant on his ill-success,— Doomed to be transient none the less. Lunch over, when the rest had gone Partly to leave the two alone, Partly to try the ground once more In the same order as before Beginning from the other side, With Phil and Kit told off to ride On the two flanks to quite prevent Any such tender incident As that which spoiled the morning's sport. The morning had left Philip Forte More hopelessly in love than e'er With Kit. She looked so queenly fair In her close-fitting habit made Of light-grey tweed; and in the glade With her blood dancing as she rode Full speed, no mortal woman could Maintain an iciness of mien; The magic of the time and scene And motion lured her back into A mood that really was her true And natural mood, and she received Advances with what he believed Was wakening love, but which in truth Was just the heartiness of youth Laid open with excitement's wand. In course of time the lovers fond The old adage did illustrate, That he who can afford to wait Must win. For, as they sat at ease Under the overhanging trees On cushions from the waggonette, Still lingering where lunch was set, One of the horses tethered near Began to snort and prick his ear. Lil, a good bushman, noticed it, And bade him load his gun and sit As still as death, and soon the sound Of a dull thud upon the ground Confirmed suspicions, and there hopped Almost to where they were, and stopped, Looking about suspiciously At the strange sights which met its eye, A full-grown ‘old man’ kangaroo. “Shoot it,” said Lil, and full and true Into its head her lover poured A charge of buckshot, on the sward Dropping his prey, without a kick As stiff and lifeless as a stick. Lil first felt glad that it was shot, And then she wished that it were not. Glad that her lover had obtained What he so much desired, and pained For the poor beast, whose great dark eyes Pled mutely for her sympathies. At last she gave adherence to Her lover, not the kangaroo. Ida was queen that night, and made Her choice of subject ‘Love,’ and bade The lover concentrate his tale Not on the female but the male. “You've given us a picture of A pretty English girl in love In Ethel. Show us if you can The feelings of an Englishman In the same sweet predicament.” “Bravo!” exclaimed with one consent Kit and the statesman, and the first Whispered, “I did not think she durst, Has not she splendid impudence To sally thus at his expense?” Cobham took refuge in a smile, And, thinking for a little while, Gave them a tale half revery And half of it reality. SAPPHO. (A REVERY.) The full moon glitters on the sand, The North Sea ripples on the strand, The low cliff's shadow from above Falls on a little landlock'd cove, Which, deep and dang'rous to the edge, Mines underneath the chalky ledge, Save where the bank, with gentle sink, Slopes downward to the water's brink. Here Harold stood: the night was clear, And through the purple atmosphere The stars shone brightly, and the sea Sang chorus to his rhapsody: A man whom all might happy deem, And women love, and men esteem; Full broad of shoulder, strong of arm, And deaf to anger or alarm, But chivalrous in hastiness To champion trouble or distress; As great in spirit as in frame, In danger and distress the same, With wild, dark, handsome, haunting face— And strength in manhood serves for grace: Able was he to hold his own, And worthy admiration; Accustom'd since he scarce could stand To the stern pastimes of his land: At first to shoulder off the stool The other little boys at school, And then to wrestle and to fight With ten-year rivals, his delight; Then competition took the place Of stand-up fighting face to face; There were brave battles to be fought In beating other boys at sport; And as the rolling years went on Great glory in such sports he won; Fours to true leg, straight spanking drives Snick'd twos and threes, clean cuts for fives, Fast ripping balls, well on the wicket, Made him renown'd in Rugby cricket. Hot ‘hacks’ exchanged, ‘tries’ dearly bought; A hero in the sterner sport. He'd stalk'd the red deer over Highland rocks; He'd ‘taken’ untried fences for the fox; In Kentish copses, 'neath an autumn sun, The largest bag had fallen to his gun; In Norway rivers, waist-deep in the flood, Salmon of weight had yielded to his rod: Alone, afoot, on many a weary day, O'er steep wet moor and featureless highway, He strode to fields of unforgotten fights Of Rupert's cavaliers and Clifford's knights; To storied castles shatter'd in the war 'Twixt Crown and Commons, minsters where of yore Dunstan and Baeda fed the sacred light Of learning in the long dark English night; To abbeys rich with knightly founders' bones, And gifts of bygone heroes and kings' sons; To great cathedrals hallow'd by the pray'r Of great dead men; to cities famed and fair; To torrents foaming, fretting, falling fast, And mighty rivers slowly sailing past By stately halls and immemorial trees; To lonely wolds and humming village leas, Green downs, and grey gaunt mountains, and broad plains Strewn with old chieftains' tombs and fallen fanes; To silent reed-fring'd lake and lone sea-shore, As silent, save for surf and storm wind's roar. He knew the names of all known stars in heaven— The heralds of the morning and the even; He knew the names of all the birds that fly, And beasts that range beneath the Northern sky, And many fish that in the north seas ply; He knew the gauzy denizens of air, And had a hoard wherein the rich and rare Of daily butterfly and nightly moth Were ranged together, and he knew in troth The name of every flow'r that wood and field From Cornwall to Northumberland do yield. Ballads he knew, and many a legend old In knightly Kent and daring Devon told, And many a border-boast and roundelay Sung in the good green wood: these he would say Word by word, line by line, and verse by verse, After the croonings of a fond old nurse, Who had nought else to teach him: these he knew, And sought out many other when he grew, In dingy quarto bought at fusty stall Or 'neath old cottage prints fantastical. Oft far into the night he converse held With the great minds and noble hearts of eld— Caedmon and Mallory, and old Geoffry, The sire and sieur of English poesy; Spenser and More and Shakspere, England's voice, In whom the ears of ages shall rejoice; Sweet Sidney, Beaumont, Fletcher, ‘rare old Ben,’ And glorious Milton, brave John Bunyan, Pepys, Evelyn, Clarendon, Addison, Dick Steele, Defoe and Swift—these he would con, And Keats and fairy Shelley, who could tell The sadness of all happiness too well; And Landor, he to whom 'twas given to show The longings and the life of long ago. And often to these meetings at midnight Came old school friends he'd studied with delight, Not diligence: Homer the editor, And Hesiod the old, and many more; Dear babbling, loosely-learn'd Herodotus, Euripides, Sophocles, Æschylus, Plato and Aristotle; and the soft Anacreon came with them; nor less oft Came sage Lucretius and Cicero, Virgil and witty Horace, Gallio And legendary Livy; oft too came The second sire of poetry—a flame From his own Hell was burning in that breast, Whence the triunal vision was express'd— Condemn'd, his love unknown and dead, to roam In poor and painful exile from his home. And with him came Messer Boccaccio, Full of the loves and jests of long ago; And many a bard who'd listed to his tales, And sung them o'er again, and one from Wales, And one from Alcalà, and many more Whose names were writ in fire, in days of yore. And sometimes, when he heard the stirring hum Of music or great shoutings, there would come Heroes and hosts: Herman and Hannibal, Etzel, the Cid, Roland of Roncesvalles, Harold of Hastings, Richard Lion-heart And Edward the Black Prince; nor far apart, Hawkins and Drake, Raleigh and Frobisher, And the great Howard, Ironside Oliver And his Ironsides, and Rupert, hand-on-sword, And Buonaparte, and he who cross'd the ford Against advice and conquer'd on that day When he won Plassey and England India; And those Six Hundred heroes. And at times, Releas'd by midnight's necromantic chimes, Came the true lovers and wild souls of yore— Dauntless Medea, one from Naxos' shore, Helen and light-heart Paris, Psyche true, Aspasia and the masterman who drew More glory from her sweetness than the sway Of Athens in her hour, and Thaïs gay, Who ruled the world's commander: with these came Dido and lone Iarbas, hearts of fame, That lov'd at odds; and some of later name— Abelard, Heloïse, and Rosamond, And Castile's Eleanor, whose love was found Proof against poison, and the Florentine Who bore deep graven on his heart divine The little maid twice seen through years of power And years of pain: and many a rare hour Came the white Queen of Scots. Here all who fell Victims to service true, or lov'd too well, Were welcome, for his wild heart long'd to know Such love as beauty tender'd long ago. Indeed, he ev'ry gift could boast But the three gifts he valued most— Wealth to pet beauty, beauty's self, Won for his own sake, not for pelf, And laurels of a poet: he Enough had tasted of all three To thirst for more. To many a maid His fancy'd for a moment stray'd; Blue eyes and hazel, grey and brown, Had answer'd frankly to his own; Auburn and flaxen, black and gold, Had mesh'd his heart in glossy fold; But ever came an undertone Of something wanting in each one. The lady of his choice should be Sublime in her simplicity, Of lowly mind and high estate, And fairy-light in grace and gait; One who would try to understand Whate'er he wrote, whate'er he plann'd; With fitful anger for defence Against abus'd obedience, And just sufficient patience To obviate unjust offence; With beauty intellectual, The rarest witchery of all, And curly clustering wealth of hair Indented by a forehead fair, And broad and creamy; thoughtful eyes, Open in innocent surprise, Melting in pity, fired in wrath, Pouring the soul's whole secret forth In love, not unacquaint with tears. She must have tender girlish fears, And a soft voice, with elfin mirth, And presence equal to her birth; She must be coy—the more they cost More dear they are, the dearest most; But when she yields let her confess With all the gentler tenderness, And hungry kiss and hot caress. Passion and love walk hand in hand: Content is imitation bland For widowers and second wives, And men whose ledgers are their lives; Youth's passion-flow'r is delicate And, blighted, blossoms not till late. Sooth'd by the sweet salt soughing breeze, He linger'd over shapes like these, Now peering from the ledge above Into the clear depth of the cove, Now gazing upward at a star, And now across the sea afar, To a lithe schooner-yacht that lay, Nodding her slim masts, on the bay; When suddenly he heard the plash, And saw the phosphorescent flash Of dipping oars, and then a skiff, Making the shore beneath the cliff. A muffled lady and old man Sat in the stern-sheets; soon it ran To where the coast with gradual sink Sloped downwards to the water's brink. The old man rose, and lightly sprung Ashore, and safe. The shallop swung Just as his daughter leapt, and she Sank in the clear depth of the sea; She swerv'd and sank without a sound, And as she fell the scarf unwound That veil'd her features, and laid bare A sweet fair face and gold of hair Crowning it; as she sank she smiled, And shot a glance intense and wild Up at the ledge where Harold stood. He in a strange ecstatic mood Was gazing downwards at the flood, And the wet face, which seem'd to be That of a goddess of the sea. Then in he plung'd, she gripp'd his arms And, in the terror that disarms The mind of reason, dragg'd him down, As Sirens in the legend drown The victims of their song. He thought in that short minute's space Of his long start and ill-run race, Of all the waste and wrong That crowded in his misspent life, Of all the soarings and the strife Of his foreshorten'd day, Of ev'ry uncompleted aim, Of unachiev'd desire of fame, And chances slipp'd away: And ere his senses lost control He thought of his immortal soul, And felt he could not pray. The Dream. He, standing by the landlock'd cove, Built airy palaces of love, And, leaning over, strove to peer Beneath the starlit waters clear, When suddenly arose a maid Out of the depth, and, unafraid, Swam near him, and in sweet, soft voice Bade Harold welcome, and rejoice. “At last,” she said, “my love, thou'rt come: Thou hast been long away from home.” He look'd at her, but could not tell What maid it was that lov'd him well, And said, “Who are you, sweet?” but she— “Wilt thou renew thy cruelty, Erst cruel Phaon? know'st thou not Thy bride, thy Sappho? From my grot Beneath the ocean oft have I Gazed upward at the shore and sky To see thee once again; and now Thou'rt come. I pray thee, dear heart, vow That thou wilt ne'er forsake me more For idle dalliance on the shore, But seek in love's unfailing arms A shelter from the world's alarms, And pillow'd on a white warm breast Lull thine o'er-labour'd head to rest.” He edg'd a step toward the cove, Irresolute 'twixt life and love; She swam a stroke toward the shore, Pleading and beckoning the more, And said, “I loved those wilful curls As none among the Lesbian girls: No maid in Mitylene'd prize Gems, as I prized those glad brown eyes— I, who the love of man defied, Offered my beauty to your pride, And you despised it; then I wail'd And all my joy in living fail'd, And oft I sought a lonely rock That quiver'd with the billows' shock, And bore my burthen to the breeze, And sang my sorrows to the seas; And last I plung'd, in hope to be Reprieved by death from misery. “But the mermen pined for the love of me, As I sang to the sea and sky; And those who are loved by kings of the sea May be drown'd, but cannot die. “Their kisses I loath'd, and I loath'd their love, The more as they prov'd more true; And all the day long I would rove and rove, Watching and waiting for you. “Then lay down your weary head in my arms, And you shall a merman be, And reign as a king in the careless calms Of the fathomless sapphire sea.” Harold. “But I have joys I cannot leave: The glow of morning and of eve, The glory of the noon; The golden sun that shines on high, The stars embroider'd on the sky, The silver of the moon.” Sappho. “But the sun shines through the breast of the blue, And moon-finger'd waves are fair, And the stars we view reflected anew On the gold of mermaid hair.” Harold. “But I have other joys than these: The cliffs and mountains, and the breeze That freshens round their tops; The valleys with their kirtles green, The uplands with their shoulders sheen And coronal of copse.” Sappho. “There are hills and valleys below the deep Far fairer than any of earth; And the winds of your mountains wake and sleep, In the ocean that gives them birth.” Harold. “But I have fairy flow'rs that rise Fresh from their winter obsequies To decorate the spring; And others of a later day To grace the summer, and delay The autumn's taking wing.” Sappho. “The sea-flowers are more glorious far, And they never sleep or die; Our anemones wear the shape of a star, And hue of a sunset sky.” Harold. “And I have groves whose living shade Is canopy and colonnade Beneath an August sun; Choice garden trees with fruitage fine, And evergreens that never pine When August days are done.” Sappho. “And under the sea there are gardens sweet, And coral groves red and white; We know not the changes of cold and heat. But love the sun for his light.” Harold. “The birds I love so fleet and fair That glitter through the sunny air, And warble in the dawn; The insect-radiance of May, Whose dotage closes with the day That saw their brightness born.” Sappho. “We have beautiful shapes and tuneful shells In our wondrous world below; But the glories of ocean no one tells, And none but the mermen know.” Harold. “But most of all I love to stand On each grey castle of our land, And nodding Norman keep, Telling with scatter'd walls and scars A rugged tale of great old wars And warriors long asleep: To muse on moss-hid arch and aisle Of desecrate Cistercian pile And fane of long ago; To wander through a village street Trod by a great man's childish feet While yet his lot was low; To gaze across a moor whereon A famous victory was won Or some stout hero fell; And often have I fondly roved Where two wild lovers met and lov'd, Not wisely, but too well.” Sappho. “We have no castles in ruin revered, No abbeys of long ago, No villages where great men were rear'd While yet their lot was low. But we have some rare old battle-grounds Where heroes were kill'd at bay, And buried chiefs without burial mounds, And trystings of lovers gay. Then lay down your wearied head in my arms, And you shall a merman be, And reign as a king in the careless calms Of the fathomless sapphire sea.” Harold. “But under the sea, love, under the sea, What do you do for the clear blue sky?” Sappho. “O! the clear blue sea is a sky to me, And our heaven is not too high.” Then in he plung'd: she drew him down, As sirens in the legend drown The victims of their melody. The waters gurgled in his ears, He deem'd that he must die; But Sappho sooth'd away his fears With kisses wooingly. Down, down they sank until they reach'd A sapphire-vaulted cavern beach'd With jet and shells of pearl; the walls Were cataracts and waterfalls. Here they abode full lovingly, And smoothly the quick days sped by. Sometimes he sits upon the rocks, Upgathering her elfin locks; Sometimes she sits upon his knee, And sings him anthems of the sea; Sometimes upon the sand he lies, Gazing at sea-blue steadfast eyes That concentrate on him; And sometimes for an hour's space He dallies with a fair, fond face And body rounded slim. She tells him legends of the deep, And shows him where the mermen keep Their fleet of founder'd ships, And where their milliard army lies Of skeletons with hollow eyes And grinning jaws for lips. But most of all she's used to tell Of those old hours she lov'd so well, The hours of Lesbian song; To call back some sad roundelay, That wiled away an elderday Whereon he linger'd long; To call back how it sooth'd to rove, And tell the breezes of her love And waters of her woes; To whisper consummated bliss, And seal her whisper with a kiss, And sink in sweet repose. Thus sped they many a joyous day In amorous and peaceful play, Glad of a respite from the fears Of eager and ambitious years. But last it fell that Sappho's cheek Grew hollow and her body weak: He saw and griev'd until she broke The silence, and the dull truth spoke: “We have no souls, dear love, For had we souls we could not live Without the elements that give The life they live above— The daily drink, the daily fare, The sweet and all-sustaining air.” “What matter,” he cried, “though we have no soul We shall live as long as the earth, Without the millstone of care and control Which hangs round the neck from birth. “We have all the wonders of deep and bay, And the heaven is ours above, As much as the mortals who toil all day And have only the night for love. “And if no future in heaven be ours When the earth is ended, we've this— We can make a heaven of earthly hours, And sweeten our end with a kiss.” Sappho. “Though love is good and gracious ease, Life is for nobler ends than these: To build impregnably a name And force unwilling grants from fame; To gain great victories, and give A wise example how to live; To give your country liberty, Or teach her patriots how to die; To chronicle your finest thought For generations to be taught; With practice and with preaching win A sinful people from their sin, To point your tale and wing your song As arrows against wrath and wrong.” Though he for love and ease was fain, His nobler nature woke again: “Teach me, my love,” he said, “once more To win the souls we had before, What toils attain, what pains restore.” “It is writ in the Book of the Sea,” she saith, “That a merman a soul may gain Who snatches the life of a man from death Or a maiden's love can attain.” Then to the landlock'd cove they swam, And when they to the inlet came He saw a drowning maiden sink In the clear depth beside the brink. He seem'd to clasp her, as before, And bear her breathing to the shore, And, lo! the maid in his embrace Wore Sappho's form and Sappho's face.The End of the Dream. He woke: beside his pillow stood More perfect in her womanhood The lady of his vision, Her lips half parted for a smile In sweetest indecision, Whether to fly or bide the while He ask'd of his position. She stay'd: it needs no Chaldee seer Or Arabic astrologer To guess their conversation; The meaning of the mystery Needs no interpretation; We leave the after-history To your imagination. The first time that they were alone After this tale of his was done, Lil questioned him if he were not Himself the hero of the plot. To which he answered, “No indeed I am no hero, but I read The kind of books I make him choose, And like the same things as he does.” That evening they had a dance, Due chiefly to the circumstance That Phil was so in love that he Had come and listened patiently Right through the tale to be with Kit, And had, when Cobham finished it, Suggested dancing in the hope That she might be induced to stop As a spectator, purposing When he had “done the proper thing” By waltzing a few rounds, to watch His opportunity to catch Her at some moment, when so placed That she could hardly with good taste Leave him, and then to make best use Of what the parley might produce. Kit saw the danger, yet scarce knew What there remained for her to do, The clicking of a billiard-ball Told her that Lachlan Smith and Hall Were playing billiards, so that she Could not go thither decently. She felt that Phil would follow her And hang about her everywhere, So, when she saw him pause, she went Dnd much to Will's astonishment Asked him if he would care to dance, Believing this her only chance. She knew that if she danced with Will She might be forced to dance with Phil, But then one need not hear a word Excepting of one's own accord When one is dancing, and she meant, When it was over, to prevent A confidential tête-à-tête By asking him to take her straight To the piano to express Her overpowering thankfulness To the musician—there to stay, Chatting the interval away Until another dance began, As fixed as is Aldeboran. The plan succeeded and did not, Like many things which wise folks plot. Phil could not have his tête-à-tête And Kit but hurried on her fate. Of course as soon as she and Will Their dance had finished, up came Phil With Maud upon his arm to ask That he might have the next—a task Which Maud by no means liked, and Kit As little liked the granting it. Kit's dancing, as the reader knows, Was perfect in its stately pose And docile movement, light of tread And true of step, with the fair head Carried as though she were a queen Although so gracious in its mien Phil looked a thorough gentleman, And danced so well as few men can, And Kit artistic pleasure drew From dancing with her foe, so true And perfect was the unison With which they moved, that everyone (Excepting poor Maud Morrison, Who could not to herself deny Her own inferiority) Paused to look on with praise unfeigned, Lil above all, who thought her friend The autotype of elegance, And bade her lover ask a dance, Saying that Kit danced best of all The girls she'd seen at school or ball, Which seemed to him a reason why He should not with her wish comply. “She will not care to dance with me, I can't do the new step, and she Does it so irreproachably.” “Kit can dance all,” was Lil's reply, “And so could Maud if she would try, And Kit is far too highly bred To speak as rudely as Maud did.” So he asked Kit, who answered “yes” With such a frank sweet graciousness, Adapting her own step to his So furtively and with such ease That he was ready to endorse Lil's eulogy with tenfold force. Kit was a girl who if she chose Might have led most men ‘by the nose,’ And she her safety found to-night In coming down from her cold height, And being womanly to all, Which gave her a brief interval From present dread, but hurried on The climax. Phil danced off and on With her throughout the evening, In every fibre quivering With a new sense of fierce delight, Interpreting the opposite Of her intentions, and in fear Lest he should not obtain her ear While she was in this gentle mood. Poor Kit! Anticipations wooed That which she strove to guard against. Poor Phil! who dreamed they evidenced Surrender and not armament. And yet both went to bed content, She that she'd beaten off the foe, He that he'd but to strike the blow To find the fortress at his feet On any terms which he thought meet. January 1st. In Melbourne the great “Champion” Upon each New-Year's day is run, And every little country town Likes to have races of its own Or sports or fairs upon that day. Some half-a-dozen miles away Was a small place to which the Fortes Went every year to see the sports. The sports were nothing much to see, But it bred cordiality Between them and the people round If they were seen upon the ground. And Will was judge, because he'd been “A C. U. A. C. Blue.” I.e., one of the representatives of Cambridge University in the Inter-University Athletic Sports at Lillie Bridge. The scene, If not attractive to the eye, Presented a variety:— Merry-go-rounds, and galleries For rifle shooting with a prize Which no one ever won, potshots A penny each at cocoa-nuts, Aunt Sally, try-your-strength-machines, And here and there, behind the scenes, The ‘three-card trick,’ ‘hat-trick,’ ‘roulette,’ And other snares by sharpers set The simple country folk to gull, Though dupes were not too plentiful. And then there were the usual shows— Fat women, dwarfs, gigantic sows, A six-legged calf, and mermaid stuffed, The whole inordinately puffed. The sports were mostly handicaps Distinguished chiefly by the traps Which runners from a distance set Undue advantages to get. In nearly every race some tried To have some one disqualified For false name, false performances, Or other insincerities. The handicap draws larger fields, But in most other ways it yields To open contests for the best. Handicaps are no real test. All that they generally mean Is that the handicapper 's been Ill-posted on the winner's form. You could distinguish by the storm Of acclamations which outburst When local runners came in first. For educated lookers-on There would not have been any fun, But for an aboriginal Who started (without fees at all) For every race—one of the wrecks Whom white men's vices, without checks Which white men have, were dragging down Post-haste to his perdition, A blear-eyed, whiskey-sodden wretch, Often too tottering to fetch A pail of water to a horse. He almost reeled about the course— A contrast to the crowd, who were Far soberer and steadier Than such a crowd oft is elsewhere. The crowning merriment was when This poor degraded specimen Of the old rulers of the place Had started in a hurdle race, And, jumping too close, sat upon The hurdle-rails as he came down. But only Will of all the Fortes Paid much attention to the sports. Phil was too busy with his suit, Kit with contrivances astute To fence it off. Lil and her lover Wished to go ere it was half over, And the rest scarce attended more Than did the interested four. The two old folks had stayed at home, Thinking it better not to come, The neighbours being quite content If any of their party went. Ida had grappled Chesterfield, Who seemed agreeable to yield. Indeed the cheerful little dame, Always so kind, always the same, And always fashionably dressed (In fashions that became her best), Was calculated to engage A politician of his age And corrigible bachelor No less, if not indeed much more, Than a mere girl whose prettiness Was her sole claim to his address. And these two bandied chaff all day In what Will called a reckless way, When he came back to steal a munch Of their drawn-out, luxurious lunch. The barrister was trying on Blandishments with Maud Morrison, But found her less amenable Than juries whom he handled well. For firstly, Maud (who, if 'twere known, Knew nought of her own race) looked down Upon his humble origin; And secondly, she was not in The best of tempers, seeing Phil, Whom she thought so adorable, Wasting attention upon Kit, Who barely tolerated it. Hall talked to Madge, or rather both Sat by each other and seemed loath To talk to others. Last of all, Miss Ridley would have gone to wall Had it not been for Kit, who was The innocent but active cause Of Phil's ineffable disgust, For he had meant to have discussed Matters for Kit's own private ear, Which she was anxious not to hear, And, seeing that the governess Was all alone, began to express Her pity and invited her To come and sit down where they were, Contriving that the talk should be On subjects to include all three. Kit really had a gracious heart And liked to act a friendly part: But there was truly to confess One unto whom her kindliness Would have been much more grateful than The governess—the gentleman Who sat on her right hand and gazed Upon her face till well nigh dazed. Hall, the Professor, Will and Lil Had ridden. Kit so dreaded Phil That she had given up her horse To Hall, and driven to the course Lest any accident should force The fatal tete-à-tete. Phil drove, He was so visibly in love That when he said he wished to drive (Which was when he'd heard Kit arrive At her decision), Will gave up And rode. For neither cared to stoop To th' other's driving which they thought Uninteresting if not fraught With ignominy positive, Having for years been wont to live Like independent potentates Of equal, jealous, neighbouring states. Kit would not ride upon the box And play the goose beside the fox For reasons obvious, and Maud, For reasons just as plain and broad, Could not, in justice to her pride, Take a position by his side, And Madge knew by experience How Phil could illustrate his sense Of being victimised, too well To think the post desirable, And Phil could hardly interfere With Ida, whom the ex-minister Made in a kind of way his own, Although he gladly would have done, For, failing Kit, he liked to be With Ida, who dressed daintily, And had the manners of the class With whom he wished his days to pass. He was not of a kind to press Attentions on the governess, And so he found himself left with His pet aversion—Lachlan Smith. To Phil's more educated eye The barrister's gentility Was shoddy and suggestive of A “Monster Outfitting Alcove,” With his frock-coat not fitting well, And hat the converse of a bell, And long shirt cuffs and large breast pin, And collar forcing up his chin. And his pretentious arguings On races, stock and other things, Of which he was quite ignorant, With people who were conversant Were calculated to confirm And not remove suspicion's germ. But Lachlan Smith talked glibly on These topics dangerous upon, The whole way there and whole way back Without suspecting any lack Of cordial responsiveness, Although if he had chattered less And pondered more he must have seen Phil's ill-disguised contempt and spleen, And was so well pleased in his mind With his success that he inclined To be almost familiar, And might have gone a step too far Had they not fortunately come, Just as they verged upon it, home. That being the last night of all, Even the unæsthetic Hall Sat down to listen to the tale. Madge was named Queen without avail, Insisting that her governess Was fitter, though when they did press Miss Ridley she could testify No more originality Than timidly to give once more The subject of the night before—Love. THE SEVEN FAIRIES. I dreamed a dream of a lady fair, A dream of a lady's birth. There were six fairies assembled there From the East and West and North, All bidden to honour the christening In hope of a fairy gift, But when they answered the fair bidding There was yet one fairy left. Oh! she lives down in the South, they said, Oh, she lives down in the South, Her face is fair and her cheeks are red, But she hath a cruel mouth. Oh! she lives down in the South, they said, In the halls of ice and snow, And a breath of her chilling home is shed Wherever her footsteps go. Two fairies came from the golden East, And wealth and affection brought, They came from where jewels the costliest Of Golconda's gems are wrought, From where the sorrowing wife is fain To share the funeral throne With her dead lord rather than remain In the lonely world alone. And two there came from the western lands, With brightness of sunny France, And Tuscan genius in their hands, With its tinge of wild romance. And there were two from the sturdy North, And their gifts were homely sense And glowing health, with generous mirth And freedom from false pretence. And lastly came Envy from the South, To offer her offerings, With her fair cheeks and her cruel mouth, And a chill draught from her wings. But her cruel mouth was wreathed in smiles, And soothly “I come,” she said, “From the frozen bounds of Antarctic isles My gift unbidden to add. “You gave her love and you gave her wealth And brightness and genius, You gave her wisdom and gave her health, I give her the glorious, “The peerless crown of beauty to wear Her lifelong upon her brow, And ever in her right hand to bear The grace to which all men bow.” And then she opened her draughty wings And fled to the realm of ice, Leaving the child with her offerings Of rich and dainty device. And there rose a hum of glad relief That Envy had come and gone Without a word of anger or grief For being the unasked one. And a glow of transport through them thrilled At Envy's glorious gift, For Envy was vengeful when ill-willed, And Envy's revenge was swift. But amid the glow there came a chill, And amid the hum a moan, And her cold wings seemed to wave there still Though she to her home had flown. And e'en the good fays fell murmuring That Envy had outgraced all In the gift she brought without summoning To the christening festival. II. The years fled onwards within my dream, And with them Desirée grew Into a form that might well beseem The Fairy queen of the dew, Loving and sensible, healthy, bright, With clear intelligent eye Reflecting the intellect's inward light, Reared in all the luxury Which wealth could pay for and art supply, And with every wish fulfilled, That kindly forethought could satisfy, Almost as soon as 'twas willed. But even the mates of her childish hours Had always begrudged her less Her wealth and health and mind's rare powers, Her wisdom and happiness, Than the crown of beauty that Envy set Upon her brow as a gift, Which seemed in sooth as though it had yet Some taint of the giver left. III. The years flew onwards within my dream, Once more Desirée I saw, A woman such as might well beseem Apelles' pencil to draw; Bright as the morning, glowing with health, Warm-hearted tho' worldly wise, With each allurement added that wealth And art and love could devise, With a face as beautiful as the day, And a body fairy light, And upon her a winning grace alway That conquered man's love at sight, With genius stamped upon the brow And speaking out from her eye, A queen of love to whom all should bow In homage reverently. IV. One day, but no longer in my dream, Came there one his suit to plead, Wealthy and held in high esteem, Of an ancient house the head. He cared not for wealth, for his own was great, He cared not for happy ways, He cared not for wisdom, nor sought a mate For the love which sweetens days. He loved not the light of genius, Or the glowing cheek of health, And her spirit high and generous He valued no more than wealth. But her peerless beauty grew on him, And he hated each arm that stole In dance or jest round her body slim From the depths of his grim soul. And when he asked her to be his wife, And spoke of his wealth and state, And the gorgeous trappings of his life, And his halls of ancient date, Her mother was dazzled and bade her yield, As many a mother before Has betrayed a child who on foughten field Would have held her own in war. She yielded. Envy triumphed again With her insidious gift, And on the marriage followed amain With feet relentless and swift. And when any glance or word addressed To his graceful, gifted wife, A blast of envy would pierce his breast Like the cutting of a knife. But he was not the husband for her, With her ready sympathy And fanciful active character And warmth of heart and eye. For she could not but see, with her clear sense, How base and poor was the clay To which she had vowed obedience Upon her marriage day, And she could not dissemble her delight When men, with the power of brain And pride of life that were hers by right, To linger by her were fain. And she so hungered for sympathy And appreciative praise, That perhaps there was too much light in her eye, And too much warmth in her ways, When she heard what she to hear was fain From one whose body and mind Seemed by nature for the praise of men And love of women designed. V. At last to her husband's Hall by chance Came a poet and wanderer, Rich with the learning of old Romance, And a sailer round our sphere. He spoke of the balmy western isles Stretched off the Morocco coast, And the wondrous glacier-scooped defiles That are aye the Switzer's boast. He spoke of the forests of Brazil, And of Canadian woods When autumn tints are on plain and hill, And of mighty falls and floods. He spoke of spice archipelagos And palm-clustered coral reefs, Round which the smiling Pacific flows, And stupendous Austral cliffs, Of the feudal castles of Norman France. The cities of Languedoc, Of the Vega's green luxuriance, And Granada's haunted rock, Of the fallen monuments of pride Set up by the Romans' hand, Of the grand old town at Arno's side, And the burgs of Vaterland, Of the deathless marbles of antique Greece, And the Tajs of Hindustan, And Egypt's monolith masterpiece, And stone-marvels Mexican, And the gracefullest women of earth, The daughters of proud Castile, Queen slaves of Circassian birth, And Greeks with the old profile. And he whispered that none were so fair As she with the grace we so prize, With the wave of her glittering hair, And the gleam of her glorious eyes. He told her legends of old Romance In fable and history, Of Mary Queen of Scotland and France, And Frances of Rimini, Of Guinevere, Grissel and Elaine, And the Ysoldes fair and dark, Sir Tristram's gentle wife-chatelaine, And his love, the wife of Marc, Of Dido the Carthaginian, Who for her passion died, And of the mighty Athenian And his Ionian bride, Of Frithjof and Ingebjorg the queen, Of Brynhild and sad Gudrun, And Sigurd and the last battle scene In the palace of the Hun, Of Henry and fair frail Rosamond, And fair chaste Eleanor Who sucked the venom from Edward's wound, Though she should die therefore. And he whispered that none were so fair As she with the grace we so prize, With the wave of her glittering hair, And the gleam of her glorious eyes. He was goodly enough for her love, Had brain enough for her brain, And it seemed as if Heaven above Had meant them for one, not twain. And with hearts they joined but not with hands, Although his indeed were free, For hers were linked in the fetter-bands Of a marriage slavery. Yet Envy seemed to sleep for a while, As if to entice them on With a subtle cruelty and guile For a deeper fall anon. And her lord so jealous heretofore Seemed to doze in apathy, While she was carried out more and more On to the enchanted sea Of love for an object worthy of love, Of love that would elevate, If Fancy only were free to rove In her original state. And Envy slept until they should come Into their fool's paradise Of the intercourse which lights a home With pure and rational joys. And then she awoke and struck her dart So deeply into the side Of the jealous husband, that his heart Was choked with the surging tide Of passion and hatred, which did start, And without one word he died. VI. Alas for Desirée, wooed and won By the husband now of her choice, For Envy's spite still made her its own, And held her as in a vice. For her tyrant's swift mysterious death And her speedy union Aroused Report's calumnious breath, And estranged friends one by one. Alas for Desirée, though she had wealth And brightness and genius, And mellow wisdom and glowing health, Though she had the glorious, The peerless crown of beauty to wear Her lifelong upon her brow, And ever in her right hand to bear The grace to which all men bow, Though she had the husband whom she chose, Though her hands at length were free From the fetter-bands so cruelly close Of her marriage slavery, She could not live in the land of her love, The land of her broad estates, But ever away from home must rove Impelled by pitiless fates. And so they came to a far-off isle On the lone Pacific's breast, And here they live in repose awhile, Even Envy letting them rest. And here this beautiful English dame And brilliant Englishman, With their broad estates and ancient name Unsullied by real stain, Live in soft exile, and never see The face of their countrymen, Save when a schooner from Sydney quay Sails down with their stores, and then Only some mariner rough and free Who finds them beyond his ken— This delicate dame in soft attire, With wondrous beauty of face, And white wise forehead and glance of fire, And unforgettable grace, This lordly man of wealth without bound, And rich in knowledge and worth, Thus living as one might say beyond The uttermost end of earth. Adieu, Desirée, living thus far, A kind of enchanted queen To mariners when they cross the bar Of your harbour coraline! Mayhap it may prove a magic isle Where Envy shall not prevail To banish your pleasure with her guile And peace with her icy gale. Those whom the powers would have destroyed They make of understanding void. Phil, when at length the tale was o'er, Proposed to have a dance once more, And Kit, well pleased with her success Of last night, was in readiness To dance again, because she thought This course with less of danger fraught, And one who danced so perfectly Needs must enjoy Phil's mastery Of step and poise: and so she danced Dance after dance, herself entranced With his facility, and he With her new affability. Not only did she thus deceive Herself, but made them all believe That she relented. She was fair Enough to make a man despair, And rosy-cheeked with golden curl Cut short, not so much like a girl As like a lovely, glowing boy Ere manhood hastens to destroy The silky smoothness of his face, Only that they have scant of grace And she so much. In height she stood Above the mean of womanhood, But not unduly. She was slim, As Australs are, of waist, and limb At wrist and ankle, but more full Up higher. Lithe and powerful As health and constant exercise Could make her, with her clear grey eyes, Symbolic of her proud, brave soul, A woman taken as a whole, In her sole self embodying All which makes man creation's king, And woman its chief ornament. No wonder then that all eyes bent On her as she waltzed lightly by With glowing cheek and sparkling eye And ruffled curls, surrendering Her motions to Phil's piloting Without remonstrance, and thereby Filling the grand deficiency Which left her beauty incomplete, That which makes maidenhood as sweet As a moss-rose or violet, Or the green grass of spring, ere yet It feels the cruel searing stress Of summer—maiden gentleness. It is not easy to maintain An attitude of cold disdain When one is heated with a dance, And Kit relaxed her vigilance So far as to be cordial To Phil's oft ineffectual But still repeated courtesies, So much so that he deemed his prize Within his grasp, and suddenly Waltzing her almost forcibly Into the open boudoir, closed The door behind him—and proposed. Kit was so thunderstruck that he Had kissed her twice triumphantly Ere she gave her indignant ‘no,’ And then fierce tears began to flow At the humiliating state In which she found herself—irate First with herself for being caught In her own trap, then with Phil Forte For having dared to offer her Such ignominy, angrier When she reflected how her mien Must have encouraged him that e'en, Yet did not hurry to the door Now that the worst of it was o'er, But stayed a little while to vent Her anger and astonishment, And to compose her countenance Before she went back to the dance. “How dare you, Phil?” she said at length, When her mind had regained its strength, “How dare you?” but then, seeing how He was prostrated by the blow, Her good heart triumphed and she said, Lifting her gallant, graceful head To look at him with firm, pained eyes, “Phil, was it right or kind or wise To take advantage of me thus? I thought you were more generous, Than to abuse my confidence, Knowing, as you well do, the sense Of loathing for the marriage-bond I entertain. Were you as fond Of me as you pretend you are, You'd banish all such thoughts afar And treat me as a brother, Phil, In fact just like your brother Will.” “You like him better. I have seen Him kissing you—you...” “Why,” we've been Neighbours and friends this twenty years, And I'd do more than box his ears Unless I knew that it was done Merely to tease me—just his fun. No, Phil. I do not love him more But like him better, as before You persecuted, I liked you, And as I still should like you too If you were fond enough of me Not to tease me so cruelly.” “Cruelly, Kit? It's not unkind To love with one's whole heart and mind.” “Love? what is there in me to love?” “To love in you, who are above All women in all graces which The lot of womanhood enrich.” “There's hardly any girl you meet Who's not more graceful and more sweet.” “O Kit, you cannot be so dull As not to know how beautiful, How graceful, how superb, how far Above the common herd you are.” “Phil, this is flattery, don't try Me with mere compliments to buy.” “Kit,” he said so reproachfully, That she went up with softened eye, And putting her two hands in his, Said, “Well then, Phil, give me a kiss, And promise never to refer To this unpleasant rencontre, And not to speak to me again Of marriage. Then we can remain Friends as before. I will not be An atom different, and we Can easily keep out of sight All that has happened here to-night, Otherwise I must go away To-morrow early in the day.” He did not take the proffered kiss, But shook his head. “I can't do this: I can but love you all my life, And pray you to become my wife Whenever chance lets me intrude Upon you in a generous mood.” “Well then, good-bye, Phil! take me back, I'll say that I feel an attack Of headache coming over me And bid them good-night hurriedly. Kit went to bed, and Phil went out To walk with rapid stride about, In hopes of working off his load Of disappointed love, and strode Till long past midnight. The next day Kit packed her ‘traps’ and drove away Back to her father's place, which lay Some twenty miles off. Phil went up, Meaning, for the first time, to stop Some months upon his Queensland run. Chesterfield took Maud Morrison And Ida Lewis back to town, Hall, Phil Forte's partner, just stayed down To do some station-business, Which Phil, who posted off express, Left pending. Lachlan Smith ere long Went, for assize-work, to Geelong. Two months were left ere term began, And one of them like lightning ran In wandering about with Lil, And sometimes driving out with Will All over pleasant Waratah And stations that were not too far. Then the Professor had to leave To make his home fit to receive Its pretty mistress (for the day Was fixed, long ere he went away, To be some three weeks' space before The long vacation time was o'er). And Lil, the day that he went back, Went to their own house in Toorak With Mrs Forte, to help to choose The furniture she was to use, Her father's wedding gift. He gave Carte blanche to both of them to have Whatever they thought requisite To deck their house or furnish it. Three weeks thus busy quickly passed, Then Lil went back to spend her last At home, while the Professor stayed, And final preparations made For their reception. For they meant (And persevered in their intent) To have their honeymoon at home In their own house, and not to roam In boarding-houses and hotels As they saw everybody else, Affording people food for jest Or food for pity at the best. How much more sensible it is In ordinary marriages Where the bridegroom has not too much Of time or money in his clutch, To spend the little that he has In adding those etceteras Which go to make a little house Dainty if not luxurious. Much honeymoonshine in home life Is not the lot of every wife, And so the golden month should be Economised most carefully In gilding every room and nook, A flower-bed here, and there a book, With one of the small sorceries So magical in lovers' eyes. Ah, pitiful! there's many a home To which no love-making has come, Passion's brief transport being spent Ere they into its portals went, The man a business-machine, The woman not her husband's queen But his housekeeper—and here judge If I speak truth or not—his drudge. Newly-wed lovers should not roam, But stay to beautify their home With blossoms of the honeymoon, So hard to mimic when it's gone. The weary reader will not care To go to the upholsterer With Lil to see how the refined And graceful tenour of her mind Declared itself in ottomans, Or took an airy flight in fans, But be content to leave her here In the enchanted atmosphere Of trysting days,—a maiden fair Without the shadow of a care To keep back from her passion-flower The full spring-sunshine of its hour. Finished at Springwood, Blue Mountains, New South Wales. 1.7 A.M., September 17th, 1883. UPON THE S.S. “BALLAARAT,” A P. and O. Steamer. Off Ushant, May 25th, 1884. (Dedicated to the Hon. J. B. Watt of Sydney.) O stately ship, fast-speeding to thy port, Our home for six bright weeks of sunny weather, We have had many pleasant hours together Since we embarked—voyagers of either sort, Old colonists returning to the land They left long since to win an independence, And young folks, born Australians, in attendance, Longing to see their Father's native strand. We shall not leave our ship without a sigh. In which were born so many loves, hopes, fears, And friendships sure to last for many years, Or the blithe officers who brought us by Australia, Asia, Africa, to rest Safe in our dear old island of the West.</field>
