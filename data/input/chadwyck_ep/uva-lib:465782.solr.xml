      <field name="fulltext">The pagination of the source document has been followed. Upon the Authours Piece of Anniquity, by his Friend. New Pamphlets every day, new Book's the cry: The reason (since they are so common) why? Can that be new whose likeness every day Appears in the same mode? for shame away. If this be news, then Pie at Christmas is, And Pancakes on Shrove-Tuseday are novelties: But here's a Piece; come quick, before 'tis sold. 'Tis truly new: for why? because 'tis old. Chaucer's Ghoast OR, A Piece of Antiquity. [Pygmalion niveum mira feliciter arte] Argument I. How Pygmalion fell in Love with the Image he made. Pygmalion niveum mira feliciter arte Sculp sit ebur, formamq; dedit, qua fæmina nasci Nulla potest, operesq; sui concepit amorem. Ovid. l. x. I find that heretofore was one, whose name it was Pygmalion, which was a lusty man of youth, and at fine warks was very couth above all other men, as tho, and through fortune it fell him so. As he that doth in Love travail, he made an Image of entail; like to a Woman in semblance of feature and of countenance. So fair, yet never was Figure, right as a living creature she seemed, for of Ivory white he hath it wrote of such delight. She was ruddy on the Cheke, and red on her Lips eke, whereof then he himself begyl'd, for with a goodly look she smil'd; so that through pure impression of his own imagination, with all the heat of his courage his love upon this fair Image he set: and her of love pray'd, but she not one word again said. All the long day what thing he did, this fair Image in the same stead was ever by, so that at meat he would her serve, and pray'd her eat, and put unto her mouth the cup: and when the board was taken up, he led her to his chamber home, and after when the night was come, he lay'd her in bed all naked, he often wept and often waked. He kist her cold lips oft and oft, and wisht her that they were more soft; and oft he told her in her ear, and oft his arm now here now there he lay'd as he would her embrace; and ever and anon he asked grace, as though she wyst what it meant, and himself began to torment. But Venus of her grace him heard by night, and whan that least he fear'd, and it lay naked in his arm, the cold Image began be warm of flesh and bone, and full of life; lo thus he wan a lusty Wife, which obeysant was at his will, and of his pleasure gave him fill. But if he would have help him still, he should have failed of his will; but 'cause he pray'd, his love he sped, and had all that he would abed; for e're away they two did go, a jolly child between them two they gate: Thus Love is favourable to them that have been of Love stable. [?alienæ cornua fronti] Argument II. How Diana turned Acteon into a Hart, and how he was devoured by his own Dogs. ?alienæ cornua fronti Addita, vosq; canes satiati sanguine herili. Ovid. l. 3. Ovid in his book he spakes examples touchen bad mistakes, and saith, how whilome there was one a worthy Lord, which Acteon was call'd, and he was Cousin nigh to him that Thebes first on high up set. Acteon 'bove all chear had used it from year to year, with Hounds and with great Horns amongst the Woods and the Thorns, to make his Hunting and his Chace, where he best thought in every place, to find out Game in a fair way, there rode he for to hunt and play. So him befell upon a tide, on his hunting as he did ride, in a Forest alone he was, and saw there upon the green grass the fair flowers fresh to spring, he heard amongst the leafs to sing the Throstel with the Nightingale. Thus (e're he wyst) into a Dale he came, and in a Plain he lit all round about which was beset with bushes green, and cedars high, and there within he cast his eye; amidst the Plain he saw a Well so fair, that there may no man tell. In which Diana naked stood to bathe and play her in the Floud, with many Nymphs which there her served: but he his eye away ne're swerved from her that was naked and tall; but she was wondrous wrath withall, and him (as she which was Goddess) for's hope, anon gave him likeness of Beasts, and made him be a Hart, which was before his Dogs to start. Then ran he busily about with many a horn, and many a rout, that made moche noise and piteous cry; and at the last unhappily this Hart his own Hounds grimly slew, and to pieces mischievously him drew. Lo now my Son, what it is a man to cast his eye amiss. [?Placuit, quæ sit sententia docti] Arg. III. How Jupiter and Juno fell at odds concerning Love, and how they chose Tiresias for their Judge, &amp;c. ?Placuit, quæ sit sententia docti Quærere Tiresiæ. Venus huic erat utraq; utraq; nota.? Ovid. l. 3. Truth 'tis that good ne're came of strife, to seek it in all a mans life, though it begin upon pure game, full oft it turneth into bane, and doth grievance on some side, whereof the great Clerk Ovide, after this manner, as I trow, of Jupiter and's Wife Juno, makes in his books mention how they fell at dissention amongst themselves in unity, and that was upon this degree; which of the two more amorous is, or man or wife; and upon this they might no ways accord in one, and took one to judge thereupon, which called is Tyresias, and bid him deem just in this case; and he without any avisement against Juno gave his judgment. This Goddess upon his answer was wroth, and would not forbear, but took away for evermo the light from both his eyes two. When Jupiter this hurt had seen, another benefit then agen he gave, and such a grace him doth, that what he wist he said soth, a Sothsayer he was for ever; but yet that other had lever have had the looking of his eye, then of his word the Prophecy. [Pulshrior in tota, quam Larissæa Coronis] Arg. IV. Of the Love of Apollo toward Coronis; and how the white Bird for discovering it was turned into a black Raven. Pulshrior in tota, quam Larissæa Coronis, Non fuit Amonia; placuit tibi Delphia certè, Dum vel casta fuit vel inobservata: sed ales Sensit adulterium Phœbius, &amp;c. Ovid. l. 2. Now take a Tale into thy mind, the which of old ensample I find. Phœbus, which maketh the days light, a Love he had a handsome Wite Coronis, whom aboven all he pleased, but what shall befall of Love, there is no man knoweth; but as Fortune her happes throweth. So it befell upon a chance, a young Knight took her acquaintance, and had of her all that he wold, but a false Bird that was too bold; though kept in Chamber from pure youth, discovered all that e're he couth: the Bird's name was amongst men Corvus; and the Bird was then well more white than any Swan: and he did tell all that he can, and all her thefts to Phœbus said. But he for wrath his Swerd out-braid, and it to Coronis did show, but after that there was much wo; and she took full great repentance, whereof in token and remembrance of him which used wicked speech, upon this Bird he took his wrech, that he which was snow-white before, was afterwards cole-black therefore transformed; thus his deeds he sheweth, and many a man yet him beshreweth; and calleth him unto this day a Raven, by whom yet men say take evidence when that he crieth, that some mishap it signifieth. [Nec si quæsieris odium Cyclopis amorne] Arg. V. How the Giant Polyphemus loved the Nymph Galatea. Nec si quæsieris odium Cyclopis amorne Acidis in nobis fucrit præstantior edam. Ovid. l. xiij. Great Polyphemus long since thought, when that he Galate had besought of Love, which he might not latch that made him for to wait and watch by all ways how she far'd, till at last he knew and heard, how that another had leave to love the Nymph, which did him grieve; so that he knaw none other rede, as for to speak of any speed, but for to watch and wait on all, till he may see the chance befall, that he her Love might grieve, which he himself might not achieve. This Galatea, saith the Poet, above all others was most meet of beauty, which then all men knew, and had a lusty Love and true, a Batchelour in high degree, right such another as was she, on which her heart was so fast set, so that it might by naught be let. This Knight Acis was very hot, and she againward also hot him loved onely, and no mo; hereof was Polyphemus wo. Through pure envy and ever spy'd, and waited upon every side, when he togyder might them see, this young Acis with Galate. So long he waited to and fro, till at the last he found them two in privy place whereas they stood to speak, and have her words made good: The place wherein he them did spie, it was under a bank, nigh the great Sea, and he above stood and beheld the lusty Love which each of them to other made with goodly cheer, and words full glade. So all his heart was set on fire by pure envy and deadly ire; and then he flew away, I trow, as arrow flyeth out of bow; as though he were for Love start mad, when as he saw this sight so sad. This Polypheme a Geaunt was, and when he saw the soth o'th' cas how Galate him did forsake, and Acis to her Love did take; his heart no longer might forbear, but he roar'd out like any bear, and ran Ætna the hill about, where never yet the fire was out, full fill'd with sorrow and disease, 'cause he saw Acis weil at ease; till at the last he him bethought, as he which all by envy sought, and turned to the bank again; where he with Galate had seen young Acis, whom he thought to grieve, though he himself might not relieve. This Geaunt then with his rude might part of the banck did throw out-right; the which fell just on Acis pate, and knockt him down (for 'twas his fate) Thus Polypheme did Acis slay, but Galate did run away; and as she fled along the Land, Neptune took her by the hand, and kept her in so fast a place from Polypheme and his menace; that he for all his false envy might ne're enjoy her company. [Accipe me generum dixi Parthaone nate] Arg. VI. The Battaile between Hercules and Achelous for the Love of Deianira. Accipe me generum dixi Parthaone nate, Dixit &amp; Alcides, &amp;c.? Ovid. l. ix. Oeneus had Calydons Empire, and had a Daughter Deianyre, and all men wyst that there was none so fair a Wight as she was one; and as she was a lusty Wight, right so was then a noble Knight, to whom Mercury fader was, which set up two pillars of brass, the which as yet a man may find, set up in the Desert of Inde; this was the worthy Hercules, whose name shall be endless for all the marvails that he wrought. This Hercules the Love besought of Deianire, and of this thing unto her fader which was King he spake, touching of Marriage. The King knowing his high linage, and dreadding all his deeds mighty, ne're durst his Daughter to deny. Yet netheless this he him said, how Achilous, e're he, first pray'd to wed her: and in that accord they stood as it were on record: but for all that this he him granted, that which of them the other daunted in arms, his Daughter him should take, and do what she would for his sake. This Achelous was a Gyant, a subtle man and a deceyvant; who through Magick and Sorcery could all the world out-treachery. And whan that he this Tale heard upon what score the King answer'd to Hercules, that he must fight, he trusted much upon his slight: And Love that every heart doth stear, made him his life not to forbear; for his Lady whom he desir'd, but with courage his heart it fir'd: And so he sent word without fail, that he would enter the Battaile. At the set day and chosen field, the Knights both covered under shield, togyder came at the time set, and each one is with other met. It fell that they fought both on foot, there was no stone, there was no root which might let them in their way, but all was void and ta'ne away. Truth, they smite strokes but very few, for Hercules who then would shew his great strength, as for the nonce he starts upon him all at once, and caught him in his arms so strong: the Gyant wote he could not long endure under so hard a bond; then by some slight for to escape, as he himself could best mishape, in likeness of a snake he skipt out of his hand, and forth he leapt; and oft as he that fight woul, he turn'd himself into a Bull, and 'gan to bellow in such a sound, as though the skies would fall to ground. The earth he spurns, and then he pranceth, and his broad Horns he then advanceth, and cast them here and there about. But he who made of him no doubt, awaited well, and when he came by both his Horns he did him tame, and all at once he did him cast unto the ground, and held him fast, that he ne're might by any slight out of his hands get up on height, till he was overcome, and told that Hercules might what he would. The King then granted to fulfill his askings 'cording to his will; and he that had with danger served, did think he had her well deserved: and thus with great desert of Arms, he wan her for to ligge in arms, as he which had it dearly bought, and otherwise he should not. [Ut Venere locum conjux &amp; adulter in unum] Arg. VII. Mars and Venus caught together, and chained by Vulcan. Ut Venere locum conjux &amp; adulter in unum, Arte viri, vinclisq; nova ratione paratis, In mediss ambo deprensi amplexibus hærent. Ovid. l. iv. Upon a certain case of Love amongst the gods that dwell above, upon a time it fell out thus. The god of fire which Vulcanus is hot, and hath a craft forthwith assigned for to be a Smith to Jupiter, to forge his Thunder, at which all mortal men do wonder. This Vulcanus in the figure both of visage and of stature, is loathly and malgracious, but yet he hath within his house, as for the liking of his life, the fair Venus to be his Wife. But Mars that of all Battails is the god, an eye had unto this; and he which was so chivalrous, it fell him to be amorous; and thought it was great pity to see so fair a one as she be coupled with so foul a Wight: and she that had so good insight toward so noble a Knightly Lord, fell in Love with his accord. There lacked nought but time &amp; place for him for to enjoy her Grace. But when two hearts fall into one, so wise a wait was never none; but at some time they two will meet: and thus this Lady fair and sweet with Mars had often company; till at last unkind jealousie, which evermore the heart opposeth, maketh Vulcan that he supposeth, that it is not well over all, and to himself he said, he shall espie better, if that he may; and so it fell upon a day, that he this thing so slightly led, that he did find them both a bed, all warm each one with other naked, and he with craft had ready maked strong chains, and therewithall them bound, as he togyder had them found; and then he left them lying so, and 'gan to call and cry, ho, ho, unto the gods that lived about, and they assembled in a rout; and came the matter for to see, but none amend at all had he, but was rebuked here and there of all that Venus Lovers were. Who said that he was for to blame, if there befell him any shame, it was through his misgovernance, and thus he lost his countenance. Then they them loosed from the bands, whereof these earthly hunbands for ever may ensample take, I such a chance them overtake. [Conjugis adventum præsenserat, inq; nitentem] Arg. VIII. How Jupiter ravished Io; and how she was transformed into a Cow, and how Mercury slew her Keeper Argus. Conjugis adventum præsenserat, inq; nitentem Inachidos vultus mutaverat ille juvencam. Ovid. l. i. Ovid telleth in his Saws, how Jupiter in ancient days lay by a Maid, which Io was called, whereof's Wife Juno was wroth; and as she was Goddess, of Io turned the likeness into a Cow, to go throughout the fields and pastures thereabout, and get her meat upon the Green; and thereupon the lofty Queen betook her Argus for to keep; for he was seldom wont to sleep, because he had an hundred eyes, all were alive, and all were spies. Now hearken how he was beguiled by Mercury, who was affiled this Cow to steal; he came disguised, and had a Pipe full well devised of Musick, and thus to the field he came, where Argus he beheld with Io, which beside him went. With that anon his Pipe he bent, and 'gan to pipe in such manner, things which were sleepy for to hear; and in his piping ever among he sang him such a lulling Song, that he the Giant brought asleep, and there was no eye that might keep his head, which Mercury off smote, and so away the Cow he got; the Cow, I say, which Argus kept, and all this fell for that he slept. [Victa nitore dei positâ vim passa querela est. ] Arg. IX. Leucothea ravished by Phœbus. Victa nitore dei positâ vim passa querela est. Ovid. l. iv. Venus which hath the Law in hand, of that which we cannot withstand, as she who doth the treasure guard of Love, and hath it in her ward; Phœbus to Love hath so constrained, that without rest he's sorely pained, with all his watchfulness to wait to find the Damsels guards less strait, who was in chamber kept so close, that she ne're did her self disclose, but with her mother for to play, Leucothea (so as men say) this Maid was fair, and Orchamus her Fader was; but it fell thus to's Daughter, that was kept so dear, and had been so from year to year, under her Mothers Discipline a clean Maid and a fair Virgin: Upon the whose Nativity of comeliness and of beauty, Nature had set all that she may; that like unto the Moneth of May, which all the other Moneths o'th' year surmounteth: So without her peer, was of this Maiden the feature; whereof Phœbus without measure her loved, and on every side awaited, if so may betide, that he through any slight might her lusty Maidenhead unright, esteem'd above all the worlds wealth. And thus lurking upon stealth, in his await so long he lay; till it befell upon a day, that he throughout the Chamber wall came in all suddenly, and stall that thing that was to him so chief, But wo the while he was a thief. And Venus who was Enemy of such Love-treachery, discovered all the plain case to Clymene, who then was towards Phœbus his Concubine; and whan she found the cause in fine of all the case, then she was wroth, and for to plague the Maid she goeth, and told her Father how it stood, who was for sorrow well nigh wood. And to her Mother thus he said, Lo what it is to keep a Maid. To Phœbus dare I nothing speak, but unto her it shall be wreke. So that all Maidens after this now take ensample, what it is to suffer Maidenhead be lost, for fear it should their death them cost, and bad with that to make a pit, wherein he hath his Daughter set, as he that would no pity have, so that she was all quick in Grave, and died anon in his presence. But Phœbus who had reverence to her that died for his Love, hath wrought through his power above, that she spring up out of the mold, into a flower as bright as Gold. [Dum redit itq; frequens in virgine Nona. crinâ.] Arg. X. Calisto deflowred by Jupiter. Dum redit itq; frequens in virgine Nona. crinâ. Hæsit, &amp;c. Ovid. l. ii. King Cytheron upon his Wife a Daughter had, a goodly life, and clean Maiden of goodly fame, and Calisto was her right name called, and she by many a Lord was oft besought, but her accord to Love might no man win, as she which had no lust therein; but swore within her heart, and said, she would for ever be a Maid. Wherefore to keep her self in peace with the Nymphs Amadriades, upon the Springs and the fresh VVells, she hopes to dwell, and no where ells: and thus came this Calistona into the Wood of Tegea, and thus she came within the sight of Diana, and there she plight her troth upon the VVoods so green, to preserve her Maidenhead clean, which afterwards upon a day was privily stolen away. For Jupiter through his quaintise from her it took in such a wise, that suddenly, and forth withall her womb arose, and she did swall; so then she could no longer hide, and thereupon it did betide, that Diana (the soth to tell) in privy place unto a VVell, with Nymphs all in her company was gone, and out of waggery she said, that she bathe would, and bad that every Maiden should with her all naked bathe also, and then began the privy wo. And Calisto was red for shame; but they that never knew the game, to whom no such thing did befall, anon they made them naked all, because that nothing they would hide; but she withdrew her ever aside; and netheless into the Floud, whereas Diana her self stood, she thought for to come unperceived, but thereof she was all deceived; for when she came a little nigh, and Diana her VVomb did spie, she said, away O thou foul Beast, for thy estate is not honest; nor may'st thou this chaste water touch, for thou hast ta'ne a touch too much, which never may be whole again. And thus she goes which was forlain with shame, and fled away that day from all the Nymphs, for ever and ay. [My son a man to buy him peace] Arg. XI. Of the great patience of the Philosopher Socrates, and how his Wife threw a pot full of water upon his head. My son a man to buy him peace, behoves to suffer as Socrates; for amongst men 'tis evident, that he was very patient; for he wedded a wicked Wife, who gave him much sorrow and strife: against his ease it was contraire, but he spake ever soft and fair; till it befell, (as it is told) in Winter when the day is cold, that his wife was from the Well come, with a full pot of water home: and so she brought it in the house, and saw how that her quiet spouse was set, and looked on a Book nigh to the fire, as he who took his ease, as for a man of age; but she began her wonted rage, and asked him what divel he thought, that he so near the fire him brought: when as she labour took in hand, and said that such an Husband was to a Wife not worth a stre, but he said neither nay nor ye; but held him still, and let her chide. But she which may her self not hide, began within forthwith to swell, and that she brought in from the VVell, the water-pot she put aloft, and bade him speak; but he all soft sate still, and not a word answer'd, with that she ask'd him how he far'd; and asked him if he be dead? and all the water on his head she poured out, and bade him wake. But he which never would forsake his patience, did softly spake, that he ne wondred what was done, for now the winter was begun, and winter as by way of kind, which stormy is, as men it find, first maketh the winds for to blow, and after that within a throw it rains, which reason's well beseen, to cause me novv both vvind and rain after the season of the year; and then he set him near the fire. The Pleasant History of Prince Corniger, and his Champion Sir Crucifrag. Arg. XII. Of the excellent Harper Arion. O would to God that now were one, another such as Arion, who had a harp of such tempture, and thereto of so good measure he sung, that he the beasts wild made of his note tame and mild. The Hind in peace with the Lion, the Wolf in peace with the Mutton, the Hart in peace stood with the Hound; and every man on the same ground which at that time this Harper heard, as well the Lord as the Shepherd. He brought them all in good accord, so that the Common with the Lord, and Lords with the Common also, he set in amity both two, and put away melancholly; that was a lusty melody, when ev'ry man did th'other love. And if there were the ground above one which could harp as he did, he might avail in many a stede, to make peace where now is hate, for many men think on debate. And now God wot upon this tide, we see the world on every side in sundry wise so diversed, that it well nigh stands all reversed. So were it good at this tide, that every man on his side besought, and pray'd for the peace, which is the cause of all increase, of worship, and of worlds wealth, of hearts rest, and souls health. Then pray for Peace ye mortal men. Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen. The Authours Friend to the Readers upon his perusal of the Work. Lo here Antiquity, what think you, Sirs, To see a Poem drest in Boots and Spur; A short Cloak, and long Breeches, in the fashion Of those that liv'd before us in this nation: 'Tis pretty (faith) and pleasant for to see How we with Antiquity disagree. And to that purpose here my loving friend His Conjuring-glass unto the World doth lend; Where both his worth appearing we may finde, And Chaucer's Ghoast, or else we all are blinde. FINIS.</field>
