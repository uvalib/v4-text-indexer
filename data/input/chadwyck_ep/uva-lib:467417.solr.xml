      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. MEMOIRS OF M. G. LEWIS. CHAPTER III. Residence in Germany—Goethe—German Princes—Dukes and Excellencies—“The East Indian”—Volume of Poems—Mrs Jordan A Palpable Falsehood. “In your last book, friend Mat, you really tell A lie so gross, that ev'ry one descries it; Your title-page asserts, ‘Sold by John Bell.’ How can you say ‘'tis sold,’ when no one buys it?” CHAPTER IV. Correspondence continued—Visit to Scotland—Contribution To newspapers—Domestic Matters To ?, Esq., On the mention made of the Empress of Russia, in the House of Commons, by Mr. Sheridan, on Thursday, April 25th. Well may the angry Edmund roar “The Age of Chivalry's no more,”— Since Sheridan's detected In railing at that royal Dame, Of warlike and of amorous fame, Till late by Whigs respected. Would none defend the spoiler's cause, And give her lawless deeds applause? Didst thou too, F??, abuse her? Could not thy artful brain produce, To serve thy friend, some lame excuse, And baffle her accuser? How, when this news of strange import Shall reach thy once-loved Russian court, Will anger shake the palace! Inflamed with rage, imperial Kate Shall doom thy bust to high estate, And fix it on a gallows. Oh! were it not thy head of stone, But that black mass of flesh and bone, Which grows between thy shoulders, That, perched on Temple Bar, might fright And yet the gazing mob delight,— What joy for the beholders! I know you long have striv'n to gain A patriot's name, but striv'n in vain; From me then take a favour:— To gain that name I'll teach you how— Go hang yourself! then, we'll allow, A patriot's your behaviour. By throttling, show your public zeal; Your death shall prove your country's weal, And end all strife and wrangling: Parties shall join the deed to praise, And national subscriptions raise A gibbet for thy dangling. Then Englishmen shall say, who view Your patriot legs in air, to you Their gratitude expressing: “Though various crimes his annals blot, Now be those various crimes forgot, His death's so great a blessing!” Thus shall they say: “Then haste to swing To praise, upon the hempen string; And, famed in British story, England shall long retain your name, Your faults and life esteem'd its shame, Your parts and death, its glory.” But, to complete Britannia's feast, Your gibbet must (a patriot beast) Consent to carry double, That, you before, and Dick behind, At once the road to hell may find, And save Jack Ketch the trouble. The Ghost of Col. Titus. CHAPTER V. Residence at the Hague—“Mysteries of Udolpho”—The Dutch— Parties of Madame de Matignon—Dutch assemblies—Anecdote of Lord Keny—“The Monk”—Visit to the army at Arnheim— Bombardment of the bridge of Nimeguen—Duke of York—Character of the French and allied armies—English Sensibility POOR SIMON'S MONODY. You ask what cause my tears supplies; They flow because I'm weeping; Nor e'er shall slumber close my eyes Again, except I'm sleeping. That I poor Simon's death lament, No reason for surprise is; Oh! he had been a perfect saint, If he had had no vices. His courage did he oft display, Where drums and cannon rattle, And never ran from fight away But when he fled from battle. He was to speak the truth inclined, Save when he falsehoods stated; And was a friend to all mankind, Excepting those he hated. Grim death, alack! for Simon's woe, In single combat found him; And Simon would not kill his foe, Because he could not wound him. Then doctors grave this judgment gave,— “Good sir, you may rely on't, That if your wound is mortal found, 'Tis likely you will die on't.” Yet I'm disposed, I must confess, To think the doctors wrong here; The true cause of his death, I guess, Was—he could live no longer. These tears, which all my friends devise, I to his loss am giving; Oh! surely had not Simon died, He would have now been living! INSCRIPTION IN AN HERMITAGE. Whoe'er thou art these lines now reading, Think not, though from the world receding, I joy my lonely days to lead in This desert drear; That, with remorse, a conscience bleeding Hath led me here. No thought of guilt my bosom sours, Free-willed I fled from courtly bowers; For well I saw, in halls and towers, That Lust and Pride, The arch-fiend's darkest, direst powers, In pomp preside. I saw mankind with vice incrusted; I saw that Honour's sword was rusted; That few for aught but folly lusted; That he was still deceived who trusted In love or friend; And hither fled, with man disgusted, My life to end. In this lone cave, in garments lowly, Alike a foe to noisy folly, And sullen brow-bent melancholy, I wear away My time; and in my office holy Consume the day. This rock my shield when storms are blowing, The limpid streamlet yonder flowing Supplying drink, the earth bestowing My simple food; But few enjoy the calm I know in This desert rude. Content and comfort bless me more in This grot, than e'er I felt before in A palace; and, with thoughts still soaring To God on high, Each morn and night, with voice imploring, This prayer I sigh: “Let me, O Lord, from life retire, Unknown each worldly vain desire, Remorseful throb, or wanton fire; And when I die, Let me in this belief expire, To God I fly.” Stranger, if full of youth and riot, As yet no woes have marred thy quiet, Thou haply throw'st a scornful eye at The hermit's prayer; But if thou hast a cause to sigh at Thy guilt or care; If thou hast known false love's vexation, Or hast been exiled from thy nation, Or crimes affright thy contemplation, And make thee pine; Oh! how must thou lament thy station, And envy mine! CHAPTER VII. Reception in Society—Anecdote—Parliament—Retirement—Visits To Inverary Castle—Love—“Crazy Jane”—Wild art—Private Theatricals—“The Bugle”—Unpublished MSS CRAZY JANE. “Stay, fair maid! On every feature, Why are marks of dread imprest? Can a wretched, helpless creature Raise such terrors in your breast? Do my frantic looks alarm you? Trust me, sweet, your fears are vain: Not for kingdoms would I harm you— Shun not then poor Crazy Jane. “Dost thou weep to see my anguish? Mark me, and escape my woe: When men flatter, sigh, and languish, Think them false—I found them so! For I loved, Oh! so sincerely, None will ever love again; Yet the man I prized most dearly Broke the heart of Crazy Jane. “Gladly that young heart received him, Which has never loved but one; He seemed true, and I believed him— He was false, and I undone! Since that hour has reason never Held her empire o'er my brain. Henry fled!—With him, for ever, Fled the wits of Crazy Jane. “Now forlorn and broken-hearted, Still with frenzied thoughts beset, Near the spot where last we parted, Near the spot where first we met, Thus I chant my lovelorn ditty, While I sadly pace the plain; And each passer by, in pity, Cries ‘God help thee, Crazy Jane!’” STANZAS Written, on the eve of parting, to a Friend. From those we love compell'd to part, And haply ne'er again to see, What anguish rends the feeling heart! That anguish now is felt by me. Yet let not these fond, foolish tears My int'rest in your mind decrease; Nor murmur when my ill-timed fears Disturb your happy bosom's peace. Those tears from firm affection flow, Parting from you my mind employs; And while it dwells on future woe, My soul is dead to present joys. The vain complaints which now I pour, My reason warns me to suppress; I feel that I should please you more, If parting with you grieved me less. But, oh! 'tis hard the mind to tune, And hard to hide the bosom's pain; While thinking I must leave you soon, And leave you, ne'er to meet again! Or should we meet—perhaps no place For me your heart may then allow; And I may seek in vain a trace Of what so much delights me now. Then think what bitter thoughts must rend My bosom's swelling guest, to find The much-loved name, but not the friend, The well-known form, but not the mind. In vain you call these false alarms— In vain my heart the promise cheers; Ne'er shall that sacred flame that warms Our kindred hearts be cool'd by years— Your flatt'ring words my bosom touch, But, while the prospect glads my view, To find it false I fear so much, I never dare to think it true! Though sad to part, thy friendship well The pain it now inflicts may cure; Time may each anxious doubt dispel, And prove thy faith sincere and pure. Then how my soul shall love thy truth, While musing on life's mournful page; And that which forms my pain in youth Shall be my purest bliss in age! EPILOGUE TO BARBAROSSA. Till now, all who glow'd with theatrical flame, Love of money inspired, or else love of fame; But none of these motives, 'tis clearer than light, Have produced the dramatic attempt of to-night: No shillings for entrance were dropt at the door, No voices, applauding, bawl “Bravo!” “Encore!” And our ardour for glory it surely must quench, To think that we play to three chairs and a bench. When Selim, the tyrant, presumed to rebuke, All he wish'd was obtaining a smile from the Duke; And when the Queen said the King's cruelty shock'd her, She hoped for some little applause from the Doctor. But our utmost ambition was stretch'd to its tether, If the Duke and the Doctor cried “Bravo!” together. Yet the fame of our mirth confined shall not be To a circle so small as the one I now see: No, I'll tell all the world, in the “Times” and the “Sun,” How much we have dared, and how much we have done; And inform the whole kingdom, by means of the papers, That we've just had an access of tragical vapours. In fancy already I see, with delight, “Inverary Theatricals,” full in my sight: “Barbarossa was lately (they cannot say less) Perform'd at the Duke's with the greatest success; The scenes were well painted, the dresses were fine, The orchestra well fill'd, and the acting—divine. In truth, such perfection in women and men Was ne'er seen before, nor will e'er be again; Captain Campbell gave Othman with strength and effect, Mr. Trafford was graceful—Lord John was correct; Lord Lorne's easy air, when he got in a passion, Proved a tyrant must needs be a person of fashion; He seem'd much at home thro' the whole of the play,— He died in a style which was quite dégagé; And his orders for murder, declared by their tone, Was the same if he gave them, or let them alone. The worst (we are sorry to say, but it true is) Was the epilogue, written, we hear, by one Lewis; 'Twas terrible trash, but in justice we tell, It was thought to be spoken uncommonly well. Indeed, Lady Charlotte, all own'd with delight, Outdid all her former outdoings that night. When she got her high prancing theatrical pony on, Her voice, air, and action, how truly Sidonian! How wisely she said she'd not marry her brother, And, having one spouse, not just then take another. And when, in the midst of her griefs and vexations, 'Twas needful to rap out a few execrations, Her oaths were as truly deserving of praise, As she had done nothing but swear all her days.” Perhaps some may think, but the fact I deny, My own merits are rated a little too high. But if in our play any merit is shown, I assure you, my friends, that the whole is my own. I made up the dresses, I painted the scenes— For constructing the playhouse, invented machines; And made all the actors rehearse, which I swear, Was without great exertion no easy affair. For when to rehearse the fifth act I was wishing, I was told Barbarossa was just gone a fishing Out of tune, while Irene was straining her throat, That Othman was busy in building a boat. However, I scolded, and bustled, and storm'd, Till the parts were all learnt and the play was perform'd. And now Barbarossa's heroics are o'er, Should you chance, as is likely, to vote him a bore,— Should you think our performance deserving no praise, And our play the worst thing you e'er saw in your days, As your judgments must err, and an audience is scarce, We condemn you for penance to sit out the farce. THE CLERICAL MUSICIAN. Most of Lewis's productions were illustrated by coloured sketches from his truly humorous pencil. A SONG. Tune.—“The De'il cam fiddling.” The priest came fiddling through the town, And to dancing set the ladies, Though fiddling in a parson's gown A most improper trade is. Yet he fiddled away, he fiddled away, While merily danced the ladies; Oh, mon'y braw thanks to the mickle black priest Who to dancing set the ladies! Their hearts all jump'd with joy I swear, When the fiddle he laid his paws on; But he play'd so ill that “Non temar” Wasn't known from “Nancy Dawson.” Still he fiddled away, he fiddled away, &amp;c. Of the ugliest airs this priest did know Right well a monstrous cargo; He play'd whatever was presto slow, And quick whatever was largo. And he fiddled away, &amp;c. He play'd by ear, and his ear was false, And much his hearers grumbled; For he strumm'd jig, minuet, reel, and valse, And altogether he jumbled. While he fiddled away, &amp;c. He practis'd morning, night, and noon, But though he well intended, He always too soon reach'd the midst of the tune, And began where he ought to have ended. Yet he fiddled away, &amp;c. But what you'll think extremely odd, Though at music he was but a spoon, sir, Sing Hey-diddle, at the sound of his fiddle, The cow jump'd over the moon, sir. And he fiddled away, he fiddled away, While merrily danc'd the ladies. Oh, mony braw thanks to the mickle black priest, Who to dancing set the ladies! THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO FOUND A SILVER PENNY. Some six years ago (or perhaps it was more), As a little old woman was sweeping her floor, She saw something glisten, when, lo! on the ground, Adzookers! a penny of silver she found. To market next morning she fail'd not to jig, And there by good chafering bought a fine pig; For chronicles tell (and perhaps they tell true), That pigs then were plenty, and pennies were few. The pig it was stubborn, the pig it was strong; It squeak'd and it struggled the whole way along, Till it came to a stile—then, good lack! what a pother, For pig wouldn't go either one way or t'other! Sore distress'd was the dame, when a Dog came in sight; So says she, “Honest Tray, take the trouble to bite This pig, who won't cross yonder stile to the right, And I fear that I shan't reach my cottage to-night.” “I bite him?” quoth Tray: “sure you're running your riggs; I'll not injure a hair of his tail, please the pigs! And I'd have you to know too (he added with smiles), They are only lame dogs that I help over stiles.” For a stick to avenge her, the dame now looked round; And soon for her purpose a stout one she found. Which proving no green one, but rather a dry log, Said, “Ma'am, I must tell you, that dog is a sly dog; And if I should twig him in fashion so queer, 'Tis, doubtless, a crab-stick he'd think me, I fear. I've met many pigs and old women before, And always found one of the party a bore.” Then the little old woman—my stars! how she bounc'd! Her nose and chin toss'd, and her petticoats flounc'd; When just at the moment pass'd by an old flame, Whose acquaintance and aid she fail'd not to claim; And says she, “My brave spark, do light on yon stick, Who refuses that rude mangy puppy to lick, Who vainly I ask piggy-wiggy to bite, Who won't cross the stile out of obstinate spite, And I fear I shan't get to my cottage to night.” Thus Goody petition'd; but, 'twixt me and you, Her flame look'd and listen'd, and look'd rather blue; And then, too, like many a wandering spark, He led her a dance, to be left in the dark. The dame with vexation had dropt, but that near A sweet singing rivulet chancing to hear, That onwards was rambling all life and all light, With Heaven-lit bosom all things making bright; Says she, “Pretty Brooklet, the courage now cool Of yon saucy spark, just to prove him a fool.” Said the Brook, “Ma'am, excuse me, for should quarrels muddle My life's tranquil way, I should prove a mere puddle.” So, murmuring on in her sweet woodland strain, The brook sought her own peaceful valley again. Screams the Dame, “You're a ?,” but by the way, Whate'er the old woman was going to say, For the sake of good breeding, 'twere best to forget, As folks seldom compliment when in a pet. However, she luckily then chanced to spy A Bull at his meals in the meadow hard by; And she pray'd of the Brook he would take a good sup, And wash down his dinner by drinking it up. But the Bull in this instance behaved like a bear, And bellow'd and bounc'd like a debutante player. “Be warned—keep your distance!” he roars, “my old Venus; Lest, deciding the odds, be a toss up between us!” At length the poor Dame met a spruce looking blade, (In fact, the young man was a butcher by trade); She told her sad story of passion and pig,— The fellow was arch, and answered in gig: “'Twixt you and your pig, ma'am, should I interfere, Perhaps I might catch ‘the wrong sow by the ear!’” Our Dame was despairing, when with a new hope, Delighted she look'd on a tough sturdy rope. “Oh! hang him,” she cried, “yon saucy young man!” Says the rope, “Ma'am, for you, I'll do all that I can; So as for the business, there'll soon be an end on't, My yarn is well spliced, ma'am, and you may depend on't.” The dame felt the sneer; but just then so pat, Her pathway of trouble was cross'd by a rat: Says the little old woman, “Good even, my friend; Oblige me by gnawing yon shabby rope's end!” “Take heed,” he replied, “when you ask folks to gnaw, Pray bait with a pleasanter task for their jaw. 'Tis awkward,” adds he of the dwelling beneath, “To greet one by throwing rope's end in one's teeth.” Ill-timed this advice, for a hungry cat Passing by, says the Dame, “Pussy, eat up that rat!” “Ah, ha! Dame, you've hit it—your triumph's complete; So home to your cottage, while I win the meat!” 'Twas thus spoke Grimalkin, the liquorish Cat, Who sprang to devour the terrified Rat, Who lost not a moment the tough Rope to gnaw, Who hastened a noose round the Butcher to draw, Who quickly prepar'd the proud Bull to slaughter, Who had now no objection to swallow the Water, Who hastened as quickly the Fire to drown, Who hurried to burn the rough Bramble twig down, Who belabour'd the Dog with his strongest of might, Who snapped Piggy-wiggy—hurrah! for his bite; For, 'tis said, the old Woman got safe home that night. The Moral. No finger stirs, in vain you kneel and sue, The work brings benefit to none but you; Must, to exert themselves, your friends be won, Make it their interest, and the work is done. THE VILLAGE CONJURER. Come round me, good people, your fortunes to know, The present, the future, and past, can I show; In the lines of your hands I can destiny read, For I know hocus-pocus as well as my creed. I am called Aristophilas Habi Baboon, I am old as the stars, and was born in the moon; I shall live to the year seven thousand and five, And mere hocus-pocus will keep me alive! Stop, stop, pretty damsel, your hand let me see, You shall hear if you'll husbands have, one, two, or three; If handsome or ugly, if brown or if fair, By dint of my art, I can tell to a hair. If any fair maid should be anxious to send A few tender lines to some far-distant friend, If touch'd by my wand, (it can scarce be believ'd) In less than five minutes, her letter's receiv'd! If any good dame should be anxious to learn Why the cows have the murrain—her butter won't churn; Should imps in her kitchen, or bairns make a rout, Before she counts five, I can find the witch out. Any spinster, who somewhat advanc'd is in life, And begins to despair to be ever a wife, May here buy six husbands, or should she choose more, An additional shilling will purchase a score! But should some too simple and credulous maid, By the oaths of her lover seduc'd and betray'd, Endeavour by witchcraft to lighten her pain, And try hocus-pocus to bring back her swain,— With a fee in her hand, and a tear in her eye, Should she come to my door, and complain with a sigh: “False Robin is gone, and I'm ruin'd, alack! Oh! dear Mr. Conjurer, make him come back!” 'Tis here, I confess the defect of my art,— My spells have no power to cure a false heart: The flame must for ever extinguish'd remain, For the devil himself could not light it again! THE ADIEU. Yes! dearest girl, the time is past When, rural pleasures flying, You seek the busy town, while here I stay, in absence sighing! But seated at some splendid show, When all with pleasure eye you, Oh! then on me one thought bestow, And wish that I were nigh you. Till summer brings thee back, my love, Of pomp and tumult weary, The heavy hours will slowly move, And all be chill and dreary. Fair spring in vain will boast her reign, And trees their leaves recover; While, far from thee, it still must be December with thy lover. THE BUTTERFLY. Still free from thought, and free from sorrow, Wave, lovely fly, thy wings in play; Though Time may clip those wings to-morrow, An age of bliss is thine to-day. Would that thy life's short, happy measure Were mine,—but, ah! that wish is vain; Still must thou sport through days of pleasure, While I still sigh through years of pain! SONG. [When last I saw this well-known bower] When last I saw this well-known bower, It seem'd most fresh and fair; What brilliant tints adorn'd each flower! How balmy breathed the air! The linnet pour'd from yonder spray Notes sweet and clear; And all was lovely, all was gay, For—she was here! But now the flowers no sweets exhale, Lost is their vivid dye; And, murmuring low, each passing gale Seems freighted with a sigh. The warbled notes untuneful sound, Each charm is fled; And all seems dark and sad around, For—she is dead! LOVE AND TIME. “Why dost thou shun me?”—thus, with wrath inflamed, One day, accosting Cupid, Time exclaim'd. “Why must complaints for ever stun my ears, That Love still flies the moment Time appears?” “Yours is the fault,” said Love; “so swift your pace, Speed how I may, your wings still win the race: Morn, noon, and night, some nymph or shepherd sighs, ‘When Love is with us, oh! how swift Time flies!’” CHAPTER VIII. “The Castle Spectre”—“The Minister”—“Rolla”—“The Twins” —“Adelmorn the Outlaw”—“Alfonso”—“The Captive”— “The Bravo of Venice,” &amp;c. &amp;c. THE CAPTIVE. The scene represents a dungeon, in which is a grated door, guarded by strong bars and chains. In the upper part is an open gallery, leading to the cells above. Slow and melancholy music. The Captive is discovered in the attitude of hopeless grief:—she is in chains;—her eyes are fixed, with a vacant stare, and her hands are folded. After a pause, the Gaoler is seen passing through the upper gallery with a lamp: he appears at the grate, and opens the door. The noise of the bars falling rouses the Captive. She looks round eagerly; but on seeing the Gaoler enter, she waves her hand mournfully, and relapses into her former stupor. The Gaoler replenishes a jug with water, and places a loaf of bread by her side. He then prepares to leave the dungeon, when the Captive seems to resolve on making an attempt to excite his compassion: she rises from her bed of straw, clasps his hand, and sinks at his feet. The music ceases, and she speaks. “Stay, gaoler, stay, and hear my woe! She is not mad who kneels to thee: For what I'm now too well I know, And what I was, and what should be. I'll rave no more in proud despair; My language shall be calm, though sad; But yet I'll firmly, truly swear I am not mad! [then kissing his hand] I am not mad! [He offers to leave her; she detains him, and continues, in a tone of eager persuasion,] A tyrant husband forged the tale Which chains me in this dreary cell; My fate, unknown, my friends bewail— Oh! gaoler, haste, that fate to tell. Oh! haste, my father's heart to cheer; That heart, at once, 'twill grieve and glad To know, though kept a captive here, I am not mad! not mad! not mad! [Harsh music, while the Gaoler, with a look of contempt and disbelief, forces his hand from her grasp, and leaves her. The bars are heard replacing.] He smiles in scorn!— He turns the key! He quits the grate!—I knelt in vain! Still—still, his glimmering lamp I see.” [Music expressing the light growing fainter, as the Gaoler retires through the gallery, and the Captive watches his departure with eager looks.] 'Tis lost!—and all is gloom again. [She shivers, and wraps her garment more closely round her.] Cold!—bitter cold!—no warmth!—no light! Life! all thy comforts once I had; Yet, here I'm chain'd this freezing night, [Eagerly.] Although not mad! no, no, no, no—not mad! [A few bars of melancholy music, which she interrupts, by exclaiming suddenly,] 'Tis sure a dream?—some fancy vain! [Proudly.] I—I, the child of rank and wealth! Am I the wretch who clanks this chain, Deprived of freedom, friends, and health? Oh! while I count those blessings fled, Which never more my hours must glad, How aches my heart!—how burns my head!— [Interrupting herself hastily, and pressing her hands forcibly against her forehead.] But 'tis not mad!—no, 'tis not mad! [She remains fixed in this attitude, with a look of fear, till the music, changing, expresses that some tender, melancholy reflection has passed her mind.] My child! Ah! hast thou not forgot, by this, Thy mother's face—thy mother's tongue? She'll ne'er forget your parting kiss, [With a smile.] Nor round her neck how fast you clung; Nor how you sued with her to stay; Nor how that suit your sire forbad! [With agony.] Nor how— [With a look of terror.] I'll drive such thoughts away; [In a hollow hurried voice.] They'll make me mad! They'll make me mad! [A pause—she then proceeds with a melancholy smile,] His rosy lips, how sweet they smiled! His mild blue eyes how bright they shone! Was never born a lovelier child, [With a sudden burst of passionate grief, approaching to frenzy.] And art thou now for ever gone? And must I never see thee more? My pretty, pretty, pretty lad! [With energy.] I will be free! [Endeavouring to force the grate.] Unbar this door! I am not mad! I am not mad! [She falls, exhausted, against the grate, by the bars of which she supports herself. She is roused from her stupor by loud shrieks, rattling of chains, &amp;c.] Hark! hark!—What mean those yells—those cries? [The noise grows louder.] His chain some furious madman breaks! [The madman is seen to rush along the gallery with a blazing firebrand in his hand.] He comes! I see his glaring eyes! [The madman appears at the grate, which he endeavours to force, while she shrinks in an agony of terror.] Now! now! my dungeon bars he shakes Help! help! [Scared by her cries, the madman quits the grate.] [The madman again appears above, is seized by his keepers, with torches; and after some resistance, is dragged away.] He's gone!— Oh! fearful woe, Such screams to hear—such sights to see! My brain! my brain!—I know, I know I am not mad, but soon shall be. Yes—soon! for, lo! yon—while I speak— Mark yonder demon's eyeballs glare! He sees me!—now, with dreadful shriek, He whirls a scorpion high in air! Horror!—the reptile strikes his tooth Deep in my heart, so crush'd and sad: Ay!—laugh, ye fiends!—I feel the truth! 'Tis done! 'tis done! [With a loud shriek.] I'm mad!—I'm mad! [She dashes herself in frenzy upon the ground.] The two Brothers cross the gallery, dragging the Gaoler; then a servant appears with a torch, conducting the Father, who is supported by his youngest daughter. They are followed by servants with torches, part of whom remain in the gallery. The Brothers appear at the grate, which they force the Gaoler to open; they enter, and on seeing the Captive, one is struck with sorrow, while the other expresses violent anger against the Gaoler, who endeavours to excuse himself; the Father and Sister enter, and approach the Captive, offering to raise her, when she starts up suddenly, and eyes them with a look of terror: they endeavour to make themselves known to her, but in vain; she shuns them, with fear and aversion, and taking some straw, begins to twine it into a crown, when her eyes falling on the Gaoler, she shrieks in terror, and hides her face; the Gaoler is ordered to retire, and obeys; the Father again endeavours to awaken her attention, but in vain. He covers his face with his handkerchief, which the Captive draws away with a look of surprise. Their hopes are excited, and they watch her with eagerness. She wipes the old man's eyes with her hair, which she afterwards touches, and finding it wet with tears, bursts into a delirious laugh, resumes her crown of straw, and after working at it eagerly for a moment, suddenly drops it, and remains motionless with a vacant stare. The Father, &amp;c., express their despair of her recovery—the music ceases. An old servant enters, leading her child, who advances with a careless look; but on seeing his mother, breaks from the servant, runs to her, and clasps her hand. She looks at him with a vacant stare, then, with an expression of excessive joy, exclaims “My child!” sinks on her knees, and clasps him to her bosom. The Father, &amp;c., raise their hands to heaven, in gratitude for the return of her reason, and the curtain falls slowly to solemn music. CHAPTER IX. Ballads and Melodies. THE SOLDIER'S DEPARTURE. Kate.— The boatswain is calling, my heart aches with fear, While I think of those perils which threaten my dear! But my heart would fear no perils, no sorrows should I know, If you'd let me go with you—Jack. Oh! no, my love, no! Jack.— Where honour now calls me my love must not be; To conquer or die must your Jack plough the sea: Yet one fear, I own, alarms me:—since far away I go, Ah! won't you forget me?Kate. Oh! no, my love, no!Kate.— For should my Jack fall on some far distant shore,Jack.— And when I return, should my Kate be no more,Kate.—This heart which once I gave him,Jack.This love which now I show,Both.—Should it e'er be another's?—Oh! no, my love, no! THE GREEK GIRL'S SONG AT THE FOUNTAIN. I've cross'd the steep mountain, I've cross'd the shady dell; “Go, pretty maid,” My mother said, “Draw water from the well; And soon reach the fountain, And soon return to me; Nor stay to greet The youths you meet, Whatever youths they be.” Assist me, good stranger, Or else I shall be chid; Ah! roll away The stone, I pray, That forms the fountain's lid. Ah! save me from anger,— The stone I can't remove; And Venus bless With all success, Yourself, and her you love! And now, steps of fleetness My homeward path shall greet; The pitcher's weight, Alas! is great,— The sand, too, burns my feet! But soon smiles of sweetness My troubles shall requite; A mother's kiss Shall pain dismiss, For love makes labour light. BALLAD. THE SOLDIER'S GRAVE. “Oh! cold is the night, and the rain it beats hard; Why com'st thou, fair damsel, to Guildford churchyard?” “Nay, heed me not, stranger; no terrors appal, For chill though the rain drops, my tears faster fall.” “But why is the rose from your cheek fled away? And where is the soldier, so gallant and gay?” “Oh! sorrow has wither'd health's roses so sweet, And the gay, gallant soldier lies dead at my feet.” “Now tell me, fair damsel, then, what shall I do, To soothe the distress of thy bosom so true?” “Oh! return in the morning, and close where you see The grave of a soldier make there one for me.” His heart it was sad at thus hearing her rave; He return'd in the morning, but dug not her grave: For his courtship soon making her sorrow discard, Now forgot lies the soldier in Guildford churchyard. WILLIAM; OR, THE SAILOR BOY. 'Midst the shrouds the wind is sighing, Cold and chilly falls the dew; Swift the moonbeams onwards flying, Faintly tinge the waters blue. Every sailor now is sleeping, With his daily toil oppress'd; I alone consume in weeping Hours, by nature meant for rest! Wind, whose current briskly blowing, Swift its course to England bends, Would with thee I home were going To my country and my friends! Tell, ah! tell my sorrowing mother, How with her I long to be; How in vain I strive to smother What I suffer here at sea! Still the sailors mock my anguish, Strike me when they see my tears; Still are angry that I languish, Till our vessel homeward steers. Can I help it? Here, to grieve me, Fears, and taunts, and blows I find; There with kindness all receive me, All are gentle, all are kind! In my mem'ry fresh as ever Lives the hour of parting still; Sore my mother grieved to sever From her little darling Will. All our friends in Wapping-alley Came a last farewell to take; Brother Jack, and sister Sally, Sobb'd as if their hearts would break! Then said I, No longer sorrow That your Will to sea is sent; Gone to-day—I'm back to-morrow Ten times richer than I went. Trees of jewels rare are growing In the climes beyond the main; Soon with wealth my chest o'erflowing, You shall see me here again! Then I told them, with what pleasure, When from India I came back, Sally's lap I'd fill with treasure, And would buy a horse for Jack. Told them, how would I and brother Live as gay as little kings; Told them how should Sal and mother Flaunt with caps, silk gowns, and rings. Soon these dreams of gladness left me— Ah! I still regret their loss; Soon of every joy bereft me, My companions stern and cross! While on shore they spoke me kindly, Gave me grog, and laugh'd and play'd; Swore they loved me—I too blindly Still believed whate'er they said! But, too late, I find their way is, Ill the young and weak to treat; Find a powder-monkey's pay is Hearty kicks, and nought to eat! Now the surly boatswain licks me— “Curse the little sniv'ling dog!” Now the haughty captain kicks me,— “Here, my lads, the rascal flog!” Each the tyrant's justice praises, While the boatswain's sturdy arm High the cat-o'-nine-tails raises, And delights to work my harm! Mother! how you'd curse the hour When you sent your boy to sea, Could you view the faces sour, Smiling at the harsh decree! How you'd grieve with eyes full streaming, Could you hear me grace implore, Struggling, writhing, sobbing, screaming, While the lash is dyed with gore! But what makes this change of weather? Wherefore mounts the sea so high? Wherefore flock the clouds together? Gracious Heaven! a storm is nigh. Fearful is the sea's commotion, How the winds the topsails tear! How with light'ning flames the ocean! Shield us! what a flash was there! Now his whistle shrilly blowing, Hark! the boatswain wakes the crew! Louder still the wind is growing, Never wilder tempest blew. Happy sister! happy brother! Ye are safe on England's shore: England! England! Mother! Mother! Must I never see ye more? Never! 'tis decreed I perish! Death rolls on with yonder wave: Farewell ye, I love and cherish— These dark billows are my grave! THE ANCIENT MARINER'S FIRESIDE. 'Twas a sun-burnt sailor, weak and old, but still whose heart was gay; The fire play'd kindly on his face, and gilt his locks so gray; A roguish boy, his grandsire's joy, he danced upon his knee, And rock'd him to and fro, and sang, “Yo ho! sweet boy, yo ye!” My son, I've been in many a fight, and thought that death was nigh, But as I never lived in sin, I never fear'd to die: And storms have roar'd, and torrents pour'd, around my bark and me, But Conscience slept, and so did I: “Yo ho! sweet boy, yo ye!” I once was captured by the foe, and lost six pounds eleven; But as the poor shared half my wealth, one half was safe in Heaven. Come what come will, come good, come ill—then, dying, cry like me, “God bless the king, and native land! Yo ho! sweet boy, yo ye!” THE SAILOR-BOY'S DITTY. The crew is at rest! but I, poor Sailor-boy, In vain strive to slumber; I sleep not for joy; For homewards I'm going, and soon shall once more Be prest to the hearts of my friends upon shore. Yo—ye! yo—ye! stormy winds are blowing; Waves like mountains round the ship are flowing. Blow on, ye winds! flow on, ye waves! No more from home ye tear me. Winds blow! Waves flow! And back to Britain bear me! On board the Bill-ruffian we sail'd, and we soon Fell in with and captured a Spanish galleon. Now, light is my bosom—of gold I have store; That gold shall be yours, dear friends, upon shore. Yo—ye! yo—ye! stormy winds are blowing; Waves like mountains round the ship are flowing. Blow on, ye winds! flow on, ye waves! No more from home ye tear me. Winds blow! Waves flow! And back to Britain bear me! While viewing my treasure with joy and surprise, My playfellow, Polly, will scarce trust her eyes; My gold in my kind mother's apron I'll pour, And glad the good hearts of my friends upon shore. Yo—ye! yo—ye! stormy winds are blowing; Waves, like mountains, round the ship are flowing. Blow on, ye winds! flow on, ye waves! No more from home ye tear me. Winds blow! Waves flow! And back to Britain bear me! JACK'S COMPLAINT. The winds of night, with hollow sound, Across the waters sweep; The careless crew in sleep are bound, While I the mid-watch keep: And as along the deck I rove, My burden still must be, 'Tis sad to think, that she I love Ne'er bends one thought on me. Though long with hope she fed my flame, And seem'd that flame to share; A gayer, richer lover came, And won th'inconstant fair. Yet still to faithless Susan's charms My heart shall constant be; Though, clasp'd within my rival's arms, She thinks no more on me. I felt, when on the point to go, My breast with anguish swell; While she, unmoved, beheld my woe, Nor once said “Friend, farewell!”— But from the pain it now endures Death soon my heart shall free; That heart, false girl, which still is yours, Though you ne'er think on me. Heav'n grant my doubts may be unjust! But, oh! I strangely fear; Your lover will betray his trust, And cost you many a tear. You then, perhaps, that scorn may hate Which drove me forth to sea; And oft (but 'twill be then too late) May sigh, and think on me. THE DISABLED SEAMAN. Aid a sailor, kind sirs, who once made it his glory, His country to fight for, his king to defend; Oh! tarry a moment to hear his sad story, And deign, when 'tis ended, his wants to befriend. I once had a sweetheart, her vows I shall never Forget, when she said how it grieved her to part; And that, happen what might, she would love me, if never Time ere should have alter'd the truth of my heart. From Plymouth we sailed, the foe gave us battle, And I was resolved, sirs, to conquer or die; Undaunted around me I heard the balls rattle, And lost in the contest an arm and an eye. Yet I thought not the loss of a limb, in my duty, To me or to Nancy could sorrow impart; One eye was still left me to gaze on her beauty, And I knew what she prized in me most, was my heart. We fought and we conquer'd, and gain'd Plymouth harbour; But, when Nancy beheld my unfortunate plight, Next morning she married Fred Frizzle the barber, And bade me no more enter into her sight. Now lame, poor, and helpless, through famed London city I wander, my hardships and woes to impart; So list to a sailor, kind masters, in pity, Deprived of an eye, and an arm,—and a heart. THE MARS, CAPTAIN CONNOR. A bankrupt in trade, fortune frowning on shore, All lost, save my spirit and honour; No choice being left but to handle the oar, I've embark'd in the Mars, Captain Connor. Yet ere the wind serves, some few words to say To Polly, these moments I'll borrow: For surely she'll grieve that I leave her to-day, And must sail on the salt seas to-morrow! Oh weep not, though Fortune her smile now denies, Time may soften the gipsy's displeasure; Perhaps she may throw in my way some rich prize, And send me back loaded with treasure. If so lucky, oh doubt not, without more delay, Home I'll hasten to banish your sorrow; So cheerly! let's hope that our parting to-day, Prove the eve of some happier morrow. PLY THE OAR, BROTHER. A FISHERMAN'S TRIO. Solo, Master Duruset. Hark how the neighbouring convent's bell Throws o'er the wave its vesper swell! Sullen it booms from shore to shore, Blending its chimes with the dash of the oar. POOR ANNE. The heart of Anne young Henry won, But love much sorrow wrought her! For Henry was a monarch's son, Poor Anne—a shepherd's daughter. He said “A queen must be my bride,” Of Anne his last leave taking: She kiss'd his hand, but nought replied, Poor girl!—her heart was breaking. He who her simple heart had won, And love and sorrow taught her; Would he had been a shepherd's son, Or she some lordling's daughter. His parting step she fondly eyed, But not one word was spoken; Then down she laid her head and died: Poor girl!—her heart was broken. JEANNIE. A Song. Oh lady gay! your arts forbear, Your charms are spread in vain; Oh! lady gay, demand nae mair What is nae mair mine ain! My heart is only Jeannie's, The flower of bra' Dundee; Right weel I love that bonnie lass, And she as weel loves me! In vain your jewels brightly gleam, And canty lustre dart; For Jeannie's een mair brightly beam, Mair precious is her heart; And mine is only Jeannie's, The flower of bra' Dundee; Right weel I love that bonnie lass, And she as weel loves me. I will nae bear your daddy's frown, Wha'd glint and gloom at me; Gin ye should wed wi' sic a clown, Possess'd of no bawbee. No! I'll have nane but Jeannie, The flower of bra' Dundee; Right weel I love that bonnie lass, And she as weel loves me. I will nae bear your brother's scorn, Who sair would fume and fret, Gin wi' a swain sae basely born In wedlock's bands ye met. So I'll hae nane but Jeannie, The flower of bra' Dundee; Right weel I love that bonnie lass, And she as weel loves me. My Jeannie would nae grudge to leave The wealthiest laird for me; And, oh! her heart I would not grieve For a' the sun can see; Then gang your gait now, Lady fair, And come nae mair to woo; Nor think my Jeannie I'll forswear, De'il take me gin I do! CHAPTER XI. Cottage at Barnes—Fête champêtre—Character of Lewis's friends —Monody on the Death of Sir John Moore—Duke of Clarence —Princess of Wales—Affair of honour THE SCYTHE OF TIME. Blest was their way, Youth hail'd the hours, In warbling numbers, over flowers, Like bird of summer sky; While as a dew-drop that's still bright, Lingers in violet bell, the light Beam'd from Love's bashful eye; Hand press'd in hand, they pass'd along, Youth with Love still blending song; And oh! he vow'd in truth, All changeful skies he would deride, If with him Love would still abide. Such was thy theme, fond Youth! Now both, it seems, had heard or read Of Time, but how could either dread A bugbear neither knew? Besides Love boasted spells, whose power Full well could guard his fairy bower; Be sure Youth thought so too. Indeed the elves did frankly own, That oft as by them Time had flown, To banish every care His glass Love stole, while Youth combined To cheat their foe, who oft did find Much mischief planning there. Then, too, Youth told how by Love's hand Time's scythe was wreath'd like fairy wand, So gay with bud and flower; As life's enchantments meant to aid, Instead of warning how they fade With Time's untarrying hour. How long 'twas thus their lot to rove, Could neither tell, gay Youth or Love, Or how the bright hours flew; (And who could ever tell the hours If Love intwined Time's scythe with flowers? Ah! none that Youth e'er knew.) But as we know life's fairest day, Like all fair things, will pass away, And best of friends must part; So when his last those flowers to view, And o'er departed youth to strew, Love wept with all his heart. Reflection, who in tranquil cell Oft welcom'd Time, and prized him well, Love to console, drew nigh, To hear him call old Time his friend, Who much had taught him to amend— 'Twere well had Youth been by. “Henceforth,” he said, “at Honour's shrine Esteem must rear, and Friendship twine, The hues of Youth's bright way. So shall Time spare Love's fairy bowers, And his rough scythe be wreathed with flowers, E'en in life's winter day.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. THE CONSOLER. It seem'd as nature's flame were dead—no beam From sun or moon diffused its cheering gleam O'er that dark sky, at morn which seem'd so fair,— It thence seem'd darker now: the murky air, Close, thick, and lowering, with its burden prest The spirits down, and clogg'd the lab'ring breast. The birds sat mournful, silent on the spray, And wild and waste the soul's Elysium lay, Spoil'd of its floral treasure: cankering want And sorrows worm had kill'd health's blooming plant, And the fond sunflower turn'd no more its eye Where orient lustre fired the eastern sky: The primrose youth was dead, untimely dead, And each fair flower no more a fragrance shed; And bliss (that empress rose), whose odorous power, And blushing cups at morn's delicious hour, Pour'd in my senses from its emerald seats A blaze of beauties, and a cloud of sweets, Now, lost its glowing gems and green attire, Met my sad eyes—a rude unsightly briar Threaten'd my hands with wounds as near I drew, And wept its vanish'd flowers in tears of dew. Oh! I was sad at soul! no aid was nigh; No present joy, no future hope; mine eye Where'er in suppliant anxious search I turn'd, 'Twas anguish—'twas despair! My bosom burn'd, My heart was broken now: in sullen mood, 'Mid dull, dark apathy I silent stood, Like one to marble changed; and now again Wild memory flash'd her torch athwart my brain, And fired it into madness. Then the ground I struck with burning front, and scatter'd round Locks of torn hair; and still in frantic tone Of mingled rage and pain, half-shriek, half-groan, I raved of honest hearts with treachery paid, Of feigned love, false friends, and trust betray'd; And cursed, in bitter grief and fury vain, Man's flinty heart and woman's fickle brain. When, lo! as thus in maniac state I lay, A matron tow'rds me turn'd her graceful way: With stately step she moved; her robes of white, Of vestal make, though not so dazzling bright, Were pure as virtue's own; and o'er her head A cypress veil in decent guise was spread, Fix'd on her forehead by a sacred wreath, And pass'd in graceful folds her chin beneath, Inspiring awe, but awe unmix'd with fear. Calm was her cloudless eye—her brow so clear From wrinkles, spoke (though pale), a heart which ne'er Had known the withering touch of guilt or care. A bowl, around whose brim the poppy reign'd, In her right-hand she bore; her left sustain'd A mirror, on whose polish'd breast was shown A thousand mingling shapes of things unknown; Where Fancy bade th'enraptured thought unite All that was pure and precious, fair and bright. Yet what those objects were, in vain mine eyes I strain'd to know; for still would mists arise; While o'er the crystal surface as they play'd, Confounded light with light, and shade with shade. Yet, oh! so beauteous show'd those clouded views, So bright those forms confused, and doubtful hues, I thought, while gazing on their lines obscure, All witness'd pomp seem'd mean—all dreamt of, poor. She waved her hand—the cloud dispersed. 'Tis true, The gaudy sun no dazzling splendours threw Athwart Heaven's vault; but that clear tranquil gray O'erspread the skies, which ushers in new day. With lofty head and port majestic came The noble footstep of that awful dame; And as she pass'd, oft cropp'd some drooping flower, Whose beauties bloom'd unmark'd in sunless bower, Till pluck'd by her: then first perceived the eye Its form how graceful, and how rich its dye! As on she moved, want, sorrow, pain, and care, Fled from her glance, and sought less sacred air. Sooth'd by her voice, inveterate Malice pour'd His arrows at her feet, and broke his sword. Deep slumbers bound the Passions' stormy train,— No more did Slander hiss, or hiss'd in vain; And where that matron's hallow'd steps once trod, Envy herself with flowers oft strew'd the sod. With awful hope I gazed, while near she drew, And from her bowl, on my burnt forehead threw Some opiate drops. Oh! then how swift my soul Cast off its burden! grateful languor stole O'er all my frame, and soon my temples round, Sleep, with soft hand, her wreath of poppies wound, Yet e'er I sunk to rest—“Oh! then” I said, “Pain's readiest balm, and Sorrow's surest aid, Whose power can every pang and pain repel, Oh! friend of misery, deign thy name to tell.” I paused: her gracious smile consent reveal'd; With holiest kiss my weary eyes she seal'd, And while her lips inhaled my sighing breath, Softly she whisper'd, “Friend, my name is Death!” THE LOST SHILLING. August 30, 1802. Oh! sad and slow his footsteps fell, As home the boy was going, And sorrow bade his bosom swell, And fast his tears were flowing. While sadly follow'd at his heel, As conscious of disaster, A rough-hair'd cur, and seem'd to feel The anguish of his master. “Now, bonny boy, what makes thee cry?” “Oh! bitter fears torment me: In yonder town, her food to buy, This morn my mother sent me. “And now to see her face I dread,— From anger nought can save me; For, oh! I lost, as on I sped, The shilling which she gave me.” “That sure can ne'er a fault be styled, From mere mischance proceeding; Yet will your mother beat you, child, In spite of tears and pleading?” “Oh no, sir, no! If blows be all, To bear them I'd be willing, Though hard those blows, as arm could fall; But 'twas her only shilling.” ‘And hard will be her fare to-day, And hard her fast to-morrow; And when she hungers, sure she'll say, 'Twas I who caused her sorrow!” “Now hush your sighs, and dry your tears,— Your loss no more shall grieve you; Look, bonny boy! from cares and fears This shilling shall relieve you.” A doubting hope illumed his eyes, The sight his tears suspended; While to receive the silver prize His hand the boy extended. 'Twas his—he fled with eager pace, No thanks to me addressing; But, oh! the smile which deck'd his face Was better than a blessing! THE BLIND LOVER. 'Tis true, my love, of heavenly light These sightless orbs admit no ray; Dark are to me the stars of night, And blush of morn and blaze of day. Yet think not, sweet, the want of eyes Can e'er thine Arthur's peace destroy; While Mary's hand that want supplies, And kindly guides her poor blind boy! Oft when of loss of sight I speak, I hear you breathe a tender sigh; And oft I feel on Arthur's cheek A tear which fell from Mary's eye: Which when I feel—which when I hear, Not worlds could yield me half such joy As that one sigh, as that one tear, Which pity gives the poor blind boy! I boast no treasure, but a heart— 'Tis thine, and thine shall still remain; I boast no science, but the art To make sweet music's pensive strain. Yet, if it wakes one pleasing thought, When thus my hands the lute employ, Ah! 'twas because my Mary taught That science to her poor blind boy. Though knowledge hides her stores from me, And glory's clarions vainly call, In place of these, Heaven gave me thee, And giving thee, it gave me all. And while of love I hear thee tell, And cherish hope and promise joy, Oh! kings and sages sure might well With envy view the poor blind boy! EPITAPH ON A YOUNG LADY. Though lost the charms her face display'd, And cold that heart which loved so well, Know in the form here lowly laid That once an angel deign'd to dwell. Alike to God and mortals dear, Too soon she fled from earthly eyes; Could love, could grief have kept her here, An angel had not sought the skies. ELEGY On the approaching Departure of a Friend, 1798. I On yon dark hills the tempest fiend is sitting, Loud roars the blast, cold rains my bosom beat; Curlews and screaming sea-gulls round are flitting, High roll the waves, and burst before my feet. II Here to myself a few short moments stealing, While hoarded anguish labours for relief, I may awhile indulge the flow of feeling, Ease my foul heart, and give a loose to grief. III Here freight unseen, each wave with drops of sorrow, Here swell unheard, with sighs each passing gale; Waves that must waft my Edward hence to-morrow, Gales that must too soon speed his parting sail. IV Yes, he must go, and nought should now restrain him,— Ev'n I, since duty calls should blame delay; Yes, he must go, I strive not to retain him, Nor, though I mourn his absence, wish his stay. V Rebellion waves on high her standard gory, Proud Gallia's vessels plough the Irish wave; And shall I blame his generous thirst for glory? And shall I grieve, because his soul is brave? VI No! rather still to fan my lips shall labour In his young heart the bright heroic flame; Rather my hand in his shall place the sabre, And bid it boldly hew the path to fame. VII Bid that it ne'er be seen in battle swerving,— Bid it in strength and temper matchless be; That I one day may bless it for preserving A life more valued than mine own to me. VIII Yet though no murmur, fate's decree accusing, Bid my heart swell or freight my faltering voice, Must I not feel some pang my Edward losing, Friend of my judgment, brother of my choice? IX Must I not wish the storm no longer blowing, Whose blasts already shake our friendship's shrine? Must I not shrink while fate the die is throwing, To think how deep, how dear a stake is mine? X I must, I do! for I must still remember How my torn heart his friendship strove to cure; How in that heart where all was cold December, He promised Spring, and cheer'd me to endure. XI With mild remonstrance gentlest pity blending, Full oft his converse cool'd my fever'd mind; He saw despair and love my bosom rending,— Saw that I needed kindness, and was kind. XII While life was in its morn, our souls' communion That bond no time or change can break began; Form'd by the youth's free choice, our social union Gain'd strength from years, and ripen'd with the man. XIII Like him, the world for me contains no other,— To me, no other e'er so dear can be; He is my second self—my friend—my brother, And losing him, mankind is lost to me. XIV Lose him!—Be still, my heart, nor own thou fearest For Edward's sake the issue of this strife: God is too good, too kind, to break the dearest Of those few ties which bind me still to life. XV God will not lift his hand so deep to wound me, Nor see a heart that loves him sue in vain; God will have mercy—on that faith I ground me, Nor doubt, my Edward, we shall meet again. XVI But, lo! day's feeble gleams expiring languish, Eve's deepest shades the world of waters dim; Enthusiast, cease! nor waste in fruitless anguish Those few dear hours you still may pass with him. XVII Go—at the festive board, with Edward seated, Once more the social meal together share; To-night once more be time with converse cheated, And sooth'd by friendship's actions, friendship's care. XVIII Then, with to-morrow's dawn, on board attend him, Sigh as he mounts the vessel's side, “adieu!” Breathe a loud prayer that Heaven may still befriend him, And bid him sometimes bend a thought on you! DANAË. (Imitated from the Greek of Simonides.) I Night, on horror's wing suspended, Veil'd in clouds the watery world; Darkening storms, by fate attended, Through the air their terror hurl'd. II Loud was heard the tempest blowing, High was borne the brazen chest; When the fair, with eyes o'erflowing, Wept upon her infant's breast. III “Babe,” she said, “my fears confound me; Babe,” she said, “for you I fear; I should scorn the floods around me, Did not you their fury share. IV “That thy breast to fear a stranger, Sleeps whilst torrents round thee pour, Thou, dear boy, art blind to danger, Thou art deaf to Nature's roar. V “By thine innocence protected, Thou canst sleep from terror free; Whilst thy mother's soul, distracted, Wakes to horror—wakes to thee! VI “Knew'st thou in what fears I languish,— Knew'st thou what affrights my soul, Tears of sorrow, tears of anguish, Down those little cheeks would roll. VII “Then no longer sportive pleasure Round your rosy lips would play; Grief would seize my little treasure, Grief would steal his smiles away. VIII “Wake not then, dear boy; let slumber Stop the tears and hush the groan; 'Tis thy woes my heart encumber, 'Tis thy danger—not my own. IX “Sleep, my babe; thy mother pillows On her breast thy cheek of snow: Sleep, my babe; and sleep, ye billows,— Sleep, and with ye sleep my woe!” LINES, Written abroad, in answer to a Note addressed ‘au Juif Errant.’ I By fate for ever doom'd to mourn, Through many a clime his feet have borne Your wretched, wandering Jew. Yet should I search the world around, My heart would own it never found A friend it loved like you! II Full oft, with many a bitter sigh, Erst I implored the boon to die; But now, with feelings new, Though large my share of human woes, Unwilling would my eyelids close, And grieve to shut out you. BOUTS RIMES. Filled up at Lady Douglas's request. I Round Edmund's tomb to wreathe these simple flowers, With reverend feet I press the chapel's floor, Rejected love with sorrow mark'd his hours, Health fled his arms, and fortune scorn'd his door. II With weary steps he trod life's painful stage, Each comfort shunn'd him, and each hope proved vain; At length his spirit burst its mortal cage, And then first knew a moment free from pain. III Now spent his malice, Fate unbends his bow, For grief yon narrow cell affords no room: Oh! that I soon may lay my head so low, And since I share his sufferings, share his doom! LULLABY. Intended to have been introduced by Mrs. Jordan, as “Cora,” in the play of Pizarro. I Soft are thy slumbers, soft and sweet;— Oh! when shall my eyes slumbers greet? Ah, me! he stirs—that rickling tear Fell on his cheek, and woke my dear. Hush thee! hush thee! hush thee, boy! Let not my tears thy sleep destroy! II Smiles of content thy cheeks adorn,— When shall such smiles by mine be worn? Ah, me! he cries—that sigh which broke From my full heart, my darling woke. Hush thee! hush thee! hush thee, boy! Let not my sighs thy sleep destroy! SONG, Intended to have been sung in the fourth act of the Castle Spectre. I Oh! sad was my bosom by force when removed From all those who loved me, from all whom I loved! My heart almost breaking, despair in my look, The groves where my childhood had past I forsook; And said while I sigh'd, that my pleasures were o'er, “Farewell, ye dear scenes, I shall see you no more!” II But vain were the fears which my bosom dismay'd: His purple wings flying, Love speeds to my aid; He soothes me—he cheers me—he loosens my chains, And bids me return to my dear native plains. Then hush thee, my heart, for thy sorrows are o'er, And pleasure shall soon be thy inmate once more! THE HORSE-GUARD'S PENELOPE. I And is the news true? are the Guards coming over? And may I soon hope my dear Will to embrace? Once more shall I clasp to my heart the loved rover, And press my fond lips to his bonny brown face? Again shall he pace the parade, firm and steady, And toast me at night in a bumper of gin? Gad-zookers! this news is so rare, that I'm ready, Dear Jenny, with joy to jump out of my skin! II The fruits of his dangers he'll give me with pleasure; I shall soon be rigged out all flashy and new; For sure in the wars he'll have scraped up much treasure, And come back as rich as a king or a Jew! Yet should he come poor, as he went, so he's willing And ready with me and my failings to bear, May this punch be my poison, if, while I've a shilling, My Will be not welcome that shilling to share! III Well, Jenny, these tidings have made me light-hearted, So here goes—“The health of the lad I adore!” May he ne'er again suffer, as when we last parted At Greenwich, and thought we should never meet more! May he ne'er lose that fondness I take such delight in, And ne'er to another that fondness extend; And ne'er may he guess that the while he was fighting, His place in my heart was kept warm by a friend! LINES Written in “Bouhour's Art de Bien Penser.” Presented to a friend. When to my Charles this book I send, A useless present I bestow; Why should you learn by art, my friend, What you so well by nature know? Yet read the book;—haply some spell May in its pages treasured be; Perchance, the art of thinking well May teach you to think well of me! A MATRIMONIAL DUET. These trifles were written at Inverary Castle, for the MS. periodical called “The Bugle,” of which we have elsewhere spoken. Lady Termagant. Step in, pray Sir Toby, my picture is here,— Do you think that 'tis like? does it strike you? Sir Toby. Why, it does not as yet; but I fancy, my dear, In a moment it will—'tis so like you! ON FRIENDSHIP. Calm Friendship, to thine arms I'd fly,— On thee alone for bliss rely, Could I but calm my bosom's thrill, Which whispers “Love is sweeter still.” ADVERTISEMENT. On the 5th of July, on the night of a Monday, Eloped from her husband, the wife of John Gundy; His grief for her absence each day growing deeper, Should any one find her, he begs him to—keep her. CHARADE. I write charades! Now, I'll be curst, If I don't think they'll prove my first; My second, if my friends say right, Is what I do from morn till night; But I my whole can never do, Amanda, when I speak of you! LINES For the Collar of a Dog, belonging to Lady Charlotte Campbell. Stranger! if other dogs beguile Me from my mistress fair to stray, Restore me;—she'll vouchsafe a smile, Which might e'en Avarice repay! PARODY ON THE FIRST ODE OF ANACREON I I'd sing ye “Molly Gramachree,” Soft music through the room to scatter; Or “Water parted from the Sea,” But somehow still it's “Stony Batter!” II I change my bow, and change each string, Now make it sharp—then make it flatter; But when of something else I'd sing, My fiddle still plays “Stony Batter.” III Be “Gramachree,” then, far away! Not one kind glance will I throw at her; But “Stony Batter” still I'll play,— I know no tune like “Stony Batter!” THE ENGLISH KINGS. From St. Evremond. To Charles the First your conduct shows, Britons, like that which Harry, Eighth of the name, observed to those It pleased his grace to marry: First you adored your king, your friend, Whom nought but good was said of; Then you grew jealous, and to end The joke, you cut his head off! BILL JONES. Appended to the MS. from which the following has been copied, we find this memorandum in the author's handwriting: “The wild and singular story upon which this ballad is founded, was first related to me by my friend, Mr. Walter Scott, to whom I was indebted for the following particulars. Every thing which falls from the pen of the author of ‘Marmion,’ and the ‘Lay of the Last Minstrel,’ must, I am certain, be read with interest by the public. “July, 1808. M. G. Lewis.” Then follows the story, as related by Sir Walter, the substance of which we have given in our notice of “Romantic Tales.” “Now, well-a-day!” the sailor said, “Some danger doth impend: Three ravens sit in yonder glade, And harm will happen, I'm sore afraid, Ere we reach our journey's end.” “And what have the ravens with us to do? Does their sight then bode us evil?” “Why, to find one raven 'tis lucky, 'tis true; But 'tis certain misfortune to light on two, And meeting with three is the devil. “I've known full three score years go by, And only twice before I've seen three ravens near me fly; And twice good cause to wish had I, That I ne'er might see them more. “The first time I was wreck'd at sea; The second time, by fire I lost my wife and children three That selfsame night; and woe is me That I did not then expire! “Still do I hear their screams for aid, Which to give was past man's power: I saw in earth their coffins laid,— Well, my heart of marble must be made, Since it did not break that hour!” “Poor soul! your tale of many woes Brings tears into my eyes: But think you, then, such ills arose Because you saw your fancied foes, Three ravens, near you rise? “No doubt, since this fantastic fear Has thus possess'd your head, You firmly believe that ghosts appear, And that dead men rise from their blood-stain'd bier, To haunt the murderer's bed.” “Believe it, master! well I may! Now mark what I relate; For Gospel-true are the words I say, When I swear, that, during three weeks and a day, A Ghost was my own shipmate. “My cash run low—no beef, no flip, And times were hard to live; So I e'en resolved to make a trip For slaves, on board a Guinea ship, Which crime may God forgive! “Oh, 'twas a sad, sad thing to hear The negroes scream and groan, And curse the billows which bore them near To the tyrant white-man's land of fear, And far, far away from their own! “But soon the sailor found his part Scarce better than the slaves; For our captain had a tiger's heart, And he plagued his crew with such barbarous art, We all wish'd us in our graves. “We scarce were two days' sail from port, Ere many a back was flay'd; He flogg'd us oft in wanton sport; His heart was of stone, not flesh—in short, He was fit for such a trade. “Though each in turn was treated ill, 'Mongst all the crew alone Bill Jones opposed our tyrant's will; For Bill was cross and old, and still He'd give him back his own. “And many a brutal harsh command Old Bill had grumbled at; Till once he was order'd a sail to hand, When Bill was so weak he scarce could stand, But the captain scoff'd at that. “For a lazy old brute, poor Bill he abused, And forced him aloft to go; But their duty to do his limbs refused, And at length from the ropes his hands Bill loosed, And he fell on the deck below. “Towards him straight the captain flew, Crying, ‘Dog! dost serve me so?’ And with devilish spite his sword he drew, And ran Bill Jones quite through and through; And the blow was a mortal blow. “At the point of death poor Bill now lies, And stains the deck with gore; And fixing his own on his murderer's eyes, ‘Captain! alive or dead,’ he cries, ‘I ne'er will leave you more!’ “‘You wont?’ says the captain: ‘time will show If you keep your word or not; For now in the negro kettle below, Old dog! your scoundrel limbs I'll throw, And I'll see what fat you've got.’ “So he caused the cook to make water hot, And the corpse, both flesh and bones, (To see what fat Bill Jones had got) The captain boil'd in the negro pot, But there was not much fat in Jones. “If well his word the captain kept, Bill Jones kept his as well; For just at midnight, all who slept, With one consent, from their hammocks leapt, Roused by a dreadful yell. “Never was heard a more terrible sound: Fast to the deck we hied, And there, by the moonbeam's light, we found The murder'd man, in spite of his wound, Sitting close to the steersman's side. “And from that hour, among the rest Bill served, nor left us more; With bloody trousers, bloody vest, And bloody shirt, and bloody breast, Still he stood our eyes before. “And he'd clean the deck, or fill the pail, Or he'd work with right good will To stop a leak, or drive a nail; But whenever the business was handing a sail, Then 'specially ready was Bill. “And to share in all things with the crew Did the spectre never miss; And when to the cook, for his portion due, Each sailor went, Bill Jones went too, And tender'd his platter for his. “His face look'd pale, his limbs seem'd weak, His footsteps fell so still, That to hear their sound you'd vainly seek; And to none of the crew did Bill e'er speak, And none of us spoke to Bill. “But when three weeks had crept away, As you just now have heard, The captain came upon deck one day, And quoth he “My lads, I've something to say; Bill Jones is as good as his word. “‘He never leaves me day nor night, He haunts me—haunts me still; By the midnight lamp I see the spright, And when at morn the sky grows light, The first sunbeam shows me Bill. “‘At meals, his pale lips speak the grace, His cold hand gives me wine; At every hour, in every place, To whatever side I turn my face, Bill's eyes are fix'd on mine. “‘Now, lads, my resolution's made, One means will set me free, And Bill's pursuit for ever evade. He comes—he comes! Then, away!’ he said, And plunged into the sea. “None moved a joint the wretch to save, All stood with staring eyes; Each clasp'd his hand—a groan each gave, When, lo! on a sudden, above the wave, Once more did the captain rise. “Fix'd and fearful was his eye, And pale as a corpse his brow, And we saw him clasp his hands on high, And we heard him scream with a terrible cry, ‘By God! Bill's with me now!’ “Then down he sunk through the foaming flood To hell, that worst of havens! Now Heaven preserve you, master good, From perilous rage and innocent blood, And from meeting with three ravens!”</field>
