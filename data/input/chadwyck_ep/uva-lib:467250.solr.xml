      <field name="fulltext">Metrical Sketches. THE NYMPHS' LAMENT FOR THE TITANS. Might of the earth-born, Where art thou fallen? Craft of the noblest, Why hast thou failed?— Fallen the earth-born Titans when all nature Moaned in the new supremacy of Zeus! And a disdainful Atè-vengeance Floated about his halls, On to the amber tables Of the Elysians, Above the cloud-rack! But they sat and shuddered; Yet she came not 'Mid the soft-bosomed meadows Where the heroes Repose eternally! First-born of Cronos, Thou may'st deck thy Heavens In rainbows! Bid the scented Asphodel Feign a wan summer, where no winter enters— But give us Earth, Earth, real, plenteous, Imperfect, dying, bounteous, Ever renewed! Far from the tyrannous all-consuming glory Of haughty Zeus The God-absorbing God, Essential and predominant. Give us Earth!—Love! Love tho' a mortal one, and hand in hand We will tread pleasant pastures, and out-myriad The stars with tender vows! And syllable most fervent oaths Fraught with our deepest energy and life— That may not last one moon out? And our hot kisses Shall be as revelations Of something which perfection cannot give, Earth-savouring, earth-imperfect; Yet to us Worth all the sameness of a stale Olympus. Nothing is eternal but sensation. Zeus cannot touch it, elder, more original, Than his new generation.— Look deep into mine eyes; wert thou a God I could not love thee more, my mortal lover. Be with me always! I ask no more; be with me, 'tis enough. We are but motes in destiny, Atoms of one transcendent whole, Unoriginated! and our joys Are to our natures woof and web! Endless undistinguishable threadings In an interminable Maze of being. And in the soul of each There rests a law, Dark yet untransgressible. That winds us on the distaff of necessity, Or binds us in the whirl-dance of our destiny;— While to our thirsty beings, Fainting, despondent, Love's imperial chalice, The deep grace-cup of forever, Freshens unfailing. Existence ends, When love is sped, Annihilation waits us! THE CONVENT LOVE. God well knoweth how I love thee! Pale one, hid in convent walls Where the lindens wave above thee, While their withered blossom falls! God well knoweth, how forsaken, Nightly doth my heart awaken, When the midnight chimes are wafted, Slowly, drearily, are wafted, From the gleaming convent walls! When thy midnight hymns arise, Creeps a whisper o'er the trees; Mingling ever, with my sighs, On the moaning of the breeze: Then, God knoweth, how forsaken To my anguish I awaken, When the long slow mass is chanted, By a form my soul is haunted, Veiled and on its knees. Saintlike one! with thoughts of heaven Written o'er thy perfect mind; Pray! for peace to thee is given, That I too some rest may find. Pray that I, the all-forsaken, From that rest may ne'er awaken, Death the prayed for! sadly wanted, I will greet thee, nothing daunted, As a mother kind! Hark, how sad a dove complains, From her convent linden's nest, Now no little one remains Warm against her brooding breast,— Of her fledglings reft, forsaken, Her doth also sorrow waken, And like mine her useless wailing, To the heedless wind complaining, Is in vain addressed! Dashed against yon turrets hoar, Birdling, from thy nested height! And my love returns no more, Deep immured in convent night; Till one morn she shall awaken, From this world of sorrow taken, Where the strains of heaven are wafted, Fair beyond all thought are wafted, Borne by angel-flight! THE EAGLE RING. There came an eagle soaring towards the sea, Above the palace of an ancient king; He spied a princess fair as fair could be, And from his talons cast a diamond ring. The princess stooped, and found the costly prize, That on her finger day by day she wore; And it reflected back her glorious eyes, And made their brilliants sparkle tenfold more. Till as the years rolled round and she must wed, Ere she of summers twice had numbered eight; Proud kings, and princes of high sovereigns bred, Rode knight-attended to her palace gate. A youth behind came mounted all alone, Upon a charger white, in mean attire; Across his brow the clustered ringlets shone, Beneath them flashed an eagle glance of fire. The princess passed through all that grand array, Nor heeded king, or him of monarch born; She saw the humble knight that stood away,— She flushed as rosy as an April morn. As towards that unknown youth she bent aside, Through April tears her eyes of lustre shine: “Sir Knight, if thou wilt have me for thy bride, Poor as thou art, my fate is surely thine.” Spake forth the king in wrath unto his child:— “Bid this thy chosen one disclose his name. A girlish phantasy, by love beguiled, Will bring our ancient lineage down to shame.” “A fairy prince,—no low-born wanderer I; Bright are my islands of the western sea: Of gorgeous visions, and unclouded sky, Thy home, my love, if thou wilt come with me! “I wed thee with this ring of jewels rare, And thou like this another ring canst show; For we have been betrothed since thou didst wear That other ring I sent thee long ago.” THE RAIN-NYMPHS' SONG. Merry days of summer ye are ended, And the lark forgets to trill his song. Mist and cloud o'er heaven's gray arch are blended, No blue skies as when the spring is young. Mournful winds are carolling their numbers, And the year has worn herself away With the nurture of ungrateful children, Recking little of her near decay. Then the ilex answers to the elm-tree Asking shelter from the northern blast, “Ye are but poor flimsy gauds of sunshine, Ye must chill when your gay sun is past. I and Daphne are of hardier courage, Fair or foul can seldom come amiss. Whether stillest breath of timorous breezes, Or bluff Boreas dash a sturdy kiss.” Rain and mist and overflooded river, Weave the measure of our Hyad dance, And the myriad starlights o'er us quiver, As the gleaming spheres of Heaven advance. Shower and cloud, and alternative brightness, Mantling under our aërial train; As with footsteps of eternal lightness, Chide we on the slowly hinging wain. Daughters seven of Atlas! purest ether Melts away at our ambrosial eyes; Fades the sunshine from the cloudless weather, At our beck the glorious tempests rise. EROS AND PSYCHE. Psyche slumbered in a golden garden, Eros watched her sleep with tender care, Suffering not the sun to kiss her forehead, Nor the breeze to stir her amber hair. Purest visions of delight and beauty Gave he, rainbow tissues, dazzling beams; Still contriving that his own bright image Should arise in her enchanted dreams. And she sleeps, while each succeeding wonder All her trancèd spirit thrills and charms. When at length they fade, her eyes she opens, With a sigh of bliss in Eros' arms. Sees her Eros' smile, and feels his kisses Countless as the drifted winter's flakes, Thinks her dreams poor shadows, faint reflections, Of the happiness to which she wakes. SONG OF THE GRACES. One even course of rule and right; Clear virtue's beauty clean from flaw; The staid proportion of a life That hinges by one steadfast law; All joys unfevered by regret, A goading itch for change unblest, Or fierce desire, whose aching fret Drains passion dregs of deep unrest! O'er that which seeks another's good, Pure self-denial, prideless, true, Whose glories hardly understood, Lie veiled to grosser mortals' view. O'er these we reign, and graceful duty, The balanced heart, the equal mind, Refining with their inward beauty The social life of all mankind; The hearth, and household joys and cares, The circle of a peaceful home; With gentle love that often wears A semblance of high things to come; Music and arts, the gift of song; We temper each in each degree; Naked and bare, unknowing wrong, Fast linked together, sisters three. Nor fear the venom'd slander sting In our vast innocence secure; We touch with gold each homely thing, Well-workers undisguised and pure! AGAMEMNON. In tedious siege and ineffectual strife, In waste of hero-blood, and aimless broil, Ten weary years have dragged their laggard life, 'Till treachery sapped the walls that baffled toil, And warrior strength and warrior deeds did foil. 'Till from its base great Ilium's citadel Encompassed by a triple line of spears And shoaling angered Greeks, in ruins fell, To rise no more hereafter thro' long years— To mock our long-haired kings—to move our nations' fears! Ten years! great portion of our narrowed days, Frittered beside the canvas-crowded shore: Battling for empty glory, emptier praise; In bitter yearnings for the homeward oar, My lonely queen, the Argive mountains hoar; I've left me now of life a span-like score! At length Troy is no more. The fatal sheen Of Spartan Helen's love-ensnaring glance, Made deadlier far one faithless lady's eyne Than barb of arrow or the poise of lance— Battered were breastplates, riven their lordly helms. She sorrow brought and death to Priam's realms. For foemen's greedy hands and eddying fire Fiercer than vengeance tear thy walls away, Of craft immortal girt with tower and spire, And raze of temples all that long array; Nor reverence what time could not decay! A heap of ruins shall we leave behind— Alas, my heart is clouded o'er with care, That when we are returned we too may find, Instead of home, a heap of ruins there!— No home but desolation and despair. A heap of ruins perhaps our wife's affection,— Our children's love with absence chilled and fled; Fair looks and smiles will gloss their deep dejection, Who counted us long time among the dead— Long time have dried what scanty tears they shed. Folly of follies, on a brother's wrong To waste the marrow of our days in war,— To stretch thin hands, and hymn a wretched song For peace,—a treacherous vapour-broadened star, Whose beams strike near us, yet its orb is far. Ye mists, that shroud our future and our lives, Roll out your cloudy secrets, crush with fire The dread unsounded destiny which strives To hold us from the lips we most desire. Home is most homeless chilled with welcome stern. What if I've stayed too long, too late return? REMORSE. Thou hauntest me, pale face and tearful eyes, In stillest night! Remorse is written on the darkened wall, In characters of light. I hear a shriek in silence dead, That breaks my rest; A mighty horror drifting o'er my head, Wrong unconfessed! The cry is but the note and strain Of the wild swan southwards wending; But it comes to me as a cry of pain, Of some one dying, ending, Again, and yet again! Thou hauntest me, pale face and tearful eyes,— Thy white frock labours—labours,— With thy dumb, unuttered sighs! Thy coronal of flowers is dewed with weeping! On thy white robe is there no stain? On thy pale brow is there no pain, That mars my sleeping? THE ANCIENT MINSTREL. How much is to be done! how few the arms! How few the lances! Fortress, fosse and tower, Gird in the wrong that spoils the peaceful bower, And robs the maiden's charms! Fair chivalry and knighthood are but specks, Beacons faint glimmering in a night-spread land! Ah! happy champion, he who forth shall stand, To bruise of wrong the hundred Hydra necks! Upon the battlements the captive maiden Looks out on distance: “Will no hero come? No sound of horn or hoof?” The woods are dumb! Are dumb—and her poor heart with care o'erladen! How many loving hearts, what great reward, Lie stored for thee, O knight of laurelled brow! Ah! who would rein or rowel slacken now, Till he return thus crowned, thus honor-scarred? Of listless wintered age a shattered weight, My idle song enrolls a deathless fate. Oh, give me, youth, thy nervèd arm and lance, The fire, fame's glowing herald, in thy glance— And I will do some miracle of praise! LOVE IN SOLITUDE. And she shall be my love, whose quiet eyes Speak tender messages of dear affection. A sunbeam glance, like sunset ere it dies Casts on an evening mere in still reflexion. And she shall sway my heart, whose pensive brow Holds with the inner world a blest communion; Whose tresses waving round her neck of snow, Blend dark and auburn in a happy union. A saintlike innocence untouched, unseared By sad experience and the jars of life. A flower in some secluded garden reared, Beyond the world and its disheartening strife. There shall be magic in her joyous laugh, Like careless childhood's; through her virgin tears Shall break the mellow sunshine of a heart Unhardened by the disenchanting years. And we will seek us out a calm retreat, Among the woodbine of a happy vale; Our cot shall lie where gushing streamlets meet, And odorous flowers the garden trellis scale. As morning, silver on the shore and wold, Flickers in iron-sided hills away, For us shall ride in oriel fields of gold Pearl-crested clouds of undulating day. There may our lives flow on in still delight, The holy fruit of sweet contentment reaping; There, when our earthly dreamland fades to night, Under the self-same sod may we lie sleeping. THE FIRST EVENING OF A KNIGHT ERRANT'S QUEST. Ah! whither ridest thou, young knight, so late? The warder that unbarr'd thy castle gate, The sire that blest thee and embraced thee going, Have sent thee forth to blind, unfathomed fate, Thee all unknowing! Guess not, fear not, hope always and ride on! Ride on, till morning through the pinewood gleams! As fair as is the morning of thy dreams, Ah, keep thy soul, a mirror pure as heaven; Rest sits afar with Hope near amber streams, Till thou hast striven— Try well—fear not—seek ever and ride on! And when thy courage shall wax faint and fail, When shining turrets seem too hard to scale, Thine enterprize now possible no longer! Then may this watchword brace thy limbs of mail, And make thee stronger— “To try and fear not—tire not, but go on.” FIRST LOVE. There is a mound that rises near my home, And looks on happy pastures far away To where the eye can reach a distant dome, Catching the first beam of the golden day. There dwelt my first love. Thus in boyhood's sky, Some radiant lodestar's tremulous orb appears; And choicest minstrel art in vain would try To sing the beauty of her tender years. Here standing, I would fancy, love beguiled, I saw her kerchief flutter from the tower; Then at my folly I half angry smiled, Yet still kept gazing on my lady's bower. Short seemed that distance, as I daily strode Through scented lanes and silvery birchen grove: Short would have been ten times as long a road,— Distance is nothing to the wings of love! And how will look the roadside flowered thorn, The blooming fern-grown hedge, the taper pine, How will they look, I wondered, on that morn When I shall pass to ask her to be mine? And then, I thought, if fruitless breath my prayer, The precious may-buds would delay their bloom! But if she loved me, sunshine wondrous rare Would flood the ordered pinewood's inmost gloom. The stealing years have left me still that mound: There, youth's dear fancies gild my memory grey. I watch yon sun the self-same journey bound, Shed on my lost Love's home his earliest ray. ROMULUS. Builder's shout and workman's hammer, Mason's chisel, joiner's strife,— Thus, 'mid ever-varying clamour, Springs the new-born town to life. Cranes, with strength of fabled dragons, Lift the blocks of clean white stone: Creaks the timber in the waggons, With a forest's windy moan. Here shall rise, in after ages, Temple, terraced lawn and tower; And through Heaven-appointed stages, Rome shall grow in fame and power. Brother! would the gods but give thee Eyes to see the future town,— Brother! sure thou wouldst forgive me That sad blow that struck thee down. Brother! shall thine angry spectre, Plotting ill to infant Rome, Leave ambrosial feast, and nectar,— Leave the heroes' starry home? Shall not ages of repentance Give thy tortured manes rest? Must thy furies fix, in sentence, Vulture talons at my breast? Surely as the gods had fated, Wove the sisters three thy fall: Here twain monarchs had created Anarchy that marreth all. Who can stem the wintry Tiber! Who can lull the wintry breeze? Frail all human strength and fibre, When opposed to Jove's decrees. First of gods, primeval Saturn, On his new-born offspring preys; Legend quaint, of antique pattern,— Meaning, Time begets, but slays. Time must come, when death must vanquish, Little reck we how we go,— Whether by disease, long anguish, Or some quick and fatal blow, Men will link our names together, Authors of this great design, Thou hast rest and cloudless weather; But a stormcast life is mine,— Toiling till my head grow hoary, Thick beset by jealous foes. Brother! thine is half the glory,— How I envy thy repose! REVEILLÉ. Arise, arise, why linger here? The lark is singing to the morn; The summer day shows brighter cheer, Because it had a cloudy dawn. The sullen vapour 'gainst the sun Disputes from tree to tree his ground, A hundred echoes mock the gun Of forester on early round. Dearest, let us walk together, Out into the glorious morn; Roses love this balmy weather, Gossamer decks out the thorn; Heavy rosebuds seem to listen, They shall lend you blushes, sweet! And the gossamer shall glisten, Diamonds, round your fairy feet. Listen to the water falling Down yon cascade's rocky track; With a torrent music calling Its pale rainbow's colour back! Now a hoarser strain has risen, With the whirl of pinions blent, Where on oak by lightning riven Starlings hold their parliament. Forward then! the woods are gay— Who at home in May would bide! Daffodils come out in May, May, of months the lover's pride! Forward! while the sun may shine! Forward! while the skies are blue! Winter comes—and Lady mine, Life will have its winter too! AGNES. O thou hast mourned enough, and more than measure, In thy despair! Rivers of weeping call not back thy treasure, Nor floods of prayer Save thee no tress of all her golden hair! Be patient and put on A cheerful mask; Brace firm thy will,— And soon the sense of ill Will lighten in the task. Nature, you tell me, doth herself renew, And grief wears out as wound or hurt will do; Still must the scar remain! Nature renews the flowers each spring,— The self-same flower she cannot bring To life again. One blossom flowereth not two separate years; The death of winter changeth all—and fears Have I, that never through that long hereafter May come my love's bright smile, or happy laughter,— That lives but in the past, or in my dreams, As faded sunset hangs in night its gleams. Fate's rigour chill'd the marble of thy breast, Love's tragedy hath snapt the crystal thread, And sealed for an inevitable rest The gracious lips to silence forfeited. If love be tears, if life an endless pain, Annihilation is the fairer gain! THE FORSAKEN SHEPHERDESS. Linus, my love, is flown, My flocks are shepherdless—my ewes untended! I'll weep! and weep alone, Linus, whose form with that of Gods contended, Linus, whose grace half envying Heaven offended, Hath left me here to weep. Woe, woe! my garland fair Is withered with unkindness, winter-blighted; Once fostered with sweet air, That was his smile wherein I most delighted, A radiant light-flood on my soul benighted! My garland was his love! Ye lank and breeze-vext rushes, Have ye not heard him wooing me his bride? The streamlet answering hushes The murmur of its gently-wavering tide, That quivering chides its osier-bedded side, “We heard his perjury.” Thou art a faithful stream, Lovingly close past yonder islet wound Thy tide with ripple-gleam Doth bend two thin white arms to clasp it round, Hast ever heard Silenus' woven song, Whisper a guileless nymph to scath and wrong, Making love—Perjury? Shine out clear stars of heaven On this unholy earth from purer sky: Where man may be forgiven Must maidens suffer for their love and die? Nor Heaven regard their unavailing cry— Die! but men heed them not. O circling wondrous time, That sparest nothing through this earth created O surely for each crime Thou hast in store some retribution fated; Thou hast some term for sorrow never sated: Kill, or restore my love! “NUNC EST BIBENDUM.” Comrades! let us crown our cups with roses! Brothers! fill we draughts of costly wine! Night star-glorious comes, now day reposes, Lulled to rest beyond the Western brine. Liquid rubies in the crystal beaker Noble alchemies of virtue rare, Where the wine-god gives to every seeker Freedom from the stings of pain and care. Wavering rubies, like the sun at even, Back reflected through some oriel pane, Rays whose gold and carmine pass from heaven, Fade as years that ne'er shall come again. Years are ambushed on our fairest treasures, Watchful months an ivoried forehead blight: Life is short—and so, to livelier measures Drain the wine-cup e'er we pass to Night! EARLY SPRING. Half spring, half winter, I know not which! As a ripe sun wakes, Where the rubied flakes Have rifted the clouds asunder; And bathed in his beams, Like a palace of dreams, Or a castle of fairy wonder, Is the yellow-moated tower. And flash and shadow alternately play On lichened turret and buttress grey, Of that ruin grim and olden; While the waves may laugh on the shining sands, And the wavelets play with the amber sands, In the sun-ray pure and golden! And our old dull sea has donned to day the deeper blue of a Southern sky, Unmeet, while the swallows are still away, Keeping their winter holiday, In lands where winter is summer! Endless summer! the whole year round, Old Winter comes not thither— From there we may laugh at his crispy locks, Where icicle-crusted he sits on his rocks, Much the worse for wind and weather. OPHELIA. Beckoning ever, beckoning me, Past the silver-girdled lea, And orchards lined with willow tree,— The river flows so silently. From a sheet of bounteous tide, Flashing answer low replied, “They who lost their hope have died.” The river glides most peacefully. Death is peace, but life unrest. Heaven must come and Heaven is best. Fold me slumber of the blest! Wearied birds must seek their nest. The river runs enticingly. A HYMN OF PEACE. They come! and maidens fair as morning blushes, Before them, as they pass, are scattering flowers; While our imperial ensign proudly flushes, All gold and crimson, from the minster towers. Conquest they bring, and, greater, holier blessing, Peace, meed of saints, and dower of heaven above. At her charm'd name each father is caressing, With tears of joy, the offspring of his love. Dear crown of conquests hasten, Peace, to save us? Grateful, as music heard by those in pain, Sweet, as the kisses that our first love gave us, Or breath of woodbine after summer rain! Peace, thou returnest like those bells soft pealing! Peace, new-found guest, stay on through countless time. May nought disturb our land's harmonious future, Nor mar the golden years' melodious chime! THE SONG OF ALCIDES. I will sing the peerless Hero, Sprung from sad Alcmena's pain, Godlike o'er whose ample shoulders Flows Nemea's lion-mane. Great Alcides! lordly victor Over death supreme and shame; Safe escaped to restful nectar, From the venom'd mantle's flame. Æta's summits mist-enshrouded Loom between the sunrise pale; Now the eye of heaven is clouded, Peals an everlasting wail. But the Demigod has vanished, Heavenward past on thunder-swell; Whom long banished, silver-chaliced Hebe waits 'mid asphodel. Fairer than Hesperian wonder, Heavenly fruitage, amber streams: Virgin skies unseared by thunder, Flooded with ambrosial gleams. Holy virtue, hard and painful, When we faint beneath thy load; In thy sequel grandly gainful, Crowned with Heaven thine upward road! Snake-like vices to deceive us Lurk our very cradles nigh: Wrestle with them—and they leave us! Crush them!—and the Typhons die! ON A MOUNTAIN. Pine-woods blue that clothe the mountain, Sunbeams pierce not oft your shade! Bilberries guard each fern-grown fountain, With its miniature cascade, Where, through moss thin waves distilling, Trickle on, a runnel filling. Wild the air around me sweeping,— Wild the note the heathcock trills! Wild the snow-fed torrent leaping, In a hundred diamond rills! Here the breath of freedom reaches: Nought but sloth the valley teaches! Here may grow some fairy blossom, Fragile form, of colour rare, Nestled in a snow-flake's bosom, Only born in finest air, Deep among the birk and heather, Little recking wind or weather. Who would live in pent-up valley, Where the sunrise comes but late?— Who in reeking town or alley, Making gold and marring fate, Spoiling life, that comes most pleasant To the humble mountain peasant? THE MINSTREL. A boy has ta'en his harp, and forth has wended, Far from the purple vineyards of his land; Since then long years have rolled them on, and ended, Melted to past by Time's transmuting wand. And while he traversed many a warlike nation, And while he sang in many a lordly hall, He told of lofty hope and aspiration,— He tuned his lays to valour one and all. He taught of nature's high and noble fancies, No slothful visions of a gilded dream, Mere empty raptures of the bard's romances, But as of erring lives the guides supreme. And next he sung how earthly love and beauty, For vain delights to mortals never given, Were watchwords for the soldier in his duty,— Fair beacons on that upward road towards heaven. As thus he wanders on, his heart rejoices, Although at times he feels some homesick pain,— Longs for his vineyards—hears those well-known voices, That, save in dreams, he never heard again. Still sang he, till his strength and vigour faded,— Till gently sped his soul away at last: And with one sigh for his beloved country, He died—and to a fairer country passed! MEMNON. Mother! I am pining for thy comfort: Mother! long and dreary is thine absence. Night the hateful lingers on in heaven. Insupportable this treble darkness, Tangible, and awful, horror-freighted! Will not one smile of thy radiant coming, Or the first flush of thy rosy presence, Ever gladden more my wearied eyelids? Dark! how dark across the eastern desert, Yet no tiny thread of light to cheer me,— Red of morning none to streak the cloud-line! Numb in crusted rock my drowsy nature, Throbs more genial pulses at thine advent, Rapturous expands in thrilling music! Notes of praise melodious, love-enkindled, Strains of thankfulness a heavenward incense, As the lark bids greeting to the sunrise; Or the vocal choristers of morning Anthem out her praise in middle ether! Wouldst thou only gleam, O lordly river, But thy ripples move not in the moonbeam: Day would flood with light thy silver courses; Dawn would flicker haloes o'er thy waters, Towards the fountains of thy folded rising, Leagues away beyond the desert southwards; Whence the hot breeze weeps above thy sedges, By thy palm-rank'd, temple-clustered margin; Where I once was king of Æthiopia, Lord whilom supreme of swarthy nations, Ebon-haired, and children of the marshes, Dreadful archers, bronzed by neighbouring Phœbus. These I led away to fated Ilium, Fated for the wrong of graceful Paris. There Achilles challenged forth and slew me, For I scorned to meet the aged Nestor, Frail avenger of his son I conquered, Feeble to requite his darling's slaughter! Either host looked on beside our conflict,— All the plain was dense with crested warriors, Morions waved, and flashed a myriad lances. There I fell—and still I hear the clangour Of the mighty armies round me falling,— Hear that shout that swept across the waters, Thunder-voiced upon a vaporous sea-shore, Tossed athwart the bosom of the surges, Echoed onwards till the gusty mountains— Then a mist and darkness closed upon me, And a blank o'ershadowed all my fancy. Yet, dear mother, though thy tears availed not With great Jove to render me immortal, Thou a half existence still hast dowered me, Still of outward nature some perception, Better than the gloom of spectral Hades; And though I may weary here expectant, All these years of watching on the desert, All these nights of solitude and darkness,— Yet how blest a thrill when thou art near me Stirs thy mortal son, worn down with ages, Mother, blooming in eternal beauty! Dear Aurora, with thine hours around thee In thy coronal of early dewdrops, Wafted on thy gloom-dividing chariot, Hasten to thy child as lightnings hasten, Scatter azure night, the cloud-enshrouded, Press upon my brow one kiss of greeting. THE OLD CRUSADER. I take thee down good sword at need, Damascus shalt thou see again; I whisper to my trusty steed That we must cross the main. Go, Seneschal, and tell from me Each liegeman tried that owns my sway, That he who lists may sail with me, And he who lists may stay. Careless of life—a master stern,— I still will take but willing men; For whether one of us return Is past all mortal ken. I ween my stalwart spears who fought In ancient days at Antioch's sack, Would falter now in eastern drought With harness at their back. Their crippled limbs are all unmeet For panoplies of glancing mail, And tho' I keep a lusty heart At times my sinews fail. The ampler night is verging near, To broaden towards the ampler day. My silent life is grey and drear And wherefore should I stay? 'Twere nobler if my scanted hours Ran out, where gleaming fights are won; Why sit among my ruined towers And watch the rounding Sun? My veterans stricken year by year Fade out, and only yestermorn The bell has tolled another dear Old comrade graveward borne. I'd liever lay these rusting bones In fields where blessed footsteps trod, Than in this Castle's tumbling stones Await the hand of God. Our Kaiser's eagle ensigns wave, And beckon for the holy plain; Goes clustering towards the Saviour's grave The youth of Allemagne. Those generous hearts shall be my peers, Their genial energies shall warm The winter of my frosty years, The numbness of my arm. I'll watch their prowess, now, most glad Yet wincing now, a touch of pain, To think how many a gallant lad Old caitiff Death has slain,— Has slain them all, and passed me by, Great spirits pure of shame, But drifts me here to rot and die, And strikes the nobler game. I will not die ere yet I feel The breath of battle on my cheek; Again, where fronted armies reel My clarion's tongue shall speak. Ye blessed fields of Galilee, My wearied spirit's utmost goal; Oh, there, as broken paynims flee May Christ accept my soul. IDA. Thou hast passed from pain and woe, Nought can mar thy quiet rest; Where no winds of winter blow, And where comes no wintry snow! Thou art blest. What if those thou hast relinquished Feel at times disconsolate?— What if life is barren, dreary, And our hearts are very weary! We must wait. Spark of hope yet unextinguished,— Light us through what still remains; If thy scanty lustre fail us, Little shall our strength avail us, Towards the amaranthine plains! THE NAIADES. In the drift of rainbow'd fountains, Where the brook its silver traces, Thro' the campaign rich and fair,— 'Mid the sedges' languid faces, Braided with ambrosial hair, Breeding laughter, love, despair— Mortals may not see our beauty, Lest they die in our embraces. Where the red weed dips and glances, In the dull and deeper pool. One by one the myrtle-berries Shed in dimpled eddies cool. Steps profane, be far away, Here the sister sea-nymphs play. HUNTER'S SONG. Summer changes sere to sheen, Winter's dusk is summer's green, When nightingales trill out between Dainty myrtle bushes. Care till winter cast we by, Time enough when flowers must die, Seldom sullen, while the sky With cloudless sunray flushes. Ill and good gives every hour, Light and shade, or sun and shower; Rathe return of shine and lower Fortune's orbit teaches. Fine to-day—'twere scath and wrong To doubt; mistrusts the linnet's song? Yet summer's swallow flits among The mellow mere-side reaches: Yonder by the white-rose briar Careless birdlings pipe and quire. Shall fear of winter make our lyre One erring chord deliver? When our dole or dance is done, Other harps of fuller tone Sound the lays of ages gone, And save great song for ever! Fate a river broad and wide, Sweeps us all upon its tide; Laughter-freighted will we glide, Not with tears and wail. Nature pleases well our eyes, Fortune merry heart defies, Sad or merry, summer flies, Youth and lustre fail! THE FATED RACE OF TANTALUS. Zeus looked down from his thunder-cloud, And breathed a curse, Deep-voiced and adamantine, Upon the house of Atreus. Horrible doom, ye sons of Tantalus, What shall satisfy the thunderer's vengeance? If unborn children pay prospective sentence, Who may escape? Under the molten crags of Tartarus The sharp-eared furies heard it. With an unearthly discord, Winged them black fates of death O'er our devoted city! Blood—blood—who shall appease The anger of immortals? Infinite And multiplied the troubles they have wrought Upon a harmless people, of whose kings They have torn ample vengeance! Zeus sat firm on the purple hills, And his lightning countenance Out-paled the sun As his flash came bright beyond brightness. The goatherd gathered his flocks in haste; And only the waterfall Fretting the marble rock Found voice or any sound, When the weird hush came after. O, we have watched by hearths With war and famine desolate, Sunken eyes and wasted cheeks, In an eternal sympathy of misery; We have seen rude blood-stained lips, Upon the sacred foreheads of our dear ones, And scarce a groan, and never a curse, Hath angered the fair blue heaven That laughed derision over us! Fated to misery, born into misery, Desolate children of night Tedious are our complainings! Sweep us from this rough earth, Fold us in cold dark earth, We would begone into night! We have known so much woe— Behind what pain remains? Ye then have nought to fear, And death is so much gain. Yet apprehension's sting, Accursed demon-fiend, Contrives to lurk behind In breasts that, most forlorn, Lose last their idiot hopes. Destiny! all is destiny! Shall we sit down and die? Merciful Zeus, let loose thy thunder, Or clear our sullen sky! A SUNSET AT SEA. They who have sailed upon the summer seas, And watched the sun pass grandly down to rest, Feel, on the whisper of the evening breeze, A world of sadness creeping o'er their breasts. A sorrow fathomless, whose inner meaning, Transcends the griefs that strew our earthly way, To show the soul, thro' cloud-lands intervening, All glorious vistas of eternal day. Infinite nature, full of deep devotion! Wonder unceasing—beauty without end! We, who are gazing on the star-wav'd ocean, Hope and adore, but cannot comprehend. DITHYRAMBIC. Bacchus the wineflushed! Youthful and bold, Thou ever bloomest, But we grow old! Never a wrinkle Furrows thy brow; But thine adorers' Locks are of snow. Thy rosy garlands Still keep their thorns; Fiery the forehead Thy vineleaf adorns. Truly thou warmest, But perhaps we may learn, That Jove poor Semele Loved but to burn. A HYMN OF VICTORY. Anthems of victory, hymns of praise, Sing at each altar's steps and shrine! We have prevailed! By help divine Our swords are wreathed with conquering bays. Beat drums, and let the clarion's note Awake the echoes of the town, Responsive to its sons' renown, Who mightily their foemen smote. Beat drums! and let the trumpet's sound Wake echoes in the hearts of men, Wake welcomes from each citizen, For those who come in victory crowned. Now wave our standards at the gate, From every casement peers a face; On pass we to the market-place, 'Mid ermined councillors that wait. Fair maidens scatter roses fast: Upon our helmets favours shower, A riband here, and there a flower, Sweet meed and praise for dangers past. O God, our warrior! to thine arm, Not to our might, be glory given: Else vainly had we fought and striven To save dear Freedom clear from harm. Hark! through the vast cathedral porch, To grand Te Deums swelling loud, In civic pomp the burghers crowd; While priest with censer and with torch, In slow procession, entering, tread Through fretted aisles with rafters high, From which the bursts of psalmody Swell towards the throne of God o'erhead! SOUTHWARDS! The glens are hoary with a winter's snows: No rivulets waft music to the meres; The sombre mountains wear upon their brows The majesty of grey, time-silvered years. The vocal birds are silent on the hill; The voice of insects, nature's myriad lays Winter has hushed; as great enchanters still The wizard chorus of less potent fays. Dear one! our footsteps warmer climes invite,— Breadths of Elysian verdure crown our way; 'Neath happy spheres of cloudless heaven, by night With brighter stars, intenser blue by day. Their memoried times those olive hills outlast. Old echoes haunt the shafted temple's halls, And wreaths of an imperishable past Are woven with the ivies of old walls. There will we rest us by the quiet sea,— There fear no more the winter north-wind drear; The air shall waft us perfume, and the bee Shall murmur, Oh, ye wanderers! peace is here: THE LAMENT OF PHAETON'S SISTERS. Bring ye moly and the short-lived crocus, Burn ye frankincense with odorous cedar, We will strew his sepulchre with roses, A royal tomb! Thou ill-fated, most presumptuous brother! Couldst thou dare ascend the gleaming chariot, Mortal charioteer to guide the sun-steeds? He our father, The unapproachable,— Phœbus, Lord of Delos, Eternally surrounded By the clear glory of his awful presence, Frowned at thy request; Nor yet denied it, For he had sworn By Styx, that oath of dreadful import, That even bindeth fast immortals, To grant thy first boon! Ah ye, our father's horses! Steeds of daylight! Could ye destroy our brother? Hence shall we no more bring you The golden barley, Divine, ambrosial; No more our fingers Shall comb your manes out, Or sleek your proud necks: Ye have betrayed him. Then sped the irresistible Bolt of the great one, Zeus, king eternal, Scorching thy wretched life; And thou wast hurled Out upon space! Three days still falling, Blackened by lightning, Among the stars, Towards the dim earth, In the night of death! Until we found thee Here by the river, Thy beauty scarred, Thy face distorted,— Our love alone had known thee! Here will we lay him In mother Earth, Enswathed in costly cerements; And we sad watchers Will weep long tears,— Upon the crystal river Rain down our tears As thick as amber! And we will sigh As sigh yon poplars by the margin, Above the sedges, That droop their sere leaves,— With these the river Shall moan in unison A dirge for thee, O thou beloved one! Brother, most ill-fated! ON THE COAST. The mellow-throated curlew's call Sobs up a flickering pulse of sound, Silverly distant from a fall Of beach, embanked with shining mound; Where sea and mountain, sand and sky, Mete out the landscape rigidly. The violet clouds in bearing drench Are tumbling in a smoke of rain Against the crystal-white, clear drawn In many a molten jagged stain. Small cresting breakers whiten far Beyond the gleaming ripple-breadths of bar. And a sea-music rises up and moves Upon the aërial mountains to expand By furrowy granite-raftered fastnesses In windy ecstasies, Stern—beautiful. No trace of scheming hand, A virgin nature: and the wild gull sways Poised in the raw shrill-driving ocean sprays, Above the solitary water-caves Scooped by the tongues of very patient waves, In all the infinitely measured years. There is no solitude: around us spread Lies vast companionship pervading all,— The answering woods, the storm-shriek o'er our head, The sympathy of mountain and of fall, A presence of innumerable powers In sunset's gold or breath of summer flowers. “SO RUNS THE WORLD AWAY.” A BALLAD. “Mother, see, 'mid emerald-shadowed larches, Rides a glorious warrior—lordlier none; Surely towards some mighty field he marches And he bears him like a monarch's son. “Proudly steps his stately war-horse, larger Than its race—a gracious, gallant sight; Give me, mother, such another charger, I would with him to the noble fight.” Spake an ancient lady from her needle, “This thou hast in blood and of thy sire, As in eyrie nest the callow eagle Eyes the flocks in hungry, fierce desire.” Spake the mother, “Child, thou askest blindly, Years make ripe too soon thy golden grain,— Ere thou know'st it man, to long as wildly For thy childhood's tender nest again.” “Good and evil in the fatal measure; Fiery world-breath and the searching care. Dost thou long, my rosy-dimpled treasure, To be dealing blows of turmoil there?” “Nay, dream out thy childish years' due number; Hoard the memories of youth's golden shore: Yet a little innocence and slumber, And a mother's arms thy home no more!” IN RESTLESS WOODS THE CASTLE GLEAMS. A BALLAD. In restless woods the castle gleams, The quivering plovers net the sky. She rises from ambrosial dreams, And pensive leans her lattice by. A curl of mountain vapour crests The under-swelling breast of lime; And creeping on the dial's rest, The lichen-blossoms measure time. A mirrored sheet of crystal mere, In lavish threads ice-rillets fill. Round, tapering towards the day-moon, sheer A chalice-rim of circled hill. Her song falls thro' the wavering leaves, The grape shoots near her trellis bars: Her bounteous bosom swells and heaves, Her mellow eyelids veil their stars. Unravels all the yielding hair, Silver in dark, one bright arm drawn, And floods the shoulder arching fair To melt in rustling misty lawn. A fragrance touched with wafted brine Shakes thro' the window seaward set, And freshening on the brow divine Ripples the deep rich-clustered jet, And dies, as from the poplar row A leaflet loosens in the calm: And clear from willow-dykes below The wheatear chatters at the palm. Then faint and subtle, hardly seen, Across her brow dim shadows rise; A motive deepened in her mien, A meaning in her serious eyes. In distant vales a winding horn!— A flush on cheeks of rosied pearl, A glance athwart the crystal morn, A trembling in the raven curl! Why tress so quick the glancing braid? I know a full-branched rowan tree, Whereon, a mile beneath the glade, The wood-birds sing deliciously. AGAIN OR NEVER? Sadly wove the princess in her chamber, Chanted dirges of an ancient lay, “Surely thou art tarrying, my beloved one; Bitter winters mine that bud no May; Marriage bells that very long delay.” Drearily the knight bestrode his charger, By the voices of the soughing sea, “Must I never find thee more my darling? Leaden years creep on and bring not thee; Hope and youth, life's glowing morning, flee.” Shall they ever meet again these fond ones, Folded heart in heart and life to life? Is there “an again” thro' iron ages? Love and destiny in endless strife; Shall the sweet eyes of the brightening dove Glisten on her lord in patient love? THE RIVALS. Three brother princes sate at feast In their old ancestral hall. Above on palace pinnacles The wandered moon-lights fall. The beakers of the elder twain Again and again ran dry; The youngest sang to a harp amain With the fire of hearts gone by. How in the very ancient days The Golden Age began With never a war thro' the wide green earth, And never a fighting man. How beautiful and tender Peace, In crystal cloud-waves veiled, With incense worship thro' all lands A gracious presence sailed. And as he sang and as they drank Stood their little cousin by, And loved the strains, yet ever shrank From the noisy revelry. A radiant maid, in white arrayed; From the rich wreath'd chalice fine The brethren feasted all their eyes As she served the rosy wine. A precious vintage of ripe foam From a delicate hand of snow, The burbling streams with the purple gleams Of a living ember glow. Her deep hair fann'd with revel breath As she leant and the rich juice pour'd, A lily head from her loosening wreath Floated and fell to the board. The eldest grasped the prize with might; The second's blade flashed out; The youngest sang of peace and right Thro' their angry battle shout. The elder's blade to his brother's heart The mail went crashing thro'; The younger clave his elder's brain With an angry aim and true. O maiden, maiden, who shall stay, The fountains of thine eyes? Thy bloom of May, may fade away Ere fresh love-blossoms rise. Thou hadst of wooers one too much, When thou wert wooed of two; Thou hast, in both thy champions dead, Of lovers one too few. DANGER IN HAPPINESS. The falcon builds above the feudal towers Half up the spiral crests of rosied snow. The lark sinks nested in the summer flowers, The swans on glancing mere-waves float and go. From yonder oriel set with purple leaves Accents of love fall trembling towards the vale. Unraised the maiden's eyelids as she weaves, She feels his fire-glance, hears his glowing tale. “Dear wonder, best delight, with gracious breath Wake the ripe roses of thy lips to sound. O, cancel frozen silence worse than death, Speak, and I live. Heaven's music anthems round!” The full white bosom heaves in rippling gauze, About the woof her fingers idly dwell— A trembling and delicious wonder pause Where one small tear in silence filled and fell. What bodes yon crashing hoofs? A jaded steed, A faltering messenger with crimson'd sword,— “The heathen storm thy castle; ride with speed; I hewed out passage thence to bring thee word!” With stedfast gaze upon the maiden's face He heard, her answering eyes no longer dry; Imploringly, as towards some saint of grace, He watch'd the crystal'd eyelash for reply. “Say thou art mine, my danger is a dream, Thy “Yes” would break the shade of death with Sun. “No!” the red battle waits me, and its stream Shall end my sorrow ere 'tis well begun!” “Yet answerless I go not, loved one, speak, For if unloved I fight my nerve shall fail!”— Against his armour then she leant her cheek, And her soft eyes were mirrored in his mail. “Dear, I am thine, ride bravely to the fray, To noble death—to conquest—which betide; Win—thine my heart is always and to-day, Die—and the cloister keeps me still thy bride.” Then, as a vapour of mysterious glory Folded all earth and brightened towards the sky, He kissed her like a hero of old story, And like a hero rode away to die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Classical Sketches. ULYSSES IN THE ISLAND OF OGYGIA. Ulysses. A thousand cities canopied by heaven Hive in the hopes and fears of toil-worn souls; Yet draws man wretched breath in one to match My sorrow, mine endurance? I have warred Nine lagging year-rounds at Old Priam's gates; Fate in the tenth o'erthrew them, tho' a God Had welded their Cyclopean masonwork. Thence to the deeps we launch'd our homeward ships Whose thirsty keels unwonted ocean tasted; Intricate seas we helmed, but man by man My comrades laps'd thro' folly from the light Mostly, yet some of heavier fate dragged down; Till the weak remnant of a thousand toils Foundered when Zeus' white lightning cleft our ship, To rift her storm-strain'd timbers in mid seas, And splinter mast and mainyard hundredfold. I, sole survivor, billow-washed for days Upon a plank of chance, at length with pain Attain this isle-beach. Thrice-loved Ithaca! Thy thought can make me weep—thy rugged shore Outlined in hills more beautiful to me Than this enchanted island, whose delights Out-parallel description. I could wail The dawn to dark remembering thee, and those That loved me and are perished! yearning pain, For fatherland and homestead eats my heart, Refusing ruth or rest, and curds to gall My small and honest joys; the salt of life Drops savourless, as uninvited dreams Usurp my fancy, brooding on past days, And by comparison this present mar. Have Gods assigned a never-ending pain, That I abide reluctantly enslaved By adamant Calypso? All day long Across unmeasured sea I strain mine eyes, Watching and watching every crested wave, Mine eyes tear-heavy, desolate my heart. And so life wanes—time changes—years, long years Shall roll their course, and Ithaca become A memory in forgetfulness. I trace Nor term nor end to these unfruitful days, My permanence of sorrow-bounded age! [Exit. [Hermes alights on the island.]Hermes. From skimming the green shallows I am lighted, Like to the dusk sea-dripping cormorant; For Zeus, who balances the scales of heaven Destiny-poised with hair-adjusted beam, Hath urged me down the bright crags of Olympus, Since this Ulysses multiplied in cares Hath touch'd the seldom grieving ear of Gods, To whom I carry first-fruits of good days! Calypso's prisoner lover. Yet methinks This were a pleasant bondage, if delight Of natural sense could mitigate from pain Intolerable bondage. I consider Amazed this isle's deliciousness, this cave Worthy the Goddess. Tenderly young vines Enlarge their hornèd tendrils, to the whisper Of lulling bees and myriad-noted birds; Here plash the summer's crystal rivulets, Sun-thwarted into rainbow'd waterfalls; Or rosied fountains drift from where beyond The violet meadows deepen. Here the air Stores heavy freight of kindling frankincense, And odorous cedar. In her state the owl Above the entrance perch'd enchanterwise, Kites on the elms, or solemn ravens brood, A quaint assemblage. But Calypso comes From the recesses of her inmost bower, And hitherward her grace-abounding limbs Advance her nimbly. [Enter Calypso.]Calypso. Wherefore art thou here, O herald Hermes of the golden rod? For seldom on our island have thy feet Wandered ere now: but I will not delay To set before thee hospitable fare, Ambrosia, with red nectar; afterwards Thou shalt declare thine errand, guess'd by fear To bode me little pleasure! Hermes. Awful nymph! I may not taste thy banquets till I tell Unerringly the word of heaven's stern king! Thou hast by thee a widely wandered man, Heroic, patient, versed in many toils, Whose much-endurance after ten years' fight Hath pillaged Priam's city. 'Tis with him Mine errand hath relation. I am come No zealous messenger; else who would pass Salt breadths of will and herbless continents, Whence no fair savour from choice hecatomb Delights immortal nostrils? Yet constrained I come, constrained repeat—thus Zeus commands:— “Forthwith dismiss Ulysses, 'tis not fate For him in dalliance to consume his age With thine embraces; rather shall he wend To Ithaca, nor perish far away, Forgetful of return, his home unseen.” Calypso. Jealous and most resentful are ye, Gods! Merciless, iron-hearted, envying me My scanty grain of pleasure. Mortal spouse Ye will not tolerate. Orion died Artemis-wounded for the fatal love Of rosy-fingered morning: thy bright locks, Demeter, thundered down the gleaming bolt Upon thine earthly lover, where the fields, Deep with their sacred furrow-gilding corn, Gave tryst to secret love, and summer winds Crisped tenderly around you, as all fear Melted to ecstasy; but on it came, Zeus' lightning, arrow-wise, and white past snow, Scorched up his quivering heart! then not thy tears, Earth-mother, touched one corner of his soul, The Great All-tyrant! So with me it fares. The restless waves threw out before my cave This mortal drenched and drowned. I drew him forth Beyond their hungry reach—with food and raiment I cherish till I love him, making poor My soul with benefits—and more than this, Immortal years, unwitting of old age, I would have guerdoned. Now Zeus bids him go; And I, most deep in injuries, obey! Hermes. Look thou dismiss him speedily, or dread The after-vengeance of exactful Zeus! Now wend I towards Olympus. [Hermes ascends. Re-enter Ulysses.] Calypso. Lament no more, Ulysses! pitying Gods Have compassed thee return; thy wrestling prayers Have worn consent from their out-wearied ears; Wearied they mark the oceans of salt tears That day by day thy peevish eyes distil, With childlike whine for thy much boasted country, Some nest of barren crags. Since thou must go— Go, and be happy. I will teach thee skill To frame a timber-raft, while hurtless gales Dimple thy sails behind despatched by me! Ulysses. O Goddess! I mistrust, lest some great wrong, Contrivance-woven for my patient soul, Result in ruin rather than return! These seas are terrible, most hard to pass, For equal balanced ships: what madness then Frail raftage trust, unless thou noddest faith, Adding thereon some formidable oath, Thou plottest me no mischief! Calypso. Thou art held Of crafty mind, yet far thou errest here; Lip-wisdom thine no deeper than a phrase! Witness this overblue, this under earth, E'en to her inmost roots, and Tartarus-gloom, And ye, pale current-streams of baleful Styx, I purpose now no evil. Syrups none Of witchcraft, no, nor spells of chanted song, Could win thy silly bent from silly love, Besotted love of Ithaca! My breast Pulses not steel, where throbs a tender heart, And so thou shalt depart; yet couldst thou learn, Unwisest hero! half the bitter teen Thou must fulfil ere this desired return, Thou wouldst not slight my love, but stay with me, And love would make us happy; sweet love dreams In amorous fancy should beguile our days, And we scarce heed their lapsing; and old age Should never reach thee, but thou shouldst attain The priceless gift of immortality,— My gift, that love thee well,—and never more Should there be question of Penelope, Whom thou art ever babbling for. Perchance, My goddess form lacks lustre in compare With her wan earthly beauty! Are her locks More bright than mine? or do I love thee less, Ungrateful mortal, that thou wouldst begone? Ulysses. O Goddess, lull thine angry soul, secure That by thy form ambrosial my poor wife, Whose beauty time and trouble's fret must fade, No longer in the summer of her days, Wanes in comparison. Eternal youth Is thine, nor blemish any, such as taints Earth's daughters' comeliness. Yet mortal I More fitly mate with mortal. For thy bounty All thanks are feeble recompense. Thy love Thou hast outpoured on one, tho' not unworthy, Yet still who may not comprehend the gift, Thro' imperfection of his mortal senses, Beyond his poor deserving doubly rich. Thus am I still most anxious of return, Unbated yet my zeal importunate Once more to watch the smoke-curl from my home Wind up among the mountains. And if fate, Ere I behold it, purpose yet for me Many and bitter things in the dark main, I murmur not! for I have suffered much By wars and waters! and let these things more Be counted towards the fulness of my woes, For I shall bear them, as I bore the rest! Calypso. O, hardly moved and stubborn, thou shalt go! Farewell I ask thee none; no thought of mine Shall whisper thine ingratitude. Depart! Why should I squander passion? Thy wan'd wife Is worthy such as thou, who canst prefer A barren home, a span of fevered days, To spanless years and mine immortal love. THE DIALOGUE OF LIFE. EVENING.—THE SHORE OF THE HELLESPONT. Cassandra. —Æneas. Æneas. In the pure calm of Heaven, unrounded by The thronging palace-walls, our souls breathe in Rest from the evening air. How still the sea Rests too by yonder mountains! Great repose Hath wrapt the Titan nature. I half fancy All could stay thus for ever! Cassandra. Nature is patient, exquisitely patient, Waiting eternity in solemn calm. Thousands of years have o'er this landscape faded, And wrought in fading wondrous little change To its main features—field and stream the same; Deep-wooded bends, where countless stilly dawns Ushered by fine and slender morning breeze, Have run their course; while yonder on the verge Innumerable sunset-lights have wrought Enchanted barriers in the castled clouds, Till farther west the instant changes blent Marbled the rack behind them. Spring and neap, And ebb and flow, the ocean-wash hath dashed O'er those weed-mantled rocks, that sand-ribbed shore; Scarce changed their tide-mark of unwearied waves, Rippling for ages—waiting—grandly patient! Yon light cloud stirs not in Heaven's overblue; But my heart seethes and boils and is so restless. I have not greatness, faith enough, for patience, Or to abide eternity. My soul Faints to be following yonder ebbing sun, Whither she knows not! Æneas. Ay! our youthful dreamings Are but a vague impatience. We imagine Life one great tumult of majestic deeds, Nor take into account that of their lives Whom most we worship many fruitless days, Months, years went by, before the sounding act That made them names and patterns for all time! And even then there came despairing hours Into these great ones' lives; for they had known Heroic deeds, and knew what once they were, And so they could not sink to quiet graves, Content with former fame, if minished aught Of strength, which wanes—of wisdom, that age dims! And thus those lives that most resembled Gods, Most bitter felt their fallings back, and past Hours of most human and most weak despair! Æneas. Yet who may shrink the conflict? Thus our lot Is cast us by immortals. We must front The tempest in our teeth, not pass our days In the hearth corner, sensitive and cold To each external blast of this rude world, Quilted and wrapt from every roughened breath. Cassandra. Yes! action is most glorious, and its pauses Sweeten our dreams the more. 'Tis then so grand Upon a toilsome evening to retrace The story of our lives; to find that we Have lived not quite in vain—that some good deeds Have been reclaimed from the encroachful waste Of idleness and chaos—some poor hours Redeemed from night's dominion—that may move The spirit of the after-worlds to praise When we and ours are ashes. Hearts unborn, Tried with our trials, winning as we won, Shall bless us in a sympathy of fate, And twin their fame with ours! Æneas. Ay! fame, strong fame! That hath held many from a self-sought rush Into the nether night, when life alone Seemed despicable breath. 'Tis only sound, Hardly reality; for shall we care If ages hence that name which once we were Meet censure or find worship? Canst thou think That the dead warrior hears his comrades peal Their shout of victory above his grave Under the fresh-heaped sod? Shall then men's praise Awake us after centuries of decay? Cassandra. Hard the enigmas of the humblest lives; Deep-woven knots and tangles of confusion, Thro' which immortal eyes alone discern Order and law converging ends of good! Æneas. O! we are in their hands, the ancient Gods! They watch our doings from their amber thrones, And move us on like puppets to destruction; Or may be, length of days and broadened rule, To tempt yet ampler sinning. Who may say? I am fast planted as the forest-king, My branches fear no whirlwind, and my roots Have grappled half the mountain! Trust of fools! These Gods of ours that sunshine breathe to-day, To-morrow send their blear Eumenides: The noble tree lies splintered—his huge arms Shall reach no longer at the morning sun, Nor cloud the noonday from his clustered peers! Cassandra. Ay! we endure—and that our help is none, Accept perforce their day-beam, as their bolt— The nobler perish soonest. Woe is me, That treble woe foreseeing ere it fall. Brooding on sorrows destined for dear heads, That laugh themselves, unknowing what I know, In respite from affliction till it strike: And then an ample leisure to bewail, And time enough to mourn it—O forgive, Great master Phœbus, this my querulous heart; Thy visions are too mighty, and all sense Is parch'd away to madness. High thy gift, Inestimably precious; yet not less Thou hast bereft me of all earthward rest, And filled my soul with longings too intense, And aspiration higher than is meet For a weak mortal, and yet weaker maid! Æneas. Trust and despair not! For this passing dream Of thine is but a vapour clinging round The youth-tide of thy life, which ampler day Shall roll beyond the mountains, as yon mist Is rolling back up Gargarus; every height Is kindled in mad radiance; sheeted gold,— Aerial palace heights,—the flashing ocean Mirrors the mountains back—no sound astir, Save a faint hum of voices numberless, That yet I doubt for voices!—Let us go. PARIS AND HELEN AT SPARTA. A CHAMBER IN THE PALACE. Paris —Helen. Spirit Chorus invisible. Come into broad moonshine, Gaze up thro' the pine-roof, The peaks of the valleys Are belted with silver, And nature lies hushed In her longing eternal! O, come where the soft eyes Of first love are waiting: O, come where the wood leaves, The myrtles are deepest. The rose-bloom falls soft, And the heart of the virgin In timid desire Beats love thro' her innermost Pulses, yet hardly Can guess what it means! In this enchantment That thrills to my heart-core? Music of many harps, Trills as of summer bees: Ecstasy, whirring wings, Like as the starling cloud Darkens the sun-gold. With a rush—with a whirl, Spirits of middle air Hover and glancingly Flicker and rise: Some they have belted them Mantles of rainbow; Some they have taken them Circlet or crown. Myriad crested ones Bending the summer air. Myriad noiseless shapes Threading the orient cloud. Numberless rudder-led Ships on the waves, Galleons, argosies, Freighted with jewels; Seraphs shall helm them to haven— Dreams of the ruddy East, Flooded with fiercer suns, Dreams of the exquisite Mellowing twilights, more exquisite dawns— Visions of mighty hoards, Diamond, amber, pearl, Ingots of red gold, Piled up at the earth-roots, And striving to burst thro' The caves of their bondage. Lo! serpents are writhing With sapphire-set eyes, From yonder blue forests And round the great oak boles They coil and they vibrate, And, raising their lithe heads O'er uppermost branches, Glare over the main. The wave-birds are floating, And call to each other— “The silver is restless To-night on the sea.” But answers a seraph With star-burnished wings, Hovering gaudy as Rosy-blue butterfly Over the violets Blossoming faintly— “O ocean to-night Is as lucid and tender As eyes of the loved one! Ye spirits of exquisite Vision look down; Perchance ye shall see them Peer up thro' the clear waves So deep blue and tearful, The eyes most bewitching, Of sad Amphitritè Awaiting Poseidon.” [The Chorus grows faint. Paris. Methought I heard a thousand tiny harps, Attuned by spirits, and their gauzy wings Filled all the air with motion: in my dreams They sang me songs of ecstasy, and beckoned On towards some rich Elysium. Didst thou hear them? Helen. Dearest, the palace slumbers. All the waves Of old Eurotas rippling speak of rest. The flowers bend over where he runs along Sleep-heavy, perhaps they dream his waves are bringing Some one to love them. In yon heaven one star Shines out above the town—a pitying spirit, That would shed love on those who find it not— Love! love! is all around us, the still air We breathe, the utterance of half-stifled sighs, The mighty sympathy of mere existence, Hand circling hand, and heart-beat answering heart. Hush! is that murmur from the southern sea? It scarce would reach us on the calmest night. No! 'tis the night breeze that hath not forgot How moans the ocean over which it past! Paris. Why art thou melancholy, oh, my darling? Gleams from the morning land are shedding now, Wave upon wave, and Phosphor's wakeful sphere Reddens or pales, as thro' our inmost souls Thrills on the mighty consciousness of love, The flood or ebb of exquisite despair! Time and ambition seem as empty fancies, The perfect present is absorbing all. Will not one breath, one little breath of morning, Touch thy pale cheek, and kindle it to glow? Gaze out into the violet vaulted dark, Half night, and chide the coming of the day; Ah no! The lover asks no rising sun, Shrouded in scented darkness near his love, Encircled closely as the atmosphere About the radiance of his own dear star! Helen. O brighter than all gold of earthly mine, Apollo rises—how the graceful hours Come tripping out before him—shivering night Rolls backward on the upland—mist and cloud Linger in vain with sullen slow retreat. Could limner's art eternalize the glory Of yonder sunrise? Radiant, awful king, Hyperion! Thou, god of rich morning-tide, Steepest our souls with unimagined longings To leave us fainting in a flood of glory. Paris. I revel in a garden deep with roses, I float upon a tide of quivering silver; I could outpierce the infinite vault of Heaven Beyond the crested lark, or take me wings To catch the sunrise. Nature, art, or mind Hath nought impossible to perfect love. My love is perfect when I gaze on thee; Thy little arms are open, and they beckon With tender supplication to thy breast. Helen. Love at its birth is thornless, like the rose; But envious briers entrench her perfect bloom. And dreads assail the ripeness of our love, That menaced not its budding. Or shall we Escape, I doubt not, more than other souls Out mulct of evil days? Paris. Forecast them not. Let us at least be merry till they come. And should suspicion sullen-fronted loom, My fleet shall steer to yonder rising day— To snatch thee from the chill and envious grasp, Triumphant, making unity secure,— With sea-room for the universe besides,— Whence we could fling defiance at the world If Greece entire sailed after. Helen. Grant it gained, I tremble, womanlike, to think this done, Altho' my prayers desire it: for my name Shall grow into a byword, and my story Pass current warning to each giddy maid Flouting advice, and brainless save conceit, Grown restive from the mother's timely curb. O horrible! And all those island kings, My former suitors, shall in great disdain Cry shame upon me. What an army weight Of reasons to press down high duty's beam! And in the other balance nought, save love! Paris. You cheat yourself in multiplying dread Of this imagined sequel. Public voice Is lenient to great beauty; were the case Not far too common for censorious tongues To act the bellman of a husband's wrong, While flush of prey more tainted. Very soon The widening circles vanish into nought, And all will be forgot; but we shall not Forget our love, enjoying perfect days, And in the sympathy of kindred souls Pass calmly onwards to our after rest. For Aphroditè pledged thee as my bride; And think'st thou yon blest Gods would sanction wrong, Except for some great purpose that shall make The wrong one drop upon a sea of good? THE END.</field>
