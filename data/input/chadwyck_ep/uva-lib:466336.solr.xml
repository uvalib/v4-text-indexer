      <field name="fulltext">February 17th, 1884. “It was not, to restore thy flickering breath, Or hold thee back, just nearing towards the Light, But—whilst that Sun of Life, whom we name Death, Rose on thy closing, or thy opening sight— To catch some whisper of thy new delight, Some earnest of thy fainting soul's surprise, And see the radiance quickening through the veil Of palsied speech and leaden-lidded eyes,— That we, bright Spirit! who stood and watched thee fail And sink, and pass through gloom and utter night, One instant, and no more, would fain have stayed thy flight!” W.J.S.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VERSES VISIONS “She was a phantom,” &amp;c. In lone Glenartney's thickets lies couched the lordly stag, The dreaming terrier's tail forgets its customary wag; And plodding ploughmen's weary steps insensibly grow quicker, As broadening casements light them on toward home, or homebrewed liquor. It is in brief the evening—that pure and pleasant time, When stars break into splendour, and poets into rhyme; When in the glass of Memory the forms of loved ones shine— And when, of course, Miss Goodchild's is prominent in mine. Miss Goodchild!—Julia Goodchild!—how graciously you smiled Upon my childish passion once, yourself a fair-haired child: When I was (no doubt) profiting by Dr. Crabb's instruction, And sent those streaky lollipops home for your fairy suction! “She wore” her natural “roses, the night when first we met”— Her golden hair was gleaming 'neath the coercive net: “Her brow was like the snawdrift,” her step was like Queen Mab's, And gone was instantly the heart of every boy at Crabb's. The parlour boarder chasséed tow'rds her on graceful limb; The onyx deck'd his bosom—but her smiles were not for him: With me she danced—till drowsily her eyes “began to blink,” And I brought raisin wine, and said, “Drink, pretty creature, drink!” And evermore, when winter comes in his garb of snows, And the returning schoolboy is told how fast he grows; Shall I—with that soft hand in mine—enact ideal Lancers, And dream I hear demure remarks, and make impassioned answers:— I know that never, never may her love for me return— At night I muse upon the fact with undisguised concern— But ever shall I bless that day: I don't bless, as a rule, The days I spent at “Dr. Crabb's Preparatory School.” And yet we two may meet again—(Be still, my throbbing heart!) Now rolling years have weaned us from jam and raspberry-tart. One night I saw a vision—'Twas when musk-roses bloom, I stood—we stood—upon a rug, in a sumptuous dining-room: One hand clasped hers—one easily reposed upon my hip— And “Bless ye!” burst abruptly from Mr. Goodchild's lip: I raised my brimming eye, and saw in hers an answering gleam— My heart beat wildly—and I woke, and lo! it was a dream. GEMINI AND VIRGO Some vast amount of years ago, Ere all my youth had vanish'd from me, A boy it was my lot to know, Whom his familiar friends called Tommy. I love to gaze upon a child; A young bud bursting into blossom; Artless, as Eve yet unbeguiled, And agile as a young opossum: And such was he. A calm-brow'd lad, Yet mad, at moments, as a hatter: Why hatters as a race are mad I never knew, nor does it matter. He was what nurses call a “limb”; One of those small misguided creatures, Who, tho' their intellects are dim, Are one too many for their teachers: And, if you asked of him to say What twice 10 was, or 3 times 7, He'd glance (in quite a placid way) From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; And smile, and look politely round, To catch a casual suggestion; But make no effort to propound Any solution of the question. And so not much esteemed was he Of the authorities: and therefore He fraternized by chance with me, Needing a somebody to care for: And three fair summers did we twain Live (as they say) and love together; And bore by turns the wholesome cane Till our young skins became as leather: And carved our names on every desk, And tore our clothes, and inked our collars; And looked unique and picturesque, But not, it may be, model scholars. We did much as we chose to do; We'd never heard of Mrs. Grundy; All the theology we knew Was that we mightn't play on Sunday; And all the general truths, that cakes Were to be bought at four a penny, And that excruciating aches Resulted if we ate too many. And seeing ignorance is bliss, And wisdom consequently folly, The obvious result is this— That our two lives were very jolly. At last the separation came. Real love, at that time, was the fashion; And by a horrid chance, the same Young thing was, to us both, a passion. Old Poser snorted like a horse: His feet were large, his hands were pimply, His manner, when excited, coarse:— But Miss P. was an angel simply. She was a blushing, gushing thing; All—more than all—my fancy painted; Once—when she helped me to a wing Of goose—I thought I should have fainted. The people said that she was blue: But I was green, and loved her dearly. She was approaching thirty-two; And I was then eleven, nearly. I did not love as others do; (None ever did that I've heard tell of;) My passion was a byword through The town she was, of course, the belle of. Oh sweet—as to the toilworn man The far-off sound of rippling river; As to cadets in Hindostan The fleeting remnant of their liver— To me was Anna; dear as gold That fills the miser's sunless coffers; As to the spinster, growing old, The thought—the dream—that she had offers. I'd sent her little gifts of fruit; I'd written lines to her as Venus; I'd sworn unflinchingly to shoot The man who dared to come between us: And it was you, my Thomas, you, The friend in whom my soul confided, Who dared to gaze on her—to do, I may say, much the same as I did. One night, I saw him squeeze her hand; There was no doubt about the matter; I said he must resign, or stand My vengeance—and he chose the latter. We met, we “planted” blows on blows: We fought as long as we were able: My rival had a bottle-nose, And both my speaking eyes were sable, When the school-bell cut short our strife. Miss P. gave both of us a plaister; And in a week became the wife Of Horace Nibbs, the writing-master. I loved her then—I'd love her still, Only one must not love Another's: But thou and I, my Tommy, will, When we again meet, meet as brothers. It may be that in age one seeks Peace only: that the blood is brisker In boys' veins, than in theirs whose cheeks Are partially obscured by whisker; Or that the growing ages steal The memories of past wrongs from us. But this is certain—that I feel Most friendly unto thee, oh Thomas! And whereso'er we meet again, On this or that side the equator, If I've not turned teetotaller then, And have wherewith to pay the waiter, To thee I'll drain the modest cup, Ignite with thee the mild Havannah; And we will waft, while liquoring up, Forgiveness to the heartless Anna. “THERE STANDS A CITY” “There stands a city.” Ingoldsby. Year by year do Beauty's daughters, In the sweetest gloves and shawls, Troop to taste the Chattenham waters, And adorn the Chattenham balls. “Nulla non donanda lauru,” Is that city: you could not, Placing England's map before you, Light on a more favour'd spot. If no clear translucent river Winds 'neath willow-shaded paths, “Children and adults” may shiver All day in “Chalybeate baths”: And on every side the painter Looks on wooded vale and plain And on fair hills, faint and fainter Outlined as they near the main. There I met with him, my chosen Friend—the “long” but not “stern swell,” “The kites know well the long stern swell That bids the Romans close.”—Macaulay. Faultless in his hats and hosen, Whom the Johnian lawns know well:— Oh my comrade, ever valued! Still I see your festive face; Hear you humming of “the gal you'd Left behind” in massive bass: See you sit with that composure On the eeliest of hacks, That the novice would suppose your Manly limbs encased in wax: Or anon, when evening lent her Tranquil light to hill and vale, Urge, towards the table's centre, With unerring hand, the squail. Ah delectablest of summers! How my heart—that “muffled drum” Which ignores the aid of drummers— Beats, as back thy memories come! O among the dancers peerless, Fleet of foot, and soft of eye! Need I say to you that cheerless Must my days be till I die? At my side she mashed the fragrant Strawberry; lashes soft as silk Drooped o'er saddened eyes, when vagrant Gnats sought watery graves in milk: Then we danced, we walked together; Talked—no doubt on trivial topics; Such as Blondin, or the weather, Which “recalled us to the tropics.” But—O in the deuxtemps peerless, Fleet of foot, and soft of eye!— Once more I repeat, that cheerless Shall my days be till I die. And the lean and hungry raven, As he picks my bones, will start To observe “M.N.” engraven Neatly on my blighted heart. STRIKING IT was a railway passenger, And he lept out jauntilie. “Now up and bear, thou stout portèr, My two chattèls to me. “Bring hither, bring hither my bag so red, And portmanteau so brown: (They lie in the van, for a trusty man He labelled them London town:) “And fetch me eke a cabman bold, That I may be his fare, his fare; And he shall have a good shilling, If by two of the clock he do me bring To the Terminus, Euston Square.” “Now,—so to thee the saints alway, Good gentleman, give luck,— As never a cab may I find this day, For the cabman wights have struck: And now, I wis, at the Red Post Inn, Or else at the Dog and Duck, Or at Unicorn Blue, or at Green Griffin, The nut-brown ale and the fine old gin Right pleasantly they do suck.” “Now rede me aright, thou stout portèr, What were it best that I should do: For woe is me, an' I reach not there Or ever the clock strike two.” “I have a son, a lytel son; Fleet is his foot as the wild roebuck's: Give him a shilling, and eke a brown, And he shall carry thy fardels down To Euston, or half over London town, On one of the station trucks.” Then forth in a hurry did they twain fare, The gent, and the son of the stout portèr, Who fled like an arrow, nor turned a hair, Through all the mire and muck: “A ticket, a ticket, sir clerk, I pray: For by two of the clock must I needs away.” “That may hardly be,” the clerk did say, “For indeed—the clocks have struck.” ABC A is an Angel of blushing eighteen: B is the Ball where the Angel was seen: C is her Chaperon, who cheated at cards: D is the Deuxtemps, with Frank of the Guards: E is her Eye, killing slowly but surely: F is the Fan, whence it peeped so demurely: G is the Glove of superlative kid: H is the Hand which it spitefully hid: I is the Ice which the fair one demanded: L is the Juvenile, that dainty who handed: K is the Kerchief, a rare work of art: L is the Lace which composed the chief part: M is the old Maid who watch'd the chits dance: N is the Nose she turned up at each glance: O is the Olga (just then in its prime): P is the Partner who wouldn't keep time: Q 's a Quadrille, put instead of the Lancers: R is the Remonstrances made by the dancers: S is the Supper, where all went in pairs: T is the Twaddle they talked on the stairs: U is the Uncle who “thought we'd be goin':” V is the Voice which his niece replied “No” in: W is the Waiter, who sat up till eight: X is his Exit, not rigidly straight: Y is a Yawning fit caused by the Ball: Z stands for Zero, or nothing at all. VOICES OF THE NIGHT “The tender Grace of a day that is dead.” The dew is on the roses, The owl hath spread her wing; And vocal are the noses Of peasant and of king: “Nature” in short “reposes”; But I do no such thing. Pent in my lonesome study Here I must sit and muse; Sit till the morn grows ruddy, Till, rising with the dews, “Jeameses” remove the muddy Spots from their masters' shoes. Yet are sweet faces flinging Their witchery o'er me here: I hear sweet voices singing A song as soft, as clear, As (previously to stinging) A gnat sings round one's ear. Does Grace draw young Apollos In blue mustachios still? Does Emma tell the swallows How she will pipe and trill, When, some fine day, she follows Those birds to the window-sill? And oh! has Albert faded From Grace's memory yet? Albert, whose “brow was shaded By locks of glossiest jet,” Whom almost any lady'd Have given her eyes to get? Does not her conscience smite her For one who hourly pines, Thinking her bright eyes brighter Than any star that shines— I mean of course the writer Of these pathetic lines? Who knows? As quoth Sir Walter, “Time rolls his ceaseless course: “The Grace of yore” may alter— And then, I've one resource: I'll invest in a bran-new halter, And I'll perish without remorse. LINES SUGGESTED BY THE FOURTEENTH OF FEBRUARY Ere the morn the East has crimsoned, When the stars are twinkling there, (As they did in Watts's Hymns, and Made him wonder what they were:) When the forest-nymphs are beading Fern and flower with silvery dew— My infallible proceeding Is to wake, and think of you. When the hunter's ringing bugle Sounds farewell to field and copse, And I sit before my frugal Meal of gravy-soup and chops: When (as Gray remarks) “the moping Owl doth to the moon complain,” And the hour suggests eloping— Fly my thoughts to you again. May my dreams be granted never? Must I aye endure affliction Rarely realized, if ever, In our wildest works of fiction? Madly Romeo loved his Juliet; Copperfield began to pine When he hadn't been to school yet— But their loves were cold to mine. Give me hope, the least, the dimmest, Ere I drain the poisoned cup: Tell me I may tell the chymist Not to make that arsenic up! Else the heart must cease to throb in This my breast; and when, in tones Hushed, men ask, “Who killed Cock Robin?” They'll be told, “Miss Clara J?s.” TO MRS. GOODCHILD The night-wind's shriek is pitiless and hollow, The boding bat flits by on sullen wing, And I sit desolate, like that “one swallow” Who found (with horror) that he'd not brought spring: Lonely as he who erst with venturous thumb Drew from its pie-y lair the solitary plum. And to my gaze the phantoms of the Past, The cherished fictions of my boyhood, rise: I see Red Ridinghood observe, aghast, The fixed expression of her grandam's eyes; I hear the fiendish chattering and chuckling Which those misguided fowls raised at the Ugly Duckling. The House that Jack built—and the Malt that lay Within the House—the Rat that ate the Malt— The Cat, that in that sanguinary way Punished the poor thing for its venial fault— The Worrier-Dog—the Cow with crumpled horn— And then—ah yes! and then—the Maiden all forlorn! O Mrs. Gurton—(may I call thee Gammer?) Thou more than mother to my infant mind! I loved thee better than I loved my grammar— I used to wonder why the Mice were blind, And who was gardener to Mistress Mary, And what—I don't know still—was meant by “quite contrary.” “Tota contraria,” an “Arundo Cami” Has phrased it—which is possibly explicit, Ingenious certainly—but all the same I Still ask, when coming on the word, “What is it?” There were more things in Mrs. Gurton's eye, Mayhap, than are dreamed of in our philosophy. No doubt the Editor of “Notes and Queries” Or “Things not generally known” could tell The word's real force—my only lurking fear is That the great Gammer “didna ken hersel”: (I've precedent, yet feel I owe apology For passing in this way to Scottish phraseology). Also, dear Madam, I must ask your pardon For making this unwarranted digression, Starting (I think) from Mistress Mary's garden:— And beg to send, with every expression Of personal esteem, a Book of Rhymes, For Master G. to read at miscellaneous times. There is a youth, who keeps a “crumpled Horn,” (Living next me, upon the selfsame story,) And ever, 'twixt the midnight and the morn, He solaces his soul with Annie Laurie. The tune is good; the habit p'raps romantic; But tending, if pursued, to drive one's neighbours frantic. And now,—at this unprecedented hour, When the young Dawn is “trampling out the stars,”— I hear that youth—with more than usual power And pathos—struggling with the first few bars. And I do think the amateur cornopean Should be put down by law—but that's perhaps Utopian. Who knows what “things unknown” I might have “bodied Forth,” if not checked by that absurd Too-too? But don't I know that when my friend has plodded Through the first verse, the second will ensue? Considering which, dear Madam, I will merely Send the beforenamed book—and am yours most sincerely. ODE—“ON A DISTANT PROSPECT” OF MAKING A FORTUNE Now the “rosy morn appearing” Floods with light the dazzled heaven; And the schoolboy groans on hearing That eternal clock strike seven:— Now the waggoner is driving Tow'rds the fields his clattering wain; Now the blue-bottle, reviving, Buzzes down his native pane. But to me the morn is hateful: Wearily I stretch my legs, Dress, and settle to my plateful Of (perhaps inferior) eggs. Yesterday Miss Crump, by message, Mentioned “rent,” which “p'raps I'd pay;” And I have a dismal presage That she'll call, herself, to-day. Once, I breakfasted off rosewood, Smoked through silver-mounted pipes— Then how my patrician nose would Turn up at the thought of “swipes”! Ale,—occasionally claret,— Graced my luncheon then;—and now I drink porter in a garret, To be paid for heaven knows how. When the evening shades are deepened, And I doff my hat and gloves, No sweet bird is there to “cheep and Twitter twenty million loves;” No dark-ringleted canaries Sing to me of “hungry foam;” No imaginary “Marys” Call fictitious “cattle home.” Araminta, sweetest, fairest! Solace once of every ill! How I wonder if thou bearest Mivins in remembrance still! If that Friday night is banished From a once retentive mind, When the others somehow vanished, And we two were left behind:— When in accents low, yet thrilling, I did all my love declare; Mentioned that I'd not a shilling— Hinted that we need not care; And complacently you listened To my somewhat long address, And I thought the tear that glistened In the downdropt eye said Yes. Once, a happy child, I carolled O'er green lawns the whole day through, Not unpleasingly apparelled In a tightish suit of blue:— What a change has now passed o'er me! Now with what dismay I see Every rising morn before me! Goodness gracious patience me! And I'll prowl, a moodier Lara, Thro' the world, as prowls the bat, And habitually wear a Cypress wreath around my hat: And when Death snuffs out the taper Of my Life (as soon he must), I'll send up to every paper, “Died, T. Mivins; of disgust.” ISABEL Now o'er the landscape crowd the deepening shades, And the shut lily cradles not the bee; The red deer couches in the forest glades, And faint the echoes of the slumberous sea: And ere I rest, one prayer I'll breathe for thee, The sweet Egeria of my lonely dreams: Lady, forgive, that ever upon me Thoughts of thee linger, as the soft starbeams Linger on Merlin's rock, or dark Sabrina's streams. On gray Pilatus once we loved to stray, And watch far off the glimmering roselight break O'er the dim mountain-peaks, ere yet one ray Pierced the deep bosom of the mist-clad lake. Oh! who felt not new life within him wake, And his pulse quicken, and his spirit burn— (Save one we wot of, whom the cold did make Feel “shooting pains in every joint in turn,”) When first he saw the sun gild thy green shores, Lucerne? And years have past, and I have gazed once more On blue lakes glistening amid mountains blue; And all seemed sadder, lovelier than before— For all awakened memories of you. Oh! had I had you by my side, in lieu Of that red matron, whom the flies would worry, (Flies in those parts unfortunately do,) Who walked so slowly, talked in such a hurry, And with such wild contempt for stops and Lindley Murray! O Isabel, the brightest, heavenliest theme That e'er drew dreamer on to poësy, Since “Peggy's locks” made Burns neglect his team, And Stella's smile lured Johnson from his tea— I may not tell thee what thou art to me! But ever dwells the soft voice in my ear, Whispering of what Time is, what Man might be, Would he but “do the duty that lies near,” And cut clubs, cards, champagne, balls, billiard-rooms, and beer. LINES SUGGESTED BY THE FOURTEENTH OF FEBRUARY Darkness succeeds to twilight: Through lattice and through skylight, The stars no doubt, if one looked out, Might be observed to shine: And sitting by the embers I elevate my members On a stray chair, and then and there Commence a Valentine. Yea! by St. Valentinus, Emma shall not be minus What all young ladies, whate'er their grade is, Expect to-day no doubt: Emma the fair, the stately— Whom I beheld so lately, Smiling beneath the snow-white wreath Which told that she was “out.” Wherefore fly to her, swallow, And mention that I'd “follow,” And “pipe and trill,” et cetera, till I died, had I but wings: Say the North's “true and tender,” The South an old offender; And hint in fact, with your well-known tact, All kinds of pretty things. Say I grow hourly thinner, Simply abhor my dinner— Tho' I do try and absorb some viand Each day, for form's sake merely: And ask her, when all's ended, And I am found extended, With vest blood-spotted and cut carotid, To think on Hers sincerely. “HIC VIR, HIC EST” Often, when o'er tree and turret, Eve a dying radiance flings, By that ancient pile I linger Known familiarly as “King's.” And the ghosts of days departed Rise, and in my burning breast All the undergraduate wakens, And my spirit is at rest. What, but a revolting fiction, Seems the actual result Of the Census's enquiries Made upon the 15th ult.? Still my soul is in its boyhood; Nor of year or changes recks, Though my scalp is almost hairless, And my figure grows convex. Backward moves the kindly dial; And I'm numbered once again With those noblest of their species Called emphatically “Men:” Loaf, as I have loafed aforetime, Through the streets, with tranquil mind, And a long-backed fancy-mongrel Trailing casually behind: Past the Senate-house I saunter, Whistling with an easy grace; Past the cabbage-stalks that carpet Still the beefy market-place; Poising evermore the eye-glass In the light sarcastic eye, Lest, by chance, some breezy nursemaid Pass, without a tribute, by. Once, an unassuming Freshman, Thro' these wilds I wandered on, Seeing in each house a College, Under every cap a Don: Each perambulating infant Had a magic in its squall, For my eager eye detected Senior Wranglers in them all. By degrees my education Grew, and I became as others; Learned to blunt my moral feelings By the aid of Bacon Brothers; Bought me tiny boots of Mortlock, And colossal prints of Roe; And ignored the proposition That both time and money go. Learned to work the wary dogcart Artfully thro' King's Parade; Dress, and steer a boat, and sport with Amaryllis in the shade: Struck, at Brown's, the dashing hazard; Or (more curious sport than that) Dropped, at Callaby's, the terrier Down upon the prisoned rat. I have stood serene on Fenner's Ground, indifferent to blisters, While the Buttress of the period Bowled me his peculiar twisters: Sung “We won't go home till morning;” Striven to part my backhair straight; Drunk (not lavishly) of Miller's Old dry wines at 78/:— When within my veins the blood ran, And the curls were on my brow, I did, oh ye undergraduates, Much as ye are doing now. Wherefore bless ye, O beloved ones:— Now unto mine inn must I, Your “poor moralist,” “Poor moralist, and what art thou? A solitary fly.” Gray. betake me, In my “solitary fly.” BEER In those old days which poets say were golden— (Perhaps they laid the gilding on themselves: And, if they did, I'm all the more beholden To those brown dwellers in my dusty shelves, Who talk to me “in language quaint and olden” Of gods and demigods and fauns and elves, Pan with his pipes, and Bacchus with his leopards, And staid young goddesses who flirt with shepherds:) In those old days, the Nymph called Etiquette (Appalling thought to dwell on) was not born. They had their May, but no Mayfair as yet, No fashions varying as the hues of morn. Just as they pleased they dressed and drank and ate, Sang hymns to Ceres (their John Barleycorn) And danced unchaperoned, and laughed unchecked, And were no doubt extremely incorrect. Yet do I think their theory was pleasant: And oft, I own, my “wayward fancy roams” Back to those times, so different from the present; When no one smoked cigars, nor gave At-homes, Nor smote a billiard-ball, nor winged a pheasant, Nor “did” her hair by means of long-tailed combs, Nor migrated to Brighton once a year, Nor—most astonishing of all—drank Beer. No, they did not drink Beer, “which brings me to” (As Gilpin said) “the middle of my song.” Not that “the middle” is precisely true, Or else I should not tax your patience long: If I had said “beginning,” it might do; But I have a dislike to quoting wrong: I was unlucky—sinned against, not sinning— When Cowper wrote down “middle” for “beginning.” So to proceed. That abstinence from Malt Has always struck me as extremely curious. The Greek mind must have had some vital fault, That they should stick to liquors so injurious— (Wine, water, tempered p'raps with Attic salt)— And not at once invent that mild, luxurious, And artful beverage, Beer. How the digestion Got on without it, is a startling question. Had they digestions? and an actual body Such as dyspepsia might make attacks on? Were they abstract ideas—(like Tom Noddy And Mr. Briggs)—or men, like Jones and Jackson? Then nectar—was that beer, or whisky-toddy? Some say the Gaelic mixture, I the Saxon: I think a strict adherence to the latter Might make some Scots less pigheaded, and fatter. Besides, Bon Gaultier definitely shows That the real beverage for feasting gods on Is a soft compound, grateful to the nose And also to the palate, known as “Hodgson.” I know a man—a tailor's son—who rose To be a peer: and this I would lay odds on, (Though in his Memoirs it may not appear,) That that man owed his rise to copious Beer. O Beer! O Hodgson, Guinness, Allsopp, Bass! Names that should be on every infant's tongue! Shall days and months and years and centuries pass, And still your merits be unrecked, unsung? Oh! I have gazed into my foaming glass, And wished that lyre could yet again be strung Which once rang prophet-like through Greece, and taught her Misguided sons that the best drink was water. How would he now recant that wild opinion, And sing—as would that I could sing—of you! I was not born (alas!) the “Muses' minion,” I'm not poetical, not even blue: And he, we know, but strives with waxen pinion, Whoe'er he is that entertains the view Of emulating Pindar, and will be Sponsor at last to some now nameless sea. Oh! when the green slopes of Arcadia burned With all the lustre of the dying day, And on Cithæron's brow the reaper turned, (Humming, of course, in his delightful way, How Lycidas was dead, and how concerned The Nymphs were when they saw his lifeless clay; And how rock told to rock the dreadful story That poor young Lycidas was gone to glory:) What would that lone and labouring soul have given, At that soft moment for a pewter pot! How had the mists that dimmed his eye been riven, And Lycidas and sorrow all forgot! If his own grandmother had died unshriven, In two short seconds he'd have recked it not; Such power hath Beer. The heart which Grief hath canker'd Hath one unfailing remedy—the Tankard. Coffee is good, and so no doubt is cocoa; Tea did for Johnson and the Chinamen: When “Dulce est desipere in loco” Was written, real Falernian winged the pen. When a rapt audience has encored “Fra Poco” Or “Casta Diva,” I have heard that then The Prima Donna, smiling herself out, Recruits her flagging powers with bottled stout. But what is coffee, but a noxious berry, Born to keep used-up Londoners awake? What is Falernian, what is Port or Sherry, But vile concoctions to make dull heads ache? Nay stout itself—(though good with oysters, very)— Is not a thing your reading man should take. He that would shine, and petrify his tutor, Should drink draught Allsopp in its “native pewter.” But hark! a sound is stealing on my ear— A soft and silvery sound—I know it well. Its tinkling tells me that a time is near Precious to me—it is the Dinner Bell. O blessed Bell! Thou bringest beef and beer, Thou bringest good things more than tongue may tell: Seared is, of course, my heart—but unsubdued Is, and shall be, my appetite for food. I go. Untaught and feeble is my pen: But on one statement I may safely venture: That few of our most highly gifted men Have more appreciation of the trencher. I go. One pound of British beef, and then What Mr. Swiveller called a “modest quencher”; That home-returning, I may “soothly say,” “Fate cannot touch me: I have dined to-day.” ODE TO TOBACCO Thou who, when fears attack, Bidst them avaunt, and Black Care, at the horseman's back Perching, unseatest; Sweet, when the morn is gray; Sweet, when they've cleared away Lunch; and at close of day Possibly sweetest; I have a liking old For thee, though manifold Stories, I know, are told, Not to thy credit; How one (or two at most) Drops make a cat a ghost— Useless, except to roast— Doctors have said it: How they who use fusees All grow by slow degrees Brainless as chimpanzees, Meagre as lizards: Go mad, and beat their wives; Plunge (after shocking lives) Razors and carving knives Into their gizzards. Confound such knavish tricks! Yet know I five or six Smokers who freely mix Still with their neighbours; Jones—(who, I'm glad to say, Asked leave of Mrs. J.)— Daily absorbs a clay After his labours. Cats may have had their goose Cooked by tobacco-juice; Still why deny its use Thoughtfully taken? We're not as tabbies are: Smith, take a fresh cigar! Jones, the tobacco-jar! Here's to thee, Bacon! DOVER TO MUNICH Farewell, farewell! Before our prow Leaps in white foam the noisy channel; A tourist's cap is on my brow, My legs are cased in tourist's flannel: Around me gasp the invalids— The quantity to-night is fearful— I take a brace or so of weeds, And feel (as yet) extremely cheerful. The night wears on:—my thirst I quench With one imperial pint of porter; Then drop upon a casual bench— (The bench is short, but I am shorter)— Place 'neath my head the havre-sac Which I have stowed my little all in, And sleep, though moist about the back, Serenely in an old tarpaulin. Bed at Ostend at 5 A.M. Breakfast at 6, and train 6.30, Tickets to Königswinter (mem. The seats unutterably dirty). And onward thro' those dreary flats We move, and scanty space to sit on, Flanked by stout girls with steeple hats, And waists that paralyse a Briton;— By many a tidy little town, Where tidy little Fraus sit knitting; (The men's pursuits are, lying down, Smoking perennial pipes, and spitting;) And doze, and execrate the heat, And wonder how far off Cologne is, And if we shall get aught to eat, Till we get there, save raw polonies: Until at last the “gray old pile” Is seen, is past, and three hours later We're ordering steaks, and talking vile Mock-German to an Austrian waiter. Königswinter, hateful Königswinter! Burying-place of all I loved so well! Never did the most extensive printer Print a tale so dark as thou could'st tell! In the sapphire West the eve yet lingered, Bathed in kindly light those hill-tops cold; Fringed each cloud, and, stooping rosy-fingered, Changed Rhine's waters into molten gold;— While still nearer did his light waves splinter Into silvery shafts the streaming light; And I said I loved thee, Königswinter, For the glory that was thine that night. And we gazed, till slowly disappearing, Like a day-dream, passed the pageant by, And I saw but those lone hills, uprearing Dull dark shapes against a hueless sky. Then I turned, and on those bright hopes pondered Whereof yon gay fancies were the type; And my hand mechanically wandered Towards my left-hand pocket for a pipe. Ah! why starts each eyeball from its socket, As, in Hamlet, start the guilty Queen's? There, deep-hid in its accustomed pocket, Lay my sole pipe, smashed to smithereens! On, on the vessel steals; Round go the paddle-wheels, And now the tourist feels As he should; For king-like rolls the Rhine, And the scenery's divine, And the victuals and the wine Rather good. From every crag we pass'll Rise up some hoar old castle; The hanging fir-groves tassel Every slope; And the vine her lithe arm stretches Over peasants singing catches— And you'll make no end of sketches, I should hope. We've a nun here (called Therèse), Two couriers out of place, One Yankee with a face Like a ferret's: And three youths in scarlet caps Drinking chocolate and schnapps— A diet which perhaps Has its merits. And day again declines: In shadow sleep the vines, And the last ray thro' the pines Feebly glows, Then sinks behind yon ridge; And the usual evening midge Is settling on the bridge Of my nose. And keen's the air and cold, And the sheep are in the fold, And Night walks sable-stoled Thro' the trees; And on the silent river The floating starbeams quiver;— And now, the saints deliver Us from fleas. Avenues of broad white houses, Basking in the noontide glare;— Streets, which foot of traveller shrinks from, As on hot plates shrinks the bear;— Elsewhere lawns, and vista'd gardens, Statues white, and cool arcades, Where at eve the German warrior Winks upon the German maids;— Such is Munich:—broad and stately, Rich of hue, and fair of form; But, towards the end of August, Unequivocally warm. There, the long dim galleries threading, May the artist's eye behold Breathing from the “deathless canvas” Records of the years of old: Pallas there, and Jove, and Juno, “Take” once more their “walks abroad,” Under Titian's fiery woodlands And the saffron skies of Claude: There the Amazons of Rubens Lift the failing arm to strike, And the pale light falls in masses On the horsemen of Vandyke; And in Berghem's pools reflected Hang the cattle's graceful shapes, And Murillo's soft boy-faces Laugh amid the Seville grapes; And all purest, loveliest fancies That in poets' souls may dwell Started into shape and substance At the touch of Raphael. Lo! her wan arms folded meekly, And the glory of her hair Falling as a robe around her, Kneels the Magdalen in prayer; And the white-robed Virgin-mother Smiles, as centuries back she smiled, Half in gladness, half in wonder, On the calm face of her Child:— And that mighty Judgment-vision Tells how man essayed to climb Up the ladder of the ages, Past the frontier-walls of Time; Heard the trumpet-echoes rolling Thro' the phantom-peopled sky, And the still voice bid this mortal Put on immortality. Thence we turned, what time the blackbird Pipes to vespers from his perch, And from out the clattering city Pass'd into the silent church; Mark'd the shower of sunlight breaking Thro' the crimson panes o'erhead, And on pictured wall and window Read the histories of the dead: Till the kneelers round us, rising, Crossed their foreheads and were gone; And o'er aisle and arch and cornice, Layer on layer, the night came on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARADES I [She stood at Greenwich, motionless amid] She stood at Greenwich, motionless amid The ever-shifting crowd of passengers. I mark'd a big tear quivering on the lid Of her deep-lustrous eye, and knew that hers Were days of bitterness. But, “Oh! what stirs,” I said, “such storm within so fair a breast?” Even as I spoke, two apoplectic curs Came feebly up: with one wild cry she prest Each singly to her heart, and faltered, “Heaven be blest!” Yet once again I saw her, from the deck Of a black ship that steamed towards Blackwall. She walked upon my first. Her stately neck Bent o'er an object shrouded in her shawl: I could not see the tears—the glad tears—fall, Yet knew they fell. And “Ah,” I said, “not puppies, Seen unexpectedly, could lift the pall From hearts who know what tasting misery's cup is As Niobe's, or mine, or blighted William Guppy's.” Spake John Grogblossom the coachman to Eliza Spinks the cook: “Mrs. Spinks,” says he, “I've founder'd: 'Liza dear, I'm overtook. Druv into a corner reglar, puzzled as a babe unborn; Speak the word, my blessed 'Liza; speak, and John the coachman's yourn.” Then Eliza Spinks made answer, blushing, to the coachman John: “John, I'm born and bred a spinster: I've begun and I'll go on. Endless cares and endless worrits, well I knows it, has a wife: Cooking for a genteel family, John, it's a goluptious life! “I gets £20 per annum—tea and things o'course not reckoned,— There's a cat that eats the butter, takes the coals, and breaks my second: There's soci'ty—James the footman;—(not that I look after him; But he's aff'ble in his manners, with amazing length of limb;)— “Never durst the missis enter here until I've said ‘Come in’: If I saw the master peeping, I'd catch up the rolling-pin. Christmas-boxes, that's a something; perkisites, that's something too; And I think, take all together, John, I won't be on with you.” John the coachman took his hat up, for he thought he'd had enough; Rubb'd an elongated forehead with a meditative cuff; Paused before the stable doorway; said, when there, in accents mild, “She's a fine young 'oman, cook is; but that's where it is, she's spiled.” I have read in some not marvellous tale, (Or if I have not, I've dreamed) Of one who filled up the convivial cup Till the company round him seemed To be vanished and gone, tho' the lamps upon Their face as aforetime gleamed: And his head sunk down, and a Lethe crept O'er his powerful brain, and the young man slept. Then they laid him with care in his moonlit bed: But first—having thoughtfully fetched some tar— Adorn'd him with feathers, aware that the weather's Uncertainty brings on at nights catarrh. They staid in his room till the sun was high: But still did the feathered one give no sign Of opening a peeper—he might be a sleeper Such as rests on the Northern or Midland line. At last he woke, and with profound Bewilderment he gazed around; Dropped one, then both feet to the ground, But never spake a word: Then to my whole he made his way; Took one long lingering survey; And softly, as he stole away, Remarked, “By Jove, a bird!” II [If you've seen a short man swagger tow'rds the footlights at Shoreditch] If you've seen a short man swagger tow'rds the footlights at Shoreditch, Sing out “Heave aho! my hearties,” and perpetually hitch Up, by an ingenious movement, trousers innocent of brace, Briskly flourishing a cudgel in his pleased companion's face; If he preluded with hornpipes each successive thing he did, From a sun-browned cheek extracting still an ostentatious quid; And expectorated freely, and occasionally cursed:— Then have you beheld, depicted by a master's hand, my first. O my countryman! if ever from thy arm the bolster sped, In thy school-days, with precision at a young companion's head; If 'twas thine to lodge the marble in the centre of the ring, Or with well-directed pebble make the sitting hen take wing: Then do thou—each fair May morning, when the blue lake is as glass, And the gossamers are twinkling star-like in the beaded grass; When the mountain-bee is sipping fragrance from the bluebell's lip, And the bathing-woman tells you, “Now's your time to take a dip”: When along the misty valleys fieldward winds the lowing herd, And the early worm is being dropped on by the early bird; And Aurora hangs her jewels from the bending rose's cup, And the myriad voice of Nature calls thee to my second up:— Hie thee to the breezy common, where the melancholy goose Stalks, and the astonished donkey finds that he is really loose; There amid green fern and furze-bush shalt thou soon my whole behold, Rising “bull-eyed and majestic”—as Olympus' queen of old: Kneel,—at a respectful distance,—as they kneeled to her, and try With judicious hand to put a ball into that ball-less eye: Till a stiffness seize thy elbows, and the general public wake— Then return, and, clear of conscience, walk into thy well-earned steak. III [ERE yet “knowledge for the million”] ERE yet “knowledge for the million” Came out “neatly bound in boards”; When like Care upon a pillion Matrons rode behind their lords: Rarely, save to hear the Rector, Forth did younger ladies roam; Making pies, and brewing nectar From the gooseberry-trees at home. They'd not dreamed of Pau or Vevay; Ne'er should into blossom burst At the ball or at the levée; Never come, in fact, my first: Nor illumine cards by dozens With some labyrinthine text, Nor work smoking-caps for cousins Who were pounding at my next. Now have skirts, and minds, grown ampler; Now not all they seek to do Is create upon a sampler Beasts which Buffon never knew: But their venturous muslins rustle O'er the cragstone and the snow, Or at home their biceps muscle Grows by practising the bow. Worthy they those dames who, fable Says, rode “palfreys” to the war With some giant Thane, whose “sable Destrier caracoled” before; Smiled, as—springing from the war-horse As men spring in modern “cirques”— He plunged, ponderous as a four-horse Coach, among the vanished Turks:— In the good times when the jester Asked the monarch how he was, And the landlady addrest her Guests as “gossip” or as “coz”; When the Templar said, “Gramercy,” Or, “'Twas shrewdly thrust, i' fegs,” To Sir Halbert or Sir Percy As they knocked him off his legs: And, by way of mild reminders That he needed coin, the Knight Day by day extracted grinders From the howling Israelite: And my whole in merry Sherwood Sent, with preterhuman luck, Missiles—not of steel but firwood— Thro' the two-mile-distant buck. IV [Evening threw soberer hue] Evening threw soberer hue Over the blue sky, and the few Poplars that grew just in the view Of the Hall of Sir Hugo de Wynkle: “Answer me true,” pleaded Sir Hugh, (Striving some hardhearted maiden to woo,) “What shall I do, Lady, for you? 'Twill be done, ere your eye may twinkle. Shall I borrow the wand of a Moorish enchanter, And bid a decanter contain the Levant, or The brass from the face of a Mormonite ranter? Shall I go for the mule of the Spanish Infantar— (That r, for the sake of the line, we must grant her,)— And race with the foul fiend, and beat in a canter, Like that first of equestrians Tam o' Shanter? I talk not mere banter—say not that I can't, or By this my first—(a Virginia planter Sold it me to kill rats)—I will die instanter.” The Lady bended her ivory neck, and Whispered mournfully, “Go for—my second.” She said, and the red from Sir Hugh's cheek fled, And “Nay,” did he say, as he stalked away The fiercest of injured men: “Twice have I humbled my haughty soul, And on bended knee have I pressed my whole— But I never will press it again!” V [On pinnacled St. Mary's] On pinnacled St. Mary's Lingers the setting sun; Into the streets the blackguards Are skulking one by one: Butcher and Boots and Bargeman Lay pipe and pewter down; And with wild shout come tumbling out To join the Town and Gown. And now the undergraduates Come forth by twos and threes, From the broad tower of Trinity, From the green gate of Caius: The wily bargeman marks them, And swears to do his worst; To turn to impotence their strength, And their beauty to my first. But before Corpus gateway My second first arose, When Barnacles the Freshman Was pinned upon the nose: Pinned on the nose by Boxer, Who brought a hobnailed herd From Barnwell, where he kept a van, Being indeed a dogsmeat man, Vendor of terriers, blue or tan, And dealer in my third. 'Twere long to tell how Boxer Was “countered” on the cheek, And knocked into the middle Of the ensuing week: How Barnacles the Freshman Was asked his name and college; And how he did the fatal facts Reluctantly acknowledge. He called upon the Proctor Next day at half-past ten; Men whispered that the Freshman cut A different figure then:— That the brass forsook his forehead, The iron fled his soul, As with blanched lip and visage wan Before the stony-hearted Don He kneeled upon my whole. VI [Sikes, housebreaker, of Houndsditch] Sikes, housebreaker, of Houndsditch, Habitually swore; But so surpassingly profane He never was before, As on a night in winter, When—softly as he stole In the dim light from stair to stair, Noiseless as boys who in her lair Seek to surprise a fat old hare— He barked his shinbone, unaware Encountering my whole. As pours the Anio plainward, When rains have swollen the dykes, So, with such noise, poured down my first Stirred by the shins of Sikes. The Butler Bibulus heard it; And straightway ceased to snore, And sat up, like an egg on end, While men might count a score: Then spake he to Tigerius, A Buttons bold was he: “Buttons, I think there's thieves about; Just strike a light and tumble out; If you can't find one go without, And see what you may see.” But now was all the household, Almost, upon its legs, Each treading carefully about As if they trod on eggs. With robe far-streaming issued Paterfamilias forth; And close behind him,—stout and true And tender as the North,— Came Mrs. P., supporting On her broad arm her fourth. Betsy the nurse, who never From largest beetle ran, And—conscious p'raps of pleasing caps— The housemaids, formed the van: And Bibulus the butler, His calm brows slightly arched; (No mortal wight had ere that night Seen him with shirt unstarched;) And Bob the shockhaired knifeboy, Wielding two Sheffield blades, And James Plush of the sinewy legs, The love of lady's maids: And charwoman and chaplain Stood mingled in a mass, And “Things,” thought he of Houndsditch, “Is come to a pretty pass.” Beyond all things a baby Is to the schoolgirl dear; Next to herself the nursemaid loves Her dashing grenadier; Only with life the sailor Parts from the British flag; While one hope lingers, the cracksman's fingers Drop not his hard-earned swag. But, as hares do my second Thro' green Calabria's copses, As females vanish at the sight Of short-horns and of wopses; So, dropping forks and teaspoons, The pride of Houndsditch fled, Dumbfoundered by the hue and cry He'd raised up overhead. They gave him—did the judges— As much as was his due. And, Saxon, shouldst thou e'er be led To deem this tale untrue; Then—any night in winter, When the cold north wind blows, And bairns are told to keep out cold By tallowing the nose: When round the fire the elders Are gathered in a bunch, And the girls are doing crochet, And the boys are reading Punch:— Go thou and look in Leech's book; There haply shalt thou spy A stout man on a staircase stand, With aspect anything but bland, And rub his right shin with his hand, To witness if I lie. PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY Introductory ART thou beautiful, O my daughter, as the budding rose of April? Are all thy motions music, and is poetry throned in thine eye? Then hearken unto me; and I will make the bud a fair flower, I will plant it upon the bank of Elegance, and water it with the water of Cologne; And in the season it shall “come out,” yea bloom, the pride of the parterre; Ladies shall marvel at its beauty, and a Lord shall pluck it at the last. Of Propriety Study first Propriety: for she is indeed the Polestar Which shall guide the artless maiden through the mazes of Vanity Fair; Nay, she is the golden chain which holdeth together Society; The lamp by whose light young Psyche shall approach unblamed her Eros. Verily Truth is as Eve, which was ashamed being naked; Wherefore doth Propriety dress her with the fair foliage of artifice: And when she is drest, behold! she knoweth not herself again.— I walked in the Forest; and above me stood the Yew, Stood like a slumbering giant, shrouded in impenetrable shade; Then I pass'd into the citizen's garden, and marked a tree clipt into shape, (The giant's locks had been shorn by the Dalilah-shears of Decorum;) And I said, “Surely Nature is goodly; but how much goodlier is Art!” I heard the wild notes of the lark floating far over the blue sky, And my foolish heart went after him, and, lo! I blessed him as he rose; Foolish! for far better is the trained boudoir bullfinch, Which pipeth the semblance of a tune, and mechanically draweth up water: And the reinless steed of the desert, though his neck be clothed with thunder, Must yield to him that danceth and “moveth in the circles” at Astley's. For verily, O my daughter, the world is a masquerade, And God made thee one thing, that thou mightest make thyself another: A maiden's heart is as champagne, ever aspiring and struggling upwards, And it needed that its motions be checked by the silvered cork of Propriety: He that can afford the price, his be the precious treasure, Let him drink deeply of its sweetness, nor grumble if it tasteth of the cork. Of Friendship Choose judiciously thy friends; for to discard them is undesirable, Yet it is better to drop thy friends, O my daughter, than to drop thy H's. Dost thou know a wise woman? yea, wiser than the children of light? Hath she a position? and a title? and are her parties in the Morning Post? If thou dost, cleave unto her, and give up unto her thy body and mind; Think with her ideas, and distribute thy smiles at her bidding: So shalt thou become like unto her; and thy manners shall be “formed,” And thy name shall be a Sesame, at which the doors of the great shall fly open: Thou shalt know every Peer, his arms, and the date of his creation, His pedigree and their intermarriages, and cousins to the sixth remove: Thou shalt kiss the hand of Royalty, and lo! in next morning's papers, Side by side with rumours of wars, and stories of shipwrecks and sieges, Shall appear thy name, and the minutiæ of thy head-dress and petticoat, For an enraptured public to muse upon over their matutinal muffin. Of Reading Read not Milton, for he is dry; nor Shakespeare, for he wrote of common life: Nor Scott, for his romances, though fascinating, are yet intelligible: Nor Thackeray, for he is a Hogarth, a photographer who flattereth not: Nor Kingsley, for he shall teach thee that thou shouldest not dream, but do. Read incessantly thy Burke; that Burke who, nobler than he of old, Treateth of the Peer and Peeress, the truly Sublime and Beautiful: Likewise study the “creations” of “the Prince of modern Romance;” Sigh over Leonard the Martyr, and smile on Pelham the puppy: Learn how “love is the dram-drinking of existence;” And how we “invoke, in the Gadara of our still closets, The beautiful ghost of the Ideal, with the simple wand of the pen.” Listen how Maltravers and the orphan “forgot all but love,” And how Devereux's family chaplain “made and unmade kings:” How Eugene Aram, though a thief, a liar, and a murderer, Yet, being intellectual, was amongst the noblest of mankind. So shalt thou live in a world peopled with heroes and master-spirits; And if thou canst not realize the Ideal, thou shalt at least idealize the Real.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FLY LEAVES MORNING 'Tis the hour when white-horsed Day Chases Night her mares away; When the Gates of Dawn (they say) Phœbus opes: And I gather that the Queen May be uniformly seen, Should the weather be serene, On the slopes. When the ploughman, as he goes Leathern-gaitered o'er the snows, From his hat and from his nose Knocks the ice; And the panes are frosted o'er And the lawn is crisp and hoar, As has been observed before Once or twice. When arrayed in breastplate red Sings the robin, for his bread, On the elmtree that hath shed Every leaf; While, within, the frost benumbs The still sleepy schoolboy's thumbs, And in consequence his sums Come to grief. But when breakfast-time hath come, And he's crunching crust and crumb, He'll no longer look a glum Little dunce; But be brisk as bees that settle On a summer rose's petal: Wherefore, Polly, put the kettle On at once. EVENING Kate! if e'er thy light foot lingers On the lawn, when up the fells Steals the Dark, and fairy fingers Close unseen the pimpernels: When, his thighs with sweetness laden, From the meadow comes the bee, And the lover and the maiden Stand beneath the trysting tree:— Lingers on, till stars unnumber'd Tremble in the breeze-swept tarn, And the bat that all day slumber'd Flits about the lonely barn; And the shapes that shrink from garish Noon are peopling cairn and lea; And thy sire is almost bearish If kept waiting for his tea:— And the screech-owl scares the peasant As he skirts some churchyard drear; And the goblins whisper pleasant Tales in Miss Rossetti's ear; Importuning her in strangest, Sweetest tones to buy their fruits:— O be careful that thou changest, On returning home, thy boots. SHELTER By the wide lake's margin I mark'd her lie— The wide, weird lake where the alders sigh— A young fair thing, with a shy, soft eye; And I deem'd that her thoughts had flown To her home, and her brethren, and sisters dear, As she lay there watching the dark, deep mere, All motionless, all alone. Then I heard a noise, as of men and boys, And a boisterous troop drew nigh. Whither now will retreat those fairy feet? Where hide till the storm pass by? One glance—the wild glance of a hunted thing— She cast behind her; she gave one spring; And there follow'd a splash and a broadening ring On the lake where the alders sigh. She had gone from the ken of ungentle men! Yet scarce did I mourn for that; For I knew she was safe in her own home then, And, the danger past, would appear again, For she was a water-rat. IN THE GLOAMING In the Gloaming to be roaming, where the crested waves are foaming, And the shy mermaidens combing locks that ripple to their feet; When the Gloaming is, I never made the ghost of an endeavour To discover—but whatever were the hour, it would be sweet. “To their feet,” I say, for Leech's sketch indisputably teaches That the mermaids of our beaches do not end in ugly tails, Nor have homes among the corals; but are shod with neat balmorals, An arrangement no one quarrels with, as many might with scales. Sweet to roam beneath a shady cliff, of course with some young lady, Lalage, Neæra, Haidee, or Elaine, or Mary Ann: Love, you dear delusive dream, you! Very sweet your victims deem you, When, heard only by the seamew, they talk all the stuff one can. Sweet to haste, a licensed lover, to Miss Pinkerton the glover, Having managed to discover what is dear Neæra's “size”: P'raps to touch that wrist so slender, as your tiny gift you tender, And to read you're no offender, in those laughing hazel eyes. Then to hear her call you “Harry,” when she makes you fetch and carry— O young men about to marry, what a blessed thing it is! To be photograph'd—together—cased in pretty Russia leather— Hear her gravely doubting whether they have spoilt your honest phiz! Then to bring your plighted fair one first a ring—a rich and rare one— Next a bracelet, if she'll wear one, and a heap of things beside; And serenely bending o'er her, to inquire if it would bore her To say when her own adorer may aspire to call her bride! Then, the days of courtship over, with your wife to start for Dover Or Dieppe—and live in clover evermore, whate'er befalls: For I've read in many a novel that, unless they've souls that grovel, Folks prefer in fact a hovel to your dreary marble halls: To sit, happy married lovers; Phillis trifling with a plover's Egg, while Corydon uncovers with a grace the Sally Lunn, Or dissects the lucky pheasant—that, I think, were passing pleasant; As I sit alone at present, dreaming darkly of a Dun. THE PALACE They come, they come, with fife and drum, And gleaming pikes and glancing banners. Though the eyes flash, the lips are dumb; To talk in rank would not be manners. Onward they stride, as Britons can; The ladies following in the Van. Who, who be these that tramp in threes Through sumptuous Piccadilly, through The roaring Strand, and stand at ease At last 'neath shadowy Waterloo? Some gallant Guild, I ween, are they; Taking their annual holiday. To catch the destin'd train—to pay Their willing fares, and plunge within it— Is, as in old Romaunt they say, With them the work of half-a-minute. Then off they're whirl'd, with songs and shouting, To cedared Sydenham for their outing. I mark'd them light, with faces bright As pansies or a new coin'd florin, And up the sunless stair take flight, Close-pack'd as rabbits in a warren. Honour the Brave, who in that stress Still trod not upon Beauty's dress! Kerchief in hand I saw them stand; In every kerchief lurk'd a lunch; When they unfurl'd them, it was grand To watch bronzed men and maidens crunch The sounding celery-stick, or ram The knife into the blushing ham. Dash'd the bold fork through pies of pork; O'er hard-boil'd eggs the saltspoon shook; Leapt from its lair the playful cork: Yet some there were, to whom the brook Seem'd sweetest beverage, and for meat They chose the red root of the beet. Then many a song, some rather long, Came quivering up from girlish throats; And one young man he came out strong, And gave “The Wolf” without his notes. While they who knew not song or ballad Still munch'd, approvingly, their salad. But ah! what bard could sing how hard, The artless banquet o'er, they ran Down the soft slope with daisies starr'd And kingcups! onward, maid with man, They flew, to scale the breezy swing, Or court frank kisses in the ring. Such are the sylvan scenes that thrill This heart! The lawns, the happy shade, Where matrons, whom the sunbeams grill, Stir with slow spoon their lemonade; And maidens flirt (no extra charge) In comfort at the fountain's marge! Others may praise the “grand displays” Where “fiery arch,” “cascade,” and “comet,” Set the whole garden in a “blaze”! Far, at such times, may I be from it; Though then the public may be “lost In wonder” at a trifling cost. Fann'd by the breeze, to puff at ease My faithful pipe is all I crave: And if folks rave about the “trees Lit up by fireworks,” let them rave. Your monster fêtes, I like not these; Though they bring grist to the lessees. PEACE A STUDY He stood, a worn-out City clerk— Who'd toil'd, and seen no holiday, For forty years from dawn to dark— Alone beside Caermarthen Bay. He felt the salt spray on his lips; Heard children's voices on the sands; Up the sun's path he saw the ships Sail on and on to other lands; And laugh'd aloud. Each sight and sound To him was joy too deep for tears; He sat him on the beach, and bound A blue bandana round his ears, And thought how, posted near his door, His own green door on Camden Hill, Two bands at least, most likely more, Were mingling at their own sweet will Verdi with Vance. And at the thought He laugh'd again, and softly drew That Morning Herald that he'd bought Forth from his breast, and read it through. THE ARAB ON, on, my brown Arab, away, away! Thou hast trotted o'er many a mile to-day, And I trow right meagre hath been thy fare Since they roused thee at dawn from thy straw-piled lair, To tread with those echoless unshod feet Yon weltering flats in the noontide heat, Where no palmtree proffers a kindly shade And the eye never rests on a cool grass blade; And lank is thy flank, and thy frequent cough Oh! it goes to my heart—but away, friend, off! And yet, ah! what sculptor who saw thee stand, As thou standest now, on thy Native Strand, With the wild wind ruffling thine uncomb'd hair, And thy nostril upturn'd to the od'rous air, Would not woo thee to pause till his skill might trace At leisure the lines of that eager face; The collarless neck and the coal-black paws And the bit grasp'd tight in the massive jaws; The delicate curve of the legs, that seem Too slight for their burden—and, O, the gleam Of that eye, so sombre and yet so gay! Still away, my lithe Arab, once more away! Nay, tempt me not, Arab, again to stay; Since I crave neither Echo nor Fun to-day. For thy hand is not Echoless—there they are— Fun, Glowworm, and Echo, and Evening Star: And thou hintest withal that thou fain would'st shine, As I con them, these bulgy old boots of mine. But I shrink from thee, Arab! Thou eat'st eel-pie, Thou evermore hast at least one black eye; There is brass on thy brow, and thy swarthy hues Are due not to nature but handling shoes; And the bit in thy mouth, I regret to see, Is a bit of tobacco-pipe—Flee, child, flee! LINES ON HEARING THE ORGAN Grinder, who serenely grindest At my door the Hundredth Psalm, Till thou ultimately findest Pence in thy unwashen palm: Grinder, jocund-hearted Grinder, Near whom Barbary's nimble son, Poised with skill upon his hinder Paws, accepts the proffered bun: Dearly do I love thy grinding; Joy to meet thee on thy road Where thou prowlest through the blinding Dust with that stupendous load, 'Neath the baleful star of Sirius, When the postmen slowlier jog, And the ox becomes delirious, And the muzzle decks the dog. Tell me by what art thou bindest On thy feet those ancient shoon: Tell me, Grinder, if thou grindest Always, always out of tune. Tell me if, as thou art buckling On thy straps with eager claws, Thou forecastest, inly chuckling, All the rage that thou wilt cause. Tell me if at all thou mindest When folks flee, as if on wings, From thee as at ease thou grindest: Tell me fifty thousand things. Grinder, gentle-hearted Grinder! Ruffians who lead evil lives, Soothed by thy sweet strains, are kinder To their bullocks and their wives: Children, when they see thy supple Form approach, are out like shots Half-a-bar sets several couple Waltzing in convenient spots; Not with clumsy Jacks or Georges Unprofaned by grasp of man Maidens speed those simple orgies, Betsey Jane with Betsey Ann. As they love thee in St. Giles's Thou art loved in Grosvenor Square: None of those engaging smiles is Unreciprocated there. Often, ere yet thou hast hammer'd Through thy four delicious airs, Coins are flung thee by enamour'd Housemaids upon area stairs: E'en the ambrosial-whisker'd flunkey Eyes thy boots and thine unkempt Beard and melancholy monkey More in pity than contempt. Far from England, in the sunny South, where Anio leaps in foam, Thou wast rear'd, till lack of money Drew thee from thy vineclad home: And thy mate, the sinewy Jocko, From Brazil or Afric came, Land of simoom and sirocco— And he seems extremely tame. There he quaff'd the undefilèd Spring, or hung with apelike glee, By his teeth or tail or eyelid, To the slippery mango-tree: There he woo'd and won a dusky Bride, of instincts like his own; Talk'd of love till he was husky In a tongue to us unknown: Side by side 'twas theirs to ravage The potato ground, or cut Down the unsuspecting savage With the well-aim'd cocoa-nut:— Till the miscreant Stranger tore him Screaming from his blue-faced fair; And they flung strange raiment o'er him, Raiment which he could not bear: Sever'd from the pure embraces Of his children and his spouse, He must ride fantastic races Mounted on reluctant sows: But the heart of wistful Jocko Still was with his ancient flame In the nutgroves of Morocco; Or if not it's all the same. Grinder, winsome grinsome Grinder! They who see thee and whose soul Melts not at thy charms, are blinder Than a trebly-bandaged mole: They to whom thy curt (yet clever) Talk, thy music and thine ape, Seem not to be joys for ever, Are but brutes in human shape. 'Tis not that thy mien is stately, 'Tis not that thy tones are soft; 'Tis not that I care so greatly For the same thing play'd so oft: But I've heard mankind abuse thee; And perhaps it's rather strange, But I thought that I would choose thee For encomium, as a change. CHANGED I know not why my soul is rack'd: Why I ne'er smile as was my wont: I only know that, as a fact, I don't. I used to roam o'er glen and glade Buoyant and blithe as other folk: And not unfrequently I made A joke. A minstrel's fire within me burn'd. I'd sing, as one whose heart must break, Lay upon lay: I nearly learn'd To shake. All day I sang; of love, of fame, Of fights our fathers fought of yore, Until the thing almost became A bore. I cannot sing the old songs now! It is not that I deem them low; 'Tis that I can't remember how They go. I could not range the hills till high Above me stood the summer moon: And as to dancing, I could fly As soon. The sports, to which with boyish glee I sprang erewhile, attract no more; Although I am but sixty-three Or four. Nay, worse than that, I've seem'd of late To shrink from happy boyhood—boys Have grown so noisy, and I hate A noise. They fright me, when the beech is green, By swarming up its stem for eggs: They drive their horrid hoops between My legs:— It's idle to repine, I know; I'll tell you what I'll do instead: I'll drink my arrowroot, and go To bed. FIRST LOVE O my earliest love, who, ere I number'd Ten sweet summers, made my bosom thrill! Will a swallow—or a swift, or some bird— Fly to her and say, I love her still? Say my life's a desert drear and arid, To its one green spot I aye recur: Never, never—although three times married— Have I cared a jot for aught but her. No, mine own! though early forced to leave you, Still my heart was there where first we met; In those “Lodgings with an ample sea-view,” Which were, forty years ago, “To Let.” There I saw her first, our landlord's oldest Little daughter. On a thing so fair Thou, O Sun,—who (so they say) beholdest Everything,—hast gazed, I tell thee, ne'er. There she sat—so near me, yet remoter Than a star—a blue-eyed bashful imp: On her lap she held a happy bloater, 'Twixt her lips a yet more happy shrimp. And I loved her, and our troth we plighted On the morrow by the shingly shore: In a fortnight to be disunited By a bitter fate for evermore. O my own, my beautiful, my blue-eyed! To be young once more, and bite my thumb At the world and all its cares with you, I'd Give no inconsiderable sum. Hand in hand we tramp'd the golden seaweed, Soon as o'er the gray cliff peep'd the dawn: Side by side, when came the hour for tea, we'd Crunch the mottled shrimp and hairy prawn:— Has she wedded some gigantic shrimper, That sweet mite with whom I loved to play? Is she girt with babes that whine and whimper, That bright being who was always gay? Yes—she has at least a dozen wee things! Yes—I see her darning corduroys, Scouring floors, and setting out the tea-things, For a howling herd of hungry boys, In a home that reeks of tar and sperm-oil! But at intervals she thinks, I know, Of those days which we, afar from turmoil, Spent together forty years ago. O my earliest love, still unforgotten, With your downcast eyes of dreamy blue! Never, somehow, could I seem to cotton To another as I did to you! WANDERERS As o'er the hill we roam'd at will, My dog and I together, We mark'd a chaise, by two bright bays Slow-moved along the heather: Two bays arch neck'd, with tails erect And gold upon their blinkers; And by their side an ass I spied; It was a travelling tinker's. The chaise went by, nor aught cared I; Such things are not in my way; I turn'd me to the tinker, who Was loafing down a by-way: I ask'd him where he lived—a stare Was all I got in answer, As on he trudged: I rightly judged The stare said, “Where I can, sir.” I ask'd him if he'd take a whiff Of 'bacco; he acceded; He grew communicative too, (A pipe was all he needed,) Till of the tinker's life, I think, I knew as much as he did. “I loiter down by thorp and town, For any job I'm willing; Take here and three a dusty brown, And here and there a shilling. “I deal in every ware in turn, I've rings for buddin' Sally That sparkle like those eyes of her'n; I've liquor for the valet. “I steal from th' parson's strawberry-plots, I hide by th' squire's covers; I teach the sweet young housemaids what's The art of trapping lovers. “The things I've done 'neath moon and stars Have got me into messes: I've seen the sky through prison bars, I've torn up prison dresses: “I've sat, I've sigh'd, I've gloom'd, I've glanced With envy at the swallows That through the window slid, and danced (Quite happy) round the gallows; “But out again I come, and show My face nor care a stiver For trades are brisk and trades are slow, But mine goes on for ever.” Thus on he prattled like a babbling brook. Then I, “The sun hath slipt behind the hill, And my aunt Vivian dines at half-past six.” So in all love we parted; I to the Hall, They to the village. It was noised next noon That chickens had been miss'd at Syllabub Farm. SAD MEMORIES They tell me I am beautiful: they praise my silken hair, My little feet that silently slip on from stair to stair: They praise my pretty trustful face and innocent gray eye; Fond hands caress me oftentimes, yet would that I might die! Why was I born to be abhorr'd of man and bird and beast? The bullfinch marks me stealing by, and straight his song hath ceased; The shrewmouse eyes me shudderingly, then flees; and, worse than that, The housedog he flees after me—why was I born a cat? Men prize the heartless hound who quits dried-eyed his native land; Who wags a mercenary tail and licks a tyrant hand. The leal true cat they prize not, that if e'er compell'd to roam Still flies, when let out of the bag, precipitately home. They call me cruel. Do I know if mouse or song-bird feels? I only know they make me light and salutary meals: And if, as 'tis my nature to, ere I devour I tease 'em, Why should a low-bred gardener's boy pursue me with a besom? Should china fall or chandeliers, or anything but stocks— Nay stocks, when they're in flowerpots—the cat expects hard knocks: Should ever anything be missed—milk, coals, umbrellas, brandy— The cat's pitched into with a boot or any thing that's handy. “I remember, I remember,” how one night I “fleeted by,” And gain'd the blessed tiles and gazed into the cold clear sky. “I remember, I remember, how my little lovers came;” And there, beneath the crescent moon, play'd many a little game. They fought—by good St. Catharine, 'twas a fearsome sight to see The coal-black crest, the glowering orbs, of one gigantic He. Like bow by some tall bowman bent at Hastings or Poictiers, His huge back curved, till none observed a vestige of his ears: He stood, an ebon crescent, flouting that ivory moon; Then raised the pibroch of his race, the Song without a Tune; Gleam'd his white teeth, his mammoth tail waved darkly to and fro, As with one complex yell he burst, all claws, upon the foe. It thrills me now, that final Miaow—that wierd unearthly din: Lone maidens heard it far away, and leap'd out of their skin. A potboy from his den o'erhead peep'd with a scared wan face; Then sent a random brickbat down, which knock'd me into space. Nine days I fell, or thereabouts: and, had we not nine lives, I wis I ne'er had seen again thy sausage-shop, St. Ives! Had I, as some cats have, nine tails, how gladly I would lick The hand, and person generally, of him who heaved that brick! For me they fill the milkbowl up, and cull the choice sardine: But ah! I nevermore shall be the cat I once have been! The memories of that fatal night they haunt me even now: In dreams I see that rampant He, and tremble at that Miaow. COMPANIONS A TALE OF A GRANDFATHER By the Author of “Dewy Memories,” &amp;c. I know not of what we ponder'd Or made pretty pretence to talk, As, her hand within mine, we wander'd Tow'rd the pool by the limetree walk, While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers And the blush-rose bent on her stalk. I cannot recall her figure: Was it regal as Juno's own? Or only a trifle bigger Than the elves who surround the throne Of the Faëry Queen, and are seen, I ween, By mortals in dreams alone? What her eyes were like, I know not: Perhaps they were blurr'd with tears; And perhaps in your skies there glow not (On the contrary) clearer spheres. No! as to her eyes I am just as wise As you or the cat, my dears. Her teeth, I presume, were “pearly”: But which was she, brunette or blonde? Her hair, was it quaintly curly, Or as straight as a beadle's wand? That I fail'd to remark;—it was rather dark And shadowy round the pond. Then the hand that reposed so snugly In mine—was it plump or spare? Was the countenance fair or ugly? Nay, children, you have me there! My eyes were p'raps blurr'd; and besides I'd heard That it's horribly rude to stare. And I—was I brusque and surly? Or oppressively bland and fond? Was I partial to rising early? Or why did we twain abscond, All breakfastless too, from the public view To prowl by a misty pond? What pass'd, what was felt or spoken— Whether anything pass'd at all— And whether the heart was broken That beat under that shelt'ring shawl— (If shawl she had on, which I doubt)—has gone, Yes, gone from me past recall. Was I haply the lady's suitor? Or her uncle? I can't make out— Ask your governess, dears, or tutor. For myself, I'm in hopeless doubt As to why we were there, who on earth we were, And what this is all about. BALLAD [The auld wife sat at her ivied door] [[Part I]] The auld wife sat at her ivied door, (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) A thing she had frequently done before; And her spectacles lay on her apron'd knees. The piper he piped on the hill-top high, (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) Till the cow said “I die,” and the goose ask'd “Why?” And the dog said nothing, but search'd for fleas. The farmer he strode through the square farmyard; (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) His last brew of ale was a trifle hard— The connexion of which with the plot one sees. The farmer's daughter hath frank blue eyes; (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) She hears the rooks caw in the windy skies, As she sits at her lattice and shells her peas. The farmer's daughter hath ripe red lips; (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) If you try to approach her, away she skips Over tables and chairs with apparent ease. The farmer's daughter hath soft brown hair (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) And I met with a ballad, I can't say where, Which wholly consisted of lines like these. Part II She sat with her hands 'neath her dimpled cheeks, (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) And spake not a word. While a lady speaks There is hope, but she didn't even sneeze. She sat, with her hands 'neath her crimson cheeks; (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) She gave up mending her father's breeks, And let the cat roll in her new chemise. She sat, with her hands 'neath her burning cheeks, (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) And gazed at the piper for thirteen weeks; Then she follow'd him out o'er the misty leas. Her sheep follow'd her, as their tails did them. (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese) And this song is consider'd a perfect gem, And as to the meaning, it's what you please. PRECIOUS STONES AN INCIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY My Cherrystones! I prize them, No tongue can tell how much! Each lady caller eyes them, And madly longs to touch! At eve I lift them down, I look Upon them, and I cry; Recalling how my Prince “partook” (Sweet word!) of cherry-pie! To me it was an Era In life, that Dejeuner! They ate, they sipp'd Madeira Much in the usual way. Many a soft item there would be, No doubt, upon the carte: But one made life a heaven to me: It was the cherry-tart. Lightly the spoonfuls enter'd That mouth on which the gaze Of ten fair girls was centred In rapturous amaze. Soon that august assemblage clear'd The dish; and—as they ate— The stones, all coyly, re-appear'd On each illustrious plate. And when His Royal Highness Withdrew to take the air, Waiving our natural shyness, We swoop'd upon his chair. Policemen at our garments clutch'd: We mock'd those feeble powers; And soon the treasures that had touch'd Exalted lips were ours! One large one—at the moment It seem'd almost divine— Was got by that Miss Beaumont: And three, O three, are mine! Yes! the three stones that rest beneath Glass, on that plain deal shelf, Stranger, once dallied with the teeth Of Royalty itself. Let Parliament abolish Churches and States and Thrones: With reverent hand I'll polish Still, still my Cherrystones! A clod—a piece of orange-peel— An end of a cigar— Once trod on by a Princely heel, How beautiful they are! Years since, I climb'd Saint Michael His Mount:—you'll all go there Of course, and those who like'll Sit in Saint Michael's Chair: For there I saw, within a frame, The pen—O heavens! the pen— With which a Duke had signed his name, And other gentlemen. “Great among geese,” I faltered, “Is she who grew that quill!” And, Deathless Bird, unalter'd Is mine opinion still. Yet sometimes, as I view my three Stones with a thoughtful brow, I think there possibly might be E'en greater geese than thou. DISASTER 'Twas ever thus from childhood's hour! My fondest hopes would not decay: I never loved a tree or flower Which was the first to fade away! The garden, where I used to delve Short-frock'd, still yields me pinks in plenty: The peartree that I climb'd at twelve I see still blossoming, at twenty. I never nursed a dear gazelle; But I was given a parroquet— (How I did nurse him if unwell!) He's imbecile, but lingers yet. He's green, with an enchanting tuft; He melts me with his small black eye: He'd look inimitable stuff'd, And knows it—but he will not die! I had a kitten—I was rich In pets—but all too soon my kitten Became a full-sized cat, by which I've more than once been scratch'd and bitten. And when for sleep her limbs she curl'd One day beside her untouch'd plateful, And glided calmly from the world, I freely own that I was grateful. And then I bought a dog—a queen! Ah Tiny, dear departing pug! She lives, but she is past sixteen And scarce can crawl across the rug. I loved her beautiful and kind; Delighted in her pert Bow-wow: But now she snaps if you don't mind; 'Twere lunacy to love her now. I used to think, should e'er mishap Betide my crumple-visaged Ti, In shape of prowling thief, or trap, Or coarse bull-terrier—I should die. But ah! disasters have their use; And life might e'en be too sunshiny: Nor would I make myself a goose, If some big dog should swallow Tiny. CONTENTMENT AFTER THE MANNER OF HORACE Friend, there be they on whom mishap Or never or so rarely comes, That, when they think thereof, they snap Derisive thumbs: And there be they who lightly lose Their all, yet feel no aching void; Should aught annoy them, they refuse To be annoy'd: And fain would I be e'en as these! Life is with such all beer and skittles; They are not difficult to please About their victuals: The trout, the grouse, the early pea, By such, if there, are freely taken; If not, they munch with equal glee Their bit of bacon: And when they wax a little gay And chaff the public after luncheon, If they're confronted with a stray Policeman's truncheon, They gaze thereat with outstretch'd necks, And laughter which no threats can smother, And tell the horror-stricken X That he's another. In snowtime if they cross a spot Where unsuspected boys have slid, They fall not down—though they would not Mind if they did: When the spring rosebud which they wear Breaks short and tumbles from its stem, No thought of being angry e'er Dawns upon them; Though 'twas Jemima's hand that placed, (As well you ween) at evening's hour, In the loved button-hole that chaste And cherish'd flower. And when they travel, if they find That they have left their pocket-compass Or Murray or thick boots behind, They raise no rumpus, But plod serenely on without: Knowing it's better to endure The evil which beyond all doubt You cannot cure. When for that early train they're late, They do not make their woes the text Of sermons in the Times, but wait On for the next; And jump inside, and only grin Should it appear that that dry wag, The guard, omitted to put in Their carpet-bag. THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD WITH HIS SON O what harper could worthily harp it, Mine Edward! this wide-stretching wold (Look out wold) with its wonderful carpet Of emerald, purple, and gold! Look well at it—also look sharp, it Is getting so cold. The purple is heather (erica); The yellow, gorse—call'd sometimes “whin.” Cruel boys on its prickles might spike a Green beetle as if on a pin. You may roll in it, if you would like a Few holes in your skin. You wouldn't? Then think of how kind you Should be to the insects who crave Your compassion—and then, look behind you At yon barley-ears! Don't they look brave As they undulate (undulate, mind you, From unda, a wave). The noise of those sheep-bells, how faint it Sounds here—(on account of our height)! And this hillock itself—who could paint it, With its changes of shadow and light? Is it not—(never, Eddy, say “ain't it”)— A marvellous sight? Then yon desolate eerie morasses, The haunts of the snipe and the hern— (I shall question the two upper classes On aquatiles, when we return)— Why, I see on them absolute masses Of filix or fern. How it interests e'en a beginner (Or tiro) like dear little Ned! Is he listening? As I am a sinner He's asleep—he is wagging his head. Wake up! I'll go home to my dinner, And you to your bed. The boundless ineffable prairie; The splendour of mountain and lake With their hues that seem ever to vary; The mighty pine-forests which shake In the wind, and in which the unwary May tread on a snake; And this wold with its heathery garment Are themes undeniably great. But—although there is not any harm in't— It's perhaps little good to dilate On their charms to a dull little varmint Of seven or eight. ARCADES AMBO Why are ye wandering aye 'twixt porch and porch, Thou and thy fellow—when the pale stars fade At dawn, and when the glowworm lights her torch, O Beadle of the Burlington Arcade? —Who asketh why the Beautiful was made? A wan cloud drifting o'er the waste of blue, The thistledown that floats above the glade, The lilac-blooms of April—fair to view, And naught but fair are these; and such, I ween, are you. Yes, ye are beautiful. The young street boys Joy in your beauty. Are ye there to bar Their pathway to that paradise of toys, Ribbons and rings? Who'll blame ye if ye are? Surely no shrill and clattering crowd should mar The dim aisle's stillness, where in noon's midglow Trip fair-hair'd girls to boot-shop or bazaar; Where, at soft eve, serenely to and fro The sweet boy-graduates walk, nor deem the pastime slow. And O! forgive me, Beadles, if I paid Scant tribute to your worth, when first ye stood Before me robed in broadcloth and brocade And all the nameless grace of Beadlehood! I would not smile at ye—if smile I could Now as erewhile, ere I had learn'd to sigh: Ah, no! I know ye beautiful and good, And evermore will pause as I pass by, And gaze, and gazing think, how base a thing am I. WAITING. “O come, O come,” the mother pray'd And hush'd her babe: “let me behold Once more thy stately form array'd Like autumn woods in green and gold! “I see thy brethren come and go; Thy peers in stature, and in hue Thy rivals. Some like monarchs glow With richest purple: some are blue “As skies that tempt the swallow back; Or red as, seen o'er wintry seas, The star of storm; or barr'd with black And yellow, like the April bees. “Come they and go! I heed not, I. Yet others hail their advent, cling All trustful to their side, and fly Safe in their gentle piloting “To happy homes on heath or hill, By park or river. Still I wait And peer into the darkness: still Thou com'st not—I am desolate. “Hush! hark! I see a towering form! From the dim distance slowly roll'd It rocks like lilies in a storm, And O, its hues are green and gold: “It comes, it comes! Ah rest is sweet, And there is rest, my babe, for us!” She ceased, as at her very feet Stopp'd the St. John's Wood omnibus. PLAY Play, play, while as yet it is day: While the sweet sunlight is warm on the brae! Hark to the lark singing lay upon lay, While the brown squirrel eats nuts on the spray, And in the apple-leaves chatters the jay! Play, play, even as they! What though the cowslips ye pluck will decay, What though the grass will be presently hay? What though the noise that ye make should dismay Old Mrs. Clutterbuck over the way? Play, play, for your locks will grow gray; Even the marbles ye sport with are clay. Play, ay in the crowded highway: Was it not made for you? Yea, my lad, yea. True that the babes you were bid to convey Home may fall out or be stolen or stray; True that the tip-cat you toss about may Strike an old gentleman, cause him to sway, Stumble, and p'raps be run o'er by a dray: Still why delay? Play, my son, play! Barclay and Perkins, not you, have to pay. Play, play, your sonatas in A, Heedless of what your next neighbour may say! Dance and be gay as a faun or a fay, Sing like the lad in the boat on the bay; Sing, play—if your neighbours inveigh Feebly against you, they're lunatics, eh? Bang, twang, clatter and clang, Strum, thrum, upon fiddle and drum; Neigh, bray, simply obey All your sweet impulses, stop not or stay! Rattle the “bones,” hit a tinbottom'd tray Hard with the fireshovel, hammer away! Is not your neighbour your natural prey? Should he confound you, it's only in play. LOVE Canst thou love me, lady? I've not learn'd to woo: Thou art on the shady Side of sixty too. Still I love thee dearly! Thou hast lands and pelf: But I love thee merely Merely for thyself. Wilt thou love me, fairest? Though thou art not fair; And I think thou wearest Someone-else's hair. Thou could'st love, though, dearly: And, as I am told, Thou art very nearly Worth thy weight, in gold. Dost thou love me, sweet one? Tell me that thou dost! Women fairly beat one, But I think thou must. Thou art loved so dearly: I am plain, but then Thou (to speak sincerely) Art as plain again. Love me, bashful fairy! I've an empty purse: And I've “moods,” which vary; Mostly for the worst. Still, I love thee dearly: Though I make (I feel) Love a little queerly, I'm as true as steel. Love me, swear to love me (As, you know, they do) By yon heaven above me And its changeless blue. Love me, lady, dearly, If you'll be so good; Though I don't see clearly On what ground you should. Love me—ah! or love me Not, but be my bride! Do not simply shove me (So to speak) aside! P'raps it would be dearly Purchased at the price; But a hundred yearly Would be very nice. THOUGHTS AT A RAILWAY STATION 'Tis but a box, of modest deal; Directed to no matter where: Yet down my cheek the teardrops steal— Yes, I am blubbering like a seal; For on it is this mute appeal, “With care.” I am a stern cold man, and range Apart: but those vague words “With care” Wake yearnings in me sweet as strange: Drawn from my moral Moated Grange, I feel I rather like the change Of air. Hast thou ne'er seen rough pointsmen spy Some simple English phrase—“With care” Or “This side uppermost”—and cry Like children? No? No more have I. Yet deem not him whose eyes are dry A bear. But ah! what treasure hides beneath That lid so much the worse for wear? A ring perhaps—a rosy wreath— A photograph by Vernon Heath— Some matron's temporary teeth Or hair! Perhaps some seaman, in Peru Or Ind, hath stow'd herein a rare Cargo of birds' eggs for his Sue; With many a vow that he'll be true, And many a hint that she is too, Too fair. Perhaps—but wherefore vainly pry Into the page that's folded there? I shall be better by and by: The porters, as I sit and sigh, Pass and repass—I wonder why They stare! ON THE BRINK I watch'd her as she stoop'd to pluck A wildflower in her hair to twine; And wish'd that it had been my luck To call her mine. Anon I heard her rate with mad Mad words her babe within its cot; And felt particularly glad That it had not. I knew (such subtle brains have men) That she was uttering what she shouldn't; And thought that I would chide, and then I thought I wouldn't: Who could have gazed upon that face, Those pouting coral lips, and chided? A Rhadamanthus, in my place, Had done as I did: For ire wherewith our bosoms glow Is chain'd there oft by Beauty's spell; And, more than that, I did not know The widow well. So the harsh phrase pass'd unreproved. Still mute—(O brothers, was it sin?)— I drank, unutterably moved, Her beauty in: And to myself I murmur'd low, As on her upturn'd face and dress The moonlight fell, “Would she say No, By chance, or Yes?” She stood so calm, so like a ghost Betwixt me and that magic moon, That I already was almost A finish'd coon. But when she caught adroitly up And soothed with smiles her little daughter; And gave it, if I'm right, a sup Of barley-water; And, crooning still the strange sweet lore Which only mothers' tongues can utter, Snow'd with deft hand the sugar o'er Its bread-and-butter; And kiss'd it clingingly—(Ah, why Don't women do these things in private?)— I felt that if I lost her, I Should not survive it: And from my mouth the words nigh flew— The past, the future, I forgat 'em: “Oh! if you'd kiss me as you do That thankless atom!” But this thought came ere yet I spake, And froze the sentence on my lips: “They err, who marry wives that make Those little slips.” It came like some familiar rhyme, Some copy to my boyhood set; And that's perhaps the reason I'm Unmarried yet. Would she have own'd how pleased she was, And told her love with widow's pride? I never found out that, because I never tried. Be kind to babes and beasts and birds: Hearts may be hard, though lips are coral; And angry words are angry words: And that's the moral. “FOREVER” Forever; 'tis a single word! Our rude forefathers deem'd it two: Can you imagine so absurd A view? Forever! What abysms of woe The word reveals, what frenzy, what Despair! For ever (printed so) Did not. It looks, ah me! how trite and tame! It fails to sadden or appal Or solace—it is not the same At all. O thou to whom it first occurr'd To solder the disjoin'd, and dower Thy native language with a word Of power: We bless thee! Whether far or near Thy dwelling, whether dark or fair Thy kingly brow, is neither here Nor there. But in men's hearts shall be thy throne, While the great pulse of England beats Thou coiner of a word unknown To Keats! And nevermore must printer do As men did longago; but run “For” into “ever,” bidding two Be one. Forever! passion-fraught, it throws O'er the dim page a gloom, a glamour: It's sweet, it's strange; and I suppose It's grammar. Forever! 'Tis a single word! And yet our fathers deem'd it two: Nor am I confident they err'd; Are you? UNDER THE TREES “Under the trees!” Who but agrees That there is magic in words such as these? Promptly one sees shake in the breeze Stately lime-avenues haunted of bees: Where, looking far over buttercupp'd leas, Lads and “fair shes” (that is Byron, and he's An authority) lie very much at their ease, Taking their teas, or their duck and green peas, Or, if they prefer it, their plain bread and cheese: Not objecting at all though it's rather a squeeze And the glass is, I daresay, at 80 degrees. Some get up glees, and are mad about Ries And Sainton, and Tamberlik's thrilling high Cs; Or if painters, hold forth upon Hunt and Maclise, And the tone and the breadth of that landscape of Lee's; Or if learned, on nodes and the moon's apogees, Or, if serious, on something of A.K.H.B.'s, Or the latest attempt to convert the Chaldees; Or in short about all things, from earthquakes to fleas. Some sit in twos or (less frequently) threes, With their innocent lambswool or book on their knees, And talk, and enact, any nonsense you please, As they gaze into eyes that are blue as the seas; And you hear an occasional “Harry, don't tease” From the sweetest of lips in the softest of keys, And other remarks, which to me are Chinese. And fast the time flees; till a ladylike sneeze, Or a portly papa's more elaborate wheeze, Makes Miss Tabitha seize on her brown muffatees, And announce as a fact that it's going to freeze, And that young people ought to attend to their Ps And their Qs, and not court every form of disease. Then Tommy eats up the three last ratafias, And pretty Louise wraps her robe de cerise Round a bosom as tender as Widow Machree's, And (in spite of the pleas of her lorn vis-à-vis) Goes to wrap up her uncle—a patient of Skey's, Who is prone to catch chills, like all old Bengalese:— But at bedtime I trust he'll remember to grease The bridge of his nose, and preserve his rupees From the premature clutch of his fond legatees; Or at least have no fees to pay any M. D.s For the cold his niece caught, sitting under the Trees. MOTHERHOOD She laid it where the sunbeams fall Unscann'd upon the broken wall. Without a tear, without a groan, She laid it near a mighty stone, Which some rude swain had haply cast Thither in sport, long ages past, And Time with mosses had o'erlaid, And fenced with many a tall grassblade, And all about bid roses bloom And violets shed their soft perfume. There, in its cool and quiet bed, She set her burden down and fled: Nor flung, all eager to escape, One glance upon the perfect shape That lay, still warm and fresh and fair, But motionless and soundless there. No human eye had mark'd her pass Across the linden-shadow'd grass Ere yet the minster clock chimed seven: Only the innocent birds of heaven— The magpie, and the rook whose nest Swings as the elmtree waves his crest— And the lithe cricket, and the hoar And huge-limb'd hound that guards the door, Look'd on when, as a summer wind That, passing, leaves no trace behind, All unapparell'd, barefoot all, She ran to that old ruin'd wall, To leave upon the chill dank earth (For ah! she never knew its worth) 'Mid hemlock rank, and fern, and ling, And dews of night, that precious thing! And there it might have lain forlorn From morn till eve, from eve to morn: But that, by some wild impulse led, The mother, ere she turn'd and fled, One moment stood erect and high; Then pour'd into the silent sky A cry so jubilant, so strange, That Alice—as she strove to range Her rebel ringlets at her glass— Sprang up and gazed across the grass; Shook back those curls so fair to see, Clapp'd her soft hands in childish glee; And shriek'd—her sweet face all aglow, Her very limbs with rapture shaking— “My hen has laid an egg, I know; And only hear the noise she's making!” MYSTERY I know not if in others' eyes She seem'd almost divine; But far beyond a doubt it lies That she did not in mine. Each common stone on which she trod I did not deem a pearl: Nay it is not a little odd How I abhorr'd that girl. We met at balls and picnics oft, Or on a drawingroom stair; My aunt invariably cough'd To warn me she was there: At croquet I was bid remark How queenly was her pose, As with stern glee she drew the dark Blue ball beneath her toes, And made the Red fly many a foot: Then calmly she would stoop, Smiling an angel smile, to put A partner through his hoop. At archery I was made observe That others aim'd more near, But none so tenderly could curve The elbow round the ear: Or if we rode, perhaps she did Pull sharply at the curb; But then the way in which she slid From horseback was superb! She'd throw off odes, again, whose flow And fire were more than Sapphic; Her voice was sweet, and very low; Her singing quite seraphic: She was a seraph, lacking wings, That much I freely own. But, it is one of those queer things Whose cause is all unknown— (Such are the wasp, the household fly, The shapes that crawl and curl By men called centipedes)—that I Simply abhorr'd that girl. No doubt some mystery underlies All things which are and which are not: And 'tis the function of the Wise Not to expound to us what is what, But let his consciousness play round The matter, and at ease evolve The problem, shallow or profound, Which our poor wits have fail'd to solve, Then tell us blandly we are fools; Whereof we were aware before: That truth they taught us at the schools, And p'raps (who knows?) a little more. —But why did we two disagree? Our tastes, it may be, did not dovetail; All I know is, we ne'er shall be Hero and heroine of a love-tale. FLIGHT O memory! that which I gave thee To guard in thy garner yestreen— Little deeming thou e'er could'st behave thee Thus basely—hath gone from thee clean! Gone, fled, as ere autumn is ended The yellow leaves flee from the oak— I have lost it for ever, my splendid Original joke. What was it? I know I was brushing My hair when the notion occurred: I know that I felt myself blushing As I thought, “How supremely absurd! How they'll hammer on floor and on table As its drollery dawns on them—how They will quote it”—I wish I were able To quote it just now. I had thought to lead up conversation To the subject—it's easily done— Then let off, as an airy creation Of the moment, that masterly pun. Let it off, with a flash like a rocket's; In the midst of a dazzled conclave, Where I sat, with my hands in my pockets, The only one grave. I had fancied young Titterton's chuckles, And old Bottleby's hearty guffaws As he drove at my ribs with his knuckles, His mode of expressing applause: While Jean Bottleby—queenly Miss Janet— Drew her handkerchief hastily out, In fits at my slyness—what can it Have all been about? I know 'twas the happiest, quaintest Combination of pathos and fun: But I've got no idea—the faintest— Of what was the actual pun. I think it was somehow connected With something I'd recently read— Or heard—or perhaps recollected On going to bed. What had I been reading? The Standard: “Double Bigamy;” “Speech of the Mayor.” And later—eh? yes! I meandered Through some chapters of Vanity Fair. How it fuses the grave with the festive! Yet e'en there, there is nothing so fine— So playfully, subtly suggestive— As that joke of mine. Did it hinge upon “parting asunder?” No, I don't part my hair with my brush. Was the point of it “hair”? Now I wonder! Stop a bit—I shall think of it—hush! There's hare, a wild animal—Stuff! It was something a deal more recondite: Of that I am certain enough; And of nothing beyond it. Hair—locks! There are probably many Good things to be said about those. Give me time—that's the best guess of any— “Lock” has several meanings, one knows. Iron locks—iron-gray locks—a “deadlock”— That would set up an everyday wit: Then of course there's the obvious “wedlock;” But that wasn't it. No! mine was a joke for the ages; Full of intricate meaning and pith; A feast for your scholars and sages— How it would have rejoiced Sidney Smith! 'Tis such thoughts that ennoble a mortal And, singling him out from the herd, Fling wide immortality's portal— But what was the word? Ah me! 'tis a bootless endeavour. As the flight of a bird of the air Is the flight of a joke—you will never See the same one again, you may swear. 'Twas my firstborn, and O how I prized it! My darling, my treasure, my own! This brain and none other devised it— And now it has flown. ON THE BEACH LINES BY A PRIVATE TUTOR When the young Augustus Edward Has reluctantly gone bedward (He's the urchin I am privileged to teach), From my left-hand waistcoat pocket I extract a batter'd locket And I commune with it, walking on the beach. I had often yearn'd for something That would love me, e'en a dumb thing; But such happiness seem'd always out of reach: Little boys are off like arrows With their little spades and barrows, When they see me bearing down upon the beach; And although I'm rather handsome, Tiny babes, when I would dance 'em On my arm, set up so horrible a screech That I pitch them to their nurses With (I fear me) mutter'd curses, And resume my lucubrations on the beach. And the rabbits won't come nigh me, And the gulls observe and fly me, And I doubt, upon my honour, if a leech Would stick on me as on others, And I know if I had brothers They would cut me when we met upon the beach. So at last I bought this trinket; For (although I love to think it) 'Twasn't given me, with a pretty little speech: No! I bought it of a pedlar, Brown and wizen'd as a medlar, Who was hawking odds and ends about the beach. But I've managed, very nearly, To believe that I was dearly Loved by Somebody, who (blushing like a peach) Flung it o'er me saying, “Wear it For my sake”—and I declare, it Seldom strikes me that I bought it on the beach. I can see myself revealing Unsuspected depths of feeling, As, in tones that half upbraid and half beseech, I aver with what delight I Would give anything—my right eye— For a souvenir of our stroll upon the beach. O! that eye that never glisten'd And that voice to which I've listen'd But in fancy, how I dote upon them each! How regardless what o'clock it Is, I pore upon that locket Which does not contain her portrait, on the beach! As if something were inside it I laboriously hide it, And a rather pretty sermon you might preach Upon Fantasy, selecting For your “instance” the affecting Tale of me and my proceedings on the beach. I depict her, ah, how charming! I portray myself alarming Her by swearing I would “mount the deadly breach,” Or engage in any scrimmage For a glimpse of her sweet image, Or her shadow, or her footprint on the beach. And I'm ever ever seeing My imaginary Being, And I'd rather that my marrowbones should bleach In the winds, than that a cruel Fate should snatch from me the jewel Which I bought for one and sixpence on the beach. LOVERS, AND A REFLECTION In moss-prankt dells which the sunbeams flatter (And heaven it knoweth what that may mean; Meaning, however, is no great matter) Where woods are a-tremble, with rifts atween; Thro' God's own heather we wonn'd together, I and my Willie (O love my love): I need hardly remark it was glorious weather, And flitterbats waver'd alow, above: Boats were curtseying, rising, bowing, (Boats in that climate are so polite), And sands were a ribbon of green endowing, And O the sundazzle on bark and bight! Thro' the rare red heather we danced together, (O love my Willie!) and smelt for flowers: I must mention again it was gorgeous weather, Rhymes are so scarce in this world of ours:— By rises that flush'd with their purple favours, Thro' becks that brattled o'er grasses sheen, We walked and waded, we two young shavers, Thanking our stars we were both so green. We journeyed in parallels, I and Willie, In fortunate parallels! Butterflies, Hid in weltering shadows of daffodilly Or marjoram, kept making peacock eyes: Songbirds darted about, some inky As coal, some snowy (I ween) as curds; Or rosy as pinks, or as roses pinky— They reck of no eerie To-come, those birds! But they skim over bents which the millstream washes, Or hang in the lift 'neath a white cloud's hem; They need no parasols, no goloshes; And good Mrs. Trimmer she feedeth them. Then we thrid God's cowslips (as erst His heather) That endowed the wan grass with their golden blooms; And snapt—(it was perfectly charming weather)— Our fingers at Fate and her goddess-glooms: And Willie 'gan sing (O, his notes were fluty; Wafts fluttered them out to the white-wing'd sea)— Something made up of rhymes that have done much duty, Rhymes (better to put it) of “ancientry:” Bowers of flowers encounter'd showers In William's carol—(O love my Willie!) Then he bade sorrow borrow from blithe to-morrow I quite forget what—say a daffodily: A nest in a hollow, “with buds to follow,” I think occurred next in his nimble strain; And clay that was “kneaden” of course in Eden— A rhyme most novel, I do maintain: Mists, bones, the singer himself, love-stories, And all least furlable things got “furled;” Not with any design to conceal their “glories,” But simply and solely to rhyme with “world.” O if billows and pillows and hours and flowers, And all the brave rhymes of an elder day, Could be furled together, this genial weather, And carted, or carried on “wafts” away, Nor ever again trotted out—ah me! How much fewer volumes of verse there'd be! THE COCK AND THE BULL You see this pebble-stone? It's a thing I bought Of a bit of a chit of a boy i' the mid o' the day— I like to dock the smaller parts-o'-speech, As we curtail the already cur-tail'd cur (You catch the paronomasia, play 'po' words?) Did, rather, i' the pre-Landseerian days. Well, to my muttons. I purchased the concern, And clapt it i' my poke, having given for same By way o' chop, swop, barter or exchange— “Chop” was my snickering dandiprat's own term— One shilling and fourpence, current coin o' the realm. O-n-e one and f-o-u-r four Pence, one and fourpence—you are with me, sir?— What hour it skills not: ten or eleven o' the clock, One day (and what a roaring day it was Go shop or sight-see—bar a spit o' rain!) In February, eighteen sixty nine, Alexandrina Victoria, Fidei Hm—hm—how runs the jargon? being on throne. Such, sir, are all the facts, succinctly put, The basis or substratum—what you will— Of the impending eighty thousand lines. “Not much in 'em either,” quoth perhaps simple Hodge. But there's a superstructure. Wait a bit. Mark first the rationale of the thing: Hear logic rivel and levigate the deed. That shilling—and for matter o' that, the pence— I had o' course upo' me—wi' me say— (Mecum's the Latin, make a note o' that) When I popp'd pen i' stand, scratch'd ear, wiped snout, (Let everybody wipe his own himself) Sniff'd—tch!—at snuffbox; tumbled up, he-heed, Haw-haw'd (not hee-haw'd, that's another guess thing:) Then fumbled at, and stumbled out of, door, I shoved the timber ope wi' my omoplat; And in vestibulo, i' the lobby to-wit, (Iacobi Facciolati's rendering, sir,) Donn'd galligaskins, antigropeloes, And so forth; and, complete with hat and gloves, One on and one a-dangle i' my hand, And ombrifuge (Lord love you!), case o' rain, I flopp'd forth, 'sbuddikins! on my own ten toes, (I do assure you there be ten of them), And went clump-clumping up hill and down dale To find myself o' the sudden i' front o' the boy. Put case I hadn't 'em on me, could I ha' bought This sort-o'-kind-o'-what-you-might-call toy, This pebble-thing, o' the boy-thing? Q. E. D. That's proven without aid from mumping Pope, Sleek porporate or bloated Cardinal. (Isn't it, old Fatchaps? You're in Euclid now.) So, having the shilling—having i' fact a lot— And pence and halfpence, ever so many o' them, I purchased, as I think I said before, The pebble (lapis, lapidis, -di, -dem, -de— What nouns 'crease short i' the genitive, Fatchaps, eh?) O' the boy, a bare-legg'd beggarly son of a gun, For one-and-fourpence. Here we are again. Now Law steps in, bigwigg'd, voluminous-jaw'd; Investigates and re-investigates. Was the transaction illegal? Law shakes head Perpend, sir, all the bearings of the case. At first the coin was mine, the chattel his. But now (by virtue of the said exchange And barter) vice versa all the coin, Per juris operationem, vests I' the boy and his assigns till ding o' doom; (In sæcula sæculo-o-o-orum; I think I hear the Abate mouth out that.) To have and hold the same to him and them. . . Confer some idiot on Conveyancing. Whereas the pebble and every part thereof, And all that appertaineth thereunto, Quodcunque pertinet ad eam rem, (I fancy, sir, my Latin's rather pat) Or shall, will, may, might, can, could, would or should, (Subaudi cætera—clap we to the close— For what's the good of law in a case o' the kind) Is mine to all intents and purposes. This settled, I resume the thread o' the tale. Now for a touch o' the vendor's quality. He says a gen'lman bought a pebble of him, (This pebble i' sooth, sir, which I hold i' my hand)— And paid for't, like a gen'lman, on the nail. “Did I o'ercharge him a ha'penny? Devil a bit. Fiddlepin's end! Get out, you blazing ass! Gabble o' the goose. Don't bugaboo-baby me! Go double or quits? Yah! tittup! what's the odds?” —There's the transaction view'd i' the vendor's light. Next ask that dumpled hag, stood snuffling by, With her three frowsy blowsy brats o' babes, The scum o' the kennel, cream o' the filth-heap—Faugh! Aie, aie, aie, aie!????????????, ('Stead which we blurt out Hoighty toighty now)— And the baker and candlestickmaker, and Jack and Gill, Blear'd Goody this and queasy Gaffer that. Ask the schoolmaster. Take schoolmaster first. He saw a gentleman purchase of a lad A stone, and pay for it rite, on the square, And carry it off per saltum, jauntily, Propria quæ maribus, gentleman's property now (Agreeably to the law explain'd above), In proprium usum, for his private ends. The boy he chuck'd a brown i' the air, and bit I' the face the shilling: heaved a thumping stone At a lean hen that ran cluck clucking by, (And hit her, dead as nail i' post o' door,) Then abiit—what's the Ciceronian phrase?— Excessit, evasit, erupit—off slogs boy; Off like bird, avi similis—(you observed The dative? Pretty i' the Mantuan!)—Anglice Off in three flea skips. Hactenus, so far, So good, tam bene. Bene, satis, male—, Where was I with my trope 'bout one in a quag? I did once hitch the syntax into verse: Verbum personale, a verb personal, Concordat—ay, “agrees,” old Fatchaps—cum Nominativo, with its nominative, Genere, i' point o' gender, numero, O' number, et persona, and person. Ut, Instance: Sol ruit, down flops sun, et and, Montes umbrantur, out flounce mountains. Pah! Excuse me, sir, I think I'm going mad. You see the trick on't though, and can yourself Continue the discourse ad libitum. It takes up about eighty thousand lines, A thing imagination boggles at: And might, odds-bobs, sir! in judicious hands, Extend from here to Mesopotamy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS SONNET When o'er the world night spreads her mantle dun, In dreams, my love, I see those stars thine eyes Lighting the dark; but when the royal sun Looks o'er the pines and fires the orient skies, I bask no longer in thy beauty's ray, And lo! my world is bankrupt of delight: Murk night seemed lately fair-complexioned day: Hope-bringing day seems now most doleful night. End, weary day, that art no day to me! Return, fair night, to me the best of days! But oh, my rose, whom in my dreams I see, Enkindle with like bliss my waking gaze! Replete with thee, e'en hideous night grows fair, Then what would sweet morn be, if thou wert there! THE BOTTLING OF THE WASP The wasps were one morning obtrusively gay: Said my true love, “I know what'll speed them away: From a nail, or a chairback, a bottle hang down, And they're ‘tree'd’—the brave varmints that buzz round your crown!” He hath found an old bottle, I cannot say where; He hath bound it with skill to the back of a chair; Full of mild ale so yellow and sugar so brown; And he “tree'd” them by dozens, I bet you a crown. They may talk of their hares, of their rabbits, and all, Such round-headed rascals, in Westminster Hall. But tell legislators, the things to put down Are those queer little imps that encircle one's crown. So here's to their health, when they next travel here: The sugar's unrivalled, resistless the beer: And in peace may they leave us, themselves while they drown In the healthy malt liquor that's sold at the “Crown.” A LIFE IN THE COUNTRY (Stanzas for Music) “Oh! a life in the country how joyous, How ineffably charming it is; With no ill-mannered crowds to annoy us, Nor odious neighbours to quiz!” So murmured the beautiful Harriet To the fondly affectionate Brown, As they rolled in the flame-coloured chariot From the nasty detestable town; Singing, “Oh, a life in the country how joyous, How ineffably charming it is!” “I shall take a portfolio quite full Of the sweetest conceivable glees; And at times manufacture delightful Little odes to the doves in the trees. There'll be dear little stockingless wretches In those hats that are so picturesque, Who will make the deliciousest sketches, Which I'll place in my Theodore's desk; And Oh, &amp;c. “Then how pleasant to study the habits Of the creatures we meet as we roam: And perhaps keep a couple of rabbits, Or some fish and a bullfinch at home! The larks, when the summer has brought 'em, Will sing overtures quite like Mozart's, And the blackberries, dear, in the autumn Will make the most exquisite tarts! And Oh, &amp;c. “The bells of the sheep will be ringing All day amid sweet-scented flowers, As we sit by some rivulet singing About May and her beautiful bowers. We'll take intellectual rambles In those balm-laden evenings of June, And say it reminds one of Campbell's (Or somebody's) lines to the moon; And Oh, &amp;c.—it is.” But these charms began shortly to pall on The taste of the gay Mrs. Brown: She hadn't a body to call on, Nor a soul that could make up a gown. She was yearning to see her relations; And besides had a troublesome cough; And in fact she was losing all patience, And exclaimed, “We must really be off, Though a life in the country so joyous, So ineffably charming it is.” “But this morning I noticed a beetle Crawl along on the dining-room floor If we stay till the summer, the heat 'll Infallibly bring out some more. Now, few have a greater objection To beetles than Harriet Brown: And, my dear, I think, on reflection— I should like to go back to the town. Though, &amp;c.” APRIL OR, THE NEW HAT [In deference to a prevalent taste this Poem is also a Double Acrostic] Prologue My Boots had been wash'd—well wash'd—in a show'r; But little I griev'd about that: What I felt was the havock a single half-hour Had made with my costly new Hat. For the Boot, tho' its lustre be dimm'd, shall assume Fresh sprightliness after a while: But what art may restore its original bloom, When once it hath flown, to the Tile? I clomb to my perch, and the Horses (a bay And a brown) trotted off with a clatter: The Driver look'd round in his affable way And said huskily “Who is your hatter?” I was pleas'd that he'd notic'd its shape and its shine, And as soon as we reached the Old Druid I begg'd that he'd drink to my new Four-and-nine In a glass of his favourite Fluid. A gratified smile sat, I own, on my lips When the Landlady called to the Master (He was standing hard by with his hands on his hips) To “look at the gentleman's Castor!” I laugh'd, as an Organ-man paus'd in mid-air ('Twas an air that I happen'd to know By a great foreign Maestro) expressly to stare At ze gent wiz ze joli chapeau. Yet how swift is the transit from laughter to tears! Our glories, how fleeting are they! That Hat might (with care) have adorned me for years; But 'twas ruin'd, alack, in a Day! How I lov'd thee, my Bright One! I wrench in Remorse My hands from my Coat-tail and wring 'em: “Why did not I, why, as a matter of course, When I purchas'd thee, purchase a Gingham!” THE CUCKOO Forth I wandered, years ago, When the summer sun was low, And the forest all aglow With his light: 'Twas a day of cloudless skies; When the trout neglects to rise, And in vain the angler sighs For a bite. And the cuckoo piped away— How I love his simple lay, O'er the cowslip fields of May As it floats! May was over, and of course He was just a little hoarse, And appeared to me to force Certain notes. Since Mid-April, men averred, People's pulses, inly stirred By the music of the bird, Had upleapt: It was now the end of June; I reflected that he'd soon Sing entirely out of tune, And I wept. Looking up, I marked a maid Float balloon-like o'er the glade, Casting evermore a staid Glance around: And I thrilled with sweet surprise When she dropt, all virgin-wise, First a courtesy, then her eyes, To the ground. Other eyes have p'raps to you Seemed ethereally blue, But you see you never knew Kate Adair. What a mien she had! Her hat With what dignity it sat On the mystery, or mat, Of her hair! We were neighbours. I had doff d Cap and hat to her so oft That they both of them were soft In the brim: I had gone out of my way To bid e'en her sire good-day, Though I wasn't, I may say, Fond of him:— We had met, in streets and shops; But by rill or mazy copse, Where your speech abruptly stops And you get Dithyrambic ere you know it— Where, though nothing of a poet, You intuitively go it— Never yet. So my love had ne'er been told! Till the day when out I strolled And the jolly cuckoo trolled Forth his song, Naught had passed between us two Save a bashful ‘How d'ye do’ And a blushing ‘How do you Get along?’ But that eve (how swift it passed!) Words of fire flew from me fast For the first time and the last In my life: Low and lower drooped her chin, As I murmured how I'd skin Or behead myself to win Such a wife. There we stood. The squirrel leaped Overhead: the throstle peeped Through the leaves, all sunlight-steeped, Of the lime: There we stood alone:—a third Would have made the thing absurd:— And she scarcely spoke a word All the time. Katie junior (such a dear!) Has attained her thirteenth year, And declares she feels a queer Sort of shock— Not unpleasant though at all— When she hears a cuckoo call: So I've purchased her a small Cuckoo-clock. THE POET AND THE FLY Part I Round the Poet, ere he slumbered, Sang the Fly thro' hours unnumbered; Sauntered, if he seemed to doze, O'er the arch that was his nose, Darting thence to re-appear In his subtly-chambered ear: When at last he slept right soundly, It transfixed him so profoundly, Caused him agony so horrid, That he woke and smote his forehead (It's the course that poets take When they're trifled with) and spake:— “Fly! Thy brisk unmeaning buzz Would have roused the man of Uz; And, besides thy buzzing, I Fancy thou'rt a stinging fly. Fly—who'rt peering, I am certain, At me now from yonder curtain: Busy, curious, thirsty fly (As thou'rt clept, I well know why)— Cease, if only for a single Hour, to make my being tingle! Flee to some loved haunt of thine; To the valleys where the kine, Udder-deep in grasses cool, Or the rushy-margined pool, Strive to lash thy murmurous kin (Vainly) from their dappled skin! Round the steed's broad nostrils flit, Till he foams and champs the bit, And, reluctant to be bled, Tosses high his lordly head. I have seen a thing no larger Than thyself assail a charger; He—who unconcerned would stand All the braying of the band, Who disdained trombone and drum— Quailed before that little hum. I have seen one flaunt his feelers 'Fore the steadiest of wheelers, And at once the beast would bound, Kangaroo-like, off the ground. Lithe o'er moor and marish hie, Like thy king, the Dragon-fly; With the burnished bee skim over Sunlit uplands white with clover; Or, low-brooding on the lea, Warn the swain of storms to be! —Need I tell thee how to act? Do just anything in fact. Haunt my cream ('twill make thee plump), Filch my sugar, every lump; Round my matin-coat keep dodging, In my necktie find a lodging (Only, now that I reflect, I Rather seldom wear a necktie); Perforate my Sunday hat; (It's a new one—what of that?) Honeycomb my cheese, my favourite, Thy researches will but flavour it; Spoil my dinner-beer, and sneak up Basely to my evening tea-cup; Palter with my final toddy; But respect my face and body! Hadst thou been a painted hornet, Or a wasp, I might have borne it; But a common fly or gnat! Come, my friend, get out of that.” Dancing down, the insect here Stung him smartly on the ear; For a while—like some cheap earring— Clung there, then retreated jeering. (As men jeer, in prose or rhyme, So may flies, in pantomime; We discern not in their buzz Language, but the poet does.) Long he deemed him at Death's door; Then sprang featly to the floor, Seized his water-jug and drank its Whole contents; hung several blankets Round his lair and pinned them fast: “I shall rest,” he moaned, “at last.” But anon a ghastlier groan To the shuddering night made known That with blanket and with pin He had shut the creature IN. Part II While unto dawn succeeded day, Unresting still the Victim lay; The many-limbed one had its way. He heard the stair-clock's tranquil ticks; When it exultingly struck six, He gave a score or so of kicks. “Before to-morrow's sun up-climbs,” He feebly said, “yon leafy limes, I'll write a letter to the ‘Times.’” Haggard and wan, when noon was nigh, He rose and flung his window high; He heard, beneath, an old man's cry. He strove—but idly strove—to eat; Till now, to see the potted meat Vanish before him was a treat. He strove to write, but strove in vain; Dark thoughts 'gan shape them in his brain; He listened to that old man's strain. It rang out, maddeningly distinct; As he gave ear to it he winked; He dropped the pen that he had inked. (Song of Old Man below.) “Catch-'em-alive! Gentlemen, I've Here such a dose as no fly can survive. House-fly, blue-bottle, Garden-fly—what'll Save him when once he's got this in his throttle? Let e'en a wasp dip his nose in the mixture, Spread on a plate, and that wasp is a fixture. Buy, buy; give it a try; Don't be put down by a poor little fly. Who'll purchase any? Only a penny Kills you them all, if it's ever so many.” He bought, he placed some on a plate; I wis, he had not long to wait; They ate it at a frightful rate. But on his friend of yesternight (He knew the animal by sight) His baffled gaze could ne'er alight. At last he noticed the unfeeling Brute in a casual manner wheeling Round an excrescence in the ceiling. Self-poised, it eyed the heaps of slain; But, that it did not entertain A thought of joining them, was plain. It winged that upper-air till ten, The bard's retiring-hour; and then Descending, tackled him again. Next morn the young man made his will; And either shot himself at drill Or sucked slow poison through a quill. The Thing accurst—the Vaticide— All wiles for snaring him defied; And at a good old age he died. This tale (I guarantee it true), Reader, I dedicate to you. If you can find its moral, do.</field>
