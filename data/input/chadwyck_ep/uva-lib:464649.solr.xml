      <field name="fulltext">THE Office For Sunday. MATINS. Hymn. I. [Behold we come, dear Lord, to Thee] Behold we come, dear Lord, to Thee; And bow before thy Throne: We come to offer, on our knee, Our vows to Thee alone. What e're we have, what e're we are, Thy bounty freely gave: Thou dost us here in mercy spare; And wilt hereafter save. But O, can all our store afford No better gifts for Thee? Thus we confess thy riches, Lord; And thus our poverty. 'Tis not our tongue or knee can pay The mighty debt we ow: Far more we should, than we can say, Far lower than we bow. Come then, my soul, bring all thy pow'rs, And grieve thou hast no more: Bring ev'ry day thy choycest hours, And thy great God adore. But above all, prepare thy hart, On this his own blest Day: In its sweet task to bear thy part, And sing, and love, and pray. Glory to Thee, Eternal Lord! Thrice blessed Three in One: Thy Name at all times be ador'd; Till time it self be done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday Lauds. Hymn. II. [VVake my Soul, rise from this Bed] VVake my Soul, rise from this Bed Of dull and slugish earth: Quickly rise, lift up thy head, And see thy Lords new birth. Once He cam, O blessed He! Born of a Virgin-Womb. Now He comes (both times for thee) Sprung from a Virgin tomb. Lo he rises fresh and bright, Incircled round with Stars; Which from Him take all their light, And from his glorious Scars. Stil as He his progress makes Up to his heav'n again, Each blest Saint his musick takes, And follows in his train. Thus together They ascend, Til at heav'n gates they come; Where the Angels all attend, To bid them welcom home. Soon they know again their King, Soon they his Call obey: All the Quires come forth to sing, And crown with mirth the Day. Come, my soul, let us rejoyce, Let us our Concert bring: Up to heav'n lets lift our voice, And with the Angels sing, Glory, honor, pow'r and praise To the mysterious Three; As at first begining was, May now, and ever be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday Vespers. Hymn III. [Why do we seek felicity] Why do we seek felicity, Where 'tis not to be found; And not, dear Lord, look up to Thee, Where all delights abound? Why do we seek for treasure here, On this false barren sand: Where nought but empty shels appear, And marks of Shipwrack stand? O world, how litle do thy joys Concern a soul that knows It self not made for such low toys, As thy poor hand bestows! How cross art thou to that design For which we had our birth! Us, who were made in heav'n to shine, Thou bow'st down to thy earth. Nay, to thy hell; for thither sink All that to thee submit: Thou strew'st some flowers on the brink, To drown us in the pit. World, take away thy tinsel wares, That dazle here our eys: Let us go up above the Stars, Where all our treasure lys. The way we know; our dearest Lord Himself is gone before: And has ingag'd his faithful word To open us the door. But, O my God! reach down thy hand, And take us up to Thee: That we about thy Throne may stand; And all thy glories see. All glory to the sacred Three, One everliving Lord: As at the first, still may He be Belov'd, obey'd, ador'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday Complin. Hymn IV. [Dear Jesu, when, when will it be] Dear Jesu, when, when will it be, That I no more shall break with Thee! When will this war of passions cease; And let my soul injoy thy peace! Here I repent, and sin again; Now I revive, and now am slain: Slain with the same unhappy dart; Which, O, too often wounds my hart. When, dearest Lord, when shall I be A garden seal'd to all but Thee! No more expos'd, no more undone; But live and grow to Thee alone. 'Tis not alas, on this low earth That such pure flow'rs can find a birth: Only they spring above the skys; Where none can live, till here he dys. Then let me dy, that I may go And dwell where those bright lillys grow: Where those blest plants of glory rise; And make a safer Paradise. No dangerous fruit, no tempting Eve, No crafty Serpent, to deceive: But we like Gods indeed shall be; O let me dy, that life to see. Thus says my song; but does my hart Joyn with the words, and sing its part? Am I so thorow-wise to chuse The Other world, and this refuse? Why should I not? what do I find That fully here contents my mind? What is this meat, and drink, and sleep, That such poor things from heav'n should keep? What is this honour, or great place Or bag of mony, or fair face? What's all the world that thus we shou'd Still long to dwell with flesh and blood? Fear not my soul, stand to the word, Which thou hast sung to thy dear Lord: Let but thy love be firm and true; And with more heat thy wish renew. O may this dying life make hast, To dy into true life at last: No hope have I to live before; But then to live, and dy no more. Great Everliving God! to Thee, In Essence One, in Persons Three; May all thy works their tribute bring, And every age thy glory sing. [Blest Mother of our Lord! whose pray'rs display] Blest Mother of our Lord! whose pray'rs display The gates of heav'n, whose light directs our way Here in these dangerous Seas; obtain supplies For those who often fall, yet strive to rise: Thou, at whom Nature stood amaz'd to see The world's Creator humbly born of Thee: Thou, whom the Angel did that homage pay, All-spotless Virgin, for us sinners pray. [Hail Queen of Angels holy Quires] Hail Queen of Angels holy Quires; Hail whom the Court of heav'n admires; Thou art the Root whence our joys spring; The Gate that light to us didst bring; Heav'ns brightest Saints thy grace outshines; Thy Glory, all the Seraphins: Live, happy Favorite of Thy Son, And plead our cause at his dread Throne. [Rejoyce chast Queen of Angels, and apply] Rejoyce chast Queen of Angels, and apply All those blest Quires to sing this Victory: He that was born of Thee, and dy'd for us, Has conquer'd death; is risen glorious: Sing then, and in thy hymns this mercy crave, That thy great Son our souls in Judgment save. [Hail Queen of Saints; Hail mercies Mother] Hail Queen of Saints; Hail mercies Mother Our life, our hope, our comfort, Hail: To thee, deploring one another, We poor Eves banish't off-spring wail. To thee we cry; and our sad moans Sigh out into thy tender ears: To thee our harts weep bitter groans In this doleful vale of tears. Hear, glorious Advocate, O hear, And towards wretched us incline The gracious aspect of those dear Compassionating eys of thine. Soft source of pity, mil'd, and sweet, O Mary, ever Virgin-pure; Behold us prostrate at thy feet And by thy pow'rful pray'rs procure, That an unweary'd close persuit, Of life, may bring us so to dy, We may on JESUS, thy blest Fruit, Feast our glad eys eternally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday Matins. Hymn V. [Wake now, my Soul, and humbly hear] Wake now, my Soul, and humbly hear What thy mild Lord commands: Each word of his wil charm thine ear, Each word wil guide thy hands. Hark how his sweet and tender care Complys with our weak minds: What e're our state and temper are, Stil some fit work he finds. They that are merry let them sing, And let the sad harts pray: Let those stil ply their cheerful wing; And these their sober way. So mounts the early chirping Lark Stil upward to the Skys So sits the Turtle in the dark, Among her groans and crys. And yet the Lark, and yet the Dove, Both sing, though several parts: And so should we, how e're we move With light or heavy harts. Or rather Both should both assay; And their cross-notes unite: Both grief and joy should sing and pray; Since both such hopes invite. Hopes that all present sorrow heal; All present joy transcend; Hopes to possess, and tast, and feel Delights that never end. All glory to the sacred Three, All honor, power and praise: As at the first, may ever be Beyond the end of days. Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday Lauds. Hymn VI. [Hark, my soul, how every thing] Hark, my soul, how every thing Strives to serve our bounteous King: Each a double tribute pays; Sings it part, and then obeys. Nature's chief and sweetest Quire Him with cheerful notes admire: Chanting every day their Lauds; While the grove their song applauds. Though their voices lower be, Streams have too their melody: Night and day they warbling run; Never pause, but stil sing on. All the flow'rs that guild the spring, Hither their still-musick bring: If Heav'n bless them, thankful they Smell more sweet, and look more gay. Only we can scarce afford This short Office to our Lord: We, on whom his bounty flows; All things gives, and nothing ows. Wake for shame my sluggish hart; Wake, and gladly sing thy part: Learn of birds, and springs, and flow'rs, How to use thy nobler pow'rs. Call whole nature to thy aid; Since 'twas He whole nature made: Join in one eternal song, Who to one God all belong. Live for ever, glorious Lord! Live by all thy works ador'd: One in Three, and Three in One, Thrice we bow to Thee alone. Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday Vespers. Hymn VII. [Lord, who shal dwel above with Thee] Lord, who shal dwel above with Thee, There on thy holy Hill? Who shal those glorious Prospects see That heav'n with gladnes fill? Those happy souls who prize that life Above the bravest here: Whose greatest hope, whose eagrest strife, Is once to settle there. They use this world, but value That; That they supremely love: They travel through this present state; But place their home above. Lord! who are they that thus chuse Thee, But those Thou first didst chuse? To whom Thou gav'st thy grace most free, Thy grace not to refuse. We of our selvs can nothing do, But all on Thee depend: Thine is the work, and wages too; Thine, both the way and end. O make us stil our work attend, And we'l not doubt our pay: We wil not fear a blessed end, If thou but guide our way. Glory to Thee, O bounteous Lord! Who giv'st to all things breath: Glory to Thee, Eternal Word! Who sav'st us by thy death. Glory, O Blessed Spirit, to Thee Who fill'st our harts with love: Glory to all the Mystick Three, Who reign one God above. Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday Complin. Hymn VIII. [Now, my Soul, the day is gone] Now, my Soul, the day is gone, Which in the morn was thine: Now its glass no more shall run, Its Sun no longer shine. True, alas! the day is gone; O were it only so: Is't not lost as well as done? Cast up thy counts and know. Are we so much nearer heav'n, As to the grave we bow? Has our sorrow made all ev'n, And clear'd the debts we ow? From what vice have we refrain'd, To break the course of sin? What new vertue have we gain'd, To make us rich within? Time is well bestow'd on those Who well their time bestow: Whose main concern still forward goes; Whose hopes still riper grow. Who, when e're the clocks proclaim Another hour is past, Have an art to set their aim And thoughts upon their Last. That their last and happiest hour, Which brings them to their home: Where they sing, and bless the Pow'r That made them thither come. O my God, of life and death The everliving King! Since Thou giv'st to all their breath, May all thy glory sing. Glory, honour, pow'r and praise To the mysterious Three: As at first begining was, May now, and ever be</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday Matins. Hymn IX. [Come let's adore the gracious hand] Come let's adore the gracious hand, That brought us to this light: That gave his Angels strict Command To be our Guard this night. When we laid down our weary head, And sleep seal'd up our ey: They stood and watcht about our bed; To let no harm come nigh. Now we are up, they still go on, And guide us through the day: They never leave their Charge alone; What e're besets our way. And, O my soul, how many snares Ly spred before our feet! In all our joys, in all our cares, Some danger still wee meet. Sometimes the sin does us o'retake, And on our weaknes win: Sometimes our selvs our ruine make; And we o'retake the sin. O save us, Lord, from all those darts, That seek our souls to slay: Save us, from us, and our false harts; Lest we our selvs betray. Save us, O Lord; to Thee we cry, From whom all blessings spring: We on thy grace alone rely; Alone thy glory sing. Glory to Thee, Eternal Lord; Thrice blessed Three in One! Thy name at all times be ador'd; Till time it self be done. Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday Lauds. Hymn X. [Let others take their course] Let others take their course, And sing what Name they please: Let wealth or beauty be their Theme; Such empty sounds as these. For me, I'le ne're admire A lump of burnisht clay: Howe're it shines, it is but dust; And shall to dust decay. Sweet JESUS is the Name My song shall still adore: Sweet JESUS is the charming word, That does my life restore. When I am dead in grief; Or, which is worse, in sin: I call on JESUS, and he hears; And I to live begin. Wherefore to thee bright Name, Behold, thus low I bow; And thus again: yet is all this Far less then what I ow. Down then, down both my knees, Still lower to the ground; While with mine eys and voice lift up, Aloud these lines I sound. Live glorious King of heav'n, By all thy heav'n ador'd: Live gracious Saviour of the world, Our chief, and only Lord. Live, and for ever may Thy throne establisht be: For ever may all harts and tongues Sing hyms of praise to Thee. Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday Vespers. Hymn XI. [Fain would my thoughts fly up to Thee] Fain would my thoughts fly up to Thee, Thy peace sweet Lord to find: But when I offer, still the world Lays clogs upon my mind. Sometimes I climb a litle way, And thence look down below: How nothing, there, do all things seem, That here make such a show! Then round about I turn my eys, To feast my hungry sight: I meet with heav'n in every thing; In every thing delight. I see thy Wisdom ruling all; And it with joy admire: I see my self among such hopes, As set my hart on fire. When I have thus triumph't a while, And think to build my nest: Some cross conceits come fluttering by, And interrupt my rest. Then to the earth again I fall; And from my low dust cry; 'Twas not in my wing, Lord, but thine, That I got up so high. And now, my God, whether I rise, Or still ly down in dust: Both I submit to thy blest will; In both on Thee I trust. Guide thou my way, who art thy self My everlasting End: That every step, or swift, or slow, Still to thy self may tend. To Father, Son and holy Ghost, One Consubstantial Three; All highest praise, all humblest thanks, Now, and for ever be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday Complin. Hymn XII. [Blessed, O Lord, be thy wise grace] Blessed, O Lord, be thy wise grace; That governs all our day: And to the night assigns its place, To rest us in our way. If works the laboring hand impair, Or thoughts the studious mind: Both are consider'd by thy care, Both sit refreshment find. Fit to relieve their present state; Fit to prepare the next: While we are taught to meditate This plain and useful Text. As every Night lays down our head; And morning ope's our eys: So shal the dust be once our bed; And so we hope to rise: To rise, and see that beauteous light Spring from those eys of Thine: Not to be check't by any night; But clear for ever shine. All glory to the sacred Three One everliving Lord: As at the first, still may He be Belov'd, obey'd, ador'd. Amen.</field>

[Open thine eys, my soul, and see] Open thine eys, my soul, and see Once more the light returns to thee: Look round about, and chuse the way Thou mean'st to travel o're to day. Think on the dangers thou mayst meet, And always watch thy sliding feet: Think where thou once hast faln before, And mark the place, and fall no more. Think on the helps thy God bestows; And cast to steer thy life by those: Think on the sweets thy soul did feel, When thou didst well, and do so still. Think on the pains that shall torment Those stubborn sins that ne're repent: Think on the joys which wait above, To crown the head of holy love. Think what at last will be thy part, If thou go'st on where now thou art: See life and death set thee to chuse; One thou must take, and one refuse. O my dear Lord, guide thou my course, And draw me on with thy sweet force: Still make me walk, still make me tend, By Thee my way, to Thee my end. All glory to the sacred Three, One undivided Deity: As it has been in ages gone, May now, and ever, still be done.</field>

Alas, not this alone or That Hast thou bestow'd on me: But all I have, and all I hope, I have, and hope from Thee. And more I have, and more I hope, Then I can speak or think: Thy blessings first refresh, then fill, Then overflow the brink. But though my voice and fancy be Too low to reach thy praise: Yet both shal strain thy glorious Name High as they can to raise.

Be thou alone but with my hart; My God, my only Blyss: I shall not murmur at my part; Nor envy their success. They talk of pleasure, talk of gain; None must their humor cross: But well I know their pleasure's pain; Their greatest profit, loss. Let them talk on; and have not we Our gains, our pleasures too? Pleasures that spring more sweet and free; Gains that more fully flow. Nay, well endur'd, our very pains To us a pleasure are: And all our losses turn to gains; If hopes may have their share. And sure they may; such hopes as chear The heav'n espoused brest: Hopes, that so strangely charm us here, What will they be possest!

Lo here the bread of life, this day's Triumphant Text, provokes thy praise: The living and life-giving Bread, To the great Twelve distributed: When Life Himself at point to dy Of love, was his own Legacy. But, lest That dy too, We are bid, Ever to do what He once did; And by a mindful mystick breath, That we may live, revive his death; With a miraculous Bread and Wine Transum'd, and taught to turn divine. The heav'n-instructed House of Faith Here a mysterious Dictate hath; That they but lend their form and face, Themselvs with reverence leave their place, Nature, and Name, to be made good By a nobler Bread, more needful Blood. Where nature's law no leave will give; Bold Faith takes hart, and dares believe: In different species, Names not Things, Himself to me my Saviour brings: As meat in That, as drink in this; But still in Both, one Christ he is. Yet the receiving mouth here makes Nor wound nor breach in what he takes: Let one alone, or thousands be Here the Dividers; single he Bears home no less, All they no more; Nor leave they Both less then before. Lo the life-food of Angels, then, Bow'd to the lowly mouths of men. Lo the full final Sacrifice; On which all Figures fixt their eys; The ransom'd Isaac, and his Ram, The Manna, and the Paschal Lamb. Jesu, to Thee we sinners sue; O Thou our Food, and Shepherd too! Still by Thy self vouchsafe to keep, As with thy self thou feed'st thy Sheep. Blest be that Love which thus makes Thee Mix with our low mortality. O may It raise and set us up Convicters of thine own full Cup; Coheirs of Saints: that so all may Drink the same wine, and the same way: Nor change the pasture, but the place; To feed on Thee, in thine own Face.

Down busy sense, Discourses dy; And all adore Faith's Mystery: Faith is my skill, Faith can believe As fast as Love new laws can give. Faith is my ey, Faith strength affords, To keep pace with those pow'rful words: And words more sure, more sweet then they, Love could not think, Truth could not say. O dear Memorial of that death, VVhich still survives and gives us breath! Live ever bread of Life, and be My food, my joy, my all to me. Come glorious Lord, my hopes encrease; And fill my portion in thy peace: Come hidden life, and that long day For which I languish, come away.

Keep stil lively in my mind; How I ought to be resign'd: How this Pattern ought destroy All my sensual greif or joy.

Seek no more abroad thy rest; But seek at home, in thine own brest: Let thy mind from guilt be clear; Then look for all thy comfort there.

Should death's self thy walls assail, Still thou art safe and canst not fail: Still thy soul's thine own, and she To a new house remov'd shall be. New and lasting there above, All built and furnish't with pure love: There shall this mud wall of thine, Repair'd, the brightest stars outshine.

Here for a time this heav'nly Plant Fairly grew up and thriv'd: Diffus'd its sweetnes all about, And all in sweetnes liv'd. But envious frosts, and furious storms So long so fiercely chide: This tender Flow'r at last bow'd down Its bruised head, and dy'd. O narrow thoughts, and narrower speech, Here your defects confess: The life of Christ, the death of God, How faintly you express! Help, O thou blessed Virgin-root, Whence this fair Flow'r did spring; Help us to raise both hart and voice, And with more spirit sing: To Father, Son and holy Ghost, One undivided Three, All highest praise, all humblest thanks Now and for ever be.</field>

Long had the World in darknes sate; Til Thou and thy all-glorious light Began to dawn from heav'ns fair gate, And with thy beams dispel their night: We too, alas! stil there had stood, As common slaves in the same shade; But mercy came, and with his blood, Our general ransom freely paid.

No envious thought, no sland'ring tongue Would e're disturb our peace: We should help them, and they help us, And all unkindnes cease. But the All-wise chose other laws, And thought it better so: He made the world, and sure he knows What's best with it to do. 'Tis for our good, that all this ill Is suffer'd here below: Tis to correct those dangerous sweets, That else would poyson grow. So storms are rais'd to clear the ayr.

Hail great Apostles of the Lamb, Who brought that early Ray, Which from our Sun reflected came, And made our first fair day. Hail generous Martyrs, whose strong harts Bravely rejoyc't to prove, How weak, pale death, are all thy darts, Compar'd to those of love. Hail Blessed Confessors, who dy'd A death, too, love did give; While your own flesh You crucify'd, To make your spirit live. Hail beauteous Virgins whose chast vows Renounc't all fond desires; Who wisely chose your Lord for Spouse, And burnt with his pure fires. Hail all you happy Spirits above, Who make that glorious ring About the sparkling Throne of love, And there for ever sing. Hail, and among your Crowns of praise, Present this litle wreath; Which while your lofty Notes you raise, We humbly sing beneath. All glory to the sacred Three, One ever-living Lord: As at the first, stil may he be Belov'd, obey'd, ador'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vespers for Saints. Hymn XXXVIII. [Tell me You bright Stars that shine] Tell me You bright Stars that shine Round about the Lambs high Throne; How, through bodys once like mine, How are you thus glorious grown? Hark with one voice they reply; This was all our happy skil: We on JESUS fixt our ey, And his emi'nent followers stil. As we clearly saw their mind Set and rul'd, we order'd ours: Both This state alone design'd, Up towards this strem'd all our Powers. Taught by Temp'rance we abstain'd From all less for greater Goods: Slighting litle drops, we gain'd Full and sweet and lasting Floods. Arm'd with Fortitude, we bare Lesser Evils, worse to fly: Mortal death we durst outdare, Rather then for ever dy. Iustice we observ'd by giving Every one their utmost due: That in peace, and order living, All might freely Heav'n pursue. Prudence govern'd all the Rest; Prudence made us still apply What was fittest, what was best, To advance great Charity. On those golden wheels of grace, That loves fiery Chariot bear; We ariv'd at this bright place; Follow us and never fear. O sure truth! O ble'st Attesters! O that all the world may prove Of both these such strong digesters, That both these may feed their love. Him who made us all for This; Him who made Himself our way; Him who leads us in't to Blyss; May all praise, and all obey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Complin for Saints. Hymn XXXIX. [Night forbear; alas, our Praise] Night forbear; alas, our Praise, And our young begining hope, Set to grow on these blest days, Faint and dull requires more scope. 'Twill not hear, but sullen flys, Summons all the world to sleep, Bids us close our books and eys, What w'have gain'd content to keep. Blessed Saints! this broken rate Bids our slownes ply its wings: While your quick and active state Always wakes, and always sings. Yet ev'n This your School, too, was; And your now unweary'd Lays, By this change of sing and Pause, Here 'mong us you learnt to raise. Here you, thus, took often breath; Yet have climb'd those hills of light: O may your success bequeath Hope to reach that glorious hight. Though our Notes be short and few, And our Rests too oft and long; If we keep in tune with you, We at last shall sing your song. If our utmost humble powers Here our daily pray'rs attend: These poor Psalms shall there like yours, In a nightless Compline end. Glory Lord to Thee alone, Here below, as there above: May thy joys, Great Three in one, Ever draw and crown our love.</field>
