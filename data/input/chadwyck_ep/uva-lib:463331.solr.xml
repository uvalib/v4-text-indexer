      <field name="fulltext">LOVES OWLE. In dialogue-wise betweene Loue, and an olde man. The old man. Tell me naked wretch of sin, My gates are shut, how cam'st thou in, Thou hast committed Burglarie, To venture all so hardily into my gardin. I thought my age and good aduise, Had rid this garden long ere this Of all thy baggage fooleries, Thy weedes and briery fallaces, and sowre seeds of sin. Goe to (sirrha) get you gone, Let an aged man alone, All retyred as you see To record repentingly his youthes amisses. Neither is this sap-lesse tree, Fit for woonted iollitie: Her fruites and floures are long agoe, Withered in her root below all to anguishes. All her greene, and sweetes are done, Her shadowes dead for want of sonne: All is bryer, and nettle now, That whilom was a gallant bough, and faire flourished. You come not now as earst you did Into a garden beautifid: With beds and Allies, hearbes and floures, Faire Chrystall streames, and banquet-boures, like heauen ouer hed. The Nightingale hath not been heere, Heard to sing this many a yeere; Frost and snow, and winters night, Haue defac'd her beauty quight, and slaine her glory. This house, whose battlements on hie, Whilom faire, brau'd the lofty skie, Towring in pride, and luxurie The top of vaine felicity: such was my folly. See now a cottage it is becoom Of withered sedge, fearne, brake and broome, Ay-me, a rotten reed I am, A cripple, iuyce-lesse aged man, deceast to pleasure. Then get thee gone thou wanton boy, Seeke out some other place of ioy: This garden is a solitude, With ghostly sollaces indu'd; I haue no leasure To entertaine nor thee, nor thine, Fooles and furies of ruine. Oh, how happy are they all That neuer tasted of the gall of thy leud delights. Wretched boy, I tell thee true, Thou art a traitor to thy crue; Protesting gracious complements, Yet ministring but discontents, and all ill dispights. These are thy trim benignities, Incontinent desire of ease, Enuie, disdaine, and ielosie, Doubt, teares, and captiuitie, and all is foolerie. Selfe-loue, vainglorie, passion, Vnrest and desperation, Intemperance, and enmitie, Vaine hope, and melancholy, and impiety; Griefe, brabble, waste and crueltie, Effeminate solemnitie, Treason, distrust, disloyaltie, And after all comes beggerie, and late repentance; These are thy balefull outrages, And benefits of little ease; Ramping rages against reason, Neuer yet out of season among thy Orphans. Loue. These angry tearmes doe represent You neuer skill'd my blandishment; My peace, my sweetes, my lullabies, Wherwith al soules I ciuillize, that bid me welcome. Old. Yes, well I ken thy stonishments, And dangers by experience: This same sin-writhled trunke of mine, Is a fragment of thy ruine, and base martyrdome. This night-shade garden well areeds That all thy solaces are seeds, And weeds of woe:thy sweets but snares T'intangle soules in hell vnwares, ridiculously. A gracious garden once it was, Al ouer-floured with solace Till that thy brutish barbarisme, Through fallacies made entry in, such was my frailty. And now it is, Oh now it is A briery and weedy wildernes: The map of infelicity, A rag of all indignity: a badge of heauy chear. Loue. Good aged Father, for I see Your tearmes are tearmes of iniurie, And flint with flint affoordes but fire, I list not answere you in ire. but will forbeare. And all according to my name, My language shall be free from blame: How euer you in ignorance, And chollericke misgouernance distaine your reuerence. Old. Adulterate synceritie, Thy faire face is fallacie: Thy speech is all hypocrisie, And all thy drist is fellonie, and deadly vengeance. As mildest Oyles are most of force, To penetrate the stubborn'st corse, So happily thou hop'st with sweetes, To draw me downe into the deepes of all thy dangers. Snakes and serpents oft haue I seene, Faire-rowlling on the grassie greene, Their peckles pleasant to the eye, Yet haue they needles inwardly, to sting by-standers. Not that I feare thy poisonous sting, Or any danger thou canst bring: For well I wot these hoary heares, Are Mithredate against the feares of thy infection, Loue. Now that I proffer to replie, Why stop yee your eares so iealously? Old man. The bird that sees &amp; knowes the snare Blame it not, if it beware, of apprehension. Loue. Be not so mis-preiudicate. Old man. Better now then all too late. For though in shew thou seem a friend Yet mischiefe is the latter end of thy dissignment. Loue. Yet heare a while what I wil say Good for euill I will appay: Thy disdaine, and contumelie, I will recompence with glory, and most sweet content. And though that you oppose your will To contradict my kindnesse still; Yet shall my gentle patience Exemplify my good pretence, to make you blessed. Old. Oh what a medly haue we heer? Poison mixt with dainty cheere; Thy words and looks are good inough But care and hell is in the-proofe therof possessed. Then fie vpon thy pipe and thee, I list not heare thy melodie, I am too olde a Marriner, For Syrenes songs to endanger, then prate no more. Loue. These fierce offences specify, Your Natures harsh obliquitie; Wherfore Ile leaue you to the same, And in compassion of your blame, all to deplore. The Judge to doome a wretch to die Answerlesse, is iniurie: Yet you condemne mine innocence, Without admitting my defence, vngentle Father. Old. Nay, say not so, I am content To listen to thy argument, Condition that thou stand aloofe, And interrupt not my disproofe, but heare my answere. For I am willing in this case, To doe thy trumperie due disgrace, As wel by powre of argument, As by the sprite of discontent and just rude-language, Then ware th'infringe not my decree, But prate thy prates aloofe from me, For feare thy filth infect the aire, And so possesse me vnaware with one or other rage. Loue. Alas you much mistake my might, My powre it is no powre of spight, Milde, and merry ciuility, And arme in arme in vnitie is my Philosophy. Which (for I see your good intent Is now dispos'd to argument) I hope so well to iustifie, As you will thinke it honestie, and thanke me highlie. Nor will I challenge for my paines, Anie mercenarie gaines: But onlie as you credite me, So liue you euer merrilie, and I am pleased. Now in the front of your aggriefe, You tearme me a fellon and a theefe: I say, he is no theefe that takes That which another freely forsakes, to be so eased. Besides, to take a thing away, The owner gazing on the praie, Nor contradicting, but agrees, And claps his hands, and glad hee is, what theeuery is this? Then heerin haue you wronged me, To blot me with such infamie. Old. Nay, nay, that tearm is all too true, How er'e I list not prooue it now for verie drowsinesse. I feele a myst com'd ouer mine eies, Fowle befall thy sorceries; But well I wot to be aueng'd, I'le sleepe thy prattle to an end: then prate thy heart out. Loue. I: so my swauetie assignes Rest to rage and angrie mindes: Then sleep your sleep in peace &amp; blesse, I hope you will heare me nearthelesse, I doe not doubt. For why my speeches are a voice Strong in powre, and not in noise, Full possessing the hearers eare, Deafe or dead although he were, so sweet it pierceth. And since you cannot ease your mind, With tearmes ynough of raging kind: In sooth you can not better doe, Then take a nap an houre or two, for rest remildeth. Meane while I'le sing sweet Lullabies, And warlble foorth my swauities, To shew you as by argument, How precious is my blandishment, and merrie bounties. LOVES SONNET. Now that I take my Lute in hand, Rage and rancour I you command, Take your sister Melancholie, And downe to darke hell all hie yee. For heere I meane to make my residence, By vertue of my peacefull influence, And cheere this aged man with louelements for euer. Lullalullabie, &amp;c. Though age be olde and colde, I can Re-young him to a lustie man, And in his iointes infuse a fire, To execute a kinde desire. I can reuegetate his dying yeere, By faire be-priesting him to a bonny-pheere: Or els dispensing him such like good cheere els where. Lullalullaby, &amp;c. As doth the verdant vine amount, Climing vp her counter-mount, Or as the hop or Yuy-vaine Reach the top of their sustaine: So the religious of my vnitie, Enioying one anothers specialtie, Attaine the period of felicitie. and content. Lulla lullabie. Dull melancholy is a rust, Ranckling all good mettles lust, It is a dumpe of dreriments, Fatuity is her whole pretence, But I am an oyle that faire bebrightens all, Of all reioycements I am liberall, And of all wit, I am pedagogicall. and so hent. Lulla lullabie, &amp;c. Nay more: I'le tell you wondrous nues Fyre int'yce I can infuse; I can resuscitate the dead, And giue them lust and liuelihead: The dotard I can make most passing wise, The miser in expence to riotize The coward hardy against his enemies, all for loue. Lulla lullaby, &amp;c. The plough-lob I can ciuillize, The franticke man with grace aguize; Kings and Cesars I subdue, And with my rites their soules in lue. All faire and goodly things I do detect And with my vaile I couer all defect, And all in vnitie I do connect and approoue. Lulla lullabie. Looke vp to heauen, and I am there, I raigne in the celestiall Spheare: The Signes and Planets haue from me Their influence and harmony: Nor heau?, nor earth haue vniformity Nor any faculty her simpathy, Wherby to doe her due actiuity. without me. Lulla lullabie. &amp;c. I doe deuise all gay attyres, Calles, rebatoes, perwigs and wires: Hoop-sleeues, French-bodies, vardingalles, Paintings, perfumes and washing-balles; With twenty thousand such like bonny things, To grace faire Nature, and mis-natures doings, And profite trades by doing my deuisings, workemanly. Lulla lullabie, &amp;c. Feasts and frollickes I doe ordaine, And merrie meetings on the plaine; Reuels, and daunces in a rowe, And morrow-musicke at the window: Tilting, &amp; iusts are my magnificence, The pomp wherof forbeareth no expence, If so my spirit be in the pretence, and grace it. Lulla lullabie, &amp;c. Maskes, and musicke is in the Court, And Maie-pole mirth is country sport, Maie-morning comes but once a yeare, Yet are my doings euery wheare, The court, and country both haue priuities, In which I still maintaine actiuities, By coupling two, and two in sollaces all secret. Lulla lullaby &amp;c. Maides, and widdowes are of my traine, Hard it were they should refraine; The verie Clergie, and their wiues, Loue me as they loue their liues; Men and women all are Salamanders, Glutting my fires euery where in corners, Because they know such fires bode no dangers, nor consume, Lulla lullabie. &amp;c. Wrinckles, and pimples I can cure, And make the stutting tongue demure; The trembling palsey I can staie, And take the misers gowt away: The cripple creature I can make to runne, The blind man with new eyes to see the sunne, And set in other teeth where th'old are done with the rewme. Lulla lullabie. The aged Beldams withered face, I can giue it a glittering grace; Her breath vnsauory to the nose, I can besweeten like the Rose: I can exchange her pale gray haires to golde, Her rewme-cough into musicke manifold, Her bethred bodie all to lust embold, so can I. Lulla lullabie &amp;c. The weakest impotent aliue, My quickening spirit can reuiue, Nor drugs, nor drammes, I minister, Nor pilles, nor powltis, nor plaister, But only a copletiue desire t'inioy The full felicity of a priuy toy, That trulie counter-giues sweet ioy for ioy, al-a-by. Lulla lullabie. &amp;c. Then since I am so physicall, So musicall, so martiall, So Court-accepted, and rurall, And so ioy-mighty ouer all: Be not t'your selfe so preiudiciall, As to refuse my beneficiall Bounties, in ouer-melancholie gall, Lulla lullabie, lulla lullabie. Old. All me no alls, for all is naught, Thy ioyes, and counter-ioyes are fraught With heaps of hels; thy Lullabies Are all accursed miseries, and foule befall men. My eares are much too blame to heare Such foule loue lust-polluted geere; I wisse mine eies were better bent To sleep out all thy babblement and full-a-lying. But as thou dealest in this case, My setled sences to amaze, So all thy bosted benefits Do but bereaue men of their wits, to ensuing yls. Then so an errand theefe thou art, To steale away mens wits by art, Aswell as they are murtherers, That drowne but willing marriners with their musickes wiles. Thou also art a murtherer, In giuing men false wings to houer, About vntrue felicitie, Whereby they fall into the sea of a thousand deathes. Thou art that spirit that S. Powle, Did feele to wrestle with his soule, And pray'd our Lord to set him free From such a peeuish enemie of his wel-wishes. The Poets of Gentilitie, Haue pen'd downe many a historie, How that their gods were turn'd to beastes, In executing thy behestes, and dishonestie. Thou art the excrement of lust, Thy first and last is all vniust, From lust inrag'd to ill asswag'd, So is, so endeth thy disparrage, and ignominie. What louer yet did euer proue, Other complement in loue Then lust? which euery beast can doe, Doing but that, that longs thereto, euen as well as man. So then is it right euident, Thou art but a disparagement, And all thy grace indignity, That so mankind doest beastifie with lustes pollution. Oh what a heauie case is it, Man for lust to loose his wit, And leaue his true Nobility, For brute-beastlie carnalitie, through thy base instinct. King Salomon was passing wise. Till loue and lust did him surprise: And Sampson that most valiant Iue. Was neuer weakened but by you, nor in chaines inlinckt As for thy bosted vnitie, Troy can witnesse that's a lie, Her ten years warres and latter fall Tels, that thou wert cause of all that topsie turuy. What Natures consanguinity, Deere friendship, or affinity, Goodlaw or custome doth vnite, Thou turn'st to discord and despight through thy scurrility. Thou breed'st debate in heretages, Bastardizing families: Thou runst to witches and the deuill, All to compasse thy foule euill, lust and luxurie. Thou vsest poysons for to kill, And to intoxicate the will, Witnesse the Emperour Caligula, So vsed by Cesonia. t'intice his amitie, Rapes and incests are from thee, Thou sparest not Vestality, Nor any place of priuilege, So shamelesse is thy sacrilege, and vile presumption. There is no iust commandement, Nor good obey in Loues intent; For Loue and lust preuaricates Awe, and reason in all estates with leud confusion. And if thou make the miser free, It is to buy more misery; And if thou make the dotard wise, T'is dotage turn'd to Ideotize, as dung to durt. And if thou make the coward stout, It is to compasse filth about, His stoutnes is but shamelesnesse To doe and boast his beastlinesse. a stout peece of worke. If thou remilde the franticke man, Thou mak'st him but a tame foole than, If kings and Cesars thou subdue, What mischiefes doe not then ensue to their common weales? Did not King Rodericke of Spaine Count Iulians bed with lust distaine? From whence ensu'd 800. yeeres Of Spannish warres altogethers, against infidels. King Dauids case is scripturall, What punishments did him befall, And to his people from aboue, For his vnlawfull lustie loue with faire Bersabe, As for thy vaunted Taylery, Thy stillings, and perfumerie, Thy physicke and thy cookerie, All's but abuse of honesty, and traines to foolerie. Vpon a bad foundation, All building's desolation, No glorious guilt or gallant show, Can warrant it from ouerthrow, the ground-work failing. So nor thy brags can better thee, Grounded on Lusts base infamie, The mean-worke being passion, The top a loath'd fruition after once obtayning. Then in like sort is vanitie, Thy Court-ship and thy country glee, But specially thy priuities, And all thy twinfold coplatiues in hugger mugger. And where thou prat'st of miracles, As fire infus'd int' yee-siccles: The dead reuiu'd, the blind to see, And such like cripple trumperie, I tell thee brother. Such vile effectes are monstrous, Not any whit miraculous; For miracles are holy-doomes, And monsters are all but hel-doomes and imperfections. The Deuill I trowe is scandaliz'd, To see a seuent-yeere man surpriz'd With Lusts vndue lubricity, In those yeares of philosophy, and tame fashions. But say that Cesar, and the sage And cripple age sometimes engage It selfe to lust, that argueth Their frailtie, and not thy noblenesse, the fact being foule. Much lesse is heauen beautify'd With any grace from thee deriu'd, It being no fleshly creature, But of a farre better feature, and a better soule. Extreame is thy presumption, To vaunt so high a function, Heauen to be ordered by thee, That art earths onlie infamy, and high dishonour. But as thou art a naked wretch, So is't thy nature to out-stretch Thy limmes to lust, thy lips to lies, Heauen and earth to scandalize, with th'one and th'other. Oh that mankind would but refraine His idle and delicious vaine Of liuing, then were thy puissance Quite quaild, or of pettie nuissance to our mortality. For but in sloth and daintinesse, Raignes thy lustfull wretchednesse; Who-euer liueth otherwise, Doth vanquish thee, and Cæsarize or'e all thy villanie. Long and helthy liueth he, Rich, happy, and merrily, Nor botch, nor poxe, nor lewd vnrest Doth betide his noble brest in paines and temprance. He riots not in gluttony, Nor carroling ebriety; He skils no brabble, nor blasphemes, Nor liues by any vngodly meanes, but with due maintenance. His speech, his gesture, and attire, Represent a stay'd desire; No new-fangle, for me or fashion, Or fantasticall passion taints his discretion. His conuersation is vpright, Shining through all despight: Reason high dominioning All his actions, as a king with reputation. Reason is an Antelope, That lust-full fellowes follow not, With peace and order at her heele, She guides men to the common-weele of glory and fame. She is my lanterne and my light, My Land-lady and my tergat bright, By her I see, to her I fee, By her I am defenc'd from thee, and from all thy shame. She poynts me to a happy Loue Faire and chast in heauen aboue, Whose name is holie Charitie, Grand-mother of all honesty and of all vertue. In which faire loue I see a light Far passing all this worlds delight, T'is vertues retribution When death hath done his function, which none can eschew. Vpon which light and sweet delight Whiles I but newly set my sight, Resoluing to attaine thereto By all the good that I can doe, what wind blew thee hether? To interrupt so deere a thought With thy Loue lust-polluted taulk, As though I were some errand foole Doctrinable in thy Schoole and baudy grammer, Go get thee gone vnhallowed Elfe, And leaue me alone vnto my selfe T'attend my speculation Of th'aforesaid contentation my soule aspires to. Loue. Now haue I heard with patience All your chollericke offence, And sooth to say there is amisse Somewhat in my blessednesse, but I'le shew you how. There is a kind of people, that Being one halfe cold, th'other hot, Know not how to choose the meane, But loue in a vitious extreame, and so dishonour me. Heerhence it is that some men call Me franticke, and fantasticall, Cruell, disloyall, quarrellous, Vnconstant, blind, and impious, such being their frailty. Wil we condemne the parent-bird If that her yoong one vnaffeard Trans-flie her safe prescription, And so fall downe to destruction, skilling no caution? Such is my case; God knowes I meane That no man should loue-misdemeane Himselfe to daunger or reproch; Yet some men doe, and I for such sustaine detraction. Not but that I must confesse, There is a kind of heauinesse In Loues pursuite, but that's to make It (once obtain'd) more delicate to the paines-taker. The more aduenture, the more gaines, No pleasure's sweet without some paines Who neuer wept, laughes sauour-lesse, The fisher-man fisheth boot-lesse that feeles no water. So is it then my propertie To mixe some sowre with swauitie, To make them know that sweete content Is no fondelings base baublement, but of better worth. The appetite that is foregon With ouer-sweet commestion, Tart meates recouer it againe From out that ouer-fed famine with their prickle spurres. And then as doth that appetit Re-sauor euery dainty bit, So all my sowre contraries Are shooing-hornes to swaueties, and refining files. Then maruel not, if now and then You see my sowres among men, The which heerby well may ye know, That still a woman strikes the blow with her wyle-beguiles. The Sunne is not so base a groome, As to be ty'd to euery roome, But heere and there, and as it listes, It flits by selfe-fits and shiftes to shew his freedome. And why not I to shew my state, And make man-kind more kind &amp; grate, Should not likewise sometimes bestow My frets and checkes, and ouerthrow on pleasures kingdome? The fruite of ouer-much fruition, Being of a loath'd condition, I deeme it prudent policie To turne familiaritie sometimes t' enmity. That then as doth the Sunnes retorne Fructifie and faire adorne Each plaine fore-withred with winter, So likewise may my faire re-enter renew all iollity. Then (gentle Eld) admit me now, Comming to re-enter you, And with my sweetest sollaces Ile cheere your ages anguishes, and all to blesse you. I will quite renue your figure, From cripple to youthfull vigure, And on that crased tenement I'le reare a loftie battlement, for all the world to view. Your garden I will faire replant, And set with flowres all aflant, There shall no bryre abide therein, No weed, nor any vnsauorie thing, but I'le plucke it vp. Pleasant streames shall runne along All your plantes and flowres among, All manner sweet-throated birdes Shall sit and sing in the arbors where you dine or sup, Then yeeld your selfe to my awardes, Proffering you so sweete rewardes, Be pleas'd to change your churlish ire To a delicious desire of all sweet sollace. Old. These latter reasons and protests Win me to your sweet behests, For that I note sincerity In this so plaine discouery of your sweet-sowre case. I feele within my conscience Assurance of your innocence, Besides your very nakednesse, That bodes and warranteth no lesse, so shone it shineth, Me thinkes there can no sad mischance Lodge in so faire a countenance, Nor can that tongue auouch vntruth, Being as honey in the mouth, and so sweet sauoreth, But be it true, or be it false, I now recant my denials, And pray you pardon my outrage Imputing it to rude old-age and testie passion. And if that you complie with me In true professed iollitie; Perhaps in time my seruices May honour your benignities, in some good fashion. Loue. So well aduis'd I welcome thee, Euen to my deerest facultie, The which eftsoones thou shalt approue With all the benefits of loue, Loue can affoord thee. And now in honour of accord Vnto this Lute I will record A hymne of ioyfull Iubilie, To rowse vp thy Senechdochie to Loues actiuitie. LOVES SONNET. The day is done, and night inuites Man and woman to deere delightes, The candle's out, and curtaines spred, And he and she are both a bed, All naked is their conuersation, And arme in arme theyr sociation, The rest is void of attestation, as priuily done. Loe there she lies as one content To giue and take all blandishment, Her front is as the yuorie bowle Orient faire, and free from skowle, Her haire is golden grasse vpon a mount, Her eare is musickes happy counter-mount, Her eie a lampe whereby to cast th'account of all benediction. Her cheek's a goodly garden bed, With cherrie-lillie floures or'e-spred, Her nose a pipe of sweete perfumes, There stilles downe no vnsauorie rewmes: Her lips are sweet, like Hyblas hony-comes, Her tongue th'oracle of Loues freedomes, Her teeth the rankes of gallant Mermedones in their brightest hue. Her chinne and necke are seuerallie Snow-white temptations to the eye, Her armes are farmes of sweete abode, Her fingers nets in pleasures floud, Th'Alablaster orbes vpon her breast Are boui'fieu-belloes downe vnto the rest Below, where chiefest pleasure is possest by the bed-fellow. There is no dumpe, nor drerement, Nor galle, nor jawlle in Loues intent, All's naked like to innocence, Boding no offence, nor yet defence. Winter benummes not Louers in a bed, Nor any any Westminstry torments their hed, Nor any death kils their loue-liuelihed, except for ioy they die. Loues Tergate is a smile-faire face, Her bulwarke is another place, With these she war-fareth dull death, And doth preserue mankind on earth, Which els had been long since annihiled, With all other liuing things beside, Had not these implements of loue preuailed man and woman-fully. Loue lusteth after daintie diet, And mirth and musicke must be by it, It heeds no grosse rusticitie, But all that is deere and daintie: Loue is aduenturous for to obtaine, Hauing sweet counteruailes for euery paine, Besides the pleasure of possessed gaine arme in arme at last. Olde age that Loue reuiues to lust, Hath ouer-liued Natures worst: His pleasant play-Feare in a bed Hydra-like renewes his hed, Her fire is that Promotheus did bring From heauen, of force to quicken euery thing, Euen very stones that ner'had any liuing, but say euer waste. See how the musicke-Nightingale, Chauntes day-light on nightes sable vale, Or as the Spring renewes the earth, Vn-wintring it with new-come mirth, So fares old age through loues benignities, So soueraigne are all her actiuities, And Loue with loue so sweet a thing it is, drenching all in ioy. Then old and young be thus aduis'd. Be not with any weale suffis'd, Nor health, nor wealth, nor soueraigntie, Except you loue and loued be: For Loue's a salt that seasoneth all good, Sance Loue all other pleasure is but mud, And loue alonly is lifes liuely-hood, killing all annoy. Old. Oh now embrace we with a kisse And pardon my vnlouingnisse. Loue. I do. Old. Then heerwithall I vow Eternall loyaltie to you, as to my Soueraigne. Loue. Now that we haue embrac'd &amp; kist Tell me how you feele your brist. Old. I feele a rauenous desire Of lust, I feele a flaming fire through'out euery vaine. I feele a fancie full of frets, Rebellion in all my secrets, I feele a fowle exalted yll Quite preuail'd against my will, and against all reason. I feele a wound, yet craue no cure, But rather wish it may endure, I feele it, yet I see it not, So blind I am, or haue forgot my seeing function. Loue. I so: Now will I sit me downe And beard thy gray-beard with a frowne I'le laugh to thinke how all thy fame Of Chastity will turne to shame through base luxurie. Now where is all thy valiancie And bosted prudence against me? Is all thy Stoycal conceipt So soone subuerted by deceipt, and turn'd to foolery? Thou hast my kisse, now haue my curse, Ner' shall thy loue deserue remorse: Still sue and spend, and after all Reape but disdaine and deniall at thy Maistresse hand. And to th'end thou maist approue Thy selfe the verrier foole in loue, Thy Maistresse age must not surpasse Full 15 yeeres by the houre-glasse, so is thy case scann'd. The rest I leaue to her to doe, Flouts, and freaks, and spights ynow, And all the world to wonder at Thee, as an errand Ideot to be so abus'd. Oh what a goodly sight wil't be To see thee in thy foolerie: Cap and curt'sie to the ground, And yet no fauour to be found, but be more misus'd. How like a gallant wilt thou ride With sword and dagger at thy side, Cap and feather on thy crowne With a little Cupid hanging downe thy breast before. And then to heare thy graue requestes Accompaned with deepe protestes And many an anticke countenance To grace each seuerall circumstance, still sighing euermore. Besides thy inward anguishes, Farre worse then all the premises, Vaine hope, and desperation, And doubtfull interpretation of euery occurrent. Presumption and jelousie, Care, passion, and captiuitie, Errour, and indiscretion, Vnrest, and vaine inuention, and thy wealth mispent. These and such like absurdities Shall Owlefie thee'n all mens eies: Who wh? they haue twitted thee to deth Yet shall thy shame suruine vnneth, and thus thy Epitaph. Who er'e thou art that readst this Epitaph aboue, Know that heer vnderneath doth lie the Owle of Loue. Old. Why how now (Loue) is al thy blisse And sweet protests return'd to this? Then I reuoke my fealtie, As vow'd to no such tyrannie and cruell skath. I vow'd my vow to swaueties, And not to infelicities; Nor is it honorablie done To tyrannize submission and poore cripple age Loue. Thy vow was not conditionall To sweetes; but wholly personall To me; in my proprietie To vse thee well or wretchedly in my blesse, or rage. Then art thou sure ynough a slaue To rowe my galley in the waue Of all accurse; thy contradiction Meritting such malediction at my angry hands. So art thou still a Marriner, Nor I the foresaid murtherer, Onlie thy hoary Mithredates Haue prou'd themselues poore pot?ates in their weake withstands. But yet (courage,) I am content To be thus much indifferent, Either that thou take a married wife, And be a Cuckold all thy life, or bide thy present doome. Old. Nor that, nor this would I abide, Were I againe vncaptiuy'd; But often haue I heard it say, Needs must that horse to hell away that the Deu'll rides on. I slept a while, but now I see That was thy charme and sorcerie, Ther-hence thou didst comence my foyle As Deere that's taken in a toyle, and so sent blind away. But since I see no remedie, I yeeld me to thy lenitie, Whereby both thou the Conqueror, And I thy poor Orator may honour enjoy. FINIS.</field>
