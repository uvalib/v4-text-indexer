      <field name="fulltext">No. 42. Oedipus (Incomplete) (Oedipus, Act I) [Scene 1.] Enter Oedipus attended, to the High Priest and a Train of Children &amp; Young Men who are kneiling before an Altar placed at the Gates of the Palace. Oed. What mean these solemn Rites, these plaintive Sounds? This Altar rear'd before my Palace Gates? This train of Suppliants clad in mournful Weeds And prostrate on the Ground? My Children speak, Unhappy Youths from royal Cadmus sprung, Why doth the Incense fume in every Street, And round us Groans and Lamentations rise? I could not stay to learn from other hands My People's Grief, a Partner in your woe I come my self, the far-fam'd Oedipus Your great Deliverer. But thou, good old man, Before whose reverend Age in decent awe These youths are silent, speak thou Holy Priest A Monarch is your Friend, whose heart bleeds for you And for his Thebans feels a Father's care. H. P. O Oedipus whose hand the Sceptre sways Of ancient Thebes, the Youths who lie before thee Are helpless Heirs of many a noble House, These aged Men devoted to the Gods, And I the Priest of mighty Jupiter. Our Citizens around Minerva's Shrines Implore her aid, or near the awful Tomb Where the dead bones of great Irmenus lie Burn fragrant Odours, and consult their Fate In his prophetick Flames. Thou see'st all Thebes Lies tossing like the tempest-beaten Bark Abandon'd to despair. The Fields are waste From barren Autumns, and a blighted Spring, A Murrain sweeps our Flocks and Herds away, And our sad Matrons o'er their dead-born Babes Lament their fruitless pain. A curse hangs o'er us A Fire devours us, a fierce Pestilence That secret walks unpeoples half our Tribes. And ev'ry hour with peals of Theban Groans Glads the grim King of Hell. We sue to Thee Not as a God, but as the first of Men, Belov'd of Heav'n and of the Gods inspir'd Whose Wisdome, not untry'd in evil days, From Sphinx the Monster sav'd th' afflicted Realm Once our Deliverer to the Gods again In pious supplication lift thy hands, And draw down thence the Knowledge and the cure Of all our Woes. Remember oh remember A Monarch's Grandeur in his People lies, They form his Pride in Peace, his Strength in War, And stand the firmest Rampart round a Throne. Oed. Too well, my Sons, I know and mourn your woes, If singly hard to be endur'd by You How then by Me, who in one breast sustain Your Griefs and mine, and feel for all the land! Think not oh think not that your piercing Cries Have broke my sleep, or chaced my pleasing Dreams. All night my Eyes have swom in tears, all night My Breast has heav'd with sorrows not my own. What could I do? Before the morning-dawn To great Apollo's Fane by my command My Brother Creon went to seek the God. Before the morning-dawn he went, and now Methinks he laggs; my mind impatient burns To know what Fate would have. Despise me, Thebes, Call me the worst, the vilest of mankind, If I not act or suffer for thy sake, For thy lov'd sake, whate'er the God decrees. H. P. With a blest voice and in a lucky hour The King names Creon. See he comes. Oed. He comes. Thou God of Wisdom, Regent of the Day, Glad be his Tidings as his Looks are glad. H. P. The Lawrels twin'd around his Brows declare His Tidings happy. Scene 2? Enter Creon Oed. Speak: what Answer, Creon. Cre. The Gods be prais'd, our woes are at an end Remove the Cause that brings the Curses down The guilty cause; so Heaven again shall smile And the glad Earth her wonted face renew. Oed. Name then, oh name that cause that guilty Cause Name it, and ease my lab'ring heart that pants With hopes and fears perplext. Cre. Within the Palace Shall I attend thee, Oedipus, or here Declare and Publish it? Oed. To the World declare it: Unmindful of my self, for these I mourn These helpless men; alas why should not they Who have the Evil, know the Comfort too! Cre. Thus warns the God, who bends the silver Bowe. Within the Realms of Thebes a Monster breathes. Detested by the Gods he taints the Air, And poisons all the Land. Oed. What means to heal it? Cre. Forth from your Frontiers drive th' accursed thing, Or spill in expiation Blood for Blood, His Blood who murder'd cries to Heav'n for vengeance And draws the rage of all the Gods upon us. Oed. Whose Blood? What Murder? Cre. Laius was our King, E'er Thebes bestow'd the Crown on you. Oed. Proceed. Cre. The Oracle this Punishment decrees To those who murder'd Laius. Oed. Where then are they? What place conceals them? and what human skill Can backward trace through years so dark a Deed? Cre. Here, even amongst us within these Walls they live, Who murder'd Laius: here they live unpunished: And Thebes is wretched by her own neglect. Oed. Far be that fault from Me. In Corinth born A Stranger to this luckless land I came Long after Laius perish'd. How he fell To me still seem'd a dark and puzzled Tale. Ill could I ask it of his widow'd Queen, My Wife; I spar'd Jocasta's Tears the question. But now, ye Thebans, 'tis the Publick care, Back let us search through ev'ry circumstance And trace it to the sourse. Speak who can tell When, where, and how fell Laius? Cre. Hence he went For Delphi bound, and perish'd on the way. Oed. Return'd not any of his Train? Cre. They too Fell with their Master. Only one escap'd By flight escap'd, and he could only tell One circumstance. Oed. What is that Circumstance? Oh one small ray, one feeble glimpse of light Oft proves sufficient to reveal a murder. Cre. He said the King was slain by multitudes By Robbers slain. Oed. A King! and slain by Robbers! Sure they were hir'd by Gold, and placed in ambush. Cre. Such was the general thought. But Ills on Ills Plague after Plague succeeding Laius' Death Prevented further search. Oed. What plagues alas, What Ills so great to make you slight a Murder And a King's murder too? Cre. The Monster Sphinx, That like a Torrent laid our Country waste, Allow'd not time to think of slighter woes. For certain Ills th' uncertain were o'erlook'd So hard to be found out. Oed. But, by the Gods They shall be found, and shall be found by me. Yes Phoebus, thy decrees shall be obey'd; Thy Second in this pious work I come, Whose piercing mind in Riddles not unskill'd The Ruffian shall pursue through every maze And expiate this sin-polluted Land. Not only for my Queen's and Kingdome's sake, But for my own, this Labour shall be mine Who knows but he, who dipt his hands profane In Laius' blood, by curst ambition fir'd, May take my Life! Revenge we then the Dead To guard the Living. Rise, my Children, rise. Swift let the Heralds march through every street, And summon Thebes in all her Tribes to meet me. No means shall pass untry'd, no hour delay'd, And if my Soul presage aright, this Day Shall heal our Sorrows, or shall end our Lives. [Exit Oedipus. H. P. Rise then my Children, and depart in peace. While we to great Apollo lift our Vows, To Him and ev'ry God in Thebes ador'd, And in the Confidence of prayer implore His Eye to guide us, and his Arm to save. [The Chorus, consisting of Priests advance upon the Stage. 1. Chor. Thou Oracle divine, the voice of Jove Pronounc'd by Phoebus from his golden Shrine In ancient Delphi, wherefore art thou come To poor afflicted Thebes? Speak Goddess-born Thou Son of smiling Hope, speak un-obscured Our future Fate. Alas! alas! my soul With Fears distracted, in Amazement lost, From Adoration only seeks relief. 2d. Pr. Thee, bold Minerva, whose accomplisht Form From Jove alone without a Mother sprung I first invoke, with Thee the other Maid Thy Sister Dian, whose fair Deity Presides o'er Thebes, and fills a stately Throne That high amid this ample City stands. Thee too the Bender of the Silver Bow Thee Phoebus I invoke; Appear ye Three Appear ye kind, ye Plague-dispelling Powers. Your help your wonted help to Thebes afford That bends and sinks beneath a thousand Woes. 3d. Pr. The sinking Nation faintly lifts her eye And looks around for aid, but looks in vain. The Earth grown weak a meagre Fruitage yields Pin'd e'er it ripens: with false hopes beguil'd Our pregnant Mothers die amid their Throes Unable to bring forth: on every side Corpse after Corpse drops down, Shade after Shade Swift as the nimble Lightning's glance, descends To Hell's tremendous Gloome. Unhappy Babes, Born e'er their time, all helpless on the ground Un-pity'd by their tender Parents lie: Their tender Parents hurry'd by despair For refuge to the sacred Altars run, Where the loud Hymns to great Apollo sung Confus'd with Groans ascend. 4. Pr. Thou blue-eyed Maid, Minerva come: lace on thy burnisht Helme, Before us spread thy adamantine Shield, And couch thy pointed Spear. Drive hence the God The cruel God, whose wide-destroying hand Lays heaps on heaps, and thins afflicted Thebes: Drive him reluctant to the Thracian shore, Where rowle the Euxine's hoarse-resounding waves Or in th' unfathom'd Ocean plunge him down Bound in eternal Chains. 5. Pr. Life-giving Jove! Who frown'st amid the Lightning's dreadful blaze Transfix him thy Thunder-bolts. 6. Pr. Thou too Fair God of Day! the keenest Arrow chase Off all that in thy golden Quiver lie, And bend thy Bowe for Thebes. 7. Pr. Diana too, In thy soft silver beams serene and mild, Smile on us: all ye Gods, propitious smile. 8. Pr. Thee Bacchus last thy Thebans sue forlorn, Thee Bacchus of a Theban Mother born. Hear and appear in all thy pomp confest, Thy gold Tiara and thy Indian Vest; Known by the Torches blazing from afar And frantic Matrons howling round thy Carr. That God who plagues this desolated Earth Expell, and save the Land that gave thee birth. End of the first Act. [There is a blank page here in the manuscript, and only a part of the conclusion of the tragedy is continued upon a separate sheet.] Cre. Tell, tell thy eager wish, and be obey'd. Oed. Then drive me instant from this Land accurst, Where I may hear the voice of Man no more. Cre. Consult we first the holy Oracles; Nor can I order till Apollo speaks. Oed. Too plain already hath he spoke my doom A Monster and a Paricide declar'd. Cre. Though he hath spoke, th' unsettled State requires That we consult his sacred shrines once more. Oed. Vain to consult them for a Wretch like me. Cre. Thy fortune, Prince, well justifies that search, A dreadful instance that the Gods speak truth. Oed. In pity, Creon, hear my last commands. See Her, the Clay-cold Corpse that lies within Lodg'd decent in some Sepulchre: to Thee This care of thy own Family belongs. Mean-while from Thebes, my Native Thebes I goe That well may spare a Citizen like me. Out-cast from hence oh let me rove alone On the bleak Mountain's barren Precipice, My own Cithaeron; there my wretched Sire, While yet he liv'd, my haplesse Mother there Ordain'd my Sepulchre. Oh thither send And where they first commanded, let me Die. I now perceive why safe through fields of Blood I've pass'd and breath'd un-hurt in tainted Air, Far greater Ills, and heavier loads of Woe Reserv'd: sad privilege! But be it so! Go on, ye Fates, and make your work complete. [End of the manuscript.] [Tickell papers.] No. 43. Caroline's Squirrel On mortal Blis no Mortal may rely As Kings and Heroes, Squirrels too must die. How soon, poor Bunny, are thy pleasures fled, The Day, that saw thee envy'd, mourns thee Dead. What can the Nymph's Caresses now avail? She stroak'd thy Furr and prais'd thy shadowy Tail, On her soft Lap she lull'd thee to thy Rest; She made thy pillow of her swelling Breast! She cull'd with care the Choice of ev'ry Tree, And thought the Filberts only grew for Thee! Why woud'st thou Die? why Life &amp; Love resign? When thou had'st Nuts enough and Caroline? As Death's cold damp his Heart began to chill, And his Pulse languish'd, and his Eyes stood still, Why are thy Gifts, fond Maid, so ill apply'd? On Death bestow'd to Life and Love deny'd? How blest were I, if in thy Fav'rite's stead, So lov'd when Living, and so mourn'd when Dead. As through the lonesome Glade in doleful Strains All night the childless Philomel complains, Oft round her empty Nest she fondly flies, Robb'd by rough Swains before the Mother's Eyes, Then on some blasted Bough renews her Lay, Resign'd to Grief, and sings her Soul away: So the sad Damsell wanders all alone, And mourns her pretty Minion dead and gone; Each once lov'd Object now renews her Rage, The lonely Window and the widow'd Cage, The half-crack'd Filberts scatter'd round the Floor, And the bright Chain the patient Captive wore; No more shall wear. By Fate's severe Decree The Hand of Death has set the captive free Indulgent Nature form'd him fit to roame, And gave the spacious Forest for his Home, Twixt Earth &amp; Skies his glorious Lot assign'd, And made him Rival of the Feather'd kind: Yet when ensnar'd by humane Wiles he fell, Meek he resign'd and bore his Fortune well, His lovely Keeper half consol'd his Woe, And reconcil'd him to these Realms below. He gently yielded to her sov'rain Pow'r, And bit his Mistresse only once an hour; So void of mischief that he us'd to break A China-Cup but twice three times a week, Or tore, poor Fellow! as his Fancy led, Her spotless Sassnet, and her Mechlen Head. Why would He die &amp;c. Thee, Bunny, thee e'en Pug thy Rival mourns, Sighs back thy Sighs, and Groan for Groan returns: For Thee the scarlet-bosom'd Linnet moans In ruffled Feathers, and un-finish'd Tones: For Thee poor Mopsy whindles round the Room, And pretty Poll and Abigal are dumb. Pensive She sits her knitting at a stand, Nor shoots her Shuttle through her wither'd Hand, Nor rails at Girls nor puzzles o'er the news, Nor spells Receits, as sober Huswives use; Ah! no Receit, in Kent's wise Countesse read, No Soupes, no Sauces, can revive the Dead. Why wou'd He Die &amp;c. And art thou Dead! for ever Dead and Cold! Poor Trifler! scarce two little Summers old. Past fourscore Years dull Aldermen survive, And Maiden Aunts look smug at Fifty-five: The plagues of Nature Time with pain destroys, But fleet and momentary are her Joys. So the curst Thistle and the Nettle rear Their hateful Heads, and flourish through the Year, But short the time the Virgin Snow-drop blows, And short the Fragrance of the blushing Rose; Their Pride, their Sweets, that with the Morn begun, Decline and wither in the Setting Sun. Yet cease, my Fair, to mourn his shorten'd Date. If Verse can live, and poets conquer Fate, Far distant Ages shall record his Fame, The lovely Fav'rite of the loveliest Dame. Like Lesbia's Sparrow sung by Roman Knights, Like Martial's Issa grac'd with Fun'ral Rites He too shall last: and future Bards compare The Squirrel's Tail with Berenice's Hair.

From the Cock-Pit A torn Fragment Far other Labours now demand my Time. Who from the Cock-pit ever writ in Rhyme? Here while my Mind more useful Paths pursues, No Gods I call on, and invoke no Muse; But grown more grave, affect a diff'rent Praise, The Style of Bus'ness and the Whitehall Phrase. Trembling I touch the Lyre, reluctant sing, And know what Cares the tuneful Sisters bring. My offspring in the Midnight Silence born, Review'd with vigour on th' approaching Morn, Oft fall unpity'd; and the work of Hours The pen-knife mangles or the Flame devours. Thrice happyâwhose prolific Brain Three Folios teem'd without one moment's pain, Whose un-repented Rhymes, fair Ludgate's Boast, No Blot e'er soil'd nor friendly Pencil crost. But one day scribbled, e'er anothers Dawn [Tickell papers.] No. 46. Prologue [See letters Addison to Tickell, Sept.-Oct. 1718] In this old Hall, say Holinshead and Stowe, Proud Wolsey din'd two hundred years ago. The Comick Muse now rears her Cheerful head Where Monks grew fat and rosy Abbots fed. No bad Exchange! Whate'er the Saints can say, Sure we are Christians full as good as They. Still to the Muses Heroes have been kind And Kings been glorious as the Arts refind For these young Ammon own'd his generous Flame From these Augustus borrow'd half his Fame. Such was their praise. Nor Thou that praise decline Majestick Leader of the Brunswick Line. Beneath thy Roof where Peace and Triumph reign. Let the Lyre warble, and the Lute complain But hence far hence, on the Sicilian Shore Let thy Drums echoe and thy Cannons roare How did thy Navy pass the Dreadful Waves Where Scylla foames and hoarse Charybdis raves! How did the Foe with anguish and surprize Behold new Ãtnas from the Billows rise âWhen Empty Boasts the Ocean's Lord offend, Such are the Answers British Monarchs send. Exploits like these adorn'd Eliza's Reign: That good old Maid took care to sweep the Main From the blest hour She saw th' Armada blaze, Came Peace and Wealth and Albions golden Days; With Strains of Triumph the glad Island rang, A Spenser carol'd and a Sidney sang; At home She Smild, abroad She sent her Rage, Drake sailed the Sea and Shakespear graced the Stage So may the brave Plantagents return, A Drake arise and new Armada's burn. ful King the Nations bind M and settle half Mankind Then may the grateful Britons seek repose, And taste ked the peace himself bestows. [Tickell papers.] No. 47. Cupid's Shaft 1 Through the smooth Fringe of shining Jett, The Edging round your Eye-lid set, His Bow the hidden Archer drew, And shot your destin'd Captive through. 2 Stung to the Soul, in vain he roves To Courts of Kings from silent Groves, In vain He mingles with the Throng: He bears th' invenom'd Shaft along. 3 Should he to Britain bid adieu, Still would Your fatal Form pursue, Climb up the Vessel's painted Side, Or with the winged Courser ride. 4 Whether your Slave shall drag his Chain Across the rough Hibernian Main, Or his unalter'd Breast shall beat In far Hesperia's sultry Heat. 5 Though foreign Nymphs may tempt his Eyes, Still shall Your conqu'ring Image rise, And teach to praise or slight the Fair As they Your lov'd Resemblance bear. [Tickell papers.] No. 48. Platonick Love Not for thy rosie bloom, alone, Or snowie neck, I die, Thy melting voice, thy tender smile, Or love-persuading eye. Oft have I gaz'd, unhurt, on Pride Lodg'd in a mould divine; Oft listen'd, safe, when Folly flow'd From lips as sweet as thine. The Soul, o're all thy frame diffus'd, Paints every feature fair, As Angels tinge their forms, at will, When limb'd in lucid air. Bright-beaming through thy shape appears The heavenly guest enshrin'd; 'Tis virtue, sure, to kiss the case, That holds so fair a mind. [Tickell papers.] No. 49. For England's Injured Church and Law [Addressed to Philip Duke of Wharton, who started the True Briton, a bi-weekly newspaper, on 3 June 1723] For England's injur'd Church and Law, Great Duke, the Patriot's Pen you draw, Our wasted Wealth, our impious Age, Your un-polluted Hand engage To snatch the wreaths that Gaylard crown'd, And Smedley's awful temples bound. Arm'd with pat parallels you come, And mottoes quaint from Greece &amp; Rome, To prove that Peers should never vary, Nor Leges Anglice mutari. Your Maximes old, your standing Jests, The Flowers of Journals and Protests, Shall Bounties force from Walpole's hand, Or Parker's Seal, or Pelham's wand. What Culprit's Widow shrill and sweet Hawks your True Briton through the Street? What 'Prentice shares your generous toil, Besmear'd with Ink, and strong of oil, Taught young, beneath his Fathers Roof To spell his words, and point his Proof, Taught young to stand his Author's cause, And thrid the Loop-holes of the Laws? What man is sure but Time may see Old Whiston in a smart ToupÃ© Sacheverell to the Lawn prefer'd, Or sweet Jack Hervey wear a beard, The Whigs from Rome invite a King, Or Thames run backward to his spring: When you Great Duke, of parts so rare, The Darling of the Gay and Fair, Oh shame! oh worst of all your Barters! Leave off your Viper-Broth and Chartres (Fashion'd by him for greater Evils) To herd with Booksellers and Devils? [Tickell papers.] No. 50. To Chloe Tell, whilst I gaze on Chloe, tell, What power my voice restrains, Why fears and doubts my bosom swell, And shiver through my veins. Nymphs less-desir'd my lips have learn'd Like other swains, to praise; For, where the Heart is unconcern'd, The Fancy freely plays. But Love, that dreads to meet her frown, In vain at Language tries, A fearful Child, by stammering known, Stolen looks, and downcast eyes. The wary Maid, who cold of heart, Such tokens disbelieves, Must think that Awe and Fear are Art, And Innocence deceives. [Tickell papers.] No. 51. The Cradled BritonThe cradled Briton, for the seas design'd Thrives on the waves, and hardens in the wind, Down from the Mast his childhood smiling spies The level ocean into mountains rise, He reads, an early book, the heavenly frame, And lisps each Constellation by it's name. Thus master of the stars that o're him glow He portions out the watry waste below. No. 52. From the Last Isle A Fragment From the last Isle, along whose shore extends The waste Atlantick, and where Europe ends, On whose wild plains, to ancient fame unknown, Nor Roman Arms, nor Grecian Science shone. [Tickell papers.] No. 53. Welcome to Prince Frederick A torn fragment The Muse's Task be this, with gentle art To tune the temper, and to sooth the Heart, The swelling Tides of Glory to assuage, And suit her offerings to thy growing Age In vain the Vulgar Great, to Titles born, Scorn'd by the Muses, Scorn repay with Scorn; In vain the dull of head, and cold of heart, As Banes to Business damp each graceful Art: Long live the Third of Brunswick's royal line, Long live the poet's prince and Thine Like him when young, among the Muses rove And trust the Thunder to the arm of Jove. Nor blame as rudely bold the Learned Band, Long cheer'd by Kings in polish'd Britain's land. Sydney &amp; Raleigh grac'd with deathless rays Elizas reign in Albion's golden days: Who boasts not more of Bacon, near the Throne Or, Charles, thy Hyde, or George, thy Addison? Old Saxon Alfred felt the pleasing fire Nor Lion-hearted Richard scorn'd the Lyre, The tuneful Hero oft on Judah's land To the sweet strings apply'd his martial hand Amidst the welcomes of thy Royal race, Thy Mother's smiles, they Father's fond embrace, The Senates homage, and the Land's acclaim A heart which joys the raptur'd Muse inflame Bold to retouch the Lute forgot so long And hail the Darling of our future Song. At length Britannia round her Monarch's throne Sees his whole House, and boasts it all her own. [Tickell papers.] No. 54. Happy the Land âThe following is a copy of the unfinished Poem alluded to in the Letter [Swift to Tickell, 20th July 1731.] A few of the lines in it were afterwards transposed into another Poem published by Mr. T.?ll &amp; addressed to a Lady on her Marriage.â [Note by Thomas Tickell, Letter Book, No. 2.] Happy the land, when Nobles plac'd on high In Arts and Virtues with plebeians vie, Their Fathers' honours who like Rivals view, Nor boast old titles, till they merit new. By fame, not fortune, led, in posts to shine, They take them trembling, but with pride resign. His course through clouds achiev'd, the patriot mind Slow-setting leaves a track of light behind: Silent and sole he stands amid the grove An awfull figure, like Dodona's Jove; From him the anxious nations ask their doom, Priz'd in his lustre, worship'd in his gloom. Not so thy Lords, o France, degenerate race Of Freemen towering o'er a court's disgrace, Whose dangerous virtue, by strong chains secur'd, The dungeon swallow'd, or the fort immur'd. Their sons, offending, meet a meaner fate; Driven home in exile from the palace-gate, Their hapless fall, wives, kinsmen, friends, deplore, Dead to the Court, and bondmen now no more. Pensive and sad see large-soul'd CondÃ© roves Like a fallen angel through Chantilli's groves! In Bussi's lawns see Rabutin, by turns, Weeps, sings, and rages, menaces, and mourns; Round his paternal hills his flocks are fed, His vineyards redden, and his forests spread, His day the chase, his night gay balls employ, The gliding damsel, and the warbling boy, And wit, life's life. Beneath unsully'd skies Free to his range all fair Burgundia lies: The interdicted Court still haunts his head, His mid-day dream, the vision of his bed; Sick of the rural bower, his sovereign's grace The Exile covets, and the Favorite's place; The Favorite covets, sick of slippery power, The Exile's freedom, and the rural bower. Scorn'd be the man, all dazzling in his state, Beneath my envy, and not worth my hate, Who proud to govern, not too proud to crave, O'er others lording, knows himself a slave, And, poorly swell'd with secondary sway, Still fear'd, and fearing, trembles life away. The joys that Equals best with Equals share, The mutual Secret, the divided Care. He never tastes. Ill-plac'd his peers above, Too Great for friendship, and too Rich for love, He views his purchas'd Levee with alarms, And Beauty lies un-trusted in his arms. Though Safety whispering warn him to retreat, Though Freedom beckon to the sylvan seat, From the safe harbour to the faithless Main The Syren Grandeur sings him back again. Short are thy splendours and thy service hard, And what, great Goddess, giv'st thou in reward! Impartial Nature fram'd with like desires Affected Courtiers, and voracious Squires; To mortal man, of small or great expenses, She gave One stomach, and but just Five senses; With this plain rule their appetites to still, The full to empty, and the empty fill. But we, as all sorrows were too few, Acquire strange wants, that nature never knew. In grief behold the envy'd statesman drownd! His Title ends not in a graceful Sound. From his soft couch the midnight slumbers flie! He wants a Ribon of a nobler Die. From goblets high-emboss'd his wine must glide; Round his Clos'd sight the gorgeous curtains slide; On his heap'd board th' inverted seasons rise; And Three Untasted courses glut his Eyes. For this are Friendship's gentle calls withstood, The voice of Conscience and the bonds of Blood, This, Wisdom, thy reward for every pain, And this, gay Glory, all thy mighty gain. And yet just Curse on Man's aspiring kind Prone to Ambition, to Example Blind Our Childrens Children shall our Steps pursue And the same Errors be for ever new. Grant him possest of all he covets most, The Banker's vision, and the Herald's boast; Compare we then the future with the past, And judge if this can stand, or that can last. In pomp beyond compare thy throne, Peru, Thy swarming Towns, our fathers' grandsires knew; Thy ruines now in vain the eye explores, Thrice ten degrees, along the lonely shores. Where are thy Tribes, that with the world begun? Where now thy Ynca's, lineal from the Sun? Where shall their Heir, their high-born Heir, be found? He pants, perhaps a Hireling under ground, The Brother of the Stars ne'er sees them shine, For life a Beggar in the golden mine. From that new world, ah why? to curse the old The Spaniard first brought pestilence and gold, A shining mischief, by some wanton power Bestow'd on mortals in an evil hour. Ten thousand fathom hid from human sight, The sad Peruvian heaves it up to light: O'er Europe spread, the source of every wrong, It reigns despotick, but it reigns not long: Across the Ganges sent, but sent in vain, The Indian Omrah buries it again. Thus Earth's insatiate sons shall still be poor; She, ever ransack'd ever keeps her store, And mocks alike, resuming what she gave, The Eastern Visir, and the Western Slave. [Tickell papers.] No. 55. Yes Belvidera Yes! Belvidera, your Disdain Gives my back my heart to me As first your Favour wound my chain Your Rigour sets me free No joy, that once my soul beguil'd, My memory shall wound, Nor will I think how sweet you smil'd, But how severe you Frown'd. Your cruel look, your scornful air My fancy shall possess, And as I paint you still less fair, I'll learn to love you less. My Waxen heart, when near the Flame, Yields to th' imprinted mould, But know, forgetful faithless Dame, It hardens in the Cold. [Tickell papers.] No. 56. To the Duke of Devonshire The Petition of John Ward In Terms most humble presents to your Grace His very small Fortune and very hard case; That oft disappointed on none he depends But is left to the world without Merit, or Friends. Unacquainted with Parties unknown to the Great, Unaccustomed to Toil yet the Pastime of Fate, Forsaken of all, all Methods he tries, If ought may avail, to make himself rise Yet ventures with Modesty so near your Throne In Talk a meer Stranger, by Sight scarcely known Whose only Estate is exalted so high, Dull Mortals despise it, as plac'd in the Sky, For Wits, let their Fame be as great as they will Are the Offspring of Sloth and Poverty still, Ennur'd to no Trade, and brought up to no Art, Not help'd by Relations, nor crown'd with Desert, To Mankind in vain I might sue for Redress, None know my Occasions, and few Men will guess. In State most desponding, by the Light of a Taper, With Thoughts dull and dark as my Wax, or my Paper, Yet still most submissive, I come to your Grace, In Accents most modest to beg some small Place. Some pretty neat Portion in th' Army, or State, For Life not too small, nor for Virtue too great. That blest with such easy and competent Wealth, I might drink once a Day your Lordship's good health, And put in so even, sufficient a way, I should scorn to flatter for Love, or for Pay. Oh! might I once get a Subsistence so fair, I'd write no more Rhimes, nor build Tow'rs in the Air, The Faults of my Youth, and my Life I'd reclaim, Nor, knowing more Guilt, wou'd be curst with more Shame, I'd sit down in quiet, in no false Man trust, In all my Thoughts, calm, in all Actions, just, The Slanders of Hate and of Pride I'd defy, No Mortal, my Lord, wou'd be more blest than I Ev'n pleas'd with the Hope, I already prepare To dispel my sad Gloom, &amp; to banish my Care,â Oh! might I behold that most fortunate Day, Your Grace's most thankful, for ever shou'd pray. John Ward. [Tickell papers.]</field>
