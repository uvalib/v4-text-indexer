      <field name="fulltext">SATIRES, ODES, SONGS, And other Poems OF THE RIGHT HON. GEORGE CANNING, M.P. THE SLAVERY OF GREECE. Unrivall'd Greece! thou ever honor'd name, Thou nurse of heroes dear to deathless fame! Though now to worth, to honor all unknown, Thy lustre faded, and thy glories flown; Yet still shall Memory, with reverted eye, Trace thy past worth, and view thee with a sigh. Thee Freedom cherish'd once with fostering hand, And breath'd undaunted valour through the land; Here, the stern spirit of the Spartan soil, The child of poverty, inur'd to toil. Here, lov'd by Pallas and the sacred Nine, Once did fair Athens' tow'ring glories shine, To bend the bow, or the bright faulchion wield, To lift the bulwark of the brazen shield, To toss the terror of the whizzing spear, The conqu'ring standard's glitt'ring glories rear, And join the mad'ning battle's loud career. How skill'd the Greeks; confess what Persians slain Were strew'd on Marathon's ensanguin'd plain; When heaps on heaps the routed squadron fell, And with their gaudy myriads peopled hell. What millions bold Leonidas withstood, And seal'd the Grecian freedom with his blood; Witness Thermopylæ! how fierce he trod! How spoke a hero, and how mov'd a God! The rush of nations could alone sustain, While half the ravag'd globe was arm'd in vain. Let Leuctra say, let Mantinea tell, How great Epaminondas fought and fell! Nor war's vast art alone adorn'd thy fame, “But mild philosophy endear'd thy name.” Who knows not, sees not with admiring eye, How Plato thought, how Socrates could die? To bend the arch to bid the column rise, And the tall pile aspiring pierce the skies; The awful scene magnificently great, With pictur'd pomp to grace, and sculptur'd state, This science taught; on Greece each science shone: Here the bold statue started from the stone; Here, warm with life, the swelling canvass glow'd; Here, big with life, the poet's raptures flow'd; Here Homer's lip was touch'd with sacred fire, And wanton Sappho tun'd her am'rous lyre; Here bold Tyrtæus rous'd th' enervate throng Awak'd to glory by th' inspiring song; Here Pindar soar'd a nobler, loftier way, And brave Alcæus, scorn'd a tyrant's sway; Here gorgeous Tragedy, with great controul, Touch'd every feeling of th' impassion'd soul; While in soft measure tripping to the song, Her comic sister lightly danc'd along— This was thy state! But oh! how chang'd thy fame, And all thy glories fading into shame. What! that thy bold, thy freedom-breathing land, Should crouch beneath a tyrant's stern command; That servitude should bind in galling chain; Whom Asia's millions once oppos'd in vain, Who could have thought? Who sees without a groan, Thy cities mould'ring and thy walls o'erthrown? That where once tower'd the stately solemn fane, Now moss-grown ruins strew the ravag'd plain; And unobserv'd but by the traveller's eye Proud vaulted domes in fretted fragments lie; And thy fall'n column on the dusty ground, Pale ivy throws its sluggish arms around. Thy sons (sad change!) in abject bondage sigh; Unpitied toil, and unlamented die; Groan at the labours of the galling oar, Or the dark caverns of the mine explore. The glitt'ring tyranny of Othman's sons, The pomp of horror which surrounds their thrones Has aw'd their servile spirits into fear; Spurn'd by the foot, they tremble and revere. The day of labour, night's sad sleepless hour, Th' inflictive scourge of arbitrary pow'r, The bloody terror of the pointed steel, The murd'rous stake, the agonizing wheel, And (dreadful choice!) the bow-string or the bowl, Damps their faint vigour, and unmans the soul. Disastrous fate! still tears will fill the eye, Still recollection prompt the mournful sigh, When to thy mind recurs thy former fame, And all the horrors of thy present shame. So some tall rock, whose bare broad bosom high, Tow'rs from th' earth, and braves th' inclement sky; On whose vast top the blackening deluge pours, At whose wide base the thund'ring ocean roars; In conscious pride its huge gigantic form Surveys imperious, and defies the storm. Till worn by age and mould'ring to decay, Th' insidious waters wash its base away; It falls, and falling cleaves the trembling ground, And spreads a tempest of destruction round. THE FRIEND OF HUMANITY, AND THE KNIFE-GRINDER. 1797. FRIEND OF HUMANITY. “Needy Knife-grinder! whether are you going? Rough is the road, your wheel is out of order— Bleak blows the Blast;—your hat has got a hole in't, So have your breeches! “Weary Knife-grinder! little think the proud ones Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike- -road, what hard work 'tis crying all day, ‘Knives and ‘Scissars to grind O!’ “Tell me Knife-grinder, how came you to grind knives? Did some rich man tyrannically use you? Was it the squire? or parson of the parish; Or the attorney? “Was it the squire, for killing of his game? or Covetous parson, for his tithes distraining? Or roguish lawyer, made you lose your little All in a lawsuit? “(Have you not read the Rights of Man, by Tom Paine?) Drops of compassion tremble on my eyelids, Ready to fall, as soon as you have told your Pitiful story.” KNIFE-GRINDER. “Story! God bless you! I have none to tell, Sir, Only last night a-drinking at the Chequers, This poor old hat and breeches, as you see, were Torn in a scuffle. “Constables came up for to take me into Custody; they took me before the justice; Justice Oldmixon put me in the parish- stocks for a vagrant. “I should be glad to drink your Honor's health in A pot of beer, if you will give me sixpence; But for my part, I never love to meddle With Politics, Sir.” FRIEND OF HUMANITY. “I give thee sixpence! I will see thee damn'd first— Wretch! whom no sense of wrongs can rouse to vengeance— Sordid, unfeeling, reprobate, degraded, Spiritless outcast!” Kicks the Knife-grinder, overturns his wheel, and exit in a transport of Republican enthusiasm and universal philanthropy. NEW MORALITY. 1798 From mental mists to purge a nation's eyes; To animate the weak, unite the wise; To trace the deep infection, that prevades The crowded town, and taints the rural shades; To mark how wide extends the mighty waste O'er the fair realms of Science, Learning, Taste; To drive and scatter all the brood of lies, And chase the varying falsehood as it flies; The long arrears of ridicule to pay, To drag reluctant Dulness back to day; Much yet remains.—To you these themes belong, Ye favor'd sons of virtue and of song! Say, is the field too narrow? Are the times Barren of folly, and devoid of crimes? Yet, venial vices, in a milder age, Could rouse the warmth of Pope's satiric rage; The doting miser, and the lavish heir, The follies, and the foibles of the fair, Sir Job, Sir Balaam, and old Euclio's thrift, And Sappho's diamonds, with her dirty shift, Blunt, Charteris, Hopkins;—meaner subjects fired The keen-eyed Poet;—while the Muse inspired Her ardent child—entwining as he sate, His laurell'd chaplet with the thorns of hate. But say,—indignant does the Muse retire, Her shrine deserted, and extinct its fire? No pious hand to feed the sacred flame, No raptured soul a Poet's charge to claim. Bethink thee (Gifford); when some future age Shall trace the promise of thy playful page;— “ See the motto prefixed to “The Baviad,” a satirical poem by W. Gifford, Esq. unquestionably the best of its kind since the days of Pope: ? Nunc in ovilia Mox in reluctantes dracones.The hand which brush'd a swarm of fools away, “Should rouse to grasp a more reluctant prey!”— Think then, will pleaded indolence excuse The tame secession of thy languid Muse? Ah! where is now that promise? Why so long Sleep the keen shafts of satire and of song? Oh! come with Taste and Virtue at thy side, With ardent zeal inflamed, and patriot pride; With keen poetic glance direct the blow, And empty all thy quiver on the foe: No pause—no rest—till weltering on the ground The poisonous hydra lies, and pierced with many a wound. Thou too!—the nameless Bard The author of the “Pursuits of Literature.”,—whose honest zeal For law, for morals, for the public weal, Pours down impetuous on thy country's foes The stream of verse, and many-languaged prose; Thou too!—though oft thy ill-advised dislike The guiltless head with random censure strike,— Though quaint allusions, vague and undefined, Play faintly round the ear, but mock the mind; Through the mix'd mass yet taste and learning shine, And manly vigour stamps the nervous line; And patriot warmth the generous rage inspires; And wakes and points the desultory fires! Yet more remain unknown: for who can tell What bashful genius, in some rural cell, As year to year, and day succeeds to day, In joyless leisure wastes his life away? In him the flame of early fancy shone; His genuine worth his old companions own; In childhood and in youth their chief confess'd, His master's pride, his pattern to the rest. Now far aloof retiring from the strife Of busy talents and of active life, As from the loop-holes of retreat, he views Our stage, verse, pamphlets, politics, and news, He loathes the world,—or, with reflection sad, Concludes it irrecoverably mad; Of taste, of learning, morals, all bereft, No hope, no prospect to redeem it, left. Awake! for shame! or ere thy nobler sense Sink in the oblivious pool of indolence! Must wit be found alone on falsehood's side, Unknown to truth, to virtue unallied? Arise! nor scorn thy country's just alarms; Wield in her cause thy long neglected arms; Of lofty satire pour the indignant strain, Leagued with her friends, and ardent to maintain 'Gainst Learning's, Virtue's, Truth's, Religion's foes, A kingdom's safety, and the world's repose. If Vice appal thee,—if thou view with awe Insults that brave, and crimes that 'scape the law;— Yet may the specious bastard brood, which claim A spurious homage under Virtue's name, Sprung from that parent of ten thousand crimes, The new Philosophy of modern times,— Yet, these may rouse thee!—With unsparing hand, Oh, lash the vile impostors from the land! First, stern Philanthropy:—not she, who dries The orphan's tears, and wipes the widow's eyes; Not she, who sainted Charity her guide, Of British bounty pours the annual tide:— But French Philanthropy;—whose boundless mind Glows with the general love of all mankind;— Philanthropy,—beneath whose baneful sway Each patriot passion sinks, and dies away. Taught in her school t'imbibe thy mawkish strain Condorcet filter'd through the dregs of Paine, Each pert adept disowns a Briton's part, And plucks the name of England from his heart. What, shall, a name, a word, a sound controul The aspiring thought, and cramp the expansive soul? Shall one half-peopled Island's rocky round A love, that glows for all Creation, bound? And social charities contract the plan Framed for thy Freedom, universal man? —No—through the extended globe his feelings run As broad and general as the unbounded sun! No narrow bigot he;—his reason'd view Thy interests, England, rank with thine, Peru! France at our doors, he sees no danger nigh, But heaves for Turkey's woes the impartial sigh; A steady Patriot of the World alone, The Friend of every Country—but his own. Next comes a gentler Virtue.—Ah! beware Lest the harsh verse her shrinking softness scare, Visit her not too roughly;—the warm sigh Breathes on her lips;—the tear-drop gems her eye. Sweet Sensibility, who dwells enshrined In the fine foldings of the feeling mind; With delicate Mimosa's sense endued, Who shrinks instinctive from a hand too rude; Or, like the Anagallis, prescient flower, Shuts her soft petals at the approaching shower. Sweet child of sickly Fancy!—her of yore From her loved France Rousseau to exile bore; And while midst lakes and mountains wild he ran, Full of himself, and shunn'd the haunts of man, Taught her o'er each lone vale and alpine steep To lisp the story of his wrongs, and weep; Taught her to cherish still in either eye, Of tender tears a plentiful supply, And pour them in her brooks that babbled by;— —Taught by nice scale to meet her feelings strong, False by degrees, and exquisitely wrong;— —For the crush'd beetle first,—the widow'd dove, And all the warbled sorrows of the grove;— Next for poor suffering guilt;—and last of all, For Parents, Friends, a king and Country's fall. Mark her fair votaries, prodigal of grief, With cureless pangs, and woes that mock relief, Droop in soft sorrow Vide Sentimental Journey. o'er a faded flower O'er a dead jack-ass pour the pearly shower;— But hear, unmoved, of Loire's ensanguined flood, Choked up with slain;—of Lyons drench'd in blood; Of crimes that blot the age, the world with shame, Foul crimes, but sicklied o'er with Freedom's name; Altars and thrones subverted, social life Trampled to earth,—the husband from the wife, Parent from child, with ruthless fury torn;— Of talents, honour, virtue, wit, forlorn, In friendless exile,—of the wise and good Staining the daily scaffold with their blood.— Of savage cruelties, that scare the mind, The rage of madness with hell's lust combin'd— Of hearts torn reeking from the mangled breast,— They hear—and hope, that all is for the best. Fond hope!—but Justice sanctifies the prayer— Justice!—here, Satire, strike! 'twere sin to spare! Not she in British Courts that takes her stand, The dawdling balance dangling in her hand, Adjusting punishments to fraud and vice, With srupulous quirks, and disquisition nice— But firm, erect, with keen reverted glance, The avenging angel of regenerate France, Who visits ancient sins on modern times, And punishes the Pope for Cæsar's crimes. The names of Vercengetorix are supposed to have been very much gratified by the invasion of Italy, and the plunder of the Roman territory. The defeat of the Burgundians is to be revenged on the modern inhabitants of Switzerland. But the Swiss were a free people, defending their liberties against a tyrant. Moreover, they happened to be in alliance with France at the time. No matter, Burgundy is since become a province of France, and the French have acquired a property in all the injuries and defeats which the people of that country may have sustained, together with the title to revenge and retaliation to be exercised in the present or any future centuries, as may be found most glorious and convenient. Such is the liberal Justice which presides In these our days, and modern patriot's guides; Justice, whose blood-stain'd book one sole decree, One statute fills—“The People shall be free.” Free by what means?—by folly, madness, guilt, By bounteous rapines, blood in oceans spilt; By confiscation, in whose sweeping toils The poor man's pittance with the rich man's spoils, Mix'd in one common mass, are swept away, To glut the short liv'd tyrant of the day:— By laws, religion, morals, all o'erthrown; Rouse then, ye sovereign people, claim your own: The licence that enthrals, the truth that blinds, The wealth that starves you, and the power that grinds. So Justice bids.—'Twas her enlighten'd doom, Louis, thy holy head devoted to the tomb! 'Twas Justice claim'd, in that accursed hour, The fatal forfeit of too lenient power. Mourn for the Man we may; but for the King,— Freedom, oh! Freedom's such a charming thing! “Much may be said on both sides.”—Hark! I hear A well known voice that murmurs in my ear,— The voice of Candour.—Hail! most solemn sage, Thou drivelling virtue of this moral age, Candour, which softens party's headlong rage. Candour,—which spares its foes;—nor e'er descends With bigot zeal to combat for its friends. Candour,—which loves in see-saw strain to tell Of acting foolishly, but meaning well; Too nice to praise by wholesale, or to blame, Convinced that all men's motives are the same; And finds, with keen discriminating sight, Black's not so black; nor white so very white. “Fox, to be sure, was vehement and wrong; But then Pitt's words you'll own were rather strong Both must be blamed, both pardon'd;—'twas just so With Fox and Pitt full forty years ago; So Walpole, Pulteney;—factions in all times, Have had their follies, ministers their crimes.” Give me the avow'd, the erect, the manly foe, Bold I can meet—perhaps may turn his blow; But of all plagues, good heaven, thy wrath can send, Save, save, oh! save me from the Candid Friend! “Barras loves plunder,—Merlin takes a bride,— What then?—shall Candour these good men proscribe. No! ere we join the loud-accusing throng, Prove—not the facts—but that they thought them wrong. “Why hang O'Quigley?—he, misguided man, In sober thought his country's weal might plan. And, while his deep-wrought treason sapp'd the throne, Might act from taste in morals all his own.” Peace to such Reasoners!—let them have their way Shut their dull eyes against the blaze of day. Priestley's a Saint, and Stone a patriot still! And La Fayette a Hero, if they will. I love the bold uncompromising mind, Whose principles are fix'd, whose views defined: Who scouts and scorns, in canting Candour's spite, All taste in morals, innate sense of right, And Nature's impulse, all uncheck'd by art, And feelings fine, that float about the heart; Content, for good men's guidance, bad men's awe, On moral truth to rest, and Gospel law. Who owns, when Traitor's feel the avenging rod, Just retribution, and the hand of God; Who hears the groans through Olmutz' roofs that ring, Of him who mock'd, misled, betray'd his King— Hears unappall'd:—though Faction's zealots preach— Unmov'd, unsoften'd by F?tzp?tr?ck's speech. —That speech The speech of General F?tzp?tr?ck, on his motion for an address of the House of Commons to the Emperor of Germany, to demand the deliverance of M. La Fayette from the prison of Olmutz, was one of the most dainty pieces of oratory that ever drew tears from a crowded gallery, and the clerks at the table. It was really quite moving to hear the General talk of religion, conjugal fidelity, and “such branches of learning.” There were a few who laughed indeed, but that was thought hard-hearted and immoral, and irreligious, and God knows what. Crying was the order of the day. Why will not Opposition try these topics again? La Fayette indeed (the more's the pity) is out. But why not a motion for a general gaol-delivery of all State Prisoners throughout Europe? on which the melting Commons hung, “While truths divine came mended from his tongue.” How loving husband clings to duteous wife,— How pure religion soothes the ills of life,— How Popish ladies trust their pious fears And naughty actions in their chaplain's ears. Half novel and half sermon on it flow'd; With pious zeal the Opposition glow'd; And as o'er each the soft infection crept, Sigh'd as he whined, and as he whisper'd wept; E'en C?w?n Now all the while did not this stony-hearted cur shed one tear. —Merchant of Venice. dropt a sentimental tear, And stout St. A?dr?w yelp'd a softer “Hear!” O! nurse of crimes and fashions! which in vain Our colder servile spirits would attain, How do we ape thee, France! but blundering still Disgrace the pattern by our want of skill. The borrow'd step our awkward gait reveals: (As clumsy C?rtn?y This is a serious charge against an Author, and ought to be well supported. To the proof, then! In an Ode of the late Lord Nugent's, are the following spirited lines, “Though Cato lived—though Tully spoke— “Though Brutus dealt the godlike stroke, “Yet perish'd fated Rome!” The Author above-mentioned, saw these lines, and liked them—as well he might: and as he had a mind to write about Rome himself, he did not scruple to enlist them into his service; but he thought it right to make a small alteration in their appearance, which he managed thus—Speaking of Rome, he says it is the place. “Where Cato lived”— A sober truth: which gets rid at once of all the poetry and spirit of the original, and reduces the sentiment from an example of manners, virtue, patriotism, from the vitæ exempla dedit of Lord Nugent, to a mere question of inhabitancy. Ubi habitavit Cato—where he was an inhabitant-householder, paying scot and lot, and had a house on the right hand side of the way, as you go down by Esquiline Hill, just opposite to the poulterers. But to proceed— “Where Cato lived; where Tully spoke, “Where Brutus dealt the godlike stroke— —“By which his glory rose!!!” The last line is not borrowed. We question whether the History of modern Literature can produce an instance of a theft so shameless, and turned to so little advantage. mars the verse he steals:) How do we ape thee, France!—nor claim alone Thy arts, thy tastes, thy morals for our own, But to thy Worthies render homage due, Their See Recit de mes Perils, by Louvet; Memoires d'un Detenu, by Riouffe, &amp;c. The avidity with which these productions were read, might, we should hope, be accounted for upon principles of mere curiosity (as we read the Newgate Calendar, and the history of the Buccaneers), not from any interest in favour of a set of wretches infinitely more detestable than all the robbers and pirates that ever existed. “hair-breadth 'scapes” with anxious interest view; Statesmen and heroines whom this age adores, Tho' plainer terms would call them rogues and w????s.

In Lodoiska's full possession blest, One craving void still aches within his breast; Plunged in the filth and fondness of her arms, Not to himself alone he stints her charms; Clasp'd in each other's fond embrace they lie, But know no joy, unless the world stands by. —The fool of vanity, for her alone He lives, loves, writes, and dies but to be known. His widow'd mourner flies to poison's aid Eager to join her Louvet's parted shade In those bright realms where sainted lovers stray, But harsh emetics tear that hope away. Every lover of modern French literature, and admirer of modern French characters, must remember the rout which was made about Louvet's death, and Lodoiska's poison. The attempt at self-slaughter, and the process of the recovery, the arsenic, and the castor oil, were served up in daily messes from the French papers, till the public absolutely sickened. —Yet hapless Louvet! where thy bones are laid, The easy nymphs shall consecrate the shade. Faciles Napeæ There, in the laughing morn of genial spring, Unwedded pairs shall tender couplets sing; Eringoes, o'er the hallow'd spot shall bloom, And flies of Spain buzz softly round the tomb.

Fain would the Muse—but ah! she dares no more, A mournful voice from lone Guyana's shore. These lines contain the secret History of Quatremer's deportation. He presumed in the Council of Five Hundred to arraign Madame de Stael's conduct, and even to hint a doubt of her sex. He was sent to Guyana. The transaction naturally brings to one's mind the dialogue between Falstaff and Hostess Quickly in Shakspeare's Henry IV. Fal. Thou art neither fish nor flesh—a man cannot tell where to have thee. Quick Thou art an unjust man for saying so—thou or any man knows where to have me. —Sad Quatremer—the bold presumption checks, Forbid to question thy ambitious sex. To thee, proud Barras bows;—thy charms controul Rewbell's brute rage, and Merlin's subtle soul; Raised by thy hands, and fashion'd to thy will, Thy power, thy guiding influence, governs still, Where at the blood-stain'd board expert he plies, The lame artificer of fraud and lies He with the mitred head and cloven heel; Doom'd the coarse edge of Rewbell's jests to feel For instance, in the course of a political discussion Rewbell observed to the Ex-bishop—“that his understanding was as crooked as his legs”—“Vil Emigre, tu n'as pas le sens plus droit que les pieds,”—and there withal threw an inkstand at him. It whizzed along, as we have been informed, like the fragment of a rock from the hand of one of Ossian's heroes:—but the wily apostate shrunk beneath the table, and the weapon passed over his innocuous and guiltless of his blood or brains.; To stand the playful buffet, and to hear The frequent ink-stand whizzing past his ear; While all the five directors laugh to see “The limping priest so deft at his new ministry.” See Homer's description of Vulcan.

The men without a God—one of the new sects.—Their religion is intended to consist in the adoration of a Great Book, in which all the virtuous actions of the Society are to be entered and registered. “In times of Civil Commotion they are to come forward, to exhort the Citizens to unanimity, and to read them a chapter out of the Great Book. When oppressed or proscribed, they are to retire to a burying-ground, to wrap themselves up in their great coats, and wait the approach of death.” &amp;c.

Thy peace, thy strength, with devilish wiles assail, And when her arms are vain, by arts prevail. True, thou art rich, art powerful! through thine Isle Industrious skill, contented labour smile; Far seas are studded with thy countless sails; What wind but wafts them, and what shore but hails! True, thou art brave!—o'er all the busy land In patriot ranks embattled myriads stand; Thy foes behold with impotent amaze, And drop the lifted weapon as they gaze! But what avails to guard each outward part, If subtlest poison, circling at thy heart, Spite of thy courage, of thy power, and wealth Mine the sound fabric of thy vital health? So thine own Oak, by some fair streamlet's side Waves its broad arms, and spreads its leafy pride, Towers from the earth, and rearing to the skies Its conscious strength, the tempest's wrath defies: Its ample branches shield the fowls of air, To its cool shades the panting herds repair. The treacherous current work its noiseless way, The fibres loosen and the roots decay; Prostrate the beauteous ruin lies; and all That shared its shelter, perish in its fall. O thou!—lamented Sage!—whose prescient scan Pierced through foul Anarchy's gigantic plan, Prompt to incredulous hearers to disclose The guilt of France, and Europe's world of woes: The mighty sea-mark of these troubled days! Thou, on whose name each distant age shall gaze, O large of soul, of genius unconfined, Born to delight, instruct, and mend mankind; Burke! in whose breast a Roman ardour glow'd; Whose copious tone with Grecian richness flow'd; Well hast thou found (if such thy Country's doom) A timely refuge in the sheltering tomb! As far as realms, where Eastern kings are laid, In pomp of death, beneath the cypress shade, The perfumed lamp with unextinguish'd light Flames thro' the vault, and cheers the gloom of night. So, mighty Burke! in thy sepulchral urn, To fancy's view, the lamp of Truth shall burn. Thither late times shall turn their reverent eyes, Led by thy light, and by thy wisdom wise. There are, to whom (their taste such pleasures cloy) No light thy wisdom yields, thy wit no joy. Peace to their heavy heads, and callous hearts, Peace—such as sloth, as ignorance imparts!— Pleased may they live to plan their Country's good, And crop, with calm content, their flow'ry food! What though thy venturous spirit loved to urge The labouring theme to Reason's utmost verge, Kindling and mounting from the enraptured sight;— Still anxious wonder watch'd thy darling flight! While vulgar minds, with mean malignant stare, Gazed up, the triumph of thy fall to share! Poor triumph! price of that extorted praise, Which still to daring Genius Envy pays. Oh! for thy playful smile,—thy potent frown,— To abash bold Vice, and laugh pert folly down! So should the Muse in Humour's happiest vein, With verse that flow'd in metaphoric strain, And apt allusions to the rural trade, Tell of what wood young Jacobins are made; How the skill'd Gardener grafts with nicest rule The slip of Coxcomb, on the stock of fool; Forth in bright blossom bursts the tender sprig, A thing to wonder at, i. e. Perhaps a Member of the Whig Club—a Society that has presumed to monopolize to itself a title to which it never had any claim, but from the character of those who have now withdrawn themselves from it. “Perhaps” signifies that even the Whig Club sometimes rejects a candidate, whose principles (risum teneatis) it affects to disapprove. perhaps a Whig, Should tell, how wise each half-fledged pedant prates Of weightiest matter, grave distinctions, states— That rules of policy, and public good, In Saxon times were rightly understood; That Kings are proper, may be useful things, But then some Gentlemen object to Kings; That in all times the Minister's to blame; That British Liberty's an empty name, Till each fair burgh, numerically free, Shall choose its Members by the Rule of Three. So should the Muse, with verse in thunder clothed, Proclaim the crimes by God and Nature loathed. Which—(when fell poison revels in the veins— That poison fell, which frantic Gallia drains From the crude fruit of Freedom's blasted tree) Blots the fair records of Humanity. To feebler nations let proud France afford Her damning choice,—the chalice or the sword,— To drink or die; oh fraud! oh specious lie! Delusive choice! for if they drink, they die. The sword we dread not: of ourselves secure, Firm were our strength, our Peace and Freedom sure, Let all the world confederate all its powers, “Be they not back'd by those that should be ours,” High on his rock shall Britain's Genius stand, Scatter the crowded hosts, and vindicate the land. Guard we but our own hearts: with constant view To ancient morals, ancient manners true, True to their manlier virtues, such as nerved Our father's breasts, and this proud Isle preserved For many a rugged age:—and scorn the while,— Each philosophic atheist's specious guile— The soft seductions, the refinements nice, Of gay morality, and easy vice: So shall we brave the storm: our 'stablish'd power Thy refuge, Europe, in some happier hour. But, French in heart—tho' victory crowns our brow, Low at our feet though prostrate nations bow, Wealth gild our cities, commerce crown our shore London may shine, but England is no more. THE PILOT THAT WEATHER'D THE STORM. (A Song, written in 1802.) If hush'd the loud whirlwind that ruffled the deep, The sky, if no longer dark tempests deform; When our perils are past, shall our gratitude sleep? No!—Here's to the Pilot who weather'd the storm! At the foot-stool of Power let flattery fawn, Let Faction her idols extol to the skies; To virtue in humble resentment withdrawn, Unblam'd may the merits of gratitude rise. And shall not His memory to Britain be dear, Whose example with envy all nations behold; A Statesman unbiass'd by int'rest or fear, By pow'r uncorrupted, untainted by gold? Who, when terror and doubt thro' the universe reign'd, While rapine and treason their standards unfurl'd, The heart and the hopes of his Country maintain'd, And one kingdom preserv'd 'midst the wreck of the world. Unheeding, unthankful, we bask in the blaze, While the beams of the sun in full majesty shine; When he sinks into twilight, with fondness we gaze, And mark the mild lustre that gilds his decline. Lo! Pitt, when the course of thy greatness is o'er, Thy talents, thy virtues, we fondly recall! Now justly we prize thee, when lost we deplore; Admir'd in thy zenith, but lov'd in thy fall! O! take, then—for dangers by wisdom repell'd, For evils, by courage and constancy brav'd— O take! for a throne by thy counsels upheld, The thanks of a people thy firmness has sav'd! And O! if again the rude whirlwind should rise! The dawning of Peace should fresh darkness deform, The regrets of the good, and the fears of the wise, Shall turn to the Pilot that weather'd the storm! THE GRAND CONSULTATION. “Ambubaiarum Collegia Pharmacopeiæ.” —Horace. If the health and the strength, and the pure vital breath Of old England, at last must be doctor'd to death, Oh! why must we die of one doctor alone? And why must that doctor be just such a one As Doctor Henry Addington? Oh! where is the great Doctor Dominicetti, With his stews and his flues, and his vapours to sweat ye? O! where is that Prince of all Mountebank fame, With his baths of hot earth, and his beds of hot name. Oh! where is Doctor Graham? Where are Sonmambule Mesmer's convulsions magnetic? Where is Myersbach, renown'd for his skills diuretic Where is Perkins, with tractors of magical skill? Where's the anodyne necklace of Basil Burchell? Oh! where is the great Van Butchell? Where's Sangrado Rush, so notorious for bleedings; Where's Rumford, so famed for his writings and readings; Where's that Count of the Kettle, that friend to the belly, So renown'd for transforming old bones into jelly— Where, too, is the great Doctor Kelly? While Sam Solomon's lotion the public absterges, He gives them his gold Vide in daily papers, Doctor Solomon's Charitable Subscriptions and Abstergent Lotion. as well as his purges; But our frugal doctor this practice to shun, Gives his pills to the public, the Pells to his Son Oh! fie! fie! Doctor Addington! Oh! where is Doctor Solomon? Where are all the great Doctors?

Then for Hobart and Sullivan, Hawkey and Hervey, For Wallace and Castlereagh, Bleeke and Glenbervie, For Sergeant, Vansittart, Monkhouse, and Lee, Gives us Velno and Anderson, Locke, Spilsbury, Doctor Ball, Doctors Brodum and Bree. And instead of the jack-pudding bluster of Sherry, With his “dagger of lath,” and his speeches so merry! See M. Gilray's admirable Caricature, entitled, “Dramatic Loyalty; or the Patriotic Courage of Sherry Andrew.” Let us bring to the field—every foe to appal— Aldini's galvanic deceptions—and all The slight of hand tricks of Conjuror Val. So shall Golding and Bond, the Doctor's tall yeomen, Dame Hiley, Dame Bragge, and the other old Women, For new mountebanks changed, their old tricks bid farewell to, And to the famed D'Ivernois his arithmetic sell to, That wonderful wonder, the great Katterfelto! So shall England, escaped from her “safe politicians,” Such an army array of her quacks and physicians, Such lotions and potions, pills, lancets, and leeches, That Massena shall tremble our coasts when he reaches, And the Consul himself—his breeches. ODE TO THE “DOCTOR.” How blest, how firm the Statesman stands, (Him no low intrigue shall move), Circled by faithful kindred bands, And propp'd by fond fraternal love. When his speeches hobble vilely, What! “Hear him” burst from brother Hiley, When the faltering periods lag, Hark to the cheers of brother Bragge. When the faltering periods lag, Or his yawning audience flag, When his speeches hobble vilely, Or the House receives him drily, Cheer, O! cheer him brother Bragge! Cheer, O! cheer him brother Hiley! Each a gentleman at large, Lodg'd and fed at public charge. Paying (with a grace to charm ye) This the fleet, and that the army. Brother Bragge and brother Hiley, Cheer him! when he speaks so vilely, Cheer him! when his audience flag, Brother Hiley, brother Bragge. MODERATE MEN AND MODERATE MEASURES. Praise to placeless proud ability, Let the prudent muse disclaim; And sing the Statesman—all civility— Whom moderate talents raise to fame. He, no random projects urging, Make us wild alarms to feel; With moderate measures, gently purging Ills that prey on Britain's weal. CHORUS. Gently purging, Gently purging, Gently purging Britain's weal. “Ere human statute purged the general weal.” Shakspeare. Addington, with measured motion, Keep the tenor of thy way; To glory yield no rash devotion, Led by luring lights astray; Splendid talents are deceiving; Tend to councils much too bold; Moderate men we prize, believing, All that glitters is not gold. GRAND CHORUS. All that Glisters, All that Glisters, All that Glisters is not gold! “Nor all that glisters gold.” —Gray. THE TRAITOR'S EPITAPH. (Written about the time of Colonel Despard's Execution.) May this dreary abode be for ever unknown, For ever, by virtue, by Pity, untrod; Unbreathed be his name, and unhonor'd his stone; The foe of his country, his monarch, his God. BLUE AND BUFF. Come, sportive Muse, with plume satiric, Describe each lawless, bold empiric, Who, with the Blue and Buffs' sad crew, Now stripp'd in buff, shall look so blue. First paint L?d H?w?k, boisterous, rough, Dealer in wholesale quack'ry stuff, Who, far beyond famed Katterfelt, Prescribed what ne'er was seen or felt; Left Law and Reason in the lurch, To mould the Senate, twist the Church: But wand'ring once from Downing street, Great Buckingham's old dome to greet, With grand Catholiconian pill, Was lost—on Constitution-hill. Next W?dh?m, metaphysic elf, Who all things knows—except himself; Three tedious hours who raves and talks Of all that in his cranium stalks; Whose regular ideas fear Militia much, more Volunteer, A wild inapplicable genius, Scarce versed in policy's quæ genus; In syntax yet more scantly read, Without one concord in his head. Now, Muse, direct the shaft of wit, Where little P?tty apes great Pitt; This year in woe-begone oration, To Britons paints a bankrupt nation: Resources all dilapidate, Taxation at extremest fate; Whilst next this little, great, small man, Heigh! presto! pass! by one bold plan, Restores you all to peace and plenty; The deuce is in't! won't this content ye? With necromantic rod of Moses (A twig cut from a bush of roses), To ease at once your ev'ry fear, Turns bear to bull, and bull to bear. Nor miss, dear Muse, to gild my tale, The gallant E?rl of L?d?e, Who late to Paris post was sent, to Become the dupe of Benevento; Hush'd to soft sleep like “Baby Bunting,” Whilst Fap the Great went out “a-hunting.” Or was it, say, thou bonny chiel, Thy ardent love for Britain's weal, That led thy steps, a peep to take At thy great territorial It is desired that this may not be mistaken for a sapling from the Constitutional hedge, as it is evident, that both the fence, and the land it encloses, must have been quite out of sight when the Noble Lord made his purchase. stake; The purchase of thine assignats, Thy Corso-Gallican contrats: At once th' opprobrium and solution, Of all thy love for revolution. The Muse recoils, as something shock'd her, To charge with harm the harmless D?ct?r; When, una voce, all allow, He would do right—if he knew how. But if, amongst this motely crew One man of real parts we view: With mind for highest station fit; The colleague, friend, yet foe of Pitt; He, to whose merits all men granted, That Pitt's last list, one great name wanted; He, who with every talent shone, Except consistency alone; “We smile, if such a man there be, “But weep, if Grenville should be he.” THE NEW-OLD OPPOSITION. It is said, the Great Men, who are sezied with the pouts, At their suddenly alter'd condition; Who so late were the Ins, and so soon were the Outs, Have decreed a severe Opposition. Nor will it be wonder'd at, greatly, if those Who're deprived of unmerited treasures, As of old, should determine the Men to oppose, Though their consciences sanction the Measures. Such threats are, by Britons, too well understood To create any just apprehensions; Nor can they, who, in power, accomplish no good, Now appal us by evil intentions. EPIGRAM. THE RIVALS. On the Publications of the Microcosm, a periodical paper by the Students of Eton College, about the year 1790, a similar work was brought out by the Gentlemen of Harrow on the Hill. The latter was adorned with a Frontispiece, representing the two publications suspended in a balance, the former of which is made to “kick the beam.” This invidious allegory occasioned the following Epigram. What mean ye by this print so rare? Ye wits, of Eton jealous: Behold! your rivals soar in air, And ye are heavy-fellows! ALL THE TALENTS. When the broad-bottom'd Junto, with reason at strife, Resign'd, with a sigh, its political life; When converted to Rome, and of honesty tired, They gave back to the Devil the soul he inspired. The Demon of Faction, that over them hung, In accents of horror their epitaph sung; While Pride and Venality join'd in the stave, And canting Democracy wept at the grave. “Here lies in the tomb that we hollow'd for Pitt, “Consistence of Grenville, of Temple the wit; “Of Sidmouth the firmness, the temper of Grey, “And Treasurer Sheridan's promise to pay. “Here Petty's finance, from the evils to come, “With Fitzpatrick's sobriety creeps to the tomb; “And Chancellor Ego, now left in the lurch, “Neither dines with the Jordan, nor whines for the church. “Then huzza for the Party that here is at rest, “By the fools of a faction regretted and blest; “Though they sleep with the Devil, yet theirs is the “hope, “On the downfall of Britain to rise with the Pope.” ELIJAH'S MANTLE, A TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM PITT. I When, by th' Almighty's dread command Elijah, call'd from Israel's land, Rose in the sacred flame, His Mantle good Elisha caught, And, with the Prophet's spirit fraught, Her second hope became. II In Pitt our Israel saw combined The Patriot's heart—the Prophet's mind, Elijah's spirit here: Now, sad reverse!—that spirit reft, No confidence, no hope is left; For no Elijah's near. III Is there, among the greedy band Who've seized on power, with harpy hand, And Patriot, worth assume, One on whom public faith can rest— One fit to wear Elijah's vest, And cheer a Nation's gloom? IV Grenville!—to aid thy Treasury fame, A portion of Pitt's Mantle claim, His gen'rous ardour feel; Resolve, 'bove sordid self, to soar, Amidst Exchequer gold be poor! Thy wealth—the public weal. V Fox!—if on thee some remnant fall, The shred may to thy mind recal, Those hours of loud debate, When thy unhallow'd lips be-praised “The glorious fabric” traitors raised An Bourbon's fallen state. VI Thy soul let Pitt's example fire, With patriot zeal thy tongue inspire, Spite of thy Gallic leaven; And teach thee in thy latest day, His form of prayer, (if thou canst pray) “O save my country, Heaven! VII Windham,—if e'er thy sorrows flow For private loss or public woe, Thy rigid bow unbend: Tears over Cæsar Brutus shed, His hatred warr'd not with the dead— And Pitt was once thy friend. VIII Does Envy bid thee not to mourn? Hold then his Mantle up to scorn, His well-earn'd fame assail: Of funeral honors stript his corse, And at his virtues till thou'rt hoarse, Like curst Thersites rail! IX Illustrious Roscius of the State! New-breech'd and harness'd for debate, Thou wonder of thy age! Petty or Betty art thou height, By Granta sent to strut thy night On Stephen's bustling stage. X Pitt's 'Chequer robe 'tis thine to wear; Take of his Mantle too a share, 'Twill aid thy Ways and Means; And should Fat Jack, and his Cabal; Cry “Rob us the Exchequer, Hal!” 'Twill charm away the fiends. XI Sage Palinurus of the realm! By Vincent call'd to take the helm! And play his proxy's part; Dost thou or star or compass know? Canst reef aloft—or hand below? Past conn'd the shipman's chart? XII No!—From Pitt's Mantle tear a rag, Enough to serve thee for a flag, And hoist it on thy mast: Beneath that sign (our prosperous star) Shall future Nelsons rush to war, And rival victories past. XIII Sidmouth—though low his head is laid Who call'd thee from thy native shade, An gave thee second birth; Gave thee the sweets of Power and Place, The tufted gown—the gilded mace, And rear'd thy puny worth: XIV Think how his Mantle wrapp'd thee round: Is one of equal virtue found Among thy new compeers? Or can thy cloak of Amiens stuff, Once laugh'd to scorn by Blue and Buff, Screen thee from Windham's jeers? XV When Faction threaten'd Britain's land Thy new-made friends—a desperate band, Like Ahab—stood reproved: Pitt's powerful tongue their rage could check; His counsel saved, 'midst General wreck, The Israel that he loved. XVI Yes, honor'd shade! whilst near thy grave The letter'd sage, and chieftain brave, The votive marble claim; O'er thy cold corse—the public tear Congeal'd, a crystal shrine shall rear, Unsullied as thy fame! PARODY. INSCRIPTION For the door of the cell in newgate, where Mrs. Brownrigg, the prentice-cide, was confined previous to her execution. [For one long term, or e'er her trial came] For one long term, or e'er her trial came, Here Brownrigg linger'd. Often have these cells Echoed her blasphemies, as with shrill voice She scream'd for fresh Geneva. Not to her Did the blithe fields of Tothill, or thy street St. Giles, its fair varieties expand; Till at the last in slow drawn cart she went To execution. Dost thou ask her crime? She whipp'd two female 'prentices to death, And hid them in the coal-hole. For her mind Shap'd strictest plans of discipline. Sage schemes! Such as Lycurgus taught, when at the shrine Of the Orthyan Goddess he bade flog The little Spartans; such as erst chastised Our Milton when at College. For this act Did Brownrigg swing. Harsh laws; but time shall come, When France shall reign, and laws be all repeal'd! EPITAPH. GEORGE CHARLES CANNING, Eldest Son of The Right Honourable GEORGE CANNING, and JOAN SCOTT his Wife; Born April 25, 1801—Died March 31, 1820. [Though short thy span, God's unimpeach'd decrees] Though short thy span, God's unimpeach'd decrees, Which made that shorten'd span one long disease, Yet merciful in chastening, gave thee scope For mild, redeeming virtues, Faith and Hope; Meek Resigination; pious Charity And, since this world was not the world for thee, Far from thy path removed, with partial care, Strife, Glory, Gain, and Pleasure's flowery snare, Bade Earth's temptations pass thee harmless by, And fix'd on Heaven thine unadverted eye! Oh! mark'd from birth, and nurtur'd for the skies! In youth, with more than learning's wisdom, wise! As sainted martyrs, patient to endure! Simple as unweari'd infancy and pure! Pure from all stain (save that of human clay, Which Christ's atoning blood hath wash'd away!) By mortal sufferings now no more oppress'd, Mount sinless Spirit, to thy destined rest! While I—reversed our nature's kindlier doom Pour forth a father's sorrows on thy tomb. FINIS.</field>
