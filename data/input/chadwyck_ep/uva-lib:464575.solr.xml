      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I.Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. I. SATIRES. 1593–1602. SATIRE VI. TO S? NICHOLAS SMYTH. Sleep, next Society and true friendship, Man's best contentment, doth securely slip His passions, and the world's troubles; rock me, O sleep, wean'd from my dear friend's company, In a cradle free from dreams or thoughts, there Where poor men ly, for Kings asleep do fear. Here sleep, and howsed by famous Ariosto, By silver-tongu'd Ovid, and many moe, Perhaps by gold-mouth'd Spencer too pardie (Which builded was two dozen Stories high), I had repair'd, but that it was so rotten, As sleep awak'd by Ratts from them was gotten: And I will build no new, for by my Will, Thy father's house shall be the fairest still In Excester. Yet, methinks, for all their Wit, Those wits that say nothing, best describe it. Without it there is no Sense, only in this Sleep is unlike a long Parenthesis. Not to save charges, but would I had slept The time I spent in London, when I kept Fighting and untrust gallants Company, In which Natta, the new Knight, seized on me, And offered me the experience he had bought With great Expence. I found him throughly taught In curing Burnes. His thing had had more scars Then T? himself; like Epps it often wars, And still is hurt. For his Body and State The Physick and Councel (which came too late 'Gainst Whores and Dice) he now on me bestows: Most superficially he speaks of those. I found by him, least sound him who most knows. He swears well, speakes ill, but best of Clothes, What fits Summer, what Winter, what the Spring He had Living, but now these waies comein[ge] His whole Revenew; Where his Whore now dwells, And hath dwelt since his father's death, he tells. Yea he tells most cunningly each hid cause Why Whores forsake their Bawds: To these, some Laws He knows of the Duel, and touch his Skill The least Jot in that or these, he quarrel will Though sober, but he 'as never fought. I know What made his Valour undubd Windmill go Within a Pint at most! yet for all this (Which is most strange) Natta thinks no man is More honest than himself. Thus men may want Conscience, whilst being brought up ignorant, They use themselves to vice. And besides those Illiberal Arts forenam'd, no Vicar knows, Nor other Captain less then he; His Schools Are Ordinaries, where civil men seem fools, Or are for being there; His best bookes, Plaies, Where, meeting godly Scenes, perhaps he praies. His first set prayer was for his father ill And sick,—that he might dye: That had, until The Lands were gone, he troubled God no more: And then ask'd him but his Right, That the whore Whom he had kept, might now keep him: She, spent, They left each other on even terms; she went To Bridewel, he unto the Wars, where want Hath made him valiant, and a Lieutenant He is become: Where, as they pass apace, He steps aside, and for his Captain's place He praies again: Tells God, he will confess His sins, swear, drink, dice, and whore thenceforth less, On this Condition, that his Captain dye And he succeed; But his Prayer did not; they Both cashir'd came home, and he is braver now Than his captain: all men wonder, few know how: Can he rob? No. Cheat? No. Or doth he spend His own? No. Fidus, he is thy dear friend, That keeps him up. I would thou wert thine own, Or hadst as good a friend as thou art one. No present Want nor future hope made me, Desire (as once I did) thy friend to be: But he had cruelly possest thee then, And as our Neighbours the Low-Country men, Being (whilst they were Loyal, with Tyranny Opprest) broke loose, have since refus'd to be Subject to good Kings, I found even so, Wert thou well rid of him, thou't have no moe. Could'st thou but chuse as well as love, to none Thou should'st be second: Turtle and Damon Should give thee place in songs, and Lovers sick Should make thee only Love's Hieroglyphick: Thy Impress should be the loving Elm and Vine, Where now an ancient Oak with Ivy twine, Destroy'd, thy Symbole is. O dire Mischance! And, O vile verse! And yet our Abraham France Writes thus, and jests not. Good Fidus for this Must pardon me, Satyre's Bite when they kiss. But as for Natta, we have since faln out: Here on his knees, he pray'd, else we had fought. And because God would not he should be winner, Nor yet would have the Death of such a sinner, At his seeking, our Quarrel is deferr'd, I'l leave him at his Prayers, and as I heard, His last: and, Fidus, you and I do know, I was his friend, and durst have been his foe, And would be either yet; But he dares be Neither: Sleep blots him out and takes in thee. ‘The mind, you know, is like a Table-book, The old, unwipt, new writing never took.’ Hear how the Huishers, Checques, Cupbord, and Fire I pass'd: (by which Degrees young men aspire In Court): And how that idle and she-state (When as my judgment cleer'd) my soul did hate, How I found there (if that my trifling Pen Durst take so hard a Task) Kings were but men, And by their Place more noted, if they erre; How they and their Lords unworthy men prefer; And, as unthrifts, had rather give away Great Summs to flatterers, than small debts pay; So they their greatness hide, and greatness show By giving them that which to worth they owe: What Treason is, and what did Essex kill, Not true Treason, but Treason handled ill: And which of them stood for their Countrie's good, Or what might be the Cause of so much Blood; He said she stunck, and men might not have said That she was old before that she was dead. His Case was hard, to do or suffer; loth To do, he made it harder, and did both. Too much preparing lost them all their Lives, Like some in Plagues kill'd with preservatives. Friends, like land-souldiers in a storm at Sea, Not knowing what to do, for him did pray. They told it all the world: where was their wit? Cuff's putting on a sword, might have told it. And Princes must fear Favorites more then Foes, For still beyond Revenge Ambition goes. How since Her death, with Sumpter-horse that Scot Hath rid, who, at his coming up, had not A Sumpter-dog. But till that I can write Things worth thy Tenth reading (dear Nick) good night. III. ELEGIES. XIII. LOVE-MEMORIES IN ABSENCE. Come, Fates! I feare you not. All, whome I owe, Are paide but you. Then 'rest mee e're I goe. But Chance from yow all soueraignty hath gott, Loue woundeth none but those whome Death dares not: Else if you were, and just in equity, I should haue vanquisht her, as you did mee. Else louers should not braue Death's pains, and liue: But 'tis a rule, Death comes not to relieue. For pale and wann Death's terrors, are they laide Soe deep in louers, they make Death affraide? Or, (the least comfort) haue I companny? Orecame she Fates, Loue, Death, as well as mee? Yes, Fates doe silke unto her distaffe pay For ransome, which tax they on us do lay. Love giues her youth, which is the reason why Youths, for her sake, some wither and some dye. Poore Death can nothing giue; yet for her sake, Still in her turne, he doth a louer take. And if Death should proue fals, she fears him nott, For our Muse, to redeeme her, she hath got. That last and fatal night wee kist, I thus praide, (Or rather thus despair'd, I should haue saide.) Kisses, and yet despaire! The forbidden tree Did promiss (and deceaue) no more then she. Like lambs that see their teats, yet must eat hay, A food, whose tast hath made me pine away: Diues, when thou sawst bliss, and crauest to touch A drop of water, then thy great pains were such. Heere greif wants a fresh wit, for mine being spent, And my sighes weary, grones are all my rent; Unable longer to endure the paine, They breake like thunder, and doe bring downe raine. Thus, till drye tears soder mine eyes, I weepe: And then I dreame, how you securly sleepe, And in your dreams doe laugh at me. I hate, And pray Loue, all may: He pittyes my estate, But sayes, I therin no reuenge shall find; The sun would shine, though all the world were blind, Yet, to try my hate, Loue shew'd mee your teare; And I had dyde, had not your smile been there. Your froune undoes mee; your smile is my wealth; And as you pleas to looke, I haue my health. Methought Loue, pittying mee, when he saw this, Gaue me your hands, the backs and palmes, to kiss. That cur'd me not, but to beare pain gaue strength; And what it lost in force, it took in length. I call'd on Loue againe, who fear'd you soe, That his compassion still prou'd greater woe: For then I dream'd I was in bedd with you, But durst not feele, for fear 't should not proue true. This merritts not your angar, had it been; The Queen of Chastity was naked seene: And in bed, not to feele, the paine I tooke, Was much more then for Actæon not to looke. And that breast, which lay ope, I did not knowe But for the clernes, from a lump of snowe: Nor that sweet teat which on the top it bore From the rose-bud which for my sake you wore. These griefs to issue forth, by verse I proue, Or turne their course by trauell or new loue. All would not do, the best at last I tryde, Unable longer to hold out I dyide. And then I found I lost lif's death by flying; Where hundreds liue, are but so long in dying. Charon did lett me pass; I him requite To walke the groues or shade, wronging my delight: Ile speak out of those ghosts I found alone, Those thousand ghosts, wherof my self made one, All images of thee: I askt them whie; The Iudge told mee, they all for thee did dye, And therefore had for their Elizian bliss Another, their owne loues to kisse. O here I myst, not blisse, but being dead (For loe I dreampt) I dreamt, and waking sed, Heauen if whoe are in thee ther must dwell, How is't I now was there, and now I fell? XVIII. LOVE'S PROGRESS. Whoever loves, if he doth not propose The right true end of loue, hee's one that goes To sea for nothinge but to make him sicke: Love is a beare-whelpe borne, if we ore-licke Our loue, and force it newe strange shapes to take, We erre, and of a lump a monster make. Were not a calf a monster, that were grown Faced like a man, though better than his own? Perfection is in vnity: preferr One woman first, and then one thing in her. I, when I valew gold, may thinke uponn The ductilness, the applicatyon, The wholsomenes, the ingenuetye, From rust, from soile, from fire for ever free: But if I loue it, 'tis because 'tis made (By our new nature) use, the sowl of trade. All this in woman we might think upon (If women had them), and yet loue but one. Can men more iniure women then to say They love them for that, by which they're not they? Makes virtue woman? must I coole my blood Till I both be, and fynd one, wise and good? Let barren angels loue soe, but if wee Make love to woman, virtue is not shee, As bewtie's not, nor wealth; he that strais thus, From her to her's, is more adulterous Then if he tooke her mayd. Serch every sphære And firmament, our Cupid is not there: He's an infernall god, and undergrownd, With Pluto dwells, where gold and fyre abound; Men to such gods their sacrifizing coles Did not on altars lay, but in pytts and holes: Although we see cælestiall bodyes move Above the earth, the earth we tyll and loue: So we her aires contemplate, words, and hart, And virtues; but we love the centrique part. Nor is the sowle more worthy, or more fytt For love, then this, as infinyte as it. But in attayning this desirèd place How much they err, that set out at the face! The hayre a forrest is of ambushes, Of springges, snares, fetters, and manacles: The browe becalms us, when 'tis smooth and plaine; And when 'tis wrinkled, shipwracks us againe. Smooth, 'tis a paradice, where we wold haue Immortal stay; but wrinkled, 'tis our grave. The nose (like to the first meridian) runns Not betwixt east and west, but 'twixt two sunns; It leaves a cheeke, a rosie hemispheare On eyther syde, and then directs us where Upon the islands Fortunate wee fall, Not faint Canaries, but ambrosiall And swelling lipps to which when we are come, We anchor there, and thinke ourselves at home, For they seeme all: there syrens' songes, and there Wise Delphique oracles, doe fill the eare; There in a creeke, where chosen pearls do swell, The Remora, her cleaving toungue, doth dwell. These and the glorious promontory, her chynn, Being past, the straits of Helespont, between The Sestos and Abidos of her brests, (Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests) Succeeds a bowndless sea, but yet thyne eye Some island moles may scattred there discry, And sayling towards her India, in the way Shall at her faire Atlantique navill stay, Though thence the current be thy pylot made, Yet ere thou be where thou would'st be embaide, Thou shalt vpon another forrest sett, Where many shipwrack and no further gett. When thou art there, consider thou thy chace Maskt longer by beginninge at the face. Rather sett out belowe; practize my art; Some simmetrie the foot hath with that part, Which thou dost seek, and is as mapp for that; Lovely enough to stopp, but not stay att: Least subject to disguise and change it is; Men say the Devil never can change his. It is the embleme, that hath figurèd Firmnes; 'tis the first part that comes to bedd. Civilitie we see refyned: the kisse (Which at the face begun) transplanted is, Since to the hand, since to the imperiall knee, Now at the Papall foote delights to bee: If kings thinke that the nearer way, and doe Rise from the foot, lovers may doe so too. For as free sphæres move faster farr then can Byrds, whom the ayre resists; so may that man, Which goes this emptie and ethireall way, Then if at bewtie's enemies he stay. Rich Nature hath in woman wisely made Two purses, and their mowths aversly laid: Then they, which to the lower tribute owe, That way, which that exchequor looks, must goe: He who doth not, his error is as great, As who by clyster gives the stomack meate. XIX. TO HIS MISTRESS GOING TO BED. Come, Madam, come, all rest my powres defie, Untill I labour, I in labour lye. The foe ofttymes, havinge the foe in sight, Is tir'd with standinge, though he never fight. Off with that gyrdle, like heavn's zone glysteringe, But a farr fayrer world incompassinge. Unpin that spangled brestplate, which you weare, That the 'eyes of busy fools might be stopt there; Unlace yourselfe, for that (your woman's chyme) Tells me from you, that now 'tis your bedtime. Off with that happy busk, which I envye, That still can bee, and still can stand so nigh. Your gowne goeing off such bewteous state reveales, As when from flowry meads th'hill's shadowe steals. Off with your wirie coronett, and showe The hairye diadems which on you doe growe: Off with your hose and shooes, then safely tread In this Love's hallow'd temple, this soft bedd. In such white robes heaven's angels use to bee Perceiv'd by men; thou angell bring'st with thee A heaven-like Mahomet's paradice; and though Ill spirits walke in whyte, we easily know By this, these angels from an evill sprite; Those sett our hayre, but these our flesh upright. License my roaving hands, and let them goe Behynd, before, betweene, above, belowe. Oh my America! my Newfoundland! My kingdom, safest when with one man man'd. My myne of precious stones! my emperie! How blest am I, in thus discoveringe thee! To enter in those bonds is to be free; That where my hand is sett my seale shalbee. Full nakednes! all joyes are due to thee; As fowles unbodyed boydes uncloth'd must bee, To tast whole joyes. Gems, which you women use, Are, as Atlanta's balls, cast in men's viewes; That when a foole's eye lighteth on a gemm, His earthly sowle might covrt those, not them: Like pictures or like books' gay coverings made For lay-men, are all women thus arraide. Themselves are only mistique books, which wee (Whome their imputed grace will dignifie) Must see revail'd. Then since that I may know, As liberally as to a midwife showe Thyselfe; cast all, yea y? white lynen hence; There is no penance due to inocence. To teach thee, I'le be naked first; why, than What needs thou haue more covering then a man? XX. OPINION. The heavens rejoice in motion; why should I Abjure my so beloued varyety, And not with many, youth and loue deuide? Pleasure is none, if not diversifide. The sun, that sitting in the chaire of light, Sheds flame into what else soe'er seemes bright, Is not contented att one Sign to inn, But ends his yeare, and att a new begins. All things doe willingly in chang delight, The fruitfull mother of our appetite: Riuers the clerer and more pleasing are, Wheere their faire-spreading streams run wide and clear; And a dead lake, that no strange barque doth greete, Corrupts itself and what doth liue in itt. Let no man tell me such a one is faire And worthy all alone my loue to sheire. Nature hath done in her the liberall part Of a kind mistress, and emploide her art To make her loueable; and I auerr Him not humane, that would return from her; I loue her well; and could, if need weer, dye To doe her seruice. But followes itt that I Must serue her only, when I may haue choice? The lawe is hard, and shall not haue my voice. The last I saw in all extreames is faire, And houlds me in the sunnbeams of her haire; Her nymphlike features such agreements haue, That I could venture with her to the graue: Another's broune, I like her not the worse; Her toungue is soft, and takes me with discourse; Others, for that they well descended are, Doe in my loue obteine as larg a share; And though they be not faire, 'tis much with me To winn their loue only for their degree; And though I faile of my requirèd ends, The attempt is glorious, and ittself comends. How happy weer our sires in ancient time, Who held plurality of loues no crime! With them it was accounted charrety To stirr up race of all indifferently; Kindred were not exempted from the bands, Which with the Persians still in usage stands. Women were then no sooner askt then won; And what they did was honest, and well done. But since this title honnour hath been used, Ower weake credulety hath been abusde; The goulden lawes of nature are repeald, Which our first fathers in such reuerence held; Our libertye's reverst, and chartar's gone, And we made servants to Opinion; A monster in no certeine shape attird, And whose originall is much desired; Formless at first, butt growing on, itt fashions, And doth prescribe manners and laws to nations. Here Loue received immedicinable harmes, And was despoilèd of his daring armes; A greater want then is his dareing eyes, He lost those awfull wings with which he flyes; His sinewy bow, and those imortal darts, Wherewith hee's wont to bruise resisting harts. Only some few, strong in themselues, and free, Retaine the seeds of ancient liberty; Following that part of loue, although deprest, And make a throne for him within their brest; In spite of modern censures, him avouing Their soveraigne, all seruice him allowing. Amongst which troope, although I am the least, Yet equall in affections with the best, I glory in subjection of his hand, Nor neuer did decline his least comaund; For in whateuer form the message came, My heart did open, and receaue the flame. But time will in its course a point descrye, When I this lovèd seruice must denye; For our allegience temporary is; With firmer age returne ower libertyes. What time, in grauer judgement, wee repos'd, Shall not soe easily be to change disposed; Nor to the art of several eyes obeying, But beauty with true worth soe rarely weying; Which being found assembled in some one, Wee'll loue her euer, and loue her alone. XXI. A PARADOX OF A PAINTED FACE. Not kisse! by Jouve I must, and make impression! As longe as Cupid dares to hould his scessyoun Within my flesh and blood, our kisses shall Out-minvte tyme, and without number fall. Doe I not know these balls of blushinge redd That on thy cheeks thus amorously are spread, Thy snowie necke, those vaines vpon thy browe Which with their azure twinklinge sweetly bowe, Are artificiall, borrowed, and no more thyne owne Then chaynes which on St. George's day are showne Are propper to their wearers; yet for this I idole thee, and begge a luschyous kisse. The fucus and ceruse, which on thy face Thy cuninge hand layes on to add new grace, Deceive me with such pleasinge fraud, that I Fynd in thy art, what can in Nature lye. Much like a paynter that vpon some wall On which the cadent sun-beames vse to fall Paynts with such art a guylded butterflie That sillie maids with slowe-mov'd fingers trie To catch it, and then blush at their mistake, Yet of this painted flie most reckoninge make: Such is our state, since what we looke vpon Is nought but colour and proportionn. Take we a face as full of frawde and lyes As gipsies in your common lottereyes, That is more false and more sophisticate Then are saints' reliques, or a man of state; Yet such beinge glosèd by the sleight of arte Gaine admiration, wininge many a hart. Put case there be a difference in the mold, Yet may thy Venus be more choice, and hold A dearer treasure. Oftentimes we see Rich Candyan wynes in wooden bowles to bee; The oderiferous civett doth not lye Within the pretious muscatt's eare or eye, But in a baser place; for prudent Nature In drawinge us of various formes and feature, Gives from y? envious shopp of her large treasure To faire partes comlynesse, to baser pleasure. The fairest flowres that in y? Springe do grow Are not soe much for vse, as for the showe; As lyllies, hyacinths, and your gorgious byrth Of all pied-flowers, which dyaper the Earth, Please more with their discoulered purple traine Then holsome pot-hearbs which for vse remayne. Shall I a gawdie-speckled serpent kisse For that the colours which he wears be his? A perfum'd cordevant who will not weare Because y? sent is borrowed otherwhere? The robes and vestments which do grace vs all Are not our owne, but adventitiall. Tyme rifles Nature's bewtie, but slie Art Repaires by cuninge this decayinge part; Fills here a wrinckle and there purls a vayne, And with a nymble hand runs ore againe The breaches dented in by th'arme of Tyme, And makes deformitie to be noe cryme; As when great men be grypt by sicknes' hand Industrious phisick pregnantly doth stand To patch vp fowle diseases, and doth strive To keepe their totteringe carcasses alive. Bewtie's a candle-light, which euery puffe Blowes out, and leaves naught but a stinking snuff To fill our nostrills with. This boldly thinke, The clearest candle makes y? greatest stinke; As your pure food and cleanest nutriment Getts the most hott and most strong excrement. Why hang we then on things so apt to varye, So fleetinge, brittle, and so temporarie, That agues, coughs, the tooth-ake, or catharr (Slight howses of diseases) spoyle and marr? But when old age their bewty hath in chace, And ploughes vpp furrowes in their once smooth face, Then they become forsaken, and doe shewe Like stately abbies ruyn'd longe agoe. Nature but gives the modell and first draught Of faire perfection, which by Art is taught To make itselfe a compleat forme and birth Soe, stands a coppie to these shapes on Earth. Jove grant me then a repairable face, Which whil'st that coulors are, can want noe grace; Pigmalion's painted statue I wold loue, Soe it were warme or soft, or could but move. XXII. LOVE'S WAR. Till I have peace with thee, warr other men; And when I haue peace, can I leave thee then? All other warrs are scrupelous, only thou A faire free cyttie, maist thy selfe allowe To any one. In Flanders, who can tell Whether the master 'press, or men rebell? Onely we knowe, that which all ideots say, They beare most blowes that come to part the fray. France in her lunatique giddines did hate Even our men, yea and our God of late; Yet she relies vpon our angells well, Which n'ere returne no more then they that fell. Sicke Ireland is with a strange warr possesst, Like to an ague, now raging, now at rest, Which tyme will cure: yet it must doe her good If she were purg'd, and her head-vaine let blood. And Midas joyes, our Spanish jorneys give, We touche all gold, but fynd no food to live. And I shold be in the hot parchinge clyme To dust and ashes turnd before my tyme. To mewe me in a shipp is to inthrall Me in a prisonn, that were like to fall; Or in a cloister, save that there men dwell In a calme Heav'n, here in a swayring Hell. Long voiages are long consumptions, And shipps are carts for executyons; Yea, they are deaths: It is all one to flye Into another world, as 'tis to die. Heere let me warre, in these arms let me lye; Here let me parley: better bleed then dye. Thyne arms imprison mee, and myn arms thee; Thy hart thy ransom is, take myne for mee. Other men warr, that thay their rest may gaine, But we will rest that we may fight againe. Those warrs th'ignorant, these the experienct love; There we are alwais vnder, heere aboue; There engines farr of[f] breed a iust true feare; Neere thrusts, pickes, stabbs, yea bullets, hurt not heere. There lyes are wronges, here safe vprightly lye; There men kill men, wee'le make one by and by. Thou nothinge, I not halfe soe much to doe In these warrs, as they may which from vs two Shall springe. Thowsands we see which travail not To warr, but stay, swords, arms, and shott To make at home; and shall not I do then More gloriovs service, staying to make men? XXIII. LOVE'S POWER. Shall Love, that gave Latona's heire the foile, (Proud of his archerie and Pethon's spoile,) And so enthral'd him to a nimph's disdaine As, when his hopes were dead, hee, full of paine, Made him above all trees the lawrell grace, An embleme of Loue's glory, his disgrace; Shall he, I say, be termed a foot-boy now Which made all powers in Heauen and Earth to bowe? Or is't a fancy which themselves doe frame, And therefore dare baptize by any name? A flaming straw! which one sparke kindles bright, And first hard breath out of itselfe doth fright; Whose father was a smile, and death a frowne, Soon proud of little and for lesse cast downe? 'Tis so! and this a lackie terme you may, For it runs oft, and makes but shortest stay. But thou, O Love! free from Time's eating rust, That sett'st a limite unto boundles lust, Making desire grow infinitely stronge, And yett to one chast subiect still belong; Bridling self-love, that flatters us in ease, Quick'ning our witts to striue that they may please; Fixing the wand'ring thoughts of straying youth, The firmest bond of Faith, the knott of Truth: Thou that did'st never lodge in worthles hart, Thou art a master, whersoe're thou art. Thou mak'st food loathsome, sleep to be unrest, Lost labor easeful, scornefull lookes a feast; And when thou wilt, thy ioyes as farr excell All elce as, when thou punish'st, thy Hell. Oh make that rebell feele thy matchles power, Thou that mad'st Jove a bull, a swan, a showre. Give him a love as tirannous as faire, That his desire goe yoakèd with despaire; Live in her eyes, but in her frozen heart Lett no thaw come that may have sence of smart. Lett her a constant silence never breake, Till he doe wish repulse to heare her speake; And last, such sence of error lett him haue As he may never dare for mercy crave. Then none will more capittulate with thee, But of their harts will yield the empire free. XXIV. LOVE AND REASON. Base Love, the stain of youth, the scorn of age, The folly of a man, a woman's rage; The canker of a froward will thou art, The business of an idle, empty heart; The rack of Jealousy and sad Mistrust, The smooth and justified excuse of lust; The thief which wastes the taper of our life; The quiet name of restless jars and strife; The fly which dost corrupt and quite distaste All happiness if thou therein be cast; The greatest and the most concealed impostor That ever vain credulity did foster; A mountebank extolling trifles small, A juggler playing loose, not fast with all; An alchymist, whose promises are gold, Payment but dross, and hope at highest sold. This, this is Love, and worse than I can say When he a master is, and bears the sway. He guides like Phaeton, burns and destroys, Parches and stifles what would else be joys. But when clear Reason, sitting in the throne, Governs his beams,—which otherwise are none But darts and mischiefs,—oh, then, sunlike, he Doth actuate, produce, ripen, and free From grossness, those good seeds which in us lie Till then as in a grave, and there would die. All high perfections in a perfect lover His warmth does cherish, and his light discover. He gives an even temper of delight Without a minute's loss; nor fears affright Nor interrupt the joys such love doth bring, Nor no enjoying can dry up the spring. Unto another he lends out our pleasure, That—with the use—it may come home a treasure. Pure link of bodies where no lust controuls, The fastness and security of souls! Sweetest path of life, virtue in full sail, Tree-budding hope whose fruit doth never fail! To this dear love I do no rebel stand, Though not employed, yet ready at command. Wherefore, oh Reason high, thou who art king Of the world's king, and dost in order bring The wild affections, which so often swerve From thy just rule, and rebel passions serve; Thou without whose light love's fire is but smoke, Which puts out eyes and mind's true sense doth choak; Restore this lover to himself again, Send him a lively feeling of his pain, Give him a healthy and discerning taste Of food and rest, that he may rest at last, By strength of thee, from his strange strong disease, Wherein the danger is that it doth please. Grant this, oh Reason, at his deep'st request Who never loved to see your power supprest. And now to you, Sir Love, your love I crave, Of you no mastery I desire to have. But that we may, like honest friends, agree, Let us to Reason fellow-servants be. XXV. TO A LADY OF DARK COMPLEXION. If shadows be the picture's excellence And make it seem more lively to the sense; If stars in the bright day are lost from sight And seem most glorious in the mask of Night; Why should you think, rare creature, that you lack Perfection, cause your eyes and hair are black; Or that your heavenly beauty, which exceeds The new-sprung lilies in their maidenheads, The damask colour of your cheeks and lips Should suffer by their darkness an eclipse? Rich diamonds shine brightest being set And compassèd within a field of jet; Nor were it fit that nature should have made So bright a sun to shine without some shade— It seems that Nature, when she first did fancy Your rare composure, studied nigromancy: That when to you this gift she did impart She usèd altogether the black art, By which infusèd powers from magic book You do command, like spirits, with a look. She drew those magic circles in your eyes, And made your hair the chains with which she ties Rebelling hearts. Those blue veins, which appear Winding meanders about either sphere, Mysterious figures are; and when you list, Your voice commandeth as the exorcist. O, if in magic you have power so far, Vouchsafe to make me your familiar. Nor hath dame Nature her black art revealed To outward parts alone, some lie concealed. For as by heads of springs men often know The nature of the streams which run below, So your black hair and eyes do give direction To think the rest to be of like complexion; That rest where all rest lies that blesseth man, That Indian mine, that straight of Magelan, That world-dividing gulph, where he who ventures With swelling sails and ravisht senses, enters To a new world of bliss. Pardon I pray, If my rude Muse presumeth to display Secrets unknown, or hath her bounds o'erpast In praising sweetness which I ne'er did taste. Starved men do know there's meat, and blind men may, Though hid from light, presume there is a day. The rover, in the mark his arrow strikes Sometimes as well as he that shoots at pricks; And if that I might aim my shaft aright, The black mark I would hit and not the white. XXVI. AN ELEGIE TO MRS. BOULSTRED. Shall I goe force an elegy? abuse My witt? and breake the hymen of my Muse For one poore hower's love? deserues it such Which serues not mee to doe on her as much? Or if it would, I would that fortune shunn— Who would be rich to be soe soon vndone? The beggar's best that wealth doth never know, And but to shew it him increaseth woe. But we two may enioy an hower, when never It returns, who would have a losse for ever? Nor can soe short a loue, if true, but bring A half-hower's feare with thought of loosing. Before it all howers were hope, and all are, That shall come after it, yeares of dispaire. This ioy brings this doubt, whether it were more To haue enioyed it, or haue dy'de before. 'Tis a lost Paradize, a fall from grace, Which I think Adam felt more than his race; Nor need these angels any other Hell, It is enough for them from Heaven they fell. Beside, conquest in love is all in all, That when I list shee under me may fall; And for this turne, both for delight and view I'll haue a Succuba as good as you. But when these toyes are past, and o? blood ends, The best injoying is, wee still are freindes. Loue can but be friendship's outside, there two Beauties differ as minds and bodyes do. Thus I this good still fayne would be to take, Vnles one hower another happy make; Or that I might forgett it instantly; Or in that blest estate that I might dye. But why doe I thus trauaile in the skill Of dispos'd Poetry, and perchance spill My fortune, or undoe myself in sport By hauing but that daungerous name in Court? I'll leave, and since I doe your poet proue, Keepe you my lines as secret as my love. XXVII. LOVE AND WIT. Trew love fynds wytt, but he whose witt doth move Him to love, confesseth he doth not love; And from his wytt, passions and true desire Are forc't as hard as from the flynnt is fyre. My Love's all fyer, whose flames my sowle doth nurs, Whose smoakes are syghs, whose euery spark's a vers. Doth measure win women? Then I know the why Most of our ladyes with the Scots doe lye. A Scot is measured, in each syllable, terse And smooth as a verse, and like that smooth verse Is shallow, and wants matter cut in bands, And they're rugged. Her state better stands Whom dawncinge measures tempted, not y? Scott; In briefe their out of measure cost, so gott. Greene-sicknes wenches (not needs must, but) may Looke pale, breathe short: at Court none so long stay. Good wit never dispairèd there, or ay me sayd, For never wench at Covrt was ravishèd. And she but cheats on Heav'n whom soe you wynn, Thinkinge to share the sport, but not the synn. XXVIII. A LOVE-MONSTER. Behold a wonder such as hath not bene From Pirrhus age vnto this present seene! Six fingers, two heads, and such rarieties Which sometyme haue been thought as prodigies May passe as common things. No monster there Compar'd with this which I about me beare. Sporting with Calda as I oft before Had done with her, and many of them more, When in few dayes somthinge began t'appeare The thought whereof amazèd me with feare. I 'had thought that I 'had plundyred a sandy shore, For what's more barren then a comon whore? But now I see the signes, feele them and handle, And know, alas, I 'am in for sope and candle. But heer's the wonder, that noe Oedipus Nor sphinx can ere vnryddle without vs. The father and the mother are the same, And I the agent both and patient am. I gott the chyld and beare it, she is free, The care of being delivered lyes in mee. My belly swells and cannot be conceald, The poyson is gone too farr to be heald. All men that see me [do] faint, halt and shrinke, Wonder to see't, but know not what to think. Now is the tyme of my deliverance neare, And now I labour betwixt hope and feare. Hopinge y? best, yet euermore in doubt How this Cæsarian bratt can be cut out. A barber is my mydwife, and a knyfe That cuts the infant's throat doth give it life. One such a chance acruid to Jove, when hee Slylie on earth stole secret leacherye. When Vulcan launc't him and so drest y? sore That from that tyme he never felt it more. The chyld he Pallas call'd, because, quoth hee, Hereafter I do meane wyser to bee. So call I myne as aptly and as fytt, For I'me resolvèd, myne shal teach me wytt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. I. VERSE-LETTERS. UPON MR. THOMAS CORYAT'S CRUDITIES. Oh, to what height will love of greatness drive Thy learnèd spirit, sesqui-superlative! Venice' vast lake thou' hast seen, and wouldst seek than Some vaster thing, and foundst a courtizan; That inland sea having discover'd well, A cellar gulf, where one might sail to hell From Heydelberg, thou long'st to see: and thou This book, greater than all, producest now. Infinite work! which doth so far extend, That none can study it to any end. 'Tis no one thing; it is not fruit nor root, Nor poorly limited with head or foot. If man be therefore man, because he can Reason and laugh, thy book doth half make man. One half being made, thy modesty was such, That thou on th'other half wouldst never touch. When wilt thou be at full, great lunatique? Not till thou 'exceed the world? Canst thou be like A prosperous nose-born wen, which sometimes grows To be far greater than the mother-nose? Go then, and as to thee, when thou didst go, Munster did towns, and Gesner authors show, Mount now to Gallo-Belgicus; appear As deep a statesman as a garreteer. Homely and familiarly, when thou com'st back, Talk of Will Conqueror, and Prester Jack. Go, bashful man, lest here thou blush to look Upon the progress of thy glorious book, To which both Indies sacrifices send; The West sent gold, which thou didst freely spend, Meaning to see 't no more upon the press: The East sends hither her deliciousness; And thy leaves must embrace what comes from hence, The myrrh, the pepper, and the frankincense. This magnifies thy leaves; but if they stoop To neighbor wares, when merchants do unhoop Voluminous barrels; if thy leaves do then Convey these wares in parcels unto men; If for vast tons of currants and of figs, Of med'cinal and aromatique twigs, Thy leaves a better method do provide, Divide to pounds, and ounces sub-divide; If they stoop lower yet, and vent our wares, Home-manufactures to thick popular Fairs; If omni-pregnant there, upon warm stalls They hatch all wares for which the buyer calls; Then thus thy leaves we justly may commend, That they all kind of matter comprehend. Thus thou, by means which th'Ancients never took, A Pandect mak'st and universal book. The bravest heroes for their country's good Scattered in divers lands their limbs and blood; Worst malefactors, to whom men are prize, Do public good, cut in anatomies: So will thy book in peeces; for a lord, Which casts at Portescue's, and all the board, Provide whole books; each leaf enough will be For friends to pass time, and keep company: Can all carouse up thee? no, thou must fit Measures, and fill out for the half-pint wit. Some shall wrap pills, and save a friend's life so; Some shall stop muskets, and so kill a foe. Thou shalt not ease the criticks of next age So much as once their hunger to assuage: Nor shall wit-pirats hope to find thee ly All in one bottom, in one Library. Some leaves may paste strings there in other books, And so one may which on another looks, Pilfer, alas, a little wit from you; But hardly much: and yet I think this true; As Sibil's was, your book is mystical, For every peece is as much worth as all. Therefore mine impotency I confess, The healths, which my brain bears, must be far less; The gyant wit 'orthrows me, I am gone; And rather then read all, I would read none. TO MY MOST FRIENDLY AND DESERVING BENJ. JONSON.Amicissimo et meritissimo Benj. Johnson. ON HIS ‘VOLPONE,’ OR THE FOX. What thou hast dared with thy poetic pen, If ancient teachers of the laws of men And God had dared to follow out like thee, Wise to salvation all of us would be. Those ancients, with what cobwebs they abound! Nor is such follower of those ancients found As thou, who, following, darest break new ground. Go on and prosper, then; and let thy books Put on from their first moment reverend looks: No literary effort childhood brooks. Old at their very birth books needs must be To which thou givest immortality. Genius and toil thee on a level place With ancients: them excel, that the new race Rise from our wickedness, in which, alas, Both past and future ages we surpass. Translation. TO MY VERY LEARNED FRIEND DR. ANDREWS. CONCERNING A PRINTED BOOK, WHICH, WHEN IT WAS BORROWED BY HIM, WAS TORN TO PIECES AT HIS HOUSE BY THE CHILDREN, AND AFTERWARDS RETURNED IN MANUSCRIPT. Damp from the press is born the current book, But manuscripts wear a more reverent look. To the Seine Mœnus passed, to Louis' home, From thence to Frankfort, in thy hands to roam. The book which, dyed with printers' ink, is thrust On shelves abandoned to the moths and dust, If writ with pen it reach us, is respected, And straight in ancient fathers' chests protected. Apollo must explain how boys can pour On a new book long years and aspect hoar. No wonder that a doctor's sons we see Able to give new book new destiny. If boys make old the recent, their sire's art To me an old man may new youth impart. Ah, poor old men! harsh age turns us, forsooth, To second childhood all, ne'er one to youth. 'Tis Thy prerogative, Ancient of Days, With life and youth to crown who on Thee gaze. The weariness of this frail life meanwhile With books and love heaven-during we beguile; Mid which that little book thou dost restore Ne'er was so dear, so much my own, before. II. FUNERAL ELEGIES. ELEGY ON MISTRISS BOULSTRED. Death, be not proud; thy hand gave not this blow, Sin was her captive, whence thy power doth flow; The executioner of wrath thou art, But to destroy the just is not thy part. Thy comming, terrour, anguish, grief denounces; Her happy state, courage, ease, joy pronounces. From out the crystal palace of her brest The clearer soul was call'd to endless rest— Not by the thundering voice wherewith God threats, But as with crownèd saints in heaven He treats— And, waited on by angels, home was brought, To joy that—it through many dangers sought— The key of mercy gently did unlock The doors 'twixt heaven and it, when life did knock. Nor boast, the fairest frame was made thy prey, Because to mortal eyes it did decay; A better witness than thou art assures That, though dissolv'd, it yet a space endures; No dram thereof shall want or loss sustain, When her best soul inhabits it again. Go, then, to people curst before they were, Their souls in triumph to thy conquest bear. Glory not thou thy self in these hot tears, Which our face, not for her, but our harm wears: The mourning livery given by Grace, not thee, Which wills our souls in these streams washt should be; And on our hearts, her memorie's best tomb, In this her epitaph doth write thy doom. Blind were those eyes saw not how bright did shine Through fleshe's misty vail those beams divine; Deaf were the eares not charm'd with that sweet sound Which did i' the spirit's instructed voice abound; Of flint the conscience, did not yeeld and melt At what in her last act it saw and felt. Weep not, nor grudg then, to have lost her sight, Taught thus, our after-staye's but a short night: But by all souls, not by corruption choaked, Let in high-raisèd notes that power be 'invoked; Calm the rough seas by which she sails to rest, From sorrows here to a 'kingdom ever blest. And teach this hymn of her with joy, and sing, The grave no conquest gets, Death hath no sting. III. LYRICAL. SONGS AND SONNETS, AND MISCELLANEOUS. TEN SONNETS TO PHILOMEL. Sonnet I. Vpon Loue's entring by his Eares. Oft did I heare, our Eyes the passage were By which Loue entred to auaile our hearts; Therefore I guarded them, and voyd of feare Neglected the defence of other parts. Loue knowing this, the vsuall way forsooke, And seeking, found a by-way by mine Eare: At which hee entring, my Hart pris'ner tooke, And vnto thee sweet Philomel did beare. Yet let my hart thy hart to pittie moue, Whose paine is great, although smal fault appeare: First it lies bound in fettering-chaines of Loue, Then each day it is rackt with hope and feare. And with Loue's flame 'tis euermore consumed, Only because to loue thee it presumed. Sonnet II. O why did Fame my Hart to Loue betray, By telling my Deare's vertue and perfection? Why did my Traytor Eares to it conuay That Syren-song, cause of my Hart's infection? Had I bene deafe, or Fame her gifts concealed, Then had my Hart been free from hopeles loue: Or were my state likewise by it reuealed, Well might it Philomel to pitty moue. Then shold she kno how loue doth make me l?guish, Distracting mee twixt hope and dreadful feare: Then shold she kno my care, my pla[i]nts and anguish; All which for her deere sake I meekely beare. Yea I could quietly Death's paynes abide, So that shee knew that for her sake I dide. Sonnet III. Of his owne and his Mistris' sicknes at one time. Sickenes entending my Loue to betray Before I should sight of my Deare obtaine, Did his pale collours in my face display, Lest that my Fauour might her fauour gaine. Yet not content hërewith, like meanes it wrought My Philomel's bright beauty to deface: And Nature's glory to disgrace it sought, That my conceiuèd Loue it might displace. But my firme Loue could this assault well beare, Which Vertue had, not beauty, for his ground: And yet bright beames of beauty did appeare, Throgh sicknes' vail, which made my loue abo?d. If sicke, thought I, her beauty so excell, How matchlesse would it bee if shee were well? Sonnet IV. Another of her Sicknes and Recouery. Pale Death himselfe did loue my Philomel, When hee her Vertues and rare beutie saw: Therefore hee Sicknesse sent, which should expell His riuall, Life, and my Deere to him draw. But her bright beauty dazeled so his Eyes, That his dart Life did misse, though her it hitt: Yet not therewith content, new meanes hee tries To bring her vnto Death, and make Life flitt. But Nature soone perceiuing, that hee meant To spoyle her only Phœnix, her chiefe pride, Assembled all her force, and did preuent The greatest mischiefe that could her betide. So both our liues and loues Nature defended, For had shee dide, my loue and life had ended. Sonnet V. Allusion to Theseus' Voyage to Crete against the Minotaure. My Loue is sayl'd, against Dislike to fight, Which, like vild monster, threatens his decay; The ship is Hope, which by Desire's great might, Is swiftly borne towards the wishèd Bay: The company which with my Loue doth fare, Though met in one, is a dissenting crew; They are Ioy, Greefe, and neuer-sleeping Care, And Doubt, which ne'r beleeues good news for true. Black feare the Flag is which my ship doth beare, Which, Deere, take downe, if my Loue victor be, And let white Comfort in his place appeare, When Loue victoriously returnes to mee, Lest I from rocke Despayre come tumbling downe, And in a Sea of Teares bee forc't to drowne. Sonnet VI. Vpon her looking secretly out of a window as hee passed by. Once did my Philomel reflect on mee Her christall-pointed Eyes as I passt by, Thinking not to be seene, yet would mee see; But soone my hungry Eyes their foode did spie. Alas, my Deere, couldst thou suppose that face, Which needs not enuy Phœbus' cheefest pride, Could secret bee, although in secret place, And that transparant glas such beams could hide? But if I had beene blinde, yet Loue's hot flame Kindled in my poore heart by thy bright Eye, Did plainely shew when it so neere thee came, By more then vsuall heate, the cause was mee: So, though thou hidden wert, my hart and eye Did turne to thee by mutuall Sympathy. Sonnet VII. When time nor place would let me often view Nature's chiefe Mirror and my sole delight; Her liuely Picture in my hart I drew, That I might it behold both day and night. But shee, like Phillip's Son, scorning that I Should portray her wanting Apelles' art, Commaunded Loue, who nought dare hir deny, To burne the Picture which was in my Hart. The more Loue burn'd, the more her picture shin'd; The more it shin'de, the more my hart did burne; So, what to hurt her picture was assign'd, To my Hart's ruine and decay did turne. Loue could not burne the Saint—it was diuine; And therefore fir'd my hart, the Saint's poore shrine. Sonnet VIII. When as the Sun eclipsèd is, some say It thunder, lightning, raine and wind portendeth: And not vnlike but such things happen may, Sith like effects my Sun eclipsèd sendeth. Witnes my throat made hoars with thundring cries, And hart with Loue's hot-flashing lightnings fired: Witnes the showers which stil fal from mine eies, And brest with sighs like stormy winds neare riued. Shine out, then, once againe, sweete Sun, on mee, And with thy beames dissolue clouds of dispaire, Whereof these raging Meteors framèd bee, In my poore hart by absence of my faire. So shalt thou proue thy Beames, thy heate, thy light, To match the Sun in glory, grace, and might. Sonnet IX. Vpon sending her a Gold Ring with this Posie ‘Pure and Endlesse.’ If you would knowe the loue which you I beare, Compare it with the Ring, which your faire hand Shall make more pretious when you shal it weare; So my loue's Nature you shal vnderstand. Is it of mettal pure? so you shall proue My loue, which ne're disloyal thought did stain. Hath it no end? so endles is my loue, Vnlesse you it destroy with your disdaine. Doth it the purer waxe the more 'tis tride? So doth my loue: yet herein they dissent, That whereas Gold the more 'tis purifi'd, By waxing lesse, doth shew some part is spent, My loue doth wax more pure by your more trying, And yet encreaseth in the purifying. Sonnet X. My Cruell Deere hauing captiu'de my hart, And bound it fast in Chaynes of restles Loue, Requires it out of bondage to depart; Yet is shee sure from her it cannot moue. Draw back, sayd shee, your hopelesse loue from me, Your work requireth a more worthy place; Vnto your sute though I cannot agree, Full many will it louingly embrace. It may bee so, my Deere; but as the Sun When it appeares doth make the stars to vanish, So when your selfe into my thoughts do run, All others quite out of my Hart you bannish. The beames of your Perfections shine so bright, That straightway they dispell all others' light. Melophilus. ON A FLEA ON HIS MISTRESS' BOSOM. Madam, that flea which crept between your brest I envyde that there he should make his rest; The little creature's fortune was soe good That angells' feed not on so precious food. How it did sucke, how eagerly sucke you!— Madam, shall fleas before me tickle you?— Oh, I not hould can; pardon if I kill yt! Sweet blood, to you I aske this, that which fill'd it Runne from my ladie's brest. Come, happie flea, That dyde for suckinge of that milky-sea. Oh, now againe I cold e'en wish thee there, About her hart, about her any where: I would vowe, deare flea, thou sholdst not dye, If [that] thou couldst suck from her her crueltie. ODE. [Absence, heere this my protestatyon] Absence, heere this my protestatyon Against thy strength, Distance, and length. Doe what thou canst for alteration, For hearts of truest mettle Absence doth joyne, and tyme doth settle. Who loues a mistris of such quallity, His mynd hath fownd Affection's grownd Beyond tyme, place and mortallitie. To harts that cannot varie Absence is present, Tyme doth tary. My senses want their outward motyon, Which now within Reason doth wynn, Redubled by her secret motion, Like rich that take pleasure In hyding more than handling treasure. By absence this good means I gaine, That I can catch her Where none can match her In some close corner of my brayne. There I imbrace, and there kisse her, And soe enioye her and none mysse her. THE TOKEN. Send me some tokens, that my hope may live, Or that my easeless thoughts may sleep and rest; Send me some hony, to make sweet my hive, That in my passions I may hope the best. I beg nor ribbon wrought with thy own hands, To knit our loves in the fantastic strain Of new-touch'd youth; nor ring to show the stands Of our affection, that, as that's round and plain, So should our loves meet in simplicity; No, nor the corals which thy wrist infold, Laced up together in congruity, To show our thoughts should rest in the same hold; No, nor thy picture, though most gracious, And most desired, 'cause 'tis like the best; Nor witty lines, which are most copious, Within the writings which thou hast addrest. Send me nor this, nor that, t' increase my score; But swear thou think'st I love thee, and no more. [[SELF-LOVE.]] He that cannot chuse but love, And strives against it still, Never shall my fancy move; For he loves against his will. Nor he which is all his own, And cannot pleasure chuse; When I am caught, he can be gone, And, when he list, refuse. Nor he that loves none but fair, For such by all are sought; Nor he that can for foul ones care, For his judgment then is naught. Nor he that hath wit, for he will Make me his jest or slave; Nor a fool, for when others He can neither Nor he that still his mistress prays, For she is thrall'd therefore; Nor he that payes not, for he says Within she's worth no more. Is there then no kind of men, Whom I may freely prove? I will venture that humor then In this mine own self-love. THE LADY AND HER VIOL. Why dost thou, deare, affect thy viol so, And let thy loue forlorne, w?? anguish go? Thou't kindly set him on thy lap, imbrace And almost kis, while I must voide y? place. Thou't string him truly, tune him sweetly, when Thou't wrest me out of tune and crack me then: Thou't stop his frets, but set no date to mine; Thou't giue what ere he wants, but let me pine. Thou knowest him hollow-harted, yet wilt heare Him throughout w?? an attentiue eare. And sing him such a pleasing lullaby, Would charme hel's churlish porter's watchfull eye; Keping true time w?? him as true may be, But finde no time to kepe y? true to me. Deare as y? instrument woulde I were thine, That thou mightst play on me, or thou wert mine. SLEEP. Care-charming Sleep, thou easer of all woes, Brother of Death! sweetly thy selfe dispose On this afflicted Wight; fall like a cloud In gentle show??; give nothing y? is lowd, Or painfull, to his slumbers: easy, sweet, And like a purling wind, thou sonn of Night! Passe by his troubled senses; sing his paine Like hollow murmuringe windes, or silver raine: Into his senses gently, O gently, slide, And kisse him into slumber, like a Bride. A PARADOX. Who soe termes Loue a fire, may like a poet Ffaine what hee will, for certaine cannot showe it; Ffor ffire nere burnes but when the fuell's neare, But Loue doth at most distance most appeare: Yet out of fire water did neuer goe, But teares from Loue abundantly doe flowe; Ffire still mounts vpward, but Loue oft descendeth; Ffire leaues the midst, Loue to the center tendeth; Ffire dryes &amp; hardens, Loue doth mollifie; Ffire doth consume, but Loue doth fructifie. The powerfull Queen of Loue (faire Venus) came Descended from the Sea, not from the flame; Whence passions ebbe &amp; flowe, &amp; from the braine Run to the hart, like streames, and back againe; Yea Loue oft fills men's breasts w?? melting snowe, Drowning their loue-sick minds in flouds of woe. What, is Loue water, then? it may be soe: But hee saith truest y? saith hee doth not knowe. DR. DONNE'S FAREWELL TO Y? WORLD. Farewell, you guilded follyes, pleasing troubles! Farewell, you honnered rages, you cristall bubbles! Fame's but a hollow eccho; gould pure clay; Honour is but y? darling of one day; Beauty, the 'eyes' idoll, but a damaske skinne; State but a goulden prison to keep in And torture freeborne mindes; embroiderèd traines But goodly pajants, proudly-swelling veines; Fame, riches, honour, state, traines, beautyes, birth, Are but y? fading blessings of y? earth. I would bee great, but see y? sunne doth still Levill his beames against y? rising hill; I would bee rich, but see men too unkind Dippe in y? bowels of y? richest minds; I would bee faire, but see y? champian proud The world's faire eye off-setting in a cloud; I would bee wise, but y? y? fox I see Suspected guilty when y? asse is free; I would bee poore, but see y? humble grasse Is trampl'd on by each unworthy asse. Rich hated, wise suspected, scorn'd if poore; Great fear'd, faire tempted, &amp; high envyed more: Would y? world now adopt mee for his heire; Would Beautye's Queene entitle mee y? faire; Fame speake mee Honour's mineon; could I vey The blisse of angells; w?? a speaking eye Command bare-heads, bow'd-knees, strike Justice domb As well as blind &amp; lame; &amp; give a tongue To stones by epitaphes; bee callèd Master In y? loose lines of every Poetaster; Could I bee more then any man y? lives Rich, wise, great, faire, all in superlatives; I count one minute of my holy leasure Beyond to much of all this empty pleasure. Welcome, pure thoughts! welcome, yee carelesse groanes! These are my guests, this is y? courtage tones: Ye wingèd people of y? skeyes shall sing Mine anthems; bee my sellar, gentle spring; Here dwells noe hopelesse loves, noe palsy feares, Noe short joyes purchas'd w?? eternall teares; Here will I sit, &amp; sigh my hot youth's folly, And learne to 'affect a holy malancholy; And if contentment bee a stranger, then Ile never looke for't but in Heaven againe; And when I dye Ile turne my cave Even from a chamber to a silent grave: The falling spring upon the rocke shall weare Mine epitaph, &amp; cause a breine teare From him who askes who in this tomb doth lye: The dolefull Eccho answeres: It is I. IF SHE DERYDE ME. Great and good, if she deryde mee, Let me walke, I'le not despaire; Ere to morrow I'le provide mee One as great, lesse prowd, more faire: Thay that seeke loue to constraine Haue their labour for their paine. They that strongly can impórtune, And will never yeild nor tyre, Gayne the pay in spight of Fortune; But such gaine I'le not desyre: Where they prize is shame or sinn: Wynners loose, and loosers wynn. Looke vpon the faithfull louer: Grief stands painted in his face; Groanes and teares and sighs discouer That they are his only grace: Hee must weepe as childrenn doe, That will in y? fashion wooe. I, whoe flie these idle fancies Which my dearest rest betraye, Warn'd by others' harmfull chances, Vse my freedome as I may. When all the world says what it cann, 'Tis but—Fie, vnconstant mann! SUN, BEGONE. Wherefore peepst thou, envyous Day? Wee can kisse without thee; Louers hate that golden raye Which thou bearst about thee. Goe and give them light that sorrowe, Or the saylor flyinge: Our imbraces need noe morrowe, Nor our kisses eyinge. We shall curse thy envyous eye For thy soone betrayinge; Or condemne thee for a spye, If thou findst vs playinge. Gett thee gone, and lend thy flashes Where there's need of lendinge: Our affections are not ashes, Nor our pleasures endinge. Were we cold or wyther'd heere, We would stay thee by vs; Or but one another's sphære, Then thou shouldst not flye vs. We are younge, thou spoilst our pleasure; Goe to sea and slumber; Darknes only lends vs leasure Our stolne joyes to number. MY HEART. Thou sent'st to me a hart was sound, I tooke it to be thine; But when I saw it had a wound, I knew that hart was myne. A bountie of a stronge conceit, To send myne owne to mee, And send it in a worse estate Then when it came to thee. The hart I sent thee had no stayne, It was entyre and sound; But thou hast sent it back againe Sicke of a deadly wound. Oh heavens, how woldst thou use a hart That should rebellyous bee, Since thou hast slayne myne with a dart That soe much honorde thee! FORTUNE NEVER FAILS. What if I come to my mistris' bedd, The candles all ecclip'st from shyninge: Shall I then attempt for her mayden-head, Or showe my selfe a coward by declyninge? Oh noe, Fie, do not soe; For thus much I knowe by devyninge, Blynd is Love, The darke it doth approve To pray on pleasures pantinge; What needs light For Cupid in y? night, If jealous eyes be wantinge? Fortune neuer fayles, if she bidd take place, To shroud all the faire proceedings: Love and she, though blynd, yet each other embrace To favor all their servants' meetings. Venture, I say, To sport and to play, If in place all be fittinge; Though she say fie, Yet doth she not denie, For fie is but a word of tryall: Jealosie doth sleepe; Then doe not weepe At force of a faynt denyall. Glorious is my loue, worth tryvmphs in her face; Then too-too bould were I to ventvr: Whoe loues, deserues to liue in princes' grace; Why stand you then affraid to enter? Lights are all out, Then make noe doubt, A louer bouldly may take chusinge. Bewtie is a baite For a princely mate. Fye, why stand you then a musing? Yow'le repent too late, If she doe you hate For love's delight refusinge. THE PORTRAIT. Painter, while there thou sitst drawing the sight That her unkind regard hath dyed in grief, Dip black thy pensill, and forgett the white That thou bestow'st on lookes that win beliefe; And when thy worke is done, then lett her see The humble image of her crueltie. Or if t'unfold the sence of her disdaine Exceeds the narrow limitts of thyne art, Then blott thy table, and forgett thy paine, Till thou hast learn'd the coulours of her hart; And lett her then no sight or other show But that void place where thou hast painted woe. Tell her that those whome th'Heauens' inuries Haue kept at sea in wandering disperation Sitt downe at length, and brag of misseries, The highest measure of their ostentation. So hath she tost me till my latest glorie Is her content, and my affliction's storie. Tell her that tears and sighs shall never cease With flowing streames, to sinck her in conceite, Till at the length shee pitty or release The gentle hart that on her eyes did waite, Pure lights imbracing in each other's scope The strength of faith and weaknesses of hope. Thus doe I breathe forth my unhappines, And play with rimes, as if my thoughts were free; Wherein if I had power but to expresse Her name, the world would with my griefs agree. But, idle veine! consume thyself in this, That I have sworn to bury what shee is. THREE LOVE-SONNETS. [I.] [Oh madam, you [only], of all women true] Oh madam, you [only], of all women true, Nay, Virtue's selfe, that's more, for only you Are that w?? we imagine to be shee; You, and but you, make virtue here to bee. You, who by binding makes us truly free, Whose only bondman lives in libertie. You, in w?? happie word all things are ment Excepting wickedness and punishment. You, that are you, w?? I love more than I, In whome my soule can rest, yett I not dye; Nay, lives, by beeing those, for that's his place, I, but a cabinet that keepes your face Or model in my hart, for all that's I May in your picture live, in you must dye. II. [Is there no day, madam, for you? is all] Is there no day, madam, for you? is all A sullen night? it is not out of choice; Ffor watchful virtue never did reioice In darknes, when it subiect was to fall. But you are ledd by some unluckie hand That guids yo'r feet into a path obscure, Yett lookes that you as steadily should stand As at nooneday, and keep your feet as pure. Oh, pardon mee; should I bee guided soe From light, from truth, and from the sight of men, My guides should to[o] late and [too] clearely know That darkness was the way to Error's den; And hee should feele, that bard me from y? light, The best tyme to revenge my wrongs were night. III. [Thou art not faire, for all thy redd and white] Thou art not faire, for all thy redd and white, Nor all thy rosy ornaments in thee; Thou art not sweete, though made of meere delight, Nor fair nor sweete, unless thou pitty mee. I will not sooth thy fancyes; thou shalt prove That beauty is noe beauty without loue. Yet love not mee, nor seeke thou to allure My thoughts with beauty, were it more divine; Thy smiles and kisses I can not indure; I'le not be wrapt up in those armes of thine. Now show it, if thou be a woman right, Embrace and kiss and love mee in despight. A WARNING. Victorious beauty! though your eyes Are able to subdue an host, And therefore are unlike to boast The taking of a little prize, Doe not a single heart despise. It came alone, but yet so armd With former loue, I durst have sworne That when a privy coate was worne With characters of beauty charmd, Thereby it might have 'scapd unharmed. But neither steele nor stony breast Are proofe against those looks of thyne; Nor can a beauty lesse divine Of any heart be long possesst When thou pretend'st an interest. Thy conquest in regard of me, Alas, is small; but in respect Of her that did my love protect, Were it divulged, deserves to bee Recorded for a victory. And such a one—as some that view Her lovely face perhapps may say, Though you have stolen my heart away— If all your seruants prove not true, May steal a heart or two from you. TO THE YOUNG GENTLEWOMEN AT COURT. Beware, fair maide, of musky courtiers' oaths; Take heed what gifts and favours you receive; Let not the fading glosse of silken cloathes Dazell thy virtues, or thy fame bereave: For loose but once the hould thou hast of grace, Who will respect thy favour or thy face? Each greedy hand doth catch to spoil the flower, Where none regards the stalk it grew upon; Each creature loues the fruit still to devoure, And let the tree to fall or grow alone. But this advise, faire creature, take from mee: Let none take fruit, unless he take the tree. Believe not oathes nor much-protesting men, Creditt no vowes, nor no bewailing songs; Let courtiers sweare, forsweare, and sweare agayne, Their heart doth live two regions from their tongues; And when with oathes the heart is made to tremble, Believe them least, for then they most dissemble. Take heed, lest Cæsar do corrupt thy mind, And foul ambition sell thy modesty; Say tho' a king thou euer curteous find, He cannot pardon thy impurity; For doe with king, to subject you will fall, From lord to lackey, and at last to all. BELIEVE YOUR GLASSE. Beleeve your glasse, and if it tell you, Deare, Your eyes inshrine A brighter shine Then faire Apollo; looke if there appeare The milkie skye, The crimson dye Mixt in your cheeks; and then bid Phœbus sett: More glory then hee owes appeares. But yet Be not deceivèd with fond exultacon: As Cynthia's globe, A snow-white robe, Is soonest spotted; a carnation dye Fades and discolours, opened but to die. Make vse of yowth and bewty whilest they flourish: Tyme never sleepes; Though it but creeps, It still gets forward. Do not vainly nourish Them to selfe-vse, It is abuse; The richest grownds lying wast turn boggs and rott, And soe beinge useles were as good were not. Walke in a meddowe by a river side, Vpon whose bancks Growe milk-white ranks Of full-blowne lyllies in their height of pryde, Which downward bend, And nothing tend Save their owne bewties in the glassie streame: Looke to your selfe; compare your selfe to them— To them, in bewtie: marke what followes then; Sommer must end, The sunn must bend His longe-abstracted beames to others: then, Their Spring being crost By Wynter's frost, And snep'd by bytter stormes 'gainst which nought boots, They bend their prowd topps lower then their roots. Then none regard them but with heedles feet: In durt each treads Their declyn'd heads. Soe when youth's wasted, Age and you shall meet: Then I alone Shall sadly moane That interviewe; others it will not move; So light regard we what we little love. V. DIVINE POEMS. TO VISCOUNT DONCASTER, WITH SIX HOLY SONNETS. See, Sir, how as the sun's hot masculine flame Begets strange creatures on Nile's durty slime, In me your fatherly yet lusty ryme (For these songs are their fruits) have wrought the same. But though the ingendring force from whence they came Be strong enough, and Nature doth admit Seven to be born at once, I send as yet But six; they say the seventh hath still some maim. I choose your Judgment, which the same degree Doth with her sister, your Invention, hold, As fire, these drossie rhymes to purifie; Or as elixar, to change them to gold. You are that alchymist, which always had Wit, whose one spark could make good things of bad. TO THE LADY MAGDALEN HERBERT; OF ST. MARY MAGDALEN. Her of your name, whose fair inheritance Bethina was, and jointure Magdalo; An active faith so highly did advance, That she once knew more than the Church did know, The Resurrection; so much good there is Deliver'd of her, that some Fathers be Loth to believe one woman could do this, But think these Magdalens were two or three. Increase their number, Lady, and their fame; To their devotion add your innocence; Take so much of th'example as of the name, The latter half; and in some recompence, That they did harbour Christ Himself a guest, Harbour these Hymns, to His dear name addrest. J. D. ON THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARIE. In that, O Queene of queens, thy birth was free From that which others doth of grace bereave, When in their mothers' wombs they life receave, God, as his sole-borne daughter, louèd thee. To match thee like thy birth's nobilitie, He thee his Spirit for his spouse did leaue, By whom thou didst his only Sonne conceave, And so wast linkt to all the Trinity. Cease then, O queens that earthly crowns do wear, To glory in the pompe of earthly thinges; If men such high respects unto you beare, Which daughters, wiues, and mothers are to kinges, What honor can unto that Queene bee done, Who had your God for Father, Spowse, and Sonne? ODE. [Vengeance will sitt aboue our faults; but till] Vengeance will sitt aboue our faults; but till She there do sytt, We see her not, nor them. Thus blynd, yet still Wee lead her way; and thus whilst we doe ill, Wee suffer it. Unhappy hee whom youth makes not beware Of doinge ill: Enough we labour under age and care; In number th'errors of the last place are The greatest still. Yet wee, that should the ill we new begin As soone repent— Strange thing—perceiue not; our faults are not seene, But past us, neither felt, but only in Our punishment. But we know ourselves least; meere outward showes Our mynds so store, That our sowles, noe more then our eyes, disclose But forme and colour. Only hee who knowes Himselfe knowes more. TRANSLATED OUT OF GAZÆUS, VOTA AMICO FACTA, fol. 160. God grant thee thine own wish, and grant thee mine, Thou who dost, best friend, in best things outshine; May thy soul, ever chearful, ne'r know cares; Nor thy life, ever lively, know gray hairs; Nor thy hand, ever open, know base holds; Nor thy purse, ever plump, know pleits or folds; Nor thy tongue, ever true, know a false thing; Nor thy words, ever mild, know quarrelling; Nor thy works, ever equal, know disguise; Nor thy fame, ever pure, know contumelies; Nor thy prayers know low objects, still divine. God grant thee thine own wish, and grant thee mine! A SHEAF OF SNAKES USED HERETOFORE TO BE MY SEAL, THE CREST OF OUR POOR FAMILY. Adopted in God's family, and so Our old coat lost, unto new arms I go. The cross, my seal at baptism, spread below, Does, by that form into an anchor grow. Crosses grow anchors; bear, as thou shouldst do, Thy cross, and that cross grows an anchor too. But He that makes our crosses anchors thus, Is Christ, Who there is crucifi'd for us. Yet may I, with this, my first serpents hold; God gives new blessings, and yet leaves the old. The serpent may, as wise, my pattern be; My poison, as he feeds on dust, that's me. And as he rounds the earth to murder sure, My death he is; but on the cross, my cure. Crucifie nature then, and then implore All grace from Him, crucified there before; When all is cross, and that cross anchor grown, This seal's a catechism, not a seal alone. Under that little seal great gifts I send, Works and prayers, pawns, and fruits of a friend. And may that saint, which rides in our Great Seal, To you, who bear His name, great bounties deal. IN SACRAM ANCHORAM PISCATORIS, G. HERBERT THE SAME IN ENGLISH. Although the Cross could not Christ here detain, Though nail'd unto 't, but He ascends again, Nor yet thy eloquence here keep Him still, But only while thou speak'st, this Anchor will. Nor canst thou be content, unless thou to This certain Anchor add a seal, and so The water and the earth both unto thee Do owe the symbole of their certainty. When Love, being weary, made an end Of kind expressions to his friend, He writ: when's hand could write no more, He gave the Seal, and so left o're. How sweet a friend was he, who, being griev'd His letters were broke rudely up, believ'd 'Twas more secure in great Love's Common-weal, Where nothing should be broke, to adde a Seal! Let the world reel, we and all ours stand sure; This holy cable's of all storms secure. LAMENT FOR HIS WIFE. [Is Death so greate a gamster, that he throwes] Is Death so greate a gamster, that he throwes Still at the fairest? must I ever lose? Are we all but as tarriers, first begun, Made, and togeather put, to be undone? Will all the ranke of frendes in whom I trust, Like Sodome's trees, yeild me no fruit but dust? Must all I love, as carelesse sparkes that flye Out of a flinte, but shew their worth and dye? O where do my-for-ever-losses tend? I could already by some buried frend Count my unhappy yeares: and should the sun Leave me in darkenesse as her losse hath done, By those few frendes I have yet to entombe I might, I feare, account my yeares to come. What neede our canons then be so precise In registers for our nativities? They keep us but in bondes, and strike with feares Rich parents, till their children be of yeares. For should all lose and mourne, they might, as I, Number their yeares by every elegie. Those bookes to summe our dayes might well have stood In use with those that liv'd before the Flood. When she indeed that forceth me to write Should have been borne, had Nature done her right, And at five hundred yeares be lesse decayd Than now at twenty is the fairest mayd. But Nature had not her perfection then, Or, being loath for such longe-liveinge men To spend the treasure which she held so pure, She gave them women apter to endure; Or providently knowinge there were more Countreyes which askd for people from her store, Nature was thrifty, and did thinke it well If for some one parte each one did excell— As this for her neate hand, that for her hayre, A third for her fine foote, a fourth was fayre. And seld' all beauties mett in one, till she— All others' lands els stor'd—came finally To people our sweet Isle, and seeinge now Her substance infinite, she 'gan to bowe To Lavishnes in every nuptiall bed, And she her fairest was that now is dead. Dead, as my ioyes for ever, ever be! And if a woman fayre and good as she Tread on her, grant O may she there become A statue like Lott's wife, and be her tombe! Or let the purple violett grow there, And knowe no revolution of the yeare, But full of dew with ever-droopinge head, Shew how I live since my best hopes are dead. Dead as the world to virtue. Murthers, theeves, Can have their pardons, or at least repreives; The sword of Iustice hath beene often won By letters from an execution. Yet vowes nor prayers could not keepe thee here, Nor shall I see thee next returninge yeare; Thee, with the roses, springe and live againe. Th'art lost for ever as a drop of raine Falne in a river: for as soone I may Take up that drop, or meet the same at sea And knowe it there, as e'er redeeme thee gone, Or knowe thee in the grave when I have one. O had that hollow vault where thou dost lye An eccho in it, my stronge phantasy Would winne me soone to thinke her wordes were thine, And I would howerly come, and to thy shrine Talke, as I often did to talke with thee, And frame my wordes, that thou shouldst answer me As when thou livedst. I'd sigh and say I lov'd, And thou shouldst doe so too, till we had mov'd, With our complaints, to teares each marble cell Of those dead neighbours which about thee dwell. And when the holy Father came to say His orisons, wee'd aske him if the day Of miracles were past, or whether he Knowes any one whose fayth and pietie Could raise the dead; but he would answere, None Can bringe thee backe to life: though many one Our cursed dayes afford, that dare to thrust Their hands prophane, to raise the sacred dust Of holy saintes out of their beds of rest. Abhorred crimes! Oh may there none molest Thy quiet peace, but in thy arke remaine Untoucht, as those the old one did containe; Till He that can reward thy greatest worth Shall send the peacefull Dove to fetch thee forth!</field>
