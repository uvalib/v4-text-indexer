[VIII.] Ande al grayþed in grene þis gome &amp; his wedes, A strayt cote ful stre?t, þat stek on his sides, A mere mantile abof, mensked with-inne With pelure pured apert, þe pane ful clene, With blyþe blaunner ful bry?t, &amp; his hod boþe, Þat wat? la?t fro his lokke? &amp; layde on his schulderes; Heme-wel haled hose of þat same grene, Þat spenet on his sparlyr, &amp; clene spures vnder, Of bry?t golde, vpon silk bordes, barred ful ryche, &amp; scholes vnder schankes, þere þe schalk rides; &amp; alle his vesture uerayly wat? clene verdure, Boþe þe barres of his belt &amp; oþer blyþe stones, Þat were richely rayled in his aray clene, Aboutte hym-self &amp; his sadel, vpon silk werke?, Þat were to tor for to telle of tryfles þe halue Þat were enbrauded abof, wyth bryddes &amp; fly?es, With gay gaudi of grene, þe golde ay in-myddes; Þe pendauntes of his payttrure, þe proude cropure, His molaynes &amp; alle þe metail anamayld was þenne, Þe steropes, þat he stod on, stayned of þe same, &amp; his arsoun? al after, &amp; his aþel s[k]urtes, Þat euer glemered &amp; glent al of grene stones. Þe fole þat he ferkkes on, fyn of þat ilke, sertayn; A grene hors gret &amp; þikke, A stede ful stif to strayne, In brawden brydel quik, To þe gome he wat? ful gayn. [IX.] Wel gay wat? þis gome gered in grene, &amp; þe here of his hed of his hors swete; Fayre fannand fax vmbe-foldes his schulderes; A much berd as a busk ouer his brest henges, Þat wyth his hi?lich here, þat of his hed reches, Wat? euesed al vmbe-torne, a-bof his elbowes, Þat half his armes þer-vnder were halched in þe wyse Of a kynge? capados, þat closes his swyre. þe mane of þat mayn hors much to hit lyke, Wel cresped &amp; cemmed wyth knottes ful mony, Folden in wyth fildore aboute þe fayre grene, Ay a herle of þe here, an oþer of golde; Þe tayl &amp; his toppyng twynnen of a sute, &amp; bounden boþe wyth a bande of a bry?t grene, Dubbed wyth ful dere stone?, as þe dok lasted; Syþen þrawen wyth a þwong, a þwarle-knot alofte, Þer mony belle? ful bry?t of brende golde rungen. Such a fole vpon folde, ne freke þat hym rydes, Wat? neuer sene in þat sale wyth sy?t er þat tyme, with y?e; He loked as layt so ly?t, So sayd al þat hym sy?e; Hit semed as no mon my?t Vnder his dyntte? dry?e. [X.] Wheþer hade he no helme ne hawb[e]rgh nauþer, Ne no pysan, ne no plate þat pented to armes, Ne no schafte, ne no schelde, to schwue ne to smyte, Bot in his on honde he hade a holyn bobbe, Þat is grattest in grene when greue? ar bare, &amp; an ax in his oþer, a hoge &amp; vn-mete, A spetos sparþe to expoun in spelle quo-so my?t; Þe hede of an eln?erde þe large lenkþe hade, Þe grayn al of grene stele &amp; of golde hewen, Þe bit burnyst bry?t, with a brod egge, As wel schapen to schere as scharp rasores; Þe stele of a stif staf—þe sturne hit bi-grypte— Þat wat? wounden wyth yrn to þe wande? ende, &amp; al bigrauen with grene, in gracios werkes, A lace lapped aboute, þat louked at þe hede, &amp; so after þe halme halched ful ofte, Wyth tryed tassele? þerto tacched in-noghe, On botoun? of þe bry?t grene brayden ful ryche. Þis haþel helde? hym in, &amp; þe halle entres, Driuande to þe he?e dece, dut he no woþe, Haylsed he neuer one, bot he?e he ouer loked. Þe fyrst word þat he warp, ‘wher is,’ he sayd, ‘Þe gouernour of þis gyng? gladly I wolde Se þat segg in sy?t, &amp; with hym-self speke raysoun.’ To kny?te? he kest his y?e, &amp; reled hym vp &amp; doun, He stemmed &amp; con studie Quo walt þer most renoun. [XI.] Ther wat? lokyng on lenþe, þe lude to be-holde, For vch mon had meruayle quat hit mene my?t Þat a haþel &amp; a horse my?t such a hwe lach As growe grene as þe gres &amp; grener hit semed, Þen grene aumayl on golde [g]lowande bry?ter; Al studied þat þer stod, &amp; stalked hym nerre, Wyth al þe wonder of þe worlde what he worch schulde. For fele sellye? had þay sen, bot such neuer are, For-þi for fantoum &amp; fayry?e þe folk þere hit demed; Þer-fore to answare wat? ar?e mony aþel freke, &amp; al stouned at his steuen, &amp; stonstil seten In a swoghe-sylence þur? þe sale riche; As al were slypped vpon slepe so slaked hor lote? in hy?e. I deme hit not al for doute, Bot sum for cortaysye; Bot let hym þat al schulde loute, Cast vnto þat wy?e. [XII.] Þenn Arþour bifore þe hi? dece þat auenture byholde?, &amp; rekenly hym reuerenced, for rad was he neuer, &amp; sayde, ‘wy?e, welcum iwys to þis place, Þe hede of þis ostel Arthour I hat; Li?t luflych adoun, &amp; lenge, I þe praye, &amp; quat-so þy wylle is, we schal wyt after.’ ‘Nay, as help me,’ quoþ þe haþel, ‘he þat on hy?e syttes, To wone any quyle in þis won, hit wat? not myn ernde; Bot for þe los of þe, lede, is lyft vp so hy?e, &amp; þy bur? &amp; þy burnes best ar holden, Stifest vnder stel-gere on stedes to ryde, Þe wy?test &amp; þe worþyest of þe worldes kynde, Preue for to play wyth in oþer pure layke?, &amp; here is kydde cortaysye, as I haf herd carp, &amp; þat hat? wayned me hider, i-wyis, at þis tyme. ?e may be seker bi þis braunch þat I bere here Þat I passe as in pes, &amp; no ply?t seche; For had I founded in fere, in fe?tyng wyse, I haue a hauberghe at home &amp; a helme boþe, A schelde &amp; a scharp spere, schinande bry?t, Ande oþer weppenes to welde, I wene wel als; Bot for I wolde no were, my wede? ar softer.

For-þy I craue in þis court a crystemas gomen, For hit is ?ol &amp; nwe ?er, &amp; here ar ?ep mony; If any so hardy in þis hous holde? hym-seluen, Be so bolde in his blod, brayn in hys hede, Þat dar stifly strike a strok for an oþer, I schal gif hym of my gyft þys giserne ryche, Þis ax, þat is heue in-nogh, to hondele as hym lykes, &amp; I schal bide þe fyrst bur, as bare as I sitte. If any freke be so felle to fonde þat I telle, Lepe ly?tly me to, &amp; lach þis weppen, I quit-clayme hit for euer, kepe hit as his auen, &amp; I schal stonde hym a strok, stif on þis flet, Elle? þou wyl di?t me þe dom to dele hym an oþer, barlay; &amp; ?et gif hym respite A twelmonyth &amp; a day; Now hy?e, &amp; let se tite Dar any her-inne o?t say.’ [XIV.] If he hem stowned vpon fyrst, stiller were þanne Alle þe hered-men in halle, þe hy? &amp; þe lo?e; Þe renk on his rounce hym ruched in his sadel, &amp; runisch-ly his rede y?en he reled aboute, Bende his bresed bro?e?, blycande grene, Wayued his berde for to wayte quo-so wolde ryse. When non wolde kepe hym with carp he co?ed ful hy?e, Ande rimed hym ful richly, &amp; ry?t hym to speke: ‘What, is þis Arþures hous,’ quoþ þe haþel þenne, ‘Þat al þe rous rennes of þur? ryalmes so mony? Where is now your sourquydrye &amp; your conquestes, Your gry[n]del-layk &amp; your greme &amp; your grete wordes?

[XV.] Ande sayde, ‘haþel, by heuen þyn askyng is nys, &amp; as þou foly hat? frayst, fynde þe be-houes; I know no gome þat is gast of þy grete wordes. Gif me now þy geserne, vpon Gode? halue, &amp; I schal bayþen þy bone þat þou boden habbes.’ Ly?tly lepe? he hym to, &amp; la?t at his honde; Þen feersly þat oþer freke vpon fote ly?tis. Now hat?

Þe stif mon hym bifore stod vpon hy?t, Herre þen ani in þe hous by þe hede &amp; more; Wyth sturne schere þer he stod, he stroked his berde, &amp; wyth a countenaunce dry?e he dro? doun his cote, No more mate ne dismayd for hys mayn dinte?, Þen any burne vpon bench hade bro?t hym to drynk of wyne. Gawan, þat sate bi þe quene, To þe kyng he can enclyne, ‘I be-seche now with sa?e? sene Þis melly mot be myne.’ [XVI.] ‘Wolde ?e, worþilych lorde,’ quoþ [W]awan to þe kyng, ‘Bid me bo?e fro þis benche &amp; stonde by yow þere, Þat I wyth-oute vylanye my?t voyde þis table, &amp; þat my legge lady lyked not ille, I wolde com to your counseyl, bifore your cort ryche.

[XVII.] Þen comaunded þe kyng þe kny?t for to ryse; &amp; he ful radly vp ros, &amp; ruchched hym fayre, Kneled doun bifore þe kyng, &amp; cache? þat weppen; &amp; he luflyly hit hym laft, &amp; lyfte vp his honde, &amp; gef hym Godde? blessyng, &amp; gladly hym biddes Þat his hert &amp; his honde schulde hardi be boþe. ‘Kepe þe, cosyn,’ quoþ þe kyng, ‘þat þou on kyrf sette, &amp; if þou rede? hym ry?t, redly I trowe Þat þou schal byden þe bur þat he schal bede after.’ Gawan got? to þe gome, with giserne in honde, &amp; he baldly hym byde?, he bayst neuer þe helder. Þen carppe? to sir Gawan þe kny?t in þe grene, ‘Refourme we oure for-wardes, er we fyrre passe. Fyrst I eþe þe, haþel, how þat þou hattes, Þat þou me telle truly, as I tryst may.’ ‘In god fayth,’ quoþ þe goode kny?t, ‘Gawan I hatte, Þat bede þe þis buffet, quat-so bi-falle? after, &amp; at þis tyme twelmonyth take at þe anoþer, Wyth what weppen [s]o þou wylt, &amp; wyth no wy? elle? on lyue.’ Þat oþer on-sware? agayn, ‘Sir Gawan, so mot I þryue, As I am ferly fayn Þis dint þat þou schal dryue.’ [XVIII.] ‘Bi gog,’ quoþ þe grene kny?t, ‘sir Gawan, me lykes Þat I schal fange at þy fust þat I haf frayst here; &amp; þou hat? redily rehersed, bi resoun ful trwe, Clanly al þe couenaunt þat I þe kynge asked, Saf þat þou schal siker me, segge, bi þi trawþe, Þat þou schal seche me þi-self, where-so þou hopes I may be funde vpon folde, &amp; foch þe such wages As þou deles me to-day bifore þis douþe ryche.’ ‘Where schulde I wale þe,’ quoþ Gauan, ‘where is þy pla[c]e?

Bot teche me truly þer-to, &amp; telle me howe þou hattes, &amp; I schal ware alle my wyt to wynne me þeder, &amp; þat I swere þe forsoþe, &amp; by my seker traweþ.’ ‘Þat is in-nogh in nwe ?er, hit nedes no more,’ Quoþ þe gome in þe grene to Gawan þe hende, ‘?if I þe telle trwly, quen I þe tape haue, &amp; þou me smoþely hat? smyten, smartly I þe teche Of my hous &amp; my home &amp; myn owen nome, Þen may þou frayst my fare, &amp; forwarde? holde, &amp; if I spende no speche, þenne spede? þou þe better, For þou may leng in þy londe &amp; layt no fyrre, bot slokes; Ta now þy grymme tole to þe, &amp; let se how þou cnoke?.’ ‘Gladly, sir, for soþe,’ Quoþ Gawan; his ax he strokes. [XIX.] The grene kny?t vpon grounde grayþely hym dresses, A littel lut with þe hede, þe lere he discouere?, His longe louelych lokke? he layd ouer his croun, Let þe naked nec to þe note schewe. Gauan gripped to his ax &amp; gederes hit on hy?t, Þe kay fot on þe folde he be-fore sette, Let hit doun ly?tly ly?t on þe naked, Þat þe scharp of þe schalk schyndered þe bones, &amp; schrank þur? þe schyire grece, &amp; sc[h]ade hit in twynne, Þat þe bit of þe broun stel bot on þe grounde.

Þe rayne, &amp; hi[t] riche[d] with a ro?e braunche; Þenne he bo?e? to þe ber?e, aboute hit he walke?, Debatande with hym-self quat hit be my?t. Hit hade a hole on þe ende &amp; on ayþer syde, &amp; ouer-growen with gresse in glodes ay-where, &amp; al wat? hol? in-with, nobot an olde caue, Or a creuisse of an olde cragge; he couþe hit no?t deme with spelle, ‘We, lorde,’ quoþ þe gentyle kny?t, ‘Wheþer þis be þe grene chapelle? He[re] my?t aboute myd-ny?t Þe dele his matynnes telle.’ [IX.] ‘Now i-wysse,’ quoþ Wowayn, ‘wysty is here; Þis oritore is vgly, with erbe? ouer-growen; Wel biseme? þe wy?e wruxled in grene Dele here his deuocioun on þe deuele? wyse; Now I fele hit is þe fende, in my fyue wytte?, Þat hat? stoken me þis steuen, to strye me here; Þis is a chapel of meschaunce,—þat chekke hit by-tyde! Hit is þe corsedest kyrk þat euer I com inne.’ With he?e helme on his hede, his launce in his honde, He rome? vp to þe roffe of þo ro? wone?; Þene herde he of þat hy?e hil, in a harde roche, Bi?onde þe broke, in a bonk, a wonder breme noyse. Quat! hit clatered in þe clyff as hit cleue schulde, As one vpon a gryndelston hade grounden a syþe; What! hit wharred &amp; whette as water at a mulle. What! hit rusched &amp; ronge, rawþe to here. Þenne ‘bi Godde,’ quoþ Gawayn, ‘þat gere a[s] I trowe, Is ryched at þe reuerence me, renk, to mete bi rote; Let God worche; we loo, Hit helppe? me not a mote. My lif þa?

For now is gode Gawayn goande ry?t here, If any wy?e o?t wyl, wynne hider fast, Oþer now oþer neuer, his nede? to spede.’ ‘Abyde,’ quoþ on on þe bonke abouen ouer his hede, ‘&amp; þou schal haf al in hast þat I þe hy?t ones.’ ?et he rusched on þat rurde rapely a þrowe, &amp; wyth quettyng a-wharf, er he wolde ly?t; &amp; syþen he keuere? bi a cragge &amp; come? of a hole, Whyrlande out of a wro wyth a felle weppen, A dene? ax nwe dy?t, þe dynt with [t]o ?elde, With a borelych bytte bende by þe halme, Fyled in a fylor, fowre fote large, Hit wat? no lasse, bi þat lace þat lemed ful bry?t. &amp; þe gome in þe grene gered as fyrst, Boþe þe lyre &amp; þe legge?, lokke? &amp; berde, Saue þat fayre on his fote he founde? on þe erþe, Sette þe stele to þe stone &amp; stalked bysyde. When he wan to þe watter, þer he wade nolde, He hypped ouer on hys ax, &amp; orpedly stryde?, Bremly broþe on a bent þat brode wat? a-boute, on snawe. Sir Gawayn þe kny?t con mete, He ne lutte hym no þyng lowe, Þat oþer sayde, ‘now, sir swete, Of steuen mon may þe trowe.’ [XI.] ‘Gawayn,’ quoþ þat grene gome, ‘God þe mot loke! I-wysse þou art welco[m], wy?e, to my place, &amp; þou hat? tymed þi trauayl as truee mon schulde; &amp; þou knowe? þe couenaunte? kest vs by-twene: At þis tyme twelmonyth þou toke þat þe falled, &amp; I schulde at þis nwe ?ere ?eply þe quyte. &amp; we ar in þis valay verayly oure one, Here ar no renkes vs to rydde, rele as vs like?; Haf þy helme of þy hede, &amp; haf here þy pay; Busk no more debate þen I þe bede þenne When þou wypped of my hede at a wap one.’ ‘Nay, bi God,’ quoþ Gawayn, ‘þat me gost lante, I schal gruch þe no grwe for grem þat falle?; Bot sty?tel þe vpon on strok, &amp; I schal stonde stylle &amp; warp þe no wernyng to worch as þe lyke?, no-whare.’ He lened with þe nek &amp; lutte &amp; schewed þat schyre al bare &amp; lette as he no?t dutte, For drede he wolde not dare. [XII.] Then þe gome in þe grene grayþed hym swyþe, Gedere? vp hys grymme tole, Gawayn to smyte; With alle þe bur in his body he ber hit on lofte, Munt as ma?tyly as marre hym he wolde; Hade hit dryuen adoun as dre? as he atled, Þer hade ben ded of his dynt þat do?ty wat? euer. Bot Gawayn on þat giserne glyfte hym bysyde, As hit com glydande adoun on glode hym to schende, &amp; schranke a lytel with þe schulderes for þe scharp yrne. Þat oþer schalk wyth a schunt þe schene wyth-halde?, &amp; þenne repreued he þe prynce with mony prowde worde?: ‘Þou art not Gawayn,’ quoþ þe gome, ‘þat is so goud halden, Þat neuer ar?ed for no here by hylle ne be vale, &amp; now þou fles for ferde er þou fele harme?; Such cowardise of þat kny?t cowþe I neuer here. Nawþer fyked I ne fla?e, freke, quen þou myntest, Ne kest no kauelacion in kynge? hous Arthor. My hede fla? to my fote, &amp; ?et fla?

[XIII.] Bot busk, burne, bi þi fayth, &amp; bryng me to þe poynt, Dele to me my destine &amp; do hit out of honde, For I schal stonde þe a strok, &amp; start no more Til þyn ax haue me hitte, haf here my trawþe.’ ‘Haf at þe þenne,” quoþ þat oþer, &amp; heue? hit alofte, &amp; wayte? as wroþely as he wode were; He mynte? at hym ma?tyly, bot not þe mon ryne?, With-helde heterly h[i]s honde er hit hurt my?t. Gawayn grayþely hit byde? &amp; glent with no membre, Bot stode stylle as þe ston oþer a stubbe auþer Þat raþeled is in roche-grounde with rote? a hundreth. Þen muryly efte con he mele, þe mon in þe grene, ‘So now þou hat? þi hert holle, hitte me bihou[e]s. Halde þe now þe hy?e hode þat Arþur þe ra?t, &amp; kepe þy kanel at þis kest, ?if hit keuer may!’ G[awayn] ful gryndelly with greme þenne sayde, ‘Wy, þresch on, þou þro mon, þou þrete? to longe, I hope þat þi hert ar?e wyth þyn awen seluen.’ ‘Forsoþe,’ quoþ þat oþer freke, ‘so felly þou speke?, I wyl no lenger on lyte lette þin ernde ri?t nowe.’ Þenne tas he hym stryþe to stryke &amp; frounses boþe lyppe &amp; browe, No meruayle þa? hym myslyke Þat hoped of no rescowe. [XIV.] He lyftes ly?tly his lome &amp; let hit doun fayre With þe barbe of þe bitte biþe bare nek; Þa? he homered heterly, hurt hym no more Bot snyrt hym on þat on syde, þat seuered þe hyde; Þe scharp schrank to þe flesche þur? þe schyre grece, Þat þe schene blod ouer his schulderes schot to þe erþe. &amp; quen þe burne se? þe blode blenk on þe snawe, He sprit forth spenne-fote more þen a spere lenþe, Hent heterly his helme &amp; on his hed cast, Schot with his schuldere? his fayre schelde vnder, Brayde? out a bry?t sworde, &amp; bremely he speke?,— Neuer syn þat he wat? burne borne of his moder, Wat? he neuer in þis worlde wy?e half so blyþe— ‘Blynne, burne, of þy bur, bede me no mo; I haf a stroke in þis sted with-oute stryf hent, &amp; if þow reche? me any mo, I redyly schal quyte &amp; ?elde ?ederly a?ayn, &amp; þer-to ?e tryst, &amp; foo; Bot on stroke here me falle?, Þe couenaunt schop ry?t so, [Fettled] in Arþure? halle?, &amp; þer-fore, hende, now hoo!’ [XV.] The haþel heldet hym fro &amp; on his ax rested, Sette þe schaft vpon schore &amp; to þe scharp lened &amp; loked to þe leude þat on þe launde ?ede, How þat do?ty dredles deruely þer stonde?, Armed ful a?le?; in hert hit hym lyke?. Þenn he mele? muryly wyth a much steuen, &amp; wyth a ry[n]kande rurde he to þe renk sayde, ‘Bolde burne, on þis bent be not so gryndel; No mon here vn-manerly þe mys-boden habbe[?], Ne kyd bot as couenaunde at kynge? kort schaped.

Þe forme worde vpon folde þat þe freke meled,— ‘Corsed worth cowarddyse &amp; couetyse boþe!
