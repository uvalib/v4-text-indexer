      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ROXBURGHE, WHOSE SKILL AND EXPERIENCE AS A SALMON-FISHER ARE ONLY EXCELLED BY THE GENEROSITY HE HAS UNIFORMLY SHOWN TOWARDS THE LOVERS OF RIVER-SIDE SPORTS; AND TO WHOM, FOR HIS EXERTIONS IN CONNEXION WITH THE TWEED ACTS NOW IN FORCE, BOTH THE ANGLING COMMUNITY AT LARGE, AND THE OWNERS OF SALMON-FISHINGS ON THE BORDER RIVERS, ARE GREATLY INDEBTED, THIS VOLUME IS MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED. A LOCH SCENE. I Never in dream-land met the eye A scene so fair and witching; Lake, heath, and forest, hill and dale, And, gilding all in its farewell, A sunset so enriching! II The chasten'd rapture of that hour Steals, like a vision, o'er me; I see again the mirror'd heightsâ The tranquil blending of delights In the sweet lake before me. III A ruin on its islet stands, The walls with ivy pendant, Its grey stones crumbling underneath, Peer coldly through the shroud-like wreath Of that untrain'd ascendant. IV But glancing from the record rude Of the remoter ages, Behold the image of a stag, Timorous of the water-flag, Its eager thirst assuages! V The stately antlers branching free Above its forehead tragicâ The form of animated grace Are kindred to the quiet place, A portion of its magic! VI And there the wild-duck, like a skiff, Shoots from her bower of rushes; His glossy neck enamour'd rears Her mate, and through the screen of spears, Sounding his love charge, brushes. VII The peerly water-heron, too, Where the faint sun-ray trembles, Drooping its ever-graceful head Above the floating lily-bed, A poet-bird resembles. VIII And yonder, on the distant marge, Behold an angler eager, With taper wand and arm of skill, In shadow of the darkening hill, A solitary figure! IX But, falling from the heights beyond, Shadow and mist together, Glideth away the silent showâ The mountain and the lake belowâ The forest and the heather. X And night, with dewy forehead bent, Holdeth its vigil solemn, Till the red architect of morn. Upon a cloud-car slowly born, Erects his amber column! THE INVOCATION. I Oh! waken, winds, waken! the waters are still, And silence and sunlight recline on the hill, The angler is watching beside the green springs For the low welcome sound of your wandering wings. II With rod all appointed, and ready at need, His withe-woven pannier flung down on the mead, He looks to the lake from his ambush of trees, And sighs for the curl of the cool summer breeze. III Calm-bound is the form of the water-fowl fair, And the spear of the rush stands erect in the air; And the dragon-fly roams o'er the lily-bed gay, Where basks the bold pike in a sun-smitten bay. IV Oh! waken, winds, waken! wherever asleep, On cloud or dark mountain, or down in the deep, The angler is watching beside the green springs For the low welcome sound of your wandering wings! SONGâTHE YELLOW FINS OF YARROW. I The yellow fins o' Yarrow dale! I kenna whar they've gane tae; Were ever troots in Border vale Sae comely or sae dainty? II They had baith gowd and spanglit rings, Wi' walth o' pearl amang them; An' for sweet love o' the bonnie things The heart was laith to wrang them. III But he that angles Yarrow ower (Maun changes ever waken?) Frae our Lady's Loch to Newark Tower Will find the stream forsaken. IV Forsaken ilka bank and stane By a' its troots o' splendour; Auld Yarrow's left sae lorn an' lane, Ane scarcely wad ha'e kenn'd her. V Wae's me! the Yarrow yellow fin, I marvel whar he's gane tae! Was ever troot in Forest rin Sae comely or sae dainty? THE OLD WAND. I The wand that hath done service fair From thy boyhood to thy prime, Onwards to thine after-time Cherish. It is worth all care. II Many a fair-spoken friend Hath less friendship in his heart Than this passive piece of art, And will fail thee at the end. III But a trusty rod and tried, Warp'd by service though it be, Toughens in adversity, And clings the nearer to thy side. IV Cherish it for thine own sake, For the record of events Hanging on its accidents. And the memories these awake. V Ferrule bentâdistorted ringâ Top curtail'd or past repairâ The continual wear and tear, And relaxing of its spring; VI Every notch by knife impress'd, Ranging up and down the butt, In its form of cross or rutt, Is to thee of interest. VII In the fortunes of thy wand Thou hast part, no common part, And the beatings of thy heart With its triumphs correspond. VIII Give it place in thine abodeâ In thy dwelling's inner shrineâ In the chamber made divine By love and faith, lay up thy rod. IX When the wielder's arm is weak, And care's fever is at height; In the watches of the night, 'Mid the silence it will speak; X Of the rivers' joys discoursing When the skies are overcast, Making thankful for the past, And a purer life enforcing; XI Whispering with bated breath Of a valley and a stream, Leading to a land of dreamâ The river and the vale of death. XII Symbol be it to fulfil The sweet promises of God,â Symbol of the Staff and Rod Guiding by the waters still! THE DROUGHT OF 1864, HOW IT AFFECTED THE ANGLER. PART I. I The lips of all the springs are dry, And parch'd the throats of every rill; A fiery shape hath scaled the hill With blistering foot and brazen eye. II A fiery shape hath cross'd the lea, And trodden out its summer life, Filling the hags with fetid stife, And staggers onward to the sea. III Within the range of its regard, Drop silenced all the tongues of mirth; Aspiring flowers crouch back to earth, The emeralds of the mead lie charr'd. IV His thirsty tooth the gad-fly whets, Incited by the cruel glare; The spider wrapt in crafty lair Watches the flutter of her nets. V The lizard basks upon the bank; The slow-worm in our pathway crawls; The loathly adder, on the knolls, Lies coil'd among the herbage rank. VI All nature wears an air of spleenâ A cast of languor, not repose, That in the season of the rose Seems alien to her wonted mien. VII Upon the feather'd tribe, the charm Works in a more or less degree; The swallow, which hath cross'd the sea, Within the circuit of the farm VIII Shows flagging wing. The doves retire Below the curtains of the grove, And in the under-tones of love Communicate their one desire. IX With furled canvas, under thatch Of a desponding willow, stands, Like the carved work of cunning hands, The heron keeping weary watch. X The valley's glory broad and bright, Which flash'd with life the May-month long, And with its challenges of song Saluted the starr'd ear of night, XI Has shrunk into a narrow thread, Or, if assuming ampler course, It still affects the river's force, The life and song alike are fled. XII The valley's glory now no more, So straiten'd are its ways and means, So cast the tintsâthe golds and greensâ Which ranged across from shore to shore. XIII So lazily the pulses beat, Which once their merry throb sent out, And stirr'd the hidings of the trout And wing'd the river's twinkling feet, XIV And buoy'd with promises of cheer The angler's heart, like sough of corn, That with the breezes of the morn Comes flowing on the sower's ear. XV Alas! the angler's hopes fall crush'd, Arrested in their radiant flight His aspirations of delight, Their music and persuasion hush'd. XVI The weapon of his prowess lies Neglected. The grey moth invades His feathery stores; the beauty fades From his prospective paradise. XVII And languor, such as reigns without, Enters into his inmost soul, And by its pressure, past control, Puts every longing to the rout. XVIII Even the soft, seducing dawn Allures not with its temper'd hues; Nor yet the shedding of the dews Across the carpet of the lawn; XIX Nor yet the rustling of the trees, The conference of oak with oak, That ushers in the midnight stroke, And predicates the showery breeze. XX A strange, low wind, without an airt, A whispering of leafy sprites, The running to and fro of lights Mysterious, through the forests' heart. XXI Such held their influence till nowâ The wildfire and the Dryad's talk, The steppings in the river's walk, The plumelike beckonings of the bough. XXII But the old faith, which fondly clung To signs and omens, is disturb'd; The tide of superstition curb'd That wander'd betwixt heart and tongue. XXIII Ay! even his wishes lie repell'd By the fierce furnace overhead, Or reach the lips, to die unsaid; So sunk the heart from which they well'd. XXIV Oh! quickly melt, ye skies of brass! Drop, cruel heav'ns, your crystal stores! Open at length the long-barr'd doors, And let the glad libation pass! XXV Relent apace, oh! eye of day That blazing smitest, like a sword Grasp'd by an angel of the Lord, And give the brimming tears their way! XXVI Ye eyes of night! a token bring, Entreat for us, thou Dian chaste! The coursers of the watery waste, And round thee bind thy mystic ring. XXVII The cloud no bigger than a hand, Awaits thy signal in the West, Ready to do thy high behest, And roll salvation o'er the land. XXVIII Oh! welcome rain, oh! welcome rain! Welcome the smile-precursing tearsâ The weeping of the clouds and spheres Which, pass'd, restores to life again, XXIX Freshens the hues of eve and mornâ Dilates the humid orbs of night, And from the treasuries of light Replenishes the lunar horn! XXX I hear it coming in my sleep From cloudland and the vast behind; From the four Castles of the Wind, From the green caverns of the deep. XXXI I hear it coming, as they came That are the messengers of God, And harness'd chariots at his nod,â Horses of cloud to wheels of flame. XXXII The vision that so often pass'd Before me, fraught of longings vainâ The wishes of the heart and brainâ Is surely realized at last! XXXIII Oh! welcome rain, oh! welcome rain! Welcome the quickenings all around The cloud-drift and the moaning sound, The shiftings of the gilded vane! XXXIV The ringings as of liquid bells That break the silence overhead, And hovering o'er the river's bed Set bubbling the enchanted wells. XXXV Hands feebly dropt are raised againâ Tongues loosen'd to make thankful prayerâ Hearts cheer'dâeyes lighten'd everywhere; Oh! welcome rain! oh! welcome rain! PART II. I Oh! angler, thine experience tell, In faulty rhymes, of this fierce drought, How it prevail'd within, without And chain'd thee with its weary spell. II Speak to the reason running wild Of those who waste our valley's wealth, And on the crystal tide of health Cast things defiling and defiled; III Who drain the juices of our land, Reckless of what the need may be To us and to posterity, So that the profit comes to hand. IV Counting but for themselves alone The cost and chances of reward; But taking into no regard The future of the evil done. V How fountains broken up and spiltâ The life-blood driven from the soil, Never to be restored by toilâ Commit to the reward of guilt. VI All honour to the noble art Which into corn transmutes the weed, And turns the waste into the mead,â The alchemy of hand and heart! VII But woe to those who so abuse The license given to scourge and drain, As, in their fell pursuit of gain, All sight of what may come to lose! VIII Who of its fragrance rob the wold, And of its wild-flowers strip the hill; Who check the frolics of the rill, And push it from its courses old; IX To Nature's remnant laying siege, And, under guise of tenant skill, Rake God's own garden with a will, Committing conscious sacrilege. X God speed the honest mill, and feed Its merry spokes by night and day! The rivers as they dance away Repeat the blessing, God it speed! XI The trout within the dam and lead Love the sweet clatter of its wheel, And with its flushings forth reveal Their joy, and bid itâthe God speed; XII But let a malison descend Upon those structures of the day, That with palatial display Shadow our streams at every bend! XIII Those strongholds of monopoly That mar the pictures of the mind, And come betwixt us and the wind, Tainting its natural purity; XIV Which, to allay the thirst of fire That hugs their vitals, and torments, Drink in a valley's whole contents, And sputter out a rush of mire. XV Must this great wrong pass unredress'dâ This rifling of our valley's wealthâ This wanton tampering with health, And no one venture to protest? XVI Shall it go on from bad to worse, Until all remedy is past, And we conniving stand aghast, Partakers of the withering curse? XVII 'Tis the Bard's privilege to foreseeâ His bounden duty to forewarn; Thus prompted, I uplift the horn, And signal the calamity. XVIII The cry for corn was late abroadâ The cry for cheap, untrammell'd bread;â For the big quartern blood was shed, And the great cry went up to God! XIX That cry hath ceased; but in its place Threatens to come the fiercer cry, Give us pure water else we die, And, dying, curse you to the face! XX Arrest the evil while you may, Nor pause to argue, on the plea That to advance utility Is the first duty of the day,â XXI That interests where selfish strife Goes hand in hand with factory pride, Admit of claims which set aside The grave necessities of life. XXII With air and fire at their control, And the electric power divine, Why trespass on the Naiad's shrine These taskers of the hand and soul? XXIII Forbid it, ye strong powers that be! Arrest the evil while you can, And let not the Leviathan Swallow the tribute of the sea. XXIV Its rivers are a nation's trustâ The people's dearest heritage, Which it is bound from age to age To hold inviolate from lust; XXV With jealousy the fountain-heads To fend against all reckless waste; Nor suffer elements unchaste To dim the diamond of their beds. XXVI Up and be busy, ye to whom This sacred duty appertains! Our rivers rescue from their chains, And snatch from their impending doom. XXVII No weary drought will vex them then, No fiery shape invade the lea; But salmon riches crowd the sea, And roll up to our doors again. XXVIII The mill and farm will thrive apace, And with them peer and peasant both; Only repel the Hun and Goth, And meet the Vandal face to face. THE OTTER. I A jolly life the otter leads That lurks by Eden Water; He has nothing to do but frisk about And take his pick of the eels and trout That revel at dusk among the weeds,â The dainty old thief of an otter! II Below the mill at Stichel Linn, I met the miller's daughter; Her cheek it was pallid with affright; But when she told me of a sprite With rounding eye and demon grin, I recognised the otter. III Now hie thee home, my timid girl, And dream away thy flutter! We'll up betimes the morrow's morn, Before the throstle heads the thorn, Or from its nest the joking squirrel Plays bo-peep with the otter. IV We'll up betimes at break of day, With hounds well versed in slaughter,â As fleet and musical a pack As ever cross'd the valley's track, And splash'd and dash'd, from bank to brae, A-hunting of the otter. V Old Druid, he's the boy to find, And as the scent grows hotter, With chiming tongue and steaming pace Keep up the spirit of the chase; No abler header of the wind Ere grappled with Sir Otter! VI Young Spurgy to old Druid's bell Responds with swatter, swotter; Shaking his jowls in grim delight, And sniffing up with all his might, Among the perfumes of the dell, The fragrance of the otter. VII We'll bring to bear the Grip and Gurl Against the crafty plotter; The âwee bit birkies,â Flam and Flor, Will no' be hindmost in the splore, And snarling Bob, the mongrel churl, His teeth show to the otter. VIII Oh! little recks the oily thief That harries a' our waters, Of what may be his morrow's fare, Who goes a-prowling, here or there, And how may come to sudden grief The jolliest of otters! EPIGRAM. [Teviot a river is that lives by Rule] Teviot a river is that lives by Rule, And scorns all guidance from your sage Ulysses; But takes its ruddy Ale before its Kale, And with a merry mouth fair Anna kisses. SONNET. Irregular. Another gathering from the days gone by! Another re-assembling by the stream Of dear old formsâa grand fraternity! What noble presences invest my dream! Parents of deeds renowning and renown'dâ The wrestlers that in art and song o'ercame, And help'd to raise our country to its fame! The muse of memory stands on hallow'd ground, And in performance of a solemn rite, When to the trysting-place of old regard, Which cons the river in its varied flight, (A wooded knoll with undergrowth of sward,) She summons round her all the shades of worthâ Companions in the sport which lightens toilâ The hundred-gifted champions of the North, Who with their increment of boisterous health Drawn from unstinted use of heaven's pure air, Heighten'd the lustre of the midnight oil, And gave to life new thoughts and fancies rareâ Standard accessions to our famed book wealth!</field>
