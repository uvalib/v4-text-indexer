      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. FINGAL, AN EPIC POEM; IN SIX BOOKS. Fortia facta patrum. Virg. ARGUMENT TO BOOK I. Cuthullin, (general of the Irish tribes, in the minority of Cormac, king of Ireland) sitting alone beneath a tree, at the gate of Tura, a castle of Ulster (the other chiefs having gone on a hunting party to Cromla, a neighbouring hill), is informed of the landing of Swaran, king of Lochlin, by Moran, the son of Fithil, one of his scouts. He convenes the chiefs; a council is held, and disputes run high, about giving battle to the enemy. Connal, the petty king of Togorma, and an intimate friend of Cuthullin, was for retreating till Fingal, king of those Caledonians who inhabited the north-west coast of Scotland, whose aid had been previously solicited, should arrive; but Calmar, the son of Matha, lord of Lara, a country in Connaught, was for engaging the enemy immediately. Cuthullin, of himself willing to fight, went into the opinion of Calmar. Marching towards the enemy, he missed three of his bravest heroes, Fergus, Duchomar, and Cathba. Fergus arriving, tells Cuthullin of the death of the other two chiefs; which introduces the affecting episode of Morna, the daughter of Cormac. The army of Cuthullin is descried at a distance by Swaran, who sent the son of Arno to observe the motions of the enemy, while he himself ranged his forces in order of battle. The son of Arno, returning to Swaran, describes to him Cuthullin's chariot, and the terrible appearance of that hero. The armies engage, but night coming on, leaves the victory undecided. Cuthullin, according to the hospitality of the times, sends to Swaran a formal invitation to a feast, by his bard Carril, the son of Kinfena. Swaran refuses to come. Carril relates to Cuthullin the story of Grudar and Brassolis. A party, by Connal's advice, is sent to observe the enemy; which closes the action of the first day. Macpherson. The opening of Fingal adheres strictly to the Horatian precept; Semper ad eventum festinat; et in medias res, Non secus ac notas, auditorem rapit: which Blair, with an evasive simplicity, terms a most happy coincidence of thought. But the supposed translator maintains, that “there are certain general rules in the conduct of an epic poem, which, as they are natural, are therefore universal; and in these the two poets (Homer and Ossian) exactly correspond.” —Temora, viii. Note. As a siege, or voyage, of ten years duration, was incompatible with an epic poem, intended for public recitation, Homer himself was reduced to the necessity of selecting the most important event for the Iliad, and the most important period of the voyage for the Odyssey; in which last alone, the narrative of preceding transactions is introduced, as an episode. Succeeding epic poets, from Virgil to Milton, have adopted the same rule from imitation, and begin invariably in the midst of things. That the rule itself is neither universal nor obviously natural, appears from the opposite conduct, not only of the Cyclic poets, and of every rhyming chronicler in the dark ages, but of Apollonius Rhodius, who adheres to the regular course of events, and of Ariosto and Spenser, who, neglecting Homer, pursue some fantastical plan of their own. Trissino and Tasso were the first moderns who revived the classical model of epic poetry, the chief excellence of which is, not that it is natural or obvious, and therefore universal, but that it is the best, and most artificial arrangement which it is possible to conceive. The arrangement most natural and obvious, perhaps, to the genuine Ossian, if not the origin of the war with Swaran, of which we are still ignorant, was Cuthullin's application to Fingal for aid; the voyage of the latter to Ireland; his arrival there on the defeat of his friends; in short, the transactions which the poet himself had witnessed, not those of which he had heard from others. But the supposed translator, to whom, in arranging his “brief Epic,” all parts of the poem were equally present, begins abruptly in the middle, with Cuthullin reclined under Tura's wall; and invokes no muse, because, says Blair, he acknowledges none. He invokes no muse in the Highlander, which, if the first six lines were retrenched, would begin abruptly like Fingal, without any formal introduction of the subject; and, “The man I sing,” the common exordium of epic poems, would have betrayed as plain imitation as the invocation of a muse. BOOK I. Cuthullin sat by Tura's wall Cuthullin sat by Tura's wall: by the tree of the rustling sound. His spear leaned against a rock. His shield lay on grass, by his side. Amid his thoughts of mighty Carbar, a hero slain by the chief in war; the scout of ocean comes, Moran, the son of Fithil! “Arise,” says the youth,” “Cuthullin, arise, I see the ships of the north! Many, chief of men, are the foe. Many the heroes of the seaborne Swaran!” “Moran,” replied the blue-eyed chief, “thou ever tremblest, son of Fithil! Thy fears have increased the foe. It is Fingal, king of desarts, with aid to green Erin of streams.” “I beheld their chief,” says Moran, “tall as a glittering rock. His spear is a blasted pine. His shield the rising moon! He sat on the shore! like a cloud of mist on the silent hill! Many, chief of heroes! I said, many are our hands of war. Well art thou named, the Mighty Man: but many mighty men are seen from Tura's windy walls. “He spoke, like a wave on a rock, Who in this land appears like me? Heroes stand not in my presence: they fall to earth from my hand. Who can meet Swaran in fight? Who but Fingal, king of Selma of storms? Once we wrestled on Malmor; our heels overturned the woods. Rocks fell from their place; rivulets, changing their course, fled murmuring from our side. Three days we renewed our strife; heroes stood at a distance and trembled. On the fourth, Fingal says, that the king of the ocean fell! but Swaran says, he stood! Let dark Cuthullin yield to him, that is strong as the storms of his land!” “No!” replied the blue-eyed chief, “I never yield to mortal man! Dark Cuthullin shall be great or dead! Go, son of Fithil, take my spear. Strike the sounding shield of Semo. It hangs at Tura's rustling gate. The sound of peace is not its voice! My heroes shall hear and obey.” He went. He struck the bossy shield. The hills, the rocks reply. The sound spreads along the wood: deer start by the lake of roes. Curach leaps from the sounding rock; and Connal of the bloody spear! Crugal's breast of snow beats high. The son of Favi leaves the dark-brown hind. It is the shield of war, said Ronnar! the spear of Cuthullin, said Lugar! Son of the sea, put on thy arms! Calmer, lift thy sounding steel! Puno! dreadful hero, arise! Cairbar, from thy red tree of Cromla! Bend thy knee, O Eth; descend from the streams of Lena. Ca-olt, stretch thy side as thou movest along the whistling heath of Mora: thy side that is white as the foam of the troubled sea, when the dark winds pour it on rocky Cuthon. Now I behold the chiefs, in the pride of their former deeds! Their souls are kindled at the battles of old; at the actions of other times. Their eyes are flames of fire. They roll in search of the foes of the land. Their mighty hands are on their swords. Lightning pours from their sides of steel. They come like streams from the mountains; each rushes roaring from his hill. Bright are the chiefs of battle, in the armour of their fathers. Gloomy and dark their heroes follow, like the gathering of the rainy clouds behind the red meteors of heaven. The sounds of crashing arms ascend. The grey dogs howl between. Unequal bursts the song of battle. Rocking Cromla echoes round. On Lena's dusky heath they stand, like mist that shades the hills of autumn; when broken and dark it settles high, and lifts its head to heaven. “Hail,” said Cuthullin, “sons of the narrow vales! hail, hunters of the deer! Another sport is drawing near: It is like the dark rolling of that wave on the coast! Or shall we fight, ye sons of war! or yield green Erin to Lochlin! O Connal, speak, thou first of men! thou breaker of the shields! thou hast often fought with Lochlin: wilt thou lift thy father's spear?” “Cuthullin!” calm the chief replied, “the spear of Connal is keen. It delights to shine in battle; to mix with the blood of thousands. But though my hand is bent on fight, my heart is for the peace of Erin. Behold, thou first in Cormac's war, the sable fleet of Swaran. His masts are many on our coast, like reeds in the lake of Lego. His ships are forests cloathed with mist, when the trees yield by turns to the squally wind. Many are his chiefs in battle. Connal is for peace! Fingal would shun his arm, the first of mortal men! Fingal, who scatters the mighty, as stormy winds the heath; when streams roar through echoing Cona; and night settles with all her clouds on the hill!” “Fly, thou man of peace,” said Calmar, “fly,” said the son of Matha; “go, Connal, to thy silent hills, where the spear never brightens in war! Pursue the dark-brown deer of Cromla: stop with thine arrows the bounding roes of Lena. But, blue-eyed son of Semo, Cuthullin, ruler of the field, scatter thou the sons of Lochlin; roar through the ranks of their pride. Let no vessel of the kingdom of Snow, bound on the dark-rolling waves of Inistore. Rise, ye dark winds of Erin, rise! roar, whirlwinds of Lara of hinds! Amid the tempest let me die, torn, in a cloud, by angry ghosts of men: amid the tempest let Calmar die, if ever chace was sport to him, so much as the battle of shields!” “Calmar!” Connal slow replied, “I never fled, young son of Matha! I was swift with my friends in fight; but small is the fame of Connal! The battle was won in my presence; the valiant overcame! But, son of Semo, hear my voice, regard the antient throne of Cormac. Give wealth and half the land for peace, till Fingal shall arrive on our coast. Or, if war be thy choice, I lift the sword and spear. My joy shall be in the midst of thousands; my soul shall lighten through the gloom of the fight!” “To me,” Cuthullin replies, “pleasant is the noise of arms! pleasant as the thunder of heaven, before the shower of spring! But gather all the shining tribes, that I may view the sons of war! Let them pass along the heath, bright as the sun-shine before a storm; when the west wind collects the clouds, and Morven echoes over all her oaks! But where are my friends in battle? The supporters of my arm in danger? Where art thou, white-bosom'd Cathbar? Where is that cloud in war Duchomar? Hast thou left me, O Fergus! in the day of the storm? Fergus, first in our joy at the feast! son of Rossa! arm of death! comest thou like a roe from Malmor? like a hart from thy echoing hills? Hail thou son of Rossa! what shades the soul of war?” “Four stones,” replied the chief, “rise on the grave of Cathba. These hands have laid in earth Duchomar, that cloud in war! Cathba, son of Torman! thou wert a sun-beam in Erin. And thou, O valiant Duchomar, a mist of the marshy Lano; when it moves on the plains of autumn, bearing the death of thousands along. Morna! fairest of maids! calm is thy sleep in the cave of the rock! Thou hast fallen in darkness, like a star, that shoots across the desart; when the traveller is alone, and mourns the transient beam!” “Say,” said Semo's blue-eyed son, “say, how fell the chiefs of Erin? Fell they by the sons of Lochlin, striving in the battle of heroes? Or what confines the strong in arms to the dark and narrow house?” “Cathba,” replied the hero, “fell by the sword of Duchomar, at the oak of the noisy streams. Duchomar came to Tura's cave; he spoke to the lovely Morna. Morna, fairest among women, lovely daughter of strong-armed Cormac! Why in the circle of stones? in the cave of the rock alone? The stream murmurs along. The old tree groans in the wind. The lake is troubled before thee; dark are the clouds of the sky! But thou art snow on the heath; thy hair is the mist of Cromla; when it curls on the hill; when it shines to the beam of the west! Thy breasts are two smooth rocks seen from Branno of streams. Thy arms like two white pillars, in the halls of the great Fingal. “From whence,” the fair-haired maid replied, “from whence, Duchomar, most gloomy of men? Dark are thy brows and terrible! Red are thy rolling eyes! Does Swaran appear on the sea? What of the foe, Duchomar?” “From the hill I return, O Morna, from the hill of the dark-brown hinds. Three have I slain with my bended yew. Three with my long bounding dogs of the chace. Lovely daughter of Cormac, I love thee as my soul! I have slain one stately deer for thee. High was his branchy head; and fleet his feet of wind.” “Duchomar!” calm the maid replied, “I love thee not, thou gloomy man! hard is thy heart of rock; dark is thy terrible brow. But Cathba, young son of Torman, thou art the love of Morna. Thou art a sun-beam, in the day of the gloomy storm. Sawest thou the son of Torman, lovely on the hill of his hinds? Here the daughter of Cormac waits the coming of Cathba!” “Long shall Morna wait,” Duchomar said, “long shall Morna wait for Cathba! Behold this sword unsheathed! Here wanders the blood of Cathba. Long shall Morna wait. He fell by the stream of Branno! On Cromla I will raise his tomb, daughter of blue-shielded Cormac! Turn on Duchomar thine eyes; his arm is strong as a storm.” “Is the son of Torman fallen?” said the wildly-bursting voice of the maid. “Is he fallen on his echoing hills, the youth with the breast of snow? The first in the chace of hinds? The foe of the strangers of ocean? Thou art dark to me, Duchomar, cruel is thine arm to Morna! Give me that sword, my foe! I love the wandering blood of Cathba!” He gave the sword to her tears. She pierced his manly breast! He fell, like the bank of a mountain stream, and stretching forth his hand he spoke. “Daughter of blue-shielded Cormac! Thou hast slain me in youth! The sword is cold in my breast: Morna, I feel it cold. Give me to Moina, the maid. Duchomar was the dream of her night! She will raise my tomb; the hunter shall raise my fame. But draw the sword from my breast. Morna, the steel is cold!” She came, in all her tears, she came; she drew the sword from his breast. He pierced her white side! He spread her fair locks on the ground! Her bursting blood sounds from her side: her white arm is stained with red. Rolling in death she lay. The cave re-echoed to her sighs.” “Peace,” said Cuthullin, “to the souls of the heroes! their deeds were great in fight. Let them ride around me on clouds. Let them shew their features of war. My soul shall then be firm in danger; mine arm, like the thunder of heaven! But be thou on a moon-beam, O Morna! near the window of my rest; when my thoughts are of peace; when the din of arms is past. Gather the strength of the tribes! Move to the wars of Erin! Attend the car of my battles! Rejoice in the noise of my course! Place three spears by my side: follow the bounding of my steeds! That my soul may be strong in my friends, when battle darkens round the beams of my steel!” As rushes a stream of foam from the dark shady steep of Cromla; when the thunder is travelling above, and dark brown night sits on half the hill. Through the breaches of the tempest look forth the dim faces of ghosts. So fierce, so vast, so terrible, rushed on the sons of Erin. The chief, like a whale of ocean, whom all his billows pursue, poured valour forth, as a stream, rolling his might along the shore. The sons of Lochlin heard the noise, as the sound of a winter storm. Swaran struck his bossy shield: he called the son of Arno. “What murmur rolls along the hill, like the gathered flies of the eve? The sons of Erin descend, or rustling winds roar in the distant wood! Such is the noise of Gormal, before the white tops of my waves arise. O son of Arno, ascend the hill; view the dark face of the heath!” He went. He trembling, swift returned. His eyes rolled wildly round. His heart beat high against his side. His words were faultering, broken, slow. “Arise, son of ocean, arise, chief of the dark brown shields! I see the dark, the mountain-stream of battle! The deep-moving strength of the sons of Erin! The car, the car of war comes on, like the flame of death! the rapid car of Cuthullin, the noble son of Semo! It bends behind, like a wave near a rock; like the sun-streaked mist of the heath. Its sides are embossed with stones, and sparkle like the sea round the boat of night. Of polished yew is its beam; its seat of the smoothest bone. The sides are replenished with spears; the bottom is the foot-stool of heroes! Before the right side of the car is seen the snorting horse! The high-maned, broad-breasted, proud, wide-leaping, strong steed of the hill. Loud and resounding is his hoof; the spreading of his mane above, is like a stream of smoke on a ridge of rocks. Bright are the sides of the steed! his name is Sulin-Sifadda! “Before the left side of the car is seen the snorting horse! The thin-maned, high-headed, strong-hoofed, fleet, bounding son of the hill: his name is Dusronnal, among the stormy sons of the sword! A thousand thongs bind the car on high. Hard polished bits shine in a wreath of foam. Thin thongs bright-studded with gems, bend on the stately necks of the steeds. The steeds, that like wreaths of mist fly over the streamy vales! The wildness of deer is in their course, the strength of eagles descending on the prey. Their noise is like the blast of winter, on the sides of the snow-headed Gormal. “Within the car is seen the chief; the strong-armed son of the sword. The hero's name is Cuthullin, son of Semo, king of shells. His red cheek is like my polished yew. The look of his blue-rolling eye is wide, beneath the dark arch of his brow. His hair flies from his head like a flame, as bending forward, he wields the spear. Fly, king of ocean, fly! He comes, like a storm, along the streamy vale!” “When did I fly,” replied the king? “When fled Swaran from the battle of spears? When did I shrink from danger, chief of the little soul? I met the storm of Gormal, when the foam of my waves beat high. I met the storm of the clouds; shall Swaran fly from a hero? Were Fingal himself before me, my soul should not darken with fear. Arise to battle, my thousands! pour round me like the echoing main. Gather round the bright steel of your king; strong as the rocks of my land; that meet the storm, with joy, and stretch their dark pines to the wind!” Like autumn's dark storms, pouring from two echoing hills, toward each other approached the heroes. Like two deep streams from high rocks meeting, mixing, roaring, on the plain; loud, rough, and dark in battle, meet Lochlin and Innis-fail. Chief mixes his strokes with chief, and man with man; steel, clanging, sounds on steel. Helmets are cleft on high. Blood bursts and smokes around. Strings murmur on the polished yews. Darts rush along the sky. Spears fall like the circles of light, which gild the face of night. As the noise of the troubled ocean, when roll the waves on high. As the last peal of thunder in heaven, such is the din of war! Though Cormac's hundred bards were there, to give the fight to song; feeble was the voice of a hundred bards, to send the deaths to future times! For many were the deaths of heroes; wide poured the blood of the brave! Mourn, ye sons of song, mourn the death of the noble Sithallin. Let the sighs of Fiona rise, on the lone plains of her lovely Ardan. They fell, like two hinds of the desart, by the hands of the mighty Swaran; when, in the midst of thousands, he roared; like the shrill spirit of a storm. He sits dim, on the clouds of the north, and enjoys the death of the mariner. Nor slept thy hand by thy side, chief of the isle of mist! Many were the deaths of thine arm, Cuthullin, thou son of Semo! His sword was like the beam of heaven when it pierces the sons of the vale; when the people are blasted and fall, and all the hills are burning around. Dusronnel snorted over the bodies of heroes. Sifadda bathed his hoof in blood. The battle lay behind him, as groves overturned on the desart of Cromla; when the blast has passed the heath, laden with the spirits of night! Weep on the rocks of roaring winds, O maid of Inistore! Bend thy fair head over the waves, thou lovelier than the ghost of the hills; when it moves, in a sun-beam, at noon, over the silence of Morven! He is fallen! thy youth is low! pale beneath the sword of Cuthullin! No more shall valour raise thy love to match the lood of kings. Trenar, graceful Trenar died, O maid of Inistore! His grey dogs are howling at home; they see his passing ghost. His bow is in the hall unstrung. No sound is in the hill of his hinds! As roll a thousand waves to the rocks, so Swaran's host came on. As meets a rock a thousand waves, so Erin met Swaran of spears. Death raises all his voices around, and mixes with the sounds of shields. Each hero is a pillar of darkness; the sword a beam of fire in his hand. The field echoes from wing to wing, as a hundred hammers that rise, by turns, on the red son of the furnace. Who are these on Lena's heath, these so gloomy and dark? Who are these like two clouds, and their swords like lightening above them! The little hills are troubled around; the rocks tremble with all their moss. Who is it but Ocean's son and the car-borne chief of Erin? Many are the anxious eyes of their friends, as they see them dim on the heath. But night conceals the chiefs in clouds, and ends the dreadful fight! It was on Cromla's shaggy side that Dorglas had placed the deer; the early fortune of the chace, before the heroes left the hill. A hundred youths collect the heath; ten warriors wake the fire; three hundred chuse the polish'd stones. The feast is smoking wide! Cuthullin, chief of Erin's war, resumed his mighty soul. He stood upon his beamy spear, and spoke to the son of songs; to Carril of other times, the grey-haired son of Kinfena. “Is this feast spread for me alone, and the king of Lochlin on Erin's shore; far from the deer of his hills, and sounding halls of his feasts? Rise, Carril of other times; carry my words to Swaran. Tell him from the roaring of waters, that Cuthullin gives his feast. Here let him listen to the sound of my groves, amidst the clouds of night. For cold and bleak the blustering winds rush over the foam of his seas. Here let him praise the trembling harp, and hear the songs of heroes!” Old Carril went, with softest voice. He called the king of dark-brown shields! “Rise from the skins of thy chace, rise, Swaran, king of groves! Cuthullin gives the joy of shells. Partake the feast of Erin's blue-eyed chief!” He answered like the sullen sound of Cromla before a storm. “Though all thy daughters, Inisfail! should stretch their arms of snow; should raise the heavings of their breasts, and softly roll their eyes of love; yet, fixed as Lochlin's thousand rocks, here Swaran should remain; till morn, with the young beams of the east, shall light me to the death of Cuthullin. Pleasant to my ear is Lochlin's wind! It rushes over my seas! It speaks aloft in all my shrouds, and brings my green forests to my mind: The green forests of Gormal, which often echoed to my winds, when my spear was red in the chace of the boar. Let dark Cuthullin yield to me the ancient throne of Cormac; or Erin's torrents shall shew from their hills, the red foam of the blood of his pride!” “Sad is the sound of Swaran's voice,” said Carril of other times! “Sad to himself alone,” said the blue-eyed son of Semo. “But, Carril, raise the voice on high; tell the deeds of other times. Send thou the night away in song; and give the joy of grief. For many heroes and maids of love, have moved on Inis-fail: And lovely are the songs of woe, that are heard in Albion's rocks; when the noise of the chace is past, and the streams of Cona answer to the voice of Ossian.” “In other days,” Carril replies, “came the sons of Ossian to Erin! A thousand vessels bounded on waves to Ullin's lovely plains. The sons of Inis-fail arose, to meet the race of dark-brown shields. Cairbar, first of men, was there, and Grudar, stately youth! Long had they strove for the spotted bull, that lowed on Golbun's echoing heath. Each claimed him as his own. Death was often at the point of their steel! side by side the heroes fought; the strangers of Ocean fled. Whose name was fairer on the hill, than the name of Cairbar and Grudar! But ah! why ever lowed the bull, on Golbon's echoing heath! They saw him leaping like snow. The wrath of the chiefs returned! “On Lubar's grassy banks they fought; Grudar fell in his blood. Fierce Cairbar came to the vale, where Brassolis, fairest of his sisters, all alone, raised the song of grief. She sung of the actions of Grudar, the youth of her secret soul! She mourned him in the field of blood; but still she hoped for his return. Her white bosom is seen from her robe, as the moon from the clouds of night, when its edge heaves white on the view, from the darkness, which covers its orb. Her voice was softer than the harp to raise the song of grief. Her soul was fixed on Grudar. The secret look of her eye was his. “When shalt thou come in thine arms, thou mighty in the war?” “Take, Brassolis,” Cairbar came and said, “take, Brassolis, this shield of blood. Fix it on high within my hall, the armour of my foe!” Her soft heart beat against her side. Distracted, pale, she flew. She found her youth in all his blood; she died on Cromla's heath. Here rests their dust, Cuthullin, these lonely yews sprung from their tombs, and shade them from the storm. Fair was Brassolis on the plain! Stately was Grudar on the hill! The bard shall preserve their names, and send them down to future times!” “Pleasant is thy voice, O Carril,” said the blue-eyed chief of Erin. “Pleasant are the words of other times! They are like the calm shower of spring; when the sun looks on the field, and the light cloud flies over the hills. O strike the harp in praise of my love! the lonely sun-beam of Dunscaith. Strike the harp in the praise of Bragela; she that I left in the Isle of Mist, the spouse of Semo's son! Dost thou raise thy fair face from the rock, to find the sails of Cuthullin? The sea is rolling distant far; its white foam deceives thee for my sails. Retire, for it is night, my love; the dark winds sing in thy hair. Retire to the halls of my feasts; think of the times that are past. I will not return till the storm of war is ceased. O Connal! speak of war and arms, and send her from my mind. Lovely, with her flowing hair, is the white-bosomed daughter of Sorglan.” Connal, slow to speak, replied, “Guard against the race of Ocean. Send thy troop of night abroad, and watch the strength of Swaran. Cuthullin! I am for peace, till the race of Selma come; till Fingal come, the first of men, and beam, like the sun, on our fields!” The hero struck the shield of alarms, the warriors of the night moved on! The rest lay in the heath of the deer, and slept beneath the dusky wind. The ghosts of the lately dead were near, and swam on the gloomy clouds: and far distant, in the dark silence of Lena, the feeble voices of death were faintly heard. BOOK II. ARGUMENT TO BOOK II. The ghost of Crugal, one of the Irish heroes who was killed in battle, appearing to Connal, foretells the defeat of Cuthullin in the next battle; and earnestly advises him to make peace with Swaran. Connal communicates the vision; but Cuthullin is inflexible; from a principle of honour, he would not be the first to sue for peace, and he resolved to continue the war. Morning comes; Swaran proposes dishonourable terms to Cuthullin, which are rejected. The battle begins, and is obstinately fought for some time, until, upon the flight of Grumal, the whole Irish army gave way. Cuthullin and Connal cover their retreat: Carril leads them to a neighbouring hill, whither they are soon followed by Cuthullin himself, who descries the fleet of Fingal making towards the coast; but night coming on, he lost sight of it again. Cuthullin, dejected after his defeat, attributes his ill success to the death of Ferda, his friend, whom he had killed some time before. Carril, to shew that ill success did not always attend those who innocently killed their friends, introduces the episode of Comal and Galvina. Macpherson. Connal lay by the sound of the mountain stream, beneath the aged tree. A stone, with its moss, supported his head. Shrill through the heath of Lena, he heard the voice of night. At distance from the heroes he lay; the son of the sword feared no foe! The hero beheld, in his rest, a dark-red stream of fire rushing down from the hill. Crugal sat upon the beam, a chief who fell in fight. He fell by the hand of Swaran, striving in the battle of heroes. His face is like the beam of the setting moon. His robes are of the clouds of the hill. His eyes are two decaying flames! Dark is the wound of his breast! “Crugal,” said the mighty Connal, “son of Dedgal famed on the hill of hinds! Why so pale and sad, thou breaker of the shields? Thou hast never been pale for fear! What disturbs the departed Crugal?” Dim, and in tears, he stood, and stretched his pale hand over the hero. Faintly he raised his feeble voice, like the gale of the reedy Lego! “My spirit, Connal, is on my hills: my corse on the sands of Erin. Thou shalt never talk with Crugal, nor find his lone steps in the heath. I am light as the blast of Cromla. I move like the shadow of mist! Connal, son of Colgar, I see a cloud of death: it hovers dark over the plains of Lena. The sons of green Erin must fall. Remove from the field of ghosts.” Like the darkened moon he retired, in the midst of the whistling blast. “Stay,” said the mighty Connal, “stay, my dark-red friend. Lay by that beam of heaven, son of the windy Cromla! What cave is thy lonely house? What green-headed hill the place of thy repose? Shall we not hear thee in the storm? In the noise of the mountain-stream? When the feeble sons of the wind come forth, and, scarcely seen, pass over the desert?” The soft-voiced Connal rose, in the midst of his sounding arms. He struck his shield above Cuthullin. The son of battle waked. “Why,” said the ruler of the car, “comes Connal through my night? My spear might turn against the sound; and Cuthullin mourn the death of his friend. Speak, Connal; son of Colgar, speak, thy council is the sun of heaven!” “Son of Semo!” replied the chief, “the ghost of Crugal came from his cave. The stars dim-twinkled through his form. His voice was like the sound of a distant stream. He is a messenger of death! He speaks of the dark and narrow house! Sue for peace, O chief of Erin! or fly over the heath of Lena.” “He spoke to Connal,” replied the hero, “though stars dim-twinkled through his form! Son of Colgar, it was the wind that murmured across thy ear. Or if it was the form of Crugal, why didst thou not force him to my sight? Hast thou enquired where is his cave? The house of that son of wind? My sword might find that voice, and force his knowledge from Crugal. But small is his knowledge, Connal; he was here to-day. He could not have gone beyond our hills! who could tell him there of our fall?” “Ghosts fly on clouds, and ride on winds,” said Connal's voice of wisdom. “They rest together in their caves, and talk of mortal men.” “Then let them talk of mortal men; of every man but Erin's chief. Let me be forgot in their cave. I will not fly from Swaran! If fall I must, my tomb shall rise, amidst the fame of future times. The hunter shall shed a tear on my stone; sorrow shall dwell round the high-bosomed Bragèla. I fear not death, to fly I fear! Fingal has seen me victorious! Thou dim phantom of the hill, shew thyself to me! come on thy beam of heaven, shew me my death in thine hand; yet I will not fly, thou feeble son of the wind! Go, son of Colgar, strike the shield. It hangs between the spears. Let my warriors rise to the sound, in the midst of the battles of Erin. Though Fingal delays his coming with the race of the stormy isles; we shall fight, O Colgar's son, and die in the battle of heroes!” The sound spreads wide. The heroes rise, like the breaking of a blue-rolling wave. They stood on the heath, like oaks, with all their branches round them; when they echo to the stream of frost, and their withered leaves are rustling to the wind! High Cromla's head of clouds is grey. Morning trembles on the half-enlightened ocean. The blue mist swims slowly by, and hides the sons of Inis-fail! “Rise ye,” said the king of the dark-brown shields, “ye that came from Lochlin's waves. The sons of Erin have fled from our arms; pursue them over the plains of Lena! Morla, go to Cormac's hall. Bid them yield to Swaran; before his people sink to the tomb; and silence spread over his isle.” They rose, rustling like a flock of sea-fowl, when the waves expel them from the shore. Their sound was like a thousand streams that meet in Cona's vale, when, after a stormy night, they turn their dark eddies beneath the pale light of the morn. As the dark shades of autumn fly over the hills of grass, so gloomy, dark, successive came the chiefs of Lochlin's echoing woods. Tall as the stag of Morven, moved stately before them, the king. His shining shield is on his side, like a flame on the heath at night. When the world is silent and dark, and the traveller sees some ghost sporting in the beam! Dimly gleam the hills around, and shew indistinctly their oaks! A blast from the troubled ocean, removed the settled mist. The sons of Erin appear, like a ridge of rocks on the coast; when mariners on shores unknown, are trembling at veering winds! “Go, Morla, go,” said the king of Lochlin, “offer peace to these! Offer the terms we give to kings, when nations bow down to our swords. When the valiant are dead in war; when virgins weep on the field!” Tall Morla came, the son of Swarth, and stately strode the youth along! He spoke to Erin's blue-eyed chief, among the lesser heroes. “Take Swaran's peace,” the warrior spoke, “the peace he gives to kings, when nations bow to his sword. Leave Erin's streamy plains to us, and give thy spouse and dog. Thy spouse high-bosomed, heaving fair! Thy dog that overtakes the wind! Give these to prove the weakness of thine arm; live then beneath our power!” “Tell Swaran, tell that heart of pride, Cuthullin never yields. I give him the dark-rolling sea; I give his people graves in Erin. But never shall a stranger have the pleasing sunbeam of my love. No deer shall fly on Lochlin's hills, before swift-footed Luath.” “Vain ruler of the car,” said Morla, “wilt thou then fight the king? The king, whose ships of many groves could carry off thine isle? So little is thy greenhilled Erin to him who rules the stormy waves!” “In words I yield to many, Morla. My sword shall yield to none. Erin shall own the sway of Cormac, while Connal and Cuthullin live! O Connal, first of mighty men, thou hearest the words of Morla. Shall thy thoughts then be of peace, thou breaker of the shields? Spirit of fallen Crugal! why didst thou threaten us with death? The narrow house shall receive me, in the midst of the light of renown. Exalt, ye sons of Erin, exalt the spear and bend the bow: rush on the foe in darkness, as the spirits of stormy nights!” Then dismal, roaring, fierce, and deep, the gloom of battle poured along; as mist that is rolled on a valley, when storms invade the silent sun-shine of heaven! Cuthullin moves before, in arms, like an angry ghost before a cloud; when meteors inclose him with fire; when the dark winds are in his hand. Carril, far on the heath, bids the horn of battle sound. He raises the voice of song, and pours his soul into the minds of the brave. “Where,” said the mouth of the song, “where is the fallen Crugal? He lies forgot on earth; the hall of shells is silent. Sad is the spouse of Crugal! She is a stranger in the hall of her grief. But who is she, that, like a sun-beam, flies before the ranks of the foe? It is Degrena, lovely fair, the spouse of fallen Crugal. Her hair is on the wind behind. Her eye is red; her voice is shrill. Pale, empty is thy Crugal now! His form is in the cave of the hill. He comes to the ear of rest; he raises his feeble voice; like the humming of the mountain-bee; like the collected flies of the eve! But Degrena falls like a cloud of the morn; the sword of Lochlin is in her side. Cairbar, she is fallen, the rising thought of thy youth. She is fallen, O Cairbar, the thought of thy youthful hours!” Fierce Cairbar heard the mournful sound. He rushed along like ocean's whale. He saw the death of his daughter: He roared in the midst of thousands. His spear met a son of Lochlin; battle spreads from wing to wing! As a hundred winds in Lochlin's groves; as fire in the pines of a hundred hills; so loud, so ruinous, so vast the ranks of men are hewn down. Cuthullin cut off heroes like thistles; Swaran wasted Erin. Curach fell by his hand, Cairbar of the bossy shield! Morglan lies in lasting rest! Ca-olt trembles as he dies! His white breast is stained with blood; his yellow hair stretched in the dust of his native land! He often had spread the feast where he fell. He often there had raised the voice of the harp: when his dogs leapt around for joy, and the youths of the chace prepared the bow! Still Swaran advanced, as a stream, that bursts from the desart. The little hills are rolled in its course; the rocks are half sunk by its side! But Cuthullin stood before him, like a hill that catches the clouds of heaven. The winds contend on its head of pines; the hail rattles on its rocks. But, firm in its strength, it stands, and shades the silent vale of Cona! So Cuthullin shaded the sons of Erin, and stood in the midst of thousands. Blood rises like the fount of a rock, from panting heroes around. But Erin falls on either wing, like snow in the day of the sun. “O sons of Erin,” said Grumal, “Lochlin conquers on the field. Why strive we as reeds against the wind? Fly to the hill of dark-brown hinds.” He fled like the stag of Morven; his spear is a trembling beam of light behind him. Few fled with Grumal, chief of the little soul: they fell in the battle of heroes, on Lena's echoing heath. High on his car, of many gems, the chief of Erin stood. He slew a mighty son of Lochlin, and spoke, in haste, to Connal. “O Connal, first of mortal men, thou hast taught this arm of death! Though Erin's sons have fled, shall we not fight the foe? Carril, son of other times, carry my friends to that bushy hill. Here, Connal, let us stand like rocks, and save our flying friends.” Connal mounts the car of gems. They stretch their shields, like the darkened moon, the daughter of the starry skies, when she moves, a dun circle, through heaven; and dreadful change is expected by men. Sithfadda panted up the hill, and Sronnal, haughty steed. Like waves behind a whale behind them rushed the foe. Now, on the rising side of Cromla stood Erin's few sad sons; like a grove through which the flame had rushed, hurried on by the winds of the stormy night; distant, withered, dark they stand, with not a leaf to shake in the gale. Cuthullin stood beside an oak. He rolled his red eye in silence, and heard the wind in his bushy hair; the scout of ocean came, Moran, the son of Fithil. “The ships,” he cried, “the ships of the lonely isles. Fingal comes, the first of men, the breaker of the shields! The waves foam before his black prows! His masts with sails are like groves in clouds!” “Blow,” said Cuthullin, “blow, ye winds, that rush along my isle of mist! Come to the death of thousands, O king of resounding Selma! Thy sails, my friend, are to me the clouds of the morning; thy ships the light of heaven; and thou thyself a pillar of fire, that beams on the world by night. O Connal, first of men, how pleasing, in grief, are our friends! But the night is gathering around! Where now are the ships of Fingal? Here let us pass the hours of darkness; here wish for the moon of heaven.” The winds come down on the woods. The torrents rush from the rocks. Rain gathers round the head of Cromla. The red stars tremble between the flying clouds. Sad, by the side of a stream, whose sound is echoed by a tree, sad by the side of a stream the chief of Erin sits. Connal, son of Colgar, is there, and Carril of other times. “Unhappy is the hand of Cuthullin,” said the son of Semo, “unhappy is the hand of Cuthullin, since he slew his friend! Ferda, son of Damman, I loved thee as myself!” “How, Cuthullin, son of Semo! how fell the breaker of the shields? Well I remember,” said Connal, “the son of the noble Damman. Tall and fair he was, like the rain-bow of heaven.” “Ferda from Albion came, the chief of a hundred hills. In Muri's hall he learned the sword, and won the friendship of Cuthullin. We moved to the chace together: one was our bed in the heath!” “Deugala was the spouse of Cairbar, chief of the plains of Ullin. She was covered with the light of beauty, but her heart was the house of pride. She loved that sun-beam of youth, the son of noble Damman. “Cairbar,” said the white-armed Deugala, “give me half of the herd. No more will I remain in your halls. Divide the herd, dark Cairbar!” “Let Cuthullin,” said Cairbar, “divide my herd on the hill. His breast is the seat of justice. Depart, thou light of beauty!” I went and divided the herd. One snow-white bull remained. I gave the bull to Cairbar. The wrath of Deugala rose!” “Son of Damman,” begun the fair, “Cuthullin hath pained my soul. I must hear of his death, or Lubar's stream shall roll over me. My pale ghost shall wander near thee, and mourn the wound of my pride. Pour out the blood of Cuthullin, or pierce this heaving breast.” “Deugala,” said the fair-haired youth, “how shall I slay the son of Semo? He is the friend of my secret thoughts. Shall I then lift the sword?” She wept three days before the chief, on the fourth he said he would fight. “I will fight my friend, Deugala! but may I fall by his sword! Could I wander on the hill alone? Could I behold the grave of Cuthullin?” We fought on the plain of Muri. Our swords avoid a wound. They slide on the helmets of steel; or sound on the slippery shields. Deugala was near with a smile, and said to the son of Damman: “Thine arm is feeble, sun-beam of youth! Thy years are not strong for steel. Yield to the son of Semo. He is a rock on Malmor.” The tear is in the eye of youth. He faultering said to me: “Cuthullin, raise thy bossy shield. Defend thee from the hand of thy friend. My soul is laden with grief: for I must slay the chief of men!” I sighed as the wind in the cleft of a rock. I lifted high the edge of my steel. The sun-beam of battle fell: the first of Cuthullin's friends! Unhappy is the hand of Cuthullin since the hero fell! “Mournful is thy tale, son of the car,” said Carril of other times. “It sends my soul back to the ages of old, to the days of other years. Often have I heard of Comal, who slew the friend he loved; yet victory attended his steel: the battle was consumed in his presence! Comal was a son of Albion; the chief of an hundred hills! His deer drunk of a thousand streams. A thousand rocks replied to the voice of his dogs. His face was the mildness of youth. His hand the death of heroes. One was his love, and fair was she! the daughter of mighty Conloch. She appeared like a sun-beam among women. Her hair was the wing of the raven. Her dogs were taught to the chace. Her bow-string sounded on the winds. Her soul was fixed on Comal. Often met their eyes of love. Their course in the chace was one. Happy were their words in secret. But Grumal loved the maid, the dark chief of the gloomy Ardven. He watched her lone steps in the heath; the foe of unhappy Comal! One day, tired of the chace, when the mist had concealed their friends, Comal and the daughter of Conloch met, in the cave of Ronan. It was the wonted haunt of Comal. Its sides were hung with his arms. A hundred shields of thongs were there; a hundred helms of sounding steel. “Rest here,” he said, “my love, Galbina: thou light of the cave of Ronan! A deer appears on Mora's brow. I go; but I will soon return.” “I fear,” she said, “dark Grumal my foe: he haunts the cave of Ronan! I will rest among the arms; but soon return, my love!” He went to the deer of Mora. The daughter of Conloch would try his love. She cloathed her fair sides with his armour; she strode from the cave of Ronan! He thought it was his foe. His heart beat high. His colour changed, and darkness dimmed his eyes. He drew the bow. The arrow flew. Galbina fell in blood! He run with wildness in his steps: he called the daughter of Conloch. No answer in the lonely rock. “Where art thou, O my love?” He saw, at length, her heaving heart, beating around the arrow he threw. “O Conloch's daughter, is it thou?” He sunk upon her breast! The hunters found the hapless pair; he afterwards walked the hill. But many and silent were his steps round the dark dwelling of his love. The fleet of the ocean came. He fought, the strangers fled. He searched for death along the field. But who could slay the mighty Comal! He threw away his dark-brown shield. An arrow found his manly breast. He sleeps with his loved Galbina, at the noise of the sounding surge! Their green tombs are seen by the mariner, when he bounds on the waves of the north. BOOK III. ARGUMENT TO BOOK III. Cuthullin, pleased with the story of Carril, insists with that bard for more of his songs. He relates the actions of Fingal in Lochlin, and death of Agandecca, the beautiful sister of Swaran. He had scarce finished, when Calmar, the son of Matha, who had advised the first battle, came wounded from the field, and told them of Swaran's design to surprise the remains of the Irish army. He himself proposes to withstand singly the whole force of the enemy, in a narrow pass, till the Irish should make good their retreat. Cuthullin touched with the gallant proposal of Calmar, resolves to accompany him, and orders Carril to carry off the few that remained of the Irish. Morning comes, Calmar dies of his wounds; and, the ships of the Caledonians appearing, Swaran gives over the pursuit of the Irish, and returns to oppose Fingal's landing. Cuthullin ashamed, after his defeat, to appear before Fingal, retires to the cave of Tura. Fingal engages the enemy, puts them to flight; but the coming on of night makes the victory not decisive. The king, who had observed the gallant behaviour of his grandson Oscar, gives him advices concerning his conduct in peace and war. He recommends to him to place the example of his fathers before his eyes, as the best model for his conduct; which introduces the episode concerning Fainasollis, the daughter of the king of Craca, whom Fingal had taken under his protection, in his youth. Fillan and Oscar are dispatched to observe the motions of the enemy by night; Gaul, the son of Morni, desires the command of the army, in the next battle; which Fingal promises to give him. Some general reflections of the poet close the third day. Macpherson. “Pleasant are the words of the song,” said Cuthullin! “lovely the tales of other times! They are like the calm dew of the morning on the hill of roes, when the sun is faint on its side, and the lake is settled and blue in the vale. O Carril, raise again thy voice; let me hear the song of Selma: which was sung in my halls of joy, when Fingal, king of shields, was there, and glowed at the deeds of his fathers.” “Fingal! thou dweller of battle,” said Carril, “early were thy deeds in arms. Lochlin was consumed in thy wrath, when thy youth strove with the beauty of maids. They smiled at the fair-blooming face of the hero; but death was in his hands. He was strong as the waters of Lora. His followers were the roar of a thousand streams. They took the king of Lochlin in war; they restored him to his ships. His big heart swelled with pride; the death of the youth was dark in his soul. For none ever, but Fingal, had overcome the strength of the mighty Starno. He sat in the hall of his shells in Lochlin's woody land. He called the grey-haired Snivan, that often sung round the circle of Loda: when the stone of power heard his voice, and battle turned in the field of the valiant! “Go, grey-haired Snivan,” Starno said, “go to Ardven's sea-surrounded rocks. Tell to the king of Selma; he, the fairest among his thousands, tell him I give him my daughter, the loveliest maid that ever heaved a breast of snow. Her arms are white as the foam of my waves. Her soul is generous and mild. Let him come with his bravest heroes to the daughter of the secret hall!” Snivan came to Selma's hall: Fair-haired Fingal attended his steps. His kindled soul flew to the maid, as he bounded on the waves of the north. “Welcome,” said the dark-brown Starno, “Welcome, king of rocky Morven: Welcome his heroes of might; sons of the distant isle! Three days within my halls shall ye feast; three days pursue my boars; that your fame may reach the maid who dwells in the secret hall.” Starno designed their death. He gave the feast of shells. Fingal, who doubted the foe, kept on his arms of steel. The sons of death were afraid: They fled from the eyes of the king. The voice of sprightly mirth arose. The trembling harps of joy were strung. Bards sung the battle of heroes: They sung the heaving breast of love. Ullin, Fingal's bard, was there: the sweet voice of resounding Cona. He praised the daughter of Lochlin; and Morven's high-descended chief. The daughter of Lochlin overheard. She left the hall of her secret sigh! She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the east. Loveliness was around her as light. Her steps were the music of songs. She saw the youth, and loved him. He was the stolen sigh of her soul. Her blue eye rolled on him in secret: she blest the chief of resounding Morven. The third day, with all its beams, shone bright on the wood of boars. Forth moved the dark-browed Starno; and Fingal, king of shields. Half the day they spent in the chace; the spear of Selma was red in blood. It was then the daughter of Starno, with blue eyes rolling in tears; it was then she came with her voice of love, and spoke to the king of Morven. “Fingal, high-descended chief, trust not Starno's heart of pride. Within that wood he has placed his chiefs. Beware of the wood of death. But, remember, son of the isle, remember Agandecca: save me from the wrath of my father, king of the windy Morven!” The youth, with unconcern, went on; his heroes by his side. The sons of death fell by his hand; and Gormal echoed around! Before the halls of Starno the sons of the chace convened. The king's dark brows were like clouds. His eyes like meteors of night. “Bring hither,” he said, “Agandecca to her lovely king of Morven! His hand is stained with the blood of my people; her words have not been in vain!” She came with the red eye of tears. She came with loosely flowing locks. Her white breast heaved with broken sighs, like the foam of the streamy Lubar. Starno pierced her side with steel. She fell, like a wreath of snow, which slides from the rocks of Ronan; when the woods are still, and echo deepens in the vale! Then Fingal eyed his valiant chiefs, his valiant chiefs took arms. The gloom of battle roared; Lochlin fled or died. Pale, in his bounding ship he closed the maid of the softest soul. Her tomb ascends on Ardven; the sea roars round her narrow dwelling. “Blessed be her soul;” said Cuthullin, “blessed be the mouth of the song! Strong was the youth of Fingal; strong is his arm of age. Lochlin shall fall again before the king of echoing Morven. Shew thy face from a cloud, O moon; light his white sails on the wave: And if any strong spirit of heaven sits on that low-hung cloud; turn his dark ships from the rock, thou rider of the storm!” Such were the words of Cuthullin at the sound of the mountain-stream, when Calmar ascended the hill, the wounded son of Matha. From the field he came in his blood. He leaned on his bending spear. Feeble is the arm of battle! but strong the soul of the hero! “Welcome! O son of Matha,” said Connal, “welcome art thou to thy friends! Why bursts that broken sigh, from the breast of him who never feared before?” “And never, Connal, will he fear, chief of the pointed steel! My soul brightens in danger: in the noise of arms. I am of the race of battle. My fathers never feared. “Cormar was the first of my race. He sported through the storms of waves. His black skiff bounded on ocean; he travelled on the wings of the wind. A spirit once embroiled the night. Seas swell, and rocks resound. Winds drive along the clouds. The lightning flies on wings of fire. He feared and came to land: then blushed that he feared at all. He rushed again among the waves to find the son of the wind. Three youths guide the bounding bark; he stood with sword unsheathed. When the low-hung vapour passed, he took it by the curling head. He searched its dark womb with his steel. The son of the wind forsook the air. The moon and stars returned! Such was the boldness of my race. Calmar is like his fathers. Danger flies from the lifted sword. They best succeed who dare! “But now, ye sons of green Erin, retire from Lena's bloody heath. Collect the sad remnant of our friends, and join the sword of Fingal. I heard the sound of Lochlin's advancing arms! Calmar will remain and fight. My voice shall be such, my friends, as if thousands were behind me. But, son of Semo, remember me. Remember Calmar's lifeless corse. When Fingal shall have wasted the field, place me by some stone of remembrance, that future times may hear my fame, that the mother of Calmar may rejoice in my renown.” “No: son of Matha,” said Cuthullin, “I will never leave thee here. My joy is in unequal fight: my soul increases in danger. Connal, and Carril of other times, carry off the sad sons of Erin. When the battle is over, search for us in this narrow way. For near this oak we shall fall, in the stream of the battle of thousands!” “O Fithil's son, with flying speed rush over the heath of Lena. Tell to Fingal that Erin is fallen. Bid the king of Morven come. O let him come, like the sun in a storm, to lighten, to restore the isle!” Morning is grey on Cromla. The sons of the sea ascend. Calmar stood forth to meet them in the pride of his kindling soul. But pale was the face of the chief. He leaned on his father's spear. That spear which he brought from Lara, when the soul of his mother was sad; the soul of the lonely Alcletha, waining in the sorrow of years. But slowly now the hero falls, like a tree on the plain. Dark Cuthullin stands alone, like a rock in a sandy vale. The sea comes with its waves, and roars on its hardened sides. Its head is covered with foam; the hills are echoing around. Now from the grey mist of the ocean, the white-sailed ships of Fingal appear. High is the grove of their masts, as they nod, by turns, on the rolling wave. Swaran saw them from the hill. He returned from the sons of Erin. As ebbs the resounding sea, through the hundred isles of Inistore; so loud, so vast, so immense returned the sons of Lochlin against the king. But bending, weeping, sad, and slow, and dragging his long spear behind, Cuthullin sunk in Cromla's wood, and mourned his fallen friends. He feared the face of Fingal, who was wont to greet him from the fields of renown! “How many lie there of my heroes! the chiefs of Erin's race! they that were chearful in the hall, when the sound of the shells arose! No more shall I find their steps in the heath. No more shall I hear their voice in the chace. Pale, silent, low on bloody beds, are they who were my friends! O spirits of the lately dead, meet Cuthullin on his heath. Speak to him on the wind, when the rustling tree of Tura's cave resounds. There, far remote, I shall lie unknown. No bard shall hear of me. No grey stone shall rise to my renown. Mourn me with the dead, O Bragela! departed is my fame.” Such were the words of Cuthullin, when he sunk in the woods of Cromla! Fingal, tall in his ship, stretched his bright lance before him. Terrible was the gleam of the steel: it was like the green meteor of death, setting in the heath of Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven. “The battle is past,” said the king. “I behold the blood of my friends. Sad is the heath of Lena! mournful the oaks of Cromla. The hunters have fallen in their strength: the son of Semo is no more. Ryno and Fillan, my sons, sound the horn of Fingal. Ascend that hill on the shore; call the children of the foe. Call them from the grave of Lamdarg, the chief of other times. Be your voice like that of your father, when he enters the battles of his strength. I wait for the mighty stranger. I wait on Lena's shore for Swaran. Let him come with his race; strong in battle are the friends of the dead!” Fair Ryno as lightning gleamed along: Dark Fillan rushed like the shade of autumn. On Lena's heath their voice is heard. The sons of ocean heard the horn of Fingal. As the roaring eddy of ocean returning from the kingdom of snows; so strong, so dark, so sudden came down the sons of Lochlin. The king in their front appears, in the dismal pride of his arms! Wrath burns on his dark-brown face: his eyes roll in the fire of his valour. Fingal beheld the son of Starno: he remembered Agandecca. For Swaran with the tears of youth had mourned his white-bosomed sister. He sent Ullin of songs to bid him to the feast of shells: For pleasant on Fingal's soul returned the memory of the first of his loves! Ullin came with aged steps, and spoke to Starno's son. “O thou that dwellest afar, surrounded, like a rock, with thy waves! come to the feast of the king, and pass the day in rest. To-morrow let us fight, O Swaran, and break the echoing shields.” “To-day,” said Starno's wrathful son, “we break the echoing shields: to-morrow my feast shall be spread; but Fingal shall lie on earth.” “To-morrow let his feast be spread,” said Fingal with a smile. “To-day, O my sons, we shall break the echoing shields. Ossian, stand thou near my arm. Gaul, lift thy terrible sword. Fergus, bend thy crooked yew. Throw, Fillan, thy lance through heaven. Lift your shields, like the darkened moon. Be your spears the meteors of death. Follow me in the path of my fame. Equal my deeds in battle.” As a hundred winds on Morven; as the streams of a hundred hills; as clouds fly successive over heaven; as the dark ocean assails the shore of the desart: so roaring, so vast, so terrible the armies mixed on Lena's echoing heath. The groan of the people spread over the hills: it was like the thunder of night, when the cloud bursts on Cona, and a thousand ghosts shriek at once on the hollow wind. Fingal rushed on in his strength, terrible as the spirit of Trenmor; when, in a whirlwind, he comes to Morven, to see the children of his pride. The oaks resound on their mountains, and the rocks fall down before him. Dimly seen, as lightens the night, he strides largely from hill to hill. Bloody was the hand of my father, when he whirled the gleam of his sword. He remembers the battles of his youth. The field is wasted in the course! Ryno went on like a pillar of fire. Dark is the brow of Gaul. Fergus rushed forward with feet of wind. Fillan, like the mist of the hill. Ossian, like a rock, came down. I exulted in the strength of the king. Many were the deaths of my arm! dismal the gleam of my sword! My locks were not then so grey; nor trembled my hands with age. My eyes were not closed in darkness; my feet failed not in the race! Who can relate the deaths of the people? Who the deeds of mighty heroes? when Fingal, burning in his wrath, consumed the sons of Lochlin? groans swelled on groans from hill to hill, till night had covered all. Pale, staring like a herd of deer, the sons of Lochlin convene on Lena. We sat and heard the sprightly harp, at Lubar's gentle stream. Fingal himself was next to the foes. He listened to the tales of his bards. His godlike race were in the song, the chiefs of other times. Attentive, leaning on his shield, the king of Morven sat. The wind whistled through his locks; his thoughts are of the days of other years. Near him on his bending spear, my young, my valiant Oscar stood. He admired the king of Morven: his deeds were swelling in his soul! “Son of my son,” begun the king, “O Oscar, pride of youth! I saw the shining of thy sword. I gloried in my race. Pursue the fame of our fathers; be thou what they have been, when Trenmor lived, the first of men, and Trathal, the father of heroes! They fought the battle in their youth. They are the song of bards. O Oscar! bend the strong in arm: but spare the feeble hand. Be thou a stream of many tides against the foes of thy people; but like the gale, that moves the grass, to those who ask thine aid. So Trenmor lived; such Trathal was; and such has Fingal been. My arm was the support of the injured; the weak rested behind the lightning of my steel. “Oscar! I was young like thee, when lovely Fainasóllis came: that sun-beam! that mild light of love! the daughter of Craca's king! I then returned to Cona's heath, and few were in my train. A white-sailed boat appeared far off; we saw it like a mist, that rode on ocean's wind. It soon approached. We saw the fair. Her white breast heaved with sighs. The wind was in her loose dark hair: her rosy cheek had tears. “Daughter of beauty,” calm I said, “what sigh is in thy breast? Can I, young as I am, defend thee, daughter of the sea? My sword is not unmatched in war, but dauntless is my heart.” “To thee I fly,” with sighs she said, “O prince of mighty men! To thee I fly, chief of the generous shells, supporter of the feeble hand! The king of Craca's echoing isle owned me the sun-beam of his race. Cromla's hills have heard the sighs of love for unhappy Fainasóllis! Sora's chief beheld me fair; he loved the daughter of Craca. His sword is a beam of light upon the warrior's side. But dark is his brow; and tempests are in his soul. I shun him, on the roaring sea; but Sora's chief pursues.” “Rest thou,” I said, “behind my shield; rest in peace, thou beam of light! the gloomy chief of Sora will fly, if Fingal's arm is like his soul. In some lone cave I might conceal thee, daughter of the sea! but Fingal never flies. Where the danger threatens, I rejoice in the storm of spears.” I saw the tears upon her cheek. I pitied Craca's fair. Now, like a dreadful wave afar, appeared the ship of stormy Borbar. His masts high-bended over the sea, behind their sheets of snow. White roll the waters on either side. The strength of ocean sounds. “Come thou,” I said, “from the roar of ocean, thou rider of the storm! Partake the feast within my hall. It is the house of strangers.” “The maid stood trembling by my side. He drew the bow. She fell. “Unerring is thy hand,” I said, “but feeble was the foe!” We fought, nor weak the strife of death! He sunk beneath my sword. We laid them in two tombs of stone; the hapless lovers of youth! Such have I been in my youth, O Oscar; be thou like the age of Fingal. Never search thou for battle, nor shun it when it comes. “Fillan and Oscar of the dark-brown hair! ye, that are swift in the race! fly over the heath in my presence. View the sons of Lochlin. Far off I hear the noise of their fear, like distant sounds in woods. Go: that they may not fly from my sword, along the waves of the north. For many chiefs of Erin's race, lie here on the dark bed of death. The children of war are low; the sons of echoing Cromla.” The heroes flew like two dark clouds: two dark clouds that are the chariots of ghosts; when air's dark children come forth to frighten hapless men. It was then that Gaul, the son of Morni, stood like a rock in night. His spear is glittering to the stars; his voice like many streams. “Son of battle,” cried the chief, “O Fingal, king of shells! let the bards of many songs sooth Erin's friends to rest. Fingal, sheath thou thy sword of death; and let thy people fight. We wither away without our fame; our king is the only breaker of shields! When morning rises on our hills, behold, at a distance, our deeds. Let Lochlin feel the sword of Morni's son; that bards may sing of me. Such was the custom heretofore of Fingal's noble race. Such was thine own, thou king of swords, in battles of the spear.” “O son of Morni,” Fingal replied, “I glory in thy fame. Fight; but my spear shall be near, to aid thee in the midst of danger. Raise, raise the voice, ye sons of song, and lull me into rest. Here will Fingal lie, amidst the wind of night. And if thou, Agandecca, art near, among the children of thy land; if thou sittest on a blast of wind, among the high-shrouded masts of Lochlin; come to my dreams, my fair one. Shew thy bright face to my soul.” Many a voice and many a harp, in tuneful sounds arose. Of Fingal's noble deeds they sung; of Fingal's noble race: And sometimes, on the lovely sound, was heard the name of Ossian. I often fought, and often won, in battles of the spear. But blind, and tearful, and forlorn I walk with little men! O Fingal, with thy race of war I now behold thee not! The wild roes feed on the green tomb of the mighty king of Morven! Blest be thy soul, thou king of swords, thou most renowned on the hills of Cona! BOOK IV. ARGUMENT TO BOOK IV. The action of the poem being suspended by night, Ossian takes that opportunity to relate his own actions at the lake of Lego, and his courtship of Evirallin, who was the mother of Oscar, and had died some time before the expedition of Fingal into Ireland. Her ghost appears to him, and tells him that Oscar, who had been sent, the beginning of the night, to observe the enemy, was engaged with an advanced party, and almost overpowered. Ossian relieves his son, and an alarm is given to Fingal of the approach of Swaran. The king rises, calls his army together, and, as he had promised the preceding night, devolves the command on Gaul, the son of Morni, while he himself, after charging his sons to behave gallantly, and defend his people, retires to a hill, from whence he could have a view of the battle. The battle joins; the poet relates Oscar's great actions. But when Oscar, in conjunction with his father, conquered in one wing, Gaul, who was attacked by Swaran in person, was on the point of retreating in the other. Fingal sends Ullin his bard to encourage him with a war song, but notwithstanding Swaran prevails; and Gaul and his army are obliged to give way. Fingal, descending from the hill, rallies them again: Swaran desists from the pursuit, possesses himself of a rising ground, restores the ranks, and waits the approach of Fingal. The king, having encouraged his men, gives the necessary orders, and renews the battle. Cuthullin, who, with his friend Connal, and Carril, his bard, had retired to the cave of Tura, hearing the noise, came to the brow of the hill, which overlooked the field of battle, where he saw Fingal engaged with the enemy. He, being hindered by Connal from joining Fingal, who was himself upon the point of obtaining a complete victory, sends Carril to congratulate that hero on his success. Macpherson. Who comes with her songs from the hill, like the bow of the showery Lena? It is the maid of the voice of love! The white-armed daughter of Toscar! Often hast thou heard my song; often given the tear of beauty. Dost thou come to the wars of thy people? to hear the actions of Oscar? When shall I cease to mourn, by the streams of resounding Cona? My years have passed away in battle. My age is darkened with grief! Daughter of the hand of snow! I was not so mournful and blind. I was not so dark and forlorn, when Evirallin loved me! Evirallin with the dark-brown hair, the white-bosomed daughter of Branno! A thousand heroes sought the maid, she refused her love to a thousand. The sons of the sword were despised: for graceful in her eyes was Ossian! I went, in suit of the maid, to Lego's sable surge. Twelve of my people were there, the sons of streamy Morven! We came to Branno, friend of strangers! Branno of the sounding mail! “From whence,” he said, “are the arms of steel? Not easy to win is the maid, who has denied the blue-eyed sons of Erin! But blest be thou, O son of Fingal! Happy is the maid that waits thee! Though twelve daughters of beauty were mine, thine were the choice, thou son of fame!” He opened the hall of the maid, the dark-haired Evirallin. Joy kindled in our manly breasts. We blest the maid of Branno. Above us on the hill appeared the people of stately Cormac. Eight were the heroes of the chief. The heath flamed wide with their arms. There Colla; there Durra of wounds, there mighty Toscar, and Tago, there Frestal the victorious stood; Dairo of the happy deeds: Dala, the battle's bulwark in the narrow way! The sword flamed in the hand of Cormac. Graceful was the look of the hero! Eight were the heroes of Ossian. Ullin stormy son of war. Mullo of the generous deeds. The noble, the graceful Scelacha. Oglan, and Cerdal, the wrathful. Dumariccan's brows of death! And why should Ogar be the last; so wide renowned on the hills of Ardven? Ogar met Dala the strong, face to face, on the field of heroes. The battle of the chiefs was, like wind, on ocean's foamy waves. The dagger is remembered by Ogar; the weapon which he loved. Nine times he drowned it in Dala's side. The stormy battle turned. Three times I broke on Cormac's shield: three times he broke his spear. But, unhappy youth of love! I cut his head away. Five times I shook it by the lock. The friends of Cormac fled. Whoever would have told me, lovely maid, when then I strove in battle; that blind, forsaken, and forlorn, I now should pass the night; firm ought his mail to have been; unmatched his arm in war! “On Lena's gloomy heath, the voice of music died away. The unconstant blast blew hard. The high oak shook its leaves around. Of Evirallin were my thoughts, when in all the light of beauty she came. Her blue eyes rolling in tears. She stood on a cloud before my sight, and spoke with feeble voice! “Rise, Ossian, rise and save my son; save Oscar, prince of men. Near the red oak of Luba's stream, he fights with Lochlin's sons.” She sunk into her cloud again. I covered me with steel. My spear supported my steps; my rattling armour rung. I hummed, as I was wont in danger, the songs of heroes of old. Like distant thunder Lochlin heard. They fled; my son pursued. I called him like a distant stream. “Oscar, return over Lena! No further pursue the foe,” I said, “though Ossian is behind thee.” He came; and pleasant to my ear was Oscar's sounding steel. “Why didst thou stop my hand,” he said, “till death had covered all? For dark and dreadful by the stream they met thy son and Fillan! They watched the terrors of the night. Our swords have conquered some. But as the winds of night pour the ocean, over the white sands of Mora, so dark advance the sons of Lochlin, over Lena's rustling heath! The ghosts of night shriek afar: I have seen the meteors of death. Let me awake the king of Morven, he that smiles in danger! He that is like the son of heaven, rising in a storm!” Fingal had started from a dream, and leaned on Trenmor's shield; the dark brown shield of his fathers, which they had lifted of old in war. The hero had seen, in his rest, the mournful form of Agandecca. She came from the way of the ocean. She slowly, lonely, moved over Lena. Her face was pale like the mist of Cromla. Dark were the tears of her cheek. She often raised her dim hand from her robe: her robe, which was of the clouds of the desart: she raised her dim hand over Fingal, and turned away her silent eyes! “Why weeps the daughter of Starno?” said Fingal, with a sigh; “why is thy face so pale, fair wanderer of the clouds?” She departed on the wind of Lena. She left him in the midst of the night. She mourned the sons of her people, that were to fall by the hand of Fingal. The hero started from rest. Still he beheld her in his soul. The sound of Oscar's steps approached. The king saw the grey shield on his side: For the faint beam of the morning came over the waters of Ullin. “What do the foes in their fear?” said the rising king of Morven; “or fly they through ocean's foam, or wait they the battle of steel? But why should Fingal ask? I hear their voice on the early wind! Fly over Lena's heath: O Oscar, awake our friends!” The king stood by the stone of Lubar. Thrice he reared his terrible voice. The deer started from the fountains of Cromla. The rocks shook on all their hills. Like the noise of a hundred mountain-streams, that burst, and roar, and foam! like the clouds, that gather to a tempest on the blue face of the sky! so met the sons of the desart, round the terrible voice of Fingal. Pleasant was the voice of the king of Morven to the warriors of his land. Often had he led them to battle; often returned with the spoils of the foe! “Come to battle,” said the king, “ye children of echoing Selma! Come to the death of thousands. Comhal's son will see the fight. My sword shall wave on the hill, the defence of my people in war. But never may you need it, warriors: while the son of Morni fights, the chief of mighty men! He shall lead my battle; that his fame may rise in song! O ye ghosts of heroes dead! ye riders of the storm of Cromla! receive my falling people with joy, and bear them to your hills. And may the blast of Lena carry them over my seas, that they may come to my silent dreams, and delight my soul in rest! Fillan and Oscar, of the dark-brown hair! fair Ryno, with the pointed steel! advance with valour to the fight. Behold the son of Morni! Let your swords be like his in strife: behold the deeds of his hand. Protect the friends of your father. Remember the chiefs of old. My children, I will see you yet, though here ye should fall in Erin. Soon shall our cold, pale ghosts meet in a cloud on Cona's eddying winds.” Now, like a dark and stormy cloud, edged round with the red lightning of heaven; flying westward from the morning's beam, the king of Selma removed. Terrible is the light of his armour; two spears are in his hand. His grey hair falls on the wind. He often looks back on the war. Three bards attend the son of fame, to bear his words to the chiefs. High on Cromla's side he sat, waving the lightning of his sword, and as he waved we moved. Joy rises in Oscar's face. His cheek is red. His eye sheds tears. The sword is a beam of fire in his hand. He came, and smiling, spoke to Ossian. “O ruler of the fight of steel! my father, hear thy son! Retire with Morven's mighty chief. Give me the fame of Ossian. If here I fall: O chief, remember that breast of snow, the lonely sun-beam of my love, the white-handed daughter of Toscar! For, with red cheek from the rock, bending over the stream, her soft hair flies about her bosom, as she pours the sigh for Oscar. Tell her I am on my hills, a lightly-bounding son of the wind; tell her, that in a cloud, I may meet the lovely maid of Toscar.” “Raise, Oscar, rather raise my tomb. I will not yield the war to thee. The first and bloodiest in the strife, my arm shall teach thee how to fight. But, remember, my son, to place this sword, this bow, the horn of my deer, within that dark and narrow house, whose mark is one grey stone! Oscar, I have no love to leave to the care of my son. Evirallin is no more, the lovely daughter of Branno!” Such were our words, when Gaul's loud voice came growing on the wind. He waved on high the sword of his father. We rushed to death and wounds. As waves, white-bubbling over the deep, come swelling, roaring on; as rocks of ooze meet roaring waves: so foes attacked and fought. Man met with man, and steel with steel. Shields sound, and warriors fall. As a hundred hammers on the red son of the furnace, so rose, so rung their swords! Gaul rushed on, like a whirlwind in Ardven. The destruction of heroes is on his sword. Swaran was like the fire of the desart in the echoing heath of Gormal! How can I give to the song the death of many spears? My sword rose high, and flamed in the strife of blood. Oscar, terrible wert thou, my best, my greatest son! I rejoiced in my secret soul, when his sword flamed over the slain. They fled amain through Lena's heath. We pursued and slew. As stones that bound from rock to rock; as axes in echoing woods; as thunder rolls from hill to hill, in dismal broken peals; so blow succeeded to blow, and death to death, from the hand of Oscar and mine. But Swaran closed round Morni's son, as the strength of the tide of Inistore. The king half-rose from his hill at the sight. He half-assumed the spear. “Go, Ullin, go, my aged bard,” begun the king of Morven. “Remind the mighty Gaul of war. Remind him of his fathers. Support the yielding fight with song; for song enlivens war.” Tall Ullin went, with step of age, and spoke to the king of swords. “Son of the chief of generous steeds! high-bounding king of spears. Strong arm in every perilous toil. Hard heart that never yields. Chief of the pointed arms of death. Cut down the foe; let no white sail bound round dark Inistore. Be thine arm like thunder. Thine eyes like fire, thy heart of solid rock. Whirl round thy sword as a meteor at night; lift thy shield like the flame of death. Son of the chief of generous steeds, cut down the foe. Destroy!” The hero's heart beat high. But Swaran came with battle. He cleft the shield of Gaul in twain. The sons of Selma fled. Fingal at once arose in arms. Thrice he reared his dreadful voice. Cromla answered around. The sons of the desart stood still. They bent their blushing faces to earth, ashamed at the presence of the king. He came, like a cloud of rain in the day of the sun, when slow it rolls on the hill, and fields expect the shower. Silence attends its slow progress aloft; but the tempest is soon to arise. Swaran beheld the terrible king of Morven. He stopped in the midst of his course. Dark he leaned on his spear, rolling his red eyes around. Silent and tall he seemed as an oak on the banks of Lubar, which had its branches blasted of old by the lightning of heaven. It bends over the stream: the grey moss whistles in the wind: so stood the king. Then slowly he retired to the rising heath of Lena. His thousands pour around the hero. Darkness gathers on the hill! Fingal, like a beam from heaven, shone in the midst of his people. His heroes gather around him. He sends forth the voice of his power. “Raise my standards on high; spread them on Lena's wind, like the flames of an hundred hills! Let them sound on the winds of Erin, and remind us of the fight. Ye sons of the roaring streams, that pour from a thousand hills, be near the king of Morven! attend to the words of his power! Gaul strongest arm of death! O Oscar, of the future fights! Connal son of the blue shields of Sora! Dermid of the dark-brown hair! Ossian king of many songs, be near your father's arm!” We reared the sun-beam of battle; the standard of the king! Each hero exulted with joy, as, waving, it flew on the wind. It was studded with gold above, as the blue wide shell of the nightly sky. Each hero had his standard too; and each his gloomy men! “Behold,” said the king of generous shells, “how Lochlin divides on Lena! they stand like broken clouds on a hill; or an half-consumed grove of oaks: when we see the sky through its branches, and the meteor passing behind! Let every chief among the friends of Fingal take a dark troop of those that frown so high: Nor let a son of the echoing groves bound on the waves of Inistore! “Mine,” said Gaul, “be the seven chiefs, that came from Lano's lake.” “Let Inistore's dark king,” said Oscar, “come to the sword of Ossian's son.” To mine the king of Iniscon,” said Connal, “heart of steel!” “Or Mudan's chief or I,” said brown-haired Dermid, “shall sleep on clay-cold earth.” My choice, though now so weak and dark, was Terman's battling king; I promised with my hand to win the hero's dark-brown shield. “Blest and victorious be my chiefs,” said Fingal of the mildest look. “Swaran, king of roaring waves, thou art the choice of Fingal!” Now, like a hundred different winds, that pour through many vales; divided, dark the sons of Selma advanced. Cromla echoed around! How can I relate the deaths, when we closed in the strife of arms! O daughter of Toscar! bloody were our hands! The gloomy ranks of Lochlin fell, like the banks of the roaring Cona! Our arms were victorious on Lena: each chief fulfilled his promise! Beside the murmur of Branno thou didst often sit, O maid! thy white bosom rose frequent like the down of the swan when slow she swims on the lake, and sidelong winds blow on her ruffled wing. Thou hast seen the sun retire, red and slow behind his cloud; night gathering round on the mountain, while the unfrequent blast roared in the narrow vales. At length the rain beats hard: thunder rolls in peals. Lightning glances on the rocks! Spirits ride on beams of fire! The strength of the mountain-streams comes roaring down the hills. Such was the noise of battle, maid of the arms of snow! Why, daughter of Toscar, why that tear? The maids of Lochlin have cause to weep! The people of their country fell. Bloody were the blue swords of the race of my heroes! But I am sad, forlorn, and blind: no more the companion of heroes. Give, lovely maid, to me thy tears. I have seen the tombs of all my friends! It was then, by Fingal's hand, a hero fell, to his grief! Grey-haired he rolled in the dust. He lifted his faint eyes to the king. “And is it by me thou hast fallen,” said the son of Comhal, “thou friend of Agandecca! I have seen thy tears for the maid of my love in the halls of the bloody Starno! Thou hast been the foe of the foes of my love, and hast thou fallen by my hand? Raise, Ullin, raise the grave of Mathon; and give his name to Agandecca's song. Dear to my soul hast thou been, thou darkly-dwelling maid of Ardven!” Cuthullin, from the cave of Cromla, heard the noise of the troubled war. He called to Connal, chief of swords; to Carril of other times. The grey-haired heroes heard his voice. They took their pointed spears. They came, and saw the tide of battle, like ocean's crowded waves: when the dark wind blows from the deep, and rolls the billows through the sandy vale! Cuthullin kindled at the sight. Darkness gathered on his brow. His hand is on the sword of his fathers: his red-rolling eyes on the foe. He thrice attempted to rush to battle. He thrice was stopt by Connal. “Chief of the isle of mist,” he said, “Fingal subdues the foe. Seek not a part of the fame of the king; himself is like the storm!” “Then, Carril, go,” replied the chief, “go, greet the king of Morven. When Lochlin falls away like a stream after rain: when the noise of the battle is past. Then be thy voice sweet in his ear to praise the king of Selma! Give him the sword of Caithbat. Cuthullin is not worthy to lift the arms of his fathers! Come, O ye ghosts of the lonely Cromla! ye souls of chiefs that are no more! be near the steps of Cuthullin; talk to him in the cave of his grief. Never more shall I be renowned, among the mighty in the land. I am a beam that has shone; a mist that has fled away: when the blast of the morning came, and brightened the shaggy side of the hill! Connal! talk of arms no more: departed is my fame. My sighs shall be on Cromla's wind; till my footsteps cease to be seen. And thou, white-bosomed Bragela, mourn over the fall of my fame: vanquished, I will never return to thee, thou sun-beam of my soul!” BOOK V. ARGUMENT TO BOOK V. Cuthullin and Connal still remain on the hill. Fingal and Swaran meet; the combat is described. Swaran is overcome, bound and delivered over as a prisoner to the care of Ossian, and Gaul the son of Morni; Fingal, his younger sons, and Oscar, still pursue the enemy. The episode of Orla, a chief of Lochlin, who was mortally wounded in the battle, is introduced. Fingal, touched with the death of Orla, orders the pursuit to be discontinued; and, calling his sons together, he is informed that Ryno, the youngest of them, was slain. He laments his death, hears the story of Lamdarg and Gelchossa, and returns towards the place where he had left Swaran. Carril, who had been sent by Cuthullin to congratulate Fingal on his victory, comes in the mean time to Ossian. The conversation of the two poets closes the action of the fourth day. Macpherson. On Cromla's resounding side, Connal spoke to the chief of the noble car. Why that gloom, son of Semo? Our friends are the mighty in fight. Renowned art thou, O warrior! many were the deaths of thy steel. Often has Bragela met, with blue-rolling eyes of joy: often has she met her hero, returning in the midst of the valiant; when his sword was red with slaughter; when his foes were silent in the fields of the tomb. Pleasant to her ears were thy bards, when thy deeds arose in song. But behold the king of Morven! He moves, below, like a pillar of fire. His strength is like the stream of Lubar, or the wind of the echoing Cromla; when the branchy forests of night are torn from all their rocks! Happy are thy people, O Fingal! thine arm shall finish their wars. Thou art the first in their dangers: the wisest in the days of their peace. Thou speakest and thy thousands obey: armies tremble at the sound of thy steel. Happy are thy people, O Fingal, king of resounding Selma! Who is that so dark and terrible, coming in the thunder of his course? who but Starno's son to meet the king of Morven? Behold the battle of the chiefs! it is the storm of the ocean, when two spirits meet far distant, and contend for the rolling of waves. The hunter hears the noise on his hill. He sees the high billows advancing to Ardven's shore! Such were the words of Connal, when the heroes met, in fight. There was the clang of arms! there every blow, like the hundred hammers of the furnace! Terrible is the battle of the kings; dreadful the look of their eyes. Their dark-brown shields are cleft in twain. Their steel flies, broken, from their helms. They fling their weapons down. Each rushes to his hero's grasp. Their sinewy arms bend round each other; they turn from side to side, and strain and stretch their large spreading limbs below. But when the pride of their strength arose, they shook the hill with their heels. Rocks tumble from their places on high; the green-shaded bushes are overturned. At length the strength of Swaran fell: the king of the groves is bound. Thus have I seen on Cona; but Cona I behold no more! thus have I seen two dark hills, removed from their place, by the strength of the bursting stream. They turn from side to side in their fall; their tall oaks meet one another on high. Then they tumble together with all their rocks and trees. The streams are turned by their side. The red ruin is seen afar. “Sons of distant Morven.” said Fingal: “guard the king of Lochlin. He is strong as his thousand waves. His hand is taught to war. His race is of the times of old. Gaul, thou first of my heroes: Ossian, king of songs, attend. He is the friend of Agandecca; raise to joy his grief. But, Oscar, Fillan, and Ryno, ye children of the race! pursue Lochlin over Lena; that no vessel may hereafter bound, on the dark-rolling waves of Inistore!” They flew sudden across the heath. He slowly moved, like a cloud of thunder, when the sultry plain of summer is silent, and dark! His sword is before him as a sun-beam; terrible as the streaming meteor of night. He came toward a chief of Lochlin. He spoke to the son of the wave. “Who is that so dark and sad, at the rock of the roaring stream? He cannot bound over its course: How stately is the chief! His bossy shield is on his side; his spear, like the tree of the desart! Youth of the dark-red hair, art thou of the foes of Fingal?” “I am a son of Lochlin,” he cries, “strong is my arm in war. My spouse is weeping at home. Orla shall never return!” “Or fights or yields the hero,” said Fingal of the noble deeds? “Foes do not conquer in my presence: my friends are renowned in the hall. Son of the wave, follow me, partake the feast of my shells: pursue the deer of my desart: be thou the friend of Fingal.” “No:” said the hero, “I assist the feeble. My strength is with the weak in arms. My sword has been always unmatched, O warrior: let the king of Morven yield!” “I never yielded, Orla, Fingal never yielded to man. Draw thy sword and chuse thy foe. Many are my heroes!” “Does then the king refuse the fight,” said Orla of the dark-brown shield! “Fingal is a match for Orla: and he alone of all his race! But, king of Morven, if I shall fall; as one time the warrior must die; raise my tomb in the midst: let it be the greatest on Lena. Send, over the dark-blue wave, the sword of Orla to the spouse of his love; that she may shew it to her son, with tears, to kindle his soul to war.” “Son of the mournful tale,” said Fingal, “why dost thou awaken my tears? One day the warriors must die, and the children see their useless arms in the hall. But, Orla, thy tomb shall rise. Thy white-bosomed spouse shall weep over thy sword.” They fought on the heath of Lena. Feeble was the arm of Orla. The sword of Fingal descended, and cleft his shield in twain. It fell and glittered on the ground, as the moon on the ruffled stream. “King of Morven,” said the hero, “lift thy sword and pierce my breast. Wounded and faint from battle, my friends have left me here. The mournful tale shall come to my love, on the banks of the streamy Lota; when she is alone in the wood; and the rustling blast in the leaves!” “No;” said the king of Morven, “I will never wound thee, Orla. On the banks of Lota let her see thee, escaped from the hands of war. Let thy grey-haired father, who, perhaps, is blind with age. Let him hear the sound of thy voice, and brighten within his hall. With joy let the hero rise, and search for his son with his hands!” “But never will he find him, Fingal;” said the youth of the streamy Lota. “On Lena's heath I must die: foreign bards shall talk of me. My broad belt covers my wound of death. I give it to the wind!” The dark blood poured from his side, he fell pale on the heath of Lena. Fingal bent over him as he dies, and called his younger chiefs. “Oscar and Fillan, my sons, raise high the memory of Orla. Here let the dark-haired hero rest, far from the spouse of his love. Here let him rest in his narrow house far from the sound of Lota. The feeble will find his bow at home; but will not be able to bend it. His faithful dogs howl on his hills; his boars, which he used to pursue, rejoice. Fallen is the arm of battle! the mighty among the valiant is low! Exalt the voice and blow the horn, ye sons of the king of Morven! Let us go back to Swaran, to send the night away on song. Fillan, Oscar, and Ryno, fly over the heath of Lena. Where, Ryno, art thou, young son of fame? Thou art not wont to be the last to answer thy father's voice!” “Ryno,” said Ullin, first of bards, “is with the awful forms of his fathers. With Trathal, king of shields; with Trenmor of mighty deeds. The youth is low, the youth is pale, he lies on Lena's heath!” “Fell the swiftest in the race,” said the king, “the first to bend the bow? Thou scarce hast been known to me! why did young Ryno fall? But sleep thou softly on Lena, Fingal shall soon behold thee. Soon shall my voice be heard no more, and my footsteps cease to be seen. The bards will tell of Fingal's name. The stones will talk of me. But, Ryno, thou art low indeed! thou hast not received thy fame. Ullin, strike the harp for Ryno; tell what the chief would have been. Farewell, thou first in every field! No more shall I direct thy dart! Thou that hast been so fair! I behold thee not. Farewell.” The tear is on the cheek of the king, for terrible was his son in war. His son! that was like a beam of fire by night on a hill; when the forests sink down in its course, and the traveller trembles at the sound! But the winds drive it beyond the steep. It sinks from sight, and darkness prevails. “Whose fame is in that dark-green tomb,” begun the king of generous shells? “Four stones with their heads of moss stand there! They mark the narrow house of death. Near it let Ryno rest. A neighbour to the brave let him lie. Some chief of fame is here, to fly, with my son, on clouds. O Ullin, raise the songs of old. Awake their memory in their tomb. If in the field, they never fled, my son shall rest by their side. He shall rest, far distant from Morven, on Lena's resounding plains!” “Here,” said the bard of song, “here rest the first of heroes. Silent is Lamderg in this place: dumb is Ullin, king of swords: And who, soft smiling from her cloud, shews me her face of cloud? Why, daughter, why so pale art thou, first of the maids of Cromla? Dost thou sleep with the foes in battle, white-bosomed daughter of Tuathal? Thou hast been the love of thousands, but Lamderg was thy love. He came to Tura's mossy towers, and, striking with his dark buckler spoke: “Where is Gelchossa, my love, the daughter of the noble Tuathal? I left her in the hall of Tura, when I fought with great Ulfada. Return soon, O Lamderg, she said, for here I sit in grief. Her white breast rose with sighs. Her cheek was wet with tears. But I see her not coming to meet me; to sooth my soul after war. Silent is the hall of my joy! I hear not the voice of the bard. Bran does not shake his chains at the gate, glad at the coming of Lamderg. Where is Gelchossa, my love, the mild daughter of the generous Tuathal!” “Lamderg!” says Ferchios son of Aidon, “Gelchossa moves stately on Cromla. She and the maids of the bow pursue the flying deer!” “Ferchios!” replied the chief of Cromla, “no noise meets the ear of Lamderg! No sound is in the woods of Lena. No deer fly in my sight. No panting dog pursues. I see not Gelchossa, my love, fair as the full moon setting on the hills. Go, Ferchios, go to Allad, the grey-haired son of the rock. His dwelling is in the circle of stones. He may know of the bright Gelchossa!” The son of Aidon went. He spoke to the ear of age. “Allad! dweller of rocks: thou that tremblest alone! what saw thine eyes of age?” “I saw,” answered Allad the old, “Ullin the son of Cairbar. He came, in darkness, from Cromla. He hummed a surly song, like a blast in a leafless wood. He entered the hall of Tura. “Lamderg,” he said, “most dreadful of men, fight or yield to Ullin.” “Lamderg,” replied Gelchossa, “the son of battle, is not here. He fights Ulfada, mighty chief. He is not here, thou first of men! but Lamderg never yields. He will fight the son of Cairbar!” “Lovely art thou,” said terrible Ullin, “daughter of the generous Tuathal. I carry thee to Cairbar's halls. The valiant shall have Gelchossa. Three days I remain on Cromla, to wait that son of battle, Lamderg. On the fourth Gelchossa is mine; if the mighty Lamderg flies.” “Allad!” said the chief of Cromla, “peace to thy dreams in the cave. Ferchios, sound the horn of Lamderg, that Ullin may hear in his halls.” Lamderg, like a roaring storm, ascended the hill from Tura. He hummed a surly song as he went, like the noise of a falling stream. He darkly stood upon the hill, like a cloud varying its form to the wind. He rolled a stone, the sign of war. Ullin heard in Cairbar's hall. The hero heard, with joy, his foe. He took his father's spear. A smile brightens his dark-brown cheek, as he places his sword by his side. The dagger glittered in his hand. He whistled as he went. Gelchossa saw the silent chief, as a wreath of mist ascending the hill. She struck her white and heaving breast; and silent, tearful, feared for Lamderg. “Cairbar, hoary chief of shells,” said the maid of the tender hand, “I must bend the bow on Cromla. I see the dark-brown hinds!” She hasted up the hill. In vain! the gloomy heroes fought. Why should I tell to Selma's king, how wrathful heroes fight? Fierce Ullin fell. Young Lamderg came, all pale to the daughter of the generous Tuathal! “What blood, my love, she trembling said? What blood runs down my warrior's side?” “It is Ullin's blood,” the chief replied, “thou fairer than the snow! Gelchossa, let me rest here a little while!” The mighty Lamderg died! “And sleepest thou so soon on earth, O chief of shady Tura?” Three days she mourned beside her love. The hunters found her cold. They raised this tomb above the three. Thy son, O king of Morven, may rest here with heroes! “And here my son shall rest,” said Fingal. “The voice of their fame is in mine ears. Fillan and Fergus! bring hither Orla; the pale youth of the stream of Lota! Not unequalled shall Ryno lie in earth, when Orla is by his side. Weep, ye daughters of Morven! ye maids of the streamy Lota weep! Like a tree they grew on the hills. They have fallen like the oak of the desart; when it lies across a stream, and withers in the wind. Oscar! chief of every youth! thou seest how they have fallen. Be thou like them, on earth renowned. Like them the song of bards. Terrible were their forms in battle; but calm was Ryno in the days of peace. He was like the bow of the shower seen far distant on the stream; when the sun is setting on Mora; when silence dwells on the hill of deer. Rest, youngest of my sons! rest, O Ryno, on Lena. We too shall be no more. Warriors one day must fall!” Such was thy grief, thou king of swords, when Ryno lay on earth. What must the grief of Ossian be, for thou thyself art gone! I hear not thy distant voice on Cona. My eyes perceive thee not. Often forlorn and dark I sit at thy tomb; and feel it with my hands. When I think I hear thy voice, it is but the passing blast. Fingal has long since fallen asleep, the ruler of the war! Then Gaul and Ossian sat with Swaran, on the soft green banks of Lubar. I touched the harp to please the king. But gloomy was his brow. He rolled his red eyes towards Lena. The hero mourned his host. I raised mine eyes to Cromla's brow. I saw the son of generous Semo. Sad and slow he retired, from his hill, towards the lonely cave of Tura. He saw Fingal victorious, and mixed his joy with grief. The sun is bright on his armour. Connal slowly strode behind. They sunk behind the hill, like two pillars of the fire of night: when winds pursue them over the mountain, and the flaming heath resounds! Beside a stream of roaring foam his cave is in a rock. One tree bends above it. The rushing winds echo against its sides. Here rests the chief of Erin, the son of generous Semo. His thoughts are on the battles he lost. The tear is on his cheek. He mourned the departure of his fame, that fled like the mist of Cona. O Bragela, thou art too far remote, to cheer the soul of the hero. But let him see thy bright form in his mind: that his thoughts may return to the lonely sun-beam of his love! Who comes with the locks of age? It is the son of songs. “Hail, Carril of other times! Thy voice is like the harp in the halls of Tura. Thy words are pleasant as the shower, which falls on the sunny field. Carril of the times of old, why comest thou from the son of the generous Semo?” “Ossian, king of swords,” replied the bard, “Thou best can raise the song. Long hast thou been known to Carril, thou ruler of war! Often have I touched the harp to lovely Evirallin. Thou too hast often joined my voice, in Branno's hall of generous shells. And often, amidst our voices, was heard the mildest Evirallin. One day she sung of Cormac's fall, the youth, who died for her love. I saw the tears on her cheek, and on thine, thou chief of men! Her soul was touched for the unhappy, though she loved him not. How fair among a thousand maids, was the daughter of generous Branno!” “Bring not, Carril,” I replied, “bring not her memory to my mind. My soul must melt at the remembrance. My eyes must have their tears. Pale in the earth is she, the softly-blushing fair of my love! But sit thou on the heath, O bard, and let us hear thy voice. It is pleasant as the gale of spring, that sighs on the hunter's ear; when he awakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the music of the spirits of the hill!” BOOK VI. ARGUMENT TO BOOK VI. Night comes on. Fingal gives a feast to his army, at which Swaran is present. The king commands Ullin, his bard, to give the song of peace; a custom always observed at the end of a war. Ullin relates the actions of Trenmor, great grandfather to Fingal, in Scandinavia, and his marriage with Inibaca, the daughter of a king of Lochlin, who was ancestor to Swaran; which consideration, together with his being brother to Agandecca, with whom Fingal was in love in his youth, induced the king to release him, and permit him to return, with the remains of his army, into Lochlin, upon his promise of never returning to Ireland, in a hostile manner. The night is spent in settling Swaran's departure, in songs of bards, and in a conversation, in which the story of Grumal is introduced by Fingal. Morning comes. Swaran departs; Fingal goes on a hunting party, and finding Cuthullin in the cave of Tura, comforts him, and sets sail, the next day, for Scotland; which concludes the poem. Macpherson. The clouds of night come rolling down. Darkness rests on the steeps of Cromla. The stars of the north arise over the rolling of Erin's waves: they shew their heads of fire, through the flying mist of heaven. A distant wind roars in the wood. Silent and dark is the plain of death! Still on the dusky Lena arose in my ears the voice of Carril. He sung of the friends of our youth; the days of former years! when we met on the banks of Lego: when we sent round the joy of the shell. Cromla answered to his voice. The ghosts of those he sung came in their rustling winds. They were seen to bend with joy, towards the sound of their praise! Be thy soul blest, O Carril, in the midst of thy eddying winds. O that thou wouldst come to my hall, when I am alone by night! And thou dost come, my friend. I hear often thy light hand on my harp; when it hangs, on the distant wall, and the feeble sound touches my ear. Why dost thou not speak to me in my grief, and tell when I shall behold my friends? But thou passest away in thy murmuring blast; the wind whistles through the grey hair of Ossian! Now, on the side of Mora, the heroes gathered to the feast. A thousand aged oaks are burning to the wind. The strength of the shells goes round. The souls of warriors brighten with joy. But the king of Lochlin is silent. Sorrow reddens in the eyes of his pride. He often turned toward Lena. He remembered that he fell. Fingal leaned on the shield of his fathers. His grey locks slowly waved on the wind, and glittered to the beam of night. He saw the grief of Swaran, and spoke to the first of bards. “Raise, Ullin, raise the song of peace. O sooth my soul from war. Let mine ear forget, in the sound, the dismal noise of arms. Let a hundred harps be near to gladden the king of Lochlin. He must depart from us with joy. None ever went sad from Fingal. Oscar! the lightening of my sword is against the strong in fight. Peaceful, it lies by my side when warriors yield in war.” “Trenmor,” said the mouth of songs, “lived in the days of other years. He bounded over the waves of the north: companion of the storm! The high rocks of the land of Lochlin; its groves of murmuring sounds appeared to the hero through mist: he bound his white-bosomed sails. Trenmor pursued the boar, that roared through the woods of Gormal. Many had fled from its presence: but it rolled in death on the spear of Trenmor. Three chiefs, who beheld the deed, told of the mighty stranger. They told that he stood, like a pillar of fire, in the bright arms of his valour. The king of Lochlin prepared the feast. He called the blooming Trenmor. Three days he feasted at Gormal's windy towers; and received his choice in the combat. The land of Lochlin had no hero, that yielded not to Trenmor. The shell of joy went round with songs, in praise of the king of Morven. He that came over the waves, the first of mighty men! Now when the fourth grey morn arose, the hero launched his ship. He walked along the silent shore, and called for the rushing wind: For loud and distant he heard the blast murmuring behind the groves. Covered over with arms of steel, a son of the woody Gormal appeared. Red was his cheek and fair his hair. His skin like the snow of Morven. Mild rolled his blue and smiling eye, when he spoke to the king of swords. “Stay, Trenmor, stay thou first of men, thou hast not conquered Lonval's son. My sword has often met the brave. The wise shun the strength of my bow.” “Thou fair-haired youth,” Trenmor replied, “I will not fight with Lonval's son. Thine arm is feeble, sun-beam of youth. Retire to Gormal's dark-brown hinds.” “But I will retire,” replied the youth, “with the sword of Trenmor; and exult in the sound of my fame. The virgins shall gather with smiles, around him who conquered mighty Trenmor. They shall sigh with the sighs of love, and admire the length of thy spear; when I shall carry it among thousands; when I lift the glittering point to the sun.” “Thou shalt never carry my spear,” said the angry king of Morven. “Thy mother shall find thee pale on the shore; and, looking over the dark-blue deep, see the sails of him that slew her son!” “I will not lift the spear,” replied the youth, “my arm is not strong with years. But, with the feathered dart, I have learned to pierce a distant foe. Throw down that heavy mail of steel. Trenmor is covered from death. I first, will lay my mail on earth. Throw now thy dart, thou king of Morven!” He saw the heaving of her breast. It was the sister of the king. She had seen him in the hall; and loved his face of youth. The spear dropt from the hand of Trenmor: he bent his red cheek to the ground. She was to him a beam of light that meets the sons of the cave; when they revisit the fields of the sun, and bend their aching eyes! “Chief of the windy Morven,” begun the maid of the arms of snow, “Let me rest in thy bounding ship, far from the love of Corlo. For he, like the thunder of the desart, is terrible to Inibaca. He loves me in the gloom of pride. He shakes ten thousand spears!” “Rest thou in peace,” said the mighty Trenmor, “Rest behind the shield of my fathers. I will not fly from the chief, though he shakes ten thousand spears!” Three days he waited on the shore. He sent his horn abroad. He called Corlo to battle, from all his echoing hills. But Corlo came not to battle. The king of Lochlin descends from his hall. He feasted on the roaring shore. He gave the maid to Trenmor! “King of Lochlin,” said Fingal, “thy blood flows in the veins of thy foe. Our fathers met in battle, because they loved the strife of spears. But often did they feast in the hall: and send round the joy of the shell. Let thy face brighten with gladness, and thine ear delight in the harp. Dreadful as the storm of thine ocean, thou hast poured thy valour forth; thy voice has been like the voice of thousands when they engage in war. Raise, to-morrow, raise thy white sails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca! Bright as the beam of noon, she comes on my mournful soul. I have seen thy tears for the fair one. I spared thee in the halls of Starno; when my sword was red with slaughter: when my eye was full of tears for the maid. Or dost thou chuse the fight? The combat which thy fathers gave to Trenmor is thine! that thou mayest depart renowned, like the sun setting in the west!” “King of the race of Morven,” said the chief of resounding Lochlin! “never will Swaran fight with thee, first of a thousand heroes! I have seen thee in the halls of Starno: few were thy years beyond my own. When shall I, I said to my soul, lift the spear like the noble Fingal? We have fought heretofore, O warrior, on the side of the shaggy Malmor; after my waves had carried me to thy halls, and the feast of a thousand shells was spread. Let the bards send his name who overcame to future years, for noble was the strife of Malmor! But many of the ships of Lochlin have lost their youths on Lena. Take these, thou king of Morven, and be the friend of Swaran! When thy sons shall come to Gormal, the feast of shells shall be spread, and the combat offered on the vale.” “Nor ship,” replied the king, “shall Fingal take, nor land of many hills. The desart is enough to me, with all its deer and woods. Rise on thy waves again, thou noble friend of Agandecca. Spread thy white sails to the beam of the morning; return to the echoing hills of Gormal.” “Blest be thy soul, thou king of shells,” said Swaran of the dark-brown shield. “In peace thou art the gale of spring. In war the mountain-storm. Take now my hand in friendship, king of echoing Selma! Let thy bards mourn those who fell. Let Erin give the sons of Lochlin to earth. Raise high the mossy stones of their fame: that the children of the north hereafter may behold the place where their fathers fought. The hunter may say, when he leans on a mossy tomb, here Fingal and Swaran fought, the heroes of other years. Thus hereafter shall he say, and our fame shall last for ever!” “Swaran,” said the king of hills, “to-day our fame is greatest. We shall pass away like a dream. No sound will remain in our fields of war. Our tombs will be lost in the heath. The hunter shall not know the place of our rest. Our names may be heard in song. What avails it, when our strength hath ceased? O Ossian, Carril, and Ullin, you know of heroes that are no more. Give us the song of other years. Let the night pass away on the sound, and morning return with joy.” We gave the song to the kings. An hundred harps mixed their sound with our voice. The face of Swaran brightened, like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vanish away, and leave her calm and broad, in the midst of the sky! “Where, Carril,” said the great Fingal, “Carril of other times! Where is the son of Semo? the king of the isle of mist? has he retired, like the meteor of death, to the dreary cave of Tura?” “Cuthullin,” said Carril of other times, “lies in the dreary cave of Tura. His hand is on the sword of his strength. His thoughts on the battles he lost. Mournful is the king of spears; till now unconquered in war. He sends his sword to rest on the side of Fingal: For, like the storm of the desert, thou hast scattered all his foes. Take, O Fingal, the sword of the hero. His fame is departed like mist, when it flies, before the rustling wind, along the brightening vale.” “No:” replied the king, “Fingal shall never take his sword. His arm is mighty in war; his fame shall never fail. Many have been overcome in battle; whose renown arose from their fall. O Swaran, king of resounding woods, give all thy grief away. The vanquished, if brave, are renowned. They are like the sun in a cloud, when he hides his face in the south, but looks again on the hills of grass! “Grumal was a chief of Cona. He sought the battle on every coast. His soul rejoiced in blood. His ear in the din of arms. He poured his warriors on Craca; Craca's king met him from his grove: for then, within the circle of Brumo, he spoke to the stone of power. Fierce was the battle of the heroes, for the maid of the breast of snow. The fame of the daughter of Craca had reached Grumal at the streams of Cona: he vowed to have the white-bosomed maid, or die on echoing Craca. Three days they strove together, and Grumal on the fourth was bound. Far from his friends they placed him, in the horrid circle of Brumo, where often, they said, the ghosts of the dead howled round the stone of their fear. But he afterwards shone, like a pillar of the light of heaven. They fell by his mighty hand. Grumal had all his fame!” “Raise, ye bards of other times,” continued the great Fingal, “raise high the praise of heroes: that my soul may settle on their fame; that the mind of Swaran may cease to be sad.” They lay in the heath of Mora. The dark winds rustled over the chiefs. A hundred voices, at once, arose: a hundred harps were strung. They sung of other times; the mighty chiefs of former years! When now shall I hear the bard! When rejoice at the fame of my fathers? The harp is not strung on Morven. The voice of music ascends not on Cona. Dead, with the mighty, is the bard. Fame is in the desart no more.” Morning trembles with the beam of the east; it glimmers on Cromla's side. Over Lena is heard the horn of Swaran. The sons of the ocean gather around. Silent and sad they rise on the wave. The blast of Erin is behind their sails. White, as the mist of Morven, they float along the sea. “Call,” said Fingal, “call my dogs, the long-bounding sons of the chace. Call white-breasted Bran, and the surly strength of Luath! Fillan, and Ryno; but he is not here! My son rests on the bed of death. Fillan and Fergus! blow the horn, that the joy of the chace may arise; that the deer of Cromla may hear, and start at the lake of roes.” The shrill sound spreads along the wood. The sons of heathy Cromla arise. A thousand dogs fly off at once, grey bounding through the heath. A deer fell by every dog; three by the white-breasted Bran. He brought them, in their flight, to Fingal, that the joy of the king might be great! One deer fell at the tomb of Ryno. The grief of Fingal returned. He saw how peaceful lay the stone of him, who was the first at the chace! “No more shalt thou rise, O my son, to partake of the feast of Cromla. Soon will thy tomb be hid, and the grass grow rank on thy grave. The sons of the feeble shall pass along. They shall not know where the mighty lie. “Ossian and Fillan, sons of my strength. Gaul, chief of the blue steel of war! let us ascend the hill to the cave of Tura. Let us find the chief of the battles of Erin. Are these the walls of Tura? grey and lonely they rise on the heath. The chief of shells is sad, and the halls are silent and lonely. Come, let us find Cuthullin, and give him all our joy. But is that Cuthullin, O Fillan, or a pillar of smoke on the heath. The wind of Cromla is on my eyes. I distinguish not my friend.” “Fingal!” replied the youth, “it is the son of Semo! Gloomy and sad is the hero! his hand is on his sword. Hail to the son of battle, breaker of the shields!” “Hail to thee,” replied Cuthullin, “hail to all the sons of Morven! Delightful is thy presence, O Fingal, it is the sun on Cromla; when the hunter mourns his absence for a season, and sees him between the clouds. Thy sons are like stars that attend thy course. They give light in the night. It is not thus thou hast seen me, O Fingal, returning from the wars of thy land: when the kings of the world had fled, and joy returned to the hill of hinds!” “Many are thy words, Cuthullin,” said Connan of small renown. “Thy words are many, son of Semo; but where are thy deeds in arms? Why did we come, over ocean, to aid thy feeble sword! Thou flyest to thy cave of grief, and Connan fights thy battles. Resign to me these arms of light. Yield them, thou chief of Erin!” “No hero,” replied the chief, “ever sought the arms of Cuthullin; and had a thousand heroes sought them, it were in vain, thou gloomy youth! I fled not to the cave of grief, till Erin failed at her streams.” “Youth of the feeble arm,” said Fingal, “Connan, cease thy words! Cuthullin is renowned in battle; terrible over the world. Often have I heard thy fame, thou stormy chief of Inis-fail. Spread now thy white sails for the isle of mist. See Bragela leaning on her rock. Her tender eye is in tears; the winds lift her long hair from her heaving breast. She listens to the breeze of night, to hear the voice of thy rowers; to hear the song of the sea! the sound of thy distant harp!” “Long shall she listen in vain. Cuthullin shall never return! How can I behold Bragela, to raise the sigh of her breast? Fingal, I was always victorious in battles of other spears!” “And hereafter thou shalt be victorious,” said Fingal of generous shells. “The fame of Cuthullin shall grow, like the branchy tree of Cromla. Many battles await thee, O chief! Many shall be the wounds of thy hand! Bring hither, Oscar, the deer! Prepare the feast of shells. Let our souls rejoice after danger, and our friends delight in our presence!” We sat. We feasted. We sung. The soul of Cuthullin rose. The strength of his arm returned. Gladness brightened along his face. Ullin gave the song; Carril raised the voice. I joined the bards, and sung of battles of the spear. Battles! where I often fought. Now I fight no more! The fame of my former deeds is ceased. I sit forlorn at the tombs of my friends! Thus the night passed away in song. We brought back the morning with joy. Fingal arose on the heath, and shook his glittering spear. He moved first toward the plains of Lena. We followed in all our arms. “Spread the sail,” said the king, “seize the winds as they pour from Lena.” We rose on the wave with songs. We rushed, with joy, through the foam of the deep. COMALA: A DRAMATIC POEM. ARGUMENT. This poem is valuable on account of the light it throws on the antiquity of Ossian's compositions. The Caracul mentioned here is the same with Caracalla, the son of Severus, who, in the year 211, commanded an expedition against the Caledonians. The variety of the measure shews that the poem was originally set to music, and perhaps presented before the chiefs upon solemn occasions. Tradition has handed down the story more complete than it is in the poem. “Comala, the daughter of Sarno, king of Inistore, or Orkney islands, fell in love with Fingal, the son of Comhal, at a feast, to which her father had invited him [Fingal, B. III.], upon his return from Lochlin, after the death of Agandecca. Her passion was so violent, that she followed him, disguised like a youth, who wanted to be employed in his wars. She was soon discovered by Hidallan, the son of Lamor, one of Fingal's heroes, whose love she had slighted some time before. Her romantic passion and beauty recommended her so much to the king, that he had resolved to make her his wife; when news was brought him of Caracul's expedition. He marched to stop the progress of the enemy, and Comala attended him. He left her on a hill, within sight of Caracul's army, when he himself went to battle, having previously promised, if he survived, to return that night.” The sequel of the story may be gathered from the poem itself. Macpherson. THE PERSONS. Fingal. Hidallan. Comala. Melilcoma, Daughter of Morni. Dersagrena, Daughter of Morni. Bards. DERSAGRENA. The chace is over The chace is over. No noise on Ardven but the torrent's roar! Daughter of Morni, come from Crona's banks. Lay down the bow, and take the harp. Let the night come on with songs, let our joy be great on Ardven. MELILCOMA. Night comes apace, thou blue-eyed maid; grey night grows dim along the plain. I saw a deer at Crona's stream; a mossy bank he seemed through the gloom; but soon he bounded away. A meteor played round his branching horns! the awful faces of other times looked from the clouds of Crona! DERSAGRENA. These are the signs of Fingal's death. The king of shields is fallen! and Caracul prevails. Rise, Comala, from thy rock; daughter of Sarno, rise in tears. The youth of thy love is low; his ghost is on our hills. MELILCOMA. There Comala sits forlorn! two grey dogs near shake their rough ears, and catch the flying breeze. Her red cheek rests upon her arm; the mountain wind is in her hair. She turns her blue eyes towards the fields of his promise. Where art thou, O Fingal, the night is gathering around? COMALA. O Carun of the streams! why do I behold thy waters rolling in blood? Has the noise of the battle been heard; and sleeps the king of Morven? Rise, moon, thou daughter of the sky! look from between thy clouds; rise, that I may behold the gleam of his steel, on the field of his promise. Or rather let the meteor, that lights our fathers through the night, come, with its red beam, to shew me the way to my fallen hero. Who will defend me from sorrow? Who from the love of Hidallan? Long shall Comala look before she can behold Fingal in the midst of his host; bright as the coming forth of the morning, in the cloud of an early shower. HIDALLAN. Dwell, thou mist of gloomy Crona, dwell on the path of the king. Hide his steps from mine eyes, let me remember my friend no more. The bands of battle are scattered, no crowding tread is round the noise of his steel. O Carun, roll thy streams of blood, the chief of the people is low. COMALA. Who fell on Carun's sounding banks, son of the cloudy night? Was he white as the snow of Ardven? Blooming as the bow of the shower? Was his hair like the mist of the hill, soft and curling in the day of the sun? Was he like the thunder of heaven in battle? Fleet as the roe of the desart? HIDALLAN. O that I might behold his love, fair-leaning from her rock! Her red eye dim in tears, her blushing cheek half hid in her locks! Blow, O gentle breeze, lift thou the heavy locks of the maid, that I may behold her white arm, her lovely cheek in her grief. COMALA. And is the son of Comhal fallen, chief of the mournful tale? The thunder rolls on the hill! The lightning flies on wings of fire! They frighten not Comala; for Fingal is low. Say, chief of the mournful tale, fell the breaker of the shields? HIDALLAN. The nations are scattered on their hills! they shall hear the voice of the king no more. COMALA. Confusion pursue thee over thy plains! Ruin overtake thee, thou king of the world! Few be thy steps to thy grave; and let one virgin mourn thee. Let her be like Comala, tearful in the days of her youth. Why hast thou told me, Hidallan, that my hero fell? I might have hoped a little while his return; I might have thought I saw him on the distant rock; a tree might have deceived me with his appearance; the wind of the hill might have been the sound of his horn in mine ear. O that I were on the banks of Carun! that my tears might be warm on his cheek! HIDALLAN. He lies not on the banks of Carun: on Ardven heroes raise his tomb. Look on them, O moon, from thy clouds; be thy beam bright on his breast, that Comala may behold him in the light of his armour. COMALA. Stop, ye sons of the grave, till I behold my love! He left me at the chace alone. I knew not that he went to war. He said he would return with the night; the king of Morven is returned! Why didst thou not tell me that he would fall, O trembling dweller of the rock. Thou sawest him in the blood of his youth; but thou didst not tell Comala! MELILCOMA. What sound is that on Ardven? Who is that bright in the vale? Who comes like the strength of rivers, when their crowded waters glitter to the moon? COMALA. Who is it but the foe of Comala, the son of the king of the world! Ghost of Fingal! do thou, from thy cloud, direct Comala's bow. Let him fall like the hart of the desart. It is Fingal in the crowd of his ghosts. Why dost thou come, my love, to frighten and please my soul? FINGAL. Raise, ye bards, the song, raise the wars of the streamy Carun! Caracul has fled from our arms along the fields of his pride. He sets far distant like a meteor, that incloses a spirit of night, when the winds drive it over the heath, and the dark woods are gleaming around. I heard a voice, or was it the breeze of my hills? Is it the huntress of Ardven, the white-handed daughter of Sarno? Look from thy rocks, my love; let me hear the voice of Comala. COMALA. Take me to the cave of thy rest, O lovely son of death! FINGAL. Come to the cave of my rest. The storm is past, the sun is on our fields. Come to the cave of my rest, huntress of echoing Ardven! COMALA. He is returned with his fame! I feel the right hand of his wars! But I must rest beside the rock, till my soul returns from my fear! O let the harp be near! raise the song, ye daughters of Morni! DERSAGRENA. Comala has slain three deer on Ardven, the fire ascends on the rock; go to the feast of Comala, king of the woody Morven! FINGAL. Raise, ye sons of song, the wars of the streamy Carun; that my white-handed maid may rejoice: while I behold the feast of my love. BARDS. Roll, streamy Carun, roll in joy; the sons of battle fled! The steed is not seen on our fields; the wings of their pride spread in other lands. The sun will now rise in peace, and the shadows descend in joy. The voice of the chace will be heard: the shields hang in the hall. Our delight will be in the war of the ocean, our hands shall grow red in the blood of Lochlin. Roll, streamy Carun, roll in joy; the sons of battle fled! MELILCOMA. Descend ye light mists from high! Ye moonbeams, lift her soul. Pale lies the maid at the rock! Comala is no more! FINGAL. Is the daughter of Sarno dead; the white-bosomed maid of my love? Meet me, Comala, on my heaths, when I sit alone at the streams of my hills! HIDALLAN. Ceased the voice of the huntress of Ardven? Why did I trouble the soul of the maid? When shall I see thee, with joy, in the chace of the dark-brown hinds? FINGAL. Youth of the gloomy brow! no more shalt thou feast in my halls. Thou shalt not pursue my chace, my foes shall not fall by thy sword. Lead me to the place of her rest, that I may behold her beauty. Pale she lies at the rock, the cold winds lift her hair. Her bow-string sounds in the blast, her arrow was broken in her fall. Raise the praise of the daughter of Sarno! give her name to the winds of heaven! BARDS. See! meteors gleam around the maid! See! moon-beams lift her soul! Around her, from their clouds, bend the awful faces of her fathers; Sarno of the gloomy brow! the red-rolling eyes of Fidallan! When shall thy white hand arise? When shall thy voice be heard on our rocks? The maids shall seek thee on the heath, but they shall not find thee. Thou shalt come, at times, to their dreams, to settle peace in their soul. Thy voice shall remain in their ears; they shall think with joy on the dreams of their rest. Meteors gleam around the maid, and moonbeams lift her soul! THE WAR OF CAROS: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Caros is probably the noted usurper Carausius, by birth a Menapian, who assumed the purple in the year 284: and, seizing on Britain, defeated the Emperor Maximian Herculius in several naval engagements; which gives propriety to his being called, in this poem, the King of Ships. He repaired Agricola's wall, in order to obstruct the incursions of the Caledonians; and when he was employed in that work, it appears he was attacked by a party under the command of Oscar, the son of Ossian. This battle is the foundation of the present poem; which is addressed to Malvina, the daughter of Toscar. Macpherson. Bring, daughter of Toscar, bring the harp! Bring, daughter of Toscar, bring the harp! the light of the song rises in Ossian's soul! It is like the field, when darkness covers the hills around, and the shadow grows slowly on the plain of the sun. I behold my son, O Malvina! near the mossy rock of Crona. But it is the mist of the desert, tinged with the beam of the west! Lovely is the mist that assumes the form of Oscar! turn from it, ye winds, when ye roar on the side of Ardven! Who comes towards my son, with the murmur of a song? His staff is in his hand, his grey hair loose on the wind. Surly joy lightens his face. He often looks back to Caros. It is Ryno of songs, he that went to view the foe. “What does Caros, king of ships?” said the son of the now mournful Ossian, “spreads he the wings of his pride, bard of the times of old?” “He spreads them, Oscar,” replied the bard, “but it is behind his gathered heap. He looks over his stones with fear. He beholds thee terrible, as the ghost of night, that rolls the wave to his ships!” “Go, thou first of my bards,” says Oscar, “take the spear of Fingal. Fix a flame on its point. Shake it to the winds of heaven. Bid him, in songs, to advance, and leave the rolling of his wave. Tell to Caros that I long for battle; that my bow is weary of the chace of Cona. Tell him the mighty are not here; and that my arm is young.” He went with the murmur of songs. Oscar reared his voice on high. It reached his heroes on Ardven, like the noise of a cave; when the sea of Togorma rolls before it: and its trees meet the roaring winds. They gather round my son like the streams of the hill; when, after rain, they roll in the pride of their course. Ryno came to the mighty Caros. He struck his flaming spear. Come to the battle of Oscar, O thou that sittest on the rolling of waves! Fingal is distant far; he hears the songs of bards in Morven: the wind of his hall is in his hair. His terrible spear is at his side; his shield, that is like the darkened moon! Come to the battle of Oscar; the hero is alone! He came not over the streamy Carun. The bard returned with his song. Grey night grows dim on Crona. The feast of shells is spread. A hundred oaks burn to the wind; faint light gleams over the heath. The ghosts of Ardven pass through the beam, and shew their dim and distant forms. Comala is half unseen on her meteor; Hidallan is sullen and dim, like the darkened moon behind the mist of night. “Why art thou sad?” said Ryno; for he alone beheld the chief. “Why art thou sad, Hidallan? hast thou not received thy fame? The songs of Ossian have been heard; thy ghost has brightened in wind, when thou didst bend from thy cloud, to hear the song of Morven's bard!” “And do thine eyes,” said Oscar, “behold the chief, like the dim meteor of night? Say, Ryno, say, how fell Hidallan, the renowned in the days of my fathers? His name remains on the rocks of Cona. I have often seen the streams of his hills!” Fingal, replied the bard, drove Hidallan from his wars. The king's soul was sad for Comala, and his eyes could not behold the chief. Lonely, sad along the heath, he slowly moved, with silent steps. His arms hang disordered on his side. His hair flies loose from his brow. The tear is in his down-cast eyes; a sigh half-silent in his breast! Three days he strayed unseen, alone, before he came to Lamor's halls: the mossy halls of his fathers, at the stream of Balva. There Lamor sat alone beneath a tree; for he had sent his people with Hidallan to war. The stream ran at his feet; his grey head rested on his staff. Sightless are his aged eyes. He hums the song of other times. The noise of Hidallan's feet came to his ear; he knew the tread of his son. “Is the son of Lamor returned? or is it the sound of his ghost? Hast thou fallen on the banks of Carun, son of the aged Lamor? Or, if I hear the sound of Hidallan's feet, where are the mighty in the war? where are my people, Hidallan, that were wont to return with their echoing shields! Have they fallen on the banks of Carun?” “No:” replied the sighing youth, “the people of Lamor live. They are renowned in war, my father; but Hidallan is renowned no more. I must sit alone on the banks of Balva, when the roar of the battle grows.” “But thy fathers never sat alone,” replied the rising pride of Lamor. “They never sat alone on the banks of Balva, when the roar of battle rose. Dost thou not behold that tomb? My eyes discern it not; there rests the noble Garmállon, who never fled from war! Come, thou renowned in battle, he says, come to thy father's tomb. How am I renowned, Garmállon? my son has fled from war!” “King of the streamy Balva!” said Hidallan, with a sigh, “why dost thou torment my soul? Lamor, I never fled. Fingal was sad for Comala; he denied his wars to Hidallan. Go to the grey streams of thy land, he said; moulder like a leafless oak, which the winds have bent over Balva, never more to grow! “And must I hear,” Lamor replied, “the lonely tread of Hidallan's feet? When thousands are renowned in battle, shall he bend over my grey streams? Spirit of the noble Garmállon! carry Lamor to his place; his eyes are dark; his soul is sad; his son has lost his fame!” “Where,” said the youth, “shall I search for fame to gladden the soul of Lamor? From whence shall I return with renown, that the sound of my arms may be pleasant in his ear? If I go to the chace of hinds, my name will not be heard. Lamor will not feel my dogs, with his hands, glad at my arrival from the hill. He will not enquire of his mountains, or of the dark-brown deer of his deserts!” “I must fall,” said Lamor, “like a leafless oak: it grew on a rock! it was overturned by the winds! My ghost will be seen on my hills, mournful for my young Hidallan. Will not ye, ye mists, as ye rise, hide him from my sight? My son! go to Lamor's hall: there the arms of our fathers hang. Bring the sword of Garmállon; he took it from a foe!” He went and brought the sword, with all its studded thongs. He gave it to his father. The grey-haired hero felt the point with his hand. “My son! lead me to Garmállon's tomb; it rises beside that rustling tree. The long grass is withered; I hear the breezes whistling there. A little fountain murmurs near, and sends its water to Balva. There let me rest; it is noon: the sun is on our fields!” He led him to Garmállon's tomb. Lamor pierced the side of his son. They sleep together: their ancient halls moulder away. Ghosts are seen there at noon: the valley is silent, and the people shun the place of Lamor. “Mournful is thy tale,” said Oscar, “son of the times of old! My soul sighs for Hidallan; he fell in the days of his youth. He flies on the blast of the desart, his wandering is in a foreign land. Sons of the echoing Morven! draw near to the foes of Fingal. Send the night away in songs; watch the strength of Caros. Oscar goes to the people of other times; to the shades of silent Ardven; where his fathers sit dim in their clouds, and behold the future war. And art thou there, Hidallan, like a half-extinguished meteor? Come to my sight, in thy sorrow, chief of the winding Balva!” The heroes move with their songs. Oscar slowly ascends the hill. The meteors of night set on the heath before him. A distant torrent faintly roars. Unfrequent blasts rush through aged oaks. The half-enlightened moon sinks dim and red behind her hill. Feeble voices are heard on the heath. Oscar drew his sword! “Come,” said the hero, “O ye ghosts of my fathers! ye that fought against the kings of the world! Tell me the deeds of future times; and your converse in your caves; when you talk together, and behold your sons in the fields of the brave.” Trenmor came, from his hill, at the voice of his mighty son. A cloud, like the steed of the stranger, supported his airy limbs. His robe is of the mist of Lano, that brings death to the people. His sword is a green meteor half-extinguished. His face is without form, and dark. He sighed thrice over the hero: thrice the winds of night roared around! Many were his words to Oscar; but they only came by halves to our ears: they were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of the song arose. He slowly vanished, like a mist that melts on the sunny hill. It was then, O daughter of Toscar, my son began first to be sad. He foresaw the fall of his race. At times he was thoughtful and dark; like the sun when he carries a cloud on his face; but again he looks forth from his darkness on the green hills of Cona. Oscar passed the night among his fathers, grey morning met him on Carun's banks. A green vale surrounded a tomb which arose in the times of old. Little hills lift their heads at a distance; and stretch their old trees to the wind. The warriors of Caros sat there; for they had passed the stream by night. They appeared, like the trunks of aged pines, to the pale light of the morning. Oscar stood at the tomb, and raised thrice his terrible voice. The rocking hills echoed around; the starting roes bounded away: And the trembling ghosts of the dead fled, shrieking on their clouds. So terrible was the voice of my son, when he called his friends! A thousand spears arose around; the people of Caros rose. Why, daughter of Toscar, why that tear? My son, though alone, is brave. Oscar is like a beam of the sky; he turns around and the people fall. His hand is the arm of a ghost, when he stretches it from a cloud; the rest of his thin form is unseen; but the people die in the vale! My son beheld the approach of the foe; he stood in the silent darkness of his strength. “Am I alone,” said Oscar, “in the midst of a thousand foes? Many a spear is there: many a darkly-rolling eye! Shall I fly to Ardven? But did my fathers ever fly? The mark of their arm is in a thousand battles. Oscar, too, shall be renowned! Come, ye dim ghosts of my fathers, and behold my deeds in war! I may fall; but I will be renowned like the race of the echoing Morven.” He stood, growing in his place, like a flood in a narrow vale! The battle came; but they fell: bloody was the sword of Oscar! The noise reached his people at Crona; they came like a hundred streams. The warriors of Caros fled; Oscar remained like a rock left by the ebbing sea. Now dark and deep, with all his steeds, Caros rolled his might along: the little streams are lost in his course; the earth is rocking round. Battle spreads from wing to wing: ten thousand swords gleam at once in the sky. But why should Ossian sing of battles? For never more shall my steel shine in war. I remember the days of my youth with grief; when I feel the weakness of my arm. Happy are they who fell in their youth, in the midst of their renown! They have not beheld the tombs of their friend: or failed to bend the bow of their strength. Happy art thou, O Oscar, in the midst of thy rushing blast. Thou often goest to the fields of thy fame, where Caros fled from thy lifted sword. Darkness comes on my soul, O fair daughter of Toscar, I behold not the form of my son at Carun; nor the figure of Oscar on Crona. The rustling winds have carried him far away; and the heart of his father is sad. But lead me, O Malvina, to the sound of my woods; to the roar of my mountain streams. Let the chace be heard on Cona; let me think on the days of other years. And bring me the harp, O maid, that I may touch it, when the light of my soul shall arise. Be thou near, to learn the song; future times shall hear of me! The sons of the feeble hereafter will lift the voice on Cona; and, looking up to the rocks, say, “Here Ossian dwelt.” They shall admire the chiefs of old, the race that are no more! while we ride on our clouds, Malvina, on the wings of the roaring winds. Our voices shall be heard, at times, in the desert; we shall sing on the breeze of the rock. THE WAR OF INIS-THONA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Reflections on the poet's youth. An apostrophe to Selma. Oscar obtains leave to go to Inis-thona, an island of Scandinavia. The mournful story of Argon and Ruro, the two sons of the king of Inis-thona. Oscar revenges their death, and returns in triumph to Selma. A soliloquy by the poet himself. Macpherson. Our youth is like the dream of the hunter Our youth is like the dream of the hunter on the hill of heath. He sleeps in the mild beams of the sun; he awakes amidst a storm; the red lightning flies around: trees shake their heads to the wind! He looks back, with joy, on the day of the sun, and the pleasant dreams of his rest! When shall Ossian's youth return? When his ear delight in the sound of arms? When shall I, like Oscar, travel in the light of my steel! Come, with your streams, ye hills of Cona! listen to the voice of Ossian. The song rises, like the sun, in my soul. I feel the joys of other times! I behold thy towers, O Selma! the oaks of thy shaded wall: thy streams sound in my ear; thy heroes gather around. Fingal sits in the midst. He leans on the shield of Trenmor: his spear stands against the wall; he listens to the song of his bards. The deeds of his arm are heard; the actions of the king in his youth! Oscar had returned from the chace, and heard the hero's praise. He took the shield of Branno from the wall; his eyes were filled with tears. Red was the cheek of youth. His voice was trembling, low. My spear shook its bright head in his hand: he spoke to Morven's king. “Fingal! thou king of heroes! Ossian, next to him in war! ye have fought in your youth; your names are renowned in song. Oscar is like the mist of Cona; I appear, and I vanish away: The bard will not know my name. The hunter will not search in the heath for my tomb. Let me fight, O heroes, in the battle of Inis-thona. Distant is the land of my war! ye shall not hear of Oscar's fall! Some bard may find me there; some bard may give my name to song. The daughter of the stranger shall see my tomb, and weep over the youth, that came from afar. The bard shall say, at the feast, “Hear the song of Oscar from the distant land!” “Oscar,” replied the king of Morven, “thou shalt fight, son of my fame! Prepare my dark-bosomed ship to carry my hero to Inis-thona. Son of my son, regard our fame; thou art of the race of renown! Let not the children of strangers say, feeble are the sons of Morven! Be thou, in battle, a roaring storm; mild as the evening sun in peace! Tell, Oscar, to Inis-thona's king, that Fingal remembers his youth; when we strove in the combat together, in the days of Agandecca.” They lifted up the sounding sail; the wind whistled through the thongs of their masts. Waves lash the oozy rocks; the strength of ocean roars. My son beheld, from the wave, the land of groves. He rushed into Runa's sounding bay, and sent his sword to Annir of spears. The grey-haired hero rose, when he saw the sword of Fingal. His eyes were full of tears; he remembered his battles in youth. Twice had they lifted the spear, before the lovely Agandecca: heroes stood far distant, as if two spirits were striving in winds. “But now,” began the king, “I am old; the sword lies useless in my hall. Thou, who art of Morven's race! Annir has seen the battle of spears; but now he is pale and withered, like the oak of Lano. I have no son to meet thee with joy, to bring thee to the halls of his fathers. Argon is pale in the tomb, and Ruro is no more. My daughter is in the hall of strangers: she longs to behold my tomb. Her spouse shakes ten thousand spears; he comes, a cloud of death from Lano. Come, to share the feast of Annir, son of echoing Morven!” Three days they feasted together; on the fourth Annir heard the name of Oscar. They rejoiced in the shell. They pursued the boars of Runa. Beside the fount of mossy stones, the weary heroes rest. The tear steals in secret from Annir: he broke the rising sigh. “Here darkly rest,” the hero said, “the children of my youth. This stone is the tomb of Ruro; that tree sounds over the grave of Argon. Do ye hear my voice, O my sons, within your narrow house? Or do ye speak in these rustling leaves, when the winds of the desert rise?” “King of Inis-thona,” said Oscar, “how fell the children of youth? The wild boar rushes over their tombs, but he does not disturb their repose. They pursue deer formed of clouds, and bend their airy bow. They still love the sport of their youth; and mount the wind with joy.” “Cormalo,” replied the king, “is a chief of ten thousand spears. He dwells at the waters of Lano, which send forth the vapour of death. He came to Runa's echoing halls, and sought the honour of the spear. The youth was lovely as the first beam of the sun; few were they who could meet him in fight! My heroes yielded to Cormalo: my daughter was seized in his love. Argon and Ruro returned from the chace; the tears of their pride descend: they roll their silent eyes on Runa's heroes, who had yielded to a stranger. Three days they feasted with Cormalo: on the fourth young Argon fought. But who could fight with Argon! Cormalo is overcome. His heart swelled with the grief of pride; he resolved, in secret, to behold the death of my sons. They went to the hills of Runa: they pursued the dark-brown hinds. The arrow of Cormalo flew in secret: my children fell in blood. He came to the maid of his love; to Inis-thona's long-haired maid. They fled over the desert. Annir remained alone. Night came on, and day appeared; nor Argon's voice, nor Ruro's came. At length their much-loved dog was seen; the fleet and bounding Runar. He came into the hall and howled; and seemed to look toward the place of their fall. We followed him: we found them here: we laid them by this mossy stream. This is the haunt of Annir, when the chace of the hinds is past. I bend like the trunk of an aged oak; my tears for ever flow!” “O Ronnan!” said the rising Oscar, “Ogar, king of spears! call my heroes to my side, the sons of streamy Morven. To-day we go to Lano's water, that sends forth the vapour of death. Cormalo will not long rejoice: death is often at the point of our swords!” They came over the desert like stormy clouds, when the winds roll them along the heath: their edges are tinged with lightning; the echoing groves foresee the storm! The horn of Oscar's battle is heard; Lano shook over all its waves. The children of the lake convened around the sounding shield of Cormalo. Oscar fought, as he was wont in war. Cormalo fell beneath his sword: the sons of dismal Lano fled to their secret vales! Oscar brought the daughter of Inis-thona to Annir's echoing halls. The face of age is bright with joy; he blest the king of swords! How great was the joy of Ossian, when he beheld the distant sail of his son! it was like a cloud of light that rises in the east, when the traveller is sad in a land unknown; and dismal night, with her ghosts, is sitting around in shades! We brought him, with songs, to Selma's halls. Fingal spread the feast of shells. A thousand bards raised the name of Oscar: Morven answered to the sound. The daughter of Toscar was there; her voice was like the harp; when the distant sound comes, in the evening, on the soft-rustling breeze of the vale! O lay me, ye that see the light, near some rock of my hills! let the thick hazels be around, let the rustling oak be near. Green be the place of my rest; let the sound of the distant torrent be heard. Daughter of Toscar, take the harp, and raise the lovely song of Selma; that sleep may overtake my soul in the midst of joy; that the dreams of my youth may return, and the days of the mighty Fingal. Selma! I behold thy towers, thy trees, thy shaded wall! I see the heroes of Morven; I hear the song of bards! Oscar lifts the sword of Cormalo; a thousand youths admire its studded thongs. They look with wonder on my son: They admire the strength of his arm. They mark the joy of his father's eyes; they long for an equal fame. And ye shall have your fame, O sons of streamy Morven! My soul is often brightened with song; I remember the friends of my youth. But sleep descends, in the sound of the harp! pleasant dreams begin to rise! Ye sons of the chace, stand far distant, nor disturb my rest. The bard of other times holds discourse with his fathers, the chiefs of the days of old! Sons of the chace, stand far distant! disturb not the dreams of Ossian! THE BATTLE OF LORA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Fingal, on his return from Ireland, after he had expelled Swaran from that kingdom, made a feast to all his heroes: he forgot to invite Ma-ronnan and Aldo, two chiefs, who had not been along with him in his expedition. They resented his neglect; and went over to Erragon, king of Sora, a country of Scandinavia, the declared enemy of Fingal. The valour of Aldo soon gained him a great reputation in Sora: and Lorma, the beautiful wife of Erragon, fell in love with him. He found means to escape with her, and to come to Fingal, who resided then in Selma on the western coast. Erragon invaded Scotland, and was slain in battle by Gaul, the son of Morni, after he had rejected the terms of peace offered him by Fingal. In this war Aldo fell, in a single combat, by the hands of his rival Erragon; and the unfortunate Lorma afterwards died of grief. Macpherson. Son of the distant land Son of the distant land, who dwellest in the secret cell! do I hear the sound of thy grove? or is it thy voice of songs? The torrent was loud in my ear; but I heard a tuneful voice. Dost thou praise the chiefs of thy land: or the spirits of the wind? But, lonely dweller of rocks! look thou on that heathy plain. Thou seest green tombs, with their rank whistling grass: With their stones of mossy heads. Thou seest them, son of the rock; but Ossian's eyes have failed. A mountain-stream comes roaring down, and sends its waters round a green hill. Four mossy stones, in the midst of withered grass, rear their heads on the top. Two trees, which the storms have bent, spread their whistling branches around. This is thy dwelling, Erragon; this thy narrow house: the sound of thy shells have been long forgot in Sora. Thy shield is become dark in thy hall. Erragon, king of ships! chief of distant Sora! how hast thou fallen on our mountains? How is the mighty low? Son of the secret cell! dost thou delight in songs? Hear the battle of Lora. The sound of its steel is long since past. So thunder on the darkened hill roars, and is no more. The sun returns with his silent beams. The glittering rocks, and green heads of the mountains, smile! The bay of Cona received our ships from Erin's rolling waves. Our white sheets hung loose to the masts. The boisterous winds roared behind the groves of Morven. The horn of the king is sounded; the deer start from their rocks. Our arrows flew in the woods. The feast of the hill is spread. Our joy was great on our rocks, for the fall of the terrible Swaran. Two heroes were forgot at our feast. The rage of their bosoms burned. They rolled their red eyes in secret. The sigh bursts from their breasts. They were seen to talk together, and to throw their spears on earth. They were two dark clouds, in the midst of our joy; like pillars of mist on the settled sea. They glitter to the sun; but the mariners fear a storm. “Raise my white sails,” said Maronnan, “raise them to the winds of the west. Let us rush, O Aldo, through the foam of the northern wave. We are forgot at the feast: but our arms have been red in blood. Let us leave the hills of Fingal, and serve the king of Sora. His countenance is fierce. War darkens around his spear. Let us be renowned, O Aldo, in the battles of other lands!” They took their swords, their shields of thongs. They rushed to Lumar's resounding bay. They came to Sora's haughty king, the chief of bounding steeds. Erragon had returned from the chace. His spear was red in blood. He bent his dark face to the ground; and whistled as he went. He took the strangers to his feasts: they fought and conquered in his wars. Aldo returned with his fame towards Sora's lofty walls. From her tower looked the spouse of Erragon, the humid, rolling eyes of Lorma. Her yellow hair flies on the wind of ocean. Her white breast heaves, like snow on heath; when the gentle winds arise, and slowly move it in the light. She saw young Aldo, like the beam of Sora's setting sun. Her soft heart sighed. Tears filled her eyes. Her white arm supported her head. Three days she sat within the hall, and covered her grief with joy. On the fourth she fled with the hero, along the troubled sea. They came to Cona's mossy towers, to Fingal king of spears. “Aldo, of the heart of pride!” said Fingal, rising in wrath: “shall I defend thee from the rage of Sora's injured king? Who will now receive my people into their halls? Who will give the feast of strangers, since Aldo, of the little soul, has dishonoured my name in Sora? Go to thy hills, thou feeble hand. Go: hide thee in thy caves. Mournful is the battle we must fight, with Sora's gloomy king. Spirit of the noble Trenmor! When will Fingal cease to fight? I was born in the midst of battles, and my steps must move in blood to the tomb. But my hand did not injure the weak, my steel did not touch the feeble in arms. I behold thy tempests, O Morven, which will overturn my halls; when my children are dead in battle, and none remains to dwell in Selma. Then will the feeble come, but they will not know my tomb. My renown is only in song. My deeds shall be as a dream to future times!” His people gathered around Erragon, as the storms round the ghost of night; when he calls them, from the top of Morven, and prepares to pour them on the land of the stranger. He came to the shore of Cona. He sent his bard to the king; to demand the combat of thousands; or the land of many hills! Fingal sat in his hall with the friends of his youth around him. The young heroes were at the chace, far distant in the desert. The grey-haired chiefs talked of other times; of the actions of their youth; when the aged Nartmor came, the chief of streamy Lora. “This is no time,” said Nartmor, “to hear the songs of other years: Erragon frowns on the coast, and lifts ten thousand swords. Gloomy is the king among his chiefs! he is like the darkened moon, amidst the meteors of night; when they sail along her skirts, and give the light that has failed o'er her orb.” “Come,” said Fingal, “from thy hall, come, daughter of my love: come from thy hall, Bosmina, maid of streamy Morven! Nartmor, take the steeds of the strangers. Attend the daughter of Fingal! Let her bid the king of Sora to our feast, to Selma's shaded wall. Offer him, O Bosmina, the peace of heroes, and the wealth of generous Aldo. Our youths are far distant. Age is on our trembling hands!” She came to the host of Erragon, like a beam of light to a cloud. In her right hand was seen a sparkling shell. In her left, an arrow of gold. The first, the joyful mark of peace! The latter the sign of war. Erragon brightened in her presence as a rock, before the sudden beams of the sun; when they issue from a broken cloud, divided by the roaring wind! “Son of the distant Sora,” began the mildly blushing maid, “come to the feast of Morven's king, to Selma's shaded walls. Take the peace of heroes, O warrior! Let the dark sword rest by thy side. Chusest thou the wealth of kings? Then hear the words of generous Aldo. He gives to Erragon an hundred steeds, the children of the rein; an hundred maids from distant lands; an hundred hawks with fluttering wing, that fly across the sky. An hundred girdles shall also be thine, to bind high-bosomed maids. The friends of the births of heroes. The cure of the sons of toil. Ten shells, studded with gems, shall shine in Sora's towers: the bright water trembles on their stars, and seems to be sparkling wine. They gladdened once the kings of the world, in the midst of their echoing halls. These, O hero, shall be thine; or thy white-bosomed spouse. Lorma shall roll her bright eyes in thy halls; though Fingal loves the generous Aldo: Fingal! who never injured a hero, though his arm is strong!” “Soft voice of Cona!” replied the king, “tell him, he spreads his feast in vain. Let Fingal pour his spoils around me. Let him bend beneath my power. Let him give me the swords of his fathers: the shields of other times; that my children may behold them in my halls, and say, “These are the arms of Fingal.” “Never shall they behold them in thy halls!” said the rising pride of the maid; “they are in the hands of heroes, who never yielded in war. King of echoing Sora! the storm is gathering on our hills. Dost thou not foresee the fall of thy people, son of the distant land?” She came to Selma's silent halls. The king beheld her down-cast eyes. He rose from his place, in his strength. He shook his aged locks. He took the sounding mail of Trenmor. The dark-brown shield of his fathers. Darkness filled Selma's hall, when he stretched his hand to his spear: the ghosts of thousands were near, and foresaw the death of the people. Terrible joy rose in the face of the aged heroes. They rushed to meet the foe. Their thoughts are on the deeds of other years; and on the fame that rises from death! Now at Trathal's ancient tomb the dogs of the chace appeared. Fingal knew that his young heroes followed. He stopt in the midst of his course. Oscar appeared the first; then Morni's son, and Némi's race. Fercuth shewed his gloomy form. Dermid spread his dark hair on wind. Ossian came the last. I hummed the song of other times. My spear supported my steps over the little streams. My thoughts were of mighty men. Fingal struck his bossy shield; and gave the dismal sign of war. A thousand swords, at once unsheathed, gleam on the waving heath. Three grey-haired sons of song raise the tuneful, mournful voice. Deep and dark, with sounding steps, we rush, a gloomy ridge, along; like the shower of a storm, when it pours on a narrow vale. The king of Morven sat on his hill. The sunbeam of battle flew on the wind. The friends of his youth are near, with all their waving locks of age. Joy rose in the hero's eyes when he beheld his sons in war; when he saw us amidst the lightning of swords, mindful of the deeds of our fathers. Erragon came on, in his strength, like the roar of a winter stream. The battle falls around his steps: death dimly stalks along by his side! “Who comes,” said Fingal, “like the bounding roe, like the hart of echoing Cona? His shield glitters on his side. The clang of his armour is mournful. He meets with Erragon in the strife! Behold the battle of the chiefs! It is like the contending of ghosts in a gloomy storm. But fallest thou, son of the hill; and is thy white bosom stained with blood? Weep, unhappy Lorma, Aldo is no more!” The king took the spear of his strength. He was sad for the fall of Aldo. He bent his deathful eyes on the foe: but Gaul met the king of Sora. Who can relate the fight of the chiefs? The mighty stranger fell! “Sons of Cona!” Fingal cried aloud, “stop the hand of death. Mighty was he that is low. Much is he mourned in Sora! The stranger will come towards his hall, and wonder why it is so silent. The king is fallen, O stranger. The joy of his house is ceased. Listen to the sound of his woods. Perhaps his ghost is murmuring there! But he is far distant, on Morven, beneath the sword of a foreign foe.” Such were the words of Fingal, when the bard raised the song of peace. We stopped our uplifted swords. We spared the feeble foe. We laid Erragon in a tomb. I raised the voice of grief. The clouds of night came rolling down. The ghost of Erragon appeared to some. His face was cloudy and dark; an half-formed sigh is in his breast. “Blest be thy soul, O king of Sora! thine arm was terrible in war!” Lorma sat in Aldo's hall. She sat at the light of a flaming oak. The night came down; but he did not return. The soul of Lorma is sad! “What detains thee, hunter of Cona? Thou didst promise to return. Has the deer been distant far? do the dark winds sigh round thee on the heath? I am in the land of strangers; where is my friend, but Aldo? Come from thy sounding hills, O my best beloved!” Her eyes are turned toward the gate. She listens to the rustling blast. She thinks it is Aldo's tread. Joy rises in her face! But sorrow returns again, like a thin cloud on the moon. “Wilt thou not return, my love! Let me behold the face of the hill. The moon is in the east. Calm and bright is the breast of the lake! When shall I behold his dogs, returning from the chace? When shall I hear his voice, loud and distant on the wind? Come from thy sounding hills, hunter of woody Cona!” His thin ghost appeared on a rock, like a watry beam of feeble light: When the moon rushes sudden from between two clouds, and the midnight shower is on the field! She followed the empty form over the heath. She knew that her hero fell. I heard her approaching cries on the wind, like the mournful voice of the breeze, when it sighs on the grass of the cave! She came. She found her hero! Her voice was heard no more. Silent she rolled her eyes. She was pale, and wildly sad! Few were her days on Cona. She sunk into the tomb. Fingal commanded his bards; they sung over the death of Lorma. The daughters of Morven mourned her, for one day in the year, when the dark winds of autumn returned! Son of the distant land! Thou dwellest in the field of fame! O let thy song arise, at times, in praise of those who fell. Let their thin ghosts rejoice around thee; and the soul of Lorma come on a feeble beam: when thou liest down to rest, and the moon looks into thy cave. Then shalt thou see her lovely; but the tear is still on her cheek! CONLATH AND CUTHONA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Conlath was the youngest of Morni's sons, and brother to the celebrated Gaul. He was in love with Cuthona, the daughter of Rumar, when Toscar, the son of Kinfena, accompanied by Fercuth, his friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora, where Conlath dwelt. He was hospitably received; and, according to the custom of the times, feasted three days with Conlath. On the fourth he set sail, and, coasting the island of waves (Ithona), one of the Hebrides, he saw Cuthona hunting, fell in love with her, and carried her away, by force, in his ship. He was forced, by stress of weather, into I-thona, a desert isle. In the mean time, Conlath, hearing of the rape, sailed after him, and found him on the point of sailing for the coast of Ireland. They fought, and they and their followers fell by mutual wounds. Cuthona did not long survive; for she died of grief the third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfortunate death, sent Stormal, the son of Moran, to bury them, but forgot to send a bard to sing the funeral song over their tombs. The ghost of Conlath comes, long after, to Ossian, to intreat him to transmit to posterity his and Cuthona's fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the souls of the deceased were not happy till their elegies were composed by a bard. Macpherson. Did not Ossian hear a voice? Did not Ossian hear a voice? or is it the sound of days that are no more? Often does the memory of former times come, like the evening sun, on my soul. The noise of the chace is renewed. In thought I lift the spear. But Ossian did hear a voice! Who art thou, son of night? The children of the feeble are asleep. The midnight wind is in my hall. Perhaps it is the shield of Fingal that echoes to the blast. It hangs in Ossian's hall. He feels it sometimes with his hands. Yes! I hear thee, my friend! Long has thy voice been absent from mine ear! What brings thee, on thy cloud, to Ossian, son of generous Morni? Are the friends of the aged near thee? Where is Oscar, son of fame? He was often near thee, O Conlath, when the sound of battle arose. GHOST OF CONLATH. Sleeps the sweet voice of Cona, in the midst of his rustling hall? Sleeps Ossian in his hall, and his friends without their fame? The sea rolls round dark I-thona. Our tombs are not seen in our isle. How long shall our fame be unheard, son of resounding Selma? OSSIAN. O that mine eyes could behold thee! Thou sittest, dim, on thy cloud! Art thou like the mist of Lano? An half-extinguished meteor of fire? Of what are the skirts of thy robe? Of what is thine airy bow? He is gone on his blast, like the shade of a wandering cloud. Come from thy wall, O harp! Let me hear thy sound. Let the light of memory rise on I-thona. Let me behold again my friends! And Ossian does behold his friends, on the dark-blue isle. The cave of Thona appears, with its mossy rocks and bending trees. A stream roars at its mouth. Toscar bends over its course. Fercuth is sad by his side. Cuthóna sits at a distance, and weeps. Does the wind of the waves deceive me? Or do I hear them speak? TOSCAR. The night was stormy. From their hills the groaning oaks came down. The sea darkly-tumbled beneath the blast. The roaring waves climbed against our rocks. The lightning came often and shewed the blasted fern. Fercuth! I saw the ghost who embroiled the night. Silent he stood, on that bank. His robe of mist flew on the wind. I could behold his tears. An aged man he seemed, and full of thought! FERCUTH. It was thy father, O Toscar. He foresees some death among his race. Such was his appearance on Cromla, before the great Maronnan fell. Erin of hills of grass! how pleasant are thy vales! Silence is near thy blue streams. The sun is on thy fields. Soft is the sound of the harp in Seláma. Lovely the cry of the hunter on Cromla. But we are in dark I-thona, surrounded by the storm. The billows lift their white heads above our rocks. We tremble amidst the night. TOSCAR. Whither is the soul of battle fled, Fercuth, with locks of age? I have seen thee undaunted in danger: thine eyes burning with joy in the fight. Whither is the soul of battle fled? Our fathers never feared. Go; view the settling sea: the stormy wind is laid. The billows still tremble on the deep. They seem to fear the blast. Go; view the settling sea. Morning is grey on our rocks. The sun will look soon from his east; in all his pride of light! I lifted up my sails, with joy, before the halls of generous Conlath. My course was by a desert isle: where Cuthona pursued the deer. I saw her, like that beam of the sun that issues from the cloud. Her hair was on her heaving breast. She, bending forward, drew the bow. Her white arm seemed, behind her, like the snow of Cromla. Come to my soul, I said, huntress of the desert isle! But she wastes her time in tears. She thinks of the generous Conlath. Where can I find thy peace, Cuthona, lovely maid! CU-THONA. A distant steep bends over the sea, with aged trees and mossy rocks. The billow rolls at its feet. On its side is the dwelling of roes. The people call it Mora. There the towers of my love arise. There Conlath looks over the sea for his only love. The daughters of the chace returned. He beheld their downcast eyes. “Where is the daughter of Rumar?” But they answered not. My peace dwells on Mora, son of the distant land! TOSCAR. Cuthona shall return to her peace; to the towers of generous Conlath. He is the friend of Toscar! I have feasted in his halls! Rise, ye gentle breezes of Erin. Stretch my sails toward Mora's shores. Cuthona shall rest on Mora: but the days of Toscar must be sad. I shall sit in my cave in the field of the sun. The blast will rustle in my trees. I shall think it is Cuthona's voice. But she is distant far, in the halls of the mighty Conlath! CUTHONA. Ha! what cloud is that? It carries the ghosts of my fathers. I see the skirts of their robes, like grey and watry mist. When shall I fall, O Rumar? Sad Cuthona foresees her death. Will not Conlath behold me, before I enter the narrow house? OSSIAN. He shall behold thee, O maid. He comes along the heaving sea. The death of Toscar is dark on his spear. A wound is in his side! He is pale at the cave of Thona. He shews his ghastly wound. Where art thou with thy tears, Cuthona? The chief of Mora dies. The vision grows dim on my mind. I behold the chiefs no more! But, O ye bards of future times, remember the fall of Conlath with tears. He fell before his day. Sadness darkened in his hall. His mother looked to his shield on the wall, and it was bloody! She knew that her hero fell. Her sorrow was heard on Mora. Art thou pale on thy rock, Cuthona, beside the fallen chiefs? Night comes, and day returns; but none appears to raise their tomb. Thou frightenest the screaming fowls away. Thy tears for ever flow. Thou art pale as a watry cloud, that rises from a lake! The sons of green Selma came. They found Cuthona cold. They raised a tomb over the heroes. She rests at the side of Conlath. Come not to my dreams, O Conlath! Thou hast received thy fame. Be thy voice far distant from my hall, that sleep may descend at night. O that I could forget my friends; till my footsteps should cease to be seen! till I come among them with joy! and lay my aged limbs in the narrow house! CARTHON: A POEM. ARGUMENT. This poem is complete, and the subject of it, as of most of Ossian's compositions, tragical. In the time of Comhal, the son of Trathal, and father of the celebrated Fingal, Clessammor, the son of Thaddu, and brother of Morna, Fingal's mother, was driven by a storm into the river Clyde, on the banks of which stood Balclutha, a town belonging to the Britons between the walls. He was hospitably received by Reuthamir, the principal man in the place, who gave him Moina, his only daughter, in marriage. Reuda, the son of Cormo, a Briton who was in love with Moina, came to Reuthamir's house, and behaved haughtily towards Clessammor. A quarrel ensued, in which Reuda was killed; the Britons, who attended him, pressed so hard on Clessammor, that he was obliged to throw himself into the Clyde, and swim to his ship. He hoisted sail; and the wind being favourable, bore him out to sea. He often endeavoured to return, and carry off his beloved Moina by night; but the wind continuing contrary, he was forced to desist. Moina, who had been left with child by her husband, brought forth a son, and died soon after.—Reuthamir named the child Carthon, i. e. the murmur of waves, from the storm which carried off Clessammor, his father, who was supposed to have been cast away. When Carthon was three years old, Comhal, the father of Fingal, in one of his expeditions against the Britons, took and burnt Balclutha. Reuthamir was killed in the attack; and Carthon was carried safe away by his nurse, who fled farther into the country of the Britons. Carthon, coming to man's estate, was resolved to revenge the fall of Balclutha on Comhal's posterity. He set sail from the Clyde, and falling on the coast of Morven, defeated two of Fingal's heroes, who came to oppose his progress. He was, at last, unwittingly killed by his father Clessammor, in a single combat. This story is the foundation of the present poem, which opens on the night preceding the death of Carthon, so that what passed before is introduced by way of episode. The poem is addressed to Malvina, the daughter of Toscar. Macpherson. A tale of the times of old! A tale of the times of old! The deeds of days of other years! The murmur of thy streams, O Lora, brings back the memory of the past. The sound of thy woods, Garmallar, is lovely in mine ear. Dost thou not behold, Malvina, a rock with its head of heath? Three aged pines bend from its face; green is the narrow plain at its feet; there the flower of the mountain grows, and shakes its white head in the breeze. The thistle is there alone, shedding its aged beard. Two stones, half sunk in the ground, shew their heads of moss. The deer of the mountain avoids the place; for he beholds a dim ghost standing there. The mighty lie, O Malvina, in the narrow plain of the rock. A tale of the times of old! the deeds of days of other years! Who comes from the land of strangers, with his thousands around him? the sun-beam pours its bright stream before him; his hair meets the wind of his hills. His face is settled from war. He is calm, as the evening beam that looks from the cloud of the west, on Cona's silent vale. Who is it but Comhal's son, the king of mighty deeds! He beholds his hills with joy, he bids a thousand voices rise. “Ye have fled over your fields, ye sons of the distant land! The king of the world sits in his hall, and hears of his people's flight. He lifts his red eye of pride; he takes his father's sword. Ye have fled over your fields, sons of the distant land!” Such were the words of the bards, when they came to Selma's halls. A thousand lights from the strangers' land arose, in the midst of the people. The feast is spread around; the night passed away in joy. “Where is the noble Clessammor?” said the fair-haired Fingal. “Where is the brother of Morna, in the hour of my joy? Sullen and dark he passes his days in the vale of echoing Lora: but, behold, he comes from the hill, like a steed in his strength, who finds his companions in the breeze; and tosses his bright mane in the wind. Blessed be the soul of Clessammor: Why so long from Selma?” “Returns the chief,” said Clessammor, “in the midst of his fame? Such was the renown of Comhal in the battles of his youth. Often did we pass over Carun to the land of the strangers: our swords returned, not unstained with blood: nor did the kings of the world rejoice. Why do I remember the times of our war? My hair is mixed with grey. My hand forgets to bend the bow: I lift a lighter spear. O that my joy would return, as when I first beheld the maid; the white-bosomed daughter of strangers, Moina, with the dark-blue eyes!” “Tell,” said the mighty Fingal, “the tale of thy youthful days. Sorrow, like a cloud on the sun, shades the soul of Clessammor. Mournful are thy thoughts, alone, on the banks of the roaring Lora. Let us hear the sorrow of thy youth, and the darkness of thy days!” “It was in the days of peace,” replied the great Clessammor, “I came, in my bounding ship, to Balclutha's wall of towers. The winds had roared behind my sails, and Clutha's streams received my dark-bosomed ship. Three days I remained in Reuthámir's halls, and saw his daughter, that beam of light. The joy of the shell went round, and the aged hero gave the fair. Her breasts were like foam on the wave, and her eyes like stars of light: her hair was dark as the raven's wing: her soul was generous and mild. My love for Moina was great: my heart poured forth in joy. “The son of a stranger came; a chief who loved the white-bosomed Moina. His words were mighty in the hall; he often half-unsheathed his sword. Where, said he, is the mighty Comhal, the restless wanderer of the heath? Comes he, with his host, to Balclutha, since Clessammor is so bold? My soul, I replied, O warrior! burns in a light of its own. I stand without fear in the midst of thousands, though the valiant are distant far. Stranger! thy words are mighty; for Clessammor is alone. But my sword trembles by my side, and longs to glitter in my hand. Speak no more of Comhal, son of the winding Clutha! “The strength of his pride arose. We fought; he fell beneath my sword. The banks of Clutha heard his fall; a thousand spears glittered around. I fought: the strangers prevailed: I plunged into the stream of Clutha. My white sails rose over the waves, and I bounded on the dark-blue sea. Moina came to the shore, and rolled the red eye of her tears: her loose hair flew on the wind; and I heard her mournful, distant cries. Often did I turn my ship! but the winds of the east prevailed. Nor Clutha ever since have I seen, nor Moina of the dark brown hair. She fell in Balchuta; for I have seen her ghost. I knew her as she came through the dusky night, along the murmur of Lora: she was like the new moon, seen through the gathered mist: when the sky pours down its flaky snow, and the world is silent and dark. Raise, ye bards, said the mighty Fingal, the praise of unhappy Moina. Call her ghost, with your songs, to our hills; that she may rest with the fair of Morven, the sun-beams of other days, the delight of heroes of old. I have seen the walls of Balclutha, but they were desolate. The fire had resounded in the halls: and the voice of the people is heard no more. The stream of Clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls. The thistle shook, there, its lonely head: the moss whistled to the wind. The fox looked out, from the windows, the rank grass of the wall waved round its head. Desolate is the dwelling of Moina, silence is in the house of her fathers. Raise the song of mourning, O bards, over the land of strangers. They have but fallen before us: for, one day, we must fall. Why dost thou build the hall, son of the winged days? Thou lookest from thy towers to-day; yet a few years, and the blast of the desart comes; it howls in thy empty court, and whistles round thy half-worn shield. And let the blast of the desart come, we shall be renowned in our day! The mark of my arm shall be in battle; my name in the song of bards. Raise the song; send round the shell: let joy be heard in my hall. When thou, sun of heaven, shalt fail! if thou shalt fail, thou mighty light! if thy brightness is for a season, like Fingal, our fame shall survive thy beams! Such was the song of Fingal, in the day of his joy. His thousand bards leaned forward from their seats, to hear the voice of the king. It was like the music of harps on the gale of the spring. Lovely were thy thoughts, O Fingal! why had not Ossian the strength of thy soul? But thou standest alone, my father! who can equal the king of Selma? The night passed away in song; morning returned in joy. The mountains shewed their grey heads; the blue face of ocean smiled. The white wave is seen tumbling round the distant rock; a mist rose, slowly, from the lake. It came, in the figure of an aged man, along the silent plain. Its large limbs did not move in steps; for a ghost supported it in mid air. It came towards Selma's hall, and dissolved in a shower of blood. The king alone beheld the sight; he foresaw the death of the people. He came, in silence, to his hall; and took his father's spear. The mail rattled on his breast. The heroes rose around. They looked, in silence, on each other, marking the eyes of Fingal. They saw battle in his face: the death of armies on his spear. A thousand shields, at once, are placed on their arms; they drew a thousand swords. The hall of Selma brightened around. The clang of arms ascends. The grey dogs howl in their place. No word is among the mighty chiefs. Each marked the eyes of the king; and half assumed his spear. “Sons of Morven,” begun the king, “this is no time to fill the shell. The battle darkens near us; death hovers over the land. Some ghost, the friend of Fingal, has forewarned us of the foe. The sons of the stranger come from the darkly-rolling sea. For, from the water, came the sign of Morven's gloomy danger. Let each assume his heavy spear, each gird on his father's sword. Let the dark helmet rise on every head; the mail pour its lightening from every side. The battle gathers like a storm; soon shall ye hear the roar of death.” The hero moved on before his host, like a cloud before a ridge of green fire; when it pours on the sky of night, and mariners foresee a storm. On Cona's rising heath they stood: the white-bosomed maids beheld them above like a grove; they foresaw the death of the youth, and looked towards the sea with fear. The white wave deceived them for distant sails; the tear is on their cheek! The sun rose on the sea, and we beheld a distant fleet. Like the mist of ocean they came: and poured their youth upon the coast. The chief was among them, like the stag in the midst of the herd. His shield is studded with gold; stately strode the king of spears. He moved towards Selma; his thousands moved behind. “Go, with a song of peace,” said Fingal, “go, Ullin, to the king of swords. Tell him that we are mighty in war; that the ghosts of our foes are many. But renowned are they who have feasted in my halls! they shew the arms of my fathers in a foreign land: the sons of the strangers wonder, and bless the friends of Morven's race; for our names have been heard afar; the kings of the world shook in the midst of their host.” Ullin went with his song. Fingal rested on his spear: he saw the mighty foe in his armour: he blest the stranger's son. “How stately art thou, son of the sea!” said the king of woody Morven; “Thy sword is a beam of fire by thy side: thy spear is a pine that defies the storm. The varied face of the moon is not broader than thy shield. Ruddy is thy face of youth! soft the ringlets of thy hair! But this tree may fall; and his memory be forgot! The daughter of the stranger will be sad, looking to the rolling sea: the children will say, “We see a ship; perhaps it is the king of Balclutha.” The tear starts from their mother's eye. Her thoughts are of him who sleeps in Morven!” Such were the words of the king, when Ullin came to the mighty Carthon: he threw down the spear before him; he raised the song of peace. “Come to the feast of Fingal, Carthon, from the rolling sea! partake of the feast of the king, or lift the spear of war! The ghosts of our foes are many: but renowned are the friends of Morven! Behold that field, O Carthon; many a green hill rises there, with mossy stones and rustling grass: these are the tombs of Fingal's foes, the sons of the rolling sea!” “Dost thou speak to the weak in arms!” said Carthon, “bard of the woody Morven? Is my face pale for fear, son of the peaceful song? Why, then, dost thou think to darken my soul with the tales of those who fell? My arm has fought in battle; my renown is known afar. Go to the feeble in arms, bid them yield to Fingal. Have not I seen the fallen Balclutha? And shall I feast with Comhal's son? Comhal! who threw his fire in the midst of my father's hall! I was young, and knew not the cause, why the virgins wept. The columns of smoke pleased mine eye, when they rose above my walls! I often looked back, with gladness, when my friends fled along the hill. But when the years of my youth came on, I beheld the moss of my fallen walls: my sigh arose with the morning, and my tears descended with night. Shall I not fight, I said to my soul, against the children of my foes? And I will fight, O bard! I feel the strength of my soul.” His people gathered around the hero, and drew, at once, their shining swords. He stands, in the midst, like a pillar of fire; the tear half-starting from his eye; for he thought of the fallen Balclutha; the crowded pride of his soul arose. Sidelong he looked up to the hill, where our heroes shone in arms; the spear trembled in his hand: bending forward, he seemed to threaten the king. “Shall I,” said Fingal to his soul, “meet, at once, the youth? Shall I stop him, in the midst of his course, before his fame shall arise? But the bard, hereafter, may say, when he sees the tomb of Carthon; Fingal took his thousands to battle, before the noble Carthon fell. No: bard of the times to come! thou shalt not lessen Fingal's fame. My heroes will fight the youth, and Fingal behold the war. If he overcomes, I rush, in my strength, like the roaring stream of Cona. Who, of my chiefs, will meet the son of the rolling sea? Many are his warriors on the coast: and strong is his ashen spear!” Cathul rose, in his strength, the son of the mighty Lormar: three hundred youths attend the chief, the race of his native streams. Feeble was his arm against Carthon; he fell, and his heroes fled. Connal resumed the battle, but he broke his heavy spear: he lay bound on the field: Carthon pursued his people. “Clessammor!” said the king of Morven, “where is the spear of thy strength? Wilt thou behold Connal bound; thy friend, at the stream of Lora? Rise, in the light of thy steel, companion of valiant Comhal. Let the youth of Balclutha feel the strength of Morven's race.” He rose in the strength of his steel, shaking his grizly locks. He fitted the shield to his side; he rushed, in the pride of valour. Carthon stood on a rock; he saw the hero rushing on. He loved the dreadful joy of his face: his strength, in the locks of age! “Shall I lift that spear,” he said, “that never strikes, but once, a foe? Or shall I, with the words of peace, preserve the warrior's life? Stately are his steps of age! lovely the remnant of his years! Perhaps it is the husband of Moina; the father of car-borne Carthon. Often have I heard, that he dwelt at the echoing stream of Lora.” Such were his words, when Clessammor came, and lifted high his spear. The youth received it on his shield, and spoke the words of peace. “Warrior of the aged locks! Is there no youth to lift the spear? Hast thou no son, to raise the shield before his father, to meet the arm of youth? Is the spouse of thy love no more? or weeps she over the tombs of thy sons? Art thou of the kings of men? What will be the fame of my sword shouldst thou fall?” “It will be great, thou son of pride!” begun the tall Clessammor. “I have been renowned in battle; but I never told my name to a foe. Yield to me, son of the wave, then shalt thou know, that the mark of my sword is in many a field.” “I never yielded, king of spears!” replied the noble pride of Carthon: “I have also fought in war; I behold my future fame. Despise me not, thou chief of men; my arm, my spear, is strong. Retire among thy friends, let younger heroes fight.” “Why dost thou wound my soul,” replied Clessammor with a tear? “Age does not tremble on my hand; I still can lift the sword. Shall I fly in Fingal's sight; in the sight of him I love? Son of the sea! I never fled: exalt thy pointed spear.” They fought, like two contending winds, that strive to roll the wave. Carthon bade his spear to err; he still thought that the foe was the spouse of Moina. He broke Clessammor's beamy spear in twain; he seized his shining sword. But as Carthon was binding the chief; the chief drew the dagger of his fathers. He saw the foe's uncovered side; and opened, there, a wound. Fingal saw Clessammor low: he moved in the sound of his steel. The host stood silent, in his presence; they turned their eyes to the king. He came, like the sullen noise of a storm, before the winds arise: the hunter hears it in the vale, and retires to the cave of the rock. Carthon stood in his place: the blood is rushing down his side: he saw the coming down of the king; his hopes of fame arose; but pale was his cheek: his hair flew loose, his helmet shook on high: the force of Carthon failed; but his soul was strong. Fingal beheld the hero's blood; he stopt the uplifted spear. “Yield, king of swords!” said Comhal's son; “I behold thy blood. Thou hast been mighty in battle; and thy fame shall never fade.” “Art thou the king so far renowned,” replied the car-borne Carthon? “Art thou that light of death, that frightens the kings of the world? But why should Carthon ask? for he is like the stream of his hills; strong as a river, in his course: swift as the eagle of heaven. O that I had fought with the king; that my fame might be great in song! that the hunter, beholding my tomb, might say, he fought with the mighty Fingal. But Carthon dies unknown; he has poured out his force on the weak.” “But thou shalt not die unknown,” replied the king of woody Morven: “my bards are many, O Carthon, their songs descend to future times. The children of years to come shall hear the fame of Carthon; when they sit round the burning oak, and the night is spent in songs of old. The hunter, sitting in the heath, shall hear the rustling blast; and, raising his eyes, behold the rock where Carthon fell. He shall turn to his son, and show the place where the mighty fought; “There the king of Balclutha fought, like the strength of a thousand streams.” Joy rose in Carthon's face: he lifted his heavy eyes. He gave his sword to Fingal, to lie within his hall, that the memory of Balclutha's king might remain in Morven. The battle ceased along the field, the bard had sung the song of peace. The chiefs gathered round the falling Carthon; they heard his words, with sighs. Silent they leaned on their spears, while Balclutha's hero spoke. His hair sighed in the wind, and his voice was sad and low. “King of Morven,” Carthon said, “I fall in the midst of my course. A foreign tomb receives, in youth, the last of Reuthamir's race. Darkness dwells in Balclutha: the shadows of grief in Crathmo. But raise my remembrance on the banks of Lora: where my fathers dwelt. Perhaps the husband of Moina will mourn over his fallen Carthon.” His words reached the heart of Clessammor: he fell, in silence, on his son. The host stood darkened around: no voice is on the plain. Night came, the moon, from the east, looked on the mournful field; but still they stood, like a silent grove that lifts its head on Gormal, when the loud winds are laid, and dark autumn is on the plain. Three days they mourned above Carthon; on the fourth his father died. In the narrow plain of the rock they lie; a dim ghost defends their tomb. There lovely Moina is often seen; when the sun-beam darts on the rock, and all around is dark. There she is seen, Malvina, but not like the daughters of the hill. Her robes are from the stranger's land; and she is still alone! Fingal was sad for Carthon; he commanded his bards to mark the day, when shadowy autumn returned: And often did they mark the day and sing the hero's praise. “Who comes so dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's shadowy cloud? Death is trembling in his hand! his eyes are flames of fire! Who roars along dark Lora's heath? Who but Carthon, king of swords? The people fall! see! how he strides, like the sullen ghost of Morven! But there he lies a goodly oak, which sudden blasts overturned! When shalt thou rise, Balclutha's joy! When, Carthon, shalt thou arise? Who comes so dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's shadowy cloud?” Such were the words of the bards, in the day of their mourning: Ossian often joined their voice; and added to their song. “My soul has been mournful for Carthon; he fell in the days of his youth: and thou, O Clessammor! where is thy dwelling in the wind? Has the youth forgot his wound? Flies he, on clouds, with thee? I feel the sun, O Malvina, leave me to my rest. Perhaps they may come to my dreams; I think I hear a feeble voice! The beam of heaven delights to shine on the grave of Carthon: I feel it warm around! “O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers! Whence are thy beams, O sun! thy everlasting light? Thou comest forth, in thy awful beauty; the stars hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and pale, sinks in the western wave. But thou thyself movest alone; who can be a companion of thy course! The oaks of the mountains fall; the mountains themselves decay with years; the ocean shrinks and grows again; the moon herself is lost in heaven: but thou art for ever the same; rejoicing in the brightness of thy course. When the world is dark with tempests; when thunder rolls, and lightning flies; thou lookest in thy beauty, from the clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to Ossian, thou lookest in vain; for he beholds thy beams no more; whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds, or thou tremblest at the gates of the west. But thou art perhaps, like me, for a season, thy years will have an end. Thou shalt sleep in the clouds, careless of the voice of the morning. Exult then, O sun, in the strength of thy youth! Age is dark and unlovely; it is like the glimmering light of the moon, when it shines through broken clouds, and the mist is on the hills; the blast of north is on the plain, the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey. THE DEATH OF CUTHULLIN: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Cuthullin, after the arms of Fingal had expelled Swaran from Ireland, continued to manage the affairs of that kingdom as the guardian of Cormac, the young king. In the third year of Cuthullin's administration, Torlath, the son of Cantela, rebelled in Connaught; and advanced to Temora to dethrone Cormac. Cuthullin marched against him, came up with him at the lake of Lego, and totally defeated his forces. Torlath fell in battle by Cuthullin's hand; but as he too eagerly pressed on the enemy, he was mortally wounded. The affairs of Cormach, though, for some time, supported by Nathos, fell into confusion at the death of Cuthullin. Cormac himself was slain by the rebel Cairbar; and the re-establishment of the royal family of Ireland by Fingal, furnishes the subject of the epic poem of Temora. Macpherson. Is the wind on the shield of Fingal? Is the wind on the shield of Fingal? Or is the voice of past times in my hall? Sing on, sweet voice; for thou art pleasant. Thou carriest away my night with joy. Sing on, O Bragela, daughter of car-borne Sorglan! “It is the white wave of the rock, and not Cuthullin's sails. Often do the mists deceive me, for the ship of my love! when they rise round some ghost, and spread their grey skirts on the wind. Why dost thou delay thy coming, son of the generous Semo? Four times has autumn returned with its winds, and raised the seas of Togorma, since thou hast been in the roar of battles, and Bragela distant far! Hills of the isle of mist! when will ye answer to his hounds? But ye are dark in your clouds. Sad Bragela calls in vain! Night comes rolling down. The face of ocean fails. The heath-cock's head is beneath his wing. The hind sleeps with the hart of the desert. They shall rise with morning's light, and feed by the mossy stream. But my tears return with the sun. My sighs come on with the night. When wilt thou come in thine arms, O chief of Erin's wars?” Pleasant is thy voice in Ossian's ear, daughter of car-borne Sorglan! But retire to the hall of shells; to the beam of the burning oak. Attend to the murmur of the sea; it rolls at Dunscai's walls. Let sleep descend on thy blue eyes. Let the hero arise in thy dreams!. Cuthullin sits at Lego's lake, at the dark rolling of waters. Night is around the hero. His thousands spread on the heath. A hundred oaks burn in the midst. The feast of shells is smoking wide. Carril strikes the harp beneath a tree. His grey locks glitter in the beam. The rustling blast of night is near, and lifts his aged hair. His song is of the blue Togorma, and of its chief, Cuthullin's friend! “Why art thou absent, Connal, in the days of the gloomy storm? The chiefs of the south have convened, against the car-borne Cormac. The winds detain thy sails. Thy blue waters roll around thee. But Cormac is not alone. The son of Semo fights his wars! Semo's son his battles fights! the terror of the stranger! He that is like the vapour of death, slowly borne by sultry winds. The sun reddens in his presence: The people fall around.” Such was the song of Carril, when a son of the foe appeared. He threw down his pointless spear. He spoke the words of Torlath! Torlath, chief of heroes, from Lego's sable surge! He that led his thousands to battle against car-borne Cormac. Cormac, who was distant far, in Temora's echoing halls: he learned to bend the bow of his fathers; and to lift the spear. Nor long didst thou lift the spear, mildly-shining beam of youth! death stands dim behind thee, like the darkened half of the moon, behind its growing light! Cuthullin rose before the bard, that came from generous Torlath. He offered him the shell of joy. He honoured the son of songs. “Sweet voice of Lego!” he said, “what are the words of Torlath? Comes he to our feast or battle, the car-borne son of Cantela?” “He comes to thy battle,” replied the bard, “to the sounding strife of spears. When morning is grey on Lego, Torlath will fight on the plain. Wilt thou meet him, in thine arms, king of the isle of mist? Terrible is the spear of Torlath! it is a meteor of night. He lifts it, and the people fall! death sits in the lightning of his sword!” “Do I fear,” replied Cuthullin, “the spear of car-borne Torlath? He is brave as a thousand heroes; but my soul delights in war! The sword rests not by the side of Cuthullin, bard of the times of old! Morning shall meet me on the plain, and gleam on the blue arms of Semo's son. But sit thou on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice. Partake of the joyful shell; and hear the songs of Temora!” “This is no time,” replied the bard, “to hear the song of joy; when the mighty are to meet in battle, like the strength of the waves of Lego. Why art thou so dark, Slimora! with all thy silent woods! No star trembles on thy top. No moon-beam on thy side. But the meteors of death are there: the grey watry forms of ghosts. Why art thou dark, Slimora! with thy silent woods?” He retired, in the sound of his song. Carril joined his voice. The music was like the memory of joys that are past, pleasant and mournful to the soul. The ghosts of departed bards heard on Slimora's side. Soft sounds spread along the wood. The silent valleys of night rejoice. So, when he sits in the silence of the day, in the valley of his breeze, the humming of the mountain bee comes to Ossian's ear: the gale drowns it in its course; but the pleasant sound returns again! Slant looks the sun on the field; gradual grows the shade of the hill! “Raise,” said Cuthullin to his hundred bards, “the song of the noble Fingal: that song which he hears at night, when the dreams of his rest descend; when the bards strike the distant harp, and the faint light gleams on Selma's walls. Or let the grief of Lara rise; the sighs of the mother of Calmar, when he was sought, in vain, on his hills; when she beheld his bow in the hall. Carril, place the shield of Caithbat on that branch. Let the spear of Cuthullin be near; that the sound of my battle may rise, with the grey beam of the east.” The hero leaned on his father's shield: the song of Lara rose! The hundred bards were distant far: Carril alone is near the chief. The words of the song were his: the sound of his harp was mournful. “Alcletha with the aged locks! mother of car-borne Calmar! why dost thou look toward the desert, to behold the return of thy son! These are not his heroes, dark on the heath: nor is that the voice of Calmar. It is but the distant grove, Alcletha! but the roar of the mountain wind!” “Who bounds over Lara's stream, sister of the noble Calmar? Does not Alcletha behold his spear? But her eyes are dim! Is it not the son of Matha, daughter of my love?” “It is but an aged oak, Alcletha!” replied the lovely weeping Alona. “It is but an oak, Alcletha, bent over Lara's stream. But who comes along the plain? sorrow is in his speed. He lifts high the spear of Calmar. Alcletha, it is covered with blood!” “But it is covered with the blood of foes, sister of car-borne Calmar! His spear never returned unstained with blood: nor his bow from the strife of the mighty. The battle is consumed in his presence: he is a flame of death, Alona! Youth of the mournful speed! where is the son of Alcletha? Does he return with his fame, in the midst of his echoing shields? Thou art dark and silent! Calmar is then no more. Tell me not, warrior, how he fell. I must not hear of his wound!” Why dost thou look towards the desert, mother of low-laid Calmar? Such was the song of Carril, when Cuthullin lay on his shield. The bards rested on their harps. Sleep fell softly around. The son of Semo was awake alone. His soul was fixed on war. The burning oaks began to decay. Faint red light is spread around. A feeble voice is heard! The ghost of Calmar came! He stalked dimly along the beam. Dark is the wound in his side. His hair is disordered and loose. Joy sits pale on his face. He seems to invite Cuthullin to his cave. “Son of the cloudy night!” said the rising chief of Erin, “Why dost thou bend thy dark eyes on me, ghost of the noble Calmar? Wouldest thou frighten me, O Matha's son! from the battles of Cormac? Thy hand was not feeble in war; neither was thy voice for peace. How art thou changed, chief of Lara! if thou now dost advise to fly! But, Calmar, I never fled. I never feared the ghosts of night. Small is their knowledge, weak their hands; their dwelling is in the wind. But my soul grows in danger, and rejoices in the noise of steel. Retire thou to thy cave. Thou art not Calmar's ghost. He delighted in battle. His arm was like the thunder of heaven!” He retired in his blast with joy; for he had heard the voice of his praise. The faint beam of the morning rose. The sound of Caithbat's buckler spread. Green Erin's warriors convened, like the roar of many streams. The horn of war is heard over Lego. The mighty Torlath came. “Why dost thou come with thy thousands, Cuthullin,” said the chief of Lego. “I know the strength of thy arm. Thy soul is an unextinguished fire. Why fight we not on the plain, and let our hosts behold our deeds? Let them behold us like roaring waves, that tumble round a rock: the mariners hasten away, and look on their strife with fear. “Thou risest, like the sun, on my soul,” replied the son of Semo. “Thine arm is mighty, O Torlath! and worthy of my wrath. Retire, ye men of Ullin, to Slimora's shady side. Behold the chief of Erin, in the day of his fame. Carril! tell to mighty Connal, if Cuthullin must fall; tell him I accused the winds, which roar on Togorma's waves. Never was he absent in battle, when the strife of my fame arose. Let his sword be before Cormac, like the beam of heaven. Let his counsel sound in Temora, in the day of danger!” He rushed, in the sound of his arms, like the terrible spirit of Lora; when he comes, in the roar of a thousand storms, and scatters battles from his eyes. He sits on a cloud over Lochlin's seas. His mighty hand is on his sword. Winds lift his flaming locks! The waining moon half-lights his dreadful face. His features, blended in darkness, arise to view. So terrible was Cuthullin in the day of his fame. Torlath fell by his hand. Lego's heroes mourned. They gather around the chief, like the clouds of the desert. A thousand swords rose at once; a thousand arrows flew; but he stood like a rock in the midst of a roaring sea. They fell around. He strode in blood. Dark Slimora echoed wide. The sons of Ullin came. The battle spread over Lego. The chief of Erin overcame. He returned over the field with his fame. But pale he returned! The joy of his face was dark. He rolled his eyes in silence. The sword hung, unsheathed, in his hand. His spear bent at every step! “Carril,” said the chief in secret, “the strength of Cuthullin fails. My days are with the years that are past. No morning of mine shall arise. They shall seek me at Temora; but I shall not be found. Cormac will weep in his hall, and say, “Where is Erin's chief?” But my name is renowned! my fame in the song of bards. The youth will say in secret, “O let me die as Cuthullin died. Renown clothed him like a robe. The light of his fame is great.” Draw the arrow from my side. Lay Cuthullin beneath that oak. Place the shield of Caithbat near, that they may behold me amidst the arms of my fathers!” “And is the son of Semo fallen?” said Carril, with a sigh. “Mournful are Tura's walls. Sorrow dwells at Dunscäi. Thy spouse is left alone in her youth. The son of thy love is alone! He shall come to Bragela, and ask her why she weeps. He shall lift his eyes to the wall, and see his father's sword. “Whose sword is that?” he will say. The soul of his mother is sad. Who is that, like the hart of the desert, in the murmur of his course? His eyes look wildly round in search of his friend. Connal, son of Colgar, where hast thou been, when the mighty fell? Did the seas of Cogorma roll around thee? Was the wind of the south in thy sails? The mighty have fallen in battle, and thou wast not there. Let none tell it in Selma, nor in Morven's woody land. Fingal will be sad, and the sons of the desert mourn!” By the dark rolling waves of Lego they raised the hero's tomb. Luäth, at a distance, lies. The song of bards rose over the dead. “Blest be thy soul, son of Semo. Thou wert mighty in battle. Thy strength was like the strength of a stream: thy speed like the eagle's wing. Thy path in battle was terrible: the steps of death were behind thy sword. Blest be thy soul, son of Semo, car-borne chief of Dunscäi. Thou hast not fallen by the sword of the mighty, neither was thy blood on the spear of the brave. The arrow came, like the sting of death in a blast: nor did the feeble hand, which drew the bow, perceive it. Peace to thy soul, in thy cave, chief of the isle of mist!” “The mighty are dispersed at Temora: there is none in Cormac's hall. The king mourns in his youth. He does not behold thy return. The sound of thy shield is ceased: his foes are gathering round. Soft be thy rest in thy cave, chief of Erin's wars! Bragela will not hope for thy return, or see thy sails in ocean's foam. Her steps are not on the shore; nor her ear open to the voice of thy rowers. She sits in the hall of shells. She sees the arms of him that is no more. Thine eyes are full of tears, daughter of car-borne Sorglan! Blest be thy soul in death, O chief of shady Tura!” DAR-THULA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. It may not be improper here to give the story which is the foundation of this poem, as it is handed down by tradition. Usnoth, lord of Etha, which is probably that part of Argyleshire which is near Loch Eta, an arm of the sea in Lorn, had three sons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan, by Slissama, the daughter of Semo, and sister to the celebrated Cuthullin. The three brothers, when very young, were sent over to Ireland, by their father, to learn the use of arms, under their uncle, Cuthullin, who made a great figure in that kingdom. They were just landed in Ulster when the news of Cuthullin's death arrived. Nathos, though very young, took the command of Cuthullin's army, made head against Cairbar the usurper, and defeated him in several battles. Cairbar at last having found means to murder Cormac the lawful king, the army of Nathos shifted sides, and he himself was obliged to return into Ulster, in order to pass over into Scotland. Dar-thula, the daughter of Colla, with whom Cairbar was in love, resided, at that time, in Selama, a castle in Ulster: she saw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but a storm rising at sea, they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coast of Ulster, where Cairbar was encamped with his army. The three brothers, after having defended themselves, for some time, with great bravery, were overpowered and slain, and the unfortunate Dar-thula killed herself upon the body of her beloved Nathos. The poem opens, on the night preceding the death of the sons of Usnoth, and brings in, by way of episode, what passed before. It relates the death of Dar-thula differently from the common tradition; this account is the most probable, as suicide seems to have been unknown in those early times: for no traces of it are found in the old poetry. Macpherson. Daughter of heaven, fair art thou! Daughter of heaven, fair art thou! the silence of thy face is pleasant! Thou comest forth in loveliness. The stars attend thy blue course in the east. The clouds rejoice in thy presence, O moon: They brighten with dark-brown sides. Who is like thee in heaven, light of the silent night? The stars are ashamed in thy presence. They turn away their sparkling eyes. Whither dost thou retire from thy course, when the darkness of thy countenance grows? Hast thou thy hall, like Ossian? Dwellest thou in the shadow of grief? Have thy sisters fallen from heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee, at night, no more? Yes, they have fallen, fair light! and thou dost often retire to mourn. But thou thyself shalt fail, one night; and leave thy blue path in heaven. The stars will then lift their heads: they, who were ashamed in thy presence, will rejoice. Thou art now clothed with thy brightness. Look from thy gates in the sky. Burst the cloud, O wind, that the daughter of night may look forth! that the shaggy mountains may brighten, and the ocean roll its white waves, in light. Nathos is on the deep, and Althos, that beam of youth. Ardan is near his brothers. They move in the gloom of their course. The sons of Usnoth move in darkness, from the wrath of Cairbar of Erin. Who is that dim, by their side? the night has covered her beauty! Her hair sighs on ocean's wind. Her robe streams in dusky wreaths. She is, like the fair spirit of heaven, in the midst of his shadowy mist. Who is it but Dar-thula, the first of Erin's maids? She has fled from the love of Cairbar with blue-shielded Nathos. But the winds deceive thee, O Dar-thula. They deny the woody Etha, to thy sails. These are not the mountains of Nathos; nor is that the roar of his climbing waves. The halls of Cairbar are near: the towers of the foe lift their heads! Erin stretches its green head into the sea. Tura's bay receives the ship. Where have ye been, ye southern winds! when the sons of my love were deceived? But ye have been sporting on plains, pursuing the thistle's beard. O that ye had been rustling, in the sails of Nathos, till the hills of Etha arose! till they arose in their clouds, and saw their returning chief! Long hast thou been absent, Nathos! The day of thy return is past! But the land of strangers saw thee, lovely: thou wast lovely in the eyes of Dar-thula. Thy face was like the light of the morning. Thy hair like the raven's wing. Thy soul was generous and mild, like the hour of the setting sun. Thy words were the gale of the reeds; the gliding stream of Lora! But when the rage of battle rose, thou wast a sea in a storm. The clang of thy arms was terrible: the host vanished at the sound of thy course. It was then Dar-thula beheld thee, from the top of her mossy tower: from the tower of Selama, where her fathers dwelt. “Lovely art thou, O stranger!” she said, for her trembling soul arose. “Fair art thou in thy battles, friend of the fallen Cormac! Why dost thou rush on, in thy valour, youth of the ruddy look? Few are thy hands, in fight, against the dark-browed Cairbar! O that I might be freed from his love! that I might rejoice in the presence of Nathos! Blest are the rocks of Etha! they will behold his steps at the chace! they will see his white bosom, when the winds lift his flowing hair!” Such were thy words, Dar-thula, in Selama's mossy towers. But, now, the night is around thee. The winds have deceived thy sails. The winds have deceived thy sails, Dar-thula! Their blustering sound is high. Cease a little while, O north wind. Let me hear the voice of the lovely. Thy voice is lovely, O Dar-thula, between the rustling blasts. “Are these the rocks of Nathos?” she said, “This the roar of his mountain-streams? Comes that beam of light from Usnoth's nightly hall? The mist spreads around; the beam is feeble and distant far. But the light of Dar-thula's soul dwells in the chief of Etha! Son of the generous Usnoth, why that broken sigh? Are we in the land of strangers, chief of echoing Etha!” “These are not the rocks of Nathos,” he replied, “not this the roar of his streams. No light comes from Etha's halls, for they are distant far. We are in the land of strangers, in the land of cruel Cairbar. The winds have deceived us, Dar-thula. Erin lifts here her hills. Go towards the north, Althos; be thy steps, Ardan, along the coast; that the foe may not come in darkness, and our hopes of Etha fail.” “I will go towards that mossy tower, to see who dwells about the beam. Rest, Dar-thula, on the shore! rest in peace, thou lovely light! the sword of Nathos is around thee, like the lightning of heaven!” He went. She sat alone; she heard the rolling of the wave. The big tear is in her eye. She looks for returning Nathos. Her soul trembles at the blast. She turns her ear towards the tread of his feet. The tread of his feet is not heard. “Where art thou, son of my love! The roar of the blast is around me. Dark is the cloudy night. But Nathos does not return. What detains thee, chief of Etha? Have the foes met the hero in the strife of the night?” He returned, but his face was dark. He had seen his departed friend! It was the wall of Tura. The ghost of Cuthullin stalked there alone: the sighing of his breast was frequent. The decayed flame of his eyes was terrible! His spear was a column of mist. The stars looked dim through his form. His voice was like hollow wind in a cave: his eye a light seen afar. He told the tale of grief. The soul of Nathos was sad, like the sun in the day of mist, when his face is watry and dim. “Why art thou sad, O Nathos?” said the lovely daughter of Colla. “Thou art a pillar of light to Dar-thula. The joy of her eyes is in Etha's chief. Where is my friend, but Nathos? My father, my brother is fallen! Silence dwells on Selama. Sadness spreads on the blue streams of my land. My friends have fallen with Cormac. The mighty were slain in the battles of Erin. Hear, son of Usnoth! hear, O Nathos, my tale of grief. “Evening darkened on the plain. The blue streams failed before mine eyes. The unfrequent blast came rustling, in the tops of Selama's groves. My seat was beneath a tree, on the walls of my fathers. Truthal past before my soul: the brother of my love: he that was absent in battle, against the haughty Cairbar! Bending on his spear, the grey-haired Colla came. His downcast face is dark, and sorrow dwells in his soul. His sword is on the side of the hero: the helmet of his fathers on his head. The battle grows in his breast. He strives to hide the tear. “Dar-thula, my daughter,” he said, “thou art the last of Colla's race! Truthil is fallen in battle. The chief of Selama is no more! Cairbar comes, with his thousands, towards Selama's walls. Colla will meet his pride, and revenge his son. But where shall I find thy safety, Dar-thula, with the dark-brown hair! thou art lovely as the sun-beam of heaven, and thy friends are low!” “Is the son of battle fallen?” I said, with a sigh. “Ceased the generous soul of Truthil to lighten through the field? My safety, Colla, is in that bow. I have learned to pierce the deer. Is not Cairbar like the hart of the desert, father of fallen Truthil?” “The face of age brightened with joy. The crowded tears of his eyes poured down. The lips of Colla trembled. His grey beard whistled in the blast. “Thou art the sister of Truthil,” he said; “thou burnest in the fire of his soul. Take, Dar-thula, take that spear, that brazen shield, that burnished helm: they are the spoils of a warrior, a son of early youth! When the light rises on Selama, we go to meet the car-borne Cairbar. But keep thou near the arm of Colla, beneath the shadow of my shield. Thy father, Dar-thula, could once defend thee; but age is trembling on his hand. The strength of his arm has failed. His soul is darkened with grief.” We passed the night in sorrow. The light of morning rose. I shone in the arms of battle. The grey-haired hero moved before. The sons of Selama convened, around the sounding shield of Colla. But few were they in the plain, and their locks were grey. The youths had fallen with Truthil, in the battle of car-borne Cormac. “Friends of my youth!” said Colla, “it was not thus you have seen me in arms. It was not thus I strode to battle, when the great Confadan fell. But ye are laden with grief. The darkness of age comes like the mist of the desert. My shield is worn with years! my sword is fixed in its place! I said to my soul, thy evening shall be calm: Thy departure like a fading light. But the storm has returned. I bend like an aged oak. My boughs are fallen on Selama. I tremble in my place. Where art thou, with thy fallen heroes, O my beloved Truthil! Thou answerest not from thy rushing blast. The soul of thy father is sad. But I will be sad no more, Cairbar or Colla must fall! I feel the returning strength of my arm. My heart leaps at the sound of war.” The hero drew his sword. The gleaming blades of his people rose. They moved along the plain. Their grey hair streamed in the wind. Cairbar sat at the feast, in the silent plain of Lona. He saw the coming of the heroes. He called his chiefs to war. Why should I tell to Nathos how the strife of battle grew? I have seen thee, in the midst of thousands, like the beam of heaven's fire: it is beautiful, but terrible; the people fall in its dreadful course. The spear of Colla flew. He remembered the battles of his youth. An arrow came with its sound. It pierced the hero's side. He fell on his echoing shield. My soul started with fear. I stretched my buckler over him: but my breast was seen! Cairbar came, with his spear. He beheld Selama's maid. Joy rose on his dark-brown face. He stayed the lifted steel. He raised the tomb of Colla. He brought me weeping to Selama. He spoke the words of love; but my soul was sad. I saw the shields of my fathers; the sword of car-borne Truthil. I saw the arms of the dead; the tear was on my cheek! Then thou didst come, O Nathos: and gloomy Cairbar fled. He fled like the ghost of the desert before the morning's beam. His host was not near: and feeble was his arm against thy steel! Why art thou sad, O Nathos! said the lovely daughter of Colla? “I have met,” replied the hero, “the battle in my youth. My arm could not lift the spear, when danger first arose. My soul brightened in the presence of war, as the green narrow vale, when the sun pours his streamy beams, before he hides his face in a storm. The lonely traveller feels a mournful joy. He sees the darkness that slowly comes. My soul brightened in danger before I saw Selama's fair; before I saw thee, like a star, that shines on the hill, at night: the cloud advances, and threatens the lovely light! We are in the land of foes. The winds have deceived us, Dar-thula! The strength of our friends is not near, nor the mountains of Etha. Where shall I find thy peace, daughter of mighty Colla! The brothers of Nathos are brave! and his own sword has shone in fight. But what are the sons of Usnoth to the host of dark-browed Cairbar! O that the winds had brought thy sails, Oscar, king of men! Thou didst promise to come to the battles of fallen Cormac! Then would my hand be strong, as the flaming arm of death. Cairbar would tremble in his halls, and peace dwell round the lovely Dar-thula. But why dost thou fall, my soul? The sons of Usnoth may prevail!” “And they will prevail, O Nathos!” said the rising soul of the maid. “Never shall Dar-thula behold the halls of gloomy Cairbar. Give me those arms of brass, that glitter to the passing meteor. I see them dimly in the dark-bosomed ship. Darthula will enter the battle of steel. Ghost of the noble Colla! do I behold thee on that cloud? Who is that dim beside thee? Is it the car-borne Truthil? Shall I behold the halls of him that slew Selama's chief? No: I will not behold them, spirits of my love!” Joy rose in the face of Nathos, when he heard the white-bosomed maid. “Daughter of Selama! thou shinest along my soul. Come, with thy thousands, Cairbar; the strength of Nathos is returned! Thou, O aged Usnoth, shalt not hear that thy son has fled. I remember thy words on Etha; when my sails began to rise; when I spread them towards Erin, towards the mossy walls of Tura! “Thou goest,” he said, “O Nathos, to the king of shields! Thou goest to Cuthullin, chief of men, who never fled from danger. Let not thine arm be feeble: neither be thy thoughts of flight; lest the son of Semo should say, that Erin's race are weak. His words may come to Usnoth, and sadden his soul in the hall. The tear was on my father's cheek.” He gave this shining sword! “I came to Tura's bay: but the halls of Tura were silent. I looked around, and there was none to tell of the son of generous Semo. I went to the hall of shells, where the arms of his fathers hung. But the arms were gone, and aged Lamhor sat in tears. Whence are the arms of steel, said the rising Lamhor? The light of the spear has long been absent from Tura's dusky walls. Come ye from the rolling sea? Or from Temora's mournful halls? “We come from the sea,” I said, “from Usnoth's rising tower. We are the sons of Slissáma, the daughter of car-borne Semo. Where is Tura's chief, son of the silent hall? But why should Nathos ask? for I behold thy tears. How did the mighty fall, son of the lonely Tura?” “He fell not,” Lamhor replied, “like the silent star of night, when it flies through darkness, and is no more. But he was like a meteor that shoots into a distant land. Death attends its dreary course. Itself is the sign of wars. Mournful are the banks of Lego; and the roar of streamy Lara! There the hero fell, son of the noble Usnoth.” “The hero fell in the midst of slaughter,” I said, with a bursting sigh. “His hand was strong in war. Death dimly sat behind his sword.” We came to Lego's sounding banks. We found his rising tomb. His friends in battle are there: his bards of many songs. Three days we mourned over the hero; on the fourth I struck the shield of Caithbat. The heroes gathered around with joy, and shook their beamy spears. Corlath was near with his host, the friend of car-borne Cairbar. We came like a stream by night. His heroes fell before us. When the people of the valley rose, they saw their blood with morning's light. But we rolled away, like wreaths of mist, to Cormac's echoing hall. Our swords rose to defend the king. But Temora's halls were empty. Cormac had fallen in his youth. The king of Erin was no more! Sadness seized the sons of Erin. They slowly, gloomily retired; like clouds that, long having threatened rain, vanish behind the hills. The sons of Usnoth moved, in their grief, towards Tura's sounding bay. We passed by Selama. Cairbar retired like Lano's mist, when driven before the winds. It was then I beheld thee, O Dar-thula, like the light of Etha's sun. “Lovely is that beam!” I said. The crowded sigh of my bosom rose. “Thou camest in thy beauty, Dar-thula, to Erin's mournful chief. But the winds have deceived us, daughter of Colla, and the foe is near!” “Yes! the foe is near,” said the rushing strength of Althos; “I hear their clanging arms on the coast. I saw the dark wreaths of Erin's standard. Distinct is the voice of Cairbar. Loud as Cromla's falling stream. He had seen the dark ship on the sea, before the dusky night came down. His people watch on Lena's plain. They lift ten thousand swords.” “And let them lift ten thousand swords,” said Nathos, with a smile. “The sons of car-borne Usnoth will never tremble in danger! Why dost thou roll with all thy foam, thou roaring sea of Erin? Why do ye rustle on your dark wings, ye whistling storms of the sky? Do ye think, ye storms, that ye keep Nathos on the coast? No: his soul detains him, children of the night! Althos! bring my father's arms: thou seest them beaming to the stars. Bring the spear of Semo. It stands in the dark-bosomed ship!” He brought the arms. Nathos covered his limbs, in all their shining steel. The stride of the chief is lovely. The joy of his eyes was terrible. He looks towards the coming of Cairbar. The wind is rustling in his hair. Dar-thula is silent at his side. Her look is fixed on the chief. She strives to hide the rising sigh. Two tears swell in her radiant eyes! “Althos!” said the chief of Erin, “I see a cave in that rock. Place Dar-thula there. Let thy arm, my brother, be strong. Ardan! we meet the foe; call to battle gloomy Cairbar. O that he came in his sounding steel, to meet the son of Usnoth! Dar-thula! if thou shalt escape, look not on the fallen Nathos! Lift thy sails, O Althos, towards the echoing groves of my land.” “Tell the chief, that his son fell with fame; that my sword did not shun the fight. Tell him I fell in the midst of thousands. Let the joy of his grief be great. Daughter of Colla! call the maids to Etha's echoing hall! Let their songs arise for Nathos, when shadowy autumn returns. O that the voice of Cona, that Ossian, might be heard in my praise! then would my spirit rejoice in the midst of the rushing winds.” “And my voice shall praise thee, Nathos, chief of the woody Etha! The voice of Ossian shall rise in thy praise, son of the generous Usnoth! Why was I not on Lena, when the battle rose? Then would the sword of Ossian defend thee; or himself fall low!” We sat that night in Selma, round the strength of the shell. The wind was abroad, in the oaks. The spirit of the mountain roared. The blast came rustling through the hall, and gently touched my harp. The sound was mournful and low, like the song of the tomb. Fingal heard it the first. The crowded sighs of his bosom rose. “Some of my heroes are low,” said the grey-haired king of Morven. “I hear the sound of death on the harp. Ossian, touch the trembling string. Bid the sorrow rise; that their spirits may fly with joy, to Morven's woody hills!” I touched the harp before the king; the sound was mournful and low. “Bend forward from your clouds,” I said, “ghosts of my fathers! bend. Lay by the red terror of your course. Receive the falling chief; whether he comes from a distant land, or rises from the rolling sea. Let his robe of mist be near; his spear that is formed of a cloud. Place an half-extinguished meteor by his side, in the form of the hero's sword. And, oh! let his countenance be lovely, that his friends may delight in his presence. Bend from your clouds,” I said, “ghosts of my fathers! bend!” Such was my song, in Selma, to the lightly-trembling harp. But Nathos was on Erin's shore, surrounded by the night. He heard the voice of the foe, amidst the roar of tumbling waves. Silent he heard their voice, and rested on his spear! Morning rose, with its beams. The sons of Erin appear, like grey rocks, with all their trees; they spread along the coast. Cairbar stood in the midst. He grimly smiled when he saw the foe. Nathos rushed forward in his strength: nor could Dar-thula stay behind. She came with the hero, lifting her shining spear. “And who are these, in their armour, in the pride of youth? Who but the sons of Usnoth, Althos and dark-haired Ardan?” “Come,” said Nathos, “come! chief of high Temora! Let our battle be on the coast, for the white-bosomed maid. His people are not with Nathos; they are behind these rolling seas. Why dost thou bring thy thousands against the chief of Etha? Thou didst fly from him in battle, when his friends were around his spear.” “Youth of the heart of pride, shall Erin's king fight with thee? Thy fathers were not among the renowned, nor of the kings of men. Are the arms of foes in their halls? Or the shields of other times? Cairbar is renowned in Temora: nor does he fight with feeble men!” The tear started from car-borne Nathos. He turned his eyes to his brothers. Their spears flew, at once. Three heroes lay on earth. Then the light of their swords gleamed on high. The ranks of Erin yield; as a ridge of dark clouds before a blast of wind! Then Cairbar ordered his people, and they drew a thousand bows. A thousand arrows flew. The sons of Usnoth fell in blood. They fell like three young oaks, which stood alone on the hill: The traveller saw the lovely trees, and wondered how they grew so lonely: the blast of the desert came, by night, and laid their green heads low: Next day he returned: but they were withered, and the heath was bare! Dar-thula stood in silent grief, and beheld their fall! No tear is in her eye. But her look is wildly sad. Pale was her cheek. Her trembling lips broke short an half-formed word. Her dark hair flew on wind. The gloomy Cairbar came. “Where is thy lover now? the car-borne chief of Etha? Hast thou beheld the halls of Usnoth? Or the dark-brown hills of Fingal? My battle would have roared on Morven, had not the winds met Dar-thula. Fingal himself would have been low, and sorrow dwelling in Selma!” Her shield fell from Dar-thula's arm. Her breast of snow appeared. It appeared; but it was stained with blood. An arrow was fixed in her side. She fell on the fallen Nathos, like a wreath of snow! Her hair spreads wide on his face. Their blood is mixing round! “Daughter of Colla! thou art low!” said Cairbar's hundred bards. “Silence is at the blue streams of Selama. Truthil's race have failed. When wilt thou rise in thy beauty, first of Erin's maids? Thy sleep is long in the tomb. The morning distant far. The sun shall not come to thy bed, and say, “Awake, Dar-thula! awake, thou first of women! the wind of spring is abroad! The flowers shake their heads on the green hills. The woods wave their growing leaves. Retire, O sun, the daughter of Colla is asleep. She will not come forth in her beauty. She will not move, in the steps of her loveliness!” Such was the song of the bards, when they raised the tomb. I sung over the grave, when the king of Morven came; when he came to green Erin to fight with car-borne Cairbar! CARRIC-THURA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Fingal, returning from an expedition which he had made into the Roman province, resolved to visit Cathulla king of Inistore, and brother to Comala, whose story is related, at large, in a preceding dramatic poem. Upon his coming in sight of Carric-thura, the palace of Cathulla, he observed a flame on its top, which, in those days, was a signal of distress. The wind drove him into a bay, at some distance from Carric-thura, and he was obliged to pass the night on the shore. Next day he attacked the army of Frothal king of Sora, who had besieged Cathulla in his palace of Carric-thura, and took Frothal himself prisoner, after he had engaged him in a single combat. The deliverance of Carric-thura is the subject of the poem, but several other episodes are interwoven with it. It appears from tradition, that this poem was addressed to a Culdee, or one of the first Christian missionaries, and that the story of the Spirit of Loda, supposed to be the ancient Odin of Scandinavia, was introduced by Ossian in opposition to the Culdee's doctrine. Be this as it will, it lets us into Ossian's notions of a superior being; and shews that he was not addicted to the superstition which prevailed all the world over, before the introduction of Christianity. Macpherson. Hast thou left thy blue course in heaven Hast thou left thy blue course in heaven, golden-haired son of the sky! The west has opened its gates; the bed of thy repose is there. The waves come to behold thy beauty. They lift their trembling heads. They see thee lovely in thy sleep; they shrink away with fear. Rest, in thy shady cave, O sun! let thy return be in joy. But let a thousand lights arise to the sound of the harps of Selma: let the beam spread in the hall, the king of shells is returned! The strife of Carun is past, like sounds that are no more. Raise the song, O bards; the king is returned with his fame! Such were the words of Ullin, when Fingal returned from war: when he returned in the fair blushing of youth, with all his heavy locks. His blue arms were on the hero; like a light cloud on the sun, when he moves in his robes of mist, and shews but half his beams. His heroes follow the king: the feast of shells is spread. Fingal turns to his bards, and bids the song to rise. “Voices of echoing Cona,” he said, “O bards of other times! Ye, on whose souls the blue hosts of our fathers rise! strike the harp in my hall; and let me hear the song. Pleasant is the joy of grief! it is like the shower of spring, when it softens the branch of the oak, and the young leaf rears its green head. Sing on, O bards, to-morrow we lift the sail. My blue course is through the ocean, to Carric-thura's walls; the mossy walls of Sarno, where Comala dwelt. There the noble Cathulla spreads the feast of shells. The boars of his woods are many; the sound of the chace shall arise!” “Cronnan, son of the song!” said Ullin, Minona, graceful at the harp! raise the tale of Shilric, to please the king of Morven. Let Vinvela come in her beauty, like the showery bow, when it shews its lovely head on the lake, and the setting sun is bright. She comes, O Fingal! her voice is soft, but sad. VINVELA. My love is a son of the hill. He pursues the flying deer. His grey dogs are panting around him; his bow-string sounds in the wind. Dost thou rest by the fount of the rock, or by the noise of the mountain-stream? the rushes are nodding to the wind, the mist flies over the hill. I will approach my love unseen; I will behold him from the rock. Lovely I saw thee first by the aged oak of Branno; thou wert returning tall from the chace; the fairest among thy friends. SHILRIC. What voice is that I hear? that voice like the summer-wind! I sit not by the nodding rushes; I hear not the fount of the rock. Afar, Vinvela, afar, I go to the wars of Fingal. My dogs attend me no more. No more I tread the hill. No more from on high I see thee, fair-moving by the stream of the plain; bright as the bow of heaven; as the moon on the western wave. VINVELA. Then thou art gone, O Shilric! I am alone on the hill! The deer are seen on the brow; void of fear they graze along. No more they dread the wind; no more the rustling tree. The hunter is far removed, he is in the field of graves. Strangers! sons of the waves! spare my lovely Shilric! SHILRIC. If fall I must in the field, raise high my grave, Vinvela. Grey stones and heaped-up earth shall mark me to future times. When the hunter shall sit by the mound, and produce his food at noon, “Some warrior rests here,” he will say; and my fame shall live in his praise. Remember me, Vinvela, when low on earth I lie! VINVELA. Yes! I will remember thee; alas! my Shilric will fall! What shall I do, my love! when thou art for ever gone? Through these hills I will go at noon: I will go through the silent heath. There I will see the place of thy rest, returning from the chace. Alas! my Shilric will fall; but I will remember Shilric. And I remember the chief, said the king of woody Morven; he consumed the battle in his rage. But now my eyes behold him not. I met him, one day, on the hill: his cheek was pale; his brow was dark. The sigh was frequent in his breast: his steps were towards the desert. But now he is not in the crowd of my chiefs, when the sounds of my shields arise. Dwells he in the narrow house, the chief of high Carmora! Cronnan! said Ullin of other times, raise the song of Shilric; when he returned to his hills, and Vinvela was no more. He leaned on her grey mossy stone; he thought Vinvela lived. He saw her fair moving on the plain: but the bright form lasted not; the sun-beam fled from the field, and she was seen no more. Hear the song of Shilric, it is soft, but sad! I sit by the mossy fountain; on the top of the hill of winds. One tree is rustling above me. Dark waves roll over the heath. The lake is troubled below. The deer descend from the hill. No hunter at a distance is seen. It is mid-day; but all is silent. Sad are my thoughts alone. Didst thou but appear, O my love, a wanderer on the heath! thy hair floating on the wind behind thee; thy bosom heaving on the sight; thine eyes full of tears for thy friends, whom the mist of the hill had concealed! Thee I would comfort, my love, and bring thee to thy father's house. But is it she that there appears, like a beam of light on the heath? bright as the moon in autumn, as the sun in a summer-storm, comest thou, O maid, over rocks, over mountains to me? She speaks; but how weak her voice! like the breeze in the reeds of the lake. “Returnest thou safe from the war? Where are thy friends, my love? I heard of thy death on the hill; I heard, and mourned thee, Shilric! Yes, my fair, I return; but I alone of my race. Thou shalt see them no more; their graves I raised on the plain. But why art thou on the desert hill? Why on the heath alone?” “Alone I am, O Shilric! alone in the winter-house. With grief for thee I fell. Shilric, I am pale in the tomb.” She fleets, she sails away; as mist before the wind! and, wilt thou not stay, Vinvela? Stay and behold my tears! fair thou appearest, Vinvela! fair thou wast when alive! By the mossy fountain I will sit; on the top of the hill of winds. When mid-day is silent around, O talk with me, Vinvela! come on the light-winged gale! on the breeze of the desert, come! Let me hear thy voice, as thou passest, when mid-day is silent around! Such was the song of Cronnan, on the night of Selma's joy. But morning rose in the east; the blue waters rolled in light. Fingal bade his sails to rise; the winds came rustling from their hills. Inistore rose to sight, and Carric-thura's mossy towers! But the sign of distress was on their top: the warning flame edged with smoke. The king of Morven struck his breast: he assumed, at once, his spear. His darkened brow bends forward to the coast: he looks back to the lagging winds. His hair is disordered on his back. The silence of the king is terrible! Night came down on the sea; Rotha's bay received the ship. A rock bends along the coast with all its echoing wood. On the top is the circle of Loda, the mossy stone of power! A narrow plain spreads beneath, covered with grass and aged trees, which the midnight winds, in their wrath, had torn from the shaggy rock. The blue course of a stream is there! the lonely blast of ocean pursues the thistle's beard. The flame of three oaks arose; the feast is spread around: but the soul of the king is sad, for Carric-thura's chief distrest. The wan, cold moon rose, in the east. Sleep descended on the youths! Their blue helmets glitter to the beam; the fading fire decays. But sleep did not rest on the king; he rose in the midst of his arms, and slowly ascended the hill to behold the flame of Sarno's tower. The flame was dim and distant; the moon hid her red face in the east. A blast came from the mountain; on its wings was the spirit of Loda. He came to his place in his terrors, and shook his dusky spear. His eyes appeared like flames in his dark face; his voice is like distant thunder. Fingal advanced his spear in night, and raised his voice on high. Son of night retire: call thy winds and fly! Why dost thou come to my presence, with thy shadowy arms? Do I fear thy gloomy form, spirit of dismal Loda? Weak is thy shield of clouds; feeble is that meteor, thy sword. The blast rolls them together; and thou thyself art lost. Fly from my presence, son of night! call thy winds and fly! “Dost thou force me from my place,” replied the hollow voice? “The people bend before me. I turn the battle in the field of the brave. I look on the nations and they vanish: my nostrils pour the blast of death. I come abroad on the winds: the tempests are before my face. But my dwelling is calm, above the clouds; the fields of my rest are pleasant.” “Dwell in thy pleasant fields,” said the king. “Let Comhal's son be forgot. Do my steps ascend from my hills, into thy peaceful plains? Do I meet thee with a spear, on thy cloud, spirit of dismal Loda? Why then dost thou frown on me? why shake thine airy spear? Thou frownest in vain: I never fled from the mighty in war. And shall the sons of the wind frighten the king of Morven? No: he knows the weakness of their arms!” “Fly to thy land,” replied the form: “receive the wind and fly! The blasts are in the hollow of my hand: the course of the storm is mine. The king of Sora is my son, he bends at the stone of my power. His battle is around Carric-thura; and he will prevail! Fly to thy land, son of Comhal, or feel my flaming wrath!” He lifted high his shadowy spear! He bent forward his dreadful height. Fingal, advancing, drew his sword; the blade of dark-brown Luno. The gleaming path of the steel winds through the gloomy ghost. The form fell shapeless into air, like a column of smoke, which the staff of the boy disturbs, as it rises from the half-extinguished furnace. The spirit of Loda shrieked, as, rolled into himself, he rose on the wind. Inistore shook at the sound. The waves heard it on the deep. They stopped in their course with fear: the friends of Fingal started, at once; they took their heavy spears. They missed the king; they rose in rage; all their arms resound! The moon came forth in the east. Fingal returned in the gleam of his arms. The joy of his youth was great, their souls settled, as a sea from a storm. Ullin raised the song of gladness. The hills of Inistore rejoiced. The flame of the oak arose; and the tales of heroes are told. But Frothal, Sora's wrathful king, sits in sadness beneath a tree. The host spreads around Carric-thura. He looks towards the walls with rage. He longs for the blood of Cathulla, who, once, overcame him in war. When Annir reigned in Sora, the father of car-borne Frothal, a storm arose on the sea, and carried Frothal to Inistore. Three days he feasted in Sarno's halls, and saw the slow rolling eyes of Comala. He loved her, in the flame of youth, and rushed to seize the white-armed maid. Cathulla met the chief. The gloomy battle rose. Frothal was bound in the hall; three days he pined alone. On the fourth, Sarno sent him to his ship, and he returned to his land. But wrath darkened in his soul against the noble Cathulla. When Annir's stone of fame arose, Frothal came in his strength. The battle burned round Carric-thura, and Sarno's mossy walls. Morning rose on Inistore. Frothal struck his dark-brown shield. His chiefs started at the sound; they stood, but their eyes were turned to the sea. They saw Fingal coming in his strength; and first the noble Thubar spoke. “Who comes like the stag of the desert, with all his herd behind him? Frothal, it is a foe! I see his forward spear. Perhaps it is the king of Morven, Fingal, the first of men. His deeds are well known in Lochlin; the blood of his foes is in Starno's halls. Shall I ask the peace of kings? His sword is the bolt of heaven!” “Son of the feeble hand,” said Frothal, “shall my days begin in a cloud? Shall I yield before I have conquered, chief of streamy Tora? The people would say in Sora, Frothal flew forth like a meteor; but a darkness has met him; and his fame is no more. No: Thubar, I will never yield; my fame shall surround me like light. No: I will never yield, chief of streamy Tora!” He went forth with the stream of his people, but they met a rock: Fingal stood unmoved, broken they rolled back from his side. Nor did they safely fly; the spear of the king pursued their steps. The field is covered with heroes. A rising hill preserved the foe. Frothal saw their flight. The rage of his bosom rose. He bent his eyes to the ground, and called the noble Thubar. “Thubar! my people are fled. My fame has ceased to arise. I will fight the king; I feel my burning soul! Send a bard to demand the combat. Speak not against Frothal's words! But, Thubar! I love a maid; she dwells by Thano's stream, the white-bosomed daughter of Herman, Utha with soft-rolling eyes. She feared the low-laid Comala; her secret sighs rose, when I spread the sail. Tell to Utha of harps, that my soul delighted in her!” Such were his words, resolved to fight. The soft sigh of Utha was near! She had followed her hero, in the armour of a man. She rolled her eye on the youth, in secret, from beneath her steel. She saw the bard as he went; the spear fell thrice from her hand! Her loose hair flew on the wind. Her white breast rose, with sighs. She raised her eyes to the king. She would speak, but thrice she failed. Fingal heard the words of the bard; he came in the strength of his steel. They mixed their deathful spears: They raised the gleam of their arms. But the sword of Fingal descended and cut Frothal's shield in twain. His fair side is exposed; half-bent he foresees his death. Darkness gathered on Utha's soul. The tear rolled down her cheek. She rushed to cover the chief with her shield; but a fallen oak met her steps. She fell on her arm of snow; her shield, her helmet flew wide. Her white bosom heaved to the sight; her dark-brown hair is spread on earth. Fingal pitied the white-armed maid! he stayed the uplifted sword. The tear was in the eye of the king, as, bending forward, he spoke. “King of streamy Sora! fear not the sword of Fingal. It was never stained with the blood of the vanquished; it never pierced a fallen foe. Let thy people rejoice by thy native streams. Let the maids of thy love be glad. Why shouldest thou fall in thy youth, king of streamy Sora?” Frothal heard the words of Fingal, and saw the rising maid: they stood in silence, in their beauty; like two young trees of the plain, when the shower of spring is on their leaves, and the loud winds are laid. “Daughter of Herman,” said Frothal, “didst thou come from Tora's streams; didst thou come, in thy beauty, to behold thy warrior low? But he was low before the mighty, maid of the slow-rolling eye! The feeble did not overcome the son of car-borne Annir! Terrible art thou, O king of Morven! in battles of the spear. But, in peace, thou art like the sun, when he looks through a silent shower: the flowers lift their fair heads before him; the gales shake their rustling wings. O that thou wert in Sora! that my feast were spread! The future kings of Sora would see thy arms and rejoice. They would rejoice at the fame of their fathers, who beheld the mighty Fingal!” “Son of Annir,” replied the king, “the fame of Sora's race shall be heard! When chiefs are strong in war, then does the song arise! But if their swords are stretched over the feeble; if the blood of the weak has stained their arms; the bard shall forget them in the song, and their tombs shall not be known. The stranger shall come and build there, and remove the heaped-up earth. An half-worn sword shall rise before him; bending above it he will say, “These are the arms of the chiefs of old, but their names are not in song.” Come thou, O Frothal, to the feast of Inistore; let the maid of thy love be there; let our faces brighten with joy!” Fingal took his spear, moving in the steps of his might. The gates of Carric-thura are opened wide. The feast of shells is spread. The soft sound of music arose. Gladness brightened in the hall. The voice of Ullin was heard; the harp of Selma was strung. Utha rejoiced in his presence, and demanded the song of grief; the big tear hung in her eye, when the soft Crimora spoke. Crimora, the daughter of Rinval, who dwelt at Lotha's roaring stream! The tale was long, but lovely; and pleased the blushing Utha. CRIMORA. Who cometh from the hill, like a cloud tinged with the beam of the west? Whose voice is that, loud as the wind, but pleasant as the harp of Carril? It is my love in the light of steel; but sad is his darkened brow! Live the mighty race of Fingal? or what darkens in Connal's soul? CONNAL. They live. They return from the chace, like a stream of light. The sun is on their shields. Like a ridge of fire they descend the hill. Loud is the voice of the youth! the war, my love, is near! To-morrow the dreadful Dargo comes to try the force of our race. The race of Fingal he defies; the race of battle and wounds! CRIMORA. Connal, I saw his sails like grey mist on the dark-brown wave. They slowly came to land. Connal, many are the warriors of Dargo! CONNAL. Bring me thy father's shield; the bossy, iron shield of Rinval; that shield like the full-orbed moon, when she moves darkened through heaven. CRIMORA. That shield I bring, O Connal; but it did not defend my father. By the spear of Gormar he fell. Thou may'st fall, O Connal! CONNAL. Fall I may! But raise my tomb, Crimora! Grey stones, a mound of earth, shall send my name to other times. Bend thy red eye over my grave, beat thy mournful heaving breast. Though fair thou art, my love, as the light; more pleasant than the gale of the hill; yet I will not here remain. Raise my tomb, Crimora! CRIMORA. Then give me those arms that gleam; that sword, and that spear of steel. I shall meet Dargo with Connal, and aid him in the fight. Farewell, ye rocks of Ardven! ye deer! and ye streams of the hill! We shall return no more. Our tombs are distant far! “And did they return no more?” said Utha's bursting sigh. “Fell the mighty in battle, and did Crimora live? Her steps were lonely; her soul was sad for Connal. Was he not young and lovely; like the beam of the setting sun?” Ullin saw the virgin's tear, he took the softly-trembling harp: the song was lovely, but sad, and silence was in Carric-thura. Autumn is dark on the mountains; grey mist rests on the hills. The whirlwind is heard on the heath. Dark rolls the river through the narrow plain. A tree stands alone on the hill, and marks the slumbering Connal. The leaves whirl round with the wind, and strew the grave of the dead. At times are seen here the ghosts of the departed, when the musing hunter alone stalks slowly over the heath. Who can reach the source of thy race, O Connal? who recount thy fathers? Thy family grew like an oak on the mountain, which meeteth the wind with its lofty head. But now it is torn from the earth. Who shall supply the place of Connal? Here was the din of arms; here the groans of the dying. Bloody are the wars of Fingal! O Connal! it was there thou didst fall. Thine arm was like a storm; thy sword a beam of the sky; thy height, a rock on the plain; thine eyes a furnace of fire. Louder than a storm was thy voice, in the battles of thy steel. Warriors fell by thy sword, as the thistle by the staff of a boy. Dargo the mighty came on, darkening in his rage. His brows were gathered into wrath. His eyes like two caves in a rock. Bright rose their swords on each side; loud was the clang of their steel. The daughter of Rinval was near; Crimora bright in the armour of man; her yellow hair is loose behind, her bow is in her hand. She followed the youth to the war, Connal her much-beloved. She drew the string on Dargo; but erring she pierced her Connal. He falls like an oak on the plain; like a rock from the shaggy hill. What shall she do, hapless maid! He bleeds; her Connal dies! All the night long she cries, and all the day, “O Connal, my love, and my friend!” With grief the sad mourner dies! Earth here incloses the loveliest pair on the hill. The grass grows between the stones of the tomb; I often sit in the mournful shade. The wind sighs through the grass; their memory rushes on my mind. Undisturbed you now sleep together; in the tomb of the mountain you rest alone! “And soft be their rest,” said Utha, “hapless children of streamy Lotha! I will remember them with tears, and my secret song shall rise; when the wind is in the groves of Tora, when the stream is roaring near. Then shall they come on my soul, with all their lovely grief!” Three days feasted the kings: on the fourth their white sails arose. The winds of the north drove Fingal to Morven's woody land. But the spirit of Loda sat, in his cloud, behind the ships of Frothal. He hung forward with all his blasts, and spread the white-bosomed sails. The wounds of his form were not forgot; he still feared the hand of the king! THE SONGS OF SELMA. ARGUMENT. Address to the evening star. An apostrophe to Fingal and his times. Minona sings before the king the song of the unfortunate Colma; and the bards exhibit other specimens of their poetical talents, according to an annual custom established by the monarchs of the ancient Caledonians. Macpherson. Star of descending night! Star of descending night! fair is thy light in the west! thou liftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud: thy steps are stately on thy hill. What dost thou behold in the plain? The stormy winds are laid. The murmur of the torrent comes from afar. Roaring waves climb the distant rock. The flies of evening are on their feeble wings; the hum of their course is on the field. What dost thou behold, fair light? But thou dost smile and depart. The waves come with joy around thee: they bathe thy lovely hair. Farewell, thou silent beam! Let the light of Ossian's soul arise! And it does arise in its strength! I behold my departed friends. Their gathering is on Lora, as in the days of other years. Fingal comes like a watry column of mist; his heroes are around: And see the bards of song, grey-haired Ullin! stately Ryno! Alpin, with the tuneful voice! the soft complaint of Minona! How are ye changed, my friends, since the days of Selma's feast? when we contended, like gales of spring, as they fly along the hill, and bend by turns the feebly-whistling grass. Minona came forth in her beauty; with downcast look and tearful eye. Her hair flew slowly on the blast, that rushed unfrequent from the hill. The souls of the heroes were sad when she raised the tuneful voice. Often had they seen the grave of Salgar, the dark dwelling of white-bosomed Colma. Colma left alone on the hill, with all her voice of song! Salgar promised to come: but the night descended around. Hear the voice of Colma, when she sat alone on the hill! COLMA. It is night; I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms. The wind is heard in the mountain. The torrent pours down the rock. No hut receives me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of winds! Rise, moon! from behind thy clouds. Stars of the night arise. Lead me, some light, to the place, where my love rests from the chace alone! his bow near him, unstrung: his dogs panting around him. But here I must sit alone, by the rock of the mossy stream. The stream and the wind roar aloud. I hear not the voice of my love! Why delays my Salgar, why the chief of the hill, his promise? Here is the rock, and here the tree! here is the roaring stream! Thou didst promise with night to be here. Ah! whither is my Salgar gone? With thee I would fly, from my father; with thee, from my brother of pride. Our race have long been foes; we are not foes, O Salgar! Cease a little while, O wind! stream, be thou silent a while! let my voice be heard around. Let my wanderer hear me! Salgar! it is Colma who calls. Here is the tree, and the rock. Salgar, my love! I am here. Why delayest thou thy coming? Lo! the calm moon comes forth. The flood is bright in the vale. The rocks are grey on the steep. I see him not on the brow. His dogs come not before him, with tidings of his near approach. Here I must sit alone! Who lie on the heath beside me? Are they my love and my brother? Speak to me, O my friends! To Colma they give no reply. Speak to me: I am alone! My soul is tormented with fears! Ah! they are dead! Their swords are red from the fight. O my brother! my brother! why hast thou slain my Salgar? why, O Salgar! hast thou slain my brother? Dear were ye both to me! what shall I say in your praise? Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands! he was terrible in fight. Speak to me; hear my voice; hear me, sons of my love! They are silent; silent for ever! Cold, cold are their breasts of clay! Oh! from the rock on the hill; from the top of the windy steep, speak, ye ghosts of the dead! speak, I will not be afraid! Whither are ye gone to rest? In what cave of the hill shall I find the departed? No feeble voice is on the gale: no answer half-drowned in the storm! I sit in my grief! I wait for morning in my tears! Rear the tomb, ye friends of the dead. Close it not till Colma come. My life flies away like a dream: why should I stay behind? Here shall I rest with my friends, by the stream of the sounding rock. When night comes on the hill; when the loud winds arise; my ghost shall stand in the blast, and mourn the death of my friends. The hunter shall hear from his booth. He shall fear but love my voice! For sweet shall my voice be for my friends: pleasant were her friends to Colma! Such was thy song, Minona, softly-blushing daughter of Torman. Our tears descended for Colma, and our souls were sad! Ullin came with his harp; he gave the song of Alpin. The voice of Alpin was pleasant: the soul of Ryno was a beam of fire! But they had rested in the narrow house: their voice had ceased in Selma. Ullin had returned, one day, from the chace, before the heroes fell. He heard their strife on the hill; their song was soft but sad! They mourned the fall of Morar, first of mortal men! His soul was like the soul of Fingal; his sword like the sword of Oscar. But he fell, and his father mourned: his sister's eyes were full of ears. Minona's eyes were full of tears, the sister of car-borne Morar. She retired from the song of Ullin, like the moon in the west, when she foresees the shower, and hides her fair head in a cloud. I touched the harp, with Ullin; the song of mourning rose! RYNO. The wind and the rain are past: calm is the noon of day. The clouds are divided in heaven. Over the green hills flies the inconstant sun. Red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill. Sweet are thy murmurs, O stream! but more sweet is the voice I hear. It is the voice of Alpin, the son of song, mourning for the dead! Bent is his head of age; red his tearful eye. Alpin, thou son of song, why alone on the silent hill? why complainest thou, as a blast in the wood; as a wave on the lonely shore? ALPIN. My tears, O Ryno! are for the dead; my voice for those that have passed away. Tall thou art on the hill; fair among the sons of the vale. But thou shalt fall like Morar; the mourner shall sit on thy tomb. The hills shall know thee no more; thy bow shall lie in the hall, unstrung! Thou wert swift, O Morar! as a roe on the desert; terrible as a meteor of fire. Thy wrath was as the storm. Thy sword in battle, as lightning in the field. Thy voice was a stream after rain; like thunder on distant hills. Many fell by thy arm; they were consumed in the flames of thy wrath. But when thou didst return from war, how peaceful was thy brow! Thy face was like the sun after rain; like the moon in the silence of night; calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid. Narrow is thy dwelling now! dark the place of thine abode! With three steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great before! Four stones, with their heads of moss, are the only memorial of thee. A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass, which whistles in the wind, mark to the hunter's eye the grave of the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art low indeed. Thou hast no mother to mourn thee: no maid with her tears of love. Dead is she that brought thee forth. Fallen is the daughter of Morglan. Who on his staff is this? who is this, whose head is white with age? whose eyes are red with tears? who quakes at every step? It is thy father, O Morar! the father of no son but thee. He heard of thy fame in war; he heard of foes dispersed. He heard of Morar's renown; why did he not hear of his wound? Weep, thou father of Morar! weep; but thy son heareth thee not. Deep is the sleep of the dead; low their pillow of dust. No more shall he hear thy voice; no more awake at thy call. When shall it be morn in the grave, to bid the slumberer awake? Farewell, thou bravest of men! thou conqueror in the field! but the field shall see thee no more; nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel. Thou hast left no son. The song shall preserve thy name. Future times shall hear of thee; they shall hear of the fallen Morar! The grief of all arose, but most the bursting sigh of Armin. He remembers the death of his son, who fell in the days of his youth. Carmor was near the hero, the chief of the echoing Galmal. Why bursts the sigh of Armin, he said? Is there a cause to mourn? The song comes, with its music, to melt and please the soul. It is like soft mist, that, rising from a lake, pours on the silent vale; the green flowers are filled with dew; but the sun returns in his strength, and the mist is gone. Why art thou sad, O Armin, chief of sea-surrounded Gorma! Sad I am! nor small is my cause of woe! Carmor, thou hast lost no son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty. Colgar the valiant lives; and Annira, fairest maid. The boughs of thy house ascend, O Carmor! but Armin is the last of his race. Dark is thy bed, O Daura! deep thy sleep in the tomb! When shalt thou awake with thy songs? with all thy voice of music? Arise, winds of autumn, arise; blow along the heath! streams of the mountains roar! roar tempests, in the groves of my oaks! walk through broken clouds, O moon! show thy pale face at intervals! bring to my mind the night, when all my children fell; when Arindal the mighty fell; when Daura the lovely failed! Daura, my daughter! thou wert fair; fair as the moon on Fura; white as the driven snow; sweet as the breathing gale. Arindal, thy bow was strong. Thy spear was swift in the field. Thy look was like mist on the wave: thy shield a red cloud in a storm. Armor, renowned in war, came, and sought Daura's love. He was not long refused: fair was the hope of their friends! Erath, son of Odgal, repined: his brother had been slain by Armor. He came disguised like a son of the sea: fair was his skiff on the wave; white his locks of age; calm his serious brow. Fairest of women, he said, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock, not distant in the sea, bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar. There Armar waits for Daura. I come to carry his love! She went; she called on Armar. Nought answered but the son of the rock, Armar, my love! my love! why tormentest thou me with fear? hear, son of Armar, hear: it is Daura who calleth thee! Erath the traitor fled laughing to the land. She lifted up her voice; she called for her brother and her father. Arindal! Armin! none to relieve your Daura! Her voice came over the sea. Arindal, my son, descended from the hill; rough in the spoils of the chace. His arrows rattled by his side; his bow was in his hand, five dark grey dogs attend his steps. He saw fierce Erath on the shore: he seized and bound him to an oak. Thick wind the thongs of the hide around his limbs; he loads the wind with his groans. Arindal ascends the deep in his boat, to bring Daura to land. Armar came in his wrath, and let fly the grey feathered shaft. It sung; it sunk in thy heart, O Arindal my son! for Erath the traitor thou diedst. The oar is stopped at once: he panted on the rock, and expired. What is thy grief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother's blood! The boat is broken in twain. Armar plunges into the sea, to rescue his Daura or die. Sudden a blast from the hill came over the waves. He sunk, and he rose no more. Alone, on the sea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to complain. Frequent and loud were her cries. What could her father do? All night I stood on the shore. I saw her by the faint beam of the moon. All night I heard her cries. Loud was the wind; the rain beat hard on the hill. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak. It died away, like the evening breeze among the grass of the rocks. Spent with grief, she expired; and left thee, Armin, alone. Gone is my strength in war! fallen my pride among women! When the storms aloft arise; when the north lifts the wave on high; I sit by the sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock. Often by the setting moon, I see the ghosts of my children. Half-viewless, they walk in mournful conference together. Will none of you speak in pity? They do not regard their father. I am sad, O Carmor; nor small is my cause of woe! Such were the words of the bards in the days of song; when the king heard the music of harps, the tales of other times! The chiefs gathered from all their hills, and heard the lovely sound. They praised the voice of Cona! the first among a thousand bards! But age is now on my tongue; my soul has failed! I hear, at times, the ghosts of bards, and learn their pleasant song. But memory fails on my mind. I hear the call of years! They say, as they pass along, why does Ossian sing? Soon shall he lie in the narrow house, and no bard shall raise his fame! Roll on, ye dark-brown years; ye bring no joy on your course! Let the tomb open to Ossian; for his strength has failed. The sons of song are gone to rest. My voice remains, like a blast, that roars, lonely, on a sea-surrounded rock, after the winds are laid. The dark moss whistles there; the distant mariner sees the waving-trees! CALTHON AND COLMAL: A POEM. ARGUMENT. This piece, as many more of Ossian's compositions, is addressed to one of the first Christian missionaries. The story of the poem is handed down, by tradition, thus. In the country of the Britons between the walls, two chiefs lived in the days of Fingal, Dunthalmo, lord of Teutha, supposed to be the Tweed; and Rathmor, who dwelt at Clutha, well known to be the river Clyde. Rathmor was not more renowned for his generosity and hospitality, than Dunthalmo was infamous for his cruelty and ambition. Dunthalmo, through envy, or on account of some private feuds, which subsisted between the families, murdered Rathmor at a feast; but being afterwards touched with remorse, he educated the two sons of Rathmor, Calthon and Colmar, in his own house. They growing up to man's estate, dropped some hints that they intended to revenge the death of their father, upon which Dunthalmo shut them up in two caves on the banks of Teutha, intending to take them off privately. Colmal, the daughter of Dunthalmo, who was secretly in love with Calthon, helped him to make his escape from prison, and fled with him to Fingal, disguised in the habit of a young warrior, and implored his aid against Dunthalmo. Fingal sent Ossian with three hundred men, to Colmar's relief. Dunthalmo having previously murdered Colmar, came to a battle with Ossian; but he was killed by that hero, and his army totally defeated. Calthon married Colmal, his deliverer; and Ossian returned to Morven. Macpherson. Pleasant is the voice of thy song Pleasant is the voice of thy song, thou lonely dweller of the rock. It comes on the sound of the stream, along the narrow vale. My soul awakes, O stranger! in the midst of my hall. I stretch my hand to the spear, as in the days of other years. I stretch my hand; but it is feeble: and the sigh of my bosom grows. Wilt thou not listen, son of the rock, to the song of Ossian? My soul is full of other times; the joy of my youth returns. Thus the sun appears in the west, after the steps of his brightness have moved behind a storm; the green hills lift their dewy heads: the blue streams rejoice in the vale. The aged hero comes forth on his staff; his grey hair glitters in the beam. Dost thou not behold, son of the rock, a shield in Ossian's hall? It is marked with the strokes of battle; and the brightness of its bosses has failed. That shield the great Dunthalmo bore, the chief of streamy Teutha. Dunthalmo bore it in battle before he fell by Ossian's spear. Listen, son of the rock, to the tale of other years! Rathmor was a chief of Clutha. The feeble dwelt in his hall. The gates of Rathmor were never shut; his feast was always spread. The sons of the stranger came. They blessed the generous chief of Clutha. Bards raised the song, and touched the harp: joy brightened on the face of the sad! Dunthalmo came, in his pride, and rushed into the combat of Rathmor. The chief of Clutha overcame: the rage of Dunthalmo rose. He came, by night, with his warriors; the mighty Rathmor fell. He fell in his halls, where his feast was often spread for strangers. Colmar and Calthon were young, the sons of car-borne Rathmor. They came, in the joy of youth, into their father's hall. They beheld him in his blood; their bursting tears descend. The soul of Dunthalmo melted, when he saw the children of youth. He brought them to Alteutha's walls; they grew in the house of their foe. They bent the bow in his presence; and came forth to his wars. They saw the fallen walls of their fathers; they saw the green thorn in the hall. Their tears rushed forth in secret. At times their faces were sad. Dunthalmo beheld their grief: his darkening soul designed their death. He closed them in two caves, on the echoing banks of Teutha. The sun did not come there with his beams; nor the moon of heaven by night. The sons of Rathmor remained in darkness, and foresaw their death. The daughter of Dunthalmo wept in silence, the fair-haired, blue-eyed Colmal. Her eye had rolled in secret on Calthon; his loveliness swelled in her soul. She trembled for her warrior; But what could Colmal do? Her arm could not lift the spear; nor was the sword formed for her side. Her white breast never rose beneath a mail. Neither was her eye the terror of heroes. What canst thou do, O Colmal! for the falling chief? Her steps are unequal; her hair is loose: her eye looks wildly through her tears. She came, by night, to the hall. She armed her lovely form in steel; the steel of a young warrior, who fell in the midst of his battles. She came to the cave of Calthon, and loosed the thong from his hands. “Arise, son of Rathmor,” she said, “arise, the night is dark! Let us fly to the king of Selma, chief of fallen Clutha! I am the son of Lamgal, who dwelt in thy father's hall. I heard of thy dark dwelling in the cave, and my soul arose. Arise, son of Rathmor, arise, the night is dark!” “Blest voice!” replied the chief, “comest thou from the clouds to Calthon! The ghosts of his fathers have often descended in his dreams, since the sun has retired from his eyes, and darkness has dwelt around him. Or art thou the son of Lamgal, the chief I often saw in Clutha? But shall I fly to Fingal, and Colmar my brother low? Will I fly to Morven, and the hero closed in night? No: give me that spear, son of Lamgal, Calthon will defend his brother!” “A thousand warriors,” replied the maid, “stretch their spears round car-borne Colmar. What can Calthon do against a host so great? Let us fly to the king of Morven, he will come with war. His arm is stretched forth to the unhappy; the lightning of his sword is round the weak. Arise, thou son of Rathmor; the shadows will fly away. Arise, or thy steps may be seen, and thou must fall in youth!” The sighing hero rose; his tears descend for car-borne Colmar. He came with the maid to Selma's hall; but he knew not that it was Colmal. The helmet covered her lovely face. Her bosom heaved beneath the steel. Fingal returned from the chace, and found the lovely strangers. They were like two beams of light, in the midst of the hall of shells. The king heard the tale of grief; and turned his eyes around. A thousand heroes half-rose before him; claiming the war of Teutha. I came with my spear from the hill; the joy of battle rose in my breast: for the king spoke to Ossian in the midst of a thousand chiefs. “Son of my strength,” began the king, “take thou the spear of Fingal. Go to Teutha's rushing stream, and save the car-borne Colmar. Let thy fame return before thee like a pleasant gale; that my soul may rejoice over my son, who renews the renown of our fathers. Ossian! be thou a storm in war; but mild when the foe is low! It was thus my fame arose, O my son; be thou like Selma's chief. When the haughty come to my halls, my eyes behold them not. But my arm is stretched forth to the unhappy. My sword defends the weak.” I rejoiced in the words of the king. I took my rattling arms. Diaran rose at my side, and Dargo, king of spears. Three hundred youths followed our steps: the lovely strangers were at my side. Dunthalmo heard the sound of our approach. He gathered the strength of Teutha. He stood on a hill with his host. They were like rocks broken with thunder, when their bent trees are singed and bare, and the streams of their chinks have failed. The stream of Teutha rolled, in its pride, before the gloomy foe. I sent a bard to Dunthalmo, to offer the combat on the plain; but he smiled in the darkness of his pride. His unsettled host moved on the hill; like the mountain-cloud, when the blast has entered its womb, and scatters the curling gloom on every side. They brought Colmar to Teutha's bank, bound with a thousand thongs. The chief is sad, but stately. His eye is on his friends; for we stood, in our arms, whilst Teutha's waters rolled between. Dunthalmo came with his spear, and pierced the hero's side: he rolled on the bank in his blood. We heard his broken sighs. Calthon rushed into the stream: I bounded forward on my spear. Teutha's race fell before us. Night came rolling down. Dunthalmo rested on a rock, amidst an aged wood. The rage of his bosom burned against the car-borne Calthon. But Calthon stood in his grief; he mourned the fallen Colmar; Colmar slain in youth, before his fame arose! I bade the song of woe to rise, to sooth the mournful chief; but he stood beneath a tree, and often threw his spear on earth. The humid eye of Colmal rolled near in a secret tear: she foresaw the fall of Dunthalmo, or of Clutha's warlike chief. Now half the night had passed away. Silence and darkness were on the field. Sleep rested on the eyes of the heroes: Calthon's settling soul was still. His eyes were half-closed; but the murmur of Teutha had not yet failed in his ear. Pale, and shewing his wounds, the ghost of Colmar came: he bent his head over the hero, and raised his feeble voice. “Sleeps the son of Rathmor in his night, and his brother low? Did we not rise to the chace together? Pursued we not the dark-brown hinds? Colmar was not forgot till he fell: till death had blasted his youth. I lie pale beneath the rock of Lona. O let Calthon rise! the morning comes with its beams: Dunthalmo will dishonour the fallen. He passed away in his blast. The rising Calthon saw the steps of his departure. He rushed in the sound of his steel. Unhappy Colmal rose. She followed her hero through night, and dragged her spear behind. But when Calthon came to Lona's rock, he found his fallen brother. The rage of his bosom rose; he rushed among the foe. The groans of death ascend. They close around the chief. He is bound in the midst, and brought to gloomy Dunthalmo. The shout of joy arose; and the hills of night replied. I started at the sound: and took my father's spear. Diaran rose at my side; and the youthful strength of Dargo. We missed the chief of Clutha, and our souls were sad. I dreaded the departure of my fame. The pride of my valour rose! “Sons of Morven,” I said, “it is not thus our fathers fought. They rested not on the field of strangers, when the foe was not fallen before them. Their strength was like the eagles of heaven; their renown is in the song. But our people fall by degrees. Our fame begins to depart. What shall the king of Morven say, if Ossian conquers not at Teutha? Rise in your steel, ye warriors; follow the sound of Ossian's course. He will not return, but renowned, to the echoing walls of Selma.” Morning rose on the blue waters of Teutha. Colmal stood before me in tears. She told of the chief of Clutha: thrice the spear fell from her hand. My wrath turned against the stranger; for my soul trembled for Calthon. “Son of the feeble hand,” I said, “do Teutha's warriors fight with tears? The battle is not won with grief; nor dwells the sigh in the soul of war. Go to the deer of Carmun, to the lowing herds of Teutha. But leave these arms, thou son of fear. A warrior may lift them in fight.” I tore the mail from her shoulders. Her snowy breast appeared. She bent her blushing face to the ground. I looked in silence to the chiefs. The spear fell from my hand; the sigh of my bosom rose! But when I heard the name of the maid, my crowding tears rushed down. I blessed the lovely beam of youth, and bade the battle move! Why, son of the rock, should Ossian tell how Teutha's warriors died? They are now forgot in their land; their tombs are not found on the heath. Years came on with their storms. The green mounds are mouldered away. Scarce is the grave of Dunthalmo seen, or the place where he fell by the spear of Ossian. Some grey warrior, half blind with age, sitting by night at the flaming oak of the hall, tells now my deeds to his sons, and the fall of the dark Dunthalmo. The faces of youth bend sidelong towards his voice. Surprize and joy burn in their eyes! I found Calthon bound to an oak, my sword cut the thongs from his hands. I gave him the white-bosomed Colmal. They dwelt in the halls of Teutha. LATHMON: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Lathmon, a British prince, taking advantage of Fingal's absence on an expedition in Ireland, made a descent on Morven, and advanced within sight of Selma, the royal residence. Fingal arrived in the mean time, and Lathmon retreated to a hill, where his army was surprised by night, and himself taken prisoner by Ossian and Gaul, the son of Morni. The poem opens with the first appearance of Fingal on the coast of Morven, and ends, it may be supposed, about noon the next day. Macpherson. Selma, thy halls are silent. Selma, thy halls are silent. There is no sound in the woods of Morven. The wave tumbles alone on the coast. The silent beam of the sun is on the field. The daughters of Morven come forth, like the bow of the shower; they look towards green Erin for the white sails of the king. He had promised to return, but the winds of the north arose! Who pours from the eastern hill, like a stream of darkness? It is the host of Lathmon. He has heard of the absence of Fingal. He trusts in the wind of the north. His soul brightens with joy. Why dost thou come, O Lathmon? The mighty are not in Selma. Why comest thou with thy forward spear? Will the daughters of Morven fight? But stop, O mighty stream, in thy course! Does not Lathmon behold these sails? Why dost thou vanish, Lathmon, like the mist of the lake? But the squally storm is behind thee: Fingal pursues thy steps! The king of Morven had started from sleep, as we rolled on the dark-blue wave. He stretched his hand to the spear, his heroes rose around. We knew that he had seen his fathers, for they often descended to his dreams, when the sword of the foe rose over the land; and the battle darkened before us. “Whither hast thou fled, O wind!” said the king of Morven. “Dost thou rustle in the chambers of the south, pursuest thou the shower in other lands? Why dost thou not come to my sails? to the blue face of my seas? The foe is in the land of Morven, and the king is absent far. But let each bind on his mail, and each assume his shield. Stretch every spear over the wave: let every sword be unsheathed. Lathmon is before us with his host; he that fled from Fingal on the plains of Lona. But he returns, like a collected stream, and his roar is between our hills. Such were the words of Fingal. We rushed into Carmona's bay. Ossian ascended the hill: He thrice struck his bossy shield. The rock of Morven replied; the bounding roes came forth. The foe was troubled in my presence: he collected his darkened host. I stood, like a cloud on the hill, rejoicing in the arms of my youth. Morni sat beneath a tree, at the roaring waters of Strumon: his locks of age are grey: he leans forward on his staff; young Gaul is near the hero, hearing the battles of his father. Often did he rise, in the fire of his soul, at the mighty deeds of Morni. The aged heard the sound of Ossian's shield: he knew the sign of war. He started at once from his place. His grey hair parted on his back. He remembered the deeds of other years. “My son,” he said to fair-haired Gaul, “I hear the sound of war. The king of Morven is returned, his signals are spread on the wind. Go to the halls of Strumon; bring his arms to Morni. Bring the shield of my father's latter years; for my arm begins to fail. Take thou thy armour, O Gaul, and rush to the first of thy battles. Let thine arm reach to the renown of thy fathers. Be thy course in the field, like the eagle's wing. Why shouldst thou fear death, my son? the valiant fall with fame; their shields turn the dark stream of danger away; renown dwells on their aged hairs. Dost thou not see, O Gaul, how the steps of my age are honoured? Morni moves forth, and the young meet him, with awe, and turn their eyes, with silent joy, on his course. But I never fled from danger, my son! my sword lightened through the darkness of war. The stranger melted before me; the mighty were blasted in my presence.” Gaul brought the arms to Morni: the aged warrior is covered with steel. He took the spear in his hand, which was stained with the blood of the valiant. He came towards Fingal, his son attended his steps. The son of Comhal arose before him with joy, when he came in his locks of age. “Chief of roaring Strumon!” said the rising soul of Fingal, “do I behold thee in arms, after thy strength has failed? Often has Morni shone in fight, like the beam of the ascending sun; when he disperses the storms of the hill, and brings peace to the glittering fields. But why didst thou not rest in thine age? Thy renown is in the song. The people behold thee, and bless the departure of mighty Morni. Why didst thou not rest in thine age! The foe will vanish before Fingal!” “Son of Comhal,” replied the chief, “the strength of Morni's arm has failed. I attempt to draw the sword of my youth, but it remains in its place. I throw the spear, but it falls short of the mark. I feel the weight of my shield. We decay like the grass of the hill: our strength returns no more. I have a son, O Fingal, his soul has delighted in Morni's deeds; but his sword has not been lifted against a foe, neither has his fame begun. I come with him to war; to direct his arm in fight. His renown will be a light to my soul, in the dark hour of my departure. O that the name of Morni were forgot among the people! that the heroes would only say, “Behold the father of Gaul!” “King of Strumon,” Fingal replied, “Gaul shall lift the sword in fight. But he shall lift it before Fingal; my arm shall defend his youth. But rest thou in the halls of Selma, and hear of our renown. Bid the harp to be strung; and the voice of the bard to arise, that those who fall may rejoice in their fame; and the soul of Morni brighten with joy. Ossian! thou hast fought in battles: the blood of strangers is on thy spear: thy course be with Gaul, in the strife; but depart not from the side of Fingal! lest the foe should find you alone, and your fame fail in my presence.” I saw Gaul in his arms; my soul was mixed with his. The fire of the battle was in his eyes! he looked to the foe with joy. We spoke the words of friendship in secret; the lightning of our swords poured together; for we drew them behind the wood, and tried the strength of our arms on the empty air. Night came down on Morven. Fingal sat at the beam of the oak. Morni sat at his side, with all his grey waving locks. Their words were of other times, of the mighty deeds of their fathers. Three bards, at times, touch the harp; Ullin was near with his song. He sung of the mighty Comhal; but darkness gathered on Morni's brow. He rolled his red eye on Ullin: at once ceased the song of the bard. Fingal observed the aged hero, and he mildly spoke. “Chief of Strumon, why that darkness? Let the days of other years be forgot. Our fathers contended in war; but we meet together at the feast. Our swords are turned on the foe of our land: he melts before us on the field. Let the days of our fathers be forgot, hero of mossy Strumon!” “King of Morven,” replied the chief, “I remember thy father with joy. He was terrible in battle; the rage of the chief was deadly. My eyes were full of tears, when the king of heroes fell. The valiant fall, O Fingal! the feeble remain on the hills! How many heroes have passed away, in the days of Morni! Yet I did not shun the battle; neither did I fly from the strife of the valiant. Now let the friends of Fingal rest; for the night is around; that they may rise, with strength, to battle against car-borne Lathmon. I hear the sound of his host, like thunder moving on the hills. Ossian! and fair-haired Gaul! ye are young and swift in the race. Observe the foes of Fingal from that woody hill. But approach them not, your fathers are not near to shield you. Let not your fame fall at once. The valour of youth may fail!” We heard the words of the chief with joy. We moved in the clang of our arms. Our steps are on the woody hill. Heaven burns with all its stars. The meteors of death fly over the field. The distant noise of the foe reached our ears. It was then Gaul spoke, in his valour: his hand half-unsheathed the sword. “Son of Fingal,” he said, “why burns the soul of Gaul? My heart beats high. My steps are disordered; my hand trembles on my sword. When I look towards the foe, my soul lightens before me. I see their sleeping host. Tremble thus the souls of the valiant in battles of the spear? How would the soul of Morni rise, if we should rush on the foe! Our renown would grow in song: Our steps would be stately in the eyes of the brave.” “Son of Morni,” I replied, “my soul delights in war. I delight to shine in battle alone, to give my name to the bards. But what if the foe should prevail; can I behold the eyes of the king! They are terrible in his displeasure, and like the flames of death. But I will not behold them in his wrath! Ossian shall prevail, or fall. But shall the fame of the vanquished rise? They pass like a shade away. But the fame of Ossian shall rise! His deeds shall be like his father's. Let us rush in our arms; son of Morni, let us rush to fight. Gaul! if thou should'st return, go to Selma's lofty hall. Tell to Evirallin, that I fell with fame; carry this sword to Branno's daughter. Let her give it to Oscar, when the years of his youth shall arise.” “Son of Fingal,” Gaul replied, with a sigh; “shall I return after Ossian is low? What would my father say, what Fingal the king of men? The feeble would turn their eyes, and say, “Behold Gaul, who left his friend in his blood!” Ye shall not behold me, ye feeble, but in the midst of my renown. Ossian! I have heard from my father the mighty deeds of heroes; their mighty deeds when alone; for the soul increases in danger.” “Son of Morni,” I replied, and strode before him on the heath, “our fathers shall praise our valour, when they mourn our fall. A beam of gladness shall rise on their souls, when their eyes are full of tears. They will say, “Our sons have not fallen unknown: they spread death around them.” But why should we think of the narrow house? The sword defends the brave. But death pursues the flight of the feeble; their renown is never heard.” We rushed forward through night; we came to the roar of a stream, which bent its blue course round the foe, through trees that echoed to its sound. We came to the bank of the stream, and saw the sleeping host. Their fires were decayed on the plain; the lonely steps of their scouts were distant far. I stretched my spear before me, to support my steps over the stream. But Gaul took my hand, and spoke the words of the brave. “Shall the son of Fingal rush on the sleeping foe? Shall he come like a blast by night, when it overturns the young trees in secret? Fingal did not thus receive his fame, nor dwells renown on the grey hairs of Morni, for actions like these. Strike, Ossian, strike the shield, and let their thousands rise. Let them meet Gaul in his first battle, that he may try the strength of his arm.” My soul rejoiced over the warrior; my bursting tears came down. “And the foe shall meet thee, Gaul!” I said; “the fame of Morni's son shall arise. But rush not too far, my hero; let the gleam of thy steel be near to Ossian. Let our hands join in slaughter. Gaul! dost thou not behold that rock? Its grey side dimly gleams to the stars. Should the foe prevail, let our back be towards the rock. Then shall they fear to approach our spears; for death is in our hands!” I struck thrice my echoing shield. The starting foe arose. We rushed on in the sound of our arms. Their crowded steps fly over the heath. They thought that the mighty Fingal was come. The strength of their arms withered away. The sound of their flight was like that of flame, when it rushes through the blasted groves. It was then the spear of Gaul flew in its strength; it was then his sword arose. Cremor fell; and mighty Leth. Dunthormo struggled in his blood. The steel rushed through Crotho's side, as bent, he rose on his spear; the black stream poured from the wound, and hissed on the half-extinguished oak. Cathmin saw the steps of the hero behind him; he ascended a blasted tree; but the spear pierced him from behind. Shrieking, panting, he fell. Moss and withered branches pursue his fall, and strew the blue arms of Gaul. Such were thy deeds, son of Morni, in the first of thy battles. Nor slept the sword by thy side, thou last of Fingal's race! Ossian rushed forward in his strength; the people fell before him; as the grass by the staff of the boy, when he whistles along the field, and the grey beard of the thistle falls. But careless the youth moves on; his steps are towards the desert. Grey morning rose around us; the winding streams are bright along the heath. The foe gathered on a hill; and the rage of Lathmon rose. He bent the red eye of his wrath: he is silent in his rising grief. He often struck his bossy shield; and his steps are unequal on the heath. I saw the distant darkness of the hero, and I spoke to Morni's son. Car-borne chief of Strumon, dost thou behold the foe? They gather on the hill in their wrath. Let our steps be towards the king. He shall rise in his strength, and the host of Lathmon vanish. Our fame is around us, warrior; the eyes of the aged will rejoice. But let us fly, son of Morni, Lathmon descends the hill. “Then let our steps be slow,” replied the fair-haired Gaul, “lest the foe say, with a smile, “Behold the warriors of night. They are, like ghosts, terrible in darkness; they melt away before the beam of the east. Ossian, take the shield of Gormar, who fell beneath thy spear. The aged heroes will rejoice, beholding the deeds of their sons.” Such were our words on the plain, when Sulmath came to car-borne Lathmon: Sulmath, chief of Dutha, at the dark-rolling stream of Duvranna. “Why dost thou not rush, son of Nuäth, with a thousand of thy heroes? Why dost thou not descend with thy host, before the warriors fly? Their blue arms are beaming to the rising light, and their steps are before us on the heath!” “Son of the feeble hand,” said Lathmon, “shall my host descend! They are but two, son of Dutha; shall a thousand lift their steel! Nuäth would mourn, in his hall, for the departure of his fame. His eyes would turn from Lathmon, when the tread of his feet approached. Go thou to the heroes, chief of Dutha. I behold the stately steps of Ossian. His fame is worthy of my steel! let us contend in fight.” The noble Sulmath came. I rejoiced in the words of the king. I raised the shield on my arm; Gaul placed in my hand the sword of Morni. We returned to the murmuring stream; Lathmon came down in his strength. His dark host rolled, like clouds, behind him: but the son of Nuäth was bright in his steel! “Son of Fingal,” said the hero, “thy fame has grown on our fall. How many lie there of my people by thy hand, thou king of men! Lift now thy spear against Lathmon; lay the son of Nuäth low! Lay him low among his warriors, or thou thyself must fall! It shall never be told in my halls, that my people fell in my presence; that they fell in the presence of Lathmon, when his sword rested by his side: the blue eyes of Cutha would roll in tears; her steps be lonely in the vales of Dunlathmon!” “Neither shall it be told,” I replied, “that the son of Fingal fled. Were his steps covered with darkness, yet would not Ossian fly! his soul would meet him, and say, “Does the bard of Selma fear the foe?” No: he does not fear the foe. His joy is in the midst of battle!” Lathmon came on with his spear. He pierced the shield of Ossian. I felt the cold steel by my side. I drew the sword of Morni. I cut the spear in twain. The bright point fell glittering on earth. The son of Nuäth burnt in his wrath. He lifted high his sounding shield. His dark eyes rolled above it, as bending forward, it shone like a gate of brass! But Ossian's spear pierced the brightness of his bosses, and sunk in a tree that rose behind. The shield hung on the quivering lance! but Lathmon still advanced! Gaul foresaw the fall of the chief. He stretched his buckler before my sword; when it descended, in a stream of light, over the king of Dunlathmon! Lathmon beheld the son of Morni. The tear started from his eye. He threw the sword of his fathers on earth, and spoke the words of the brave. “Why should Lathmon fight against the first of men? Your souls are beams from heaven; your swords the flames of death! Who can equal the renown of the heroes, whose deeds are so great in youth? O that ye were in the halls of Nuäth, in the green dwelling of Lathmon! then would my father say, that his son did not yield to the weak! But who comes, a mighty stream, along the echoing heath? the little hills are troubled before him; a thousand ghosts are on the beams of his steel; the ghosts of those who are to fall, by the arm of the king of resounding Morven. Happy art thou, O Fingal, thy sons shall fight thy wars. They go forth before thee; they return with the steps of their renown!” Fingal came, in his mildness, rejoicing in secret over the deeds of his son. Morni's face brightened with gladness; his aged eyes look faintly through tears of joy. We came to the halls of Selma. We sat around the feast of shells. The maids of song came into our presence, and the mildly blushing Evirallin! Her hair spreads on her neck of snow; her eye rolls, in secret, on Ossian. She touched the harp of music; we blessed the daughter of Branno. Fingal rose in his place, and spoke to Lathmon, king of spears. The sword of Trenmor shook by his side, as high he raised his mighty arm. “Son of Nuäth,” he said, “why dost thou search for fame on Morven? We are not of the race of the feeble; our swords gleam not over the weak. When did we rouse thee, O Lathmon, with the sound of war? Fingal does not delight in battle, though his arm is strong! My renown grows on the fall of the haughty. The light of my steel pours on the proud in arms. The battle comes; and the tombs of the valiant rise; the tombs of my people rise, O my fathers! I at last must remain alone! But I will remain renowned; the departure of my soul shall be a stream of light. Lathmon! retire to thy place! Turn thy battles to other lands! The race of Morven are renowned; their foes are the sons of the unhappy!” OITHONA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Gaul, the son of Morni, attended Lathmon into his own country, after his being defeated in Morven, as related in the preceding poem. He was kindly entertained by Nuäth, the father of Lathmon, and fell in love with his daughter Oithona. The lady was no less enamoured of Gaul, and a day was fixed for their marriage. In the mean time Fingal, preparing for an expedition into the country of the Britons, sent for Gaul. He obeyed, and went; but not without promising to Oithona to return, if he survived the war, by a certain day. Lathmon too was obliged to attend his father Nuäth in his wars, and Oithona was left alone at Dunlathmon, the seat of the family. Dunrommath, lord of Uthal, supposed to be one of the Orkneys, taking advantage of the absence of her friends, came and carried off, by force, Oithona, who had formerly rejected his love, into Tromathon, a desert island, where he concealed her in a cave. Gaul returned on the day appointed; heard of the rape, and sailed to Tromathon, to revenge himself on Dunrommath. When he landed, he found Oithona disconsolate, and resolved not to survive the loss of her honour. She told him the story of her misfortunes, and she scarce ended, when Dunrommath, with his followers, appeared at the further end of the island. Gaul prepared to attack him, recommending to Oithona to retire, till the battle was over. She seemingly obeyed; but she secretly armed herself, rushed into the thickest of the battle, and was mortally wounded. Gaul, pursuing the flying enemy, found her just expiring on the field: he mourned over her, raised her tomb, and returned to Morven. Thus is the story handed down by tradition; nor is it given with any material difference in the poem, which opens with Gaul's return to Dunlathmon, after the rape of Oithona. Macpherson. Darkness dwells around Dunlathmon Darkness dwells around Dunlathmon, though the moon shews half her face on the hill. The daughter of night turns her eyes away; she beholds the approaching grief. The son of Morni is on the plain: there is no sound in the hall. No long-streaming beam of light comes trembling through the gloom. The voice of Oithona is not heard amidst the noise of the streams of Duvranna. “Whither art thou gone in thy beauty, dark-haired daughter of Nuäth? Lathmon is in the field of the valiant, but thou didst promise to remain in the hall; thou didst promise to remain in the hall till the son of Morni returned. Till he returned from Strumon, to the maid of his love! the tear was on thy cheek at his departure; the sigh rose in secret in thy breast. But thou dost not come forth with songs, with the lightly-trembling sound of the harp!” Such were the words of Gaul, when he came to Dunlathmon's towers. The gates were open and dark. The winds were blustering in the hall. The trees strowed the threshold with leaves; the murmur of night was abroad. Sad and silent, at a rock, the son of Morni sat: his soul trembled for the maid; but he knew not whither to turn his course! The son of Leth stood at a distance, and heard the winds in his bushy hair. But he did not raise his voice, for he saw the sorrow of Gaul! Sleep descended on the chiefs. The visions of night arose. Oithona stood, in a dream, before the eyes of Morni's son. Her hair was loose and disordered: her lovely eye rolled deep in tears. Blood stained her snowy arm. The robe half hid the wound in her breast. She stood over the chief, and her voice was feebly heard. “Sleeps the son of Morni, he that was lovely in the eyes of Oithona? Sleeps Gaul at the distant rock, and the daughter of Nuäth low? The sea rolls round the dark isle of Tromathon. I sit in my tears in the cave! Nor do I sit alone, O Gaul, the dark chief of Cuthal is there. He is there in the rage of his love. What can Oithona do?” A rougher blast rushed through the oak. The dream of night departed. Gaul took his aspen spear. He stood in the rage of his soul. Often did his eyes turn to the east. He accused the lagging light. At length the morning came forth. The hero lifted up the sail. The winds came rustling from the hill; he bounded on the waves of the deep. On the third day arose Tromathon, like a blue shield in the midst of the sea. The white wave roared against its rocks; sad Oithona sat on the coast! She looked on the rolling waters, and her tears came down. But when she saw Gaul in his arms, she started and turned her eyes away. Her lovely cheek is bent and red; her white arm trembles by her side. Thrice she strove to fly from his presence; thrice her steps failed her as she went! “Daughter of Nuäth,” said the hero, “why dost thou fly from Gaul. Do my eyes send forth the flame of death? Darkens hatred in my soul? Thou art to me the beam of the east, rising in a land unknown. But thou coverest thy face with sadness, daughter of car-borne Nuäth! Is the foe of Oithona near? My soul burns to meet him in fight. The sword trembles by the side of Gaul, and longs to glitter in his hand. Speak, daughter of Nuäth, dost thou not behold my tears!” “Young chief of Strumon,” replied the maid, “why comest thou over the dark-blue wave, to Nuäth's mournful daughter? Why did I not pass away in secret, like the flower of the rock, that lifts its fair head unseen, and strows its withered leaves on the blast? Why didst thou come, O Gaul, to hear my departing sigh? I vanish in my youth; my name shall not be heard. Or it will be heard with grief; the tears of Nuäth must fall. Thou wilt be sad, son of Morni, for the departed fame of Oithona. But she shall sleep in the narrow tomb, far from the voice of the mourner. Why didst thou come, chief of Strumon, to the sea-beat rocks of Tromathon?” “I came to meet thy foes, daughter of car-borne Nuäth! the death of Cuthal's chief darkens before me; or Morni's son shall fall! Oithona! when Gaul is low, raise my tomb on that oozy rock. When the dark-bounding ship shall pass, call the sons of the sea! call them, and give this sword, to bear it hence to Morni's hall. The grey-haired chief will then cease to look towards the desert, for the return of his son!” “Shall the daughter of Nuäth live?” she replied with a bursting sigh, “Shall I live in Tromathon, and the son of Morni low? My heart is not of that rock; nor my soul careless as that sea; which lifts its blue waves to every wind, and rolls beneath the storm! The blast which shall lay thee low, shall spread the branches of Oithona on earth. We shall wither together, son of car-borne Morni! The narrow house is pleasant to me, and the grey stone of the dead. for never more will I leave thy rocks, O sea-surrounded Tromathon! Night came on with her clouds, after the departure of Lathmon, when he went to the wars of his fathers, to the moss-covered rock of Duthormoth. Night came on. I sat in the hall, at the beam of the oak! The wind was abroad in the trees. I heard the sound of arms. Joy rose in my face. I thought of thy return. It was the chief of Cuthal, the red-haired strength of Dunrommath. His eyes rolled in fire: the blood of my people was on his sword. They who defended Oithona fell by the gloomy chief! What could I do? My arm was weak. I could not lift the spear. He took me in my grief, amidst my tears he raised the sail. He feared the returning Lathmon, the brother of unhappy Oithona! But behold he comes with his people! the dark wave is divided before him! Whither wilt thou turn thy steps, son of Morni? Many are the warriors of thy foe!” “My steps never turned from battle,” Gaul said and unsheathed his sword. “Shall I then begin to fear, Oithona, when thy foes are near? Go to thy cave, my love, till our battle cease on the field. Son of Leth, bring the bows of our fathers! the sounding quiver of Morni! Let our three warriors bend the yew. Ourselves will lift the spear. They are an host on the rock! our souls are strong in war!” Oithona went to the cave. A troubled joy rose on her mind, like the red path of lightning on a stormy cloud! Her soul was resolved; the tear was dried from her wildly-looking eye. Dunrommath slowly approached. He saw the son of Morni. Contempt contracted his face, a smile is on his dark-brown cheek; his red eye rolled, half-concealed, beneath his shaggy brows! “Whence are the sons of the sea,” begun the gloomy chief? “Have the winds driven you on the rocks of Tromathon? Or come you in search of the white-handed maid? The sons of the unhappy, ye feeble men, come to the hand of Dunrommath! His eye spares not the weak; he delights in the blood of strangers. Oithona is a beam of light, and the chief of Cuthal enjoys it in secret; wouldst thou come on its loveliness, like a cloud, son of the feeble hand! Thou mayst come, but shalt thou return to the halls of thy fathers?” “Dost thou not know me,” said Gaul, “red-haired chief of Cuthal? Thy feet were swift on the heath, in the battle of car-borne Lathmon; when the sword of Morni's son pursued his host, in Morven's woody land. Dunrommath! thy words are mighty, for thy warriors gather behind thee. But do I fear them, son of pride? I am not of the race of the feeble!” Gaul advanced in his arms; Dunrommath shrunk behind his people. But the spear of Gaul pierced the gloomy chief; his sword lopped off his head, as it bended in death. The son of Morni shook it thrice by the lock; the warriors of Dunrommath fled. The arrows of Morven pursued them: ten fell on the mossy rocks. The rest lift the sounding sail, and bound on the troubled deep. Gaul advanced towards the cave of Oithona. He beheld a youth leaning on a rock. An arrow had pierced his side; his eye rolled faintly beneath his helmet. The soul of Morni's son was sad, he came and spoke the words of peace. “Can the hand of Gaul heal thee, youth of the mournful brow? I have searched for the herbs of the mountains; I have gathered them on the secret banks of their streams. My hand has closed the wound of the brave, their eyes have blessed the son of Morni. Where dwelt thy fathers, warrior? Were they of the sons of the mighty? Sadness shall come, like night, on thy native streams. Thou art fallen in thy youth!” “My fathers,” replied the stranger, “were of the race of the mighty; but they shall not be sad; for my fame is departed like morning mist. High walls rise on the banks of Duvranna; and see their mossy towers in the stream; a rock ascends behind them with its bending pines. Thou mayst behold it far distant. There my brother dwells. He is renowned in battle: give him this glittering helm.” The helmet fell from the hand of Gaul. It was the wounded Oithona! She had armed herself in the cave, and came in search of death. Her heavy eyes are half closed; the blood pours from her heaving side. “Son of Morni,” she said, “prepare the narrow tomb. Sleep grows, like darkness, on my soul. The eyes of Oithona are dim! O had I dwelt at Duvranna, in the bright beam of my fame! then had my years come on with joy; the virgins would then bless my steps. But I fall in youth, son of Morni; my father shall blush in his hall!” She fell pale on the rock of Tromathon. The mournful warrior raised her tomb. He came to Morven; we saw the darkness of his soul. Ossian took the harp in the praise of Oithona. The brightness of the face of Gaul returned. But his sigh rose, at times, in the midst of his friends; like blasts that shake their unfrequent wings, after the stormy winds are laid! CROMA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Malvina, the daughter of Toscar, is overheard by Ossian lamenting the death of Oscar her lover. Ossian, to divert her grief, relates his own actions in an expedition which he undertook, at Fingal's command, to aid Crothar, the petty king of Croma, a country in Ireland, against Rothmar, who invaded his dominions. The story is delivered down thus in tradition. Crothar, king of Croma, being blind with age, and his son too young for the field, Rothmar, the chief of Tromlo, resolved to avail himself of the opportunity offered of annexing the dominions of Crothar to his own. He accordingly marched into the country subject to Crothar, but which he held of Arth, or Artho, who was, at the time, supreme king of Ireland. Crothar being, on account of his age and blindness, unfit for action, sent for aid to Fingal, king of Scotland; who ordered his son Ossian to the relief of Crothar. But before his arrival, Fovargormo, the son of Crothar, attacking Rothmar, was slain himself, and his forces totally defeated. Ossian renewed the war; came to battle, killed Rothmar, and routed his army. Croma being thus delivered of its enemies, Ossian returned to Scotland. Macpherson. It was the voice of my love! “It was the voice of my love! seldom art thou in the dreams of Malvina! Open your airy halls, O fathers of Toscar of shields! Unfold the gates of your clouds: the steps of Malvina are near. I have heard a voice in my dream. I feel the fluttering of my soul. Why didst thou come, O blast, from the dark-rolling face of the lake? Thy rustling wing was in the tree; the dream of Malvina fled. But she beheld her love, when his robe of mist flew on the wind. A sun-beam was on his skirts, they glittered like the gold of the stranger. It was the voice of my love! seldom comes he to my dreams!” “But thou dwellest in the soul of Malvina, son of mighty Ossian! My sighs arise with the beam of the east; my tears descend with the drops of night. I was a lovely tree, in thy presence, Oscar, with all my branches round me; but thy death came like a blast from the desert, and laid my green head low. The spring returned with its showers; no leaf of mine arose! The virgins saw me silent in the hall; they touched the harp of joy. The tear was on the cheek of Malvina: the virgins beheld me in my grief. Why art thou sad, they said, thou first of the maids of Lutha? Was he lovely as the beam of the morning, and stately in thy sight?” Pleasant is thy song in Ossian's ear, daughter of streamy Lutha! Thou hast heard the music of departed bards, in the dream of thy rest, when sleep fell on thine eyes, at the murmur of Moruth. When thou didst return from the chace, in the day of the sun, thou hast heard the music of bards, and thy song is lovely! It is lovely, O Malvina, but it melts the soul. There is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the breast of the sad. But sorrow wastes the mournful, O daughter of Toscar, and their days are few! They fall away, like the flower on which the sun hath looked in his strength after the mildew has passed over it, when its head is heavy with the drops of night. Attend to the tale of Ossian, O maid. He remembers the days of his youth! The king commanded; I raised my sails, and rushed into the bay of Croma; into Croma's sounding bay in lovely Inisfail. High on the coast arose the towers of Crothar king of spears; Crothar renowned in the battles of his youth; but age dwelt then around the chief. Rothmar had raised the sword against the hero; and the wrath of Fingal burned. He sent Ossian to meet Rothmar in war, for the chief of Croma was the friénd of his youth. I sent the bard before me with songs. I came into the hall of Crothar. There sat the chief amidst the arms of his fathers, but his eyes had failed. His grey locks waved around a staff, on which the warrior leaned. He hummed the song of other times, when the sound of our arms reached his ears. Crothar rose, stretched his aged hand and blessed the son of Fingal. “Ossian!” said the hero, “the strength of Crothar's arm has failed. O could I lift the sword, as on the day that Fingal fought at Strutha! He was the first of men! but Crothar had also his fame. The king of Morven praised me; he placed on my arm the bossy shield of Calthar, whom the king had slain in his wars. Dost thou not behold it on the wall, for Crothar's eyes have failed? Is thy strength, like thy father's, Ossian? let the aged feel thine arm!” I gave my arm to the king; he felt it with his aged hands. The sigh rose in his breast, and his tears came down. “Thou art strong, my son,” he said, “but not like the king of Morven! But who is like the hero among the mighty in war! Let the feast of my hall be spread; and let my bards exalt the song. Great is he that is within my walls, ye sons of echoing Croma!” The feast is spread. The harp is heard; and joy is in the hall. But it was joy covering a sigh, that darkly dwelt in every breast. It was like a faint beam of the moon spread on a cloud in heaven. At length the music ceased, and the aged king of Croma spoke; he spoke without a tear, but sorrow swelled in the midst of his voice. “Son of Fingal! beholdest thou not the darkness of Crothar's joy? My soul was not sad at the feast, when the people lived before me. I rejoiced in the presence of strangers, when my son shone in the hall. But, Ossian, he is a beam that is departed. He left no streak of light behind. He is fallen, son of Fingal, in the wars of his father. Rothmar, the chief of grassy Tromlo, heard that these eyes had failed; he heard that my arms were fixed in the hall, and the pride of his soul arose! He came towards Croma; my people fell before him. I took my arms in my wrath, but what could sightless Crothar do? My steps were unequal; my grief was great. I wished for the days that were past. Days wherein I fought; and won in the field of blood. My son returned from the chace; the fair-haired Fovar-gormo. He had not lifted his sword in battle, for his arm was young. But the soul of the youth was great; the fire of valour burnt in his eyes. He saw the disordered steps of his father, and his sighs arose. “King of Croma,” he said, “is it because thou hast no son; is it for the weakness of Fovar-gormo's arm that thy sighs arise? I begin, my father, to feel my strength; I have drawn the sword of my youth; and I have bent the bow. Let me meet this Rothmar, with the sons of Croma: let me meet him, O my father; I feel my burning soul!” And thou shalt meet him, I said, son of the sightless Crothar! But let others advance before thee, that I may hear the tread of thy feet at thy return; for my eyes behold thee not, fair-haired Fovar-gormo! He went, he met the foe; he fell. Rothmar advances to Croma. He who slew my son is near, with all his pointed spears.” This is no time to fill the shell, I replied, and took my spear! My people saw the fire of my eyes; they all arose around. Through night we strode along the heath. Grey morning rose in the east. A green narrow vale appeared before us; nor wanting was its winding stream. The dark host of Rothmar are on its banks, with all their glittering arms. We fought along the vale. They fled. Rothmar sunk beneath my sword! Day had not descended in the west, when I brought his arms to Crothar. The aged hero felt them with his hands; and joy brightened over all his thoughts. The people gather to the hall. The shells of the feast are heard. Ten harps are strung; five bards advance, and sing, by turns, the praise of Ossian; they poured forth their burning souls, and the string answered to their voice. The joy of Croma was great: for peace returned to the land. The night came on with silence; the morning returned with joy. No foe came in darkness, with his glittering spear. The joy of Croma was great; for the gloomy Rothmar had fallen! I raised my voice for Fovar-gormo, when they laid the chief in earth. The aged Crothar was there, but his sigh was not heard. He searched for the wound of his son, and found it in his breast. Joy rose in the face of the aged. He came and spoke to Ossian. “King of spears!” he said, “my son has not fallen without his fame. The young warrior did not fly; but met death, as he went forward in his strength. Happy are they who die in youth, when their renown is heard! The feeble will not behold them in the hall; or smile at their trembling hands. Their memory shall be honoured in song; the young tear of the virgin will fall. But the aged wither away, by degrees; the fame of their youth, while they yet live, is all forgot. They fall in secret. The sigh of their son is not heard. Joy is around their tomb; the stone of their fame is placed without a tear. Happy are they who die in youth, when their renown is around them. BERRATHON: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin, whither he had been invited by Starno, the father of Agandecca, touched at Berrathon, an island of Scandinavia, where he was kindly entertained by Larthmor, the petty king of the place, who was a vassal of the supreme kings of Lochlin. The hospitality of Larthmor gained him Fingal's friendship, which that hero manifested, after the imprisonment of Larthmor by his own son, by sending Ossian and Toscar, the father of Malvina, so often mentioned, to rescue Larthmor, and to punish the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was handsome, and, by the ladies, much admired. Nina-thoma, the beautiful daughter of Torthoma, a neighbouring prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved inconstant; for another lady, whose name is not mentioned, gaining his affections, he confined Nina-thoma to a desert island near the coast of Berrathon. She was relieved by Ossian, who, in company with Toscar, landing on Berrathon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a single combat. Nina-thoma, whose love not all the bad behaviour of Uthal could erase, hearing of his death, died of grief. In the mean time Larthmor is restored, and Ossian and Toscar return in triumph to Fingal. The poem opens with an elegy on the death of Malvina the daughter of Toscar, and closes with presages of Ossian's death. Macpherson. Bend thy blue course, O stream Bend thy blue course, O stream, round the narrow plain of Lutha. Let the green woods hang over it, from their hills. the sun look on it at noon. The thistle is there on its rock, and shakes its beard to the wind. The flower hangs its heavy head, waving, at times, to the gale. “Why dost thou awake me, O gale,” it seems to say, “I am covered with the drops of heaven? The time of my fading is near, the blast that shall scatter my leaves. To-morrow shall the traveller come; he that saw me in my beauty shall come. His eyes will search the field, but they will not find me?” So shall they search in vain, for the voice of Cona, after it has failed in the field. The hunter shall come forth in the morning, and the voice of my harp shall not be heard. “Where is the son of car-borne Fingal?” The tear will be on his cheek! Then come thou, O Malvina, with all thy music, come. Lay Ossian in the plain of Lutha: let his tomb rise in the lovely field. Malvina! where art thou, with thy songs, with the soft sound of thy steps? Son of Alpin, art thou near? where is the daughter of Toscar? “I passed, O son of Fingal, by Tor-lutha's mossy walls. The smoke of the hall was ceased. Silence was among the trees of the hill. The voice of the chace was over. I saw the daughters of the bow. I asked about Malvina, but they answered not. They turned their faces away: thin darkness covered their beauty. They were like stars, on a rainy hill, by night, each looking faintly through the mist.” Pleasant be thy rest, O lovely beam! soon hast thou set on our hills! The steps of thy departure were stately, like the moon on the blue, trembling wave. But thou hast left us in darkness, first of the maids of Lutha! We sit, at the rock, and there is no voice; no light but the meteor of fire! Soon hast thou set, O Malvina, daughter of generous Toscar! But thou risest like the beam of the east, among the spirits of thy friends, where they sit, in their stormy halls, the chambers of the thunder! A cloud hovers over Cona. Its blue curling sides are high. The winds are beneath it, with their wings. Within it is the dwelling of Fingal. There the hero sits in darkness. His airy spear is in his hand. His shield half covered with clouds, is like the darkened moon; when one half still remains in the wave, and the other looks sickly on the field! His friends sit around the king, on mist! They hear the songs of Ullin: he strikes the half-viewless harp. He raises the feeble voice. The lesser heroes, with a thousand meteors, light the airy hall. Malvina rises, in the midst; a blush is on her cheek. She beholds the unknown faces of her fathers. She turns aside her humid eyes. “Art thou come so soon?” said Fingal, “daughter of generous Toscar. Sadness dwells in the halls of Lutha. My aged son is sad! I hear the breeze of Cona, that was wont to lift thy heavy locks. It comes to the hall, but thou art not there. Its voice is mournful among the arms of thy fathers! Go, with thy rustling wing, O breeze! sigh on Malvina's tomb. It rises yonder beneath the rock, at the blue stream of Lutha. The maids are departed to their place. Thou alone, O breeze, mournest there!” But who comes from the dusky west, supported on a cloud? A smile is on his grey, watry face. His locks of mist fly on wind. He bends forward on his airy spear. It is thy father, Malvina! “Why shinest thou, so soon, on our clouds,” he says, “O lovely light of Lutha! But thou wert sad, my daughter. Thy friends had passed away. The sons of little men were in the hall. None remained of the heroes, but Ossian, king of spears!” And dost thou remember Ossian, car-borne Toscar, son of Conloch? The battles of our youth were many. Our swords went together to the field. They saw us coming like two falling rocks. The sons of the stranger fled. “There come the warriors of Cona!” they said. “Their steps are in the paths of the flying!” Draw near, son of Alpin, to the song of the aged. The deeds of other times are in my soul. My memory beams on the days that are past. On the days of mighty Toscar, when our path was in the deep. Draw near, son of Alpin, to the last sound of the voice of Cona! The king of Morven commanded. I raised my sails to the wind. Toscar chief of Lutha stood at my side, I rose on the dark-blue wave. Our course was to sea-surrounded Berrathon, the isle of many storms. There dwelt, with his locks of age, the stately strength of Larthmor. Larthmor, who spread the feast of shells to Fingal, when he went to Starno's halls, in the days of Agandecca. But when the chief was old, the pride of his son arose; the pride of fair-haired Uthal, the love of a thousand maids. He bound the aged Larthmor, and dwelt in his sounding halls! Long pined the king in his cave, beside his rolling sea. Day did not come to his dwelling; nor the burning oak by night. But the wind of ocean was there, and the parting beam of the moon. The red star looked on the king, when it trembled on the western wave. Snitho came to Selma's hall: Snitho the friend of Larthmor's youth. He told of the king of Berrathon: the wrath of Fingal arose. Thrice he assumed the spear, resolved to stretch his hand to Uthal. But the memory of his deeds rose before the king. He sent his son and Toscar. Our joy was great on the rolling sea. We often half-unsheathed our swords. For never before had we fought alone, on the battles of the spear. Night came down on the ocean. The winds departed on their wings. Cold and pale is the moon. The red stars lift their heads on high. Our course is slow along the coast of Berrathon. The white waves tumble on the rocks. “What voice is that,” said Toscar, “which comes between the sounds of the waves? It is soft but mournful, like the voice of departed bards. But I behold a maid. She sits on the rock alone. Her head bends on her arm of snow. Her dark hair is in the wind. Hear, son of Fingal, her song, it is smooth as the gliding stream. We came to the silent bay, and heard the maid of night. “How long will ye roll around me, blue-tumbling waters of ocean? My dwelling was not always in caves, nor beneath the whistling tree. The feast was spread in Torthóma's hall. My father delighted in my voice. The youths beheld me in the steps of my loveliness. They blessed the dark-haired Nina-thoma. It was then thou didst come, O Uthal! like the sun of heaven! the souls of the virgins are thine, son of generous Larthmor! But why dost thou leave me alone, in the midst of roaring waters? Was my soul dark with thy death? Did my white hand lift the sword? Why then hast thou left me alone, king of high Finthormo!” The tear started from my eye, when I heard the voice of the maid. I stood before her in my arms. I spoke the words of peace! “Lovely dweller of the cave! what sigh is in thy breast? Shall Ossian lift his sword in thy presence, the destruction of thy foes? Daughter of Torthóma, rise. I have heard the words of thy grief. The race of Morven are around thee, who never injured the weak. Come to our dark-bosomed ship! thou brighter than that setting moon! Our course is to the rocky Berrathon, to the echoing walls of Finthormo.” She came in her beauty; she came with all her lovely steps. Silent joy brightened in her face; as when the shadows fly from the field of spring; the blue stream is rolling in brightness, and the green bush bends over its course! The morning rose with its beams. We came to Rothma's bay. A boar rushed from the wood: my spear pierced his side, and he fell. I rejoiced over the blood. I foresaw my growing fame. But now the sound of Uthal's train came, from the high Finthormo. They spread over the heath to the chace of the boar. Himself comes slowly on, in the pride of his strength. He lifts two pointed spears. On his side is the hero's sword. Three youths carry his polished bows. The bounding of five dogs is before him. His heroes move on, at a distance, admiring the steps of the king. Stately was the son of Larthmor! but his soul was dark! Dark as the troubled face of the moon, when it foretells the storms! We rose on the heath before the king. He stopt in the midst of his course. His heroes gathered around. A grey-haired bard advanced. “Whence are the sons of the strangers!” began the bard of song. “The children of the unhappy come to Berrathon; to the sword of car-borne Uthal. He spreads no feast in his hall. The blood of strangers is on his streams. If from Selma's walls ye come, from the mossy walls of Fingal, chuse three youths to go to your king to tell of the fall of his people. Perhaps the hero may come and pour his blood on Uthal's sword. So shall the fame of Finthormo arise, like the growing tree of the vale!” “Never will it rise, O bard,” I said in the pride of my wrath. “He would shrink from the presence of Fingal, whose eyes are the flames of death. The son of Comhal comes, and kings vanish before him. They are rolled together, like mist, by the breath of his rage. Shall three tell to Fingal, that his people fell? Yes! they may tell it, bard! but his people shall fall with fame!” I stood in the darkness of my strength. Toscar drew his sword at my side. The foe came on like a stream. The mingled sound of death arose. Man took man, shield met shield; steel mixed its beams with steel. Darts hiss through air. Spears ring on mails. Swords on broken bucklers bound. As the noise of an aged grove beneath the roaring wind, when a thousand ghosts break the trees by night, such was the din of arms. But Uthal fell beneath my sword. The sons of Berrathon fled. It was then I saw him in his beauty, and the tear hung in my eye! “Thou art fallen, young tree,” I said, “with all thy beauty round thee. Thou art fallen on thy plains, and the field is bare. The winds come from the desert! there is no sound in thy leaves! Lovely art thou in death, son of car-borne Larthmon.” Nina-thoma sat on the shore. She heard the sound of battle. She turned her red eyes on Lethmal, the grey-haired bard of Selma. He alone had remained on the coast, with the daughter of Torthóma. “Son of the times of old!” she said, “I hear the noise of death. Thy friends have met with Uthal, and the chief is low! O that I had remained on the rock, inclosed with the tumbling waves! Then would my soul be sad, but his death would not reach my ear. Art thou fallen on thy heath, O son of high Finthormo? Thou didst leave me on a rock, but my soul was full of thee. Son of high Finthormo! art thou fallen on thy heath?” She rose pale in her tears. She saw the bloody shield of Uthal. She saw it in Ossian's hand. Her steps were distracted on the heath. She flew. She found him. She fell. Her soul came forth in a sigh. Her hair is spread on her face. My bursting tears descend. A tomb arose on the unhappy. My song of woe was heard. “Rest, hapless children of youth! Rest at the noise of that mossy stream! The virgins will see your tomb, at the chace, and turn away their weeping eyes. Your fame will be in song. The voice of the harp will be heard in your praise. The daughters of Selma shall hear it: your renown shall be in other lands. Rest, children of youth, at the noise of the mossy stream!” Two days we remained on the coast. The heroes of Berrathon convened. We brought Larthmor to his halls. The feast of shells is spread. The joy of the aged was great. He looked to the arms of his fathers. The arms which he left in his hall, when the pride of Uthal rose. We were renowned before Larthmor. He blessed the chiefs of Morven. He knew not that his son was low, the stately strength of Uthal! They had told, that he had retired to the woods, with the tears of grief. They had told it, but he was silent in the tomb of Rothma's heath. On the fourth day we raised our sails, to the roar of the northern wind. Larthmor came to the coast. His bards exalted the song. The joy of the king was great, he looked to Rothma's gloomy heath. He saw the tomb of his son. The memory of Uthal rose. “Who of my heroes,” he said, “lies there? he seems to have been of the kings of men. Was he renowned in my halls, before the pride of Uthal rose? Ye are silent, sons of Berrathon! is the king of heroes low? My heart melts for thee, O Uthal! though thy hand was against thy father. O that I had remained in the cave! that my son had dwelt in Finthormo! I might have heard the tread of his feet when he went to the chace of the boar. I might have heard his voice on the blast of my cave. Then would my soul be glad: but now darkness dwells in my halls.” Such were my deeds; son of Alpin, when the arm of my youth was strong. Such the actions of Toscar, the car-borne son of Conloch. But Toscar is on his flying cloud. I am alone at Lutha. My voice is like the last sound of the wind, when it forsakes the woods. But Ossian shall not be long alone. He sees the mist that shall receive his ghost. He beholds the mist that shall form his robe, when he appears on his hills. The sons of feeble men shall behold me, and admire the stature of the chiefs of old. They shall creep to their caves. They shall look to the sky with fear: for my steps shall be in the clouds. Darkness shall roll on my side. Lead, son of Alpin, lead the aged to his woods. The winds begin to rise. The dark wave of the lake resounds. Bends there not a tree from Mora with its branches bare? It bends, son of Alpin, in the rustling blast. My harp hangs on a blasted branch. The sound of its strings is mournful. Does the wind touch thee, O harp, or is it some passing ghost! It is the hand of Malvina! Bring me the harp, son of Alpin. Another song shall rise. My soul shall depart in the sound. My fathers shall hear it in their airy hall. Their dim faces shall hang, with joy, from their clouds; and their hands receive their son. The aged oak bends over the stream. It sighs with all its moss. The withered fern whistles near, and mixes, as it waves, with Ossian's hair. “Strike the harp, and raise the song: be near, with all your wings, ye winds. Bear the mournful sound away to Fingal's airy hall. Bear it to Fingal's hall, that he may hear the voice of his son. The voice of him that praised the mighty!” “The blast of north opens thy gates, O king. I behold thee sitting on mist, dimly gleaming in all thine arms. Thy form now is not the terror of the valiant. It is like a watery cloud; when we see the stars behind it, with their weeping eyes. Thy shield is the aged moon; thy sword a vapour half-kindled with fire. Dim and feeble is the chief, who travelled in brightness before! But thy steps are on the winds of the desert. The storms are darkening in thy hand. Thou takest the sun in thy wrath, and hidest him in thy clouds. The sons of little men are afraid. A thousand showers descend. But when thou comest forth in thy mildness, the gale of the morning is near thy course. The sun laughs in his blue fields. The grey stream winds in its vale. The bushes shake their green heads in the wind. The roes bound towards the desert.” “There is a murmur in the heath! the stormy winds abate! I hear the voice of Fingal. Long has it been absent from mine ear! “Come, Ossian, come away,” he says. “Fingal has received his fame. We passed away, like flames that had shone for a season. Our departure was in renown. Though the plains of our battles are dark and silent; our fame is in the four grey stones. The voice of Ossian has been heard. The harp has been strung in Selma. “Come, Ossian, come away,” he says, “come, fly with thy fathers on clouds.” I come, I come, thou king of men! The life of Ossian fails. I begin to vanish on Cona. My steps are not seen in Selma. Beside the stone of Mora I shall fall asleep. The winds whistling in my grey hair, shall not awaken me. Depart on thy wings, O wind: thou canst not disturb the rest of the bard. The night is long, but his eyes are heavy. Depart, thou rustling blast.” “But why art thou sad, son of Fingal? Why grows the cloud of thy soul? The chiefs of other times are departed. They have gone without their fame. The sons of future years shall pass away. Another race shall arise. The people are like the waves of ocean: like the leaves of woody Morven, they pass away in the rustling blast, and other leaves lift their green heads on high.” Did thy beauty last, O Ryno! Stood the strength of car-borne Oscar? Fingal himself departed. The halls of his fathers forgot his steps. Shalt thou then remain, thou aged bard! when the mighty have failed? But my fame shall remain, and grow like the oak of Morven; which lifts its broad head to the storm, and rejoices in the course of the wind! END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM. Vultis et his mecum paritur considere regnis, Urbem quam statuo, vestra est. Virgil. BOOK I. ARGUMENT. Cairbar, the son of Borbar-duthal, lord of Atha in Connaught, the most potent chief of the race of Firbolg, having murdered, at Temora the royal palace, Cormac the son of Artho, the young king of Ireland, usurped the throne. Cormac was lineally descended from Conar the son of Trenmor, the great grandfather of Fingal, king of those Caledonians who inhabited the western coast of Scotland. Fingal resented the behaviour of Cairbar, and resolved to pass over into Ireland, with an army, to re-establish the royal family on the Irish throne. Early intelligence of his designs coming to Cairbar, he assembled some of his tribes in Ulster, and at the same time ordered his brother Cathmor to follow him speedily with an army, from Temora. Such was the situation of affairs when the Caledonian invaders appeared on the coast of Ulster. The poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is represented as retired from the rest of the army, when one of his scouts brought him news of the landing of Fingal. He assembles a council of his chiefs. Foldath the chief of Moma haughtily despises the enemy; and is reprimanded warmly by Malthos. Cairbar, after hearing their debate, orders a feast to be prepared, to which, by his bard Olla, he invites Oscar the son of Ossian; resolving to pick a quarrel with that hero, and so have some pretext for killing him. Oscar came to the feast; the quarrel happened; the followers of both fought, and Cairbar and Oscar fell by mutual wounds. The noise of the battle reached Fingal's army. The king came on, to the relief of Oscar, and the Irish fell back to the army of Cathmor, who was advanced to the banks of the river Lubar, on the heath of Moilena. Fingal, after mourning over his grandson, ordered Ullin the chief of his bards to carry his body to Morven, to be there interred. Night coming on, Althan, the son of Conachar, relates to the king the particulars of the murder of Cormac. Fillan, the son of Fingal, is sent to observe the motions of Cathmor by night, which concludes the action of the first day. The scene of this book is a plain, near the hill of Mora, which rose on the borders of the heath of Moilena, in Ulster. Macpherson. The blue waves of Erin roll in light. The blue waves of Erin roll in light. The mountains are covered with day. Trees shake their dusky heads in the breeze. Grey torrents pour their noisy streams. Two green hills, with aged oaks, surround a narrow plain. The blue course of a stream is there. On its banks stood Cairbar of Atha. His spear supports the king: the red eye of his fear is sad. Cormac rises in his soul, with all his ghastly wounds. The grey form of the youth appears in darkness. Blood pours from his airy sides. Cairbar thrice threw his spear on earth. Thrice he stroked his beard. His steps are short. He often stops. He tosses his sinewy arms. He is like a cloud in the desert, varying its form to every blast. The valleys are sad around, and fear, by turns, the shower! The king, at length, resumed his soul. He took his pointed spear. He turned his eye to Moi-lena. The scouts of blue ocean came. They came with steps of fear, and often looked behind. Cairbar knew that the mighty were near! He called his gloomy chiefs. The sounding steps of his warriors came. They drew, at once, their swords. There Morlath stood with darkened face. Hidalla's long hair sighs in wind. Red-haired Cormar bends on his spear, and rolls his side-long-looking eyes. Wild is the look of Malthos from beneath two shaggy brows. Foldath stands, like an oozy rock, that covers its dark sides with foam. His spear is like Slimora's fir, that meets the wind of heaven. His shield is marked with the strokes of battle. His red eye despises danger. These, and a thousand other chiefs, surrounded the king of Erin, when the scout of ocean came, Mor-annal, from streamy Moi-lena. His eyes hang forward from his face. His lips are trembling, pale! “Do the chiefs of Erin stand,” he said, “silent as the grove of evening? Stand they, like a silent wood, and Fingal on the coast? Fingal, who is terrible in battle, the king of streamy Morven?” “Hast thou seen the warrior?” said Cairbar, with a sigh. “Are his heroes many on the coast? Lifts he the spear of battle? Or comes the king in peace?” In peace he comes not, king of Erin. I have seen his forward spear. It is a meteor of death. The blood of thousands is on its steel. He came first to the shore, strong in the grey-hair of age. Full rose his sinewy limbs, as he strode in his might. That sword is by his side, which gives no second wound. His shield is terrible, like the bloody moon, ascending through a storm. Then came Ossian, king of songs. Then Morni's son, the first of men. Connal leaps forward on his spear. Dermid spreads his dark-brown locks. Fillan bends his bow, the young hunter of streamy Moruth. But who is that before them, like the terrible course of a stream! It is the son of Ossian, bright between his locks! His long hair falls on his back. His dark brows are half-inclosed in steel. His sword hangs loose on his side. His spear glitters as he moves. I fled from his terrible eyes, king of high Temora!” “Then fly, thou feeble man,” said Foldath's gloomy wrath. “Fly to the grey streams of thy land, son of the little soul! Have not I seen that Oscar? I beheld the chief in war. He is of the mighty in danger: but there are others who lift the spear. Erin has many sons as brave, king of Temora of groves! Let Foldath meet him in his strength. Let me stop this mighty stream. My spear is covered with blood. My shield is like the wall of Tura!” “Shall Foldath alone meet the foe?” replied the dark-browed Malthos. “Are they not numerous on our coast, like the waters of many streams? Are not these the chiefs, who vanquished Swaran, when the sons of green Erin fled? Shall Foldath meet their bravest hero? Foldath of the heart of pride! take the strength of the people! and let Malthos come. My sword is red with slaughter; but who has heard my words!” “Sons of green Erin,” said Hidalla, “let not Fingal hear your words. The foe might rejoice, and his arm be strong in the land. Ye are brave, O warriors! Ye are tempests in war. Ye are, like storms, which meet the rocks without fear, and overturn the woods. But let us move in our strength, slow as a gathered cloud! Then shall the mighty tremble; the spear shall fall from the hand of the valiant. We see the cloud of death, they will say, while shadows fly over their face. Fingal will mourn in his age. He shall behold his flying fame. The steps of his chiefs will cease in Morven. The moss of years shall grow in Selma.” Cairbar heard their words, in silence, like the cloud of a shower: it stands dark on Cromla, till the lightning bursts its side. The valley gleams with heaven's flame; the spirits of the storm rejoice. So stood the silent king of Temora; at length his words broke forth. “Spread the feast on Moi-lena. Let my hundred bards attend. Thou, red-haired Olla, take the harp of the king. Go to Oscar, chief of swords. Bid Oscar to our joy. To-day we feast and hear the song; to-morrow break the spears! Tell him that I have raised the tomb of Cathol; that bards gave his friend to the winds. Tell him, that Cairbar has heard of his fame at the stream of resounding Carun. Cathmor, my brother, is not here. He is not here with his thousands, and our arms are weak. Cathmor is a foe to strife at the feast! His soul is bright as that sun! But Cairbar must fight with Oscar, chiefs of woody Temora! His words for Cathol were many; the wrath of Cairbar burns. He shall fall on Moi-lena. My fame shall rise in blood.” Their faces brightened round with joy. They spread over Moi-lena. The feast of shells is prepared. The songs of bards arise. The chiefs of Selma heard their joy. We thought that mighty Cathmor came. Cathmor, the friend of strangers! the brother of red-haired Cairbar. Their souls were not the same. The light of heaven was in the bosom of Cathmor. His towers rose on the banks of Atha: seven paths led to his halls. Seven chiefs stood on the paths, and called the stranger to the feast! But Cathmor dwelt in the wood, to shun the voice of praise! Olla came with his songs. Oscar went to Cairbar's feast. Three hundred warriors strode, along Moi-lena of the streams. The grey dogs bounded on the heath: Their howling reached afar. Fingal saw the departing hero. The soul of the king was sad. He dreaded Cairbar's gloomy thoughts, amidst the feast of shells. My son raised high the spear of Cormac. An hundred bards met him with songs. Cairbar concealed with smiles, the death that was dark in his soul. The feast is spread. The shells resound. Joy brightens the face of the host. But it was like the parting beam of the sun, when he is to hide his red head in a storm. Cairbar rises in his arms. Darkness gathers on his brow. The hundred harps cease at once. The clang of shields is heard. Far distant on the heath Olla raised a song of woe. My son knew the sign of death; and rising, seized his spear. “Oscar,” said the dark-red Cairbar, “I behold the spear of Erin. The spear of Temora glitters in thy hand, son of woody Morven! It was the pride of an hundred kings. The death of heroes of old. Yield it, son of Ossian, yield it to carborne Cairbar!” “Shall I yield,” Oscar replied, “the gift of Erin's injured king; the gift of fair-haired Cormac, when Oscar scattered his foes? I came to Cormac's halls with joy, when Swaran fled from Fingal. Gladness rose in the face of youth. He gave the spear of Temora. Nor did he give it to the feeble: neither to the weak in soul. The darkness of thy face is no storm to me; nor are thine eyes the flame of death. Do I fear thy clanging shield? Tremble I at Olla's song? No: Cairbar, frighten the feeble: Oscar is a rock!” “Wilt thou not yield the spear?” replied the rising pride of Cairbar; “Are thy words so mighty, because Fingal is near? Fingal with aged locks, from Morven's hundred groves! He has fought with little men. But he must vanish before Cairbar, like a thin pillar of mist before the winds of Atha!” “Were he who fought with little men, near Atha's haughty chief: Atha's chief would yield green Erin to avoid his rage! Speak not of the mighty, O Cairbar! Turn thy sword on me. Our strength is equal: but Fingal is renowned! the first of mortal men!” Their people saw the darkening chiefs. Their crowding steps are heard around. Their eyes roll in fire. A thousand swords are half-unsheathed. Red-haired Olla raised the song of battle. The trembling joy of Oscar's soul arose: the wonted joy of his soul, when Fingal's horn was heard. Dark as the swelling wave of ocean before the rising winds, when it bends its head near the coast, came on the host of Cairbar! Daughter of Toscar! why that tear? He is not fallen yet. Many were the deaths of his arm before my hero fell! Behold they fall before my son, like groves in the desert; when an angry ghost rushes through night, and takes their green heads in his hand! Morlath falls. Maronnan dies. Conachar trembles in his blood! Cairbar shrinks before Oscar's sword! He creeps in darkness behind a stone. He lifts the spear in secret; he pierces my Oscar's side! He falls forward on his shield: his knee sustains the chief. But still his spear is in his hand. See, gloomy Cairbar falls! The steel pierced his forehead, and divided his red-hair behind. He lay, like a shattered rock, which Cromla shakes from its shaggy side, when the green-vallied Erin shakes its mountains, from sea to sea! But never more shall Oscar rise! He leans on his bossy shield. His spear is in his terrible hand. Erin's sons stand distant and dark. Their shouts arise, like crowded streams. Moi-lena echoes wide. Fingal heard the sound. He took the spear of Selma. His steps are before us on the heath. He spoke the words of woe. “I hear the noise of war. Young Oscar is alone. Rise, sons of Morven; join the hero's sword!” Ossian rushed along the heath. Fillan bounded over Moi-lena. Fingal strode in his strength. The light of his shield is terrible. The sons of Erin saw it far distant. They trembled in their souls. They knew that the wrath of the king arose; and they foresaw their death. We first arrived. We fought. Erin's chiefs withstood our rage. But when the king came, in the sound of his course, what heart of steel could stand! Erin fled over Moi-lena. Death pursued their flight. We saw Oscar on his shield. We saw the blood around. Silence darkened every face. Each turned his back and wept. The king strove to hide his tears. His grey beard whistled in the wind. He bends his head above the chief. His words are mixed with sighs. “Art thou fallen, O Oscar, in the midst of thy course? the heart of the aged beats over thee! He sees thy coming wars! The wars which ought to come he sees! They are cut off from thy fame! When shall joy dwell at Selma? When shall grief depart from Morven? My sons fall by degrees: Fingal is the last of his race. My fame begins to pass away. Mine age will be without friends. I shall sit a grey cloud in my hall. I shall not hear the return of a son, in his sounding arms. Weep, ye heroes of Morven! never more shall Oscar rise!” And they did weep, O Fingal! Dear was the hero to their souls. He went out to battle, and the foes vanished. He returned, in peace, amidst their joy. No father mourned his son slain in youth: no brother his brother of love. They fell, without tears; for the chief of the people is low! Bran is howling at his feet: gloomy Luäth is sad, for he had often led them to the chace; to the bounding roe of the desert! When Oscar saw his friends around, his heaving breast arose. “The groans,” he said, “of aged chiefs: The howling of my dogs: The sudden bursts of the song of grief, have melted Oscar's soul. My soul, that never melted before. It was like the steel of my sword. Ossian, carry me to my hills! Raise the stones of my renown. Place the horn of a deer; place my sword by my side. The torrent hereafter may raise the earth: the hunter may find the steel, and say, “This has been Oscar's sword, the pride of other years!” Fallest thou, son of my fame! Shall I never see thee, Oscar! When others hear of their sons, shall I not hear of thee? The moss is on thy four grey stones. The mournful wind is there. The battle shall be fought without thee. Thou shalt not pursue the dark-brown hinds. When the warrior returns from battles, and tells of other lands; “I have seen a tomb,” he will say, “by the roaring stream, the dark dwelling of a chief. He fell by car-borne Oscar, the first of mortal men.” I, perhaps, shall hear his voice. A beam of joy will rise in my soul.” Night would have descended in sorrow, and morning returned in the shadow of grief. Our chiefs would have stood, like cold dropping rocks on Moi-lena, and have forgot the war; did not the king disperse his grief, and raise his mighty voice. The chiefs, as new-waked from dreams, lift up their heads around. “How long on Moi-lena shall we weep? How long pour in Erin our tears? The mighty will not return. Oscar shall not rise in his strength. The valiant must fall in their day, and be no more known on their hills. Where are our fathers, O warriors! the chiefs of the times of old? They have set like stars that have shone. We only hear the sound of their praise. But they were renowned in their years; the terror of other times. Thus shall we pass away; in the day of our fall. Then let us be renowned when we may; and leave our fame behind us, like the last beams of the sun, when he hides his red head in the west. The traveller mourns his absence, thinking of the flame of his beams. Ullin, my aged bard! take thou the ship of the king. Carry Oscar to Selma of harps. Let the daughters of Morven weep. We must fight in Erin, for the race of fallen Cormac. The days of my years begin to fail. I feel the weakness of my arm. My fathers bend from their clouds, to receive their grey-haired son. But before I go hence, one beam of fame shall rise. My days shall end, as my years begun, in fame. My life shall be one stream of light to bards of other times!” Ullin raised his white sails. The wind of the south came forth. He bounded on the waves toward Selma. I remained in my grief, but my words were not heard. The feast is spread on Moi-lena. An hundred heroes reared the tomb of Cairbar. No song is raised over the chief. His soul had been dark and bloody. The bards remembered the fall of Cormac! what could they say in Cairbar's praise? Night came rolling down. The light of an hundred oaks arose. Fingal sat beneath a tree. Old Althan stood in the midst. He told the tale of fallen Cormac. Althan, the son of Conachar, the friend of car-borne Cuthullin. He dwelt with Cormac in windy Temora, when Semo's son fell at Lego's stream. The tale of Althan was mournful. The tear was in his eye when he spoke. “The setting sun was yellow on Dora. Grey evening began to descend. Temora's woods shook with the blast of the inconstant wind. A cloud gathered in the west. A red star looked from behind its edge. I stood in the wood alone. I saw a ghost on the darkening air! His stride extended from hill to hill. His shield was dim on his side. It was the son of Semo. I knew the warrior's face. But he passed away in his blast; and all was dark around! My soul was sad. I went to the hall of shells. A thousand lights arose. The hundred bards had strung the harp. Cormac stood in the midst, like the morning star, when it rejoices on the eastern hill, and its young beams are bathed in showers. Bright and silent is its progress aloft, but the cloud, that shall hide it, is near! The sword of Artho was in the hand of the king. He looked with joy on its polished studs: thrice he attempted to draw it, and thrice he failed; his yellow locks are spread on his shoulders: his cheeks of youth are red. I mourned over the beam of youth, for he was soon to set!” “Althan!” he said, with a smile, “didst thou behold my father? Heavy is the sword of the king; surely his arm was strong. O that I were like him in battle, when the rage of his wrath arose! then would I have met, with Cuthullin, the car-borne son of Cantéla! But years may come on, O Althan! and my arm be strong. Hast thou heard of Semo's son, the ruler of high Temora? He might have returned with his fame. He promised to return to-night. My bards wait him with songs. My feast is spread in the hall of kings.” I heard Cormac in silence. My tears began to flow. I hid them with my aged locks. The king perceived my grief. “Son of Conachar!” he said, “is the son of Semo low? Why bursts the sigh in secret! Why descends the tear? Comes the car-borne Torlath? Comes the sound of red-haired Cairbar? They come! for I behold thy grief. Mossy Tura's chief is low! Shall I not rush to battle? But I cannot lift the spear! O had mine arm the strength of Cuthullin, soon would Cairbar fly; the fame of my fathers would be renewed; and the deeds of other times!” He took his bow. The tears flow down from both his sparkling eyes. Grief saddens round. The bards bend forward from their hundred harps. The lone blast touched their trembling strings. The sound is sad and low! A voice is heard at a distance, as of one in grief. It was Carril, of other times, who came from dark Slimora. He told of the fall of Cuthullin. He told of his mighty deeds. The people were scattered round his tomb. Their arms lay on the ground. They had forgot the war; for he, their sire, was seen no more! “But who,” said the soft-voiced Carril, “who come like bounding roes? Their stature is like young trees in the valley, growing in a shower! Soft and ruddy are their cheeks! Fearless souls look forth from their eyes! Who but the sons of Usnoth, chief of streamy Etha? The people rise on every side, like the strength of an half-extinguished fire, when the winds come sudden from the desert, on their rustling wings. Sudden glows the dark brow of the hill; the passing mariner lags, on his winds. The sound of Caithbat's shield was heard. The warriors saw Cuthullin in Nathos. So rolled his sparkling eyes! his steps were such on heath! Battles are fought at Lego. The sword of Nathos prevails. Soon shalt thou behold him in thy halls, king of Temora of groves!” “Soon may I behold the chief!” replied the blue-eyed king. “But my soul is sad for Cuthullin. His voice was pleasant in mine ear. Often have we moved, on Dora, to the chace of the dark-brown hinds. His bow was unerring on the hills. He spoke of mighty men. He told of the deeds of my fathers. I felt my rising joy. But sit thou at the feast, O Carril, I have often heard thy voice. Sing in praise of Cuthullin. Sing of Nathos of Etha! Day rose on Temora, with all the beams of the east. Crathin came to the hall, the son of old Gelláma. “I behold,” he said, “a cloud in the desert, king of Erin! a cloud it seemed at first, but now a crowd of men! One strides before them in his strength. His red hair flies in wind. His shield glitters to the beam of the east. His spear is in his hand.” “Call him to the feast of Temora,” replied the brightening king. “My hall is the house of strangers, son of generous Gelláma! It is perhaps the chief of Etha, coming in all his renown. Hail, mighty stranger! art thou of the friends of Cormac? But Carril, he is dark, and unlovely. He draws his sword. Is that the son of Usnoth, bard of the times of old?” “It is not the son of Usnoth!” said Carril. “It is Cairbar thy foe. Why comest thou in thy arms to Temora? chief of the gloomy brow. Let not thy sword rise against Cormac! Whither dost thou turn thy speed?” He passed on in darkness. He seized the hand of the king. Cormac foresaw his death; the rage of his eyes arose. “Retire, thou chief of Atha! Nathos comes with war. Thou art bold in Cormac's hall, for his arm is weak.” The sword entered the side of the king. He fell in the halls of his fathers. His fair hair is in the dust. His blood is smoking round. Art thou fallen in thy halls!” said Carril. “O son of noble Artho. The shield of Cuthullin was not near. Nor the spear of thy father. Mournful are the mountains of Erin, for the chief of the people is low! Blest be thy soul, O Cormac! Thou art darkened in thy youth.” His words came to the ear of Cairbar. He closed us in the midst of darkness. He feared to stretch his sword to the bards, though his soul was dark. Long we pined alone! At length the noble Cathmor came. He heard our voice from the cave. He turned the eye of his wrath on Cairbar. “Brother of Cathmor,” he said, “how long wilt thou pain my soul? Thy heart is a rock. Thy thoughts are dark and bloody! But thou art the brother of Cathmor; and Cathmor shall shine in thy war. But my soul is not like thine: thou feeble hand in fight! The light of my bosom is stained with thy deeds. Bards will not sing of my renown: They may say, “Cathmor was brave; but he fought for gloomy Cairbar.” They will pass over my tomb in silence. My fame shall not be heard. Cairbar! loose the bards. They are the sons of future times. Their voice shall be heard in other years; after the kings of Temora have failed.” We came forth at the words of the chief. We saw him in his strength. He was like thy youth, O Fingal, when thou first didst lift the spear. His face was like the plain of the sun, when it is bright. No darkness travelled over his brow. But he came with his thousands to aid the red-haired Cairbar. Now he comes to revenge his death, O king of woody Morven.” “Let Cathmor come, replied the king. “I love a foe so great. His soul is bright. His arm is strong. His battles are full of fame. But the little soul is a vapour that hovers round the marshy lake. It never rises on the green hill lest the winds should meet it there. Its dwelling is in the cave, it sends forth the dart of death! Our young heroes, O warriors, are like the renown of our fathers. They fight in youth. They fall. Their names are in song. Fingal is amid his darkening years. He must not fall, as an aged oak, across a secret stream. Near it are the steps of the hunter, as it lies beneath the wind. “How has that tree fallen?” he says, and, whistling, strides along. Raise the song of joy, ye bards of Morven. Let our souls forget the past. The red stars look on us from clouds, and silently descend. Soon shall the grey beam of the morning rise, and shew us the foes of Cormac. Fillan! my son, take thou the spear of the king. Go to Mora's dark-brown side. Let thine eyes travel over the heath. Observe the foes of Fingal: Observe the course of generous Cathmor. I hear a distant sound, like falling rocks in the desert. But strike thou thy shield, at times, that they may not come through night, and the fame of Morven cease. I begin to be alone, my son. I dread the fall of my renown!” The voice of bards arose. The king leaned on the shield of Trenmor. Sleep descended on his eyes. His future battles arose in his dreams. The host are sleeping around. Dark-haired Fillan observes the foe. His steps are on a distant hill. We hear, at times, his clanging shield. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. This book opens, we may suppose, about midnight, with a soliloquy of Ossian, who had retired, from the rest of the army, to mourn for his son Oscar. Upon hearing the noise of Cathmor's army approaching, he went to find out his brother Fillan, who kept the watch, on the hill of Mora, in the front of Fingal's army. In the conversation of the brothers, the episode of Conar the son of Trenmor, who was the first king of Ireland, is introduced, which lays open the origin of the contests between the Caël and Firbolg, the two nations who first possessed themselves of that island. Ossian kindles a fire on Mora; upon which Cathmor desisted from the design he had formed of surprising the army of the Caledonians. He calls a council of his chiefs; reprimands Foldath for advising a night-attack, as the Irish army were so much superior in number to the enemy. The bard Fonar introduces the story of Crothar, the ancestor of the king; which throws further light on the history of Ireland, and the original pretensions of the family of Atha, to the throne of that kingdom. The Irish chiefs lie down to rest, and Cathmor himself undertakes the watch. In his circuit round the army, he is met by Ossian. The interview of the two heroes described. Cathmor obtains a promise from Ossian, to order a funeral elegy to be sung over the grave of Cairbar; it being the opinion of the times that the souls of the dead could not be happy till their elegies were sung by a bard. Morning comes. Cathmor and Ossian part; and the latter, casually meeting with Carril, the son of Kinfena, sends that bard, with a funeral song, to the tomb of Cairbar. Macpherson. Father of heroes! O Trenmor! High dweller of eddying winds! where the dark red thunder marks the troubled clouds! Open thou thy stormy halls. Let the bards of old be near. Let them draw near, with songs and their half-viewless harps. No dweller of misty valley comes! No hunter unknown at his streams! It is the car-borne Oscar, from the fields of war. Sudden is thy change, my son, from what thou wert on dark Moilena! The blast folds thee in its skirt, and rustles through the sky! Dost thou not behold thy father, at the stream of night! The chiefs of Morven sleep far distant. They have lost no son: But ye have lost a hero, chiefs of resounding Morven! Who could equal his strength, when battle rolled against his side, like the darkness of crowded waters? Why this cloud on Ossian's soul? It ought to burn in danger. Erin is near with her host. The king of Selma is alone. Alone thou shalt not be, my father, while I can lift the spear! I rose, in all my arms. I rose and listened to the wind. The shield of Fillan is not heard. I tremble for the son of Fingal. “Why should the foe come by night? Why should the darkhaired warrior fail?” Distant, silent murmurs rise: like the noise of the lake of Lego, when its waters shrink, in the days of frost, and all its bursting ice resounds. The people of Lara look to heaven, and foresee the storm! My steps are forward on the heath. The spear of Oscar is in my hand! Red stars looked from high. I gleamed, along the night. I saw Fillan silent before me, bending forward from Mora's rock. He heard the shout of the foe. The joy of his soul arose. He heard my sounding tread, and turned his lifted spear. “Comest thou, son of night, in peace? Or dost thou meet my wrath? The foes of Fingal are mine. Speak, or fear my steel. I stand not, in vain, the shield of Morven's race.” “Never mayst thou stand in vain, son of blue-eyed Clatho! Fingal begins to be alone. Darkness gathers on the last of his days. Yet he has two sons who ought to shine in war. Who ought to be two beams of light near the steps of his departure.” “Son of Fingal,” replied the youth, “it is not long since I raised the spear. Few are the marks of my sword in war. But Fillan's soul is fire! The chiefs of Bolga crowd around the shield of generous Cathmor. Their gathering is on that heath. Shall my steps approach their host? I yielded to Oscar alone, in the strife of the race, on Cona!” “Fillan, thou shalt not approach their host; nor fall before thy fame is known. My name is heard in song: when needful I advance. From the skirts of night I shall view them over all their gleaming tribes. Why, Fillan, didst thou speak of Oscar? Why awake my sigh! I must forget the warrior, till the storm is rolled away. Sadness ought not to dwell in danger, nor the tear in the eye of war. Our fathers forgot their fallen sons, till the noise of arms was past. Then sorrow returned to the tomb, and the song of bards arose.” The memory of those, who fell, quickly followed the departure of war: When the tumult of battle is past, the soul, in silence, melts away, for the dead. Conar was the brother of Trathal, first of mortal men. His battles were on every coast. A thousand streams rolled down the blood of his foes. His fame filled green Erin, like a pleasant gale. The nations gathered in Ullin, and they blessed the king; the king of the race of their fathers, from the land of Selma. The chiefs of the south were gathered, in the darkness of their pride. In the horrid cave of Moma, they mixed their secret words. Thither often, they said, the spirits of their fathers came; shewing their pale forms from the chinky rocks: reminding them of the honour of Bolga. “Why should Conar reign,” they said, “the son of resounding Morven?” They came forth, like the streams of the desert, with the roar of their hundred tribes. Conar was a rock before them: broken they rolled on every side. But often they returned, and the sons of Selma fell. The king stood, among the tombs of his warriors. He darkly bent his mournful face. His soul was rolled into itself; and he had marked the place, where he was to fall; when Trathal came, in his strength, his brother from cloudy Morven. Nor did he come alone. Colgar was at his side; Colgar the son of the king and of white-bosomed Solin-corma. As Trenmor, clothed with meteors, descends from the halls of thunder, pouring the dark storm before him over the troubled sea: so Colgar descended to battle, and wasted the echoing field. His father rejoiced over the hero: but an arrow came! His tomb was raised, without a tear. The king was to revenge his son. He lightened forward in battle, till Bolga yielded at her streams! When peace returned to the land: When his blue waves bore the king to Morven: then he remembered his son, and poured the silent tear. Thrice did the bards, at the cave of Furmono, call the soul of Colgar. They called him to the hills of his land. He heard them in his mist. Trathal placed his sword in the cave, that the spirit of his son might rejoice. “Colgar, son of Trathal,” said Fillan, “thou wert renowned in youth! But the king hath not marked my sword, bright-srreaming on the field. I go forth with the crowd. I return, without my fame. But the foe approaches, Ossian! I hear their murmur on the heath. The sound of their steps is like thunder, in the bosom of the ground, when the rocking hills shake their groves, and not a blast pours from the darkened sky!” Ossian turned sudden on the spear. He raised the flame of an oak on high. I spread it large, on Mora's wind. Cathmor stopt in his course. Gleaming he stood, like a rock, on whose sides are the wandering of blasts; which seize its echoing streams and clothe them over with ice. So stood the friend of strangers! The winds lift his heavy locks. Thou art the tallest of the race of Erin, king of streamy Atha! “First of bards,” said Cathmor, “Fonar, call the chiefs of Erin. Call red-haired Cormar: dark-browed Malthos: the side-long-looking gloom of Maronan. Let the pride of Foldath appear. The red-rolling eye of Turlutho. Nor let Hidalla be forgot; his voice, in danger, is the sound of a shower, when it falls in the blasted vale, near Atha's falling stream. Pleasant is its sound on the plain, whilst broken thunder travels over the sky.” They came, in their clanging arms. They bent forward to his voice, as if a spirit of their fathers spoke from a cloud of night. Dreadful shone they to the light; like the fall of the stream of Brumo, when the meteor lights it, before the nightly stranger. Shuddering, he stops in his journey, and looks up for the beam of the morn! “Why delights Foldath,” said the king, “to pour the blood of foes, by night? Fails his arm in battle, in the beams of day? Few are the foes before us, why should we clothe us in shades? The valiant delight to shine in the battles of their land! Thy counsel was in vain, chief of Moma! The eyes of Morven do not sleep. They are watchful, as eagles, on their mossy rocks. Let each collect, beneath his cloud, the strength of his roaring tribe. To-morrow I move, in light, to meet the foes of Bolga! Mighty was he, that is low, the race of Borbar-Duthul!” “Not unmarked!” said Foldath, “were my steps before thy race. In light, I met the foes of Cairbar. The warrior praised my deeds. But his stone was raised without a tear! No bard sung over Erin's king. Shall his foes rejoice along their mossy hills? No: they must not rejoice! He was the friend of Foldath! Our words were mixed, in secret, in Moma's silent cave; whilst thou, a boy in the field, pursuedst the thistle's beard. With Moma's sons I shall rush abroad, and find the foe, on his dusky hills. Fingal shall lie, without his song, the grey-haired king of Selma.” “Dost thou think, thou feeble man,” replied Cathmor, half-enraged: “Dost thou think Fingal can fall, without his fame, in Erin? Could the bards be silent, at the tomb of Selma's king? The song would burst in secret! the spirit of the king would rejoice! It is when thou shalt fall, that the bard shall forget the song. Thou art dark, chief of Moma, though thine arm is a tempest in war. Do I forget the king of Erin, in his narrow house? My soul is not lost to Cairbar, the brother of my love! I marked the bright beams of joy, which travelled over his cloudy mind, when I returned, with fame, to Atha of the streams.” Tall they removed, beneath the words of the king. Each to his own dark tribe; where, humming, they rolled on the heath, faint-glittering to the stars: like waves, in a rocky bay, before the nightly wind. Beneath an oak, lay the chief of Atha. His shield, a dusky round, hung high. Near him, against a rock, leaned the fair stranger of Inis-huna: that beam of light, with wandering locks, from Lumon of the roes. At distance rose the voice of Fonar, with the deeds of the days of old. The song fails, at times, in Lubar's growing roar! “Crothar,” begun the bard, “first dwelt at Atha's mossy streams! A thousand oaks, from the mountains, formed his echoing hall. The gathering of the people was there, around the feast of the blue-eyed king. But who, among his chiefs, was like the stately Crothar? Warriors kindled in his presence. The young sigh of the virgins rose. In Alnecma was the warrior honoured: the first of the race of Bolga. “He pursued the chace in Ullin: on the moss-covered top of Drumardo. From the wood looked the daughter of Cathmin, the blue-rolling eye of Con-lama. Her sigh rose in secret. She bent her head amidst her wandering locks. The moon looked in, at night, and saw the white-tossing of her arms; for she thought of the mighty Crothar, in the season of dreams. “Three days feasted Crothar with Cathmin. On the fourth they awaked the hinds. Conlama moved to the chace, with all her lovely steps. She met Crothar in the narrow path. The bow fell, at once, from her hand. She turned her face away, and half-hid it with her locks. The love of Crothar rose. He brought the white-bosomed maid to Atha. Bards raised the song in her presence. Joy dwelt round the daughter of Cathmin. “The pride of Turloch rose, a youth who loved the white-handed Con-láma. He came, with battle, to Alnecma; to Atha of the roes. Cormul went forth to the strife, the brother of car-borne Crothal. He went forth, but he fell. The sigh of the people rose. Silent and tall, across the stream, came the darkening strength of Crothar: he rolled the foe from Alnecma. He returned midst the joy of Con-láma. “Battle on battle comes. Blood is poured on blood. The tombs of the valiant rise. Erin's clouds are hung round with ghosts. The chiefs of the south gathered round the echoing shield of Crothar. He came, with death, to the paths of the foe. The virgins wept by the streams of Ullin. They looked to the mist of the hill: No hunter descended from its folds. Silence darkened in the land. Blasts sighed lonely on grassy tombs. “Descending like the eagle of heaven, with all his rustling wings, when he forsakes the blast with joy, the son of Trenmor came; Conar, arm of death, from Morven of the groves. He poured his might along green Erin. Death dimly strode behind his sword. The sons of Bolga fled, from his course, as from a stream, that bursting from the stormy desert, rolls the fields together, with all their echoing woods. Crothar met him in battle: but Alnecma's warriors fled. The king of Atha slowly retired, in the grief of his soul. He afterwards shone in the south; but dim as the sun of autumn; when he visits, in his robes of mist, Lara of dark streams. The withered grass is covered with dew: the field, though bright, is sad!” “Why wakes the bard before me,” said Cathmor, “the memory of those who fled? Has some ghost, from his dusky cloud, bent forward to thine ear; to frighten Cathmor from the field, with the tales of old? Dwellers of the skirts of night, your voice is but a blast to me; which takes the grey thistle's head, and strews its beard on streams. Within my bosom is a voice. Others hear it not. His soul forbids the king of Erin to shrink back from war.” Abashed the bard sinks back in night: retired he bends above a stream. His thoughts are on the days of Atha, when Cathmor heard his song with joy. His tears came rolling down. The winds are in his beard. Erin sleeps around. No sleep comes down on Cathmor's eyes. Dark, in his soul, he saw the spirit of low-laid Cairbar. He saw him, without his song, rolled in a blast of night. He rose. His steps were round the host. He struck, at times, his echoing shield. The sound reached Ossian's ear, on Mora's mossy brow. “Fillan,” I said, “the foes advance. I hear the shield of war. Stand thou in the narrow path. Ossian shall mark their course. If over my fall the host should pour, then be thy buckler heard. Awake the king on his heath, lest his fame should fly away.” I strode in all my rattling arms; wide-bounding over a stream that darkly-winded, in the field, before the king of Atha. Green Atha's king, with lifted spear, came forward on my course. Now would we have mixed in horrid fray, like two contending ghosts, that bending forth, from two clouds, send forth the roaring winds; did not Ossian behold, on high, the helmet of Erin's kings. The eagle's wing spread above it, rustling in the breeze. A red star looked through the plumes. I stopt the lifted spear. “The helmet of kings is before me! Who art thou, son of night? Shall Ossian's spear be renowned, when thou art lowly-laid?” At once he dropt the gleaming lance. Growing before me seemed the form. He stretched his hand in night. He spoke the words of kings. “Friend of the spirits of heroes, do I meet thee thus in shades? I have wished for thy stately steps in Atha, in the days of joy. Why should my spear now arise? The sun must behold us, Ossian; when we bend, gleaming, in the strife. Future warriors shall mark the place: and, shuddering, think of other years. They shall mark it, like the haunt of ghosts, pleasant and dreadful to the soul.” “Shall it then be forgot,” I said, “where we meet in peace? Is the remembrance of battles always pleasant to the soul? Do not we behold, with joy, the place where our fathers feasted? But our eyes are full of tears, on the fields of their war. This stone shall rise, with all its moss, and speak to other years. “Here Cathmor and Ossian met! the warriors met in peace!” When thou, O stone, shalt fail: When Lubar's stream shall roll away! then shall the traveller come, and bend here, perhaps, in rest. When the darkened moon is rolled over his head, our shadowy forms may come, and, mixing with his dreams, remind him of this place. But why turnest thou so dark away, son of Borbar-duthul?” “Not forgot, son of Fingal, shall we ascend these winds. Our deeds are streams of light, before the eyes of bards. But darkness is rolled on Atha: the king is low, without his song: still there was a beam towards Cathmor from his stormy soul; like the moon, in a cloud, amidst the dark-red course of thunder.” “Son of Erin,” I replied, “my wrath dwells not in his earth. My hatred flies, on eagle-wing, from the foe that is low. He shall hear the song of bards. Cairbar shall rejoice on his winds.” Cathmor's swelling soul arose. He took the dagger from his side, and placed it gleaming in my hand. He placed it in my hand, with sighs, and, silent, strode away. Mine eyes followed his departure. He dimly gleamed, like the form of a ghost, which meets a traveller, by night, on the dark-skirted heath. His words are dark like songs of old: with morning strides the unfinished shade away! Who comes from Lubar's vale? From the skirts of the morning mist? The drops of heaven are on his head. His steps are in the paths of the sad. It is Carril of other times. He comes from Tura's silent cave. I behold it dark in the rock, through the thin folds of mist. There, perhaps, Cuthullin sits, on the blast which bends its trees. Pleasant is the song of the morning from the bard of Erin! “The waves crowd away,” said Carril. “They crowd away for fear. They hear the sound of thy coming forth, O sun! Terrible is thy beauty, son of heaven, when death is descending on thy locks; when thou rollest thy vapours before thee, over the blasted host. But pleasant is thy beam to the hunter, sitting by the rock in a storm, when thou shewest thyself from the parted cloud, and brightenest his dewy locks: he looks down on the streamy vale, and beholds the descent of roes! How long shalt thou rise on war, and roll, a bloody shield, through heaven? I see the death of heroes, dark wandering over thy face!” “Why wander the words of Carril?” I said. “Does the son of heaven mourn! He is unstained in his course, ever rejoicing in his fire. Roll on, thou careless light. Thou too, perhaps, must fall. Thy darkening hour may seize thee, struggling, as thou rollest through thy sky. But pleasant is the voice of the bard; pleasant to Ossian's soul! It is like the shower of the morning, when it comes through the rustling vale, on which the sun looks through mist, just rising from his rocks. But this is no time, O bard, to sit down at the strife of song. Fingal is in arms on the vale. Thou seest the flaming shield of the king. His face darkens between his locks. He beholds the wide rolling of Erin. Does not Carril behold that tomb beside the roaring stream! Three stones lift their grey heads beneath a bending oak. A king is lowly laid! Give thou his soul to the wind. He is the brother of Cathmor! Open his airy hall! Let thy song be a stream of joy to Cairbar's darkened ghost.” BOOK III. ARGUMENT. Morning coming on, Fingal, after a speech to his people, devolves the command on Gaul, the son of Morni; it being the custom of the times, that the king should not engage till the necessity of affairs required his superior valour and conduct. The king and Ossian retire to the rock of Cormul, which overlooked the field of battle. The bards sing the war-song. The general conflict is described. Gaul, the son of Morni, distinguishes himself; kills Tur-lathon, chief of Moruth, and other chiefs of lesser name. On the other hand, Foldath, who commanded the Irish army, (for Cathmor, after the example of Fingal, kept himself from battle) fights gallantly; kills Connal, chief of Dun-lora, and advances to engage Gaul himself. Gaul, in the mean time, being wounded in the hand, by a random arrow, is covered by Fillan, the son of Fingal, who performs prodigies of valour. Night comes on. The horn of Fingal reealls his army. The bards meet them, with a congratulatory song, in which the praises of Gaul and Fillan are particularly celebrated. The chiefs sit down at a feast; Fingal misses Connal. The episode of Connal and Duth-caron is introduced; which throws further light on the ancient history of Ireland. Carril is dispatched to raise the tomb of Connal. The action of this book takes up the second day, from the opening of the poem. Macpherson. Who is that at blue-streaming Lubar? Who, by the bending hill of roes? Tall, he leans on an oak torn from high, by nightly winds. Who but Comhal's son, brightening in the last of his fields? His grey hair is on the breeze. He half unsheaths the sword of Luno. His eyes are turned to Moi-lena, to the dark moving of foes. Dost thou hear the voice of the king? It is like the bursting of a stream in the desert, when it comes, between its echoing rocks, to the blasted field of the sun! “Wide-skirted comes down the foe! Sons of woody Selma, arise. Be ye like the rocks of our land, on whose brown sides are the rolling of streams. A beam of joy comes on my soul. I see the foe mighty before me. It is when he is feeble, that the sighs of Fingal are heard: lest death should come, without renown, and darkness dwell on his tomb. Who shall lead the war against the host of Alnecma? It is only when danger grows that my sword shall shine. Such was the custom, heretofore, of Trenmor, the ruler of winds! and thus descended to battle the blue-shielded Trathal!” The chiefs bend toward the king. Each darkly seems to claim the war. They tell, by halves, their mighty deeds. They turn their eyes on Erin. But far before the rest the son of Morni stands. Silent he stands; for who had not heard of the battles of Gaul? They rose within his soul. His hand, in secret, seized the sword. The sword which he brought from Strumon, when the strength of Morni failed. On his spear leans Fillan of Selma, in the wandering of his locks. Thrice he raised his eyes to Fingal: his voice thrice fails him as he speaks. My brother could not boast of battles: at once he strides away. Bent over a distant stream he stands: the tear hangs in his eye. He strikes, at times, the thistle's head, with his inverted spear. Nor is he unseen of Fingal. Sidelong he beholds his son. He beholds him with bursting joy; and turns, amid his crowded soul. In silence turns the king towards Mora of woods. He hides the big tear with his locks. At length his voice is heard. “First of the sons of Morni! Thou rock that defiest the storm! lead thou my battle, for the race of low-laid Cormac. No boy's staff is thy spear: no harmless beam of light thy sword. Son of Morni of steeds, behold the foe! Destroy! Fillan, observe the chief! He is not calm in strife; nor burns he, heedless, in battle. My son, observe the chief! He is strong as Lubar's streams; but never foams and roars. High on cloudy Mora, Fingal shall behold the war. Stand, Ossian, near thy father, by the falling stream. Raise the voice, O bards! Selma, move beneath the sound. It is my latter field. Clothe it over with light.” As the sudden rising of winds, or distant rolling of troubled seas, when some dark ghost, in wrath, heaves the billows over an isle: an isle, the seat of mist, on the deep, for many dark-brown years! So terrible is the sound of the host, wide-moving over the field. Gaul is tall before them. The streams glitter within his strides. The bards raise the song by his side. He strikes his shield between. On the skirts of the blast, the tuneful voices rise. “On Crona,” said the bards, “there bursts a stream by night. It swells in its own dark course, till morning's early beam. Then comes it white from the hill, with the rocks and their hundred groves. Far be my steps from Crona. Death is tumbling there. Be ye a stream from Mora, sons of cloudy Morven!” “Who rises, from his car, on Clutha? The hills are troubled before the king! The dark woods echo round, and lighten at his steel. See him, amidst the foe, like Colgach's sportful ghost; when he scatters the clouds, and rides the eddying winds! It is Morni of bounding steeds! Be like thy father, O Gaul!” “Selma is opened wide. Bards take the trembling harps. Ten youths bear the oak of the feast. A distant sun-beam marks the hill. The dusky waves of the blast fly over the fields of grass. Why art thou silent, O Selma? The king returns with all his fame. Did not the battle roar; yet peaceful is his brow? It roared, and Fingal overcame. Be like thy father, O Fillan!” They move beneath the song. High wave their arms, as rushy fields beneath autumnal winds. On Mora stands the king in arms. Mist flies round his buckler abroad; as, aloft, it hung on a bough, on Cormul's mossy rock. In silence I stood by Fingal, and turned my eyes on Cromla's wood: lest I should behold the host, and rush amid my swelling soul. My foot is forward on the heath. I glittered, tall, in steel; like the falling stream of Tromlo, which nightly winds bind over with ice. The boy sees it, on high, gleaming to the early beam: toward it he turns his ear, and wonders why it is so silent! Nor bent over a stream is Cathmor, like a youth in a peaceful field. Wide he drew forward the war, a dark and troubled wave. But when he beheld Fingal on Mora, his generous pride arose; “Shall the chief of Atha fight, and no king in the field? Foldath, lead my people forth. Thou art a beam of fire.” Forth issues Foldath of Moma, like a cloud, the robe of ghosts. He drew his sword, a flame, from his side. He bade the battle move. The tribes, like ridgy waves, dark pour their strength around. Haughty is his stride before them. His red eye rolls in wrath. He calls Cormul chief of Dunratho; and his words were heard. “Cormul, thou beholdest that path. It winds green behind the foe. Place thy people there, lest Selma should escape from my sword. Bards of green-vallied Erin, let no voice of yours arise. The sons of Morven must fall without song. They are the foes of Cairbar. Hereafter shall the traveller meet their dark thick mist on Lena, where it wanders, with their ghosts, beside the reedy lake. Never shall they rise, without song, to the dwelling of winds.” Cormul darkened, as he went. Behind him rushed his tribe. They sunk beyond the rock. Gaul spoke to Fillan of Selma; as his eye pursued the course of the dark-eyed chief of Dunratho. “Thou beholdest the steps of Cormul! Let thine arm be strong! When he is low, son of Fingal, remember Gaul in war. Here I fall forward into battle, amid the ridge of shields.” The sign of death ascends; the dreadful sound of Morni's shield. Gaul pours his voice between. Fingal rises on Mora. He saw them, from wing to wing, bending at once in strife. Gleaming, on his own dark hill, stood Cathmor of streamy Atha. The kings were like two spirits of heaven, standing each on his gloomy cloud; when they pour abroad the winds, and lift the roaring seas. The blue-tumbling of waves is before them, marked with the paths of whales. They themselves are calm and bright. The gale lifts slowly their locks of mist! What beam of light hangs high on air! What beam, but Morni's dreadful sword! Death is strewed on thy paths, O Gaul! Thou foldest them together in thy rage. Like a young oak falls Tur-lathon, with his branches round him. His high-bosomed spouse stretches her white arms, in dreams, to the returning chief, as she sleeps by gurgling Moruth, in her disordered locks. It is his ghost, Oichoma. The chief is lowly laid. Hearken not to the winds for Turlathon's echoing shield. It is pierced by his streams. Its sound is past away. Not peaceful is the hand of Foldath. He winds his course in blood. Connal met him in fight. They mixed their clanging steel. Why should mine eyes behold them! Connal, thy locks are grey! Thou wert the friend of strangers, at the moss-covered rock of Dun-lora. When the skies were rolled together; then thy feast was spread. The stranger heard the winds without; and rejoiced at thy burning oak. Why, son of Duthcaron, art thou laid in blood! The blasted tree bends above thee. Thy shield lies broken near. Thy blood mixes with the stream, thou breaker of the shields! Ossian took the spear in his wrath. But Gaul rushed forward on Foldath. The feeble pass by his side; his rage is turned on Moma's chief. Now they had raised their deathful spears: unseen an arrow came. It pierced the hand of Gaul. His steel fell sounding to earth. Young Fillan came, with Cormul's shield! He stretched it large before the chief. Foldath sent his shouts abroad, and kindled all the field: as a blast that lifts the wide-winged flame, over Lumon's echoing groves. “Son of blue-eyed Clatho,” said Gaul, “O Fillan, thou art a beam from heaven, that, coming on the troubled deep, binds up the tempest's wing. Cormul is fallen before thee. Early art thou in the fame of thy fathers. Rush not too far, my hero. I cannot lift the spear to aid. I stand harmless in battle; but my voice shall be poured abroad. The sons of Selma shall hear, and remember my former deeds.” His terrible voice rose on the wind. The host bends forward in fight. Often had they heard him, at Strumon, when he called them to the chace of the hinds. He stands tall, amid the war, as an oak in the skirts of a storm, which now is clothed on high, in mist; then shews its broad waving head. The musing hunter lifts his eye from his own rushy field! My soul pursues thee, O Fillan, through the path of thy fame. Thou rolledst the foe before thee. Now Foldath, perhaps, may fly: but night comes down with its clouds. Cathmor's horn is heard on high. The sons of Selma hear the voice of Fingal from Mora's gathered mist. The bards pour their song, like dew, on the returning war. “Who comes from Strumon,” they said, “amid her wandering locks? She is mournful in her steps, and lifts her blue eyes toward Erin. Why art thou sad, Evir-choma? Who is like thy chief in renown? He descended dreadful to battle; he returns, like a light from a cloud. He raised the sword in wrath: they shrunk before blue-shielded Gaul!” “Joy, like the rustling gale, comes on the soul of the king. He remembers the battles of old; the days wherein his fathers fought. The days of old return on Fingal's mind, as he beholds the renown of his son. As the sun rejoices, from his cloud, over the tree his beams have raised, as it shakes its lonely head on the heath; so joyful is the king over Fillan!” “As the rolling of thunder on hills, when Lara's fields are still and dark; such are the steps of Selma, pleasant and dreadful to the ear. They return with their sound, like eagles to their dark-browed rock, after the prey is torn on the field, the dun sons of the bounding hind. Your fathers rejoice from their clouds, sons of streamy Selma!” Such was the nightly voice of bards, on Mora of the hinds. A flame rose, from an hundred oaks, which winds had torn from Cormul's steep. The feast is spread in the midst: around sat the gleaming chiefs. Fingal is there in his strength. The eagle-wing of his helmet sounds. The rustling blasts of the west, unequal rush through night. Long looks the king in silence round: at length his words are heard. “My soul feels a want in our joy. I behold a breach among my friends. The head of one tree is low. The squally wind pours in on Selma. Where is the chief of Dun-lora? Ought Connal to be forgot at the feast? When did he forget the stranger, in the midst of his echoing hall? Ye are silent in my presence! Connal is then no more. Joy meet thee, O warrior, like a stream of light. Swift be thy course to thy fathers, along the roaring winds. Ossian, thy soul is fire: kindle the memory of the king. Awake the battles of Connal, when first he shone in war. The locks of Connal were grey. His days of youth were mixed with mine. In one day Duthcaron first strung our bows against the roes of Dun-lora.” “Many,” I said, “are our paths to battle, in green vallied Erin. Often did our sails arise, over the blue tumbling waves; when we came, in other days, to aid the race of Conar. The strife roared once in Alnecma, at the foam-covered streams of Duth-úla. With Cormac descended to battle Duthcaron from cloudy Selma. Nor descended Duthcaron alone, his son was by his side, the long-haired youth of Connal lifting the first of his spears. Thou didst command them, O Fingal, to aid the king of Erin. “Like the bursting strength of ocean, the sons of Bolga rushed to war. Colc-ulla was before them, the chief of blue-streaming Atha. The battle was mixed on the plain. Cormac shone in his own strife, bright as the forms of his fathers. But, far before the rest, Duthcaron hewed down the foe. Nor slept the arm of Connal by his father's side. Colc-ulla prevailed on the plain: like scattered mist fled the people of Cormac! “Then rose the sword of Duthcaron, and the steel of broad-shielded Connal. They shaded their flying friends, like two rocks with their heads of pine. Night came down on Duth-ula: silent strode the chiefs over the field. A mountain-stream roared across the path, nor could Duthcaron bound over its course. Why stands my father? said Connal. I hear the rushing foe.” “Fly, Connal,” he said. “Thy father's strength begins to fail. I come wounded from battle. Here let me rest in night.” “But thou shalt not remain alone,” said Connal's bursting sigh. “My shield is an eagle's wing to cover the king of Dun-lora.” He bends dark above his father. The mighty Duthcaron dies.” Day rose, and night returned. No lonely bard appeared, deep-musing on the heath: and could Connal leave the tomb of his father, till he should receive his fame? He bent the bow against the rose of Duth-ula. He spread the lonely feast. Seven nights he laid his head on the tomb, and saw his father in his dreams. He saw him rolled, dark, in a blast, like the vapour of reedy Lego. At length the steps of Colgan came, the bard of high Temora. Duthcaron received his fame, and brightened as he rose on the wind.” “Pleasant to the ear,” said Fingal, “is the praise of the kings of men; when their bows are strong in battle; when they soften at the sight of the sad. Thus let my name be renowned, when bards shall lighten my rising soul. Carril, son of Kinfena! take the bards and raise a tomb. Tonight let Connal dwell within his narrow house. Let not the soul of the valiant wander on the winds. Faint glimmers the moon on Moi-lena, through the broad-headed groves of the hill! Raise stones, beneath its beam, to all the fallen in war. Though no chiefs were they, yet their hands were strong in fight. They were my rock in danger. The mountain from which I spread my eagle-wings. Thence am I renowned. Carril, forget not the low!” Loud, at once, from the hundred bards, rose the song of the tomb. Carril strode before them, they are the murmur of streams behind his steps. Silence dwells in the vales of Moi-lena, where each, with its own dark rill, is winding between the hills. I heard the voice of the bards, lessening, as they moved along. I leaned forward from my shield; and felt the kindling of my soul. Half-formed, the words of my song burst forth upon the wind. So hears a tree, on the vale, the voice of spring around. It pours its green leaves to the sun. It shakes its lonely head. The hum of the mountain-bee is near it; the hunter sees it, with joy, from the blasted heath. Young Fillan at a distance stood. His helmet lay glittering on the ground. His dark hair is loose to the blast. A beam of light is Clatho's son! He heard the words of the king with joy. He leaned forward on his spear. “My son,” said car-borne Fingal, “I saw thy deeds, and my soul was glad. The fame of our fathers, I said, burst from its gathering cloud. Thou art brave, son of Clatho; but headlong in the strife. So did not Fingal advance, though he never feared a foe. Let thy people be a ridge behind. They are thy strength in the field. Then shalt thou be long renowned, and behold the tombs of the old. The memory of the past returns, my deeds in other years; when first I descended from ocean on the green-vallied isle.” We bend towards the voice of the king. The moon looks abroad from her cloud. The grey-skirted mist is near; the dwelling of the ghosts! BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. The second night continues. Fingal relates, at the feast, his own first expedition into Ireland, and his marriage with Roscrána, the daughter of Cormac, king of that island. The Irish chiefs convene in the presence of Cathmor. The situation of the king described. The story of Sul-malla, the daughter of Conmor, king of Inis-huna, who, in the disguise of a young warrior, had followed Cathmor to the war. The sullen behaviour of Foldath, who had commanded in the battle of the preceding day, renews the difference between him and Malthos; but Cathmor interposing, ends it. The chiefs feast, and hear the song of Fonar the bard. Cathmor returns to rest, at a distance from the army. The ghost of his brother Cairbar appears to him in a dream, and obscurely foretels the issue of the war. The soliloquy of the king. He discovers Sul-malla. Morning comes. Her soliloquy closes the book. Macpherson. “Beneath an oak,” said the king, “I sat on Selma's streamy rock, when Connal rose, from the sea, with the broken speár of Duth-caron. Far-distant stood the youth. He turned away his eyes. He remembered the steps of his father, on his own green hills. I darkened in my place. Dusky thoughts flew over my soul. The kings of Erin rose before me. I half-unsheathed the sword. Slowly approached the chiefs. They lifted up their silent eyes. Like a ridge of clouds, they wait for the bursting forth of my voice. My voice was, to them, a wind from heaven to roll the mist away.” “I bade my white sails to rise, before the roar of Cona's wind. Three hundred youths looked, from their waves, on Fingal's bossy shield. High on the mast it hung, and marked the dark-blue sea. But when night came down, I struck, at times, the warning boss: I struck, and looked on high, for fiery-haired Ul-erin. Nor absent was the star of heaven. It travelled red between the clouds. I pursued the lovely beam, on the faint-gleaming deep. With morning Erin rose in mist. We came into the bay of Moi-lena, where its blue waters tumbled, in the bosom of echoing woods. Here Cormac, in his secret hall, avoids the strength of Colc-ulla. Nor he alone avoids the foe. The blue eye of Ros-crána is there: Ros-crána, white-handed maid, the daughter of the king!” “Grey, on his pointless spear, came forth the aged steps of Cormac. He smiled, from his waving locks; but grief was in his soul. He saw us few before him, and his sigh arose. “I see the arms of Trenmor,” he said; “and these are the steps of the king! Fingal! thou art a beam of light to Cormac's darkened soul. Early is thy fame, my son; but strong are the foes of Erin. They are like the roar of streams in the land, son of car-borne Comhal!” “Yet they may be rolled away,” I said, in my rising soul. “We are not of the race of the feeble, king of blue-shielded hosts! Why should fear come among us, like a ghost of night? The soul of the valiant grows, when foes increase in the field. Roll no darkness, king of Erin, on the young in war!” “The bursting tears of the king came down. He seized my hand in silence. “Race of the daring Trenmor!” at length he said, “I roll no cloud before thee. Thou burnest in the fire of thy fathers. I behold thy fame. It marks thy course in battle, like a stream of light. But wait the coming of Cairbar; my son must join thy sword. He calls the sons of Erin, from all their distant streams.” “We came to the hall of the king, where it rose in the midst of rocks, on whose dark sides were the marks of streams of old. Broad oaks bend around with their moss. The thick birch is waving near. Half-hid, in her shady grove, Ros-crána raises the song. Her white hands move on the harp. I beheld her blue rolling eyes. She was like a spirit of heaven half-folded in the skirt of a cloud! “Three days we feasted at Moi-lena. She rises bright in my troubled soul. Cormac beheld me dark. He gave the white-bosomed maid. She comes with bending eye, amid the wandering of her heavy locks. She came! Straight the battle roared. Colc-ulla appeared: I took my spear. My sword rose, with my people, against the ridgy foe. Alnecma fled. Colc-ulla fell. Fingal returned with fame. “Renowned is he, O Fillan, who fights in the strength of his host. The bard pursues his steps, through the land of the foe. But he who fights alone, few are his deeds to other times! He shines, to-day, a mighty light. To-morrow, he is low. One song contains his fame. His name is on one dark field. He is forgot; but where his tomb sends forth the tufted grass.” Such are the words of Fingal, on Mora of the roes. Three bards, from the rock of Cormul, pour down the pleasing song. Sleep descends, in the sound, on the broad-skirted host. Carril returned, with the bards, from the tomb of Dunlora's chief. The voice of Morning shall not come, to the dusky bed of Duth-caron. No more shalt thou hear the tread of roes, around thy narrow-house! As roll the troubled clouds round a meteor of night, when they brighten their sides with its light, along the heaving sea; so gathers Erin, around the gleaming form of Cathmor. He, tall in the midst, careless lifts, at times, his spear: as swells or falls the sound of Fonar's distant harp. Near him leaned, against a rock, Sul-malla of blue eyes, the white-bosomed daughter of Conmor, king of Inis-huna. To his aid came blue-shielded Cathmor, and rolled his foes away. Sul-malla beheld him stately in the hall of feasts. Nor careless rolled the eyes of Cathmor on the long-haired maid! The third day arose, when Fithil came from Erin of the streams. He told of the lifting up of the shield in Selma: He told of the danger of Cairbar. Cathmor raised the sail at Cluba: but the winds were in other lands. Three days he remained on the coast, and turned his eyes on Conmor's halls. He remembered the daughter of strangers, and his sigh arose. Now when the winds awaked the wave: from the hill came a youth in arms; to lift the sword with Cathmor, in his echoing fields. It was the white-armed Sul-malla. Secret she dwelt beneath her helmet. Her steps were in the path of the king; on him her blue eyes rolled with joy, when he lay by his roaring streams! But Cathmor thought, that, on Lumon, she still pursued the roes. He thought, that fair on a rock, she stretched her white hand to the wind, to feel its course from Erin, the green dwelling of her love. He had promised to return, with his white-bosomed sails. The maid is near thee, O Cathmor! leaning on her rock. The tall forms of the chiefs stand around; all but dark-browed Foldath. He leaned against a distant tree, rolled into his haughty soul. His bushy hair whistles in wind. At times, bursts the hum of a song. He struck the tree, at length, in wrath; and rushed before the king! Calm and stately, to the beam of the oak, arose the form of young Hidalla. His hair falls round his blushing cheek, in wreaths of waving light. Soft was his voice in Clon-ra, in the valley of his fathers. Soft was his voice when he touched the harp, in the hall, near his roaring streams! “King of Erin,” said Hidalla, “now is the time to feast. Bid the voice of bards arise. Bid them roll the night away. The soul returns, from song, more terrible to war. Darkness settles on Erin. From hill to hill bend the skirted clouds. Far and grey, on the heath, the dreadful strides of ghosts are seen: the ghosts of those who fell bend forward to their song. Bid, O Cathmor, the harps to rise, to brighten the dead, on their wandering blasts.” “Be all the dead forgot,” said Foldath's bursting wrath. “Did not I fail in the field! Shall I then hear the song? Yet was not my course harmless in war. Blood was a stream around my steps. But the feeble were behind me. The foe has escaped from my sword. In Clonra's vale touch thou the harp. Let Dura answer to the voice of Hidalla. Let some maid look, from the wood, on thy long yellow locks. Fly from Lubar's echoing plain. This is the field of heroes!” “King of Erin,” Malthos said, “it is thine to lead in war. Thou art a fire to our eyes, on the dark-brown field. Like a blast thou hast past over hosts. Thou hast laid them low in blood. But who has heard thy words returning from the field? The wrathful delight in death: Their remembrance rests on the wounds of their spear. Strife is folded in their thoughts: their words are ever heard. Thy course, chief of Moma, was like a troubled stream. The dead were rolled on thy path: but others also lift the spear. We were not feeble behind thee; but the foe was strong.” Cathmor beheld the rising rage, and bending forward of either chief: for, half-unsheathed, they held their swords, and rolled their silent eyes. Now would they have mixed in horrid fray, had not the wrath of Cathmor burned’. He drew his sword: it gleamed through night, to the high-flaming oak! “Sons of pride,” said the king, “allay your swelling souls. Retire in night. Why should my rage arise? Should I contend with both in arms? It is no time for strife! Retire, ye clouds, at my feast. Awake my soul no more.” They sunk from the king on either side; like two columns of morning mist, when the sun rises, between them, on his glittering rocks. Dark is their rolling on either side; each towards its reedy pool! Silent sat the chiefs at the feast. They look, at times, on Atha's king, where he strode, on his rock, amid his settling soul. The host lie along the field. Sleep descends on Moi-lena. The voice of Fonar ascends alone, beneath his distant tree. It ascends in the praise of Cathmor, son of Larthon of Lumon. But Cathmor did not hear his praise. He lay at the roar of a stream. The rustling breeze of night flew over his whistling locks. His brother came to his dreams, half-seen from his low-hung cloud. Joy rose darkly in his face. He had heard the song of Carril. A blast sustained his dark-skirted cloud; which he seized in the bosom of night, as he rose, with his fame, towards his airy hall. Half-mixed with the noise of the stream, he poured his feeble words. “Joy meet the soul of Cathmor. His voice was heard on Moi-lena. The bard gave his song to Cairbar. He travels on the wind. My form is in my father's hall, like the gliding of a terrible light, which darts across the desert in a stormy night. No bard shall be wanting at thy tomb, when thou art lowly laid. The sons of song love the valiant. Cathmor, thy name is a pleasant gale. The mournful sounds arise! On Lubar's field there is a voice! Louder still, ye shadowy ghosts! The dead were full of fame! Shrilly swells the feeble sound. The rougher blast alone is heard! Ah, soon is Cathmor low!” Rolled into himself he flew, wide on the bosom of winds. The old oak felt his departure, and shook its whistling head. Cathmor starts from rest. He takes his deathful spear. He lifts his eyes around. He sees but dark-skirted night. “It was the voice of the king,” he said. “But now his form is gone. Unmarked is your path in the air, ye children of the night. Often, like a reflected beam, are ye seen in the desert wild: but ye retire in your blasts, before our steps approach. Go then, ye feeble race! Knowledge with you there is none! Your joys are weak, and like the dreams of our rest, or the light-winged thought, that flies across the soul. Shall Cathmor soon be low? Darkly laid in his narrow house? Where no morning comes, with her half-opened eyes? Away, thou shade! to fight is mine! All further thought away! I rush forth, on eagle's wings, to seize my beam of fame. In the lonely vale of streams, abides the narrow soul. Years roll on, seasons return, but he is still unknown. In a blast comes cloudy death, and lays his grey head low. His ghost is folded in the vapour of the fenny field. Its course is never on hills, nor mossy vales of wind. So shall not Cathmor depart. No boy in the field was he, who only marks the bed of roes, upon the echoing hills. My issuing forth was with kings. My joy in dreadful plains: where broken hosts are rolled away, like seas before the wind.” So spoke the king of Alnecma, brightening in his rising soul. Valour, like a pleasant flame, is gleaming within his breast. Stately is his stride on the heath! The beam of east is poured around. He saw his grey host on the field, wide-spreading their ridges in light. He rejoiced, like a spirit of heaven, whose steps come forth on the seas, when he beholds them peaceful round, and all the winds are laid. But soon he awakes the waves, and rolls them large to some echoing shore. On the rushy bank of a stream, slept the daughter of Inis-huna. The helmet had fallen from her head. Her dreams were in the lands of her fathers. There morning is on the field. Grey streams leap down from the rocks. The breezes, in shadowy waves, fly over the rushy fields. There is the sound that prepares for the chace. There the moving of warriors from the hall. But tall above the rest is seen the hero of streamy Atha. He bends his eye of love on Sul-malla, from his stately steps. She turns, with pride, her face away, and careless bends the bow. Such were the dreams of the maid, when Cathmor of Atha came. He saw her fair face before him, in the midst of her wandering locks. He knew the maid of Lumon. What should Cathmor do? His sighs arise. His tears come down. But straight he turns away. “This is no time, king of Atha, to awake thy secret soul. The battle is rolled before thee, like a troubled stream.” He struck the warning boss, wherein dwelt the voice of war. Erin rose around him, like the sound of eagle-wings. Sul-malla started from sleep, in her disordered locks. She seized the helmet from earth. She trembled in her place. “Why should they know in Erin of the daughter of Inis-huna?” She remembered the race of kings. The pride of her soul arose! Her steps are behind a rock, by the blue-winding stream of a vale: where dwelt the dark-brown hind ere yet the war arose. Thither came the voice of Cathmor, at times, to Sul-malla's ear. Her soul is darkly sad. She pours her words on wind. “The dreams of Inis-huna departed. They are dispersed from my soul. I hear not the chace in my land. I am concealed in the skirt of war. I look forth from my cloud. No beam appears to light my path. I behold my warrior low; for the broad-shielded king is near, he that overcomes in danger, Fingal from Selma of spears! Spirit of departed Conmor! are thy steps on the bosom of winds? Comest thou, at times, to other lands, father of sad Sul-malla? Thou dost come! I have heard thy voice at night; while yet I rose on the wave to Erin of the streams. The ghost of fathers, they say, call away the souls of their race, while they behold them lonely in the midst of woe. Call me, my father, away! When Cathmor is low on earth. Then shall Sul-malla be lonely in the midst of woe!” BOOK V. ARGUMENT. The poet, after a short address to the harp of Cona, describes the arrangement of both armies on either side of the river Lubar. Fingal gives the command to Fillan; but, at the same time, orders Gaul, the son of Morni, who had been wounded in the hand in the preceding battle, to assist him with his counsel. The army of the Fir-bolg is commanded by Foldath. The general onset is described. The great actions of Fillan. He kills Rothmar and Culmin. But when Fillan conquers, in one wing, Foldath presses hard on the other. He wounds Dermid, the son of Duthno, and puts the whole wing to flight. Dermid deliberates with himself, and, at last, resolves to put a stop to the progress of Foldath, by engaging him in single combat. When the two chiefs were approaching towards one another, Fillan came suddenly to the relief of Dermid; engaged Foldath, and killed him. The behaviour of Malthos towards the fallen Foldath. Fillan puts the whole army of the Fir-bolg to flight. The book closes with an address to Clatho, the mother of that hero. Macpherson. Thou dweller between the shields, that hang on high in Ossian's hall! Descend from thy place, O harp, and let me hear thy voice! Son of Alpin, strike the string. Thou must awake the soul of the bard. The murmur of Lora's stream has rolled the tale away. I stand in the cloud of years. Few are its openings toward the past; and when the vision comes, it is but dim and dark. I hear thee, harp of Selma! my soul returns, like a breeze, which the sun brings back to the vale, where dwelt the lazy mist! Lubar is bright before me in the windings of its vale. On either side, on their hills, rise the tall forms of the kings. Their people are poured around them, bending forward to their words: as if their fathers spoke, descending from the winds. But they themselves are like two rocks in the midst; each with its dark head of pines, when they are seen in the desert, above low-sailing mist. High on their face are streams, which spread their foam on blasts of wind! Beneath the voice of Cathmor pours Erin, like the sound of flame. Wide they come down to Lubar. Before them is the stride of Foldath. But Cathmor retires to his hill, beneath his bending oak. The tumbling of a stream is near the king. He lifts at times his gleaming spear. It is a flame to his people, in the midst of war. Near him stands the daughter of Con-mor, leaning on a rock. She did not rejoice at the strife. Her soul delighted not in blood. A valley spreads green behind the hill, with its three blue streams. The sun is there in silence. The dun mountain-roes come down. On these are turned the eyes of Sul-malla in her thoughtful mood. Fingal beholds Cathmor, on high, the son of Borbar-duthul! he beholds the deep-rolling of Erin, on the darkened plain. He strikes that warning boss, which bids the people to obey; when he sends his chiefs before them to the field of renown. Wide rise their spears to the sun. Their echoing shields reply around. Fear, like a vapour, winds not among the host: for he, the king, is near, the strength of streamy Selma. Gladness brightens the hero. We hear his words with joy. “Like the coming forth of winds, is the sound of Selma's sons! They are mountain waters determined in their course. Hence is Fingal renowned. Hence is his name in other lands. He was not a lonely beam in danger; for your steps were always near! But never was Fingal a dreadful form, in your presence, darkened into wrath. My voice was no thunder to your ears. Mine eyes sent forth no death. When the haughty appeared, I beheld them not. They were forgot at my feasts. Like mist they melted away. A young beam is before you! Few are his paths to war! They are few, but he is valiant. Defend my dark-haired son. Bring Fillan back with joy. Hereafter he may stand alone. His form is like his fathers. His soul is a flame of their fire. Son of car-borne Morni, move behind the youth. Let thy voice reach his ear, from the skirts of war. Not unobserved rolls battle, before thee, breaker of the shields!” The king strode, at once, away to Cormul's lofty rock. Intermitting, darts the light, from his shield, as slow the king of heroes moves. Sidelong rolls his eye o'er the heath, as forming advance the lines. Graceful, fly his half-grey locks, round his kingly features, now lightened with dreadful joy. Wholly mighty is the chief! Behind him dark and slow I moved. Straight came forward the strength of Gaul. His shield hung loose on its thong. He spoke, in haste, to Ossian. “Bind, son of Fingal, this shield! Bind it high to the side of Gaul. The foe may behold it, and think I lift the spear. If I should fall, let my tomb be hid in the field; for fall I must without fame. Mine arm cannot lift the steel. Let not Evir-choma hear it, to blush between her locks. Fillan, the mighty, behold us! Let us not forget the strife. Why should they come, from their hills, to aid our flyin field?” He strode onward, with the sound of his shield. My voice pursued him, as he went. “Can the son of Morni fall without his fame in Erin? But the deeds of the mighty are forgot by themselves. They rush careless over the fields of renown. Their words are never heard!” I rejoiced over the steps of the chief. I strode to the rock of the king, where he sat in his wandering locks, amid the mountain-wind! In two dark ridges bend the hosts, toward each other, at Lubar. Here Foldath rises a pillar of darkness: there brightens the youth of Fillan. Each with his spear in the stream, sent forth the voice of war. Gaul struck the shield of Selma. At once they plunge in battle! Steel pours its gleam on steel: like the fall of streams shone the field, when they mix their foam together, from two dark-browed rocks! Behold he comes, the son of fame! He lays the people low! Death sits on blasts around him! Warriors strew thy paths, O Fillan! Rothmar, the shield of warriors, stood between two chinky rocks. Two oaks, which winds had bent from high, spread their branches on either side. He rolls his darkening eyes on Fillan, and, silent, shades his friends. Fingal saw the approaching fight. The hero's soul arose. But as the stone of Loda falls, shook at once, from rocking Druman-ard, when spirits heave the earth in their wrath; so fell blue-shielded Rothmar. Near are the steps of Culmin. The youth came, bursting into tears. Wrathful he cut the wind, ere yet he mixed his strokes with Fillan. He had first bent the bow with Rothmar, at the rock of his own blue streams. There they had marked the place of the roe, as the sun-beam flew over the fern. Why, son of Cul-allin! Why, Culmin, dost thou rush on that beam of light! It is a fire that consumes. Son of Cul-allin, retire. Your fathers were not equal, in the glittering strife of the field. The mother of Culmin remains in the hall. She looks forth on blue-rolling Strutha. A whirlwind rises, on the stream, dark-eddying round the ghost of her son. His dogs are howling in their place. His shield is bloody in the hall. “Art thou fallen, my fair-haired son, in Erin's dismal war?” As a roe, pierced in secret, lies panting, by her wonted streams; the hunter surveys her feet of wind: He remembers her stately bounding before. So lay the son of Cul-allin, beneath the eye of Fillan. His hair is rolled in a little stream. His blood wanders on his shield. Still his hand holds the sword, that failed him in the midst of danger. “Thou art fallen,” said Fillan, “ere yet thy fame was heard. Thy father sent thee to war. He expects to hear of thy deeds. He is grey, perhaps, at his streams. His eyes are toward Moi-lena. But thou shalt not return, with the spoil of the fallen foe!” Fillan pours the flight of Erin before him, over the resounding heath. But, man on man, fell Morven before the dark-red rage of Foldath: for, far on the field, he poured the roar of half his tribes. Dermid stands before him in wrath. The sons of Selma gathered around. But his shield is cleft by Foldath. His people fly over the heath. Then said the foe, in his pride, “They have fled. My fame begins! Go, Malthos, go bid Cathmor guard the dark-rolling of ocean; that Fingal may not escape from my sword. He must lie on earth. Beside some fen shall his tomb be seen. It shall rise without a song. His ghost shall hover, in mist, over the reedy pool.” Malthos heard, with darkening doubt. He rolled his silent eyes. He knew the pride of Foldath. He looked up to Fingal on his hills: then darkly turning, in doubtful mood, he plunged his sword in war. In Clono's narrow vale, where bend two trees above the stream, dark, in his grief, stood Duthno's silent son. The blood pours from the side of Dermid. His shield is broken near. His spear leans against a stone. Why, Dermid, why so sad? “I hear the roar of battle. My people are alone. My steps are slow on the heath; and no shield is mine. Shall he then prevail? It is then after Dermid is low! I will call thee forth, O Foldath, and meet thee yet in fight.” He took his spear, with dreadful joy. The son of Morni came. “Stay, son of Duthno, stay thy speed. Thy steps are marked with blood. No bossy shield is thine. Why shouldst thou fall unarmed?” “Son of Morni! give thou thy shield. It has often rolled back the war. I shall stop the chief, in his course. Son of Morni! behold that stone! It lifts its grey head through grass. There dwells a chief of the race of Dermid. Place me there in night.” He slowly rose against the hill. He saw the troubled field: The gleaming ridges of battle, disjoined and broken round. As distant fires, on heath by night, now seen as lost in smoke; now rearing their red streams on the hill, as blow or cease the winds: so met the intermitting war the eye of broad-shielded Dermid. Through the host are the strides of Foldath, like some dark ship on wintry waves, when she issues from between two isles, to sport on resounding ocean! Dermid, with rage, beholds his course. He strives to rush along. But he fails amid his steps; and the big tear comes down. He sounds his father's horn. He thrice strikes his bossy shield. He calls thrice the name of Foldath, from his roaring tribes. Foldath, with joy, beholds the chief. He lifts aloft his bloody spear. As a rock is marked with streams, that fell troubled down its side in a storm; so, streaked with wandering blood, is the dark chief of Moma! The host, on either side, withdraw from the contending of kings. They raise at once, their gleaming points. Rushing comes Fillan of Selma. Three paces back Foldath withdraws, dazzled with that beam of light, which came, as issuing from a cloud, to save the wounded chief. Growing in his pride he stands. He calls forth all his steel. As meet two broad-winged eagles, in their sounding strife, in winds, so rush the two chiefs on Moi-lena, into gloomy fight. By turns are the steps of the kings forward on their rocks above; for now the dusky war seems to descend on their swords. Cathmor feels the joy of warriors, on his mossy hill: their joy in secret, when dangers rise to match their souls. His eye is not turned on Lubar, but on Selma's dreadful king. He beholds him, on Mora, rising in his arms. Foldath falls on his shield. The spear of Fillan pierced the king. Nor looks the youth on the fallen, but onward rolls the war. The hundred voices of death arise. “Stay, son of Fingal, stay thy speed. Beholdest thou not that gleaming form, a dreadful sign of death? Awaken not the king of Erin. Return, son of blue-eyed Clatho.” Malthos beholds Foldath low. He darkly stands above the chief. Hatred is rolled from his soul. He seems a rock in the desert, on whose dark side are the trickling of waters; when the slow-sailing mist has left it, and all its trees are blasted with winds. He spoke to the dying hero, about the narrow house. “Whether shall thy grey stone rise in Ullin, or in Moma's woody land? where the sun looks, in secret, on the blue streams of Dalrutho? There are the steps of thy daughter, blue-eyed Dardu-lena!” “Rememberest thou her,” said Foldath, “because no son is mine: no youth to roll the battle before him, in revenge of me? Malthos, I am revenged. I was not peaceful in the field. Raise the tombs of those I have slain, around my narrow house. Often shall I forsake the blast, to rejoice above their graves; when I behold them spread around, with their long-whistling grass.” His soul rushed to the vale of Moma, to Dardu-lena's dreams, where she slept, by Dalrutho's stream, returning from the chace of the hinds. Her bow is near the maid, unstrung. The breezes fold her long hair on her breasts. Clothed in the beauty of youth, the love of heroes lay. Dark-bending from the skirts of the wood, her wounded father seemed to come. He appeared, at times, then hid himself in mist. Bursting in tears she rose. She knew that the chief was low. To her came a beam from his soul, when folded in its storms. Thou wert the last of his race, O blue-eyed Dardu-lena! Wide-spreading over echoing Lubar, the flight of Bolga is rolled along. Fillan hangs forward on their steps. He strews, with dead, the heath. Fingal rejoices over his son. Blue-shielded Cathmor rose. Son of Alpin, bring the harp. Give Fillan's praise to the wind. Raise high his praise in mine ear, while yet he shines in war. “Leave, blue-eyed Clatho, leave thy hall! Behold that early beam of thine! The host is withered in its course. No further look, it is dark. Light-trembling from the harp, strike, virgins, strike the sound. No hunter he descends, from the dewy haunt of the bounding roe. He bends not his bow on the wind; nor sends his grey arrow abroad. “Deep-folded in red war! See battle roll against his side. Striding amid the ridgy strife, he pours the deaths of thousands forth. Fillan is like a spirit of heaven, that descends from the skirt of winds. The troubled ocean feels his steps, as he strides from wave to wave. His path kindles behind him. Islands shake their heads on the heaving seas! Leave, blue-eyed Clatho, leave thy hall! BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. This book opens with a speech of Fingal, who sees Cathmor descending to the assistance of his flying army. The king dispatches Ossian to the relief of Fillan. He himself retires behind the rock of Cormul, to avoid the sight of the engagement between his son and Cathmor. Ossian advances. The descent of Cathmor described. He rallies the army, renews the battle, and, before Ossian could arrive, engages Fillan himself. Upon the approach of Ossian, the combat between the two heroes ceases. Ossian and Cathmor prepare to fight, but night coming on prevents them. Ossian returns to the place where Cathmor and Fillan fought. He finds Fillan mortally wounded, and leaning against a rock. Their discourse. Fillan dies: his body is laid, by Ossian, in a neighbouring cave. The Caledonian army return to Fingal. He questions them about his son, and, understanding that he was killed, retires, in silence, to the rock of Carmul. Upon the retreat of the army of Fingal, the Fir-bolg advance. Cathmor finds Bran, one of the dogs of Fingal, lying on the shield of Fillan, before the entrance of the cave, where the body of that hero lay. His reflections thereupon. He returns, in a melancholy mood, to his army. Malthos endeavours to comfort him, by the example of his father Borbar-duthal. Cathmor retires to rest. The song of Sul-malla concludes the book, which ends about the middle of the third night from the opening of the poem. Macpherson. Cathmor rises on his hill! Shall Fingal take the sword of Luno? But what shall become of thy fame, son of white-bosomed Clatho? Turn not thine eyes from Fingal, fair daughter of Inis-store. I shall not quench thy early beam. It shines along my soul. Rise, wood-skirted Mora, rise between the war and me! Why should Fingal behold the strife, lest his dark-daired warrior should fall! Amid the song, O Carril, pour the sound of the trembling harp! Here are the voices of rocks! and there the bright tumbling of waters. Father of Oscar, lift the spear! Defend the young in arms. Conceal thy steps from Fillan. He must not know that I doubt his steel. No cloud of mine shall rise, my son, upon thy soul of fire!” He sunk behind his rock, amid the sound of Carril's song. Brightening, in my growing soul, I took the spear of Temora. I saw, along Moilena, the wild tumbling of battle; the strife of death, in gleaming rows, disjoined and broken round. Fillan is a beam of fire. From wing to wing is his wasteful course. The ridges of war melt before him. They are rolled, in smoke, from the fields! Now is the coming forth of Cathmor, in the armour of kings! Dark waves the eagle's wing, above his helmet of fire. Unconcerned are his steps, as if they were to the chace of Erin. He raises, at times, his terrible voice. Erin, abashed, gathers round. Their souls return back like a stream. They wonder at the steps of their fear. He rose, like the beam of the morning, on a haunted heath: the traveller looks back, with bending eye, on the field of dreadful forms! Sudden, from the rock of Moi-lena, are Sul-malla's trembling steps. An oak takes the spear from her hand. Half-bent she looses the lance. But then are her eyes on the king, from amid her wandering locks! No friendly strife is before thee! No light contending of bows, as when the youth of Inis-huna come forth beneath the eye of Conmor! As the rock of Runo, which takes the passing clouds as they fly, seems growing, in gathered darkness, over the streamy heath; so seems the chief of Atha taller, as gather his people around. As different blasts fly over the sea, each behind its dark-blue wave; so Cathmor's words, on every side, pour his warriors forth. Nor silent on his hill is Fillan. He mixes his words with his echoing shield. An eagle he seemed, with sounding wings, calling the wind to his rock, when he sees the coming forth of the roes, on Lutha's rushy field! Now they bend forward in battle. Death's hundred voices arise. The kings, on either side, were like fires on the souls of the hosts. Ossian bounded along. High rocks and trees rush tall between the war and me. But I hear the noise of steel, between my clanging arms. Rising, gleaming, on the hill, I behold the backward steps of hosts: their backward steps, on either side, and wildly-looking eyes. The chiefs were met in dreadful fight! The two blue-shielded kings! Tall and dark, through gleams of steel, are seen the striving heroes! I rush. My fears for Fillan fly, burning across my soul. I come. Nor Cathmor flies; nor yet comes on; he sidelong stalks along. An icy rock, cold, tall he seems. I call forth all my steel. Silent awhile we stride, on either side of a rushing stream: then, sudden turning, all at once, we raise our pointed spears! We raise our spears; but night comes down. It is dark and silent round; but where the distant steps of hosts are sounding over the heath! I come to the place where Fillan fought. Nor voice, nor sound is there. A broken helmet lies on earth, a buckler cleft in twain. Where, Fillan, where art thou, young chief of echoing Morven? He hears me, leaning on a rock, which bends its grey head over the stream. He hears; but sullen, dark he stands. At length I saw the hero! “Why standest thou, robed in darkness, son of woody Selma? Bright is thy path, my brother, in this dark-brown field! Long has been thy strife in battle! Now the horn of Fingal is heard. Ascend to the cloud of thy father, to his hill of feasts. In the evening mist he sits, and hears the sound of Carril's harp. Carry joy to the aged, young breaker of the shields!” “Can the vanquished carry joy? Ossian, no shield is mine! It lies broken on the field. The eagle-wing of my helmet is torn. It is when foes fly before them, that fathers delight in their sons. But their sighs burst forth, in secret, when their young warriors yield. No: Fillan shall not behold the king! Why should the hero mourn?” “Son of blue-eyed Clatho! O Fillan, awake not my soul! Wert thou not a burning fire before him? Shall he not rejoice? Such fame belongs not to Ossian; yet is the king still a sun to me. He looks on my steps with joy. Shadows never rise on his face. Ascend, O Fillan, to Mora! His feast is spread in the folds of mist.” “Ossian! give me that broken shield: these feathers that are rolled in the wind. Place them near to Fillan, that less of his fame may fall. Ossian, I begin to fail. Lay me in that hollow rock. Raise no stone above, lest one should ask about my fame. I am fallen in the first of my fields; fallen without renown. Let thy voice alone send joy to my flying soul. Why should the bard know where dwells the lost beam of Clatho!” “Is thy spirit on the eddying winds, O Fillan, young breaker of shields! Joy pursue my hero through his folded clouds. The forms of thy fathers, O Fillan, bend to receive their son. I behold the spreading of their fire on Mora: the blue-rolling of their misty wreaths. Joy meet thee my brother! But we are dark and sad! I behold the foe round the aged. I behold the wasting away of his fame. Thou art left alone in the field, O grey-haired king of Selma!” I laid him in the hollow rock, at the roar of the nightly stream. One red star looked in on the hero. Winds lift, at times, his locks. I listen. No sound is heard. The warrior slept! As lightning on a cloud, a thought came rushing along my soul. My eyes roll in fire: my stride was in the clang of steel. “I will find thee, king of Erin! in the gathering of thy thousands find thee. Why should that cloud escape, that quenched our early beam? Kindle your meteors on your hills, my fathers. Light my daring steps. I will consume in wrath. But should not I return! The king is without a son, grey-haired among his foes! His arm is not as in the days of old. His fame grows dim in Erin. Let me not behold him laid low in his latter field. But can I return to the king? Will he not ask about his son? “Thou oughtest to defend young Fillan.” Ossian will meet the foe! Green Erin, thy sounding tread is pleasant to my ear. I rush on thy ridgy host, to shun the eyes of Fingal. I hear the voice of the king, on Mora's misty top! He calls his two sons! I come, my father, in my grief. I come like an eagle, which the flame of night met in the desert, and spoiled of half his wings!” Distant, round the king, on Mora, the broken ridges of Morven are rolled. They turned their eyes: each darkly bends, on his own ashen spear. Silent stood the king in the midst. Thought on thought rolled over his soul. As waves on a secret mountain-lake, each with its back of foam. He looked; no son appeared, with his long-beaming spear. The sighs arose, crowding, from his soul; but he concealed his grief. At length I stood beneath an oak. No voice of mine was heard. What could I say to Fingal in his hour of woe? His words rose, at length, in the midst: the people shrunk backward as he spoke. “Where is the son of Selma, he who led in war? I behold not his steps, among my people, returning from the field. Fell the young bounding roe, who was so stately on my hills? He fell; for ye are silent. The shield of war is cleft in twain. Let his armour be near to Fingal; and the sword of dark-brown Luno. I am waked on my hills; with morning I descend to war.” High on Cormul's rock, an oak is flaming to the wind. The grey skirts of mist are rolled around; thither strode the king in his wrath. Distant from the host he always lay, when battle burnt within his soul. On two spears hung his shield on high; the gleaming sign of death; that shield, which he was wont to strike, by night, before he rushed to war. It was then his warriors knew, when the king was to lead in strife; for never was this buckler heard till the wrath of Fingal arose. Unequal were his steps on high, as he shone in the beam of the oak; he was dreadful as the form of the spirit of night, when he clothes, on hills, his wild gestures with mist, and issuing forth, on the troubled ocean, mounts the car of winds. Nor settled, from the storm, is Erin's sea of war! they glitter, beneath the moon, and, low-humming, still roll on the field. Alone are the steps of Cathmor, before them on the heath; he hangs forward, with all his arms, on Morven's flying host. Now had he come to the mossy cave, where Fillan lay in night. One tree was bent above the stream, which glittered over the rock. There shone to the moon the broken shield of Clatho's son; and near it, on grass, lay hairy-footed Bran. He had missed the chief on Mora, and searched him along the wind. He thought that the blue-eyed hunter slept; he lay upon his shield. No blast came over the heath, unknown to bounding Bran. Cathmor saw the white-breasted dog; he saw the broken shield. Darkness is blown back on his soul; he remembers the falling away of the people. They come, a stream; are rolled away; another race succeeds. “But some mark the fields, as they pass, with their own mighty names. The heath, through dark-brown years, is theirs; some blue stream winds to their fame. Of these be the chief of Atha, when he lays him down on earth. Often may the voice of future times meet Cathmor in the air; when he strides from wind to wind, or folds himself in the wing of a storm.” Green Erin gathered round the king, to hear the voice of his power. Their joyful faces bend, unequal, forward, in the light of the oak. They who were terrible were removed: Lubar winds again in their host. Cathmor was that beam from heaven which shone when his people were dark. He was honoured in the midst. Their souls rose with ardour around. The king alone no gladness shewed; no stranger he to war! “Why is the king so sad,” said Malthos eagle-eyed? “Remains there a foe at Lubar? Lives there among them who can lift the spear? Not so peaceful was thy father, Borbar-duthul, king of spears. His rage was a fire that always burned: his joy over fallen foes was great. Three days feasted the grey-haired hero, when he heard that Calmar fell: Calmar, who aided the race of Ullin, from Lara of the streams. Often did he feel, with his hands, the steel which, they said, had pierced his foe. He felt it with his hands; for Borbar-duthul's eyes had failed. Yet was the king a sun to his friends; a gale to lift their branches round. Joy was around him in his halls: he loved the sons of Bolga. His name remains in Atha, like the awful memory of ghosts, whose presence was terrible; but they blew the storm away. Now let the voices of Erin raise the soul of the king; he that shone when war was dark, and laid the mighty low. Fonar, from that grey-browed rock, pour the tale of other times; pour it on the wide-skirted Erin, as it settles round.” “To me,” said Cathmor, “no song shall rise; nor Fonar sit on the rock of Lubar. The mighty there are laid low. Disturb not their rushing ghosts. Far, Malthos, far remove the sound of Erin's song. I rejoice not over the foe, when he ceases to lift the spear. With morning we pour our strength abroad. Fingal is wakened on his echoing hill.” Like waves, blown back by sudden winds, Erin retired at the voice of the king. Deep-rolled into the field of night, they spread their humming tribes. Beneath his own tree, at intervals, each bard sat down with his harp. They raised the song, and touched the string: each to the chief he loved. Before a burning oak Sul-malla touched, at times, the harp. She touched the harp, and heard, between, the breezes in her hair. In darkness near, lay the king of Atha, beneath an aged tree. The beam of the oak was turned from him; he saw the maid, but was not seen. His soul poured forth, in secret, when he beheld her fearful eye. “But battle is before thee, son of Borbar-duthul.” Amidst the harp, at intervals, she listened whether the warrior slept. Her soul was up; she longed, in secret, to pour her own sad song. The field is silent. On their wings, the blasts of night retire. The bards had ceased; and meteors came, red-winding with their ghosts. The sky grew dark; the forms of the dead were blended with the clouds. But heedless bends the daughter of Conmor, over the decaying flame. Thou wert alone in her soul, car-borne chief of Atha. She raised the voice of the song, and touched the harp between. “Clun-galo came; she missed the maid. Where art thou, beam of light? Hunters, from the mossy rock, saw ye the blue-eyed fair? Are her steps on grassy Lumon, near the bed of roes? Ah me! I behold her bow in the hall. Where art thou, beam of light?” “Cease, love of Conmor, cease; I hear thee not on the ridgy heath. My eye is turned to the king, whose path is terrible in war. He for whom my soul is up, in the season of my rest. Deep-bosomed in war he stands, he beholds me not from his cloud. Why, sun of Sul-malla, dost thou not look forth? I dwell in darkness here; wide over me flies the shadowy mist. Filled with dew are my locks: look thou from thy cloud, O sun of Sul-malla's soul.” ? BOOK VII. ARGUMENT. This book begins about the middle of the third night from the opening of the poem. The poet describes a kind of mist, which rose, by night, from the lake of Lego, and was the usual residence of the souls of the dead, during the interval between their decease and the funeral song. The appearance of the ghost of Fillan above the cave where his body lay. His voice comes to Fingal, on the rock of Cormul. The king strikes the shield of Trenmor, which was an infallible sign of his appearing in arms himself. The extraordinary effect of the sound of the shield. Sul-malla, starting from sleep, awakes Cathmor. Their affecting discourse. She insists with him to sue for peace; he resolves to continue the war. He directs her to retire to the neighbouring valley of Lona, which was the residence of an old Druid, until the battle of the next day should be over. He awakes his army with the sound of his shield. The shield described. Fonar, the bard, at the desire of Cathmor, relates the first settlement of the Fir-bolg in Ireland, under their leader Larthon. Morning comes. Sul-malla retires to the valley of Lona. A lyric song concludes the book. Macpherson. From the wood-skirted waters of Lego, ascend, at times, grey-bosomed mists; when the gates of the west are closed, on the sun's eagle-eye. Wide, over Lara's stream, is poured the vapour dark and deep: the moon, like a dim shield, is swimming through its folds. With this, clothe the spirits of old their sudden gestures on the wind, when they stride, from blast to blast, along the dusky night. Often, blended with the gale, to some warrior's grave, they roll the mist, a grey dwelling to his ghost, untill the songs arise. A sound came from the desert; it was Conar, king of Inis-fail. He poured his mist on the grave of Fillan, at blue-winding Lubar. Dark and mournful sat the ghost, in his grey ridge of smoke. The blast, at times, rolled him together: but the form returned again. It returned with bending eyes, and dark winding of locks of mist. It was dark. The sleeping host were still, in the skirts of night. The flame decayed, on the hill of Fingal; the king lay lonely on his shield. His eyes were half-closed in sleep, the voice of Fillan came. “Sleeps the husband of Clatho? Dwells the father of the fallen in rest? Am I forgot in the folds of darkness; lonely in the season of night!” “Why dost thou mix,” said the king, “with the dream of thy father? Can I forget thee, my son, or thy path of fire in the field! Not such come the deeds of the valiant on the soul of Fingal. They are not there a beam of lightning, which is seen, and is then no more. I remember thee, O Fillan, and my wrath begins to rise.” The king took his deathful spear, and struck the deep-sounding shield: his shield that hung high in night, the dismal sign of war! Ghosts fled on every side, and rolled their gathered forms on the wind. Thrice from the winding vale arose the voice of deaths. The harps of the bards, untouched, sound mournful over the hill. He struck again the shield; battles rose in the dreams of his host. The wide-tumbling strife is gleaming over their souls. Blue-shielded kings descend to war. Backward-looking armies fly; and mighty deeds are half-hid, in the bright gleams of steel. But when the third sound arose, deer started from the clefts of their rocks. The screams of fowl are heard, in the desert, as each flew, frighted on his blast. The sons of Selma half rose, and half assumed their spears. But silence rolled back on the host; they knew the shield of the king. Sleep returned to their eyes; the field was dark and still. No sleep was thine in darkness, blue-eyed daughter of Conmor! Sul-malla heard the dreadful shield, and rose, amid the night. Her steps are towards the king of Atha. “Can danger shake his daring soul!” In doubt she stands, with bending eyes. Heaven burns with all its stars. Again the shield resounds! She rushed. She stopt. Her voice half rose. It failed. She saw him, amidst his arms, that gleamed to heaven's fire. She saw him dim in his locks, that rose to nightly wind. Away, for fear, she turned her steps. “Why should the king of Erin awake? Thou art not a dream to his rest, daughter of Inis-huna.” More dreadful rings the shield. Sul-malla starts. Her helmet falls. Loud echoes Lubar's rock, as over it rolls the steel. Bursting from the dreams of night, Cathmor half rose, beneath his tree. He saw the form of the maid, above him, on the rock. A red star, with twinkling beam, looked through her floating hair. “Who comes through night to Cathmor, in the season of his dreams? Bringest thou aught of war? Who art thou, son of night? Standest thou before me, a form of the times of old? A voice from the fold of a cloud, to warn me of the danger of Erin?” “Nor lonely scout am I, nor voice from folded cloud,” she said; “but I warn thee of the danger of Erin. Dost thou hear that sound? It is not the feeble, king of Atha, that rolls his signs on night.” “Let the warrior roll his signs,” he replied; “to Cathmor they are the sounds of harps. My joy is great, voice of night, and burns over all my thought. This is the music of kings, on lonely hills, by night; when they light their daring souls, the sons of mighty deeds! The feeble dwell alone, in the valley of the breeze; where mists lift their morning skirts, from the blue-winding streams.” “Not feeble, king of men, were they, the fathers of my race. They dwelt in the folds of battle, in their distant lands. Yet delights not my soul, in the signs of death! He, who never yields, comes forth: O send the bard of peace!” Like a dropping rock, in the desert, stood Cathmor in his tears. Her voice came, a breeze, on his soul, and awaked the memory of her land; where she dwelt by her peaceful streams, before he came to the war of Conmor. “Daughter of strangers,” he said; (she trembling turned away) “long have I marked thee in thy steel, young pine of Inis-huna. But my soul, I said, is folded in a storm. Why should that beam arise, till my steps return in peace? Have I been pale in thy presence, as thou bidst me to fear the king? The time of danger, O maid, is the season of my soul; for then it swells, a mighty stream, and rolls me on the foe. “Beneath the moss-covered rock of Lona, near his own loud stream; grey in his locks of age, dwells Clonmal, king of harps. Above him is his echoing tree, and the dun bounding of roes. The noise of our strife reaches his ear, as he bends in the thoughts of years. There let thy rest be, Sul-malla, until our battle cease. Until I return, in my arms, from the skirts of the evening mist, that rises, on Lona, round the dwelling of my love.” A light fell on the soul of the maid; it rose kindled before the king. She turned her face to Cathmor, from amidst her waving locks. “Sooner shall the eagle of heaven be torn, from the stream of his roaring wind, when he sees the dun prey, before him, the young sons of the bounding roe, than thou, O Cathmor, be turned from the strife of renown. Soon may I see thee, warrior, from the skirts of the evening mist, when it is rolled around me, on Lona of the streams. While yet thou art distant far, strike, Cathmor, strike the shield, that joy may return to my darkened soul, as I lean on the mossy rock. But if thou shouldst fall, I am in the land of strangers; O send thy voice, from thy cloud, to the maid of Inis-huna.” “Young branch of green-headed Lumon, why dost thou shake in the storm? Often has Cathmor returned, from darkly-rolling wars. The darts of death are but hail to me; they have often rattled along my shield. I have risen brightened from battle, like a meteor from a stormy cloud. Return not, fair beam, from thy vale, when the roar of battle grows. Then might the foe escape, as from my fathers of old. “They told to Son-mor, of Clunar, who was slain by Cormac in fight. Three days darkened Son-mor over his brother's fall. His spouse beheld the silent king, and foresaw his steps to war. She prepared the bow, in secret, to attend her blue-shielded hero. To her dwelt darkness, at Atha, when he was not there. From their hundred streams, by night, poured down the sons of Alnecma. They had heard the shield of the king, and their rage arose. In clanging arms they moved along, towards Ullin of the groves. Son-mor struck his shield, at times, the leader of the war. “Far behind followed Sul-allin, over the streamy hills. She was a light on the mountain, when they crossed the vale below. Her steps were stately on the vale, when they rose on the mossy hill. She feared to approach the king, who left her in echoing Atha. But when the roar of battle rose; when host was rolled on host; when Son-mor burnt, like the fire of heaven in clouds, with her spreading hair came Sul-allin; for she trembled for her king. He stopt the rushing strife to save the love of heroes. The foe fled by night; Clunar slept without his blood; the blood which ought to be poured upon the warrior's tomb. “Nor rose the rage of Son-mor; but his days were silent and dark. Sul-allin wandered, by her grey streams, with her tearful eyes. Often did she look, on the hero, when he was folded in his thoughts. But she shrunk from his eyes, and turned her lone steps away. Battles rose, like a tempest, and drove the mist from his soul. He beheld, with joy, her steps in the hall, and the white rising of her hands on the harp.” In his arms strode the chief of Atha, to where his shield hung, high, in night: high on a mossy bough, over Lubar's streamy roar. Seven bosses rose on the shield; the seven voices of the king, which his warriors received, from the wind, and marked over all their tribes. On each boss is placed a star of night; Canmathon with beams unshorn; Col-derna rising from a cloud: Uloicho robed in mist; and the soft beam of Cathling glittering on a rock. Smiling, on its own blue wave, Reldurath half sinks its western light. The red eye of Berthin looks, through a grove, on the hunter, as he returns, by night, with the spoils of the bounding roe. Wide, in the mist, arose the cloudless beams of Ton-théna, that star which looked, by night, on the course of the sea-tossed Larthon: Larthon, the first of Bolga's race, who travelled on the winds. White-bosomed spread the sails of the king, towards streamy Inis-fail; dun night was rolled before him, with its skirts of mist. Unconstant blew the winds, and rolled him from wave to wave. Then rose the fiery-haired Ton-théna, and smiled from her parted cloud. Larthon blessed the well-known beam, as it faint-gleamed on the deep. Beneath the spear of Cathmor, rose that voice which awakes the bards. They came, dark-winding, from every side; each with the sound of his harp. Before them rejoiced the king, as the traveller, in the day of the sun; when he hears, far-rolling around, the murmur of mossy streams; streams that burst, in the desert, from the rock of roes. “Why,” said Fonar, “hear we the voice of the king, in the season of his rest? Were the dim forms of thy fathers bending in thy dreams? Perhaps they stand on that cloud, and wait for Fonar's song; often they come to the fields where their sons are to lift the spear. Or shall our voice arise for him who lifts the spear no more; he that consumed the field, from Moma of the groves?” “Not forgot is that cloud in war, bard of other times. High shall his tomb rise, on Moilena, the dwelling of renown. But now, roll back my soul to the times of my fathers; to the years when first they rose, on Inis-huna's waves. Nor alone pleasant to Cathmor is the remembrance of wood-covered Lumon. Lumon of the streams, the dwelling of white-bosomed maids. “Lumon of the streams, thou risest on Fonar's soul! Thy sun is on thy side, on the rocks of thy bending trees. The dun roe is seen from thy furze; the deer lifts his branchy head; for he sees, at times, the hound on the half-covered heath. Slow, on the vale, are the steps of maids; the white-armed daughters of the bow: they lift their blue eyes to the hill, from amidst their wandering locks. Not there is the stride of Larthon, chief of Inis-huna. He mounts the wave on his own dark oak, in Cluba's ridgy bay. That oak which he cut from Lumon, to bound along the sea. The maids turn their eyes away, lest the king should be lowly-laid; for never had they seen a ship, dark rider of the wave! “Now he dares to call the winds, and to mix with the mist of ocean. Blue Inis-fail rose, in smoke; but dark-skirted night came down. The sons of Bolga feared. The fiery-haired Ton-théna rose. Culbin's bay received the ship, in the bosom of its echoing woods. There, issued a stream, from Duthuma's horrid cave; where spirits gleamed, at times, with their half-finished forms. “Dreams descended on Larthon: he saw seven spirits of his fathers. He heard their half-formed words, and dimly beheld the times to come. He beheld the kings of Atha, the sons of future days. They led their hosts, along the field, like ridges of mist, which winds pour, in autumn, over Atha of the groves. “Larthon raised the hall of Samla, to the music of the harp. He went forth to the roes of Erin, to their wonted streams. Nor did he forget green-headed Lumon; he often bounded over his seas, to where white-handed Flathal looked from the hill of roes. Lumon of the foamy streams, thou risest on Fonar's soul!” Morning pours from the east. The misty heads of the mountains rise. Vallies shew, on every side, the grey-winding of their streams. His host heard the shield of Cathmor: at once they rose around; like a crowded sea, when first it feels the wings of the wind. The waves know not whither to roll; they lift their troubled heads. Sad and slow retired Sul-malla to Lona of the streams. She went, and often turned; her blue eyes rolled in tears. But when she came to the rock, that darkly-covered Lona's vale, she looked, from her bursting soul, on the king; and sunk, at once, behind. Son of Alpin, strike the string. Is there aught of joy in the harp? Pour it then on the soul of Ossian: it is folded in mist. I hear thee, O bard, in my night. But cease the lightly-trembling sound. The joy of grief belongs to Ossian, amidst his dark-brown years. Green thorn of the hill of ghosts, that shakest thy head to nightly winds! I hear no sound in thee; is there no spirit's windy skirt now rustling in thy leaves? Often are the steps of the dead, in the dark-eddying blasts; when the moon, a dun shield, from the east, is rolled along the sky. Ullin, Carril, and Ryno, voices of the days of old! Let me hear you, while yet it is dark, to please and awake my soul. I hear you not, ye sons of song; in what hall of the clouds is your rest? Do you touch the shadowy harp, robed with morning mist, where the rustling sun comes forth from his green-headed waves? BOOK VIII. ARGUMENT. The fourth morning, from the opening of the poem, comes on. Fingal, still continuing in the place to which he had retired on the preceding night, is seen, at intervals, through the mist which covered the rock of Cormul. The descent of the king is described. He orders Gaul, Dermid, and Carril the bard, to go to the valley of Cluna, and conduct from thence, to the Caledonian army, Ferad-artho, the son of Cairbre, the only person remaining of the family of Conor, the first king of Ireland. The king takes the command of the army, and prepares for battle. Marching towards the enemy, he comes to the cave of Lubar, where the body of Fillan lay. Upon seeing his dog Bran, who lay at the entrance of the cave, his grief returns. Cathmor arranges the Irish army in order of battle. The appearance of that hero. The general conflict is described. The actions of Fingal and Cathmor. A storm. The total rout of the Firbolg. The two kings engage, in a column of mist, on the banks of Lubar. Their attitude and conference after the combat. The death of Cathmor. Fingal resigns the spear of Trenmor to Ossian. The ceremonies observed on that occasion. The spirit of Cathmor, in the mean time, appears to Sul-malla, in the valley of Lona. Her sorrow. Evening comes on. A feast is prepared. The coming of Ferad artho is announced by the songs of a hundred bards. The poem closes with a speech of Fingal. Macpherson. As when the wintry winds have seized the waves of the mountain-lake, have seized them, in stormy night, and clothed them over with ice; white, to the hunter's early eye, the billows still seem to roll. He turns his ear to the sound of each unequal ridge. But each is silent, gleaming, strewn with boughs and tufts of grass, which shake and whistle to the wind, over their grey seats of frost. So silent shone to the morning the ridges of Morven's host, as each warrior looked up from his helmet towards the hill of the king; the cloud-covered hill of Fingal, where he strode, in the folds of mist. At times is the hero seen, greatly dim in all his arms. From thought to thought rolled the war, along his mighty soul. Now is the coming forth of the king. First appeared the sword of Luno; the spear half issuing from a cloud, the shield still dim in mist. But when the stride of the king came abroad, with all his grey, dewy locks in the wind; then rose the shouts of his host over every moving tribe. They gathered, gleaming, round, with all their echoing shields. So rise the green seas round a spirit, that comes down from the squally wind. The traveller hears the sound afar, and lifts his head over the rock. He looks on the troubled bay, and thinks he dimly sees the form. The waves sport, unwieldy, round, with all their backs of foam. Far-distant stood the son of Morni, Duthno's race, and Cona's bard. We stood far-distant; each beneath his tree. We shunned the eyes of the king; we had not conquered in the field. A little stream rolled at my feet: I touched its light wave, with my spear. I touched it with my spear; nor there was the soul of Ossian. It darkly rose, from thought to thought, and sent abroad the sigh. “Son of Morni,” said the king, “Dermid, hunter of roes! why are ye dark, like two rocks, each with its trickling waters? No wrath gathers on Fingal's soul, against the chiefs of men. Ye are my strength in battle; the kindling of my joy in peace. My early voice has been a pleasant gale to your ears, when Fillan prepared the bow. The son of Fingal is not here, nor yet the chace of the bounding roes. But why should the breakers of shields stand, darkened, far away?” Tall they strode towards the king: they saw him turned to Mora's wind. His tears came down, for his blue-eyed son, who slept in the cave of streams. But he brightened before them, and spoke to the broad-shielded kings. “Crommal, with woody rocks, and misty top, the field of winds, pours forth, to the sight, blue Lubar's streamy roar. Behind it rolls clear-winding Lavath, in the still vale of deer. A cave is dark in a rock; above it strong-winged eagles dwell; broad-headed oaks, before it sound in Cluna's wind. Within, in his locks of youth, is Ferad-artho, blue-eyed king, the son of broad-shielded Cairbar, from Ullin of the roes. He listens to the voice of Condan, as, grey, he bends in feeble light. He listens; for his foes dwell in the echoing halls of Temora. He comes, at times, abroad, in the skirts of mist, to pierce the bounding roes. When the sun looks on the field, nor by the rock, nor stream, is he! He shuns the race of Bolga, who dwell in his father's hall. Tell him, that Fingal lifts the spear, and that his foes, perhaps, may fail. “Lift up, O Gaul, the shield before him. Stretch, Dermid, Temora's spear. Be thy voice in his ear, O Carril, with the deeds of his fathers. Lead him to green Moi-lena, to the dusky field of ghosts; for there, I fall forward, in battle, in the folds of war. Before dun night descends, come to high Dunmora's top. Look, from the grey skirts of mist, on Lena of the streams. If there my standard shall float on wind, over Lubar's gleaming stream, then has not Fingal failed in the last of his fields.” Such were his words; nor aught replied the silent striding kings. They looked, side-long, on Erin's host, and darkened, as they went. Never before had they left the king, in the midst of the stormy field. Behind them, touching at times his harp, the grey-haired Carril moved. He foresaw the fall of the people, and mournful was the sound! It was like a breeze that comes, by fits, over Lego's reedy lake; when sleep half-descends on the hunter, within his mossy cave. “Why bends the bard of Cona,” said Fingal, “over his secret stream? Is this a time for sorrow, father of low-laid Oscar? Be the warriors remembered in peace; when echoing shields are heard no more. Bend, then, in grief, over the flood, where blows the mountain breeze. Let them pass on thy soul, the blue-eyed dwellers of the tomb. But Erin rolls to war; wide-tumbling, rough, and dark. Lift, Ossian, lift the shield. I am alone, my son!” As comes the sudden voice of winds to the becalmed ship of Inis-huna, and drives it large, along the deep, dark rider of the wave; so the voice of Fingal sent Ossian, tall, along the heath. He lifted high his shining shield, in the dusky wing of war: like the broad, blank moon, in the skirt of a cloud, before the storms arise. Loud, from moss-covered Mora, poured down at once the broad-winged war. Fingal led his people forth, king of Morven of streams. On high spreads the eagle's wing. His grey hair is poured on his shoulders broad. In thunder are his mighty strides. He often stood, and saw behind, the wide-gleaming rolling of armour. A rock he seemed, grey over with ice, whose woods are high in wind. Bright streams leap from its head, and spread their foam on blasts. Now he came to Lubar's cave, where Fillan darkly slept. Bran still lay on the broken shield: the eagle-wing is strewed by the winds. Bright, from withered furze, looked forth the hero's spear. Then grief stirred the soul of the king, like whirlwinds blackening on a lake. He turned his sudden step, and leaned on his bending spear. White-breasted Bran came bounding with joy to the known path of Fingal. He came, and looked towards the cave, where the blue-eyed hunter lay, for he was wont to stride, with morning, to the dewy bed of the roe. It was then the tears of the king came down, and all his soul was dark. But as the rising wind rolls away the storm of rain, and leaves the white streams to the sun, and high hills with their heads of grass: so the returning war brightened the mind of Fingal. He bounded, on his spear, over Lubar, and struck his echoing shield. His ridgy host bend forward, at once, with all their pointed steel. Nor Erin heard, with fear, the sound: wide they came rolling along. Dark Malthos, in the wing of war, looks forward from shaggy brows. Next rose that beam of light Hidalla; then the side-long-looking gloom of Maronnan. Blue-shielded Clonar lifts the spear; Cormar shakes his bushy locks on the wind. Slowly, from behind a rock, rose the bright form of Atha. First appeared his two pointed spears, then the half of his burnished shield: like the rising of a nightly meteor, over the vale of ghosts. But when he shone all abroad: the hosts plunged, at once, into strife. The gleaming waves of steel are poured on either side. As meet two troubled seas, with the rolling of all their waves, when they feel the wings of contending winds, in the rock-sided firth of Lumon; along the echoing hills is the dim course of ghosts: from the blast fall the torn groves on the deep, amidst the foamy path of whales. So mixed the hosts! Now Fingal; now Cathmor came abroad. The dark tumbling of death is before them: the gleam of broken steel is rolled on their steps, as, loud, the high-bounding kings hewed down the ridge of shields. Maronnan fell, by Fingal, laid large across a stream. The waters gathered by his side, and leapt grey over his bossy shield. Clonar is pierced by Cathmor: nor yet lay the chief on earth. An oak seized his hair in his fall. His helmet rolled on the ground. By its thong, hung his broad shield; over it wandered his streaming blood. Tla-min shall weep, in the hall, and strike her heaving breast. Nor did Ossian forget the spear, in the wing of his war. He strewed the field with dead. Young Hidalla came. “Soft voice of streamy Clonra! Why dost thou lift the steel? O that we met, in the strife of song, in thy own rushy vale!” Malthos beheld him low, and darkened as he rushed along. On either side of a stream, we bend in the echoing strife. Heaven comes rolling down: around burst the voices of squally winds. Hills are clothed, at times, in fire. Thunder rolls in wreaths of mist. In darkness shrunk the foe: Morven's warriors stood aghast. Still I bent over the stream, amidst my whistling locks. Then rose the voice of Fingal, and the sound of the flying foe. I saw the king, at times, in lightning, darkly-striding in his might. I struck my echoing shield, and hung forward on the steps of Alnecma: the foe is rolled before me, like a wreath of smoke. The sun looked forth from his cloud. The hundred streams of Moi-lena shone. Slow rose the blue columns of mist, against the glittering hill. “Where are the mighty kings? Nor by that stream, nor wood, are they! I hear the clang of arms! Their strife is in the bosom of that mist. Such is the contending of spirits in a nightly cloud, when they strive for the wintry wings of wind, and the rolling of the foam-covered waves. I rushed along. The grey mist rose. Tall, gleaming, they stood at Lubar. Cathmor leaned against a rock. His half-fallen shield received the stream, that leapt from the moss above. Towards him is the stride of Fingal: he saw the hero's blood. His sword fell slowly to his side. He spoke, midst his darkening joy. “Yields the race of Borbar-duthul? Or still does he lift the spear? Not unheard is thy name, at Atha, in the green dwelling of strangers. It has come, like the breeze of his desert, to the ear of Fingal. Come to my hill of feasts: the mighty fail, at times. No fire am I to low-laid foes: I rejoice not over the fall of the brave. To close the wound is mine: I have known the herbs of the hills. I seized their fair heads, on high, as they waved by their secret streams. Thou art dark and silent, king of Atha of strangers. “By Atha of the stream,” he said, “there rises a mossy rock. On its head is the wandering of boughs, within the course of winds. Dark, in its face, is a cave with its own loud rill. There have I heard the tread of strangers, when they passed to my hall of shells. Joy rose, like a flame, on my soul: I blest the echoing rock. Here be my dwelling, in darkness; in my grassy vale. From this I shall mount the breeze, that pursues my thistle's beard; or look down, on blue-winding Atha, from its wandering mist.” “Why speaks the king of the tomb? Ossian! the warrior has failed! Joy meet thy soul, like a stream, Cathmor, friend of strangers! My son, I hear the call of years; they take my spear as they pass along. Why does not Fingal, they seem to say, rest within his hall? Dost thou always delight in blood? In the tear of the sad? No: ye dark-rolling years, Fingal delights not in blood. Tears are wintry streams that waste away my soul. But, when I lie down to rest, then comes the mighty voice of war. It awakes me, in my hall, and calls forth all my steel. It shall call forth no more; Ossian, take thou thy father's spear. Lift it, in battle, when the proud arise. “My fathers, Ossian, trace my steps; my deeds are pleasant to their eyes. Wherever I come forth to battle, on my field, are their columns of mist. But mine arm rescued the feeble; the haughty found my rage was fire. Never over the fallen did mine eye rejoice. For this, my fathers shall meet me, at the gates of their airy halls, tall, with robes of light, with mildly-kindled eyes. But, to the proud in arms, they are darkened moons in heaven, which send the fire of night, red-wandering over their face. “Father of heroes, Trenmor, dweller of eddying winds! I give thy spear to Ossian, let thine eye rejoice. Thee have I seen, at times, bright from between thy clouds; so appear to my son, when he is to lift the spear: then shall he remember thy mighty deeds, though thou art now but a blast.” He gave the spear to my hand, and raised at once a stone on high, to speak to future times, with its grey head of moss. Beneath he placed a sword in earth, and one bright boss from his shield. Dark in thought, a-while, he bends: his words, at length, came forth. “When thou, O stone, shalt moulder down, and lose thee, in the moss of years, then shall the traveller come, and, whistling, pass away. Thou knowest not, feeble man, that fame once shone on Moi-lena. Here Fingal resigned his spear, after the last of his fields. Pass away, thou empty shade; in thy voice there is no renown. Thou dwellest by some peaceful stream; yet a few years, and thou art gone. No one remembers thee, thou dweller of thick mist! But Fingal shall be clothed with fame, a beam of light to other times; for he went forth, in echoing steel, to save the weak in arms.” Brightening in his fame, the king strode to Lubar's sounding oak, where it bent, from its rock, over the bright-tumbling stream. Beneath it is a narrow plain, and the sound of the fount of the rock. Here the standard of Morven poured its wreaths on the wind, to mark the way of Ferad-artho, from his secret vale. Bright, from his parted west, the sun of heaven looked abroad. The hero saw his people, and heard their shouts of joy. In broken ridges round, they glittered to the beam. The king rejoiced, as a hunter in his own green vale, when, after the storm is rolled away, he sees the gleaming sides of the rocks. The green thorn shakes its head in their face; from their top look forward the roes. Grey, at his mossy cave, is bent the aged form of Clonmal. The eyes of the bard had failed. He leaned forward, on his staff. Bright, in her locks, before him, Sul-malla listened to the tale; the tale of the kings of Atha, in the days of old. The noise of battle had ceased in his ear: he stopt, and raised the secret sigh. The spirits of the dead, they said, often lightened along his soul. He saw the king of Atha low, beneath his bending tree. “Why art thou dark,” said the maid? “The strife of arms is past. Soon shall he come to thy cave, over thy winding streams. The sun looks from the rocks of the west. The mists of the lake arise. Grey, they spread on that hill, the rushy dwelling of roes. From the mist shall my king appear! Behold he comes in his arms. Come to the cave of Clonmal, O my best beloved!” It was the spirit of Cathmor, stalking, large, a gleaming form. He sunk by the hollow stream that roared between the hills. “It was but the hunter,” she said, “who searches for the bed of the roe. His steps are not forth to war; his spouse expects him with night. He shall, whistling, return with the spoils of the dark-brown hinds.” Her eyes were turned to the hill; again the stately form came down. She rose, in the midst of joy. He retired again in mist. Gradual vanish his limbs of smoke, and mix with the mountain-wind. Then she knew that he fell! “King of Erin, art thou low!” Let Ossian forget her grief; it wastes the soul of age. Evening came down on Moi-lena. Grey rolled the streams of the land. Loud came forth the voice of Fingal: the beam of oaks arose. The people gathered round with gladness; with gladness blended with shades. They sidelong looked to the king, and beheld his unfinished joy. Pleasant, from the way of the desert, the voice of music came. It seemed, at first, the noise of a stream far-distant on its rocks. Slow it rolled along the hill, like the ruffled wing of a breeze, when it takes the tufted beard of the rocks, in the still season of night. It was the voice of Condan, mixed with Carril's trembling harp. They came, with blue-eyed Ferad-artho, to Mora of the streams. Sudden bursts the song from our bards, on Lena: the host struck their shields midst the sound. Gladness rose brightening on the king, like the beam of a cloudy day, when it rises, on the green hill, before the roar of winds. He struck the bossy shield of kings; at once they cease around. The people lean forward, from their spears, towards the voice of their land. “Sons of Morven, spread the feast; send the night away in song. Ye have shone around me, and the dark storm is past. My people are the windy rocks, from which I spread my eagle-wings, when I rush forth to renown, and seize it on its field. Ossian, thou hast the spear of Fingal: it is not the staff of a boy, with which he strews the thistle round, young wanderer of the field. No: it is the lance of the mighty, with which they stretched forth their hands to death. Look to thy fathers, my son; they are awful beams. With morning lead Ferad-artho forth to the echoing halls of Temora. Remind him of the kings of Erin; the stately forms of old. Let not the fallen be forgot, they were mighty in the field. Let Carril pour his song, that the kings may rejoice in their mist. To-morrow I spread my sails to Selma's shaded walls; where streamy Duthula winds through the seats of roes.” CATHLIN OF CLUTHA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. An address to Malvina, the daughter of Toscar. The poet relates the arrival of Cathlin in Selma, to solicit aid against Duth-carmor of Cluba, who had killed Cathmol, for the sake of his daughter Lanul. Fingal declining to make a choice among his heroes, who were all claiming the command of the expedition; they retired each to his hill of ghosts; to be determined by dreams. The spirit of Trenmor appears to Ossian and Oscar: they sail from the bay of Carmona, and, on the fourth day, appear off the valley of Rathcol, in Inis-huna, where Duth-carmor had fixed his residence. Ossian dispatches a bard to Duth-carmor to demand battle. Night comes on. The distress of Cathlin of Clutha. Ossian devolves the command on Oscar, who, according to the custom of the kings of Morven, before battle, retired to a neighbouring hill. Upon the coming on of day, the battle joins. Oscar and Duth-carmor meet. The latter falls. Oscar carries the mail and helmet of Duth-carmor to Cathlin, who had retired from the field. Cathlin is discovered to be the daughter of Cathmol, in disguise, who had been carried off, by force, by, and had made her escape from, Duth-carmor. Macpherson. The traditions which accompany this poem inform us, that it went, of old, under the name of Laoi-Oi-lutha; i. e. the hymn of the maid of Lutha. They pretend also to fix the time of its composition, to the third year after the death of Fingal; that is, during the expedition of Fergus the son of Fingal, to the banks of Uisca-duthon. In support of this opinion, the Highland senachies have prefixed to this poem, an address of Ossian, to Congal the young son of Fergus, which I have rejected, as having no manner of connection with the rest of the piece. It has poetical merit; and, probably, it was the opening of one of Ossian's other poems, though the bards injudiciously transferred it to the piece now before us. “Congal, son of Fergus of Durath, thou light between thy locks, ascend to the rock of Selma, to the oak of the breaker of shields. Look over the bosom of night, it is streaked with the red paths of the dead: look on the night of ghosts, and kindle, O Congal, thy soul. Be not, like the moon on a stream, lonely in the midst of clouds: darkness closes around it; and the beam departs. Depart not, son of Fergus, ere thou markest the field with thy sword. Ascend to the rock of Selma; to the oak of the breaker of shields.” Macpherson. Come, thou beam that art lonely Come, thou beam that art lonely, from watching in the night! The squally winds are around thee, from all their echoing hills. Red, over my hundred streams, are the light-covered paths of the dead. They rejoice, on the eddying winds, in the still season of night. Dwells there no joy in song, white hand of the harps of Lutha? Awake the voice of the string; and roll my soul to me. It is a stream that has failed. Malvina, pour the song. I hear thee, from thy darkness, in Selma, thou that watchest, lonely, by night! Why didst thou with-hold the song, from Ossian's failing soul? As the falling brook to the ear of the hunter, descending from his storm-covered hill; in a sun-beam rolls the echoing stream; he hears, and shakes his dewy locks: such is the voice of Lutha, to the friend of the spirits of heroes. My swelling bosom beats high. I look back on the days that are past. Come, thou beam that art lonely, from watching in the night! In the echoing bay of Carmona, we saw, one day, the bounding ship. On high, hung a broken shield; it was marked with wandering blood. Forward came a youth, in arms, and stretched his pointless spear. Long, over his tearful eyes, hung loose his disordered locks. Fingal gave the shell of kings. The words of the stranger arose. “In his hall lies Cathmol of Clutha, by the winding of his own dark streams. Duth-carmor saw white-bosomed Lanul, and pierced her father's side. In the rushy desert were my steps. He fled in the season of night. Give thine aid to Cathlin to revenge his father. I sought thee not as a beam, in a land of clouds. Thou, like the sun, art known, king of echoing Selma!” Selma's king looked around. In his presence we rose in arms. But who should lift the shield? for all had claimed the war. The night came down; we strode, in silence; each to his hill of ghosts: that spirits might descend, in our dreams, to mark us for the field. We struck the shield of the dead; we raised the hum of songs. We thrice called the ghosts of our fathers. We laid us down in dreams. Trenmor came, before mine eyes, the tall form of other years! His blue hosts were behind him in half-extinguished rows. Scarce seen is their strife in mist, or their stretching forward to deaths. I listened; but no sound was there. The forms were empty wind! I started from the dream of ghosts. On a sudden blast flew my whistling hair. Low-sounding, in the oak, is the departure of the dead. I took my shield from its bough. Onward came the rattling of steel. It was Oscar of Lego. He had seen his fathers. “As rushes forth the blast, on the bosom of whitening waves; so careless shall my course be, through ocean, to the dwelling of foes. I have seen the dead, my father! My beating soul is high! My fame is bright before me, like the streak of light on a cloud, when the broad sun comes forth, red traveller of the sky!” “Grandson of Branno,” I said; “not Oscar alone shall meet the foe. I rush forward, through ocean, to the woody dwelling of heroes. Let us contend, my son, like eagles, from one rock; when they lift their broad wings, against the stream of winds.” We raised our sails in Carmona. From three ships, they marked my shield on the wave, as I looked on nightly Tonthena, red traveller between the clouds. Four days came the breeze abroad. Lumon came forward in mist. In winds were its hundred groves. Sunbeams marked, at times, its brown side. White, leapt the foamy streams, from all its echoing rocks. A green field, in the bosom of hills, winds silent with its own blue stream. Here, midst the waving of oaks, were the dwellings of kings of old. But silence, for many dark-brown years, had settled in grassy Rath-col; for the race of heroes had failed, along the pleasant vale. Duth-carmor was here, with his people, dark rider of the wave. Ton-thena had hid her head in the sky. He bound his white-bosomed sails. His course is on the hills of Rath-col, to the seats of roes. We came. I sent the bard, with songs, to call the foe to fight. Duth-carmor heard him, with joy. The king's soul was a beam of fire; a beam of fire, marked with smoke, rushing, varied, through the bosom of night. The deeds of Duth-carmor were dark, though his arm was strong. Night came, with the gathering of clouds. By the beam of the oak we sat down. At a distance stood Cathlin of Clutha. I saw the changeful soul of the stranger. As shadows fly over the field of grass; so various is Cathlin's cheek. It was fair, within locks, that rose on Rath-col's wind. I did not rush, amidst his soul, with my words. I bade the song to rise. “Oscar of Lego,” I said, “be thine the secret hill to-night. Strike the shield, like Morven's kings. With day, thou shalt lead in war. From my rock I shall see thee, Oscar, a dreadful form ascending in fight, like the appearance of ghosts, amidst the storms they raise. Why should mine eyes return to the dim times of old, ere yet the song had bursted forth, like the sudden rising of winds? But the years, that are past, are marked with mighty deeds. As the nightly rider of waves looks up to Tonthena of beams; so let us turn our eyes to Trenmor, the father of kings. “Wide, in Caracha's echoing field, Carmal had poured his tribes. They were a dark ridge of waves. The grey-haired bards were like moving foam on their face. They kindled the strife around, with their red-rolling eyes. Nor alone were the dwellers of rocks; a son of Loda was there; a voice, in his own dark land, to call the ghosts from high. On his hill, he had dwelt, in Lochlin, in the midst of a leafless grove. Five stones lifted, near, their heads. Loud roared his rushing stream. He often raised his voice to the winds, when meteors marked their nightly wings; when the dark-robed moon was rolled behind her hill. Nor unheard of ghosts was he! They came with the sound of eagle wings. They turned battle, in fields, before the kings of men. “But, Trenmor, they turned not from battle. He drew forward the troubled war; in its dark skirt was Trathal, like a rising light. It was dark; and Loda's son poured forth his signs, on night. The feeble were not before thee, son of other lands! Then rose the strife of kings about the hill of night; but it was soft as two summer gales, shaking their light wings, on a lake. Trenmor yielded to his son; for the fame of the king had been heard. Trathal came forth before his fame, and the foes failed, in echoing Caracha. The years that are past, my son, are marked with mighty deeds.” In clouds rose the eastern light. The foe came forth in arms. The strife is mixed on Rath-col, like the roar of streams. Behold the contending of kings! They meet before the oak. In gleams of steel the dark forms are lost; such is the meeting of meteors, in a vale by night: red light is scattered round, and men foresee the storm! Duth-carmor is low in blood! The son of Ossian overcame! Not harmless in battle was he, Malvina, hand of harps! Nor, in the field, were the steps of Cathlin. The stranger stood by a secret stream, where the foam of Rath-col skirted the mossy stones. Above, bends the branchy birch, and strews its leaves, on wind. The inverted spear of Cathlin touched, at times, the stream. Oscar brought Duth-carmor's mail: his helmet with its eagle-wing. He placed them before the stranger, and his words were heard. “The foes of thy father have failed. They are laid in the field of ghosts. Renown returns to Morven, like a rising wind. Why art thou dark, chief of Clutha! Is there cause for grief? “Son of Ossian of harps, my soul is darkly sad. I behold the arms of Cathmol, which he raised in war. Take the mail of Cathlin, place it high in Selma's hall, that thou mayst remember the hapless in thy distant land.” From white breasts descended the mail. It was the race of kings; the soft-handed daughter of Cathmol, at the streams of Clutha! Duth-carmor saw her bright in the hall; he had come, by night, to Clutha. Cathmol met him, in battle, but the hero fell. Three days dwelt the foe with the maid. On the fourth she fled in arms. She remembered the race of kings, and felt her bursting soul! Why, maid of Toscar of Lutha, should I tell how Cathlin failed? Her tomb is at rushy Lumon, in a distant land. Near it were the steps of Sul-malla, in the days of grief. She raised the song, for the daughter of strangers, and touched the mournful harp. Come, from the watching of night, Malvina, lonely beam! SULMALLA OF LUMON: A POEM. ARGUMENT. This poem, which, properly speaking, is a continuation of the last, opens with an address to Sul-malla, the daughter of the king of Inis-huna, whom Ossian met at the chace, as he returned from the battle of Rath-col. Sul-malla invites Ossian and Oscar to a feast, at the residence of her father, who was then absent in the wars. Upon hearing their name and family, she relates an expedition of Fingal into Inis-huna. She casually mentioning Cathmor, chief of Atha (who then assisted her father against his enemies), Ossian introduces the episode of Culgorm and Surandronlo, two Scandinavian kings, in whose wars Ossian himself and Cathmor were engaged on opposite sides. The story is imperfect, a part of the original being lost. Ossian, warned in a dream by the ghost of Trenmor, sets sail from Inis-huna. Macpherson. Who moves so stately, on Lumon Who moves so stately, on Lumon, at the roar of the foamy waters? Her hair falls upon her heaving breast. White is her arm behind, as slow she bends the bow. Why dost thou wander in deserts, like a light through a cloudy field? The young roes are panting, by their secret rocks. Return, thou daughter of kings! the cloudy night is near! It was the young branch of green Inis-huna, Sul-malla of blue eyes. She sent the bard from her rock, to bid us to her feast. Amidst the song we sat down, in Cluba's echoing hall. White moved the hands of Sul-malla, on the trembling strings. Half-heard amidst the sound, was the name of Atha's king: he that was absent in battle for her own green land. Nor absent from her soul was he; he came midst her thoughts by night. Tonthena looked in, from the sky, and saw her tossing arms. The sound of shells had ceased. Amidst long locks, Sul-malla rose. She spoke with bended eyes, and asked of our course through seas; “for of the kings of men are ye, tall riders of the wave.” “Not unknown,” I said, “at his streams is he, the father of our race. Fingal has been heard of at Cluba. blue-eyed daughter of kings. Nor only, at Cona's stream, is Ossian and Oscar known. Foes trembled at our voice, and shrunk in other lands.” “Not unmarked,” said the maid, “by Sul-malla, is the shield of Morven's king. It hangs high, in my father's hall, in memory of the past; when Fingal came to Cluba, in the days of other years. Loud roared the boar of Culdarnu, in the midst of his rocks and woods. Inis-huna sent her youths, but they failed; and virgins wept over tombs. Careless went Fingal to Culdarnu. On his spear rolled the strength of the woods. He was bright, they said, in his locks, the first of mortal men. Nor at the feast were heard his words. His deeds passed from his soul of fire, like the rolling of vapours from the face of the wandering sun. Not careless looked the blue eyes of Cluba on his stately steps. In white bosoms rose the king of Selma, in the midst of their thoughts by night. But the winds bore the stranger to the echoing vales of his roes. Nor lost to other lands was he, like a meteor that sinks in a cloud. He came forth, at times, in his brightness, to the distant dwelling of foes. His fame came, like the sound of winds, to Cluba's woody vale.” “Darkness dwells in Cluba of harps: the race of kings is distant far; in battle is my father Conmor: and Lormar my brother, king of streams. Nor darkening alone are they; a beam, from other lands, is nigh; the friend of strangers in Atha, the troubler of the field. High, from their misty hills, look forth the blue eyes of Erin; for he is far away, young dweller of their souls! Nor harmless, white hands of Erin! is Cathmor in the skirts of war; he rolls ten thousand before him, in his distant field.” “Not unseen by Ossian,” I said, “rushed Cathmor from his streams, when he poured his strength on I-thorno, isle of many waves! In strife met two kings in I-thorno, Culgorm and Suran-dronlo: each from his echoing isle, stern hunters of the boar! “They met a boar, at a foamy stream: each pierced him with his spear. They strove for the fame of the deed; and gloomy battle rose. From isle to isle they sent a spear, broken and stained with blood, to call the friends of their fathers, in their sounding arms. Cathmor came, from Erin, to Culgorm, red-eyed king: I aided Suran-dronlo, in his land of boars. “We rushed on either side of a stream, which roared through a blasted heath. High broken rocks were round, with all their bending trees. Near were two circles of Loda, with the stone of power; where spirits descended, by night, in dark-red streams of fire. There, mixed with the murmur of waters, rose the voice of aged men; they called the forms of night to aid them in their war.” Heedless I stood, with my people, where fell the foamy stream from rocks. The moon moved red from the mountain. My song, at times, arose. Dark, on the other side, young Cathmor heard my voice; for he lay, beneath the oak, in all his gleaming arms. Morning came; we rushed to fight: from wing to wing is the rolling of strife. They fell, like the thistle's head, beneath autumnal winds. In armour came a stately form: I mixed my strokes with the chief. By turns our shields are pierced: loud rung our steely mails. His helmet fell to the ground. In brightness shone the foe. His eyes, two pleasant flames, rolled between his wandering locks. I knew Cathmor of Atha, and threw my spear on earth. Dark, we turned, and silent passed to mix with other foes. “Not so passed the striving kings. They mixed in echoing fray; like the meeting of ghosts in the dark wing of winds. Through either breast rushed the spears; nor yet lay the foes on earth! A rock received their fall; half-reclined they lay in death. Each held the lock of his foe; each grimly seemed to roll his eyes. The stream of the rock leapt on their shields, and mixed below with blood. “The battle ceased in I-thorno. The strangers met in peace: Cathmor from Atha of streams, and Ossian, king of harps. We placed the dead in earth. Our steps were by Runar's bay. With the bounding boat, afar, advanced a ridgy wave. Dark was the rider of seas, but a beam of light was there, like the ray of the sun, in Stromlo's rolling smoke. It was the daughter of Suran-dronlo, wild in brightened looks. Her eyes were wandering flames, amidst disordered locks. Forward is her white arm, with the spear; her high-heaving breast is seen, white as foamy waves that rise, by turns, amidst rocks. They are beautiful, but terrible, and mariners call the winds!” “Come, ye dwellers of Loda!” she said, “come, Carchar, pale in the midst of clouds! Sluthmor, that stridest in airy halls! Corchtur, terrible in winds! Receive, from his daughter's spear, the foes of Suran-dronlo. No shadow, at his roaring streams; no mildly-looking form was he! When he took up his spear, the hawks shook their sounding wings; for blood was poured around the steps of dark-eyed Suran-dronlo. He lighted me, no harmless beam, to glitter on his streams. Like meteors I was bright; but I blasted the foes of Suran-dronlo.” Nor unconcerned heard Sul-malla, the praise of Cathmor of shields. He was within her soul, like a fire in secret heath, which awakes at the voice of the blast, and sends its beam abroad. Amidst the song removed the daughter of kings, like the voice of a summer breeze; when it lifts the heads of flowers, and curls the lakes and streams. The rustling sound gently spreads o'er the vale, softly-pleasing as it saddens the soul. By night came a dream to Ossian; formless stood the shadow of Trenmor. He seemed to strike the dim shield, on Selma's streamy rock. I rose, in my rattling steel; I knew that war was near. Before the winds our sails were spread; when Lumon shewed its streams to the morn. Come from the watching of night, Malvina, lonely beam! CATH-LODA: A POEM. DUAN FIRST. ARGUMENT. Fingal, when very young, making a voyage to the Orkney islands, was driven, by stress of weather, into a bay of Scandinavia, near the residence of Starno, king of Lochlin. Starno invites Fingal to a feast. Fingal, doubting the faith of the king, and, mindful of a former breach of hospitality, refuses to go. Starno gathers together his tribes: Fingal resolves to defend himself. Night coming on, Duth-maruno proposes to Fingal to observe the motions of the enemy. The king himself undertakes the watch. Advancing towards the enemy, he accidentally comes to the cave of Turthor, where Starno had confined Conban-carglas, the captive daughter of a neighbouring chief. Her story is imperfect, a part of the original being lost. Fingal comes to a place of worship, where Starno and his son, Swaran, consulted the spirit of Loda, concerning the issue of the war. The rencounter of Fingal and Swaran. Duän first concludes with a description of the airy hall of Cruth-loda, supposed to be the Odin of Scandinavia. Macpherson. A tale of the times of old! A tale of the times of old! Why, thou wanderer unseen! thou bender of the thistle of Lora; why, thou breeze of the valley, hast thou left mine ear? I hear no distant roar of streams! No sound of the harp, from the rock! Come, thou huntress of Lutha, Malvina, call back his soul to the bard. I look forward to Lochlin of lakes, to the dark billowy bay of U-thorno, where Fingal descends from ocean, from the roar of winds. Few are the heroes of Morven, in a land unknown! Starno sent a dweller of Loda, to bid Fingal to the feast; but the king remembered the past, and all his rage arose. “Nor Gormal's mossy towers, nor Starno shall Fingal behold. Deaths wander, like shadows, over his fiery soul! Do I forget that beam of light, the white-handed daughter of kings? Go, son of Loda; his words are wind to Fingal: wind, that, to and fro, drives the thistle, in autumn's dusky vale. Duth-maruno, arm of death! Crommaglas, of iron shields! Struthmor, dweller of battle's wing! Cormar, whose ships bound on seas, careless as the course of a meteor, on dark-rolling clouds! Arise, around me, children of heroes, in a land unknown! Let each look on his shield, like Trenmor, the ruler of wars. “Come down,” thus Trenmor said, “thou dweller between the harps. Thou shalt roll this stream away, or waste with me in earth.” Around the king they rise in wrath. No words come forth: they seize their spears. Each soul is rolled into itself. At length the sudden clang is waked, on all their echoing shields. Each takes his hill, by night; at intervals, they darkly stand. Unequal bursts the hum of songs, between the roaring wind! Broad over them rose the moon! In his arms came tall Duth-maruno; he from Croma of rocks, stern hunter of the boar! In his dark boat he rose on waves, when Crumthormo awaked its woods. In the chace he shone, among foes: No fear was thine, Duth-maruno! “Son of daring Comhal, shall my steps be forward through night! From this shield shall I view them, over their gleaming tribes? Starno, king of lakes, is before me, and Swaran, the foe of strangers. Their words are not in vain, by Loda's stone of power.—Should Duth-maruno not return, his spouse is lonely, at home, where meet two roaring streams, on Crathmo-craulo's plain. Around are hills, with echoing woods; the ocean is rolling near. My son looks on screaming sea-fowl, a young wanderer on the field. Give the head of a boar to Can-dona, tell him of his father's joy, when the bristly strength of I-thorno rolled on his lifted spear. Tell him of my deeds in war! Tell where his father fell!” “Not forgetful of my fathers,” said Fingal, “I have bounded over the seas. Theirs were the times of danger, in the days of old. Nor settles darkness on me, before foes, though youthful in my locks. Chief of Crathmo-craulo, the field of night is mine.” Fingal rushed, in all his arms, wide-bounding over Turthor's stream, that sent its sullen roar, by night, through Gormal's misty vale. A moonbeam glittered on a rock; in the midst stood a stately form; a form with floating locks, like Lochlin's white-bosomed maids. Unequal are her steps, and short. She throws a broken song on wind. At times she tosses her white arms; for grief is dwelling in her soul. “Torcul-torno, of aged locks!” she said, “where now are thy steps, by Lulan! Thou hast failed, at thine own dark streams, father of Conban-cârglas! But I behold thee, chief of Lulan, sporting by Loda's hall, when the dark-skirted night is rolled along the sky.—Thou, sometimes, hidest the moon with thy shield. I have seen her dim in heaven. Thou kindlest thy hair into meteors, and sailest along the night. Why am I forgot, in my cave, king of shaggy boars? Look, from the hall of Loda, on thy lonely daughter.” “Who art thou,” said Fingal, “voice of night?” She, trembling, turned away. “Who art thou, in thy darkness?” She shrunk into the cave. The king loosed the thong from her hands. He asked about her fathers. “Torcul-torno,” she said, “once dwelt at Lulan's foamy stream: he dwelt—but now, in Loda's hall, he shakes the sounding shell. He met Starno of Lochlin in war; long fought the dark-eyed kings. My father fell, in his blood, blue-shielded Torcul-torno! By a rock, at Lulan's stream, I had pierced the bounding roe. My white hand gathered my hair, from off the rushing winds. I heard a noise. Mine eyes were up. My soft breast rose on high. My step was forward, at Lulan, to meet thee, Torcul-torno! It was Starno, dreadful king! His red eyes rolled on me in love. Dark waved his shaggy brow, above his gathered smile. Where is my father, I said, he that was mighty in war? Thou art left alone among foes, O daughter of Torcul-torno! He took my hand. He raised the sail. In this cave he placed me dark. At times, he comes, a gathered mist. He lifts, before me, my father's shield. But often passes a beam of youth, far-distant from my cave. The son of Starno moves in my sight. He dwells lonely in my soul.” “Maid of Lulan,” said Fingal, “white-handed daughter of grief! a cloud, marked with streaks of fire, is rolled along thy soul. Look not to that dark-robed moon; look not to those meteors of heaven. My gleaming steel is around thee, the terror of thy foes! It is not the steel of the feeble, nor of the dark in soul! The maids are not shut in our caves of streams. They toss not their white arms alone. They bend, fair within their locks, above the harps of Selma. Their voice is not in the desert wild. We melt along the pleasing sound!” Fingal again advanced his steps, wide through the bosom of night, to where the trees of Loda shook amid squally winds. Three stones, with heads of moss, are there; a stream, with foaming course: and dreadful, rolled around them, is the dark-red cloud of Loda. High from its top looked forward a ghost, half-formed of the shadowy smoke. He poured his voice, at times, amidst the roaring stream. Near, bending beneath a blasted tree, two heroes received his words: Swaran of lakes, and Starno, foe of strangers. On their dun shields they darkly leaned: their spears are forward through night. Shrill sounds the blast of darkness, in Starno's floating beard. They heard the tread of Fingal. The warriors rose in arms. “Swaran, lay that wanderer low,” said Starno, in his pride. “Take the shield of thy father. It is a rock in war.”—Swaran threw his gleaming spear. It stood fixed in Loda's tree. Then came the foes forward, with swords. They mixed their rattling steel. Through the thongs of Swaran's shield rushed the blade of Luno. The shield fell rolling on earth. Cleft the helmet fell down. Fingal stopt the lifted steel. Wrathful stood Swaran, unarmed. He rolled his silent eyes; he threw his sword on earth. Then, slowly stalking over the stream, he whistled as he went. Nor unseen of his father is Swaran. Starno turns away in wrath. His shaggy brows wave dark, above his gathered rage. He strikes Loda's tree with his spear. He raises the hum of songs. They come to the host of Lochlin, each in his own dark path; like two foam-covered streams, from two rainy vales! To Turthor's plain Fingal returned. Fair rose the beam of the east. It shone on the spoils of Lochlin in the hand of the king. From her cave came forth, in her beauty, the daughter of Torcul-torno. She gathered her hair from wind. She wildly raised her song. The song of Lulan of shells, where once her father dwelt. She saw Starno's bloody shield. Gladness rose, a light, on her face. She saw the cleft helmet of Swaran. She shrunk, darkened, from Fingal. “Art thou fallen, by thy hundred streams, O love of the mournful maid.” U-thorno, that risest in waters! on whose side are the meteors of night! I behold the dark moon descending, behind thy resounding woods. On thy top dwells the misty Loda, the house of the spirits of men! In the end of his cloudy hall, bends forward Cruth-loda of swords. His form is dimly seen, amid his wavy mist. His right hand is on his shield. In his left is the half-viewless shell. The roof of his dreadful hall is marked with nightly fires! The race of Cruth-loda advance, a ridge of formless shades. He reaches the sounding shell, to those who shone in war. But, between him and the feeble, his shield rises, a darkened orb. He is a setting meteor to the weak in arms. Bright, as a rainbow on streams, came Lulan's white-bosomed maid. DUAN SECOND. ARGUMENT. Fingal returning, with day, devolves the command on Duth-maruno, who engages the enemy, and drives them over the stream of Turthor. Having recalled his people, he congratulates Duth-maruno on his success; but discovers, that that hero had been mortally wounded in the action.—Duth-maruno dies. Ullin, the bard, in honour of the dead, introduces the episode of Colgorm and Strina-dona, which concludes this duän. Macpherson. “Where art thou, son of the king,” said dark-haired Duth-maruno? “Where hast thou failed, young beam of Selma? He returns not, from the bosom of night! Morning is spread on Uthorno. In his mist is the sun, on his hill. Warriors, lift the shields, in my presence. He must not fall, like a fire from heaven, whose place is not marked on the ground. He comes, like an eagle from the skirt of his squally wind! In his hand are the spoils of foes. King of Selma, our souls were sad! “Near us are the foes, Duth-maruno. They come forward, like waves in mist, when their foamy tops are seen, at times, above the low-sailing vapour. The traveller shrinks on his journey; he knows not whither to fly. No trembling travellers are we! Sons of heroes call forth the steel. Shall the sword of Fingal arise, or shall a warrior lead?” “The deeds of old,” said Duth-maruno, “are like paths to our eyes, O Fingal. Broad-shielded Trenmor is still seen, amidst his own dim years. Nor feeble was the soul of the king. There, no dark deed wandered in secret. From their hundred streams came the tribes, to grassy Colglancrona. Their chiefs were before them. Each strove to lead the war. Their swords were often half unsheathed. Red rolled their eyes of rage. Separate they stood, and hummed their surly songs. “Why should they yield to each other? their fathers were equal in war.” Trenmor was there, with his people, stately in youthful locks. He saw the advancing foe. The grief of his soul arose. He bade the chiefs to lead, by turns: they led; but they were rolled away. From his own mossy hill blue-shielded Trenmor came down. He led wide-skirted battle, and the strangers failed. Around him the dark-browed warriors came: they struck the shield of joy. Like a pleasant gale, the words of power rushed forth from Selma of kings. But the chiefs led, by turns, in war, till mighty danger rose: then was the hour of the king to conquer in the field. “Not unknown,” said Cromma-glass of shields, “are the deeds of our fathers. But who shall now lead the war, before the race of kings? Mist settles on these four dark hills: within it let each warrior strike his shield. Spirits may descend in darkness, and mark us for the war.” They went, each to his hill of mist. Bards marked the sounds of the shields. Loudest rung thy boss, Duth-maruno. Thou must lead in war! Like the murmur of waters, the race of U-thorno came down. Starno led the battle, and Swaran of stormy isles. They looked forward from iron shields, like Cruth-loda fiery-eyed, when he looks from behind the darkened moon, and strews his signs on night. The foes met by Turthor's stream. They heaved like ridgy waves. Their echoing strokes are mixed. Shadowy death flies over the hosts. They were clouds of hail, with squally winds in their skirts. Their showers are roaring together. Below them swells the dark-rolling deep. Strife of gloomy U-thorno, why should I mark thy wounds! Thou art with the years that are gone! thou fadest on my soul! Starno brought forward his skirt of war, and Swaran his own dark wing. Nor a harmless fire is Duth-maruno's sword. Lochlin is rolled over her streams. The wrathful kings are lost in thought. They roll their silent eyes, over the flight of their land. The horn of Fingal was heard; the sons of woody Albion returned. But many lay, by Turthor's stream, silent in their blood. “Chief of Crathmo,” said the king, “Duth-maruno, hunter of boars! not harmless returns my eagle, from the field of foes! For this white-bosomed Lanul shall brighten, at her streams; Candona shall rejoice, as he wanders in Crathmo's fields.” “Colgorm,” replied the chief, “was the first of my race in Albion; Colgorm, the rider of ocean, through its watry vales. He slew his brother in I-thorno: he left the land of his fathers. He chose his place, in silence, by rocky Crathmo-craulo. His race came forth, in their years; they came forth to war, but they always fell. The wound of my fathers is mine, king of echoing isles!” He drew an arrow from his side! He fell pale, in a land unknown. His soul came forth to his fathers, to their stormy isle. There they pursued boars of mist, along the skirts of wind. The chiefs stood silent around, as the stones of Loda on their hill. The traveller sees them, through the twilight, from his lonely path. He thinks them the ghosts of the aged, forming future wars. Night came down on U-thorno. Still stood the chiefs in their grief. The blast whistled by turns, through every warrior's hair. Fingal, at length, broke forth from the thoughts of his soul. He called Ullin of harps, and bade the song to rise. “No falling fire, that is only seen, and then retires in night; no departing meteor was he that is laid so low. He was like the strong-beaming sun, long rejoicing on his hill. Call the names of his fathers, from their dwellings old!” I-thorno, said the bard, that risest midst ridgy seas! why is thy head so gloomy, in the ocean's mist? From thy vales came forth a race, fearless as thy strong-winged eagles; the race of Colgorm of iron shields, dwellers of Loda's hall. In Tormoth's resounding isle, arose Lurthan, streamy hill. It bent its woody head over a silent vale. There, at foamy Cruruth's source, dwelt Rurmar, hunter of boars! His daughter was fair as a sun-beam, white-bosomed Strina-dona! Many a king of heroes, and hero of iron shields; many a youth of heavy locks came to Rurmar's echoing hall. They came to woo the maid, the stately huntress of Tormoth wild. But thou lookest careless from thy steps, high-bosomed Strina-dona! If on the heath she moved, her breast was whiter than the down of Cana; if on the sea-beat shore, than the foam of the rolling ocean. Her eyes were two stars of light. Her face was heaven's bow in showers. Her dark hair flowed round it, like the streaming clouds. Thou wert the dweller of souls, white-handed Strina-dona! Colgorm came, in his ship, and Corcul-Suran, king of shells. The brothers came, from I-thorno, to woo the sun-beam of Tormoth wild. She saw them in their echoing steel. Her soul was fixed on blue-eyed Colgorm. Ul-lochlin's nightly eye looked in, and saw the tossing arms of Strina-dona. Wrathful the brothers frowned. Their flaming eyes, in silence, met. They turned away. They struck their shields. Their hands were trembling on their swords. They rushed into the strife of heroes, for long-haired Strina-dona. Corcul-suran fell in blood. On his isle raged the strength of his father. He turned Colgorm, from I-thorno, to wander on all the winds. In Crathmo-craulo's rocky field, he dwelt by a foreign stream. Nor darkened the king alone; that beam of light was near, the daughter of echoing Tormoth, white-armed Strina-dona. DUAN THIRD. ARGUMENT. Ossian, after some general reflections, describes the situation of Fingal, and the position of the army of Lochlin. The conversation of Starno and Swaran. The episode of Corman-trunar and Foinar-bragal. Starno, from his own example, recommends to Swaran to surprise Fingal, who had retired alone to a neighbouring hill. Upon Swaran's refusal, Starno undertakes the enterprise himself, is overcome, and taken prisoner, by Fingal. He is dismissed, after a severe reprimand for his cruelty. Macpherson. Whence is the stream of years? Whither do they roll along? Where have they hid, in mist, their many-coloured sides? I look into the times of old, but they seem dim to Ossian's eyes, like reflected moon-beams on a distant lake. Here rise the red beams of war! There, silent, dwells a feeble race! They mark no years with their deeds, as slow they pass along. Dweller between the shields! thou that awakest the failing soul! descend from thy wall, harp of Cona, with thy voices three! Come with that which kindles the past: rear the forms of old, on their own dark-brown years! Uthorno, hill of storms, I behold my race on thy side. Fingal is bending, in night, over Duthmaruno's tomb. Near him are the steps of his heroes, hunters of the boar. By Turthor's stream the host of Lochlin is deep in shades. The wrathful kings stood on two hills; they looked forward from their bossy shields. They looked forward to the stars of night, red-wandering in the west. Cruth-loda bends from high, like a formless meteor in clouds. He sends abroad the winds, and marks them, with his sighs. Starno foresaw, that Morven's king was not to yield in war. He twice struck the tree in wrath. He rushed before his son. He hummed a surly song; and heard his hair in wind. Turned from one another, they stood, like two oaks, which different winds had bent; each hangs over its own loud rill, and shakes its boughs in the course of blasts. “Annir,” said Starno of lakes, “was a fire that consumed of old. He poured death from his eyes, along the striving fields. His joy was in the fall of men. Blood, to him, was a summer stream, that brings joy to withered vales, from its own mossy rock. He came forth to the lake Luth-cormo, to meet the tall Corman-trunar, he from Urlor of streams, dweller of battle's wing. The chief of Urlor had come to Gormal, with his dark-bosomed ships. He saw the daughter of Annir, white-armed Foina-brâgal. He saw her! Nor careless rolled her eyes, on the rider of stormy waves. She fled to his ship in darkness, like a moon-beam through a nightly vale. Annir pursued along the deep; he called the winds of heaven. Nor alone was the king! Starno was by his side. Like U-thorno's young eagle, I turned my eyes on my father. We rushed into roaring Urlor. With his people came tall Corman-trunar. We fought; but the foe prevailed. In his wrath my father stood. He lopped the young trees, with his sword. His eyes rolled red in his rage. I marked the soul of the king, and I retired in night. From the field I took a broken helmet: a shield that was pierced with steel: pointless was the spear in my hand. I went to find the foe. On a rock sat tall Corman-trunar, beside his burning oak; and near him, beneath a tree, sat deep-bosomed Foina-brâgal. I threw my broken shield before her. I spoke the words of peace. “Beside his rolling sea, lies Annir of many lakes. The king was pierced in battle; and Starno is to raise his tomb. Me, a son of Loda, he sends to white-handed Foina, to bid her send a lock from her hair, to rest with her father, in earth. And thou king of roaring Urlor, let the battle cease, till Annir receive the shell, from fiery-eyed Cruth-loda. Bursting into tears, she rose, and tore a lock from her hair: a lock, which wandered, in the blast, along her heaving breast. Corman-trunar gave the shell, and bade me to rejoice before him. I rested in the shade of night, and hid my face in my helmet deep. Sleep descended on the foe. I rose, like a stalking ghost. I pierced the side of Corman-trunar. Nor did Foina-brâgal escape. She rolled her white bosom in blood. Why, then, daughter of heroes, didst thou wake my rage? Morning rose. The foe were fled, like the departure of mist. Annir struck his bossy shield. He called his dark-haired son. I came, streaked with wandering blood: thrice rose the shout of the king, like the bursting forth of a squall of wind, from a cloud, by night. We rejoiced, three days, above the dead, and called the hawks of heaven. They came, from all their winds, to feast on Annir's foes. Swaran! Fingal is alone, on his hill of night. Let thy spear pierce the king in secret; like Annir, my soul shall rejoice. “Son of Annir,” said Swaran, “I shall not slay in shades. I move forth in light: the hawks rush from all their winds. They are wont to trace my course: it is not harmless through war.” Burning rose the rage of the king. He thrice raised his gleaming spear. But, starting, he spared his son; and rushed into the night. By Turthor's cave a stream is dark, the dwelling of Conban-carglas. There he laid the helmet of kings, and called the maid of Lulan; but she was distant far, in Loda's resounding hall. Swelling in his rage, he strode, to where Fingal lay alone. The king was laid on his shield, on his own secret hill. Stern hunter of shaggy boars! no feeble maid is laid before thee. No boy, on his ferny bed, by Turthor's murmuring stream. Here is spread the couch of the mighty, from which they rise to deeds of death! Hunter of shaggy boars, awaken not the terrible! Starno came murmuring on. Fingal arose in arms. “Who art thou, son of night?” Silent he threw the spear. They mixed their gloomy strife. The shield of Starno fell, cleft in twain. He is bound to an oak. The early beam arose. It was then Fingal beheld the king. He rolled a while his silent eyes. He thought of other days, when the white-bosomed Agandecca moved like the music of songs. He loosed the thongs from his hands. “Son of Annir,” he said, “retire. Retire to Gormal of shells; a beam that was set returns. I remember thy white-bosomed daughter; dreadful king away! Go to thy troubled dwelling, cloudy foe of the lovely! Let the stranger shun thee, thou gloomy in the hall! A tale of the times of old! OINA-MORUL: A POEM. ARGUMENT. After an address to Malvina, the daughter of Toscar, Ossian proceeds to relate his own expedition to Fuärfed, an island of Scandinavia. Mal-orchol, king of Fuärfed, being hard pressed in war, by Ton-thormod, chief of Sar-dronlo (who had demanded, in vain, the daughter of Mal-orchol in marriage), Fingal sent Ossian to his aid. Ossian, on the day after his arrival, came to battle with Ton-thormod, and took him prisoner. Mal-orchol offers his daughter Oina-morul to Ossian; but he, discovering her passion for Ton-thormod, generously surrenders her to her lover, and brings about a reconciliation between the two kings. Macpherson. As flies the inconstant sun As flies the inconstant sun, over Larmon's grassy hill; so pass the tales of old, along my soul, by night! When bards are removed to their place; when harps are hung in Selma's hall; then comes a voice to Ossian, and awakes his soul! It is the voice of years that are gone! they roll before me, with all their deeds! I seize the tales, as they pass, and pour them forth in song. Nor a troubled stream is the song of the king, it is like the rising of music from Lutha of the strings. Lutha of many strings, not silent are thy streamy rocks, when the white hands of Malvina move upon the harp! Light of the shadowy thoughts, that fly across my soul, daughter of Toscar of helmets, wilt thou not hear the song! We call back, maid of Lutha, the years that have rolled away. It was in the days of the king, while yet my locks were young, that I marked Con-cathlin, on high, from ocean's nightly wave. My course was towards the isle of Fuärfed, woody dweller of seas! Fingal had sent me to the aid of Mal-orchol, king of Fuärfed wild: for war was around him, and our fathers had met, at the feast. In Col-coiled, I bound my sails; I sent my sword to Mal-orchol of shells. He knew the signal of Albion, and his joy arose. He came from his own high hall, and seized my hand in grief. “Why comes the race of heroes to a falling king? Ton-thormod of many spears is the chief of wavy Sar-dronlo. He saw and loved my daughter, white-bosomed Oina-morul. He sought; I denied the maid; for our fathers had been foes. He came, with battle, to Fuärfed; my people are rolled away. Why comes the race of heroes to a falling king?” “I come not,” I said, “to look, like a boy, on the strife. Fingal remembers Mal-orchol, and his hall for strangers. From his waves, the warrior descended, on thy woody isle. Thou wert no cloud before him. Thy feast was spread with songs. For this my sword shall rise; and thy foes perhaps may fail. Our friends are not forgot in their danger, though distant is our land.” “Descendant of the daring Trenmor, thy words are like the voice of Cruth-loda, when he speaks, from his parting cloud, strong dweller of the sky! Many have rejoiced at my feast; but they all have forgot Mal-orchol. I have looked towards all the winds; but no white sails were seen. But steel resounds in my hall; and not the joyful shells. Come to my dwelling, race of heroes; dark-skirted night is near. Hear the voice of songs, from the maid of Fuärfed wild.” We went. On the harp arose the white hands of Oina-morul. She waked her own sad tale, from every trembling string. I stood in silence; for bright in her locks was the daughter of many isles! Her eyes were two stars, looking forward through a rushing shower. The mariner marks them on high, and blesses the lovely beams. With morning we rushed to battle, to Tormul's resounding stream: the foe moved to the sound of Ton-thormod's bossy shield. From wing to wing the strife was mixed. I met Ton-thormod in fight. Wide flew his broken steel. I seized the king in war. I gave his hand, bound fast with thongs, to Mal-orchol, the giver of shells. Joy rose at the feast of Fuärfed; for the foe had failed. Ton-thormod turned his face away, from Oina-morul of isles! “Son of Fingal,” begun Mal-orchol, “not forgot shalt thou pass from me. A light shall dwell in thy ship, Oina-morul of slow-rolling eyes. She shall kindle gladness, along thy mighty soul. Nor unheeded shall the maid move in Selma, through the dwelling of kings!” In the hall I lay in night. Mine eyes were half-closed in sleep. Soft music came to mine ear: it was like the rising breeze, that whirls, at first, the thistle's beard; then flies, dark-shadowy, over the grass. It was the maid of Fuärfed wild! she raised the nightly song; she knew that my soul was a stream, that flowed at pleasant sounds. “Who looks,” she said, “from his rock, on ocean's closing mist? His long locks, like the raven's wing, are wandering on the blast. Stately are his steps in grief! The tears are in his eyes! His manly breast is heaving over his bursting soul! Retire, I am distant far; a wanderer in lands unknown. Though the race of kings are around me, yet my soul is dark. Why have our fathers been foes, Ton-thormod, love of maids!” “Soft voice of the streamy isle,” I said, “why dost thou mourn by night? The race of daring Trenmor are not the dark in soul. Thou shalt not wander, by streams unknown, blue-eyed Oina-morul! Within this bosom is a voice; it comes not to other ears: it bids Ossian hear the hapless, in their hour of woe. Retire, soft singer by night; Ton-thormod shall not mourn on his rock!” With morning I loosed the king. I gave the long-haired maid. Mal-orchol heard my words, in the midst of his echoing halls. “King of Fuärfed wild, why should Ton-thormod mourn? He is of the race of heroes, and a flame in war. Your fathers have been foes, but now their dim ghosts rejoice in death. They stretch their hands of mist to the same shell in Loda. Forget their rage, ye warriors, it was the cloud of other years.” Such were the deeds of Ossian, while yet his locks were young: though loveliness, with a robe of beams, clothed the daughter of many isles. We call back, maid of Lutha, the years that have rolled away! COLNA-DONA: A POEM. ARGUMENT. Fingal dispatches Ossian and Toscar, the son of Conloch and father of Malvina, to raise a stone on the banks of the stream of Crona, to perpetuate the memory of a victory, which he had obtained in that place. When they were employed in that work, Car-ul, a neighbouring chief, invited them to a feast. They went: and Toscar fell desperately in love with Colna-dona, the daughter of Car-ul. Colna-dona became no less enamoured of Toscar. An incident, at a hunting party, brings their loves to a happy issue. Macpherson. Col-amon of troubled streams Col-amon of troubled streams, dark wanderer of distant vales, I behold thy course, between trees, near Car-ul's echoing halls! There dwelt bright Colna-dona, the daughter of the king. Her eyes were rolling stars; her arms were white as the foam of streams. Her breast rose slowly to sight, like ocean's heaving wave. Her soul was a stream of light. Who, among the maids, was like the love of heroes? Beneath the voice of the king, we moved to Crona of the streams, Toscar of grassy Lutha, and Ossian, young in fields. Three bards attended with songs. Three bossy shields were borne before us; for we were to rear the stone, in memory of the past. By Crona's mossy course, Fingal had scattered his foes: he had rolled away the strangers, like a troubled sea. We came to the place of renown; from the mountains descended night. I tore an oak from its hill, and raised a flame on high. I bade my fathers to look down, from the clouds of their hall; for, at the fame of their race, they brighten in the wind. I took a stone from the stream, amidst the song of bards. The blood of Fingal's foes hung curdled in its ooze. Beneath, I placed, at intervals, three bosses from the shields of foes, as rose or fell the sound of Ullin's nightly song. Toscar laid a dagger in earth, a mail of sounding steel. We raised the mould around the stone, and bade it speak to other years. Oozy daughter of streams, that now art reared on high, speak to the feeble, O stone, after Selma's race have failed! Prone, from the stormy night, the traveller shall lay him, by thy side: thy whistling moss shall sound in his dreams; the years that were past shall return. Battles rise before him, blue-shielded kings descend to war: the darkened moon looks from heaven, on the troubled field. He shall burst, with morning, from dreams, and see the tombs of warriors round. He shall ask about the stone; and the aged shall reply, “This grey stone was raised by Ossian, a chief of other years!” From Col-amon came a bard, from Car-ul, the friend of strangers. He bade us to the feast of kings, to the dwelling of bright Colna-dona. We went to the hall of harps. There Car-ul brightened between his aged locks, when he beheld the sons of his friends, like two young branches before him. “Sons of the mighty,” he said, “ye bring back the days of old, when first I descended from waves, on Selma's streamy vale! I pursued Duthmocarglos, dweller of ocean's wind. Our fathers had been foes, we met by Clutha's winding waters. He fled, along the sea, and my sails were spread behind him. Night deceived me, on the deep I came to the dwelling of kings, to Selma of high-bosomed maids. Fingal came forth with his bards, and Conloch, arm of death. I feasted three days in the hall, and saw the blue-eyes of Erin, Ros-crana, daughter of heroes, light of Cormac's race. Nor forgot did my steps depart: the kings gave their shields to Car-ul: they hang, on high, in Col-amon, in memory of the past. Sons of the daring kings, ye bring back the days of old!” Car-ul kindled the oak of feasts. He took two bosses from our shields. He laid them in earth, beneath a stone, to speak to the hero's race. “When battle,” said the king, “shall roar, and our sons are to meet in wrath, my race shall look, perhaps, on this stone, when they prepare the spear. Have not our fathers met in peace, they will say, and lay aside the shield?” Night came down. In her long locks moved the daughter of Car-ul. Mixed with the harp arose the voice of white-armed Colna-dona. Toscar darkened in his place, before the love of heroes. She came on his troubled soul, like a beam to the dark-heaving ocean: when it bursts from a cloud, and brightens the foamy side of a wave. With morning we awaked the woods; and hung forward on the path of the roes. They fell by their wonted streams. We returned through Crona's vale. From the wood a youth came forward, with a shield and pointless spear. “Whence,” said Toscar of Lutha, “is the flying beam? Dwells there peace at Col-amon, round bright Colna-dona of harps?” “By Col-amon of streams,” said the youth, “bright Colna-dona dwelt. She dwelt; but her course is now in deserts, with the son of the king; he that seized with love her soul as it wandered through the hall.” “Stranger of tales,” said Toscar, “hast thou marked the warrior's course? He must fall, give thou that bossy shield!” In wrath he took the shield. Fair behind it rose the breasts of a maid, white as the bosom of a swan, rising graceful on swift-rolling waves. It was Colna-dona of harps, the daughter of the king! Her blue eyes had rolled on Toscar, and her love! arose!

Vos quoque qui fortes animas, belloque peremtas Laudibus in longum vates dimittitis ævum, Plurima securi fudistis carmina Bardi. Lucan. I. SHILRIC, VINVELA. Vinvela. My love is a son of the hill. My love is a son of the hill. He pursues the flying deer. His gray dogs are panting around him; his bow-string sounds in the wind. Whether by the fount of the rock, or by the stream of the mountain thou liest; when the rushes are nodding with the wind, and the mist is flying over thee, let me approach my love unperceived, and see him from the rock. Lovely I saw thee first by the aged oak of Branno; thou wert returning tall from the chace; the fairest among thy friends. Shilric. What voice is that I hear? that voice like the summer wind. I sit not by the nodding rushes; I hear not the fount of the rock. Afar, Vinvela, afar I go to the wars of Fingal. My dogs attend me no more. No more I tread the hill. No more from on high I see thee, fair-moving by the stream of the plain; bright as the bow of heaven; as the moon on the western wave. Vinvela. Then thou art gone, O Shilric! and I am alone on the hill. The deer are seen on the brow; void of fear they graze along. No more they dread the wind; no more the rustling tree. The hunter is far removed; he is in the field of graves. Strangers! sons of the waves! spare my lovely Shilric. Shilric. If fall I must in the field, raise high my grave, Vinvela. Grey stones, and heaped-up earth, shall mark me to future times. When the hunter shall sit by the mound, and produce his food at noon, “Some warrior rests here,” he will say; and my fame shall live in his praise. Remember me, Vinvela, when low on earth I lie! Vinvela. Yes!—I will remember thee—indeed my Shilric will fall. What shall I do, my love! when thou art gone for ever? Through these hills I will go at noon: I will go through the silent heath. There I will see the place of thy rest, returning from the chace. Indeed, my Shilric will fall; but I will remember him. II. [I sit by the mossy fountain] I sit by the mossy fountain; on the top of the hill of winds. I sit by the mossy fountain; on the top of the hill of winds. One tree is rustling above me. Dark waves roll over the heath. The lake is troubled below. The deer descend from the hill. No hunter at a distance is seen; no whistling cow-herd is nigh. It is mid-day: but all is silent. Sad are my thoughts alone. Didst thou but appear, O my love, a wanderer on the heath! thy hair floating on the wind behind thee; thy bosom heaving on the sight; thine eyes full of tears for thy friends, whom the mist of the hill had concealed! Thee I would comfort, my love, and bring thee to thy father's house. But is it she that there appears, like a beam of light on the heath? bright as the moon in autumn, as the sun in a summer storm, comest thou, lovely maid, over rocks, over mountains to me?—She speaks: but how weak her voice! like the breeze in the reeds of the pool. Hark! Returnest thou safe from the war? Where are thy friends, my love? I heard of thy death on the hill; I heard and mourned thee, Shilric! Yes, my fair, I return; but I alone of my race. Thou shalt see them no more: their graves I raised on the plain. But why art thou on the desert hill? why on the heath, alone? Alone I am, O Shilric! alone in the winter-house. With grief for thee I expired. Shilric, I am pale in the tomb. She fleets, she sails away; as grey mist before the wind!—and, wilt thou not stay, my love? Stay and behold my tears! fair thou appearest, my love! fair thou wast, when alive! By the mossy fountain I will sit; on the top of the hill of winds. When mid-day is silent around, converse, O my love, with me! come on the wings of the gale! on the blast of the mountain, come! Let me hear thy voice, as thou passest, when mid-day is silent around. III. [Evening is grey on the hills] Evening is grey on the hills. Evening is grey on the hills. The north wind resounds through the woods. White clouds rise on the sky: the thin-wavering snow descends. The river howls afar, along its winding course. Sad, by a hollow rock, the grey-haired Carryl sat. Dry fern waves over his head; his seat is in an aged birch. Clear to the roaring winds he lifts his voice of woe. Tossed on the wavy ocean is He, the hope of the isles; Malcolm, the support of the poor; foe to the proud in arms! Why hast thou left us behind? why live we to mourn thy fate? We might have heard, with thee, the voice of the deep; have seen the oozy rock. Sad on the sea-beat shore thy spouse looketh for thy return. The time of thy promise is come; the night is gathering around. But no white sail is on the sea; no voice but the blustering winds. Low is the soul of the war! Wet are the locks of youth! By the foot of some rock thou liest; washed by the waves as they come. Why, ye winds, did ye bear him on the desert rock? Why, ye waves, did ye roll over him? But, Oh! what voice is that? Who rides on that meteor of fire? Green are his airy limbs. It is he! it is the ghost of Malcolm! Rest, lovely soul, rest on the rock; and let me hear thy voice. He is gone, like a dream of the night. I see him through the trees. Daughter of Reynold! he is gone. Thy spouse shall return no more. No more shall his hounds come from the hill, forerunners of their master. No more from the distant rock shall his voice greet thine ear. Silent is he in the deep, unhappy daughter of Reynold! I will sit by the stream of the plain. Ye rocks! hang over my head. Hear my voice, ye trees! as ye bend on the shaggy hill. My voice shall preserve the praise of him, the hope of the isles. IV. CONNAL, CRIMORA. Crimora. Who cometh from the hill Who cometh from the hill, like a cloud tinged with the beam of the west? Whose voice is that, loud as the wind, but pleasant as the harp of Carryl? It is my love in the light of steel; but sad is his darkened brow. Live the mighty race of Fingal? or what disturbs my Connal? Connal. They live. I saw them return from the chace, like a stream of light. The sun was on their shields: Like a ridge of fire they descended the hill. Loud is the voice of the youth; the war, my love, is near. To-morrow the enormous Dargo comes to try the force of our race. The race of Fingal he defies; the race of battle and wounds. Crimora. Connal, I saw his sails like grey mist on the sable wave. They slowly came to land. Connal, many are the warriors of Dargo! Connal. Bring me thy father's shield; the iron shield of Rinval; that shield like the full moon when it is darkened in the sky. Crimora. That shield I bring, O Connal; but it did not defend my father. By the spear of Gauror he fell. Thou mayst fall, O Connal! Connal. Fall indeed I may: But raise my tomb, Crimora. Some stones, a mound of earth, shall keep my memory. Bend thy red eye over my tomb, and beat thy breast of sighs. Though fair thou art, my love, as the light; more pleasant than the gale of the hill; yet I will not stay. Raise my tomb, Crimora. Crimora. Then give me those arms of light; that sword, and that spear of steel. I shall meet Dargo with thee, and aid my lovely Connal. Farewell, ye rocks of Ardven! ye deer! and ye streams of the hill! We shall return no more. Our tombs are distant far. V. Autumn is dark on the mountains Autumn is dark on the mountains Autumn is dark on the mountains; grey mist rests on the hills. The whirlwind is heard on the heath. Dark rolls the river through the narrow plain. A tree stands alone on the hill, and marks the grave of Connal. The leaves whirl round with the wind, and strew the grave of the dead. At times are seen here the ghosts of the deceased, when the musing hunter alone stalks slowly over the heath. Appear in thy armour of light, thou ghost of the mighty Connal! Shine, near thy tomb, Crimora! like a moon-beam from a cloud. Who can search the source of thy race, O Connal? and who recount thy fathers? Thy family grew like an oak on the mountain, which meeteth the wind with its lofty head. But now it is torn from the earth. Who shall supply the place of Connal? Here was the din of arms; and here the groans of the dying. Mournful are the wars of Fingal! O Connal! it was here thou didst fall. Thine arm was like a storm; thy sword, a beam of the sky; thy height, a rock on the plain; thine eyes, a furnace of fire. Louder than a storm was thy voice, when thou confoundedst the field. Warriors fell by thy sword, as the thistle by the staff of a boy. Dargo the mighty came on, like a cloud of thunder. His brows were contracted and dark. His eyes like two caves in a rock. Bright rose their swords on each side; dire was the clang of their steel. The daughter of Rinval was near; Crimora, bright in the armour of man; her hair loose behind, her bow in her hand. She followed the youth to the war, Connal her much-beloved. She drew the string on Dargo; but erring pierced her Connal. He falls like an oak on the plain; like a rock from the shaggy hill. What shall she do, hapless maid! He bleeds; her Connal dies. All the night long she cries, and all the day, O Connal, my love, and my friend! With grief the sad mourner died. Earth here incloseth the loveliest pair on the hill. The grass grows between the stones of their tomb; I sit in the mournful shade. The wind sighs through the grass; and their memory rushes on my mind. Undisturbed you now sleep together; in the tomb of the mountain you rest alone. VI. [Son of the noble Fingal] Son of the noble Fingal Son of the noble Fingal, Oscian, prince of men! what tears run down the cheeks of age? what shades thy mighty soul? Memory, son of Alpin, memory wounds the aged. Of former times are my thoughts; my thoughts are of the noble Fingal. The race of the king return into my mind, and wound me with remembrance. One day, returned from the sport of the mountains, from pursuing the sons of the hill, we covered this heath with our youth. Fingal the mighty was here, and Oscur, my son, great in war. Fair on our sight from the sea, at once, a virgin came. Her breast was like the snow of one night. Her cheek like the bud of the rose. Mild was her blue-rolling eye: but sorrow was big in her heart. Fingal renowned in war! she cries, sons of the king, preserve me! Speak secure, replies the king, daughter of beauty, speak: our ear is open to all: our swords redress the injured. I fly from Ullin, she cries; from Ullin, famous in war. I fly from the embrace of him who would debase my blood. Cremor, the friend of men, was my father; Cremor the prince of Inverne. Fingal's younger sons arose; Carryl expert in the bow; Fillan beloved of the fair; and Fergus first in the race. Who from the farthest Lochlyn? who to the seas of Molochasquir? who dares hurt the maid whom the sons of Fingal guard? Daughter of beauty, rest secure; rest in peace, thou fairest of women. Far in the blue distance of the deep, some spot appeared like the back of the ridge-wave. But soon the ship increased on our sight. The hand of Ullin drew her to land. The mountains trembled as he moved. The hills shook at his steps. Dire rattled his armour around him. Death and destruction were in his eyes. His stature like the oak of Morven. He moved in the lightning of steel. Our warriors fell before him, like the field before the reapers. Fingal's three sons he bound. He plunged his sword into the fair one's breast. She fell as a wreath of snow before the sun in spring. Her bosom heaved in death; her soul came forth in blood. Oscur my son came down; the mighty in battle descended. His armour rattled as thunder; and the lightning of his eyes was terrible. There, was the clashing of swords; there, was the voice of steel. They struck and they thrust; they digged for death with their swords. But death was distant far, and delayed to come. The sun began to decline; and the cowherd thought of home. Then Oscur's keen steel found the heart of Ullin. He fell like a mountain oak covered over with glistering frost: He shone like a rock on the plain. Here the daughter of beauty lieth; and here the bravest of men. Here one day ended the fair and the valiant. Here rest the pursuer and the pursued. Son of Alpin! the woes of the aged are many: their tears are for the past. This raised my sorrow, warrior; memory awaked my grief. Oscur my son was brave; but Oscur is now no more. Thou hast heard my grief, O son of Alpin; forgive the tears of the aged. VII. [Why openest thou afresh the spring of my grief] Why openest thou afresh the spring of my grief Why openest thou afresh the spring of my grief, O son of Alpin, inquiring how Oscur fell? My eyes are blind with tears; but memory beams on my heart. How can I relate the mournful death of the head of the people! Prince of the warriors, Oscur, my son, shall I see thee no more! He fell as the moon in a storm; as the sun from the midst of his course, when clouds rise from the waste of the waves, when the blackness of the storm inwraps the rocks of Ardannidder. I, like an ancient oak on Morven, I moulder alone in my place. The blast hath lopped my branches away; and I tremble at the wings of the north. Prince of the warriors, Oscur, my son! shall I see thee no more! Dermid and Oscur were one: They reaped the battle together. Their friendship was strong as their steel; and death walked between them to the field. They came on the foe like two rocks falling from the brows of Ardven. Their swords were stained with the blood of the valiant: warriors fainted at their names. Who was a match for Oscur but Dermid? and who for Dermid, but Oscur? They killed mighty Dargo in the field; Dargo before invincible. His daughter was fair as the morn; mild as the beam of night. Her eyes, like two stars in a shower: her breath, the gale of spring: her breasts, as the new-fallen snow floating on the moving heath. The warriors saw her, and loved; their souls were fixed on the maid. Each loved her as his fame; each must possess her or die. But her soul was fixed on Oscur; my son was the youth of her love. She forgot the blood of her father; and loved the hand that slew him. Son of Oscian, said Dermid, I love; O Oscur, I love this maid. But her soul cleaveth unto thee; and nothing can heal Dermid. Here, pierce this bosom, Oscur; relieve me, my friend, with thy sword. My sword, son of Morny, shall never be stained with the blood of Dermid. Who then is worthy to slay me, O Oscur, son of Oscian? Let not my life pass away unknown. Let none but Oscur slay me. Send me with honour to the grave, and let my death be renowned. Dermid, make use of thy sword; son of Morny, wield thy steel. Would that I fell with thee! that my death came from the hand of Dermid! They fought by the brook of the mountain, by the streams of Branno. Blood tinged the silvery stream, and curdled round the mossy stones. Dermid the graceful fell; fell, and smiled in death. And fallest thou, son of Morny, fallest thou by Oscur's hand! Dermid invincible in war, thus do I see thee fall!—He went, and returned to the maid whom he loved; returned, but she perceived his grief. Why that gloom, son of Oscian? what shades thy mighty soul? Though once renowned for the bow, O maid, I have lost my fame. Fixed on a tree by the brook of the hill, is the shield of Gormur the brave, whom in battle I slew. I have wasted the day in vain, nor could my arrow pierce it. Let me try, son of Oscian, the skill of Dargo's daughter. My hands were taught the bow: my father delighted in my skill. She went. He stood behind the shield. Her arrow flew and pierced his breast. Blessed be that hand of snow; and blessed thy bow of yew! I fall resolved on death: and who but the daughter of Dargo was worthy to slay me? Lay me in the earth, my fair one, lay me by the side of Dermid. Oscur! I have the blood, the soul of the mighty Dargo. Well pleased I can meet death. My sorrow I can end thus.— She pierced her white bosom with steel. She fell; she trembled; and died. By the brook of the hill their graves are laid; a birch's unequal shade covers their tomb. Often on their green earthen tombs the branchy sons of the mountain feed, when mid-day is all in flames, and silence is over all the hills. VIII. [By the side of a rock] By the side of a rock on the hill By the side of a rock on the hill, beneath the aged tree, old Oscian sat on the moss; the last of the race of Fingal. Sightless are his aged eyes; his beard is waving in the wind. Dull through the leafless trees he heard the voice of the north. Sorrow revived in his soul: he began and lamented the dead. How hast thou fallen like an oak, with all thy branches round thee! Where is Fingal the king? where is Oscur my son? where are all my race? Alas! in the earth they lie. I feel their tombs with my hands. I hear the river below murmuring hoarsely over the stones. What dost thou, O river, to me? Thou bringest back the memory of the past. The race of Fingal stood on thy banks, like a wood in a fertile soil. Keen were their spears of steel. Hardy was he who dared to encounter their rage. Fillan the great was there. Thou Oscur wert there, my son! Fingal himself was there, strong in the grey locks of years. Full rose his sinewy limbs; and wide his shoulders spread. The unhappy met his arm, when the pride of his wrath arose. The son of Morny came; Gaul, the tallest of men. He stood on the hill like an oak! his voice was like the streams of the hill. Why reigneth alone, he cries, the son of the mighty Corval? Fingal is not strong to save; he is no support for the people. I am strong as a storm in the ocean; as a whirlwind on the hill. Yield, son of Corval; Fingal, yield to me. He came like a rock from the hill, resounding in his arms. Oscur stood forth to meet him; my son would meet the foe. But Fingal came in his strength, and smiled at the vaunter's boast. They threw their arms round each other; they struggled on the plain. The earth is ploughed with their heels. Their bones crack as a boat on the ocean, when it leaps from wave to wave. Long did they toil; with night, they fell on the sounding plain; as two oaks, with their branches mingled, fall crashing from the hill. The tall son of Morny is bound; the aged overcame. Fair with her locks of gold, her smooth neck, and her breasts of snow; fair, as the spirits of the hill when at silent noon they glide along the heath; fair, as the rainbow of heaven; came Minvane the maid. Fingal! she softly saith, loose me my brother Gaul. Loose me the hope of my race, the terror of all but Fingal. Can I, replies the king, can I deny the lovely daughter of the hill? Take thy brother, O Minvane, thou fairer than the snow of the north! Such, Fingal! were thy words; but thy words I hear no more. Sightless I sit by thy tomb. I hear the wind in the wood; but no more I hear my friends. The cry of the hunter is over. The voice of war is ceased. IX. [Thou askest, fair daughter of the isles!] Thou askest, fair daughter of the isles! Thou askest, fair daughter of the isles! whose memory is preserved in these tombs? The memory of Ronnan the bold, and Connan the chief of men; and of her, the fairest of maids, Rivine the lovely and the good. The wing of time is laden with care. Every moment hath woes of its own. Why seek we our grief from afar! or give our tears to those of other times? But thou commandest, and I obey, O fair daughter of the isles! Conar was mighty in war. Caul was the friend of strangers. His gates were open to all; midnight darkened not on his barred door. Both lived upon the sons of the mountains. Their bow was the support of the poor. Connan was the image of Conar's soul. Caul was renewed in Ronnan his son. Rivine the daughter of Conar was the love of Ronnan; her brother Connan was his friend. She was fair as the harvest moon setting in the seas of Molochasquir. Her soul was settled on Ronnan; the youth was the dream of her nights. Rivine, my love! says Ronnan, I go to my king in Norway. A year and a day shall bring me back. Wilt thou be true to Ronnan? Ronnan! a year and a day I will spend in sorrow. Ronnan, behave like a man, and my soul shall exult in thy valour. Connan my friend, says Ronnan, wilt thou preserve Rivine thy sister? Durstan is in love with the maid; and soon shall the sea bring the stranger to our coast. Ronnan, I will defend: Do thou securely go. He went. He returned on his day. But Durstan returned before him. Give me thy daughter, Conar, says Durstan; or fear and feel my power. He who dares attempt my sister, says Connan, must meet this edge of steel. Unerring in battle is my arm: my sword, as the lightning of heaven. Ronnan the warrior came; and much he threatened Durstan. But, saith Euran the servant of gold, Ronnan! by the gate of the north shall Durstan this night carry thy fair one away. Accursed, answers Ronnan, be this arm if death meet him not there. Connan! saith Euran, this night shall the stranger carry thy sister away. My sword shall meet him, replies Connan, and he shall lie low on earth. The friends met by night, and they fought. Blood and sweat ran down their limbs as water on the mossy rock. Connan falls; and cries, O Durstan, be favourable to Rivine! And is it my friend, cries Ronnan, I have slain? O Connan! I knew thee not. He went, and he fought with Durstan. Day began to rise on the combat, when fainting they fell, and expired. Rivine came out with the morn; and, O what detains my Ronnan! She saw him lying pale in his blood; and her brother lying pale by his side. What could she say? what could she do? her complaints were many and vain. She opened this grave for the warriors; and fell into it herself, before it was closed; like the sun snatched away in a storm. Thou has heard this tale of grief, O fair daughter of the isles! Rivine was fair as thyself: shed on her grave a tear. X. [It is night] It is night; and I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms. It is night; and I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms. The wind is heard in the mountain. The torrent shrieks down the rock. No hut receives me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of winds. Rise, moon! from behind thy clouds; stars of the night, appear! Lead me, some light, to the place where my love rests from the toil of the chace! his bow near him, unstrung; his dogs panting around him. But here I must sit alone, by the rock of the mossy stream. The stream and the wind roar; nor can I hear the voice of my love. Why delayeth my Shalgar, why the son of the hill, his promise? Here is the rock, and the tree; and here the roaring stream. Thou promisedst with night to be here. Ah! whither is my Shalgar gone? With thee I would fly my father; with thee, my brother of pride. Our race have long been foes; but we are not foes, O Shalgar! Cease a little while, O wind! stream, be thou silent a while! let my voice be heard over the heath; let my wanderer hear me. Shalgar! it is I who call. Here is the tree, and the rock. Shalgar, my love! I am here. Why delayest thou thy coming? Alas! no answer. Lo! the moon appeareth. The flood is bright in the vale. The rocks are grey on the face of the hill. But I see him not on the brow; his dogs before him tell not that he is coming. Here I must sit alone. But who are these that lie beyond me on the heath? Are they my love and my brother? Speak to me O my friends! they answer not. My soul is tormented with fears. Ah! they are dead. Their swords are red from the fight. O my brother! my brother! why hast thou slain my Shalgar? why, O Shalgar! hast thou slain my brother? Dear were ye both to me! what shall I say in your praise? Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands; he was terrible in fight. Speak to me; hear my voice, sons of my love! But alas! they are silent; silent for ever! Cold are their breasts of clay! Oh! from the rock of the hill; from the top of the mountain of winds, speak, ye ghosts of the dead! speak, and I will not be afraid. Whither are ye gone to rest? In what cave of the hill shall I find you? No feeble voice is on the wind: no answer half-drowned in the storms of the hill. I sit in my grief. I wait for morning in my tears. Rear the tomb, ye friends of the dead; but close it not till I come. My life flieth away like a dream: why should I stay behind? Here shall I rest with my friends by the stream of the sounding rock. When night comes on the hill; when the wind is upon the heath; my ghost shall stand in the wind, and mourn the death of my friends. The hunter shall hear from his booth. He shall fear, but love my voice. For sweet shall my voice be for my friends; for pleasant were they both to me. XI. [Sad! I am sad indeed] Sad! I am sad indeed; nor small my cause of woe! Sad! I am sad indeed; nor small my cause of woe! Kirmor, thou hast lost no son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty. Connar the valiant lives; and Annir, the fairest of maids. The boughs of thy family flourish, O Kirmor! but Armyn is the last of his race. Dark is thy bed, O Daura! and deep thy sleep in the tomb. When shalt thou awake with thy songs? with all thy voice of music? Rise, winds of autumn, rise; blow upon the dark heath! streams of the mountains, roar! howl, ye tempests, in the top of the oak! walk through broken clouds, O moon! show by intervals thy pale face; bring to my mind that sad night, when all my children fell; when Arindel the mighty fell; when Daura the lovely failed; when all my children died. Daura, my daughter! thou wert fair; fair as the moon on the hills of Jura; white as the driven snow; sweet as the breathing gale. Arindal, thy bow was strong, thy spear was swift in the field: thy look was like mist on the wave; thy shield, a red cloud in a storm. Armor, renowned in war, came, and sought Daura's love; he was not long denied; fair was the hope of their friends. Earch, son of Odgal, repined; for his brother was slain by Armor. He came disguised like the son of the sea: Fair was his skiff on the wave; white his locks of age; calm his serious brow. Fairest of women, he said, lovely daughter of Armyn! a rock not distant in the sea, bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar. There Armor waiteth for Daura. I came to fetch his love. Come, fair daughter of Armyn! She went; and she called on Armor. Nought answered but the son of the rock. Armor, my love! my love! why tormentest thou me with fear? hear, son of Ardnart, hear: it is Daura who calleth thee! Earch the traitor fled laughing to the land. She lifted up her voice, and cried for her brother and her father. Arindel! Armyn! none to relieve your Daura! Her voice came over the sea. Arindel, my son, descended from the hill; rough in the spoils of the chace. His arrows rattled by his side; his bow was in his hand; five dark grey dogs attended his steps. He saw fierce Earch on the shore; he seized, and bound him to an oak. Thick fly the thongs of the hide around his limbs; he loads the wind with his groans. Arindel ascends the surgy deep in his boat, to bring Daura to the land. Armor came in his wrath, and let fly the grey-feathered shaft. It sung; it sunk in thy heart, O Arindel, my son! for Earch the traitor thou diedst. The oar is stopt at once; he panted on the rock, and expired. What is thy grief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother's blood! The boat is broken in twain by the waves. Armor plunges into the sea, to rescue his Daura, or die. Sudden a blast from the hill comes over the waves. He sunk, and he rose no more. Alone, on the sea-rock, my daughter was heard to complain. Frequent and loud were her cries; nor could her father relieve her. All night I stood on the shore. I saw her by the faint beam of the moon. Loud was the wind; and the rain beat hard on the side of the mountain. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak. It died away, like the evening breeze among the grass of the rocks. Spent with grief she expired. And left thee, Armyn, alone: gone is my strength in the war, and fallen my pride among women. When the storms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the waves on high; I sit by the sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock. Often, by the setting moon, I see the ghosts of my children. Half-viewless, they walk in mournful conference together. Will none of you speak in pity? They do not regard their father. XII. RYNO, ALPIN. Ryno. The wind and the rain are over The wind and the rain are over: calm is the noon of day. The clouds are divided in heaven. Over the green hills flies the inconstant sun. Red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill. Sweet are thy murmurs, O stream! but more sweet is the voice I hear. It is the voice of Alpin, the son of the song, mourning for the dead. Bent is his head of age, and red his tearful eye. Alpin, thou son of the song, why alone on the silent hill? why complainest thou, as a blast in the wood; as a wave on the lonely shore? Alpin. My tears, O Ryno! are for the dead; my voice for the inhabitants of the grave. Tall thou art on the hill; fair among the sons of the plain. But thou shalt fall like Morar; and the mourner shall sit on thy tomb. The hills shall know thee no more; thy bow shall lie in the hall unstrung. Thou wert swift, O Morar! as a roe on the hill; terrible as a meteor of fire. Thy wrath was as a storm of December. Thy sword in battle, as lightning in the field. Thy voice was like a stream after rain; like thunder on distant hills. Many fell by thy arm; they were consumed in the flames of thy wrath. But when thou returnedst from war, how peaceful was thy brow! Thy face was like the sun after rain; like the moon in the silence of night; calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid. Narrow is thy dwelling now; dark the place of thine abode. With three steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great before! Four stones, with their heads of moss, are the only memorial of thee. A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass which whistles in the wind, mark to the hunter's eye the grave of the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art low indeed. Thou hast no mother to mourn thee; no maid with her tears of love. Dead is she that brought thee forth. Fallen is the daughter of Morglan. Who on his staff is this? who is this, whose head is white with age, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step? It is thy father, O Morar! the father of none but thee. He heard of thy fame in battle; he heard of foes dispersed. He heard of Morar's fame; why did he not hear of his wound? Weep, thou father of Morar! weep; but thy son heareth thee not. Deep is the sleep of the dead; low their pillow of dust. No more shall he hear thy voice; no more shall he awake at thy call. When shall it be morn in the grave, to bid the slumberer awake? Farewell, thou bravest of men! thou conqueror in the field! but the field shall see thee no more; nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel. Thou hast left no son. But the song shall preserve thy name. Future times shall hear of thee; they shall hear of the fallen Morar. XIII. [Raise high the stones] Raise high the stones; collect the earth Raise high the stones; collect the earth: preserve the name of Fear-comhraic. Blow, winds, from all your hills; sigh on the grave of Muirnin. The dark rock hangs, with all its wood, above the calm dwelling of the heroes. The sea, with its foam-headed billow, murmurs at their side. Why sigh the woods, why roar the waves! They have no cause to mourn. But thou hast cause, O Diorma! thou maid of the breast of snow! Spread thou thy hair to the wind; send thy sighs on the blasts of the hills. They vanished like two beams of light, which fly from the heath in a storm: They sunk like two stars in a cloud when the winds of north arise. For thee weep the maids, Fear-comhraic, along the echoing hills. For thee the women weep, O Muirnin! chief of the wars of Erin. I see thee not, Fear-comhraic, on the hill; I see not Muirnin in the storms of ocean. Raise, raise the song, relate the tale. Descend ye years of other times. Diorma was the daughter of Connaid, the chief of a thousand shields. Diorma was among the maids, as the white flower among the heath. Her breast was like a white cloud in heaven. Her bosom like the top of a wave in a storm. Her hair was like smoke in the sun: her eye like the star of morn. Not fairer looks the moon from between two clouds, than the face of Diorma from between her locks. A thousand heroes loved the maid; the maid loved none but Fear-comhraic. He loved the maid; and well he might; fair among women was the daughter of Connaid. She was the light of his soul in danger; the strength of his arm in battle. Who shall deny me the maid, said Fear-comhraic, who, the fairest of women, Diorma? Hard must be his helm of steel, and strong his shield of iron. I deny her, said Muirnin, son of the chief of generous shells. My sword is keen, my spear is strong; the valiant yield to Muirnin. Come, then, thou son of Cormac, O mighty Muirnin, come! leave the hill of Erin, come on the foamy wave. Let thy ship, like a cloud, come over the storms of ocean. He came along the sea: his sails were like grey mist on the heath: long was his spear of ash; his shield like the bloody moon.—Aodan, son of Armclach, came; the youth of the gloomy brow. Rise, Fear-comhraic, rise thou love of the soft Diorma! fight, or yield the maid, son of the great Comhfeadan! He rose like a cloud on the hill, when the winds of autumn blow. Tall art thou, said Fear-comhraic, son of mighty Cormac; fair are thy cheeks of youth, and strong thy arm of war. Prepare the feast, and slay the deer; send round the shell of joy: Three days we feast together; we fight on the fourth, son of Cormac. Why should I sheath my sword, son of the noble Comhfeadan? Yield to me, son of battle, and raise my fame in Erin. Raise thou my tomb, O Muirnin! If Fear-comhraic fall by thy steel, place my bright sword by my side, in the tomb of the lonely hill. We fight by the noise of the stream, Muirnin! wield thy steel. Swords sound on helmets, sound on shields; brass clashes, clatters, rings. Sparkles buzz; shivers fly; death bounds from mail to mail. As leaps a stone from rock to rock; so blow succeeds to blow. Their eyes dart fire; their nostrils blow: they leap, they thrust, they wound. Slowly, slowly falls the blade of Muirnin, son of war. He sinks; his armour rings; he cries, Fear-comhraic, I die! And falls the bravest of men, the chief of Innisfhallin! Stretch wide the sail; ascend the wave, and bring the youth to Erin. Deep on the hills of Erin is the sigh of maids. For thee, my foe, I mourn: thou art the grief of Fear-comhraic. Rise ye winds of the sounding hill; sigh over the fall of Muirnin! Weep, Diorma, for the hero; weep, maid of the arms of snow; appear like the sun in rain; move in tears along the shore! Aodan saw the fall of Muirnin, and drew the sounding bow: The grey-winged arrow flew, and pierced the breast of Fear-comhraic. Aodan, said Fear-comhraic, where was the sword of war? where was the spear of thy strength, when thus thou hast slain Fear-comhraic? Raise, gloomy youth, raise thou our tombs! I will rest with the chief of Innisfhallin. Who is that on the hill, like a sun-beam in a storm? Who is that with the heaving breasts, which are like two wreaths of snow? Thy blue eyes roll in tears, thou daughter of mighty Connaid! Thy hair flies round thy temples, as the mist on the rocks of Ardven. Thy robe flows on the heath, daughter of grief, Diorma! He is fallen on the hill like a stream of light in a cloud. No more shall he hear thy voice like the sound of the string of music. The strength of the war is gone; the cheek of youth is pale. XIV. [Cuchulaid sat by the wall] Cuchulaid sat by the wall Cuchulaid sat by the wall; by the tree of the rustling leaf. His spear leaned against the mossy rock. His shield lay by him on the grass. Whilst he thought on the mighty Carbre, whom he slew in battle, the scout of the ocean came, Moran, the son of Fithil. Rise, Cuchulaid, rise! I see the ships of Garve. Many are the foe, Cuchulaid; many the sons of Lochlyn. Moran! thou ever tremblest; thy fears increase the foe. They are the ships of the desert of hills arrived to assist Cuchulaid. I saw their chief, says Moran, tall as a rock of ice. His spear is like that fir; his shield like the rising moon. He sat upon a rock on the shore, as a grey cloud upon the hill. Many, mighty man! I said, many are our heroes; Garve, well art thou named, many are the sons of our king. He answered like a wave on the rock; who is like me here? The valiant live not with me; they go to the earth from my hand. The king of the desert of hills alone can fight with Garve. Once we wrestled on the hill. Our heels overturned the wood. Rocks fell from their place, and rivulets changed their course. Three days we strove together; heroes stood at a distance, and feared. On the fourth, the king saith that I fell; but Garve saith, he stood. Let Cuchulaid yield to him that is strong as a storm. No. I will never yield to man. Cuchulaid will conquer or die. Go, Moran, take my spear; strike the shield of Caithbait which hangs before the gate. It never rings in peace. My heroes shall hear on the hill. ? XV. DUCHOMMAR, MORNA. Duchommar. Morna thou fairest of women Morna thou fairest of women, daughter of Cormac-Carbre! why in the circle of stones, in the cave of the rock, alone! The stream murmureth hoarsely. The blast groaneth in the aged tree. The lake is troubled before thee. Dark are the clouds of the sky. But thou art like snow on the heath. Thy hair like a thin cloud of gold on the top of Cromleach. Thy breasts like two smooth rocks on the hill, which is seen from the stream of Brannuin. Thy arms, as two white pillars in the hall of Fingal. Morna. Whence the son of Mugruch, Duchommar, the most gloomy of men? Dark are thy brows of terror. Red thy rolling eyes. Does Garve appear on the sea? What of the foe, Duchommar? Duchommar. From the hill I return, O Morna, from the hill of the flying deer. Three have I slain with my bow; three with my panting dogs. Daughter of Cormac-Carbre, I love thee as my soul. I have slain a deer for thee. High was his branchy head; and fleet his feet of wind. Morna. Gloomy son of Mugruch, Duchommar! I love thee not: hard is thy heart of rock; dark thy terrible brow. But Cadmor, the son of Tarman, thou art the sun of Morna! thou art like a sun-beam on the hill, in the day of the gloomy storm. Sawest thou the son of Tarman, lovely on the hill of the chace? Here the daughter of Cormac-Carbre waiteth the coming of Cadmor. Duchommar. And long shall Morna wait. His blood is on this sword. I met him by the mossy stone, by the oak of the noisy stream. He fought; but I slew him; his blood is on my sword. High on the hill I will raise his tomb, daughter of Cormac-Carbre. But love thou the son of Mugruch; his arm is strong as a storm. Morna. And is the son of Tarman fallen; the youth with the breast of snow! the first in the chace of the hill; the foe of the sons of the ocean! Duchommar, thou art gloomy indeed; cruel is thy arm to me. But give me that sword, son of Mugruch; I love the blood of Cadmor! [He gives her the sword, with which she instantly stabs him.] Duchommar. Daughter of Cormac-Carbre, thou hast pierced Duchommar! the sword is cold in my breast; thou hast killed the son of Mugruch. Give me to Moinie the maid; for much she loved Duchommar. My tomb she will raise on the hill; the hunter shall see it, and praise me. But draw the sword from my side, Morna; I feel it cold. ? [Upon her coming near him, he stabs her. As she fell, she plucked a stone from the side of the cave, and placed it betwixt them, that his blood might not be mingled with her's.] XVI. [Where is Gealchossa] Where is Gealchossa my love Where is Gealchossa my love, the daughter of Tuathal-Teachvar? I left her in the hall of the plain, when I fought with the hairy Ulfadha. Return soon, she said, O Lamderg! for here I wait in sorrow. Her white breast rose with sighs; her cheek was wet with tears. But she cometh not to meet Lamderg; or sooth his soul after battle. Silent is the hall of joy; I hear not the voice of the singer. Brann does not shake his chains at the gate, glad at the coming of his master. Where is Gealchossa my love, the daughter of Tuathal-Teachvar? Lamderg! says Firchios, son of Aydon, Gealchossa may be on the hill; she and her chosen maids pursuing the flying deer. Firchios! no noise I hear. No sound in the wood of the hill. No deer fly in my sight; no panting dog pursueth. I see not Gealchossa my love; fair as the full moon setting on the hills of Cromleach. Go, Firchios! go to Allad, the grey-haired son of the rock. He liveth in the circle of stones; he may tell of Gealchossa. Allad! saith Firchios, thou who dwellest in the rock; thou who tremblest alone; what saw thine eyes of age? I saw, answered Allad the old, Ullin the son of Carbre: He came like a cloud from the hill; he hummed a surly song as he came, like a storm in leafless wood. He entered the hall of the plain. Lamderg, he cried, most dreadful of men! fight, or yield to Ullin. Lamderg, replied Gealchossa, Lamderg is not here: he fights the hairy Ulfadha; mighty man, he is not here. But Lamderg never yields; he will fight the son of Carbre. Lovely art thou, O daughter of Tuathal-Teachvar! said Ullin. I carry thee to the house of Carbre; the valiant shall have Gealchossa. Three days, from the top of Cromleach, will I call Lamderg to fight. The fourth, you belong to Ullin, if Lamderg die, or fly my sword. Allad! peace to thy dreams!—sound the horn, Firchios! Ullin may hear, and meet me on the top of Cromleach. Lamderg rushed on like a storm. On his spear he leaped over rivers. Few were his strides up the hill. The rocks fly back from his heels; loud crashing they bound to the plain. His armour, his buckler rung. He hummed a surly song, like the noise of the falling stream. Dark as a cloud he stood above; his arms, like meteors, shone. From the summit of the hill he rolled a rock. Ullin heard in the hall of Carbre. ? THE SIX BARDS, A FRAGMENT. NOTE ON CROMA, Those extempore compositions were in great repute among succeeding bards. The pieces extant of that kind shew more of the good ear, than of the poetical genius of their authors. The translator has only met with one poem of this sort, which he thinks worthy of being preserved. It is a thousand years later than Ossian, but the authors seem to have observed his manner, and adopted some of his expressions. The story of it is this: Five bards, passing the night in the house of a chief, who was a poet himself, went severally to make their observations on, and returned with an extempore description of, night. The night happened to be one in October, as appears from the poem; and in the north of Scotland, it has all that variety which the bards ascribe to it, in their descriptions. Macpherson. FIRST BARD. Night is dull and dark, The clouds rest on the hills; No star with twinkling beam, No moon looks from the skies. I hear the blast in the wood, But distant and dull I hear it. The stream of the valley murmurs, Low is its murmur too. From the tree at the grave of the dead, The lonely screech-owl groans. I see a dim form on the plain, 'Tis a ghost! it fades, it flies; Some dead shall pass this way. From the lowly hut of the hill The distant dog is howling; The stag lies by the mountain-well, The hind is at his side; She hears the wind in his horns, She starts, but lies again. The roe is in the cleft of the rock: The heath-cock's head beneath his wing. No beast, no bird is abroad, But the owl, and the howling fox; She on the leafless tree, He on the cloudy hill. Dark, panting, trembling, sad, The traveller has lost his way; Through shrubs, through thorns he goes, Beside the gurgling rills; He fears the rock and the pool, He fears the ghost of the night. The old tree groans to the blast; The falling branch resounds. The wind drives the clung thorn Along the sighing grass; He shakes amid the night. Dark, dusky, howling is night, Cloudy, windy, and full of ghosts; The dead are abroad; my friends Receive me from the night. SECOND BARD. The wind is up on the mountain; The shower of the hill descends. Woods groan, and windows clap; The growing river roars: The traveller attempts the ford, He falls, he shrieks, he dies. The storm drives the horse from the hill, The goat and the lowing cow; They tremble as drives the shower, And look for the shade of the stall. The hunter starts from sleep in his lone hut, And wakes the fire decay'd; His wet dogs smoke around him: He stops the chink with heath. Loud roar two mountain streams, Which meet beside his booth. Sad on the side of the hill The wandering shepherd sits. The tree resounds above him. The stream roars down the rock. He waits the rising moon To lead him to his home. Ghosts ride on the storm to-night. Sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind, Their songs are of other worlds. The rain is past. The dry winds blow. Streams roar, and windows clap; Cold drops fall from the roof. I see the starry sky.— But the shower gathers again. Dark, dark is the western sky! Night is stormy, dismal, dark; Receive me, my friends, from the night. THIRD BARD. The winds still sound between the hills, And groan on the riven rocks: The firs fall from their place on high. The turfy hut is torn. The clouds divided fly o'er the sky, And shew the burning stars. The meteor (token of death) Flies sparkling through the gloom. It rests on the hills, it burns.—I see the fern, The dark rock, and fallen oak. What dead is that in his shroud, Beneath the tree by the stream? The waves dark tumble on the lake, And lash the rocky sides. The boat is brimful in the cove; The oars on the rocky tide. Sad sits a maid beneath a rock, And eyes the rolling stream: Her lover promised to come. She saw his boat, when it was light, on the lake. Is this his broken boat on the shore? Are these his groans on the wind? Hark! the hail rattles around, The flakes of snow descend. The tops of the hills are white. The stormy winds abate. Various is night and cold; Receive me, my friends, from the night. FOURTH BARD. Night is calm and fair; Blue, starry, and settled is night. The winds, with the clouds, are gone; They descend behind the hill. The moon is up on the mountains; Trees glister; streams shine on the rocks. Bright rolls the settling lake; Bright the stream of the vale. I see the trees overturned; The shocks of corn on the plain. The wakeful peasant rebuilds the sheaves, Or drives the beasts of the hills away. Calm, settled, and fair is night. Who comes from the place of the dead? That form in the robe of snow; These white arms, that hair of gold! The daughter of the chief of the people; She that lately fell! Come, let us view thee, maid; Thou that wert the desire of heroes! The blast drives the phantom away; White, and without form, it ascends the hill. The breezes drive the blue mist Over the narrow vale: Grey on the hill it ascends, And joins itself to the sky. Night is settled and calm, Blue, starry, bright with the moon. Receive me not, my friends, For lovely is the night. FIFTH BARD. Night is calm, but dreary; The moon in a cloud in the west. Slow moves that feeble beam Along the shady hill. The distant wave is heard; The stream dull murmurs on the rock. The cock is heard from the booth. More than half the night is passed. The housewife, groping in the gloom, Rekindles the settled fire. The hunter thinks it day, And calls his nimble dogs: He ascends the hill, And whistles the road away: A blast removes the cloud; He sees the starry plough of the north: Much of the night is to pass. He nods by the mossy stone. Hark! the whirlwind is in the wood; Low murmurs on the plain. 'Tis the army of the mighty dead Returning from the air! The moon rests behind the hill; The beam is still on the lofty rock; Long are the shades of the trees. But now 'tis dark over all. Night's dreary, silent, and dark! Receive me, my friends, from the night. SIXTH BARD. (THE CHIEF HIMSELF.) Let clouds rest on the hill, Spirits fly, and travellers fear; Let the winds of the wood arise, The sounding storm descend; Roar streams, and windows clap, And green-winged meteors fly; Rise the pale moon on the mountain, Or inclose her head in clouds; Night is alike to me, Blue, gloomy, or stormy the sky. Night flies, and her goblin crew, When morn is poured on the hills. Light returns from the gloom; But we return no more! Where are our chiefs of old? Where our kings of modern name? The fields whereon they fought are silent; Scarce their mossy tombs remain. We, too, shall be forgot; This lofty house shall fall: Our sons shall scarce see its ruins on the grass; And shall ask, Where dwelt our fathers? Raise the song, strike the harp; Send round the shell of joy. Suspend a hundred tapers on high. Maids and youths begin the dance. Some grey-lock'd bard be near, And sing the deeds of other times; Of kings renowned in Albion, Of chiefs we see no more. Thus pass the night, Till morn is grey in our hall: Then be the bow in hand, The dogs and youth of the chace. We ascend the hill with day, And rouse the flying deer. FIRST BARD. Night is dull and dark. The clouds rest on the hills. No star with green-trembling beam; no moon looks from the sky. I hear the blast in the wood; but I hear it distant far. The stream of the valley murmurs; but its murmur is sullen and sad. From the tree at the grave of the dead the long howling owl is heard. I see a dim form on the plain! It is a ghost! it fades, it flies. Some funeral shall pass this way: the meteor marks the path. The distant dog is howling from the hut of the hill. The stag lies on the mountain moss: the hind is at his side. She hears the wind in his branchy horns. She starts, but lies again. The roe is in the cleft of the rock; the heath-cock's head is beneath his wing. No beast, no bird is abroad, but the owl and the howling fox. She on a leafless tree; he in a cloud on the hill. Dark, panting, trembling, sad, the traveller has lost his way. Through shrubs, through thorns, he goes, along the gurgling rill. He fears the rock and the fen. He fears the ghost of night. The old tree groans to the blast; the falling branch resounds. The wind drives the withered burs, clung together, along the grass. It is the light tread of a ghost! He trembles amidst the night. Dark, dusky, howling, is the night, cloudy, windy, and full of ghosts! The dead are abroad! my friends, receive me from the night. SECOND BARD. The wind is up. The shower descends. The spirit of the mountain shrieks. Woods fall from high. Windows flap. The growing river roars. The traveller attempts the ford. Hark! that shriek! he dies! The storm drives the horse from the hill, the goat, the lowing cow. They tremble as drives the shower, beside the mouldering bank. The hunter starts from sleep, in his lonely hut; he wakes the fire decayed. His wet dogs smoke around him. He fills the chinks with heath. Loud roar two mountain streams which meet beside his booth. Sad on the side of a hill the wandering shepherd sits. The tree resounds above him. The stream roars down the rock. He waits for the rising moon to guide him to his home. Ghosts ride on the storm to-night. Sweet is their voice between the squalls of wind. Their songs are of other worlds. The rain is past. The dry wind blows. Streams roar, and windows flap. Cold drops fall from the roof. I see the starry sky. But the shower gathers again. The west is gloomy and dark. Night is stormy and dismal; receive me, my friends, from night. THIRD BARD. The wind still sounds between the hills; and whistles through the grass of the rock. The firs fall from their place. The turfy hut is torn. The clouds, divided, fly over the sky, and shew the burning stars. The meteor, token of death! flies sparkling through the gloom. It rests on the hill. I see the withered fern, the dark browed rock, the fallen oak. Who is that in his shroud beneath the tree, by the stream? The waves dark-tumble on the lake, and lash its rocky sides. The boat is brimful in the cove; the oars on the rocking tide. A maid sits sad beside the rock, and eyes the rolling stream. Her lover promised to come. She saw his boat, when yet it was light, on the lake. Is this his broken boat on the shore? Are these his groans on the wind? Hark! the hail rattles around. The flaky snow descends. The tops of the hills are white. The stormy winds abate. Various is the night, and cold; receive me, my friends, from night. FOURTH BARD. Night is calm and fair; blue, starry, settled is night. The winds, with the clouds, are gone. They sink behind the hill. The moon is up on the mountain. Trees glister; streams shine on the rock. Bright rolls the settled lake; bright the stream of the vale. I see the trees overturned; the shocks of corn on the plain. The wakeful hind rebuilds the shocks, and whistles on the distant field. Calm, settled, fair is night! Who comes from the place of the dead? That form with the robe of snow; white arms, and dark-brown hair! It is the daughter of the chief of the people: she that lately fell! Come, let us view thee, O maid! thou that hast been the delight of heroes! The blast drives the phantom away; white, without form, it ascends the hill. The breezes drive the blue mist, slowly, over the narrow vale. It rises on the hill, and joins its head to heaven. Night is settled, calm, blue, starry, bright with the moon. Receive me not, my friends, for lovely is the night. FIFTH BARD. Night is calm, but dreary. The moon is in a cloud in the west. Slow moves that pale beam along the shaded hill. The distant wave is heard. The torrent murmurs on the rock. The cock is heard from the booth. More than half the night is past. The housewife, groping in the gloom, rekindles the settled fire. The hunter thinks that day approaches, and calls his bounding dogs. He ascends the hill, and whistles on his way. A blast removes the cloud. He sees the starry plough of the north. Much of the night is to pass. He nods by the mossy rock. Hark! the whirlwind is in the wood! A low murmur in the vale! It is the mighty army of the dead returning from the air. The moon rests behind the hill. The beam is still on that lofty rock. Long are the shadows of the trees. Now it is dark over all. Night is dreary, silent, and dark; receive me, my friends, from night. THE CHIEF. Let clouds rest on the hills: spirits fly, and travellers fear. Let the winds of the woods arise, the sounding storms descend. Roar streams, and windows flap, and green-winged meteors fly! rise the pale moon from behind her hills, or inclose her head in clouds! night is alike to me, blue, stormy, or gloomy the sky. Night flies before the beam, when it is poured on the hill. The young day returns from his clouds, but we return no more. Where are our chiefs of old? Where our kings of mighty name? The fields of the battles are silent. Scarce their mossy tombs remain. We shall also be forgot. This lofty house shall fall. Our sons shall not behold the ruins in grass. They shall ask of the aged, “Where stood the walls of our fathers?” Raise the song, and strike the harp; send round the shells of joy. Suspend a hundred tapers on high. Youths and maids begin the dance. Let some grey bard be near me, to tell the deeds of other times; of kings renowned in our land, of chiefs we behold no more. Thus let night pass, until morning shall appear in our halls. Then let the bow be at hand, the dogs, the youths of the chace. We shall ascend the hill with day; and awake the deer. DEATH: A POEM. Come melancholy, soul-o'erwhelming power! Woe's sable child! sweet meditation come; Come, pensive gaited, from thy hermit cell, Brood wide o'er life, and all its transient joys, The noisy follies, and corroding strifes: Shut the pleas'd ear from harmony and song; And from the heart ensnaring voice of fame. They come, they come! I seem through fields to rove, Sacred to woe, where Sorrow, sable shade! Looks pensive to the uncomfortable ground. On the soft breezes die the doleful notes, And swell the soul with doleful harmony. O life! how many are thy sons? how few Pursue the paths of happiness, though here The goddess reigns acceptable to all? Enraptured in the solemn maze of thought, My soul is all attention; Fancy reigns, And spreads before my view the flower-like race Of mortals; folly, pride, and luxury, Enwrap them round, till Death, impartial, shall Deal the sure stroke, and seize the gasping prey. High from an iron car, the gloomy king Outstretches o'er the world his hagard eye. His jaws, wide parting, open to the fill Of sad oblivion—sable mantled shade! At the dark chink the undistinguish'd throng Enter, of maids, gay youths, and tottering age. In gloomy pomp, array'd before their king, Fear, grisly Terror, shivering Dismay, And cloud-envelop'd Horror, gloomy stand. When far before, by sable Fate empowered, With wanton glee, and fool-insnaring grace, A soft deluding fair disarms the strong, And throws the brave into the jaws of death. The sons of pride, her Happiness, but men Call her Intemp'rance, daughter of this age, Got on Prosperity, born on the banks Of ill-used Liberty, and nursed up By Plenty, Indolence, and Gallantry, By Looks lascivious, by luxurious Ease. Behind her comes Consumption—meagre ghost! With slow, weak, languid pace, and self-devour'd; Born drooping on a tedious flux of time, With pain deep loaden, sluggish flowing down: Then ulcers, swellings, apoplectic fits, Convulsive trances, fever scorching hot, The sage Physician—all a gloomy train! Their general parent follow; while grim Death, Wide-wasting Terror! shuts the dismal scene. Already from the noise of life remov'd, Does Damon seek the solitary shade, Woe's gloomy haunts? does Contemplation please The youthful soul, and love imbibing heart? Ah, no! far other cares the soul invade, Whelm the sad breast, and melt the tearful eyes. Still sighing youth! how languid, pale, and wan, Unsanguine, meagre, lifeless, loveless, sad? Here, through the desolated streets, the crowds, Half-naked, fly from home; and born in streams The young Doricles left his joy behind, The blooming Daphne! memory starts up Of former love, and now defenceless charms. He starts, he views, he flies; no dangers fright But those of Daphne: her he shivering found, Rock'd in the tottering hall; her azure eyes, Like two fair fountains, watered the plain Of roses on her cheek. He clasp'd her round, And bore, through death, the lovely prize away. Death, death might pity, could but death relent: The field appears, and joy begins to dawn; When from a tottering roof a fragment falls, And crush'd the lovely Daphne in his arms! How did Doricles stand aghast! How beat, With broken sighs, his sorrow-wounded breast! Still, still he grasps the dying innocent; Yet sweet in death, and lovely in decay. Death once felt pity, stretched his sable hand, Shook the high tow'r, and sunk him with the blow. Thus, when the younger bears the parent stork, On wearied pinions through the fluid air, Some greedy fowler wings the deathful shaft, And brings them lifeless, fluttering to the ground. A horrid form, in hell's deep track enchained By the Almighty hand, till wickedness Broke the firm cords, and loos'd the grisly fiend, With sounding pinions, riding on the air, Death's sable sister, withering Pestilence, Clang'd her black wings o'er earth. The nations die: The rich, the poor, the feeble, and the great, Promiscuous throng: here, in the hall of state, The wither'd monarch drops the wand of power: There drops the easy-blasted plume of pride; And wit, half-uttered, dies upon the tongue. The uplifted tool drops from the tradesman's hand: Himself out-stretched in death: his youthful spouse Cries, save us Heaven! It was the last she said, And drop'd, disfigured, in the jaws of death. Breathless the mother lies, while on her breast The child hangs weeping: there the blooming youth Stumbles to death; the father spreads his hands To save his son, and is enwrapt in fate. Hence desolation spreads the awful wing O'er kingdoms; thence shall rough brow'd Ruin reign O'er the dispeopled earth, and Wealth and Power, Pomp, Pleasure, Pageantry, the sister train Of Vanity, become the slaves of Death. Drear solitude he loves; while Memory, Officious recorder! brings to view The pleasing phantom of preterite joy: But Pain and Sorrow, sister twins, start up, And shew how weak, how feeble now! how chang'd From what he was: Death takes the hint, and comes; Ah! now he nods; eternal sleep o'erwhelms His eyes; his breath, short-panting, scarcely heaves His breast. But, hark! that sigh! the soul is fled; The mournful form sinks pale into the grave. Ah! what avail these sable flowing locks, The air of pride; the folly-moving tongue, That gaudy shell, and these deluding eyes, The graceful form, and fair ensnaring port? In vain sweet Delia rends her flowing locks, Or heaves her breast, or melts her azure eyes; In vain! relentless Death is never mov'd. No more that youthful blood shall circling rise, And, love-creative, warm that pallid corse; No more that wit will cheer the unthinking heart; And that shut eye will roll its airs no more. Now sad remembrance calls to Delia's view, These plays, these concerts, nightly masquerades; That love, that wit, these dear deluding smiles, Where Damon was, that cheer'd the raptur'd soul: But now no more! these fleeting joys are fled. Fond memory mourns, crush'd by a load of woe. Is Damon gone, and Delia left behind? Is Damon dead, and Delia feed on air? Dear hapless youth, thy Delia seems unkind, And hugs her life and you enwrapt in fate. Come, sable Death! thou ever gentle shade, Come, woe's kind soother, still the sting of grief, Enwrap the mournful mind, and triumph o'er, Or what is sweet on earth, or what can love, She said; grew pale, the blooming roses dy'd On her wan cheek; and now her shivering limbs Felt Death's chill hand. Involved in a cloud Or spicy breath, the soul, complaining, fled. Thus, in the valley, a sweet-smelling flower Exults, the blooming daughter of the spring, Till, blasted with the breath of the north, it bows, Droops, withers, dies, press'd in the jaws of death. O life-destroying, cannot beauty please, Imprint compassion on the rigid brow, And blunt the edge of fate? Ah! no; in vain Rolls the soft eye, forth-darting all its love; In vain shall tears bedew the rosy cheek, Or the world-firing snowy bosom heave: Pity, soft pity! dreads thy awful reign, And far from thee melts on the field of life. O Temperance divine, neglected fair! O ever-loving mate of happiness, Sweet nurse of virtue, mother of long days, Why fled? O mildness, from these iron times, Return, return, and save a sinking age; Sinew the arm effeminate, repulse Death in thy absence, until Nature, tir'd, Shall stoop the hoary head, and wish for sleep. Scarce from this doleful scene I turn my eye, When o'er the wounded mind new horrors rise. Disease and pain, these sable scouts of death, For ever sting the unhappy race of men. Hark! hear that cry dolorous, tun'd by Woe, That grates the ear! 'Tis sure the voice of Pain. How doleful! that desponding wretch, outstretch'd On torment's bed! He raves, he grins insane, He grasps and tears in madness! Reason flies; How fierce his looks! how loud he howls! But see How life low ebbs, and strength itself gives way! The silent shade prevails: How faint, how weak, How low that voice that once battalions shook With iron tone! how feeble is that arm Robust, that often foil'd his country's foe! But hear that groan! it seems the last farewell. Of life departing—All is calm, and he Inhiant, slumbers in eternal rest. So, should a shepherd find the lordly pride Of beasts asleep, he latent gives the wound. He starts, roars loud, and waves his angry mane; Falls, wallows, roars, and in a groan expires. O man! what is thy boast? A beauteous face? That soon is blasted. Strength itself decays. Strong is the foe, and all his allies strong. Ev'n Nature's self and elements combine With death, with force confederate. Hapless man! How fallen, fallen from that high estate Of innocence and love, thy prior boon: When Pleasure stretched the untainted wing O'er fields of bliss; where fair Content and Joy, With Meditation and Serenity, Led the eternal choir, and Virtue smil'd To see her children sport; when, far removed, Death pin'd in hell's deep bounds: But, oh the pow'r Of vile ambition, virtue-hated fiend! Heaven's changed to hell, and death to life preferr'd; Hatred to love, and vice to innocence; Content, and virtue, and serenity, Are chang'd to folly, woe, and gloomy thought. Escap'd from hell once, Discord gnashed her teeth, And roll'd her glaring eyes: the nations quake, Affrighted peace the sinful earth foregoes, And truth is gone: Death recognised the sign, Smiles grimly, and begins to whet his shafts; Then o'er Hiberian floods, with mighty noise, Self-balanced, through midheaven wings his way, Eager for war. The affrighted waves subside, And with retreating hosts invade the earth: Earth dreads, and shivers from her inmost womb; Her mountains tremble, and her rough rocks fall Thundering along the ground; while through the chink Flames subterraneous flash, smoke wraps the sky, Domes throw their stately towers to earth; men groan, Torn in the jaws of death; half-stiffl'd cries Of suffocated infants, from the embrace Of cold maternal arms, invade the ear. Nor are these only foes to hapless man: Man, man himself is still his greatest foe! Man first brought death; and man pursues the trade, And by themselves unhappy mortals die. War, man destroying, on an iron car, Death's eldest brother, scours along the world: Before, Contention brandishes her stings; Fear, pallid shade! and feet-compelling flight, Sit on his brow, and cloud-envelop'd Woe, With heavy steps, pursues the bloody king. Upborne on Death, and on the pride of kings, The frightful monster shakes the solid tow'rs Of state, and nations at one morsel churns. See, on that field two gloomy hostile bands Frown terribly, in awful silence mute; While breathing winds sigh through the upright arms, And in each sigh a whispering sp'rit foretells The coward's fate. But, hark! the clarion sounds. Ah! see each phalanx gloomily incedes; They rush together! Gleaming arms afar Reflect the light; and dying groans, confus'd With iron clangour, wound the patient heart. See how they fall! This in his manly breast Receives the spear, and, groaning, falls in death: Through Damon's body glides the deathful shaft, And sinks him lifeless to the spreading arms Of sighing friends; here, through the parting skull, The shining blade descends; he, roaring, falls, Shakes the firm earth, and spreads his trembling limbs. Blood forms a lake around him; gasping life Heaves up the corse, and spurts the foaming blood. Thus, when the fisher hauls the finny prize To land, and throws it gasping on the shore, The dying fish his quivering body heaves, Dashing the watry relicks of the tide. See! bright in arms, along the iron field The stately young Philanthes drives the foe; No thirst of fame, no lion-hearted thought Prompts on the youth—nought but his country's love. Hear how they groan! what deaths his conquering arm Pours down, impetuous, on the fright'ned foe! But, ah! surrounded in the fierce embrace Of men, in vain he whirls the shining blade. Ah, mangled! mangled! See! see how he falls! How his great soul, her loved associate rears Reluctant, window'd; feeble for the weight Of foul mortality, the spirit flies. Yet wing'd to life, she cries, Save, Heavens save! Save! save my country, was the last he said. The young Lysander saw his brother fall, And sorrow spread a cloud around his eyes. Save, save Philanthes! save, my brother save! Relent, O foe! relent, and spare the youth! But, if soft pity melts not in your breasts, Turn, turn your shafts; pierce, pierce Lysander! pierce The unhappy brother! this the boon I crave. He said; he leap'd, he rushed, he sweeps along Amidst the embattled throng; there, there he raves O'er hills of slain, till, overpower'd by fate, He breathless falls, and grasps Philanthes' corse. Not death itself could quench fraternal love. So, when her whelps the furious lioness Views dying, roaring, 'midst the hunter throng, She furious rolls her angry eyes; then leaps Undaunted, tearing; but at length she falls By strokes redoubl'd, 'midst her gasping young. What tuneful woe invades my raptured ear, Borne on the sighing breeze? but when a blast Hoarse whistling howls, the moving accents die. 'Tis fair Miranda for her Anthes sighs. Anthes! the pride of all Britannia's sons, T'assert his monarch's sinking rights, is borne On floating forts, the terror of his foes. Ye blustering winds and hoarse resounding main, Ye storms, ye tempests, and death-winged bolts, Save, save the lovely youth, and pity me! Ye zephyrs bland, waft Anthes to the shore; Restore him blooming to my longing arms! Ah, no! Britannia, with superior charms, Detains the youth. Ah! Glory, Fame, and War, And hell-descended Discord, perish all, Sink in Oblivion's womb! and let sweet Love Triumph, soft tyrant! o'er the pleased world. Now rosy Shame, call'd up by modesty And thoughts of worth, supports her tuneful voice, And paints the cheek with beauty's fairest bloom. Now on the bosom of the sounding main Two fleets, with brazen prows, white billows plough; The bending mast low struggles with the wind, And quivering billows lash the oaken sides. They come; the sternly-looking chiefs command: The battle joins, and cannon from each side From their wide entrails breath the burning bolts. Loud thunders roar; men groan; the cordage crack; The wounded vessels reel from shore to shore; Old ocean trembles; and fraternal shades To frighten'd Neptune seem a kind recess. Jove calls his thunder, thinking that the sons Of earth, again rebellious, strove to rise With rival bolts; again he hears the noise; Again he calls: again Olympus shook; Heaven quakes; seas belch; the trembling earth concuss'd By circumambient ocean, cries of men, Torn in Death's jaws, incessant wound the air. Now through the breaches pours the briny tide, And weighs to death the vessels and the men; Some rear the head above the watery plain, And cry for help; but, ah! no help is near; Then sink in night: another stems the tide With brawny arms, he seeks the distant shore; Then wearied, breathless, droops the tardy limbs, And seeks for rest, e'en in the arms of death! The young Alethes grasps a broken mast, And steers, half hoping, to the friendly sand: All night he steered, and with the dawning morn The land emerges from a sea of clouds. While sage Iphthima press'd the higher strand, And looks attentive o'er the rolling flood; This way and that she cast her longing eyes, If or a boat, or sea-dividing ship, Brought news of her Alethes; him she saw, Half-naked, leaning on a foaming jaw. Ah me! my son, my Alethes, my dear, Joy of my youth, dear object of my woe! Come, come, my dear! press, press my son to land! What fate, what cruel fate, what more than death Has laid my son incumbent on a wave? Here, here my hand! Stretch, stretch, my son, thy arm! Thus she, outstretching o'er the foaming tide, When a rough whirlwind sweeps along the main, And plunged him headlong in the gulphy deeps: Thrice he upraised his head; and thrice he sunk In death, and thrice the circling eddies bell'd: The fourth up-springing, Mother, mother! dear Author of life, farewell! A wave supprest His voice, and sunk him to the mighty dead. Thus water-fowl upon the sable flood, Now here, now there, their floating bodies shew, But then are lost amidst the sounding foam, And empty billows dash the yellow sand. O Discord! gnashing fury, rav'nous fiend, Hell's sharpest torment, nauseous qualm of life! You bathe the poinard oft in Friendship's breast! Peace, Virtue, Friendship, Harmony, and Love, Delightful train of graces! shrink from thee; Vice, Envy, Villany, deceitful thoughts, Blood-thirsty Cruelty, insatiate Pride, War, woe of mothers and new-married maids! Attend thy shrine; and thence long plighted leagues And unity are broke; thence streams of blood Flow from the patriot's honest-thinking heart; And rapine, bloodshed, carnage, train of Death! Resistless, restless, tear the unhappy world. Fly, fly foul fiend! and leave the mangled world, Too long thy prey. Ah me! shall hapless men For ever, ever feel thy iron rod? Come Peace, come life-befriending, lovely fair! A thousand graces 'tend thy placid reign: Stretch the soft pinions o'er a happy world; Snatch the sharp weapon from the warrior's hand, And chace the jarring monster down to hell. Let Science raise on high her drooping head, And Muses tune the soul-delightful lay. In vain the poet glides in melting strains, In vain attunes his soul to tuneful woe; Deaf is the jar of Discord, dim the eye Of War, and Happiness far flies the earth. Come Contemplation, then, my lovely fair! Solemnly walking, unaffected grace! Absorpt from life, I join thy sable train, And turn my aching eye from dismal war. Hear how Palæmon, from his humble bed, Palæmon! whom twice fifty winters bend, Pale, to the tomb; Vice, with her iron hand, Ne'er gloomed his days, that innocently flow'd, With mind serene, and aspect all composed, Breathes virtue in each word, and paves the way To sweet felicity in heaven and earth: While mournful, near, the consort of his love. Droops the sad eye, and fair Lavinia's cheeks Lie, rosy, drown'd in tears; paternal love Melts the young heart, and pours the briny tears. With mournful look, and with attentive ear, Near to his father's bed, Acasto stands, And drinks large draughts of virtue. Now the soul Flutters, to meet the untainted minds above. Death, sable shade! with silent awful step Approaches gentle, and o'erwhelms his eyes; He nods, and falls asleep, when on his tongue The word, half-uttered, dies. So, in the noon Of night, the crying babe the officious nurse Sooths with half-sleeping sounds; when to repose The innocent is lull'd, the song shall die, Imperfect, on her sleep suspended tongue. Solemnly slow, along the mournful plain, The melancholy croud support the corse Of young Philætes, snatched, in early bloom Of youth, from life, and all its fading joys. Outstretched, in the sable-mantled dome, Sleep reason, virtue, beauty, sweetness, youth, All, all that man can boast, now withered lie. Behind, with trembling steps, the hoary age Of old Philanthes mourns; a staff supports His tottering feet: he droops his silvered head; And tears run trickling down his pallid cheeks. He now and then looks to the sable hearse, And all his soul's oppress'd with mighty woes, And from his faultering tongue these accents break. Ah me! my son, ah, comfort of my age! My only son, supporter of our house! Ah! why, Philætes, have you left your sire, Struggling with age, and soul-corroding woe! Why sunk in death the sun that brightly shone On th' evening of my days! Almighty power, Thine is the world—whate'er Thou wilt is done: Thine is the young, and he that bows with age; And whom Thou wilt thou call'st! Why then repine? Death ne'er too soon enwraps the good: short life Well spent is age, and not the hoary head. Thus he. The sad attendance sigh'd; but chief The young Acanthes gave to mighty woe His manly mind. Not blood, with all its streams, Could form such ties as bound him to his friend; Their age, their thoughts, their words, their deeds, the same; To virtue form'd alike their youthful souls. The sun descending to the western waves, Shot parallel to earth his evening ray, And lines the virid hills with fusile gold. To sigh for lost Philætes, through the field Acanthes strays, and views the pleasing scene, Where oft he with his dear Philætes roam'd. Deep sorrow veils, with pearly drops, his eye, And from his heaving breast these accents break: Sleep'st thou for ever, O, my darling friend, My other self! Has death for ever seal'd The friendly eye, and bound the tuneful tongue? Ah me! no parting word has blest thy friend; No token of our spotless friendship left! But I, alone, unfriended, sad, forlorn, Shall mourn thy absence in this vale of tears. He said, when through the field Philætes step'd: A heavenly beauty, and unfading youth, Flush'd in his cheeks, and sparkled from his eyes; A snowy robe, in wreathy volumes, flowed Down from his shoulders, and his golden hair Play'd in the murmuring breeze. Ambrosia sheds Its pleasing vapours on the ambient air. He came, he spoke, and smiled upon his friend, And melody drops from his youthful tongue. Thine is the youth, and he that bows with age; And whom Thou wilt, Thou call'st. Why then repine? Death ne'er too soon enwraps the good; short life Well spent is age, and not the hoary head. But, ah! fond nature for Philætes mourns. Why name Philætes, now my greatest woe, Though once the comfort of my drooping mind! Dear hapless youth! for thee my bosom sighs. And shall till Death enwrap me to his reign. Thus he. The sad attendance sigh'd; but chief The young Andræmon gave to silent woe His manly mind: not blood, with all its streams, Could so attach Andræmon to his friend; Their age, their thoughts, their actions, words the same, To virtue formed alike their youthful souls. Whether the sun sports in the fields of light, Or gloomy night her sable mantle throws O'er sleeping earth, still imaged to the mind Of young Andræmon is his darling friend. Still sighs the breast, still melts the tearful eye, Still flows the soul in elegies of woe. The rocks, the plains, the woods, the pleasing scenes Where he and young Philætes raptured, pray'd, And talked of virtue, echo to his moan. Sleep'st thou for ever, O my darling friend! My other self! has death for ever seal'd The friendly eye, and bound Philætes' tongue? Ah me! no parting look has blest thy friend, No token of our spotless friendship left; From me removed, you breathed the spotless soul. Now I, alone, unfriended, sad, forlorn, Must mourn your absence in this vale of tears, Till death, with sable hand, shall quench this pain, And still the dire commotions of the breast. He said—'twas night, and solemn silence reign'd Throughout the plain; no voice, no sound is heard, But now and then the breathing breezes sigh Through the half-quivering leaves, and, far removed, The sea rolls feeble murmurs to the shore; The birds hang, sleeping, on the bending sprigs, And setting Luna gave a silver gleam. THE HUNTER: A POEM. IN TEN CANTOS. CANTO I. Once on a time, when Liberty was seen To sport and revel on the northern plain, Immortal fair! and was supremely kind On Scotia's hills to snuff the northern wind; There lived a youth, and Donald was his name. To chace the flying stag his highest aim; A gun, a plaid, a dog, his humble store; In these thrice happy, as he wants no more. The flesh of deer his food; the heath his bed; He slept contented in his tartan plaid. Sprightly as morn he rose with dawning light, And strode o'er hills until the approach of night; Then bounding homeward, joyful burden bears Of heath-hens, woodcocks, or of fearful deers. Then Bessy gets upon the homely board What Donald's gun and oaten field afford. Blest in the chace, blest in his barren soil, And more than happy in his temperate toil, Our Donald lived; but, oh! how soon the light Of happiness is sunk in blackest night! It chanced the Fairie's king a daughter had, A beauteous, blooming, and a sportive maid. She took delight, upon the flowery lawn To frisk, transported, round a female fawn. The hunter aims the tube: the powder flies; The fawn falls, roars, and shakes her limbs, and dies. The blooming Flavia saw her play-thing die; Sighs rend her breast, and tears bedew her eye, Wrath, sorrow, rage, her tender fabric rock, And thus, indignant, she the silence broke: “Ah me! what frailties fairies' nature owe, The sport of every blast that likes to blow: One blast of Boreas, whistling o'er the hill, Shall drive the stoutest headlong half a mile; The rain, the rattling hail, deep wounds impress, Which two warm summers scarcely can redress. Not only these, but man, our greatest foe, Vile, rough-spun creature, minister of woe! Scarce Flavia loves a deer upon the vale, E'er torn by dogs, or by the winged ball, Her darling falls. Ah me! my little fawn, How oft with thee I sported on the lawn, But shall no more: but what thy Flavia grieves, Her abject strength no hopes of vengeance gives. But stop! what nature does not still impart, May be amended by the wiles of art.” She spoke—The eddying whirlwind sweeps the skies: Borne on a blast, the fleeting Flavia flies. Clods, dust, and straws, in one confusion fly, And trembling atoms mingle with the sky. A hill there is, whose sloping sides of green Are by the raptured eye at distance seen; Rocks intersperse the variegated space: Here columns rise; there smiles the virid grass; There timid deers, and shaggy goats abound; There tripping fairies dance the fleeting round; Within the king of fairies makes abode, And waves o'er prostrate crowds his regal rod: A sea-green throne his royal limbs support, Full in the middle of the spacious court. His furrowed front majestic he uprears; His waving locks are silvered o'er with years. Upon the wall, supply the want of day, Arranged lamps, that dart a glimmering ray. Unhallowed viands on the table stand, The unblest produce of the neighbouring land. Old Murdock plow'd: an ox died in the yoke; And here his tumid limbs in cauldrons smoke. The maid, the youth, the matron, and the sage, The call of craving hunger all assuage: While, clad in woe, the lovely Xanthe comes, And lightens with her charms the shady rooms. All start—The monarch tumbles from his throne. Why weeps my daughter? why that tender moan? Why, why that sigh, my dear? the parent cries, What sorrow veils thy beauty-sparkling eyes? Parent and king, replies the faultering maid, The little fawn, my pretty fawn, is dead! Her Donald slew, and I am left alone; A wretched princess, now my fawn is gone. Come, then, my parent, visionary king! Some vengeance due upon the murderer bring. Wing with revenge each ill-chastising art, Or hear the bursting of a daughter's heart. The king commands; the reverend senate meet, And first Euchenor rises from his seat. With graceful air, solemnly slow, he rose; Down to his heel the light green mantle flows. He paused, then coughed; the vaulted grotto rung, And from their seats the attentive peerage hung. Then thus: O thou, unlimited in sway! Whom all the fairy-phantom crowds obey, Whether they glide in undistinguish'd night, Or sport, self-balanced, in the fields of light; Still cheerful, ready at thy great command, They skim o'er seas, or trip o'er desert land. 'Tis mine the blooming Xanthe to console, That share thy banquet, and that quaff thy bowl. In vain shall myriads, hovering on the wing, Even though directed by their godlike king, Assault the hunter; his firm limbs deride Embattled squadrons, ranged side by side. It is not ours to try by strength, but art, To foil the body, but to wound the heart. Once on a time, when youth my bosom warm'd, By the Cerulean sky and zephyrs charm'd, I strayed through fields of air; intent I view Fields, cities, trees, and men, a beavy'd crew. Content upon the green the peasant lives, While damn'd in courts of state the courtier grieves; For power, for grandeur, pours the eternal pray'r, Wakes sleepless nights, and yawns whole days of care. Should some foe-fairy glide through fields of light, And to the regal seat direct his flight, Take the black humour, boiling round the brain, Then, soft-transported, seek the northern plain; Around the hunter the black humour shed, And fill, with vile ambition, all his head; Then, damn'd to care, the deer-destroying man Shall rue the slaughter of the bounding fawn. The motion pleased; applause from every side Pours on the senator its sounding tide. Young Xanthe mov'd; a robe of sprightly green, In amorous folds, to grasp her waste is seen; A bongrace does her lovely forehead shade, Soft wave behind the honours of the head. A fan her hand, her feet bright sandals grace; And beauty wanders in her blooming face. She mounts; around her soft-wing'd zephyrs fly, Kiss her white limbs, and waft her through the sky. On downy tracts of air the fairy glides, And all the north hill shaded, backward slides. Thus on the main, when favouring zephyr sings Through the swift frigate's wide extended wings, Ports, rocks, and cities, seem to glide away, And the cloud-wounding hills themselves decay. On rocks a city stands, high-tower'd, unwall'd, And from its scite the hill of Edin call'd, Once the proud seat of royalty and state, Of kings, of heroes, and of all that's great; But these are flown, and Edin's only stores Are fops, and scriveners, and English'd whores. Here blooming Xanthe slopingly descends, And, softly lighting, all her journey ends. Invisible; for Fergus' Scottish line, Disdain'd not yet on barren fields to reign. The hours through half his journey drove the day. While slumbering yet the hiant Meno lay, Fair Xanthe entered; round his pillow shed Sleep-deep'ning air, and fum'd his dizzy head. He snored aloud; the palace thundered round, And repercussive walls repel the sound. She took a knife, a deep incision made, Then healed the wound, and with the humour fled. Zephyr again resumed his lovely load, And through the plains of ether with her trode. Arrived, the vision round the hunter shed, And filled with wild ambition all his head. CANTO II. In Donald's eye now fade the blissful scenes: The rough brow'd rocks, the sloping hills and plains, Delight no more; no chace, no winged fowl, No goat, no cattle, cheer the troubled soul; The hut is hateful, and the fields of corn Contract their bounds, and promise no return. All is one blank—O envy'd, envy'd state, The hunter cries, of all the happy great! While press'd in poverty's hard iron hand, I force poor sustenance from barren land, Remote from life, and curs'd by fate unkind, To struggle on the hill with northern wind, Secure, in stately halls, the feast they ply, And swim through life in deluges of joy. The hut, the heathy wild, the barren fold, The rattling hail, the north-descended cold, Is all my portion—all a swain can boast, Still 'twixt vicissitude's rough billows toss'd. O partial Heavens! O Providence unkind! Mine is the well-strung arm, the feeling mind; Yet scarce can wade through miseries of life, Combat with care, with care in endless strife. O why, ye Powers, not bless me with a mind To all the blasts of poverty resigned, Or bless me greatly with the affluent store, Nor doom the hapless hunter to be poor? But why this moan? Thus always to complain Suits only women, worthless 'tis in men: Why thus repine! why thus for ever grieve! I am but young, 'tis time enough to live; Youth, sprightly bloom! the prize is still in view: Rise, hunter, rise, and happiness pursue. Thus on the hilly surface of the heath The dog pursues the hare, and gasps for breath; Unfainting, eager, he devours the way, Till in his jaws he churns the quivering prey. Thus said, the mountaineer indignant rose; Around his limbs the spangled plaid he throws; About his waist the rough broad cincture flies; The plaid hangs plaited down his brawny thighs; Straight down his side the temper'd dagger hung; Athwart his thigh the sabre glides along; On his left breast he heaveth with his breath The polished pistol, minister of death! He snatched the tube, companion of his toil, Secured from rust by foxes furry spoil: Then bounding forward, he devours the way; The oaten fields, and low-roof'd hut decay; The hills slip backward, as the hunter strides Along the sharp spik'd rocks and mountain's sides. In sober majesty the silent night Advanced from the east, and drove before the light; While yet the hunter rattled through the heath, Moved the lithe limbs, and sigh'd with panting breath. A hill there is, which forms a sable wall Through all the north, and men it Grampus call. Here lean-cheek'd Barrenness terrific strides; A tattered robe waves round her iron sides; Two baleful eyes roll in her iron face; Her meagre hand supports a pile of grass; Her bare white skull no decent covering shews; Eternal tempests rattle on her brows; Lank-sided Want, and pale-eyed Poverty, And sharp-tooth'd Famine, still around her fly; Health-gotten Hunger, want-descended Pain, Vein-numbing Cold—are all her gloomy train. The hunter view'd; a shiv'ring tremour ran Through every vein, and vanquished all the man: Extended wide he lay upon the heath, And catch'd from zephyr to recruit his breath. Refreshed he rose, and levels with his eye The blue-tubed gun. Black deaths in lightning fly; A roe falls shrieking: her the hunter flead; The beast on heathy shrubs in order laid; Then struck the fire; the living sparkles fly, The flames ascend, and quiver in the sky. The flesh, surrounded by the wasteful fire, Buzz in the flames; the flames in smoke expire. And now the pangs of hunger drop their rage, His thirst the gently-flowing brooks assuage. Secure upon the bank his limbs he spread, And peaceful slumbers hover round his head. The night her sable car through half the plain Of heaven drove, and spread her silent reign; Her twinkling eyes the gloomy goddess shrouds With a dark veil of rain-condensed clouds; When, lo! before the sleeping hunter's eyes His father Malcolm's phantom seem'd to rise. Thin are the snowy honours of his head; An half-worn shroud waves round the long since dead. He slow advanced, his furrow'd visage shook, Then stretched his skinny hand, and thus he spoke: Why, why, my son! O, why, my only joy! Why from his house does youthful Donald fly? What wicked demon, enemy of rest, Has ruffled the smooth surface of your breast? Return, return! in vain you fly from Care, Sharp stings the gnawing monster every where. To shun him sailors vainly billows cleave; He sits incumbent on each sable wave. In vain through rugged earth incessant roam; Man is his prey, and everywhere his home. Him vile Ambition, in a foul embrace, Got on Corruption; ghastly is his face, Red are his wakeful eyes; around he stares, His form is rack'd with never ceasing fears. Face-wintering wrinkles on his cheeks he draws, And poison bubbles round his grinning jaws. He always looks, but never sees aright; Imagined phantoms swim before his sight. The shade of Want remote, and Poverty, Are figured out by the unfaithful eye. He starves in plenty, troubled is in rest, And sleep ne'er floats upon his boiling breast. Unseen, but felt, oft in the halls of state He sits, and tinges all the pompous treat. And oft he hovers round the downy bed, Thundering despair around the statesman's head, While happy, on the wide extended plain, The shepherd scarcely owns his rigid reign. What though no grandeur spreads his homely boards, Confined to what sweet temperance affords: No pride, with gaudy mazes, ever swims Around his ample chest and brawny limbs; Yet sweet Content anxiety beguiles, Triumphs o'er Care, and tempers life with smiles. Thus, in the dark recesses of the grove, The shrouded birds tune elegies of love; The walker listens to the tuneful lay, While unperceived the rough road steals away. Thus said, he fades before the hunter's sight, And the pale form is wrapt in gloomy night; Amidst the breeze the dying words are lost, And nought is heard but the shrill whistling blast. Aghast the hunter rose; soft sleep is fled; Upright stood all the honours of his head: He draws his sword, around a circle broke; Then blest the place, and to himself thus spoke: If in the wide expanses of the sky, On gloomy air departed spirits fly, Sure this was he, for yet I seem to hear, As yet his accents hang upon the ear. The well-known voice, the child-instructing tongue, Could to no shade but to my sire belong. The same his visage, and his shape the same; Thus sunk into the grave the ancient frame. But how be here? since fleeting spirits dwell, As parsons say, in heaven or in hell, Not wandering free, but still confined to space, To gulphs of sorrow, or to vales of peace, Unheedful, unconcerned for aught below, And blood created friendship cease to glow. For when the unharnessed soul is fled in breath, And the rough vessel sinks in gloomy death, Each earthly love, each blood-formed passion gone, The untainted soul shall love the soul alone. Cease, Donald cease, to be in endless pain For the wild fancy of thy dastard brain. 'Tis cowardice that raised the grisly shade, Described grim Care, and not thy father dead. Thus oft the trembling, easy frightened hind, Hears shrill dogs yelping in each blast of wind; His frighten'd fancy empty terrors sees, Makes dogs of stones, and men of distant trees. The Hunter argued thus, devoid of rest, Thus rolled the passions in his troubled breast: While sprightly morn, in spangled beauties clad, Reared o'er the eastern hill her rosy head; Cool through the heath the mattin breezes sigh, And wave the plaid on Donald's brawny thigh. Cheered with the blest return of sacred light, Eased of the gloomy terrors of the night, He stretched his limbs, and ceaseless metes the way, Till on the banks of clearly-flowing Tay The Hunter stood, where the rough bubbling flood Roars 'twixt two hills, through rocks and murmuring woods: Laid on the banks, the trees above him waved; His scrip provides what gnawing hunger craved. Refresh'd he rose, then plunged into the tide; The waves arose, and, bubbling, wash his sides; He gains the farther shore; then, with a bound, The Hunter rises: Showers descend around. Thus water-fowl their downy bodies lave In the bright bubbles of the silver wave; Then seek the shore, and clap the ruffled wing; Then through the air on well fledged pinions sing. Thus shook, thus fled the man, till setting day Darts parallel to earth his western ray. A place there is, where the cerulean main Glides up through earth, and forms an azure plain; The Hunter stood astonish'd, to survey The roaring billows on the watry way, How liquid mountains dash against the shore, The rough rocks rumble, while the billows roar. He stretched his limbs along the murmuring deep, And the hoarse billows lull his soul to sleep. CANTO III. While thus the wanderer pressed his sandy bed, And downy sleep sheds balm around his head, Destructive Care on sable pinion flies, And spreads his phantoms on the monarch's eyes. Fierce foes the throne of regal Scotia threat; The English thunder at the palace gate. The monarch starts, the reverend senate calls; The nobler peerage throng the royal halls. The king arose, his graceful visage shook, Then stretched his sceptre, and commanding spoke. Ye chiefs, ye heroes, ye professed foes Of hateful slavery and th' aspiring Rose, If on the iron field, incased in arms, Ye taught your foes that liberty had charms; If, dauntless chiefs! ye bore of generous toil, And met with death to save a barren soil; Now, now, O! generous lend the timely aid, And break the storm that threatens Scotia's head. This to our mother we, her children, owe; Our country's enemy is still our foe. Bleak Desolation, on her lonely wings, The foe through all the south terrific brings: And now, nocturnal, on the yellow sand, In sable walls the embattled English stand In close array. To-morrow they prepare To hurl against our walls the stormy war. Rise, Caledonian chiefs! ye heroes, rise! Your bleeding country for your succour cries. Thus in the iron field a father falls, And grasping his dear son, incessant calls, Revenge, my son, revenge my death! he cries. The son obeys—revenges, or he dies. The monarch said; the loyal chiefs obey, Their homage done, majestic strode away. His country's love each generous bosom warms; The streets resound with fight deciding arms. Before the camp they rest, till sacred light Inflame the soul, and teach the hands to fight. Dark night, involved in gloomy clouds, now fled; The sun o'er ocean reared his beamy head: In dazzling light the foaming billows roll'd, The sloping hills are lined with fusil gold. On sable pinions, from the Hunter's eyes Lid-bending sleep, cloud-mantled, silent flies. On downy gales the restful power is laid, Oblivious vapours fume his drowsy head. His half-shut eye all in confusion sees His matted hair remurmur in the breeze: His loose-thrown robe hangs careless round his limbs, Or in the gale in wreathy volumes swims. With downcast eyes, Oblivion, silent shade! In her dark bosom hugs his vapour'd head. Refresh'd, the Highlander uprightly stood, And views afar the silver-gilded flood; While in the port the loved sea-faring train Fit the tall bark to the rough murmuring main. He enters; to the sea the ship advanced, Plow'd through the waves, and on the billows danced. Cut by the prow, the foam inlaced tides Quiver astern, and lash the oaken sides: The murmuring north-west, with refreshing gales, Hoarse whistles through the shrouds, and swells the sails. Now on the eye the southern mountains grow, Lithæan towers advance, solemnly slow; While trumpets, clarions, noble shouts of war, With mingled sounds, invade the Hunter's ear. A noble ardour, never known till then, Swells on the blood, and boils in every vein: He more majestic moves; enlarged more, His soul accused the slow-coming shore. Arrived—he eager leaps upon the ground; His rattling arms emit an iron sound. With mighty strides he sweeps along the sand, And bends his footsteps to the lesser band. Thus in the lowly hut, the faithful hound, With tender twigs of yielding osier bound, When, far without, he hears the blasting horns, Leaps here and there, and in his bondage burns; But once let loose, he snuffs the gelid wind, And leaves the winged blast to puff behind. The youth arrived, when o'er the northern main The lovely form of Liberty is seen. A heavenly splendour, and unfading grace, Flashed from her eyes, and wandered in her face; Her lovely skin the varied beauty shews, Of the white lilly, and the blushing rose. Justice around her spreads her awful reign, And Innocence, in white robes, neatly plain, Smiles life away; when sweet Fidelity, With sister Modesty, completes the joy. There Science stands, in endless pleasure clad, Eternal laurels flourish on her head. Each Muse, a lovely choir! around her sings, And gnawing Care thére drops the pointless stings. Oppression, ghastly shade! her presence flies; The trembling tyrant veils his coward eyes, When clad in wrath, and law-maintaining arms, The goddess shines in more than mortal charms. Majestically slow descends the fair; Her snow-white robe swims on the placid air, And on the royal head conspicuous stood, With courage keen, and dauntless fortitude. She raised her voice; the rocks re-echo round; The embattled English tremble at the sound. Thrice call'd the power, and thrice the ocean rang, And from the starting horse the riders hang: When Courage, through the Scottish ranks confessed, With his immortal steel incased each breast. Each generous soul confess'd with ardent joy, I'll save my country, or revenged die. But more than all the youthful Hunter burns, Joy swells his breast, and vengeance stings by turns. Pain heaves his beating heart; his form, improved, Towers o'er the field, and as a god he moved. Terror, commixed with soul-attractive grace, Flashed from each feature of his manly face. CANTO IV. And now the war-inciting clarions sound, And neighing coursers paw the trembling ground. At once they move, majestically slow, To pour their headlong force upon the foe; Then stop, and, awful, solemn silence reigns, Along the sable walls, and frowning plains. When, wrapt in all the majesty of state, Adorned with all the honours of the great, The king, resplendent on his regal car, Shines awful in the iron front of war: He stood, then stretched his sceptre; all around Hang in attention to the grateful sound. Down to the dust he bends his reverend head, And to the Almighty, supplicating, pray'd. O great unknown—O all-creating mind, In greatness lost, Almighty, unconfin'd To space or time, whose mighty hand informs The rattling tempests, and the sable storms, Absorb'd in light, O vast infinitude! Incomprehensible, supremely good, Attend, O heavenly! from thy glory hear, And to a dust-formed worm incline thine ear! String the firm arm, and teach the hand to fight; Confound the proud, that trust in mortal might. All own thy sway, and at thy great command Success attends the weak and feeble hand. Thus said, the devout monarch suppliant bowed, And muttering prayers ran along the crowd. In dazzling arms the chiefs terrific shine, Glide through the ranks, and form the lengthening line. While from the embattled foe a hero strode; A coat of mail hangs from his shoulders broad; On his high towering head terrific waved A crested helmet that the sabre braved. On his left hand he bears a spacious shield, Glittering with iron terrour o'er the field; And in his right he waves the shining blade. He greatly stood—and thus provoking said: Ye Scots, ye nation full of fraud and guile! Ye mean descendants of a barren soil! Let one advance (the bravest I demand), And fall a victim to my conquering hand; Forget your fears, your wonted fears controul, Let fate enlarge the ever little soul. He said; and rage, in tickling poison, ran Through every soul, and stung each generous man. The Hunter heard; rage sparkled from his eyes, And from his inmost soul the hero sighs; Then thus indignant spoke:—Ah! glory gone! Ah! ancient virtue now for ever flown! What blessed corner does the godhead rest? No more you swell the generous Scottish breast, When thus, O Scotland! Saxons dare deride Thy steel-clad warriors, ranged side by side— I can no more—my panting vitals swell; I'll give thee glory, or thy soul to hell! Then towards the foe the youth indignant moved: Fear trembles, en'mies praise, and envy loved. He strides along the men-environed ground; His rattling arms emit an iron sound: The Saxon saw, advanced, nor looked behind, Fate hurried on, and courage steel'd his mind. Bright in effulgent arms the youths appeared; Each o'er the plain a steely column reared: They rush together; clashing arms afar Reflect the horrours of the dismal war. Awful the blades wave gleaming in the sky, And from the crashing steel the sparkles fly. They fight, and, wearied, cease, and fight again; Their feet bake dust with blood upon the plain. Death undetermined points to each his stings, And conquest flutters round on dubious wings. The hill-born youth reminds, with anxious care, What vaunts the foul-mouth'd Saxon breath'd on air; His country's love the youthful hero warms, And vengeance strung his almost wearied arms. Upraised aloft, the light reflexive blade Sings through the air, and cleaves the Saxon's head. The broken skull, and shivered helmet, strew'd The sandy plain, that reeks with human blood. He gasping falls, and shakes the thundering ground, And, dying, toss'd his quivering limbs around. Thus falls an oak, that long majestic stood The tallest honours of the waving wood; Deep hack'd by the shipwright's unerring hand, Groans, slow inclines, and, falling, shakes the land. When on the field the Saxon lay supine, The English tremble through each sable line. Half-bending backward, much they wish to fly, And terror sparkles from each troubled eye. Confirmed with joy, the Scots advance the war; To save their country is their only care: Fair liberty each youthful bosom warms, And in the jaws of death they seek her arms. Now from the levelled tubes loud thunders roar, And lightning flashed along the awful shore. They fall, and pitchy smoke enwraps them round; The bubbling blood floats on the fatal ground. Shouts, dying groans, and noise of arms, invade The dreaming portals of the startled head. So, when contending blasts for empires strive, Through the Cerulean vault the clouds they drive, Till o'er some brow the gloomy shades engage, And low'ring heaven trembles at their rage; Red lightnings flash, and rough voiced thunders shake, Earth bends her mountains, and her vallies quake. Now raging 'midst the foe, terrific shines The hill-born youth, and breaks the hostile lines. Around him nought is heard but dying groans, The crashing steel, and noise of fractured bones. Where'er he towers, the foe betake to flight, Or death enwraps them in eternal night. Arms, half-lopt limbs, and gasping men up-piled, O'erspread confusion on the dismal field. Diminished now, the vanquished English fly, Force, valour, conduct, could no aid supply. Fierce on the rear the hill-born hero hangs, Lops the slow tail, and every hero bangs. Henry returns—Henry, whose haughty line Descends from Edward—Edward, half divine, Who knew stern Mars in all his frightful forms! Proud Gallia trembles as the hero storms: Great in his blood, great in his manly mind, The godlike Harry stately stood behind. To cope with Donald is his only care, And dam the deluge of the rushing war. The youthful hero stood in arms incased, And thoughtful argued in his manly breast. If carried on the headlong stream I fly, I'll fall inglorious, unrevenged die: Or, even if safety should reward my flight, How many souls will be enwrapt in night! The Scots would glory to see how Henry fled, The blood of Edward, and the Saxon head. The people perish when the chieftain flies— No; Henry conquers, or revenged dies! Thus rashly said, the hero, bold and young, Swells in his arms, and stately strides along; With easy steps, majestically slow, To brave the headlong fury of the foe. Thus of his youthful might the courser proud, Stems the rough current of the headlong flood; White his broad chest the bubbling liquid laves, Steadfast he moves amidst the raging waves. Towards youthful Henry Donald furious strode; He longs to revel in his English blood. They meet, they fight, and rage each youth possessed; Fierce vengeance fired, and anger gnawed each breast. Intent to conquer, both to fly forgot; Each for his life, and both for glory fought. Death, empty bugbear! could no longer fright, Or ought restrain the youthful hand from fight. Now Henry silver skin with wounds inlaced, And crimson flood-gates in his manly breast: Adown his limbs the purple torrent flows: By slow degrees his arm more feeble grows; He parries faintly, and he strives with pain; Then falls, o'erwhelmed, and shakes the dusty plain. Low-ebbing life faint on his eye-ball swims, And scarce he moves his death-suspended limbs. O! would to Heaven that thus each Saxon lay; Then late posterity would bless this day, The Hunter cries: Nor should it be forgot, That Steuart's sceptered, and that Donald fought. But ah! how fading is a mighty name, And but a moment sounds the trump of fame! Forgot the conqueror and the vanquished die; No little deeds claim immortality. The Hunter spoke: and Henry thus replies; (And scarcely lifts his death-congealed eyes) It ill becomes a man to gasp for fame; An empty phantom is a mighty name. Boast now the conquering Caledonians may, Since victory has crowned the toilsome day; But Donald most may his own valour raise, Since weeping matrons shall record his praise. But comes the day this shall be dearly paid (Prophetic Merlin thus in rapture said), Long Saxons shall for Scottish liberty, Enwrapt in death, far from your country lie. The hill-descended shall retain the prize, Until a race, deep-versed in policies, Shall sprout from Saxon trunk, and schemes unfold, To change their steely points to fusil gold; Then shackled on his heath, the hill-born swain Shall crawl along, and move his hard-bound limbs with pain. Fair Liberty to them shall lose her charms, And Scots shall tremble at the sight of arms. Exalted in his soul, the hero said, Then shut his lips, and slept among the dead. CANTO V. Deep musing in his inmost soul retired, Or damped with grief, or indignation fired, The hunter stood, and all himself forgot, Within the fancied field of solemn thought. Be shackled, tremble at the sight of arms, Shook all his youthful soul with dire alarms. His soul-tormenting thoughts no pleasure find; And all the hero trembled in his mind. Or stung by grief, or fired with patriot rage, O more than slaves—O sluggish poltroon age, The Hunter cries; O should my life restored Inform these limbs,—then should the avenging sword Lop off the mean debasers of our blood, And drive from earth the gold-deluded brood. In vain the valiant Caledonian dies, To conquer liberty, a noble prize For his degenerate race, if yet a toy, A glittering plaything, can your cares employ. Vile empty shew, and no substantial good, Not proof against the north, no fostering food. Ah! then shall Liberty for ever fly With downcast head, and tear-o'erflowing eye! Methinks I see the lovely form decay; While honour quenches each resplendent ray. The hero tortured thus his manly mind, While shouts triumphal swell upon the wind. For lifeless now the English press'd the plains, Or pined reluctant in coercive chains; Now sprightly Victory, on her golden car, Leads arms and trophies, and the spoils of war. Joy sparkles from her eye, and from her tongue A turbid stream of vaunting roars along; Shouts, rough bravadoes, a loquacious train! Her blustering handmaids, croud her noisy reign. The assembled chiefs around the Hunter stood, And withered elders to the hero bowed. Amazed each chieftain views the great unknown; Him dread of Saxons, and their bulwark own; His manly port, and round-form'd limbs admire; And whence the youth, inquisitive inquire. Thus they; the monarch, with majestic mien, Triumphant towers along the bloody plain. And where the youth to whom my crown I owe? The bold chastiser of the invading foe? The monarch cries—where is the youth unknown, The stedfast pillar of my regal throne? Methinks I see him 'midst the day's alarms, Hang on the foe, and raving in his arms; Towering along the field with panting breath, Hew down the man, and mark his steps with death. The task be mine his valour to condone, While grateful Scotia owns her warlike son. Swift at the word the obsequious herald flies, His message painted in his joyful eyes. Then thus: O! chief of men, your country's shield; O! valiant reaper in the iron field; Come, bold physician of your country's groans, Thou best and greatest of her warlike sons; Thee, thee, O chief, Fergusian Stewart calls To endless honour in his regal halls. There, there, in honour's arms resign thy breath, Till age shall snatch thee to the shades of death. Nor shall the shade involve thy splendid fame, But distant ages shall resound thy name. He ceased—Let him command, whose righteous sway These heroes own, 'tis Donald's to obey, The youth rejoins—too well my feats he pays; And greater merit would deserve thy praise. He said, then towards the king he greatly moved; Admired by heroes, and by heroes loved. While thus majestic strode the youth along, To either side incline the warrior throng. With polished horns, and curling front upreared, Thus moves the bull amidst the lowing herd; Awed by their chief, the lowing field divide, And form a sable wall on either side; While unconcerned he moves amidst the throng, And drags behind a length of tail along. Arrived—O thou whose all-defending sway, The hero cries, and godlike chiefs obey; Who deal'st thy blessings on our rocky shore, Thy enemies tremble when thy thunders roar. Let every rising day thy glories sing, And Caledonians bless their godlike king. Whene'er the foe assails my country's laws, My soul takes wing to side the generous cause: No hope of gain incites, no fears control; My love, my duty, hurry on my soul: Unpuffed by honour, by thy gold unstored, Thy foes shall gasp beneath this shining sword. That empty toy shall ne'er command my will; Let future ages God the shining ill. The king admires the man, his deeds, his mind Averse to ill, and placid, thus rejoined: O more than valiant, honest, steady, brave, Eternal honour shall the hero have, Who saves his country, nor is basely sold To sordid interest and the love of gold. He said, then to his manly bosom prest The hill-born youth, and grew upon his breast. Such condescension fired the hero's mind; The man removed, but left his soul behind. Love, loyalty, esteem, his mind imprest, Ran through his soul, and kindled in his breast. The ranks condensed, slow to the town incede, Foot rose with foot, and head advanced with head. The polished arms reflect the setting day, Wave o'er the men, and clank along the way. Round hoarse-voiced drums, and crooked trumpets sound; And echo trembles through the mountains round. Now with the pomp Edina's turrets rung; Soft maids, old matrons, from the windows hung. A general shout salutes them from their toils, And gloomy age is brightened into smiles. Amidst the crowd the fond maternal eye Seeks out her son, her young and only joy: Sometimes she hopes, and then she trembling fears, And down the furrowed cheeks descend the tears. The soft enamoured maid is racked with pain, She blushed to seek, and trembled for her swain. Along the ranks slow moves the silvered sage, A staff supports the senior's tottering age; And keen inquires, O does my Allan breathe? Or gasp'd my son beneath the arm of death? By slow degrees retired the fading day; Advanced from east the night in sober gray: Triumphal bonfires on the darkness gain, And light internal chequered through the pane. Rocks, sky, and houses rend with noisy joy: And sparkling fireworks blaze along the sky. Thus some hybernal nights, when darkness veils The weeping sky, the fiery meteor sails Oblique along the gloom—and silent night Yields to the glories of the thwarting light. Assembled now within the palace halls, While lights resplendent glitter on the walls, To crown the joyful day, majestic sat The dauntless pillars of the rocky state. Joy, liberty, and dangers past, combine To mingle gladness with the joys of wine. With temperate draughts they cheer the tossed soul; And Gallia's nectar sparkles in the bowl. Each chief the Hunter's valour blazes forth, And greatness stoops to honour real worth. Each valiant Caledonian's health goes round; With every hero's name the vaulted halls resound. Exalted with such breast-inflaming joys, Let fair Egidia come, the monarch cries; For her, her sovereign, her, her father calls, To please his heroes in his regal halls. She and her nymphs shall form a sprightly choir To move harmonious to the charming lyre. The blooming nymphs shall form the graceful round, And trip obedient to the various sound. Swift as the word the blooming maids obey, The king commands, though blushes tempt to stay. The blooming bevy come with modest grace, Love-darting eyes, and rose-suffused face. Attractive charms each lovely damsel wears, In youth's fair bloom, and pride of vernal years: Above the rest, with more majestic air Egidia towers, and more divinely fair Outshines the maids, as the bright queen of night, Amidst attendant stars, with silver-streaming light. Adown her neck the golden ringlets flow; Her lovely cheeks with roseate colours glow: In her mild face the modest graces rise, And beauty sparkles from her heavenly eyes. The lilies wander in her heaving breast; Her beauties self-admiring throngs confest. A robe around her fragrant body swims, But ill concealed her round-formed snowy limbs. The fair advanced, the astonished peers admire, And withered elders felt an inward fire. Abashed, immoveable, the Hunter stood, Unusual ardour bubbled through his blood; From head to foot the lovely maid surveys, And on her beauties feeds his longing eyes. From admiration love's unerring dart Inflamed his soul, and tickled through his heart. CANTO VI. The tuneful minstrel touch'd the sounding string, And at the sound the virgins form a ring; And to his voice he first prelusive played, When music's soul his moving hand obeyed, How Kenneth, furious for his father slain, Hews down the foe, and reaps the bloody plain, When hostile bodies, Scoon, thy fields bestrowed, And Tay empurpled ran with Pictish blood, The peers take fire with the war-moving sound, And vaulted halls rebellow the hoarse sound. The minstrel changes to a softer strain, The vows of virgins, and the lover's pain. How Wallace fired with fair Hersclea's charms, His country saved, then rushed into her arms: How first reluctant, then with love opprest, The fair one melts upon the lover's breast. Obedient to the sound, the maids advance, And form the mazes of the sprightly dance. First slow-majestic swim the harmonious round; Then soft-inclining catch the changing sound. Poise the small body, swing arms white and soft, And with alternate tripping shake the loft. In mournful melody now melts the strain; How the fair one, by cruel Heslrig slain, Transfixed with steel, resigned her balmy breath, And pallid, gasp'd in the iron jaws of death: How tossing her white limbs the charmer died, When blood flows round her in a crimson tide. The lovely choir restrain the swelling joy, And pearly drops hang in each tender eye. The harmonious gestures sorrowful represt, And sadness heaves the great o'erwhelmed breast. Then, then, he sung the hero's shameful end, Who thought no foe lurked in the insidious friend. What cries, O Scotland! filled thy studded plains! When thy great son thus struggled in thy chains. The hill-born youth, fired with the moving strain, All furious rose, concussed with generous pain. He half-unsheathed his sword, and even though dead, Wish'd in the traitor's head to sheath the blade. He greatly towers along, nor can assuage His manly fury, and his patriot rage. The fair admire his shape, his port, his size, The sprightly splendour of his manly eyes; The endearing features of his generous face; He stands majestic, and he walks with grace. Adown his neck a flowing tide unfurls Of golden hair, that waves in orient curls. His party-coloured leg is decked with snow; And all the graces in the hero glow. But more than all, his high-respected name, His well-got honours, and unspotted fame, Find easy access to a virgin's heart, And venom add to Cupid's killing dart. The fair Egidia views, and viewing loves; Through all the man her eye incessant roves. By slow degrees she felt the flame increase; Her soul denies it, but her eyes confess. High inbred thoughts oft turn the eye aside; But love steps in, and steals a look from pride. Long, long, against the rushing tide she strove; Then tumbled headlong down the stream of love. Thus watermen incessant ply the oar Up the rough stream, and round the billows roar: Then wearied throw the water vans aside, And unobserved descend along the tide. The pleasant tyrant all the fair oppressed, And lordly revelled in her snowy breast. Love heavy sits on every deep-fetched sigh, Love languid looks from either tender eye: Love, love expelled each passion of the soul; No room for these, for love possessed the whole. Despised the minstrel, and forgot the strain, Love only pleases; love alone shall pain: Disturbed the mien of unaffected ease, And all that native sweetness formed to please. The fair to all the pangs of love resigned; And hugged the tyrant in her labouring mind. What blest solace shall the racked maid require! In crowds and silence glows the inchanted fire: Some hope of ease in solitude to find, The fair removes, but left her soul behind. Night's silver shield possessed the southern way, And silent sheds on earth nocturnal day. Remove the peers—to drown in soft repose The care, the toils of day, and all its woes. In vain the hill-born courts, with bending eyes, The downy power, soft sleep far distant flies. To heart-corroding thoughts he gives his breast, And fair Egidia all his soul possessed. Still to his mind the fair ideas rise, Still blooming painted to his fancy's eyes. The blooming virgin swims th' harmonious round, Her eyes with every glance inflict a wound, Each little gesture, each attractive grace, Each smirking feature of her lovely face; Each harmless look, to innocence resigned, In fond procession pass before the mind. O blooming! lovely, more than mortal charms; But, ah! created for another's arms. O! heavenly nymph, adorned with every grace, Whom lavish nature has designed to please: Could aught like me, O maid! the Hunter cries, Draw but one look from these love-darting eyes! O could my longing hours, devoid of rest, Excite a sigh within that throbbing breast! But, ah! methinks I hear yon virgin say, Away, away, indecent clown, away: It ill befits these labour-hardened arms To clasp, enraptured, such a world of charms. How ill his figure, how uncouth he moves: Away, rough hind, unfit for courtly loves. Life I will sink the pangs of love beneath, Or shame shall throw me to the jaws of death. The Hunter said, and hugged his gloomy care, And pined beneath thy sable hand, Despair! These drooping thoughts employed the troubled head; He tumbles ceaseless on the downy bed: Till pitying sleep floats on his boiling breast, Stole on his eyes, and gave a troubled rest. Now mimic Fancy, fleeting fairy! reigns, And gentle trips through thought-created scenes. A thousand eye-balls in her forehead stare; A thousand wings around her beat the air. Far swifter than the cloud-compelling wind, The fleetest daughter of the spirit mind, Or skims the sea, or trips o'er desart land, And nature listens to her great command. Create, with equal ease, the goddess can An atom, world, an insect, or a man. By Fancy's hand, the sleeping hero led, Strayed in the windings of a verdant mead; Her own creation: rocks environed round, And leafy wood surround the happy ground. Down the black rocks, descend on every side The bubbling streams, and silent roll the tide Through the dyed vale; while breathing zephyrs pass Along the plain, and whistle through the grass. The fragrant flowers their dewy bells unfold, While southern Phœbus paints the buds with gold. There, half-inclining, blushed the crimson rose; The snowy lily all its beauty shews; In golden splendour there the crocus shines; Surcharged with dew the violet inclines: And more ten thousand ne'er acquired a name, Hanging, projected o'er the murmuring stream. From every bough the feathered warblers sing, And youthful laughs around the joyful spring. While thus the sleeping youth delighted roves Through fancied fields, and breeze-remurmuring groves, Upon a flowery bank Egidia lay, In beauty's bloom, and all serenely gay. The fair observed, and to the grove she flies, But gently courts him with returning eyes. The youth inflamed, O! stay, my darling, stay! No foe you fly, O stay, my love! I pray. No wood-born savage rudely seeks your arms; Stay, stay, O nymph! and let us view thy charms. I crave, I burn, I die of mad despair; Stay, lovely maid! and sooth my glowing care. The fair relents, and seems to yield her charms; The youth prepares to clasp her in his arms: While, fleet as thought, the blissful vision flies, And nought appears to his new-wakening eyes. The youth awakes, again awakes the flame; Dream on, fond soul, for ever dream the same, The hero cries; in vain he calls for rest, Soft sleep far flies from the revolving breast. CANTO VII. Monday, 29th November. These dates in the MS. are preserved, to mark the period when the poem was written. Aurora opes the portals of the dawn, And orient Phœbus chequered through the pane. Up springs the youth, the youth upsprings and sighs— Farewell, ye regal halls, farewell, he cries; Farewell, unhappy honours of the war: I grasp, I grasp, thy sable hand, Despair. Ye well-known mountains, and ye rural scenes, Ye rough-browed rocks, and heath-involved plains, Receive your traveller, nor receive him whole, The fair Egidia claims your ranger's soul: Once more I'll trace alone these arduous brows, And pitying Echo shall repeat my woes. Ye once-loved scenes, what pleasure can ye find? What blessed solace to sooth the Hunter's mind? None, none but thee, O soul-attractive fair! Can free my mind of heart-corroding care. Still to my mind thy form shall stand confessed, Till death shall snatch thee from my bleeding breast. November 30. But how remove and leave the maid behind, The pain, the comfort, of my love-sick mind? Farewell, O north! farewell, ye heathy plains, The maid detains me in coercive chains. But how be here, and view these heavenly charms Infolded willing in another's arms? Another revel on that snowy breast; Another in the fair Egidia blessed. I'll fly, I'll fly these soul-inflaming eyes, Roar seas betwixt us, and let mountains rise. Be silent fame, nor ever pain the ear, I wish to know, it thrills my soul with fear. Thus racked the hill-born youth his manly mind; Nor knew beneath thy hand Egidia pined, All-conquering love! Increased the golden day, And darts oblique on earth a sultry ray. The peers assembled in the audience hall, And, where the valiant youth? incessant call. With heavy steps the mountaineer descends; Each honoured hero to the warrior bends. The feast renewed—goes round the sparkling bowl, And temperate draughts revive the drooping soul. And deigns the stranger tell from whence he came, To reap this harvest of unequal fame, The monarch placid spoke—What happy sire To hear thy deeds shall feel a father's fire? What happy mother does the hero own, Who now sits tearful for her godlike son? What numerous tribe now miss your warrior-head, While in the youth the people's bulwark fled? Say, highly-honoured, say, your country's friend, Speak, valiant youth:—Ye noble peers attend. The monarch said, and with attentive mien Expects reply.—The Hunter, touched with pain, In mute suspense, and deep-revolving stands, Fain to evade—but 'tis the king commands. Then thus: Of me no joyful father hears, No matron's eye for me is drowned in tears; No numerous tribe sigh for their absent head; In me, in me no popular bulwark fled: Obscure, unhonoured, and the mate of swains; No noble blood encircles in these veins. 2d December, 1756. Ere reason shone upon my infant mind, If fame says true, too fickle fortune, kind, Smiled on the morn of life; her little care A nurse removes from all-destroying war. From house to house, from land to land, she flies, Infolding in her arms her little prize: My dear, my dear, oft, oft she weeping said, And me unto her heaving bosom laid; How fallen! how fallen is that house of state! Once blest recess of what is truly great. How wrapt in night is all that grandeur gone! And you, my darling, hopeless, left alone. Ah me! when pierced with steel thy father lay, And bloody streams flow round him every way, Thy mother came, she starts, she tears her hair, And with her shrieks she rends the midway air; What cruel hand, what bloody hand, she cries, Has done this deed? her words are lost in sighs. My life! my soul! what more have I beneath? She stopt—she staggered, and she swooned in death. What ruffian rage from every hall resounds; Groans press on groans, and wounds increase on wounds. Here, pierced with steel, a faithful servant lay; And windowed there the mangled maids decay. With thee, with thee, my life, I trembling fly, And tempt the horrors of the nightly sky; Through want and penury with thee I fare, Nor pay too dearly for protecting care. Thus oft she said, thus oft she wept and sighed, While I, in pity to her sorrow, cried. Now twice three summers scarce my limbs informed With hapless life, while yet more roughly stormed Thy blasts, Misfortune! fluctuating tide Of life, how changeful! my preserver died. Then sighing, tearing, friendless, sad, forlorn, Full on thy headlong stream, Misfortune! borne; With trembling steps, through unknown lands, I stray; Goodnature feeds, and fortune points the way. Unheedful, onward thus I mournful tread, Till Grampian rocks, projected o'er my head, Threat ruin o'er my head; bewildered there, With mournful cries, I rend the empty air. I sigh, I gasp, my hapless fate bemoan, And echoing rocks returning groan for groan. Woe's me, I soft repeat in broken sighs; Woe's me, false echo from the rocks replies. O come, O come, I then enraptured cry; O come, O come, the hollow rocks reply. The voice obeyed. I come, 'tis silence all; I cry, another rock repeats the call. From rock to rock, from hill to hill, I move, And long, Fatigue! against thy toils I strove: O'ercome with care, o'erwhelmed with endless toil, I spread my limbs along the heathy soil. The plaintive sound begins to faint in sighs; The sad response in just gradation dies. I now am dandled by the hand of fate, And death seems knocking at the trembling gate. Upon the cheek the roseate colour dies, And life swims faintly on my closing eyes. While 'twixt two rocks the setting sun displays A golden splendour and a stream of rays, Advanced a shade; I, starting, hope to fly, The weakened limbs my vain efforts defy. At first I saw a frizled snow of hair, Lost in the gleam, or glistering wave in air: A nearer view disclosed a withered man, Deep-dinted wrinkles both his cheeks o'er-ran; Sunk are his bloodshot eyes, each blooming grace Congealed, and age sat wintered on his face. Inwrapt in party-coloured plaid he stands; A batton trembled in his aged hands: He views, he feels the hapless foundling's woes, And pity brightens on his aged brows: A generous sympathy his bosom warms; He hugs me, trembling, in his folding arms. Cease, cease to cry, my dear, he soothing said, Cease, cease to cry, then wrapt me in his plaid. Whence came the babe? whence came my child? he cries; I answered not, congealed in dumb surprise. What cursed design, what cruel heart could part Such blooming beauty from a brazen heart? What heavenly features, what attractive grace, What beauty wanders in his blooming face! How sweetly pleasant through that vail of woes, Thus in a shower is seen the blushing rose: O cease, my son, and dry these briny tears, You'll find a father in my tottering years. He ceased, and me unto his bosom pressed, Yet unconfirmed, I trembled on his breast; As one who, hopeless, carried on the tide, By unexpected fortune gains the side, Suspended on a twig, in deep surprise, Quakes on the plain, and scarce believes his eyes. I trembled thus; he shakes the heathy plains With tottering feet; his steps a staff sustains. At length from his low roof black columns rise Of pitchy smoke, and gain on evening skies. The turfy hut, with virid moss o'ergrown, Long rows support of uncemented stone. Round, sheep, rough goats, and lowing herds appear, And sounds commixed invade at once the ear. Rocks intersperse the variegated space; Here stony columns rise, there smiles the virid grass: While through the shaded green, rough murmuring, glides A brook crystalline, with meand'ring tides. CANTO VIII. Now past a child, yet an imperfect man, With youthful limbs through mossy heaths I ran; Exulting in the vernal pride of years, Forgot misfortune and my childish tears; From twanging strings began let fly the dart, Or with the winged ball arrest the hart; The flying chace with supple joints pursue, Or gird the forest with the hunter's crew; To wholesome sports gave all my youthful mind, Gain on the youths, and leave the youths behind. The senior saw his son outstrip the whole, And gladness brightens the time-laden soul. Thus when some country sees her son afar Extend her arms, and urge the prosperous war, Exulting thoughts each generous soul elate, And gladness looks around with joy complete. Soon as Aurora faintly promised day, And mountains hood their tops in dusky gray, The narrow vales and steepy rocks resound With shouts inciting on the faithful hound. The fleeting tribe devour the heathy way, Vanish along, and rouse the lurking prey. The timid prey to every quarter fly, Skim o'er the heath, and leave the aching eye. The branching stag, and lightly-bounding roe, Stretch o'er the field, and pant before the foe: The gasping hind the cooling flood relieves, One death she flies, another death receives; In vain attempts to leave the liquid tide, The nimble foe awaits on every side: Long floating, wearied, sinks in watery death, And spirts the foam with her departing breath. Increased the day, the branchy nation fall, Or torn by dogs, or winged by the ball. Stag falls on stag, hound lacerates with hound, And bloody torrents smoke along the ground. The radiant lord of day his glory shrouds, And hides his beamy head in sable clouds; Rough-murmuring blasts along the mountains howl, And sable darkness quenched the glowing pole: Thick-gathered mists enwrap the mountains o'er, And hoarse-voiced thunders roughly rumbling roar. Red lightnings dart in awful streams of light, Flash through the gloom, and vanish from the sight. Engaged the warring elements resound, Rain batters earth, and smokes along the ground. Down the steep hill the headlong torrent groans, Drives trees uprooted, rocks and rattling stones. Nought can resist: earth from her caverns rung; The flood spreads on the vale, and turbid rolls along. Bewildered in the dark diurnal night, Hood-winked with clouds, and with uncertain light, I ply the moist uncomfortable way, And errant, through the shaggy mountains stray. My friends, my fellows, I incessant cry; In the rough blast my words half-uttered die. My friends I call, my words in wind are lost; And nought is heard but the shrill-whistling blast. From heath to heath, from hill to hill, I roam In vain, researching for my humble home. When on the howling wild, black rained the night, And from my eyes erased the glimmering light. Athwart the gloom the sparkling meteor sails With livid glories and volcanian trails. The dire portents my youthful soul affright, And kindle horrors in the womb of night. Aghast, immoveable, I shivering stood, Cold horror trembled through my freezing blood. While a soft voice invades my trembling ear, My soul is charmed, and listened in my fear. 'Twixt every blast is heard the pleasing sound, Then in the howling hurricane is drowned. Led by the voice, I cheerful mete the way; Swells on the ear the soft-approaching lay. Charmed, I advanced, astonished I survey Dart through a rocky chink a livid ray. Inward I peeped, a lovely maid is seen, Trip through the cave in robes of sprightly green: White is her skin, her cheeks are rosy red; Soft wave behind the honours of her head. Ennobled features due respect command, And blazed a taper in her snowy hand: Swifter than wind the fleeting vision glides Athwart the cave, and swims on airy tides. The sport of every blast the vision reels, Nor touched the earth with lightly-bounding heels. Thus, in a splendid day, or lunar night, Assembled boys let fly the towering kite; The beardless youths extatic leap with joy, While it ascends and flutters in the sky. With sprightly air the phantom beauty sings Exploits of fairies and of phantom kings; The vows of youths, the enamoured virgin's care, And all the soft deceits of shifting fear. Charmed with the lay, yet freezed with dumb surprise, I staring stood, and scarce believed my eyes. Doubtful advancing to enjoy the light, Or glide, retreating, to the womb of night, I reasoned long in my revolving breast, At length my soul, half muttering, thus expressed: Behind, rough rushes night with thundering storms, And awful light the gloomy sky deforms; Before, a calm recess attracts the view, Where fainting nature may her strength renew. What though there glides within a feeble mind, An empty phantom, or a puff of wind? By fancy formed; to life restrain your flight, Nor fly a shade and perish in the night. Confirmed, advancing, O! whose noble birth Descends from more than men the worms of earth; O be propitious, nymph! I suppliant said, And to the wanderer lend thy timely aid; Rest here my limbs until returning day Instruct the path, and point the ranger's way. I suppliant said—the vision thus replies, And bends aside her beauty-sparkling eyes. A youth, descended from the blood of great, Lost to himself, to honour, and to state, Long Grampus shall ascend your arduous brows, And with the winged death arrest the roes; At length, bewildered in the sable night, Led by a voice and feeble ray of light, Shall, undesigning, learn approaching fate, And mount from knowledge to the arms of state. Hard is the ascent, but, oh! how seeming light, When honour tempts thee to the world polite! The phantom said, while to my wondering eyes Green prospects spread, and varied scenes arise. A spacious field, to limits unconfined, Spreads every way, and leaves the eye behind. Ten thousand through its spacious windings stray; Ten thousand walk, and each a different way: They ceaseless ply their errors, void of rest; Each cursed his way, but calls his way the best. Scoffs, murmurs, accusations, causeless fear, And desperate voices thunder on the ear. Full in the centre of the spreading ground, With sloping sides, arose a virid mound: Easy the ascents at distance seem to rise; A nearer view disclosed the slippery ice. Glad on the top a maid of winning charms, Courts from below with snowy-spreading arms; Her rosy cheeks are dimpled o'er with smiles, And with one wink the hapless she beguiles. Up the steep hill ten thousand lovers crawl, And on the point of bless they headlong fall. Again, again the glittering steep they ply; Again they fall, again they quivering lie. But some more happy gain the arduous brow, And giggle scoffs upon their mates below. By the gay maid in splendid garments clad, And laurels planted on the towering head: Thus for a moment they majestic reign, The envy of their rivals on the plain. With swelling cheeks, and vengeance-flaming eyes, I saw a ghastly form terrific rise: Thy offspring, hell! her ever-moving tongue Rolls infamy, thy sluggish stream, along; Pregnant with ill, she heaves her rolling breast; For ever stare her eyes devoid of rest: Her poison-churning jaws divide with rage, She puffs and hurls them trembling off the stage. The raging fury bangs the flying throng, Roars on the rear, and sweeps the wretch'd along. Nor ceased the pest, till in the flood beneath, Deep, silent, sable stream, they sunk in death. The foul-voiced noise begins to melt away, The ghastly fury feels a swift decay, And vanish; lo! a new succession rose; It falls, another on its ruins grows. Thus in the circle of the rolling year, Fierce winter blasts, and vernal showers uprear The flowery field; here drops the blushing rose, There from the withered stem another grows: Flower grows on flower, and stem succeeds on stem, For ever different, but appear the same. CANTO IX. O, more than mortal! then I raptured cry, Explain these wonders that attract the eye! Youth, feeble youth, with ignorance combined, Weaken the soul, and vail the wondering mind: I said,—the blooming vision quick replies, This field's the world, there honour's columns rise; There stray, inconstant, all thy feeble kind; Their roads as various as the shifting wind. Towards that blooming form they turn their eyes, And honour, honour, is the good they prize. They rave, they burn, they died for honour's charms! Through toil, through death, they seek her lovely arms: But scarce their ardent thirst they can assuage, Till slander hiss them off the envied stage; Till infamy shall blast the ill got fame, And dark oblivion tumble round their name. The phantom spoke, the wonderous scene decayed: A new creation graced the forming maid; A rural scene! there heavy ears inclined, Shine o'er the field, and vibrate in the wind. The loaden tree with ripened fruitage glows; And through the grove the balmy zephyr blows. With gathered squadrons, cays, a sable train, Swim in the sky, or cheque the yellow plain. To different toils apply the rustic throng; Here lazy oxen drag the plough along: The lusty sheaves the binding reapers swell, And the slow carman hurls the screaming wheel. Now, ripe for birth, the full grown autumn smiled, And more than nature laughs along the field. Sated with joys complete, I turn the eye To shaggy mountains, and inclement sky; My fellows of the chace, I trembling view, In quest of me, a lamentable crew: The sable rocks they ceaseless rend with cries, And sorrow trickled from their longing eyes. Here, here I am, I often, often cried; The heedless crew passed on, nor aught replied. While on the plain I view my parent—sage, Tottering beneath a load of grief and age; With drooping head, which years had cap'd with snow, Laid on a staff, and move unwilling slow, The senior quaked on age-suspended limbs, And sad around, his fading eye-ball swims:— My son, my son! O, darling of my age! What headlong torrent, with impetuous rage, Roars round thy lifeless limbs; and, drowned, bears The light, the comfort of my aged years. O life fallacious! how thy hopes decay, You grant a bliss, then snatch the prize away! Ah me! for this did I my age employ, For death untimely save the rising boy! What ardent joys did then my soul confess, While Donald vanquished in the rapid race; What ardent joys dilate my ardent mind, While you transfixed the hart, or bounding hind; Oft have I seen, but ah! shall see no more, Here, here, where hapless I your loss deplore, Unerring wing the feathered arrow's flight, Or wield the gauntlet, or discharge the quoit. Come, Death, inwrap me, sable, silent shade; And, mourning grave! receive this hoary head. He stopt, he sighed, and tore the silver hair, And gnashed beneath thy grievous weight, Despair! I feel his grief, the tears begin to flow, And all my soul is touched with mighty woe. I start, I stretch my limbs, his soul to ease, While on the eye the transient scene decays: Faded the view, extinct diurnal light, And howled without the cloud-enveloped night. Thus in the horizon of the silent night, The setting moon darts parallel its light, Silvers the flood, and paints the landscape gay, And deals around the bright nocturnal day: But, sunk beneath, the pleasing prospects fail, And every object wears a melancholy veil. Sunk in a flood of heart-corroding woes, O'erwhelmed I stood; another scene arose:— Mingled with heroes in the iron field, A second self, astonished, I beheld; My shape, my size, my features, all the same, As oft looked trembling from undimpled stream; Athwart the side the well-known scabbard flies, The well-known plaid hangs plaited down the thighs; O'er half my leg the spangled buskin glows, And orient hair from th' azure bonnet flows: Upon this breast the plaid half hid beneath, The polished pistol, minister of death! Beneath my lifted arm the enemies groan, And I exult in bravery not my own; And victory, terrific, in her car, Hurls on the deluge of the noisy war; Graspt honour in thy arms, and high renowned My godlike heroes their preserver owned. Shouts, acclamations, rend the fluid air, While slow approached a soft majestic fair; Her blooming charms my reeling soul surprize, I senseless stood, and fixed on her my eyes: My soul is melted with the soft desire, The virgin smiled, and seemed to feel my fire. At once concedes her more than mortal charms, I spread my hands to clasp her in my arms; When all at once the blooming scene disjoin'd, And Donald hugged a blast of empty wind. Oh! cruel, cruel! I desponding said, While sunk the taper and the phantom maid; Rough-rumbling thunders through the sable groan, And blustering winds proclaim the vision gone. I start, unsheathed my sword, uprightly stood My hair, surprise ran shivering through my blood. A sprite in every fiery meteor past, A sprite seemed howling in each whistling blast; Until my soul, by resolution swayed, Despised each fear, and thought upon the maid. The maid, the maid, all, all my soul possessed, The maid sat empress in my rolling breast. Then, then her phantom all my bosom warms, What must I feel who saw her real charms; Her thought-created graces I admire, My reason slept, and fancy fed the fire. The wished for morn its early blushes spread, Reared o'er the eastern hill her rosy head; Sunk are the winds, the clouds together fly, And glows serene the azure-arched sky. Cheered with the blest return of sacred light, Eased of the gloomy terrors of the night, I glad ascend, and homeward bend my way; The hut appears with the meridian day. What scene appears of heart-corroding woe, The melancholy crowd, solemnly slow, Support my dead preserver to the grave; Death sped the blow, which aged sorrow gave. For me, for me, the senior drew his breath! For me, for me, the aged sunk in death! To find me in the grave; I sobbing paid My tearful tribute to the reverend shade: At once, love, gratitude, and duty mourn, My sire, my counsel, in the silent urn. Now on the eye decay the blissful scenes, The rough-browed rocks, and all the sloping plains Delight no more; no chace, no winged fowl, No goat, no cattle, cheer the mournful soul. The senior gone, the rural sports decayed, And love attracts the traveller to the maid. As when the playful youth delighted views A thousand flowers, of thousand various hues, Glow on the murmuring rivulet's farther side; He dips his foot, and, trembling, backward flies, Returns again, and lops the blooming toys: Thus undetermined long I dubious stood, Then headlong plunged in fortune's sable flood; Swift bounding forward, I devour the way, The oaten field and low-roofed hut decay; The hills step backward, as I onward stride Along the sharp-spiked rocks and mountains side. Tay, on thy banks, a courteous host! received, And balmy rest the nerve of toil relieved. Soon as the sky with, Sol! thy chariot glows, Made strong for toil, the wandering traveller goes; Ceaseless I mete the road, till setting day Darts parallel to earth a golden ray. A place there is, where the cerulean main Glides up 'twixt rocks, and forms an azure plain; There, there I stood, astonished to survey The roaring billows on the watery way; How liquid mountains dash against the shore, The rough rocks rumble, hoarse the billows roar: I stretch'd my limbs along the murmuring deep, And the hoarse billows lull my soul asleep. CANTO X. His toils, his woes, the hill-born hero sung, While from their seats the attentive audience hung. His woes, his toils, as yet they seem to hear; As yet his accents hang upon the ear, Though ceased. Swift from his seat Alcanor rose, Down to his heel the sable mantle flows; His aged limbs shook with the weight of years, His fading eyes distil the briny tears: O valiant youth! your face, the age rejoined, Recalls my hopeless son unto my mind; The same his features, and his shape the same, Thus death untimely wrapt the youthful frame. Ah me! my son, you treason's victim lay, While at your side thy consort's charms decay; While with thy child a matron servant fled; And friends enquiring thought your memory dead. But thou, dear object of my aged care, Whom Heaven designed the sad Alcanor's heir, By more than mortal led—thee, thee I own, My joy, my hope, my reviviscent son! Be still, fond heart! no more Alcanor grieves, Since in my godlike youth my Allan lives. The Senior said; and clasped the hero round: His reverend sire the valiant grandson owned. Tears flow on tears, and sigh succeeds on sigh, And either soul melts with the sudden joy; Swell on the air congratulations round, And mighty titles round the Hunter sound. Now, envy fled, the ancient peerage own, And greatness flashes from the mean unknown. Thus in the quarry, rough in every part, The moss-grown marble, till reformed by art, Unvalued lies, till forming hammers groan, The halls of greatness shine with Parian stone. Thus shone the chief amidst the bevied great, Brighter his fame shone on the arms of state; With joyful shouts the palace thundered round, And repercussive walls repel the sound. Thus lost in distance empty thunders roar, Or foaming billows lash the sounding shore; Heard by the midnight travellers as they roam, And swells the murmur on the silent gloom. The fair Egidia, as she sat alone, And silent breathed her sighs in plaintive moan, Felt noisy shouts invade the trembling ear, Starts from the dream of thought, and looks with fear. Surprise is painted in her blooming mien, And care succeeds the soft enamoured pain: Ah! hapless me! the trembling virgin cries, The tear half dropping from her azure eyes, The warrior youth, all by the great envied, Falls now perhaps a victim to their pride; O'erpowered, for such of late assailed the ear, From fields of death, and iron noise of war. Ophelia there? Come, maid! What means that noise? The hill-born youth departs, the peers rejoice: My queen! the maid replies; the bowl is crowned, And with the hero's health the vaulted halls resound. A sudden stupor every sense pervades, Upon her cheek the roseate tincture fades; In dumb surprise her soul astonished swims; The downy bed supports her falling limbs: A sudden qualm of sorrow and surprise Bound up the tongue, and blocked the gates of voice: The wakening soul resumes the seat again, She ceaseless rolls in agonizing pain; Tossed round her limbs, and furious with despair, She beat her breast, and tore her golden hair. Surprise is o'er; the tears begin to flow; And words expressive of the mighty woe: Egidia lives! and what she prized is fled! Come, death! and waft the hapless to the dead. Come lop this virgin flower, my sable spouse, And quench the flood-gates of these rushing woes. Sooth, sooth, O gentle! all my troubled breast; Within thy arms at last my soul shall rest! Birth, grandeur, state, farewell, ye empty toys, Ye curse of life, obstructions of my joys! O should a shepherdess upon the plain Bear me, a daughter, to some humble swain; Not nursed to grandeur, unconfined to state, The stately youth might love his rural mate! Clasped in Love's arms, in some low hut reclined, I'd pour upon his breast my love-sick mind; With thee, my swain, would bear the wintry cold, With thee would guard the cattle to the fold; Through Poverty's cold stream-with thee would gain, And lean-cheek'd Want might puff his blast in vain; With thee, with thee would tempt the rugged heath; With thee would live, with thee would sink in death. O bear me, bear me, Fortune, to some grove, Where your transfixer, harts! and mine may rove. Touched with my care, my tyrant may prove kind, Nor let that form conceal an iron mind. I seem, I seem through lonely fields to stray, Love wings my feet, and Love directs the way; I see, I see my lovely Hunter come, In pride of years, and beauty's fairest bloom. See, see, the suppliant seems to own my charms! I rush, I rush into his manly arms. But why, enthusiast! does thy fancy stray? Grandeur forbids, and birth besets the way. See! Greatness chides me with a frowning face; For shame, for shame, desire a clown's embrace! Let opening earth the blushing maid receive, Avail from Calumny the spotless grave. But, Calumny, can you my case remove? Too weak a combatant for mighty Love— Love, mighty Love, I am thy victim whole! Love holds the reins, and actuates my soul. But ah! perhaps a maid of happier charms Attracts the traveller to her lovely arms. In vain, Egidia, melts thy tearful eyes, Thy rival shall enfold thy envied prize. Blow, Boreas, blow the rough cerulean main, And from her arms the lovely youth detain. Time, time may wear her image from his mind, And chance may make the hill-born hero kind. In vain, in vain I sooth my glowing care, In vain elude thy venomed pangs, Despair! Even now, perhaps, the seamen ply the oar, And waft my soul into the farther shore. The lovely maid upon the bed reclined, Thus mournful tortured all her virgin mind. Obsequious maids, around the love-sick fair, Fetch sigh for sigh, and tear distil with tear. Some silent stand, and some attempt relief By balmy words, and sooth the virgin's grief; But still her snowy throbbing bosom sighs, And tears descend from her love-darting eyes. Her snowy neck disordered hair o'erspread, Her tear-washed cheeks diffuse a rosy red, Her swelling arms are decored with snow, And all the graces in the virgin glow. Thus, spreading her white limbs along the plains, The blooming Venus mourned Adonis slain: Adown her rosy neck the tresses flow, Her eyes look languid through the veil of woe; 'Twixt her loose robe her heaving breast is seen, And all the graces mourn around their queen. Thus on the downy bed the virgin burns, And round the fair the blooming bevy mourns. The monarch hears his love-sick daughter's pain: Why weeps my daughter, why, my joy, complain? The youth remains, nor is the noble fled, Nor shall his noble blood disgrace the marriage-bed. No horrid herdsman, no indecent hind, Of clownish manners, or rapacious mind, First, Cupid, aimed thy soft enamouring dart, And vanquished all my young Egidia's heart. Obscure, unhonoured, heedless, all alone, Lost to himself, and to the world unknown, The youth, long, Grampus! climbed thy brows, till fate Instructs the mind, and spread the arms of state. Good is thy choice, and what thy sire designed; Dry, dry these cheeks, and sooth thy troubled mind. The monarch placid spoke: The maid arose, Her raptured soul with joys extatic glows. The veil of woe removed, she brightly shone; As beamy Phœbus, or the silver moon Emerging from a cloud, she graceful moves, And gently trip around the little loves. Before the priest the blooming couple stand; Much she desired, but blushed to join the hand. 'Tis done; the youthful hero spreads his arms, And clasps, enraptured, more than phantomed charms. THE HIGHLANDER: A POEM. IN SIX CANTOS. CANTO I. The youth I sing, who, to himself unknown, Lost to the world and Caledonia's throne, Sprung o'er his mountains to the arms of Fame, And, winged by Fate, his sire's avenger, came; That knowledge learn'd so long deny'd by Fate, And found that blood, as merit, made him great. The aged chieftain on the bier is laid, And grac'd with all the honours of the dead: The youthful warriors, as the corpse they bear, Droop the sad head, and shed the gen'rous tear. For Abria's shore Tay's winding banks they leave, And bring the hero to his father's grave. His filial tears the godlike Alpin sheds, And towards the foe his gallant warriors leads. The chief along his silent journey wound, And fixed his rainy eyes upon the ground; Behind advanced his followers sad and slow, In all the dark solemnity of woe. Meantime fierce Scandinavia's hostile pow'r Its squadrons spread along the murmuring shore; Prepar'd, at once, the city to invade, And conquer Caledonia in her head. His camp, for night, the royal Sweno forms, Resolv'd with morn to use his Danish arms. Now in the ocean sunk the flaming day, And streaked the ruddy west with setting ray; Around great Indulph, in the senate, sat The noble chiefs of Caledonia's state. In mental scales they either forces weigh, And act, before, the labours of the day; Arrange in thought their Caledonia's might, And bend their little army to the fight. Thus they consult. Brave Alpin's martial gait Approach'd the portals of the dome of state, Resolv'd to offer to his king and lord, The gen'rous service of his trusty sword. Th' unusual sight the gallant chief admires, The bending arches and the lofty spires. On either side the gate, in order stand The ancient kings of Caledonia's land. The marble lives; they breathe within the stone, And still, as once, the royal warriors frown. The Fergusses are seen above the gate; This first created, that restor'd, the state. In warlike pomp the awful forms appear, And, bending, threaten from the stone the spear; While to their side young Albion seems to rise, And on her fathers turns her smiling eyes. And next appears Gregorius' awful name, Hibernia's conqu'ror for a gen'rous fame. Incased in arms, the royal hero stands, And gives his captive all his conquered lands. The filial heart of hapless Alpin's son In marble melts, and beats within the stone. Revenge still sparkles in the hero's eye: Around the Picts a nameless slaughter lye. The youthful warrior thus reviews, with joy, The godlike series of his ancestry. The godlike forms the drooping hero cheer, And keen ambition half believes the seer: Eager he shoots into the spacious gate; His eye commands;—without his followers wait. No frowning spearman guards the awful door; No borrowed terror arms the hand of power; No cringing bands of sycophants appear, To send false echoes to the monarch's ear; Merit's soft voice, oppression's mournful groan, Advanced, unstifled, to th' attentive throne. The hero, ent'ring, took his solemn stand Among the gallant warriors of the land. His manly port the staring chiefs admire, And half-heard whispers blow the soldier's fire. A while his form engaged the monarch's eyes; At length he raised the music of his voice: “Whence is the youth? I see fierce Denmark warms Each generous breast, and fires 'em into arms. A face once known is in that youth exprest, And mends a dying image in my breast.” He said:—and thus the youth: “'Midst rocks afar, I heard of Denmark, and of Sueno's war. My country's safety in my bosom rose: For Caledonia's sons should meet her foes. We ought not meanly wait the storm at home, But rush afar, and break it ere it come. Few are my followers, but these few are true; We come to serve our country, fame, and you!” He said:—the king retorts: “Thy form, thy mind, Declare the scion of a generous kind. With Scotia's foes maintain the stern debate, And spring from valour to the arms of state. Whoe'er would raise his house in Albion, should Lay the foundation in her en'mies' blood.” Then to the chiefs: “Supporters of my throne, Your sires brought oft the Roman Eagles down. Yourselves, my lords, have caused the haughty Dane To curse the land he tried so oft in vain. Norvegian firs oft brought them o'er the waves, For Albion's crown; but Albion gave 'em graves. Be still the same; exert yourselves like men, And of th' invaders wash our rocks again. Though few our numbers, these, in arms grown old, In Albion's and in Indulph's cause are bold. The brave man looks not, when the clarion sounds, To hostile numbers, but his country's wounds; Bold to the last, and dauntless he'll go on, At once his country's soldier, and her son.” The monarch thus his royal mind exprest, The patriot kindling in each generous breast. Each chieftain's mind with pleasure goes before, Already mingling with the battle's roar. In thought each hero sweeps the bloody plain, And deals, in fancy, death upon the Dane. Dunbar arose, the brave remains of wars, Silver'd with years, o'er-run with honest scars; Great in the senate, in the field renown'd: The senior stood; attention hung around. He thus: “Fierce Denmark all the north commands, And belches numbers on our neighb'ring lands; England's subdued, the Saxons are o'ercome, And meanly own a Danish lord at home. Scarce now a blast from Scandinavia roars, But wafts a hostile squadron to our shores. One fleet destroy'd, another crowns the waves: The sons seem anxious for their fathers' graves: Thus war returns in an eternal round; Battles on battles press; and wound on wound. Our numbers thinned, our godlike warriors dead, Pale Caledonia hangs her sickly head. We must be wise, be frugal of our store, Add art to arms, and caution to our pow'r. Beneath the sable mantle of the night, Rush on the foe, and, latent, urge the fight. Conduct, with few, may foil this mighty power, And Denmark shun th' inhospitable shore.” The senior spoke: a general voice approves; To arm his kindred-bands each chief removes. Night from the east the drowsy world invades, And clothes the warriors in her dusky shades. The vassal-throng advance, a manly cloud, And with their sable ranks the chieftains shroud. Each chief, now here, now there, in armour shines, Waves through the ranks, and draws the lengthened lines. Thus, on a night when rattling tempests war, Through broken clouds appears a blazing star; Now veils its head, now rushes on the sight, And shoots a livid horror through the night. The full-form'd columns, in the midnight-hour, Begin their silent journey tow'rds the shore: Through every rank the chiefs inciting roam, And rouzing whispers hiss along the gloom. A rising hill, whose night-invelop'd brow Hung o'er th' encamped squadrons of the foe, Shoots to the deep its ooze-immantled arm, And stedfast struggles with the raging storm. Here ends the moving host its winding road, And here condenses, like a sable cloud, Which long was gathering on the mountain's brow, Then broke in thunder on the vales below. Again the chiefs, in midnight-council met, Before the king maintain the calm debate: This waits the equal contest of the day, That rushes headlong to the nightly fray. At length young Alpin stood, and thus begun: “Great king! supporter of our ancient throne! Brought up in mountains, and from councils far, I am a novice in the art of war; Yet hear this thought.—Within the womb of night, Confirm the troops, and arm the youth for fight, While, softly treading, to yon camp I go, And mark the disposition of the foe; Or wakeful arm they for the dismal fight, Or, wrapt within the lethargy of night, Are left abandon'd to our Scottish sword; By sleep's soft hand in fatal chains secur'd. If Denmark sleeps in night's infolding arms, Expect your spy to point out latent storms; But, they in arms, too long delay'd my speed, Then place the faithful scout among the dead.” A general voice th' exploring thought approves, And every wish with youthful Alpin moves. The hero slides along the gloom of night: The camp-fires send afar their gleaming light. Athwart his side the trusty sabre flies; The various plaid hangs plaited down his thighs; The crested helm waves awful on his head; His manly trunk the mail and corslet shade; The pond'rous spear supports his dusky way; The waving steel reflects the stellar ray. Arrived, the dauntless youth, solemnly slow, Observant moved along the silent foe. Some 'braced in arms the midnight vigil keep; Some o'er the livid camp-fires nod to sleep; The feeding courser to the stake is bound; The prostrate horseman stretched along the ground; Extended here the brawny footman lay, And, dozing, wore the lazy night away; The watchman there, by sleep's soft hand o'erpowered, Starts at the blast, and half unsheaths his sword. Th' exploring youth, through night's involving cloud, Circling the foe, their disposition viewed. At length the hero's dusky journey ends, Where Haco feasted with his Danish friends. Haco by more than Sueno's blood was great, The promis'd monarch of the triple state. The Scandinavian camp the youth secured With watchful troops, and not unfaithful sword. Two oaks, from earth by headlong tempests torn, Supply the fire, and in the circle burn; Around, with social talk, the feast they share, And drown in bowls the Caledonian war. O'erpowered at length by slumber's silken hand, They press the beach, and cower upon the strand. A gallant deed the mountain-youth design'd; And nursed a growing action in his mind. Awful the chief advanced; his armour bright Reflects the fire, and shines along the night. Hovering he stood above the sleeping band, And shone, an awful column, o'er the strand. Thus, often to the midnight traveller, The stalking figures of the dead appear: Silent the spectre towers before the sight, And shines, an awful image, through the night. At length the giant phantom hovers o'er Some grave unhallowed, stained with murdered gore.— Thus Alpin stood. He exiles to the dead Six warrior youths; the trembling remnant fled: Young Haco starts, unsheaths his shining sword, And views his friends in iron chains secured. He rushes headlong on the daring foe; The godlike Alpin renders blow for blow. Their clattering swords on either armour fell; Fire flashes round, as steel contends with steel. Young Alpin's sword on Haco's helmet broke, And to the ground the staggering warrior took. Leaning on his broad shield the hero bends; Alpin aloft in air his sword suspends: His arm up-raised, he downward bends his brow, But scorned to take advantage of the foe. Young Haco from his hand the weapon threw, And from his flaming breast these accents drew: “Bravest of men! who could through night come on; Who durst attack, and foil an host alone! I see the man high on the warrior placed, Both mend each other in your noble breast. Accept, brave man, the friendship of a Dane, Who hates the Scot, but yet can love the man.” He said; while thus the Scot: “With joy I find The man so powerful in an en'my's mind; Your forces fled, amidst night's dark alarms, You both could stand, and use your gallant arms: Such valiant deeds thy dauntless soul confess, That I the warrior, though the Dane, embrace.” His brawny arms he round the hero flung; As they embrace the clashing corslets rung. The Dane resumes: “With the sun's rising beam, We may, in fields of death, contend for fame; Receive this shield, that, midst to-morrow's storms, Haco may grateful shun his well-known arms.” He said; and gave the gold-enamelled round; While, as he reached, the studded thongs resound. The amicable colloquy they end; And each, a foe, clasped in his arms a friend. This to the camp his dusky journey bends; While that to Albion's chiefs the hill ascends. Th' exploring journey all with pleasure hear, And own the valiant scout their noble care. Dissolved the council; the attack declined; Each with the gift of sleep indulged his mind: And, 'midst his kindred-bands supinely laid, Each softly slumbered on a mossy bed. His mind to soft repose young Alpin bends, And seeks the humble circle of his friends: Reclining on a rock the hero lies, And gradual slumbers steal upon his eyes. Still to his mind the Danish camp arose, Hung on his dreams, and hagg'd his calm repose: Once more he mixed with Haco in the fight, And urged, impending, on the Danish flight. CANTO II. Heaven's opening portals shot the beam of day; Earth changed her sable robe to sprightly grey; To west's dark goal the humid night is fled; The sun o'er ocean rears his beamy head; The splendid gleam from Scottish steel returns, And all the light reflexive mountains burns. Deep-sounding bag-pipes, gaining on the air, With lofty voice awake the Scottish war. The gallant chiefs, along the mountain's brow, Stand 'cased in arms, and lower upon the foe; Or awful through the forming squadrons shine, Build up the ranks, and stretch the lengthened line. Each clan their standards from the beam unbind; They float along, and clap upon the wind: The hieroglyphic honours of the brave Acquire a double horror as they wave. The southern warriors stretch the lines of war Full on the right, obedient to Dumbar. Hardened to manhood in the school of arms, He moves along sedately as he forms: Next deeply stretch their regular array, To break the iron tempest of the day, The sons of Lennox, and their gallant Grahame, Oft honoured with the bloody spoils of fame. He towers along with unaffected pride, Whilst they display their blazing arms aside. Great Somerled possest the middle space, And ranged the kindred valour of his race; The dauntless sons of Morchuan's rocky soil, And the rough manhood of Mull's sea-girt isle. The mountain-chiefs, in burning arms incased, And carrying all their country in their breast, Undaunted rear their useful arms on high, Now fought for food, and now for liberty, Now met the sport of hills, now of the main, Here pierced a stag, and there transfixed a Dane. Though nature's walls their homely huts inclose; To guard their homely huts, though mountains rose; Yet feeling Albion in their breasts, they dare From rocks to rush, and meet the distant war. The full-formed lines now crown the mountain's brow, And wave a blazing forest o'er the foe. The king commands: down in array they creep; Their clanking arms beat time to every step; As they descend, they stretch along the strand, Restore the ranks, and make a solemn stand. Before the camp the Danish columns rise, And stretch the battle to the clarion's voice. Majestic Sueno kept the higher place, Great in the war, as in his noble race; And, when the sword to milder peace shall yield, In council great, as in the thundering field. Behind their king, to either hand afar, Rough Norway's sons extend the front of war. He moves, incased in steel and majesty, Along the ranks, and plans them with his eye; Speaks his commands with unaffected ease, And unconcerned the coming battle sees. Bent on his purpose, obstinately brave, To win a kingdom, or an honest grave, He seemed to look tow'rds Norway's rocky shore, And say,—I'll conquer, or return no more. Far to the right fierce Magnus' fiery sway Compels the troops, and rears the quick array: Haughty he moves, and catching flame from far, Looks tow'rds the Scots, anticipates the war; Feels cruel joys in all his fibres rise, And gathers all his fury to his eyes. Young Haco on the left the battle rears, And moves majestic through a wood of spears; With martial skill the rising ranks he forms, No novice in the iron-trade of arms. Thus formed, the Danes, in unconfused array, Stretch their long lines along the murmuring sea. Their anchored ships, a sable wood, behind, Nod on the wave, and whistle to the wind. On either side thus stretched the manly line; With darting gleam the steel-clad ridges shine: On either side the gloomy lines incede, Foot rose with foot, and head advanced with head. Thus when two winds descend upon the main, To fight their battles on the watery plain, In two black lines the equal waters crowd, On either side the white-topped ridges nod. At length they break, and raise a bubbling sound, While echo rumbles from the rocks around. Thus march the Danes, with spreading wings afar; Thus moves the horror of the Scottish war; While drowsy silence droops her mournful head, Whose calm repose the clanking arms invade. The mountain-youth, with unaffected pride, Twice thirty warriors rising by his side, His native band, precedes the Scottish forms, A shining column in the day of arms. In act to throw, he holds the ponderous spear, And views with awful smiles the face of war. Nodding along, his polished helmet shines, And looks superior o'er the subject lines. On either side, devoured the narrow ground The moving troops. The hostile ridges frowned. From either host the herald's awful breath Rung, in the trumpet's throat, the peal of death. The martial sound foments their kindling rage; Onward they rush, and in a shout engage. The swords through air their gleaming journeys fly, Crash on the helms, and tremble in the sky. Groan follows groan, and wound succeeds on wound, While dying bodies quiver on the ground. Thus, when devouring hatchet-men invade, With sounding steel, the forest's leavy head, The mountains ring with their repeated strokes; The tapering firs, the elms, the aged oaks, Quake at each gash; then nod the head and yield, Groan as they fall, and tremble on the field. Thus fell the men; blood forms a lake around, While groans and spears hoarse harmony resound. The mountains hear, and thunder back the noise, And echo stammers with unequal voice. As yet the battle hung in doubtful scales; Each bravely fought, in death or only fails. All, all are bent on death or victory, Resolved to conquer, or with glory die. Fierce Denmark's honour kindles fire in these; On these pale Albion bends her parent-eyes. This sternly says, “Shall Denmark's children fly?” But that, “Or save, or with your country die.” The Scots, a stream, would sweep the Danes away, The Danes, a rock, repelled the Scots array. They fight alternate, and alternate fly, Both wound, both conquer, both with glory die. Thrice Haco strove to break Dumbar's array, And thrice Dumbar impelled him to the sea. The fiery Magnus, foaming on the right, Pours on the mountain-chiefs his warrior might. The mountain-youths the furious chief restrain, And turn the battle back upon the Dane. The ranks of Sueno stand in firm array, As hoary rocks repel the raging sea. The hero to the phalanx crowds his might, And calmly manages the standing fight; Not idly madd'ning in the bloody fray, He wears delib'rately the foe away. Straight on his spear the godlike Alpin stood, His flaming armour 'smeared with Danish blood. He casts behind an awe-commanding look, And to his few, but valiant, followers spoke: “The cautious Danes, O friends! in firm array, With perseverance may secure the day; Our people fall. Let us their force divide; Invade with flame their transports on the tide. They will defend, the Scots restore the day; Follow, my friends, your Alpin leads the way!” He said, and rushed upon the phalanxed Dane; The bending ranks beneath his sword complain. Arms, groans of men, beat time to every wound, Nod at each blow, and thunder on the ground. Behind his friends advance with martial care, Move step for step, and spread the lane of war. He lowers before, and clears the rugged road; They rush behind, a rough and headlong flood. Thus on some eminence the lab'ring swain Unlocks his sluice to drench the thirsty plain; With mattock armed, he shapes the water's course; The liquid flows behind with rapid force. Thus valiant Alpin hews his bloody way, And thus his friends force through their firm array; With great effort he seizes on the strand, Turns to his friends, and issues his command: “Thicken your lines, the battle's shock sustain, And gall with vigour the recoiling Dane. Brave Caledonians! face your country's foe; Your lives are hers, her own on her bestow.” He added not. The valiant youths obey; The hero shaped along his rapid way; Rushed to the camp, and seized a flaming brand, Then took his lofty seat upon the strand. Swift from his arm the crackling ember flies, Whizzes along, and kindles in the skies: The pitchy hull receives the sparkling fire; The kindling ship the fanning winds inspire. Black smoke ascends; at length the flames arise, Hiss through the shrouds, and crackle in the skies. The riding fleet is all in darkness lost, Its canvas wings the flame spreads on the blast. Red embers, falling from the burning shroud, Hiss in the wave, and bubble in the flood. Great Sueno turns, and sees the flame behind Swell its huge columns on the driving wind; Then thus to Eric: “Urge your speedy flight, Recal the fiery Magnus from the right: Quick let him come! th' endanger'd transports save, And dash against the burning ship the wave.” The youth obeys, and, flying o'er the sand, Repeats in Magnus' ear the king's command. The warrior starts, rage sparkling in his eyes, He towers along, resounding as he flies. He comes: from Sueno's army squadrons fall Around the chief, and rear the manly wall; Till in their front the stately chief appears, They wave behind an iron wood of spears; In all the gloomy pomp of battle lower, And beat with sounding steps the fatal shore. Bent to support the flame, his thin array Young Alpin draws along the murmuring sea. He holds the massy spear in act to throw, And bends his fiery eyes upon the foe. Advanced,—with awful din the fight began; Steel speaks on steel, man urges upon man. Groans, shouts, arms, men, a jarring discord sound, Gain on the sky, and shake the mountains round. Fierce Magnus here would rush into the main; Young Alpin there would keep at bay the Dane. One pushes the swift boat into the sea; Through his bent back the faulchion cleaves its way: Another dashes to the ship the wave, And bends at once into a watery grave; Spouts with departing breath the bubbling flood, And dyes the water with his foaming blood. Thus fought the men.—Behind the flame resounds, Gains on the fleet, and spreads its wasteful bounds. Great Magnus, burning at the dismal sight, Advanced, with rage redoubled, to the fight. “Degen'rate Danes!” the raging warrior cries, “The day is lost,—your fame, your honour, dies! Advance,—condense your ranks,—bear on your way, And sweep these daring striplings to the sea.” The men advance: proceeds their haughty lord, And wounds the air with his impatient sword. Bending where Alpin reapt the bloody plain, “Turn! here's a man; turn, stripling, here's a Dane!” He said.—The mountain-warrior turns his eyes, Then sternly wheels, and with a blow replies. Great Magnus falling on young Alpin's shield, Adds to the dismal thunder of the field. Revengeful Alpin, with descending blade, Crashes the shining thunder on his head. They aim, defend; their swords, at every stroke, Talk on the way, and gleam along the smoke. At length on Magnus fate deals home a wound; He nods to death, and thunders on the ground. Starting from the wide wound, the bubbling blood Sinks through the sand, and rolls a smoking flood. Prone on the strand, extended every way, Clad o'er with steel, a shining trunk he lay. Thus, on its lofty seat, should winds invade The statue, keeps the mem'ry of the dead, It quakes at every blast, and nods around, Then falls, a shapeless ruin, to the ground. The Danes beholding their commander die, Start from their ranks, and in confusion fly. The youth pursues: the flames behind him roar, Catch all the fleet, and clothe with smoke the shore. Mean time great Sueno, Denmark's valiant king, Round royal Indulph bends the hostile ring. Hemmed in a circle of invading men, They face on every side the closing Dane; Deal blow for blow, and wound return for wound, And bring the staggering en'my to the ground. Great Somerled, Argyle's majestic lord, Through Harald's sounding helmet drives his sword: Staggering he falls; his rattling arms resound, And in the pangs of death he bites the ground. Through Hilric's shield great Indulph urged the spear; It pierced his breast, and smoked behind in air: Groaning he sinks; as when repeated strokes Bring headlong to the ground the slaughtered ox. Brave Grahame through mighty Canute urged the spear, Where, 'twixt the helm and mail, the neck was bare. Pressed with the helm his ponderous head inclined, He nodding falls, as trees o'erturned by wind. While thus the en'my's front the chieftains wore, And piled with hostile trunks the fatal shore, By slow degrees their force declines away, Surrounding Denmark gains upon the day. Great Indulph stood amidst the warrior-ring; All give attention to their valiant king: “Hear me, ye chiefs,” the mournful monarch cries, “We fall to-day, our state, our country dies. Let us acquit ourselves of Albion's death, And yield in her defence our latest breath.” He said, and rushed from the surrounding ring, And 'midst the battle sought the Danish king. Ready to fight the royal warriors stood, And longed to revel in each other's blood; While Alpin, rushing from the flaming shore, With wasteful path pursued the flying power, Hewed through great Sueno's ring his bloody way, And to the desp'rate chieftains gave the day, Rushed 'twixt great Indulph and bold Sueno's sword, And with his royal life preserved his lord. Brave Sueno nods, falls to the strand, and cries, “O honour! Denmark lost, undone!” and dies. But still fierce Denmark made a broken stand; Here stands a squadron, there a gloomy band Rears a firm column on the smoky shore, Makes the last efforts of a dying power. Thus, after fire through lanes its way has took, A prostrate village lies o'erwhelmed in smoke; But here and there some sable turrets stand, And look, a dismal ruin, o'er the land. So stood the Danes; but, soon o'erpowered, they fly, Stumble along, and in their flight they die. Norvegia's sons, of Magnus' fire bereft, Fell down before the chieftains of the left. The great Dumbar, upon the right, repelled Young Haco's force, and swept him off the field: He winds his hasty march along the coast, Fights as he flies, and shields his little host. At length, within a wood o'ershades the sea, With new-felled oaks he walls his thin array; Bent on his fate, and obstinately brave, There marked at once his battle-field and grave. CANTO III. As when, beneath the night's tempestuous cloud, Embattled winds assail the leafy wood, Tear on their sable way with awful sound, And bring the groaning forest to the ground: The trunks of elms, the shrub, the fir, the oak, In one confusion sink beneath the shock: So death's sad spoils the bloody field bestrowed; The haughty chieftain, the ignoble crowd, The coward, brave, partake the common wound, Are friends in death, and mingle on the ground. Dark night approachéd: the flaming lord of day Had plunged his glowing circle in the sea; On the blue sky the gath'ring clouds arise, And tempests clap their wings along the skies; The murm'ring voice of heaven, at distance, fails, And eddying whirlwinds howl along the vales; The sky inwrapt in awful darkness lowers, And threatens to descend at once in showers. The Caledonian chiefs, to shun the storm, Beneath a leafy oak their council form. An ancient trunk supports the weary king; The nobles bend around the standing ring. With swords unsheathed the awful forms appeared, Their shining arms with Danish blood besmeared: Their eyes shoot fire; their meins unsettled shew, The battle frowns as yet upon their brow. The monarch rose, and leaning on the oak, Stretched out his hand, and to the nobles spoke: “My lords! the Danes, for so just Heav'n decreed, Even on that shore they thought to conquer, bleed. In vain death wrapt our fathers in his gloom, We raise them, in our actions, from the tomb. Not infamous their aim, o'er lands afar To spread destruction and the plague of war; To meet the sons of battle as they roam, Content to ward them from their native home; To shew invaders that they dared to die, For barren rocks, for fame, and liberty. In you they live, fall'n Denmark's host may shew; Accept my thanks; your country thanks you too.” He added not; but turned his eyes around, Till in the ring the valiant youth he found. “Approach, brave youth!” the smiling monarch cried, “Your country's soldier, and your country's pride. Scotland shall thank thee for this gallant strife, While grateful Indulph owes to thee his life.” Thus he, advancing; and with ardour prest The gallant warrior to his royal breast. The unpresumptuous Alpin bends his eyes, And, mixed with blushes, to the king replies: “To save our king, our country's ancient throne, Are debts incumbent on her every son; O monarch! add it not to Alpin's praise, That of this gen'ral debt his part he pays.” Thus said the youth, and modestly retired, While, as he moves, the king and chiefs admired: Slow to his stand his easy steps he bears, And hears his praises with unwilling ears. The king resumes: “O chiefs, O valiant peers! Glad Caledonia dries her running tears: The warrior raised his faulchion o'er her head Now sleeps forgotten on an earthen bed. Fierce Scandinavia's fatal storms are o'er, Her thunderbolts lie harmless on the shore. But as when, after night has beat a storm, On the mild morn some spots the sky deform, The broken clouds from every quarter sail, Join their black troops, and all the heavens veil; The winds arise, descends the sluicy rain, The storm, with force redoubled, beats the plain: So, when the youthful Haco shall afar Collect the broken fragments of the war, The hero, armed with Sueno's death, may come, And claim an expiation on his tomb. Deep in that wood the gallant warrior lies: Who shall to-night his little camp surprise, Surround the martial Dane with nightly care, And give the final stroke to dying war: Hence Norway's ships shall shun our fatal sea, And point the crooked beak another way; If chance they spy where oft their armies fell, Shall turn the prow, and crowd away the sail.” He said no more: the gen'rous chiefs arise, Bent on the glory of the enterprise. Eager to climb through dang'rous paths to fame, The nightly war they severally claim. One chief observed where godlike Haco lay; This knew the wood, and that the dusky way: Another urged his more unwearied friends; And every chieftain something recommends. Thus for the arduous task the chiefs contest, While each would grasp the danger to his breast. Th' attentive monarch heard their brave debates, And with a secret joy his soul dilates. Young Alpin burns to urge the war of night, To mix again with Haco in the fight. Eager he stood, and thus the chiefs addressed, The warrior lab'ring in his manly breast: “King! gallant chiefs! this enterprise I claim; Here let me fix my unestablished fame. Already you have beat her arduous path, Reaped glorious harvests in the fields of death: Repeated feats fixed fame within your power, But I gleam once, then sink, and am no more. Nor am I wholly ign'rant of the fight, I've urged the gloomy battles of the night: Æbudæ's chief once touched on Abria's strand, And swept our mountains with his pilf'ring band; All day they drove our cattle to the sea, I went at midnight, and rescued the prey; With a poor handful, and a faithful sword, Dispersed the robbers and their haughty lord. 'Twas I commanded—these the gallant men! May we not act that midnight o'er again?” The hero spoke: a murm'ring voice ensued Of loud applause: each hero's mind subdued, The glorious danger to the youth resigns: He tow'rs along, and marshals up his lines. Some gallant youths, to share his fame, arise, And mingle in the glorious enterprise. The warrior-band move on in firm array; He tow'rs before along the sounding sea. Through their tall spears the singing tempest raves, And falling headlong on the spumy waves, Pursues the ridgy sea with awful roar, And throws the liquid mountains on the shore. In each short pause, before the billow breaks, The clanking Caledonian armour speaks. Thus on some night when sable tempests roar, The watchman wearying of his lonely hour, Hears some rent branch to squeak 'twixt every blast, But in each ruder gust the creak is lost. The king and gallant chiefs, with wishful eyes, Pursue the youthful warrior as he flies. His praise through all the noble circle ran; Approached the ghastly figure of a man: His visage pale; his locks are bleached with years; His tott'ring steps he onward scarcely bears: His limbs are laced with blood, a hideous sight! And his wet garments shed the tears of night. With slow approach he lifts his fading eyes, And raised the squeaking treble of his voice. “O king! I feel the leaden hand of death, To the dark tomb I tread the gen'ral path: Hear me, O king! for this I left the field, For this to thee my dying form revealed: Norway in vain had interposed her flood, I come, alas! to pay the debt of blood. Possessed of crimes, which the good king pursued, In fell conspiracy, unblest! I vowed With fierce Dovalus; that I live to tell! By us, by us, the great king Malcolm fell! Touched with remorse, behind my shield I laid His smiling child, and wrapt him in my plaid. Now to the sea we urge our rapid flight, Beneath the guilty mantle of the night. Still in my arms I little Duffus bear; Behind the voice of men and arms we hear. My comrades fly.—I lay the infant down, And with my guilty life from vengeance run. They found him, sav'd him; for I knew the voice: It was”—He said, and closed at once his eyes; Slowly inclined, and tumbling headlong down, His guilty life breathed in a feeble groan. The mournful monarch stood in dumb surprise; The fate of Malcolm filled afresh his eyes. He folds his arms, and bends his silent look, Then, starting from the gloom of sorrow, spoke: “You see, my lords, though Denmark's hostile state Long saved the traitors from the hand of fate; Yet, heaven, who rules with equal sway beneath, Snatched from her arms a victim due to death; Dovalus shall not sink among the dead, But with that vengeance hangs o'er treason's head. Still, Malcolm, still, thou gen'rous, and thou best! Thy fate hangs heavy on a brother's breast; You left a young, you left a helpless son, But lost to me, to Scotland, and his throne. Perhaps, oppressed with hunger and with cold, He tends some peasant's cattle to the fold; Or fights a common soldier on the field, And bows beneath the sceptre he should wield.” No more he said: the noble circle sighed; They droop the silent head, nor aught replied. Now died apace the occidental light; The subject world receives the flood of night. The king from every side his troops recalls; They fall around and rear their manly walls. He issues to return the great command, They move along, and leave the fatal strand. The city gained, each soldier's weary breast Forgets the day, and sooths his toil with rest. The king receives, with hospitable care, The gallant chiefs, and drowns in wine the war. Within the royal hall the nobles sat; The royal hall in simple nature great. No pigmy art, with little mimicry, Distracts the sense, or pains the weary eye: Shields, spears, and helms, in beauteous order shone, Along the walls of uncemented stone. Here all the noble warriors crown the bowl, And with the gen'rous nectar warm the soul; With social talk steal lazy time away, Recounting all the dangers of the day: They turn to Alpin, and the gloomy fight, And toast the gallant warrior of the night. Meantime young Alpin 'girts the fatal wood, And longs to mix again with Danish blood. Already Haco had, with martial care, With walls of oak embraced an ample square: Himself beneath a tree the storm defends, And keeps in arms around his watchful friends. The fair Aurelia by the hero's side, An awful warrior, and a blooming bride, Who placed in martial deeds her virgin care, Wields in her snowy hand the ashen spear. A silver mail hung round her slender waist, The corslet rises on her heaving breast. On her white arm the brazen buckler shows, The shining helm embraced her marble brows; Her twining ringlets flowing down behind, Sung grateful music to the nightly wind. Fate was unkind: just as the lovers wed, Nor yet had tasted of the nuptial bed; Great Sueno's trumpet called the youth to war, He sighed, embraced, and left the weeping fair. With love emboldened, up the virgin rose, From her soft breast the native woman throws; And with the gallant warrior clothes the wife, Following her Haco to the bloody strife. She sought her love through war's destructive path, And often turned from him the hand of death. The chief, attentive, all the youth surveyed, And in the warrior found the lovely maid. She leans inclining on her martial spear, And only for the youth employs her fear. The valiant Scot assails the oaken wall: The bulwark groans, the brave defenders fall. With sounding steel the firm barrier he plied, And poured his warriors in on every side. The godlike Haco, rushing through the night, Now here, now there, opposed th' invaders' might; To every corner gave divided aid, Still, still supported by the martial maid. Thus when the ocean, swelling o'er the strand, Invades with billowy troops the subject land, The sed'lous swains the earthen weight oppose, And fill the fissures where the tempest flows; So valiant Haco flew to every side, And stemmed with pointed steel the manly tide; With great effort preserved the narrow field, And 'twixt the fair and danger kept the shield. She, only she, employs the hero's care; Haco forgot, he only thinks on her. He longs to sink with glory to the dead, But can he leave in grief the captive maid? Her dying image hags his fancy's eyes, What should he do, if fair Aurelia dies? Love, mighty love, arrested all his pow'r; He wished for flight, who never fled before. But as the lioness, to save her young, Despises death, and meets the hunter-throng; So, starting from the sable maze of care, He faces death, and shields the lovely fair. The martial maid, with equal love possessed, Would dart 'twixt danger and her Haco's breast, Oppose her buckler to the lifted spear, And turn from him the iron hand of war. Now godlike Alpin hewed his bloody path Through Danish ranks, and marked his steps with death. Th' inclosed square with desp'rate hand he shears, And reaps a bloody field of men and spears. Groans, crashing steel, and clangour of the fight, Increase the stormy chorus of the night. The Danes, diminished, meet the unequal war, Where two fall'n oaks confine an inner square; Join their broad shields, the close-wedged column rear, And on the Scottish battle turn the spear. On every side the Caledonians close, Hemming the desp'rate phalanx of the foes, To give the final stroke to battle crowd, While Haco thus bespoke the Danes aloud: “Ye sons of North, unfortunate, though brave! Here fate has marked out our common grave, Has doomed our bodies to enrich these plains: Then die revenged—like warriors and like Danes!” He spoke, and turning to the martial maid, Embraced her softly, and thus sighing said: “Shall then my spouse, my love, my only joy, Shall fair Aurelia with her Haco die? Thy death afflicts me.—I in vain complain; I'll save Aurelia, or expire—a Dane!” He said, and, gath'ring up his spacious shield, Prepared to meet the battle in the field. Young Alpin heard. It touched his feeling breast, He stopped the war, and thus the Dane addressed: “Our Caledonia, now relieved of fear, Feels pity rising in the place of care, Disdains to tyrannise o'er vanquished foes, And for her steel on them her pity throws. I now dismiss brave Haco from the field, And own the gen'rous present of the shield.” He said: his thanks returns the royal Dane, Himself escorts them to the sounding main. A ship escaped the flame, within a bay, Where bending rocks exclude the rougher sea, Secure from stormy winds in safety rides, And slowly nods on the recoiling tides: Thither they bend, and launching to the sea, Plow with the crooked beak the wat'ry way; Their sable journey to the North explore, And leave their sleeping friends upon the shore. CANTO IV. The sprightly morn, with early blushes spread, Rears o'er the eastern hills her rosy head: The storm subsides; the breezes, as they pass, Sigh on their way along the pearly grass. Sweet carol all the songsters of the spray; Calm and serene comes on the gentle day. Amidst attendant fair Culena moves, Culena, fruit of Indulph's nuptial loves! Too soon to fate the beauteous queen resigned, But left the image of herself behind. To the calm main the lovely nymphs repair, To breathe along the strand the morning air; They brush with easy steps the dewy grass, Observing beauteous nature as they pass. Th' imperial maid moves with superior grace; Awe mixed with mildness sat upon her face; High inbred virtue all her bosom warms, In beauty rises, and improves her charms. Silent and slow she moves along the main, Behind, her maids attend, a modest train! Observe her as she moves with native state, And gather all their motions from her gait. Thus through Idalia's balm-distilling grove, Majestic moves the smiling queen of love: Her hair flows down her snowy neck behind, Her purple mantle floats upon the wind; The Graces move along, a blooming train! And borrow all the gestures of their queen. Thus steal the lovely maids their tardy way Along the silent border of the sea. Slow-curling waves advance upon the main, And often threat the shore, and oft abstain. A woody mound, which reared aloft its head, Threw trembling shadows o'er a narrow mead: From a black rock crystalline waters leap, Arch as they fall, and through the valley creep, Chide with the murmuring pebbles as they pass, Or hum their purling journey through the grass. Pleased with the scene the wand'ring virgins stood; The main below, above the lofty wood. Their eyes they sate with the transporting scene, And, sitting, press the fair-enamel'd green; Enjoy with innocence the growing day, And steal with harmless talk the time away. Meantime fierce Corbred, who preferred in vain His suit to Agnes, fairest of the train, Who fled from Tweed to shun his hated arms, Entrusting fair Culena with her charms; Saw the disdainful nymph remote from aid, And bent his lustful eyes upon the maid. He rushed with headlong ruffians from the wood, And seized the fair: the virgins shriek aloud. For help, for help, the struggling virgin cries, And as she shrieks, aloud the wood replies. Alpin alone, (his men were sent before), Stalked on his thoughtful way along the shore. The distant plaint assailed the hero's ear, He drew his sword, and rushed to save the fair. Before the chief the dastard Corbred fled, And to her brave preserver left the maid. Prostrate on earth the lovely virgin lay, Her roses fade, and all her charms decay: In humid rest her bending eye-lids close; With slow returns her bosom fell and rose: At length returning life her bosom warms, Glows in her cheeks, and lights up all her charms. Thus, when invading clouds the moon assail, The landscape fails, and fades the shining vale; But soon as Cynthia rushes on the sight, Reviving fields are silvered o'er with light. Th' affrighted fair the gallant warrior leads, To join, upon the sand, the flying maids. They crowd their cautious steps along the sea, Quake at each breath, and tremble on their way; Their tim'rous breasts unsettled from surprise, To every side they dart their careful eyes. Thus, on the heathy wild the hunted deer Start at each blast, together crowd through fear, Tremble and look about, before, behind, Then stretch along, and leave the mountain-wind. The gallant youth presents the rescued fair, Confirms their trembling breasts, removes their care; The gen'rous story from herself they hear, And drink his praises with a greedy ear; Steal on the youth their eyes, as Agnes spoke, And pour their flutt'ring souls at every look. But fair Culena feels a keener dart; It pierced her breast, and sunk into her heart: She hears attentive, views, admires, and loves, Her eye o'er all the man with pleasure roves. With painful joy she feels the flame increase, Her pride denies it, but her eyes confess: She starts, and blushing turns her eye aside, But love steps in, and steals a look from pride. Thus fair Culena struggles up the stream, And 'tempts in vain to quench the rising flame. At length, with blushing cheek and bending look, Th' imperial maid the warrior thus bespoke: “O gen'rous chief! for thus your deeds would say, How shall our gratitude thy kindness pay? Indulph shall hear, and Indulph shall reward; Such gen'rous actions claim a king's regard.” She said; and thus the chief: “Imperial maid, More than the debt thy approbation paid. In this I did not strive with gallant men, Or drive disordered squadrons from the plain; But frighted from his prey a sensual slave; The gloomy sons of guilt are never brave. Whoe'er would seize on a defenceless fair, Would shun the sword, and fly amain from war.” He said, and stalked away with manly state; Grandeur, with awe commixed, informed his gait. His pond'rous mail reflects the trembling day, And all his armour rings along the way. The royal maid observes him as he flies, In silence stands, and from her bosom sighs, Slowly moves on before the silent fair, And in the palace shuts her secret care. Meantime young Alpin seeks the king and peers; But fair Culena in his bosom bears. In vain against the rising flame he strove, For all the man dissolved at once to love. Within the high-arched hall the nobles sat, And formed in council the reviving state; For instant peace solicitous prepare, And raise a bulwark 'gainst the future war. No high-flown zeal the patriot hurled along, No secret gold engaged the speaker's tongue; No jarring seeds are by a tyrant sown, Nor cunning senate undermines the throne. To public good their public thoughts repair, And Caledonia is the gen'ral care. No orator in pompous phrases shines, Or veils with public weal his base designs. Truth stood conspicuous, undisguised by art; They spoke the homely language of the heart. Arrived the gallant warrior of the night; They hear with eager joy the gloomy fight. His conduct, courage, and compassion raise, And every voice is forward in his praise. The great Dumbar his awful stature rears, His temples whitened with the snow of years. On the brave youth he bends his solemn look, Then, turning round, thus to the nobles spoke: “Beneath the royal banner, Scots afar Had urged on Humber's banks the foreign war; My father dead, though young I took the shield, And led my kindred warriors to the field. The noble Caledonian camp was laid Within the bosom of a spacious mead. Green-rising hills encompassed it around, And these king Malcolm with his archers crowned; Full on the right a spacious wood arose, And thither night conveyed a band of foes. The king commands a chief to clear the wood, And I the dang'rous service claim aloud. I went, expelled the foes, and killed their lord, And ever since have worn his shining sword. I now retire from war, in age to rest; Take it, brave youth, for you can wield it best.” He said, and reached the sword. The youth replied, Shooting the heavy blade athwart his side: “My lord, with gratitude this sword I take, Esteem the present for the giver's sake. It still may find the way it oft explored, And glut with hostile blood its second lord; To bloody honour hew its wasteful path, A faithful sickle in the fields of death.” He thus. With placid mein great Indulph rose, And spoke: “Thus always meet our Albion's foes; With foreign blood your native arms adorn, And boldly fight for ages yet unborn. For us, my lords, fought all our godlike sires; The debt we owe to them our race requires: Though future arms our country should enslave, She shall acquit our ashes in the grave; Posterity degen'rate, as they groan, Shall bless their sires, and call their woes their own. Let us, my lords, each virtuous spark inspire, And where we find it, blow it to a fire. Thy service, gallant Alpin, in this war, Shall both be Indulph's and the senate's care. Meantime, with manly sports and exercise, Let us from bus'ness turn the mental eyes: The mind relaxed acquires a double force, And with new vigour finishes the course.” He added not: the godlike chiefs obey; All rise at once; great Indulph leads the way. The palace here, and there a virid mound, Confine a flow'ry spot of grassy ground. The under-rock, emerging through the green, Chequers with hoary knobs the various scene. Thither repair the chiefs and sceptered king, And bend upon the plain the hollow ring. Obedient servants from the palace bear The horny bow, the helm, the shining spear, The mail, the corslet, and the brazen shield; And throw the ringing weight upon the field. Imperial Indulph, tow'ring o'er the plain, With placid words addressed the warrior train: “Let those who bend the stubborn bow arise, And with the feathered shaft dispute the prize; An antique bow a Balearian wore, When Romans thundered on our Albion's shore. The skilful archer, dealing death afar, Threw on our Scottish host the distant war; Great Fergus springs, a king devoid of fear, And through his body shoots the reeking spear; The bloody spoil through striving cohorts brings, And sends this relic down to after kings.” Thus, grasping the long bow, the monarch said: Rose valiant Grahame and youthful Somerled. Next Gowal in the strife demands a part, Famed on his native hills to wing the dart. Full on the mound a helm, their aim, was placed; And Gowal drew the nerve first to his breast; The bow reluctant yields, then backward springs; The nerve resounds, through air the arrow sings. Close to the aim, the earth the arrow meets, And, as it vibrates, the bright helmet beats. Applause ensues. The shaft was sent by Grahame, And cut its brazen journey through the aim. The prize on him the murm'ring chiefs bestow, Till Somerled assumes the ancient bow. The dancing chord the leaping arrow left, And, rushing, took on end Grahame's birchen shaft; Tore on its way, around the shivers fly, And Somerled brings off the prize with joy. “Who,” cries the king, “this shield his prize shall bear, And fling with skilful hand the martial spear? Behind this buckler mighty Kenneth stood, When Tay, impurpled, ran with Pictish blood.” He said, and placed a mark, the knobby round, And measured back with equal steps the ground. The valiant Grahame, the mountain-youth, arose; Gowal again his martial stature shows; Bent on the knobby splendour of the prize, First from his hand the singing weapon flies. The steel-head marked a circle as it run, Flamed with the splendour of the setting sun. Thus when the night the weeping sky o'er-veils, Athwart the gloom the streaming meteor sails, Kindles a livid circle as it flies, And with its glory dazzles human eyes. Thus flew the spear, and sinking in the mound, With quick vibrations beat the air around; But missed the shield. Grahame's not unpractised art Dismisses through the air the murm'ring dart: Full on the middle boss it takes the shield; The fighting metals clatter o'er the field: From the firm knob the point obliquely flies, And on the field the trembling weapon lies. Next valiant Alpin takes the pond'rous spear, And bending back dismisses it through air: The long quick weapon flying o'er the field, Falls on the boss, and perforates the shield; The waving shaft is planted on the mound; And with applause the neighbouring rocks resound. Young Somerled wrenched from the rock a quoit, A huge, enormous, sharp, unweildy weight; Such now-a-days as many panting swains A witness rear on long-contested plains: Slow-bending down, at length the hero springs; The rolling rock along the heavens sings; Falling, it shakes at once the neighb'ring ground, And on the face of earth indents a wound. Thus when strong winds the aged tow'r invade, And throw the shapeless ruin from its head; It falls, and cleaves its bed into the ground; The valley shakes, and rocks complain around. All try the mark to reach, but try in vain; All falling short, unequal wound the plain. Alpin with diffidence assumes the stone, For such a space had Somerled o'erthrown: Th' unwieldy rock a while he weighs with care, Then springing sends it whizzing through the air; The wond'ring warriors view it as it rolls; Far o'er the distant mark the discus falls; It shakes the plain, and deals a gaping wound, Such as when headlong torrents tear the ground. Th' applauding chiefs own in the manly game The hero great as in the fields of fame. Culena, leaning on her snowy arms, Observant from the window points her charms. Th' imperial virgin saw with pleasant pain, The fav'rite youth victorious on the plain: Sadly she sighed, accusing cruel fate, Which chained her in captivity of state. The veil of night had now inwrapt the pole; The feast renewed, goes round the sparkling bowl. Great Indulph rose with favour-speaking mein; Approaching Alpin thus the king began: “Say, will the stranger tell from whence he came, To reap this harvest of unrivalled fame? Nobler the youth, who, though before unknown, From merit mounts to virtue and renown, Than he, set up by an illustrious race, Totters aloft, and scarce can keep his place!” The monarch spoke: attentive look the peers, And long to drink his voice with greedy ears. CANTO V. The hero, rising from his lofty seat, Thus unpresumptuously accosts the great: “The fame of Denmark passed our mountains o'er, And filled our ears on Abria's distant shore: Brave Rynold starts: the aged chief alarms, And kindles all his family to arms. A hundred youths, who, from the sounding wood, Or towering mountain, brought their living food, Obey the bag-pipe's voice; for all in view Of Rynold's seat, the friendly canton grew. The hoary warrior leads the onward path, No stranger to the road which led to death. Behind advancing, I, with martial care, Lead on the youthful thunder-bolts of war; With arms anticipate the kindling fire, And move to every motion of my sire. “On Grampus night her mantle round us throws; We slept on heath; the dappled morn arose: Descending thence, pursue our headlong way, And cross the silver errors of the Tay. Groans, feeble shrieks, ascending from the vale, Speak on the pinions of the southern gale. A dismal scene breaks on our distant eyes; Here one pursues, and there another flies. This breathes his life through the impurpled wound, While his proud villa smokes along the ground. That with the foe maintains unequal strife, While his dear offspring fly, and dearer wife. “The senior saw it with indignant eyes, And bid, at once, his kindred ranks arise. With hasty steps we seize a virid brow, And form a sable cloud above the foe. Thus on the mountain's brow, I oft have seen The mustering clouds brew torrents for the plain; At length the blustering south begins to roar, And heaven descends impetuous in a shower; The bubbling floods foam down the hill, and spread A swimming deluge on the subject mead. “Thus Rynold formed on the mountain's brow, And headlong rushed into the vale below, While on the banks of Tay terrific shine The steel-clad foe, and stretch the hostile line. They form a wall along the flowing flood, And awful gleam their arms, an iron wood. We shout, and rush upon the hostile throng: The echoing fields with iron clangour rung. Firm stood the foe, nor made they flight their care, But hand to hand returned the equal war: Man close to man, and shield conjoined to shield, They with the stable phalanx keep the field. With pointed spear I marked the stoutest foe, And Heaven directed home the happy blow: He tumbles backward to the groaning flood: Tay circles round, and mingles with his blood. My kindred youth their useful weapons wield, Fomenting the confusion of the field. Dane fell on Dane, and man transfixed his man, Till bloody torrents smoaked along the plain. At length they fly along the banks of Tay; Their guilty leader points th' inglorious way. Eager we follow. Still the foe with art Wound as they fly, and shoot th' inverted dart. Rynold is wounded. Still he urged the foe; While down his limbs the crimson torrents flow: With eager voice he still foments the strife, Preferring Albion's liberty to life. “An ancient pile upreared its reverend head, And from its lofty seat surveyed a mead: The mouldering walls confessed their beauty past; A fragment falls with each invading blast. Old arms above the gate time's empire own; The rampant lion moulders in the stone: Tall elms around, an old and shattered band, Their naked arms erect, like sentries stand. “Within the ruined walls their fear inclose The desp'rate squadrons of the flying foes. An ancient plane, whose leaf-dismantled weight Rude winds o'erturned, secures the shapeless gate. On every side my quick array I form, Prepared at once the muniment to storm. Missing my sire, I fly to find the chief, And give the wounded all a son's relief. “Far on the plain the wounded warrior creeps, And scarcely moves along his tottering steps; But still, far as his feeble voice could bear, He kindles with his words the distant war. Quick I approached. He first the silence broke; And leaning on his lance the warrior spoke:” ‘Say, why returns young Alpin from the fight? Pursue the foe, and urge the Danish flight. I sink, my son, I sink into the grave; You cannot me, your country, Alpin, save.’ “No more he said. I mournful thus reply, Compassion melting in my filial eye: ‘O sire, the Danes, within yon walls secured, Will share our pity, or must feel our sword: Of filial duty what his wants require, I come to offer for a dying sire.’ “He thus returns: ‘Still good, still generous mind! My wants are, Alpin, of no earthly kind: The world, the fading world, retires from view; Earth cloys me now, and all it has, but you. Go, Alpin, go; within that lofty wood A hermit lives, a holy man and good! Relieve, my son, relieve me of my cares, And for the dying Rynold raise his prayers.’ “This said, himself the wounded warrior laid Within the coolness of a birchen shade: Some youths around employ their friendly care, And o'er the dying shed the mournful tear. Around the ancient fastness guards I sent, And to the lofty wood my journey bent. Two rising hills, whose brows tall poplars grace, With stretching arms a woody plain embrace; Along the tree-set vale a riv'let flowed, And murmured softly through the under-wood: Along the purling stream my steps I bear, And seek the lonely mansions of the seer. Irreg'lar files of towering elms embrace, In their calm bosom, an enamelled space. Full at the end a rock, with sable arms Stretched o'er a moss-grown cave, a grotto forms. A silver stream, clear issuing from the stones, In winding mazes through the meadow runs; Depending flowers their varied colours bind, Hang o'er the entrance, and defend the wind. On a green bank the holy seer is laid, Where weaving branches cloud the chequered shade; In solemn thought his hoary head's inclined, And his white locks wave in the fanning wind. “With reverend steps approaching, I began: ‘O blest with all that dignifies the man! Who, far from life, and all its noisy care, Enjoy'st the aim of all that wander there: Let, holy father, thy propitious aid Guide dying Rynold through the deathful shade.’ “I said: the prophet heavenward lifts his eyes, Long fixed in solemn thought, and thus replies: ‘Vain mortals! worms of earth! how can ye dare To deem your deeds not Providence's care? Heaven looks on all below with equal eye; They long escape, but yet the wicked die. With distant time, O youth! my soul's imprest; Futurity is lab'ring in my breast: Thy blood, which rolling down from Fergus came, Passes through time, a pure untainted stream. Albion shall in her pristine glory shine, And, blessed herself, bless the Fergusian line. ‘But, ah! I see grim treason rear its head, Pale Albion trembling, and her monarch dead; The tyrant wield his sceptre 'smeared with blood— O base return! but still great Heaven is good: He falls, he falls; see how the tyrant lies! And Scotland brightens up her weeping eyes: The banished race again resume their own, Nor Syria boasts her royal saint alone. Its gloomy front the lowering season clears, And gently rolls a happy round of years. ‘Again I see contending chiefs come on, And, as they strive to mount, they tear the throne; To civil arms the horrid trumpet calls, And Caledonia by her children falls. The storm subsides to the calm flood of peace; The throne returns to Fergus' ancient race. Glad Caledonia owns their lawful sway; Happy in them, in her unhappy they! See each inwrapped untimely in his shroud, For ever sleeping in his generous blood! Who on thy mournful tomb refrains the tear? O regal charms, unfortunately fair! Dark Faction grasps her in his sable arms, And crushes down to death her struggling charms: The rose, in all its gaudy livery drest, Thus faintly struggles with the blust'ring west. ‘Why mention him in whom th' eternal fates Shall bind in peace the long-discording states? See Scot and Saxon, coalesced in one, Support the glory of the common crown. Britain no more shall shake with native storms, But o'er the trembling nations lift her arms.’ “He spoke, and in the cave inclosed his age: In wonder lost, I leave the hermitage, Measure with thoughtful steps my backward way, While to the womb of night retires the day. Pale doubtful twilight broods along the ground; The forest nods its sleeping head around. “Before my eyes a ghastly vision stood; A mangled man, his bosom stained with blood! Silent and sad the phantom stood confest, And shewed the streaming flood-gates of his breast. Then pointing to the dome his tardy hand, Thither his eyes my silent way command. He hands my sword, emits a feeble groan, And weakly says, ‘Revenge me, O my son!’ I to reply—he hissed his way along, As breezes sing through reeds their shrilly song. I stood aghast, then winged me to obey; Across the field I sweep my hasty way. The men I arm; the firm barrier we ply, And those who dare dispute the passage die. With dying groans the lonely walls resound: I on the guilty leader deal a wound; Through his bright helm the sword its journey takes, He falls, and thus with dying accents speaks: ‘Just Heaven! in vain the wicked shun thy power; Though late thy vengeance, yet the blow is sure. This earth received the blood from off my hands; A just return, my own, my own demands! In night's dead hour, when all but treason slept, With ruffian bands, a bloody train, I crept. 'Twas here, 'twas here, oh! long-deserved death! 'Twas here the godlike man resigned his breath: The sleeping fam'ly we with blood surprise, And send the palace flaming to the skies. I fled, but fled, alas! pursued by fate: 'Tis now I find that I have sinned too late. O Malcolm! O my king! before my eyes He stands confessed;—accursed Dovalus dies.’ “His guilty soul in these dire accents fled; I left with hasty steps the silent dead. Beneath the birch my aged sire I found, His life was ebbing through the purple wound. On me the aged senior lifts his eyes, And mixes feeble accents with his sighs: ‘Alpin, the commerce of this world I leave; Convey my relicks to my father's grave. Ten friendly youths the homely rites shall pay; Lead thou the rest, my Alpin, to the fray: Denmark invades: this was a pilfering band, Who spread divided terror o'er the land.’ “He said: a qualm succeeds; tears fill my eyes, And woe securely shuts the gates of voice; Silent and sad I hang the dying o'er, And with warm tears intenerate his gore. “The chief resumes: ‘My brave, my only son! Yes, Alpin, I may call thee all my own; I shall not veil a secret in my death; Take then this story of my latest breath: The twentieth season liv'ries o'er the year, Since on the Severn's banks I met the war; In private feud, against a Saxon lord, The great Dumbar had raised his kindred sword; I on the foe my bow auxiliar bend, And join afar our fam'ly's ancient friend: Returning thence, I next the Tay divide, That very night the great king Malcolm died. My clan in arms might then preserve their king; But fate withstood; along in arms we ring. An infant's cries, at distance, took my ear, I went, found thee a helpless orphan there.’ The king, who long infixed in dumb surprise, Run o'er the speaking youth with searching eyes, Here stopt him short, his arms around him flung, And silent on th' astonished warrior hung; My son, my son, at last, perplexed, he cries, My Duffus! tears hung in his joyful eyes: The crowding tide of joy his words suppressed; He clasps the youth in silence to his breast. Th' astonished chiefs, congealed in dumb amaze, Stiffened to silence, on each other gaze. Sudden their cheeks are varied with surprise, And glad disorder darted from their eyes. As when before the swains, with instant sound, The forky bolt descending tears the ground; They stand; with stupid gaze each other eye: So stood the chiefs oppressed with sudden joy. At length, relaxed from fetters of surprise, “Welcome, brave youth!” the sceptered senior cries. “Welcome to honours justly thine alone, Triumphant mount, though late, thy father's throne. To thee with joy the sceptre I resign; And waft the kingdom to the coming line.” He said: and thus the youth: “I only know To shoot the spear, and bend the stubborn bow; Unskilled to stretch o'er nations my command, Or in the scales of judgment poise a land. Wield still the sceptre which with grace you wear, And guide with steadier hand the regal car; While, looking up to thee, with humble eye, I first transcribe my future rules of sway; Till late enjoy the throne which you bequeath, And only date dominion from thy death.” Resolved he spoke: bursts of applause around Break on the chiefs: with joy the halls resound. As when some valiant youth returns from far, And leaves the fields of death, and finished war; Whom time and honest scars another made, And friendly hope long placed among the dead; At first his sire looks with indifference on, But soon he knows, and hangs upon his son: So all the chiefs the royal youth embrace; While joys, tumultuous, rend the lofty place. While thus the king and noble chiefs rejoice, Harmonious bards exalt the tuneful voice: A select band by Indulph's bounty fed, To keep in song the mem'ry of the dead! They handed down the ancient rounds of time, In oral story and recorded rhyme. The vocal quire in tuneful concert sings Exploits of heroes, and of ancient kings: How first in Fergus Caledonia rose; What hosts she conquered, and repelled what foes. Through time in reg'lar series they decline, And touch each name of the Fergusian line; Great Caractacus, Fergus' awful sword; That bravely lost his country, this restored: Hibernia's spoils, Gregorius' martial fire; The stern avenger of his murdered sire: Beneath his sword, as yet, whole armies groan, And a whole nation paid the blood of one. At length descend the rough impetuous strains To valiant Duffus, and the slaughtered Danes: The battle lives in verse; in song they wound; And fallen squadrons thunder on the ground. Thus in the strain the bards impetuous roll, And quaff the generous spirit of the bowl, At length from the elab'rate song respire; The chiefs remove, and all to rest retire. CANTO VI. Now in the blushing east the morn arose; Its lofty head in grey the palace shows. Within, the king and valiant chiefs prepare To urge the chace, and wage the mountain-war. The busy menials through the palace go; Some whet the shaft, and others try the bow; This viewed the toils; that taught the horn to sound; Another animates the sprightly hound. For the fleet chace the fair Culena arms, And from the gloom of sorrow 'wakes her charms: The hero's royal birth had reached her ear, And sprightly hope assumed the throne of care. Around her slender waist the cincture slides; Her mantle flows behind in crimson tides. Bright rings of gold her braided ringlets bind; The rattling quiver, laden, hangs behind. She seized, with snowy hand, the polished bow, And moved before, majestically slow. The chiefs behind advance their sable forms, And with dark contrast heighten all her charms. Thus, on expanded plains of heavenly blue, Thick-gathered clouds the queen of night pursue; And as they crowd behind their sable lines, The virgin light with double lustre shines. The maid her glowing charms thus onward bears; His manly height aside young Duffus rears. Her beauty he, his manhood she admires; Both moved along, and fed their silent fires. The hunters to the lofty mountains came: Their eager breasts anticipate the game: The forest they divide, and sound the horn; The generous hounds within their bondage burn, Struggle for freedom, long to stretch away, And in the breeze already find the prey. At the approaching noise the starting deer Croud on the heath, and stretch away in fear, Wave, as they spring, their branchy heads on high, Skim o'er the wild, and leave the aching eye. The eager hounds, unchained, devour the heath; They shoot along, and pant a living death: Gaining upon their journey, as they dart, Each from the herd selects a flying hart. Some urged the bounding stag a different way, And hung with open mouth upon the prey: Now they traverse the heath, and now assail The rising hill, now skim along the vale: Now they appear, now leave the aching eyes; The master follows with exulting cries, Fits, as he flies, the arrow to the string; The rest within the rattling quiver ring: He, as they shoot the lofty mountains o'er, Pursues in thought, and sends his soul before. Thus they with supple joints the chase pursue, Rise on the hills, and vanish on the brow. On the blue heavens arose a night of clouds; The radiant lord of day his glory shrouds: The rushing whirlwind speaks with growling breath, Roars through the hill, and scours along the heath; Deep rolling thunder, rumbling from afar, Proclaims with murmuring voice th' aerial war: Fleet lightnings flash in awful streams of light, Dart through the gloom, and vanish from the sight: The blustering winds through heaven's black concave sound, Rain batters earth, and smokes along the ground. Down the steep hill the rushing torrents run, And cleave with headlong rage their journey on; The lofty mountains echo to the fall; A muddy deluge stagnates on the vale. Culena moved along the level ground; A hart descends before the opening hound: From the recoiling cord she twanged the dart, And pierced the living vigour of the hart: He starts, he springs; but falling as he flies, Pours out his tim'rous soul with weeping eyes. As o'er the dying prey the huntress sighed, Before the wind heaven pours a sable tide, And lowering threats a storm: a rocky cave, Where monks successive hewed their house and grave, Invites into its calm recess the fair: The reverend father breathed abroad his prayer. The valiant Duffus comes with panting breath, Faces the storm and stalks across the heath. His sleeky hounds, a faithful tribe, before, Are bathed with blood, and varied o'er with gore. Drenched with the rain, the noble youth descends, And in the cave the growling storm defends. Amazed, astonished, fixed in dumb surprise, The lovers stood, but spoke with silent eyes: At length the distant colloquy they rear, Run o'er the chace, the mountain, and the deer. Far from the soul th' evasive tongue departs, Their eyes are only faithful to their hearts. The winding volumes of discourse return To hostile fields by gallant Duffus shorn. Th' imperial maid must hear it o'er again, How fell Dovalus was by Duffus slain, How by the son the father's murderer fell. The kindling virgin flames along the tale. She turns, she quakes, and from her bosom sighs, And all her soul comes melting in her eyes. Flames, not unequal, all the youth possess, He, for the first, hears willingly his praise. Praise, harshly heard from warriors, kings, and lords, Came down in balm on fair Culena's words. The royal pair thus fed the mutual fire, Now speak, now pause, when both alike admire. He longs to vent the passion of his soul, And she the tempests in her bosom roll. Now he begun, but shame his voice opprest; Loth to offend, his eyes must tell the rest. At length, upon the headlong passion borne, He spoke his love, and had a kind return; She sighed, she owned, and bent her modest eyes, While blushing roses on her cheeks arise. Thus on the vale the poppy's blushing head, Brim-full of summer-showers, to earth is weighed; Fanned with the rising breeze, it slow inclines, While o'er the mead the rosy lustre shines. Indulph into his cave the hermit led, Found erring through the mountain's stormy head. Culena, starting as the king appears, Looks every way, and trembles as she fears; On her mild face the modest blushes rise, And fair disorder darted from her eyes. The parent king observed the virgin whole, And read the harmless secret in her soul. A while the maze of calm discourse they wind; At length the king unveils his royal mind. “Warded from Albion's head, the storm is o'er; Her prince is found, her foes are now no more: Through time 'tis ours her happiness to trace, 'Tis ours to bind the future bands of peace. Posterity for Albion's crown may fight, And couch ambition in the name of right, With specious titles urge the civil war, And to a crown their guilty journey tear: I end these fears: the streams shall run in one, Nor struggling kindred strive to mount the throne. I shield my daughter with young Duffus' arms, And bless the warrior with Culena's charms.” Thus said the king. Their willing hands they join, The rev'rend priest runs o'er the rites divine. The solemn ceremony closed with pray'r, And Duffus called his own the royal fair. The storm is ceased; the clouds together fly, And clear at once the azure fields of sky; The mid-day sun pours down his sultry flame, And the wet heath waves glist'ring in the beam. The hunter-chiefs appear upon the brow, Fall down the hill, and join the king below; Slow through the narrow vale their steps they bear, Behind advance the spoils of sylvan war. Far on a head-land point condensed they stood, And threw their eyes o'er ocean's sable flood; Tall ships advance afar; their canvas sails In their swoll'n bosom gather all the gales; Floating along the sable back of sea, Before the wind they cut their spumy way; Bend in their course, majestically slow, And to the land their lazy journey plow. Thus spungy clouds on heav'n's blue vault arise, And float, before the wind, along the skies; Their wings opposed to the illustrious sun, Shine, as they move, majestically on. Thus godlike Harold brought his floating aid, Unknowing Sueno's numbered with the dead. From Anglia's coasts he called his troops afar, To aid his brother in the foreign war. Arrived, he in the wave the anchor throws, Attempts to land, and Albion's chiefs oppose; Wave on the fatal shore the pointed spear, And send the arrow whizzing through the air. The Danes return the flying death afar, And, as they crowd away, maintain the war. An arrow tore through air its murm'ring path, Fell on the king, and weighed him down to death: Quick, from the wound, the blood tumult'ous sprung, And o'er the sand the reeking weapon flung: Prone on the strand an awful trunk he lies, While sleep eternal steals upon his eyes. The mournful chiefs around the dying stood, Some raise the body, others stem the blood: In vain their care;—the soul for ever fled, And fate had numbered Indulph with the dead. Culena, whom young Duffus set apart, With a green bank secured the hostile dart. Her father's fate assailed her tender ear, She beat her snowy breast, and tore her hair: Frantic along the sand she run, she flew, And on the corse distressful beauty threw: She called her father's shade with filial cries, And all the daughter streaming from her eyes. Bent on revenge the furious Duffus strode, And eyed, with angry look, the sable flood. A ship, which near had took its nodding stand, Fixed with the pitchy haulser to the strand, Remains of Sueno's fleet, the hero viewed, And to the mournful warriors spoke aloud: “Let those whose actions are enchained by years Honour the mighty dead with friendly tears; While we of youth, descending to the main, Exact severe atonement of the Dane.” He thus: and rushing through the billowy roars, With brawny arms his rapid journey oars; Divides with rolling chest the ridgy sea, Lashing the bubbling liquid in his way. The boat he seized, and, meas'ring back the deep, Wafted his brave companions to the ship; The haulser broke, unfurled the swelling sail, And caught the vig'rous spirit of the gale: Before the sable prow the ocean parts, And groans beneath the vessel as it darts. Now on the foe the Scottish warriors gain; Swells on the approaching eye the floating Dane. Fierce Ulric's skill brought up the lazy rear, Famed in the fields of main to urge the war. Twice seven years, in base pursuit of gain, He plowed the waves, the common foe of men; At last to Harold aiding arms he joined; Grasping the spoil with avaricious mind. At first he shoots the leaping shaft afar, And manages with skill the distant war. The chiefs of Albion, with collected might, Bear on the foe, and close the naval fight. Deck joined to deck, and man engaged with man, Sword spoke with sword, and Scot transfixed his Dane. The smoking oak is covered o'er with gore, Till the whole pirate crew are now no more. The empty hull from wave to wave is tossed, Nods as it floats, the sport of every blast. The Caledonian chiefs again pursue: The Scandinavian fleet o'er ocean flew. T' elude the foe the Danes fly diff'rent ways; And cut with sep'rate prows the hoary seas. Some bear to sea, some rush upon the land, And fly amain on earth, a trembling band. As, in pursuit of doves, on rapid wings The darting hawk through air his journey sings; But when the parting flock divides the sky, Hovers, in doubt this way or that to fly,— So undetermined long young Duffus stood; At length he sighed, and thus began aloud: “While thus, O chiefs, we urge the flying Dane, Unmourned, unhonoured lies the mighty slain; 'Tis ours to grace with woe great Indulph's bier, And o'er his fallen virtue shed the tear.” The warrior spoke: the Caledonians sighed, And with returning prow the waves divide; With swelling sail bring on the fatal shore, Where o'er the dead the aged chiefs deplore. The warriors bear their monarch as they come, In sad procession to the silent tomb, Forsake with lazy steps the sounding main, And move a sad and lamentable train. Behind the dead the tuneful bards appear, And mingle with their elegies the tear; From their sad hearts the mournful numbers flow In all the tuneful melody of woe. In grief's solemnity Culena leads A mournful train of tear-distilling maids: Above the rest the beauteous queen appears, And heightens all her beauties with her tears. Now in the tomb the godlike Indulph laid, Shared the dark couch with the illustrious dead: All o'er his grave the mournful warriors sigh, And give his dust the tribute of the eye. Removing, as the night inwrapt the sky, They share the nuptial feast with solemn joy. The royal Duffus, with a husband's care, Soothed in his martial arms the sorrowing fair, O'er Albion's rocks exerted his command, And stretched his sceptre o'er a willing land. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. ON THE DEATH OF MARSHAL KEITH. Keith then is fallen! What numbers can there flow, What strains adequate to so great a woe! Ev'n hostile kingdoms in dark pomp appear, To strew promiscuous honours o'er his bier. Hungaria gives the tribute of the eye, And ruthless Russia melts into a sigh: They mourn his fate, who felt his sword before; And all the hero in the foe deplore. What must they feel for whom the warrior stormed, Whose fields he fought, whose every counsel formed! Brave Prussia's sons depend the mournful head, And with their tears bedew the mighty dead: Sad round the corse, a stately ring they stand, Their arms reflecting terror o'er the land; With silent eyes they run the hero o'er, And mourn the chief they shall obey no more; A pearly drop hangs in each warrior's eye, And through the army runs the gen'ral sigh. Great Fred'ric comes to join the mighty woe; Eternal laurels bind his awful brow; Majestic in his arms he stands, and cries, Is Keith no more? and as he speaks, he sighs; In silence falls the sable show'r of woe; He eyes the corse, and frowns upon the foe: Then grasping his tried sword, the chief alarms, And kindles all his warriors into arms. Revenge, he cries, revenge the blood of Keith; Let Austria pay a forfeit for his death. They join, and move the shining columns on; Germania trembles to Vienna's throne. But Caledonia o'er the rest appears, And claims pre-eminence to mother-tears: In deeper gloom her tow'ring rocks arise, And from her vallies issue doleful sighs. Sadly she sits, and mourns her glory gone; He's fallen, her bravest, and her greatest son! While at her side her children all deplore The godlike hero they exiled before. Sad from his native home the chief withdrew; But kindled Scotia's glory as he flew; On far Iberia built his country's fame, And distant Russia heard the Scottish name. Turks stood aghast, as, o'er the fields of war, He ruled the storm, and urged the martial car. They asked their chiefs, what state the hero raised; And Albion on the Hellespont was praised. But chief, as relics of a dying race, The Keiths command, in woe, the foremost place; A name for ages through the world revered, By Scotia loved, by all her en'mies feared; Now falling, dying, lost to all but fame, And only living in the hero's name. See! the proud halls they once possessed, decayed, The spiral tow'rs depend the lofty head; Wild ivy creeps along the mould'ring walls, And with each gust of wind a fragment falls; While birds obscene at noon of night deplore, Where mighty heroes kept the watch before. On Mem'ry's tablet mankind soon decay, On Time's swift stream their glory slides away; But, present in the voice of deathless Fame, Keith lives, eternal, in his glorious name: While ages far remote his actions show; And mark with them the way their chiefs should go; While sires unto their wond'ring offspring tell, Keith lived in glory, and in glory fell. ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY. Lamented shade! thy fate demands a tear, An offering due to thy untimely bier; Accept then, early tenant of the skies, The genuine drops that flow from friendship's eyes! Those eyes which raptured hung on thee before, Those eyes which never shall behold thee more: So early hast thou to the tomb retired, And left us mourning what we once admired. For this did beauty's fairest hand arise On all your shape, and kindle in your eyes? For this did virtue form your infant mind, And make thee best, as fairest of thy kind? Did all the powers for this their gifts bestow, And only charm us to increase our woe? A moment bless us with celestial day, Then envious snatch the sacred beam away? Recall the beauteous prize they lately gave, And bid our tears descend on Anna's grave? How did the mother see her daughter rise, A lovely plant to bless her aged eyes! How oft in thought her future pleasure trace, Appoint her husband, and enjoy her race! But now no husband shall enjoy that bloom, Nor offspring rise from the unfruitful tomb. An unexpected gift the virgin came, The last, but fairest, of a falling name; A ray to light a father's eve she shone, And healed the loss of many a buried son: But soon invading darkness chased away The beauteous setting of a glorious day; Soon Heaven, which gave, again resumed its own; And of his family he remains alone. His thoughts in her refined no more he'll trace, Or view his features softened in her face; No more in secret on her beauty gaze, Or hide his gladness when he hears her praise: Mute is the tongue which pleased his soul before, And beauty blushes in that cheek no more. Peace, gentle shade, attend thy balmy rest, And earth sit lightly on thy snowy breast; Let guardian angels gently hover round, And downy silence haunt the hallowed ground: There let the Spring its sweetest offspring rear, And sad Aurora shed her earliest tear. Some future maid perhaps, as she goes by, Shall view the place where her cold reliques lie: Folly for once may sadden into care, And pride, unconscious, shed one generous tear; While this big truth is swelling in the breast, That death nor spares the fairest nor the best; That virtue feels the unalterable doom, And beauty's self must moulder in the tomb. TO THE MEMORY OF AN OFFICER KILLED BEFORE QUEBEC. Ah me! what sorrow are we born to bear! How many causes claim the falling tear! In one sad tenor life's dark current flows, And every moment has its load of woes: In vain we toil for visionary ease, Or hope for blessings in the vale of peace: Coy happiness ne'er blesses human eyes, Or but appears a moment, and she flies. When peace itself can seldom dry the tear, What floods demand the dreary wastes of war! Where undistinguished ruin reigns o'er all, At once the truant and the valiant fall; Where timeless shrouds inwrap the great and brave, And Daphnis sinks into a nameless grave. Dear hapless youth, cut off in early bloom, A fair, but mangled victim to the tomb! No friendly hand to grace thy fall was near, No parent's eye to shed one pious tear; No favoured maid to close thy languid eyes, And send thee mindful of her to the skies: On some cold bank thy decent limbs were laid; Oh! honoured living, but neglected dead! So soon forsake us, dear lamented shade, To mix obscurely with the nameless dead! Thus baulk the rising glory of thy name, And leave unfinished an increasing fame! Thus sink for ever from a parent's eyes! Wert thou not cruel? or ye partial, skies? But what can bound, O thou by all approved! The sad, sad sorrows of the friend you loved? A friend who doted on thy worth before! A friend who never shall behold thee more! Who saw, combined, thy manly graces rise, To please the mind and bless the ravished eyes; A soul replete with all that's great and fair, A form which cruel savages might spare. If, in the midnight hour, lamented shade, You view the place where thy remains are laid; If pale you hover o'er your secret grave, Or viewless flit o'er Hoshelega's wave; O! when my troubled soul is sunk in rest, And peaceful slumbers sooth my anxious breast, To fancy's eyes in all thy bloom appear, Once more thy own unsullied image wear; Unfold the secrets of your world to me, Tell what thou art, and what I soon shall be. He comes! he comes! but O how changed of late! How much deforms the leaden hand of fate! Why do I see that generous bosom gored? Why bathed in blood the visionary sword? What rudeness ruffled that disordered hair? Why, blameless shade, that mournful aspect wear? For sure such virtues must rewarded be, And Heaven itself approve of Wolfe and thee. Yes, thou art blessed above the rolling sphere; 'Tis for myself, not thee, I shed the tear. Where shall I now such blameless friendship find, Thou last best comfort of a drooping mind? To whom the pressures of my soul impart, Transfer my sorrows, and divide my heart? Remote is he who ruled my breast before, And he shall sooth me into peace no more. Men born to grief, an unrelenting kind, Of breasts discordant, and of various mind, Scarce, 'midst of thousands, find a single friend; If Heaven at length the precious blessing send, A sudden death recalls him from below; A moment's bliss is paid with years of woe. What boots the rising sigh? in vain we weep, We, too, like him, anon must fall asleep; Life, and its sorrows too, shall soon be o'er, And the heart heave with bursting sighs no more; Death shed oblivious rest on every head, And one dull silence reign o'er all the dead. THE EARL MARISCHAL'S WELCOME TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY. An Ode, attempted in the manner of Pindar. 'Twas when the full-eared harvest bow'd Beneath the merry reaper's hand; When here the plenteous sheafs were strew'd, And there the corns nod o'er the land; When on each side the loaden'd ground, Breathing her ripen'd scents, the jovial season crown'd; The villagers, all on the green, The arrival of their lord attend: The blythsome shepherds haste to join, And whistling from the hills descend; Nor orphan nor lone widow mourns; Even hopeless lovers lose their pains; To-day their banish'd lord returns, Once more to bless his native plains. Each hoary sire, with gladden'd face, Repeats some ancient tale, How he with Tyrcis, at the chace, Hied o'er the hill and dale: Their hoary heads with rapture glow, While each to each repeats, How well he knew where to bestow, Was to oppression still a foe; Still mixing with their praise his youthful feats. Then from the grass Melanthus rose, The arbitrator of the plains, And silent all stood fixed to hear The Tityrus of Mernia's swains; For with the Muse's fire his bosom glow'd, And easy from his lips the numbers flow'd. “Now the wished-for day is come, Our lord reviews his native home; Now clear and strong ideas rise, And wrap my soul in extasies: Methinks I see that ruddy morn, When, waken'd by the hunter's horn, I rose, and, by yon mountain's side, Saw Tyrcis and Achates ride; While, floating by yon craggy brow, The slowly-scattering mist withdrew; I saw the roe-buck cross yon plain, Yon heathy steep I saw him gain; The hunters still fly o'er the ground, Their shouts the distant hills resound; Dunnotyr's towers resound the peal That echoes o'er the hill and dale. At length, what time the ploughman leads Home from the field his weary steeds, At yon old tree the roe-buck fell: The huntsmen's jocund mingled shouts his downfall tell. “The mem'ry of these happy days Still in my breast must transport raise; Those happy days, when oft were seen The brothers marching o'er the green, With dog and gun, while yet the night Was blended with the dawning light, When first the sheep begin to bleat, And the early kine rise from their dewy seat.” Thus as he spoke, each youthful breast Glows with wild extasies; In each eye rapture stands confest, Each thinks he flies along the mead, And manages the fiery steed, And hears the beagles' cries. The sage Melanthus now again Stretch'd forth his hand, and thus resum'd the strain: “Now my youthful heat returns, My breast with youthful vigour burns: Methinks I see that glorious day, When, to hunt the fallow-deer, Three thousand march'd in grand array: Three thousand march'd with bow and spear,— All in the light and healthy dress Our brave forefathers wore, In Kenneth's wars, and Bruce's days, And when the Romans fled their dreadful wrath of yore. O'er every hill, o'er every dale, All by the winding banks of Tay, Resounds the hunter's chearful peal, Their armour glittering to the day.” Big with his joys of youth the old man stood; Dunnotyr's ruin'd towers then caught his eye; He stopp'd, and hung his head in pensive mood, And from his bosom burst the unbidden sigh. Then turning, with a warrior look, Shaking his hoary curls, the old man spoke: “Virtue, O Fortune! scorns thy power, Thou can'st not bind her for an hour; Virtue shall ever shine; And endless praise, her glorious dower, Shall bless her sons divine. The kings of th' earth, with open arms, The illustrious exiles hail: See warlike Cyrus, great and wise, Demand, and follow their advice, And all his breast unveil. “See, pouring from their hills of snow, Nations of savages in arms! A desert lies where'er they go, Before them march pale Terror and Alarms. The Princes of the South prepare Their thousand thousands for the war; Against thee, Cyrus, they combine; The North and South their forces join, To crush thee in the dust: But thou art safe; Achates draws His sword with thine, and backs thy cause; Yes, thou art doubly safe, thy cause is just. “With dread the Turks have oft beheld His sword wide waving o'er the field; As oft these sons of carnage fled O'er mountains of their kindred dead. “When all the fury of the fight With wrath redoubled rag'd; When man to man, with giant-might, For all that's dear engag'd; When all was thunder, smoke, and fire; When from their native rocks the frighted springs retire; 'Twas then, through streams of smoke and blood, Achates mounts the city-wall: Though wounded, like a god he stood, And at his feet the foes submissive fall. “Brave are the Goths, and fierce in fight, Yet these he gave to rout and flight; Proud when they were of victory, He rushed on like a storm; dispersed and weak they fly. Thus, from the Grampians old, A torrent, deep and strong, Down rushes on the fold, And sweeps the shepherd and the flock along. “When, through an aged wood, The thunder roars amain, His paths with oaks are strewed, And ruin marks the plain: So many a German field can tell, How in his path the mighty heroes fell. “When, with their numerous dogs, the swains Surprise the aged lion's den, The old warrior rushes to the charge, And scorns the rage of dogs and men; His whelps he guards on every side; Safe they retreat. What though a mortal dart Stands trembling in his breast, his dauntless heart Glows with a victor's pride. “So the old lion, brave Achates, fought, And miracles of prowess wrought; With a few piquets bore the force Of eighty thousand, stopped their course, Till off his friends had marched, and all was well. Even he himself could ne'er do more, Fate had no greater deed in store— When all his host was safe, the godlike hero fell.” Thus as he spoke, each hoary sire Fights o'er again his ancient wars; Each youth burns with a hero's fire, And triumphs in his future scars; O'er bloody fields each thinks he rides, The thunder of the battle guides (Beneath his lifted arm, struck pale, The foes for mercy cry); And hears applauding legions hail Him with the shouts of victory. HORACE, Ode xvi. Book 2. imitated. The weary sailor calls for ease, When winds turmoil the angry seas, And not a moon or star to guide His dreary course along the tide; When half the sky in showers descends, And wind the gilded streamer rends; Blessed he, within the hut, he cries, Now bends in rest his peaceful eyes; Or hears the tempest idly rave; No av'rice tempts him to the wave. Turn to the noisy camp your eye, There care corrodes, and starts the sigh. Shew me the man among them all, Who drove o'er Minden's plains the Gaul; When Broglio's ranks at distance rise, And cannon murmur through the skies; But would forego the breath of fame, And live at ease without a name. 'Tis not the sash, the gown, the robe, These gilded baits that catch the mob; Or tides of flatt'rers at the door, Can paint with bliss the passing hour; Or half the cares within controul, And calm the tumults of the soul. Nor can the dome or lofty wall, Or guards that crowd the tyrant's hall, With all their instruments of wars, Exclude the dark, invading cares: Around the bed of state they fly, And dash the guilty cup of joy. More happy he! whose guiltless mind Is to his native fields confined; Blessed with his state; and craves no more Than heaven allowed his sires before: Who sees his frugal table spread, Beneath the roof his fathers made; No care, by day, disturbs his breast, He sleeps, by night, his brows in rest. Whence all these schemes, this wild uproar, Since life itself shall soon be o'er? Why do we, with advent'rous eyes, See other suns in other skies? Or pant where Indian billows roll? Or freeze beneath the arctic pole? In vain we fly destructive Care, The monster in our breasts we bear. Go, then; forsake your calm retreat, Cringe at the portals of the great; Attend the gaudy venal train, Throw virtue off, to raise your gain; Or spread your canvas to the gale; Or court the muses in the vale; If still in sorrow you repine, Fly for relief to whores and wine. In vain you fly from inbred woe: Care climbs the vessel's painted prow: Care haunts the palace of the great, And hovers round the dark retreat: Care clouds the fair one's lovely face, And floats within the sparkling glass. Even round the sprightly muse it flies, And taints the numbers as they rise. If life you want undashed with woe, Serene enjoy the instant now; Nor ills you left behind deplore, Nor eye the giant grief before; If Fortune shines, enjoy the ray, And smile her very gloom away: Let tempests sweep and billows roar, The storm of life shall soon be o'er. Some perish in their youthful bloom; With age some wither to the tomb; Heaven, as a curse, to some supplies The years to others it denies; What can the longest liver do, But see a greater train of woe? Be yours in public life to shine, With all the glory of your line; To rule the battle's noisy tide, Or Britain's great concerns to guide; Teach virtue to a venal throng, While senates listen to your tongue, To me my fortune more severe, Has only given a mind sincere; A spark of genius to pass o'er The tedious dulness of the hour; A soul that can a knave despise, And eye the great with careless eyes. HORACE, Ode x. Book 2. imitated. TO A FRIEND. When tempests sweep and billows roll, And winds contend along the pole; When o'er the deck ascends the sea, And half the sheet is torn away; Shew me the man among the crew, Who would not change his place with you; Prefer the quiet of the plain To all the riches of the main. Thrice happy he! and he alone, Who makes the golden mean his own; Whose life is neither ebb nor flow, Nor rises high nor sinks too low: He prides not in the envied wall, Nor pines in Want's deserted hall; His careless eyes with ease behold The star, the string, and hoarded gold. Unlike the venal sons of power; They rise, but rise to fall the more. When faction rends the public air, And Pitt shall tumble from his sphere, In privacy secluded, you Scarce feel which way the tempest blew. Storms rend the lofty tower in twain, And bow the poplar to the plain; The hills are wrapt in clouds on high, And feel th' artillery of the sky; When not a breath the valley wakes, Or curls the surface of the lakes. When storms on Fortune's ocean lowr, And rolling billows lash the shore; When loved allies return to clay, And paltry riches wing their way; The faithless mobs, the perjured whore, That hovered round thy pelf before, Fall gradual down the ebbing tide; Thy dog, the last, forsakes thy side: Retire within; enjoy thy mind; There, what they all denied thee, find. When Fortune threats to fly, be gay, And puff the fickle thing away. Nor still it lowrs; the tempest flies, The golden sun descends the skies; The gale is living in the grass, In gentler surges roll the seas. But wisely thou contract the sail, And catch but half the breathing gale; Be cautious still of Fortune's wiles, Avoid the siren when she smiles; With prudence laugh her gloom away, And trust her least when she looks gay. THE CHOICE. Did Fortune, what to few she'll give, Allow me make my choice to live; I would not seek an envied seat, Or daily visits of the great; Nor yet would my ambition fall To meagre Want's deserted hall; To each extreme alike a foe, Too low for high, too high for low. For use, not shew, my house would stand Amid a spot of fertile land; A lake below; around a wood; Here bend a rock; there rush a flood. A mountain would in prospect rise, And bear the grey mist to the skies. When in some dark retreat I sit, Be near a friend, a man of wit, Of heart sincere, and converse free, The lover of mankind and me; Who, should the world tumultuous roar, Could calmly see the storm ashore, Nor e'er admit a longing sigh To vex my privacy and I. Here would I pass my blameless days, Beloved of virtue, and of ease; Here die in peace, and lie unknown Without a monument or stone. My friend might shed one pious tear; My image in his bosom bear; Might breathe, in verse, his tender moan, But breathe unto himself alone; I envy to the world my name, And puff away the strumpet Fame. WRITTEN ON A BIRTH DAY. Alas the years! how swift they roll, How swift they fly to Death's dark goal! And let them roll, and let them fly, I die but once—and let me die. Arrived at last at twenty-two, What honours rise upon my brow? What have I done to raise my name, And send to future times my fame? No matter what—for this consoles, That fame is but the breath of fools. And what, alas! a name can do, When I am cold, when I am low? Shall I come back to hear my lays Excite the critic's after-praise? Behold me quoted in reviews, Or posted up to fame in news? Let Fame deny or grant the bays, No censure I shall feel, nor praise. Why should I then destroy my peace, Or purchase fame with loss of ease? But still the soft Aönian maid Invites me, smiling, to the shade: “One song ere you lay by the lyre, “Myself my poet will inspire.” Away!—I own your power no more, Away!—thou prostituted whore. Your charming simpers, artful smiles, Persuasive voice, and little wiles, No more shall cause me hunt for fame, Or seek that empty shade—a name. THE MONUMENT. In vain we toil for lasting fame, Or give to other times our name; The bust itself shall soon be gone, The figure moulder from the stone; The plaintive strain, the moving lay, Like those they mourn, at last decay: My name a surer way shall live, A surer way, my fair can give: In her dear mem'ry let me live alone; When Nisa dies, I wish not to be known. VERSES SENT TO A YOUNG LADY, WITH SOME TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ERSE. Behold, fair maid, what Nature could inspire, When Albion's lovely dames confessed their fire; When love was stranger to the guise of art, And virgins spoke the language of the heart; When sweet simplicity, with charms displayed, Confirmed the bands which beauty first had made. On rocks they lived among the savage kind, But little of the rock was in their mind; They felt the call of nature in their heart, And Pity wept when Beauty shot the dart: Each maid, with sorrow, saw her conquests rise, And drowned with tears the lightning of her eyes. When the loved youth appeared with manly charms, And called the blooming beauty to his arms; To meet his generous flame the maid would fly, Nor did the tongue, what eyes confessed, deny. No toils could her from his dear side remove; She shared his dangers, as she shared his love. With him against the chace she bent the bow; In fields of death with him she met the foe; If pierced with wounds, a mournful sight he lay, With tears she washed the gory tide away; And decent in the tomb her hero laid, And as she blessed him living, mourned him dead. In thee, blest nymph, indulgent Nature joined The face of beauty with the tender mind; In thee the present virtues we behold, With all the charms of Albion's dames of old: But be their sorrow to themselves alone, As thine their beauty, be their woes their own. Too oft, in times of old, did war's alarms Tear lovely Youth from Beauty's folding arms! Too oft the early tears of spouses flow, And blooming widows beat their breasts of snow. But when the happy youth of form divine, At once the fav'rite of the world and thine, Enjoys unrivalled all that heaven of charms, Death, late descend!—Avoid him, hostile arms! Let growing pleasures crown each rising year, Still be that cheek unsullied with a tear; That heart no pang but of affection know; That ear be stranger to the voice of woe. When Time itself shall bid that beauty fly, And lightning arm no more that lovely eye; May the bright legacy successive fall, And thy loved sons and daughters share it all; Thy sons be every virgin's secret care, Thy lovely daughters like the mother fair; The first in prudence emulate their sire; The last, like thee, set all the world on fire. THE CAVE. WRITTEN IN THE HIGHLANDS. The wind is up, the field is bare; Some hermit lead me to his cell, Where Contemplation, lonely fair, With blessed Content has chose to dwell. Behold! it opens to my sight, Dark in the rock; beside the flood; Dry fern around obstructs the light; The winds above it move the wood. Reflected in the lake I see The downward mountains and the skies, The flying bird, the waving tree, The goats that on the hills arise. The grey-cloaked herd drives on the cow; The slow-paced fowler walks the heath; A freckled pointer scours the brow; A musing shepherd stands beneath. Curve o'er the ruin of an oak, The woodman lifts his axe on high, The hills re-echo to the stroke; I see, I see the shivers fly. Some rural maid, with apron full, Brings fuel to the homely flame; I see the smoky columns roll, And through the chinky hut the beam. Beside a stone o'ergrown with moss, Two well-met hunters talk at ease; Three panting dogs beside repose; One bleeding deer is stretched on grass. A lake, at distance, spreads to sight, Skirted with shady forests round, In midst an island's rocky height Sustains a ruin once renowned. One tree bends o'er the naked walls, Two broad-winged eagles hover nigh, By intervals a fragment falls, As blows the blast along the sky. Two rough-spun hinds the pinnace guide, With lab'ring oars, along the flood; An angler, bending o'er the tide, Hangs from the boat th' insidious wood. Beside the flood, beneath the rocks, On grassy bank two lovers lean; Bend on each other amorous looks, And seem to laugh and kiss between. The wind is rustling in the oak; They seem to hear the tread of feet; They start, they rise, look round the rock; Again they smile, again they meet. But see! the grey mist from the lake Ascends upon the shady hills; Dark storms the murmuring forests shake, Rain beats,—resound a hundred rills. To Damon's homely hut I fly; I see it smoking o'er the plain: When storms are past,—and fair the sky, I'll often seek my cave again. FRAGMENTS FROM TYRTÆUS. FRAGMENT I. I call the man unworthy of my praise, Who wins the palm in wrestling or the race; Should he excel in bulk and strength mankind, Or in the course outstrip the Thracian wind; Though Nature gave him Tithon's form divine, And Asia poured him wealth from every mine; Though Pelops' wide domains to him belong, And more, Adrastus' eloquence of tongue; Though fortune every other virtue gave, And yet deny the greatest—to be brave. And brave alone is he, who can sustain The wild confusion of the bloody plain; Can death and wounds behold with dire delight, And shady legions moving to the fight. For he alone a lasting name can raise, And crown his early years with martial praise, Who in the front of battle stands unmoved, The bulwark of the country which he loved; And loving, prodigal of life, to die, Avoids no evil more than basely fly. His great example shall the host inspire, And thousands follow actions they admire. He turns the phalanx of the foe to flight, And rules, with martial art, the tide of fight: And when he falls amid the field of fame, He leaves behind a great and lasting name; His sire, his country, shall with joy surround His corse, and read their glory in his wound. Both young and old shall sing his dirge of woe; And his long fun'ral all the town pursue: His tomb shall be revered: his children shine Through every age, a long-extended line. Ne'er shall his glory fade, or cease his fame; Though laid in dust, immortal is his name, Who never from the field of battle flies, But for his children and his country dies. But if the sable hand of death he shun, Returning victor, with his glory won; By young and old revered, his life he'll lead, And full of honour sink among the dead: Or with his growing years his fame shall grow, And all shall reverence his head of snow. The higher place from every youth he bears, And age shall quit him all the claim of years. Who then desires to rise to such a height, Desires in vain, if he forget the fight. FRAGMENT II. Ye, then, who boast Alcides' race divine, Be strong; great Jove shall ne'er forsake his line. Aided by Heav'n, no human prowess fear; Exalt the shady buckler to the war. But, bent on fate, what danger need you fly, Or shun a death so grateful to the sky? Ye knew the horrid work of arms before, The dismal shock of battle oft ye bore; Or when you fled, or when the field you won, In each reverse to you is fortune known. For those who, in the front of battle, dare Fight hand to hand, and bear the brunt of war, But rarely fall.—Though dastards skulk behind, The fate they shun still haunts the cow'rdly kind. What mind can well conceive, or tongue relate, The ills unnamed that on the truant wait? To shun his fate when from the field he flies, Pierced from behind, th' inglorious coward dies. When prone he lies and gasping on the ground, What shame, to see behind the gaping wound! But, firm to earth, let every warrior grow, Strain his large limbs, and low'ring eye the foe; Let every shield, a mighty round, displayed, From head to foot the gathered warrior shade; Each vig'rous hand the spear portended hold, When dreadful nods above the casque of gold. To mighty deeds let each his arm extend, Nor dread the darts his buckler may defend. To distance let him not project the spear, But manage hand to hand the work of war; Shield closed to shield, advance th' imbattled line, Crest reach to crest, and casque to helmet join; When, breast to breast, are stretched the ranks of war, Hew them with swords, or break them with the spear. Ye, whom no heavy panoplies inclose, Discharge, at distance, stones against the foes, And hurl with martial force the missive spear; But near the phalanx, shun the closer war. FRAGMENT III. How graceful lies the brave man on the plain, Covered with wounds, and for his country slain! But ah! expelled from home, how mean! how low! Through foreign realms to lead a life of woe! Strolling with parents sunk in wieldless years, A helpless wife, and infants drowned in tears! Condemned to want and shame, him all shall hate, And drive the wand'rer from the closing gate. His form he shall disgrace, his race, his blood, By ills unnamed and infamy pursued. Nor only is the dastard lost to fame, But, what is worse, to all the sense of shame. But let us fight for Sparta while we may, Nor spare a life which soon must pass away. Collect your bands, ye warriors, closely fight; Forget your fear; forget inglorious flight. Let glory every martial bosom fill, Nor value life when foes remain to kill. Leave not the hoary vet'rans numbed with age, Where burns the combat, and the thickest rage: What shame! an aged warrior prone should lie, Transfixed with wounds, when younger men are by; His beard transformed, his wrinkled temples gray, And breathe, in dust, his dauntless soul away? Who can his hands behold, with shameless eyes, Cov'ring his naked carcase as he lies, Decent in death?—But all things youth become, Whom nature covers with her fairest bloom; Graceful, in life, to men and women's eyes; Graceful, in death, when on the field he lies. Then, once engaged, let every warrior grow Firm to the earth, and low'r upon the foe. ANACREON, ODE IV. TRANSLATED. On beds of tender myrtles laid, Or melelot, supinely spread, I'll quaff the bowl; and, neatly dressed, Young Cupid shall direct the feast. Come! fill the bumper to the brim, And heave away this load of time. This little wheel of vital day Shall shortly roll itself away; And when we to the dust return, How small our portion in the urn! Why should you then anoint my stone? Or earth with rich libations drown? No: rather let my sleeky hair The fragrant oil and chaplet wear, While yet I live; with all her charms Call too my fair-one to my arms; And Love, before from hence I go, To mingle with the shades below; Here let me dissipate my care, And leave my grief in upper air. ANACREON, ODE VIII. By night, on purple carpets spread, When Bacchus hovered in my head; In dreams I seemed to stretch the race With virgins of the fairest face; While taunting youths at distance stood, As fair as of immortal blood; And ridiculed me for the fair, But seemed to wish themselves were there. Unheeding I pursue my bliss, And try to snatch one balmy kiss, When, all at once, the vision fled, And left me hapless on the bed: The promised bliss hung in my brain; I turned, and wished to sleep again. IN ANSWER TO A LETTER FROM DELIA. Twice has the winter vexed the main, And twice the summer parched the plain, Since, absent from his Delia's eyes, Remote the hapless poet sighs, And sees the joyless seasons roll, Far from the charmer of his soul. In vain, to shroud thee from my eyes, Or billows roll, or mountains rise, When diving in the secret shade, I see, in thought, my charming maid In all the light of beauty move, As when she warmed my heart to love: Again her charms my soul surprise, I feel the lightning of her eyes; Her marble neck, her hair behold Like winding tides of melted gold; Still on her cheek the roses glow, Still swells her breast of heaving snow. The vision flies, delusive all! From what a height poor mortals fall! I wake to care—My fair no more I see;—The winds around me roar; Cold showers from sullen skies descend, And storms the lofty forest rend; I fly the tempest—leave the plain, But oh! from love I fly in vain. In crowds would I dissolve my care, The peace I seek, I find not there. My absent fair one prompts my sighs, And calls the tears from both my eyes; My heart beats thick against my side, More swiftly rolls the crimson tide; I sweat, I pant, my ears resound, And vision dimly swims around. I pine, I languish in my pain, And scarce does half the man remain. I eye the maids, the soft and gay, And wish to look my soul away; With other objects to supply The fair, the adverse fates deny; Ill were my fair by them supplied,— Their form disgusts, but more their pride. With haughty sneer they seem to say, Away, dull impudence! away! You look, you sigh, and weep in vain; Go; woo some trull upon the plain. With conscious shame I blush, I glow; My Delia would not use me so— A packet!—'tis my Delia's hand— What would my lovely maid command? Am I my fair-one's tender care? Love me!—What would you love, my dear? No fair domains of mine are spread, No lofty villa rears its head; No lowing herds are heard afar, Nor neighs the courser at my car; No pageantry of state is mine, I boast no nobles in my line; My numbers are admired by none, Or by the partial maid alone; No beauties on my limbs arise, Nor armed with lightning are my eyes: Love me! what would you love, my dear? A gen'rous heart—a mind sincere; A soul that fortune's frowns defies, Nor flatters fools I must despise, Is all I boast, my charming fair! Love me!—what would you love, my dear! A NIGHT-PIECE. 'Tis night: and storms the forest shake; Dark roll the billows on the lake; The whirlwind sweeps; descends the rain, The torrents echo to the plain: Through desert paths forlorn I stray, And not a moon to light my way; No friendly star with golden eye Looks from the cieling of the sky. Here sounds an oak;—there spreads a plane; Above, the rock defends the rain; The murm'ring rill o'er pebbles flies, The wind along the bramble sighs: A fox is howling on the rock, A screech-owl on a blasted oak: The passing meteor lights the vale; A spirit whispers on the gale, Or beck'ning longs to breathe its care; And ghastly horror rides the air. A ruin! 'Twas of old the seat Of heroes now resigned to fate; Where often mirth relaxed the soul, And midnight crowned the rosy bowl; Where sprightly music swelled the sound, While blooming beauty tript around. They vanished, as they ne'er had been, No lyre is heard, no maid is seen, No more the tuneful lyrist warms, Death long since rifled beauty's charms; No warrior's martial size is shown, Time moulders down the very stone; With every blast the fragments fall, And winds are blust'ring in the hall. Unhappy man! how short his date, He springs to light, and sinks in fate; Ev'n from the womb, the tomb is seen; And sorrow fills the space between. Bid paltry riches glut his eye, Or empty glory raise him high; Bid him in wrangling senates glow, Or turn the batt'ry on the foe; Yet, high or low, 'tis mankind's lot, To live in grief, and die forgot. Go, on the stone inscribe thy name, And to the marble trust thy fame; Bid half the mountain form thy tomb, The wonder of the times to come; The mound shall sink, the stone decay, The sculptured figure wear away; The bust that proudly speaks thy praise, Some shepherd's future cot may raise; While, smiling round, his infant son Admires the figures on the stone. A tomb its dreary honour shows! Three stones exalt their heads of moss; A bust, half-sunk in earth, appears, The rude remains of former years; Dry tufts of grass around it rise, The wind along the brushwood sighs, Now peeping from the cloudy pole, The moon has silvered o'er the whole. Here, hoar tradition tells, repose Two youths the dread of Albion's foes, Of other times the grace and pride, Who saved their country when they died; But rolling time has lost their name, So faithless is the breath of fame. That light! it issues from the cot, Be grief suspended,—care forgot: There Nisa for her lover sighs, And rolls on night her wishful eyes: Why has my ling'ring rover stayed? I come, I come, my lovely maid, To feast my eyes on all your charms, And lose my sorrow in your arms. VERSES TO A YOUNG LADY. When half the nation round Almira sighs, And sense secures the conquest of her eyes, Why bids the nymph a muse unknown to fame To grace her numbers with so fair a name? Or would the maid add lustre to my lays? Or shew the world how weakly I can praise? The muse disclaimed, and all the powers of song, The rapture vanished, and the lyre unstrung; I left to other bards their groves of bays, And sacrificed my hopes of fame to ease. Nor Delia's charms could bid my numbers rise, Nor caught my soul the fire of Chloe's eyes; On Mira's cheek in vain did roses glow, And Chloris heaved, unsung, her breast of snow; Almira only could my breast inflame, Were but my strength proportioned to my theme. Grant then I sung, what honour could I pay, Where every grace displayed prevents the lay? Thee first in beauty, sighing thousands own; And thou art stranger to thy worth alone: Charms after charms in fair succession rise, Thy wit pursues the progress of thine eyes; Each love-sick youth, without the poet's art, Beholds enough to rob him of his heart; The muse despairs to make thee brighter shine, Or give one beauty not already thine. Permit me then, since useless are my lays, To give my adoration for my praise; With other youths, the pleasing pain to prove; Though hope, alas! can never lodge with love: Let me admire the charms I'll ne'er possess; And eye, in rapture, what I can't express. FRAGMENT OF A NORTHERN TALE. Where Harold, with golden hair, spread o'er Lochlin Where Harold, with golden hair, spread o'er Lochlin his high commands; where, with justice, he ruled the tribes, who sunk, subdued, beneath his sword; abrupt rises Gormal in snow! The tempests roll dark on his sides, but calm, above, his vast forehead appears. White-issuing from the skirt of his storms, the troubled torrents pour down his sides. Joining, as they roar along, they bear the Torno, in foam, to the main. Grey on the bank and far from men, half-covered by ancient pines from the wind, a lonely pile exalts its head, long-shaken by the storms of the north. To this fled Sigurd, fierce in fight, from Harold the leader of armies, when fate had brightened his spear with renown: When he conquered in that rude field, where Lulan's warriors fell in blood, or rose, in terror, on the waves of the main. Darkly sat the grey-haired chief; yet sorrow dwelt not in his soul. But when the warrior thought on the past, his proud heart heaved against his side: Forth flew his sword from its place, he wounded Harold in all the winds. One daughter, and only one, but bright in form and mild of soul, the last beam of the setting line, remained to Sigurd of all his race. His son, in Lulan's battle slain, beheld not his father's flight from his foes. Nor finished seemed the ancient line! The splendid beauty of bright-eyed Fithon covered still the fallen king with renown. Her arm was white like Gormal's snow; her bosom whiter than the foam of the main, when roll the waves beneath the wrath of the winds. Like two stars were her radiant eyes, like two stars that rise on the deep, when dark tumult embroils the night. Pleasant are their beams aloft, as stately they ascend the skies. Nor Odin forgot, in aught, the maid. Her form scarce equalled her lofty mind. Awe moved around her stately steps. Heroes loved—but shrunk away in their fears. Yet midst the pride of all her charms, her heart was soft, and her soul was kind. She saw the mournful with tearful eyes. Transient darkness arose in her breast. Her joy was in the chace. Each morning, when doubtful light wandered dimly on Lulan's waves, she rouzed the resounding woods, to Gormal's head of snow. Nor moved the maid alone, &amp;c. THE SAME VERSIFIED. Where fair-haired Harold o'er Scandinia reigned, And held, with justice, what his valour gained, Sevo, in snow, his rugged forehead rears, And, o'er the warfare of his storms, appears Abrupt and vast. White-wandering down his side A thousand torrents, gleaming as they glide, Unite below; and pouring through the plain Hurry the troubled Torno to the main. Grey, on the bank, remote from human kind, By aged pines half sheltered from the wind, A homely mansion rose, of antique form, For ages battered by the polar storm. To this fierce Sigurd fled from Norway's lord, When fortune settled on the warrior's sword, In that rude field where Suecia's chiefs were slain; Or forced to wander o'er the Bothnic main. Dark was his life, yet undisturbed with woes; But when the memory of defeat arose, His proud heart struck his side; he graspt the spear, And wounded Harold in the vacant air. One daughter only, but of form divine, The last fair beam of the departing line, Remained of Sigurd's race. His warlike son Fell in the shock which overturned the throne. Nor desolate the house! Fionia's charms Sustained the glory, which they lost in arms. White was her arm, as Sevo's lofty snow, Her bosom fairer than the waves below, When heaving to the winds. Her radiant eyes Like two bright stars, exulting as they rise, O'er the dark tumult of a stormy night, And gladdening heaven, with their majestic light. In nought is Odin to the maid unkind, Her form scarce equals her exalted mind; Awe leads her sacred steps where'er they move, And mankind worship where they dare not love. But, mixed with softness, was the virgin's pride, Her heart had feelings which her eyes denied. Her bright tears started at another's woes, While transient darkness on her soul arose. The chace she loved; when morn, with doubtful beam, Came dimly wandering o'er the Bothnic stream, On Sevo's sounding sides she bent the bow, And rouzed his forests to his head of snow. Nor moved the maid alone, &amp;c. FINIS.</field>
