      <field name="fulltext">MINOR POEMS. I. EVENING SERVICE. PERFORMED BY DR. VALPY AT READING SCHOOL. There is a holy magic in that tone, Can wake from memory's selectest cell The hour when first upon my heart it fell Like dew from Heaven:—the years that since have flown Seem airy dreams;—yet not of self alone Those sacred strains are eloquent;—they tell Of numbers temper'd by their simple spell In boyhood's unreflecting prime to own Their kindred with their fellows—best of lore!— Who to this spot, as Persians to the East, Turn reverential thoughts from every shore Which holds them; nor forbear, till life has ceased, With child-like love, a blessing to implore On thee, great charity's unspotted priest! II. THE FORBURY, AT READING. VISITED ON A MISTY EVENING IN AUTUMN. Soft uplands, that in boyhood's earliest days Seem'd mountain-like and distant, fain once more Would I behold you! but the autumn hoar Hath veil'd your pensive groves in evening haze; Yet must I wait till on my searching gaze Your outline lives—more dear than if ye wore An April sunset's consecrating rays— For, even thus, the images of yore Which ye awaken glide from misty years Dream-like and solemn, and but half unfold Their tale of glorious hopes, religious fears, And visionary schemes of giant mould; Whose dimmest trace the world-worn heart reveres, And, with love's grasping weakness, strives to hold. III. ON HEARING THE SHOUTS OF THE PEOPLE AT THE READING ELECTION IN THE SUMMER OF 1826, AT A DISTANCE. Hark! from the distant town the long acclaim On the charm'd silence of the evening breaks With startling interruption;—yet it wakes Thought of that voice of never-dying fame Which on my boyish meditation came Here, at an hour like this;—my soul partakes A moment's gloom, that yon fierce contest slakes Its thirst of high emprise and glorious aim: Yet wherefore? Feelings that from heaven are shed Into our tenements of flesh, ally Themselves to earthly passions, lest, unfed By warmth of human sympathies, they die; And shall—earth's fondest aspirations dead— Fulfil their first and noblest prophecy. IV. VIEW OF THE VALLEY OF READING. FROM TILEHURST, AT THE CLOSE OF THE SAME ELECTION. Too long have I regarded thee, fair vale, But as a scene of struggle which denies All pensive joy; and now with childhood's eyes In old tranquillity, I bid thee hail; And welcome to my soul thy own sweet gale, Which wakes from loveliest woods the melodies Of long-lost fancy—Never may there fail Within thy circlet, spirits born to rise In honour—whether won by freedom rude In her old Spartan majesty, or wrought With partial, yet no base regard, to brood O'er usages by time with sweetness fraught; Be thou their glory-tinted solitude, The cradle and the home of generous thought! V. TO THE THAMES AT WESTMINSTER. IN RECOLLECTION OF THE BANKS OF THE SAME RIVER, AT CAVERSHAM, NEAR READING. With no cold admiration do I gaze Upon thy pomp of waters, matchless stream! But home-sick fancy kindles with the beam That on thy lucid bosom faintly plays; And glides delighted through thy crystal ways, Till on her eye those wave-fed poplars gleam, Beneath whose shade her first ethereal maze She fashion'd; where she traced in clearest dream Thy mirror'd course of wood-enshrined repose Besprent with island haunts of spirits bright; And widening on—till, at the vision's close, Great London, only then a name of might For childish thought to build on, proudly rose A rock-throned city clad in heavenly light. VI. TO THE SAME RIVER. I may not emulate their lofty aim, Who, in divine imagination, bold, With mighty hills and streams communion hold, As living friends; and scarce I dare to claim Acquaintance with thee in thy scenes of fame, Wealthiest of rivers, though in days of old I loved thee where thy waters sylvan roll'd, And still would deem thee in thy pride the same! So love perversely cleaves to some old mate Estranged by fortune; in his very pride Seems lifted; waxes in his greatness great; And silent hails the lot it prophesied,— Content to think in manhood's palmy state Some lingering traces of the child abide. VII. TO MR. MACREADY, ON HIS PERFORMANCE OF WERNER, IN LORD BYRON'S TRAGEDY OF THAT NAME. O learned in affection's thousand ways! I thought thy art had proved its happiest power, When thou didst bend above the opening flower Of sweet Virginia's beauty, and with praise Measured in words but fineless in the gaze Of the proud sire, her gentle secret won: Or when the patriot archer's hardy son Was school'd by doting sternness for the hour Of glorious peril; but the just designs Were ready; now thy soul's affections glow, By thy own genius train'd, through frigid lines, And make a scorner's bloodless fancy show, When love disdain'd round its cold idol twines, How mighty are its weakness and its woe! VIII. FAME—THE SYMBOL AND PROOF OF IMMORTALITY. The names that slow oblivion have defied, And passionate ambition's wildest shocks Stand in lone grandeur, like eternal rocks, To cast broad shadows o'er the silent tide Of time's unebbing flood, whose waters glide, To ponderous darkness from their secret spring, And, bearing on each transitory thing, Leave those old monuments in loneliest pride. There stand they—fortresses uprear'd by man, Whose earthly frame is mortal; symbols high Of power unchanging,—thought that cannot die: Proofs that our nature mocks its earthly span, And claims an essence by its God allied To life and joy and love unperishing. IX. TO MR. MACREADY, ON THE BIRTH OF HIS FIRST CHILD; IN RECOLLECTION OF HIS PERFORMANCE OF VIRGINIUS. There is no father, who, with swimming eyes, Has seen thee present life and passion lend To scenes by simple-hearted poet penn'd, Depicting household love in Roman guise, Which, breathed through ancient forms, in freshness vies With love of yesterday, who does not send A greeting to thee as a new-bless'd friend, Now thy own heart acknowledges the ties Which skill, forestalling nature, made thee guess With finest apprehension, and commend To tearful crowds;—yet while the sweet excess Of joy that thou hast passion'd forth, shall fill Thy soul with all it dream'd of happiness, May grief remain the artist's fiction still! X. TO CHARLES DICKENS, ON HIS “OLIVER TWIST.” Not only with the author's happiest praise Thy work should be rewarded; 'tis akin To deeds of men, who, scorning ease to win A blessing for the wretched, pierce the maze Which heedless ages spread around the ways Where fruitful Sorrow tracks its parent Sin; Content to listen to the wildest din Of passion, and on dismal shapes to gaze, So they may earn the power which intercedes With the bright world and melts it; for within Wan childhood's squalid haunts, where basest needs Make tyranny more bitter, at thy call, An angel face with patient sweetness pleads For infant suffering to the heart of all. XI. TO MISS ADELAIDE KEMBLE, ON HER APPROACHING RETIREMENT FROM THE STAGE. (DECEMBER, 1842.) If Time has doom'd the triumphs of thy race With loss of thee—the youngest and the last— To take majestic station in the Past, We thank thee that thy fleeting hours embrace Some hint of all its glories;—bid us trace In thy proud action the unconquer'd will Of the great Roman; own once more a thrill Akin to that which blanch'd the childish face At Siddons' whisper; bless the honest grace Which the true heart of chivalry should still Shed o'er thy father's brow;—consoled that all, Thus waning into memory, grow more sweet, And make their last expressions musical, To live while any heart they hush shall beat. XII. ON THE RECEPTION OF THE POET WORDSWORTH AT OXFORD (1839). Never till now did mighty truth prevail With such felicities of place and time, As in those shouts sent forth with joy sublime From the full heart of England's Youth, to hail Her once neglected bard, within the pale Of Learning's fairest Citadel! That voice, In which the Future thunders bids rejoice Some who through wintry fortunes did not fail To bless with love as deep as life, the name Thus welcomed;—who, in happy silence, share The triumph; while their fondest musings claim Unhoped-for echoes in the joyous air, That to their long-loved Poet's spirit bear A Nation's promise of undying fame. XIII. THE MEMORY OF THE POETS. The fame of those pure bards whose fancies lie Like glorious clouds in summer's calmest even, Fringing the western skirts of darkening heaven, And sprinkled o'er with hues of rainbow dye, Awakes no voice of thunder, which may vie With mighty chiefs' renown;—from ages gone, In low undying strain, it lengthens on, The wildest solitudes with joy to fill,— Felt breathing in the silence of the sky, Or trembling in the gush of new-born rill, Or whispering o'er the lake's unrippled breast; And, when all mortal voices shall be still, Preserved to mingle earth-born ecstacy With the calm rapture of eternal rest. XIV. ETON COLLEGE. SURVEYED AFTER LEAVING A SON AT SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME. How often have I fix'd a stranger's gaze On yon famed turrets, clad in light as fair As this sweet evening lends, and felt the air Of learning that from calm of ancient days Breathes round them ever! Now to me they wear Hues drawn from dearer thought; the radiant haze That mantles them grows thick with fondest care, And its slant sunbeams flicker like the praise Youth wins from wisdom;—for in yon retreats One little student's heart expectant beats With blood of mine;—O God! vouchsafe him power, When I am dust, to stand on this sweet place, And, through the vista of long years, embrace With cloudless soul this first Etonian hour! XV. TO LORD DENMAN. RESIGNING THE OFFICE OF LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND. There is a rapture in the great All Hail With which a nation honours thy repose, That proves thy image deathless—that the close Of man's remotest age, whose boyhood glows While pondering o'er thy lineaments, shall fail To delegate to cold historic tale What Denman was; for dignity that flows Not in the moulds of compliment extern, But from the noble spirit's purest urn, Springs vital; justice shrined from wintry flaw By beautiful regards, and thoughts that burn With generous ire, within the soul shall draw No form but thine, when distant times would learn The embodied majesty of England's Law. XVI. TO A LADY VISITING CHAMOUNI, FOR THE FIRST TIME, FROM GENEVA. May Nature's stateliest palace to your gaze Expand in happiest lustre! May the sun Light into radiant joy the streams that run Aslant the herbage of the rock-bound ways Down which the strong Arve thunders; may his rays Spread myriad colours o'er the fount that springs Aloft in watery dust, and leaping flings A shadow scarce less earthly! May no cloud At eve on Europe's stainless summit rest When roseate beauty lingering should attest Its lone supremacy, which noon will fail To vindicate,—or hint of cares to shroud In after time that mirror in the breast Which shall reflect the Mountain and the Vale! XVII. THE WESTMINSTER PLAY. Not from the youth-illumined stage alone Is gladness shed; it breathes around from all Whose names imprinted on each honour'd wall Speak deathless boyhood; on whose hearts the tone That makes a classic phrase familiar grown New by its crisp expression, seem to fall From distant years; while shouting striplings, still On life's gay verge, make younger bosoms thrill With proud delight which lately charm'd their own; While richest humour strangely serves to fill Worn eyes with child-like tears; for memory lifts Time's curtain from the soul's remotest stage, And sympathy makes strangers share the gifts That clasp in golden meshes youth and age. XVIII. ON LOUGH'S STATUE OF LADY MACBETH. If this great image were by ocean thrown Among some people who have never yet Learn'd in the mind's creations to forget Life's pressure, and the melancholy stone Were on a rock for savage wonder set, Methinks some sense of Shakspeare's world unknown Would dawn on spirits reverential grown To strange divinity, as if they met A bodied fragment of the poet's soul;— And while the spectral gaze and withering hand Urge silence, such as that which death's control Rules,—on the thoughts of that astonish'd band Shapes from the noblest scenes by mortal plann'd Would rise, and breathe the grandeur of the whole. XIX. RECOLLECTION OF THE LATE SIR M. A. SHEE, PRESIDING FOR THE LAST TIME AT THE FESTIVAL OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY. If in the fluttering music of that tongue Some trace of years, through which its accents grew Sweet amidst forms of beauty, should renew An old regret that spirits ever young Must, as they verge on regions whence they sprung, Pay in expression's weaken'd force the due To frail mortality by which alone They speak to earth, our hearts attend its tone With eagerness more rapt than when it flung Abroad the vigorous truth by fancy's hue Imbued—for, as the seeds from o'erblown flowers, By autumn's gentle breath for spring are sown, These trembling words, embraced by kindred powers, Shall glow in pictures distant times shall own. XX. TO ROBERT BROWNING. SUGGESTED BY A SUNSET OF UNUSUAL BEAUTY. A mighty sorrow gathers while the eye Is by the sunset's waning glories fed, For they recal the forms of poets dead, Who with the first of mighty ages vie, And lately veil'd by earth's horizon, shed Sad beauty from beneath it;—yet a power, Like the pale moon that to their lustrous hour Gave the meek tribute of a young ally Felt more than own'd, consoling light should shower From crystal urn that holds the precious dower Of Browning's genius—which, when breezes rend Fond clouds its lavish splendours glorify, Made free of azure fields, its course shall wend To high dominion in serenest sky. LINES WRITTEN AT THE NEEDLES HOTEL, ALUM BAY, ISLE OF WIGHT AFTER A WEEK SPENT AT THAT PLACE. How simple in their grandeur are the forms That constitute this picture! Nature grants Scarce more than sternest cynic might desire— Earth, Sea, and Sky, and hardly lends to each Variety of colour; yet the soul Asks nothing fairer than the scene it grasps And makes its own for ever! From the gate Of this home-breathing Inn, which nestling cleaves To its own shelf among the downs, begirt With trees which lift no branches to defy The fury of the storm, but crouch in love Round the low snow-white walls whence they receive More shelter than they lend,—the heart-sooth'd guest Views a furze-dotted common, on each side Wreathed into waving eminences, clothed Above the furze with scanty green, in front Indented sharply to admit the sea, Spread thence in softest blue—to which a gorge Sinking within the valley's deepening green Invites by grassy path; the Eastern down Swelling with pride into the waters, shows Its sward-tipp'd precipice of radiant white, And claims the dazzling peak beneath its brow Part of its ancient bulk, which hints the strength Of those famed pinnacles that still withstand The conquering waves, as fortresses maintain'd By death-devoted troops, hold out awhile After the game is lost, to grace for ever The virtue of the conquer'd.—Here are scarce Four colours for the painter; yet the charm Which permanence, 'mid earthly change, confers Is felt, if ever, here; for he who loves To bid the scene refresh his inward eye When far away, may feel it keeping still The very aspect that it wore for him, Scarce changed by time or season: autumn finds Scant boughs on which the lustre of decay May tremble fondly; storms may rage in vain Above the clumps of sturdy furze, which stand The forest of the fairies; twilight grey Finds in the landscape's stern and simple forms Nought to conceal; the moon, although she casts Upon the element she sways, a track Like that which slanted through young Jacob's sleep From heaven to earth, and flutter'd at the soul Of shadow's mighty painter, who thence drew Hints of a glory beyond shape, reveals The clear-cut frame work of the sea and downs Shelving to gloom, as unperplex'd with threads Of pallid light, as when the summer's noon Bathes them in sunshine; and the giant cliffs Scarce veiling more their lines of flint that run Like veins of moveless blue through glistening white, In moonlight than in day, shall tower as now, (Save when some moss's slender stain shall break Into the samphire's yellow in mid air, To tempt some trembling life) until the eyes Which gaze in childhood on them shall be dim. Yet deem not that these sober forms are all That Nature here provides, although she frames These in one lasting picture for the heart. Within the foldings of the coast she breathes Hues of fantastic beauty. Thread the gorge And, turning on the beach, while the low sea Spread out in mirror'd gentleness, allows A path along the curving edge, behold Such dazzling glory of prismatic tints Flung o'er the lofty crescent, as assures The orient gardens where Aladdin pluck'd His jewell'd fruit no fable,—as if earth, Provoked to emulate the rainbow's pomp In lasting mould, had snatch'd its floating hues And fix'd them here; for never o'er the bay Flew a celestial arch of brighter grace Than the gay coast exhibits; here the cliff Flaunts in a brighter yellow than the stream Of Tiber wafted; then through softer shades Declines to pearly white, which blushes soon With pink as delicate as autumn's rose Wears on its scattering leaves; anon the shore Recedes into a fane-like dell, where stain'd With black, as if with sable tapestry hung, Light pinnacles rise taper: further yet Swells out in solemn mass a dusky veil Of purpled crimson,—while bright streaks of red Start out in gleam-like tint, to tell of veins Which the slow-winning sea, in distant times, Shall bare to unborn gazers. If this scene Grow too fantastic for thy pensive thought, Climb either swelling down, and gaze with joy On the blue ocean, pour'd around the heights, As it embraced the wonders of that shield Which the doom'd friend of slain Patroclus wore, To grace his fated valour; nor disdain The quiet of the vale, though not endow'd With such luxurious beauty as the coast Of Undercliff embosoms. 'Mid those lines Of scanty foliage, thoughtful lanes and paths, And cottage roofs, find shelter; the blue stream, That with its brightness almost threads the isle, Flows blest with two grey towers, beneath whose shade The village life sleeps trustfully,—whose rites Touch the old weather-harden'd fisher's heart With child-like softness, and shall teach the boy Who kneels, a sturdy grandson, at his side, When his frail boat amidst the breakers strikes, To cast the anchor of a Christian's hope In an unrippled haven. Then rejoice, That in remotest point of this sweet isle, Which with fond mimicry combines each shape Of the great land that, by the ancient bond (Sea-parted once, and sea-united now), Binds her in unity—a Spirit breathes On cliff, and tower, and valley, by the side Of cottage-fire, and the low grass-grown grave, Of Home on English earth, and Home in Heaven! VERSES TO THE MEMORY OF A CHILD, WHO, NAMED AFTER CHARLES LAMB, DIED A YEAR AFTER HIM, AT BRIGHTON. Our gentle Charles has pass'd away From earth's short bondage free, And left to us its leaden day And mist-enshrouded sea. Here, by the ocean's terraced side, Sweet hours of hope were known, When first the triumph of its tide Seem'd omen of our own. That eager joy the sea-breeze gave, When first it raised his hair, Sunk with each day's retiring wave, Beyond the reach of prayer. The sun-blink that through drizzling mist, To flickering hope akin, Lone waves with feeble fondness kiss'd, No smile as faint can win; Yet not in vain with radiance weak The heavenly stranger gleams— Not of the world it lights to speak, But that from whence it streams. That world our patient sufferer sought, Serene with pitying eyes, As if his mounting spirit caught The wisdom of the skies. With boundless love it look'd abroad For one bright moment given, Shone with a loveliness that awed, And quiver'd into Heaven. A year made slow by care and toil Has paced its weary round, Since death enrich'd with kindred spoil The snow-clad, frost-ribb'd ground. Then Lamb, with whose endearing name Our boy we proudly graced, Shrank from the warmth of sweeter fame Than ever bard embraced. Still 'twas a mournful joy to think Our darling might supply, For years to us, a living link With name that cannot die. And though such fancy gleam no more On earthly sorrow's night, Truth's nobler torch unveils the shore Which lends to both its light. The nurseling there that hand may take None ever grasp'd in vain, And smiles of well-known sweetness wake, Without their tinge of pain. Though, 'twixt the child and childlike bard Late seem'd distinction wide, They now may trace, in Heaven's regard, How near they were allied. Within the infant's ample brow Blythe fancies lay unfurl'd, Which all uncrush'd may open now To charm a sinless world. Though the soft spirit of those eyes Might ne'er with Lamb's compete— Ne'er sparkle with a wit as wise, Or melt in tears, as sweet, The nurseling's unforgotten look A kindred love reveals, With his who never friend forsook, Or hurt a thing that feels. In thought profound, in wildest glee, In sorrow's lengthening range, His guileless soul of infancy Endured no spot or change. From traits of each our love receives For comfort nobler scope; While light which childlike genius leaves Confirms the infant's hope: And in that hope with sweetness fraught Be aching hearts beguiled, To blend in one delightful thought The Poet and the Child.</field>
