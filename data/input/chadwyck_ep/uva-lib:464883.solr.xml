      <field name="fulltext">Delectando pariterque monendo. Hor. TO Mrs Hannah Wood, GOVERNESS OF THE Young Ladies Boarding School AT St. Edmund's Bury, IN THE County of SUFFOLK: THESE MISCELLANEOUS AMUSEMENTS ARE, With all due Respect, inscribed BY Her very affectionate Friend, and Brother, D. BELLAMY. THREE SELECT SCENES IN Italian and English, Of a celebrated Musical Entertainment, Entitled IL PASTOR FIDO. Written Originally By GUARINI. Dolce Vita amorosa! Guar. Act I. Scene I. Silvio and Linco. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Silv. read Silvio For Linc. read Linco For Myr. read Myrtillo For Erga. read Ergasto Linco. Oh, Silvio! Hadst thou e'er tasted the extatick Pleasure, Truly to love, and be belov'd again, Thy adamantine Heart would quickly soften; Soon would'st thou cherish the fond Flame within thee; Soon would'st thou think thy present Life insipid, And murmur to have liv'd so long without it. No more the Pleasures of the Woods approve: Leave, leave all other Sports for godlike Love. Silv. Talk not to me of thy fantastic Flames: I tell thee, Linco, that I value more One brindled Boar, by my Melampo caught, Than Thousands of those Nymphs thou so extol'st. Let those, who have a nicer Taste than I, The Beauties of the Plains with Pride enjoy; I cannot relish such Society. Linc. Silvio, thy Soul is out of Tune— But have a Care; the Hour will one Day come, When thou must own Love's soft Supremacy. Sooner or later, once he triumphs o'er us, Asserts his Right, and claims our due Allegiance. Believe me, Silvio, (For I, by sad Experience, know the Truth on't.) No greater Pain can Mortal undergo, Than in his Evening, his Decline of Life, To feel the sharp, the piercing Stings of Love: For then, no Cure can for the Wound be found, And every Application when renew'd Does but enflame, and make it rage the more. When e'er in Youth he strikes his Arrows deep, He quickly cures himself the Wounds he makes; Eases his Patient's Pains with future Hopes, And with a Smile atones for former Frowns. But if his Arrows once transfix the Old, (Who cannot attribute their Nymphs Disdain To any Thing but the Decay of Nature) Then are the Wounds he makes incurable, And all their Pains too sharp for human Suff'rance. Prithee, dear Silvio, do not hasten on thee The Curse of Time, before the Time appointed; For, Oh! to learn to love, when thou art old, Will sting thy drooping Soul with double Torture. How wilt thou then upon thyself reflect, That in thy Youth thou did Love's Charms neglect! No more the Pleasures of the Woods approve: Leave, leave all other Sports for godlike Love. Silv. As if there were no Pleasures to pursue, But those which you fantastick Lovers know. Linc. Tell me if in the jovial Month of May, When the gay Earth is deck'd in all her Glory, Should'st thou, instead of verdant flow'ry Meads, Instead of shady Groves and purling Streams, Behold the Pine, the Ash, the Oak, all leafless; The Ground without a Flow'r, the Floods congeal'd, Would'st thou not say, that Nature was inverted, The Universe was sick, and just expiring? Now, Silvio, turn thy Eyes upon thyself, And thou wilt see a Prodigy in Nature, As horrible as this: To different Ages, Heaven has bestowed Diversity of Passions: And as fond Love but ill becomes the Old, So he that's Young, and disregards the Fair, Thwarts the Design of Nature and of Heav'n, Silvio, look round:— Examine all the Works of the Creation. And thou wilt find 'em all th' Effects of Love. Dost thou not see yon Messenger of Day? Ev'n she herself does Cupid's Pow'r obey. This Moment sure she left her God of War, She looks so gay and so divinely fair. Love fires the Beasts that haunt the desart Woods, And bulky Whales that lord it in the Floods. The Nightingale, that tunes his warbling Throat, And strikes thine Ear with such a pleasing Note, That wantonly from Beach to Beach does move, Could he but speak, would say, I burn with Love. Love sparkles in his little wanton Eyes, And his soft Warblings Want of Speech supplies. His pretty tender Mate knows what they mean, And listens to them with a pleasing Pain. The lusty Bull ranges the Pastures round, And bellows as he runs, and spurns the Ground; But then those awful Sounds, those Gestures prove Not the Result of Anger, but of Love. The Lion roars within the desart Wood, More for his absent Mate than Want of Food. In short, there's no created Thing, but thee, That is from Love's Almighty Power free. And shall my Silvio no Devotion pay To him, that bears such universal Sway? No more the Pleasures of the Woods approve: Leave, leave all other Sports for god-like Love. Silv. Were then my tender blooming Years, dost think, Entrusted to thy Care for nothing else, But to attend thy soft romantic Lectures, Thy love-sick Stories, which my Soul abhors? Pray, Linco, recollect thyself, and know The Inequality there is betwixt us. Linc. I am a Man, proud Youth, and thou'rt no more. And glory in my mortal Composition. If thy ambitious Soul disdains the Title, And takes her Flight beyond a human Pitch, Take Care thou doesn't sink beneath ev'n Manhood, In aiming to be something more than Man. Silv. My great, my valiant Grandsire Hercules, Who quell'd the savage Monsters of the Woods, Whose Blood runs briskly thro' my youthful Veins, Had never been recorded in Fame's Annals, Had he not first subdu'd that Monster, Love. Linc. Pride and Ambition, Silvio, blind thy Reason. Where hadst thou been? How, pray, hadst thou been born, Had thy Alcides never felt Love's Pow'r? Nay all the glorious Actions he perform'd, The many Conquests that he gain'd in Battle, Were all the Effects of this Almighty Passion. Hast thou not heard, how the Fair Omphale Made him confess the Triumph of her Eyes, And bound him Captive by her magic Charms? How he resign'd his rugged Lion's Skin, To deck himself in all her female Glory? How he sat down to learn her little Arts, And turn'd his knotty Club into a Distaff? Thus would he shift the Scene, and when fatigu'd With the hard Toil, and Hazard of the Day, In her soft Arms repose himself at Night; There make amends for all his Labours past; Surfeit on Joy till ev'n Desire grew sick; And then his former Toils again repeat. If then thy haughty Soul would imitate The glorious warlike Deeds thy Grandsire wrought; Tho' still thou dost in Woods delight to rove, Yet do not banish quite the Thoughts of Love: Sometimes to Amaryllis's Charms resign; Her Blood's as noble, and as rich as thine. That thou dost shun Dorinda's proffer'd Love, I do not only pardon but approve. Thine Honour, which thou dost so highly prize, Will not permit th' unlawful Flame to rise; Can ne'er consent thou basely should'st abuse So great, so worthy, so divine a Spouse. Silv. That she's my Spouse, as yet thou can'st not say. Linc. Were there not solemn Vows between you past? Take Care, proud Youth, you don't the Gods distast. Silv. The Gift of Freedom, is the Gift of Jove; He ne'er regards compulsive Vows of Love. Linc. Nay, but I tell thee, Silvio, Jove looks down, And makes this Match a Bus'ness of his own; Has promis'd to attend thy Nuptial Rites, And crown 'em with unheard-of, new Delights. Silv. Canst think that Jove would break his sweet Repose, To mind such trivial Things, as Lover's Vows? I tell thee, Amaryllis I despise, Nor am I mov'd with fair Dorinda's Eyes: No Female Planet rul'd when I was born: The Queen of Love with all her Charms I scorn. Diana is the Goddess I approve, And I'm resolv'd thro' all her Woods to rove, Linc. Hard-hearted Youth! I scarcely can believe Thou dost from Gods, or Men, thy Race derive. Or, if thy Father was a mortal Man, Thro' all his Veins Alecto's Poisons ran. When in his Arms thy Mother he carest, Tysiphone alone his Heart possest. Scene II. Myrtillo and Ergasto. Myrtillo. Obdurate Maid! whose Amarillis comprehensive Name Shews that the Sweets of Love are dash'd with Gall; More beauteous art thou than the blushing Rose, Fairer than Lillies, gayer than the Morn; But deaf, alas! to all my Sighs and Tears; Deaf as the Winds, the Waters, or the Weather. Since then my Words have lost the Pow'r to please, Like Ravens Notes sound harsh unto thy Ears, In solemn Silence I will die before thee; Without a Groan will at thy Feet expire.— Yet all in vain—There's not a Hill, or Vale, Or murmuring Tree in yonder shady Grove, (On which so often I have carv'd thy Name, To which I have so oft reveal'd my Passion) But will proclaim my cruel Fate aloud. Each Rill shall shed a sympathysing Tear, Each Zephyr fills with Sighs the ambient Air: Pity and Grief shall in my Eyes be read, And my unhappy Cause by Turns shall plead. At last,— If all my Wrongs can no Compassion move, My Death itself to all the World shall prove, I fell a Victim to the God of Love. Erga. Love is, my Friend, a Pain unspeakable! But to suppress it still augments my Pain. As the hot Courser, when he feels the Curb, With double Speed scow'rs o'er the dusty Plain; So Love restrain'd, and in the Breast confin'd, With double Fury burns, and wrecks the Sense. In vain thou striv'st to hide the Secret from me; For I have look'd into thy artless Bosom, And view'd the Hurry which thy Soul is in. How often have I said, Myrtillo loves, But will not tell the Object he adores! Myr. Nor would I now reveal my luckless Passion, Did not Necessity extort it from me. What is my Happiness compar'd to her's? Rather I'd drag this Load of Life in Pain, Than in the least disturb my Fair One's Quiet. 'Tis whisper'd, my Ergasto, thro' our Plain, (And oh! the News strikes thro' my trembling Heart) That Hymen will To-morrow join the Hands Of Amaryllis, and some happy Swain; But who, as yet, my Friend, I cannot learn: Nor dare I ask, lest I reveal my Flame, And find the Truth of what my Soul abhors. I know, alas! too well my abject State, (For Love has not so far my Reason blinded) Ever to hope that Heav'n would bless my Arms With such a Nymph, so exquisitely form'd, Adorn'd with every Grace, that Nature's Hand Could lavishly with all her Art bestow: Whose Mind is still superior to those Charms, And speaks its Essence to be all divine. No—Some ill Planet rul'd when I was born.— I'm doom'd to love, but never to enjoy. 'Tis Death, and Death alone can heal my Sorrows; And since my Fate's to be in Love with Death, With utmost Pleasure I'd this Life forego; With Extasy expire, so that the lovely Charmer Would bless me with her Eyes, and seal my Fate. I have but this, this only Boon to ask, That she would hear her poor Myrtillo speak, Before she gives herself away forever. Now generous Youth— If I am one in whom thy Soul takes Pleasure, Since Passion overbears me, plays the Tyrant, And hurries my unstable, flitting Soul To Madness and Despair;—Pity my Sorrows, And lend me, if thou can'st, thy helping Hand. Erg. A small Request for a poor, dying Lover; Yet to accomplish what thy Soul desires, Is a hard Task, and of the last Importance. Should the fair Nymph's stern Father chance to hear His Daughter listen'd to thy Love-sick Story; Or should the fatal News once reach the Ears Of the High Priest Montano, (Silvio's Father) The Darling of thy Soul is lost forever. For this, and this alone perhaps she flies thee: Her Frowns perhaps may prove but Artifice, And her fond Heart may pity thee in private. Women are more inclin'd to Love than Men; But with more Art conceal the raging Pain. Grant this Suggestion true—Tell me, Myrtillo, Hasn't she Reason to deny the Visit? In vain she listens to her Lover's Tale, Who wants the Pow'r his wounded Soul to heal; Admits him to her Presence but in vain, When the soft Interview will but augment his Pain. And he, Myrtillo, doubtless is to blame, Who loves, despairs, and yet still fans the Flame. Myr. O! Could I once but entertain that Thought, My anxious Pain would prove the greatest Pleasure. But, my dear Friend, (so may the Gods smile on thee) Do not conceal the fatal Secret from me. Confirm my Fate, and boldly name the Swain, The happy Swain, the Darling of the Stars. Erg. Dost thou not know the Rich, the gallant Sylvio, Montano's only Son?—'Tis he. Myr. Thrice happy Swain! To have thy Stars dart down Their gentle Influence so early on thee! Forgive me, if thou hear'st my tender Sighs; I envy not thy Fate, but mourn my own. Erg. Thou shouldstn't envy him; indeed Myrtillo, He claims thy Pity rather. Myr. What! Pity, say'st thou. Erg. Yes, thy Pity; for he cannot love her. Myr. Is he a Man? and is his Heart untouch'd? Can he be blind to such a World of Charms? Or has her Eyes shot all her Fires at me, And lest no Dart for any other Breast? But why must such a glorious, matchless Prize Be thrown into the Arms of one, who scorns, Or values not th' inestimable Blessing! Erg. Soon as their nuptial Rites shall be perform'd, Indulgent Heav'n has promis'd to avert The direful Judgments that attend Arcadia. Hast thou not heard how our offended Goddess Each Year demands a spotless Virgin's Blood, (A barbarous Tribute!) from our guilty Land. Myr. Never Ergasto— Nor blame, nor wonder at my Ignorance, Since 'tis but lately that I came amongst you; And since (so Love and Fate decreed) 'till now I've been The constant Tenant of the shady Groves. But say— What heinous Crime has Arcady committed, To draw such Vengeance on her guilty Head, And rouse such Fury in a Goddess' Breast? Erg. Since then thou hast not heard the fatal Story, I'll tell thee such a mournful, horrid Tale, Would rend ev'n Rocks, and soften knotted Oaks, Much more incline thy tender Soul to Pity. Before the sacred Priesthood was confin'd To one peculiar Age, a gallant Youth, Diana's favourite Priest (by Name Amyntas) Confess'd the Triumph of Lucrina's Eyes. The God of Love shot all his Fires from thence Into his Soul, and his whole Heart receiv'd them. The Nymph was made in Nature's purest Mould Without Alloy, her Form was all divine. Heav'n, Heav'n itself was seated in her Eyes, But Hell, all Hell in her false treacherous Heart: For a long Time she crown'd Amyntas' Pains With gentle Smiles, and seem'd at least to burn With mutual Flames; long fed his Hopes with Vows. Of everlasting Truth, and constant Love: And (while no Rival came t'oppose his Wishes) He reign'd sole Monarch of her faithless Heart. But (Curse on the Jilt!) soon as another Swain Whispered his Love-sick Story in her Ears, The treacherous Nymph, transported at her Conquest, And raging with a Flood of, new Desires, Forgot the numerous Vows she made Amyntas, And seal'd his Ruin e'er he new the Cause; With utmost Detestation shunn'd his Presence. And swore she'd see the hated Youth no more. If now Ingratitude looks so black as this Should raise a Tempest in his troubl'd Soul, And drive him to Despair, thou best canst judge, Who know'st a Lover's Pains by sad Experience. Myr. Oh! 'Tis beyond the Power of Words to paint Distress like his. Erg. —At last th' unhappy Youth, Finding her deaf to all his Sighs and Tears, (Deaf as the Winds, and as the Rocks unshaken) All prostrate at Diana's sacred Altar. With trembling Accent thus bespoke his Goddess. If with an upright Heart, and guiltless Hand, I ever offer'd Sacrifice before thee; If e'er my Service has been grateful to thee, Then from thy awful Seat above look down, Assert my Cause, and plead it as thy own. Pour down thy Vengeance on the guilty Head Of that too lovely Fair, but cruel Maid, Who with her perjur'd Breath my honest Heart betray'd' With good Success the Youth preferr'd his Pray'rs. Cynthia look'd down, and heard his heavy Sighs, Saw all his Tears, and pity'd his Distress. Her Pity kindled in her Breast Revenge, And fann'd the furious Flame; so strait she took Her fatal Blow in her all-pow'rful Hand; Out of her Quiver drew her keenest Arrows, And shot them in the Bosom of Arcadia. Swift as the forky Light'ning round they flew, Unerring, and unseen; and sure Destruction Attended every Dart. No Age, no Sex, they spar'd; Relentless, did perform their dire Commission. In vain to distant Rocks th' Arcadian flies, Within the Rocks the dire Contagion lies. Fruitless are Antidotes with Skill apply'd; The Artist falls by his weak Patient's Side. Man's utmost Efforts now prove ineffectual, And Heav'n alone can mitigate his Sorrows. So to the nearest Oracle he flies, To know what Terms the angry God propound; What Tribute they expect t'avert the Judgment. Soon from the sacred Shrine this Answer came, That Cynthia was provok'd, and to appease Her kindled Wrath, and seal Arcadia's Peace, Lucrina on her Altar must be laid; Or in her Stead, some false, but beauteous Maid, And by the Hands of wrong'd Amyntas bleed. Fruitless are all her Sighs, and flowing Tears; In vain she flies to her new Lover's Arms, And with her melting Eyes implores his Aid In vain, to save her from approaching Ruin. The beauteous Nymph, like a gay Bride adorn'd, Was to Diana's Temple strait conducted, In all the Splendour and the solemn Pomp Religion could devise.—Soon as the Victim came, All pale, and trembling to the sacred Altar, (Her lovely Eyes all drown'd in Floods of Sorrows) Prostrate she fell before her injur'd Lover, Expecting from his Hands the Stroke of Death. Boldly the Youth his sacred Dagger drew; His Breast with Indignation seem'd to burn, This shocking Answer, horrible to Nature, His Brows to knit, his angry Eyes to roll With glowing Vengeance, Fury and Despair. At last, with a deep Sigh (Death's Harbinger) And Looks compos'd, he thus bespoke the Maid: O! thou too lovely, faithless, perjur'd Nymph, Judge of my Wrongs by this tremendous Blow. This said—he plung'd the fatal Weapon deep Into his sacred Breast; and at her trembling Feet The Victim, and the Priest fell down together. Like one that stands upon the Verge of Life, Confounded and surprised, Lucrina shiver'd, Doubtful as yet, which had transfix'd her Heart, Excess of Sorrow, or the Dread of Death. Soon as her scatter'd Senses were-recall'd, And her lost Speech return'd; she sighing, said, O, generous Youth! I know thy wondrous Worth, Thy Constancy and Love, alas! too late. The Sight of thee thus dying by my Side, At once revives, and wounds my bleeding Heart. If I have sinn'd (as doubtless I have sinn'd) In flying from th' Embrace of one so good; My Life shall make Atonement for th' Offence, And my freed Soul should dwell with thine forever, With that she took the Poynard from his Breast, Warm with his precious Blood, and plung'd it deep Into her own.—Trembling and faint, she fell Into his dying Arms, who just had Life, Feebly to fold the Fair, and die with Pleasure. Thus fell the too indulgent, constant Swain, Thus was the Nymph undone by her Disdain. Myr. Unhappy Youth!—Yet happy in thy Love! What Opportunity more great, more glorious, Could'st thou have had, to shew th' unshaken Faith? Who would not die to melt the scornful Fair? But what became of the distress'd Arcadians? Did the Contagion cease? Was Cynthia's Anger Perfectly appeas'd? Erg. The Storm, indeed, abated for a Time; But Oh! we never had a perfect Calm. In the same Month of the ensuing Year It rag'd with greater Fury than before. With Speed again to Cynthia's Shrine we flew, But soon receiv'd an Answer more surprizing, More horrible to Nature than the first, That Cynthia did expect to be obey'd; That then, and every Year, a Bride, or Maid, (Not Twenty) on her Altar should be laid. This, when comply'd with, and the Victim slain, The Goddess would remove our raging Pain. Nor was this all: The Goddess to torment Th' unhappy Sex, prescrib'd this cruel Law, A Law (which if we weigh their Natures well) We know they ne'er can keep; a Law that's wrote Without Remorse, in Characters of Blood. That every Bride, or Virgin, who should prove Inconstant to the Swain she once did love, Should without Mercy in an Instant die, Unless some Friend would the Nymph's Place supply. This national Calamity now old Montano Hopes to remove by this intended Match. For when again we to the Shrine apply'd, To know what Remedy the Heav'ns prescrib'd, To heal the anxious Griefs our Land groan'd under; After some Pause, this Answer was return'd. Cynthia will never smile, Nor hush the raging Storm; 'Till two of Race divine Shall Hymen's Rites perform: 'Till some Fair, generous Maid Shall bless her faithful Swain; With Constancy Atonement make For the false Nymph's Disdain. Now, throughout all Arcadia, none are left Who claim a Title to celestial Birth, But Silvio and Amaryllis: She The Daughter of the mighty Pan, and he Alcides' Son. Nor has there met 'till now, (So much the harder our unhappy Fate!) Two Branches of those Lines of different Sex. Not without Grounds Montano therefore hopes (Tho' what the sacred Oracle foretold Is not as yet in every Point accomplish'd) To find our Remedy in this Alliance. This is the fundamental Part; the rest Lies hid at present in the Breast of Fate: Which, when the nuptial Rites shall be perform'd, Will visibly appear. Myr. Never was Swain so wretched sure as I am! What Combination's here! What Pow'rs conspire To ruin one, half-dead with Grief already! Is't not enough the Pangs of Love to bear, That I must wage with Fate unequal War? Erg. Cease thy Complainings, cease thy flowing Tears; Tears will not cool, but fan Loves raging Fires. Chear up, my Friend, and let's to yonder Grove, Some Stratagem Ergasto will devise, ('Ere yet the Sun shall in the Ocean set) To introduce thee to thy Charmer's Presence. With Sighs thou striv'st to sooth thy Griefs in vain; Thy Sighs will prove but an Addition to thy Pain. So when a Fire a Field of Corn does seize, If the Wind's hush, it burns by slow Degrees: But if a furious Tempest chance to rise, At once the Flame does the whole Field surprize, And mounts with Fury to the distant Skies. Scene III. Corisca.What Words can paint the Passion which I feel? The wild Disorder of my Soul reveal? Is it not strange two Contraries should meet, And such Intestine, Civil War create? That Love and Hatred should possess my Breast, And banish thence all Hopes, all Thoughts of Rest? When I survey Mirtillo's beauteous Face, Each Lineament, each lovely Feature trace, Think on each Motion, each attractive Grace: Whene'er I hear his soft melodious Tongue, Or listen to the Musick of his Song; My Soul's on Fire; with Extasy I move, And every other Passion yields to Love. But when I think how the disdainful Boy Beholds another with triumphant Joy; With Pride avoids my eager longing Arms, (Wilfully blind to my superior Charms) The furious Storm begins again to rise, My rage revives, and I the Youth despise. What! Shall I tamely bear his proud Disdain? Sue for a Shepherd's Love, and sue in vain? Shall he presume to slight my dazzling Charms, And revel in a meaner Beauty's Arms? Audacious Villain! to be mov'd no more, To view my Eyes, and not my Eyes adore! To view my Charms, and yet so senseless prove, As not to languish, not to burn for Love! Shall I submit, when he should prostrate lie, Be proud like others at my Feet to die? Oh! no:—The Shock my Heart can never bear: The Thought confounds me, drives me to Despair. Against myself, against the Youth I rage, Nor can my former Love the Storm assuage. Myrtillo proves the Object of my Scorn; From the loath'd Sight my Eyes with Fury turn: My worst of Wishes does the Swain pursue: My Passion does no Bounds, no Compass know. Thus Love and mortal Hatred in their Turn, Like intermitting Fevers, chill and burn. I, who have sacrific'd a Thousand Swains, Laugh'd at their Love, and slighted all their Pains, Now feel those Fires, which they have undergone, And guess at others Torments by my own. I, who have stood unmov'd at all their Tears, Deaf as the Winds to all their amorous Pray'rs; Have banish'd all their Hopes; with Pride survey'd The Devastation which my Eyes have made; Am now oblig'd my wayward Fate to moan, And a poor simple Shepherd's Conquest own. Corisca, how unhappy hadst thou been, Hadst thou no Lover but Myrtillo seen! What would'st thou do? How sooth thy amorous Pain? Or how revenge the Villain's proud Disdain; To what Extreams may that poor Maid be drove, Whose foolish Heart admits one only Love? Corisca's Soul shall ne'er be so confin'd: She'll love and change as often as the Wind. For what is Faith, or what is constant Love. But idle Dreams which jealous Doatards prove? In vain does silly Man expect to find Or Faith or Constancy in Woman-kind. But if by Chance the Prodigy appears; 'Tisn't th' Effect of Virtue, but of Years. Some ruin'd Beauty, that Love's War gives o'er, Pleas'd with one Captive when she finds no more. Why shines the Sun, but that he may be view'd? What's Beauty if conceal'd, or not pursu'd? Happy's the Nymph whom various Swains adore; Her Triumph's glorious, and her Peace secure. One cannot well all Offices supply, But a long Train of Lovers crown our Joy. This with a matchless Grace his Gifts bestows, That, dances, sings, and the shrill Trumpet blows; A Third reads well; all Plays, and Novels knows. On each the Prudent Nymph confers a Smile, And seems well-pleas'd to see their various Toil. But none shall ever so successful prove, As to transfix my Heart with ardent Love.— And yet, so weak my Resolutions are, Myrtillo sits, alas! in Triumph there. I sigh the live-long Day, yet sigh in vain, I languish, burn, and feel unusual Pain. All Night my Tears like tumbling Surges roll, And thence disclose the Secrets of my Soul.— Unhappy Change! To distant Shades I fly, Yet all in vain,—the Shades Relief deny. In vain I wander thro' the gloomy Grove, And trace the Footsteps of my hated Love. What shall unhappy poor Corisca do?— Corisca cannot,—must not,—will not sue. Shall I forever from his Presence fly? I cannot go;—For if I go,—I die. In these Extreams what Measures are the best, To heal my Griefs, and tune my Soul to Rest? To still this Storm I must approach the Swain, And by Indulgence rouse his Love again. By slow Degrees my Passion must reveal, But the dear Object artfully conceal. What Wiles, what Stratagems can do, I'll try, But if all fail, to sweet Revenge I'll fly? The proud disdainful Youth shall quickly prove My fierce Resentment, if he slights my Love: And my proud Rival, to his Soul so dear, Shall curse the Day she did my Laurels wear. At last, they both shall to their Sorrow know, What Mischief one like me, provok'd can do. A SHORT Epigrammatic Dialogue Between A Passenger and a Turtle-Dove. Written Originally in French. Passenger. Why, pretty Turtle, dost thou mourn Within this shady Grove? Dove. I've lost, alas! my faithful Mate, The Partner of my Love. Passenger. An't you afraid the Fowler's Hand Your Blood, like Her's, should spill? Dove. Oh! no: For, if he kills me not, Incessant Sorrow will.

The Miser and Plutus.The Miser starts, and trembling stares, Wak'd with imaginary Fears. Soon Qualms arise; with anxious Pain He thinks on his ill-gotten Gain. For thee, he cries, accursed Gold, My Honour's lost, my Virtue sold.— Plutus appears.—Why thus abus'd? Thus curst? Thus falsly, Sir, accus'd? “Know, Riches on the Good bestow'd, “Are Blessings worthy of a God. FABLE XVIII. The Lady and the Wasp. As Chloe, with affected Air, Sat lolling in her Easy-Chair, An amorous Wasp around her slew, Perch'd on her Lip, and sipt the Dew. She frowns, she frets.—He makes Reply, With Love I burn, I rage, I die.— She smiles, forgives:—He claps his Wings: But soon she finds that Wasps have Stings.— “Ladies, that are with Coxcombs great, “Mourn their ill Conduct soon or late. FABLE XIX. The Sick-Man and the Angel. Are there no Hopes, the Patient cries? The Doctor turns away, and sighs.— The dying Miser looks aghast; With Shame reviews his Actions past; But thinks his Will may make amends, And on his Pious Gifts depends.— An Angel came and frowning said, Give what thou hast before thou'rt dead.— Why in such haste?—I've made my Will.— Perhaps I may recover still.— “Thou Fool! thy Will! Thy Hopes are vain, “Die and despair.—Thy Heav'n was Gain. FABLE XX. The Shepherd and the Philosopher. Long liv'd the Swain in high Renown For Wisdom, far remote from Town. Say, cry'd an hoary Sage, from whence Thy Judgment and superior Sense? Hast thou with Books familiar been? Or hast thou studied Arts, or Men? With modest Air the Swain reply'd, Nature alone has been my Guide. “Her Laws alone, if well pursu'd, “Will make Men wise, as well as good. FABLE XXI. The Persian, the Sun, and the Cloud. As on the Ground a Persian lay Prostrate before the God of Day, He pray'd.—“Bright Beam, thy Servant bless, “And crown his Labours with Success. With Envy swell'd, an impious Cloud Reprov'd the Man, blasphem'd the God. “Vain fleeting Form! the Persian cry'd, “Thy God adore.—Restrain thy Pride.— “See! with new Beams he gilds the Skies! “Thus Merit shines, and Envy dies. FABLE XXII. The Universal Apparition. As a young Rake repentant sate, Deploring his unhappy Fate, The Phantom Care thus spoke:—“Be wise, “And Health above thy Pleasure prize.— The Youth reforms, resolves to find (His Health restor'd) true Peace of Mind; He seeks the Court, the Camp, the Plain, To fly from Care; but all in vain.— “This World is like a troubled Sea; “No State of Life's from Sorrow free. FABLE XXIII. The Farmer and Jupiter. The Man to Jove did thus apply. O give me Heirs, or else I die!— Three Years roll round.—Two hopeful Boys, And a young Girl, reward his Joys.— Once more he cry'd, approve my Pray'r.— Let them be wealthy, great, and fair.— Jove nods Assent; and soon the first Grows rich, but is with Av'rice curst. The next attains the Height of Place, But falls the Victim of Disgrace. The Girl is blest with sparkling Eyes, But proud, a Virgin lives and dies. When Jove the Father's Grief survey'd, And heard him rail at Heav'n, he said; “Seek Virtue;—and of that possest, “Henceforth to Me resign the rest. FABLE XXIV. The Poet and the Rose. A Poet once, well pleas'd, survey'd A beauteous Rose, and sighing said; To Chloe's whiter Breast repair, Thou'lt find more fragrant Odours there; Her Charms will thine, fair Flow'r, outvie, And thoul't with Envy gaze and die. A Sister Rose soon Silence broke, And frowning, thus the Bard bespoke. Tho' Chloe when you sigh looks gay, And throws you like a Weed away, Why must we languish and decay? “With Justice we the Man despise, “Who by another's Fall would rise. FABLE XXV. The Tame Stag. A Stag caught young, and tamely bred, Bashful at first, each Creature fled; But bolder grown, he dauntless stands, And takes his Food from any Hands; Whene'er repuls'd, with high Disdain, And levell'd Horns, he turns again: So the coy Maid her Lover flies, Or stands at first with down-cast Eyes; But in a while she boasts her Flame: “For Custom conquers Fear and Shame.
