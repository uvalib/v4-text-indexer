R. wisheth you all the happines that euer this worlde can affoorde, with a prosperous returne from your determinate voyage, and honour answerable to your heartes desire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ROBARTES HIS FAREVVEL TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL SYR FRANCES DRAKE KNIGHT, and to his Gentlemen followers, who set sayle at Wolwich to depart towardes their voyage the xv. day of July. 1585. When true report had blased abroad y? iii. yeres tak? toile, Of that rare knight Syr Francis Drake through many a forraine soile. Who by his trauaile on the Seas vnto his endlesse fame, Did purchase for his countrey wealth, and credit to his name, I did expect some Ouids pen to paint his worthy praise, Who when he dies shal stil remaine w? fame on earth alwaies, But none hath writ that earst I sawe which makes me saye, The brunt was spread of trauiles his the Poets did dismay, My minde was forward with y? first, but yet my heart did faile. That gainst my will I forced was to strike my simple sayle. Yet hearing how y? second time this worthy venterous knight. Doeth goe to seas accompanyed with many a worthy wight. My willing heart hath forced my pen thus much to vndertake, To him and to his famous crew, a farewell for to make I doubt not but his noble heart will way of my goodwill, That boldely dares presume thus much y? haue such simple skil. And pardon me his countrey m? who writes for co?treis sake, And for because no one as yet, did euer vndertake To tell vnto all Englishmen what dangers he abode, And eke what co?tryes str?ge he past, while he did rome abroad Yea all the worlde almost Sir Francis Drake hath seene. And welcomes great hath euer had where he on shore hath ben The Heathen Princes honoured him, &amp; fauoures did him giue, And victuals store of such as did their bodyes all relieue. Yea this &amp; many a strange thing els there happened to him th?. When many of his company for feare ran backe againe. And gaue report that dead he was, and sunke in foming flood, Which newes to some right ioyfull was y? wished him no good When such as were his fri?ds indeed w? watry eies did waile. And wisht their blood were shed w? his, so it might him auaile. All this our Poets might haue wrote if they his fame did r?der, Besides the wealth y? he home brought a good cause to rem?ber You might haue taken this smal paines y? same by pen to shew, To make his name w? fame resound &amp; cause the world to know. When many a thousand liued at home and slept w? quiet ease. Great paines abroad our Knight endured w? perils on y? seas. The dangers he hath passed through would make a many muse That keeps their ch?bers close w? shame &amp; hearken after nuse, But l?g may good sir Francis liue which hath enricht our l?d, The like was neuer seene nor heard since Englad first did stad. How like Ulisses did he shewe his policies ech were, And like Achilles bearded his foes &amp; daunted them with feare. The Lord hath blest him noble knight &amp; with his mighty arme Defended him from forren foes that sought to doe him harme. And brought him safely home at last where fauour he did gaine Of our good Queene w? welcomes great &amp; th?ks for tak? pain. That he so nobly had imployed: to nobles all alike case, A wight more welcome then he was came neuer in this place. His credite since hath still increased and God hath so him blest, That he the loue of all hath gaind from best vnto the worst. What should I say but this of him his deedes deserue so well, That of all others which I know Syr Frances beares y? bell. For Bountie, sure he doeth exceede to those that doe deserue, And feeds y? h?gry naked soules which els were like to sterue. And such as in his voyage last to sea with him did goe, And by demeanor ill, hath brought them selues to careful woe. He daily doeth them still relieue and all their family. A mirrour of a worthy minde fraught full of curtesie, O noble Knight what should I say, my pen is to too base, To write thy fame, it rather doth thy worthy deedes disgrace. What wrong hath poets done to thee that learning hath at wil That haue in giuing thee thy due not shewed forth their skill. Who liueth now within the lande that merite doth such fame? Then learned poets giue it Drake that doeth deserue the same. Would God my skill were such thy praise so for to paint, That forren foes to heare thereof w? danted feare should faint. And noble valiant Gentlemen that goeth with him to sea, Although your names I do not know, Ile learn th? as I may. I knowe you goe to purchase fame, and that shall be your hier. And for to shew your valiancie it is your chiefe desire. For dastardes vse at home to stay, and there will sit &amp; talke. When you in many a forren soile in danger daily walke. But nothing can dismay your minds, your noble hearts to trye And idle drones which feare to fight you doe them all defie. Your generall a valiant Knight was neuer daunted yet, But brauely made his foes recoile, wh? face to face they met. Now is your brauery to be shew?, there must you al take pain, Else looke for lasting ignominie when you returne againe. Wel, England hath to few such Knights, y? cares to do so much againe to hazard life and goods, the perill being such. He that doeth knowe the danger past, and venture doth againe. Is worthy haue a crowne of golde to counteruaile his paine. Well since that thou are going hence to take thee to the seas, Forsaking wife and countrey both, thy costly cheare and ease. To God thy voyage Ile commende, to whome I still wil pray. To graunt thee life and safe returne to see that ioyful day. Wherein thou maist behold againe thy louing countreymen, Which wisheth well to thee, &amp; praieth for thy returne againe. Set forwarde noble minde, God send thee winde at will, With coast full cleare and weather faire, thy voyage to fulfill. And shield thee safe from foes, and such as wish you death. Would that I might adu?ture life to reaue th? of their breath. Good Eolus be friendly nowe, and sende a happy gale, That captaine Drake &amp; all his men on seas may safely sale. And God that guides the heauens aboue, so prosper thee w? hap, That al the world haue cause to say, thou liest in fortunes lap. And this farewel x. thousand times the mirrour of our yeeres. Farewel the Phenix of our age, whose acts admittes no peres. Farewel you gallant Gentes, who here might liue at ease. Yet thrust your heads for countries welth in hasard on y? seas. We be no Troians borne gainst wh? durst Iuno iustly skold, Happy be we at your returne, your foes confusion to behold. Thus whilest my t?gue can talke or pen may paint thy praise, I wil set down what dreadles deeds were done w?in thy dayes. Thou Neptune god, if fauour ought might fierce Achilles find, Uouchsafe to sende my countreyman a calmed waue &amp; winde. Thy parting nowe is blased abroad, as euery tongue can tell, Thy ships are lancht, thy sailes are hoist, Syr Francis Drake farewell. H. R. FINIS. Robarts his farewell to the saylers and souldiours appointed for this exploite. And saylors all and mates what euer that you be, which willing are w? this good knight, these exploits for to see Let neuer courage quaile, but shew your selues like men, For good sir Drake is generrall, come shewe your valour then. You heare before what he hath done, when he at sea was last: And eke what knowledge he hath gaind of euery forreine coast. The worthiest pilate in this land that euer I did knowe, Your selues I aske to iudge with me, and many a thousand mo. And how he hath enricht the land, and stored it with gold, And how he did reward his men, my pen can scarse vnfold: And honored them in al their deeds, bicause they did take pain, And frendship euer at his handes their duetie did them gaine. Yea, he dealt with them so bountiful, &amp; gaue th? such large pay, That he for it is worthy praise, they so of him will say. A very lambe vnto his frends, as euery toong can tell, But vnto such that it deserue, he is both fierce and fell, You know the valour of the man is more then I can say, Then feare not harts, but venture on, &amp; please him al you may. Your foreward he himselfe will be as euer he hath beene. In any point of seruice he will venture life and lim. Be valiant then you noble harts, &amp; when you meet your foes, Apply your manhood all you may, for to increase their woes. And in your fighting euermore, thinke you are Englishmen, Then euery one of you I hope, will slay of Spaniards ten: Or any els what ere they be, that shall disturbe your peace, And seeke by any kind of meane your quiet to disease. God and S. Georg you worthy wights, proceed triumphantly, In Princes cause let no one quaile, but all couragious be: The Drum &amp; Fife you warlike wights, shal euer by you stand, As long as any fight indures, for comfort by your hand. Gaine honor then, and hold the same, as long as ere you liue: But if like dastards you do proue, o how your harts may grieue That euer noble wight should trust to such a mate, As eats his vittails with the best, yet feares to shew his pate. Once for to looke his foe in face at any time to see, God shield that any such among this warlike crue should be. Since you are they must honor win, th? trie your force on foes And shew your selues couragiously, apply your english blows. Then valiant harts that seeke for fame, be sure the same to gain For with her trumpe of glitring gold she wil requite your pain. And at your home returne againe, such praise for you ile write, Shall do you good to heare the same your trauell to requite, If you returne, as God I trust will send you all againe,d Your general wil reward you all as you imploy your paine, Be iust therefore and gentle too, ech looke vnto his charge, And see against your generall commit you no outrage. Serue God, obey your gouernor, and him both loue and feare, You are c?manded so my frends, your princes charge you bear. Then God shall blesse you still if you doe liue in awe, If you offend he punish may by vertue of his lawe. Therefore agree in vnitie, and loue one with the other, And ioine your selues in amitie, as brother with his brother. For in this cause you are as one, though many soules you be, Then fellowe mates looke to your selues, and neuer disagree. For whereas brawles be set abroch, and quarrellers remaine, It greatly will your general grieue, &amp; vexe his hart with paine. To see that men which ought be wise so giuen vnto will, And in a harebraine humor seeke ech other for to kill. My louing frends and countrymen, let these my words auaile, And thinke vpon these simple lines, when ship is vnder saile. Thus vnto God I you commend, to whom I still will pray, To send you safe among your frends, and shield you on the sea. I meane you all good will, I trust you take it so, Then farewell english harts, God keepe you all from wo. And send you short and safe returne to english coast againe, That you may sit and talke at home of all your passed paine. Aboard my mates, your warning peace is shot, the hoise up saile, God send you all safe home again that toile for common weale.</field>
