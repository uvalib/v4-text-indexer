      <field name="fulltext">NEPENTHE Canto I Over a bloomy land untrod By heavier foot than bird or bee Lays on the grassy-bosomed sod, I passed one day in reverie. High on his unpavilioned throne The heaven's hot tyrant sat alone, And like the fabled king of old Was turning all he touched to gold. The glittering fountains seemed to pour Steep downward rills of molten ore, Glassily tinkling smooth between Broom-shaded banks of golden green, And o'er the yellow pasture straying Dallying still yet undelaying, In hasty trips from side to side Footing adown their steepy slide Headlong, impetuously playing With the flowery border pied, That edged the rocky mountain stair, They pattered down incessant there, To lowlands sweet and calm and wide. With golden lip and glistening bell Burned every bee-cup on the fell, Whate'er its native unsunned hue, Snow-white or crimson or cold blue; Even the black lustres of the sloe Glanced as they sided to the glow; And furze in russet frock arrayed With saffron knots, like shepherd maid, Broadly tricked out her rough brocade. The singed mosses curling here, A golden fleece too short to shear! Crumbled to sparkling dust beneath My light step on that sunny heath. Light, for the ardour of the clime Made rare my spirit, that sublime Bore me as buoyant as young Time Over the green Earth's grassy prime, Ere his slouch'd wing caught up her slime; And sprang I not from clay and crime, Had from those humming beds of thyme Lifted me near the starry chime To learn an empyrean rhyme. No melody beneath the moon Sweeter than this deep runnel tune! Here on the greensward grown hot gray, Crisp as the unshorn desert hay, Where his moist pipe the dulcet rill For humorous grasshopper doth fill, That spits himself from blade to blade By long o'er-rest uneasy made, Here, ere the stream by fountain pushes Lose himself brightly in the rushes With butterfly path among the bushes, I'll lay me, on these mosses brown, Murmuring beside his murmurs down, And from the liquid tale he tells Glean out some broken syllables, Or close mine eyes in dreamy swoon, As by hoarse-winding deep Gihoon Soothes with the hum his idle pain The melancholy Tartar swain, Sole mark on that huge-meadowed plain! Hie on to great Ocean! hie on! hie on! Fleet as water can gallop, hie on! Hear ye not thro' the ground How the sea-trumpets sound Round the sea-monarch's shallop, hie on! Hie on to brave Ocean! hie on! hie on! From the sleek mountain levels, hie on! Hear ye not in the boom Of the water-bell's womb Pleasant whoop to sea-revels, hie on! Hie on to bright Ocean! hie on! hie on! 'Tis the store of rich waters, hie on! Hear ye not the rough sands Rolling gold on the strands For poor Earth's sons and daughters, hie on! Hie on to calm Ocean! hie on! hie on! Summer-rest from earth riot, hie on! Hear ye not the smooth tide With deep murmur and wide Call ye down to its quiet, hie on! Thus to the babbling streamlet elves To haste them down the slopes and shelves, Methought some Naiad of their fall In her bright-dropping sparry hall Sang to her glassy virginal.â Perchance to me monition sweet! I started upright to my feet Attent: 'twas but a fancy dream! I only heard in measure meet The pulses of the fountain beat, As onward prest the throbbing stream. Fair fall no less my fancy dream! I have been still led like a child My heedless, wayward path and wild Thro' this rough world by feebler clues, So they were bright, than rainbow dews Spun by the insect gossamer To climb with thro' the ropy air. Fair fall ye then, my fancy dream! I'll with this labyrinthian stream, Where'er it flow, where'er it cease, There be my pathway and my peace! Swift as a star falls thro' the night, Swift as a sunshot dart of light, Down from the hill's heaven-touching height The streamlet vanished from my sight! I crept me to a promontory Where it had fallen from earth's top story, And peering over, saw its flow, A cataract white of smoke and snow, Looping in fleecy shawls below; Frail footing on such shrouds as these! Elves may descend them if they please; But here, by help of bushy stem That plumes the hill's huge diadem, By hoar rock, its gigantic gem Far glancing o'er the prostrate seas, Into the vale that spreads to them Lark-like I'll drop by glad degrees. Shrill on those lofty-sloping leas The wind-bells sounded in the breeze, Dingling beside me, as I glid, So sweet, I scarce knew what I did; But shrilly, too, as that lithe shell Blown from old Ocean's world-broad well, When the red hour of morn's begun And Zephyr posts before the Sun. Yet shriller still than rings at morn The wet-mouthed wind-god's broadening horn, Sudden above my head I heard The cliff-scream of the thunder-bird, The rushing of his forest wings, A hurricane when he swoops or springs, And saw upon the darkening glade Cloud-broad his sun-eclipsing shade. With the shrill clang that cleft the skies When he flew Joveward with his prize, The golden-haired Dardanian boy, With such rude burst of robber joy, Rose the sun-scorner; from earth's shore My boy-weight like a worm he bore Methought to heaven's embowed floor; My brain turnedâI could see no more! O blest unfabled Incense Tree, That burns in glorious Araby, With red scent chalicing the air, Till earth-life grow Elysian there! Half buried to her flaming breast In this bright tree, she makes her nest, Hundred-sunned PhÅnix! when she must Crumble at length to hoary dust! Her gorgeous death-bed! her rich pyre Burnt up with aromatic fire! Her urn, sight high from spoiler men! Her birthplace when self-born again! The mountainless green wilds among, Here ends she her unechoing song! With amber tears and odorous sighs Mourned by the desert where she dies! Laid like the young fawn mossily In sun-green vales of Araby, I woke, hard by the PhÅnix tree That with shadeless boughs flamed over me, And upward called by a dumb cry With moonbroad orbs of wonder, I Beheld the immortal Bird on high Glassing the great sun in her eye. Stedfast she gazed upon his fire, Still her destroyer and her sire! As if to his her soul of flame Had flown already, whence it came; Like those that sit and glare so still, Intense with their death struggle, till We touch, and curdle at their chill!â But breathing yet while she doth burn The deathless Daughter of the sun! Slowly to crimson embers turn The beauties of the brightsome one. O'er the broad nest her silver wings Shook down their wasteful glitterings; Her brinded neck high-arched in air Like a small rainbow faded there; But brighter glowed her plumy crown Mouldering to golden ashes down; With fume of sweet woods, to the skies, Pure as a Saint's adoring sighs, Warm as a prayer in Paradise, Her life-breath rose in sacrifice! The while with shrill triumphant tone Sounding aloud, aloft, alone, Ceaseless her joyful deathwail she Sang to departing Araby! Deep melancholy wonder drew Tears from my heartspring at that view. Like cresset shedding its last flare Upon some wistful mariner, The Bird, fast blending with the sky, Turned on me her dead-gazing eye Onceâand as surge to shallow spray Sank down to vapoury dust away! O, fast her amber blood doth flow From the heart-wounded Incense Tree, Fast as earth's deep-embosomed woe In silent rivulets to the sea! Beauty may weep her fair first-born, Perchance in as resplendent tears, Such golden dewdrops bow the corn When the stern sickleman appears. But oh! such perfume to a bower Never allured sweet-seeking bee, As to sip fast that nectarous shower A thirstier minstrel drew in me! My burning soul one drop did quaffâ Heaven reeled and gave a thunder-laugh! Earth reeled, as if with pendulous swing She rose each side through half her ring, That I, head downward, twice uphurled, Saw twice the deep blue underworld, Twice, at one glance, beneath me lie The bottomless, boundless, void sky! Tho' inland far, me seemed around Ocean came on with swallowing sound Like moving mountains serried high! Methought a thousand daystars burned By their mere fury as they turned, Bewildering heaven with too much bright, Till day looked like a daylight night. Brief chaos, only of the brain! Heaven settled on its poles again, And all stood still, but dizzily. Light-trooping o'er the distant lea A band I saw, where Revelry Seemed on her bacchant foot to be, And heard the dry tambour afar Before her Corybantian car Booming the rout to winy war. Forward I felt my spirit chime Awhoop with this hot-raging rhyme, That, breathed up by the feverish crew While back their MÃ¦nad locks they threw, O'er them imbrowned the welkin blue. Ambition mad, when most sublime! Fain had I clomb Heaven's empery, Fain would my Titan spirit climb Mountain-topt mountain arduously, To whoop the far uproar to me! Such insane power and subtilty The magic drop ethereal gave, Tireless I clomb that palmy tree And saw broad-landed Earth how brave! Low on the horizontal lee I saw, bedreamed, far ocean dumb Upgathering his white skirts to come Midland; his arms twixt Araby And Europe, Afric, India, spread I saw; the Mediterraneans three, Azure, and orient grey, and red, Washing at once the earth and sky; With the untravelled wastes that lie Of greenest ocean, where the South Swills it with demogorgon drouth, Disgorging amid foam and roar His salt draught back to every shore. Mute as I gaze my feet below, By times the silvery ashes glow Under me, where the Bird of Fire In her own flames seemed to expire, Chanting her odorous monody; Methought in each faint glow, again I saw her last dim glance at me Languid with hope akin to pain. âHow, if the juice with ether rife, Elixir of superfluous life, Instinct with spiritual flame Which from yon still of splendour came, Might prove more quick restorative Of her, than Hippocrat could give!â So thought I, and with fancy fired Did what the draught itself inspired: I sprinkled on the embers white Few drops; they curdleâcloseâunite, Each with his orb of atomies, Till in firm corporation these Leaguing again by law occult, Shapening and shapening by degrees, Develop fair the full result; And like the sun in giant mould, Cast of unnumbered stars, behold The PhÅnix with her crest of gold, Her silver wings, her starry eyes, The PhÅnix from her ashes rise! Now was the wherefore easy scanned, She bore me from my bloomy land, Threw on me her last filmed look; Smouldering aidless in her nook Years had departed ere she grew By sun and starlight bird anew; But their full essence poured in flame, Distilment sweet! Nepenthe true! (By nature panacÃ©e sure, and name!) Poured on her dust-dismembered frame, PhÅnix at once to heaven she flew! Over hills and uplands high Hurry me, Nymphs! O, hurry me! Where green Earth from azure sky Seems but one blue step to be; Where the sun his wheel of gold Burnishes deeply in her mould, And her shining walks uneven Seem declivities of Heaven. Come! where high Olympus nods, Groundsill to the hall of gods! Let us through the breathless air Soar insuperable, where Audibly in mystic ring The angel orbs are heard to sing; And from that bright vantage ground Viewing nether heaven profound, Mark the eagle near the sun Scorching to gold his pinions dun; With fleecy birds of paradise Upfloating to their native skies; Or hear the wild swans far below Faintly whistle as they row Their course on the transparent tide That fills the hollow welkin wide! Hurry me, Nymphs! O, hurry me Far above the grovelling sea, Which, with blind weakness and base roar Casting his white age on the shore, Wallows along that slimy floor; With his widespread webbed hands Seeking to climb the level sands, But rejected still to rave Alive in his uncovered grave. Light-skirt dancers, blithe and boon With high hosen and low shoon, 'Twixt sandal bordure and kirtle rim Showing one pure wave of limb, And frequent to the cestus fine Lavish beauty's undulous line, Till like roses veiled in snow Neath the gauze your blushes glow; Nymphs, with tresses which the wind Sleekly tosses to its mind, More deliriously dishevelled Than when the Naxian widow revelled With her flush bridegroom on the ooze, Hurry me, Sisters! where ye choose, Up the meadowy mountains wild, Aye by the broad sun oversmiled, Up the rocky paths of gray Shaded all my hawthorn way, Past the very turban crown Feathered with pine and aspen spray, Darkening like a soldan's down O'er the mute stoopers to his sway, Meek willows, daisies, brambles brown, Grasses and reeds in green array, Sighing what he in storm doth sayâ Hurry me, hurry me, Nymphs, away! Here on the mountain's sunburnt side Trip we round our steepy slide, With tinsel moss, dry-woven pall, Minist'ring many a frolic fall; Now, sweet Nymphs, with ankle trim Foot we around this fountain brim, Where even the delicate lilies show Trangressing bosoms in bright row (More lustrous-sweet than yours, I trow!) Above their deep green boddices. Shall you be charier still than these? Garments are only good to inspire Warmer, wantoner desire; For those beauties make more riot In our hearts, themselves at quiet Under veils and vapoury lawns Thro' which their moon-cold lustre dawns, And might perchance if full revealed Seem less wondrous than concealed, Greater defeat of Virtue made When Love shoots from an ambuscade, Than with naked front and fair. Who the loose Grace in flowing hair Hath ever sought with so much care, As the crape-enshrouded nun Scarce warmed by touches of the sun? Nathless, whatsoe'er your tire, Hurry me, sweet Nymphs, higher, higher! Till the broad seas shrink to streams, Or, beneath my lofty eye, Ocean a broken mirror seems, Whose fragments 'tween the lands do lie, Glancing me from its hollow sky Till my cheated vision deems My place in heaven twice as high! Ho! Evoe! I have found True Nepenthe, balm of pain, Sought by sagest wits profound, Mystic PanacÃ©e! in vain. Virtuous Elixir, this Sure the supreme sense of bliss! Feeling my impetuous soul Ravish me swifter than Earth's roll Tow'rds bright day's Eoan goal; Or if West I chose to run, Would sweep me thither before the sun, Raising me on ethereal wing Lighter than the lark can spring When drunk with dewlight which the Morn Pours from her translucent horn To steep his sweet throat in the corn. Still, O still my step sublime Footless air would higher climb, Like the Chaldee Hunter bold, Builder of towery Babel old! O what sweeter, finer pleasure Than this wild, unruly measure, Reeling hither, thither, so Higher to the heavens we go! Nymph and swain, with rosy hand, Wreathed together in a band, Like embracing vines that loop Browner elms with tendril hoop, Let us, liker still to these In rich autumn's purple weather, Mix, as the vineyard in the breeze, Our wine-dropping brows together! Swinging on our feet around Till our tresses touch the ground, That mad moment we do stay To meditate our whirl-away! Winds that, blown off the honied heath, Warm the deep reeds with mellowing breath, Shall for us, Ãolian still, These green flutes of Nature fill; On bluebell beds like dulcimers Tingle us most fantastic airs; And where'er her numerous strings Woodbine like a wind-harp swings, Play us light fugues with nimble wings, Trumpeting thro' each twisted shell Till its mossy wrinkles swell. Such shall, with sweet voluntaries, Blithe accompaniment bear us, Not without help of that dim band, Minstrels of each woody land, Piping unhired on every hand; These shall be our volatile chorus, Fleeting the wilderness before us, Like their small brethren of the chant, Drone-winders itinerant, Old-world humming birds, the bees, Our sweet whifflers shall be these! While our oval close within Capering faun keeps mellow din, With pipe and ceaseless cittern thrum, Tinkling tabor's shallow drum, Cymbal and lengthening cornmuse hum. Uproar sweet! as when he crost, Omnipotent Bacchus, with his host, To farthest Ind; and for his van Satyrs and other sons of Pan, With swoln eye-burying cheeks of tan, Who trolled him round which way he ran His spotted yoke through Hindostan, And with most victorious scorn The mild foes of wine to warn, Blew his dithyrambic horn! That each river to his source Trembledâand sunk beneath his course, Where, 'tis said of many, they Mourn undiscovered to this day. Still my thoughts, mine eyes aspire! Hurry me, sweet Nymphs, higher and higher! Smooth green hills my soul do tire; Let us leave this lowly shire, Tho' it be the Happy Clime, 'Tis for spirits less sublime! Fleet we sheer as lightning-blast Pinnacled Petrea past, Burning rocks bestrown with sands! O'er the bleak Deserta lands Pass we, as o'er dead Nature's tomb, Where Sirocco and Simoom Battle with hot breath for room, Tho' not even a flower or cress Make war-worth that wilderness; From this wavering blown arene To where the Rome-repelling queen, High-stomach'd, star-bound Emperess! Long beruled broad Palmyrene, Let's begone; and farther still, Here, too, naught but sandblown hill, Only another ocean bed Tossed by billowy winds instead Of the old legitimate breakers, Dust-disturbers, not earth-shakers! From these deep abysses dry, Filled with sunlight to the sky, Let us, O let us swift begone To the cedared Lebanon; Over Carmel's flowery sides Where the wild-bee ever bides, Round each beauty of the glade Singing his noontide serenade, Till the ear-enchanted fair, Opening her leafy stomacher, Lets in the little ravisher. On to shadowy Taurus, on! Looming o'er the Syrian wave, Scarce a flower his sides upon, Swoln with many an antique grave Of slaughtered Persepolitan, Rare Greek and Macedonian. Lowly shelter for the slain Still his rueful heaths remain, That purpler tinged with buried blood Darken deeper the green flood, And, a blushing chronicle, The tale of fallen glory tell, Persia's dumb echoes know so well! Thou whose thrilling hand in mine Makes it tremble as unbid, Whose dove-drooping eyes divine Curtain Love beneath their lid; Fairest Anthea! thou whose grace Leads me enchantedly along Till the sweet windings that we trace Seem like the image of a song! Blithest Anthea! thou I ween Of this jocund choir the queen, From thy beauty still more rare, And a more earth-spurning air, If forsooth my reeling vision Hold thee steadily, and this Be not my mind's insane misprision, Drunk with the essence-drop of bliss! Small matter!âwhile the dream be bright! Surely thou with form so light Must be some creature born for winging Where the chimes of Heaven are ringing, And sweet cherub faces singing Requiems to ascending souls Where each orb of glory rolls! Bind me, oh bind me next thy heart, So shall we to the skies depart, And like a twin-star fixt in ether, Burn with immortal flame together! That be our emprised rest, Eyry where birds of Eden nest, Warbling hymns in Wonder's ear! We still walk this lowly sphere, Lost in the heaven's crystalline mere More than in ocean one small tear. Wherefore, without vain delay, Haste, Anthea! haste away To those highest peaks the sun Steps with glittering sandal on, That this bosom-fire as fast As his, breathe forth in the clear vast! Bright-haired Spirit! Golden Brow! Onward to far Ida now! Leaving these garden lands below In sea-born dews to steep their glow: Caria and Lycia, dulcet climes! Beds of flowers whose odour limes The o'erflying fast far bird, their thrall Hovering entranced till he fall; Broad MÃ¦onia's streamy vales Winding beneath us, white with swans Borne by their downy-swelling sails; Each her lucid beauty scans, Bending her slow beak round, and sees Her grandeur as she floats along Gracefully ruffled by the breeze, And troats for joy, too proud for song. Leave we the downlands, tho' be there Joy a lifelong sojourner; There for ever wildwood numbers Poured in Doric strains dilute Thro' the unlaborious flute, Soothe Disquiet to his slumbers; In his rosebed sleeps the bee, Lulled by Lydian melody, Half the honied morn in vain! Idler still the Doric swain, Steeped in double sweetness he Hums, as he dreams, his wildwood strain. The Mysian vineplucker sings i' the tree, And Ionia's echoing train Of reapers, bending down the lea, Make rich the winds with minstrelsy. Here, no less, if any linger, Pointing us down with abject finger, Or stop with but a sigh to praise The slothful fields on which we gaze More time than serves him to renew His buoyant draughts of ether blue, Or (if the wine-sweat pouring through With beaded reek his brows embrue) Shake from his curls the shining dewâ Down with the grovelling caitiff, down! Scourge him with your green thyrses down! While as a thundercloud on high Bursting its blackness o'er him, I Envelop him in my blazing scorn Of dread pride and bright anger born! Here is meet repose for none That climb Earth's mountain-studded zone! Here the Great Mother smoothes again Her broad skirts to the broader main! Even Ãolia's lofty steep Shelves to the tributary deep, And her level winds do play His watery organ far away To the hoarse Thermaic strand; Sleek as the tremulous lady moon From her bright horizon chair, Tipping his silver keys in tune With long low arm and beamy hand She stretches all enjewelled there. Ida!âilloo! behold! behold Ida, the Queen of the Hills of old, Rising with sundropt crown of gold! Alone great Ida from the shore Lifts high above its silent roar Her caverns, and with those rude ears Only the haughty thunder hears! All hail, green-mantled Ida! Floodgate of heaven-fall'n streams! Replenisher of wasteful ocean's store! Sweetener of his salt effluence! Ever-pure! Battener of meagre Earth! Bestower Of their moist breath to vegetable things That suck their life from thee!â All hail!â All hail, green Ida!â Woody-belted ida!â Nurse of the bounding lion! his green lair, Whence he doth shake afar The shepherdry with his roar! All hail, Peaks where the wild ass flings His Pegasean heels against mankind, And the more riotous mares, Pawing at heaven, snuff the womb-swelling wind! Ida, all hail! all hail! Nature's green, ever-during pyramid Heaped o'er the behemoth brute-royal bones Of monstrous Anakim! All hail, great Ida! throne Of that old Jove the olden poet sung Where, from the Gods alone, He listened to the moan Of his divine Sarpedon, thousand moans among!â Ida, all hail! all hail! Thus on thy pinnacle, With springy foot like the wild swan that soars Off to invisible shores, I stand! with blind Ambition's waxen wings High o'er my head Outspread, Plucking me off the Earth to wheel aerial rings! Lo! as my vision glides Adown these perilous flowery sides, Green hanging-gardens only trod By Nymph or Sylvan God, And sees o'er what a gulf their eminent glory swells, I tremble with delight, Proud of my terrible plight, And turn me to the hollow caves Where the hoarse spirit of the Euxine raves. The melancholy tale of that drown'd Youth he tells To the fast fleeting waves, For ever in vast murmurs, as he laves With foam his sedgy locks loose-floating down the Dardanelles! Down the Dardanelles! What Echo in musical sound repels My words, like thunder tolled From the high-toppling rocks In loud redoublous shocks Behold, great Sun, behold! Down the Dardanelles! Behold the Thunderer where she rides! Behold her how she swells Like floating clouds her canvas sides! Raising with ponderous breast the tides On both the shores, as down she rides, Down the Dardanelles! Down the Dardanelles! Each Continent like a caitiff stands, As every broadside knells! While with a voice that shakes the strands She spreads her hundred-mouth'd commands, Albion's loud law to both the lands, Down the Dardanelles! Down the Dardanelles! Ye billowy hills before her bowne! Wind caverns! your deep shells Ring Ocean and Earth her old renown Long as that sun from Ida's crown Smoothes her broad road with splendour down, Down the Dardanelles! Anthea, ever dear, I feel, I feel the sharp satyric ear Thy draught Circean gave me, echoing clear With that far chime! Capacious grown enough to hear The music of the lower sphere, Tho' fainter than the passing tread of stealthy-footed Time! Be mute, ye summer airs around! Let not a sigh disturb the sound That like a shadow climbs the steepy ground Up from blue Helle's dim profound! Listen! the roar Creeps on the ear as on a little shore, And by degrees Swells like the rushing sound of many seas, And now as loud upon the brain doth beat As Helle's tide in thunderbursts broke foaming at my feet! Hist! ho!âthe Spirit sings While in the cradle of the surge he swings, Or falling down its sheeted laps, Speaks to it in thunder-claps Terrifical, half-suffocated things! For ever with his furious breath Keeping a watery storm beneath Where'er he sinks, that o'er him seethe The frothy salt-sea surfaces Dissolving with an icy hiss, As if the marvellous flood did flow Over a quenchless fire below! Hist! ho! the Spirit sings! In the caves of the deepâlost Youth! lost Youth!â O'er and o'er, fleeting billows! fleeting billows!â Rung to his restless everlasting sleep By the heavy death-bells of the deep, Under the slimy-dropping sea-green willows, Poor Youth! lost Youth! Laying his dolorous head, forsooth, On Carian reefs uncouthâ Poor Youth!â On the wild sand's ever-shifting pillows! In the foam's cold shroudâlost Youth! lost Youth!â And the lithe waterweed swathing round him!â Mocked by the surges roaring o'er him loud, âWill the sun-seeker freeze in his shroud, Aye, where the deep-wheeling eddy has wound him?â Lost Youth! poor Youth! Vail him his DÃ¦dalian wings, in truth? Stretched there without all ruthâ Poor Youth!â Weeping fresh torrents into those that drowned him! List no more the ominous din, Let us plunge deep Helle in! Thracia hollos!âwhat to us Sky-dejected Icarus? Shall we less than those wild kine That swam this shallow salt confine, Venture to shew how mere a span Keeps continental man from man? Welcome, gray Europe, native clime Of clouds, and cliffs yet more sublime! Gray Europe, on whose Alpine head The Northwind makes his snowy bed, And fostered in that savage form Lies down a blast and wakes a storm! Up! up! to shrouded Rhodope That seems in the white waste to be An icerock in a foaming sea! This inward rage, this eating flame, Turns into fiery dust my frame; Thro' my red nostril and my teeth In sulphury fumes I seem to breathe My dragon soul, and fain would quench This drouth in some o'erwhelming drench! Up! to the frostbound waterfalls, That hang in waves the mountain walls, Down tumbling ever and anon With long-pent thunders loosed in one, Thro' the deep valleys where of yore The Deluge his wide channels wore. Hark! thro' each green and gateless door, Valley to echoing valley calls Me, steep up, higher to the sun! Hark! while we stand in mute astound, Cloud-battled high PangÃ¦us hoar With earthquake voice and ocean roar Keeps the pale region trembling round! Upward! each loftier height we gain, I spurn it like the basest plain Trod by the fallen in hell's profound! Illoo, great HÃ¦mus! HÃ¦mus old, Half earth into his girdle rolled, Swells against heaven!âUp! up! the stars Wheel near his goal their glittering cars; Ambition's mounting-step sublime To vault beyond the sphere of Time Into Eternity's bright clime! Where this fierce joy I feel, shall aye subside, Like a swoln bubble on the ocean tide, Into the River of Bliss, Elysium-wide; And all annoy Lie drowned with it for ever there, And never-ebbing Life's soft stream with confluent wave My floating spirit bear Among those calm Beatitudes and fair, That lave Their angel forms, with pure luxuriance free, In thy rich ooze and amber-molten sea, Slow-flooding to the one deep choral staveâ Eterne Tranquillity! All-blessing, blest, eterne Tranquillity! Strymon, heaven-descended stream! Valley along, thy silver sand Broader and broader yet doth gleam, Spreading into ocean's strand, Over whose white verge the storm With his wide-swaying loomy arm Weaves his mournful tapestry, Slowly let down from sky to sea. Strymon! up thy craggy banks Mid the pinewood's wavering ranks, What terrible howl ascends? What blaze Of torches blackening the coil'd haze With grim contrast of smoky rays? What hideous features mid the flare, Lit with yellow laughter? Where, Ah! where my boon Circean band Quiring round me hand in hand?â Furies, avaunt! that dismal joy Breeds me horrible annoy! Avaunt, she-wolves! with rabid yell Riving the very seams of hell To swallow me and your rout as well! Flee, flee, my wretched soul, from these Erinnys and Eumenides, Bacchants no more, but raging brood Of fiends to feast them on hot blood!â Down! down! and shelter me in the flood! âHollo after!âto living shreds tear him!âhollo after! To the ravenous wild winds share him!âhollo after! Our rite he spurns, From our love he turns, Hurl him the glassy crags down! hollo after! With your torches blast him, To the broken waves cast him, Head and trunk far asunder! With a bellow like thunder, Hollo after! hollo after! hollo after!â Dull in the Drowner's ear Bubbled amid far ocean these sad echoes drear. In the caves of the deepâHollo! hollo!â Lost Youth!âo'er and o'er fleeting billows! Hollo! hollo!âwithout all ruth!â In the foam's cold shroud!âHollo! hollo! To his everlasting sleep!âLost Youth! Canto II Antiquity, thou Titan-born! That rear'st thee, in stupendous scorn At all succession. from thy bed On prime earth's firm foundations spread, And look'st with dim but settled eye O'er thy deep lap, within whose span Layer upon layer sepulchred lie Whole generations of frail man! That steady glare not fierce Simoom, Blasting with his hot pinion blinds, Nor floods of dust thy corse entomb, Heaped o'er thee by the sexton winds! Nor temple, tower, nor ponderous town Built on thy grave can keep thee down, But still thou rear'st thee in thy scorn, Antiquity, thou Titan-born, To crush our souls with that dim frown! Strong Son of Chaos! who didst seem Only a fairer form of him, Moulding his mountainous profounds To fanes and monumental grounds; His rocky coigns, with giant ease, In pyramids and palaces Piling aslope, as we with pain His ruinous rubbish raised in vain! Thou that with Tubal old compeer, In living cliffs didst statue man And carve, for toys, leviathan Or mammoth, yet found bedded here His stony limbs, where once he stood Scarce moved a footpace by the Flood! Still at thy works in mute amaze, Sorrow and envy and awe we gaze! Enlarge our little eyeballs still To grasp in these degenerate days Marvels that shewed a mighty will, Huge power and hundred-handed skill, That seek prostration and not praise Too faint such lofty ears to fill! From Ind to Egypt thou art one, Pyramidal Memphis to Tanjore, From Ipsambul to Babylon Reddening the waste suburban o'er; From sand-locked Thebes to old Ellore, Her caverned roof on columns high Pitched, like a Giant brood that bore Headstrong the mountain to the sky: That one same Power, enorm, sublime Thou art, from antique clime to clime, Eternal stumbling-block of Time! Whose fragmentary limbs do stay, Stones of offence, his difficult way, And turn it o'er our works of clay. Lo! where thy strength colossal lay Dormant, within the deep-sunk halls Of cities labyrinthian Mid sandy Afric and the walls Of sunburnt Syria or Deccan, Up from the bilging globe he calls Seas to surprise thee, or enthralls Earth to deluginous ocean, So far he may; with foamy van Whelming her shores where thou bedreamed Heard'st not the tide that o'er thee teemed Mountains of water! Aye in vain! O'ersailing vessels see below Clear, thro' the glass-green undulous plain, Like emerald cliffs unmoved glow Thy towering forms stretched far a-main By Coromandel, or that side Neptunian Ganges rolls the tide Of his swoln sire; by Moab's lake Whose purulent flood dry land doth slake With bittern ooze, where that salt wife Drinks her own tears she weeps as rife, Empillared there, as when she turned Back tow'rds her liquorish late-spent life Where Shame's sulphureous cities burned: By Dorian Sicily and Misene, Upon whose strand thou oft didst lean Thy temple-crowned head; and where Antium with opposite Carthage were; By green Juvernia's giant road Paved from her headland slope and broad Sands down to Rachlin's columned isle, And dim Finn Gael's huge-antred pile Where his vast orgue, high fluted, stands Basaltic, swept with billowy hands Oft, till the mystic chancel mourn To weltering biers around it borne Hoarse ritual o'er the wrecked forlorn; There did the scythed Demon hew Sheer the Cyclopian causeway through, Letting the steep Icelandic sea In on the Ibernian and on Thee! So from their icy moorings he, Lopt cable, loosed the Arctic isles Full sail, with mountainous weigh and prore To force that boom of seadriven piles, Bulwark against the Northern bore Of Ocean, laid by thee, and now Chaining the Strait, as long before, Tho' scattered on the Southern bow Kamchatka's sparry waters o'erâ What need for thy great relics plough Tartaria sands, or seek that scroll Which the rapt Bonze can scarce unroll, Thy chronicle, in pagodas dim, Lengthening it wave and wave a-flow Incessant, as from darkness' brim Wells forth Cathaian Hoan-ho? What need thy famous works be told I' the New World, older than the Old, If sooth the Mexique annals say With Eve's first born, Tradition gray, And monuments more fixed than theyâ Pyramids baked in Noah's sun, Dials and monstrous Gods, far back Out-dating Denderah's Zodiac, Crocodilopolis and Karnak; With scrolls of pictured speech begun Ere smoother hieroglyph could run, Slight copy of that primeval one? What need the wondrous town untomb, Palenque, aye too old for Fame To tell her antediluvian name Or fate; perchance, at her own door, Crept back into Creation's womb, Tired of endurance, thro' the chasm Oped in Earth's side with mighty spasm When Orinook burst forth, and down From Chimborazo's streamy crown Rolled oceanic Maranon, Contributing fresh seas to seas; Huge chasm! with Andes' ponderous chain Locked to Eternity again, The gulf of All as well as these. Passing thy pierless bridges swung Gorge over, darkening every dell, With keystone rocks colossal hung Like Sin's broad way from heaven to hell, Sloping aloft with cliffy sides, Thro' the burnt air the porchway rides; Demoniac shapes, devices grim, Trenching the storied panels dim, And mystic signs, dark oracles Of Destiny, and Hell's decrees!â Alas! what scalding sand-wind rolls Me to the sulphury rack of souls Fierce on, and scarfs my victim eyes With careless wreaths for sacrifice? Thus weep I, whirlwind-rapt amain: Save me! O save, ye mighty Twain, Arbiters here twixt Sin and Pain! Tho' Angels still of Judgment, be Angels of Mercy now to me! Bend down your level looks, or raise One iron finger from the knee, So Cherubin Pities sing your praise!â Thus to a Twain that reared their forms Like promontories o'er the storms, Methought, dread Umpires of my doom, Sitting impalled within the gloom As ebon Seraphim by Night's throne, Low at their feet I made my moan. They stirred not at my prayer; but dumb, Sate like the symbols of the world to come, Immutable, inscrutable! I lay Drowned in my heart-blood, wept away Fruitlessly at those feet, long time, Like the dust-clung, outcast corse of Crime. A sigh that seemed to come from heaven By some aerial Sorrow given, Weeping his sublunar stateâa sighâ One faint far sound, like a swan's cry Heard thro' the daffodils ere it die, O'ercame my senses; a sweet wail Soothing me with its violet gale To gentlest mood. I lookedâand lo! Sweet as Love's star a crest did glow On that now visible head I deemed One of my Arbiter's. Fair it beamed With soft dilation, mellowing still The heav'n-fall'n gem its saffron fire, Crowning the radiant front until Godlike and glorified entire: The while, as there essayed his skill Light-handed Zephyr o'er a lyre With the bright hair strung like golden wire, Dulcetly did the sunbeams thrill Within that coronal attire, Hailing the dawn! And at such hail Behold a-peak the Orient dale, Morning, with light-blown silver veil, Stands dewy-eyed, and matron-pale; Breathing in smiles and tears upon This sacred head her blessings dear, As erst she did, each daylight peer, Sad for her monumental Son. O unchanged world! 'Twas Memnon here Sat gazing with a mournful cheer Still at his mother! Still with smile Fond as her own would fain beguile Her sorrow! Still each matin rise Welcomed her bright tears with his sighs! Most strange! most true! for I anon Heard the famed chant heard long agone By storiers sage, ascend the skies From his Ãolian barbiton; Soft parleying like the voice of rills With Echo in the distant hills, But versing words more liquid clear Than those could, to a thirstier ear. Thus, with a breezy rise and fall, rang the Memnonian rhyme, Like the sweet-mouthed bells of heaven, wild but in one same chime. Winds of the West, arise! Hesperian balmiest airs, O waft back those sweet sighs To her that breathes them from her own pure skies, Dew-dropping, mixt with dawn's engoldened dyes, O'er my unhappy eyes! From primrose bed and willow bank, where your moss cradle lies, O from your rushy bowers, to waft back her sweet sighs, Winds of the West, arise! Over the ocean blown, Far-winnowing, let my soul be mingled with her own, By sighs responsive to each other known! Bird unto bird's loved breast has often flown From distant zone to zone; Why must the Darling of the Morn lament him here alone? Shall not his fleeting spirit be mingled with her own, Over the ocean blown? From your aerial bourne Look down, O Mother, and hear your hapless Memnon mourn! Spectre of my gone self, by sorrow worn, Leave me not, Mother beloved! from your embraces torn, For ever here forlorn! For ever, ever lonely here! of all life's glory shorn! Look down, O Mother! behold your hapless Memnon mourn, From your aerial bourne! The sweet Voice swooned, deep-thrilling; then Raised its wild monody once more As the far murmuring of the main Heard in a sea-shell's fairy shore, Scarce sensible, made one with pain, Wind-lost and fitfuller than before; Yet still methought the mystic strain Burden like this bewildered bore. O could my Spirit wing Hills over, where salt Ocean hath his fresh headspring And snowy curls bedeck the Blue-haired King, Up where sweet oral birds articulate sing Within the desert ringâ Their mighty shadows o'er broad Earth the Lunar Mountains fling, Where the Sun's chariot bathes in Ocean's fresh headspringâ O could my spirit wing! O could this Spirit, prisoned here Like thine, Immortal Murmurer! In hatefullest bounds and bonds of clay, O could this Spirit of mine away To those strange landsââAway! away!â Methought the breeze with soft command Raised itself in a sigh to say After me, whispering still âAway!â Still by my side re-echoing bland In fervorous secrecyââAway!â The desert breeze with pinion gray Rustled along the leafless sand, Warning me stillââAway! away!â Not less than magic breath had blown Ashy ambition now to flame, Within me; but like veins in stone Red grew the blood in my cold frame: Tho' drained this life-spring to the lees On lancing rocksâthis body worn, Weed-wrung, and saturate with seas Gulped thro'âby their wild mercy borne Half jellied hither, and well nigh Piecemeal by those white coursers torn That shook their manes of me, foam high, Cast on their saviour backs forlornâ Tho' thus my flesh, my spirit still Is unsubdued! aspiring will Buoys up my sinking power. 'Tis thine, This quenchless spark! To thee this glow, This rise from my sea-grave I owe, Nepenthe! vital fire divine! Yet ah! what boots, if cup of bliss Have such a bitter dreg as this? Fragile and faint must I still on The arduous path that I have gone, Or burn in my own sighs! Like thee, A winged cap, O Mercury! I wear, that lifts me still to heaven, Tho' down to herd with mortals driven. Now as swift as Sadness may Let me to those hills away, Where the shadows of the Moon Reach broad earth at brightest noon, Where the Sun's car glittering Waits at Ocean's fresh headspring, And sweet oral birds do sing Wild catches in the desert ring, Mocking the changeful-crested King! That must be where Cybele rears Her tow'red head above the spheres, Awful to Gods! where Eden high, With terraced stairs that climb the sky, Long lost to mortal ken doth lie. E'en let me thither sad and slow As wayworn he from thence doth go, Reptilous Nile!âAs shades that pass Silent and soft o'er fields of grass, So let my trackless spectre glide His solitary wave beside. Hundred-gated City! thou With gryphoned arch and avenue For denizen giants, serve they now But to let one poor mortal thro'? Wide those streaming gates of war Ran once with many a conqueror, Horseman and chariot, to the sound Of the dry serpent blazoning round Theban Sesostris' dreaded name. Where is now the loud acclaim? Where the trample and the roll, Shaking staid Earth like a mole? Sunk to a rushes sigh!âFarewell, Thou bleached wilderness o'erblown By treeless winds, unscythable Sandbanks, with peeping rocks bestrown, That for thy barrenness seem'st to be The bed of some retreated sea! City of Apis, shrine and throne, Fare thee well! dispeopled sheer Of thy mighty millions, here Giant thing inhabits none, But vast Desolation! Fare well thee!âand lowly too, Ye rev'rend sites, colossal names, EsnÃ© and Ombos and Edfou, Echoing still your bygone fames In such ponderous syllables, Howsoe'er forgotten else. Over white-cliffed Elephantine, Thro' thy quarries red and gray, Womb of sublimity, Syene Onward still I take my way: Where broad Nile with deafening hymn Enters the land of Mizraim, O'er sounding cliffs made musical By his wave-choral waterfall; Athwart high Nubia's tawny shelves, Down which ploughing deep he delves, Long strider of the level sands, Three cataract steps to lower lands. Scarce my fiery breath I cool In thee, hill-hollowed Ipsambul, Where primeval Troglodyte Turned the torrid day to night. Helmed high within the gloom, Thy pillaring statues sit sublime, Taking, each side, colossal room On granite thrones no king might climb, And keeping halled state till Doom, Co-templar Deities with Time. Or before thy porch profound By the choked river's antique roll, From their seats, dry fathoms drowned, Peering mildly over ground, Head-free, along the desert shoal, If not with form discumbered whole, Looking blank on, as they did see Far o'er this little earthy knoll Into thy depths, Infinity. Narrowing now my path begins Toward the lofty Abyssins; Now in silk-soft fleece below, Shrunk to miniature sound and show, Tumbos' cataract seems to flow A visual roar, and that high steep Jebel Arambo, a step deep. Now while this keen air renews, On my strength its aim pursues, From that old sand-swallowed Isle Meroe, doubled by the Nile, Balking before whose watery bar Vainly Simoom his dragon cheers, That sandward home from Senaar Back on his stormy rider rears; Fierce recusant to daggle still His dusty wings at that blind will! So I too, in dragon scorn, With red breath like the desert-born, Bicker against the winds that press Me from that broad wilderness, Westward then, where Nile divides In two varicolour tides, Milky and sable, I shall rise By that soft galaxy to the skies. Thanks, Nepenthe fine, for this Living apotheosis! Hark! above me I do hear Heavenly joybells ringing clear, And see their golden mouths, ding-dong, Vibrate with a starry tongue. Welcome! welcome! still they toll Syllabled sweetly in knell-knoll, While more deep, with undulous swell, Chimes unseen the burden-bell, Mellowing, in the mighty boom Of his huge sonorous womb, Their sweet clangour, like the din Of streams lost in a roaring lynn. Twilight now o'er lawn and dale Draws her dew-enwoven veil, Tender-bosomed flowers to keep Unruffled in their balmy sleep; Her's from planet fair and star Day's last blushing Hour doth steal, Those bright rivals to reveal, And the Queen Moon, their non-pareil, Rolling between her noiseless car, Where in heaven-wide race they reel Light splintering from each glassy wheel. Small birds now thro' leafy shed Rustling haste to bower and bed, And the Roc, slow winnowing, sails Heavily homeward thro' the vales Clanging betimes, while they do cheep, The tremblers, and more inwood creep. Then shall not I, in some thick sward Rest me, like gazelle or pard, Brinded hyÃ¦na or zebir barred; Now that even these supple rovers Hie to caves and healthy covers, There to sleep till huntress Morn Rouse them again with her far horn! Solitary wayfarer! Minstrel winged of the green wild! What dost thou delaying here, Like a wood-bewildered child Weeping to his far-flown troop, Whoop! and plaintive whoop! and whoop? Now from rock and now from tree, Bird! methinks thou whoop'st to me, Flitting before me upward still With clear warble, as I've heard Oft on my native Northern hill No less wild and lone a bird, Luring me with his sweet chee-chee Up the mountain crags which he Tript as lightly as a bee, O'er steep pastures, far among Thickets and briary lanes along, Following still a fleeting song! If such my errant nature, I Vainly to curb or coop it try Now that the sundrop thro' my frame Kindles another soul of flame! Whoop on, whoop on, thou canst not wing Too fast or far, thou well-named thing, Hoopoe, if of that tribe which sing Articulate in the desert ring! Striding the rough mountain mane Of Earth, her forelock now I gain, Whence I behold the lucid spheres As thick as ocean dropt in tears On the sapphire-paven ciel, That close now to my head doth wheel. Brighter the Moon, and brighter glows! Broader and broader still she grows! On that steepling pinnacle With glance rocks silver-slated down, Her radiant ball sits tangible, Huge pearl of Afric's mountain crown! Ponderous jewel of Earth's crest! There, star-studded she doth rest, Filling every vale and lea From her lucid fountain free, Bank high, as with a crystal sea. Flooded bright each woodland moves Crisp as the sounding coral groves, And each emerald lane doth seem Bed of a diamond-watered stream. But lo! what mighty shadows cast Their lengths upon the glittering vast Portentous, as with giant reach Eclipse thro' fields of air did stretch Printing the lunar hills upon Earth's disk in darkest colours dun? Ha! more true shall Fantasy, Twin-brother profane to Prophecy, Interpret yon bright written sign, Blazoning the dome with sense divine. Yon far luminary stands Apparent on these peaked lands, Meanful device and monogram Of their veritable nameâ The Mountains of the Moon! long known On Afric's groin enormous zone, But trod by mortal me alone! 'Less Gomer here did set his shoon, Crossing to southern Zanguebar, And call'd them Jebel-el-Gomar, Arabiqued, Mountains of the Moon: Since that double word implies This sense, and toward the Star they rise Her semblable footstool in the skies. Now that she sinks amid the hills And vaporous gloom her region fills, Tearful light each orb distils, Faintly closing his small eye! Wrapt in stole of sablest dye, Death-heavy Darkness on his throne Nods like a corse! What Anguish draws That sigh, to make Existence pause, And the deep slumberers under stone Turn in their wormy beds and groan? Yet, a more terrible moan! Like the buried Titan's sob Bursting Etna's rocky chains It shakes huge Afric with a throb, Her stout girdle scarce sustains. Hark, another!âbut like the sound Of hell's breath bubbling up thro' pools profound, Sent forth in cloudy wise! And now that Dawn, with flickering plumage gray, Brushes the thick-spun web of Night away, Two pools in mist and murmur bubble before mine eyes! Black-watered that: right o'er Its cave, a bust of Mauritanian mood, Thick-lipt and carved in negro curls, as rude As the grim lake itself in wavy tresses wore: This ripples in soft ringlets, and sleek folds Of milky undulance, eastward oozing The hill's green shoulders down, diffusing His wealth of waters o'er the humble wolds: Not like his dark Brother making His chasmy way, by choice, nor taking Precipitous steps into the Atlantic holds. Over the smooth well-front was seen Cut in a stony table of Syene, A head, of that colossal leaven, But with mild looks, and patient eyeballs graven, Waiting for day! She rose, maternal Morn! With her first golden smile greeting the brow Memnonian, and with balmiest sighs Breathing her soul of love into those sanguine eyes That gazed with large affection on the skies! And like the joy of a faint-swelling horn Heard far aloof, notes of glad welcome now Rose from the steep front of the Goddess-born. Charactered underneath upon the stone I read these mystic words alone: Memnonâthe God of the Blue Riverâthe King Of the Endless Valleyâwhoever his spirit Will free from earthly fetters, let him mingle A cup of darkness here with one of light, Fit opiate for Life's fever, And so be blest, pouring it on his brain. Two cups I mingled, dark and light, From that black fountain and this white, Pouring the opiate deftly down The Nile-God's cleft and hollow crown, As I divined his will. The air Grew vocal for a moment there, With out-flown shriek of joy; and where Welkin aloft the sunbird sings, I heard a clap and rush of wings, As if some earth-pent spirit freed Rose to the realms of bliss indeed! Memnon from that day, by the shore Of Nile, sits murmurless evermore! Thy claybound spirit is free, and mine Still in this barry skeleton pine? No!âand I quaffed from either well The mingled cup of heaven and hell! Darkness began to hood the sky, Methought, once more, the day to die On this bleak death-bed, but not I! From the sharp East a blackening wind Came with broad vans the hills behind, In her cloud-hung pavilion Rolling Death's sable sister on, Portentous Night! Within the fold Of its dark valance I was rolled Whirling, steep down, as in a pall Down the great gulf's eternal fall. No sun came forth again; but gray As the still rocks on which I lay Bleaching at last, endured the day. O'er me the hard sky, massy-paven, Seemed to be dropping crags from heaven To make Earth dust, and hurricanes Let scatter on her their whistling manes. So, with his ensigns wet, Monsoon Swept o'er the Mountains of the Moon, Dreadfully calling cloud on cloud From the deep South, that in thick crowd, Swoln with the summons, bellying ran To burst their rude strength in the van, Till mass o'er mass enormous hurled Heavily toppling stood the world! Such terror vain Ambition waits Still on the high tops he would tread: Stand fast, ye thunder-shaken gates, Against the rain-flood, o'er my head Beating like ocean on his bed! O let me wing unshent again To sweet Earth's lowest, lowliest plain; Then let the rushing deluge sweep Her proudest pinnacles to the deep! Desert paths of the dry streams! Swifter than the torrent teems Scourged by South winds, as I flee Spread your gray sands firm for me! Pendant cliffs with sheltering brow Shade me from destruction now! Rocky steps of giant stride Descending Afric, down your side, Your unhewn smoothness let me slide! Air! O air, with thickening breath Stay me not in the gripe of Death! Back by the blown locks who doth still Pull me to his cruel will; Let me into thy sightless sea Like the poor minnow from the shark, From those fell jaws that gape for me, Plunge into deepest abysses dark! Welcome dusky, unsunned dells, Roofed with savage trees o'erblown, Caverns in whose dripping cells Hermit Sadness sits alone! Eldern forests, whispering dim Secrets in your dread Sanhedrim, And nodding fate on those below; Fearless thro' such inquest grim, Rustling your mossy beards I go, Fathomless falls for wild Despair! Gulfs intransible of deep air! Gladly from yon tempest I To your terrible shelter fly. Welcome, rocky vaults and rude Cave-continued for the flood That rolls his serpent-strength between, Hissing beside me tho' unseen, Thro' his vast ambush subterrene; Chasms with cragged teeth beset, Swallow me deeper, deeper yet! Lowliest path is least unsure, Most sublime, most insecure! Fond Earth, within her parent breast Finds us, weak little ones, safe room, And thither pain or care opprest, Sooner or later as their doom All creep for refuge and for rest. Shadowy aisles of pillared trees Now my errant fancy please, Dim cathedral walks like these; Nave by numerous transepts crost, Each in his own long darkness lost, Cloister and chancel, thick embossed Their roofs with pendant foliage, thro' Whose fretted branchwork richly pours The sun, in golden order due, His bright mosaic on the floors. Spreading now the darksome bourne, Into warm twilight I return, Still by these umbrageous eaves Sheltered; and where the thinner leaves, With verdant panes, too bright illume, Glance and pass forward into gloom Thro' the dim-green air I hear Only the rush of waters near, Or see their spray a moment gleam, Watermotes in the passing beam. By that visionary shore Steep channel of continual roar, Billowy duct of flowing thunder, That wallows the rooted woodland under, Wandering I, in dizzy wonder, Tread the hollow crust that caves The rueful Erebus of waves Beneath me surging. Blind I roam The wilderness. O gentle Eve! Pale daughter of the Day, receive My greeting glad!âAll hail, thou dome Of God's great Temple, lit so bright With lamps of ever-living light, Kept trim within those censers rare By Virgins quiring to their care, Voice-joined, tho' separate in far air. Awful Night! thy sombre plumes, Shadowed athwart the moonlight pale, Make this rock-bestudded vale Gleam like an antique place of tombs, With lustre cold that chills the gale. Grateful now to fallen me This deep tranquillity! Here in folded silence fast Shall I fix myself at last, Till I grow by age as grey As the rocks, and stiff as they, Making ever here my own Statue and monumental stone! Cliff, of smoothest front sublime, Tablet for that old storier Time! What huge aboriginal sons Of Earth, beat down by vengeful waves, Sleep beneath these obliterate stones In unmeasurable graves? What mystic word inscribed can show His terrible might who sleeps below?â Sinews resolved to wreaths of sand! Seams of white dust his bony frame! His place on Glory's scroll doth stand Blankâor filled up with others' fame! Yet was he one that Pelion-high Clomb perchance the difficult sky Pelion on Oeta and Ossa heaved Till of sight and sense bereaved, Storm or sun stricken as I! Ay, and shall Adam's pigmy sperm Think to reach that sacred sphere Which, from high-battled hills infirm, No Briarean arms came near; Or think that his small memory dear, Writ in the sands, shall aye survive, While the eternal headstones here Keep no giant name alive? The sands of thy own life, Renown, Run between two creations down, Few centuries apart! What need Glorious thought, or word, or deed, When all mortal grandeur must Lie with oblivion in the dust? Then hie on to humble lands! On, still onward let me roam, O'er sea-broad Sahara sands, By the cataract's grizzled foam, Where live-bounding he doth come, Headlong Niger! down the rocks, Swept with his dishevelled locks, Sable turned to silver flocks, Like dark rain to driven snow, When the blasts hibernal blow! Now my steps as mute proceed By his solitary roll Winding round each desert knoll As a gay enamelled mead, With its yellow-blossom reed Single bright thing that doth breed There; and rushy tufts of grass Only sighing as we pass: This wide waste of air unstirred By the voice of bee or bird, Even the soaring eagle's scream Far off, like music in a dream Imaged to the ear, is heard. Strange pleasure in such wild to wander Following murmurless Meander, That loses his own serpent folds Oft within the sabulous wolds. May not I, ere these be crost, Grave of all things living, be lost, Now that in this inky lake, Dry Afric's mediterranean, Unsailed sea, the Mountain Snake Buries his sightless head again? Yet whate'er my soul inspire, Purple sweet instinct with fire, Or that late delirious draught, Which from lunar wells I quaffed, Still I turn where sand and sky Spread in blank boundlessness to mine eye. Thou, night-shaded Fountain! pure Essence of darkness, deep distilled, 'Tis thou that hast my soul, most sure, With thy sad infusion filled! Else wherefore love I thus to tread O'er the dust of Nature dead, Buried in her own ashes gray, Without one offspring of her womb To strew her even a leafy tomb? Wherefore love I thus to stray, Finding joy in the lone wild, Like Desertion's only child, That in the sunburnt, silent air Builds his crumbling castles there And builds and plays with his despair? Solitude as deep and wide, Treeless and herbless, never trod Gray Triton underneath the tide, Wandering the tawny barrens broad. All is dumb, and the dead sands Lie in long warps on both hands, Furrows incult or barely sown, Like desecrate lands, with salt alone, Seed of sterility!âO more fleet Must be my Arimaspian feet To 'scape this dragon of the air, Winding me round with sulphury flare, Than the wild ostrich as she glides Sheer onward with unpanting sides! Lo! in the mute mid wilderness, What wondrous creature, of no kind, His burning lair doth largely press, Gaze fixt, and feeding on the wind? His fell is of the desert dye, And tissue adust, dun-yellow and dry, Compact of living sands; his eye Black luminary, soft and mild, With its dark lustre cools the wild. From his stately forehead springs, Piercing to heaven, a radiant horn! Lo, the compeer of lion-kings, The steed self-armed, the Unicorn! Ever heard of, never seen, With a main of sands between Him and approach; his lonely pride To course his arid arena wide, Free as the hurricane, or lie here, Lord of his couch as his career! Wherefore should this foot profane His sanctuary, still domain? Let me turn, ere eye so bland Perchance be fire-shot, like heaven's brand, To wither my boldness! Northward now, Behind the white star on his brow Glittering straight against the Sun, Far athwart his lair I run. What marvellous things I saw besides, Wandering heaven's wide furnace thro', With floor of burning sands, and sides And glowing cope of glassy blue, Ne'er could mortal tongue nor ear Intelligibly tell or hear! Enow to have seen and sung of those Beauteous chimeras, called in scorn, Single of species both, and born Mid among mankind, that but knows The PhÅnix and the Unicorn Ev'n now, as dim-seen thro' a horn! Both symbols of proud solitude, One of melancholy gladness, One of most majestic sadness, And therefore to such neighbourhood I won, by sympathetic madness, Where let no other steps intrude! Across the desert's shrivelled scroll I past, myself almost to sands Crumbling, to make another knoll Amidst the numberless of those lands. Welcome! Before my bloodshot eyes, Steed of the East, a camel stands, Mourning his fallen lord that dies. Now, as forth his spirit flies, Ship of the Desert! bear me on, O'er this wavy-bosomed lea, That solid seemed and staid anon, But now looks surging like a sea.â On she bore me, as the blast Whirling a leaf, to where in calm A little fount poured dropping-fast On dying Nature's heart its balm. Deep we sucked the spongy moss, And cropt for dates the sheltering palm, Then with fleetest amble cross Like desert, fed upon like alm. That most vital beverage still, Tho' near exhaust, preserved me till Now the broad Barbaric shore Spread its havens to my view, And mine ear rung with ocean's roar, And mine eye glistened with its blue! Till I found me once again By the ever-murmuring main, Listening across the distant foam My native church bells ring me home. Alas! why leave I not this toil Thro' stranger lands, for mine own soil? Far from ambition's worthless coil, From all this wide world's wearying moil,â Why leave I not this busy broil, For mine own clime, for mine own soil, My calm, dear, humble, native soil! There to lay me down at peace In my own first nothingness?</field>
