      <field name="fulltext">[VOLUME THE FIRST.] Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Here begynneth the Lyfe of Roberte the Deuyll. Lysten, lordinges, that of marueyles lyke to heare, Of actes that were done sometyme in dede By oure elders, that before vs were: How some in myschieffe their lyfe dyd leade. And in this boke may ye se, yf that ye will rede, Of one Robert the deuyll, borne in Normandye, That was as uengeable a man as myght treade On goddes grounde: for he delyted all in tyranye. A Duke sometyme in Normandye there was, Full uertuous and deuoute in all hys lyuynge; And in almose dedes. He yede in the waye of grace, Of knyghtlye maners, and manfull in iustynge: A Lordlye parsone, also courtes in euery thynge. Hys dwellynge was at Nauerne vpon sayne At Chrystmas, to honoure that holy tyme, Open housholde he kepte, and to please God was fayne. A feaste he helde vpon a certayne daye. Lordes come thyther of greate renowne; And as they sate at dyner, a knyght gan saye Vnto the Duke, and on hys knees kneled downe: My lorde, he sayd, ye be owner of many a towne, Yet haue ye no lady, nor none heyre, After your dayes to reioyce youre grounde; Therfore gett youe a princes, that ys yonge and fayre. Wyueles longe, said the duke, haue I taryed, And lyued sole withoute any mate. I se well yt ys youre wyll, that I shoulde be maryed; But yet woulde I have one to myne estate Accordynge: for and I shoulde take A Lady of nobler bloude than I am, Or else of lower degre, soone shoulde I forsake Myne owne worship, and lyue lyke no man. Yf I shoulde nowe wedde, and after repent, And lyue in sorowe and greate langoure, Than myght I saye that fortune had me sent A chaunce mysfortunate, dystaynynge the floure Of noble fame that shoulde encrease myne honoure. Wherfore, lordes, all accordinge to prudence: A foresight, sayeth Salomon, ys worthe treasoure; Yet be we ruled by fortune, a Lady of excellence. Than sayde to the Duke a Baron right bolde: My lorde, I beseke youre grace of audyence. The Duke bade hym than saye what he woulde. In Burgonye, sayd the Baron, ys a ladye of reverence, Daughter to the Earle; yf yt please youre magnyficence Her for to take, there wyll no man saye naye. Than to hys wordes the Duke gave credence, And sayde: I knowe well the Earles doughter, that lady gaye. In processe, that lady to the Duke was maryed; A feaste was made of greate solempnytye; And twelve yeares together they taryed In wealth and greate prosperytye. Goddes lawe they kepte, and lyued vertuouslye: Yet chylde together had they none. They prayed to God with heart deuoutlye, Yf yt pleased hym for to sende them one. Euer they prayed, but yt woulde not be; In twelve yeare chylde had they none. Good dedes they dyd, and gave almose plentye: Alacke, said thys Ladye, shall I lyve alone? Ofte she syghed, and made greate mone, That no chylde on her body woulde sprynge. The good Duke also ever dyd grone, And sayed: good Jesu! yet heare my cryenge. Lorde, sende me a chylde the worlde to multyplye, The Duke sayde, yf it be thy wyll; My wyfe soroweth in her partye; I feare that she wyll her selfe spyll. Nothinge to the lorde that ys vnpossyble; Nowe heare my prayer for loue of thy mother; Sende me a chylde, my petycion to fullfyll: For to be myrry I desyre none other. And on a tyme the Duke and Duches walked In a garden by them selfe alone. Eche of them complayned, and to other talked, Howe they could have no chylde, and made much mone Full greate, and saide: joy have we none. I curse them, saide the Duke, that made the maryage: For I had leuer to have lyued styll alone. Chylde have I none to reioyce myne herytage. And said: yf I had be maryed to another ladye, I knowe that I should have had chyldren ynowe. The Duches aunswered as for her partye: Yf I had chaunged, verylye I trowe That chyldern I shoulde haue had; none haue I by youe. Let vs thanke god of that he doth vs sende: For I belave, and do verely trowe, That all oure sorowe he may yt amende. So, on a morowe, the Duke went on huntynge. Hys hearte was fullfylled all with thought; In hys mynde [he] chydde and, agayne god grudgynge, He sighed sore inwordlye and ofte; If he myght haue dyed, nothynge he rought; And sayde: god loueth not me, all in dyspayre. Many women haue chyldren, but myne nought; Alas, I trowe I shall haue none to be myne heyre. The fende tempted soore the Duke tho, That he wyst not what to do nor saye. He left huntynge, and homewarde he dyd go, And in to hys chaumber he toke the waye. So there the Duches at the same tyme laye, In as greate trouble as her husbande was; And to her lorde saide, no chylde I beare maye; I am vnhappye; and therewith sayde alas. He toke her in hys armes, and her kyste; And of that Lady he had all hys pleasure, And so begate a chylde, and yt not wyste. The Duke to oure Lorde made hys prayer, For to sende hym a chylde for to gladde hys chere. The ladye saide: the Deuyll nowe send vs one: For god wyll not oure petycion heare; Therfore I trowe power hath he none. She sayde: yf I be conceyued thys houre nowe, I geve yt to the deuyll both soule and bodye. Lo, thys lady was nere folysshe I trowe, And fullfylled with greate obstynacye. Her owne soule there she put in greate ieopardye: For that houre she dyd conceyve with a man chylde, That, when he was borne, lyued myscheuouslye, In thefte and murder lyke a tyraunte wylde. The tyme drewe so, that nyne monethes was past; Than her tyme drewe on verye nye. At the houre of byrth she laboured fast, More than a moneth, the boke doth specyfye. She had many throwes with many a pytheous crye; Ladyes prayed for her, and gaue almese dede; They trowed verelye that she shoulde dye; With that our ladye wold her helpe and spede. And assone as Robert the deuyll was borne, The skyes waxed blacke, that yt was wonder; And sodenlye there began a full greate storme: Rayne, lyghtenynge, with horrible thonder. They feared that the house woulde ryue a sonder. Then blewe the wynde with greate power, That they wende the dome had be comen there: For downe wente wyndowes and euery doore, Halfe the house the deuyll pulled downe, Yet at the last the wether waxed cleare. So for dreade thys lady laye in a sowne, That greate wetherynge she dyd sore feare. Her gentlewomen bade her be of good chere; They told her that the wather was gone and past; Then to the churche the chylde they dyd bear, And chrystened yt Robert at the last. He was as bygge the same daye, As some chylde of twelue monethes olde. When they came from Churche, he cryed all the waye, That yt made many hym to beholde. Men sade the chylde loked very bolde. Hys teeth grewe fast; when that he shoulde soucke, The noryshe nypples so harde byte he woulde, That yt went then to her verye hearte roote. There durst no woman geue hym sucke in faye: For hys teeth grewe so peryllousslye, That the norysshe nypples he bote a waye; But than they woulde no more byde the ieopardye. So with an horne he was fedde trewlye. At the years ende, he could bothe go and speake. The elder he waxed, the more vnhappye Shrewdenes he woulde do bothe in house and streate. Hurte woulde he do to woman and man; Vngracious was he daye and nyght. Yf he amonge any chyldren came, He woulde them hurte, bothe scratche and byte, Caste stones at theyr heades, and fyght, Breake their shynnes, and put some eyes oute. Lordes and ladyes of hym had greate delyght, And wende yt had ben but wantonnes with oute doute. Mennes chyldren there he dyd muche harme; Of them he hurte shrewdelye many a one, Break[yng]e bothe legge, headde and arme. Therefore he was beloued of none; Hys companye chyldren forsoke euerychone; They dyd flee fro hym, as the deuyll fro holy water. We wyll not haue hym amonge vs to come, They sayd: and he never do, we be the gladder. For, and the chyldern had seen hym come In to the streate, there for to playe, They woulde take theyr legges, and away runne To theyr fathers, as faste as they maye. Roberte the Deuyll dothe come, they woulde saye: For younge chyldren gave hym that name. The chyldren hydde them in corners euery day, And to runne from hym they woulde leaue their game. And whan that he was aboute seuen yeare of Ã¡ege, Hys father sette hym to scole in dede With a dyscrete man and a sage, And prayed hys sonne, that he woulde spede, For to learne bothe to wryte and reade; And to Roberte the Deuyll hys father sayde: Sonne, yf thy lyfe in vertue thoue leade, Than wyll I with the be right well a payed. Roberte the Deuyll wente to scole a lytell space, And euer he thought yt to longe ywys. He learned so that he was past all grace; Yt happened at the last he dyd amysse; Hys master sayd: Syr, youe muste amende thys, Or elles forsothe ye shalbe beate. He sayde: yf thou smyte me, I wyll make the wysshe, That thou thyne owne fleshe rather had eate. Naye, sayde hys master, ye be to bolde; And toke a rodde for to chaste hym soone. So to beate hym he sayde that he woulde; Roberte sawe what he purposed to done, And sayde: ye were better lette me a lone: For with a dagger he thrust hym in to the bellye, That the bloude ran downe in to hys shone; So [he] slewe hys master, and let hym deade lye. Whan Robert the Deuyll sawe hys master fall, He sayde he woulde go to scole no more. Hys boke he threwe agaynste the wall. The deuyll have the whyt that he was forye therfore; Alacke he made hys fathers hearte soore. When that he hys master had slayne, The Duches cursed the houre that he was bore; She sayde: of hys companye no man is fayne, After that, there woulde no pryst hym teache; He folowed uice, he woulde be ruled by none; And mocke prystes, whan they shoulde preache. For, and he into the churche had gone, He would skorne the clearkes euerychone, And when they songe, come them behynde, So threwe dust in theyr mowthes by one and one, And some in theyr eyes to make them blynde. Yf he sawe any men or women deuoutlye knele, For to serue God with theyr prayer, or stande, Pryuelye behynde them woulde he steale, And geue them a sowce with hys hande, To cause some to yell out theyr tongues longe; Or els he woulde make theyr heades go to grounde. Theyr neckes he hurte sore, he was so stronge; And many olde folkes he caused to sounde. Yt was vnpossible for a clarke to write The dedes he dyd, that weare full vengeable. Then gentlemen, that weare sadde and dyscrete, Complayned to hys father withoute fable. The Duke sayde: to chaste hym I am not able. Than Robert was brought before hym; He sayde: Sonne, thy dedes ben reproueable; Thou shamest me and all thy hole kynne. Thow doest all thynge that dyspleaseth God; Thy scolemaster thou slewest with a knyfe, Because that he woulde haue beate the with a rodde; To the prystes in churche thou doest mueh greyfe; Full ofte I wyshe me oute of my lyfe: For thou of thy dedes arte so houge and peryllouse, That chyldren younge, bothe mayde and wyfe, Whych dothe the knowe, geueth the theyr curse. All one wyth hym: in at the one eare and out at the other. He was neuer the better, daye nor nyght. Hys olde laye kept, he woulde do none other; He was neuer glad but when he dyd fyght; To swere and lye, theryn he had greate delyght. At last hys mother to her lorde spake, And sayd: yt were best to make hym a knyght; Thys noble ordre let Robert the deuyll take. For I trust then he wyll amende, Whan he that greate othe doth heare; Yt wyll make hym sorye for that he dyd offende, And the workes of God hereafter for to leare. The Duke consented euen ryght there, And asked Robert, yf he woulde lyue vnder awe Of God, and the order of knight-hode beare, He aunswered: I sett not thereby a strawe. At the last, Robert was made a knyght; Hys father bade hym take hede of hys othe, To dystroye wronge, and to maynteyne right, And do trewe justyce for leefe or for lothe: For a knyght, that in cheualrye goethe, Euer agaynst vice he muste fyght, And supporte trewe maydens; and he so dothe, He ys an inherytoure of heauen, goddes own knyght. Robert aunswered: father, at youre commandement, I wyll thys greate order vpon me take; But for to chaunge all myne entent, As for my manners, I wyll not forsake. All men shall not ones me make For to leaue my customes old; I will contynewe, and neuer wyll slake, Thoughe I therfore my lyfe lose shoulde. The Duke caused a greate iustynge to be; Lordes came fro many a farre lande, And Ladyes also, that runnynge to see, He that shoulde be moste doughtye of hande. There was many a knyght full stronge, That thought theyr clothes of full greate pryce: Yet a gayne Roberte there myght none stande, As for worship by hym woulde none ryse. A fyelde was ordeyned bothe brode and wyde, With lystes fayre where they shoulde runne; Tentes were pyght on euery syde; Greate was the people that thether come. The daye was fayre; hote shone the sonne. Greate trumpets blewe; the herauldes made theyr crye, That euery knyght hys deuoure shoulde done, For to proue who was moste myghtye. Knightes then dressed them to the fyelde In Syluer armoure, fayre and bright; Barons doughtye with speare and shylde, With helmes and haubreks that all the fyelde dyd lyght; Stedes in trappoure the[r] was a goodlye syght; Speare heades that a stronge cote woulde saylle; Clothe of golde in harnes curyouslye pyght; Worne of haburgin many a stronge mayle. Robert the deuyll came in as meke as a Lyon, In hys fyste he had a greate speare, Of sure wodde both toughe and longe; Hys loke so grymme many men dyd feare, Also that houghe staffe that he dyd beare Was almost as bygge as some twayne. Vnoccupyed, saide Robert, why stande we here? For to leaue all worke he woulde full fayne. The Duke bade them all to begynne. A fayre knyght then sentred hys speare; In fayth, sayde Robert, I wyll runne to hym; And lyghtly turned hys greate stede theare. Eche agayne other speares dyd beare; Those coursers dyd runne; they smote in the fyelde; Hartye were bothe; nought dyd they feare. That knyght smote Robert sore in the shyelde, That the stroke made Robert right wrothe. To hym he thought for to ryde agayne; He sentred hys speare, and forthe he gothe. With hys shyelde Robert mette playne, And stroke so soore that he smote it euen in twayne, And throughe the knightes shulder the speare dyd runne. I trowe therof Robert was fayne, And asked yf any more woulde come. Another knyght thought Robert to assaylle, So yode they together with greate raundone. Loth were they bothe for to fayle, And hastelye theyr stedes strongelye dyd runne. So swyfte with strenght Robert dyd come, That hys speare ran thorowe the knyghtes bodye, And to the earthe dead fell he downe. All men wondred of Robert trewlye. The thyrde knyght to the grounde he smote, And brake hys horse backe asonder. There was none that myght stande a stroke Of hym that daye. Nowe the people dyd wonder To se that all knyghtes to hym wer vnder: For so soore Robert dyd them assayle, A man had ben as good to haue be smytten with thonder, As to haue a stroke of hys hand, without fayle. Thre noble Barons he slewe there that daye. He fared as he had ben a fyende of hell; All was in earneste, and not in playe: Fro theyr horses many knyghtes he fell, And brake theyr armes, as the bokes do tell. For he threwe [theym] so greselye and soore, That they knewe nother wo nor well; On stedes myght they ryde never more. All that he mette, he them downe threwe; Yonge nor olde he spared none: For pittye had he no more than a Jue. That daye he hurte there many a one, And lyke a boore at the mouth he dyd fome; He fought and stroke all, while that he was able In peace he woulde not haue them to stande alone; He loued murderers that were euer vengeable. To kill and slea was all hys delyght. Tenne noble stedes backes he dyd brust, When that he at theyr masters dyd smyte, Or with hys speare at them dyd thrust. To fight euer more and more he had lust: For all hys pleasure was in deathe sett, And euer he cryed: who wyll more iuste? The deuyll was in hym; no man myght hym lette. And whan hys father sawe, howe in vengeaunce He was sett, and woulde no sad wayes take, In hys thought he toke greate greuance, And bade that all the knyghtes shoulde departe, Eche theyr waye, and no more justes to make. Than Robert woulde not obey the commaundement Of hys father, but sayd sorowe shoulde awake: For then in myscheif he sett all hys ententte. He woulde not go fro the battaylle, But hue and slewe on euery syde. The stronge knightes there he dyd assaylle; All the people fledde, they durst not abyde; The knyghtes all awaye dyde tyde, With lordes and Ladyes euerychone. Robert loughe, whan he that spyed; Than, thought he, I will no more go home. Than Robert rode into the countrey, And robbed and kylled many a one. Maydens and wyues he rauyshed pytteouslye; He pulled downe abbeys and houses of stone. For [of] all the Churches that he dyd by come, Thorowe that countrey of Normandye, By hys wyll there shoulde stande none: For all hys pleasure was in murder and robberye. He brente houses, and slewe yonge chyldren; Death vpon death was all hys lyfe. The countrey complayned to hys father, Howe theyr seruantes were slayne with Robertes knyfe. Some sayde: he hathe rauyshed my wyfe, And by oure doughters he hathe layne; They prayed the Duke to stynte that stryfe, Or to flee that lande they would full fayne. The Duke wepte and sayde: alas, That euer I hym begate on woman. My prayer vnto Jesu euer was, For to sende me a chylde: for I had none. And nowe gode hath sente me one, That maketh me full heauy and sad. The Duches wayled, and made great mone, That from her mynde she was nye madde. The Duke made hys seruantes to ryde To seke Robert, in Cyttie and in towne; Good watche was layde on euery syde, On holte and heath, in fyelde and towne. And in euery place that they dyd come, The countrey Robert dyd curse and blame, And prayed that he myght haue an yll death soone: For he the ordre of knyghthode dothe shame. With Robert at the last these men mette. They sayde that he shoulde with them then goo; All aboute Robert shortlye they sette; One asked hym what he woulde doo: Wylt thou go with vs? he sayde noo; And drewe hys sworde, and with them dyd fyght. Full greate woundes he gaue one or twoo, And all the resydue he put to flyght. And all that he toke he put theyr eyes oute, So bade them go seke theyr way home, And serued them all so withoute doute; These poore men they made greate mone; So Robert departed and lefte them alone, And sayde: tell my father that yt ys for hys sake. Then these men in tyme to the courte came home, And shewed what mastryes Robert dyd make. Thys good Duke in hearte was right wo, When he sawe hys mennes eyes oute. Fore angre he wyst not what to do, But commaunded all the courte aboute, Counstables and bayllifes with all theyr route, All men to take hym who so maye, And in pryson to put hym without doute, He charged all men good watche to laye. So when Robert knewe of thys warke, He gathered a great companye theues yll. He gate hym into a forrest full darke, Where yt was farre from boroughe or hyll. There he lyued, and all dyd he kyll, That he myght se in the heath so playne; Corne and fruites all dyd he spyll; In doynge myscheif allwaye was he fayne. Yt was hys pleasure to eate fleshe on the frydaye; A dogge dyd faste as well as he. Poore pylgrymes he kylled goynge by the waye, And holy hermytes that lyued deuoutlye. So on a daye he rose vppe earlye, And in the forrest seuen hermytes he founde, Before a crosse knelynge on theyr knee; Of theyr prayers to heauen wente the sownde. What, holy whoresones, he sayde, by youe, That gapeth vpwardes after the moone? If ye be a thrust, ye shall drynke nowe; And oute he drewe hys swearde full soone. The hermytes wyst no what to done, But suffered death for Jesus sake. So throughe one of theyr bodyes hys sworde dyd runne, For feare all the other dyd tremble and quake. Than he strake of theyr heades all, And reioysed at that peryllouse dede. In scorne he sayde: syrs, do youe fall, Patter and praye ye in youre crede. Full faste these holy men dyd blede, That Robertes clothes were readde as vermulon. With hys sworde he thought further to spede, In vengeaunce he rought not where he become. Lo, thys caytiffe was blynde, and myght not see; The cloudes had y-clypped the Sunne of grace; Lyke to an apple that the core dost putryfie, The darke mystes of uice smote hym in the face. He was none of the shepe of Israel, but the kyd of golyas. He exyled pittye, as dyd cruel Kynge Pharao; Heaped full of synne, as euer he was That slewe hys own mother; men called hym Nero. Then he lefte these seuen hermytes deadde, And rode oute of the wodde, lyke a wylde dragon. So lyke a bore he threwe vp hys headde, The bloude of the hermytes couered all hys gowne. A shepherde he sawe, and rode to hym soone; But whan the herdes man dyd hym espye, Yt was no hede to bydde hym begone. He ranne hys waye. Then for feare dyd he crye. At the laste he the shepherde ouertoke in faye, And asked what tydynges that he woulde tell. The shepherd agayne to hym dyd saye: I was of youe afrayde, I wende ye had come oute of hell; And as for tydynges, here ys darkenes castell; There lyeth the Duches of Normandye, With many a lorde of her counsell, Of all thys greate lande the royalltye. So Robert came to the towne, there the castell stode. The people sawe one ryde as he had ben madde, With a sworde in hande, and all arayed in bloude. To runne in to house euery man was gladde. At the last Robert began to waxe sadde, And sayde: alas, that euer I was borne; In murder and myschief my lyfe haue I ladde; Hys heere of hys heade he thought to haue torne. Than he was a bashed soore in hys mode, Whan that the people woulde hym not abyde. What yt mente than he vnderstode; Euery body them selfe from hym dyd hyde. Than to the Castle gate Robert dyd ryde, And fayne with some body he woulde speake. But whan any man hym espyede, They ranne awaye as they dyd in the streate. Than with a heauy hearte downe dyd he lyght, And went streyght into the Castell hall. But when the people of hym had a sight, None durst hym byde there at all. Many for helpe dyd crye and calle; Hys mother sawe hym, as she sate at meate; For feare she beganne to fall, And hasted her awaye for to gette. And when he sawe hys mother goynge, He sayde, alas, Lady mother, speake with me. Hys hearte for sorowe brast in weepynge, Whan he sawe her from hym to flee. And sayde to hys mother full pitteouslye: Lady, tell me howe that I was borne, That I haue ledde my lyfe so mischeuouslye, In the tempests of uice, with many a greate storme. Hys mother all unto hym tolde, Howe she gave hym to the fende, both soule and bodye. And he asked her howe she durste be so bolde To gyue hym from god allmightye. I knowe, he sayd, that I haue lyued synfullye, As euer dyd the emperoure greate Nero, Amende I wyll, and for mercye crye; My dedes will I bewaylle, whersoeuer I go. Hys mother prayed hym to smyte of her headde: For the trespace, she sayde, that I dyd to thee; I am worthye therefore for to be deadde; To god I offended also in obstynacye. Slea me, she sayde, and I forgiue yt thee. He sayde: Mother, I wyll not do so; I had leuer be beaten full bytterlye, And on my feate to the worldes ende to go. Than for woo Robert fell to the grounde, And a greate whyle there he so laye. There sodenlye he rose in that stounde, And saide: Mother, nowe I go my waye, To Rome wyll I hye as fast as I maye; And prayed her to commende hym to hys father dere. So he desyred them all for hym to praye, And went forth with a full pytteous chere. So shortly Robert toke hys horse, and rode Streyght vnto the forrest to hys companye. Than the Duches, that in the Castle abode, Shryked full sore with a full pytteous crye: And saide: alas, lorde, to synfull am I. All women, beware, curse neuer your chylde; And yf that ye do, then be youe in jeopardye; Also in myscheyff they shalbe defyelde. Wyth that the Duke came into the chaumber, And asked her why she dyd wepe and wayle. She sayde: Robert youre sonne hath ben here, and shewed how that he wolde to Rome without fayle. Ah, sayde the Duke, I feare yt wyll lyttell auayle; He is not able to make restytucyon; Alacke, sayd the Duke, yet am I gladde sauns fayle, That he ys wyllynge to make hys confession. Nowe ys Robert come to the forrest agayne, And founde hys men all at dyner syttynge, To conuerte them to goodnes he would full fayne, And sayde: my felowes, with pytteous lamentynge, Let vs remember oure synfull lyuynge, And aske god mercy with greate repentaunce. Yf we leade thys lyfe styll, yt will vs brynge To hell withoute ende, with horrible vengeaunce. Let vs remember, he saide, oure synfull lyfe; We haue murdered people full cruellye; Rauyshed maydens, and many a wyfe; Slayne prystes and hermytes full pytteouslye. And abbeys haue ben dystroyed through our robbery, With Nunnes [and] Ankers. Take yt in remembraunce Howe we put them in ieopardie; Wherfore I dreade hell, with horrible vengeaunce. Houses we haue brentte many a one, And spylte of chyldren much precyous bloude. Compassion there nor pyttye had we none; In myscheyff we delyted, and neuer in good. And nowe let vs remember hym that dyed on the rode, That from vs yet hath kept hys sworde by sufferaunce: For and we nowe in deathes daunce stode, To hell shoulde we go, with horrible vengeaunce. One sayde: Robert, what, be youe there? And stode up, and began hym to skorne. Will youe see, fellowes? the fox wylbe an anker. What, master, ye be as wyse as a shepe newe shorne. I trowe youre buttocke be prycked with a thorne: For your wytt ys oute of temperaunce. I woulde not haue thys tearme aboute borne, That we shoulde to hell go with horrible vengeaunce. Another [of] these saide: master Roberte, harke; To preache to vs yt ys all in vayne; And what I saye, I praye you yt marke. Thys lyfe wyll we leade in wordes playne; Euer yet in these workes we haue be fayne; For our synne we entende not to do pennaunce. We wyll not forsake, thoughe ye stryue vs agayne; To helle woulde we rather go, with horrible vengeaunce. Than Roberte sawe, that they woulde not amende, But in myscheyf there to lyue styll, And to the poore men they wyll ofte offende; Thus then he conspyred in hys wyll, One after another for to kyll. To make short, he kylled them euerychone. He sayde: ye haue be readye euer to do euyll; Therfore alyue wyll I not leaue one. He tolde them: a good seruaunte must haue good wages; Nowe do I paye youe after your deseruynge. There dead in the floore all theyr bodyes sprayles; Robert shutt the doore, and they laye within; And [he] sayd: of myscheyf this ys the endynge. So he thought to sett the house on fyre; But he dyd not; he yede a waye sighynge, And sayd: alas, I haue payde my men theyr hyre. Than Robert toke hys horse, and blessed hym. So throughe the forrest he toke the waye, Ouer hylles and downes fast rydynge. Thus rode he styll all a longe daye, And ofte for synne he cryed well awaye. Than of an abbaye he had a sight, Whiche ofte he had robbed in good faye: Alas, saide Robert, there will I lodge to nyght. For faulte of meate then he hongred sore, And sayde: to eate fayne I wolde haue some. Alacke nowe, that euer I was bore. And when the monkes dyd se hym come, Eche man hys waye fast dyd ronne, And saide: here cometh the furyous serpent Roberte, which ys I trowe a deuylls sonne, That in murther and myscheif hath a greate talent. Than forthe he rode to the churche dore, And discended from his horse right there. So he kneled downe in the floore, And to oure lorde god he made hys prayer, Sayinge: swete Jesu, that bought me dere, Haue mercy on me for that precyous bloude, That ran from your hearte with Longus speare, Which stonge youe in the side hangynge on the roode. Then vp he rose, and went to the Abbot, And sayde to hym with pitteouse lamentynge: I haue bene so symple, father, that ye well wot, That nowe I feare the sworde that ys lyghtly comynge Of our lordes vengeaunce for my false lyuynge. And of all that I haue offended vnto youe, Forgeue me for hys loue that was hangynge Seuen houres on the crosse, and there hys head dyd bowe. And when they hearde hym pitteouslye complayne, And in hys harde hearte [that he] toke repentaunce, The monckes all thereof were fayne. So there he tolde them all in substaunce, Howe he was in wyllynge to suffer pennaunce, And to Rome to take hys Journeye. So there he called to hys remembraunce Of hys lodge, and therof toke the abbot the keye. Thys keye to the Abbot there he toke, And tolde hym that he shoulde haue all the treasure In the theues lodge, yf that he woulde loke, That he had robbed synce the fyrst houre; And saide: my meynye lyen dead in the floore. The Abbot he prayed to geue hys father the keye: For I wyll not slepe one night, where I do another, Tyll I in Rome with the pope speke maye. And praye my father to make restytucyon For me to all them that I dyd offende. I crye hym mercy, also I am hys sonne, Hym for to myscheif also I dyd entende; But what thoughe nowe I trust to amende. There Robert toke hys leaue of all the hole couent; Hys horse and hys sworde he to hys father sende; And so departed, and on hys feete forthe wentte. Than rode the Abbot to the Duke of Normandye, And shewed of Robert all that was befall. There he delyuered vp the keye, And of hys entente he sheowid the Duke all. Then he hys men before hym dyd call, And sayde: I wyll ryde and restore the goodes agayne; And euery man hys owne haue shall. Then were the Dukes seruauntes all fayne. Nowe Robert walked ouer dale and hyll, By holte and heath, many a wery waye. He laboured night and daye euer styll; At the last he came to Rome on Sherethursdaye. All nyght poorely in the streate he laye, And on the good frydaye to churche he went ywis, Towardes the quyere, and nothynge dyd saye; For that daye the Pope sayed all the seruyce. The Popes seruauntes bade hym go backe; They smote Robert, and thrust hym asyde. Tho to hym self he sayde: oute alacke. Yet he thought boldlyer for to abyde; Where people were thynnest there he espyed. So prest amonge them, tyll he came to the pope, And fell downe to hys fete, and loude there he cryed. As rayne the teares fell fro hys eyes, god wotte. The popes seruauntes would haue pulled hym asyde. Oure holy father yet aunswered: naye, Medle not with hym, lett hym abyde, That I maye here what he dothe saye. Robert aunswered: I am here thys daye, The synfullest lyuer that euer was founde; Synce Adam was made in Canaan of claye, I am the greatest synner that lyued on grounde. The pope sayde: what art thou, good frende? And whye makest thoue thys lamentacon? Oh, good father, saide Robert, to god I haue offended I desyre youe to heare my confession, Of my greate synnes the abhomynacon. On them to muse yt ys vnnumerable; Vice and I rested all waye in one habytacion With murder and euery vnthryftye culpable. Art thou Robert the deuyll? sayde the pope than, That ys the worst creature of all the worlde yll. Yee, yee, syr, sayde Robert, I am the same man; Greate myscheyf haue I do, and muche yll; As to robbe and slea, both burne and kyll. The pope sayd: here in goddes name I thee warne, By uertue of hys passion stande here styll; Do to me nor my men no maner of harme. Naye, naye, sayde Robert, neuer chrysten man Wyll I hurte by night nor daye. The pope toke hym by the hande than, And bade hym hys confession to hym saye. Thereto Robert woulde not saye naye, But all hys synnes confessed and tolde. The pope, whan he hym hearde, dyd quake for fraye: For to heare hys synnes hys hearte waxed nye colde. And [he] tolde howe hys mother gaue hym to the feende of hell In the houre of hys fyrst contemplacyon. The pope sayd: Robert, I thee tell, Thou must go to an hermyte three miles withoute the towne. Robert sayde: with good will thys shalbe done. Then wente he to the popes goostlye father; The pope commaunded hym so to done, That the hermyte might hys confession heare. In the mornynge, Robert walked ouer hyll and dale; He was full werye of his labourynge. At the laste he came in to a greate vale, And founde [the] same hermyte standinge. He spake with the hermyte, and shewed of hys lyuynge; And tolde that he was sente fro the pope of Rome. But when that holy man hearde hys confession, He sayed: brother, ye be right wellcome; And for youre synnes euery one muste be sorye. For as yet I will not assoylle youe; In a lyttell chappell all nyght shall youe lye; Do ye as I do youe councell nowe. Aske god mercye, and let youre hearte bowe: For all thys nyght I wyll wake and praye Vnto our lorde, that I maye knowe, Yf in saluacion ye do stande in the waye. So they departed. The hermyte fell on slepe; An aungell sodenlye to hym dyd appeare, And saide: to Goddes commaundement take good kepe, And of Robertes pennaunce thou shalt heare. He muste counterfeyt a fole in all manere; The meate that he shall eate, he muste pull yt from a dogge, And neuer to speake, but as he dombe weare. Thys pennaunce done, he shalbe forgeuen of god. The hermyte with that shortlye dyd awake, And called Robert, and spaeke to hym; And saide: heare nowe the pennaunce that ye shall take. God commaundeth the to counterfet a foole in all thinge: Meate none to eate, withoute a dogge do yt brynge To the in hys mouth; then muste thou yt eate: No worde to speake, but as dombe euer beynge: With dogges euery nyght also thou must sleepe. The hermyte said: tyll thy synnes be forgeue, Thou must do as I haue here sayde; With thys sharpe pennaunce thou must lyue, Tyll god of hys debtes by the be payde. Forget not thys; in thy hearte let it be layde; At the last god wyll sende the worde agayne. Robert wepte as thoughe he shoulde haue dyed, And sayde: thys pennaunce will I do full fayne. The hermyte bade hym remember althynge: And whan thy synnes be cleane forgeuen the, By an Aungell god wyll sende the warnynge; Nowe maye thou no longer byde with me. Robert blessed the hermyte then trewlye. So eche toke theyr leaue of other; Nowe god [sayd Robert] for euer be wyth the. He sayd to Robert: nowe, farewell, brother. There poore Robert departed fro the hermyte, And blessed hym, and agayne went to Rome; For to do hys pennaunce in the strete. And whan that he thether was come, Lyke as he had ben a foole he dyd ronne, And lepte and daunced from one syde to another. Many folke laughed at hym soone, And wende he had ben a foole, they knew none other. Boyes folowed hym throughe the strete, Castynge styckes and stones at hym; And some with roddes hys bodye dyd beate; The chyldren made greate shoutes and cryenge. Burges of the cyttie at Robert laye laughynge Oute of theyr wyndowes, to se hym playe; The boyes threwe dyrte and myre at hym. Thus contynewed Robert manye a daye. Thus [when] he played the foole on a season, He came on a tyme to the Emperours Courte, And sawe that the gate stode all open; Robert ranne into the hall, and beganne to worke; So daunced and leapt [he,] and aboute so starte, At the laste the Emperoure had pyttie on hym, Howe he taere hys clothes, and gnew hys shyrte; And bade a seruaunte meate hym for to brynge. Thys seruaunte brought Robert plentye of meate, So proferde hyt hym, and saide, go dyne. Robert sate styll; he woulde not eate: Yet god wotte hys belly [had] greate pyne. At last themperoure sayde: yonder ys a hounde of myne; And bade hys seruaunte throwe hym a bone. So he dyd, and whan Robert yt had spyne: Alack, thought Robert, he shall not eate yt alone. He lept from the table, and with the dogge faught; And all for to haue the bone awaye; The hounde at the last by the fyngers hym caught, So styll in hys mowthe he kepte hys praye. Whan Robert sawe that, downe he laye: The dogge gnewe the one ende, and Robert the other; The Emperoure laughed, whan he that sawe, And sayde the dogge and he fought harde together. The Emperoure sawe that he was hongrye, And bade to throwe the dogge a hole loffe. Whan Robert sawe that, he was glad greatelye, For to lose hys parte he was right lothe, And agayne to the dogge he goeth. So brake the loffe a sonder, and to the hounde He gaue the one halfe, to saye the sothe, And eate the other, as the dogge dyd, on the grounde. The Emperoure saide: syth that I was borne, Sawe I neuer a more foole naturall, Nor suche an ydeot sawe I neuer beforne, That had leuer eate that, that to the dogge dyd fall, Rather then that that was proffered hym in the hall. Than Robert toke hys staffe, and smote at forme and stile; What sorowe was in hys hearte they knewe not [at] all; There men were gladde to see hym playe the foole. At the last Robert went into a garden, And there he founde a fayre fountayne. He was a thurst, and whan he had dronken, He wente in to hys dogge agayne; To folowe hym euer he was fayne. Thus vnder a stayre at nyght laye the hounde, And euer hys pennaunce Robert dyd not dysdayne; Allwaye hys bed was with the dogge on the grounde. Whan the Emperoure espyed hym lye there: Fett hym a bed, to a man dyd he saye, And lett yt be layed for hym under the stayre. So they dyd, and Robert poynted as naye; And woulde have them to beare the bed awaye. Then they fett hym an arme full of strawe, And therupon by hys dogge he laye. All men marueyled that yt sawe. Muche myrth and sporte he made euer amonge; And as the Emperoure was at dyner on a daye, A Jue sate at the borde, that greate r[en]owme longe In that house beare, and was receyued all waye. Than Roberte hys dogge toke in hys armes in faye, And touched the Jue, and he ouer hys sholder loked backe. Robert set the dogges ? to hys mowth without naye; Full soore the Emperoure loughe, whan he sawe that. Robert sawe a bryde that shoulde be maryed, And soone he toke her by the hande. So into a foule donge myxen he her caryed, And in the myre he let her stande. The Emperoure stode and behelde hym longe; At the last Robert toke a quycke Catte, And ranne into the kechyn amonge the thronge, And threwe her quycke into the beefe potte. Lordes and barons loughe, that they coulde not stande, To see hym make myrth withoute harme. They saide he was the meryest in all that lande. With that a messenger the Emperoure dyd warne That aboute rome was many a Sarasyne; And saide: the Seneschall hathe gathered a great armye; Because ye wyll not let your daughter haue hym, He purposeth all Rome for to dystroye. Thys Emperoure had a doughter that coulde not speake, The whiche the Seneschall loued as hys lyfe; And ofte with the Emperoure he dyd treate, For to haue her vnto hys wyfe. And for that cause the Seneschall made thys stryfe, Because the Emperoure in no wise woulde Geue hym hys doughter; he swere ofte sythe Maugre hys head wynne her he shoulde. The Emperoure heard of the Sarasyns that were come, For to dystroye theyr chrystyan Countrey. He made a crye in greate Rome, That younge and olde shoulde make readye, As manye as were betwene fyftene and sixtye. Lordes, barons and knyghtes drewe out of euery cost, With an houge companye and a myghtye; They thought for to fell the Sarasyns greate hoste. So forth withall bothe these hostes mette, Wyth weapons bright and stedes stronge. So with soore strokes together they sette; Theyr speares braste in peces longe. Many a doughtye [knyght] was slayne in that thronge; Greate horses stamped in yron wedes; Oure chrysten men were put to the wronge With woundes depen that full sore bledes. Oure lorde on hys seruauntes had compassion, And sent an Aungell with horse and armure Vnto Robert, as he dranke in the garden. There the Aungell bade hym arme hym sure, And saide: bestryde thys good stede that longe will endure; And in all haste go ryde, and helpe the Emperoure. Alacke, thought Robert, nede hath no cure. Than rode he forth the space of an houre. He rode into the thyckest of the fyelde, And hue and slewe of the Sarasyns a greate numbre. No steele nor harburgyn [was] that with hym helde; Hys dentes rouges as yt had ben thonder; He smote mennes bodyes cleane a sonder. Hys sworde made many a head to blede, That the Emperoure had greate wonder, What knyght yt was that he sawe so doughtye in dede. With the helpe of god and Robert that knyght, That daye the Sarasyns loste the fyelde; And whan that ended was that fyght, Euery man houered and behelde, Where that whyte knyght was that wepon dyd welde. But Robert wente into the garden, And layde downe bothe harnes and shylde. Yt vanyshed a waye; he wyst not where yt became. And all thys sawe the Emperours doughter: That the Aungell brought Robert the whyte stede, And howe at the welles syde he dyd of all hys armure; Therof she had greate maruayle in dede. At the last the Emperours men dyd of theyr wede, And came to dyner into theyr lordes hall. The Emperoure said: this daye Jesu dyd vs spede, And the white knyght fayre must hym befall. Than Robert came in, lyke a foole playinge, Into the hall, and leapte from place to place. The Emperoure was glad to se Robert daunsynge. Than he spyed a great race of bloude in Robertes face; But that he gate when he in the battayle was. The Emperoure wende that hys seruauntes had hurt hym so, And saide: there ys some rybaude in thys place, That hath hurte my Robert, that no harm can do. The Emperoure asked whether that whyte knyght was gone. Hys lordes aunswered: we can not saye. At the last hys doughter, that was bothe deafe and dombe, Euer she poynted to Robert allwaye. Her father wondred at her in good faye, And asked her mystres, what hys doughter ment. She said: she meaneth that Robert thys daye Holpe youe to wynne the fyelde with hys doughty dente. Her mystres said that Robertes greate bloudye race, Youre doughter meaneth he had it in the fyelde. At her wordes the Emperoure asshamed was, And waxed angrye; and that hys doughter behelde. He saide: thys folysh mayde thynketh he fought in the fielde. He bade her mestres teache her more better: For, and she will not wyser be in her elde, A foole shall she dye, there maye no man let her. Than the seconde tyme the Sarasins came to Rome, And with the Emperoure fought a sore fyelde. The Aungell agayne to Robert dyd come, And then he rode forth hys weapon to welde. He perisshed brestplates and many a shylde; He strooke of bothe legge and arme; The Emperoure that knyght agayne behelde; To watche for hym hys men he dyd warne. But he was gone, they wyst not whether. So on the morowe an other fyelde was pyght; The Emperoure charged euery man to do his endeuer, For to haue knowen that whyte knyght. So, on the morowe that they shoulde fyght, Syxe knyghtes laye in a woode preuelye and styll. They sayde: we wyll of that noble man haue a sight, And to our lorde brynge hym we wyll. On the morowe the sunne shone bright; Bothe partyes there was assembled; All the fyelde gaue a greate lyght Of the gleyues that glystred. The stedes trembled; A wonder [it was] to heare the brydles that gyngled. With arbelaters they shot many a quarell; All the grounde of the noyse rombled; Throughe the helpe of Robert, the Chrysten men sped well. That daye Robert proued hym doughtye of hande. Manye fro theyr horses downe he dyd shlynge; None was able hys dente for to with stande. There men myght heare greate rappes rynge; The noyse of gunnes made such a bellowynge, All the fyelde sowned as yt had ben thonder. Of bloude greate gutters they myght se runnynge, And many a knyghtes head clefte a sonder. All Sarasyns fled, the chrysten won the fyelde. Robert rode awaye than full pryuelye. The knyghtes in the wodde hym behelde, And lowde vnto hym beganne to crye: Syr knyght, speake with vs for thy courtesye. Robert thought not agayne to turne. The other knyghtes rode after hastelye, And smote theyr horses with spores, and after dyd runne. Roberte ranne ouer dale and hyll; Hys stede was good that he had there. A bolde knyght folowed after hym styll, And into the reste he threwe hys speare; So strongelye to Robert he hyt beare, To haue slayne hys horse, and smote hym in the thye. The speare head brast, and in hys legge bode there; Than was thys gentle knyght full soorye. Backe agayne rode than thys knyght so bolde, And shewed the Emperoure that he was gone agayne. There of hys speare heade he hym tolde: To see hym, quod the Emperoure, I woulde full fayne. Than throughe all hys lande he dyd proclayme, That he that woulde shewe the greate wounde with the speare head, Shoulde haue hys doughter, and not her layne, Vnto hys wyfe her for to wedde. When the Seneschall hearde the proclamacion, He made hymself a greate wounde throughe the thye; So gate a speare and whyte armoure soone, And so rode to the Emperoure with all hys meynye. And said: Syr Emperoure, that valyaunt knyght am I, That saued youe thre tymes fro grame. The Emperoure said to hym: thou art not lykelye, And bade hym holde hys peace for shame. At last the Seneschall shewed hym hys wounde, And said: beholde thys and the head of the speare. The Emperoure was abashed in that stounde; So there he gaue the Seneschall hys doughter: And on the morowe he shoulde be maryed vnto her. So was the Emperoure by hym beguyled; He wende verelye that he had ben there, And fought in the fielde as a knyght doughted. On the morowe thys greate weddynge shoulde be, That the Seneschall shoulde haue hys doughter. And so [they] brought her to churche, [and] the seruyce began ready. There by myrakle thys lady spake to her father, And saide: thys traytoure he hath beguyled youe here: For Robert was he that helpe you in the fyelde. I sawe an Aungell brynge hym bothe shylde and speare; With these two wordes downe on her knees she kneled. And the Emperoure whan he sawe hys daughter speake, For ioye he was nere oute of hys mynde, And thanked god for that myracle greate. Than the Seneschall with shame shranke behynde. So to the Pope the Emperoure dyd wynde; The mayde tolde the Pope what Robert had done, And brought them to the welle the speare head to fynde, And betwene two stones she espyed yt sone. Than went to seke Robert bothe lordes and ladyes greate; At the laste they founde hym lye[nge] vnder the stayre Amonge the dogges, and with them [he] dydde eate. They desyred hym to speake with wordes fayre; But he made signes as he coulde not heare. With that came an hermyte, &amp; toke hym by the sleue, Sent thether by god. He was hys goostlye father, And bade hym speake, sayinge hys synnes were forgaue. Yet was he afearde to speake, and durst not [his lippes ope]. The Emperoure prayed hym to se hys thye. Robert woulde not heare; but whan he sawe the Pope, He ranne and played hys tauntes about lyghtlye. The pope bade hym speake for the loue of Marye. Robert hym scorned, and gaue hym hys blessynge. He woulde not breake hys pennaunce, he had leuer dye. Then the hermyte bade hym speake, [saynge:] forgeuen is thy synne. With that Robert fell downe on hys knee, And thanked Jesu that forgaue hym hys myslyuynge. The pope and the Emperoure were glad trewlye, But most of all that ladye made reioysynge That was the Emperoures doughter, that yongelynge, Desyringe her father that she myght Robert wedde. For thy askynge, said he; I gyue the my blessynge; In all the haste, daughter, yt shalbe spedde. Than Robert maryed the Emperours doughter, A feast was holde of great solempnytie. Eche of them was full gladde of other; And at the last, when ended was thys ryaltye, He toke leaue of the Emperoure, and to hys owne countrey He yede: for the imp hys father was dead; Also a false knyght put hys mother in greate ieopardye, Whych Robert at the laste hynge by the headde. With hys mother he mette in the cyttye of Rome; The Duches was then glad and blythe, That Robert her sonne so vertuous was come home, Whiche in hys youthe lyued so myscheuous a lyfe. Than all men loued hym, both mayde and wyfe; Tyll it befell vpon a certayne daye, A messenger came from the Emperoure full swythe, And prayed hym to come to Rome in all the hast he maye. He tolde that the Seneschall had greate warre With hys lorde the Emperoure in dede. Robert sent after men nye and farre; In all the haste thether he gan spede. But ere he came, was done a myscheuous dede; The Seneschall the Emperoure had slayne. For sorowe Robertes hearte dyd blede; In fyelde he woulde haue fought full fayne. The Seneschall hearde that Robert was come, And purposed for to mete hym in the fyelde. He reared up many a black Sarason, With wepon stronge, bothe speare and shyelde. So ether partyes other behelde, And fought together a greate batteyll. There Robert with hys handes the Seneschall kylde, So to hys countrey returned without fayle. And whan he came agayne to Normandye, He dreade euer god, and kepte hys lawe; So lyued he full deuoutelye: For all thynge woulde he do vnder awe, And punyshe Rebelles both hange and drawe. Than was he called the seruaunte of god; No thefe woulde he saue, that he myght knowe, For dreade of goddes righteousnes the sharpe rodde. One chylde by the Emperours doughter he had, That was a knyght with Kinge charles of Fraunce. In manfull dedes he hys lyfe ladde; Doughty he was bothe with speare and launce. Lo, thy[s] Robert ended hys lyfe in pennaunce; And whan he dyed, hys soule went to heauen hye. Nowe all men beare these in remembraunce: He that lyueth well here, no euyll death shall dye. Yonge and olde, that delyteth to reade in storye, Yt shall youe styrre to uertuous lyuynge, And cause some to haue theyr memorye Of the paynes of hell, that ys euer durynge. By readynge bookes men knowe all thynge, That euer was done, and hereafter shallbe. Idlenes to myscheif many a one doth brynge, And specyally as we daylye may see. Take youe ensample of thys story olde, Howe that he in youth dyd greate vengeaunce; In doynge myscheife he was euer bolde, Tyll god sent to hym good remembraunce. And after that he toke suche repentaunce, That he was called the seruaunte of god by name, And so contynewed without varyaunce. God geue vs grace, that we may do the same. Here endeth the lyfe of Robert the Deuyll.</field>
