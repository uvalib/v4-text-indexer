      <field name="fulltext">Uni si possim, posse placere sat est. To his no little respected friend little Iohn Bvck, I dedicate this my little Booke. Ad Curiosum. And why the Mouse-trap, quoth my Caualyer? and looking further (saies) What haue we heere? Faith neither Phisicke, nor Philosophy, affected Proze, or learned Poesie, The home-spun russet, suteth some that weare it, and many braue it out, that ill may beare it: I neither treat of stout Themistocles, nor vse I choise or quaint Hiperboles; Onely vnfold by way of borrowed rime, some few fantasticke humors of our time: Wherein (if ought thats pleasing) may content thee take it: If not, suppose no harme was meant thee, and good inough. Epigram. 1. [Lvscus that once lay with his Mistresse maide] Lvscus that once lay with his Mistresse maide, And (fearing much to haue the matter knowen) Went to his fellow, whom he friendly praide, To counsell him, as were the case his owne: He that more cunning knew what should be done, Tooke this aduantage for his better speed. To finish that which th'other had begun; But then alas, she proou'd with child indeed: And made the Woodcock (who did first bewray it) Stand to the reckning, that could better pay it. 2. [Nisa, who from her window glaunst her eyes] Nisa, who from her window glaunst her eyes, saw Mopsus come, as fast as foote could trot: For ioy whereof, vpon her bed she lyes, (as who should thinke, she slept and saw him not.) 'Twas very strange, vnlesse she meant herein, Her eyes should not be open vnto sinne. 3. [When Cacus was accused of a rape] When Cacus was accused of a rape, for stealing secretly to his maids bed: He hardly could the doome of law escape, (had he not thus the matter coloured.) That tooke his oath (nor did he sweare amisse,) He went not to his maids bed, for 'twas his. 4. [Aske Ficus how his luck at Dicing goes] Aske Ficus how his luck at Dicing goes, Like to the Tide (saith he) it ebbes &amp; flowes: Then I suppose his chance cannot be good, for all men knowes, 'tis longer ebbe then flood. 5. [Young Codrus Land-lord to his fathers rents] Young Codrus Land-lord to his fathers rents, which happy time (long lookt for) doth expire, Addresseth him with these abilliments, as least beseemes the sonne of such a Sire. And thus he gallants it some yeare and more, Vntill his Tenants thrust him out of doore. 6. [A scoffing mate, passing along Cheap-side] A scoffing mate, passing along Cheap-side, incontinent a gallant Lasse espied: Whose tempting brests (as to the sale laid out,) incites this youngster thus to gin to flout. Lady (quoth he) is this flesh to be sold? no Lord (quoth she) for siluer nor for gold, But wherefore aske you? (and there made a stop) To buy (quoth he) if not? shut vp your shop. 7. [Brisco that gallant yongster keepes his bed] Brisco that gallant yongster keepes his bed, as faining to be sick, but (wot you why?) Not of an ague, or an aking head, no burning feauer, or French maladie. Tush, none of these can halfe so much molest him, As yonder flat-cap foole, that would arrest him. 8. [Iesu how strange you make it Mistresse Iane] Iesu how strange you make it Mistresse Iane, Will you not know your quondam tried friends? Remember since you lodg'd in Pudding lane; Shall former kindnesse merit no amends? I say no more: well may you change your name, But once a whore, you should be still the same. 9. [Mounsier Flemingo, fraught with Angels store] Mounsier Flemingo, fraught with Angels store, Would see faire London, neuer seene before: Where (lodging with his Mistresse but one night,) had (ere he parted) put them all to flight. 10. [Fine Mistresse Delia defies the man] Fine Mistresse Delia defies the man, That proffers lesse to her then golden fees: What, thinke you her some common Curtizan, That will her credit or her custome leese? In faith sir no: But ere you shall go hence, She will for once, accept of eighteene pence. 11. [Brutus, that braue and compleat Caualier] Brutus, that braue and compleat Caualier, Who thus of late in Fleet-street flourished: Thought then no pleasure or expence too deare, But see how soone the case is altered. As that constrained to diuide the streete, He now betakes himselfe vnto the Fleete. 12. [Madam Rugosa knowes not where to finde] Madam Rugosa knowes not where to finde, one chamber-maid of ten, that likes her minde But still my Lord (on proofe of comely charge) Prefers them to his Seruing-men in mariage. 13. [The times are waxen dead with Dalila] The times are waxen dead with Dalila, who (since the Terme) hath had but little sturring, Then was he sought-to more then Helena, And Gallants gallopt then in Coaches hurring. But now she speakes with all that please to call, Loe thus her trade doth Termely rise and fall. 14. [Faunus for feates of Fencing beares the Bell.] Faunus for feates of Fencing beares the Bell. for skill in musick on each instrument: For dancing, caruing, and discoursing well, with other sundry gifts more excellent. But striuing still to make his credit stronger, The Taylor will not trust him any longer. 15. [Lawrence hath lou'd his Mistris full seauen yeare] Lawrence hath lou'd his Mistris full seauen yeare, (seru'd her I should say) yet nere durst come neere So much as kisse her gloue, or tye her shooe, Thinke you your Mistris (Lawrence) should you woe? 16. [I pray Sir, did you note on Sunday last] I pray Sir, did you note on Sunday last, how richly Rubin was apparrelled? Well may he be compared to a blast, or lik'd to one that's metamorphised. For on next morning (ere the day did dawne,) All that he wore, and more, was laid to pawne. 17. [What meaneth Rosamond to walke so late] What meaneth Rosamond to walke so late, when no man can decerne her face or feature: (But by her habit may preiudicate,) she is some faire, or rather famous Creature. Oh good Sir, vnderstand that in the darke, One man of twenty may mistake the marke. 18. [I asked Brusus, why he takes that paines] I asked Brusus, why he takes that paines, To trot in Terme time for so little gaines: His answer was, that such as stand on wooings, must howsoeuer, seeme to haue some dooings. 19. [Lorellos wife is lately brought a bed] Lorellos wife is lately brought a bed, (as luck would haue it) of a goodly boy: The hopefull issue of her maiden-head, And onely Iewell of the fathers ioy. Well (God forgiue them that may thinke amisse,) But sure as death, the Child is none of his. 20. [Tvsh hang it: haue at all (sayes Curio,)] Tvsh hang it: haue at all (sayes Curio,) Comes not deuce ace, assoone as six &amp; three? Who would not rather, halfe his lands forgo, Then be out dar'd, by such a one as he. But thus he speakes (his father scant yet cold,) And neuer meanes to liue, till he be old. 21. [Soto is lately gone to Sturbridge faire] Soto is lately gone to Sturbridge faire, whose little takings, makes the Gull dispaire: 'Twere good some friend of his, would tel the Mome his wife hath had takings inough at home. 22. [How comes it, Druso liues vnmaried] How comes it, Druso liues vnmaried, that whilome was a sutor to so many; Alack, his loue hath still miscarried, And he (misled) was neuer lou'd of any. I doubt the griefe of such remembrance past, Will cause the Cockscombe hang himselfe at last. 23. [How like you little Dol in her deepe ruffe] How like you little Dol in her deepe ruffe, seemes she not now as proper as the best? You thinke you may command her: marry muffe? she scornes the motion: fough that were a iest. Because she sold her wares so cheape of late: Must they be alwayes prised at that rate? 24. [This makes Menalcas muse aboue the rest] This makes Menalcas muse aboue the rest, to see how quaint my Lady is adrest: For from the girdle vpwards (durst he sweare,) she doth the shape of very man appeare. 25. [Gallus that greatest Roost-cock in the rout] Gallus that greatest Roost-cock in the rout, swelleth as big as Bacchus did with Wine: Like to a Hulke, he beares himselfe about, and bristels as a Boare, or Porpentine. 'Tis not his locks that makes him looke so big, For all men knowes he weares a Periwig. 26. [Now fie vpon thee Coward Nemius] Now fie vpon thee Coward Nemius, that oft hast puld thy Ladies stockings on: Yet still wert bashfull, not so venturous, as scarce so much, her legge to looke vpon. Who comes so neare faire game, and lets it passe, (At least vnproou'd) approues himselfe an Asse. 27. [Young Lady Flora, when she first did wed] Young Lady Flora, when she first did wed, was then but carelesse of her Husbands bed: Which want of yeares made her esteeme as light, yet with her Seruing-man would daunce all night. 28. [Tis strange to see, how pure, precise, and neat] Tis strange to see, how pure, precise, and neat, Rufinus walketh in his ruffe-set band: Who will (forsooth) no flesh on Fridayes eate, but still on nice and curious points doth stand. Aske him wherefore, he giues you ghostly reason, But then his whore comes neuer out of season. 29. [Gvydo hath goodly lodgings that he lets] Gvydo hath goodly lodgings that he lets, to Gentlewomen of the better sort: Nor careth he how little gaine he gets, so they approued be of good report. But still he lights vpon some lawlesse Trull, That by her sleights Guydo is made a gull. 30. [Would any deeme Dacus were now the man] Would any deeme Dacus were now the man, who was not worth of late a wooden Can? Doubtlesse his skill in something doth surpasse, but his Red nose is still the same it was. 31. [I wonder when our Poets will forbeare] I wonder when our Poets will forbeare, to write gainst Citizens their honest wiues: Who (though vnknowne to me) yet durst I sweare, they neuer wronged man in all their liues. Put case their husbands pocket (you know what) Must they on Stages needs be pointed at? 32. [Perswade not Romulus to take a wife] Perswade not Romulus to take a wife, who is to wedlock sworne an enemie: And euer vowes to lead a single life, which he accoumpts most honest purity. Besides a thousand reasons that constraines him, Amongst the rest a Marchants wife maintaines him. 33. [Damon his Dick hath not these three yeares seene] Damon his Dick hath not these three yeares seene, nor knoweth where he hath concealed beene: Was it not strange, that they so iumpe should meet, both at a bawdy house in Turnebull-street? 34. [I cry you mercy sir, I knew you not] I cry you mercy sir, I knew you not, thus Courtly Metamorphised of late: The Country questionlesse hath you forgot, you braue it out with that maiestick state. As (but I now recall whose sonne you were) You might haue passed for some Nobles heyre. 35. [Pontus is posting hetherwards apace] Pontus is posting hetherwards apace, to dine with diuers that in Fleetstreet meetes him, But see the lucklesse chance of such a case, assoone as he alights, the Sergeant greets him, So that the burthen he should haue defraid, Was wholy now, vpon mine Hostesse laid. 36. [Rvfus is wondrous rich, but what of that?] Rvfus is wondrous rich, but what of that? he liues obscurely like a water Rat: And his apparell, which he seldome buies, are such as Houns-dich and Long-lane supplies. 37. [Mistresse Finetta, for her ready witte] Mistresse Finetta, for her ready witte, is much admired, and belou'd of many: But this one fault of hers confoundeth it, she will deride, and iesting scoffe at any. Which by an ill accustom'd vse comes on her, And yet ther's one that playes as much vpon her. 38. [Mounsier Montanus is no little man] Mounsier Montanus is no little man, of vnaprooued valour to his foe: Perswade, or wooe him, with what words you can, heele be reuenged, all the world must know. But when he found one with his wife in bed, For feare, or shame, he durst not shew his head. 39. [Celso but newly wedded, doth repent] Celso but newly wedded, doth repent, and meanes to be diuorst incontinent: Alas (poore Celso) knewst thou not before, she euer was, and will be still a (?) 40. [A knot of Knaues are early met together] A knot of Knaues are early met together, consulting where to breake their fast that day: Each well prepared, said no matter whether, for none amongst them had wherewith to pay. At length an honest gull, that knew them not, Came in by chance, and needs would pay the shot. 41. [Cvtbert our Cobler can no more forbeare] Cvtbert our Cobler can no more forbeare, to take Tobacco, then to liue vnknowne: He drinkes all whiffes at least, and learnes to sweare, by Heauens: his othes and humors are his owne. But adding herevnto a pot or more, He stands to nothing which he spake before, 42. [Clitus with clients is well customed] Clitus with clients is well customed, that hath the lawes but little studied: No matter Clitus (so they bring thee fees) how ill the Case, and thy aduise agrees. 43. [Fie, would you offer Wynifrid that wrong] Fie, would you offer Wynifrid that wrong, as to attempt her Virgin chastitie? Well wotteth she, you cannot loue her long, and (which is worse) the world may it espie. Which (once reuealed) she wete quite vndone, And yet at length chaste Wynifride was wone. 44. [Philo is wondrous iealous of his wife] Philo is wondrous iealous of his wife, and vrgeth termes of shrewd suspition: But knowes not him the causer of his strife, yet will he yeeld to no condition. For more he vexed is that knowes it not, Then if you horne him to his face God wot. 45. [Sisley and Kate are gone to frollick it] Sisley and Kate are gone to frollick it, late in the euening with their Tom and Kit, What luck had they to buy their sport so deere, that in the morning must haue whipping cheere. 46. [Svch were those Epigrams of elder times] Svch were those Epigrams of elder times, done by that rare and matchlesse Martiall: As whats now written, are but idle rimes, (compar'd to him) that did surpasse them all. Not Virgil, Homer, Horace, Iuuenal, Nor all the rest were like to Martial. 47.
