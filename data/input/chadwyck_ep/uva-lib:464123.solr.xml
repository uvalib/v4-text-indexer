Flie soule vnto thy rest. Seauen times a daie vvill I praie to thee o god, and vvill praise thee o lord for thy great gifts, and good graces, both to me, and mine Psalm CXIX. When the spright of m? doth sighe, and sob to god, and is lift vp on highe, the spright of god doth bovve it selfe to man in ioy, and peace. CYPRIAN. To his much esteemed good frend Mr. IOHN POWELL one of the assistants of the worthy c?panie of the Marchants Aduenturers residing at Hamborough. Grace, peace, &amp; mercie be multiplied in Christ Iesu. The first straine. 1 Lord heare my suite, my plainte, That my soule makes to thee. Lord in thy truth one looke of grace Grant in thy loue to me. 2 Lord see the moane I make, Looke on me in thy grace Let not my sighes come backe in vaine But shewe to me thy face, 3 Loe I was borne in sinne, My kind, my shape, my all, My stocke, my flocke, my selfe from birth O Lord from thee did fall. 4 And I poore soule am sett In greefe, in paine, in woe, My sinnes come on, my soule doth faint, O quitt me of my foe. 5 My sinnes the haires doe passe That are set on my head, My hart doth feare, and faint, and faile And I am as one dead. 6 Thus goe I greeud, and goord, And frett in hart, and spright Thus am I faint vvith feare, &amp; death My sinnes they doe me fright. 7 The deeds that I haue done Are sett in vevve of eie. My faults, my thoughts, my sinne my shame Thy lavves thy lookes doe spie. 1. Sighe. O that my thoughts, vvords, vvorkes and vvaies vvere made so straight, and right, that I might keepe thy lavves of lord all the daies, &amp; nights of my vvhole life so should I be clere, &amp; cleane from the guilt of sinne, &amp; shame. The second straine. 1 O God if thou shouldst vvaighe My vvaies, and take a vevve, I could not scape thy rod, thy vvrath I should in vvoe it rue. 2 O iudge me not I pray, O sheeld me from my fall, For in thy sight none iust doth liue No none I say at all. 3 Large is thy loue to me, For it vvith thee I treate O grant me it for Christ his sake Gainst sinnes so huge, so great. 4 O Christ vvhat vvight doth knovve? His sinne, &amp; faults of life O cleanse me from my sinnes at once Which are in me most rife. 5 And keepe me lord I craue Least sinnes doe ore me svvay, So shall I then be free, and faine, To keepe thy lavve for aie. 6 This lord of thee I beg To thee I hold vp hands, And hart, &amp; soule, both thirst, &amp; gape As doth the drought in lands. 7 As maids doe vvatch, and vvaite, On Queenes some grace to haue So doe I lord both day, and night For grace both beg, and craue. 2. Sighe. O that there vvere such an hart in me to feare thee, &amp; to keepe all thy lavves that it might goe vvell vvith me &amp; mine for aye. The third straine. 1 Lord turne thee to thy grace That once thou shewedst to me O saue me not for my good acts I seeke, I sue to thee. 2 My soule vvhy dost thou faint? And art vvith greefe soe prest? My hart, my mind, vvhy doe you thus Fret sore vvithin my brest. 3 Trust soule to god for aye, And thou the time shalt see When thou shalt thinke, &amp; thanke him still For health, &amp; peace to thee. 4 For vvhy his vvrath doth last, A space, and then doth slacke But in his face, &amp; grace for aye, Thou canst not ioy long lacke. 5 Though gripes, and greefes full sore Doe lodge vvith thee all night Yet ioy, and grace shal be at hand Ere that the day be light. 6 The lord is kind, and meeke When vve doe make him greeue, He is full slovve his vvrath to shevv, Great grace he doth vs giue. 7 And loe vvhat loue good men To their ovvne seede doe beare, Like grace the lord doth shevve to such As searue him in his feare. 3. Sighe. O that I had vvings like a doue (my svvete loue) that I might fly hence to thee, &amp; so be at rest both in mind, in thought, in hart, in soule, and in mine vvhole. The fourth straine. 1 The lord that made me knovves My shape my mould my lust Hovve vveake, hovve vaine, hovve fraile, hovve fond, And that I am but dust. 2 O god in me set vp A pure hart in thy sight, And eke in all my parts let be A good, and meeke svveete spright 3 With thy svveete spright of povver Cure thou o lord my sore, And I shall teach the good, and ill To bovve to thy svvete lore. 4 My soule doth pant, and bray Mine hart is neere at rest But seekes to knovve thy lavve thy vvill, And vvhat may please thee best. 5 O vvould it might thee please My vvaies to sett in right That I might both in hart, and deed. Thy lavves to keepe in sight. 6 O lord I doe tend still My daies, my time to serue That I, nor mi? may haue a thought From thy lavves once to svverue 7 O saue me then o god, Looke on me vvith thy health For that I rate at such a price More th? the vvide vvorlds wealth 4. Sighe. O let the vvords of my mouth, the thoughts of my hart, the tune of my voice, &amp; touch of my tongue be euer in thy sight o lord as a svveet smell for Christ his sake both at morne, Eue, &amp; none daye. The fift straine. 1 With ioy lord of the Iust Let my poore soule be fraught That I may liue in peace, and glee, And free from all thats naught 2 Lord keepe me for in thee I stay, and stand and feed Thou art my god, and of my goods O lord thou hast noe need 3 I giue them to the Saincts That in the vvorld doe dvvell Yea to the folke of faith, and loue Whose care is to doe vvell. 4 My hart is prest for aye, And eke my tongue is soe I vvill raise vp my soule in song In spight of hell, and foe. 5 To praise my god that hath Shevvd loue and life to me, And made me scape both bloud, &amp; blovve And soe did sett me free. 6 O lord vvhat shall I pay To thee for this thy grace I vovve to thee, my selfe, my life My loue, and all my race. 7 Grant lord I beg, and pray In thee that vve may rest So shall our soules sing to thy praise And aye in thee be blest. 5. Sighe. O my god vvhy art thou gone from me, and vvhy dost thou hide thy svveete face from my prayer for seeke thee, &amp; sue to thee vvith all my hart, and that thou knovvst full vvell. The sixt straine. 1 My soule giue praise to god My spright shall doe the same, And all the parts of hart, and mind Shall praise for aye his name 2 Giue thankes for all his gifts Shevv soule thy selfe most kind, And let not his good deeds to thee Once slipp out of thy mind 3 He quitt thee of thy faults He rid thy life from death His good, his grace doth vvaite on thee His vvord doth giue thee breath 4 If thou vvert brought to graue, And turnd to mould, &amp; dust Yet he vvill giue thee life in store As he to thee is iust. 5 Teach me then, lord to knovve Thy lavve, thy loue, thy lore, Thy vvorkes, thy vvords, as signes, seals Ile lay them vp in store 6 O day of ioy to me When I learnd first to knovve Hovve for to scape my selfe, my sinne And hell that is soe lovve 7 I giue mine all to thee, My bud my branch, my fruite I beg of thee, o lord, my god To grant to me my suite. 6. Sighe. O my god to thy hands I giue my spright thou hast bine a pledge for me and that to death o god. Thou art [illeg.] the god both of my health, life, &amp; rest for aye. The seuenth straine. 1 O Lord thou hast me tride, And day by day dost knovve My thoughts, my vvords, my lookes my deeds, My sighs, my groans, my vvoe. 2 My bones they are not hid Thou knevvst them all each one For in thy note they vvere all vvrote Each ioynt, and bone, by bone, 3 Trie still, and search mine hart, My thoughts proue day, &amp; night And if the ill doe touch me lord O leade me to the right. 4 For thou canst rule my raines As vvhen I vvas in vvombe. O giude me in this life of mine, And rest me in my tombe. 5 Keepe me from men that muse Of bloud of bane of ill, O let me thinke of thee o lord, And hovve to doe thy vvill. 6 So shall noe shame me taynt My corps, my goods, my name So shall I rest in ioy, and peace, And touch noe blot of shame 7 So shall thy folke for me, Be glad, and sing thy praise, So shall my selfe, my seed, my solue Be thine in all my daies. 7. Sighe. O let not my suite come in vaine to thee, but heare o my god, and say to my soule I am, and vvill be thy asse from hell, thy port from the sea of this vvorld, and vvill bring thee to the bay of blisse. A months minde. To Thinke on death, &amp; muse on the graue, that the feare of death may not be fierce vvhen Christ shall call vs out of this vvorld &amp; is to be song in the tune of. I sayd I vvill looke to my vvaie Psalm XXXIX. O death I vvill be thy death (saith Christ) for he is the death of death, the death of sinne, the life of man, &amp; the breath of god for man to liue there in vvorld vvith out end. Hamborough Januarij 24. 1620. To his much respected good frend Mr. THOMAS BARKER one of the assistants of the worthy c?panie of the Marchants Aduenturers residing at Hamborough. The blessing of both vvorlds in Christ Iesus. The first muse. 1 O eare soule thou hast thought of thy end And novve muse on the vvay, The first part is a life vvell spent, The last is deaths doomes day. 2 Shall I call that the vvay of vvoe By vvhich vve passe to blisse? O sure there is noe vvay but that To bring me vvhere Christ is. 3 And vvhat is death novve dost thou thinke? But dovvne vvith all the stickes, Of vvhich this earth, &amp; tent of ours Is made, that gainst god kickes. 4 Death is the farevvell of old frends, Till they meete to be blest, Death is the iudge to quitt fr? iayle, The soule that longs for rest. 5 Death makes the corps of clay to sleep But vvakes the soule to see, Death payes the debte, &amp; teares the bone And all to sett thee free. 6 There is a death of deaths my soule The death of hell, and vvoe, But Christ his death hath payd for that His vvord doth tell thee soe. 7 O Christ my soule doth thinke on thee And thankes thee day, and night That thou hast rid me fr? this death By thy great povver, and might. 1. Thought. Thy Christ o soule hath set them free vvho through feare of death vvere all their life time in bonds and thrall. Heb. 2. 15. The second muse. 1 O muse my soule sith thou art safe, Get home ene to thy rest, For god to praise in songs, &amp; psalmes I hold it for the best. 2 My soule hovve canst thou feare to goe In stepps vvhere Christ hath bine; He hath to graue led thee the vvay O then leaue of to sinne. 3 For hire of sinne is death, and graue To death are deepe fell vvayes; There needs noe kinues, noe cords, noe svvords, It comes on nights, and dayes. 4 One by a slatt, a flye, a grape, One by a bit of meate One by the ayre, a flovver, a thorne Comes to his doome so great. 5 Why then my soule feare not this death, The sting of it is lost The bed of graue is svveete, and safe Through Christ his care, &amp; cost. 6 Our sinne made death our foe at last Our frend Christ hath it made; By death vve pass the port of rest When all things else doe fade. 7 What if this giude doe lead my corps Through graue both darke &amp; fell? Whiles at that tyme my soule doth liue And vvith my Christ doth dvvell. 2. Thought. O my soule ioy, &amp; be glad for thy Christ hath made thee say to death, o death vvhere is thy death, o graue vvhere is thy povver. 1. Cor. 15. 55. The third muse. 1 What if my frends doe mourne for me And sobb, and sigh in moane; What if my seed doe crie, and roare, And greeue, and vvaile, and grone? 2 This vvhile my soule sees him that vvas Once dead but novve doth liue, And that for aye my Christ in god, My lord that life doth giue. 3 What care I vvho doth shutt mine eies Wh? death doth make me see As I am seene of god in Christ And then vvith him shall be. 4 What if my life the vvorld doe not Set out in vvords of fame Whiles I liue vvith the god of life What care I for the same. 5 If death shovvld still be foe to me He harmes but my vvorst part, My best part farre out of his reach Scornes both his ruth, and dart. 6 And more then this my corps once dead Feeles noe more sting of death, But then my soule is free, and liues In god by Christ his breath. 7 Novve then my soule sith thou dost beare Tvvo things vvrapt vp in breast Lett each part turne, and goe, &amp; see His seate, his scite, his rest. 3. Thought. O god they that dvvelt in a darke place by thee haue seene the light, &amp; they that vvalkt in the shade of death thou hast brought them to the light vvith great ioy, &amp; peace. Esay. 9. 2. The fourth muse. 1 Shrinke not deare soule at sight of death Nor faint thou at gods call Hovve oft hast thou hard bells to passe For frends, for foes, for all. 2 Hovve oft hast thou the sicke bede seene Of vvights in woe most rife Hovve oft haue things bine done to death And all to giue thee life. 3 And canst thou hope that some vvay else For thee is made in sence Wh? kings, &amp; Prests, &amp; rich, &amp; poore And all must thus goe hence 4 Passe on my soule, &amp; sing, &amp; ioy In god that makes the graue, A place for thee to pass to bliss And knovves vvhat thou vvouldst haue. 5 Hovve oft hast thou seene eies fall closed And heard by dint of svvord Hovve oft vaine men in field haue fought In fence of a vaine vvord 6 What th? novve dost thou feare my soule The stage of death is bed, And graue that rests our bones in peace That here on earth haue fed 7 Let them feare death vvhose hart, &amp; mind Is more sicke th? their face Hovve canst thou feare since novve thy Christ Hath shed his bloud for grace. 4.

The fift muse. 1 What losse is this svveet soule to loose This corps this flesh, this skinn? When thou shalt vvinn thy god in Christ, Thy selfe fred from thy sinn. 2 When thou shalt see the soules the Saincts In ioy, in rest, in blisse Wh? thou this vvorld a sea of sinne A sinke, a stye, shalt misse? 3 Of change most blest for thee to knovve To rid thee of these raggs, And thy selfe clad in robes of state In spight of death his brags. 4 This skin, this shame, this dust, this dung, This earth, this mire, this clay Shall shine as sunne in raies of rest When thou shalt see that day. 5 Thine eies that vvere full sad to see Thine oft, and ill done deeds; Shall then see Christ still in thy sight Where grace, &amp; good still feeds. 6 These eares that heare the ruth &amp; rage Of tongue, as hott as hell; Shall then the voice of Christ still heare And saincts vvith him that dvvell. 7 And th? this tongue that novv doth plains Of greefe, of vvoe, of gall Shall tune a part in that svveet quire With Christ, vvith saincts, vvith all. 5. Thought. O my soule thy Christ hath tooke part vvith flesh, &amp; bloud, that by death he might beate dovvne him that had the povver of death. Heb. 2. 14. The sixt muse. 1 Novve vvhat is death th? say my soule Ist not a sleepe in graue? They that did feele the vvorst of it The stile of sleepe it gaue. 2 And aske thy corps, o my svveet soule Wh? full vvith toyle of day, If it hath not bine glad to rest As cloyd vvith a foule vvay. 3 And novve in this svveete sleepe of death Thou art sure to be blest Why like a child vvilt thou not goe To this thy bed thy rest? 4 Didst thou ere see a bird in cage, Sitt still vvith in the grate? That might flie foorth to vvoods, to groues To meete his loue, his mate? 5 Did Paule vvhen god his gyues had burst And rid him out of iayle? Crie out, &amp; say, not yet o lord I doe not like this bayle. 6 Paule slepte tvvixt tvvo that did him keepe But vvh? that he vvas free And rid fr? iayle did he once turne To iayle those bonds to see. 7 O my svveete soule didst ere thou see At sea men sing their songs? And vvh? to l?d they c?e did greeue And tell their frends of vvrongs. 6. Thought. O heare me o lord, my god, &amp; giue light to mine eies least I sleepe the sleep of death. Psal. 30. 3. The seuenth muse. 1 Hast thou o soule no mind to rest In all thy paine, and toyle? But vvilt thou still goe on, &amp; drudge By lott on sea, on soyle. 2 Hovve oft haue vvights in vvoe, &amp; greefe Bought death to ease their paine Hath death found thee, &amp; vvilt thou not To goe from greefe be faine 3 Doth name of death the fright my soule What if m? call sleepe death Wilt thou be fraid to close thine eies Or feare to loose thy breath. 4 What hurt vvill c?e to thee by that The first man vvas in sleepe Wh? god a vvife made him for helpe The man in ioy to keepe. 5 And vvhat if novve thy god for [illeg.] Whilst thou dost sleepe in [illeg.] Doth make thy soule a spouse to [illeg.] His face, his grace to haue[illeg.] 6 My death o soule but parts the fr?ds That each hath led the vvay, And novve shake hands but for a space Till meete in rest thy may. 7 Goe then my soule to this sure gaine Part vvith a frend a space The tyme vvill come vvhen this dust Shall see thy Christ his face. 7.

The eight muse. 1 Tell me my soule vvas thou not loth At first to ioyne vvith me? Why novve art loth to part vvith that, Which much vvoe letts thee see. 2 Dost thou not heare the vvise to say, The day of death is cheefe; And is more good then day of birth Which brings thee vvoe, &amp; greefe, 3 Dost not thou trust the vvise mans vvords On throne in state in glee, That thus did say of death, &amp; birth Then harke thou once to me. 4 The lord of life that knevve deaths force Doth say that they are blest That die in god, our lord, our Christ And from their vvoes haue rest. 5 O death hovve svveete is that thy rest To vvights in vale of teares Hovve svveete is thy grim face to those That liue in vvoe, &amp; feares? 6 O soule vvhat man is so fell mad, And so in soule cast dovvne? To hide himselfe in base things here To loose by them a crovvne 7 My soule then see, &amp; say in fine With men of gods ovvne lore. For me to die it is more good Then liue on this ville shore. 8. Thought. O my soule if by one mans sinne death did raigne by one, much more they vvhich haue much grace, &amp; the gift of faith shall raigne in life by one Christ my lord and god. Rom. 5. 17. The ninth muse. 1 What ayles thee o my soule, my deare, Such face, such feare to shevve? Novve death doe come to cite thee home Is all thy faith, but devve 2 Is death soe fearce, soe fell, to eies, To thoughts that vvas soe free; It is a shame to thee my soule Thou dost noe more Christ see. 3 Where is thy faith? in vvords thou couldst Call oft for death in life Is all but talke? is all but smoke? Where is thy hope so rife? 4 Hath thy svveete Christ novv sent for thee And art thou loth to goe? Rouze vp thy selfe for shame o soule And doe not serue him soe. 5 O lord raise vp this hart of mine That faints, &amp; droopes in death O that J might thy cup once tast, And liue in thy svveete breath. 6 The spright vvould come, but flesh is vveake Lord helpe this guest of thine, And rid her from this flesh of sinne Which is a broode of mine. 7 I come to thee, o lord I come Streach forth thine hand to me, O death, o graue vvhere is thy sting? My crovvne, my god I see. 9. Thought. They are blest that haue a part in the first life for on such the last death shall haue noe strength but they shal be preests of god, and of Christ. Apoc. 20. 6.

The spouse speakes. 5 And though this vaile of my base flesh A full sight bares me fro, Yet vvith mine eye of faith, I looke On him that loues me soe. 6 I see him as in a cleare glasse, I see him shine full bright; Through grates of vvords, &amp; gates of life My soule of him hath sight. 7 And novve me thinkes I heare him speake And thus to me doth say O church, o spouse lift vp thy head O faire one come thy vvay. The seuenth Song.

Christ speakes. 5 O all ye that vvishe vvell to me, And to my church, &amp; name Put fr? my deere all those that seeke Her faith, her loue to blame. The spouse speakes. 6 For he is mine by faith, &amp; trust, And I am his by loue. We both are one by his great power I long to see my doue. 7 O come as svvift as Roe, or Hind My loue, my life to me Till day doe breake, till sunne doe shine Till shade of death doth flee.

The third speach. The church speakes still. 1 The men that should haue had a care They smote, &amp; did me vvound, With vvords most false, &amp; vaine they sought, To ding me to the ground. 2 I charge you all that loue the lord If that you shall him find Tell him hovve sicke I am of loue In hart, in soule, in mind. 3 O vvhat (say they) is this thy Deere More then the sonnes of men That thou art thus farre g? in loue, And aye doe not him ken. 4 My loue sayd I is vvhite, &amp; red His face is pure, &amp; bright He is the cheefe, &amp; choice, of all In him is all the light The church speakes still. 5 For god in him is full, &amp; faire In grace, in face, in all.

Christ speaketh to his church. 5 So that their paines are not in vaine They bring to me much fruit. They cry, &amp; call to me for helpe, And I doe heare their suite. 6 Thy locks, thy lookes, are seene so faire Thy blush, thy smile so svveet.

And is set to the tune of I lift mine hart to thee. Psal. XXV. To his much esteemed good frend Mr. IOHN GREENWELL on of the Assistants of the most vvorthy companie of marchants-Adventurers residing at Hamb: All ioy, &amp; happines in Christ. The first depth. 1 I am the man o lord Haue felt thy vvrath, thy rod O send me helpe in this my vvoe My lord, my Christ, my god. 2 Thy stormes, &amp; clouds of ire Doe beate me day, &amp; night Thou shevvst me vvoe, &amp; vvast, &amp; warre And hidst from me the light. 3 All the day long o lord Thine hand is turnd gainst me Noe helpe, noe hope, noe ioy, noe mirth That I poore vvretch can see. 5 My flesh, &amp; skin are vile, And parcht as in a drought, My bones, my hart are broke in tvvayne This lord thy vvrath hath vvrought 6 O lord thou makst a fort With me to vvarre, &amp; fight With gall; &amp; greefe thou dost me fill And none vvill doe me right. 7 As they that long are dead, And cleane cast out of mind So am I sett in night of death With vvoe, &amp; greefe all pind! The second depth. 1 An hedge is pight me round To close me in this vvoe I can not stirre thy chaines me bind O lord vvhat shall I doe? 2 And vvhen I cry, &amp; roare In all my greefe, &amp; gall He shutts me out, &amp; vvill not heare Ne cares he for my call. 3 He ramzes me in so fast. With stones, &amp; clay full thicke My pathes he crokes, &amp; giues noe ease My soule is faint, &amp; sicke. 4 As beares doe teare their pray, And vvaite more bloud to spill So hath my foes me rent, &amp; torne As if it vvere thy vvill. 6 I peece, by peece am hald, And puld by hand to raggs I by my selfe do sitt, &amp; vveepe, While my foe sitts, &amp; braggs. 7 Thy bovve o lord is bent, To shoote at my pale face I am a marke for shafts to hitt O yett shevve me some grace. The third depth. 1 For see the shafts doe sticke In all my raynes through out I am the butt, &amp; none but I At vvhich shootes all the rout. 2 My foes make me their iest And song by night, &amp; day Where is thy god, thy lord, thy helpe Thus they to me doe say. 3 Mine hart is fraught vvith gall, My bloud is drunke vp still With shame, &amp; greefe I vvaile, &amp; vvast Make hast me lord to kill 4 My strength is dasht, my teeth Are broke vvith in my head Thou laist on loade on me poore soule I vvish I vvere cleane dead. 5 My soule doth not once heare Of peace, of grace, of light I cannot call to mind my state That once I had in sight. 6 O lord my strength, my hope, My helpe I looke from thee. But all is gone, &amp; there is none That cares, nor lookes to me. The fourth depth. 1 O call to mind svveet god This moane, this woe of mine This gall, this greefe, this plaint, this cry For I o lord am thine 2 My soule is faint, &amp; failes When I to mind doe call My greefe hath made me cry, and roare To see my vvoe, &amp; fall. 3 Yet haue I hope in thee That thou vvilt helpe at last, &amp; vvilt not quite my soule for aye From thy svveet sight out cast. 4 It is thy loue o lord That I am not quite sold, And rid from earth, both braunch &amp; roote And closd vp in the mold. 5 Thou failst me not in morne, All night I feele thy stay, Thy hand is great, &amp; in thy truth Thou hearst vvhat I doe say. 6 For thou o lord art mine My soule doth hope in thee Thou art my lot, my land, my rent Once more lord sett me free The fift depth. 1 O thou art good o lord To them that vvayte, &amp; tend To soules that seeke, &amp; sue to thee Thou dost thy grace dovvne send 2 It is right good o lord To hope for helpe from thee For of thee lord is all mans good O shevve thy smile to me. 3 It is full good for man In youth to beare thy rod For he shall learne there by to knovve The lord to be his god. 4 Then sitts he pale, &amp; vvan, And mute vvith out a peeare He will take heede all tymes that he Doe searue the lord in feare 5 And if he see theres hope His mouth from dust vvill cry, And to the lord make plaint, &amp; moane To day that he doth dye. 6 He giues his cheeke to such As smite him, &amp; doe taunt He vvil not giue his eare to those That vaine &amp; vile things chaunt. The sixt depth. 1 The lord doth not for aye Cast of his choice of men But though they greeue yet in his tyme. He takes them from that den. 2 For by his vvill the lord Greeues not his flocke at all Nor doth he crush the sonnes of m? When they on him doe call. 3 He rights men in their ill. The face of the most high Is sett to helpe the flocke of Christ Yea he vvill dravve them nigh. 4 Out of gods ovvne svveet mouth Comes forth not good, &amp; ill When vve are plagud it is our sinne That doth our deare soules kill. 5 Let vs then search our vvaies, And turne to our good god So shall he quite put farre from vs His scourge, his plague, his rod. 6 Lift vp both hand, &amp; hart To him that dvvells on highe And shevve our sinns, our shame to him Least that for them vve dye. The seuenth depth. 1 Thou hast vs slayne o lord And hidst vs vvith a cloud O that our sute comes not to thee Though vve doe cry full loud 2 We are as drosse, and doung, Our foes doe on vs rage [illeg.] feare, &amp; snare is come on vs, And that from age, to age. 3 Mine eies cease not to vveepe But day, by daye vve moane Till thou o lord dost looke from high, &amp; ease vs of our grone. 4 My eies, and hart doe ake, The one vvith teares doth runne My hart it sobbs, &amp; sighes full sore For that vvhich I haue done. 5 Men chase me like a bird, They haue cut of my life They cast great stones to keepe me dovvne They kill me in their strife. 6 Yet from these depths o lord I haue cald on thy name Thou to my voice vvilt giue an ear And ease me of the same. The eigth depth. 1 Thou vvontst to say, Feare not, Thou vvontst my cause to plead And to the streames of loue, &amp; life Thou vvast vvont me to lead. 2 O lord my vvronge thou seest Judge thou my cause vvith those. That gape, &amp; hope to eate me vp With rage they doe me close 3 Thou lord hast hard their cries Hovve they doe rage, &amp; roare Hovve they doe spite, &amp; spitt at me And raue still more, &amp; more. 4 They make their songs on me They iest, &amp; gibe, &amp; mocke When they sitt dovvne, or rise, or walke They flout, they feare thy flocke. 5 Giue them their lott o lord, Looke on the vvorke they vvrought Giue them thy curse vvith greefe of hart That haue my vvoe thus sought 6 Cast them all cleane from thee Let not the earth them beare For that they doe not seeke to thee But rage vvith out all feare. A Metaphrase. Of the fourth, and fift Chapters of Ieremies Lamentations for the sacking, &amp; burning of Ierusalem, and the temple, by Nebuchadnezer king of Babell, and by Nebuzaradan the captaine of his gard, put into monosyllables of great Brittains language. And is set to the tune of I lift mine hart to thee. Psal. XXV. To his much esteemed good frend Mr. JOHN STAMPE, marchant one of the c?panie of the Merchants Adventurers residing at Hamborough. Eternall blisse in Christ Iesus. The first depth 1 Hovve is our gold so dymme? The fine gold hovve ist lost? The stones of the lords house are vvast This is our case, our cost. 2 Our sonnes that vvere so strong Are trod as clay in streete, And as the potts so are they broke They crush th? vvith their feete. 3 The formes of fish in sea, That are most strange to see Yea they to young ones yeald their breasts with vs this may not bee. 4 The babe that suckes is drye, For bread the young ones cry, But bread, &amp; breast they can haue none And so they faint, &amp; dye. 5 They that did feede most fine The crusts most course vvould haue, They that put on their robs of silke The pigs coote seekes, &amp; craue. 6 The vvoe that vve doe bere Is farre more great then vvhen our god did rayne fell fire fr? skey, And burnt the sonnes of men. The second depth. 1 They that vvere pure as snovve, And vvhite as is the milke That lookt so red, so fresh, so faire, And clad them selues vvith silke. 2 They are as blacke as cole, By face they are not knowne; Their skin is parcht, &amp; cleaues to bones They vvaile, they vveepe, they moane. 3 They vvhom the svvord doth kill We count in a good case, For they that liue doe pine for vvant, Both they, &amp; all their race. 4 The babes that sucke the breast We seeth for meat in pott, Or else vve pine for vvant of meat Our limbs doe fade, &amp; rott. 5 The lord is vvrath vvith vs, On vs he shoures his ire, And vve are cleane out out of sight He burnes vs vp vvith fire. 6 The kings of all the earth Doe stand in maze to see. Our foes march in our streats vvith routs, &amp; vve poore soules to flee The third depth. 1 But this is come to vs For that vve shed the bloud Of such as vvere most neere to god, And shevvd vs all the good, 2 The bloud I say of them Doth cry gainst vs to god, And novve vve feele his hand of ire His scourge, his vvhipe, his rod. 3 This bloud of men so iust, Hath bine our bane, our vvoe, And made vs turne our backes fr? such As made them selues our foe. 4 For vve card not for Preeste. Nor those that did vs good, But vvere both ferce, &amp; fell to them We stroue to sheed their bloud. 5 For this our eies doe vvatch, And vvaite, &amp; still doe faile. No helpe, noe hand is strecht to vs, And so vve faint, &amp; quaile. 6 The foe doth hunt our stepps As vve goe in the streete They kill, they cry, they roare on vs They tread vs vvith their feete The fourth depth. 1 They hunt vs in the feilds On hills in dales they kill We dare not once loke out of dore Our streats vvith dead they fill. 2 The breath of all our liues Is caught fast in their snare, And left he is in plight full ill, Both base, &amp; poore, &amp; bare. 3 Let these be glad that dvvell Farre of out of this place Take heede least you doe moue the lord. Gainst you to turne his face. 4 For he hath plagud vs sore For all our sinnes, &amp; ill, And yet vve hope he vvill loke back And cease our folke to kill. The V. Cap.5 O lord call thou to mind What is come on vs all Take heede to vs that in our vvoe To none but thee doe call. 6 Our lands, our rents, our all The foe from vs doe take. The folke that are to vs most strange A prey of vs doe make. The fift depth. 1 Our babes doe knovve noe sires, And they that gaue the breast Doe sitt, and sighe, &amp; roare, &amp; cry, Ne can they take their rest. 2 Our drinke to vs is sold, Our vvood vve buy full deare, And all this ill is come on vs For thee vve did not feare. 3 Our neckes are prest vvith yokes On vs they lie full sore. We moile, &amp; toyle, &amp; haue noe rest O lord vvhat vvilt thou more 4 To those that be our foes For bread vve giue our hands They tire on vs, &amp; make a prey, They breake in to our lands. 5 They that are dead, &amp; gone, O lord haue done the sinne, And vve poore soules doe pay the price. These take vs in their gin. 6 Base slaues vvhom vve did beate, Ore vs novve rule, and tire, &amp; there is none that doth vs helpe Our feete stickes in the mire. The sixt depth. 1 Our bread vve gett vvith dread, It costs vs halfe our life we vvaile in midst of vvoe, &amp; waste All night, all day in strife. 2 Our skin like to a Moore Is black for vvant of meate Our parts are parcht to skin, and bone Thy vvrath o lord is great. 3 Our maids they make a prey To serue their minds, &amp; lusts Our vviues they vvronge in all our sights, Yet lord thy hand is iust. 4 By hand our prince they hang, The old men they doe scorne Our greete doth last till it be night, And eke till it be morne. 4 They make our young ones grind And toyle like horse in mill. Their backes they load vvith bath of vvood Till that they doe them kill. 5 The old men sitt noe more To iudge the cause in gate The young m? vvaile that vvont to sing Oh vvhen vvill be our date 6 Our ioy of hart is gone Our daunce is turnd to moane our minds doe muse of nought but vvoe We sitt, &amp; sighe, &amp; grone. The seauenth depth. 1 The crovvne is gone from vs, And all the rule is fled, What shall vve doe o lord our god Our sinne hath struck vs dead. 2 For sinne our hart is faynt, For sinne our eies are dymme, For sinne our foes doe vvarre on vs, And rend vs limbe, by limbe. 3 Our hills, and dales are vvaste The foxe doe roome, &amp; range, These things to see our harts doe bleed, To vs it is most strange. 4 Yet lord thou art for aye, Thy throne is sett full sure Thou canst vs helpe, vvhen hope is gone O lord novve doe vs cure. 5 Why then dost hide thy face? And vvilt not on vs looke Thou vvilt at last thy grace vs giue That is vvrote in thy booke. 6 Turne to vs lord vve praye, And then vve shall see grace, O giue to vs the daies of old, Thy name sett in this place. 7 What shall thy vvrath like fire Still last, and burne, &amp; kill O cease svveet lord vve doe thee pray So shalt thou find noe ill. Seauen dumpes On the seauen words that Christ spake on the crosse which shevve the seauen depthes of the lavves curse, vvhich our lord did feele for our sinnes. And is set to the tune of I lift mine hart to thee. Psal. XXV. To his much esteemed good frend Mr. GEORGE FRANKLYN on of the Assistants of the most vvorthy companie of marchants-Adventurers residing at Hamb: Grace here, Glory hereafter in Christ. The vevve 1 O god my soule lift vp, &amp; stretch mine hart in tvvaine That it may feele, &amp; faile, &amp; die For life is in this paine. 2 My poore hart is so full, &amp; fraught vvith thought of thee That its nighe rent to see thy loue So much, so maine for me 3 O take thy crosse, and nailes, And straine my hart at length That thy deare loue may not be pent, But shevve my soule thy strength 4 And novve my thoughts are free Thy loue to vevve in sight My hart doth pant for that noe more It feeles here of thy might 5 O fill my hart once more, And stretch, &amp; straine it still That I may lothe, &amp; loue no more My sinne that brought this ill. 6 But I vvant space in hart, And grace in all my life, To end my smart in sight of this, And sinnes that are so rife. 7 But since my hart o god Holds not a sight of thee O doe thou lord hold fast my hart And shevve thy loue to me. The first Dumpe. On the first word. Father forgiue them for they knovve not vvhat they doe. Luck 23. verse 34. 1 What voice is this so shrill, That so?ds thus in mine eare O put from them their sinns o god That knovves not vvhats thy feare. 2 Is not thy voice o Christ? On crosse vvhen thou didst hang, And eke for those that did thee kill Ist not thy voice that sang? 3 A tune to god on highe, With vvhich his eare vvas pleasd, To see thy deere loue stretch so farre &amp; made the vvorld so easd. 4 They knevve not vvhat they did Was ere such a thing seene. To pray for those that made a prey In vvoes so sharp so keene. 5 O soule full oft thou hast Not knovven vvhat thou hast done Noe vvay for helpe to cure that greefe But in thy Christ gods sonne. 6 O pray my soule for them That hate thee to the graue, And let not vvrath lodg vvith thee once Its Christ that must thee saue. 7 When foes doe curse, blesse them For Christ hath taught thee so; who prayd for such as did him kill And brought to curse, &amp; vvoe. The next dumpe. ON THE NEXT WORD. Verily I say vnto thee, This day shalt thou be vvith me in paradice. Luck. 23. v. 43. 1 O soule looke vp to this, And harke vvhat voice thou hearst, Thy Christ in midst of gripes of death Doth heare, vvhat ist thou fearst? 2 Then sure he vvill thee heare, And giue eare to thy crye, Novve that he sitts on throne in state &amp; is thy god so nighe 3 A theefe doth cry, &amp; call, Christ heares him by, and by O soule thy Christ vvill heare thee sure If thou dost call, &amp; cry 4 O learne it is but one To vvhom Christ grants an eare That sued to him in death at last, And sought him in his feare. 5 Yet it is one my soule Least thou shouldst faynt, &amp; dye, And that thy Christ vvould not thee heare In death vvhen thou shalt cry. 6 And yet it is but one, Least soule thou shouldst be proud, And thinke that god vvould heare thee still When that thy cry is loud 7 O learne svveet soule by this To sue to god in life, &amp; driue not of till death doe come To die in iarre, &amp; strife. The third Dumpe. On the third word. Behold thy mother, Behold thy sonne. John. 19. v. 26. 27 1 See soule if ere the like Was hard that novve is seene. That Christ should care in midst of death, And greefes that vvere so keene. 2 For those that could not helpe, But savve him in that plight. Burst soule, and die to see his loue To her that bare his might. 3 And eke to him vvhose Ioue Was fixt sure in his breast That Christ should care in midst of greefe That he should liue in rest 4 She that vvhose seede did bruse The head of hell, &amp; death Hath hart all prest vvith vvoe, and greefe To see Christ lose his breath 5 O child see that thou loue, And loke, and long for good To those that haue thee borne, &amp; bred, &amp; are thee nighe in bloud. 6 Shall not our Christ loue those Thinke you, that searue him still, And haue a care of all such folke That seeke to doe his vvill? 7 My soule they are all deare He cares for all their seede, Ne shall there one that serues our god Be void of his full meede. The fourth dumpe. ON THE FOURTH WORD. My god, my god vvhy hast thou forsaken me? Mat. 27. Vers. 46. 1 O novve my soule giue eare To this great cry, and yell. That shakes the heauens, &amp; moues the earth And teares the povvers of hell. 2 My god, my god cries Christ Why putts thou me thee fro, And vvhy, dost hide thy face fr? me As if I vvere thy foe. 3 O soule he cries for thee That thou maist haue gods light, And nere be cast in pit full lovve, And hid out of his sight. 4 This cry did darke the sunne In full smyle of its beames O soule doth not it dymme thy sight, And cause of teares full streames? 5 My soule great is our sinnes That causd these groanes, &amp; cries My eares that heare, are dull, and deafe. My hart it faynts, &amp; dies. 6 What paine didst thou o Christ For me base vvretch then beare That thou didst yell, &amp; cry, &amp; roare In such great greefe, &amp; feare. 7 Wast not that I might nere Feele god goe from my hart? Wast not o Christ that I might not Of hell once feele the smart? The fift dumpe. On the fift word. I thirst.
