      <field name="fulltext">To the Reader. Gentle Reader, A good mind be thy leader: And then so led, Be thou with contentment fed. An honest loue, Doth me, thus to writing moue: Accept, and then VVell rewarded is my pen. But pleas'd, if not Equally, deuide the lot. Indeed my Muse, A blunt souldiers-words doth vse. Here, in this booke, Do for Popish VVonders looke. A slocke of Dawes, Gaping skip, at painted strawes. And Æsops Asse, Creates greatly, wondrous Grasse. A little Child With wonders, great fooles beguild. These, thousands more, Are the ragges of Popish store. VVhat I haue done, Thus doth to thy iudgement ronne. And I am still Thy good friend, and euer will. That in thy hart, To God, and King, faithfull art. Thus thine euer, Or else neuer. R. P. The Jesuits Miracles. Svch honest minds as do desire to laugh, When idle fools their foolish parts do play: Let them herein peruse that broken staffe, Where on proud Rome her shartered hopes doth lay. And smiling then, say thus, time happen shall, And that ere long when Dagon downe must fall. The Sea of Rome, growne to so low an ebbe, To raise her fall doth vainly shifts deuise: The Pope to spin his spitefull Spiders webbe. Mainetaines a doctrine, diuellish teaching lies For when on his proud head destruction comes, For helpelesse helpe, to miracles he runs. Great Brittons I'le, when on her fruitfull brest, Hell breathed forth corruptions poysoned slime; And bloudy Romes adherents did their best. To make their hellish hopes aloft to clime: When at their top of height heauen them so cheks, That helborne Climers breake their traytrous necks. Then of that troope Cerberus their captaine chiefe, Whose counsell did each secret ill direct, False traytor Garnet that soule murthering thiefe, His treason did each treasons plot protect, Vpon his trust did damned sinne relie, With hope to bring to passe, Arch villanie. When God was pleas'd at last to bring to light, That twentie yeares concealed close kept deuell: Who for the Pope with ctaft and greatest might, Had closely wrought in framing workes of euill. When Iustice him, most iustly did surprise, Marke on his part, what hell did thus deuise. Finding himselfe, with danger round beset, He standing still, men say, that thus he sayd: In Gods name come, my life shall pay the debt. Which must I know, to God by death be payd, Inforcest, he then himselfe did humbly yeeld: Whose deadly poyson, would the world haue kild. But where his right foote firmely fixed was, In beaten path, hard, smooth and boordlike plaine: Euen in that place, this wonder came to passe: A wondrous grasse sprang forth (a lie) certaine, Twelue inches long, two broad, and then, and there, That Grasse was seene (most false) three crowns to beare. From hence it comes, our Papists vainely thinke, That triple Crowned grasse did plainely show, Though holy Garnet, chanced then to sinke, The Pope should yet, to mightie greatnesse grow. For Garnets death had force his cause to nourish, And by his death, Romes sea should freshly flourish. Who so beleeues this Popish bold facest lie, That's grounded on, suppos'd admired Grasse, May fatly feed, his follies foolerie: Yet liue indeed, a very leane fed Asse, But falshood doth, such thrid-bare stuffe compound, As that thereby, it doth it selfe confound. This forged tale, may tell as I consider, The scarlet whore, of bloud-desiring Rome, Her pompeous pride, like scatterd grasse shall wither: And to destructions iudgement, shortly come, And that in Brittons famous Monarchie, In Garnets fall, Rome downe cast, falne doth lie. But more then this, by him did strangely hap, For aye to crowne his painted vertues name, Oh wondrous was his threefold crowned cap: His substance was, the child of shamelesse fame, His life, and death, in very Popish troth, Did bring admired lying wonders forth. For when he died, oh thing most strange to tell, To a Taylors wife, a scipping silkmans beares, A straw whereof, bloud from a traytor fell. She thereon weepes, ruthfull deuotions teares, To sight thereof she then her husband brings, And ouer it, a mournefull durge he sings. This holy rellicke, whilst (they say) she kept, Some craftier knaue, then her poore plaine goseman: To see that straw, deuoutly stealing crept. And well to search each part thereof began, At last whil'st he, to looke himselfe inclines, Behold forsooth, a miracle he finds. For (though not) in the inward huske or rine, Garnets dead face (at London bridge) appeares, This wonder proues he was indeed diuelline. And all his workes, for treason doubtlesse cleares, Some Popish painter cunningly did trace, On Garnets straw, false Garnets trayterous face. But would you runne, that strange made straw to see, And not for truth a Popish lie beleeue: It's gone to Rome, there safely kept to be. The Pope must weare it on his golden sleeue, But zeales hot fire, wisely to asswage, Let fooles trudge to it, in paultring pilgramage. False as themselues, this lie by them is coynd, They'le first picke strawes, ere lying wonders loose, Deceit haue they, with falshood falsly ioyn'd: Lies to maintaine, they brasen lies must choose, To force beliefe, by falshoods forsworne prate, Papists dare boldly wrong, both Prince and State. Let Pope, and Papists, close together ioyne, Falsly to paint, a Popish painted grace, Let still their wits, false truthlesse wonders coyne: By painting strawes, with traytor Garnets face, And let them lie, with flintie impudence, In hell is placest, their certaine recumpence. Garnet misnam'd, of Iesus order hight, A Iesuit knowne, and Iesuit fiercely they, Gainst Iesus Christ, do with proud boldnesse fight. And striue on earth, heavens blessed Saints to slay, All Popish Iesuits seeming saintie, Doth chiefly worke vild treasons villanie. Garnet their Martyr, whom they please to paint, Him onely for a painted martyr take, He was euen such a martyr, as a Saint. Such Saints, and Martyrs, Popes haue power to make: He dies no Saint, whose death maintaines a lie, Nor are they Martyrs, that for treason die. But Garnet dead, he for his treason died, False was his heart, desiring guiltlesse bloud, Equiuocations force his cunning tried. Thereby to make his hel-borne actions good: Fondly thinke not, for him strange strawes to see, Not worth a straw, such patcht vp wonders be. But her's the iest, new strawes are painted now, As if thereon two faithlesse faces stood: Rightly to paint the painter well knew how, For Garnet had two faces in one hood: Equiuocation his double face did cloake, Equiuocating himselfe at last did choake. Pope, Cardinals, Papists, blush all with shame, To see your Iesuits lying shamelesse drift, By miracle to crowne a traytors name: With martyrdome and by so vild a shift, Painting a fruitlesse straw, the worst of things, Dirisions scorne, such painted wonder brings. They paint themselues, and what their church is made, With straw they build their painted wals about: Heauens fruitfull wheate they blasted in the blade. Their corne is chaffe lifes ioyce themselves stampe out, They and their Church, though painted faire we know, Like Garnets straw is fruitlesse but in show. Pope like he hath himselfe and friends betrayed, With painted food feeding delusions ioy, His fatlings some, euen in their strength decayed, So such destroyers shall themselues destroy: Their painted straw may for Romes Emblems serue, On painted fruit who feedes shall feeding sterue. So are they fed, so they desire to feed, With painted zeale, and painted holinesse, From Popish schooles, such feeders do proceed. Let those soule killers not to Albian presse, Traytors they come, vild treasons to compound, For which when hang'd, then are they Martyrs crown Let but a Bird, or silly butter flie, Chance to come neere the slead, or Gallowes when A Popish Priest, or Iesuit comes to die, And straight by fooles, it is reported then, The holy Ghost, such likenesse vndertooke, Thereby on martyred, crowned Saints to looke. And may they so be euer comforted, That seeke on earth, heauens kingdome to destroy, When they to death for sinne are iustly led: Let vaine conceits confirme their faithlesse ioy, Such as do breath a Traytors loathed breath, Be all their comfort in vntimely death. But now the tale which strangely doth begild, Amazed minds, or vaine, or faithlesse weake: Oh a most strange surnam'd inspired child. Hath power to heale before he right can speake, His infant birth, a rowling Cradle shakes, Yet if but toucht, sicke, haile, lame, sound he makes. From Popish parents, springs this inchanted bud, Romes faith alone workes mightie miracles, Sathans proud Popes haue boldly oft withstood: The firme layd truth of sacred Oracles, Be that Religion rightly diuellish scand, Whose strength must now by working wonders stand. Shall by a child more wonder now be wrought, Then was by Christ the worlds redeemer done, Shall misbeliefe (as if no truth were taught) Teach vs (from God) for witch-like helpe to runne, We know Christ did not in his infancie, Do any one thing miraculously. But now that miracles are fully seast, Shall such be wrought as Christ himselfe exceeds: Let Rome alone such lothsome stuffe disgest. Whose poysned maw vpon damnation feeds, Negromancie, witchcraft, inchantments, socerie, Adores proud Romes most dam'd hypocresie. For treason, murther, theft, a Papist dying, If at his death he crosse himselfe and say, His faith is on Romes holy Church relying. And wils for him true Catholiks to pray, He dies a Martyr that to speake be bold, For so his name shall be at Rome inrold. Parsons the Iesuit in his house at Rome, Hath in a gallerie gallantly set forth, Such as in England suffred martyrdome: Who first had vowed themselues to Rome by oath, Each traytor hang'd, hangs for a martyr there, But Parsons chiefe, I would he chiefly were. When he from England entertain'd a friend, Then must they both amidst those martyrs walke, And when their conference had retain'd an end, Then Parsons he would thus begin to talke, Behold deere friend these shrines angelicall, Of martyrs crown'd with ioyes Celestiall. As at some motion then the foole begins, And to a Picture doth directly Point, Saith he an angell his sweet requiem sings, And for a Martyr doth his soule annoint, So much by him was holy Rome vphild, As for Romes sake he would his Queene haue kild. That happie Martyr died on such a day, At such a place in England hang'd was he, But at his death report doth truely say, That all the people did this wonder see, For when imboweld to his fames renowne, He with his foote did strike the hangman downe. Vpon that text then doth he preaching say, That wonder did vnto the world declare, They downe should fall and all their strength decay. That dirst themselues against Romes holiest beare, But heare his lye against him selfe is borne, Romes foes shall fall, Rome first in peeces torne, Then doeth he shewe a man or woman such, As did some Priest or Iesuit entertaine, And of their cause expostulating much, Saith that these Martyrs were in England slaine, Their death was ioy no griefe their minds could moue, They died because they holy men did loue. There was in them no lesse perfection left, Then in those Traytors whom their house did shroud, Themselues are theeues that but conceale a theft, Law iustly hath that truth for iust allowd, They traytors are that Traytors do conceale, Or hide them vp and not their names reueale. But Parsons he blacke treasons lector reads, Of all those Martyrs and their noble deeds, And his good friend from each to other leads. His eares with monstrous mountaine lies he feeds, Telling of wonders and most wondrous lie, Saith all liued saints, and all did Martyrs die. And last of all to Campions face he comes, And saith, looke here, this halloweg shrine behold, His deere remembrance euery sense benums. Whose praise deserues a booke with leaues of gold, This this, saith he, my lifes associate was, His life had brought a wondrovs worke to passe. We labored both for Englands happiest weale, To holy Rome that kingdomes rule to turne, We sought her wounds with blessed grace to heale. So did our loue in loues affection burne, We Princes drew to passe the Ocians surge, Our land from sinne by force of armes to purge. But in our worke whil'st we a strength prepard, To entertaine Romes Catholike defence, When for the good of soules we chiefly card. Then was disclos'd our Christian iust pretence, Holy Campion by heretiks was taken, Who had he liued their greatest strength had shaken. That learned Father lodged in Londons Tower, Though wanting bookes and libertie of mind, Yet was in him such force of holy power. As to dispute poore England could not find, Sufficient Clarkes his learning to repell, In him there did such heauenly iudgement dwell. But England turnd a tyrant to her owne, In peeces cut her star-bright natiue glory, But Campion is a sacred martyr knowne. Fame to the world proclaimes his fames true storie, The night before that blessed martyr died, By heauenly vision was he glorified. Lo what a coile a cunning traytor makes, Both treason and a traytors shame to hide, See with what boldnes he himselfe betakes, For treasons safetie strongly to prouide, But he that thus in Campions praise hath lied, Would God he had with Traytor Campion died. When Campion did with Reuerent Fulke dispute, Then Campions Errors were approued lies, In euerie point Fulke did Romes Pope confute. In spight of all that Campion could deuise, Our learned Fulke did arguments contriue, Whereby he did to Non plus Campion driue. Though Traytor Campion did for Treason die, Yet Campion can his vice for vertue praise, And paint him with a Martyrs sayntitie, For gainst his Queene he sought a power to raise, Strange Martyrs they must strangely be commended, Who iustly were for Traytors vild condemned. But Parsons thus when he hath forg'd his tale, And told the fame of all his Martyrs dead, Then doeth he rownd his falshoods speech impale, With monstrous lyes not to be numbered, For then he doth with protestations tell, What Plauges vnto those Martyrs foes befell, Some at the bar which did those saints accuse, By sodaine death were plauged for their sinne, Some hangd themselues, and with such fearfull muse, He doth afresh his prechiue lies beginne, And in that curse his impudence is such, As falsly he will noble States men tuch, His slander dares both Kinges and Queenes abuse, Aliue or dead his lies haue no respect, He doeth but as Popes, Pristes and Iesuits vse, By vildest meanes Romes glory to erect, And to that end the Rowling lyes he tels, His greatest worke which wonder most excels. He can conclude each point with wonders great, Done by or for those Martyrs by him nam'd, Or how for them iudgement their foes did beate, Worst, wonders prays'd, the beet had wondrous shame, Thus would he speake, that those to whom he spake, He might there by such holy martyrs make. I would that Parsons were in England here, Thankes to receiue for all his loues good will, That he in state might worthily appeare. Climing the top of antient Holborne hill, He euer did, and doth deserue the best, Of all those Martyrs whom himselfe hath drest. But now to Rome is Garnets picture runne, And mongst those Martyrs claimes the chiefest place, For at his death there was a wonder done. A straw did him and Romes Religion grace: When strangers come that picture strange to see, Amongst the best it most ador'd must be. Thus Iesuits can hels sulfer smoke perfume, And make the sent of damned Treason sweet, Popes and Iesuits dare diuellishly presume, To make a diuell for heauens saluation meete, Traytors indued with Romes most gratious spirit, Must after death the name of Martyrs merit. Popes two and twentie vild ones at the least, Haue vs'd abhorred nigromanticke spels, By which is plaine the most accursed beast. Euen in the throne of truthlesse Popedome dwels, For Antichrist he must by Sathans skill, The world with monstrouslying wonders fill. With fierie signes and coniuring wonders great, Popes often haue amazed minds dismayed, Mens soules haue their most wicked Papall seate. With seeming holy (but hellish) power betrayed, Pope Hell brand he, the People made beleeue, That burning fire came sparkling forth his sleeue. Such Popes indeed might with strange fire deale, Whose soules were sould to euer flaming hell, Themselues did from themselues saluation steale. Chosing with Diuels in endles flames to dwell, Loue not wonders that are by Sathan wrought, So Popes themselues and frindes to hell haue brought, Romes Legendarie is with Legions fild, Of lying tales soules banefull trecherie, Those mountaine lyes are in their strength vphild, Whose strife is to maintaine Romes Papacie, Rome will be great in spight of aduerse Fate, For why Romes friend the Diuill vpholds Romes state. By miracles with hell Rome shaking hands, Aproues Romes strength is doubtles wondrous weake, For sinnes foundation euer weakly stands. And vengeance must such force in sunder breake, The Pope enragd, wrath working Martiall toyle, Shall Rome reward with her destructions spoyle. Then let vs ioy that Papists vainely flie, To such like fond and childish shifts as these, The Pope doth now vpon his deathbed lie. Let not his physicke faithfull Christians please, And though that name he proudly vs denies, Faith boldly yet dares tell the Pope he lies. We liue in Christ saluations only meanes, Worlds all sufficient sauing Sauiour, Popes idly ground, their faith on faithlesse dreames. Denying Christ his glories glorious power, No soule (saith Rome) Christs death doth make so pure, But that besides it must a fire endure. Blasphemously Romes hellish doctrine speakes, Popes purgatorie for their bellies built, In them the frame of their redemption breakes. And leaues their soule staind with damnations guilt, He in his heart Christs death and passion hates, That from Christs death the glorie derogates. The soule by Christ made cleane true Christians know, Is roab'd in Christ his heauenly righteousnesse, And made as white as is the new driuen snow. That gloriously it doth appeare spotlesse, Christs precious bloud, of soules the only cure, Doth make the soule all glorious perfect pure. But if the Pope in shew no Christian seem'd, Christians then, would not to him repaire, Nor could he be a mediator deem'd, Betwixt the Dragon and our sinnes dispaire, But when the world did him earths holiest name, His craft vnseene brake downe saluations frame. The Pope when he had cast Romes Emperor downe, And to himselfe worlds mightie Empire tooke, Then Antichrist aduanst his triple Crowne. And proudly did ouer all earths Princes looke, The Pope growne great this subtill course he takes, His turne to serue religious forme he makes. Aboue Gods Church the Pope himselfe instals, No Church alowing but his proper owne, From Gods Church then Romes Church on sudden fals, Christes Kingly power lesse then the Popes was growne, Meditators being ioynde with Christ then he, Seem'd by the Pope, a Sipher made to be. For whilste the Pope such power vindicates, Vnto himselfe, that can pardon sins, And that a sainte, or Angell meditates, Twixt God and vs, and to vs saftie brings, Christ is thereby made for vs sinfull men, No mediator, nor redeemer then. See how the Pope doth Iesus Christ confesse, When as he doth his sauing power deny, What is the Pope then a plaine Athiest lesse, And what Romes sea, but hellish Blasphemie, Oh then let Popes not rule the Church of God, They and their Church is Sathans Sinagouge, The heathens they had gods for euery thing, And Papists haue for euery thing their Saint, Proud Popes when they do Papall Massis sing. But Pagan Panisme thereby smoothly paints, Heathens one Ioue, Papists one God they feare, But gods and saints they serue with equall share. Deare country men borne in great Brittaines Ile, Do not your blessed soules contaminate, With Babels slime flie from corruptions soile. For Romes great whore is earths adulterate, Gainst her and all her vild adulterates hath, Heauens mightie God denounst consuming wrath. Popes when they cursse do proudly cast from high, Their eursed firie flaming torches downe, Their insolence would tell the world thereby. Gods burning wrath doth waight vpon their frowne, But thus by God their daring pride is scoft, Wraths fire on them is powred from a loft. Romes sea in which heauen ruled all these Popes, Full twentie two, detested coniurers, Eight Athiests knowne weare hallowed golden Copes, And twentie three were vildest whore maisters, A eleuen Sodomites, Pope Ione a whore they call, Murtherers some, but wondrous bloudie all. As those Popes did, so euery Pope doth take, A course alike to selfe same onely end, That to the Pope, Romes ruling power might make. The world and all worlds Princes humbly bend, This to obtaine by euery horred euill, Popes chuse to serue worlds mightie Prince the diuell. The Pope a wolfe cloath'd like an humble lambe, As Christ his Vickar, claimes his greatest power, That Dragon Pope, of sinne the markt out man. Doth harbor Wolues, but harmelesse lambes deuoure, Proud Romes bloud thirstie big swolne throat bepaints. Popes scarlet robes, with bloud of heauens deare saints. Proudly the Pope doth so himselfe preferre, As that he must on earth earths God be held, In cause of faith (who dares say) Popes do erre. Gods owne deere to their decrees must yeeld, Yet from the Pope like blasting lightnings flie, Foule errors, lies, and faithlesse heresie. From Peter doth such Godlesse race proceed, No sure such Iudas like succession, From hell both flow, hels diuell daily feed. Such poysned viprous vild transgression, What vildnesse then dares boldly to expresse, That Rome's the sea, of sacred holinesse. Those notes, those signes, those markes, and all those names, With Antichrist must on his forehead beare, Shine in the Pope with patent burning flames. He wants no badge the monstrous beast should beare, That Wolfish Fox chast from his falshoods burrow, His selfe dispaire, himselfe to death shall worrow. Arme, Arme for God doth wrathfull warre proclaime, The beaste must dowme his high growne sinne is ripe, From euill to worse, he swiftly flies amaine, And bendes his force saluation out to wipe, He would raise vp a mightie Monarch such, As should his sea with strength and wealth inrich. He and his Campions now they mustering are, By oathes, by force, by Treason fraud and bloud, He layes his plots how best to mannage warre, The diuill for him hath vp in councell stood, The Pope resolu'd all thinges doth readie make, His thundring curse shall seeme the world to shake. His purpose doth but his owne fall resemble, For such a curse will shortly fall on him, As all the world thereat amaz'd shall tremble, Blood thirstie throates in pooles of blood swim, Fire finall, and fire infinite, Are both prepar'd, in wrath proud Rome to smite. Romes Gog, and Turkish Magog both they rose, At once the Pope and helhowne Mawhumet. On earth grew great, but greater are their woes. The Pope as god thrond in his church doth set, That Antichrist to ruine first must fall, And then the worlds great Magog perish shall, How runs ths time all whist and quiet thought, Gods word, Heauens signes, worlds sinne, hels rage times rot, Strange reuolutions to threatning Periods brought. Of some great worke all these thinges speake they not, A Plage and plagues do with continuance runne, For somthing is but not what should be done. Then turne to God and aske the question why, Finde out of sinne which doth him most displease, False bloudie house in blouds reuenge must dye, Gods will performd then is his wrath apeasd, The house of bloud which wold gods church confound, So race as it may feel distructions wound. The scarlet horse, on which the beast doth ride, Was by the beast, wounded and heald againe, But yet the beast his scarre could neuer hide. Nor shunne the wound himselfe did deadly maine, Both horse, and beast, beasts both, are both so wounded. As both must be by force thereof confounded. That arme whose blow did make Romes beast to reele, Grew first from thence, from whence a power doth grow, Whose strength hath felt, but ten times more shall feele. Euen to his last most fatall ouerthrow, And now Romes pride, which doth of wonders vant, With wonder thus, may we with wonders dant. How wonderously did God from death defend, A Princes when to certaine death expos'd, Through Iron gates, heauen safties arme did send. And heauens belou'd, from danger safe inclos'd, Heauens saint was saued, that she heauens saints might saue, Heauen vnto her, a crowne and Scepter gaue. How was her life and glorie of her state, By wonder kept from Popish treasons rage, How bloudy was Romes proud intestiue hate. When but her bloud could traytors spite aswage, When wonders were the plots of Romes pretence, Miraculus was then her liues defence. Three and thirtie yeares by treason Rome conspir'd, Her subiects were by oath false traytors sworne, Time, place and meanes, when fit as hell desier'd. Diuels in that instant from their hopes were torne, And heauens Eliza was by wonder seene, From treason kept to liue worlds peerelesse Queene. When Rome in rage a hostill power did raise, By force of sword her kingdomes to inuade, Then to the glorie of her endlesse praise. Eliza was a glorious conqueror made, In spite of all Romes bloudie plots obserued, By miracle she was a Queene preserued. Her great successor by most lawfull right, With how great wonder liued he Scotlands King, When priuat treason and rebellions might. Against his life a Popish strength did bring, By miracle God kept his Maiestie, And gaue to him great Brittans Monarchie. Aud being once in regald Throne instald, What strange deuice had Roman traytors got, The diuell from hell their hellish practise cald. To be an agent in that damned plot, By miracle it rightly may be sayd, Was brought to light such treason closely layd. These miracles their truth doth farre surpasse, Those idle tales that papists cast at vs, Their lies, their child, their straw, their lying grasse. Are all extinct, by truth miraculus, Aud thence shall rise where truth confirmes heauens wonder, Astrength to breake all falshoods frame in sunder. Though God be powerfull in his safeties arme, Yet hath and must externall meanes be vs'd, We must not thinke we can be kept from harme. If carefull counsell be carelesly refus'd, The grace which God doth graciously bestow, Should teach vs how his pleasures will to know. Then to preuent the craft of Romes proud Pope, And safe to make succeeding happie times, Strike roundly vp the heeles of Popish hope. Race downe those wals by which foule treason climes, The Popish Priest is like the Iesuit naught, Rome hath to both vild treasons lesson taught. Those Priests would worke like labourers in a mine, Vnseene, and Iesuits they should beare the name, To be state traytors, the wounds of bleeding time. But Priests (poore soules) worke no such deedes of shame, And yet the Seminarie, or Priest secular, Are as the Iesuits traytors regular. One selfe same rule doth both their workes direct, And to like purpose their restlesse labors striue, For Romes auaile they treasons must protect. And gainst their king each trayterous plot contriue, For when they breake diuine and humane lawes, Then their religion doth defend their cause. Their oylie tongues haue power to perswade, And from the king his subiects hearts to steale, By them indeed are secret traytors made. Whose outward shew can their close thoughts conseale, Their's strength to much in one vild Priest or two, Amongst vs here (as Iesuits) harme to do. The Priest doth scorne an vpstart Iesuit should, By begging creepe into more princely grace, Then they or any shauen pate order could. That are descended from more ancient race, This is the prize their warre doth most assaile, Which of them best can worke for Romes auaile. But in that strife aloft the Iesuit flies, Contenting best princely ambitious eares. They know the grounds of secret pollicie. And kings to Monarches their perswasion reares, They vow they will, this high pitcht note they sing, To Romes allegiance kings and kingdomes bring. The Priest doth scorne the Iesuits brauing course, And flouting thus do (in derision) say, Their counsell doth to late repentance force. But Priests do bring more soules to hell then they, The Pope to serue is their contention, Dangers alike craue like preuention. The law is iust that to deaths iudgement thowes, Those that would turne subiects against their king, By popish priests the fruit of treason growes. They vnto vs do greatest danger bring, Those that by them to Rome are reconcild, Proue like themselues in heart, their thoughts as vild. Let iustice then law iustly execute, And by the root plucke vp Romes trayterous plants, Let subiects know obedience is the fruit. That their submission to their Soueraigne grants, Those not allowing their kings supremacie, Giue them no strength, no wealth, no libertie. Who dares not sweare allegiance to his king, But vowes himselfe vnto the Popes behest, Will at the Popes command do any thing. And such a one hides treason in his brest, Let not their countrey vnto them do good, Who Popes to please will sucke their countries bloud. Abhominations desolation, May crosse our hopes although so well begone, By granting forth a Popish dispensation. By meanes whereof may mischiefe still be done. But such whose oath no strength of truth can giue, Soone may they dye, or else exiled liue. Blacke treason then will flie from Brittains coast, When traytors haue no shrouding place allowed, Romes Priest or Iesuit hauing lost their hoast: Will come no more to worke their mischiefes vowd, From Tiber if to swim to vs they striue, At Tyborne then shall all such saints ariue. Then should our peace bring forth of peace the fruits, When Christ his spouse should in her glorie shine, Not being maskt in Antichristian sutes. But like her selfe cloathed in her robes diuine, This is the worke which should to passe be brought, And this to crosse are strange preuentions wrought. Those amongst vs that Romes religion loue, And yet do hate the euils that Pope allow, Let all their actions to their king approue, That vnto him they faith obedience vow, If to their king and countrey faithfull then, Though Papists yet report them honest men. Those of that sort will not our good preuent, Their countries spoyle they'le not indure to worke, Those traytors that from Rome are hither sent. Shall not consealed in their houses lurke, They chiefly will such vpright course affect, As best may cleere them from foule euils suspect. And such as those be they with fauour vs'd, If ioynd with vs in Secraments and prayer, Without iust cause be not their loues refus'd. Nor let vs of their faith or loue despaire, They may at lest see in truths christall myror, How to wipe out the staines of popish error. But such as are peruersly obstinate, Or bow, or breake by lawes commanding power, Those that to Rome themselues do subiugate. They onely are Romes constant friends not ours, Such in their hearts are to vild mischiefes bent, Wisedome and iudgement must their hopes preuent. Some insolent and most presumptuous proud, Will dare to speake and boast of future hope, There shall (say they) a strength remoue the cloud. That hides worlds glorie from worlds holiest Pope, Still their deuice remoues from plot to plot, That one may hold though many prosper not. A circuit large their compast hope doth reach, Wishing to raise a king aboue their owne, The Pope and Iesuits grounded precepts teach. How best may grow to seed that Rome hath sowne, Romes plots, deuices, and inuentions all, Striue most to make great Brittans Monarch fall. Lay hold on time, whilst time is friend to thee, Ioyne where is ioy'nd a strength truth to defend, Let ou'r thy friends, thy foes no conquerors be. Breake not thy bow ere thou begin to bend, When open danger in secret working stayes, Make strong, begin, much dangerous are delayes. The curious sturre that selfe conceited wits, Do wrangling make for cerimoniall rightes, Iustice must cure all those Ague fits, Against our pcace their vaine contention fights, The Puritan though rising like a bable, Yet doth his error cause dissentions trouble. Our royall King, at first the Church suruayd, To truths Religion hauing chiefe respect, On holy writ he faiths foundation layd. Vnfaithfull those that to obey neglect, Oh let not such as should obedience preach, By vaine contending vaine contentions teach. Vnitie, we then in vnions concord peace, Where God and nature haue one nation made, By wisedomes law let all dissention cease. Discords blacke cloud spreads a prodigious shade, Vnited loue doth discords strength repell, And sauft best doth in loues vnion dwell. The head and members nature doth compact, That all as one do worke for others good, No ones best ioy doth others harme inact. Nor is the heads great ruling power withstood, Nature expels what gainst her health contendeth, What she defends her certaine good defendeth. Oh may the good of Brittans publicke weale, Be in a blessed peacefull vnion wrought, That done time would her happiest worke reueale, Which should be to a blest conclusion brought, Brittane is safe of world and hell though spited, When in one heart her nations are vnited. Great Brittan then with ioyes contentment smile, In thee a puissant potent power doth liue, From Rome Romes Pope and Papall sea exile. Vnto earths whore her vowed distruction giue, Performe that worke to which by God thou'rt cald, And then thy state is on a rocke instald. With faithfull hearts and constant loyall hands, Let's ioyne in truth our God and king to serue, Freeing our selues from Sathans Popish bands. Which do from faith and truths obedience swarue, So shall we ioy with conquering triumph still, As Gods true saints on Syons glorious hill. FINIS.</field>
