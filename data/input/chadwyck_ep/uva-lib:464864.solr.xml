      <field name="fulltext">The KITE. Argument of the Whole POEM. Dian's Character. Cupid, Jealous of her growing Power, retires to her Apartment, and seizes the Copy-Book, by which she first learn'd to Write. A Description of it. He finds the Young Lady Her-self at her Harpsichord. The Particulars of her Song. Cupid opens his Design of Making the Kite, and offers his Arms to Dian. The Loves Descend. The Plan for the Kite is laid out by a Mechanical Love, who begs Cupid's Bow of Dian. They all assist in the Work, 'till the Leaves of the Copy-Book are us'd. Here Mercury seasonably furnishes them with Acts of Parliament. The Tail is finish'd, and the Lanthorn added by Dian. Cupid receives it, and institutes the Game of Leaping over the Candle. A short Episode on this Subject. One of the Loves is sent to Ãolus, for a prosperous Gale to fly the Kite. Ãolus his Cell describ'd. The Love returns with the Gale to Dian. Cupid gives Directions for the Flight. Juno's Envy, who sends Iris to Cut the String. The Kite is turn'd into a Star. CANTO I. Dian knew well to chace the tim'rous Hare, Or thro' the Woods pursue the flying Deer; O'er the high Mound Her Courser rag'd secure, Eager, yet Conscious of the Charge he bore: While Health auspicious mantled in Her Face, Glow'd on Her Cheek, and heighten'd ev'ry Grace. Or if the Clam'rous Echo's of the Field, To the Gay Dance, and sweeter Musick yield, Her courtly Motion set the Soul on Fire, And told us all the Graces of the Lyre. If DIAN at the Frame display'd Her Power, And charg'd the Needle with the future Flower, New Life like some kind Destiny She gives, And in a nobler Loom the Alluding to particular Names given by Florists &amp;c. LOVE Heroe lives: Here Ormond's Duke Retir'd from Martial Cares, The Peaceful Scarlet of a Tulip wears; There Great Eugene in Azure Robes array'd, Confess'd his Toils and Dangers well repaid; Here grew, adorn'd with ev'ry spreading Grace, The Purple Honours of the Gay BORLACE: On this fair Stalk the Gallick Monarch shone, More Powerful on Her Apron, than His Throne. LOVE with a Jealous Eye beheld the Fair, Number'd Her Conquests, and began to fear, Watch'd ev'ry Glance that wander'd from her Eye, And saw with less Success His Arrows fly: âBut must that Empire I Derive from Heaven âBe given to DIAN all! So cheaply given! âNations no more at my dread Altars Bow! âAnd these Victorious Shafts lie Useless now! âNot so the Golden Trophy Venus gain'd, â'Twas with the Ruins of a Troy She reign'd, âWhen Slighted Iuno, raging with Despair, âLed sternly out Her Booted Greeks to War. So griev'd the God, and stung with Fury fled, Where Jealous Rage, and Pale Resentment led. Sacred to Secrecy, and sweet Repose, Rose an Alcove, where rang'd in artful Rows: (By DIAN wrought) the Drowzy Poppy grows; The Virgin here, like Sol's declining Ray, Withdrew her Lustre, and retir'd from Day: Gay Fancy, ever waking, here retains Her liveliest Visions, and Her softest Scenes, While Slumbers round their silent Station take, And seal those Eyes that keep the World awake: Where Wedding-Cake, inspiring pleasing Dreams, The happy Partner of Her Bed proclaims, While Guardian Loves the merry Dance begin, And Jolly Hymen leads the Bridegroom in. In Caskets here unnumber'd Trophies lay, And loaded Shelves their Mimick Pomp display; Here Paper-Towns their waving Turrets shew, And Forests from her Scissars taught to grow; There the Proud Ship extends its wondrous Frame, And to the Maid brings Home eternal Fame; Carnations here the lingring Eye regale, Here ever blows the Lily of the Vale; The lavish Rose here wantons all the Year, So spreads its blooming Leaves, so blushes here. Here, to repair his Loss, Poor Cupid flies, And Darts in ev'ry Cask His Restless Eyes. Beneath a gilded Pile of Billetdeuxs, Cupid at length the Marbled Quarto views, That taught Her Words a Sable Hue to wear, And bid 'em Please the Eye, as well as Ear. In Virgin Order the Coy Letters move, Nor Modest know the closer Ties of Love; Yet not the Chief, that boasts a flourish'd Train, (The Rolling Beauties of a Hasty Pen) With all His gaudy Ornaments cou'd Please More than the simple Elegance of These: Here A, by Himself A, Sirnam'd the Great, With awful Front o'erlooks the little State, And like Ãneas, with Majestick Pace, T'Italian Order leads his letter'd Race; While, next Him, little a with Youthful Pride, Trips like IÃ¼lus by his Father's Side; Here bending c's disclose half Orbs of Light, Like the new Honours of the Queen of Night; There i, like the Fifth Edward, stands display'd, His Crown for ever hanging o'er his Head: There o, distinguish'd by his curious Round, And q by Children in the Corner found. The s, with arched Neck, and Tail reclin'd, And the Twin u's in sacred Friendship join'd. Each Letter thus, by diff'rent Beauties known, In Order led the gay Succession on. Trembling with eager Joy, He snatch'd the Prize, DIAN no more grew Hateful to His Eyes; And now in Haste His golden Wings He spread, And, all Impatient, sought the Beauteous Maid. Fix'd to the Lyre, He found the tuneful Fair, The Mystick Numbers well deserv'd his Ear; She Sung, when Ghosts approach, why Lights burn Blue, Why Candles shew the future Billetdeux; Why from the Taper rose the Virgin-Strife, Why Chastest Breath recalls it into Life; Why the Young Hylas bids his Father run T' obey the Summons of a Watry Sun; And why, to Think, shou'd aid the Huswife's Skill, And thro' the Joynt conduct the lucky Steel; What certain Ills succeed, if Crickets call, Why States, and Saltsellars together fall. CANTO II. The Virgin ceas'd; and Venus' smiling Son. (The Volume waving in his Hand) begun. âIf e'er I taught that Breast to fall, and rise, âAnd empty'd Quivers from those sparkling Eyes; âIf I, the Lover sweetly to beguile, âSpread o'er those dimpled Cheeks that winning Smile, âLet Cupid once his earnest Wish obtain, âHear what He asks, nor let Him ask in vain. âKnow then, Fair Maid, from Love's great Sov'reign know, âHas Cupid ought?â'Tis All Fair DIAN's now! âThe World thy gentle Edicts shall obey, âAnd Love's Liege Subjects hear their Laws from Thee. âThee shall the Graces, Thee the Smiles attend, âAnd Young Desires around, their Airy Camp extend. âBut shall these Hands no Mark of Favour boast, âRobb'd of their Arms!âMy Bow, my Quiver lost! âAh let the Skilful Maid a FRAME prepare, âThese Leaves (so Heav'n has doom'd) must rise in Air: âThen, born on Zephyrs, shall thy Work be seen, âAnd Distant Eyes adore the Wing'd Machine: âCupid well-pleas'd shall guide its easy Flight, âAnd DIAN too shall view its wondrous Height! âAt Jove's Command, the Royal Eagle flies, âAnd bears his rolling Thunder thro' the Skies, âThe gaudy Peacock struts in Plumy Pride, âAnd stalks Majestick by a Juno's Side; âAnd, tho' Mamma prefers her wanton Dove, âCupid shall have a better BIRD than Jove. Thus urg'd the Power of LoveâAgreedâshe cri'd, And reach'd the Bow and Quiver from his Side. Now to their Posts a Thousand Loves descend, And round the Fair with busy Zeal attend; Amongst 'em ONE, whom long Experience blest With a Mechanick Head above the Rest. HE form'd the Ruff in good Eliza's Days, And first confin'd the slender Wast in Stays: HE first with Beauty-Spots adorn'd the Maid, And bid Her borrow Lustre from their Shade. HE knitt the Lover's-Knot, in Times of Old, And form'd the Circle of the Bridal Gold. HE on the Ear first hung the Sparkling Rings, His was the Tucker, his the Kissing-Strings; HE first in Canvas-Hoop enclos'd the Maid, Turn'd the Round-Coif, and rais'd the Stiffen'd-Head. While other Loves the Paste, or Pack thread brought, Drew out the Plan, and Built the BIRD in Thought: HE sought the Wand, which first Her Grandsire bore, Th' expressive Ensign of the Sheriff's Power; Who, Dying, left the Trophy to His Son, (For so Devolv'd the Honours, and the Wand,) This next the Infant DIAN active strode, And round the Parlor, fancy'd Journies rode: (It's Mane, like Gold, in glitt'ring Tinsel spread, And Painted Streamers nodded o'er Its Head.) But now Miss MOLLY, with becoming Speed, Press'd with Her wanton Weight the nimble Reed: Artful He tempts the little Fair to stay, And steals the long-descended Gift away. The Winged Band with Joy surround the Wand, Fair DIAN Smil'd, and thus the Love began. âAh! Gen'rous Victor, spare one useless Toy! âAh! Let us once again the Bow enjoy! âThose Eyes alone can greater Mischiefs do, âWant not Our Skill, and Wound without our Bow! âBe Thine the Turtles! Be the Sparrows Thine! âAnd keep the Quiver!âBut the Bow resign! âCrown'd with its Arch, MARIA's Horse shall rise, âAnd trail thy Labours thro' the wond'ring Skies! Thus He: Nor Su'd in vain; the Maid gave Ear, And with a graceful Nod receiv'd his Pray'r. And now, Disrob'd of all its Useless Pride, Firm to the Bow the Pliant Reed She ty'd; As when (some full, but distant Mark in view) With stretch'd-out Arm the Parthian draws his Yew; The String, declining from its closing Ends, Obliquely to the Arrow's Head descends; So fell the Cord, so stood the Captive Steed, By DIAN's Hand to rise, for nobler Flights decreed. The Little Loves, not Idle by her Side, For various Works the Manuscript divide: Those o'er the Surface spread its Leaves, while These Collect the Sacred Relicks for the STAYS. Exulting Cupid too his Tribute brings, And waves on high the deeply-scollop'd Wings: With Art divine the Fringe He gather'd round, And with a Silken Cord the Tassels bound: His Bow with These the Power of Love adorns, And the gay Pendants tremble from its Horns. Yet ah! what boots his Care? what Grief attends, And all his Joy at once and Labour ends! The Volume fails!âand still unfinish'd lies The Bird of LOVE! still wants a Tail to rise! But while around th' imperfect Work they wait, Or by the Silent Maid all pensive sate, HERMES (so bids the Laughter-loving Dame) Like an Old Justice of the Quorum came. A Dark full-bottom'd Wig his Temples shades, And o'er his Shoulders venerably spreads. An ancient Cane His steady Steps did guide, And an Old Sword stuck stiffly by his Side: With a long File of Senate-Acts He came, These Tax'd the Landâand Those Secur'd the Game: In DIAN's Skilful Hand He left the Prize, And quick as Thought shot upward to the Skies. With cautious Skill the shining Steel She guides, And in small Remnants Hermes' Gift divides. Speeches of Kings came flourish'd from Her Hand, And furl'd like Heroe's Plumes their Edicts stand. Laws hung like Cambrick on the Wrists of Beauxs And ANNA's Acts look'd like Her Furbeloes. These nicely-gather'd on Her Lace she strung, And on the BIRD Decrees of Nations hung. Of Proclamations next a Dome she frames, Enclos'd within, a living Taper flames: Thro' equal Folds its wanton Blazes play, And wavy Rounds transmit the Silver Ray. CUPID with Reverence receives the Prize, (A thousand Transports sparkling in His Eyes:) âAnd shall great Actions publick Triumphs grace, âAnd does thy Work (He cry'd) deserve 'em less? âWhen Python by Apollo's Arm lay slain, âAnd stretch'd his livid Body o'er the Plain, âRevolving Seasons did the Deed proclaim, âAnd spoke the Conquest in the Pythian Game: âIn ev'ry Age this just Reward was Due, âAnd Roman Games, as Roman Heroes grew; âBut still to LOVE proceed no solemn Shows, âNo Myrtle Garland binds the Victor's Brows. âHence then shall the Gay Youth and Active Maid, âIn merry Gambols sly o'er This, with the following Episode, referrs to the Riddle,âLittle White Nancy, &amp;c. NANCY's Head. (âFor know that trembling Light which glimmers there âWas NANCY once, a Maid, like DIAN Fair) âWhen merry Sports the hoary Season brings, âAnd raises Hinds from Slaves to short-liv'd Kings, âWhen ROSE the circling Monarchy obtains, âAnd dreadful Whiskers mark disloyal Swains, âThis sure at least may NANCY's Mem'ry claim, âAnd DIAN's Work demand a Winter-Evening's Game. Thus spoke the GOD, then spread his golden Wings, And o'er the waving Taper active springs; Fair Venus's Sons the great Example view, And o'er the Light their vaulting Chief pursue. But say, my Muse, (since Thou alone canst tell,) How Nancy Liv'd, and how lamented Fell! Nancy, a Virgin of the Vestal Train, Hymen in Marriage sought; but sought in vain. In vain He strove with all His Joys to move, And warm Her Marble Breast to Nuptial Love: The Nymph, Regardless of His Pray'rs and Sighs, From His Embraces pale and panting flies; The God pursued;âand now had reach'd the Fair, As thus she criedââO Holy Vesta hear! âLet Nancy still amid thy Maiden Choir âFrom Hymen free preserve thy living Fire! She said:âand sudden to a Taper turn'd, And in his circling Arms, still trembling, burn'd. âYet shalt Thou, Stubborn Maid, enrag'd He cry'd, âAt all my Wedding-Feasts, attend the Bride; âWhereever Hymen's call'd, Thou too be there, âA Witness to those Joys Thou wouldst not share, Thus Heâand on his Nancy silent gaz'd, As Her White-Petticoat, around her blaz'd. So great ALCIDES from the World retir'd, And flaming, in the Magick-Shirt, expir'd. CANTO III. But CUPID now with anxious Thoughts oppress'd Ceas'd from His SPORT, and thus the Loves address'd. âThus far has Jove and Fate propitious shone, âOur BIRD is finish'd, and One Labour done! âIts Safety is our next, our chiefest Care, âWhile High It soars thro' pathless Fields of Air. âTo guard It from the Whirlwind's rapid Power, âOr careful shield It from the treach'rous Shower: âWill Ãolus Implor'd refuse His Aid? âOr Jove deny when LOVE and DIAN plead? Scarce had He ended, but a Love withdrew, And on the Wings of gen'rous Duty flew; Nor tarry'd 'till He reach'd the distant Cells, Where the Hoarse Wind's Imperious Tyrant dwells. Here breath'd the South, that falls in genial Showers, And gentle Zephyr crown'd with Vernal Flowers: There blew the East, that buttons Breasts of Beauxs, And over Chloe's Neck the Tippet throws; Or with the North in dreadful Union raves, Whirls o'er the Main, and rolls the madding Waves. So (if great Things may be compar'd with small, And troubled Oceans to a Jug of Ale) When TATTLE heats the Drink that chears Her Soul, And to Her Tooth prepares the groaning Bowl: Her giddy Hands the mingling Fluids shake, And the white Bubbles o'er the Surface break. Unnumber'd Virgins croud on ev'ry Side, To various Punishments condemn'd for Pride. Belinda here with Pins and Powder sits, And at the Glass with fruitless Labour waits: Behind Her Chair the Ruffling North attends, And ever discomposes as She mends: Raw Vapours steam a-round the cruel Fair, And Winds that whistle nothing but Despair. There Amoret cold piercing Blasts pursue, And stain her Nose with everlasting Blue! Others, whose Hoops unwary Youths enflam'd, Here runâO L?d! so rumpled and asham'd! Thro' These the Love, and not regardless, pass'd, As onward to the Monarch's Throne He press'd: The Merchant here His ready Aid implores, And asks a brisker Gale from India's Shores. There Luckless Hero for a Calm intreats, While Her Leander tempts the fatal Streights: And Black-Ey'd Susan with Impatience burns, To know how soon sweet William's Ship returns. Whilst ÃOL 'midst his Guards, in awful State, Array'd in Furr, like Russia's Sov'reign Sate: With stretch'd-out Arm dispensing Prosp'rous Gales, To swell to Fame and Conquest, British Sails. Now all was hush'd, and LOVE his Silence broke, And thus the Wind-compelling King bespoke. âIf ever DIAN's Beauty reach'd thy Cell, âIf e'er thine Eye beheld the Sportive Belle, âWhen the Fair Huntress, foremost of the Train, âGrew to Her Steed, and scowr'd along the Plain: âIf Ãol then in conscious Rapture stray'd, âAnd round Her Neck, in glad Confusion, play'd; âIf then, with greedy Joy, Her Lips He press'd, âRumpled Her Tucker, and unveil'd Her Breast; âThat Hand, that did so soft thy Bliss reprove, âGives to thy Charge, this Day, the BIRD of Love: âLet Zephyrs then, in active Whispers breath, âBut ev'ry other Wind be still, as Death! âThis FAN be Thine, and such in Love it's Pow'r, âNot Jove in all His Shapes e'er boasted more: âWhen future Passions shall thy Breast invade, âBe this the Present to the Fav'rite Maid; âIt's Sheet unfurl'd, reveals a Scene of Gold, âAnd Love in Ambush lies in ev'ry Fold; âSoon as Her Hand these painted Altars raise, âThe Nymph, not vainly, with my Arrows plays; âThis ever shall new Thoughts of Thee suggest, âAnd bear Thee to Her Lips, and waft Thee to Her Breast. Thus Heâand the grim Monarch of the Wind In swelling Bags, a happy Gale confin'd; With These well-fraught, the Love returns to Day, And back to DIAN wings his liquid Way. Now with the Bird She seeks the flow'ry Meads, (Pancies, and Dazies, grow where e'er She treads;) The little Loves around, with decent Pride, Hang on Her Hoop, and Triumph by Her Side. Lo! Mid the Ranks, superiour, CUPID moves, And Issues out His Orders to the Loves; To These He gave the Lanthorn, and the Tail, But trebly charg'd 'em to supply the Gale: A chosen Cohort from the Rest he drew, And to Their Care assign'd th' important Clue. âSoon as the Maid in equal Poise sustains, âAnd on Her Arm my Bird obliquely leans, âYou forward Hasteâ(this Glove shall be the Sign) âWith Judgment to contract, or give It Line; âDo You with Caution from the Tail repair, âBut Yield the Lanthorn with distinguish'd Care! âWho diligent, this Day, attends my Bird, âHis Hand shall, next to CUPID's, Hold the Cord. The Glove was wav'dâThe steady Engine flew, Sprung into Air, and lessen'd to the View; Proudly It Sail'd, on crowding Zephyrs born, And ev'ry Love was Pilot in his Turn: DIAN transported too, beheld It fly, And to the Taper grew Her aking Eye. But CUPID tim'rous saw It's Height in Air, And thought His Bird too Distant from His Care; 'Twas He The MESSENGER decreed to send, And wou'd (by Proxy) on His Bird attend: What better than a Billetdeux may prove, The Tender Representative of LOVE? Fo lo! The Maid a gilded Sheet imparts, That breath'd unfeigned Flames, and real Darts. Led by the Clue, Its rapid Flight It steers, And to the Bird, his Airy Summons bears. Ah! What avail It's easy-waving Wings? And Length of Tail, that boasts Successive Acts of Kings! How frail our Span of Time! How fix'd its Date, And greatest Works must one Day yield to Fate! Sleep-breaking Care, Gay Pleasure, and Pale Woe, Meet in one Stream! and in one Channel flow! Virtue but like a shining Vapour flies! And when it brightest Blazes, soonest Dies! For Juno now (ah! too relentless Queen!) Saw CUPID's Bird, saw CUPID's Joy with Pain! Her past Dishonour all Her Breast alarms, Venus prefer'd, and Her own slighted Charms! Now from Her Eye a Gleam of Envy breaks, And all the Goddess to Revenge awakes. âShall Juno then Inglorious quit the Field? âAnd Unreveng'd the Palm of Beauty yield? âIf Ida's Goddess boasts superiour Charms, âWhy did my Jove prefer me to His Arms? âBut, still Her Impious Hands detain the Prize, âHer Pow'r encreases! And Her Altars rise! âWhile I to partial Fate unheard complain, âAnd call for Vengeance to the Gods in vain! âBut swift thro' Ãther let my IRIS glide, âAnd hang my keenest Scissars by Her Side: âFor lo! where yonder glimm'ring Ray appears, âHer Urchin's Bird it's airy Journey steers! âThere all His Joy on One small Thread depends, âThat Cut,âat once His Hope and Empire ends! She said: and Iris to her Charge repairs, And reach'd the String, and clos'd the fatal Sheers! Thrice was the baleful Raven heard to croak, And Hollow Groans from Heavy Echo's broke! Schreech-Owls around the dire Event foreshew, And Cynthia from the Mournful Scene withdrew! NIGHT, silent, bore It Blazing thro' the Air, And deck'd Her Mantle with the Rising STAR. FINIS.</field>
