Man yhernes rimes for to here, And romans red on maneres sere, Of Alisaundur þe conquerour; Of Iuly Cesar þe emparour; O grece and troy the strang strijf, þere many thosand lesis þer lijf; O brut þat bern bald of hand, þe first conquerour of Ingland; O kyng arthour þat was so rike, Quam non in hys tim was like, O ferlys þat hys knythes fell, þat aunters sere I here of tell, Als wawan, cai and oþer stabell, For to were þe ronde tabell; How charles kyng and rauland faght, Wit sarazins wald þai na saght; [Of] tristrem and hys leif ysote, How he for here be-com a sote, O Ioneck and of ysambrase, O ydoine and of amadase Storis als o ferekin thinges O princes, prelates and o kynges; Sanges sere of selcuth rime, Inglis, frankys, and latine, to rede and here Ilkon is prest, þe thynges þat þam likes best. þe wisman wil o wisdom here, þe foul hym draghus to foly nere, þe wrang to here o right is lath, And pride wyt buxsumnes is wrath; O chastite has lichur leth On charite ai werrais wreth; Bot be the fruit may scilwis se, O quat vertu is ilka tre Of alkyn fruit þat man schal fynd He fettes fro þe rote his kynd. O gode pertre coms god peres, Wers tre, vers fruit it beres; þat I speke o þis ilke tre, Bytakens, man, both me and þe: þis fruit bitakens alle oure dedis, Both gode and ille qua rightly redis; Vr dedis fro vr hert tas rote, [Que]dur þai be worthi or bale or bote; For be þe thyng man drawes till Men schal him k[n]aw for god or ill. A saumpul her be þaem I say, þat rages in þare riot ay; In riot and in rigolage, Of all þere liif spend þai þe stage; For now is halden non in curs, Bot qua þat luue can paramurs; þat foly luue þat uanite, þam likes now nan oþer gle; Hit neys bot fantum for to say, To day it is, to moru away, Wyt chaunce of ded, or chaunce of hert, þat soft began has endyng smart; For wen þow traistes[t] wenis at be, Fro hir schalt þou, or scho fro þe. He þat [s]titthest wenis at stand, Warre hym his fall is nexst his hand, Ar he sua brathly don be broght, Wydur to wende ne wat he noght; Bytuix and his luf haf hym ledd, To sli mede als he hym forwit [bedd;] For þan sal mede witouten mere, be mette for dede or bettur or were. For-þi blisce and þat paramour, Quen i haue nede me dos socure, þat saues me first in herth fra syn, And heuen blys me helps to wyn.

Qua truly loues þis lemman, þis es þe loue bes neuer gan; For in þis loue scho failes neuer, And in þat toþer scho lastes ever. Off suilk an suld ?e [mater] take, Crafty þat can rimes make; Of hir to mak bath rim and sang, And luue hir suette sun amang. Quat bote is to sette traueil On thyng þat may not auail, þat es bot fantum o þis warld, Als ?e haue sene inogh and herd. Mater fynd ?e large and brade? Þof rimes fele of hir be made, Qua-sa will of hy[r] fa[y]rnes spell, Find he sal inogh to tell; Of hir godnes and hir treuthede, Men may fynd euermar to rede; O reut[h] o loue and charite, Was neuer hir mak, ne neuer sal be. Lauedi scho es o leuedis all, Mild and mek witouten gall, to nedi neghest on to call, And raises synful quen þai fall; Til all oure bale ai for to bete, Oure lauerd has made þat maiden suette; þar-bi man mai hir helping kenn, Scho prais ai for sinful menn; Qua menskes hir, þai may be bald, Scho sal þam ?eld a hundreth fald.

Abraham had his hert ful sare, Fra þeþen he tok talent to fare; Til a contre cades he flitt, Abimalech was lauerd of hitt; His sister he cald sarra his wijf, For þare for hir suld rise na strijf.

Abimalech ne fined noght to þat sarra was to him broht. Bot godd on night com to þe king, In slepe, and said him sli talking— “þou king,” he said, “loses þi lijf, þou has anoþer man[ne]s wijf.” “Lauerd,” he said, “wil þou me sla, I wist not for soth þat it was sua; þai tald bath here, til an and oþer, Sco was his sister and he hir broþer; And alsua, lauerd, wel þou wat þat I. haf halden clene hir stat.” “I wat,” he said, “þat þou art clene, War it not sua if i ne had bene, Fra toche of hir i saued þe, þat þou suld not sin in me; Yeild hir to hir husband schet, For hir husband es a prophet; And if þou dos anoþer red þou and þine all sal be dede.” Vp ras þe king, on nighter tale, And cald his men be for him hale; O þis warning he þam tald, And þai þam dred both yong and ald. He did to cal habraham son, And said, “qui has þou þusgat don?

De ortu &amp; int[er]p[re]tacione ysaac Bi þis come sarra to þe tide, O birth sco moght not ouerbide; þan ysaac þair sun was born, þat lang was hight to þam biforn; Was circumcised þe aghtand dai, Als was þair heing in þair lay.

Ysaac was yonger þan ysmael. Bitide apon a dai it fell þat þir breþer þam plaijd samen, Sarra beheled and thoght na gamen. Sco sceud abraham, “yon bastard Do him a-wai, þat he ne has partd Wit mi sun of our heritage, For elles, me thinc, þou dos outrage. I wil, quat-sum man thinc or sai, His moder and he be don a-way.” Abraham hit tok til hert, And thought þis wordes war to smert; For his sun him ful heui thoght til þe angel had him word broght. “Abraham,” he said, “giue þe not ill, þou most now do þi wijf[es] will O þi maiden and o þi barn, Hir bidding do sal þou not warn; For ysaac sal bere þe nam O þi sede, sir abraham; þof ysmael be noght o spus O him sal gret men cum and crus.” Sun on þe morn, quen it was dai, Bath war þai don vnto þair wai; Oute of þe hus was pute agar, Hir sun a-pon hir bak sco bar; Water and brede, wit outen mare, Sco trused hir wit, and weped ful sare.

O lagh our lauerd him gaue þe lade, Of him his patriak he made, And said, “abraham, i sal þe giue þe lagh þat þou agh in to liue.” “Lauerd,” he said, “mi self and mine, At þi wil lauerd all es þine, I and mi wijf ar al þin aun, And þar-of ar we wel a-knaun; þi biding wil we do fulfayn, For we sal neuer do þer again, Quat sal i do, lauerd, þou me tell.” “Bot þou sal wend vnto yon fell, þar sal þou find mi messager, þou mak of erth þer an auter; Bath of þi corn and of þi fee þar sal þou offrand mak to mee.” “Gladli, lauerd, als þou has said.” Son was abraham puruaid; O corn, o crop, aght an[d] catell, To godd his tend þar gafe he lele; It brend, þe reke raght vp euen, þe smel was suette þat soght til heuen. In þat siquar þat i of mene þe werd was gode, þe folk was clene.

And he bigan him for to tell. “Yonder vp,” he said, “on yon fell Sal þou bren þi sun for me.” “Gladli, mi lauerd, sua sal it be.” Now sal i tell yow how it was. þe child he kest a-pon a nass, He bad cum wit him knaues tua, Bot þai ne wist quider þai suld ga; He welk þat fell ner dais thre To sek þe sted quar he wald be.

Quen he his folk sagh and aght His broþer he soght alsuith wit saght, For þat he for his come was bl[i]þe, Wel can he wit his kissing kiþe; Sli strengh es o þe holi gast, To saghtnes mak þar wrath es mast. He welcumd iacob selli fair, He wist he was his fader air, Wit-outen wreth, wit-outen wrak, O luue and pes þai samen spak; Quen þai had said þat þai wald sai Esau went him hame his way Vnto seyr þar he com fra, Iacob can til his fader ga; For yeit he was þat sith liuand, Rebecca his moder ded he fand. þis ysaac, þat i of rede, In boke es cald þe lastand seed, He ledd his liue wit-vten blam, And birid biside sir abraham.

Quen þis dughti man was ded, þir breþer tuain þam tok to red To dele þair landes þam bi-tuixs, þat aiþer might þam ald wit his; Til esau bitid ebron And he self went til edom. De iacob &amp; eius filijs &amp; de exsompnia iacob Iacob was selcut riche o fee, Of ilkin god he had plente; He was ful riche, als we rede, Luued and lele, and loued in lede. Bot þof he luued his suns ilkan, Sua wel als ioseph he luued nan, For he was fair, wit-outen sake, O breþer nan had he his make.

Quen þai sagh command ioseph, þair broþer, Ilkan o þaim þan said til oþer— “Lo quar þe dremer now es cummen, Bi drightin now he sal be nummen; Do we him [nu] to dreri ded And his dremmes he siþen red.” Fulfayn war þai þair þar him fand, Now mai þai him haue to will in hand, If þai him forwit oght for-bar, Fra now mai þai noght him spare; An was eildest o þe elleuen þe quilk yee herd me ruben neuen: Quen he herd þai wald himsla, Na selcuth þan him wasful waa; To stint wald he, if he moght, þe foly þat his breþer thoght; All he sagh þam in a wil þair broþer sacles for to spil. “Mi breþer,” he said, “now dos not sua, I rede noght yee your broþer sla, þat es your aun fless and blod, To murþer him it es not god; And, if yee do, for-sotht, mi will, Sal yee neuer haue [harm] þar-till; And if yee do suilk an outrake Ful siker may yee be o wrake, Fra your scending be mad cuth, All men sal yow haue in mouth; þat Baret rede i noght yee bru, þat yow mai euer after ru; He has yow nathing don for-qui Yee haue noght gain him bot enuy, And wijt þat he be slain His liue dais i tell gain.” Ful fellik þai a-gain answard, “Quar-for suld we of oght be ferd?

Putifar ferd in to þe contre, And ioseph dueld wit his meigne, And has his godes all in hand, Als he þat was his al weldand. Ioseph was farli fair in face, And fild wit al of goddes grace.

Als he welk bi þam þar a-stunt, Bi-sid oreb, a litel munt, He sagh a selcuth thing to se, Him thoght brennand he sagh a tre, Als it wit lou war al vm-laid; He thoght, and til him seluen said, “To se yon tre i sal ga nerr, þat semes brennand no[w] on ferr.” Quen he þis busk ner-hand had sene, Wit blome and leif he fand it gren, And þis was a fore-sceuing scene O moder bath and maiden clene, þat siþen lang, wit-vten less, Bar child and sco þerof wemles, Als did þe tre þat semed to bren, And þan was þar na fir wit-in. Als moyses on-ferrum thoght þe tre brinand and brint noght, þan cald on him our lauerd dright, Vt of his mikel lemand light, Tuis moyses cald he be nam: “Quat wil þou, lauerd? here i am.” “I am þin eldres godd,” coth he, “For i þam ledd þai luued me, Mi folk of israel in wa, þat has ben ledd lang sua, And i wil now þair murning mend, To pharaon i will þe send, Pharaon, of egipti king, Vte of his land þam did to bring.” “Lauerd, and quat es i þar-to To suilk a gret nedes do?” “Ga forth,” he said, “wit-vten dred, For i me-self sal þe lede; þat þai noght sai agains mi sand, þou sal þam wit mi takens faand.

Do, moyses, als i þe ken, Ga, gedir samen þin eldir men Of all þi folk of israel, And sai þat i haue herd þam well, þai ar in wandret and in waa, Ful wel i wat þat it es sua; Sai þam i sal þam son visete, þar-to sal be now na lang lite.

Quen it was on þe gress laid, A neddir it was, and he was fraid, Sua ferd þat he to fle bi-gan; To moyses said drightin þan, “I bidd þe strek þi hand þe fra, And bi þe tail þou vp it ta.” Quen moyses it had in hand, Als it was ar, it wex a wand. To moyses þan spak drightin, “þou put þi hand in bosum þin.” He put his hand in, fair in hele, And vte he drogh it als mesel, He put it eft in his spaier, And vte he drogh it, hale and fere. “Ga forth,” he said, “and if þe king Wil noght tru þi first takning, Qua-sa wil noght þe formast tru, To tru þat toþer es þair pru. If þai tru noþer o þeir tua, þe water o þe flum þou ta And put it vp apon þe land, And certainli, þou vnderstand, Al þat þou draus vte o þat flod, It sal be turnd al in-to blod. Wit þe þou sal tak aaron, Yee sal sai to king pharaon þat he lat now mi folk apert Pass, to wirscip me in desert, þar sacrifice at mak to me, Vte of his land dai-ganges thre.” Now makes moyses him boun Als drightin tald him his lessun, His broþer aaron he mett, þat drightin self has meting set, Wit þe eldes folk of israel, Wit pharaon þai went to mel. þai said þat drightin self badd His folk þat vnder him war stadd To giue þam leue wend of his hand, At wirscip him in wildrin land. King pharaon þam gaf ansuar, “Quat es he?” he said, “þat godd, or quar? þat i suld oþer here his saand, O lat þe folk vte o mi land? Noþer i knau him þat yee sai, Ne i ne wil lat þe folk a-wai.” “þus he said, þus-gat wil he, þat his folk cum iornais thre In wildernes offrand to mak, þat suerd apon hus tak na wrak.” “Ferli,” he said, “o yow me thine, Wene yee mi men ta fra þair suinc? þai rise and bredes ai mare and mare, Bot wel mare if þai idel ware.” Dathait qua werkes on þam spar! þan held þai þam harder þan ar, þat fra þat tide ned-wais suld þai Do tua dais werkes on a dai. And taron sett he men at ask Of ilk dai to yeild þair task, And said, “ne lat yee noght þam hon Als þai ha mast-quat hider don, And qua ne dos noght yur bidding, Wit scarp scurges yee þam suing. Now wald þai mak þam a witsau Fra þair warkes for to drau, For to weind to wildernes To þair land, i ne wat quat es; Bot als euer mai brok mi hand I sal þam do duell in mi land.” þan spak þat drightin al weldand Til moyses, his tru seruand, “Quen pharaon sal ask yow Wit quat takning he sal yow tru, þou bidd þi broþer aaron þe wand cast forwit pharaon, And it sal til a nedder worth.” And eft-sith þan þai went þam forth Bi-for þe king, in-til his hall, þar he sat wit his berns all; Bot noght he of þair errand herd. þan tok aaron þis ilk yeird, And on þe flore he kest it don, And it become a worme felon. þan cald þe king his enchaunturs, þe craftes of his iogulurs, Dun þai kest a wand ilkan, And þai wex dragons son onan. Bot aaron wand it wex sa kene, þas oþer it wired al bidene; þe king hert wex herd as bras, “þefolk,” he said, “yeitt sal noght pas.” Drightin þan spac to moysen, “þe hert o pharaon i ken, For now i wat þat it es mar Hardend for mi sau þan ar; And for þat he wil noght me here, Hard on-come sal i send him sere, Bath on him and his kingrike, He sal do mani man mislike.

Gas forth hardili your wai.” To moyses can godd þan sai, “Moyses,” he said, “þou ta þat wand þat þou was wont ber in þi hand, And do þe to þe watur tite, þe see þar-wit þan sal þou smite, And þou sal see it cleue in tua, And giue yow redi wai to ga, þe quilk king pharaon sal se Wit his ost and his meigie; He sal yow wene at ouertake, Bot þan i sal me on him wrake.

Quen þe king þis vnderstod, He folud wit ost on hors and fote, For noght caitiue was him na bote. He sagh þe see it drau in tuin, þe brad wai he did him in. Moises, wit his folk al hale Wit-vten wanting of his tale, Bi-heild þat ost; a-pon þe land He smat þe watur wit his wand. Was þar to se na langer bide, þe see drogh samen on ilka side, Bath bihind þam and bifore, And drun mani hundreth score.

[Off the tre of lyff shalle y telle And of the folk of Israelle] Quen moyses þe folk had ledd Vte ouer þe see, als drightin bedd, He and his broiþer aaron, Vte of thainhed o pharaon, In sirie apon þe toiþer side þai mad þair longing for to bide. To-quils þai duelled þar to rest, O water had þai ful mikel brest, And þof þai soght it her and þare, Water ne fand þai noþer quare. þis folk þat þar aboute him lai Ilkan can til oþeir sai, “Quer we sal in þis wildernes Dei for thrist thoru moyses! Quat sal we drinc, moyses?” cuth þai. Moyses þat night on-slepe lai, þat night yod moyses to rest. On-slepe he lai in þat forest, Quen he þe morn him loked bi He sagh þat him thoght of selly, At his heued þar sagh he stand Wexen o cipres, a wand; On his left hand loked he, An-oþer he sagh o cedre tre; He loked als on his righthand, O pine tre þe thrid he fand; Bi þe leues þat þai bare þai kyd o quatkin kynd þar ware. Bot moyses, for godds au þaa wandes durst he noght vp-drau. þe toþer dai he went þam eke Watur wit þe folk to seke, þar he sleped þat morntide, He fand þe wandes him biside; þe thrid night alsua he fand, þat did him wel at vnderstand þat sum-kin takening suld þar be Loken in þir wandes thre. “Selcuth thing,” he said, “wit-in Suld luken be þaa wandes thrin.” þis wandes takens persons thre, And an-fald godd in vnite. þan he drou þam vp at first, Wit-vten ani brek or brist, And quils þai in þat wastin war, þe wandes ai wit him he bare. Siþen þai faand in þat wastin, Water bitter sum ani brin, Als it war brin þan it was bitter, To drinc þan was ham neuer þe better. Bot quen þis was in don þe water was al suete alson, þe water þat sua fuli stanc, Suetter neuer þai siþen drank. þis meracle sagh þai all aperte þat was duelland in þat desert. Fra þan forth heild sir moyses þis wandes bath in pris and pres; Queder-sum he welk her or þare, þis wandes euer he wit him bare, And wen he clamb mont synai þan he hidd þam priueli; To-quils he fasted his lententid In erth he did þam for to hidd. Ne for na drught, ne for na wat, Changed neuer þai þare state, Bot euer þai held bath lefe and flur Smelland wit a suete odur.

For he þam ledd, and soth it es, Fourti yeir in þat wildernes, And fand þam fode in þair nede, Wit-vten ani sau o sede; For drightin self þam send þair fode, þat fand þai neuer nan sua gode. It sneu to þam als it war flur, Of honi it had likest sauur. þis mete þat þai war fed of þaa, þai cald it in þair langage, manna; It come at morn and euening, Volatil sent þaim þat king:— þat king aght man to leue and lute, Wit al wirscip to mensk and dute! Want of water was in þat land, Moyses on þe roche kan stand, &amp; smat it wit þis forsaid wand, And vte als burn it brast þe strand; þar had þai water in wildrin land, Plente bath to fote and hand. Bot for all þir dedes gode þat drightin þam did o þair fode, þir Iuus þat o will war wlanck, þai cund him ai ful litell thanck; For if þair tunges spac resun, þair hertes ai war wit tresun. [The Battle with Amalek.] In þat si-quare þat i of speck, Was a lauerding hight amalec, þat on þam faght, and þai on him, In a sted hight raphidim. Moyses þan cald sir iosue, And mad him maister o þat semble, “Cheues þe,” he said, “wit man an freck And ga fight a-pon amalec, And i sal on yon hill stand, And godds yeird hald in mi hand.” To þis fight þai went þam son, Bot moyses, ur, and aaron, Went þan vp a-pon þis hill, In hope allan o godds will. Quils moyses heild vp his hend It was wel in þat bateil kend, For ai to-quils witerli Had godds folk þe hale maistri; Bot if he þam slaked ani sith, Sir amalech wan als suith.

Ietro, þe prist of madian, þat was moyses kynnes-man, Quen he hard how þai had don Tuix israel and pharaon, To spec wit moyses he cam, And broght him his wijf sephoram, Wit his tua suns þat sco beir, Gersau and eliezer. þis ilk folk was vntelland, þat moyses had vnder hand, þai did him selcuth sore trauail, Til þat ietro gaue him consail Vnder baillis for to sett, Quar thoru in right þai suld be gett, In smale wranges þat þar war; And to þaa þat gret birþin bar, Namli þat fel to gastli-nes, Suld vissed be thoru moyses. þan bigan þat folk to sai To moyses, “ga get vs lai.” Moyses said þan, “þat es right, We sal it ask vr lauerd dright. Bot fast behouus yow and me.” “And howlang sal þe terme be?” “þe terme it sal be fourti dais, To-quils i ga at gett yur lais Vp hei on mont synai.” “Sir, [ya],” þai said, “ful blethli.” [Moses and the Ten Commandments.] Moyses went vp-on þat fell, And fourti dais can þer-on duell, þe quilk he fasted, als we rede, To get lagh his folk wit to lede. þan come vr lauerd til him onan, And taght him tables tuain o stan, Wit his comamentes ten, And bad vn-do þam til his men.

[The people set up a golden calf.] Quils moyses him was a-wai, þaa fraward folk, wit-vten fai, Said þat moyses was slain, Ne suld he neuer cum again. And oþer-sum said þat he Was liuand, and in liue suld be. þai samed þam and drogh to rede, Mak þam a godd o gold sa rede, And said þaa sottes þam o-mang, “Sua stalworth sal he be and strang þat he sal hald vs hale and fere, And warn vs fra ilkin tor-fere, Quen manna sal vs wan be, He sal quete find vs gret plente.” Suilk was þair gile o-mang þair gamen, þair gold in tresur gadrid þai samen, A goldin calf þar-of þai blu, And als a godd honurd it neu. “Vr godd,” þai said, “þis ilk es he þat brogh vs thoru þe liuerd se, Fra pharaon and his pouste, þar-for we rede he mensked be.” þis moyses was ful dern and dere To drightin, man mai find it here, He taght him tabels o þe lai, Als ye herd me forwit sai. Quen he him taght suilk a relik, “þi folk,” he said, “has don a suik, Sin þat þou com fra þam last, þou sal þam find ful vn-stedfast.” Lauerdinges, to þis fait-les lede Manna fel, als yee herd rede, þat fel fra lift sa gret plente, Als a grideld frost to se, Quils moyses him hild awai For to do þam haf þair lai; Bot sum o þaim þis fast forsoke, And þai þis riche manna toke, And vnder erth in hepes it hide, Vt ouer þe forbot sua þai dide. If þai war þat tim sa vn-wise, Yeit er þai noght all skilwise. Moyses com fra þat fell, Son he herd tiþand tell þat his folk had ful il don, þar-of he had takning son. Quen he was cummen in to desert þe calf he sagh þer set apert, He hard þe gret nois was þare Abute þis calf, þat mikel fare; He wex sua menged in his mode, þat he cuth sai ne il ne gode; Ne he ne wist queþer it bettur war To turn or winde him forþar mare. þe tables þat in hand he bare To pees he þam brak right þar And þar-wit for-þer-mar he yede, For to destru þair cursed hede. He sagh þam knele þis calf a-bute, Als godd him seluen leue and lute. “Quat es þis? hugat dele yee now? Es þis your godd þat yee on trow?” Quen þai war war o moyses þai fled a-wai, als in a res, Littel and mikel, less and mare, þe calf allan þai left þan þare. þan cald moyses þam to-gedir, “Lauerdinges, i am now cummen hider, I haue a-bute your errand ben, Qui fle yee fra me þus beden? Cums again, wit-vten dute, Haf yee þe dais al fasten vte þat i bad ar i ne went? Or halden els his comament? And qua has made yow þis calf here, þat yee sua mensked and haldes dere?

Manigath com after him, Troi was bi-gunnen in his time, Tene yeir had he þe folk in yeme, Siþen had tua suns þam to deme. Sarach, and wit him delbora, þai iuged fourti yeir or ma; þan was a sibile o libie, And appollo wit his melodie. After þam com Iedeon, þat wirscep in his time had don, þat wit thre hundret of his lede Slogh kinges four of haithen-hede, þat was oreb and salmana, Zeb and zebee þe oþer tua.

Siþen ledd þat folk thola, Lastand tuenti winter a[nd] ma; þan ras þe thrid sibila, þat man cleþis delphica, O troi and grece þe batel bald, þis sibile mikel forwit sco tald. Als lang þan was him, sir Iair, þair leder and þair maister mair; In grece þan regned priamus, Als ald stori telles vs. In þis ilk Iairs time, Was letters funden o latine. Septe first þai heild bastard, And siþen he held sex yeir þair ward; Zamazims þat sith be-gan, þe wimmen land wit-outen man.

Achialon com aftirward, þair leder was, and þair stiward, He has þat folk ten winter gett; In þis man time was troi vmsett. Labdon þan had þam vnder-hand, Was ouerman aght yeir lastand, In his time was troi nomyn, And thoru þe grece ouercomyn; þat mani modir son was feld, Als it es in þe stori teld. þe wer lasted sa long a pece, þat þar was slain o þam o grece Aght hundret sith sexti sexti and ten, O thusands seresith o þair men, Sex hundret four scor sex thusand, O men o troi faght for þair land.

And al þe chesun o þat strijf, Was for rauising of a wijf, Al for fairhede of helain, þan war sa mani thusand slain. [Of Samson and his strength.] Eftter him, þis ilk labdon, þair dempster was sir sampson, þat was sa bald and wight and strang; Barnles was his moder lang, And in hir heild, thoru grace o dright, An angel has þis barn ham hight þat thoru his hare þat was wight, þat he had tuenti mens might. Vnder philistiens þan war þe Iuus halden, þat si-quar. Sampson soght chesun o strijf, O philistiens he wal[d] ha wijf, Apon a dai he went and sagh A fair womman was o þair lagh, He tald his frendes son on-nan þat he had chosen suilk a womman, And tok þam wit him for to proue, For to gette hir til his be-houe, If hir freindes him wald hir yate. Als he went walkand be þe gatte, A lion quilpe þat ran ouer-thuert, Rampand to sampson he stert, Sampson slogh þat leon kene, Godds grace was in him sene. Quen þat he had his errand dune, Again homward he went als sune, And bot a littel term was gan, Yod he to take him his lemman. And als he went þat gat again, In leon muth he fand, was slain, A bike o bees þar-in be-bredd, And wit þe hony he him fedd; His wijf fader and moder he gaue O þis hony at ete þe laue, Bot noght he did þam vnderstand, Hugat he þat hony faand. At þat fest war he was stadd, A redel þam vndo he badd, And hight þaa men to giue þair mede, If þai cuth right þat redel rede; þat ilk mede þai suld him hight, If þai ne it rede in seuen night. ‘Of þe etand þe mete vt sprang, And þe suete vte o þe strang.’ þis it was quen þai had soght, And stodid thre dais, al for noght, þai bisoght his wijf þat sco Suld gar him til hir it vndo. Vn-to þat birde was biddand bald, Sampson al þe soth hir tald, And sco til all þat hir was kidd Til þas oþer sco it vndidd,— And þat was mikel vnleute, To tell hir husband priuete. Sampson was wrath, his wijf for-soke, And sco an-oþer husband toke. Quen sampson þar-of hard sai, “Nu,” he said, “forth fra þis dai Agh i for to haue na wite, To do philistens despite.” Thre hundreth fox he samun knitt, (I wat noght hu he on þam hitte) Vn-to þair tails fir he band, Foluand ilk fox a brand, And in þe philistiens land, Thoru þe feldes alsua rennand, [When corn was] ripe he late þam rin, And sua þair corns did he brin, þair oliues, wit þair vintres, þe foxs brint al wit þat bles. þe philistiens þan went þam vte, And soght þan sampson al abute, þe Iuus was þan þair vnder-lute, Sampson bunden þai yald for dute, þe philistiens, wit-vten les, Ran on sampson in a res; Bot sampson, þat was selcuth smert, Vte o þair handes son he stert, And gaue a-braid sa fers and fast, þat all þe bandes of him brast. Thoru chance he fand an assban,— For oþer wepen had he nan,— O þat heþen folk he feld A thusand þat wit tal was teld. Siþen he went vntil a tun, Til a wijf þat was commun, Biside hir al þe night he lai: þe philistiens quen þai herd sai, þai vmbisett þat tun a-bute, þat if sampson went oþer vte On nighter-tale, or in morning, To derfly ded þai suld him bring. Bot sampson, þat was selcuth wight, Vp he ras midward þe night, And bar þe yates o þe tun, And laid þam on a hei dun. Siþen he ches a wijf to wale, Dalidam, him broght in bale. þe philistiens, sa ful o strijf, þai hight to dalida his wijf Gyftes gret al for to frain Quar was sampson might and mayn. Sua lang sco frain him, þat bald, þat suilk a gabing he hir tald, “Wit seuen sinous wa sa me band, I tint my strenth o fote and hand.” His faas stilli sco badd ta kepe, And band him quils he was on-slepe, And þan opon his faas sco cald, To do wit him wat þai wald. Bot sampson wakken[d] of his slape, O bandes let he-self him scape, His bandes al he brac in tua, Als þai had ben made bot on stra. Bot yitt his wijf wald noght fin Thoru egging of his wiþerwin, Til sco þe soth had gert him sai, In quat stede al his strencth lai. “Quar es þi strencth, leif?” said sco, “quare?” “It es,” he said, “al in mi hare; War mi hare schorn, i war noght þan Stranger þan a-noþer man.” Nu has sampson bikend his liif In will to weld, al of his wijf, Was neuer als now sampson in wath, His liue, his ded, now has sco bath, Bath in hir will now has he don, þat sal on him be sene ful son. Sampson, þi first wijf lerd þe witte, If þat þou cuth haf halden it! þis wijf alsua, þat þou has now, If þou ne war sua lightli to tru! Sare man aght to dred þe brand þat brint him forwit in his hand, Bot herd it es to stand again þe wijf þat fines noght to frain, For noiþer for luue dredes, ne au, Dos man his priuetes to scau; Or drunkennes oftmai bitide Dos man his consail to vn-hide, þat oft in faand man findes sua, Man priueest es mast man faa, Ne þare es nan sa gret mai greif Als traitur dern and priue theif. Als sua sco, dame dalida, Of al wicke ai worth hir waa? Hir lauerd consail all to þaa Sco tald þat heild him mast for faa. Hir time sco soght, bad þam be nere, Quils sampson slepped, sco laght a schere, His hare sco kerf, wa worth hir hend! And till his foos sco him be-kend. Al moght þai þan do quat þai mint, For thoru his fax his force was tint, And did him selcuth mikel lath, þai blinded him and prisund bath. And quen he was don in prisun, A man son o þat ilk nacion Gun dalidam hijs wijf at wedd; Sampson was to þe bridal ledd, For he was sle on harpingleu. Wit þis his [hare] was waxen neu; Bi a piler was he þar sett, To gleu þaa gomes at þair mete. Quils þai war blithes[t] at þat fest, Sampson cuth welle of ald gest. Wexen was sumdel his hare; þe post þat al þat huse vpbare Wit bath his handes he it scok, Sua fast þat al þe hus quok, þat hus he feld, gaf naman grith, And slogh his faas, him-self þar with. After sampson al-þer neist Was heli dempster, þe preist, þat þof he-self was clene o sin, For last of his suns tuin þe quilk he wist and chastid noght, þair sinn of him-self was boght. For quils he left at ham for eild, þai went to fight a-pon þe feld, Wit oþer fele þar war þai slain, And godds hali ark was tan. His hernpan he brak wit chance, Vr lauerd it sent him for wengance. þai mai dred saand suilk vnsele, þat chastes noght þair childer wele, For oft on fader falles þe wrak þat sent es for þair childer sake. Fourti yeir dempt he israel, And after him comme samuel, He was a selcuth dughti thing, þe first þat [enoynted] man to king. [Samuel anoints Saul and David.] Prophet he was, sir samuel, Wel luued wit godd, for he was lel. þe Iuus, wit þair mikel pride, Efter him þai sent þat tide, “Lauerdinges,” he said, “sais me quartill Haf yee me fott? quat es your will?” “Gett vs a king.” “quat, er yee wodde!

Noght yow allan, bot your oxspring, Sal reu ful sare your will ?erning, For it es wel worthye þat qua Mai bere no wel ne thole na wa.” Sare weped samuel wit þis, Til him com drightin, lauerd o blis, And thris he cald on samuel, “Lauerd,” he said, “i here þe wel.” “Mi folk,” said drightin, “ful fraward þai seke þam-self o a gret ougard, þai ask now oþer king þan me, Ful ilhail sal þai it se; þat þai desire, þai sal it haue, To þair aun heued a staue. Omang þir puple sal þou latt A stalworth man þat saul haitt, Wit hei schuldres bath thik and brade, Of him þan sal þair king be made, Sin þai ha þus forsaked me, He sal be [enoynted] þair king to be.” Son þai did saul be soght, Funden and forth was he broght, He was hegher þan ani man Bi þe schuldres þat was funden þan. þis saul haue þai mad þair king, Wit smerl and als wit coruning. Ful wreþer hail to þair be-houe And sun on þam sa gun it proue, For was þar þan na langer bide, Men werraid þam on ilka side, þat þai wit-in a tuel-moth stage, War put vte o þair heritage. þan bigan þai cal and cri, þat godd o þam suld ha merci; And samuel, þat wist þair wa, Cald on godd for þaim al-sua. Drightin said, “þou fill þi horn Wit oile, and weind þe forth to morn, Vntil a man þat hatt iesse, In bethleem sal he funden be. þou sal him find in bethleem, Seuen suns he has to barntem, On o þaim þou sal ma king, For saul dredes me na thing:— For-þi wit caitiuete and care He sal vte o þis werld fare, For ar þat he be slain in wer þe find he sal in bodi ber, þat him sal trauail dai and night, And laithli sal his licam dight.” “Parfai, lauerd,” said samuel, “Ic herd noght o þat iesse tel, Ne his suns ne him i knau, þat childs nam yee will me scau.” “Yijs,” he said, “i sal þe ken To knau him a-mang oþer men, In visage es he bright and clere, In red of heu, o laghand chere; His fader in all has suns seuen, þe yongest es he þat i þe neuen, Bath wis and hend, and o god fame.” “Quat hatt he?” “dauid es his name. And for þat he es warr and wis, I haue him chosen to þis seruis; His sede and his barntem Ouer al men i sal maintein, His faas sal noght a-gain him wail, For him ne his sal i noght fail. Vn-to king þou sal him smer Mi beniscun þan sal he ber.” Samuel went secand þe land Til he þe hus o iesse faand, Iesse him vnderfang ful fair, And samuel him tald his air. “Cummen i am,” he said, “iesse, An o þi suns for to se.” “Sir,” he said, “and þat mai yee, Your word es commament to me.” His suns sex þat war at hame, All he did þam call be nam Bot þe yongest þat was a-wai, “Sir,” he said, “sir iesse, sai Quar es þin alþer-yongest son?” “He es,” he said, “þar he es won, Wit our scep apon þe lau.” “Do fott me him, him wald i knau.” þai did him fott, and he come skete, And hailsed hendli þat prophete. He kneu him quen he him beheild, Bi takens was him forwit teld. [Enoynted] he was wit-vten bade, And king vte-ouer þe Iuus made. Bot þof he þar was [sm]erld king, O þe kingrike al gouerning He entir-mett him in na dede, Bot til his schepe again he yede. Godds gast in him was sent Fra þan it was fra saul went; Dauid cuth on sere-kin note Bath he cuth on harpe and rote, Quen he wit his gleu him gammen, His scepe þam-self war sembel samen Of his suete gleuing for to here, þe men was won to drau ham nere. Saul was yeitt in sted o king, Bot he moght do na gouerning, þe find was in his licam fest, He thold him to haue na rest. þan said þai all, “quat sal we do Wit vr king, mai haf na ro, He es ai vte o wite als wode. Hu sal we meke his menged mode? He es sua ful o wickedhede, Ful waful lijf we wit him lede.” þan spak a godman on þat throm, “Bot do we littel dauid cum, Wit his harp, be-for þe king; We sal him do bath gleu and sing þat quils he til him tas kepe þe king he sal do fall on-slepe.” Forth þan did þai dauid bring, Gleuand he sang be-for þe king, And gert him wit his melodi Fal on-slepe, þat was weri. Quil wit gleu, and quil wit sang, And þus he serued saul lang, þat ai quen he was trauaild mast Thoru a wreche vn-roful gast, And he bigan to gleu or sing, Of his vn-ro he tok lething. [David and Goliath; war with the Philistines.] to-quils come in philistiens, þair felun faas þat war paens, þar oueral þe cuntre spredd, þai wasted godes and awai ledd. þai broght wit þam goli, þat eten, In fule hordom þan was he geten, Gret he was wit-all, and hei, And semed sathan on to sei Bituix his eien, thre fote brade, Ful lath it was his visage made. O bodi gret, o granis lang, Vnsternli semed he be strang, Sex eln and mare he had on hight, And was all armed for to fight. Of his metscip was mesur nan, He wald ete seuen scep him an. “Quare es now,” said he, “saul þe king? Moght i euer wit me wit him ming Suld he neuer aftur ber cron, I suld him sla, bi sir mahun! Quine cums he-self, or send his saand? Wit him i wald mi forces faand, Or send me a man to me hidder, þat i and he mai fight to-gidder, And qua oþer ouer-cum in feild þe toþer folk al til him yeild. A man o þair gains an of vr, If vrs mai him win in stur, þat þai be vrs and þair airs; If þai win vrs þat we be þairs. And her i bede mi-self redi, For to fight for vr parti.” Ilk dai he come in place, And batail bede wit sli manace, Ai quen þat þe folk him soght sau þam stode of him ful mikel au. “Allas,” he said, king saul, þan, “Allas! quar sal we find a man þat dar þe fight, for mi sake, Again yon warlau vndertake? þe man þat him wald fight a-gain, And moght ouer-cum him wit his main, I suld him riche in all his lijf, And giue mi doghter him to wijf.” þis herd dauid, and forth can stand, “Sir king,” he said, “hald me couenand, I tru truli in godds might, þat i sal vnder-tak þe fight, Agains yon gerard þat es sa grim, Wit godds grace i sal sla him. Again yon wreche haiþen thing, For-soth haf i na dred, sir king; He traistes al in his aun hand, And ic in him es all weldand.” To dauid said saul þe king, “I hope þartil þou be ful ying, Yon es a stalworth batail wright, And þou lered neuer for to fight. If he sla þe, als god for-bede, All mon we hald of haþen lede. Quat bot to lese þi lijf, leue page, And we to þam ma siþen homage?” “Dowai,” sir king, “es noght to drede þat godd will help, dut es na nede Apon a dai mi scep i gette, A bere, a leon, bath i mete; I had na help bot me allan, And drightin þat me lent his lan; þai soght me for to ren[d] and riue, And i laid hand on þaim be-liue, And scok þam be þe berdes sua þat i þair chafftes raue in tua, Wit-vten glaiue or suerd or knijf, Bath i refte þam þair liue. He þat me þar þe maistre gaue, He me do it here to haue. It es noght worth, leif sir king, þat man in godd haue mistrouing.” “Ga þan,” he said, “in godds grith, þat he-self ai be þe with, Gaes and fottes me in hij, Mine aun armur to child daui.” Helm and hauberc on him þai did, And gird him wit a suerd emid; Quen þat dauid was armed sua, Forth a fote ne moght he ga, Ne forþerward ne yeitt o bake, Bot þar he stod als still os stake. His arms fra him did he suing, And tok bot a staf and a sling þat he was wont to bere in hand, Abute his flock o scep walcand. He tok fiue stans rond o quin, And put þam in his scrip wit-in. “Dos awai,” he said “þis gere, Certes can i nan armes bere; Bot wit mi sling i sal him fell, Do ga we forth, wit-vten duell.” Quen dauid went him forth in route, He sagh þe folk, þai war in dute, For to gar þam wit hope to bald, þus he þam his resun tald. “Qui suld man,” said he, “be sua radd þat es in rightwis batail stadd, And qua-sa fightes in wrangwisnes, Him helpes noght his Irinnes, For noiþer irin, ne yeitt ne stile, Mai wer man wrangwis werkes wele. For godd es euer on rightwis side, Werraiand again wrangwis pride. All yee wat we haue þe right, For-þi sal drightin for vs fight, He sal vs now helpe wit his grace,” Wit þis he come vnto þe place. Quen golias on him bi-held, Ful littel tale of him he teld, Bot held him als for in despite, And þus bigan on him to flite. “Quat! wynsþou i am a hund, Wit þi stans me for to stund? Cum forth wreche, wit-vten bade, þi flesche sal foghul fud be made.” Dauid ansuard, “if godd wil, nai!

[Saul is jealous of David.] Dauid went ham wit gret honur, And thanked godd, þair creatur, And mikel he was, þe soth to sai, Loued and dred forth fra þis dai. Wit yong and ald, wit pour and rike, þai louued him all o þat king-rike. To iursalem þat heued bar þai, þai karold wimmen be þe wai, O þair karol suilk was þe sang, þat þai for ioi þam sang a-mang, “Saul has smitten a thusand, Ten thussand fel in dauid hand.” For þis word was saul wrath, For oft sith was he bremli brath. “I haue a thussand feld, hou sua! And dauid has ten thusand ma! Quat of al es nou him wan, Bot þat he es noght king allan.” For los þat dauid wan þat sith, Wald neuer saul lok on him blith; He dred his kingdon to lese, at þai to king suld dauid chese, He hated him als his ful fa, Fra þan he waited him to sla; Oft sal be quit þam on þis wise, þat to liþer lauerd dos seruise. þe toþer morn her after-ward þe warlau trauail saul fulhard, Als he was won bi-gan to rage, And als dauid him come to suage, þe king til him wit a sper In breth he wald him thoru ber. þat thoru he had his bodi born, If he ne had blenked him be-forn. Awai þan drou him son daui, Bot saul dred him no for-þi, And of a thusand men o wal, He made him ledder and marscal, And thoght, and þus said in his mode, “þat i him sla, it es noght god, Bot elles i sal him lat al-an, Philistiens sal be his ban.” He asked dauid if he wald His doghter wedde, to haue and hald, To þe conuenand for to bring An hundreth hefds to þe king O þat folk þat was þar fede; Dauid yod forth with drightin rede.

Again a hundret þat saul soght, Dauid him þar þe dubul broght; þe king his doghter him gaue onan þat hight micol, a fair womman. þe king sun, hight ionathas, To dauid tru felau he was, þan bade þe king [wha] moght ouerta, His magh dauid man suld him sla; To seke him als his ful faa; þar-for was Ionathas ful wa, And paind him, wit al his maght, To mak þe king and dauid saght. Bifor þe king he dauid broght, Bot efter son was alfor noght. Son efter þis a batail ras, And dauid went a-gain his faas, [þi]s batail it was hard i-nogh, [And] dauid fast on his faas slogh.

Bot yeit þe warlau þat was wont Trauail þe king a litel stunt, Dauid him gleud wit his harp, þe king þan hent a sper scarp To stair him thoru vnto þe wau; Bot dauid sagh, and blenked lau. In-til his hus þan dauid fledd, Bot ar þe king wald ga to bedd, He sent his men his hus a-bute At wait þe morn quen he com vte, Him to sla if þai moght mete; Bot micol vte bi night him lete, Vte at a priue dern postel, And he him fledd to samuel, þat duelland was in ramatha.

O-mang his kin in priuete, Als he war vtelau, sua wond he; þe god men thoght, o þat cuntre, þair suns send wit him to be. Saul him soght oft her and þar, Als þof his wiþerwin he war, He wist if he to lijf moght stand He suld be king ouer al þat land, And childer of his aun sede, Suld be for-driuen vte wit nede. For-þi he hight þam giftes rijf, þat suld bring dauid of his lijf. In feild and tun, in frith and fell, Saul soght dauid for to quell; þat oft þe chances sua þai fell, þat neli was þam noght e-mell. And dauid, þat was mild o mode, Again il ai wroght he gode, þat oftsithes moght he him ha tan, And if he wald him might ha slan; For fra þe kings aun bedd þus he broght a priue wedd. In þat si-quar þat he him soght Wit all þe mightes þat he moght, He sett his tentes in a dale, þar of him tald dauid na tale. Quen it was naght þan cald daui, An of his aun al priueli, Wit him allan stilli þai went, Vn-to þe kings aun tent, þe king and all his folk þai fand, In þair beddes ful fast slepand. þe squier hight abysai, þat to þe tent com wit daui, “Sir,” he said, “wit þe leue o yow, I wil him sla ful eth es now. Thoru his licam i sal him smit, þat euer o him þou sal be quit.” Dauid þan said, “drightin for-bede þat þou suld thinc to do suilk a dede, Or euer him do despit or scam, þat drightin smerld has in his nam.” Of al þat ilk kings ger, Bot a cupe he tok and a sper, Na mar broght he wit him vte, þan slep þai al was him a-bute. Sua yod he forth, nan moght him der, þan he cried vnto þat her, “How ha yee gett your king,” said he, “His cupe, his sper, lok quar þai be, þat war bath don at his heued, Lokes nou þar if þai be leued.” Quen king saul had herd þat cri, “Es þat,” he said, “mi sun daui?” “Ya, soth,” said dauid, “it es i, Quarfor me sekes þou, and qui? Gladli wald i be on-knaun Qui sekes þou me þat es þi naun?” “Soth,” said saul, “wit-vten wene, þe mis es min, þat es wel sene.” “Nou her i leue þe kinges glaiue, Yee send a man at it receiue, He þat al rightes wit na ros Sal ilk man yeild after he dos.” Son efterward, it was not lang, Gain saul þai gaf batail strang, þaa sarzins þan þe king vm-sett, In hard strur þai samen mett, Ful snaip it was þair stur and snell, þe folk al fled of israel. þar þai fell þat moght not fle, O-pon þe mont o gelboe, Dughti berns was þer slan, þe king suns and Ionatan. O þis batail þat was sa snell, þe force a-pon þe king it fell, Mani gode archer þan was þar þe king saul was wonded sare. þan said þe king til his squier, þou dragh þi suerd and sla me her, Or þat i be, mai fall, ouertan, Wit hand o sarzin and slan. þe squier did noght als he badd, For he-self first was selcuth radd, þan drogh saul self his suord And ran him-self a-pon þe ord. Quen his squier him sagh þus ded, He did him-self þat ilk red, Apon his aune suerd he res.

Suilk was þe sueuen þat him thoght, Bot o þe baruns wist he noght, þat þai sli wandes fand or soght, Or elles in þat contre? broght. He wok, a[nd] thoght al on þat sight, And said, “our lauerd godd all-might, Sua hale quin war i and sua light Als me thoght i was to night.” Vnnethes had he moned his mode, þat a lem fra þe wandes stode, Right vnto þat hermitage, þe king com to and his barnage: Son quen þai mete wit þis heremit, þai hailsed him, wit-vten lijt, And þair hailsing þai til him tald, Ful hendeli to þam he yald, Alsuith sum he þat king had knaun, He said, “sir welcum to þin aun, Thoru þe,” he said, “sal þis mesele, Be sauf and sund of al vn-hele. Mi thoght to night on þis-kyn wise, þat we war bath in paradise, And þat þou wit þir wande wess All þe vnserenes o mi fless, þat als a fische þou made me fere, Wit branches þat þou beres here.” þe tres he keist and kneled þare, He was haler þan euer are. þe king þat kind was of his cost, þe man he ledd forth wit his ost, And all his lijf did wit him leng, For he was a ful dughtithing. Knight he was o gret empris, He quitt þe king will his seruis. þe king forth fard þat he ne fan, Til he come gain to flun iordan. He tok þaas wandes in his hand, þe strem all still began to stand. It stode þe folk on aiþer side þe kinges passage for to bide. Quen þai war passed ouer strand, And raght a-pon þe toiþer land, Witte yee þat þai war ful gladd; To þe folk þe king þan badd, Ilkan to sett þair pauilun, Als for þat night vte-wit þe tun; þan on þe morn, quen dai suld lem, Vn-to þe tun of ierusalem He suld þam bring, to set in ward Wit-in his aun orchiard, To-quils wald he mak him bun At ordain þar procession. þai rest þam þat night and bade, O þaa wandes grett lose þai made. þe king abute þam was ful gern, And putt þam in-til a cistern, And did biside þam lampes light And men þam for to kepe þat night, To-quils þat he him went to slepe. Bot godd, þat all has for to kepe, þat all for-lokes in his sight, His will witstand es nan has might, It es na thing þat mai for-barr His will þat forwit es sua warr, He þat sua mighti es and wis, He did þaa vandes forto ris; In þat cistern þe rotes fest, Sua depe þair rote þai samen kest, þat moght þam naman þeþen win, Wit-vten rift for ani gin. Quen dauid sagh nan oþer bote, Bot þat þai wandes tane hade rote, þat fest war in erth sua fast, In his hert he was agast, And said, “all naciun and lede Aght vr lauerd for to drede, For he es mightful in mikel dede, At al his will in werck to spede. Sal nan,” he said, “þam heþen stere, Sin godd self has sette þam here.” þan dide þe king tilward þat side þat orchiard al for to wide, A wall a-bote dide for to rais, And planted tres þat war to prais, O cedre, o pine, and o lorrer, þat yaird suld be him-self ful dere. And oþer riche tres he soght In mani sted, and þeder broght; All frutes he plantede in þat place, For his schirting and his solace. Quen all was closed a-boute þat tre, A siluer cercle son naild he, þat was þe stouen for to strength, And knau þe wax o gret and length.

In bede als he lai on a night, Be-for him stod an angel bright, And til him spak wit blithful chere, And said, “i am a messager, Mi lauerd þe has word send wit me, And gis þe chose o thinges thre, O strenght, o riches, or o wijt, Chese quilk þou will, þou sal haue it. If þou wit hert him serues hale, O þir þou sal haf on to wale.” Salamon þis vnderstode, O þis bodword thoght him ful god, “Wijtles,” he said, “quat es catell, Or quat es strenght wit for to dele Man þat na wijt has him to lede? I chese me wijt for al mi nede. I thanc him me þis chos wald giue, I sal him serue quils i mai liue, Wit al mi might, in al mi will, He giue me grace it to fulfill.” þe angel said to salamon, “Wisli þou has in chesing don, And for þou wel has chosen an, In weild þou sal ham haf ilkan. For þou sal be ful warr in dede, And ale folk þar-for sal þe drede. And þou sal dred-nes haf o nan, O riches sal þou haf god wan.” þan regn[d] salamon wit þis, And ledd his lijf wit mikel bliss. He luued þe folk of his kingrike, And all luued him, bath pouerand rike; All þat euer him rais again, Wit wisdom he broght þam to reclaim. And al þat fader his ne moght, Salamon til end he broght; Ierusalem mast he luued of all, þar was he sett in king stall. [The judgement of Solomon between the two women.] In his kingscip þe fourte daus, O-mang his folk he sett his laus, And did þam strattli for to yeme, Moght naman rightwisliker deme. Amang his rightwisdomes rijf, Herkens hu he feld a strijf. O mister was þer wimmen tuin, þat ledd þar lijf wit sike and sin, For þai had husing nan to wale, þai lended in a littel scale.

Quen þai war all be-for him þare, First spac sco þat þe quik child bare; “Sauf,” sco said, “be king salamon, þat semeli sittand es in tron!

Quarfor me think sua, if yee rede, þe child be nawight don to ded, Bot he be yoldon to yond wijf, þat wil sua gladli saue his lijf. For sco þat has his lijf sua dere, His moder es, wit-vten were.” “þis dome,” þai said, “es ful rightwis,” All loued þai salamon þe wis; Hir barn sco tok and went hir hame.

[The building of the Temple.] Quen salamon was wel at es, And al his kingrik wel in pees, þan he can him entermet þe temple mak, he was in dett, þat his fader him of be-soght. Bot ferli of a thing him thoght, Quils he was timberand to þis thing, To-quils þis tre bigan to cling, þis tre i haf of forwit taald, Nu it be-gan to wax wel ald.

Quen þai had soght and moght not sped, “Sir king,” he said, “we dut vr dede Sal perijs, and leif all be-hind, For a tre þat we mai not find.” Wit þis þai lete þair werc to hon, And spak þan to king salamon, “Sir,” þai said, “durst we for auu, Vr thoght gladli we wald þe scau, We haf soght forest bath ner and ferr For to sek a maister sparr, For to fest, wit compas slei, Vr warc to-geder, bath lau and hei. If we durst sai þe, liue sire, þat þou þarfor lepe not in ire, þe tre þat es in orchiard þin, Wald bring vr werc ful wel to fin.” þe king o þis tre vnder-stode, Almast menged him his mode, Ne for-þi þe tre he yatt Quen he moght pass nanoþer gatt. Son þe tre was heun dun, And squir on-laid and scantliun, þe tre was als mete and quem, Als animan þar-to cuth deme. Bot quen it vp was broght wit strengh, It wanted large an eln on lenght, þai lete it don wit-vten lett, And fand it merc inogh wit mett, Vp þai lifted oft-sith þe tre, It was to scort gret quantite. þus þai fanded it tre dais, Als it in þe stori sais, Bot for na beting þat þai bedd, Ne moght þai do it stand in stede. Bot quen þai sagh þar na bote els, þai went to seke in frith and fels, To find a-noþer tre wald þai And þai it fand þe first dai; þat ilk dai þat it was funden, þe balk was in his birþen bunden. þis tre þai tok þan o cipres, And did in wirscip and in pes, In þat hali temple grith, And þe thritte cercles wit,— þat king dauid, þat was sa god, Did þar a-bote to-quils it stode To wijt hu þat it gru be yere,— And offerd þam als tresur dere, To haf o þat tre lastand min O for-besening þat þar was in. Att te temple for þis resun, þai ar wit tresur don commun, Ne war þai neuer þeþen spend Til þat þai war iudas bekend. Til him þan war þai taght and tald, Quen he for þaim his lauerd sald. And þus sais sum opinion, Bot sua sais noght þe passion. And þat tre þan ful richeli Was in þat temple dun to li, þat was þar neuer þar-of mad oght, Til þat þe croice þar-of was wroght. þis kirc was wroght o marbel stan, Suilk a-noþer in werld was nan, Als was þis temple salamon; þair-in þan was þair relikes don.

Bot fastand had he lang noght bene, Quen him was sent an angel scene, þat wit þe light he ledd wit him Was glopind al, sir Ioachim! For þat bright-nes was he sa radd, þat he stode still als he war madd, Bot þis angell þat bi him stode, Broght him suilk a tyþand gode, “Ioachim,” said he, “þou ma god cher, I am vr lauerd messager, Nu am i hidir to þe send, þi murnand cher al for to mend; For þat he hard has þi praiyer Nu he þe sendes þis ansuer, þi brixel, bale, and þin vpbraid, þat isacar þe prist þe said: þof þou na child haf hider-till It es noght tid þe for þin ill, þof godd vmquil be funden still, Al mai he wirk þou quat he will.

Quen iohn was born, þat ilk siþe, His frendes was ful gladd and blipe, And had of hir ful mikel mirth, þat was sua lang wit-vten birth, Noght allan ierusalem burgh, Bot elles al þe contre thurgh.

Quen circumcised was sant Ion, His fader had his spece onan, And suilk a propheci can mele— “Blisced be godd of israel þat visiting his folk has sent, And raunconing til his has lent.” þis barn was ai fosterd dere; Quen he was syþen o seuen yere He left bath kiyth and kyndli thede, And to þe wildernes he yede, For-þi þat he wald fle fra sin, He left his kyth and al his kin.

[The Beginning of Christ's Ministry.] Iesus þat well wist o þis strijf, Quarfor sant ion was don o lijf, To þe Iues þat war felun In his louing he made sermon. Fra nazareth to capharnaum, Fra neptalim to zabulon, Went he prechand o þe fai. In aueril þe toþer dai Was þat he bigan to preche, And openli þe folk to teche. þe sinagogs all soght he Ouer-all þe land of galilee; Of his sermun spac mani man, And oþer mani loueword he wan. Quen he herd tel sant Iohn was slain, To nazareth he went again, Vntil his aun kind contre, Tua dais in aueril entre. He sermund wit his loueli spek, And heild mani þat war seke, þe sam-hale fast til him þai soght, þair heling groched he þam noght, Leche to þam was he ful hold, He asked noþer siluer ne gold. [Christ chooses the Apostles.] þan thoght iesus it was to lang Wit-vten felauscip to gan, Nu ches felaus wil he bigin, Bot noght o riche kinges kin, Ne of erel þan gret baron, Ne oþer gret lauerding o tun.

Tua breþer first, petre and andreu, Bath þai war o mild theu, Hade þai þam first nonoþer godd, Bot wit þair scipp þai fand þam fode, Wit þair fissing war þai fedd, And pouer liuelade þar-wit þai ledd. Wit a word þai left þair scipps tuin, For þat was al þair werld win, Neuer siþen went þai þair mode, For þam thoght þair change gode. At see sant Iohn and Iam he fand, Quils þai þair lines war waitand, Fader and moder and all þair kin And schipp þai left and felud him. þan com til him Iudas thadeu, And broght wit him sant bartillmeu; Siþen he com in til a bi Amor[n]ing fand he dan leui, O puplicane lede was he, And als a man o gret pouste.

Siþen simon and als iudas, þe less jam and sant Thomas, þan Iudas scarioth þe bald, þat at þe last þis lauerd sald. Tuelue þai war to tell in tale, Quen þat þai war to-gedir hale.

To petre þat he pouerest fand, Of all he mad him mast weldand, For-bi all his oþer feris, Mast priuelege he gaf to peris. To petre god said, “luues þou me?” “þou wat wel, lauerd, i luue wel þe.” “þou sal do þan mi comandment;” “Yaa, sir, gladli wit all mi tent, To dei for þe if it be nede.” “Mi schep,” said iesus, “sal þou fede.

And þar þat ani defaut bitidd Was noght his curtasi vn-kidd, þat he ne it sceud wit mani dedes, In mani stede wit mani medes, Als was befor þe archidicline, He turnd þe watur in to win.

Quen maria wist þair win was gan, Sco tald it til hir sun o-nan, And mildeli sco made hir man, “Leifsun,” sco said, “wine haf þai nan.” And til his moder þan said he, “Quat es þat to me and þe?

Iesus was þar he welk þe stret, Wit þis blind þar can he mete; Him asked his disciplis þan, “Lauerd,” þai said, “wat es þi nam, Or his eldres don bi-forn þat he þus-gat suld blind be born?” þan said iesus, “has noþer he þis, Ne als his oxspr[i]ng don þe mis, Bot for þat godds werckes mai In him be sceued fra þis dai. Mi fader werkes most i do To-quils þat i haf dai þar-to, Fra now behoues þe sun him spede For to do his fader dede.

And siþen he said til him, “leif freind, To natatorie nu sal þou wende, At natatori sylee þar sal þin eien wassed be.” He went and wess his eien þare, And tok his sight in þat siquare; Fra nu thar him namar be ledd, He com again þan to þat stedd.

Quen iesus lifted vp his heued, And sagh nan in þat temple leued, Biheld þis womman standard þar, þat caitiue carked in hir care, “Womman,” he said, “quar ar þai cummen þin wiþerwins þat þe had nummen?” Quackand sco loked hir a-bute, Iesus badd hir þan haue na dute; “Lauerd,” sco said, “all þai er a-wai.” “For-þi, womman, to þe i sai, Ga þe nu forth, mi lef freind, For þou has leue nu for to wend; I damp þe not quar-so þou far, Bot ga nu forth and sin na mar.” He said noght allan, “namar þou sin,” Bot “lok þi will bi noght þar-in.” A water þar es wit-in þair thede, þat es cald piscene in þair lede, þis ilk water als þe stori sais, Was mikel renumed in þaa dais, Als it war a gode vinere; þar-bi lai mani vn-fere, þar-in was won for to descend, Angels þe water for to blend, And tid it sua in þat siquar, Quen þis water all droue war, þe first seke man þat moght win In to þat wel to wassche him in, þat quat sekenes þar was on him, He suld be heled, fra þat tim.

Siþen sal yee here quat wise Ihesu did lazar to rise, Bot ar þat i sua ferr sal ga, I sal spek of his sisters tua, þat was martha, wit-vten lain, And als sua mari magdalain. þis lazar, als sais vs vr stori, Was of a stede hight bethani; He had þis forsaid sisters tuin, þe tan a womman ful o sin.

Quen iesus in his sete was sett, Wit his disciplis at þe met, þis sinful womman and for-lain, þis forsaid mari magdalain, Wit-in þis castel i of tald, Moght sco do all quat sco wald. þe man þat godd will þat be bett, Yee wat, lauerdings, mai nathing lett. þe word o ihesu was risen brade, And o meracles þat he made. Quen mari wist iesus þar cummen, A bost sco has o smerles nummen; A smerl þat was o pris ful dere, þis v?tement wit hir sco bere. Bot for mi tale scortli to tell, Be-for iesu on knes sco fell, þar-wit sco fell on suilk a grete, þat al sco was vr lauerd fete; On þaim sco wepe hir sinnes sare, And þan þam dries wit hir hare; þar sco fand ani breck or sare, Wit hir smerl sco smerd þare, Wit all wirschip þat sco him did, Euer sco kist his fete e-mid. All þai wondrid on þis mari, þai sagh hir neuer sa sari, Sco left hir dede for na scam. Simond þat sir was o þat ham, Wondre[d], and said in his thoght (Bot þou wit muth he said it noght), “If þis man war right prophet, þis womman wepand on his fete He aght to wijt al quat sco were, To lat hir negh him not sa nere, For sco es womman o sinful stat, Als men ouer al þis contre wat.” þan ansuard him sun iesus crist, Quat simon thoght, ful wel he wist, “Here to me,” he said, “a stund.” “Gladli, maister,” said symond. “It was a man quilum was wont Penis for to lene vm-stunt, þis man he was an okerer, And tua men com þat had mister, And asked him penis to lan; þis riche man lent to þat tan An hundreth penis, suilk als ran, And fifti to þe toþer man.

Martha and mari broþer he fand, Lazaruin þar was wonnand, He gestind wit þir sisters tua I neuend ar, mari and martha. Quen þai wist he suld wit þam duell, O þair gladnes war tor to tell, And na selcut, for suilk a gest Com neuer vn-to þair hus to rest.

Sir, yee bidd hir for to rise, And helpe us now in vr seruise.” “Martha, martha,” þan said iesu, “In mikel bisenes ert þou, Bise ert þou bot mani dede, Bot mast of an þou-queþer es nede; þe better lott has mari chosen, þat hir mai nagat be wit losin.” Blisced was þat affliccion þat mari broght to sli pardon, Alle thinges hali sco for-soke, Bot an of al thing sco hir tok, O mani thing sco tok til an, Wit-vten quam es beute nan.

Leue we nu o þis sisters þus, Al for to tell o lazarus. þis lazarus o betani Had sisters martha and mari, Mikel he luued his sisters bath, Ne soght he neuer man wit lath, A castel was bath his and þairs, Thoru eldres þar-of war þai airs. To þis castel was iesus cald Til herberi, als i for-wit tald, Soth it es, þis lazarus Was seke, als stori telles vs, In his sekenes he languist sua, þat he na fote had might to ga; Martha and mari þan was ful wa, For his vnhele and oþer maa, His sisters serued him to hand þat bunden lai in godds band, Bot bute til him þat sua was bunden, Mikel ha þai soght, nan haf þai funden, þof þai him soght fand na bott, þe sare him sekes fra hede to fote. Quen þai sagh þat þar was nanoþer Stat o couering o þair broþer, Consail þai tok iesum biseke, For þair broþer þat was sa seke, O þair broþer þai suld him sai He luued sa wele, in langur lai, To prai him, if his will it were, Cum se lazar þat was vn-fere; For wel þai turd þat he moght þair broþer sauue of al his soght. þe sandes soght ouer all Iude, Faand þai him noght in þat contre, And wat yee qui? for þis resun, þai soght him sla wit fals tresun. þof þai him faand noght in þat land, þai fined noght til þai him faand, þir messagers þair errand said Hendli, þatwas on þam laid; þai praid him als lauerd dere, For his freind þat was vn-fere, þat he til him a turn wald mak, For him, and his tua sisters sak. “He lijs to dei, þe lel and tru, Lauerd!” þai said, “of him þou reu!” To þaa men þat bodd-word bar Iesus þam gaf suilk ansuar, “Gais a-gain,” he said, “your wai, To þam þat yow sent sal yee sai þat þai noght for þair broþer murn, To ded sal noght his langur turn, Bot sal mi blis þar-wit be sene, Wel forþermar þan yeitt has bene.” Again þai went wit þair ansuar, Tua dais vr lauerd was lengand þar, þan did he his disciplis call, “Buskus yow,” he said, “yee sal Vnto Iude weind wit me nu.” And þai said, “sir, quat thinckes þou? Ne was þou noght bot littel gan Almast þar-wit þe juus slan? It es, sir, na consail o freind, þat þou þider-ward nu weind.” Iesus þan said, “qui sai yee sua? Ten tides has þe dai and tua, Qua has to wenden ani wai, God es to go bi light o dai, For qua walkes on nightertale O dreching oft he findes duale. Bot þat i sai, ta yee god kepe, Lazar vr freind es laid on-slepe, þat i til him weind it es time For to wacken him of his suime. I haf him luued well oftsiþe, And þat es right nu i him kiþe.” “Sir,” þai said, “if he slepe oght, Dute o ded yeit has he noght, If he mai slepe hele es at hand.” Iesus said, “miss yee vnderstand, For yee sal here noght lang þer-till Tiþand þat yow sal like wel il. For he es ded, þat i of sai, Nu es it gan þe firth dai, Ded and doluen bath es he. Es he noght quik, þat sal yee se; For þan es i nu gladd and blithe þat i was noght wit þaim þat sithe. Bot nu þan am i after send, þiderward nu will i wend.” Quen thomas, þat hight didimus, Hard þat ded was lazarus, Als his maister him tald, iesus, He sighed sar, and said þan þus, Til his felaus soruful said he, “Lauerdings,” he said, “þis here yee, Lazarus es noght o liue, Go we dei wit-him biliue; Neuer list me langer liue nu, Bot if we help haf o iesu. We sal find missing witerli Of vr god freind o bethani.” Tuix ierusalem and þis castell þat yee me herd of forwit mel, þare mare wond magdalene, War noght o miles bot fiftene, þar lazarus was doluen and ded. Iesus þan þider-ward him yede. Lazar was a heie-born man, His kin war yeit abute him þan, At þat castel his frendes bade, And for þair frend gret murning made; Wit mari and martha, it sais, þai had ben wepand þar four dais. þar was fele boden, als i tru, And mani als-sua vnbonden Iuu þider com, bath an an oþer, To comforth mari for hir broþer. Bi þis was cummen grait tiþand þat iesus cummen was nerhand, þat he was cummen into þat sted, Wit his felauscip þat he ledd. Martha was neuer half sua fain, Sco went þan wepand him again, To fete sco fele him sarili, Reuli on him þan can sco cri. “Leif lauerd,” sco said, “quat rede? Mi broþer nu es fra me ded. Allas, had þou her wit vs bene, Mi broþer had noght ben ded, i wen. O quatkin thing þou mas praier, I wat þat drightin wil þe here.” “Bi still,” he said, “þi broþer sal rise.” “Ya sal,” sco said, “on sumkin wis, On domes-dai, wel wat i quen, Rise sal he þan wit oþer men.” Iesus said, “i am vpris and lijf, Qua trous in me, or man or wijf, þof þai war ded yeit sal þai lijf, þat gift for-soth i sal þam gif. And all þat liues and troues in me, Ded ne sal þai neuer be. Trous þou þis?” sco said, “sir ya, I trou þis, and i trou alsua þat þou ert godds aun sun, Cummen amang vs for to won.” Martha, ful soruful and sari, Til hir sister sco tald mari, And in hir ere sco can to run, “Crist,” sco said, “es cummen to tun, Do þe to speke wit him in hi:” Wit-vten mare vp ras mari, Til-ward hir maister ran sco fast, Men wen[d]all sco had bene a-gast! Quen men hir sagh, þat bi hir stod, Rennand forth als sco war wod, Wijt yee for-soth o mani man þe teres o þair chekes ran. Til hir broþer graue sco gas, Oft sith for soru sco said “allas!” Bot mari was in a-noþer tent, Wit hir lauerd to speke sco went, For crist þat had his grace hir lent, Wit hir sister hir efter sent. Til him sco ran and fell on knes, “Lauerd,” sco said, “als þou nu seis, Ded es þi freind, my broþer lazar, And þar-for es mi hert ful sare.” “Had þou,” sco said, “ben here wit vs Had noght mi broþer deied þus.” Iesus biheild þan hir a-stert, And had gret reuthnes in his hert. Lazar freindes þat þar were, þai cried and mad a reuful chere. To mari iesus in hir care Mikel luue he hir sceud þar, Quen he him-self of hir misfare, A parti on him-seluen bare, For he wepe sarer þan þas oþer Wit þar tua sisters for þar broþer. Tenderli he wep, and said, “And quar haf yee his bode laid?” “Sir,” said mari, “cum forth and se, Ful mikel, lauerd, luued he þe. Lauerd, o selcut þat es slei, þi lufand þus, qui let þou dei?” Iesus þair waining vnderstod, Wit þaim sun to þe graue he yod, Quen he come þar, wit-vten hon, He bad þe graf suld be vndon, Of þe tumb tak of þe lidd, And son his commament þai did. þan said martha, “lauerd, i tru Wormes biginnes at ete him nu. He stinkes, for thre dais es gan Sin he was loken vnder þis stan.” þan said iesus, “martha, do wai, It es na wijt i here þe sai, Forgeten has þou son þi lare þat i þe said a littel are. If þou wald tru, ar said i þe þat son þou suld a selcut se, Quar-of suld rise a gret luue-word.” þe folk all gedird wit þis word, þe lid o tumbe awai þai lift, Iesus he loked vnto þe lift, Til fader his he made a bon. þe fader of heuen it herd ful son; “Honurd be þou, fader, euer and oft, Wit angels þine þar vp olof[t], þi sun þe thankes þou dun has send Of þe an haligast es kend. Fader, i wat i am o þe, And an ar we þou all thre; I haf tan flexs emang mine aun, And þof i am noght wit þam knaun.

At his bidding he ras on-nan, He þat ligand þar war in stan, In windingclath als he was wonden, Bath fete and hand þar was he bunden. “Louses him nu,” he said, “for-qui I wat he liues nu witterli.” þe folk said, þat þare stode e-mid, “Mikel frenscip has þou him kidd.” Fra þat dai forth tor war to tell þe folk þat foluand to iesu fell. Son oueral þis tiþand ras O lazar þat vpraisid was, I hop ferrer þat it was rijf þan it was forwit of his lijf. þir signes þat yee haf herd her, Yee aght, lauerdings, in hert to bere; Yee herd neuer nan slic, i wene, For quat þat selli suilk has sene, Do crepels gan, þe blind haf sight, Mesels þat war drerili dight, To hele sua mani a reuful wight; Qua dred ne troud noght his might, Ne heild noght wel þe reuel o right, I sai þat þai war maledight, And namli þaa þat has ben bun Quen he vpraised lazarum. Bot Iuus þat war fell and fals, þat aght him mensk and wirscip als, Als he þat born was o þair kin, And mast for þaim he com to win.

It es, lauerdinges, als we wat, Vr for-eldres þe bible wrat, God luued þe Iuus lang beforn þat his suet sun was born, And mikel luue to þaim has don, And liuerd þaim fra pharaon, Fra pharaon þat was sa strang þat þam in seruage held lang. He sent a man þam for to ledd, Fra amang þat cursed ledd, Moyses þe ald it was his nam, He led þaim thoru þe see fame; þis moyses was þair for-leder, And drund þe king, wit all his her. In wildirnes wit-vten suinc Bath he fand þam mete and drinc, þar he þam fedd wit angel mete, And o mani bale þam bete. Mikel luue can he þam scau, Wit moyses he sent þam lau, And liuerd þam o mikel wa, For þai had mani felun faa. And heled þar bath dumb and def, And did þe wand bere flur and lef, þat aaron him-self bar, Als i haf teld yow forwit ar. And openli þaim forwit hete, Thoru þe muth o sere prophete, þat he suld flexs take o þair kin, For to ranscun wit adam sin. And quen þai asked saul to king, He gaf þaim freli þair asking. And siþen king dauid thoro chesing, þat slogh golias wit his sling; And efter him king salamon; And þe land of his promission Hight he þam in to won. And þar a-pon he sent his sun In erth be born, þe soth to tell, To ranscun all þat yode to hell; And troud noght yeit þaa felun þat þam tald rightwis sy[m]eon, Of him þat he in handes bare, Bot euer mistrud mar and mar, Quen he him-self emang þam kidd, And mani fair meracles did; Als was be-for þe architricline, Quen he þe water turnd in-to wine: And o ten men þat war mesell, þat he gaf til ilkan þair hele; O lazar þat ded was alsua, þat he raisid, and oþer maa; And of a man þat was vnfere Mar forsoth þan thritti yere; And als of oþer mani sere, þe teind i mai not recken here.

Bot þou sal couer and comforth þam þat þou sees in þair site, And þe and þin, bath of yur care, i sal yow mak all quite.” Alle þe apostels þan bi-gan to fal a-pon a gret; And þan he went als he was wont vn-to mont oliuete, Thre disciplis wit him yede foluand at his fete. “Bides here, and prai,” he said, “i sal cum to yow skete.” Fra þaim he yode þan allan a stancast wel o strete. Wit him he thre apostels toke, ar he mad his praier, Petre, Iams, and sant Ion, þer thre him derrest wer. Priueli þam ledd him wit for-qui þai war him dere, And sceud þam a-pon þe mont, his consail for to here. Als dos þe fader to þe sun, he can þam teche and lere, And of angus in his hert til þam al mad he clere. “Mi saul es sorful to þe ded þat i sal suffer son, To-quils i ga mi praier mak ye bide me here on hone.” A stancast þan fra þaim he yode, and þar he made his bone, Til his fader der of heuen þat sittand es in trone. Of his soru mai naman tell þat liues vnder þe mone, For-þi godmen, i warnis yow to thinc al of his care, And folus him yur fader es to leten on his lare; Awai yee do yur pride o lijf þat yee wit mikel fare, And buxu[m]nes for him yee bere, þat baret for yow bare; For his wa agh yee all to wepe, þat sufferd for us sare, Of all þe sorus þat has ben, suilk herd yee neuer ar. To-quils he lai in orisun, he wit his fader grett, For þe mikel drednes o ded, his hali flesche al suett; þat was blod þan of him ran, þe place was þar-wit wett, Strang it was, þat soru, i-wiss, þat in his hert was sett. “Fader,” he said, “þou her þi sun þat nu to þe wil cri, Quer i sal þis calice drinc, or i sal pass þar-bi? Fader,” he said, “þou wat it wel, sai it noght-for-þi, All þi wil it sal be dun, þar-til i am redi.” Lauerdinges nu, for godds luue, yee herken to mi spell, O suilk a soru so i said ar man herd neuer tell. Wit strang dred he smiton was, Thoru his flesche and fell, Quen suete o blod vte of him brast, þat sua on erth fell. Quen he was risen vt o þis sture, til his felaus come he, All on-slepe he fand þam fast for soru and for pite. Ful mildli to þam he spak, “breþer, quat nu do yee? Rises vp, and wakes wel, Ar yee tempted be. Petre, wak wit me a quile, þus hight þou not to me?” þair eien war greued sua wit grete, þat soru was to se, “Rise vp peris, has þou nu al forgeten þat þou hight? þou said for me if mister war, to ded thole suld þou fight; And nu þou mai noght wak wit me An hore of a night. Bes wakand ai in orisun for him, þe maledight, þof þe spreit ai redi be þe flesche be ful to plight.” Quen he ha þus-gat þam bi-taght, stil he left þam þare, And went him eft vnto þe sted quar he was praiand are. Mikel he dred þat hard ded, þat broght vs vte o care. Ful buxumli he laid him don apon þat erth bare, And til his suete fader of heuen, þan quainid he his sare, Wit wordes þat he forwit said, and noþer less na mar. “I wat wel þat i sal it drinc þis calice, fader mine, Thoru mi bodi most it pass þe tholing o þis pine. I am þi sun, al redi bun, will to do al þin.” Wit þis he ras vp o þe place, þat he honurd him in; Quen he had mad his orisun, vp þeþen he ras ewai, He com til his apostels son slepand þar þai lai. To wacken þam ne wald he noght, þai teind war wit trai. O þam redles him reud sare, mare þan man can sai. And þan he went þe thrid sith, his fader for to prai. Quen he had þe thrid sith made his orisun, And mening til his fader der made of his passiun, þe strang soru þat he ledd can na man rede in run; þe angel vte of heuen come, On slepe þai lai alle dun. “Slepes nu, for wel yee mai, mi breþer leif,” he said, “For he es cummand negh at hand þe tresun has puruaid, For mi god ded he sal me giue A waful hard braid, Bot mikel wa if he wald wijt þer es him for-wit laid, And pine lastand wit-vten end in hell es for him graid. He has wroght, if he wald wijt, him-seluen mikel wa. Wit mikel folk nu cumand es he þat es mi fa, Sper and suerd and mace þai bring, And wapens oþer maa; Iudas yonder cums nu lo, þat sekes me to sla.” Ful merred war þai in þair mode, ful merck it was þe night; Als þai on ferr þam lok fra, þai sagh cumand a light. His disciplis wex ful radd quen þai sagh þat sight, A lantern, staf, and suerd, and sper, and mani brandes bright, And Iudas armed to þe fote, al redi for to fight, On him he suld ha foghten fore, Wit resun and wit right, Iesus went him forþerward, disciplis him foluand, Vn-tilward a littel yard O cedron ouer þe strand. Iudas wel he kneu þe stede quar iesus was hauntand, Wit his fals felauscip þe traitur þar him fand. Quen Iudas had auised him quilk it was iesu, Son he ran him for to kis, And grett him, herkes hu. “Hali maister,” he said, “þou be!” “Iudas, quat sekes þou?” “Iesus,” he said, “o na?areth.” “yee haf him funden nu, I am he;” quen he sua had said al to þam þan, Iudas and his felauscip All on bak þai ran. þai fell þaim don vn-to þe grund, þar euer-ilk man, Iudas on ilk lim he quok, all vp þai siþen wan. Yeitt asked iesus “quat þai soght?” þai said, “iesum sek we,” “And als i forwit haf yow said, here haf yee funden me.” Iudas eft he lepe him to, “Aue rabi,” coth he, For to kiss his suet muth he bedd it him ful fre. “Sin yee me seke, i yow biseke yee lat mi felaus be, Iudas,” he said, “þat þou sal do, þar-to nu hij þou þe.” Quen Iudas him bedd to kiss, Iesus it groched noght, “Iudas, quilum was,” he said, “þat mikel o þe i roght, Nu þou has wit felunni and tresun me bisoght, Wit a coss has þou mans sun vn-to þi bandun broght.” Wit þis word þat iesus said, þai stert þam forth ilkan, þai him vn-sett on ilk side þat son þar was he tan. Wit maces and wit neues smert vn-rekenli on him ran, Ilk dint þat þai him gaf, it reked to þe ban. Petre þan him luued sa wel, he sagh na better wan, O þe forel a suerd he drogh þe ere he smat of an, For had it ben efter his wil he wald him fain ha slan. Iesus þan said, “petre, do wai! dint ne giue þou nan, In þe forel þou pute þi suerd, I wil noght þat þou smete.” On malcus ere his hand he laid, And heild it ful tite; “He þat smitand es wit suerd, o suerd sal ha þe wite, I wil þat nan for mi sak noþer fight ne flite. Peter freind, i sai to þe, quer þou it has for-gett, If i mi fader wald be-seke, I moght wit-vten lett Haf tuelue thusand legions redi all vmsett. Bot hu suld þan þe prophecies til end cum, þat er sett?” Petre was in hand nummen for forfait he had don. Iesus tok þis malcus ere, And heild it wit-vten hon, “Ga forthe,” [he] said, “mi fader has Wroght for þe mi bon.” Petre wald a-wai ha bene And þan he scaped son, Quen his lauerd a-wai was ledd Wit him war leift ful fon. Bi his heued and bi his hare for þai his maister drogh, And rugged him vn-rekenli bath ouer hill and ogh; Wit þair bastons bete þai him, and did him mikel wogh Hu þai him ledd þat ilk time to se was soru i-nogh. Nu wit bastons þai him beft Ful grimli to þe grund, þai huited on him viliker þan he had ben a hund. His disciplis þat wer feird at fle bigan to fund, And als þai fra þe herth him tite, His bodi was al stund. Quils þai war þus him handland Wilik als þai mogh[t], “Ha, quat yee godmen nu er man vnseli thoght; Wit staues qui bete yee me sua, quat haf i gain yow wroght? Quar-for haf yee taken me, And als a theif vm-soght Wit lantern a-pon nightertale And i ne fled yow noght? Forsoth i neuer serued it, in dede ne yeitt in sau, In þe temple was i wont to teche þam ilk dau, þar all þe folk was won to cum Wit maisters o þe lau.

For yee me hate al to þe ded Haf yee nan oþer might, Bot suilk it es yur time,” he said, “mirckenes wit-vten light. Ful il-hail þan troud yee Iudas, þat maledight, Mikel pine puruaid es yuu, bot mar til him es hight.” His hend þai band and ledd him forth, a-trott and noght þe pas, Vntil þair aun biscop hus, Was hatten caiphas. Mate and weri war þai þan, þai ne wist quar-for it was, Left þai noght bi-hind þam þan þe fals felun Iudas, þar he liuerd his maister vp þai bunden had wit la?as, þe feluns logh him til hething on ilk side, allas! Petre he folud him on ferr, For durst he noght in sight, For wonder gladli wald he wite o þe ending if he might. To caiphas hus son he com, And þider in he tight, Nu i hope it halden bes þat crist him forwit hight, He drogh him bak be him þe men Wald he noght cum in light. Quen he was to þe palais cummen, Sperd it was þe yate, A knaun freind he had þare-in, in he did him late Priueli for in his mode, For was he neuer sa mate, Gladli wald he spek and sper Bot at quam he ne wate; Quat thing suld of his maister worth, Wijt wald he ful fain. A quil forward he yode, a quile him drogh a-gain, Quat þai thoght wit his maister do gladlie wald he frain. For sare he dred þat siþen fell o þaim he suld be slain. A fir was kindeld on þe place, þe night it was ful caald, Mani drou a-bote þat fire For tiþans þat war tald. Petre þidder-ward him drogh, þof he was vn-baald, A sargant þar was war of him, and can him to be-hald. Quen þis man had auised him, And þar he sagh him stand, “yon,” he said, “es an of his þat wit vs es in hand.” “Ful eber thuert nai,” coth he, “yee mis nu vnderstand, Ne wist i neuer quat he was sin i was born in land.” Had noght petre bot a-wai vnnethes þeþen gan, Quen a-noþer wit him mete And said, “þis ilk es an Of his felauscep for-soth, yee do þat he be tan.” Coth petre, “knaulage of him had i neuer nan,” Wit þis he drou him nere þe ?ate, Fain wald ha ben þer-vte, Bot þar he mett a woman son þat did him mast to dute. Him þis sco said, “for-soth i sagh lang ar wit him in rute, þou sais noght soth ‘i knau him noght ne neuer was þar a-bute.’” “I knau him noght, for-soth,” he said, þar-til his ath he suer;— Be þis was þe time o night past midnight and mare. þan bigan þe cok to crau, þe time was cummen þar, Petre þan him bi-thoght, þe word him said was are, And went him forth vte of þat curt, Wepand full selli sare. Iesus þan turnd him a-bute, on petre his hei he kest, þan wijst he cummen his maister word Wit-vten langar frest. Quen he him-self it vnderstod, Almast his hert can brest. þat night he did him to a roche, þar-vnder for to rest, For he ne wijt quider-ward to weind, ne quat þat him war best. It es writen o sir Iudas quen he had don þat sin, Wit his penis þat he tok, Went til his moder in. “Moder, i haf mi maister sald, sal he naman bigin, And in mi purs þe pris i bere, sumquat þan get i win.” Iudas was iesu aumnere, bath theif and traitur bald, All þat him was bitaght Ful selden gain he yald. Of his thift and his felunni, His moder al he tald, And hu he to þe Iuus had His aun maister sald. “Nu has þou þi maister sald?” “moder,” said he, “ya.” “þou,” sco said, “nu sal be scent, i wat þai mon him sla, To ded þou sal him se be don, bot he sal rise þar fra.” “Rise,” said he, “dame nai, god dote, bes it noght moder sua, Ne sal he neuer vp-rise eft, truli i þe hight, Ar sal þis cok vp-rise was skald yisternight!” Vnnethe had he said þe word, þe cok lepe vp and flight Federd faryer þan be-forn and cru thoru grace o dright; And þan bigan þe traitur fals to dred him of his plight. þis it was þat ilk cok, þat petre herd him crau, Quen he had nite his lauerd thris he did him-seluen knau. Spek we nu hu þai iesus ledd, þis folk wit-vten au, Bath hidir and þider, bot þai ne wist quider þai wald him drau; þe lath despit þat þai him did, es soru i-wiss to scau. Al þat night he was in hand a-mang þat cursed lede, Apon þe morn ran þider-ward þe folk, als þai wald wede. þe lauerdinges al war efter sent to be bifore þis dede. Peter, quen he sagh þe dai, til his felaus he yede He went him for to wisit þaim, for þar-of had þai nede, A sorful[er] night moght naman haf, þan he had, als we rede. [The Trial before Caiaphas and Pilate.] In sir caiphas curt þai heild þan þair gadiring, Again þair lege lauerd, i-wiss, to hefd him or to hing. All þai gadird o þe tun, bath freman and dring, And sent to pilate þair procuratur, And did him þider bring, For he sett vte-ouer þam vnder cesar þe king. Sir pilate com and asked þam, in hething als it war, “Quar es your king, yee do him bring forth bifor vs here.” þai stert þam forth vnsterli, Wit a fulbald bere, “Parfai, pilate, wel þou aght to hald him ful vn-dere, þat king him mas wit-vten leue Ouer cesar þe emperour, Herd þou neuer na selcut slike Als þou of him sal here.” Caiphas þair biscop was Ful riche man and rank All þai gedird at his curt, and þai samen sanck. iesus þat in prisun lai, ful herd þai did hanc, And bonden broght him forth as thef, þair will him was ful vlanck. þai vmbithoght þaim on quat wise þat þai moght him wrei, And wit quat thing þai titest moght do him for to dei. Sir pilate o þaim bi-heild, o skil was sumdel slei, þat kneu sumdel þair feluni, Wist þam was leif to lei; He beheilde þat bitter bald, Hu þai said þair resun, And vnderstode þat þai him had tene al wit tresun. He luued nawight þat wick folk, for þai war ai felun. Pilat satt, and him a-butte þe burges o þe tun; Bifor þam iesus stode als a lambe, His hefd druppand dun, On þam he loked noght his ei. to lei þai war ai bun, Mani lesing had þai loun again iesu þat dai; Pilat did men here and list Al thing þat þai wald sai. Bot he cuth find na skil quar-for On him men witte suld lai, For in þair aun sagh þai said, oft-sith for-kid þai. Vp þar stert tua panteners in middes þat consile, And said on hei to sir pilate, “sir, herken vs a quile. He þis es man, and mas him godd, to ger men trou his gile, He es na godd ne godd suns, of him we knau þe stile.” “Godmen,” he said, “yeitt es þar mar?” “Herkens we sal yow tell, þat he in þe temple said quar we herd him spell. He bad þat we þe temple suld al to þe grund dun fell, He suld it rais þe thrid dai, na langer terme emell.” Wit þis sir pilate sun vp-rais, Iesum he wit him ledd, And yode in-to þe pretori, þat was a sundri stede. Bituix þam tua he asked him quar-for he was sa medd To þat folk him soght wit scam þat answar nan he bedd? “Seis þou noght, þat þai þe hate þir Iuus, nathing mare, If þai ha might wit wild ded þai will þe for-fare. Ne heres þou noght on ilk-a side hu þai apon þe rar, Again þair saues þat þai sai, quin giues þou þaim answar? Sin man has said vs þat þou ert A wis man o lare; Sai me iesus, qui dos þou þus? to me na soth þou spare.” At þir wordes come a man rinnand fast in hij, And said þat he wald spek onan wit pilate priueli. A messager him tiþand broght Fra his wijf, his leuedi, Sco grett him wel and tiþand sent þe quilk he had redi. “Mi wijf es sumquat iuel at ess, And þat es for a sight þat sco wit-in hir sleping sau, nu þis ilk night, O iesu, þat þis fals folk Has tan wit-vten plight. Word sco sendes þe for-þi, if ani wai þou might þat þou thole him noght to dei, for it war gret vn-right.” Quen pilate had þis tiþand herd, And wel it vnderstode, He broght þam iesum þan agayn, And to þe curt he yode. “God men,” he said, “yee can noght find oght in þis man bot gode, For he es noght worthi to dei, Als me think in mi mode. Bot skurges him and late him ga, quen yee mai see þe blod.” “Do wai,” coth þai, “nu sir pilate, quare-for sais þou sua, We wil it graunt on nankin wise þat he suld scap vs fra. He mas him king, and wald be cald, And þou wat wel þat qua Mas him king wit-vten leue, es þe imperours fa. O galilee þan es he born þe folk he dos mis-ga.” Quen þat pilat herd þam sai he was o galilee, Thoght he wald ha sauued him, to dred þan can he, For herod was þat ilk siquar keper o þat contre. Iesus bunden als he was, alsua he lete him be, And wit his sergant he him sent til herod for to se. For to wreth yeit herod mar pilat thoght ful lath, For he and he had samen ben, forwit selcuth wrath, For to do his breth to bu, of him þat was ful brath. [To herowde þo he hym sent euyn the hie gate;] Herod had yernd him to se, and of his come was fain, Wit his knightes vp he ras, and went him þan again. Of him he wend ha signes sene, For noght, al was in vain, Ne wald he neuer on him bi-hald, for thing þat he moght frain. Bot yeit þe Iuus fined noght, to seke iesum wit wrake, þai praid herod þat he ne suld na praier for him make, Ne help him, ne he ne did, Al for þe Iuus sake. Yeit I hope þat þai sal bath grisly bi-for him quake. Quils þat herod wit him spak, And he answerd him noght, For he had gernd him to se þar-for him for-thoght, For had he þan anlepi signe forwit herods wroght, Had noght þe Iuus don him to ded for thing þai cuth or moght. He asked him al priueli, qui þai him sua bi-soght, “Speke wit me, and sai me qui and al sal be for noght.” And iesus held him stil als he noght of him-seluen had roght: A purprin clath þai on him kest, And gain to pilate broght In taken þat he was a fole, þat his wijt littel doght. Apon þan sir herods halue þai gret wel sir pilate, And said, “sir, yee er freindes made, þe soth þar-for yee wate, He has þe sent þis man again right in þat ilk state. A word wit him ne wald he spek, ne ans vp lift his late. He es þe selcuthest man, þat euer yeit we sei, For he will noiþer change his cher for lau man ne for hei, Noþer ansuar for to giue, ne lift vp ans his hei. Bot herod thankes þe þi sand, for-soth we sal noght lei.” “Godote,” said pilate to þam þan, “þat thine me ful gode, Bot gines me consail if yee can, for menged es mi mode. þis godman es o mikel wijt, qua-sa it vnder-stode, Bot he has wrethed yow, for-qui yee er wit him sa wod.

Godmen quat es þan your dome sais me certanli,” Alle þai said, “þat he be don on rode, and þat in hi.” “Better mote yee sai þan sua,” coth pilate, “sua rede i, To varn yur consail better it es þan to do mar foli.” Pilate þan was ful wrath, i-wiss, wit þaim þat ilk dai, “Man,” he said, “qui dos þou sua, qui wil þou nathing sai Agains þam þat folus þe, noiþer ya ne nai? For þi stat þou aght to spek, to bring þi self a-wai, And help þe nu als ar has dun, for wel þou can and mai. Qui es þe nu sa lath to spek? for-ansuer þam, i rede, Ne seis þou noght hu þat þis folk þe beres to þe dede? A freind has þou noght bituix þam, for all er þai þi fede, If þou wil noght help þi-self, men haldes þe for quede. Sai me son quer þat þou be godd sun or nan, þat i mai wijt it witerli.” þan ansuerd he o-nan, “I am his sun als þou has said þat all leis be wan; þat sal be sene quen sothfastnes sal quilum be ouer-tan, Tru it qua-sum wil it tru, i sal yow scau þe right, For to climbe þe cludes all þe sunn sal haf þe might. And for his freindes efterward dun þan sal he light, Noght als in priueti i sai, bot in yur aller sight.” Ful wel at þis word was he herd wit þat cursd lede, And vp þai ras and gaf a cri, Als þof þai wald wede. “Quat mister es o wijtnessing again him for to lede? His aun muth nu has him dempt, o wijtnes es na nede. Dos him on rode, þat ranscun non sa bald befor him bede.” Wit þis a sergarnt forth þar stert, þat stode a-mang þam þar, He lift his hand and a buffet He gaf iesu ful sare; Eftersons said he, “spek bot scil and wordes suilk na mare, For þi mi[s]-sau þat all has herd maldathait qua þe spare, And quils þou liues here wit vs þi lengring sal be care.” He lift þan vp his face And loked on þat felun, “Freind,” he said, “qui smites þou me wit-vten right resun, Ar þat þou mi word had mend, quat es þin a-chesun? þe man es noght ouertan in mote at smit him es tresun.” Pilate him ras, and forth yode vte o þe pretori, þis felun folk iesu þai ledd, foluand him wit cri. Pilate said and badd þai ne suld do him na vilani, For quat ending þe mote suld take, þai wist noght witerli. In-til a chamber went pilat þan priueli him an, And iesus thoru his commandment, þar-in wit him es gan. Pilate þan him to resun did wit wordes manian, “Goddman,” said he, “sai me nu qui þou ert als prisun tan, Thoruut þis biscop and his men þat þou ert to be taght? Wel knaus þou þaim, and þai þe þat þe in hand has laght. Ert þou goddsun,” he said, “es o sua mikel maght?” “Soth,” he said, “qui askes þou, it es þe forthwit taght.” “þe soth þou sai me,” coth pilate, “quar-for þai er þi fa, I wat and seis þai wel noght fine, be-tuixand þai þe sla. Ne wat þou þat þe pouste es min to spill or latte ga?” þan said iesus to sir pilate, “me thinc it es noght sua, For þof þou pouste haf a quil, þou sal noght haf it ai. I haf it o godd and es his sun if i þe soth sal sai.” Pilate seis þat wit na word ouercum him he mai, Of his clothes vn-clethes him, And oþer on him did lai. Sua he sent him cled a-gain to þaim þat was his fas, Apon his heued a cron þai sett, In hething al, allas! Iesus thoght ful mikel scam quen he sua scruded was, For cuth he neuer wit suilk be cledd, for-wit in nankin cas. Iesus thoght ful mikel scam, and luted dun his cher, “He,” þis þai said, “es yur king, lo! him befor yow here.” Lude bigan þai for to cri þat moght ouer-here, “Gas nu forth tas him biliue, we wald on rode he were.” All þai cried, als wit a muth, “nail him on rode tre!” “Sais noght sua,” coth sir pilate, “þat es noght þe rede o me, He aght noght dei for na resun þat i can in him se.” þai said ilkan, “þis ilk man bot if he dampned be, þe frenscip sal þou lese for-soth bi-tuix cesar and þe.” Pilat said, “los, her yur king! bot herk i sal yow sai, To-moru it es your mikel fest þat yee halu in your lai, A prisun ar yee wont at hafe, for resun o þe dai. Ask quilk sum yee will haue, yee sal it haue parfai, Ask þan your king, and i yow sal noght nick wit nai.” “Quar-for,” coth þai, “qui said þou sua? leif maister, do þou a-wai! O þis iesu spek þou namar, bot of a-noþer man, þe quilk nu we haf til us taken, his name is baraban.” “O yur king þat es in hand, quat aghtel yee do þan?” “Do him on tre;” “sacles es he sa feir se sum i can.” Efter þis word ai mar and mar to cri all þai be-gan. “Selcuth vs thinc o þe, pilate wit drightin for to drill, We haf us chosen nu baraban, him haf algat we will.” Pilate he thoght þair ?erning al þat he it wald fulfill, Quen he sagh þat al his soigne þai tok it al to ill, Iesus þat al to-draun was to scruge he taght þam til. Quen þat pilate sagh na bote gain þaim langer to striue, O iesu dede he thoght þe saght al fra him-seluen driue, Vp he ras midward þe folk and wess his hend bi-liue. “All yee se,” he said, “þat i es saccles of his liue.” þai cried all on hei, “pilate bi still, thar þe noght dred, His blod on us be, and on þaim þat of vs sal brede.” And sua it es, la god it wijt, sene on al þair sede, For nu þan er þai thralles made vnder al oþer lede. Pilate stode vp on his fete mid-ward þat gret gadring, “Pes,” he said, “lo, here to yow es liuerd vp yur king. And i here yow sai þat yee him will do on rode to hing.” “Do wai pilate, til vs,” coth þai, “feires noght do sli thing, He haf vr lagh,” coth þai, “þat we liue wit al in land, Efter þe lagh þan sal he dei, þis sal þou vnderstand.” Pilate forthoght þaim bath to wrath, bot wald þam hald in hand, To þaa wilful wod he taght þe lauerd es al-weldand. þan was þat suet sacles fless don to mikel wrang, First þai band him til a tre and scurges him suang Fra þe hefd vnto þe fote, Oueral þe blod vte-wrang. Siþen þai crond him wit thorn, þat thoru his hefd thrang, And bitaght ham at þair will, þair sergantz for to hang. þe man-slaer, he barabas, es laisd o prisun, And vr lauerd es ledd to sla wit-vten ani chesun. For vte o prisun ha þai don þe thef and þe felun, And on þe rod þai ga to hing þe lauerd and þe barun; þai and alle þe sede of him has godds malesun.

Iudas stode amang þe folk, for to be-hald and se Hu vile þat þai wit him delt, and quat scham he can drei Quen þat he saght þar was na soigne þat his lauerd ne suld dei, þan him reued of his res, and went him-self wrei. Quen þat he sagh his maister sua be-casten al to care, Wit his penis forth he lepe he had resaueid are; þan him reud his marchandis, allas! caitiue ful sare. “Quat yee er,” he said, “a felun folk! for yee can naman spar, Here i yeld yow yur mone, ges me a-gain mi war. Ful wrather-hail to min bihoue haf i tan þis mone, For þe sacles blod of him, for rightwis man es he.

To be don in þair corbanan, þai said þat it noght doght, Acheldemach þai cald þis feld, for it wit blod was boght, For to delue in vncuth men þat to þe cite soght. Ihesus crist, vr sauueur, es demed be dun on dau, For to be hanged on a tre, Als þan was theues lau. For suilk a tre þam wanted all als written es in sau; þai said þai wald þe kinges tre vnto þat mister sau, For it was comun þai it suld vte o þe temple drau. þai went þaim to þe temple suith, in tua þis tre þai scare, Als mikel als þai sagh to þaim, gainand an mani mar. þai fand it als neu and fress als it on stouen ware. Al quat þai wald þar-of to scap, fand þai na letting þare, Wit-vten rott, wit-vten brest, it smeld selcut suete, For to mak þis werk þer-of, wit-vten letting it lete.

Tua hundreth men sent caiphas to fote a-wai þat tre, þai most oþer heu it þare or for to lat it be. þe rode þai scop þan as þai wald, als we þe taken se, O cedre, cipres, and o pine, Als writen es on þat tre. Apon þe hefd o þis rode, ouer-thwart was don a brede, þar war þe letters written in o mani man war redd. Quen it was wroght þai moght all it ster vte o þe sted, Til ur lauerd iesus crist was þar-to self ledd. Quen he come to þat suete tre til him þaa feluns said, “Tak it up,” coth þai, “þou seis hu it es to þe graid.” He luted dun and kist it sun, and at þe first braid, Wit-vten ani help o man apon his bak it laid.

Half feirth of eln was þe length, And oþer half þe brede, And þan to mont o caluari all þar-wit þai yede. Apon þe mont of caluarie þai sett þis rode tre, Mani man folud o þe tun, and mani o þe contre, þat sum for god and sum for ill, him come all for to se; Mani þar grett and mani logh, o þat grett assemble. þe riche men bi-scornd him, and did al þat þai moght Hu þai moght do him most despite, on ilk side þai soght.

Grett it was þat folk to see, þat gadred to þat thrang, Yong and ald, man and wijf, þai weped and handes wrang. “Yee foles mistruand folk,” þai said, “qui will yee algat hang þe man þat neuer plight has don? mikel ha yee don wrang.” Als þai quained iesu þus, wimmen o þat cite, Iesus turnd him abute and þus to þaim said he; “Wimmen, wimmen, dos a-wai! wepe yee noght for me, Bot on yur childer and on yow-self, for yeit þe dai sal be þe baraigne blisced sal man call; for soth þis sal men se. Blisced sal men hald þair wamb þat neuer barnes bare, þe papp þat neuer suken was, for in þat time o care þe felles sal þai bidd on þam fall, sua hidd wald þai þai ware.

Mony grete clerkez þat were Far in other land, Seghen þe son fare soo And koud not vnderstand, For of our lord no?t þai knew, Bot thoru clergy þai soght, þat wikked men here on erth Godis son to ded hade broght; And vnderstode of mans kynd þat he hade flesche &amp; bone.

He saide þat god tholed Ded in mannes kynd, Or vn-kyndly þe werld is tourned, þes word was lang in mynd. About þe neghent oure of þe day, Our lord loude gon cry, And saide, “Eloy Eloy, lamazabatani,” þat was to say “my god, my god, Whi has þou forsaken me;” For þe grete thraws of ded, These ilk wordez said he. þe Iews when þai herd þis, þai saide, “he calles hely, Lett vus se whether heli com To liuer him in hy.” Softly spake our lord þen, For ded was ne?e comand, “Fader,” he saide, “I here betake My saul into þi hand.” Right os he saide þat word To-geder fell his eghen, And boghed doun his heued, þe gast þen was geen.

Bot if þou quake for care, Grete doyl of þe it is. Al creatures for his ded made doil &amp; pite, And þou þat he deed fore cannot sorus be. A prophet spekez of our lord os we fynd it writen A word of grete doyl, os þese clerkez witen, þe fox has his den and ilk foghel is nest, And man son has nothing apon his hed to rest; For til our lord in erth so mikel was not leued, Whar on þat he mi?t rest on is wery heued.

For-þi þai bar þe malescun of him þat þaron bled. Nu is þe croice grauen vnder greit, and iesus vnder stan, And hinges all hope of hali kirc in maria mild allan. Ai til iesus þe thrid dai had fughten gain sathan, And werid him on his aun bit, als hund es on a ban, And als þe fisch right wit þe bait apon þe hok es tan, For þof he sagh him man als man, his godd-hed sagh he nan. To quils his flesche lai vnder greit, his gast til hell es gan, þat wit þe might of his godd-hed, he ras him-self o-nan. Thoru a tre, sum yee haf herd, was al mankind mad thrall, And thoru þis hali rode tre, þan war we frehed all. Again þat apell adam ete was gin iesu þe gall, Alle þe pines o þis werld to tell þai war ful small, Ogains leist of his to drei, if i ne lei yow sall; For he þat neuer sin did, vr sinnes all he bar, And vili for us was ledd, als i haf tald yow ar. For ur sakes þat we haf don he sufferd al þe sar, Noght o lime of his licam he sufferd noght to spar; And siþen his lijf for us he gaf, quat moght he þan do mar.

[OF THE RESURRECTION.] On sono?day in þe daghyng, he ros fro ded to liue, When þe knightes sleped fast with him þai might not striue. When he ros þe erthe con quake, þen hade þe Iews doute, And ded men ros of þer graues and ?ode walkand aboute. In witnes þai ros with him, and honoured his rising, For þe Iews suld not with-say þat gart to ded him bring. Our lord opend not his throgh when he ros at morne, No more he did his moder wombe when þat he was borne. Al hole he left his graf when he went þer froo, Als he did his modir womb, when he was born als-soo. Wele wist our lord by-fore all þat was to doyn, For he ordend his ded be cours of son &amp; moyne; In þe hegh ful he deed, &amp; þat it friday were, þe aungel grette our leuedy, þe same time of þe ?ere. þat ilk day seuennight bi-fore, þat same day it is, þat oure louerd made both heuen &amp; erth I wis. þe sext day afterward he made man als-soo, þe seuent day toke he rest, on þe aghtand come our woo. For on þat day adam ete þe appel of þe tre, Ful litel while it was þat he in ioy wald bee. Sithen lang afterward, fif thowsand ?ere &amp; moo, Our lord ?oght to tak mankynd and bring vus oute of woo. þe same day þat adam did þe syn agayns þe right, þat ilk day os it felle, godisson in marie light. ?it lange bi-fore bad our lord to moyses in old daghe, Apon þe Mount of sinay, þer he gaf him þe laghe, þat men schold ilk ?ere þat time þer sacrifise þore doyne, Of a lamb þat were clene at heghe ful of þe moyne. þis bitokend þat he wald for vus marterd bee, þat time when þe moyn wor ful, and by vus on þe tree. For þus þen bode it nede be be þis skil þat I say, In þe heghe fulle of þe moyne and als on a friday. And on our laidy day als-soo, þe syn was first wroght, For-þi þat day bi reson bode man agayn be boght. þese thre thinges a-bod our lord, or he to ded wald goo, Vre leuedy day &amp; friday als and ful moyne als-soo. þat friday was our leuedy day on wilk our lord slayn was, And þe moyne at heghe ful þat day os god gaf gras; Bot now ful selden fallez it soo, for-þi vse we ay After heghe ful of þe moyne to take þe next friday, And þat hald we our gode friday; þe thrid day after soyne, Hald we hely pasche day, and so haue all men doyne. Ilk cristen man at þat day take his flesch &amp; his blode, þat he gaf to strang ded for vus apon þe rode. Mary maudlayn &amp; mari Iacobe, þat was our leuedi sister, And marie salome, Hade boght þam oynemenz for oure lord ennoyntynge, And went to þe sepulcre on sononday in þe daghynge, Toward his graf þai went, þese thre, makand þer mone, And saide, “who sal vus helpe to remou þat heuy stone?” When þat our lord vp-rose þe erthe quoke &amp; made sown, Our lordez aungel fro heuen to þe graf þen light doun. Of his sepulcre þore he put away þe stone, And þer-apon him sett, faire &amp; bri?t he shone. His lokyng was als bri?t os is þe rede lempninge, And als white oos snaw was alle his clethinge. þe knightez wore so ferd þat kepped him in þat sted, þat þai lay ful lang right os þai hade bene ded; For brightnes of þis aungel sore þai were adredd. þe clothez þat iesus was wonden in aboute þai sa?e hom spredd, And when þai missed his body fast away þai fledd, And told vnto þer maisters how þat þai hade spedd. þese thre maries come þiderward, for drede þai stynted oft For ferd of þe Iews, and sithen welk ful soft. When þai be-hild þiderward with ful drery mone, þai sa?e þe lidd ouertorned þat was a ful grete stone. In was in maner of a hows þat crist laide in was, Grauen depe in a roche, a wonder mikel plas; þer was our lord sepulcre, in þe northside I-wis, So heghe be thre spane no nother graf þer is. When þese wymmen come til his monument þore, þai sa?e an aungel sit, a ?ong child os it wore, Cled in white clething. þen hade þai drede in thoght, þis aungel saide to þam, “wymmen dred yow noght, ?e seke iesu of nazarethe þat doyn was on þe tre, He is risen &amp; not here, be-hald þe stede &amp; see! To petre &amp; his deciples hastile tell ?ee, þat he is risen fro ded and gon to galile, On-lif in flesch &amp; felle, os he told ?ow by-fore. Highes vnto þat plas, for ?e sal fynd hym þore.” For he neuend peter by name, a skill I tel yow qwy, For he for-soke our lord, he come not in company Amang þe apostels for schame, for-þi his name neuend hee, þen þai sold not him blame þen he in wanhope bee. And qui he for-soke our lord more þen hese falas? It was our lordez ordinans, for-þi no wonder has, He ordend him hede of heli kirk, þof alle he him for-soke, To haf mercy of synful men ensaumple at him he toke. þus was marie maudlayn erly forthe went, Ho ran to peter &amp; to Iohne, and told hou þe aungel hir sent. “þai haf taken my lord,” scho saide, “and out of graf him broght.” þof alle þe aungel hir told ful siker was scho noght. Peter &amp; Iohne to-geder ran to wit how it were, Bot Iohne was þe swifter, and þe ere come þere, And loked in &amp; sa?e þe schetez, bot he dorst not gang in. Peter come after &amp; in he went or euer he wald blyn, And sa?e þe schetez spred, and þe sudary þore leued þat was in þe sepulcre laide on our lordez heued. þe went in Iohne þat first com to þe monument, And sa?e &amp; trawed wele þat he away wore hent. þai couthe not vnderstand, ne were not ?it so wise, To traw þat him bode nede fro ded to lyue rise. þen went þai home agayn þore where þai come froo, And wend he hade bene born away, bot maudlayn wald not soo. Marie wald not away til þat scho wist more, With-oute þe monument scho stode, and grette wonder sore. Als scho stouped doune, and loked farre &amp; neghe, Within þe monument two aungels scho seghe Cled in white clothez sitand in þat stede, þat one at þe fote of þe graf, þat other at the hede. þe aungels saide, “womman whi gretez þou so sore?” “For þai haf taken my lord,” scho seide, “and doyne him Ine wote whore.” With þat word scho tourned hir and sa?e our lord stand nere, Scho wend not it had bene he, bot a gardiner. “Whi gretez þou, womman?” quod our lord, Maudlayn said ful soyne, “For þai haf taken my lord, I ne wote whore he is doyne. Sir,” scho saide, “if þou him haf auther tane away, Tell me whore he is þat I him take may.” “A! mary,” saide our lord, and scho tourned hir in hy, And felle vnto his fete, and saide “raboni,” (þat is on englis maister) and wald nede neghe him neghe. “Neghe me not,” he saide, “yhit steghe I not on heghe To my fader in heuen; bot to my brether þou goo, And say, I to my fader wend, þaire god &amp; myn als-so.” Til his deciples maudlayn com, and told þam alle bi-dene þat scho of our lord hade bothe herd &amp; sene. þis was þe first time þat iesus, heuen kynge, Schewed til anyman after his vp-risyng. A grete honour to wymmen did he in þat cas, Namly to þoo þat synful are, for scho synful was. Here may we see ensaumple þat wymmen mony are gode, When Iohne and Iames &amp; þai alle fro our lord ?ode, With brennand luf scho dwelled, and after him scho so?t, And til scho wist an end away wald scho noght. þis was on of þe creatures þat euer on erthe was, þat kydd most luf til our lord, als me think in this cas. Als mikel os scho loued bi-fore þe dele &amp; wricchednes, Als mikel &amp; more loued scho crist thoru hir grete godenes. Scho alle-one kid him more luf, þen alle men þat wore borne, His disiples or alle his kyn, os I ere saide be-forne,— Oute-taken his moder þat loued him tenderly By-fore alkyn creatures, and þat was no ferly. Toward desiples marie went, þe other two maries scho mett And told hom þis ti?and, for ioy alle thre þai grette. And alle to-gedir þai ?ode to telle þe apostels þis. With þese thre maries os þa went, mette our lord I-wis, “Hayl ?e bee!” he saide, als þai him gon mete. þai ran to him ful soyn, and þore þai hiled his fete, “Leues þis,” he saide, “&amp; telles fast mi brether whore þai bee, þat þai sal see me als I saide be-for þam in galile.” To his diciples ?ode þai þenne, and fond þam gretand sore, For þai wist not where iesus was, ne sa?e of him no more. þese wymmen told amang hom all of oure lord tithing, His desiples trawed hom noght, bot said it was lesynge. þen ran san peter forthe, til his graf alle his one, (?it was þis on pasche day,) and þore he made his mone. Our lord apered to him soyn, an alle in priuete, Bot whore &amp; what þai saide nauther writen fynd wee. First to peter he aperyd of his desciples alle, To gif vus ensaumple neuer in wanhope falle. Two of his disciples, als þai welk þat day To þe castel of Emaus, os it stode in þer way;— þat was fro Ierusalem os I vnderstand About seuen myle &amp; a half, halden of þat land;— Of thinges þat were doyn þai spake be-twix hom two, Iesus com him-self, &amp; with þam con he go. “What wordez are þos,” he saide, “þat ?e to-gedir talk? Ful carfully me-think be þis way ?e walk, Whi ?e are mournand? telles me þe cas.” þen answerd on of þaim, his name was cleophas, “Art þou not a pilgrim þat walkes here in land, And als fro Ierusalem me think þou art comand, And knaws not of þo wonders þat þere now late wore wroght?” “What thinges?” quod our lord, for þai ?it knew him noght. “Of iesu nazarene,” he saide, “þat was a prophete treu Both in word &amp; dede, þat god &amp; man knew; And how þe princes &amp; þe prestes, thoru þer fals rede, Gart him hang on rode and dampned him to þe ded. We wend þat he alle Israel of woo suld haf broght. And now is þis þe thrid day þat all þis was wroght, Bot wymmen flayed vus foule with wordez þat þai saide, þat were at his sepulcre, þer he in graf was layde. þai saide aungels þai sa?e, and told vus soo ilkone, And þat he was on-lif, and out of his graf gone! þen som of our felaghs went vnto þat plas, And als þe wymmen told þai fand þat it so was. Bot him-self fond þai noght, ne more of him we knaw.” “A! foyls,” quod our lord, “ful latt are ?e to traw. In alle thinkez þat þe prophetz han spoken I-wis, Crist nede be-hode suffer it for his, And soo com til his ioy.” and þus he told gode wone To þam first of moyses, and of þe prophetez ilkone, And expounded þe prophesyes thoru his hely lore, Of alle thingez þat wore writene and sayd of him by-fore. Als þai come narre þe castelle, to-geder carpand soo, Iesus made hom semblant os he wald ferrer goo. Bot þai constroyned him to dwelle, þat he no farrer might, And said, “sir, dwelle with vus, for it is nerhand night, And þe day is passed on, no farrer may þou wyn.” An þen our lord mildle with þam he went in, And with þam at þe mete he sat, euen be-twix hom twoo. He blissed þe bred &amp; after brak, and gaf it þaim als-soo, And þe[n] he fro þam went an vanisth sodanly. When þai him misse þai loked about, and saide þis word in hy, “Was not our hert brennand in hus of iesu þat was here, þat with vs spake &amp; schewed vus of him þat writen were?” þar eghen wore hid þat þai ne knew þat he was in þat stede, Als it was his aughen wille, til he brake þer brede. þen ros þai vp &amp; forth went til Ierusalem ful euene, All to-geder þai fond þore his apostels elleuene. And other moo of his diciples, and told þam openly, How þai sa?e crist &amp; with him spake, on-liue ful verraily. And he was risen fro deed, and þus said þai þore, þat crist was risen &amp; apered to peter a while be-fore. How he þam schewed þe prophesies, þai told in þat stede, And how þat þai him knew thoru brekyng of þer brede. ?it apon þe pasche day þis thing doyne it was, þat he apered to þoo twoo, luk &amp; cleophas. In-til a strang plas for drede all þe [apostels] wore goone, And alle to-geder þai whore sauf thomas of ynde allone. ?it apon þe same day he schewd to þis men?e, And stode amang hom alle, and bad “pees to ?ow bee.” þen were þai stoned ilkone, “no drede,” he saide, “has ?e, Lokes side, hand, &amp; fote, þat I þe same [be] Gropes &amp; sees oueralle, and knaw þat it be. Spirit has nauther flesch ne bone as I now haf sothtly.” ?it al þat men?e hade grete wonder in þar thoght, “Haf ?e,” quod our lord, “to þe mete di?t oght?” þai bro?t som of arosted fische, a hony combe als-soo, Be-for hom he ete þer-of, þe relef gaf him froo Til þam ilkon, &amp; saide “þese are þe wordez, I-wis, þat I haf spoken to ?ow, for prophecy it is.” And told how it writen was þat iesu crist bode nede Thole ded, &amp; rise thridday, and bring til end his dede. [Of Joseph of Arimathea.] Ioseph, wen þe Iews wist þat he hade doluen iesu crist, Wrothe with him þai wore &amp; wode, Alle for-menged in þar mode. þai send sergantz for to nym both sir nichodem &amp; him; [And oþer xij that for hym spake when they sought Iesu with wrake, Alle they hem hid to queme But forth come Sir Nicodeme] sir nichodeme sone come þan, als þer prince &amp; ouerman.

Petre was andrew broþer, þe tan was blisced and te toþer, He was born in bethaida O galilee, men clepis sua; Of hali kirc he is grund-wal, In crist him-self þat ledis alle. Formast chosun for-þi als heued, Of all þaa feres was he leued, Of godd sun first confessur, Of al man-kind herd of pastur, Stan o kiir[c], of kingrik caiser, Luuer o lauerd, alsua niter, Nitand he fell, wepand he ras, And cround in passion he was. His nam es giuen til him o ded, And titel of his might o mede, He preched quils he was in liue Namli in þir landes fiue, Capadose, and galathi, In betani, and in asi, And in aland hight itali, þat na man cleps lumbardi. And of signes, schort to rede, Apon þe skaldand see he yede, A ded he quickend wit his schade Quils þat he him for-bi glad. To þe cripels he gaf þam fote, To parlesi þan gaf he bote; Bath ananias and his wife, For suike he dampaid tam o life, þat all suld tak þaim sample bi For to naman do tricheri. Symonmagus, þat jugelur,— þat ledd þe folk wit grett errur, þat in him-self he was so proud He wend to fli out ouer þe cloud, Bot thoru saint petre orisun Sorfulli þan fel he doun,— Quen he of antioche had fund þe kirk, and graytli set on grund, Ogain þis ilk smorn he yede. To rome at turn misleuand lede, O trout spelland wit-outen spar, Fiue wynter was he bischop þar; Sex and thritti winter euen Fra ihesu crist was stei til heuen. In rome throu an þat hight neron Was imperour of þe town, For þe luf of his sermon, Vphang his fette, his hed don, Naild on þe rod he was, Als for be he-self it chas. “His maister,” he said to þam o rome, “And he aght noght haf al a dome, For he was noght worþi þer-till;” þar-for þai dempt him at is will. Birid his bod was þat tide Vt-wit þe toun apon þe est side.

Wit sight he fell, bot blind he ras, Of chesing fetil wroght he was, To þaim he first was verreur, And after-ward be-com prechur, Schep o wolf, and mek of fell, In chesing last, formast in spelle. His kitth was þars þat he bred in, Cummen of þe kind of beniamin, þe toþer yeir of þe assencion, Tok he baptim, and gun sermon. Fra he had tan þe apostlis hade, Was nan sua mikel trauael mad, Godds word to spell and spred O-mang all mis-leuand lede.

A dai and of a night to stound He was stad atte see ground; A gast o gile o way he draf þat in a maiden bodi claue; A child þat thoru a fal was slain, He gaf him hel and liif o-gain; A jugelur wit blindnes he smat, To halt o ganging gaf he stat; þe nedder o venum sa strang, Noght he skurnd wit hir stang, Bot on his hand þer scho was fest, He schok and in þe fir hir kest; Man þat in feuer was vnfer He held þam wit his praier. Ful mani war þas ilk torfere, þat he gun drei for drightin dere Apon his aun flexs and blod; First o þe iuus þat at war wod, þat on him sterrand ai wit wa, And o þe haiþen folk alsua. Mani wreched-hed i tald, Trauail in hunger, threst, inald, Scipbreging he suffurd thrise, And ans was he beft, and wenis, A hundret wayes atte leist, Bath mang men and riuand beist. In preson oft he lay in wath, In mirknes and in bandes bath, To-quils þe juus him held in band And taght him haiþen men in hand. He was sua stanid on sum dai, Vneths he bar lif a-way, In lepe ouer walles was laten down, Hard in prese and in prisown; Thoru a nerth-din þat þer was þar-wit was he laten passe. Siþen at rome vnder neron, þat jmperowr was o þe tun, For þat he preched goddes word Hefdid he was wit dint o suord. þat ilk [day], þat ilk yere, þat petre martird was, his fer; And on þe west half o þat cite Birid o cristen men was he.

Of wituten ani wite, Herods did his hefd smite, Siþen was his bodi tan And laid in kist o marbil stan. [John the Evangelist.] [I]Ohn, maiden, iams broþer, Mar luued wit crist þan ani oþer, þat sua til him he bar him nest þat he slep a-pon his brest; And o þe wel o witt he dranc,— þat o reson was nan sa ranc,— In spelling he bicom sa wis, Als þou a flum o paradise. þe grace o godds word he spred To þam þat he to lagh has ledd; And left in crist aun stedd Als he was of him-seluen bred, His maister moder þar he laght, þat was disciple to be taght, Maiden kep to maiden clen, Als he a-noþer sun had ben. In asie slelled þis ilk iohan: An jmperur, domician, Did him to flem in-til an yle, þar he was in a tuelf mor quile; þe bok o scheuing þer he wrat, Spekand o mikel priue stat. þat Imperur wend him to mat In a tun was welland hat; Fild of oyle he did him schott, Bot noþer him harmd, hefd ne fott. For als he was o lust vn-lame Als was vnwemmed his licam. He did miracls, sa wel he moght,— O treind wandes gold he wroght, O grauel bi þe se side Stanes precius o pride, And efter-ward wit crists main þam turnd to þair kind egain. He raisd þe widue drusian, þat was ded, and a yongman; Venim he drank wit-outen wath, þe prusund men he raisd rath þat war standed for suilk a drink; And quen he lang had liued in suink, Efter sexti yer and seuen Sin our lauerd was stei til heuen, Ful-fild of eild, quen þat he sei His ending dai him neghand nei, First he did his graf to deluen, And siþen he laid þer in him-seluen. Quen he had said his orisun, In þat graf he laid him dun, (Als it is in þe stori tald) His saul to ihesu crist he yald, In þe cithi of hephesim; Men wenis tarfor þarof him He is noght ded, als mani sais, Bot slepand ligges he alwais, For þat erth, þai sai, vmstund Men sais vprisand fra þe grund, And als a slepand aends oft It bers þe pudre vp o-loft, Als a thing war vnder quick,— þe landes folk it wil noght nick. [Philip.] [P]Helipp was of bethaida Born, and petre was alsua, To þe franckis prechid he Wonand be-side þe mikil see; In herpoli and in frigi, Don he was on rod thri.

He prechid tar wit fote he yede To pers, and parth, and folk o mede, And to þe folk was in hirthane, To þam of inde and batriane. Fast he soght þat estrin thede, And thirlid intil haiþen-hede, And tar he henthid his sermon, Bituix-and til his passion. In a cite hight calamine, Of inde flexsli þer tok he fine, Smiten thoru þer wit a sper, And his bodi is birid tere. [Bartholomew.] [B]Arthelmeu borne a sulie, He prechid in lathaonie, And witnes o matheu we find, Godspell he turnd in tung of ind. And siþen in a tun alban O mikel armenie was tan, And pind wit ful hard paine, For quick þai had his bodi flain. [Matthew the Evangelist.] [M]Atheu, a-postil and wangeliste, O leui cald &amp; chosin &amp; cald o crist, First he was a puplican And siþen o gods spellers an; He speld first in iudea, And siþen in macedonia For sarmoning o gods word, Men sais he stiked was wit suord.

In his geting þe feind of hell Sal crepe in his moder to duell, Maistur of errur and of pride, þar-in he sal his birth abide. þof he be nu in prisun bunden, Als it in hali writt es funden, þat seint gregor self has wroght; þar-for he sais, he lies noght, þe kind o strenght þat he had ar, þof þan his might be laten mare, þat his might es noght sal yee knaun; Vr lauerd has don it als for his aun, For if he moght, al wald he quell; Forþi he bunden has þat fell, He sal be lesed þan o band, And mikel wa sal werc in land. þis es he þat sorful dring, We rede of in bok o sceuing; An angel, he sais, i sagh lendand Wit a mikel cheigne in hand, And bar þe kai o þe mikel pijt, Als sais Sant Iohn in hali writt. To þe dragun suith he wan, þat men calles deuel and sathan, And in þat pitt him sperd fast, To-quils a thusand yeir at þe last, For to be laisd at þe last Quen þat thusand yeir war past, To walk his forth fra þat quile, And mani man for to bigile. The king o pride þis ilk es he, And euer it sal him foluand be; And als it in vr leuedi light,— þe hali-gast thoru godds might,— And vmlaid hir wit his lem To brede þat blisful barntem, þat al þat birth sco þar suld brede Suld hali be of his godd-hede; Right sua þe deuil sal descend, In anticrist moder lend, To fill þat caitif ful vnclene, And vmbelai hir al bidene, Al in his weild hir to receiue, And do hir þoru a man conceue, þat al þat birth þat þar es born Be wick, and fals, and felun lorn. Forþi his nam es cald wit right Sun o tinsel, þat maledight; For al þat he may wirc þar-to, Al manskind he sal fordo. Of his geting i tald yow ar, Of his birth I tell youu quar, For als þat crist him-seluen chese Be born in bethleem for ur ese, His maidenhede for to bring in place þat he tok for us wit his grace, Right sua sal þe feind him þis Chese him stede o birth iwise, þat best es titeld til his stall, Quar es þe rote of iuels all, þar lest o godd men makes min þat es, tun o babilon wit-in. þis tun was quilum chefe o pers, O mani other alsua diuers, A tun o selcuth mikel pride, Hefd o maumentri þat tide; Bethsaida and corozaim, þir tua cites sal foster him.

To iurselem sal he siþen fare, All þat he cristen finds þare If þai wil noght turn til his lare, He sal þam sla witvten spare. And in þe temple o salamon þan sal þat traitur sett his tron; þat al was feld lang siþen gan, He sal do rais it eft o stan. Circumcise him þar he sall, And godds sun him do to call. þe grett kaisers and þe kinges, And all suilk oþer lauerdinges, Turn þai sal til him titest, And siþen þaas other at his list. Ouerall þar crist was wont to ga, He þaim sal ouer-gang alsua, Bot first he sal do alle destru þat halud was of ur lauerd iesu. Siþen ouer al þis werld wide, He sal send sand wit mikel pride, His prechurs for to spell his will, All for þe cristen lagh to spill. Fra est to west, fra north to soth, He sal do mak his sarmun cuth; He sal do mani signe to sene þat man ne has of forwit sene; Thoner o-loft fal sal he gar, And tres brathli blomes bere; Brathli to do þe se be reth, And brathli to do it be smeth.

For penance is þat toþer bord, þat fletand flittes man ouer ford, Quen schippe is broken oght wit sin, It schal him hauen of merci win, For þar es namle bote o tuin, Mai bring man vte of bale and sin; þe first es baptim o þir tua, þe toþer liue in penance thra, For king þat all craftes can, Sua gamli has þou graithid for man, þat þou wil neuer lat him for-far, Bot he will algat leue þi lare. þou wasch us first of adam plight, In funt quen we were cristen dight, Sua clene if we do þi wiss, It suld us bring til heuen bliss.

And þat noght ans allan, ne tuis, Bot quen we fall ai mai we ris; For es na man sa gret mai sin And he in time þer-of wil blin, And mak to preist his costes cuth, Wit reuth of hert and scrifte o mouth, þat he ne his merci has in hij, If he haf hope in his merci. For mar it es his merci sene, þan all þe sinnes þat has bene, Or sal be to þe werlds end, To man þat will his sines amend. For na mar þan a sparc in see, Mai sin agains his merci be, And drightin self he has us het Thoru þe muth of his prophet, Quen sinful man his wai will lete, He sal þe find of merci suete, And crist he sais þat mare ioi es Wit in þe curt of heuen blis, Wit his angels wonand þare, Of a sinful reuand sare, þan of a hundret lele of dede, þat of penance had neuer nede. þou sinful, be þan war wit-all In wreche wanhop þat þou ne fall, For i sal scheu þe samples fele þat warand may mi sagh for lele.

Qua sinful o þair flexs has ben þat thinc on mari magdalene, For alsuith als sco hir sin for-thoght, Crist hir til his merci broght.

For mai naman mis-prais þe thing þe quilk es broght to god ending, And þat es praised o neuer an þat in wick ending es tan. For-þi late es penance to do Quen na man grace es granted to, Bot rightwisnes o goddes wrak Sal setenes o man sines tak; For qua þat dees in dedli sin Sal duell in bale, wit-vten blin, And sua we find ful redeli, Bot dome be turned in-to merci. þou cristen man! for-þi ta kepe, And let þi sin noght wit þe slepe, Bot als suith als þou þe mai Wit scrift þou wasch it al awai, And folu þou sua þi prist red, þat þou mai traistli bid þe ded. If þat he penance on þe lay, þou hald it efter þat þou mai, For þat þou mai noght do to end To ending fir sal þou be send, To duell þar-til he ful be driuen Forqui þat þou was for-wit scriuen, Els moght moght na clensing fire þi saul skur to make it schirre; Bot suld it drei endles panance þat neuermar war of couerance, þar has þi schrift sett end o pyne, þat elles war wit-vten fine. And þat es a fair grace o blis þat crist has granted sua til his, þan es ful god penance to do, To quiles vr time lastes þer-to, For better es here sum hard to drei, þan þar to thol þi saul to dei. A pine es þar to thol harder þan al þat we in flexs mai bere, For drei ai mai þi saul paine, Bot neuer mare be fulli slaine. And þer-bi sais us sant austin, Spekeand o thre maners o pine, “Man,” he sais, “quin cuth þou fele Hu pine o þis lijf sauure wele, And hu botesum it es to drei þat lastes bot a littel wei?” And þou cuth vnder-stand hu sare þat þe fire o clessing ware, Of al and al þou wist hu snell It es to drei þe paine of hell, How hard it es, and vntholand, And hu wit-vten end lastand. For-suth i wat þou wald ful fain Chese þe to thol first pain, And bede to þe first o þaa þat þou moght flee þe oþer tua. For es na man sinful mai flee þat he ne most an drei o þir thre, Is na man liuand in þis lede, To do penance þat hen has ned; Sin nan mai lijf wit-vten sin, All aght luue scrift and tar in. Bot for i find fone in þis lijf þat can wele þam-seluen scrif, Bath o yong and ald men, þat ilk dai neu ar to ken, þat on þam-self can sai nathing Bot þai ha first a sermoning; And þat me think war littel ned, Ilkan aght knaw þar aun ded, And puruai þam wit als bare Quar-for to sai ar þai com þare. þerfor haf i worght þis bok hir Vnto þe leud men to lere, Qua oft-sith will gar it rede, To lagh o scrift it will þam lede; And aght man for to hald it dere And precius wit-vten pere, þat gis consail bath god and lele, Namli for man saul hele; Sin saul has na mak o pris All aght to kepe it þat ar wis.

And sua to man at vnder-stand þat it mai to þi erand wail, And þat i tine noght mi trauail. [Three means of penance.] Qua rightwis penance wil bigin, He sal haue thinges thrin wit-in, Reuth þat es, forthincing sare, And scrift to mak o muth al bare, And buxum beting o misdede; Ilkan þir thre of oþer has nede. And þar es resun sett for-qui For man he sinnes threfaldli, þat es in thoght, in word, in wark, Als jerome sais, þe god clerk; And for we sin on maners thre, Vr scrift aght thrifald for to be. þe first sin fals in thoght Es quen we think on iuel oght, þe toþer it es to-held þar-till,— þe first was thoght wit wicked will And wit foluing to fal in dede,— þe thrid es wers of alle we rede, To lig and lit vs in vr sake, And siþen wil na mendes make. þir thre be takens thre-sum þat we Redand in þe gospell se, þat crist al ras fra ded to lijf Omang his mightes þat war rijf; þe first a man we find of-redde At ham was liggand in hir bedde, And sco be-takens sin o thoght; þe toþer was a chilld broght Vnto þe yate o þat cite, And sin o worde bitakens he; þe thrid was la?arus þat lai Stinkand in graue þe ferth dai, And bitakens al ur sin þat we wit custum ligges in. Reuth and contricion al es an, A soruing for man sins es tan Wit god will man scrift to mak, And penance for his plight to tak. And þis we find o commandment, Thoru prophet in þe ald testament. And thrifald aght þis soruing be, For it es sett in stages thre, Bitter, for we haf don o-mis Again him þat vr lauerd es, Bitterer, for we mad him wrath þat wroght us and vr fede bath, Al-þer bitterest, for þat he Boght us apon þe rode tre, Fra might of vr wyþer-win Fra bitternes of hell pin. þar makes contricion thre thinges þat man till his thinking bringes, Scham þat man thinkes of his sinnes, Thoght and þar-of first biginnes, Letting of his solin sake, And dred of last dai o wrake; Tinsel of þat land o blis þat lastes ai wit-vten mis, And wrething of þat fader dere þat wroght vs quen we noght ne were. þe sinful man þat wil ha quert, þir aght him do ha reuth in hert, þis reuth agh and i-þen be Wit will to scrife and mend ai þe. Sua sar þin sakes to for-thingk þat soru thoru þin hert sink, þat þou mai sai al wit þe prophet, “Mi weping mas mi bed al wet, þat has me ben in stede o fode, Mi sin has mad me soruful mode.” And þer-bi sais vs sant daui, “Lauerd,” he sais, “ic am redi For to thol þi castiment, Mi soru es euer me redi ment.” þe werkes o þis reuth we mai Bi werkes of it-seluen sai, It es o sinful man a sare He can noght wit him-seluen spare, And it agh be sa selle wonder Als þof his hert him brest in sunder. For anger, and for schame, and tene þat we sua wicked men has bene; þarfor agh sinful man and wijf On þis maner þair hert to rijf, And stand it if it nede to be Wit thorn, glaiue, nail, wit al thre, Wit quilk þat crist for us was stongen Efter he was wit skurges suungen. þis reuth es like a castand gin, Scailand a hepe es samen o sin þat stud bi-tuix us als a wall, And drightin, þat has wroght us all. It brekes als þe findes band, And harls sinful of his hand. Of hell it harus heiis þe hard prisun þat fend had made to sinful bun, And stalworthli it dos to stint þe findes o þat þai do ha mint. Als samson, þat first tint his hare And of his strenght was mad al bare, Was don in prisun als we find, Bath was geldid and mad blind, Als he couerd siþen his fax, His strengh wital began to wax, He schok tua postes þe hus to fall His fas, he slogh him-self wit-all. Right of a penance es al plain, Quen his har has geten again, þat es quen he has couerd þe seuen Giftes o þe gast of heuen, þe quilk he had al forwit tint Ar he can of his sinnes stint; Nu thoru reuth he has o sin þan mai he schak þaa postes tuin, O lust o flexs, o pride o lijfe, þis his skakand don dos he drijfe, And skail sua þat es of hell þat he most wit him-seluen duell, And slas him-self þat he was are And wrathes nanman forþer mare. Reuth clensses saul o plight and sak, And schildes man fra waful wrake, And sundres felauschipe þat was Bituix þe saul and sathanas. Al gastli god again it winnes þat man had forwit tint for sinnes, Bot scortli he ne was bot tint If he ne had of his folis stint, Reuth þan makes þam him godssun, Holy wit him-self to won. And quer man þat has reuth allan Bot he ne has scrift þ?spyer man Quar he sal haf for-giuenes O sinnes þat he vnscriuen es, þar es set gain þis resun O sere men sere opinion; Sum sais þat als þe sin es wroght Thre-fald, wit word, dede, and thoght, Alsua has man nede of thrin Maners for to bete þair sin, And bot if it bete be thrifald, Al his dede for noght es tald. Sum oþeir sais sin es for-giuen Wit reuth allan to man vnscriuen, Bot þat es at vnder-stand in-dede, Quen sinful man es stad in nede, þat he mai noþer scrift cum to Ne nan oþer mendes do. Bot þou sal not þe-queþer vnder-tak þat reuth allan forgiues þe sak, Bot crist him-self thoru reuth allan, þat inwardli in hert es tan, For first be-houes þe grace be send þat man ha reuth and will to mend, Grace it es be-for cumand, And siþen him folus luue neist hand. For qua þat grace has in him clere, Luuand es he wit-vten were, And reuth has he þat luuand es, And cums he sua to forgiuenes. [The second point of shrift.] þe toþer pont es scrift o muth To mak to preistes vr costes cuth, Of al vr plight to be vn-knaun, Wit will to bete þat we ha schaun.

And þan we sal þe pointes rede þat warrai scrifte al of has nede; And þar-wit-al sum questiones We sal vndo þe merk resons, And tell we siþen quilk ar þaa, þat draus man scrift and penance fra, And for to tell sum-thing þer neist þat to þe mister falles o prist.

For sli man riueli moght him bring, In mistrouth and in mistrauing.

For crist forgiues noght a sake Bot we of all vr mendes make, And sin þis sinn was neuer forgiuen, Nedinges most it neu be scriuen; For hu mai we wot ani dett, þat haldes gilt forgiuenes gett, And quils þat neunes es in wonde Es plaster nan mai mak it sond; Namar it mai þe saul of sin To-quils it stikand es þar-in, And it es stikand euer emeþend, þat sothfast scrift has driuen to þe hend, And þat mai be on namaner, Bot haldand scrifte and sin for-ber. þi scrift agh to be mad hernestly, Noght als intent o waynglori, Or als þis ypocrites dos In mans sight, in mans ros, And als sum men in scubardis Til oþer men telles þair folis, And sais amang riot ron “Alle men wat wel þat i ha don;”— Bot scrift sal be wit clene entent, In will to do amenddement. Willili lok þat þou be scriuen, Noght wit strength þar-to be driuen, For neding scrift mai ha na mede; Wittnes o sir caym dede, þat þou be yeitt his wicked-hede It moght him to no merci lede, For he was cald and ouer tane þat he hade his broþer slayn.

Als þe hali writte us schaus, Four thinges us fra penance draus, Hope and wanhope, schame and dute, For þe warlau es euer a-boute Man to do in sin at lend, And þer-wit tak him at his hend. þishope þan mai be thrine-fald, Quen man cums to ouer bald. For licing o lijf, for warlds wine, For godds grith als traisting in, Hop es god at hald wit houe, Bot til vnskil noght worth a gloue. Again þe ferst us sais sant Iam, “Quat es mans lijf bot fam, And a rek þat mai noght last, Bot skailles wit a windes blast.” Sant Iob sais, “man born o wijf Hu littel lastand es his lijf!” Sant paule sais of vr last dai, “Es nan mai certain þer-of sai, Bot cums it als a theif be night, And hides him fra mans sight, Bot quen man wens al-þer best Pes haue and sikernes and rest, þan sal he cum and naman warne, Als baret dos on wijf wit barne.” And þat he findes all will quell, For-þi crist biddes in gospell, “Wakes,” he sais to cristen men, “For yee wat noþer quar ne quen, Ar or late, on day or night, þe lauerd will cum tok þe his might; For-þi bes war and tak god kepe þat he find yow noght on slepe.” Again þe toþer hoping þat es In werldes welth hald sikernes, We find a sothfast sample laid, Hu a riche til him-seluen said, “Lijf,” he said, “be glad and blith, For þou has soght in all þe sith Werldes welth to lijf in pese, Nu ete and drinc and mak at es.” To quam cu[m] uoice it said, “þou sotte, To-night þai sal cum þe to fott, þe findes, þat es for to say, Sal haue þi wreche saul a-wai.

And, als i tald noght siþen lang, þof man sin be neuer sa strang, Or neuer ha lin sa lang þer-in, And he will rise and bete his sin, þat he ne mai haf o merci state And hope þer-till þof it be late. þe thridd letting mas mani madd, Quen þai vn-mesurli ar radd Efter rising to fall egain, And mistrus in þair aun main, And sli mis-hope þat þai lij in, Ne dar þai nakin god bigin.

[Pride.] And for pride es þe formast sin, Of him to spek I wil begin. And þar es namli tuin thinges Þat riuelist pride of springes. Pride es a lust, i sal noght lei, His aun stat þat man wald hei; And rises it, qua soth mai se Riuelist o thinges thre, O warlds happe, o grace and kind, Efter þat we in writtes find; Werlds happe, and clath, and fode, Hus or rent or oþer gode, Mensk, riches, and priuete, Welth, or lauerdscipp, or pouste.

A wreth þare rises redi bun Missau and flitt and malison, Wrang fare den, baning, vpbraid, Bath nentes godd and man es said; Thrett, buffett and dedes dint, Bolning of hert and resun tint, Vnheind talking, o dede vtrage, Lates misledd, lightness o rage, Hurtes grett, and sclander and tene; Þir ar þe springes o wreth fythtene. Wreth it es a brath on-fall, Menging o mode þat cums o gall; It es a cruel thing and crus Þat droues mani man in hus; Flites, scendes and misdenisse, Man aun wiit it fra him cleuisse; It reuis man of body might, And mas him blind in his ee-sight, O luue riueli brekes band, And lettes consail for to stand; It wentes man fra godd his will And mas him derf to dedis ill; It leses man liif, and na pite Mai þare it lendes funden be; Hattred it es, and ir to strang Þat has in hert ben halden lang, And oft sith it has ben soth, Quen wicked will it forth has broght. Again þis sinn es best to take, God tholmodenes for crist sake, To suffer bath ur welle and wa, And giltles to forgiue ur fa. [Sloth.] O suernes cums care to strang And þat vnmetele lastand lang For tinsel o þis werlds gode, Þat man vmquile wexus wode, Þat he gain godd wil seluen striue, And quilum dos him-self o liue; And in mining of his mistime He wites wend and waris his time, And sua he mengges him wit ire, Þat brennes mans mede als fire; Reccles-laic in mede and ded, Quen bath o spek and ded es nede, Swilk heuines o mans hert Þat reckes noght his aun quert, And in talent has don al-way Þat god him list do ne sai; And if he has bigunnun oght, Biliffit als him noght ne roght, And quilum for heuines o mode Bigin ne dar he do na gode. Wanhope it es foluand here-bi, Þat wreche man dos tine merci, For þat sin es gain hali-gast, Þat giues for sin forgifnes mast; Vn-ro of hert vm-quile to lere, Lathnes to kirc at sermon here, Dreching o scrift, vnnait talckhing, Vnstedfastnes, o will wandring, Hardnes of hert and vnboand, Þat ai in ankin stat wit-stand, Heui chere, crustful and ill, Vntimes spech or to be still; O þis bicums presumpcion, Þat es hoping of vnreson; Bot vr lauerd, for na sin, Will latte nan fra his merci tuin. Þis sin es gains god rightwisnes, For albeit suagat þat he es Merciful, als al mai se, Wel wat rightwis es he, And for rightwisnes es him in, Riueli tas he wrak for sin. Again þis sin remedi es— Haf gastli ioi and hope o blis, And do þe god bath day and night, To gete forgyuenes of vr plight. [Coveteousness.] Þe first sin es o couaitise Þat reuis mani man þair praise; O þis cums blindnes and tresun, Reuelaic, theft, extorsium, Als quen man haldes wran[g]wis strif Þat oþer men mai lede na liif, No na neghbur mai hafe þair saght Til þai haue gin him o þair aght; Strenth, þat lauerding agh to meild, Þat o þair men tas wrangwis yeild, Fals foluing, fals wittnesing, Vnknaun lage, manath, and lesing; Iuel eging, ocur and symoni, Als gastli thing to selle or byi, Morth, brinning, manslaghter and suik, Wasting and were and oþer slik; Sacrilege, to reue or stele Of halud thing, os dose nu fele; Gredines and nithinghede, To be o goddes gyft to gnede; Alkin talking wrangwisli, And all halding wit trecheri. Ogain þis sin es bote o scrift, Lele of hert and fre of gyft, And for þe luue o crist sake, Þis wrech werlds welth forsak; And wiit yee wele it es ful strang. Haf other men aght ani wrang, Þou agh it for to yeild again, If þou þar-til has might or main, If þou þam find, namli to þaa Þe quilk þat aght was nomin fra; If þai ne be funden noght, or dede, O scrift þou do þi faders rede, Sua þat þi saul mai ai be quite, And þin airs mai haf prophite For þar es sinnes foun, iwise, Wers for to mend riueli þan þis, For euer þe plight es foluand pain, Til wrang takinyng be quite again. [Glutony and Drunkenness.] O glotori and o drunkenhede Fele wick branches se we sprede, Þat heuis man and reuis him hele For to gang and for to mele And reuis him als of ei þe sight, And hert and hefd þair aun in-sightt; For be man neuer sa wise in lede, Quen he es ouerlaid wit drunkenhede, Þan in his mankidhed, als wele we wate, Es turnd al into best state; It dos man consail to be tald And o fole bateil to be bald, And man folik be traist and glad, Quare he wit resun suld be radd, At aunter man aun might, Wit-vten armour it dos him fight. Þe drunken semes in his misfare Noght lik þe man þat he was are; Bot schortly al iuels þat es Riueli becums of drunkenness, For all þat euer festis wiit, Drunkennes þan skailes it. And it es funden bodili Foure-kin maner of glotory, Oþer forwit [beg]inne at hete, Or for to sitt to lang at ete, For to yern als many mese, Or for to gredi be at dese. Þare es beting again þis last, Mesure o mete and drinc to tast, And sua vr flexs to firþer and fede, Þat it fale in na dedli dede. [Lechery.] O luchery þat lust has ledde We may se many branches spredde, Als fole fredom and lesing spoken, Wordes o ros and trouthes broken, Fole behalding, misleding o late, Þat man may se be lichur state, Þat giues his wijt sua to sotthede, Þat nan es laft him-self to lede; Fole contenance and ful scruding, Hurtling o sculder, of hend casting, And harlot sagh, speche o disur, Rimes vnright, gest of Jogolur. It wastes bodi and als catel, And reues man liif and als saul hele. Þof þat þis sin has branches fele, O sex allan þan wil i mele; Fornicacion es an, Don wit anlep woman; Spusbrek es betuix tua, Þat spused ar bath, or an o þaa; Incest, þat es for to lij Bi þat þi sibman has line bi, Or if þat has don þat sin Wit ani of þin aun kin, Sacrilege es tald as an, O þat order he has tan, And all þat high[t] has chastete To crist, quar þai be sco or he; Sodomite þat ful o stinc, Þe sinn þat did þe cites sinc; Hu ful þat sin for godd was sen, Was sceud wit his wengeance ken, For þair cost was sua vnkind, Alle þai war to askes brind; Þis branche es als at vnderstand, Quen man es filed all wackand. Forthermar o þis lecheri Agh i þe noght to specifie; Bot lok þou self, vmthinckand te Þat þou in nan suilk plight be, Þat þou ne wit scrift þar-of þe knau, For to me fals it noght to scau; If þou on ani wise has don, Wit open scrift þou mend it son. Vnkindli sin and sodomite, Austin cals al suilk delite, Þat es not tuix womman and man; Þat yit on-kind he clepes it þan, Bot it be wit þaa membris wroght, Þat þar-til es made, and elles noght. Speciale þan cals þis sin Wrak o him þat ligges þar-in, For austin sais þat þoru þis gilt, Es þat felau-reden spilt Þat tuix crist and vs suld be, Sin þat ilk kind þat we Him-seluen haf þan, and sua fordon Again þat trinite in tron. Þis licheri sua ful o wa, It makes man be cristes fa, And all þe halus of his curt wit-in, For-qui it wastes mans kin; Þe iuels þar-of þai ar sa fele, Þat es na muth þat mai þam mele; It es sua greif and god wit gan Þat noght þe ded all of it an, Bot þe muthes o þe neuenand And als þe eres o þe herand, And þe self elementis vmlaid, It files þar it es don or said; If þou man nedd þe euer þar-till At force womman agayn hir will, On fastin dai or hali night, In hali stedd or mans sight, Or handel hir vnhendly, Or kis wit lust o lecheri, Or woud hir wit wordes slight, Or loked wit ouur stedfast sight, Þat þou þer-wit has went hir will, Quare thoru sco was þin bun fulfill, Or has bituix hir scankes gan Or tirid or tut or skirt uptan; If þou þi-self has don sli thing, Or oþer man gert wit þin egging, Or wiche-craft or charmes soght, Or þou þi-self þar-for þam wroght, All suilkin last to lik man in, It es to tell for dedli sin. And yee leuedis, wit your quite hals, And sai to yond maidens als, Yee wene may traist þat es vntreu And studis hu your hare to heu, Hu to dub and hu to paynt, And hu to mak yow semle and quaint, Biletts for-broiden and colers wide, For to sceu wit your quite hide, Wit curchefs crisp and bendes bright, Your scappes schins to mans sight; Thoru your trail bath wide and side, Es not at seke to find your pride, Þat wit thinges and other fele, Fra godd his ranscon ful dere yee stele, Þat es þat ilk saul þat he Cost wit his ded on rode tre; Quen yee yow-self sua slight and slike Yee sai þat men you wille be suike, And yee þam in þair marchandise Bisekins oft þaa wreches vnwise, Quen yee sa bede your war to sell, Þe fole marchandis eth to duell, Þat quen þai see your dubbing ware, O þairis sumthing be-houis þam ware; And quils þai wen bii gold all fine, Of sith þai bii þam hell pine.

Þir are þe branches o licheri And maa þan i can tell þar-bi, Bot i ha said þir at þe leist, For þai ar funden communest. O licheri agayn þe spere Wit chastite þou sal þe were; Be clene in bodi and in hert, Þan sal þou saue þi saul quart. Nu er þe seuen sinnes redd, Wit þair branches o þam spredd, Bot þat mai foru þam ilkan þat tung ic hope in erth es nan, And for naman mai recken ham alle, Mani sinful chances þat mai fall, þarfor ilkan i rede for-loke þat þai ripe wele þair aun boke, And skir þam sua wit þair in-sight, þair conscience sua clene and bright, þat þai þar-in leue nakin thing þat ani nede haf o scuring, Als farr as sum þam mai min Wit sothfast scrift and reuth o sin, And þat for-geten es þam fra, þai prai to godd forgiue þam þaa All sceus þat i haf for-wit said, Hugat man agh to scrift be graid. [How to make shrift.] Bot nu sal i tell þe her nest Hu þu sal sceu þi scrift to preist, And i will first at pride be-gin, þat prince es of all oþer sin, þat landmen mai sumquat lere, To scape þair scrift wit þis samplere. Qua þat o sin o pride will rise, He sal him scriue on þiskin-wise, “Til our lauerd crist and þe, Mi gastli fader, yeild i me, Plighti for my syn o pride In pointes þat i sal vn-hyde. In vayn glory haue i libyng, For fayr-hede, force, and clethyng, For redy tung or costykyn, For likyng gode of werldes wyn, And for my scrud þat i was in, Gaf i man sample for to syn; To men and wemmen bath i wate, þat oft i helde my lightly late. To my lard ic am of-sene To crist ic haue vn-buxum bene, þat wortschyp nan til hym bar i, Ne til hys moder, dere mari; Vn-buxum haf i bene, and thra A-gayn my gastly fader al-sa; Gayn haly kyrk was i rebell, Gain fader and moder fers and felle, Qua chastid me, me thoght hethyng, And snybbyd þam þair chastyyng; Gayn my better haue i bene Bath in dedes and wordes kene, Wit grochyng strijf and wit bakbite, Wrangwys haue i wryþen wyte. Ic ha me rosed in my mode Bath o my werkes wyc and gode, O dedes þat i ded noght Ne neuer may falle come in my thoght, Quen men me rosed oft i me heied, þou þai mai falle opon me leied, And for me liked þat þai wald say I said not ans þar-wit nai. Oft ic ha roued soth or lese þat i wyst noiþer queþer it wese; Ic ha me gernd vt-wit be sene Better þan i wit-in ha bene, þe grace þat godd me has lent I thank hym noght wit gode entent; Wit wislier þat i was amang Haue i striued oft-sithes wrang, And þar i tok a word to were I ne lete it falle on non manere; And titter wald i lesyng make, þan man my worde vn-treu to take. And quen þat i to striueyng yede, I wald oft songyng for my lede, An lay on oþer men my wyte, For to mak me-seluen quite. And þar myn aun plight was all I said i myght noght do wit-all, Or sayd my scryft wit wordes queme þat my syn þe lesse suld seme, And i may fall ha left vm-quile þe synnes þat war lath and vile.

I womman haue vn-buxum bene And tarid myn husband to tene, In many thyng þat i suld don, And noght queþer my lagh vndon. Ic haue synned thoro envy, And þar-of crist! i cri mercy! Quen i sagh oþer men mistad, Of his sare wald i be gladd, For his ded and his vn-hele, For skath takyng of his catell. Quen i sagh my neghbur wele fare, Min aun soru it was þe mare, For his god fare and his fame, His welth, his wytt, and his god name, I paind oft at him vn-spede, Bath in will and word and dede.

O strif oft haue i oft sauun þe sede To bring my brother to wan-spede; Oft haue i bene ouer mistrauand, Quen i for me na chesun fande, And dempt man as me-self list þof i na wite apon him wist. His loue-worde wald i lette to rise And quar i wist a worthy wise, And þat suilk oþer man war slayn, My-self wald haue part of þe payn.” In þat of wreth will scriue þe hale, On þiskin wise bigin þou sale, “Oft sithe haue i wrethid sare Him þat me gat, here þat me bare, And sume of þaim wit hand i smat, Mi lauerd, my maister, my prelat, Or laid on hand in my sotthed, þat ic am cursed o þe dede.” And here þan agh þou for to telle O suilkin case, hou it be felle, “Again my breþer haue i bene Oft-sith lightly for to tene, Wit flitt, wit brixil, striue and strut, Myn euen-cristen haue i hurt, And oft vn-saght o him i said, And of his lastes gaue vp-braid,— I wald he ware vn-fere or ded,— And bath i procurd þam wit red, Thoru tene of him spak i ille, And did his loue-word for to spille. Oft i was to him wit vn-right, Wit will þat ic on him suld light.

Fasting es þe to-þer thing þat falles to flexsli chastijng, And o þis fast es thrin manere; þe first to mete and drink for-bere, O þis werld þe toþer it es, Baret to bere for-bere þe bliss, þe thrid es better þan þe twa Wit gastli fast all giltes for-ga; And wit þis thrin maner o fast Agh we to hald vr bodi chast, For quat bote is fra mete to min And dedeli for to lig in sin?

O wak wel mai we sample telle For crist vs bidds in gospell, [“Watch, lest ye fall into temptation.”] “Wakes he said and preis wit-all þat yow thar in na fanding fall, For yee wate neuer dai þen night, Yur lauerd wil cum als he has hight, And he to þaim has hight corun þat he ai findes redi bun.” Generali nu haf i tald þe pointes þat ar for to hald Til ilk sinful þat es bun For to do satisfacciun; þat es beting, quar-wit he mai Clenli wasche his plight awai, If he be funden in þam treu His saghtlines þat sal him neu.

First quen man es in wath o ded, Ilk preist þan mai him rede, Wit scrift and soile wit sli couenand, þat quen he lesid es o band Als suith as he mai sesun se, And wend to rome at soilled be. þe toþer of dorward or porter, þat chastis wrang wit þair mister. þat clerk wit laiser smites oght, For hati or ded þai forwit wroght, Bot he ne hurt him oure sare His biscop mai asoille him þare. þe thrid es men religius, þat has þair ouer man in hus, If þai hurt ani o þam a-mang And þe harme be noght ouer strang, þe man þat has þam for to yeme Mai soill þam and þair mendes deme. þe ferth womman and man vn-fere, And child wit-in fourtene ?ere. þe fifte þat sles his fo be strete þat dute of ded war wit to mete. þe sext es thrale on ani wise Dos for to sle his louerd seruise. Of him es sett þe seuend case þat clerk dos bot a litel trespase. þe aghtand es quen man es pouer, Bot þar es couenand if he couer, He sal do bome þir last fiue, Mai biscop soill bath man and wiue. Lagh will þou man clerk smite, In þir cases sal ha na wite. þe first if þou be his maister o lare Bot bete þou him noght ouer sare, For in alkin thing o dede Aght man mesure wit him lede. Als if he in renaijing lijs, Efter þat he es monest thris, Or armes beres fra þat he Thris of his biscop monest be. And quen he chaunges crun or wede, And funden in land mans dede, And sua his aun lagh for-sakes Makand him knyth or widu takes. Or if þou lauerd has, mai fall, Clerk þat es geten of þi thrall, þou mai bete if he als theue His orders stele wit-vte þi leue; And if clerkes be wonand samen, Smites oþer lightli in gamen; And if þou wit þi woman frend Find clerk be doand dede vn-hende, Als moder, doghter, sister, or wijf, For quas honur þou aght to strijf, If þu find clerk þus-gate and smite, Canon it gis him-seluen þe wite. Bot for-þer mar þan i ha tald Ne be þou noght at smite to bald, Alsua sun if þou wers þe, Quen þou na noþer wai mai fle, Alsua if þou þin vn-witand Has laid, mai fall, on clerk þi hand. [Of Communion with the cursed.] I ha tald on serekin sin þat oft man falls cursing in, Nu here nexst i sal þe neuen O þaa cases we find elleuen. þof þou wit cursd man commun þou sal be soyned wit resun. þe first es, if þou noght it wate, þat þat man es in cursed state. þe toþer es woman, carl o feild, And child þat es wit-in eild. þe thrid es case o spused wife þat to bunden es hir life, And if þi fader cursed be His sun þat es in his pouste, And at his fode and chastijng He es vtan o þis cursing. þe fifte quen fader has no gode, And of his cursd sun has fode. þe sext þof þi wijf cursd be, Sco sal noght tine hir dett o þe, In sustenance and oþer thing, þat es o dett aght o spusing. þe seuend es als men of hine þat before þis cursing es tine, þai mai þe serue al for þair lai, Bi-tuixand to þe terme dai. þe aghtand es o man walkand Als pilgrim thoru a cursd land, He mai ta þer, wit-vten sin, His fode to-quiles he duelles þer-in. þe neuent es for þin aun pruu To cursd man mai þu be buu, Askand þe dett he agh þe to Bot als he dos lok þou noght do. þe tend quen þou him gis consaill In thing þat mai his saul a-uaill, And þou þan mai ask þi dett To pai him his es na man sett. þe elleuend es wit right resun Falaus duelland in a commun, þat þai commun bath euen and morun In thing þat mai noght be for-born. [Cursing.] And wit þou cursing thre-fald es, þe tan es mare, þe toþer lesse, þe tan o dome, þe toþer o dede, Als man mai in þe raymund rede. þe first cursing þat cummus o dome, Reuis man godd and has in comune Of hali kirk and sacrementes, His part es done him in defens, And mast es in þis cursing bunden þat in vnbuxumnes es funden. þe toþer cursing all men es in þat liggand es in dedli sin; For þof þai be in comun here, Fra crist þair sauls sundre sere, And cursd man has na pouste Wit ani right to curs þe. Na mare has he, wit-vten dute, To quam þou es noght vnder-lute. Wittand if þou did a sin Anoþer preistes paroch in, þat preist thoru resun o þi plight Mai curs þe þan, for þat es right, þe preist þe mai noght curs alsua, Efter þat þou has cald him fra. And þou sal wijt o thrijn-wijs Mai cursing be tald on right wijs, And þis thre wordes mai þai scau, Will, and chesun, and vn-lau; Will, quen man wit iuel mode, Hattred in and wit wrething wode, Gis his sentence on ani man O chesun es it vn-rightwis tan, Quen man has noþer don ne said, Quar-for sli cursing suld be laid. þat cursing tald vn-laghful es þat ordir wantes and right-settnes O lagh, bot giuen it es ouer-tite, Wit-vten somons and right respite, For-þi es fele rebuted here þat forwit crist self es dere. And man laused here o band þat bunden es wit cristen hand. For þis kirk we be-for us se Mai oft sith be-suiken be, Bot þat kirk þat o soth es þar Mai be-suiken be neuer mare. þir pointes of cursing haf i said, And soth and scortly samen laid, And þar-for sett in titles sere þat þou mai lightloker þam here, Ar þou be laght in findes snarr. Gain cursing gode all es be-warr, And if þou wat þou ert þair-in His soilling seke wit-vten blin, O suilk a man at soilled be þe quilk þou wost þat has pouste. For als þe suerd þat deles in tuin Saul and bodi þat it es in, Sua dos cursing þe saul i-wise Fra him þat wroght þe king o blise, And steres his cristendame fro And liuers him to þe find his foo.
