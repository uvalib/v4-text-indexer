      <field name="fulltext">SONGS AND BALLADS THE LITTLE RED LARK. Oh, swan of slenderness, Dove of tenderness, Jewel of joys, arise! The little red lark Like a rosy spark Of song to his sunburst flies. But till thou art risen Earth is a prison Full of my lonesome sighs; Then awake and discover To thy fond lover The morn of thy matchless eyes. The dawn is dark to me Hark! oh, hark to me, Pulse of my heart, I pray! And out of thy hiding With blushes gliding, Dazzle me with thy day. Ah, then, once more to thee Flying I'll pour to thee Passion so sweet and gay, The lark shall listen, And dewdrops glisten, Laughing on every spray. THE BANKS OF THE DAISIES. When first I saw young Molly Stretched beneath the holly, Fast asleep, forenint her sheep, one dreamy summer's day, With daisies laughing round her, Hand and foot I bound her, Then kissed her on her blooming cheek, and softly stole away. But, as with blushes burning Tip-toe I was turning, From sleep she starts, and on me darts a dreadful lightning ray; My foolish flowery fetters Scornfully she scatters, And like a winter sunbeam she coldly sweeps away. But Love, young Love, comes stooping O'er my daisies drooping, And oh! each flower with fairy power the rosy boy renews; Then twines each charming cluster In links of starry lustre, And with the chain enchanting my colleen proud pursues. And soon I met young Molly Musing melancholy, With downcast eyes and starting sighs, along the meadow bank; And oh! her swelling bosom Was wreathed with daisy blossom, Like stars in summer heaven, as in my arms she sank. THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME. The route has come, we march away, Our colours dance before us, But sorrow's cloud made dark the day That from our sweethearts tore us; My own dear lass she sobbed âadieu,â Her loving arms entwined me, And oft she prayed me to be true To the girl I left behind me. Yes! I'll be true; when steel to steel The ranks of war are rolling, And round us every cannon peal A funeral knell is tolling; Then if from out the battle flame A fatal ball should find me, My dying lips shall bless the name Of the girl I left behind me. But, if in triumph I return To tell a soldier's story, Though proudly on my breast should burn The golden cross of glory, No other maid with magic art Shall break the links that bind me For ever to the faithful heart Of the girl I left behind me. 'TIS I CAN WEAVE WOOLLEN AND LINEN. 'Tis I can weave woollen and linen, The finest folk wear on their backs; So, girls, come give over your spinnin', And wind off your wool and your flax! Five year at my woollen and linen I've woven from mornin' to night, With a heart that beat heavy beginnin', But is leapin' for ever more light. For with guineas full up is the stockin', Sewed safe in the tick of my bed, And 'tis soon that I'll rest without rockin', Since at Shrove with my Willy I'll wed. WHEN I ROSE IN THE MORNING. When I rose in the morning, My heart full of woe, I implored all the song birds Why their mates on the bough To their pleading gave heeding, While Kate still said âNo;â But they made no kind answer To a heart full of woe. Till the wood-quest at noon. From the forest below, He taught me his secret So tender and low Of stealing fond feeling With sweet notes of woe, Coo-cooing so soft Through the green leafy row. The long shadows fell, And the sun he sank low, And again I was pleading In the mild evening glow: âAh! Kitty, have pity!â Then how could she say âNo.â So for ever I'm free From a heart full of woe. 'TIS A PITY I CAN'T SEE MY LOVE. On his flute of gold the blackbird bold Love's tale to his melting mate has told, And now the thieves have started; And o'er the ground, in fluttering round, Enamoured fly, whilst you and I In lonesome pain are parted. But when hearts beat true through the night of sorrow, They're blest the more when the magic morrow Its rosy ray has darted. Fortune may wave her wings and fly, But she'll flutter back again by and by, And crown the constant-hearted. These birds that pair in the April air Forget their faith on the branches bare, By autumn blasts affrighted, And to fresh loves sing with the start of spring; When you and I with a golden ring In joy shall be united. For when hearts beat true through the night of sorrow, They're blest the most when the marriage morrow Its lamp of love has lighted. Fortune may wave her wings and fly, But she'll flutter back to us by and by, And crown the troth we've plighted. WITH THE NORTH. With lip contemptuous curling, She cried, âIs freedom's flag above Fold on fold unfurling, And Patrick pleading love? Oh! yes, when patriots hand in hand Unite to free their foster-land From slavery's accursed band, What true man woos a woman? Then with my bitter scorning Go, live dishonoured, die a slave, Or march to-morrow morning To battle with the brave.â âWe'll steal a march on sorrow,â Our Captain sighed, a soldier grey, âSound the drum to-morrow Before the dawn of day.â But ere the drum's first muffled beat The women crowded down the street, How many never more to meet Their death-devoted heroes. Then as I passed her dwelling, My proud one o'er her casement frame, The sobs her bosom swelling, Leant forth and sighed my name. Oh! have you seen Atlantic Advance his green, resistless line Against the cliffs gigantic, And bury them in brine? Thus on our stubborn foe we fell, Death's lightning darting from our steel, Whilst round us every cannon peal A hero's requiem thundered! And still with forward faces Went down in death our dauntless men. And still into their places As gallant hearts stepped in. Till to a sunburst glorious, That all the field of battle fired, Before our van victorious The sullen South retired. Then peace returned, and from the war Our banner bright with many a star 'Twas mine to flutter from afar In triumph to our city; Till I at last could wreathe it Around my true love's throbbing heart, And we two kissed beneath it, Oh! never more to part. THE SMITH'S SONG. âDing dong, didilium! the big sledge is swinging, Ding dong, didilium! the little hammer's ringing, Ding dong, didilium! set the bellows snoring: Ding dong, didilium! the red fire is roaring.â âHush, boys, and hark, boys, I hear a pair eloping, Hush, boys, and hark, boys, they'll go free, I'm hoping, Ding dong, didilium! I hear a shoe clinking, Ding dong, didilium! there's need of nails, I'm thinking.â âFor Heaven's sake, a shoe, smith!â âYour honor, here 'tis ready; Woa, mare, and so, mare, and steady, girl, steady! Ding dong, didilium! off goes the carriage, Ding dong, didilium! good luck be with the marriage.â âHush, boys, and hark, boys, I hear the kettle-drumming, âDrimin dhu, drimin dhu,â King James's horse are coming; Up, on the thatch, where my pretty pikes are hidden, And have them all handy and bright when you're bidden.â âFor Heaven's sake, the pikes, smith!â âThey're here for your picking, Long pikes and strong pikes, and pikes for Dutchmensticking! Ding dong, didilium! cursing in their cruppers, Here jog the Mynherrs, 'tis time for our suppers.â MO MOIREEN DHU. When I sailed away To win wealth for you O'er the stormy sea, O mo moireen dhu! On the western wave A black pirate knave Bore me off his slave From mo moireen dhu! And I should work For the tyrant Turk, In cruel chains, beneath the scorching sun, And never hear, when the dreadful week was done, Bells for Christian prayer Calling through the air. Till a Moslem maid, For the love of me, With her artful aid, Stole and set me free. But no soft collogue With that charming rogue, Mo moireen oge, Turned my heart from thee, And I'm home at last O'er the ocean vast, My good red gold, in gaily glittering store, Into mo moireen's modest lap to pour; While with magic swell Wakes our marriage bell. SONG OF THE GHOST. When all were dreaming But Pastheen Power, A light came streaming Beneath her bower: A heavy foot At her door delayed, A heavy hand On the latch was laid. âNow who dare venture, At this dark hour, Unbid to enter My maiden bower?â âDear Pastheen, open The door to me, And your true lover You'll surely see.â âMy own true lover, So tall and brave, Lives exiled over The angry wave.â âYour true love's body Lies on the bier, His faithful spirit Is with you here.â âHis look was cheerful, His voice was gay; Your speech is fearful, Your face is grey; And sad and sunken Your eye of blue, But Patrick, Patrick, Alas! 'tis you!â Ere dawn was breaking She heard below The two cocks shaking Their wings to crow. âOh, hush you, hush you, Both red and grey, Or you will hurry My love away. âOh, hush your crowing, Both grey and red, Or he'll be going To join the dead; Oh, cease from calling His ghost to the mould, And I'll come crowning Your combs with gold.â When all were dreaming But Pastheen Power, A light went streaming From out her bower; And on the morrow, When they awoke, They knew that sorrow Her heart had broke. COLLEEN OGE ASTHORE. When I marched away to war, How you kissed me o'er and o'er: Weeping, pressed me; Sobbing, blessed me; Colleen, colleen oge asthore. I was wounded, wounded sore, Dead, your father falsely swore; Mad to harry You to marry One with miser-gold in store. Ah! but when you dreamed me dead, Forth you flew a wildered maid: Ever grieving, Ever weaving Willow, willow for your head. âNay, he lives,â your mother said, But you only shook your head; âWhy deceive me? Ah! believe me, Mother, mother, he is dead.â So you pined and pined away, Till, when in the winter grey Home I hasted, Wan and wasted, Colleen, colleen oge, you lay. â'Tis his lonesome ghost,â you said, âCome to call me to the dead;â âNay, discover Your dear lover Longing now at last to wed.â Then your cheek, so pale before, With the rose of hope once more, Faintly, slowly, Brightly, wholly, Blossomed, colleen oge asthore. Till upon the chapel floor, Side by side, we knelt and swore, Duty dearest, Love sincerest, Colleen, colleen oge asthore. A SAILOR LOVED A FARMER'S DAUGHTER. A sailor once wooed a farmer's daughter, The fairest lass in all the country side. She loved him well; but when he besought her With beating, beating heart to be his bride, âA sailor lad,â she said, âI'll never, never wed, And live a wife and widow all in one; O no, my charmer shall be a farmer, Returning faithful with the set of sun.â At danger's call, across the water The sailor went, but left his heart behind; Fresh lovers whispered the farmer's daughter; Yet when they prayed her to confess her mind, âA farmer's lad,â she said, âI'll never, never wed, When heroes bleed to guard their native strand. Till war is over I need no lover: Then let the stoutest soldier claim my hand.â When peace returned, escaped from slaughter, With stars and crosses home our warriors came, And some went wooing the farmer's daughter, But none could charm the lass to change her name; Until once more from far a gallant, gallant tar Began with beating heart his love to tell; And sweetly turning, with blushes burning, She sighed: âSince first we met I've loved you well!â THE REAPER'S REVENGE. Often I dream of the day, asthore, With secret sighs and laughter, When you went reaping the oats before, And I came gathering after. And tenderly, tenderly with the corn Looks of love you threw me; Till I stood up with eyes of scorn And withered your hopes to woo me. Often and often I'm dreaming still, With tears and smiles together, Of the month I stretched so weak and ill In the wild and wintry weather. While tenderly, tenderly, you would tap To know the news of Nora; Till I grew fonder of your rap Than my father's voice, acora! But most I remember the plan concealed That through the spring amused you, To watch till you found me in the field Where in autumn I refused you, Then earnestly, earnestly, in my eyes To gaze, till I returned you The look of looks and the sigh of sighs, On the spot where once I spurned you. THE BLUE, BLUE SMOKE. Oh, many and many a time In the dim old days, When the chapel's distant chime Pealed the hour of evening praise, I've bowed my head in prayer; Then shouldered scythe or bill, And travelled free of care To my home across the hill; Whilst the blue, blue smoke Of my cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing, Waved my thousand welcomes home. For oft and oft I've stood, Delighted in the dew, Looking down across the wood, Where it stole into my viewâ Sweet spirit of the sod, Of our own Irish earth, Going gently up to God From the poor man's hearth. O, the blue, blue smoke Of my cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing, My thousand welcomes home. But I hurried swiftly on, When Herself from the door Came swimming like a swan Beside the Shannon shore; And after her in haste, On pretty, pattering feet, Our rosy cherubs raced Their daddy dear to meet; While the blue, blue smoke Of my cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing, Waved my thousand welcomes home. But the times are sorely changed Since those dim old days, And far, far I've ranged From those dear old ways; And my colleen's golden hair To silver all has grown, And our little cherub pair Have cherubs of their own; And the black, black smoke, Like a heavy funeral plume, Darkly wreathing, Fearful breathing, Crowns the city with its gloom. But 'tis our comfort sweet, Through the long toil of life, That we'll turn with tired feet From the noise and the strife, And wander slowly back In the soft western glow, Hand in hand by the track That we trod long ago; Till the blue, blue smoke Of our cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing, Waves our thousand welcomes home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RUSTIC POEMS. THE LIGHT IN THE SNOW. Oh Pat, the bitter day when you bravely parted from us, The mother and myself on the cruel quays of Cork: When you took the long kiss, and you gave the faithful promise That you'd soon bring us over to be wid you at New York. But the times they grew worse through the wild, weary winter, And my needle all we had to find livin' for us two; While the mother drooped and drooped till I knelt down forenint her And closed her dyin' eyes, dear,âbut still no word of you. Then the neighbours thought you false to me but I knew you better, Though the bud became the leaf, and the corn began to start; And the swallow she flew back, and still sorra letter, But I sewed on and on, Pat, and kep' a stout heart. Till the leaves they decayed, and the rook and the starlin' Returned to the stubble, and I'd put by enough To start at long last in search of my darlin' Alone across the ocean so unruly and rough. Until at the end, very weak and very weary, I reached the overside, and started on my search; But no account for ever of Patrick for his Mary, By advertisin' for you, dear, or callin' you in church. Yet still I struggled on, though my heart was almost broken And my feet torn entirely on the rough, rugged stone; Till that day it came round, signs by and by token, The day five year that we parted you, mavrone. Oh! the snow it was sweepin' through the dark, silent city, And the cruel wind it cut through my thin, tattered gown. Still I prayed the good God on his daughter to take pity; When a sudden, strange light shone forenint me up the town. And the light it led on till at last right oppossite A large, lonely house it vanished as I stood; Wid my heart axing wildly of me, was it, oh, was it A warnin' of ill or a token of good. When the light kindled up agin, brighter and bigger, And the shadow of a woman across the windy passed; While close, close, and closer to her stole a man's figure, And I fainted, as you caught me in your true arms at last. Then Pat, my own Pat, I saw that you were altered To the shadow of yourself by the fever on the brain! While âMary, Mary darlin',â at last your lips they faltered, âYou've given your poor Patrick his mem'ry back again.â And the good, gentle priest, when he comes, is never weary Of sayin', as he spakes of that light in the snow, âThe Lord heard your prayer, and in pity for you, Mary, Restored Pat the raison that he lost long ago.â WHAT IS LIFE WIDOUT A WIFE? FESTAL CHORUS. The Boys. What is life widout a wife? The Girls. 'Tis the bee widout his honey; 'Tis the hoard by misers stored; 'Tis the spendthrift's waste of money; Spring and all her song-birds mute; Summer wid no rosy flowers; Autumn robbed of all his fruit; Winterâand no fireside hours. The Girls. What is life widout a husband? The Boys. Poetry widout an iday; Powdther, and the shot forgot; Fishâand it foriver Friday; Musha! night widout a moon; Faix! and fever widout physic; Troth! and music out of tune; 'Dad! and dancin' widout music. The Girls. Then, give over playin' rover, Lads, wid Jacky-Lanthern Folly, Fondly turnin' to the burnin' Of Love's beacon bright and holy. The Boys. Now, girls, dear, whisper here! Where 'll we find his guidin' beacon. The Girls. In the skies of woman's eyes Fondly look, and one will waken. The Boys. Och! then you coquettes unthrue, To one lad at last be list'nin', Whilst your rose of beauty blowsâ Whilst like goold your hair is glist'nin', Yes! your charms into our arms Yield, whilst you can still be patrons, Or too late you'll mourn your fate, Poor ould maids among the matrons. THE HANDSOME WITCH. âHave I seen a witch, your honour? 'Deed I often have that same; But the worst was Morna Connor, Called âThe Handsome Witchâ by name. She was tall, no woman taller Ever cross'd your cur'ous sight, And to see her pass, you'd call her Higher nor her proper height: For though Time his constant quarrel Waged upon her cheek and lip; Though he stole their laughin' coral And destroyed their lovely clip; Though he robbed the sculptured roundness From her ivory neck and arm, Wasted up the soft profoundness Of her bosom's swellin' charm; Silvered her black head wid sprinkles Of his shinin' winter snow; Yes! and wrote his warnin' wrinkles On her bold, unbendin' browâ Time himself, that still unsparin' Bows the lordliest in the land, Could not curb the haughty bearin' Of that woman great and grand. No! nor thin one curlin' cluster Of her long, luxuriant hair: No! nor quinch the steady lustre Of her eyes' contimptuous stare. Many a cow wid swellin' udder, As the crafty crone went by, Took one cowld, unchristian shudder, Dad! and ran complately dry; While the witch she crossed the clover, Steadyin' on her skull wid care A full keeler frothin' over, As if milked from out the air. Many a colleen in the dairy Still should wave the churn-staff round, Scatterin' salt that crabbed fairy Wid her canthrips to confound: But in vain she'd thry for butter, Till she hadn't strength to stand; While through clear, enchanted water Morna drew the dead-man's hand. But I beg your honour's pardon, I'll conclude some other day; For the calf is in the garden, And the heifer 's at the hay.â SAVING THE TURF. Cuttin' the turf, cuttin' the turf, with our feet on the shinin' slan! Cuttin' the turf, cuttin' the turf, till the cows come home to the bawn! Footin' the turf, footin' the turf, footin' and turnin' our best, Footin' the turf, turnin' the turf, till the rook flies home to her nest! Settin' the turf, settin' the turf, hither and over the land, Settin' the turf, settin' the turf, till the say-turn sinks on the strand! Drawin' the turf, drawin' the turf, with our ponies and asses away, Drawin' the turf, drawin' the turf, till the boats are out in the bay! Rickin' the turf, rickin' the turf, safe in the haggard at last, To keep and to comfort us all from the rage of the rain and the blast. LOOBEEN. Bridgid. Ere the sun began to peep, Out I wandered through our orchard. Rosy. Since you couldn't quiet sleep, By the thoughts of Torlogh tortured; For 'tis rumoured how of late, By his manly beauty melted, With your pippen, plump and straight At the boy in vain you pelted.

Rosy. Yes! I've clever Phelim fast. Nora. Girls, go set the secret spreadin', That when solemn Lent is past We shall dance at Rosy's weddin'! THE BLACK '46. A RETROSPECT. Out away across the river, Where the purple mountains meet, There's as green a wood as iver, Fenced you from the flamin' heat. And oppÃ²site, up the mountain, Seven ancient cells ye'll see, And, below, a holy fountain Sheltered by a sacred tree; While between, across the tillage, Two boreens full up wid broom Draw ye down into a village All in ruin on the coom; For the most heart-breakin' story Of the fearful famine year On the silent wreck before ye You may read charÃ ctered clear. Yous are young, too young for ever To rec'llect the bitter blight, How it crep across the River Unbeknownst beneath the right; Till we woke up in the mornin', And beheld our country's curse Wave abroad its heavy warnin', Like the white plumes of a hearse. To our gardens, heavy-hearted, In that dreadful summer's dawn, Young and ould away we started Wid the basket and the slan. But the heart within the bosom Gave one leap of awful dread At each darlin' pratee blossom, White and purple, lyin' dead. Down we dug, but only scattered Poisoned spuds along the slope; Though each ridge in vain it flattered Our poor hearts' revivin' hope. But the desperate toil we'd double On into the evenin' shades; Till the earth to share our trouble Shook beneath our groanin' spades; Till a mist across the meadows From the graveyard rose and spread, And 'twas rumoured ghostly shadows, Phantoms of our fathers dead, Moved among us, wildly sharin' In the women's sobs and sighs, And our stony, still despairin', Till night covered up the skies. Thin we knew for bitter certain That the vinom-breathin' cloud, Closin' still its cruel curtain, Surely yet would be our shroud. And the fearful sights did folly, Och! no voice could rightly tell, But that constant, melancholy Murmur of the passin' bell; Till to toll it none among us Strong enough at last was found, And a silence overhung us Awfuller nor any sound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANGLO-IRISH BALLADS. GRAGALMACHREE. At the foot of Newry Mountain, to a stream in the wood One day I went fishing, and the take was so good That the very first moment my angle was out My hook it was fast in a fine plunging trout. But as down stream I stepped, with my soul full of sport, On a sudden I chanced on a charming resort: Where the beeches were bending in beautiful bowers O'er a velvet-green carpet embroidered with flowers. And from under that arbour, so cool and so deep, A colleen's voice chanted that made my heart leap, For the song that she sang was, âMy Lawrence, come hither, For upon my secret heart you 've put your comether.â I threw down my angle, and, in through the shade, Stole soft to the side of that young, blooming maid: O, she's slender in the waist and her face is fair to see, And her name in plain Irish is, Gragalmachree. For her tears and her sobs she scarcely could say, âAh, Lawrence! ah, Lawrence! what carried you this way To overhear the secret long lodged in my breast, And leave me for ever disgraced and distressed?â Now, comfort you, comfort you, Gragalmachree, For that little, sweet song was Heaven's music to me, And God's blessing for ever attend on the thought That took me fishing trout, till I found myself caught. And the moon she may darken and the stars lose their light: And the green plains of Erin they may blacken with blight, And her mountains all melt in the middle of the sea, If I ever prove false to my Gragalmachree. MY BONNY CUCKOO. My bonny cuckoo, come whisper true! Around the world I'd rove with you; I'd rove with you until the next spring, And still my cuckoo would sweetly sing,â âCuckoo! cuckoo!â until the next spring; âCuckoo! cuckoo!â until the next spring. The ash and the hazel shall mourning say,â âOh, merry cuckoo, don't fly away! The winter wind is rude and keen; Oh, cuckoo, stay and keep us green! Cuckoo! cuckoo! oh stay! oh stay! And make the season for ever May!â The thrush and the robin shall sadly cry,â âOur bonny cuckoo, oh, do not fly! For when you spread your speckled wing We have no longer heart to sing. Cuckoo, cuckoo, still lead our tune, And make the season for ever June!â The lads and the lasses together stand, And call their cuckoo from off the strand,â âHow can you leave us, bird of love, With the green below and the blue above? Oh no! oh no! you shall not go, With the blue above and the green below.â THE WILLOW TREE. Oh, take me to your arms, love, for we alas must part; Oh, take me to your arms, love, for the pain is at my heart. She hears not, she cares not, but coldly keeps from me, While here I lie, alone to die, beneath the willow tree. My love has blooming beauty, my cheek is deadly wan; My love has countless riches, my gallant fortune's gone. This ribbon fair, that bound her hair, is all that's left to me, While here I lie, alone to die, beneath the willow tree. I once had gold and silver I thought would never end: I once had gold and silver, and I thought I had a friend: My wealth is sped, my friend has fled and stolen my love from me; While here I lie, alone to die, beneath the willow tree. JENNY. With laughing looks I once arose, How dark soe'er the day; Now sadly every sunburst shows, For joy has fled away, Jenny; For joy has fled away! Nor flocks nor herds nor store of gold, Nor broad estate have I; If beauty must be bought and sold, Alas! I cannot buy, Jenny; Alas! I cannot buy. Yet I'll be rich, if you'll be kind, And once again agree To bear me still in loving mind Till I've a home for thee, Jenny; A home till death for thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FROM THE CELTIC. BELTANE. Oh, mild May day, in F?dla's clime Of fairy colour, the laughing prime Of leafy summer from year to year, I would that Leagha were with me here To lie and listen down in a dell To Banba's blackbirds warbling well, And her cuckoos crying with constant strain Welcome, welcome the bright Beltane; When the swallows are skimming the shore, And the swift steed stoops to the fountain, And the weak, fair bog-down grows on the moor, And the heath spreads her hair on the mountain, And the signs of heaven are in consternation, And the rushing planets such radiance pour, That the sea lies lulled, and the generation Of flowers awakes once more. PATRICK AND OISIN. âOisin, Oisin, too long is thy slumber. Oisin, arise, and give ear to the chant: Thy force hath forsook thee, thy battles are over, And without us, old man, thou would'st perish of want.â âMy force hath forsook me, my battles are over; Since alas the famed empire of Finn is no more, And without you indeed 'tis for want I should perish, But since Finn sweetest music is music no more.â âNay, silly old man, for all of thy vaunting, Of the loud Dord-Finn chorus, the timpan and horn, Thou hast never heard music like matin bells ringing, Or solemn psalms sung in the still summer morn.â âThough greatly thou praisest the chants of the clerics, I had rather lie listening down in the dale To the voice of the cuckoo of Letter Lee calling; Or the very sweet thrushes of green Gleann-a-Sgail; âOr the song of the blackbird of Derrycarn gushing So full and so free in the woods of the West; (Oh, Patrick, no hymn under heaven could approach it! Ah, would that I only were under his nest!) âAnd I'd far liefer hearken the eagle's fierce whistle, From lone Glennamoo or the Ridge by the stream, Or list the loud thunder of rushing Tra-Rury, Or catch on rough Irrus the seagull's scream. âAnd I'd bid long goodbye to the bells of the clerics, Could I once again follow o'er mountain and moor The tune of the twelve fleetest wolf hounds of Erin Let loose with their faces away from the Suir. âAnd Cnu, little Cnu of my bosom, where art thou? O small fairy dwarf, to the Finians so dear, Whose harp ever soothed all our sorrows to slumber, Ah, Cnu, little Cnu, how I would you were here. âWhere is now your betrothed one, oh, Cnu, where is Blathnaid, Who stood up in beauty to sing when you played; For the mouth of no mortal such sweetness could utter, As the soft, rosy mouth of that magical maid.â THE SONG OF THE FAIRY KING. Queen of women, oh come away, Come to my kingdom strange to see; Where tresses flow with a golden glow, And white as snow is the fair bod?. Under the arching of ebon brows, Eyes of azure the soul enthral, And a speech of songs to the mouth belongs, And sorrowful sighing shall ne'er befall. Bright are the blooms of Innisfail, Green her forests wave in the west: But brighter flowers and greener bowers Shall all be ours in that country blest. Can her streams compare to the runnels rare Of yellow honey and rosy wine That softly slip to the longing lip With magic flow through that land of mine? We roam the earth in its grief and mirth, But move unseen of all therein, For before their gaze there hangs a haze, The heavy haze of their mortal sin. But our age wastes not, our beauty tastes not Evil's apple nor droops nor dies; Death slays us never, but love for ever With stainless ardour illumes our eyes. Then, queen of women, oh come away, Come and sit on my fairy throne, In a realm of rest with spirits blest, Where sin and sorrow are all unknown. O'CURNAN'S SONG. O Mary bhan asthore, That through my bosom's core Hast pierced me past the Isle of Fodla's healing; By Heaven, 'tis my belief, Had you but known my grief, Long since to me with succour you'd been stealing. With tears the night I waste; No food by day I taste, But wander weak and silent as a shadow! Ah! if I may not find My Mary true and kind, My mother soon must weep, a sonless widow. I know not night from day: âCuckoo!â the thrushes say! But how can it be May in dark December? My friends look strange and wild; But hasten, Mary mild, And well my heart its mistress shall remember. No herb or skill of hand My cure can now command, From you, O Flower of Love, alone I'll seek it; Then hasten, hasten here, My own and only dear, And in your secret ear I'll softly speak it. One sweet kiss from your mouth Would quench my burning drouth, And lift me back to life; ah! yield it to me; Or make for me my bed Among the mouldering dead, Where the winding worms may crawl and channel through me. Ah! better buried so Than like a ghost to go, All music, dance, and sport with sighs forsaking; A witless, wandering man For the love of Mary bhan, With the heart within my bosom slowly breaking. CAOINE. Cold, dark, and dumb lies my boy on his bed; Cold, dark, and silent the night dews are shed; Hot, swift, and fierce fall my tears for the dead! His footprints lay light in the dew of the dawn As the straight, slender track of the young mountain fawn; But I'll ne'er again follow them over the lawn. His manly cheek blushed with the sun's rising ray, And he shone in his strength like the sun at midday; But a cloud of black darkness has hid him away. And that black cloud for ever shall cling to the skies: And never, ah, never, I'll see him arise, Lost warmth of my bosom, lost light of my eyes!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS AND SKETCHES. SONG. Some go smiling through the grey time. Under naked, songless bowers: Some go mourning all the May time, 'Mid the laughing leaves and flowers. Why is this, Rosy Bliss Comes to kiss Winter grey? Why, ah! why Doth Sorrow sigh On the lap of lovely May? Happy Love, with song and smiling, Through the withered woodland goes: Hapless Love hath no beguiling From the redbreast or the rose. This is why Woods may sigh, Flowers die and hearts be gay: This, alas! The piteous pass That leaves us mourning all the May. FROM THE RED ROSE. From the red rose to the apple-blossom, From the apple-blossom to the blue sky, Looking up still in the spring-tide, When none else is by, For a love born On a May morn, Long, long ago, I sigh. From the blue sky to the apple-blossom, And the roses in row, Looking down still in the spring-tide, Through my garden I go, For a love lost In a spring frost, Singing Heigh ho, heigh ho! O BRANCH OF FRAGRANT BLOSSOM. O Branch of fragrant blossom, How the heart in my bosom Lay heaving before you with hopeless sigh; Till your voice grew low and tender, And a soft, love-lit splendour Shone out to save me from your dark, dreamy eye. O branch of rosy blossom, Radiant bride of my bosom, My heart heaves no longer with hopeless sigh; For you 're the blessed shadow Upon my burning meadow, My sunshine in winter, and my love till I die. ONE LOVING SMILE. O, white and red, Above your head The arbutus flowers and berries grow; And underneath The blushing heath I've found for luck the heath of snow; And sure 'tis fine The foamy line That laughs across the purple bay; But, ah, let slip From your ripe lip One loving smile, and where are they? SNOW DRIFT. Sigh on, sad wind, O'er hill and forest, With thee my spirit Would fain go forth: Thus unconfined, When grief was sorest, I should inherit The dreary north. With thee I'd sail On viewless pinion O'er snowy spaces Where man is not; And all things wail The frost's dominion, And summer's graces Are all forgot. For my great grief, All solace scorning, Abhors the heaven She's left a hell: O'er flower and leaf, The purple morning, The golden even, She spreads a spell. Till human speech Seems false and hollowâ In man and woman God's image lost. Then I beseech That I may follow To haunts inhuman Of snow and frost. More true and chaste, Thou bitter Norland, Than southern languor, Hot-blooded jars; Thy wintry waste, Thy solemn foreland, Aurora's anger Amongst the stars. Sigh on, sad wind, O'er hill and forest, With thee my spirit Would fain go forth; Thus unconfined, When grief was sorest, I should inherit The dreary north. SHAMROCK LEAVES. Oh! if for every tear That from our exiled eyes Has fallen, Erin dear, A shamrock could arise, We'd weave a garland green Should stretch the ocean through, All, all the way between Our aching hearts and you! SNOW STAINS. The snow had fallen, and fallen from heaven, Unnoticed in the night, As o'er the sleeping sons of God Floated the manna white; And still though small flowers crystalline Blanched all the earth beneath, Angels with busy hands above Renewed the airy wreath; When, white amid the falling flakes, And fairer far than they, Beside her wintry casement hoar A dying woman lay. âMore pure than yonder virgin snow From God comes gently down I left my happy country home,â She sighed, âto seek the town. More foul than yonder drift shall turn, Before the sun is high, Down-trodden and defiled of men, More foul,â she wept, âam I. Yet, as in midday might confessed, Thy good sun's face of fire Draws the chaste spirit of the snow To meet him from the mire, Lord, from this leprous life in death Lift me, Thy Magdalene, That rapt into Redeeming Light I may once more be clean.â A SONG OF THE SEASONS. Oh! the Spring's delight Is the cowslip bright, As she laughs to the warbling linnet, And a whistling thrush On a white May bush, And his mate on her nest within it. Summer she shows Her rose, her rose! And oh! all the happy night long The nightingale woos her; At dawn the lark sues her, With the crystal surprise of his song. King Autumn's crown Is the barley brown, Red over with rosy fruit; And the yellow trees, As they sigh in the breeze, Are the strings of his solemn lute. Old Winter's breath Is cold as death, 'Tis lonesome he's left the earth; Yet the thrush he sings, And the rose she springs From the flame of his fairy hearth. MAUREEN. Blue eyes 'mid ebon lashes lost, Gold hair o'er silver shoulders tossed, Lips crimson coral ivory-crossedâ Maureen! To-day to confidence beguiled; To-morrow haughty, wayward, wild; A woman half and half a childâ Maureen. SPRING'S SECRETS. As once I paused on poet wing In the green heart of a grove, I met the Spirit of the Spring, With her great eyes lit of Love. She took me gently by the hand, And whispered in my anxious ear Secrets none may understand, Till she make their meaning clear: âWhy the primrose looks so pale; Why the rose is set with thorns; Why the magic nightingale Through the darkness mourns and mourns.â She ceased: a leafy murmur sighed Softly through the listening trees. Anon she uttered, eager-eyed, These her joyful mysteries: âHow the angels, as they pass With their vesture pure and white O'er the shadowy garden grass, Touch the lilies into light: âOr with hidden hands of love Guide the throstle's wavering wings, But show their faces bright above, Only where the skylark sings.â THE REJECTED LOVER. On Innisfallen's fairy isle, Amid the blooming bushes, We leant upon the lover's stile, And listened to the thrushes; When first I sighed to see her smile, And smiled to see her blushes. Her hair was bright as beaten gold, And soft as spider's spinning; Her cheek out-bloomed the apple old That set our parents sinning; And in her eyes you might behold My joys and griefs beginning. In Innisfallen's fairy grove I hushed my happy wooing, To listen to the brooding dove Amid the branches cooing; But oh! how short those hours of love, How long their bitter rueing! Poor cushat thy complaining breast With woe like mine is heaving; With thee I mourn a fruitless quest, For ah! with art deceiving, The cuckoo-bird has robbed my nest, And left me wildly grieving. THE BEAUTIFUL BAY. A CADENCE OF KENMARE RIVER. I lifted mine eyes and beheld him lying, that Harper old, on the green sea-grass, And I said in my heart, âI will rise and seek a lonelier spot, O mother dear; For this thy sea and these thy woods, and those thy violet hills and vales, At the coming of others, estrange from my soul all their low, sweet communings.â So I arose. Now he spake no word, but he glanced a glance, and his spirit met mine, And swifter than speech, and surer far, thus he answered my secret thought. âAvoid not! I hush not her rich revealings, for I am hers, aye, even as thou; Avoid not, for surely she drew us together, her dearest children, for only this,â To breathe to us both some tenderer tidings than ever she whispered each soul apart.â I looked in his face, and I believed the eloquent blue of the old man's eye, And I knew, by the ruddy rose of his cheek, and the full, white flower of his flowing hair, A son, indeed, of Nature's love. I looked, and I loved him for her sake, And returned again to my seat in silence, and side by side on the soft sea-grass, With the bluest blue of heaven above us, we sat at gaze on the Beautiful Bay. Gazing, gazing, oh delight! for the sea-turn blew from the ocean beyond, And ever before his full, sweet voice the Arbutus Islands, for utter joy, Shivered in every sparkling leaf, and called, âHe comes!â to the wooing waves. And these leaped back with a silver laugh, and cried it to all of their crystal clan, And the white smile spread, and hither and thither, with dark, swift fingers pointed to shore The wind-flaws darted o'er the dreaming azure, and the ripples danced after in a diamond dance, And nearer and nearer the rapture ran, till the cool air kissed on the craving cheek. O breathing balm! O sweet sea-spice! O wind of the west, that most I love! Now the Sea had risen, and wrestled and lost and wrestled and won with the struggling Shore For the golden spoils they win and lose with the Moon above for arbitress; Till only one thin, red torque remained for Ocean's triumphant conquesting. Then the sea-turn fluttered with fainting wings, fluttered, fluttered, failed, and fell; And the Sun strode down from mountain to mountain, kissing their foreheads with his farewell kiss To a happy rose that flushed through heaven, and thrilled and trembled out of sight. Then the sweet night fell, and the soft stars shone, and we sang, âGood night!â to the Beautiful Bay. AMBROSE AND UNA. It was the good Sir Ambrose Came spurring to the sea, And to woo the beauteous Una From his castle high rode he. They plighted their troth together, And sealed it with seals of gold, But a month and a day thereafter The good knight slept in the mould. Now, alas! for the Lady Una, She made such bitter moan That the dead Sir Ambrose heard her From his grave in the churchyard lone. Up rose the dead Sir Ambrose, All in his shroud of white, And to his true love's bower Stole softly through the night. He tapped at his true love's bower, With his hand so long and thin; âI pray thee, dearest Una, Let thy loving bridegroom in.â But his dear lady answered, âI cannot ope the door Till Jesu's name thou namest, As thou wast wont before.â âRise, oh! rise, dear Una, Nor fear to unbar the door; I can name the blessed Jesu As I was wont before.â Up rose the weeping Una, And her bower opened wide, And the dead Sir Ambrose entered And sat by her bedside. With her golden comb his true love Combed out his tresses dear, And each fair lock, as she kissed it, She bathed with the bitter tear. And âOh! tell me, dearest Ambrose, By thy Una's love,â she said, âHow fares it since they laid thee In thy dark and lonesome bed?â âWhenever thy sorrow, Una, Is soothed in sacred prayer, Forthwith my gloomy coffin Is filled with roses fair. âBut whenever, oh! my Una, Thy grief is wild and loud, Those soft and fragrant roses Turn to tears upon my shroud. âDost hear the red cock crowing? I must no longer stay; 'Tis the hour the churchyard claims us, The sad hour before the day.â So the good Sir Ambrose turned him, Deep sighing from the door, And to the lonely churchyard Went silently once more. But Una followed after, And clasped her true love's hand, And forth they fared together To the dark and dreadful land. They could not speak for sorrow; The grave too soon was nigh; And Sir Ambrose' fair hair faded As flames to ashes die. Till, as they stood together, Where the dead man's tomb was made, Whilst his cheeks grew wan and hollow, Sir Ambrose faintly said: âLook up to the sky, my Una, For my moments swiftly fail; Look up and tell me truly Is this the dawning pale?â She turned her sad face from him Toward the coming light, When straight the good Sir Ambrose Softly melted from her sight. To her bower went poor Una, And prayed to Jesu blest, That ere the year was over She, too, might be at rest. But the month and the day thereafter Upon her bier she lay, And now, with good Sir Ambrose, Awaits the Judgment Day. ORPHEUS TO PLUTO. Oh Thou, whom alone of Immortals But to name is a fear among men, Through the gloom of whose terrible portals Is no turning again, When, ghost after ghost, to thy regions Unlovely to flee we are fain, As the wild winter-swans flock in legions Remote o'er the main! I come not with insult Titanic To thy consort Tityosas came, Whom to Lust, a perpetual panic, Thy retributive flame At her feet laid immense in his anguish; Nor clothed on with Herakles' might, Am I here thy Three-headed to vanquish, Dread Monarch of Night! I, alas, am that Orpheus ill-fortuned, Who with song, in his pleasant youth flown, Wooed flowers from waste places, importuned Clear streams from the stone; And with magic maturer united Man to man in the graces of art, Till Eros drew bow, and delighted Two souls with his smart. Spring sisterly smiled on my wooing, Summer motherly welcomed my wife; But a foe, Autumn entered, subduing All sweetness of life. For alas, like a pure lily-blossom Transfixed by the brier of the brake, She has fallen, the bride of my bosom, A spoil to the snakeâ Evil beast, that for slaughter lay slunken Subtle-eyed at the shadowy ford, What time, scarce escaped from the drunken Unchaste Honey-Lord, Up the slope of the Hebrus she hurried, Witless quite of a new foe beneath, Till his fangs in her fair flesh he buriedâ The darter of Death. Grief-distraught by her side on the morrow, With rent raiment and locks dust-defiled, Low I lay, till there stole on my sorrow The voice of a child. âTake comfort, sad son of Apollo! Arise, nothing fearing, and lay Thy hand to thy lute-strings, and follow, For Love leads the way.â From the corse my despairful clasp sunders; Hope-flushed the dear harp I invade; Earth shakes at the sound, the air thunders, And the deeps are dismayed. Yea! the Day Sire above thee, thy brother, Tellus old, and the Lord of the Main, Weird laughter with strange sighings smother, Mirth with moanings of pain; Whilst a God to thine awful dominion Greatly guided my feet from above, The All-wise, All-pervasive-of-pinion, Omnipotent Love! On we fared! Orcus opened to list us! On we fared! Death herself dropped a tear! Charon, Cerberus, may not resist us, And unharmed we are here. Now, O King, for the cause of our mission Thou hast heard; knowing also the worth Of the lost one, at Love's own petition Redeem her to earth!â Love, who steered thy black steeds to the meadows Of Enna, and won thee the bride, Who now queens it o'er congregate shadows, Enthroned at thy side!â Love, the ally, through whom thou prolongest Bliss supreme in these joyless abodes! Love! Love! still the weakest, the strongest, Eldest, youngest of Gods! SONG: TO E. P. When our little Queen was born, Winter first with furious pother Flew to fix his icy scorn On the infant and the mother. But in such a loving fashion Side by side he found them laid, That to pity all his passion Melting quite, he softly said: âChild and mother sleep unharmed! See how vanquished by your beauty Winter's dreadful self disarmed Kneels to do you dearest duty.â Then a courser blast bestriding, Winter waved his wild adieu, And the gentle spring came guiding To the couch her zephyrs blue. Leaning there, the imperial maid, From the crystal car that bore her, Lightly her flower-sceptre laid On the lovely babe before her, Whisp'ring, âSince thy wiles have driven Winter from my budding bowers, Every grace I e'er have given, Mortal maiden, shall be yours. âSee! I touch with violets two Lisa's lids, in token tender Of the eyes of modest blue That shall most enchantment lend her. âNext I lay these mountain daisies, Clustering close with crimson tips Round their petals' pearly graces, For a sign on Lisa's lips. âNow her tiny cheek I tint With this trailing apple blossom, And these snowdrops for a hint Drop into her dainty bosom. âLast for Lisa's heart this pansy!â Here she stooped and whispering spoke, Ere she sped, so fond a fancy That our Lisa smiling woke. CHOOSING A PROFESSION. âWhen Robin's a big man, what will wee Robin be?â So he peeped, half afraid, From the cozy little nest that in mother's gown he'd made, Our plump, rosy Robin, he peeped out and said: âA sailor I will be, To sail upon the sea, But papa and mamma, won't you sail along with me?â âNo! the captain of the ship wouldn't let mamma sail, He'd only take me.â âThen oh! what a cruel man the captain must be, Not to take my dear mamma to sail upon the sea. So, papa, I'll be instead, A soldier all in red, With a sword in my hand and a helmet on my headâ âAnd I'll fight, fight, fight, for papa and for mamma.â âBut if you were killed?â âThen I'd fly Far away above the clouds O, so, so high, Till I came to our Father on his throne in the sky, And ask to be instead Of a soldier all in red, An angel all in white to keep watch beside your bed.â MYRTILLA. Myrtilla boasts a marble brow By ebon tresses softly swept, Myrtilla's mouth is Cupid's bow In rosy nectar newly dipped, And heaven's own azure lights her eyes, Her cheek bids roses blush in vain; Say, shall the lovely nymph surprise This bosom with her conquering chain? Nay, I mistrust the studied skill That twines her tresses' silken snare; The honied sigh her lips distil Is heaved with too consummate care; Her eyes, with all too amorous art, Now shun, and now upon me shine; Too well thou hast rehearsed thy part, Myrtilla, ever to be mine! LOVE'S SURPRISE. He sang as he lay on Mangerton mountain, That Irish knight who had never known love, âWhat song so sweet as the chiming fountain? What blue so blue as the heaven above?â Fond heart! for nearer and nearer drew A sweeter voice and an eye more blue. âO what can blush by the purple heather? What gold with the gorse-flower dare compare?â He turned, fond heart, and found them together, On her glowing cheek and her glittering hair. Now what for the knight are the hill-flower's dyes, The fountain's voice and the sapphire skies? She had lost her path, that lovely lady, Whose heart had never a lord confessed; O bright she blushed, and gently prayed he Would guide her over the mountain crest; And little loth was the gallant knight To squire the steps of that lady bright. So he took her hand, and they passed together, The knight and the lady unlearned of love, Through the golden gorse and the purple heatherâ O laughingly beamed the blue above, And the fountain sang as their feet went by, The sibyl fountain, âFor aye, for aye.â AMÅBÃAN. He. The sky has lost the happy lustre It borrowed from her azure eyes, The unruly winds around me bluster, Unsoftened by her balmy sighs, And for my true love's loss alone The thronging town 's a desert grown. She. Along the glen and o'er the heather, With spring's return once more I stray Through scenes where oft we've roved together At rosy dawn and gloaming grey; But all these former haunts of bliss, Love, without thee their beauty miss! He. By arch triumphal, lordly tower, With thoughts like these I soothe my wayâ âWhat sculptured flower could match her bower With wreaths of living roses gay? And piles superb, and courtly hall, For her sweet cot I'd change you all.â She. Now blooms each freshest, fairest blossom, By woodland wild and garden wall, Yet pressed unto this aching bosom, These faint blue stars are worth them all. For being too sad to speak the thought, With these he sighed, âForget me not.â He. In art supreme, around us, o'er us, Sweet Southern voices rise and float, Or swells sublime the lofty chorus, Or dies on one voluptuous noteâ But how can mimic transports move, After her unfeigned words of love? She. Let skylarks spring to meet the morrow With lays of jubilant delight, And Philomela's voice of sorrow Most passionate plead the livelong night: If of sweet music I have choice, Waft me one echo of his voice. He. Oh! what are city pomp and pride, If Celia be not by my side? She. Oh! would that I my way might win To that sweet town he sojourns in! LOVE'S SONG. Love is a boundless bliss: All they who share it With lover's look and lover's kiss, Surely shall declare it. Love is a precious pain: No skill can heal it, When they who sigh but sigh in vain In their hearts conceal it. Love with the crown of life His king and queen covers, When gallant man and gentle wife Still are steadfast lovers. Ah! and when envious Death One life shall smother, Love with his willow-wreath Crowns that constant other. Young men and maids, for love Seek, till ye find it, And having found, win Heaven above About your hearts to bind it. COMPANIONS. Smile farewell to Sorrow: Give to Joy good-morrow: And charge him to continue A quiet reign within you. Smile farewell to Gladness, Take the hand of Sadness, And wistfully beseech her To be your tender teacher. So shall both befriend you, And to the grave attend you; There Sorrow from you sever, Joy go with you ever. GOOD NIGHT. Good night! good night! our feast is ended, By young and old with smiles attended; Where Wit and Worth and Beauty blended, To speed the hours with dance and song. Beauty's smile Free from guile, Wit that shone Wounding none: And manly Worth and Woman true, Good night! and joy go home with you. Good night! and may your minstrel's numbers Still echo on amid your slumbers, To spell-bind every care that cumbers The lover's heart, the mother's breast. Beauty, Mirth, Wit and Worth Fall to sleep Calm and deep, Nor rouse, till rosy Morrow call, âAwake, and joy go with you all!â</field>
