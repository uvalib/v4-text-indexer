      <field name="fulltext">August Lib. 1. de anima. Eloquentia in homine pravo, est Venenum in peculo aureo. To the Right Honourable Sir T.P. L.M.L. Thrice Worthy Sir, accept this Sheet, Which Flies with Wings, instead of Feet, That it may rest, and safely lie Under the Sun-shine of your Eye. It is a Fight, 'twixt Word and Wind, For Justice as we oft-times find; One's Right perverted in pretence; By false informing Eloquence. 'Tis short enough, then read it o're, And for my Mite, I ask no more; But wish all Controversy Dye, Without reviv'd Logomachy. P. K. THE Conquest of Eloquence In Two Witty Orations. The Argument. Achilles being slain by Paris, at the Siege of Troy, by an Arrow in the Heel; (where only he was Vulnerable;) there arose a great Controversie betwixt Ajax and Ulisses, for his Armour. But Agamemnon, (to whom they had submitted their Cause,) not able (tho willing) to satisfie both, appointed them to debate the Controversie, and plead their Cause, before the Nobles of Greece, there present; which they did: Ajax first pleading his Right, upon the Account of Kindred, great Exploits, and Service done in the Græcian War; throwing Disgraceful Aspersions on Ulisses; which Ulisses (being both Witty and Eloquent) did Answer, and seem to clear himself of, to Ajax's Shame and Disgrace; and so obtain'd the Arms; whereat Ajax (being incensed) slew himself, (as it is reported,) tho it be the Opinion of most Men, that Ulisses hired Two Fellows to kill him Cowardly. The Officers sat on the Ground, The common Souldiers standing round; Up-started Ajax brisk and bold, Who bore the Buckler Seven-fold: And being furious (with a Face O'respread with Frowns in every place) He with a stubborn look did stare On Sygæum, and the Navy there. And bending forth his Hands did say, Good Jove! and all that's here to day! Is't come to this? Must I contest, With such a Rascal, who's the best? In view of these our Ships, and see Ulisses in the Scales with me? He did not stick his Britch to turn, And run when Hector strove to burn Them into Ashes, but that I Sustain'd the brunt, and forc'd him fly. But 'tis more safe to scold with Words, Than cuff with Fists, and fight with Swords. My very Tongue is at a stand; But he hath neither Heart nor Hand: Yet whatsoe're I'm worth in Battle, He countervails it, with his prattle. But here I think it were in vain To mention my Exploits again, Which I perform'd before your Eyes, (O Greeks) on every Enterprize. But let Ulisses tell his own, Which are to all (but Night) unknown. The Prize is great for which we sue, And I submit my Cause to you: But it my Honour stains, to see A Coward thus compeat with me. Nor is't Ambition to obtain A Thing Ulisses thought to gain, Though cast, he'll steal the spoil away, Of our Logomachy to Day. He'll brag he strove (as well he can) With Ajax for the better Man. And if my Valour were in doubt, My Pedegree could bear me out: For Noble Birth I'll yield to none, As being Son to Telamon; Who under Hercules did make, The stately Walls of Troy to shake; And, with a flying pair of Oars, Arrived safe on Colchi's Shores. Now Eacus his Father was, Who Sentence on the Dead doth pass. Where Sisyphus doth rowl (in vain) A Stone which tumbleth back again. And Jupiter (it is well known) Did Eacus for his Son own. Thus I'm (though ballenc'd with this Elf) But Three Degrees from Jove himself. And let my reckoning thus (I pray) Avail me nothing here to day; If brave Achilles did not own What I before you (Greeks) have shown. He was my Brother, I pursue For no more than's a Brother's due: Thou Brood of Sisyphus, like him, In Theft and Fraud, of whom thou'rt come; How dar'st thou have the brazen Face, (That's Stranger to Achille's Race, And Country too) thus be so rude, As on my Interest to intrude? Is it because my worth is such As never was put to the touch; But without grudge at first did come, At the first Call, and beat of Drum; And Arms did take, that these should be Unjustly now kept back from me? And shall he who did take Arms last Be, therefore, now reputed best, Who did at first the War but scoff, And with feign'd Madness shift it off; Till Palamed (more wise than he) Found out the Coward's Fallacy, And did (tho to his loss and pain) Even force him to his Arms again. Now let him take (whate'er befal) The best, who would have none at all. Let us be slighted, frustrat too Of Cousin's, Goods, which must be due; Since we at first, without all fear, Sustain'd the dangers of the War. I wish he had been real mad, Or still reputed so, then had Not my Companion (who exhorts To Baseness) seen the Phrygian Forts: Neither had Philoctetes thou Expos'd been unto Lemnos now; Where thou, in vain, dost waste thy time, By our Persuasions, made thy Crime; Block'd up in Caves, where thy sad Groans, The Rocks, and Ecchoing Hills bemoanes; Wishing Ulisses may inherit The just Reward which he doth merit. I Pray the Gods (if Gods they be) May thy Petition grant to thee. Alas our Fellow Souldier sworn To Grecian Colour, by us born, Who by Succession useth now Alcide's Shafts, and Quiver too; Being hunger-starv'd, and broke with pain, Doth Hunt and Fowl, that he may gain His Living, with the Darts and Bow, Which do portend Troy's overthrow. And yet he lives a sorry Life, Freed from Ulysse's fraud and strife. Now I could wish, at any rate, This had been Palamede's Fate: For whether he had liv'd or not, He had not left us such a blot; For that base Knave kept in his mind, How he's feign'd Madness out did find: And falsly, in revenge, did say, That he the Grecians did betray, For Gold, which in his Tent he shew; Though Palamedes nothing knew Thereof; for that Son of a Whore Had digg'd it there, a while before. Thus he by Banishment, or Death, His aid to Grecians doth bequeath. This way to fight he's only able, Thus is Ulysses formidable: For though he, with a York-Shire-ho, Could honest Nestor overthrow; Yet in deserting that Old Man, Without Relief, he never can (For all that he can prate and say) With Wind bals wipe the stain away. For why the poor decripid Sot, (Whose Horse could neither Jog nor Trot) Implor'd Ulisses for supply; But like a Coward he did fly, And sneak away, just like a Thief, Leaving his Friend, without Relief. Think not I brand him with a lie, Tydides can this Testifie; Who did upbraid, and call again The Coward, but it was in vain. But Justice freely did design To pay the Coward in his coin. He wanted help, who would give none; As he did leave, he's left alone. He made the Law, when he did call His Fellow Souldiers; none at all Did pity him, till only I Did see the Coward trembling lie: His Face for fear, was pale and white, And fear of Death had made him S? I, covering him, did interpose My Target, 'twixt him and his Foes. I brag not, tho you plainly see, The Coward holds his Life of me. But if thou dar'st thus to contest, Which of us two in War is best; Let us return into the Field, And see which of us two will yield. Call back our Foes, mind how I found Thee Speechless, groveling on the ground. Think on thy Wound, thy cowardly mind; Then Fight, or rather lurk behind Thy Target; that these Greeks may see The most deserving, thee or me. But mind, he who could hardly stand (Disabl'd more in Heart than Hand) As soon as I did set him free, Did instantly begin to flee, And run (for nothing did him ail) As twenty had been at his Tail. Then furious Hector, in a fry, Came, in the twinkling of an eye, Thinking to be without resistance, Brought Jove along for his assistance: And wheresoe'er he rushing ran, He frightned every valiant Man: Not only 'Lysse's cowardly mind, (Whose Valour but consists in Wind.) Till I, whilst he did brag and boast, Of his Massacring our Host; Did with a Stone (which did rebound) Quite knock him down upon the ground. Thus I, o'rcame, with much to do, Both Jupiter and Hector too. And when he, challenging, did boast, That we had not, in all our Host, A Champion, who could take his Arms, And deal with him in equal terms; I took him up, whilst you did pray For me the triumph of the day. And if you farther please to pry In what was done, I did not fly. Consider how the Trojans brought Both Fire and Sword, with Jove, and thought To burn our Fleet, and kill our Men, (But where was Mouth-Ulisses then?) This Breast of mine did harmless save A thousand Ships, for which I crave These Arms here, my reward to be, For all the Navy due to me. Had they by Hector all been burn'd, By what means could we have return'd? If I be free to speak my mind, But weigh the matter, and you'll find, By my obtaining my demand, (Which Justice cannot well withstand) Unto the Arms (as all may see) More Honour doth redound than me: Yea, Credit both and Honour too, It contributes to them and you. Thus Ajax begs no Arms, but they For me Pettion, beg and pray. Let Ithacus compare with these. His Deeds of all-deserving praise, How he did Rhesu's Plots prevent, And kill'd him cowardly in his Tent. And silly Dolon overthrew, When he our Camp came but to view: And Priam's Helenus did slay; And Palla's Image stole away. All his Exploits are done at night, The Sun scarce ever saw him fight. No success he or fortune had, But when he went with Diomed. Now if such simple Acts of Praise (For hire) deserve such Arms as these, Let them devided be in two; For most to Diomede is due. But tell me pray, on what Account Can base Ulysse's deeds amount, To such deserts? Who slily goes, Thief-like unarm'd, to trap his Foes. The glistering Helmet, bright like Gold Will his trapanning slight unfold; And he'll be catched in the Snare, Which he for others doth prepare. Achille's Head-peice will weigh down Ulysse's round Dulichian Crown: His feeble Arms will neither bear, Nor weild the great Achille's Spear. The stately Shield, which represents The little World, in Linaments, To Hang will certainly repine, On such a Thevish Arm as thine. Poor simple Fellow, dost thou know That thou beg'st thine own overthrow? For if the Errour of the Greeks, Should grant thee this which now thou seeks, It would give no offence at all Unto thy Foes; but work thy fall. The Trailing Logage in the Night, Will make thee lazie in thy flight: The only means that Coward thou Dost use the Trojans to subdue. And, furthermore, thou hast a Shield That's whole, and searce e'er fac'd the Field. But mine (as all my Hearers knows) Is sadly damnifi'd with blows. In equal terms it oft pursu'd Our Foes, and now would be renew'd. These Words but new Contention breeds, Pray let us have a touch at Deeds: Take brave Achille's Arms, and fling them Among our Foes, and see who'll bring them. Here Ajax ends, and all the rout Of Souldiers that did stand about With his last Words a Tumult raise, Sounding his Merits, and his Praise; Till worthy Ithacus arose, Their rustick Rashness to oppose; And pausing (with a gentle smile) He fix'd his Eyes on Earth a while, Then lifting up his Face with Care, He to the Noble Grecians there, Thus bravely spoke, in his Defence, With Grace, and fluent Eloquence. Ulysses's Oration. Greeks had your Pray'rs prevail'd with mine, (In reference to this design) There had been no great cause to fear In this Debate, the Lawful Heir. We with Achilles had been blest, And he his Armour still possest. (With this the Counterfeit did Cry, And seem to Wipe a Watery Eye) But since the Rigid Fates denies To us, Poor Mortals, such a prize; Who with more right his Armour seeks Than he who brought him to the Greeks? Now as for Ajax let it not Avail him that he is a Sot; Nor slight my Wit, which he doth take To be a Vice, and strives to make A Crime (O Greeks!) tho it can do, And hath done Service oft to you. But Pardon if, in my defence, I Arm my self with Eloquence: If I have any, sure it hath Oft serv'd you with untainted Breath. It shows a Spirit simple proud To Brag and Boast of Noble Blood. Ancestors deeds belong to them, And only such as do the same. Now seeing Ajax doth aver, That he's the Son of Jupiter; I'd have him know, I'll let you see, I'm as much Heavenly Blood as he. Laertes is my Sire, tis known; Arcesius his; and Jove did own Him for his Son; and in those all There was no Vagabond at all. Moreover by my Mother, I Am near a Kin to Mercury. Thus if my Pedigree you mind, A double Deity you'll find. But Gentlemen I do not seek The Arms, because I am a Greek, Of Birth more Noble, by my Mother: Or that my Father Slew no Brother; I scorn a prize thus to inherit, But do according to our Merit. Tho Peleus and Telamon Were Brothers, yet there is not one. That can affirm, on Reasons score; That Ajax Merits are the more. Not Noble Birth, but Honours Plea Must this our cause decide to day. But if Proximity of Blood Be sought, to make your Sentence good: Peleus Achilles did Beget; He Pyrrhus, without all debate. Thus my Companion's Right is none, For where comes Ajax-Telamon? Now take these Arms of great Renown, Bear them to Scyros, or that Town. Where (in a Cell where no Man saw) Achilles Kiss'd Deidamia. Teucer Achilles Cousin is, In all respects, as much as this Poor Sot; yet seeks no Arms nor should He have them, tho he gladly would. But since our present strife must be For deeds, of Magnanimity, My Acts are more (you know right well) Then I can either Mind or Tell; Yet I will humbly show to you A single series of a few. The Goddess Thetis did fore-know What Fate her Son would undergo, Therefore (as she could do no less) Disguis'd him in a Ladies dress; That all with Ajax took her Son To be a Vestal Virgin Nun: With Warlike Arms I mov'd his mind, From trifles of the Female kind. Whilst yet the Male-Maid, stately proud, Did wear a Gown, and Sercenet-Hood. Her manly Courage did grow bold, And on the Shield and Spear lay'd hold; I slily Whisper'd her down right; “Thou Goddess-Man, Hermophrodit, “King Priam's Pallace still doth stand, “To fall by your Victorious hand: “Ne'r dout, what certainly you know, “To prove the Trojans overthrow. With this I seiz'd him (right or wrong) And sent to mighty deeds the Strong. Thus his Exploits to me redound; My Spear King Telaphus did Wound. And when he Yielded (Struck with pain) I like ways made him whole again. Thebes, and Lesbos on the Sea Did low their Sails to you, by me. I Tenedos, and Chrysa Town: With Cylla's Scyros, did throw down: I levell'd both, and civilliz'd them, Altho' Apollo patroniz'd them. Know, likewise, that Lyrnessus Wall, By my Right Hand, was forc'd to fall. To pass the rest, I gave to you, Him who, the cruel, Hector slew. I Hector kill'd, his Armour sue; For those which found him out to you. Now when he's dead, I seek no more, Then when he liv'd, I gave before. As soon as Menelaus Grief Mov'd all the Greeks to grant relief, A Thousand Frigats (if not more) Were streight in Aulis Port, and shore. We waited long, the Wind was still, Or quite contrary, cross, and ill. The cruel Oracles (who knew Who 'twas Diana's Stag that slew.) King Agamemnon did surprize, Commanding him to Sacrifice, His Daughter, whose Blood could asswage, And quench the angry Goddess Rage; But he denies, the Gods reproves, And, in a King, Love Passion moves, His Noble Mind persuaded I, That Iphegenia dear should die; To expiate his Crime by Blood, And propogat his Countreys good. My fault I here confess (you see) Dear Agamemnon Pardon me, That I discuss'd this cruel Cause, For Interest, and 'gainst Natures Laws. The Scepters Care, and Peoples good; Fraternal Love, mov'd him by Blood, To purchase Honour both and Praise, A Crown of Everlasting Bays. I to the Mother went beguil'd, Her not exhorted from her Child: Had Ajax gon, our Flag and Sails Might have been waiting yet for Gales. Then I (all dangers to prevent) To Troy Ambassador was sent; The Court I view'd, and saw it then Well Peopl'd, and yet full of Men: Yet I undaunted, urg'd (at large) The Cause committed to my Charge; I summon'd Paris (tho in vain) To render Helena again. Old Priam and Autenor I Provok'd; but Paris (standing by) With his Coherents did so huff me, That he, and they, seem'd both to cuff me. This Menelaus knows; for he In this first danger, was with me. Now it were tedious to relate What I (opposing adverse Fate) By Wit and Strength did, and intended, Whereby the long War might be ended: When we the Battle first did fight, The Trojans watch'd both Day and Night, Their Walls; so that (by right down blows) There was no way to reach our Foes. Nine Years was spent with beat of Drum; And now the Tenth at last was come. Now where wast thou with all thy might? Who only wast in power to fight; What use serv'd Ajax for? If thou Inquir'st of me what I did do, My Wit supply'd the want of Blows, I did entrap our stubborn Foes; I with a Wall (as I thought meet) Did fence the Trenches of our Fleet. My Fellow Souldiers I rous'd up, And chear'd them with the other Cup; Forbade to fear for what was past; But hope for Victory at last. I exercis'd the Army right, Taught them to Forage both and Fight: When sent to work the Trojan's fall, I still was ready on a call. Behold! when (in a Dream) Old Jove Deceiv'd the King; bade him remove His Camp, and Fleet; and hoise and go, And not expect Troy's overthrow. (Here Menelaus hath no Shame; For Jupiter caused him to Dream.) But why could Ajax not oppose The Power that sided with our Foes? With Tongue and Target too have fought, To bring the Trojan strength to nought: Why did not he all those restrain, Who were returning home again? Why did not he his Armour take? And force the Rabble to forsake Their Head-strong Mutiny? But this To braging Ajax little is: But what if he himself did flie? When thou didst turn thy back; then I, Asham'd, did see thee hoist thy Sails, And fill them with disgraceful Gales: It was not time then to delay; Therefore (incens'd) I thus did say, “My Fellow Soldiers, all, and some, “How are you Cowards thus become? “What Madness makes you leave the Field, “When tottering Troy begins to yield? “What have you gain'd those Ten Years space? “To carry home, but great Disgrace. With such Words, and with much to do, (Which very Grief did move me to,) Their averse Minds I did restrain, And brought them from the Fleet again. Thus Jove, himself, I circumvented, And all his Fraud, and Dreams prevented. The King, a Council then did call, Conven'd his Souldiers, great and small: Whilst base Thersites (in disdain) Provok'd him unto Wrath again, And Ajax durst not once to mutter. For all he makes now such a clutter. And yet the froward Fool, ill bred By me past not unpunished. I did stand up, a Speech did make, Which forc'd the Souldiers undertake The Siege, and (with a new Desire) I set their Courages on Fire. His Acts (howe'er so great they be) In Justice do belong to me; Since I thus Ajax did restrain, And hal'd his Valour back again: Now tell me if one Greek there be, That praiseth and depends on thee? Yet Brother Diomedes Will Confide in his Ulysses still: Tho thou discredit to us seeks, We'll join our Wits to serve the Greeks. If't be a stain, I'm hearty glad To bear the Brand of Diomede; And out of all this Host, to be Chose out by such a Man as he. It is my gain, that he's my Lot; Yet he may chuse to be, or not: And yet 'tis no Disgrace, that I (All fear of Night, and Foe laid by) Bold Dolus slew, who slily came To view our Host, as I had them; And yet I kill'd him not, till he Discover'd his Design to me. And I had learn'd what he detected, And what Perfidious Troy projected. When I had got my full Desire, And had no further to inquire. I after such Exploits as these, Might have returned back, with praise: But yet (not satisfied) I went, Surprized Rhesus in his Tent; And in a Loyal Passion slew The King himself, and all his crew. Thus (having got both wish, and will, And Victor in my Projects still) In Rhesu's Coach, I homeward came, Triumphing on the Wings of Fame. Since for one Night slie Dolon sought Achille's Horse, which stood him nought; I think his Armour should be mine, Who frustrat Dolon's proud Design. Will Ajax keep them back from me? No sure; he'll be more kind, and free. What need I of Sarpedon tell, Who, with his Forces, by us fell. Iphitides, and Cæranus, Alaster, and proud Chromius; Slie Halius join'd with Alcander, And Næmonus, that brave Commander, With Prytanis, and Thoon stout, Chersidamas the counter-scout. Bold Charopes that wrought us woe, And Ennomus, our Fatal Foe; All these brave Fellows, great and small, By bloody Wounds, I kill'd them all. And many more, of common crew, In sight of Troys Walls I slew. And I, dear Country-men, have wounds, Pray give not ear to empty sounds: (With this, his Breast he ript up wide, And laid his Campaign Coat aside;) Behold, and look; lo here they are Fair to be seen, in every Scar: And on the Breast that's load with Cares, And Diligence in your Affairs. Yet Ajax in this tedious War, Hath lost no Blood, nor hath a scar. Now what great matter is't that he (To prove his Magnanimity) Doth brag, that he is Armour brought, And Jove both and the Trojans fought. 'Tis True he did, I'll not detract From such a praise deserving Act. So he ingross, and crave no more Than's justly due upon his score. For all he makes so much to do, Let him grant us some Honour too. Patroclus (that's both stout and wise) Clad like Achilles in Disguise, Beat back the Trojans, when they came To set our Navy in a Flame. He thinks none could with Hector deal, But Ajax, without Parellel. The King himself he doth lay by, And Agamemnon vilisie. And as for me, I am forgot, Of Nine the Last, prefer'd by Lot. But O Invincible for might! What was the event of your Fight? Tho it with Victory was crown'd, Hector went off without a wound. Alas, with what a Tide of Grief (To which no season grants relief) Do I that time to mind recal, Wherein the stately Grecian Wall, Achilles fell; yet Grief, nor fear, Nor Tears, could drown that love I bear Unto his Memory: Therefore, His raised Corps I took and bore; Brought off himself, and Armour too; For which I plead before you now. Sure, Ajax, I have strength to bear, And push the great Achille's Spear. And have a Spirit to perceive, O Greeks, what Honour I receive. Blew Mother Thetis of the Sea, Could not but chuse, and needs must be Ambitious for her dearest Son, That such a Bog-Trot, should put on The Heavenly Gifts, of so great Art, Engrav'd with skill, in every part: He knoweth neither draught, nor line, Which makes the glittering Shield to shine, The Ocean, Earth, and Starry Skie, He knows not in Astrology. The Pleiades and Seven Stars, The Beares that fear no Waves nor Jars, Orion's clear, yet clowdy Sword, The Towns the Target doth afford; But unadvisedly doth prate, And seeks the thing he knows not what. And with what Confidence doth he, In Spiteful Terms object to me? That I the Grecian War did shun, And slight till others had begun: Nor knows he, how he wounds in me Achille's Honour; if it be A Crime, to counterfeit, then we Are conjunct both in Villany. And should a short delay be such A Crime, as Ajax doth avouch; Achilles he doth more defame Than me, since I before him came. His Mother, and my honest Wife (Affraid left we should lose our Life) Did us detain; 'tis very true, We Humour'd them, and Honour'd you: Were this a Crime, I should not fear, Since brave Achilles needs must bear The half of this Reproach; but I Did find Achilles out; but by Proud Ajax I could not be found; Nor can the praise to him redound. Yet let us not admire that he Doth squirt thus Wind-bals so at me. You Worthies he (altho in vain) Doth strive your Honour here to stain; For if I (like a Rascal) laid A Trap, to catch young Palamede; In order to his Accusation, What were you in his Condemnation? But Palamede that very time, Could not defend his open Crime; Which was not forg'd by hear-say lies, But manifested to your Eyes. The Gold which was to work our fall, And price, for which he'd sold us all. Nor was't my fault that Pæan's Son Was left in Lemnos Isle alone. Here he Arraigns your Honours too; Defend your Cause, I leave't to you. For you consented all, whilst I Gave my advice (I'll not deny) Him to withdraw, and to forbear The toil of Marches, and of War. And try to mitigate his Pain, By taking rest and ease again. He did obey, and is alive; And in good Success, like to thrive. This my advice is good and true, And proves the Giver real too. Whom, since the Fates require, that he The Trojans overthrow may be; Command not, but let me alone; And send brave Ajax-Telamon. Who Philoctetes will appease, Tho mad with Passion and Disease. He'll mitigate, and bring him thence, With Charms of Art, and Eloquence. But Simois shall backward go, On Ida Mount no Tree shall grow. Achaia shall promise aid, To tottering Troy: ere it be said, Ulysse's VVit for Greece doth fail, And Sottish Ajax doth prevail; But Philoctetes, tho' thou be Obdur'd in spite, and VVrath 'gainst me; The King, those Nobles, and (what's worse) Shoot'st forth an Everlasting Curse, To light on me; desiring still My Company, my Blood to spill; On thee I'll make a bold attack, I'll bend my VVits, to bring thee back: That both (as our Case doth require) May have their VVish, and Hearts Desire. I'll have thy Shafts (so favour Fate) As I had Helenus of late, As I out-witted (by great ods) And found the Answers of the Gods; A Riddle-knot, wherein did lye, The Trojan Fate, and Destiny. And as I Palla's Fatal signe, Amidst my Foes, forc'd from her shrine. Compar'st with me? When this untaken We'd long ago Troy's Walls forsaken. Now where was Ajax? And the boast Of that brave Man; or was he lost In Fears and Terrour? And how durst Ulysses pass the Watch, and trust Himself to Night; and boldly venter The Trojan Walls, and Towers to enter; Through Souldiers arm'd, in time of War, To take, a Goddess Prisoner, From her own Church; and bring the Prey Back to our Host, the self-same way. Which had I not done, Ajax yet (For all his Valour and his Wit) In vain till now had fac'd the Field; And born his Seven-fold Bull-hide Shield. That Night I Troy Town did take, Since I it invincible did make. Then Ajax hold, and pray leave off, To make your Mouths, to jeer and scoff, At Diomede and me; but know That both our Praises jointly grow. Nor thou alone didst interpose Thy Shield, betwixt our Fleet and Foes; Thou hadst an Host, but I had none, But Honest Diomede alone. Who knew that VVit did strength command, And these belong'd to Head, not Hand; Else he had likewise su'd for these, Or th'other Ajax who for praise Is more deserving. Eury'plus, Thoas, and Idomeneus, Meriones, These Crotians and King Menelaus could withstand Our Enemies; and likewise are Not second unto thee in VVar. Yet all these Noble VVorthies be Content to take Advice of me. Thou'rt only fit for right down blows; But VVit must mitigate our Foes. Thou'rt rash without forecast, but I Can Antidote Contingency. That thou canst Fight, I own, 'tis true; But we must tell what time to you, Thou'rt only strong in Body, I In Mind, and Magnanimity. As Pilots fore mast men that row, And Captains, Centinels, even so I thee excel; and so exceeds Couragious Councels, empty Deeds. In Spirit, and not Legs and Thighs, The Sum of all Perfections lies. Then Gentlemen, and Princes all, These my Exploits to mind recal; For Ten Years Care, and Trouble past, I hope you'll me reward at last. Sum my Deserts, and Judg if I Deserve of you this Dignity. Our VVork is almost at an end, Since I the Fates that did offend, Removed have; and Troys VValls (VVhich I made Vincible) now falls. Now by the hope that we enjoy; And by the fall of tottering Troy; And by those Trojan Gods, which I Took lately from our Enemy. And by what ever doth remain, (VVhich renders our Designs in vain) And by what VVisdom yet may won, Tho bold and doubtful to be done; And by the Fates (if Riddles lye, Unknown in Trojan Destiny) Be mindful, and remember me; Let my reward these Armour be: If not to Ajax them resign; But see Minerva's Fatal sign. The Nobles of the Greeks were mov'd; And Flattering Eloquence approv'd It's Strength, by Charms; the Arms obtain'd From Valour, that never was stain'd. And he who never did retire From Hector, Jove, for Sword, nor Fire. Here vanquish'd yields (without defence) To false informing Eloquence. Him that was never Conquer'd Grief O'ercomes, and finding no relief, Pulls out his Sword, in mad Design, And said, ‘I'm sure that this is mine. ‘Dare base Ulysses plead this too, ‘It sav'd him, but must kill me now. ‘The oft embru'd in Phrygian Blood, ‘That still the Trojans hast withstood; ‘Thy Masters Blood must now embrue; ‘That none but Ajax may subdue ‘Me Ajax; Then his Breast made bare, (For he was vulnerable there) Thrusts in his Sword; and struck with pain, He could not pull it out again. Till gushing gore did force it out, And Blood that issued round about, Made Red the Earth; which did bring forth A Purple Flower, which first had Birth From Hyacinthus VVound, and bears A Dismal Dipthong, drown'd in Tears, Proper to both, for on't is paint His Name, both and the God's complaint.
