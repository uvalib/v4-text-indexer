NÃ¨ men che 'n viso bella, in suono e dolce; E cosÃ¬ canta, e 'l cielo e l' aure molce.â Tasso. TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON, ESQ. THIS TALE IS INSCRIBED BY ONE, WHO ADMIRES HIS GENIUS, AND VALUES HIS FRIENDSHIP. THE NAIAD. A TALE. The gold sun went into the west, And soft airs sang him to his rest; And yellow leaves all loose and dry, Play'd on the branches listlessly: The sky wax'd palely blue; and high A cloud seem'd touch'd upon the skyâ A spot of cloud,âblue, thin, and still, And silence bask'd on vale and hill. 'Twas autumn-tide,âthe eve was sweet, As mortal eye hath e'er beholden; The grass look'd warm with sunny heat,â Perchance some fairy's glowing feet Had lightly touch'd,âand left it golden: A flower or two were shining yet; The star of the daisy had not yet set,â It shone from the turf to greet the air, Which tenderly came breathing there: And in a brook, which lov'd to fret O'er yellow sand and pebble blue, The lily of the silvery hue All freshly dwelt, with white leaves wet. Away the sparkling water play'd, Through bending grass, and blessed flower; Light, and delight seem'd all its dower: Away in merriment it stray'd,â Singing, and bearing, hour after hour, Pale, lovely splendour to the shade. Ye would have given your hearts to win A glimpse of that fair willow'd brook: The water lay glistening in each leafy nook, And the shadows fell green and thin. As the wind pass'd byâthe willow trees, Which lov'd for aye on the wave to look, Kiss'd the pale stream,âbut disturb'd and shook, They wept tears of light at the rude, rude breeze. At night, when all the planets were sprinkling Their little rays of light on high, The busy brook with stars was twinkling,â And it seemed a streak of the living sky; 'Twas heavenly to walk in the autumn's wind's sigh, And list to that brook's lonely tinkling. O pleasant is the water's voice, And pleasant is the water's smile,â The one doth bid the heart rejoice, The other lulls the eye the while. And fresh it is, in the bright breathing day Of the gallant, the lovely, the youthful May; To pass adown banks where the primrose peeps, And watch the young waves with their silver leaps. And lovely is Summer, when Spring is gone by; The light is more constant and rich in the sky, The day is more balmy, the night is more soft, And louder the lark's song is heard up aloft. But how am I wandering,âand what do I sing, I have nothing to do with the Summer or Spring; My season is Autumn,âI may not say, Of the showers of April, or sunlight of May. Yes! Autumn was the tide:âthe time Was somewhat past the evening's prime; The clouds were in the gloom declining; The leaves gave up their glossy shining; Low in her nest the skylark crept, And mid the dew in silence slept; All save the running brook was still, And that kept on humming its wild song at will. âThe waters are merry and pleasant, my page! âThe waters are merry and bright; âNow tell me at once, thou youthful sage, âWhat is so lovely to sight?â âWhat is so mirthful, and mild also, âWhat is so graceful, I fain would know? âSee, the moon is risingâa pale young thing!â âNay, do not give her in thy answering; âBut bid thy fancy a new image bring: âNow speak me, young page, outright.â Lord Hubert look'd o'er his courser's neck, Which fretted like fire beneath the check; He look'd upon the boy, and staid To list the answer that he pray'd. A smile was in his fine dark eye, The white plume in his cap danced high; His short cloak flutter'd fair behind, Playing fantastic in the wind; The steed so spirited, matchless, and fair, Toss'd the white foam on the evening air. âThe waters are merry, my Lord Hubert! âThe waters are merry and bright;â âBut the lady whose heart is pure as the day, âWhose soul is framed of the breath of May, âIs as lovely and mirthful to sight: âHer form is as graceful, her spirit as gay, âHer eye is as tenderly light. âI see the moon will be breaking soon, âBut I will not liken the lovely moon;â âThe evening star, is beaming far, âBut what to me is the evening star? âLord Hubert! the lady we ride to greet, âIs as fair as the wave, and as passingly sweet.â Up to Lord Hubert the page rais'd his look, While his palfrey play'd, and its trappings shook; Up to Lord Hubert with laughing eye, The young boy glanced right cunningly: The moon shone down on his countenance fair, There was tenderness mix'd with gaiety there. Lord Hubert look'd downâbut without a frown,â With a quicken'd smile he look'd adown; At first he was silent, and idly leant O'er the neck of his courser, all proudly bent; His hand hung loose in his sword's fretted chain, And his cheek reclin'd on the proud steed's mane. But anon he exclaimedâand his wild eye flamed With a free delight, as he gaily exclaim'd:â âNow fair fall thy lipâthou page of my heart,â âThat tone on my ear all sweetly fell, âLike the greeting of lovers long torn apart, âLike, touch'd to nun's ear, the convent bell; âNe'er may thy breast feel affliction's smart, âFor, in sooth, fair boy! thou hast spoken well.â For a moment with pleasure his bridle hand shook, And the steed in its joy mock'd the wave on the brook, It play'dâand danced up for a momentâno moreâ Then gently glided on as before. Now forth they rode all silently, Beneath the broad and milky sky, They kept their course by the water's edge, And listen'd at times to the creeking sedge; Or started from some rich fanciful dream, At the sullen plunge of the fish in the stream; Then would they watch the circle bright,â The circle, silver'd by the moonlight,â Go widening, and shining, and trembling on, Till a wave leap'd up, and the ring was gone. Or the otter would cross before their eyes, And hide in the bank where the deep nook lies; Or the owl would call out through the silent air, With a mournful, and shrill, and tremulous cry; Or the hare from its form would start up and pass by; And the watch-dog bay them here and there. The leaves might be rustledâthe waves be curl'dâ But no human foot appear'd out in the world. Now they rode them on, serene and slow, Through a still valley,âall green and low; They look'd about with a passionless eye, At the sleeping grass and the sleeping sky; And felt, as they pass'd through this exquisite part, A slumb'rous melody steal to the heart. Their steeds seem'd patting the turfy ground, Soft, to the water's lulling sound; And they mov'd their heads up and down in the air, As tho' they caught something that gladden'd them there; The steel of their bridles kept playing and ringing, And the airs around them low music were bringing. Up rose the scent of the gentle flowers, As freshly as though they deck'd lady's bowers; In sooth, we may grieve that odours so fair, Are lavish'd so sweetly, when no one is there. The wild rose dwelt on the water's side, The lily shone out on the shivering tide; Ah! who would go dreaming away the night, When its hue is so fair, and its airs are so light. âA little while,ââLord Hubert spoke With a gentle sigh, which his musing broke,â âA little while, my gallant boy! âAnd we shall greet a home of joy. âMy bride in expectation waits, âThe torch of welcome is bright in her gates: âA tear now dims her eye's fair ray, âWhich I alone can kiss away. âA little while, and thou shalt press âThy lady's handâthy own scarce less;â âAnd with soft tales her heart engage, âAnd chat with her, my pretty page! âAlas! I leave her all too long, âAnd do her gentle bosom wrong. âCome, my fair courser, spurn the ground; âPerchance she roams in her unrest, âWith scarf thrown heedless o'er her breast, âAnd sandals left unbound; âPerchance the comb no more caresses âHer golden hair in sunny tresses, âBut leaves them wild and unwound; âAnd her jewels and rings flung carelessly by, âIn dark and rude disorder lie; âNo gem left unmov'd,âsave the tear in her eye. âOh! I will press her bosom to mine, âThe gentle, the lovely Angeline!â Lord Hubert look'd forth;âsay, what hath caught The lustre of his large dark eye? Is it the form he hath lov'd and sought? Or is it some vision his fancy hath wrought? He cannot pass it by. It rises from the bank of the brook, And it comes along with an angel look; Its vest is like snow, and its hand is as fair, Its brow seems a mingling of sunbeam and air, And its eyes so meek, which the glad tear laves, Are like stars beheld soften'd in summer waves; The lily hath left a light on its feet, And the smile on its lip is passingly sweet; It moves serene, but it treads not the earth;â Is it a lady of mortal birth? Down o'er her shoulders her yellow hair flows, And her neck through its tresses divinely glows; Calm in her hand a mirror she brings, And she sleeks her loose locks, and gazes, and sings. THE NAIAD'S SONG. âMy bower is in the hollow wave, âThe water lily is my bed; âThe brightest pearls the rivers lave âAre wreath'd around my breast and head. âThe fish swims idly near my couch, âAnd twinkling fins oft brush my brow; âAnd spirits mutely to me crouch, âWhile waters softly o'er them flow. âThen come thee to these arms of mine, âAnd come thee to this bosom fair; âAnd thou mid silver waves shalt twine âThe tresses of my silky hair. âI have a ring of the river weed, â'Twas fasten'd with a spirit's kiss; âI'll wed thee in this moonlight mead,â âAh! look not on my love amiss.â She play'd with her locks; and she sang to the night, And her song came mellow'd through her eyes' light; And ever her hand, with a graceful motion, Like the rise and fall of a wave on the ocean, Its pearly brightness was gently bringing, Under the shade of that hair's silken stringing; And still on she wander'd, tenderly singing. 'Lord Hubert check'd his steedâamaz'dâ And on that lovely lady gaz'd: He doff'd his cap; and his open brow, Shone nobly and purely like Heaven's own snow. He held the feather, all shadowy white, To screen his eye from the moon's still light; And he gaz'd upon her, mute,âunmoving,â And his bosom felt changingâand newly loving. âTrust not that figure, Lord Hubert, I pray thee;ââ With tears the pretty page intreatedâ âA beauty at home is lingering, I say thee, âAnd shall her lip be never greeted? âOh, dare not, my master dear, to kiss âAught so airy and fleeting as this; âBut haste thee home where a kind lip glows, âAs ruddy and fresh as the leaf of the rose. âTrust not the eyes of that lovely spirit, âDeath doth their wooing light inherit;â âTrust not those locks of the burning gold, âThey will twine round the heart 'till it's ruin'd and cold;â âTrust not that hand, though a lily it seems,â âIt will trouble thy waking, and madden thy dreams. âLord Hubert! Lord Hubert! thy soul waxes idle; âDash thy spur deep,âshake thy long loosen'd bridle; âAway to the heart that is earthly and dear! âFair love lies before theeâand ruin is here.â âMy page, be still!âthere cannot be ill âIn aught so graceful, gentle, and bright; âShe moves more freely than that racing rill, âAnd I must and will alight; âAnd hap me deathâor hap me good, âI'll woo this fairy of the flood.â âAh, pauseâLord Hubert, pause!âthou'rt dreaming; âNay follow not this form of seeming: âAnd wilt thou imitate the moon, âIn looking kind, and changing soon? âThe stars of Heaven are on thee,âyet, âOh, yet retract, ere they be set. âAlas!âthe luckless, the beautiful bride! âHer heart must break in its innocent pride; âShe may bend and pray to the Virgin Mother,â âHer earth's Hope comes notâhe woos another!â âThe Summer dews are shed, âO'er earth's balmy slumber;â âHer tears, by sorrow fed, âShall those dews out-number. âThe gentle gusts of wind, âThrough the branches dying;â âShall in sooth remind âOf a young bride's sighing.â âDear spirit! to thy breast I come,â âThy breast more white than water's foam; âOpen thy gentle arms, and take âThe heart that beats but for thy sake; âI greet thy singing, and thy saying,â âOh! let me with thy locks be playing!â The words are pastâthe page is goneâ Lord Hubert hath alighted down: The words are pastâLord Hubert's steed Is from its master's pressure freed; Loos'd to the windâit will not stand, But flies the check of mortal hand. The page is fledâthe steed is gone, Lord Hubert lingers there alone; Aloneâsave that light form that sleeks Her tresses down her gleaming cheeks. She woos him with her voice and look;â Beside her crawls the enamour'd brook, Touch'd with her eye's delicious ray, And muttering a quiet delight on its way. She put forth her hand, and the moonbeam fell On a hue like its own,âand it slept there well; She fix'd her fair eyes on Lord Hubert's face, And look'd him to stillness in that pale place. He paus'dâhe fear'dâtill her voice sigh'd along, In the beautiful, soul-fed breath of song:â Then he started, and clasp'd her lily white hand, Oh! as sweet as the violet leaf, and as bland. The sceneâthe musicâthat touch of herâ Gave his high soul a passionate stir; He kiss'd her lips,âand that ardent kiss Was sweeter than aught on earth, I wis; It was long and silent, as though the soul chose To linger for ever on that living rose:â Yes! her lip was yielding, and glowing, and fresh, And seem'd all of flowers, and not of flesh;â And the breath that pass'd o'er it made him start, Like the sudden full scent of the rose's heart. She rubb'd his brow with her balmy finger, And parted his curls with playful delight; And idly and sweetly she sang,âand bright, Ah brightâmost bright shone her eyes, fair Singer! She took a braid of her yellow hair, And deck'd his forehead with graceful care; She took a pearl from her floating vest, And fix'd it fondly on his breast. He dallied with her dimpled cheek, And wreath'd his hand in her tresses meek; And leant his lip 'gainst her eyelids white, And look'd on her eyes in their shadowy light. He press'd her snowy bosom to his, And dropt on its beauty many a kiss; His heart was maddeningâhis eyes were reeling, He was wild, I ween, with passionate feeling! âWilt thou follow me now?ââsaid the spirit endearing; âIs thy soul warmly loving, or coldly fearing? âThis placid earth, I leave for a while; âThe morning star will rise full soon, âAnd fast will fade the fickle moon; âAnd day will indolently break, âWith many a thin and ruddy flake:ââ She spake him with a smile. âOh! come, and we will hurry now âTo a noble crystal pile; âWhere the waters all o'er thee like music shall flow, âAnd the lilies shall cluster around thy brow. âWe'll arise, my love! when morning dew âIs on the rose-leaf, soft and new; âWe'll sit upon the tawny grass, âAnd catch the west-winds as they pass; âAnd list the wild birds while they sing, âAnd kiss to the water's murmuring. âThou shalt gather a flower, and I will wear it; âI'll find the wild bee's nest, and thou shalt share it; âThou shalt catch the bird, and come smiling to me, âAnd I'll clasp its wing, and kiss it for thee; âAnd oft thy arm shall be round my waist, âAnd my hand on thy shoulder shall gently be plac'd. âThou shalt sleep mid my golden hair, âWhich shall shadow thine eyelids fair; âThine arms shall enwreathe my ivory form, âAll nestling near thee, white and warm; âI will not sleep, unless thou'rt beside me, âHere is the ring, now peace betide me; âI take thy heart,âthou wilt not dissemble; âFollow my steps,âthe dews shall not tremble.â On the lady glided slow, Her feet on the grass left a moonlight glow; On she went close to the water's side, With a quiet, undulating pride. The moon shone down upon her coldly, Lord Hubert follow'd her course right boldly. At the brink of the brook she paused awhile, And turned to her earthly love with a smile:â âFear not to followâthou'rt charm'd from death, âThe water will love thee, and lend thee breath.â She stept into the silver wave,â And sank, like the morning mist, from the eye; Lord Hubert paus'd with a misgiving sigh, And look'd on the water as on his grave. But a soften'd voice came sweet from the stream, Such sound doth a young lover hear in his dream; It was lovely, and mellow'd, and tenderly hollow:â âStep on the wave, where sleeps the moon beam, âThou wilt sink secure through its delicate gleam, âFollow, Lord Hubert!âfollow!â He startedâpass'd on with a graceful mirth, And vanish'd at once from the placid earth. The waters prattled sweetly, wildly, Still the moonlight kissed them mildly; All sounds were mute, save the screech of the owl, And the otter's plunge, and the watch-dog's howl; But from that cold moon's setting, never Was seen Lord Hubertâhe vanish'd for ever: And ne'er from the breaking of that young day Was seen the light form that had passed away. But on Autumn evenings, some have said, When the moon shines full on the hill's yellow head, That the voice of a spirit rises slowly, Chaunting a ditty, lovely and lowly: It sings serenely, tenderly wild, Like a mother lulling her rosy child; It fascinates the soul of the hearer, But dies off in distance when ye draw nearer. No youth I ween hath ever listen'd, But his heart hath hush'd,âand his eye hath glisten'd; And he hath stood like breathless clay, Smiling in stillness the hours away. Like a fair bride, young Angeline Walks in her hall,âand beauty dwells Bright on her brow, as on a shrine, Yet mournfully her bosom swells; And though she seems to smile, and say Light words,âher breast is far from gay: Sorrow is hid in that fair part, The lone companion of her heart. Those who will watch her cheek and eye, Her hush'd anxieties may 'spy; She hath her griefs,âfor she is tender,â Her young heart aches beneath its splendour; Its thoughts forsake that rich array, In sooth they wander far away. With smiles she strives to hide her fears, And still her spirit drinks her tears. The lamps are brightly burning o'er her, The dancers thread their path before her; The minstrels send their voices round her, And beauty's graceful daughters bound her. The fairest ones are near the bride, In beauty's light, and splendour's pride; But none is there whose features shine So fair as those of Angeline. Her cheek is like the blush which Even Flings gently o'er the western heaven; Her wreathed locks in clusters deck Her brow, and shade her snowy neck; The violet lustre of her eye, Mocks a serene Italian sky; And on her lips her voice reposes, Like music in a bower of roses. She stands within the circle there, All mild, and beautifully fair; Her light, the light of others mars,â 'Tis Hesperus amid the stars! The night wears late; Lord Hubert lingers: Hush'd are the dancers and the singers; The guests retireâand Angeline Steals from the revels to repine. Up to the loneliest tower she hies, To watch beneath the midnight skies; To wake and watch, while others sleep; While others lightly dream,âto weep. Her hair, disorder'd by the wind, Floats long and mournfully behind; The moon shines deeply from the sky, She looks on it with silent eye, And her bosom rises with a sigh. She leans upon the turret cold, Where twines the ivy thick and old; And to the quiet of the night, Thus tells her tale of lost delight. âAll other hearts are now at rest, âBut mine is breaking in my breast; âHubert woo'd me but to grieve me, âHubert won me but to leave me. âThe night is passingâcomes he not? âIs he betray'd?âam I forgot? âAt morn he left me, and he vow'd âTo see me, ere the evening cloud âCrept over Heaven;âand night is here, âAnd still his courser comes not near. âDoth his young heart so lightly prize me? âOh! all too hastily he flies me! âHe knows not how my heart can love, âIts feelings danger cannot moveâ âNor pain subdueânor troubles calm,â âEver 'twould be his sorrow's balm. âHe knows me notâbut now too late âI murmur at the frown of fate: âThe morning star will quickly shine; âThou art forsaken, Angeline!â As the light broke, she deem'd she heard Her lover's voice in the starting bird; She deem'd it was Lord Hubert's steed That bridleless fed in the fresh green mead: But noâand she left the pale chill air, All sicken'd to see the day breaking fair. And now within her chamber, she Sank on her couch despairingly; And bath'd her pillow with silent tears, The gentle offspring of her fears. The sky look'd keen through her window pane, And cast on the floor a pallid stain: The small bird chirp'd on the jasmine tree, That up round her lattice grew green and free, With flowery stars all fair to see. She saw the rook go through the morning Heaven, To return straight and happy at fall of even; Her sobbing heart broke the silence now, And she press'd her hand 'gainst her feverish brow: She startedâshe shrunkâher shuddering breath Shaped these wordsâthe words of death. âWhat is this that coldly clings âTo my lip, and to my waist? âWhence is that wild voice that sings? âA spirit's breath around me rings, âBy marble I'm embraced!â She press'd her ears,âbut the voice still sounded; She struggled,âbut still those arms surrounded Her tender form; and she strove to pray, But the prayer on her trembling lip melted away. Death like a shadow came: her breast Serenely heav'd itself to rest; Like a wave that quietly Swells, and dies upon the sea, Ah! tenderly her blue eyes beam'd, Of Heaven, ere life was past, they gleam'd; And her lips resign'd the red, Which youth had so profusely shed. She spoke ere life was wholly past, Her voice was lovely to the last; It breath'd like youthful minstrel's lays, The melody of other days! âAlas! thenâthou art silent now, âAnd the wave rocks upon thy brow; âAnd these,âthy arms around me press'd âLike bands of ice upon my breast, âAre fresh now from the chilling water, âTo me they come like silent slaughter. âMy cheek with thine hath shuddering met, âFor thine is stillâand coldâand wet. âWhere is thy page?âhe ne'er return'd, âThough the moon shone outâand the night torch burn'd. âThou art at rest in the faithless wave, âAnd thy page is laid in a distant grave. âI have felt no kiss since I wedded theeâno, âSave this freezing kiss that aches on my brow: âI have had no clasp from thy armsâsave one, âWhich has chill'd my lonely bosom to stone. âI lov'd thee while living and loving;âand still, âThough thou hast heap'd on me falsehood and ill; âThy name lingers with me, and shapes my last breath, âAnd I sigh it, Lord Hubert, and love thee in death!â POEMS. STANZAS. 1 When first I lov'd, my heart was young, And boyish fondness fired my tongue; But years have fled, delight is gone, My lip hath learnt a gloomy tone. 2 The day was fair, the day flew by, And left my weary heart to sigh; The eyes that made my bosom bright, Have parted with their gentle light. 3 I woo'd, as youthful lovers woo, I sigh'dâand hop'dâand prosper'd too; My breast was young Maria's shrine, Her dearest thoughts were wreath'd with mine. 4 We sought no stranger forms to greet:â When absent, how we sigh'd to meet! Nought was so sweet beneath the skies, As gazing on each other's eyes. 5 We breath'd the morning's merriest air, And heard the wild birds every where; Their song a mellow pleasure brought, It seem's the echo of our thought. 6 Along the water's edge we stray'd, The light waves sparkled as they play'd; They danc'd along through grass and flowers, As bright and happy as our hours. 7 We lov'd to seek some shady spot, Where the cold world was all forgot; To linger, and our hearts entrance With elder tales of high romance. 8 Dear were the dreams to her and me,â The waking dreams of faÃ«ry; Of forms that sleep on rocking leaves, Or haunt the waves on Summer eves. 9 Together on the turf we sate, Ere evening's hour was wearing late; And watch'd the moon ascend on high Her blue throne in the silent sky. 10 Maria's bosom knew no fears, Her eye a stranger was to tears; To me her very soul she lent, And I preserv'd it innocent. 11 That eye is dark, that gentle breast Is loveless now, and chill'd to rest; That soul is dwelling now on high,â It lives a star that cannot die. MARGARET. 1 The maid I well remember now, Though time hath travell'd since we met; She liv'd beneath a mountain's brow, The youthful Margaret! 2 She was the spirit of the place, With eye so wild, and cheek so fair; Her form so playful in its grace, Mock'd her own mountain air. 3 The rustic dress became her well,â How dear to trace its beauty now! And rich the natural ringlets fell O'er her delightful brow. 4 There was a music in her speech, That gave the heart a soft delight; Like murmuring waves that kiss the beach On a still Summer night. 5 With looks and language innocent, She won the heart of Memory; Which oft in busy scenes hath sent Thoughts to her silently. 6 Her home I saw at day's decline; It was in sooth a lovely spot; And fair the starry jessamine Wreath'd o'er the little cot. 7 I lov'd the loud brook's sparkling haste, I lov'd the fields and mountains green; And her whose fairy presence graced The wildness of the scene. 8 Oh, should my feet in future days Wander again beside the stream That by her lonely cottage plays, My heart would pause and dream:â 9 'Twould dream of hours for ever gone, Of hours which never more can be; Yet she who like a spirit shone, Would brighten memory. 10 Though wild is life's tempestuous gale, May she escape the stormy hour; And, like the violet of the vale, Live an unbroken flower! 11 Oft shall I turn me to the past, And muse upon the hour I met With her, whose form such brightness cast,â The youthful Margaret! A TALE. ââA simple song to thinking hearts.â Wordsworth. 1 âAnd who art thou, poor silent one! Whose eyes, enamour'd of the earth, Look down as if thy days were done, And all was lost of hope or mirth? What leads thee oft at fall of night To haunt this place of tombs, and sit As if thy soul had ta'en its flight, And pitying heaven had welcom'd it?â 2 âThou hast a heart,âand I will say My fearful tale;âand thou wilt weep: I'll tell thee why I loathe the day, And what forbids my breast to sleep. Thou shalt hear words of sorrow break From these poor withered lips,âand see My eye in burning sadness speak:â List to my taleâI'll tell it thee. 3 âYears have gone by, since o'er this scene, Hope her bright wreath of pleasures wove Beneath these elmsâunheard,âunseen,â I walk'd all idly with my love: He offered me a generous heart, He woo'd me with a guileless tongue; I knew his passion free from art, And on his vows with fondness hung. 4 âHere when the summer day declined, We met with tenderness and truth; And traced what joys we both should find After the sunset of our youth: We pictured innocent delights, And told them with a tender glee;â Of cottage pranks, on winter nights, And children prattling round the knee. 5 âAnd oh! we stray'd by streamlet too, In fancy, at fair Evening's hour, When falls her soft and ruddy hue O'er every leaf, o'er every flower: We fondly plann'd a gentle home, Mid clustering trees of evergreen; And lov'd in wistful thought to roam Around the visionary scene. 6 âWe deem'd how very sweet 'twould be, To labour for our young ones' food; And in each other's company, Converse beside the fire of wood; To seek for rest, unscath'd by care, And wake at day dawn full of hope; To wander in the morning air, And work upon a sunny slope. 7 âThus would we while the hour away, And partâwith promises to meet; And how we watched the slow-paced day, Walk to the west with tedious feet! Again we metâhe named the time,â I promis'd to become a bride; It was not mine to have the crime Of treating manliness with pride. 8 âThe night before the marriage morn, We had been lingering sweetly late; And planning too, to meet at dawn,â That dawn to me how desolate! My lover saw me to my cot, And kiss'd my cheekâand bless'd my sireâ He wentâI weptâI met him not From that lone night:âhe died by fire! 9 â'Twas midnight when that flame on high Stream'd reddening o'er a cloudy heaven; 'Twas midnight when that awful sky By fearful shouts and screams was riven: I wokeâthe air seemed clear as day, But coldly sadâand redly light; I roseâI wander'd on the way, Mid forms that throng'd that burning night. 10 âGreat God! it was my lover's cot; The flames were fierceâI stood like stone; I saw his formâmy eyes were hotâ The floor broke inâthat form was gone! I saw no moreâmy sense grew blind, Till at my home by tender care My life awoke,âbut not my mind,â That darkly slept in its despair! 11 âBut sense return'dâthe sense of what? The sense of utter wretchedness! The feeling of a hopeless lot; Of grief which would for ever press: What then was life? a bitter weight! A curse upon a weary heart; And I, so wildly free of late, In silent suffering went apart. 12 âThe horror of that fatal night Was with me;âoh! I lived on fears!â And shadows rose before my sight, And fierce flames crackled in my ears: I long'd for some cold wint'ry spot, Where snow and bleakness meet the view, On which to build my lonely cot, And take my burning bosom to. 13 âI shunn'd all eyesâI shunn'd all light, And shrunk with loathing from the fire Which in my cottage burnt so bright; It told a tale too darkâtoo dire: In winter's cold I sat alone, And liv'd but in the days gone by; And sometimes they have forced a groan, And charm'd a tear into my eye. 14 âBut long it was ere I could weep, And long it was ere I could sigh, A very fever was my sleep; I dreamt but of the dark red sky, And of the crashing floor; and then With terror I awoke, and screams,â To trace o'er maddening truth again, And wed reality with dreams. 15 âYears now are pastâand here I love, When my heart's hue night-glooms restore, With melancholy soul to rove, Where I have walk'd so blest before; To wander mid the silent tombs, And linger under every tree Where in the evening's tender glooms He sighed to meâand talked to me. 16 âHe sigh'd as gentle hearts will sigh; He talk'd with all the soul of youth; There was a lustre in his eye, That caught its finest ray from truth: He heard my little griefs with tears, And drew me nearer to his heart, And kiss'd my cheekâand hush'd my fears, And sooth'd my bosom's lightest smart. 17 âThere's none to soothe that anguish now, In this cold world I'm all alone; The tears that o'er my pale cheek flow, Are now my sole companions grown. But life decaysâand let it pass;â I shall not long be Sorrow's slave: A little whileâand this wild grass Will rustle lonely o'er my grave.â 18 ââPoor mourner! oh, thou art indeed To a dark life of horror bound He who ordain'd thy heart should bleed, Alone can heal its aching wound: No words from earthly lips can cheer The darkness of thy memory All that can give a comfort here, Is to find hearts that weep for thee.â STANZAS. 1 Thou art not lost!âthy spirit giveth Immortal peace,âand high it liveth: Thou art not mute!âwith angels blending, Thy voice is still to me descending. 2 Thou art not absent!âsweetly smiling I see thee yet,âmy griefs beguiling: Soft o'er my slumbers art thou beaming,â The sunny spirit of my dreaming! 3 And when the morn is palely breaking, Thy fair form woo's me on my waking, Its light my soul is madly drinking,â It lulls the pain of lonely thinking. 4 Thou art not changed!âthy cheek, unfaded, Blushes,âby raven tresses shaded:â Thou art not lost!âso fancy talketh,â Thy spirit in its beauty walketh. 5 It glides all beautifully by me, And gently smiles ere it will fly me; The blush its dimpling cheek discloses Is like the hue of youthful roses. 6 Thine eye-lids seem not yet concealing In death, their orbs of matchless feeling; Their living charms my heart still numbers,â Ah! sure they do but veil thy slumbers. 7 A lustre o'er thy brow,âdelaying Like evening's silvery light,âis playing: I see thee nowâthy dark locks dancing,â Come,âlike the soul of song advancing. 8 As kind thou art!âfor still thou'rt meeting This breast, that gives thee tender greeting;â And shall I deem thee alter'd?ânever: Thou'rt with me wakingâslumberingâever!â THE FAIRIES. ââElves, âWho sleep in buds the day.â Collins. ââSpan long elves that dance about a pool.â B. Jonson. The moon was wandering quietly Over the starry spotted sky; And sending down a silvery light To deck the melancholy night;â Green leaves caught a pallid hue, Fresh grass whitened to the view; All was still o'er earth and trees, So reposing was the breeze:â Here and there a cloud was spread, Calm and bright above the head, Steep'd in light the moon had shed. In the mead, a little lake Seem'd, like Nature, not awake; Waveless was its cool, clear breast, By the moonbeams charm'd to rest;â And its lilies pure and white, Breath'd a perfume on the night, As if to mingle with the quiet light. I, by meditation led, On the turf my limbs had spread, And was gazing on the skies, With thought-enamour'd soul and eyes. Fancy wander'd wildly free, Herself amusing sportively,â Peopling all the paly air With forms fantastically fair; Or in fine imaginings, Calling forth diviner things From the filmy clouds,âdeep skyâ And stars that beam'd so watchfully. There I layâby Fancy wrought Into most luxurious thought; When upon my list'ning ear A soft note stole,âdeliciousâclear;â 'Twas such as breathes in distant vale, From a full-hearted nightingale; That bird, so skill'd a soul to move, Made up of music and of love:â It came with gentle, gentle swell, And richly roseâand finely fell.â I look'd upon the placid lake, From which the music seem'd to wake,â And lo! from out each lily's cup A fairy started, merrily up, And with a little rushy wand, Push'd its flowery boat to land. Round the lily's snowy whiteness Broke a playful, sparkling brightness; As if the stars were hurrying there, Dancing round the watery car, To gaze on forms so lightly fair. Deep within the pebbly pool Stood the palace, bright and cool;â Transparent were the walls. By night, The moon sent down its purest light,â Which, though at first so soft from heaven, More mellow through the wave was given;â And even the sun's warm ray at noon, Went there as gently as the moon. From the cups the Fairies darted, Which, no longer spell-bound, started Back again to seek for rest On the lake's translucent breast. O'er a hillock, daisy-speck'd, And with drooping cowslips deck'd, Cluster'd all the fairy-court, In the moon-beams form'd to sport. I listen'd, breathless with delight, To the elves all wild and bright, Fluttering on the charmed night. Their wings so delicately play'd, That the dew upon the blade Trembled notâbut calmly fair, Beam'd to make the light more rare. Some shot upward to the moon,â Went with thought, and came as soon:â Others, on the cloud's edge seated, All the stars surrounding greeted. But ere long I saw a fairy, Floating on his pinions airy, Take a honeysuckle horn And wind it;âquick the breath was borne Musically soft, like love, To the sportive elves above, On the clouds, or near the moon:â And, like falling showers at noon In the beams of April-day, Down they shot their sparkling way. âCome,ââ said one, with such a voice As bade the listening heart rejoice;â 'Twas like the air in heaven that lives,â Or like the breath which evening gives, When the mind is Fancy's guest, And the sun salutes the west With his purple lip, that flushes The bashful sky with rosy blushes:â âCome, ye sparklers, come to earth! âFurl your wings, which fan with mirth: âAll, like summer bloom, descend,â âOn our Fairy-queen attend. âMake her couch of flowers, that spring âO'er this meadow;âdeftly bring âThe violets, so blue and sweet, âTo throw around her pearly feet:â âAnd the lilies seek, and shed, âTo form a pillow for her head. âOn primrose couch her form shall rest, âWith pansies scatter'd near her breast, âLet the daisy, yellow-hearted, âWith its white leaves starry-parted, âAnd the cowslips, yellowy pale, âServe her as a flowery veilâ âCatch the moon-beams from her eyes, âAnd delight her as she lies!ââ Oh! 'twas a bewitching sight, To watch these revellers of the night Wand'ring o'er the silent mead, To gather flowers to form a bed For their pretty queen to lie in;â The air grew fresher with their flying,â The dew each form's reflection gave,â And in its sweet sleep laugh'd the wave. The couch was made,âthe young queen shed Her beauty-brightness o'er the bed;â Alas!âthe breezes from the west Came to sing her heart to rest;â They set a floating cloud before The placid Moon,âand all was o'er;â The Fairies faded into air, And left me lying lonely there.
