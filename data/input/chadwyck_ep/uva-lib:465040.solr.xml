Spring is my theme, with her attendant throng, That to the covert or the plain belong; Earth's beauteous tracts that endless forms assume, The sweets of Nature, and her various bloom; The gentle sunshine, and soft trickling showers, The whisp'ring gales, and downy-pinion'd hours, That ever in their kindly flight display Something creative of the poet's lay. On such a theme, O for the Mantuan quill, To paint with fancy, and correct with skill! Come, meek-ey'd Genius of the Vernal Year, Whatever gentle name delights thine ear, Whether what mortals, or what angels use, Propitious now be present with the Muse, While she essays in artless strains to sing The opening beauties of the new-born Spring By Spring, in the following poem, the writer does not restrict himself to that precise period circumscribed by three months, the usual sense in which it is understood; but considers it in a more extensive light, as comprehending all that part of the agreeable Season in which vegetation is carried on.. Pardon the numbers, Young, that, lightly penn'd, Would to the candour of thy ear pretend, That candour which solicits still the charge, To lessen faults, and beauties to enlarge; Hence to derive what their deserts disclaim, What sordid riches cannot purchase, fame. To paint the florid landscape as it blooms, Swells with fresh sweets, or with deep thickets glooms; To trace, on raptur'd Fancy's airy wing, The Progress of the youthful-featur'd Spring, As boundless round her splendid eye she throws, On earth and skies her living smile bestows; This they attempt: O favour the design, Then shall the Season with new lustre shine; Then shall the winds in gentler whispers blow, And limpid streams with softer cadence flow; Each blossom breathe more rich effluvias round, And Music charm with sweeter powers of sound: If, in Life's closing scene of home-felt ease, Aught can below the songs of angels please; When but Religion boasts the power to charm, And not even Death can in approach alarm; When kings unenvy'd rule Earth's parted ball, Eternity thy wish, thy hope, thy all. Eternity!—dread, solemn, pleasing thought, When Virtue's sons, to the last conflict brought, Humble, though firm, expectants of the sky, Like Young have liv'd, like Young have learn'd to die! Now Winter, warn'd by the revolving sun, His gloomy period of dominion run, While a dark mist of vapours round him forms, From every quarter gathers in his storms, And locks up all his magazines of cold, That late requir'd the mantle's thickest fold; Then, while to follow all his blasts prepare, O'er the uncultur'd heath, or mountain bare, Speeds sullen to the North's congenial sky, Where icy deserts meet his downcast eye; Where barren tracts immense, to Spring unknown, With all the depths of wildness overgrown; Where frightful glooms, scarce visited by day, Give his collected tempests dreadful play: Hither, where chaos its first state asserts, The rugged Tyrant frowningly departs; But not before, in his reluctant flight, From some huge promontory's snow-clad height, He turns, and with indignant groan, as if! A deluge thunder'd o'er some shatter'd cliff, Beholds the Empress of the coming year, Spring, in the chambers of the south appear. From the bright prospect he averts his face Invidious, and accelerates his pace. She comes! the fairest daughter of the skies, With countenance serene, and starry eyes, Attended by the dazzling lord of day, Advancing in his broad ecliptic way. A camus green, not wove in mortal loom, Of texture light, and scented with perfume, In many a shining fold falls loose behind, And swells, and waves, and wantons in the wind. An emerald girdle, wrought in curious taste With mystic figures, binds her slender waist. Selected flowers, in beauteous order laid, Encircling her smooth fragrant temples shade. Down her slopt neck, white as unsullied snow, In graceful wreaths her liberal tresses flow. Dependent from her hand, of waxen hue, A casket richly stor'd, she holds to view, Where all those objects, various that partake Of beauty, or in drapery or make, To charm the studious thought, the pensive hour, From the tall cedar, to the dew-dropt flow'r, (Assemblage vast) conceal'd in embryo lie, Soon to unfold beneath the genial sky: Luxuriant these, while fostering zephyrs blow, And all the season's vital fervours glow, Her gifts restricted by no sordid bound, She scatters and diffuses all around. She comes! and with her Peace, Content, and Mirth, Pleas'd to see Nature's offsprings start to birth; To see unnumber'd forms of beauty rise, Where-e'er she glances round her dew-bright eyes; From Winter's sleep ten thousand objects wake, Spring into life, and all its sweets partake. When pale Aurora op'd her feeble eye, The fleecy clouds that spread the eastern sky; Or when, in course oblique, the distant sun His journey, short and comfortless, had run, The languid streaks, that ting'd the blue expanse, Were kindly-flitting signs of her advance: While, in the liquid regions of the air, To birds of gentler nature yet severe, The sky-lark, pois'd on elevated wing, Predictive first made her attempts to sing; A prelude to that universal song To ravish from the vocal groves ere long. She comes! on no ungracious errand sent, Let sloth not counteract her kind intent; To lavish plenty with unsparing hand, At Culture's friendly call, to every land. Hence, num'rous arts their origin derive, And Commerce in due vigour kept alive. Hence, Industry, with unrelaxing hands, Around a world dispenses her commands. Hence, new inventions sharpen human wit, And various duties various objects fit. Hence, stated labours brace the active nerve, And from disease the healthful frame preserve. Hence, from the lawless rage of fierce desires, The soften'd heart a gentler mold acquires; To the rough manner, and deportment wild, Succeeds, at length, the tractable and mild. Hence, all the tender soft affections rise, That bind mankind by universal ties; Those passions, that with noblest ardours burn, Or of a social, or a patriot turn. Each office, hence, of kindness and respect, Which to ennoble serve, while they connect. Hence, sceptred princes, and the mighty great, Rob'd in the purple finery of state; Oft vain distinction to maintain alone, The distance from a cottage to a throne, Although but badges of exterior sign, Which should as proofs but secondary shine. Hence, in the delicacy of attire, While all hearts feel their pow'r, all eyes admire, Woman, the queen of beauty, looks so fair, So soft, so exquisite, beyond compare; Through all her frame transfus'd the living ray Divine, that kindles darkness into day; Which shot through Nature, on etherial wing, Changes the gloom of Winter into Spring; Pierces earth's most retir'd recesses through, And bids a new creation rise to view: While not a cherub, blooming from the skies, Can match the humid splendour of her eyes; Her outward form in dignity and grace, Or the mild open glory of her face. She comes! ye nymphs, and jovial swains, prepare With choicest gifts to entertain the fair, Gifts she despises longer to detain, Than to refund with vast increase of gain. Let all things wear their softest aspects round, The landscape polish'd, and improv'd the ground. Else, will the Goddess with a scornful pride, Attended by her Graces, turn aside, Disdaining there to cast her partial eye, Where all things in a rude disorder lie; Aside, where greater taste attracts her view, What art effects, or elegance can do. Let mantling groves (soon one expansive shade) Be fitted up to lodge the charming maid; The flow'ry tribe, which science scarce can count, The hedge, parterre, the arbour, and the mount, The copse, the orchard, nursery, and pond, Pavilion, grot, and labyrinth beyond, The lengthen'd alley, vista, and cascade, Attractive all of her fair presence made. She comes! descending from an amber cloud, While Nature in grand chorus shouts aloud, The balm and warmth prolific to infuse, Through earth's cold womb, and shed the fatt'ning dews; Thy elder sister, radiant Summer, born, Mild in the soften'd blushes of the morn. Up, husbandman! for shame, unactive now! Up to the manly labours of the plough, To which alike the monarch, and the clown. Is for his crook indebted, or his crown. Adjust your tackle, yoke your well-fed steer, Behold the quick advances of the year. For you, the tedious night less lengthen'd grows, And what it loses to the day bestows. For you, the skies in ceaseless bounty pour The lucid dew-drops, or the copious show'r. From southern climes, for you, the zephyr brings Congenial mildness on its rosy wings; To a loose texture yields the kindly land, That breaks apace, and crumbles to the hand. Juices, for you, fermenting to and fro, Through earth's elastic tubes meand'ring flow. Haste, peasant, to the field, and sidelong lay The yielding surrow to the pointed ray; That Spring, arriv'd, may bid the mellow'd soil Soon amply recompense your honest toil; That riches, free from all the guilt of trade, May ease your cares, when youth and vigour fade; When years and industry have silver'd o'er Your honour'd locks with venerable hoar; More venerable thus, in Virtue's sight, Than the ag'd warriour's from the fields of fight. She comes! around her lenient zephyrs play, As, sweetly smiling, on she wins her way, And copious, from each balm-collecting wing, The joyful year's ambrosial odours fling; Diffusive heat breathes in each friendly gale, And soft'ning spreads along the fertile vale. In every bush the feather'd quire convene, With songs to welcome their approaching queen; Each ardent strains its little quiv'ring throat, To warble forth a bold unrival'd note; Sounds infinitely vary'd they practise, Sink to the lute, or to the clarion rise: While Echo, sitting in her rocky cell, On every tone delighted seems to dwell; Gives a new cadence to each air they sing, While earth and skies with gratulations ring. Mean time, with glance ineffable, she looks On hills, receding valleys, groves, and brooks; Hills, where no flocks the eye excursive spies, That rise up in bleak prospect to the skies; Valleys, of all their flowery pride despoil'd, Their freshness wither'd, and their beauty soil'd; Groves, of their leaf-wove mantles rudely stript, Those pipes constring'd that once the moisture sipt; Brooks, foully swoln with many a sordid rill, The gross refuse of ev'ry slimy hill. But lo! soon as the sun-beam from her eye, Rapid as thought, is darted through the sky, The mantling trees in foliage green are clad, And fields with checker'd carpets overspread; While, from the manger and the stall dismiss'd, The herds domestic feed where-e'er they list. From ev'ry trunk shoots forth an infant stem, Each leaf bright-twinkling with a liquid gem. In silken convolutions wrapt from cold, Bud within bud, and fold inclosing fold, The tender bloom acquires its various glow, By sap nutritious suckled from below. Gentle and limpid flows each murmuring rill, And verdant rises every sloping hill. O'er the fresh lawn the crouded villa's spread, By business some, and some by pleasure led; Each with glad heart the ardent look returns, And each with social warmth of friendship burns; The laugh, the cordial shake, and rustic jest, With homely proof, their mutual joy attest, Unmingled joy, peace, hope, content, and ease, Each pleas'd alike, as each intent to please: While not the titled grandee passing by, With haughty air, attracts one envious eye. Such feelings, Spring, thy magic smiles impart, Such warm effusions of the grateful heart; Such nameless raptures thy soft charms create, Such gentle passions in thy train await! Not so when tempests, big with rain and snow, Discharg'd their fury on the world below; When seldom, from the windows of the skies, The cloudless sun look'd out with radiant eyes; When frost in chains the stagnate rivers bound, Naked the woods, and waste the barren ground; Or down from rock-brow'd mountains, white before, The torrent tumbled with impetuous roar; When round the fire the shiv'ring ring conven'd, Scarce social there from the dire season screen'd; When gloom-wrapt silence, dreary and profound, Thro' the mute groves hush'd each enliv'ning sound; When trooping flocks to friendly shelters throng'd, And night was to disgusting length prolong'd; While dreams, where Fancy runs her wild career, Gave superadded horrour to the year. Now fleets, long by tempestuous months confin'd, Expand their loosen'd canvas to the wind, To circulate the special wealth, betimes, Of inland kingdoms, or sea-border'd climes. The silk-worm's gaudy labours (to deride And swell the petulance of human pride) Gums, spices, costly gems, furs, pearls, ore, And all the treasures of vast India's shore, Lie ready rang'd, the merchant's promis'd right, To change their skies, when stars benign invite. Yonder fair Commerce wakes her sun-burnt crew, Gain's everlasting labour to renew. Along the beach in ardent throngs they croud, To stow the freight, or mend the broken shroud. For one thing some, some for another call, Ambition, duty, hope, inspirit all: While gales propitious, courting them away, Amongst the half-furl'd sheets and cordage play; Ocean and sky, at unknown distance met, Serene, seem to reproach their sails unset. Now Navies, with selected warriours mann'd, The boast and bulwark of some mighty land, (Such as croud Albion's warlike ports, to awe Contending states, and give Europa law), To purchase new, or old possessions keep, With shout tumult'ous launch into the deep; Their sails distent to ev'ry breeze that blows, And arm'd with Death's dread tubes, in brazen rows, Where thunders slumber, soon to wake aloud, Bursting explosive in a fiery cloud; While Heav'n's vast concave, whelm'd in smoke, resounds, And Ocean trembles through his watery bounds. Now o'er the plough the sturdy peasant bends, And whistles as the furrow he extends; The rooks oft scaring, that in ceaseless change, With wild kaw, o'er the glist'ning surface range; Now drags the harrow, with unwearied toil, Cross the rough ridges of the lumpy soil: Another scatters, on the mould'ring land, The oats or barley, with impartial hand; Around him pigeons form'd in airy ring, Shot the coy glance, or spread the frequent wing: While gentle weather, and unclouded skies, Make heart-felt pleasure sparkle in their eyes. In yonder vineyard, to the south expos'd, From blasting colds by lofty mounts inclos'd, The patient hind takes his commodious stand, To form and fashion all with curious hand; Some vines to prop, and others to arrange, As suns revolve, and months successive change: And, though his task laborious seldom staid, His cares he reckons amply overpaid, When the rich grape, in purple clusters hung, Swells to the eye, and sweetens to the tongue. Where yonder bed The conservatory or greenhouse. transmitted heat receives, And plants exotic spread their tender leaves, From sickly damps secure, and drenching show'rs, Another spends his task-allotted hours. The warmest earth he brings, and richest soils, Pregnant with salts and vegetable oils, Lest, long accustom'd to a gentler sky, Their famish'd roots should shrivel up and die. Let Winter boast not his resistless cold, Here Spring's eternal triumphs we behold. Amid his icy blasts, and hills of snow, When all's one undistinguish'd waste below; Here Vegetation, as in Summer-skies, Around her sees her infant offsprings rise. With all his implements of craft supplied, The peacock's honours, and the courser's pride, With wheel apt-fix'd, and rod of pliant wood, The Angler trips along in lightsome mood, And to some river's wonted margin goes, Where swells the pool, or stream o'er pebbles flows: Scorning the life of Sloth's voluptuous sons, Which idly in one languid tenour runs; On which Hope seldom shines with cheerful light, Dead to the brisker feelings of delight. Bending, in graceful attitude he stands, And all the glassy surface wide commands; Amid lone Solitude's romantic haunts, Where spreads the bramble, or the willow flaunts; Silent and calm; save when a tuneful thrush Salutes his pensive ear from hawthorn-bush. With equal poise, and well-adapted hand, He guides and vibrates his elastic wand; With gentle shake, in plumage not its own, (His basket careless o'er his shoulders thrown), Dances his fly, disguis'd for sudden prey, In all the frisks of apt-dissembled play: Then to the brink, exulting, on his hook, He drags the full-grown monarch of the brook; Or lightly tosses, arching over head, The smaller fry upon the sandy bed. Delighted thus he spends the jocund hours, When Morn, or Eve, distils the lucid show'rs; Thus (courts less innocent repasts afford) With unbought dainties loads his frugal board; Tastes the bland sweets of bloom-imparting Health, Often deny'd to Grandeur and to Wealth; Feels at his gladden'd heart her vital heat, And in each throbbing vein impulsive beat. Yet, o'er the rushy tract, or champain bare, The panting hounds pursue the timid hare; Or from the thicket, or inclosure, start The fox insidious, or swift-footed hart. Soon as Aurora peeps o'er eastern hills, His winding horn the early huntsman fills; Strait, from their kennel, pour the fawning crew, With ears deep hung to sweep the tainted dew; In tuneful uproar round their master croud, Aw'd by his stamp, as of his plaudit proud. Yonder apart awaits the neighing steed, With nostrils wide, and limbs well-turn'd for speed Elate in sprightly youth he paws the ground, And pricks his ears at each accustom'd sound. On ev'ry side casts his effulgent eye, As if his lord solicitous to spy. His lord arrives; big with disdain he looks, Curvets, and his arch'd neck in triumph crooks; Eager to give his airy soul to flight, Leap the fenc'd drain, or clear the quickset height. Active, meantime, while silence reigns profound, The beagles range athwart the covert ground; The furrow, sunny glade, or level park, Impatient for their master's well-known hark! Anon, the leader of the stanch-nos'd train Detects the vapour warm along the plain; Then, with superiour voice by all confest, Gives the expected signal to the rest. Full on the scent convene the cautious hounds, Forming a concert of melodious sounds; Which, with the loud halloo, the sportsman's crack, Oft-us'd incitements to the rival pack; The frequent rush of feet, and horn blown shrill, Mix, swell, and undulate from hill to hill: While ardent crouds, from each contiguous cot, Assembled on the first commanding spot, With ravish'd ears, and anxious eyes, survey The various fortune of the busy day. Before, the game, by frantic fear impell'd, Scours nimbly on, up the long rig beheld, Each back-shrunk ear, to stimulate her pace, Stunn'd with the noisy tumult of the chace. Yet at safe distance she her flight maintains, Preserves her vigour, though each nerve she strains; Her half-sunk spirits seem elated hence, And comfort lightly shoots across her sense. Short respite; soon her strength exhausted flags, Quick throbs her heart, and feebly move her legs. Fierce at her heels approach the growling throng, And smoking steeds in triumph stretch along. Now all, expectant of her sudden fate, Their speed and ardour by degrees abate. Each claims a merit in the helpless prize, Though early started, yet so late she dies. Her gait unsteady, wildly-carried eye, Turns oft repeated, and infantile cry, Her frequent starts, and half-returning breath, Presage her instant seizure, and her death. But shall the soft-ey'd Muse of bloodshed sing? Shall violence wound the chaste ear of Spring? Ye noble swains, with youthful transports warm, Whom rural scenes of recreation charm; Forbear an exercise, that best agrees With naked sences, and dismantled trees. The farmer now his finish'd task beholds, His hedges planted, and secur'd his folds; The gen'rous seed, his future harvest, sown, And round his parks defensive ditches thrown: Guard then his property, his wealth you share, Nor render useless all his prudent care. From pain and death a short cessation give, O let the guiltless hare and partridge live! Lest, when the year completes her golden round, No sports endear your stubble-tufted ground. Rather, in some late flood-swoln current set Your moss-fed bait, or spread your swelling net: From his retreat the famish'd pike to lure, Or in its wiles the speckled trout secure. But, if you would affect a nobler prize, Drag the huge salmon out, with blood-shot eyes; Now to the river's upmost depths he strays, While the broad curl his presence soon betrays. Here all your fortune, all your judgment try, Beneath the smiles of an indulgent sky; Nor fancy things repugnant should assort, But let each season have its proper sport. The End of the First Book. BOOK II. Now, thro' the fluid azure of the skies, Domestic bird, the fleet-wing'd swallow flies; Now, in some window, for a stated rest, With care maternal, builds her oval nest. Or cornice underneath; as if she came Mankind's protection from assault to claim. Nor let her confidence be ill repaid; Oh! be the ruffian hand relentless staid, That would, instead of proving her defence, Unhospitably drive her wretched hence. But shall the Muse be backward to describe The labours of the winter-dormant tribe? No; let their police teach the human-kind, That reason's not alone to man confin'd. Presumptuous man! so arrogantly wise, Proud of his high-born lineage from the skies! One to some water speeds, and wets her wings, Then on the dust the sprinkled moisture flings. Another mixes it with self-taught skill, Or bears the mortar on his loaded bill. Bit upon bit, with nice proportion plac'd, The mansion rises up in curious taste. Each emulous the growing work surveys, With ardent eye glanc'd round a thousand ways, And with fond art, their labours to beguile, Warbles in well-known twitters all the while. The pensile sructure rear'd in outward form, Cemented close, and firm against the storm, To furnish it for kindly warmth within, Another pleasing office they begin; O'er spacious fields unwearied wing their flight, Now lowly skim athwart, now gently light, To seize the down some friendly thorn detains, As left on purpose to reward their pains; The straw, the fleecy moss, the silken hair, Or feathers, lightly frisking in the air. With these they finish their commodious dome, Then, to relax, excursions make from home; High in pure regions nearer to the sun, Exulting, gay, their annual labour done; Or o'er some lucid pond, or gliding stream, Where insects hover in the setting beam. Not long; the mother soon, by instinct led, Returns to occupy her downy bed; Nor ever till her brood, with cautious wings, Taught and embolden'd first in feeble springs, For liquid air their dark confinements change, Idly abroad permits herself to range. Now, from these mansions Friendship ever quits, Where moaping gloom-brow'd Melancholy sits, Distrust, Want, Ague, Avarice, and Care, The miser steals, to breathe vertumnal air. Mansions, through which few rays transmissive shoot, Save from his chimney—seldom foul with soot, Or greasy shatter'd lamp's uncertain light, Kindled but in the dead opaque of night, If, haply, he should lift his timid eye, To see what thief, or sheet-cloth'd goblin's nigh; A greater spectre he (beheld by few) Were his lank form to bolt upon the view. From all this dismal group of horrours dread, Ghastly, as if just risen from the dead, The niggard, whom no beauties else could charm, No kindly passions, no soft transports warm; Ventures abroad, with felon's sneaking pace, To look his fellow-creatures in the face; Almost afraid to act, as if akin, Mov'd by some conscious principle within: While all shrink back, with diffidence and scorn, (As shepherds from the snake-infested thorn) Thus acting on Humanity's own plan, From such a monster in the form of man. Though not one tender social tie that binds Free gen'rous spirits, or ennobled minds, His little heart, as marble hard to melt, E'er for the period of a moment felt; Yet now, howe'er repugnant to his plan, Spring partly moulds and softens him to man. Watching his wealth, by locks on locks secur'd, Hunger and thirst in their extremes endur'd; Or counting o'er, with still enhanc'd delight, With harden'd fingers, and with aching sight, His figur'd pieces (thus preserv'd from rust) Of brighter-ting'd consolidated dust; Winter beheld him, all benumm'd with cold, Swath'd in a tatter'd blanket's scanty fold; Beheld him, though surrounded with his pelf, A poor and wither'd emblem of himself; Squalid his beard, his skin to parchment shrunk, Death-pale his visage, and his eye-balls sunk. But now the tardy current in his veins, Frozen erewhile, a brisker motion gains. On his dull organs Spring's resistless pow'r Acts—as on yonder reptile, yonder flow'r; What motive, reason, choice, or will, we call, (Man's privilege) alike deny'd to all. Hail, Queen of Seasons! thine's the potent charm Winter of all his rigour to disarm! Hail, Queen of Seasons! thine's the magic art To touch with life the Miser's torpid heart! A task much harder than, with spells unknown, To bend the oak, or mollify the stone. In some wide area, now, or spacious green, In social parties, nymphs and swains convene, Elate in youth, with expectation flush, And warm each cheek with health's carminian blush: While, from the saffron chambers of the west, The downward sun, ere he retires to rest, Brightens his parting smile, well-pleas'd to see Their mutual merriment, and harmless glee. Through the brisk measures of the mazy dance, They now, by turns, recede, and now advance; Enliven'd by the hautboy's sprightly sound, With nimble foot beat the enamel'd ground. Changing in airy trip from side to side, No graceful step, no attitude's untried, To fix the notice of the glancing eye, To paint the glow, or swell the conscious sigh. Each fronts the blooming damsel he admires, For whom he languishes in soft desires; For whom the song's compos'd, the nose-gay drest, To lose its beauties on he snowy breast; For whom by tinkling rills he loves to stray, Or through lone groves plod his sad dreary way; For whom in nice repair the arbour's put, And on the bark the dear initials cut: The glance, smile, sigh, squeeze, whisper, leer, discover The ardent, though the apprehensive lover; While she, in vain, with much dissembled art, Would hide the fond emotions of her heart; Though ev'ry female stratagem she tries, His eye soon penetrates the thin disguise. From all the stiff formality of state, The rights of kings, and factions of the great, The senator, now parted from the throng, Unbends his thoughts, intensely fix'd so long; While Solitude his placid hours employs, In learned ease to taste the noblest joys. Now Recollection ushers into view, Quick in her search, to her resemblence true, A croud of glorious objects, dear to fame, Which add distinguish'd lustre to his name: His projects plann'd with wisdom and address, Directed well, and honour'd with success, Beyond the royal, or the public hope, Give his enlarg'd reflections ample scope; Swell his full heart with patriot triumphs known, To Pitt, and some few kindred minds alone. On such the Prince's royal favour smiles, Whom no eye curses, and no tongue reviles. On such, as more than popularly great, The pray'rs and blessings of a kingdom wait. Fair Liberty, with such fond to resort, Leaves all the splendid circles of a court; Virtue, on whom a nation's weal depends, That skill which plans, and valour that defends; Glory and Victory, illustrious pair, To grace his recess, and his pleasures share. But not enamour'd of the year alone The grandee, by his crests armorial known; The man of traffic too his toil remits, And for a while his desk and counter quits; To the calm scenes of rural ease repairs, Purchas'd by a long train of anxious cares: While birds with music his arrival greet, And fields and groves exhibit ev'ry sweet; Additionally bright each sun-beam shines, To welcome him whom smoke so long confines, Confines in the eternal quest of wealth, Oft with the forfeiture of peace and health. The shepherd now, o'er flowery lawns at large, And richest pastures, tends his fleecy charge, Pleas'd to behold, around their bleating dams, In harmless frolic frisk the tender lambs; His little social cur attending nigh, To watch the flock with oft-reverted eye. Upon some eminence he sits him down, Undazzled by the splendour of a crown, And hums, with untaught languishment of air, Some sonnet on his not unconscious fair, The buxon dame, that in the lilied vale With milky nectar fills the balmy pail; Or, by the grassy margin of a brook, Stretches his listless length beside his crook; Where willows flutter to the whisking wind, And murmurs sooth to indolence his mind; Where hawthorns swell, where honeysuckles wreathe, And blossoms round perfum'd effluvias breathe. Where lime-trees, from Noon's piercing glance to screen, Throw over head a canopy of green. Where linnets warble with melodious throats, And finches chaunt their finely-quiver'd notes. All to invite the ravish'd shepherd's stay, Enhance his joys, nd drive his cares away. Calmly delighted with the well-known haunt, His breast disturb'd by no phantastic want, Along the flowery herbage, far from noise, Nature's pure guiltless pleasures he enjoys. Pleasures, to share but equal with the clown, Monarchs themselves might lay their sceptres down. Here, no absurd ambition to be great, To head a faction, or enslave a state; No scheme of vengeance, no invidious plan, To injure or deceive his fellow-man; No daring project to obtrude his name In Time's proud records, or the lists of Fame; Set his licentious passions all on fire, Distract his thoughts, or stimulate desire. Far other objects occupy his time, Which raise no tumult, and imply no crime. While scarce resolv'd what grateful to prepare, Or purchase, as a present for his fair; Whether a brace of pigeons, white as snow, Or burnish'd o'er with many a radiant glow; Of osier twigs a basket curious wrought, Or breast-knot at adjacent village bought, Whose figure some apt love-device conceals, On ev'ry sense a drousy languor steals. Partly awake, yet partly slumb'ring too, The landscape seems to swim before his view; Till sleep, at length, to all beneath the skies, In pleasing visions seals his weary eyes. Visions, where he beholds his plighted maid In all the florid charms of youth display'd; Such charms as health and innocence bestow, Beyond the toilet's artificial glow; Beyond what boasted washes can impart, The skin-deep varnish of cosmetic art. Such charms as seldom grace the court-bred fair, Though gems in constellations deck her hair; Though round her airy trips the self-fond beau, And coxcombs flutter on phantastic toe. Such charms as amply recompense the swain, Though unpossess'd (such triumphs to the vain) Of gilded equipage, and titles proud, To court the gaze and homage of the croud. Rest on, unenvy'd shepherd! and partake Those joys with-held from half the world awake, But joys, when sleep her opiate balm denies, Thy happier stars to thee shall realize; For guilt alone in dreams such raptures knows, As on his waking hours Heav'n ne'er bestows. Now, long in torpid indolence confin'd, Whilst Winter whistled in the northern wind, The bees excursive seek the sunny field, Where fresh-spread blooms the liquid honey yield. But, form'd of mechanism most exact, The waxen structure previous they erect. Plann'd in a range of corresponding rooms, Each architect a task apart assumes. Some ascertain the wideness, some the length, Some heave the burden with exerted strength. Some see the fret-work combs appended right, Some raise partitions to their proper height. Some polish and elaborate the walls, Some gather up what from the builder falls. Some ever and anon, with outstretch'd wing, The vegetable glue for cement bring. With mathematic elegance of art, The edifice complete in ev'ry part; The parent bee, that over all presides, In parties next the colony divides, From bud to bud extracting sweets to roam, Or joyous waft the luscious treasure home. The powder'd daffodil's madescent spoils, Renew'd by youthful suns and early soils; The border-planted thyme's strong-scented dew, Or fragrant hyacinth's, of ruby hue; To form those sweets that melt upon the lip, First of Spring's flow'rs court their enamour'd sip: While numbers ready at the entrance stand To lighten of their loads the homeward band; Hence, in distinct divisions to be laid, By others station'd farther in convey'd. For all alike in just allotment share, Delighted all, the profit and the care. No time seems long, no drudgery they shun, Once their appointed office is begun. No flow'r the humid fatness that receives, No blossom that expands its silken leaves, Or in the garden's variegated beds, Or where the purple heath luxuriant spreads; But gratefully bestows its yellow spoil, To freight their wings, and recompense their toil. Within, the monarch, far from vulgar view, Distinguish'd by his size, and burnish'd hue, With royal eye the curious work inspects; Here he adjusts, and yonder he directs; Or, strolling out, or latent in the cells, The drones, a lazy useless brood, expells. Happy republic! where with steady aim, (How few communities can boast the same?) No discontented voice, no party-feud, All ardently promote the general good. How happy Albion, did her sons unite, With blended counsels, and consociate might, To fix, thus truly, venerably great, The virtue, strength, and welfare of the State! A conduct sure more glorious, than embrace All creeds, all forms, all parties, for—a place; No matter how our projects brought about, If I but in, and but another out. A thousand wishes, not to be express'd, And soft desires, now warm the virgin-breast. Wishes her utmost caution scarce conceals, But all her manner undesign'd reveals. The glass consulted oft, with graceful wile, How to conduct the wafture of a smile; The solitary turn, and pensive cast, The keen sensation of the pointed jest; The heaving bosom, and half-notic'd sigh, The damask cheek, and languid-rolling eye; The roving glance, and neck of ivory bare, The loose attire, and negligence of air; All modestly, without the aid of art, Divulge the secrets of the female heart. Beware, ye boast of workmanship divine! Daughters of Beauty! darlings of the Nine! Beware of Love's insinuating wiles, Though he approach you with his softest smiles; Though accents, mild as gales favonian blow, From his bland tongue in smooth-turn'd period flow. Oh! guard against the lightning of the eye, Less fatal that which flashes from the sky. There undisguis'd the soul's soft movements play, Melt in a tear, or dazzle in a ray. There Love erects his crystal engine, whence He missive throws his weapons of offence; His rapture-wing'd, or anguish-pointed darts, With certain aim to reach unguarded hearts. Better on headlong precipices dance, Than meet the lambent eye's insidious glance. With base intentions, couch'd in artful speech, Now will the urchin flatter, now beseech. A thousand modes of love-lorn style invent, His faith, his truth, his love, to represent; Hopes, wishes, doubts, and fears, a motly train, That all together croud upon his brain; While tears, obedient to the well-feign'd call, Down his unmanly cheek officious fall. But turn aside, meet not his pleading eyes, Nor pity what you rather should despise. His words a latent poison will convey, The tempter speaks and looks, but to betray. Beware then, fairest forms the sun surveys! Beware of love! beware of vernal days! Of the fam'd Ides Of March., as ancient times record, So warn'd the Augur Rome's victorious lord; But Cæsar, not below himself to seem, Disdain'd his life by caution to redeem, And, proudly flush'd with fame too highly priz'd, The divination as a dream despis'd; Despis'd, and by the friend he lov'd so well, Wrapt in his robe, a mighty victim fell. But ye, whom Nature gently form'd to prove The melting, soft, impassion'd soul of love, Attend a moment to a friendly Muse, Nor your inspiring smile meantime refuse, While she describes the man, by Heav'n design'd The finish'd counterpart of womankind. Oh! were it no ideal picture sketch'd, But from surrounding life and manners fetch'd. The courteous Youth of modest worth prefer, Whom sense convinces when his passions err. Who knowledge ne'er esteems too early sought, Nor wisdom at too high a purchase bought. Of sweet deportment, unassuming air, His manners gentle, as his soul sincere. Who still concludes the best, and hopes the most, An unsuspicious heart his constant boast. Whom Prejudice, in her tyrannic chains, That worst of servile thraldoms, ne'er detains, If Reason, ever biass'd to the right, Discover objects in a fairer light. Who ne'er from sacred Truth in aught departs, Above mean Adulation's paltry arts. Not of superiour talents vainly proud, Though to excel his opponent allow'd; Nor, if addicted to an errour long, Averse to own his judgment in the wrong. Who can, though first in ev'ry youthful sport, With hoary heads in grave harangue consort. Not carried by the fashion to excess, But elegantly careless in his dress. Who can to men, in spheres exalted plac'd, Suit his demeanour, and adapt his taste; While those, to less superiour ranks confin'd, Share his assistance and protection kind. Who knows with spirit, when, and how, to act, Though in vain boasts by female softness check'd. Whom none with glaring faults or vices tax, Born to protect, not to insult the sex. Who gives to pelf its estimation due, Though open-purs'd and hospitable too. Deaf to Detraction's and Resentment's call, Attach'd to few, although polite to all. Beyond each sordid mercenary end, Cautious to censure, backward to offend. Who, delicate in word and thought alike, Avoids the jest that doubly seems to strike. To no dull set of rigid rules confin'd, Which meanly setter, not enlarge the mind; But acting on the more extensive plan Of universal charity to man. Who ne'er presumes his Maker's bolts to throw On each he impotently deems his foe; The little malice of a narrow heart, That of the whole but comprehends a part. Who hates in modes or trifles to be odd, Scorns a vain oath, and ne'er blasphemes his God. No tool of state, no Party's venal dupe, To fear too honest, and too proud to stoop; But, if his Country claim his proffer'd life, Prepar'd to die in the illustrious strife. Not elevated by a vague applause, Which caprice utter'd, or disgust withdraws. Whose eye with manly pity can o'erflow, And heart be melted at another's wo. In all his dealings scrupulously just, Firm in his friendships, steady to his trust. Neither in body or in mind diseas'd, On pleasing bent, as wishing to be pleas'd. If such a Youth, the glory of his kind, Accomplish'd thus in person and in mind, Approach you, with the tender voice of love, Though all the herd of coxcombs fail to move, Leave vain punctilios to the formal dame, Nor blush to own an honourable flame. For only with the man of these possess'd, Can Arethusa be completely bless'd, At least, as such alas! we seldom see, Like him depainted, finish'd in degree; Though Fortune, vain of her phantastic pow'r, Propitious smil'd upon his natal hour; Though pompous titles blazon forth his name, And proud escutcheons tell from whence he came. Riches from wants external may secure, But cannot peace or happiness ensure. Power, or force, may oft control the knee, But never can the heart, by nature free. The End of the Second Book. BOOK III. Now Contemplation, mark'd with brow serene, Fond of the cool retreat, and sylvan scene, Science, and eagle-pinion'd Genius, fraught With richest stores of elevated thought, Abroad through Nature take their ample range, Where objects infinite on objects change; Where, to the eye of angels and of men, Within belief, although beyond our ken, Omnipotence exhibits ev'ry hour, The mighty efforts of creative pow'r; On each inscrib'd the dread eternal name, Though silent all, proclaiming whence they came. Here, to ennoble, and instruct mankind In knowledge boundless as the godlike mind, Each with sublime solicitude essays To celebrate what soars above all praise! That first supreme Intelligence, who spoke, And light first-born from central darkness broke, Whence beauty, order, grace, proportion, springs, And all the fair variety of things! Not to a system's scanty bourne confin'd, With bolder flight, wing'd by the eastern wind, Each launches out into transmundane space, Where other orbs perform far other race; Through constellations of unnumber'd stars, Whose fix'd rotations no cross impulse mars; Through radiant files of planets, each a world, By hand divine in various orbits hurl'd: Where beings, of superiour rank to men, Inspir'd with higher intellectual ken, Rejoice, no envy, obloquy, or strife, In all the chaste delights of social life; Bless'd with their Maker's presence, like the pair That once breath'd Eden'd unpolluted air; Immaculate from Guilt's opprobrious stain, Uncheck'd by conscience, and untouch'd by pain; Adorn'd with Beauty's sentimental grace, No cares to cloud, no sorrows to efface. His presence—not tremendous to confound, Thick terrours inaccessible around; Not overwhelming in the blaze of light, Which angels view not with undazzled sight; Nor deep amid night's sullen gloom conceal'd, But in benignant majesty reveal'd. For who would dare Almighty pow'r confine, Stint Wisdom, or philanthropy divine, That, far in ether's circumambient void, Rais'd by a word, as by a breath destroy'd, Each pond'rous orb on its proud axis spun, To point its various regions to the sun; Grac'd by its equipage of worlds around, And compass'd wide by oceans without bound; Though of his works most obvious to our view, Nothing to what Omnipotence can do? Oft, by too complex boundless scenes ingross'd, In the bright maze of radiant wonders lost, Fancy exhausted intermits her range, Fond of gradations, or successive change; O'er Earth's inchanting objects casts her glance, Where simpler beauties smile at her advance, Yet, as originally form'd for man, Not perfect less in Heav'n's distinguish'd plan. Now, when from climates far remote return'd, Where late his lamp in mid-day glory burn'd, The sun, collected in his softest light, Pours his increasing splendours on the sight, Love's melting thrill of transport to impart, And chase the damps of sadness from the heart; Now should we quit the silken bed of ease, Where lengthen'd slumbers hurt us while they please, Soon as the Dawn, fair harbinger of day, Gilds the horizon with her early ray; While Night's thick shades, before her sacred eye, As fogs before the wind, disparted fly. Now, Music calls from ev'ry bush, “Arise, “The morning-star grows languid in the skies; “Deeper the east ting'd with carnation glows, “While you indulge in indolent repose; “Arise, and ere his journey is begun, “Be ready to salute the full-orb'd sun, “The full-orb'd sun, set to a thousand eyes, “Fond of his wonted visit to our skies; “Pleas'd to behold an active world astir, “Of Vice asham'd, and unenslav'd by her.” Now ev'ry godlike faculty and pow'r, Invigorated through the midnight hour, When slumber's opiate finger clos'd the eyes, Exults, expands, glows, and affects the skies. Through depths of study, sciences sublime, Motion, eternity, space, matter, time, Unbounded now the vagrant fancy's caught, In all the swift rapidity of thought. How sweet to visit some sequester'd bow'r, Or green recess, at this calm silent hour! Some arching alley's melancholy shade, Embroider'd meadow, or cool upland glade! To wander thoughtful o'er the wide-stretch'd lawn, Breathing the humid fragrance of the dawn! Or from some airy hill's aspiring height, Gilded with early beams of crimson light, To mark the gradual slow approach of day, And see how darkness gently fades away! How ev'ry object rises to the view, But dimly seen, wet with nocturnal dew! Or fir'd by some enthusiastic page, The envy, boast, and model of the age; With genius, taste, and solid learning fraught, To swell in conscious dignity of thought; Triumphant borne on Faith's exulting wings, Sceptres and thrones view'd as inferiour things, To rise above earth's sublunary clime, And think ourselves immortal for the time. Or, when we shift our visionary plan, Sink down apace, and dwindle into man; Where crystal-pointed rocks, and caverns wide, Responses quick return from side to side, Soft, from the hautboy's modulated throat, To swell the gentle, tender, thrilling note, Symphonious with a croud of warblers round, While distant hills return each pleasing sound. Such entertainments, not to few confin'd, But obvious to the bulk of humankind, True bliss to man's capacious wish impart, And wake the noblest feelings of the heart. Such entertainments keep his thoughts aloof From vice, that constant object of reproof; Calm all his passions (the reverse a crime) And leave no stupid vacuum in time; Assist his hopes on wing of fire to rise, And train him up an angel for the skies. Now simple, various, regular throughout, By a strong hedge of hawthorns fenc'd about, The Olitory in fair prospect ies, To drink the genial moisture of the skies; Where herbs unnumber'd (patriarchal fare) And roots their vegetable pulp prepare. There all along the pleas'd observer walks, Where artichokes erect their lusty stalks, Maturing, to accommodate the board, A dainty rich as culture can afford; Yonder, with tendrils creeping through the mold, Where cucumbers acquire their icy cold, Furnish'd with gelid juices for the treat, Amid the fervours of meridian heat. No ostentatious group of radiant hues, No gorgeous liv'ry here the florist views. No odours evanescent hence exhale, No dulcet dews to load the breathing gale. Kind Nature here is busied to produce Objects not form'd for pleasure, but for use. Hail, Parent of creation! Friend of man! How gracious, how benevolent's thy plan! Through heav'n and earth's unmeasurable space, Adapted to the season, and the place, Thy hand is ever open'd to bestow, Thy favours boundless as our wishes flow! On yonder gentle elevation, whence The checker'd prospect is beheld immense, With tincts and pencil ready in his hand, The painter occupies his airy stand; While Light's mild setting ray, no veil behind, Gilds each alluring object to his mind. Now to the laughing mead, or verdant hill, He glances round, still charm'd, delighted still, Where herds regale on herbage to their wish, And rosy milk-maids heap the fragrant dish; Now to the hamlet, at some distance seen, Embosom'd in a knot of beeches green; Or steeple glitt'ring to the pointed ray, Or mighty ruin leaning to decay; Next to some giddy rock's projecting height, Pendent o'er caverns dark as tenfold night; Or lofty bridge, whose ample arches stride Unmov'd o'er some fam'd river's rapid tide: Nor does the shepherd, with his trusty cur, Nor ploughman, as he turns the slanting fur, Nor avenue, nor vista, plac'd beside Some grandee's seat, the boast of titled pride; Nor colonnade, with Doric figures grac'd, Nor glass-roof'd stove in warmth congenial plac'd; Nor obelisk, whose Parian columns rise Magnificently towering to the skies; Nor temple built on some majestic height, To terminate the boundaries of sight; Nor angler playing his fictitious fly, Nor woodland hind, elude his curious eye. Now finish'd out in blended light and shade, First it, and then the landscape is survey'd; Alternate, lest some slighter fault escape, In site, in colour, symmetry, or shape. The strict review, repeated o'er and o'er, Serves only to enhance his joy the more. Pleas'd with the nice precision of his art, He marks the semblance just in ev'ry part, Delighted in such narrow bounds to bring The choicest beauties of the full-blown Spring. Nor shall Ardelia, in yon arch'd alcove, Espalier-walk, or vista-open'd grove, From empty Life's impertinence retir'd, Pass her sequester'd moments unadmir'd. There, on a sofa of sweet-scented flow'rs, While Spring seems to prolong the soften'd hours, With deep attention, and enraptur'd look, Curious she pores on some applauded book, Which genius animates, which sancy fires, Knowledge enriches, and chaste wit inspires. Or thoughtful muses through the solemn shade, Which no rude sounds or hostile steps invade. Far from the haunts of Faction and of Pride, Where Peace and Friendship, sisters twain, reside. Far from the glance of Envy, pale as death, Censure's bold tongue, and Slander's baneful breath. Where, tir'd with kings and parasites to mix, Delighted their abode the Muses fix; Seldom to such inspiring glooms pursu'd, In solitudes by mortals seldom woo'd. Where Melancholy's pensive train resort, And Meditation holds her silent court; Frequented, not by Passion's headstrong band, With flames or pointed daggers in their hand; But by each Virtue, gentle, modest, kind, Chaste inmate of the heav'n-attemper'd mind. Hither, to shun the scorching noontide ray, Ever with such associates fond to stray, Ardelia steals with transport from the throng, Where Mode and Int'rest settle right and wrong; Where Self, though often in a fair disguise, Her sordid arts is licens'd to practise; Where but a few avow, and that by stealth, The love of virtue, or contempt of wealth: While Folly laughs contemptuous at the man, Whose views extend beyond the present span, Who, from fix'd motives, not a transient mood, Dares nobly to be singularly good; For tyrant Fashion makes more errant fools, Who err by method, and offend by rules, Than who, from heedless levity within, Or from direct intention, grossly sin. While in one airy, vain, phantastic round, With Folly's many-colour'd garland crown'd, Flavilla lightly trifles time away, Her sole sublime ambition to be gay; To place a brilliant, or a patch dispose, Lest greater taste admir'd Aminta shows; To run through, on the celebrated tour, Civility's whole science in an hour; To boast a set of coxcombs at her call, Shine at a play, or flutter at a ball; At cards display her masculine address, Her ardour doubled, as her fortune less: While thus Flavilla learns the modern art, From all her native softness to depart; That female dignity which only can Secure the right of conquest over men; Ardelia, though the first of woman-kind, Alike for charms of person as of mind; Whom birth ennobles, Fortune greatly lifts Above the Sex by her peculiar gifts; To whose kind lot no common talents fall, Admir'd, respected, and belov'd by all; On Virtue much her ravish'd thoughts employs, And much partakes of her unenvy'd joys, Never, a partial boast almost her own, More throngly occupied than when alone: While zephyrs through the flaunting woodbines stray, As if in whispers their devoirs to pay; And overhead a choir of warblers sing, In sweetest strains, hers, and the charms of Spring. Nor wonder Virtue rivets her respect, While riches are beheld with fix'd neglect; For Taste and Self appear on Virtue's side, At once preserve our interests and our pride. The more true virtue we admire and love, Pleasing the more Spring's beauteous objects prove. In loving her what heights soe'er we gain, Insolvents still to Virtue we remain. For chiefly to the man, whate'er he be, Of rank pre-eminent, or mean degree, Who, taught in Reason's, not the Stoic's school, Keeps all his various passions under rule; Guards against future errours, mends the past, And lives each day as if decreed his last; Spring is the source, where-e'er he turns his view, Of pleasures ever exquisite, and new; Ambitious still to entertain the man, Who nobly acts on so sublime a plan; A plan, laid down by Virtue for her sons, Which parallel with life immortal runs. In ev'ry place an elegance he finds, Unnotic'd, unadmir'd, by vulgar minds; Unmark'd by Study's microscopic eye, That boasts such hidden wonders she can spy, Grand in effect, as in design immense, Beyond dull Vision's unassisted sense. The charms of structure, symmetry, and hue, So valu'd by the philosophic few, Are but a part (let kings with clowns condole) Of the divinely-complicated Whole. Newton, superiour to the herd of men, As, to a mortal's, is an angel's ken, Fathom'd Heav'n's depths unmeasurably far, Balanc'd in its bright orbit ev'ry star; And hence, in full magnificence of proof, While infidels, astonish'd, stood aloof, Deduc'd one first, supreme, almighty Cause, Acting by stated and eternal laws. But Virtue's son, though Learning's paths untrod, In ev'ry common instance finds a God. Finds Him, and with the raptures of a Young, When strains of Paradise flow'd from his tongue, (In Night's deep ear yet swell the plaintive lays) Rises to all the ecstasy of praise. He, with a title monarchs dare not claim, Unbounded views the Universal Frame, And, while his knees their prompt devotions pay, With humble confidence can boldly say, “For me the curtains of the sky were spread, “And sun, and moon, and stars in glory clad. “For me, while seraphims exulting sung, “In ambient air Earth's mighty orb was hung. “For me, the Seasons roll the mystic round, “In ev'ry change peculiar blessings found; “While grateful clouds drop fatness on the plain, “In lucid dew-drops, or in show'rs of rain. “For me, by sapient laws supremely right, “Alternately succeed the Day and Night. “For me, mild zephyrs cool the noon-tide heat, “And savages to forest-glooms retreat. “For me, while inoffensive lightnings glow, “Loud thunders break, and winds tumultuous blow, “To purge the vital fluid of the air. “Lest fogs and foul infections harbour there. “For me the hills with gentle slope ascend, “And verdure-painted vales beneath extend; “While gurgling rills in fluid crystal glide, “And cattle feast on Nature's flowery pride. “For me, secure from Want's increas'd alarm, “Beauty and Plenty spread their ev'ry charm; “To touch the springs of Transport various ways, “Or court the studious eye's elab'rate gaze. “For me, aloft the groves umbrageous shoot, “And ripen'd orchards bend with mellow fruit, “Where all the gay musicians of the Spring “From care and sorrow their exemption sing. “For me, the Deep's illimitable space “Swarms with its millions of the finny race. “For me, the mountain, in its precious veins, “Masses matur'd of ductile ore contains, “Or marble, boasted monument of fame, “To bear some mighty Hero's sculptur'd name. “For me, the diamond sparkles on the rock, “And coral blushes on its parent stock. “For me the jonquil elegantly blooms, “And roses lavish round their soft perfumes. “For me, the bees through scented blossoms stray, “And sip their aromatic breath away. “For me, the injur'd fibre to renew, “The healing plant distills its lenient dew. “For me, the vine's impurpled cluster swells, “And juicy melons fill their turgid cells.” But small were his possessions, if confin'd To blessings offer'd to all human kind. With less contracted amplitude of thought, With expectations more sublimely fraught, Thus may his heart dilate, his bosom glow, Thus his full raptures in big utt'rance flow; “When earth and skies to nothing shall decay, “And in their orbits planets melt away; “When Time, coeval with yon radiant sun, “His sand-glass of a thousand ages run, “Shall to Eternity his charge resign, “And worlds adjudg'd surround the bar divine; “For me, with gods and angels to be shar'd, “A state of bliss and glory is prepar'd, “Vast as my boundless wishes can extend, “And lasting, like my being, without end.” But see, what gentle objects court us hence, And spread their charms to captivate each sense. Shall we the pleasing summons disobey? What half so sweet, so elegant as they! The End of the Third Book. BOOK IV. Now in the broad parterre, or terrace-walk, Of various odour, drapery, and stalk, By stated turns the flowery tribes arise, Mantled in livery of a thousand dyes. For not to one too partial Nature fix'd, In colours with her choicest pencil mix'd, As months advance, alternate they display Their virgin beauties to the blushing ray; While all the watchful Florist's ceaseless care With indiscriminating favour share. Some round he shelters from intrusive cold, And borders with warm earth of fertile mold. Careful he marks, lest some mishap befalls, Where the rude insect lights, or reptile crawls; Where moles, to discompose his plots around, Run darkling their slant paths along the ground; Checks timely those that too luxuriant spread, And clears of noxious weeds the fragrant bed. Nor do what others lighter trifles deem, Such to the Florist's ready caution seem. Some he disposes in a fairer view, To heighten or their attitude or hue. On some, that love to drink in frequent show'rs, In drops effusive he the moisture pours. Some on supports he gently makes to rest, Or by their stature or their bulk opprest. From those removes each intervening screen, That more affect in sunshine to be seen. Then, with fond look and intermingled smile, His heart with rapture thrilling all the while, His finely-varied fam'ly he surveys, Not without some self-arrogated praise. Struck with the elegance of Art, that more Pleases, as oft examin'd o'er and o'er. Struck too with Nature's easy soft address, Beauty's flush'd touch, and Wisdom's fine impress; Whence infinite diversities we view Of conformation, foliage, and of hue; No narrow limits, or to skill divine, The charms of form, or wonders of design. One all in snowy white itself attires, Another the deep indigo admires. Some clothe in royal purple to be seen, Some full imbibe the em'rald's vivid green. Others apart their silken leaves unfold, Finely bedropt with crimson, or with gold. While numbers in the sapphire's lighter blue, Ethereal tincture, sip the trickling dew. Vainly would Art each soft gradation trace, Much less improve, or add one single grace. But not distinguish'd by their tints alone, What sumptuous taste in their apparel shown! Some dress themselves in suits of stiff brocade, And some in figur'd lutstring are array'd. Yonder a tribe of beauties, lately blown, Flaunt in loose tissue mantles round them thrown. And here arrang'd another class select Court our approach, in clouded velvet deck'd. While some, to decorate the splendid year, In satin robes of costly gloss appear. All, all is neatness, delicacy, taste, Nothing deficient left, yet nothing waste! Nature form'd each in her peculiar way, With her own pencil painted them so gay; In silks attir'd them wove in her own loom, And on them copious breath'd her own perfume. See! by the Season's mild return inspir'd, To rapt'rous heights of contemplation fir'd, With grand ideas, bold conceptions fraught, To the third Heav'ns, like him of Tarsus, caught; The Poet to some consecrated shade, Form'd to awake the fancy and to aid, Retires from all the little cares of Life, Its sordid pleasures, and ignoble strife; A world within himself, without its train Of Hydra evils, guilt, remorse, and pain. The fresh-blown beauties of the bright-ey'd May, That blush beneath the sun's enamour'd ray; The murmuring brook, that down from rocky hills In fluid silver copiously distills; The orangery ting'd with ruddy gold, In glass apartments shelter'd from the cold; The flowery meadow stretch'd in fair extent, The forest-nodding mountain's steep ascent; The grove's adjusted rows, that waving rise In leafy pomp majestic to the skies, Concealing, from broad Noon's officious glow, A thousand tender scenes that pass below; The garden's gravel'd walks, and order'd beds, Where flow'rs successive lift their painted heads; Amongst unnumber'd objects, each surpass'd In drapery and structure by the last, Beneath his magic pencil charm anew, With graces superadded to the view. Oft-times, by subjects more august inflam'd, He sings of monarchs and of heroes fam'd; Of patriots steady in their Country's cause, The mighty bulwarks of its rights and laws; Such heroes, kings, and patriots, as maintain Albion unrival'd empress of the main; Steals from the annals of each distant age, (A theft how glorious!) to enrich his page, The genius, learning, virtues, taste, and fire, Which men by instinct catch, while they admire; And, into various lights and graces thrown, With just selection, makes them all his own. As in a breathing wilderness of flow'rs, Relax'd by heat, and moist with new-fall'n show'rs, From bloom to bloom the bee industrious flies, Sips its choice sweets, and loads its little thighs. Love, kind affection, still innately fraught With candour, truth, and elegance of thought, With ev'ry soft refinement of desire, Sets his according numbers next on fire. Through all its doubts, perplexities, and cares, Or when it hopes, or wishes, or despairs; Its quick disgusts, its pride, and pert disdain, To meekness and submission turn'd again; He traces out the Passion's pleasing wo, With ev'ry aid Invention can bestow: And while he sings, in heart-affecting strains, Haply the tyrant in his bosom reigns. Haply, he feels (his lines the secret tell) Each soft sensation he describes so well, That sympathy ineffable, which binds Concordant tempers, and congenial minds. Else, whence the clouded brow, the tear-swoln eye, The look disconsolate, and bursting sigh? Why, else, to melancholy musings prone? Whence so solicitous to be alone? Elated now, now sunk beyond relief? Cheeks flush'd with rapture, or suffus'd in grief? But chiefly, when his Maker's glorious praise Fires his rapt muse, and claims superiour lays, Sublime he soars, above the vulgar throng, In all the conscious majesty of song. Faith's beatific views, Ambition's aim, Devotion's raptures, Love's seraphic flame, The flights of Genius, depths of Thought profound, The pomp of Style, and harmony of Sound; Now all conspire (but all how far below The mighty Theme!) to make his numbers glow. Paternal Deity! Creator wise! His footstool earth, eternal throne the skies! Who walks serene upon the tempests' wing, And lifts the islands as the smallest thing! In scales the everlasting mountains weighs, And holds in hollow of his hand the seas! Light like a dazzling garment round him spread, And awful darkness his pavilion dread! His voice the triple thunder of the sky! Lightning the vivid flashes of his eye! Earthquakes, convulsing Nature's frame abroad, The angry stamps of an offended God! What language not immortal can define Essential glory! majesty divine! These give unsully'd lustre to the year, And make the Spring so exquisite appear, Else one unbounded, one unlovely waste, Each beauteous object fled, each charm defac'd. These undiminish'd in the Godhead shone, Ador'd by angels circling round the throne, Ere Man arose from animated dust, Benign his aspect, as his form august; And shall, completed Heav'n's immense design, The wonder of new worlds eternal shine. But, after Fancy's eagle-flights were o'er, And heav'n-illumin'd Genius could no more; Thus, conscious all his best essays how vain, Might the rapt bard conclude his humble strain. “O great Original of life, and good, “And excellence! how little understood! “From first to last unchangeably the same! “I AM—thy dread unutterable name! “Eternal King of kings! Almighty Pow'r! “On whom depends Creation ev'ry hour, “Depends for support, beauty, order, life, “Else one vast scene of elemental strife! “Oh! pardon (angels fail alike with me) “This impotent attempt to sing of Thee! “How shall a worm Omnipotence address; “Range its confin'd ideas, or express? “To Thee can languid mortal praise extend? “Or infinite thought finite comprehend? “Yet, though retir'd on high from human sight “In mansions unapproachable of light; “Though angels thy creative footsteps trace “Through all the vast immensity of space; “If Majesty Supreme can stoop so low, “Or on a worthless worm a look bestow; “Oh be Thou ever, merciful and kind, “As Virtue finds Thee, present to my mind; “From sudden weighty trials to secure, “Which Nature is too feeble to endure; “Or, if permitted, that, without a tear, “Reason assisted may their pressure bear. “To Thee, before the first approach of light, “Dispels the congregated gloom of night, “Or welcome slumbers close my willing eyes, “May, like pure incense, my devotions rise. “If Fortune Let the reader be here informed, once for all, that nothing is meant by Fortune, in this or any other place, but such a crisis or revolution in human affairs, or in the circumstances of individuals, as seems immediately to result from the mere solly, caprice, and passions of mankind. In this sense the word Fortune, so often, and so indiscriminately used by authors, happily enough supplies the place of a tedious circumlocution. her proud favours should bestow, “And life's full cup with blessings overflow; “In Thee alone may I expect to find “An equable and unelated mind. “But if Heav'n's boon is a depress'd estate, “And poverty is my appointed fate; “May the pert tongue of Discontent refrain, “If it would boldly venture to complain. “To Thee, when my unwary footstep strays “In Guilt's broad path, or Errour's dubious maze, “May I with sudden recollection look, “Though to receive the timely sharp rebuke. “Oh! led amid the gloom by Wisdom's ray, “Soon, wand'ring, may I find the better way. “In each condition, ev'ry change below, “May I the end and motive learn to know; “The measure just, and consequence of things, “What flows from Prudence, what from Folly springs; “Thy sapient distributions still in view, “To give Thee all the glory that is due. “If Prejudices rule with tyrant sway, “Teach them the voice of Reason to obey. “If Passion domineers with wild uproar, “Speak, and again the Mind's lost peace restore, “To Thee, when sickness or distress draw nigh. “May I direct my help-imploring eye, “When all the boasted remedies of Art, “And friends themselves, in vain their aid impart: “And O! at that, perhaps not distant, hour, “When Health, impair'd in ev'ry active pow'r. “In the last spark of animation flits, “Glows out afresh, and languishes by fits; “When by a thread all human safety hangs, “And thought anticipates Life's parting pangs; “Father of mercy! graciously impart “Solace and comfort to my drooping heart! “In Thee Supreme, sole Conquerour of death, “O may I triumph with my latest breath!” How fitted, Spring, thy objects to impart Virtue's sublimest feelings to the heart! To elevate our hopes and wishes hence, And give a moral poignance to the sense! Religion, while she treads thy paths of flow'rs, Or in still glooms with Thee protracts the hours, Or where thy streamlets in meanders flow, Tastes those delights the world can ne'er bestow. The breast enthusiastic rapture fires, Something unknown prompts our enlarg'd desires; Quick on the wing of lightning Fancy's caught, Big images of things expand the thought; Unheard of wealth Imagination counts, Her pinnacle of fame Ambition mounts; We speak and look, as more than mortal men; Soar with an angel's eye, an angel's ken; When, gentle Spring, the magic of thy scenes Arrests the eye, and thrills along our veins. Who can behold Earth's beauteous offsprings round, See soft returning verdure clothe the ground, Hear jocund music warble from each spray, And mark the glories of the god of day, Nor find his bosom fir'd, his thoughts alert, Him niggard Nature form'd without a heart, Such ne'er improves on Education's plan, Though more than brutes, still something less than man. But hush—no satire shall our page deform, Spring's gentle reign but seldom knows a storm. Who would from her fair landscapes lift his eye, A dunghill, or its tenant worm, to spy? Let the harsh pen be emptied of its gall, Spring now but sweets and dews permits to fall. O bear me, Fancy, on thy fleet-wing'd car, To climes unknown, to regions distant far, Where vertical the sun his pow'r displays, Thron'd in refulgent majesty of blaze. Where Beauty her more splendid form assumes, And universal Spring eternal blooms. Where, nourish'd by earth's rich-concocted sap, While busy Science fills her outspread lap, Annual, the plant, the balmy herb's renew'd, With sov'reign virtues variously endu'd. Where rivers, famous in immortal song, On golden sands transparent glide along; Whose lofty banks, by woods pomacious grac'd, Blush with rich fruit, high-flavour'd to the taste. Where unctuous shrubs, and honey-dropping trees, And liquid gums, scent the favonian breeze, Where orange-loaded forests deeply glow, Spice-bearing groves, and citron orchards blow. Where, through the sunk recesses of the mine, Metals, for ages hid, resplendent shine, The virgin silver, of no vulgar pore, And gold's more highly-estimated ore. Where purple rubies flame in common stone, And diamonds, destin'd for some monarch's throne, Pure harden'd ether, light's concenter'd rays, Or singly sparkle, or in clusters blaze. But what avail their temp'rature of skies, And fertile lawns, where fruits spontaneous rise? Their myrtle shades, and vales adorn'd with flow'rs, Elysian walks, and amaranthine bow'rs? There Accidents put on a thousand forms, Diseases, famine, plague, vulcanos, storms. There Sickness takes her periodic range, While Generations ev'ry lustrum change; Endless Diseases croud her ghastly train, In languor sunk, or agoniz'd with pain; Consumption, with emaciated look, And pale-lipp'd Ague like an aspen shook. There Tyranny, curs'd with imperial sway, Beholds his millions abjectly obey; The titled peer, with his domestic clown, Alike beneath the terrour of his frown. There Earthquakes, while dread Nature makes a pause, Open enormous their expanded jaws, The superb temple, and the regal tow'r, Buried beneath, in one devoted hour. There Pestilence blows round her tainted breath, And riots in the horrid feast of death; Cuts off alike the grandee with his slave, And makes whole towns and provinces a grave. There the vast Wild unhospitable glooms, Where brutal life each dreaded form assumes; Where savages in furious pastime play, Or strew with carnage their insanguin'd way. There, brooding long portentous o'er the deep, Frequent abroad impetuous Whirlwinds sweep, While lightnings in excessive flashes glare, And smells sulphureous taint the fiery air, Thunders round rattle formidably loud, And torrents burst from each distended cloud. There, laying waste the labours of an age, The gorg'd Vulcano gathers all its rage; Or vomits forth, in seas of melted ore, Earth's glowing entrails, with explosive roar, Masses of pitch, rocks subterranean broke In molten fragments, wrapt in flame and smoke. Why then abroad stretch Fancy's eagle-wing, Flush'd by the vital spirit of the Spring, When homeward, no such terrours to alarm, Suns milder shine, and fairer prospects charm? When blessings of a more substantial kind, But by our wishes and our hopes confin'd, Each comfort that to sweeten life can tend, On ev'ry Season's grateful wing descend. Rather on Albion's celebrated coast, The boast of nations, as fair Freedom's boast, Which rocks in hostile range surround immense, Nature's own ramparts rais'd for her defence; Of healthful air, and cultivated soil, Where no fell pontifs threat, nor tyrants spoil; Which oceans from the Continent divide, Let me in bless'd security reside; To fur-clad Indians, Heav'n's sole boon to them, Left the resplendent ore, and costly gem. Religion, here, with mercy-beaming eyes, As when she came a seraph from the skies; Virtue, that such desert reflects on man, His arduous course of destin'd trial ran; White-mantled Peace, that hates the bloody scene, And Liberty, in sweet conjunction, reign. Here darling Property's to all ensur'd, By public faith inviolate secur'd, While each, as fancy, taste, or ease incline, Sits underneath his own embow'ring vine. Here, equal with his lord's, the vassal's cause Enjoys the naked sentence of the laws, While royal favour flows alike to all, At Virtue's suffrage, or at Merit's call. Better the meanest cottager, if free, Than the proud riban'd slave of high degree. Here Plenty opens her delighted hand, And scatters wide her favours round the land; The farm-toil'd Peasant happy with his lot, His garden-viands, and his low-roof'd cot; As in their purple robes, and chairs of state, The birth-ennobled, splendour-circled Great. Boundless as Nature, yet confin'd by rule, Here godlike Science founds her liberal school; Ravish'd beholds her fame-enraptur'd sons, Along whose veins the stream of genius runs, On wing excursive their bold flights pursue, And with a glance look all Creation through. Here Art, in her own native climate, thrives, Art, that but seldom Freedom's fall survives; Sees here, her busy millions plac'd around, With great success her vast inventions crown'd; Life polish'd, manners soften'd and refin'd, And by degrees enlarg'd the human mind. Here Commerce lavishes her choicest stores, The prime productions of remotest shores; No gentle gale distends the sheet unfurl'd, But wafts her all the treasures of a world. And here the Muses, with their gentle train, That in soft melting Elegy complain, Or rise to Epic, by Fame's nearest road, Take up with kings and heroes their abode. Hail, Seat of empire! mighty Albion, hail! Still may thy cause, and Liberty's, prevail. Still may thy fleets, the barriers of thine isle, While breezes waft, and suns auspicious smile, Beat back Ambition to her native home, As yonder surge retires in empty foam. And still may one of Brunswick's princely line Be both the darling of mankind, and thine, Till hoary Time himself, surviving all, Subdu'd, on his own broken sithe shall fall. —But scenes of sport now call the Muse away, Too much indulging the digressive lay. On yonder beaten tract, the village-swains, In strength robust, with youth distent their veins, While looks elate their various hopes proclaim, Croud from all quarters, candidates for fame. With Herculean sweepy whirl they throw, The pond'rous hammer, or the iron crow; With vigorous arm fling light the massy stone, Diversions fit for British youths alone; Pop the well-rounded quoit with dextrous pitch, Run the swift race, or leap the custom'd ditch: Each emulous, as if his all at stake, To gain the contest, or the lead to take. Ambition's not restricted to a crown, Kings have it but in common with a clown. Some, not detain'd enervate at the side, Plunge in the closing pool's translucent tide. Forward, incumbent on the clear expanse, With arms extended fearless they advance; While, at each sturdy stroke, in vapoury light, The tumid wave breaks refluent on the sight: Or down some avenue's protracted length, With practis'd sweep, and full-exerted strength, Each fellow'd with his brawny-limb'd compeer, The glowing bullet roll in fleet career: Others, as kings of old us'd to contend, With happy aim the bow elastic bend, While forth impell'd the rapid arrow springs, And whizzes up on well-proportion'd wings. These are the Season's periodic sports, Here Health, with all her florid train, resorts; Here pale Consumption's wasted form's ne'er seen, The Gout, Catarrh, the Gravel, or the Spleen. Here all in native gaiety appear, A temper sympathetic with the Year. Such are the exercises that bestow The strong-brac'd sinew, and the ruddy glow; Lengthen, with blessings fraught, the narrow span That circumscribes the stated life of man; Blessings, when, haply, men their loss deplore, But Heav'n, and Whytt, and Temp'rance can restore. Blessings, alone by active Virtue won, From hardy sire transmitted to his son. Such scenes of tranquil life, and rural ease, Such scenes, in their own nature form'd to please, Immortal poets sung, renown'd of old, In happy ages fondly styl'd of gold; When men their blissful hours in vineyards spent, With Nature's unextorted gifts content; Ere Rapine and Oppression warn'd mankind, In common league, for common good, combin'd, To delegate to one imperial sway, Whom all with willing suffrage should obey. Such scenes, by ev'ry mild and gentle art, To all the finer feelings mould the heart; Add swiftness to Time's care-retarded wing, And give a native elegance to Spring. Teach that instructive lesson, seldom known, Though in importance it outweighs a throne, That Happiness basks not in Fortune's blaze, Nor to the Great her ready visit pays; But with the shepherd shares the lowly cot, How simple, how obscure, regarded not. Blush, ye that boast a garter or a star, Behold a peasant, more ennobled far. Well might a tear the Grecian hero shed, To dim the starry circlet round his head, For, short of happiness, he knew no rest, Though he a world in proud survey possest. Hail! Happiness, fair native of the skies! What is it thy celestial name implies? Is it for wise, for excellent to pass, Or heaps of useless riches to amass? Is it to live in ease, exempt from care? A haughty monarch's partial smile to share? Is it to flutter with a titled name, Or swell elated by a breath of fame? Is it to range through Nature's boundless space, The endless laws of Gravity to trace? Studious o'er books with midnight lamp to pore, And Learning's age collected funds explore? Is it to weep at Pity's soft command? Or stretch forth Charity's assistant hand? Is it a form, with ev'ry beauty grac'd? A set of features, regularly plac'd? Is it a temper's accidental cast? A heart by Nature's finest touch imprest? Is it the spirits mov'd in brisker flow, And softly agitated to and fro? Is it Life's salient springs adjusted right, And wound up gently to a certain height? No; to the foul opprobrium of mankind, Thy sacred name remains yet undefin'd. Nought that results from an external cause, Which chance bestows, or accident withdraws; Nought to a rank confin'd, in fame or gain, Which few can merit, fewer far obtain; But what, as dews from heav'n promiscuous fall, Flows in a constant equal tide to all, To all alike, that govern, or obey, Of Thee a just idea can convey. Let then fantastic Lovers dream no more, And all their schemes Philosophers give o'er: An humble spirit, a contented mind, To ill, by choice, averse, to good inclin'd, In ev'ry change of circumstance the same; Comprise in apt epitome thy name. The End of the Fourth Book. BOOK V. Now swells the full-grown orchard on the sight, O'erspread with blossoms delicately white; Or streak'd with crimson's richly-painted dye, With saffron tinct, or glow of evening-sky: A wilderness of soft perfumes, more sweet Than in Arabia's gummy forests meet; Than what the sun's prolific ray exhales From spicy groves, and fragrant Indian vales. Here pear-trees in capacious shade extend, Soon with their juicy progeny to bend. On lofty branches there, luxuriant spread, The apple shows its cheeks of burnish'd red. Along that wall, the apricote and peach Bask in the heat, and soften to the reach; And yonder plums, turgescent to the view, Fatten their luscious flesh of cloudy blue. How deep, how solemn spreads each tree around, Bent in a thousand arches to the ground! Mingling their branches in diffusive shade, Scarce can Noon's brightest glance the gloom pervade. How comes the sadly-pensive mood unsought! How melancholy steals upon the thought! Who can the half-spontaneous sigh refuse? Who can resist the urgent call to muse? When we would thrones and diadems despise, And on all human grandeur shut our eyes; Peep at Eternity from Time's dark brink, Converse like angels, and like angels think; Better and wiser when we wish to be, From endless trials, snares, and follies free; To such Retirements, with becoming awe, Oft let us from a guilty world withdraw. Here might some Bard, whose hopes immortal tow'r Above the poor possessions of an hour, By Faith's sublime enthusiasm fir'd, And long of Life's unmeaning sameness tir'd; Thus, with each thought on happiness intent, Might he indulge his soul's enamour'd bent. “Oh could I, Happiness! seraphic maid, “To whom the universal vow is paid! “With Thee retire to this sequester'd spot, “By all, save by a faithful friend, forgot; “A friend, whose joyous countenance and smile “Can soften care, and pain itself beguile! “Through solitude diffuse a cheerful ray, “And gild those glooms unvisited by day; “Not Siren Pleasure, with her fair pretence, “Nor Fame, nor Grandeur, should allure me hence. “Science should teach me all her sacred lore, “And with me Fancy on her pinion soar. “Study exhaust each genius-kindled page, “The treasures and researches of an age. “Sweet Meditation, heav'n-descended maid, “Should lead me through each solitary shade; “Of thought intranc'd ecstatic flights inspire, “And with her transports set my soul on fire. “Beneath the spread of some romantic tree, “(All places, cherub! are alike to thee) “Where the fond bee with tube inserted clings, “Or buzzes round on deeply-loaded wings; “Where grasshoppers chirp their incessant note, “And the lone robin strains her mournful throat; “On Nature's verdant lap, should balmy sleep “Each willing sense in soft oblivion steep, “Brought gently on (a boast unknown to Wealth) “And render'd sound, by exercise and health: “While zephyrs scatter odours from their wings, “The sweets quintescent of each flow'r that springs; “While Twilight draws her sable curtain round, “And Silence guards the consecrated ground. “Peace should conclude the day, as it began, “And Virtue form the angel on the man. “Each hour to Heav'n should bear some fond request, “Not to be mighty, or of pow'r possest; “Not to claim kindred with a splendid name, “Or live recorded in the rolls of fame; “Not for pre-eminence in rank or style, “A monarch's favour, or a courtier's smile: “But hopes more elevated, less confin'd, “More prompt devotions, and an humbler mind. “And when Time's measur'd sands were gradual run, “And Life its strangely checker'd task had done, “Sustained by mighty Faith's supporting arm, “No guilt to sting, no terrours to alarm; “Pleas'd should the spirit wing, from earth set free, “Its flight to Heav'n, O Happiness! with thee.” While others form the visionary scheme, Of castles in the air phantastic dream; Wrapt in the love of mercenary gold, In wretchedness and misery grow old; On Pleasure's wanton lap in dalliance lie, And drink swift poison from her darted eye; His moments thus the virtuous Bard employs, And Spring far more than vulgarly enjoys; Flatters no statesman, by base faction rais'd, Himself dishonour'd, as his patron prais'd; Maligns no worthy venerable name, With parts, alas! that damn him into fame; Takes from himself no image of the age, Then to hell sinks it with a devil's rage: But, unseduc'd by pride, caprice, or pelf, Thinks greatly each man better than himself; While Nature feasts with fruit his vagrant eye, Soon at his feet in luscious heaps to lie; At once delights him, Nature's true sublime, With Plenty and with Beauty in their prime. Breathe mild, ye winds! ye Zephyrs! gently fan, Nor disappoint the sanguine hopes of man; Your softest dews, ye skies! benignant show'r, Nor scorch the folded bud, or infant flow'r: That when Autumnal suns maturing shine, Little inferiour to the purple vine, May flow the limpid current from the press, And sparkle highly-flavour'd in the glass; That mellow fruitage, in profusion stor'd, May long a delicate repast afford, When Winter's joyless solitary reign Extends through widow'd Nature's bleak domain; When, round the clean-swept hearth, and blazing fire, The social circle from the Storm retire; Regardless how it sweeps with hostile roar, And heaves the spumy billows to the shore; Or how the torrent, rapid and profound, With rous'd-up fury smokes along the ground; While gloom primæval clouds the face of day, And ruin big marks their tumultuous way! From harm secure, with grateful calm content; Prepar'd to taste the present blessings sent; Such blessings Nature fails not to provide For modest wishes, unenlarg'd by pride; Happy that soon, these surly horrours past, The rain-charg'd tempest, and the icy blast, While Winter each in frightful caves confines, And to her smile the willing world resigns, Spring, usher'd in by Music's gladsome strain, Will light exulting on the conscious plain; Furnish'd with all that genial climes bestow, To bless the fond expectant world below. Furnish'd—but let the eye around be thrown To see those treasures Spring may style her own. Waft me, Imagination, on thy wing To some sweet wood-encircled haunt of Spring, Along fam'd Tweed, or fairer-border'd Clyde, Where she delights with Beauty to reside. Already has the Thames, imperial stream! Unrival'd been the Muse's boasted theme, Wafting the wealth of distant worlds along, By Twick'nam's bard immortaliz'd in song; Oh could I (but the forward wish is vain) Reach his surpassing elegance of strain, Not Thames alone should be consign'd to fame, Clyde should the secondary honours claim! Warm'd by the Season's vivifying ray, Light, Muse, on airy pinion bear away, To trace its current, various as it flows, And verdure and fertility bestows. First, in a sheet of water broad and deep, On osier beds each murmur fast asleep, It swells immense, in liquid mirrours seen, Ashes and pines adown each margin green, Or lime-trees in full arching rows prolong'd, Or pendent rocks with thickets wildly throng'd: Headlong anon, rous'd from its languid flow, Where some huge precipice o'erlooks below. The gulf profound, and ragged shadows frown, It dashes, whirls, and smokes, and thunders down; Till, in a smooth expanse compos'd again, Onward it sweeps majestic to the main. Here shoots with wing'd velocity along The salmon, monarch of the scaly throng; Here trouts unnumber'd skim their fluid way, Plunge far below, or near the surface play; Fierce-darting, here the tyrant pike resides, While deep in mud the eel elapsive glides; Often in nets by sturdy peasant haul'd, Or on the angler's bloody hook impall'd. Nor shall the Muse, transported as she roves, Pass by, Dalzell! One of the finest seats, for natural beauties particularly, on Clyde, belonging to Archibald Hamilton of Rosehall, Esq; thy venerable groves. Thy fields, such as romantic fancy feigns, Where golden Plenty ever smiling reigns. Thy orchards, loaded with Autumnal fruit, Thy nurseries, where woods in embryo shoot. Thy noble vistas, grottoes, and cascades, Thy upland lawns, and sun-expanded glades. Thy long, dark avenues, at distance seen, Forming o'er head arch'd canopies of green. Thy temples gilt, Invention's boast, and Clyde's, Thy hot-beds, where through winter Spring resides. Thy rich inclosures, where the stately deer Majestic roam, or sport in fond career. Thy flow'r-plots and thy gardens richly drest, On which the genial powers of Culture rest. Thy shady arbours, alcoves, green retreats, The Lover's darling haunts, and Muse's seats; Where pensive Meditation oft retires, Stretches her wing, and kindles all her fires; While, as she takes her visionary walk, Around her forms ethereal seem to talk. With her to spend the summer-lengthen'd day, Each passion calm, and ev'ry care away, Here would I envy not Arcadian swains, Tempe's fam'd valley, nor Hesperia's plains. Authors should too employ my choicest time, Correct their diction, as their thoughts sublime. Authors, whose pleasing lessons daily read, Better the heart, while they inform the head; Still, as by magic, Passion's inbred storm, And portray Virtue in her comeliest form; Not such as drag down Reason from her throne Or make her reign unaided and alone; Both ill extremes, and foes to humankind, That warp the judgment, and debase the mind; Where fatal doctrines charm in fair disguise, Oft unperceiv'd by superficial eyes: Amid a glow of subtile language, still By taste selected, and arrang'd with skill, Errour conceal'd from vulgar notice lurks, And sure her darling scheme, though slowly, works. As in a bed of flow'rs, or thorny brake, Fold within fold lies hid the crested snake. Who would affect to mingle with the croud, Form'd of the selfish, insolent, and proud, And not prefer the Country's tranquil joys, Where Nature always pleases, never cloys? For smoke, condens'd in many a pitchy wreath, The sweetness of untainted air to breathe. For narrow streets, by quick-ey'd Fancy led, To roam through meads, in lilied verdure clad. For noise incessant, from each pensile spray, To hear the tuneful songster's jocund lay. For vain distinctions and phantastic show, Those cares Contentment glories not to know, Nothing save rural elegance to see, What Virtue is, what Grandeur ne'er can be. Did angels from their blissful seats descend, Their time below in Paradise to spend, Our heav'nly guests would not in courts abide, But near a wood, or by a fountain's side. Happy the man, to whom a well-spread board An ample Independence can afford, Leisure to study, quiet, peace, and ease, Born rather to be pleas'd, than others please; A little sov'reign, though without a crown, Courted his smile, nor dreaded less his frown! Spring opens all her treasures to his view, To be admir'd with more than common goo. Labour and Want (unhospitable twain) Chill not the current in Life's salient vein; Nor damp the spirits, else of sprightly cast, Nor check the nobler passions of the breast; Nor blunt the fine Sensation's tender edge, Which man's chief pride philosophers allege. Thus some fair shoot, in spreading foliage gay, Drinks youth and vigour from the golden day, Because no worm gnaws at its root below, Colds nip above, or forky lightnings glow. A taste, improv'd by Education, finds Pleasures where none appear to ruder minds; Scenes, where the croud but few attractions see, Affect it in an exquisite degree: As telescopes, the finer ground, convey More striking beauties by the visual ray; Or magnets, as prepar'd the more exact, Objects around more forcibly attract. This is her privilege; nor this alone, Wealth others yet more glorious calls her own. Her's is the pow'r, from Heav'n descends the will, The famish'd mouth of Indigence to fill. To over-rule the casts of Fortune's wheels, And mitigate the pang Affliction feels. The cares of injur'd Virtue to beguile, And make the haunts of Desolation smile. With pious hand the frequent tear to dry, That gushes down from Sorrow's humid eye. The naked limbs in raiment to unfold, Expos'd to shame, and all benumm'd with cold. Thus to partake their pleasures, heighten'd too, No painful sense of obligations due: For he whose bounty well directed flows, Enjoys the very blessings he bestows. As bodies give to others, though at rest, That same first motion on themselves imprest; Or as the clouds in exhalations gain, What they expended in Vertumnal rain; While Virtue dares not to decide pretend, Which party most indebted in the end. Such kindred sentiments would Spring impart, Softness of look, and gentleness of heart; Simplicity of thought, a taste refin'd, Feeling of soul, and sympathy of mind. For view through vegetable life her plan, In guile how little she resembles man! All her productions, to enrich the year, Simply and fairly are what they appear. I wrong her sure—minutely them explore, She promis'd much, but she bestows us more. The flow'r excells in elegance of hue, Ev'n to the distant superficial view; But to its velvet leaves the glass apply, Still richer glows the variegated dye! The herb and plant how botanists admire, Though furnish'd only with plain green attire! But let the chymist exercise his art, Extracting the rich essence of each part; What words can paint our gratitude to Spring, While health we title a momentous thing! Though much on her employ'd the sylvan strains, Much of her beauties still unsung remains. But who can count the pearly globules Morn Sheds infinite on ev'ry twinkling thorn? Or who arrange with unbewilder'd eye The stars that cluster through the midnight sky? Hail, blooming Spring! essential Sweetness, hail! Thy fragrant breath perfumes the lenient gale. Thy magic smile, amid the Tempest's strife, Can wake the torpid glebe to verdant life; The harden'd soften, the compact expand, Moist from thy dews, and by thy zephyrs fann'd. Not central cold its genial force can stop, Though Winter's frosts arrest the pendent drop. By it the sap, protruded to the root, And juices, long confin'd, fermenting shoot; Through twining tubes in brisk meanders play, And life and vigour to the top convey. From hence deriv'd the vegetative pow'r, The turgid stem, herb, plant, and dew-fring'd flow'r. Hence all the various growths that Earth o'erspread, Mantled in verdure, and by ether fed. Hence Summer to the thickest shades retreats, And coolest haunts, to shun the sultry heats; Hence ripens, underneath her radiant eye, Refresh'd by dews, that trickle from the sky, The fields, thick-waving in luxuriant grain, And vineyards flush'd with purple's richest stain. Hence Autumn gathers in his fruits mature, From hostile winds and accidents secure; While the glad hind, exulting in his store, Content, forms not a distant wish for more; His rosy children prattling on his knee, Their little sweet endearments fond to see; They too delighted to behold him smile, With aspect pleas'd, and brow relax'd the while. Hence, the full Year with golden plenty crown'd, The liberal glass, in bumpers hurried round, Inspires each gladden'd heart, from cares set free, With honest transport, and facetious glee; No red-cheek'd dame forgot, with artless mien, And untaught step, that trips the daizied green. Hence all that lavish imagery thrown From Nature's lap, which Fancy names her own. Hence too whate'er to studious ease inclines, Exalts the genius, or the sense refines; Those objects, in successive fair display, That wake to harmony the Poet's lay; Excite fond pictures in the Lover's thought, The Lover still intensely musing caught, Venting, where some congenial shade surrounds, His love-sad anguish in pathetic sounds. The End of the Fifth Book. BOOK VI. From crouded villas, and frequented ways, Unhappy youth! now pensive Damon strays. Damon, whom Love to lasting sorrow dooms, To pathless haunts, and solitary glooms; Where echoes, sympathetic with his wo, Where crystal brooks, that murmur as they flow; Where lonely birds of melancholy throat, That piteous swell the sadly-pleasing note; Where flutes that round to plaintive music wake, Where grasshoppers that chirp amid the brake; Where bees that hum, or to the blossom cling, Where beatles, wheeling round on drony wing, Where zephyrs, sighing through the branchy trees, Where ev'ry sound he hears, or object sees; Confirm, but by some strange mysterious pow'rs, The settled sadness on his brow that low'rs. Long ill-requited had he worn her chains, That reigns the scornful Beauty of the plains; Oft, in such language as express'd his flame, Trembling would he accost the haughty dame; Oft as she pass'd, no kindly word to say, In pleasing anguish look his soul away. But all in vain; her heart would never melt, No thrill of passion ere her bosom felt; With angry glance, or quick-averted eye, Would she retire, disdaining to reply. Once, from a secret eminence he spied Himself unseen (Love's ever watchful-ey'd) His fair one trip across the nether lawn, Her cheek, the roseate blush that paints the dawn. Spring strow'd with fragrant flow'rs her smiling way, And zephyrs wanton'd with her loose array; While birds, her steps delighted to detain, Pour all their softest melody of strain. Enamour'd round her lovely eyes she threw, In many a glance, on the surrounding view, Where Spring's gay forms their sweetest looks assume, In naked pride of noon-unfolded bloom; Pleas'd with the partial self-attested truth, That all smil'd emblems of her charms and youth. But had she guess'd what conscious eye beheld, To her no more the landscape had excell'd. Lightly the grass her hasty footsteps print, And no delay her motions seem to hint. Howe'er by others view'd, in Damon's eye, Our Fair seem'd not to walk, but almost fly. Ill-omen'd speed, yet hoping half he err'd, He knew to somewhat not his meed referr'd! Some foreign care her thoughts seems to employ, And ev'ry step deprives him of a joy. No wonder Damon gaz'd with dumb surprise, With all his passions crouding to his eyes! Rarely the eye-lids of the blushing Morn Ope on a maid whom fairer charms adorn! In spiral rings her hair disparted flows, And half her neck of milky whiteness shows; Her garments, loosely floating on the gale, Would hide her gentle limbs, but kindly fail. New glory, in his fond deluded eye, Seems to illumine all the cloudless sky; In beauty ev'ry object to surpass, As conscious of the presence of his lass. Each sound, each accent, of a pleasing kind, He partial deems to catch her ear design'd; To call her easy gracefulness of air, Her bloom, her shape, her looks, beyond compare. A fuller gale of fragrance from the ground Seems to diffuse its wafted sweets around. Yet other feelings too succeed in turn, Destin'd to freeze, like Hecla, and to burn. What strange sensations vibrate in his eye! How heaves his bosom with the lab'ring sigh! What doubts, what fears, (to hold him in suspense) Rush in disorder on his troubled sense! How Recollection her fell pow'r employs, To dwell on former scenes of blasted joys! To bring each disappointment into mind, When all her looks and answers were unkind; Hiding no proof officious from his view, That can the anguish of his soul renew; O'ercloud his brow with the dark gloom of care, And sink his baffled wishes in despair! Yet through the chaos of his thoughts, from far Hope faintly gleams, like some auspicious star. Oft he resolves aside reserve to lay, And throw himself abruptly in her way, One last effort to melt a frozen heart, That mocks his passion, and derides his art. But soon his coward resolution flags, His courage fails him ev'ry step he drags. He dreads to try, by one decisive test, What wretched renders him for life—or blest. Too prudent fear—for ah! ill-fated swain! This trial had like others prov'd in vain! She chanc'd, as passing negligently by, Where Damon stood, to cast her lifted eye. Nor needed more—with frown-o'erclouded look, And sudden turn, a by-mark'd path she took. Down his swoln cheek the tear effusive dropt, And stupid grief his pow'r of utt'rance stopt— At other times, oft to the clear expanse Would he, erect in conscious pride, advance. There, in a faithful mirrour, he beheld, In what his person fail'd, in what excell'd; His manly limbs how turn'd, his sinews strung, His shape how graceful, how his shoulders hung; What comeliness of aspect might inspire Some gentle female bosom with desire. Returning lightsome from the fond survey, Oft to himself in silence would he say, “Sure, though as cold as Winter's native ice, “This form of mine some Virgin might entice, “Else has the crystal element hard by, “Flatter'd poor Damon, and deceiv'd his eye! “Yet do the flow'rs, its margin that compose, “By the resemblance half their beauties lose. “Shall it a heighten'd image then convey, “And flatter love-sick shepherds more than they? “If thus beguil'd, where-e'er his footsteps go, “Still in despair may Damon's sorrows flow.” Thus, while the Hours on heavy pinions move, He lingers out a life of hopeless love; Alike forgot, where fellow-swains convene, The sprightly dance, and gambol on the green; His crook neglected, mute his oaten reed, And lonely flocks untended left to feed. But see where Strephon, happy shepherd! laid Beneath the umbrage of a beechen shade, With pipe and song the tedious time beguiles, While pleas'd around him blooming Nature smiles. No vulture on his vitals inly preys, No clouds obscure the sunshine of his days; He gives each sad reflection to the wind, His flocks all thriving, and his mistress kind. One summer's day, beneath the noon-tide beam, Strephon, return'd from bathing in the stream, Sought the cool windings of a devious wood, That well accorded with the Lover's mood. Here ev'ry noted songster, warbling round, Ran through the softest melodies of sound. Here gelid breezes fann'd the sultry hours, Lavish of sweets from incense-breathing flow'rs. Here Silence fixes her retir'd domain, Far from the proud, the wanton, and the vain. Here Melancholy's tardy footsteps range, With countenance scarce Spring herself can change. Here something strikes him, speech but ill explains, That sends an unknown rapture through his veins, Conveys, though Nature only knows from whence, Strange images of transport to his sense; Which all, howe'er confus'd and wild they mix, Alone on one beloved object fix. Something, of secret instantaneous pow'r, Nor to a mode restricted, nor an hour, That a sad-pleasing flow of temper brings, And wakes the Fancy by unusual springs. Nor does this charm the soften'd soul to melt, This nameless impulse only to be felt, Affect the doubting anxious Lover more, Than Him, whose cares and vague distrusts are o'er. Each somewhat of a sweet despondence finds, A languishment, that soothes but Lovers' minds. Each too is gratified, yet nothing gains, Though what the one delights, the other pains. Thus Strephon, though Ethlinda kind as fair, With Love's bland voice had bade him not despair; Amid the rueful solitary shade, Conceiv'd a joy from each thing he survey'd; Yet sighs his inward discontent betray, His Charmer still protracts the happy day, When yonder sun shall meet his eager sight, To see their persons with their hearts unite. Not long the grateful covert he enjoy'd, On recollected proofs of love employ'd; What mingled sweetness in her features reigns, Where Beauty seems to speak what Virtue means; Where her fine temper's seen, beyond a guess, As objects shine reflected in a glass! Not long, on such endearing thoughts intent, He thus indulg'd his fancy's pleasing bent, How kind his angel last, how soothing spoke, When from a secret copse these accents broke, Which through each sense like subtile lightning thrill'd, And all his soul with sudden tumults fill'd. “O Strephon! beauteous as the dawn of day! “Blooming as Spring! as radiant Summer gay! “Sweeter than odours from the new-mown vale! “And milder than the softly-breathing gale! “O lovely youth! thy charms, unknown to art, “Attract each eye, and captivate each heart. “In vain, alas! Ethlinda's virgin pride “The partial wishes of her breast would hide. “No shepherd in the festive dance I see “Can, gentle Strephon, once compare with thee. “Thy locks, that down in shining ringlets fall, “Thy form unequall'd, manly, graceful, tall; “Thy open countenance, and star-bright eye, “Thy health-flush'd cheek, where artless dimples lie; “Thy polish'd brow, unfurrow'd o'er with care, “Thy easy carriage, and engaging air; “The honey gliding music of thy tongue, “Beyond whate'er enamour'd shepherd sung; “Thy elegance of taste, and temper frank, “Conspire to set thee far above thy rank! “These render thee the Country's darling boast, “Of all thy fellow-swains distinguish'd most! “But O!—what shall a bashful maiden say? “These charms have stole Ethlinda's heart away! “Howe'er in numbers she affects to mix, “On thee alone her thoughts with rapture fix! “A thousand quaint remarks, and sighs apart, “Fraught with the unknown wishes of her heart; “A thousand looks, that mean expressive more “Than words can tell, though ransack'd o'er and o'er; “A thousand artless smiles, if Strephon by, “A thousand side long glances of the eye; “A thousand tender proofs, did she disguise, “Against her would in bold conviction rise.” “But such from noblest friendships oft are shown, “Which blushing Modesty herself may own. “Such too to Strephon's candid view they seem'd, “And shall not obvious Merit be esteem'd? “Is it forbid in females to admire? “Can Custom's laws such deference require? “Must maids to some excess be ever prone, “Pliant as wax, or harder than the stone? “Scorch'd by the flame that Love within excites, “Or cold as Winter-snows on Lapland heights? “Is there no happy medium to prefer, “Nor in the one extreme nor other err? “Ye Formalists! ye stiff censorious race! “With air demure, and grave disciplin'd face! “Say, where the bounds by Reason fix'd begin, “Which virgin Modesty must keep within: “How far say, and no farther, must the tide, “Without control, of female fancy glide, “Nor to o'erflow its banks, nor yet forsake, “As either might our int'rests leave at stake? “How Judgment may the helm, with prudent fear, “Far from the shallow, and the eddy steer; “That no rough blast, with unsuspected shock, “May dash us shipwreck'd on Misfortune's rock, “But down the current Hope may gently sail, “Wafted by ev'ry mild and pleasant gale. “Why have we faculties which angels share, “And fix'd on objects not beneath their care; “Why Fancy, which some bold flights still employ, “But the wide range of Nature to enjoy? “Why Memory, but, each excursion o'er, “To lay all her researches up in store? “Why have we passions of so fine a turn, “With Love to languish, or with Friendship burn; “Why those affections of a gentler kind, “To all the social feelings still inclin'd; “Why hearts of such refin'd materials fram'd, “To relish pleasures language never nam'd; “But to dilate, at the fond tender hour, “And feel the warmth of sentimental pow'r? “Why have we senses, of so keen an edge, “Of Nature's kind regard the living pledge, “None of her gifts so bountiful as they, “But pleasure through soft inlets to convey? “Why have we organs exquisite for sound, “But to be charm'd by Nature vocal round? “For vision, but to view, all sweet surprise, “Beauty, with soften'd look, and melting eyes? “For speech, but to express these chaste desires, “With which Love Innocence herself inspires? “Why fram'd thus mid Creation are we plac'd, “But what attracts of fair and good to taste? “Why thus endu'd? but virtue-caution'd when, “And where, to be as happy as we can? “Ah! self-deluder! arts like these must fail “O'er Nature's standard maxims to prevail. “Such arts may on thyself impose, but know, “Poor love-sick maid, such arts no farther go. “Echo, reposing in her rocky cell, “Till Love the tender tale essay'd to tell, “And conscious zephyrs, round thee wont to play, “Would all thy fair appearances betray; “Thy specious pleas, and inferences bold, “In their own vain fallacious light unfold. “Oft too, ere wearied with her silent walk, “Where deep'ning shadows seem'd around to stalk, “Cynthia, between the op'nings of the shade, “Beheld unseen the melancholy maid. “Nor she alone, unconscious to the eye, “But all her bright companions of the sky. “Oft as she wander'd, at the murky hour, “To some lone alley, or espalier-bow'r, “When all but Love, by wakeful cares opprest, “Retir'd to taste the sweets of downy rest; “Vesper shone witness of her flame avow'd, “If sobs and sighs are tender marks allow'd; “If looks, that seem in silence to complain, “If footsteps, that no certain course maintain, “If endless musings, with sad down-cast eyes, “To proofs of more than doubtful meaning rise.” She ceas'd—but little thought her Lover nigh, To hear, with broken voice and heaving sigh, The prompt confession from her bosom flow, With all the love-sad emphasis of wo. Strephon, who long stood like a statue fix'd, In ecstasy with speechless wonder mix'd, As these last words his ravish'd ear detain, No longer his impatience could restrain; But straightway steals, directed by the sound, Where haply the sweet mourner might be found. Nor wanders far—with rapture-quicken'd pace, He soon explores the oft-frequented place. Where, in a state of terrour and surprise, That wildly flash'd alternate from her eyes, With countenance deep-ruffled o'er with care, He found his sweetly-agitated fair. Oft she essay'd the forward youth to fly, As oft her feet their timely aid deny. Resentment seem'd to chide her strange delay, But something gently whisper'd her to stay. She judg'd him rude, but in a mild degree, Prudence condemn'd, but Candour set him free. Divided passions in her bosom rose, Love govern'd these, but female spirit those. But how unequal is the contest found, When Pride and Love contend to keep the ground? This always conquers, though against our will, That, in the issue, proves the vanquish'd still. A sudden glow, that made her charm the more, Her cheek in deep suffusion colour'd o'er. Unusual heavings in her bosom told, Her heart how caught, and his approach how bold. A soft confusion all her air betray'd, And mix'd emotions seize the silent maid. While Strephon too was in proportion aw'd, His looks would censure what his thoughts applaud. But why those tumults? that disorder'd look? Respect, with love, ne'er Strephon's breast forsook; His passion, still controll'd by too much sense, And much too delicate, to give offence. Thus, soon his aspect and address allay'd The various doubts of the half-angry maid. He spoke—but only, as her fears he saw, To make a gen'rous offer to withdraw. “O Pardon,” he in gentle accents cries, “Love too officious gave thee this surprise. “Pardon a faithful swain, who only proves “A bold intruder thus, because he—loves. “A frown that beauteous brow but to invade, “To him, Noon's brightest sun-beam would o'ershade; “Would to his wishes death at once impart, “And like a dagger pierce him to the heart. “If but his presence hurts my lovely maid, “She need but word her will to be obey'd. “Obey'd, in all that exile can imply, “From her, from love, and happiness to fly. “Say, charmer! shall I quit this sweet recess, “Sacred to friendship, nor to Strephon less? “Shall I my fortune all at once resign, “And, for thy ease and comfort, forfeit mine? “But can, to render life scarce worth a care, “Thy ease and pleasure be to him despair? “To his hard fate may Strephon then retire, “In secret pine, yet cease not to admire.” He stopt; and seem'd to think she whisper'd—no, Although her answer meant to bid him go; Yet, had she disallow'd his longer stay, She hop'd to find her Lover disobey. Thus pleas'd alike, alike to please inclin'd, Their equal wishes one acceptance find, While both, each selfish mean disguise above, Vow mutual constancy, and mutual love It will here be obvious, though shepherd, flock, &amp;c. are introduced, as giving a romantic air to the description, that, in the foregoing love-scenes, the writer never intended to preserve the simplicity of the pastoral character. This will apologize for Ethlinda being so great a reasoner in love.. Thus would the Muse, amid the din of arms Tumultuous, and the trumpet's loud alarms Written in the year 1761.; While War malignant rages unconfin'd, And purple Slaughter thins the human kind; The softer scenes of Peace attempt to paint, Beauteous her landscapes, though her colours faint. Faint, gentle Thomson! when to thine compar'd, With whom her skill kind Nature fondly shar'd, While ev'ry Season ran its full career, To draw a finish'd portrait of the Year! Nor is her subject of ignoble fame, Though less of sounding grandeur in its name. Peace shall exult supreme from shore to shore, When War's loud clangours kindle strife no more; Kings see themselves, who now like gods behave, Sunk to the level of their meanest slave. But to sylvestran scenes, where Fancy strays, Fountains and groves, confin'd her humble lays, While only zephyrs whisper in her song, Birds simply warble, murmurs glide along; Will no heroic bard, by glory fir'd, By victory and martial deeds inspir'd, Britannia sing, victorious o'er her foes, Whose smiles to peace a willing world compose? Sing Liberty, with civet wreaths adorn'd, Without whom, crowns shine only to be scorn'd? Who rouses not at Freedom's glorious name? Mounts up to transport, kindles into flame? Dilates in the big swell of conscious pride? And looks, and speaks, as if to thrones allied? Freedom, whose int'rests with Religion's mix, Howe'er vain schoolmen names distinct affix, As fibres of the heart together twine, Or glass-transmitted rays concenter'd shine; On one same gracious sacred errand sent, Alike in nature, motive, and extent! A separation is the death of each, Whate'er kings boast, or bold fanatics teach! Where-e'er Britannia's royal banners fly, Whether in nearer, or remoter sky, Conquest attends, shapes her resistless way, And quick decides the fortune of the day. What well concerted plans! what great designs! Where patriotic wisdom glorious shines! What orders with alacrity perform'd! Cities subdu'd, and mighty bulwarks storm'd! What acquisitions! what renew'd success! Our fortune great, nor yet our conduct less! How will these animate the future page, The splendid boast of each succeeding age! How all alive will Fancy's colouring glow! With what proud majesty the numbers flow! While some rapt Bard, whom Homer's genius warms, Sublimely sings, inspir'd, of men and arms, Makes British heroes rival those of Greece, The long-fam'd Iliad less a matchless piece! From Virgil's brow unties the age twin'd bays, To flourish on his own with tenfold praise! But shall such noble themes pass now unsung, Untun'd the lyre, mute the harmonious tongue? Shall Britain wide diffuse her warlike name, The earth not more unbounded than her fame, Nor yet a Bard, on whom the Muses smile, Be found through all her sea-encircled isle? Shall Albion's sons, renown'd for conquest long, In ev'ry place be heroes but in song? In ev'ry place, save in the tuneful page, Her trophies claim the wonder of the age! Next Him, in whom a nation can confide, The mighty helm of Government to guide; Calm, wise, discerning, steady, fix'd, as fate, To manage all the grand concerns of state; Next to the gallant Hero great in arms, Whose bosom more than Roman virtue warms, Whose valour, which to glory still inclines, Prompt executes the Statesman's bold designs; The Bard accomplish'd should be understood, As those of ancient fame, a public good. In ev'ry age depends upon his pen The gift of Immortality to men, Which great achievements not alone can give; Thus godlike names of old recorded live, The finest scenes of conduct and address, Applause that merit, or ensure success; The noblest efforts of heroic might, Exerted in the tumult of the fight, While rival kings in glorious strife contend, And crowns imperial on each stroke depend; If some illustrious Verse recite them not, Die of themselves, neglected and forgot ? Sed omnes illacrymabiles Urgentur, ignotique longa Nocte, carent quia vate sacro. Hor. Scindentur vestes, gemmæ frangentur et aurum; Carmina quam tribuent fama perennis erit. Ovid.. The mist of ages, gather'd by degrees, Where Study objects through false mediums sees, Spreads o'er Fame's fair horizon, and displays One gloomy, vast, inexplicable, maze; Still, in those native regions of romance, The more obscure, the further we advance, If Poetry, as day-break on the night, Shines not abroad to call from darkness light. But whether has the Muse digressive stray'd, Forsook the peaceful covert of the shade, To rush amid the noisy files of war, Led by the light of the Mœonian star? Tumult and death, while mighty kings dispute, Ill, beauteous Spring, thy gentle temper suit. The purple dye, on plains embattled seen, Forms a sad contrast with thy softer green. Thy love-tun'd voice, that sighs among the trees, With the loud roar of battle ill agrees. No more digressions shall the Muse prolong, But end with Thee as she began her song. Hark! in yon plantane-range, yon poplar-shade, Hard by the murmur of a lone cascade, Or where some antique pile, superbly high, Rears its enormous ruin to the sky; At Twilight's dusky hour, protracted long, The Nightingale plies her lugubrious song; Piteous, as if her gentle mate had died, Or tender young been ravish'd from her side. Warn'd by the dying cadence of her strain, Like her the screech-owl peeps out to complain. Complain of such as barb'rous would molest Her peaceful haunts, her ivy-circled nest. On yonder wall in solemn state she sits, While round and round the bat incessant flits, Yon time-rent wall, with moss-tufts overgrown, And utters forth her melancholy moan. Silence and mute Attention, guards serene, Meet to preserve the stillness of the scene. The pool in gentle undulations shook By the swift lapse of some near-falling brook; The milk-maid, as she bears her fragrant load, Singing aloud to cheer the dreary road; The beatle's drony pinions, slowly stirr'd, The frequent hoots of Night's ill-omen'd bird; The heifer lowing from adjacent hill, The mastiff barking from a distant vill; The shepherd's horn with lusty cheek full-blown, The gently-finger'd hautboy's milder tone; The momentary rustling of the breeze, Sighing in scarce-heard whispers through the trees; The break successive, and deep hollow roar, Of billows lashing some contiguous shore; The ceaseless hum of insects, hov'ring round, And flocks penn'd up with sleepy tinkling sound; The blackbird's clamours, lonely as she hops, Her infant brood, ah! ravish'd from the copse; The partridge shrill, in some adjoining park, Seeking her mate scarce obvious in the dark; The swallow, twitt'ring from her mud-built nest, As if to soothe her callow young to rest; Or noisy martlets, in phantastic play, And keen pursuit, winging their airy way; While each by intervals the ear detains, Sets off the nightingale's mellifluous strains; With endless contrasts varies ev'ry note, And gives peculiar softness to her throat. While, in one universal chaunt of praise, The common herd of warblers join'd their lays, Greatly as if superiour to the rest, In scornful silence she her voice supprest. But now, the wonder-list'ning world her own, When she can charm the pensive ear alone, In full impassion'd melody of wo, Through the dun shade her mournful numbers flow. Night, lurking in the distant vap'ry sky, Or hov'ring in her ebon chariot nigh, Transported, seems her visit to delay, Loath to obscure the faint remains of day. Echo too, fond no tender accent should The delicacy of her ear elude; From some lone grot, or antiquated tow'r, Exhausts her finest arts of mimic pow'r. Say, Music! by what fascinating art, Dost thou hold sov'reign empire o'er the heart? Say, whence thy pow'rs mysterious can arise, Sure some ecstatic impulse from the skies, By ev'ry nerve that vibrates to the brain, The soft ascendant o'er the soul to gain? Rapid and sudden, like ethereal fire, All the whole man resistless to inspire? Hail, potent lenitive! hail magic charm! The viper of his poison to disarm! The rabid tyger's deadly rage to stay, And soften lions rampant o'er their prey! Kindly to sweeten Fortune's bitter cup, And keep through life man's drooping spirits up! His journey o'er earth's rugged paths to smoothe, His toils to mitigate, his cares to soothe! To still the sigh that heaves the breast of wo, And dry those tears down sorrow's cheek that flow! But see! from yonder chambers of the sky, Sent by the sun his absence to supply, The full-orb'd moon, queen-regent of the night, In all the soft resplendency of light, With silent imperceptible advance, Slides up the clear cerulean's smooth expanse. Quick through the air the yellow radiance spreads, First faint reflected from the mountain-heads; Then, delicately checker'd, by degrees, It steals among the openings of the trees, Or on the river, mov'd in sprightly flow, Dances in mild vibrations to and fro; Anon immense, o'er all the landscape wide, Diffus'd in one uninterrupted tide. On as the meek-ey'd Empress glides serene, Stars, to augment the grandeur of the scene, Brightly arrang'd her sapphire path along, Or cluster'd round her car, in myriads throng. The solemn, glimm'ring, exquisite display Of beauties, Fancy ever would survey, Court the nocturnal Warbler to prolong, Nor court in vain, her finely-varied song. While Sleep prepares, with aspect still and calm, On human eyes to pour her opiate balm; The day-set task of busy Labour o'er, And care's incessant clamours heard no more; Retir'd the peasant to his straw-thatch'd cot, The noble, rich, and mighty, envied not; Content with what the beauteous Seasons bring, The wealth of Autumn, promis'd by the Spring. Spring! softest period of the circling Year! When all things in the bloom of youth appear; When Nature's hoary age seems quite renew'd, In Winter's arms late spent and wrinkled view'd; To which, while all the brighten'd landscape glows, Summer her radiant flush of beauty owes: To whose bland influence, and enliv'ning smile, If aught, in fancy, sentiment, or style, The Muse can boast of beautiful, is due The inspiration, and the tribute too. Ye kindred souls, whose taste is form'd sublime On Nature's faultless standard, friends of rhyme, Whose feeling hearts Spring's charms by instinct move, Cherish her labours, and the verse approve! But when, at shut of eve, all home repair, The soft delights of virtuous rest to share, Sweeter than that, on silken couch of down, Partakes the monarch burden'd with a crown; And leave the Solitude, more awful grown, To Philomela and the Muse alone; The Muse too must the scene sequester'd quit, To let unrival'd the proud Songstress fit. Unrival'd, save by Him, whose tuneful tongue Of life and death in lofty numbers sung; Who of those idols all so fond pursue, Riches and Fame, a faithful portrait drew; To man immortal set his matchless strings, Himself immortal render'd while he sings! The dark-brow'd Night, through her opaque domain, The Moon, with all the planetary train, Listen'd with silent wonder to his lay, Pleas'd thus preferr'd their empire to the day. He heard the latest quiver of her throat, Though echoes lengthen'd out each parting note. Who else, sweet Nightingale! could sing so well? Who else the twilight-harmonist excell? He saw the lark on early pinion rise, Saluting with her matin song the skies; The silver Majesty of night withdrew, And stars alternate vanish'd from the view; To other worlds, far as their beams can pierce, The Bard's nocturnal labours to rehearse! But simpler scenes the rural Muse delight, Her wing a stranger to so bold a flight; Far other themes attune the sylvan lyre, Far other strains Spring's modest charms inspire. The End of the Sixth and last Book. ODE ON SPRING. Addressed to Miss ? Now Spring, of seasons gentle queen, In flow'ry mantle rob'd of green; Her locks in beauteous ringlets spread, And rainbows circling round her head; From southern climes, which shar'd erewhile The vital sunshine of her smile; Upon a sun-beam gilded cloud, While grateful Nature shouts aloud, Approaches; led by jocund Mirth, To give ten thousand objects birth; Sparkling her eye, her aspect sweet, All azure pure beneath her feet. Approaches, to alight anon, Winter with all his tempests gone; To bid the month-divided year Begin its downy wing'd career; Awake the reed, the dance awake, And call creation to partake, While varions tasks and scenes employ, Of universal wealth and joy. The virgin choir of Graces bland, Each with a rose-bud in her hand, With dimpled cheeks in vermile dy'd, Attend their queen on either side. Around her sportive Cupids dance, Bending their bows with wanton glance; With various signs and various arts, Soon to surprise a thousand hearts. Plump buxom Plenty, pleas'd Content, And Peace, on gentlest errand sent; Gay social Ease, and Friendship kind, Make up her smiling train behind: While Music with her warbling lute, All in attentive silence mute, Through air in undulations toss'd, With gradual cadence gently lost, Swells the impassion'd note before, Sweetly repeated o'er and o'er. Hov'ring aloft in liquid sky, She views the earth with anxious eye, To see through all its wide extent, What change each place has underwent; Where Winter's triumphs most appear, To blast the sun-abandon'd year, (Rude tyrant thron'd on hills of snow), There most her favours to bestow. She views, and through the blue expanse Bids the bright Lord of day advance; Bids Winter's gloom, the sky that shrouds, Quick vanish into fleecy clouds; Commands the snows to fall no more, And colds to give their freezings o'er; Restrains the torrents of the sky, Soft dews their fury to supply; Forbids the angry storm to rage, While lawless elements engage, But, hush'd to silence by degrees, To imitate the fanning breeze. Thus all her mild commands express'd, To her arrival left the rest; Straight from a lucid cloud that bends, She with her jovial court descends; While Zephyr breathes around, and flings Ambrosial odours from her wings. Some of her light ethereal train Frequent the lily-broider'd plain. Pleas'd to survey on ev'ry side The variegated prospect wide. Some to the hill's aëreal height To bend their upward steps delight, And there, no vapours foul to wreathe, In elemental pureness breathe. Some to the river's shady banks, Where wild-goats wanton o'er their pranks, When noon-tide heats infest the air, With fond alacrity repair. Others, amid the grove's lone walk, With fancied forms affect to talk; Echoes, that deep in caves reside, And Zephyrs that in whispers glide: While numbers in the osier shade, For tender scenes of rapture made, Attune to love the sylvan reed, And chide each moment's forward speed. Where-e'er the blushing Goddess moves, Her smile, her touch, creative proves. Beneath the splendour of her eyes New infant-forms of beauty rise. Nature all life and transport seems, And earth with births impatient teems. The woods in waving foliage clad, The fields with checker'd carpets spread; The brook, late swell'd from melting hills, Gliding along in silver rills; The meadows stock'd with flocks and herds, The copses throng'd with warbling birds: Shepherds and nymphs, in parties met, With rosy cheeks and eyes of jet; In social strains prepar'd to sing The charms of Nature and of Spring, With hearts elate and looks serene, Beyond what raptur'd poets feign. Now from the city's noisy streets, Where Care with Grandeur ever meets, The winter-prison'd croud repair, With Spring soft rural scenes to share; Amply to gain in rosy health, What they had forfeited for wealth. Such hapless man's peculiar fate, Nor rich alike in all, nor great! If in one article he thrives, And one alone, howe'er he strives, In others, so high Heav'n decrees, His sudden ill-success he sees! Nor blame the justice of the skies; One falls, and hence a thousand rise. Nought but the partial love of gain Could them in noise and smoke detain; Save Spring's glad call no fond pretence Could court their loit'ring footsteps hence. But, more supremely charm'd than those, Julia the fair enamour'd goes The ever-lovely Dame to meet, With brow as mild and aspect sweet; Breath that partakes of her perfume, And cheek that emulates her bloom; By the green margin of a stream, That sparkles to the pointed beam; Beneath some ag'd romantic oak, Where thoughtful bards the Muse invoke; Up some fair eminence, from whence The landscape is survey'd immense; In some close copse, or woodbine shade, Or o'er some lawn, or upland glade; Some level vista's measur'd walk, Or deep recess where echoes talk; Where wakeful Philomel complains, And linnets warble forth their strains; Where airy Fancy strays alone In calm retirements of her own, And, though apart from human kind, Can company and converse find. Nor she alone charm'd with the year, It too with her would pleas'd appear. Her presence adds a grace to Spring, While softer all her warblers sing; Each object, in advance she meets, Exhibits all its choicest sweets; Beauty her fairest form assumes, More gaily smiles, or deeper blooms. She goes! but not to entertain The recollection light or vain, Or, by Spring's native charms uncaught, Idly to roam for want of thought. Far other laurels she demands From Virtue's consecrated hands; Far other suffrages of praise, Than Vice bestows, or Folly pays. Her mute companions most admir'd, By life's disgusting sameness tir'd, Are, Innocence in vestment white, And Fancy borne on pinion light; Content, still forward to rejoice, And Music with her love-tun'd voice; Peace, with pleas'd brow and aspect calm, And Health with breath of fragrant balm; Philanthropy, of boundless view, And Charity as boundless too; Friendship, that scorns each false disguise, And Pity, with tear-trickling eyes; Taste, of quick sense and feeling just, And Love, that knows no mean disgust; Meekness, of feature mildly sweet, Fond with Humility to meet; Gay Hope, whose looks a transport wear, And Silence with attentive ear; Fair Modesty, that loves to walk, No eye to see, no tongue to talk; Candour, the rough-told tale that smooths, And Sympathy, that kindly soothes; Lone Contemplation tardy-pac'd, And Solitude, in glooms solac'd; Wisdom, that draws the veil from Folly, And with the Muse sweet Melancholy. With such associates she retires, Traces their steps, their haunts admires; With them her pensive hours employs, And though alone, the world enjoys. Oh! when her wonted roams she takes, While ev'ry sense to joy awakes; Whether to yonder green alcove, Yon belvedere, or spacious grove; Or fine slop'd hill, that overlooks Flocks, shepherds, villas, woods, and brooks; Or shadowy vale, or sunny glade, Or lime-tree row's imbow'ring shade; Or gay parterre, or terrace-walk, Grac'd with each flow'r of courtly stalk; Or grotto cool, or arcade green, Or wilderness, with seats between: Propitious may the sylvan Muse, In her own lov'd retreats she wooes, While fields their richest tints assume, And op'ning rose-buds round her bloom, Her gentlest votary inspire, And warm her with celestial fire! May ev'ry rural scene she views, With Wisdom lone retir'd to muse; Whether the azure-mantled sky, The wood, or brook that murmurs by; The rising hill, or meadow green, Where shepherds with with their flocks convene; The colonnade, or tow'r-grac'd wall, The temple, or steep water-fall; The orchard, in full glory blown, Or parks, with bladed wealth o'ergrown; Or flow'r-plot, where carnations bloom, And gales their balmy wings perfume: May all, with inspiration stor'd, Some sentimental joy afford! Some hint, by study vainly sought, Some happy flight, some pleasing thought! An HYMN TO THE DEITY. In imitation of the CIVth Psalm The 104th Psalm is, perhaps, one of the finest compositions of antiquity, and only wants the appendage of some celebrated Heathen's name to be universally admired. It has undergone a variety of versions by some of the most distinguished wits, no less than twelve to the writer's own knowledge; all of them inspired with a laudable emulation to imitate or preserve the beauty of the sublime original. Of these, ten are in a learned language. No wonder therefore, if little new or striking should occur in the present attempt to illustrate this Divine Ode.. Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum. Hor. Ascend, my Muse, inferiour scenes give o'er, On wing of fire celestial heights to soar. No common subject now demands thy lays, Nothing below the great Creator's praise; Who systems calls to being when he wills, Whose presence Nature's wide expansion fills, But which, though not immensity confines, In empyrean worlds transcendent shines. Honour, his by prerogative alone, Is ever the attendant on his throne; While Majesty, approach'd with awe profound, Encircles him ineffable around. He clothes himself, unsufferably bright, In all the pomp of uncreated light; Though to frail mortals, but with breath inspir'd, Darkness is his pavilion dread retir'd; While seraphs, swelling the immortal strings, Veil their astonish'd faces with their wings. He spreads the spacious skies beneath his feet, Like a vast curtain, or expansive sheet; While æther swells transparently around, Pure elemental fluid without bound. On the broad deep the sapphire columns rise, That bear up the huge circle of the skies; Yon superb arch, where in full glory shine Proofs of superiour wisdom and design. Above, rais'd glorious by paternal hands, The mighty palace of Jehovah stands. Amazing height, and depth, and breadth, and length! Surpassing splendour, grandeur, beauty, strength! Eternity its basis! substance light! Attendants angels! area infinite! On ev'ry cloud a vehicle he finds, And walks upon the pinions of the winds. Through the vast stretch of infinite expanse, Suns darken'd in their orbits at his glance, Abroad he moves, omnipotently great, In all the glorious majesty of state. His angels round, that bend the duteous knee, Are spirits of pre-eminent degree; In whom glows out their Maker's image bright, Efflux of breath divine, first-born of light. His ministers bright rang'd before him stand, To watch each signal of supreme command; Active, as glances of ethereal fire, To execute what his behests require; Behests of mercy to his worlds around, Dispers'd through all the depths of space profound. Tempests themselves, impetuous as they blow, Strongly convulsing Nature's frame below; And lightnings, roll'd in vivid sheets around, His dreadful ministers of wrath are found. The mighty pillars of the Earth he laid, And her foundations everlasting made. In vain loud thunders break, and tempests rage, She stands unmov'd though elements engage. The swelling waters o'er the mountains rise, The great Abyss heaves boundless to the skies; At his rebuke the billows swoln subside, Restrain their fury, and contract their tide; With hasty tumult, and deep-felt uproar, Down through the valleys seek their destin'd shore; Where, circumscrib'd, immense barriers withstand Their hostile inundations on the land; While in his dwelling man secure resides, Hears Ocean roar, nor dreads his angry tides. He bids the springs gush forth among the hills, To wander through the vales in silver rills; Where, with his flock, the shepherd speeds his way, And asses wild their ardent thirst allay; Adown whose sides, wood-grown and vocal too, The feather'd tribe their tuneful tasks renew; His praise divine in choral numbers sing, Oft as his smile turns Winter into Spring; While echoes, up-rous'd by the general song, Catch ev'ry measure, and each note prolong. From his fraught clouds descend the timely rains, To fatten and refresh the thirsty plains. Æthereal fluid, of prolific pow'r, To give the vernal and autumnal hour: While all mankind their grateful joy declare, Bless'd with each mark of kind indulgent care; Content with what his various works produce, Charm'd with their beauty, harmony, and use. With flow'ry herbage he o'erspreads the field, A rich repast the milky kind to yield, In lusty droves that low from ev'ry hill, While flocks beneath the bleating meadows fill. And see the village-nymph, high-flush'd with health, Exhaust each udder of its balmy wealth; And homeward, guided by the twilight beam, In frothing goblets bear the luscious stream. Here, of fine movements, and majestic size, With deep-arch'd neck, and lightning-kindled eyes; Ears exquisitely-fashion'd, nostrils wide, And mane that flutters in dishevell'd pride; The sprightly horse, of more than vulgar breed, Delights through Nature's green retreats to feed; Or plunges, heated by the noon-tide beam, Amid the gelid river's closing stream; To cool the glow which through his vitals reigns, And check the tide that shoots along his veins. For Man he bids the juicy herb arise, That Plenty still may feast his ravish'd eyes; Bids various crops their turgid ears unfold, Each valley waving in autumnal gold; Bids the flush'd vine her purple clusters fill, And balm from ev'ry unctuous shrub distill: That wake to rapture man's expanded heart, And vigour to his well-brac'd limbs impart; To the soft cheek perpetual smiles bestow, And to each feature Health's fresh roseate glow. He calls the sap, detruded to the root, Among the boughs a living tide to shoot; And lo! a thousand forests stand display'd, In all the verdant majesty of shade; The hill-rais'd cedar, of superiour size, Mounts in adumbrant verdure to the skies; While zephyrs, thro' the full-spread solemn gloom, With aromatic scents their wings perfume. Hither the tuneful tenants of the air, As to a hospitable lodge, repair; Here, mutual pair'd, and by soft duties prest, With care parental build the downy nest; Here, on glad pinions waft the insect-food, To soothe with tender life their callow brood; Here, gently teach the infant-wing to rise, Anon to stretch unbounded through the skies: While in the bosom of a lofty fir The stork enjoys the mansion rais'd for her. On yonder tufted hill's romantic sides, Whose brow sublime oft the blue vapour hides, The wild-goats upward climb their dauntless way, Where Fancy's footsteps dread themselves to stray. Self-taught to climb, beneath no shepherd's charge, On Nature's hidden boon they feed at large; While in the rocks below, and shrubby dells, The nimble-footed cony silent dwells; At each return of eve, or dewy morn, Stol'n forth to nibble through the bladed corn. Kindled from the refulgence of his eye, The sun assum'd his station in the sky; Earth an unnumber'd progeny to give, And bid ten thousand forms of being live; Each season to enjoy its destin'd range, And day and night observe alternate change. In what bright beams of glory he ascends! How to his rise the gen'ral eye attends! How grand in Noon's refulgency of light! How soft his setting radiance on the sight! At his command the full-orb'd Moon arose. To mount her chariot at the twilight close; Relieve faint Nature from noon's sultry blaze, Amid the languish of her softer rays. Through vistas lone how mild her splendours gleam! How ocean swells beneath the placid beam! At her approach what crouds of twinkling stars Round Night's pale empress whirl their silver cars! Down the crystalline void, with graceful bend, He bids the rainbow's dewy prisms extend. From clime to clime the sign æthereal's seen, Radiant with orange, purple, and with green. Behind a broken watery cloud, the sun In one grand arch sees all his splendours run; To tell mankind no deluge shall o'erflow, As heretofore, the fated world below; But that bland moisture and refreshing show'rs, To give the earth new vegetative pow'rs, Soon as the fulgid wonder bends o'er all, Shall from the air-suspended conduits fall; To a light texture loose the kindly soil, And half anticipate the peasant's toil. Men view, with grateful hearts, and ravish'd eyes, The ample glory stretch'd across the skies; Meanly indulge alarming doubts no more, But prostrate kneel, sing praises, and adore. Darkness from Him its dreary being takes, When only Rapine, back'd by Murder, wakes; When, more than half-rejoic'd Creation gone To those chaste welcome slumbers toil brings on; Their aspects fierce the prowling race assume, Quit their dank caves, and stalk the rueful gloom. Rabid and gaunt, abruptly forth they pour, And add fresh horrours to the midnight hour; While but the moon, with pale reluctant ray, Shines conscious of their outrage on the prey. How swift their steps the trackless wilds explore! How loud the repercussions of their roar! How quake the world of animals around, Hid in their holes, or scamp'ring o'er the ground! The Lion, in majestic terrour proud, To awful silence hush'd the savage croud; Steps forth with slumber sullenly content, On slaughter and assault indignant bent. Enrag'd by want the shaggy monarch stands, And with redoubled roar his food demands; He rears his mane, discloses wide his jaw, And tears the prey beneath his ruthless paw. From the bright chambers of the East, at length, The sun arises, glorious in his strength; The sanguine tribe, each to his gloomy den, Retreat apace in gather'd troops from men. There, stretch'd behind huge carnage-clotted stones, Mid ghastly sculls, crush'd limbs, and fractur'd bones, Deep-gorg'd with blood, all-horridly they sleep, Or yawning grim, unceasing growlings keep. Eternal Sov'reign of the starry skies! Where-e'er we cast our wonder-gazing eyes, How admirable, how immense are found Thy works, through all creation's ample round! Of matchless skill what master touches shine! What signatures of workmanship divine? Till human thoughts, howe'er aloft they tow'r, Are lost in thy infinity of pow'r! O'er yonder wide cœrulean tracts on high, Thee in thy blaze of glory we descry; Thy Godhead's brightest characters survey, Nor need our Bible's mandate to obey: There, while suns unextinguishably burn, And planets on their golden axles turn; While comets take their grand æthereal range, And seasons in sublime progression change. But if the pinion aquiline descends, And to the Earth its downward flight extends; Earth we behold exhibit ev'ry hour, Like proofs of sapience, and creative pow'r; But chief of love paternal, that o'er all Thy other works for admiration call; Till with big transports each full heart runs o'er, And man's capacious wish can grasp no more! Here swells the ocean boundless to the view, Whose amber depths conceal thy wonders too. Here, wafted pathless through the booming tide, Beyond arrangement animals reside; Some of stupendous size, while gradual some, Smaller almost to infinite become. What eye not more than mortal can extend, Where these tumultuous worlds of water end? Whoe'er the gulf unfathomable plumb'd? Its islands number'd, or its treasures summ'd? Here, with broad sheets unloos'ned to the gale, Like flying castles, trade-built navies sail; Loaded with all the wealth of distant shores, What Luxury affects, or Want implores. Hence Nature's various products intermix'd, And bounds to home-bred prejudices fix'd; Hence elegance of manners takes its rise, And those fine arts affected by the wise; Hence ties commercial bind consenting states, While public faith secures, and justice rates; Hence friendly feelings wake the social heart, And int'rests join, whom mighty oceans part. Here huge Leviathans their dwellings keep, Monarchs enormous of the billowy deep; In awkward gambols, and unwieldy play, Like living mountains sweep their uncouth way; O'er the swoln surge in clumsy grandeur rise, And squirt the liquid columns to the skies. When the black tempest's midnight terrours form, And flame and thunders aggravate the storm; The cumbrous potent of the scaly throng Heaves unalarm'd his shapeless bulk along; Nature's dread aspect all sedate he braves, Amid the tumult of conflicting waves; Or sportive, while the elements engage, Deepens their horrours, and augments their rage. These all promiscuous, happy with their state, Daily on thee, Almighty Father, wait; Wait in observance of thy high command, To catch the prompt allowance from thy hand: It they receive, are satisfy'd, and own, With pleas'd content, to them thy bounty shown! To Earth aghast is turn'd thy wrathful look, The Earth is to her inmost basis shook; Sudden, at thy tremendous touch burst out In smoke the kindled mountains all about; Their loos'd foundations to the bottom rock, And nature to the centre feels the shock. Displeasure veils the smiles upon thy face, Dismay and anguish seize the human race; Thy finger interrupts their fleeting breath, They faint, they sink, o'erwhelm'd by instant death; Prostrate in ashes own thy vengeance just, Drop into nothing, and return to dust. From thy dread brow the cloud of anger falls, Thy voice with Mercy's tender accents calls; From depths of sorrow man erects his eye, To thee, great God, and thy relenting sky; Renew'd in beauty earth rejoicing stands, As first form'd perfect from thy plastic hands. So cloth'd in storms and vapours for a robe, Stretching his iron sceptre o'er the globe; When Winter steps abroad with sullen frown, From rocks abrupt his torrents tumbling down; The rural world, its vegetation gone, A wither'd form and aspect pale puts on; Gay beauty's soft diversities of hue Unfold no more, bedropt with pearly dew; Joyless the eye, round the wide landscape thrown, Sees one vast scene with wildness overgrown. But, when transported on a zephyr's wing, From heav'n alights the rosy-featur'd Spring; To Earth's cold centre, long unknown to day, Extends the Season's vivifying ray: Nature no more with mists invested glooms, But one unbounded jocund smile assumes; To vegetable life each object wakes, And Ruin her dread paths below forsakes. The glory of Jehovah shall endure, On rectitude his throne establish'd sure, Eternal, incommunicably bright, When yonder orbs are whelm'd in central night; When worlds in myriads through the mighty void, Have been in turns created and destroy'd. In his grand works, of each sublime degree, Shall his supreme complacence ever be. His works, each plann'd for some peculiar race, That croud the infinite profound of space! His works, to which compar'd, how strangely small The little extent of our atom ball! His works, howe'er unmeasurably great, That nothing seem, if by a God we rate! His works, which but himself can comprehend, The rap'trous song of angels without end! While salient life shoots through these conscious veins, And animation's latest spark remains; To thee, all-gracious Parent of the skies! My hymns on Faith's ecstatic wing shall rise. Thy orient sun shall hear my song renew'd, Ardent to his late parting blush pursu'd. Of thee, essential Excellence! of thee, Sweet shall each stated meditation be! Unutterably sweet, when pain, or grief Mocks the vain impotence of man's relief! In Thee, Supreme! alone will I rejoice, To Thee alone exalt my grateful voice. On Thee alone for support will I call, In Thee alone my wishes center all. Let those, ingrate, their own deluded foes, Who dare Jehovah's outstretch'd arm oppose, And at his dread perfections fearless scoff, Be, unlamented, from mankind cut off; Lest yet their guilt to bolder heights should rise, Astonish earth, and irritate the skies. But thou, my soul, thy nobler pow'rs exert, To act through life a less presumptuous part; To know thyself, that sum of wisdom when All other boasted knowledge dies with men. Still persevere in Virtue's sacred way, And all her laws with promptitude obey. Offer thy Maker still a holy flame, And bless for ever his transcendent name. THE THEORY OF TEARS. A FRAGMENT. Inscribed to Mrs Pleydell. Sunt lacrymæ rerum ? Vir. Tears, which the bar-rang'd oratours command, Are tears of pleasure for the fee in hand, The greater it the more abundant those, Rated by price, as wine by measure flows. But wines a due hilarity impart, Their tears add sadness to the client's heart. Grief, when sincere, by no vain proof appears, Too vast for the parade of formal tears. So, in the sky when deep-charg'd thunders brew, No clouds descend in rain, or melt in dew. On Tully's words when list'ning senates hung, Charm'd by the magic accents of his tongue, Few tears suffic'd; for tears then learn'd to flow Less at the call of Lucre than of Wo. Once from the offer'd hand your fee withdraw, That key which opes the cabinet of Law, Tears then no more shall their full sluices break, Nor eyes amid the dew of rhetoric—speak. The maxim then how much the truth beyond That hearts and eyes must ever correspond! Reverse the adage, and behold it true, If you mankind by no false optics view. The Doctor's tears, if doctors weep at all, That soon his patient will recover, fall. Each salient vein that vibrates towards health, Beats in repugnance to the pulse of wealth; Each sign that to an happy crisis tends, A tear resistless to its orbit sends. But here the pointed satire fain would stop, Joy too, like Sorrow, boasts her pearly drop. From fleecy clouds, on which the sun-beam plays, Oft falls the dew-show'r interspers'd with rays. Let Candour, then, who scorns the partial plan, Sometimes mistake the doctor for a man. “All hope is gone! behold! the doctor cries! “His tears speak out in silence from his eyes! “Good tender man!—but say, dear doctor, say, “Is it too certain what your looks betray? “Has Physic now no last resource to try? “And must the sweet, the lovely patient—die? “No, Heav'n be prais'd!” with fervour-lifted eyes, “My tears are tears of joy,” the doctor cries; “No more the fever's heats internal burn, “No more deliriums, big with fate, return; “Mix these few cordials, and your fears abate, “Our patient's in a convalescent state.” Short triumph! his lank purse so empty felt, Each eye would fain from other motives melt. Now certain hopes Health's kind prognostics give, So soon cur'd patients, how shall doctors live? Men must debauch, take fevers, faint, and rave, Few hopes attend them, and late periods save; Their fatal snares must wine and women spread, Or doctors go a-begging for their bread. Which is the worst alternative, let those That dictate from the casuist's chair disclose. Now to the pulpit turns the Muse's eye, There, haply, tears from proper fonts to spy; Doubtless, if such us any where o'ertake, Although with-held for Friendship's pressing sake, Though rarely found in rostrums, it must be Where God descends, and mortals bend the knee. Where all confess, a tale that still begins, How much Religion suffers by their sins, On whose sublime and venerable plan, We rise to angel, and renounce the man. But hold,—all honour to the sacred gown, Though less rever'd the gem-encircled crown. A scoff contemptuous here, were to decry Virtue herself, fair native of the sky. Were to defame the Volume of the skies, By God's own finger penn'd to make men wise. Degrade the gown, and ridicule the text, You must (dread thought!) dethrone Jehovah next. The person from the office we divide, To shun the stigma, or of guilt or pride; Pride, that betrays a littleness of mind, And guilt of a most disingenuous kind. Tears, gushing forth, the parson's sight bedim, His eyes, like stars in mists, uncertain swim; Nor wonder such his cautious lids beguile, For oh! the melting pathos of his style! Who can behold him, and refrain from tears? None, but the marble-hearted wretch who—hears. This vain parade of partial tears is shown, Because the preacher's to himself unknown. In big effusive consciousness they run, For what his pen, not wicked heart, has done. With contrite looks, and some few passing groans, His sins and errours multiplied, he owns; But let no censure from the critic fall, His pen omnipotent has cancell'd all. For acting ill, as few in both excel, Sure Heav'n will pardon him for—writing well. But this, not Nature's, but the preacher's law, No tears but sacerdotal e'er can draw; Hence, though the rapt self-conscious parson weeps, No social tear a well-bred cadence keeps; Or, if a courteous drop with his consents, The cheek alone, but not the soul, relents. Thus womens eyes abundant use to flow. If you the reason ask—they do not know. Few honest tears, like gentle Pleydell's, start, Conglob'd by Friendship, from the feeling heart. But shall rough Satire quite ingross the page, And through the numbers spend its Cynic rage? No; let some gentle subject close the song, To the soft passions softer strains belong. The muse increasing ardours too may feel, And kindle onward like a chariot-wheel; But not, as chariots raise the dust around, Truth to obscure, or reason to confound. Tears are the eye's pellucid dews, that fall At Pity's summons, or at Mercy's call; Though ruthless eyes oft-times affect them too, As stones themselves distill a breathing dew: As Spring's to earth, all-gently such impart A kindly genial softness to the heart. Tears, when the mind enjoys unruffled ease, For form-sake shed, or from desire to please, Seem like those rains, through sunshine oft sent down, From partial clouds, when Nature wears no frown. Tears are the special messengers, akin To oracles, on errands from within, To tell mankind, beyond conjectures vain, Those secrets Friendship only can explain; What active passions rise in tender strife, What soft affections touch the springs of life. Tears are the wordless language of the heart, That more, far more, than empty sounds impart; By which it loves, o'erburden'd, to complain, When speech would but offend, or prove in vain. Tears ease the soul in anguish and despair, And leave a sadly-pleasing languor there. Thus close-pent clouds dissolve in hasty show'rs, By which the thunder loses all its pow'rs; The sky, far as the spreading view unfolds, A temp'rature serene and soften'd holds. Tears are the gentle streams that off convey Those floods that would o'erwhelm us by delay; The heart's big swell, by hard misfortunes griev'd, That heaving soon would burst, not thus reliev'd. Tears are the tender proofs of love sincere, In silence shed, whence no reports take air; Shed, as the tribute of congenial minds, While each a more than vulgar transport finds: False eyes, indeed, may weep, if fame divulge, But true affection only can indulge. Tears are the debt, in pearly drops convey'd, But more than pearls in price, to merit paid; In which none act the base insolvent's part, But those whom Nature form'd without a heart. Tears wait on Vice, and oft on Virtue too, As winter-clouds dissolve in summer-dew. Tears, though the cheek a partial mark retain, Wash out, if shed aright, a fouler stain. Tears are the silent arguments to tell That man's immortal, though at first he fell. Immortal!—for he weeps for joy oft-times, Free from the sting of recollected crimes. And what can Nature's law thus counteract? What thus sensation's springs revers'd affect? O thought sublime! strong proofs inculcate hence, How much inferiour to the mind the sense, Dissolv'd in tears, that feebly it reflects Back to the soul what rapt'rous she expects; As Cynthia, though in full-orb'd glory bright, But faintly represents her parent light. Thus men infer, the soul superiour must Exist apart, when dust returns to dust. For, if the body impotent withstands Those transports she to infinite demands; Reason dare promise her desires immense, As Virtue's long-expected recompense, But when, or where, no mortal's taught to know, That full enjoyment sense can ne'er bestow, When matter lives in various forms no more, And all the farce of human life is o'er. THE PROGRESS OF EVENING; OR, THE POWER OF VIRTUE. Inscribed to Mrs Richmond Ingles. Jam Nox inducere terris Umbras, et cœlo diffundere signa parabat. Virtus ? Intaminatis fulget honoribus. Hor. The hurry of the busy world was o'er, And in the western ocean sunk the sun; Mild Eve, unlocking her ambrosial store, To throw thick shadows from the hills begun. A solemn stillness lull'd the silent world, The fleecy flocks within their folds retir'd; Save where the pebble-ruffled streamlet purl'd, Save where the grove with whisp'ring plaints inspir'd. Save where the thrush, perch'd on a thorny spray, Makes ev'ry echo vocal with his song, Join'd by the loud-pip'd blackbird's kindred lay, Down the dark lengthen'd vale protracted long. Save where the turtle, in soft cooing strains, While not a breath to interrupt him stirs, To his coy unrelenting mate complains, From the green bosom of encircling firs. Now, on the surface of the lucid stream, The youthful swains exert each active limb; Around in dewy light the waters gleam, Forming alternate circles as they swim. This charming exercise Health calls her own, Hence beauty, life, and pleasure be it nam'd, Fresh as Aurora on her eastern throne, Each gains the beach, in every nerve new-fram'd. Returning home, with triumph in his look, The Angler in his basket bears his spoils, The finny treasures of a neighb'ring brook, Or by his hook made captive, or his toils. On the green turf the village-rout advance, Maids of plump buxom form, and spruce-clad swains; Each mingles artless in the festive dance, Enliven'd by the fiddle's well-known strains. Each shepherd fronts the nymph he most admires, A glance declares what Colin's fears deny; Damon betrays his heart-consuming fires In the spontaneous language of a sigh. With native art, and well-affected scorn, Fain would each maid her ignorance pretend; But vainly would the east conceal the morn, When tipt with liquid gold the hills ascend. Now Contemplation mounts her eagle-wing, To take advantage of the special hour; Wonders, where-e'er she moves, before her spring, Court her attention, and exhaust each pow'r. Lost in a breathing wilderness of sweets, Through the wide garden's order'd walks she strays, Where Beauty with her sister Plenty meets, Reflecting each on each commutual praise. Yonder she stoops to view the lily clad In fair, unspotted mantle, white as milk; Narcissus here, with soft declining head, Dress'd in a figured robe of glossy silk. Let haughty monarchs, seated on a throne, Demand the homage of a thousand knees; Lo! Contemplation calls a world her own, All yonder sun in his proud circuit sees. In chariot, rapid as the whirlwind's speed, Astonish'd through Creation can she fly, Where systems in amazing change succeed, Nor stop to see an emperour pass by. No zephyr whispers through the sighing trees, No murmurs float down the pellucid rills; No forest-bloom invites the sipping bees, No lambkins bleat round from adjacent hills; No costly pearls lie scatter'd on the shore, No diamonds sparkle on their native rock; No metals glitter in their common ore, No coral blushes on its parent stock; No gaudy peacock spreads his rainbow plumes, A bright circumf'rence of resplendent hues; No bed of flowers the ambient air perfumes, No healing plant distills its balmy dews; No vernal songster tunes his tender lay, No foodful herb protrudes its infant stems; No insect flutters on the quiv'ring spray, No hawthorn twinkles, hung with pendent gems: Nature dispenses nought of fair, or sweet, Of useful, curious, delicate, or grand, But rises in luxuriance at her feet, But waits obsequious on her mild command. To Her, and gentle Eve, Silence, and Ease, Who would the bustle of a court prefer, At Virtue's cost where men are pleas'd, and please, Depart from Nature, and from Reason err? With them, as life advances in its round, Our knowledge and astonishment increase; Till, haply, with success our labours crown'd, Death shuts our eyes, and ends our days in peace. But now the wearied peasant's homeward gone, To taste the welcome sweets of healthful rest; Such rest as honest rural toil brings on, Not discompos'd by guilt, perplexing guest. Free from Ambition's wildly-fancied schemes Of boundless honours, riches, and renown; The fopling's raptures, and the miser's dreams, And endless terrours that beset a crown. Him at the door his smiling offspring meet, His wonted period they remember well; Lisping and prattling round in accents sweet, Each has its pretty artless tale to tell. See, how they strive to grasp his willing hand, Jump to his arms to share the offer'd kiss! Let kings with empty glory states command, Even kings might envy such a scene as this. With what the garden's wholesome beds afford, The simple pantry, or the milky churn, Within his consort spreads the humble board, Impatient for his welfare and return. Let not the homely peasant then repine, Though coarse his fare, and his attendants rude; Let princes boast their rarities and wine, His cooling esculents are better food. These give an active vigour to the nerve, And paint with roseate bloom the smiling face; From num'rous ills the hardy frame preserve, That torture and deform the human race: The whizling asthma, and consumption wan, The stone, the gout, the ague, and catarrh; Those foes conleagu'd implacable 'gainst man, That slaughter more than fall a prey to war. Summer for him matures her finest roots, Suckles each wholesome plant, and balmy herb; For him the orchard swells with choicest fruits, And ev'ry meadow wears a flowery garb. Excursive bees, for his luxurious use, With liquid sweets distend their waxen cells. For him rich crops Autumnal suns produce, While underneath his roof kind Plenty dwells. What would the man, from Virtue's paths astray, Whose thoughts perplex, whose passions domineer, Uncheck'd by sober Reason's friendly sway, Harass'd by conscience, and disturb'd with fear; What would he give one moment to enjoy The lowly ploughman's toil-inhanc'd repose, Sweet cordial slumbers never known to cloy, Which, big with boasts, proud Grandeur ne'er bestows? Did mankind know what palaces contain, What splendid mis'ry fills a coach and six; What Hydra mischiefs round encompass Gain, What poisons with Earth's choicest pleasures mix: Could we conceive but half the piercing smart That often lurks beneath a specious show; The keen remorse, the sorrow-bleeding heart, The sad reflection, and the poignant wo: Sure our ambition would no higher rise, No larger views our restless wishes swell, Than with the hind, now all his labour o'er, Beneath the cot's unenvied roof to dwell. Contented to partake the homely dish, The herb, the root, the brook that murmurs by, Viands, though not high-season'd to our wish, Which health, grey hairs, and strength of limb supply. Such topics croud upon the studious thought At the soft period of departed day; The soul seems now by intuition taught, And wak'd by magic the spontaneous lay. Quick as the eye, in many a vivid glance, Shoots o'er the landscape's variegated scene; Fancy sinks in enthusiastic trance, And pleasing rapture thrills along each vein. For what rapt muse, with philosophic eye, Half thy productions, Nature, can run o'er? Sooner arrang'd the stars of midnight sky, Or aggregated sands that form the shore. When Morn impearls the ground with shining gems, Beauty seems in her fairest form array'd; While gradual she expands the tender stems, Or sits with Meditation in the shade. But see mild Eve approach, by zephyrs fann'd, Breathing the garden's humid sweets around; Still softer beauties rise at her command, Flow'rs rob'd in fairer liv'ry strow the ground. Nor, on the scorching heats of noon intent, When Vegetation droop'd her sickly head, Are Recollection's thoughts now idly spent, To lessen ev'ry object round her spread. When Spring succeeds inclement Winter's reign, And turns his frown of horrour to a smile; What new-created charms bedeck the scene, Wrapt up in vapours, mists, and storms erewhile. But Summer comes, to rule the laughing year, Her cheek the glow of health, her breath perfume; Where e'er her flow'r-enamel'd steps appear, How rich the drap'ry! and how deep the bloom! Has Nature yet a larger fund in store? She has; see Autumn bending with his load Of yellow full-ear'd wealth, unknown before, On Industry's peculiar sons bestow'd. Thus fondly still the present we conclude, More lovely, more attractive than the past; Our wonder heightens with the object view'd, Their origin the same, the same their last. Such rich variety, such beauteous change, Revolving still, as months complete their signs, Where-e'er our fancy-guided footsteps range, But chiefly when Day's parting sun-beam shines. Aside when Nature lays her dazzling robes, And mantles her fair form in sober grey; When gentle Eve rounds the soft dew in globes, And scatters them translucent on each spray. Transported with the scene, the pensive Muse Strays onward by a stream's meand'ring flow; Where, in a length of avenue diffuse, Majestic elms their bending shade bestow. Hither with fond alacrity she moves, To woo fair Virtue in her native seats, For Virtue solitude and silence loves, And oft to them from drawing-rooms retreats. Hills, at some distance, with ambitious height, Ascending to the skies, confine the view, From which the sun, in scatter'd rays of light, Took, like departing friends, his late adieu. Here, in the centre of a shady bow'r, Rises a seat of turf, enamel'd o'er With a rich carpet of each fragrant flow'r, While branches arch'd an entrance form before. Ivy around with honey-suckle twines In wanton folds its fondly-clasping arms; While, as the twilight through each op'ning shines, The mantling gloom seems to display new charms. Sparkling with crystal rocks, and orient gems, There fretted grottoes boast each curious shell, Embellish'd by the coral's blushing stems, Where Art would Nature in address excel. In drousy tinklings, or in murmurs deep, Yonder a cascade swells upon the breeze, Abruptly falling down the rocky steep, Finely beheld through intermingling trees. Oft from the vulgar croud, the venal throng, Loathing Life's vain parade of forms and toys, Here Meditation steals, and brings along No languid relish for sequester'd joys. The World, compos'd of senseless mode and show, A dull impertinence of care and strife; At least one maxim teaches us to know, That to enjoy, is to retire from life. In such a peaceful consecrated shade, If, recollected in itself, the mind Mourns no gross errours, from Uprightness stray'd, Each his lost Paradise regain'd may find. For what was paradise? the sweet recess Of Innocence, unconscious of a blush; When no fell serpent taught men to transgress, No fruitage tempted with deceitful flush. If guilt embitters not the cup of life, If no distress broods o'er the troubled thought; If Passion kindles no intestine strife, In ev'ry grove an Eden may be sought. How sweet from tumult often to withdraw, From ostentation, noise, and bustling care, Where sordid Self reigns with despotic law, And here breathe copious draughts of healthful air. The sun, rejoicing in his mid-day bow'r, Has oft beheld me pensively reclin'd, And, ere dismiss'd the thoughtful musing pow'r, With welcome beam in distant climates shin'd. Then, all the air felt one continued glow, The panting swain, while strength and spirits fail, Suspends his toil, and where cool streamlets flow, Sits down with breast expanded to the gale. Smitten and vanquish'd with excessive heat, The herds stroll breathless to the gelid shade; Silent, the birds to deepest glooms retreat, The drooping rose's damask blushes fade. But now, refreshing genial coolness reigns, Fans in the breeze, or falls in dewy show'rs; Cattle in droves browse o'er the verdant plains, And deep vermilion paints the lifeless flow'rs. Thus Nature acts on wise prudential plan, (Her plan all should industriously pursue) How grateful such vicissitudes to man, Ensur'd his safety, and his pleasures too! Did constant heat or cold o'er-rule the year, Soon Vegetation would our Earth forsake; Did endless light prevail, or darkness drear, What could our listless lives more wretched make. But gracious Heav'n, still uniformly good, These wide extremes attempers still so well, That, if our weal or duty understood, To be dissatisfied, is to rebel. Thus, while around the alcove's freshness breathes, And nightingales protract their songs of wo; While the faint breeze sighs through the jes'mine wreathes, The Muse's numbers not unconscious flow, Each scene of mirth and gaiety's now fled, The nymphs and swains forsake the flow'ry lawn, All save the Muse, by vagrant fancy led, To their respective mansions are withdrawn. Martlets now quit their airy circling range, Decreasing still their clamours as they fly; The lone bat, flitting with incessant change, On leathern pinion wings the darksome sky. The wheeling hornet no one course confines, On heedless here, now there, dull drone, he holds; In lucid spangles, lo, the glow-worm shines, As o'er the blade he drags his spiral folds. Creation now seems mantled in a shade, But soon this momentary darkness ends; A promis'd visit yet remains unpaid, To welcome it the willing Muse ascends. The moon, pale empress of the midnight hour, Full orb'd, moves forward on her ebon wain; With unperceiv'd, but with resistless pow'r, To rule the ebbing and the flowing main. Hesper, warn'd by her quick approach, retires, And modestly withdraws his fainter light; First star that hangs, replete with twinkling fires, Its silver lamp in the blue vault of night. Peeping alternate through the twilight sky, A thousand little sparkling orbs advance, To pay their court, in radiance not to vie, And grace her path-way cross the arch'd expanse. The herb, the plant, the dew-bespangled flow'r, Drain'd of each breathing juice, each gelid sweet, While Day's bright lord o'er-rul'd the sultry hour, Her softer beams, her gentler presence greet. On yonder elm, in spreading foliage drest, The owl sits melancholy bird of wo; Enthusiastic rapture thrills the breast, While from her throat the uncouth numbers flow. The cavern'd rock returns her rueful moan, Sad through the trees the dreary accents glide; The tott'ring tow'r, with ivy overgrown, Oft as she told her piteous tale, replied. Silent, within the leafy copse inclos'd, Remote from harm, the warblers of the spring, Each in its little downy nest repos'd, Listen, and nearer press with cow'ring wing. Methinks, amid this solitary gloom, The soul would soar on eagle's wing sublime, As earth's whole stretch affords but scanty room, Beyond the utmost boundaries of time. Methinks she seems oppress'd beneath the weight Of her conceptions, up to transport wrought; Sinking with her own voluntary freight, And overwhelm'd in the profound of thought. At such a crisis, how the bosom glows, How the full heart swells with unknown desires, Virtue herself, or Richmond only knows, Whom gentlest feelings move, and taste inspires. Nature, profusely lavish of her charms, Ne'er form'd before a more alluring place; Never did trees extend their leafy arms, With more umbrageous friendship to embrace. Never did raptur'd music charm so well, While Philomela told her mournful tale; Never did odours of a sweeter smell, Freight, evanescent, the warm southern gale. Never did colours finer mix'd reside In fairer flow'rs to fix the ravish'd look; Never did murmurs more attractive glide In crystal globules down the gurgling brook. Ne'er did the moon, from her nocturnal steep, Shed milder influence on the lambent eye; Never did Silence softer vigils keep, Or wing'd Imagination soar so high. For Virtue now the Muse's fancy caught, And Contemplation's ev'ry pow'r ingross'd; Absorbing each less interesting thought, As Cynthia's beam in noon's effulgence lost. She gives a heighten'd verdure to the plain, And branching shade, new brightness to the sky; A softer cadence to the warbler's strain, Scarce, else, distinguish'd by the ear, or eye. Virtue! for whom the grand Creation rose, Emerging fair from chaos and from night; Though various jarring elements compose, Govern'd by wisdom, and upheld by might. For whom shone forth yon centre-station'd sun, The moon, and all the planetary train, Which still in stated equal circles run, Order of days and seasons to maintain. For whom Almighty Power will stretch its arm. To raze the column that sustains the world; While her bless'd sons survey, without alarm, Ten thousand globes prone into ruin hurl'd. Virtue! the theme that tunes the martyr's lyre, Oft as her smiling radiant form he eyes; Sets the angelic bosom all on fire, And brightens ev'n the mansions of the skies. Virtue! by whom inspir'd, great names of old Dar'd nobly to contemn the tyrant's frown; Sublimely firm, heroically bold, No parasites, no cringers to a crown, Though chain'd in dungeons, burning in the flames, Or nail'd fast to the ignominious tree; Yet torment the most hardy natures tames, And conquers, Virtue! ev'ry thing but—Thee. Virtue! ador'd and practis'd by the wife, The noble, gen'rous spirit, and the brave; Ambition's adequate, consistent prize, All our vast hopes affect, or wishes crave. Virtue! pure source of rapture, to supply Large draughts to chaste and elegant desire; Not transient, like the dews of evening-sky, Not flashy like yon shoot of meteor fire. Sweetly with whom retir'd, the hermit's cell, Howe'er fastidious Grandeur keeps aloof, Though herbs his meat, his drink the crystal well; Invites beyond the lordly festoon'd roof. But what mere mortal pencil can depaint That portrait angels call devoutly thine? The boldest strokes, the richest tints are faint, Alas! how infinitely languid mine! But O! forgive the well-intention'd lays, Nor, though the tribute's small, reject the will; Beyond the strains that only sound thy praise, The heart that loves thee is accepted still. From thy fair presence, struck with conscious awe, Cursing their abject littleness of form, Abandon'd Guilt's ignoble throng withdraw, As from bright Spring the wint'ry gloom and storm. Stung to the heart, there, Insolence and Pride, Sour Jealousy with agitated mien; Envy, and sister Obloquy squint-ey'd, Dark Discontent, and self-tormenting Spleen. Here, Avarice, his soul absorb'd in pelf, His Heav'n, his all, some scraps of gilded ore; Nought more contemn'd by wise men—save himself, Oppress'd with wealth, yet grasping after more. Deceit, Malevolence, and swoln Disdain, Hypocrisy, wrapt up in false disguise; Remorse, dire source of bosom-rending pain, Despair, with ghastly looks, and staring eyes. These hell-born monsters, this detested crew, Abash'd from thy vindictive throne retire; Unable to sustain thy piercing view, Or bear the frown of thy celestial ire. But gentle is thy train! surpassing fair! Sincerity, with open honest face; Meekness with downcast eye, and placid air, And Beauty full of dignity and grace. Sweet Modesty, dress'd in a robe more white Than snow new-dropt from Winter's fleecy store; And Charity, with exquisite delight, Still doing good, still wishing to do more. Bright Liberty, first blessing of the skies, Without which angels were far less than man; Friendship, with fervent heart, and eager eyes, Still acting on the candid gen'rous plan. Science, unlimited by time or place, Her compass ever pointing towards truth; Content, with smiles eternal on her face, And Health, to age itself ensuring youth. Peace, with the olive blooming in her hand, Around her all the splendid Arts arrang'd; Plenty, diffusing gladness through the land, From clime to clime her liberal gifts exchang'd. Illustrious Patriotism, nobly warm'd, And vehement, in Freedom's sacred cause; With seven-fold terrours resolutely arm'd, To save his country, and assert its laws. Valour, with shining folds of laurel wreath'd, Trophies of glory sculptur'd on his shield; Who ne'er beholds his dreadful dagger sheath'd, Against her foes when Virtue takes the field. Justice, still weighing with impartial scale, Mercy and Pity, gentle sisters twain, While Misery relates her melting tale, Still shedding tears, nor shedding them in vain. These are the Glories that surround thy throne, That Thee their parent, friend, and guardian call; The Graces that thy soft dominion own, Catch thy pleas'd glance, and wait upon thy smile. Though ridicul'd, or slighted, for thy sake, Who would not court thy favour and acclaim; Live in thy temple, of thy joys partake, Howe'er unknown to Fortune, or to Fame? O! make me sympathetic but with thee, Thy feelings conscious feel, thy knowledge know; Hear with thine ear, with thy own soft eye see, I ask no more, Heav'n can no more bestow! But now the chilly vapours of the night Fall thick and fast, loud from a village-spire, While death-like sleep seals up the human sight, With solemn toll the clock warns to retire. Rous'd by the sound, no more the copse confines, Homeward the Muse accelerates her way; While through the trees a yellow radiance shines, A faint resemblance of departed day. The active pulse of Nature beats no more, Care's breathless voice sunk to spontaneous rest; Save where the miser counts his rusted store, Yet Want, fell harpy, gnawing at his breast. Save where the house-dog, faithful to his trust, Keeps through the sullen gloom incessant watch; Or where the sons of gluttony and lust Prolong the noisy revel and debauch. But hold—be censure here discreetly hush, Virtue's chaste song let no suggestion taint; Prevent yon conscious moon's indignant blush, Nor interrupt Night's silence with complaint. RURAL SPORTS, Descriptive and Elegiac. In Three Parts. ? utile famæ, Vitæque et membris. Hor. PART I. ANGLING. Inscribed to James Hamilton, Esq; Unmann'd by sloth, and unrelax'd by ease, Without the rod, the basket, or the line, My friend, can Angling e'er pretend to please, Howe'er alert the Muse's faith, or thine? Oft has the monarch trout, by art betray'd, To your well-practis'd fly a victim rose; Come then, experienc'd, to the Muse's aid, And where the sport's aught injur'd, interpose. Now Winter, muffled in his russet cloak, The surly blasts attending in his train, Seiz'd his dominions, and his sceptre broke, With sullen frown forsakes the shiv'ring plain. Huge as the tyrant stalks, while, roaring loud, The tempest rous'd his gloomy rage betrays, Fair Spring, descending on a purple cloud, Her virgin presence in the east displays. Onward the goddess moves, with graceful tread, In flowing em'rald vesture loosely drest; A flowery garland circles round her head, And damask rose-buds blush upon her breast. Smiling, on hill and dale she looks around, On grove, and coppice, ravish'd of their charms; And verdant carpets clothe the naked ground, And trees extend the umbrage of their arms. The river, late swell'd with descending rain, With torrents tumbling down the mountain's sides; No more sweeps rapid o'er the delug'd plain, But in its native channel gently glides. Zephyrs with fragrance load their fanning wings, And breathe soft whispers thro' the conscious grove; With pipe attun'd the feather'd warbler sings, Hid in the foliage of a green alcove. In this gay season, when unnumber'd scenes. Of elegant amusement charm mankind, When past'ral life, and simple nature reigns, Chiefly admir'd the Angler's sport we find. His line to finish, twisted round and round, Quick to the wide inclosure he repairs, And from the courser, sweeping to the ground His tail luxuriant, pulls the chosen hairs. Next, to the wood he hies with urgent haste, And of firm ash shapes his elastic wand; Joint upon joint with just proportion plac'd, It bends, it tapers in his poising hand. To flutter unsuspected o'er the brook, Last he equips his artificial fly; Fictitious wings conceal the lurking hook, Delusive colours gleam upon the eye. Furnish'd, he trips, in light-spun frock attir'd, Along some level green, or shelving hill; Fancy, by quick enthusiasm fir'd, Anticipates the success of his skill. Arriv'd, his curious tackle he unties, With prompt address adjusting ev'ry part; While humid evening, and a shadowy skies, Invite the finest essays of his art. But first some precepts would the muse propose, Haply not foreign to the sportsman's care; Success in angling still depends on those, Which still the best instructed oft'nest share. Prefer the livid, short, distractile hook, The clear, round, shining, pliant hairs select; Each maculated tenant of the brook A failure here will readily detect. Cull, from the turtle's variegated wings, Where tints in rich variety prevail; Each warbler on the leafy spray that sings, The wild-duck's glossy neck, and peacock's tail; Provide the finest plumage each displays, And decorate in it your mimic fly; Consult Experience, follow what she says, But few mistakes escape her sapient eye. Form not its body of too large a size, Nor yet too small—the happy medium chuse; This oft eludes the trouts' exploring eyes, That with distrust and loathing they refuse. With just proportion shape each splendid wing, To spread and flutter on the dimpling pool; Still near to life your imitation bring, Its faultless and invariable rule. See yonder pensile birch, that gently nods Its leafy umbrage o'er the crystal stream; Mark well what insects croud its quiv'ring rods, What vivid hues on their spread pinions gleam. These ever vary with the circling sun, Each smiling month has its peculiar hue; This, when your pleasing office is begun, Keep ever as the pattern in your view. Nor let your hook, a fault which oft occurs, Be left expos'd to scare the timid game; Down, cotton, velvet, feathers, tissues, furs, Unite their aid the curious garb to frame. Florella thus, if she with fond success Would charm us, charm'd alas! with too much ease, Must study ev'ry elegance of dress, Each fav'rite mode, each ornament to please. Climates remote, to forward the design, Must at her toilet their joint tribute pay; See the phantastic airy charmer shine, Prompt to dissemble, gaudy to betray! But to attend the busy Angler, where He shifts progressive down the winding stream, Be now the object of the Muse's care, A not inglorious, though an humble theme. On a green bank he takes his watchful stand, Silence and Hope his mute companions twain; Then casts his arching line with practis'd hand, While no rude brambles it midway detain. Quick o'er the glassy brook's serene expanse, It playful glides, in many a pleasing frisk; In gazing crouds the cautious fish advance, Wary as yet the bold attempt to risk. Sportsman, despair not; ply your finest art, Shift circumspect, and humour as you move, Where bubbling rills in distinct channels part, Or pendent branch luxuriant waves above. Or, where translucent the wide pool receives The gurgling streamlet, by no stoppage held; Or, in alternate circles gently heaves Refluent, from the shrubb'd oozy bank impell'd. Beneath that pond'rous stone's projecting seat, Deep hid in mud, the parent trout resides; There, with a jerk, direct your pinion'd bait, Behold! he stirs, and near the surface glides. Skim light your fly against the silver tide, Or with the current let it move with ease; Leave no ingenious lesson unapply'd, Lose no position that will surest please. Impatience and confusion wisely shun, Coolly observant, and discreetly slow; Whate'er the office, or the task begun, Rashness is justly held their greatest foe. Reserve and coyness conquer'd by degrees, His spotted sides he ventures now to show, In wanton pranks:—O for a friendly breeze With gentle curl adown the stream to blow! Rustling the shrubs, reclin'd from side to side, It breathes, obsequious to his ardent wish; In liquid furrows lifts the yielding tide, Sad omen to the unsuspecting fish. Vainly intent far other prize to share, While a dusk cloud o'ershadows all the sky, Dauntless he leaps, lur'd by the specious snare, And desp'rate seizes the deceitful fly. Writhing he flounces, frantic with his pain, The feather'd hook deep-fix'd within his jaw; His speckled fellows he implores in vain, From his misfortune cautious they withdraw. He runs, he shoots, indignant, through the brook, And tugs the shifting line with ceaseless gill: Angler, attend; be wary with your hook, The present moment claims your nicest skill. Fain would he seek his old secure retreat, Beneath the tangles of an ancient tree, Where he was wont to shun the sultry heat, The monarch of the flood, from danger free. A thousand ways he pulls the bending rod, Struggling for freedom with incessant strife; Or, by a secret well-dissembled fraud, Floats down the stream, as if depriv'd of life. But lo! not long abandon'd to despair, Near and more near approaching to the side, Again he stretches out the lengthen'd hair, And furious lashes the unconscious tide. Now see him bounce aloft, now plunging sink, Vainly the barbed death to disengage; Quick let the Angler play him to the brink, In idle toil exhausted all his rage. On the green turf he throws his beauteous prize, Successive gasps dilate each crimson gill; He gazes on it with insatiate eyes, Nor fails to pass encomiums on his skill. One strong effort ends all its feeble strife, It rolls, it twists, it quivers with its tail; Then spends in fluid air its panting life, While oozing blood distains its polish'd mail. O could the Muse end here her sylvan strain, Nor wake to harsher notes the conscious reed! Must pleasure ever be allied to pain, As shadows from their substances ne'er freed! When bursting torrents from the skies descend, And swelling floods their feeble mounds o'erflow, That seem abroad vindictive to portend A second deluge on the world below; To yonder swain in lonely copse repair, (Can Censure here repress her wrathful tongue?) See him the hook of sharpest barb prepare, The living bag loose on his button hungs. From this a helpless innocent he draws, A reptile call'd, though heard not to complain, Design'd to feel, by Nature's sapient laws, The thrill of pleasure, and the smart of pain: It from the kind investing moss he hales, That moss its native cov'ring wont to grow, And on the hook with merc'less hand empales, Twisting convuls'd in agonizing wo. Deep in the flood he throws the mangled bait, A bold advent'rer from the finny throng, With fatal greed, devours the certain fate, Plunges, and heaves, and drags, and darts along. Blame not, ye youths, to rural sports inclin'd, The angry Muse, but as a friend severe. Pity's the noblest passion of the mind, A fiend an angel without pity were. Think, Angler, what excruciating smart The harmless victim, unappris'd, must feel, When, close adherent to its bleeding heart, Remorseless forth is torn the pointed steel. Leave death and carnage to the reeking knife That thins the fold, the meadow, and the stall; No creature idly ravish'd of its life, Alas! unable for relief to call. Nor let your circling nets, with hollow sweep, Exhaust the rivers of their speckled brood; Convey your engines to the billowy deep, Where squammy millions roam, a common good. And, haply, if an useless prize too young With feeble pull bends your reluctant rod, Back let the slender forward thing be flung, Toss not the infant on the mossy fod. With piteous eye his tender youth behold, Long should he yet in sportive freedom glide; Few dawning suns have ting'd the hills with gold, Since first his fins essay'd the silver tide. Ere two succeeding springs, with genial beam, In verdant foliage clothes the mantling grove, Grown to full size, the father of the stream, Agape for food, exulting will he rove. Then, to the spacious river's grassy banks, Humid with pearly drops of evening-dew, Lead him, indulging o'er his youthful pranks, The conquest justly is reserv'd for you. PART II. FOWLING. Inscribed to John Hamilton, Esq; Charm'd with the sprightly thunder of the gun, With well-bred pointer's nose sagacious charm'd; For moors and parks, will you o'er pages run, And spring the game by fire-side unarm'd? This will your powder frugally preserve, Haply to guard you from nocturnal foes; Thus will no aching joint, no twitching nerve With frequent starts disturb your night's repose. When Autumn's golden treasures are led home, To occupy the farmer's yards at large; When flocks and well-fed herds promiscuous roam, Free from the deep-sunk fence, and shepherd's charge; While Morn, immantled in her purple robe, Lights the transparent dew-drops on the green, Or Noon extends her empire o'er the globe; The sportive Fowler's music wakes around. The fatal tube, of temper'd metal wrought, Rests innocently glitt'ring on his arm; With leaden death and sleeping thunder fraught, Explosive soon to give the quick alarm. Around his waist, girt like a virgin zone, The bag-sustaining leathern belt is tied; With careless air, loose o'er his shoulders thrown, The powder-flask hangs dangling at his side. Beware, ye game, ye feather'd tribe, beware, Fly to the shade, nor trust the naked ground; Behold the eager youth his wiles prepare, And all your fond retreats explore around. Softly he steals across the stubble field, Nodding erewhile beneath luxuriant grain; His hands the pointed piece precautious wield, Oft cock'd, oft levell'd, but as yet in vain. The scouring pointer snuffs with subtile nose Each blast that stirs the air's elastic waves; Of ev'ry gale that sighs, or breath that blows, Sagaciously observant he behaves. Now, many a park his weary steps had rang'd, No ridge, no furrow his strict search eludes; Sometimes the champain for the copse is chang'd, To see what bush conceals the sportsman's goods. How on his organs reason seems to gleam, For scarce mere instinct could so oft succeed! Not idly, with the wind's deceptive stream, But full against it, he directs his speed. Now, fresher odours swell the loaded breeze, Certain assurance of the covey near; Close and more close approaching by degrees, The wary tread declares his prudent fear. Straitway, flat-cow'ring on the ground, he sets The nut-brown partridge, long time vainly spar'd; The Fowler quick unfurls his swelling nets, A waving prison ah! for her prepar'd. Alarm'd and trembling, from the earth she springs, But strives in vain to gain her native skies; Vainly she flaps and flutters with her wings, Breathless and spent, inclos'd by snares she lies. Ah! what avails it, when the rising sun Illum'd the east, (of freedom now bereft) She saw delighted her fond younglings run To feed on scatter'd ears by peasant left! Ah! what avails the covert of the grove, The shelter of the stubble, or the brake! No more shall Autumn see her joyful rove, Echo no more her guiltless clamours wake. Oft too, the sportsman beats the country round, When silver frost impearls the shining glade; The lonely marsh, the hedge, the brambly ground, The ditch, and wood, that boasted once a shade. Quick glancing cross the vista's leafless view, Oft is the hare arrested in her flight; No more her early rambles to pursue, Or print the virgin snow with footstep light. In these bleak days, when Winter dreary reigns, When deep-wreath'd, glist'ning snows his call obey, Stretching with rapid swiftness o'er the plains, The needy greyhound tears his screaming prey. But why scenes foreign to our song describe, As if relax'd the triumphs of the gun? Enough here to depaint the feather'd tribe, Nor Mercy's ear with woes officious stun. What endless methods tyrant man invents His universal empire to assert! Seldom his eye, suffus'd with tears, relents, Seldom one throb of pity melts his heart! The death-charg'd gun, that scatters ruin round, To his fell rage for blood subservient made; The mastiff, ferret, terrier, and hound, The guileful net, the lure, the ambuscade. With these he ravages Creation through, Rock, mountain, cavern, valley, river, wood; Nothing lies hid from his officious view, No creature safe, if fit for sport or—food. See him, with uncommiserating heart, To seize, to slaughter, all his arts employ; No matter how forlorn, how keen their smart, If they have life, that life he must destroy. The mother from her helpless brood to snatch, To tear the consort from her fondling mate, How anxious some new mode of death to hatch? How high his glee! his boasts how meanly great! Oft does the woodcock, springing from the brake, Shot to the heart, drop from the frozen sky! The snipe, the wild-duck rising from the lake, The dove, the lapwing, heedless as they fly! Ah! how despis'd their gold-emburnish'd hue! Their glossy necks, and plumes of velvet! all Serve but to entertain the transient view, To grace their death, but not prevent their fall! Erewhile, each boasted his effulgent dyes, And dress'd his gaudy wings with faultless taste; Adorn'd the pond, incumbent wing'd the skies, Or, in gay throngs, the slated palace grac'd. Erewhile, with tender and assiduous care, By faithful instinct accurately taught, Forewarn'd, their mansion-nests did they prepare; But now these rapt'rous scenes avail them nought. Such recollections ne'er one moment stay The cruel hand that perpetrates their woes; When the swift bullet speeds its rapid way, Vainly the spider's cobwebs interpose: For see, the finch, the linnet, and the thrush, Now meet, unmeriting, one common doom, Conven'd unnumber'd on the crouded bush, Or hopping harmless through the naked broom. With steady look the fowler takes his aim, Quick from the flint the flashy lightning flies; Nor sooner is the powder wrapt in flame, Than, stain'd with blood, some noted songster dies. But spare, unthinking youth, the gentle race That usher in with songs the verdant Spring; Where they resort still sacred be the place, And undeform'd with gore each tabby wing. What else can charm our solitary hours, What else solace our pensive evening-walk, When the fond soul exerts her musing pow'rs, Tir'd with the dull impertinence of talk? Do they not rob themselves of sweet repose, To call us, loit'ring, from the arms of sleep? Do they not soothe us, when our eye-lids close, With gentlest airs, and tuneful vigils keep? Rather let birds of prey your wrath awake, Behold your poultry panting in their claws; Here merited and ample vengeance take, And thus assert the weaker's injur'd cause. PART III. HARE-HUNTING. Inscribed to Andrew-Thomas Stewart, Esq; Around Stewarthall's hereditary tow'rs, While you in graceful horsemanship excell, To exercise and health devote your hours, Behold describ'd the Sport you love so well. Far nobler thus your sacred time's employ'd, Than in State-policy's loud wrangling schools; Where, till a pension earn'd, or place enjoy'd, Men become downright knaves, tho' better fools. Where the description halts, or colours fail, Your recollection will the rest supply; Practice o'er Theory ever will prevail, When Judgment would their rival merits try. When the blythe songsters hail the rising morn, And scatter'd rays peep o'er each eastern hill; The huntsman rouses, with his winding horn, Each dormant echo from her slumbers still. The jocund summons wakes the drousy hounds, They start, they shake, they snuff the early dawn; Each little heart with expectation bounds, Anon to pant along the dewy lawn. Hark! what loud peals break on the ravish'd ear Of music's noblest sounds!—up, sportsman, up; Sleep's dalliance longer to provoke forbear, Wan-cheek'd disease lurks in her opiate cup: But flies, with all her pale consumptive train, The hardy youth that leads an active life; His mind from spleen, his body free from pain, He feels no languor, and he knows no strife. Up then, rejoic'd Creation calls aloud, Nor waste your hours in Sloth's ignoble arms; Now in the court the deep-ton'd beagles croud, Whose melody upbraids you, while it charms. Fresh from his crib the neighing steed is led, Majestic, and exulting in his strength; With haughty fling he tosses up his head, Waving in curls his mane of graceful length. With many a fiery glance his eye rolls round, He champs the bit, and paws the stone-pav'd way; Pricks his expanded ears at ev'ry sound, And all his dauntless soul resigns to play. Strait, from a seat encompass'd wide about With lofty elms, secluded from the day, The youthful crew advance, with jovial shout, And pause, and wonder, that so long they lay. Blooming with health, and cheerful as the morn, By exercise from bile and vapours freed, Pitying the man to female softness born, With salient step each mounts his shining steed. Onward they move, an active num'rous train, Each puny elegance of life forgot; While, to the early horn's enliv'ning strain, Echo re-answers from her vocal grot. Now, on the verge of Heav'n's cerulean height, The sun arriv'd, looks boundless joy around; Shooting abroad long dazzling streams of light, Bright'ning ten thousand dew-drops on the ground. His beams inspire delight before unknown, And throw a novel charm on ev'ry place; Each looks and smiles, as if he fill'd a throne, His bliss, his all, concent'red in the Chace. In distinct roving parties they divide, Each has his station and his task assign'd; Ambitious each, a no ignoble pride, To leave his fellows loit'ring far behind. One beats the brambly thicket's pendent sprays, No bush, no hole, his strict survey escapes; O'er the wide field another ceaseless strays, A third his way through whins or rushes shapes. The search though tedious, yet no youth complains, Around the song, the jest, the laugh prevail; The flutt'ring hare yet in her den remains, Nor prints the grass, nor warms the loaded gale. She listens from her once secure retreat, Peeps cautious forth, with her own rustling stunn'd; Returns then, trembling, to her lonely seat, Alas! ere long as passionately shunn'd. Inviron'd ah! with foes on ev'ry side, Her heart melts down with terrour and amaze; Where from impending danger can she hide? Death threats in ev'ry project she essays. With pangs of recollection and despair, She ponders on her wonted hours of joy, Unbounded when she stray'd devoid of care, No blood-hound near, rapacious to destroy: When no sounds discrepant swell'd on the breeze, But music from a hawthorn's flow'ry seat; The restless hum of honey-sipping bees, The chirp of grasshopper, or lambkin's bleat. This heightens her distress, augments her pain, Her bosom with deep woes already torn; Desp'rate, distracted, all delay in vain, She steals away, abandon'd and forlorn. Through many a brake she flies, and range of trees, Too many paths her trait'rous footsteps press; Her safety is betray'd in every breeze, Her flight discover'd on each blade of grass. Full on the track the stanch-nos'd dogs advance, Catching the strong effluvias as they fly; While the flush'd huntsmen bless the happy chance, And mark the dubious maze with ravish'd eye. Like lightning o'er the mossy glebe they speed, Warm and more warm inhale the tainted dew; Too well unrav'ling all her tracks succeed, And gain upon her, now in obvious view. Swift, and transported, o'er the level lawn, With loosen'd rein the rapid courser flies; Ne'er yet by puny art of sculpture drawn, Art somewhat still remote from life implies. His mighty soul disdaining to be last, Still in the front he quickens his career; The marsh, drain, precipice, and quickset past, No obstacle can strike his soul with fear. Fierce and impatient, all on fire he glows, And drinks with greedy ears the jovial noise; Down his warm sides the stream effusive flows, Yet nought but triumph his big thought employs. But what fine form attracts the Muse's eye, Mounted on yonder steed of dappled brown? An angel, sure, descending from the sky, Ne'er mixes with the huntsman and the clown. A female form?—to elegance of taste, To delicacy, to refinement born! Let not the modest sex be thus disgrac'd, The banter of the other, or the scorn— Heav'n has affix'd the boundaries of sex, For each religiously to keep within, Else, all wise order wantonly perplex, Rebel 'gainst Reason, and 'gainst Nature sin. Can gentle love inspire that sturdy heart Which for the chace with awkward ardour pants? To be pursu'd be still the woman's part, If wishing to be something more than—aunts. But see, o'er yonder park, or stubbled plain, The fear-wing'd hare her eager course urge on, Stretch ev'ry limb, each active sinew strain, Though half her vigour spent, her courage gone. To yonder hill she presses up her way, Or headlong down precipitates her flight; Bleeds her soft bosom on the prickly spray, Bounces o'er the sunk fence, or hedge-fac'd height. Sometimes, with sly device, her last resort, She boldly plunges where some river flows; Or, warily describes (as oft in sport) A winding course, to over-reach her foes. Upon a little eminence she stands, Round drops of sweat pour down her darken'd face; Full to the gale her list'ning ear expands, Deafen'd with the loud thunder of the chace. In shelt'ring copse fain would she cease from toil, Fain rest her aching joints in soft repose, Or, lowly cow'ring on the furrow'd soil, Hope to escape her unrelenting foes. False expectation! nearer still they press, While deeper tones freight ev'ry breeze that blows; Echo seems mocking her extreme distress, And distant hills but multiply her woes. Once more she puts her safety in her flight, And unperceiv'd, dejected steals away; A furious hound disturbs her timid sight, In ev'ry shrub, in ev'ry rustling spray. From bush to bush, from haunt to haunt, she speeds, And flutt'ring visits all her well-known seats, Nor for a while approaching ruin heeds, So much enamour'd of her old retreats. But ah! delay augments her heart-felt pangs, The wide-mouth'd dogs their certain prize pursue— Now by a cobweb-thread her safety hangs— One last effort is all her strength can do. This she exerts, and reels with wild affright, Backward and forward, stagg'ring in her gait; Her sanguine murderers arriv'd in sight, And she unable to protract her fate. Dark, dark her visage looks—what rueful wo Lours on her blacken'd face, with wildness mix'd! Stupid with anguish, starting to and fro, Her large black eyes stare in their sockets fix'd. How terrible this moment of suspense! Her cries infantile pity seem to crave— What interposing hand will snatch her hence, Like gracious Heav'n beneficent to save! But, deaf to mercy, as the senseless rock, That hangs its shadow o'er the grumbling deep; Hard as the oak that braves the tempest's shock, With her loud screams their triumphs cadence keep. The bloody pack, hot-streaming, stretch along, In short quick heaves she languishes for breath; Close at her heels they growl, a hostile throng, With jaws wide-open'd for devouring death. Oppress'd she sinks—despair swells in her eye, Distraction bursts forth in a falling tear— Turn, turn aside, nor see the victim die! Ah! from her plaints avert the anguish'd ear! Harmless and meek, alas! what has she done, From tyrant man to meet a fate so hard? Let her fall victim to the loaded gun, If e'er with blood she stain'd the treasur'd yard. Rather the fox's dark retreats explore, Your skill oft will the wily knave elude; Nor your pursuit give impotently o'er, Till the arch thief dies for the public good. See him steal faithless, when night's shadows fall, Where your warm feather'd fam'ly roosting sit, When darkness hides his outrages from all, And frequent murder, join'd with theft, commit. Shall then your poultry the fell ruffian feed, Grown by successes bold, to blood inur'd; Nor yet the insolent assassin bleed, By crafty arts, and stratagems secur'd? But vainly would the weeping Muse engage Compassion to her woes—behold! they tear Her guiltless breast, with more than savage rage; Gentler the famish'd hound, or forest-bear. And while her dying sobs relief implore, Dash down her quiv'ring entrails on the ground, While dogs impure lick up the reeking gore, And men and steeds exulting gather round. Mangled she lies, stiff ev'ry springy limb, Wont to transport her o'er the less'ning plain; Her glaring eyes in death's cold languor dim, And all besmear'd with many a clotted stain. But let the numbers farther cease to flow, Haply, to sport enthusiastic swains, Blended too much with elegiac wo, The Muse when she should triumph, but complains. Yet, though the hardy, unreflecting heart Glows in the chace, as flints are fir'd by steel; Well may the Muse with confidence assert, That breast's not human which can never feel. If to extremes mankind may ever lean, (Our common fault, from meanness, or from pride) Howe'er our acts explain ill what we mean, The errour's surely best on Mercy's side. ON RICHES. ? Quid habet pulchri constructus acervus. Hor. Why is extensive wealth bestow'd on men? To be as greatly useful as they can, Not merely their own in'trests to pursue, Or meanly hoard as wretched misers do; Alas! while thousands of their betters starve, Or only have their barest wants to serve. God, in dispensing favours here below, Wisely dispens'd, would have all orders know, Howe'er the lots unequal seem to fall, He seeks the welfare not of one, but all. Not that a pride-swoln purse-vain tyrant, born Both the disgrace of mankind, and the scorn, Should raise, with unremitted bent of mind, His fortune on the ruins of his kind; Sole, rigid arbiter of right and wrong, Holding high jurisdiction o'er the throng; A pow'r which only from presumption flows, Or something foreign to himself bestows: His only merit—save but to himself, The merit of the mine, a little pelf, Though here unlike, his to himself confin'd, The mine bestows its blessings on mankind. All are the objects of God's special care, His Providence all undistinguish'd share; His rains and dews the barren soil enrich, No matter which the lord, the vassal which; His radiant sun, his moon, his stars, display To all one indiscriminating ray. The monarch and the hamlet's servile clown, Howe'er on him the royal eye looks down, Howe'er the first by prostrate crouds obey'd, Stand on a level, when by Him survey'd; For to the last, so equal He bestows, The first his diadem and sceptre owes; While in return, though casual ills endur'd, The peasant's life and property's secur'd. No titles, no distinctions, that exist Only while Fortune smiles, or factions list, Expos'd to accidents of time and place, Avail with Him whose empire is all space; Whose eye, which through no partial medium sees, Beholds, as one, all stations and degrees; As gilded clouds dispers'd o'er evening-sky, Some of a brighter, some a fainter dye, But all alike, at the approach of night, Snatch'd in surrounding darkness from the sight. For what are all the haughty boasts of pow'r, But the fantastic playthings of an hour, Which Fortune from her lap in pastime throws, While in the scramble friends turn mortal foes? So have we seen two mastiffs fierce engage, With rival hatred, and contentious rage, The strongest sure the mighty prize to own, The mighty prize—a crumble or a bone. Say not that Virtue suffers by the charge, We censure thus her merit to enlarge; Thus too applause on Reason we bestow, Reason, man's grand prerogative below; For seldom either seems concern'd at all With Mankind's incidental rise or fall; Seldom the last claims Pity's tender sigh, The first one glance of their approving eye. Refrain to call their honour injur'd then, But let the censure justly light on men. Men who, when plumes or stars within their reach, Think no excess a law's notorious breach; Surmount each obstacle, as in their way An insect flutter'd, or a molehill lay; The first that can obtain, or best defend, (No matter how) most lucky in the end. Rather pronounce the satire dipt in gall, That thus their favour is denied to all. And why denied? because (O lasting blot In Fame's escutcheon) priz'd and courted not. Riches, consider'd right, are not our own, But lent us as a temporary loan, To be, as the fam'd Hebrew understood, Laid out discreetly for the common good. A certain test, a grand criterion this, As manag'd with discretion, or amiss, God in superiour wisdom means to try The rectitude of our intentions by; Whence the reward, or glory or disgrace, Will with impartial equity take place. Such then reverse the universal law, Whose hearts relent not, and whose hands withdraw. Such counteract Heav'n's uniform design, And boldy would oppose the will divine, Who, to the circle of themselves confin'd, Their thoughts extend not to the human kind; Whom no kind gen'rous sentiments impress, Averse to aid, though they the means possess. For shame! thus faithless to the noblest trust, To God ungrateful, and to man unjust. To God, of whom unmerited you hold Your lease of life, your honours, and your gold. To man, related by one common tye, Whate'er proud mottoes boast, or crests imply. Reason, to man intrusted as a grant, Lest he should ever sink oppress'd with want, Makes him the common creditor of all, Whate'er hard fate betides, or ills befall. To whom all, places chang'd, commutual owe What each would wish the other to bestow. A diamond is a diamond, whether seen On dunghill, or in bracelet of a queen. Yon sun the same, when vapours foul obscure, As when he shines through boundless æther pure. For shall a being form'd by breath divine, In whom the graces of an angel shine, Destin'd, when life's vain senseless farce is o'er, To live with kindred spirits evermore, Shall he, unhonour'd by a gen'rous sigh, Live unassisted, or neglected die? Shall he alone demand his birth-right due, Yet, with reproach, meet a refusal too? No; first the open air let glow-worms shun; Lest in his glory they eclipse the sun; Let wretches guard their bags with bolted door, Starving with plenty, in abundance poor. Let emmets boast their hoarded grains, but man Should act upon a better, nobler plan. Nor let the bard, who freely censures them, Be guilty of a fault his lays condemn. Thus would he take the disingenuous side, And from his actions his belief divide. From PHANOR, A Lover with a small Patrimony, To CONSTANTIA, His wealthy Mistress, whom he admired before he was apprised of her Fortune, An EPISTLE. Amor vincit ? Ovid. The hand, O ever-charming fair, Whence this epistle, will declare. O could it in your breast excite One soft idea of delight! Ah why on you did Fortune smile, Yet sternly frown on me the while? Why did she wealth refuse to pour Propitious on my natal hour? Or, since her bounty here confin'd, To you why lavishly so kind? Had you been born a rural maid, To grace the ivy-mantled shade; To hear the music-warbling throng, Or, by your own, excel their song; Simple in manners and in dress, Yet doubly charming ne'er the less: Then had, like me, some youthful swain Approach'd, nor met with cold disdain, But welcom'd, in Love's courteous style, With placid brow, and gracious smile. Approach'd, and of success secure, Which Wealth might bribe, but ne'er ensure; That union of congenial hearts, Which time cements, and death but parts, For which not power nor fame atones; Scarce envy'd monarchs on their thrones: You, fairest nymph that tript the plain, And he the kindest fondest swain! You yielding with a blush of joy, He clasping charms that never cloy! O lovely maid (on whose account, No good would to my wish amount) Possess'd of beauty, youth, and health, For once divest yourself of wealth. Health, youth, and beauty, in their prime, Should lose in vain resolves no time; Though Virtue without them may please, Virtue is still set off by these. Health, youth, and beauty, one by one, Are Virtue's outward suits put on; Becoming, when she leaves the skies, Thus visible to mortal eyes. Prudence forbids those charms to fade, Which blooming come to Virtue's aid; Without which, she were sure to know Less admiration still below. While some would prostitute their charms To a vile sordid husband's arms; At the unfeeling shrine of pelf, Each meanly sacrifice herself; Affect, for titles, or degree, Wretched through a long life to be: Nature doth you with power invest Of blessing, and of being blest; True happiness was never sold, Nor bought by mercenary gold. Had I a fortune at command, To make acceptable my hand; That offer'd hand, did you incline, That fortune, Charmer, should be thine. Nor would I challenge, on my part, Aught as the purchase but your heart. What you had seen perform'd by me, May I in turn expect from thee? Were you less lovely in mine eye, Riches could ne'er that loss supply. Worth your regard if me you judge, Scorn my mere want of pelf to grudge. Enough already you possess, Another and yourself to bless; Some Youth whom merit recommends, Not mouldy rent-rolls, or court-friends, Those splendid enemies to love, When sense and virtue fail to move: More might in vain parade be spent, But nought could add to real content. Left to determine your own state, Rather be happy, than be great. Those who have neither choice, nor will, If such mistake, are pitied still. But pity's to that maid deny'd, By no compulsive methods try'd; From numbers who's allow'd to chuse, Approve uncensur'd, or refuse. But O! while others force confines, Sole mistress of your own designs, Mistress of that important part, Where all should first consult the heart; If constancy and truth can please, In me, sweet maid, o'erlook not these! In no bold confidence of style, If gentle manners court your smile, O kindly pardon the attempt, And me from blame pronounce exempt! Pity a heart sincere, that would Fix your regard; yet not intrude, That would, in your's and candour's ears, Express its wishes, hopes, and—fears; To you, for friendship form'd and love, Each thought, each sentiment approve. That heart, ills fated to endure, Wounded by you, but you can cure. The ANSWER. Fortuna vincit. Your letter I receiv'd, dear swain, But the address is all in vain. In vain the pow'rs of verse essay To make black white, or midnight day. Money has charms; let parsons preach, Their lives far other doctrines teach. Gold you would undervalue: right; Little, my swain, you have to slight. His foxship scorn'd the grapes as sour, Because—remov'd beyond his pow'r. That you have merit, is most true, Talents and virtues, not a few; But these, with person, youth, and health, Are poor equivalents for wealth. Beside, you doubtless must confess, These I as well as you possess. Say then, alike accomplish'd thus, What's offer'd for my overplus? Rather would I a title wed, Than take mere merit to my bed. Mere merit, in mere private life, Mere Love's, or Friendship's simple strife, May figure; but how awkward still, And disconcerted at—quadrille? Riches already I may vaunt, A title's only what I want. A title makes the vulgar gaze, Commands respect at balls and plays; O'erawes the bailiff, and takes place Where Virtue still—shows not her face; Than which, with wealth, nought we possess More truly good—but happiness. Perhaps, when twoscore years are past, If your regard so long can last, No coronet, in all that space, Obtain'd, no Ladyship, no Grace; With a bold favour'd lover's ease, You may approach me—if you please. Meantime farewell, keep hope in store, Twice twenty springs will soon pass o'er. PROLOGUE, Spoken at the Representation of the Recruiting-Officer, by the young Gentlemen of Dungannon in Ireland; the profits of which were appropriated to relieve the necessities of the poor, during the almost universal scarcity of the year 1757. This night, untutor'd for the buskin'd stage, Alike (alas) regarding skill and age, A comic play we offer to your view, Humbly submitting our attempts to you. If they your favour and applause obtain, Your grateful debtors largely we remain; If not, the good intention will ensure Success, what our deserts can ne'er procure. The gen'rous bosom, and the feeling heart, Will plead excuse for each defective part. See yonder wretches (let their cries prevail) The starving mother with her children pale! Misfortune pictur'd in each ghastly look! Almost by gracious Heav'n itself forsook! In each sunk feature misery is trac'd, Humanity's own image near defac'd. Hard penury chills ev'ry torpid heart, And nought but anguish their swoln sighs impart. Clouds of despondence hang on each sad brow, And big despair half forms the horrid vow. Distressful times!—say, can the Muse behold The triumphs joint of hunger and of cold, And yet suppress the sympathetic sigh, Yet stop the tear that trickles from the eye; Those genuine tributes on soft Pity's side, When others more substantial are deny'd? With Plenty's loaded board to feast the eye, Us'd only want and wretchedness to spy; On each wan cheek to paint Health's roseate bloom, And bid each look its wonted smile assume; Life's last remains of vigour to preserve, Strengthen the limb, and brace anew the nerve; Thus ev'ry breast with gratitude to fire, And with delight the melting heart inspire; Can true Ambition e'er the mind dispose To worthier deeds, to nobler acts than those? Such claim the highest honours as their due, And such not vainly we expect from You. EPILOGUE On the same Occasion. If ever play an epilogue deserv'd, For acting which from justness never swerv'd, That now presented (cries some waggish elf) Speaks with convincing merit for itself; Though Charity the palm of virtues wins, As she conceals a multitude of sins. What native strokes of genius, to surprise The most unthinking hearts, and careless eyes! What easy attitudes! what graceful shapes! Which self-vain affectation vainly apes. What apt behaviour! what exact address! As if it were not human to transgress. How with the comic muse their bosoms burn'd! With what just emphasis their periods turn'd! Which show'd, beyond the strongest proofs of art, True eloquence is seated in the heart. Had present but the British Roscius been, Their fine display of talents to have seen, He had confess'd, though oft in boasts detected, He never could, indeed, like them have acted. From evils often of the largest size Some accidental good we see arise. Thus, in the midst of scarcity and need, When universal famine seem'd decreed, A set of worthies rose to our relief, Dispell'd our fears, and mollify'd our grief. Had plenty still charm'd our delighted sight, We had not seen this matchless play to-night. Ladies, your breasts with admiration mov'd, Justly have you each actor's skill approv'd; For only they so greatly could excel, And only you distinguish worth so well. To the Author of Douglas and Agis. Written in the year 1758. Hail, tragic bard! still while esteem remains For nature painted in the purest strains; While sentiments express'd with native ease, And elegant simplicity can please; While poesy and taste maintain their cause, Douglas shall live the subject of applause. How Agis shines, drawn by thy faithful pen, The greatest, wisest, and the best of men! When sacred Freedom fires his glowing breast, Each less exalted gen'rous aim supprest; How does he rise, deserted and alone, Superiour to the grandeur of a throne, Unsooth'd by Pleasure's fascinating voice, The coward's boast, the slave's ignoble choice! Proud Cæsar, seated in triumphal car, Amid the trophies and the spoils of war, While adoration crouds almost bestow, Exhibits to mankind a meaner show. Britain, awake; a finish'd picture see, Drawn by the Muse's happiest art, for thee; Not merely to amuse, but to inspire With virtuous zeal, and patriotic fire. To rouse from sloth thy once heroic race, Sloth, still the harbinger of quick disgrace; Rouse them, at Glory's oft-repeated call, To live like heroes, or like heroes fall. Britain!—too much resembling Sparta's state, When few had the ambition to be great; When luxury, intemperance, and ease, Had only the successful power to please; When Party and Corruption, with deep stealth, Plann'd basely to o'erturn the Commonwealth. May such Plays only grace the British stage, As tend to better and improve the age; Tend, by each manly, noble, lib'ral art, To fire the genius, and enlarge the heart; Which heroes, and which patriots may admire, Virtue approve, and Liberty inspire. Now Caledonia lifts her aged head, Long buried with the literary dead, And, from the slumber of a hundred years, Upon the top of Helicon appears. She comes, to greet you her peculiar son, To hail your race of glory now begun, Such glory as Parnassian laurels claim, Beyond the honours of a titled name. Long Scotia's sons were famous in the field, For might and prowess that could never yield. Immortal trophies long adorn'd her land, Nobly achiev'd by Valour's stoutest hand. Through distant nations spread her martial name, And Scotia and renown were still the same. Scarce did her children leave the dandling knee, By Nature warlike, as by Nature free, When ev'ry little hand essay'd to wield The spear, or train the courser for the field; Anon to lead forth armies on the foe, Conquest and death attending ev'ry blow. No music could transport them but alarms, No exercise was popular but arms. The wretch that liv'd in indolence and ease, Whom dangers could affright, and softness please; Was fain to deserts from mankind to fly, In senseless glooms to shun the public eye. But though for warriours, vet'ran warriours, fam'd, Few favourites there the gentle Muses claim'd; Save the restorer of the classic phrase, Whose eulogy has half exhausted praise Buchanan.. Save Johnston, not ungratefully here past, Nor Thomson, whose fresh laurels ever last. Nor virtuous Blacklock, though depriv'd of sight, And shrouded in the rayless gloom of night, To whose soul Reason shines with purest rays, And mental Beauty's ev'ry charm displays. But now her name, wide as her conquests flew, Shall boundless spread, spread by the Muse and You. CROSS A beautiful rural retirement near Strabane in the county of Tyrone, Ireland.. Errare per lucos, amœnæ Quos et aquæ subeunt, et auræ. Hor. This sylvan Seat, which lofty trees surround, Stands on the summit of a rising ground, Whence all the varied landscape is survey'd, In Nature's richest drapery array'd. Hard by, two sloping sister hills ascend, Whose ample sides from the rude storm defend; Along whose slantings Plenty's ever seen, In yellow liv'ry rob'd, or em'rald green. Feeding on summer's fragrant bloom at large, Here the blythe shepherd tends his fleecy charge; Pores on the ballad, from ambition free, Or cheats the lengthen'd hours in harmless glee; Breathes, from the simple flagellet's soft throat, The sprightly air, or tender plaintive note; His little dog asleep, or barking round At some stray sheep, or unaccustom'd sound. Before the door, in apt arrangement plac'd, With all the truest elegance of taste, Of ev'ry odour, each resplendent dye, Beds of selected flow'rs green-border'd lie: Where the jonquil, anemone, and rose, Their silken bosoms to the sun disclose; Tulips, in robes of gaudy crimson bright, And lilies conscious of their snowy white; Pansies, diversify'd with various hues, And hyacinths bedropt with silver dews; Pinks and carnations, delicately gay, Flush'd with the virgin smiles that gild the day; Ranunculus, in radiant scarlet clad, And fair Narcissus, hung his love-sick head: A splendid, num'rous, variegated tribe, Which scarce the Florist can himself describe; All that perfumes the zephyr's lenient wing, Or blushes on the verdant lap of Spring. From this, with more of elegance than state, Through the kind entrance of a portal'd gate, A flight of polish'd steps leads, by degrees, To a long range of venerable trees, Where oaks, and elms, and ashes, seem to vie In fond ambition to approach the sky; Forming a kindly umbrage, to allure Spring's warblers, from fell truant's grasp secure. Below, a river's limpid currents glide, Bounded by mossy banks on either side; Now, like a liquid pavement, smooth and still, When not a pebble forms the gurgling rill; No murmur rolls its burden on the wind, To soothe the heavy heart, the anxious mind; Impetuous now, full-charg'd, abrupt and hoarse, From the cleft rocky steep, with headlong force, While deep-shook caverns swell the mighty roar, In broken whirls it sweeps, and thunders o'er. Here lies a spacious garden, richly stor'd With all that Art or Nature can afford Of roots, and herbs, to grace the healthful dish, What Want requires, what Temperance can wish. Diffusive there, and bending with their load, (Rich fruitage by Autumnal suns bestow'd) Variety of trees connect their shade, Till all one arch'd capacious covert made: Some that support the apple's juicy race, On whose ripe cheeks the virgin's blush we trace; Others with mellow pears luxuriant hung, That melt in pulpy fatness on the tongue; While numbers boast the damson and the peach, Soft to the touch, and dropping to the reach. Hail wholesome viands! hail ambrosial food! What can the royal cook present so good, Though foreign climes their costly meats afford, To spread with luxury the monarch's board; Though wines high-flavour'd sparkle in his cup, As if mere wines could keep the spirits up? These are the baneful sources of disease, And Siren-like, but to destroy us, please; But those, which fed the ancient Patriarch sage, Protract life to a happy good old age. Here, when the songsters, from each pensile spray, Sing the last exit of departing day; Or when bright Morn looks round with radiant eyes, To chase Night's length'ned shadows from the skies; Oft does the Muse from noisy scenes retire, Wafted on Contemplation's wing of fire; Wander unnumber'd pleasing objects o'er, Till Observation can supply no more. From earth to heav'n oft elevates her view, Still in the keen pursuit of something new. To yonder sun's meridian bow'r ascends, Whence through Creation's confines life extends; Now to the silver majesty of night, Diffusing round the softer streams of light; Now to the circlet of each lucid star, Whose splendours reach unmeasurably far: Amaz'd that globes, in systems clust'ring strung, Globes, pendulous in fluid æther hung, Globes, of enormous weight, and heat, and size, Should each maintain its station in the skies; Nor sweep eccentric, from its orbits hurl'd, Through the vast void, and conflagrate a world! Grand proof of Pow'r Almighty, that restrains Those pond'rous masses by magnetic chains, Obnoxious else, each moment of the day, To anarchy, to uproar, and decay. Sometimes, the flow'rs bedropt with pearls of dew, The tears of Nature, at light's last adieu; Sometimes the rich enamel of the fields, Where all of sweet and fair kind Nature yields; Sometimes the fruit dependent from the trees, Loading with sweets the intermingled breeze; Sometimes, the smiling azure of the sky, Streak'd o'er with fleecy gold, attracts her eye. Now the mild whispers of the dying breeze, Breathing faint sighs through sympathetic trees; Martlets in ceaseless flight, and clamour loud, Winging the liquid sky, a feather'd cloud; The bleat of sheep, some folded, straggling some, Or hornet, wheeling round with drousy hum; Now the soft warblings of the vocal tribe, As they their little feather'd loves describe; Doom'd no keen anguish from remorse to bear, Courts the attention of her ravish'd ear. Say, ye immur'd in towns, what can compare With flow'ry verdure and the open air? What strains of labour'd music can surprise The captive sense, and mount us to the skies, Like that which hails Aurora's gladsome ray, Or mourns the absence of the god of day? Erewhile, not Handel's more than mortal art To move the noblest feelings of the heart; Though every passion, each sublime desire Wak'd, as his fingers swept the living lyre, Could imitate the ear-inchanting lays, That from the shade swell the Creator's praise. To catch Health floating on the zephyr's wings, Or gushing from the rock's pellucid springs; Distilling odours from the flow'ry bed, Or smiling mead, with new-mown hay o'erspread; With active vigour bracing the strong limb, While with the stream's translucent tide we swim; Mount the swift steed, and scour the tainted ground, While the loud horn wakes ev'ry echo round; Shoot the fleet arrow from the trembling string, Or joyous grace the festive rural ring: Kings might for these their drawing-rooms forego, And prove their greatness by contempt of show. This world is nothing, if to us unkind In health of body, and in peace of mind. Without them monarchs seem with want opprest, Rustics, with them, of more than crowns possest. Would Heav'n but grant me my supreme desire, That state I wish, that mansion I admire; Not with proud courts would I affect to mix, But here at once my hopes and dwelling fix. Here, with a chosen set of worthy friends, Whom harmony of tempers recommends, Union of souls and sympathy of hearts, Which years but rivet, and but death disparts; Prefer simplicity to splendid ease, My sole ambition to be pleas'd, and please. Here, when life's dying lamp was gradual spent, No murmur heard of fretful discontent, Approving Conscience my alone solace, Smoothing to smiles Pain's agonizing face; Heave the last draught that feeds my fainting breath, Welcome my latest pang, and triumph over death. On the Ruins of an old ELM. ? Arbores loquantur, non tantum feræ. Phæd. Hail! ag'd remains of what thou once hast been, When, mantled o'er with vernal foliage green, For stature thy fair form unrival'd stood, The landscape's pride, and monarch of the wood. O did a spark of Pope's unequall'd fire The elegiac numbers but inspire, From thy bare stump the laurel should arise, And thou once more affect sublime the skies! What revolutions, in life's strange affairs, In stations, places, fortunes, studies, cares, Hast thou beheld, since first thy infant root Did deep in earth its tender fibrils shoot! To portray all, whate'er the well-earn'd praise, In pointed numbers, and in faithful lays, Would occupy the fam'd Horatian quill, Yet (strange) the catalogue imperfect still; Or his, at once his subject and his claim, Who sung the general passion, love of fame. Yet shall the muse, content with aiming well, Attempt a theme where others may excell. Say, since thy birth, what undertakings plann'd, What armies rais'd—a rumour to withstand. In seas of their own blood what millions drown'd, What battles fought—about an inch of ground. What furies veil'd in sacerdotal gown, Sent from below to turn worlds upside-down. What arts a stain on merit to affix, What villains wafted in a coach and six, Thousands of Virtue's sons obscurely born, Haply, the humblest stations to adorn. What midnight lamps consum'd—a day to fix, What learning spent—that three and three make six. What spleen—our merit suffers by compare. What noble goodly structures—built in air. To hide us—from ourselves, what treble bars, What marks of honour—in love's glorious wars. What tours to distant regions—in the brain. What contests to support—a harlot's train. What engines rear'd—a rocket to expel. What kingly favour shown—for pimping well. What godlike acts of bounty—to be seen. What grand contrivances—a knave to screen. What pomp of language—to describe a dance. What great resolves—in fashion to advance. What factions form'd—to discompose a stage, What laws to mend—the gaming of the age. What gen'rous friendship—to ourselves avow'd. What dignity of look—his Lordship bow'd. What fortunes mortgag'd—that a horse may run. What striking talents—to compose a pun. What dreadful terrours—for a midge's sting. What sums expended—on an insect's wing. What loud laments—a monkey to bewail, What grief—for trampling on a lap-dog's tail. What freedoms us'd by each fierce son of thunder, Resolv'd—his sword and sheath shall never sunder. With what audacious haughty front he struts, Like yonder bull against some tree that butts! By method valiant, and by piece-meal brave, How much unlike himself would he behave! To Clodia, see how quick revers'd his plan, For Clodia, like a hero, kill'd his man! Not so mild Ned, he ne'er his rapier gor'd, And hence is threaten'd by each poltroon's sword. But let the muse to other objects turn, With indignation and with anger burn, While she but narrates, in impartial rhyme, What pass'd when mankind saw thee in thy prime. To settle faith what sanguine crouds in arms. What set devotions paid—to Circe's charms. What recollection—at a tart reply. What manly boldness—to maintain a lie. What high debates—to fix a stallion's price. What strength of reasoning—to defend a vice. What strong foretastes of Heav'n, what perfect bliss, What chaste enjoyments—in a strumpet's kiss. What looks of dark design, not to disclose A mighty secret—which all mankind knows. What cordial shakes, with many a gen'rous vaunt, What promises—to those who nothing want. What looks of honest meaning—to beguile. What years attendance to obtain—a smile. What learn'd advice—a freckled brow to cure, What Christian calm—a pimple to endure. What pious multitudes to church repair, To take their godly nap, or see the Fair. How ev'ry night long Sarco's fam'ly pray, For he defrauds his customers all day. Vano how like a saint, none really more, Just now the doctor gave poor Vano o'er. How Casto's voice in talking seldom sinks, For the best reason, Casto never thinks. How furious Marcia, stamping on the floor, Poor George (black crime) forgot to shut the door. What obloquy—Aurelia seeks the shade. What cruel jests—Amanda's roses fade. What endless sighs—not that Aspasia's ill, But O! the doctor—kept her from quadrille. What joyful looks (apart) what triumphs vast, Just now Almira's husband—breath'd his last. How wedlock women—of fourteen adore. How self-deny'd to marriage—full threescore. How meek Fastidia gen'rously would wed, Could she but take a coronet to bed; While Chloe ventures on a man downright, For O—! he danc'd most charmingly last night. How many maids to marry still delay, Because (alas) no husband comes their way; Because (at the mere thought Compassion starts) If wed, whole scores would die of broken hearts! But who can travel through the maze of life, Its little contests, bustlings, cares, and strife, Hopes, wishes, fears, in quick rotation seen Thy vernal bloom and thy decline between? Sooner the eye may Spring's cast blossoms count, Or leaves in Autumn's whirling blasts that mount. But now alas! thy glory is no more, Thy glory wont each season to restore. How emblematic of man's common doom, Man, so conceited of his nodding plume; Like thee, to see a few short summers glide, Then be disrob'd of all his gorgeous pride; Small space between, howe'er his prospects tow'r, His rites funereal and his natal hour! Shall mortals then on length of years depend, And stretch out life almost without an end; To fortune, strength, to youth, or beauty trust, To rescue, or detain, them from the dust; When Elms themselves, with all their proud display Of branchy verdure, wither and decay? Elms, that can brave the Winter's northern blast, But by Time's stronger hand subdu'd at last. To Doctor AKENSIDE. An EPISTLE. Say, Akenside, by the chaste Muse inspir'd, And first among Fame's classic sons admir'd; Say, why the lyre so backward to resume, Unaw'd by ev'ry meaner poet's doom; When glory courts your patriotic lays, Bourbon's submission, and Britannia's praise. Say, would your fancy soar, your bosom burn? To Ocean's empress, wreath'd with laurel, turn; Albion the fair! victorious o'er her foes, Whose smile now universal peace bestows. If any sparks, struck from celestial fire, Your kindling Muse to ravishment inspire, (And that there are, is echo'd back by fame) Each great exploit will mount them up to flame. The true-born sons of Genius we behold Turn all beneath their magic touch to gold; With them, whate'er the arduous task decreed, But barely to attempt, is to succeed. The sun but glimmers, while a cloud confines, Light forms in prisms, and yonder rainbow shines. Save then, from sordid scribblers of the age, Who blot with worse than ink the sacred page; Who with no genius, and with ears as bad, Affect to run poetically mad; Drawl out their expletives to form a rhyme, The couplet good, if but the last words chyme: Or, if they scorn the fetters Dryden chose, Range through a chaos wild of blank-verse-prose. From such unworthy candidates for fame, Whom Pity's self can scarce as objects claim; Like Mercy, all beneficent to save, O! snatch Britannia's Heroes—from the grave. For shall exploits, that ask no meaner pen, Than his who sung inspir'd of arms and men; Shall they be murder'd by that wretch's quill, Who breaks Heaven's great command, “Thou shalt not kill?” Exploits, the Julian æra that renew, Worthy of Wolfe, who fell, but conquer'd too! Shall the proud sons of battle, Albion's sons, In whose high veins the blood of heroes runs; Shall they, whose thunders on fam'd Minden roar'd, Fall by the hand of Dulness undeplor'd! Forbid it, Gratitude—that loudly claims Trophies of praise to their heroic names! Forbid it, Freedom—while immortal fame Through ages spreads thy poet's honour'd name! Forbid it, Akenside—while Edwards stand, Till now, unrivall'd glories of our land; While you Imagination's pow'rs inspire With Plato's feeling, and with Pindar's fire! To Mr WOTY; On his publishing the Poetical Calendar. What numbers with unhallow'd hands delight To nip the bud of Genius ere full-blown! Or to repress, with little sordid spite, Fancy's strong pinion that sublime had flown! Far gentler the rude flash of lightning past, That struck the eagle from his tow'ring wing! Less cruel riots Winter's ruffian blast On the soft virgin bosom of the Spring! But satire ne'er shall our chaste page defile, Let their just fate suffice—to die forgot— Now let the frown be soften'd to a smile, Worth claims applause, though she solicits not. Late did the hand of Elegance select Each flow'r o'er Albion scatter'd by the Muse; And hence in Attic taste a nosegay deckt, Whose beauty time revolving but renews Alluding to Mr Dodsley's very elegant collection of Poems.. So, from the pathless solitary waste, The gay parterre oft borrows half its pride; See! yonder terrace with those snow-drops grac'd, That rudely once adorn'd the landscape wide. To You a like return of praise belongs, That now the Muses grace our native land; Ye friends of bards, and guardians of their songs, By no mean breath the fire poetic fann'd. These Volumes as fair monuments shall last, “What gems had lain neglected in the mine, “Had you not here the precious store amass'd, “To charm by union, and by contrast shine.” On HARMONY. Inscribed to Mr Robert Stevenson. Dulci laborem decipitur sono. Hor. Accept these lines, my brother, and my friend, If kindly you approve, not vainly penn'd. Yet all the strongest colourings are faint, To one who feels beyond what words can paint. Music has charms peculiar to a man Whose life is form'd on Harmony's own plan; Whose actions, and their motives, ever run With Virtue's laws in happy unison. Still persevere—then shall the numbers be From ev'ry charge of partial friendship free. But wherefore partial, since it is confest, They worth most justly praise, who know it best? Him to commend not, for pure morals fam'd, Is an express affront at Virtue aim'd. Besides, praise to ingenuous minds, creates What, by assumption, it already rates; As the same sun-beam, that adorns the flow'r, Matures its lenient sweets and healing pow'r. Hail, Harmony! hail, native of the skies, Where thou art wont before the throne to rise, On golden harp, with angels all on flame, To celebrate the dread Eternal Name! Seraphic charmer, hail! to man sent down To soften into smiles Misfortune's frown: Sent down the joys of Eden to restore, His pledge of higher, when life's drama's o'er; When, from the dross of elements refin'd, He lives all pure and unembodied mind; With spirits lives, whose vast durations run Thro' ages never ended, still begun. Spirits, like him, once in probation tried, To matter, though in different mode, allied; In higher ranks, by no first stain disgrac'd, Of intuition, thought, and reason plac'd. There, heav'n-taught art! in Glory's native clime, Thy touches of the tender, and sublime, The sweet, the grand, the melting, and the soft, That languish, or majestic swell aloft, With uncreated energy of sound, Shall make infinitude of space rebound; Rouse to high flame Devotion's hallow'd fires, A flame, heart-kindled flame, that ne'er expires; Which to an angel the mere mortal turns, And only in celestial bosoms burns. Hail! living type of man design'd to be, When all his various active pow'rs agree; Or, join'd with discord, aptly to define His complex nature, earthly and divine: Discord his emblem, when his passions jar, And rage tumultuous in eternal war! Each passion acts obsequious to thy pow'r, Rises or falls, in the same conscious hour; While human skill, in impotent essays, Would labour that to calm, or this to raise. Vengeance sits brooding o'er the darken'd face, In sullen gloom eclips'd each social grace; Or, shrinking from the rash vindictive vow, Smiles sweet Forgiveness with an angel's brow. Anger within indomitable storms, And all the ruffled countenance deforms; Or Meekness, mov'd not by the harsh reply, Softens each beam that vibrates from the eye. When all the charms of oratory fail To rouse the soul, thy pathos can prevail. Let Cicero his wordy thunder wield, If Orpheus plays, the Roman boast must yield. That vigour to a senate-house might give, This made ev'n things inanimate to live. When Reason, on her dictatorial throne, Argues and pleads, with undecisive tone; Thy rhetoric of sound, beyond her aid, Thy lyre-breath'd strains of language can persuade. Oh! at that crisis of alarming fate, Just to commence a new eternal state; When, like a broken reed, or trembling asp, All human comfort sinks beneath my grasp; When friends, suffus'd in sorrow and despair, Express their anguish, but no hopes declare, With downcast looks, and sighs-returning breath, Adding a dread solemnity to death: Oh! by Religion made a welcome guest, Thy habitation, seraph, be my breast, To soothe the spirit, soon its flight to wing, And to each thought celestial requiems sing! To Miss J?y T?tt?r, Appearing often at her Window with her Hat on. An EPISTLE. Say, J?y, ne'er in vapours gone, Why still your Kitty Fisher on, How'er unnecessary made, By the warm room's protecting shade? Do you this stratagem practise, Lest we be dazzled with your eyes? The kind intent we grateful own, And thank the umbrage o'er them thrown. But, though we venture not to gaze At yonder sun in noon-tide blaze, We wish no intervening cloud The radiance of his orb to shroud. Perhaps, as specks obscure the gem, Some languor rudely seizes them. On me O let your suffrage fall! O me your special doctor call! Art, haply, may relief afford, Each eye's soft lambent fires restor'd. How bless'd, how envied would I be, Were those fine orbs renew'd by me, Though the bright ray, when back it came, Might kindle all my soul to flame! Me would you then your patient see, And you, in turn, physician be; No fee from either party due, You might cure me, for curing you. But ah! the heart, when ills surprise, Is cur'd less easy than the eyes! Miss G?tt to the Author; With a Pocket-book she had renewed. Go, little book, renew'd by me, And to thy master tell, That, for my pains bestow'd on thee, I hope he'll use thee well. This further I would have thee say, Though he may merit less; I as his friend will ever pray, And wish him all success. His ANSWER. Yes, little book, by her renew'd, Thou shalt be treated well; O! wert thou but with speech endu'd, And could the Charmer tell, That I accept her as my friend, With fond intent to prove, Friendship with women, in the end Is sister but to love. A QUESTION: Sacred to the learned body of Quacks. Doctors, except just now and then, Seem longer-liv'd than other men, Though largely they, like all, great sinners, Indulge at suppers, and at dinners, And, from restraints like others freed, In the non-naturals exceed. Give then, philosophers, the reason, Why them thus Death delays to seize on. Death spares the doctor, grave and prim, For his great usefulness to him. For one he thus in kindness leaves, A thousand yearly he receives. But when Disease, though oft he mock'd her, Him useless makes, death cures the doctor. Alternate thus, the fee once sure, Death and the doctor kill and cure. Hail! living monitors and sage, To a vain, frolic, vitious age! With taking manner to behave, You to yourselves assume the Grave— Hail worthies of the Coan tribe! What pen your triumphs can describe, Your triumphs vast, when illness seizes, O'er purses, patients, and—diseases! Nor angry at a brother be, Heav'n mortal foes design'd these three; Who mutual work each other's fall, You wisely then destroy them all; For thus, howe'er the squabble rose, They cease for ever to be foes. To DANIEL N?, Esq Tell me, just from the doctor's hands, Secure from his and death's demands; Say, Daniel from the lion's den, Can doctors e'er be honest men, Who, praying for their daily bread, Wish men diseas'd, though better dead? Yes, doctors honest you may call, For doctors seldom pray at all. ????? ???????. How proud this rule adorns each shelf, To hearts unknown, man, “know thyself;” For thus, self knowledge and self-love Not friends, but foes, commutual prove! Who then this precept can practise? To know one's self, is to despise. On a Foreigner's losing a considerable Sum of Money at a Gaming-table with a Sharper. Hail, fam'd Britannia! hospitable land! Justly by Nature destin'd to command, Not merely kingdoms (these are trivial parts Of thy immense domain) but human hearts: Thy son my boundless thanks shall ever win, I was a stranger, and he took me in. C?'S CURE. Written in the year 1764. See C? crawl the viper of the times, And dart his poison through ten thousand rhymes; Foaming with more than canine fury swell, And grin in numbers like a fiend from hell. The more enlighten'd and improv'd the age, The more our envy-tortur'd bard will rage. But let the blackest guilt our times deform, Then will the mighty C? cease to storm; With real vices be our isles o'ergrown, Then will his spleen abate, and then alone. But, may he rather with black venom burst, Than thus disgrac'd our nation and accurst; In vortices of rhyming madness tost, Rather than silent at Britannia's cost. On MARRIAGE. Felices ter, et amplius Quos irrupta tenet copula ? Hor. Marriage is good, mankind agree; One flesh let male and female be. One in the grand resolve of life, Eternal hate, and mutual strife. One form'd exactly for another, To harass and torment each other. But better thus their spleen to vent, And gross abuse, till all is spent, Than, haply, disengag'd from home, The public pests abroad to roam. On the Same. [The man whom Wedlock renders sib] The man whom Wedlock renders sib To woman, thus regains his rib, Which erewhile from his side was stole, To envelope the female soul: But O! what thousands, luckless born, Will for a rib receive a thorn! On an Author who pleaded Poverty as an excuse for Printing. Crito is miserably poor—what then? So often are the worthiest of men. But what his want of fortune ne'er could do, He prints to prove his want of genius too. As if (on man's unfeeling heart severe) One single evil could not claim his tear. That want is piteous, but admits a cure, This still unremedied he must endure. Alas! alas! if the trite maxim's right, Two blacks can never, never make a white. For once, two negatives forget their use, Nor can one kind affirmative produce. Add nought to nought (what so prolific breeds?) And the whole sum of—nothing straight succeeds. To A CLERGYMAN Too fond of appearing in Print. Write on, your trade is, all agree, Argumentorum vi probare, Eve ate of the forbidden tree, Et quod humanum est errare. Practice and Theory ne'er should part. Example teaches mankind more, Fixes the judgment, gains the heart, Than Precept, hackney'd o'er and o'er. The End of the First Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II. Phœbe, fave, novus ingreditur tua templa sacerdos. Tibull. SATIRES. Nil prodest quod non lædere possit idem. INTRODUCTION TO THE SATIRES. Addressed to Lord ? Look with discerning eye around, What else but vanity is found, From the imperial palace, down To the mean cottage of the clown? Mankind pursue, with endless strife, Lur'd by false estimates of life, Those objects which, when they o'ertake, Them more supremely wretched make. And why? let all for once attend, Without the means, we seek the end. Seek Happiness, but her in vain, Unknown to Virtue, would attain. She's paradise, divinely stor'd; Virtue's, to guard, the flaming sword; A flaming sword to all who would, Without her suff'rance, bold intrude. But who her sacred steps pursue, Them she conducts, and welcomes too. But this fine scene for moral wit Will bards of graver studies fit. Subjects less solemn far we chuse, That suit the laughter-loving Muse, Suit aptly the satiric pen, The whims and caprices of men. These gain'd immortal praise to Young, In his keen pointed numbers sung. Who would the rash attempt avow, To pluck the laurels from his brow, Those subjects, impotent, explore, Which he exhausted long before? No; let the passion, love of fame, Be universal as his name; While we, self-borne the daring Muse, No borrow'd wings would meanly use. What follies yet remain unsung, From vanity and dulness sprung, Though oft Pope's justly-kindled rage Made such the laughter of the age? A few now would the muse select, In all their native trappings deckt, As through life's wayward paths men plod, Or skip, extravagantly odd. No characters unknown we draw, Which mankind living never saw. Not Nature just in ev'ry part, But transcripts of the writer's heart. Vagaries of a troubled brain, Ineffably absurd and vain. Wild thoughts, made wilder by his pen, Stuff'd into characters of men. As Rome's great satirist describes A monster form'd from various tribes, With which his reader's eye he feasts, Women and fishes, fowls and beasts. Thus C?'s frantic pencil draws, Exalts with blame, damns with applause. Nor strange, himself so little man, So little human in his plan. In branding him we break no laws, But thus assert the public cause. The public he abuses, who First fed him, and preserves him so. With thankless and ungrateful pen, Styles his supporters worst of men. As the fell snake that bosom stings Which it to life and motion brings This, and whatever else occurs relating to a late celebrated bard, was finished a considerable time before his decease: a piece of information the reader may think necessary, to break the force of an obvious remark.. Censure on him we justly call A panegyric pass'd on all. Satire should ever build on truth, Absurd, else, senseless, and uncouth. Without truth we to gain eclat, Ourselves, but not mankind, may draw. Without truth satirists are sure Deeply to wound, but never cure. Far other features we would sketch, Than men from mere idea fetch. On those alone our numbers flow, Which from examples well we know, Living examples, ev'ry where That boldly in our faces stare. Authors, among this motly race, Possess no undistinguish'd place; Authors, howe'er bred up in schools, Still of mankind the greatest fools. Blockheads will ever swarm below, But why should print proclaim them so? Reptiles beneath the ground should crawl, Else trodden under foot by all. But with disguise's artful veil, That we may persons still conceal, No one whole character we chuse, Though form'd by Nature, not the Muse. To pick out objects wrong or right, To show our malice and our spite, This not, on Satire's lib'ral plan, Were, Flaccus-like, to laugh at man, But, for the rag on dunghills roll'd, Like dainty cinder-wives to scold. We, in offending justly checkt, From various characters select, That, blended artfully, we may Heighten'd the ridicule survey. Men, things offensive to the eye With much disgust, though single, spy; But, if in heaps collected, who Would not the strongest loathing show? These, into parts resolv'd again, To various owners appertain. Thus artists show the curious work, Where springs aud wheels complexly lurk, Though, as one master's labour shown, Each claims a workman of its own. Mankind here, as if call'd by name, May each his darling foible claim; Just as the cap befits him, wear, Nor owning, call the Muse severe. Nor we less cautious shall describe That mongrel breed, the author-tribe; Though small compassion often shown, No individuals shall be known: For such, though they impos'd our task, Humanity implores the mask. A task, that ever would begin, Were we to take all rhymers in. Rhymers, who, for a verse or two, Think immortality their due. Vain thought! that words dispos'd to chime, Should therefore hit the true sublime. A pigmy, perch'd upon Parnassus, Still justly for a pigmy passes. A dunce in numbers, never rose Above a very dunce in prose. When will that blissful æra come, When Dulness shall be ever dumb, When desks shall authors' works confine, Immortal there content to shine, Not for a moment dragg'd to light, Then plung'd in everlasting night? Soon Reputation dies; yet man Would shorten still its narrow span; Before the spade performs its task, Or worms their fated banquet ask, To Fame's bar'd heart the quill apply, And straight poetically die. Foul suicide, without dismay Calm perpetrated ev'ry day! Gibbets may rot, and axes rust, If each self-judg'd bravado must, In bold defiance of all law, Upon himself in secret draw. But while, my Lord, the satire hits Those little rhyme-engender'd wits, Applied by Candour's voice to you, It forms but your elogium due; As objects, when the sun-beam's near, Some dark, some luminous, appear; Or as fam'd lanterns, aptly made, Light here diffuse, and there a shade. To dumb Oblivion's long long night To consecrate such bards how right! For thus, with glory and renown Unfading we true genius crown. POETICAL CHARACTERISTICS; OR, An ESTIMATE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF RHYMING. IN THREE CANTOS. Navem agere ignarus navis timet: abrotonum ægro Non audet, nisi qui didicit, dare: quod melicorum est Promittunt melici: tractant fabrilia fabri: Scribimus indocti doctique poëmata passim. Hic error tamen et levis hæc insania quantas Virtutes habeat, sic collige: vatis avarus Non temerè est animus; versus amat, hoc studet unum; Detrimenta, fugas servorum, incendia ridet; Non fraudem socio, puerove incogitat ullam Pupillo; vivit siliquis et pane secundo: Militiæ quanquam piger ac malus, utilis urbi. Hor. CANTO I. While others make strange fuss about Statesmen with places, or without Written in the year 1763., Damn men and measures, good or bad, And run politically mad; While Past'ral Life is taught to rage With all the rancour of the age, And C? meets his match indeed On his own southern side of Tweed, (His own blows on himself recoil'd), By Genius and by Valour foil'd Alluding to a very elegant little piece under the title of Genius and Valour, written in opposition to the famous Prophecy of Famine.: Far other subjects offer now, To fillet round the poet's brow; The laugh, the banter, or the sneer, Are the severest things sound here. Say, Muse, ah! whither art thou fled, Scarce known save for the mighty dead, The mighty dead (ye proud, forgive) That more emphatically live, Than whom a mere mechanic breath Grossly distinguishes from death? Say, gentle native of the skies, With inspiration-beaming eyes; With step thy pensive frame that tells, And brow on which complacence dwells; In what devout retirement now, Parent of thought sublime, art thou? To what sequester'd island hied, Lash'd by some ocean's ambient tide, Where Nature wears her gentlest form, Unconscious of the surly storm; Where Seasons but of milder sort On airy roseate pinions sport, Presenting to the ravish'd sight Each chosen object of delight: Where, through the groves and lilied plains, Simplicity primæval reigns, Blythe-ey'd Contentment at her side, And Plenty, like a blooming bride; Love, with her temples wreath'd with flow'rs, Sighing in amaranthine bow'rs; Music, with rapture in her look, Breathing soft airs beside the brook; And Contemplation, slowly stept, In dark-brown shades her dwelling kept. Where, blended in sweet social cares, Which each with equal transport shares, Some happy race, by Heav'n design'd The full perfection of their kind, On Nature's gifts spontaneous live, They grateful, as she free to give. There, with thy light aëreal train, That trip with nimble foot the plain; Explore contemplative the grove, Or loiter in the green alcove; In Inspiration's magic cell, With Silence handmaid meet to dwell. There, till Britannia learns the art No more from Nature to depart, Much shock'd with Vice, and tir'd of Folly, With meek-ey'd, calm-brow'd Melancholy, On beds of myrrh, edg'd round with flow'rs, To pass the pleasure-gliding hours. How many at thine altars bend, And much phantastic zeal pretend, Thou to indulge their fond desire, To touch their torpid lips with fire; Then, though unheard they bend the knee, Dare inspiration boast from thee? Though thy kind dwelling, now and then, Among the gentler sons of men, (Shenstones, whose laurel never dies) Thy native mansion is the skies. Angels behold thee, and admire, Caught from thy living glance their fire. Tun'd to the majesty of praise, While millions their loud voices raise, Trembling beneath thy magic hands The sapphire harp angelic stands. Martyrs, and saints, and cherubs throng, To hear the rapture-warbled song; Jehovah (all his might proclaim, August, unnutterable name!) From his high throne eternal bends, And to the hymn sublime attends; Heav'n's battlements re-echo round, And distant worlds return the sound. Shall mortals then to thee look up, Just reeling from the midnight-cup, Just from the brothel's haunts impure, Thy aid, O goddess! to procure? Thy laurels flourish not, but where They breathe a pure untainted air; Suck the best juices of the soil, That fertile bears with little toil. Wave, Satire, then thy fiercest pen, To chastise those licentious men; Send them degraded—to the plough, The circlet twisted from their brow. Because some striplings write and read, A most important brag indeed; So bearded over is their chin, That barbers weekly are call'd in; Because to manhood's size grown up, To revel o'er the midnight-cup; Shuffle the cards with much address, And study—at a game of chess; Look virgins boldly in the face, And fearlessly appoint the place: Because a little dust they raise At balls, assemblies, routs, and plays; Fir'd by some fair-one's sparkling eyes, Say something wit-like by surprise; Their doughty consequence to show, For trifles can outrageous grow; Sneer at the consecrated Book, And swear with unconfounded look: Because our classic sons of same They intimately know—by name, And haply can, with cadence neat, A line from Pope or Gay repeat: Such scholars, gentlemen, and wits, (And doubtless such it well befits) Their vanity straight takes the hint, They write, and must appear in print. Say, what the subjects most they chuse? Subjects well worthy of the Muse, Themselves, their noble selves, that seem First in their own sublime esteem. To give invention play uncheck'd, Thus they the poorest themes select. To point out Nature's every flaw, Their own sad flimsy portraits draw, From whence alone mankind may see, Eve ate of the forbidden tree. The freedom of the press we rate As the Palladium of the state; That test so much renown'd in story, That bulwark of Britannia's glory. But often too its value's paid, What blockheads hence are daily made; What rhyming coxcombs, that requir'd Ere silenc'd ev'n a Pope inspir'd; Pope, who of dunces stoop'd to sing, Though borne sublime on Homer's wing. Thus nought of human good we know Unmingled with its share of wo. No blessing but its curse attends, Mutual to thwart each other's ends. Alas! Britannia's fairest fame Is oft converted to her shame! Her very strength and pow'r betray Her wants and weakness every day! What should her throne eternal make, May it with dire convulsions shake! But Heav'n, here let our murmurs rest, Will order all things for the best; On Wisdom make success attend, And folly in misfortune end. To shine a poet, you must be A critic of no mean degree. Sense, judgment, learning, knowledge, skill Should ever wield the mighty quill. The Muse and Contemplation dwell In the same foliage-mantled cell; Ever attach'd to one another, Who wooes the one must woo the other. The poet's pencil to employ, Each should a quick nice taste enjoy; Deep to discern, not take on trust, The beautiful, sublime, and just; With sudden sapient glance, disjoin The spurious from the current coin; With Kames's eye Lyncean view, And pierce all Nature through and through. Poets should, whether wrong or right, See things in an uncommon light; At will, change attitudes, sites, places, And vary ornaments and graces; With magic pow'rs (confin'd to them) Turn the dim pebble to a gem; In barren tracts bid roses bloom, And rush-grown marshes breathe perfume; Bid fairy scenes in deserts rise, And endless Edens charm the eyes. To be a poet, we require The touch electrical of fire, To vibrate on each tingling sense, Enthusiastic, quick, intense; A certain pleasing phrenzy known To seraphs and the Muse alone. To form the poet, Fancy ought To swell and elevate the thought; Waft us, on her excursive wings, Above the vulgar range of things. Who at the Muse's altar kneel, Should ever exquisitely feel; Through all Sensation's thrillings know The keen extremes of bliss and wo. The bard, in fine, should ever claim A title to immortal fame, The utile and dulce hit, As scholar, gentleman, and wit. How few, alas! in modern days, On these erect their deathless praise, A basis nothing e'er can shake, Though cities fall, and mountains quake; Though proud Ambition's trophies sink, And tumble down Fate's dreadful brink; Though all the labours of mankind, And states themselves, a period find! Thus Homer shot his noon-tide ray, The sun that rul'd the Grecian day. Thus, with the moon's auspicious light, Virgil rose all serenely bright. Thus Milton shines, beheld from far, Britannia's first poetic star. How few take Nature for their guide, Seduc'd by wantonness and pride! Boast, yet pathetic all the while, The simple elegance of style! That flow of unaffected thought, Which charms at once, and comes unsought! To squeeze out lifeless, cold, cold strains, Through thick, thick skulls, from hard-bound brains; To rack each faculty and pow'r, For one stale couplet—in an hour; (Poor verses that, like man and wife, Together live in endless strife) To clap most cruelly in fetters A set of harmless simple letters, That had, ah not disgrac'd by those, Rang'd the extensive fields of prose; To torture lines, much better single, That their extremities may jingle; Like sharp, shrill reed-pipes from the marsh, To squeak most musically harsh: Thus to make sounds, with bold pretence, Pass with the gaping croud for sense, As, deck'd in plumes of gaudy hue, The jackdaw would be peacock too; These patch up (well Reviewers know it) In hodiernal phrase, a poet. Thus too, with sacrilegious hands, Boldly transgressing the commands, To be in estimation had, They rob the treasures of the dead. But sure, of pilferers accurst, The literary thief's the worst. Not from mankind alone he steals, And meanly the base act conceals; His theft to Heav'n itself extends, For Genius from the skies descends. The servile plagiary is then The robber both of gods and men. Such rhyming mendicants for fame, Purloiners of another's name; Such dwarfs, some men of stature greet, That hobble on poetic feet; Such glow-worms, in dark corners met, That twinkle—when the sun is set; Harpies, where-e'er the laurel hangs, Hov'ring around with outstretch'd fangs; Such reptiles, each hoots as he passes, Creeping up belly-wise Parnassus; Such wretched tackers to of verse, Sacred to man's—celanda pars; Such poets of mechanic race, Like locusts swarm in ev'ry place; Beneath no fear, restraint, or awe, In spite of common sense and law, In spight of Nature, Taste, and Kames, Damn to eternity their names. Such fancy Poetry a trade, Like shoes on lasts their verses made; And, like the coarse ill-fitted shoe, Indeed most stiff and awkward too. A trade it is; but to practise, You must serve 'prentice in the skies. Else, though together words you link, Like ill-match'd parish-bells to clink; (The woful dirge that dreary tolls Oblivion to such tuneful souls) Though, now and then, a phrase compound Lifts up the unmajestic sound; Though scraps of wit, and shreds of sense, The reader meets—and knows from whence; Though Fancy glimmers, here and there, Like meteors through the troubled air; Though, half in rubbish hid, a gem Twinkles—with lustre not from them; Though, sometimes in a feeble spring, Imagination spreads her wing; Though haply, gazing many an hour, Up starts a solitary flow'r, Reflecting beauty on the whole, From Pope or Dryden's garden stole; Though these as miracles surprise, And for a moment charm the wise; Like old cloaths patch'd with purple glare, And make the idiot rabble stare; Yet absent Genius, to inspire With her bright, equal, vital fire, To wing the Fancy, warm the heart, And all her magic to impart; Such as in Gray's chaste finish'd lines, Or Ogilvie's rich numbers shines; Such manufacturers of verse May strut, their betters to asperse; Such may their maim'd and halting rhyme, By counting their ten fingers, time; The Age's standard models be, For expletive sublimity; With pretty tinkling, jingling numbers, Charm the transported soul to—slumbers; Quite inoffensive cordial strains, To wakeful wit-molested brains: But sure they ne'er can poets be, Till mankind cease to hear and see; Till Young poetically dead, And Akenside no longer read. Vainly we summon pen and ink, To write, when we neglect to think. Against the Muse we act high treason, Nor rhyme our madrigals, nor reason. Mankind this maxim should behold Struck out in capitals of gold, Adopted by Rome's first-rate wit, Poeta nascitur, non fit. In phrase vernacular to show it, A poet must be born a poet. Because this precept oft forgot, (Alas! what standard rule is not?) One might, by trade, on turtles dine, But chuses starving with the Nine. Another now of court-suit brags, Now, struck with rhyme-fits, creeps in rags. Some lay aside the manly tool, Made tradesmen by poetic rule. Some leave the plough, to lose their time, And oft their senses too, in rhyme. Others, in sacerdotal gown, Affect poetical renown; They prov'd their knowledge in the text, And thus become mere blockheads next. Others, beneath the three-tail'd wig Full-spread, look most profoundly big; Rostrums had eterniz'd their name, Not by the Muse condemn'd to fame. Others, because mankind they save From fell diseases and the grave, Think some great freedom they may use, And murder with their quill the Muse. Such, set on Pegasus's back, In modern days a very hack, As them not Lyttelton can stop, Soon in oblivion's pit must drop. The end of the First Canto. CANTO II. Yes; men of fortune, let them rhyme, Their greatest foe, to murder time. Time a dead burden on them hangs, Which they sustain with endless pangs; And much the Muses oft avail To lighten it when all things fail. Satan might else boast some excuse, His wiles and fiery darts to use. That state from manly cares exempt, Is his apology to tempt; Near too his idleness akin, And in demerit next, to sin. The hapless wretch with riches curst, Is of all menial slaves the worst, If no ingenious liberal turn Makes his expanded bosom burn; If Science, bounteous but to few, Opes not her treasures to his view; Who cannot, disengag'd from pelf, Retire well-pleas'd within himself. To know, is but to pity him, A slave to caprice and to whim. A slave to indolence and sloth, That eat him up, as cloaths the moth. A slave to passion and to pride, That whirl him down their rapid tide. A slave to discontent and spleen, With many a rash resolve between. A slave to every modish folly, To sullen moppish melancholy. A most obsequious slave to Vice, And her attendants, cards and dice, Whose prize, still fools, or knaves dispute, The bottle and the prostitute. Let him then rhyme, and who can tell, But you may save a soul from hell? That there are some exceptions we With you most cordially agree; As, when the Winter sets in drear, Haply some ever-greens appear: Haply, in base and sordid mines, Some vein of nobler metal shines. Besides, these slaves of high degree In many articles are free. Freedom they nobly boast from both, As tradesmen feel, their word, and oath; But honour here, to souls refin'd, Argues a low plebeian mind; Though in mere trifles did you doubt them, Zounds! 's death—they carry swords about them. A slave in all things else, to be Is just in some such instance free. But to destroy that monster, Time, As they claim privilege to rhyme; Not freedom here alone they use, They take much greater with the Muse. So much averse to be confin'd, No rule whate'er has force to bind. For who would be a dupe to schools, To men, who almost breathe by rules? Horace of poetry may prate, Mere Popes alone his maxims rate. Poetic licence too apart, Beyond ev'n credible they start. Thus, faulty in some thing or other, From one extreme we seek another. The Stagyrite and Flaccus wrote, And hence such numbers daily quote, Because their scanty talents rose No higher than such rules as those. Their wit and precepts ne'er dispart, That cramp'd by Nature, these by Art. But would our new-light bards invent, On forms less scrupulously bent, Maxims that might their genius suit, Boileau might doubtless then be mute. For better, to the lib'ral man, The ample than the bounded plan. The Gallic critic writes, confin'd By Nature, to the humankind; Beyond her bourn our poets soar, Traverse whole worlds, and ask for more. Space, matter, time, obey the nod Of each upstart poetic god. His mouth each couplet-joiner opes, And out fly strange unusual tropes, Such figures, metaphors, and phrases, As Nature he affronts who praises; Such imagery, which right to relish, Though meant to heighten and embellish, You must, whate'er enjoyment hence is, Don-Quixote-like, give up your senses; Or with heroic nonsense burn, See giants where but windmills turn. But such employments aptly hit Our great originals in wit, Who much affected glee pretend, That them we ne'er can comprehend. “The critics ah! how grossly stupid! “How crawls on earth the vile quadruped, “While the strong eagle soars sublime, “True bards but eagles wing'd by rhyme! “How long will writers bless our land, “Yet not one reader understand! “Thy gifts, Heav'n, less to us dispense, “Till men boast more than common sense. “Beyond this vulgar test when learn'd, “Then will our merit be discern'd. “Ah! why were printing-presses plann'd, “But mankind's ignorance to brand! “To nothing doom them, Heav'n, once more, “Till our scann'd works read o'er and o'er.” Thus pray our bards, and adepts say, That they successfully still pray; We mean such adepts, as could see Reviewers damn'd, and Dulness free. But shall the critics them pass o'er, Umpires decreed of human lore? No; first let fishes seek the land, And rivers in their courses stand. Let needles first their poles reverse, Nor morning-beams night's shades disperse. The critic's truest, noblest fame, Is to admonish and reclaim; If they in vain this task discharge, Then excommunicate at large, Not from the kirk, but, with disdain, From Immortality's bless'd fane. That common origin whence springs The fix'd propriety of things; That particle of light divine, By which we Reason would define; Those ties, in essence and in name, Which sentiment and language claim, Objects of sense with thought combin'd, And matter somehow link'd to mind: In these the probable and just, That have subsisted still, and must; Or, in one word concentred all, What aptly makind, Nature, call; Such seems a standard too contracted For bards, by no set rules directed, Such rules as all mankind must own To be supremely—theirs alone. Nature too unembellish'd lies, To ravish hypercritic eyes. Her charms too vulgarly are seen, Without the optic lens between. No depths of study are requir'd, Nor Plato-like to be inspir'd; A heart's the requisite alone, That Beauty's touches may be known, Still faithful, as magnetic steel. Are we, when Nature bids us feel. But yet how mean to value that Which occupies the clown's chit-chat? Why those ideas entertain, That ev'n to them appear so plain? Why own sensations, that must strike Philosophers and hinds alike? This would Invention's rambles curb, And Nature's order quite disturb; To rustic life would Genius sink, To such as only—feel and think, Who, while Ambition's transport glows, Ne'er nobly venture to—compose. Hence, to our learned poets, this Display of parts is all amiss, Where simple thoughts, in simple phrase, Support alone our claim to praise. Where obvious lies to all the sense, Unkept the judgment in suspense. Where Commentators have no room, To twist, conjecture, and presume. Nature to them's wrapt in disguise, Her therefore would our bards despise; Yet a disguise not native to her, But what absurdly they bestow her. They seem somehow chagrin'd at Fate, And would the world anew create. For sure, their mysteries of strain To some strange system appertain. Their modes of thinking too refer, Else Monthly Critics greatly err, To some surprising race of men, That ne'er were taught from Dryden's pen: And, as all things from chaos rose, That our vast universe compose; So, into prompt belief to draw us, Our bards begin too with a chaos. Some nobler species (where or when Are secrets to the sons of men) May fathom all their depths, and be More critically learn'd than we. But here, would Heav'n grant my request, Would I with ignorance be blest; Yet thus (what wonders swarm below!) Like Young, like Pope, like Blacklock, know. Meantime, advantages accrue To those their footsteps that pursue. For thus their various hours ingross'd, That ah! might otherwise be lost; Such visits paid by Fancy round To fairy scenes, and magic ground; Thus stretch'd Imagination's wing Beyond immensely—ev'ry thing; Thus Memory (enrich'd by stealth) Emptied of all her precious wealth; Their passions thus by wonders caught, Whirl'd round in vortices of thought; Their elemental fire assuag'd, And restless faculties engag'd: The Muses—who so kind as they! How cheated Satan of his prey! What blessings from the great employ Does hence Society enjoy! All negatives we grant indeed, As Parthians flying oft succeed. Thus, had the Muse, with aspect bland, And bays extended in her hand, At Stella's birth presiding, said, “Be thou a metre-loving maid,” Stella had ne'er, to show her sense, Shone at all womankind's expense; Expos'd their hours quite run to waste, Their ignorance, and want of taste; Their little unaspiring aims, Content with sorry housewife-names; Within a narrow roof confin'd The mighty powers of female mind; Whose best exertions but imply A jelly, custard, or a pie; Mirrours and pictures rightly plac'd, Or side-boards garnish'd out with taste; Unknown, though with brocaded suit on, To Hume, to Hutcheson, and Newton See the piece called Stella in this volume,. But not to Stella's case confin'd The blessings of the Muses kind; Around diffusively they spread, Like currents from the fountain-head. For some choice topics more, at large Our task appointed to discharge, To hail their glorious deeds who—sing, In our next labour we shall bring; No fact designedly suppressing, To prove the Muse a public blessing. Meantime, each wit of spirit, show it, Dare to live poor and be a—poet. The end of the Second Canto. CANTO III. Would you detain men from the stews? Let them have commerce with the Muse. Their passions, that no limits know, Must ever have some stated flow; If spent at all, a trifling care, The manner how, or when, or where. As ships from rocks secur'd by cables, To keep mankind from gaming-tables, Them fasten with poetic fetters, Link'd from the alphabet of letters. But that one almost daily views Murders committed on the Muse, Many might bid adieu to life, Stabb'd ruthless by his brother's knife; Our very roofs secure no more, Our inmost chambers stain'd with gore. Yes; at the altar force the Muse, If she your modest suit refuse; Then shall our wives and daughters be From your attempts unhallow'd free. That robbers may our roads desert, And from our houses thieves depart; Let mortals all their cunning use, Freely to purloin from the Muse: To rob, on purpose to conceal, Her sons, is from herself to steal. By taking thus, unknown they give, Die faster, as they strive to live; As, aiming to be more than frog, Bursts the fam'd monarch of the bog. Though steel strength from the magnet gains, The magnet still its pow'r retains. Yon blossom still remains unsoil'd, Though haply of its honey spoil'd. But for the harmless art of rhyming, Men would be still offending Hymen. Might stand accus'd (such W?'s use is) Of some foul capital abuses. Fly in the face of law and reason, Guilty of heresy or treason; Of which in Britain's annals we So many dire examples see: As heroes on the public road, To ease poor misers of their load, To free their brethren—with a knife, From all the miseries of life; Above their fellow-mortals be Highly exalted—on a tree. Rhyme on then, mortals; for in numbers The love of mischief often slumbers; The wicked thought oft melts away, Cool-worded in a roundelay. Obid and Teriff See a piece called, The Poetical Duumvirate., harmless now, Had broken else some plighted vow; Stole from some too kind virgin more Than they again could e'er restore. Thank then the Muse, ye lordly brothers, Ye loving aunts, and tender mothers; That no fair friend meets a disaster, Thank not the man, but poetaster. Rhyme on then, mortals; and in verse Your thoughts to climes remote disperse; For, were they not abroad to roam, What mischief might they do at home! Had W? thus, whose far other lass is, But woo'd the Muse upon Parnassus, He had preserv'd his wits and sense still, Undamn'd by H?'s mighty pencil. To show what lengths the human heart May ah! from Rectitude depart, Doom'd to the scorpion lash of fame, Nor burst with consciousness and shame; God said, in vengeance to his foes, Let ? arise, and ? arose. Rhyme on then, mortals; better rhyme, Than suffer for some horrid crime. Better lines meet, and jingle too, Than muffled bells ding dang for you. Better to chain a few poor letters, Than you be clapt in iron fetters. Better the Muse and you—forgot, Than in a dungeon you should rot. Thus, had not C? spent his ire, And timely flash'd away his fire; This self-same C? might have been A robber on the highway seen; A cut-throat, muffled up in gloom, In some lone corner of a room; Escaping thus those dreadful pangs He feels who by his gullet hangs. Forgive him then, thrice noble B?; Newgate had claim'd a C? mute. Thee he revil'd, else with his fellows Satan had sent him to the gallows. Thee he mistook, but not himself, A very cunning wary elf; Self-preservation is a rule First taught us in wise Nature's school; So, from the halter to be free, He drew his pen, and libell'd thee. But censure from his pen we find Turn'd into praise by all mankind. Forgive him then, thrice noble B?; Thou but half-prais'd, had he been mute. Ryme on then, mortals; better rhyme, Although you reach not the sublime, Than at Temptation's mercy lie, The veriest wretch beneath the sky; Toss'd to and fro, howe'er you strive, As whim, caprice, or passion drive. Such ills had happen'd C?, and O! The mighty author of Rodondo, Had they not thus themselves amus'd, And all their gall in rhyme effus'd. Like ale in bottles they fermented, Fate long their bursting kind prevented; But Politics too fiery grew, Out cork and froth abruptly flew. Happy this tempest overblown, Nought but the cork itself o'erthrown! C? mounts Pegasus, and strives To prove—how fast the devil drives, Drives on, such Satan's plan to mend all, Through slander, obloquy, and scandal. Gross wit's fierce elements engage, A deep, dark Pitt confines their rage Alluding to a poem in two Cantos, entitled Rodondo, or, The State-Jugglers, written on the opposite side to Churchill, who, although corporeally dead, may be said still to survive in his works, according to the bold and expressive language of Inspiration, though applied to a far different character, he being dead, yet speaketh. This, with what is intimated in a former note, and the necessity the author was under of keeping his piece unbroken and entire, agreeable to his original plan, will, he flatters himself, sufficiently protect him from the vile opprobrium in the fable, of the ass spurning at the dead lion., What devastations else had been In womens fair inclosures seen! The Muse, in pity to mankind, Strongly inspir'd each author's mind; The simple, harmless bosom left, For theirs of gentleness bereft: And why? her choice from goodness rose, Of evils twain the least she chose; Permitted them to lash a few, Who but receiv'd, perhaps, their due, Rather than, from restraints set loose, Mankind had felt worse than abuse. Better to suffer from the pen, Than from the hands of desp'rate men. Bards rarely deal in swords or knives, To wound our properties or lives. The poet's curse, howe'er severe, Seldom sinks deeper than the ear. True; no exception here should be, Let the same censure light on—me. Thanks to the Muse, so little fame Can sport malicious with my name, That, through life's crouded path below, I almost unobserv'd can go; Though scarce for good distinguish'd, still, Not once remarkable for ill. Though not by infinite so good, As God and Reason mean I should; Yet am I not, my conscience clear, Worse than to mankind I appear. These, in the same proportion true, Comprise my shame and glory too. But, Reader, lest you should declare Against the prim Confessor's chair; No more, so your chagrin suspend, Shall the pert egotist offend. Yet, haply, men well-pleas'd may see Their own apt portraitures in me. For look with moral eye about, All's mediocrity throughout, Save, where we only it should find, When fierce disputes inflame mankind: When W? wields his fell pen O'er a strict set of harmless men, Puffs, with proud, rage-inflated cheek, And storms, to prove the spirit meek. Rhyme on then, mortals; better rhyme, Than waste in idleness your time; Or, which is worse, from Discontent, Your rage and spite on others vent. Could Zalates See the next piece but one under this title. employ his pen, That most sloth-overcome of men; Did not the chaste and virtuous Muse To him her visit kind refuse; Would he be late and early found A constant plague to all around? For had she, with auspicious pow'r, But smil'd upon his natal hour; His name for worth had been engrav'd, And, haply, all our labour sav'd. Each son of metre too may say, Himself a compliment to pay, He generously does all he can, To help a worthy class of men; Who else, in home-spun russet clad, Might handle spades for daily bread. In mines poetic all such [illeg.]ewers Cut ample work out for Reviewers. Such take the ready way to starve Themselves, their—betters to preserve. For mercy's sake, ye critics, then, Spare, spare such charitable men! O! graciously our spirits raise, And throw us out a little praise, On which our famish'd souls may live! Blessed are they that freely give! And Gratitude demands it too, You should feed us for feeding you. Good beef and pudding we afford, And wines, to decorate your board; Surely, you should return as good, Fame, that light elemental food. Thus mutual giv'n shall mutual last The eleemos'nary repast. But this sublime existence gives, Who eats with faith, immortal lives; Those grant, with much intestine strife, Only a temporary life. Doubtless, we need then no director, To tell who's most the benefactor. What complicated good the Muse Loves through Creation to diffuse! Not ills alone would she prevent, To her philanthropy's extent; But also, to each rank below, Would blessings positive bestow! Kings might their drawing-rooms decline, To pay their visits to the Nine. Commence for once (unsceptred) men, And wield in harmless glee their pen. Such only then would murder time, With monarchs sure a simple crime; Not slaughter, for a plume, or gem, Millions, nor feel one pang for them; Sprung from one common kindred clay, Not less divinely form'd than they; Though accident, mistake, or guilt, With blood of murder'd thousands spilt, (Oft for their punishment alone) Have plac'd such monsters on a throne; To rule mankind with iron rod, And personate all things but—God! The royal sons of Freedom here Angels in human form appear. George sills Britannia's throne, to show Heav'n one anointed boasts below. Rhyme on then, mortals; for by metre, Our taste of life becomes the sweeter; Though to some lowly cottage doom'd, Unvisited by satraps plum'd, Where courts the splendid ball ne'er form, Far from proud grandeur and—the storm. Each hour on downy pinion hence Brings some new rapture to the sense. Objects around we can arrange Through one eternal joyous change; Within our closets worlds explore, And act all mankind o'er and o'er; Extend life's poor contracted span, Beyond the common bounds of man; From sleep's ignoble periods take, And more than vulgarly awake. Though our apology how strong, Howe'er sleep's stupor we prolong; Since the kind Muse, till Morning beams, Inspires us with ecstatic dreams, Ecstatic dreams of—glorious things, Claret, ragouts, and fiddle-strings! “But who is this, to merit blind, “Who dares to satirize mankind? “What noble lineage can he boast? “Has he travers'd Europa's coast? “What mighty duke rang'd states about with, “To—lose what virtue they set out with? “In what school academic bred? “In what fam'd system deeply read? “Beneath what sophist taught to think, “And at Pierian font to drink? “At what Gamaliel's footstool plac'd, “To learn the principles of taste? “What fire Promethean has he stole, “Not one bard-damning, but the whole? “What critic, at the midnight-lamp, “Taught him the true sublime to stamp? “Has he, to be admir'd for art, “Some rhyming-grammar got by heart? “Has S?, in transports flung, “Inform'd him how—to use his tongue? “Has B?, mechanically fir'd, “His thoughts possess'd, and brain inspir'd? “Or W?, whose employ to parse is, “Told him the secret to make verses? “Say, what romantic child of fun “With cobwebs would obscure the sun?” Thou waspish elf, with spleen o'er-run! Thou Dennis's poetic son! Wouldst thou, vile pedant, make me vain? Curse, arm'd with spectacles, my strain. An arrow through my liver send? Snatch quick thy standish, and commend. That me effectually would raise To Johnson's excellence of praise; This would to ?'s bards link me, Or lower than a Codrus sink me. If good the verse, no matter though The author were thyself below. If bad, no character or station Can rescue it from swift damnation. Look round mankind, thou dolt, and see, What fate waits bards of high degree, If Genius ne'er effulg'd a ray Around their laurel'd heads to play. In what inglorious spot recluse Now slumbers Dorset's once-fam'd muse? Gone, Indies could not either save, To moulder with him in the grave. But Pope shall in his strains survive, While taste or sense preserv'd alive; Shall be—till wit allied to station, The pride and glory of our nation. Right facile were the task to show it, How falsely Rochester dubb'd poet! Hence, though escutcheons grac'd his name. Expir'd soon his poetic fame; Save that some still revere his muse In that pure font of taste, the—stews. But of Plebeian race behold, Seldom oppress'd with too much gold, Dryden, the standard of the age, While mankind dotes on Virgil's page. Though poor in pelf, by wretches sought, How rich in sentiment and thought! What veins of genius glorious shine Through ev'ry massy sterling line! What rays of wit flash all about! What flow'rs of fancy bloom throughout! These shall perpetuate his name, The true-born son of classic fame, When Wilmot's is remember'd not, And Buckingham's himself forgot. Nor strange thus various the requital To men without and with a title. Each son of Genius, nobly born, Titles conferr'd surveys with scorn; In Fame's bright lists his name inroll'd, With all the pomp of letter'd gold, Would he affect to mould a lord, In some poor lumber-swept record? Refrain, thou pseudo-critic, then, To seek an author's rank with men. If not in Fame's own temple plac'd, Vainly his pedigree is trac'd, Mean, with a coronet though crown'd, Not with the Muse's laurel bound. If dull and spiritless his strains, Though blood of princes swell his veins, Despis'd like Moevius shall he be, Nor two full moons revolving see. If but a spark his verse inspires, Drawn living from celestial fires, Though meanest styl'd of Adam's sons, To whom obscure his lineage runs; Yet shall the wonders of his rhyme Triumph o'er dulness, spleen, and time; Renew'd remembrance be his lot, When ages have seen thee forgot. Rhyme on then, mortals; for in measure The miser may forget his treasure, Forget his gilded scraps of pelf, For once to recollect himself. For what with rust time intersperses, (Bless'd avarice!) to hoard up verses. Thus doubly gen'rous, doubly kind, Surpris'd would we the miser find; Happy his riches to diffuse, But parsimonious with his muse. Better our passions thus transferr'd, By whose excess men still have err'd, Than, out of place alike, and time, To swell into some actual crime. Rhyme on then, mortals; for the Muse Can much of sweet content infuse, Though no phantastic gaudy plume, Nods in the park, or drawing-room; The brow from anxious cares unbind, And throw a languor o'er the mind, Akin, while fiercer raptures cloy, To the mild equal touch of joy. While, hurried on to worse from bad, The giddy world around runs mad; From wave to wave of folly tost, Their helm and anchor, Reason, lost; Sink down, abandon'd by relief, O'erwhelm'd in the profound of grief; On Sense's shallows headlong run, By Passion's furious blast undone; Or on the rocks of Anguish dash, Which black Despair's swoln surges lash: The Muse's sons, with placid gale, Safely o'er life's rough ocean fail. Ye mortals, then, through life that plod, Whether you eat, or drink, or—nod, To love or wine devote your time, Keep the commandments all, and—rhyme. Yet some slight inconvenience flows From dealing in poetic—prose. Some errours in our mode of thinking, As well alas! as in our clinking. For say, Mytholius, why so stupid, Thus still to dote on Pan or Cupid? To Phoebus still your suit direct, When you are certain of neglect? With knee inflected bow to Ceres, Whose, than to hear, far other care is, That care expressively we call The care of millions—none at all? You cannot guess how great my pain is, Thus ever paying court to Venus; A goddess found, nor here, nor there, Unless, perhaps, found ev'ry where. She dropt her girdle, which, you know, Fell to each British fair below. These gods and goddesses long since, As Young and Akenside evince, Have, like fall'n stars, no more to rise, Resign'd the sceptre of the skies: Beings that now despotic reign But o'er the empire of your brain. Perhaps, you your request prefer, And trust me, here you cannot err, As devotees have often ranted, On purpose it should not be granted. Nor could you sure, in this respect, More proper godships e'er select. But not Mytholius to be hard on, Such indecorums we shall pardon; For, without Cupid, Pan, and Phoebus, What bard were not a downright hebes? Them from the Pantheon fond they single, Among their measur'd lines to jingle, Lest the belief might be imply'd, They ever pray'd to aught beside. Fit punishment it seems moreo'er On these divinities of yore, Aiding poor brainless couplet-moulders, To be dragg'd in by head and shoulders; Dragg'd in, lest simple blame incurr'd, To make a dull, dull line absurd; In Heav'n for their long usurpation, To suffer thus deserv'd damnation. But other instances remain, And claim admittance in our strain, To prove, what ev'ry tyro knows, From rhyming inconvenience flows. One shall suffice now from a number, Lest we our crouded page encumber. And let that one our song conclude, As the tir'd critic says it should. And whom should bards affect to please, But critics, fond of punch and ease? Critics and bards, like man and wife, Should carefully avoid all strife. Some poets, anxious to be witty, Only aspire to claim our pity; For pity sure that man deserves, Who from good manners grossly swerves. And why? a genius to commence, He gives up modesty and sense. His verse requires (how just the scoff!) Obscenity to set it off. To please, howe'er he might intend, His reader's ear, he must offend. Such would erect a spotless name On mankind's nakedness and shame; On bogs, with impure rubbish fill'd, A palace or a temple build. Ingrafted on the bramble low, Expect to find the nect'rine grow. That hackney'd Muse is surely jaded, Nor more by inspiration aided, Who, to patch up a tatter'd fame, And save from death a sinking name, For succour flies to those poor arts At which offended Virtue starts; At which, with sweet becoming grace, Fair Modesty must veil her face. Genius far other helps requires, Glowing from her own innate fires; Still sailing, on no shallows caught, Her own deep ocean vast of thought. Oaks, but no support shrubs bestow, Diffusive spread, majestic grow. No borrow'd wing the eagle needs, Self-pois'd to heav'n itself he speeds. The taste of Britons each mistook, Whoe'er penn'd an indecent book, Or, like a mean infected elf, Thought ev'ry Briton like himself. Wretch! with foul pencil to abuse The chastely-sentimental muse! To pass, with judges too in them, His paltry pebble for a gem! Yet, as the bee with occult pow'rs Sips sweets from amarescent flow'rs; So in such writers, now and then, Some rays of wit astonish men; Astonish men, who seldom view Dunghills, to meet with diamonds too. Forgive him, Virtue, spotless dame! Such write mistakenly for fame; For fame's dispens'd by thee alone, Or to the cottage or the throne; That fame, which never can decay, Though brazen statues melt away; Though earth, while all her offspring dies, Convuls'd from her shook centre flies; And yonder orbs, that shine so bright, Are whelm'd in everlasting night. Shall mortals then, O Virtue, claim Unknown to thee, thy dowery fame? Thus some usurper might drag down His prince enthron'd, and seize his crown. To love, and to resemble thee, Is only to immortal be. Forgive them; their indecent pen But recommends thee more to men; As soot, while it offends the sight, Sets off the snow's unsullied white; Or as the diamond's brighter made 'Mid the brown darkness of the shade. The end of the Third and last Canto. THE MONOPOLIST. ? omnes Vicini oderunt, noti, pueri, atque puellæ: Miraris, quum tu argento post omnia ponas, Si nemo præstet quem non merearis amorem. Hor. Sapo, condemn'd to love of gain, Tortures for it his little brain; Just knowing, all his pow'rs implied, His right hand from his left beside. His daily unremitted care, Nor fame nor glory is to share; But all just boundaries to pass, Break the twelfth precept, and amass: No matter how, or where, or when, If but in lucky hour he can. His God, his conscience, and his neighbour, Are all involv'd in this one labour. His meat, his drink, his sleep, his all, You fitly may his money call. He thinks each Christian duty paid, If he can but enlarge his trade; His trade, by all mean shifts combin'd, To pinch, distress, and cheat mankind. He thinks nought sinful that's conceal'd, No crime forbidden till reveal'd; Forgets himself a man, that he May, fiend-like, from restraints be free: A plan of action that defies, At one bold stroke, both earth and skies; A plan, far from his darling sum, To damn him in the world to come. When seasons frown upon mankind, Against us heav'n and earth combin'd; When Plenty shuts her bounteous hand, And Want, dire Want, invades our land; He steps abroad, with visage drear, To add fresh horrours to the year; Amid Despair's surrounding gloom, To aggravate the general doom; Assist the vengeance of the skies, Nor fall himself a sacrifice. No; God spares Sapo, to fulfil On base rebellious man his will; This done, himself unwept shall fall, The vilest and the worst of all. No mercy's thus to Sapo shown, Daily his guilt still deeper grown: And as his sins rise in degree, His final punishment shall be. What! gentle to a wretch whose views So much insult the heav'n-born Muse! Insult Humanity's great law, Without which vainly breath we draw! Insult Distress's tear-swoln eye! Insult Misfortune's bursting sigh! A wretch who, with insidious grin, An emblem of the fiend within, Can basely hatch a thousand lies, If his demands may thereby rise; Feign scarcity, when through the plains, In smiles array'd, Abundance reigns: A wretch, if aught but coward vile, Trembling if you but cease to smile, Who had purloin'd his neighbour's coat, For pelf, or cut his brother's throat! A wretch, who would exult to find Heav'n no more gracious to mankind! Snatch from Omnipotence the rod, And act a tyrant, for a God! His Bible's first commands despise, And, back'd by hell, monopolize! Mercy were here to worth unkind; Compassion, littleness of mind. When snakes untwist their deadly folds, Who strangely pities that beholds? When wolves for slaughter lie in wait, Who careless would brood o'er his fate; Nor snatch the instrument of death, And claim the ruffian's forfeit breath? Rise, Satire, and to gain renown, Assume the Juvenalian frown; Rise, in majestic terrour rise, Darting swift vengeance from thy eyes; Let torrents dashing down the rock, Less than thy furious numbers shock: Be no soft soothing strains thy choice, But the sonorous thunder's voice. Quick let the serpent's venom dart, To reach the inly-quiv'ring heart; Along each nerve-string let it glow, And to life's last recesses flow! Better one his deserts should share, Than thousands sink in deep despair; Reduc'd to Hunger's latest throb, And almost justified to rob. If those we loudly censure, plac'd On thrones, by tyrants oft disgrac'd; Who slaughter with unfeeling hand, And spread destruction through the land; Allur'd by Glory's specious call, And surnam'd heroes if they fall: How should we execrate the wretch, Or how his horrid portrait sketch, Who pleas'd can in cool blood observe His fellow-men unpitied—starve! Sport with their hardships; at each shock Of dire distress, inhuman mock! Riot on their heart-rending woes, His gold (curs'd gold!) increas'd with those! No gilded mite he calls his own, But cost some guiltless heart a groan: From Grief's half-dried-up sluices brought A tear, with many a pang of thought. That groan, howe'er enlarg'd his purse, Shall prove his everlasting curse; That tear, just gushing from the eyes, Against his crimes in judgment rise. What covert then shall screen his head From heav'n's vindictive sentence dread? Vainly around imploring aid, What tongue of angels intercede? What arm, omnipotently great, Snatch him suspended o'er his fate? Ten thousand curses must conspire, To heat eternally his fire; To twitch him in life's quickest part, And wreathe like adders round his heart. Behold! in yonder straw-thatch'd hut, The door as in despair fast shut, Around a hearth, where fire once burn'd, With fix'd eyes on each other turn'd; Almost by Mercy's self forsook, Anguish deep stamp'd on every look; Two wretched parents, ah! behold, Pallid with want, and pinch'd with cold! Wretched—not for themselves—alas! Far deeper rankles their distress:— Around, while husks would each revive, Their offspring croud, scarce half alive. One on the ground all ragged lies, And staggers, if in act to rise! Another gaunt, with piercing eye, Would, famish'd, seize some guardless fly! A third in fix'd attention dumb, Rakes the parch'd ashes for a crumb! Others, scarce, ah! with thought endu'd, Mangle their very nails for food! The melting father's forc'd to see His darling sink upon his knee! That round the mother's neck's decreed To die in agony of need! Deep, grave-like silence reigns about, All's hopeless solitude throughout; Save where, on broken rafter set, Each little prattler's wonted pet, Waiting his scanty pittance long, The robin chaunts his doleful song. What heart, that e'er compunction felt, Would not o'er such distresses melt? What but a monster's cas'd in steel, And form'd incapable to feel? Shall we to savage-wilds repair, To find this human monster there? On some inhospitable shore, With tygers, wolves, and bears, explore? No; in Britannia's native streets, One daily such a monster meets. Haste, reader, his dread haunts escape, A vulture for his prey agape. And Oh! the servile task excuse, So foul a picture to peruse. The pen how despicably mean, To touch a subject so unclean! That had contended for the bays In some immortal hero's praise; Such heroes as Britannia boasts, The grace and bulwark of her coasts Written in the year 1762.! How could the numbers condescend With such a pigmy to contend! How prostitute their sacred rage, A worm on dunghills to engage! Yet, for amends, we next shall add A character not quite so bad; So, gentle reader, pray compose Your ruffled brow, and straight your nose. ZALATES. A MODERN CHARACTER. Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur. Hor. A bard, whose laurel never dies, To women characters denies. But, with more justice from his pen, He might have hence degraded men; Or chang'd his note, with cadence sad; Better no characters, than bad. On Zalates the satire falls, Him fame here an example calls. Phantastic humour, oddness, whim, Are our just character of him. Bless'd with a fond and virtuous wife, That first-rate happiness of life; Esteem'd for prudence, and for sense, Her love of Virtue no pretence; In authors just discreetly read, Agreeable, polite, well-bred; Whom none behold without respect, And but a blockhead could neglect: With this fair, kind companion blest, He's tasteless—Reader, guess the rest. Yet, slighted thus his own, he strives To dote on other people's wives. So hugely fond would he appear, He scarce can bear a rival near. His goddess by the hand to take, Would all his jealousy awake; Ruffle his righteous spirit more, Than if his ? became a ? The very husband scarce can smile, If he but present is the while. Nor need uxorious pride take fire, Poor Zalates has no desire. He scarce his tremblings can command, Only to touch the fair-one's hand. But thus he well preserves his name, From sheepish fear, and coward shame. The blood would his plump cheeks forsake, Were he a balmy kiss to take; But here, not Virtue influences, Nor modesty, his torpid senses. Some men are good, for reason sad, They have not courage to be bad; The will inclines, but in its part, From downright instinct, fails the heart. Hence, Zalates can boast no merit, But mere want of address and spirit. What happiness, to all around, In our proud Sultan's favour found! Thus pleasing but himself, he shows, The charming art to please he knows. While he but gratifies his senses, Joy in proportion he dispenses; As, fed by juices from the ground, Oaks spread a kind protection round; For he, bless'd with his darling fair, His constant unuxorious care; Oft from pure gratitude, as due, Their distant mates obliges too. You ask if these sultanas are Charming surpassingly and fair, Somewhat to justify his taste, And fondness, so absurdly plac'd! No; but ineffably outshone By her whom wedlock makes his own; Outshone in manners, sense, and wit, Don Quixote-like were he not smit. But only novelties are rated, Clara's long since domesticated. But let not Clara take amiss So whimsical a scene as this. Beneath her own auspicious roof (How can the Muse refrain reproof?) Others, though Clara never err'd, To her romanticly preferr'd. Thus she escapes much awkward love, That would almost one's stomach move. Herself in peace and calm enjoys, And, as she likes, her time employs. At all if anxious, hence the smart, Lest from her mate his whims depart; When too, with all their vapours on, Her doughty rivals would be gone. Ah! what a storm would then break out, And burst in thunder all about? Oaths, curses, and I know not what Of little, dirty, peevish chat; Though with much modesty we rate, Enough to outnoise Billingsgate. In elbow-chair set sulky down, How would he low'r, and gloom, and frown! Pout out his lips in sullen mood, Or bite his nails, or spurn his food! His voice in perfect fury raise, Finding gross fault where he should praise! This servant call, and roundly scold, Neglecting—what he ne'er was told! Another and another still, That he may rant and rave his fill; Till he has luculently prov'd, He neither dreaded is, nor lov'd! How does our mighty 'squire appear, With twice three thousand pounds a-year? As void of manners, taste, and sense, As who but count as many pence. What value, then, has Fortune's favours, Unbought by Virtue's fond endeavours? Yes; God chose Zalates, to show How he despises wealth below. See yonder heav'n-protected saint! He scorns to utter one complaint, Although (blush! blush! ye scarlet-clad) He boasts no more than daily bread. And why? our saint must shortly rise, To live an angel in the skies. Gold would pollute him, and debase, As spots obscure the diamond's blaze. Oft Fortune makes (fine raree-show!) A fool more eminently so. A simple fellow, at the spade, Passes, as suited to his trade; But coach'd, and posting to the city, Could you behold him without pity? Did Zalates but drive a plough, Much might he be respected now; His manners and behaviour pass Full-well with many a cottier-lass: But plac'd beneath a lofty roof, While worthy men must stand aloof; Set at his table's ample side, In haughty state and formal pride; Or lolling in his warm machine, Loaded with beef-stakes, bile, and spleen; Who can behold him, damn'd by station, Without disgust and indignation? Say not, with half-offended air, The pointed satire's too severe. The picture's justly sketch'd, you own, Yet blame so little mercy shown. Mercy, or out of mode, or time, Becomes, in Virtue's eye, a crime. Improper objects too to chuse, Is Justice grossly to abuse. Mercy, to all the species, calls, When Justice on delinquents falls. The colours might be deeper still, Did Candour not restrain the quill. Only the outlines have we drawn, Then kindly interpos'd the lawn; Yet still preserv'd the likeness so, That he his (better) self may know. Mankind, if they attentive be, May likewise some resemblance see. Hence, haply, the satiric page May read a lecture to the age; In one (whom vainly you explore) Aptly epitomize a score For Zalates not single stands, Though singly him the satire brands. Oft his caprices we may call, The whims and oddities of all. Yet him for these we might o'erlook, Not by good-nature too forsook. Good-nature many failings hides, In that soft breast where it resides; But sure for him one pity feels, Whose littleness not this conceals. The whole employment of his life, Checker'd abundantly with strife, Is the sublime task—not of thinking, But eating (like his herds) and drinking. Saunt'ring among his oaks and elms, While kindred gloom his soul o'erwhelms; Gazing whole forenoons on the brook, With idiot emptiness of look; Feasting his eye, his smell, his taste, Amid his spacious orchards plac'd; Yet hence alone his pleasures strike, That scarce one neighbour boasts the like: His neighbour's policy commend, His fields enlarge, his groves extend; Increase his rents, augment his dues, Him (strange!) insultingly you use; His taste, superiour taste, assert, You thrust a dagger to his heart. Behold him next at open'd sash, To hear the noisy cascade dash; To see what bounteous Nature yields, Through his extensive lawns and fields; But with no sentiment that shows, A soul struck with what she bestows; But struck (no mends his virtues make) That one day he must all forsake; Die, like his meanest vassal, die, And close eternally his eye; While no sad heirs in sorrow weep, But jubilees unceasing keep. So little man in him we trace, He scarce can look you in the face; So much with boyish shame confus'd, To manly cares so little us'd. And whence that dark reserve of look? (How oft for modesty mistook!) From some bad consciousness within, That would in act amount to sin; Some strange ambiguous cast of thought, That nothing fears but to be caught; Dreading lest in his features we His naked heart detected see. Silent because he's forc'd to be, From downright pure—inanity; Whoe'er the sin of speech commits, He pouts, he frowns, he coughs, he spits; Or else exclaims, to vent his spleen, G?'s curse! what do the babblers mean? To laugh, though it you fitly time, With him is to commit a crime. And why? because the dolt can see, He has no merit in the glee. His stoicism's here all spite, He ne'er could yet a laugh excite; Unless at ridicule's arch call, The jest aim'd at himself by all. He lives, which many years have prov'd, Scarce once respected, or belov'd; And, when his latter end draws nigh, Shall as sure unlamented die. If these, a large but true account, With men to character amount, Then charact'ris'd our hero call, Although he must be damn'd with all; Damn'd by the candid, good, and wise, Till the last spark of virtue dies. Let mankind then astonish'd be, Nor fabulous the centaur see. The keenest pen him mildly uses, Who grossly all mankind abuses; Who the foul trump of Slander fills, Despises the command, and kills. And why flows scandal from his tongue, By baneful asps and vipers stung? Why from the dunghill of his lips, Whence Malice her black poison sips, Issues Detraction's venom'd rage? Hence, he's the vilest of the age; For meanness unexampled lives, And merits that abuse he gives; Would thus, wrapt up in thin disguise, Divert the world's observing eyes. Curs'd he, who vile himself and low, Would have his fellow-mortals so! Silver'd with years the hoary head, And near the frontiers of the dead; Who once the thought can entertain, An age to have consum'd in vain? Cast into life (while angels weep) Most gloriously to—eat and sleep; Then drop, with carcase amply fed, Among the reptile-mangled dead! Scarce spoke one sentence, to reflect On his surviving name respect! Scarce done one action to engage The love of an applauding age! But in oblivion dread to fall, Like the dumb tenants of the stall! Without some sacred fund of bliss, For other worlds just leaving this; Something, to give the soul content, Resulting from a life well-spent; How less than nothing in our view Riches appear, and honours too? What then can sweeten fate's dread cup, Or keep the sinking spirits up? When Virtue's absent, what can save From the black horrours of the grave? Sunk in the darkness deep of guilt, Hope on no sure foundation built; No friends can his afflictions soothe, Or Death's rough, thorny tramit smoothe: Left to the torture of his mind, They shrink unfeeling all behind! Of manhood, peace, and joy forsook, With terrour pictur'd in his look, All doubt, distraction, gloom, despair, He sinks down, down, he knows not where! Let Zalates then, ere too late, Think on this crisis of his fate. This will the Muse's fee discharge, For thus describing him at large. To all too let the hint extend, Our frailty, and our latter end; Of higher import to the wise, Than Newton's theory of the skies; Beyond, not all ambition gone, Europa's diadems in one. “O Thou! who sitt'st above the clouds, “From mortal eye whom darkness shrouds, “Yet, to the seraph's dazzled sight, “Array'd in majesty of light! “Thou greatest, first, and last, and best! “O grant me, gracious, my request! “(If one, great God! so mean as I, “Dare thy eternal throne draw nigh) “Not to be rich, see! Lazarus dies, “Borne by the patriarch to the skies; “Not great, for Jesus, it is read, “Had not whereon to lay his head! “But, praising Thee my latest breath, “To die the humble Christian's death. “And oh! thy inspiration give, “That I his life may previous live.” Reader, smile not, of all degrees, To see a poet on his knees; But rather go well-pleas'd away, A bard, un-brethren-like, can pray. And Oh! the Muse's counsel take, As you have happiness at stake: Would you be lov'd and honour'd too, And please yourself upon review? Act from a downright honest heart, And ever scorn the dubious part. Let Nature prompt your actions still, Direct your choice, inform your will; Nature we mean, all doubts apart, Oppos'd to little cunning art. Be still yourself, nor e'er affect To ape rank, person, mode, or sect. Ourselves might oft escape the pen, Were we not apes of other men. Did Zalates rate this advice, By Candour fram'd, at its just price; Were he but happily endu'd With the great thirst of doing good; Virtue herself might condescend To prize his gold, and style him friend. For what is wealth heap'd on a few, To whom by Nature nothing's due? The means externally design'd For the joint welfare of mankind. Hence Indigence in human guise, Men poor, though destin'd for the skies. What numbers beg their daily bread, In tatters cloth'd, by morsels fed; That those, whose coffers overflow, Their prompt munificence may show; And thus, while Pity's hands extend, In Merit's glorious scale ascend! By Heav'n the wealthy are decreed, The poor with liberal hand to feed; To clothe the naked, and relieve The heart-felt pangs of those that grieve. The poor, the naked, and distrest, Not without gratitude are blest; To Heav'n their warm petitions rise, And hence the rich obtain the skies. Thus, mutual friends to one another, A clown may style a king his brother. All men from one first parent came, Howe'er disjoin'd by rank, or name. All on a level, as first made, By eye omniscient are survey'd. And who can wisdom here impeach? Like mortal and immortal each. Riches then no distinction make, Whate'er bold freedoms rich men take; Unless, still to augment our charge, Our spheres of action to enlarge. If nobly faithful to our trust, (As all to be acquitted must) Our debtors then become mankind, And we in Heav'n shall credit find. The rich man (but how few practise!) Is but a factor for the skies; Accountable, when fates unfold, Even for his smallest mite of gold, How then shall Zalates appear? How pay to Heav'n his vast arrear? That wealth he fondly calls his own, Is but assign'd him as a loan, Which, on some great important day, He must with all its interest pay. But if insolvent found, what plea Can set the judg'd delinquent free? His pride men cruelly may feed, But angels call him poor indeed. Thus has the pencil been employ'd, (Much with the task its master cloy'd) To draw that portrait, which requir'd A genius like a Swift's inspir'd. O! did it occupy some place, A Pharos to the human race, Some station between earth and sky, To strike the universal eye! Yet had undrawn the picture been, A novelty had pass'd unseen; Had Satire's voice been silent, when This great original of men Justly provok'd her honest rage, And offer'd laurels to the page; The stones themselves had silence broke, And, to mankind's amazement, spoke. Yet, though gall in abundance flows, No gross abuse the verse bestows. Though keen its flight the arrow wings, No poison it from malice brings. Had the Horatian quill been mine, Or, Young, thou British Flaccus, thine! Not Zephyr-like, through osiers wreath'd, My strains had innocently breath'd, But loud and terrible, awoke, And with the voice of thunder spoke; Sublime on eagle's pinion rose, Above the grov'ling flights of prose. THE TRIUMPH OF VICE. A FRAGMENT. Addressed to James Stevenson, Esq; Hoc fonte derivata clades In patriam populumque fluxit. Hor. Not to the flowery margin of a stream, Where gentle murmurs soothe the anxious thought; Not to the broider'd vale, the upland glade, Cool grotto, wide-stretch'd lawn, or rising hill, The Muse invites; nor philosophic gloom, Where Contemplation holds her pensive court, And Philomel her tender throat attunes To Love's soft languishments: far other scenes, Far other objects, would engage thy eye, That eye which will a brother's faults o'erlook, And spy a beauty where the world sees none: While others sing of Virtue's godlike charms, And feel her raptures, while their numbers flow Harmonious in her praise; mine be the task, Less-lov'd, to draw her opposite, and thine. O did the powers of Akenside inspire My humble pen! his fancy, feeling, taste, And energy of thought; his manly flow Of eloquence; his judgment strong, as clear, Profound, as strong, and as profound, correct! What emperour on earth can boast a sway So ample, so uncircumscrib'd, as Vice? What king so many subjects round his throne, Or prostrate slaves devoted to his nod? Few potentates can boast their state secure From rebels and from traitors, boldly bent On success to their projects, or a grave; Dreadful alternative! but she, by all Her votaries so faithfully obey'd, Scarce knows an enemy, but domineers, With lordly rule, and insolence uncheck'd, Both o'er her subjects properties and lives. O Vice, how formidable is thy power, How num'rous, how diversified thy train! Sloth, with her hair, in dirty uncomb'd lengths, Loit'ring upon her shoulders, stretching out Her lazy limbs, with many a gape and yawn, To push the sluggish current through her veins. Lust with her wanton leer, and glance obscene, Her lurid cheek, dim eye, and fœtid breath, O'er-run with biles impure, and foul disease, A nausea to herself. Swoln Gluttony, With pamper'd visage, and foul scarlet nose, And bloated skin; scarce able to support His beastly load of fat, gorg'd to the throat With luscious meats; cadaverous the smell That from his fungous lungs, through putrid rows Of crusted teeth, streams suffocating; soon His well-fed carcase to regale the worm, The hungry, thankless worm. Set by the bowl His boon companion, Drunkenness; with voice Vociferous, and eye that wildly reels In its broad socket, index to his thoughts: While horrid oaths and blasphemies burst forth From falt'ring lips, and paralytic tongue. Boast, savage, in thy nightly range for blood, Loud bellowing to the rock's unconscious dells, Thy reason—man's prerogative no more. Nor these alone thy minions, that attend Around thee, caught by thy alluring glance, And fascinated by thy smile: behold! What servile crouds officiously demand Admittance in our song, proud to be rank'd With thee, and all the vilest of mankind. Base cowardice, that boldly turns his face On every thing but danger, never acts With honesty, but when he runs away. Corruption, with her base and impious bribe Extended in her hand, to buy men off From conscience, duty, loyalty; to sear The heart against humanity's soft pang, The liberal hope, and patriotic wish, The foe of Virtue, Freedom's mortal foe. Envy, with eye askance, distorted look, And pining heart; serpents curl'd hissing round Her squalid locks. Hypocrisy smooth tongu'd, With lamb-like features, and with dove-like eyes, Although within a tyger. Mean Deceit, Malice, Revenge, and Jealousy: Remorse, Lash'd with a thousand scorpions, at his breast A thousand vultures gnawing; wild Despair, On whose dark brow the gloom of midnight lours; With garments torn, and countenance deep mark'd With horrour; fixing his determin'd eye On the drawn dagger, cord, or poison'd cup. Disease, with wan, emaciated cheek, Glaz'd, hollow eyes, and flatten'd temples, shrunk And dwindled to a shadow; gasping hard For breath, toss'd in deliriums, or o'erwhelm'd In apoplectic lethargy: hard by Silent his tread, invisible, pale Death, Frowning on Time, his ling'ring sands unspent. O Vice! how formidable is thy pow'r! How num'rous, how diversified thy train! How glorious once was Nature! how august Her works! how exquisite her charms, admir'd By angels and by gods! ere Pain, and Shame, And Death, admonish'd mankind of thy birth! Then Innocence, in snow-white mantle clad, From Heav'n to Earth a smiling cherub sent, Attended by her gentle handmaids, Love, Truth, Friendship, Candour, Equity, Joy, Peace, Health, with her sparkling eye, her balmy breath, And Beauty blooming with immortal youth, Took up her residence with humankind, Nor wish'd an habitation better form'd To her peculiar taste, well-pleas'd below To find that Paradise she left above: But when the sun, from his celestial height, Saw thee approach the frontiers of our world, Hid in delusive form, and usher'd in By Lucifer, fall'n spirit! hell itself Freed of its worst inhabitant; behold! Then Innocence, in snow-white clad, From Heav'n to Earth a smiling cherub sent, Attended by her gentle handmaids, Love, Truth, Friendship, Candour, Equity, Joy, Peace, Health with her sparkling eye, her balmy breath, And Beauty blooming with immortal youth; Bade Earth and its inhabitants adieu, Happy, abandon'd and despis'd, above To gain that Paradise she lost below. Behold her, now, array'd in sweeping robes Of garter'd statesman, insolent and vain, With air contemptuous, and with head aloft, Solemn and grave, affectedly serene, As if—not a black villain at the heart. With deep research of thought, sublime resolve, With Pitt's head furnish'd, but without his heart, How he the noble, gen'rous scheme conceives, The patriotic scheme of—growing rich! What tho' the foe should triumph o'er our fleets, And Victory desert our dastard arms, No gallant arm to interpose relief? Unmov'd he stands, like the storm-beaten rock, Enjoys our doom, or rises on our fall. Thus, with small things the greatest to compare, When rolling flames some wealthy roof assail, The sons of plunder, exquisitely base, Calm, unconcern'd, through suffocating fires, Split rafters, half-burn'd beams, and sinking floors, Slide, as through chaos hell's arch fiend, to spread The sheeted conflagration, and to Steal. The gamester, next, creeps forth at her command, Till he his fellow meets, some brainless wight, Unbless'd at home, unbless'd within himself, Whom Heav'n has curs'd with riches. Lo! they meet, Robbers of others purses, though forsooth, Well-bred, polite, and courteous. In his hand, His hand more learn'd and knowing than his head, Each, with the matchless wisdom of a Hoyle, Deals the mysterious pack; or on the board, With ceaseless rattle, and with artful twirl, Throws the twin spotted dice, on ev'ry cast Depending—sons and daughters, friends and wives. But see the duellist, whose poltroon heart Would quake with terrour, his unmanly knees Together smite, his hair stand all on end With fear, his blood creep freezing thro' his veins, Were he to face the cannon's mouth, or walk Left by his friend abruptly, in the dark; See him (a murderer his fitter name) Impell'd by something foreign to himself, Hight man of honour, seal the fatal card, That, haply, sends his soul (O glorious deed!) His trembling soul, to hell before its time. Him Vice still keeps industrious in her pay, Lest her immortal interests might decline; Lest real Honour might usurp her right, And noblest friendships influence mankind: Lest the afflicted parent ne'er should weep Her son, her hope, her joy, untimely slain; Children their sire snatch'd from each clasping arm; A wife her husband torn from her embrace, By violence and death; thus to provoke All hell to rage, on mischief ever bent. But now remark her in far other dress, In the mean peasant's tatter'd garments clad, Who scarcely by laborious toil acquires What keeps together soul and body, hides His shiv'ring limbs from the cold wintry blast. But though thus wretched in exteriour form, Not so in thought; ambition swells his breast, To imitate the follies of the great, A perfect clown beside, as instanc'd here, Still something worse. Amid the rustic ring, He struts, talks big, and swaggers, aims his scoff, And witty leer, at that old-fashion'd thing The Bible call'd, swears with outrageous air, Gets himself drunk, and whores, like any lord. The Miser too her livery assumes, His little heart contracted to a point, A callous point, to every thing but gold, The god whom he adores. Worn to the bone With misery and want, he stands confess'd A breathing type of death. Yet Death anon Will not his likeness spare, but snatch his soul To—not to Paradise, for ah! he leaves His Paradise behind; to—not to hell, For actual hell were needless, when alone Absence from his beloved gold, were hell, Heated to all the scorching rage of flame— Nor shall his brother, his congenial half, (Detested couple) hight Monopolist, Unnoted pass. So might a fiend escape, Sent from Perdition's dungeon, to defraud, To torture, to distress the sons of men. Worse than the hurricane that spreads around Ruin and devastation; than the plague That sweeps away whole multitudes, and leaves Cities and provinces one horrid blank; Worse than the earthquake that expands its jaws, And swallows millions at one mighty gape; Worse than the gorg'd volcano, that o'erwhelms Whole districts in its seas of liquid fire; Abroad he moves with more than devil's glee, To deepen human woes, to heighten grief, Already unsupportable, and add Anguish to pain, and to dire want despair! These dreadful judgments incident to man, (Man buffeted by elements, expos'd To all Earth's dire convulsions) ne'er imply Will or intention: his grand scheme of life, His settled purpose, is, to starve mankind. Rumour! whence comes she, with impatient step, And attitude of haste? breathless she comes, Meaning impress'd on each important look. Thus runs the purport of her ready tale, “Vice oft assumes the sacerdotal robe, “And struts beneath the mitre and the vest.” What! clergymen plead guilty to the charge? Forbid it, Heaven! blast, celestial Truth! The bold assertion, if disown'd by thee! Shall Virtue's ministers, the sacred priests At chaste Religion's altar, men employ'd In saving souls, the heralds of the skies, Ambassadours of Heav'n; shall such forget Their characters, their office, to attend The palaces and levees of the great, To catch a paltry nod, or empty smile; Who should exhaust the pathos of discourse, To lessen them in our esteem, and teach A mind superiour to the pomp of kings? Shall men of God, with prostituted knee, Worship at Honour's tinsel shrine? pay court To Fortune, basking on the topmost point Of sun-gilt pinnacle, still turning round, As flows the fickle current of the air? Shall preachers of humility assume The turgid look, or supercilious air? Shall messengers of peace, of love, embroil, And plunge themselves in faction? enter fierce The hackney'd list of libellers? increase The public spleen? with random censure blast The best and fairest characters? foment The rage of civil discord? fan the fire Of argument and disputation? all, —To share a dinner at a patron's board: Their flocks meantime, no guardian shepherd nigh, Left and abandon'd to the rude attack Of Vice and Errour; fatal, as night-wolves, Or tygers, to the fold. Such better far, Had serv'd their king and country in the field, With hat cockaded, and with knotted sword, A carnal weapon fit for carnal men; Trench'd in the quirks and subtilties of law, Wielded their wordy thunder at the bar; Or with the riban'd cane, and full-spread wig, Prescrib'd the lancet, julep, or the pill: Such better had been sons of Traffic, bred Learn'dly to count and discount at the desk; Mechanics, fiddlers, players; taught, in fine, To handle spades, tend flocks, or hold the plough; Than thus our pulpits wretchedly supply'd With men, whose well-bred fashionable lips Not, for the world, would purposely accent That monosyllable of terrour—hell, Uncouth, as obsolete; afraid to meet The frown that threatens from a grandee's brow, Nothing more impotent—except his smile. Yet, some there are, who in a storm of words, A cushion-aided eloquence, exhaust Their own strain'd lungs, and overwhelm the ear With mere noise, and unsentimental sounds; Vociferating, with the thunder's voice, Hell and damnation, all their genius spent In these tremendous accents, foisted in, Without grace, meaning, or propriety; Nor with success; for such command the eye, Alarm the ear, but never reach the heart. Ah! how unlike the theologues of old Our modern parsons! strikingly unlike, In manners and address! but rarely seen That plain simplicity of garb, of life That unaffected innocence; that calm, That humble, meek deportment, which so well Become our teachers, and examples too! How many, ah! absurdly think their task Perform'd, their duty done, but to expound A solitary text one day in seven; The rest devoted to the endless round Of saunt'ring and amusement, sordid cares, Pursuits and studies, foreign to the gown! Such may do all mere human laws exact, To earn a yearly stipend; such may pass With well-bred patrons, or a noble Lord, All whose religion, in the aggregate, Is lolling on a cushion once a-week, To hear a pray'r pronounc'd, or sermon read: But Reason thinks her dignity concern'd In not absolving such; while Conscience joins Reason in all her scruples; and what both, According in their sentence, right announce, Heav'n surely must in equity affirm. Ah! how unlike the theologues of old Our modern parsons! strikingly unlike! Save in some wretched corner of the land, Where, from hard, blunt necessity, not choice, In thread-bare suit attir'd, unless perchance, Half naked, as half-starv'd, some simple wight A curate call'd, is fain to vend his pot Of nappy ale, or glass of apple-juice, As if the labourer not worth his hire; Or, lower still, to enter the foul sty, With bands and cassock thrown aside, to feed His bristly hoglings, grunting for their draff. Yet better scatt'ring acorns here, than pearls Despis'd, elsewhere, before far other swine. Thus the poor tatter'd curate spends his days, Unenvied, yet, perhaps, esteem'd and lov'd; Toiling in Heav'n's own vineyard, yet no drop Of the choice vintage to inspire his heart With gladness; nor needs our Nathanael such Prelatic, royal comfort, to support him, His conduct blameless, as his manners chaste, His mind contented, and his conscience clear; His Maker's wages these, as that mere man's. Thus lives our humble curate, far from strife, Save the illustrious strife of doing good; Far from his mitred brethren, as remote Haply, from him, in sense and virtue, they, Clearness of head, and probity of heart. But what fine object now attracts the Muse, Struck with superiour awe? beauteous as Morn, When she the portals of the east expands, With rosy finger; all divine her form, In presence like a queen, she moves along Lovely in ev'ry step, and looking round Pleasure ineffable; her mien, her air, Grace, ease, and majesty; her soften'd eye Bright with the sparkle of a midnight star. Each lineament Complacence marks serene, Candour, and Sweetness. On her charming neck, Her shaded neck, soft as the downy peach, The virgin snow, with no ignoble pride, Bestows its purest whiteness, left behind Its native cold. On every dimpled cheek Roses emit their bloom, the bloom of youth, Of innocence, of health; nor here confin'd, But lavish all their sweets upon her breath That steals through lips of coral. Furnish'd thus With graces, airs, and smiles, beyond the touch Of pencil, or the drapery of words; Say not that Vice, presumptuous, dare approach An angel in terrestrial guise, unless From her fair presence to retire, abash'd And overaw'd. Let Censure's tongue be mute, And Slander bite her lips in silent spite. Truth turns aside offended from the tale. For see how charming looks Camilla, set Deep in the umbrage of a woodbine bow'r, Conversing with the learned Dead, who live, More than mechanically live, beyond Detraction's reach, safe from the poison'd fangs Of Calumny, in the immortal page: Authors, where Virtue shines in native charms Of chaste simplicity, and undeform'd With philosophic daub; where manly Wit Flashes his sprightly sallies, Fancy glows With all her picturesque descriptive pow'rs, And force of imagery; such still as charm In Milton's page sublime, seraphic bard! In Pope's mellifluous numbers, or in Young's, That master of the eloquent and grand; Or flowing Thomson's well-imagin'd strains, Or Akenside's, or Shenstone's: names inscrib'd On monuments more permanent than brass. There, amiable maid! in beauty's bloom, In youth's, in health's, exemplify'd she shows, How each exteriour grace, each skin-deep charm, And elegance of manner, by a mind Enlarg'd by thought and reading, is improv'd. Behold Dulcissa exquisitely pleas'd, While she admires the needle's arts display'd Creative; sees the smooth, or figur'd lawn, The fine-wrought linen, or soft cambric spun With all the nicety of spider's web, Or costly stuffs from Indian climes convey'd, Chang'd in their texture, form, and surface, now No more the uniform and simple thread, But richly vein'd with curious Dresden work, Or rough with elegant embroidery. Touch'd by the magic needle in her hand, What noble figures on the canvas swell, Tumid with silver, cotton, or with silk! How accurate that hand, that gentle hand, Which all their well-conceiv'd proportions fram'd, With finish'd delicacy, and bestow'd Their striking statures, colours, and attire! Well may a new creation of her own Delight her gazing eye, and heave her breast With sentimental pride; Almira thus Still Scipio's noble maxim may adopt, While objects, wheresoe'er she casts her glance, Court her survey, and almost seem to breathe. There Candour, with her open honest face, And eye of soften'd sparkle; Beauty drawn With more than mortal likeness; Modesty In virgin white attir'd, and Meekness plac'd In silent downcast attitude, afraid, Her look, her air, her gesture might offend. In vain would Sylvia, self-approv'd, pretend To rival these bright patterns of her sex; Sylvia the subject of each coxcomb's lay, And boast of every fop, howe'er set off With all the finery of mode and dress, Her handmaids, Taste and Fancy; underneath The pomp of silks, and jewels; on light toe Conscious she moves along, by all admir'd, In the smooth measures of the minuet-dance; Or salient trips the floor's elastic board, With step accordant to the sprightly jigg: The room all odour'd with the rich perfumes, That from her shining locks profusely breathe, Or handkerchief, or bottle's crystal tube, While to her smell applied, her lovely hand Displays a white scarce rivall'd by the snow. Thus, while to courts and levees others croud, To bask in sunshine of a grandee's smile, (Short as the glow-worm's twinkle, and as cold) Put on a face occasional, relax'd And smooth with adulation, to belie Their lurking hearts; the Muse has turn'd aside With indignation, to inform mankind What company there awaits them. But enough Of Vice, ignoble, and unpleasing theme! Away, thou monster, since men fell from Heav'n, Too much admir'd; away from all the haunts Of humankind, with thy associates dire, Disease and Infamy—But O! begone Chiefly from Britain's celebrated isles, The seat of Empire, Liberty, and Peace, Of Learning, Commerce, and the Muses.—Vice May triumph, but let Virtue not despair. To the Honourable ?. An EPISTLE. Tell me, dear ?, all impatient grow, For you perchance alone the secret know; What climate now a certain bard conceals, Who writes what others wrote, yet seldom steals; Who knows to cull, in gardens flush'd with flow'rs, Each one that fairest smiles, or tallest tow'rs, Yet, with strange whim, almost beyond compare, Oddly prefers the lowest, and least fair: Say, why in silence lies your poet's pen? Sure bards are rank'd among the first of men— Else why flow'd music from Pope's tuneful tongue? Why not forgot that Addison once sung? Young had not else high-soar'd on wings of fire, Nor Milton stole from Heav'n a seraph's lyre, Through all the wide Creation's glorious round, Is no fit theme to suit his genius found? No Season, to transfer into his page The grove's soft music, or the tempest's rage? Can he the world of politics survey, Or morals, not less circumscrib'd than they; Hear Fame's loud trumpet sound Britannia's praise, Nor yet find subjects worthy of his lays? If blame and odium to excite he's loath, Let him remain conceal'd, and merit both. By formal rules Candour's ne'er taught to see, Hence Learning oft and Candour disagree. Candour beholds with fair and honest eye, But through lens optic Learning needs must spy. Thus faults are magnified beyond their due, And beauties render'd blemishes oft too. Thus Fulvia's neck appear like parchment may, And gems themselves a surface rough betray. But Nature means her objects to be seen, No artificial lying glass between; Through which our eagle-sighted critics look, When authors they would praise, that is, rebuke. Yet we confess, what some perfections deem, As faults to others may as justly seem; For who expects, as wonders cease to be, All should in looks, or sentiments agree, Must first reverse Heav'n's universal plan, And to an angel change the very man. Fictitious wings o'er streams successful skim, Inform us then what bait will answer him. Though the sinn'd victim might from harm have stray'd, He spies, pursues, he leaps, and is betray'd: Yet others boldly near the surface swim, And seize secure the insects as they skim. But how uncertain oft the trial leaves, When Nature courts us, or when Art deceives! Haply of both the specious lure's the same, The insect's pinion, or the plume of fame; That hides a point, how fatal to the brook! A dagger this, oft dreadfully mistook! Your bard is silent, yet what numbers praise! But writing would with some his merit raise. Let him, undazzled by the shine of pelf, Examine well his motive in himself. If nothing hence gives vigour to his pen, Let him remain—the silentest of men. Say then, dear ?, does the verse invite The nameless author, or forbid, to write? The author nameless, though to you well known, Who for another's beauties slights his own. Builds on foundations laid from others' pelf, Though few can lay a better than himself; As yonder sun shines feebly by the moon, Though he can blaze in majesty at noon. If you the question can discreetly solve, Go clear those doubts Time's thickest mists involve. LAURIA. At still Night's solitary watch, Half of mankind sunk in debauch, While with their gold starv'd misers share The wakeful agony of care, And screech-owls, with ill-boding pow'rs, Hoot through lone walls and haunted tow'rs; At yonder desk see Lauria sit, Fond to be styl'd a sister-wit Her pen and standish wait hard by, The snowy sheets before her lie, The snowy sheets (what have they done?) Soon with foul blots to be o'er-run. How soft she looks in midnight-gown, Sweeping all negligently down, The sleeves (quake, insects, for your sins) In much disorder stuff'd with pins! Below her chin a nightcap ties, To shade her features in disguise, Left she might ever tempted be, In glass her naked face to see; For sure we vanity rank in The meanest acts of venial sin. A riband, garter-like, around Keeps her full head-dress fitly bound; Yet, in despite of all her care, Oft peeps out rudely straggling hair. To veil her downy swan-white neck, The daring footman's gaze to check, An handkerchief she wraps about, Of dainty russet, plain and stout: Tuck'd in the foldings of her gown, The cross-laid ends hang dangling down. That nought may incommode the muse, She slides along in undress-shoes. Slippers we mean; for always kind, She hates her guiltless feet to bind, Learn, ye fastidious virgins, hence, To save each useless vain expense. How humble Lauria, and how meek, Though youth still triumphs in her cheek! Rather than needless trouble give, She greatly deigns—in dirt to live. Thus, dress'd in Nature's simple prime, (Conceit was Lucifer's first crime) In sweet Humility's plain suit, Artless, but elegant to boot; Lauria, in happy mood to think, Ventures straightway on pen and ink. Beware, ye bards of low degree, Her satire points at you and—me. Lauria is yet a maid; how then Can she refrain her virgin pen? Were she arriv'd at full five score, We might indeed our fears give o'er. But if not wedlock-join'd till then, Have mercy on the sons of men! Lauria unwed, can she refuse To raise up children to the Muse? For lo! to thwart eternal fate, Two females here can procreate; Furnish'd with that fell thing, a pen, Scorn the virility of men. Still more, our wonder forth to draw, Conceive and bear unwed by law. Nor marvel, Lauria still should prove Almost unmatch'd in tender love. Her infants seem, one with another, All striking transcripts of the mother. But, to the offspring of her brain, Begot and born with so much pain, Since Lauria shows such constant care, Shows all the softness of the fair; A prejudice that stands excus'd, To near and dear connections us'd; Who would wish Lauria, sane in mind, A parent of another kind? Who would not husbands too refuse, For their espousals with the Muse? All, she excepted, from mere spite, Who ev'ry thing can do but—write. Her needle, no false taste to show, Lauria abandon'd long ago. And sure her fame this to disperse is, Her needle ah! can write no verses. A needle, made of ruthless steel, Women must hate, while women feel. It puts one cruelly in mind, Of murders acted on mankind; Dreadful, in the same conscious breath, Alarms with blood, and wounds, and death. What chillness too it thought brings dire on, Dozing for ever o'er cold iron! With quills be female battles fought, But, brandish steel!—tremendous thought! “Amid the languid calm of life, “Hoping one day to be a wife, “Who, with a soul born to aspire, “Those cares and duties can admire, “Though ne'er her temper out of joint, “Plac'd on a sorry needle's point? “The task of sewing seems design'd “For females of the lower kind, “Of knowledge thus far unbereft, “To know their right hand from their left; “Dowdies, that never yet could hit “On one bright sally of true wit; “Give a smooth harmonious turn, “Or with poetic fervour burn; “But born eternally to pore, “And do the same thing o'er and o'er; “Nor feel, so lifeless the employ, “One soft thrill of tumultuous joy. “Who, as a housewife, can pretend “Her name through distant climes to send? “Macaulay's palm historic claim, “Or rise to Sappho's height of fame? “Give me but paper, pen, and ink, “And leisure undisturb'd to think; “Think on a selfish, tasteless age, “And vent my bitterness and rage; “To show (what transport it implies!) “That creature, man, I can despise; “Give Lauria these, to others then, “She leaves the task of—nursing men, “To dull domesticated wives, “Content with mere existing lives; “Content to plod on with their spouses, “And live on frowns within their houses; “In little, silly, whining chat, “To praise and censure this, and that; “Still, still the burden of the song, “Indeed, my dear, you're in the wrong. Thus Lauria would do all she can To pour a great revenge on men. See yon emasculated race, In each the female you may trace, So soft, so delicate, so nice, So mortally afraid of—mice. If but the winds presume to blow, They dull and melancholy grow, Lest on their gentle organs cold Should through some fatal chink take hold. If reptiles innocently crawl, Or from the roof a spider fall; “Good Heav'n! the death-cold faint's come on! “The bottle! for my master's gone!” If thus the masculines in sex Females become, nor Nature tax; If thus, with unambitious mind, Infringe the rights of women-kind; Lauria's resolv'd revenge to take, And just the like encroachments make. To see a thousand victims die, She scorns on beauty to rely. Lauria affects much to despise The fire-wing'd arrows of the eyes. Far other weapons would she chuse, Prepar'd and sharpen'd by the Muse. Those of her coward sex she scorns, Like insects butting with their horns; But boldly wrests from lordly men That mighty weapon call'd a pen. Turn'd on ourseves, can we pretend E'er to escape our latter end? No; fall we must, or Heav'n displease, That is, by nature, or disease. Hail, Lauria! how sublime thy praise! Thou heroine of modern days! Arm'd with a quiver from Parnassus, The terrour of faint-hearted lasses, Who thy fierce onset can withstand, Or shun fate darted from thy hand? What sevenfold shield protection throw O'er mortals to avert the blow? Yes; Prudence interdicts delay, Gird up your loins and—run away. How else escape, with lucky star, A female thunderbolt of war? You live secure from Lauria's charms, Not Lauria terrible in arms. How happy Lauria's thus employ'd, And with the task too overjoy'd? Else had she wasted endless sighs, Now the shrin'd Muse's sacrifice, Of her choice china ware bereft, Nought but the broken fragments left, Thrown in a tempest on the floor, —For Tom forgot to shut the door. Her little lap-dog else had been The guiltless object of her spleen, Poor Cloe, whom, with fond delight, She in her bosom hugs all night. And why? no bedfellow she boasts, And ah! she trembles much for ghosts. Her bulfinch too had lost his eyes, Though happier far the finch that dies, Pierc'd by the execrable wire, Heated remorseless in the fire. Hard fate! his anguish to prolong, And beauty spoil, to mend his song! Sweet bird! that, ravish'd of his sight, His dirge had warbled day and night! But let thy notes in triumph rise, The Muse redeem'd thy pretty eyes; All Lauria's passions deep engag'd, That else far otherwise had rag'd; Allow'd no active thought to be Unoccupied, to torture thee. Such ills domestic had arose, Had Lauria deign'd not to compose; Had she, in disrespect of men, Preferr'd her needle to her pen. Thanks to that dignity of thought, Vainly with simple housewives sought; That elegance of taste refin'd, That delicately-feeling mind; Which scorn, with much becoming strife, The female drudgery of life. STELLA. Behold! in yonder study plac'd, Form'd with true principles of taste, Stella in learn'd retirement sits, Amid a group of sleeping wits. Sleeping, but not on down or chaff, But in a book-case, bound in calf; Cover'd with honourable dust, As medals spread with precious rust. Before her still some volume lies, She studies with quadruple eyes. Some love-stuff'd comedy perchance, Or Sophonisba, a romance. The science of the kitchen taught, How pasties and confections wrought. What Tillotson or Barrow wrote, For modish theologues to quote. Perhaps, her Pray'r-book, or her Bible, Which wits and geniuses would libel. Nay; nothing farther from her study, Writings, that make one's brains quite muddy, Or the reverse, and full as bad, Make wilding Fancy run stark mad. Earth's smaller wits would she despise, To soar with Newton to the skies; Living, cameleon-like, when there, Most sentimentally on air. Newton, who, with Lyncean eye, Travers'd the whole capacious sky; Who from some angel stole that plan, Which seems above mere mortal man! That plan, where worlds and systems great Roll, by fix'd laws, in glorious state. In her this adage prov'd we find, “Earth ne'er can satisfy the mind; “The mind, a stranger to content, “Beneath the moon ignobly pent.” Besides, what doth the text require? “To Heav'n still let the soul aspire.” For where abides her treasure, she Thinks there her heart should ever be. Thus she fulfills—in Newton's school, Each truly pious, Christian rule. Nor ask another reason, why Astronomers affect the sky. Let others read with head alert, Stella reads with enlighten'd heart. Let others chariots gilt admire, Stella mounts Newton's car of fire; Not through the Mall, her steeds all foam, But o'er Heav'n's argent fields to roam. Thus arguments our fair, mayhap, “Earth's but a point in Nature's map; “A little toy to Fortune thrown, “As from the tube the bubble blown; “In the dimensionless abyss, “Where one world lost we scarcely miss, “An atom, till the zephyr fails, “On which a midge in triumph sails; “A particle of sand, cast out, “Through boundless space to roam about; “Then, from its equilibrium tost, “In matter's mass collective lost: “Why then, ambition all forgot, “Inhabit this poor paltry spot, “Which meanest reptiles share with us, “And live, not more a monarch does?” Of fashions Stella seldom talks, Of auctions, sales, or public walks, The ball, assembly, play, or rout, Which half the sex grow mad about. These, left to the phantastic lass, Who can whole days at toilets pass, The strange task hackney'd o'er and o'er, To be—less charming than before; Her only glass, view'd with intense Survey, the telescopic lens. On planets, stars, and comets, she Can scarce one moment silent be; Far other stars than grandee's coat on, Which only unlearn'd females dote on, Which such alone fantastic prize, As Fate ne'er destin'd for the skies. Newton's arcanas Stella can Sublimely—trust to learned men; The laws of Gravity conceive, While triumphs vast her bosom heave, Mere household females ey'd with scorn, Better than thousands—never born; Or when, sometimes, her passions strong Would gravitate towards the wrong. The force centripetal she knows, That is, when she puts on her cloaths, That no pin from its hold departs, Nor from her waist the whalebone starts: Centrifugal, when from her eye Sparks of ingenious passion fly; When words (such sweets no wild bee sips) Fly off eccentric from her lips. Thus, without Euclid, Stella shows, The deep, deep mystery she knows, What strains it fitly can express? To speak (astonishing!) and dress. Nor to yon brighten'd fields of air Soars only our exalted fair, Whirl'd (no example to her sex ill) On ev'ry planet's flaming axle; But condescends, of problems weary, To lose a thought on Burnet's Theory, Which doubtless she can understand, Like any—lady of our land; Distress'd (the total who can tell huge?) To find out waters for the deluge; Doubting, as if a God of fable, Jehovah to produce them able. Of thoughts too to improve her stock, She much affects to dote on Locke; That mortal pitch'd upon, to show Reason how near divine below; Happy, not from the task he shrinks, But for her most humanely—thinks. He surely her esteem must share, Who lightens Stella's heaviest care; And the esteem of womankind, Who hence some good will always find; For busy'd thus, from Stella's lips Scandal no poison ever sips. ZEPHALINDA. Yes, Zephalinda fain would wed, And venture with a man to bed; If he can make it but appear, His rent's a thousand pounds a-year; The more above it still the better, But nought below it e'er will get her. Her darling you exact describe, If you can him with esquires tribe; Though it is hinted at by some, Artists succeed might—with a plum. Her wooer, to successful prove, Must with his bags in hand make love; The weightier they, our fair less nice, Her smiles fastidious bought by price: A guinea's jingle has more charms, More moving pow'rs, more soft alarms, Than all the pathos that abounds In mere articulated sounds: Alas! your oratorial youth Speak freely ev'ry thing but—truth. Come then, for Zephalinda's smile, Who talk this unaffected style; Above the vulgar daub of phrase, Which always want of taste betrays. Your language, without foreign aid, Untaught by Johnson, can persuade; The true Laconic mode of speech, Which scorns that sniv'ling term, beseech: Come, to receive, nor ever part, A Zephalinda's faithful heart; And sure—till gold and virtue one, You peace and joy must smile upon. Nor think our fair sultana can Impose upon the sons of men. Who voluntar'ly wears her chains, Value receiv'd, at least, obtains. For is she not supremely—witty, Though blockheads hence her yoke-mate pity? Who can her beauties half display? Blithe, courteous, young, polite, and gay. What further would Ambition crave? Come then, and buy the charming slave. Whether her suitor Whig or Tory, To our fair maid's a trifling story. Whether a Methodist, or Quaker, He (ev'ry Sunday) serves his Maker; With look demure, or priestly quirk, Obeys the high church, or the kirk. Whether, with three-tail'd wig, or bag, Some learn'd jurisprudential wag; Who nobly saves, when fools unlock it, His client's fortune—in his pocket. Whether a doctor of renown, Sweeping in sacerdotal gown; Who knows, to charm the ravish'd fair, All arts and sciences but—pray'r: Or, as nice qualms ne'er overstock'd her, A very downright carnal doctor; Who, when some malady has spent her, From death can save her—to torment her. But chief she likes, to tell the truth, A dear, dear military youth; Who never can to her prove cruel, Unless when he declines a—duel These all, if fortune makes them like, With equal charm of merit strike. Each thus, though pair'd like heav'n and hell, Becomes the other's parallel. Whate'er his colour, fair or brown, With carriage up, or carriage down; Whether a coxcomb, fop, or cit, With, or quite destitute of, wit; A boor, in fox-chace garments clad, Or court-spark, perfectly well bred: Whether a patriot of renown, In rolls of parliament set down; Or that fierce vindicator morum, Some plump-cheek'd justice of the quorum: In fine, whate'er his birth or rank, His money landed, or in bank; Whate'er through life his casual track is, A rake in theory, or in practice; If he can but commodious fix Our charmer in a coach and six, Such, if but physically man, Comes up to Zephalinda's plan: And justly too; for marriage, sure, Is not Love's, but Ambition's cure. Nor rashly Zephalinda blame, Not anxious more for wealth, than fame, Who fame's pursuit so far would carry, As to be wretched, that is, marry. Say, why the rich man she affects, And nobly merit poor neglects. Thus, to evince her Sterling wit, She greatly dotes on Sacred Writ; Would have its sayings all fulfill'd, And all its precepts deep instill'd; Concern'd, that consecrated book Should be for pert romance forsook; (How well she on the sense has stumbled!) Which says, “The proud man shall be humbled.” LUCIA. Fair Lucia, to no fortune born, Affects all nicety to scorn. Why should her virtue rigid prove? Why prove an enemy to love? Since Fortune's favours, ah! denied, In which such pleasures are implied; Why not indulge her tender mind In pleasures of another kind? Her state dependent cries aloud, “It ill becomes you to be proud.” Her wants in the same hint agree, “You ne'er can too obsequious be.” Thus, what a vice in others seems, She in herself a grace esteems. “Virtue but differs from a crime, “By certain rules of place and time; “Morality on mode depends, “With it declines, with it extends; “The mode our circumstances make, “Acting from them we ne'er mistake; “Our circumstances, right to count, “To fix'd necessity amount; “And sure, our inference to draw, “Necessity's above all law.” Thus, Lucia, with conviction still, Waves bold her philosophic quill; Despises Tillotson and Locke, And crushes Barrow at one shock. Go on, sweet maid!—O! what delight To think, “Whatever is, is right!” That partial ills, well understood, Will usher in the general good. Say, can a lovely female err, Who would to self mankind prefer? Make mortals happy—if she can, Quite piteous of the sons of men? No; while Philanthropy's extoll'd, And first in Fame's bright lists inroll'd, Lucia the fair must ever prove The parmanent rewards of—Love. FLAVIA. See, Flavia, marriageable grown, And with a fortune of her own, Perhaps, some hundred pounds a-year, Affects no husband but a peer. Transporting thought! to be ally'd To noble blood and—nought beside. A Countess, wealthy, rich, and fair! Death sure a coronet will spare. Flavia this choice discreetly makes, Peers ever are the greatest rakes; And Flavia would do all she can, But to reform such dear, dear men. “To turn, while heedless on he strays, “One from the errour of his ways, “Is like a star, by will divine, “In heaven eternally to shine.” Thus Flavia, with true Christian pride, Would wed with Scripture on her side; Acquire, to live renown'd in story, A coronet, and crown of glory. Kings but one crown, alas! desire, She greatly would to twain aspire. Early-rising and its Opposite compared. For want of something else to do, Some plan of action to pursue, How many doze away their time, Nor think they perpetrate a crime! With bare existence ah! content, Behold their years and lustrums spent! If you no glaring sins commit, Thank not yourselves, but sleep, for it. Stocks too, and stones, might merit claim, Were you here to contend for fame. Howe'er we draw alternate breath, Sleep's but a temporary death. The sleeper then, whoe'er he be, A murderer is in degree; A murderer of what in vain We would recall to life again, Minutes, hours, days, months, years:—alas! Can man more fatally transgress? Murder what, were it rightly us'd, From mean pursuits our passions loos'd, Whether late hir'd, or at eleven Alluding to the celebrated parable in the Gospels., Our service would reward with Heaven! Up, sleeper! then; who knows what hour, God may, omnipotent in pow'r, Make meritorious (no mean prize) Of life immortal, and the skies. If sound in body and in mind, A state which still the temp'rate find, Mankind fallaciously would use The merit ev'n of an excuse. Nature demands but little rest, Howe'er with daily toils opprest; He then that lengthens out repose, Her into much disorder throws; O'er the blunt sense a torpor spreads, Which more than death the wise man dreads; Unfits us to perform our parts, With clear prompt heads, and cheerful hearts; To grace that rank or state, in which Men to be great affect, or rich; Unmans the spirit, born to soar Those heights but Newton soar'd before; Unbraces ev'ry nerve of strength, And quite enfeebles us at length. Your moralists in theory say, “Why should the night encroach on day? “It, sure, looks somehow like a crime, “To live but half our destin'd time; “To sleep, each manly care dismist, “Is not to live, but to exist. “Life at the best is but a span, “Yet that how oft curtail'd by man! “Life's unkind shortness we lament, “Yet make it shorter by consent; “Lose hours, and months, and years, in sleep, “Nor o'er them, like the Roman, weep. “Can man more foolishly behave, “Shortly to slumber in the grave, “Where in dread rueful calm he may “Ages with reptiles doze away, “Till both eternally dissever, “Man rous'd by Fate to wake for ever? “How worse than madmen we behave, “Daily our bed to make our grave! “Nor in this view alone we err, “While sleeping we to life prefer. “Time's a vast loan to mortals lent, “Which but discreetly should be spent; “Good works the int'rest Heav'n demands, “A wakeful eye and active hands: “He then that slumbers time away, “Refuses his arrears to pay; “(Arrears that, with just rigour sought, “Would make poor mortals worse than nought) “He obstinately shuts his eyes, “And wakes a bankrupt to the skies.” How speciously the story told! Reverse the medal, and behold! To rise with the first matin-song, Is life officious to prolong. And what is life, in perfect beauty, A tract of swerving from our duty? Man then by waking nothing wins, But swells his catalogue of sins; Adds deeper crimson to his guilt, And drives the dagger to the hilt: For, soon as wakers we commence, Reason we slight, and live to sense. Besides, no medium we can keep, We must be wicked, or must sleep. Soon as Sleep's opiate leaves his eyes, M?s?n's A noted money-broker in E?; hard, miserable, and wretched to the last degree; whose trade consists in taking the basest and most cruel advantage of peoples distresses and difficulties. astir to gain the prize, The prize, which orphans' tears bedew, Circled with wreaths of deadly yew; Where baneful plants and herbs arise, And the pale wither'd laurel dies; Which Satan, while base Lucre twines, For his much honour'd brow designs, (What earthly master so caressing?) The prize of pinching and distressing. Around him misers still we trace, A bachelor, detested race, Whom gold makes impotent, by it For Earth, as well as Heav'n, unfit. Yet better, from chaste love of pelf, One sordid wretch should starve himself, Than likewise with vile, curs'd pretence, Starve others in a double sense. Conclusion to the Satires. Thus has a bold satiric Muse, Ev'n in the face of three Reviews, Beneath Hope's trusty helmet stout, Into the wide, wide world launch'd out. Ye Critics, use a stranger well, Mind what the patriarch erst befel. Barely to give a bard his due, Though just, is hardly courteous too. Yet, fairly if adjudg'd to fall, You punish him, but favour all; For all the sentence will sustain, By which pronounc'd the Public gain. Whether you censure then, or praise, Him you oblige two sev'ral ways; His praises on mankind reflect, Censure on him's to all respect. Go forth then, bold undaunted page, Stuff'd with the follies of the age, (Perhaps the greatest folly thou) Eternal war with whim to vow, And Dulness, in whatever shape She genius would absurdly ape. Haply, to pour revenge on thee, All ranks thy mortal foes shall be, Enrag'd to see their foibles lash'd, Thou in the fire with fury dash'd; Beneath ingloriously to lie Some mighty volume of a pye; Eternally to sleep in dust, As many a brother-author must; Dispatch'd, from vile tobacco-shops, (O foul disgrace!) to beaus and fops; Dispatch'd to?but, O Silence, come, Command Conjecture to be dumb. Yet martyrs to the truth shall claim Tiaras of immortal fame. Though but a motley piece at best, Made up of dry discourse, and jest, Somewhat obscure, from names unknown, A veil o'er all industrious thrown, Unless where the indignant Muse Greatly disdain'd a mask to use; Yet, names apart, you, now and then, May hint a useful truth to men; While Rubbadash, in love with strife, Falsely arraigns his virtuous wife; Absurdly thinks from others flow'd Those blessings Heav'n on him bestow'd, Though all mankind agree, quam verum Quod ille est origo rerum. But Virtue ne'er could worsted be, Heav'n interpos'd and set her free. What! trembling thus?—Reviewers threat Me with no clemency to treat. For shame!—their stated works survey, You lash pert Dulness, so do they. Pursuing thus commutual ends, You doubtless must be mutual friends. Hence be encourag'd—up—begone, With all your resolution on. But they (mistakes befal the wise) May call me Dulness in disguise; Or, fond of Butler's numbers, scorn His ape, without his genius, born. Then acquiesce, and kiss the rod, Nor falsely call such treatment odd. If dull yourself, you dulness lash, (As billows empty billows dash) Myself will not ward off each thwack Justly inflicted on your back. But though you should escape Reviewers, Behold still troops of fierce pursuers. From lions your retreat you make, But serpents lurk in ev'ry brake. Yet Genius, through the deathless page, Shall shine like suns through ev'ry age; Dulness, illum'd from meteor-light, Sink deep in everlasting night. Who once can Nature's order stay, Make noonday night, or midnight day? But now our satire's just enough, With pick-tooth, pipe, and pinch of snuff, And endless arts to keep awake, The critic's evening task to make. Still to protract our song, would steep His senses all in downright sleep. Then might his hands forget to gripe His snuff-box, or his reeking pipe; And thus some much-deplor'd mishap Befal his waistcoat, or his lap; Adown the adust powder spilt, On sleeve, lapel, and button gilt; Or on the floor, ere sight return'd, Might fall the kindled leaf half-burn'd, The carpet catching quick the flame, That carpet which from Turky came. But lest we should commit a deed, Which would make ev'ry heart to bleed, We now shall stop in happy time, And, saving critics, save our rhyme. Save us then too, friends to each other, As one good deed deserves another. Far milder pictures of the age The critic shall anon engage; Such objects as no mortal fears, The Muse and Elegy in tears. ELEGIES. Quid brevi fortes jaculamur ævo Multa? ? Hor. AN ELEGY ON THE Cutting down of an Oak. In Three Parts. —Lignator agrestis ? ? Nemorisne sacri vastabit honores, Facundam violans umbram ? Nempe focum ut cumulet pretioso robore vilem? Anon. PART I. Now pale Aurora, after long delay From eastern climes to usher in the day, On Night's dark face reflects a transient glance, Which scarce perceiv'd spreads through the murk expanse; Till, from the dewy radiance of her eyes, Another ray, and yet another, flies. These gradual, from the same effulgent store, Succeeded still to infinite by more; Till all the air, unbounded to the sight, Seems one continu'd stream of orient light. Meantime, the forest dun, and mountain blue, Rise in uncouth magnificence to view; The city next, the villa, cottage, fold, And landscape, far as eye can well behold; The cottage, villa, forest, landscape wide, Stript by the rig'rous North of all their pride. No jocund call of music loving Spring As yet invites the feather'd tribe to sing. Winter his frown delights still to assume, Wrapt dreary round in congregated gloom. A sullen stillness universal reigns, And hushes all the mirth-abandon'd plains. A lifeless torpor, centre-felt, invades The woods and groves, unconscious of their shades. With ev'ry blast unusual coldness chills, And deep-form'd mists invest the naked hills. On a fine eminence, of slow ascent, The landscape round stretch'd to a vast extent; An ancient Oak its infant juices drew, And to full majesty of stature grew. Of bulk immense crouds yearly flock'd to see In leafy pomp the celebrated tree; Charm'd to contemplate Nature's giant-son, Fed by the genial seasons as they run. Some tell of elves, and fairy people, seen Here dancing round their little-bodied queen, In antic measures and vagaries light, While conscious shines the kindred orb of night; Of rites perform'd, with odd romantic signs, Mysterious circles, and fantastic lines: Others, of voices heard, and accents strange, Confus'dly mix'd in busy interchange, Still render'd stranger by invention's pow'r, Assisted by the silent, solemn hour. How proud its summits mount into the sky, As if the rage of tempests to defy! The circuit of its branchy arms how wide, In leafless pomp diffus'd on ev'ry side, Which now thrice thirty summer-suns have seen, O'erspread luxuriant with returning green! Vain ostentation! unavailing state! Which serve but to accelerate its fate! The hind, unconscious, from his hostile stand, Whirls round the guilty hatchet in his hand, Anon to strike the unrelenting blow, The trunk that severs from its root below. So, when his stern commission Death receives, When hope itself the sick man's pillow leaves; In vain would Fortune her first offers make, No bribe the king of terrours deigns to take. The pomp of palaces, the glare of state, And all the proud regalia of the great, May add distinction to Death's gloomy hour, But not prevent the triumph of his power: His dart once pointed, must unerring fly, One victim perish, or a thousand die. As to the prize, his arrows love the dark, To him alike the mean and noble mark, The lowly cottage, and the lordly dome, Which kings or simple peasants make their home. Now all about the previous circlet made, Through its firm vitals cuts the keen-edg'd blade; Or in its side, drawn by alternate toil, The sharp-tooth'd saw sinks deep with slight recoil. A thousand echoes, from their slumbers woke, Lend their reluctant ears to ev'ry stroke; And mix their voices sad, to tell around The woods, what means each unaccustom'd sound. The woods throughout return the loud uproar, By rocks and hills repeated o'er and o'er, While all abrupt afford it ampler swell, Struck from each cliff, and shook in every dell. Each woodland youth the din confus'd enjoys, And with redoubled pith his axe employs. Inhuman wretch!—but why this hated name? Let those receive who justly merit blame— The plexus spun so admirably fine, The net-work pipes, and tubes in artful twine, Through which Earth's vegetative fluids glide, By heat fermented to a living tide; The strongly-woven tunics wrapt about, And exquisite contexture form'd throughout; These hid from common observation lie, Nor court the wonder of the vulgar eye. Few daring minds are born sublime to range Yon argent fields, where orbs successive change; On ev'ry planet's fiery axle hurl'd, To make the tour of the celestial world: Few chosen spirits form'd divine to know The secret wonders of our earth below; Surpassing wonders, wisdom's nicer work, That through the vegetable kingdom lurk! Next, to the lofty stems the cordage fix'd, The lofty stems with clouds aspiring mix'd, To try what strength still unsubdu'd remains, What vigour swells its yet unmangled veins, Convuls'd throughout, it totters on its base, Reluctant to forsake its native place, That airy station it enjoy'd so long, A kind asylum to the feather'd throng, Where ever their Vertumnal strains began, Safe in its bosom from the grasp of man! Where oft beneath its mantle hung of green, From noon's intrusive glance a present screen, The shepherd wander'd with his fleecy care, To breathe the cooly fragrance of the air! Softly to warble, on sylvestran reed, While round his lambs, as if attentive, feed, Such simple notes as rural love inspires, The blooming lass his witless heart admires; Perhaps, in some close shelter out of sight, By her regarded with a fond delight. But what avails this fond indulg'd delay? Can it the rage of furious axes stay? Alas! expectant of its speedy doom, The frighted birds depart with undress'd plume. The cattle fly ingrate the luckless spot, Their former stated haunts at noon forgot. Men too predictive prudently withdraw, Waiting the final stroke with silent awe. What then remains, abandon'd thus by all, But a mark'd victim in despair to fall? Thus on the man, beneath misfortune's frown, The supercilious eye looks meanly down, That once (so Fortune's changing wheel requires) Sparkled with Adulation's partial fires. Amid the sunshine of a monarch's smile, While slaves approach'd his seat with fulsome style, How did each sycophant dance in his train, Of but a look's unguarded wafture vain! With what respectful air each dangler trips! What smooth-form'd speeches flutter on his lips! How shines each Proteus-feature with esteem! What he is not the labour great to seem! But lo! the tide of royal favour ebbs, A passing breath breaks Grandeur's court-spun webs; Where now the venal tribe, the courteous race? Gone to the levee of the next—in place. With frequent look the workman lifts his eye, Long anxious the declining top to spy; Nor is his worn-out patience further tried, The feeble structure seems to lean aside. From the pent clouds a sudden gust descends, And full among the boughs its fury spends; Weak and more weak the wounded fabric grows, Strong pulls the rope, and blows succeed on blows: The shock conjoin'd unable to sustain, It stoops, it groans, it thunders to the plain; A cumb'rous ruin wide extended lies, Thrown from the middle region of the skies. But shall the conscious muse unmov'd remain, Nor mourn its fate in elegiac strain? To verse still consecrated trees have stood, And oaks are styl'd the monarchs of the wood. Let then in pity her sad numbers flow, And heave her bosom with ingenuous wo. Late trembling she essay'd the Dorian lyre Alluding to Vertumnus; or, The Progress of Spring., By Thomson erst wak'd to unusual fire; With trembling pencil, caught on Fancy's wing, Sketch'd an imperfect landscape of the Spring. Delightful task! to mark the new-blown flow'r, The fragrant herb, and plant of healing pow'r; The shoot of forward growth, and turgid stem, Sparkling with dew conglob'd in many a gem; Prolific clouds in kindly rain dissolv'd, Soft months return'd, and genial suns revolv'd! Delightful task! with curious eye to trace Each change progressive on Creation's face; In numbers art to make like nature look, To imitate the murmur of the brook; The love-sigh wafted through the green alcove, The zephyr's plaint, and warble of the grove! Delightful task! attentive to survey Winter as he from earth directs his way; To see him all his icy chains unloose, And lessen his impetuous rains to dews; To hear his storms, still'd their sonorous roar, Sink to the breeze that pants along the shore; To see gay Spring, invok'd long to appear, Succeed the gloomy tyrant of the year; Beauty and Youth her handmaids from the sky, Health in their look, and radiance in their eye: While sun-warm'd gales shed odours from their wings, And ev'ry thicket, clad in verdure, sings. Ah! now, a sad reverse her strain demands, Not plenty lavish'd with unsparing hands, Not Beauty's touches exquisitely just, But her first glory levell'd with the dust! This is a subject unessay'd before, Catastrophes far other we deplore; Things animate alone engage our sigh, Or draw the tear impassion'd to our eye. Yet shall the Muse a rule establish'd break, And boldly teach Creation dumb to speak; Converse with Nature's silent offsprings round, And tread, though cautious, on forbidden ground. Nor rashly blame, upon a slight review, Uncommon things seem censurable too. O! could I boast his more than mortal art, To touch the noblest springs that move the heart; Finely instruction with delight to mix, Convince the judgment, and the fancy fix; Who bade, though dead some thousand years before, Mæonides revive on Albion's shore, Mæonides, whate'er fam'd test we seek, Not less renown'd a Briton, than a Greek! Or could I soar, like his rapt muse sublime, Unfetter'd by the stiff restraints of rhyme, Who, with the swell of music on his tongue, The Pleasures of Imagination sung; And while he sings, displays her finest pow'rs, Which, tracing out, we wish devoutly ours; Virtue's own feelings to our sense conveys, His polish'd diction but his second praise! Of Virtue too I sing, Celestial Pow'r, That still befriends us in the pressing hour! Fir'd by whose beauty, and beneath whose smile, Would I my thoughts improve, correct my style. He merits fame, who writes on Virtue's plan, The friend of Virtue, is the friend of man. O Virtue! source of chaste refin'd desire, Thee when I cease to honour and admire; Cease, though in poor endeavours, to practise Thy laws, and recommend them to the wise, Or, when with doubts perplex'd, from Reason stray'd, Cease to implore thy guidance and thy aid; May my ungrateful heart forget to throb, And life end in one agonizing sob! Shall that vain thankless being be prolong'd, By whose existence Thou art basely wrong'd? —But let the elegiac strain begin, At least the prize of meaning well to win. Had the dire axe, O much lamented Oak! That gave thy aged form the mortal stroke, Remain'd yet unattemper'd in the mine, Unwhetted for so cruel a design; Far other scenes the Muses now had sung, To sadness the according lyre unstrung: Of Nature, form'd in all her works alike To fix the judgment, and the fancy strike; Of Merit, plac'd in infinite degrees, Such as the eye by Truth's fair optics sees; Of Friendship, manly, gen'rous, and refin'd, The gentle inmate of the noble mind; Of Beauty, heighten'd by the blushing charm Of Modesty, which tyrants must disarm; Of Fame, dispensing to her votive croud The laurel crown, with sound of clarions loud. But though a mangled carcase on the ground, Thy honours scatter'd in disgrace around; Immortal shalt thou live, renown'd in song, If to the verse immortal can belong— For here the Muse would intermit her grief, A glorious scene supplies a kind relief. To Britain sacred be the patriot strain, And who in Britain's ear would dare complain? By thee supported, O imperial tree, Through ev'ry age invincible by thee, Albion the fam'd, the great, the mighty, reigns Unrivall'd empress of the watery plains; In floating bulwarks, Freedom's flag unfurl'd, Points the wing'd thunder, and o'erawes a world. Hence to her sceptre kings shall subject be, And haughty tyrants bend on suppliant knee. Hence shall her empire through the earth extend, And only with time's latest period end. O! let Britannia still her oak revere, Her chief defence should claim her chiefest care. The naval pillar that her throne supports, Her wave-built castles, her breeze-wafted forts; Her magazines of death, with canvas wings, Should still to Britons be momentous things. While other nations lie expos'd a prey To tyrants bent on universal sway; Nature bestow'd, rais'd at her own expense, To Britons wooden walls for their defence. Let Britons then within these walls reside, Their strength combin'd no factions to divide; Defend with valour, guard with watchful eye, As if an angel, beck'ning each, stood by; Valour with unanimity, that boast The noblest deeds, where dangers threat the most. Britannia, long superiour to decline, May with her oak her diadem resign; As heroes by some vulgar shaft may die, When, too secure, their armour they lay by; Fate wills them on each other to depend, As one at first, to meet one common end. Illustrious tree! what honours on thee wait, The sov'reign's safety, and a kingdom's fate; That glory which prosperity attends, Which age to age, increasing still, extends! As thou art timely summon'd to our aid, Fame's circling laurels bloom afresh, or fade; The gem in Albion's crown looks doubly bright, Or foully tarnish'd to the Patriot's sight Once too, within thy hospitable trunk, Faint thro' fatigue, and with misfortunes sunk, A monarch rested, friendless and alone, A solitary exile from his throne. A kind retreat thy loyal arms supply, Where injur'd Majesty secure may lie; Hither no traitor foe his step directs, No hostile eye the royal shade suspects. Ye monarchs, hear! ye scepter'd sons of pride, Who haughtily Europa's states divide! Be the vain competition heard no more, Your lordly claims, your boasted triumphs o'er, Whose shall the empire of the ocean be, Bestow'd on Albion, by divine decree. And justly too the diadem she craves, Who dwells, her native clime, amid the waves; Guarded by rocks projecting o'er the deep, Banks inaccessible, and mountains steep; Tremendous bulwarks rear'd by Nature's hand, Against Ambition's proud assaults to stand; To check each tyrant's insolent approach, Who would on Freedom's darling spot encroach; A spot mark'd out by Heav'n's approving eye, To share the choicest blessings of the sky; Albion the just, whom Fate below employs, To keep the interests of a world in poise; No diminution e'er her power to know, Till oaks themselves in forests cease to grow. Thus on thy fame the Muse would fondly dwell, Thus would thy praise in faithful numbers tell; Thy praise, that must descend through ev'ry age, While British deeds adorn the lib'ral page. But ah! how short the respite now enjoy'd! The plaintive lyre must be again employ'd At sight of thee thrown headlong on the plain, Pity renew'd demands the mournful strain. For, whether youthful in Vertumnal bloom, Wisdom solac'd beneath thy solemn gloom; Or stretch'd the earth, a rootless trunk, along, Still art thou form'd alike to live in song. Thus he, deep learn'd in Virtue's sacred lore, Who practises her precepts o'er and o'er; Whose bright example daily shows mankind, How near perfection brought the human mind; Alive or dead, with equal merit draws, Claims our esteem, and rivets our applause; For though depriv'd of temporary breath, He speaks in silence, and he lives in death. No more shall Spring thy torpid roots revive, Pervious thy tubes, thy dormant sap alive. No more expand thy cold-contracted pores, Pointing the ray thy freshness that restores. No more shall moisture through thy bark transude, Or summer-heats thy infant stems protrude. No more soft foliage mantle thee around, To cast refreshing shadows on the ground. No more the bees thy close recesses haunt, With honey homeward bound for future want. No Zephyr flutter through thy umbrage dun, To cool the fervours of the noontide sun. Music no more attentive nature charms, From the hid centre of thy circling arms, While Echo, mindful of the list'ning swain, Repeats the dying cadence of each strain. No more the rook, returning home, shall see Far off her airy build aloft on thee, Lin'd warm within from incommoding air, A fit example of parental care; No more her down-cloth'd young with rapture view, Agape for food, her labours to renew; Now, taught their nests instinctive to forsake, Around its edge the offer'd morsel take; Now hopping, half afraid, from spray to spray, Ere through mid-air they dauntless wing their way. Pattern to man, ere launch'd out any length In bold designs, to estimate his strength. Nor let it pique his pride, that tow'rs aloft, To learn from instinct, though despis'd so oft. Instinct, howe'er fam'd moralists define, Is reason, but a little less divine, More circumscrib'd, or languid in its power, Though not less steady in the trying hour. For travel its dominion, you will find, It differs in degree, but not in kind; As stars, of various distance through the skies, Or diamonds, not in water, but in size. Descend then, man, from insolence and scorn, Reason, your boast, is but the elder born; One common parent both respective claim, Alike in nature, though distinct in name; For though vain man so arrogantly wise, Instinct itself may reason oft advise. Nor instinct only, trees may silence break, And to mankind's confusion learn to speak. Trees represent the characters of men, Beyond the vulgar daubings of the pen. Spread out in full luxuriancy of shade, Which vainly storms and hurricanes invade, We in the oak's strong lineaments behold The brave, unshaken, masculine, and bold. The flexile, wav'ring, and enervate heart, Subject at ev'ry accident to start, At trifles scar'd, as at death's final stroke, Boast no resemblance to the manly oak. When the warm sun advances in his signs, And with invigorating radiance shines; When nipping frosts and blasting winds are gone, Last of the grove his raiment he puts on; Or when the lord of day his heat withdraws, And seasons change by universal laws; Last of the forest too, with decent pride, His robes of shining green he lays aside. Thus he, the rational consistent man, Who acts on Virtue's fair and steady plan, Feels no abrupt elation in his mind, When Fortune, fickle favourite, is kind; Nor mean depression, though her wheel cast up Some evil to embitter life's sad cup. Some men, quite soft and feminine in make, At common things prophetically quake. If but disease attacks his neighbour's fold, Or on his barns the casual flame takes hold; If an eclipse (foretold) the welkin shrouds, Or thunders burst from agitated clouds; If but a meteor shoots across the sky, Or some untimely funeral passes by: His mind with omens and forebodings swells, And ev'ry look his superstition tells. Such in the Oak no pleasing likeness find, Foes to themselves, nor friends to humankind. PART II. The grandee from his palace casts his eye, To view his noble group of objects nigh; The time-rent ruin, with huge turrets fac'd, The temple on some elevation plac'd; The woody lab'rinth planted without bound, The costly buildings scatter'd all around; From smoke the city rising by degrees, The hamlet shaded by surrounding trees; The lofty bridge, whose arches proudly rise, The distant ocean mixing with the skies; The round fir clump, cloth'd in perennial green, The cloud-topt mountain, through perspective seen; The gilded steeple far-remote beheld, The river in broad sheets of water swell'd; —The well-known oak—but ah! no oak appears, Beneath the load of venerable years— “What! gone?—impossible!”—amaz'd he cries, “Sure some unusual languor dims mine eyes; “Say not, admir'd but some few hours before, “The beauty of the landscape is no more.” Again, he looks incredulous to all, Too soon convinc'd of thy untimely fall, A solitary prospect only left, Of every wonted ornament bereft. He shuts his window with indignant haste, Disgusted at man's poverty of taste; Whose narrow views still point at sordid pelf, Of mankind fond, but fonder of himself. Around this amply-branching shade, how oft With bended neck, or proud head toss'd aloft, Has the young steed, of gen'rous birth, regal'd On succulent repasts that never fail'd? From hence led forth, obedient to the sign, To form in rich caparison the line; Unmov'd from stern disdain and martial pride, Though cohorns burst in thunder at his side; The coronet-adorn'd machine to grace, With lordly port and art-conducted pace; To run the stated course's crouded round, Scarce left a foot-track loit'ring on the ground; Or stretch, o'er yonder heath's unmeasur'd space, Each swelling muscle in the jovial chace, While hopes of triumph strange delight impart, And with big tumults heave his bounding heart. But let the muse describe, with grateful strain, The noblest animal that feeds the plain. How his brac'd nervous sinews swell with strength! How graceful in his shape, his height, his length! How elegantly careless flows his mane! How sweeps his tail luxuriant on the plain! How smooth the glossy polish of his skin! How prompt each various gait he wantons in! How vigour his broad turgid chest expands! How swiftly he careers! how firm he stands! His ears how exquisitely pair'd alike! How equally his limbs in motion strike! How from his nostrils, in successive wreaths, Efflux of life, the fire ethereal breathes! Beyond whate'er resemblance can imply, How bright the vital fluid of each eye! How airy, how vivacious, how alert, His fearless spirit, and unconquer'd heart! Ah! now, around the well-remember'd tree, No more to frisk, from the rude snaffle free! No more, with heat and food luxurious cloy'd, Prefer its shade to suns and meads enjoy'd! Where shall the reapers now their revels hold, With passions all of one attemper'd mold; No more, each with his smirking, red-cheek'd maid, To feast beneath this hospitable shade; Where, gather'd in the produce of the soil, They erst relax'd themselves from annual toil; Where peals sonorous of broad laughter rung, Each told his tale, and each his sonnet sung; Where inoffensive jokes ran quick as thought From mouth to mouth, as by infection caught; Where copious draughts dissolv'd each heart in mirth And gave a thousand pleasing frolics birth: Where shall the reapers now, at noon, resort, To share returns of such unenvy'd sport? Round Celadon, the universal friend Of all that once to merit could pretend, (If we may here, licens'd by critic's law, From things inanimate resemblance draw) The social circle thus were wont to sit, Charm'd with his manly eloquence and wit; To hear him, not like learning's pedant tribe, Virtue in her own native form describe, Which ravishes the more, the nearer seen, No veil scholastic, no disguise between. With what a graceful ease his language flow'd, Which not by starts, but uniformly glow'd! A nicety those never can practise, In pomp of words whose only merit lies. Now all the senses seem an eye ingross'd, Now in an ear with equal wonder lost. His style by study haply might be caught, But not his simple elegance of thought. There he excell'd, unrival'd and alone, With fancy, manner, sense, and taste, his own. He scorn'd that formal disingenuous part, To point out virtues strangers to his heart. On those that grac'd his life he only dwelt, And ev'ry sentiment he painted, felt. Each fine emotion he judg'd friendship by, Smil'd in his cheek, or sparkled in his eye. He that a name for virtue would acquire, Must do far more than merely to admire. Fools may admire, but none, except the wise, Know where the duty, or the merit lies; And knowing, with refinement shar'd by few, Perform the one and claim the other too. He that loves Virtue, for pure Virtue's sake, Would her prefer, though crowns themselves at stake. Such more respect by one good action pays, Than who compiles a volume in her praise. To think, and act well, are two distinct things, That oft from pride, this but from wisdom springs. A man, by thinking, oft becomes a fool, With all the boasted learning of the school; While he whose thoughts but the bare surface skim, Is justly styl'd a Socrates to him. Virtue resides not in the head, but heart, The man of theory loves her but in part, Or loves, as men love courtiers, for their place, As on his ethics she confers a grace. Not for herself does she his value win, But for the garb his pride arrays her in. In the profound of thought he loves to sink, And pities those that tarry on the brink, He dives for treasure, but his depth exceeds, And finds himself involv'd in mire and weeds; While he, who only walks along the shore, A diamond spies, or meets with golden ore. The man, whose life's a transcript of his heart; Acts both a selfish, and a gen'rous part; Above the bait of honour and of pelf, He cheats no mortal, nor deceives himself. Such Celadon, the gentle and the kind, His morals faultless, as his taste refin'd. Him no false lights, no empty theories led From Virtue's fane, from Wisdom's fountain-head. By truth's unerring optics still he view'd The path of life, and viewing it, pursu'd. But Celadon, though thus admir'd by all, Got to his native skies an early call. Merit, or virtue of sublime degree, Men are below permitted but to see, Not claim, as property transferr'd to them Like the rich spotted fur, or costly gem. So, in the compass of a thousand years, The comet, glorious stranger, just appears, Then, on his journey, worlds regret his stay, Through depths of ether sweeps his dazzling way. Blessings and talents, of superiour kind, Seldom for long duration seem design'd; Angels to such their fond pretensions make, With mortals here ambitious to partake. Ah! how unequal, whatsoe'er the prize, The rival claim between the eath and skies! Hence Celadon, few thus resign their breath, Was snatch'd by sudden, not unwelcome death; Snatch'd to those regions of eternal day, Where worth and virtue bloom without decay. At noon he heard the summons, and obey'd, Without one murmur, ere the evening-shade; More hasty not the unexpected blow That laid this Oak's umbrageous honours low. No more shall punctual lovers here repair, The faithful shepherd, nor unconscious fair, To interchange each other's soft desires, In accents such as purest love inspires; To form their tender wishes in a sigh, To speak the melting language of the eye; Or sweetly, in alternate measures, sing That mutual passion whence their transports spring: While May's gay songsters, with unwearied throats, Warble their finely-modulated notes; While gales in scarce-heard whispers fan them round, Breathing the odours of the flowery ground, And every moment with unusual speed, As envious, seems its fellow to succeed. Hail Love! whose subtile essence can pervade The deepest solitude and thickest shade; Like lightning with ethereal swiftness dart Through the recesses of the human heart, Each appetite to thy subjection bring, Guide Life's chief movements, touch its every spring! Nor only, in the summer of our days, Thy active magic its effects displays, When Youth's keen wishes sparkle in the eye, And with wild throbs the conscious pulse beats high. Our Winter owns thy vivifying ray, When worn-out Nature feels a quick decay. The frozen current, stagnate in our veins, A new-excited undulation gains; Life's half-spent lamp renews its languid fires, And strange delight each feeble sense inspires. But for that gentle charm deriv'd from thee, What perfect savages would mortals be? Less tame than yonder tenants of the wild, For beasts themselves by thee are render'd mild; The lion fierce stills his appalling roar, And wolves forget to stain their jaws with gore. Oh! may my bosom still thy transports know, There may thy milder ardours ever glow, Free from the torments, nothing can assuage, Of disappointed hope and jealous rage; Free from the dry reserve, the cool disgust, And guilty tumults of licentious lust. So shall the same kind venerable tree Of seeming opposites productive be That lambent flame, which it provok'd before, Now happily refrain, to rise no more. Thus the same ray, that scorches up the plains, Cools the thin juices in the melon's veins. The same kind lunar orb, with occult powers, Directs the ebbing and the flowing hours. Ah! hapless tree! each circling season spent, How many will thy absent shades lament; Kind refuge to the apprehensive swain, When thunder-clouds dissolv'd in hasty rain! So, when some gen'rous guardian of mankind, Deceas'd, leaves weeping half the world behind; Our thoughts no other subject can ingross, We speak but to deplore the general loss. Time, place, and circumstance, recall to mind His presence, with officiousness unkind. Who now like him, benevolent to all, A friend, a guardian, at soft pity's call, To screen Misfortune in whatever form, As once this tree a covert from the storm? As it the foremost beauty of its kind, So he the glory of his race design'd. The youthful shepherd pensive and forlorn, Long tyrant Love's unworthy shackles worn, Henceforth no more, with ready hand, shall mark The dear initials on thy tender bark; The dear initials of his charmer's name, Ah! unaffected by a mutual flame! Happy, each early morn, or closing eve, To read the well-known characters, and grieve; With all his passions melting in his eyes, The only comfort his hard lot supplies. No more the sprightly circle shall be seen Beneath thy shady canopy of green; Pleas'd to run through, with intermingled glance, The mazy evolutions of the dance; While graceful every limb obsequious moves, As each with self-applauding smile approves; Pleas'd to detect, what each would fondly hide, From arch reserve, or bashful maiden pride. Pleas'd their flush'd charms should have this twain effect, All to behold, not one the art suspect. How fresh, how virid look'd thy pensile gloom! Amongst thy boughs how zephyrs breath'd perfume! No more in leafy pomp to wave above, The youthful sports of innocence and love! What mighty revolutions hast thou seen, Thy shoot of infancy and fall between, While monarchs to inexorable death, Resign'd at once their sceptre and their breath; Others advanc'd successive in their room, Victims ere long to the same common doom. What changes from unapprehended springs, What unexpected turns of human things, While millions of the blust'ring sons of Pride, That seem'd the world by suffrage to divide, Strutted with rude insulting air a while, Then dropt forgot, amid ev'n Fortune's smile? So insects sport in yonder noontide ray, Swept by the first inclement blast away. So painted mushrooms rise with morning-light, And disappear ere the approach of night. So bubbles on the pool, beneath a show'r, Vanish and swell, ten thousand in an hour. But now with them thy triumph's likewise o'er, To mark time's strange vicissitudes no more. To mark the labours of vain plodding man, The sons to finish what their fires began; To mark those deep designs late time unfolds, That daily conflict Vice with Virtue holds, Though from the field compell'd oft to remove, Virtue, at last, sole conqueror to prove. Such the reflections, at the Muse's call, That shall, auspicious tree, attend thy fall; Such moral hints hence in gradation rise, As school-bred Learning may not blush to prize. But ah! no swain henceforward shall behold Thy early summits ting'd with liquid gold, Propitious sign that, to expecting eyes, The lord of day will visit soon the skies: Or when the moon, pale majesty of night, Effusive spreads abroad her sacred light, No late-returning hind shall see display'd In waving silver thy expansive shade; Kind hint, no longer on vain cares to roam, But hasten to his wishing consort home. Thus he whom true philosophy styles wise, A rational expectant of the skies; Who walks in Virtue's consecrated ways, Amid the sunshine of his Maker's praise; Who earth contemns, and as immortal lives, Though nearer death each round the dial gives; Such shines a living proof, some ages past, No longer this uncertain state shall last; This state of anarchy, of guilt and doubt, Where wrapt in night poor mortals grope about, Grope round for happiness, but never trace, Or grasp a lifeless phantom in her place; Each scene from errour and confusion freed, Eternal day unclouded shall succeed: Why Virtue, else, unworthily distress'd, Worn out with trouble, and with grief oppress'd? Why still successful and triumphant Vice, Her very smiles esteem'd at Virtue's price? To each a friendly warning, to forsake That course commenc'd from folly or mistake; From laws of moral force misunderstood, From false conceptions of the only good; From voluntary sloth, to guilt akin, From loose abandon'd principles within; From prepossession, caprice, or from pride, That all alike the footsteps turn aside: By such a noble effort of the mind, His nature's highest happiness to find; His wishes bounded by time's narrow span, To rise an angel, though inhum'd a man. But did we here that happiness define, Which best deserves the epithet, divine; For which mankind ten thousand projects try, Contented live, and almost bear to die; Not at the Cynic's threshold should we stumble, But call it, in plain language, being humble. Let empty sophists various styles bestow, This one word names all happiness below. Here let the judgment rest, conjecture cease, And here be ev'ry passion lull'd to peace. With confidence let man depend alone Upon himself, and trust his bliss to none. This reason dictates, prudence recommends, Prudence and reason ever mutual friends; This common sense approves, that never looks, For obvious truths, to colleges or books; Convinc'd from Nature's fair and ample page, Not the vain guesses of bewilder'd sage. Some wits, in letters of gigantic size, Who view plain things with scientific eyes, Take mighty pains a needless fact to prove, Because to wrangle such supremely love; And still they learn'dly write, as if we doubted, Till volumes swell, about it and about it. Such are indeed a harmless set of men, That wield, but not offensively, the pen. The injury is to themselves they do, Theirs is the toil, but not the profit too; Theirs many a restless night, and anxious day, No laurel crown their service to repay, For few buy works, conceit with trifling mix'd, To fix a faith, that never was unfix'd. PART III. Thus truths, not unimportant to the wise, From unsuspected sources may arise. On the bare lonely strand, or rocky height, A costly diamond oft arrests the sight; On mountains wild, or desert-tracts below, Herbs of inestimable virtues grow. Let none pronounce the subject barren then, Trees may be taught sometimes to lecture men; The vegetable world those thoughts inspire That love from poring sages to retire; Deride the vaunted knowledge of the age, Learn'd from conceit, not Nature's sacred page. These, taught in some sublime didactic lay, Might mend our manners by the surest way; Force our tumultuous passions to subside, And humble the aspiring brow of pride. But though enrich'd by these, still in the gross Our profit's nearly balanc'd by the loss. No more the youth, by love of science smit, Shall under thy leaf-wove umbrella sit; Charm'd with the wide diffusion of thy sprays, Impervious to the noontide-pointed rays; No care-form'd wrinkles on his brow imprest, That mark the anxious thoughts estrang'd to rest; That mark the inward bias disinclin'd To study, and the pursuits of the mind; Those objects that assimilate the taste To Nature's standard, ever rightly plac'd; Stamp on the passive heart each soft impress, And bounds prescribe to ev'ry wrong excess; Render the thoughts capacious, to extend Not merely to existence, but the end; Not to a moment's unsubstantial good, But lasting, as by Virtue understood. Distinguish'd thus, the studious youth no more Shall here advance in Wisdom's hallow'd lore. No more consult each deeply-labour'd page, The well-collected knowledge of an age; Where Nature's grand arcanas lie explain'd, Where manners glow depicted as they reign'd; Mark'd all the changes of this lower ball, While in succession empires rise or fall; Kings are dethron'd, or slaves to monarchs rais'd, Those lights extinguish'd that superiour blaz'd; Lights of the church, the cabinet, and field, Immortal names, that only once could yield! Lights, far remov'd from Fame's illustrious strife, That shone in circles of domestic life; Though fainter their restricted radiance glows, These not less glorious to a state than those. No more, with eye elate, and kindled thought, To relish beauties by example taught, Shall he in thy romantic gloom peruse The fine descriptions of the moral muse; Where wit and humour charm with native ease, By stealth surprise us, and by magic please; Where delicately sketch'd each object looks As drawn from living nature, not from books; Where fancy's gay ideal pictures shine, And manly sense inspirits ev'ry line: While taste, as eyes illuminate the face, Throws over all an elegance and grace. In such a shade, still sacred to the Nine, Was wont the Mantuan poet to recline; While Fancy round spread her aëreal wings, Fancy to view that earth's each beauty brings, Howe'er dispers'd, beneath whatever suns, As each soft smiling month its progress runs. To shepherds and their flocks his lute he strung, Of sylvan scenes, of groves, and fountains sung. Taught husbandmen, in highly-polish'd strains, How to improve the culture of their plains; Behold their lusty herds innumerous thrive, And whence Autumnal treasures to derive. In such a shade the Caledonian fam'd Was early by the partial Muses nam'd, To paint the Seasons, that in turns appear, To sing the glories of the circling year. From his fine pen what apt descriptions flow! What finish'd landscapes from his pencil glow! The charms of Nature were but rudely known, Till graceful in his matchless numbers shown: Scarce fairer they our naked eyes attract, Than in his soft embellishments when deck'd. What noble themes the silent gloom inspires, Genius awake with all her kindred fires! What visions prompt the bard ecstatic laid Beneath some full-spread oak's umbrageous shade, Like that the Muse has now essay'd to sing, No more the boast of Culture and of Spring. No more to thee, at Evening's wish'd return, While sacred ardours in her bosom burn, Shall rapt Philosophy her footsteps bend, Intent on man, his origin and end; The glories of his intellectual frame, Transcendent as that Being whence they came; That point him out, his fetters left behind, For Heaven and immortality design'd; His senses, all the wonders of his make, That of a nature less sublime partake; Yet not less necessary, as they tend To one just, sapient, well-adapted end: Why sent below, a moment or an age, To act his part on life's oft-trodden stage; The appetites and passions in his train, With dignity the drama to sustain; With dignity, while Virtue over-rules, And their internal fire excites or cools; Then steal behind the scene from human eyes, The gaze of fools, or wonder of the wise: What renders him with reptiles on a par, Reason to instinct oft inferiour far; Or lifts him in the scale of beings high, Angels his kindred, his retreat the sky, Fain to secure the harbour of the grave, Toss'd to and fro on life's tempestuous wave. Such objects, by thy gloom inspiring caught, No more rush boundless on her crouded thought. No more night's solemn birds, at twilight gloom, Amid thy boughs their doleful notes resume; That give an irksome melancholy joy To whom lone Solitude's still cares employ. Such, musing, as disconsolate deplore A parent, or a consort, ah! no more; Or, with remembrance that surpasses all Distress, a bosom friend's untimely fall! Whose hopes, pursuits, and wishes were the same, Honest alike in mutual praise, or blame; Whose kindred souls bore one impressive stamp, No sordid strife their social joys to damp; To disunite that union, which below None but sublime congenial spirits know. When, on his mid-day throne, the sun displays His centre-felt refulgency of blaze, Attracted by thy moist expanse of shade, No more beneath the poet shall be laid. To celebrate his Maker's glorious praise, Whose consummate design each scene displays, Whether the contemplation-wafted glance Traverses earth, or yonder blue expanse; Whose wisdom, goodness, and resistless pow'r, Shine worthy of the Godhead ev'ry hour; And all for man, fair offspring styl'd his own, His image, the free subject of his throne. No more each season's mild approach to sing, The sheaf-crown'd Autumn, or the flow'r-wreath'd Spring, With all the gay attendants in their train, That jocund trip the cowslip-broider'd plain. No more, if Love's heart-kindled passion warms, Inspir'd by Beauty's fascinating charms, To paint the exquisite sensation felt, Sigh in soft measure, or in numbers melt. Hail gen'rous ardour of the soften'd heart, Which more implies than language can impart; From whose kind impulse rather than be free, We had at once much better cease to be; Relinquish all that mortals good define, Fame's circling laurel, and the golden mine. Henceforth no painter, on some hillock plac'd, Shall view the landscape by thy presence grac'd; In deep-green majesty of foliage drest, On humbler shoots a kind protection cast. No more his pencil guide the glossy ink, Hills here to raise, and valleys there to sink; Transfer thy beauties to his fine-sketch'd view, To wave in miniature, and bloom anew. Uncouth would now appear his objects drawn, Absent thy shades, the glory of the lawn. Thus, to depaint the manners of the times, Diversify'd by virtues and by crimes; Figures in ev'ry attitude beheld, Persons and things, that variously excell'd, Assum'd new faces, acted different parts, Fashions, and humours, policies, and arts; How naked, how impoverish'd would appear The awkward portrait of each busy year, If that fine character which Virtue draws, Stamp'd with a nation's suffrage of applause, Did not within the artist's compass fall, To throw a glow of beauty over all? For he, the good, the wise, the godlike man, Who from a worthy, settled, vigorous plan, Not merely to be popularly great, Promotes the native welfare of a state; He casts a charm o'er the historic page, A lustre that reflects on every age; As once these branches venerable threw A certain grace o'er the surrounding view, Soon as abroad, the softer season past, Forth issues winter's unauspicious blast, The tender shrubs their orphan state bemoan, Deny'd their wonted shelter round them thrown; Deny'd thy genial moisture shed about, When heat unsufferably glows without; When vegetable life seems half destroy'd, No cooling breeze, no lenient show'rs enjoy'd. So mourns the man, with sorrow-streaming eyes, When his much-honour'd benefactor dies; Whose bounty, with no mean restrictions shown, Soften'd his cares scarce sufferable grown; Bade Plenty smile, each pleasing comfort felt, Where Want before emaciated dwelt. Oh! sad reverse! each species of distress Assails him, now, despairing of redress; Save from an equal virtuous calm within, A peaceful conscience unalarm'd by sin. Nor sinks the noble soul beneath his load, On whom such liberal blessings are bestow'd. An accident may him of wealth deprive, But not of hopes immortal, still alive. He ne'er repines for ease enjoy'd erewhile, But turns the frown of fortune to a smile. Man seldom with consistent thought attends, Still on himself how much through life depends, To find that happiness he would attain; Hence his laborious search so often vain. Ten thousand schemes invention fond employs, We range life's circle of phantastic joys; Immerge in cares, to distant climates roam, To seek that treasure, only found at home. Would you be happy, nor oblig'd to pelf? Forsake the croud, and live within yourself. There you a world in miniature will find, Though not exact in bulk, exact in kind; The various passions, bred in Wisdom's school, Or Errour's, that the multitude o'er-rule. From these then disciplin'd your peace derive, Nor other means of happiness contrive. Men take indeed, but rarely men bestow, As rivers to their springs ne'er backward flow. From home-set graftures your contentment shoots, Tho' flourish trees sometimes from borrow'd roots; Not so our sturdy oak, aloft it grew, Nor juices save from native tendrils drew. Each season, as it runs its destin'd race, Passing shall miss thee in thy wonted place; Spring to prepare thy verdant suit, anon Presented thee by Summer to put on; Autumn thy little progeny to bid Cling to each suckling branch, in embryo hid; Winter, attended by his blasts, to throw Around thy naked arms his sheets of snow. The ivy, late thy waist fond clasp'd around, Shall unambitious creep along the ground, Till, in her progress, some majestic tree She haply meets; of tow'ring growth like thee; To tell, if such her happy fortune spies, How low reduc'd, and seek his aid to rise. Thus merit, elevated once on high, Attracting the fond gaze of every eye; When by inextricable causes thrown From that superiour rank where late she shone; (For errour, doubt, and accident involve The noblest purpose, and the best resolve) Passes her days in some sequester'd spot, Despis'd her former grandeur, or forgot; Obscure her home, which trees in friendship hide, Far from the insolent approach of Pride; Perhaps beneath the pressure of distress, Till some reverse of Fortune make it less; Some cast thrown up on her fantastic wheel, Whence mortals half their joys and sorrows feel, Sets her reluctant in her pristine state, Not likely then more happy, though more great. But now the Muse too much protracts her song, To simple themes thoughts simply turn'd belong; And while on such we brevity preserve, Haply from critic's precepts less we swerve. Yet if instruction points the tedious lay, Why not for once uncensur'd disobey? If such strict laws utility condemn, Say, why not decently dissent from them? Unauthoriz'd by use, though pride of schools, What merit boasts a set of formal rules? A clock, with all the workman's finest art, Finish'd in ev'ry nice-adjusted part, Without the pendulum, to make it go, Were but a school-boy's toy, a rareeshow. To touch the heart's more glorious, reason says, Than set to work ten learn'd heads in our praise. That source of tender feeling, friendship, love, Where Life's quick subtile springs concenter'd move, Could but the numbers, with soft impulse, make To melt in sorrow, or to rapture wake; Critics unnoted should dispute the causes, In Learning's court, of syllables and pauses. From thee then, Oak, though long in ruins sunk, A sapless, bare, unanimated trunk, Mankind, with admiration and surprise, To bind my brows, should see the laurel rise. Henceforward, at the soft return of Spring, With frequent chirp, and rapture-quiver'd wing, No birds conven'd shall croud thy naked boughs, To interchange their hymeneal vows; All eager with their fellow-mates to pair, One common fortune through the year to shate; In sweet domestic cares, and scenes of joy, Their task-appointed moments to employ; No cool reserve, no loud contentious strife, To mar the comforts of their quiet life. And shall the feather'd tribe examples prove To those made one by wedlock—not by love? Shall such o'erspread the virgin's cheek with shame, Conscious her words or actions merit blame? Shall sullen frowns becloud that beauteous face, Where we should ever the soft sun-beam trace? Shall wrath distort those features, moulded smooth By Nature's hand, to soften and to soothe? Shall fragrant cherry lips dispart, to show Teeth clos'd with rage in double ivory row? Shall eyes, which meekly radiant should be found, Sparkle with ire, or flash the lightning round? Shall that inchanting tongue o'erflow with gall, Whence honey should alone effusive fall? That dove-like bosom with commotions swell, Where peace, and joy, and hope should only dwell? That graceful presence, that angelic form, Be furious toss'd in passion's self-rais'd storm? With all the gentle virtues in her train, That love to give delight, but never pain; With all the modest ornaments of pride, Nor to expose her beauties, nor to hide; With all her charms of manner, form, and mien, To gain respect, not barely to be seen; Her sweetness, candour, delicacy, ease, And graces inexpressible to please; Woman seems Heaven's first fairest gift to man, The consummation of her Maker's plan. But when fierce passions in her breast engage, With ev'ry burst of agitated rage; Throw into ferment her serener frame, Nor redden once her cheek with conscious shame, (The maid grown bold to run pert Folly's range) What bosom sighs not at the striking change? Now, she appears than mortal somewhat more, And smiles, that we may Indian-like adore; Now, in our wonder something less she seems, While all may pity, but not one esteems. Would female hearts with true ambition glow, Know Nature, and still practise what you know. This will Ardelia's boasted art outvie, And charm beyond the twinkle of an eye; This Livia's cheek with finer red will flush, Than the vain carmine's artificial blush; This will give native grace to Celia's air, And make Aminta something more than fair. To all the charms of person and of face, Interiour sweetness, and external grace; Did but the fair endeavour to excell By thinking justly, whence flows acting well; How would each youth low paltry pelf contemu, Possess'd of more than gold, possess'd of them! This Lucia finds, a pattern to the fair, And this will all who her discretion share. Nor do harsh frowns become his lofty brow Who fond with her partakes the nuptial vow. His temper, less by gentle methods rul'd, Should by reflection be discreetly cool'd. With headstrong passions, Nature gave him too Reason their rage licentious to subdue. Else things inadequate had she bestow'd, And goodness less than wanton malice show'd. Though styl'd the lord of earth, with haughty claim, Of both the just authority's the same; A right to rule he boasts on no pretence, Unless from knowledge or superiour sense; And who would not with promptitude obey, When wisdom or when virtue bears the sway? Hail sacred state! where each a treasure finds, Marriage, thou cement of congenial minds! Hail fate-tied knot, death can alone undo! Hail rite mysterious to make one of two! Pleas'd would the Muse thy mystic charms define, If not digressive from her main design; The gloomy Muse, whom elegy detains In joyless numbers and lugubrious strains. Nor tears alone o'erflow her grief-swoln eyes, When worth deceases, or a Stella dies; An insect crush'd presented to her eye, Can lift her tender bosom to a sigh; The fate untimely of a new-blown flow'r, Or tree luxuriant that was wont to tow'r. Ill-fated Oak! could not thy matchless size, So vast an object to admiring eyes, Thy knotty firmness opportune have sav'd Thy form with such pre-eminence that wav'd? Thou, whose hard sides can forceful balls repel, Brave the rough wintry surge and tempest fell; Support the mighty palace, yet at length Ages to view thee unimpair'd in strength; What shall a hatchet's momentary blow Lay all thy proud display of grandeur low? So have we seen an impious monarch pale, His courage faint, his limbs beneath him fail; Seen his teeth chatter, swim his troubled sight, His looks aghast, his hair on end with fright, His countenance in dumb amazement fall, When he beheld the writing on the wall: The haughty look fled from his princely brow, His meanest slave seems scarce beneath him now. Yet danger he could face, superiour far, And plunge amid the thickest storms of war; Without a shrink see Death tremendous slay His thousands and ten thousands in a day; The spear extended to destroy oppose, And meet the arrow pointed by his foes. But through his vitals dire dismay now reigns, A gelid torpor creeps along his veins; Though spirit erst through all his actions ran, Now he appears an object less than man. Whate'er the previous trials that befall, Death, in approach, is terrible to all. With great or less dismay his arrows strike, Haply the dread but in degree unlike. Nature recoils at the severe decree, Howe'er incurr'd, by which we cease to be; The brain thought and sensation to convey, The lungs to vibrate, and the heart to play. How startled vitious minds with shrouds and urns! Death the vain boaster to a coward turns. The impulse of an agitated vein, Supply'd with sudden transports from the brain; The start of vengeance, or the flash of ire, May temporary courage oft inspire; When danger lessens to the blinded eye, And the impassive soul could bear to die: But let the temper's partial warmth abate, And coolly gain its ordinary state; Let the swoln passion's ebulitions sink, Give leisure to remonstrate, time to think; Let Silence seem to listen with dread awe, And Darkness round her midnight curtain draw: Let Virtue her affronted rights assert, And conscious guilt sting his detected heart; How like a poltroon looks the hero fam'd, His manhood vanish'd, his proud spirit tam'd! Valour, that no mean diminution knows, Whate'er camps boast, alone from Virtue flows; Fix'd, unappal'd, beneath habitual rule, Ardent as noon, yet as the twilight cool; Which instant dangers render more alert, And no cross accidents can disconcert. No task too complicated to surmount, Hardships and toils esteem'd of no account; Or if esteem'd, the prize but to enhance, Not to retreat incentives, but advance. Such valour like some wave-unshaken rock, Bears the approach unmov'd of every shock. Firm against fate, in each terrific form, As forest-oak that scorns the rushing storm. Ah such wert thou, unrival'd of thy kind, Whose loss now mourns the flock-entrusted hind, As by thy ruins he directs his way, Join'd by the Muse's sympathetic lay! Thus, in some silent solitary shade, When moonlight shadows croud the lonely glade, Bewails the bard, invited by the gloom, His darling maid cut off in early bloom; Cut off, her faded honours round her thrown, Ere youth's fair-opening blossom fully blown; As yonder lily fades, unkind the skies, Declines her head, shrinks, languishes, and dies. Nor let his tears of anguish cease to flow, His bosom cease from the big swell of wo. For who would give his gen'rous sorrows o'er, The first, the best of womankind, no more? The first in station; but her praise ascends Above what to the vilest chance intends. The first in merit, from the heart deriv'd! Merit, her death seal'd eye-lid that surviv'd! Merit, by Truth's own signature imprest, Which few sepulchral honours dare attest! Merit, alone by Him distinctly seen, Who objects views, no medium false between! Merit, that labours brighter to appear, As closing life's momentous scene draws near; Like stars the eye increas'd in lustre sees, The darker night advances by degrees! Like yon smooth stream that uniformly glides, Yon noontide ray no watery medium hides, Her temper in one happy tenour flow'd, Her breast with every gentle virtue glow'd; No sudden flight, beyond cool reason's curb, Her settled calm of spirit to disturb; No twitch of envy, no false sting of pride, Between extremes her passions to divide; Criterions of a soul ignobly born, An object, or of pity, or of scorn. Her heart love's tenderest ardours ever felt, Form'd exquisitely sensible to melt, When gentle Nature touch'd, with impulse kind, Its soften'd springs, to action still inclin'd. Whom obloquy herself could seldom tax With vanity, the foible of her sex; Unless her acts of bounty made her vain, To soothe affliction, and alleviate pain; Vain, that the blessing heart, and grateful eye, Could ne'er divine whence each well-tim'd supply. Can limits grief for such a maid require, While mankind virgin excellence admire? Shall Female Virtue draw her latest breath! Shall Beauty languish in the arms of Death! Shall Innocence descend to grace the urn! Shall blooming youth to vulgar dust return! Shall with Amanda all that's sweet depart! Nor yet one pang of sorrow pierce the heart! Yet Elegy the stroke afflictive bear, With cruel eyes scarce moisten'd with a tear? What horrours crouded to the lover's thought! How did he gaze, as to a statue wrought! What pangs endure, too mighty for relief! What feelings of unutterable grief! When, trembling, he her clay-pale cheek beheld, That once the rose-bud's painted blush excell'd! Saw her lips fetch the last returns of breath, And quiver in the agonies of death! Saw (his full soul elapsive in a sigh) The heav'nly beam leave her benighted eye! Expression falters to describe his wo, Which those who ever felt can only know. But whither has the Muse digress'd so long On subjects that seem foreign to her song? But why digress'd? thy fate, O luckless tree, And fair Amanda's, ah too well agree! Thy fall, by the fix'd mandate of the skies, Though undiscern'd by superficial eyes, Is emblematic of that final hour, When Death exerts—no spot-restricted power, But universal as existence runs, Where-ever worlds roll round their central suns. —But here the thought must not subsist too long, Again resum'd to close the plaintive song. Here, of its wonted shade superb bereav'd, To molehills shall the sordid earth be heav'd; That earth whose juices, by attraction soft, Once rose meand'ring to thy stems aloft; Now to give many a foul production birth, While Sorrow smooths the dimpled cheek of Mirth; For thus in dust dissolves the human frame, Congenial dust, whence it but lately came; Their fatness hence impov'rish'd soils derive, Hence worms regale, and vegetables thrive. Blush, blush! ye sons of levity and mirth! The monarch's death is but the reptile's birth, No plant shall henceforth here her balm bestow, No herb arise, no root salubrious grow; No May-flowers, dress'd in suits of virgin gold, With conscious pride their dew-dropt leaves unfold; No cowslip ope her bosom to the gale, No primrose her ambrosial sweets exhale. From these cut veins shall short-liv'd mushrooms sprout, Toads loathsome creep, and bloated snails crawl out. The russian spider here shall fell reside, With subtile guise along his lines to glide. Thy sacred root, whence sap concocted flow'd, And verdure to thy graceful form bestow'd, Hither from surly Winter to withdraw, Emmets shall pierce with unrelenting gnaw: While he, whom vagrant Fancy leads this way, Shall, with a sudden burst of anguish, say, “Ah! what a change! how desolate the place, “Where flourish'd one of Nature's tallest race, “In verdant Summer's silken livery clad, “And by the Seasons periodic fed! “Beneath the covert of whose outstretch'd arms, “Suckled by Spring in green display of charms, “Earth's smaller-statur'd sons spontaneous grew, “Catch'd the live breeze, or sipt the dulcet dew! “But whither ah! those lovely objects gone, “All now a naked waste I tread upon? “This spot no trace of beauty now retains! “Nought save the juiceless barren trunk remains, “Which, with quick lapse, a prey to vermin, must “Fall to decay, and mix with putrid dust! “Such characters of death just Heav'n inscribes, “With deep impress, on all earth's various tribes; “Such the almighty Fiat of the sky, “Let all things live in turn, let all things die.” Thus men, in nonage, infancy, or prime, By quick disease, or slow-consuming time, Howe'er high-plac'd on Fortune's partial wheel, Must Fate's decisive stroke promiscuous feel. Grandeur's gay plume, the native bloom of health, The charm of beauty, and the bribe of wealth, In vain, with all soft eloquence can say, Solicit Death to turn his dart away. Monarchs themselves, tho' prostrate at their throne Obsequious millions their allegiance own; Though distant regions tremble at their name, And Parian statues eternize their fame; From all their arrogated height of pow'r Must fall, when Heav'n appoints the destin'd hour. Nor kings alone; empires that fix'd we deem, Beyond Time's utmost reach that vainly seem, Shall by some hidden spring be overturn'd, Their basis shaken, and their lords inurn'd. But why on trifles dwells the local Muse, Why stoops she small comparisons to use, As thy misfortune typify'd alone The downfal of a kingdom, or a throne? These, though momentous in the lists of Fame, Of lofty import, of high-sounding name; Though haughtily enlarg'd from pole to pole, Are nothing, when contrasted with the whole. Like thee—no narrow despicable spot, Seiz'd by Ambition, parcell'd out by lot; But all Creation shall be overthrown, And Nature's self heave her expiring groan. See! from the bosom of a mantling cloud, A seraph, cloth'd in light, procaims aloud, Myriads of spirits round, a radiant band, And Fate's dread book extended in his hand; “Be life with all its various labours o'er, “Henceforth for ever time shall be no more. “Let yonder sun's proud glory cease to blaze, “In night extinguish'd his officious rays. “Cease yonder silver moon full-orb'd to rise, “Cease every star to twinkle through the skies. “Beneath my feet, contracted like a scroll, “Let these expanded heavens together roll. “To ruin be earth's mighty fabrics hurl'd, “And raz'd the pillars that support the world.” Thus, from her silent offsprings, Nature, fond Her works with human acts should correspond, With them, our duty fitly understood, Would teach the truest wisdom, being good, Or bless'd, for though dissimilar in name, Wisdom and happiness are still the same; Nought can divide what Heav'n's fix'd laws connect, That as the cause, or this as the effect; Titles or epithets can never change Objects and things, though they may disarrange: Not in some fine-spun theory it consists, Which varies as the writer's fancy lists, As interest or caprice directs his pen, The smiles or frowns of fallible, mere men; Not in the senseless pedantry of schools, Where men the knack of trifling learn by rules; Find out the glorious path, with much expense Of time and brains, that leads from common sense; Not in the idle subtilties of law, That oft from equity and Nature draw, The bounds of right and wrong explain away, Though obvious and distinct as night and day; Not politics, where most deserve to rise, That is, rear'd on a gallows, to the skies, While each, through villany, black crimes, and sins, Almost a traitor, his fell purpose wins: But, to comprise the sum of human good, In Virtue, Virtue rightly understood; Virtue, not as proud states or courts devise, But stamp'd with the broad signet of the skies; Or, as the moon shines by imputed light, In fair Religion's unstain'd glory bright. But say what Virtue's sacred name implies, So much esteem'd and valued by the wise. A treasure, all should study to obtain, Rather without it than a sceptre gain; A treasure riches seldom can procure, Grandeur monopolize, or fame ensure; A treasure that outweighs the regal gem, By clowns possess'd, though kings look down on them; A treasure, whose intrinsic value lies Less obvious oft to learn'd, than vulgar eyes. Contentment, that forsakes the cloyster'd cell, With artless pure Simplicity to dwell. A cordial, that supports us in distress, Beyond the pride-swoln philosophic guess. A temper, at each crisis of our fate, We fond would purchase, whatsoe'er the rate. A friend, that with us through Life's morning stays, Nor leaves us in the evening of our days; But, though of Earth's resplendent orb bereft, Bids brighter suns arise than that we left, Kindly from death's surrounding gloom to save, And gild the dreary mansions of the grave. A secret, sages never could unfold, That turns each baser metal into gold; That sets in motion. Pleasure's finest springs, Or casts a shade on all sublunar things. Labour, then, all true Virtue to acquire, That or to Heaven or happiness aspire. Thus may a falling tree those rules comprise, That make us humble, while they make us wise. Thus shall the Muse attain her noblest aim, Howe'er low-station'd in the rolls of Fame; Visit no more with Elegy the urn, But her sad song to panegyric turn. THE DEIST on a Deathbed The Muses never seem so worthily employed as when they are engaged in the cause of Virtue and Religion; and surely both must appear recommended by additional charms, when contrasted with the frightful spectacle exhibited in the following verses; which may serve as the writer's apology for making it public. It is no fiction of the brain, or specimen of poetical licence, but the true representation of an unhappy man in his last moments: A man of rank, learning, and fortune; but alas! during the course of a despicable and inglorious life, addicted to the grossest scenes of vice and impiety.—An obvious difficulty occurred in conducting this most disagreeable subject, viz. how to preserve the dreadful outlines of the picture, without, at the same time, introducing objects quite horrible to imagination, and shocking to humanity itself.—However, as it is, may it excite proper sentiments in the breast of every reader.. ? Avidos vicinum funus ut ægros Exanimat, mortisque metu sibi parcere cogit: Sic teneros animos aliena opprobria sæpe Absterrent vitiis ? Hor. O'erwhelming sight! life's torpid tide runs cold! Approach with awe the hopeless bed of death; A wretched mortal's closing scene behold! Convulsions seize him each returning breath: Just on Eternity's tremendous steep, How he forebodes the horrours of the dreadful deep! No worthy, virtuous actions, to enhance The peace and transport of his latter end, Now, with the sunshine of an angel's glance, Support his spirits, or his pains suspend: Years, months, ill-spent, with complicated charge, Rush on his troubled thoughts, and on each crime enlarge. Gentle repose his anguish'd pillow flies, Enamour'd of the couch where Virtue leans; Or, if a transient slumber shuts his eyes, Not comfort, but exchange of pain, it means: Restless and toss'd, imploring ease in vain, Ten thousand wild ideas shock his tortur'd brain. Wildly he glances round the weeping room, Tears up his hair, and lacerates his face, Circled with terrours, envelop'd in gloom, That on each feature leave their horrid trace: Keen anguish seizes his astonish'd heart, And twists its quiv'ring fibres in their tenderest part. Fiends seem to whisper torments in his ear, And flash their scorching lightnings in his eyes; His pangs of conscience more than man can bear, Weak helpless man, abandon'd by the skies; His life one endless round of daring sins, Self-judg'd, and self-condemn'd, where-e'er his search begins. Frantic he raves, he starts, he weeps, he grins, Convulsive sobs his heaving lungs divide; “Who,” he exclaims, “will snatch me from my sins? “Who from a just offended Maker hide? “Who put aside Death's deep embitter'd cup? “Or stay Jehovah's arm for vengeance lifted up? “O screen me from the fierceness of his wrath. “I see him sitting on his awful throne! “O stop, thou unrelenting tyrant, Death, “I hear tormented fiends, and furies groan! “I hear the rattling chain's infernal clank, “And see accusing demons clos'd in hostile rank. “O shade, ye mountains, this accursed head, “Within thy caverns, Earth, let me be lost; “Receive me, Ocean, to thy watery bed, “Whelm'd in thy eddies, with thy billows tost: “No more to see the sun's detested ray, “But senseless as the stone, or lifeless as the clay. “Unconsciousness with misery oft joins, “O were my senses with dead palsies struck— “Curse on the sire that bore me in his loins, “The hated breasts that gave me infant suck! “Curs'd be the guardians of my youthful days, “Damnation their reward, and infamy their praise! “Ah! cruel Health, how liberal thy supply “Through every scene of wickedness and lust! “Why did not lightnings blast my guilty eye, “And thunders bruise me level with the dust? “Ah! why did tygers my warm vitals spare? “Why did not whirlwinds sweep my atoms through the air? “Come, ye companions of my guilt and shame, “Did not our bosoms with one ardour burn? “Our pleasures still, and their alloys, the same, “What! absent all?—unmanly base return! “Such are Earth's paltry friendships—smooth disguise, “To cover meanness, self, ingratitude, and lies. “O! for some moments interval of time, “Gracious respite from Heav'n's vindictive blow; “No more, each brutal vice, each horrid crime, “Should point me out a spectacle below: “No more, in all her pride of borrow'd charms, “Should Pleasure, faithless Siren, court me to her arms. “To roll in oceans of sulphureous fire, “Remorse, with each curs'd recollection fraught, “Still stinging—never—never to expire!— “Burst, burst, my heart, and end this rack of thought. “Extinction! come—exert thy instant pow'r, “And end my pangs and being in one happy hour. “O were the thunder wrested from his hand, “Who fills the vast expansion of the skies, “Possess'd (alas!) of uncontrol'd command, “And quench'd the flaming terrours of his eyes! “O were Creation vanish'd from the sight, “And ev'ry thing return'd to chaos and to night! “But O! dread Sov'reign of the starry frame, “Is there no hope of mercy from thy throne? “Sure Mercy is thy chief, thy darling name, “Hear then a wretched mortal's dying groan: “Let his accumulated woes assuage “Thy wrath, tremendous wrath, and pity, ah! engage. “Didst Thou create a soul to damn and curse, “With senses only form'd to suffer pain? “Or, which is still, Eternal Father, worse, “Shall thy own Son bleed on a cross in vain? “Why then did life inspire the plastic clay, “Let not Redeeming Grace its impotence betray. “Presumptuous, bold, unworthy wretch!—below “The very savage that frequents the wild; “To Thee shall Heav'n's benign compassion flow, “So oft rejected and so oft revil'd? “Devils themselves, with hellish glee, might say, “Thus pearls were cast to swine, and mercy thrown away. “Hast thou not vilified that hallow'd Name “Which prostrate angels worship and adore? “Without remorse, without one pang of shame, “Blasphem'd his sacred Cross? could fiends do more? “From Thee what numbers caught their impious rage! “Taught from thy foul example to corrupt the age. “No, die, thou traitor, unlamented die! “Die, in the view of everlasting pangs; “While Mercy's self looks with consenting eye, “And Justice out her equal balance hangs! “For only thus, while heaven and earth applaud, “Can Truth itself be Truth, and God himself be God. “What! die?—be damn'd?—for ever mourn?—despair? “No moment's ease (O heav'ns!) no gleam of hope! “Shall Hell its dungeons, racks, and flames prepare, “To give malignant vengeance ample scope? “Well!—let its dungeons, flames, and racks, torment, “Till all the red-hot fury of the Godhead spent.— “But hear, thou Tyrant, whence all beings came, “Hear this my only, this my last, request; “When ages I have fed the scorching flame, “Ten thousand times ten thousand—let me rest: “When fiends themselves grow tir'd to hear me rave, “Oh! let me sink for ever in the silent grave.” Thus, Death's cold falter seizing on his tongue, With lips that quiver, and with eye-balls fix'd, His hands in agony together wrung, His cries ascend, with desperation mix'd. But ah! no comfort gilds his closing day, But deep Despair's sad clouds hang thick in black array! A flash of grief, not for a life ill spent, But present pain, and dread of future wo; Ah! this is not sincerely to repent, But formal mock'ry oft, and specious show. Distress can make quick penitents of all, But few (how few!) repent at Health's or Pleasure's call! He stares with grisly terrour in his face, He heaves, he bounds, he wreaths, he groans, he dies!— Good God! what horrours hover o'er the place, Where the poor heav'n-deserted sinner lies! But let the Muse here all reflections wave, God, in a moment, both can pardon and can save. O Virtue! may thy comforts still be mine, Sister of Wisdom! daughter of the skies! Whate'er my state below by will divine, Whether my outward fortunes sink or rise: Grant me the sunshine of a mind at ease, Protracted life, or death, then equally will please. Benign Religion, in thy friendly arms, Howe'er through Folly's paths we trod before, Howe'er we doted on far other charms, Gently would we recline, and be no more! O! at life's solemn period, be thou near, To smoothe my dying bed, to comfort, and to cheer. Let Grandeur then avert her scornful eye, Let Honour frown, and Wealth reject my claim; I matter not, sure of my native sky, What though unknown to Glory and to Fame! Wrote on my tomb, completed life's short span, “Here lies an humble Christian, and an honest man.” AN ELEGY Written in a FLOWER-GARDEN. Addressed to ? Now, when the lone sequester'd Muse invites, And westward points the sun his setting ray; Will Maria, whom the solitude delights, With her enjoy the faint remains of day? Music around, where arch'd espaliers wreathe, Would her fine ear in pleasing wonder fix; Zephyrs for her their humid odours breathe, And yonder skies unnumber'd colours mix. Now, mantled in her suit of sable grey, Her breeze-fann'd tresses hung with pearls of dew, Evening arrives; her gentle call obey, Abroad her darkling footsteps to pursue. How the still silence of embow'ring shades Transports the mind, urg'd by no fancy'd wants! Sylvestran scenes, hills, meadows, upland glades, The cascade's lapse, and wilderness's haunts! Nor, to the sober ear of Fancy, does The hooting owl, from antiquated tow'r, Nor hornet, wheeling round in ceaseless buzz, Abate the sweetness of the solemn hour: Nor Philomel, that through the woodbine copse Pours forth her love-lorn melody of wo; Kind warbler, when mild Eve her curtain drops, Whose melting strains no vulgar period know! Hark! how yon turtle's sadly-pensive notes The fix'd dull ear of Melancholy soothe! How gently down the stream each murmur floats, Care's ruffled brow by magic charm to smoothe! Not to the wide-stretch'd lawn shall we repair, Where Beauty's offspring lead ambrosial lives; Nor sloping hill, from whence, in prospect fair, An ampler swell the rural scene derives: But where Art's finer imagery is shown, Her pow'rs of fancy, drapery, and taste; Amid these ranks of lilies, all full-blown, Where Nature charms the more, the nearer trac'd. Let Pride's swoln boasts subside to accents meek, And Passion lull asleep her self-rais'd storm; Hence, Mirth loquacious, with sarcastic cheek, With rolling eye, and agitated form. Now let the lyre to Elegy be strung, Obliquely thus to dwell on Maria's praise; O! would the native music of her tongue To kindred rapture wake the plaintive lays! Not the vain-letter'd tomb, or sculptur'd bust, Shall the sad sympathetic strain suggest; Riches may moulder in congenial dust, And humbled Grandeur in oblivion rest: Let faithful pencils, that in just profile Would place the human portrait, but outline The naked Lily, when soft Seasons smile, Or Winter's frosts the stagnate streams confine. Here then may Elegy her tale begin, Your taste will polish, what your fancy chose; In sprighty circles oft the palm you win, To twine a nobler wreath the Lily grows. Nor vainly grows, if, while the Muses sing, The fair will listen to the friendly lay, And take, as bees sip honey whilst they cling, The moral with the lighter sound away. Beneath the kindly nurture of the skies, The Lily her fair Vestal charms unfolds; No rival beauty near presumes to rise, And ev'ry eye is ravish'd that beholds. The florist takes his eve-invited walk, And round his painted family surveys; But none her graceful bend of slender stalk, Her milk-white bosom, soft as down, displays. When rosy-featur'd Vesper, from her urn, The glist'ring dews effusively distills; The Lily's fragrance welcomes her return, While she imbibes the moisture's orient rills. To form the Lily fairest flow'r that springs, A thousand tubes Earth's finest sap convey; Kind Zephyrs fan her with dew-moisten'd wings, And day and night their stated turns obey. The Lily, as in beauty, so in smell, Claims the first class amongst the flowery tribe; Singly on either did the numbers dwell, Scarce would the numbers half her charms describe. So, for the dew-soft twinkle of an eye, The bloom of features, or the ease of shape, In Maria's praise did poets merely vie, Unnoted would her noblest praise escape. True, she is lovely, as e'er eye beheld, Lovely, as Nature paints, or Art adorns; But, though in beauty half her sex excell'd, That beauty she still heightens, while she scorns. Merit that still affects to lie conceal'd, As diamonds sparkle on some rock unknown, Like light itself, should be to all reveal'd, Whether it grace a cottage, or a throne. Lucia the young, the sprightly, blooming fair, To try how far her lover's praises due, Would with the Lily's whiteness her's compare, But finds that false she fondly reckon'd true. On silken ground would Art attempt to draw The Lily, with the needle's mimic pow'r; But who so poor a counterfeit e'er saw, That e'er beheld a nature-portray'd flow'r? Dipt in the choice of artificial paint, The pencil too a like vain task essays; But how, compar'd, inelegant and faint! How pigmy Art her littleness betrays! Want we some softer epithet to name Native unspotted maiden virtue by, That turn of thought not Maria's self can blame? All by the Lily's whiteness we imply. To give proud Beauty her intrinsic praise, Nor yet a well-tim'd compliment unpaid; It the pure ivory's polish scarce conveys, The Lily's white we summon to our aid. But ah! though dress'd in Beauty's choicest robe, Though eastern kings less glorious to behold; When Winter sends his tempests round the globe, Those graces fade that now so gay unfold. His ruffian colds her root's soft tendrils seize, His blasts deep riot on her snowy charms; Vainly she courts, intent as wont to please, The dew that moistens, or the ray that warms. Faded, the eye no virgin whiteness meets, The sordid weed in beauty rudely vies; Her breath too loses all its fragrant sweets, She sinks her head, droops, languishes, and dies. Just emblem, Maria, though discern'd by few, Of that soft sex, whose ornament you shine; This maxim, grav'd on adamant, how true, “Sure as arise, must Beauty's sun decline!” To-day, we flourish in vertumnal bloom, Display'd our blossoms and our foliage gay; Next, Winter comes, deep-muffled up in gloom, Tears up our roots, and sweeps our charms away. Not surer Beauty dyes the virgin's lip In vermile, rich as roses blown enjoy, Than Death, who loves the fairest buds to nip, With cold, cold touch, that vermile will destroy. Let then each Lily youthful Celia views, How fair remind her, but how fading too; That, hence, will sweets more exquisite diffuse, Celia boast charms before she never knew. For, haply, some sad twilight-vagrant swain Shall oft revolve, engrav'd, the fair one's doom, Cut off, the fam'd Monimia Alluding to the elegy under this title. of the plain, In Youth's gay spring, and Health's unsully'd bloom. The EPITAPH. [Here lies, beneath this moss-encircled stone] Here lies, beneath this moss-encircled stone, That form which once the Graces all inspir'd; In youthful circles joyous oft she shone, Prais'd by each tongue, by every eye admir'd. The Lily, quicken'd by the breath of Spring, A fair resemblance of her youth display'd; A zephyr shook around its balmy wing, To image health, priz'd by the blooming maid. But lo! not long the Lily's triumphs last, The snowy beauty of the flow'ry ground; Soon sweeps abroad the North's inclement blast, Shrivels her leaves, and scatters them around. Soon too the lovely emblem is forgot, The light vain fair borne on phantastic toe; That such fine spirits sink, she credits not, That fades Youth's blossom, or Health's roseate glow. Deluded maid! a slighted languor caught, The fever's strong delirium soon acquir'd; From puny Art relief ah vainly sought! At Hope's false shrine a victim she expir'd. Let then the eye a passing tribute pay, That here all Beauty's ruins shortly croud; That, like the Lily, youth and health decay, Laid in the tomb, and mantled in a shroud. On the Death of a beloved Friend cut off in the Prime of Life. ? Juvenem raptum Plorat.? Hor. The smiling Spring, with all her jocund train, The brook that glides along the mossy plain; The birds that warble undisturb'd by care, The gales that gently agitate the air; The vista green, and honey-suckle shade, The flowery meadow, and the sunny glade; Delight no more: Spring vainly smiles relief To nicely-feeling hearts o'erwhelm'd with grief. Ye dreary regions! ye impervious glooms, Where sickly Fancy uncouth forms assumes, And, on these ghostly phantoms of her brain, Muses with pleasure strongly mark'd with pain; Where Melancholy broods o'er her distress, Yet strange! half disinclin'd to have it less; Where death-like Silence fixes her domain, Save when loud screech-owls dolefully complain; Hither the sullen pensive Muse would fly, Where tears may flow from Friendship's gushing eye; Where Echoes, in sad accents like her own, Give sigh for sigh, and answer groan with groan! O Life! thou empty, transitory thing! Thou airy trifle ever on the wing! Thou bubble dancing on the restless stream! Thou meteor false! thou unsubstantial dream! What is it thy vain pageant name implies? What art thou, glitt'ring phantom, to the wise? A moment tears thee from thy votary's hold, Vainly secur'd by honours and by gold. When such as?from thy scenes withdraw, His choice according thus with Nature's law, Ere the fair flow'r of vouth maturely blown, Thy sweets and vices equally unknown; Who would affect, with poverty of mind, In mean pursuits to linger here behind? Ah! how can mem'ry recognize his name, Nor yet the song of soft condolence frame! How can the gentle graces of his mind, His kind benevolence to humankind; His temper's cheerful unaffected ease, His soul's sincere solicitude to please; His tender sensibility of heart, That with kind pity throbb'd in every part; Who, the Possessor gone, can these recall To mind, nor let the tear of anguish fall! None here in genuine sorrow can exceed, But he from Friendship's ties, and Nature's, freed. The noblest minds are most to pity bent, And gen'rous natures oftenest relent; The savage spirit, and unsocial heart, Feel not, O Sympathy! thy pleasing smart. Dear Youth! companion of the placid hour, When Friendship call'd forth ev'ry social pow'r; From thy decease one lesson may I learn, Which theories vainly teach us to discern; That to live well, is learning how to die, And scorning earth, is to possess the sky. Yonder he sleeps on Death's cold senseless lap, Death, to the good, is but a peaceful nap, In which from num'rous ills it shuts his eyes, Till the last trump invites him to arise. Behold these smiles o'er all his features spread, Are smiles the wonted graces of the dead? No; though depriv'd of mere mechanic breath, He speaks in silence, and exists in death. To the Memory Of the Reverend Mr John Bonar. Magnum sui desiderium moriens reliquit. Hor. By all the wise admir'd, the good esteem'd, For what he really was, not barely seem'd; Form'd upon Virtue's amiable plan, An honest, upright, candid, worthy man; Whose conduct not ev'n Slander e'er pursu'd, Which still the brighter shone, the nearer view'd; Though plac'd in public life, where, to espy Each word, each act, is center'd ev'ry eye; Where trivial slips and blemishes arise To grossest faults in the stern censor's eyes: Thus Bonar liv'd; and to life's period brought, Died, as an humble, modest Christian ought. O reader, now howe'er your views aspire, May you with equal dignity retire. On the Death of The Reverend Mr James Hervey. On vulgar marks Death long had meanly spent His loaded quiver, and his bow full bent; Monarchs, who had been great but for a crown, Statesmen and heroes, sons of high renown; When lo! in Heav'n this awful mandate past, “To-morrow's dawn be some fam'd mortal's last.” The tidings, to our world officious sent, Through Albion's isles on wing of lightning went: Impiety, her heart by vipers stung, Again blasphemes with loud audacious tongue; Vice stalks abroad, each late retreat forsook, With all her bold effrontery of look: But ah! while these malignant triumph show, Far other bosoms other feelings know! The Muse in vain conceals her weeping eye, And each tear Learning answers with a sigh! Religion starts, though arm'd with tenfold shield, And Virtue shrinks, though she disdains to yield: —The arrow sped, Death took his aim too well, The mitred pontiff liv'd, and Hervey fell. To the Memory of William Shenstone, Esq Quis desiderio sit pudor, aut modus Tam chari capitis? ? Hor. Ye sacred Pow'rs of Harmony! if such E'er put the sable robe of mourning on; Now, when no gen'rous eye can weep too much, Now shed the plaintive tear, for Shenstone's gone. Nor fled a kindred spirit to the skies Lamented more by all the tuneful train! But him they vain implore, with streaming eyes, To animate his gentle form again! Ah! not for this, Death with officious grasp Seiz'd the strung lyre that trembled in his hand, While to his breast his arms tenacious clasp, And angels round but half-consenting stand! Ah! not for this, the early sudden call, Some radiant seraph's golden harp to tune, While humbly he his own on earth let fall, But ah! Humanity still thinks too soon! For Shenstone gone, while Silence muses round, Hear the sad Genius of each grove bewail! Villas return the melancholy sound, And echoes dwell upon the mournful tale! Sad murmurs waft it down the gurgling brook! Sad Zephyrs sigh it through the conscious shade! To Heav'n when he his blissful journey took, Few pow'rs of song behind their Shenstone staid. Shenstone! with what inchanting voice he sung! How smooth, how chaste, how soft, his numbers flow! How on each note the ravish'd shepherds hung! How did their hearts dilate! their bosoms glow! For oft he fond deceiv'd the lengthen'd hours, To copy Nature, made immortal hence— How delicately Love's all-gentle pow'rs Touch'd into life his nicely-feeling sense! How few, O Nature, happily excel In thy prime gifts, simplicity and ease? Thy careless elegance becomes us well, If we the ear would captivate, or please. Say, whence the labour'd strains neglected flow, Tho' haughty Learning boasts each splendid line? Hence, would the self-proud critic deign to know, Beyond thy test, O Nature! we refine. How little Art imparts, when all she gives, Vainly to rival him by Thee inspir'd, Let Shenstone tell!—but ah! no Shenstone lives, Else angels mourn a bard from Heav'n retir'd! Heav'n claims its bards, a laurel-circled throng, A few revolving suns to mortals lent; From Earth, if haply tarrying there too long, To summon them, Death's on kind message sent. Thus he, who grew immortal as he sung The blissful pair in Eden's happy clime; Rehearses now, with rapture on his tongue, To gods the wonders of his theme sublime. Thus, the remembrance all our grief renews, While we a Pope or Addison deplore; Thus mourns in elegiac verse the Muse Britannia's boast, her Shenstone, now no more! But Nature means no triumph o'er her son, For not unkind she earth of him deprives; Let then no more our tears officious run, Shenstone still lives, while she herself survives. On the Death of Mr Churchill. Thus runs the motto sculptur'd on each urn, “Man's sprung from dust, and shall to dust return.” No rank, no station can exempt from death, The monarch's life sustain'd but by a breath. Howe'er we vainly flutter for a while, And fondly bask in Fortune's flattering smile; Howe'er we sneer at Virtue's humble sons, Whose life in one calm modest tenour runs; Howe'er a puff of fame extolls our parts, And swells with pride our little empty hearts; Howe'er beprais'd we wield the author's pen, And think ourselves hence something more than men; Howe'er a Faction would assert our claim To the high honours of immortal fame; Howe'er we strut and swagger, speak and look, For Valour's sons egregiously mistook; Death, who despises all this farce of life, Foe to Pride's triumphs, and Ambition's strife, Steps in, delay indulg'd on no pretence, And snatches our astonish'd spirits hence. No force, no cunning can the stroke repel, Nor youth, nor strength of limb:—thus Churchill fell. Vice had not triumph'd, when Fate's arrow flew, Had Churchill's works been but as mortal too; He then had prov'd, on Charity's kind plan, A well-intention'd, harmless, honest man; A nobler triumph, than the amplest fame Annex'd to a mere literary name To the Memory Of the Reverend Dr Edward Young. Non—genus, non te facundia, non te Restituet pietas ? Hor. O death! relentless tyrant of the grave! Implacable alike to king and slave! Why hast thou spar'd, at some unlucky hour, Ambition, on his pinnacle of pow'r; The traitor, villain, the blasphemer foul, The drunkard, swearing by the midnight bowl; The spendthrift, folded in the harlot's arms, Gazing with fatal ardour on her charms; Wrapt in wild visions the projector bold, The miser yawning o'er his heaps of gold; The robber, sliding through the midnight gloom, Still deeper guilt to aggravate their doom; Why spar'd these monsters, yet Young snatch'd away, Just to evince thy impotence of sway? No conquest here thy vengeful dart can claim, When Time has vanquish'd thee, to live his name. Yet had not thy commission'd arrow flown, Unfill'd in Heav'n had been a seraph's throne. Hail! hoary bard of night, whose fam'd Complaint Is now turn'd to the triumphs of the saint; For nought, a knowing head, and feeling heart, Virtue and Genius, could in thee dispart! Ah! how can Recollection these employ, Nor sink to genuine grief the pulse of joy? Thy fancy, learning, judgment, wit, and taste, Ne'er brib'd by Fortune, nor deceiv'd by haste! Thy love of friendship, harmony, and peace, Which still thy growing years observ'd increase! Thy piety, chaste, manly, and sublime, Uninfluenc'd by modes of place and time! Thy noble scorn of honours and of pelf, Which to attain, one must renounce himself! Ah! how can Recollection these employ, Nor sink to genuine grief the pulse of joy? O could I, Young, on the fleet lightning's wing, To thine and Virtue's orb superiour spring; Could I, a disembodied spirit, fly To thee and all the glories of the sky; Pass yonder sun, on his meridian throne, Array'd in splendours gorgeous as his own; Pass Heav'n's resplendent gates, thrown open wide, With thee and kindred angels to reside; Be ravish'd while some first-rate seraph sings, And hear and see unutterable things: On earth no moment should retard my stay, How like Elijah would I soar away! But O the pinion aquiline must drop, And Fancy her aëreal ranges stop. Alas! like Young, few from life's stage retire, Few mount his hallow'd vehicle of fire. But could I claim his Virtues, as below All ranks on them their lavish praise bestow, Call his departed excellence my own, As He from Heav'n the hallow'd mantle thrown; His merit in another make survive, Though dead himself, his graces still alive; These, next to the possession of the skies, Would give me all that happiness implies, O had I his seraphic cast of thought, Unaw'd by tyrant custom, and untaught, Unpriz'd, unenvy'd should he reign alone, Who sits a slave imperial on a throne! For what are sceptres, if the princely heart To bless mankind knows not the godlike art? Sublime ambition! scarce by that excell'd (Without their guilt) by which arch-fiends rebell'd: Crowns, richly set with many a costly gem, Look pale, if Virtue shuts her eye on them; The royal laurels languish, if meanwhile Deny'd the living sunshine of her smile. By various proofs his usefulness appear'd, The drooping heart disconsolate he cheer'd; Supported Merit at his own expense, And cast round Innocence a firm defence; Reliev'd the wretch beneath Oppression's stroke, Worn out with labour, and with hardships broke; Found Virtue out, howe'er in rags disguis'd, The wav'ring fix'd, the ignorant advis'd. Thrice happy shade! late did the sylvan Muse Thee as the patron of her numbers chuse, Hoping, beneath the sanction of thy name, Censure to shun, if not to merit fame; As oaks, from humbly creeping on the ground, Raise kindly up the ivy clasp'd around. But ah! how soon the friend of Virtue fled To Heaven, through the dark regions of the dead; Dark to the vulgar class of humankind, That there no torch lit by Religion find; But gilded, to thy spirit on its way, With the strong radiance of immortal day. Yet shall the widow'd verses sacred be To thy dear memory, that sole pledge of thee. Howe'er the common run of mean desert Dies with the feeling brain, and beating heart, With mere Mortality's abhorr'd remains, Rots in the grave, where dumb oblivion reigns; No sordid motive shall eraze thy name, Alive or dead, thy merit still the same The reader may think it superfluous to be informed here, that this alludes to Vertumnus; or, The Progress of Spring, inscribed to the late pious, learned, and ingenious Dr Edward Young; the first volume of these poems, as well as a good part of the second, being printed off before his decease.. MONIMIA; OR, THE UNFORTUNATE BEAUTY. ADDRESSED TO MARIA. [illeg.] facite, et tumulo superaddite carmen. Virg. Attend, fair Maria, not averse to hear A friendly Muse in Elegy complain; But why brood o'er distress, when Maria's near, Whose blooming charms inspire the sprightly strain? Yet, gentle Maid, the tender thrill of thought Is now implor'd, the sorrow-humid eye; The melting heart with sweet sensations fraught, The soften'd aspect, and the heaving sigh. So fine a swell of sentimental grief, So soft a touch of sympathetic wo, That seek no vulgar impotent relief; Virtue alone can boast, or Maria show. When Pity moves the trembling strings of life, The quicken'd heart feels exquisite all o'er; Feels, no rude passions in unfriendly strife, But pleasure mix'd with sadness please the more. To pity Worth, is to esteem it too, Esteem in others, is ourselves to claim; Pity is Merit's immemorial due, Thus, then, self-praise and pity are the same. No heart can Pity's prompt emotions feel, But that once moulded by Love's gentle hand; The unrelenting heart's fenc'd round with steel, Beneath no social Passion's mild command. Who pities then, a nice-form'd taste declares, All that is fair or lovely to admire; A bias soft to Friendship's tender cares, And all the sweets of elegant desire. Here, as a Lily sunk beneath the storm, Your beauteous likeness, save in woes, behold; For manner, sweetness, and exteriour form, Where charms beyond the vulgar boast unfold. The breath of Spring, with her selected sweets, But a faint emblem of her temper give; How seldom one her fair resemblance meets, Too excellent to die, too good to live! But these avail'd not to his ruffian eye, Who void of all, would meanly all despise; Ne'er did the gildings of a vernal sky Prevent the Earthquake's shock, or tempest's rise. Attend then, Maria, let your candour plead The Muse's pardon, as your smiles inspire; And suffer her your lonely steps to lead Where only Folly's backward to retire. The rueful vault, the mattock, and the grave, The bust funereal, and the cypress shade, That set the monarch level with his slave, Make only little vulgar minds afraid. Come then, the meek superiour of your sex, For beauty, though that beauty least your praise; Behold what ills unnumber'd may perplex A helpless maid, yet all her virtues raise. If, from the pure expanse of rural skies, Where vernal breezes, dews, and sunshine cheer, Prison'd in rooms, the lily deigns to rise, How alter'd all her native charms appear! Diseas'd and languid looks her form throughout, Which Spring abroad as her first beauty shows, Less balmy sweets she breathes profuse about, And all her leaves their glossy whiteness lose. Just so, to gratify some wretched view, The little caprice of an abject mind; What changes in the fair one's looks ensue, If by severe tyrannic laws confin'd! The lily, then, on Sorrow's call attends, In sickly languor o'er her features spread; Not love-meek Innocence herself befriends, From each bright eye the living lustre fled! Such was, alas! Monimia's hapless doom, For shall the Muse the secret deed conceal? Guilt all would bury in eternal gloom, But Justice must the direful truth reveal, This boast of Beauty, and of Virtue twain, A fatal law Lorenzo forc'd to wed; He woo'd, not Merit, but vile sordid Gain, Not for his heart a partner, but his bed. Those, who assum'd, stretch'd pow'r parental too, Beyond what God or Nature ever meant; True; she from them her breath precarious drew, But not that soul which knows no mean restraint. Oft on her knees, and with tear-flooded eye, Would she implore one favour, one alone, Which pride with meanness only could deny, Her choice implore, a Man of worth, or none. “If wed I must, let Theron be the man, “Whose birth and manners all conspire to please; “Though not by Fortune fashion'd to your plan, “Yet at his board sit Plenty, Joy, and Ease. “His form—but not his beauty strikes my eye, “Yet is he lovely, and from childhood known; “He hears Distress, but not unpitied, sigh, “Virtue and he long since familiars grown. “Yet Theron, and his offers, I resign, “To purchase all to me, a Parent's smile; “This be your triumph, as the duty mine, “But ah! my ruin not your triumph style! “What though Lorenzo's coffers swell with pelf, “Still is he wretched, poor, and mean withal; “His god, his friend, his neighbour, is—himself, “Malice may blast, he can no lower fall. “Be his!—O let a prostrate suppliant move! “This filial tear, this heart-commission'd sigh! “Command me to respect him, but to love— “Thine, Theron, must I be—a maid—or die!—” Sweet injur'd fair!—what, such distress survey, Hear the fond pleadings of a heart so soft, Yet Nature's rising impulse disobey! Oft as the sob recurr'd, suppress'd as oft! Such too, (to blot the annals of mankind, And blast with infamy those tender names) Her parents!—Nature them as such design'd, But she the brutal violence disclaims. They saw her gentle soul dissolv'd in tears, And heard the melting arguments she sobb'd; But with the adder's unrelenting ears, The eye of savage, of her younglings robb'd! In words, that on each sense like thunder broke, Which scarce the Muse repeats unruffled o'er; Thus they replied, and menac'd as they spoke, “Lorenzo's your's, or you our child no more. “Lorenzo!—think what honours grace his name! “How high thro' times remote runs his descent! “How vast his riches, which by lineage came! “Lorenzo slight?—would you too late repent? O Gold! thou splendid enemy to Love! What crouds, for thee, to ruin headlong run! When Merit, Youth, and Beauty fail to move, For thee we wed, we wed, and are undone! But not thus, in expostulations vain, They still control'd the freedom of her choice; By actual force each conquer'd her disdain, Too mild the threat'nings of a loud-rais'd voice. They conquer'd? no; superiour to delay, Monimia chose, though all her scorn alive, Chose rather certain death, than disobey, Deeply impress'd, not long she could survive. But here, let none her sad example prize, Monimia err'd, howe'er her motive pure; Nature's first sacred mandate we practise, When we ourselves from misery secure. Not so Monimia; she, with great resolve, Her fate provok'd, her piety to save; But such excesses few in woes involve, For Virtue's sake how few prefer the grave! Who dare the Hymeneal rites profane, Concord's chaste joys with souls mispair'd to taste? Justly all such seek happiness in vain, Winter's chill damps their hopes in blossom waste. “Let two be one,” kind Nature loud proclaims, But men with sacrilegious hands divide; The selfish wed, while only Virtue blames, By scrolls and settlements, not hearts, ally'd. But let not pert Detraction, foul-mouth'd elf, Blot the fair transcript of the sex's fame; Let men caress that bosom-viper, self, At once their crime, their punishment, and shame. Let Nature dictate, Prudence fix the choice, And Love preside, with tender wish, o'er all; Be then the words pronounc'd with steady voice, Men must them equal, angels happy call. But ah! far other sad Monimia's fate, Born underneath some dark ill-omen'd star! When Paradise had op'd her blissful gate, Some dæmon interpos'd a triple bar! While, in the sunshine of a summer's day, Through the dun umbrage coo'd the Turtle-dove, The falcon spy'd his unsuspecting prey, And to her guiltless heart his talons drove. But be that wretch abandon'd to despair, From his curs'd roof let Happiness depart, Who would by base compulsions gain the Fair, Who would commit an outrage on the heart. Lorenzo! what black fiend thy breast inspir'd, To murder Innocence, in horrid glee; A fair Disconsolate, by all admir'd, As form'd the exquisite reverse of thee? Though gibbets rot e'er such fell miscreants die, Guilt, like some vulture, shall thy heart-strings gnaw; Dire in thy face shall Hydra terrours fly, And thou on racks expire, in spite of law. Monimia trembling to the altar goes, All speechless, like a lamb to slaughter led! Warm on her cheek no blush connubial glows, The lily triumphs in the rose's stead! Her hand, that hung down lifeless by her side, The guilty bridegroom seizes as his own; Scarce her despair and anguish could she hide, Yet sigh'd not, haply, lest reluctance shown! Oh! had Death's summons all his hopes beguil'd, And snatch'd her senseless from his horrid arms! Or had she bloom'd in some far distant wild, In all her virgin elegance of charms! There, haply, soon some shepherd swain had stray'd, His soul all gentle, as unmatch'd his form; Beheld, admir'd, and woo'd the charming maid, Each other's star through life's tumultuous storm. Each other's Heav'n, from rude inspection hid, Undamp'd by envy, and remote from wo; Each other's soul of harmony, amid The bustle of discordant strife below. Each other's treasure, though no diamonds flame With lustre of vain glory on their hands; Though, tack'd fantastic to a paltry name, No mouldy rent-rolls swell with charter-lands. Each other's fame, though no loud trumpets blow, While human ears, as sponges rain, absorb; Each other's world in miniature, to throw A shadow of eclipse on Bourbon's orb. Oh! had Monimia, from the tyger's fangs, Been folded thus in Lov's encircling arms; No beauteous prey to Sorrow's wasting pangs, No fiend to riot on an angel's charms! But how superlative had Virtue shone, How thus Religion prov'd her birth divine, Riches uncurs'd, not to Lorenzo thrown, And thus marr'd Heav'n's just, righteous, good design? He gain'd Monimia, nor her value knew, But as the conquest gratified his pride; Her fortune was the object in his view, Nor could disguise his low pretensions hide. Alas! hard is the lot of womankind, By mercenary traffic bought and sold! Reason ne'er weighs the beauties of the mind, If but the sordid balance sinks with gold! Nor wonder, with the first revolving moon, Scarce common proofs of tenderness she shar'd; How much unlike, her fate evinc'd too soon, An angel and a fiend in union pair'd. As Love no corner of his heart possest, And all his schemes of vile ambition gain'd; A jealous frenzy seiz'd his troubled breast, Though not a thought Monimia's honour stain'd. But let not Candour varnish o'er the tale, His jealous qualms were feign'd, the wretch confest, That the pretext his views might more avail, And she with seeming justice be distrest. Conscious how little merit he can claim, Or to attract, or fix, a female heart, To lower her's, a base unmanly aim, He acts the villain's, and detractor's part. Rudely from all society cut off, But that abhorr'd, society with him; She lives a cloister'd object of his scoff, His hated passion, petulance, and whim. The tyrant soon he proves, wrapt in disguise, Veiling his curs'd design with specious art; Naked before her view at once it lies, Alarms her fears, and wounds her to the heart. With all Love's tender, meek, persuasive pow'rs, Would she engage that heart she never priz'd, While tears escape her in portentous show'rs, In vain, her soft endearments all despis'd. Till Cruelty grew weary of restraint, Some medium still the sly deceiver kept; Once too, in spite of all the tyrant meant, Nature relented, and Lorenzo wept. But not alone avowedly severe, He treats this matchless wonder of her sex; His very kindnesses how insincere! His blandishments themselves all fram'd to vex! But would Monimia's hardships claim belief, Varied by ev'ry wicked mean device? Her gentle spirit sinks beneath her grief, How could she purchase death, whate'er the price! Yet so resign'd, so humble in her wo, Still she possess'd such dignity of thought, That from her lips no bitter railings flow, No murmurs with a bold impatience fraught. True; she is wretched, of all hope bereft, Touch'd in her quickest sense of home-felt smart; But still uninjur'd Innocence is left, Not wounded is her conscience, but her heart. Little reflect the gay fantastic croud, Whose ev'ry wish its darling object meets, What numbers would to life prefer the shroud, Those too whom Folly Fortune's chosen greets. Within the circle of domestic life What passes, by the vulgar eye unseen; Howe'er the sphere of misery and strife, Affects us coolly, as it ne'er had been. Boast not those tyrants born of regal line, Whom crowns protect, howe'er enlarg'd their crimes; Such milder seem, in caprice and design, Than each home-thron'd Lorenzo of our times. Let poets, ne'er to real life confin'd, Emblazon forth great names whom kings oppress; Their ranks, but not misfortunes, strike mankind, These, like their virtues, than Monimia's less. The silent grief, that preys upon the heart, The inward anguish, and the bosom-pang; Like deadly serpents twist round life, nor part, Till Death releases from the poison'd fang. But O! may happier suns on Maria shine, In the soft radiance of one cloudless day! And, at mild Evening's gradual late decline, May not a shade obscure their setting ray! May no false traitor, in Love's sacred mask, Be her's, as once, alas! Monimia's lot; But He, with whom would please the rural task, The sylvan banquet, and the shepherd's cot. Nor scorn that softness, Charmer, to with-hold, That silent tear, that gently-swelling sigh; Her ills, howe'er in simple numbers told, Might melt the flinty heart, and savage eye. Nature to Man the daring soul assign'd, At but his Maker's dread rebuke to start; But, of materials soften'd and refin'd, To tender feelings form'd the female heart: And while Monimia's sorrows we deplore, We pay that tribute Virtue styles her own, A tribute that enriches us the more, Tears are the debt, and Merit is the loan. Beyond the maxims of the Stoic page, Researches vain of metaphysic pride; Her mournful story may instruct the age, At once to mend its manners, and deride. But who would purchase, at Monimia's rate, The fatal lesson, better ah untaught! Tho' hence styl'd philosophically great, And high on Fame's celestial pinion caught? Who to shine forth, tho' mark'd by Virtue's stamp, A bright and fair example to mankind, Would certain hopes of bliss remorseless damp, Or in Lorenzo's arms them blasted find! Sure, boding screech-owls hover'd round, to pour, While Justice equipois'd her balance hangs, Black frightful omens on his natal hour, Thrown into life with more than wonted pangs. When births enormous Nature bursts to light, By previous signals she forewarns mankind; Lest the fell wonder might o'erwhelm the sight, And fatally surprise the guardless mind. Yet, who of Heav'n could once himself persuade, If no Monimias grac'd our world below? Their bright example comes to Reason's aid, When her bewilder'd pow'rs no farther go. Nor for probation were this life design'd, Did no Lorenzos on its joys obtrude: Thus all-wise Providence to humankind, Ill but permits, as conducive to good. But now the Muse digresses from her theme, Fond of a respite from indignant grief; But ah! Lorenzo, cruel to extreme, Ne'er knew the art divine to give relief! Soon on her health his brutal usage preys, Howe'er a more than female firmness bore; His merc'less eyes her wasting charms surveys, As if a smile their lustre would restore. Long tir'd of life, with all its rude alarms, Its phantom comforts, and substantial ills; Now but Religion boasts intrinsic charms, While chaste Devotion all her bosom fills. Nor did Affliction kindle in her breast A sacred flame that glow'd not there before; Her brighter days the same pure flame confest, Though Virtue, haply, now endear'd the more. When some distress with hasty step invades, For aid let cowards to Religion turn; Their holy fires, but in Grief's sullen shades, Seldom in Fortune's sunshine, partial burn. The ray from Fortune vainly shot around, To throw a splendour on Monimia's fame, Its ample sphere illum'd already found, There lost, or back reflected whence it came. “Let Fortune turn aside, with footstep proud, “And Fortune's haughty minions, Wealth and Fame, “And Grandeur, circled by their menial croud, “Nor waste their honours on Monimia's name: “If fair Religion, with her gentle guests, “Her cherub train of Graces, scorn her not; “Unpinion'd from her flight Ambition rests, “Nor would a crown add splendour to her lot. “Religion! with what peace, a life well spent, “For thee employ'd its each returning breath, “What rapture, words would vainly represent, “In thy divine embrace we yield to death! Thus, with an intellectual soar of thought, Would she her heart's fond wishes oft express; Nor were those angel inmates vainly sought, To grace Monimia's dwelling, or to bless. But ah! such is the dread decree below, The brightest worth oft-times seems most oppress'd; That vain short-sighted mortals hence might know, Life is not her reward, but Virtue's test. Who, else, could bear the burden of his woes? Who fight with pain, nor hope a kind discharge? Monimia, else, had ne'er to angel rose, Her patience vast, as her misfortunes large. But shall the Muse on her sad story dwell, To taste the bitter anguish of her fate? —A victim to his cruelty she fell! He saw his dreadful errour when too late! Yet, while eternal slumbers seal'd her eyes, And thro' each vein Death's freezing chillness ran; With feeble voice, and falt'ring lips, she cries, “May mercy and forgiveness meet the man! “O Love Immortal! thine's the Godlike pow'r, “And thine alone, to pity and forgive! “If pardon then awaits my dying hour, “O may He not that hour unpardon'd live!” Nor more she utter'd: like the lily pale, The sweetness of her looks scarce chang'd by death; While no fierce throbs her tender frame assail, As saints expire, she draws her latest breath. Yet though Monimia's sorrows wing'd the dart That stopt a while her temporary breath; Her and distress Fate could alone dispart, Her glory dawn'd amid the shades of death. O'er her decease the Muses love to weep, Nor from the bier can Friendship lift her eye! Together both sad mournful vigils keep, Sighing for man, that such Desert should die! But who can paint his horrour and surprise, That conflict of outrageous passions shown, When he beheld the lustre leave her eyes, And from her lips the ruby tincture flown? Too well, alas! she her decline conceal'd, He but her wonted delicacy blam'd, Nor dream'd the fatal change, till Death reveal'd; —Vain, false excuse, howe'er by Candour fram'd. By slow advance the strings of life unloos'd, And Beauty gradual sinking to decay, Silent and calm, no arts officious us'd, To all appear'd remote Monimia's day. No sudden change to give the dread alarm, Unless to Friendship's eye, that ne'er survey'd, Or mark'd her temper, or defac'd one charm, Lovely in life's last stage the dying maid. But Oh! one eve, when, to the sad-pleas'd eye, Her gentle sister, Cynthia, rose serene, As if to light her passage to the sky; Monimia fled life's grief-o'erclouded scene. Who would not like Monimia fall asleep, Howe'er affliction clos'd her willing eye; Rather than rush down Fate's tremendous steep, Or in the pomp of wretched greatness, die? She fell, but to announce another's lapse From honour, like a Lucifer of old! She fell, her certain is the world's perhaps, That others might the way to rise behold! She fell, but Virtue saw Monimia's fall, Above a tear, with triumph in her look! She fell, but rais'd in excellence by all, Death gave her more (kind spoiler) than he took! She fell, but not as angels from the skies, Their glory lost for ever to condole! She fell, but with a seraph's wing to rise, Her flight commenc'd when to the grave she stole! So on the polish'd mirrour falls a ray, To rise more splendid on the dazzled sight; So westward sinks the glorious orb of day, That he may rise in pomp of Eastern light. Cease then to boast, thou tyrant of the grave, Whose trophies are the tombs of humankind, Where from oblivion Art affects to save Thy deeds, by epitaphs, and busts reclin'd! Though to the purple canopy of state, Oft flies thy shaft, wing'd by the dread decree; Though humbled oft the mighty and the great, Vaunt not, Monimia triumphs over thee. Nor here let mere Humanity pretend, To claim a compliment, far nobler pass'd; Alas! brought hopeless to our latter end, How unassisted Nature looks aghast! To smoothe the frown on Death's tremendous brow, And blunt the pointed terrours of his sting; Quick at Religion's altar pay the vow, The sole resource, whate'er bold poets sing. Let some to Stoic apathy recur, Others to fine-spun metaphysic schemes; While some at non-existence scarce demur, These are Despair's last shifts, fick Fancy's dreams. Wishes, that mount on Faith's triumphant wings; Hopes, nought less than Eternity can bound; Joy, that but from approving Conscience springs; These are alone our dying cordials found. When lawless Sense has rioted at large Through a long period of licentious joys, As Heav'n can ne'er the mighty debt discharge, Extinction then the horrid thought employs. O shame to Reason! shame to manly Sense! Rank cowardice, and meanness undisguis'd! To live in anxious torture and suspense, Then die like brutes, more wretched, more despis'd! But O, dread arbiter of life and death! Be Faith's firm hold, be Hope's prompt comforts mine! Begun to live, when I resign my breath, Thou my solace, as boundless mercy thine! Thus shall Monimia's fair example live, Approv'd, admir'd, nor imitated less; While Candour would Lorenzo half forgive, Though Justice might the weak design repress. Ye abject sons of tyranny and pride, To horrid doubts whom Jealousy inflames; Hence lay your wretched impious schemes aside, Monimia's tomb your guilt and doom proclaims. Virtue, oft-times, howe'er oppress'd she seems, How few to rescue, though deplor'd by all! Though Folly's eye the angel vanquish'd deems, Survives her death, and triumphs in her fall. Vice, though high swoln in insolence of pow'r, By some with dread beheld, with plaudits some, At best but poorly conquers for an hour, Or in the very conquest is o'ercome. How strove Lorenzo with avow'd intent, To sink her virtues level with his own; But, all his views o'ershot, his malice spent, Behold! an angel still the more she shone. As Night's surrounding darkness deeper glooms, Hushes each warbler, and the view confines; A brighter sparkle ev'ry star assumes, Till all the firmament illumin'd shines. Nor be impartial Justice once impeach'd, Even here Lorenzo meets his righteous doom; By Heav'n's emphatic vengeance quickly reach'd, Conviction's deep remorse, despair, and gloom. With all his anxious efforts to forget, Her injur'd shade still on his view obtrudes; Though studious to avoid, indignant yet, Each fear-ey'd object to her fate alludes. His disappointed hopes, his broken vows, His meanness, cunning, cruelty, and pride; Deep fix in horrour on his down-cast brows, Or whelm his thoughts in one tumultuous tide. But when her merit rises to his view, Her innocence, her unaffected charms, Which, as her woes increas'd, still brighter grew; With keener sting his conscious heart alarms. But hold; the moral hence new force deriv'd, Else had unmark'd Monimia's tyrant pass'd; Though he that angel Excellence surviv'd, His peace departed, when she breath'd her last. Nor scorns the Muse one sacrifice to Truth, Not to her Worth deceas'd he seem'd unjust; Though once o'erlook'd her virtues, charms, and youth, How could he but revere her in—the dust? Doom'd to the pressure of heart-rending grief, In marble what remain'd of her he laid; And, eager to insure a short relief, These lines inscrib'd, a debt which justice paid. But be these lines extorted from his pen, By Worth extorted, on each heart ingrav'd; A caution of no light import to men, One ruin'd, that a thousand may be sav'd. The EPITAPH. Here sleeps, in the still mansion of the grave, What once was comeliness and virtue twain; From death could innocence or beauty save, On Earth's cold lap Monimia had not lain. All that beheld, for ever lov'd to gaze, That heard her, could have listen'd without end; Yet hence was but deriv'd her second praise, Hence, with a form not Fancy's self could mend. For friendship form'd, and all life's social joys, A Friend she sought, but Fate ah disinclin'd! To Heav'n she fled, where Man no more annoys, To seek that treasure, here she ne'er could find. The End of the Elegies. Epitaphs for a MISER. I. [Others press forward haply Heaven to find] Others press forward haply Heaven to find, Alas! the miser leaves his Heaven behind. II. [Reader, survey this monumental pile] Reader, survey this monumental pile, Nor drop a tear of pity all the while. It rose, enjoin'd by will, at mighty cost, For dead, by it, the Miser nothing lost. He died, a victim at the shrine of pelf, Because, alive, he never lov'd himself. He died, like him, Fate ne'er could debt forgive, He died, because he knew not how to live. III. [This letter'd stone, to mortals kind, conceals] This letter'd stone, to mortals kind, conceals A wretch, who from himself no longer steals. Death, in mere spite, for Death despises pelf, Stole the astonish'd miser from himself. Himself his friends still in embraces hold, For (strange) his soul's materializ'd to gold. Hence, as just Heaven to souls precedence gives, Though coffin'd here, his nobler half still lives. Death but destroys the body, not himself, Mankind do more, destroy his soul, his pelf. Thus we the stale philosophy renew, That souls are mortal, and material too. IV. [A Miser died; some gen'rous friend] A Miser died; some gen'rous friend Grac'd with a tomb his latter end, And wrote, “Beneath lies Nathan Drew, “Who kindly left me—this to do.” His heir, one day in passing by, This short inscription chanc'd to spy, And, glancing o'er it with surprise, Exclaim'd, “How much the marble lies!” Shaking his purse (with transport too) “Here, here! (quoth he) lies Nathan Drew.” V. [Here rests, beneath this grassy-border'd stone] Here rests, beneath this grassy-border'd stone, A miser, who made man's chief good his own. Hail marble! thus indulg'd with endless fame, Forgotten else with some faint's half-spelt name; That else had made the Text some Poet's own, When, asking bread, he had receiv'd a stone. VI. [A Miser justly claims these lines ingrav'd] A Miser justly claims these lines ingrav'd, Thus from oblivion, not damnation, sav'd; For He who, by no precepts overaw'd, Worships an idol, for the one true God; He too, Lucretius beck'ning from his shelf, Who with remorseless poniard stabs himself; By Heaven detested, and despis'd by men, May plead forgiveness, if a miser can. VII. [Shrouded beneath this venerable stone] Shrouded beneath this venerable stone, Each day he liv'd more self-denied still grown; Scorning the ease and luxury of pelf, A martyr lies—a martyr to himself. VIII. [This monument, which bears no vulgar name] This monument, which bears no vulgar name, A noted Miser consecrates to fame. Ye patriot band of old! ye glorious few, How often prais'd! now imitated too! Who still, with freedom nothing could conceal, Preferr'd the general to the private weal! Give place—nor your deserts misunderstood, The Miser died, died for the public good. Hail benefactor of the humankind! What blessings thy decease confers behind! For which, through life, each evil was endur'd, And which by death's effectually secur'd. IX. [A Miser rots below this mould'ring stone] A Miser rots below this mould'ring stone, Who starv'd himself, through spleen, to skin and bone, Lest worms might riot on his flesh at last, And boast, what he ne'er could, a full repast. Such still was his propensity to save, Not man alone, he would defraud the grave. But O! could reptiles here in triumph laugh! On earth's devour'd the Miser's better half. X. Epitaph on Mr ADDISON. Under this kind protecting yew A critic lies, and poet too, That is, the rest to Heav'n remov'd, So much of each as mortal prov'd. He, oft as exercis'd his pen, Gave immortality to men. But Death could ne'er his pen forgive, To scorn his pow'r, and make men live. Yet, though unbrandish'd in his hand, It vibrates still at Time's command. Friends Addison and Time thus close, But Death and He relentless foes. Victor and vanquish'd in one breath, Death conquers Him, he conquers Death. Though gone himself, Time ever kind, His great avenger's left behind, Whose dart, mankind amends to make, Will Death himself at length o'ertake. XI. Epitaph for Mr THOMSON's Monument. Could statues speak, no couplet were requir'd, How poets liv'd by all mankind admir'd; But speech deny'd, the letter-titled stone Must tell of Thomson, what to all is known, “With Attic fire that Scotia saw him burn, “His cradle there, in Anglia claim'd his urn.” Others to marble may their glory owe, And boast those honours sculpture can bestow; Short-liv'd renown, that every moment must Sink with its emblem, and consume to dust; But Thomson needs no artist to ingrave, From dumb oblivion no device to save; Such vulgar aids let names inferiour ask, Nature for him assumes herself the task; The Seasons are his monuments of fame, With them to flourish, as from them it came. XII. Epitaph on Sir ? Calm sleeps the mortal part below Of one who never had a foe; A Christian form'd on Reason's plan, A modest saint, an honest man. Whose hands a sceptre might have sway'd, Had Charity not been their trade; Whom robes imperial might have grac'd, Had Folly thought them not well plac'd; His brow with gems had been adorn'd, But Virtue still the baubles scorn'd. To Heav'n be songs of praise begun, For what it gracious has not done. He dy'd, O reader, so may you, For he had nothing else to do. XIII. Epitaph on Dr ? Here—claims the grateful look, Whom Death as his best friend mistook, And therefore suffer'd him to live, Till age itself the stroke did give. Death was beguil'd, since, fond of brothers, He deem'd this doctor just like others. Yet, tyrant, boast; for, poor in pelf, He, saving others, fell himself. Ah! who a recompense can give? Though dead, by him a thousand live. XIV. Epitaph on FANNY ROVER. This tomb-stone covers Fanny Rover, Who often read her pray'r-book over, Yet never thought, till Death stood by, Alas! alas! that she must die. “O save me,” says the clay-pale maid, “Saving,” cries Death, “was ne'er my trade. “Well I believe it,” said the other, “But kindly leave me for another; “O turn your pointed dart away! “O give me but a single day! “Will it diminish aught your pow'r, “To grant the favour of one hour? “Only a moment's respite give, “I'll then, though old, begin to live.” “Life rather should commence at death,” He stern reply'd, and stopt her breath. Virgins, be wise from Fanny Rover, Act not her life, but death-bed over. XV. Epitaph on LUCY HAY. Here lies a senseless lump of clay, That once envelop'd Lucy Hay, Next with the sun-beam, and the show'r, To animate some gentle flow'r; An emblem, not beyond the truth, Of Lucy's blooming charms and youth, Each Season shall see Lucy rise, And all admire her—but the skies; For there a welcome spirit gone, Far other likeness she puts on. To one life Death the stroke did give, But Lucy thus shall doubly live. XVI. Epitaph on a SLANDERER. Here moulders one, not worth a sob, Who all mankind was wont to rob, Not of their watches, or their purses, But of their characters, which worse is. The good he hated (wretched elf) Because the good unlike himself; The good, still bound by Candour's laws, But pity'd him, for the same cause. Kind Death! to bid his tongue be still, Commanding, “thou no more shalt kill;” The slayer I myself have slain, Never to lie but once again, “When to his Saviour he shall kneel, “When saw I thee misfortunes feel, “In prison, naked, or in want, “Nor comfort, food, and raiment grant? “As these ne'er such receiv'd from thee, “Mortal, such ne'er were offer'd me.” XVII. Epitaph on an unhappy young Man. Refrain, officious reader, to inquire What virtues once did the deceas'd inspire? What splendid titles his descent adorn? What station held he? of what parents born? Consign'd to dust, nought it avails thee, now, To be instructed, whither, whence, or how, He came—he liv'd—is gone—these to conceal, Kind Death o'er all has spread his friendly veil. Your curious search let this inscription bound, On monumental marbles seldom found, For seldom Truth the scuptor's chissel tries, A hapless youth here in oblivion lies, Who sinn'd—so have the worthiest and the best, His God and Saviour only know the rest. Whether, O reader, more desert thy share, And fewer faults, thy tomb-stone will declare. XVIII. Epitaph on a BEGGAR. Some of their ancestors talk loud, Of ancient blood absurdly proud; But I can call, nor make a pother, Adam my sire, and Eve my mother. Some fam'lies up a cent'ry run, But mine commenc'd when time begun. Beggars are then as good as others, Monarchs and peers themselves but—brothers. XIX. My own Epitaph. Let the false marble tell no pompous lie, In admonition hush'd the flatt'ring strain; “Rightly to live, is learning how to die; “And dying well, is but to live again.” A REVERY. Written in the gloomy Recess of a Wood. The Muses here with Melancholy meet, Whose looks relax'd a solemn smile dispense; Something like sorrow, though divinely sweet, Here gently steals on the half-conscious sense. The soften'd scenery of declining day, With clouds of fleecy gold o'erspread the sky, All earth serene beneath the parting ray, Who thoughtful e'er beheld, without a sigh? That sigh, no tribute of unmanly wo, Affords a proof beyond the ethic page, That, to conceive the beautiful below, And to enjoy, transcends the deepest sage. Hence too that sigh prophetic to the wise, Of death, when souls their utmost pow'rs enlarge; That man immortal's destin'd to the skies, When Fate all-gracious gives the kind discharge. Here, no loud clamours of officious Care, With quick return, upon the ear obtrude; Scarce mov'd is the surrounding depth of air, Far distant the approach of footstep rude. Imagination hence her wing extends, Beyond the narrow flight of vulgar thought; The heart with transport beats while she ascends, Yet whence each quick sensation, idly sought. With eye elate of rapture and surprise, Maria each scene, enhanc'd by Eve, surveys; But, though each look a strange delight implies, Would she describe it? language disobeys. The springs of transport exquisitely fram'd, Nature by magic moves, unknown, though felt; From Heav'n some secret sudden impulse aim'd, For eyes suffus'd to flow, and hearts to melt. Whether some silent intercourse between Congenial spirits, on some kind design; Pure intellectual hints exchang'd unseen, Mistakes and errours still our search confine. Without the intervention of the sense, The apparatus of organic parts, That human souls can feel, and feel intense, Reason denies not strictly, nor asserts. What modes of feeling, consciousness, sense, thought, Volition, knowledge, loco-motive pow'rs, With Immaterials reign, are vainly sought, Howe'er sublime Conjecture's pinion tow'rs. Nor less perplex'd the anxious human guess, Whether with man Celestials converse hold, By means ineffable, thus to impress Strong proofs of future glories to unfold. Dreams, when the soul seems to exist apart From body, motionless, and almost dead, Save merely the mechanic-beating heart, Here throw some light through darkness thickly spread. When Sleep's strong opiate seals the passive eye, How disengag'd from flesh the Spirit soars! With angels, its associates from the sky, How, quick as thought, all nature it explores! Time's intervals, and distances of space, Vainly would interrupt her magic range; Enormous mountains give, like molehills, place, And oceans to mere brooks before her change. Howe'er in mazes infinite involv'd, Souls hence their native dignity assert, And independence (else much doubt unsolv'd) On matter stupid, lifeless, and inert. But lest our farther search misunderstood, Maria, thus far the grave dull verse excuse; Yet Maria oft delights, in pensive mood, To share retirement with the moral Muse; And thus, with philosophic cast of thought, Her sex's endless levity condemns; By empty forms, and senseless sounds uncaught, The wave of feathers, and the blaze of gems. Try'd by a taste so polish'd and sublime, Far more than vulgar joys Retirement claims; When only Wisdom grieves the lapse of time, And no wish envies what Reflection blames. Such the calm genial season, to arrive At somewhat diadems can ne'er bestow, Though ne'er on Parian marble to survive, That inward sunshine Vice despairs to know. When the fond Soul within herself retires, A little world proud Cæsar ne'er possess'd; Feels the ecstatic glow of her own fires, And feasts on pleasures language ne'er express'd. Say, Maria, what mysterious Pow'r unseen Acts here? or is it wayward Fancy dreams? No; Nature here would, by sensations keen, Awake the soul to great and godlike themes. Without its cares, its sorrows, and its strife, Reason would here all mankind should be taught, To form a proper estimate of life, A lesson by no dear experience bought. Virtue would here, as by ethereal fire, Touch ev'ry string that vibrates to the heart; Pity would here with her big woes inspire, That kindred souls disjoin, and friends dispart. For what sad eye can glance o'er humankind, Or the wide world's extensive map survey, Nor, with the pang of an ingenuous mind, The frequent debt of manly sorrow pay? Life's wide horizon one vast cloud o'erspreads, Through which but seldom shines a kindly ray; Yon diamonds, that encircle royal heads, Sparkle so bright, for absent is the day. Spring clothes the Tulip in her fairest garb, A blast may her of beauty soon despoil; Winter disrobes her, like the meanest herb, Nor knows the florist where she grac'd the soil. So, youth warm blushes in the virgin's cheek, But soon these conscious blushes charm no more; Death, whose untimely visit oft we seek, Bids Beauty give all her vain triumph o'er. But boast not, grave, exult not, tyrant Death, The soul your utmost reach of pow'r defies; Your icy hand may stop the fleeting breath, But not detain the spirit from the skies. Happy! howe'er vain Fortune's wheel turns round, Whatever ill on man still presses hard; Wisdom will ever with success be crown'd, And Virtue prove her own sublime reward! Description of the FACE. Addressed to MARIA. Nature's more perfect workmanship we trace, And beautiful contrivance, in the face. It exquisite she wrought, without allay, To a consistence of the softest clay; Surrounded it with graceful shades of hair, To render every feature doubly fair, Set off each mellow'd beauty to the sight, In all the soft varieties of light; With curious organs furnish'd it around, To relish all the softer modes of sound; Made it the seat of love's inchanting wiles, Of artless dimples, languishments, and smiles, Graces and airs, and blushes, all design'd To mark the tender bias of the mind. She gave a waxen polish to the skin, The sky-blue veins transparent from within; Rais'd the smooth forehead, set the brows apart, Thrown into arches with surpassing art; Touch'd with her pencil, of Carminian dip, The health-plump cheek and nectar-humid lip; Bade the full eye revolve its lucid ball, To cast a mild effulgence over all, To light up every feature, and display A countenance, like Maria's, ever gay; Maria's that can ineffably impart The softest passions to the feeling heart; Make every bosom, by some secret charm, Thrill with delight, and beat a sweet alarm. Nor of itself alone: with graceful ease Virtue by it exerts her power to please. Each glance, each movement she adopts, and then Would represent them as her own to men. Nor can the eye, howe'er exact, pretend To mark where doth the nice resemblance end. Not vainly then the lovely portrait made, Not vainly Nature's plastic skill display'd. To her, by this her image so endu'd, What adoration's paid, what rites renew'd! Nigh on the bended knee of silent awe, What votive crouds in quick succession draw Hands lifted up, and eyes to Heaven erect, In all the ostentation of respect! While other ardent worshippers in turn, Their flaming incense on her altars burn; Or offer up, in censers at her shrine, Their fervent adulations half divine. But kept we mediocrity in view, Men would be men, nor women lose their due; More reason then had females to be vain, Though ne'er address'd in the seraphic strain. What mighty conquests oft a beauteous face Gains o'er the bravest of the human race! Not more could Rome's imperial victor boast, Though his proud trophies grac'd each warlike coast. What the bold hero scarcely can perform, Though battles won, and cities sack'd by storm, A smile's effusive sunshine can effect, An eye's moist twinkle, or a look direct. Women, whate'er disparaging we say, Maintain o'er man a more than regal sway. Kings have the pow'r to influence our knee, But though o'eraw'd it bends, our hearts are free. Not so, if Beauty challenge our respect, Our knees express then what our hearts direct. Knew women each advantage they enjoy, And it as Nature dictates would employ, That manner which the most aware beguiles, Those magazines of glances and of smiles, Darts lightning-wing'd, not those indulg'd to crowns, With all their dread artillery of frowns; What numbers, their appointed doom to meet, Would fall like vanquish'd heroes at their feet! As by a look made captive, mute deplor'd, So by a look to Liberty restor'd. Some kill by daggers, by the bullet some, Others by poison Fate's dread prize become, On racks expire whole multitudes; but still, Save women, none by words and glances kill. Thus Nature wisely knowing, that at length The rougher sex, presuming on their strength, Would triumph o'er the gentler female race, For strength gave women beauty in its place. Nor this alone; but order'd Virtue too, And Modesty, if led to public view, To wait on Beauty with obsequious care, And be the constant guardians of the fair. Hence, both equality of power possess, Or, if unlike, the man's accounted less; For art discovers how mere strength to fly, But not the love-beam'd lightning of the eye. But yet Discretion must, with steady eyes, Take the sure aim, and mark the lawful prize; Else will the useless apparatus fail, No force subdue, no artifice prevail. Let then the female world from Maria learn, Each her precise advantage to discern, Her motive, place, her time, her object know, Nor further than these authorise her go. Hence Maria conquers oft'ner with a glance, Or transient smile, as if by perfect chance, Than Daphne with her every art display'd, Her every charm to catch subservient made. Hence in her end soon Maria's prospects o'er, But Daphne's never—till she be threescore. No epithet of vain hence Maria gains, Though Daphne scarce another term obtains. Hence too, though Daphne's spring of beauty past, Fresh and unsully'd still shall Maria's last. O! could I gain fair Maria to my arms, In all her bloom of self-reflected charms; In all those soft attractions, that conspire At once to raise and to correct desire; Daphne should scarce my slightest thought employ, To wound my peace, or interrupt my joy. Written in an Arbour at the foot of a Garden. Time, Morning. Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus, ac fugit urbes. Hor. Here the wide orchard's bending branches meet, Loading the zephyr's aromatic wing With each soft odour, each ambrosial sweet, That fruit affords, or blossoms in the Spring. From hence, a long inclosure leads you o'er A carpet wove in Summer's softest loom, Embroider'd with fresh flow'rs, a copious store, To a vast solemn wood's majestic gloom. Deep in the green retirements of the shade, The tenants of the air their concerts hold, When on the eye the glimm'ring landscapes fade, Or when Aurora streaks the clouds with gold: While, standing tip-toe on each airy hill, Or sitting in her vocal caves around, Echo, exerting all her mimic skill, Gives note for note, and answers sound for sound. This terminates in a wide view of fields, With cottages and villas interspers'd, Where Autumn still the golden treasure yields, And peasants dwell in rural labours vers'd. Hail, ye inspiring groves! ye pensive shades! Ye rising hills! ye gently-sinking vales! Ye limpid fountains, rills, and sunny glades! Ye cooing doves! ye incense-wafting gales! Hail, ye responsive grots, and tuneful birds! Ye verdant landscapes, and extended views! Ye shepherds, fleecy flocks, and lowing herds! Form'd not less to instruct us, than amuse! He that contemplates Nature, learns the art Of growing wise, beyond mere common men; To form the taste, and meliorate the heart, Without her aid, is more than mortals can. Happy for us, did we the just result Of simple, obvious, plain experience know, Which lies not hid in sciences occult, Superiour to our reason—nor below! What charming period can with Morn compare, In smiles yet soften'd Noon's effulgent blush! How mild the breeze! how fragrant is the air! How melody inchants us from each bush! Where is the heart, to grateful feelings sear'd, The breast, against each soft sensation steel'd, Hard as the tyger's, in wild deserts rear'd, Whom hunger prompts to range the sanguin'd field; Where is the tongue, like Winter's icy skies, To ev'ry exquisite sensation cold; When songs of praise and swelling anthems rise, Would its according tribute dare with-hold? This sweet sequester'd spot, this lone recess, Not for the palace would the Muse exchange; The oft'ner we retire, we sin the less, Vice stalks the royal dome with licens'd range. The laurel blooming on the victor's brow, The gem that sparkles on the monarch's crown, At this important, this endearing now, Fades on the eye, or melts like dew-drops down. At such an hour of tranquil, bosom-ease, How Fancy stretches her excursive wing! How ev'ry object seems intent to please! Before her darted glance what Edens spring! How, ravish'd, to yon solar worlds she flies, And wanders o'er a shining tract of stars; Undazzled bears their splendours on her eyes, Or mounts the axle of their burnish'd cars! Struck with the high original of Man, For whom such bodies roll stupendous round, Consistent with the grand Contriver's plan, Diffusing light to nations without bound! Thus breaking forth in ecstasy of praise, “Hail, King eternal! hail, Essential Good! “Jehovah! Lord! Ancient sublime of days! “How little thy dread essence understood! “This ample, superb, this resplendent arch, “How pregnant with august displays of Thee! “Pregnant, beyond the nicest human search, “Where thought can pierce, or telescope can see.” And when for Earth she quits her starry range, What kindred beauties in succession rise! Charming vicissitude! delightful change! The earth no vulgar emblem of the Skies. But still, the charms of structure, colour, size, Attract mankind, (what elegant as they?) Not merely to astonish and surprise, But useful truths, and noblest hints convey. Morning, for this, with rosy hand unbars The glowing portals of the eastern skies; While Heav'n's blue vault no longer shines with stars, That grace the silver Moon's effulgent rise. Obscurely mantled in her sable robe, For this still Night her jasper throne ascends, And scatters poppies round a tranquil globe, While man in Sleep's soft arms his toil suspends. For this, those elms in verdant state ascend, Semblance of true ambition, to the skies; Those honey-suckles their soft twists extend, Emblem of faithful Friendship's sacred ties. How charming is the umbrage these compose, With osiers, ivy, and espaliers mix'd! Whose still deep calm seems to resemble those, Whose minds serene, whose purposes are fix'd. Here may we study the historic page, Converse with thousands many ages dead; The conquerour, the statesman, and the sage, Acquiring knowledge at the fountain-head. In what a glorious light will such appear, As bravely fought when Liberty inspir'd! Control'd the Tyrant in his mad career, By Patriotism's gen'rous ardours fir'd! How charming here to paint the sylvan scene, With Hervey, or the deep sequester'd shade; Paint the vermilion'd morn, or eve serene, The fretted grotto, or abrupt cascade! Or, when the landscape fades upon the eye, And Night o'er all her raven mantle throws; With him to read the lectures of the sky, Where ev'ry orb big with instruction glows. Or, with an eye of scrutiny exact, The human structure curiously survey; Each slender nerve, each nice-form'd tube inspect, What half so exquisitely form'd as they? Nor fail to wander through the featur'd mind, Each thought examine, and each motive scan, Which, as averse to Virtue, or inclin'd, Prove what an angel, or a fiend, is man. Young next might paint that most tremendous scene, When from their beds of dust mankind shall rise, With troubled aspect, or with brow serene, To meet the mighty Judge of earth and skies. Whether they fill'd a throne, in purple dress'd, Circled by slaves on prostituted knee; Or, only of the lowly crook possess'd, Tended their flocks along the heathy lea. Or, like some seraph, tune the midnight-song, While solemn, deep, portentous silence reigns: Sublimely-soaring bard, to whom belong Virrue's own feelings, sentiments, and lays! With Sherlock too, how pleasing to retire Among the letter'd tomb-stones of the dead! Gaze—read—pause—sigh and rev'rently inquire, Not dumb with anguish, but devoutly glad. Upon the grave the more we calmly think, And make the shroud familiar to our view, In Death's cold arms less fearful shall we sink, And bid Life's empty vanities adieu. This moment we inspire the vital breath, Taste all those pleasures Youth or Health can give; The next, resign it at the call of death, Then truly born, eternally to live. If Virtue in her paths their footsteps led, If lively Faith beam'd in their closing eyes; If bless'd Religion smooth'd their dying bed, They fled but to their mansion in the skies. But if (O Charity! forgive the thought) Through Errour's devious tracts they heedless stray'd, Blind votaries to Vice; then they were caught From earth, lest their demerit blacker made. Here too immur'd, how pleasing to forget That Vice and Errour lord it o'er mankind! That Virtue has not learn'd to triumph yet, Nor amongst thousands one true friend can find! How pleasing to forget, that Merit pines In poverty and scorn, while titled Pride, In palaces, with mean Corruption, shines, By Flattery courted, and with envy ey'd! Their chance of Heav'n men barter for a place, That breach of modes, not laws, provokes offence! That Nature gives to Affectation place, And Impudence supplies the room of sense! As serpents wise, not harmless as the dove, That only Goodness mankind never charms! That Gold usurps the tender rights of Love, Beauty condemn'd to mercenary arms! That Friendship's a mere sound, that nothing means But self, poor niggard self, in smooth disguise! That, while on Pity's breast Misfortune leans, She falls, her stay withdrawn, no more to rise! That now Religion little else imports, But sleeping sound, or ogling, in a pew! That Adoration now-a-days resorts But to the play, assembly, or the stew! Come then, Forgetfulness, whose magic pow'r Things quick to non-existence can command; Come, fit companion for the silent hour, When thought distracts, or ghosts before us stand, But oft as this delightful gloom inspires The virtuous, tender, manly, gen'rous thought, Which, while the heart it betters, never tires, Away, by forlorn anxious lovers sought. To Miss J?y ? J?y was once the sweetest maid That grac'd the sprightly dance; The air how artless she display'd! How innocent each glance! But when the senseless fopling tribe Around her airy tript, And, J?y's beauties to describe, Their pens in flattery dipt; Then all the little shifts of Art Were practis'd o'er and o'er, To do, prepost'rously expert, What Nature did before. She still will admiration raise, Who from its gaze withdraws; To seem insensible of praise, Is to deserve applause. Let not a compliment, that owes Its merit to a lie, More kind the censure of your foes, Gain strength by your reply. Let no vain, prattling, tinseld youth, Pert, ignorant, and raw, Who but, when silent, tells the truth, Your kind attention draw. The poor expedients us'd by Art, Like the cheek's borrow'd dye, Can never fix the wise man's heart, Though they may catch his eye. Your truest graces Virtue sums, In gentle, soft, and meek; Disdain, or pride, but ill becomes The dimply virgin cheek. Let J?y then assume that ease Which charm'd the world before; The less she anxious strives to please, She still will please the more. Of self-complacence O beware! O listen not to some men, Who call you most divinely fair, But wish you less than woman! And O forgive the bard, the while Such maxims he lays down; Though he may J?y wish to smile, He can survive her frown. To Miss Annie Hamilton. Tir'd of the city's splendid shows, Almira to the country goes; Happy from noise, sedans, and coaches, As some pale meagre lord approaches; From dirty lanes, and crouded streets, Where villain oft with villain meets; From bows and curtseys, without number, And compliments that but encumber; From routs and drums, and midnight revels, The import of our modern travels; From smoke in many a stagnate wreath, And vapours that diseases breathe; From this strange group which some admire, Happy, thrice happy, to retire; To feel the cheek with heat suffus'd, By walks and exercise amus'd; To suck in health, through rustling trees, From many an odour-wafting breeze; To taste those pleasures Silence gives, To her denied in crouds that lives: Not with much recollection vain, That swells regret, and creates pain, Of town amusements, show, and pomp, Made for the fop, coquet, and romp; Like some the conscious verse might name, Did it not wound the sex's fame. Nor would Ardelia wish to share, A fit example to the fair, A compliment, by her ingross'd Invidious at the sex's cost. To a Lady offended at seeing her Verses printed, on account of their being too simple. You still, my fair, prepost'rously complain, Your verses are too simple and too plain, When, if you mind the critically wise, Their very beauty in their plainness lies; As lilies charm in plain and simple white, But, daub'd with vermile, would disgust the sight; As the false cheek's vile artificial flush Can never pass for Nature's roseate blush. How easy to throw off the tumid phrase, And interlard with epithets the lays! But the parade of florid words confounds, And sentiment is lost in pomp of sounds: As the fresh landscape's vivid green looks pale, When noon's strong light and scorching heats prevail. If suited to the circumstance, and place, Simplicity is woman's truest grace. When thoughtless females the reverse prefer, From Nature they depart, and always err. Mere Affectation vainly would assert A steady, lasting empire o'er the heart. Let then, if you expect to be a wife, Your numbers be an emblem of your life; Thus, rather than complain with captious voice, You may have cause to triumph and rejoice. On the Death of Mr Allan Ramsay This was forgot to be inserted among the Elegies.. Written in the year 1758. Hard by the grassy margin of a stream, Where zephyrs play'd to cool the sultry beam, Shedding, conglob'd anon, the vapoury dew, Or Spring's rich fragrance, from their pinions blue; Just as the sun from noontide height declin'd, And through the op'ning trees obliquely shin'd; A shepherd rested on the flowery ground, By distant rows of elms encompass'd round. Pure was his bosom as the stream that flow'd, Or eastern gale that o'er its surface blow'd. Gentle his temper as the lenient flow'r, That spreads its folds to catch the moist'ning show'r. Pleas'd and contented with his humble lot, His thoughts ne'er soar'd above the crook or cot. Oft would he softly swell the mellow reed, Bathe in the flood, or view his lambkins feed; With simple footstep trip the green along, Or make lone echoes vocal with his song; Select rich nosegays, elegantly drest, To fill, but not adorn, his charmer's breast: Oft studious pore o'er some fam'd past'ral book, His plaid thrown by, his flagellet, and crook; Where rustic love-scenes harmlessly conspire To melt the tender heart, and fancy fire; Truth and Simplicity unletter'd shine, And Innocence embellishes each line. Above the rest the Gentle Shepherd charm'd, With hopes and fears alternately alarm'd, While Patie and while Peggy met to woo, Almost, so strong the paint, confess'd to view; With rolling eyes on one another turn'd, Glancing those fires that in their bosoms burn'd. Not the soft odours that in violets dwell, Not the bland honey from the waxen cell; Not the mild fannings of the southern breeze, That stir to sighs the not unconscious trees; Not Philomel, first minstrel of the grove, Warbling in yonder jes'mine-wreath'd alcove; Not the sweet murmur of descending rills, Nor low-breath'd coo of fir-immantled hills; With more of nature exquisitely please The elegant, chaste taste, and thought at ease. Such traces the fond numbers leave behind, Such power have fine descriptions o'er the mind; Oft to some oak would he his speech address, In equal warmth his passion to express, And still, as oft as breezes fann'd the trees, Fondly concludes an answer he receives: Till conquer'd by imaginary charms, Around the trunk he clasps his eager arms, And, ere his eyes the strange mistake can see, Imprints warm kisses on the lifeless tree. Once, as he sat beneath an aged thorn, To breathe the dewy freshness of the morn; His ear attentive to the blackbird's lay, Or tuneful thrush, perch'd on a neighb'ring spray; A swain, slowly approaching, he espies, With his spread hand oft lifted to his eyes; Whose downcast looks seem to implore relief, As if oppress'd with some o'erwhelming grief. Touch'd with the sudden sympathy of wo, Yet apprehensive the event to know; While mix'd surmises all his mind possess, And various reasons offer to his guess, Near him with trembling step the shepherd draws, Eager to ask the melancholy cause: But all the answer his inquiry gains, Which yet, alas! too well his grief explains, These few short, but emphatic, words exprest, Ramsay is dead—his silence told the rest. Advice to a LADY, On an Offer of Marriage. Take my advice, without delay, It will prevent a world of sorrow; What wisely can be done to-day, Defer not vainly till to-morrow. Thus, when the ivy would invest Its kindred tree, if aught divides, That branch no more for ever prest, Hence quickly disengag'd it slides. To ? [Learn a plain lesson from a friend] Learn a plain lesson from a friend, Sway'd by no mercenary end; Never to gratify your wit, Howe'er by fools admir'd for it, Your pride, your knowledge, learning, sense, At blushing Modesty's expense; Nor, which the worst of tempers shows, Your neighbour's venial slips expose. The truest wisdom is, to know That none are perfect here below; The noblest candour, to conceal What Malice only would reveal. To ? [If you by all would be belov'd] If you by all would be belov'd, By bad men fear'd, by good approv'd, And live exempt from blame; O Envy's summons disobey, That unrelenting bird of prey Which lives on blasted fame! To others' merit be not blind, In manners, person, birth, or mind; Thus you, admiring, may Assume (a worthy, decent pride, To candour, taste, and sense allied) That compliment you pay. He who still labours all he can, To leave the common herd of men, By promptness to oblige; Him, nor Detraction's poison'd darts, Malice, with all her hellish arts, Nor Want, shall e'er besiege. A Sketch of NOON. The Sun, with radiant splendours in his eye, Swift roll'd his fiery chariot up the sky; And as to zenith altitude he rose, Bright and more bright his dazzling visage glows; Till, all-refulgent from meridian height, He pours a flood of glory on the sight. Through Nature's depths the mighty radiance felt, Earth seems to smoke, and rocks themselves to melt; A sickly hue spreads o'er the verdant glade, And all the landscape's laughing beauties fade; The languid flow'r reclines its drooping head, Its fragrant sweets, its deep vermilion fled; Ev'n Industry, while the strong beam descends, Faint and relax'd, her half-done task suspends, And, underneath some lofty range of trees, Sucks in the vital coolness of the breeze; The flocks and herds to shelt'ring glooms retreat, Weary and panting with oppressive heat; While stretch'd, unactive, on the parch'd-up ground, His pipe, his crook, his garland, strew'd around; The sun-burnt shepherd's yielding eyelids close, And all his senses sink in bland repose: Silent as death are now the warbling throng, Not Love itself inspires their various song; All seek the closest covert of the wood, Or in cool haunts pick up their scanty food; Echo too, dormant in her marble grot, Has half her arts of mimicry forgot; Ev'n heat-enamour'd swallows quit the air, And, silent, to their mud-built nests repair: Nothing is heard but the dull hum of bees, Or insects buzzing through the blossom'd trees; The chirp of grasshopper amid the brake, Or sleep-inviting tinkle of the lake; Nature herself grows faint, with warmth opprest, And all Creation sinks supine to rest. Happy the youth, by no false taste betray'd, Whom Contemplation leads now to the shade; Who, unseduc'd by the vile love of pelf, Can courts despise, and venerate himself; Of more than crowns possess'd, while he can roam Through Nature's works, nor ever be from home; The systems of our earth, and yonder skies, Glories hid, haply, from the monarch's eyes; Eternal Wisdom's exquisite display, While heav'n-born Newton leads the radiant way; Calls forth fair order, harmony, and light, From the dark womb of anarchy and night! Thus, for one paltry kingdom, one poor spot Almost in Nature's boundless scenes forgot, Without the gilded gewgaw of a throne, A thousand he may amply call his own. FINIS</field>
