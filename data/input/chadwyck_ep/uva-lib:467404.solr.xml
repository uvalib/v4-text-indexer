      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. ON THE STATUE OF EBENEZER ELLIOTT BY NEVILLE BURNARD, ORDERED BY THE WORKING MEN OF SHEFFIELD. Reprinted by permission of Messrs. Chapman and Hall. By Walter Savage Landor. Glory to those who give it! who erect The bronze and marble, not where frothy tongue Or bloody hand points out—no, but where God Ordains the humble to walk forth before The humble, and mount higher than the high. Wisely, O Sheffield, wisely hast thou done To place thy Elliott on the plinth of fame; Wisely hast chosen for that solemn deed One like himself, born where no mother's love Wrapt purple round him, nor rang golden bell, Pendant from Libyan coral, in his ear, To catch a smile or calm a petulance; Nor tickled downy scalp with Belgic lace; But whom strong genius took from poverty, And said, Rise, mother, and behold thy child! She rose, and Pride rose with her but was mute. Three Elliotts there have been, three glorious men, Each in his generation. One was doom'd By despotism and prelacy to pine In the damp dungeon, and to die for Law, Rack'd by slow tortures ere he reacht the grave. See Forster's “Statesmen of the Commonwealth.” A second hurled his thunderbolt and flame When Gaul and Spaniard moor'd their pinnaces, Screaming defiance at Gibraltar's frown, Until one moment more, and other screams, And other writhings rose above the wave From sails afire and hissing where they fell, And men half burnt along the buoyant mast. A third came calmly on and askt the rich To give laborious hunger daily bread, As they in childhood had been taught to pray By God's own Son, and sometimes have prayed since. God heard; but they heard not. God sent down bread; They took it, kept it all, and cried for more, Hollowing both hands to catch and clutch the crumbs. I may not live to hear another voice, Elliott, of power to penetrate as thine, Dense multitudes; another none may see, Leading the muses from unthrifty shades, To fields where corn gladdens the heart of man, And where the trumpet with defiant blast Blows in the face of war and yields to peace. Therefor take thou these leaves, fresh, firm, tho' scant,— To crown the City that crowns thee her son. She must decay: Toledo hath decaid; Ebro hath half forgotten what bright arms Flasht on his waters; what high dames adorn'd The baldric; what torn flags o'erhung the aile; What parting gift the ransom'd knight exchanged. But louder than the anvil rings the lyre; And thine hath raised another City's wall In solid strength to a proud eminence, Which neither conqueror, crushing braver men, Nor time, o'ercoming conquerer, can destroy. So now, ennobled by thy birth, to thee She lifts with pious love the thoughtful stone. Genius is tired in search of gratitude; Here they have met; may neither say farewell. JUVENILE POEMS. Extract from “The Vernal Walk,” written in the Author's Seventeenth Year. Oh, Thou that sway'st the boundless universe! King of illimitable empire! hear My trembling voice of praise. I know Thou art; But when my soul would raise her eyes to Thee, Vainly I try to grasp so vast a view; For in thy half-reveal'd sublimity, Holding the reins of universal rule, Thou sitt'st invisible upon the throne Of universal nature, and behold'st A vast immensity, fill'd by Thyself. Spirit of spirits! ere the eagle flew, Ere the worm crawl'd, ere sang the love-taught wren, Or man, erect, before Thee stood and smiled, Thou hadst existed an eternity Of thoughtful ages: ere there lived one soul To worship thee, oh, God of Holiness! Wrapt in incomprehensibility, Pleased with self-contemplation, Thou didst muse In silence on thine own eternal thoughts. Through all extent Thou piercest; nothing is Where Thou art not; even in me Thou dwell'st. Thou mov'st the strings of mental melody Which tune my soul to harmony and love. Thou bid'st my fancy soar to realms of light, Bid'st reason—holy reason—muse on Thee And in thy works behold Thee, throned o'er heights And depths of glory inaccessible. I, in the majesty of nature, see The greatness of eternal Majesty; I, in her smiling scenery, behold The bounteous smile of beauty infinite. Thy goodness is unbounded, God of Love! Here—or wherever Uncreated Light Flames of the sea of ever-vital beams World-peopled, as this vernal air with birds— Father and God! thy sons shall worship Thee! MIRANION. Why shouts Quebec? Why rolls from all her towers The peal of gladness, through the midnight air, O'er moving crowds? Why do her casements blaze, Her torches flash, in lines of restless light? Great Montcalm is return'd with victory, And moves in triumph through her blazing streets. Before him glide Canadian maids, white-robed— War-widow'd virgins, on whose pensive cheeks The blush of health had faded into snow. Life, life, how heav'nly graceful are thy forms, In joy or sorrow! Soft as sleep they move, High-waving o'er their heads the spotless lawn, And scattering roses at his proud steed's feet. Quebec pours forth her people, young and old, To see again her great deliverer. The war-unchilded mother, and the boy Whose sire had fall'n in battle, came abroad; Even the friendless, aged, houseless man Cast on his ruin'd dwelling, as he pass'd, But one brief glance, then, dancing with the young, Follow'd the glad procession and rejoiced. The soldier's widow sought the crowded streets; Oh, deem not that her true heart could forget Her low-laid husband! No! with mournful smiles She thought of him and wept; but while she view'd The glittering scene, those sad smiles seem'd to say, “And he, too, was a soldier.” Did not, then, Love-lorn Miranion of the down-cast eye Steal to the lattice of her tower to gaze? She (stately nun! angelic exile! torn From nature's bosom!) on the various throng Look'd pale and anxious. Soon again she saw, Herself unseen, yet mute and timidly, Though with energic pensiveness, the lord Of her affections, Montcalm. Loftier seem'd His martial beauty, darker his large eye, With triumph fired; and god-like headvanced, To redivorce her vows. Unhappy maid! Why was she born? All-ignorant is he What cause he hath to feel ennobling pride— Miranion loves him! but he knows it not. He reins his foamy steed; the mighty crowd Halts, and is hush'd, and living statues hold Unnumber'd torches still! She sees no torch, She sees no crowd, her eyes are fix'd on him. He waves his hand, he bows in act to speak; Forward she bends; she listens motionless; Hangs on his lips, and breathless drinks his speech, As if the words that should pronounce her death, Quiver'd for awful utterance on his tongue. “France is victorious; Ever fortunate! She, mistress of the nations, shall extend The limits of her sway. Columbia spreads The verdure of unbounded wilds, and rolls Her rivers rivalless, to load with wealth Our noble country; and the vanquish'd seas Shall bound her greatness with their amplitude; For England, like a wintry sun, descends, Nor shall the sloping orb, return'd, arise Again to glory. Laud the Lord of Hosts! The maple, and the monarch of the woods, Magnolia, now in praise lift up their hands, To measureless Missouri's serpent folds. I see the unborn glory of this land— Her sons, high-destined, her immortal men, The stately children of futurity. Laud, then, the God of Battles, my loved friends! Calamity hath worn you, war hath sown Your streets with woe; but better days approach. Go to your homes, and to your little ones Say—Ruin hath stalk'd near us, with a frown That awed, but blasted not—the storm is past.” So said he, hapless in his prophecy, And, from the throng retiring, sought repose. Then, as a catacomb's vast silence, soon The living scene was hush'd; a silent crowd, A peopled solitude—the city slept. Time ever moves, the only traveller That tires not, rests not; dilatory man May loiter and may pause; Time pauses not. How fast his wings have swept away the hours! And lo! 'tis come! The important hour is come That shall make children fatherless, and dash Into despair the confident hope of pride! Thou, Quebec, sleepest! and thy warrior sons, In visions, see the host of England worn With famine, and subdued without a blow. But that unconquer'd host abjures repose, Crowds every boat, and glides, inaudibly, Down the dark river. Wake, proud city, crest Thy rocks with thunder, while they yet are thine! Night hears the bat and owlet flit and swim Over funereal forests, all asleep; And mighty rivers, and lakes ocean-like— That gaudily deck th' eternal wilderness, And round the virgin waist of solitude, Enamour'd, twine their long and beauteous arms— Slumber beneath innumerable stars. The snow-white porpoise, rising, starts to hear The prow-divided wave. How sweet, O night, Thy chaste and unperturb'd sublimity! Yet, on the shaded river, many a heart Aches, as the British boats, with muffled oars, Glide with the stream. Of England's happy fields Thinks the doom'd soldier, mute—of friends and home— Of love and quiet—and the parting look, Engraven on his heart—of weeping wife— Oh! never more around his neck to clasp Her arms, or lift his babes to kiss their sire. Amid the silent faces, there is one Most thoughtful. O'er the stern he leans in thought, Where, thro' the glimmering waves, gleams many a face Of slaughtered warrior, peaceful in his tomb Of waters; for, tho' heaven's bright queen towers not Above the mountains; yet, the clouds which wreath Their highest cliffs, tinged with her mildest beams, Are visible in magic forms of shade And brightness; and their edges, silver-fringed, Tremble, reflected on the glassy stream. The shrouded heavens, the solemn hour, the vast River, the rocks enormous, plumed with pines, That cast their calm shades o'er the gliding wave, Bend to stern sadness Wolfe's o'er-wearied mind. Ah! soon the battle-crash shall wake their shades, And bid their echoes howl; hurl o'er their rocks The slayer and the slain, and dye with gore This silent, solemn, loneliest, loveliest scene! The rocks frown'd darker o'er the shoreward fleet. First on the strand stood Wolfe. Boat followed boat, And warrior warrior. With uplifted sword He pointed to the rocks; and swift, and strong, And resolute, they scaled the steepness there. Silent, and each assisting each, they rose From tree to tree, from cliff to cliff; and soon, High on the summit, twenty veterans waved Their Highland blades. Mute thousands follow'd them, With labour infinite, and cautious tread, And breathing, half-suppress'd; and painfully Their slaught'ring cannon weigh'd from pine to pine. Still dost thou sleep, proud city, unalarm'd! Hush'd are thy streets; and by the warrior's bed The sword is idle; and of peace restored The matron dreaming, sees her sons unscrew The rifle, and release the useless helm. But pale Miranion wakes. She, love-lorn maid, Hath stolen to the heights, unseen, unheard, Alone, to hear the river, far below, Murmur unseen; and to indulge fond thoughts, Sweet wishes, fond and vain. O'er the grey rock She bends her drooping beauty, and she thinks How sweetly, pillow'd on his bronzèd breast, The peasant's wife is sleeping from her toils; How well it were to be a soldier's bride, And couch with love and danger! Holy maid! What if thou doff thy veil, in man's attire To stand by Montcalm's side, a seemly page? But virgin fear, and virgin modesty, Chased that wild thought at once; a painful heat Rush'd to the cheek, which never erst the blush Of guilty shame suffused; and “Oh!” she said, “My God, forgive me! O forgive thy child! Support me! strengthen me! or let cold earth Wrap poor Miranion's bosom, and the tears Of pious sisters mourn a sinless maid!” Her eyes are red with weeping; on her hand Her moisten'd check reclines; silent she looks On the dark river. “Do those shadows move?” She rises, listens. “What strange sounds are these?” The hum continues, deepens—hark, a step! Men—soldiers—what are they? The foe! the foe!” The gloom Deepen'd, the silence deepen'd. She trembles, and her eyes are closed with fear. What shall she do? Obey affection's voice, And duty's mandate? And, with terror's haste, She hurried to the camp of sleeping France. Meantime, o'erwearied Montcalm, on his couch Extended, sought not sleep, nor had he doff'd His garments. But the toil of thought intense, At length o'erpower'd, confused him. Slumbering, He toss'd from side to side, and sent abroad The wildly-wandering soul—a reinless steed; Nor slept, nor waked! Upstarted stiff his locks, By terror smitten; his bones shook. Motionless, In gloom and might, before his troubled soul, A power embodied stood, unspeakable And hueless. “Sleep'st thou, Montcalm?” said a voice, “Still, vanquish'd victor, sleep! Why wake to shame? Sleep! Wolfe hath torn the laurel from thy brow.” Thus spake the evil dream. Still slumber'd he, Unhappy; and a mute, expressive tear Stole from his eyelids o'er his swarthy cheek, When, pale, approach'd unseen, with noiseless step, Miranion. Fear and love had bleach'd her cheek; And with mute, trembling, inexpressible Emotion she beheld the man beloved! She heard him sigh—nearer she drew—she stoop'd, “He weeps,” she cried; “Ah, wherefore in his sleep?” She look'd—she paused; at length, with timid hand, She touched the hero's forehead, and she said, “Rise, Montcalm!” Up, at once, the warrior sprang, Confused, astonish'd, and, ere well awake, His hand had half-undrawn the ready sword; Then on the maid he gazed, with such a look Of doubt and fierce surprise, as drove the blood Back from her fading lip oppressively. “Who—whence?” he cried, retiring; and he raised, With outstretch'd arm, the falchion now unsheath'd. His voice so stern (love was not in the tone) Came on her heart like death; and, faltering, At length she cried, “A friend to France I come! Wolfe climbs the heights of Abraham, and seeks The city.” Fix'd in awe, she stood unmoved; The growing light was fearful in her eye: He gazed upon her, never had he seen Her face before, never a face so fair— So mild, so sad, so innocent! She seem'd The gentle angel of the dead, ordain'd To bear the virgin-spirit to its home Eternal; and if beauty could have moved His stern, ambitious heart, sure he had loved That heavenly pensiveness. He stood—he look'd— He answer'd not; he turn'd in thought away. Slow grew the light, the darkness dimly waned, And on the mountains walk'd the dawn thro' flowers, When Montcalm's eye shrank, dark from what it fear'd— The banner'd cross, high on the vanquish'd heights, O'er bright steel waving red, and England's host, Embattled, like a crimson fortress vast, Cresting the eminence with hostile arms. Why bends Miranion o'er a soldier's couch? To kiss the pillow of her warrior love. Her heart is fill'd with joy, which, soon to fade, Painteth her pale cheek with a cherub's glow; And for a moment she forgets herself. Rise, tall Miranion of the pensive smile! Rise, stately vestal, from thy warrior's couch! Soon shalt thou tremble o'er thy counted beads, And, faltering, listen in thine earnest prayer, Telling to heaven, to heaven alone, thy love; And vainly calling every saint to save. He is not fallen yet! But e'er that sun Shall set and rise, one kiss, thy first and last, On Montcalm's lip thy breaking heart shall print; Nor shall the unfeeling taunt of prudery Flush poor Miranion's faded cheek with shame. “My hero!” shalt thou say, “for ever mine! My soul in this chill kiss hath wedded thee.” Then shalt thou grasp his hand fast, with a look That almost might awake the illustrious dead. But ere grief close thine eyes for ever, one Proud spectacle, one long procession more, Shalt thou behold—sad, slow, funereal pomp, And nations weeping o'er thy Montcalm's bier. The victor vanquish'd! That competitor Worthy of Britain's Wolfe—less fortunate, Not less heroic—doom'd alike to fall. Immortal both! Equal their love of fame; Their genius equal, and their scorn of death. Then, when the mid-day torches shall no more Cast the dim gloom of mockery on the slain; Although no marble tells where thou are laid, Miranion, night shall love the lonely spot, The stars shall look in silence on its flowers, The moon-beams there shall slumber, and the dews Weep o'er a hapless virgin's modest grave. INSCRIPTIONS. I. Amid the moss'd old forest's loneliness, To warn the future poet, and to wake The tender thought, these lines a studious youth Carved on this tree. Haply some man of mind, Hereafter, may the rhymeless verses read, And drop amid the druid solitude The tear that angels envy. Chatterton Lived but to die—perchance without a prayer! A sable angel, tearing her own heart With dreadful transport, lured him to her arms! These wilds will see no more his hopeless smile; No more the moon-beam in his dewy eye Will glisten; and no more the cloudless night Hear, from her starry throne, his lonely steps! O God! forgive him, though he ask'd thee not! II. Stop, man, and read! A nameless person—one Whom the gay sons of proud frivolity Knew not, and therefore scorn'd not—slumbers here; His life was one long day of misery; Yet sank he not beneath the load of life. His tested soul, with holy quietness, Smiled at the malice of adversity, And rose on wings of humble faith to God. Reader, do thou resemble this poor man In all things but his fortunes. Go and speed! III. Now nought is mine! Yet, what I had, I have! The wings that bore my soul from earth to heaven! And still, untired, through fields of amplitude, The pinions of my fervour shall advance With growing swiftness; for beneath his throne— Whom seeking, my soul soars unsatisfied— Time lowly bends, and Power, the giant, kneels, While Harmony proclaims her Father's name. MY FIRST SONNET. Hail to the Christian! Bold is he, to stand On danger's rock, undaunted, to pursue The paths of right. What power shall him subdue? Not thine, all-shunn'd Misfortune! though thy hand Waves the keen edge of hunger as a brand; Nor thine, Prosperity, whose magic dew Melts the iced rock to water! He shall view Th' elect of God, with them walk hand in hand. His emblem is the mountain, capp'd with snow, And gnarl'd with forests; by tempestuous fire Above scourged vainly; and assail'd below By ocean's vainly storm-conflicting ire; Th' Eternal Mountain! that, while tides shall flow, Will commune with the stars, and bid his pines aspire. THE EXILE. To Edward Lytton Bulwer, Esq., who helped me when I was helpless and unknown, I beg leave to dedicate this Poem. I. World-lighting flambeau of that awful One Whose greatness thought hath not conceived! thou bright And ruby-hair'd similitude of might Omniscient yet invisible and lone; The stillness of all power upon his throne— The life of life—whose fountain none can tell! Thou flar'st o'er ocean's nation-girding streams Fearless of change, as though, indeed, thy beams Were of the eternal, uncreated light. High, not secure! bright, not unchangeable! What dost thou see above, around, below? Unweeping pride and pleasure only? No! Vicissitude and ruin are to thee Familiar. Prosperer! thou look'st on me And feel'st no pity. But thyself shalt fade, Extinguish'd, as a taper. He who made Can unmake all things. He who reigns alone, The sole unrivall'd—He whose burning throne Is wheel'd on suns—shall quench thee with a frown, And cast thy dust beneath his axle down; Crush'd, thou shalt roll no more. No wrinkle yet Of age insults thy beauty. Thou art bright As man's vain youth, with harlot joys beset, Who says, while love, in ecstasy divine, Seals his warm cheek with lips that glow like thine, “My fortune shall be splendid as thy light.” Thou laughing parent of the woful years! Hence, with thy beams that mock the sorrowing heart! In all thy pageantry of flame, depart! And let me commune with sad night in tears. II. But day yet lingers in the gorgeous west, O'er capes that smile like islands of the bless'd; His red orb biggens as his beams retire, And wide Potomac undulates in fire; While giant clouds, that o'er his hills aspire, Curtain the setting sun, whose broad brow glows As if he wish'd, gazing in transport deep, To look sweet evening into blushing sleep; And, ere he slumber'd, kiss her in repose— Then sink to golden rest. Above thy tide, Wild river! on the headlands at thy side, With straining eye, the Exile, Alfred, stands, And thinks, with fever'd soul, of distant lands; Thinks of loved England, whence, by terror led, Escaped from Worcester's fatal fight, he fled, And sought in desert woods, o'er ocean cross'd, To cherish life, when all its joys were lost. Dear to that Exile now are memory's tales, For now they speak of Avon's dewy dales— Sweet scenes, whose pleasures he no more may share, And her, his love, who mourns deserted there. III. He saw eve's beamy purple fade away; He watch'd the changeful clouds till all was grey; He started—“'Twas the waving grass!” he said, “I am not watch'd: or, fluttering overhead, Did the owl start the oriole from rest? The humming-bird reposes on the flower; Fragrance drinks freshness in her richest bower; High roosts the turkey; on Potomac's breast The mallard sleeps; and here the rattlesnake, Couch'd on his coils—the desert's deadly pest! The bull-frog booms not yet; all accentless, The listening wave doth not a pebble shake; Nor doth a sound disturb the loneliness Of Nature in her slumbers; nor a breeze Skim o'er the boundless forest, to awake The tempest-braving pine of centuries; And, while the stars that guard the tranquil skies Look down in silence on the silent trees, High on the mountain's crest the lonely cloud Reposes, like a giant in his shroud: How silently! Haply, at this sweet hour, In England, to the purple-blossom'd heath The sun-tann'd peat-man plods; while every bower Weeps in the eye of morn, the drover wakes With dewy locks; and, while his plaid he shakes, O'er crumpled grass unbathed by midnight shower, Calls his tried dog that lurks the thorn beneath— Roused by whose voice, the bird that loves the sky Sheds bright pearls from his clover canopy, And, soaring, sings! And, o'er her fragrant pail, More sweetly sings the milk-maid in the vale; And the mist lessens on the distant sea; And o'er the rooky grove the smoke curls slow; And fair the halcyon is on writhen tree, Whose giant arms stretch where the rock is riven; But fairer far, on quivering waves below, Are rock, tree, halcyon, and serenest heaven. Oh, bless'd is he, who, arm'd with dusky gun, Sees on Britannian wastes the moor fowl run, Or, flying, fall! Oh, bless'd who hears the bells Sound o'er the dewy smile of Albion's dells, While age, and youth, and blissful love repair To sabbath service, country wake, or fair! But is my injured Emma happy there?” IV. He spake in tears of sweetly mingled pain: What though the heart that nurses love is fain To build in darkness his unsocial seat? What though he loves the desert-spirit's sigh? The tear that visits seldom his sad eye, Though life hath sweeter tears, may yet be sweet. Pensive and pale, return'd he to his farm, Where wealth was his, but not contentment's charm; And as, with pausing footsteps, he came near, Sad tones, that spake of wither'd joys once dear— Tones that his heart acknowledged—met his ear, And retrospection drank of aconite. A moment blank he stood, then onward flew; But, as with lightning blasted, back he drew; And, trembling, gazed—on what appalling sight? No dusky daughter of the burning day, Shrank from the slave-herd's whip, uplifted high; On no dark maid of fervid Africa Gloated that scourger's Algerenian eye; But, born where men are free and maids are fair, From happy Albion wafted o'er the wave, And late arrived, a convict and a slave, Was she for whose wild shriek he hunger'd there; And on her cheek of woe the rose had been. To Alfred's tongue words came not; but there came Strength to his arm, and to his spirit flame. He rush'd the mourner and the pang between; And, stunn'd beneath his blow, the slave-herd sank, And rose, and fell, and rose again, and drank Not with his eyes his victim's starting blood, But, coughing, drank his own, and ghastly stood, Then, faint, the convict totter'd to her shed; Her sable sisters, weeping, stay'd her tread, And laid on leaves of maize her languid head, Where soon, by sad dreams visited, she slept, And wildly, in her broken slumbers, wept. V. But Alfred slept not. On his spirit broke A troubled light; and in his heart awoke The power that smiles to see the gloom increase, And, sleeping on the thunder, dreams of peace, And holiest stillness—the storm's angel, Hope. Oh, 'reft of her, could man, the insect, cope With darkness, dread, and danger? He arose, Leaving the mattrass of his pale unrest, And walk'd into the cool and midnight air, That whisper'd to the wildness of his breast, Like spirit from the islands of repose, And almost lull'd to sleep the demon, Care. VI. Darkness was spread o'er half the sky. The moon Slept on her sea of blue. The stars appear'd To dream around her, in night's awful noon! Wild lightnings, fluttering distant, fringed with fire The growing darkness of the wrathful west; And, on sublime Potomac's troubled breast, Convolved in seeming agony and ire, The red reflection, like a dragon, burn'd. And though the coming thunder was not heard, Yet, on the breezeless sky perturb'd, in dread The silent bear his gleaming eye-balls turn'd; Hoarse croak'd the eagle on the mountain's head; The buffalo, in ominous horror low'd; The storm-fiend whisper'd from his desert cave; The forest shudder'd; the tumultuous cloud Wander'd in heav'n; black roll'd the moaning wave. VII. Lone stood the cabin of the pallid slave; And, through the door unclosed, a pine-torch cast Its wrinkling beam. With trembling knees, he pass'd Before the wan light thrice, then stood to gaze. She slumber'd still, and still she wept in sleep, While o'er her sad face gleam'd the feeble blaze. He enter'd, and he could not choose but weep; For, as he bent above her faded frame, In murmuring accents faint, she sigh'd his name. “Emma!” he said; but falteringly he spoke, And kiss'd her brow; again—and she awoke, And shriek'd, and rose half up, convulsed with fear; Then, trembling, turn'd, and hid her face in shame. But he, with soothing words, and many a tear, Spake to her woe, bidding her yet be glad, And question'd of her destiny severe, And how, and why, she met a doom so sad? She did not lift her eye—she fear'd to look On him who talk'd of comfort—but it came; For, like a sweet remember'd vision, stole His tones of pity on her drooping soul; Or, like the liquid music of the brook To thirst's charm'd ear, when the unseen waters creep Beneath the blossoming umbrage of the vale, Among flowers dear to woe, that love to weep, And thus she told her melancholy tale, While, o'er the hut, loud moan'd the increasing gale, And nearer thunder chased the lightning pale. VIII. “Oh, thou art good! I did not hope to hear The voice of kindness in this land of fear. My love went to the war, and came not back; Prince Charles, they said, was worsted in the strife: Anxious, I watch'd on expectation's rack; But Alfred fled beyond the sea for life. Soon I became—a mother!—not a wife! My wrathful parents spurn'd me from their door. Oh, cherish'd like the choicest garden flower, And nurtured on the breast of tenderness, And all unusèd to the evil hour, How should their silk-clad daughter face distress? Where should the out-cast Emma lay her head? I sought and found a little lowly shed, Where long we lived, resign'd and calm, though poor: My active needle earned our daily bread. But, sickness, then, by famine follow'd came: My hungry boy look'd up for food, and pined! My wearying task was profitless; my frame Enfeebled by disease, unnerved my mind. I would not beg the alms of charity, Nor ask the legal dole of paupery; No, I did worse, far worse—Heaven pardon me! Thou wouldst not think that Emma once was fair; Yet fair she was, or Envy's self hath lied; And she had still some sweet and drooping charms; But she had still some virtue, and some pride. I turn'd abhorrent from lust's venomous arms; How could I clasp pollution to my heart? I wept, and pray'd, but want would not depart; And my boy's asking look, so pale and sad, Drove me, in one unhappy moment, mad. No pitying daughter of the rich and free, With angel looks and bounty, came to me. Oh, how I envied then the spotless maid, Who pass'd me, blushing, and almost afraid! Spurn'd by the base, scarce pitied by the good, Affliction rush'd upon me, like a flood. No aid without, and want and woe within; Deserted—ah, no! left—by him I loved; My life's life was that boy, the child of sin! What mother's heart could see his tears unmoved? I pawn'd the stolen silk!—detected—tried In the throng'd court I stood, half petrified, And there was doom'd beyond the billowy tide, On wild Columbia's shore of tears to groan. IX. “As on the strand I stood—and not alone, But chain'd to others, like in crime and fate, And female, too, though lost to female fears— A man approach'd, more old in grief than years, And kiss'd the fetter'd hand he bathed with tears, And, faltering, strove, but strove in vain, to speak. Oh, he was changed! but Emma knew him well; And with him came forgiveness, though too late. But when he ask'd forgiveness of his child, His guilty child, I thought my heart would break! And when I bade him to my mother bear A lock of hapless Emma's golden hair—, A kiss from one so lost—and pray'd him tell If she, too, had the sinful one forgiv'n— O God! in more than agony, he smiled, Then raved, amid his tears, in laughter wild! ‘Emma,’ he said, ‘thy mother is in Heav'n, Brought to the grave with sorrow—not by thee— It was God's will! and none from sin are free.’ Again he kiss'd me, and he turn'd to go; But no—poor Emma would not have it so; He saw the boy on whom my sad eye fell, And kiss'd my little Alfred—then—farewell! I saw him not, but sobb'd, in sorrow blind, And heard his faint ‘God bless thee!’ in the wind. X. “Ah, surely in that hour I should have died, But that my boy clung fondly to my side, And, not in vain, to soothe his mother tried! Then came a thought which nature could not bear: ‘What! take him from me?’ shriek'd my heart's despair. But little Alfred left the land with me; And, while the tall ship rush'd into the sea, He sate, and smiled upon his mother's knee, Pleased with the sails, the motion, and the deep. The billows seem'd to rock my cares to sleep. Oh, there was comfort in the dreadful thought That far from happiest England I should go, Where none who knew me could behold my woe, To taunt the shame that want and sin had brought; And that the poor companions of my way Were wretches too, but I less vile than they! I loved to sit upon the airy deck, While swell'd the moonlight heav'ns, without a speck, O'er ocean without wrinkle; and I loved, While star-light only glimmer'd through the clouds, And, arrow-like, and billow-borne, we moved, To hear the fresh gale whistle in the shrouds, And see the manèd waves each other chase, Like flaming coursers in the endless race. Then, with delighted terror, from the prow, High on the mountain billow's summit curl'd, Down look'd I on the wat'ry vales below, That, like a tenantless and hopeless world, Barren and black, and deepening chilly, frown'd. And, on that far land, whither I was bound, Enthusiast Hope beheld, nor whip, nor chains; But hill and shadowy vale seem'd fairy ground, And groves elysian deck'd the teeming plains; And airy fingers form'd, with many a flower Of dulcet breath, a visionary bower; And there my fancy wander'd with my child, And saw him strive, with lifted hand, to reach The grape's dark luxury, or the glowing peach; And Peace walk'd with us through the balmy wild, Look'd on my tears, nor only look'd, but smiled. XI. “O Heaven! thou shouldst, according to the load, Apportion strength to bear it on the road! My boy refused his food, forgot to play, And sicken'd on the waters, day by day. He smiled more seldom on his mother's smile; He prattled less, in accents void of guile, Of that wild land, beyond the golden wave, Where I, not he, was doom'd to be a slave! Cold o'er his limbs a listless languor grew; Paleness came o'er his eye of placid blue; Pale mourn'd the lily, where the rose had died, And timid, trembling, clung he to my side. He was my all on earth. Oh, who can speak The anxious mother's too prophetic woe, Who sees death feeding on her dear child's cheek, And strives in vain to think it is not so? Ah! many a sad and sleepless night I pass'd, O'er his couch listening, in the pausing blast, While on his brow, more sad from hour to hour, Droop'd wan dejection, like a fading flower! At length, my boy seem'd better, and I slept— Oh, soundly! but, methought, my mother wept O'er her poor Emma, and, in accents low, Said, ‘Ah! why do I weep? and weep in vain For one so loved, so lost? Emma, thy pain Draws to a close! e'en now is rent in twain The loveliest link that binds thy breast to woe. Soon, broken heart, we soon shall meet again!’ Then o'er my face her freezing hand she cross'd, And, bending, kiss'd me, with her lip of frost. I waked; and, at my side—Oh! still and cold!— Oh! what a tale that dreadful chillness told! Shrieking, I started up, in terror wild; Alas! and had I lived to dread my child? Eager, I snatch'd him from his swinging bed; His limbs were stiff—he moved not—he was dead! XII. “O let me weep!—what mother would not weep To see her child committed to the deep?— All lifeless, o'er his marble forehead roll'd, The third night saw his locks repose in gold. Methinks 'twas moonlight, and a torch cast wide Its lanthorn'd radiance o'er the umber'd tide, As wan on deck he lay, serenely fair, And, oh! so like his sire! that man of care, (From home, and hope, and all he loved, impell'd,) Who ne'er his child, in life, or death, beheld, And could not come, my breaking heart to share! No mournful flowers, by weeping fondness laid, Nor pink, nor rose, droop'd on his breast display'd, Nor half-blown daisy, in his little hand. Wide was the field around, but 'twas not land. His features wore a sweet and pensive grace, And death was beauty on his silent face. No more his sad eye look'd me into tears! Closed was that eye beneath his pale cold brow; And on his calm lips, which had lost their glow, But which, though pale, seem'd half unclosed to speak, Loiter'd a smile, like moonlight on the snow. I gazed upon him still—not wild with fears— Gone were my fears, and present was despair! But, as I gazed, a little lock of hair, Stirr'd by the breeze, play'd, trembling, on his cheek; O God! my heart!—I thought life still was there! But, to commit him to his watery grave, O'er which the winds, unwearied mourners, rave— One, who strove darkly sorrow's sob to sway, Upraised the body; thrice I bade him stay; For still my wordless heart had much to say, And still I bent, and gazed, and, gazing, wept. At last, my sisters, with humane constraint, Held me, and I was calm as dying saint; While the stern weeper lower'd into the sea My ill-starr'd boy! deep—buried deep he slept. And then I look'd to heav'n in agony, And pray'd to end my pilgrimage of pain, That I might meet my beauteous boy again! Oh, had he lived to reach this wretched land, And then expired—I would have bless'd the strand. But, where my poor boy lies I may not lie; I cannot come, with broken heart, to sigh O'er his loved dust, and strew with flowers his turf: His pillow hath no cover but the surf! I may not pour the soul drop from mine eye Near his cold bed; he slumbers in the wave! Oh, I will love the sea, because it is his grave!” XIII. Weeping, she saw not him whose swimming eye O'erflowed with bitterness and agony; But, when he smote his breast with frenzied force, And, stamping, cursed himself in dread remorse; Then started she—as one who sleeps with pain O'erwearied starts awake, but sleeps again; And soon, more calm, with alter'd voice, she said— “Perhaps my boy had lived, had Alfred stay'd! Ah! wherefore fled he, hopeless and afraid? And, ah! why fled not Emma at his side? I on the scaffold would with him have died. Without a look, a kiss, a tear, he went; Unheard by Emma, every prayer he sent To heav'n, (while grim Mischance stood by, and smiled,) To bless the mother of his unborn child! Nor after weeks, and months, and mournful years, Did his dear letter, long, and stain'd with tears, Bring to her bosom, o'er the waters wide, Comfort and hope, which nought could bring beside! Alas! he fled not, but at Worcester died!” XIV. “O blame him not!” exclaim'd the self-blamed youth, “If he has err'd, forgive his fault, forgive! And canst thou doubt thy Alfred's love and truth? And deem him false, who lives to bid thee live? We both live, Emma, happier days to see; Behold, 'tis Alfred's self, preserved for thee! Come to my heart! thou still art all to me.” XV. Ah, clasp'd he death? or did she lifeless seem? Slackening his grasp, he stoop'd but heard no sigh! Then paleness blush'd; and life's returning beam Relumed the faded azure of her eye. Faintly she strove to clasp him to her side. “Was it, indeed, my angel's voice?” she cried; “And wilt thou take the convict to thy breast? And shall the vile, the outcast, the oppress'd, The poor and trodden worm, again be bless'd? Ah, no, no—heav'n ordaineth otherwise! My love!—we meet too late!—thy Emma dies.” XVI. Then, with clasp'd hands, and fervent hearts dismay'd, That she might live for him, both mutely pray'd. But, o'er their silence burst the heavy blast; And, wrapp'd in darkness, the sky-torrent pass'd; And down the giants of the forest dash'd; And, pale as day, the night with lightning flash'd; And, through awed heav'n, a peal, that might have been The funeral dirge of suns and systems, crash'd: More dread, more near, the bright blue blaze was seen, Peal following peal, with direr pause between. On the wild light she turn'd her wilder eye, And grasp'd his hands, in dying agony, Fast, and still faster, as the flash rush'd by. “Spare me!” she cried. “Oh, thou destroying rod! Hark! 'tis the voice of unforgiving God!— A mother murder'd, and a sire in woe! Alfred, the deed was mine! for thee, for thee, I broke her heart, and turn'd his locks to snow! Hark! 'tis the roaring of the mighty sea! Lo, how the mountain-billows fall and rise! And while their rage, beneath the howling night, Lifts my boy's tresses to the wild moonlight, Yet doth the wretch, th' unwedded mother, live, Who, for those poor unvalued locks would give All, save her hope to kiss them in the skies! But see! he rises from his wat'ry bed, And at his guilty mother shakes his head! There, dost thou see him, blue and shivering stand, And lift at thee his little threatening hand? Oh, dreadful!—Hold me!—Catch me!—Die with me!— Alas! that must not, and it should not be! No—pray that both our sins may be forgiv'n; Then come! and heav'n will-will indeed be heav'n!” XVII. He felt her slackening grasp his hand forego, And grasp'd more firmly hers, in speechless woe. Quiver'd her cheek, with death's convulsions streak'd: Still gazed he—all was fix'd! he started up, and shriek'd. XVIII. No sound is heard, save of the brook increased; The weary cloud is still. The blast hath ceased To rend the wildly fluctuating sky, And tear the tall pine from his place on high. Meek quiet on the freshen'd verdure sleeps; Less frequent, from the beauteous cedar weeps The heavy rain-drop on the flower beneath; And, fainter round the hills, the dying gale Murmurs the requiem of departed night; While, like bless'd isles, the woods emerge in light, In placid light, fair as the brow of death O'er which that mourner bends, so lost and pale. “Emma, how sweet the calm that follows storms! How sweet to sleep in tears, and wake in heav'n!” Morn soon will smile on Nature's drooping charms, And smooth the tresses which the night hath riven; But no sun shall arise that wretch to cheer; Alas! his grief despairs, and hath no tear! From heav'n's deep blue, the stars steal, one by one; Pale fades the moon—still paler—she is gone. As yet, no marshall'd clouds in splendour roll'd, See, on Potomac's breast their mirror'd gold; Yet, eastward, lo! th' horizon, forest-fringed, Blushes—and dusky heights are ruby-tinged! Lo! like a warrior in impatient ire, On mailèd steed, fire-scarf'd, and helm'd with fire, Forth rides the sun, in burning beauty strong, Hurling his bright shafts, as he darts along! Oh, not more splendidly emerged the morn When light, and life, and blissful love were born, And day and beauty, ere his woes began, Smiled first elysium on the soul of man, And—while no cloud in stillest heav'n was seen— O'er ocean's waveless magnitude serene, Rose, all on flame his vital race to run, In dreadless youth, how proudly rose that sun! And, see! o'er Emma's still and snowy cheek There comes a glow, ethereal, heav'nly, meek, As if a lily blush'd to meet the light! But what, wan Exile! may be said to thee? Look'st thou on death? then death is fair to see. The sunbeams mingle with her lifeless hair; From her closed eye a tear is stealing slow; Life seems to linger on the silence there, Like fragrance in a gather'd rose of snow; But, oh! that kiss of ice!—despair!—despair!— Ah! woods and waves, and heav'n and earth are bright; But on the hopeless Exile's heart—'tis night! BOTHWELL: A DRAMATIC POEM. To my great Master, Robert Southey, who Condescended to teach me the Art of Poetry, I most respectfully dedicate this Drama. SCENE—Inside of a dungeon, in a fortress on the coast of Norway. Bothwell sleeping. Rhinvalt gazing through a barred window on the rocks, and stormy sea below. Rhin. Splendour in heaven, and horror on the main! Sunshine and storm at once—a troubled day. Clouds roll in brightness, and descend in rain. How the waves rush into the rocky bay, Shaking th' eternal barriers of the land! And ocean's face is like a battle plain, Where giant demons combat hand to hand; While, as their voices sink and swell again, Peace, listening on the rainbow, bends in pain. Where is the voice, whose stillness man's heart hears, Like dream'd-of music, wordless, soft, and low? The voice, which dries on Sorrow's cheek her tears, Or, lest she perish, bids the current flow? That voice the whirlwind in his rage reveres; It bids the blast a tranquil sabbath keep: Lonely as death, harmonious as the spheres, It whispers to the wildness of the deep, 'Till, calm as cradled babe, the billows sleep. Oh, careless of the tempest in his ire, Blush, ruby glow of western heav'n! Oh, cast The hue of roses, steep'd in liquid fire, On ocean in his conflict with the blast, And quiver into darkness, and retire, And let wild day to calmest night subside; Let the tired sailor from his toil respire, The drench'd flag hang, unmoving, o'er the tide, And, pillow'd on still clouds, the whirlwind ride! Then, Queen of Silence, robe thee, and arise, And, through the barr'd loop of this dungeon old, Visit, once more, its inmate's blasted eyes! Let him again, though late, thy light behold! Soulless, not sightless, have his eye-balls roll'd, Alike, in light and darkness, desolate. The storm beat on his heart—he felt no cold; Summer look'd on him, from heaven's fiery gate— Shivering, he scowl'd, and knew not that he scowl'd. Unweeping, yet perturb'd; his bed a stone; Bonds on his body—on his mind a spell; Ten years in solitude, (yet not alone,) And conscious only to the inward hell; Here hath it been his hideous lot to dwell. But heav'n can bid the spirit's gloom depart, Can chase from his torn soul the demon fell, And, whispering, find a listener in his heart. O let him weep again! then, tearless dwell, In his dark, narrow home, unrung by passing bell! [A long pause. Loud thunder; and, after an interval, thunder heard remote.] The storm hath ceased. The sun is set: the trees Are fain to slumber; and, on ocean's breast, How softly, yet how solemnly, the breeze, With unperceived gradation, sinks to rest! No voice, no sound is on the ear impress'd; Twilight is weeping o'er the pensive rose; The stoat slumbers, coil'd up in his nest; The grosbeak on the owl's perch seeks repose; And o'er the heights, behold! a pale light glows. Waked by the bat, up springs the startled snake; The cloud's edge brightens—lo, the moon! and grove, And tree, and shrub, bathed in her beams, awake, With tresses cluster'd like the locks of love. Behold! the ocean's tremor! slowly move The cloud-like sails; and, as their way they urge, Fancy might almost deem she saw, above, The streamer's chasten'd hues; bright sleeps the surge, And dark the rocks, on ocean's glittering verge. Now lovers meet, and labour's task is done. Now stillness hears the breathing heifer. Now Heav'n's azure deepens; and, where rock-rills run, Rest on the shadowy mountain's airy brow Clouds that have ta'en their farewell of the sun; While calmness, reigning o'er that wintry clime, Pauses and listens;—hark! the evening gun! Oh, hark!—the sound expires! and silence is sublime. Moonlight o'er ocean's stillness! on the crest Of the poor maniac, moonlight!—He is calm; Calmer he soon will be in endless rest:— O, be thy coolness to his brow as balm, And breathe, thou fresh breeze, on his burning breast! For memory is returning to his brain; The dreadful past, with worse than woe impress'd; And torturing time's eternity of pain; The curse of mind returns! O take it back again! [A long pause, during which he bends anxiously over Bothwell.] Alas! how flutteringly he draws his breath! Both. My blessed Mary! Rhin. Calmer he appears— Sad, fatal symptom! swift approaches death. Both. Mary! a hand of fire my bosom sears.— Oh do not leave me!—Heavenly Mary!—years, Ages of torture pass'd, and thou cam'st not; I waited still, and watch'd, but not in tears; I could not weep; mine eyes are dry and hot, And long, long since, to shed a tear forgot. A word! though it condemn me!—stay! she's gone! Gone! and to come no more! [He faints.] Rhin. Ah, is it so? His pilgrimage is o'er, his task is done; How grimly still he lies! yet his eyes glow, As with strange meaning. Troubled spirit, go! How threateningly his teeth are clench'd! how fast He clutches his grasp'd hair!—hush!—breathless? No! Life still is here, though withering hope be past; Come, bridegroom of despair! and be this sigh his last. Both. Where am I? What art thou? Rhin. Call me a friend, And this a prison. Both. Voice of torture, cease!— Oh, it returns!—terrific vision, end!— When was it? Yesterday? no matter—peace! I do remember, and too well, too well! Rhin. How is it with thee? Both. Why wilt thou offend?— Ha! all ye fiends of earth, and ye of hell, I surely am awake! Thine angel send, Thou, King of Terrors call'd, and break this hideous spell! Rhin. A tear? and shed by thee? Both. I breathed in flame; The sleepless worm of wrath was busy here; When—ah, it was a dream!—my lady came, Lovely and wan in woe, with the big tear To cool my fever'd soul. In love and fear, O'er me she bent, as at the Hermitage, When (maim'd in conflict with the mountaineer) She kiss'd my wounds, while Darnley swell'd with rage; Tears only! not a word! she fled!—and I am here. She fled; and then, within a sable room, Methought I saw the headsman and the axe; And men stood round the block, with brows of gloom, Gazing, yet mute, as images of wax; And, while the victim moved to meet her doom, All wept for Mary Stuart. Pale, she bent, As when we parted last; yet towards the tomb Calmly she look'd, and, smiling, prayers up sent To pitying heav'n. A deep and fearful boom Of mutter'd accents rose, when to the ground The sever'd head fell bleeding! and, aghast, Horror on horror stared. And then a sound Swell'd, hoarsely yelling, on the sudden blast, As of a female voice that mimick'd woe; But, as above that hall of death it pass'd, 'Twas changed into a laugh, wild, sullen, low, Like a fiend's growl, who, from heav'n's splendour cast, Quaffs fire and wrath, where pain's red embers glow. Do I not know thee? I'm forgetful grown: Where did I see thee first? Rhin. Here, even here; Thy ten years' comrade—still to thee unknown. In all that time thou didst not shed a tear Until this hour. Raving, with groan on groan, Thou spak'st of more than horror, and thy moan Was torture's music. O'er thy forehead hot Thine hands were clasp'd; and still wast thou alone, Brooding o'er things that have been, and are not, Though I was with thee, almost turn'd to stone, Here, where I pined for twenty years before Thy coming. Both. Thirty years a prisoner! Here, didst thou say? Rhin. Ay, thirty years and more. My wife!—O never may I look on her! My children! Both. Didst thou spill man's blood; or why? Rhin. I spilt man's blood in battle. Oh, no more, Liberty, shall I breath thy air on high Where the cloud travels, or along the shore Where the waves frown, like patriots sworn to die! I met th' oppressors of my native land, (Wide waved their plumes o'er Norway's wilds afar,) I met them, breast to breast, and hand to hand, O'ercome, not vanquish'd, in the unequal war: And this is Freedom's grave. Both. Freedom? Thou fool, Deserving chains! Freedom?—a word to scare The sceptred babe. Of thy own dream thou tool And champion, white in folly! From me far Be rant like thine—of sound a senseless jar. Rhin. Say, who art thou that rav'st of murder'd kings, And dar'st, before her champion vow'd, profane The name of Freedom? Long forgotten things To my soul beckon; and my hand would fain (Stung by thy venom) grasp a sword again, In battle with these tyrants! Gone?—alas! 'Tis the death-rattle in the throat—his pain Draws to a close. Again? Dark spirit, pass! Both. Lift, lift me up! that on my burning brain The pallid light may shine! and let me see Once more the ocean. Thanks! Hail, placid deep! Oh, the cold light is comfort! and to me The freshness of the breeze comes like sweet sleep To him whose tears his painful pillow steep! When last I saw those billows they were red. Mate of my dungeon! know'st thou why I weep? My chariot, and my war-horse, and my bed, Ocean, before me swells, in all its glory spread. Lovely! still lovely Nature! and a line Of quivering beams, athwart the wavy space, Runs like a beauteous road to realms divine, Ending where sea and stooping heav'n embrace. Crisp'd with glad smiles in ocean's aged face; Gemm'd are the fingers of his wrinkled hand. Like glittering fishes, in the wanton race, The little waves leap laughing to the land, Light following light—an everlasting chase. Lovely, still lovely! chaste moon, is thy beam Now laid on Jedburgh's mossy walls asleep, Where Mary pined for me; or dost thou gleam O'er Stirling, where I first, in transport deep, Kiss'd her bless'd hand, when Darnley bade her weep; Or o'er Linlithgow and the billows blue, Where (captured on the forest-waving steep) She almost fear'd my love, so dear and true; Or on that sad field, where she could but look adieu? Rhin. Weep on! if thou, indeed, art he whose fame Hath pierced th' oblivion even of this tomb, Where life is buried, and whose fearful name Amazement loves to speak, while o'er thy doom, Trembling, he weeps. Did she, whose charms make tame All other beauty, Scotland's matchless Queen, Creation's wonder, on that wither'd frame, Enamour'd smile? Sweet tears there are, I ween; Speak then of her, where tears are shed more oft than seen. Both. Perhaps the artist might, with cunning hand, Mimic the morn on Mary's lip of love; And fancy might before the canvas stand, And deem he saw th' unreal bosom move. But who could paint her heav'nly soul, which glows With more than kindness—the soft thoughts that rove Over the moonlight of her heart's repose— The wish to hood the falcon, spare the dove, Destroy the thorn, and multiply the rose? Oh, hadst thou words of fire, thou couldst not paint My Mary in her majesty of mind, Expressing half the queen and half the saint! Her fancy, wild as pinions of the wind, Or sky-ascending eagle, that looks down, Calm, on the homeless cloud he leaves behind; Yet beautiful as freshest flower full blown, That bends beneath the midnight dews reclined; Or yon resplendent path, o'er ocean's slumber thrown. 'Twas such a night—O ne'er, bless'd thought, depart!— When Mary utter'd first, in words of flame, The love, the guilt, the madness of her heart, While on my bosom burn'd her cheek of shame. Thy blood is ice, and, therefore, thou wilt blame The queen, the woman, the adulterous wife, The hapless, and the fair!—Oh, but her name Needs not thy mangling! Her disastrous life Needs not thy curse! Spare, slanderer, spare her fame! Then wore the heav'ns, as now, the clouded veil; Yet mark'd I well her tears, and that wan smile So tender, so confiding, whose sweet tale, By memory told, can even now beguile My spirit of its gloom! for then the pale Sultana of the night her form display'd, Pavilion'd in the pearly clouds afar, Like brightness sleeping, or a naked maid, In virgin charms unrivall'd; while each star, Astonish'd at her beauty, seem'd to fade— Each planet, envy-stung, to turn aside— Veiling their blushes with their golden hair. Oh! moment rich in transport, love, and pride! Big, too, with woe, with terror, with despair! The quivering flesh, though torture-torn, may live; But souls, once deeply wounded, heal no more: And deem'st thou that scorn'd woman can forgive? Darnley, thou dream'st, but not as heretofore! Yet Mary wept for Darnley, while she kiss'd His murderer's cheek at midnight. Sad was she; And he, who then had seen her, would have miss'd The rose that was not where it wont to be, Or marvell'd at its paleness. None might see The heart, but on the features there was woe. Then put she on a mask, and gloomily— For dance and ball prepared—arose to go: “Spare, spare my Darnley's life!” she said—but mean'd she so? Now bends the murderer—Mark his forehead fell! What says the dark deliberation there?— Now bends the murderer—Hark!—it is a knell!— Hark!—sound or motion? 'Twas his cringing hair. Now bends the murderer—wherefore doth he start? 'Tis silence—silence that is terrible! When he hath business, silence should depart, And maniac darkness, borrowing sounds from hell, Suffer him not to hear his throbbing heart?— Now bends the murderer o'er the dozing King, Who, like an o'er-gorged serpent, motionless, Lies drunk with wine, a seeming-senseless thing; Yet his eyes roll with dreadful consciousness, Thickens his throat in impotent distress, And his voice strives for utterance, while that wretch Doth on his royal victim's bosom press His knee, preparing round his neck to stretch The horrible cord. Lo! dark as th' alpine vetch, Stares his wide-open, blood-shot, bursting eye, And on the murderer flashes vengeful fire; While the black visage, in dire agony, Swells, like a bloated toad that dies in ire, And quivers into fixedness!—On high Raising the corpse, forth into th' moonlight air The staggering murderer bears it silently, Lays it on earth, sees the fix'd eye-ball glare, And turns, affrighted, from the lifeless stare. Ho! fire the mine! and let the house be rent To atoms!—that dark guile may say to fear, “Ah, dire mischance! mysterious accident! Ah, would it were explain'd! ah, would it were!” Up, up, the rushing, red volcano went, And wide o'er earth, and heav'n, and ocean flash'd A torrent of earth-lightning sky-ward sent; O'er heav'n, earth, sea, the dread explosion crash'd; Then, clattering far, the downward fragments dash'd. Roar'd the rude sailor o'er th' illumined sea, “Hell is in Scotland!” Shudder'd Roslin's hall, Low'd the scar'd heifer on the distant lea, Trembled the city, shriek'd the festival, Paused the pale dance from his delighted task, Quaked every masker of the splendid ball; Raised hands, unanswer'd questions seem'd to ask; And there was one who lean'd against the wall, Close pressing to her face, with hands convulsed, her mask. And night was after that, but blessed night Was never more! for thrilling voices cried To th' dreaming sleep, on th' watcher's pale affright, “Who murder'd Darnley? Who the match applied? Did Hepburn murder Darnley?”—“Fool!” replied Accents responsive, fang'd with scorpion sting, In whispers faint, while all was mute beside, “'Twas the Queen's husband that did kill the King!” And o'er the murderer's soul swept horror's freezing wing. Rhin. Terrific, but untrue!—Have such things been? Thy looks say ay! and dire are they to me. Unhappy King! and more unhappy Queen! But who the murderer? Both. What is that to thee? Think'st thou I kill'd him? Come but near my chain, Thou base suspector of scathed misery! And I will dash the links into thy brain, And lay thee (champion of the can't-be-free!) There, for thine insolence—never to rise again. [He faints.] Rhin. Alas! how far'st thou now? Darkness hath chased The dreadful paleness from thy face; thine eye, Upturn'd, displays its white; thy cheek is laced With quivering tortuous folds; thy lip, awry, Snarls, as thou tear'st the straw; the speechless storm Frowns on thy brow, where drops of agony Stand thick and beadlike; and, while all thy form Is crumpled with convulsion, threat'ningly Thou breathest, smiting th' air, and writhing like a worm. Both. Treason in arms!—Sirs, ye are envious all. To Mary's marriage did ye not consent? Do you deny your signatures—this scrawl Of your vile names? True, I do not repent That I divorced my wife to wed the Queen; True, I hate Mar; true, I scorn Huntley's bawl; True, I am higher now than I have been— And will remain so, though your heads should fall. Craig, of the nasal twang, who pray'st so well! Glencairn, of th' icy eye, and tawny hide! If I am prouder than the Prince of Hell, Are ye all meanness that ye have no pride? My merit is my crime. I love my sword, And that high sin for which the angels fell; But still agrees my action with my word; That yours does not so, let rebellion tell. Submit! or perish here! or elsewhere—by the cord. My comrades, whose brave deeds my heart attests, Be jocund!—But, ah, see their trembling knees! Their eyes are vanquish'd—not by th' tossing crests, But by yon rag, the pestilence of the breeze, Painted with villanous horror! In their breasts Ardour and manliness make now with fear A shameful treaty, casting all behests That honour loves, into th' inglorious rear. By heav'n, their cowardice hath sold us here! Ha! dastards, terror-quell'd as by a charm, What! steal ye from the field?—My sword for thee, Mary! and courage for his cause! this arm Shall now decide the contest!—Can it be? Did Lindsay claim the fight?—and still lives he? He lives, and I to say it. Hell's black night Lower'd o'er my soul, and Darnley scowl'd on me, And Mary would not let her coward fight, But bade him barter all for infamy! Dishonour'd, yet unburied! Morton's face Wrinkled with insult; while, with cover'd brow, Bravest Kirkaldy mourn'd a foe's disgrace; And Murray's mean content was mutter'd low. Pale, speechless Mary wept, almost ashamed Of him she mourn'd. Flash'd o'er my cheek the glow Of rage against myself; and undefamed, Worse than my reputation, and not slow, I left my soul behind, and fled in wordless woe. Then ocean was my home, and I became Outcast of human kind, making my prey The pallid merchant; and my wither'd name Was leagued with spoil, and havock, and dismay; Fear'd, as the lightning fiend, on steed of flame— The Arab of the sky. And from that day Mary I saw no more. Sleepless desire Wept; but she came not, even in dreams, to say, (Until this hour,) “All hopeless wretch, expire!” Rhin. A troubled dream thy changeful life hath been Of storm and splendour. Girt with awe and power, A Thane illustrious; married to a queen; Obey'd, loved, flatter'd; blasted in an hour; A homicide; a homeless fugitive O'er earth, to thee a waste without a flower; A pirate on the ocean, doom'd to live Like the dark osprey! Could Fate sink thee lower? Defeated, captured, dungeon'd, in this tower A raving maniac! Both. Ah, what next? the gloom Of rayless fire eternal, o'er the foam Of torment-uttering curses, and the boom That moans through horror's everlasting home! Woe, without hope—immortal wakefulness— The brow of tossing agony—the gloam Of flitting fiends, who, with taunts pitiless, Talk of lost honour, rancorous, as they roam Through night, whose vales no dawn shall ever bless!— Accursèd who outlives his fame!—Thou scene Of my last conflict, where the captive's chain Made me acquainted with despair! serene Ocean, thou mock'st my bitterness of pain, For thou, too, saw'st me vanquish'd, yet not slain! O, that my heart's-blood had but stain'd the wave, That I had plunged never to rise again, And sought in thy profoundest depths a grave! White billow! know'st thou Scotland? did thy wet Foot ever spurn the shell on her loved strand? There hast thou stoop'd, the sea-weed grey to fret— Or glaze the pebble with thy crystal hand? I am of Scotland. Dear to me the sand That sparkles where my infant days were nursed! Dear is the vilest weed of that wild land Where I have been so happy, so accursed! Oh, tell me, hast thou seen my lady stand Upon the moonlight shore, with troubled eye, Looking t'wards Norway? did'st thou gaze on her? And did she speak of one far thence, and sigh? O, that I were with thee a passenger To Scotland, the bless'd Thule, with a sky Changeful, like woman! would, oh, would I were! But vainly hence my frantic wishes fly. Who reigns at Holyrood? Is Mary there? And does she sometimes shed, for him once loved, a tear? Farewell, my heart's divinity! To kiss Thy sad lip into smiles of tenderness; To worship at that stainless shrine of bliss; To meet th' elysium of thy warm caress; To be the prisoner of thy tears; to bless Thy dark eye's weeping passion; and to hear The word, or sigh, soul-toned, or accentless, Murmur for one so vile, and yet so dear— Alas! 'tis mine no more!—Thou hast undone me, Fear! Champion of Freedom, pray thee, pardon me My laughter, if I now can laugh!—(in hell They laugh not)—he who doth now address thee Is Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell. Hark! my knell! The death-owl shrieks it. Ere I cease to fetch These pantings for the shroud, tell me, O tell! Believ'st thou God?—Blow on a dying wretch, Blow, wind that com'st from Scotland!—Fare-thee-well! The owl shrieks—I shall have no other passingbell. Rhin. As from the chill, bright ice the sunbeam flies, So (but reluctant) life's last light retires From the cold mirror of his closing eyes: He bids the surge adieu!—falls back—expires! No passing bell? Yea, I that bell will be; Pale night shall hear the requiem of my sighs; My woe-worn heart hath still some tears for thee; Nor will thy shade the tribute sad despise. Brother, farewell!—Ah, yes!—no voice replies: But my tears flow—albeit in vain they flow— For him who at my feet so darkly sleeps; And Freedom's champion, with the locks of snow, Now fears the form o'er which he sternly weeps. An awful gloom upon my spirit creeps. My ten years' comrade! whither art thou fled? Thou art not here! Thy lifeless picture keeps Its place before me, while, almost in dread, I shrink, yet gaze, and long to share thy bed. [He retires to a corner of the dungeon farthest from the corpse, and there continues to gaze upon it in silence.] LOVE. To G. Calvert Holland, M.D., who, by his efforts in favour of Universal Education, is preparing better days for the England of my children, and a brighter futurity for the human race, I inscribe this Poem. BOOK I. What marvel, Laura, if thy minstrel shun The peopled waste, the loneliness of crowds? I love the streams, that mirror as they run The voiceless clouds. The stillness of Almighty Power is here, And Solitude—the present Deity— Throned on the hills that meet the bending sphere, How silently! O look around thee! On those rocks sublime, Th' impression of eternal feet is seen! These mountains are the eldest-born of Time, Still young and green! What nobler home, what holier company For Love and Thought, than forests and the heath, Where life's Great Cause, in his sublimity, Dwells lone as Death? What scene more fit than this, though wild and drear, With Heav'n, the universal sea, above, To prompt the song most sweet to lady's ear— The lay of Love? Hear'st thou the murmur of the living rill, That ever seeks the valley, green and still, Gliding from view, love-listening groves between, And most melodious when it flows unseen? What though, at times, the sun in wrath retire, And o'er its course the clouds dissolve in fire? Soon bend the skies in brighter beauty fair, And see, where'er it flows, their image there. Softly it steals beneath the lucid sky; So, Love's lone stream steals to eternity. How the flowers freshen where the waters glide, And seem to listen to the limpid tide! So bless'd is he whose life serenely flows, Reflecting golden clouds, and many a rose. He hears Heav'n's voice in every warbling grove, And sees in every flower the smile of Love. Love! eldest Muse! Time heard thine earliest lay When light through Heaven led forth the new-born day. The stars, that give no accent to the wind, Are golden odes and music to the mind; So, passion's thrill is Nature's minstrelsy; So, to the young heart, Love is poetry. God of the soul! illumination, caught From thy bright glance, is energy to thought; And song, bereft of thee, is cold and tame, The bard a cinder, uninstinct with flame. But when the heart looks through the eyes of Love On Nature's form, things lifeless breathe and move;— The dewy forest smiles, dim morning shakes The rainbow from his plumage, music wakes The dimpled ripple of the azure wave, In fiery floods green hills their tresses lave, And myriad flowers all bright'ning from the dews, Day's earth-born stars, their golden beams effuse: Transported passion bids rocks, floods, and skies Burst into song, while her delighted eyes To all they see their own rich hues impart; And the heart's language speaks to every heart. Love, 'twas my heart that named thee! sweetest word Here, or in highest Heav'n, pronounced or heard! Whether by seraph near the throne above, Or soul-sick maiden in the vernal grove, Or matron, with her first-born on her knee, Or, sweeter, lisp'd by rose-lipp'd infancy! Yes, Love, my heart did name thee! not because Thy mandate gave the bright-hair'd comet laws; Nor that thy hand, in good almightiest, showers The overblooming, fiery-petall'd flowers Wide o'er the fields of hyacinthine Heav'n; But that to me thy richest smile hath giv'n Bliss, tried in pain. So, 'mid my rosy boys, In joy and grief, I sing thy griefs and joys. Bless'd is the hearth, when daughters gird the fire, And sons, that shall be happier than their sire Who sees them crowd around his evening chair, While Love and Hope inspire his wordless pray'r. O from their home paternal may they go, With little to unlearn, though much to know! Them may no poison'd tongue, no evil eye Curse for the virtues that refuse to die; The generous heart, the independent mind, Till truth, like falsehood, leaves a sting behind! May temperance crown their feast, and friendship share! May pity come, Love's sister spirit, there! May they shun baseness, as they shun the grave! May they be frugal, pious, humble, brave! Sweet peace be theirs, the moonlight of the breast, And occupation, and alternate rest; And, dear to care and thought, the rural walk! Theirs be no flower that withers on the stalk, But roses cropp'd, that shall not bloom in vain, And Hope's bless'd sun, that sets to rise again! Be chaste their nuptial bed, their home be sweet, Their floor resound the tread of little feet; Bless'd beyond fear and fate, if bless'd by thee, And heirs, O Love, of thine eternity! Young Devotee, whose fond and guileless heart Feels, for the first time, Love's delicious smart! Now—while the sun his crimson radiance showers, And stars the green night of the woods with flowers, That hung, like rubies, on each trembling thorn, Outshine the myriad opals of the morn— Now take thy lonely walk of ecstasy; The sun is in the west, young Devotee! Or, wilt thou seek thine idol proud and fair, To throw thee at her feet and worship there The might serene of beauty on her throne, And feel her power almighty o'er thy own? Then—as a cloud, athwart the desert cast, Relieves the wretch who tracks the sand aghast— If but a ringlet tremble on her cheek, Or, if her lips but move and seem to speak, Or, evening brighten in her eye divine, How sweet a pain, young Devotee, is thine! But deeper transport far, and sweeter pain, For Love's victorious votaries remain. O may'st thou ne'er, like hapless Tasso, know Ambitious Love's excess of maddening woe! But long, and long thy bride and truth's to be, May beauty smile or weep in bliss with thee; Nor live, like sad Miranda, to deplore, Where savage grandeur crowns some alien shore, Connubial widowhood in hated arms, And curse, with every kiss, her fatal charms! Oh, bless'd, who drinks the bliss that Hymen yields, And plucks life's roses in his quiet fields! Though in his absence hours seem lengthen'd years, His presence hallows separation's tears. Oh! clasp'd in dreams, for his delay'd return Fond arms are stretch'd, and speechless wishes burn! Love o'er his fever'd soul sheds tears more sweet Than angel's smiles, when parted angels meet: To him no fabled paradise is given; His very sorrows charm, and breathe of heav'n. And soon the fairest form that walks below Shall bless the name of parent in her woe; Soon o'er her babe shall breathe a mother's pray'r, And kiss its father's living picture there, While the young stranger on life's dangerous way Turns with a smile his blue eye to the day. But where shall poesy fit colours choose To paint the matron morning sprinkling dews O'er half-blown flowers, that pay their early breath In tribute to the Lord of life and death, Who bids the lucid blush of nature glow Till angels see another Heaven below, Dimples the deep with every breeze that blows, And gives its sweet existence to the rose? Maternal Love, best type of heavenly bliss! Thou show'st the joys of brighter worlds in this, When sons and daughters rush to thy embrace, And Love is painted on each rosy face! E'en in the vale of poverty and gloom, Thy joys, like heath-flowers on the moorland, bloom, And o'er thy child of ignorance thy sigh Is wordless pray'r, and not unheard on high. But crown'd with knowledge, best Instructress thou! Tuition smiles seraphic on thy brow. What though Contempt, with simpering sneer aside, Deems all thy teaching labour misapplied? What though around thee move the slaves of gain Who oft inflict, but seldom pity pain; Still pointing, as they shake the sapient head, At talent's rags, and learning's sons half-fed? Thy children's worth, maturing day by day, Thy children's glory, shall thy cares repay; And they shall bless thine age with accents kind, E'en as his daughter nursed Ferdoosi blind, When three times thirty years and ten had shed Illustrious Winter on his honour'd head. A soldier, Charles shall Wolfe's renown transcend, Proud to avenge his country, or defend. John, grave in childhood, on the soul shall shower The Gospel-dews, with renovating power; Sublime instruction from his lips shall flow, And Mercy's antidote for sin and woe. Matilda's name shall shine, admired afar, In Fame's blue night, a new, and lovely star: May she not hope for glory's bright caress, Fair, young, ingenious, and a Britoness? May she not hope, where all can judge and feel? Where wealth crowns virtue, genius, and O'Neil? Where Opie's pages truth and joy impart? Where Owenson and Edgeworth paint the heart? Where, crown'd with terror, Radcliffe rears her throne, A dread Medea, but a guiltless one; And tragic Baillie stole from Nature's side The mantle left by Shakspeare, when he died? But better bliss shall glowing Mary prove, Bless'd in a faithful husband's fondest love. Then each sweet grandchild on thy heart shall rise A new existence, rich in ecstasies; And, mother's mother! a new name, be given To thee, a Heav'n to come, and memory's Heav'n. Peace, like an infant, slumbering at thy feet, Thy day shall melt into the evening sweet; And while elysian breezes fan thy breast, Thou shalt sink gently, with a smile, to rest; And many a relative, and many a friend, And many a tear, shall note thy gentle end. When Cook, a sailor's boy, with aching eye, Gazed from the deep on oft-climb'd Roseberry, While, trembling as she listen'd to the blast, His anxious parent sea-ward wishes cast, And fervent pray'r was mute, but not suppress'd, Though love was resignation in her breast; Why did'st thou not—thou happiest name of joy! Bid her cheer'd spirit see that deathless boy Bear round the globe Britannia's flag unfurl'd, And from th' abyss unknown call forth a world? Where death-freed wanderers tread celestial shores, And silence, in eternal light, adores! Spirit of Jones! to earth-born Angels tell What sweet instructress taught her child so well, What earthly form is likest theirs above, And, in thy teacher, bless Maternal Love! When Watts' pale mother, o'er her thoughtful child, In hope and fear alternate wept and smiled, And bore privation that his mind might feed, Dare greatest things, and, greatly wise, succeed;— Though rapture mingled with her bosom's smart, And sweetest visions tranquillized her heart, She could not see him give Improvement birth, And with his vapoury lever lift the earth. E'en the bright promise in the parent's soul Mistook and bless'd a portion for the whole; And Love, for once, a timid prophet, told Scarce half the worth that truth-taught Time unroll'd. In Severn's vale, a wan and moonstruck boy Sought, by the daisy's side, a pensive joy; Held converse with the sea-birds as they pass'd, And strange and dire communion with the blast, And read in sunbeams, and the starry sky, The golden language of eternity. Age saw him, and look'd sad; the young men smiled; And wondering maidens shunn'd his aspect wild. But He—the ever kind, the ever wise! Who sees through fate, with omnipresent eyes, Hid from the mother, while she bless'd her son, The woes of genius, and of Chatterton. What child is hopeless in his mother's sight? Say, then, O thou, whose very tears delight, Walks there a wretch, displeased, amid thy flowers, Who, while thy smile illumes life's saddest hours, With serpent hiss malign thy worth denies, And views thy transports with disdainful eyes? There are, sweet power! who blame thy gentle rule, And call thy hearth of happiness the school Where manly hearts, by hate coerced in vain, First learn to like, and then to wear a chain. Cold, but not wise, a partial task is theirs, To blame the rich soil for the weed it bears. What power invincible, on earth, in heav'n Like Love can strive with fate, like Love hath striven? Thou only spark in man that is divine! If thine is transport, Stoic strength is thine; And calmly can'st thou smile on danger's form, Like rosy summer on the thunder-storm. Thine is the hand to act, the heart to dare, The soul to feel, the fortitude to bear, The breast that softly glows, or bravely bleeds, The voice that calls to fame, the step that leads; And time-tried truth and constancy, that prove He is no wretch who hath no friend but Love. Too oft hath man, his dream of splendour o'er, Seen his friend's dog assail him at the door, But often, too, when hope within him dies, Love clasps him close, though hope despairs and flies! So, when o'er Eden waved the fiery brand, Our exiled parents wander'd, hand in hand, And left, with many a sigh, th' elysian scene, A joyless, widow'd bed where bliss had been, A solitude of beauty, vainly fair, “A flower unseen, that scents the desert air:” Love, and sweet tears, for Eden lost suffice; Though Eden was no longer Paradise; Oft looking back, they went, but side by side— The world before them, weeping Love their guide. Yes, Fortune's faithless wrongs may turn to steel The flattering foe, that well can feign to feel; The desperate heart may lean on torture's thorn, The sun be darkness to the eye forlorn; All may be hopeless gloom, around, above, All, save thy quenchless smile, heroic Love! Of this bear witness, Denbigh, and thou den, Too oft the torturing home of hapless men, Where Waller's Angel cheer'd him in the tomb, And smiled a twilight o'er his dungeon's gloom! Bear witness, too, ye groves of Tankersley, And thou, pure rill, whose sky-born melody Warbles of heav'nly peace! for ye beheld (When Fanshawe sought, by Cromwell's sword compell'd, His care-worn form beneath your shades to hide) The mate of Honour by her husband's side! She, when the iron pierced his soul, was near, To bathe his aching fetters with a tear: And, when her supplication broke his chain, She kiss'd away the mem'ry of his pain, And bade him strike, where Druid oaks aspire, The love-taught Lusian's care-assuaging lyre. O, sink not then, desponding slave of care! Arise, be dreadless! why should man despair? Lo, woman's love can plant the rock with flowers, Gild Fate's black storm, when big with death it lowers, Make cowards brave, arm Pity's hand to slay, And scathe Invasion's hordes in disarray! Love! when red Battle, o'er the stormy crest Of free Helvetia, roll'd his eye unbless'd, Thou heard'st thy sons on God and Freedom call, Thou saw'st thy sons in Freedom's conflict fall. The infant Tell, when that sad tale is told, Lowers, with indignant front, his locks of gold, Clangs his small drum, with despot-daring hand, And half assumes his little wooden brand; Rage, wonder, grief, his guileless heart surprise, And all the mother swells into his eyes. Then, when th' horizon flamed—a flag of doom— When pale affright heard breeze-born horrors boom, When blazing hamlets spoke of havock near, And beauty paid her hero with a tear, What wonder, if the virgin helm'd her head, Rush'd to the field with thundering volleys red, And, by her lover's side, a martial form, Tower'd the Bellona of the battle-storm? So, when around thy home war's banners fly, And patriots on the threshold fight and die, The Matron, then—her dreadless husband slain, And dead the famish'd child, that lived in vain— Climbs with Thalestrian port the leaguered wall, Where death rides sulphury on the whirling ball, Fires her loud tube, and on the fiends below Shakes from her widow'd tresses shame and woe. To scathe with dread th' Oppressor's cheek of flame, To foil Death's gambler at his favourite game, To soothe despair, and bid e'en anguish please, These are thy triumphs, mighty Conqueror, these! Vaulting Ambition hesitates to meet Thy powerful glance; War crouches at thy feet. When troubles rise, when peril's direst form, Frowning on man, adds darkness to the storm; Then—while, in spite of shame, the bravest fear— Affection stands her babes and husband near, Endures and dares, for him, and them alone, And, in their danger, quite forgets her own. When Virtue dies, in pallid Want's embrace Not friendless, though abandon'd by the base; Then o'er the grave from which all flatterers fly, Love sheds a tear which kingdoms could not buy. And—as the April sunbeam melts the snow, Till peeps the golden flower that slept below— Thy look can charm the Fiend beneath whose eye All joys, but thine, and bless'd Religion's, die, The king of woes, pride-humbling Poverty. BOOK II. O faithful Love, by Poverty embraced! Thy heart is fire, amid a wintry waste; Thy joys are roses, born on Hecla's brow; Thy home is Eden, warm amid the snow; And she, thy mate, when coldest blows the storm, Clings then most fondly to thy guardian form; E'en as thy taper gives intensest light, When o'er thy bow'd roof darkest falls the night. Oh, if thou e'er hast wrong'd her, if thou e'er From those mild eyes hast caused one bitter tear To flow unseen, repent, and sin no more! For richest gems, compared with her, are poor; Gold, weigh'd against her heart, is light—is vile; And when thou sufferest, who shall see her smile? Sighing, ye wake, and sighing sink to sleep, And seldom smile, without fresh cause to weep; (Scarce dry the pebble, by the wave dash'd o'er, Another comes, to wet it as before;) Yet, while in gloom your freezing day declines, How fair the wintry sunbeam when it shines! Your foliage, where no summer leaf is seen, Sweetly embroiders earth's white veil with green; And your broad branches, proud of storm-tried strength, Stretch to the winds in sport their stalwart length, And calmly wave, beneath the darkest hour, The ice-born fruit, the frost-defying flower. Let Luxury, sickening in profusion's chair, Unwisely pamper his unworthy heir, And, while he feeds him, blush and tremble too! But, Love and Labour, blush not, fear not you! Your children, (splinters from the mountain's side,) With rugged hands, shall for themselves provide. Parent of valour, cast away thy fear! Mother of men, be proud without a tear! While round your hearth the woe-nursed virtues move, And all that manliness can ask of Love; Remember Hogarth, and abjure despair, Remember Arkwright, and the peasant Clare. Burns, o'er the plough, sung sweet his wood-notes wild, And richest Shakspeare was a poor man's child. Sire, green in age, mild, patient, toil-inured, Endure thine evils, as thou hast endured. Behold thy wedded daughter, and rejoice! Hear hope's sweet accents in a grandchild's voice! See Freedom's bulwarks in thy sons arise, And Hampden, Russell, Sidney, in their eyes! And should some new Napoleon's curse subdue All hearths but thine, let him behold them too, And timely shun a deadlier Waterloo! Northumbrian vales! ye saw, in silent pride, The pensive brow of lowly Akenside, When, poor, yet learn'd, he wander'd young and free, And felt within the strong divinity. Scenes of his youth, where first he woo'd the Nine, His spirit still is with you, vales of Tyne! As when he breathed, your blue-bell'd paths along, The soul of Plato into British song. Born in a lowly hut an infant slept, Dreamful in sleep, and, sleeping, smiled or wept: Silent the youth—the man was grave and shy: His parents loved to watch his wondering eye: And, lo! he waved a prophet's hand, and gave, Where the winds soar, a pathway to the wave! From hill to hill bade air-hung rivers stride, And flow through mountains with a conqueror's pride: O'er grazing herds, lo! ships suspended sail, And Brindley's praise hath wings in every gale! The worm came up to drink the welcome shower; The redbreast quaff'd the rain-drop in the bower; The flaskering duck through freshen'd lilies swam; The bright roach took the fly below the dam; Ramp'd the glad colt, and cropp'd the pensile spray; No more in dust uprose the sultry way; The lark was in the cloud; the woodbine hung More sweetly o'er the chaffinch while he sung; And the wild rose, from every dripping bush, Beheld on silvery Sheaf the mirror'd blush; When calmly seated on his pannier'd ass, Where travellers hear the steel hiss as they pass, A milkboy, sheltering from the transient storm, Chalk'd, on the grinder's wall, an infant's form; Young Chantrey smiled; no critic praised or blamed; And golden promise smiled, and thus exclaim'd— “Go, child of genius! rich be thine increase; Go—be the Phidias of the second Greece!” Greece! thou art fallen, by luxury o'erthrown, Not vanquish'd by the Man of Macedon! For ever fall'n! and Sculpture fell with thee. But from the ranks of British poverty A glory hath burst forth, and matchless powers Shall make th' eternal grace of Sculpture ours. The eternal grace? Alas! the date assign'd To works, call'd deathless, of creative mind, Is but a speck upon the sea of days; And frail man's immortality of praise, A moment to th' eternity of Time, That is, and was, and shall be the sublime, The unbeginning, the unending sea, Dimensionless as God's infinity! England, like Greece, shall fall, despoil'd, defaced. And weep, the Tadmor of the watery waste. The wave shall mock her lone and manless shore; The deep shall know her freighted wealth no more; And unborn wanderers, in the future wood Where London stands, shall ask where London stood? As melt the clouds at summer's feet sublime, The burning forests of noon's fiery clime; So, art and power, with freedom, melt away In long prosperity's unclouded ray. Let soul-sick minstrels sing of myrtle bowers, And diadem the brow of Love with flowers, Matured where earth brings forth the rack and scourge, And ruthless tortures languid labours urge. Slaves! where ye toil for tyrants, Love is not: Love's noblest temple is the freeman's cot! What though each blast its humble thatch uptear? Bold shall the tyrant be that enters there. Look up and see, where, throned on alpine snow, Valour disdains the bondsman's vales below: So, Love, companion of the wolf, may roam, And in the desert find a boundless home; But will not bow the knee to pomp and pride, Where slaves of slaves with hate and fear reside. What are the glories that Oppression throws Around his vainly-guarded throne of woes; The marbles of divinity, and all That decks pale Freedom's pomp of funeral? Let Grandeur's home, o'er subject fields and floods, Rise, like a mountain clad in wintry woods, And columns tall, of marble wrought, uphold The spiry roof, and ceilings coved in gold; But better than the palace and the slave Is Nature's cavern that o'erlooks the wave, Rock-paved beneath, and granite-arch'd above, If Independence sojourn there with Love! Star of the heart! O still on Britain smile, Of old thy chosen, once thy favour'd isle, And by the nations, envious and unbless'd, Call'd thine and Freedom's Eden in the west! Then hymns to Love arose from every glen, Each British cottage was thy temple then. But now what Demon blasts thy happiest land, And bids thine exiled offspring crowd the strand; Or pens in festering towns the victim swain, And sweeps thy cot, thy garden, from the plain? Lo! where the pauper idles in despair, Thy Eden droops, for blight and dearth are there! And, like an autumn floweret, lingering late, Scarce lives a relic of thy happier state— A wreck of peace and love, with sadness seen, That faintly tells what England once hath been! Amid coeval orchards, grey with age, Screen'd by memorial elms from winter's rage. Scarce stands a shed, where virtue loves to be, A hut of self-dependent poverty, Where want pines proudly, though distress and fear Stain thy mute votary with too sad a tear; And yet I feel thine altar still is here— Here, where thy Goldsmith's too prophetic strain, 'Mid the few ruins that attest thy reign, Deplored the sinking hind, the desecrated plain. Alas, sweet Auburn! since thy bard bewail'd “Thy bowers, by Trade's unfeeling sons assail'd,” How many a village, sweet like thee, hath seen The once-bless'd cottage joyless on the green! Now e'en “the last of all thy harmless train, The sad historian of the pensive plain,” Now “e'en that feeble, solitary thing” Hath ceased “to bend above the plashy spring;” And her fall'n children breathe their curses deep, Far from that home of which they think and weep. Where myriad chimneys wrap their dens in shade, They rob the night to ply their sickly trade, And weekly come, with subjugated soul, Degraded, lost, to ask the workhouse dole. Slow seems the gloomy Angel, slow, to bring His opiate cold to hopeless suffering; And, when in death's long sleep their eyes shall close, Not with their fathers shall their dust repose, By hoary playmates of their boyhood laid Where never corse-thief plied his horrid trade: Not in the village church-yard, lone and green, Around their graves, shall weeping friends be seen; But surly haste shall delve their shallow bed, And hireling hands shall lay them with the dead, Where chapmen bargain on the letter'd stone, Or stumble, careless, o'er the frequent bone. How long, O Love! shall loveless Avarice sow Despair and sloth, and ask why curses grow? Or dost thou give thy choicest gifts in vain, And mock with seeming good the heir of pain? God! where thy image dwells must sorrow dwell? Must Famine make thy earth her hopeless hell? Did thy uplifted axe, Napoleon, find, In manless deserts, barren as the wind, Food? or, when black depopulation shed Hunger o'er Moscow, were Gaul's armies fed? Why do the clouds cast fatness on the hills? Why pours the mountain his unfailing rills? Why teems with flowers the vale—with life the sky? Why weds with loveliness utility? Why woos the foodful plain, in blessing bless'd, The sons of labour to her virgin breast? Why is the transcript of thy Heav'n so fair, If man, poor victim! lives but to despair? O thou, whose brightening wing is plumed with light, At once that pinion's beauty and its might— Thou true Prometheus, by whose lore were taught To fix on adamant the fleeting thought, Star-ruling science, calculation strong, The march of letters, and th' array of song! Twin-born with Liberty, and child of Love, Woe-conquering Knowledge! when wilt thou remove Th' opprobium of the earth—the chain'd in soul? When wilt thou make man's deadliest sickness whole? Lo! while our “bearers of glad tidings” roam To farthest lands, we pine in gloom at home! And still, in thought, I hear one whirlwind past! Still hurtles in my soul the dying blast, The echo of a hell of sound, that jarr'd The ear of Heav'n, as when his angels warr'd! Terrific drama! and the actors men; But such may shuddering earth ne'er see again! Unlike her children, less than fiends or more! And one, of scarcely human grandeur, bore World-shaking thunder on his sightless wing; But, when thy spear assail'd his brandish'd sting, He waned to half a Cæsar. Him the frown Of ruin dash'd beneath thy axle down; Then horror shook him from his deathlike sleep; Then vengeance cast him o'er the troubled deep; And, on the winds of retribution hurl'd, His demon-shadow still appals the world! When, Knowledge, when will mortals learn thy lore? They plant thy tree, and water it with gore. When wilt thou—when thy power almighty prove, And bind the sons of men in chains of Love? Rise, hope of nations, and assuage their ills! This wills thy Teacher—this thy Parent wills. For this, Love taught thy childhood in her bower, And bade thee syllable her words of power, Till brighten'd on thy brow sublimest thought; And she, thy teacher, wonder'd as she taught. O rise and reign, bless'd Power, that lov'st to bless; Queen of all worlds, best name of mightiness! Thy book of life to Labour's children give: Let Destitution learn to read, and live; And Independence, smiling on thy brow, Sing hymns to Love and Plenty, o'er the plough! Thy kingdom come! on earth let discord cease; Come thy long Sabbath of bless'd love and peace! No more let Famine, from her idle hell, Unwonted guest, with Love and Labour dwell, Till death stares ghastly-wild in living eyes, And at Pride's bloated feet his feeder dies, While Luxury, hand in hand with Ruin, moves To do the Devil's work, and call it Love's. What whirlwind, in his dread magnificence, What Samiel blasts, like hopeless indolence? And man, when active most, and govern'd best, Hath ills enough, insatiate to molest His fragile peace—some strong in evil will, But weak in act; and others arm'd to kill, Or swift to wound;—Revenge, with venomous eyes; Distrust, beneath whose frown affection dies; Scorn, reptile Scorn, that hate's the eagle's wing; Mean Envy's grubs, that stink, and long to sting; Mischance, Disease, Detraction's coward dart, And the long silence of the broken heart; Nor only these. Tradition is the sigh Of one who hath no hope; and history Bears—like a river deep, tumultuous, wide— Gloom, guilt, and woe, on his eternal tide. Nor need we read of regal wrath and hate, Troy lost by Love and army-scatt'ring Fate. The humblest hamlet's annals wake a sigh; And could yon cot, hoar with antiquity, Relate what deeds within it have been done, What hopeless suffering there hath cursed the sun, The tale might draw down Pride's parch'd cheek severe, From Power's hard eye, e'en Pluto's iron tear. THE LETTER. A tale of tears I dedicate To him—the wise, the good, the great— Who wrote, while raged the factious storm, Our Bill of long-delay'd Reform. Oh, if my song, when I am dust, May hope to please the meek and just, Whoe'er thou art that lov'st true fame, From this page tear not Lambton's name. Where is the youth, for deeds immortal born, Who loved to whisper to th' embattled corn, And cluster'd woodbines, breathing o'er the stream, Endymion's beauteous passion for a dream? Why did he drop the harp from fingers cold, And sleep so soon with demigods of old? Oh, who so well could sing Love's joys and pains? He lived in melody, as if his veins Pour'd music: from his lips came words of fire, The voice of Greece, the tones of Homer's lyre. But me no guide, through academic shade, Led to the cell where glory's spoils are laid; And shall my hand, for joyous task unmeet, Presume, O Love! to scatter at thy feet, Instead of roses, nightshade; and instead Of fragrance, chaplets gather'd from the dead? Self-taught and ill, my notes uncouth I try, And chant my rugged English ruggedly, To gloomy themes. Yet, sick with hope deferr'd, I hear a voice, though mournful, proudly heard; And I have planted on my destined tomb A pensive tree, that bends in storm and gloom, Unseen, unknown. Oh, when shall it repair, In lonely moonlight, beautiful and sweet, The weeping bough? and flourish green and fair, Where slighted maidens mourn, and ghosts of lovers meet? Wild as the chainless air, or bird that wings The blue above the clouds, and soaring sings Blythe welcome to the dewy, fragrant morn, Young Anna dwelt with health, the mountain-born, Where, murmuring with the moorland bee, the Dearn Leaps from his well, through heath and plumy fern, Till, pleased with richer blossoms in the vale, He checks his wave, and hears the milkmaid's tale. There, light of heart, nor lonely, nor unseen, She walk'd and sung, and talk'd and laugh'd between, Paying, in raptures from her guileless breast, The soul-felt tribute which pleased Heav'n likes best; Or paused, on broomy banks to sit or kneel, While hedge-side bluebells died beneath her heel. Her brow, where gentlest beauty held high state, Was vein-inlaid with azure, delicate As tenderest leaf of shaded columbine That bends beneath the love-sick eglantine; And, oh, she was the meekest maid of all That ever stoop'd o'er alpine waterfall, Or look'd up to the hills from valleys sweet, Like Nature's primrose, dropp'd at Bretland's feet. She loved, with virgin-love, a stately swain: Unhappy passion! though Charles loved again. Fresh was his cheek, as evening's flowers, that furl'd Their banners in the sun; his locks outcurl'd The finger'd hyacinth, outshone the down On youngest morning's cheek, when, newly blown, The maiden violet meekly views the south, While the rich wallflower, in its early growth, Prepares deep amber, for th' expecting eye That sees in fading flowers eternity. She wedded, high in hope and passion strong; Unhappy marriage! for Charles loved not long; And, at the altar, dark she stood in light; Heav'n's swift fire there bereft her eyes of sight. E'en as she turn'd preparing to withdraw, Burst flash and crash, in overwhelming awe; And pale she stood, with sightless eyes upraised; And pale the bridegroom wax'd, as mute he gazed; And from the holy temple, sadly led, A mourning bride she moved, with languish'd head, To weep, benighted. The moon's gentle ray Shone not to her, and, unperceived, the day Died into darkness. But, with Love's soft speech, And tones that knew the answering heart to reach, Charles fondly strove her sorrow to beguile, And drooping blindness slowly learn'd to smile. Time eased her bosom of its hopeless sighs, Till joy, at length, revisited her eyes; But they, doom'd ever “objectless to roll,” Could bring no more the blue hills to the soul, Or, with night's shadows, bid all gloom depart, And paint life's morning faces on the heart. Sad, then, it was, to see a form so fair, In tears resign'd, though dark, not in despair. Still on his bosom she could lean and weep, And feign a dream of eyelids closed in sleep; Still, when with him she walked, at eve or morn, She could inhale the odours of the thorn; And while she hung so helpless on his arm, Dependence gave his words a double charm: They fell like dew o'er violets on her ear, Or like offended Love's forgiving tear On man's warm breast. Yet, by the plaining rill, The thought would rise, that flowers on every hill Were beautiful to every eye but hers; That broom and hawthorn, and the armèd furze, Bloom'd, vainly fair, beneath the sapphire sky. Still waved the birch in memory's happy eye; Yet, made by vain regret more sadly sweet, The hours return'd, when oft, with naked feet And bare plunged arm, the trout or loach she took, Where stones upturn'd perturb'd the shallow brook; Or, 'mid her sister Naiades of the dale, Held forth the lizard by his golden tail In childish wonder; and an envious pang Assail'd her weakness, if the echoes rang With “Holiday!” proclaim'd in joyous cries; And little boys and girls, with upturn'd eyes, Came whispering round her. But that selfish pain Humbled its victim: soon she sought again For joy in sorrow. True, she could not see The wingless squirrel frisk from tree to tree, The wren from twig to twig; but she could hear The Tartar cuckoo chase his vernal year, The pewet wail, the starting redbreast sing, And e'en the flutter of the warbler's wing, When the bough bent beneath his sudden flight— Though blind, not lonely in her changeless night; Then would she chide sad thoughts; and o'er her cheek A smile would steal, so gentle and so meek, And her blue orbs, though rolling sightless, gleam'd With such mild splendour, that, almost, she seem'd In love with darkness, like the insect things That hide the gorgeous ruby of their wings In emerald gloom, beneath the greenwood tree, And sleep, shade-loving hyacinth, with thee! Yet would she tremble in her fearful joy, As wan flowers droop when April frosts annoy. She felt a sad foreboding in her heart, A dread that, oft dismiss'd, would not depart. Blind and beloved, she smiled through tears, resign'd; But, ah! she fear'd to be despised and blind, Yet scarce knew why! Alas, her fears were true! Soon, scorn'd, she droop'd—O say not hated too! How oft doth Baseness to his victim say, “Why should the wretch receive, who cannot pay?” Ne'er had Ingratitude his plea to seek, And cowards love to trample on the weak; And still the helpless, when most aid they need, Die of neglect, (sad ill!) and slowly bleed, By drop and drop, in silent, lone distress, Till the heart swoons into forgetfulness! More seldom, day by day, Charles sooth'd her woe; He came, she dared not own, in haste to go; But she would sigh, and, with suspended breath, Hear tones that were to her a dirge of death; Then, while they struck her heart and soul with blight, Try to believe she had not heard aright. Few were his questions, harsh were his replies, And deeply in his heart he cursed her sighs, And called his guilt misfortune. She became A thing unmark'd—though seen, o'erlook'd: her name Ceased to be heard—she vanish'd. Who inquired If she were dead or living? Undesired Came such inquiries; and one answer brief Met them, half-utter'd. Hopeless, in her grief, She sate in some dark corner, lone; and there, With restless lips, she mutter'd ceaseless pray'r, Or sigh'd, unheard, “What will become of me?” But menial wrath, with vile indignity, And vulgar curses on her helpless head, Soon drove her to her unpartaken bed, Through the long night of nights and days to weep, Or start from slumb'rous dreams, but not to sleep. Yet was her trust in God unshaken still, And she endured, with meek-submitted will, Her heavy sorrows; nor of that worst pain, Love unrequited, did she once complain. Poor, sightless, trampled worm! for him she pray'd Who bade her droop, with none to soothe or aid; Her broken heart, already, quite forgave Him whose stern coldness had prepared her grave; And Charles, by dying Anna unreproved, When most unworthy, seem'd the most beloved! He, heartless wretch, and weak as base, made haste Her bridal portion and his wealth to waste; And suddenly, when all was gone, assumed Th' equestrian sword, and helmet sable-plumed. Strong blew the gale that o'er the heaving main Bore him to glory and embattled Spain; Where seldom thought he, 'mid conflicting arms, Of hapless Anna's sad, deserted charms. She to that house where want is fed by scorn, Too weak to walk, by hireling hands was borne; And there she found, with pain her couch to tend, A home, like that she left, without a friend. There, hourly dying, she forgot her woe, And smiled, with cheek of fire and lip of snow, On visions of the past. They, sad no more, Soothed her lone heart. Seem'd lovelier than of yore Her buried joys; and memory loved to gaze On their pale sleep. She thought of other days, When, with her Charles, (for still she called him hers,) By Broad-Oak's ice-cold rill, or Gunthwaite's firs, Through Cawthorne's bowers, or High-bridge wood she stray'd, Lost in her love, a happy, trusting maid, Where—while the jay, with freedom's pinion, shook The bind-weed's blush-tinged bells into the brook— Thrush answering thrush, piped sweet in fountain'd dell, And she could see the birds that sung so well. Meantime, dire fields were fought, and tidings came That the scathed eagle fled on wings of shame: Fight followed fight; she listened fearfully To every tale of death and victory; And oft and oft, all wan, she ask'd who fell, Dreading to hear a name beloved too well. Murmurs at length, then voices reach'd her bed; There was a letter from her Charles, they said. For the last time, like one risen from the tomb, She raised her feeble form: a transient bloom Flush'd her fall'n cheek: with intermitting breath She bent toward the messengers of death, As shipwreck'd seamen listen t'wards the land. She held, stretch'd forth, her agitated hand, Expecting, not believing, propp'd in bed On one lean arm, but less in hope than dread; With feeble shriek, she fell and tried to rise: And strain'd the letter to her sightless eyes, And kiss'd it o'er and o'er. But when she heard The written words, she lay like death, nor stirr'd, Grey tress, or wasted limb. “He told of flocks With fleeces fine, and goatherds of the rocks, And Spain's fandango, and the soft guitar, That sounds o'er treeless wastes to love's bright star, Calling the hind when day's warm task is done, To meet the dark-eyed daughters of the sun. He told of bayonets blood-incarnadined, Of distant battles booming on the wind, Of foodless marches, and the all-day fight, And horrid rest among the dead at night. Last named he servile servants of base ends, But call'd by him his dear and absent friends;” For they had pamper'd oft his mind diseased, Fed on his riot, and with poison pleased. And was this all? was there no postscript?—No: Named he not that dark flower inscribed with woe? Stern manhood, break thy sword, and blush for shame; He did not even write his Anna's name! With harrow'd heart that could be still and bleed, She listen'd when the reader ceased to read. In silent strength grief tore her soul's deep chords: Oh, what had wrongs like hers to do with words? And all who saw her wept at what they saw. Serenely pale, while all around her wept, She slept—she sleeps; but light shall yet arise, Th' eternal day-spring, on her sightless eyes; And Mercy yet may purify with pain That wretch beloved, and bid them meet again! He, when the trump of war had blown its last, Sigh'd and look'd back, repentant, on the past. In pale inaction, languid, he declined, And with the body sympathized the mind. Long-slumbering feeling waked, and waked to woe, Stung by remorse, the never-flattering foe, That triumph'd o'er his maim'd and toil-worn frame, As o'er the storm-struck ash the conquering flame. He thought of Anna, and his tears ran o'er— He thought of home, resolved to sin no more. So the poor Hebrew, long content to roam, The homeless wanderer, seeks at last a home; Quits the tall bark, and treads the hallow'd strand, His agèd consort leaning on his hand, Sedately glad, though tears bedim his eye, To lay his bones where Abraham's ashes lie. He climb'd the homeward ship, and blamed the wind, And blamed the waves, that seem'd to lag behind The bounding stern; till England, like a cloud, Dawn'd on the sight, where Heaven to ocean bow'd. He leap'd to land; and, wing'd o'er Snowgate's fern, Beheld again the valley of the Dearn, Cragg'd Hartley's broom, and Breton's shades below, And Clayton's cottage-smoke ascending slow. Down, down he hasten'd, pleased almost to pain, And felt as if become a boy again. Then fled the dream. Beside her cottage-door, Remember'd well for pranks play'd there of yore, He met a woman, lame and bent, whose breast Had pillow'd Anna's infant cares to rest— One who had taught him many a childish game. But when he paused, and ask'd that agèd dame, In tones that told the sudden dread he felt, Not if his Anna lived, but where she dwelt, Back shrank the crone, as from a thing abhorr'd; Then slowly forth she drew, without a word, The brooch which, erst, his ill-starr'd Anna wore; And, with a look that pierced him to the core, Placed in his hand (and turn'd abrupt away) A lock of faded hair, too early grey! THEY MET AGAIN. To the Man of Sheffield and our hearts—Thomas Asline Ward, Esquire—I inscribe this Poem. BOOK I. INTRODUCTION. Sad Laura! dost thou mourn with me The year's autumnal spring? Sigh'st thou this second wreath to see Of woodbines blossoming? So late, so pale, with scentless breath— Like lingering Hope, that smiles in death; And, e'en when life is o'er, Leaves on Misfortune's ice-cold face The sweetness of its last embrace To fade, and be no more. Lo! June's divested primrose sports A silken coif again; And, like late-smiling sickness, courts The coy morn, but in vain! Lo! half the elm's rich robe is gone! The ash, a living skeleton, Deplores his yellow hair! Yet, while the maple bows her head, In mournful honours fair, And while the beach-leaf rustles red, Methinks the armèd gorse appears More golden, than when May Left April dying in her tears, Beneath the plumy spray; And, for her lover's triumph won, Danced with her blue-bell anklets on, And bless'd his burning eye. Then, Laura, come, and hear the thrush, O'er Autumn's gorse, from budding bush, Pour vernal melody! Come! and, beneath the fresh green-leaf That mocks the agèd year, Thy bard, who loves the joy of grief, Shall weave a chaplet here; Not pluck'd from Summer's wither'd bowers, Not form'd of Autumn's hopeless flowers— Yet sad and wan as they: Here, still some flowers of Eden blow; But, deadly pale, and stain'd with woe, Like guilt they shun the day; While Folly treads beneath his feet The daisy of the vale; Love's rose, though sick at heart, is sweet— Joy's leaf is fair, though pale; And worth admires, resign'd and meek, The tear-drop on the violet's cheek, And hope shall death survive; But, like the gorse, all thorns and gold, Pride bids the sickening sun behold How blushing virtues thrive! Oft, Laura, have we seen (while dewy Spring Bent to the stockdove's plaintive murmuring O'er shaded flowers) the lone, wild apple-tree, With every bough carnation'd pallidly, In some bright glade, exposed to morning's breeze Some verdant isle, amid a sea of trees. It seem'd to live on heaven's own sweets, and call The wanton winds to kiss its blossoms all. But soon, like dewdrops in the brightening sun, Its fragrant soul exhaled—soon, one by one, Its petals, faded into whiteness, died; And, sweet in ruin, lay on Canklow's side— The snow of June. And thus, when time began His deedful race, the young enthusiast, man, In first intensest passion bless'd, could see, Where all was beauty, nought so fair as he; But from his cheek sin chased th' elysian glow, And turn'd the brightest hues of love to woe. O Sin! what havoc hast thou wrought on earth! To what abortions has thy womb giv'n birth! When first thy victim, man, conversed with pain, Love's purest spirit soar'd to God again, And murmurs issued from the bowers of bliss; But, when thy treachery poison'd in a kiss, Hell raised his hands, and mock'd the throne sublime; Hell scarce believed th' unutterable crime; Heaven's brightness faded; and, with sadden'd eye, The blushing angels sigh'd—“Adultery!” In yonder glen, beneath the aspen lone, A matron sleeps, without memorial stone; And children trip unconscious o'er her grave, Where, through the long grass, steals the lucid wave. When earth was dark with fear, and, lost and seen, The high moon glanced the hurried clouds between, Like some blood-guilty wretch, who, self-exiled, Wakes in the dead of night with anguish wild, And, o'er the tree-tops waving to and fro, Looks on the hopeless sea that moans below; Then stole she from her faithless husband's side, Sought Don's dark margin, sobb'd a prayer and died. He waked not, though a hand unearthly drew The curtains of his bed, and to the hue Of ashes changed his cheek. With open eyes, He slumber'd still; but speechless agonies Wrought on his face convulsed his heart's despair, And terror smote his damp, uplifted hair. His spirit felt a spirit's strong control, An injured spirit whisper'd to his soul— “No worm slinks down when I approach, No night-bird stints his ditty; Yet will I mourn thee, though unheard, For now my love is pity. Again I'll hear thee talk of truth, When Rother's rose is sweetest; Again I'll meet thee, perjured one, When thou thy new love meetest. While stars in silence watch my dust, I'll sigh, where last ye parted, O'er her who soon shall droop, like me, Thy victim, broken-hearted. And in that hour, to love so dear, The stillest and the fleetest, Unfelt I'll kiss my rival's cheek, When Rother's rose is sweetest.” O thou, whose wings o'er-arch the flood of years, That rolling, stain'd with crimes, and mix'd with tears, Whelms in his gulfs each unimmortal form; Spirit of Brightness! proud to span the storm! Thy word, O Love! bade light and beauty be, And Chaos had no form, till touch'd by thee! Though call'd of old the god of serpent wiles, Thou source of sweetest, bitterest tears and smiles, Thy voice endears to man the humblest home; Fair is the desert, if with love we roam. Where barks the fox, by golden broom o'erhung, Where coos the fern-fowl o'er her cowering young, Thee gloomiest rocks acclaim, with greeting stern, To thee the uplands bow their feathery fern: Shaking the dewdrop from his raptured wings, The waking thrush salutes his mate, and sings; With amorous lays the glad lark climbs the sky, And Heaven to earth pours down his melody. But in thy name when erring mortals sin, A plague, a cancer, blackens all within, Till life groans loud his hopeless load beneath, And the soul darkens into worse than death. Then Love's meek question meets with no reply, Save the fierce glance in hatred's sullen eye: Sad is the day, and sleepless is the night, And the rose poisons like the aconite. Earth's verdant mantle is become a shroud; Sweet Eden's blushes vanish from the cloud; The rural walk, that pleased when life was new, Where pendent woodbines grow, as erst they grew, Can please no more; the mountain air is dead; And Nature is a book no longer read. Suspicion, scorn, contention, treachery come, And all the fiends that make a hell of home. Sold to the Furies, ever glad to buy, Perchance lost man makes haste to kill and die, Uplifts the assassin's dagger, and lays low His idol, once adored, though hated now. Then Horror's harpy hand, and gorgon scowl, Rend the distracted tresses of his soul. He hears sad voices in the silent air; Heaven seems a marble roof, that spurns his prayer, Oh, for oblivion, he would barter heaven! And self-forgotten need he be forgiven? In thought he sees the midnight stake, the tomb Delved by the highway-side, in starless gloom, And the swift bullet flash'd into the brain; Or robèd Justice and her awful train; The fetter'd limb—the dungeon's agonies, The scaffold—and the thousand thousand eyes, All fix'd on him, whose head despair hath bow'd, Whose heart is all alone in all that crowd; And like a hooted traitor, wild with fears, Who sheds from eyeless sockets blood for tears, While, raining curses on his guilty head, The rabble shout him to his death of dread; Chain'd through the soul, he moves, in anguish blind, And drags remembrance and remorse behind. Sad as the marble forms on frailty's tomb, The few surviving flowers of Eden bloom; And must the serpent, Falsehood, hide, beneath Their petals dim, the fang whose touch is death? Hence to the fiends, thou glistering, fatal Asp! By the long transport of thy parting clasp, Then most adored, when falsest fear'd or found, By thy dear coils around the true heart wound! By suffering weakness, punish'd for thy guilt, By all the blood which thou hast damn'd or spilt! And, by the victims, who implore thy stay! False Asp, that poisonest Love! away—away! Hence, serpent, to the fiends! or darkling, rave In Bothwell's form, o'er Mary Stuart's grave! Shed o'er her dust thy tears of blood and fire, And in repentant agonies, expire! So shall distrust from Love's elysium fly, So, the worst fever of the soul shall die, With all the woes that Herod's ghost could tell, And Mariamne—loved, alas! too well! But doom'd with Time to perish, yet shalt thou Wrinkle with many a snaky fold his brow. Though from his snowy pinions, never dry, He hourly shakes the tears of poesy, While woe shall weep, his wings are shook in vain, And every plume must wear its pearl of pain. To bards unborn thy deeds shall furnish themes More sad than death, more dire than murder's dreams. No fancied Muse do I invoke to aid The song that tells of trusting truth betray'd; Be thou, my Muse, thou darkest name of woe, Thou saddest of realities below, Love!—But I call'd not thee, thou Boy of guile, Cruel, though fair, that joy'st to sting and smile! Sly urchin, wing'd and arm'd, too, like the bee, And tressed with living gold—I call'd not thee! But thee, sweet profligate, who gavest all— Peace, earth, and Heav'n—for poison'd fire and gall! Thee, thee, thou weeping Magdalene, I call! Alas! o'er thee hath rush'd th' avenging blast; Through thee the arrows of the grave have pass'd! Avaunt! thou palest daughter of Despair! If thou art Love, what form doth Horror wear? Yet stay! I know thee: in thy faded eye The light of beauty lingers—soon to die: Known by the worm that feedeth on the heart, Stay, guilty Magdalene! we must not part Till I have told this saddest tale of thine, And steep'd in tears each slow, complaining line. For what is sinful passion, but the lamp That gilds the vapours of a dungeon damp, And cheers the gloom awhile, with fatal light, Only to leave at last a deeper night, And make the darkness horror? Yet for this, This shadowy glimmering of a troubled bliss, Insensate man, peace, joy, and hope foregoes; Reckless, he plunges into cureless woes, Buys fleeting pleasure with enduring pain, And, drunk with poison, weeps to drink again. BOOK II. How, in this wild night, fares the malcontent? Beneath what pine, by bolt and whirlwind rent, Seeks he to shelter his devoted form? Or, on what rock does he contemn the storm, And shrink from human faces? Cromwell dead, And Charles restored, to northern isles he fled, And vainly hoped (a cavern'd wolf) to dwell, Where reigns the monarch eagle o'er the dell, In hideous safety. But the billows wide Yearn to divulge the restless wretch they hide; And ocean doth but mock him with the roar Of waves cast high between him and the shore Of verdant England. Wander where he will, Proclaim'd a traitor, dogg'd and hunted still, Swift comes the end, a struggle and a groan, Death by the hangman's hand, or by his own. There is a cavern midway in the rock That bears, unmoved, the wave's eternal shock; 'Tis called the Pirate's Den: gigantic stones Hide the dark entrance; and above them groans, In every blast, a time-defying-tree, Twin-brother of the crag. Sublimity, Lean'd on his arm, beneath it sits, and sees The bay of shipwreck, where the woful breeze Murmurs, prophetic of the seaman's knell, And screams the petrel o'er the hollow swell. Full many a shrub, sequester'd, blooms around; The cluster'd Loveage decks the rugged ground; And o'er the rustic carpet, wrought in flowers, The osprey's wing a snow of blossom showers. It is a scene so lonely and so fair— The winds, enamour'd, love to loiter there, Stoop to salute the sea-pink, as they pass, And coldly kiss the ever-waving grass. The roof within, Cathedral-like, ascends Sublimely arch'd and vaulted high, and bends O'er pillars vast its sparry curtains grand, Whose gems unnumber'd shine on every hand Bright as the plumage of a seraph's wing: Behold a palace meet for Ocean's King! But he who lies in troubled sleep beside The central fire, that casts its radiance wide, Making with darkness and reflected light A starry roof, and imitated night, Most awful in its grandeur—What is he? What slumbering wretch, escaped the stormy sea, Who, when his comrades sank to rise no more, Sent his wild laugh th' affrighted billows o'er? What mortal slave of sorrow, love, or hate, Cast on the strand alive to execrate The storm that was not fatal, and the wave That did not make the howling foam his grave? 'Tis Moreland, passion's victim from his birth, Who, like the murderer Cain, hath roam'd the earth. He, self-deceived, deems man a dungeon'd slave, While Fate, the gaoler, hears the captive rave; Smiling to see him roll his eyes in vain, And grind his teeth, and shake th' insulting chain; And writhe in fury, like a self-stung snake, And stamp upon his tombstone but to wake The echoes of his prison-house of woe. Victim of passion! hast thou found it so? Evil must come of evil; and, too late, Thou call'st the fruit of crime and folly, “Fate.” Sleep, but not rest! Lo! o'er his features spread An earthly darkness grows; and pallid dread Smites every lock and every limb amain. His bristling hair is damp with fear and pain; And while without the deepening thunders roll, He seems to hear the tempest in his soul. O God! 'tis dreadful! Nature's self doth quake As though her final hour were come; and shake E'en like the felon, whom th' offended laws Have doom'd to die. And now the soundless pause Locks the suspended soul in icy fear, While Conscience whispers, “God, thy hand is here.” Again the billows are conflicting light: The evil Angels have a dance to-night, That shakes the centre! O'er the booming bay Again the sound, re-echoing, dies away; And still that sleeper trembles! In his dreams Sees he the flaming storm that wildly gleams O'er ocean's wildness? Wretch! no common woe Hath stamp'd the curse of Cain upon thy brow. Hark! in those horrid accents shriek'd Despair! He rises:—Hath the lightning singed his hair? Lo! from the ground he leaps in pale surprise, And veils, with lifted hands, his dazzled eyes; And now he starts to find himself alone! The hideous phantoms of his sleep are gone: In low and interrupted words he speaks His troubled thoughts; and to the wave that breaks Heard in the pauses of the storm below, Mutters his guilt and recollected woe. “Again I am alone. Long have I been Alone in crowds, and alien to the scene Where the world's bustling minions shoulder'd me, Outliving joy and hope itself, to be My own tormentor; and in vain to curse The heart's blank solitude—a hell far worse Than that which bigots fear. I have endured, I still endure—though not in hope; immured, In dark reflection, scowling on the past, Fearing the future; and, if man is cast, Like a frail weed upon the waters wide, Rising and falling with the faithless tide, Life is endurance. Best is he who sinks, And sinks at once. The humble floweret shrinks, And dies uprooted when the gloomy hour Holds converse with the storm. But, cursed with power, Th' etersial pine, coeval with his rocks, In gloomy stateliness triumphant, mocks Heaven's baffled wing; yet stands, with tresses rent, Tremendous, undesired, a monument Of vengeance! O'er calamity and crime, O'er feeling victor, I arose sublime And tranquil, though terrific. Now I roam Where pirates lurk, making the sea-bird's home My alpine fortress, and the blast my page. To me the deep pays tribute in his rage. Me, on his rocks impregnable, the Hern Beholds in dread amaze; and from the fern Looks forth the astonish'd fox with fading eyes, Yells o'er the cliffs, and, wing'd with terror, flies. “Yet courage here avails, and everywhere, And all things may be vanquish'd, but despair; For, though 'tis vain to fly from certain doom, There is a Power which cannot be o'ercome— The dreadless heart that will not. Black and vast Let vengeance ride upon the rabid blast; Let the storm smite his hands together; loud The fiery bolt may thunder from the cloud— ‘But not for ever!’ Hope exclaims to Fear: ‘When night's cold cheek is coldest, morn is near: Beneath her heavy wind and pelting rain, Low droops the flower that yet shall smile again; And while the coward trembles in dismay, The brave look eastward, and behold 'tis day!’ “But I shall hear Hope's angel voice no more: Sternly I bear, as valour ever bore, The evil that admits no cure; and scorn All-shunn'd complaint. Hope saw Duration born, And never should desert him till he dies; But, falsely call'd the wretch's friend, she flies When man is doom'd with cureless ills to cope; All but the wretched have a friend in Hope. Yet while she smiles on Nature's common woe, And plants the storm with flowers that sometimes blow, Why should I rave, though here they will not grow? Alike averse to murmur and to weep, Still in despite of thunder, I can sleep, Though rest is for the happy. Come what may, The past is past, nor will the future stay, Though man, or fiend, or god obstruct her way. “I wore my youth in dreams on Pleasure's breast; My sleep was sinful, and I woke unbless'd: Most wretched, and deserving so to be, I darkly suffer, but not sullenly. I have rejoiced and sorrow'd; I have proved Th' extremes of fate, ‘have loved, and been beloved.’ What fallen angel, not without a tear, And piteous wafture of that hand most dear, And frantic locks, and looks where love yet lives, Smiles on my soul, and pities and forgives, Even while she mourns the hour when first she fell To guilt and shame? I know thee, wrong'd one, well! Cursed be the tongue that utters ill of thee! I found thee fond as fair: and I will be Still faithful to thy memory, and disdain The lying penitence of fear and pain. Ye woodbine bowers, where oft, with throbbing heart, We met in ecstasy, in tears to part! Oh, woods of Darnal! ye no more shall see The matron tall who loved your shades for me; Love-listening Rother, thou wilt hear no more Her guilty whisper on thy silent shore! As when she trembled, hung her head, and wept, Sweet as the flower on which the moonbeam slept, Wan as the snow-white rose in Catliffe's vale, But not, like it, in stainless meekness pale. Scenes of my youth! 'tis sadly sweet to look Back on your paths, and read, as in a book, Where painting's magic brings the path to view, A witching story, mournful and too true; A tale of other times, when life was young, And passion's heavenly harp was newly strung. “Yet deeds on memory's faithful tablet live Which man cannot forget, nor God forgive. Still to my soul returns the hour deplored When I became a traitor, fear'd, abhorr'd, And fiercely fought, and fought against the throne, By gloomy, envious malice urged alone. No love of freedom fired my stormy breast: I deem'd the patriot half a fool at best. I scorn'd his shallow hope, his honest zeal, I mock'd the virtues which I could not feel. No sacred ardour sanctified the deed, And nerved my arm to make a tyrant bleed; But a base lust to trample on the great, A fiendish instinct, a demoniac hate. “Whence was that sound? It came not from below; There none but wanderers of the waves can go: Hush!—many voices hath the stormy sea. I tremble—do I tremble causelessly? Death, I have heard thy shout, and seen thy frown, When stooping Slaughter mow'd his thousands down; And I have couch'd beside the sever'd limb, When Horror call'd on night to cover him, And thou wast dreadful then. But for this hour Hast thou reserved thy soul-subduing power: Thee never, Death, did I invoke, but still I bow'd to mightiest circumstance my will; And, in the darkest hour and stormiest shade, Look'd ever calmly for the dawn delay'd. Yet would that thou hadst laid me with the slain, Where England's bravest fell on Marston's plain; Little they fear'd thee, King of Terrors, then, Now not at all: for in the war of men They fought, and, shouting, died. But thus to meet Thy certain aim, and count thy coming feet, While the half bloodless heart forgets to beat— To meet thee thus, O Death! is terrible! Hush!—the hoarse cry is drown'd in ocean's yell. Hark!—voices, murmurs, and the steps of men! What! will they storm the lion in his den? Hither my evil Angel led my feet, And here deserted me. But, from retreat Cut off, I still can rush upon the foe; And bold shall be the arm that lays me low,” He said, and rush'd into the darkness lone, And from his scabbard flash'd his falchion, known By many a deathful deed in fields of blood, Where guileful Cromwell's iron warriors stood Like wave-girt rocks that spurn th' assailing sea. Through rifted clouds the moon look'd fearfully, On ocean's mountain'd plain and frantic foam, And rocks and caves—the ocean-prowler's home. He listen'd—but he heard no human sound; He spoke—but none replied; he gazed around, And half expected, on night's rushing wing, To meet the frown of some unearthly thing. Lo! in the light a dangerous pavement lay, Bright, dewy, cold, th' eternal marble grey! And, at his feet, with bare and hoary head, Expiring, gasp'd the object of his dread. O'er no arm'd spy, by kingly vengeance sent— O'er dying Age reclined the Malcontent, Raised in his arms the panting wretch he bore, And laid him on the cavern's gleaming floor; But as he stoop'd beside the fire to bare The ice-cold limbs, and wring the dripping hair, Glanced o'er the stranger's brow his troubled eye, And, shuddering, he arose, and raised a cry Of terror; backward sinking on his knee, With lifted hands, like one who starts to see The features of the murder'd on his way, And, bent on flight, but palsied by dismay, Falls chain'd to what he dreads. Why shrank the bold, Appall'd by weakness, weaponless, and old? Because he saw in that expiring man An injured friend. In youth their love began— A love that, save in Heaven, could not endure; So warm it was, so passionately pure, More like the love of angels than of men; And both were bless'd, for both were guiltless then, And one was guiltless still. He, wise in vain, Sow'd hope and love, but reap'd despair and pain; And too severely wrong'd to be forgiven, Now stood between the Malcontent and Heaven. By seas divided, and by years of pain, To part for ever, lo! they met again! And Moreland's gloomy spirit seem'd to mourn O'er hopeless hours that never could return, And listen to a sweet and soul-felt tone, That long, long lost, vibrated to his own. The wintry frost of sixty hapless years, All dark and sunless, melted into tears: He watch'd the struggling sufferer where he lay, And wept as he would weep his heart away. BOOK III. 'Tis morning; o'er the billows glimmers grey, The growing light of slow advancing day; Restored to life and thought, the wanderer hoar Wakes in the cave high-roof'd on ocean's shore. Stretch'd near the fire above the restless waves, With many a pause between, he weeps and raves; Now sad his speech and low—now wildly loud; And near him Moreland sits in sadness bow'd, Turning, at times, his alter'd face aside, The growing trouble on his brow to hide; Oft through his fingers and the gushing tear He views his guest; and tawny gleams of fear Course his sad check, and to his gloomy eye Give milder light and tamed ferocity. But when, with counterfeited voice, he strove To soothe the dying sufferer, and remove His mind's disease, and health's destroyer—fear— Bidding him hope there yet was comfort near, And that he yet his distant home should see— Then Eustace raised his eye of misery, And fix'd it on the speaker, with a look That from his cheek the sickly yellow took, And left it white. “But what art thou?” he said; “My languid eyes, with death's dim films o'erspread, Scarce see thy face; yet I, on some far shore, Have heard, methinks, that hollow voice before.” “Nay,” answer'd Moreland: “for, from youth to age, Here have I dwelt in this my hermitage; And made my feet familiar with the glens Of unclimb'd mountains, and the perilous dens Where the wolf sleeps, and wilds, since time began, Untrodden, save by me, a homeless man.” “'Tis well!” said Eustace; “and, my friend unknown, Thou soon again shalt sojourn here alone. A little while, and thou with up-piled stones And scanty earth, shalt sepulchre my bones. Oh, I have long conversed with sighs and groans! Long—I have been acquainted long with tears; And I am old, and older than my years. But tell not me of home. I have no home— The wretched can have none. I love to roam A wanderer from myself; and, had my soul Wings, I would fly beyond the farthest pole— Yea, cast behind me earth and every star, And dwell in soulless, lifeless space afar. Home, saidst thou? To the grave, thou babbler—go, And ask the worm what home hath hopeless woe? Home!—what is home? O read the answer here! Tis not the hearth, but that which makes it dear. I dream'd of such a home—that dream is gone; And now I seek my home—the silent one; For life is joyless, hope is fled, and fear; Death, death alone remains—and he is near. Life's glow, departing, yet informs my cheek; Feeble, not feeblest. I have strength, though weak, Enough to feel, in Nature's fainting strife, More than all pain—this weariness of life. O Death! how long? O let me—let me die! There is a love eternal in the sky; And there I may forgive—perhaps forget. I do not curse—I will be patient yet; Though they whom most I scorn'd contemn'd me most, I will be patient—Will? Oh, while we boast Our woe-tried constancy, we but sustain, Because we must, inevitable pain! “I know it well—I know I rave in vain. What brought me hither, say'st thou? Love and hate, A faithless friend, a woman, and my fate. I once was rich, nor dwelt beneath the sky A flatter'd fool more fortune-cursed than I; And Love's false morn was bright, too bright to last: But, when the dogs bark'd at me as I pass'd, And worldlings, if they met me, travell'd fast, Ann tore at once the bandage from my mind; I gazed on truth, and wish'd my heart were blind! “I was undone! by Ann and all forgot; Cold—naked—hungry—and she sorrow'd not; Distracted—and she soothed not my despair; Sick, and in prison—and she came not there. Night was around me, and I wept alone, Despised, neglected, left unheard to groan. But when I rose out of the earth, and light And Nature's face rush'd lovely on my sight, How did the bosom-serpent greet her mate?— With looks of rancour and with words of hate; And wretch she call'd the wretch herself had made. She cursed me to my weeping eyes—she bade My children curse me! and I wish'd again To hear the clanking of my dungeon chain. But Julia was the sweetest child of all: She kiss'd, she bless'd me, she alone did call Her mother's husband ‘Father!’ While the rest, Jane and Matilda, (though my own,) express'd No joy their sire's long-absent face to see, Julia—the youngest—Julia welcomed me! Dear Julia!—on my broken heart she smiled; Dear Julia!—wherefore was not she my child? “But never will I drink again from cup Made by the skill of mortal. I scoop'd up The water in the shallows of the sand, And drank it from the hollow of my hand. Nay, do not think that I myself deceive, But trust what I, in horror, must believe. They gave me poison in my drink; and he Smiled as I drank it; and—O misery! I burn'd and lived; I burn'd—and yet I live. God, in thy mercy infinite, forgive— Forgive them if thou canst! and I will try— Will wrestle hard to pardon both and die.” Breathless, he paused; and Moreland tried again To soothe with gentle words his bosom's pain; And bade him hope, since life's worst ills were o'er, Heav'n yet had earthly good for him in store. “Good?” Eustace cried—“O speak of good no more! It is a word that I have heard of—‘Good?’ O name it not to me! I understood Its import feelingly when life was new, And faith a child; for then my Ann was true. But now I have no name. An eaglet fledged, Or, like the homeless tempest, privileged To wander where I will, I breathe on her Forgiveness, mix'd with curses; and prefer, Before all roofs of faithless man, the sky, And envy every wild bird's wing on high. A moment she was mine—one bright brief hour; And then she fled in darkness! Like a flower, Dropp'd from an infant's hand into the deep, She left my bosom, and to troubled sleep Consign'd my dreams. A vision bright and brief, Joy fled to come no more! and, like a leaf Shook from the bough when winds of winter rave, I float and whiten on the desert wave. “Thus was I left, but not alone, to sigh. Though sickness quench'd the light in Julia's eye. My Julia faded. Mine?—she died, at last, And then the bitterness of woe was past; For I had loved her better than my own, Because she kiss'd me, when my soul bow'd down By rancour's curse despair'd. I follow soon; My day of life wanes nightward fast from noon, And evening lowers. Yet, once more let me gaze On ocean, stretch'd in wild morn's clouded blaze. For Ann and I (she lov'd thee, Ocean, well) Have watch'd on other shores thy hollow swell, So brightly blue, so beautifully bright, When every billow was a ridge of light, And light seem'd life. But she will hear no more The tumult of thy loud-resounding shore: I follow next, for she, too, went before. O native scenes, I see ye in my soul! O England, green, where southern billows roll! Ye towers of Sheaf, where royal Mary wept! Ye banks of Don, where oft my childhood slept! Ye giant oaks, that, from the adder's cliff, Frown'd o'er the dark wave and my gliding skiff! Thou, Wincobank, on whom the golden cheek Of eve rests loveliest! and ye hills of Peak, That softly melt into the airy blue, And hear the lark beneath—adieu! adieu!” Here paused he; but ere long, in accents low, Resumed, with dying lips, his tale of woe; As, whispering, thro' the gorse on Bretland's breast, The dark March tempest sighs itself to rest. “Oh, she was foul and fair! Yet once her mind Was lovely as her face; and if the wind Ne'er kiss'd a ringlet on a fairer cheek, Her spirit once was, as the twilight meek, And, as the wild flower's blushes, innocent. Yet to the grave with spotted name she went, Before the faces of astonish'd men. I saw her strive with death, and wept not then. She wept—and raised her trembling hands in pray'r, And mine were raised with hers; for I was there, E'en by her bed of pain. I saw the fear Of death convulse her frame, and in her ear I whisper'd hope. Then from her bosom broke Sad thanks in sighs, and, sobbing loud, she spoke: ‘Pardon'd by thee, I seek my shameful grave: Oh, still, my Lord, thy injured heart forgave! Tender and true, though sever'd from my hate, Thy love still lived, and sought no second mate. O may I meet thee in those realms divine! Or is eternal Mercy less than thine? Yet will I love, and hear thee—see thee still; And woe shall bow to my triumphant will. Yet will I snatch thy whisper from the gale, And o'er the gates of sin and death prevail. What chain can hold the disembodied mind? Grim hell may torture thought, but cannot bind. And when, released from this disastrous clay, To happier regions thou shalt wing thy way, My soul, by rigid Justice unforgiven, Shall weep, an outcast on the verge of heaven; At distance see my children wander free, And never bid adieu to them or thee!’ “I pour'd into her soul Religion's balm; I watch'd her awful silence, and was calm; And when she raised her eye, resign'd and meek, Warm on my wither'd hand, and woe-worn cheek, I felt her last—last tear. She spoke no more: The sinful sufferer's many pangs were o'er, And mine scarce felt. I heard the shovell'd clay Fall heavy on her bier. I turn'd away With bursting heart. Lo! as my head I bow'd I saw th' adulterer in the homeward crowd! But, like a frozen sea, on which the wind Can raise no billow, slept my awe-quell'd mind; All angry feeling from my bosom fled, The passions all were chain'd—my heart was dead. “I may not lie where Ann in cold earth lies; But might I see again with these sad eyes The clay that is her pillow, they would close Happy to shut for ever on the woes Of such a world as this. I weep for her: I am not stone: she was a sufferer, And, though a sinner, yet a Magdalene: She died repentant, and was loveliest then. Oh, she was false to me! but I am true; And, when she died, we then were wed anew. The worms, the worms our bridal bed prepare; Long waits the bride—in vain! I come not there. Sever'd in life, still, still let death divide; Why should I slumber by the lost one's side? Yet, when the trump of doom shall rend the sky, And wake all sleepers, she shall meet an eye That could not meet hers frowning. Oh, her breast, Though dearest still, is spotted and unbless'd: No pillow meet for me, although I long for rest! “Let me not doubt God's justice! Oh, what fate Pursues my race, as with a demon's hate? Evil must come of evil! that I know; But how have we incurr'd this shame, this woe, This desolation? How long must I bear This fever of the soul, and, in despair, Invoke the worm that will not come and feed? Still, still I breathe, while woes on woes succeed. Happy in this, Ann did not live, like me, To mourn her daughters' guilt and misery. Lured by two villains from their native shore, By me pursued in vain, and seen no more, They fled—they left me, hopeless and alone, To curse their birth, and name them with a groan. As back I voyaged, the tempestuous wind Bow'd the tall masts, and heaved the seas behind; The thunder knew me, the flash look'd me through, The billows wild the man of sorrows knew; And ocean would not spare one friendly wave To whelm my misery in a briny grave. Dash'd from the reeling deck by surge and blast, I sunk—I rose—I reach'd the strand at last. And when thou found'st me on the rock's cold brow, I was not sure if then I dream'd or no: From mile-high crags, girt midway by the storm, Th' adult'ress seemed to hurl my faded form; And thou might'st deem the fierce and parching wind Had left of me no trace, save dust behind— Wan dust, on which a viewless finger cold Had traced the lines that all with dread behold. “Why dost thou turn away thy brow severe? Why would'st thou hide from me thy generous tear? The rock's dark tenant melts at my distress! Thou weepest, cavern'd king of loneliness! Alas!—but no, it cannot be; for thou Didst rove, thou say'st, in childhood, on the brow Of star-loved mountains hoar since Time began Pathless and wild, and seldom sought by man, Thou say'st, I have not known thee; and mine eyes, Dim as my troubled spirit, recognize In thee distinctly nought; yet—oh, thy scowl Brings back a wintry darkness to my soul, Like the remembrance of a dream, that leaves No definite impression, while it grieves The heart that feels, and long will feel, how dire, How black it stood, and what a livid fire Gleam'd o'er its features of obscurity! Or, like the sea, when midnight storms are high, Heard, but not seen, while terror on the shore Sees the gun flash, but cannot hear its roar; And long with eyes strain'd dizzy o'er the main, Vainly expects to hail that flash again! “Farewell, kind tenant of the ocean's cave! I hear no more the restless billow rave. Thy features vanish from my view: I reel, From sense to gloom. What is that I feel, Foretelling stranger feelings yet to be, Ere all is past? A shuddering agony That is not pain. O thou most terrible! Thou nothing, that marr'st all things! canst thou tell, When from the block the sever'd head falls low, And glaring eyes seem conscious of the blow, And quivering lips in soundless words complain, What pangs may writhe the agonizing brain, Where thought, perchance, still lingers? I shall know Soon the deep secret, veil'd from all below, And what the dying feel when sense is dumb:— Thou beckonest me, black angel! and I come.” Thus, in the ocean-cavern's glimmering light, To Moreland spake the wanderer of the night. Question'd in vain, his words replied no more; But Moreland bent the lifeless body o'er, Fix'd in the mute intensity of pain, And lived, in thought, his past years o'er again. What, hopeless rebel! would'st thou give to be Wrong'd, like thy victim, and as pure as he? WITHERED WILD FLOWERS. To the Author of “Essays on the Formation and Publication of Opinions”—the Bentham of Hallamshire—as a tribute of respect, unworthy, but most sincere, I dedicate this humble Poem. BOOK I. Don, like a weltering worm, lies blue below, And Wincobank, before me, rising green, Calls from the south the silvery Rother slow, And smiles on moors beyond, and meads between. Unrivall'd landscape! Oh, it is a scene That to remembrance brings the hope-bless'd days, But not their hope! And at my feet, serene And cold lies he, and deaf to mortal praise, Who from this mount, erewhile, rejoiced to gaze; Who in this temple, plain and unadorn'd, Duly as Sabbath came, throughout the year, The word of Him in Jewry heard and scorn'd, In Jewry scourged and slain, rejoiced to hear; While Age shed oft th' involuntary tear, And younger voices sweetly join'd to sing The warbled anthem, plaintive, soft, and clear, Till soar'd the soul on pure devotion's wing, And God look'd down, and angels, listening. Daughters of Memory! shall the good man sleep Unnoted, though immortal, in the grave, While forms of angel-mockery seem to weep, O'er tyrant vile, or viler willing slave? The lying line shall prosperous villains crave To bid their flatter'd baseness live again? Shall verse from sure oblivion try to save Each worthless name? and no unvenal pen Write, “Here lies Nature's child, the best of men;” The sire of that mourn'd youth, whose soul of fire Cherish'd in mine a spark that else had died, The love of Milton's song, and Ossian's lyre, And Burns, to glory's noblest sons allied? Cold o'er thy bosom shall the earthworm glide, Where communed oft that low-laid youth with me; And shall I hang my harp on Rother's side, For ever mute and stringless there to be, Teacher and Friend! without one strain to thee? Teacher and Friend, who bad'st me syllable Words cull'd from learning's page with weary eye! Thy patience taught me zealously and well, But could not teach, like thee, to live and die; To envy nought beneath the ample sky; To mourn no evil deed, no hour misspent; And, like a living violet, silently Return in sweets to heaven what goodness lent, Then bend beneath the chastening shower content. But thou no more, with eye refresh'd, shalt see The long-watch'd seedling from the soil aspire, Or bind the rose, or train the gadding pea; No more shalt thou for victor flowers inquire, Or proudly hear th' expected guest admire Thy gemm'd auricula, a growing flame, Or polyanthus, edged with golden wire, The poor man's flower, that lifts to humble fame, Till e'en in print appears his envied name. Who now shall tend thy plants, thy priceless flowers, Emblems of thee, but not more pure than thou? The morn shall miss thee, and the dewy hours Of eve deplore, as I deplore thee now; And Spring shall pass her hand athwart her brow, When not a gem of thine shall deck her hair, Then shake in haste the dewdrop from the bough, And to the spot where thou art laid repair; “Where is my Druid?” Death shall answer—“There!” How hopeless, happy Spirit, is the groan, When God calls Guilt from all his joys away! But heavenly-sweet is Music's saddest tone, When o'er the lyre of Love Death's fingers stray; Less sweet the sound, when winds of midnight play On that wild harp which well thy skill could frame. And when thy dust was mingled with the clay, To weep o'er thee, Affection—Friendship, came, And there was one who could not sob thy name! Thou, guest of angels, hast of praise no need; But I have need of thine and virtue's aid: And taught by thee each deathless lay to read, Shall I forget my teacher lowly laid? Though every strain of mine, alas! must fade, Like idle vapour on the barren sea, Shall I forget the Christian undismay'd, The meekest child of truth and purity? I sing of Death; and shall I not of thee? But unlike thee are Passion's sin-bound slaves, That tinge my song with beauty's blasted bloom, While to my saddest theme I call the waves Of farthest seas, and homeless storms, that boom O'er worlds of woods, a universe of gloom! Swamps, dens, and caves, beneath one boundless pall, Where serpents lurk, their passing prey to doom, Lone horror shudders at the grim wolf's call, And dwells barbarian Man, most savage he of all. Joy after woe, as after darkness light! And sad Newhaven will not weep to-night. O happy meeting! peace and valour meet, There is rejoicing in the town and fleet, Light in the windows, laughter at the board, For dire Metacom quell'd, and peace restored. Amid his warriors, Winslow sits in pride, With Kirk (his guest from England) at his side— A martial libertine, to falsehood true, Who tells of Milton much, and Cromwell too; Of Charles the Martyr, hapless and revered; And hunted regicides, who fled and fear'd. And there, too, smiling on his smiling friends, Yet pale with thought, the saint-like Elliot bends; Who to the naked Indian's leafy shed Proclaim'd the resurrection of the dead; And while the savage on his accents hung, Gave the bless'd Word of God another tongue. And beauty's brightest eyes are glancing near; Nor doth the sternly courteous cavalier From transatlantic charmers turn away, Or deem the British fair more fair than they; For, Roman matron in her port and air, There Portia sits; or is Cornelia there? Or Agrippina? not in widow'd weeds, But glorying in her glorious husband's deeds. 'Tis Mary, sharer of thy heart and bed, Danger-tried Winslow! And, with languish'd head, While scandal marks the trouble of her eye, Fix'd in desponding thought's intensity, Like guilt in sleep, or passion in his shroud, Though gay no more, still proudest of the proud, Tall Mary's taller sister sits beside Henley, the marksman, with the lip of pride. How changed, Senena, is thy downcast eye! He who knows wherefore, fain would whisper why; And sacrifice a maiden's all, her name, That coxcombs might exult, and prudes defame. Behold her cheek! Still, still it hath its rose— Alas! not that which freshens as it grows! But one whose sweets the heart will not forget— Pensive and fading, though not faded yet! Her soul seems frost-bound on its lovely throne, Like beauteous life by winter turn'd to stone: The impassion'd crystal wants but warmth and breath, And thought's expression lives and speaks in death; The icy charm, insatiate, we behold, While admiration feels his blood run cold. “If your wide wilderness of wants and woes,” Said Kirk to Winslow smiling, “can disclose, Amid its horrors, flowers superb as these, We need not wonder that your deserts please. Fair flowers, by Heaven! the stateliest too they are That ever bloom'd beneath Love's dewy star! But one, as if transferr'd from Paradise, And sorrowing for lost Heav'n, seems fix'd in ice; Her lofty graces win us, and depress, Awe while they charm, and chill with loveliness,” He said, and with a soldier's freedom gazed On sad Senena; who her eye upraised, And, with a glance around the circle thrown, In each heart's secret fear'd to read her own; While Mary's eye met hers, and took and gave Pangs, like remember'd freedom to the slave. “Fair, native flowers our rugged land adorn,” Said Winslow; “but my wife is British born. She, from the rage of civil discord, brought In childhood hither, scarce remembers aught Of sea-girt home; yet still that home is dear, And England's praise is music to her ear.” “Madam,” said Kirk, “you wrong your native isle. England, defrauded of so bright a smile, When back she hails me from the sterile sea, Though rich in beauty, will seem poor to me. But pine you not at heart to see once more Your wave-rock'd cradle, our Britannian shore?” The matron answer'd—while her graver eye Reproved the soldier's fearless flattery— “In England, none who know and love me live; I have not there one living relative; And therefore feel I small desire to see The foam-girt land of my nativity; Where Cavalier and Roundhead hail and bless Charles and the law, whose rule is happiness.” “Yet here,” said Kirk, “by dangers compass'd round, Ye dread the Indian whoop in every sound. I am a soldier—I have look'd on blood; And, on the howling battle-field withstood Death's sternest menace; yet Metacom's deeds Appal my heart, that shudders while it bleeds, To hear the horrors of his butchery, Which spares nor stooping age nor infancy.” “For his defeat,” said Elliot, “thanks to heaven! Yet be the savage in the man forgiven. His loss our gain; as he descends we rise, And grow and spread, like flame, before his eyes. If every White Man aims at him a blow, Justly he sees in every White a foe; And, doom'd in combat or in flight to die, Does he not well to face his enemy? Sage, patriot, hero, king! for Nature's rights, Brave as our own Caractacus, he fights. Reluctant draws the knife, and heaves a sigh; Then wars on fate and possibility. For, arm'd to extirpate his hated race, The Whites shall hunt them o'er earth's blasted face; Till, in the ocean of the farthest west, The last Red Man shall shroud his bleeding breast.” “Where ruined Memphis,” Winslow said, and sigh'd, “Lies like a giant blasted in his pride; Where Tadmore droops, by herbless sands embraced, A childless mother in the houseless waste; Where old Athena, who can dever die, Speaks of the dead in wan sublimity; Where mourns th' eternal city, still a queen, The traveller weeps o'er glories that have been; There still the portals of the gods remain, By Desolation's mace assailed in vain. But here no column, with pathetic brow, While awe-struck Time reclines in tears below, To other years, and men unborn, shall tell Where more than Roman valour fought and fell.” “Their very name shall perish!” Henley cried, With bitter smile of factious spleen and pride; “Their very name shall perish! scorn'd by Time, Nor live a day, like courtly things in rhyme. Alas! few flatterers kneel prostrated low To him whose sole exchequer is his bow; And undeceived, unsung, that king may die Who hath no humbler palace than the sky.” Rebellious to his will, that strove to hide In cold indifference his offended pride, Kirk's darkening visage frown'd a mute reply, While Henley, pausing, fixed on him his eye; Then placing on his head his cap unplumed, Th' irreverent wrangler thus his taunts resumed:— “‘God save the King!’ our loyal wilds exclaim, But not, God save Metacom, poor and lame. Well know we, courtly sir, that Power is Right: The blind themselves see worth in wealth and might; For Power's adorers only worship Fate, And Power was never illegitimate. Strong is the king who reigns by right divine, And nobles round him cringe, for armies shine. Before him Justice sits, nor sleeps, nor winks, And vultures die, or no corruption stinks. For gaping crowds with liberal hand he carves, And merit at his table feeds or starves. A god on earth, and fear'd like him of hell, The good who serve him are rewarded well. Secure he reigns, untroubled, undismay'd, For loyal are his servants—and are paid.” Thus spoke he, factious—mischief his delight, Himself a compound of disdain and spite, To none submitting, and insulting all, Sedition on his lips, his life a brawl. He ended, sneering. Kirk turn'd black with ire, And on his forehead darkness seem'd on fire. Lo, as the courtier frown'd, Senena rose; Her soul was struggling with unutter'd woes; Pale on her cheek expired the blasted bloom: In Mary's eye sate discontent and gloom— And sad Senena, tottering, left the room. All wondering, gazed! But Kirk, with gloomy stare, Perused each sun-brown'd warrior's haughty air, And, starting, almost fear'd rebellion there. In Winslow's mien, a Lambert seem'd to lower— In Winslow's form, a Cromwell seem'd to tower! He shrank from Henley's shadow on the wall, And inly mutter'd, “Traitors are they all.” Frowning, he rose, and sternly waved adieu, And, mute and slow, retired. Then all withdrew, But not all silent. Boisterous Henley laugh'd; And too, too much of gall his heart had quaff'd, To spare the angry messenger of kings, And deem abuse and scorn forbidden things. Midnight was past; but not a streak of grey Dawn'd in the east, to tell of coming day. No murmur on the dreams of silence broke; The moon still slumber'd o'er the gospel-oak, Beneath whose shade Newhaven's fathers kept Their first sweet Sabbath, grateful while they wept To think of England, whence their steps were driven To worship in his wilds the God of Heaven. Blue, brightly blue, was night's ethereal hall, When, like a form that decks some temple's wall, And paler than the marble, wander'd forth Senena, the betray'd; and the cold north Play'd with her hair, that sought her feet below, And on her shoulders lay like night on snow. Crisp in the night-wind shook her single vest! The moon look'd calmly on her naked breast, And the wan stars beheld with awed delight, One like themselves, sad, silent, cold, and white. What magic was there in that courtier's speech, That words like his the secret heart could reach, And make the fairest of the fair and proud Appal with beauty midnight's darkening cloud? Or, did wan death, in poor Senena's form, Walk with unecho'd step, and quit the worm? Say, did that apparition breathe and glow? Did the heart heave beneath that breast of snow? I know her by that hopeless look and tear; 'Tis she, Senena's self: but wherefore here? When last that broad oak's branches o'er her moan'd, Low at the feet of Henley laid, she groan'd; Pray'd him to save a maiden's all—her fame; Pray'd him to snatch her from a grave of shame: And when speech fail'd, her tears, that silent ran, Implored a monster to become a man. But now—What burden bears she on her breast, And fondly bending, kisses into rest? A mother and no wife, she sobs forlorn O'er what she loves and dreads—her infant born In secret. Lo! three lovely, pallid things, Fairer than fancy's wild imaginings, Night, at this moment, as she sits alone, Sees from the silence of her starry throne— Like the swan's wing, Senena's cheek of woe; The moon, high-placed on heaven's majestic brow; And the moon's image on the waves below, That glimmers deep and still. Is it to lave Her raven tresses, that above the wave Senena bends? Athwart her outstretch'd arms They flow, and veil, but cannot hide her charms. Say, while recumbent o'er the wave she stands, Why heaves her heart with her extended hands? What sound, O God! was that? And, hark! a scream Succeeds that plunge. Lo! on the strangling stream, With head thrown back, erect she gazes there, While horror stiffens her uplifted hair; And her eyes gleam dilated, pale, and wild. Oh! hath she cast into the wave her child? That cry again! but fainter—and away She turns and flies; yet backward, in dismay, Instinctively to see some dreadful thing, She looks, and stops, intensely listening. A sob?—how feeble! and the little breast That heaved it forth is even now at rest; For, ah! where is the burden that she bore, Press'd to her bosom, and kiss'd o'er and o'er With such sad fondness? Horror hears her sighs: And, like a bird with wounded wing, she flies In haste yet slowly. She hath pass'd the hill; The echoes slumber on earth's bosom chill; Smooth flows the wave again, and all is still. Lo! she hath reached her chamber, in despair! And, scarce alive, she sinks into her chair, The stone-still image of all-dreaded death! Mary bends o'er her with suspended breath, And all is silence save the throbbing heart. Ah! bid pulsation from its fount depart! To hush the heart is woman's hardest task. How Mary's look inquires! What would it ask But what she knows too well, and dreads to know? Oh! which sad bosom feels severest woe? Which sister-mourner do we pity most— That lost one, or the wretch who deems her lost? The taper trembles on its little stand; Ah, no! Senena, with convulsive hand, Hath dash'd it out! and wan she bends in gloom: Burst Mary's tears! she rushes from the room. And now doth guilt sit lighter on thy breast, Poor, fall'n Senena? Sank thy heart, oppress'd, Dreading thy picture in a sister's eye, Dreading to meet a sister's scrutiny? Alas—alas! guilt fears to be alone! And wouldst thou hide in solitude the groan Wrung by remorse from conscience in despair? Oh, questions vainly urged! Nor force nor prayer Can stop Time's flight, and bid the present stay, Nor tears recall the deed of yesterday. No—no! but Heaven can pardon and deliver The suffering child of sin—O God! forgive her! BOOK II. Love!—but not Thou, whose mightiest Hand afar Guides in his printless path each wheeling star. Love!—but not Thou, our type of Heaven, whose breast Rocks beauty's rosiest babe in smiles to rest. Despairing Love, who long'st in blood to steep The bed where thou dost toss, and fain wouldst sleep! How like a lily, stain'd with murder's gore, Thy sorrow weeps! Yet, not for evermore Shalt thou, a flower distain'd with mourning, bend Through ages, rolling slow, of hopeless end; And while the funerals of the stars pass by, Still tremble in the blast of destiny. Thy guilt hath tears, though darkest guilt it be, And pitying Heaven hath mercy e'en for thee. It was the evening of a sunless day: Slowly the heavy vapours roll'd away, Pouring no more the rain. The weary gale Bow'd still th' indignant pine; and chill, and pale, And indistinct, each watery object nigh Wore the dim hues of distance to the eye. It was the hour that pensive thought loves best, The gloaming hour, when toil retires to rest, When music's voice is sweet as love's caress, When dying light is loveliest loneliness. When hope's tear flows more limpid than the dew, And tearless wretches try to weep anew, And find a joy in grief. While charged with rain, Each blossom droop'd—like innocence, in pain And silence, weeping—with desponding soul, Senena from her joyless chamber stole. Instinctively she sought the fatal shore, That saw a deed which she must still deplore, And turning from the past her hopeless view, Like Montfort, sigh, “Would, would it were to do!” She sought that fatal shore—but found not there Joy in her grief, nor hope in her despair: For evil tongues were busy with her fame, And conscience trembled at her whisper'd name. Hopeless, she long'd to mount th' unhallow'd bark, And sail the deep irremeable dark: On death she call'd, but with averted eye; The dead she envied, yet she fear'd to die. But not unwatch'd she went. She heard the sound Of well-known footsteps—yet she looked not round; And Henley stood beside her, blank in awe. Her hand from his she deign'd not to withdraw: He press'd it, while his own with fever burn'd; But hers, clay cold, no pressure soft return'd. Humbled, he ask'd, with shame unwonted, why Such dreadful coldness froze him from her eye, And why they met not? With averted air, The mourner heard; and, strengthen'd by despair, Stood in her silence. Yearning for the grave, She watch'd the tremble of the conscious wave That chilly clasp'd her babe of hapless love; And thought of Heaven, but dared not look above. Long thus, in mute abstraction, on the strand, Fix'd, stern, and calm, she moved nor eye nor hand. Unmann'd, he wept, and clasp'd, and kiss'd her knee: But, when he spoke of years of bliss to be, Of Love's sweet home, of Hymen's saffron morn, And that lost babe which yet he deem'd unborn, Then from her eyes the fire of madness flash'd, Her foot to earth th' astonish'd suppliant dash'd; Her anguish found a torturing voice, and spoke, And execration in her breast awoke:— “No lightning blasts thee!—sleeps avenging heaven! Go, ask His mercy, and die unforgiven! Nay, bloodless image of dismay'd surprise! Start not—I cannot stab thee with mine eyes: My hand, unweapon'd, spares thy worthless life; But, shouldst thou meet me when it grasps a knife, Be deadly wan thy cheek, and slack thy knee!” With glowing cheek, and awful energy, She spoke her words of madness and despair; And Henley heard them with a madman's air. Slowly he left her, wondering, stunn'd, appall'd. She gasp'd—she wept; she wish'd her words recall'd: So weak is woe! Worlds, worlds she would have given, Could he have heard her pray for him to Heaven— Could he have heard her say—“Though base to me, My dying lips invoke no curse on thee! No! live, and think of her who yet forgave, Though sent by thee a murd'ress to the grave. Live! when the charms that rivall'd once the rose, And rival now the printless snow, repose In that deep darkness which no midnight knows— Yes; when the hand that oft thy lip has prest, And this fond pillow of thy head, my breast, And these long-tearless eyes, that should not weep For one who hath no heart, shall moulder deep In misery's sure and last asylum—live! And may offended Heaven, like me, forgive.” Tears soothed her spirit; and relenting thought Half robb'd her of the dire intent she brought. But Henley heard not—saw not—on he went, Staggering and faint, like one with labour spent; And, flashing, rush'd his hot blood to his eyes. He fell—what phantoms from the earth arise? A form before him stood, in sorrow deep, And beautiful as angels when they weep. Wan, in the arms of that fair spectre, smiled, Cold as the breast that pillow'd it, a child, Whose half-closed lips the lifeless teat still prest; And, as the grateful infant sunk to rest, The blue eyes' languor stiffen'd into stone. “Kiss, father, kiss thy child!” with hollow tone A voice exclaim'd. “One kiss, and thou art clay! Freeze in a kiss: be cold, and come away! Husband, a marble lip thy sands hath told: Cold was thy heart to us, and we are cold.” He started up; and, lo! he was alone! The phantom mother and the child were gone, But not th' unutterable awe that froze Life in its fountain, as those phantoms rose. While the grey mountains bade adieu to day, Slow t'wards Senena's home he wound his way, Yet scarce knew why. His knees each other smote, And in his soul waked gloomy thought on thought, The darkest last. Like a bright bow unstrung Arose the crescent moon; but darkness hung O'er her blue pathway, on the sky pourtray'd In giant forms, slow moving, shade on shade. Lo! high in Winslow's dwelling beams a light! Far the ray flashes through the dusky night: Before the light a gloomy form appears, Reclined in troubled thought, perhaps in tears. 'Twas she, he thought, in woes and wrongs array'd, Undone and lost Senena the betray'd. “She weeps,” he said—“she weeps in her despair!” Who wept? Alas! Senena was not there! 'Twas Mary, pondering by the taper's gloom On poor Senena's crime—Senena's doom. She deem'd the lost one at that moment slept; She more than fear'd her guilty, and she wept. Senena did not sleep, she slept not yet: But still her cheek with soothing tears was wet: Almost she hoped that heaven might yet forgive; Almost she hoped, almost resolved to live; But, as she watch'd the quivering billows near, Her wan cheek darken'd with unutter'd fear: She shook and trembled like the restless wave— At once her infant's cere-cloth and its grave. The troubled curtains of portentous night Flung from their brightening folds a sudden light; The waters seem'd to chide her as she stood! A voice of mourning issued from the flood. She started—on the surface rose to sight A flower, a floating lily, bluely white: She shriek'd—she stoop'd—she snatch'd it to the strand; God! 'twas no lily—'twas a little hand! Forth from the brine she drew her murder'd child, The black rocks echoing wide her accents wild; Close, and more close, her ice-cold babe she press'd, And cold was comfort to her burning breast. She gazed upon it, (and her hot tears came,) Call'd it her child—it had no other name— Kiss'd its blue sodden cheek, its bosom fair, Its small round fingers, and its dusky hair; Then to her heart she clasp'd its lips of snow, And sobb'd, thrice happy in severest woe. She wonder'd at its loveliness in death; Scarcely believed she that it had not breath. Once more she bent, once more a kiss to take, And half expected that it yet would wake. And then the fire return'd into her brain: And memory wept, and conscience groan'd again; Wild, mutter'd accents from her bosom broke, And words came to her tongue, and misery spoke: “My murder'd baby! O that I had borne The taunt of prudery, the scourge of scorn, The penance due to sin! Would I had taught Thy little lip to know this breast, and bought Thy thankful smile with love; and o'er thee hung To bless the name of mother from thy tongue! Was this a mother's deed? Thy stifled cry Still echoes in my soul, and will not die. Bitter remembrance is my portion set, Never on earth to smile or to forget; And I must bear perdition in my breast, And wear my hopeless anguish as a vest. Why did I do this deed? Let Henley tell: He, most unworthy, still is loved too well; But he shall weep when I am lowly laid, And wish, too late, I had not been betray'd. Canst thou forgive me, baby? thou my child, Canst thou forgive this wretch with blood defiled? Baby, forgive me! I forgive thy sire— O Heaven, forgive us both! and, in thine ire, Remember him with mercy. Let me weep A little longer, ere I try to sleep.” She ended; and, with greedy eye, devour'd Th' expecting flood, while, on the dark heaven lower'd The cloud, behind which shrank the shaded moon. “Some natural tears she dropp'd, but wiped them soon.” Her long-lost mother to her thought arose: She yearn'd to meet her—where all griefs repose. Her sister's image, with imploring hand, Beckon'd her, shrieking, from the fatal strand: “Mary will weep—but she already weeps: And, when in death the lost Senena sleeps, Detraction will forget his useless gall, And all-atoning death will cancel all. Malice, herself, that watch'd my fading name, And hail'd with devilish joy my blasted fame, Even Malice to my grave with tears shall come, Even Envy's self forgive me in the tomb, Own frailty's sister to themselves allied, And cease to taunt pride's victim with her pride.” Did not her lover, lingering in her heart, Bid the black shadow from her soul depart? She thought of Henley with the lip of scorn, And poor Senena at his feet, forlorn, Fall'n from the throne of innocence to shame. Red to her cheek return'd th' indignant flame: She wept no more, but, kneeling, look'd to heaven, Then kiss'd her baby, and felt half forgiven. That lifeless infant, in this direst hour, Upheld her spirit with an arm of power, More close she clasp'd it in a last embrace, And plunged—still gazing on the lifeless face; Deeply she plunged, and o'er her closed the stream. Forth from her pall of clouds, with sudden beam, Casting o'er rock and wave a silvery hue, The moon walk'd bright into the heavenly blue. 'Twas then that Henley's homeward pathway led His footsteps near Senena's watery bed. The moonbeam lit his wild face as he pass'd; The billow sigh'd his name—he stood aghast! Perhaps Senena, in her dying pain, Repentant, wish'd to live, but wish'd in vain! Call'd she for help? or, too devotely true, Bade she to that loved wretch a sad adieu? He, bending o'er the rock in dread and woe, Beheld a snowy bosom sinking slow Beneath the wave, that quiver'd, as to tell, By speechless signs, a tale of horror well. Headlong he plunged; he grasp'd a stiffening hand; He dragg'd the mother and the child to land; Then kiss'd his victims as he wildly shook, Imploring one sweet word, one glance, a look Of mute forgiveness; clasp'd her senseless frame, And made the caverns vocal with her name, In vain repeated. On his lap he laid Her head, yet warm, though lifeless. He survey'd, Intensely still, the features. Pride was there That triumph'd over death, and in despair Looked like defiance arm'd: the brow was knit In sternness, and the locks that shadow'd it So darkly, moved not; on her lip sat pain, Fix'd in the strength that died in struggles vain; The large dark eyes, half shut in last repose, Waited, he thought, to look a curse, and close; And in her strong and dread embrace, she press'd Th' unconscious infant to her beauteous breast. He knew she named him with her dying breath; He deem'd she cursed him in the arms of death; He wrong'd, in ignorance, his murder'd love. Powerless and agonized, he tried to move His victims: back he fell, and senseless lay. Again he rose; but then the moon's last ray Was trembling dimly in the horizon grey: Through all his veins a deadly chillness crept, And like a boy, the shivering giant wept. Morn waked at length, without a cloud, and smiled O'er wood and wave, on father, mother, child; When Winslow took his wonted walk, to see The early sun quaff pearls from every tree; And t'wards the fatal spot advancing slow And pausing oft, he reach'd the scene of woe. What eye of man could view it unappall'd; He shriek'd in horror, and on Henley call'd; And Henley laugh'd in horror, from his head Shaking the dews of night; then on the dead With stone-still eye-balls stared, and ghastly stood. There is a laughter that can chill the blood; And, written on that brow, the wrath of fate Tells of a ruin'd mind, a heart all desolate. BOOK III. On fallen Senena's grave no grass is green; But near it, lo! an open grave is seen! And mournfully amid those mourners hangs On Winslow's arm, her sister; and the pangs Of sorrow live again, with strength renew'd; She sees the grave, she groans, in soul subdued, And, pausing, shudders. Slow, with heavy tread, T'wards his last home, the bearers bring the dead In awe and silence: and with pensive air, True to the last, Senena's dog is there. Now on the fresh mound, recent from the spade, Near the grave's margin Henley's bier is laid; And Kirk of England calmly folds the pall: He only, tearless, stands amid them all, Cold as the granite on some lonely tomb, Gilt by a sunbeam in the day of gloom; While Elliot—and each brow is turn'd to him, And not a listener stirs, or lock or limb— Faltering, with blinded eye and dewy cheek, Beneath the gospel-oak essays to speak:— “The curse of God is in the house of sin. Thus wisdom spoke; and thus a voice within (If careless mortals listen as they ought) Speaks to the silence of admonish'd thought. O that the grave had language! that the dead Could speak in thunder! and the page unread In every heart, unfold to every eye What all deplore, and struggle to deny! The grave hath spoken! and the dead do speak! Yes, harlot Pleasure, with the painted cheek, Thy victims, in their deeds and in their doom, Preach to our hearts, and teach us from the tomb; Loudly they tell the conscious thought within, Yet oft in vain, that sorrow's root is sin. “Nay, sorrowing Mary! spare thy tears: I feel My task is not to torture—I would heal The soul that bears, with such a stifled groan, So great a share in sorrows not its own. If Heaven's just wrath the worm of sin reproves, His wrath-like kindness chastens whom it loves. I need not prove what each tried bosom knows— That man is misery's heir, and born to woes. Oh, what a lesson reads the historic page To suffering man, in vain from age to age, Taught by recorded ills! And not the less Is human being pain and weariness, When unrecorded pass our race away, Like forest leaves—like clouds that dim the day, Like the flower's blush. But if the righteous here, Though not unbless'd, shed oft a bitter tear, Here and hereafter rich is their reward; While sin shall surely suffer; and debarr'd, By self-applauding conscience, from her heaven, Shall suffer unconsoled, and murmur unforgiven. “Man, without virtue, is a sunless day; A midnight cloud that bursts and rolls away; A flag that streams the waves of battle o'er, And sinks in fiery gloom to rise no more; A traveller wandering by the lightning's blaze On cloud-clad rocks, where day would dread to gaze, While horror listens with suspended breath, And all around is danger, doubt, and death. “Thou losing gambler, by thyself betray'd, Thy life a game, with crime and folly play'd! If the pure bosom is a temple bless'd— If heaven is throned in every righteous breast— Oh, by thy throb to bask in glory's blaze! Oh, by the passion for undying praise, That weds thy heart to human sympathy, And proves thee made for immortality! Sink not beneath the deep and treacherous wave, In which low passion plunges passion's slave; But swim with upward gaze on heavenly charms, And win eternity with mortal arms. “Oft cloudless day, ere noon, is overcast: Bright colours soonest fade. We know the past— We cannot know the future. Fair we deem Of what seems fair, and well and wisely dream That human good can last, though change is near To wake and mock us. And when guilt and fear Turn o'er th' unlook'd-on pages of the heart, Well we may shudder if the angels start And read in pale surprise!—In that sad tomb Lie youth and beauty blasted in their bloom. Let dust inform our hearts that sin is woe! Once—but my tears will flow; and let them flow! Nor would I be the only weeper here. My friends, ye also weep, and well the tear Becomes you. Jesus wept.—Ye modest maids, Loveliest in tears, like flowers that woo the shades! She once was bless'd and beautiful like you! Ye pure in heart, she once was spotless too! But, oh, when virtue flies, what demons come! Seize on her throne, convert her light to gloom, Pollute her altar with unholy flame, And of her temple make a den of shame! Now fall'n from fame, and lost to life, to all, Senena's worth seems cancell'd by her fall! For prone to blame, and rigid in pretence, Man forgets all things but lost innocence; And ne'er forgives, though Pity's self be nigh, The time-tried wretch that mocks his prophecy! “But Heaven is not forgetful. God is just; God weighs in mercy's scale our erring dust. This may he find, whose ashes there await The last sad rite that sorrow pays to fate. Ye knew him when no insect's gauzy wing More lightly flutter'd o'er the blooms of spring Than he, with thoughtless smile, and sunny eye, O'er every leaf, and stalk of vanity, That poison-breathing plant, with flaunting flower, Which loves to desecrate the fairest bower. What now avail thy sword and numerous scar, Thou sin-slain giant, with the hand of war? What now avails thy beauty, self-adored, That doom'd the loved one to a death abhorr'd? Methinks her dust should know thee, and upbraid Thy perjured vow, for trusting truth betray'd; Like that relentless soul—a shaded flame— That, in elysium, darkens at the name Of thankless Florence! But ye both are mute; She cannot be defiled, nor thou pollute The worm's pale sister. Yet, in hours like this, Most eloquent, O Death, thy silence is! And wordless truth, when seated on thy brow, Proclaims—and is believed—that sin is woe! “Was it not woe, when all-shunn'd Henley fled From every human eye?—to hide his head Where living thing ne'er shook a leaf, nor stirr'd The honey'd flower, save startled humming-bird? Where never sound disturb'd the horrid brake, Save thrilling warning of the rattlesnake? And ne'er to heaven was raised a glittering eye, Except the slow-wing'd eagle's in the sky? “Abhorr'd by all, he fled, yet not alone; Senena's faithful dog, with ceaseless moan, Follow'd his parting steps. Though oft driven back, Spurn'd, and yet true, the dog pursued his track, And found a welcome at his journey's end. Senena's dog became his humble friend, His sole companion in the dismal brake, And soon was loved for lost Senena's sake— The only thing on earth he now could love; And he would seat him in the tulip-grove And gaze in silence on the terrier's face, Till day, from morn to eve, had run his race. Unsocial savage! far from human sight— From human sound, he urged his gloomy flight, To rest on solitude his blasted breast; Farthest from man, the loneliest spot was best; Where sound was not, save ocean's distant roar, And motion, save the billows on the shore. The desert beckon'd to his mute despair; And if he was alone, what matter where? He loved to sit on crags, and hear the sound Of his loud rifle shake the waste around; Leaping from rock to rock, from wood to wood, O'er isthmus, isle, and long-resounding flood. And had not midnight to his lone retreat, Through starless darkness led my wandering feet, There, where he died, ‘without a hand to save,’ There would the wolf, beside the dashing wave, Have given his shroudless limbs a living grave. “Foot-sore, and weary, and in soul distress'd, I was returning from the travell'd west: The night was gloom unbroken; and I lost My way amid the many paths that cross'd The dangerous forest. Long and far I went Still more and more astray, and vainly sent My voice for help through echoing gloom abroad. At last a red light from a lone abode Flash'd through the kindling verdure. Vast and high The building darken'd on the starless sky. Deserted and all-tenantless it seem'd; And yet the brightness of a pine-fire gleam'd Wide from the centre of the ample floor. Apart I stood, and through the open door Survey'd awhile in fear that vault-like room: Its vast retiring depth was lost in gloom. I spoke—I shouted: from disturb'd repose, Behind the fire, a startled wretch arose, Casting his lengthen'd shadow far aloof, That, like a spell-raised giant, propp'd the roof; And, lighted from below, his features wan Seem'd such as fear would not ascribe to man. Like a stray'd captive by his gaoler found, His terror utter'd a despairing sound, While fast he grasp'd with both his hands, his hair, Gazing on darkness with a murderer's stare. Thick o'er his brow one raven lock was roll'd, And at his feet Senena's terrier howl'd. Slow I advanced; but, with averted look, And arms out-stretch'd, he shrank—then stood and shook: An infant might have fell'd him with a flower; For she, whom he had wrong'd in evil hour, Was present to his soul with dread and might; One, one wild thought absorb'd his spirit quite. Faintly he said, ‘I have expected thee; Come, let me kiss thy child, and cease to be!’ But when I named his hapless name, and grasp'd His rugged hand, with thickening throat he gasp'd; He look'd—and seem'd to fear to look again; And torturing memory rush'd into his brain. But when he saw the bright tear on my cheek, And when I bade God help him, accents weak Of thanks half-utter'd trembled on his tongue; Faint on my agitated arm he hung. The voice of kindness, mighty to subdue, Fell on his soften'd soul like heavenly dew; And when I pray'd for him, his heart look'd up; Hope faintly brighten'd in his bitter cup; He kneel'd, he kiss'd my feet, he sobb'd, he wept, And nearer to his guest the terrier crept. “And oft—his only visitor—I sought The hermit of the desert; for I thought That He, who died for all, might yet impart The grace that passeth utterance to his heart; And alteration in his eye to me Seem'd heaven-sent hope, and growing piety. But weak and weaker hourly he became; More frequent tremors shook his faded frame; A deadly hectic flush'd his fallen cheek; His voice was changed to treble, small and weak; Pain in his eye subdued th' expression wild— The Misanthrope was gentle as a child; And he complain'd that oft the light was green, That blue sparks girt his bed, in darkness seen, And that the rushes on the floor had wings, And moved, and flew, like animated things. Then would he mourn his nights unbless'd with sleep, And bend his face upon my knee and weep, And say that he had wished in vain to die; And that (although he shrunk when death seem'd nigh) Oft had he gazed upon the heaving main, And long'd to leap, and turn'd, and look'd again. But if I pray'd him to return with me, Then, like a wretch who strives with agony, And deeply maim'd, prepares his final blow, He muster'd up his strength, and answer'd ‘No!’ Once, only once, his anguish sank in pray'r, And utter'd all a broken heart's despair:— ‘In doubt I lived, in horror I expire; Release me, O release me! in thine ire; Or in thy mercy, Father, set me free! For my eyes hate the blessèd sun to see, That only bids my hopeless spirit mourn O'er ill-spent hours that never can return.’ “When last I sought his hermit-home, no smoke Rose o'er the hemlock huge, or greener oak. My heart misgave me as my steps drew near, And chill I enter'd with foreboding fear. No voice replied to mine; the dog had fled! The house was tenantless, the fire was dead. Night came in storms; and I, perforce, must stay, And wait in loneliness the coming day. O'erwearied, soon I slept; but thunders deep Roused me, appall'd, from unrefreshing sleep, And the still horror of portentous dreams. Night seem'd eternal; and the morning beams, As if averse to chase so foul a night, Prolong'd their slumber in the hall of light. But when the grey-eyed morning sweetly spread Her dappled mantle o'er the mountain's head, I issued from my prison-house of dread. “The sun had not yet risen. The forest threw Gigantic darkness on the mingled hue Of gold and crimson in the brightening sky; The sea was fiery purple to the eye; And o'er the waves, still warring with the gale, The moon was shining calm, and cold, and pale. Frown'd sea and strand, but heaven divinely smiled; And, cheer'd, I sought the hermit in the wild. I reach'd his wonted station on the shore; I found him there; and to the billow's roar He seem'd to listen from his bed of sand, His face to heaven, his head upon his hand. I paused—and felt at heart a deadly chill: Did ever breathing bosom lie so still? Wan as the ocean's foam, with unclosed eye, As if to take his farewell of the sky, Serene he lay in everlasting rest, The faithful terrier pining on his breast. “Scarce hath the lily faded on her shroud, Since earth's cold curtain, like a friendly cloud, Closed o'er our sinful sister! and the tear Of dread and woe is damp upon her bier. She did but go before him: he is here! “Yes, fallen and hapless maiden! he is come Who sent thy nameless baby to the tomb, And led thee forth from Paradise to weep: In silence by thy side his dust shall sleep. Poor sufferer! is the day of trouble past? And have ye reach'd a sheltering port at last? Ye pair whom death hath wedded! may ye rise From that cold bed, redeem'd, beyond the skies To bless Eternal Mercy, when the powers Of sin are vanquish'd! But to us and ours, Long shall your union be a mournful page, In admonition rich: and youth and age (Not taught like you) shall read with streaming eye Your letter'd stone, and ponder solemnly. Youth! would'st thou end in woe? in guilt begin; ‘The curse of God is in the house of sin.’ Look here, unholy Love! thy victims these: Behold thy triumphs! thou, whose lip can freeze The warmest bosom, blast the fairest face! Thou who canst wed affection to disgrace, Turn beauty's locks to horror with thy breath, And round youth's temples bind the coronal of death!” The earth fell heavy on the coffin'd clay That, deep interr'd, awaits the Judgment Day. A sudden whirlwind shook the gospel-oak; White in the bay the booming billow broke; And there was tumult in the lurid sky, Red battle in the clouds; and terror's eye Saw forms of dread through heaven's broad desert roam; Close press'd the awe-struck crowd, and hurried home. Even Kirk himself, who scorn'd the utter'd word, A cold freethinker, simpering while he heard, Felt his heart awed with new reflection now, And thoughts unwelcome sadden'd on his brow. O'er the cold dead broods silence, hush'd and deep, And Henley slumbers where his victims sleep. SPIRITS AND MEN. AN EPIC POEM. To James Montgomery, Esq., author of “The World Before the Flood,” I dedicate in this fragment an evidence of my presumption and my despair. BOOK I. I sing of men and angels, and the days When God repented Him that He had made Man on the earth; when crimes alone won praise; When the few righteous were with curses paid, And none seem'd vile as they whom truth betray'd; Till hope despair'd her myriad sons to save, And giant sin fill'd up their universal grave. But these—are these the flowers of Paradise, That bloom'd when man before his Maker stood Off'ring his sinless thoughts in sacrifice?— Flowers, ye remind me of rock, vale, and wood, Haunts of my early days, and still loved well: Bloom not your sisters fair in Locksley's dell? And where the sun, o'er purple moorlands wide, Gilds Wharncliffe's oaks, while Don is dark below? And where the blackbird sings on Rother's side? And where Time spares the age of Conisbro'?— Sweet flowers, remember'd well! your hues, your breath, Call up the dead to combat still with death: The spirits of my buried years arise! Again a child, where childhood roved I run; While groups of speedwell, with their bright blue eyes, Like happy children, cluster in the sun. Still the wan primrose hath a golden core; The millefoil, thousand-leaf'd, as heretofore, Displays a little world of flow'rets grey; And tiny maids might hither come to cull The woe-mark'd cowslip of the dewy May; And still the fragrant thorn is beautiful. I do not dream! Is it, indeed, a rose That yonder in the deep'ning sunset glows? Methinks the orchis of the fountain'd wold Hath, in its well-known beauty, something new. Do I not know thy lofty disk of gold, Thou, that still woo'st the sun, with passion true? No, splendid stranger! haply, I have seen One not unlike thee, but with humbler mien, Watching her lord. O lily, fair as aught Beneath the sky! thy pallid petals glow In evening's blush; but evening borrows nought Of thee, thou rival of the stainless snow— For thou art scentless. Lo! this finger'd flower, That round the cottage window weaves a bower, Is not the woodbine; but that lowlier one, With thick green leaves, and spike of dusky fire, Enamour'd of the thatch it grows upon, Might be the house leek of rude Hallamshire, And would awake, beyond divorcing seas, Thoughts of green England's peaceful cottages. Yes, and this blue-eyed child of earth, that bends Its head on leaves with liquid diamonds set, A heavenly fragrance in its sighing sends; And though 'tis not our downcast violet, Yet might it, haply, to the zephyr tell That 'tis beloved by village maids as well. Thou little, dusky, crimson-bosom'd bird, Starting, but not in fear, from tree to tree! I never erst thy plaintive love-notes heard, Nor hast thou been a suppliant erst to me For table crumbs, when winds bow'd branch and stem, And leafless twigs form'd winter's diadem:— No, thou art not the bird that haunts the grange, Storm-pinch'd, with bright black eyes and breast of flame. I look on things familiar, and yet strange, Known, and yet new, most like, yet not the same; I hear a voice, ne'er heard before, repeat Songs of the past. But Nature's voice is sweet, Wherever heard; her works, wherever seen, Are might and beauty to the mind and eye; To the lone heart, though oceans roll between, She speaks of things that but with life can die; And while, above the thundering Gihon's foam, That cottage smokes, my heart seems still at home, In England still—though there no mighty flood Sweeps, like a foaming earthquake, from the clouds; But still in England, where rock-shading wood Shelters the peasant's home, remote from crowds, And shelter'd once as noble hearts as e'er Dwelt in th' Almighty's form, and knew nor guilt, nor fear. How like an eagle, from his mile-high rock, Down sweeps the Gihon, smitten into mist On groaning crags, that, thunder-stunn'd, resist The headlong thunder, and eternal shock, Where, far below, like ages with their deeds, The wat'ry anarchy doth foam and sweep! Now wing'd with light, which wingèd gloom succeeds; Now beautiful as hope, or wild and deep As fate's last mystery; now swift and bright As human joy, then black as horror's night! And high above the torrent, yet how near, The cottage of the woodman, Thamar, stands, Gazing afar, where Enoch's towers appear, And distant hills, that look on farther lands. Beautiful cottage! breathe thy air of balm, Safe as a sleeping cloud, when heaven is calm! Smile, like an exiled patriot, on the bed Of death, with not a friend to close his eyes!— Smile in the brightness of the sunset red, On all that pride strives vainly to despise! Beautiful cottage! with an earnest tear, My soul hath sworn grief never enter'd here. Have I then found on earth the long-sought heav'n, Where man's associate, Sorrow, never came? Where humbled sin ne'er wept to be forgiven, And falsehood's cheek ne'er blush'd with truth and shame? Alas! lone cottage of the mountain's brow! All that wan grief can teach thine inmates know. I look upon the world before the flood That vainly swept a sinful race away:— Vainly, if tyrants still disport in blood; If they who toil are still the spoiler's prey; If war, waste, want, rebellion, now, as then, Rave over nations, grown in folly grey; And earth, beneath the feet of hopeless men, Still groaning, cries, “Redemption cometh!”—When? O World before the Flood! thou answer'st not, Though, still importunate, I question thee! Shall I, then, paint thee, as thou seem'st afar, Seen through the mist of years, a moral blot, Too like the world that is, and long may be? Spirits and men! Spirits that were and are! Though worlds grow old in darkness, I will write The drama of your deeds, with none to aid, And none to praise my song; not ill repaid E'en by the pleasing labour of my choice; And, haply, not in vain I lift my voice, Intent to teach the future by the past, If truth, like death, long shunn'd, is met at last. Yes, lonely cottage of the mountain's brow! All that wan grief can teach thine inmates know, For on thy humble pallet Thamar sleeps, And Zillah dares not hope he yet will wake; Pale, with her children, by his side she weeps. Yet, yet he shall revive, and speak, and take A last farewell of her, so true and dear, Who watches him in hope—ah, no! in fear!— The victim of a dungeon's heavy breath, And the rack's torture; doom'd in youth to death, Because he dared, with millions tame too long, To murmur at misrule too long endured; Six years chain'd down in Enoch's dungeons strong; Released by seeming mercy, yet secured By cunning vengeance, while it but set free The thrall which death had mark'd for liberty. Unconscious of all strife, he struggles now; But Zillah feels the pang that knits his brow. Oh, how intensely still she bends above The sire of children not yet fatherless! Did not his lip, his bosom, feebly move? Did he not faintly sigh? O happiness! He breathes—for her he looks (but long in vain) Who would not quit for worlds that scene of pain; And she bends o'er him speechless. How he tries To utter her dear name! Strong spasms control His tongue; but while the half-form'd accent dies, His eyes meet hers, and soul is mix'd with soul; A thousand thoughts, the feelings of long years, Are mingled in wild joy that hath no words, no tears! Words came, at length, and tears were wildly shed. “I die at home, and thou art here,” he said; “But though released, I die at home, and feel Thy warm tears, Zillah, on my bosom cold; Think not that aught but fire can soften steel, Or that, in pity, wolves relax their hold. Oh, I have dream'd of volleyed seas, and fire, Sad retribution, haply, yet to be! The tyrant's power and will obey a higher; And vain is human strife with destiny. Know, from thy womb the destined twain have sprung, On whom the fate of this doom'd world is hung. O may their deeds, magnanimous and just, Cancel the crimes of ages, and retrieve The fainting hopes of man, when I am dust!— For I must leave thee, Eva! I must leave Thee, my brave boy! your sire is summon'd hence To join Mahali, whom his innocence Could not defend or rescue; if, indeed, My ill-starr'd father lives not yet fast bound In torturing dungeons, whose slow pangs exceed All other pangs. But, ah! what mists surround My swimming brain! what means this sudden gloom? Take not my children from me ere I die! I cannot see your faces. Nearer come, Irad, yet nearer. Eva, art thou nigh? Zillah, thy hand—my poor, ill-fated one! I see a shade, resembling thee—'tis gone!” He ended, and with closing eyes, that seemed Unwillingly to veil their orbs, bereaved Of that fair form, on which their last glance beam'd, Sank into gentlest slumber, unperceived. But still she listen'd, still gazed on the clay That, mocking life, yet mute as marble lay; And watch'd his darkening paleness in despair. He died in manhood's prime, nor had slow pain Marr'd all his manly beauty; no grey hair Reproach'd his auburn locks. Could she refrain From cruel hope? Ah, yes: she stooping stood, And felt in all its woe her widowhood. She ask'd no wings, to bear her soul above, Although her dream of earthly bliss was o'er; But on the lips, that smiled in lifeless love, She press'd a lip, which thenceforth smiled no more. She stood like Sorrow watching on a tomb. The beauteous woe, that charm'd like shaded light, The cheek, yet young, that knew no youthful bloom, Well suited her dark brow and forehead white; And in the sad endurance of her eye Was all that love believes of woman's majesty. Could such a pair as this be born to bring Creatures of toil into a world of woe?— From such a stock undying patriots spring, As Enoch's rebel-lord too soon may know; For long misrule prepares the dreadful way Of him who brings to Baalath dismay. While at her mother's side pale Eva bends, And mourns her sire, with soul-appalling cries, Even now, the son of lifeless Thamar sends Half-utter'd threats of vengeance with his sighs. He longs to snatch the jav'lin from the wall; In age a boy, in soul a man, and tall Beyond his years, his weeping eyes flash fire: He feels within what power assails in vain; His sobs repeat the last words of his sire; He sees but Thamar's wrongs, Mahali's chain! Man of the future! thou wilt do or die, And deathless is thy wish, “Revenge and liberty!” Midnight was past. The children of the dead Slept:—but the widow kiss'd his stiff'ning form, Laid out his limbs, and wept; then o'er him threw Her snowy bridal robe, and, like a worm, Sank on his breast, convolved, but not in pain. Lo! when she waked to thought and grief again, A beauteous blue-eyed youth before her stood, With golden ringlets, and an angel's grace, And all the sweetness of the fair and good, And more than mortal sorrow in his face! On his young cheek th' unfaded rose was white, And from his sodden hair the rain of night Dripp'd. “Give me shelter till the morn,” he cried, “I'm tired and cold.” Zillah. Whence com'st thou, pallid one? Timna. From Eden's forest, where the spectres glide. Zil. Where is thy home? Tim. In heaven! or I have none. Zil. Where are thy parents? Tim. Here no love-taught bird Is motherless like me. But thou hast heard My Father whisper! and it shakes th' abode Of the archangels. Zil. Tell me, hast thou, then, No friends? Tim. Yes, many friends; the great, good God, The sinless spirits, and all righteous men. Zil. Where dwell'st thou? Tim. Everywhere. By summer floods I sleep. I am the guest of all the woods, And dine in caves that give the viper birth; The clouds look on me from the hurried sky, (They know their homeless brother of the earth;) And all the winds accost me as they fly, Still wandering with me through the desert, glad. Zil. Who art thou? Tim. I am Timna, call'd the sad, Because fond mothers still are doom'd to see Their most unhappy sons resemble me;— Timna, at whose approach dull spirits flee; Who sits beneath the roof of amethyst, And treads the spacious, mountain-broider'd floor: From courts and palaces, with scorn dismiss'd, Nor always welcomed by the friendless poor; But all the children of the forest know The leveret's playmate, the lark's bed-fellow. Instinctively the wond'ring widow took The fragment of a loaf, her precious hoard, Down from its shelf, and pausing, with a look Of thoughtful sadness, laid it on the board. “Nay,” said the youth, “I want not food, but rest!” Then bounded into bed, and slept on Irad's breast. But Zillah slept not. Till the morning broke, She watch'd, in desolation and despair, Senseless to all but woe. The guardian oak Moan'd o'er the roof it shelter'd; the thick air Labour'd with doleful sounds; the night-bird shriek'd Thrice; the expiring embers harshly creak'd; And with strange boom mourn'd Gihon's bordering wood, Heard faintly; while upon the hearth-stone grey, The cricket of the world before the flood Bounded unseen. But when the infant day (While the low casement's leaves and flowers all shook In the fresh breeze) darted a bright'ning look On the poor cottage, and, with rosy beam, Lit up into a smile the features pale Of the stiff corse, she started, with a scream, Like one who feels the earth beneath him fail; For, like a sweet but gather'd flower, life seem'd To linger yet with silence and decay. But on dark orbs the golden morning beam'd; And on the dead the lifeless blush still lay So fair, so life-like, that despair was fain— No, not to hope, but yet to weep again. She wept, she look'd—and, lo! her children rose Companionless! “Where is the pensive one, Who, on my Irad's breast, in sweet repose, Lay like a flower?” The stranger youth was gone! Zillah, in fear and wonder, gazed around; But Timna, the lost wanderer, was not found. “Then hath a vision, beautiful as truth, Deceived thee, Zillah, in the shadowy night? Was it a dream? and did no angel youth, Shake from his dripping hair the liquid light, And utter unimaginable things? Came he, indeed, like a strange bird, whose wings Blaze with unearthly hues, that on the mind Cast a bewildering glare? Or doth mine eye See forms, to which untroubled hearts are blind?” Perplex'd, and wonder-stricken, silently She ponder'd thus; while, through the open door Swift Irad ran t'wards Gihon's wooded shore, Not without purpose; for, amid the trees, As from the heights his rapid way he bent, His bright curls trembling backward from the breeze, He saw the wondrous youth, and, wond'ring, went To meet him. Hand in hand, along the lawn, Lovely alike, they came. A lifeless fawn Upon the board the graceful stranger threw; Laid on the floor his quiver and his bow; Dash'd from his bare and snowy feet the dew; Stroked back the golden ringlets from his brow; And look'd like morn, “with eyes of azure light.” “Know ye,” he said, “the wanderer of the night? Lo! He who feeds the wren, hath sent ye food! Behold the hunter, who, in darkness finds Paths only trod by spirits of the wood, And knows the secrets of the waves and winds! Me—as the seraphim and cherubim, Who serve whom they adore, have need of him, As I of Him who sent me—ye will need. Strength is vouchsafed thee, mother! strength, to cope With earth and hell; and He, from whom proceed All perfect gifts, bids thee endure in hope. O my sweet Irad! I will show thee all The wonders of the forest walks; and we Will hear the sky-invading mountains call On God, in thunder. Wilt thou hunt with me? Oft will we chase the deer o'er dazzling snow Above the clouds; and thou shalt bear my bow. Last night, methought that I was borne, with thee, Beyond the gorgeous rainbow, through the cold, Blue air, star-high, above a cloudy sea; When, lo! bright waves of glass, with foreheads bold, Like towers of light, in majesty arose, Or like earth's mountains, but more vast than those: Now, mute as mountains in their hoods of snow; Now, like ten thousand Gihons, crush'd and riven And shatter'd into darkness by one blow Of deafening fire, from end to end of heav'n. O do not thou despise the dreams of sleep! Dreams come from God, and oft have meanings deep. But know'st thou, boy, that I interpret dreams? I will interpret mine, when tired we lie On some bare rock, amid the cloudless beams Of the lone sun, while, midway in the sky, Forms, such as live in heaven-sent visions bright, Are dash'd, at once, from glory into night. But righteous deeds can wash out crimes; and ye, The last of Abel's race, are arm'd with power To wing with gloom or light the destined hour; To call down vengeance from the starless sky, Or quench in joy the wide world's misery.” Inspired or mad the fervid wanderer wrought Faith in his hearers. Zillah wept aloud, In joy and grief, and marvell'd, when she thought Of Thamar's dying words. Humbly she bow'd Her head in silent prayer; while Timna's face Was clasp'd to Irad's heart, in friendship's first embrace. No friendly neighbour, in his sad attire, Came to see Thamar in his last home laid: Who soothed the children? Who bewail'd the sire?— All shunn'd the house proscribed. But Eber made, Beneath the loftiest tree that crown'd the steep, His brother's narrow bed of lasting sleep, And hallow'd it with curses: low and dread, He mutter'd threats of vengeance o'er the dead. No solemn priest the ritual grand intoned; No mournful bell toll'd for the doom of all; But o'er his lifeless form Affection moan'd, And kings might envy Thamar's funeral: Borne to the grave by all he loved in life, Around him wept, son, daughter, brother, wife! And Timna raised the sweetest voice that e'er Was heard beneath the azure canopy:— “Rest, woe-worn man, that knew'st nor crime, nor fear! Sweet after toil is rest. Thou now art free, Enfranchised slave! Full well thy task is done; Although the fateful work is but begun!” Then all was silent, save the deep-drawn sigh And bursting sob. But soon strange sounds were heard That roused the echoes; and, approaching nigh, The sun-bright car of Baalath appear'd, Drawn by six out-stretch'd steeds, that scorn'd the rein, O'er which the affrighted driver shriek'd in vain. Groaning, with shaken forelock, each swift horse Shot from his eyes the shiver'd light abroad, Couch'd close his ears, and in his sightless course, Beat up the thunder from the granite road: Wild as the foam of Gihon, backward stream'd The toss of frighted manes: the pale slaves scream'd In terror for their lord. All stooping low— With bloody whip and spur—all follow'd fast; And power-adoring Jared, hopeless now, Pursued the fluctuating car, aghast, Yet resolute with Baalath to die. The king alone, though not to danger blind, Sate unappall'd in kingly dignity; He only worthy seem'd to rule mankind. Like brandish'd torches, steeds and chariot flash'd, Like rushing flames, along the rugged path; And, lo! th' unsleeping height, whence Gihon dash'd From rock to rock, a giant in his wrath! Still onward, onward steeds and chariot blazed; The mourners started from their woe and gazed! But at that moment, from the depth sublime, A man arose, grey-hair'd, of thoughtful mien; Grey-hair'd, and yet no pencil-mark of time On his fresh cheek, or lofty brow, was seen: He, rising, like the spirit of the flood, Said to the frantic steeds, “Stand!” and they stood. Jared again breathed freely; and all eyes Look'd on the stranger. There was in his face Terrible beauty. Something of the skies Seem'd mix'd up with his clay; a heavenly grace Awed in his action. Young, to every eye, Yet old he seem'd; as if eternity Had felt the weight of years; or gloom and light, Deathless and coincarnate, moved and spoke; A human presence, with a spirit's might, That was ere death was—yea, ere morning broke On lands where life was not, save life that fear'd Nor shroud, nor worm. As when heaven's fire hath sear'd The early verdure of a giant wood, Throned on the mountains; still the living shade Renews its pride, though smitten: so he stood— Like placid Jove, in marble undecay'd, Gazing on time, with death-defying eye, And throning on his brow divinity. The king descended from the arrested car; The monarch was forgotten in the man; And, as a friend with friend familiar, Swift to embrace that form divine, he ran, And shook his calm preserver by the hand; Then, turning coldly, he resumed the king, And, pausing, spoke:—“But if an angel's wing Had swept us from the abyss, and on the land Placed us in safety, still we could have said But this—that, everywhere, the royal head Hath heavenly guardians. Man, what is thy name?” Joel. My name is Joel. Baalath. Well, so let it be. But not, perchance, the exile!—No? Joel. The same. Baalath. No more an exile, then—I pardon thee. Now, ask a boon, and on my royal word, It shall be thine. Joel. Let Enoch's flatter'd lord, For once, hear truth. This is the boon I crave. Baalath. Who yet e'er lied to Baalath, and wore His head a fortnight? The presumptuous slave! Well, let us hear, what kings ne'er heard before, That slaves are grateful. When?—e'en when thou wilt. He smiled, and yet his right hand sought the hilt Of his keen sword. Smiling, he turn'd away, To hide the rage that shook his inmost soul; And, while the mourners linger'd yet, to pay The debt of love and grief, with troubled scowl Approach'd them, follow'd by his guards. He stood Beside the grave; he trembled, and the blood Rush'd to his heart. “Widow! I come too late, And yet I came to pardon and to save; But all men, kings themselves, must bow to fate. I cannot call thy husband from the grave; But I would dry thy tears. Behold in me Thy king and friend: nor destitute is she On whom the royal condescension turns An eye of favour. With a doubting frown, Thy son beholds me. In his bosom burns The spirit that I like. Though born a clown, Yet if a clown he die, be his the blame. I will advance him to the height of fame, Honour, and wealth; and Eva shall repair To Enoch's marble halls. She was not born To waste her sweetness on the desert air.” Zillah looked up; but sorrow conquer'd scorn. She tried to speak; but her lip, quivering, fell. Then in sweet tones, but deep and terrible, Timna, like truth denouncing guilt, address'd Th' astonish'd son of Hamath the severe. “Thou bane and terror of a land oppress'd! King by thy sire's successful treason, hear! Too soon, dost thou forget what causes laid Methuliel at a subject's feet, betray'd! That evil comes of evil, multiplied Still by its increase, till endurance fling His burden at the feet of tyrant pride, And vengeance, hallow'd by long suffering, Arraying havock under all the sky, Woe's dreadful cure is its enormity! Pleased with thy people's bane, thy law of force, Thou gazest smiling on a realm undone, And know'st not that thou gazest on a corse, Whose features swell and redden in the sun, While the worms' motion, in their hungry strife, Makes an abhorr'd caricature of life. See where, unseen, their loathsome feast they share! See!—why wilt thou not see that death is there? But, last of Cain's blind race, thou worse than blind, Hark! there are whispers in the boding wind! Thy victims bid me speak their murderer's doom. Truth, told to thee, shall be to thee a lie, And falsehood truth. Friendship and love shall bloom Like venomous flowers to thee: thy jaundiced eye, Hating their innocence, shall gloat on weeds; For cherish'd foes shall rule thee and thy deeds; And thou on Danger's lap thy rest shall take, Till, thunder-stunn'd, thou wake aghast, to gaze On lightnings that the earth's deep centre shake; Then rush, for very dread, into the blaze— Dead, with a single shriek! while all who hear That one wild yell die also—kill'd by fear.” He spoke; and Eva swoon'd on Timna's breast, And Baalath turn'd black with jealous ire; Avenging furies tore his heart unbless'd, And sear'd his frantic veins with poison'd fire. Mute stood the guards; on them a new light broke, And slumb'ring mischief in their souls awoke, While Jared from the scabbard flash'd his sword, And Timna smiled, like faith, to die prepared; But Baalath's commanding nod restored To Jared's thigh the weapon rashly bared. “Woe's words,” he said, “like swords, are blind and sharp: We ask not music from a broken harp. Our visit is ill-timed.” He spoke, and turn'd, And climb'd his chariot, while his humbled pride Felt that a despot in his vitals burn'd Who fear'd not kings. Then down the mountain's side, And through the glens, with flowers and verdure gay, T'wards Enoch's thousand towers he wound his way. Beyond the valleys, and their hermit streams, Far on the mountain-girded plain they shone, Above the smoky ocean, which the beams Of evening painted. Gihon flow'd alone, Unseen, beneath the hated curtain deep, Where deeds were done “that made the angels weep.” While they beheld, in heav'nly sadness bow'd, That wilderness of homes, that desert of the crowd. THE VILLAGE PATRIARCH. To Henry Brougham, Esq., the Friend of the Poor, and the Champion of Education, as a humble Tribute of Respect and Gratitude for his efforts in the great cause of Humanity, this tale of Enoch Wray (the incarnation of a century) is dedicated by the Author. EXORDIUM. Monopoly! if every funeral bough Of thine be hung with crimes too foul to name; Accursed of millions! if already thou, Watch'd by mute vengeance and indignant shame, Art putting forth thy buds of blood and flame, What will thy fruitage be? No matter—wave Thy branches o'er our hearts! and, like a pall, Let thy broad shadow darken Freedom's grave! Not yet the Upas of the Isles shall fall, If ought shall stand. Spread, then, and cover all! Fear'st thou the axe? Long since the feller died; And thou art deaf to thunder. But, Black Tree! Thine own fruits will consume thee in thy pride! O may thy inbred flame blast nought but thee, When burns the beacon which the blind shall see! Meantime, I make my theme the toil and grief That water thee with tears—the fear and hate Whose mutter'd curses fan thy deadly leaf— Sad, silent changes—burning wrongs, that wait To hear Delusion scream at Rapine's gate, “Our master's cause is lost, and Hell's undone!” BOOK I. CONTENTS. Continued Frost—Enoch Wray leaves his Cottage on a Visit to the Neighbouring Town—His Blindness and Poverty—His Familiarity with the old Roads of the Country—His Perplexity in the Town—Changes there—Rural Names of some of the Streets— Country-born Widow and Her Attempts at a Garden—Her Consumptive Boy, and His Flowers—Female Artisans Singing Hymns at their Labour—Meeting of Enoch Wray and his old Blind Servant. I. Through fiery haze broad glares the angry sun; The travell'd road returns an iron sound; Rings in the frosty air the murderous gun; The fieldfare dies; and heavy to the ground, Shot in weak flight, the partridge falls—his wound Purpling with scatter'd drops the crusted snow. Loud thumps the forge; bright burns the cottage fire, From which the tilter's lad is loth to go; Well pleased the tramper sees the smoke aspire; High flies the swan; each wild strange bird is shyer, And, terror-taught, suspects hill, vale, and plain. II. Our poor blind father grasps his staff again— O Heav'n! protect him on his way alone! Of things familiar to him, what remain? The very road is changed; his friend, the stone On which he wont to sit and rest, is gone; And ill the agèd blind can spare a friend! III. How lone is he, who, blind and near his end, Seeks old acquaintance in a stone or tree! All feeling and no sight! O let him spend The gloaming hour in chat with memory! Nor start from dreams to curse reality, And friends more hard and cold than trees and stones! IV. He takes the townward road, and inly groans At men, whose looks he does not see, but feel; Men whose harsh steps have language! cruel tones That strike his ear and heart, as if with steel! There dwelt they, ere Corruption's brazen seal Stamp'd power's hard image on such dross as theirs? V. Thou meanest thing that Heav'n endures and spares! Thou upstart dandy, with the cheek of lead! How dar'st thou from the wall push those grey hairs? Dwarf! if he lift a finger, thou art dead: His thumb could fillip off thy worthless head— His foot, uplifted, spurn thee o'er the moon! VI. “Some natural tears he drops, but wipes them soon;” And thinks how changed his country and his kind, Since he, in England's and in manhood's noon, Toil'd lightly and earn'd much; or, like the wind, Went forth o'er flowers, with not a care behind, And knew nor grief, nor want, nor doubt, nor fear. VII. Beadle! how canst thou smite, with speech severe, One who was reverenced long ere thou wast born? No homeless, soulless beggar meets thee here, Although that threadbare coat is patch'd and torn: His bursting heart repels thy taunt with scorn, But deems thee human, for thy voice is man's. VIII. You, too, proud dame, whose eye so keenly scans The king's blind subject on the king's high road! You who much wonder that, with all our plans To starve the poor, they still should crawl abroad! Ye both are journeying to the same abode. But, lady, your glad eye, o'er wave, and shore, And shoreless heaven, with sightless speed may rove, And drink resplendent joy; while he no more Shall look on Nature's face: Rock, river, grove, Hate's withering frown, the heart-sent blush of love, Noon, midnight, morning, all are dark to him! IX. Thou, skater! motion-poised, may'st proudly swim In air-borne circles o'er the glassy plain, While beauty lauds thy graceful sweep of limb; But to the blind, alas! her praise is pain: It but recalls his boyish days in vain, When he too, seen and praised, could see and praise. To him there is no beauty but the heart's, No light but that within; the solar blaze For him no colour to the rose imparts; The rainbow is a blank; and terror starts No ghost in darkness thicker than his own. X. Yet sweet to him, ye stream-loved valleys lone, Leafless, or blossoming fragrant, sweet are ye! For he can hear the wintry forest groan, And feel the grandeur which he cannot see, And drink the breath of Nature, blowing free. Sweet still it is through fields and woods to stray; And fearless wanders he the country wide, For well old Enoch knows each ancient way; He finds in every moss-grown tree a guide— To every time-dark rock he seems allied: Calls the stream “sister!” and is not disown'd. XI. Usurper of the hills! hast thou dethroned The regal oak? He bows his honours hoar, Too conscious of his fall, in vain bemoan'd; He yields to thee, storm-loving sycamore! And on the inland peak, or sea-beat shore, Thou reign'st alike. But thee, though yonder hill Stoops to thy height, our father planted here; And still he loves thy palmy shade, and still, E'en when the snow-flake plumes thy branches sere, He climbs the age-worn road that lingers near, And seems, though blind, on distant hills to gaze. XII. But much he dreads the town's distracting maze, Where all, to him, is full of change and pain. New streets invade the country; and he strays, Lost in strange paths, still seeking, and in vain, For ancient landmarks, or the lonely lane Where oft he play'd at Crusoe, when a boy. Fire vomits darkness, where his lime-trees grew; Harsh grates the saw, where coo'd the wood-dove coy; Tomb crowds on tomb, where violets droop'd in dew; And, brighter than bright heaven, the speedwell blue Cluster'd the bank, where now the town-bred boor (Victim and wretch, whose children never smile,) Insults the stranger, sightless, old, and poor, On swill'd Saint Monday, with his cronies vile, Drunk for the glory of the holy isle, While pines his wife, and tells to none her woes! XIII. Here, Enoch, flaunts no more the wild brier rose, Nor basks the lizard here, or harmless snake. No more the broom, in spring, all golden glows O'er the clear rill, that, whimpering through the brake, Heard thy blythe youth the echoing vale awake. All that was lovely then is gloomy now. Then, no strange paths perplex'd thee—no new streets, Where draymen bawl, while rogues kick up a row; And fishwives grin, while fopling fopling meets; And milk-lad his rebellious donkey beats; While dwarfish cripple shuffles to the wall; And hopeless tradesman sneaks to alehouse mean; And imps of beggary curse their dad, and squall For mammy's gin; and matron, poor and clean, With tearful eye, begs crust for lodger lean; And famish'd weaver, with his children three, Sings hymns for bread; and legless soldier, borne In dog-drawn car, imploreth charity; And thief with steak from butcher runs forlorn; And debtor bows, while banker smiles in scorn; And landed pauper, in his coach and four, Bound to far countries from a realm betray'd, Scowls on the crowd, who curse the scoundrel's power, While coachee grins, and lofty lady's maid Turns up her nose at bread-tax-paying trade, Though master bilketh dun, and is in haste. XIV. Changed scenes, once rural—changed, and not defaced! Far other woes were yours in time of old, When Locksley o'er the hills of Hallam chased The wide-horn'd stag, or with his bowmen bold Waged war on kinglings. Vassal robbers prowl'd, And, tiger-like, skulk'd robber lords for prey, Where now groan wheelworn streets, and labour bends O'er thousand anvils. Bled the feudal fray, Or raved the foray, where the cloud ascends For ever; and from earth's remotest ends Her merchants meet, where hamlets shriek'd in flames. XV. Scenes, rural once! ye still retain sweet names, That tell of blossoms and the wandering bee: In black Pea-Croft no lark its lone nest frames; Balm-Green, the thrush hath ceased to visit thee! When shall Bower-Spring her annual corncrake see, Or start the woodcock, if the storm be near? XVI. But, mourning better days, the widow here Still tries to make her little garden bloom— For she was country-born. No weeds appear, Where her poor pinks deplore their prison-tomb; To them, alas! no second spring shall come! And there, in May, the lilac gasps for breath; And mint and thyme seem fain their woes to speak, Like saddest portraits, painted after death; And spindling wallflowers, in the choking reek, For life, for life uplift their branches weak. Pale, dwindled lad, that on her slated shop Sett'st moss and groundsel from the frosty lea! O'er them no more the tiny wren shall hop. Poor plants!—poor child! I pity them and thee! Yet blame I not wise Mercy's high decree. They fade—thou diest; but thou to live again— To bloom in heav'n. And will thy flowers be there? Heav'n without them, would smile for thee in vain. Thither, poor boy, the primrose shall repair, There violets breathe of England's dewy air, And daisies speak of her, that dearest one, Who then shall bend above thy early bier, Mourning her feeble boy for ever gone, Yet long to clasp his dust for ever here! No, no, it shall not want or flower or tear! In thy worn hand her sorrow will not fail To place the winter rose, or wind-flower meek; Then kiss thy marble smile, thy forehead pale, But not the icy darkness from thy cheek; Then gaze—then press her heart that yet shall break; And feebly sob—“My child, we part to meet!” XVII. Hark! music still is here! How wildly sweet, Like flute-notes in a storm, the psalm ascends From yonder pile, in traffic's dirtiest street! There hapless woman at her labour bends, While with the rattling fly her shrill voice blends; And ever, as she cuts the headless nail, She sings—“I waited long, and sought the Lord, And patiently did bear.” A deeper wail Of sister voices joins, in sad accord— “He set my feet upon his rock adored!” And then, perchance—“O God, on man look down!” XVIII. And Enoch seeks, with pensive joy, the town; For there his brother in misfortune dwells, The old and sightless sawyer, once his own. They meet—with pride and grief his bosom swells; And how they once could see, each sadly tells. But Charles is changed; and Enoch's bosom bleeds To mark the change. Though aged but eighty years, Bedrid and blind, the sorrowing sawyer needs All friendly aid. Crack'd, on the wall, appears His famous violin. No rival fears His trembling hand, which never more shall call The young, the gay, the manly, and the fair, To penny hop or rustic festival! No fading prude again shall curl her hair, Nor fop new whiskers buy, nor age repair To hear him charm the loveliest of the land. The tear is trembling in our father's eye; Kindly he takes his ancient servant's hand, Stoops to his whisper, to his feeble sigh Sighs; and, with hands uplifted reverently, And heav'nward eyes, upon his bended knees, Implores the Father of the poor to spare His pious friend, and cure his long disease; Or give him strength his painful load to bear, That, dying, he may show “what good men are:” For Thou disdain'st not pray'r from lowly walls. The squalid hovel, where the poor and just Kneel, is, in thy sight, splendid as the halls Where pray the proud — with contrite hearts, I trust— Then highest when they know they are but dust. O God! continue to thy grateful son The grace which thou hast never yet denied To humble faith, that bids thy will be done! And let it still, in meekness, be his pride To praise thy name, and hear it glorified! Poor is thy son, and blind, and scorn'd, like me; Yet thee we bless, that he can proudly say He eats the hoarded bread of industry, And that he hath not, in his evil day, Tasted the bitterness of parish-pay. Though frail thy child, like all who weep below, His life, thou know'st, has been no baneful weed; He never gather'd where he did not plough, He reap'd not where he had not scatter'd seed; And Christ, we know, for sinners deign'd to bleed! At thy tribunal want may be forgiv'n; There, to be lowly is not to be base. Oh, then—if equal, in the eye of Heav'n, Are all the children of the human race; If pomp and pride have in thy courts no place— Let humble friends, who long have sojourn'd here In love united, meet in love again, Where dust, divorced from sin, and pain, and fear, In ever-bless'd communion shall remain, With powers that know not death, nor grief, nor stain, Warbling to heav'nly airs the grateful soul! BOOK II. CONTENTS. A Fine Day in Winter—Enoch Wray seated in the Sunshine at his Cottage Door—His neglected Garden a Symptom of Poverty— The Condition of the Poor changed for the worse since the Patriarch was young—Great Events of his Time—Invasion of England by the Pretender—American War—French Revolution—Napoleon. I. Thou call'st the Village Patriarch to his door, Brief, brilliant summer of a winter's day! While the sweet redbreast, minstrel of the poor, Perch'd on the blossoming hazel, trills his lay, To cheer that blind, good man, old Enoch Wray. Behold our Father, still unbow'd by time! Eld with his gentle locks full gently plays; And pain, in reverence, spares the man sublime: How few such men grace these degenerate days! E'en Death, though fain to strike, in awe delays, As if immortal age defied his might. Lo! where the peeping primrose comes again, To see his sad, bright eyes, that roll in night, While melts the hoar-frost on the cottage pane, And dew-drops glitter in the lonely lane! Calm, as of old, with not one hoary hair Changed, thou art listening for the vernal bee; Thy fingers, like the daisy's petals fair, Spread to the sun, that loves to look on thee— Thou almost god-like in thy dignity! Hark, how the glad rill welcomes thee with pride! Ye have been friends and neighbours five-score years— Father! the stream still loiters at thy side, And still unchanged by envious time appears; Like human life, it flows, a stream of tears— But not to pass, like human life, away. II. What, though thy locks of venerable grey Claim not with yon wild cliffs coeval date, Yet, blind old man, shake hands with them, for they Are dark like thee; and, by an equal fate, They too, enduring long, shall perish late. Thou see'st not Winco, in his dusky cap, Lean'd on his elbow, as becomes his years, With all the past beneath him, like a map, O'er which he bends and ruminates in tears; But how like thee that woe-marked hill appears! Ye are not changeless, though ye long endure, And Eld herself sees but what still hath been, In him and thee. Nor art thou yet mature And ripe for death, but strong in age and green, And alter'd less than this pathetic scene. The cottage, where thy sire and his were born, Seems, as of old, a hillock in the vale: But many a chink admits the breezy morn; Neglect long since divorced the jasmine pale That clasp'd thy casement; and the sorrowing gale Sighs o'er the plot where erst thy choice flowers bloom'd. Ah! when the cottage garden runs to waste, Full oft the rank weed tells of hopes entomb'd, And points at man, once proud, now scorn'd, debased! The dogs bark at him; and he moves, disgraced, O'er wither'd joys which spring shall ne'er renew. III. Yet here, e'en yet, the florist's eye may view Sad heirs of noble sires, once dear to thee; And soon faint odours, o'er the vernal dew, Shall tempt the wanderings of the earliest bee Hither, with music sweet as poesy, To woo the flower whose verge is wiry gold. IV. But on thy brow, O ne'er may I behold Sadness!—Alas, 'tis there, and well it may! For times are changed, and friends grow scarce and cold! O let not want “his ready visit pay” To sightless age, that knew a better day! O may no parish crust thy lips profane! V. Man, poor and blind, who liv'st in worse than pain! Where'er thou art, thou helpless, wingless owl! The worm, our eyeless sister, might disdain Thee, subject to thy fellow's proud control. But what a worm is he, the blind in soul, Who makes, and hates, and tortures penury! Ah! who shall teach him mercy's law sublime? He who can sever wo and poverty, Or pride and power, or poverty and crime; He who can uninstruct the teacher, Time. Oh, yet erect, while all around are bow'd, Let Enoch Wray's majestic pride remain, A lone reproach, to sting the meanly proud, And show their victims—not, perhaps, in vain— What Britons have been, and may be again. O Age and Blindness, why should you be pair'd? O sisters three, worst fates, Want, Blindness, Age! Hope look'd from heav'n, beheld you, and despaired? But now she rends her hair, in grief and rage; Her words are prophecy, her dreams presage Evil to serf and lord; for want hath sworn Thus, to the delver of the perilous mine, And him who wakes with scrating file the morn— “By the sad worm that dies not, I am thine, And mine art thou; thy joys shall still decline Till death; thy woes increase till death—toil on!” VI. But why forestall our griefs? Dark thoughts, begone! Sufficient is its evil for the hour. The verdant leaves drop from us one by one; We need not shake them down. Life's weeping flower Droops soon enough, however slight the shower; And hope, unbidden, quits our fond embrace. VII. I will not read dejection in thy face, Nor aught save tranquil hope and gentle doom; But deem thee parent of a happy race, Thy slumbers peaceful, distant yet thy tomb; And, in thy autumn, late the rose shall bloom. Come, let us walk, as we have often walk'd, Through scenes beloved, that whisper of the past; And talk to me, as thou hast often talk'd, Of wingèd hours, too happy far to last, When toil was bliss, and thrift could gather fast Funds to sustain his long life's tranquil close; When faces wore no masks, and hearts were glad; When freedom's champions were not labour's foes; When no man deem'd the wise and honest mad; And Pope was young, and Washington a lad. Thou to the past can'st say, “Rise, live again!” For, Enoch, well rememb'rest thou the time When Britons till'd the Eden of the main, Where manly thoughts were utter'd, e'en in rhyme, And poverty was rare, and not a crime. What envied England was, long years ago, That times are alter'd, thou can'st truly tell; And, if thy thoughts are flowers that bloom in snow— If with the present and the past they dwell— Then, of the lifeless, like a passing bell, Speak to the living, ere they perish, too. If memory is to thee a precious book, Brightest where written first, and brightly true, Turning the pictured pages, bid me look On sunny meadow and rejoicing brook, And toil-brown'd labour, as the throstle gay. VIII. Thou weepest, sightless man, with tresses grey! But wherefore weep o'er ills thou can'st not cure? The darkest hour will quickly pass away, And man was born to suffer and endure. But, come what may, thy rest is near and sure; Thy bed is made, where all is well with all Who well have done. Then, Enoch, cease to mourn! Lift up thy voice, and wake the dead! Recall The deeds of other days! and from the urn Of things which were, shake words that breathe and burn. O'er the dark mantle of the night are shed Sparks of the sun, in starry spangles proud: In showery spring, when morn his radiant head Veils, the rich broom, with glittering diamonds bow'd, Is sunny light beneath the sunless cloud. Though Nature to thine eye is vainly fair, Green laugh the seasons, and the laughing light Is verdant in thy soul—the flower is there That wither'd four-score years ago, still bright, And bathed in freshness by the dewy air. And pitying spirits to thine ear repair With tales, to which unsorrowing hearts are deaf; And deeds, whose actors live not, live with thee; Still laugh and weep long buried joy and grief Which, speaking with thine eloquent tongue, shall be, When thou art gone, alive to memory. Thus to great men their country—when the bust, The urn, the arch, the column fail—remains; For ever speaks of godlike deeds the dust Which feet immortal trod; and rocks, and plains, When History's page no symbol'd thought retains, Hear dim tradition talk of deathless men. IX. Bright on the storm-swoll'n torrent of the glen Is angry sunset; bright, and warm, and strong, Are the rich visions which the poet's pen Clothes in sweet verse; but brighter is the song Of truth unwritten, from our fathers' tongue. Ah! who starts now at Balmerino's name, Which England heard pronounced in dreams, and woke? Then every mountain had a voice of flame; Blue Kinderscout to starting Snailsden spoke, And fiery speech from troubled Stanedge broke. Tell, Enoch, yet again, of that huge tree, Old as the hills; that tree to whose broad shade Your herds were driv'n, when age and infancy, The thoughful matron, and the weeping maid, Fled through the gloom where lonest Rivilin stray'd. Speak of the cellar and the friendly well In which thy mother, trembling, hid her plate; The ancient cup, whose maker none can tell; The massive tankard used on days of state; And coins long hoarded, all of sterling weight. Say how retired the robbers, disarray'd; Boast of the arms thy sire was proud to wield; Draw from its sheath, in thought, the trusty blade That drove rebellion o'er Culloden's field, Opposed in vain by Highland dirk and shield; And feel the blood-rust on its splendour keen! X. Then wing my spirit to a grander scene; Let burning thoughts and words for utterance throng; And bid me mark—though clouds will intervene To veil the waters swift, and wild, and strong— How pours the tide of human fate along. Tell of sad strife with Britain's sons, who trod Earth's virgin soil, beyond the sun-loved wave; Men—owning no superior but their God, Strong as their torrents, as their eagle, brave— Who dug with Freedom's sword Oppression's grave! Tell, too, of him, the warrior-sage, whose deeds Uncursed the future, and enfranchised man! But ah! not yet—Time's darkest hour succeeds, Unmatch'd in woe since life and death began! For Evil hath her place in Mercy's plan, And long will furnish themes for mournful rhymes. XI. Speak!—if thy soul, too full of ancient times, Will condescend of later deeds to tell— Speak of the day of blood, the night of crimes, The moral earthquake, and the earthly hell, When slaves smote tyrants served too long and well. Say how attention listen'd, pale, in heav'n, When—madden'd by Abaddon's legion brands, And too, too deeply wrong'd to be forgiv'n— They found redemption in their own right hands, Purged with retorted fire their demon'd lands, And clad in fresher green the calcined sod. XII. Nor him forget, the stripling demi-god, Before whose glance the herded nations fled. Tell how he crush'd the mountains with his nod, Walk'd on the storm, and to convulsion said, “Be still, thou babbler!” Tell how he who read The doom of kings fail'd to foresee his own. He placed upon his head the crown of steel; But dream'd he of his grave in ocean lone?— Toussaint! thy foe was doomed thy pangs to feel: On jailer-England and on him her seal Hath History set. For ocean's waste of waves Fenced not his throne from million hostile swords; Therefore he built on multitudinous graves A tyrant's power, and strove to bind with cords Thought; for she mock'd him with her wing of words That withers armies. Who shall credit thee, Genius? Still treacherous, or unfortunate, Victim, or wronger! Why must Hope still see Thy pinions, plumed with light divine, abate Their speed when nearest heav'n, to uncreate Her glorious visions? Ay, since time began, Creatures, with hearts of stone and brains of clay, Scorning thy vaunt to wing the reptile, man, O'er thee and thine have held barbarian sway; And in the night which yet may have its day, (The night of ages, moonless, starless, cold,) If the rare splendour of the might of mind Hath sometimes flash'd o'er plagues and errors old, It flash'd but to expire, and leave behind A deadlier gloom. But woodbine wreaths are twined Round thorns; and praise, to merit due, is paid To vulgar dust, best liked when earthy most. While Milton grew, self-nourish'd, in the shade, Ten Wallers bask'd in day. Misrule can boast Of many Alvas; Freedom, oft betray'd, Found her sole Washington. To shine unseen, Or only seen to blast the gazer's eye; Or struggle in eclipse, with vapours mean, That quench your brightness, and usurp the sky; Such, meteor spirits! is your destiny, Mourn'd in times past, and still deplored in these. BOOK III. CONTENTS. Comparative Independence of Skilled Labour—Fine Sabbath Morning—Sunday Stroll of the Townsman—Coach-race—Misery and Misfortunes of the Poor—Congregation leaving the Village Church—Old Mansion—Country Youth working in the Town—Poacher of the Manufacturing Districts—Concluding Reflections. I. Ere Bedford's loaf or Erin's sty be thine, Cloud-rolling Sheffield! want shall humble all. Town of the unbow'd poor! thou shalt not pine Like the fall'n rustic, licensed Rapine's thrall; But, first to rise, wilt be the last to fall! Slow are thy sons the pauper's trade to learn. Though, in the land that blossoms like the rose, The English peasant and the Irish kerne Fight for potatoes—thy proud labourer knows Nor Workhouse wages, nor the exile's woes. Not yet thy bit of beef, thy pint of ale, Thy toil-strung heart, which toil could ne'er dismay, Nor yet thy honest, skill'd right hand shall fail; Last, from thy hearths, the poor man's pride shall stray; And still shall come thy well-paid Saturday, And still thy morn of rest be near and sure. II. Light! all is not corrupt, for thou art pure, Unchanged, and changeless. Though frail man is vile, Thou look'st on him—serene, sublime, secure, Yet, like thy Father, with a pitying smile. Light! we may cloud thy beams, but not defile. Even on this wintry day, as marble cold, Angels might quit their home, to visit thee, And match their plumage with thy mantle, roll'd Beneath God's throne, o'er billows of a sea Whose isles are worlds, whose bounds infinity. Why then is Enoch absent from my side? I miss the rustle of his silver hair; A guide no more, I seem to want a guide, While Enoch journeys to the house of pray'r; And ne'er came Sabbath day but he was there! Lo, how like him, erect and strong, though grey, Yon village tower, time touch'd, to God appeals! But hark! the chimes of morning die away! Hark!—to the heart the solemn sweetness steals, Like the heart's voice, unfelt by none who feels That God is love, that man is living dust; Unfelt by none whom ties of brotherhood Link to his kind; by none who puts his trust In nought of earth that hath survived the flood, Save those mute charities, by which the good Strengthen poor worms, and serve their Maker best. III. Hail, Sabbath! day of mercy, peace, and rest! Thou o'er loud cities throw'st a noiseless spell. The hammer there, the wheel, the saw, molest Pale thought no more. O'er trade's contentious hell Meek quiet spreads her wings invisible. But when thou com'st, less silent are the fields Through whose sweet paths the toil-freed townsman steals. To him the very air a banquet yields. Envious, he watches the poised hawk, that wheels His flight on chainless winds. Each cloud reveals A paradise of beauty to his eye. His little boys are with him, seeking flowers, Or chasing the too venturous gilded fly. So by the daisy's side he spends the hours, Renewing friendship with the budding bowers; And—while might, beauty, good, without alloy, Are mirror'd in his children's happy eyes— In his great temple, offering thankful joy To Him, the infinitely Great and Wise, With soul attuned to Nature's harmonies, Serene, and cheerful, as a sporting child. His heart refuses to believe, that man Could turn into a hell the blooming wild The blissful country, where his childhood ran A race with infant rivers, ere began King-humbling, blind misrule his wolfish sway. IV. Is it the horn that, on this holy day, Insults the songs which rise, like incense sweet, From lowly roofs, where contrite sinners pray, And pious rustics, poor, yet clean and neat, To hear th' apostle of the hamlet, meet? They come, they come! behold, hark!—thundering down, Two headlong coaches urge the dreadful race; Woe to outsiders, should they be o'erthrown! Be ready, Doctor, if they break a trace! Twelve miles an hour — well done; a glorious pace! Poor horses, how they pant, and smoke, and strain! What then? our jails are full, and England thrives. Now, Bomb! now, Bomb! Defiance lends again; Hurrah? Bill Breakneck or the Devil drives! Whip!—populous England need not care for lives. O blessèd Sabbath! to the coach-horse thou Bringest no pause from daily toil. For him There is no day of rest. The laws allow His ever-batter'd hoof, and anguish'd limb, Till, death-struck, flash his brain with dizzy swim, Lo, while his nostrils flame, and, torture-scored, Quivers his flank beneath the ruthless goad, Stretch'd, on his neck each vein swells, like a cord! Hark! what a groan! The mute pedestrian, awed, Stops—while the steed sinks on the reeling road, Murder'd by hands that know not how to spare! V. Now landed Trader, that, with haughty stare, Throned in thy curtain'd pew, o'erlook'st the squire! Be kind and saintly; give, for thou can'st spare, A pittance to the destitute; enquire If yon pale trembler wants not food and fire? Though thou could'st thrive, say not all others can, But look and see how skill and toil are fed; Lo, merit is not food to every man! Pious thou art, and far thy fame is spread; But thy Saint Peter never preach'd cheap bread. Though bright the sun, cold blows the winter wind: Behold the tramper, with his naked toes! Where for the night shall he a lodging find? Or bid that homeless boy relate his woes; O try to feel what misery only knows, And be like him of Wincobank, who ne'er Sent a fall'n brother heart-struck from his door! Or be like Wentworth's lord, a blessing here! O imitate the steward of the poor, According to thy means, heav'n asks no more! Think of the hope of ten, the sire of nine, The proud, skill'd man, wheel-shatter'd yesterday: His wife will wring her hands ere eve decline; And, ah! the next week's wages, where are they? O soothe her, help her, name not parish pay! Think, too, of her, the maid who dwelt alone, Whose first, sole, hopeless love was Enoch Wray. Forgotten ere she died, she lived unknown, And told her love but once, passing away Like a slow shadow, in her tresses grey. Proud, though despised, she sternly paid for rent Her all, her weekly eighteenpence, and died, Rather than quit the home where she had spent Twice forty years. Her last pawn'd rug supplied A fortnight's food. None heard her if she sigh'd; None saw her if she wept; or saw too late, That tears were ice upon her lifeless face. Her Bible on her lap, before the grate That long had known no fire, gnawing a lace With toothless gums—the last of all her race— She died of cold and hunger in her chair. VI. The bell strikes twelve. The ancient house of prayer Pours forth its congregated youth and age; The rich, the poor, the gay, the sad, are there; And some go thence, who, in their hearts, presage That one week more will end their pilgrimage. First, in all haste, comes busy Bolus, croose As bantam cock, and neat as horse fresh poll'd. Then boys, all glad, as bottled wasps let loose, Clapping their hands because their toes are cold. Then the new Squire (more dreaded than the old) Raised from the milk-cart by his uncle's will— A Norfolk farmer he, who loved his joke, At tax-worn tradesmen aim'd, with practised skill; For, scorning trade, he throve, while traders broke, And did not care a straw for Mister Coke. Next, lo! the monarch of the village school, Slow Jedediah comes, not yet the last. Well can he bear the blame for stubborn fool; Meekly he bows to yeoman, stumping past, While Bolus, yet in sight, seems travelling fast. Thou, Jedediah, learnèd wight, know'st well Why rush the younglings from the porch with glee. Dear to thy heart is Nature's breezy fell; Deeply the captives' woes are felt by thee, For thou art Nature's, Freedom's devotee! Witness the moss that winter's rage defies, Cull'd yesterday, beside the lizard's home; Witness thou lichen of the precipice, Beautiful neighbour of the torrent's foam, Pluck'd, where the desert often sees him roam!— Next comes the train who better days have known, Condemn'd the taunts of paupers born to brook, With prostrate hearts, that mourn their hopes o'erthrown, And downcast eyes, that shun th' upbraiding look. Then comes his worship; then his worship's cook; And then, erect as truth, comes Enoch Wray, Bareheaded still, his cheek still wet with tears, Pondering the solemn text, as best he may. Lo, close behind, the curate meek appears! Kindly he greets the man of five-score years, The blind, the poor! while purse-pride turns away, And whispering asks, half-wishful, half-afraid, If Enoch has applied for parish pay? Short-sighted curate! ply the worldling's trade, Or, unpreferr'd, grow pale with hope delay'd, And die, the victim of low craft and spite. Short-sighted curate! do as worldlings do; Flatter the wolf, for he can snarl and bite. What, though thy life is pure, thy doctrine true? The Squireling hates thee; Bolus hates thee too. Physician, surgeon, umpire of thy flock! Dar'st thou be wise beyond the learnèd schools? How laughs the Doctor at thy little stock Of drugs and simples! Burn thy useful tools, Priest and Mechanic, scorn'd by knaves and fools! Then fawn on wealth and spurn the all-shunn'd poor. To grandeur's halls, a punctual dun, repair; Or still shall honest rags besiege thy door, And thou be found at Want's bedside in pray'r, While Pain moans low, and Death is watching there, And Hope sees better worlds beyond the sky. VII. Near yonder archer yews—that solemnly Keep aye upraised their desolate hands, in praise Of the old heav'ns, and hoar antiquity— Behold the Hall! There once dwelt Matthew Hayes, A trading yeoman of the bygone days. There, where his fathers sojourn'd on the plain, And damn'd the French, yet loved all humankind, His annual feast was spread, nor spread in vain; There his own acres billow'd in the wind Their golden corn. A man of vulgar mind, He laugh'd at learning, while he scrawl'd his cross, And rear'd his boy in sloth. But times grew worse: War came—and public waste brought private loss; And punctual bankruptcy, the thriving curse, Beggar'd his debtors, till an empty purse Answer'd all claims. He sold his land—then died, Following his broken-hearted wife—and left Their son, the heir of prejudice and pride, To drink, and swear, of self-respect bereft, And feed the day's debauch by nightly theft. Behold his home, that sternly could withstand The storms of more than twice a hundred years! In such a home was Shakspeare's “Hamlet” plann'd, And Raleigh's boyhood shed ambitious tears O'er Colon's wrongs. How proudly it uprears Its tower of cluster'd chimneys, tufted o'er With ivy, ever green amid the grey, Yet envy-stung, and muttering evermore To yon red villa, on the king's highway, “Thou dandy! I am not of yesterday.” Time seems to reverence these fantastic walls: Behold the gables quaint, the cornice strong, The chambers, bellying over latticed halls, The oaken tracery, outlasting long The carven stone; nor do their old age wrong With laughter vile, or heartless jest profane! VIII. Why, Enoch, dost thou start, as if in pain? The sound thou hear'st the blind alone could hear: Alas! Miles Gordon ne'er will walk again; But his poor grandson's footstep wakes thy tear, As if indeed thy long lost friend were near. Here oft, with fading cheek and thoughtful brow, Wanders the youth—town-bred, but desert-born. Too early taught life's deepening woes to know, He wakes in sorrow with the weeping morn, And gives much labour for a little corn. In smoke and dust, from hopeless day to day, He sweats, to bloat the harpies of the soil, Who jail no victim, while his pangs can pay. Untaxing rent, and trebly taxing toil, They make the labour of his hands their spoil, And grind him fiercely; but he still can get A crust of wheaten bread, despite their frowns; They have not sent him like a pauper yet For Workhouse wages, as they send their clowns; Such tactics do not answer yet in towns. Nor have they gorged his soul. Thrall though he be, Of brutes who bite him while he feeds them, still He feels his intellectual dignity, Works hard, reads usefully, with no mean skill Writes, and can reason well of good and ill. He hoards his weekly groat. His tear is shed For sorrows which his hard-worn hand relieves. Too poor, too proud, too just, too wise to wed, (For slaves enough already toil for thieves,) How gratefully his growing mind receives The food which tyrants struggle to withhold! Though hourly ills his every sense invade Beneath the cloud that o'er his home is roll'd, He yet respects the power which man hath made, Nor loathes the despot-humbling sons of trade. But, when the silent Sabbath-day arrives, He seeks the cottage, bordering on the moor, Where his forefathers pass'd their lowly lives— Where still his mother dwells, content though poor, And ever glad to meet him at the door. Oh, with what rapture he prepares to fly From streets and courts, with crime and sorrow strew'd, And bids the mountain lift him to the sky! How proud, to feel his heart not all subdued! How happy to shake hands with Solitude! Still, Nature, still he loves thy uplands brown— That rock, that o'er his father's freehold towers! And strangers, hurrying through the dingy town, May know his workshop by its sweet wild flowers. Cropp'd on the Sabbath from the hedge-side bowers, The hawthorn blossom in his window droops; Far from the headlong stream and lucid air The pallid alpine rose to meet him stoops, As if to soothe a brother in despair, Exiled from Nature and her pictures fair. E'en winter sends a posy to his jail, Wreath'd of the sunny celandine—the brief, Courageous windflower, loveliest of the frail— The hazel's crimson star—the woodbine's leaf— The daisy with its half-closed eye of grief— Prophets of fragrance, beauty, joy, and song! IX. Bird! who would swelter with the laden throng, That had thy wings? Earth spurners, you are free! But thou must drag the chains of life along, And, all but hopeless, till thou cease to be, Toil, woe-worn Artisan! Yet, unlike thee Is minion'd Erin's sty'd and root-fed clown. How unlike thee, though once erect and proud, Is England's peasant slave, the trodden down, The parish-paid, in soul and body bow'd! How unlike thee is Jem, the rogue avow'd, Whose trade is poaching! Honest Jem works not, Begs not, but thieves by plundering beggars here. Wise as a lord, and quite as good a shot, He, like his betters, lives in hate and fear, And feeds on partridge, because bread is dear. Sire of six sons, apprenticed to the jail, He prowls in arms, the tory of the night; With them he shares his battles and his ale; With him they feel the majesty of might; No despot better knows that Power is Right. Mark his unpaidish sneer, his lordly frown; Hark, how he calls beadle and flunky liars! See how magnificently he breaks down His neighbour's fence, if so his will requires! And how his struttle emulates the Squire's! And how like Mistress Gig, late Betty Scrubb, Or Mister Dunghill, with his British pride, He takes the wall of Glossin and his cub, Or loyal Guts, who, bursting, coughs, to hide The wounded meanness he mistakes for pride! Jem rises with the moon; but when she sinks, Homeward, with sack-like pockets, and quick heels, Hungry as boroughmongering ghoul, he slinks. He reads not, writes not, thinks not—scarcely feels; Insolent ape! whate'er he gets he steals, Then plays the devil with his righteous gain! X. O thou, whom conquer'd seas made great in vain, Fall'n Venice! Ocean Queen no more! oppress'd Nurse of true slaves, and lords whom slaves disdain! Whisper thy sickening sister of the West That Trade hath wings, to fly from climes unbless'd! Trade, the transformer, that turns dross to bread, And reaps rich harvests on the barren main; Trade, that uproots wild flowers, and from their bed Digs forth hard steel, to hew the bondman's chain: Tamer of Tyrants, else opposed in vain! And ye—once guardians of the fainting state, Shades of the Rockinghams and Savilles! ye Who lived when paupers did not dine on plate! Wake!—can ye sleep? Indignant, wake! and see Alms-taking wealth, alms-giving poverty! Thou, too, undemonizer of the proud! Religion, that canst raise and dignify The heart which abject penury hath bow'd! From gorgeous climes beneath the eastern sky, Call home the lightning of thy seraph eye; Gird thy almighty loins; thy work begin! Plead for the pariah of the isles of woes, And speak, with Luther's voice, to giant Sin! So may the year of tortured ages close Ere the slow Angel start from his repose, Like Stanedge, shaking thunder from his mane! XI. But who will listen when the poor complain? Who read, or hear, a tale of woe, if true? Ill fares the friendless Muse of want and pain. Fool! would'st thou prosper, and be honest, too? Fool! would'st thou prosper? Flatter those who do! If, not unmindful of the all-shunn'd poor, Thou write on tablets frail their troubles deep, The proud, the vain, will scorn thy theme obscure. What wilt thou earn, though lowly hearts may steep With tears the page in which their sorrows weep? Growl, if thou wilt, in vulgar sympathy With plunder'd labour; pour thy honest bile In satire, hiss'd at base prosperity; And let his enviers, from their pittance vile, Reward the pauper virtues of thy style. But, hark! what accents of what slave enquire Why rude mechanics dare to wield the quill? He bids me from the scribbler's desk retire, Rehoof my fingers, and forget my skill In railing foully, and in writing ill. O that my poesy were like the child That gathers daisies from the lap of May, With prattle sweeter than the bloomy wild! It then might teach poor Wisdom to be gay As flowers, and birds, and rivers, all at play, And winds, that make the voiceless clouds of morn Harmonious. But distemper'd, if not mad, I feed on Nature's bane, and mess with scorn. I would not, could not if I would, be glad, But, like shade-loving plants, am happiest sad. My heart, once soft as woman's tear, is gnarl'd With gloating on the ills I cannot cure. Like Arno's exiled bard, whose music snarl'd, I gird my loins to suffer and endure, And woo Contention, for her dower is sure. Tear not thy gauze, thou garden-seeking fly, On thorny flowers, that love the dangerous storm, And flourish most beneath the coldest sky! But ye who honour truth's enduring form, Come! there are heath flowers, and the fangèd worm, Clouds, gorse, and whirlwind, on the gorgeous moor. BOOK IV. CONTENTS. Recitation of Manfred to Enoch Wray—Byron and his Contemporaries—First Perusal of “Schiller's Robbers:” followed by the Blindness of the Patriarch—Further Particulars of his History and Character. I. Enoch, the lights are darken'd on the hill, But in the house a thoughtful watch is set; Warm on the ancient hearth fire glimmers still; Nor do the travellers their way forget; Nor is the grasshopper a burthen yet. Though blossoms on the mountain top the snow, The maids of music yet are lingering near; Still are the wakeful listeners wise to know; Still to thy soul the voice of song is dear. And when I read to thee that vision drear— The Manfred of stern Byron—thou didst bend, Fix'd, to drink in each touching word and tone. On thy changed cheek I saw strong feeling blend Impetuous hues; and tears fell, one by one, From thy closed eyes, as on the moorland stone The infant river drops its crystal chill. II. Say, then, is Pope our prince of poets still? Or may we boast, in these all rhyming days, One climber of the Heliconian hill, Whose classic spirit and unborrow'd lays Johnson or caustic Swift had deign'd to praise? Scott, whose invention is a magic loom; Baillie, artificer of deathless dreams; Moore, the Montgomery of the drawing-room; Montgomery, the Moore of solemn themes; Crabbe, whose dark gold is richer than it seems; Keats, that sad name, which time shall write in tears; Poor Burns, the Scotchman, who was not a slave; Campbell, whom Freedom's deathless Hope endears; White, still remember'd in his cruel grave; Ill-fated Shelley, vainly great and brave; Wordsworth, whose thoughts acquaint us with our own; Didactic, earnest Cowper, grave and gay; Wild Southey, flying, like the hern, alone; And dreamy Coleridge, of the wizard lay: These are true bards, who please not Enoch Wray! But may not Byron, dark and grand, compete With him who sung Belinda's ravish'd tress? Chaste is the muse of Pope, and passing sweet; But Byron is all fervour, rivalless In might and passion. Woman's tenderness— When woman is most tender, most deplored— Moves not like his; and still, when least divine, He is a god, whose shrines shall be restored— Apollo, self-dethroned. His mind a mine Where night-born gems in cherish'd darkness shine, He—thrice a Ford, twice an Euripides, And half a Schiller—hath a Milton's power, But not a Shakspeare's; strength, and fire, and ease, And almost grace; though gloomy as the tower Around whose dangerous brow storms love to lower, His world is all within, like Enoch Wray's. III. The full-blown flower, maturely fair, displays Intensest beauty, and the enamour'd wind Drinks its deep fragrance. But could lengthen'd days Have ripen'd to more worth dark Byron's mind, And purged his thoughts from taint of earth refined? Or would he have sent forth a fiercer glow, And gloomier splendour, from his core of fire? We know not what he might have been, but know What he could not be. Proud of his high lyre, We mourn the dead, who never can expire. Proud of his fearless frown, his burning tear; Proud of the poet of all hearts, who heard The mute reproach of Greece; with zeal severe, We scrutinize our least injurious word, Nor longer deem his spleeny whims absurd, His pangs ridiculous, his weakness crime. IV. Heaven's fav'rites are short lived. Stern fate and time Will have their victims; and the best die first, Leaving the bad still strong, though past their prime, To curse the hopeless world they ever cursed, Vaunting vile deeds, and vainest of the worst. And he who cannot perish is no more! He died who is immortal, and must be, To time's slow years, like ocean to the shore, The sun to heav'n! He died where fell the free Of ancient Greece; and Greeks his loss deplore. There, where they fight, as fought their sires of yore, In the great cause of all the good and great, Liberty's martyr, England's, Europe's pride, Girding his broken heart, he champion'd fate, And laid down life—though not as Russell died, To him, “by better ties than blood,” allied. Beyond the deep he perish'd, far from all That darken'd death with love; and, though the wave Leagued with his foes to mock his dying call, His dust is where his heart was, when he gave Years of defeated glory for a grave, Sighing in death his deathless love and woe. V. Father! thy life has been prolong'd, to know Strange times, strange men, strange changes, and strange lays; The warrior-bard whom Athens, long ago, Crown'd peerless heir of never-dying praise, Hath found a greater. In those fearful days When, tempest-driv'n, and toss'd on troubled seas, Thought, like the petrel, loved the whirlwind best, And o'er the waves, and through the foam, with ease, Rose up into the black cloud's thund'rous breast, To rouse the lightning from his gloomy rest; Then, in the shadow of the mountains, dwelt A lady, to whose heart high hopes were dear, Who wildly thought, and passionately felt, And strangely dream'd, that man—the slave of Fear, And Pain, and Want—might be an angel here. Full oft that lady of the glen remote Called Enoch her wise mason; oft partook His humble meal, while, mirror'd in his thought, The pensive past assumed her own sweet look. 'Twas then she gave him her last gift, a book Dark with strange power, and fearfully divine. It chill'd his blood, it lifted up his hair; Spirits of terror lived in every line; A spell was on its pages of despair, And burning woes, which Nature could not bear. 'Twas grand, but dreadful as the thoughts that wrung The son of morning, from the solar beam Hurl'd to the centre, where his soul, unstrung, Disdained submission still, too proud to seem Unvanquish'd. Was it but a fearful dream, That tale of Schiller's? Did the robber Moor Pierce through Amelia's broken heart his own? Smite the dark tower and shake the iron door? And was he answered by a father's groan?— Th' Avonian seer hath ceased to stand alone. But thou no more shalt printed vision read, Enoch! that dire perusal was thy last; For, from thine eyeballs, with a spirit's speed, Gone, and for ever, light and beauty pass'd. Not that a horror and a woe too vast Had quench'd thy brilliant orbs: nor was thy doom Like his—the bard who sang of Eden's bowers, The bard of lofty thought, all fire and gloom, All might and purity—whose awful powers, Too darkly strong for organs frail as ours, Press'd on his visual nerve a pall-like night: But God, who chastens whom he loves, ordain'd, Although thy frame was vigorous, thy step light, Thy spirit like th' autumnal gale unrein'd— That thine should be affliction, well sustain'd, To show the proud what humble worth can bear. VI. Then hither, Pride, with tearless eyes repair! Come, and learn wisdom from unmurmuring woe, That, 'reft of early hope, yet scorns despair. Still in his bosom light and beauty glow, Though darkness took him captive long ago. Nor is the man of five-score years alone: A heav'nly form, in pity, hovers near; He listens to a voice of tenderest tone, Whose accents sweet the happy cannot hear; And, lo, he dashes from his cheek a tear, Caught by an angel shape, with tresses pale. He sees her, in his soul. How fix'd he stands! But, oh, can angels weep? Can grief prevail O'er spirits pure? She waves her thin, white hands; And while her form recedes, her eye expands, Gazing on joys which he who seeks shall find. There is an eye that watches o'er the blind: He hath a friend—“not lost, but gone before”— Who left her image in his heart behind. But when his hands, in darkness, trembled o'er Her lifeless features, and he heard no more The voice whose last tone bless'd him, frenzy came! Blindness on blindness! midnight thick and deep, Too heavy to be felt!—then pangs, like flame, That sear'd the brain—sorrow that could not weep; Fever, that would have barter'd worlds for sleep! He had no tears, but those that inly pour, And scald the heart; no slumbers, but the doze That stuns the mourner who can hope no more; But he had shudderings, stupor, nameless woes, Horror, which only he that suffers knows. But frenzy did not kill. His iron frame, Though shaken, stood. The mind's night faded slow. Then would he call upon his daughter's name, Because it was her mother's! And his woe Waned into resignation, pleased to show A face of peace, without the smile it wore. Nor did the widower learn again to smile Until his daughter to her Albert bore Another Mary, and on yonder stile He nursed the babe, that sweetly could beguile, With looks unseen, “all sadness but despair.” VII. Nay, Enoch, do not weep. The day is fair, And flings bright lightnings from his helm abroad; Let us drink deep the pure and lucid air, Ere darkness call thee to her damp abode. Hark, how the titling whistles o'er the road! Holm, plume thy palms! and toss thy purple Torse Elm! but, Wood Rose, be not a bride too soon! Snows yet may shroud alive the golden gorse: Thou early-green! deem not thy bane a boon; Distrust the day that changeth like the moon. But still our father weeps. Ah! though all hues Are dead to him, the floral hours shall yet Shed o'er his heart their fragrance-loving dews! E'en now, the daisy, like a gem, is set, Though faint and rare, in winter's coronet. Thy sisters sleep, adventurous windflower pale! And thy meek blush affronts the celandine, The starry herald of that gentlest gale Whose plumes are sunbeams, dipp'd in odours fine: Well may'st thou blush; but sad blight will be thine, If glowing day shut frore in stormy night. VIII. Still dost thou weep, old man? The day is bright, And spring is near: come, take a youngster's arm; Come, let us wander where the flocks delight At noon to sun them, when the sun is warm; And visit them, beyond thy uncle's farm, The one-arch'd bridge—thy glory, and thy pride, Thy Parthenon, the triumph of thy skill; Which still bestrides, and long it shall bestride, The discontented stream, from hill to hill, Laughing to scorn the moorland torrent still. How many years hath he slept in the tomb Who swore thy bridge would yield to one year's rain! E'en London folks, to see and praise it, come; And envious masons pray, with shame and pain, For skill like Enoch Wray's, but pray in vain. For he could do what others could not learn, First having learn'd what Heav'n alone can teach: The parish idiot might his skill discern; And younglings, with the shell upon their breech, Left top and taw, to listen to his speech. The barber, proudest of mankind confest His equal worth—“or so the story ran”— Whate'er he did, all own'd, he did it best; And e'en the bricklayer, his sworn foe, began To say, that Enoch was no common man. Had he carved beauty in the cold white stone, (Like Law, the unknown Phidias of our day,) The village Angelo had quail'd to none Whom critics eulogize, or princes pay; And ne'er had Chantrey equall'd Enoch Wray, Forgotten relic of a world that was! But thou art not forgotten, though, alas! Thou art become a stranger, sunny nook, On which the changeful seasons, as they pass, Wait ever kindly! He no more will look On thee, warm bank! will see thy hermit brook No more, no more. But kindled at the blaze Of day, thy fragrance makes thy presence known. Behold! he counts his footsteps as he strays! He feels that he is near thy verdure lone; And his heart whispers, that thy flowers are blown, Pale primrose, know'st thou Enoch? Long ago Thy fathers knew him; and their child is dear, Because he loved them. See, he bends him low, With reverend grace, to thee—and drops a tear. “I see thee not,” he sighs, “but thou art here; Speak to a poor, blind man! And thou canst speak To the lone blind. Still, still thy tones can reach His listening heart, and soothe, or bid it break. Oh, memory hears again the thrilling speech Of thy meek beauty! Fain his hand would reach And pluck thee—No! that would be sacrilege. BOOK V. CONTENTS. An Excursion with Enoch Wray to the Mountains—Beautiful Winter Morning—Rivers of Hallamshire—Short Lived Grinder, contrasted with the Patriarch—The Moors—Mountain Bee— Enfeebled Snake—Lost Lad—The Desert, a fit Abode for Spirits—Christ's Love of Solitude—Reflections, suggested by the Desolation of the Scene. I. Come, Father of the Hamlet! grasp again Thy stern ash plant, cut when the woods were young; Come, let us leave the plough-subjected plain, And rise, with freshen'd hearts, and nerves restrung, Into the azure dome, that, haply, hung O'er thoughtful power, ere suffering had begun. II. Flowers peep, trees bud, boughs tremble, rivers run; The redwing saith, it is a glorious morn. Blue are thy Heavens, thou Highest! and thy sun Shines without cloud, all fire. How sweetly, borne On wings of morning o'er the leafless thorn, The tiny wren's small twitter warbles near! How swiftly flashes in the stream the trout! Woodbine! our father's ever-watchful ear Knows, by thy rustle, that thy leaves are out. The trailing bramble hath not yet a sprout; Yet harshly to the wind the wanton prates, Not with thy smooth lisp, woodbine of the fields! Thou future treasure of the bee, that waits Gladly on thee, spring's harbinger! when yields All bounteous earth her odorous flowers, and builds The nightingale, in beauty's fairest land. III. Five rivers, like the fingers of a hand, Flung from black mountains, mingle, and are one Where sweetest valleys quit the wild and grand, And eldest forests, o'er the silvan Don, Bid their immortal brother journey on, A stately pilgrim, watch'd by all the hills. Say, shall we wander where, through warrior's graves, The infant Yewden, mountain-cradled, trills Her doric notes? Or, where the Locksley raves Of broil and battle, and the rocks and caves Dream yet of ancient days? Or, where the sky Darkens o'er Rivilin, the clear and cold, That throws his blue length, like a snake, from high? Or, where deep azure brightens into gold O'er Sheaf, that mourns in Eden? Or, where roll'd On tawny sands, through regions passion-wild, And groves of love, in jealous beauty dark, Complains the Porter, Nature's thwarted child, Born in the waste, like headlong Wiming? Hark! The poised hawk calls thee, Village Patriarch! He calls thee to his mountains! Up, away! Up, up, to Stanedge! higher still ascend, Till kindred rivers, from the summit grey, To distant seas their course in beauty bend, And, like the lives of human millions, blend Disparted waves in one immensity! IV. Beautiful rivers of the desert! ye Bring food for labour from the foodless waste. Pleased stops the wanderer on his way, to see The frequent weir oppose your heedless haste. Where toils the Mill, by ancient woods embraced, Hark, how the cold steel screams in hissing fire? But Enoch sees the Grinder's wheel no more, Couch'd beneath rocks and forests, that admire Their beauty in the waters, ere they roar Dash'd in white foam the swift circumference o'er. There draws the Grinder his laborious breath; There, coughing, at his deadly trade he bends. Born to die young, he fears nor man nor death; Scorning the future, what he earns he spends; Debauch and Riot are his bosom friends. He plays the Tory, sultan-like and well: Woe to the traitor that dares disobey The Dey of Straps! as rattan'd tools shall tell. Full many a lordly freak, by night, by day, Illustrates gloriously his lawless sway. Behold his failings! hath he virtues, too? He is no pauper, blackguard though he be. Full well he knows what minds combined can do, Full well maintains his birthright—He is free! And, frown for frown, outstares monopoly! Yet Abraham and Elliot, both in vain, Mr. Abraham improved, it is said, and Mr. John Elliot invented, the grinder's preservative, which the grinders will not use! Bid science on his cheek prolong the bloom; He will not live! he seems in haste to gain The undisturb'd asylum of the tomb, And, old at two-and-thirty, meets his doom! Man of a hundred years, how unlike thee! V. But steeper hills look down on stream and tree; I pray thee, pause, or, lo, I lag behind! Ah, thou wilt prove an overmatch for me, Despite the sad erectness of the blind. Whoever walks with thee, though young, will find 'Tis hard for youth to emulate thy age. They were adventurous Sampsons, that would try To lift a load with Enoch, or engage To fling a heavier quoit. And thigh to thigh, And foot to foot, placed well and warily, He who throws thee had need be in his prime. VI. The moors—all hail! Ye changeless, ye sublime, That seldom hear a voice, save that of Heav'n! Scorners of chance, and fate, and death, and time, But not of Him, whose viewless hand hath riv'n The chasm, through which the mountain stream is driv'n! How like a prostrate giant—not in sleep, But listening to his beating heart—ye lie! With winds and clouds dread harmony ye keep; Ye seem alone beneath the boundless sky; Ye speak, are mute—and there is no reply! Here all is sapphire light, and gloomy land, Blue, brilliant sky, above a sable sea Of hills, like chaos, ere the first command, “Let there be light!” bade light and beauty be. But thou art here, thou rarest cloudberry! O health-restorer! did he know thy worth, The bilious townsman would for thee resign His wall-grown peach, well pleased. In moorland earth Thee would he plant, thou more than nectarine! Thou better grape! and, in thy fruit divine, Quaff strength and beauty from the living bough. VII. This scene is ancient, Enoch must allow. Marble is less enduring than the flower That wither'd ages hence, and withers now, Where, black as night, th' unalter'd mountain's tower, And baffled Time sees things that mock his power. I thank ye, billows of a granite sea, That the bribed plough, defeated, halts below! And thanks, majestic Barrenness, to thee, For one grim region in a land of woe, Where tax-sown wheat and paupers will not grow. Here pause, old Man, the alpine air to taste: Drink it from Nature's goblet, while the morn Speaks like a fiery trumpet to the waste. Here despot grandeur reigns in pomp forlorn. Despair might sojourn here, with bosom torn, And long endure, but never smile again. Hail to the tempest's throne, the cloud's high road, Lone as the agèd sky, and hoary main! The path we tread the Sherwood outlaws trode, Where no man bideth, Locksley's band abode, And urged the salient roe through bog and brake. VIII. Know'st thou our father, thou enfeebled snake, That seek'st the sun too soon? Dost thou, in awe And love, the seldom trodden path forsake? To him, thou seem'st the very snake he saw In ruddy boyhood. While thy folds withdraw, Uncoil'd o'er cranshy roots, and fern-stalks dry, He thinks he sees thee, colour'd like the stone, With cruel and atrocious Tory eye, And anxious look of dog that seeketh bone, Or sour Scotch placeman, when his place is gone, To feed some Whiggish fool, who will not eat. IX. Bee! that hast left thy sandy-coved retreat Before the living purple hath purvey'd Food for thee; potent pigmy! that the fleet Wing'd moments of the past, and years, array'd In patch-work, from the robe of things decay'd, Recall'st from sad oblivion! thou canst do What mightest spirits cannot—Silence hears Thy murmur; and our sire, who hears it too, Lives o'er again a hundred pensive years. Pathetic insect! thou hast brought fresh tears To sightless eye-balls, and a channel'd cheek. O that once more he could become a boy, And see the morning o'er the mountains break In clouds of fire, which, army-like, deploy— That he might chase thee, with a hunter's joy, Vainly, o'er moss, and heath, and plumy fern! X. Father! we stand upon the mountain stern, That cannot feel our lightness, and disdains Reptiles, that sting and perish in their turn, That hiss and die—and lo! no trace remains Of all their joys, their triumphs, and their pains! Yet to stand here might well exalt the mind: These are not common moments, nor is this A common scene. Hark, how the coming wind Booms, like the funeral dirge of woe, and bliss, And life, and form, and mind, and all that is! How like the wafture of a world-wide wing It sounds and sinks—and all is hush'd again! But are our spirits humbled? No! We string The lyre of death with mystery and pain, And proudly hear the dreadful notes complain That man is not the whirlwind, but the leaf, Torn from the tree to soar and disappear. Grand is our weakness, and sublime our grief. Lo! on this rock, I shake off hope and fear, And stand released from clay! yet am I here, And at my side are blindness, age, and woe. XI. Far to the left where streams disparted flow, Rude as his home of granite, dark and cold, In ancient days, beneath the mountain's brow, Dwelt, with his son, a widower poor and old. Two steeds he had, whose manes and forelocks bold Comb ne'er had touch'd; and daily to the town They dragg'd the rock, from moorland quarries torn. Years roll'd away. The son, to manhood grown, Married his equal; and a boy was born, Dear to the grandsire's heart. But pride, and scorn, And avarice, fang'd the mother's small grey eyes, That dully shone, like studs of tarnish'd lead. She poison'd soon her husband's mind with lies; Soon nought remain'd to cheer the old man's shed, Save the sweet boy, that nightly shared his bed. And worse days were at hand. The son defied The father—seized his goods, his steeds, his cart: The old man saw, and, unresisting, sigh'd: But when the child, unwilling to depart, Clung to his knees, then spoke the old man's heart In gushing tears. “The floor,” he said, “is dry: Let the poor boy sleep with me this one night.” “Nay,” said the mother; and she twitch'd awry Her rabid lip; and dreadful was the sight, When the dwarf'd vixen dash'd, with fiendish spite, Her tiny fist into the old man's face; While he, soft-hearted giant, sobb'd and wept. But the child triumph'd! Rooted to the place, Clasping the agèd knees, his hold he kept, And once more in his grandsire's bosom slept. And nightly still, and every night the boy Slept with his grandsire, on the rush-strewn floor, Till the old man forgot his wrongs, and joy Revisited the cottage of the moor. But a sad night was darkening round his door: The snow had melted silently away, And, at the gloaming, ceased the all-day rain; But the child came not. Wherefore did he stay? The old man rose, nor long look'd forth in vain; The stream was bellowing from the hills amain, And screams were mingled with its sullen roar: “The boy is in the burn,” said he, dismay'd, And rush'd forth, wild with anguish. From the shore He plunged; then, staggering, with both hands display'd, Caught, screaming, at the boy, who shriek'd for aid, And sank and raised his hands, and rose, and scream'd! He leap'd; he struck o'er eddying foam; he cast His wilder'd glance o'er waves that yelp'd and gleam'd; And wrestled with the stream, that grasp'd him fast, Like a bird struggling with a serpent vast. Still, as he miss'd his aim, more faintly tried The boy to scream; still down the torrent went The lessening cries; and soon, far off, they died; While o'er the waves, that still their boom forth sent, Descended, coffin-black, the firmament. Morn came: the boy return'd not: noon was nigh; And then the mother sought the hut in haste. There sat the wretched man, with glaring eye; And in his arms the lifeless child, embraced, Lay like a darkening snow-wreath on the waste. “God curse thee, dog! what hast thou done?” she cried, And fiercely on his horrid eye-balls gazed: Nor hand, nor voice, nor dreadful eyes replied; Still on the corpse he stared with head unraised; But in his fix'd eyes light unnatural blazed, For Mind had left them, to return no more. Man of the wither'd heart-strings! is it well? Long in the grave hath slept the maniac hoar; But of the “lost lad” still the mountains tell, When shriek the spirits of the hooded fell, And, many-voiced, comes down the foaming snow. XII. Hail! silence of the desert!—I speak low In reverence—here the falcon's wing is awed, As o'er the deep repose, sublimely slow, He wheels in conscious majesty abroad. Spirits should make the desert their abode. The meekest, purest, mightiest, that e'er wore Dust as a garment, stole from crowds unbless'd To sea-like forests, or the sea-beat shore, And utter'd, on the star-sought mountain's breast, The holiest precepts e'er to dust address'd. Oh, happy souls of death-freed men, if here Ye wander, in your noiseless forms, unseen! Though not remote, removed from grief and fear, And all that pride shall be, and guilt hath been; While gentle death his shadow casts between Thoughts seraph-wing'd, and man's infirmity! XIII. To live unseen, but not to cease to be! Unheard, unseen, with men, or rocks, to dwell! O that I were all thought and memory, A wing'd intelligence invisible! Then would I read the virgin's fears, and tell Delicious secrets to her lover's heart, By spectre-haunted wood, or wizard stream; Or bid the awful form of Justice start, And prompt the conscience-stricken murderer's scream; Or scourge the rich man, in his ghastly dream, For heartless deeds, unwept, and unatoned. XIV. Hail, Desolation! Solitude! and, throned On changeless rocks, Eternity! Look down, And say, What see ye?—Want, that vainly groan'd, While Mercy gave him stones for food! The frown Of guilt, on minds and hearts, in ruins strown! Hate, torturing Constancy, that loved too well! Majestic things, in gnats that live an hour! Soul-bartering Faction, fain to buy or sell, And 'spoused to Fraud, with kingdoms for a dower! Ye sister forms of Nature's dread and power! Stand ye upon the earth? Heav'n hath no cloud To be a carpet for your dismal feet. Ye stand upon the earth, and skies are bow'd To knee your throne, this granite-pillar'd seat, That is, and was, and shall be. Wildly beat, Beneath your footstool, passions, feelings, deeds, Like billows on the solitary shore, Where baffled wave to baffled wave succeeds, Spurn'd by the sullen rocks, with sullen roar, And rising, falling, foaming evermore, To rise, and fall, and roar, and foam in vain. XV. Ye rocks! ye elements! thou shoreless main, In whose blue depths, worlds, ever voyaging, Freighted with life and death, of fate complain! Things of immutability! ye bring Thoughts that with sorrow and with terror wring The human breast. Unchanged, of sad decay And deathless change ye speak, like prophets old, Foretelling Evil's ever-present day; And, as when Horror lays his finger cold Upon the heart in dreams, appal the bold. O thou, Futurity, our hope and dread, Let me unveil thy features, fair or foul! Thou, who shalt see the grave untenanted. And commune with the re-embodied soul! Tell me thy secrets, ere thy ages roll Their deeds, that yet shall be on earth, in heav'n, And in deep hell, where rabid hearts with pain Must purge their plagues, and learn to be forgiven! Show me the beauty that shall fear no stain, And still, through age-long years, unchanged remain! As one who dreads to raise the pallid sheet Which shrouds the beautiful and tranquil face That yet can smile, but never more shall meet, With kisses warm, his ever-fond embrace; So, I draw nigh to thee, with timid pace, And tremble, though I long to lift thy veil. BOOK VI. CONTENTS. Enoch Wray versifies his Dream—His Anxiety to recite his Composition to his Neighbour, Alice Green—Snow-storm. I. Dreams! are ye vapours of the heated brain, Or echoes of our deeds, our fears, our hopes? Fever'd remembrances, that o'er again Tell prose adventures, in poetic tropes, While drowsy judgment with illusion copes Feebly and vainly? Are ye paid when due? Or, like our cobweb wealth, unfound when sought? Be ye of stirling value, weigh'd and true, Or the mere paper currency of thought, By spendthrift fancy sign'd, and good for nought— Enoch hath dream'd a dream, like saddest truth, And done it into rhyme. And Alice Green— The shrewish village quack, and ever sooth Interpreter of dreams—can tell, I ween, What signs and omens, rhymed or rhymeless mean. With all a poet's ardour to rehearse A vision, like the Florentine's of yore, Feverish and nervous, muttering deathless verse, He opens oft, and oft he shuts the door, And every leaden minute seems a score. But he is storm-bound. To the marsh below, While squattering ducks decend, and, with pale beams, The hooded, ineffectual sun, through snow That fell all night, and still is falling, gleams, Like reason, struggling half awake, in dreams, He hears the redbreast peck the frosted pane, Asking admittance to the warm fireside; And—while o'er muffled ruts each cart and wain Moves without sound—he opes the casement wide, To hail once more the guest he ne'er denied; Then spreads his hands, to feel if yet the plumes Of heav'n are wavering in the noiseless air; Determined—when the burden'd sky resumes Its lucid azure, clear, and cold, and fair— Through paths of hidden peril to repair, And have some harmless fun with Alice Green. How wild, how wondrous, and how changed the scene Since yesterday! On hill and valley bright Then look'd broad heav'n, all splendid and serene; And earth and sky were beauty, music, light. But now the storm-cock shakes the powdery white, With start impatient, from his shivering wings; And, on the maple's loaded bough depress'd, Perch'd o'er the buried daisy sweetly sings, With modulated throat and speckled breast, To cheer the hen bird, drooping in the nest On dusky eggs, with many a dot and streak. II. Love of the celandine and primrose meek! Star of the leafless hazel! where art thou? Where is the windflower, with its modest cheek? Larch! hast thou dash'd from thy denuded brow Blossoms, that stole their rose-hues from the glow Of Even, blushing into dreams of love? Flowers of the wintry beam and faithless sky! Gems of the wither'd bank and shadeless grove! Ye are where he who mourns you soon must lie; Beneath the shroud ye slumber, tranquilly; But not for ever. Yet a sudden hour Shall thaw the spotless mantle of your sleep, And bid it, melted into thunder, pour From mountain, waste, and fell, with foamy sweep, Whelming the flooded plain in ruin deep. Yes, little silent minstrels of the wild, Your voiceless song shall touch the heart again! And shall no morning dawn on Sorrow's child? Shall buried mind for ever mute remain Beneath the sod, from which your beauteous strain Shall yet arise in music, felt, not heard? No! Faith, Hope, Love, Fear, Gladness, Frailty, all, Forbid that man should perish. Like the bird That soars and sings in Nature's festival, Our souls shall rise—and fear no second fall— Our adoration strike a lyre divine! III. Now, through the clearing storm, the sunbeams shine; And, lo! the fluttering flakes are winnow'd fire! Thinner and thinner fall the fleeces fine; From mantled fells the umber'd clouds retire; And heav'n, that stoop'd to earth, is lifted higher. How Nature dazzles in her bridal vest! Like air-blown fire on fire is light on snow. A long-lost feeling wakes in Enoch's breast; His sightless eye-balls feel a sapphire glow, That speaks of hues and forms dead long ago— The bright, the wild, the beautiful, the grand! BOOK VII. CONTENTS. Enoch Wray's Dream. I. Gone! are ye gone? Bright dreams of youth, adieu! Old, blind, and poor, I dream of dreadful things. Methought I saw a man, renown'd and true, Rise from the grave, upborne on sable wings, Bradshaw his name, abhorr'd by slaves and kings. His hue was Death's, his majesty his own. There was a thoughtful calmness in his air: Decision, like a ready sword undrawn, Reposed, but slept not, on his forehead bare; But Caution, too, and deep research were there. At first, his lip curl'd fiercely, as he went O'er fields, o'er towns, o'er souls, in baseness bow'd; But, meeken'd soon, his awful visage blent Sad beauty with his sternness, like the cloud Whose tears are lightnings. “What!” he cried aloud, “Is tyranny immortal? Oh, if here Freedom yet linger, in what hated shed, Where proud endurance scorns to drop a tear, And woe-nursed virtues eat their hard-earn'd bread, Nerves she the heart and hand that despots dread? Hide not thy head in clouds, thou Rock, that saw'st The Pyms and Hampdens! these, our sons, can feel The pang of shame, though, dwarf'd in soul, they boast Nor manly thoughts, nor hearts, nor hands of steel, Like those that battled for the common weal. Say, Rock, is that a Briton? that mean thing, Who dares not lift his eyes above the feet Of pauper Satraps, or the village king Whom they depute to torture and to cheat? Slave—free to toil, that idle wolves may eat! What is a Briton? One who runs away, To barter souls for untax'd wine abroad, And curse his brutes, who sweat at home, and bray. Art thou a Briton, Ass, that lov'st the goad, And bray'st in honour of thy glorious load?— Say, palaced pauper, drunk with misery's tears, Did Russell, Fairfax, spring from gods like thee? Or, scourge for poverty! is this Algiers? Dog of the bread-tax-eating Absentee! Our children feed thy lord—why growl at me? Where are thy paper wings of yesterday, Thou bankrupt gambler for the landed knave?— Audacious poacher, scorn'st thou parish pay? Kill'st thou God's hares to shun a beggar's grave? What! is it better to be thief than slave?— Wretch, that did'st kill thy sire, to sell him dead! Art thou a Briton? Thou hast Strafford's brow. Poor, corn-bill'd weaver, singing hymns for bread! Could Hampden breathe where crawl such worms as thou? Spirit of Pym! lo, these are Britons now! Charles Stuart! are they worthy to be thine? Thou smil'st in scorn, in triumph, and in pride. And thou, at Marston taught by right divine, Thou recreant patron of vain regicide! Laugh'st thou at blasted hopes, whose vauntings lied? Beast, featured like the angels! can'st thou view This dome, outstretch'd by God's geometry, And doubt that Man may be sublime and true? Or, while the boy smiles upward from thy knee, Believe that slaves of slaves shall not be free?— How like meek Laud yon Cadi-Dervise scowls! A patent parson, made to please the squire! Priest, Judge, and Jury, for the cure of souls! Virtues like his no still small voice require; He cries his wares, and is himself the crier. No school is built, without his fulsome prayer, Which fulsome prints, with fulsome praise, record; No wretch is tried for want, but he is there In solemn session, sourest on the board, Where, like Saint Peter, he denies his lord. O, Cant and Cunning! mark the contrast well; The poor, damn'd here, are thankful, though they pine; Through foul and fair, they limp t'wards heav'n or hell; While he, (snug martyr,) when the day is fine, Seeks Abraham's bosom, and a Tory's wine. King of bad ale and hares! he shoots, and hunts; Then whips, or jails, the woe that cannot pay; Grants Lickgrub's license, and refuses Grunt's; Or fines poor Strap, who shaved on Sabbath day; And, like Saint Barebones, he detests a play. Thrice-loyal Jefferies! greet with shout and song The heir of all the Noodles of past years, Lord Robert Shallow! ready, rough, and wrong, He sheaths a world of wisdom in his ears, Yet seems no witch, and is what he appears. A sleepy watcher, he must feel to see, And, born to teach, may yet be taught to read; Bound by an accident, he hates the free; And, deaf and blind when Truth and Justice plead, Led by a shadow, seems to take the lead. How like a snake, all frozen but the fangs, His coldness threatens and his silence chills! How like a poisonous icicle he hangs O'er human hopes, and on the soul distils All mean, malignant, and infectious ills! The freezing cloud descends in snow or hail; The hill-born deluge floods the reedy fen; And shall not lords teach slaves, and Heav'n turn pale, And the grave shudder, at this crowded den Of wolves and worms?—O Nature, are they men? O Time, is this the island of the just And the immortal, in her virtues strong? The land of Shakspeare? Worthy of our dust, Because she guards the right, and loathes the wrong— The land of Ireton's bones, and Milton's song? Rise, Bard of our Republic!—wherefore rise, Like Samuel to the troubled King of old? Could'st thou flash living fire in Britons' eyes, Would pigmy souls be minds of giant mould? Oh, what could wake these worse than dead and cold? But thou, O Rock! that watchest freemen's graves! Well may'st thou veil thy lofty brow in shade, Scorning to look on boroughmongering knaves, And game-law'd, corn-law'd, war-worn, parish-paid, Rag-money'd, crawling wretches, reptile-flay'd!— What nameless curse comes next? Degraded Rome! How like a Cæsar of thy days of shame, He lolls behind his steeds, that ramp and foam Through crowds of slaves, with long submission tame, Hacks, not worth harness, void of tail and mane! All praise to him, to whom all praise is due! To him whose zeal is fire, whose rancour raves; Sworn anti-catholic, and tried true-blue; Champion of game-laws, and the trade in slaves; Mouth of the bread-tax; purchased tongue of knaves; All praise to him!—a menial yesterday, And now a kingling, served by hate and fear; The upstart buyer of yon ruins grey, That mock his tax-built pandemonium near! Clerk! Thief! Contractor! Boroughmonger! Peer! His mercy would be cruelty in hell; His actions say to God, ‘Submit to me!’ Dey of Starvation, dark and terrible! Men's purses may submit to thy decree, But why should conscience have no god but thee, Thou charioted blasphemer? Hence, away To Spain, or Naples, with thy loathsome scowl! Why stay'st thou here, to fuddle tax'd tokay? Go, be the Inquisition's holiest ghoul, And gorge with blood thy sulky paunch of soul!— But ye—poor Erin's cheerful exiles, born To till the flint in unrepining pain! Why bow ye to your foe, Hibernia's scorn? This almoner, whom treadmills might disdain? This pauper, worthier of the whip and chain? Fools! let accusing scorn, in each calm eye, Inform the tax-fed harpy and his hordes That wrongs have brought forth thoughts which cannot die; And that your wives have brought forth sons whose words Shall sting like serpents' teeth, and bite like swords. For what? Sad neighbour of the western star! Land of the daring deed and splendid song! For thee—whom worse than fiends, with worse than war Aping base Cromwell, and his tyrant throng, Torment for gold. Poor Land of deathless wrong! Scathed Eden of the vainly roaring deep! Are these thy gods?—the lowest of the low! Are these the wolves, who make thy millions weep? These lords of dungeons, partridge eggs, and woe, That think the lightning's ruinous wing too slow? But—Isle of Tears! Hispania of the sea! Mourner of ages, helpless in thy pain! Still untransform'd, blood-weeping Niobe! Mute, hopeless sufferer of the son-loved main— Whom e'en thy own Fitzwilliam cheer'd in vain— The dawn delay'd is nigh, the dismal morn, The day of grief, without remorse and shame, When of thy very famine shall be born A fiend, whose breath shall wither hope, like flame; Lean Retribution is his horrid name. Behold his bare and sinew'd haggardness! Behold his hide-bound arm, his fleshless thigh! 'Tis he! the fearless and the merciless! I see his cheek of bone, his lifeless eye, His frown—which speaks, and there is no reply! I hear his mutter'd scorn, his taunting strain: ‘Oppressor! hath thy bondage set us free? Is all thy long injustice worse than vain? Art thou, too, fall'n, scourged, trampled, weak as we? What! hath our destitution beggar'd thee? And can'st thou tell why plunder'd states are poor?’ II. The wild words ceased, and o'er the blasted moor Slow fled the form of that fierce regicide; While shriek'd beneath my feet the granite floor, From stream to headlong stream. But, eager-eyed, I gazed on stately shadows at my side; For buried kings, whose will, erewhile, was law, Around me, like the ghost of Hamlet, kept Their state majestic, arm'd! And when I saw Their cruel faces bathed in tears I wept. But o'er my heart a deadlier chillness crept; My white locks, every hair fear-stricken, stirr'd; My limbs, all shaken, trembled every bone; My pulse stood still! and in my soul I heard The torrent, tumbling o'er the cold, grey stone, Prophecy!—while the shadowy mountains lone, That saw the Roman eagle's wearied wing— Spake to the silence of the dead of old: ‘King of the Poor! thou wast, indeed, a king. But com'st thou sorrowing from the charnel cold? Henry Plantagenet, the uncontroll'd! Why? Did thy gracious servants bid thee reign O'er bread-tax'd vermin, and transform thy name Into a synonyme and type of pain, Written o'er famish'd realms in tears and flame? King of the People! royal is thy fame; Thou need'st not blush.’—‘First Edward! thou here, too? King of the Kingdom, hail! But on thy brow Why grows the saddening cloud? Is Peterloo A nobler word than Falkirk? or wast thou The nominee of kinglings, such as now Ordain what shall be best for states and thrones? Did men like them, when thou wast loved and fear'd, Glut death with blood, and cover earth with bones?’— ‘Third Edward! weepest thou? O prince revered! Lord of the lance, to chivalry endear'd! Still dost thou mourn the fall'n, the unrestored? And was Napoleon, with his burning brain Chain'd to the sunbeam, less to be deplored On his hard rock, amid the groaning main, Than captive John, with princes in his train, Served by mute kings and pensive victory? But thou art not that Edward who gave laws To wolfish anarchists. Thou less than he Who tamed the feudal beast, and pared his claws, And tore the venomous fangs from rabid jaws, And by and for the nation reign'd a king! Dost thou, too, weep thy country's failing weal? O doubt not that futurity will bring For her a purchaser! The North hath steel, The South hath gratitude; and slaves can feel— What can they feel? the rankling of their chain.’” III. Our souls are lyres, that strangely can retain The tones that trembled on their stricken chords; And these, impress'd upon my heart, remain: But the sad monarchs, leaning on their swords, Vanish'd in darkness, with the closing words, Like voiceless mists o'er ocean's sleepy waves. IV. What saw I next? A temple paved with graves! Lo! on the floor a giant corpse lay bare! And thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand slaves, All dead and ghastly, kneel'd for ever there, Statues of baseness, worshipping despair! From many a battle-field and many a sea, Cast forth by outraged earth and loathing tide, They made a winter for eternity, And seem'd like suppliant demons side by side, For in their looks their crimes were petrified. Bound by a spell, which ne'er, methought, would break; Amid the dead I stood, the living one! And, lo! the tears were froz'n on every cheek! Ah, ne'er in solitude felt I so lone, As in that crowd, whose tears were turn'd to stone! The Titan corpse, sublime in stillness lay, With marble looks, like power and pride asleep; O God! its dreadful silence could dismay More than the shriek of shipwreck o'er the deep! And every lifeless form did seem to weep, Gazing in trancèd horror and remorse, On the sad features of the mighty dead, While, on the forehead of that giant corpse, In letters of eternal fire, I read This sentence: “I am he for whom ye bled, Undying Death!—feast, Dogs, but lap no blood.” V. Then, lo! what, distant, seem'd the ocean's flood, Smote on my heart, with clamour fierce and foul. Wave shouldering wave, they shook me where I stood. No winds urged on the billowy, living roll, But whirlwind dwelt within it, like a soul, Heaving the foamy, roaring surges high, While all beside was voiceless, breathless fear; And, lo! the foam was human agony, Alive with curses, horrible to hear! The waves were men!—a deluge wide and drear! And while, all raving, all at once, they came, Heap'd on each other, to devour the shore, The flash of eyes made heav'n's red vengeance tame! The thunder dared not whisper to the roar; When, with their multitudinous hands, they tore The rocks, that seem'd to live in bestial forms. Lo! frozen there, the tiger's terror glared; Stiffen'd the startled folds of fangèd worms; Wolves grinn'd, like nightmare; glassy caymen stared; And the boar's tusk, his powerless tusk, was bared In fear—a tyrant's fear! High over head, The despot eagle ceased his prey to tear; His mighty pinions not for battle spread, But stretch'd to fly, and palsied by despair. Oh, what a hell of silent pangs was there, When, like an angel sweeping worlds away, Did that resistless sea of souls assail And crush his foes to dust, in dreadful play, Rending the monsters and their granite mail! Then all was hush'd! a sea without a sail! And, black with death, a strand of gory mud! VI. The vision changed; and, lo! methought I stood Where sinners swelter in the penal glare Of everlasting noon! A fiery flood, As of steel molten, on their nerves all bare, Rush'd from the brazen sky; and scorching air Burn'd upward from red rocks of solid fire. There I beheld a statesman, evil-famed, With unremitting and intense desire To quench immitigable thirst inflamed; Stretch'd, moaning, on the cinderous marl; and named, In scorn and rage, by spectres pitiless, Who bade him, smiting their clench'd hands, restore Their homes, their innocence, their happiness; And, in dire mockery, to his hot lips bore Rags, steep'd in black, thick, slippery, burning gore. But when he dozed, worn out with pain, he dream'd Of fire, and talk'd of fire that ever burn'd; And through his frame, in all his vitals gleam'd Fire; and his heart and brain, to cinder turn'd, Still crack'd and blazed, while, tossing, low he mourn'd, And from his eyes dropp'd tears of sable flame. For now no longer in his fraudful brain Schoon'd dreams of crime-bought good untinged with shame, False as the mists that loom along the main With shows of golden Ophir, sought in vain Where fiends of shipwreck watch their prey, and smile. VII. Yet seem'd he not the vilest of the vile. An apparition cold of life in stone, Or life in ice, drew nigh, with lips of bile; A visage to the awed spectators known, That turn'd to frigid rancour, like his own, Their fiery hatred. Frozen where they stood, Chain'd by his smile petrific, and his eye Whose serpent keenness sadden'd while it blazed— “Make way!” they yell'd, “the fatal fool draws nigh; The dog of kings, their whip for poverty, Seeks here the luxury of infernal tears.” Then shriek'd the prostrate wretch, as black he rose— “Even here Democracy his standard rears! Save me, my Brother, from unutter'd woes, Worse even than Paine deserved or Ireland knows!” “Thee? Aspect mean!” replied the new-arrived, “Thee? And am I thy brother? Lo, on thee I look with scorn—Driv'ler! whose fears contrived To thrall arm'd kings, whom I was born to free. And dost thou claim fraternity with me? I blew not up a spark into a flame That set the earth on fire: I drove no trade In petty retail havoc: No! I came, I saw, I conquer'd; and a world dismay'd Found safety in my daring, that array'd Slaves, who in freedom's fight like freemen fought, And still are slaves.” Then, turning to the crowd Of silent spectres—who regarded nought But him, such awe controll'd them—he, with proud Scorn, read their abject fear, and cried aloud— “Hence, vile Plebeians! know your lord.” And well The abject ghosts obey'd; for, while he spoke, He raised his hand to strike; but, ere it fell, Approaching sounds, that in the distance broke Murmuring, arrested the descending stroke. As, when black midnight melts from sky to sky, And shriek the lightnings at the wrath of heav'n, Air becomes fire, and, like a sea on high, Wide whirlwind rolls his deluge, sear'd and riv'n, While, with closed eyes, guilt prays to be forgiv'n, So, sight shrank, conquer'd, from his visage frore, That mock'd insulted fire with icy glare, While seem'd the torrid clime to burn the more As if incensed, and sounds swell'd on the air Which told of foes that knew not how to spare. Soon, spectre skeletons, like wolves in chase, Came howling on. As outstretch'd greyhounds fleet, Some with riv'n ribs, and one with half a face, They came, all hungry, and their clattering feet Stamp'd on the soil of adamantine heat. Then sprang they on him, and his muscles rent With cranching teeth; and still their hate increased As fast it fed, and joyful sounds forth sent; Yet from the rapturous banquet oft they ceased, Exclaiming, in the pauses of the feast, “Ice-hearted Dog!—when fell the crimson dew At Wexford, there we died!—In dungeons we! We of slow famine!—We at Peterloo! We, by the mercy of the scourge set free!” Unvanquish'd by relentless torture, he, While crisp'd in fire his cold flesh, scorch'd and torn, Forgot not, though he wept, the bearing high And proud demeanour of a tyrant born, But cried, uplooking to the hopeless sky— “Thou, who inhabitest eternity! Here, too, thy frown is felt, thy mercy just.” But when those skinless dogs of hell had pared The bones of their oppressor, and, with gust Infernal, crunch'd his vitals, till the bared, Cold, burning heart, with pulses unimpair'd, Shone in its grated chamber, like a light That saddens some snaked cavern's solitude; Then, pangs of deathless hunger in their might, Wrung savage howlings from his soul subdued; And, thenceforth and for ever, he pursued, Heading that dismal pack, the sentenced dead, For food, for food! hunter of souls! with yell Immortal, hounding on his fiends, while fled Their prey, far shrieking through unbounded hell. In ravenous ardour, sateless, horrible, He champ'd together still his stony jaws. O could the living heirs of fear and hate See the lost trampler on eternal laws, Taught by his voice of mourning, ere too late, How would they shun his crimes to shun his fate, And, e'en for mean self-love, be less than fiends!

Ezra White unroofs the Cottage of Hannah Wray, the Widow of an imputed Poacher—He detects her and her Daughter in the Act of re-roofing their Cottage—He assaults the Mother, and is killed by the Daughter—Imprisonment, Trial, and Death of Hannah Wray. I. Kind souls! ye jail the peasant, while ye plough The wild that loved to laugh around his home. Where the broad common fed his father's cow, And where himself, a fearless boy, could roam Unquestion'd, lo! the infant rivers foam No longer, through a paradise of fern! Look how, like burden'd slaves, they steal through fields That sullenly obey your mandate stern! And how the tortured waste, reluctant, yields Corn bought with souls, while soulless avarice builds His palace, rafter'd with iniquity! II. Storm-smitten rock! and thou, time-wrinkled tree! Where is the sun-loved cottage that of old Ye screen'd from envious winds? And where is he Who dwelt in that lone cottage of the wold? Far from the mountain bee he slumbers cold. Thou, Enoch Wray, shalt hear the son no more Who kill'd the harmless hare that ate his kale: Atrocious crime! for which he sternly bore Slow pain and wasting fever, in a jail. He perish'd there. Then died his widow pale, Who sleeps unsepulchred, and yet sleeps well. But silly Jane, their child, still wanders here, Seeking her mother on the stormy fell. While freezes as it flows the scalding tear, She lifts her left hand to her heart in fear, And waves a fan of bracken in the right, Forbidding evil sprites to melt the snow That veils the fields once till'd by Ezra White. Hark! how she grinds her teeth, and mutters low, With black lips quivering — “God, let nothing grow!” For Ezra White unroof'd their humble home, And thrust them forth, and mock'd the mother's woe, Bidding her, with her brat, a beggar roam, Or hire a hearth of him who feeds the crow, Or to the Workhouse, hope-abandon'd, go. “I to the Workhouse?—I?” the widow cried, And from her shoulders ript the kerchief thin, Displaying to the tyrant, elder-eyed, A breast that might have tempted saints to sin, While all th' impassion'd woman raged within— “I to the Workhouse?” and her forehead burn'd, And swell'd the tortured heart that would not break; And her neck thicken'd, and her visage turn'd Black, and she gasped, long impotent to speak: “I!—to the Workhouse? Rather will I seek The welcome grave. But hope not thou to thrive! Though, feeding on old crimes, and plotting new, Thou yet may'st crawl, the meanest thing alive; Here and hereafter thou shalt have thy due, And this vile deed with snakes shall whip thee, Jew! Am I thy tenant?—did I bid thee pay The Squire my rent?—and are three pounds eleven? Thou tyrant!—yet shall come thine evil day; Yet shalt thou find there is a God in heav'n, Although thy two fat farms have swallow'd seven. God! see this glutton! how he crams and grasps, Like death, for more—a beast of pray'r and prey. Would all their maws were stuff'd with stings of wasps! When shall I see them, on the bare highway Toil, like their betters, for a groat a-day? God! let him sow in vain! let nothing grow! Be straw his harvest, grainless chaff his food! To-morrow he will marry wealth and woe; (Ah, Lucy Hargrove is for him too good!) But may a mother's curse be on his blood! May he die childless!” And she turn'd, and bent, In passionate fondness, o'er her idiot child, Weeping; then took her hand in haste, and went, She cared not whither, uttering curses wild; But paused, and groan'd, while Jane look'd up and smiled, When Ezra's parting sneer shot through her brain. III. Morn rose, all splendid, o'er the frosty plain, And Lucy Hargrove married Ezra White. But Ezra strove to cheer his bride in vain; Long stay'd the day, and linger'd long the night; For Hannah's curse was on them like a blight. The homeless widow seem'd to haunt their bed— The idiot child to thunder at the door. “They fire the stacks,” he growl'd; “I hear their tread.” “O give them back their cottage on the moor; How canst thou prosper if thou rob the poor?” Cold lay the moonbeam on the glittering rock, When Ezra gruffly left his troubled bride; His early steps alarm'd the wondering cock; And the fox saw him on the dim hill side, Plodding through molten snow, with cautious stride And horrid instinct, hither. But, behold! Here laboured Hannah Wray, and silly Jane, Fearless of blinding sleet, and blue with cold, Busily roofing their sad cot again. Flash'd Ezra's eyes, and rage fired every vein, As when men wound a tiger. On he sprung, And grasp'd the struggling widow by the throat, Till white her eyes upturn'd, and forth her tongue Protruded through retracting lips that caught Sad hues from coming death, while anguish wrought Terrific changes on her pensive cheek. But Jane took up a stone, and smote his brow. He fell, but held his prey; with strangled shriek, He tried to heave his bulk, relaxing slow His murderous gripe, and backward sank; then low Dropp'd his large chin, and grim he gaped in death! But long lay Hannah senseless—happy she, If, senseless, she had yielded up her breath. But her eyes closed, then open'd—what to see? She gazed on Ezra's corpse in agony; Then on her daughter; and then gush'd her tears. The horrid future on her spirit gleam'd; She trembled with unutterable fears; And, while the wan dawn o'er the mountains beam'd, She clasp'd her daughter to her breast and scream'd— “No, I can die! they shall not hang my child!” Then came the hue and cry; the parting wild Of sunder'd bosoms, ne'er again to meet; The dungeon'd weeks; and hope, that never smiled. Yet once, in slumber, came a vision sweet, Which bore her spirit to the dear retreat Where still, she thought, her husband dwelt, and Jane Still press'd the nipple, pillow'd on her breast; The grave had lost its prey; the past its pain; The dead had never died! But thoughts so bless'd Could not endure. A darker dream oppress'd The dosing captive. Not to see her die, But dead, she thought, her child arrived, at last; She saw herself a corpse; saw Jane draw nigh Shrieking, to gaze upon that corpse, aghast; And, shrieking, waked, with temples throbbing fast! Then came the trial brief; the evidence So clear, so false, so fatal; the sad eyes, All gazing on convicted innocence, But not in pity! her convulsive sighs, Her sudden tears; the dread solemnities Of sentence on the wrong'd and guiltless!—Oh, Was there no pleader, by the laws allowed, To aid the sufferer in her hour of woe? No—not a voice in all that awe-struck crowd Was raised for her whom fate had stunn'd and bow'd; For her, who then must plead, or ne'er again. Dreadful, O Death, are all thy paths of pain! And many a wretch hath felt, but who shall tell What pangs unnamed the convict must sustain, Ere frailty, pale as snow, bids hope farewell, And, for the living, tolls the passing bell? Still, in her desolation, nightly she Dream'd that the Lord had heard her earnest prayer; Her child, she thought, poor Jane, was come to see Her mother die, and beg a lock of hair, Which she might kiss in tears and ever wear. Dark roll'd the hours by cruel mercy given, The waking hours of certainty and doom; And, in her cell, she cried to earth and heav'n, “O let my child sleep with me in the tomb! Tomb! I shall have none!” And the echoing gloom Mutter'd, even when she slept, her heavy sigh. IV. As if no heart had ever ached, no eye Shed bitter tears, another morn arose, All light and smiles; but, with the brightening sky, Hannah awoke from dreams of death, to close Her eyes in dreamless and profound repose. But Jane came not! poor Jane was far away; She, though oft told, knew not her mother's doom; But much she wonder'd at her lengthen'd stay, With saddening thoughts, and cheek that lost its bloom. Hark! the bell tolls! and yet Jane is not come! “But she, who murder'd pious Ezra White, And trampled on his brains,” (so rumour lies,) Ere minutes pass, must wrestle with the might That none can vanquish. Lo! ten thousand eyes Are gazing on the prison where she sighs! The streets are paved, the house-tops piled with heads, The windows choak'd with faces, anxious all To look on all that man most hates and dreads. Now the hush deepens near the fetter'd wall; Now a dropp'd feather might be heard to fall; Now, by the scaffold, hearts throb quick and loud; Now, in dire stillness, hark, faint murmurs rise! And, lo! the murderess bends above the crowd, Bursting, with desperate strength, the cord that ties Her arms, and rolling on all sides her eyes! Chill'd, in a moment, chill'd is every heart. “Where is my child?” she sobs; “My child!” she shrieks; “O let me see my child, ere I depart!” And long, for her who is not here, she seeks; Then, to the crowd, with hands uplifted, speaks: “Ye come to see a murderess? I am none. A stainless conscience is my rock and tower. 'Tis true my foe to his account is gone; But not for all this world's vain pomp and power Would I have shorten'd his bad life an hour. I die his victim, and die reconciled. Kind hearts! ye melt—but which of ye will bear A dying mother's keepsake to her child? O for a kindred heart, my grief to share; A kindred voice, to join my parting prayer!” Lo! as she ended, on her bosom bent A blind old pilgrim, who had left the throng Weeping aloud, all pitied as he went! She clasp'd him with a grasp convulsed and strong— She kiss'd him fervently, and held him long. “God bless thee, Enoch, for this last good deed!” She sobb'd—and down her cheeks the tears gush'd free. “But we must bear whatever is decreed. Nay, father of my Joe, be firm, like me! Hold up! be firm, as innocence should be! Guiltless I go to join thy son in heaven. Jane, too, is guiltless, though she kill'd our foe, Who, when he died, had need to be forgiv'n.— Bear to my child this tress; a month ago 'Twas raven black, and now 'tis white as snow. Yes, Enoch, I am guiltless. Let them pare My bones, and make a mockery of my frame; They cannot stain my soul! and I can bear What must be borne. Why, then, should my sad name, Whenever utter'd, flush thy cheek with shame? Poor Enoch! where thy murder'd son lies low, I hoped to weep again; but hope deceives! O might I rest with him!—no flower will blow O'er me, no redbreast cover me with leaves! This thought, despite my will, appals and grieves My conquering soul, ere it take wing and soar. Should one or two remember me in love, Say I died guiltless.—Though we meet no more On earth, an angel waits for us above; But thou shalt nurse awhile my orphan dove, Far from the parent bird—when I am free!” V. And all is o'er—the shock, the agony, The low-breathed moan of sympathetic woe. But silly Jane, still wandering gloomily, Wears on her breast the lessening lock of snow; And still she mutters, “God! let nothing grow: God! may a mother's curse be on their blood!” BOOK IX. CONTENTS. Secret Sorrow and Illness of Enoch Wray—He takes leave of Objects associated in his Mind with the Past. I. Why is our father's look so full of pain? What silent malady, what secret woe, Weighs on his gloomy heart and dizzy brain? An evil which he seeks, yet dreads to know, Not yet assured, suspected long ago. Hath the dark angel of the night, that still Delights in human agony and tears, Appall'd his slumbers with predicted ill, And confirmation of his worst of fears? The cause I tell not, but th' effect appears In sudden alteration, such as oft Comes on the unailing agèd, when they seem Strong as old eagles on the wing aloft. Swift was the change and ghastly, as the gleam Of baleful meteors on a midnight stream, Blighting the waters. His Herculean frame Stood, in the winds of March, erect and bold; But when the cowslip—like a living flame Kindled in April—burn'd its incense cold, He seem'd the shadow of himself, and roll'd, With a strange keenness, his benighted eyes. II. Bright shines the ice o'er which the skater flies, Roofing the waters with transparent stone, Firm as the rock, when umber'd evening dies, But when the cloudy morn arises—gone. So perish human glories, every one. Oh, ne'er again, ye misty mountains dim! When the frost parcheth on your sides the heath, Shall its shrill histie whistle welcome him Who once could see the tempest toss beneath Your solemn brows, and to the vales bequeath The volley'd hail, from clouds of every hue. III. The meanest thing to which we bid adieu, Loses its meanness in the parting hour. When long-neglected worth seems born anew, The heart that scorns earth's pageantry and power May melt in tears, or break, to quit a flower. Thus, Enoch—like a wretch prepared to fly, And doom'd to journey far, and come no more— Seeks old acquaintance with a boding sigh. Lo! how he weeps for all he loved of yore, Telling to weeds and stones quaint stories o'er! How heavily he climbs the ancient stile, Whence, on the hill which he no more shall climb, Not with a brief, albeit a mournful smile, He seems to gaze, in reverie sublime, Till heard afar and saddening all the clime, Slow swings from yonder tower the passing bell! IV. There is a flower—the housewife knows it well— A flower, which long hath graced the warm hedge side Of Enoch's dying neighbour, Andrew Gell; Whose spleeny sire he pummell'd for his pride, Ere beauteous Mary Gold became a bride. It is the flower which (pious rustics say) The virgin-mother on her bosom wore. It hoards no dew-drop, like the cups of May, But, rich as sunset, when the rain is o'er, Spreads flamy petal from a burning core; Which, if morn weep, their sorrowing beams upfold, To wake and brighten, when bright noon is near. And Enoch bends him o'er the marigold; He loves the plant, because its name is dear. But on the pale green stalks no flowers appear, Albeit the future disc is growing fast. He feels each little bud with pleasing pain, And sighs in sweet communion with the past; But never to his lip, or burning brain, The flower's cold softness shall he press again, Murmuring his long-lost Mary's virgin name. V. Deep in the vale, where, known to humble fame, Poor Enoch's rival in immortal verse, The Village Poet, lives—well skill'd to frame The beauteous slipper, and the sonnet terse, Wise to compose, and willing to rehearse; A kind good man, who knows our father's worth, And owns his skill in everything but rhyme; Sage, too, and meek, as any wight on earth, Save that he laughs at transitory time, And deems his own a deathless name sublime;— There, by the brook, cowers a low edifice, With honeysuckled wall, and ivied roof, A warm safe nest, in which two mortal mice Might slumber through existence, far aloof From city folks, whose sickly looks give proof That, whatsoe'er is theirs, thou, Health, art not. A dial, by our skilful father made, Instructs the inmates of that little cot; The masterpiece, which first his skill display'd, When all to him their wondering homage paid. Lo! on a visit, mournfully he wends, To feel the dial, his acquaintance old; But, by the way, in pensive musing bends O'er ancient landmark, now half sunk in mould: Shake hands, sad friends, for times are changed and cold! But, lo! he enters at the garden gate! Awhile in chat the rival poets stand: He feels the bench, where oft in youth he sate; The shed, which, long ago, he built and plann'd; And now the dial is beneath his hand. Ah, the slow shadow, measuring the swift hours, While his touch wanders o'er the figured plane, Baffles his patient finger's cunning powers! But man, the shadow, mocks grey Time in vain! Dusky, we pass away; he laughs amain; His sportive trade it is to mow us down; He plays at death, and is industrious too! Thou dark and sorrowing mortal, yet unmown, Weep—but thy sun-clock, as of old, is true! Oh, better weep than do as others do, Whose eyes discredit all save what they see! But thou deny'st not beauty, colour, light; Full well thou know'st, that, all unseen by thee, The Vernal Spirit, in the valleys bright, Is scattering diamonds over blossoms white. She, though she deign to walk, hath wings of gold And plumes all beauteous; while in leafing bower, The chrysalis, that ne'er did wing behold, Though born to glide in air o'er fruit and flower, Disproves the plume, the beauty, and the power, And deems it quite impossible to fly. VI. Farewell ye mountains, neighbours of the sky! Enoch will tread your silky moss no more; But here he breathes your freshness. Art thou nigh, Grey moth of April? On the reedy shore, For the last time he hears thee, circling o'er The starry flower. Broad poplar, soon in bloom, He listens to thy blossomy voice again, And feels that it is vernal! but the tomb Awaits him, and thy next year's flow'rs, in vain, Will hearken for his footsteps. Shady lane, Where Fearn, the bloody, felt his deadly arm! Gate, which he climb'd, to cut his bow of yew From the dark tree of ages! Upland farm, His uncle's once! thou furzy bank, whose hue Is of the quenchless fire! adieu, adieu, For ever! Thy soft answer to the breeze, Storm-strengthen'd sycamore! is music yet To his tired spirit: here, thou King of Trees, His own hand did thine infant weakness set; But thou shalt wear thy palmy coronet Long, long, when he is clay. Lake of the Mill, That murmurest of the days when vigour strung His oary feet, farewell! He hears thee still, And in his heart beholds thy banks, o'erhung By every tree thou knew'st when he was young! Forge!—built by him, against the ash-crown'd rock, And now with ivy grown, a tussock'd mound— Where oft himself, beneath the hammer's shock Drew forth the welded steel, bright, blue, and sound! Vale of the stream-loved abbey, woodland-bound! Thou forest of the Druids! O thou stone, That once wast worshipp'd!—pillar of the past, On which he lean'd amid the waste alone! Scorner of change! thou listenest to the blast Unmoved as death; but Enoch travels fast. Thatch'd alehouse, still yclept the Sickles cross'd! Where died his club of poverty and age— Worst blow of all! where oft the blacksmith toss'd His truth-deciding coin; and, red with rage, The never-silenced barber wont engage In argument with Enoch! Fountain dim, In which his boyhood quench'd the sultry beam! School, where crown'd monarchs might have learn'd of him Who sway'd it, how to reign! Cloud-cradled stream, That in his soul art eloquent as a dream! Path-pencill'd hill, now clad in broomy light! Where oft in youth he waked the violets cold, When you, love-listening stars, confess'd the might Of earthly beauty, and o'er Mary Gold Redden'd with passion, while his tale he told! Rose, yet unblown! thou future woodbine flower! Majestic foxglove, still to summer true! Blush of the hawthorn! glad May's sunny shower! Scenes long beloved, and objects dear, adieu! From you, from earth, grey Enoch turns his view; He longs to pass away, and soon will pass. But not with him will toil and sorrow go! Men drop, like leaves—they wither, and, alas! Are seen no more! but human toil and woe Are lasting as the hills, or ocean's flow, Older than Death, and but with Death will die. VII. Ye sister trees, with branches old and dry! Tower'd ye not huge as now, when Enoch Wray, A happy lad, pursued the butterfly O'er broomy banks, above the torrent's spray, Whence still ye cast the shadow of your sway? Lo—Grey-hair'd Oaks, that sternly execrate The poor man's foes, albeit in murmurs low! Or, with a stormy voice, like that of fate, Smiting your wrinkled hands, in wrath and woe, Say to th' avenging lightnings, “Why so slow?” Lo! that glad boy is now a man of pain! Once more he totters through the vernal fields; Once more he hears the corncrake on the plain; The vale invites him, where the goldring builds, And the wild bank that primrose fragrance yields; He cannot die, without a sad adieu To one sweet scene that to his heart is dear; Yet—would he dream his fears may not be true, And miss a draught of bitterest sorrow here— His feet will shun the mill-dam, and the weir O'er which the stream its idle brawling sends. VIII. But, lo! t'wards Albert's mill the Patriarch wends! (His own hands rear'd the pile: the very wheels Were made by him; and where the archway bends, His name, in letters of hard stone, appeals To time and memory.) With mute step, he steals Along the vale, but does not hear the mill! 'Tis long since he was there. Alas! the wave Runs all to waste, the mighty wheel is still! Poor Enoch feels as if become a slave; And o'er his heart the long grass of the grave Already trembles! To his stealthy foot, Around the door thick springs the chance-sown oat. While prune their plumes the water-hen and coot, Fearless and fierce the rat and otter float, Catching the trout in Albert's half-sunk boat: And, pendent from each bucket, fat weeds dip Their slimy verdure in the listless stream. “Albert is ruin'd, then!” his quivering lip Mutters in anguish, while with paler beam His sad eye glistens. “'Tis, alas, no dream! Heav'n save the blood of Enoch Wray from shame! Shame undeserved, the treadmill of the soul!” Thus Enoch mutely prays, but does not blame Albert, who could not, well he knows, control The fate that hurl'd him down to fortunes foul. Triumphant Science! what avail thy deeds, Thy sailless navy, and thy steam-drawn car, If growing power to deeper misery leads? If weeds and worms thy tenfold harvest mar? And all thy fruits but fatten waste and war? England is changed since Enoch was a lad. Grubs dream'd not then that earth for them was made; Men did not sweat to bloat the weak and bad, In hopeless sorrow faithful though betray'd; Nor was toil famine; nor was gambling trade. Albert is strong, laborious, frugal, just; But danger lurk'd where safety seem'd to be, And cloudless thunder turn'd his hopes to dust. While navies sank on fortune's sunny sea, Unskill'd to save his little bark was he. In dreadful calm, the viewless storm increased; Most fatal, when least dreaded, came the blow That still was nearest when expected least; And none who felt the stroke could see the foe; But all was wondering fear and helpless woe. The servant took the master by the nose; The beggar'd master slunk aside to die; Down dropp'd the cobweb Crœsus, stunn'd; he rose, And fell again, he knew not how or why. Like frost and thaw in April's fickle sky, The wretched rich, and not less wretched poor, Changed places miserably; and the bad Throve, while the righteous begg'd from door to door: None smiled, save knaves; but loudly laugh'd the mad, Even at their prayers, and then they kick'd the sad. And still men fought with shadows, and were slain. For ruin smote, nor warning gave at all— Unseen, like pestilence, and fear'd in vain! But when red battle wings the whirling ball, The cannon flashes ere the victims fall, Loud bursts the roar, and then is heard the groan. IX What is this plague, unsearchable and lone, Sightless and tongueless, till a wild voice howls When nations die? What is this power unknown? And whence this strange simoom that withers souls? O ask the empire-swallowing deep, that rolls Black o'er lost wealth and long-forgotten fame! X. Shall I, lost Britain! give the pest a name That, like a cancer, eats into thy core? 'Tis Avarice, hungry as devouring flame; But, swallowing all, it hungers as before, While flame, its food exhausted, burns no more. O ye hard hearts that grind the poor, and crush Their honest pride, and drink their blood in wine, And eat their children's bread without a blush, Willing to wallow in your pomp, like swine, Why do ye wear the human form divine? Can ye make men of brutes, contemn'd, enslaved? Can ye grow sweetness on the bitter rue? Can ye restore the health of minds depraved? And self-esteem in blighted hearts renew? Why should souls die to feed such worms as you? Numidian! who didst say to hated Rome— “There is no buyer yet to purchase thee!” Come, from the damn'd of old, Jugurtha, come! See one Rome fall'n!—another, mightier, see! And tell us what the second Rome shall be! But long, O Heav'n! avert from this sad land The conflict of the many with the few, When, crumpled, like a leaf, in havock's hand, The great, the old, shall vanish from the view, And slaves be men, all traitors, and all true! Nor from the fierce and iron-breathing North, That grimly blosoms with the sword and spear, Call a new Alaric and his robbers forth, To crush what worth is left untrampled here, And shake from Freedom's urn dust still too dear, While trade-left Thames pours mute his shipless wave! But thou, our Father, journeyest to the grave, A Briton, like thy sires, the fear'd of old! Thou shalt not see outlandish king or slave Conquer the green isle of the stern and bold, That despots, erst, though leagued with hell, controll'd. The land where Hampden fell and Russell bled, Is yet no barrack for invading hordes; Mary is undefiled, her boy unled To slaughter, by their country's foreign lords. Yet hast thou seen our fratricidal swords Assail the bondsmen, struggling to be free; And strike for tyrants, destined, soon or late, To thank our crimes, by which they reign, and be Black vengeance to our hearths, and righteous fate. But go!—no second spring can renovate Thy blighted soul. A moment, big with woe, O'er thee hath roll'd another hundred years. Go, to the cottage of thy childhood, go! Where green, as in thy youth, the vale appears, And Mary's love awaits her sire, in tears. Go to thy cottage—not with humbled look And stealthy pace, a thing of guilt and fear! But thou, alas, dependence canst not brook! E'en pity now is insult to thine ear; Fall'n is thy crest, thy heart is cold and drear. Yet go thou to thy home, though daily there Some little comfort is retrench'd; nor blame The child, who veil'd her griefs her sire to spare. “Though Mary is become an ill-starr'd name, Why should her father feel the pang of shame?” How often from thy side doth she retire To weep alone! “Shall he who gave us all— Shall Enoch Wray, the soul of fearless fire, The good, the proud, become in age a thrall?” Oh, not for this the lord of shroud and pall So long hath pass'd him on his gloomy way! No; he who hears the voiceless worm complain Hath heard his spirit for dismission pray: “O, let me, Lord, my God, till death, retain My humble pride, a name without a stain! When the flesh fail'd not, Lord, I lean'd on Thee! Though the flesh fails, let not my soul be moved! But now release me, if thy will it be— O let thy child rejoin the lost and loved! For long on earth have I thy mercy proved, And my heart yearns to bless thy name in heav'n.” BOOK X. CONTENTS. Horrors of Paupery to Independent Minds—Enoch Wray visits the Churchyard, where he reads the Grave-Stones with his Fingers —Death of the Patriarch. I. Life! who would live, to be the helpless prey Of sordid avarice? O neglected Age, That, bedrid, lingerest in prolong'd decay! Who would, like thee, a war all hopeless wage With foes that mock his grief and scorn his rage? How sad the sight, when, far from all he loves, By crowds pursued, the slander'd terrier flies, Till, wounded by his lord in unknown groves, He mingles looks of love with piteous cries, And, smiling on his dear destroyer, dies! How terrible, to wake, interr'd alive, And shriek for instant aid, which cannot come; And scare the worm, that yet shall feed; and strive, Beneath relentless earth, in airless gloom, With desperate wrench, to dispossess the tomb! More dreaded still, lost Captive, is thy fate, To whom a grave is given, and death denied, For life entomb'd by unforgiving hate, Who bids despair, thy chamberlain, provide Hope's coffin'd corpse, to mate thy sleepless side! But direr, sadder than all these, is man Wasted by want and superhuman toil; Or fall'n from decent competence, and wan With grief, and forced, while heart and brain recoil, To beg a crust on his paternal soil, Or ask his equals for a pauper's pay. II. But thou art not a pauper, Enoch Wray! Free hast thou lived, in honesty and pride, A hundred summers; bright hath been thy day, Even in its gloom; and on the grave's dark side Thou little hast to fear, and nought to hide— Prepared to die, as good men wish to die. III. Hark!—like a spirit preaching from the sky, “Repent ye, for the kingdom is at hand!” An iron voice—as if Eternity, Dethroning Time, sent forth his high command— Speaks to the awed heart of the silent land. From yonder tower, time-darken'd, thunder-scarr'd, Still the deep toll is floating on the air; It calls our father to the lone churchyard; Ah, many, many of his friends are there! And Age, at five-score years, hath few to spare! Thou antique Fane! that, in thy solemn suit Of carven flowers, and stone-embroidery grand, (Old, yet unshaken; eloquent, though mute,) Tower'st like the sculptured guardian of the land! Thy reverend looks what bosom can withstand, And feel nor throb like love, nor chill like fear, Nor glow like adoration? The leaves fall Around thee—men fall with them; both are here; While thou alike view'st bridal-robe and pall, Sovereign of marriage and of funeral! Witness of Ages, and memorial hoar Of generations, to eternity Gone, like the hour that can return no more! Grey Enoch is a child compared with thee; Yet man like him thou ne'er again shalt see! How would it gladden thy bewilder'd eyes, (Duskèd with cobweb films, and colours old, And with long gazing on dim blazonries,) Could'st thou, in these degenerate times, behold A pair like Enoch Wray and Mary Gold, As to the altar, in their youth, they came; He, like a warrior to the battle feast, With cheek of downy light and umber'd flame, A presence glorious as the bright'ning east; She, bending at his side, with charms increased, Like chaste Andromache by Hector led; Her arm in his, her gentle eyes depress'd, Her neck and face with burning crimson spread, And lovely as maternal beauty's breast, Beneath the soft cheek of her child caress'd, Returning love for love and smile for smile! But, oh, not now, thou venerable pile! Comes he, with genial thoughts to rapture true, But with sad heart, though not without a smile, To bid his old remembrances adieu; And, ere he mingle with the clay, renew Feelings, which, when the dust that moulders here, Could sympathize with animated clay, Joy'd with its joy, return'd it tear for tear, And, bidding sorrow look for brighter day, Pointed to heav'n, but did not “lead the way.” Now on the tombstones, which of old he laid, (Pages with silent admonition fraught,) He kneels; and, in the twilight of thy shade, Reads, with his fingers, what his chisel wrought; Perchance th' effusions of his pensive thought, Full oft recited in his soul with pride. IV. Erect, like youth, stands this sepulchral stone: But what is youth? a flower; and life? a dream. Read!—for youth, life, the flower, the dream, are gone: Read!—“Death is life! I am not what I seem: Think of poor Henry still! but rightly deem.” V. The next is dateless; but, aged eighteen years, Died she, whom hardest hearts have ceased to blame; The kind still read her epitaph with tears:— “Here rests a stranger—she had once a name: Weep for the gentle dust that died of shame.” VI. They did not lay his bones where four roads meet. Although his crime was grief, which some called pride, Wrong not the wrong'd, who slumbers at thy feet! “Was Jones a coward? Honest, yet belied, He was too brave to live disgraced, and died.” VII. In yonder grave heaven's grateful debtor lies, Struck blind in youth—old Shiloh Hollischart. “The beam of beauty left his cheerful eyes, To glow more deeply, brightly, in his heart.” Read, mortal! be instructed, and depart. VIII. “Tears for the slander'd! tears—but shed too late. Come! if thou come to weep, traducer fell, Whose slighted love hath done the work of hate! But thou, perchance, hast yet more lies to tell Of her who loved but thee, and loved too well?” IX. This still retreat, thou faithful to the dead, Claims thy attentive pause, demands thy tear! Stop! read again th' inscription, often read:— “Remember me; and, weeping, linger here, If still to thee thy Harcourt's name is dear! But, if thou wed again, O come not near!” X. A broken mast, a bursting wave, a child Weeping, a woman frantic on the shore— Rude stone! thou tell'st a story sad and wild:— “Pain, want, unkindness, all ‘afflictions sore,’ Disease, suspense, with constancy I bore; My heart was broken—Letty lies with me; And now we know that Matthew died at sea.” XI. No sculptured stone informs the passer by That the poor clown is now the Squireling's peer: Here lies a rogue, whose crime was poverty! And just Sir Cornlaw sleeps in marble near! Bones of the treadmill'd slave!—what do ye here? Oh, shame to bread-tax'd England's bought-and-sold! The loathsome wretch, who toil'd, and starved, and died, And he whose merit was a robber's gold, Repose, like married equals, side by side! Audacious Death, is Mammon thus defied? What, shall the parish-paid of yesterday Rest with the sacred boroughmongering great? Why fence ye not a pauper's Golgotha, Where, buried without bell, these dogs may wait The crowing cock, while rich men rot in state? XII. But to one grave the blind man's eyes are turn'd, Move where he may—and yet he seeks it not. He communes with the poor, the lost, the mourn'd, The buried long, by all but him forgot: The hated?—no; his bosom never burn'd With fire so base: the dreaded?—no; he spurn'd Fear, as unworthy of the human breast. Why does he pause on his dark pilgrimage? Hath he forgot what love remembers best? O stoop and find, in this familiar page, The mournful story, dearest to his age! “Here Lucy rests, who, in this vale of tears, Dwelt thirty weeks:—Here waits the judgment-day Her brother James, who died, aged fifty years: Here slumbers sinless Anne, who lived a day: Children of Mary and of Enoch Wray.” His finger pauses, like a trembling wand, Held o'er desponding hope by mercy. Lo! Another line, cut by another hand, On the cold stone, from which he riseth slow; But it is written on his heart of woe; “Mary! thou art not lost, but gone before.” XIII. Oh, no!—not lost. The hour that shall restore Thy faithful husband, Mary, is at hand; Ye soon shall meet again, to part no more; By angels welcomed to their blissful land, And wander there, like children, hand in hand, To pluck the daisy of eternal May. XIV. It is the evening of an April day. Lo! for the last time, in the cheerful sun Our father sits, stooping his tresses grey, To hear the stream, his ancient neighbour, run, Young as if time had yesterday begun. Heaven's gates are like an angel's wing, with plumes Of glorious green and purply gold on fire: Through rifts of mountainous clouds, the light illumes Hill-tops and woods, that, pilgrim-like, retire; And, like a giant's torch, burns Morthern spire. Primrosy odours, violet-mingled, float O'er blue-bells and ground-ivy, on their wings Bearing the music of the blackbird's note; Beneath the dewy cloud the woodlark sings, But on our father's heart no gladness flings. Mary bends o'er him, mute. Her youngest lad Grasps, with small hand, his grandsire's finger fast; Well knows the old man that the boy is sad; And the third Mary, as she hurries past, Trembles, and looks towards the town aghast. Enoch hears footsteps of unwelcome sound, While at his feet the sightless mastiff lies; And, lo! the blind dog, growling, spurns the ground! “Two strangers are approaching,” Enoch cries; But Mary's throbbing heart alone replies. A stern, “Good day, sir!” smites his cheek more pale; A rude collision shakes him in his chair; The Bible of his sires is mark'd for sale! But degradation is to him despair; The hour is come which Enoch cannot bear! But he can die!—and in his humble grave, Sweet shall his long rest be, by Mary's side; And o'er his coffin (uninscribed) shall wave The willow tree, beneath the dark tower's pride, Set by his own sad hand when Mary died. Though basely branded with a poacher's name, Poor Joseph slumbers in a distant tomb; Though Joseph's widow died a death of shame, Still there was mercy in the old man's doom! But now—dependence and disgrace are come! “Albert,” he sighs, “will perish by this blow.— Where is he?”—No reply.—“And shall the throng Of paupers see my daughter weekly go For parish alms? No, Heav'n! I yet am strong; Restore my sight! or I have lived too long.” The vain, vain wish, too mighty, leaves him faint; His visage wan assumes a darkening hue; The blind dog whines a melancholy plaint, And ghastly roll his eyes of pallid blue; E'en the hard bailiffs dread the scene to view. Lyre of the past! O, art thou, then, unstrung? The boy resigns his grandsire's finger cold; A sweet word lingers on our father's tongue— “Mary, dear Mary.”—But the tale is told: With her whose virgin name was Mary Gold, He hears, in heav'n, his swooning daughter shriek. And when the woodbine's cluster'd trumpet blows; And when the pink's melodious hues shall speak, In unison of sweetness with the rose, Joining the song of every bird that knows How sweet it is of wedded love to sing; And when the fells, fresh-bathed in azure air, Wide as the summer day's all golden wing, Shall blush to heav'n, that Nature is so fair, And man condemn'd to labour, in despair;— Then, the gay gnat, that sports its little hour; The falcon, wheeling from the ancient wood; The redbreast, fluttering o'er its fragrant bower; The yellow-bellied lizard of the flood; And dewy morn, and evening—in her hood Of crimson, fringed with lucid shadows grand— Shall miss the Patriarch; at his cottage door The bee shall seek to settle on his hand, But from the vacant bench haste to the moor, Mourning the last of England's high-soul'd poor, And bid the mountains weep for Enoch Wray! And for themselves!—albeit of things that last Unalter'd most; for they shall pass away Like Enoch, though their iron roots seem fast Bound to the eternal future, as the past! The Patriarch died! and they shall be no more. Yes, and the sailless worlds, which navigate Th' unutterable deep that hath no shore, Will lose their starry splendour, soon or late! Like tapers, quench'd by Him whose will is fate! Yes, and the Angel of Eternity, Who numbers worlds, and writes their names in light, Ere long, O Earth, will look in vain for thee, And start, and stop, in his unerring flight, And, with his wings of sorrow and affright, Veil his impassion'd brow and heav'nly tears! THE SPLENDID VILLAGE. IN TWO PARTS. To Colonel Thomas Peronnet Thompson, who, next after Bentham, has by his writings done more good for mankind than any other man since Adam Smith, this Poem is thankfully dedicated by his humble Pupil. Part I. THE WANDERER RETURNED. I. Yes, ye green hills that to my soul restore The verdure which in happier days it wore! And thou, glad stream, in whose deep waters laved Fathers, whose children were not then enslaved! Yes, I have roam'd where Freedom's spirit fires The stern descendants of self-exiled sires; Men who transcend the herd of human kind A foot in stature, half a man in mind. But tired, at length, I seek my native home, Resolved no more in gorgeous wilds to roam; Again I look on thee, thou loveliest stream! And, seeming poor, am richer than I seem. Too long in woods the forest-Arab ran, A lonely, mateless, childless, homeless man; Too long I paced the ocean and the wild— Clinging to Nature's breast, her petted child: But only plough'd the seas to sow the wind, And chased the sun to leave my soul behind. But when hot youth's and manhood's pulses cool'd, When pensive thought my failing spirit school'd— Lured by a vision which, where'er I rove, Still haunts me with the blush of earliest love— A vision, present still, by night, by day, Which not Niagara's roar could chase away— I left my palace, with its roof of sky, To look again on Hannah's face, and die, I saw, in thought, beyond the billow's roar, My mother's grave—and then my tears ran o'er! And then I wept for Hannah, wrong'd, yet true! I could not—no—my wasted life renew; But I could wiselier spend my wiser years, And mix a smile with sinking vigour's tears. II. Sweet Village! where my early days were pass'd! Though parted long, we meet—we meet at last! Like friends, embrown'd by many a sun and wind, Much changed in mien, but more in heart and mind. Fair, after many years, thy fields appear, With joy beheld, but not without a tear. I met thy little river miles before I saw again my natal cottage door; Unchanged as truth, the river welcomed home The wanderer of the sea's heart-breaking foam; But the changed cottage, like a time-tried friend, Smote on my heart-strings, at my journey's end. For now no lilies bloom the door beside: The very houseleek on the roof hath died; The window'd gable's ivy-bower is gone, The rose departed from the porch of stone; The pink, the violet, have fled away, The polyanthus, and auricula! And round my home, once bright with flowers, I found Not one square yard—one foot of garden ground. III. With gun in hand, and insolence of eye, A sun-burn'd menial, as I came, drew nigh; By might empower'd small felons to deter, Constable, publican, and warrener. He met me, muttering—“I should know this tramp;” He pass'd me, muttering “Vagabond” and “Scamp!” And, as a beadle eyes a thief, he cast A keen glance at the cottage, as he pass'd. My brother dwelt within. 'Tis true, he took My offer'd hand, but froze me with a look So trouble-worn and lost, so hard yet dull, That I shrank from him, though my heart was full; I sought society, but stood alone; I came to meet a man, and found a stone! His wife, in tatters, watch'd the fireless grate; Three boys sat near her, all in fierce debate, And all in rags—but one constructing snares, With which, at night, to choke Lord Borough's hares. My sister, Rose, had parish-pay, they said, And Ann was sent abroad, and Jane was dead; And these misfortunes laid my sire beside The mother, who in better days had died. Such welcome found the wanderer of the deep! I had no words—I sobb'd, but could not weep. IV. Well, here I am, resolved to view the land— Inquire and ponder—hear and understand. V. The cucking-stool is gone, the stocks remain— Why either or not both? Ye stocks, explain! Changed scene! Unchanged yon frosted tower remains; Beneath the hill, it peers o'er vales and plains; And, like a patriarch of the olden time, Sees age around, but none like his sublime. Ere yon huge house, with jail-like frown, displaced The wild brier roses of the thymy waste, There, near the church, the stocks, and cucking-stool, Abode the sovereign of the village school. A half-faced man, too timid for his trade, And paid as timid men are ever paid; He taught twelve pupils for six pounds a-year, Made a consumption, and was buried here. None said of him, he reap'd the crop he grew, And lived by teaching what he never knew. His school is gone—but still we have a school, Kept by an ignoramus—not a fool; For o'er his mansion, written large, we see “Mister John Suckemwell's Academy;” A boarding-school, where gentlemen are taught To write fine copies, which the teacher wrote! Behold the usher!—I behold and start! For in his face I read a broken heart. Servant of servants! brow-beat by a knave! Why for a coffin labour like a slave? Better break granite on the King's highway Than earn, with Porson's powers, a pauper's pay! Why die to live? I know a wiser plan— An easier too—black shoes, and be a man! VI. Village! thy butcher's son, the steward now, Still bears the butcher on his burly brow. Oft with his sire he deigns to ride and stare; And who like them, at market or at fair? King of the Inn, he takes the highest place, And carves the goose, and grimly growls the grace. There, in the loud debate, with might—with might— Still speaks he last, and conquers still the right; Red as a lobster, vicious as his horse, That, like its master, worships fraud and force; And, if the stranger 'scape its kick or bite, Lowers its vex'd ears, and screams for very spite. “He hath enough, thank God, to wear and eat; He gives no alms”—not e'en his putrid meat; “But keeps his cab, whips beggars from his door, Votes for my Lord, and hates the thankless poor.” VII. Hail, Sister Hills, that from each other hide, With belts of evergreen, your mutual pride! Here reigns, in placid splendour, Madam Grade, Whose husband nobly made a plum in trade; And yonder glitters Rapine's bilious slave, The lucky footman of a palaced knave; Stern foe of learning, genius, press, and pen, Who lauds all laws that ruin honest men. Sublime in Satrap-imitating state, She for her daughter seeks a titled mate; None other, not an angel wing'd from heav'n, Could woo, or ask to woo, and be forgiv'n. Too oft, perhaps, she calls her neighbour “Scrub!” Yet justly scorns the mean corruption-grub; For many a “ruptured Ogden” hath he wrong'd, Long gloating on the captive's chain prolong'd. He hates and apes her pomp, with upstart haste; But what in him is pride, in her is taste. She, queen-like, smiles; he, blustering, crams and treats, And weighs his greatness by the trout he eats. She never dogg'd a beggar from her lawn, And he would hang all dogs that will not fawn. Yet, Clerk of taxes, Magistrate, and Squire, Why to be Premier may not he aspire? But what is he that haunts this upstart's door— Yon fat, good fellow, who detests the poor— Yon mass of meanness, baseness, grease, and bone— Yon jolly soul, that weighs just eighteen stone? Unmatch'd in quibble, great in If and But, Sublime in cant, superlative in smut; He jests as none but British worthies can, Laughs at despair, spurns, tramples fallen man, Condemns misfortune for its wrongs and woe, And bids his victim thank him for a blow. Sworn friends are they, Squire Woolpack and Squire Brush; One is their creed—“Impoverish! torture! crush!” Behold two models, unexcell'd on earth, Of British wisdom, loyalty, and worth! VIII. Broad Beech! thyself a grove! five hundred years Speak in thy voice of bygone hopes and fears; And mournfully—how mournfully!—the breeze Sighs through thy boughs, and tells of cottages That, happy once, beneath thy shadow gazed On poor men's fields, which poor men's cattle grazed! Now, where three cotters and their children dwelt, The lawyer's pomp alone is seen and felt; And the park-entrance of his acres three Uncrops the ground which fed a family. What then? All see he is a man of state, With his three acres, and his park-like gate! Besides, in time, if times continue dark, His neighbour's woes may buy his gate a park. O, then, let trade wear chains, that toil may find No harvests on the barren sea and wind; Nor glean, at home, the fields of every zone, Nor make the valleys of all climes his own; But, with the music of his hopeless sigh, Charm the blind worm that feeds on poverty! IX. Lo; where the water-caster once abode, The pinfold, erst his garden, skirts the road! His ample cot, erewhile not ample call'd, Is now with lath and lime partition-wall'd: The humble dwelling of the leech divine Makes six large styes for thirty human swine. Oh! could he see what woes his house contains, What wretched remnants cram its broken panes, How would he swell with righteous rage, and ban Ice-hearted Law's forced charity to man! For warmer heart than his did never beat! Duped by himself, yet hated he deceit; And, pleased, he taught my boyhood how to draw The woe-marked cowslip, and the thrush-loved haw; And how to make sweet pictures of wild flowers, Cull'd in lone lanes, when glow'd the sultry hours, Then press'd, and dried, and all on lawn dispread, To look as infants do, that smile when dead. Learnèd he was: nor bird nor insect flew But he its leafy home and history knew; Nor wild-flower deck'd the rock nor moss the well But he its name and qualities could tell. Yes, he was learnèd—not with learning big, Like yon budge doctor of the whip and wig, Who writes in Latin, sucks the sick select, Speaks in the Babylonish dialect, And drives his pair. Great man, sir!—all who thrive Are cured of colds and cash, by Doctor Drive. Behold his mansion, southward of the grove, Complete with coach-house—piggery—alcove! And, mark! the entrance hath an air of state— Not copied from the lawyer's park-like gate! X. Two stone-throws from the Hall of Doctor Drive, And from the village Workhouse four or five, Where the swung Turkey, with its plumage rough, Welcomes all loyal men who drink enough, The flying curate lodges—doom'd to say Three well-known sermons every Sabbath-day. His donkey, like a rat without a tail, Cost fifty shillings, and o'er hill and dale Bears his lean master, at a hunter's pace, Duly as comes his weekly steeple-chase. The rector—a queer plural, one and three, Yet not quite singular in trilogy— Who, scandal says, is cousin to my Lord— Would pay him better, but he can't afford. He lives, they say, in London, and so forth; His country house is somewhere in the North. Mine host much miss'd him when he left the lodge, For fewer warrants summon Jem and Hodge. XI. Hail, ancient Inn! once kept by Margaret Rose, Ere England's wrongs began, and labour's woes; Inn of the Happy Village! where, of old, Before the bright yule log, my father told His well-known story of the wolf and child, While—not at him—the tickled youngsters smiled; And sturdy peasants, and the annual guest, Praised the stout ale, but thought their own was best. When Margaret reign'd, no wanderer pass'd thy door: Dame Margaret's heart felt ever for the poor; And, well they knew, to homeless son or sire She ne'er denied a seat beside the fire, Nor cursed away the widow, stooping low Beneath the double weight of age and woe. But times are changed and alter'd is the inn, For God is wroth, and Britain rife with sin. The village, happy once, is splendid now! And at the Turkey reigns, with knotted brow, Stiff as a mile-stone, set up in his bar, Vice-regal Constable and Bailiff Marr, Who nods his “yes,” and frowns his fatal “no.” Woe to the scrimp that ventures near him, woe! He, she, or it—“swag's nifle, skink, or trull,” Shall find a bed, or Wakefield's gaol is full! Great man, John Marr! He shoots—or who else may? He knows my Lord, is loyal, and can pay. The poor all hate him, fear him—all save one; Broad Jem, the poacher, dreaded is by John. To draw him drink, objects nor man nor maid; The froth is brought, Jem winks, and John is paid; For John, who hates all poachers, likes poor Jem, While Jem, so kind to others, growls at him; And when their fierce eyes meet, the tax-made slave Quakes in his inmost soul, if soul he have, Thinking of weasand slit by lantern light, Or slug bang'd through him at the dead of night. Yet great is he! rich, prudent, tried, and true: He snores at sermon in his curtain'd pew— He knows the Steward—he is known afar To magistrates and bums—great man, John Marr! XII. Where yon red villa flares before the wood, The cottage of my Hannah's father stood; That woodbined cottage, girt with orchard trees, Last left, and earliest found, by birds and bees: And where the river winds, gnarl'd oaks between, Squatter'd his drake, and diving ducks were seen; While scotting hares oft sought this summit bare, If lightning glinted through the glooming air. But where dwells Hannah now? And where is he?— Gone, like the home of her nativity. And what vain dame, and what suburban Thane, The site of Hannah's lovely home profane? Who dash'd the plum-trees from the blossomy ridge? From bank to bank, who threw the baby bridge, Where the huge elm, which twenty bullocks drew, Plank'd o'er with ash, and rootless, sternly grew, While plumy ferns wept o'er the waters dark, Sad for his fall; and, rooted in his bark, A world of mosses forested the side Of that fall'n Forest King, to soothe his pride? What dandy Goth the heaven-made arch displaced, To show in painted spars his want of taste? A mortgaged magnate and a sage is he: His maxims have a deep philosophy. “Hateful,” he saith, “and vulgar is the flat, Who deigns to see a poor man touch his hat, Or serves a beggar, though her curtsey fall, Or of the rabble does not take the wall.” Squire Grub is proud—for pride and meanness blamed, Yet poor as proud, and of his wants ashamed. Lo! there he struts—the silk-legged King of Cant! Who thanks the Blessèd powers for crime and want, Prays to his Demon of Despotic sway And hymns his God of Carnage! Let him pray! Yes, pray for strength or weakness, to sustain The weight of scorn that will crush in his brain, Ere from the Workhouse, like a ghost, he go To mate with madmen, in their den of woe, And tell them that he is not poor—not he;— But lord of vast estates—in Chancery! XIII. Path of the quiet fields! that oft of yore Call'd me at morn, on Shenstone's page to pore: O poor man's footpath! where, at evening's close, He stoop'd, to pluck the woodbine and the rose, Shaking the dew-drops from the wild-brier bowers, That stoop'd beneath their load of summer flowers, Then eyed the west, still bright with fading flame, As whistling homeward by the wood he came; Sweet, dewy, sunny, flowery footpath, thou Art gone for ever, like the poor man's cow! No more the wandering townsman's Sabbath smile— No more the hedger, waiting on the stile For tardy Jane—no more the muttering bard, Startling the heifer, near the lone farm-yard— No more the pious youth, with book in hand, Spelling the words he fain would understand, Shall bless thy mazes, when the village bell Sounds o'er the river, soften'd up the dell: But from the parlour of the loyal inn, The Great Unpaid, who cannot err nor sin, Shall see, well-pleased, the pomp of Lawyer Ridge, And poor Squire Grub's starved maids, and dandy bridge, Where youngling fishers, in the grassy lane, Purloin'd their tackle from the brood-mare's mane— And truant urchins, by the river's brink, Caught the fledged throstle as it stoop'd to drink— Or with the ramping colt all joyous play'd, Or scared the owlet in the blue-bell'd shade. XIV. Churl Jem! why dost thou thrust me from the wall? I hack no cab, I sham no servant's hall: Coarse is my coat:—how have I earn'd thy curse? Suspectest thou there's money in my purse? I said, “Good day, sir,” and I touch'd my hat: Art thou, then, vulgar, as the Sage is flat? Alas! that Sage sees not in thy fierce eyes Fire-flooded towers, and pride, that shrieks and dies; The red-foam'd deluge, and the sea-wide tomb; The arm of vengeance, and the brow of doom; The grin of millions o'er the shock of all— A people's wreck, an empire's funeral! Part II. THE WANDERER DEPARTED. I. Dear Village! changed—how changed from what thou wert! Thy good to bane thy beggar-kings convert. They say that, discontented with our lot, We envy wealth, because we have it not; That, could we call yon glowing pile our own, No wight alive would hear our tuneful groan. They ask why writhes the serpent on our brow? When prosper'd England as she prospers now? They err. We envy not the pomp we see, But hate that wealth which makes our poverty. If talent thrive, and enterprise prevail, Restore to rustic toil his beef and ale; Be few, or many, splendid, as they can, But let not misery make a fiend of man! II. Yes, splendid mansions now these shades adorn, But wretched children in these huts are born! There dwell the heirs of unremitting toil, Who till, but not in hope, a teeming soil, While Erin's hordes contest with them the plain, And competition low'rs the price of pain. What though proud homes their lofty roofs uprear, If humble homes and comfort disappear? O baneful splendour! that but glitters o'er What may be ruin, and is bliss no more! As beacons fired on some far mountain's brow, Shimmer o'er hamlets, black with plague, below, Where health once glow'd in every fearless face, And in the motions of all forms was grace— I look on pomp, that apes a bloated crew, While beggar'd millions hate the biggen'd few. Like rocks of ice our fatal wealth is found; Not like the sea that spreads those rocks around: Hark! o'er their peaks a wild and bird-like wail Tells of approaching thunder, fire, and hail! Lo! at their feet, while cold and bright they sleep, Mines hunger's fathomless and boundless deep! III. Feast of the Village!—yearly held, when June Sate with the rose, to hear the goldspink's tune, And lovers, happy as the warbling bird, Breathed raptures sweeter than the songs they heard, Stealing through lanes, sun-bright with dewy broom, By fragrant hedge-rows, sheeted o'er with bloom;— Feast of the Happy Village! where art thou? Pshaw! thou wast vulgar—we are splendid now. Yet, poor man's pudding!—rich with spicy crumbs, And tiers of currants, thick as both my thumbs— Where art thou, festal pudding of our sires? Gone, to feed fat the heirs of thieves and liars; Gone, to oppress the wrong'd, the true, the brave, And, wide and deep, dig Poland's second grave; Gone, like the harvest pie, a bullock's load, Four feet across, with crust six inches broad; Gone, like poor England's Satrap-swallow'd store; Gone, as her trade will go, to come no more! Well, let it go, and with it the glad hours That yearly o'er kind hearts shed cottage flowers. Nor sisters' daughters now, nor sons of sons, Shall seek the bridge, where still the river runs, And bless the roof where busy hands prepared The festal plenty which their fathers shared; When, round their grandsire met, his numerous race Beheld their children's children in his face; Saw in his eyes the light of suns gone down, And hoped they saw in his white locks their own. No more, no more, beneath his smile serene, The generations shall in joy convene, All eager to obey the annual call, And twang the chord of love that bound them all. IV. When daisies blush, and windflowers wet with dew; When shady lanes with hyacinths are blue; When the elm blossoms o'er the brooding bird, And, wild and wide, the plover's wail is heard Where melts the mist on mountains far away, 'Till morn is kindled into brightest day; No more the shouting youngsters shall convene, To play at leap-frog on the village-green, While lasses ripening into love, admire, And youth's first raptures cheer the gazing sire. The Green is gone! and barren splendours gleam, Where hiss'd the gander at the passing team, And the gay traveller from the city praised The poor man's cow, and, weary, stopp'd and gazed. V. Where yon broad mansion's tax-built drawing-room Displays its corniced-gold, dwelt Mary Broom— Close by the marble hearth her garden smiled— The widow'd mother of an only child. I saw her to the house of marriage move, And weeping o'er the grave of hope and love. Now, where the woe-worn and the weary rest, The child is sleeping on its mother's breast. Not long she mourn'd in duty's lonely shade— No praise expecting—and she ask'd no aid, But toil'd and faded silently, and stood Alike unnoticed by the bad and good, Dropping meek tears into the sea of days, Like a pale flower, that, all unseen, displays Its pensive beauty on a river's brink; While overhead the stars rush wild and wink; And shadows, cast on earth at night's bright noon, Move with the clouds, that chase the full-orb'd moon. Oh, happy! with her own proud crust supplied, In her own bed, a Britoness she died! In her own shroud her modest state she keeps! In her own coffin, gloriously, she sleeps! Not thus the brother of her soul would die; O'er him, poor pauper, none will heave a sigh; No windflower, emblem of his youth, be laid To blush for promise in its bloom decay'd; Nor, emblem of his age, and hopeless pain, The dismal daisy of sad autumn's wane: But Workhouse idiots, and the limping slave, In four rough boards shall bear him to his grave. VI. Where is the Common, once with blessings rich— The poor man's Common?—like the poor man's flitch And well-fed ham, which erst his means allow'd, 'Tis gone to bloat the idle and the proud! To raise high rents! and lower low profits!—O, To-morrow of the furies! thou art slow; But where, thou tax-plough'd waste, is now the hind Who lean'd on his own strength, his heart and mind? Where is the matron, with her busy brow? Their sheep—where are they? and their famous cow? Their strutting game-cock, with his many queens? Their glowing hollyoaks, and winter greens? The chubby lad, that cheer'd them with his look, And shared his breakfast with the home-bred rook? The blooming girls, that scour'd the snow-white pail, Then waked with joy the echoes of the vale, And, laden homewards, near the sparkling rill, Cropp'd the first rose that blush'd beneath the hill? All vanish'd—with their rights, their hopes, their lands; The shoulder-shaking grasp of hearts and hands; The good old joke, applauded still as new; The wondrous printed tale, which must be true; And the stout ale, that show'd the matron's skill, For, not to be improved, it mended still! Now, lo! the young look base, as greybeard guile! The very children seem afraid to smile, But not afraid to scowl, with early hate, At would-be greatness, or the greedy great; For they who fling the poor man's worth away, Root out security, and plant dismay. Law of the lawless! hast thou conquer'd Heav'n? Then shall the worm that dies not be forgiven. VII. But yonder stalks the greatest man alive! One farmer prospers now, where prosper'd five! Ah! where are they?—wives, husbands, children—where?— Two died in jail, and one is dying there; One broken-hearted, fills a rural grave; And one still lives, a pauper and a slave. Where are their children?—Some, beyond the main, Convicts for crime; some, here, in hopeless pain, Poor wanderers, blue with want; and some are dead; And some, in towns, earn deathily their bread. All rogues, they died, or fail'd—twas no great harm; Why ask who fails, if Jolter gets a farm? Full well thrives he—the man is not a fool, Albeit a tyrant, and his landlord's tool. He courses; he affords, and can afford, To keep his blood, and fox-hunt with my Lord. He dwells where dwelt the knight, for greyhounds famed, Who also with his Satrap coursed and gamed; The last of all the little landed Thanes, Whose acres bound his Lordship's wide domains. VIII. Oh, happy, if they knew their bliss, are they Who, poor themselves, unbounded wealth survey; Who nor in ships, nor cabs, nor chariots go, To view the miracles of art below; But, near their homes, behold august abodes, That like the temples seem of all the gods! Nor err they, if they sometimes kneel in pray'r At shrines like those, for God-like powers are there; Powers that on railroads base no treasures waste, Nor build huge mills, that blush like brick at taste, Where labour fifteen hours, for twice a groat, The half-angelic heirs of speech and thought: But pour profusion from a golden hand, To deck with Grecian forms a Gothic land. Hence, yeoman, hence!—thy grandsire's land resign; Yield, peasant, to my Lord and power divine! Thy grange is gone, your cluster'd hovels fall; Proud domes expand, the park extends its wall; Then kennels rise, the massive Tuscan grows; And dogs sublime, like couchant kings, repose! Lo! “still-all-Greek-and-glorious” Art is here! Behold the pagod of a British peer! Admire, ye proud! and clap your hands, ye poor! The father of this kingling was a boor! Not Ispahan, nor Stamboul—though their thrones Make Satraps out of dead-men's blood and bones, And play at death, as God-like power will play— Can match free Britain's ancients of to-day. IX. But me nor palaces nor Satraps please; I love to look on happy cottages; The gems I seek are seen in Virtue's eye; These gauds disgust me, and I pass them by. Show me a home like that I knew of old, Ere heads grew hot with pride, and bosoms cold; Some frank good deeds, which simple truth may praise, Some moral grace, on which the heart may gaze, Some little hopes that give to toil its zest, The equal rights that make the labourer blest, The smile in which eternal love we scan, And thank his Maker while we look on man. X. I dream'd last night of forests and the sea! My long-lost Hannah! lives she still for me? Is she a matron, loved by him she loves? A mother, whom paternal Heav'n approves? Perchance a widow? Nay, I would not wed The widow of my rival's happier bed. Nor come I to oppress her with my gaze, Or bring disgrace upon her latter days. Forgotten now, perchance, though once too dear, I yet will sojourn near her—oh, not here! For thou, sweet Village! proud in thy decline, Art too, too splendid for a heart like mine! In England, then, can no green spot be found Where men remain whose sympathies are sound? There would I dwell; and, wandering thence, draw nigh Her envied home—but not to meet her eye: Perchance to see her shadow, or again Hear her soft voice, with sadly-pleasing pain. XI. I dream'd I saw her, heard her—but she fled! In vain I seek her—is she with the dead? No meek blue eye, like hers, hath turn'd to me, And deign'd to know the pilgrim of the sea. I have not named her—no—I dare not name! When I would speak, why burns my cheek with shame? I join'd the schoolboys, where the road is wide, I watch'd the women to the fountain's side, I read their faces, as the wise read books, And look'd for Hannah in their wondering looks: But in no living aspect could I trace The sweet May-morning of my Hannah's face; No, nor its evening, fading into night— O Sun! my soul grows weary of thy light! XII. I sought the churchyard where the lifeless lie, And envied them—they rest so peacefully! “No wretch comes here, at dead of night,” I said, “To drag the weary from his hard-earn'd bed; No schoolboys here with mournful relics play, And kick ‘the dome of thought’ o'er common clay; No city cur snarls here o'er dead-men's bones; No sordid fiend removes memorial stones: The dead have here what to the dead belongs, Though legislation makes not laws, but wrongs.” I sought a letter'd stone, on which my tears Had fall'n like thunder-rain, in other years; My mother's grave I sought, in my despair, But found it not!—Our gravestone was not there! No, we were fallen men, mere Workhouse slaves— And how could fallen men have names or graves? I thought of sorrow in the wilderness, And death in solitude, and pitiless Interment in the tiger's hideous maw; I pray'd; and, praying, turn'd from all I saw. My prayers were curses!—But the sexton came: How my heart yearn'd to name my Hannah's name! White was his hair, for full of days was he; He walk'd o'er tombstones, like their history. With well-feign'd carelessness I raised a spade, Left near a grave, which seem'd but newly made, And ask'd who slept below? “You knew him well,” The old man answer'd, “sir, his name was Bell. He had a sister—she, alas! is gone, Body and soul, sir! for she married one Unworthy of her. Many a corpse he took From this churchyard.” And then his head he shook, And utter'd—whispering low, as if in fear That the old stones and senseless dead would hear— A word—a verb, a noun—too widely famed, Which makes me blush to hear my country named. That word he utter'd gazing on my face, As if he loathed my thoughts, then paused a space. “Sir,” he resumed, “a sad death Hannah died; Her husband kill'd her, or his own son lied. Vain is your voyage o'er the briny wave, If here you seek her grave—she had no grave! The terror-stricken murderer fled before His crime was known, and ne'er was heard of more. The poor boy died, sir, uttering fearful cries In his last dreams, and with his glaring eyes, And troubled hands, seem'd acting, as it were, His mother's fate. Yes, sir, his grave is there. But you are ill? Your looks make me afraid— My God! how frightfully he shakes the spade!” XIII. Oh, welcome once again black ocean's foam! England! can this be England?—this my home? This country of the crime without a name, And men who know nor mercy, hope, nor shame? O Light! that cheer'st all life, from sky to sky, As with a hymn, to which the stars reply! Canst thou behold this land, O holy light! And not turn black with horror at the sight? Fall'n country of my fathers! fall'n and foul! Thy body still is here, but where the soul? I look upon a corpse—'tis putrid clay— And fiends possess it. Vampires, quit your prey! Or vainly tremble, when the dead arise, Clarion'd to vengeance by shriek-shaken skies, And cranch your hearts, and drink your blood for ale! Then eat each other, till the banquet fail! O thou dark tower that look'st o'er ancient woods To see the tree of fire put forth its buds! Baronial Keep! whose ruins, ivy-grown, The time-touch'd ash mistakes for living stone, Grasping them with his writhen roots, and fast Binding the present with the faded past! While, cropp'd with every crime, the tax-plough'd moor, And footpaths stolen from the trampled poor, And commons, sown with curses loud and deep, Proclaim a harvest, which the rich shall reap— Call up the iron men of Runnymead, And bid them look on lords, whom peasants feed! Then—when the worm slinks down at nature's groan, And with the shrieking heav'ns thy dungeons moan— O'er the loud fall of greatness, misery fed, Let their fierce laugh awake their vassals dead, The shaft-famed men, whom yet tradition sings, Who served, but did not feed, the fear'd of kings, To join the wondering laugh, and wilder yell, While England flames—“a garden” and a hell. XIV. Again upon the deep I toss and swing! The bounding billow lifts me, like the wing Of the struck eagle—and away I dart, Bearing afar the arrow in my heart. For thou art with me, though I see no more Thee, stream-loved England! Thy impatient shore Hath sunk beneath me—miles, a thousand miles; Yet, in my heart, thy verdant Eden smiles. Land where my Hannah died, and hath no tomb! Still in my soul thy dewy roses bloom. E'en in Niagara's roar, remembrance still Shall hear thy throstle, o'er the lucid rill, At lucid eve—thy bee, at stillest noon; And, when clouds chase the heart-awaking moon, The mocking-bird, where Erie's waters swell, Shall sing of fountain'd vales and philomel; To my sick soul bring over worlds of waves, Dew-glistening Albion's woods, and dripping caves; But—with her linnet, redbreast, lark, and wren— Her blasted homes and much-enduring men! THEY MET IN HEAVEN. I. Through realms of ice my journey lay, beneath The wafture of two pinions black and vast, That shook o'er boundless snows the dust of death, While overhead, thick starless Midnight cast Gloom on sad forms, that ever onward pass'd. But whither pass'd they? O Eternity, Thou answerest not! Yet still thy sable wings— Silently, silently, how silently!— Are sweeping worlds away, with all their Kings. And still I wander'd with forgotten things, In pilgrimage with Death, an age-long day, A year of anxious ages—so methought— Till rose a living world in morning grey, And light seem'd born of darkness—light which brought Before my soul the coasts of land remote. “Hail, holy light, offspring of Heav'n, first-born, Or of the eternal, coeternal beam!” Through worlds of darkness led, and travel-worn, Again I felt thy glowing, brightening gleam; Again I greeted thine “ethereal stream,” And bless'd the fountain whence thy glories flow. II. I waked not then, methought, but wander'd slow, Where dwell the great, whom death hath freed from pain. Trembling, I gazed on Hampden's thoughtful brow, While Strafford smiled upon me in disdain, And turn'd away from Hutchison and Vane. There some whom criminals disdain'd; and all Who, battling for the right, had nobly died; And some whom justest men deem'd criminal, Wond'ring, I saw—the flatter'd, the belied! And Muir and Saville, walking side by side! They wept—e'en Strafford melted, when I told Of Britain's woes—of toil that earn'd not bread, And hands that found not work; but Fairfax scowl'd, While Cromwell laugh'd, and Russell's cheek grew red, When, pale, I spake of Satraps bread-tax-fed. Lo! as I ceased, from earth a Stranger came, With hurried step—a presence heavenly fair! Yet grief, and anger, pride, contempt, and shame Were strangely mingled in his troubled stare! And thus he spoke, with timid haughty air, To Russell, Fairfax, in tones low but sweet:— “I, too, am noble. England's magnates rank Me with themselves; and when, beneath their feet Fate's low-born despot, hope-deserted, sank; When torrid noon his sweat of horror drank, I join'd his name for ever with my own!” III. Him then to answer, one who sate alone, Like a maim'd lion, mateless in his lair, Rose from his savage couch of barren stone. His kingly features wither'd by despair, And heart-worn till the tortured nerve was bare: With looks that seem'd to scorn e'en scorn of less Than demigods, the Army-Scatterer came— An awful shadow of the mightiness That once was his; the gloom, but not the flame Of waning storms, when winds and seas grow tame. The stranger, shrinking from the warrior's eye, On his own hands his beauteous visage bow'd, Sobbing; but soon he raised it mournfully, And met th' accusing look, and on the crowd Smiled, while the stern accuser spake aloud. IV. “Yet, Lordling, If it be objected to these lines that the great bard is dead, so, I answer, is also the great warrior; and he who has honest and useful thoughts to express of either, or both of them, should do his duty Briton-like. though ‘but yesterday a King, Throneless, I died,’ yet nations sobb'd my knell! And still I live, and reign, no nameless thing! I fell, 'tis true—I failed; and thou canst tell That any wretch alive may say I fell, Of worth convicted, and the glorious sin That wreck'd the angels, now I owe and pay, To wealth and power's pretended Jacobin, Scorn for thy glory, laughter for the lay That won the flatteries of an abject day. When Meanness taught her helots to be proud, Because the breaker of their bonds was gone, Didst thou too join, magnanimous and loud, The yell of millions o'er the prostrate one? What cat out-mew'd the Cat of Helicon? Yes, thou didst soothe my sorrows with an ode, When stunn'd I lay beneath Destruction's wing, And realms embattled o'er their conqueror rode. Yes, when a world combined with fate to fling A cruel sunshine on each vulgar King; When fall'n, deserted, blasted, and alone, Silent he press'd his bed of burning stone, What caitiff aim'd at his sublime despair, Th' immortal shaft that pierced Prometheus there? Cat, and not vulture! couldst not thou refrain, The laureate vile of viler things to be? When ‘Timour's Captive's’ cage was rock and main, What was ‘proud Austria's mournful flower’ to thee, Thou soulless torturer of Captivity? And what to thee, mean Homager of Thrones, The sleepless pang that stung him till he died? Tortured, he perish'd—but who heard his groans? Chain'd through the soul, the ‘throneless homicide’ Mantled his agony in stoic pride. While souls guilt-clotted watch'd, with others' eyes, And from afar, with others' feet repair'd To count and weigh, and quaff his agonies— Like Phidian marble he endured, and dared The Universe to shake what Fate had spared. How fare the lands he loved, and fought to save? O Hun and Goth! your new-born hope is gone! Thou, Italy, art Glory's spacious grave, Through which the stream of my renown flows on— Like thine Euphrates, ruin'd Babylon! What gain'd my gaolers by my wrongs and fall? Laws praised in hell—not Draco's laws, but worse; A mournful page, which history writes in gall; A table without food—an empty purse; A name, become a by-word and a curse, O'er every sea, to warn all nations, borne!” V. Was it the brightening gleam of heavenly morn, Beneath the shadow of his godlike brow? Or, did a tear of grief, and rage, and scorn, Down his sad cheek of pride and trouble flow? He felt upon his cheek th' indignant glow, But shed no tear, not e'en a burning tear. The fire of sorrow in his bosom pent, He gazed on Milton, with an eye severe, On tranquil Pym a look of sternness bent, Then, smiling on the humbled stranger, went To laugh with Cæsar tasking Hannibal. WHAT ART THOU, MIND? To that true Christian and Patriot, the Reverend Henry Wrightson, this Poem is dedicated by the Author. Grief, sages tell us, hath a drooping wing, And loves to perch upon the shaken mind, To which she sings notes like the muttering Of wintry rivers in the wintry wind, Till health flies wing'd away and leaves behind Shadows, illusions, dreams, and worse than dreams. But Alfred dreams not—he is wide awake! Light is around him, and the chime of streams; Bees hum o'er sallows yet; and in the brake, Coil'd like a chain of amethyst, the snake Basks on the bank, above the streamlet's flow. Oh, there are beauteous plumes, and many a bill, And life, and love, beneath the ivy's bough! The swallow dips his purple in the rill, The lark sings in the cloud, and from the hill The blackbird's song replies. But Alfred's ear, Nor splashing swallow hears, nor humming bee, Nor warbling lark, nor ivy shaken near By brooding thrush, nor breeze-born melody Of chiming streams. He listens mournfully To accents which the earth shall hear no more! What art thou, Mind, that mirror'st things unseen, Giv'st to the dead the smiles which erst they wore, And lift'st the veil which fate hath cast between Thee and the forms which are not, but have been? What art thou, conscious power, that hear'st the mute, And feel'st th' impalpable? Thy magic brings Back to our hearts the warblings of the lute, Which long had slept with unexisting things! And shall we stand, doubting immortal wings, In presence of the angels? Ask the worm, And she will bid thee doubt; yet she is meek, And wise—for when earth shakes, she shuns thy form, But never saw the morning on thy cheek, The blue heav'n in thine eye, the lightning break In laughter from thy lips. So she denies That colours are, even while the fragrant thorn Blossoms above her! Weight, and shape, and size, She says, are real; but she laughs to scorn The gorgeous rainbow, and the blushing morn, And can disprove the glory of the rose!— Yet doth she err; our limbless sister errs; For on thy cheek, O Man! the morning glows, And fair is heaven's bright bow. The wayside furze Discredits her; the humblest weed that stirs Its small green leaves, can undemonstrate all Her proofs triumphant, that celestial light Shines not at noon. But though the sunflower tall, And tiniest moss are clad in liveries bright, Never, to her, can'st thou disprove the night, The starless night, in which she hath her home! Then, marvel not, if death-bless'd spirits free Wander, at times, beneath this heavenly dome, On wings too bright for mortal eyes to see; While, unperceived by them, as both by thee, Forms, more seraphic still, around us fly, And stoop to them and thee, with looks of love; Or vainly strain the archangelic eye, To gaze on holier forms above, above, That round the throne of heaven's Almighty move. O look on Alfred!—look! the man is blind! She whom he loved sleeps in her winding-sheet, Yet he beholds her with the eyes of mind! He sees the form which he no more shall meet, But cannot see the primrose at his feet! They mingle tears with tears, and sighs with sighs, And sobs with sobs, but words, long time, have none; She looks her soul into his sightless eyes, And, like a passionate thought, is come and gone, While at his feet, unheard, the bright rill babbles on! STEAM AT SHEFFIELD. To Charles Hindley, Esq., M.P., one of our creators of national wealth—who, while they enrich themselves, silently reproach the splendid drones of society, by increasing the productive capital of the State—I inscribe this humble Poem, wishing it were worthier. I. Well, gaze thou on the hills, and hedge-side flowers! But blind old Andrew will with me repair To yonder massive pile, where useful powers, Toiling unconsciously, aloud declare That man, too, and his works, are grand and fair. Son of the far-famed self-taught engineer, Whose deeds were marvels in the bygone days! Ill it becomes thee, with ungrateful sneer, The trade-fed town and townsmen to dispraise. Why rail at Traffic's wheels, and crowded ways? Trade makes thee rich; then, William, murmur not Though Trade's black vapours ever round thee rise. Trade makes thee sage; lo! thou read'st Locke and Scott! While the poor rustic, beast-like, lives and dies, Blind to the page of priceless mysteries! “Fair is the bow that spans the shower,” thou say'st, “But all unlovely, as an eyeless skull, Is man's black workshop in the streeted waste.” And can the city's smoke be worse than dull, If Martin found it more than beautiful? Did he, did Martin steal immortal hues From London's cloud, or Carron's gloomy glare— Light-darken'd shadows, such as Milton's muse Cast o'er th' Eternal—and shalt thou despair To find, where man is found, the grand and fair? Can'st thou love Nature, and not love the sound Of cheerful labour? He who loathes the crew To whose hard hands the toiling oar is bound, Is dark of spirit, bilious as his hue, And bread-tax-dyed in Tory lust's true blue. “Thou lov'st the woods, the rocks, the quiet fields!” But tell me, if thou can'st, enthusiast wan! Why the broad town to thee no gladness yields? If thou lov'st Nature sympathize with man; For he and his are parts of Nature's plan. But can'st thou love her if she love not thee? She will be wholly loved, or not at all. Thou lov'st her streams, her flowers; thou lov'st to see The gorgeous halcyon strike the bulrush tall Thou lov'st to feel the veil of evening fall, Like gentlest slumber, on a happy bride; For these are Nature's! Art not thou hers too? A portion of her pageantry and pride; In all thy passions, all thou seek'st to do, And all thou dost? The earth-worm is allied To God, and will not have her claims denied, Though thou disown her fellow-worm, and scorn The lowly beauty of his toil and care. “Sweet is the whisper of the breezy morn To waking streams.” And hath the useful share No splendour? Doth the tilter's cottage wear No smiles for thee? “How beauteous are the dyes That grove and hedgerow from their plumage shake!” And cannot the loud hammer, which supplies Food for the blacksmith's rosy children, make Sweet music to thy heart? “Behold the snake Couch'd on its bed of beams.” The scaly worm Is lovely, coil'd above the river's flow; But there is nobler beauty in the form That welds the hissing steel, with ponderous blow; Yea, there is majesty on that calm brow, And in those eyes the light of thoughts divine! II. Come, blind old Andrew Turner! link in mine Thy time-tried arm, and cross the town with me; For there are wonders mightier far than thine; Watt! and his million-feeding enginery! Steam-miracles of demi-deity! Thou can'st not see, unnumber'd chimneys o'er, From chimneys tall the smoky cloud aspire; But thou can'st hear the unwearied crash and roar Of iron powers, that, urged by restless fire, Toil ceaseless, day and night, yet never tire, Or say to greedy man, “Thou dost amiss.” III. Oh, there is glorious harmony in this Tempestuous music of the giant, Steam, Commingling growl, and roar, and stamp, and hiss, With flame and darkness! Like a Cyclop's dream, It stuns our wondering souls, that start and scream With joy and terror; while, like gold on snow Is morning's beam on Andrew's hoary hair! Like gold on pearl is morning on his brow! His hat is in his hand, his head is bare; And, rolling wide his sightless eyes, he stands Before this metal god, that yet shall chase The tyrant idols of remotest lands, Preach science to the desert, and efface The barren curse from every pathless place Where virtues have not yet atoned for crimes. He loves the thunder of machinery! It is beneficent thunder, though, at times, Like heaven's red bolt, it lightens fatally. Poor blind old man! what would he give to see This bloodless Waterloo! this hell of wheels; This dreadful speed, that seems to sleep and snore, And dream of earthquake! In his brain he feels The mighty arm of mist, that shakes the shore Along the throng'd canal, in ceaseless roar Urging the heavy forge, the clanking mill, The rapid tilt, and screaming, sparkling stone. Is this the spot where stoop'd the ash-crown'd hill To meet the vale, when bee-loved banks, o'ergrown With broom and woodbine, heard the cushat lone Coo for her absent love?—Oh, ne'er again Will Andrew pluck the freckled foxglove here! How like a monster, with a league-long mane, Or Titan's rocket, in its high career, Towers the dense smoke! The falcon, wheeling near, Turns, and the angry crow seeks purer skies. IV. At first, with lifted hands in mute surprise, Old Andrew listens to the mingled sound Of hammer, roll, and wheel. His sightless eyes Brighten with generous pride, that man hath found Redemption from the manacles which bound His powers for many an age. A poor man's boy Constructed these grand works! Lo! like the sun, Shines knowledge now on all! He thinks with joy Of that futurity which is begun— Of that great victory which shall be won By Truth o'er Falsehood; and already feels Earth shaken by the conflict. But a low Deep sigh escapes him; sadness o'er him steals, Shading his noble heart with selfish woe; Yes, Envy clouds his melancholy brow. What! shall the good old times, in aught of good, Yield to the days of cant and parish pay, The sister-growth of twenty years of blood? His ancient fame, he feels, is past away; He is no more the wonder of his day— The far-praised, self-taught, matchless engineer! V. But he is still the man who planted here The first steam-engine seen in all the shire— Laugh'd at by many an Eldon far and near— While sundry sage Newcastles, in their ire, Swore that a roasting in his boiler fire Would best reward the maker. Round his form The spirit of the Moors wrapp'd fold on fold Of thund'rous gloom, and flash'd th' indignant storm From his dilating eyes, when first uproll'd The volumed smoke, that, like a prophet, told Of horrors yet to come. His angry scowl Cast night at noon o'er Rivelin and Don, And scared o'er Loxley's springs the screaming fowl; For rill and river listen'd, every one, When the old Tory put his darkness on. Full soon his deep and hollow voice forth brake, Cursing the tilting, tipling, strange machine; And then the lightning of his laughter spake, Calling the thing a “Whimsy.” When the steam-engine (not Watt's) was first employed in drawing coals from mines, it was nick-named a “Whimsy,” by the admirers of the wisdom of our ancestors; and to this day, that description of steam-engine is called a “Whimsy,” in the coal districts. To this day A “Whimsy” it is call'd, wherever seen; And strangers, travelling by the mail, may see The coal-devouring monster, as he rides, And wonder what the uncouth beast may be That canters, like a horse with wooden sides, And lifts his food from depths where night presides, With winking taper, o'er the in-back'd slave, Who, laid face upward, hews the black stone down. The colliers are all weasel-backed, in consequence of the position in which they work. Poor living corpse! he labours in the grave; Poor two-legg'd mole! he mines for half-a-crown From morn to eve—that wolves, who sleep on down, And pare our bones, may eat their bread-tax warm! VI. But could poor Andrew's “Whimsy” boast an arm, A back like these? Upstart of Yesterday! Thou doubler of the rent of every farm, From John o' Groat's to Cornwall's farthest bay! Engine of Watt! unrivall'd is thy sway. Compared with thine, what is the tyrant's power? His might destroys, while thine creates and saves. Thy triumphs live and grow, like fruit and flower; But his are writ in blood, and read on graves! Let him yoke all his regimented slaves, And bid them strive to wield thy tireless fly, As thou canst wield it. Soon his baffled bands Would yield to thee, despite his wrathful eye. Lo! unto thee both Indies lift their hands! Thy vapoury pulse is felt on farthest strands! Thou tirest not, complainest not—though blind As human pride (earth's lowest dust) art thou. Child of pale thought! dread masterpiece of mind! I read nor thought nor passion on thy brow! To-morrow thou wilt labour, deaf as now! And must we say “that soul is wanting here?” VII. No; there he moves, the thoughtful engineer, The soul of all this motion; rule in hand, And coarsely apron'd—simple, plain, sincere— An honest man; self-taught to understand The useful wonders which he built and plann'd. Self-taught to read and write—a poor man's son, Though poor no more—how would he sit alone, When the hard labour of the day was done, Bent o'er his table, silent as a stone, To make the wisdom of the wise his own! How oft of Brindley's deeds th' apprenticed boy Would speak delighted, long ere freedom came! And talk of Watt! while, shedding tears of joy, His widow'd mother heard, and hoped the name Of her poor boy, like theirs, would rise to fame. Was not her love prophetic? Is he famed? Yea; for deep foresight, and improving skill, And patience, which might make the proud ashamed. Built by himself, lo! yonder, from the hill His dwelling peeps!—and she is with him still; Happy to live, and well prepared to die! VIII. How unlike him is Grip, the upstart sly, Who on the dunghill, whence he lately rose, Lost his large organ of identity, And left his sire to starve! Alas, he knows No poor man now! But every day he goes To visit his nine acres, pitiless Of him who tills the road, that shoeless boor Who feeds his brother exile in distress. Hark! muttering oaths, he wonders why our poor Are not all Irish! Eyeing, then, the moor, He swears, if he were king, what he would do! Our corn-importing rogues should have a fall; For he would plough the rocks, and trench them too. And then of bloody papists doth he bawl; If he were king, he'd (damn them!) shoot them all. And then he quotes the Duke! and sagely thinks That princes should be loyal to the throne. And then he talks of privilege—and winks: Game he can't eat, he hints; but kills his own. And then he calls the land a marrow bone, Which tradesmen suck; for he no longer trades, But talks of traffic with defensive sneer. Full deeply is he learn'd in modes and grades, And condescends to think my Lord his peer! Yet, lo! he noddeth at the engineer— Grins at the “fellow”—grunts—and lounges on! THE RANTER. To John Bowring, Esq., one of our steadiest Champions of Liberty, Civil and Religious—whose Translations have enabled us to shake hands with Brethren whom we knew not; the Living, who to us were dead; and the Dead, who cannot die— this Poem is dedicated, by his obliged and thankful Friend, the Author. I. Miles Gordon sleeps; his six days' labour done, He dreams of Sunday, verdant fields, and prayer: O rise, bless'd morn, unclouded! Let thy sun Shine on the artisan—thy purest air Breathe on the bread-tax'd labourer's deep despair! Poor sons of toil! I grudge them not the breeze That plays with Sabbath flowers, the clouds that play With Sabbath winds, the hum of Sabbath bees, The Sabbath walk, the skylark's Sabbath lay, The silent sunshine of the Sabbath day. II. The stars wax pale, the moon is cold and dim; Miles Gordon wakes, and grey dawn tints the skies: The many-childed widow, who to him Is as a mother, hears her lodger rise, And listens to his prayer with swimming eyes. For her and for her orphans poor he prays, For all who earn the bread they daily eat:— “Bless them, O God, with useful, happy days, With hearts that scorn all meanness and deceit; And round their lowly hearths let freemen meet!”— This morn, betimes, she hastes to leave her bed, For he must preach beneath th' autumnal tree: She lights her fire, and soon the board is spread With Sabbath coffee, toast, and cups for three. Pale he descends; again she starts to see His hollow cheek, and feels they soon must part! But they shall meet again—that hope is sure; And, oh! she venerates his mind and heart, For he is pure, if mortal e'er was pure! His words, his silence, teach her to endure! And then he helps to feed her orphan'd five! O God! thy judgments cruel seem to be! While bad men biggen long, and cursing thrive, The good, like wintry sunbeams, fade and flee— That we may follow them, and come to thee. III. In haste she turns, and climbs the narrow stair, To wake her eldest born, but, pausing, stands Bent o'er his bed; for on his forehead bare, Like jewels ring'd on sleeping beauty's hands, Tired labour's gems are set in beaded bands; And none, none, none, like bread-tax'd labour know'th How more than grateful are his slumbers brief. Thou dost not know, thou pamper'd son of sloth! Thou canst not tell, thou bread-tax-eating thief! How sweet is rest to bread-tax'd toil and grief. Like sculpture, or like death, serene he lies. But, no, that tear is not a marble tear! He names, in sleep, his father's injuries; And now, in silence, wears a smile severe. How like his sire he looks, when drawing near His journey's close, and that fair form bent o'er His darkening cheek, still faintly tinged with red, And fondly gazed—too soon to gaze no more!— While her long tresses, o'er the seeming dead, Stream'd in their black profusion, from the head Of matron loveliness—more touchingly, More sadly beautiful, and pale, and still— A shape of half-divine humanity, Worthy of Chantrey's steel, or Milton's quill, Or heaven-taught Raphael's soul-expressing skill! And must she wake that poor o'er-labour'd youth? Oh, yes, or Edmund will his mother chide; For he, this morn, would hear the words of truth From lips inspired, on Shirecliffe's lofty side, Gazing o'er tree and tower on Hallam wide. Up, sluggards, up! the mountains one by one, Ascend in light; and slow the mists retire From vale and plain. The cloud on Stannington Beholds a rocket—No, 'tis Morthen spire! The sun is risen! cries Stanedge, tipp'd with fire; On Norwood's flowers the dew-drops shine and shake; Up, sluggards, up! and drink the morning breeze. The birds on cloud-left Osgathorpe awake; And Wincobank is waving all his trees O'er subject towns, and farms, and villages, And gleaming streams, and wood, and waterfalls. Up! climb the oak-crown'd summit! Hoober Stand And Keppel's Pillar gaze on Wentworth's halls, And misty lakes, that brighten and expand, And distant hills, that watch the western strand. Up! trace God's foot-prints, where they paint the mould With heavenly green, and hues that blush and glow Like angel's wings; while skies of blue and gold Stoop to Miles Gordon on the mountain's brow. Behold the Great Unpaid! the prophet, lo! Sublime he stands beneath the Gospel tree, And Edmund stands on Shirecliffe at his side; Behind him, sinks, and swells, and spreads a sea Of hills, and vales, and groves; before him glide Don, Rivelin, Loxley, wandering in their pride From heights that mix their azure with the cloud; Beneath him, spire and dome are glittering; And round him press his flock, a woe-worn crowd. To other words, while forest echoes ring, “Ye banks and braes o' bonny Doon,” they sing; And, far below, the drover, with a start Awaking, listens to the well-known strain, Which brings Shihallian's shadow to his heart, And Scotia's loneliest vales; then sleeps again, And dreams, on Loxley's banks, of Dunsinane. The hymn they sing is to their preacher dear; It breathes of hopes and glories grand and vast, While on his face they look, with grief and fear; Full well they know his sands are ebbing fast; But, hark! he speaks, and feels he speaks his last!— IV. “‘Woe be unto you, scribes and pharisees, Who eat the widow's and the orphan's bread, And make long prayers to hide your villanies,’ Said He who had not where to lay his head; And wandering forth, while blew the Sabbath breeze, Pluck'd ears of corn, with humble men, like these. God blames not him who toils six days in seven, Where smoke and dust bedim the golden day, If he delight, beneath the dome of heaven, To hear the winds, and see the clouds at play, Or climb his hills, amid their flowers to pray. Ask ye if I, of Wesley's followers one, Abjure the house where Wesleyans bend the knee? I do—because the spirit thence is gone; And truth, and faith, and grace, are not, with me, The Hundred Popes of England's Jesuitry. We hate not the religion of bare walls; We scorn not the cathedral'd pomp of prayer; For sweet are all our Father's festivals, If contrite hearts the heavenly banquet share, In field or temple: God is everywhere! But we hate arrogance and selfishness, Come where they may, and most beneath the roof Sacred to public worship. We profess No love for him who feels no self-reproof When in God's house he stands from God aloof; Nor worship we grim Mars the homicide: Our prayers are not for slaughter; we behold With scorn sectarian and prelatic pride— Slaves, if not bought, too willing to be sold; Christians misnamed, whose gods are blood and gold. What are the deeds of men called Christian, now? They roll themselves in dust before the great; Wherever Mammon builds a shrine, they bow, And would nail Jesus to their cross of hate, Should He again appear in mean estate. Pleasant, repaid by splendid beauty's smile, Praised by the proud, to flatter power and pride And prate of independence all the while; Pleasant and safe, down sunny streams to glide; But virtue fronts the blast, and breasts the tide. Where are their ‘protests,’ monthly, weekly made, Against Abaddon's Corn-Law, and his sword? Where their petitions for unfetter'd trade? Where their recorded execrations pour'd On blood-stain'd tyrants, and the servile horde? When earth wept blood, that wolves might lap and swill, And pleading mercy was a trampled worm, Basely they pander'd to the slayer's will; And still their spells they mutter in the storm, Retarding long the march of slow reform. When palaced paupers, sneering, beard the town, They preach the bread-tax in a text like this, No text more plain—‘To Cæsar give his own!’ Ah, Serviles, dev'lishly the mark they miss, And give to Cæsar ours, not theirs nor his. What said the blushing saints, when Britain's name Brought blushes to all else, o'er every sea, And Lowe, Reade, Bathurst, names of deathless fame, Engraved on hers their immortality? Oh, we were great, magnanimous, and free, And pillage-purchased—yet unsold, unbought; Bread-tax'd, and Peterloo'd, and parish paid, And Cadi-Dervised—therefore most devout; Unplunder'd, undegraded, unbetray'd, And Sidmouth'd, Oliver'd, and Castlereagh'd!— Pious they are, cool, circumspect, severe; And while they feel for woes beyond the wave, They laud the tyrants who starve millions here: The famish'd Briton must be fool or knave, But wrongs are precious in a foreign slave. Their Bibles for the heathen load our fleets; Lo! gloating eastward, they inquire, ‘What news?’ ‘We die,’ we answer, ‘foodless, in the streets,’ And what reply your men of Gospel-views? Oh, ‘they are sending bacon to the Jews!’ Their lofty souls have telescopic eyes, Which see the smallest speck of distant pain, While, at their feet, a world of agonies, Unseen, unheard, unheeded, writhes in vain. Yet thou, O God! withhold'st thy sulphurous rain! Or, if it fall, it blasts the labour'd vale, And spares the barren summit! Lord! how long! Shall freedom's struggles turn the good man pale, And, like a vile apology for wrong, Add to the torturing scourge another thong? O for a Saint, like those who sought and found, For conscience' sake, sad homes beyond the main! The Fathers of New England, who unbound, In wild Columbia, Europe's double chain; The men whose dust cries, ‘Sparta, live again!’ The slander'd Calvinists of Charles's time Fought (and they won it) Freedom's holy fight. Like prophet-bards, although they hated rhyme, All incorruptible as heaven's own light, Spoke each devoted preacher for the right. No servile doctrines, such as power approves, They to the poor and broken-hearted taught; With truths that tyrants dread, and conscience loves, They wing'd and barb'd the arrows of their thought; Sin in high places was the mark they sought; They said not, ‘Man be circumspect and thrive! Be mean, base, slavish, bloody,—and prevail!’ Nor doth the Deity they worshipp'd drive His four-in-hand, applaud a smutty tale, Send Members to the House, and us to gaol. With zeal they preach'd, with reverence they were heard; For in their daring creed, sublime, sincere, Danger was found, that parson-hated word! They flatter'd none—they knew nor hate nor fear, But taught the will of God—and did it here. Even as the fire-wing'd thunder rends the cloud, Their spoken lightnings, dazzling all the land, Abash'd the foreheads of the great and proud, Still'd faction's roar, as by a god's command, And meeken'd Cromwell of the iron hand. V. “Now look beneath, where tax-bought horses draw The Cadi amateur—a devotee For drum-head justice famed, and parlour law! Hater evangelized of liberty! How worthy him who died on Calvary, The Great Reformer, Christ! Who does not loathe His loathsome loathing of all liberal taint! Which of you hath not toil'd to feed and clothe His lackeys? O for Hogarth's hand, to paint His mental lineaments of beast and saint, His Corn-Law scowl, and landed length of ears! Dost thou, thus early, mighty Lord, repair To yonder fane? 'Tis well. Go, and in tears Kneel, holy wretch, although the Sabbath air, Is weary of thy long unpunish'd prayer. Thou, who with hellish zeal, wast drunk and blind When tyrants, cloven-hoof'd in heart and brain, Made murder pastime, and the tardy wind Bore fresh glad tidings o'er the groaning main Of hecatombs on Moloch's altar slain! Kneel, Saint of Carnage!—kneel, but not to Baal; Kneel, but alone, with none to laud thy zeal; For the hour cometh when the reed shall fail On which the wicked lean. But wherefore kneel? Can the worn stone repent, and weep, and feel? Still harder granite forms the bosom-core Of him who laugh'd when freedom's thousands fell. Hark, 'tis the voice, that erst of battle's roar Was wont too oft from yonder tower to tell, Pealing, at thy command, o'er crash and yell, And fiend-like faces, reddening in the light Of streets, that crimson'd midnight with their glare, When England hired the hell-hounds of the fight, Because men broke, in their sublime despair, The bonds which nature could no longer bear! Hark, 'tis the iron voice! and still to thee It speaks of death. Perchance, some child of clay, Some woe-worn thrall of long iniquity, Some drudge, whose mate can yet afford to pay For decent pray'rs, treading the gloomy way Which all must tread, is gone to her long rest, And last account—a dread one thine will be! Of means atrocious, used for ends unbless'd! And joy—for what? For guilty victory; States bought and sold by fraud to tyranny; Slaves arm'd to kill; the free by slaves enslaved; Red havoc's carnival from shore to shore; Sons slaughter'd, widows childless, realms depraved; And Britain's treasures pour'd in seas of gore, Till lords ask alms, and fiercely growl for more! Yes, when your country is one vast disease, And failing fortunes sadden every door— These, O ye quacks! these are your remedies; Alms for the rich!—a bread-tax for the poor! Soul-purchased harvest on the indignant moor! Thus the wing'd victor of a hundred fights, The warrior ship, bows low her banner'd head, When through her planks the sea-born reptile bites Its deadly way—and sinks in ocean's bed, Vanquish'd by worms. ‘What then? The worms were fed.’ Will not God smite thee black, thou whited wall? Thy life is lawless, and thy law a lie, Or nature is a dream unnatural. Look on the clouds, the streams, the earth, the sky: Lo, all is interchange and harmony! Where is the gorgeous pomp which, yester morn, Curtain'd yon orb with amber, fold on fold? Behold it in the blue of Rivelin, borne To feed the all-feeding seas! the molten gold Is flowing pale in Loxley's crystal cold, To kindle into beauty tree and flower, And wake to verdant life hill, vale, and plain. Cloud trades with rivers, and exchange is power: But should the clouds, the streams, the winds disdain Harmonious intercourse, nor dew nor rain Would forest-crown the mountains; airless day Would blast, on Kinderscout, the heathy glow; No purply green would meeken into grey, O'er Don at eve; no sound of river's flow Disturb the sepulchre of all below. VI. “O for a ship—a ship!—the wing of steam! To bear us from the land where toil, despised, Is robb'd and scourged, and life's best prospects seem Sad as the couch of patience agonized! Is there no land where useful men are prized By those they feed? Or will there never be For hope a refuge and a dwelling-place, Where tyrants, in their mad rapacity, Shake not their clench'd fists in the Almighty's face, And cry—‘Thou fool!’—Shall glorious seas embrace A thousand shores in vain? Shall paupers grow Where he hath said the eagle's young shall feed? Shall hopeless tears to water deserts flow, While flow his mighty streams, with none to heed, And make fertility a baneful weed? Poor bread-tax'd slaves, have ye no hope on earth? Yes, God from evil still educes good; Sublime events are rushing to their birth; Lo, tyrants by their victims are withstood! And Freedom's seed still grows, though steep'd in blood! When by our Father's voice the skies are riven, That, like the winnow'd chaff, disease may fly; And seas are shaken by the breath of heaven, Lest in their depths the living spirit die; Man views the scene with awed but grateful eye, And trembling feels, could God abuse his power, Nor man, nor nature, would endure an hour. But there is mercy in his seeming wrath; It smites to save—not, tyrant-like, to slay; And storms have beauty, as the lily hath: Grand are the clouds that, mirror'd on the bay, Roll, like the shadows of lost worlds, away, When bursts through broken gloom the startled light; Grand are the waves that, like that broken gloom, Are smitten into splendour by his might; And glorious is the storm's tremendous boom, Although it waileth o'er a watery tomb, And is a dreadful ode on ocean's drown'd. Despond not, then, ye plunder'd sons of trade! Hope's wounded wing shall yet disdain the ground, And Commerce, while the powers of evil fade, Shout o'er all seas—‘All lands for me were made!’ Hers are the apostles destined to go forth Upon the wings of mighty winds, and preach Christ crucified! To her the south and north Look through their tempests; and her lore shall reach Their farthest ice, if life be there to teach. Yes, world-reforming Commerce! one by one Thou vanquishest earth's tyrants! and the hour Cometh when all shall fall before thee—gone Their splendour, fall'n their trophies, lost their power. Then o'er th' enfranchised nations wilt thou shower Like dew-drops from the pinions of the dove, Plenty and peace; and never more on thee Shall bondage wait; but, as the thoughts of love, Free shalt thou fly, unchainable and free; And men, thenceforth, shall call thee ‘Liberty!’ VII. “Farewell, my friends! we part, no more to meet As trampled worms; but we shall meet again At God's right hand, and our Redeemer's feet! And oft—how oft!—meantime, your solemn strain Shall roll from Shirecliffe's side, o'er vale and plain. O keep the seventh day holy, wheresoe'er Ye be, poor sons of toil! sell not to those Who sold your freedom, sell not for a sneer Your day of rest; but worship God, where glows The flame-tipp'd spire, or blooms the wild wood-rose. Hallow this day to gladness! for, behold, The spoilers watch to steal your Sabbath too! Shall seven days' toil for six days' bread be sold? Forget not yet land-butcher'd Peterloo! Are ye not bread-tax'd? What they did they do, And then most treacherous when they holiest seem, At your salvation here take deadliest aim. O trust them not! but henceforth rightly deem Of sordid fiends, who murder hope and shame, And for a bread-tax, wrapp'd the world in flame. Nor marvel if, athwart the exulting seas, A steam-highway bring soon to their firesides War, and its long inflicted miseries, To plough them with the plough which havoc guides, Despite their wide-wing'd sway o'er winds and tides. Meantime, like wolves full gorged, they lick their jaws, And, sick of prey, roll wide their eyes for more; But from their black and crime-distended maws Eject not yet the clotted gold and gore, The price of souls, death-freed on many a shore.” VIII. He ceased—but still, while young and old retired, Beneath th' autumnal tree, and concave blue, Stood, like the statue of a man inspired! And many an eye turn'd fondly back, to view His face, more saint-like than e'er pencil drew. Then gush'd his tears. He cast a lingering look On farthest moors—dear scenes, remember'd well! And thought of that lone church and verdant nook Where sleeps his mother, in the Alpine dell. “I am alone,” he said—and sigh'd “Farewell!” Alone—but, oh, not unbeloved thou art! Nor undeplored, Miles Gordon, shalt thou sleep In death's cold arms. Full many a manly heart Shall weep o'er thee; the orphan'd five shall weep; The mother of the fatherless shall steep Thy shroud in tears—such tears as mothers shed! Nor shall the patriot bard refuse to pay Melodious honours to the patriot dead, And write above his narrow house of clay, That all, save righteous deeds, must pass away. But shall they lay thy bones, O desert-born, Where no wild bird hears infant rivers flow? Oh, not beneath that cloud, which night would scorn, Not in vile earth, where flowers refuse to grow, And vanity, in sables, mimics woe; Not in yon rank churchyard, where buried lie Tyrant and slave, polluting still the air; But where the rude heath hears the plover cry, And swings the chainless cloud o'er summits bare; There shouldst thou rest—thy heart was ever there! There shouldst thou rest, beneath the mountain wind, Far from the pauper's grave, the despot's door; Though few would seek thy home, and fewer find Thy brief inscription on the shadow'd moor:— “Here lies the preacher of the plunder'd poor.” CORN-LAW RHYMES. To all who revere the Memory of Jeremy Bentham, our second Locke, and wish to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number for the greatest length of time, I inscribe these “Corn-Law Rhymes.” SONG. [Where the poor cease to pay] Tune—“The Land o' the Leal.” Where the poor cease to pay, Go, loved one, and rest! Thou art wearing away To the land of the blest. Our father is gone Where the wrong'd are forgiven, And that dearest one, Thy husband, in heaven. No toil in despair, No tyrant, no slave, No bread-tax is there, With a maw like the grave. But the poacher, thy pride, Whelm'd in ocean afar; And his brother, who died Land-butcher'd in war; And their mother, who sank Broken-hearted to rest; And the baby, that drank 'Till it froze on her breast; With tears, and with smiles, Are waiting for thee, In the beautiful isles Where the wrong'd are the free. Go, loved one, and rest Where the poor cease to pay! To the land of the blest Thou art wearing away; But the son of thy pain Will yet stay with me, And poor little Jane Look sadly like thee. SONG. [Child, is thy father dead?] Tune—“Robin Adair.” Child, is thy father dead? Father is gone! Why did they tax his bread? God's will be done! Mother has sold her bed; Better to die than wed! Where shall she lay her head? Home we have none! Father clamm'd thrice a week— God's will be done! Long for work did he seek, Work he found none. Tears on his hollow cheek Told what no tongue could speak: Why did his master break? God's will be done! Doctor said air was best— Food we had none; Father, with panting breast, Groan'd to be gone: Now he is with the blest— Mother says death is best! We have no place of rest— Yes, ye have one! THE DEATH FEAST. The birth-day, or the wedding-day, Let happier mourners keep: To Death my vestal vows I pay, And try in vain to weep. Some griefs the strongest soul might shake, And I such griefs have had; My brain is hot—but they mistake Who deem that I am mad. My father died—my mother died— Four orphans poor were we; My brother John work'd hard, and tried To smile on Jane and me. But work grew scarce, while bread grew dear, And wages lessen'd too; For Irish hordes were bidders here, Our half-paid work to do. Yet still he strove, with failing breath And sinking cheek, to save Consumptive Jane from early death— Then join'd her in the grave. His watery hand in mine I took, And kiss'd him till he slept; Oh, still I see his dying look! He tried to smile, and wept! I bought his coffin with my bed, My gown bought earth and prayer; I pawn'd my mother's ring for bread— I pawn'd my father's chair. My Bible yet remains to sell, And yet unsold shall be; But language fails my woes to tell— Even crumbs were scarce with me. I sold poor Jane's grey linnet then— It cost a groat a-year; I sold John's hen—and miss'd the hen, When eggs were selling dear: For autumn nights seem'd wintry cold, While seldom blazed my fire; And eight times eight no more I sold When eggs were getting higher. But still I glean the moor and heath; I wash, they say, with skill; And Workhouse bread ne'er cross'd my teeth— I trust it never will. But when the day on which John died Returns with all its gloom, I seek kind friends, and beg, with pride, A banquet for the tomb. One friend, my brother James, at least, Comes then with me to dine; Let others keep the marriage-feast, The funeral feast is mine. For then on them I fondly call, And then they live again! To-morrow is our festival Of Death, and John, and Jane. E'en now, behold! they look on me, Exulting from the skies, While angels round them weep to see The tears gush from their eyes! I cannot weep—why can I not? My tears refuse to flow: My feet are cold—my brain is hot— Is fever madness?—No. Thou smilest, and in scorn—but thou, Couldst thou forget the dead? No common beggar courtsies now, And begs for burial bread. ELEGY. O Huskisson! O Huskisson! O Huskisson, in vain our friend! Why hast thou left thy work undone? Of good begun is this the end? Thou should'st have lived, if they remain Who fetter'd us, and hated thee. O Huskisson, our friend in vain! Where now are hope and liberty? Thou should'st have lived, if with thee dies The poor man's hope of better days. Time stops to weep, but yet shall rise The sun whose beams shall write thy praise. The widow weeps—but what is she, And what her paltry common woe? Worlds weep—and millions fast for thee. Our hope is gone! why didst thou go? Pleased hell awhile suspends his breath, Then shouts in joy, and laughs in hate; And plague and famine call on death Their jubilee to celebrate. A shadow bids improvement stand, While faster flow a nation's tears. O dead man! with thy pallid hand, Thou rollest back the tide of years! THE RECORDING ANGEL. I. I am not death, O King! nor by him sent O'er thy sad heart my pinions black to wave; But, when men die, I stand, in silence bent, Writing the deeds of warrior, saint, or slave, And canonize the timid and the brave. They die, but after them their actions live, For good or ill. Speak, then, if thou wouldst be, Though bad, not worst; and mercy may forgive The cureless past. What shall I write of thee? Shall toil be plunder'd still—or trade be free? Know'st thou the law by which Kings govern well, The golden law—“Reign not for some but all?” Shall I to men, and to the immortals tell That thou didst fetter hope, or disenthrall? O answer, ere the fatal curtain fall! To-morrow, and the Sultan is forgot Even in the harem; but on realms oppress'd The scar remains, where pass'd the iron hot With which he sear'd them; and wrongs unredress'd Cry to the hopeless dead—“Ye shall not rest!” Would'st thou be mourn'd with curses or with tears? As angels mourn the blow that casts aside The axle of a world, for years and years Turning the seasons back, and all their pride? Or as men mourn a godlike friend who died? Thou hast, men say, for misery's tear a sigh; But if thy heart is warm, 'tis warm in vain. King of the Bread-Tax! dearly did'st thou buy That title. Shall it evermore remain To mock thy virtues, an eternal stain? II. No answer?—Oft the meanest of mankind, Gay as “The Tenth,” and polish'd as their swords, Have rivall'd Nash in etiquette of mind, And all the littleness of forms and words; But thou art King of Squires, and reign'st for Lords! To teach thy sire, earth wept a sea of gore; He lived unteachable, and died untaught By curses wrung from millions. It is o'er, And thou wast heir of all his madness wrought; Be this thy plea—all else availeth nought. But nations beggar'd, that ye might bequeath Old bonds to France redeem'd! and Peterloo Immortal! and Napoleon's deathless death! These were such deeds as vulgar kings can do; They made thee famous, but not matchless too. King of Dear Corn! Time hears, with ceaseless groan, Time ever hears, sad names of hate and dread: But thou, thou only, of all monarchs known, Didst legislate against thy People's bread! King of the Corn-Laws! thus wilt thou be read! For ever thus. A monarch calls thee—Go: And if there be, in other worlds, a throne That waits a prince unequall'd, be not slow To seize the vacant seat—it is thine own; King of Dear Corn! thou art “thyself alone!” Safe is thy fame. 'Tis come, th' unerring hour That calls even kings to their account away; And o'er thee frowns a shadow and a power To quench the stars, and turn the living day Black. Yoked below, pant Horror and Dismay; The steeds, O King! with soundless speed, that drag Thee, and a king more dreaded than his Lord, The King of Kings—O Death! behold his flag— The wormy shroud! his sceptre, crown, and sword— Worms! his dread slaves—worms, worms that do his word! But where are thine! thy slaves! thy flatterers?—Gone. Nor need'st thou sigh for parasite or sage; For, lo! the mightiest of all kings, but one, (Lord of the dust that once was youth and age,) Attends thee fallen! Behold his equipage! How strange a chariot serves both him and thee! But Death rides royally—no stop, no stay; On, on! far hence thy final home must be. What cloud swings there? A world that turns from day Her mountains. Death drives well—Away! Away! As when to ships, which mists at sea surround, The dangerous fog assumes a golden hue, While rocks draw near with sudden breakers bound, And distant mountains, reeling into view, Lift o'er the clouds their cliffs of airy blue; So, to thy soul, released from mortal ties, Scenes grand, and wild, and terrible, and new, Strange lands, strange seas, the stars of unknown skies— The realms of death with all their hosts arise. King of Dear Corn! the dead have heard that name; They come—imperial spectres throng to meet Him, who, at once, eclipsed their dismal fame. But why should despots long to kiss thy feet? Did Nero starve his People? No—O shame! He only hymn'd the flames that, street by street, Swept Rome, no longer Roman;—it is meet That greatness bow to greatest. Famine's lord! What pallid crowds plebeian round thee rise! Sent to sad graves by human fiends abhorr'd, They come to thank thee with their tears and sighs:— Nay, shrink not from the crowd of hollow eyes! Thou know'st their children live to toil and pine, And that eternity's long roll supplies No nickname, deathless, grand, and just as thine. But who is she, of aspect masculine, Amid the silent moving silently, With saddest step but not unroyal air, And gazing like an injured friend on thee? There is sublimity in her despair! O King! that pitying look is hard to bear! Thee she forgives, but not the havoc made By thy meek servants and most gracious foes, Who sagely interdict, hope, profit, trade. And must thy name be link'd for aye with those— “The triple hundred kinglings”—who oppose All change but evil change; and, deaf and blind, Refute the sun and ocean as he flows? While daily, hourly, in their war on mind, They scourge again the Saviour of mankind. O why didst thou obey them from thy throne? Thou might'st have been, alas! thou would'st not be King of the People! (would that thou had'st known How almost godlike 'tis to rule the free!)— Or lived a tyrant! not the nominee Of tyrants, wallowing in their victims' woe, And arm'd to curse mankind, with worse than stings. Compared with thine, their deeds are night on snow:— The breath of dungeons on a seraph's wings! Derision! who would reign where such are kings? But to be slave—if thou wert willing slave— Of mean barbarians; to be signing clerk Of palaced almoner, and tax-fed knave; To wear their livery, and their badge and mark; To love the light, and yet to choose the dark;— This, this was vile, and did to millions wrong Not to be borne by men who boast a spark Of manly worth. O Tamer of the strong! Wake thy slow angel, God! He slumbers long— His voice of reformation should be heard, His hand be active, not to overturn, But to restore; ere, sick with hope deferr'd, The good despond; ere lord and peasant mourn, Homeless alike; ere Waste and Havoc spurn, With hand and foot, the dust of Power and Pride; While tower and temple at their bidding burn, And the land reels, and rocks from side to side, A sailless wreck, with none to save or guide; A sailless wreck, with multitudes to do Deeds more accursed than pirate's deck e'er saw; A helmless wreck, a famine-frantic crew, All rage and hunger, hand, and voice, and maw; And on that rolling wreck, no food, no hope, no law! THE TREE OF RIVELIN. The lightning, like an Arab, cross'd The moon's dark path on high, And wild on Rivelin writhed and toss'd The stars and troubled sky, Where lone the tree of ages grew, With branches wide and tall; Ah! who, when such a tempest blew, Could hear his stormy fall? But now the skies, the stars are still, The blue wave sleeps again, And heath and moss, by rock and rill, Are whispering, in disdain, That Rivelin's side is desolate, Her giant in the dust! Beware, O Power! for God is great, O Guilt! for God is just! And boast not, Pride! while millions pine, That wealth secures thy home; The storm that shakes all hearths but thine Is not the storm to come. The tremor of the stars is pale, The dead clod quakes with fear, The worm slinks down o'er hill and vale, When God in wrath draws near. But if the Upas will not bend Beneath the frown of Heaven, A whisper cometh, which shall rend What thunder hath not riven. INSCRIPTION, FOR A TABLET IN THE ISLAND OF JUAN FERNANDEZ. Last of a race of giants, lived De Foe, First champion of commercial liberty! Where lie his bones? He died—'tis all we know, Save that he lived and died in penury; And, sorrowing, paid to unrelenting hate That debt which envy ne'er forgives the great. Hampden! De Foe! Cromwell! and Milton! When Shall twenty years boast four such names again?— But which was greatest? Great was he who fell— The rebel Hampden; great and terrible He who well merited the crown he dared; Mighty the novelist; sublime the bard, That blind old man of London! With their deeds The world still rings as age to age succeeds; But which will longest bask in glory's smile? The tale of Paradise—or that of Crusoe's isle? REFORM. Too long endured, a power and will, That would be nought, or first in ill, Had wasted wealth, and palsied skill, And fed on toil-worn poverty. They call'd the poor a rope of sand; And, lo! no rich man's voice or hand Was raised, throughout the suffering land Against their long iniquity. They taught the self-robb'd sons of pride To turn from toil and want aside, And coin their hearts, guilt-petrified, To buy a smile from infamy. The philter'd lion yawn'd in vain, While o'er his eyes, and o'er his mane, They hung a picklock, mask, and chain— True emblems of his dignity. They murder'd Hope, they fetter'd Trade; The clouds to blood, the sun to shade, And every good that God had made They turned to bane and mockery. Love, plant of Heaven, and sent to show One bliss divine to earth below, Changed by their frown, bore crime and woe, And breathed, for fragrance, pestilence. With Freedom's plume, and Honour's gem, They deck'd Abaddon's diadem, And call'd on hell to shout for them, The holiest name of holiness. They knew no interest but their own; They shook the State, they shook the Throne, They shook the world; and God alone Seem'd safe in his omnipotence. Did then his thunder rend the skies, To bid the dead in soul arise?— The dreadful glare of sullen eyes Alone warn'd cruel tyranny! A murmur from a trampled worm, A whisper in the cloudless storm— Yet these, even these, announced Reform; And Famine's scowl was prophecy! Nor then remorse, nor tardy shame, Nor love of praise, nor dread of blame, But tongues of fire, and words of flame, Roused Mammon from his apathy. At length, a MAN to Mercia spoke! Henry Brougham. From smitten hearts the lightning broke; The slow invincible awoke; And England's frown was victory! O years of crime! The great and true— The nobly wise—are still the few, Who bid Truth grow where Falsehood grew, And plant it for eternity! LINES WRITTEN IN AN EDITION OF COLLINS, WITH ETCHINGS BY PLATT. Struck blind in youth, Platt ask'd the proud for bread; He ask'd in vain, and sternly join'd the dead. I saw him weep—“Hail, holy light!” he cried; But living darkness heard him, and he died. Oh, by the light that left too soon his eyes, And bade him starve on ice-cold charities; Doom'd is the wealth that could no pittance spare, To save benighted genius from despair! These etchings, Platt, alone remain of thee! How soon, alas! e'en these will cease to be! But poesy hath flowers that ever bloom; And music, though she seal'd thy cruel doom, The unfortunate artist, having lost his sight, attempted to learn music for subsistence. A concert, which he advertised, failed, and the cup ran over. Shall sing a ballad o'er her pupil's tomb. BATTLE SONG. Day, like our souls, is fiercely dark; What then? 'Tis day! We sleep no more; the cock crows—hark! To arms! away! They come! they come! the knell is rung Of us or them; Wide o'er their march the pomp is flung Of gold and gem. What collar'd hound of lawless sway, To famine dear— What pension'd slave of Attila, Leads in the rear? Come they from Scythian wilds afar, Our blood to spill? Wear they the livery of the Czar? They do his will. Nor tassell'd silk, nor epaulette, Nor plume, nor torse— No splendour gilds, all sternly met, Our foot and horse. But, dark and still, we inly glow, Condensed in ire! Strike, tawdry slaves, and ye shall know Our gloom is fire. In vain your pomp, ye evil powers, Insults the land; Wrongs, vengeance, and the cause are ours, And God's right hand! Madmen! they trample into snakes The wormy clod! Like fire, beneath their feet awakes The sword of God! Behind, before, above, below, They rouse the brave; Where'er they go, they make a foe, Or find a grave. THE REVOLUTION OF 1832. See, the slow Angel writhes in dreams of pain! His cheek indignant glows! Like Stanedge, shaking thunder from his mane, He starts from his repose. Wide, wide, his earthquake-voice is felt and heard; “Arise, ye brave and just!” The living sea is to its centre stirr'd— And, lo! our foes are dust! The earth beneath the feet of millions quakes; The whirlwind-cloud is riv'n; As midnight, smitten into lightning, wakes, So waked the sword of Heav'n. The angel drew not from its sheath that sword; He spake, and all was done! Night fled away before the Almighty word, And, lo!—the sun! the sun! THE TRIUMPH OF REFORM. WRITTEN FOR THE SHEFFIELD POLITICAL UNION. Tune—“Rule Britannia.” When woe-worn France first sternly spread Her banner'd rainbow on the wind; To smite rebellious Reason dead, The kings of many lands combined. Did they triumph? So they deem'd: Could they triumph? No!—They dream'd. From Freedom's ashes at their call A form of might arose, and blazed: 'Tis true they saw the phantom fall; 'Tis true they crush'd the power they raised; But in conflict with the wise, Vain are armies, leagues, and lies. Not Freedom—no! but Freedom's foe, The baffled league of kings o'erthrew; We conquer'd them, though slaves can show They conquer'd us at Waterloo: Mind is mightier than the strong! Right hath triumph'd over wrong! By sordid lusts to ruin led, Come England's foes, ye self-undone! Behold for what ye taxed our bread! Is this the Mont Saint Fean ye won? Hark the rabble's triumph lay!— Sturdy beggars! who are they? Go, call your Czar! hire all his hordes! Arm Cæsar Hardinge! League and plot! Mind smites you with her wing of words, And nought shall be, where mind is not. Crush'd to nothing—what you are— Wormlings! will ye prate of war? No paltry fray, no bloody day, That crowns with praise, the baby-great; The Deed of Brougham, Russell, Grey, The Deed that's done, we celebrate! Mind's great Charter! Europe saved! Man for ever unenslaved! O could the wise, the brave, the just, Who suffer'd—died—to break our chains; Could Muir, could Palmer, from the dust, Could murder'd Gerald hear our strains; Then would martyrs, throned in bliss, See all ages bless'd in this. THE PRESS. WRITTEN FOR THE PRINTERS OF SHEFFIELD, ON THE PASSING OF THE REFORM BILL. God said—“Let there be light!” Grim darkness felt his might, And fled away; Then startled seas and mountains cold Shone forth, all bright in blue and gold, And cried—“'Tis day! 'tis day!” “Hail, holy light!” exclaim'd The thund'rous cloud, that flamed O'er daisies white; And, lo! the rose, in crimson dress'd, Lean'd sweetly on the lily's breast; And, blushing, murmur'd—“Light!” Then was the skylark born; Then rose th' embattled corn; Then floods of praise Flow'd o'er the sunny hills of noon; And then, in stillest night, the moon Pour'd forth her pensive lays. Lo, heaven's bright bow is glad! Lo, trees and flowers all clad In glory, bloom! And shall the mortal sons of God Be senseless as the trodden clod, And darker than the tomb? No, by the mind of man! By the swart artisan! By God, our Sire! Our souls have holy light within, And every form of grief and sin Shall see and feel its fire. By earth, and hell, and heav'n, The shroud of souls is riven! Mind, mind alone Is light, and hope, and life, and power! Earth's deepest night, from this bless'd hour, The night of minds is gone! “The Press!” all lands shall sing; The Press, the Press we bring, All lands to bless: O pallid Want! O Labour stark! Behold, we bring the second ark! The Press! the Press! the Press! THE EMIGRANT'S FAREWELL. England, farewell! we quit thee—never more To drink thy dewy light, or hear the thrush Sing to thy fountain'd vales. Farewell! thy shore Sinks—it is gone! and in our souls the rush Of billows soundeth, like the crash and crush Of hope and life. No land! all sky and sea! For ever then farewell! But may we blush To hear thy language, if thy wrongs or thee Our hearts forget, where screams o'er rock and tree The Washingtonian eagle! In our prayers, If we forget our wrongers, may we be Vile as their virtues, hopeless as their heirs, And sires of sons whom scorn shall nickname theirs!— And to such wolves leave we our country? Oh The heart that quits thee, e'en in hope, despairs! Yet from our fathers' graves thy children go To houseless wilds, where nameless rivers flow, Lest, when our children pass our graves, they hear The clank of chains, and shrieks of servile woe From coward bones, that, e'en though lifeless, fear Cold Rapine's icy fang, cold Havock's dastard spear. A POET'S PRAYER. Almighty Father! let thy lowly child, Strong in his love of truth, be wisely bold— A patriot bard, by sycophants reviled, Let him live usefully, and not die old! Let poor men's children, pleased to read his lays, Love, for his sake, the scenes where he hath been; And, when he ends his pilgrimage of days, Let him be buried where the grass is green; Where daisies, blooming earliest, linger late To hear the bee his busy note prolong— There let him slumber, and in peace await The dawning morn, far from the sensual throng, Who scorn the windflower's blush, the redbreast's lonely song. WIN-HILL; The central mountain—not the highest—of the Peak of Derbyshire. OR, THE CURSE OF GOD. To Francis Place, Esq., author of “Illustrations of the Principle of Population,” I respectfully dedicate this Poem. This day, ye mountains! is a holiday; Not the bless'd Sabbath, yet a day of rest, Though wrung by cant from sordid men, who pay Their homage to the god whom cant loves best: I hallow it to Heaven, and make it bless'd. Wild Moscar Dell, receive me! headlong Wye, Let my soul hear thee from the mountain's breast, Telling thy streamlets, as they leap from high, That richer, lovelier vales, and nobler hills, are nigh! Now quit thy home, thou bread-tax'd Artisan! Drink air and light, pale victim, while thou may'st! What dost thou hence, umbrella'd Englishman, Bound to thy pagod in the streeted waste? Deem'st thou that God dwells only where thou pray'st? Come worship here, while clouds the hill-tops kiss! Death numbereth them who linger where thou stay'st, Bliss-praying supplicant! why shunn'st thou bliss? O can ye hope for heaven, and scorn a scene like this? Thy sisters, in the vales left far behind, Are dead, late-coming Primrose! months ago, They faded slowly in the pensive wind: Thou smilest—yes, the happy will do so, Careless of others' wrongs, and others' woe. Carnation'd childhood's favourite! thou too here? Ay, roses die, but daisies always grow. Skeleton ash! why lag behind the year? Where Don and Rother meet, no half-clad boughs appear. Nor there are children of the young year seen; But tawdry flowers flaunt where they grew, and tell How soon they died! even as the base and mean Laugh o'er a good man's grave. But near the well That never fails, the golden pimpernel Enjoys the freshness of this Alpine clime; And violets linger in each deep cool dell, As lowly virtues of the olden time Cling to their cottage-homes, and slowly yield to crime. Last windflower! knew'st thou April? Infant June Sees thee, and reddens at thy modest smile; And o'er thee still May's chaffinch sings his tune, Well-pleased thy musing idlesse to beguile, Where two streams meet beneath thy lonely isle; And cottony bog-rush, and the antler'd moss, And the brake's lady The Ladysmock, Rousseau's flower. cluster round thee, while Their heads at thee the rising foxgloves toss, Where gnarl'd and lichen'd oaks the shadow'd torrent cross. So bad men frown! but can their frowns compel The cowslip to remain beneath the sod? Can they prevent the mosses of the dell From lifting up their tiny hands to God? No; to the soul these point its far abode, And humbly tell us what the angels are; Immortal flowers! as dewdrops on the sod Pure; or the beams that hymn, from star to star, The King who paves with suns his wheelless, noiseless car. O thou great Scotsman, with the meteor-pen! Come from thy Trosachs, Wilson, The author of “The City of the Plague.” come, and paint Yon monarch of our Alps! that little men May feel thy Titan soul in theirs, and faint Almost with inspiration; from the taint Of worldly vileness freed, as by a spell; And made, at once, half-prophet and half-saint, When reading thee to town-sick hearts, they tell Of scenes few love like thee, and none can paint so well. How wildly start the wild flocks as we gaze! How softly sleeps upon the lap of noon The cloud-couch'd lightning! and how sweetly plays The laughing blue above the blackness; soon To melt in fire and horror, where, aboon This lesser giant's storm-swoll'n floods and firs, Yon distant giant fronts the mid-day moon, While solemnly the wind-fed wigan The Mountain-ash. stirs Its flapping leaves alone, o'er fern and sun-bright furze! To bathe with married waves their monarch's feet, See, where the Ashop and the Derwent haste; And how he rears him from the vale, complete In all his time-touch'd majesty, embraced By the blue, bright blue heavens; his proud brow graced With that stone diadem which Nature made, Ages before her practised hand had graced With living gems the bluebell-haunted shade; Or, high in lucid air, her wind-swift wings display'd! King of the Peak! Win-Hill! thou, throned and crown'd, That reign'st o'er many a stream and many a vale! Star-loved, and meteor-sought, and tempest-found! Proud centre of a mountain-circle, hail! The might of man may triumph or may fail; But, Eldest Brother of the Air and Light, Firm shalt thou stand when demigods turn pale! For thou, ere Science dawn'd on Reason's night, Wast, and wilt be when Mind shall rule all other might. To be a crown'd and sceptred curse, that makes Immortals worms! a wolf, that feeds on souls! One of the names which vengeance whips with snakes, Whose vemon cannot die! a king of ghouls, Whose drink is blood! To be clear-eyed as owls, Still calling darkness light, and winter spring! To be a tiger-king, whose mercy growls! To be of meanest things the vilest thing! Throned asp o'er lesser asps! What grub would be a king? But, crown'd Win-Hill! to be a king like thee! Older than death! as God's thy calm behest! Only heaven-rivall'd in thy royalty! Calling the feeble to thy sheltering breast, And shaking beauty from thy gorgeous vest, And loved by every good and happy thing! With nought beneath thee that thou hast not bless'd, And nought above thee but the Almighty's wing! O glorious god-like aim! Who would not be a king? But, lo, the Inn! the mountain-girded Inn! Whose amber stream is worth all Helicon! To pass it fasting were a shame and sin; Stop! for the gate hangs well that hinders none; Refresh, and pay, then stoutly travel on! Ay, thou hast need to pree the barley-wine; Steep is th' ascent, O bard! thou look'st upon; To reach that cloud-capt seat, and throne divine, Might try a stronger frame and younger limbs than thine. Now, having drunk of jolly ale enough, To climb Win-Hill is worth ambition—yea! Ambition, e'en if made of jolly stuff, Should drink strong ale, or never will he say To rival climbers—“Follow on my way!” Old ale and jolly, be it dark or pale, Drink like a toper, be thou green or grey! Drink oft and long, or try to climb, and fail! If thou would'st climb Win-Hill, drink old and jolly ale! See our old song—“Back and Sides go Bare.” “Blow, blow, thou breeze of mountain freshness, blow!” Stronger and fresher still, as we ascend Strengthen'd and freshen'd, till the land below Lies like a map!—On! on! those clouds portend Hail, rain, and fire! — Hark, how the rivers send Their skyward voices hither, and their words Of liquid music!—See, how bluely blend The east moors with the sky!—The lowing herds, To us, are silent now, and hush'd the songful birds. This spot is hallow'd; sacred are these rocks, To death and sorrow. Here, amid the snow, A stranger died, A few years ago, a human skeleton was found near the summit of this mountain, and removed to the churchyard of the village of Hope, where it remains, uncoffined and uninterred.—Hallamshire and Derbyshire Magazine. where seldom the wild flocks Ascend to feed. Clouds! for ye only know His griefs and wrongs, tell me his name of woe, The mutter'd history of his broken heart; That of a thing so noble we may owe To you a relic, never to depart— A tale o'er which proud men may sometimes pause and start! From the hard world that scorn'd to scorn him, he Retired, to die in solitude, as dies The royal eagle in his majesty, Where no mean bird may peck his fading eyes; And told the mournful winds, with tears and sighs, That so fall'n man should ever die, alone And undegraded. O'er his cheek the skies, Stooping in pity, wept to hear him groan, And drown'd in faithful tears his soul's last lowbreathed moan. Nor other tears for him were ever shed, Except by her who, dying, to her breast Clasp'd him, her child, and mourn'd his father dead; And kiss'd and kiss'd that babe, and bless'd and bless'd The orphan'd worm that suck'd her into rest; And still, almost with hope her grief beguiled, And tried to pray, till death her eyeballs press'd— But could not pray, amid her ravings wild, That God would take the life she gave to that poor child? He died; but still the winds that loved him came And whisper'd, though he made them no reply; And still his friends, the clouds, bedew'd his frame With frozen tears, less cold than charity. But little men, whom summer brought to see The heathcock's plumes, beheld him where he lay, And robb'd him of that glorious tomb, which he Chose in his pride; bearing his bones away— His proud, insulted bones—to mix with common clay. And I will not loathe man—although he be Adder and tiger!—for his sake who died Here, in his desolation great and free, And with a fall'n immortal's might and pride, On human nature's dignity relied, When all else failed. No workhouse menial's blows Check'd his last sob! No packthread-mockery tied His sunken chin! Oh, sick of mortal woes, I bless the pillow which his Hampden-spirit chose! High on the topmost jewel of thy crown, Win-Hill! I sit bareheaded, ankle-deep In tufts of rose-cupp'd bilberries; and look down On towns that smoke below, and homes that creep Into the silvery clouds, which far-off keep Their sultry state! and many a mountain stream, And many a mountain vale, “and ridgy steep;” The Peak, and all his mountains, where they gleam Or frown, remote or near, more distant than they seem! There flows the Ashop, yonder bounds the Wye, And Derwent here towards princely Chatsworth trends; But, while the Nough steals purple from the sky, Lo! northward far, what giant's shadow bends? A voice of torrents, hark! its wailing sends; Who drives yon tortured cloud through stone-still air? A rush! a roar! a wing! a whirlwind rends The stooping larch! The moorlands cry “Prepare! It comes! ye gore-gorged foes of want and toil, beware!” It comes! Behold!—Black Blakelow hoists on high His signals to the blast from Gledhill's brow. Them, slowly glooming on the lessening sky, The bread-tax'd exile sees, (in speechless woe, Wandering the melancholy main below, Where round the shores of Man the dark surge heaves,) And while his children's tears in silence flow, Thinks of sweet scenes to which his soul still cleaves, That home on Etherow's side, which he for ever leaves. Now expectation listens, mute and pale, While, ridged with sudden foam, the Derwent brawls; Arrow-like comes the rain, like fire the hail; And, hark! Mam-Tor on shuddering Stanage calls! See, what a frown o'er castled Winnat falls! Down drops the death-black sky! and Kinderscout, Conscious of glory, laughs at intervals; Then lifts his helmet, throws his thunders out, Bathes all the hills in flame, and hails their stormy shout. Hark! how my Titan guards laugh kings to scorn! See, what a fiery circle girds my state! Hail mountains! River-Gatherers! Eldest born Of Time and Nature, dreadful, dark, and great! Whose tempests, wing'd from brows that threaten fate, Cast shadows, blacken'd with intensest light, Like the despair of angels fallen, that wait On God's long-sleeping wrath, till roof'd with night, The seas shall burn like oil, and Death be waked with fright. Storm! could I ride on thee, and grasp thy mane, A bitless bridle, in my unburnt hand; Like flax consumed, should fall the bondman's chain, Like dust, the torturers of each troubled land; And Poland o'er the prostrate Hun should stand— Her foot upon his neck, her falchion's hilt Beneath her ample palm. Then every strand Should hear her voice: “Our bulwark is rebuilt, Europe! but who shall gauge the blood these butchers spilt?” And what are they, O land of age-long woes! Who laid the hope of thy redemption low? Are they not Britain's sons, and Labour's foes, Who, sowing curses, ask why curses grow, And league with fate for their own overthrow? When will their journey end? They travel fast!— Slow Retribution! wherefore art thou slow? When will the night of our despair be past? And bread-tax'd slaves become Men, godlike Men, at last? Thy voice is like thy Father's, dreadful storm! Earth hears his whisper, when thy clouds are torn; And Nature's tremor bids our sister-worm Sink in the ground. But they who laugh to scorn The trampled heart which want and toil have worn, Fear thee, and laugh at Him, whose warning word Speaks from thy clouds, on burning billows borne; For, in their hearts, his voice they never heard, Ne'er felt his chastening hand, nor pined with hope deferr'd. O Thou whose whispering is the thunder! Power Eternal, world-attended, yet alone! O give, at least, to labour's hopeless hour That peace, which Thou deny'st not to a stone! The famine-smitten millions cease to groan; When wilt Thou hear their mute and long despair? Lord, help the poor! for they are all thy own. Wilt Thou not help? did I not hear Thee swear That Thou would'st tame the proud, and grant their victims' prayer? Methought I saw Thee in the dreams of sleep. This mountain, Father, groan'd beneath thy heel! Thy other foot was placed on Kinder's steep; Before thy face I saw the planets reel, While earth and skies shone bright as molten steel; For under all the stars Thou took'st thy stand, And bad'st the ends of heaven behold and feel, That Thou to all thy worlds had'st stretch'd thine hand, And cursed for evermore the Legion-Fiend of Land! “He is accursèd!” said the sons of light, As in their bowers of bliss they listen'd pale; “He is accursèd!” said the comets, bright With joy; and star to star a song of bale Sang, and sun told to sun the dismal tale, “He is accursèd! till the light shall fade To horror in heaven's courts, and glory veil Her beams, before the face of Truth betray'd; Because he cursed the land, which God a blessing made! “He is accursèd!” said the Prince of Hell; And—like a Phidian statue, mountain-vast— Stooping from rocks, black, yet unquenchable, The pale shade of his faded glory cast Over the blackness of black fire, aghast— Black-burning seas, that ever black will burn; “He is accursèd! and while hell shall last, Him and his prayer heaven's marble roof will spurn, Who cursed the blessèd sod, and bade earth's millions mourn!” END OF VOL.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. HYMN WRITTEN FOR THE PRINTERS OF SHEFFIELD. Lord! taught by Thee, when Caxton bade His silent words for ever speak; A grave for tyrants then was made, Then crack'd the chain which yet shall break. For bread, for bread, the all-scorn'd man, With study worn, his press prepared; And knew not, Lord, thy wondrous plan, Nor what he did, nor what he dared. When first the might of deathless thought Impress'd his all-instructing page, Unconscious giant! how he smote The fraud and force of many an age! Pale wax'd the harlot, fear'd of thrones, And they who bought her harlotry: He shook the throned on dead men's bones, He shakes—all evil yet to be! The pow'r He grasp'd let none disdain; It conquer'd once, and conquers still; By fraud and force assail'd in vain, It conquer'd erst, and ever will. It conquers here! the fight is won! We thank thee, Lord, with many a tear! For many a not unworthy son Of Caxton does thy bidding here. We help ourselves, thy cause we aid; We build for Heav'n, beneath the skies: And bless Thee, Lord, that Thou hast made Our daily bread of tyrants' sighs. THE PRIMROSE. Surely that man is pure in thought and deed, Whom spirits teach in breeze-borne melodies; For he finds tongue in every flower and weed, And admonition in mute harmonies; Erect he moves, by truth and beauty led, And climbs his throne, for such a monarch meet, To gaze on valleys, that, around him spread, Carpet the hall of heav'n beneath his feet. How like a trumpet, under all the skies Blown, to convene all forms that love his beams, Light speaks in splendour to the poet's eyes, O'er dizzy rocks and woods, and headlong streams! How like the voice of woman, when she sings To her beloved, of love and constancy, The vernal odours, o'er the murmurings Of distant waters, pour their melody Into his soul, mix'd with the throstle's song And the wren's twitter? Welcome then, again, Love-listening primrose; though not parted long, We meet, like lovers, after years of pain. Oh, thou bring'st blissful childhood back to me! Thou still art loveliest in the lonest place; Still, as of old, day glows with love for thee, And reads our heav'nly Father in thy face. Surely thy thoughts are humble and devout, Flower of the pensive gold! for why should heav'n Deny to thee his noblest boon of thought, If to earth's demigods 'tis vainly given? Answer me, sinless sister! Thou hast speech Though silent. Fragrance is thy eloquence, Beauty thy language; and thy smile might teach Ungrateful man to pardon Providence. SPENSERIAN. [Sun of Destruction; ne'er again arise] Sun of Destruction; ne'er again arise The flamy gloom of flaming temples o'er, To shout thy words of fire beneath red skies, Athwart fire-gleaming sea, and burning shore— “Burn, burn, till all is burnèd!” Never more Let men say, “Light destroys.” No, rather crown The Good dethroned with beams that shone of yore; As when a bard, of yet unborn renown, Casts o'er his deathless page the light of suns gone down. SPRING. Again the violet of our early days Drinks beauteous azure from the golden sun, And kindless into fragrance at his blaze; The streams, rejoiced that winter's work is done, Talk of to-morrow's cowslips, as they run. Wild apple, thou art blushing into bloom! Thy leaves are coming, snowy-blossom'd thorn! Wake, buried lily! spirit, quit thy tomb? And thou, shade-loving hyacinth, be born! Then, haste, sweet rose! sweet woodbine, hymn the morn, Whose dew-drops shall illume with pearly light Each grassy blade that thick embattled stands From sea to sea, while daisies infinite Uplift in praise their little glowing hands, O'er every hill that under heav'n expands. A SHADOW. A poor affrighted worm, Where sky and mountain meet, I stood before the storm, And heard his strong heart beat. He drew his black brows down— My knees each other smote: The mountains felt his frown, His dark unutter'd thought The mountains, at his scowl, Pray'd mutely to the skies: He spoke, and shook my soul; He scorch'd me with his eyes. Alone, beneath the sky, I stood the storm before: No! God, the Storm, and I— We trode the desert floor; High on the mountain sod, The whirlwind's dwellingplace, The Worm, the Storm, and God Were present, face to face. From earth a shadow brake, E'en where my feet had trode; The shadow laugh'd and spake And shook his hand at God. Then up it rear'd its head, Beneath the lightning's blaze; “Omnipotent!” it said, “Bring back my yesterdays.” God smiled the gloom away; Wide earth and heav'n were bright; In light my shadow lay, I stood with God in light; With Him who wings the storm, Or bids the storm be still, The shadow of a worm Held converse on the hill. ANTICIPATION. Hail, Realm of gloom! whose clouds are ice! whose air Is made of thought-sick sighs! Whose fields are dead men's dust, from which despair Shrinks as he dies! Though on thee, and within (sad Infinite!) Are darkness, death, and doom; Beyond thee shines the sun of mind and might, The Power that made thee, God—hail, Holy Light! I come, I come. PRESTON MILLS. The day was fair, the cannon roar'd, Cold blew the bracing north, And Preston's Mills, by thousands, pour'd Their little captives forth. All in their best they paced the street, All glad that they were free; And sung a song with voices sweet— They sung of Liberty! But from their lips the rose had fled, Like “death-in-life” they smiled; And still, as each pass'd by, I said, Alas! is that a child? Flags waved, and men—a ghastly crew— March'd with them, side by side: While, hand in hand, and two by two, They moved—a living tide. Thousands and thousands—all so white!— With eyes so glazed and dull! O God! it was indeed a sight Too sadly beautiful! And, oh, the pang their voices gave Refuses to depart! This is a wailing for the grave! I whisper'd to my heart. It was as if, where roses blush'd, A sudden blasting gale, O'er fields of bloom had rudely rush'd, And turn'd the roses pale. It was as if, in glen and grove, The wild birds sadly sung; And every linnet mourn'd its love, And every thrush its young. It was as if, in dungeon gloom, Where chain'd despair reclined, A sound came from the living tomb, And hymn'd the passing wind. And while they sang, and though they smiled, My soul groan'd heavily— O who would be or have a child? A mother who would be? FAMINE IN A SLAVE SHIP. They stood on the deck of the slave-freighted barque, All hopeless, all dying, while waited the shark; Sons, Fathers, and Mothers, who shriek'd as they press'd The infants that pined till they died on the breast— A crowd of sad mourners, who sigh'd to the gale, While on all their dark faces the darkness grew pale. White demons beheld them, with curse and with frown, And cursed them, from morn till the darkness came down; And knew not compassion, but laugh'd at their pray'r, When they called on their God, or wept loud in despair; Till again rose the morn, and all hush'd was the wail, And on cheeks stark and cold the grim darkness was pale. Then the white heartless demons, with curse and with frown, Gave the dead to the deep, till the darkness came down: But the angel who blasteth, unheard and unseen, Bade the tyrants lie low where their victims had been: And down dropp'd the waves, and stone-still hung the sail, And black sank the dead, while more pale grew the pale. Stern angel, how calmly his chosen he slew! And soon the survivors were fearfully few; For, wall'd o'er their heads the red firmament stood, And the sun saw his face in a mirror of blood; Till they fed on each other, and drank of the sea, And wildly cursed God in their madness of glee! What hand sweeps the stars from the cheek of the night? Who lifts up the sea in the wrath of his might? Why, down from his glance, shrinks in horror the shark? Why stumbles o'er mountains the blind foodless barque? Lo, his lightning speaks out, from the growl of the gale! And shrieking she sinks—while the darkness turns pale! THE DYING BOY TO THE SLOE BLOSSOM. Before thy leaves thou com'st once more, White blossom of the sloe! Thy leaves will come as heretofore; But this poor heart, its troubles o'er, Will then lie low. A month at least before thy time Thou com'st, pale flower, to me; For well thou know'st the frosty rime Will blast me ere my vernal prime, No more to be. Why here in winter? No storm lowers O'er Nature's silent shroud! But blithe larks meet the sunny showers, High o'er the doom'd untimely flowers In beauty bow'd. Sweet violets, in the budding grove, Peep where the glad waves run; The wren below, the thrush above, Of bright to-morrow's joy and love Sing to the sun. And where the rose-leaf, ever bold, Hears bees chant hymns to God, The breeze-bow'd palm, moss'd o'er with gold, Smiles on the well in summer cold, And daisied sod. But thou, pale blossom, thou art come, And flowers in winter blow, To tell me that the worm makes room For me, her brother, in the tomb, And thinks me slow. For as the rainbow of the dawn Foretells an eve of tears, A sunbeam on the sadden'd lawn I smile, and weep to be withdrawn In early years. Thy leaves will come! but songful spring Will see no leaf of mine; Her bells will ring, her bride's-maids sing, When my young leaves are withering Where no suns shine. O might I breathe morn's dewy breath, When June's sweet Sabbaths chime! But, thine before my time, O death! I go where no flower blossometh, Before my time. Even as the blushes of the morn Vanish, and long ere noon The dew-drop dieth on the thorn, So fair I bloom'd; and was I born To die as soon? To love my mother and to die— To perish in my bloom! Is this my sad brief history?— A tear dropp'd from a mother's eye Into the tomb. He lived and loved—will sorrow say— By early sorrow tried; He smiled, he sigh'd, he past away; His life was but an April day— He loved and died! My mother smiles, then turns away, But turns away to weep: They whisper round me—what they say I need not hear, for in the clay I soon must sleep. Oh, love is sorrow! sad it is To be both tried and true; I ever trembled in my bliss; Now there are farewells in a kiss— They sigh adieu. But woodbines flaunt when blue bells fade, Where Don reflects the skies; And many a youth in Shire-cliff's shade Will ramble where my boyhood play'd, Though William dies. Then panting woods the breeze will feel, And bowers, as heretofore, Beneath their load of roses reel; But I through woodbined lanes shall steal No more, no more. Well, lay me by my brother's side, Where late we stood and wept; For I was stricken when he died— I felt the arrow as he sigh'd His last and slept. THE WONDERS OF THE LANE. Strong climber of the mountain's side, Though thou the vale disdain, Yet walk with me where hawthorns hide The wonders of the lane. High o'er the rushy springs of Don The stormy gloom is roll'd; The moorland hath not yet put on His purple, green, and gold. But here the titling The Hedge Sparrow. spreads his wing, Where dewy daisies gleam; And here the sun-flower The Dandelion. of the spring Burns bright in morning's beam. To mountain winds the famish'd fox Complains that Sol is slow O'er headlong steeps and gushing rocks His royal robe to throw. But here the lizard seeks the sun, Here coils in light the snake; And here the fire-tuft The Golden-Crested Wren. hath begun Its beauteous nest to make. O then, while hums the earliest bee Where verdure fires the plain, Walk thou with me, and stoop to see The glories of the lane! For, oh, I love these banks of rock, This roof of sky and tree, These tufts, where sleeps the gloaming clock, And wakes the earliest bee! As spirits from eternal day Look down on earth secure, Gaze thou, and wonder, and survey A world in miniature! A world not scorn'd by Him who made Even weakness by his might; But solemn in his depth of shade, And splendid in his light. Light! not alone on clouds afar O'er storm-loved mountains spread, Or widely teaching sun and star, Thy glorious thoughts are read; Oh, no! thou art a wondrous book To sky, and sea, and land— A page on which the angels look, Which insects understand! And here, O Light! minutely fair, Divinely plain and clear, Like splinters of a crystal hair, Thy bright small hand is here. Yon drop-fed lake, six inches wide, Is Huron, girt with wood; This driplet feeds Missouri's tide— And that Niagara's flood. What tidings from the Andes brings Yon line of liquid light, That down from heav'n in madness flings The blind foam of its might? Do I not hear his thunder roll— The roar that ne'er is still? 'Tis mute as death!—but in my soul It roars, and ever will. What forests tall of tiniest moss Clothe every little stone! What pigmy oaks their foliage toss O'er pigmy valleys lone! With shade o'er shade, from ledge to ledge, Ambitious of the sky, They feather o'er the steepest edge Of mountains mushroom high. O God of marvels! who can tell What myriad living things On these grey stones unseen may dwell; What nations, with their kings? I feel no shock, I hear no groan, While fate perchance o'erwhelms Empires on this subverted stone— A hundred ruin'd realms! Lo! in that dot, some mite, like me, Impell'd by woe or whim, May crawl some atoms cliffs to see— A tiny world to him! Lo! while he pauses, and admires The works of Nature's might, Spurn'd by my foot, his world expires, And all to him is night! O God of terrors! what are we?— Poor insects, spark'd with thought! Thy whisper, Lord, a word from thee Could smite us into nought! But should'st thou wreck our father-land And mix it with the deep, Safe in the hollow of thine hand Thy little ones would sleep. SLEEP. Sleep! to the homeless, thou art home; The friendless find in thee a friend; And well is he, where'er he roam, Who meets thee at his journey's end. Thy stillness is the planet's speed; Thy weakness is unmeasured might; Sparks from the hoof of death's pale steed— Worlds flash and perish in thy sight. The daring will to thee alone— The will and power are given to thee— To lift the veil of the unknown, The curtain of eternity— To look uncensured, though unbidden, On marvels from the seraph hidden! Alone to be—where none have been! Alone to see—what none have seen! And to astonish'd reason tell The secrets of th' Unsearchable! THE FATAL BIRTH. Foul parent of fair child, swollen Bread-tax! Thou, On plunder'd commerce, didst beget Reform: We see a bright to-morrow on her brow, And make our hope thy nursling of the storm. But many a fangèd worm, and biped brute, On whose dark heart the eye of love ne'er smiled, Would fain the promise of her morn refute. Die then, dread power! and have no other child; For it is written that thy second-born, If second-born thou have, will thunder-strike Temple and tower, of strength and splendour shorn By hands with famine lean; and, Sampson-like, Shaking the pillars of the gold-roof'd state, Whelm high, and low, and all, in one remorseless fate. EPIGRAM. [“Come, at last?” said Horns to Eldon—] “Come, at last?” said Horns to Eldon— “Better late than never: My Depute! Thou long hast well done; Keep my seals for ever.” TRANSPLANTED FLOWERS. Ye living gems of cold and fragrant fire! Die ye for ever, when ye die, ye flowers? Take ye, when in your beauty ye expire, An everlasting farewell of your bowers? No more to listen for the wooing air, And song-brought morn, the cloud-tinged woodlands o'er! No more to June's soft lip your breasts to bare, And drink fond evening's dewy breath no more! Soon fades the sweetest, first the fairest dies, For frail and fair are sisters; but the heart, Fill'd with deep love, death's power to kill denies, And sobs e'en o'er the dead, “We cannot part!” Have I not seen thee, Wild Rose, in my dreams, Like a pure spirit—beauteous as the skies, When the clear blue is brightest, and the streams Dance down the hills, reflecting the rich dyes Of morning clouds, and cistus woodbine-twined?— Didst thou not wake me from a dream of death? Yea, and thy voice was sweeter than the wind When it inhales the love-sick violet's breath, Bending it down with kisses, where the bee Hums over golden gorse, and sunny broom. Soul of the Rose! What saidst thou then to me? “We meet,” thou saidst, “though sever'd by the tomb: Lo, brother, this is heav'n! And, thus the just shall bloom.” SPENSERIAN. [O'er Byron's dust our sorrows should be steel'd] O'er Byron's dust our sorrows should be steel'd, Or sternly burn, as, burning slow, he died— Till one long groan from shuddering Greece reveal'd That fate had done her worst; and o'er the tide Loud yell'd the Turk his triumph-howl of pride. Yet will they flow, these woman's drops; for thou Didst die for woman, though her hand applied No gentle pressure to thy fever'd brow: O Byron, “thou, within, hadst that which passeth show!” SPENSERIAN. [Thou, Byron, wast—like him, the iron-crown'd—] Thou, Byron, wast—like him, the iron-crown'd— Thought-stricken, scorch'd, and “old in middle age.” “All-naked feeling's” restless victims bound, Ill could renown your secret pangs assuage. Two names of glory in one deathless page! Both unbeloved, both peerless, both exil'd, And prison'd both, though one could choose his cage; Dying, he call'd, in vain, on wife and child; And in your living hearts, the worm was domiciled. HYMN, WRITTEN FOR THE ROTHERHAM POLITICAL UNION, AND SUNG THERE ON THE CELEBRATION OF THE PASSING OF THE THREE REFORM BILLS. We thank Thee, Lord of earth and heav'n, For hope, and strength, and triumph given! We thank Thee that the fight is won, Although our work is but begun. We met, we crush'd the evil powers; A nobler task must now be ours— Their victims maim'd and poor to feed, And bind the bruised and broken reed. O let not Ruin's will be done, When Freedom's fight is fought and won! The deed of Brougham, Russell, Grey, Outlives the night! Lord, give us day! Grant time, grant patience, to renew, What England's foes and thine o'erthrew;— If they destroy'd, let us restore, And say to Misery, mourn no more. Lord, let the human storm be still'd! Lord, let the million mouths be fill'd! Let labour cease to toil in vain! Let England be herself again! Then shall this land her arms stretch forth, To bless the East, and tame the North; On tyrants' hearths wake buried souls, And call to life the murder'd Poles. Sing, Britons, sing! The sound shall go Wherever Freedom finds a foe: This day a trumpet's voice is blown O'er every despot's heart and throne. THE EXCURSION. Bone-weary, many-childed, trouble-tried! Wife of my bosom, wedded to my soul! Mother of nine that live, and two that died! This day, drink health from Nature's mountain bowl; Nay, why lament the doom which mocks control? The buried are not lost, but gone before. Then, dry thy tears, and see the river roll O'er rocks, that crown'd yon time-dark heights of yore, Now, tyrant-like, dethroned, to crush the weak no more. The young are with us yet, and we with them: O thank the Lord for all He gives or takes— The wither'd bud, the living flower, or gem! And He will bless us when the world forsakes! Lo! where thy fisher-born, abstracted, takes, With his fix'd eyes, the trout he cannot see! Lo, starting from his earnest dream, he wakes! While our glad Fanny, with raised foot and knee, Bears down at Noe's side, the bloom-bow'd hawthorn tree. Dear children! when the flowers are full of bees; When sun-touch'd blossoms shed their fragrant snow; When song speaks like a spirit, from the trees Whose kindled greenness hath a golden glow; When, clear as music, rill and river flow, With trembling hues, all changeful, tinted o'er By that bright pencil which good spirits know Alike in earth and heaven—'tis sweet, once more, Above the sky-tinged hills to see the storm-bird soar. 'Tis passing sweet to wander, free as air, Blythe truants in the bright and breeze-bless'd day, Far from the town—where stoop the sons of care O'er plans of mischief, till their souls turn grey, And dry as dust, and dead-alive are they— Of all self-buried things the most unbless'd: O Morn! to them no blissful tribute pay! O Night's long-courted slumbers! bring no rest To men who laud man's foes, and deem the basest best! God! would they handcuff Thee? and, if they could Chain the free air, that, like the daisy, goes To every field; and bid the warbling wood Exchange no music with the willing rose For love-sweet odours, where the woodbine blows And trades with every cloud, and every beam Of the rich sky! Their gods are bonds and blows, Rocks, and blind shipwreck; and they hate the stream That leaves them still behind, and mocks their changeless dream. They know ye not, ye flowers that welcome me, Thus glad to meet, by trouble parted long! They never saw ye—never may they see Your dewy beauty, when the throstle's song Floweth like starlight, gentle, calm, and strong! Still, Avarice, starve their souls! still, lowest Pride, Make them the meanest of the basest throng! And may they never, on the green hill's side, Embrace a chosen flower, and love it as a bride! Blue Eyebright! The Germander Speedwell. loveliest flower of all that grow In flower-loved England! Flower, whose hedge-side gaze Is like an infant's! What heart doth not know Thee, cluster'd smiler of the bank! where plays The sunbeam with the emerald snake, and strays The dazzling rill, companion of the road Which the lone bard most loveth, in the days When hope and love are young? O come abroad, Blue Eyebright! and this rill shall woo thee with an ode. Awake, blue Eyebright! while the singing wave Its cold, bright, beauteous, soothing tribute drops From many a grey rock's foot, and dripping cave; While yonder, lo, the starting stone-chat hops! While here the cotter's cow its sweet food crops; While black-faced ewes and lambs are bleating there; And, bursting through the briers, the wild ass stops— Kicks at the strangers—then turns round to stare— Then lowers his large red ears and shakes his long dark hair. SONG. [What! canst thou smile, thou heart of ice?] What! canst thou smile, thou heart of ice? Thou! who would'st basely sacrifice, To pet thy meanest prejudice, The holiest hopes of man? Or dost thou sneer, in rage and fear, Because the hated day is near, When gods like thee must disappear, Or have no worshippers! Well, smile or sneer, and worship still Old fraud's supremacy of ill; But bow not unto Dagon's will The hearts of honest men. Thy slave-adored Abaddon's name May none but lips like thine proclaim! And ignominious be thy fame, Even as thy virtues are! SPENSERIAN. [Even here, on earth, not altogether fade] Even here, on earth, not altogether fade The good and vile. Men, in their words and deeds, Live when the hand and heart in earth are laid; For thoughts are things, and written thoughts are seeds— Our very dust buds forth in flowers or weeds. Then let me write for immortality One honest song, uncramp'd by forms or creeds, That men unborn may read my times and me, Taught by my living words, when I shall cease to be. MAY. Shade-loving Hyacinth! thou com'st again; And thy rich odours seem to swell the flow Of the lark's song, the redbreast's lonely strain, And the stream's tune—best sung where wild-flowers blow, And ever sweetest where the sweetest grow. Who hath condensed, O broom! in thy bright flowers The light of mid-day suns? What virgin's cheek Can match this apple bloom—these glowing showers Of glistering daisies? How their blushes speak Of rosy hues that red o'er ocean break, When cloudy morn is calm, yet fain to weep, Because the beautful are still the frail! Hark! 'tis the thrush!—he sings beneath the steep, Where coolness ever charms the fountain'd vale! How eloquently well he tells his tale, That love is yet on earth, and yet will be, Though virtue struggles, and seems born to fail, Because fall'n man, who might be great and free, Toils for the wolf, and bribes iniquity. Thou are not false, sweet bird! thou dost not keep The word of promise to our ear alone, And break it to our hearts! Maids do not weep Because thou feign'st; for thee no victims groan; Thy voice is truth, and love is all thy own. Then, for thy sake, I will not loathe man's face; Will not believe that virtues are veil'd sins; That bounty may be mean, and kindness base; That fortune plays the game which wisdom wins; That human worth still ends where it begins. Though man were wholly false, though hope were none Of late redemption from his sin-made woes, Yet would I trust in God and goodness. On From sun to sun the stream of mercy flows; And still on humble graves the little daisy grows. THE POLISH FUGITIVES. WRITTEN FOR THE HULL POLISH RECORD. The day went down in fire, The burning ocean o'er— A son and grey-hair'd sire Walk'd silent, on the shore. They walk'd, worn gaunt with cares, Where land and billow meet— And of that land was theirs The dust upon their feet. Yet they, erewhile, had lands Which plenteous harvests bore; But, spoil'd by Russian hands, Their own was theirs no more. They came to cross the foam, And seek, beyond the deep, A happier, safer home— A land where sowers reap. Yet, while the playful gold Laugh'd into purply green The crimson clouds that roll'd The sea and sky between, The youth his brow upraised From thoughts of deepest woe, And on the ocean gazed, Like one who fronts a foe. The sire was calm and mild, And brightly shone his eye;— How like a stately child, He look'd on sea and sky! But on his son's lean cheek, And in his hands, grasp'd hard, A heart, that scorn'd to break, With dreadful feelings warr'd. For he had left behind A wife, who dungeon'd lay; And loath'd the mournful wind, That sobb'd—Away, away! Five boys and girls had he: In fetters pined they all; And when he saw the sea, On him he heard them call. Oh, fiercely he dash'd down The tear—that came, at length— Then, almost with a frown. He pray'd to God for strength. “Hold up!” the father cried, “If Poland cannot thrive, The mother o'er the tide, May follow with her five. “But Poland yet shall fling Dismay on Poland's foes, As when the Wizard King The name which the Turks, in their superstitious dread, gave to the great Sobieski. Avenged her ancient woes. “For soon her cause will be Roused Europe's battle cry; ‘To perish or be free! To conquer or to die!’” His hands clasp'd o'er his head, The son look'd up for aid; “So be it, Lord!” he said, And still look'd up, and pray'd, Till from his eyes, like rain, When first the black clouds growl, The agony of pain, In tears, gush'd from his soul. SPENSERIAN. [I saw a horrid thing of many names] I saw a horrid thing of many names, And many shapes. Some call'd it wealth, some power, Some grandeur. From its heart it shot black flames, That scorch'd the souls of millions, hour by hour; And its proud eyes rain'd everywhere a shower Of hopeless life, and helpless misery; For, spoused to fraud, destruction was its dower! But its cold brightness could not hide from me The parent base of crime, the nurse of poverty! SPENSERIAN. [The marble forms of mortals half divine] The marble forms of mortals half divine Yield silently the impress grand of mind To time and ruin: long the weltering brine, With heaven's red bolt and reinless blast combined, Assails the rock in vain: even in the wind, Slow burns the mighty oak, the forest-king, Majestic still: so, lofty souls, declined From their high deeds, a careless mantle fling O'er cureless wounds, and smile—though life is withering. SPENSERIAN. [A tear for thee? Not, Byron, if thy name] A tear for thee? Not, Byron, if thy name Shall be a watchword to unchain the slave, Rolling o'er tyrants' hearts like thundering flame, And kindling, as with soul, th' embattled wave; Till conquering Freedom, on their briny grave, Find Greeks like those who died at Salamis. Arise, and equal them, ye modern brave! Let past and future ages yield to this! And be your names a spell, as Byron's was and is. SPENSERIAN. [A tear for Byron? Weakness mourns the weak] A tear for Byron? Weakness mourns the weak, And Beauty dies in weeping Love's embrace, And common frailties common sorrows seek. But Scourger of the scourgers of thy race! Thou aw'st me so, that to thy resting-place I bring stern feelings, not unmix'd with fear. Standing before the fear'd of all the base, I, who oft wept thee, cannot weep thee here, Bard of the broken heart, high soul, and burning tear! COME AND GONE. The silent moonbeams on the drifted snow Shine cold, and pale, and blue, While through the cottage-door the yule log's glow Casts on the iced oak's trunk and grey rock's brow A ruddy hue. The red ray and the blue, distinct and fair, Like happy groom and bride, With azured green, and emerald-orange glare, Gilding the icicles from branches bare, Lie side by side. The door is open, and the fire burns bright, And Hannah, at the door Stands—through the clear, cold, moon'd, and starry night, Gazing intently towards the scarce-seen height, O'er the white moor. 'Tis Christmas eve! and, from the distant town, Her pale apprenticed son Will to his heart-sick mother hasten down, And snatch his hour of annual transport—flown Ere well begun. The Holy Book unread upon his knee, Old Alfred watcheth calm; Till Edwin comes, no solemn prayer prays he; Till Edwin comes, the text he cannot see, Nor chant the psalm. And comes he not? Yea, from the wind-swept hill The cottage-fire he sees; While of the past remembrance drinks her fill, Crops childhood's flowers, and bids the unfrozen rill Shine through green trees. In thought, he hears the bee hum o'er the moor; In thought, the sheep-boy's call; In thought, he meets his mother at the door; In thought, he hears his father, old and poor, “Thank God for all.” His sister he beholds, who died when he, In London bound, wept o'er Her last sad letter; vain her prayer to see Poor Edwin yet again:—he ne'er will be Her playmate more! No more with her will hear the bittern boom At evening's dewy close! No more with her will wander where the broom Contends in beauty with the hawthorn bloom And budding rose! Oh, love is strength! love, with divine control, Recalls us when we roam! In living light it bids the dimmed eye roll, And gives a dove's wing to the fainting soul, And bears it home. Home!—that sweet word hath turn'd his pale lip red, Relumed his fireless eye; Again the morning o'er his cheek is spread; The early rose that seem'd for ever dead, Returns to die. Home! home!—Behold the cottage of the moor, That hears the sheep-boy's call! And Hannah meets him at the open door With faint fond scream; and Alfred, old and poor, “Thanks God for all!” His lip is on his mother's; to her breast She clasps him, heart to heart; His hands between his father's hands are press'd; They sob with joy, caressing and caress'd: How soon to part! Why should they know that thou so soon, O Death! Wilt pluck him, like a weed? Why fear consumption in his quick-drawn breath? Why dread the hectic flower, which blossometh That worms may feed? They talk of other days, when, like the birds, He cull'd the wild flower's bloom, And roam'd the moorland, with the houseless herds; They talk of Jane's sad prayer, and her last words, “Is Edwin come?” He wept. But still, almost till morning beam'd, They talk'd of Jane—then slept. But, though he slept, his eyes, half open, gleam'd; For still of dying Jane her brother dream'd, And, dreaming, wept. At mid-day he arose, in tears, and sought The churchyard where she lies. He found her name beneath the snow-wreath wrought; Then, from her grave, a knot of grass he brought, With tears and sighs. The hour of parting came, when feelings deep In the heart's depth awake. To his sad mother, pausing oft to weep, He gave a token, which he bade her keep For Edwin's sake. It was a grassy sprig, and auburn tress, Together twined and tied. He left them, then, for ever! could they less Than bless and love that type of tenderness?— Childless they died! Long in their hearts a cherish'd thought they wore; And till their latest breath, Bless'd him, and kiss'd his last gift o'er and o'er; But they beheld their Edwin's face no more In life or death! For where the upheaved sea of trouble foams, And sorrow's billows rave, Men, in the wilderness of myriad homes, Far from the desert, where the wild flock roams, Dug Edwin's grave. A THUNDER STORM IN WINTER. He spake to eye and ear! and, like a tree Rooted in heaven, shot down the branchy flame, While the blue moonlight vanish'd suddenly. Brighter than light on snow, the brightness came, Filling the vales with forests of strange fire, The streams with blood; and flinging o'er the cloud Banners of crimson, laced with silver wire. Down to mute earth the giant darkness bow'd, Giving the hill immeasurable height, That propp'd the sky; then changed the troubled form, While from his bosom fell the headlong weight Of volley'd hail; and, whispering through the storm, The thunderer spake again: “What fear'st thou? Live, poor worm!” PROLOGUE TO THE CORN-LAW RHYMES. For thee, my country, thee, do I perform, Sternly, the duty of a man born free, Heedless, though ass, and wolf, and venomous worm, Shake ears and fangs, with brandish'd bray, at me; Alone as Crusoe on the hostile sea, For thee, for us, for ours, do I upraise The standard of my song! for thine and mine I toll the knell of England's better days; And lift my hated voice that mine and thine May undegrade the human form divine. Perchance that voice, if heard, is heard too late: The buried dust of Tyre may wake, and sway Reconquer'd seas; but what shall renovate The dead-alive, who dread no judgment-day? Souls, whom the lust of gold hath turn'd to clay? And what but scorn and slander will reward The rabble's poet, and his honest song? Gambler for blanks! thou play'st an idiot's card; For, sure to fall, the weak attack the strong: Ay, but what strength is theirs, whose might is based on wrong? FROM GOETHE. How like a stithy is this land! And we lie on it like good metal Long hammer'd by a senseless hand! But will such thumping make a kettle? CANNING. He rose—a veteran proud of honest scars; He stood—a bard, with lightning in his look; He spoke—Apollo had the voice of Mars: His frown all hope from phalanx'd faction took, While flash'd his satire, like a falchion bared, On all who meanly thought, or basely dared. He spoke, and died. And therefore must the sky Return to sunless, moonless, starless night? And therefore must the hopes of commerce fly To climes unsatrapp'd? O departing light, Linger awhile! thy loveliness is might, And youth, and glory. Earth, from east to west, Uplift thy multudinous hands in prayer! Laugh, stormy Russ! to thee the worst is best. Shout, foes of Man! the scourge and rack prepare! But, Erin, there is hope in thy despair. And, Freedom! faint not thou, though Canning dies. Weak is the State, and tottering to its fall, That on one mind for strength and life relies; That State should be an omen unto all Who stand not self-supported, and appal E'en tyrants, blindly digging their own graves. But Freedom's hope, when other hope is none, Calm, or perturb'd, remains; like winds and waves, Alike surviving battles lost or won; More deathless than the dust of Marathon. FOREST WORSHIP. Within the sun-lit forest, Our roof the bright blue sky, Where fountains flow, and wild flowers blow, We lift our hearts on high: Beneath the frown of wicked men Our country's strength is bowing; But, thanks to God! they can't prevent The lone wildflowers from blowing! High, high above the tree-tops, The lark is soaring free; Where streams the light through broken clouds His speckled breast I see: Beneath the might of wicked men The poor man's worth is dying; But, thank'd be God! in spite of them, The lark still warbles flying! The preacher prays, “Lord, bless us!” “Lord, bless us!” echo cries; “Amen!” the breezes murmur low; “Amen!” the rill replies: The ceaseless toil of woe-worn hearts The proud with pangs are paying; But here, O God of earth and heaven! The humble heart is praying? How softly, in the pauses Of song, re-echoed wide, The cushat's coo, the linnet's lay, O'er rill and river glide! With evil deeds of evil men Th' affrighted land is ringing; But still, O Lord! the pious heart And soul-toned voice are singing! Hush! hush! the preacher preacheth: “Woe to the oppressor, woe!” But sudden gloom o'ercasts the sun And sadden'd flowers below: So frowns the Lord!—but, tyrants, ye Deride his indignation, And see not in his gather'd brow Your days of tribulation! Speak low, thou heaven-paid teacher! The tempest bursts above: God whispers in the thunder: hear The terrors of his love! On useful hands, and honest hearts, The base their wrath are wreaking; But, thank'd be God! they can't prevent The storm of heav'n from speaking. A SONG IN EXILE. Yes, with groans my lyre is strung; Tears, from Poland's ruin wrung, Flow in music from my tongue, Poland's tears and Liberty's. England saw our setting sun! Britons! was it wisely done? You gave Warsaw to the Hun! Why not London, Englishman? Lo! while Russia's iron tread, Where we fell or whence we fled, Shakes the dust of Poland's dead! Europe trembles guiltily! Tyrant! twice we overthrew Hordes of thine, to tyrants true! Twice we smote and twice we slew, Recreant France! thy conquerors. Yet, with us was Europe sold; Gaul's delay, and England's gold, Frighted France and Britain cold, Bribed the Goth to purchase her. Poland fell—and they may fall, Crush'd on Freedom's funeral pall; But the Lord is Lord of all; Thou, O Father, tremblest not! Hopeless, homeless, do we roam? Be Revenge our hope and home! Thoughts that quench, in gory foam, Moscow's fiery funeral! By Polonia's gory sod! Dig thou wide, Polonia's God, Dig thou deep, where freemen trod, Russia's grave and Tyranny's. ON AN ORIGINAL SKETCH, DRAWN WITH A PENCIL ON A WALL, BY MY SON FRANCIS. I saw a head, a young but lifeless face— On its dark hair, and two white wings, reposed, As on a pillow. Tears had left their trace Down each sad cheek; beneath dim eyes half-closed, The calm lips smiled; and like a sky arose, Amid thick curls, the forehead domed for thought. It lay, as if the soul—though worn with woes, And bathed in parting tears—serenely sought For strength in sleep, before it wing'd its flight From darkness, doubt, and dust, to dwell with God, in light. SONG. [They sold the chairs, they took the bed, and went] They sold the chairs, they took the bed, and went; A fiend's look after them the husband sent; His thin wife held him faintly, but in vain; She saw the alehouse in his scowl of pain. Upon her pregnant womb her hand she laid, Then stabb'd her living child! and shriek'd, dismay'd— “Oh, why had I a mother!” wildly said That saddest mother, gazing on the dead. Slowly she turn'd, and sought the silent room— Her last-born child's lone dwellingplace and tomb! Because they could not purchase earth and prayer, The dear dead boy had long lain coffin'd there! But that boy hath a sister—where is she? Dying, where none a cherub fall'n may see:— “Mother! O come!” she sobs, with stifled groan, In that blest isle, where pity turns to stone. Before the judge, the childless stood amazed, With none to say, “My Lord! the wretch is crazed.” Crowds saw her perish, but all eyes were dry; Drunk, in the crowd, her husband saw her die! Around the murderer's wrists they lock the chain: What, tyrant? whom hath Rapine's victim slain? The widow, hunger-stung and sorrow-bent, Who ask'd, with tears, her lodger's weekly rent! O Wholesale Dealers in waste, want, and war! Would that your deeds were written!—and they are! Written and graved, on minds and hearts oppress'd; Stamp'd deep, and blood-burnt-in, o'er realms unbless'd! TO THE BRAMBLE FLOWER. Thy fruit full-well the schoolboy knows, Wild bramble of the brake! So, put thou forth thy small white rose; I love it for his sake. Though woodbines flaunt and roses glow O'er all the fragrant bowers, Thou needst not be ashamed to show Thy satin-threaded flowers; For dull the eye, the heart is dull, That cannot feel how fair, Amid all beauty beautiful, Thy tender blossoms are! How delicate thy gauzy frill! How rich thy branchy stem! How soft thy voice, when woods are still, And thou sing'st hymns to them; While silent showers are falling slow And, 'mid the general hush, A sweet air lifts the little bough, Lone whispering through the bush! The primrose to the grave is gone; The hawthorn flower is dead; The violet by the moss'd grey stone Hath laid her weary head; But thou, wild bramble! back dost bring, In all their beauteous power, The fresh green days of life's fair spring, And boyhood's blossomy hour. Scorn'd bramble of the brake! once more Thou bid'st me be a boy, To gad with thee the woodlands o'er, In freedom and in joy. SPENSERIAN. [All unmatch'd Shakspeare, and the blind old Man] All unmatch'd Shakspeare, and the blind old Man Of London, hymn in every land and clime Our country's praise, while many an artisan Spins for her glory school-taught lays sublime. Them in her bosom, be they blank or rhyme, Oblivious spirits gently will inter. But three unborrow'd strains will to all time Give honour, glory, highest laud to her— Thalaba! Peter Bell! the Ancient Mariner! THOMAS. Thou art not dead, my son! my son! But God hath hence removed thee: Thou canst not die, my buried boy, While lives the sire who loved thee. How canst thou die, while weeps for thee The broken heart that bore thee; And e'en the thought that thou are not Can to her soul restore thee? Will grief forget thy willingness To run before thy duty? The love of all the good and true, That fill'd thine eyes with beauty? Thy pitying grace, thy dear request, When others had offended, That made thee look as angels look, When great good deeds are ended? The strength with which thy soul sustain'd Thy woes and daily wasting? Thy prayer, to stay with us, when sure That thou from us wast hasting? And that last smile, which seem'd to say— “Why cannot ye restore me?” Thy look'd farewell is in my heart, And brings thee still before me. What though the change, the fearful change, From thought, which left thee never, To unremembering ice and clay, Proclaim thee gone for ever? Thy half-closed lids, thy upturn'd eyes, Thy still and lifeless tresses; Thy marble lip, which moves no more, Yet more than grief expresses; The silence of thy coffin'd snow, By awed remembrance cherish'd; These dwell with me, like gather'd flowers That in their April perish'd. Thou art not gone, thou canst not go My bud, my blasted blossom! The pale rose of thy faded face Still withers in my bosom. O Mystery of Mysteries, That took'st my poor boy from me! What art thou, Death? all-dreaded Death! If weakness can o'ercome thee? We hear thee not! we see thee not, E'en when thy arrows wound us; But, viewless, printless, echoless, Thy steps are ever round us. Though more than life a mystery Art thou, the undeceiver, Amid thy trembling worshippers Thou seest no true believer. No!—but for life, and more than life, No fearful search could find thee: Tremendous shadow! who is He That ever stands behind thee? The Power who bids the worm deny The beam that o'er her blazes, And veils from us the holier light On which the seraph gazes, Where burns the throne of Him, whose name The sunbeams here write faintly; And where my child a stranger stands Amid the blest and saintly, And sobs aloud—while in his eyes The tears, o'erflowing, gather— “They come not yet!—until they come, Heav'n is not Heav'n, my Father! Why come they not? why comes not she From whom thy will removes me? O does she love me—love me still? I know my mother loves me! Then send her soon! and with her send The brethren of my bosom! My sisters too! Lord, let them all Bloom round the parted blossom! The only pang I could not bear Was leaving them behind me: I cannot bear it. Even in heaven The tears of parting blind me!” BIGOTRY. When calm minds strongly shoot into the night Their shafts of lightning, no roused hamlet screams; But darkness dies, pierced through and through with light, That casts in silence round its useful beams. Not so, when Zealots twang into the dark, Flight after flight, their mischief-whizzing spears; Though, thunder-wing'd, they hit or miss the mark, They never fail to fire their own long ears, Which blaze with splendour not to be endured, Except by them whose barns and corn-ricks are insured. DON AND ROTHER. Again we meet, where often we have met, Dear Rother! native Don! We meet again, to talk, with vain regret, Of deedless aims! and years remember'd yet— The past and gone! We meet again—perchance to meet no more! O Rivers of the heart! I hear a voice, unvoyaged billows o'er, Which bids me hasten to their pathless shore, And cries, “Depart!” “Depart!” it cries. “Why linger on the stage Where virtues are veil'd crimes? Have I not read thee, even from youth to age? Thou blotted book, with only one bright page! Thy honest rhymes! “Depart, pale Drone! What fruit-producing flower Hast thou rear'd on the plain? What useful moments count'st thou in thine hour? What victim hast thou snatch'd from cruel power? What tyrant slain?” I will obey the power whom all obey. Yes, Rivers of the heart! O'er that blind deep, where morning casts no ray To cheer the oarless wanderer on his way, I will depart. But first, O Rivers of my childhood! first My soul shall talk with you; For on your banks my infant thoughts were nursed; Here from the bud the spirit's petals burst, When life was new. Before my fingers learn'd to play with flowers, My feet through flowers to stray; Ere my tongue lisp'd, amid your dewy bowers, Its first glad hymn to Mercy's sunny showers, And air, and day; When, in my mother's arms, an infant frail, Along your windings borne, My blue eye caught your glimmer in the vale, Where halcyons darted o'er your willows pale, On wings like morn. Ye saw my feelings round that mother grow, Like green leaves round the root! Then thought, with danger came, and flower'd like woe! But deeds, the fervent deeds that blush and glow, Are Virtue's fruit. From infancy to youth; from schoolboy days, When life with stones and flowers Sports, like the stream that with the sunbeam plays Till age counts fearfully his number'd days— We waste our powers. What doth the man but what the child hath done? We live, we talk, we move! The best of all who prate beneath the sun; The praised of all who smile, and talk, and run; But live and love. And if the best are like the useless gem That shines in idle state; Heavy, on those who crush the useful stem— Heavy will fall the hand of God on them Who live and hate! Who bruise the weak, but bind no broken reed; Who know not ruth nor shame; Who, flowerless, ban the flower, to plant the weed; And curse the toiling worms on whom they feed, In God's great name! Can I not crush them? No. Then, warning voice, Teach me to welcome thee! I cannot crush them. Let me then rejoice Because thou call'st; and make my fate my choice— Bound and yet free. Is it not love, to loathe the loveless? Yea, 'Tis love like God's to man! The love of angels for their God!—Away! Such love alone repayeth those who pay— No other can. They love not God, who do not hate man's foes, With hatred—not like mine— But deep as Hell and blacker. To loathe those Who blast the hope of freedom as it blows, Is love divine. Ah! many a blossom of the holy tree Hath blossom'd but to fade! Poland! the tears of nations flow for thee! Thy bud of late redemption, Italy, In dust is laid! But hath no hope cheer'd man's despair since first I trod thy margin, Don? Yea, mighty links of evil's chain are burst; And they who curse, and will not bless, accursed Fall, one by one. Though Poland bleeds where Kosciusko died, Hark! truth-taught millions say, To thrones, crime-sceptred, “Lo, you are defied!” And, at my birth, Redemption's angel cried, “America!” Then, Rivers, tell my mother earth, I come To slumber on her breast! For, lo, my drooping thoughts refuse to bloom! My spirit shakes its fetters. I crave room For rest, for rest. FUNERAL HYMN. Father! our brother's course is run, And we bring home thy weary son; No more he toils, no more he weeps; And shall we mourn because he sleeps? He thank'd Thee, God of earth and sky, For all that creep, and all that fly; For weeds, that silent anthems raise, And thoughts, that make their silence praise. For every thorn and every flower! For conquering Right and baffled Power; For all the meek and all the proud, He thank'd the Lord of sun and cloud. For soul to feel and sight to see, In all thy works, but types of Thee; For all thy works, and for thy word, In life and death, he thank'd Thee, Lord. He thank'd Thee too for struggles long; For storms, that make the feeble strong; For every pang thy goodness gave; For hope deferr'd—and for the grave. Oh, welcome in the morn, the road That climbs to virtue's high abode! But when descends the evening dew, The inn of rest is welcome too. Thou sayst to man, “Arise, and run Thy glorious course, like yonder sun!” But when thy children need repose, Their Father's hand the curtain draws. What though with eyes that yet can weep, The sinner trembles into sleep? Thou know'st he yet shall wake and rise To gaze on Mercy's brightest skies. The fearful child, though still caress'd, Will tremble on his mother's breast, But he, she knows, is safe from ill, Though, watch'd by love, he trembles still. Lord! when our brother wakes, may they, Who watch beneath thy footstool, say, “Another wanderer is forgiven! Another child is born in heav'n!” FLOWERS FOR THE HEART. Flowers! winter flowers!—the child is dead, The mother cannot speak: O softly couch his little head, Or Mary's heart will break! Amid those curls of flaxen hair This pale pink ribbon twine, And on the little bosom there Place this wan lock of mine. How like a form in cold white stone, The coffin'd infant lies! Look, Mother, on thy little one! And tears will fill thine eyes. She cannot weep—more faint she grows, More deadly pale and still: Flowers! oh, a flower! a winter rose, That tiny hand to fill. Go, search the fields! the lichen wet Bends o'er th' unfailing well; Beneath the furrow lingers yet The scarlet pimpernel. Peeps not a snowdrop in the bower, Where never froze the spring? A daisy? Ah! bring childhood's flower! The half-blown daisy bring! Yes, lay the daisy's little head Beside the little cheek; O haste! the last of five is dead! The childless cannot speak! TO FANNY. Britoness! angels love in thee Angelic truth and piety; But angels do not bow the knee To God-defying homicides. For others' woes thy bosom bleeds; Deep is thy hate of hateful deeds; But why of words, and forms, and creeds, O why art thou the homager? Does true religion war on mind? Is pure religion deaf and blind? They best serve God, who serve mankind; Christ bade us feed his little ones. O then contemn the base and cold! Say to thy sons, “Be just and bold, Unawed by power, unbribed by gold!” Britoness! this is piety. Thou bid'st me scorn this world of care; “For better worlds,” thou say'st, “prepare!” Not I—if angel forms are there Apologists of tyranny. Where Milton's eyes, no longer dim, See Seraphs walk with slander'd Pym, I would not hear the cherubim Sing Tory odes to Castlereagh. A POET'S EPITAPH. Stop, Mortal! Here thy brother lies, The Poet of the Poor. His books were rivers, woods, and skies, The meadow, and the moor; His teachers were the torn hearts' wail, The tyrant, and the slave, The street, the factory, the jail, The palace—and the grave! The meanest thing, earth's feeblest worm, He fear'd to scorn or hate; And honour'd in a peasant's form The equal of the great. But if he loved the rich who make The poor man's little more, Ill could he praise the rich who take From plunder'd labour's store. A hand to do, a head to plan, A heart to feel and dare— Tell man's worst foes, here lies the man Who drew them as they are. EPIGRAM. [When long, the drama, in a sordid age] When long, the drama, in a sordid age, Had droop'd an exile; to the desert stage Impassion'd nature, weeping as she smiled, Led, by his trembling hand, her darling child: Even from the worms upstarted buried spleen, While Shakspeare's dust, in transport murmur'd— “Kean!” THE DEATH-HUNTED. Methought I wander'd long and far, and slept On purple heath flowers, where a dark stream crept, For ever young, along its bed of stone. But soon before my troubled spirit pass'd, A dream of unclimb'd hills, and forest vast, And sea-like lakes, and shadowy rivers lone. And there a man, whose youth seem'd palsied eld, Moved faintly, though by famish'd death impell'd: Lean was his cheek; yet beam'd his gentle eye, With a calm sadness, on the mountains hoar, And the magnificent flora, on the shore Of waters, piled against his native sky. And, “O,” he said, “false hope, that truth-like seem'd! I thought that toil might earn hard bread! I dream'd. Who hath had sorrows and despair like mine? Millions! to wander, or to perish, free! Green Erin's dower! can lightnings blast like thee? Cold Rapine! hath the wolf a tooth like thine? “Farewell, my Country! and oh, thank'd be thou, Realm of the roaring surge, that part'st us now! And hail, ye pathless swamps, ye unsail'd floods!— Thou owest nought, thou glittering snake, to me! Hiss! if thou wilt! I ask not bread of thee!” And then he plunged into the night of woods. The corpse-fed spectre, that had chased him o'er Woe-freighted waves, stopp'd ere he reach'd the shore; For a voice whisper'd from dim caves beneath, “Thou may'st spare one, if millions are behind! Turn then and cleave the blissful western wind Back to the grave of Hope, where Love is Death!” LINES WRITTEN AFTER SEEING, AT MR. JOHN HEPPENSTALL'S OF UPPERTHORPE, NEAR SHEFFIELD, THE PLATES OF AUDUBON'S BIRDS OF AMERICA. “Painting is silent music.” So said one Whose prose is sweetest painting. Rousseau. Audubon! Thou Raphael of great Nature's woods and seas! Thy living forms and hues, thy plants, thy trees, Bring deathless music from the houseless waste— The immortality of truth and taste. Thou giv'st bright accents to the voiceless sod; And all thy pictures are mute hymns to God. Why hast thou power to bear th' untravell'd soul Through farthest wilds, o'er ocean's stormy roll; And, to the prisoner of disease, bring home The homeless birds of ocean's roaring foam; But that thy skill might bid the desert sing The sun-bright plumage of th' Almighty's wing? With his own hues thy splendid lyre is strung; For genius speaks the universal tongue. “Come,” cries the bigot, black with pride and wine— “Come and hear me—the Word of God is mine!” “But I,” saith He, who paves with suns his car, And makes the storms his coursers from afar, And, with a glance of his all-dazzling eye, Smites into crashing fire the boundless sky— “I speak in this swift sea-bird's speaking eyes, These passion-shiver'd plumes, these lucid dyes: This beauty is my language! in this breeze I whisper love to forests and the seas; I speak in this lone flower—this dew-drop cold— That hornet's sting—yon serpent's neck of gold: These are my accents. Hear them! and behold How well my prophet-spoken truth agrees With the dread truth and mystery of these Sad, beauteous, grand, love-warbled mysteries!” Yes, Audubon! and men shall read in thee His language, written for eternity; And if, immortal in its thoughts, the soul Shall live in heaven, and spurn the tomb's control, Angels shall retranscribe, with pens of fire, Thy forms of Nature's terror, love, and ire, Thy copied words of God—when death-struck suns expire. ELEGY ON WILLIAM COBBETT. O bear him where the rain can fall, And where the winds can blow! And let the sun weep o'er his pall As to the grave ye go! And in some little lone churchyard, Beside the growing corn, Lay gentle Nature's stern prose bard, Her mightest peasant-born! Yes! let the wild-flower wed his grave, That bees may murmur near, When o'er his last home bend the brave, And say—“A man lies here.” For Britons honour Cobbett's name, Though rashly oft he spoke; And none can scorn, and few will blame, The low-laid heart of oak. See, o'er his prostrate branches, see, E'en factious hate consents To reverence, in the fallen tree, His British lineaments! Though gnarl'd the storm-toss'd boughs that braved The thunder's gather'd scowl, Not always through his darkness raved The storm-winds of the soul. Oh, no! in hours of golden calm, Morn met his forehead bold; And breezy evening sung her psalm Beneath his dew-dropp'd gold. The wren its crest of fibred fire With his rich bronze compared, While many a youngling's songful sire His acorn'd twiglets shared. The lark, above, sweet tribute paid, Where clouds with light were riven; And true-love sought his blue-bell'd shade, “To bless the hour of heav'n.” E'en when his stormy voice was loud, And guilt quaked at the sound, Beneath the frown that shook the proud The poor a shelter found. Dead Oak, thou liv'st! Thy smitten hands, The thunder of thy brow, Speak, with strange tongues, in many lands; And tyrants hear thee NOW! Beneath the shadow of thy name, Inspired by thy renown, Shall future patriots rise to fame, And many a sun go down. LINES ON SEEING UNEXPECTEDLY A NEW CHURCH, WHILE WALKING, ON THE SABBATH, IN OLD-PARK WOOD, NEAR SHEFFIELD. From Shirecliffe, o'er a silent sea of trees, When evening waned o'er Wadsley's cottages, I look'd on Loxley, Rivilin, and Don, While at my side stood truth-loved Pemberton; The unequalled lecturer on the drama. And wonder'd, far beneath me, to behold A golden spire, that glow'd o'er fields of gold. Out of the earth it rose, with sudden power, A bright flame, growing heavenward, like a flower, Where erst nor temple stood, nor holy psalm Rose to the mountains in the day of calm. There, at the altar, plighted hearts may sigh; There, side by side, how soon their dust may lie! Then carven stones the old, old tale will tell, That saddens joy with its brief chronicle, Till Time, with pinions stolen from the dove, Gently erase the epitaph of love; While rivers sing, on their unwearied way, The song that but with earth can pass away, That brings the tempest's accents from afar, And breathes of woodbines where no woodbines are! Yet deem not that Affection can expire, Though earth and skies shall melt in fervent fire; For truth hath written, on the stars above— “Affection cannot die, if God is Love!” Whene'er I pass a grave with moss o'ergrown, Love seems to rest upon the silent stone, Above the wreck of sublunary things, Like a tired angel sleeping on his wings. RIBBLEDIN; OR THE CHRISTENING. No name hast thou! lone streamlet That lovest Rivilin. Here, if a bard may christen thee, I'll call thee “Ribbledin;” Here, where first murmuring from thine urn, Thy voice deep joy expresses; And down the rock, like music, flows The wildness of thy tresses. Here, while beneath the umbrage Of Nature's forest bower, Bridged o'er by many a fallen birch, And watch'd by many a flower, To meet thy cloud-descended love, All trembling, thou retirest— Here will I murmur to thy waves The sad joy thou inspirest. Dim world of weeping mosses! A hundred years ago, Yon hoary-headed holly tree Beheld thy streamlet flow: See how he bends him down to hear The tune that ceases never! Old as the rocks, wild stream, he seems, While thou art young for ever. Wildest and lonest streamlet! Grey oaks, all lichen'd o'er! Rush-bristled isles! ye ivied trunks That marry shore to shore! And thou, gnarl'd dwarf of centuries, Whose snaked roots twist above me! O for the tongue or pen of Burns, To tell you how I love ye! Would that I were a river, To wander all alone Through some sweet Eden of the wild, In music of my own; And bathed in bliss, and fed with dew, Distill'd o'er mountains hoary, Return unto my home in heav'n On wings of joy and glory! Or that I were the lichen, That, in this roofless cave, (The dim geranium's lone boudoir,) Dwells near the shadow'd wave, And hears the breeze-bow'd tree-tops sigh, While tears below are flowing, For all the sad and lovely things That to the grave are going! O that I were a primrose, To bask in sunny air! Far, far from all the plagues that make Town-dwelling men despair! Then would I watch the building-birds, Where light and shade are moving, And lovers' whisper, and love's kiss, Rewards the loved and loving! Or that I were a skylark, To soar and sing above, Filling all hearts with joyful sounds, And my own soul with love! Then o'er the mourner and the dead, And o'er the good man dying, My song should come like buds and flowers, When music warbles flying. O that a wing of splendour, Like yon wild cloud, were mine! Yon bounteous cloud, that gets to give, And borrows to resign! On that bright wing, to climes of spring I'd bear all wintry bosoms, And bid hope smile on weeping thoughts, Like April on her blossoms; Or like the rainbow, laughing O'er Rivilin and Don, When misty morning calleth up Her mountains, one by one, While glistening down the golden broom, The gem-like dew-drop raineth, And round the little rocky isles The little wave complaineth. O that the truth of beauty Were married to my rhyme! That it might wear a mountain charm Until the death of Time! Then, Ribbledin! would all the best Of Sorrow's sons and daughters See Truth reflected in my song, Like beauty on thy waters. No longer, nameless streamlet, That marriest Rivilin! Henceforth, lone Nature's devotees Would call thee “Ribbledin,” Whenever, listening where thy voice Its first wild joy expresses, And down the rocks all wildly flows The wildness of thy tresses. THE MALTBY YEWS. Famed Maltby Yews, with trunks like stone! Are you or these grey rocks the older? Like “death-in-life,” ye strangely grow, And, dead alive, they sternly moulder. Memorials grand of death and life, That seem from time new life to borrow! Full many a race have ye outlived Of men whose lives were crime and sorrow. Age after age, while Time grew old, Your writhen boughs, here, slowly lengthen'd; Storm-stricken trees! your stormy strength Five hundred years have darkly strengthen'd. Yet safe beneath your mighty roots The busy bee hath made its dwelling; And, at your feet, the little mouse, With lifted hands, its joy is telling. And, high above the full-voiced lark, The sun that loves to see you, beameth On lonely rock or mossy trunk, That with the rock coeval seemeth; While, all around, the desert flowers, Where breezes drink their freshness, gather, As children come to kneel and bend In prayer around their father's father. O could I write upon your gloom A solemn verse that would not perish, My written thoughts should warn and bless, And nations saved the precept cherish; For I would bid the dark and strong Be greatly good, and daily stronger, That power to wrong, and will to wrong, Like fiends divorced, might pair no longer. BURNS. That heaven's beloved die early, Prophetic Pity mourns; But old as Truth, although in youth, Died giant-hearted Burns. O that I were the daisy That sank beneath his plough, Or, “neighbour meet,” that “skylark sweet!” Say, are they nothing now? That mouse, “our fellow mortal,” Lives deep in Nature's heart; Like earth and sky, it cannot die Till earth and sky depart. Thy Burns, child-honour'd Scotland! Is many minds in one; With thought on thought, the name is fraught Of glory's peasant son. Thy Chaucer is thy Milton, And might have been thy Tell; As Hampden fought, thy Sidney wrote And would have fought as well. Be proud, man-childed Scotland! Of earth's unpolish'd gem; And “Bonny Doon,” and “heaven aboon,” For Burns hath hallow'd them. Be proud, though sin dishonour'd, And grief baptized thy child; As rivers run, in shade and sun, He ran his courses wild. Grieve not, though savage forests Look'd grimly on the wave, Where dim-eyed flowers and shaded bowers Seem'd living in the grave. Grieve not, though, by the torrent, Its headlong course was riven, When o'er it came, in clouds and flame, Niagara from heaven! For sometimes gently flowing, And sometimes chafed to foam, O'er slack and deep, by wood and steep, He sought his heavenly home. THE TRICOLOR CROSS. PARODIED FROM BERANGER'S “CROSS OF THE LEGION OF HONOUR.” Thou took'st thy deep blue from the eyes of the soul, And thy white from the foam of the far rolling sea: But, Cross of the Billows! famed far as they roll, Why stain thy bright red with the blood of the free? Columbia beheld thee flaunt over her slain, When she call'd up the ghosts of Pym, Hampton, and Vane; And steep'd were thy folds in the blood of her brave, When France broke her chain, to dig tyrants a grave. Famed Red Cross of England, famed ever to be! Bright Cross of the Tricolor! when wilt thou wave, A meteor in darkness, from sea unto sea— The symbol of justice, the hope of the slave? Where, where wast thou waving when Poland arose, Crying “God for Sarmatia!” to Liberty's foes? Oh, not o'er the ranks of the sworn-to-be free, Stain'd Cross of the Ocean, stain'd ever to be! Stain'd ever?—No, Ocean! thy Tricolor Cross Shall yet shame the Tricolor dreadfully fair; Through the ranks of th' oppressor its brightness shall toss Defiance and havoc, defeat and despair; O'er the treason of priests, the rebellion of kings, Our halcyon shall rise, with thy blue on his wings, And sport with the billows wherever they roll, Bright, bright as heav'n's depth in the eyes of the soul. THE PILGRIM FATHERS. A voice of grief and anger— Of pity mix'd with scorn— Moans o'er the waters of the west, Through fire and darkness borne; And fiercer voices join it— A wild triumphant yell! For England's foes, on ocean slain, Have heard it where they fell. What is that voice which cometh Athwart the spectred sea? The voice of men who left their homes To make their children free; Of men whose hearts were torches For Freedom's quenchless fire; Of men, whose mothers brave brought forth The sires of Franklin's sire. They speak!—the Pilgrim Fathers Speak to ye from their graves! For earth hath mutter'd to their bones That we are soulless slaves! The Bradfords, Carvers, Winslows, Have heard the worm complain, That less than men oppress the men Whose sires were Pym and Vane! What saith the voice which boometh Athwart th' upbraiding waves? “Though slaves are ye, our sons are free, Then why will you be slaves? The children of your fathers Were Hampden, Pym, and Vane!” Land of the sires of Washington, Bring forth such men again! A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE. An old man, to the field of graves Borne, in his parish-shroud, methought, Found, in the land of landless slaves, The bed of rest, which long he sought. But, after many years had flown, That old man rose out of his grave, And wonder'd at his native town, And found no honest man a slave. Where once that town of trouble stood, And he the tyrant's frown had felt, Men in sweet homes, by stream and wood, Amid their own green acres dwelt. Nor hovel now, nor temple was, Where hovels once and temples stood; All, all had perish'd! for, alas! Redemption had been steep'd in blood! Remote, an engined city groan'd Where bad men toil'd in penal gloom; The Agnews there the Pelhams moan'd, The Melvilles plied the penal loom. Tyrants, not victims, justly bound To labour's chain, alone were slaves: And no good man was landless found In this sad land, where men have graves. But things which penal toil had wrought, Converting crime itself to good, The blessings of all climates brought To those sweet homes, by stream and wood. Instinct with life, almost they seem'd, And came and went, when call'd or sent By tranquil thought, that star-like beam'd On each untiring instrument. Not only by his toiling hands, But chiefly by his god-like mind, Man, sowing bliss, in distant lands, Made earth a garden for mankind. THE BALLOT. The sky had no voice, and the ocean was still— A power and a terror chain'd valley and hill; For the spirit of Burns, upon thunder-clouds borne, Look'd down on his country in pity and scorn; Because the descendants of Wallace were slow, The bonds they had loosen'd to break at a blow. “What! give back their souls to these freemen enthrall'd? Then give them the ballot!” o'er Scotland he call'd; “Concede it, proud traitors! obtain it, thou thrall— Thou robb'd of the land which the Lord made for all! Obtain it, ye millions, who labour for drones! Concede it, ye despots, who feast on their groans!” The Lords of Misrule and their Master turn'd pale; The tyrant-eyed viper seem'd weak as the snail; The bones of the murder'd for freedom came forth From their far-sever'd graves, with a growl like the north; The martyrs Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Gerald, and Margarot, all died in exile, except the latter, who perished for want of bread in London!!! Of millions awaking the murmur was deep; And the face of the bard was like lightning asleep. So hovers the eagle o'er summits of light, Which, touch'd by his shadow, start up in affright; While, girt by the peaks where the storm sinks to rest, Loch Oich sees Ben Nevis sink down in the west, When o'er the dark glare of the sky-painted lake, Frown Coryuragen and Coriaraick. Two mountains of Scotland near the source of the Ness. ROCH ABBEY GATEWAY. What dost thou here, lorn Ireland's dying daughter? These holy walls, that erst, with open door Welcomed the pilgrim—offering bread and water, Prayer, rest, and counsel, to the way-worn poor— Now mute and barren as the manless moor, Would not, to Christ himself, afford a crumb! Perish, unheard, thou spurn'd of lord and boor! Poor Erin's waif! be Supplication dumb Where Charity is deaf. At hallow'd gates Hop'st thou for succour? Outcast! over them Mourns ivied Ruin; or, within them, waits Obstruction loop'd and ring'd with gold and gem; And Mammon, plotting woe to harpied states, Scowls from beneath his cloven diadem. Fair was she, and her famish'd child was like her; Nought lovelier mourns beneath the laughing skies. As I approach'd, I saw the baby strike her; “I saw a baby beat its dying mother; I had starved the one, and was starving the other!” Coleridge. It raged for food, while tears gushed from her eyes! Why did she marry, in the land of sighs, Where crimes, call'd laws, made by the lawless, named Her child “Benoni?” Let the basely wise Say, rather, why, self-duped and unashamed, They curse God's blessings; and, with blasphemies, Hallow the arrow at our vitals aim'd, Lauding the madness that makes precious things, Yea, things most precious, worthless! Heav'n is blamed, And hope and action droop their palsied wings, Because our lords are bread-tax-eating kings. LEAVES AND MEN. Drop, drop into the grave, Old Leaf, Drop, drop into the grave; Thy acorn's grown, thy acorn's sown— Drop, drop into the grave. December's tempests rave, Old Leaf, Above thy forest-grave, Old Leaf; Drop, drop into the grave! The birds, in spring, will sweetly sing That death alone is sad; The grass will grow, the primrose show That death alone is sad. Lament above thy grave, Old Leaf! For what has life to do with grief? 'Tis death alone that's sad. What then? We two have both lived through The sunshine and the rain; And bless'd be He, to me and thee, Who sent his sun and rain! We've had our sun and rain, Old Leaf, And God will send again, Old Leaf, The sunshine and the rain. Race after race of leaves and men, Bloom, wither, and are gone; As winds and waters rise and fall, So life and death roll on; And long as ocean heaves, Old Leaf, And bud and fade the leaves, Old Leaf, Will life and death roll on. How like am I to thee, Old Leaf! We'll drop together down; How like art thou to me, Old Leaf! We'll drop together down. I'm gray and thou art brown, Old Leaf! We'll drop together down, Old Leaf, We'll drop together down! Drop, drop into the grave, Old Leaf, Drop, drop into the grave; Thy acorn's grown, thy acorn's sown— Drop, drop into the grave. December's tempests rave, Old Leaf, Above thy forest grave, Old Leaf; Drop, drop into the grave! WILLIAM. “Lift, lift me up! my broken heart Must speak before I go: O Mother! it is death to part From you—I love you so! “The doctor shunn'd my eyes, and brook'd Few words from my despair; But through and through his heart I look'd, And saw my coffin there. “You did not tell me I should die, You fear'd your child would grieve; But I am dying! One is nigh Whom kindness can't deceive. “The dim light sickens round my bed, Your looks seem sick with woe, The air feels sick, as, o'er my head Its pantings come and go. “Oh, I am sick in every limb, Sick, sick in every vein! My eyes and brain with sickness swim, My bones are sick with pain! “What is this weary helplessness, This breathless toil for breath? This tossing aching weariness— What is it?—It is Death! “Mother, I feel as in a dream; My dark'ning senses reel, Like moonlight on a troubled stream: This cannot last, I feel. “Yet, it has lasted—Oh, how long This sick dream seems to me! My God! why is my weakness strong To bear such agony? “'Tis sad to quit a world so fair, To warm young hearts like mine; And, doom'd so early, hard to bear This heavy hand of thine. “I, like a youngling from the nest, By rude hands torn away, Would fain cling to my mother's breast— But cannot, must not, stay. “From her and hers, and our sweet home, My soul seems forced afar, O'er frozen seas of sable foam, Through gloom without a star. “I go where voice was never heard, Where sunbeam ne'er was seen, Where dust beholds nor flow'r nor bird, As if life ne'er had been! “I go where Thomas went before; I hear him sob ‘Prepare!’ And I have borne what Thomas bore: Who knows what he can bear? “Farewell!—farewell! to meet again! But, oh, why part to meet? I know my mother's heart is fain To share my winding-sheet! “Can't you die with me, mother? Come And clasp me!—not so fast! How close and airless is the room! O mother!”—It is past! The breath is gone, the soul is flown, The lips no longer move; God o'er my child hath slowly thrown His veil of dreadful love. O thou changed dust! pale form that tak'st All hope from fond complaint! Thou sad mute eloquence, that mak'st The listener's spirit faint. And, oh, ye dreamy fears, that rest On dark realities! Opium-eater. Why preach ye to the trembling breast, Truths which are mysteries. SONG. [Mother! I come from God and bliss] Tune.—“Mary's Dream.” Mother! I come from God and bliss; O bless me with a mother's kiss! Though dead, I spurn the tomb's control, And clasp thee in th' embrace of soul. No terrors daunt, no cares annoy, No tyrants vex thy buried boy; Why mourn for him who smiles on thee? Dear Mother! weep no more for me. Where angels dwell—in glen and grove— I sought the flowers which Mothers love; And in my garden I have set The primrose and the violet: For thee, the woe-mark'd cowslip grows, For thee the little daisy blows; When wilt thou come my flowers to see? Nay, Mother! weep no more for me. Christ's Mother wept on earth for Him, When wept in heaven the Seraphim, And, o'er the Eternal Throne, the light Grew dim, and sadden'd into night; But where through bliss heaven's rivers run, That Mother now is with her Son; They miss me there, and wait for thee— Come, Mother, come! why weep for me? I set a rose our home beside— I know the poor memorial died; The frost hath chipp'd my letter'd stone; My very name from earth is gone! But in my bower, that knows not woe, The wild hedge-rose and woodbine glow, And red-breasts sing of home to me: Come, Mother, come! we wait for thee. SONG. [Man-like her lover was to see] Man-like her lover was to see, But stern and cold of soul was he, Of cold and sordid kindred born; And when he found the maid was poor, He pass'd in scorn her decent door, He dug her grave with scorn. Unstain'd as vernal snow, she died; Like snow, that melts on Rother's side, When April's sun in trouble sets: Her life was but a day of showers; And, oh, it closed o'er songless bowers And drooping violets! FOOTPATHS. The poor man's walk they take away, The solace of his only day, Where now, unseen, the flowers are blowing, And, all unheard, the stream is flowing! In solitude unbroken, Where rill and river glide, The lover's elm, itself a grove, Laments the absent voice of love; How bless'd I oft sat there with Fanny, When tiny Jem and little Annie Were fairies at my side! O dew-dropp'd rose! O woodbine! They close the bowery way, Where oft my father's father stray'd, And with the leaves and sunbeams play'd, Or, like the river by the wild wood, Ran with that river, in his childhood, The gayest child of May! Where little feet o'er bluebells, Pursued the sun-bless'd bee, No more the child-loved daisy hears The voice of childhood's hopes and fears; Thrush! never more, by thy lone dwelling, Where fountain'd vales thy tale are telling, Will childhood startle thee? The poor man's path they take away, His solace on the Sabbath day; The sick heart's dewy path of roses, Where day's eye lingers ere it closes! TO HOFLAND, THE ARTIST. Go, Bard and Painter! to the desert. Limn The mountain's soul, and bid that spirit stay. So shall thy canvas be a glowing hymn To God, in his great works; sung every day By every eye that sees it with the heart, While age-long years grow grey, and rock-built pomps depart. ON A HEARTLESS SLANDERER. “The unco guid” should pray with tears, That thou may'st live a thousand years, To hunt out flaws, and snarl, and laugh, And then write Virtue's epitaph. EPIGRAM. [Life is short, and time is swift] Life is short, and time is swift, Roses fade, and shadows shift; But the ocean and the river Rise and fall and flow for ever: Bard! not vainly heaves the ocean; Bard! not vainly flows the river; Be thy song then like their motion. Blessing now, and blessing ever. A POET. Child of the Hopeless! two hearts broke When thou wast orphan'd here: They left a treasure in thy breast, The soul of Pity's tear. And thou must be—not what thou wilt;— Say then, what would'st thou be? “A Poet!” Oh, if thou would'st steep Deep thoughts in ecstasy, Nor poet of the rich be thou, Nor poet of the poor; Nor harper of the swarming town, Nor minstrel of the moor; But be the bard of all mankind, The prophet of all time, And tempt the saints in heav'n to steal Earth's truth-created rhyme. Be the Columbus of a world Where wisdom knows not fear; The Homer of a race of men Who need not sword and spear. God in thy heart, and God in them, If thou to men canst show, Thou makest mortals angels here, Their home a heav'n below. Upon a rock thou sett'st thy feet, And callest Death thy slave: “Here lies a man!” Eternity Shall write upon thy grave; “A Bard lies here!—O softly tread, Ye never-wearied years! And bless, O World, a memory Immortal as thy tears!” THE SINLESS CAIN. A BALLAD. What is that flesh-bound spectre, Whose thoughts none understand? The sleeping mastiff heareth The shunn'd of every land. The spirit in his famish'd eyes, Seems bare to sun and sky; And insolence grows mad with pride, When that sad form comes nigh. In every clime and country There lives a man of pain, Whose nerves, like chords of lightning, Bring fire into his brain; To him a whisper is a wound, A look or sneer a blow; More pangs he feels in years or months Than dunce-throng'd ages know. Yet Pity speaks, like Hatred, Of him, where'er he goes; As if his soul were marble, Men polish it with woes. Though soft and warm as “weeping blood,” And true, his heart, as truth, They coffin winter in his thoughts, And crown with snow his youth. He drinks the wine of curses, He eats reproach for bread, The fire unblown of slander Is flame upon his head: So, in to-morrow's unmade grave, He counts life's heavy hours; While rancour makes his bed of snakes, And mockery calls them flowers. Amid the bless'd a stranger, Or foodless with his mate; From home and hope an exile, Or paid for love with hate; All lonely by some throng'd fireside, Or homeless in his home; Well may he wish to herd with wolves, Or marry ocean's foam. “Why was I given in marriage? Said Love, when he was born: Behold him! the Benoni Of glory's natal morn! The mind of man shall be his shroud; His life is deathless death; Bleach'd on the surge of endless years, He sighs—and hath no breath. Why marvel that his spirit Seems dry as dead men's bones? That maidens fear his gestures, And start to hear his tones? Why marvel that, with maniac steps, He moveth fast and slow, If he was call'd a man of grief Six thousand years ago? By Babylonian rivers, In Israel's dreadful day, With soul bow'd like the willows, For prostrate Solyma, He, saddest, sweetest bard of all Whom God's dark wing had swept From pride into captivity, Remembering Zion, wept. Ere Rome was, he wrote ballads On Troy, the fate-o'erthrown; And he will sigh for London, In manless ruin strown; Then o'er Australia, hungering, Poor waif of land and sea, Ask bread through valleys yet unbuilt, Where London is to be. Or from some Pandour'd palace, That looks o'er slaves afar, Say to his royal legions— “Go, tame the earth with war!” That unborn scribes may write again The tale of chain'd or free, Unless mankind, meantime, recant Their blood-idolatry. Behold him! say what art thou Whose thoughts none understand? The sleeping mastiff hears thee, Thou scorn'd of every land. Famine, that laid thy vitals bare To wind, and sun, and sky, Sees nothing sadder than thy cheek, Or wilder than thine eye. What art thou? Did thy boyhood Cull shells on Severn's side? Art thou “the wondrous stripling That perish'd in his pride?” Or art thou he whom wonder call'd The Avonian's youthful peer, The second Shakspeare? Bread! O Bread! Poor Otway!—it is here. Thou changest—Art thou Dante, The famed in peace and war, Whom weeps ungrateful Florence, Beneath her mournful star? Then hast thou known “how sad the sound Of feet on strangers' stairs— How bitter strangers' bread” to him Who eats it, and despairs! Thou changest—Trampled Hargraves! Rejoin thy nameless dust; Not even to the lifeless Will cruel man be just. Changed! thought-worn Crompton! thy sad face Casts gloom on cloudless day; Fool, even in death! why linger here, Trade's meek reproach?—away! Thou changest—Art thou Byron, Who barter'd peace for stone? And did'st thou wed a shadow, To perish all alone? Changed! Art thou he, once many-thron'd, Who wifeless, sonless, died, While son and wife, walk'd, clad in smiles, His paltry foe beside! Again thou changest. Sad one! How want-worn is thine hand! No diadem thou wearest, Thou scorn'd of every land! The eagle in thy famish'd eyes, Looks faintly on the sky; And insult waxeth red with rage, When thy pale form draws nigh. EPISTLE TO G. C. HOLLAND, ESQ., M.D., WITH MRS. LOUDON'S “PHILANTHROPIC ECONOMY; OR, THE PHILOSOPHY OF HAPPINESS.” Doctor, I send you, with this scrawl, A thing by no means common; For, by the Power that made us all, I send—a perfect woman! I do not praise her cheek's rich hue, Her dress, her air of fashion; I say not that the soul's deep blue Melts in her eye of passion; But I commend her to the heart On which your own reposes, Because her stern worth can impart A grace like rain on roses; And teach parental flowers to teach The love of gainful duty To every plant within her reach, And all their buds of beauty. The meek-tress'd angel of your home May take to her own bosom Thoughts bright and pure as ocean's foam, And fresh as morning's blossom. Nor need she dread a rival's look, Or hate a rival's merit: I send—a woman in a book! A world-awaking spirit! A charm! a host! a scourge! a sting! By tyrants seen with sadness! A truth-taught Power! whose mental wing Shall smite them into madness! Oh, thanks to Loudon and to thee, Sword-breaking might of letters! Enfranchised woman shall set free The slave who forged her fetters! For Truth is freedom unto those Whose souls have strength to seize her; They play a game which none can lose, Who seek her Ebenezer. THE BROKEN HEART. Stop, passenger! for I am weak, And heavy are my failing feet— Stop! till I gather strength to speak: Twice have I seen thee cross the street, Where woe and wild-flowers seldom meet. O give a pallid flower to her Who ne'er again will see one grow! Give me a primrose, passenger! That I may bless it ere I go To my false love, in death laid low. Sweet—sweet! it breathes of Rother's bowers, Where, like the stream, my childhood play'd; And, happy as the birds and flowers, My love and I together strayed, Far from the dim town's deadly shade. Why did he leave my mother's cot? My days of trouble then began: I followed—but he knew me not! The stripling had become a man! And now in heaven he waits for Ann. Back from consumption's streeted gloom, To death's green fields, I fain would fly; In yon churchyard there is no room For broken-hearted flowers to sigh, And look on heaven before they die. SATURDAY. To-morrow will be Sunday, Ann— Get up, my child, with me; Thy father rose at four o'clock To toil for me and thee. The fine folks use the plate he makes, And praise it when they dine; For John has taste—so we'll be neat, Altho' we can't be fine. Then let us shake the carpet well, And wash and scour the floor, And hang the weather-glass he made Beside the cupboard door. And polish thou the grate, my love; I'll mend the sofa arm; The autumn winds blow damp and chill; And John loves to be warm. And bring the new white curtain out, And string the pink tape on— Mechanics should be neat and clean: And I'll take heed for John. And brush the little table, child, And fetch the ancient books— John loves to read; and, when he reads, How like a king he looks! And fill the music-glasses up With water fresh and clear; To-morrow, when he sings and plays, The street will stop to hear. And throw the dead flowers from the vase, And rub it till it glows; For in the leafless garden yet He'll find a winter rose. And lichen from the wood he'll bring, And mosses from the dell; And from the sheltered stubble-field, The scarlet pimpernell. HOLIDAY. O blessèd! when some holiday Brings townsmen to the moor, And, in the sunbeams, brighten up The sad looks of the poor. The bee puts on his richest gold, As if that worker knew— How hardly (and for little) they Their sunless task pursue. But from their souls the sense of wrong On dove-like pinion flies; And, throned o'er all, Forgiveness sees His image in their eyes. Soon tired, the street-born lad lies down On marjoram and thyme, And through his grated fingers sees The falcon's flight sublime; Then his pale eyes, so bluely dull, Grow darkly blue with light, And his lips redden like the bloom O'er miles of mountains bright. The little lovely maiden-hair Turns up its happy face, And saith unto the poor man's heart, “Thou'rt welcome to this place.” The infant river leapeth free, Amid the bracken tall, And cries, “FOR EVER there is One Who reigneth over all; And unto Him, as unto me, Thou'rt welcome to partake His gift of light, his gift of air, O'er mountain, glen, and lake. Our Father loves us, want-worn man! And know thou this from me: The pride that makes thy pain his couch, May wake to envy thee. Hard, hard to bear are want and toil, As thy worn features tell; But wealth is armed with fortitude, And bears thy sufferings well.” SONG. [Nor alehouse scores, nor alehouse broils] Nor alehouse scores, nor alehouse broils Turn my good woman pale; For in my pantry I've a keg Of home-brewed ale. The devil keeps a newspaper Where tavern-wranglers rail, Because it tempts his doomed and lost To drink bad ale. But I read news at second-hand, Nor find it flat and stale; While Hume's or Hindley's health I drink In home-brew'd ale. My boys and girls delight to see My friends and me regale, While Nancy, curtsying, deigns to sip Our home-brew'd ale; And when the widow'd pauper comes, To tell her monthly tale, I sometimes cheer her with a drop Of home-brew'd ale; It tells her heart of better days, Ere she grew thin and pale, When James, before the banker fail'd, Drank home-brew'd ale. I'll melt no money in my drink, Where ruffians fight and rail: The gauger never dipp'd his stick In my cheap ale. But when we household suffrage get, And honest men prevail; Then, hey, mechanics, for free trade, And cheaper ale! RUB OR RUST. Idler, why lie down to die? Better rub than rust. Hark! the lark sings in the sky— “Die when die thou must! Day is waking, leaves are shaking, Better rub than rust.” In the grave there's sleep enough— “Better rub than rust: Death, perhaps, is hunger-proof, Die when die thou must; Men are mowing, breezes blowing, Better rub than rust.” He who will not work shall want; Nought for nought is just— Won't do, must do, when he can't; “Better rub than rust. Bees are flying, sloth is dying, Better rub than rust.” THE HOME OF TASTE. You seek the home of taste, and find The proud mechanic there, Rich as a king, and less a slave, Throned in his elbow-chair! Or on his sofa reading Locke, Beside his open door! This is not an overcharged picture of the condition of some of the mechanics of Sheffield. Why start?—why envy worth like his The carpet on his floor? You seek the home of sluttery— “Is John at home?” you say. “No, sir; he's at the ‘Sportsman's Arms;’ The dog-fight's o'er the way.” O lift the workman's heart and mind Above low sensual sin! Give him a home! the home of taste! Outbid the house of gin! O that I could express in rhyme this sentiment, as it came, clothed in beauty and holiness, from the lips of Dr. Knight, at our last cutlers' feast! O give him taste! it is the link Which binds us to the skies— A bridge of rainbows, thrown across The gulph of tears and sighs; Or like a widower's little one— An angel in a child— That leads him to her mother's chair, And shows him how she smiled. THE SUMMER-HOUSE. Go, Mary, to the summer-house, And sweep the wooden floor, And light the little fire, and wash The pretty varnish'd door; For there the London gentleman, Who lately lectured here, Will smoke a pipe with Jonathan, And taste our home-brew'd beer. Go, bind the dahlias, that our guest May praise their fading dyes; But strip of every wither'd bloom The flower that won the prize! And take thy father's knife, and prune The roses that remain; And let the fallen hollyhock Peep through 'the broken pane. And spunge his view of Blacklowscar, Till bright, on moor and town, The painted sun, and stormy crest, O'er leagues of cloud look down. He rose at three, to work till four— The evenings still are long— And still for every lingering flower The redbreast hath a song. I'll follow in an hour or two; Be sure I will not fail To bring his flute and spying-glass, The pipes and bottled ale; And that grand music which he made About the child in bliss; Our guest shall hear it sung and play'd, And feel how grand it is! SONG. [Let idlers despair! there is hope for the wise] Let idlers despair! there is hope for the wise, Who rely on their own hearts and hands; And we read in their souls, by the flash of their eyes, That our land is the noblest of lands. Let knaves fear for England, whose thoughts wear a mask, While a war on our trenchers they wage; Free trade and no favour is all that we ask! Fair play, and the world for a stage! Secure in their baseness, the lofty and bold Look down on their victims beneath; Like snow on a skylight, exalted and cold, They shine o'er the shadow of death; In the warm sun of knowledge, that kindles our blood, And fills our cheer'd spirits with day, Their splendour, contemn'd by the brave and the good, Like a palace of ice melts away. Our compass, which married the East to the West, Our press, which makes many minds one, Our steam-sinew'd giant that toils without rest, Proclaim that our perils are gone. We want but the right, which the God of the right Denies not to birds and to bees; The charter of Nature! that bids the wing'd light Fly chainless as winds o'er the seas. SONG. [With hair grown grey, we look behind] With hair grown grey, we look behind On passions whose wild reign is o'er— Virtues, whose failure stings the mind, And troubles that molest no more: Slow pass'd the days of toil and care; Yet, oh! how fast they seem to fly, When we look back on our despair, And call it hope, yet know not why. And still they pass, and shade on shade Deepens, their woe-mark path along; But Thou, O God! art strong to aid; Ay, and in Thee the weak are strong. SONG. [Free Trade, like religion, hath doctrines of love] Free Trade, like religion, hath doctrines of love, And the promise of plenty and health; It proclaims, while the angels look down from above, The marriage of Labour and Wealth. Free Trade, like religion, hath doctrines of peace, Universal as God's vital air; And, throned o'er doom'd evil, he hails its increase, While his enemies only despair. By all who their blood on Truth's altars resign'd, To enfranchise a sin-fetter'd race! Our sons shall be freed from the curse of the blind, And redeem'd from the bonds of the base. The ark of our triumph, far, far as seas roll, Shall ride o'er the wealth-freighted waves; The chain'd of the drones be the chainless in soul, And tyrants made men by their slaves. The hall of our fathers, with heav'n for its dome, And the steps of its portals the sea— Of labour and comfort will then be the home, And the temple where worship the Free. SONG. [O'er Polonia's plains of glory] O'er Polonia's plains of glory, Freedom tower'd—a stately tree; From all storms, a sky of branches Shelter'd mine and shelter'd me. Underneath the tree of ages, Many a merry song sung we; Carved his rind, and kiss'd his shadow; Oh, we loved the glorious tree! Now, alas! no sky of branches Shelters mine and shelters me! Now, alas! the tree of Poland Low is fall'n, as low can be! And, as on Euphrates' waters, When the mournful moonbeam slept, Israel's wanderers, sad for Zion, With the weeping willows wept, So we mourn, and, all unheeded, Make our roof the unpillar'd sky; So we roam, and friendless, hopeless, Shed the tear of memory. THE WINTER SPEEDWELL. Ye wintry flowers, whose pensive dyes Wake when the summer's lily sleeps! Ye are like orphans, in whose eyes Their low-laid mother's beauty weeps. Oh, not like stars that come at eve, Through dim clouds glimmering one by one, And teach the failing heart to grieve, Because another day is gone! But like the hopes that linger yet Upon the grave of sorrow's love, And dare Affection to forget The form below, the soul above; Or like the thoughts that bid Despair Repose in faith on Mercy's breast; Givers of wings—from toil and care— To fly away and be at rest! A GHOST AT NOON. The day was dark, save when the beam Of noon through darkness broke; In gloom I sate, as in a dream, Beneath my orchard oak; Lo! splendour, like a spirit, came, A shadow like a tree! While there I sat, and named her name, Who once sat there with me. I started from the seat in fear; I look'd around in awe; But saw no beauteous spirit near, Though all that was I saw; The seat, the tree, where oft, in tears, She mourn'd her hopes o'erthrown, Her joys cut off in early years, Like gather'd flowers half-blown. Again the bud and breeze were met, But Mary did not come; And e'en the rose, which she had set, Was fated ne'er to bloom! The thrush proclaim'd, in accents sweet, The winter's reign was o'er; The bluebells throng'd around my feet, But Mary came no more. I think, I feel—but when will she Awake to thought again? A voice of comfort answers me, That God does nought in vain: He wastes nor flower, nor bud, nor leaf, Nor wind, nor cloud, nor wave; And will He waste the hope which grief Hath planted in the grave? SONG. [Like a rootless rose or lily] Like a rootless rose or lily; Like a sad and life-long sigh; Like a bird pursued and weary, Doom'd to flutter till it die; Landless, restless, joyless, hopeless, Gasping still for bread and breath, To their graves by trouble hunted, Albion's helots toil for death. Tardy day of hoarded ruin, Wild Niagara of blood! Coming sea of headlong millions, Vainly seeking work and food! Why is famine reaped for harvest? Planted curses always grow; Where the plough makes want its symbol, Fools will gather as they sow. SONG. [Sleep, sleep my love! thy gentle bard] Sleep, sleep my love! thy gentle bard Shall wake, his fever'd maid to guard: The moon in heaven rides high; The dim stars through thy curtains peep; Whilst thou, poor sufferer, triest to sleep, They hear thy feeble cry. She sleeps! but pain, though baffled, streaks, With intermitting blush, her cheeks, And haunts her troubled dream: Yet shalt thou wake to health, my love, And seek again the bluebell'd grove And music-haunted stream. HE WENT. He left me sad, and cross'd the deep, A home for me to seek; He never will come back again; My heart, my heart will break! To see me toil for scanty food, He could not bear, he said, But promised to come back again, His faithful Ann to wed. Bad men had turn'd into a hell The country of his birth; And he is gone who should have stay'd To make it heaven on earth: A heaven to me it would have been Had he remain'd with me; O bring my William back again, Thou wild heart-breaking sea! He should have stay'd to overthrow The men who do us wrong; When such as he fly far away, They make oppressors strong: But, oh, though worlds of cruel waves Between our torn hearts rise, My William, thou art present still Before my weeping eyes. Why hast thou sought a foreign land, And left me here to weep? Man! man! thou should'st have sent our foes Beyond that dismal deep! For when I die, who then will toil, My mother's life to save? What hope will then remain for her? A trampled workhouse grave! HE WROTE. He did not come, but letters came, And money came in one; But he would quickly come, they said— “When I,” she sigh'd, “am gone!” Thenceforth she almost welcomed death, With feelings high and brave; Because she knew that her true love Would weep upon her grave. “No parish hirelings,” oft she said, “My wasted corpse shall bear; The honest labour of my hands Hath purchased earth and prayer: Nor childless will my mother be;” The dying sufferer smiled; “Thou wilt not want, for William's heart Is wedded to thy child!” But Death seem'd loath to strike a form So beautiful and young; And o'er her long, with lifted dart, The pensive tyrant hung; And life in her seem'd like a sleep, As she drew nearer home; But when she waked, more eagerly She ask'd, “Is William come?” “Is William come?” she wildly ask'd; The answer still was, “No!”— She's dead!—but through her closing lids The tears were trickling slow; And like the fragrance of a rose, Whose snowy life is o'er, Pale beauty linger'd on the lips Which he will kiss no more. HE CAME. At length he came. None welcomed him; The decent door was closed; But near it stood a matron meek, With pensive looks, composed: She knew his face, though it was changed, And gloom came o'er her brow; “They're gone,” she said, “but you're in time; They're in the churchyard now.” He reach'd the grave, and sternly bade The impatient shovel wait: “Ann Spencer, agèd twenty-five,” He read upon the plate. “Why did'st thou seek a foreign land, And leave me here to die?” The sad inscriptions seem'd to say— But he made no reply. Her mother saw him through her tears, But not a word she said— Nor could he know that days had pass'd Since last she tasted bread. She stood in comely mourning there, Self-stay'd in her distress; The dead maid's toil bought earth and prayer; Sleep on, proud Britoness! But thou, meet parent of the dead! Where now wilt thou abide? With William in a foreign land; Or by thy daughter's side? Oh! William's broken heart is sworn To cross no more the foam! Full soon will men cry—“Hark! again! Three now! they're all at home!” ON THE DEATH OF EARL FITZWILLIAM. O ye who died, trampled, at Peterloo, By England's Juggernaut! Ye too who drank Slowly life's bitterest cup, not drugg'd with rue, But brimm'd with hopeless pain; and ye who sank In blood at Wexford, rolling rank o'er rank, Like storm-swept waves! the golden door throw wide, (It needs no golden key,) and hail and thank The meek, the merciful, who ne'er denied His aid to want and grief, when they for succour cried. But ye who plough the flint with curses! ye Who scalding tears o'er wrongs inflicted weep, And drink them from your eyes of misery, To quench with fire the burning soul, or creep To cold discomfort's bed, and, dreaming, steep Your straw in agonies! keep, pallid slaves, Who still wear chains! your worm that dies not keep! And kneeling, in your hearts, on tyrants' graves, Swear deathless hate to them, their gods, their fools and knaves. SABBATH MORNING. Rise, young Mechanic! Idle darkness leaves The dingy town, and cloudless morning glows: O rise and worship Him who spins and weaves Into the petals of the hedge-side rose Day's golden beams and all-embracing air! Rise! for the morn of Sabbath riseth fair! The clouds expect thee—Rise! the stonechat hops Among the mosses of thy granite chair: Go tell the plover, on the mountain tops, That we have cherish'd nests and hidden wings. Wings? Ay, like those on which the seraph flings His sun-bright speed from star to star abroad; And we have Music, like the whisperings Of streams in Heav'n—our labour is an ode Of sweet sad praise to Him who loves the right. And cannot He who spins the beauteous light, And weaves the air into the wild flowers hues, Give to thy soul the mountain torrent's might, Or fill thy veins with sunbeams, and diffuse Over thy thoughts the greenwood's melody? Yea, this and more He can and will for thee, If thou wilt read, engraven on the skies And restless waves, that “sloth is misery; And that our worth from our necessities Flows, as the rivers from his clouds descend!” TASTE. When, o'er her dying child, we hear The hopeless mother sigh; “There is a better world,” we sob; “Can such affection die?” Perhaps it can—for wolves and worms Have their affections too; And passion sometimes loves the false Even better than the true. But Taste, in its infinity, Its beauty, and its might, Walks thro' the beams of common day In robes of heavenly light: A spirit—ay, a deathless Eve, To man's pure bosom given: They meet—earth's Eden is not lost! They part—to meet in Heaven! What power like that which turns to bliss The mournful and the dull, And from the dust beneath our feet Calls up the beautiful, Can bid the hopes of frailty soar, Undying life, to thee? Pride dies with man; but Taste predicts His immortality. THE WOODBINES OF JUNE. Broom glow'd in the valley, For William and Sally, The rose with the rill was in tune; Love fluttering their bosoms, As breezes the blossoms, They stray'd thro' the woodbines of June. Oft, oft he caress'd her, And to his heart press'd her, The rose with the woodbine was twined; Her cheek on his bosom, Like dew on the blossom, Enchanted the tale-telling wind. Poor Sally was bonny, But Mary had money, Ay, money, and beauty beside; And wilt thou, sweet Mary, Thou fond and unwary, Deprive the wise fool of his bride? Yes, bee-haunted valley! Poor heart-broken Sally No more, with her William, will stray— “He marries another! I'm dying!—O mother! Take, take that sweet woodbine away!” THE REJECTED. His hand clasp'd in hers, she look'd up in the face That once gazed as fondly on me; Two boys and a girl, in their butterfly chase, Ran before them with laughter and glee. He saw me—he knew me—his brown cheek turn'd pale, “Oh, still doth he love me?” I sigh'd; But my heart how it sank! and I felt my knees fail, As I look'd on his beautiful bride. In their comely attire, and their calm thankful air, The tale of their virtues was told; While, childless and mateless, in want and despair, Was the woman who spurn'd him for gold. Oh, even at the altar, when coldly I gave My hand to the thing I had bought, Remorse told my heart, in a voice from my grave, That I barter'd a shadow for nought! Nought! call ye it nought to applaud what ye hate? To honour, yet feign to contemn? To borrow of servants? and, apeing the great, Envy all that's look'd down on by them? Till at last; but, O Henry! my doom I could bear, Might I know that thou weepest for me; And feel, while the robe of my weaving I wear, That I still am remember'd by thee? That while thou tread'st humbly, with truth for thy stay, The path that to competence led, Thou pitiest the proud one who threw thee away, And think'st of her desolate bed. RAINBOWED MAY. Now, over violets the chaffinch hops, And bursts of sunshine startle wood and copse, With bluebells gay; For heav'n is dim with showers, and mountain-tops Look down on rainbow'd May: Haste then, mechanic, take thy spade and hoes; Haste to thy garden, while thy soul o'erflows With hope and joy; And with thee take, rejoicing as he goes, Thy heart-awaken'd boy. Lo! his cheek reddens as he lifts his eyes! He grasps his rusted rake with joyful cries And sinews stark; And to his shout his smoke-dried dog replies, With dusty frisk and bark; For to the garden, where the red-breast hops, Through gleams of light that startle wood and copse They take their way; While, bathed in dewy air, the mountain tops Look down on rainbow'd May. THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST EMIGRANT. Upon the dreadful battle-field, methought, High on Breed's Hill, after the fight was done, Amid the dead, yet fearing not the dead, I stood before a form, that sadden'd night. “Featureless presence! Are thy tresses mist? Or hast thou lineaments? The blast unveils thee, Visage of mystery! and swirls the cloud That seems thy carpet.” From the earth it rose Slow, from a nameless tomb, with human gore Polluted in the fight of yesterday, Nor scatter'd the red death-dews from a flower; A dim form, mingling with the tempest's light, All indistinct, as the moon's shrouded beams, Seen thro' the snow flakes, when they fluttering fall, Muffling the mountain echoes silently. The seeming brow was turn'd to heav'n, the hands In deprecation waved. “Cloud-involved moon! Stars, that from earth's blood-bolter'd face withdraw Your blasted beams,” exclaim'd a hollow voice; “For peace I cross'd the sable rolling seas, Left country, friends, all, but my God, for peace To worship Him in truth and purity. I first, from persecution flying, rear'd The white man's home amid Columbian woods, God's altar, in the unhewn temple wild Of Nature. There, where bright Connecticut Waters a sin-found Eden, with my sons I kneel'd, and gave the God of deserts praise. I kiss'd their hands; I bade them live in love, And sometimes think of me; and then I slept. They wept; they dug, near ocean's echoing shore, My narrow bed of rest; and unknown flowers Bloom'd o'er it, drooping lonely. But the blood Of murder hath profaned the shuddering tomb, And call'd the slumberer from his bed of worms. In vain for peace, for peace I cross'd the seas, And vainly left, far east, my mother's grave; Nor may my children's children dwell in peace, Nor worship God in truth and purity.” HANNAH RATCLIFFE. If e'er she knew an evil thought, She spoke no evil word. Peace to the gentle! she hath sought The bosom of her Lord. She lived to love, and loved to bless Whatever He hath made; But early on her gentleness His chastening hand He laid. Like a maim'd linnet, nursed with care, She graced a home of bliss; And dwelt in thankful quiet there, To show what goodness is. Her presence was a noiseless power, That sooth'd us day by day— A modest, meek, secluded flower, That smiled, and pass'd away. So meek she was, that, when she died, We miss'd the lonely one, As when we feel, on Loxley's side, The silent sunshine gone. But memory brings to sunless bowers The light they knew before; And Hannah's quiet smile is ours, Though Hannah is no more. Her pale face visits yet my heart And oft my guest will be; O White Rose! thou shalt not depart; But wither here with me. THE WAY BROAD-LEAF. When Winter howls along the hill, We find the broad-leaf'd plantain still; The way broad-leaf, of herbs the chief, We never miss the way broad-leaf; 'Tis common as the poor. To soothe the cruel scorner's woes, Beneath the scorner's feet it grows; Neglected, trampled, still it thrives, A creature of unnumber'd lives; How like the trampled poor! When roses die, it still remains; Hoof-crush'd, beneath unpitying rains, Roll'd o'er by ringing carts and wains, It suffers still, but ne'er complains; Just like the helpless poor! Scorn'd by the bluebells—or bent o'er Their graves beneath the sycamore— Meek, modest, silent, useful still, It loves to do the gentle will Of Him who loves the poor! PROLOGUE TO WATT TYLER. A PLAY, BY JOHN WATKINS. While they whose sordid lusts oppress a state, Forestall, because they dread, the public hate, Slow to resent are nations; man endures The curse of bondage, better than he cures. We tremble when the ocean, white with foam, Hails the deep voice of rivers roaring home, And the black sky, which fire's wild instinct rends, Like a Niagara of clouds descends; But calm succeeds, the mountain'd plain subsides, In music soon the meeken'd river glides, And when the wholesome hurricane is o'er, Earth wears a look more lovely than before. Not always thus, when nations, stung to rage, On kings and priests a war of vengeance wage; E'en though triumphant, oft with ruin fraught, The human tempest strengthens what it smote; O'er rout or victory, derision names A Louis Philippe, or a second James; A Cromwell or Napoleon, cursed with might, Turns hope to darkness, with portentous light, Plague from the enthusiast's sinless Eden brings, And plumed by Freedom, tramples on her wings. Too seldom, if the righteous fight is won, Rebellion boasts a Tell or Washington; But if the champion of the People fail, Foes only live to tell Misfortune's tale, And meanness blots, while none to praise is nigh, The hero's virtues, with a coward's lie. To-night we bring, from his insulted grave, A man too honest to become a slave: How few admire him! few, perhaps, bewail'd! He was a vulgar hero—for he fail'd: Such glorious honours soothe the patriot's shade! Of such materials History is made! But had his followers triumph'd, where he fell Fame would have hymn'd her village Hampden well, And Watt the Tyler been a William Tell. SONG. [Bright Word of God! that shin'st on high] Bright Word of God! that shin'st on high, Beneath his footstool of the sky! Thou say'st He made thee bright for all, For rich and poor, for great and small; And canst thou lie? Lo! on the prisoner's dungeon'd eye, Cut off from heaven's warm blasonry, Thy beams of glory cannot fall! Yet say'st thou, light was made for all; And dost thou lie? The sons of Want and Labour sigh For air, for light, and, poison'd, die! Life is to them a funeral pall! Yet say'st thou, light is bright for all; O do not lie! To thee the lark, the eagle cry, The tiny wren, the little fly; On thee the seas, the mountains call: Thou say'st, God made thee bright for all, And dost not lie. CORONATION ODE. WRITTEN FOR THE SHEFFIELD WORKING MEN'S ASSOCIATION. Victoria, cypress-crown'd! thou good in vain! How the red wreath, with which thy name is bound— The page which tells the first deeds of thy reign, Black and blood-bloated—cheer the Calmuck hound, Whose growl o'er Brunswick hails thee, cypress-crown'd! Canada weeps—and yet her dead are free! Throned o'er their blood! who would not be a Queen? The Queen of new-made graves, who would not be? Of glory's royal flowers the loveliest seen! So young! yet all that the deplored have been! Here too, O Queen, thy woe-worn people feel The load they bear is more than they can bear! Beneath it twenty million workers reel! While fifty thousand idlers rob and glare, And mock the sufferings which they yet may share! The drama soon will end. Four acts are past: The curtain rises o'er embracing foes! But each dark smiler hugs his dagger fast! While Doom prepares his match, and waits the close! Queen of the Earthquake! would'st thou win or lose? Still shall the Car of Juggernaut roll on, O'er broken hearts and children born in vain, Banner'd with fire! while “thousand men as one” Sink down beneath its coward wheels of pain, That crush our souls, through crunching blood and brain! Stop!—for to ruin Antoinette was led, By men, who only when they died awoke! Base nobles who, o'er France vain darkness spread, And, goading her faint steeds with stroke on stroke, Loaded the wain—until the axles broke! Stop!—“for the blasting engine's iron Laws,” Then saved not thrones from outraged Heav'n's control, When hunger urged up to the cannon's jaws A sea of men, with only one wild soul! Hark! still I hear the echo of its roll! VERSES ON THE OPENING OF THE SHEFFIELD AND ROTHERHAM RAILWAY. Forests!—thou river'd landscape wide!— Beneath storm-threatening skies, The morning was clouded, but burst into sudden splendour over the rushing trains. I stand on war-mark'd Winco's side, And see, with gladdened eyes, Another triumph for mankind— Another victory of mind O'er man's worst enemies. They come! the shrieking steam ascends Slow moves the banner'd train; They rush! the towering vapour bends— The kindled wave again Screams over thousands, thronging all To witness now the funeral Of law-created pain. Behold it—Osgathorpe, behold! A beautiful eminence between Sheffield and Winco-bank, and, like the latter, overlooking a landscape of equal beauty. Look down, and cry “All hail!” Skies! brighten into blue and gold, O'er all the living vale! Wan, lingering foxglove! you, ye trees! Thou wood of Tinsley! tell the breeze That hell's dark cheek turns pale; For Mind shall conquer time and space; Bid East and West shake hands! Bring, over Ocean, face to face, Earth's ocean-sever'd strands; And, on his path of iron, bear Words that shall wither, in despair, The tyrants of all lands. Eternal River!—roaring still, As roar'd thy foamy wave When first each wild-rose-skirted rill Heard moorland echoes rave;— Thou seest, amid thy meadows green, The goodliest sight that earth hath seen Since man made fire his slave. Fire-kindling Man! how weak wast thou Ere thou hadst conquer'd fire! How like a worm, on Canklow's brow, Thou shrank'st from winter's ire! Or heard'st the torrent-gathering night Awake the wolf, with thee to fight, Where these broad shades aspire! How dismal was thy airy hall, Thy throne for hearthless kings! But glorious was thy funeral pall; And there are direr things Than thy red-rule of forest law, Thy last home in the raven's maw, Thy hearse of living wings. Yes he whom scorn and hunger ban, Whom ease and law belie, Who vainly asks his fellow man For “leave to toil” and die, Is sadder, weaker, than wast thou, When naked here, on Winco's brow, Thou didst the wolf defy. In vain thou mak'st the air a slave That works and will not tire; And burn'st the flame-destroying wave, And rid'st on harness'd fire; In vain—if millions toil half-fed, And Crompton's children, begging bread, Wealth-hated, curse their sire. Fire-kindling man! thy life-stream runs, Even yet, through sighs and groans: Too long thy Watts and Stephensons, With brains have fatten'd drones; O Genius! all too long, too oft, At thee the souls of clay have scoff'd, And sold thy little ones! Sold them to Misery's dungeon gloom; To Rapine's menial blow; To beggary's brawl-fill'd lodging-room, Where Famine curses woe; Then to the death-den's workhouse floor, To which good Christians bring the poor, By stages sure and slow. But, lo! the train!—On! onward!—still Loud shrieks the kindled wave; And back fly hamlet, tree, and hill, White steam, and banners brave; And thoughts on vapoury wings are hurl'd, To shake old thrones and change a world, And dig Abaddon's grave. Mountains, that were when graves were not! Time-humbled Templestowe, The remains of a fortification at the Ickles, near Rotherham. See Scott's novel of “Ivanhoe.” Thou tell'st of eagled Rome and Scott, What dateless years shall know! Lo! Mind prepares the final fall; The many-nation'd funeral Of law-created woe! Eternal River!—roaring now, As erst, in earlier years, Ere grief began, with youthful brow, To live an age of tears; Thou hear'st, beneath this brightening sky, A voice of Power that will not die While man hath hopes and fears. He, (conquering fire, and time, and space,) Bids East and West shake hands; Brings, over ocean, face to face, Earth's ocean-sever'd strands; And, on his iron road, will bear Words that shall wither, in despair, The tyrants of all lands. HYMN. [Another wave is swallow'd by the sea] Another wave is swallow'd by the sea Of sumless waves! Another year, thou past Eternity, Hath roll'd o'er new-made graves! They open yet—to bid the living weep, Where tears are vain; While I, unswept into the ruthless deep, Storm-tried and sad, remain. Why am I spared? Surely to wear away, By useful deeds, Vile traces, left beneath th' upbraiding spray, Of empty shells and weeds. If there are deeds, which no repentance need, And all can do, Why should one heart with vain contrition bleed, Self-tried, and found untrue? But there are things which time devoureth not; Thoughts, whose green youth Flowers o'er the ashes of the unforgot, And words, whose fruit is truth. Are ye not imaged in the eternal sea, Things of to-day? Deeds which are harvest for Eternity! Ye cannot pass away. TRAFALGAR. Above the howl of ocean And frowning Trafalgar, From bursting cloud, went forth the voice Of elemental war; And, louder than the tempest, From man, the insect, came, Beneath the frown of Trafalgar, His deadly voice of flame. But, ere it rent the blackness Which God's stern brow cast wide, “Now, Victory or Westminster!” Said Nelson, in his pride. “My comrades, do your duty! Or what will England say?” “England expects every man to do his duty.” “They shall!” cried accents from the deep, Where dead men weltering lay. Red Horror tore the tempest; Down stoop'd both sea and sky; And, like a flood on Collingwood, The clouds rush'd from on high. Life pledged for life, arm'd thousands Join'd then in horrid strife. O Life, thou art an awful thing!— For what is God but Life? Shouts, groans, and man's dread thunder, Made up one dismal cry: The affrighted storm ask'd what it meant, And Death made no reply. But, on the grave of thousands, A silent spirit trod; He clasp'd them in th' embrace of Death— And what is Death but God? He cared not for their glory, He ask'd not of their cause; While, right or wrong, the weak and strong Obeyed alike his laws. One tyrant lost his war-ships; Worse tyrants summ'd their gains; And toil-worn nations sang and danced, (As maniacs dance,) in chains! How like an empty bubble The turmoil pass'd away! “Where are the weak?” said sun and cloud— “The mighty!—where are they?” And birds of light and calmness— Where dolphins gamboll'd free, And heroes in their glory lay— Flew over the smooth sea. And, from his throne of silence, The God of Peace look'd down, Though sternly, on their bed of death, With pity in his frown. For Spaniard, Frank, and Briton, All peaceful in one grave, Like babies in their nurses' arms, Slept under the green wave. Image of God! through horrors “That make the angels weep,” Why seek the gift that comes unsought— His boon of dreadful sleep? HYMN. [Nurse of the Pilgrim Sires, who sought] Nurse of the Pilgrim Sires, who sought, Beyond the Atlantic foam, For fearless truth and honest thought, A refuge and a home! Who would not be of them or thee A not unworthy son, That hears, amid the chain'd or free, The name of Washington? Cradle of Shakspeare, Milton, Knox! King-shaming Cromwell's throne! Home of the Russells, Watts, and Lockes! Earth's greatest are thine own: And shall thy children forge base chains For men that would be free? No! by thy Elliots, Hampdens, Vanes, Pyms, Sydneys, yet to be! No!—for the blood which kings have gorged Hath made their victims wise, While every lie that Fraud hath forged Veils wisdom from his eyes: But time shall change the despot's mood: And Mind is mightiest then, When turning evil into good, And monsters into men. If round the soul the chains are bound That hold the world in thrall— If tyrants laugh when men are found In brutal fray to fall— Lord! let not Britain arm her hands, Her sister states to ban; But bless through her all other lands, Thy family of Man. For freedom if thy Hampden fought, For peace if Falkland fell; For peace and love if Bentham wrote, And Burns sang wildly well— Let Knowledge, strongest of the strong, Bid hate and discord cease; Be this the burden of her song: “Love, Liberty, and Peace!” Then, Father, will the nations all, As with the sound of seas, In universal festival, Sing words of joy, like these:— Let each love all, and all be free, Receiving as they give; Lord!—Jesus died for Love and Thee! So let thy children live! LINES. WRITTEN FOR THE SHEFFIELD MECHANICS' FIRST EXHIBITION. Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Come duly, as of old; Winds blow, suns set, and morning saith, “Ye hills, put on your gold!” Gray Stanage and his mountain'd sea Roll, granite-billow'd, ever; And Loxley, Sheaf, and Ewden, leave Their dewy valleys never. The song of Homer liveth; Dead Solon is not dead; Thy splendid name Pythagoras, O'er realms of suns is spread! If Milton's lay could pass from earth, Heaven's bards that lay might cherish; And Watt's great deed hath changed a world, And will not, cannot perish. But Babylon and Memphis Are letters traced in dust:— Read them, earth's tyrants!—ponder well The might in which ye trust! They rose, while all the depths of guilt Their vain creators sounded: They fell, because on fraud and force Their corner-stones were founded. Truth, Mercy, Knowledge, Justice, Are powers that ever stand; They build their temples in the soul, They work with God's right hand; Their sword is thought! the minds they teach Grow daily, hourly wiser; But Memphian Kings found ignorance Their true and last adviser! Then, Trader, Lord, or Yeoman, If thou a patriot art— If thou would'st weep to see the light Of England's name depart, Her streets blood-flooded, and her plains In boundless conflagration— Instruct her poor benighted sons, And save a sinking nation! Shall we not lift the lowly, Whom law and custom ban? O help us to exalt and praise God, in the mind of man! Art thou a Man? Then, haste to aid, Perchance, a sireless brother! And in his parent, worn with want, “O son! behold thy mother!” Friends of the chain'd in spirit! Set free our soul-bound slaves! And a redeemed and thankful world Shall smile upon your graves; Age after age shall see your deeds In useful beauty growing— Still gathering strength to save and bless— Like streams to ocean flowing. Ye too, whose aims are selfish, Who plough that ye may reap! Come hither! here for harvest sow, And give to get and keep! Bless and be bless'd, thou sordid son, And thou more sordid father! Plant gloom with light—and you and yours A thousandfold shall gather. Like sunbeams to the moorland, Or rest to weary woe, Or silence to the Sabbath hills, Your names will come and go! Your worth, like Ewden, lingering Around his hawthorn blossoms— Or Stanage beckoning to his clouds— Shall live in other bosoms. HYMN. [Lord! to the rose thy light and air] Lord! to the rose thy light and air Impart the glory which they share; To air's embrace her sweets she owes— With morn's warm kiss her beauty glows. Hark! how it floats the vale along! 'Tis music's voice! 'tis Nature's song! It charms the woods, the rocks, the skies; And, hark! how echo's soul replies! The lone flower hears the skylark sing, And trembles like his raptured wing; But pays the song that cheer'd and bless'd, With dewdrops, shed beside his nest. The wild bird bears the foodful seed To farthest wilds, where birds would feed; Lo! food springs up where hunger died, And beauty clothes the desert wide! Streams trade with clouds, seas trade with heav'n, Air trades with light, and is forgiv'n; While man would make all climes his own, But chain'd by man, laments alone. Where torrid climes intensely glow, Lo, trade buys gold with polar snow! Then let Bordeaux hire Glasgow's loom, And in our hearts Gaul's vintage bloom! Thy winds, O God! are free to blow; Thy streams are free to chime and flow; Thy clouds are free to roam the sky; Let man be free his arts to ply! The fiends would chain the winds and sea, Who famish men and libel Thee; Lord! give us hope! O banish fear! “From every face wipe every tear!” [The present, future, past] The present, future, past, What are they, Lord, but Thee? Thou art, and ever wast, What hath been and will be. Thou only seest the sun To which slow ages tend— And art the Unbegun, Which is, and cannot end. The generations gone, What are they but a word? All, all that all have done, Is but thy whisper, Lord. The deeds which, in old song, Like stars of morning shine, Are accents from thy tongue— Unwritten words of thine. Before Thee, Homer's name, Ere Greece was named, went forth; And, like a word of flame, Glared Alaric from the North. Methinks I hear thy voice, Prophetic, at this hour— Where evil powers rejoice, And worship evil power. A word of fatal tone, The blind shall hear and see; A word of fire unblown On them shall written be. Lo! things of earth combine, To curse the blessèd sod! Bid God his power resign! And clench their fists at God. And dreadful art Thou, Lord, Thy words are dreadful then, When men make law a sword, To smite the rights of men! The dust of patriots dead Hears then thy stillest tones; Pale tyrants, waxing red, Crouch frighted on their thrones; For wrongs go forth in might, Like whirlwind on the sea; When vengeance strikes for right, What is he, Lord, but Thee? [Wrong not the labouring poor by whom ye live!] Wrong not the labouring poor by whom ye live! Wrong not your humble fellow-worms, ye proud! For God will not the poor man's wrongs forgive, But hear his plea, and have his plea allowed. O be not like the vapours, splendour roll'd, That, sprung from earth's green breast, usurp the sky, Then spread around contagion black and cold, Till all who mourn the dead prepare to die! No! imitate the bounteous clouds, that rise, Freighted with bliss, from river, vale, and plain; The thankful clouds, that beautify the skies, Then fill the lap of earth with fruit and grain. Yes! emulate the mountain and the flood, That trade in blessings with the mighty deep; Till, sooth'd to peace, and satisfied with good, Man's heart be happy as a child asleep. [Lord! not for vengeance rave the wrong'd] Lord! not for vengeance rave the wrong'd, The withering hopes, the woes prolong'd! Our cause is just, our Judge divine; But judgment, God of all! is thine. We call not on thy foes the doom That scourged the proud of wretched Rome, Who stole, for few, the lands of all, To make all life a funeral. But not in vain thy millions call On thee, if thou art Lord of all; And, by thy works, and by thy word, Hark! millions cry for justice, Lord! THE UNWRITTEN WORD. Hast thou not spoken, God, When wrongs unchain the slave; And slaves make every sod A slave's or tyrant's grave? Dost Thou not speak to all, When names, made bright by thee, Blaze comet-like, and fall From heaven to obloquy? How like a trumpet's blast, By thee in whirlwind blown, Thy stern Napoleon past Through shrieks of states o'erthrown! What crush'd him, disarray'd, When perish'd man and steed? Thy outraged laws of trade! They crush'd him, like a weed! A voice of many sighs, Woe's still small voice of doom, Whisper'd!—and seas and skies Sang, “Lo, the Island-Tomb!” For hosts, of many tongues, That voice array'd in might; A universe of wrongs Arm'd wrongers for the right. But cursed by battles won, What learn'd they, triumph-taught? That victory, self-undone, Hath lost the fight unfought. Napoleon could not shake What pigmies have o'erthrown! O outraged England, wake! O Nature, claim thy own! When shall we hear again Thy still small whisper, God? O break the bondman's chain! Uncurse the tax-plough'd sod! If still thy name is love, Be Labour's sons thy care! And from thy earth remove The vermin all can spare. Deaf reptiles! they devour The honey and the tree, Root, branches, fruit, and flower; But not our trust in Thee! EPITAPH.

Greater than Colon, name renown'd In famed Discovery's rolls, Here lies Charles Dickens, who first found That poor folks may have souls. But Dickens will not thank us for doing him more than justice. Let it not be forgotten that he had in Bulwer a precursor worthy of him; nor let the class whom that precursor has so highly honoured in being one of them, fail to add four words to the question asked by one of his humble characters: “If little Paul should be scragged?” Who is to blame!

Colonel Thompson. COLONEL THOMPSON IN PALACE YARD. Who is that small Napoleon-featured pleader? The sage, whose metaphors are demonstrations; The bard, whose music yet shall teach all nations That ignorance is want, war, waste, and treason; Thompson, the Hadyn and Molière of reason. Clear-voiced as evening's throstle, o'er the booming Of conscious forests heard when storms are coming, He stills these thousands, like a people's leader. PELHAM. We spoke of Bulwer. “He was great In style and thought.” Could he create? “He could both execute and plan.” His book was making then a stir, And a still youth beside us sate. “What do you think of Bulwer, Sir?” And, placid-eyed, the youth replied, “He is a Gentleman.” INSCRIPTION. Here lies the man who stripp'd Sin bare, And kept her lean, on hard-earn'd fare; Who forced the poor at home to stay, But rode to church on Sabbath-day; And went to heav'n, the sinless say, Because he bother'd God with prayer, And would not let Him have his way. ANN. The broken heart, that loves in vain, Resigns the loved one never, But, in despair, still hopes to gain The lost for ever: Then, greet the shy morn's treacherous glow, Thou pale autumnal blossom, Ere chill November's sleet and snow Beat on thy bosom! So, Ann still loved: it was her doom To love, in shame and sorrow: Charles came no more! but “He will come,” She said, “to-morrow.” Oh, yet for her, deep bliss remain'd! She dream'd he came, and kiss'd her! And, in that hour, the angels gain'd Another sister. EPIGRAM. [Said Death to Pol Sly, “Put no rum in thy tea] Said Death to Pol Sly, “Put no rum in thy tea, Or die as thy mother died, aged twenty-three.” Pol gave him an answer that struck the churl dumb, “My mother, you know, put no tea in her rum.” WRITTEN WITH A PENCIL IN DARTFIELD CHURCHYARD.

STEAM IN THE DESERT. “God made all nations of one blood,” And bade the nation-wedding flood Bear good-for-good to men: Lo, interchange is happiness! The mindless are the riverless! The shipless have no pen! What deed sublime by them is wrought? What type have they of speech or thought, What soul-ennobled page? No record tells their tale of pain! Th' Unwritten History of Cain Is theirs, from age to age. Steam!—if the nations grow not old That see broad ocean's “back of gold,” Or hear him in the wind— Why dost not thou thy banner shake O'er sealess, streamless lands, and make One nation of mankind? If rivers are but seeking rest, Ev'n when they climb from ocean's breast To plant on earth the rose; If good for good is doubly bless'd; Oh, let the sever'd east and west In action find repose! Yes, let the wilderness rejoice, The voiceless champaign hear the voice Of millions long estranged; That waste, and want, and war may cease! And all men know, That Love and Peace Are—Good for Good Exchanged! GRACE BEFORE MEAT. We thank Thee, Lord, for this our food, By honest, useful efforts won: Requite us still with good for good! So let thy will on earth be done. GRACE AFTER MEAT. Lord, Thou hast given, oh, ever give The food by which thy children live! Blessings to them who blessings earn, Not ill for ill, wilt Thou return. EPITAPH ON A SKILFUL WORKMAN. No column's capital lies shatter'd here; Reader! a column's base demands thy tear. HE IS NOT HERE. I found him in his sleep unending, And could not shed a tear; I kiss'd his lips, long o'er him bending, And sobb'd, “He is not here.” Men bore him to the home of sleepers; I walk'd behind the bier; Around him many were the weepers; I sobb'd, “He is not here.” I sought the place where he was sleeping, When none but we were near; I knelt upon his grave-stone weeping, And sigh'd, “He is not here.” BEWARE OF DOGMAS. Two pilgrims, broiling in the sun, Did once to Glasgow come. Each had but twopence. James bought rum, With all his cash; and Charles a bun— Of his two pennies saving one. Charles died of fever in a week! James lives and thrives, is stout and sleek, And keeps, abjuring rum and gin, A Temperance inn. While Temperance is practised by all freetraders, Teetotal is preached by almost every advocate of the monopolists. To the latter, anything but the right thing is the one thing needful. Their legislation prohibits hope; and as a rule, scarcely admitting an exception, it may be said that drunkenness is despair. I never met with a teetotalist who could fathom the profundity of their stock argument, “That strong liquors would not be drunk if nobody drank them;” nor with one who could give a good reason why alcohol should not be sold without license, as other poisons are. Few persons take aquafortis in excess; I am a waterdrinker because I find that alcohol is injurious to me; but I am not an interdicter of alcohol to those whom it blesses; and they are many! Even to me, after much toil, a chrystal of it, melted in a calm cup of rest, is a great blessing. WHO HATH A DEVIL? Wrongs, in themselves, are feeble weeds, And yet how fast they grow! For slaves make tyrants, and the seeds Of all that tyrants sow. Weeds, tyrants know, wherever sown, Will clothe in weeds the sod: Therefore they say, “Man, mind thy own, And leave the rest to God.” But God hath will'd that wretched man Shall work while it is day, And help his brethren, if he can, Along their painful way; Nor fail to plant, as on he goes From humble door to door, Soul-featured Beauty's pink or rose, To bless and raise the poor. LET ME REST. He does well who does his best: Is he weary? let him rest: Brothers! I have done my best, I am weary—let me rest. After toiling oft in vain, Baffled, yet to struggle fain; After toiling long, to gain Little good with mickle pain; Let me rest—But lay me low, Where the hedgeside roses blow; Where the little daisies grow, When the winds a-maying go; Where the footpath rustics plod; Where the breeze-bow'd poplars nod; Where the old woods worship God; Where His pencil paints the sod; Where the wedded throstle sings; Where the young bird tries his wings; Where the wailing plover swings Near the runlet's rushy springs! Where, at times, the tempest's roar, Shaking distant sea and shore, Still will rave old Barnesdale o'er; To be heard by me no more! There, beneath the breezy west, Tired and thankful, let me rest, Like a child, that sleepeth best On its gentle mother's breast. BRITISH RURAL COTTAGES IN 1842. The scentless rose, train'd by the poor, May sometimes grace the peasant's door; But when will comfort enter there? Beauty without, hides death within, Like flowers upon the shroud of sin: For ev'n the poor man's marriage-joys, His wife, his sad-lipp'd girls and boys, In mercy or in mockery given, But brighten, with their “hour of heav'n,” A life of ghastly toil and care: His pay is pain, his hope despair, Although the cottage-rose is fair! Out of his weekly pittance small, Three crowns, for children, wife, and all, Poor British Slave! how can he save A pittance for his evening's close? No roses deck the workhouse-grave! Where is the aged pauper's rose! EPIGRAM.

I met a sage who had been dead A hundred years and more; And still he said what he had said A hundred years before: Then, met I one (a rogue's sly son,) Who printed what the other said, And praised it, ev'n with tears: Alas! he also had been dead A hundred years. EPIGRAM.

R. Pemberton. Poor Charles! POOR CHARLES. Shunn'd by the rich, the vain, the dull, Truth's all-forgiving son, The gentlest of the beautiful, His painful course hath run; Content to live, to die resign'd, In meekness proud of wishes kind, And duties nobly done. A godlike child hath left the earth; In heav'n a child is born: Cold World! thou could'st not know his worth, And well he earn'd thy scorn; For he believed that all may be What martyrs are, in spite of thee, Nor wear thy crown of thorn. Smiling, he bound it round his brain, And dared what martyrs dare; For God, who wastes nor joy nor pain, Had arm'd his soul to bear; But vain his hope to find below That peace which heav'n alone can know; He died—to seek it there. ON A ROSE IN DECEMBER. Stay yet, pale flower, though coming storms will tear thee, My soul grows darker, and I cannot spare thee. WAR. The victories of mind, Are won for all mankind; But war wastes what it wins, Ends worse than it begins, And is a game of woes, Which nations always lose: Though tyrant tyrant kill, The slayer liveth still. SONNET ON A PAIR OF SPECTACLES. How many men, who liv'd to bless mankind, Have died unthank'd! Far-teaching and self-taught, They did what learning scorns to learn or teach; Their deeds are portion of the general thought; Their thoughts have pass'd into the common speech, And labour's wages; yet they left behind Nor name, nor record! save the good which grew Out of the sacrifice that gives and saves. Lo, what a tree is rising from their graves, To shelter, ev'n on earth, the wise and true! Then, worship not famed words, which, like the winds, Or Homer's song, seem things that cannot die, And ever lived: they are but names of minds Whose good or evil speaks immortally. TO FANNY ANN. As the flower bloweth, As the stream floweth, Daughter of beauty, Do thou thy duty. What, though the morrow May dawn in sorrow? Ev'n as light hasteth, Darkness, too, wasteth: Morn then discloses, Raindrops on roses! Daughter of beauty, What, then, is duty? Time says, “Death knoweth!” Death says, “Time showeth!” LAW. Lawgiver, if thy aim is good, Make thy laws known, and understood. I know a young lady who, when four years of age, could not learn her letters. Often chided, and at last severely, she burst into tears. Her mother wept too, and without suspecting the cause of the evil, wrote an alphabet in large letters, which the child mastered in a week. But when she returned to school, she still could not learn. It was then discovered that she was born short-sighted; and it is affecting now to hear her say, that whenever she had been chided, she believed she was in fault. How many victims of our conservators of ignorance have gone to the scaffold with a similar perplexing conviction on their minds, and hearing, even in death, the death-chaplain (ignorantly, but not therefore innocently,) advocate the murderous cause! MONODY ON JOHN KEATS. He lived and loved! He was a power That left its thought more felt than spoken: “A fading flower! a falling shower! A breaking wave!” which now is broken. See Shelley's Adonais. Can greatness die, and be unborn? It cannot, thou in scorn repliest: He perish'd in his “scorn of scorn,” And lowest deem'd, of all was highest. A vapour quench'd his visions grand: Ah, hope destroy'd is worth's undoing! He left the deathless deed he plann'd A deed undone—And what a ruin! Hyperion, A Fragment. TO A LADY, WHO COMPLAINED THAT SHE COULD NOT DECYPHER MY SIGNATURE, AND THAT I HAD ADDRESSED HER AS A “CEMENT MANUFACTURER,” WHEREAS SHE WAS MOVING IN THE FIRST CIRCLES OF SOCIETY. I'm sorry that my ill-scrawl'd name Defeated my intent; And that I styled so grand a dame, “A maker of cement.” Forgive me, Madam! I confess, A grievous fault was mine: I own'd your claim to usefulness, But knew not you were fine. TO WED, OR NOT TO WED. THOMAS. I'm tired of single life; I'll live alone no more; I'll wed a loved and loving wife; My sire did so before: How brightly, then, my fire will blaze! How sweetly Ann will sing! We shall be merry all our days, As skylarks on the wing. WILLIAM. Bless'd is the mated bird; And where she, brooding, cowers, Melodies of the heart are heard, Amid the hawthorn-flowers. Though richest wines, their sweetness fled, Grow dull, and acrid too; I say not, “Thomas, do not wed!” For God says, “Thomas, do!” NOT FOR NOUGHT. Do and suffer nought in vain: Let no trifle trifling be: If the salt of life is pain, Let ev'n wrongs bring good to thee; Good to others, few or many; Good to all, or good to any. If men curse thee, plant their lies Where, for truth, they best may grow; Let the railers make thee wise, Preaching peace, where'er thou go: God no useless plant hath planted, Evil (wisely used) is wanted. If the nation-feeding corn Thriveth under icèd snow; If the small bird, on the thorn, Useth well its guarded sloe; Bid thy cares thy comforts double; Gather fruit from thorns of trouble. See the Rivers! how they run Strong in gloom, and strong in light! Like the never-wearied sun, Through the day, and through the night, Each along his path of duty, Turning coldness into beauty! THOMAS HOBBES IN 1651. The labour that but stirs the earth Imparts to worthless matter worth. ADAM SMITH 1766. Wealth is not only coin or gold, But beef, cloth, brandy, rye; And all that can be bought or sold Is property. TURGOT IN 1774. The right to buy is the right to sell, And the right to get and save: Free commerce is a consequence Of the right to earn and have. SONG. [They say I'm old, because I'm grey] They say I'm old, because I'm grey, The agèd bard, they now call me! But grey or green, I boldly say, We're not old yet, but mean to be. Though sixty years and ten may doom Tired men to rest with worms and me; With sixty gone, and ten to come, We're not old yet, but mean to be. My eyes flash flame, my heart is glad, When poor men shake their sides with glee; And though they cry, “Come on, Old Lad!” We're not old yet, but mean to be. While soars the skylark high and higher, And bids the mountains wake, to see, How morn can fill my veins with fire, We're not old yet, but mean to be. Thou brightening cloud, that sail'st afar Where screams the falcon, wheeling free! Tell yonder fading, winking star, We're not old yet, but mean to be. OH, TELL US! Companion'd each by all and none, A mob of souls, yet each alone, We journey to the dread Unknown. In nothing found, in all things shown, In all life living, yet alone, Where may it be, that dread Unknown? Oh, who, or what, so dreadly shown, And world-attended, yet alone, Is that all-sought, all-known Unknown? RELIGION. What is Religion? “Speak the truth in love.” Reject no good. Mend, if thou canst, thy lot. Doubting, enquire,—nor dictate till thou prove. Enjoy thy own—exceed not, trespass not. Pity the scorners of life's meanest thing. If wrong'd, forgive—that Hate may lose his sting. Think, speak, work, get—bestow, or wisely keep. So live, that thou may'st smile, and no one weep. Be bless'd—like birds, that sing because they love; And bless—like rivers, singing to the sun, Giving and taking blessings, as they run; Or soft-voiced showers, that cool the answering grove, When cloudy wings are wide in heav'n display'd, And blessings brighten o'er the freshen'd sod, Till earth is like the countenance of God. This is Religion! saith the bard of trade. SONNET.

Hymners of fraud and slaughter, By cant call'd other names, alone find buyers— Who buy, but read not. “What a loss in paper,” Groans each immortal of the host of sighers! “What profanation of the midnight taper In expirations vile!

By life's strange offs and ons! Glory hath had great dealings with the Johns, Since history first awaked where fable snored. John Cade, John Huss, John Hampden, and John Knox! Ay, these were names of fellows who had will. John Wilson's name, far sounded, sounds not ill; But how unlike John Milton's, or John Locke's! John Bright, like Locke and Milton, scorns paid sloth; And Johnson might have liked to gibbet both. SONNET.

At shrines whose mysteries have gods of wood, The age-long pilgrimage brings crowds to pray; But in a month, a fortnight, or a day, Dead drops th' immortal who is understood!

On, sky-fed Wanderer, go! Waste not at monkish Burton this bright hour; Pass Darfield's meads, and many a blossom'd bower; Bid Wath good night! and sleep at Conisbro', In Don's cold arms. Here, scarcely heard to lisp, Thy waters bask in evening's purply gold, And round thy lilies — fresh, blush-tinged, and crisp— Linger, as loth to leave this loveliest scene— Bard of the Rustic Wreath! my tale is told; I stand again, where thou hast often been. ON THE CORONATION OF VICTORIA THE FIRST. WRITTEN FOR THE PRINTERS OF SHEFFIELD. What! here again, Old Caxton? Thou'rt welcome, as before: Calm emblem of long-slumbering strength, That, like a giant, waked, at length, To sleep no more! Evil lives long, Old Caxton! Long, too, live sky and sea; And Truth's worst foes as well might try To tame and fetter sea and sky, As conquer thee. Yet since we last beheld thee, Five years of shame have past; And still the toil-worn millions groan, And traitors still call ours their own, And grasp it fast. This is not well, Old Caxton! Yet still in truth we trust; If rocks are worn by sea and sky, The Press may Freedom's foes defy; They are but dust. Thou noblest apparition That mortal eye hath seen, Since Power went down to Death's dark shore! Could fitter symbol stand before A British Queen? FAREWELL TO RIVILIN. WRITTEN FOR MUSIC, AT THE REQUEST OF A. WOOD, ESQ. Beautiful River! goldenly shining, Where with the cistus woodbines are twining; (Birklands around thee, mountains above thee,) Rivilin wildest! do I not love thee? Why do I love thee, Heart-breaking River? Love thee, and leave thee? Leave thee for ever! Never to see thee, where the storms greet thee! Never to hear thee, rushing to meet me! Never to hail thee, joyfully chiming Beauty in music, Sister of Wiming! Playfully mingling laughter and sadness, Ribbledin's Sister! sad in thy gladness. Why must I leave thee, mournfully sighing Man is a shadow? River undying! Dream-like he passeth, cloud-like he wasteth, E'en as a shadow over thee hasteth. Oh, when thy poet, weary, reposes, Coffin'd in slander, far from thy roses, Tell all thy pilgrims, Heart-breaking River! Tell them I loved thee—love thee for ever! Yes, for the spirit blooms ever vernal; River of Beauty! love is eternal: While the rock reeleth, storm-struck and riven, Safe is the fountain flowing from heav'n. There wilt thou hail me, joyfully chiming Beauty in music, Sister of Wiming! Homed with the angels, hasten to greet me, Glad as the heathflower, glowing to meet thee. THE DEAD ARE LIVING. Ask not the unreplying tomb, “Where are the dead?” But ask the hawthorn-bloom, Returning still To vale and hill; The verdure, spread Wide as the seas; The flowers, the trees, The river's song; The gain that laughs, the loss that weeps The strong deed of the strong, That ever works, and never sleeps. Or ask the ever-taking, ever-giving, Deep ocean, and blue sky; And they will tell thee, that the dead are living, And cannot die. A COWARD'S BLOW. The strong man smote his wife; No help for her was nigh; No strength had she, to fight for life: She died, and he must die!

Though worthy are Thy deeds, when thou art true, Things worthier still, and holier far, Our sister yet will do; For this the worth of woman shows, On every peopled shore, That still as man in wisdom grows, He honours her the more. Oh, not for wealth, or fame, or power, Hath man's meek angel striven, But, silent as the growing flower, To make of earth a heav'n! And in her garden of the sun Heaven's brightest rose shall bloom; For woman's best is unbegun! Her advent yet to come! Educated woman, through her self-denying, self-aggrandising refusal to marry, without first securing a certain standard of comfort, is destined to save mankind, and in the language of St. Paul, “Lift us up!” LENT AND LOST. Of Mary, by heav'n lent, Heav'n has bereft us; And from her home all comfort went, When Mary left us. We fear no ills, no foes, Though they surround us; Pass on, thou cloud of many woes! The worst has found us. If lowest cannot fall, Need we be wary? We lost fear, joy, hope, danger, all, When we lost Mary. In vain, vex'd Sea of Change, Thou thy rocks chafest! Secure, thy dreaded verge we range: Saddest is safest. LAND. He ties up hands Who locks up lands: The lands which can't be sold and bought Bring men and states to worse than nought: The lands which can be freely sold Are worth a world of barren gold. Land, in Britain, is withdrawn from competition by the law of primogeniture, and in France by that of equal division among all the children of a marriage, to the great danger of both countries. EPIGRAM. [What is a communist? One who hath yearnings] What is a communist? One who hath yearnings For equal division of unequal earnings: Idler, or bungler, or both, he is willing To fork out his penny, and pocket your shilling. And he has two names, Legion and Danger. THE PEOPLE'S ANTHEM. WRITTEN FOR MUSIC, AT THE REQUEST OF W. T. WOOD, ESQ. When wilt thou save the people? Oh, God of mercy! when? Not kings and lords, but nations! Not thrones and crowns, but men! Flowers of thy heart, oh, God, are they! Let them not pass, like weeds, away! Their heritage a sunless day! God, save the people! Shall crime bring crime for ever, Strength aiding still the strong? Is it thy will, oh, Father, That man shall toil for wrong? “No!” say thy mountains; “No!” thy skies: “Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise, And songs be heard, instead of sighs.” God, save the people! When wilt thou save the people? Oh, God of Mercy! when? The people, Lord, the people! Not thrones and crowns, but men! God! save the people! thine they are, Thy children, as thy angels fair: Save them from bondage, and despair! God! save the people! And who are the people? They are all those persons who, by honestly maintaining themselves, and, perhaps earning a surplus,— or by honestly living on the precious earnings and savings of others —prove their right to govern the community through their representatives. I deny that any human being is born possessed of a right to vote for members of parliament. All men, and all women, are born possessed of the right to acquire the power of doing so; just as all boys are born possessed of the right to acquire the power of using edgetools. But no boy is born possessed of a right to cut even his own fingers; and before any person meddle with mine I would have him understand the nature of edgetools. The right to vote for members of parliament is founded on property and knowledge, that property and knowledge which every self-sustained person possesses, in the labour, or skill, which enables him, or her, to live; and taxation and representation ought to be co-extensive, because Taxes are paid by self-sustained persons alone. LOVE STRONG IN DEATH. We watch'd him, while the moonlight, Beneath the shadow'd hill, Seem'd dreaming of good angels, And all the woods were still. The brother of two sisters Drew painfully his breath: A strange fear had come o'er him, For love was strong in death. The fire of fatal fever Burn'd darkly on his cheek, And often to his mother He spoke, or tried to speak: “I felt, as if from slumber I never could awake: Oh, Mother, give me something To cherish for your sake! A cold, dead weight is on me, A heavy weight, like lead: My hands and feet seem sinking Quite through my little bed: I am so tired, so weary— With weariness I ache: Oh, Mother, give me something To cherish for your sake! Some little token give me, Which I may kiss in sleep— To make me feel I'm near you, And bless you, though I weep. My sisters say I'm better— But, then, their heads they shake: Oh, Mother, give me something To cherish for your sake! Why can't I see the poplar, The moonlit stream and hill, Where, Fanny says, good angels Dream, when the woods are still? Why can't I see you, Mother? I surely am awake: Oh, haste! and give me something To cherish for your sake!” His little bosom heaves not; The fire hath left his cheek: The fine chord—is it broken? The strong chord—could it break? Ah, yes! the loving spirit Hath wing'd his flight away: A mother and two sisters Look down on lifeless clay. TO THOMAS LISTER. Friend, I return your English Hexameters, thanking you for them. More than forty years since, I constructed such verses, Choosing a lofty theme, too often worded unsimply. Even now, I remember one stol'n line of the anthem: “Thou for ever and ever, God, Omnipotent, reignest!” Though my verbiage pleased me, long ago did it journey Whither dead things tend. For Homer's world-famous metre Cannot in English be pleasing. Saxon may write it in Saxon, Oft for dactyl and spondee using iambic and trochee, Pleased—and making a boast of his wasted labour and lost time; But with grace and simplicity none can write it in our tongue, Though the sturdy gothic oft runs into it promptly, As it grandly does in these fine lines from the Bible: “How art thou fall'n from heav'n, oh, Lucifer, son of the Morn!” and “Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?” Not unpleasing always, mostly 'tis feeble, yet stilted, Wanting, in wanting ease, the might which is mightiest, beauty. Yet can it finely paint the beauty of form and of colour; Skies, and the sea; or mountains cloud-like in distance, and stealing Azure from heav'n; or the daisy fresh in the dewgleam of dawn; or Young June's blush-tinted hawthorn, that scatters the snow of its dropp'd flowers Over the faded cowslip, and roses embraced by the woodbine, Under the mute, or songful, or thunder-whispering forest; But from man's heart seldom it brings the tear, which the angels, Knowing not sorrow, might almost in their blessedness envy. Slow or rapid, sweet or solemn, in Greek and in Latin, It is in English undignified, loose, and worse than the worst prose. One advantage it has—it must be utter'd as prose is; And as it may be wanted, if only as changes are wanted, I subjoin the rule for its fitting or modern construction: Every line must consist of six feet, dactyls and spondees, Dactyls and trochees, or dactyls and both: A dactyl the fifth foot Must be; a spondee or trochee the sixth: Each line must contain not More than sixteen syllables, and not fewer than thirteen. BULLY IDLE'S PRAYER. Lord, send us weeks of Sundays, A saint's day every day, Shirts gratis, ditto breeches, No work, and double pay! Tell Short and Long they're both short now; To Slow and Fast one meed allow; Let Louis Blanc take Ashley's cow, And Richmond give him hay! Twenty-four years ago our Protectionists had notice given them, by me, that they would have imitators; and they must not be allowed to forget, that out of their cornlaws sprung the Trade's Union which is now (March 1848) the French government! HYMN. [Still for rest on Sabbath day] Still for rest on Sabbath day, Air and light on “Labour's day,” Let us toil—if toil we may; Toil till death, if toil we may, Toil till death for pauper's pay, And our blessèd Sabbath day. WILL IT RAIN? “Bread!” the starver faintly sigheth; “I have none!” the robb'd replieth; Doall loseth, Starveall winneth; Cheatall laugheth, while he sinneth; Work grim-gaspeth o'er spare diet; And the Million-Tongued is quiet. When the forest breatheth deeply, Darkèd sun down shining steeply; When the noon-night scarcely shifteth; And the windy cloud uplifteth Not a leaf the mute heav'ns under; Then, the thoughtful look for thunder! GOOD MEN'S GRAVES. Lone, they rest. Nor Snap, nor Snivel, Robs, or pities virtue's dust! Marble insults, Cant and Drivel Build not o'er the just. Them, in thought, the honest only Visit, while they toil as slaves: Oh, 'Tis true! the stars shine lonely Over good men's graves. All in silence, not in sorrow, Read they on the wordless sod, “These men's deeds will speak, to-morrow; They are words of God; Heard in heav'n, with tears of gladness; Mute on earth! yet working there; Bringing chains for rapine's madness, Wings for chain'd despair.” YOUNG POET'S PLAINT. God, release our dying sister! Beauteous blight hath sadly kiss'd her: Whiter than the wild, white roses, Famine in her face discloses Mute submission, patience holy, Passing fair! but passing slowly. Though she said, “You know I'm dying,” In her heart green trees are sighing; Not of them hath pain bereft her, In the city, where we left her: “Bring,” she said, “a hedgeside blossom!” Love shall lay it on her bosom. ARTISAN'S OUTDOOR HYMN. Again, oh, Lord, we humbly pray That Thou wilt guide our steps aright: Bless here, this day, tired Labour's day! Oh, fill our souls with love and light! For failing food, six days in seven, We till the black town's dust and gloom: But here we drink the breath of heav'n, And here to pray the poor have room. The stately temple, built with hands, Throws wide its doors to pomp and pride; But in the porch their beadle stands, And thrusts the child of toil aside. Therefore we seek the daisied plain, Or climb thy hills, to touch thy feet; Here, far from splendour's city-fane, Thy weary sons and daughters meet. Is it a crime to tell Thee here, That here the sorely-tried are met? To seek thy face, and find Thee near? And on thy rock our feet to set? Where, wheeling wide, the plover flies; Where sings the woodlark on the tree; Beneath the music of thy skies, Is it a crime to worship Thee? “We waited long, and sought Thee, Lord,” Content to toil, but not to pine; And with the weapons of thy Word Alone, assail'd our foes and thine. Thy truth and Thee, we bade them fear; They spurn thy truth, and mock our moan! “Thy counsels, Lord, they will not hear, And Thou hast left them to their own.” THE POOR MAN'S DAY. Grahame. Sabbath holy! To the lowly Still art thou a welcome day. When thou comest, earth and ocean, Shade and brightness, rest and motion, Help the poor man's heart to pray. Sun-waked forest! Bird, that soarest O'er the mute, empurpled moor! Throstle's song, that stream-like flowest! Wind, that over dewdrop goest! Welcome now the woe-worn poor. Little river, Young for ever! Cloud, gold-bright with thankful glee! Happy woodbine, gladly weeping! Gnat, within the wild rose keeping! Oh, that they were bless'd as ye! Sabbath holy! For the lowly Paint with flowers thy glittering sod; For affliction's sons and daughters, Bid thy mountains, woods, and waters, Pray to God, the poor man's God! From the fever, (Idle never Where on Hope Want bars the door,) From the gloom of airless alleys, Lead thou to green hills and valleys Weary Lordland's trampled poor! Pale young mother! Gasping brother! Sister, toiling in despair! Grief-bow'd sire, that life-long diest! White-lipp'd child, that sleeping sighest! Come, and drink the light and air. Still God liveth; Still he giveth What no law can take away; And, oh, Sabbath! bringing gladness Unto hearts of weary sadness, Still art thou “The Poor Man's Day!” HYMN. [To live in vain! to live in pain!] To live in vain! to live in pain! To toil in hopeless sadness! Is this the doom of godlike man, Oh, God of Love and Gladness? Not so the rose in summer blows, Not so the moon her changes knows, Not so the storm his madness. From storms that rock the oak to sleep, Thy woods their beauty borrow; And flowers, to-day, unheeded weep, Whose seeds will live to-morrow: So man, by painful ages taught, Will build, at last, on truthful thought, And wisdom, won from sorrow. Else, what a lie were written wide, By thy right hand, my Father, O'er all thy seas, in crimson dyed When Morning is a bather; O'er all thy vales of growing gold; Or where, on mountains black with cold, Thy clouds to battle gather. PRAYER. Bless'd be thy name, Eternal One! Thy kingdom come! thy will be done! Give us, this day, our daily food; Requite us, Lord, with good for good! Aid us temptation to repel; And from all evil guard us well: For thine the kingdom still will be, All glory, and all sov'reignty. THE IMITATED LANE. Now, Landscape-Maker, that with living trees Createst Painting! thou should'st hither come, And here learn how the town-sick heart to please. Can'st thou not, in thy tiny wild, find room For a wild lane, that with capricious ease Shading or brightening self-taught branch or flower, Will saunter gently to a seated bower? Or lead thee through a cloudlet of green gloom, Cheer'd by the music of its hidden rills, To sudden sunburst? where the hunter's cot Looks down on rivers, and the distant hills Climb to the firmament, yet marry not Their purple to the orange-blaze, that fills O'er-arching heav'n with pomp, And peace, and power! ODE ON THE MARRIAGE OF VICTORIA THE FIRST. Queen of our Hearts! true marriage Is made of solid bread; Not so, that Many-Childed Plague Which curseth board and bed: The ghastly league of woe with crime, To which starved men are driven, Though marriage call'd by law-made saints, Hath other names in heav'n. Lady! may all the blessings Which thou would'st give to all Who call thee queen, or God their lord, On thee, thrice blessèd, fall! If 'tis thy wish that every pair Should live in love for ever, May God return thee good for good, And love desert thee never! But want and crime, Victoria, Law-wedded in this land, Are curses, million-multiplied, That frown on every hand; And thou wilt wake, with him thou lov'st, From brief and troubled slumbers, If law of thine deal lessening loaves To famine's doubling numbers. Beautiful as the cistus, That o'er the stonechat's nest Stoops, when the moorland clouds lie down On evening's lap to rest, Art thou, my Queen! the morning dews Upon the orchard blossom, Are not more pure than is the heart Within thy royal bosom. But can the Queen be happy, If millions round her weep? In love's elysium, while hope faints, Can Hope's Victoria sleep? No. Bringer of Redemption! thou, In love's elysium sleeping, Would'st wake, to grieve with starving men, And worth in dungeons weeping. The woodbine's cluster'd beauty, That hides the brooding thrush, And weds the wild hedgerose, when Morn Shakes pearls from tree and bush, All trembling like the skylark's wing, Would dread his voice of gladness, And hate the marriages of Spring, If dower'd with hate and sadness. THE SUN'S BIRD. The cloud of the rain is beneath thee. Thou singest, Palaced in glory; but Morn hath begun A dark day for man, while the sunbeams thou wingest, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! They hear thee, but see thee not—sleepy bees hear thee, While under sad boughs the sad rivulets run; But thou art all music! care cannot get near thee, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! And when from Light's fields thou descendest, and over Thy nest the wide gloom spreads its canopy dun, How sweet will thy sleep be among the sweet clover, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! And, there, a white network of dewdrops the fairies, To chain leaf and flower, in a frolic have spun; While nigh thy dear home the tipp'd ear of the hare is, Bird of the Sun! Bird of the Sun! SCOTSMEN TO SCOTLAND, WRITTEN FOR THE SCOTSMEN OF SHEFFIELD. Thy Men of Men shall we forget, Old Scotland? No. Where'er we be, All lonely, or in exile met, We think of them and thee. Mother of Knox! “hast thou a charm” That gives to all thy name who bear Thoughts which unnerve the despot's arm, And Will, to do and dare? Thou bad'st him build on tyrant's bones An altar to the Lord of Lords; Thou gav'st him power to shatter thrones, And vanquish kings, with words. Stern Mother of the deathless dead! Where stands a Scot, a freeman stands, Self-stay'd, if poor—self-clothed, self-fed, Mind-mighty, in all lands. No mitred pleader need thy sons, To save the wretch whom Mercy spurns; No classic lore thy little ones, Who find a Bard in Burns. Their path, though dark, they will not miss; Secure, they tread on danger's brink; They say, “This shall be!” and it is; For, ere they act, they think. Mother of Burns! thy woe-nursed bard Not always wisely thought or said; He err'd, he sinn'd—but, oh, 'tis hard To ban the voiceless dead! Mother! thy doric speech hath power The heart with passion's thrill to move; But none could sing, in hall or bower, Like him, thy Bard of Love. Who dipp'd his words in lightning? Who With thunder arm'd his stormy rhyme? Who made his music tender, true, Terse, terrible, sublime? Who bade thy bard, in thrall, maintain A freeman's port, where'er he trod? Who taught the peasant to disdain Proud Fashion's Minstrels? God. Who gave the child of toil a lyre, With living sunbeams wildly strung? And taught his soul of living fire Truth's universal tongue? God. See Coleridge's Hymn to Sunrise. But with torture Faction fill'd The cup he drain'd in gloomy pride: What marvel, if the poison kill'd? What marvel, if he died? Few were his days, his fortunes foul; Bravely he struggled, though not long; And with a poet's glowing soul, Drew near to God in song. For Conscience to thy poet said, “Burns! be a martyr!” “For the truth, I will,” he cried—and bow'd his head, And died, grey-hair'd in youth. With little men he might not stay, But hasted from a world unkind: Oh, guess the worth he threw away, By what he left behind! And what a wreath his fame had worn, Amid a world's immortal tears, Had he, like England's Milton, borne The fruit of sixty years! But shall it of our sires be told That they their “brother poor” forsook? No! for they gave him more than gold; They bought the brave man's Book! Scotland! thy sons—and not unearn'd This day of pleasing tears returns— Are met to mourn thy trampled, spurn'd, Poor, broken-hearted Burns. And oft again, the kind, the brave, Who sorrow's feast, like him, have shared, Will meet, to honour in his grave Thy glorious rustic bard. Oh, spare his frailties!—write them not On mute Misfortune's coffin-lid!— Ev'n Bacon err'd, and greater Scott Not always greatly did. A fearful gift is flame from heav'n, To him who bears it in his breast: Self-fired, and blasted, but forgiv'n, Let Robert's ashes rest. ERIN, A DIRGE, FOR APRIL, 1847. Oh, for snow, strange April snow, Cold and cheap! a shroud of woe For pale dead Erin's nakedness! Snow-clad Broom, oh, drooping broom, Hearse of snow, of plumes a plume, Weep over Erin coffinless! There are colder things than snow, Sadder things than death and woe, Proud Rapine's cold hard-heartedness! And that saddest, helpless pain Which, when struck, strikes not again! Now wordless, lifeless, coffinless. Insect, that would'st God enthrall! Earning nought and taking all! Art thou thy country's nothingness? Man! whom that vile insect's will Yet may torture, starve, and kill! Remember Erin coffinless. How men treat subjected man, When they may do what they can, Well knows scourged India's wofulness; Well, Bengal, thy famish'd dead (Victim-myriads o'er thee spread!) Forespoke of Erin coffinless. Oh, thou snow-clad forest-bough! In thy sun-lit glory now, Laugh not at death's wide wastefulness; But lament, while brightly glows April's noon o'er Winter snows, A nation dead and coffinless! And—oh! pale unshrouded one, Cover'd by the heav'ns alone! A white sheet now shall cover thee: Help is vain, but help is nigh; And thy friend, the pitying sky Shall throw a cold sheet over thee. RHYMED RAMBLES. IN THREE PARTS. Part First. TO G. C. HOLLAND, M.D. Holland! thou lov'st the little songful lyre, On which, well-pleased thy bidding to obey, For the first time, I now attempt to play, Fretting, with skill-less touch, the sonnet's wire. Alas! the strings of this small harp require, To bring forth half their worth, a master's hand! Yet, as I wander through a lovely land, And stop, at times, its marvels to admire, May I not sing them too? Yea, while the breeze, Sighing o'er moated grange, or castle bold, Awakes the music of their ancient trees, The lyre, beloved of bards whose fires re-cold, That sweetest lyre I'll place before my knees, And make my theme the wonders I behold. POWERS OF THE SONNET. Why should the tiny harp be chain'd to themes In fourteen lines with pedant rigour bound? The sonnet's might is mighter than it seems: Witness the bard of Eden lost and found, Who gave this lute a clarion's battle sound. And, lo! another Milton calmly turns His eyes within on light that ever burns, Waiting till Wordsworth's second peer be found! Meantime, Fitzadam's mournful music shows That the scorn'd sonnet's charm may yet endear Some long deep strain, or lay of well-told woes; Such as, in Byron's couplet, brings a tear To manly cheeks, or o'er his stanza throws Rapture and grief, solemnity and fear. EUGENE ARAM. Knaresbro'! thou wilt be famous through all time, Because poor Aram's history imparts A dreadful unsolv'd riddle to all hearts— A half-told secret, in its gloom sublime, Though trite and common are death, want, and crime! But Bulwer, o'er thy caverns, rocks, and trees, Throws the deep charm of thoughtful melodies, Heart cherish'd, like a dim cathedral's chime. That charm will live when rock-built towers decay— That charm, when rocks themselves are turn'd to dust, Will to the slanderers of the great and just, And the grim ghost of buried envy, say— “Though Time hath plough'd your graves and ground thy bust, I am not of the things which pass away.” PLUMPTON. Who would not here become a hermit? here Grow old in song? here die, on Nature's breast, Hush'd, like yon wild bird on the lake, to rest? Then laid asleep beneath the branches sere, Till the Awakener in the east appear, And call the dead to judgment? Quietness, Methinks the heart-whole rustic loves thee less Than the town's thought-worn smiler. Oh! most dear Art thou to him who flies from care to bowers That breathe of sainted calmness! and, to me, More welcome than the breath of hawthorn flowers To children of the city, when delight Leads them from smoke to cowslips, is the sight Of these green shades, those rocks, this little sea. BOLTON ABBEY. Spirits of wonder, loveliness, and fear, Dwell in these groves, beneath o'er-arching trees, With the dim presence of their mysteries Haunting the rocks and mountain shadows near: They pass the lone enthusiast, wandering here, By strangled Wharfe, or Barden's ancient tower; Pass him, nor shake a dew-drop from a flower, But with their whispers soothe his soul-taught ear, As with a dream of prayer; until he starts, Awaken'd from deep thoughts of Time's calm might And Nature's beauty, and in awe departs;— When, to the Abbey's moonlight-tinted walls, The demon of the spectred river calls, Mock'd by the voices of mysterious night. THE VICARAGE. The Vicar's house is smother'd in its roses, His garden glows with dahlias large and new; “Bees murmur in his limes the summer through;” And on the seat beneath them often dozes A better man than Calumny supposes. His living is three hundred pounds a-year; “But not of servants, wife, and children clear.” He gives away his common right and closes, And keeps no horse. When winter strips the tree, To poor men's homes his wife and daughters go, With needful gifts of flannel, food, or fire, And made-wines for the sick. Now, would not he, Who deem'd the labourer worth of his hire, Have paid it to his faithful servant?—No. POET v. PARSON. A hireling's wages to the priest are paid; While lives and dies, in want and rags, the bard! But preaching ought to be its own reward, And not a sordid, if an honest trade. Paul, labouring proudly with his hands, array'd Regenerated hearts in peace and love; And when, with power, they preach'd the mystic dove, Penn, Barclay, Clarkson, ask'd not Mammon's aid. As, for its own sake, poetry is sweet To poets—so, on tasks of mercy bound, Religion travels with unsandaled feet, Making the flinty desert holy ground; And never will her triumph be complete While one paid pilgrim upon earth is found. BRIMHAM ROCKS. Rocks! sacred deem'd to eldest fraud, when fear First darken'd death's reality with dreams! The spirit of your cruel worship seems, Like a wolf's shadow, yet to linger here, Deepening the gloom with peril still too near; For guile and knowledge long have been allies, Most pious found when preaching blasphemies, Most treacherous when most trusted. But the year, Whose seasons are all winters, soon must close; Knowledge hath join'd the millions; and mankind Are learning to distinguish friends from foes; The eagle-eyed give sight unto the blind; The eagle-wing'd are chasing crime-made woes; The mighty-voiced are heard in every wind. TREES AT BRIMHAM. Gnarl'd oak and holly! stone-cropp'd like the stone! Are ye of it, or is it part of you? Your union strange is marvellously true, And makes the granite, which I stand upon, Seem like the vision of an empire gone— Gone, yet still present, thou it never was, Save as a shadow—let the shadow pass! So perish human glories, every one! But Rocks! ye are not shadows; Trees! ye cast Th' Almighty's shadow o'er the homeward bee, His name on Brimham! yea, the coming blast, Beneath his curtains, reads it here with me; And pauses not to number marvels past, But speeds the thunder on o'er land and sea. ROCK IDOL AT BRIMHAM. Stone! did the hand of sacerdotal fraud Shape thee into this vital type of things? Or did a million winters, on their wings Of scythe-like perseverance come abroad, To bid Conjecture stand before thee awed, And, almost severing thee from parent-earth, Make thee a marvel? Vainly giv'st thou birth To solemn fancies, building an abode Around thee, for a world of shapeless ghosts; Vainly they rise before me, calling up Kings and their masters, and imagined hosts That fight for clouds. What then? The heath-flower's cup With dew-drops feeds this fountain ever clear, And the ring'd ouzel whistles—“God is here!” STUDLEY. Behold! the Medicean Venus! O Is not this beauty? Yes, for it is truth. See how she bends in her eternal youth! E'en thus she charm'd ten thousand years ago; Ere painting's magic bade the canvas glow, Or soul inspired the marble; thus she stood Before her own Adonis of the wood! The master-piece of sculpture? Artist! No. In all divine perfection as she stands, So came she, perfect, from th' Almighty's hands, The masterpiece of Nature. Everywhere His spirit walks; but he who in strange lands Seeks her fair form, turns homeward in despair, Then seeks it in his soul, and finds it there. CRITICISM. Yet art hath less of instinct than of thought, All instinct though it seems; for as the flower Which blooms in solitude, by noiseless power, And skill divine, is wonderfully wrought, So from deep study art's high charm is caught; And as the sunny air, and dewy light, Are spun in heavenly looms, till blossoms, bright With honey'd wealth and sweetness, droop o'er-fraught, And our eyes breathe of beauty; so the bard Wrings from slow time inimitable grace; So wins immortal Music her reward, E'en with a bee's industry; and we trace The sculptor's home-thoughts thro' his labours hard, Till beams, with deathless love, the chisell'd face. FOUNTAINS ABBEY. Abbey! for ever smiling pensively, How like a thing of Nature dost thou rise, Amid her loveliest works! as if the skies, Clouded with grief, were arch'd thy roof to be, And the tall trees were copied all from thee! Mourning thy fortunes—while the waters dim Flow like the memory of thy evening hymn; Beautiful in their sorrowing sympathy; As if they with a weeping sister wept, Winds name thy name! But thou, though sad, art calm, And time with thee his plighted troth hath kept; For harebells deck thy brow, and, at thy feet, Where sleep the proud, the bee and red-breast meet, Mixing thy sighs with Nature's lonely psalm. PARTING TEARS. Scenes which renew my youth, and wake again Its earliest dreams of love and beauty!—here, E'en as in heaven, found perfect, though the tear Of frailty dims them with its earthly stain Too often and too soon! I can remain With you no longer; I must haste to things That drink the ice, which in a moment brings The chill of fifty winters, and their pain, To the sick heart. Already I grow cold In spirit; and the thought of leaving you For alien scenes, where nothing good or new Remains for crowds to show, or men to say, Instructs me—not that I in years am old, But that the tresses of my soul are grey. RETURN TO SHEFFIELD. To swelter in the town's distemper'd glow, Heart-sick to sleep, and weary wake to strife, To make a curse of hope, a broil of life, And blight the rose to bid the cypress grow, Pain's angel calls me; and I rise to go Back from the castled wood, the sainted tower— Scenes where man's home is lovely as a flower, And he himself still fair, though stain'd with woe! Where Nid, and Aire, and Wharfe through Eden glide, Or Brimham's rocks of Druid terrors tell, No longer, little lyre, may I abide; No more with Nature's lonely powers to dwell, I leave thee here on Skell's all-beauteous side; Toy of the Titans! tiny Harp, farewell!! Part Second. TO THOMAS LISTER. Bard of the Future! as the morning glows O'er lessening shadows, shine thou in this land. Till the rich drone pays Labour what he owes, “Strive unto death” against his plundering hand; And bid the temple of free conscience stand Roof'd by the sky, for ever. “As the rose, Growing beside the streamlet of the field,” Send sweetness forth on every breeze that blows; Bloom like the woodbines where the linnets build; Be to the mourner as the clouds, that shield, With wings of meeken'd flame, the summer flower; Still, in thy season, beautifully yield The seeds of beauty; sow eternal power; And wed eternal truth! though suffering be her dower Don whispers audibly; but Wharncliffe's dread, Like speechless adoration, hymns the Lord; While, smiting his broad lyre, with thunder stored, He makes the clouds his harp-strings. Gloom is spread O'er Midhope, gloom o'er Tankersley, with red Streak'd; and noon's midnight silence doth afford Deep meanings, like the preaching of the Word To dying men. Then, let thy heart be fed With honest thoughts! and be it made a lyre, That God may wake its soul of living fire, And listen to the music. O do thou, Minstrel serene! to useful aims aspire! And, scorning idle men and low desire, Look on our Father's face with meek submitted brow. Yes, Lister! bear to him who toils and sighs The primrose and the daisy, in thy rhyme; Bring to his workshop odorous mint and thyme; Shine like the stars on graves, and say, Arise, Seed sown in sorrow! that our Father's eyes May see “the bright consummate flower” of mind; And the great heart of ransom'd human kind Sing in all homes the anthem of the wise: “Freedom is peace! Knowledge is Liberty! Truth is religion.” O canst thou refuse To emulate the glory of the sun, That feedeth ocean from the earth-fed sky; And to the storm, and to the rain-cloud's hues, Saith, “All that God commandeth shall be done!” THE CHAINED EAGLE. Slow Time seems swift. Since Charles stood here with me Three years have pass'd o'er Wharncliffe's wood and stream; And Charles is busy still, where'er he be, Willing to labour, if he may but dream. Poor Pemberton! the forest speaks of thee; The eagles? No; they dwell with other things; But he who caged them here, though chain'd, is free, And might do better for us, with his wings, Than flap his mental bonds, to flatter kings. When will he fly away, and be at rest? Can he roll back the ocean to its springs? Ye chain'd in soul! what must be, shall be best: To Space and Time, their food Improvement brings; “We dwell with God in both,” Obstruction's poet sings. CASTLE HOWARD. Palfreyman! hither, with toil-strengthen'd frame, What time Napoleon warr'd on Russian snows, I came, a wanderer's privilege to claim, And gaze on deathless death, and deathless woes. The soul of truth glow'd then, as now it glows, O'er all the life and glory of these walls; Ideal Power, in pomp of gloom and flame, Call'd on my spirit then as now he calls: “Do not my sons,” he said, “deserve their fame?” I could not scorn his bright star-written name, Though, in her majesty heart-deified, A beauteous friend, all graceful, with me came; Yet I turn'd from him with a husband's pride, And bless'd the LIVING WOMAN at my side. THE THREE MARYS AT CASTLE HOWARD, IN 1812 AND 1837. The lifeless son—the mother's agony, O'erstrain'd till agony refused to feel— That sinner too I then dry-eyed could see; For I was harden'd in my selfish weel, And strength and joy had strung my soul with steel. I knew not then that man may live to be A thing of life, that feels he lives in vain— A taper, to be quench'd in misery! Forgive me, then, Caracci! if I seek To look on this, thy tale of tears, again; For now the swift is slow, the strong is weak. Mother of Christ! how merciful is pain! But, if I longer view thy tear-stain'd cheek, Heart-broken Magdalene! my heart will break. WALKLEY. Sarah and William Adams! here we stood, Roof'd by the cloud, which cast his frown between Wardsend and Loxley's moorlands. From the wood Of one-starr'd Grenno, like a sea unseen, The wind swept o'er us, seeming, in his might, To shake the steadfast rocks; while, rushing keen Beyond the edge of darkness, stormy light, As from a league-wide trumpet, on the scene A cataract of glory pour'd; and, bright In gloom, the hill-tops islanded the night Of billowy shade around us. Vale and hill, Forest and cloud, were restless as a fight; They seem'd as they would never more be still; While, anchor'd over all, the high-poised kite Saw the foam'd rivers dash their blue with white. WORDS AND THINGS. Our wordy friend in metaphor transcends All mortal scribes—his figures always strike! And when he makes of far-sought odds and ends Pictures of nothing, wonderfully like, He calls them “THOUGHTS that startle!” Evening blends Green with her red and purple with her gold; And, while yon all-hued sun-born rainbow bends O'er blush-tinged peak, cragged glen, and shadowed wold, Harmonized melodies in light are roll'd Wherever lake reflects her dying beam, Or mourns in Eden sad-voiced breeze, or stream, Or showery cloud! but ne'er will man behold The truth of beauty in a pedant's dream, Cold as his sympathies, and false as cold. MAUSOLEUM AT WENTWORTH. Hither I came—when life itself was new, And new this form of greatness dead and gone— To tremble in the gloom which draws and drew A purple veil o'er deathlike life in stone. This man a pitying look on frailty threw: Have I not heard a matron, good and true, Speak of him, with a tear upon her cheek? Knaves call'd him weak—but when was virtue weak? O ye who wring the heart until it break, And scourge pale nations with the wealth ye steal! Here, if late pardon for your crimes ye seek, To your cold souls the thoughts ye dread reveal; Think of our vulture with the gory beak! And of meek Rockingham, with humbled malice, speak. WENTWORTH HOUSE. “Now, for the enchanted palace of our youth!” But what have I with palaces to do, Taught as I am, by Nature, time, and truth, That pride can envy pomp, and hate it too? Yes; but the ideal of the fair and true Lives here in marble, by creative mind Made sacred to the glory of mankind; And if ideal beauty cannot woo Thy steps to enter Taste's proud temple—Go! Yet, wherefore? Wentworth's princely halls can show, By Vandyke limn'd, the form of one who knew How best to strike a tyrant's basest blow. Behold him! nor to curse his crimes be slow— Behold fell Strafford! man's and freedom's foe! PORTRAIT AT WENTWORTH. Was he then human? Tools of Tyrants! could This face be Strafford's? Strafford's! who his hands Wrung in Hibernia's hair, and, drunk with blood, Call'd murder wisdom! Brutal as his bands, He startled hell with crime. His savage mood Nor pity sooth'd nor reason's might could bow. But Hampden dared withstand him, Pym withstood; And men were found who laid his master low, And sent the servant—whither tyrants go. And, lo, at length, strange pangs his heart have riven! There is a touch of feeling on his brow, “For pledges left him by a saint in heav'n.” No more than this, could royal Charles allow? “Put not your trust in princes!” Why didst thou? BUST AND PORTRAIT AT WENTWORTH. This bust, which beautifully doth relate What heav'n's beloved are born to do and be; These lines, these hues, which long shall renovate Thy gentleness, thy truth, thy purity; Are all, Fitzwilliam! that remain of thee. The steward of the trampled poor is gone! The prince of charity hath bow'd to fate! The godlike friend of him that wanteth one, Finds good deeds done on earth his best estate. How long for thee God bade his angel wait! O reverend brow! thou conquerest Envy's frown, And dead, half-humanizest Faction's hate; As when a poet of time-tried renown Casts o'er the world he left the light of suns gone down. THRYBERG. Scenes of my thoughtless youth! here are ye all; Dalton! and Dalton school! and Dalton Deign! But changed ye are! or I am. Mean and small Ye seem, and humbled. Sunk into the plain, The hill is dwarf'd with age. Its coronal The glen hath lost, its ferny plumes, and, more Than these, its freedom! Thryberg's verdant wall Is here, and here the oak I knew of yore; But who, to me, their grandeur can restore? My heart hath made them bankrupt. Where they stood Stand Wentworth's halls; but not, as heretofore, Portall'd for gods. O far-known Silverwood! O cavern'd Ravensfield! Don, flowing o'er A narrower bed, bathes now a tamer shore. PROSPECT FROM THRYBERG. Thou only, Wincobank, reign'st undespoiled, King of the valley of my youth and prime, Through which the river, like a snake uncoil'd, Wanders, though tamed, a match for conquering time. Behind thee mountains, solemn and sublime, Take from the stooping skies their purply gold; And could I in that brightness steep my rhyme, And steal yon glow of green and crimson, roll'd Far o'er the realms of evening's western clime, A tale of Nature's splendour should be told Which Byron might transcribe for Scott, and deem That earth, like heav'n, hath scenes which grow not old; O let me dip my pencil in thy beam, Thou setting sun! ere death cut short this fever'd dream. RETROSPECTION. World of my boyhood! art thou what thou wast? Seen through the melancholy mist of years, Thy woods a pale diminish'd shadow cast O'er thoughts grown grey, and feelings dimm'd with tears. Our spirits, biggen'd by their griefs and fears, Sadden and dwindle, with their backward view, All they behold. Chang'd world! thy face appears Poor as the toy that pleas'd when life was new; And mournful as th' inscription, trite and true, That lingers on our little sister's grave. Roch Abbey! Canklow! Aldwark! if I crave, Now, a boy's joy, from some lone flower's deep blue, Will your loved flowers assume a pensive hue? Or smile as once they smiled, still growing where they grew? ROCH ABBEY. Pale ruin! no—they come no more, the days When thought was like a bee within a rose, Happier and busier than the beam that plays On this thy stream. The stream sings, as it flows, A song of valleys, where the hawthorn blows; And wandering through a world of flowery-ways, Even as of old; but never will it bring Back to my heart my guileless love of praise.— The blossomy hours of life's all-beauteous spring, When joy and hope were ever on the wing, Chasing the redstart for its flamy glare, The corn craik for its secret. Who can wring A healing balsam from the dregs of care, And turn to auburn curls the soul's grey hair? Yet, Abbey! pleased, I greet thee once again; Shake hands, old friend, for I in soul am old. But storms assault thy golden front in vain; Unchanged thou seem'st, though times are changed and cold; While to thy side I bring a man of pain, With youthful cheeks in furrows deep and wide, Plough'd up by Fortune's volley'd hail and rain; To truth a martyr, hated and belied; Of freedom's cause a champion true and tried. O take him to thy heart! for Pemberton Loves thee and thine, because your might hath died— Because thy friends are dead, thy glories gone— Because, like him, thy batter'd walls abide A thousand wrongs, and smile at power and pride. O bid him welcome then! and let his eyes Look on thy beauty, until blissful tears Flood the deep channels, worn by agonies, Which leave a wreck more sad than that of years. Yes; let him see the evening-purpled skies, Above thy glowing lake bend down to thee; And the love-list'ning vesper-star arise, Slowly, o'er silent earth's tranquillity; And all thy ruins weeping silently; Then, be his weakness pitied and forgiv'n, If when the moon illumes her deep blue sea, His soul could wish to dream of thee in heav'n, And, with a friend his bosom'd mate to be, Wander through endless years, by silver'd arch and tree. Part Third. TO ELIZABETH. “Write me a song for Betsy,” said thy sire: Lady! it is already written—here, On the charged brain, in tears, and gloom, and fire: Read it when I am dust. My waning year Is shaking down its leaves. I soon shall be Safe, even from myself, where pain and fear Disturb not him who sleepeth. Then to thee The buried dead shall speak, and thou shalt hear A spirit's voiceless words. He shall appear To thee when awe is silence in thy soul— Yea, thou with him shalt go withersoe'er His feet have been. The lifeless shall control The living: and, though worlds between us roll, Dwell with thee in my thoughts, or linger near. Then, lady! gaze with me o'er Wharncliffe lone; Or stand, in thought, on Kinder's crest sublime; Or hear a prophet's voice, from Grina stone, Denounce thy country's tyrants, in my rhyme. O that Peronnet Thompson's mental might, Or thy stern lyre, John Milton, were my own; Or that my voice were mountain thunders, blown, As from a trumpet, in the dead of night! Then would I do the poor of Britain right; Then should my song, like Russia's winter, freeze Abaddon's host, guilt-petrified in flight; And the roused spirit of Demosthenes, Strong as heaven's flame from tempests ranged for fight, Fulmine o'er darkened lands a storm of light. “My voice,” men say, “is like a convent bell, Rung by red light'nings, at the midnight hour, While, crashing from the tempest-shaken tower, Its moss-grown fragments mingle with the yell Of winds that howl o'er graves.” But if I swell The fire-toned thunder's hymn, I have no power To shake to-morrow's rain-drop from a flower, No wish to bring the deluge I foretell. Yet, while the bell of ages tolls in vain O'er buried tyrants, may I not be heard By tyrants living, sinning, hated, fear'd; And, like the midnight cannon's friendly roar, Flash'd through the portals of the wind and rain, Warn haughty navies from a fatal shore? CLOUDLESS STANAGE. Why, shower-loved Derwent! have the rainbows left thee? Mam-Tor! Win-Hill! a single falcon sails Between ye; but no airy music wails. Who, mountains! of your soft hues hath bereft ye, And stolen the dewy freshness of your dales? Dove-stone! thy cold drip-drinking fountain fails; Sun-darken'd shadows, motionless, are on ye; Silence to his embrace of fire hath won ye; And light, as with a shroud of glory, veils The Peak and all his marvels. Slowly trails One streak of silver o'er the deep dark blue Its feathery stillness, while of whispered tales The ash, where late his quivering shade he threw, Dreams o'er the thoughtful plant that hoards its drops of dew. NOON ON GREAT KINDER. When last I look'd on thee, thy brow was black With trouble, and beneath it flames flashed out; While on thine awful face the heav'ns flung back The red glare of thy lightnings, Kinderscout! And all thy brethren answered with a shout Their monarch's voice, that spake from sea to sea, O'er all their cataracts. But now the trout Sleeps in thy voiceless runlets. Now the bee Alone is restless here: he sings to thee An ode of praise, where, reddening like the rose, Amid the hoof-marks of the thunder, glows The cloud-fed berry; and the clouds, to me, (While blusheth wide around the purple flower,) Seem mute, in honour of thy noontide hour. Mountains! ye awe and tire me. Fare ye well! And let the tempests love ye. But, below, The happy homed-and-hearth'd affections dwell. Amid yon floral sea, where daisies blow And children gather them, the village bell Saith that the young are married; while the old Talk of glad yesterdays, or fondly tell Of buried loves. For joy is grief foretold! And there young widows' hearts grow deadly cold, And the poor orphan's smile is faint and brief, When marriage chimes are heard o'er grange and wold. Yet comfort there I seek, and joy in grief; For man, by feelings strong as death controll'd, Gives heart for heart, and knows that hearts are never sold. TO THOMAS CROSSLEY. “Poetry,” critics say, “is dead or dying.” Is life then dead, or can religion die? She whose broad pinions gather strength by flying O'er new-made graves, or manless halls, where sighs The wind of midnight to the clouded sky, And hurrying stars! E'en as the skylark flies, Poetry lives and still will soar, while flows A daughter's tear because her mother dies; While on a child's grave grass or daisy grows; Or o'er his coffin'd son a father bows His locks of snow. Yes, Bard of Ovenden, Poetry lives! for, lo! with thee she goes Where leaps the streamlet down the breezy glen; With me, where God bids law cursed slaves be men! A DREAM. I dream'd that, tired with travel, I return'd To Blacklow's summit, and stood there with God Alone, at midnight. Side by side we trod The heath; and while around us rock'd and burn'd The mountains, like a mountain'd sea of flame, A gilded worm pronounced in scorn His name! I, with my foot, the reptile would have spurn'd, But could not. We stood still as death! That worm Then spun slim films around th' Almighty's form, Binding the hands that lift the seas, the feet That will tread out the stars! and while, in mirth, It spake this curse, I heard my own heart beat: “With worse than barrenness I curse thee, Earth! Henceforth, let every child be hopeless from his birth!” But God said, “No! surely thou shalt not see Every child hopeless, because thou art vile; For thou art thy own victim, watch'd by me, And I sheath vengeance in a dreadful smile. But ere I bless thy curses for mankind, And make them curses infinite to thee, Thousands of thousands, foodless as the wind— Yea, thousand, thousand, thousand men shall be Care-hunted to the grave, by thine and thee. And thou more crimes and criminals shalt make, Than all earth's monsters heretofore have made: Hell from beneath shall rise to bless thee, Snake! And Death, to sum his profits by thy trade, Count through all ages past, their men and states betray'd.” CONISBOROUGH CASTLE. In other days, time-darken'd Conisb'rough, Men thought of Hengist when they spoke of thee! My native river murmurs near thee now, As then it murmur'd, hasting to the sea, Through hazel bowers, where memory loves to be; But in these days, thy pilgrims whisper low The name of Scott, and join with his thy name. Him, the Napoleon of Parnassus, thou Hast seen with Shakspeare equal deem'd in fame; Nor may the Cæsar of the Muses claim, His throne unshared. Twice thirteen years are past, Since hither, almost dead with care, I came, What time another Cæsar fiercely cast O'er earth his stormy shade, which kings beheld aghast. Through Russian wastes that Cæsar chased a cloud: Calm was its aspect; for it had the power To make his crowded host a lifeless crowd, He being conquer'd in that fated hour, Which gave his queen destruction for a dower. Slow was its motion, and few accents loud Broke from its chamber'd thunder as it fled; But, when it stopp'd and spake, the conqueror bow'd, Lower than vanquish'd kings, his laurel'd head. They, waking from the vileness of their dread, Gazed on the self-crown'd wretch, in mean surprise; Then, with the vulgar dust, which he had spread Around the consul's chair, bedimm'd his eyes, And bade him die, as baffled baseness dies. Yet better was it, that the Fool of Force Triumph'd by force, and fell by force subdued, Than that the ancient thrones of foot and horse Had quelled, at once, the uproused multitude, Whom giant wrongs with Titan might embued. Well fought the people under Terror's wing; And banded monarchs trembled, fled, and sued; For Terror reign'd, Gaul's omnipresent king! And homed, on tyrants' hearths the storm they brewed! They serve us still, with strife! still, still renew'd; The fight of fate accelerates their doom; Themselves they mar, by battle, fraud, and feud; And in large letters, of mixed flame and gloom, Write, “The Republic! cometh, and will come.” Come the Republic then! Or come the will Of one wise despot! Let the Nation sway Or be swayed well! But we will not be still Of fifty thousand kingly-wolves the prey: O Britain, sweep them from thy hearth away! What! shall they reign alone, like the simoom, Kings of the dead? Not so! we toil, and pay; And here we perish pall'd beneath their gloom— Ere Mockery, throned o'er London's ashes, say, “Behold a manless land! a nation's tomb!” The heavens shall cry, Ha, ha! and shout their doom; Their names shall be a byword of dismay; Chaff for the whirlwind shall their pomp become; Their homes be graves, and dust for ruin they. Come the republic then! but not the strife Of want-struck millions for immediate bread! “The labour of the poor man is his life,” And on our lives shall palaced fraud be fed? “They who rob him, strike Me!” the Lord hath said; “They break my everlasting covenant! And therefore worms beneath their pride are spread; For are not murderers number'd with the dead? Fainting, their sons shall ask, their daughters pant, For drink and bread, in vain; and both shall flee Unbless'd, go where they may, o'er land or sea, And learn how hard to bear are scorn and want! For I (the poor man's God) his strength will be, And shake the dead leaves down, but save the tree!” LYRICS FOR MY DAUGHTERS. SONG. [Oh, Love, thou art a heav'n on earth] Ye Banks and Braes O' Bonny Doon. Oh, Love, thou art a heav'n on earth, And earth is heav'n enough for thee! But souls must have their second birth, And far, far hence thy home must be: We go to join the lost and true, Our task perform'd, our foes forgiv'n: In wind and rain, on earth we grew, And need not fear the calm of heav'n. Beneath dim star, and clouded moon, Torn hearts may blissful secrets tell: Bright shines the ice on rocks at noon, And hoary locks become thee well: What, though 'tis sad our way to wing From cares that give a charm to pain? Our withering autumn shall be spring, And these dry branches bud again. SONG. [“The Home of Taste,” say souls of dust] Auld Lang Syne. “The Home of Taste,” say souls of dust, “Is not for men who toil: For bread alone they till, and must, Life's hopeless soil.” But here comes he whom no one knows, The thrall of tasteless power; Why plucks he, as he homeward goes, The hawthorn flower? Red Rose, that lov'st the cottage door, If hope within there be! Why stops a wretch so tired and poor, To look on thee? Oh, yet the greatest and the least A Home of Taste will find! And Knowledge spread her beauteous feast For all mankind! The only high and heart-based throne Is unclass'd virtue's prize; For who are great? The good alone, They only wise. And what, sweet rose, sweet hawthorn flower, To hind, or artisan, Are Taste's pure charm, and Beauty's power, But God in Man? CHANT. [The angels are our brothers] The angels are our brothers; Let us like them become, And emulate in beauty The first-born of our home: Lord! we are thine, and they are thine: In rescued Eden, let us twine With mortal virtues love divine, And be earth's angels! SONG. [When days of frost and snow were over] The Light of other Days. When days of frost and snow were over, I told the sleepless moon, I told the stars, that my true lover Would see his Mary soon: Now, children seek the daisied closes, Birds sing the green world o'er, And woodbines wed the wild hedge roses, But William comes no more! Ere wintry days again are over, Ere daisies come again, I shall not need a faithless lover, Nor wish for rest in vain: Oh, Woodbine flower, our last was spoken Where now thou flauntest free! Oh, wild Hedge Rose, my heart is broken! Thou bloom'st in vain for me. SONG. [Sing her a song of the white-headed one] Long Ago. Sing her a song of the white-headed one, Gone, gone before! Gone, gone before! Sing to her tears of the sire who is gone! When to come more? Never more! Heart-breaking sea, when she weepeth alone, Tell his sad child that the white-headed one Went to the grave blessing her who was gone Wide, wide waves o'er! Wide waves o'er! Now sighs the widow unto the lone sea, “Bring her again! Bring her again! Sea, let the sad find a helper in thee! Bring her again! Soon again!” Wild was the parting, but may there not be Tears which are blissful? when sings the old sea, “Mother and Child! thank the Good God for me; Meet, meet again! Meet again!” SONG. [For Spring, and flowers of Spring] God Save the Queen. For Spring, and flowers of Spring, Blossoms, and what they bring, Be our thanks given; Thanks for the maiden's bloom; For the sad prison's gloom; And for the sadder tomb; E'en as for Heav'n! Great God, thy will is done, When the soul's rivers run Down the worn cheeks; Done when the righteous bleed; When the wrong'd vainly plead; Done in th' unended deed, When the heart breaks. Lo, how the dutiful Snows, clothe in beautiful Life, the dead earth! Lo, how the clouds distil Riches o'er vale and hill, While the storm's evil-will Dies in its birth! Bless'd is th' unpeopled down; Bless'd is the crowded town, Where the tired groan; Pain but appears to be; What are Man's fears to Thee, God! if all tears shall be Gems on thy throne? SONG. [When the pale worker faints] Robin Adair. When the pale worker faints, Making no moan, Though his unutter'd plaints Rise to God's throne, What from despair can keep Languor too tired to sleep, Sorrow too sad to weep? Music alone! It costs nothing, and the starving man has nothing. Bring music to the poor man's hearth, and he will not seek it in the alehouse. Milton, poor, old, and blind, Fated to bear Worst woes that scourge his kind, Did not despair: What, behind curtains worn, Where his night knew no morn, Held up his heart forlorn? Music was there. Then, to the hopeless one, Thus, if you can, Sing, weary wife or son, Wasted and wan: “Though pain our portion be, High is our destiny: Born thrall of poverty, Still thou art Man!” “Homer and Plato were Kindred of thine; With thee the angels share Utt'rance divine; Heav'n hath thine image got; Jesus partook thy lot; And where night cometh not Thy sun will shine.” PLAINT. Dark, deep, and cold the current flows Unto the sea where no wind blows, Seeking the land which no one knows. O'er its sad gloom still comes and goes The mingled wail of friends and foes, Borne to the land which no one knows. Why shrieks for help yon wretch, who goes With millions, from a world of woes, Unto the land which no knows? Though myriads go with him who goes, Alone he goes where no wind blows, Unto the land which no one knows. For all must go where no wind blows, And none can go for him who goes; None, none return whence no one knows. Yet why should he who shrieking goes With millions, from a world of woes, Reunion seek with it or those? Alone with God, where no wind blows, And Death, his shadow—doom'd, he goes: That God is there the shadow shows. Oh, shoreless Deep, where no wind blows! And, thou, oh, Land which no one knows! That God is All, His shadow shows. THE YEAR OF SEEDS. 1848. TO WILLOUGHBY WOOD, ESQ., DEPLORING ITS UNWORTHINESS THE MORE, BECAUSE EXCELLENCE ALONE CAN HARMONIZE WITH WORTH LIKE HIS; AND ALTHOUGH HIS BROTHER FOXHUNTERS WILL MARVEL WHY SUCH A COMPOSITION SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO ONE OF THEM;—I DEDICATE THIS CYCLE OF REVOLUTIONARY SONNETS. I. Toy of the Titans! Tiny Harp! again I quarrel with the order of thy strings, Establish'd by the law of sonnet-kings, And used by giants who do nought in vain. Was Petrarch, then mistaken in the strain That charms Italia? Were they tasteless things That Milton wrought? And are they mutterings Untuneful, that pay Wordsworth with pleased pain? No. But I see that tyrants come of slaves; That states are won by rush of robbers' steel; And millions starved and tortured to their graves, Because as they are taught men think and feel; Therefore, I change the sonnet's slavish notes For cheaper music, suited to my thoughts. II. Far uplands, gleaming suddenly, advance; And under the broad moon their farthest snows Shine like the sunbright lakes of new-found lands; While from her forehead she her dark hair throws, And (lord of midnight,) the rapt poet stands Mute as the Roman, from the shore of France Gazing on Britain o'er the virgin sea; And weaving then the fates that were to be, For generations, times, and climes, and strands, Unknown and unconceived. Oh, unborn Year! Disclose the comings which the past commands, The joy, the woe, the crime, the hope, the fear, That bid the future join the ages gone, Still uttering the eternal mandate, “On!” III. In the mark'd hut, whose flamed-up smoke declares That morn approaches, heavily snores one Who loves the moon, and seldom sees the sun: Upon his chested picklocks, gun, and snares, He sits, and nods. Starting, he wakes, and stares Red as the fire, after his boys, who run Through the quick-closing door, into the dun Cold road, for warmth; while his gloom'd wife prepares His morning supper. Why do men deny His right to live by honest labour? Why, Ev'n as the desert's tiger, is he free? Gamekeeper once, now poacher, (When to be Burglar and cutthroat?) the world's worst he dares; Because he stole one of our Master's hares! IV. Why do the tears swell in his gloom'd wife's eyes? To her and hers he is already lost. Oh, conscious river, crisping in the frost! Thou snow, that stiflest echo! and ye skies, Alive with stars, that seem to watch the glade, And, there, some object, that all ghastly lies! The last night of the dying Year hath seen Two widows and twelve orphans newly made! And Law will have another victim soon. Not ten yards from our Lady's wayside spring; Where daisy-rill, iced o'er, is glittering, The lover's gate, and gospel-thorn between; Upon its back lies stark a horrid thing, With dead eyes staring at the ghastly moon. V. Not die? Who saith that Nature cannot die? Everywhere spreadeth, all things covereth Echoless, motionless, unbounded snow The vagrant's footfall waketh no reply: Starved wretch! he pauseth—Whither would he go? He listeneth finger-lipp'd, and nothing saith Of all the thoughts that fill'd his soul with woe, But, freezing into stiffness, lacketh breath. Dumb deadness pilloweth day on every hill. Earth has no sound, no motion the dead sky; No current, sensible to ear or eye, The muffled stream's unconquerable will. The pulse of Being seemeth standing still; And January is the King of Death. VI. Give not our blankets, tax-fed Squire, to him, Thy willing pauper, with the dangerous brow! He is not worthier, generous Squire, than thou, But stronger far, and sound in wind and limb. Know'st thou yon widow? She is wise and chaste; And comely, though her famish'd eyes wax dim. Her husband built a house upon the waste, And lost it: they who found it should make haste With help for her who, else, will die to-day. She hath no blankets! and no parish-pay: But she hath frosted feet, a fireless grate, A well-swept floor—by neighbour's feet untrod! Tears, which are ice; a starved dog, a clean plate, Her wedding ring, her bible—and her God! VII. Ralph Leech believes (and he can read and write,) That Conference Sunday-schools have saved the nation. He would compel the dark to seek his light, Yet hates, for freedom's sake, state-education. That corn laws are “Man's wisdom, and God's mercy;” That Prairie is the Book of Common Prayer; And that one Shakspeare is a fat old Player; He doubts no more than that Canton's in Jersey. Though cold the night, how fast his chapel fills! Why? Sir De Suckem hath a message sent, Urging the Suckems of the People's Cause To prop Saint Suckem's Navigation laws; Therefore, our friends petition Parliament Against cheap sugar, slavery, and steam mills! VIII. All hail, Westknab! Great Kinder! Blakelowscar! Stanedge! Winhill! Storm's Blackstone! From afar When ye come forth in ether clear and still, Sad tidings ye convey to Hargate-rill Of coming wreck and elemental war. While broadens the bright sun, or noontide star; As if, corrupted by their uncurb'd will, The lofty and the bright rejoiced in ill. So, when drew nigh doom'd Britain's baleful hour, Portents of mightiest Evil Spirits cast Dire brightness on the face of Evil Power; And love and labour, heart-struck, stood aghast, While horror wrote, beneath th' affrighted sky A blood-red warning for eternity. IX. Rivers are torrents, vales and plains are lakes, When February draws her curtains down. Rain! rain! The universal snow forsakes Moorland and mountain, forest, farm, and town. Rain! Rain! it pours, it pours. Red land-floods drown Blue ocean's baffled tide. With calm cold frown, The cold grey rock, that saw death's cradle, wakes From his old dream of drowth, to find his home In cloud-hung deluge. The old forest shakes His wrinkled forehead o'er the whirling foam Of inland sea; and with the haste that takes Life's sad last blessing, down the revels come Of sky and upland, mix'd in cataract That rioteth in waste, like one who long hath lack'd. X. How like the clear, bright ether, which brings fire, Wind, rain, and darkness, is the cruel eye Of plotting Statecraft! Everywhere conspire Thrones, and thy despotlings, Feudality, To crush the hopes of Freedom everywhere. The spoil of nations is their common fund. Their first card was the baffled Sonderbund; They play'd and lost! and still to lose prepare. But thou art reckless, Orleans! pause awhile. Thou wilt not? Play, then. Ye again have lost, Kings of the robb'd! and at your proper cost, Must risk, henceforth, your stakes and trumps of guile. What, though your Kinglings, in themselves a host, Will pack your cards? They tremble, while they smile. XI. Oh, that the winds of March could wither up The never-sleeping treachery of Kings! What, though Commotion hath the whirlwind's wings, If blind Misrule is still the Unwithstood? What, though wrong'd men have startled Fraud and Force, If the leagued dynasties of Foot and Horse Brood o'er a new Niagara of blood, And drunken Waste still hugs her empty cup? Hark, how the World's benetted miscreancies Chaunt their growl'd slang, for altar, jail, and throne, While in the Bael of sworded villanies Each paltry despotling protects his own! Proving the soundness of the saw accursed, That little tyrants always are the worst. XII. Cold sneerers, dead to pity, lost to shame! It came, it cometh, “the tremendous gloom,” That hurl'd the sire-dethroner to his doom; God whispers—Hark! he names “The dreaded Name Of Demogorgon!” Still your wolfish laws Bare chain'd Prometheus to your vulture-claws; And hope ye to escape the Torturer's fate? Though long delay'd, it cometh, as it came! It cometh—and will find you taught too late, Soul-chaining, chain'd in soul, repentant never, Darkest, yet darkening! Then, the fated frown Will cast ye deep beneath all darkness down, And brighten'd by your infamous renown, All other infamy look bright for ever. XIII. Hath April wept herself into a dream Of wondrous joy? or a reality Fairer and brighter than all dreaming? Deem Not lightly, Bard, of her regality In goodness. Lo, the beautiful are strong! Lo, gentlest-love is power, whose noiseless stream Keeps fresh the sea of life, which else would teem Only with plagues! Oh, gold-bill'd Ouzle's song! Hath love's still might waked thee? Love's April! coldly Primrosy airs breathe round thee. Clouds behold thee, And mix thy music with their blushes. Morn, Dew-glistening Morn, is silvering rock and tree, While shadows shorten o'er the whitening thorn, Perch'd on whose topmost-twig the woodwele hymneth thee. XIV. Red evening, in her green-and-silver robes, Looks from the uplands on the lakes below, O'er realms of hawthorn, white with little globes In which is folded up May's fragrant snow. With closing eyes, to sleep the daisies go; Beneath the fire-flower'd broom awakes the hare; And gentle winds are waiting, fain to blow News of the open'd rose to sons of care Who toil for coffins! where the brave despair. There, lo, in Trade's dark street, his trade of woe The ever-weary village-genius plies! Poor Boy! he sees not that he daily dies; Though oft he longs to see the pink'd flower grow Where, wing'd with love's glad strength, the wheeling plover cries. XV. Oh, many-window'd House, whose light is gloom! A homeless youth (brought by despair, to die Where hope comes not,) pants in thy upper room, And sees the May-Day lark ascend the sky; But flower of May shall never meet his eye, Nor mate the earth-worm's all-forgotten guest. No. She who would have call'd the golden broom, Or hawthorn-flower, to love him in the tomb, Hath long been haven'd where the weary rest. Who sees him weep? Who hears his latest sigh? What hireling fiend mocks twice his parting groan? His sire, his sister, the last friend, are gone To Sin's Australia, where the bad thrive best; And in a crowded world, he dies alone. XVI. Not here, not here! I beg it as a boon; If ye dare weep and hope to be forgiv'n, Lay not the poet of the village here, Where comes no sunlight, save the grin of noon! But to that grave-yard, full of peace and heav'n, Where, not unhonour'd, rests a village seer, (Who lived beloved, to die forgotten soon,) Bear ye the child of flowers. Oh, lay him near His grandsire's bones! for thither—when the wind Bends the young twig, or shakes the old leaf down— May stray (too scornful of the plunder'd town,) Some hopeful, worth-respecting bard sublime. Who (in man's ashes honouring human kind,) May read the name of both, and do it into rhyme. XVII. Why? If the unremember'd are a crew That yet will number all beneath the sun, Though words outlive the evil that men do, And written be their names in blood and flame, Ev'n of the famous famed shall be not one! Why lingers, then, on his greystone, the name Of one whom all forget? Moss, water, air, Day, night, ask Why? And our poor hearts declare That ev'n this record is a sort of fame! But though mute words may hallow long the spot Where the forgotten say, “Forget us not,” We write on graves the heart's last wish in vain! And dust and lime, at last, alone remain Where mind that was can never be again. XVIII. Would they were written, (and in heaven they are,) The patient deeds of men of low estate! Esteem'd so little, but how truly great! When will their modest beams be hail'd afar, And peacefully smile down the pomps of war? Oh, when will Labour's weary sons descry, Illumining with love an equal sky, The honour'd rays of Toil's eternal star? I know that our Redeemer lives; I know That well He marks our strife with want and fear; Our long-assured inheritance of woe! I know that his good angels love to write Our humblest deeds in everlasting light; But Here Men Toil For Man's Redemption Here! XIX. And, Wordsworth, yet, thy soul, in good-abounding, Will brim a world-wide cup, with purest good, And be to sever'd lands a saviour flood, (Not the loud-sounding, but the ever-sounding!) With wafted blessings lonest isles surrounding: The gentle ripple, and its low, sad wind, Have found materials which the wise shall find Broad cities of the just on all shores founding. Grand is thy temple for the soul-freed slave, “With its foundations laid beneath the grave!” And safe the bud which thou “with dewdrops shieldest!” Then, hymn not thou pomp's pagan-priests and stalls; Doom'd statecraft's doom'd religion of stone walls! Such things are cold dead rubbish, “where thou buildest.” XX. Not that there is no greatness in the fane That homes the spirit of man's deepest dread; Chapel, Morai, Cathedral! Not in vain The temple built with hands its roof hath spread Beneath th' unpillar'd blue, wherever rain Falls, or fire burns. For if the sleepless main Clasps not an isle man-peopled to his breast; But there some tokens of Hope's doubt attest The deathless sov'reignty of Death and Pain, Great is the least! as will the greatest be, When moss shall creep o'er London's homeless walls, And, taught by nation-humbling funerals, The Pilgrim of the Future there shall see Dead Worship's Skeleton! and pausing sigh, “Saint Paul's!” XXI. Church of the Hamlet! thy grey tower and thee Coeval elms hide from the passer-by: Temple within a temple! thou can'st see, Unseen thyself, the pilgrim, quietly Seated below; or coming funeral; Or wedding-party's quicker pace, to me Sadder than funeral's slow solemnity, Its young, white bearers, or its sable pall. But I tread on thy graves. Lo, freshly blown, June's trellised flowers o'er-top the ancient wall Of the good curate's garden! peeping down, As if to read, with me, on stones moss-grown, Names of the dead! whose doings none recall; Whose doom—Oblivion! is the doom of all. XXII. Though thou no cloud in breezeless heav'n beholdest, Foreshowing Gentianella! from the clown Thy bright intensity of blue thou foldest; And he, assured of rain, his scythe lays down. Hast thou no deeper knowledge? Say, for right Strove roused France vainly? Shall the Muscovite From Fiume steam for London? Eager, here, To wreathe with thorn the patriot-martyr's crown, And vaunt base scorn of hated Liberty, The feudal horde snuffs coming mischief. Peer, And squire, (and would-be squire and peer,) agree To ban the wretch who struggles to be free; And, grinning, shrug the yet-unknouted shoulders That may be bared, ere long, to strange beholders. XXIII. Oh, can July with woodbines ring her fingers, And crown with roses her too regal head, While, pale as snow, distracted Freedom lingers, Gazing on cities where her best have bled? Worriers of Nations! render up your dead! Calabrian Polecat! many dead are thine: Twice on thy people's heart's blood hast thou fed. Cur of Vienna! can thy teeth be red With Roman gore, and desolation's wine, And thou a Cæsar? Be thou, then, the last That Roman will endure, or Europe see. Oh, Etna's Isle! Rome! Venice! Italy! Among your martyr's bones these vermin cast, And on their doings let them feast or fast. XXIV. The footprints of departed life remain For hours, or years, or age-long years of years, On sand, clay, stone. Thus, chroniclers of tears Die, but not so Time's History of Pain. Rooted on graves, Truth bears a living flower! Man may forgive, but wounds their scars retain As warnings! and the Powers of Good ordain That to forget shall not be in our power. For worst ills, too, have roots: they are the fruit Of plotted action worn to habitude; And the grey dynasties of Force might live, Safe in their privilege of fraud and feud, If agony died recordless and mute, And to forget were easy as forgive. XXV. The heath-flower reddens. Purple Guttergrub, To slay the moorcock cometh, fierce and fighty. King of a dog-cart, and his shooting-club; Sublime in conflict with starved berry-getters; And teaching poor folks to respect their betters; He thinks he is, at least, the King Almighty. How like a toothless bitch that fain would bite, he Calls freetrade-humbugs “Scoundrel, Scamp, and Scrub!” Yet, like a thief who sees a constable, He drops, when blustering most, his under jaw! Ho, every slave from Perth to Dunstable, Take from your looms and plates this magnate's paw, And he shall yet become of lawless Law The best Reformer that the world e'er saw! XXVI. Seven-Childed Widow! are thy boys at home? Why, singly, seek'st thou food on wastes of stone? With coward outrage Kinglingdom hath sown Even the desert! and they dare not come, Though they are starving! Therefore, doth she roam God's keeper'd Moor, eager to sell for bread Its only crop. But, Tyrant-sparing Heav'n! Down come the hills—a sea of fire and foam! The small speck covereth Light, as with a shroud. Thou art a Night of clouds, thou little cloud! Who into lightning, with his heavy tread, Stamps the blind darkness, o'er the mountains spread? Where is the Mother of the starving seven? She shrieks! Deaf Deluge seizeth her. She's dead. XXVII. August! 'tis passing pleasant to behold Thy rising cornstack, and exulting wain; Or, while the workers gather in the grain, Gaze on thy seas of life-sustaining gold; Or, wake the grey of earliest morn, and climb Up to thy mountain'd wildernesses cold, When nought is moving on the silent wold, Except the shadow of heaven's only cloud. Who would not seek thy solitudes sublime, To tread their shoreless purple all alone. And of their proud solemnity be proud? Surely, the heart were made of steel or stone, That did not feel their grandeur, and confess “The might, the majesty of loneliness.” XXVIII. We are not lonely, Kinderscout! I stand Here, with thy sire, and gaze, with him and thee, On desolation. This is Liberty! I want no wing, to lift me from the land, But look, soul-fetter'd, on the wild and grand. Oh, that the dungeon'd of the earth were free As these fix'd rocks, whose summits bare command Yon cloud to stay, and weep for Man, with me! Is this, then, solitude? To feel our hearts Lifted above the world, yet not above The sympathies of brotherhood and love? To grieve for him who from the right departs? And strive, in spirit, with the martyr'd good? “Is this to be alone?” Then, welcome solitude. XXIX. Month of the fire-tinged leaves! why shall December Scatter them, saying, “Honour to the strong?” Quietest Month of Robin Redbreast's song! Month of its sweetest quietness, September! Thought's Month! pale townsmen, stretch'd in pain, remember Thy second bloom of dewy flowers, and long In vain, to wander with the golden gorse, Where heav'n's blue brightens, and thy blue bells throng Over the uplands. Village children learn Early, to seek them there. The poor man's horse Rejoices, too; and while the gorgeous fern Deepens the glory of thy yellow wastes, The sad-brow'd gipsy to their greenness hastes, And to thy fountain'd swamps the worm-fed birds return. XXX. Art thou a colourist? Mark, how yon red Poppy, and that bright patch of yellow broom, Cliff-borne above green depths and purply gloom, Like spark and blaze on smiling darkness shed, Give and take beauty! Mark, too, overhead, How the rich verdure of this ancient tree, And the deep purple of the bank agree To thrive in partnership! And while the bed Of the clear stream, through tints of every hue, Lifts its bathed pebbles, lo! to brighten all, The little harebell brings its bit of blue, And is a gainer! happy to behold Red blessing green, and purple gilding gold; Of light and shade a marriage festival! XXXI. Ay, startle with the sound of falling leaves Yon white-hair'd man, October! he, like thee, To summer's glowing brightness fondly cleaves, And doom'd no more of hope's glad crew to be, Speaks of his mournful doom reproachfully. His year hath gather'd in its golden sheaves. The weary wretch complains, that he must sleep. Because his work is done, the idler grieves; Because he can no longer get or keep The things that call on men to toil and weep. Then, let thy far-off sea-voiced winds growl out Their “Here-we-come!” forestalling accents deep Of Doom's dread trumpet! when the heav'ns will shout, “Hasten to Judgment, Child of Death and Doubt!” XXXII. Flower-weeping April starts to life again, When arch October for November weaves A wedding garment in a shroud of tears. 'Tis made of pearlets splinter'd from the rain; Or dewdrops shaken from the nodding spears That guard the cold roots of the bare blackthorn; And flowers (like April's) hasten to adorn Its mix'd hues, won from sunset. Through fall'n leaves The primrose peeps! homed where the wren abides; The violet, too! that would be loved, yet hides Her beauty, dark with passion; and the whin, Pale want's rough friend, laughs out to all “Good Morrow,” And calls no child of woe a child of sin, But, April-blossom'd, hoards a smile for sorrow. XXXIII. November's marriage-peal, far off, is booming: The bridegroom's face is sorrowfully glooming; He saith, “December's chilling mist is coming!” His gait is feeble, and his back is bow'd. The sad wind suddenly its moaning husheth; Hark! scarcely heard, the unseen runlet gusheth! But soon again the moaning wind outrusheth, And seemeth bickering with some mournful cloud. Beneath the sickly moon the owl is flying; Not to the misty moon the owl is crying; Not to the owl the startled rat replying: November married April, and is dying! Near him, his young bride patiently is sighing; And, lo, the moon hath cast away her shroud! XXXIV. Alas, Victoria! Nation-loved Regina! Thy Kinglings make their infamy our own. England! where now is saviour-sold Messina? Slain are her sons, her palaces o'erthrown. Thy felon Steuart was not mean and base As Blum's destroyer. Give him, then, thy hand, Thou loathed of Nature! Dost thou know the land In which the loathing earth-worm slinks not down, When sad winds name thee, near her dwelling-place? Betrayer of Mankind in Freedom's name! Who doth not think of thee and thine with shame? The damn'd of old, redeem'd by thy disgrace, Brighten in hell. The angels suffer pain, Blushing for thee, where Eliot, Hampden, Vane, Ask of each other, “Died we, then, in vain?” XXXV. Methinks, I see thy bravest of the brave Pale on his blighted deck. Whom tends he there? The woman-fiend who serves a devil-queen, And that queen's husband. On the deep they stare! For, lo, upright, starts from his watery grave One, whose death-pangs two there have caused and seen! Shrieks the King-miscreant, “What with us wants he?” And all see death! two, death and infamy! Tired Hell's Deputed Traitress! thy worst foe, When execration writes thy vilest deed, Could not in damning story wish to read A sadder trilogy of words of woe Than “Britain! Nelson! Carracciolo!” And yet thou seem'st not vile as thou would'st be! XXXVI. Realm-Stealing Patron of all states and men! Thy flag the sign of peace-pretended war, Wherever flying! would that thou could'st see Thyself as others see thee! Thou would'st, then, Knowing thyself, see others as they are. Erin would cease to stench the ocean-wave With victim-freights of helots, nick-named free; Nor would that Hell of Nations be thy grave. Oh, never may she see thee wreck'd with spoil! A beggar, with all scorn by beggary named! Pride's meanest cringer! asking leave to toil Of her, once lowest of earth's poorest poor! And in thy vileness hounded from her door, Yet fain to kiss her foot, and not ashamed! XXXVII. Tyrants! ye are an unimproving race; And 'tis the nature of the conquering base To trample on the helpless till he die: So, ye have advertised for Kossuth's head! For Kossuth lives! nor yet is Freedom dead. Oh, yet her blood will blaze from sky to sky! Yet, yet o'er Man's Rebellion will be pour'd, In seas of fire, the universal horde Whose name is Slave! Then, wilt thou, Destiny, Write in her blood, o'er blood-quench'd Hungary, “Here thou hast won the gate of boundless sway; Steam hence for London, Triple-Million'd Sword!” Or, on the quenchless heav'ns, “Behold the way To Petersburgh and Moscow, Liberty!” XXXVIII. What said that jailer jail'd, who would have been, Had he been just, of men the greatest man? “Europe, ere long, will be republican, Or Cossack.” What say they, whom we have seen Risking dominion for their own vile ban? “Better the Cossack than the artisan! Better one master, than the public will!” Ay, dig your mean grave deep, ye swift to screen Wrong and the wronger! for the self-betray'd Are God's abandon'd. Ye shall be obey'd. Long-waiting Nicholas is patient still; Tending his work of deadliest sin and woe, And for his neighbours, over plain and hill Sowing worst weeds, which, ye have sworn, shall grow! XXXIX. I dream'd that God was Silence. Air was dead, And Life a corpse laid out. The clouds had died Of sunless cold. O'er all things snow was spread, Mute as the billows of a frozen sea; And, voiceless, the eternal wind swept wide Under dumb skies, o'er steel-like sea and land. Echo herself had perish'd, but reply From her none needed was, where time forgot The letters of his name, and sound was not, And motion soundless; and all victory Crown'd freezing Death, who, with world-covering hand, And sword-like pen—and with an inward laugh— On Mind's vast grave, wrote dead Hope's epitaph In ice for ink: “Her Dream was Liberty.” XL. What Gods are these? Bright red, or white and green, Some of them jockey-capp'd and some in hats, The gods of vermin have their runs, like rats. Each has six legs, four moving, pendent two, Like bottled tails, the tilting four between. Behold Land-Interest's compound Man-and-Horse, Which so enchants his outraged helot-crew, Hedge-gapping, with his horn, and view-halloo, O'er hunter's clover—glorious broom and gorse! The only crop his godship ever grew: Except his crop of hate, and smouldering ire, And cloak'd contempt, of coward insult born, And hard-faced labour, paid with straw for corn, And fain to reap it with a scythe of fire. XLI. Lo, here comes farmer Nimrod, on his grey! Eager his victim's well-earn'd hate to brave, And proud to be a tyrant and a slave, He damns his feeders twenty times a day: “What right to think of his concerns have they?” Well can he bear the trader's land-made cares: “Happy the poor,” quoth he; “for thrive who may, A comfortable Workhouse still is theirs.” Yet swaps he not his happiness for ours! But in the page that lauds his right to wrong, Reads weekly, That Trade's gains to him belong; For what the country grows, the town devours! “He needs nor towns, nor trade! but traders eat; And they must pay his price! or he will grow no wheat.” XLII. All white below, and brightly blue above! A fitting temple for Eternal Love, December's World of snow and sky! art thou. The groinings of its roof no stone require; The spangles of its dome are worlds of fire; Its pillars are the Everlasting Now. Throned on his deeds, He reigns—by all beheld, By all obey'd; soul-felt, and soul-adored, And soul-proclaim'd; of Life and Death the Lord! I kneel to Him in reverence, not in fear; And on his forehead, easy to be spell'd, Read his great precept, “Let the soul be free.” Oh, God of Works! why should I worship here A god of words, when I can worship Thee? XLIII. With words for chains, in links of prose or rhyme, We proudly fix the Homeless in his place; Naming Eternity, we think of time; Naming Infinity, we think of space; Of the worm's path, whose crawlings we can trace On vast immutabilities of dust; The deathless monuments of human trust, Which passing hours, or moments, still efface. Proud of our foolscap, and its jangled bells; Blind to the All-Apparent, All-Unknown, Who tips with suns his spires and pinnacles; Our ignorance on our vanity we enthrone, And in a little chapel of our own Creep to the worship of dead syllables. XLIV. Blind leaders of the blind, by blindness led, Men say to God, and his Eternal Year, “Stop! it is finish'd! let your rushing skies Rein in their fiery steeds, and be at rest.” Yet do our altars stand, though built of sod! Then, scorn not Error. Dateless is the faction That, if they could, would bridle Mind's career, And eagerly erase the words of light O'er Truth's wide portals written to be read: “All things that are, or were, are thought in action, The testing of the Thinker's theories; And they who limit knowledge, do their best To stop, or hinder, Progress Infinite, The Wisdom and the Happiness of God!” XLV. The morning of the last day of the year Instructs me that my course is nearly run. I thank Thee that I see another sun, Father of Seasons! that I still am here To do thy will; and that the dawn is near Of a New Life for me. What have I won In worthy strife? What good work unbegun Awaits me? Father, I must soon appear Before Thee, to be sentenced. If I strove In kindness, I am safe. What is our own? That only which we build for Thee and thine. Who shall reap love, unless he sow in love? If I have labour'd for myself alone, I need no lock'd strong coffer: Nought is mine! XLVI. The evening of the Year's last day is come; And on pale Erin's face, (but not like one Who hath no hope,) with lingering gaze, the sun Looks, pausing still to look. There is no bloom On her closed lips, no passion on her brow; Yet never seem'd she beautiful as now! And pride and grandeur deepen in the gloom Which his large brow casts o'er her winding-sheet And lifeless locks. The blue sky is her tomb, The sea her bier. “We part,” he says, “to meet; Yet shalt thou live, and love, be bless'd, and bless; Yet shalt thou—holy, happy, changed—arise.” And he thanks God! with splendor-flashing eyes, And firier fervor in his thankfulness. XLVII. Night! starless Night! thick darkness, floor'd with snow! If this be death, the Soul of Things repairs, In death, the strength by which th' immortals reign, And suffering truth to be a martyr dares: If this be death, in death the mind prepares The growths of larger thought than yet hath been,— The unconceived, that shall be felt and seen, And bow the heav'ns, to lighten toil and pain: If this be death, through death to life we go! For what is death, but sleep in starless night? In sleep, the childless sees her son restored; In sleep, the widow clasps again her lord; And sleep gives blissful tears to hopeless woe: Then, why should Death the pillow'd soul affright? XLVIII. Answer me, Fear! Thou in the depths dost dwell In darkest depth; for light is dark to thee, And noon concealeth the dread Mystery Which men call nothingness, and fate, and hell. Profoundest Fear! who, closing thy wide eyes, Beholdest God! and two eternities! And shriek'st. “The One! The sole Infallible!” Brave Trembler! Thou, who seek'st, and fear'st to find, The Cause Uncaused of mindless things and mind, The Unapproach'd, Unsearchable, Alone! If pain thou know'st, if weakness knows thee well, And if thy weakness is unmeasured might, Answer me! Why should helpless Death affright The Lifter of the Veil of the Unknown? XLIX. What doth it cover? Mystery and Thee. Life Everlasting, and All-vital Sleep, That Mystery is, and evermore will be. Thou art all passions, all in one, dark Fear! All passions of all men, the bond and free, Whether they love, or hate, or laugh, or weep; For all would have, and all who have would keep. Then, lift the veil, and thy own features see Beneath it, thou strong servant of Love's might! Taught by the Progresser to show Man here God's face in goodness only, and the right; Reading his Name in darkness which is light; And ever summoning the infinite Of age-long moments, to complete his Year! L. And to the Father of Eternal days, And fairest things, that fairer yet will be, Shall I no song of adoration raise, While Passion's world, and Life's great agony, Are one dread hymn, dread Progresser! to Thee? Thou, Love, art Progress! And be thine the praise If I have ever loved thy voice divine, And o'er the sadness of my slander'd lays Flings its redeeming charm a note of thine. Oh, Gentlest Might Almighty! if of mine One strain shall live, let it thy impress bear; And please wherever humble virtues twine The rose and woodbine with the thorns of care, Thriving because they love! Thy temple, Lord, is there! After much theory, and some practice, I venture to propose the measure of this sonnet as a pattern to English sonnetteers; for while, to me, the Petrarchan, in our language, is at once, immelodious and inharmonious, the music of this, in its linked unity, is both sweet and various, and when closed by an alexandrine, majestic. BALLADS. ONE OF THE HOMES, A HEALTH OF TOWNS' BALLAD. The small boy, in his home of sighs, As if he hated man, Died, with raised hand, and open eyes, Frowning at little Ann. Then, died his bird: she wept, she sigh'd: 'Twas worn to skin and bone; But whether it of famine died, Or fever, is not known. She wept, but not for John—and yet She loved her brother well; She wept—wept for his little pet! But why she could not tell. Where frown'd its friend, his bird she put Within the coffin small; But then the lid refused to shut! She thought she heard him call! The dead hand propp'd the coffin-lid, Above the dreadful frown; It would keep up! it would, and did; The joiner screwed it down. And so, they slept in company; The blighted feather'd flower! And poor bud of humanity— Both blighted in one hour. Farewell, thou old street-shunning lane, Where John whole hours would stay, When welcomed flowers came back again, To welcome rainbow'd May! Flowers which by name he once could call! For he, with childish pride, Had kept, at home, a funeral Of flowers, that weekly died. His father, who loved wild flowers, too, Had taught the child their names, Though, with a florist's pride, he grew Outlandish flowers, in frames. Where lay the father on the floor, Was laid the coffin small; The mother lay behind the door, So, there were four in all; The blasted, black, once beauteous thorn, That never more would grow; The rose, once sweet as dewy morn; The blighted bud of woe; And, happiest there of all, the bird That ne'er saw God's bless'd sun, Or growing flower; ne'er saw, or heard, Tree wave, or river run. The rats peep'd out behind the door, And loth they seem'd to go; The rats jumped down beneath the floor, Into the sewer below. Men raised, in haste, the coffins three, In fearful haste were they: Ann, famish'd, follow'd gloomily, And heard the parson pray. Grey-hair'd he was, a grey-hair'd youth, Kind, humble, just, and wise; He look'd on woe-worn toil and truth With pity's tearful eyes; For he, a poor man's friendless son, Once suffer'd long distress, And hard up-hill his way had won To honour'd usefulness. His gown'd back to the wind he turn'd, And waved the holy book: On corpses three, by one child mourn'd He look'd, with solemn look: Behind him far, two youths well clad Stood mute, with ladies two: Before him gasp'd the bann'd and bad, A poor death-daring crew: One feebly clasp'd a dying child, Sobbing; another said, “Thank God for Plague!” and darkly smiled: A third said, “God is dead!” Their famine grinn'd—What could it less? Their sadness wore a frown; Their “loop'd and window'd raggedness” Blasphemed the parson's gown. But when that grey-hair'd pastor spoke, Their prostrate hearts arose, And trembling hope, like starlight, broke On each despairer's woes: “In life,” he said, “we are in death, Through death to life we rise: In fear man draws his fleeting breath, In sorrow lives and dies: We come like shadows—and are gone; Dust are we, dust to be; Until this mortal hath put on Its immortality.” DEVIL BYRON. A BALLAD. A strange man own'd yon Abbey once, Men call'd him Devil Byron; Yet he a sister had who loved Well that man of iron. And well he loved that sister—Love Is strong in rugged bosoms; Even as the barren-seeming bough Oft hoards richest blossoms. Yet from his heart, when she espoused A peasant, he dismissed her; And thenceforth Devil Byron spoke Never, to his sister. Therefore, whene'er he drove abroad, She chased the Man of iron, Rode by his wheels, and riding cried, “Speak to me, Lord Byron!” Thus, at his chariot's side, she pray'd; For was he not her brother? “Do speak to me, my lord!” she said; Was he not her brother? Her quivering hand, her voice, her looks, Might wring soft speech from iron; But he speaks not!—her heart will break: He is Devil Byron. Yet down his cheeks tears shoot, like hail; Then, speak, thou Angel's brother! Why struggle, in thy burning soul Wordless fire to smother? Oh, Power is cruel!—Wilful Man! Why kill thy helpless sister? Relent! repent! already, lo, Beauteous blight hath kiss'd her Men say, a spectre with thee walks, And will not from thee sever; A shadow—not, alas, thy own! Pointing at thee ever. Oh, think of Chaworth rashly slain, And wrath, too late repenting! Think of the kiss men give the dead! Vainly, then, relenting. Think of thy sister's mother's grave; Think of your days of childhood— The little hands in fondness join'd, Wandering through the wild-wood. The hedgerose, then, was not so fair As she, in gladness ranging; Now, sorrowful as beautiful! Changed, and sadly changing! The wither'd hand, the failing voice, Moved they the Man of iron? The live rose took the dead one's hue: God, forgive thee, Byron! As rainbow fades, she perish'd. Then, How fared the stubborn-hearted? With her, the wrong'd and lost, he lived— Never to be parted. The Abbot's garden well he liked, But there a shape was sighing; There, in each pale, reproachful flower, Sinless love seem'd dying. The bird that on the belfry wail'd, It all her tones did borrow; The shadows in his banquet-hall Wore her brow of sorrow. Where'er he went, she with him went— Alas, thou stubborn-hearted! The grey old Abbey's gloom did groan, “Life and Death, be parted!” He wish'd, but did not pray, for death— Pray, pray, thou Heart of iron! Dying he heard her heart's last pray'r, “Speak to me, Lord Byron!” Dying, he saw her dying face; And as with poison'd lashes, It look'd forgiveness, its slow smile, Smote him—He is ashes. Well sleep the dead: in holy ground Well sleeps the Heart of iron: The worm that pares his sister's cheek, What cares it for Byron? Yet when her night of death comes round, They ride and drive together, And ever when they drive and ride, Wilful is the weather. On mighty wings, in spectre coach, Fast speeds the Heart of iron; On spectre-steed, the spectre-dame— Side by side with Byron. The winds they blow rain, sleet, and snow To welcome Devil Byron; Through sleet and snow the hail doth go, Ripp'd—like shot of iron. A star? 'Tis gone. The moon? How fast She hurries through wild weather! The coach and steed chase moon and star, Lost and seen together. “Halloo!”—The slain hath left his grave! He knows thee, Heart of iron! And with a laugh that daft's hellfire, Hails thy sister, Byron! Which is most sad of saddest things. The laughter? or the weeping? Laughs Chaworth, while her Feast of Sighs Love-in-Death is keeping? Thou ghastly thing! thou mockery Of life, and human doings! With flame-like eyes, on shadows fix'd! Shadows which are ruins! Thou see'st but sadness in her smile, And pity in her sadness, And in her slander'd innocence Pain, that once was gladness. And can'st thou—while Night groans—do less Than weep for injured woman? Man! is thy manhood manliness? Is she not a woman? Oh, Night doth love her! oh, the clouds They do her form environ! The lightning weeps—it hears her sob, “Speak to me, Lord Byron!” On winds, on clouds, they ride, they drive— Oh, hark, thou Heart of iron! The thunder whispers mournfully, “Speak to her, Lord Byron!” My God! thy judgments dreadful are When thought its vengeance wreaketh, And mute reproach is agony: Now, thy thunder speaketh! He doth not speak! he cannot speak; Then, break, thou Heart of iron! It cannot break! it cannot break! I can weep for Byron. The uttered word is oft a sin, Its stain oft everlasting; But, oh, that saddest unsaid word; Its dumb guilt is blasting! Eternity, the ever young, Hath, with fix'd hand, recorded The speechless deed unspeakable; Ne'er to be unworded! Oh, write it, then, “in weeping blood,” Ye purified and thwarted! Oh, House of Brokenheartedness! Spare the broken-hearted. Tell not the fallen that they fell, The foil'd that there are winners, If He, whose name is Purity, Died, to ransom sinners. No, spare the wronger and the wrong'd, Oh, ye, who wrongs inherit! “A wounded spirit who can bear?” Soothe, the erring spirit! He, earning least, and taking most, May love the wrong in blindness, Not needing less, but all the more, Pity, help, and kindness. THE GIPSY. AN OLD LEGEND MODERNIZED. John Fowler, I owe you a tale or a song, I've remain'd, I confess it, your debtor too long; So, painting in verse and rude Saxon a scene Where oft with the bard of the rabble you've been, I daub on the landscape a figure or two, Not portraits from life, but ideally true, And humbly inscribe the poor picture to you. I. Said horse-swapping Jem, with his hat on his lap, While his bull-bitch sat listening near, “Was ever yet seen by a Stannington-Chap Stannington is a village near Sheffield. A contrast like this I see here? With Susan, my cousin, just four feet by two, Here's a gipsy as tall as a stee: Stee is the Yorkshire name for ladder. I guess, she is telling my fortune to Sue; And, I guess, we know what it will be.” II. With his legs on the turf, o'er his hat and his knees, Behind the bare brambles he bent, While Rivilin sang to the palm-waving breeze, Rivilin is one of the rivers of Hallamshire, near Sheffield, where the blossoms of the willow are called palms. A sweet ancient song about new-budded trees, As townward together the stream and the breeze Through regions of loveliness went; And he gazed, squatting low in the old birken wood, The venerable wood here alluded to was destroyed in the year 1837, to win a bit of wretched land, at twice the cost of its value. One of its old trees bore an uncouth likeness to three snakes twisted together, with their heads on the ground, and their tails in the air. With more pain than pleasure, I saw, about a year ago, in the Stove of the Sheffield Botanical Gardens, fragments of this tree. On the marble-fac'd prophetess brown, Whose eyes flash'd black venom where stately she stood, In her grey cloak and long sallow gown; For a chapter on gipsies, see William Howitt's Rural Life in England, which has furnished me with some particulars of this description. With her slightly arch'd nose, her smooth brow finely spread, Her chin sharply chisel'd, and bold Under lips of firm beauty, her face and her head Formed an oval of darkness and gold. Her hair was like horsehair, when glossy it lies On the strong stallion's neck, where the fledged linnet flies; And her black felted hat, suiting well with her size, Was a crown on the head of a queen; But 'twas strange! when he look'd on her face and wild eyes, Her eyes only seem'd to be seen. III. “What faults,” said the giantess, lifting her brow While a smile lit her loveliness grim, “What faults hath John Mathews, thy husband, that thou Would'st swap him for horse-swapping Jem?” IV. “I can't bear the sight of the flimsy old fool,” Black with rage, childless Susan replied, “While he bends o'er his books, like a sack on a stool, Fill'd with lumbering learning and pride. Is it my fault, or his with his tea-water blood, (In a Maltster a fault seldom seen,) That I'm talk'd of in scorn, under bonnet and hood Wherever big bellies convene? The lawyers want hanging. What right have old men To marry fair maids of eighteen? But he wheez'd, when he courted me, like a pipp'd hen, Such maggot's meat never was seen. This day is his birthday; he's fifty or more; How strong the changed villain appears! Oh, never was damsel so cheated before! And his folly grows green with his years. Of original sin, and the fruits of the fall, I hate the vile picture he paints: He hardly believes in the Devil at all! Then how can he trust in the saints? He pays to a Bookclub—When, when will it break? Its infidels fill me with fear!— He wastes in a newspaper fourpence a week, And in music five shillings a year. For what did I marry? The Wigtwizzle land Will go, when he dies, to Jem's Nan! His little gets less, like an used clew of band; I have neither won money nor man. The corn which he buys, goes as fast as it comes; He malts it, and sells it on trust; His customers schedule, while he sucks his thumbs, And thrive, while I pine on a crust. Every rogue knows Old Clever, whom babies deceive; He gets all, to risk all again! Oh, he'll make his old will, when he's nothing to leave! I may knit, but industry is vain. And he reads, ay, and writes, when his day's work is done, Bent double beside the great pan, While my cousin swaps horses, or fettles his gun, Fettled is an old Saxon word, signifying prepared. Thus, the Fettlers in an ironfoundry are preparers of the article for market. Or fights in the fair—like a man.” V. “A hard case indeed!”—in her ear-rings of gold, Blue-kerchief'd beneath hat and chin, Said the black-stocking'd sorner; and then slowly told Her charm of deep cunning and sin: “Thy husband bewitch'd shall, feet foremost, be borne To Bradfield, where slumber his sires, If thou, after tea, before ten in the morn, Wilt visit thy cousin, Jem Squires; And—nipping the thumb of his crippled left hand With the finger and thumb of thy right, Say, ‘Coffins mean Weddings! and, Jem, understand That Morning still follows the Night!’ But if thou, in him, ere the summer be o'er, A true loving husband wouldst find, Before thou go forth, let thy tyrant, once more, Hear a bit of thy long-troubled mind: And no one shall ask thee, ‘What did'st thou? or Why?’ Nor shalt thou be scared or ashamed; For ends may be ruled by the planets on high, And no honest woman be blamed.” VI. She said, and away, with a spring in her feet, (Erect, bony-ankled, and strong,) Departed, through gorse, blooming golden and sweet, While the lark sang his evening song. Jem laugh'd, but not loudly. How joyfully fast Through the wood of moss'd birches went Sue! And both reach'd their homes, ere the setting sun cast Bright gold on the cloud that from Stannington pass'd, And purple o'er Rivilin blue. VII. All night, she lay sleepless—or dreaming, all night, That a coffin a wedding implies!— John dream'd he had lost her! and wept with delight! But he waked, and saw rage in her eyes! With her hands on her hips, clad already, she seem'd Prepared, and determined for strife; For John was bewitch'd! and by all he was deem'd The plague of his plague of a wife. “Young wives and old husbands shall never agree,” Sigh'd Susan, repenting too late; “One side of a ladder is hardly a stee,” Sigh'd John, as he turn'd from his mate. Poor Henpeck! to please her all vainly he tried; For though quite an angel was she, He could not have pleased her, unless he had died, And no such intention had he. A spell was upon him—Yes, do what he might, His virtues were manifest crimes; He always did wrong, and she always did right! As she'd told him, some hundreds of times. VIII. Bright, bright shone the morning, when breakfast was done; But Sally, the maid, look'd with fear On Susan's broad face, that grew black in the sun— A sign that a tempest was near. The thrush sang without, where the gorse and the broom Wore their gold, near the overshot mill; And the birch was in bud, and the larch was in bloom, Beside the old farm on the hill; But, within, nought was heard save the sad undergrowl Of Susan, that lady of grief, While John turn'd his back on the wife of his soul, Pretending to read, and be deaf; Yet watching the storm, which he well knew would come, And lifting his left ear in pain, As he chuck'd the crack'd seal, with his finger and thumb, On the ring of his copper watch-chain; Or fast in his book turn'd the pages, unread; Or twisted its bit of red tape; Or pull'd to and fro the brown wig on his head, With its tail doubled up in his cape. Slow rising, at length—like Sir Graham in place, Or a broad-bottom'd Image of Fate; She stood—like Resolve, sworn to steal a watch-case, Or like a thick “pillar of state;” But soon on the floor stump'd her short flabby legs, Her broad face seem'd broader to grow, And then, as she spoke, she revolved on her pegs, Like a tub on one end turning slow. IX. “Now, Learned Old Fellow! I'll state thy true case: Oh, what a wrong'd woman am I! I'll leave thee, I'll get a good housekeeper's place— And do something else by and bye. This comes of your printing, and new-fangled schools; I'm driven from thy board, and thy bed; But if thou art wise, let me live with the fools, For they know how to butter their bread. Oh, if I'd an income, a home of my own, I'd ne'er look again on thy face; But my wrongs, Mister Intellect! all shall be known When I've got a good housekeeper's place. Then, bless'd with thy absence, and snug as a mouse, I'll pick with a friend a dry bone; For thy famous tup shins shall ne'er enter our house, Though I can't turn thee out of thy own. I read thee, Old Dog, and old Cain on thy brow! My pearls are but thrown unto swine: A pattern for servants to copy art thou; What manners, Old Beggar, are thine! Thy brothers were beggars—Thou Son of Old Spite! Will the brother of fools say, I lie? Thy parish-paid aunt was a threadbare Old Fright; Thy father was blind of an eye; Thy uncle's lean niece had a face like a fish; Her husband gave bail for two thieves; Thy cousin, blue Snob, was sold up, spoon and dish; Did he die in a shirt without sleeves? Thy sisters, they—Oh, not a breath can I fetch! Dog! my breathing—my breathing's so bad!— But it's well there's a madhouse, thou raving Old Wretch! Sarah! Sarah! the Fellow's gone mad!” X. But John kept his temper: “Do leave us, dear Sue! For I've long been the plague of thy life: Besides, I and Sally without thee can do; And Jem is in want of a wife.” XI. “Agreed!” with a shout answer'd Susan; and soon She complied with the despot's desire; For she roll'd out of door, like a lady balloon, Or a puncheon of brandy on fire. Bright red was her gown, green and yellow her shawl, Betassell'd and fringed to the knee; And a cloak of flower'd purple she flung over all; Oh, a regular tulip was she! Beneath her umbrella-like bonnet, put on With a town-knowing twitch of much grace, She seem'd like two fat tapster's-wives, join'd in one. And netted together with lace. In front, like a star, her broad quarters between, Shone her clasp of raised silver on steel; And she holds in one hand, that her wealth may be seen, Her boa and tippet of seal; While the other, muff'd richly, and cushion'd from cold, She waves, like a fan, as she goes, Both to show her gold watch, round her waist chain'd in gold, And cool the hot blood in her nose. And fast through the croft, where the crab blossom'd white, Scattering snow to the bilberry brake; Fast by the old stones, with grey lichens and light Speckled o'er, like the back of a snake; Fast down the steep hill, through the wild wizard wood, Fast over the river she hied; Then, climb'd to the nook, where her cousin's house stood, And met there—Himself and his Bride! A chaise at the gate, and a postboy she found; At their ribands she could not but stare, When he open'd the door, threw the steps to the ground— And out came the new-married pair! For Jem (Shabby Fellow!) had wedded his maid! Oh, Prophetess, deep was thy guile! And vulgar he look'd in his breeches of plaid, When thus spake the bride, with a smile: “Good Susan, we ask not, What dost thou? or why? Nor are we afraid or ashamed; For ends may be ruled by the planets on high, And no honest woman be blamed.” XII. “Did Sal stop the clock, from past five until seven?” Said Jem, with the look of a lamb; “By my wife's lever-watch it is now near eleven; There's treachery, certain I am.” XIII. For the first time in life Susan redden'd with shame, And out rush'd the bull-bitch, to see! But, broad as a cask, o'er the bitch roll'd the dame; Oh, a sadly changed lady was she! In dirt lay the tulip, red, purple, and green, With its stripes of bright yellow so fine! And truly she said, “I'm not fit to be seen,” While vainly Jem press'd her to dine. XIV. Back, down the long bank, full of wisdom, she went: Let none on that name cast a slur! She could not conceive what the vile gipsy meant, By supposing that Jem would suit her! He rode like a clown, in his coat or his cloak, And she loath'd his vile breeches of plaid: If he brought her tobacco, (she did sometimes smoke,) It was always in brandy o'erpaid. A nasty, colloguing, conspiring, lame cheat, One-handed, left-legg'd, and pig-eyed! She'd not cross her door sich a fellow to meet, Nor stand in the road by his side. She always knew well what his tendencies were; Oh, his tastes were all grovelling and base! And he might be a bastard! she'd scorn to appear Where a trull, like his wife, show'd her face. “Would I condescend,” said the dignified dame, “To touch sich a minx with the tongs? I better know how to preserve a good name, And what to good breeding belongs. A coarse tasteless tassel—a cheat, and no witch— What a vile tawdry dress she has on! But she'll keep his accounts—she can write; if he's rich, They'll shine, till his money is gone; And when it is gone he will rightly have learn'd What ladies who scribble can do; And wish all the books, but the Bible, were burn'd, And their readers, (or one of them,) too. I would not be spiteful, but; God mend them both! It's the worse wish I wish them, I'm sure; He's a good-for-nought, bandy-shank'd blackguard and sloth, And she quite as pretty as pure. I wish her no harm, with her blushes of brass; But she may have six twins in three years, And corrupt every farantly neighbour she has, Setting them and their wives by the ears. Poor Gudgeon! he's hook'd—by a child-bearing Pouse! But sluts are best married to rakes: May their pigs get the itch! and smoke stifle his house! And her oven spoil all that it bakes!” XV. But now she drew nigh to the river again, And the wood of moss'd birches so old; While black over Stanage, with hail and with rain, A tempest of April was roll'd: Right and left, like a shaft-broken arrow of doom, Unheard its red lightning was sent; And, Up! the broad curtain of fire-lifted gloom, From the summit, at intervals went: Like many-tail'd snakes, with their heads on the ground, And their many tails pendent in air, In skeleton grimness, the aged trees around, From the region of storms, and its black western mound, Lean'd motionless, silent, and bare; But her heart heard no voice, when the damp hollow wind Through their dry branches drearily moan'd; Nor felt she his touch, when it wetted each rind, And the fast-coming thunder-cloud groan'd. Like steel which (worm-red, and not glowing with flame,) In water skill'd artisans dip, Each big drop of rain seem'd to hiss as it came, And smoke on her hot under-lip: More black grew her choler, more gloomy the skies; Then, a blast shook the old wizard wood— Where, lo! the tall gipsy, with night in her eyes, In the glare of the lightning-flash stood; With night in her eyes, and the torrid sun's fire; With power in her mien and her form; Beautiful wildly—Like Love soothing Ire; Or light on the clouds of the storm; Or Knowledge, all calmly preparing the fall Of the crime-honour'd throne of the sword; Or Goodness, declaring through one unto all, That the Father of all is the Lord. As a poplar in summer, when gently the breeze Wakes its twiglets, with whisperings sweet, Amid the grey trunks of the hoar forest trees Looks down on a flower at his feet; So, a sable-hair'd child, with his eyes raised to hers, And his rose-lips half open to speak, And the bronze of the bloom of the rich mountain furze Turning brown on his soft yellow cheek; A child—her own miniature self—by the hand She held, looking down on his smile, With a fulness of love that no heart could withstand, Save the heart of low cunning and guile. For in her deep love there was sorrow as deep; Ev'n there, on the spot where she stood, (When the vale in October's dim mist lay asleep, And the moon only watch'd o'er the wood,) All silent, with none to assist or annoy, And in anguish too mighty for tears, She had buried a daughter—the twin of the boy That made her acquainted with fears; And while on the soul in his visage she gazed, She saw in her heart, the last look Of her lost second-born, with her wild eyes up raised, As her flight to the angels she took. But Susan saw nought in that beautiful child Akin to her own barren heart; No trust could his aspect, so trustfully wild, To her all-doubting bosom impart; She found in the might of the mother's dark face Only dark indications of crime; No grandeur, nor beauty! nor greatness, nor grace, In her action serene and sublime. She knew not that Love plants with roses the wind, And builds on the seas as they roll; That the waifs of the world can be gentle and kind, And the homeless find home in the soul; But kept the true faith, in her maxims, derived From progenitors growing in grace, And bred in-and-in, with the hornets they hived, Till perfection was stamp'd on their race. XVI. “Did I stop thy clock, from past five until seven?” Said the gipsy with ill-suppress'd laugh; “By Ecclesfield chimes it is long past eleven: Thou'rt too late, by an hour and a half.” XVII. “The Snake!” Susan cried, “there she hisses in scorn; The Pickpurse! she stole my crown-piece; The Rascal! I'll watch her; she means, I'll be sworn, To steal Tommy Somerset's geese. For who can be safe, when plain folks are ashamed To sign for their names with a cross? Our thieves, like Jem's Nan, for book-learning are famed; And learn'd is yon rogue, to my loss! No gipsy is she, but a thief from the town, Where she borrow'd her books, as she borrow'd her gown. But yonder's my John! he is waiting, I see, To welcome his glove of soft silk: Ev'n fools know the worth of a good wife, like me! So, I'll hasten—and skim him his milk.” XVIII. Then, she puff'd up the hill, to the home of her love; And there a strange scene was display'd; For John the bewitch'd, though expecting his dove, Sat at dinner, with Sarah, his maid, In the neat pannel'd parlour, where Jem used to dine, When he call'd on his way from the shows: He was sipping Jem's cordial, the dame's brandied wine, When Sarah in terror arose, And in came meek Susan! who said not a word, But threw her soil'd shawl o'er a chair; Then, courteously smil'd on her fear-feigning lord, And honour'd her maid with a stare. A hot roasted fowl on the table was placed; So, feeling of hunger the stings, She took Sarah's chair, and to show her good taste, Help'd herself to the breast and both wings. But in token of peace, both the sidebones for John, From under the straddle she carved; And gave him both drumsticks, when both thighs were gone, To feed the fat hen he had starved; For Susan transform'd by a spirit of power, Seem'd meek as a storm-cloud at rest; And John the Bewitch'd, Unbewitch'd from that hour, Was of maltsters and mortals the best! He spoke not, but placidly welcom'd the change Which Time, “that brings roses,” had brought; Nor tardy was she to give evidence strange That in her was a miracle wrought Lo, when she had dined, to the garden she went, Where she cull'd the first lilac of Spring, The prize-polyanthus, with violets blent, And primroses—tied in a string; And placed them—and laugh'd—on the cloth of pale blue, In a vase, sprigg'd with gold on dead white; For all that is lovely and tasteful, she knew, Fill'd his weak childish heart with delight. Sweet Flowers, how they smiled through the thunder's bright tears, On the maltster, self-scourged, though belied, Who shook in sly glee, the brown wig of his years, With the gipsy-changed dame at his side: “Young wives and old husbands may sometimes agree,” Said John, shaking hands with his mate; “A lobsided ladder's a sort of a stee,” Thought Susan, instructed, though late; While the Father of Love, from the brightening west Where Loxley and Rivilin rise, Cast down on their waters, awake or at rest, And on John's placid smile, and on Susan's fond breast, The soul-soothing blue of his eyes; And the redbreast peep'd in from the moss'd windowsill, Where he sang in the sunshiny rain, Till the thunder-rent cloud, o'er the rough eastern hill, Retiring in wrath, that spake thunder-toned still, Left Stanage, serene as his Maker's high will, In sunshine and glory again; Proclaiming afar, in the silence of light, His love of the lovely, the might of his might; Proclaiming afar, that the Beautiful lives With the good and the wise, in His Temple of Mind, Still making life's strength of the peace that he gives To the hearts of the gentle, the thoughtful, the kind. EPISTLE. Since Ellen Rendall deigns to say, “Write me a poem!” I obey. Weeds in exchange for flowers, I send; For the best letter ever penn'd, The best bad rhymes I can compose— Not strength in beauty, like thy prose; Oh, not the wealth of feeling fine Enriching every phrase of thine, The fresh fruit of a sad heart's truth, Flush'd over with the bloom of youth! Rhymed words I write, and fain would write A poem, with a poet's might. But I am bow'd with years; And cares that shed no tears, Bend me towards my kindred dust. When sorrows come, because they must, With lips of ice, and looks of clay, To turn the spirit's tresses grey; Can stooping age (though fain he would,) Write earnest thoughts in “weeping blood,” And o'er his winter spread the glow Of warm June's dewy roses? No. Who to the rain-cloud can restore The bow that “vanish'd in the storm”? The quench'd heart's fires return no more! But what I can I will perform. Long ere I read a thought of thine, I plann'd a lay, call'd Etheline; A lay that oft, in hope and joy, I may have ponder'd when a boy. Feebly commenced, and idly cast Aside, to be redeem'd at last, A thousand lines the song will end; A hundred are already penn'd. Lady! I will inscribe to thee A tale of Love and Jealousy, And old, old times—when life was young, And wisdom taught what passion sung. Thou, Ellen, thou shalt be my Muse! Power not his own the bard shall use; Thy young soul's beauty, wisdom, truth, Shall wake in me a dream of youth; As when a stripling, (skill'd to fling The glory of a seraph's wing O'er all the woful gloom and strife That dully chequer human life,) Placing, with careless grace and ease, The time-worn Harp before his knees, O'er funeral Autumn's pensive flowers A shower of splinter'd sunbeams showers, And charms the haunted region round With ecstacies of sight and sound; Or, in the soul its thunder waking, Kindles within the heart that's breaking Fire, born of darkness that weeps fire And thoughts that turn men pale, Bidding the fallen still aspire, Though still to fail; And like the Adwick of my strain, Each doom'd Prometheus smile at pain; Or, school'd his dire reward to meet, Die with sad pride, as Cæsar died At imaged Pompey's feet. ETHELINE. “Elyot the harper, would not worke; But at the great feast of King Murke Sung the warst lay that ever was: ‘Out of my sight, thou droning ass!’ Cried Murke, and to his feet upstarted: Whereat mine ancestor departed.” Morte d'Arthur. BOOK I. Dear Ellen Rendall! seers have said That of his realm of giant oak, O'er valley, plain, and mountain spread I am informed by a person learned in such matters, that the valley of Conisbro' near Doncaster was once a lake of considerable extent. Ere echo mock'd the woodman's stroke, Barbarian man the temple made, Where first Religion kneel'd and pray'd; The green cathedral of the soul Whose god was in the thunder's roll. 'Twas finely thought, and sagely, too; The beautiful is ever true. But I the temple dread would paint Where primal fraud was terror's saint. Thou Ellen, thy young grace and truth, May wake in me a dream of youth, But cannot sweep the mist away From hoar tradition's dateless day; And if no scene can now be found Which fancy might deem haunted ground How shall the Muse of bed-rid age Construct for Eld a hermitage, Where he may bend dejected o'er Old dust, whose history no man tells, And homes of glory now no more? His old eyes full of doubt, and dim With grief! his old beard jagg'd and torn, And hung with weeping icicles! The only old tree mocking him! The old rocks laughing him to scorn! And the old skies (with tears, at morn, Implored some little grace to show him,) Looking as if they did not know him! I. The west wind, gusting boldly, From Cadeby's falls sent far The roar of Don and Dar, Flooding with watery howl and groan, Their wild abyss of riven stone. After a day of rain, The setting sun shone coldly, Like one who smiles in pain, O'er woods that seem'd to floor the sky With ocean-like profundity; And on the lake's dark grey and blue The oaken towers of Konig threw A red and shatter'd glare. 'Twas then, that, in despair, A woman young and fair Paced the black water's eastern shore, And on her woful bosom bore Her child, asleep. She could not weep; The “countless laughter” of the lake, See a book called “A Monopolygraph, by Samuel Gower of Holmfirth,” full of noble poetry and sound criticism. I refer particularly to his translation of the Prometheus Bound. The line copied by me will be found in the following passage: Prometheus, (solus,) Oh, thou divine and boundless atmosphere! And you, ye swift-wing'd winds of heav'n, and thou, Oh, countless laughter of the salt sea waves! Like mockery on her senses brake. Because her heart was broken. She would have spoken Her deathful thought, But in her throat The strangled utterance died. She knew not that she tried in vain, With trembling lips, to speak her pain; Nor knew that, screen'd by willows grey, Beneath her, in its little bay, Sat giant Adwick in his boat, With lifted oars—prepared to pay A visit long delay'd. In silent pray'r, she pray'd; Then, looking, wildly looking On Konig's tower—nor longer brooking His cruelty and pride— Sprang over boat and willows Into the billows. Close to her breast the child was press'd, And down she went; but rose, at length, Relenting, and with desperate strength Cried, “Save lord Konig's child!” then, drank The wave, and sank. II. She sank—the baby floated, As if its life was boated. Swift Adwick soon the struggler caught, And almost touch'd the mother's hair, The sinking face of her despair. He placed the infant in the boat; Then, from its stooping side, Plunged deep beneath the tide; Rose, dived, and rose, to dive in vain; Yet lived to see that face again! Recovering soon his rocking boat, He sate awhile in painful thought: “Another victim! women run To Konig's lord, to be undone. If man may tempt them, Konig can; Ay, Konig is your woman's man.” Gently he laid upon his knee The frighted child, and wept to see Its helpless loveliness; Yet felt he not the less The promptings of an inward snake, To hate it for its father's sake. “I'll plague yon false betroth'd of mine;” (Grimly he spoke, and grimly smiled,) “I'll take the babe to Etheline; She loves the sire—why not the child?” III. Beside the grave, where evermore, Unknell'd, uncoffin'd, not unwept, Her widow'd mother slept, Beneath the copse of willows hoar, With dwarf ash mix'd, and crab, and sloe, And brambles for the gadding vine; Close to the deep lake's western shore, In restless mood, walk'd to and fro The orphan Etheline. Lone daughter of a wizard sire, (So, by her policy deceived, Men eagerly believed,) Fear'd was her power, and widely known: Her spells could rule the thunder-stone, That floods the heavens with fire; Her glance strike dead the secret foe Who but in thought might work her woe. A bow-shot from the roughen'd wave, Not ten yards from the copse and grave, Back'd westward by the boundless wood, Her moss'd and log-built cabin stood; And still beneath the copse she went, And enter'd oft the tenement, But could not there abide. She feign'd much wonder—“Why no more Came Adwick then, as heretofore, To lonely Waterside?” (Such was the name her dwelling bore,) And sometimes blush'd, (but not with shame,) For neither he nor Konig came. “Not that she cared for Konig. Why, Should lowly maiden look so high? Besides, of love he never spoke; Though oft he came, 'twas but to joke; And still he came, to go in haste; And weeks, since last he came, had pass'd. Then, why should Adwick knit his brow? Was Adwick jealous? Jealous! No; She'd scorn him, if he could be so.” IV. The stormy west was scowling, And wolves, far off, were howling. The starved she-fox, from Ravensly, Yelp'd o'er oak-waving Denaby. Deep in the wath of Addersmarsh, The bittern strain'd her trumpet harsh. The mast-fed boar had crunch'd his fill. Beneath the blast, increasing still, The ash-twigs snapp'd, aloft in air: Their fall disturb'd the drowsy bear, And every falling leaf the hare. “The coming night is glooming,” She said; “the night is coming; The direness of the bittern's booming Foretels a night of moan and groan— Here to be pass'd by one so lone! The night is coming.” What saw she westward of the grove? What look'd she north to see? A boat approaching? Did it move? It moved, it pass'd the wizard's tree; “He comes!” she said, “'tis he.” V. In haste, she strew'd her cottage floor With rushes, to the open door; Arranged the hearth, roused up the fire; Swept both her stools, and dress'd them both In covers of outlandish cloth, The work of mind-raised men and times; Brought by her grandsire's father's sire, (A merchant, known in many climes,) From Greece, his mother's grave. And that lone maid remember'd well Traditions (which she loved to tell,) Of old Judea's sacred sod, The altar of the living God; Of lands where written speech was known; And of her ancestor, the bard Renown'd, and to be famous long, Who many pains and dangers dared, And sang (where heroes thought in stone, And men were wise as brave,) The earliest written song. Unletter'd, not unwise, was he Whom now their daughter sate to see; An outlaw, learn'd in mystic lore, The worship of his sires of yore. How tardy seem'd his coming! “Hark! He moors,” she said, “his little bark;” And while she spoke, he stood before The seated maiden's open door: At once, homed sadness left her eye, Or feign'd a wondrous levity; As if a flower had long'd to die, And waked to laughter suddenly. VI. “What! come at last?” she said, and laugh'd, Each word a seeming-spiteful shaft; “Be seated, for I ne'er again Expected here my truant swain.” VII. Then, Adwick told, in mournful tone, (While on her lap he laid The rescued infant, still afraid,) How, crossing o'er the lake, He saved from death the little one; “And well,” said he, “I knew, If aught on earth were true, That thou would'st love it—for my sake.” VIII. “A pretty tale, no doubt, I hear; But why,” she said, with look austere, “Must I my rival's bantling rear?” IX. “Nay,” he replied, “no rival fear; For who its mother, Whether it sister have or brother, I nothing know; but this foretell,” (And as he spoke his raised brow fell,) “That thou wilt love the baby well.” X. “Hence with ye both!” she said, and frown'd, And almost wish'd her lover drown'd. But then the child Look'd up and smiled, Gazing on her with Konig's eyes: “Oh, leave her here! I'll take the child!” She cried, betray'd by her surprise; Then, feasted on its father's eyes Of deep, deep, darkest blue. XI. Passion! thou to thyself art true, And well dost all thou hast to do. Adwick beheld the sweet surprise With which she gazed on Konig's eyes In that poor infant's face. He did not fail to trace His rival's image there! With fiery scowl He stamp'd it on his soul. With sullen stare, He saw her kiss the foundling fair; And in the blood of deathless pain, Painted that picture on his brain. XII. She knew not what a change had come O'er Adwick's mind and heart; A cloud of grief and ire, Thence never to depart; A sorrow worse than dungeon-gloom, Or blackness of the coffin'd tomb; The tortured sleep, that ever wakes; A memory made of knotted snakes; With fire, for blood, in every vein, And cold, that burns like fire. The outlaw's heart was turn'd to stone; His all was gone. XIII. But ere he thence departed, She raised her head, and started His stricken form to see, Stiff in its agony. How like a pallid monument, The work of skill omnipotent, With cheeks of rock, and tresses rent, And forest-brows, o'er paleness bent, He stood, in silence pale! Or redden'd, like the crimson glow Of stormy morn o'er Stumperlow; Or Kinder, when, far seen, he stands, With lightnings flashing from his hands, Unheard, through rain and hail! And pity wrote, in sorrow's book, The story of his parting look. Silent, he sought his restless boat, And vanish'd, like a dreadful thought: Oh, hope destroy'd is man's undoing! Heav'n, save his mind from total ruin! Flinging from rapid oars the light, He tilted through the glooming night, And reach'd the cave (his living grave, And homeless home,) which ne'er again Shall know a joy unmix'd with pain, Though still around its door uncouth, The woodbine of the sunny south, Brought by the sires of Etheline From regions of the cluster'd vine, Shall hang its fragrant-finger'd flowers, To lure the bee from forest-bowers; And, rock-throned near, one vastest elm (Knot-wristed monarch of a realm All forest, cloud, and wave,) Spread o'er its lawn his sky of shade, Where ship-brought foeman never stray'd. Unseen, lord Konig, hidden nigh, Beheld him pass. “Wolves have their caves,” The chieftain said, “and there are graves For men whose kindred thrive; But here's a cave that is a grave, Where lives the dead alive.” With restless foot, and seeking eye, Impatiently, impatiently He waited near the shore For one whom he Again shall see, But to his heart clasp never more. “The clouds,” he said, “are gone to bed; How their dark chamber overhead Rocks! Will she come to-night? The wakeful hare hath roused the bear; The wild pig grunts, the pack'd wolf hunts; She will not come to-night.” XIV. He said, and vanish'd—not unheard, As near huge Adwick's cave he pass'd, And took his homeward way! How like the climber of the blast, The noiseless-wing'd, night-haunting bird, That, hunger-stung, and balk'd of prey, Flaps, in vext flight, the forest grey! XV. “That was not the roused bear's tread,” Frenzied Adwick, listening, said; “Nor the pack'd wolf's crowding rush; Nor my dreaming runlet's gush; Nor my night-dirge, in the bush; Nor my cloud-song overheard. Worse than wolf oft watcheth here; Worse than wolf inhabits near.” XVI. No limner was there, at his side, To paint his lip of grief and pride, The strife, where mind with madness strove; The war of misery and love; And check the pencill'd hand in fear, Starting, these wilder words to hear. XVII. “If I bid blind darkness sing Hymns of brightness; If I wield the thunder's wing, Plumed with brightness; Shall my mercy fail to smite Evil will? Shall my justice fail to kill Evil might?” XVIII. Mad, yet conscious of his madness, Long he paused—then spoke in sadness: “Ere the eyes of midnight beam'd; Ere red morning's banner stream'd; Ere the sun began his race, Silence, and the grave of death, Were my throne and dwelling-place; Yet I draw an outlaw's breath! Can I make the desert's tree Beautiful, and all for me? Or, to soothe another's woes, Out of nothing bring the rose? Yet—all shunn'd, and homed with pain,— Vainly love, and wildly fear, Vainly heave unceasing sighs, And from beauteous woman's eyes Vainly bid a pitying tear Drop, to cool my burning brain!” XIX. Then, weeping, started he, And spake aloud to vacancy: “Here again, thou King of Pain? Me, thy God, dost thou defy? Mocking still, thou strong in ill, Sneerest thou, Mine Enemy? Nought art thou, if not my slave. Yet thou biggen'st, like the grave To the sentenced felon's fears, When the ghastly verge he nears! Slave and Rebel! dost thou frown? Dost thou threaten? Thou dost well: I will dash thine altars down, Shake thee from thy horrid throne, Stamp thee back to hell. But what beauteous form and face Fold'st thou in thy vast embrace? Let me look upon the face Folded in thy dread embrace: Oh, those locks—those lips of snow, Eyes of death, and cheeks of woe, Freeze me into stone!” XX. But, soon, his grief was lost in ire, That purpled his worn cheek. Clench'd were his hands, his lips compress'd, A life of wrongs groan'd in his breast, Eager, in deeds, to speak; Like conflagration, smouldering long Ere flames the strength that mocks the strong, When up the red Niagara raves, And rafters swim on fiery waves, And night glares red o'er burning graves, And streets of roofs expire. BOOK II. Go, Ellen, visit Conisbro' When gusty Autumn's wildest day To the grey ruin's age and woe Shall wild and fitting homage pay. Then shall his shadow in the sun Make stormy sunshine doubly fair; Beneath shall wail the flooded Dun; And Music's Muse shall meet thee there. Start not Eliza's form to see That castled mound's brown shades among; But bless the dead maid's melody, Nor marvel if “her speech is song.” To die is but to put off sin, As morn puts off night's vapour foul; The dead are learners, who begin To sing the music of the soul. They teach the born-in-heav'n to feel How angel-voiced are human woes; And tempt the heavenly-born to steal From earth, the smile of sorrow's rose. Oh, beautiful in tears, to them Who know not grief, that flower may seem, Reflected on its thorny stem, In mortal life's impassion'd stream! I. Lone darkness lit her lamps on high, Star waking star o'er all the sky; And Mercy from his throne divine Watch'd over sleeping Etheline. She slept, and with her slept The baby on her breast. Sleeping, she wept In dreams, for Adwick—and his woes; (Oh, if she loved another, So sister loveth brother!) And not from bless'd repose, But sorrowful unrest, She waked, to hear, around her ringing, Sounds, sweet as of an angel singing, When, thus, a voice like woman's sung, With more than music on her tongue. II. “Under the willow tree All that can die of me Perishing lies; There, in green water-brakes Royally—water-snakes Feast on my eyes. Then, if thou lovest him too; If I to him am true, Laid with the dead; If—as the true should be— Telma is loved by thee, In her cold bed; If all our acts are seeds— If good and evil deeds Never can die; If what thou oft hast told Me of the prophets old, Was not a lie; If the God-written speech Shall to the nations teach Life undepraved; If, sunk in sin and night, Worlds shall rejoice in light, By a child saved; If sinless might is thine— Motherless Etheline, Cherish my child! Orphan'd one, Lonely one, Pity my only one, Mother my child! Though born to singleness, Thou must live husbandless, Why live alone? She can secure to thee Wifehood's virginity; Make her thy own! She can preserve the soul, She keep the conscience whole; Mother her well! Him her pure love may save Ev'n from the spirit's grave; Snatch'd from deep hell! Me, all my sins forgiven, He may uplift to heav'n, Wing'd at his side; Cherubim, seraphim, Singing, to welcome him Home, with his bride.” III. The wild song ceased; and with a scream, Upraised in bed, the maiden said, “Could she be here? I do not dream. Where art thou? thou who sung'st so well! My Telma! Friend, loved long and well! Answer me! Oh, Beautiful and Terrible! Answer me! Why hast thou absent been so long? I know, my envy did thee wrong; But I have miss'd thee, yearn'd for thee. Beloved and Dreadful! let me see Thy visage pale! and tell to me Thy dreadful tale.” IV. No voice replies. Nor form, nor face, In glittering twilight, can she trace. In vain, she seeks repose; In vain, her eyelids close: Sleepless, she tosses, till the grey Of morning brightens into day. V. Day follows day, and Etheline Is happier than a bride; Still nursing little Telmarine At lonely Waterside. Them madness guards, and watches well, With vigilance invincible; And he may yet on man depend, Whom madness watches, as a friend. VI. Week follows week; and unseen hands For Etheline wild berries bring, Pure water from the living spring, And fire-wood from the shore; Kind whisperings reach her listening ear; Unseen, a kind shape near her stands; And friendly feet are wandering near, Though Konig comes no more. Yet Adwick loves not Telmarine! Her sire is loved by Etheline, And Adwick hates that sire! The man is mad. A cruel thought, And half-form'd dark intentions float Within his brain of fire. The wretch is mad—oppress'd—reviled: God! will he kill the rescued child? VII. But Konig comes to Waterside! He seeks, at length, lost Telma there; And saith, (his calmness is despair,) “The lost may with her rival bide; For after anger, love is sweet; And friends long-parted long to meet.” The self-caught trapper rues the hour When first he tried his cruel power (Oh, heartless deed!) to undermine The virgin name of Etheline, And do an orphan wrong. His shaft is shot, and ill it sped; For she loves him, and he the dead! Defeated is the strong. Lo, at her cottage-door they stand! She deeply moved, Yet coldly meeting her beloved; He, with feign'd gladness, courteously Pressing her small unoffer'd hand; And watching on the shadow'd sand, His form of loftiest majesty. The scarcely-welcomed welcome guest Enters her home, with heart depress'd; Around he pries, with cunning eyes, But finds not what he seeks; Then, pausing, speaks. VIII. “Daughter of merchant strangers! thou Endanger'd art, and lonely now. Within a bow-shot of my tower, I have a shelter'd plot and bower; There dwell thou safe, my queen and guest; This I, who might command, request. For who seeks now thy dwelling lonely? Fish-eating, hare-fed Adwick only— A headlong, blaze-brain'd, wisdom-troubling Fool, with new good old evils doubling; And thou, by shielding that doom'd man, Incurr'st the King-Priest's deadly ban. Well saith the saw of ancient date, ‘The empty friend devours his mate:’ Shun, then, th' accursed, or share his fate. Is it because his savaged brow Darkens a rebel's lip below, While sun-tann'd hide, and storm-comb'd hair, (Fit raiment both, for wolf and bear,) Clothe broadest breast, and largest limb, That maidens run such risks for him?” IX. He said, and from his forehead fair Stroked back dark locks of glossy hair, Smiling in scorn. She wrongly deem'd That he was tranquil as he seem'd, And, cautious, answer'd—boastfully Feigning a false security: “If we have caused his many sorrows, Shall I hate him who suffers for us? My father loved the outcast man Whom priest and priestling therefore ban, For well they know that Adwick knows How vain are all their shams and shows! But though the power that awes ev'n thee Might well appal a maid like me, I go not hence, Sir. Who will dare To storm th' enchantress in her lair? Weird daughter of a wizard sire, Can I not flood the heav'ns with fire? And slay, far off, the covert foe Who but in thought might work me woe? Nor force nor fraud of man I fear; Nor, Konig, am I lonely here.” X. “Not lonely here?” confused, he said; And from his lip its colour fled, When, at her feet, he saw a child, The little foundling, Telmarine. With Telma's smile, on him it smiled, With Telma's locks of raven hue, And upturn'd eyes of darkest blue. Confused, he named its mother's name! While pale, as death's cold brow, became The cheek of Etheline. XI. “Telma!” he said; nor waited long Ere seem'd at once to come and go The shadow of a shape of woe, (Like the last look of kindness sent From dying eyes, it came and went,) And, thus, a voice replied in song: “Oh, Konig, if the living knew, What death-freed spirits only know, That none are happy, but the true; Wert thou like moonlight on the snow, Or dew on lilies—bright and pure; Oh, if thy soul were anchor'd sure— Not on thy gods of death and strife, Fierce Jove, arm'd Pallas, fiery Mars, (Nor on glad Orus, and the stars, Or Jareeha, hurrying white Behind the troubled gloom of night,) But on the Lord of Love and Life; Thou would'st not need to hear it said, That bless'd are they who love the dead. Who that hath loved, as truth doth love, Loved only once, and lost his love, But in his heart of hearts hath said, “Safe is the love that loves the dead?” Then, Come! our marriage-feast is spread; Celestial guests inquire for thee; Sweet is the love that loves the dead! And angels wait for thee and me: Be happy yet! espouse the dead: Safe is the love that loves the dead! Oh, well is he who weds the dead!” XII. When ceased that voice “whose speech was song,” Still Konig fondly listen'd long. “Thou art not here?” at length, he cried, “Thou trouble-tried, and purified! Thy voice I heard, but where art thou? Oh, let me see thee! see thee now! Yet, ere this fever'd dream is o'er, Let me embrace thee!—once, once more!” XIII. Then, said the voice “whose speech was song,” “If thou would'st see me yet again Where human weakness dwells with pain, Go, follow him, whose eyes of hate Have watch'd thee early, watch'd thee late, And been thy watchers long. He comes, in frenzied passion strong: I see his dreadful scowl: If ought on earth is sad or foul, Behold it—in a ruin'd soul! Look on the havock thou hast made! On Adwick look! destroy'd, betray'd! Thou did'st not smite him with thy hand; The smitten might such blow withstand: Behold him—Lost! in spirit blind! Thy guilty heart hath slain his mind.” XIV. Lo, while he listen'd, Adwick came! Bare were his limbs, his breast was bare. Blue glitter'd through his matted hair His pain-changed eyes of ghastly flame, As if a wintry tempest threw Cold lightning on their freezing blue; And these wild words he utter'd there: “The crow doth croak. What croaketh he? ‘Dead horse! dead horse!’ Where may it be? At Cadeby-Force it lies a corse, And there a dead maid, near the horse. The lean crow croak'd, ‘At Cadeby-Force I come to feed, dead horse, dead horse! Oh, won't I feed at Cadeby-Force, Where lies, with thee, the maiden's corse?’ ‘Be mine, dead maid,’ the starved crow pray'd, ‘At Cadeby-Force, be mine, dead horse!’ ‘Nay,’ saith the worm, ‘be ours, dead maid!’ She shall—but not at Cadeby-Force.” XV. Brighter the maniac's eyes became; Speech, mix'd with laughter, from him brake; On Konig glared the eyes of flame; And, thus, to Konig Adwick spake: “Fish-eating Adwick, in the lake Hath caught a curious lady-fish: I caught it, Konig, for thy sake, And thine shall be the fish. Would'st see again thy loved one's face? Then, must thou see my lady-fish: Come! I will lead thee to the place Where thou may'st see my fish.” XVI. “Follow me, Lord!” he yell'd aloud; And Konig, fearless, follow'd him, Entering the forest's mazes dim, In sadness bow'd. They traversed realms of verdant night, And many a treeless isle of light, Whose peaceful bliss the eyes of Love Watch'd fondly through the blue above; A wilderness of shaded flowers; A wilderness of virgin-bowers; Of beauty (calm, not passionless,) And lonely song, a wilderness; For on, on, far and long, they went Through paths of green bewilderment, Where oft the ouzle, perch'd on high, Beneath his clouds, above his woods, Pour'd his full notes in gushing floods, Flattering the wood rill tunefully; Then, listen'd to its still reply, In all a bard's regality, And seem'd sole lord of earth and sky. Soul-meekening sadness sweetly crept The region o'er—and Konig wept: His sighs to echoes soft replied; He knew not why—but still he sigh'd. They reach'd at last the mount where stood The Father of the boundless wood, An oak, before whose vastness man, Dwarf'd to a gnat's dimensions, shrunk. Twelve full-sized men had fail'd to span, With outstretch'd arms, his giant trunk. One mighty limb, extended forth, Might have a war-ship's frame supplied; One shoulder, twisted to the north, A thousand winters had defied; (All eldest things had even told The hoary ages, as they roll'd, That he alone on earth was old;) And still the knotted hands prepared Their time-tried wrists and knuckles bared, The storms of centuries to dare. The tree was call'd the Wizard's chair; And in his hollow trunk the gloom Reveal'd an uncouth banquet-room: Perchance, in after ages dined In such a tree stout Robin Hood, Amid the depths of Barnesdale Wood Feasting his men on hart and hind. “Here enter!” growl'd the maniac grim; And Konig enter'd—following him Into the god-made forest-hall, With the mute step of funeral. Slowly undarken'd then the gloom. They stood within a living tomb, Before a form—a lifeless one— Whose lifted head long hair had on; Black, it descended like a veil, Half hiding features fix'd and pale; The light, if light it were, of eyes; And the still shape of lifeless thighs. Alone unclothed by that sad vest Were two fair shoulders, one round breast, Snow-sculptured legs, with small thin feet, White as a winding sheet, Or stainless ivory; And fingers, taper'd slenderly, Which—when the fond enamour'd breeze Pulsed gently through surrounding trees— Seem'd dallying with the long loose hair. Erect, as if she stood in pray'r, The beauteous Horror glimmer'd there! “How dost thou like her?” whisper'd then The seeming cruelest of men: One groan replied! a low dull sound Follow'd; and on the ground, At Adwick's feet, lord Konig lay Blackening, and senseless as the clay. XVII. “Dog! that fear'st bones!” said Adwick. “Thou Shalt do the outcast's bidding now. Who now shall say to Adwick, ‘Stand Apart from blessing! let no hand Touch him or his! no living thing Approach his withering?’ Soon, all shall know me. Heav'n is mine! The priests are mine, their altars mine, To work for good, not ill: Their sov'reign shall be Telmarine, And she shall do my will; For earth and heav'n are mine. Am I not God? Sweet Etheline Shall be God's God! heav'n's queen and mine. I am of Kings the King. Deny'st thou this, mine enemy? Ha!—shape abhorr'd! lord Konig's Lord! Laugh'st thou in hell-black mockery? Laugh—but the mercy of my might Shall smite thy blackness into light; Frown—Ay, with thunder bridge thine eyes, Swell, if thou wilt, to mountain-size, And with a look eclipse the skies! But—Ah! again? What form, what face Fold'st thou within thy vast embrace? Oh, those dear locks! those lips of snow, Those eyes of death, and cheeks of woe! They freeze me into stone! Yet triumph not, All-evil Thing! The king of priests, and thou his king, And all your instruments of ill, Shall do my will, And work for good alone.” XVIII. In envy, hatred, jealousy, In sorrowing pride's intensity, (Worst madness of worst misery,) On fearful thoughts his spirit feasts; And he will seek the King of Priests, Though doom'd to die, if he draw nigh The hallow'd kernel of the wood, His dwelling long ago; Where Mystery, fed on “weeping blood,” Is restless as a wintry flood, And cold as mountain-snow; Restless as fire! yet still unchanged; Or as the changeful, never changed, Unalterable sky! BOOK III. O'er “Wharncliffe of the Demons” thou, Dear Ellen, hast a wanderer been: Thy second letter places now Before my soul the beauteous scene. But thou hast named a name that brings Back the deplored and hopeless past, And o'er remember'd Wharncliffe flings An angel's shadow, flitting fast. Why did'st thou name that mournful name? Beautiful in its worth and woe, Over my sadden'd heart it came, Like funeral music, wailing low; Or like a deep cathedral toll, At midnight swung o'er Witham's wave, Proclaiming that a weary soul Had cast his staff into the grave. Oh, never more will Lycid see That relic of the forest old Which spread, “like an eternity,” Its green night over plain and wold; Grey Wharncliffe, and the oaks, that stand Like spectres of their sires sublime; Yet how unlike, though old and grand, Those giants of the olden time! Symbols of age-long funerals, They frown'd o'er fear's suspended breath, And pillar'd in their living halls The deathless might of mental death. Oh, Superstition! cruel, blind, False, restless, fair, as ocean's foam, How shall I paint, where shall I find, Save in man's darkness, thy dark home? I. While to the she-wolf from afar Her prowling mate replied, And muffled moon, and riddled star, Glimpsed on the dusk lake's mirror wide; Asleep, and dreaming, Etheline Rock'd on her bosom Telmarine, At lonest Waterside. Spirit of all that lives to die! Relate her dream of agony. She thought, a shape of darkness bow'd Heav'n's concave, crushing in her breath, As with the weight of cloud on cloud To rock-like substance press'd; And two pale arms snatch'd from her breast Her nursling, while it slept. She gasp'd, she wept; But grief was deafen'd in her soul By thunders, which then o'er her roll'd, And would, she thought, for ever roll Beneath the grave of death, When suns in death were cold. Then, did a realm of frost, A cloud-homed desert without shore, Receive her; and for ever lost With tears for light, her only light, Stone-still, she stood before Featureless Night. No sound was there, no flutter'd wing, No leaf, no form, no living thing, No beating heart, but hers—no air; But cold that pierced the soul was there, And horror which no tongue can tell, And silence insupportable: 'Twas depth unplumb'd, 'twas gloom untrod, 'Twas shuddering thought alone with God. II. Ev'n while she dream'd, in silence pass'd, Moon-lighted gloomily, A wanderer through the forest vast, Unto the Throne of Mystery Bearing a child, That gazed around her in surprise, Or innocently smiled, Looking on him, with Konig's eyes Of deep, deep, darkest blue, Almost to blackness deepen'd, yet Blue as Carpathia's violet. But soon in fear her arms she threw Around his neck; for the dim light Made darkness touchable to sight; Nor darkness only. Through the dusk Fierce shadows moved; from fierce eyes came Quick sparks of living flame; Hot pantings gather'd, thicker; then, a husk Of sound was heard—nor bark, nor growl— Which sometimes swell'd into a howl; And still, to hunger's instinct true, Nearer the dog of forests drew. Nought fear'd the Wanderer of the Night, Whose brow of gloom, And ghastness in the shadow'd light, Scarce seem'd of earth, or heav'n or hell; He, unconvinceable, Could not have trembled, if, o'er head, The desolated heav'ns had fled, While crash'd the trump of doom. But, lo, a flash, a glare, a blaze, Illumed the wood with ghastly rays, Suddenly! And the gaunt prowlers, balk'd of prey, Stopp'd, whined, crouch'd low, and skulk'd away. The wanderer sought a temple grand; Behold! its portal was at hand, The vast cathedral's forest-porch; Through which stream'd light from many a torch, Rays many-colour'd, piercing far The chaster light of moon and star, Beneath the wood-rill's canopy; And, lo, at once, the eastern aisle, In length a gloom-foreshorten'd mile, Reveal'd its groin'd immensity! So, when, at midnight, thunders roll O'er lone Roch Abbey's ruin'd fane, The dead walls, in the lightning's blaze, To God within the listening soul Chaunt old Religion's hymn of praise; Pillar and arch, in darkness hidden, Start up to sight, like things forbidden; And buried ages live again. “Pretty!” the child, delighted, cried, And clapp'd her hands; for she espied Five coming shapes, each bearing high A staff-raised brand of red, blue, green, Purple, and golden fire; which cast, As slowly they came nigh, On living buttress vast, And cloudy shapes between, And arch sublime, and tracery, Not wrought by man, commingled hues— Lovely as emerald ocean's foam Beneath an April sky; Disclosing lone side avenues, And domes which seem'd to come and go, Dome after dome, dome after dome, While shaft by shaft advanc'd, withdrew Like giants countermarching slow. Grim were the four—coal-black their vests, Their helms, and crests— Who bore the red, green, yellow, blue Torches; but robed in purest white, A female form of stateliest height, And fair to view As love and truth, Was she who bore the purple light: Her locks of snow, In amplest flow Descending to her feet, Cover'd her, like a sheet; And in her stedfast eye And sculptured look, eternity Seem'd wedded to immortal youth. Sudden, she stopp'd. Around her closed The sable four; their torches raised, Each touching hers, united blazed, And, lo, the cluster'd five composed A many-colour'd flower of flame, Beautiful, beautiful, As that bright rose which dark maids cull Where himalayan summits tower O'er fiery plain, and fiery flower! Then, from the unnumber'd voices came, Wailing the forest-depths among, Unearthly notes of chaunted song, Wild, mournful, grand; as shipwreck's cry, Heard through the groan of sea and sky, Convulsed in boundless agony; And like a yell of mockery, Forestalling worth's reward of pain, With the laugh'd lie That virtue toils in vain. Thus, sang, unseen, deep shades among, The singers of inhuman song: “When did the wisdom of the wise Expunge from life one human ill? Ever the Seeker's victories Leave his hard heart unconquer'd still: Therefore the gods the wretch deride Whose soul on truths forbidden feeds; And crush the atheist in his pride, (Cold, good-pretending deicide!) Who turns life's fairy flowers to weeds. Gods! curse him wet; Gods! curse him dry; Where fin can swim or foot repair! In light and darkness, cold and heat! Curse him wherever wing can fly! Curse him wherever heart can beat! And blast him with his granted pray'r!” III. The dread chaunt ceased, and over all, Except the Wanderer and the child, Strange awe, like death-bed fear, did fall, Or sleep, that dreams of woe. On came the Wanderer, unaffrighted; And while the valiant child, delighted, Listen'd or clapp'd her hands and smiled, He stood before the Nun of Snow. IV. “Fear not, thou Wanderer sad,” she said, “To follow whither I must lead: The pray'r is pray'd, the rede is read; And ever best the boldest speed. Well hast thou done th' appointed deed: Full well the chasten'd understand That they are govern'd who command: And long, oh, Wanderer sad, have we Expected thee.” V. “Fear?” he replied—and huger grew His vastness, where on her he threw A wondering glance; “Ye do my will, And but my purpose here fulfil. Proceed ye on your destined way, Obeying Him, whom all obey.” VI. Then, westward turn'd the sable four; The stately whiteness westward turn'd; Them following, he the nursling bore; And, raised aloft, the torches burn'd. How strangely, pillars vast On each hand pass'd! How grandly, overhead, Domes, following domes, behind them fled, All in deep silence! Silence deep Lay on the fretted roof, like sleep; And there the moonlight lay, like death; It could not pierce the gloom beneath, Where a broad orb, beheld afar, Shone westward, like a crimson star, And other light was none; Save of the torches red, green, blue, Purple, and golden. Round they threw Their intermingled ghastness wild, While laugh'd with joy th' undaunted child; But when he reach'd, with soundless feet, The Presence, and the Judgment-Seat, Torches and bearers all were gone! Then paused the Wanderer. North and south, He look'd on aisles of age-long growth, Tree-pillar'd high, branch-arch'd, star-proof, Cut short in darkness. Where he stood Within the kernel of the wood, The central vastness stretch'd out wide Its space sublime and sanctified; Of such a temple fitting choir; Worthy of its eternal roof, The bright, blue, moon'd, and starry sky, That domed its dread tranquillity, Commanding leaf and flower to grow In sad and silvery light below; For such a choir meet canopy. Before him glared the globe of fire, Scattering innocuous blaze and spark; And all beneath was dark; Save that the Wanderer might espy, Beneath the globe of flame, A pallid brow, a glittering eye, That slowly went and came. “Say,” spake a voice of deepest tone, “What man art thou—of men alone— Who dar'st the shadow of the throne?” “Mine is the shadow, mine the throne,” The Wanderer cried; “I therefore dare The shadow of the throne; For I am He who sits thereon, In spirit, everywhere; God! I am God! the all-adored! The many-named! the only Lord! Incarnate oft in human form; Permitting fear to worship love, On altar-stone, in hallow'd grove, And proud to bless the meanest worm, Though throned o'er earth, and sea, and sky; My chariot Light, my torch-stand Night; My sceptre Life; my falchion Pain; With dateless Thought for my domain, And Darkness for my canopy.” VIII. Beneath the globe of restless flame, Indignant features went and came; The pale brow blacken'd, the fierce eye, Gathering its thunder gloomily, Flash'd curses. Then, a voice austere, In accents mix'd of scorn and fear, Said, “Well, Sir God! what would'st thou here?” IX. The Wanderer answer'd, “I to thee Consign the Maid of Destiny, This sin-born child; for 'tis my will, That vice which blights, and crimes that kill, And pain, of evil born, shall bring Blessings to every living thing; And that all wrong, by love withstood, Shall turn all evil into good.” X. But woe-tried men have feelings fine; And loth was Adwick to resign The nursling, at his journey's end; As loth was she to quit her friend. Friend? Ay, she knew his troubled brow; Had heard him oft, in dreams, complain; By stealth, had watch'd his sleep; and now She clung to him, and kiss'd his cheek. Was he, then, loved? Lived he, to find, At last, that one of human kind Loved the foredoom'd to crime and pain? Almost his sanity return'd; He wept, as if his heart would break; Wept, but his tears were hot—they burn'd The brain from which they rush'd: So, lightning, when roused ocean raves, Harrows black midnight's clouds and waves, Together crush'd. Irresolute, and with smother'd sighs, He held her up: she turn'd, and smiled A smile that thrill'd him through, Looking on him with Konig's eyes Of deep, deep, darkest blue, Black almost, and yet throwing back The crimson of the pansy's black. But while he stood in dubious mood, Two arms, stretch'd forth, received the child. “Thus,” said the voice of deepest tone, “While men, on unfoundation'd thought, Build roofless deeds, which come to nought, The gods preserve their own: The sought is found, the promised maid, Ordain'd to save their cause betray'd; A chieftain's daughter, sin-begot, Brought by a traitor, trusted not.” XI. Ceased the fang'd voice. The murderous eye, The globe of crimson fire, were gone; And from the sky—how silvery, How cold o'er all, how suddenly— Moonlight and starlight, silent shone! The Wanderer wept—he was alone. Not so? From choral voice and gong, And trumpet, blown deep shades among, Arose a storm of sound and song: “The sought is found! and summons thee To doom and darkness, Heresy!” Brief, sudden, loud, As thunder from a rainless cloud, While shudder'd man and beast, It rose, and ceased. The Urus, in his reedy vale, Heard it, and rear'd erect his tail; Upstarted, in her fern, the hare; Upstood, with lifted paws, the bear; His wide-branch'd head The huge elk raised, and sobb'd in dread; Disturb'd, the wild pig grunted, The she-fox growl'd; In chorus stern, the pack'd wolf howl'd; Fast fled the prey he hunted: So, fear waked fear; o'er plain and hill, And rock, and tree, Th' affrighted circle widen'd still; Kinder and Deadedge heard the sound, Their tempest-pastured mountains round Trembling in sympathy; While echo smother'd groan on groan O'er cragg'd hag-ridden Edlington. BOOK IV. Ellen! “the dead are safe,” I said; Yet to the unreturning dead I must again sad utterance give: My pleasing task will then be done; Soon, then, my mortal course be run; And I, too, shall begin to live. Who shall undo the past day's deed? It labours for the coming hour; And if I am but as a weed, The weed, though dead, is still a power; Ay, and of Goodness! of all powers Greatest, the Life that cannot die, The evergrowing Unity, Whose death-matured and brightest flowers Will not the tiny soul contemn That bloom'd its best, and went to them! The perfect joy, that once was grief, Will see no sorrow in my leaf. Freed worms, that blamed a worm's excess, Will pardon kindred littleness. The left-on-earth will cease to blame Mistaken words, or failing aim; Nor scorn, perchance, from Shirecliff's side To gaze, with me, o'er Hallam wide; Or wander with a child of sin By shadow-haunted Rivilin; Or, loved of sunbeams! talk with one Whose soul, by Rother, Sheaf, or Don Still lingering, wreaths for truth will weave; And all that spirits tell believe. I. Oh, hast thou seen the mountain snow Which south winds softly overblow, How fast it wastes, how swiftly hastes To feed the rock-rill's lonely flow, And swell a sea of tears below? So wastes, so weeps lone Etheline, For she hath lost her Telmarine. In evil hour, an awful power Hath stol'n Lord Konig's child; And never since that dismal hour Hath she, the maiden-mother, smiled. Seldom she sleeps, But always weeps; And when she sleeps, she dreams That Telmarine, with joyful screams, Returns, to sport upon her breast, And laugh her into rest: Starting, she wakes! illusion flies; And back come dire realities. Then, to the silent gloom she sighs, And asks the silent gloom in vain, “When will my child come back again?” If in the commencement of this book, I have imitated one of the masterpieces of the age, the Mariana of Tennyson, (as at the close of the third, one of the finest passages in Scott,) I have done so, because I could not help it. I am aware that an original conception cannot be appropriated by any thief, however dexterous. “But many minds may gird their brows with beams. Though one did throw the fire.” II. In solitude, yet not alone, She lived, with nought to do but weep: Oh, better had she been a stone O'er whose old age old mosses creep! For emerald shadows with them dwell, And lonely sunbeams love them well. Ever, “My child! my child!” she said, And loathed her food, her hearth, her bed; And could not bear to keep Within her cot, by day or night; But, like a cloud that cannot sleep, Abroad, with darkness dwelt and light, And with the dews that pitied her, And with the winds that soothed her sadness; A homed, yet homeless sufferer, Watch'd by the sun, the moon, the grey Of moonless night, and sunless day: And watch'd by Adwick's madness. III. If chanced the warm autumnal skies To lure the adder from its bed, (Where the bog-myrtle's fruit turn'd red, Or violets, blowing late, smell'd sweet, And the bank sloped, the morn to meet,) Green, blazed its never-closing eyes; “Still is she here!” the adder said, And, like an eye-glance, vanishèd. IV. To slumber lull'd by wailings faint, Awaked by moanings of complaint, From his high seat, in sportive glee Down looking on her misery, The squirrel, morrow after morrow, Heard speech that sigh'd. The sun, at noon, still found her weeping; The sun, at eve, beheld her weeping, And bow'd his beamy head in sorrow; And when, at night, the otter stole From his root-roof'd and fishy hole Beneath the moonlit tree— The sound that mingled with the beam Reflected from the “watery gleam,” Was speech that sigh'd. V. When stoop'd the bramble's arm'd rich stems Beneath their darkening load of gems, And “on its thorny tree” the sloe Stole from the west a purply glow, While bees and blooms revisited The all-thorn'd gorse, she nothing said But, “Cruel was that friend of mine Who stole my pretty Telmarine.” But when the slow was blackly mellow, When the crab wore its flamy yellow, When starken'd the dim heav'ns with cold, And woods put on their crimson'd gold, She sigh'd, “The year is darkening down, The green locks of the crags turn brown, Ripe bramble-berries cover them, The fiend his club casts over them, And winter comes, in hail and rain; But Telmarine comes not again!” VI. When rose the heron in the wind, His legs outstretch'd his flight behind, In search of warmer skies; She gazed on him, with upturn'd eyes, And said, “Oh, thou, the fleet, the wild! Stay! tell me—Hast thou seen my child?” When after him the eagle pass'd, And over her his shadow cast, She said, “Thou strong of eye and wing! Far canst thou fly, and widely see; Oh, King-bird, seek her, find her, bring My Telmarine to me! Or I must die in misery.” Then, on the bird she strain'd her sight, Till he became a speck in light, And till, at last, he vanish'd quite; And then she gazed on empty air, Fearing to take her eyes away, As if her only hope was there, There—in that depth of barren grey, On which, with his last gasp of breath, Man tries to fix his gaze in death. Death!—face of stone, and soul of lath, Yet the last friend that misery hath— “A long sweet sleep awaiteth thee,” Saith ghastly Death to Misery! And he, in pity, on her smiled; For she must die! or find her child. And soon nor squirrel, otter, snake, Shall see her, from the wood or lake; Nor hawk, nor heron, from the sky Look on the maid, now fain to die. Pale, paler, weaker she became; Chill tremors shook her failing frame; And with slack knees, and swimming head She sank upon her sleepless bed, Where her worn face, a child's in size, Seem'd cold in woe, as polar skies, And polar snow. The fountain of her tears was dried; She wept no more, but ever sigh'd; Her heart broke not! 'twas petrified. VII. Then, came o'er Adwick's frenzied mind A change, like colour to the blind. Oh, deem not him a cruel man, That victim of a ruthless ban, And of compassionate sympathy, Which suffers in his destiny, And darkly, dreadly shares the fate That made him desolate! If thou would'st see the gentle sky Reflected in the lake, Bid the black tempest's agony Its tortured waves forsake; Then, shall the banks, the whispering trees The cloud, the herd, the rock, the hill, The foxglove, ay, the birds and bees, Live in that mirror bright and still. So, when warm tears gush'd from his brain, And cool'd its burning hell of pain, (Frenzy subsiding into sadness, And saddest pity conqu'ring madness,) He was himself again; Like one who wakes from dreams of woe, When blackest night is past—and, lo, Morn glitters on a world of snow! He saw his victim's mute despair; To see her die he could not bear. Himself he hated for the deed That laid her, like a withering weed, Before him—dying, helpless, pale; And if man's courage can avail, Oh, yet will he save Etheline! He will bring back her Telmarine. Yea, he hath sought the dread retreat, Where none may tread with unbless'd feet. Hark! Voices? Shouts? A fearful cry Wakes the green night of Mystery: “Oh, Sacrilege! a man defiled Hath from the hallow'd chamber borne The consecrated child!” And she, the Nun of Snow, hath sworn That he, the thief, whoe'er he be, Shall for his crime with life atone, And suffer on the slaughter-stone Pain's worst extremity. VIII. “The little hand of Telmarine Presses thy bosom, Etheline! The soft warm cheek of Telmarine Rests on thy cold face, Etheline! Konig's blue eyes, in Telmarine, Smile on the softer blue of thine. Is it not well?” said Adwick, sighing; “Art thou not happy?” “Yes, and dying, My Adwick!” pressing with her own His hand, she said, in sweetest tone, Her eyes on his o'er-flowing eyes Fix'd, “I am dying. Be not thou (My Friend! my Love!) offended now, That my soul yearns again to see My Konig's face. If thou lov'st me, Love Konig, too. And when I'm dead— When number'd are my vanities; When aching heart, and reeling head, And throbbing pulse, are quieted, Tell him I loved him! and”—she smiled On little Telmarine—“the child I leave behind me. Bid him take My child, and love it for my sake— As I love it for his. In heart A mother, tell him—I depart In soul a bride; In truth, a virgin; satisfied To be, in soul, his bride.” IX. While thus she spoke, Lord Konig paced His castle and the lake between, With cold hand on his hot brow placed, And blood-shot eyeballs, in despair Fix'd wildly on the Wizard's chair, Far over wood and water seen. Earth, and the clear heav'n overhead, Were tranquil as the sinless dead; They might have sooth'd and tranquillized A heart less torn and agonized; But the mute clouds, the stirless air, The silent light, the lake at rest, All, mock'd the tumult in his breast, The tempest raging there; When—as a smile lights silently The lip of sleeping infancy— Out of the still lake's crystal bright, Out of the silent air and light, Seeming to soul and sight A portion of the air and light, The form, the face of Telma came! In all her living loveliness She stood before him. Motionless, (Save that her moving lips display'd What seem'd the teeth's pure ivory, Like white flowers trembling in the shade,) She utter'd his dear name! Death had not from her stature taken Its graceful slightness: Still seem'd to heave, in blissful whiteness, Her bosom soft and warm: Nor had the dewy rose forsaken Her full lip's eloquent charm; Nor on her cheek had morning faded; Nor had the eyes, which black locks shaded; Lost their black brightness. Yet was there a solemnity, A marble fixedness of eye, In her dread beauty; in her look A calmness—Oh, Thou Wizard's Chair, And thy grim guest of bone and hair! That calmness took The fever-flush from Konig's cheek, And paled it, as with fear; It was the look that bids hearts break Hope shudder, and bereavement seek No solace here. X. “Konig!” in speech that was not song, Yet sweeter far, she said, Or whisperèd, “The hours of God, seem long To man's impatience, and to me; For slowly, mercifully still, Ev'n to the freed of death, Himself and his unerring will The All-wise discovereth. We are not fitted yet to be Where dwell the painless, where the pure Live with the pure in purity. Much must thou dare, and more endure, Ere we can wed as spirits wed. Yet did I err not when I said, ‘In heav'n our marriage-feast is spread, And well are they who love the dead;’ For none are happy but the true; And, Konig, we have work to do. Go, then, to lonest Waterside; There kiss, thy chaste, thy virgin-bride; Long hast thou been expected there, And she hath yet a pang to bear; For one, whom yet thou may'st not see, (The Angel of Extremity, Whose touch of ice, and look of steel, All who draw breath are doom'd to feel,) Bends there o'er Etheline, and weeps. A precious gift for thee she keeps; Our child! oh, place her in thy bower, And tend, for me, my living flower! Ordain'd to win For us an Eden, lost by sin, She bends to Heav'n Both me and thee. Nay, kneel not—no! ask not of me Forgiveness—Art thou not forgiv'n? Strive not to clasp the impassive air; But do thy mission! and prepare, On earth, for heav'n. I'll meet thee there— Where no harsh fates annul Love's law of blissful trust; And Beauty casts between Her smiles serene And the All-loving Beautiful, No veil of dust.” XI. As light, when noon puts darkness on, Gilds a wan rose, and disappears; So Telma, smiling on his tears, Turns from her Konig—and is gone. He gasps, he bids the vision stay; His heart hath years of thought to say. What would'st thou clasp? and whom address? Here smiles no loved one's loveliness. The stirless air, the lake at rest, The light and silence on its breast, The sleeping cloud, the sleeping tree, The music of the busy bee, The tremble of the lifted leaf; And one vain mortal—bow'd with grief, As if on his crush'd heart had come, With all their weight of guilty fears, The burden of a thousand years; And on his cheek, and youthful bloom, The stain of an eternal tear; These only (and thy God!) are here. XII. Lord Konig in his bark is gone, Over the lake of Dar and Don, To lonely Waterside, Where everplayful Telmarine, With looks that sweetly chide, Wonders at silent Etheline! “Why will not mother speak?” She says, with saddening cheek, And still-enquiring eyes, To which no voice, no look replies! While Adwick, watching near, And scarcely seeming ought to hear, Or feel, or know, (Yet too, too conscious,) stands, With cold, damp forehead, and clasp'd hands, Gazing on hopeless woe, That vainly loves! on speechless pain, And dying truth—beloved in vain! XIII. How like the beauteous awfulness That moulders into clay, And humbles man's hard-heartedness With its sublime decay, Upon her couch of death she lay! Nor limb, nor feature stirr'd. But when Lord Konig's foot she heard, Like one arising from the dead, She started, she lean'd up in bed; (Oh, Love is strong!) she rose to greet him; (Oh, Love is strength!) she went to meet him; She met him—met his dear embrace; And in his bosom hid her face. XIV. They seated them upon a stone, Wash'd by the rains of ages gone, And bleach'd by every blast that blew; With forests brown, and Konig's town, And the lake's mirror, all in view; (She leaning fondly on his knee, He weeping o'er her tenderly;) And talk'd to sleep each little leaf; And talk'd the sun down to the west; Nor saw him veil his head in grief, And sadden into golden rest. Death, all-shunn'd death, she knew, was nigh, Yet felt as if she could not die. But when, at length, the parting hour Gloom'd dimly on the dying flower, Then Konig trembled—and she smiled! Giving to him the willing child. “Kiss me!” (she said, scarce audibly, While, sick with parting's agony, He felt as if they could not part,) “Kiss me! and go. I die content. Love our poor Adwick—he loves me: Farewell!” He wept, as if his heart Was made of tears—and went. She watch'd them o'er the lake; She saw him leap to land, Place on the shore the child, and take Its little offer'd hand; Then, shuddering as she turn'd her head, Sank at the feet of Adwick—dead. XV. Sad, from the dell of Ravensly, A wail of chaunting echo'd wide; Harsh, in oak-waving Denaby, A trumpet's brazen laugh replied; And far o'er Watchly came the cry That ever told when doom was nigh, When cruel gods claim'd bloody rites, And men prepared for ghastly sights. But Adwick heard no trumpet blow, No chaunt, no death-dirge, wailing low; Mute as a stone, and tranced in woe, He stood! and moved Nor hand, nor foot, nor lock of hair; But, like a statue of despair, Gazed on the warm, yet lifeless snow, That still was all he loved. Lo! one by one, fierce men surround him! By him unheard, unseen, they come, All sable vested, Sable helm'd, and sable crested; They are the ministers of doom, Whom follows slow The Nun of Snow; And they have seized and bound him. XVI. Then, Adwick saw, approaching nigh, A form of haughtiest dignity. Never was grander presence seen, Or loftier stature. The demon in his nature Wore a sublimely mournful mien; And as he trod The shrinking sod, He seem'd not less than demigod. Crisp curl'd his locks of auburn hue O'er features beautiful, High brow, thin lips, arch'd nose; A face of marble-like repose, Whose coldness shamed young June's white rose. Yet on his front scowl'd rigor. Blue, Watch'd his fix'd eyes—small, cavern'd, dull; And cuplike ears, placed wide apart, Before a knotted mass of skull, Proclaim'd a tyrant's brain and heart; Though his sad smile turn'd dim The sun's glad calmness, as he set, And Autumn's violet Stole a sweet look of tears from him. XVII. “Infidel!” Slowly, thus he spoke, In tones that on the hearer broke Like dying thunder. “It is well That we are mighty, Infidel! Or tortured human life, in vain, Would petrify Love's tears with pain. Live, then, to feel, in heart and brain, Worst pain's intensity of pain, Ere death dismiss thy atheist soul, To tenant some vile toad or owl, Or stinking fox, or filthier swine, And find no beastlier shape than thine.” XVIII. “Bend not thy cruel brow on me, Priest!” Adwick answer'd mournfully; “I know thy power, and pity thee. The feet that on long-suffering trod Cannot crush out my trust in God; Nor canst thou waste, or use in vain, His fund of dreadful mercy, pain. Me thou canst rack, my blood canst spill; But there's a power thou canst not kill, The will and power To Think and Know. Sure is its march, however slow; And it shall put to shame and flight The darkness which to thee is light: Torturing, and blackening, like a sky Darken'd with arrows—Infamy, Though she hath done your bidding well, Shall find the truth invincible. Nor will my disembodied soul Live in the shape of toad or owl, (Shapes, not despised by Power Divine, Nor less august, perchance, than thine,) But—with the spirit of that form Which there invites the wasting worm— Delight to number, as they fly, The age-long hours of Deity; Until, at last, Hate's altars fall, And Loving-kindness conquer all.” XIX. “With her? This impious wretch! So foul, And yet so fair?” the King-Priest said; And, not unmoved, contemplated The beauteous corpse. “Her wretched soul Is now a crow's. Her carrion soon Shall feed the wolf, beneath the moon And winking stars.” Scornful, he spoke, Though pity in his heart awoke; Then, self-reproach'd, threw back his head, While blacken'd on his lip of bile The fiend of his unwilling smile— And kick'd, with cruel foot, the dead. XX. Darkens in grief the snowy Nun; Slow, down her cheek the large tears run: Burns Adwick's brow. His fetter'd hands Smite the Priest-Monarch, where he stands. He strives, with desperate strain, To break his bonds. His dizzy brain Flames. Down he drops. Half-raised, he sighs, Falls back, and deeply sighs: See! how the fetter'd Lion dies! Yet his last looks, his closing eyes, Seek the dear, outraged form, that lies Beside him, marble-pale and still, And angel-fair; And Love's strong will, With his last breath, Stamps on his failing motion grace, And beauty on his heart-worn face, Even in death; While gasp the sable-helm'd, and stare. Oh, thou large heart, and ample chest! Oh, Man contemn'd, reviled, oppress'd! (Yet not unloved, though rude thy form; Nor all-contemn'd, nor all-unbless'd, Though trampled, like a trampled worm;) Join, in the realm that knows not pain, Thy vainly loved, who loved in vain, And there thy soul's high lineage prove; Though conquer'd, not enslaved; Not lost! but saved By All-Redeeming Love. XXI. “He hath escaped,” the King-Priest said. Then, turn'd he to the lifeless maid. Nor armlet she, nor anklet wore, But on her veiny wrist A clasp of amethyst, And on her right third finger fair A relic, which he valued more; A ring of gold-and-silver twist, And Homer's auburn-silver'd hair. He took the ring, and from her wrist The nun its clasp of amethyst, The mighty spell by which men knew She could o'ercome, far off, the foe Who but in thought might work her woe; And then the darkness-clad withdrew The long rich robe of tyrian hue Which, folded round her beauteous waist, And underdrawn, her hips embraced; Leaving her naked, where she lay, To be of worms and wolves the prey. Thus sternly Highest Love decided, That not by death divided, But side by side, like groom and bride, Should lie, at last, His sternly tried; And, lo, the pair are not alone, Though priest, and nun, and guard are gone! Above them bends A form that godlike man's transcends, When godlike most; a face of pride, More mournful than a fallen king's Whose world-wide realms are miseries, Whose empire, splendors fled! And in his mien Such majesty is seen, That in heav'n's courts he might have borne A demigod's regalities, And on immortal shoulders worn Archangel's wings. “These are but seeds of future weeds Sown to replace our hated race,” In thought, he sighs, Contemplating the dead; And to the skies Raising his heav'n-reft eyes, Adds, with serenely saddest brow, “Will not the seed He soweth grow?” LAST LINES. The Poet's last utterances, dictated on his death-bed to his daughter. Thy notes, sweet Robin, soft as dew, Heard soon or late, are dear to me; To music I could bid adieu, But not to thee! When from my heart Earth's lifeful throng Shall pass away, no more to be, Oh! Autumn's primrose, Robin's song, Return to me!</field>
