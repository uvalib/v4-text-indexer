Ecce, quod natura mutat sua iura: Virgo parit pura dei filium. 1 Beholde and see, how that nature Chaungith here lawe: a mayden pure Shalle bere a chielde (thus seith scripture), Ihesus, oure sauyour. 2 Beholde, the flease of Gedeon Wexed wete, that no dewe fel on; Beholde, the yerde of Aaron Vnmoysted bare a floure. 3 The prophete Isay seith thus: âA mayde shall bere a childe to vs, Whose name shall be called Ihesus, Oure helpe and our socour. 4 A yerde shall goo oute of Iesse rote, Wherof a floure shall ascende full soote.â This floure is Crist, oure helth and boote, This yerde Mary, his boure. 5 Seynt Mathew seith in the gospell: âA mayde shall bere Emanuell, That is to sey, god with vs to dwell, That louely paramour.â 6 Forsoth, to vs is borne a chielde, A sonne is yeven to vs full myelde Of virgyne Marie vndefielde To cease oure grete langoure. 7 This is the stone cutte of the hille, Criste borne of Marie vs vntille Without synne in thought, dede and wille To save vs fro dolour. 8 This chielde shall be the prince of peas, Whose kingdome shall euir encrease, Wherof the peas shall neuir ceas, But encreace day and houre. 9 Seint Anselme seith: âSo Criste did pas Thurgh Marie myelde, as his wille was, As the sonne beame goth thurgh the glas, That mayde full of honoure.â XVIII. Ecce, quod natura Mutat sua iura: Virgo parit pura Dei filium. 1 Bothe yonge and olde, take hede of this: The cours of nature chaunged is: A mayde, that neuir did amys, Hath borne oure sauyoure. 2 What tyme mankynde had done amys And for his mys was put fro blis, A roose, a valent floure, i-wis, Crist made springe of a thorne. 3 Criste hath made springe oute of a thorne A mayde, that hym mekely hath borne Beyng bothe afture and beforne As pure, as lilly floure. 4 As a swete floure berith his odoure, This mayden myelde of grete honoure Withouten maternall doloure Oure sauyour hath borne. 5 Vpon a nyght an aungell bright From blis downe light saiyng full right: âThurgh goddes myght a worthy wight Hath borne oure savyoure.â 6 Than kingis three fro ferre cuntre In her degre came for to se This king so free of magestee, That in Bedleme was borne. XIX. A Roose hath borne a lilly white, The whiche floure is moost pure and bright. 1 To this roose aungell Gabriell Seide: âThou shalt bere Emanuell, Both god and man with vs to dwell;â The which floure is most pure and bright. 2 This roose, the prophete Ysaye Seyde, shulde conceyve and bere Messy Withouten synne or velonye; The which flour is moost pure and bright. 3 As the sonne beame goth thurgh the glas, Thurgh this roose that lilly did pas To save mankynde, as his wille was; The whiche floure is moost pure and bright. 4 This roose so myelde aye vndefielde Hath borne a childe for man so wilde By fraude begiled, from blis exiled; The whiche flour is moost pure and bright. 5 This roose so good at the cros stode With wofull moode, when Crist, oure foode, Shed his hert bloode for man so woode; The which flour is moost pure and bright. 6 This swete roose pray bothe nyght and day, Withoute denay that we come maye To blis for ay the redy waye; The which flour is moost pure and bright. XX. There sprunge a yerde of Iesse moore: There was neuer none suche before, Ne non shalbe. This yerde was Marie, virgyne fre. 1 As Aaron yerde withoute moistoure Hath florisshed and borne a floure, So hath she borne oure savyoure Withouten touche of dishonoure Of mannes sede; For god his self in her did brede. 2 King Assuere was wrothe, i-wis, Whenne quene Vasty had done amys, And of her crowne priuat she is; But, when Hester his yerde did kis, By hir mekenes She chaunged his moode into softnes. 3 King Assuere is god almyght, And quene Vasty synagoge hight, But, when Vasty had lost hir lyght, Quene Hester thanne did shyne full bright, For she forth brought The sonne of god, that alle hath wrought. 4 As Moyses yerde, that was so goode, Turned the waters into bloode, So did Mary moost myelde of moode Vnder the cros, where as she stoode Full sore weping: Her teres ran with blode bleding. 5 She is that yerde, that yevith vs light Of Criste, oure king, to haue a sight. She is redy bothe day and nyght To yelde oure cause to god almyght To save oure sore, That quene of blis for euirmore. 6 Now beseche we that yerde so free Mediatrix for vs to be Vnto that king of magestee, In blis that we his face may see Withoute ending Afture this fynalle departing. XXI. Vnto Marie he that loue hath, To here synge he: âMagnificat.â 1 Thus seide Mary of grete honoure: âMy soule my lord dothe magnifie, And in my god and sauyoure My spirite reioyseth, verily. 2 For he the mekenes hath beholde Of his handemayde, that lorde so good. That I am blessed manyfolde, Alle kynredes shall sey of myelde moode. 3 For he, that is so full of myght, So grete thingis to me hath done.

God bothe iij and one Is oure comforte alone. 1 Adam and Eve did geve concent Vnto the feende, that vile serpent; Wherfore mankyende to helle was sent Without comfort alone. 2 Whenne it therin long tyme hadde layne, Crist, goddes sonne, came, in certayne, To take nature and suffre payne To comfort it alone. 3 As the sonne beame gothe thurgh the glas, Thurgh virgyne Marie he did pas Taking nature, as his wille was, To save mankynde alone. 4 That lorde so good vpon the roode Suffred vile dethe and shed his bloode; Whoos flesshe and bloode is endeles foode To feithfull man alone. 5 Now beseche we that king of grace In blis for to graunte vs a place And hym to se there face to face, That is bothe iij. and one. XLVI. The sone of god alone Hath made vs free echeone. 1 The faders sonne of heven blis Of a pure mayde man bicome is To for-geve man, that did amys, By his mekenes allone. 2 Bothe yonge and olde we were forlorn For synne, that Adam did beforne, Till of a mayde this chielde was born To make vs fre alone. 3 Moder Mary and virgyne pure Clothed hym with mortall vesture And closed hym in her clausure Of chastite allone. 4 When he was xxx.?? winter olde, For xxx. plates he was solde To the Iewes wikked and bolde By fals Iudas alone. 5 Vpon his hede a crowne of thorne The Iewes sette than with grete scorne, And with scourgis his flesshe they torne For our trespas alone. 6 The Iewes thanne of wikked moode Nayled his bodye on the roode, Wheron he shed his precious bloode To make vs free alone. 7 He was dede and in his graue leyde And rose ayene, as scripture seide, On the iij.?? daye and to blis steyde, Both god and man alone. 8 Now beseche we this king of grace, That we may haue a dwelling place And euir to see his glorious face In heven blis echeone.

XLVIII. The sone of god is man become Pro salute fidelium. 1 The sonne of god and king of blis, Whoos ioye and blis shall neuir mys, Of a pure mayde man become is Pro salute fidelium. 2 What tyme Adam, oure first parent, Had geve consent to the serpent, As man to die was his entent Pro salute fidelium. 3 Whenne he was xxx. winter olde, For xxx plates he was solde By fals Iudas to Iewes bolde Pro salute fidelium. 4 Vppon his hede a crowne of thorne The Iewes sette thanne with gret scorne, And with scourgis his flesshe was torne Pro salute fidelium. 5 The Iewes than of wikked moode Nayled his body on the roode, Wheron he shed his precious bloode Pro salute fidelium. 6 He was dede and in his graue leyde, And the iij.?? day, as scripture seyde, He rose ayene and to blis steyde Pro salute fidelium. 7 He toke with hym withoute delay Moder Marie, wyfe and may, The whiche incessantly doth pray Pro salute fidelium. 8 That lorde and king by his grete myght Cause vs to dwell in blisse so bright, That fro blis into Mary light Pro salute fidelium.

LXXXVI. In Criste Ihesu be we alle gladde, By whome oure ioye endeles is hadde. 1 The high fader of blisse aboue Hathe sent his sonne to take nature For his grete charite and loue Of Marie myelde, that virgyne pure, And so on vs to do his cure And to bringe vs fro endeles woo And fro the feende, oure goostely foo. 2 Gabriell of so high degre Was sent fro god (scripture seith soo) To Nazareth of Galilee, And to Marie thus seide he thoo: âHaile, full of grace withouten woo: The lorde god is dwelling with the; Of alle women blessed thou be!â 3 Whenne she hurde this, she was afrayde And thought, what greting this myght be. âDrede not, Marie,â the aungell seyde: âThou hast founde grace, thou mayden free, Before one god in persones thre. Thou shalt conceyve and bere the same, The sonne of god, Ihesus by name. 4 He shalle be grete and called shall be The sonne of the highest of alle, And god shall geve hym Dauid see, And ay shall reigne in Iacobes halle; Whose high kingdome is eternall; For of heuen and erthe alsoo He is the lorde: there is nomoo.â 5 Marie seide to the aungell than: âHowe shall this be, that thou doest hight, Sith I purpose to know no man And shall conceyve the king of myght?â He aunswered her, that aungell bright: âThe holygoost shall light in the; By whome Criest shall conceyved be. 6 Elizabeth, thy cosyn, loo, In her olde age, that bareyn went, Hath conceyved a chielde alsoo By grace of god omnipotent; Wherefore, good lady, geve concent; For there shall be neuir a worde Inpossible vnto that lorde.â 7 Magnifiyng god manyfolde Vnto the aungell then seide she: âThe handemayde of oure lorde beholde. As thou haste seyde, be done to me.â Thus conceyved this mayden free By her mekenes god and man thoo To bringe mankyende fro endeles woo. 8 This mayden myelde hath borne a chielde, As prophetis seide longe tyme before, To save mankyende, that was exielde, And to blisse it for to restore. Oure ioye is wonne for euirmore; For Criste hath brought mankyende fro woo And fro the fende, oure mortall foo. LXXXVII. As Gabriell archaungell seyde, Now Criste is borne of a pure meyde. 1 That archaungell shynyng full bright Came vnto Marie, that myelde mayde, Bringyng tydingis fro god almyght, And vnto her mekely he sayde: âHaile, full of grace: be not afrayde. God is with the in euery place. Thou shalt conceyve the king of grace.â 2 âHowe shalle this be,â this mayden than Seyde to that archaungell so bright, âSith I purpose to knowe no man And shall conceyve the sonne of myght?â âThe holygoost in the shall light, And thurgh his working thou shalt be Moder of god in persones thre.â 3 âEcce, ancilla,â thenne seide she, âBeholde the handemayde of oure lorde. The wille of god be done in me In dede, in thought, in wille and worde.â And thus, as scripture bereth recorde, Marie, that mayde moost of honoure, Hath borne Ihesus, oure sauyoure. 4 The prophesy fulfilled is Of the prophetis nowe alle and sume; For why the faders sonne of blis To save mankyende is man becume. To hym therfore be we not dume, But lete vs singe and make alle myrth In honoure nowe of his swete birth. LXXXVIII. âAwake, Ioseph, awake, awake, And to Marie thy way thou take.â 1 Iosephe wolde haue fled fro that mayde, Not for noo synne ne for offence, But to abyde he was affrayde In here so good and pure presence Extans virgo concipiens, The mysterie for cause he knew In her of so full grete vertue. 2 âWith her,â he seide, âwhy shulde I dwell? Than I, of degre she is more, And in vertue she doth excelle: I wille departe from her therefore.â But god, that hath alle grace in store, Sent an aungell, that was full bright, Vnto Ioseph vpon a nyght. 3 [And vnto hym that aungell seide:] âDrede not, Iosephe, sonne of Dauid, To take Marie, thy wyfe, that mayde, For why the chielde, that she goth with, Is goddes sonne: be not afrayde. Long tyme before scripture hath sayde, That a pure mayde shulde bere a chield To save mankyende, that was exield.â 4 Ioseph a-rose and went full right Vnto Marie, that mayden myelde, And thurgh vertue of god almyght He founde that mayden grete with chielde, And yet she had hym not begielde, For why Ihesus, the sonne of right, Fro blis into her wombe did light. 5 Beholde, how Eve, that woman wielde, Hath borne hir frute in care and woo, But virgyne Marie, moder myelde, Hath borne her frute, but nothing soo; For she hath borne Criste and nomoo Forto defende vs fro the feende And geve vs blisse withouten ende. 6 The frute of deth Eve gave to vs, But that pure mayde and moder dere Gave vs the frute of lyfe Ihesus, Wherfore next god she hath no pere Aboue in blisse ne in erthe here, For why her sete is next the trone Of god, that is bothe iij. and one. XC. O synfull man, beholde and se, What thy maker hath done for Ã¾e. 1 âO my dere sonne, why doest thou soo? Why doest thou suffre alle this payne? Thou bringest my hert in care and woo Without offence to se the slayne, To see the blede at euery vayne And to beholde thy louely syde With a sharpe spere wounded so wyde. 2 To se thy hede crowned with thorne The blode rennyng vppon thy face, Thy flesshe also with scourgis torne Thus cruelly in euery place, This is to me a woofull case, Sith that thou art myne owne dere chielde And I thy moder vndefiled.â 3 âMy dere moder, wepe thou nomore And moorne nomore, moder, for me, For why it greveth me full sore In care and woo the forto see, Sith I haue take nature of the And am thy sonne, as thou hast seide, Thou beyng bothe moder and meyde. 4 This wofull payne now will I take And bitter dethe, moder, also Onely for synfull mannes sake To bringe hym out of payne and woo And fro the fende, his mortall foo: Though that he be vnkyende to me, Yet will I die to make hym free.â 5 âSith thou art king of heven blis And lorde of alle, dere sonne, also, Why shuldest thou die for mannes mys And suffre alle this payne and woo, Sith that he is thy mortall foo Thus with scourgis forto scourge the And thus to nayle the on a tre? 6 Myne owne dere sonne, it greveth me For to beholde thy woundes smert, To se the nayled on a tree Thy blode bleding oute of thyn hert. Why doest thou bere mannes desert, Sith that to the he is vnkyende And loue of hym thou cannest non fynde?â 7 âScripture, moder, I must fulfille, Wherefore I toke nature of the, For why it is my faders wille, That I shall die to make man fre. It is the wille also of me To suffre deth for mannes mys And bringe hym to eternall blis. 8 Sith man of me mercy doth craue And I am lorde of indulgence, Of my pite I will hym save And forgeve hym alle his offence. With hym, truly, I will dispence And pay his raunsom on the rode With the treasoure of my hert blode.â XCIX. Right, as the aungell tolde, it is, That nowe is borne the king of blis. 1 The prophesy fulfilled is Of the prophetes now alle and sume, For why the faders sonne of blis To save mankyende is man bicome. And why is this, but for oure mys, That now is borne the king of blis? 2 His loue to vs was so feruent, That he came downe, that lorde so good, Fro blisse in to this vale present And of Mary toke flesshe and blode. And why was this, but for oure mys, That now is borne the king of blis? 3 And so oure nature he hath take To his godhede withouten synne And hath brought vs oute of that lake, That oure parent had brought vs in. And why was this, but for oure mys, That nowe is borne the king of blis? 4 By vertu of the holy goost, Into here wombe that downe did light, The sonne of god of myghtis moost She hath brought furth, that mayden bright. And why was this, but for oure mys, That nowe is borne the king of blis? 5 As the sonne beame goth thurgh the glas, And as a floure berith his odoure, So Crist of her conceyved was And borne of her withoute doloure. And why was this, but for oure mys, That now is borne the king of blis? 6 Beholde and see the lowe descence Of Criest, that is so high in trone, To take nature for oure offence, The whiche offence did neuir none. And why was this, but for oure mys, That now is borne the king of blis? 7 When he was borne, that lorde and king, Oute of thraldome to bringe mankyende, âIoye be to godâ, aungellis did synge, In holy scripture as we fyende. And why was this, but for oure mys, That now is borne the king of blis? 8 Now beseche we this king of grace For to graunte vs a place in blis And hym to se there face to face, There ioye and peas shall neuir mysse. And why is this, but for oure mys, That nowe is borne the king of blis? C. A chielde is borne with vs to dwell: Nomen eius Emanuell. 1 âThis is the stone kut of the hille,â Thus seith the prophete Daniell, âBorne of a mayde in dede and wille.â Nomen eius Emanuell. Scripture full welle to vs doth tell, Nomen eius Emanuell. 2 Thus seide the prophete Ysay Long tyme before, or it befell: âA meyde shall bere a chield, truly, Nomen eius Emanuell.â Scripture full well to vs doth tell, Nomen eius Emanuell. 3 âHe is oure lorde,â seith Ieramye, âThis chielde now borne with vs to dwell, And non like hym is fare ne neye.â Nomen eius Emanuell.

Scripture full well to vs doth tell, Nomen eius Emanuell. 6 Nowe lete vs pray bothe alle and sume To this aungell of alle counsell , To heuen blisse that we may cume. Nomen eius Emanuell. Scripture full well to vs doth tel l, Nomen eius Emanuell. CI. Mary so myelde of hert and myende Hath borne a childe to save mankyende. 1 Mary so myelde and good of fame By vertu of the holygoost Hath borne a chielde, Ihesus by name, To save mankyende, the whiche was lost. 2 Marie so myelde in hert and myende, As Gabriell to her behight, Hath borne a chielde to save mankyende, The son of god and king of myght. 3 Marie so myelde, that quene of grace, Hath borne a chielde (scripture seith soo) To bringe mankyende out of that place, Where is bothe peyne and endeles woo. 4 Mary so myelde in worde and thought Hath borne a chielde, Ihesus soo good, The whiche ayene mankyende hath bought On the roode tree with his hert bloode. 5 Mary so myelde in dede and wille Hath borne a chielde, that made alle thing, To whom althing obeyeth by skille, As to theire prince, theire lorde and king. 6 Mary so myelde, so pure and clene Vnto hir chielde, that hath no pere, By hir mekenes she is a meane, That we shalle come to heven quere. 7 Mary so myelde, moder and may, Hath borne a chielde by hir mekenesse, That shall bringe vs at domes day Fro thraldom, peyn, woo and distresse. 8 Pray we to hym with worde and thought, That myelde Marie now furth hath brought, Whose infinite goodenesse may nought Esse seca. CIII. Mary hath borne alone The sonne of god in trone. 1 Thus to her seide an aungell thoo: âHaile, full of grace withouten woo; Thou shalt conceyve and bere alsoo Both god and man alone.â 2 This mayden seide to the aungell: âHow shalle this be (to me thou tell), A mayde sith I entende to dwell, Witnesse of god alone?â 3 The aungell saide: âO mayden free, The holygoost shall light in the, And thurgh his workyng thou shalt be Moder of god alone.â 4 âGoddes handemayde beholde,â seide she. âAs thou hast seide, be done to me: As oure lorde wille, so moote it be; His wille be done alone.â 5 He toke his leve, that aungell bright, Of hir and went to blisse full right, And she hath born, as he behight, Both god and man alone. CIV. Mary myelde made grete mone For her dere sonne alone. 1 When fals Iudas her son had solde To the Iewes wikked and bolde, As he before to hir had tolde, She was wofull alone. 2 When he came to Cayphas and An To be iuged for synfull man, In her hert she was woofull than For hir dere son alone. 3 When that she sawe his flessh to-torn And on his hede a crowne of thorn And, how the Iewes hym did shorn, She was wofull alone. 4 When hir dere son, Ihesus so goode, Was nayled fast vppon the roode, She sobbed and wept watre and bloode For hir dere son alone. 5 Whenne hir dere son on the thirde day With hir did mete and thus did say: âHayle, holy moder, wyfe and may,â She was ioyfull alone.

CVI. Mary so myelde alone For her chielde made grete mone. 1 In prophesy thus it is saide, The whiche no wyse may be denayde, That Criest shulde be borne of a mayde To save mankyende alone. 2 âMielde Maryâ thus this mayden hight, Her son Ihesus so full of myght For to bringe vs ayene to light Died for vs alone. 3 Symeon seide, the swerde shulde goo Thurgh hir myelde hert of care and woo, For her son shuld dey (and nomoo) To save mankyende alone. 4 This mayden wept watre and blode To see her son so myelde and goode To suffre deth vpon the rode For synfull man alone. 5 Noo hert can thinke, noo tunge tell can The peyne, that this mayde suffred than To se her son, both god and man, To die for man alone. 6 As grevous payne to her and woo It was to see her sone die soo, As vnto hym, that died thoo To save mankyende alone.
