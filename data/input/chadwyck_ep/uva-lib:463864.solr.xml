The paragraphs have been captured, but the markers ignored. the boke of Cato both in Latyn and Englyshe. For thy that god is inwardly the wytte Of man, and geuith him vnderstanding As dite is sayne, therfore shal thou vnshitte Thyne hert to thy soueraine lord and king Principally aboue all other thyng: Geuing him laude honour and reuerence, Whiche hath endowed the with exulence. Awake my chyld, and loue no slogardie: In long slepe and loke thou neuer delite, Yf thou purpose, to worshyp for to stie. Longe slepe and slouth, to vices men exite, It makith dull, it makith inperfite It fosterith vp the filthes of the flesshe, It wastith eke, and pallith blodes freshe. Trust well also, the first of vertues alle, Is to be stil, and kepe thy tongue in mewe: Of tonge vntide muche harme may falle: Leue me well, this is as gospell trewe, Who can dalians of tongue esshewe, And rest with reason, this is the vray texte To god aboue that man is alder nexte. Auyse the well, that thou neuer trauerse Thyne own sent?ce, for therof cometh shame. Say not one &amp; eft c?trary reherse, such repugn?ce, wil make thy honour lame Where stedfastnes, wil cause y? good fame. For he shal neuer accorde with man alyue: That w? himself, will ay repugne &amp; striue. If thou aduertise and beholde aboute, The lyfe of men, and the maners also, Bothe of thy selfe, and other there without In myddell earth, thou shalt fynde, who That in some part, is to vertu fo. Blame no man therfore, if thou doe ryght: Sith in earth lacles, lyueth no wyght. If y? suppose thinges shall annoye &amp; greue, Though they be dere &amp; of right great price, Suche as suffreth not thy profit If the lust to be ruled, as the wyse Absteine the fr? suche thynges in al wyse. For it is more wysdome in sothfastnesse, To preferre profite, than suche rychesse. It is a good lesson for the nones, A wyght now to be t?pred with c?staunce, And to be mery and glad eftsones: Not alway sad, ne lyght of countenaunce. A mans chere may full oft auaunce: For at eche tyme, as the thyng requireth, So the wyse man visageth and chereth. Geue not credence alway to thy wyfe, That for her yre, and her vnpacience With sharper tong, th? is swerde or knife, Playneth on thy serua?t, though no off?ce Thou finde in him: lerne wel this sentence The wyfe wyll hate, &amp; cause for to smerte Oftimes him, her husband loueth w? herte. And if thou warne a wyght of his forfayte: Although he grudge w? frowing co?ten?ce And in his language, manace the &amp; thrate: Yet forbere not for all suche displesaunce. To teache him to amende his gouernaunce As thou began, corecte that is amysse, And that is a frendly tuche ywysse. Against the wordy folke ay full of wynde, Striue not at all, it may the not profite: Such Iayissh people, ben in c?ceites blinde The witlesse worde, auayleth not a myte. In many wordes, is wysdome oft full lyte. For to euery wyght, is geuen speche, And yet the wyse full oft ben to seche. Loue other men, and haue them so in chere That to thy self, thy loue may moste ext?de: Let no persone, be to the more dere Than thy estate, for th? shalt thou offende. And hurt thy selfe and other folke amende. But ay loue other and cherysshe them so, That to thy selfe thou be not founden foo. Rumours newe that flyen as the wynde, Eschue my chylde with all thy diligence: Be neuer besy, newe tidynges to fynde, Suche nouelte, causeth oft offence, It is no wit it is no sapience. It hurteth not a man to be in peace, But it doth harme, to put his t?g in preace. Make no promyse of other mens beheste, Rem?bre the well, that promesse is vnsure: And but thou kepe thine, thy name y? sleest, To serue thy behest do thy besy cure. Trust not the worde of euery creature, Some mennes feyth is easy to breke: For many folke thynke not, as they speke. With wordes faire, whan fauel fedeth the: Be thou not blind, for al his false flatterie, Let thine own reason alway, thy iudge be. And in effecte, if thyne estate be hie, though fauel w? his craft, wold blinde thine eye, In all thy lyfe, thou neuer geue credence, More to thy selfe, than to thy concience. Whan thou seest another mannes deserte, As for his good dedes comendable, In euery place priuie and perte, Suche a wight, w? thy good word enhable. And though y? haue ben right amyable, Of thy good dede, make thou none aua?ce: And than other m?, shal thy name enha?ce. And thou liuel?g, an olde m? shalt thou be, Age wyll aproche, maugre in who say nay. Than aperceyue, beholde about and se, How aged folke been entreated euery daye, And so to puruoye for thy selfe assaye, Into stouping age whan thou art crept, Thyng may y? helpe, y? in yougth was kept. Care not, although some men speke softe, Ne change no chere: for oft it is ful bet In secrete wyse to speke, than crie on loft A man should se alway where he were set, And after that so should he speake or let. But to the suspect of harme it semeth, Men speke of hym, he none other demeth. Whan fortune, hath geuen them felicite, And set the on hie, than ware of a falle, Than sueth oft, full sharpe aduersite, Fals fortune turneth as doth a balle, In her haue thou no sekernes at alle. Her perilous play, sumtime turneth to grame: Thende is woo, of that began with game. Our bretel lyfe, is here so full of doubte, That in veray suretye no wight may stand Lo sodeynly crepeth the soules oute, All aboutes this worlde in euery land Of yong &amp; olde: for euery wight is bounde To deth: therfore set not thyne affiaunce In deth of him, ther may suruiue ?cha?ce. A lytle gift, geuen with good entent, Of thy frend y? lyueth in pouerte, With ryght good chere, suche giftes take &amp; hent, Supposyng ay, that as good wyll hath he And more, than many men that ryche be. Prayse not the gift, ne pondre not the price Thentent is good and that shal the suffice. Syth nature, that was thy fyrst norice, Hath brought the hyther all naked &amp; bare, Though thou can neuer richesse acc?plice, But y? art hold, alwaye in pouerties snare: Yet no force make neuer to muche care, Take paciently pouerte for the beste, Ryches is not of nature, but of queste. Though deth be fine of euery creature, And no wyght on lyue, may it escape, Yet drede not deth with ouerbesy cure. To lyue in erth, than is it but a Iape, If thou after death alwaye so gape. Thinke wel to die, but modifie thy thought Or elles to lyue, auaileth the right nought. For thy desert, if no wyght thanke the, I meane, wh? y? hast done thy force &amp; paine To other folke frendly for to be: If they can not to the gramercy sayne, Withdraw thy selfe, &amp; so thy hand refrayne Blame not thy god, for their vnfr?dlinesse: But for such folke, do afterwarde the lesse. Sith y? no riche m?, liueth there any where If he consume his goodes all and wast, But y? pouerte shal greue him sore &amp; dere: Therfore my chylde, such goodes as y? hast, Let not to sone, out of thy hand be raft, Lest y? thy goodes hereafter wil the fayle: Holde that thou hast, it may the oft auayle. Behete no man a thing, to lene him twyse, And fayle hym, that is but vilany. If thou may lene, do it in frendly wyse, Such cheuissa?ce, wil frendlynesse bewrie. Of thy good dedes, clamour not ne crie, Be not wordy ne of wordes breme, If a good man, the lust to apere and seme. And if thou finde, the son of doublenesse, The fals flatterer, if thou espie, with painted word, &amp; hert full of falsnesse: Thou maiest in no wise better blere his eie Than serue him with his owne trecherie. For wordes faire, &amp; frendlynesse no parte: Geue him the same, &amp; arte begile with arte. Preue not a m?, with ouer peynted speche, Under faire wordes, is oft couert gile. The worde is gay, but fr?dship is to seche, And as men say, suche craf is in this yle: some thinke harme, wh? thei her t?ges file The whystling fowler, maketh mery song And yet the byrdes, begileth he among. Whan y? god hath geuen the children fele, And riches small, than do you in this wise. Teche thy children with craftes for to dele, That by their art, they may th?self cheuise. If y? do thus, th? workest thou as the wyse, Craft is good, and craft is lucratife, By craft, they may defende the nedy lyfe. Haue this conceite, for it is often saine, Thynges dere, shal ofte abate of pryse: And thynges that of lytle value bene In tyme comynge, maye to derth aryse, Remembre this, &amp; it wel aduertise: Thus shal thou best, y? name of chincherye fleme And other m?, shal y? no nigarde deme. Auyse the wel, let reason be thy guyde Whan other m? thou art about to blame, That suche defaute be not in the espyede For if ther be, th? shall thou haue y? shame A m?s honour suchs thinges wyl reclame. It is ful foull whan y? a man wyll teche Yf his owne dedes, against his wordes preche Loke thy desyre, be grounded in a right And that it neuer trauers honeste For as often tymes as wyght Desyreth more than right and equite Than may his request repeled be And it is clepud nycete and grete folye To aske oft that men wyl ay denye. Cha?ge not thy fr?d, that y? knowest of old, For any newe, in trust y? thou shalt fynde Better than he: but in thy handes holde Him, that to y? hath frendly been and kinde: Suche changes ben full often blynde Thou wenest to know, &amp; yet knowest y? not a dele To knowe a frende, it is ful casuale Sithe mannes lyfe is ful of myserie, Some tyme in myrth, and after in mischiefe Now in the dale, Now in the mounte on hie Now man is pore, and oft ryches relefe The shynyng morow, hath oft a stormy eue To this polycie, take hede and entende: Loke thou haue lucre in thy labours ende. Though y? may be venged, &amp; haue victorie Of thy frende &amp; felowe, yet y? must forbere, Refraine thy selfe, be not to haute ne hie: Irous hastines, ful ofte men doth dere, where easy softnes, frendes may conquere, For by good dedes set in holines, Men ben togyder knet in frendlynes The lymytour that visiteth the wiues, Is wyse enough, of him a man may lere, To geue pynnes, purses, and knyues, This crafte is good, so doth the sely frere. Geue thinges smale for thinges y? ben dere If y? receiue, geue somewhat ay agayne, And that wil norishe frendes dere certaine. Touile not, ne striue w? him y? is thy frend, Beware of y?, make not thy frend thy foo: A touyllous man may frendship &amp; shende. These baratours that ben misruled soo, Entryp them selfe and wrap in much woo. for Ire of kinde, ?g?dreth nought but hate, Where as accorde, norysheth loue algate. Whan thy serua?t thou takest in defaute, Though he can not his negligence excuse, Yet in thyne yre, make not to fyers assaute: But with thy haste a while take truse, Thou shalt finde ease, this fete if y? can vse. Rule thy passion ay by suche mesure: That thou saue, that ben vnder thy cure. Suffera?ce doth ease, was said ful l?g ago, Suffre, and haue all thyne entent, Though thou may ouercome yet do not so. Conquere through suffera?ce, &amp; be paci?t, But to foule cruelte neuer consent. For it is cleped in vertue excellence, A wight to lyue in humble pacience. Be not to scant, be not to prodigall, Conserue thy thing gotten with laboure: It is full fayre, to be sayd liberall, But eschewe wast, and be no surfetoure, Consume not all thy treasure in an houre, whan of thy laboure ryseth none auayle: Nedy pouerte muste the full sone assayle. Be not lyke zenola, for he woulde ete With euery man, &amp; at their feest him fede: But neuer man, might tasten of his mete, No man to him, but he to al men yede. Be free of mete, but loke y? largesses lede The no ferther, than thou may well attain. be thin own fr?d, for this saith cato certain Take hede sir, howe holsomly this clerke Entreateth men by vertuos doctrine Thys fyrst part of his compendious werke In worship how thei shal ful clerely shine, Guyding to renowne streght as any lyne: whose preceptes obserue if ye list, And to his good co?sail, your hertes encline Right in your welth ful wel it shal be wist The vertues foure, y? men shold forth c?uey Lo in this life, as brydel doth a beeste, That men not erre in this perilous waye, Stablisshinge him as doth a stedfast reest. As sikur guydes, y? ben worthyest Mannes lyuing to sette in gouernaunce, This sage Cato, full wysely doth regest, Prenteth his sawes in your remembra?ce. Here foloweth the second booke of Cato. If thou my chylde sette thy delyte, Of earth, to knowe the tilthe and culture, And if thou wilt of knowledge be perfite. Why some is areable, and some is pasture, And why some is spreint w? floure picture, I counsayle the to musen for a whyle, In the laureat poete virgile. And further more my chylde, if that the list, The vertue of herbes for to discriue: It may neuer in earth better be wyst, Whiche be c?suming, whiche be nutritiue, Whiche hote, whiche colde, whiche conseruatiue: Th? rede Macer, in his olde dite, Whiche telleth hem in proper qualite. And if thou haue desirous fresh courage, To here of noble Romains worthinesse, How that thei vanquished theim of cartage, And many other, through manly prowesse: Than rede Lucan, full well can he expresse, who bare him best in towne &amp; eke in felde, and who did marueiles vnder macers shelde And he that lust of louers for to rede, And in that wyse him selfe to auaunce, As in y? craft, Naso can teache him spede. Some loueth song, some harpe, lute &amp; da?ce Some other thynges diuers of pleasaunce, Some louen secretly &amp; lust not to be spide, Som wil be know? for thus writeth Ouide But yet my chylde if that in aduenture, Thyne hert be set to no such maner thyng: Or if it be not all to thy pleasure That Uirgil, Macer, Lucan, &amp; Naso bring, yet that thou may be wyse in thy liuyng. If the lust to geue me audience, I shall the shewe doctrine of sapience. Therfore my chylde, come to me and lere, And I shal the shew the veray treasure Of sapience, if the lust to here. And how thou shalt, in good estate endure, And lede thy lyfe after goddes pleasure. Therfore come nere, &amp; ?lern? by this reding, To be a man vertuous in lyuyng. There is no wight, that further may report Of thy good dedes, than the stra?ger may. Make him good chere, &amp; shew h? thi disport: And he shal vtter thy name, this is no nay, For the vnknowen, sometime doth assay. Frendes ynowe to haue, is better thyng, Than is frendles, a man to be a kyng. Of goddes misterie and his working, Make neuer my chylde to far inquiraunce, It is foly to muse vpon suche thyng. Dispute neuer thy goddes pouruiaunce, All thyng must be vnder his gouernaunce. Sithe thou art man clad in mortalite, Dispute thou thynges suche as mortal be. The drede of death, that is inordinate, I meane to drede it ay, and neuer to cese. Beware of that I counseyle the algate, For this is as gospel doubtles True, who dredeth so, is ay myrthles. Whan drede of death a man so aggruggith, It wasteth life, and his tyme abbruggith. For thyng that is to the uncertayne, Whan thou art wrath, loke y? neuer striue. Thy pacience easely withdrawe &amp; refrayne, For there is no persone in earth on lyue, But that all reasonlesse he is as blyue, As besy wrath hath kyndled hym on fyre: And than he can not deme the trouth for yre As tyme requireth, so make thine expence, Mesure thy hand, after thy properte Of thyng, of tyme, and after the presence. Se that thou spende no more than nedeth y?, And that to spende, loke thyne hert be fre. A man shuld do coste, &amp; make his spending, Considering time, &amp; rewarding the thyng. To muche is nought of any maner thyng, The meane is good and moost c?mendable, Than m? standeth surest here in his liuing with mene estate that halt him greable. Plente and pouerte be not souffrable, For than is the shippe in the sea moste sure, whan that the flode excedith not mesure. If y? know ought y? may turne one to shame, Kepe it secrete for nothing it bewrye: Be not to besy suche thynges to proclame And publisshe, as thou knowest priue. Make not all men, to gare on the and crye, Lest mo depraue, wh? y? word has sowe that was before to other men vnknowe. Yf thou espse and see a surfetoure, A thefe, a shrewe, of grete mysgouerna?ce. Trust well sumtyme, shal come an houre whan for his dede, shall he suffre penaunce, Cursed dede, askyth wreche and vengeance Though wyckydnesse for time be kept secre Yet at the last it wol discouerd bee. Though sum tyme nature haue ben vnkind And yeuen a man to be of smale stature, Yet my chylde Remembre, &amp; haue in mynde That thou neuer dispice that creature, for god may send hym fortune and good our As ofte as thay be w? good counsell allied, To wh? y? nature, hath great str?ght denied whan the hapenyth to trauerce or haue ado w? him thou knowest not egal to thy myght, Thyne vttrest power shew not such on vnto lest that eftsones, he haue the in like plight for it is synne in tournement and in sight. fortune changith oftene in an hour And he is discomfet, that erst was victoure. Of br?des smale, be made these fires grete, withdrawe y? brand, the fire shal eke decrece Agayne the knowen ayre loke y? neuer bete with wordes fele, for word distourbeth pece. The man is wyse, that can of wordes cese, For this is soth as god gaf the lyfe, Of wordes smale, is brad full muche stryfe. Dele not with sorcery, ne with surquedry: In goddes hand is all thy sorte and state, Be not about to calcle thy destyny, If thou be mysbrous or fortunate. Let god alone, in him is all thy state, And that hym list of the for to purpose: without the, ful well can he dispose. Beware of enuy, with her taches felle, within thyne hert, loke that she not reste: For it is one of the paynes of helle whan she soiourneth in a mans breste, Than brenneth fenix in his owne neste. and though she may non other m? mischeue Yet Ethua ceaseth not her selfe to greue. Enforce thyne hert, with manly suffra?ce, Though iudgement agaynst the procede, Be not abasshed in worde ne countena?ce. For the oppressoure, fals may rule and lede, The lawe, but trust me well without drede, Long to reioyse acheueth he nat, whiche by meanes vntrew, his goodes gat. Wrath of olde, that should be out of mynde, Be not about to make eft alyue. But the enuious hath that tache of kynde. Such malice my child, loke y? neuer reuiue, For yre of old, maketh men to stryue. and who remembreth olde enemyte: A wicked man, forsoth my chylde is he. Thy selfe also, loke that thou not preyse, Ne dispreyse, but let other men alone. Alway after prudence thy wordes y? peyse: For thine own aua?t, honour getest y? none But a mocke, anone as thou art gone. A man to preyse him selfe as sayth the scole, Or dispreyse muche, is token of a fole. Whan it is time of coste and gret expence, Beware of waste and spend ay by mesure. who that to kepe nor spende no difference Maketh, his goodes may not long endure. The olde sawe sayth, mesure is tresure: For in short tyme, thy good may slyp away, That was begotten in many a sondry day. It is no wisdome, alway to seme sage, But sometyme to be nyce, and fayne folye: who hath this feate shall fynde auauntage. whan tyme and thyng requireth that espye, And than to dissimyle it is pollicye: Sometyme me to be vnwyse in apparance Among the wyse, is called hygh prudence. Thy filthy fleshe in mouyng bestial, That fyghteth against the soule within By force of her entycement sensuall, Eschew my chyld, &amp; kepe the from her gyn: That acte, &amp; grace, be set full ferre atwyne. And fle of auarice the wicked fame, This two it be, that causen euyll name. Beleue not euery wyghtes sawe, For some reporte thynges all otherwyse Than it was done, or any man it sawe. And some haue it of custome and of gyse, To fede folke with flatteryng and lyese. Geue litle trust therfore to such spekynges: For many folke speke many thynges. If thou surfet in drynke, forget not that, Auyse the oft thou come not in the snare. withdraw thy h?d, fede not thy throte so fat Drinke that suffiseth, &amp; otherwhile y? spare. To muche drynke maketh men of wit bare, And yet the wyne therof is not to blame. But the drynker, maketh hym selfe lame. To thy trusty frende that is ay seere, Shewe thy co?sayl, to hym thy hert bewry, A trusty frend is chefest of preuete. But it is hard suche frendes to espie, Trie out one among a companie, And of thy body betake the cure: To suche a leche, as is trusty and sure. Within thy selfe, agreue the not to sore, Though thyng amys sumtyme the betyde. Dismay the not in besy wyse therfore, Thyne aduenture nedes thou must abyde, Fortune may not alway be on thy syde. with harmes to greue, in awayte lieth she, To reue men of their felicite. In thy selfe compasse about before, Thynge to perceyue, that after shall befall. It noyeth not, ne greueth halfe so sore, That is forsayne, as other thynges shall, Sodeyne chaunces disseysen moste of all. It hurteth lesse, and is better plyght: wherof before a man can haue in syght. Whan diuers thinges trauers thyne ent?t And thou art wrapped in aduersite: wayte for w?hope, thou be not lost ne shent. Let not dispayre thy wyt bereue the, Abyde the tyme it may better be. Hope is she that shall make the a seth, Hope leueth not man, though m? leue breth Whan profer is than mekely it receyue, Take thynges whyle they be in season. They profre now, y? oft wil thinges weyne. Plente now, wyl afterwarde be geason. Take in tyme, for so commaundeth reason. The balled head, sumtyme full of heres, Now is made bare without knife or sheres. Prouide thy selfe, and haue deliueraunce By lykely coniecture what may betyde, Aduertise my chyld in thy remembraunce Afore and after about on euery syde. Folowe that god, and let hym be thy guyde, That all thyng hath in his gouernement, Future passed and that is present. It is a tache, of a deuouryng hounde To receyue superflue and done excesse: Till his receyte fr? hym agayne rebounde. Content thy nature, and fle gredynesse: Foule lustes ay kepe vnder and represse. Fede not thy lust withall that she wil craue If in helth thou lust thy body to saue. Whan a multitude hath geuen a decre, Or concluded ought agaynst thyne entent, Trauerse not against the communete: For if thou do thou shalt lyghtly be shente. Despyse not alone the peples iudgemente, In aduenture thou please of them not one: while thou wilt enpugne ?them;? euerichone. Take good hede vnto thyne owne estate, To rule thy body well with good diete. But loke with tyme, thou be not at debate. though through thin own misrule &amp; surfete: Sekenes &amp; sorowe, haue geuen the an hete, The tyme is good, and no dismale it is: But man it maketh, for that he doth amys. Drede no dremes, so saith Detronomye, Though they be caused of complection, Or els of any nyced fantasye, Or of a superflue replection: For dremes be but fals illusion. wh? men be wakyng, they desire &amp; thinke, And vp? suche thing, they dreme whan they wynke. Lenuoye. Museth a whyle, what al these maters mene Abyde my mayster and go no further yet, To rede theim, auayleth not a bene: But if a man the curnel wyll vnknit. wherfore your hert, &amp; al your mynd vnshit, And loke what lieth vnder y? boistous rinde, And I dare say, of wysdome and of wyt, Plente and foyson, therin shall ye fynde. Refressheth your selfe, w? this holsome diet That fostereth and kepeth vertue on lyue. To your parsone me thynketh it full mete: For to receyue suche a nutritiue. whiche youre estate, shal ay preserue alyue. In great honour, &amp; kepe you fr? noyssa?ce, Out of daunger and vices infectiue: If ye wyll worche, after this ordinaunce. And in especiall, loke that your dede, May bere true wytnesse and testifie. The mater that ye beholde and rede. Loke w? your herte, as wel as w? your eye, Than dare I say, somewhat shal ye espie, that to this worke shal moue your courage. wherfore your hert, your eie, &amp; al applie, your selfe to rule, after this dietes sage. Secunda pars finita. Here folowed the third booke of Cato. Beholde what wyght, that lust for to rede In this my diete, somewhat shall he fynde, where w?, his soule he shall foustre and fede, with the wyse good, and it fr? vices bynde. Come nere my child therfore &amp; haue in m?d, Suche doctrine to bere away and lere, As to thy lyfe shalbe full good and dere. Thy soule resembleth, a newe playne table, In the whiche, as yet apperith no picture, The philosophie saith without fable: So is the soule but a dedly figure, Till tyme she be reclaymed with the lure Of doctrine, and so get her a good habite To be expert in conyng and parfite. Enprynte my teching, in thy soule stedfast, And full profitable thou shalt it fynde Forsake it not, ne from thyn hert it cast For if thou do exclude out of thy mynde This lesson, thou art full bareyn and blinde From vertu, and therfore wyte not me, Sith the faute my sonne, is then in the, Yf thou lyue Iustly, keping the vpright Neuer declining for nede ne fauoure, Than standest thou in a full holsom plight, Though m? malingne w? wordes of rigour Yf thou liue thus, thy good lyfe is thy toure We may not let, the people to gare &amp; crye: But doo we wel, if they say misse they lye.

He can anoynte softly thy eres twayne, With oyle of plesaunce plente and foison. Yet vnder that, kepe the from his poyson. Slouth, slogardy, and dulle ydulnesse, And lachesse, that causith to be necligente, Eschue my child with all thy besynesse: For ydull body, makith the soul shente. There is in erth no greater argumente, For to conclude the body vnapte: Than that the soule in ydelnesse be wrapte. Who so lackith rest, may not long endure: Therfore among take thin ease and disport. Delite the neuer in besinesse and cure, But yet at sumtyme thou maist resort To play, recreacion, and comforte, Thou shalte the better laboure at the long, Whan thou hast mirth, thi besinesse am?g, It is ful hard, to plese euery wight, Despreyse no m?nes dedes, nor them lacke, Ne wordys, for euen so right, As thou dispraisist them behind thy backe Right so wil m? make y? a moppe &amp; a knacke The contrary, though men had it sworne, The scorner shall alwaye haue a scorne. Whan thy last sorte that sum men call fate, Is good and pleasaunt after thyne entente: This meane I loo, wh? thou art fortunate, Receiue the good that god hathe to the sente Suffre it not rechelesly to be spent For th? of a wastour, shalt thou haue y? n?e For our great riot, wil cause a feble fame.

Wed not a wyfe for her inheritaunce, For she will cast it ofte in thy berde. And yf she be noyus and full of greuaunce, Constrayne her not tabyde in thy yerde, Of chastise ment she is a cursed wede, To kepe one that will the ay atwite, He is at ease, that of suche one is quyte. Of other men thy mirrour thou shalt make Conforme the to that, y? most men appreue, What y? shalt do, &amp; what thou shalt forsake, A better lesson maist thou not contreue, Than to other mennes dedes releue. In all apperteyneth vnto thy teching, Make other men a rule for thy lyuing.

Therfore my sonne bring it in audience, That thou apperceiuest not well done is: Lest for thy silence men deme of the amys. Whan that the lawe is strayte &amp; rigorous, Entreate the iudge to shewe the fauoure, Enclynyng him for to be gratious. An egall iudge, may the parcas socoure, And yet the lawe, shall be his gouernoure. whiche he ought, sometime to modifie: As in the case, he may a poynt espie.

Nature can with litle thing be content, As indiete, a man should neuer charge Him selfe with mete, for many m? ben shent: For their receites be so greate and large. Men se alday the litle bote and barge, wyl drenche anone wh? they be ouerfreght: Cherisshe nature, but hurt her not w? weght If thy thing thou happe to misgouerne. without reason or any prouidence, Than my childe of me this lesson lerne: Sithe it was thy fortune suche expence To make, but wyte it thyne own neglig?ce. for fortune may neuer compelle the, Thy good to spende but at thy liberte. Loue thy peny, as for thy cheuissaunce, Not for the coigne, to hoorde it on an hepe. For of the prynte, was made an ordyna?ce, Not for it shuld in cofres ly and slepe, But for it shuld among the people lepe In thaire eschaunge, and who it kepith inne As for the forme, is subiect vnto sinne. Whan thou hast plente, and arte pecunyal I meane whan thou hast great suffisaunce Of mony, foyson, and of helth but smalle Than spend thy mony, and thy self avaunce Kepe not thy coygne, and liue in greuaunce, The sicke, hath syluer in full great excesse, But of him selfe, he hath no likernesse. Though somtime y? suffre great sharpnes Of beeting, yet thy maistre is chastissement Take well in gre with lowly humblenes, Sith it is do but all in good entente, To cause the to learne, &amp; wisdome for to h?te And though his wordes sowne full of ire: Yet suffer thou thy talant of thy desire. Also my chyld, thou shalt the occupie To worke thynges that ben profitable But loke thy wittes thou neuer applye, To thing that may not be vaillable To cast a thynge that is not pregnable By wyt or strength, it is but greate errour. Dispaired hope, is ende of suche laboure, wh? thou shalt geue th? geue in fr?dlywise, frendly content a prayre or Requeste for geuen in tyme, is geuen twyse, Sith gladsom chere, makith giftes Richeste who so geueth gladly &amp; sone geueth beeste, Loo no thing may frendes better conquere, Than man to leue that he may forbere. whan a thynge thou haste in a coniecture As in the conceyte, holdyng it suspecte To discusse that thing anon do thy cure for at the furst whan such thynges is reiecte The rest is aftir easy to correct. And thyng that at the furst is not set by, Is often sayne to greue fynally. And whan thou arte disposed inwardly. To venus actes, than represse thy courage, Fostre not thy flesshe to lustily. For great dyet, makith the flesshe outrage, Where as measure might cause it to swage And glotony, is clepud cheife pometrice, Ledinge the flesshe, to wantannesse &amp; vice. The rampand Lyon &amp; the Tygre felle, The yrous Bore, the hounde ful of enuye, And other beestes moo than nedeth to telle, Men dreden sore, and feren their tirannye, And will they doo but yit one beest I spye, That is to fere moste in speciale: Man is the beest; y? thou moste drede shall. The vertue that is clepud fortitude Standith not all in strengthes bodily, As to be virous, mighty, strong and rude, But in the soule, it must be sikurly. Than if thou wylt thy self fortefie Thy soule within acqueynt w? sapient: And th? shalt thou be strong in existence. what thing in erth thou shalt take on hande And thy supporte, shal be in frendlynesse, No straunger on lyue so nigh to y? wil st?de As thy knowen fr?d, my child this is expres Of the straunger thou hast no likernesse. For whan all other ben full far to seche: Thy faithfull fr?d, can best th? be thy leche The deth of bestes that be vnresonable, As be custum and right of sacryfice To purge the is no seth greable. Trust not so to gete thy reprice, For they that trusten so be full vnwise. By deth of bestes god will not quemed bee. And man abyde in his iniquitee Whan y? wolte chose a frende for trustines, Than of his fortune make no Inquirance: For fortune is mother of changeablenes, Aske of his lyfe and of his gouernaunce: For that is proue of greater suffisaunce. Than vre of fortune that is casuelle, For lyfe of man his fortune doth excelle. Use wel the richesse that thou hast by quest Of auarice the wicked name escheue, Let not thy good be stopped in a cheste? Kepe not thy stuffe ay closed stil in mewe? Such old treasour wil make thy sh?e newe. what proufiteth plenty, or great treasoure.

In all thy ioye reeste and prosperitie, Thinke thou parcas aduersite wil cese: For welth standith not in sekernesse, And also sone whan any aduersitese, Assautith the, yet fall not into dispaire: Think in thy helpe, good fort?e may repair It is full fayre my child, to be prudente, And wisely loke thou lerne therfore. To lerne ay my sonne do thyn entente, By diligent besynes, wisdome is more: wisdome is she, that may not be forbore The rather prudence, y? folke nyce refuse. Can not be had but by processe and vse, Beware alway that thou neuer enhaunce, In thy laude or praysing a wight to hie: For thou maist haue cause eft to disaua?ce The same: but ay thy praising modefie. For at one day, thou shalt ful wel espye whether he be frendly that frendly semyth: For all be not frendes, that men demyth. Be not ashamed also my chylde to lere, That thou can not for it is a teche Of folye: not to desyre doctryne to here. Full wel is he that to conning may streche, Sith conyngles a man is but a wreche. To knowe muche, is right commendable, And nought to knowe, is ay reproueable. The solleyne styll oft meneth fraud &amp; gyle, Of suche a man escheue the company For the stil man compassith otherwhile within his hert, deceyte and trecherye. In flodes stil is water depe and hye, In stremes softe seming to thy plesaunce, Often betidith, full vnhappy chaunce, With thy fortune wh? thou arte disc?tente And canst not take agre thyne aduenture, Behold and fele in thyn auisemnete, How thay sumtyme were as thou as sure, And more likely in welth for to endure. Bothe of beaute and eke of noblenesse: Haue yet fallen downe into wrechednesse. Atempte no thyng, that y? maist not suffice, Passe not thi might, bere not to hie thy saile For ther is parrell, yf that the streme arise, Certayne my child, this without faile, The vessel small, is at ful great auaile, Whan with his Ore he may to land reche where the sailes hie ful oft? gone to wreche Against y? true Iust m?, brawle not ne striue For to god aboue, that is great displesa?ce, Trust this truly, ther is no man on lyue, That to the iuste m? doth dere or greua?ce, But at the last god wil take vengeaunce. And herof it is good hede for to take, The rightwisman, of god is not forsake. Yf extorcion or misauenture, Haue plucked at the and made y? thredbare Of riches yet do thy force and cure, Being mery and eschue thought and care. For freting thought, is a ful cursed snare: Come not therin, fortune is vnstable, After pouerte, riches is pregnable. Uenus is redy, with al hir actes vile. wh? he bacchus, hath sent hir in largesse, The tresoure of his hote and feruent Ile. Therfore my chield thyne appetyt represse, In wynes hote, do not to great excesse. Drinke that for thy soule is expedient, Eschue strif, with mesure be cont?te. It is an harme, thy goodes to forgo. That bene in hand, by force or violence, But yet my childe thou muste c?sidre who, And what he is, that dothe the such offence. Bitwixt frend and fo, haue ay a diffrence. For in sum caas, thou must a frend forbere, And suffre him, though he annoye &amp; dere. Be not to sure that thou shalt lyue long, A wight shal die be he loth or leef. And as the olde so die the yong among, Deth stelith on, as doth a priue theef. Lo aganyst deth, men fynd noo releefe She is aboute to make a deuorce, And folowith ay the shadowe of the corce. Serue ay thy god w? lowly obseruaunce, w? hert entier, with sote smelling encence, Such sacrifice, is moste to his plesaunce. Of calues smale that neuer did offence, Though thou them sle, thay not dispence with y?, let th? groue &amp; swinke in thy plough Thy hert to god is sacrifice ynough. Geue place to him that excedeth thy myght, Though y? be hurt it may profit percha?ce. and seld auayleth a man for to fight against suche one as passeth his puissaunce, Though he greue now, yet oft he may au?ce Full oft is sayne after greate duresse, The mighty man will kithe his gentilnesse. After thy surfet and greate offence, Chastise thy selfe correct that was amys, Correcte thy gylte, amende thy necligence. Sorowe for sinne, a veray medicine is Repente the sore, than arte thou saufe iwis. For phisicke saith, my chyld I the ensure: a bitter drinke, y? sharpe sickenes may cure. If y? haue founde long frendship in a wight. Ful yore ago, though he begyn to chaunge Dispraise him not: m? bide not in one plight sometime was abbay, there as now is gr?ge This worlds cours, is w?dre queinte &amp; stra?ge. but though y? m?, now be waxe vnkind: His olde frendshyp remembre in thy mynd. If it vre the in office to be sette, Than be thou gracious to other men They may reporte a godly man is mette with suche an office, &amp; so good name shal r?ne: About of the, but I ensure the whenne. The officers are vnkinde, than say y? presse Now wold god, this man were officelesse. Be not suspecte, that is a wicked teche, The suspecte wight, with coward Iolasy, In his liuing is but a very wretche, Muche is amys, and all wold he espy, Ne demeth false and faileth hertinesse. His false conceite sette in malyncolye Sleeth him anone: deth endeth his folye. If thou haue men without libertie, Suche as men clepe the men of bondage, Though they be vnder thy captiuitie, yet to suche men be neuer so outrage, If they be holden vnder thy seruage. Though they be bo?de yet veray m? thei be: And so to dele with theim, &amp; remembre the. Thy first fortune receiue with redinesse, Refuse it not though it be scant and smal. It is well better in gree to take the lesse, Than refuse it, and after fayle of all. Giftes of fortune take theim as they fall. Forsake them now, &amp; oft thou shalt th? nede: Tyme is to take when men proffer &amp; bede. Reioyce not my chyld in all thy lyfe, The sodeine death of a cursed m? or wretche whan he is dead, the soule may not reuyue, Fr? paine to ioye, y? sprite may not stretche, The fyndes holde so sore y? they may retche. who lyueth well full well eke dieth he: That soule is sure of greate felicite. If thou haue a wyfe in assuraunce, Than trust her wel, and loue her inwardly, with hert &amp; thought &amp; all thy affiaunce, Be not infecte with suspect Ielosy: If no defaute in her thou canst spie. And if thy frende tel the suche is the fame: He is a frende and she nothing to blame, Whan through studie and long exercise, Thou knowest muche &amp; hast great c?ning, yet do thy diligence, in besy wyse, More to cunne it is a holsome thyng. To greate honour, conning may the bring. And neuer eschewe for to wille be caught, without teaching, sci?ce will not be taught. And if y? ought maruayle, or lust for to muse, In naked wordes why my verses I wryte, In no wyse I may me better excuse, Than say my witte so dulle &amp; inparfite, Artith me thus rudely to endite. By two and two, my metre for to knytte, Nought causeth me, but simplenes of witte. Pars quarta et vltima. Whan I aduertise in my rem?braunce, And se how many folke erre greuously In the way of vertuous gouerna?ce: I haue supposed in my selfe that I, Ought to supporte and couusaill prudently Theim to be full glorious in lyuyng, and how thei shold the selfe in honour bring. Therfore my chylde I shall teche the, Herken me well, the maner and the guyse, How thy soule inward shall acqueinted be with the goode and vertuous in al wyse, Rede an conceyue, for he to dispice, that redith ay &amp; wote not what is mente: Suche redyng is nought but wynde spente. Prayse thy god &amp; pray him with al thy hert, Father &amp; mother haue thou in reuerence, Loue them wel, &amp; be thou neuer to smert To here mens counsail but kepe the thence Til thou be called, be clene without offence, Salue gladly to theim that be more digne than y? thy selfe, thou shalt thy place resigne. Drede thy maister, thy thing loke thou kepe Take hede to thy houshold, ay loue thy wife, Pleasa?t wordes out of thy mouth let crepe, Be not Irous, kepe thy behest as lyfe, Be tempred with wyne, but not to excessite, Thy wyues worde make none auctorite. In foly, slepe no more than nedeth the. In goodly bokes sometyme shalt thou rede, And that thou redist in thy mynde it shitte, Stirre no wight to wrath, lye not I y? reede Do wel to good, and that wil oft be quitte, Be not wicked ne to the wicked knitte, Stande in the place of pleting exercise, Deme the ryght, be counseyted of the wyse. Play with a top, the dice loke thou eschewe, Dispise not women, kepe theim thy behest, Scorne neuer wight, for th? y? shalt it rewe, Couet no mans good, speake fewe at feste, Loke thy vengea?ce be euer w? the leste, who hath done y? good haue in rem?bra?ce, Loue euery wight, &amp; this shall the auaunce. Trie before you trippe.</field>
