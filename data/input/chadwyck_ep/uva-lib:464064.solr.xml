The soft morow ande The lustee Aperill, The wynter set, the stormys in exill, Quhen that the brycht &amp; fresch illumynare Uprisith arly in his fyre chare His hot courss in to the orient, And frome his spere his goldine stremis sent Wpone the grond, in maner off mesag, One euery thing to valkyne thar curage, That natur haith set wnder hire mycht, Boith gyrss, and flour, &amp; euery lusty vicht; And namly thame that felith the assay Of lufe, to schew the kalendis of may, Throw birdis songe with opine wox one hy, That sessit not one lufaris for to cry, Lest thai for?het, throw slewth of Ignorans, The old wsage of lowis obseruans. And fro?e I can the bricht face asspy, It deuit me no langare fore to ly, Nore that loue schuld sleuth In to me finde, Bot walkine furth, bewalinge in my mynde The dredful lyve endurit al to longe, Sufferans in loue of sorouful harmys stronge, The scharpe dais and the hewy ?erys, Quhill phebus thris haith passith al his speris, Vithoutine hope ore traistinge of comfort; So be such meine fatit was my sort. Thus in my saull Rolinge al my wo, My carful hart carwing ca? In two The derdful suerd of lowis hot dissire, So be the morow set I was afyre In felinge of the access hot &amp; colde, That haith my hart in sich a fevir holde, Only to me thare was no?e vthir ess Bot thinkine qhow I schulde my lady pless. The scharp assay and ek the Inwart peine Of dowblit wo me neulyngis ca? constrein, Quhen that I have remembrit one my thocht How sche, quhois bewte al my har? haith wrocht, Ne knouith not how I ame wo bego?e, Nor how that I ame of hire seruandis o?e; And in my self I ca? nocht fynde the meyne In to quhat wyss I sal my wo compleine. Thus in the feild I walkith to &amp; froo, As thochtful wicht that felt of nocht bot woo, Syne to o gardinge, that wess weil bese?, Of quiche the feild was al depaynt with gre?. The tendyre and the lusty flouris new Up thr?ue the gre? vpone thar stalkis grew A?hane the sone, and thare levis spred, Quharwith that al the gardinge was Iclede, That pryapus, in to his tyme before, In o lustear walkith nevir more; And al about enweronyt and Iclosit One sich o wyss, that none within supposit Fore to be se? with ony vicht thare owt, So dide the levis clos it all about. Thar was the flour, thar was the que? alphest, Rycht wering being of the nychtis rest, Wnclosing ga?e the crownel for the day; The brycht sone illumynit haith the spray, The nychtis sobir ande the most schowris, As cristoll terys withhong vp[o]ne the flouris, Haith vpwarpith In the lusty aire, The morow makith soft, ameyne, and faire; And the byrdis thar mychty voce out throng, Quhill al the wood resonite of thar songe, That gret confort till ony vicht It wer That plessith thame of lustenes to here; Bot gladness til the thochtful, auer mo The more he seith, the more he haith of wo. Thar was the garding with the flouris ourfret, Quich is in posy fore my lady set, That hire Represent to me oft befor, &amp; thane also; thus al day gan be sor Of thocht my gost with torment occupy, That I beca?e In to one exasy, Ore slep, or how I wot, bot so befell, My wo haith done my livis gost expell, And in sich wiss weil long I can endwr, So me betid o wondir aventur. As I thus lay, Rycht to my spreit vas se? A birde, yat was as ony lawrare gre?, Alicht, and sayth in to hir birdis chere; âO woful wrech, that levis in to were! To schew the thus the god of loue me sent, That of thi seruice no thing is content, For in his court yhoue lewith in disspar, And vilfully sustenis al thi care, And schapith no thinge of thine awn remede, Bot clepith ay and cryith apone dede; Yhow callith the birdis be morow fro thar bouris, Yhoue devith boith the erbis and the flouris, And clepit hyme vnfaithful king of lowe, Yow dewith hyme in to his rigne abuse, Yhow tempith hyme, yhoue doith thi self no gud, Yhoue art o mo? of wit al destitude. Wot yhoue nocht that al liwis creatwre Haith of thi wo in to hir hand the cwre? And set yhoue clep one erbis and one treis, Sche heris not thi wo, nore ?hit sche seis; For none may know the dirkness of thi thocht, Ne blamyth her, thi wo sche knowith nocht, And It is weil accordinge It be so. He suffir harme, that to redress his wo Previdith not; for long ore he be fonde, Holl of his leich, that schewith not his vound. And of owid ye autor schall yhow knaw Of lufe that seith, for to consel or schow, The last he clepith althir best of two; And that is suth, and sal be euer mo. And loue also haith chargit me to say, Set yhoue presume, ore beleif, ye assay Of his seruice, as It wil ryne ore go, Preswme It not, fore It wil not be so; Al magre thine a seruand schal yow bee. And as tueching thine aduersytee, Complen and sek of the ramed, the cwre, Ore, gif yhow likith, furth thi wo endure.â And, as me thocht, I ansuerde a?ai?e Thus to the byrde, in wordis schort and plane: âIt ganyth not, as I have harde Recorde, The seruand for to disput with ye lord; Bot well he knowith of al my vo the quhy, And in quhat wyss he hath me set, quhar I Nore may I not, nore can I not attane, Nore to hir hienes dare I not complane.â âFul!â quod the bird, âlat be thi nyss dispare, For in this erith no lady is so fare, So hie estat, nore of so gret empriss, That in hire self haith visdome ore gentrice, Yf that o wicht, that worthy is to be Of lovis court, schew til hir that he Seruith hire in lovis hartly wyss, That schall thar for hyme hating or dispiss. The god of love thus chargit the, at schort, That to thi lady yhoue thi wo Report; Yf yhoue may not, thi plant schall yhov vrit. Se, as yhoue cane, be maner ofe endit In metir, quhich that no man haith susspek, Set oft tyme thai contenyng gret effece; Thus one sume wyss yhow schal thi wo dwclar. And, for thir sedulis and thir billis are So generall, and ek so schort at lyte, And swme of thaim is lost the appetit, Sum trety schall yhoue for yi lady sak, That wnkouth is, als tak one hand and mak, Of love, ore armys, or of sum othir thing, That may hir one to thi Remembryng brynge, Qwich soundith Not one to no hewynes, Bot one to gladness and to lusteness, That yhoue belevis may thi lady pless, To have hir thonk and be one to hir ess; That sche may wit in seruice yhow art one. Faire weil,â quod sche, âthus schal yhow the dispone, And mak thi self als mery as yhoue may, It helpith not thus fore to wep al way.â With that, the bird sche haith hir leif tak, For fere of quich I can onone to wak; Sche was ago, and to my self thocht I Quhat may yis meyne? quhat may this signify? Is It of troutht, or of Illusioune? Bot finaly, as in conclusioune, Be as be may, I schal me not discharge, Sen It apperith be of lovis charg; And ek myne hart no?e othir bissynes Haith bot my ladice seruice, as I gess; Among al vtheris I schal one honde tak This litil occupatioune for hire sak. Bot hyme I pray, the mychty gode of loue, That sitith hie in to his spir abuf, (At command of o wyss quhois visioune My gost haith takin this opvnioune,) That my lawboure may to my lady pless, And do wnto hir ladeschip sum ess, So that my trauell be nocht tynt; and I Quhat vtheris say setith no thing by, For wel I know that, be this worldis fa?e, It schal not be bot hurting to my na?e, Quhen that thai here my febil negligens, That empit is, and bare of eloquens, Of discressioune, and ek of Retoryk; The metire and the cuning both elyk So fere discording frome perfeccioune; Quhilk I submyt to the correccioune Of yaim the quhich that is discret &amp; wyss, And enterit is of loue in the seruice; Quhich knouyth that no lovare dare withstonde, Quhat loue hyme chargit he mot tak one honde, Deith, ore defa?, or ony maner wo; And at this tyme with me It stant rycht so, As I that dar makine no demande To quhat I wot It lykith loue commande. Tueching his chargis, as with al destitut, Within my mynd schortly I conclud For to fulfyll, for ned I mot do so. Thane in my thocht rolling to and fro Quhare that I mycht sum wnkouth mater fynde, Quhill at ye last it fell in to my mynd Of o story, that I befor had sene, That boith of loue and armys can conte?, Was of o knycht clepit lancelot of ye laik, The sone of bane was king of albanak; Of quhois fame &amp; worschipful dedis Clerkis in to diuerss bukis redis Of quhome I thynk her sumthing for to writ At louis charge, and as I cane, endit; Set men tharin sal by experiens Know my consait, and al my negligens. Bot for that story is so pasing larg, One to my wit It war so gret o charg For to translait the romans of that knycht, It passith fare my cunyng and my mycht, Myne Ignorans may It not comprehende; Quharfor thare one I wil me not depend How he was borne, nor how his fader deid And ek his moder, nore how he was denyed Efter thare deth, presumyng he was ded, Of al ye lond, nore how he fra that stede In sacret wyss wnwyst away was tak, And nwrist with ye lady of ye lak. Nor, in his ?outh, think I not to tell The auentouris, quhich to hyme befell; Nor how the lady of the laik hyme had One to the court, quhare that he knycht was mad; None wist his nome, nore how that he was tak By loue, and was Iwondit to the stak, And throuch &amp; throuch persit to ye hart, That al his tyme he couth It not astart; For thare of loue he enterit in seruice, Of wanore throuch the beute and franchis, Throuch quhois seruice in armys he has vrocht Mony wonderis, and perellis he has socht. Nor how he thor, in to his ?oung curage, Hath maid awoue, and in to louis rage, In the rewenging of o wondit knycht That cumyne was in to the court that nycht; In to his hed a brokin fuerd had he, And in his body also mycht men see The tronsioune of o brokine sper that was, Quhich no man out dedenyt to aras; Nor how he haith the wapnis out tak, And his awow apone this wis can mak, That he schuld hyme Reweng at his poware One euery knycht that louith the hurtare Better thane hyme, the quhich that was I wond. Throw quich awoue in armys hath ben founde The deth of mony wereoure ful wicht; For, fro tho wow was knowing of the knycht, Thare was ful mony o pasage in the londe By men of armys kepit to withstond This knycht, of quhome thai ben al set afyre Thaim to reweng in armys of desir. Nor how that thane incontynent was send He and sir kay togidder to defend The lady of nohalt, nore how that hee Gouernit hyme thare, nore in quhat degre. Nor how the gret pasing vassolag He escheuit, thr?ue the outragouss curag, In conquiryng of the sorowful castell. Nor how he passith doune in the cauis fell, And furth ye keys of Inchantment brocht, That al distroyt quhich that thare vas vrocht. Nore howe that he reskewit sir gawane, With his ix falouss in to presone tane; Nore mony vthere diuerss aduenture, Quhich to report I tak not in my cwre; Nor mony assemblay that gawane gart be maid To wit his name; nor how that he hyme hade Wnwist, and hath the worschip &amp; empriss; Nor of the knychtis in to mony diuerss wyss Throuch his awoue that hath thare dethis found; Nor of the sufferans that by louis wounde He in his trawel sufferith auer more; Nor in the quenis presens how tharfor By camelot, in to that gret Revare, He was ner dround. I wil It not declare How that he was in louis hewy thocht By dagenet in to the court Ibrocht; Nor how the knycht that tyme he cane perfew, Nor of the gyantis by camelot he slew; Nor wil I not her tell the maner how He slew o knycht, by natur of his wow, Off melyholt; nore how in to that toune Thar came one hyme o gret confusione Of pupil &amp; knychtis, al enarmyt, Nor how he thar haith kepit hyme wnharmyt; Nor of his worschip, nor of his gret prowes, Nor his defens of armys in the pres. Nor how the lady of melyhalt yat sche Came to the feild, and prayth hyme that he As to o lady to hir his suerd hath ?old Nor how he was in to hir keping hold; And mony vthir nobil deid also I wil report quharfor I lat ourgo. For quho thaim lykith for to specyfy, Of one of thaim mycht mak o gret story; Nor thing I not of his hye ren?wn My febil wit to makin mensioune; Bot of the weris that was scharp &amp; strong, Richt perellouss, and hath enduryt long, Of Arthur In defending of his lond Frome galiot, sone of the fair gyonde, That brocht of knychtis o pasing confluens; And how lancelot of arthuris hol defens And of the veris berith the renow?; And how he be the wais of fortoune Tuex the two princis makith the accorde, Of al there mortall weris to concorde; And how that venus, siting hie abuf, Reuardith hyme of trauell in to loue, And makith hyme his ladice grace to have, And thankfully his seruice cane resave; This is the mater quhich I think to tell. Bot stil he mot rycht with the lady duell, Quhill tyme cum eft that we schal of hym spek. This process mot closine be? and stek; And furth I wil one to my mater go. Bot first I pray, and I besek also, One to the most conpilour to support, Flour of poyetis, quhois nome I wil report To me nor to no? vthir It accordit, In to our rymyng his na? to be recordit; For sum suld deme It of presumpsioune, And ek our rymyng is al bot derysioune, Quhen that remembrit is his excellens, So hie abuf that stant in reuerans. Ye fresch enditing of his laiting toung Out throuch yis world so wid is yroung, Of eloquens, and ek of retoryk, Nor is, nor was, nore neuer beith hyme lyk, This world gladith of his suet poetry.

Quhen tytan, withe his lusty heit, Twenty dais In to the aryeit Haith maid his courss, and all with diuerss hewis Aparalit haith the feldis and the bewis, The birdis amyd the erbis &amp; the flouris, And one the branchis, makyne gone thar bouris, And be the morow singing in ther chere Welcum the lusty sessone of the ?ere. In to this tyme the worthi conqueroure Arthure, wich had of al this worlde the floure Of cheuelry anerding to his crown, So pasing war his knychtis in renoune, Was at carlill; and hapynnit so that hee Soiornyt well long in that faire cuntree. In to whilk tyme In to the court thai heire None awenture, for wich the knyghtis weire Anoit all at the abiding thare. For why, beholding one the sobir ayre And of the tyme the pasing lustynes, Can so thir knyghtly hartis to encress, That thei shir kay one to the king haith sende, Beseiching hyme he wold wichsaif to wende To camelot the Cetee, whare that thei Ware wont to heryng of armys day be day. The king forsuth, heryng thare entent, To thare desir, be schort awysment, Ygrantid haith; and so the king proponit And for to pas one hyme one the morne disponit. Bot so befell hyme that nycht to meit An aperans, the wich one to his spreit It semyth that of al his hed ye hore Of fallith and maid desolat; wharfore The king therof was pensyve in his mynd, That al the day he couth no resting fynde, Wich makith hyme his Iorneye to delaye. And so befell apone the thrid day, The bricht sone, pasing in the west, Haith maid his courss, and al thing goith to Rest; The king, so as the story can dewyss, He thoght a?eine, apone the samyne wyss, His vombe out fallith vith his hoil syde Apone the ground, &amp; liging hyme besid; Throw wich anon out of his slep he stert, Abasit and adred in to his hart. The wich be morow one to the qwen he told, And she a?eine to hyme haith ansuer ?olde; âTo dremys, sir, shuld no man have Respek, For thei ben thingis weyn, of non affek.â âWell,â quod the king, âgod grant It so befall!â Arly he ross, and gert one to hyme call O clerk, to whome that al his hewynes Tweching his drem shewith he express; Wich ansuer yaf and seith one to the kinge; âShir, no Record lyith to such thing; Wharfor now, shir, I praye yow tak no kep, Nore traist in to the vanyteis of slep, For thei are thingis that askith no credens, But causith of sum maner influens, Empriss of thoght ore superfleuytee, Or than sum othir casualytee.â â?it,â quod the king, âI sal nocht leif It so;â And furth he chargit mesingeris to go Throgh al his Realm, withouten more demande, And bad them stratly at thei shulde comande Al the bishopes, and makyng no delay The shuld appere be the tuenty day At camelot, with al thar hol clergy That most expert war, for to certefye A mater tueching to his gost be nyght. The mesag goith furth with the lettres Right. The king eft sone, within a litill space, His Iornay makith haith frome place to place, Whill that he cam to camelot; and there The clerkis all, as that the chargit were, Assemblit war, and came to his presens, Of his desir, to viting the sentens. To them that war to hyme most speciall Furth his entent shauyth he al hall; By whois conseil, of the worthiest He chesith ten, yclepit for the best, And most expert and wisest was supposit, To qwhome his drem all hail he haith disclossit, The houre, the nyght, and al the cercumstans, Besichyne them that the signifycans Thei wald hyme shaw, that he mycht resting fynde Of It, the wich that occupeid his mynde. And one of them with al ther holl assent Saith, âshire, fore to declare our entent Vpone this matere, ye wil ws delay Fore to awysing one to the ix day.â The king ther-to grantith haith, bot hee In to o place, that strong was and hye, He closith them, whare thei may no whare get, Vn to the day, the wich he to them set. Than goith the clerkis sadly to awyss Of this mater, to seing in what wyss The kingis drem thei shal best specefy. And than the maistris of astronomy The bookis longyne to ther artis set; Not was the bukis of arachell forget, Of nembrot, of dan?helome, thei two, Of moyses, &amp; of herynes all soo; And seking be ther calcolacioune To fynd the planetis disposicioune, The wich thei fond ware wonder ewill yset The samyne nyght the king his sweuen met. So ner the point socht thei have the thing, Thei fond It wonder hewy to the king, Of wich thing thei waryng in to were To shew the king, for dreid of his danger. Of ane accorde thei planly haue proponit No worde to show, and so thei them disponit. The day is cumyng, and he haith fore them sent, Besichyne them to shewing ther entent. Than spak they all, and that of an accorde; âShir, of this thing we can no thing Recorde, For we can noght fynd in til our sciens, Tweching this mater, ony ewydens.â âNow,â quod the king, âand be the glorius lorde, Or we depart ye shall sum thing recorde; So pas yhe uot, nor so It sall not bee.â âThan,â quod the clerkis, âgrant ws dais three.â The wich he grantid them, and but delay, The term passith, no thing wold the say, Wharof the king stondith heuy cherith, And to the clerkis his visag so apperith, That all thei dred them of the kingis myght.

The day is cum, the king haith them besocht, Bot one no wyss thei wald declar ther thoght; Than was he wroth in to his self and noyt, And maid his wow that thei shal ben distroyt. His baronis he commandit to gar tak Fyve of them one to the fir stak, And vther fyue be to the gibbot tone; And the furth with the kingis charg ar gone. He bad them in to secret wyss that thei Shud do no harm, but only them assey. The clerkis, dredful of the kingis Ire, And saw the perell of deth and of the fyre, Fyve, as thei can, has grantit to record; That vther herde and ben of ther accorde; And al thei ben yled one to the king, And shew hyme thus as tueching of this thing. âShir, sen that we constrenyt ar by myght To shaw wich that we knaw no thing aricht; For thing to cum preseruith It allan To hyme the wich is euery thing certa?, Excep the thing that til our knawleg hee Hath ordynat of certan for to bee; Therfor, shir king, we your magnificens Beseich It turne till ws to non offens, Nor hald ws nocht as learis, thoght It fall Not in this mater, as that we telen shall.â And that the king haith grantit them, &amp; thei Has chargit one, that one this wiss sall seye. âPresumyth, shir, that we have sundyne so; All erdly honore ye nedist most for-go, And them the wich ye most affy in tyll Shal failye ?ow, magre of ther will; And thus we haue in to this matere founde.â The king, qwhois hart was al wyth dred ybownd, And askit at the clerkis, if thei fynde By there clergy, that stant in ony kynde Of possibilitee, fore to reforme His desteny, that stud in such a forme: If in the hewyne Is preordynat On such o wiss his honor to translat.

He shawith outwart his contenans As he therof takith no greuans; But al the nyght it passid nat his thoght. The dais courss with ful desir he socht, And furth he goith to bring his mynd in rest With mony O knyght vn to the gret forest; The rachis gon wn-copelit for the deire, That in the wodis makith nois &amp; cheir; The knychtis, with the grewhundis in aweit, Secith boith the planis and the streit. Doune goith the hart, doune goith the hynd alfo; The swift grewhund, hardy of assay, Befor ther hedis no thing goith away. The king of hunting takith haith his sport, And to his palace home he can Resort, Ayan the noon; and as that he was set Vith all his noble knyghtis at the met, So cam ther in an agit knyght &amp; hee Of gret efstat semyt for to bee; Anarmyt all, as tho It was the gyss, And thus the king he salust, one this wiss: âShir king, one to yow am y sende Frome the worthiest that in world is kend, That leuyth now of his tyme and age, Of manhed, wisdome, &amp; of hie curag, Galiot, sone of the fare gyande; And thus, at short, he bidis yow your londe Ye yald hyme our, without Impedyment; Or of hyme holde, and if tribut and rent.

The knicht is gon, the king he gan Inquere At gawan, and at other knychtis sere, If that thei knew or euer hard recorde Of galiot, and wharof he wes lorde; And ther was non among his knychtis all Which ansuerd o word in to the hall. Than galygantynis of walys rase, That trauelit in diuerss londis has, In mony knychtly auentur haith ben; And to the king he saith, âsir, I haue sen Galiot, which is the farest knycht, And hiest be half a fut one hycht, That euer I saw, and ek his men accordith; Hyme lakid nocht that to a lord recordith. For visare of his ag is non than hee, And ful of larges and humylytee; An hart he haith of pasing hie curag, And is not xxiiij ?er of age, And of his tyme mekil haith conquerit; Ten kingis at his command ar sterit.

Not say I this, sir, in to ye entent That he, nor none wnder the firmament, Shal pouere haue ayane your maiestee; And, or thei shuld, this y sey for mee, Rather I shall knychtly in to feild Resaue my deith anarmyt wnder sheld.

His most huntyng was atte wyld bore; God wot a lustye cuntree was It thoore, In the ilk tyme! weil long this noble king In to this lond haith maid his siiornyng. Frome the lady was send o mesinger Of melyhalt, wich saith one this maner, As that the story shewith by recorde: âTo yow, sir king, as to hir soueran lorde, My lady hath me chargit for to say How that your lond stondith in affray; For galiot, sone of the fare gyande, Enterit Is by armys in your land, And so the lond and cuntre he anoyth, That quhar he goith planly he distroyth, And makith al obeisand to his honde, That nocht is left wnconquest in that lond, Excep two castellis longing to hir cwre, Wich to defend she may nocht long endure. Wharfor, sir, in wordis plan &amp; short, Ye mon dispone your folk for to support.â âWel,â quod the king, âone to thi lady say, The neid is myne, I fall It not delay; But what folk ar thei nemmyt for to bee, That in my lond is cumyne in sich degree?â âAn hundreth thousand boith vith sheld &amp; spere On hors ar armyt, al redy for the were.â âWel,â quod the king, âand but delay this nycht, Or than to morn as that the day is lycht, I shal remuf; ther shal no thing me mak Impedyment my Iorney for to tak.â Than seith his knychtis al with one assent, âShir, that is al contrare our entent; For to your folk this mater is wnwist, And ye ar here our few for to recist ?one power, and youre cuntre to defende; Tharfor abid, and for your folk ye send, That lyk a king and lyk a weriour Ye may susten in armys your honoure.â âNow,â quod the king, âno langer that I ?eme My crowne my septure, nor my dyademe, Frome that I here, ore frome I wnderstand, That ther by fors be entrit in my land Men of armys by strenth of vyolens, If that I mak abid or resydens In to o place langar than o nycht, For to defend my cuntre &amp; my rycht.â The king that day his mesage haith furth sent Throuch al his realme, and syne to rest is went. Up goith the morow, wp goith the brycht day, Wp goith the sone in to his fresh aray; Richt as he spred his bemys frome northest, The king wprass withouten more arest, And by his awn conseil and entent His Iornaye tuk at short awysment. And but dulay he goith frome place to place Whill that he cam nere whare the lady was, And in one plane, apone o reuer syde, He lichtit doune, and ther he can abide; And yit with hyme to batell fore to go Vij thousand fechteris war thei, &amp; no mo. This was the lady, of qwhome befor I tolde, That lancilot haith in to hir kepinge holde; But for to tell his pasing hewynesse, His peyne, his sorow, and his gret distresse Of presone and of loues gret suppris, It war to long to me for to dewys. When he remembrith one his hewy charge Of loue, wharof he can hyme not discharge, He wepith and he sorowith in his chere, And euery nyght semyth hyme o yere. Gret peite was the sorow that he maad, And to hyme self apone this wiss he saade: âQwhat haue y gilt, allace! or qwhat deseruit? That thus myne hart shal vondit ben &amp; carwit One by the suord of double peine and wo? My comfort and my plesans is ago, To me is nat that shuld me glaid reseruit. I curss the tyme of myne Natiuitee, Whar in the heuen It ordinyd was for me, In all my lyue neuer til haue eess; But for to be example of disess, And that apperith that euery vicht may see. Sen thelke tyme that I had sufficians Of age, and chargit thoghtis sufferans, Nor neuer I continewite haith o day With-out the payne of thoghtis hard assay; Thus goith my youth in tempest &amp; penans. And now my body is In presone broght; Bot of my wo, that in Regard is noght, The wich myne hart felith euer more. O deth, allace! whi hath yow me forbore That of remed haith the so long besoght!â Thus neueremore he sesith to compleine, This woful knyght that felith not bot peine, So prekith hyme the smert of loues sore, And euery day encressith more and more. And with this lady takine is also And kepit whar he may no whare go To haunt knychthed, the wich he most desirit; And, thus his hart with dowbil wo yfirite, We lat hyme duel here with the lady still, Whar he haith laisere for to compleine his fyll. And galiot in this meyne tyme he laie By strong myght o castell to assay, With many engyne and diuerss wais sere, For of fute folk he had a gret powere That bowis bur, and vther Instrumentis, And with them lede ther pal?onis &amp; ther tentis, With mony o strong chariot and cher With yrne qwhelis and barris long &amp; sqwar; Well stuffit with al maner apparell That longith to o sege or to batell; Whar with his ost was closit al about, That of no strenth nedith hyme to dout. And when he hard the cumyne of the king, And of his ost, and of his gaderyng, The wich he reput but of febil myght Ayanis hyme for to susten the ficht, His consell holl assemblit he, but were, Ten kingis with other lordis sere, And told them of the cuming of the king, And askit them there consell of that thing. Hyme thoght that it his worschip wold degrade, If he hyme self in propir persone raide Enarmyt ayane so few menye As It was told arthur fore to bee; And thane the kyng An hundereth knychtis cold, (And so he hot, for neuermore he wolde Ryd of his lond, but In his cumpany O hundyre knyghtis ful of chiuellry), He saith, âshir, ande I one hond tak, If It you pless, this Iorney shal I mak.â Quod galiot, âI grant It yow, but ye Shal first go ryd, yone knychtis ost &amp; see.â With-outen more he ridith our the plan, And saw the ost, and is returnyd aya?; And callit them mo than he hade sen, for why He dred the represe of his cumpany. And to his lord apone this wys saith hee, âShir, ten thousand y ges them for to bee.â And galiot haith chargit hyme to tak Als fell folk, and for the feld hyme mak. And so he doith and haith them wel Arayt. Apone the morne his banaris war displayt. Up goth the trumpetis with the clariouns, Ayaine the feld blawen furth ther sownis; Furth goth this king with al his ost anon. Be this the word wes to king arthur gone, That knew no thing, nor wist of ther entent, But sone his folk ar one to armys went; But arthur by Report hard saye How galiot non armys bur that day, Wharfor he thoght of armys nor of sheld None wald he tak, nor mak hyme for the feld. But gawane haith he clepit, was hyme by, In qwhome Rignith the flour of cheuelry, And told one what maner, and one what wyss He shuld his batelles ordand and dewys, Beseching hyme, wisly to for-see A?aine thei folk, wich was far mo than hee. He knew the charg, and passith one his way Furth to his horss, and makith no dulay; The clariounis blew, and furth goth al ono?, And our ye watter and the furd ar go?e. Within o playne vpone that other syd Ther gawan gon his batellis to dewide, As he wel couth, and set them in aray, Syne with o manly contynans can say, âYe falowis wich of the round table be? Through al this erth whois fam is hard &amp; sen, Remembrith now It stondith one the poynt, For why It lyith one your speris poynt, The well fare of the king and of our londe; And sen the sucour lyith in your honde, And hardement is thing shall most awaill Frome deth ther men of armys in bataill, Lat now your manhed and your hie curage The pryd of al thir multitude assuage.

Than haith sir gawan send, them to support, One othir batell with one knychtly sorte, And syne the thrid, and syne the ferde also; And syne hyme self one to the feld can go, When that he sauch thar latter batell steir, And the ten thousand cummyne al thei veir; Qwhar that of armes prewit he so well, His ennemys gane his mortall [strokis] fell. He goith ymong them in his hie curage, As he that had of knyghthed the wsage, And couth hyme weill conten in to on hour; A?aine his strok resistit non armour; And mony knycht, that worth ware and bolde, War thore with hyme of arthuris houshold, And knyghtly gan one to the feld them bere, And mekil wroght of armys In to were; Sir gawan than vpone such wyss hyme bure, This othere goith al to discumfitoure; Sewyne thousand fled, &amp; of the feld thei go, Whar of this king in to his hart was wo, For of hyme self he was of hie curage. To galiot than send he in mesag, That he shuld help his folk for to defende; And he to hyme hath xxx?? thousand sende; Whar of this king gladith in his hart, And thinkith to Reweng all the smart That he to for haith suffirit and the payne.

This vthere folk with straucht courss hath socht Out of aray atour the larg felld; Thar was the strokis festnit in the shelde, Thei war Resauit at the speris end; So arthuris folk can manfully defend; The formest can thar lyues end conclude, Whar sone assemblit al the multitude. Thar was defens, ther was gret assaill, Richt wonderfull and strong was y? bataill, Whar arthuris folk sustenit mekil payn, And knychtly them defendit haith a?aine. Bot endur thei mycht, apone no wyss, The multitude and ek the gret suppriss; But gawan, wich that setith al his payn Vpone knyghthed, defendid so a?aine, That only in the manhede of this knyght His folk reIosit them of his gret myght, And ek abasit hath his ennemys; For throw the feld he goith in such wyss, And in the press so manfully them seruith, His suerd atwo the helmys al to-kerwith, The hedis of he be the shouderis smat; The horss goith, of the maister desolat. But what awalith al his besynes, So strong and so insufferable vas the press?

Thar was the strenth, ther was the pasing myght Of gawan, wich that whill the dirk nyght Befor the luges faucht al hyme alo?, When that his falowis entrit ware ilko?. On arthuris half war mony tan and slan; And galotis folk Is hame returnyd a?aine, For it was lait; away the ostis ridith, And gawan ?it apone his horss abidith, With suerd in hond, when thei away var gon, And so for-wrocht hys lymmys ver ilkon, And wondit ek his body vp and doune, Vpone his horss Right thore he fel in swoune; And thei hyme tuk &amp; to his lugyne bare, Boith king and qwen of hyme vare in dispare, For thei supposit, throw marwellis that he vroght, He had hyme self to his confusioune broght.

This knycht, the wich that long haith ben in cag, He grew in to o fresch &amp; new curage, Seing the morow blythfull and amen, The med, the Reuer, and the vodis gren, The knychtis in armys them arayinge, The baneris ayaine the feld displayng. His ?outh in strenth and in prosperytee, And syne of lust the gret aduersytee, Thus in his thocht remembryng at the last, Efterward one syd he gan his Ey to cast, Whar our a bertes lying haith he sen Out to the feld luking was the qwen; Sudandly with that his gost astart Of loue anone haith caucht hyme by the hart; Than saith he, âHow long shall It be so, Loue, at yow shall wirk me al this wo?

Tharfor y red hir thonk at yow disserue, Or in hir presens lyk o knycht to sterf.â With that confusit with an hewy thocht, Wich ner his deith ful oft tyme haith hyme socht, Deuoydit was his spritis and his gost, He wist not of hyme self nor of his ost; Bot one his horss, als still as ony ston. When that the knychtis armyt war ilkon, To warnnyng them vp goith the bludy sown, And euery knyght vpone his horss is bown, Twenty thousand armyt men of were. The king that day he wold non armys bere; His batellis ware deuysit euerilkon, And them forbad out our the furdis to gon. Bot frome that thei ther ennemys haith sen, In to such wys thei couth them noght suste?; Bot ovr thei went vithouten more delay, And can them one that oyer sid assay.

The Red knycht with spuris smat the sted, The tother cam, that of hyme hath no drede; With ferss curag ben the knychtis met, The king his spere apone the knycht hath set, That al in peciss flaw in to the felde; His hawbrek helpit, suppos he had no scheld; And he the king in to the scheld haith ton, That horss and man boith to the erd ar gon.

[A]nd Arthuris folk, that lykith not to byde, In goith the spuris in the stedis syde; To-giddir thar assemblit al the ost, At whois meting many o knycht was lost. The batell was richt crewell to behold, Of knychtis wich that haith there lyvis ?olde. One to the hart the spere goith throw the scheld, The knychtis gaping lyith in the feld.

For qwhen that he beholdith to the qwen, Who had ben thore his manhed to haue sen, His doing in to armys and his myght, Shold say in world war not such o wight. His falouschip siche comfort of his dede Haith ton, that thei ther ennemys ne dreid; But can them self ay manfoly conten In to the stour, that hard was to susten; For galyot was O pasing multitude Of prewit men in armys that war gude, The wich can with o fresch curag assaill Ther ennemys that day In to batell; That ne ware not the vorschip &amp; manhede Of the red knycht, in perell and in dreid Arthuris folk had ben, vith-outen vere; Set thei var good, thei var of smal powere.

And for the tyme the trewis shal endure, Yhour cuntre and yhour lond he will assurre; And wit ?he ?hit his powar is nocht here. And als he bad ws say yhow by the yhere, The gud knycht wich that the Red armys bure And in the feild maid the discumfiture, The whilk the flour of knychthed may be cold, He thinkith hyme to haue of his houshold.â âWell,â quod the king, âI have hard quhat yhe say, Bot if god will, and ek if that I may, In to sich wyss I think for to withstond, Yhour lord shall have no powar of my londe.â Of this mesag the king Reiosing hass, And of the trewis wich that grantit was, Bot anoyt ?hit of the knycht was he, Wich thei awant to have in such dogre. Ther leif thei tuk; and when at thei war gon, This maister saith, âhow lykith god dispone! Now may yhow se &amp; suth is my recorde; For by hyme now is makith this accord; And by non vthir worldly providens, Sauf only grant of his bynewolans, To se if that the lykith to amend, And to prouid thi cuntre to defend. Wharfor yow shalt in to thi lond home fair, And gowerne the as that I shall declaire. First, thi god with humble hart yow serfe, And his comand at al thi mycht obserf; And syne, lat pass the ilk blessit wonde Of lowe with mercy Iustly throw thi londe; And y beseichâto quhome yow sal direke The rewle vpone, the wrangis to correkâ That yow be nocht in thi electioune blynde; For writin It Is and yow sal trew It fynde, That, be thei for to thonk or ellis blame, (And towart god thi part shal be the sa?;) Of Ignorans shalt yow nocht be excusit, Bot in ther werkis sorly be accusit, For thow schuld euer chess apone sich wyss The minsteris that rewll haith of Iustice:â First, that he be descret til wnderstond And lowe and ek the mater of the londe; And be of mycht and ek Autoritee, (For puple ay contempnith low degre,) And that of trouth he folow furth the way; That is als mych as he louyth trewth alway, And haitith al them the wich sal pas therfro. Syne, that he god dreid and lowe al-so. Of auerice be war with the desyre, And of hyme full of hastynes &amp; fyre; Be war thar for of malice and desire, And hyme also that lowith no medyre; For al thir abhominable was hold, When Iustice was in to the tymis olde. For qwho that is of an of thir by-know, The lest of them subuertith al the low, And makith It w[n]Iustly to procede; Eschew tharfor, for this sal be thi meid Apone the day when al thing goith aright, Whar none excuss hidyng schal ye lyght; Bot he the Iug, that no man may susspek, Euery thing ful Iustly sal correk. Be war thar with, as before have I told, And chess them wysly that thi low shal hold. And als I will that it well oft be sen, Richt to thi self how thei thi low conten; And how the Right, and how the dom is went, For to Inquer that yow be delygent. And punyss for, for o thing shal yow know, The most trespas is to subuert the low, So that yow be not in thar gilt accusit, And frome the froit of blissit folk refusit. And pas yow shalt to euery chef toune, Throw out the boundis of thi Regioune Whar yow sall be, that Iustice be Elyk With-out diuisione baith to pur &amp; ryk. And that thi puple have awdiens With thar complantis, and also thi presens; For qwho his eris frome the puple stekith, And not his hond in ther support furth rekith, His dom sall be ful grewous &amp; ful hard, When he sal cry and he sal nocht be hard. Wharfor thyne eris ifith to the pwre, Bot in redress of ned, &amp; not of inIure; Thus sall thei don of Ressone &amp; knawlag. But kingis when thei ben of tender ag, Y wil not say I trast thei ben excusit, Bot schortly thei sall be sar accusit, When so thei cum to yheris of Resone, If thei tak not full contrisioune, And pwnyss them that hath ther low mysgyit. That this is trouth it may not be denyit; For vther ways thei sal them not discharg, One estatis of ther realm, that shold With-in his ?outh se that his low be hold. And thus thow the, with mercy, kep alway. Of Iustice furth the ilk blessit way. And of thi wordis beis trew and stable, Spek not to mych, nore be not vareable. O kingis word shuld be o kingis bonde, And said It is, a kingis word shuld stond; O kingis word, among our faderis old, Al out more precious &amp; more sur was hold Than was the oth or seel of any wight; O king of trouth suld be the werray lyght, So treuth and Iustice to o king accordyth. And als, as thir clerkis old recordith, In tyme is larges and humilitee Right well according vnto hie dugre, And plessith boith to god and man al-so; Wharfor I wil, incontinent thow go, And of thi lond in euery part abide, Whar yow gar fet and clep one euery sid Out of thi cuntreis, and ek out of thi tovnis, Thi dukis, erlis, and thi gret baronis, Thi pur knychtis, and thi bachleris, And them resauf als hartly as afferis, And be them self yow welcum them ilkon: Syne, them to glaid and cheris, thee dispone With festing and with humyll contynans. Be not pensyve, nore proud in arrogans, Bot with them hold in gladnes cumpany; Not with the Rich nor myghty anerly, Bot with the pure worthi man also, With them thow sit, with them yow ryd and go. I say not to be our fameliar, For, as the most philosephur can duclar, To mych to oyss familiaritee Contempnyng bryngith one to hie dugre: Bot cherice them with wordis fair depaynt, So with thi pupelle sal yow the aquaynt. Than of ilk cuntre wysly yow enquere An agit knycht to be thi consulere, That haith ben hold in armys Richt famus, Wyss and discret, &amp; no thing Inwyus; For ther is non that knowith so wel, I-wyss, O worthy man as he that worthi Is. When well long haith yow swiornyt in a place, And well acqueynt the vith thi puple has, Than shalt thow ordand &amp; prowid the Of horss and ek of armour gret plente, Of gold, and siluer, tressore, and cleithing, And euery Riches that longith to o king; And when the lykith for to tak thi leif, By largess thus yow thi reward geif, First to the pure worthy honorable, That is til armys and til manhed able; (Set he be pur, ?hit worschip in hyme bidith); If hyme the horss one wich thi selwyne Ridith, And bid hyme that he Rid hyme for yhour sak; Syne til hyme gold and siluer yow betak; The horss to hyme for worschip and prowes, The tresor for his fredome and larges. If most of Riches, and of Cherising Eftir this gud knycht berith vitnesing. Syne to thi tennandis &amp; to thi wawasouris If essy haknays, palfrais, and cursouris And robis sich as plesand ben and fair; Syne to thi lordis wich at mychty aire, As dukis, erlis, princis, and ek kingis, Yow if them strang, yow if them vncouth thingis, As diuerss iowellis, and ek preciouss stonis, Or halkis hundis, ordinit for the nonis, Or wantone horss that can nocht stand in st?ble; Thar giftis mot be fair and delitable. Thus, first vn to the vorthi pur yow if Giftis, that may ther pouerte Releif; And to the rich iftis of plesans, That thei be fair, set nocht of gret substans; For riches askith no thing bot delyt, And powert haith ay ane appetyt For to support ther ned and Indigens: Thus shall yow if and makith thi dispens. And ek the quen, my lady, shalt also To madenis and to ladeis, quhar ?he go, If, and cheriss one the samyne wyss; For in to largess al thi welfar lyis. And if thy giftis with sich continans That thei be sen ay gifyne vith plesans; The wyss man sais, and suth it is approuit. Thar is no thonk, thar is no ift alowit, Bot It be ifyne In to sich manere, That is to say, als glaid in to his chere, As he the wich the ift of hyme Resauith; And do he not, the gifar is dissauith; For who that iffis, as he not if wald, Mor profit war his ift for to with-hald; His thonk he tynith, and his ift also. Bot that thow ifith, if with boith two, That is to say, vith hart and hand atonis; And so the wysman ay ye ift disponis. Beith larg and iffis frely of thi thing; For largess is the tresour of o king, And not this other Iowellis nor this gold That is in to thi tresory with-holde. Who gladly iffith, be vertew of larges His tresory encresis of Richesss, And sal a?a?e the mor al out resawe. For he to quhome he ?ewith sall hawe, First his body, syne his hart with two, His gudis al for to dispone also In his seruice; and mor atour he shall Have O thing, and that is best of all, That is to say, the worschip and the loss That vpone larges in this world furth goss. And yow shal knaw the lawbour &amp; the press In to this erth about the gret Richess. Is ony, bot apone the causs we see Of met, of cloth, &amp; of prosperitee? All the remanant stant apone the name Of purches, furth apone this worldis fame. And well yow wot, in thyne allegians Ful many Is, the wich haith sufficians Of euery thing that longith to ther ned; What haith yow more, qwich them al to lede, For al thi Realmys and thi gret Riches, If that yow lak of worschip the encress? Well less, al out; for efter thar estate Thei have vorschip, and kepith It al gat; And yow degradith al thyne hie dugree, That so schuld shyne In to nobelitee, Throuch wys and throw the wrechitness of hart. And knowis yow not what sall be thi part, Out of this world when yow sal pass the courss? Fair well, I-wyss! yow neuer shall Recourss Whar no prince more shall the subiet have, But be als dep in to the erd y-grave, Sauf vertew only and worschip wich abidith With them; the world apone the laif dewidith; And if he, wich shal eftir the succed, By larges spend, of quhich that yhow had dreid, He of the world comendit is and prisit, And yow stant furth of euery thing dispisit; The puple saith and demyth thus of thee, âNow is he gone, a werray vrech was hee, And he the wich that is our king and lord Boith wertew haith &amp; larges in accorde; Welcum be he!â and so the puple soundith. Thus through thi viss his wertew mor aboundith, And his vertew the more thi wice furth schawith. Wharfor ?he, wich that princes ben y-knawith, Lat not yhour vrechit hart so yhow dant, That he that cummyth next yhow may awant To be mor larg, nore more to be commendit; Best kepit Is the Riches well dispendit. O ?he, the wich that kingis ben, fore sham Remembrith yhow, this world hath bot o naa? Of good or ewill, efter ?he ar gone! And wysly tharfor chessith yhow the to? Wich most accordith to nobilitee, And knytith larges to yhour hie degre. For qwhar that fredome In O prince Ringnis, It bryngith In the victory of kingis, And makith realmys and puple boith to dout, And subectis of the cuntre al about. And qwho that thinkith ben o conquerour, Suppos his largess sumquhat pas mysour, Ne rak he nat, bot frely iffith ay; And as he wynyth, beis var al-way To mych nor ?hit to gredy that he hold, Wich sal the hartis of the puple colde. And low and radour cummyth boith two Of larges; Reid and ?he sal fynd It so. Alexander, this lord the warld that wan, First with the suerd of larges he began, And as he wynith ifith largely, He rakith No thing bot of cheuelry; Wharfor of hyme so passith the Renown, That many o cetee, and many o strang tow?, Of his worschip that herith the Recorde, Dissirith so to haveing sich o lorde, And offerith them with-outen strok of spere, Suppos that thei war manly men of were, But only for his gentilless that thei Have hard; and so he louit was al-way For his larges, humilitee, and manhed, With his awn folk, that neuermore, we Reid, For al his weris nor his gret trawell, In al his tym that thei hyme onys faill; Bot in his worschip al thar besynes Thei set, and lewith in to no distres; Whar-throw the suerd of victory he berith. And many prince full oft the palm werith, As has ben hard, by largess, of before, In conqueringe of Rignis &amp; of glore. And wrechitnes Richt so, in the contrar, Haith Realmys maid ful desolat &amp; barre, And kingis broght doun from ful hie estat; And who that Red ther old bukis, wat The vicis lef, the wertew have in mynde, And takith larges In his awn kynd, A-myd standing of the vicis two, Prodegalitee and awerice also; Wharfor her of It nedith not to more, So mych ther of haith clerkis vrit to fore. Bot who the wertw of larges &amp; the law Sal chess, mot ned considir well &amp; knaw In to hyme self, and thir thre wnderstande, The substans first, the powar of his land, Whome to he iffith, and the causs wharfore, The nedful tyme awatith euermore. Kepith thir thre; for qwho that sal exced His rent, he fallith sodandly in nede. And so the king, that on to myster drowis, His subiettis and his puple he our-thrawis, And them dispol?eith boith of lond and Rent; So is the king, so is the puple schent. For quhi the woice It scrikth vp ful ewyne With-out abaid, and passith to the hewyne, Whar god hyme self resauith ther the crye Of the oppresioune and the teranny, And vith the suerd of wengans doun ysmytith, The wich that caruith al to sor, and bitith, And hyme distroyth, as has ben hard or this Of euery king that wirkith sich o mys. For ther is few eschapith them, It sall Boith vpone hyme &amp; his successione fall; For he forsuth haith ifyne hyme the wond To Iustefy and Reull in pece his lond, The puple all submytit to his cure; And he a?an one to no creatur Save only shall vn to his gode obey. And if he passith so far out of the wey, Them to oppress, that he shuld reul &amp; gid, Ther heritag, there gwdis to dewide, Ye, wnder whome that he most nedis stond, At correccioune sal strek his mychty hond, Not euery day, bot shal at onys fall On hyme, mayhap, and his succescione all. In this, allace! the blyndis of the kingis, And Is the fall of princis and of Rygnis. The most wertew, the gret Intellegens, The blessit tokyne of wysdom and prudens Isss, in o king, for to restren his honde Frome his pupleis Riches &amp; ther lond. Mot euery king have this wice in mynd In tyme, and not when that he ned fynde! And in thi larges beith war, I pray, Of nedful tyme, for than is best alway. Awyss the ek quhome to that thow salt if, Of there fam, and ek how that thei leif; And of the wertws and wicious folk also, I the beseich dewidith well thir two, So that thei stond nocht in o degree; Discreccioune sall mak the diuersitee, Wich clepith the moder of al vertewis. And beith war, I the beseich of this, That is to say of flatry, wich that longith To court, and al the kingis larges fongith. The vertuouss man no thing thar-of resauith, The flattereris now so the king dissauith And blyndith them that wot no thing, I-wyss, When thei do well, or quhen thei do o myss; And latith kingis oft til wnderstonde Thar vicis, and ek ye faltis of ther lond. In to the realme about o king Is holde O flatterere were than is the stormys cold, Or pestelens, and mor the realme anoyith, For he the law and puple boith distroyith. And in to principall ben ther three thingis, That caussith flattereris stonding with the kingis; And on, It is the blyndit Ignorans Of kingis, wich that hath no gouernans To wnderstond who doith sich o myss; But who that farest schewith hym, I-wyss, Most suffisith and best to his plesans. Wo to the realme that havith sich o chans! And secundly, quhar that o king Is Weciuss hyme self, he cherissith, ywys, Al them the wich that one to vicis soundith, Whar throw that vicis and flattery ek aboundith. The thrid, is the ilk schrewit harrmful wice, Wich makith o king within hyme self so nyce, That al thar flattry and ther gilt he knowith In to his wit, and ?hit he hyme with-drowith Them to repref, and of ther vicis he wot; And this It is wich that dissemblyng hot, That in no way accordith for o king. Is he not set abuf apone his Ringne, As souerane his puple for to lede? Whi schuld he spare, or quhom of schuld he dred To say the treuth, as he of Right is hold? And if so ware that al the kingis wold, When that his legis comytit ony wyce, As beith not to schamful, nore to nyce, That thei presume that he is negligent, But als far as he thinkith that thei mysswent, But dissemblyng reprewith as afferis, And pwnice them quhar pwnysing Requeris, Sauf only mercy in the tyme of ned. And so o king he schuld his puple led, That no trespass, that cummyth in his way, Shuld pass his hond wne-pwnist away; Nore no good deid in to the samyn degree, Nore no wertew, suld wn-Reuardid bee. Than flattry shuld, that now is he, be low, And wice from the kingis court with-drow; His minsteris that shuld the Iustice reull, Shuld kep well furth of quiet &amp; reull, That now, god wat, as It conserwit Is, The stere is lost, and al is gon amys; And vertew shuld hame to the court hyme dress, That exillith goith in to the wildernes. Thus if o king stud lyk his awn degree, Wertwis and wyss than shuld his puple bee, Only set by vertew hyme to pless, And sore adred his wisdom to displess. And if that he towart the vicis draw, His folk sall go on to that ilk law; What shal hyme pless that wil nocht ellis fynd, Bot ther apon setith al ther mynde. Thus only in the wertew of o king The reull stant of his puple &amp; his ringne, If he be wyss and, but dissemblyng, schewis, As I have said, the vicis one to schrewis. And so thus, sir, It stant apone thi will For to amend thi puple, or to spill; Or have thi court of vertewis folk, or fullis; Sen yow art holl maister of the scoullis Teichith them, and thei sal gladly leir, That is to say, that thei may no thing heir Sauf only wertew towart thyn estat; And cheriss them that wertews ben algait. And thinkith what that wertew is to thee; It plessith god, vphaldith thi degree.â âMaister,â quod he, âme think rycht profitable Yowr conseell Is, and wonder honorable For me, and good; rycht well I have consauit, And in myne hartis Inwartness resauit. I shal fulfill and do yowr ordynans Als far of wit as I have suffisans; Bot y beseich yow, in til hartly wyss, That of my drem ?he so to me dewyss, The wich so long haith occupeid my mynd, How that I shal no maner sucour fynd Bot only throw the wattir lyon, &amp; syne The leich that is withouten medysyne, And of the consell of the flour; wich ayre Wonderis lyk that no man can duclar.â âNow, sir,â quod he, âand I of them al thre, What thei betakyne shal I schaw to the, Such as the clerkis at them specefiit; Thei vsit no thing what thei signefiit. The wattir lyone Is the god werray, God to the lyone is lyknyt many way; But thei have hyme In to the wattir se?, Confusit were ther wittis al, y we?; The wattir was ther awn fragelitee, And thar trespas, and thar Inequitee In to this world, the wich thei stond yclosit; That was the wattir wich thei have supposit, That haith there knowlag maad so Inperfyt; Thar syne &amp; ek ther worldis gret delyt, As clowdy wattir, was euermore betwe?, That thei the lyone perfitly hath nocht se?; Bot as the wattir, wich was yer awn synne, That euermor thei stond confusit In. If thei haith stond in to religio? clen, Thei had the lyone Not in watter sen, Bot clerly vp in to the hewyne abuf, Eternaly whar he shal not remufe. And euermore in vatter of syne vas hee, For quhi It is Imposseble for to bee; And thus the world, wich that thei ar In, Yclosit Is in dyrknes of ther syne; And ek the thikness of the air betwen The lyone mad in vattir to be sen. For It was nocht bot strenth of ther clergy Wich thei have here, and It is bot erthly, That makith them there resouns dewyss, And se the lyone thus in erthly wyss. This is the lyone, god, and goddis sone, Ihesu crist, wich ay in hewyne sal wonne. For as the lyone of euery best is king, So is he lord and maister of al thing, That of the blessit vyrgyne vas ybore. Ful many a natur the lyone haith, quhar fore That he to god resemblyt is, bot I Lyk not mo at this tyme specify. This is the lyone, thar of have yow no dred, That shal the help and comfort In thi ned. The sentens here now woll I the defyne Of hyme, the lech withouten medysyne, Wich is the god that euery thing hath vroght. For yow may know that vther Is It noght, As surgynis and fesicianis, wich that delith With mortell thingis, and mortell thingis helyth, And al thar art is in to medysyne, As it is ordanit be the mycht dewyne, As plasteris, drinkis, and anouyntmentis seir, And of the qualyte watyng of the yher; And of the planetis disposicioune, And of the naturis of compleccyoune, And in the diuerss changing of hwmowris. Thus wnder reull lyith al there cwris; And yhit thei far as blynd man In the way Oft, quhen that deith thar craft lift to assay. Bot god, the wich that is the soueran lech, Nedith no maner medysyne to sech; For ther is no Infyrmyte, nore wound, Bot as hyme lykith al is holl and sound. So can he heill Infyrmytee of thoght, Wich that one erdly medesyne can noght; And als the saul that to confusioune goith, And haith with hyme and vther parteis boith, His dedly wound god helyth frome the ground; On to his cure no medysyne is found. This Is his mycht that neuer more shall fyne, This is the leich withouten medysyne; And If that yhow at confessioune hath ben, And makith the of al thi synnis clen, Yow art than holl, and this ilk samyn is he Schall be thi leich In al necessitee. Now of the flour y woll to the discer?: This is the flour that haith the froyt eter?, This is the flour, this sadith for no schour, This is the flour of euery flouris floure; This is the flour, of quhom the froyt vas bor?, This ws redemyt efter that we war lor?; This Is the flour that euer spryngith new, This is the flour that changith neuer hew; This is the vyrgyne, this is the blessit flour That Ihesu bur that is our salweour, This flour wnwemmyt of hir wirginitee; This is the flour of our felicitee, This is the flour to quhom ve shuld exort, This is the flour not sessith to support In prayere, consell, and in byssynes, Vs catifis ay In to our wrechitnes On to hir sone, the quich hir consell herith; This is the flour that al our gladness sterith, Throuch whois prayer mony one is sawit, That to the deth eternaly war resawit, Ne war hir hartly suplicatioune. This is the flour of our saluatioune, Next hir sone, the froyt of euery flour; This is the sam that shal be thi succour, If that the lykith hartly Reuerans And seruice ?eld one to hir excellens, Syne worschip hir with al thi byssyness; Sche sal thi harm, sche sall thi ned redress Sche sall sice consell if one to the two, The lyone and the souerane lech also, Yow sall not Ned yi dre? for to dispar, Nor ?hit no thing that is in thi contrare. Nowââquod the maisterââyow may well wnderstand Tueching thi drem as I have born on hande; And planly haith the mater al declarith, That yhow may know of wich yow was disparith. The lech, the lyone, and the flour also, Yow worschip them, yow serve them euermo; And ples the world as I have said before; In gouernans thus stondith al thi glore. Do as yow list, for al is in thi honde, To tyne thi self, thi honore, and thi londe, Or lyk o prince, o conquerour, or king, In honore and in worschip for to Ringe.â âNow,â quod the king, âI fell that the support Of yhour consell haith don me sich comfort, Of euery raddour my hart is In to ess, To ?hour command, god will, y sal obess. Bot o thing is yneuch wn to me, How galiot makith his awant that he Shall have the knycht, that only by his honde And manhed, was defendour of my londe; If that shall fall y pray yhow tellith me, And quhat he hecht, and of quhat lond is hee?â âWhat that he hecht yow shall no foryer know, His dedis sall her efterwart hyme schaw; Bot contrar the he shall be found no way. No more thar of as now y will the say.â With that the king haith at his maistir tone His leve, one to his cuntre for to go?e; And al the ost makith none abyde, To passing home anone thei can prowid; And to sir gawane thei haith o lytter maad, Ful sore ywound, and hyme on with them haade. [T]he king, as that the story can declar, Passith to o Cete that was Right fair, And clepit cardole, In to walis, was, For that tyme than It was the nerest place, And thar he soiornyt xxiiij?? days In ryall festing, as the auttore says. So discretly his puple he haith cherit, That he thar hartis holy haith conquerit. And sir gawan helyt holl and sound Be xv dais he was of euery wounde; Right blyth therof in to the court war thei. And so befell, the xxiiij day, The king to fall in to o hewynes, Right ate his table siting at the mess; And sir gawan cummyth hyme before, And said hyme, âsir, yhour thoght is al to fore, Considering the diuerss knychtis sere Ar of wncouth and strang landis here.â The king ansuert, as in to matelent, âSir, of my thocht, or ?hit of myne entent, Yhe have the wrang me to repref, for quhy Thar lewith none that shuld me blam, for I Was thinkand one the worthiest that lewyt, That al the worschip In to armys prewyt; And how the thonk of my defens he had, And of the wow that galiot haith mad. But I have sen, when that of my houshold Thar was, and of my falowschip, that wold, If that thei wist, quhat thing shuld me pless, Thei wald nocht leif for trawell nor for ess. And sum tyme It preswmyt was &amp; said, That in my houshold of al this world I had The flour of knychted and of chevalry; Bot now thar of y se the contrarye, Sen that the flour of knychthed is away.â âSchir,â quod he, âof Resone suth yhe say; And if god will, In al this warld so Round He sal be soght, if that he may be found.â Than gawan goith with o knychtly chere, At the hal dure he saith In this maner: âIn this pasag who lykith for to wend?

EXPLICIT sECUNDA PARS, INCIPIT TERTIA PARS. The long dirk pasag of the vinter, &amp; the lycht Of phebus comprochit with his mycht; The which, ascending In his altitud, Awodith satur? with his stormys Rude; The soft dew one fra the hewyne doune valis Apone the erth, one hillis and on valis, And throw the sobir &amp; the mwst hwmouris Vp nurisit ar the erbis, and in the flouris Natur the erth of many diuerss hew Ourfret, and cled with the tendir new. The birdis may them hiding in the grawis Wel frome the halk, that oft ther lyf berevis; And scilla hie ascending in the ayre, That euery vight may heryng hir declar Of the sessone and passing lustynes. This was the tyme that phebus gan hym dress In to the rame, and haith his courss bygown, Or that the trewis and the ?her vas Rown, Which was yset of galiot and the king Of thar assemble, and of thar meting. Arthur haith a xv dais before Assemblit al his barnag and more That weryng wnder his subieccioune, Or louith hyme, or longith to his crown; And haith his Iornay tone, withouten let, On to the place the wich that was yset, Whar he hath found befor hyme mony o knycht That cummyng war with al thar holl mycht, Al enarmyt both with spere &amp; scheld, And ful of lugis plantith haith the feld, Hyme In the wer for to support and serf At al ther mycht, his thonk for to disserf, And gawan, which was in the seking ?hit Of the gud knycht, of hyme haith got no wit, Remembrith hyme apone the kingis day, And to his falowis one this wys can say: âTo ?how is knowin the mater, in what wyss How that the king hath with his ennemys A certan day, that now comprochit nere, And one to ws war hewynes to here That he var in to perell or in to dreid, And we away, and he of ws haith neid; For we but hyme no thing may eschef, And he but ws in honore well may lef; For, be he lost, we may no thing withstond, Our self, our honore we tyne, &amp; ek our lond. Tharfor, I red we pas on to the king, Suppos our oth It hurt in to sum thing, And in the feld with hyme for til endur, Of lyf or deth and tak our aduentur.â Thar to thei ar consentit euerilkon, And but dulay the have thar Iorney to?e. When that the king them saw, in his entent Was of thar com Right wonder well content; For he preswmyt no thing that thei wold Have cummyne, but one furth to yer seking hold. And thus the king his ost assemblit has A?ane the tyme, a?aine the day that vas Y-statut and ordanit for to bee, And euery thing hath set in the dogre. [A]nd galiot, that haith no thing for?het The termys quhich that he befor had set, Assemblit has, apone his best maner, His folk, and al his other thingis sere, That to o weryour longith to prouid, And is y-come apone the tothir syde. Whar he befor was one, than vas he two, And al his vthir artil?ery also He dowblith hath, that merwell was to se?; And by the rewere lychtit one the gre?, And stronghar thane ony wallit toune His ost y-bout yclosit in Randoune. Thus war thei cummyne apone ather syd Be-for the tyme, them self for to prowid. Or that the trewis was complet &amp; rwn, Men mycht have sen one euery sid begwn Many a fair and knychtly Iuperty Of lusty men, and of ?ong chevalry, Disyrus In to armys for to pruf; Sum for wynyng, sum causith vas for luf; Sum In to worschip to be exaltate, Sum causit was of wordis he &amp; hate, That lykit not ydill for to ben; A hundereth pair at onis one the gren. Thir lusty folk thus can thar tyme dispend, Whill that the trewis goith to the ende. The trewis past, the day is cummyne ono?e, One euery syd the can them to dispone; And thai that war most sacret &amp; most dere To galiot, at hyme the can enquere, âWho sal assemble one yhour syd to-mor?e? To-nycht the trewis to the end is worne.â He ansuerit, âAs yhit one to this were I ame awysit I wil none armys bere, Bot If It stond of more Necessitee; Nor to the feld will pas, bot for to see Yhone knycht, the which that berith sich o fame.â Than clepit he the conquest king be name, And hyme commandit xxx thousand tak A?aine the morne, and for the feld hyme mak. And gawane haith, apone the toyer syde, Consulit his Eme he schuld for them prowid, And that he schuld none armys to hyme tak Whill galiot will for the feld hyme mak. âI grant,â quod [he], âwharfor ?he mone dispone Yhow to the feld with al my folk to-morne, And thinkith in yhour manhed and curage For to recist ?hone folkis gret owtrag.â [T]he nycht is gone, vp goith the morow gray, The brycht sone so clerith al the day: The knychtis gone to armys than, in hast; One goith the scheildis, and the helmys last; Arthuris ost out our the furrde thai ryd. And thai agane, apone the toyer syd, Assemblit ar apone o lusty greyne, In to o waill, whar sone thar mycht be seyne Of knychtis to-geddir many o pair In to the feld assemblyng her &amp; thair, And stedis which that haith thar master lorne; The knychtis war done to the erth doune borne. Sir esquyris, which was o manly knycht In to hyme self, and hardy vas &amp; wycht; And in till armys gretly for to pryss, ?hit he was pure, he prewit wel oft syss; And that tyme was he of the cumpanee Of galiot, bot efterwart was hee With arthur; and that day In to the feild He come, al armyt boith with spere and scheld, With ferss desir, as he that had na dout, And is assemblit ewyne apone a rowt; His spere is gone, the knycht goith to the erd, And out onon he pullith haith o swerd; That day In armys prewit he rycht well, His strenth, his manhed arthuris folk thai fell. Than galys gwynans, with o manly hart, Which broyer was of ywane the bastart, He cummyne Is onone one to the stour For conquering In armys of honour, And cownterit with esquyris hath so, Than horss and man, al four, to erth thai go; And still o quhill lying at the ground. With that o part of arthuris folk thei found Till gwyans, and haith hyme sone reskewit.

Than ywane the anterus, aggrewit, With kynnismen one to the melle socht. The hardy knychtis, that one thar worschip thocht, Cownterit them In myddis of the scheld, Whar many o knycht was born doun in the feld; Bot thei wich ware on galiotis part, So wndertakand nor of so hardy hart Ne ware thei not as was in ye contrare. Sir galys gwyans was resqwyt thare With his falowis, and esqwyris don bore. Thar al the batellis cam, withouten more, On ather part, and is assemblit so Whar fyfty thousand war thei, &amp; no mo. In o plane besyd the gret Riwere Xxx thousand one galiotis half thei vare; Of arthuris x thousand and no mo Thei ware, and ?hit thai contenit them so, And in the feld so manly haith bor?, That of thar fois haith the feld forswor?. The conquest king, wich the perell knowith, Ful manly one to the feld he drowith; The lord sir gawan, couerit with his scheld, He ruschit in myddis of the feld, And haith them so in to his com assayt, That of his manhed ware thei al affrait; No langer mycht thei contrar hyme endur, Bot fled, and goith one to discumfiture. And galiot, wich haith the discumfit sen, Fulfillit ful of anger and of ten, Incontinent he send o new poware, Whar-with the feldis al our couerit ware Of armyt stedis both in plait and maill, With knychtis wich war reddy to assaill. Sir gawan, seing al the gret suppris Of fois cummyng In to sich o wys, Togiddir al his cumpany he drew, And confortable wordis to them schew; So at the cummyng of thar ennemys Thei them resauf, in so manly wyss, That many one felith deithis wound, And wnder horss lyith sobing one the ground. This vther cummyth in to gret desir, Fulfillit ful of matelent and Ire, So freschly, with so gret o confluens, Thar strong assay hath don sich vyolens, And at thar come arthuris folk so led, That thai war ay abaysit and adred.

Long mycht thei nocht endur in such dugree, The press it wos so creuell &amp; so strong, In gret anoy and haith continewit longe, That, magre them, thei nedis most abak The way one to thar lugis for to tak. Sir gawan thar sufferith gret myschef, And wonderis in his knychthed can he pref; His falouschip haith merwell that hym saw, So haith his fois that of his suerd stud aw. King arthur, that al this whill beheld The danger and the perell of the feld, Sir ywan with o falowschip he sende, Them In that ned to help &amp; to defend, Qwich fond them In to danger and in were, And enterit nere In to thar tentis were. Sir gawan fechtand was one fut At erde, And no defend, but only in his swerde, A?anis them both with spere and scheld. Of galowa the knycht goith to the erde. Thar was the batell furyous and woid Of armyt knychtis; to the grownde thai ?hud. Sir ywane, that was a noble knyght, He schew his strenth, he schew thar his gret mycht, In al his tyme that neuer of before Off armys, nore of knychthed, did he more: Sir gawan thar reskewit he of fors, Magre his fois, and haith hyme set one horss That frome the first conquest king he wa?; Bot sir gawan so ewill was wondit than, And in the feld supprisit was so sore, That he the werss thar of was euermore. Thar schew the lord sir ywan his curage, His manhed, &amp; his noble wassolage; And gawan, in his doing, wald nocht irk; So al the day enduring, to the dyrk Sal them, magre of thar desyre, constren On ayar half fore [to] depart in twen. And when that gawan of his horss vas to?, The blud out of his noiss &amp; mouth is go?, And largly so passith euery wounde, In swonyng thore he fell one to the ground: Than of the puple petee was to here The lemytable clamour, and the chere; And of the king the sorow and the care, That of his necis lyf was in disspare. âFar well,â he sais, âmy gladnes, &amp; my delyt, Apone knychthed far well myne appetit, Fare well of manhed al the gret curage, Yow flour of armys and of vassolage, Gif yow be lost!ââthus til his tent hyme brocht With wofull hart, and al the surry?enis socht, Wich for to cum was reddy at his neid; Thai fond the lord was of his lyf in dreid, For wondit was he, and ek wondit so, And in his syd ware brokyne Ribys two.

Alone rycht thar he howit, and abaade, Behalding to the bertes, whar the qwe? Befor at the assemble he had se?. Rycht so the sone schewith furth his lycht, And to his armour went is euery wycht; One athir half the Iusting is bygon, And many o fair and knych[t]ly courss is rown. The blak knycht ?hit howyns on his sted, Of al thar doing takith he no hed, Bot ay, apone the besynes of thocht, In beholding his ey departit nocht. To quhom the lady of melyhalt beheld, And knew hyme by his armour &amp; his scheld, Qwhat that he was; and thus sche said one hycht: âWho is he ?one? who may he be, ?hone knycht, So still that hovith and sterith not his Ren, And seith the knychtis rynyng one the gre??â Than al beholdith, and in princypale Sir gawan beholdith most of all; Of melyha[l]t the lady to hyme maid Incontinent, his couche and gart be had Be-fore o wyndew thore as he mycht se The knycht, the ost, and al the assemble. He lukith furth, and sone the knycht hath sen, And, but delay, he saith one to the qwen, âMadem, if ?he remembir, so it was The red knycht in to the samyne place That wencust al the first assemble; Whar that ?one knycht howis, howit hee.â â?ha,â quod the qwen, ârycht well remembir I; Qwhat is the causs at ?he inquere, &amp; quhy?â âMadem, of this larg warld is he The knycht the wich I most desir to see, His strenth, his manhed, his curag, and his mycht, Or do in armys, that longith to o knycht.â [B]y thus, arthur, with consell well awysit, Haith ordanit his batellis, and devysit: The first of them led ydrus king, &amp; he O worthy man vas nemmyt for to bee. The secund led harwy the Reweyll, That in this world was knycht that had most feill For to prowid that longith to the were, One agit knycht, and well couth armys bere. [T]he thrid feld deliuerit in the hond Of angus, king of ylys of scotlande, Wich cusing was one to king arthur nere, One hardy knycht he was, withouten were. The ferd batell led ywons the king, O manly knycht he was In to al thing. And thus dewysit ware his batellis sere, In euery feld xv thousand were. [T]he fift batell the lord sir ywan lede Whois manhed was in euery cuntre dred, Sone he was one to wryne the kyng, Forwart, stout, hardy, wyss, and ?hing; Xx thousand in his ost thai past, Wich ordanit was for to assemble last. [A]nd galiot, apone the tothir syde, Rycht wysly gan his batellis to dewid. The first of them led malenginys the king, None hardyar In to this erth lewyng; He neuer more out of his cuntre Raid, Nor he with hyme one hundereth knychtis hade. [T]he secund the first conquest king led, That for no perell of armys vas adred. The thrid, o king clepit walydeyne, He led, and was o manly knycht, but weyne. [T]he ferd, king clamedeus has, Wich that lord of far ylys was. The fift batell, whar xl thousand were, King brandymagus had to led and stere, O manly knycht, and prewit well oft syss, And in his consell wonder scharp &amp; wyss. Galiot non armys bur that day, Nor as o knycht he wald hyme-self aray, But as o seruand in o habariowne, O prekyne hat, and ek o gret trownsciow? In til his hond, and one o cursour set, The best that was in ony lond to get. Endlong the rewar men mycht behold &amp; see, Of knychtis weryne mony one assemble; And the blak knycht still he couth abyde, Without remowyng, one the Riwer syde, Bot to the bartes to behold and see Thar as his hart desyrit most to bee: And quhen the lady of melyhalt haith se? The knycht so stond, sche said one to the qwe?, âMadem, It is my consell at ?he send One to ?one knycht, ?our self for to commend, Beseiching hyme that he wald wndertak This day to do of armys, for ?our sak.â The quen ansuerit as that hir lykit nocht, For othir thing was more In to hir thocht, âFor well ?he se the perell how disiont, The adwentur now stondith one the point, Boith of my lord his honore, and his lond, And of his men, in danger how thai stond; Bot ?he, and ek thir vthere ladice may, If that yhow lykith, to the knycht gar say The mesag; is none that wil yhow let, For I tharof sal nocht me entermet.â On to the quen scho saith, âher I, If so it pless thir vthir ladice by, Am for to send one to the knycht content;â And al the ladice can thar to assent, Beseching hir the mesag to dewyss, As sche that was most prudent &amp; most wyss. Sche grantit, and o made? haith thei tone, Discret, apone this mesag for till gone; And sir gawan a sqwyar bad also, With two speris one to the knycht to go. The lady than, withouten more dulay, Haith chargit hir apone this wyss to say: âSchaw to the knycht, the ladice euer-ilkone Ben In the court, excep the quen allon, Til hyme them haith recommandit oft syss, Beseching hyme of knychthed and gentriss, (Or if It hapyne euermore that he shall Cum, quhar thai may, owther an or all, In ony thing awail hyme or support, Or do hyme ony plesans or comfort,) He wold wichsaif for loue of them this day In armys sum manhed to assay; And say, sir gawan, hyme the speris sent; Now go, this is the fek of our entent.â The damysell sche hath hir palfray tone, The sqwyar with the speris with hir go?; The nerest way thai pass one to ye knycht, Whar sche repete hir mesag haith ful rycht: And quhen he hard, and planly wnderstude, How that the quen not in the mesag ?ude, He spak no word, bot he was not content; Bot of sir gawan, glaid in his entent, He askit quhar he was, and of his fair. And thai to hyme the maner can duclair; Than the sqwyar he prayth that he wold Pass to the feld, the speris for to hold. He saw the knychtis semblyng her and thare, The stedis Rynyng with the sadillis bare; His spuris goith in to the stedis syde, That was ful swyft, and lykit not to byd; And he that was hardy, ferss, and stout, Furth by o syd assemblyng on a rout Whar that one hundereth knychtis was, &amp; mo; And with the first has Recounterit so, That frome the deth not helpith hym his scheld, Boith horss and man is lying in the feld; The spere is gone, and al in pecis brak, And he the trunscyoune in his hand hath tak That two or thre he haith the sadillis reft, Whill in his hond schortly no thing is left. Syne, to the squyar, of the feld is go?, Fro hyme o spere In to his hond haith ton, And to the feld returnyt he a?ayne: The first he met, he goith one the plan, And ek the next, and syne the thrid also; Nor in his hond, nore in his strak was ho.

His speris gone, out of the feld he socht, And passit is one to the Rewere syde, Rycht thore as he was wont for to abyde; And so beholdyne In the samyne pla?, As to the feld hyme lykit nocht a?a?. Sir gawan saw, and saith on to the quen, âMadem, yhone knycht disponit [not], I wey?, To help ws more, fore he so is awysit; As I presume, he thinkith hyme dispisit Of the mesag that we gart to hyme mak; Yhowre self yhe have so specialy out tak, He thinkith ewill contempnit for to bee, Considering how that the necessitee Most prinspaly to yhowr supporting lyis.

For well it oucht o prince or o king Til honore and til cheriss in al thing O worthi man, that is in knychthed prewit; For throw the body of o man eschevit Mony o wondir, mony one aduenture, That merwell war til any creature.

And thus, madem, I wot, withouten were, If that ?hone knycht this day will persywere With his manhed for helping of the king, We sal have causs to dred in to no thing.

Than goith he one, withouten mor abaid, And our the reuar to the feld he raid; Don goith his spere onone In to the Rest, And in he goith, withouten mor arest, Thar as he saw most perell and most dred In al the feld, and most of help had ned, Whar semblyt was the first conquest king With mony o knycht that was in his leding. The first he met, doune goith boith horss &amp; man; The sper was holl, and to the next he Ra? That helpit hyme his hawbrek nor his scheld, Bot throuch and throuch haith persit in the feld. Sir kay, the wich haith this encontyr sen, His horss he strekith our the larg gren, And sir sygramors ek the desyrand, With sir gresown cummyth at yer honde, Son of the duk, and alsua sir ywan The bastart, and sir brandellis onan, And gaherss, wich that broyir was To gawan; thir sex in a Rass Deliuerly com prekand our the feldis With speris straucht, and couerit with thar scheldis; Sum for love, sum honor to purchess, And aftir them one hundereth knychtis was, In samyne will, thar manhed to assay. On his v falowis clepit than sir kay, And saith them, âsiris, thar has ?honder ben A courss that neuer more farar was sen Maid be o knycht, and we ar cummyn ilkon Only ws one worschip to dispone; And neuer we in al our dais mycht Have bet axampil than iffith ws ?one knycht Of well doing; and her I hecht for me Ner hyme al day, if that I may, to bee, And folow hyme at al mycht I sall, Bot deth or vthir adwentur me fall. With that thir sex, al in one assent, With fresch curag In to the feld Is went. The blak knychtis spere in pecis go?e, Frome of sqwyar o?e vthir haith he to?e, And to the feld onone he goith ful rycht; Thir sex with hyme ay holdith at yer mycht. And than bygan his wonderis in the feld; Thar was no helme, no hawbryk, nore no scheld, Nor yhit no knycht so hardy, ferss, nore stout, No ?hit no maner armour mycht hald owt His strenth, nore was of powar to withstond; So mych of armys dyde he with his honde, That euery wight ferleit of his deid, And al his fois stondith ful of dreid. So besely he can his tyme dispend, That of the speris wich sir gawin send, Holl of them all thar was not lewit o?e; Throw wich, but mercy, to the deyth is gon Ful many o knycht, and many o weriour, That couth susten ful hardely o stour. And of his horss supprisit ded ar two, One of his awn, of gawanis one also, And he one fut was fechtand one the gren, When that sir kay haith with his falowis se?; The sqwyar with his horss than to hym brocht; Magre his fois he to his courseir socht Deliuerly, as of o mychty hart, Without steropis in to his sadill start, That euery wycht beholding mervel has Of his strenth and deliuer besynes. Sir kay, seing his horss, and how that thai War cled in to sir gawanis aray, Askith at the squyar if he knewith What that he was, this knycht? &amp; he hym schewith He wist no thing quhat that he was, nore hee Befor that day hyme neuer saw with Ee. Than askith he, how and one quhat wyss On gawanis horss makith hyme sich seruice? The sqwar saith, âforsuth y wot no more; My lord ws bad, I not the causs quharfore.â The blak knycht, horsit, to the feld can sew Als fresch as he was in the morow new; The sex falowis folowit hyme ilkone, And al in front on to the feld ar go?; Rycht freschly one thar ennemys thai soght, And many o fair poynt of armys vroght. [T]han hapnyt to king malangins ost By ydras king discumfit was, &amp; lost, And fled, and to the conquest king ar go?e, Thar boith the batellis assemblit In to one; King malengynis in to his hart was wo, For of hyme self no better knycht mycht go; Thar xl thousand war thai for xv. Than mycht the feld rycht perellus be sen Of armyt knychtis gaping one the ground, Sum deith, and sum with mony a grewous wond; For arthuris knychtis, that manly war and gud, Suppos that vthir was o multitude, Resauit tham well at the speris end; Bot one such wyss thai may not lang defend. The blak knycht saw the danger of the feld, And al his doingis knowith quho beheld, And ek remembrith in to his entent Of the mesag that sche haith to hyme sent: Than curag, strenth encresing with manhed, Ful lyk o knycht one to the feld he raid, Thinking to do his ladice love to have, Or than his deth befor hir to resave. Thar he begynyth in his ferss curag Of armys, as o lyoune in his rag; Than merwell was his doing to behold; Thar was no knycht so strong, nor yhit so bold, That in the feld befor his suerd he met, Nor he so hard his strok apone hyme set, That ded or wondit to the erth he socht; For thar was not bot wonderis that he wrocht. And magre of his fois euerilkone, In to the feld oft tymys hyme alo? Throuch and throuch he passith to &amp; fro; For in the ward it was the maner tho That non o knycht shuld be the brydill tak Hyme to orest, nore cum behynd his bak, Nor mo than on at onys one o knycht Shuld strik, for that tyme worschip stud so rycht. ?hit was the feld rycht perellus and strong Til arthuris folk, set thai contenyt longe; Bot in sich wyss this blak knycht can conten, That thai, the wich that hath his manhed se?, Sich hardyment haith takyne In his ded, Them thocht thai had no maner causs of dred, Als long as he mycht owthir ryd or go, At euery ned he them recomfort so. Sir kay haith with his falowis al the day Folowit hyme al that he can or may, And wondir well thai have in armys prewit, And with thar manhed oft thar folk relewit; Bot well thai faucht in diuerss placis sere, With multitud yer folk confusit were, That long in sich wyss mycht thai nocht conte?. Sir kay, that hath sir gawans squyaris sen, He clepit hyme, and haith hyme prayt so, That to sir harwy the rewell wil he go, And say to hyme, âws think hyme ewil awysit; For her throuch hyme he sufferit be supprisit The best knycht that euer armys bur; And if it so befell of adwentur, In his defalt, that he be ded or lamyt, This warld sal have hyme vtraly defamyt. And her ar of the round table also A falouschip, that sall in well and wo Abid with hyme, and furth for to endur Of lyf or deth, this day, thar adwentur; And if so fal discumfyt at thai bee, The king may say that wonder ewill haith he Contenit hyme, and kepit his honore, Thus for to tyne of chevalry the flour!â The sqwar hard, and furth his way Raid, In termys schort he al his mesag said. Sir harwy saith, ây witness god, that I Neuer in my days comytit tratory, And if I now begyne In to myne eld In ewill tyme fyrst com I to this feld Bot, if god will, I sal me son discharg. Say to sir kay, I sal not ber the charg, He sal no mater have me to rapref, I sal amend this mys if that I lef.â The sqwyar went and tellit to sir kay; And sir harwy, in al the hast he may, Assemblyt hath his ostis, &amp; ono? In gret desyre on to the feld is gon Before his folk, and haldith furth his way; Don goith his sper, and ewyne before sir kay So hard o knycht he strykith in his ten That horss and he lay boith apone the gren. Sir gawan saw the counter that he maad, And leuch for al the sarnes that he had: That day sir harwy prewyt in the feld Of armys more than longith to his eld, For he was more than fyfty yher of ag, Set he was ferss and ?ong in his curag; And fro that he assemblyt his bataill Doune goith the folk of galotis al haill; For to withstond thai war of no poware, And yhit of folk x thousand mo thei vare. Kyng valydone, that sauch on such o wyss His falowis dangerit with thar ennemys, With al his folk, being fress and new, Goith to the feld onon, them to resskew; Thar was the feld rycht perellus a?a?e, Of arthuris folk ful many on var slan. Bot angus, quhich that lykith not to bid, And saw the perell one the tothir sid, His sted he strok, and with his ost is gon Whar was most ned, and thar the feld has ton. Kyng clamedyus makith non abaid, Bot with his ost one to the sid he raid. And ywons king, that haith his cummyn sen, Encounterit hyme in myddis of the gre?. The aucht batellis assemblyt one this wiss; On ather half the clamore and the cryiss Was lametable and petws for til her, Of knychtis wich in diuerss placis sere Wondit war, and fallyng to and fro, ?hit galyotis folk war xx thousand mo. The blak knycht than on to hyme-self he said: âRemembir the, how yhow haith ben araid, Ay sen ye hour that yow was makid knycht, With love, a?ane quhois powar &amp; whois mycht Yow haith no strenth, yow may It not endur, Nor ?hit non vthir erthly creatur; And bot two thingis ar the to amend, Thi ladice mercy, or thi lyvys end. And well yhow wot that on to hir presens, Til hir estat, nor til hir excellens, Thi febilness neuermore is able For to attan, sche is so honorable. And sen no way yow may so hie extend, My verray consell is, that yow pretend This day, (sen yow becummyne art hir knycht Of hir comand, and fechtit in hir sycht), And well yow schaw, sen yow may do no mor, That of resone sche sal the thank tharfore; Of euery poynt of cowardy yow scham, And in til armys purchess the sum nam.â With that of love in to o new desir His spere he straucht, and swift as any wyre With al his forss the nerest feld he soght; His ful strenth in armys thar he vroght, In to the feld rusching to and fro, Doune goith the man, doune goith the horss also; Sum throw the scheld is persit to the hart, Sum throw the hed, he may It not astart. His bludy suerd he dreuch, that carwit so Fro sum the hed, and sum the arm in two; Sum in the feld fellit is in swo?, Throw sum his suerd goith to the sadill doune. His fois waren abasit of his dedis, His mortell strok so gretly for to dred Is; Whar thei hyme saw, within a lytall space, For dreid of ded, thai levyng hyme the place, That many o strok ful oft he haith forlor?; The spedy horss away the knycht hath bor?. In to his wyrking neuermore he sest, Nor non abaid he makith, nor arest. His falowis, so in his knychthed assuryd, Thai ar recomfort, thar manhed is recoueryt, And one thar fois ful fersly thai soght, Thar goith the lyf of many o knycht to nocht. So was the batell wonderful to tell, Of knychtis to se the multitud that fell, That pety war til ony knycht to se? The knychtis lying gaping on the gren. The blak knycht ay continewit so fast, Whilk many one discumfit, at the last Are fled, and planly of the feld thei pas: And galyot haith wondyr, for he was Of mor powar, and askit at them qwhy As cowartis thai fled sa schamfully? Than saith o knycht, sor wondit in the brayne, âWho lykith, he may Retwrn a?ayne Frome qwhens we come, merwalis for to see, That in his tyme neuer sich sauch hee.â âMarwell,â quod he, âthat dar I boldly say They may be callit, and quhat thai ar, I pray?â âSchir, in the feld forsuth thar is o knycht, That only throw his body and his mycht Wencussith all, that thar may non susten His strokis, thai ar so fureows and ken. He farith as o lyone or o beyre, Wod in his rag, for sich is his affere. Nor he, the knycht in to the armys Red, Wich at the first assemble in this sted Wencussith all, and had the holl renown, He may to this be no comparysoune, Fore neuer he sesith sen the day vas go?, Bot euermore continewit in to one.â Quod galiot, âin nome of god! and we Al, be tyme, the suthfastness sal see.â [T]han he in armys that he had is gon, And to the feld with hyme a?ane hath ton Al the flearis, and foundyne sich aray His folk, that ner discumfyt al war thay; Bot quhen thai saw cummyne our the plan Thar lord, thai tuk sich hardement a?a?, That thar essen?eis lowd thai gon to cry. He chargit tham to go, that ware him by, Straucht to the feld, with all thar holl forss; And thai, the wich that sparit not the horss, All redy war to fillyng his command, And freschly went, withowten more demand: Throw qwich thar folk recoueryt haith thar place, For al the feld preswmyt that thar was O new oft, one such o wyss thai soght; Whar arthuris folk had passith al to nocht, Ne war that thai the better war ilko?e, And at thai can them vtraly dispo?e Rather to dee than flee, in thar entent, And of the blak knycht haith sich hardyment; For at al perell, al harmys, and myschef, In tyme of ned he can tham all ralef. [T]har was the batell dangerus &amp; strong, Gret was the pres, bath perellus &amp; throng; The blak knycht is born on to the ground, His horss hyme falyth, that fellith dethis wound. The vi falowis, that falowit hyme al day, Sich was the press, that to the erth go thay; And thar in myd among his ennemys He was about enclosit one sich wyss That quhare he was non of [his] falowis knew, Nor mycht nocht cum to help hyme, nore reskew. And thus among his ennemys allon His nakid suerd out of his hond haith ton; And thar he prewit his wertew &amp; his strenth; For thar was none within the suerdis lenth That came, bot he goith to confusioune. Thar was no helme, thar was no habirioune, That may resist his suerd, he smytith so; One euery syd he helpith to and fro, That al about the compas thai mycht ken, The ded horss lyith virslyng with the men. Thai hyme assal?eing both with scheld &amp; spere, And he a?ane; as at the stok the bere Snybbyth the hardy houndis that ar ken, So farith he; for neuer mycht be sen His suerd to rest, that in the gret rout He rowmyth all the compas hyme about. [A]nd galiot, beholding his manhed, Within his self wonderith of his ded, How that the body only of o knycht Haith sich o strenth, haith sich offere &amp; mycht; Than said he thus, âI wald not that throw me, Or for my causs, that such o knycht suld dee, To conquer all this world that is so larg.â His horss than can he with his spuris charg, A gret trunsioune In to his hond hath ton, And in the thikest of the press is go?, And al his folk chargit he to sess.

The lord he thonkit, and the horss hath ton, And als so fresch one to the feld is gon, As at no strokis he that day had ben. His falowis glad, one horss that hath hym sen, To galiot one vthir horss thai broght; And he goith one, and frome the feld he socht, And to the plan quhar that his ostis were; And brandymagus chargit he to stere Efter hyme, within a lytill space, And x thousand he takyne with hym hass.
