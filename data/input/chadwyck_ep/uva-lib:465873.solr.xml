      <field name="fulltext">TO The Right Reverend EDMUND KEENE, Lord Bishop of Chester.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THOUGHTS ON THE GLORIOUS EPIPHANY, &amp;c. Soft blew the tepid breeze, wafting fair Health The rosy nymph, from Hampton's beauteous bay: While on the sea-green surface, polish'd smooth As Parian marble, play'd the golden beams Of western Sol, gilding the gloomy groves That from the forests heights depend, and cloath With leafy majesty the shore: the hum Mean while of busy merchandize; the cry Of sailors, light of heart, and the mixt din Of soldiers martial drum, and shrill-ton'd fife Just dying, on the distant ear confus'd. All nature smil'd: heav'n, earth and sea conjoin'd Their beauties to exalt the glowing heart. Alas, how lost their beauties, and how dead To yonder hapless multitude, that rove In silent sort along the sea-beat shore: And send full oft their wishes and their sighs Big with distress, to that dear native land From whence, sad chance of war, torn by rude force They languish prisoners in a foreign clime! No more they view their lov'd Acadia's plains; No more their happy homes, and fertile fields; No more, their joyful families around, They taste the pleasures of domestic peace, Nor quaff full draughts from freedom flowing bowl. Their plains so lov'd, their fields with plenty crown'd, Rude soldiers waste: and they, immers'd in woe, Tread the lone beach: while on their languid sight The pleasing views around unheeded rise;— They rise on captives!—What's the gaudy room, The silken tapestry, or the cedar'd floor, To the lone linnet, sever'd from his mate And forests wild and free?—Who shall forbid The generous tear to swell the pitying eye? What tho' of hostile race, still they are men: And while we view them weeping o'er the graves Of friends departed, while we hear their prayers, Kneeling in sorrow sad those graves around: While we behold them slowly as they tread, With visage wan, and port disconsolate From burden'd breast heaving the deep-fetch'd groan, From languid eye bursting the trembling tear;— What Briton wears a heart, steel'd to the touch Of gentle Pity? Who can then refuse A sympathetic feeling of their woe! Oh, my Maria, may we ne'er refuse The just, the gen'rous tribute. There's a pain Sweetly delightful in soft Pity's touch, That gladdens, while it wounds the heart humane. May not their lot be ours?—For who can tell The dire event of war?—Should the great God, In just resentment of our nation's crimes, Blast our attempts, and frustrate all our hopes, And give us for a prey to Gallia's arms.— —Avert it gracious heav'n!—yet should such woe O'erwhelm our land, our brethren in distress, Acadia's sons, hold up the faithful glass, And give us a sad picture of ourselves, Prisoners in foreign climes!—How should the thought With humble gratitude inspire the soul, And tune the tongue to sing his boundless praise, Whose countless mercies, in rich clusters, hang Around our happy tents? Where every man Beneath his own vine sits, and eats secure Of his own fig-tree? Gratitude and praise Will best secure those mercies: God delights Chief in his servants thanks.—How should the thought Raise our fond hearts above this dark, dim spot, And shew us the deep poverty of earth And all its best enjoyments: where no rose Without a briar is found; where grows no sweet Without its poison: and whose dearest bliss Is bounded by the grave:—How should it teach To separate from our souls its fatal love, And lead to nobler hope, to nobler love, Hope, that deceives not; Love, that never fails! Come, then, Maria, and as join'd in heart, And that sweet nuptial union, whence hath flow'd Streams of increasing happiness to crown Our faithful passion: come, and let us join Our fondest efforts, nobly to upraise Our best affections, and employ them there, Where our best bliss demands: on that bright scene Of Love divine, “our glorious Lord's return,” To welcome all his children into joy. That longing for that day, our love may look Beyond the narrow boundaries of time To the dear hope of everlasting bliss. Oh thou can'st tell, what soft serenity That hope diffuses over all our joys: How all our sorrows lose their name and sting, Sooth'd by that hope, supported by that love! Without that love the blessings of fair peace, Become but splendid miseries: With that love Captivity itself, and all the ills Of desolating war, their horrors lose, While faithful patience hath its perfect work In the true pilgrim heart from earth abstract And drawn by love already into heaven.— But who, what mortal tongue can worthily Or paint that love divine; or thro' the breast Of men, diffuse its sweet persuasive power? Come, spirit divine, thou the strong bond of love Between the almighty Father and the Son, The source and fountain of eternal love; Thou only master of all human Hearts; Come, and with mighty energy impart Some touches of thy love, that my weak thoughts Aided by thee, illumin'd, and uprais'd, May to my subject's dignity respond: Arouse the expectations of mankind; Wake from deep sleep the inattentive throng: And strike the noblest, fullest chord to sound The melody of love, returning love, With crown of gold to deck each faithful brow! Then shall we see him:—every eye shall see And they which pierced him!—Then shall we hear, Then every ear shall hear th'arch-angel's trump, Proclaiming his approach; whose sound, more loud Than when ten thousand cannons with one roar Forth from their iron mouths, shake the vex'd deep Down to the bottomless abyss, and round Full many a league reiterate their hoarse And brazen thunder: louder far the trump Of that great angel shall be heard, whose sound, The adamantine pillars of the heavens Shall easy, as the wind the aspen's boughs, Move waving to and fro: to the center shake The trembling earth; the cearments of the grave Burst:—and call forth to life th'unnumber'd dead. As, when the bounteous Sun from Aries rolls, Quick'ning with genial light the pregnant world, All nature seems reviving: wide around A living verdure cloaths the blooming earth, And chears the languid eyes, that late fatigu'd Stretch'd o'er the plains, white with the glistering snow; The modest daisy and the cowslip wan Checquer the vivid green: and pale beneath The budding hawthorne the rathe primrose rears Her scenty flowrets, with blue violets join'd, That, fond of privacy, their odours rich Present, first offerings, to their sire, the sun; Of silent active virtue emblems meet. No more the hedges with their branches brown, And trees with naked tops, staring to heav'n, Deform creation: here the blossoms white The lenient air with richer odours fill, Than breathe from Coromandel's spicy coast: There the big gems burst beauteous into leaf, And give the trees their honour: every herb Uprears its dewy head: and teeming earth From fertile bowels casts her precious things, The fulness of her bounty, precious fruits.— —So shall she cast her dead: when that great morn Of resurrection comes; when that loud trump Of the arch-angel sounds: when shines the light, The light eternal, and with power divine Our bodies moulder'd into native dust Shall quicken into life: and give to rise, Wearing far other forms, our mortal clad With immortality, and our corrupt In incorruption lovely.—Thus their trusts Innumerous, sacred, shall the earth and sea At the dread summons, faithfully resign! An awful pause ensuing, every heart Throbbing with great expectance: the loud clang Of countless trumpets shall be heard, by the breath Of mighty angels blown, while they precede In solemn pomp the crimson'd sign, the Cross Triumphant, veil'd in ruddy light, and borne By myriads of bright seraphim.—From on high,— While the whole arch of heav'n empeopled thick Blazes with spirits of glory:—'midst th'acclaim Of all the heav'nly host, slow shall descend, Seated upon a throne, like fiery flame, Borne on a luminous cloud, the GOD, the JUDGE, The bad man's terror, and the good man's hope! His garment white as snow, and like pure wool His hair: bright as a flame of fire, his eyes: His feet, like burnish'd brass, as if they glow'd In the red furnace: forth from which shall come A fiery stream resplendent; while he rides Full royally, his car, by cherubim Upborn, whose wheels, self-mov'd, and full of eyes, As blazing beryl glow, and burning fire. Lo, dazzled with his lustre, darkness veils Creation's amplest brightness: lights full source The mid-day sun, instant before his face Becomes as sackcloth black: the silver moon As blood: forth from their orbs to earth down fall The darken'd stars: even as a fig-tree casts, Before a mighty wind, her unripe figs: The heavens themselves astonish'd, as a scroll Shrivel'd before the fire, shall pass away With noise insufferable: the elements With fervent heat dissolve: forth from their place Trembling shall fly each island, mountain, hill: And as the wax, before meridian Sol, Melt at his awful presence: while the earth, With all her works in general flame shall burn! Then, while his ample train shall fill the heaven, While thousand thousands to him minister, And while ten thousand times ten thousand stand Before his awful majesty, to bear His sov'reign mandates, or of life or death:— The judgment set, th'impartial volumes op'd, All secrets naked, every thought disclos'd, Caught up into the air, before his throne Shall stand all nations!— There, Maria, there Must thou and I, with all our kindred souls The righteous sentence, the just meed of all Our actions, the eternal doom receive, Eternal life, eternal death!—How great! Oh how this earth's best blessings sink in worth, When on that scene is open'd the mind's eyes! Where vengeance, vengeance dire, unutterable, On those shall fiercely fall, who know not God, Nor the blest Gospel of our sovereign Lord, With faithful love, obey: these from his face And from the living glory of his power, With everlasting ruin, endless woe Shall then be punish'd: then shall be consign'd To bottomless perdition: and condemn'd To dwell in hopeless horror, headlong hurl'd Down to the flaming pit, and bound in fire That never shall its hottest rage remit, Be quenched never!—Oh most horrible! Oh horrible to heart and ear!—And what Hath earth's poor lusts and vanities most vain To counterpoise this death eternal? What To counterpoise the loss of that high bliss Which now shall crown the Righteous: when their Lord Shall come to be admired in his saints, And glorified in each believing soul! Oh who can paint their raptures when the voice Of love divine shall, with mellifluous tone, Greet their glad ears, and silence every fear That swells the bosom 'midst that solemn scene! “Come, O ye blessed of my Father, come, “Come and receive the kingdom of bright bliss, “And joy immortal for yourselves prepar'd “Before the world's foundation: enter in “The everlasting mansions, and rejoice “With joy unspeakable.” At once the sound Innumerable of all the heavenly choir In concert sweet shall welcome the blest sons Of immortality: voices divine With instruments of tone celestial, tun'd In dulcet harmony: such as, to compare Great things with small—from the full choir resounds Of Handel's master-strains, to the high fame Of conquering Messiah dedicate: The rapt heart bounds with gladness.—Crowns inwove With amaranth and gold on every head Shall shine resplendent: robes of radiant white Fair beaming as the morning-star, shall glow On each illustrious body, glorified, And beauteous in the lustre of their God. Palms of unfading verdure in each hand At once shall speak their victory, and express Their triumph everlasting: golden harps For ever tun'd, shall glitter at their sides. On every brow celestial peace shall smile, And happiness unruffled; from each eye, Sparkling with joy immortal, shall be wip'd All tears for ever: for, the cause of tears, Foul sin and greedy death shall be no more! Celestial love shall every heart o'erflow, Celestial love shall every heart inspire, And to seraphic praise unceasing tune!— Heaven's golden vault with the melodious sound Triumphant echoing, 'midst the sweet acclaim Of all his host, Messiah conquering king, —His lov'd redemed at his right hand plac'd,— From judgment shall return; while myriads join Of angels, and archangels, princedoms, powers, And all the company of heav'n, to laud His righteous judgments: while Hosannahs sound Thro' all heaven's concave to the king of glory: Their heads the everlasting doors shall raise, The gates be lifted up, twelve gates of pearl, Each wide, as to admit a banner'd host, With all their colours flying, while the king Of glory, the dread Lord of hosts, the son Eternal shall come in, with all his train, And enter that blest city! See Revel. xxi. 22. whose vast space 'Twou'd weary Time to measure; whose high walls Glitter with living jasper; and whose streets Are of fine gold, pure as transparent glass: At whose twelve gates twelve mighty angels stand, Fair as the morn, and glorious as the sun: Forth from the throne of God, and of the Lamb, A river, clear as crystal, issues forth, The water of life: and gladdens with its streams The new Jerusalem: while its fair banks That tree of life, angelic food, produce, That erst in Eden grew, or ere frail man Tasted another fruit, which work'd his woe. Here God hath fix'd his seat, here ever dwells In glory as in blessedness supreme, His servants worship to receive, and glad With everlasting joy, that from him flows In richest fulness: here behoves no temple: God is the Temple: here no sun: for here The Light of God, and of the glorious Lamb For ever shines: one undiminish'd day Without created light, reigns beauteous: love Enlivens and illumines all with light, Life-giving and divine.—Such is the place Ordain'd, of boundless mercy, the abode Eternal of blest souls: here shall they live Imparadis'd in joy, in endless joy, Whose names are found recorded in the book Of life, whose foreheads with the lamb's red seal Are mark'd: and who with him approv'd, return From judgment all victorious! These alone— (For nought defiling, sin, nor sinners here, Shall ever enter,) these alone shall reign With God for ever; and the bliss enjoy Of his near presence, and the vision call'd By mortals, beatific; to express What saints in glory share; men by dim faith Scarce apprehend: hope leads to nearer views, And love will then consummate: when with saints Join'd in sweet union, we shall all accord In one high strain of praise: when we shall live, In amity divine, with all the friends Of our high Lord, whom sacred writ records, And long hath to our best affections won!— And there—oh pleasing recollection—there Our dearest friends, by death relentless torn From our embraces, joyful shall we meet, Immortal meet, to part no more!—The hope, Oh ye beloved Authors of my birth, Ye best of Parents, who, 'midst torments fierce And cruel anguish, in my arms expir'd; The mournful office, while my trembling hands Of closing your dear eyes perform'd—that hope, That balmy hope sooths my sad soul, and dries The silent tear, that frequent from my eye Drops mournful on remembrance of your love: That love, which o'er me from the cradle watch'd To manhood's dawn: sollicitous and fond: —Ah, who but parents ought can paint the pangs Heart-felt, that in the anxious parent's breast Throb for its darling offspring? Thence be taught Duteous regard, ye children, and return Grateful the tender love!—But earthly love How poor, how short! in those celestial realms Nor end, nor mixture shall be known. Alas, How unsupportable the load of woe, Without fair immortality's bright hope! How light all earthly sufferings, when the soul Disdains the grave, and carries its bold eye, Directed by strong faith into the realms Of light and love eternal?—There, oh there, Grant us, thou God benign, Lover of Souls, By the red blood, that from thy sacred wounds Flow'd liberal for man: oh grant us there To meet in bliss, and my transported soul Then fully, thrice blest Parents, shall express The debt of love I owe: which grateful thus I strive to speak in melancholy song Befitting lowly mortal: Earnest small Of future offerings, when on golden harps Together we shall chaunt immortal songs, Immortal made; and ravish'd with the joy, Fulness of joy, and pleasures evermore At the right hand of God!— Pardon, dread Lord, If ought too much presumptuous, or too high In hope,—thee I offend! Thy sacred word And promises divine forbid to Faith The glimmering of doubt. Yet when I view Myself unworthy and offending still Thy goodness infinite, methinks 'tis bold At all to hope.—But not on ME depends Acceptance final: Thou wilt not refuse The lowly soul that builds on Jesu's Love!— Smit by that hallow'd love, my muse, ere while To mortal passions dedicate, foreswore Th'adulterous service, and itself resign'd To thee its rightful Lord! Oh that my strains, How weak soe'er, might to thy praise redound, And join in universal nature's choir, To hymn thee general Lord!—Warm'd with that wish, Tho' faintly, thus I strive to lisp low thoughts, Low are the highest mortal tongues express, When everlasting love becomes their theme; And such is mine: thine everlasting love Bright shining on that great Epiphany, When, all thy mighty majesty display'd, We shall behold—behold Thee, as thou art; And, at the Vision gloriously transform'd, Be made—who can conceive the Greatness?—made Like THEE! Were it not strange, Maria, then to dread A day so fraught with blessings, so replete With good to man? to dread a change that brings Immortal glory?—Dreads the Mariner, Who, tost long time upon the ocean wild, Sails many a weary league from the dry coast Of Malabar or Bengala, waging long Unequal war with tempests, rocks, and waves, That well nigh have their way thro' the leak'd hull Of his shock'd vessel made—dreads he the port Friendly that brings him to his native soil, To the lov'd bosom of his faithful wife, And dear caresses of his infant race, Climbing with fondling joy his happy knees, And lisping their pleas'd stories: his big heart Swells with exstatic rapture: while a tear Of silent joy unbidden steals adown His sun-burnt cheeks.—Or didst thou dread that day, Say, my Maria, which return'd me, long Long absent, long expected to thy arms And bridal bed, thence sever'd by hard fate Just in the blossom of those nuptial joys, That since have into fulness spread, and cheer'd With undiminish'd sweetness?—Rather say, Did'st thou not number every lagging hour With fond impatience, and the minutes blame Too tedious in their course, till on thy sight, Fair solace of my soul, thy bridegroom rose Transported: bliss too big for utterance rode On our hearts pants triumphing!—Dread we then, Oh strange, the Bridegroom of our souls return, Whose love stronger than death, no mortal flame Can ought resemble? dread we then the port, That to the haven of eternal rest Our shipwreckt vessel brings?—Wherefore not long, Wherefore not look with expectation fond, And passion all-inflam'd, for that great day Of Jesu's coming: and the blissful hour That to our Bridegroom's everlasting arms, And nuptials all-consummate shall admit Our souls delighted?—King of terrors, Death, Thou art man's dread: How doth thy leaden dart, Oh mighty Conqueror, with cold horror pierce The heart benumb'd: make the chill blood stand still, And course no longer thro' the purple veins And allies of the body: while the pulse, Life's centinel, retiring from its watch, Gives notice of departing life: while steals O'er the dark eye-balls misty night; and stiff The limbs, so glowing late, freeze into clay Food for the darksom grave! Yet wherefore fear, What needs we must encounter? Wherefore fear A foe whom none can shun; whose stroke, tho' dread, Of force but momentary Cowards die many times, before their death: The valiant never taste of death but once: Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear: Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come, when it will come.— Julius Cæsar in Shakesp., sends the soul From the dark prison of an earthly cot To palace of celestial mould!—Who flies Adventure dangerous, and perils vast To gain renowned meed?—What lover fears The long dark cavern, that conducts his steps Lonely, beneath the bowels of the earth, To the fair bosom of his secret spouse, Wedded and won: yet not for some hard hap, Or parents frown, or fortune all-unmeet, Acknowledg'd and avow'd?—Old stories tell That erst Leander, warm'd with the generous love Of beauteous Hero, dreaded nought to dare Nightly the swelling waves; and with bold stroke Forc'd thro' rough ocean his fond way, while led By friendly light from her fair hand, whose touch Repay'd the glad adventurer. Of love Such the commanding power! He was lost in a dark tempestuous night. ?????? ??? ?????? ????????, says Chrysostom.—So did we love The Bridegroom of our souls, who forth from heav'n Hath hung his words sure light, safe to conduct Our path unerring: gloomy death's deep waves Nought should we dread, nor fear the monster's dart More than the faithful youth the kindly wave That bore him to his love?—But ah, that wave Who without love could dare? Death's sting most sharp Is Sin: and sin, rebellious sin, is want Of love alone: where Jesus holds the sway Victorious in the heart, all other loves Hide their diminish'd heads: and the rank train Of bestial, devilish passions 'fore him fly, As, 'fore his great exemplar, morning light, Foul darkness, with her murderers bath'd in blood, Muffled adulterers, thieves that love the shade, Spirits of night, that walk the earth; and beasts That to their dark caves haste, growling at day, And hide them from the Sun.—Oh the cold love Of our degenerate hearts, in these last days; How senseless of thy beauty, of thy love, Thy matchless beauty, love unspeakable, Thou altogether lovely!—Hence how dread To our imaginations pale with fear, The thoughts of death! Men shiver at the name! His terror makes cold cowards of us all: Nor they, whose trade is death, are from the fear, —Oh shame—exempt! And whence this fear?—Ah, look How every love, how every lust can lead Men's hearts its willing captive; how they doat On shadows vain, and triflingly pursue Bubbles, that burst and lose their colour'd rings, Or ere the delicate breath breathes on them!—Look, How every love, but love divine leads on Its potent multitudes, that flutter round The shadow vain of unsubstantial joys: As gaudy butterflies, that lightly spread Their painted down, and skim from flower to flower Of momentary stay: or as the moth That foolish plays around the dazzling flame, Till in the fatal circle caught, it drops, And woe and wisdom learns at once,—too late! Look, how compliant with the world's fell lore, To fashion slaves, and in strong custom's chain Bound; with the multitude what numbers rush Precipitate to pay their civil court At vice, or folly's temple: tho' recoils Their better reason, and their soberer sense The rank idolatry disclaims.—Ah look At these, innumerable; and doubt no more, Whence comes death's dread, and judgment's trembling fear. On men's brows wonder sits, to hear the fond The tale enthusiastic, that there were— Oh that their numbers yet were found!) there were Who welcom'd death more warmly than the bride Her faithful bridegroom: and the lov'd approach Of their Immanuel in the clouds desir'd With expectations more awake, than thine, Oh soul of avarice, Carpus, hov'ring o'er The rent-roll wish'd of some estate immense, By thy insatiate usury well nigh Devour'd from spend-thrift heir!—Look, christians, look, —If Christians rightly call'd, who never fight, Tho' with the red cross mark'd upon your brows, Beneath the crimson'd banner of your God, Against foul sin, proud Satan, and the world, Deceitful and deceiv'd:—befits not then The name, Deserters, rather?—Yet to call, If haply the remembrance may inspire With penitent shame well-pleasing, back to call To the victorious sign of grace and peace, Look at the noble champions who have wag'd Full well the glorious war!—See in the Van, Amidst the chosen leaders, toilsome Paul, Loaden with victories, in triumphant sort Wishing to be dissolv'd, and be with Christ! While, in faith's full assurance, he declares, “The time of my departure is at hand, “And ready am I now to be pour'd forth “As a libation sweet, unto my God! “And pleasing the reflection! I have fought “And constantly maintain'd the noble fight: “I've run the course complete: have kept the faith: “Henceforth of righteousness the golden crown “Is laid up for me: the immortal crown, “Which at that day, the Lord, the righteous judge “Will give to ME!—Yet not to Me alone, “But to all those, that his appearing Love.” And such are they, that glorious file led on By Stephen, proto-martyr, whose blest hands Unfurl from standard high, the flaming flag, Beneath whose banner these have nobly fought And dy'd their robes in blood! Oh how they long'd, With ardent joy,—how constantly they scorn'd Nay sought, nay welcom'd, flames, wild-beasts, and racks, With all the cruel wantonness of death Devis'd by tyrants persecuting rage: And wearied out with patience all-divine Invention's subtlest tortures: faithful found, Found faithful unto death!—Hail, glorious throng, Of Martyrs noble army! ever hail! High testimony have ye borne to Jesu's truth, And Jesu's love consummate. Be your crowns Bright with superior lustre!—Well ye deem'd Those happy, who obtain'd on earth such grace, Favour'd so highly, as to shed their blood, In the Redeemer's cause! well could my soul, (If envy ought permitted to allow—) Envy your choice felicity: and sure If envy e'er were lawful, it were here. Yet 'midst the radiant troop, it glads my heart, A squadron to behold of port divine From my lov'd country. Faithful Ridley, hail, Truths strenuous champion: with that soldier bold Of men regardless, Latimer, to flames Jocund, as to a bridal bed, who hied: Hail, all-laborious Cranmer, soul of love— Well did thy dauntless courage expiate Thy right hand's fault: while unappall'd thou stood'st, And gav'st th'offender to consuming fire! Thou never knew'st resentment to thy foe, Yet spared not, with indignation just, Thy tenderest flesh! Archbishop Cranmer was of the most remarkably sweet and forgiving temper, insomuch that it used to be said, “The best way to gain the Archbishop's favour was to do him a shrewd turn:” so much did he delight to forgive. When brought to the stake, he thrust his right hand into the flame, and stood undaunted while it was consum'd.—See the history of these Martyrs in Fox and others. First of Reformers, hail, And chief of British Martyrs! Well my song Could be content, thy praises to record With all the countless multitude, that throngs From Britain's shore! whose names live here embalm'd In faithful memory, in the book of life Recorded live for ever!—Yet the meed Of my poor verse, blest worthies, but ill suits Your praises high:—Oh might our towering hopes Rise into emulation, while we view The lustre of your deeds:—Rise from our death And sleep supine, struck with the mighty love Of that eternal captain, who led on Your souls, thro' opposition perilous, To victory immortal! Yet to truth, At once, and friendship, let my song be just; Nor thou, my friend, above the reach of praise, Crown'd in the realms of bliss, can ought suspect, Of flattery my song.—Yes, Jesus, yes, In these degenerate days, thy glowing love Found in L???'s heart a welcome seat; There burnt with all its purity divine, And fill'd her bosom with the courage bold Of Confessors undaunted, and the zeal Of suffering Martyrs: ah, too early snatch'd, Fair flower from this our globe: humbly we own The chastisement divine! yet tho' compell'd To weep our own sad loss, thy mighty gain Bids us rejoice for thee! Thy course is run, And now the end of all thy wishes gain'd, With him: thou ever liv'st, for whose dear sake, To live and die on earth was all thy care! —Our warfare yet remains: and still we fight, Tho' faintly, our grand foes: oh may the hope Of meeting henceforth in the realms of joy, Our courage animate, and lead us on All-manfully, beneath the banner wide Of Jesus, conqueror, to maintain the fight, Against the subtle legions of the prince Of darkness horrible: against the force Of an opposing world; and the foul wiles Of the deceitful flesh.—Fruitless those wiles, Those Legions impotent to storm the soul Secure in Christ! Look, how its towering head Aloft to heav'n the stately cedar rears, On the high mountains brow: nor deigns to stoop Amidst the loudest clamours of the winds Eurus and Auster, and the boisterous north, Roaring with indignation vain around Its princely trunk!—So midst temptations rage Resolv'd, unmov'd, the steadfast Christian stands Rooted in Jesu's Love! But that firm Love, The love of his appearing, with the crown, Of righteousness eternal, and the hope Of living ever with our fellow Saints, In amity unshaken, can alone Inspire that resolution, and the faith Which to the end undaunted perseveres; As cloud-capt Teneriff, fixt, and unremov'd! And who but loves that coming, who but longs With anxious hope, that in his bosom bears, A heart ought glowing with his Saviour's love? And what heart glows not with that Saviour's love, Who views him on dread Calvary expos'd In naked anguish for the sins of men! Who longs not to behold this man of grief Assuming all his glory: to behold The mock'd redeemer: his immortal brows Crown'd with far other diadem, than erst On Earth he wore; who longs not to behold His Saviour o'er his foes, o'er Death and Hell Triumphant ride, and judge the subject world! Ah, Pilate, then far other will he seem To thee all-trembling, than the man of woe Presented to the Jews, with blood defil'd, And plough'd his back with scourges! Other, far, Oh Caiaphas, than that blasphemer deem'd, Thou did'st to death adjudge! His lucent robe And golden sceptre will evince him now, Oh Herod, to thy shame far other king Than thou supposedst, when in impious sort Amidst thy revel-rout of soldiers rude Thou cloathedst him, in Jewry, with a robe Of splendid mockery!—Other will he seem, Far other, oh ye unbelieving tribe, Than that revil'd impostor, whom ye treat, Proud reptiles, with the insolence of scorn, And his pure laws defy: his judgment dread And indignation just well may ye wish, How fruitless,—at that moment,—to defy! Then, combatants so doughty,—who, in house Of flesh, here while on heavenly loan you live, Dare in rebellion base wage impious war Against your Father, Saviour, and your God.— Then will ye feel your wretched impotence: Too late: ah, that ye now were wise, now felt That impotence, all lowly!—Other far, Ye faithful found, try'd servants of your Lord— Will all his beaming beauties, and his love, Transcendently divine glow on your eyes, And fill your ravish'd hearts, far other, than Your souls warm wishes fancy, or your thoughts By brightest faith illumin'd, dare conceive! —The wonders who can reach? Who but desires With ardent love those wonders to behold, And see the royal Solomon enthron'd In everlasting glory?—But to share Copartners in that glory!—Deem we not The season long, till the glad hour arrives Of blissful consummation? Deem we not The season long, till with enraptur'd sight, Our Nature high exalted, 'bove all praise, In lustre and perfection, we behold Dazzling and eminent: from the stains of sin, From weakness and corruption, and from Death, Eternally set free; this mortal cloath'd With immortality: these bodies vile, Sprung from the grave, in heavenly beauty deck'd And like the glorious body of their Lord Fashion'd by his divine transforming power: So from the homely seed to faithful soil Entrusted, fresh and fair a vernant plant Springs beauteous, quickened from its dying state By rains prolific, and the genial force Of vivifying light: bearing aloft Its flowery head, in fragrant sweetness rich, Far other than its seed, and yet the same! —Then shall our souls be perfected in love; All doubtings cease, all languor be away, And our hearts flame, with undiminish'd heat, Burn even on, thro' endless ages burn, Supported by the everlasting light Of God's near presence!—Then shall we receive The crown immortal: enter then the realms Of love eternal: then for ever live In happiness unfading: with the joys That flow from God's right hand in plenteous streams, Still satiate and still thirsting: 'midst the choirs Of Saints and Angels, ceaselesly employ'd To hymn eternal love: in converse sweet, With spirits divine on all Jehovah's works And wonders, passing wonder, on our view In all their greatness rising, still employ'd And finding still fresh subjects to employ! —Oh state of joy consummate where one day Of perfect peace shall reign—How longs my soul To enter on thy gladness! How my heart Longs, Jesu, for thy coming! to set free Th'imprison'd pilgrim from frail flesh and sin, From evil and from death, to wing her way, Her joyful way, to liberty and Thee! As by the pirate hand of Paynim fierce, Scouring the seas for prey, a captive caught, And in deep dungeon, dark, and dank confin'd, On scanty offals fed, from the fair light Of chearful day cut off; with the sore weight Of irksome iron wearied: while each hour Is lengthen'd with the apprehensions dire Of tortures manifold: as longs the soul Of captive so forlorn, on the safe shore Of his lov'd Britain once to stand, and taste The sweets of golden freedom, who hath built Her towering airy on the top-most bough, In his high-favour'd island!—So to stand On his celestial free, fair country's shore, Earnest should each imprison'd soul desire; Thus from foul sin and Satan's durance, long For liberty consummate: ardent thus For the divine deliverer's coming wait, And pant for his wish'd rescue!—But can they Their chains who love, that rescue prize, or wish?— Sin's captives, her too willing slaves, not wish, But hapless dread that coming! and enslav'd To sin, who gives to death his pointed dart And arms with all his terror,—ah, how dire Th'approach of that stern tyrant!—Jesu's love The poison'd dart extracting, and the wounds Heal'd by the sovereign balsam of his blood All precious: fresh and fair the soul revives, And, as the wither'd plant by waters fed, Blooms into Life.—Oh, sinner, would'st thou shun Of death at once, the wages and the woe, Death everlasting, everlasting pain, Fly to this saving love: haste for thy life To this sole city of refuge, from the hand Of blood's avenger. On the altar's horns Lay hold, poor criminal, and plead for life, Plead with pathetic force, and violence Well-pleasing to thy God: plead as undone, As lost, condemn'd, eternally condemn'd, Cry, cry aloud for mercy,—mercy, Lord, And life for a lost soul! Prayer's arrow drawn Down to the head by nervous penitence On meek humility's compliant string, Wings to the destin'd mark its certain way, And ne'er was shot in vain! Thrice happy he, Of whom it can be said, “Behold he prayeth.” Acts ix. 11. Prayer is the soul's desire pour'd forth to God, And cannot but obtain the Grace desir'd, Which only to desire is to have. But who would pray aright must cease from sin: The rebel who for pardon craves, yet not Lays down the arms rebellious, makes vain suit To majesty offended. Who would wish His Saviour's face propitious to behold, Must his commandment blameless to the end, And without spot still labour to preserve, Maintaining faith's good fight.—And need there is, Hereto of powerful Grace, won to the soul By fasting and by alms: but chief obtain'd In that dear feast commemorative of Love Unparallel'd: where meek-ey'd faith beholds The bleeding God: and hungry feeds on food Divine, the bread of life: strength of the soul, And seed of endless life!—Hail, sign and seal High-valued, of salvation! feed me, Lord, There feed me, prostrate at thy altar laid, And with the banquet rich, refresh my soul, Sweet antepaste of heav'n! May my right hand Sooner forget her cunning, than—her seat While memory holds in this distracted globe— That I forget in that dear feast of Love, Thee to remember, to remember thee, Of sinners dying friend! With melting heart Let me contemplate in the mystic pledge Thy body broken, and thy flowing blood; Blood,—that so freely flow'd from every wound For man ingrate: and to my soul receive The heavenly food! mean while in wonder lost, In wonder at my self, so base, so vile, And yet so lov'd, so honour'd: for the price Of man's redemption was Immanuel's blood! Nor let me daily cease to meditate On the high things recorded in thy WORD: To cherish thus my hopes, confirm my faith, And from thy precious promises inflame Still more and more my soul's warm love to Thee! Who thro' the world's thick darkness would direct His course aright: still must in hand hold forth The Word's pure light: who would the sevenfold power Of Satan's malice vanquish, must in hand Continual bear this sword two-edg'd, whose stroke No power infernal, tho' with triple steel And adamant encompass'd, can withstand: Its sharpness severs well each fleshly lust, And at one stroke the carcase of foul sin Lays open; while from forth its glittering blade Such beaming lustre darts upon the soul, As naked all to view each latent thought, And each intent discovers.—Well should learn The christian soldier, in dire war engag'd With hellish and with earthly foes, combin'd To work his woe eternal,—well to wield This weapon all-invincible: while arm'd At every point, with armour proof, of God The workmanship complete: with faith's strong shield, Truth's golden girdle, and salvation's helm: With righteousness's breast-plate: and his feet Shod and prepar'd with evangelic peace! Oh may my hand be taught, still more and more The happy art to ply this spiritual sword, The word of God, successful! 'Tis from hence New consolation flows, and vigour fresh, The battle to renew 'gainst foes, tho' strong, Yet yielding daily to the strength of God. Blest word, on thee are grounded all our hopes; Thou, letter choice of love from our dear lord, Assurest of his coming, and the joys Reserv'd in blest futurity, for those Who love that coming! As to her heart the bride The lov'd epistle of her absent spouse With fervent rapture clasps: so to my heart Thee ever, till the day the bridegroom comes, Close let me clasp: nor ever cease to read, Thy amorous contents: that my heart's flame May glow with still increasing light and warmth!— Nor friendly converse would I fail to hold With those whose happy labours have been spent In winning to this WORD the hearts of men: While in their sacred pages branching forth Its promises celestial, and its threats With evangelic hope to fire the soul.

I would be understood principally to refer to this author's excellent Meditations. Oh may I to my lowly strains derive Some merit from the friendship of thy name; Strains, whose exalted subject fills thy heart, So constant with delight; and from thy tongue In converse pours such streams of eloquence That the rapt hearer wonders at his fears Of death ere while, and glowing with the love Of Jesu, caught from thee, longs to behold His Saviour in the clouds: for who can stand Amidst the sweetness of Arabian groves, And not bear thence some fragrance?—Valued friend, Proceed; and thy too feeble strength renew'd, May to hoar age thy journey be prolong'd, And strew'd each step with blessings to mankind!

May thy crown Be bright with eminent lustre, in the realms Of retribution faithful: while on earth Considerate we strive from thy blest toils To make improvement holy; and advance From strength to strength: till we together come; And stand in Sion 'fore the God of Gods! Ah, when shall we so stand, or how so stand? How, my Maria?—Glory be to God, Who giveth us the victory thro' Christ, Triumphant Mediator!—Let us then The eucharistic hymn join to his fame, And close with grateful praise the feeble verse, All too unworthy his rich love: unmeet For argument so high: yet not disdains The father fond his lisping infant's tales Affectionate and artless:—“Thou, dear Lord, Thou art our Father, and thy children, We: And as a Father with compassion mild His children views, so thy paternal eye With gracious pity on us looks: thy care All-provident defends; shields and protects, From ills surrounding: crowns with life, with health, With blessings, countless, bountiful: the pledge Of those unnumber'd in our Father's house Reserv'd to crown his sons, when they return From pilgrimage and trial well-approv'd! And oh what bounties rich, what glories high Unutterable, are reserv'd in that blest house The palace of his sons, when here below Even in our prison dark, our earthly cot, Such goods profuse hang rich on every side! Oh thou, who feed'st the ravens when they call, And in their snowy beauty so dost deck The lilies of the field: give me to trust With full dependence, Father, on thy will; And thy appointments high, grateful receive, (Without base murmuring) of good or ill: For best thou know'st our weal— And love like thine, Celestial Bridegroom o'er that weal to watch Can never cease; safe may our soul's repose Love's banner o'er us spread: while thy left-hand Is plac'd beneath us, and thy tender right Folds us in thy affectionate embrace! See Cant. c. ii. 6. Oh teach us to return like love to thine! Oh cause our hearts to glow with passion fond! While in thy bleeding beauties, heavenly spouse, We view thy mighty love; and each red drop Is as a precious pledge, thou fairest found Amidst ten thousands! All our doubts dispel, And fill with holy confidence our souls, Such confidence of love as well besuits A Bridegroom eminent in love, like thee! And who shall tax our highest confidence? Friendship without it is a name: and thou, Thou art our sovereign, thou our chiefest friend: Oh matchless grace; thou, Saviour, hast not scorn'd Benign to call us friends: and to thyself By all the ties of friendship and of blood, (Stoop down, ye angels, wonder and adore!) Poor mortals bind, thy brethren!—And, my God, May I presume—oh unexampled love— To call thee Brother?—Not to call thee so, Were impious, were profane: thou, to that end, From glory to the Virgin's womb came down, Cried in the stable, suffer'd on the cross, And bore man's nature, to ally lost man, In marvellous relation to his God! Our Father then—oh how august is man, Seen in his true relation!—And our spouse, Our Brother, and our Friend—exult, my soul— Is HE, who in the hollow of his hand Measures the waters: with his span metes out The vast circumference of heaven: who weighs In scales the massy mountains, and the hills In even balance poises: who the winds Holds in his fists: says to the sea, Be still, And to the wild storms, Peace. Lo, he takes up The islands, as a very little thing! All nations are before him as a drop Of water from the bucket: as the dust, As the small dust, that on the balance beam Hangs imperceptible: as nothing, less Than nothing—vanity!—What then am I? I tremble at myself, in his dread sight! —Yet in that sight how dear a soul redeem'd! How great, how precious! What a dower immense, An habitation how divine awaits The bride, the child, of such a spouse, and sire? I kindle into confidence: the thought With ardent longing my wrapt heart inspires! Oh father, honour'd ever;—ever-lov'd And beauteous bridegroom; brother, friend, and Lord, Redeemer, hope, sun, shield, my God, my All! Oh that in all thy mighty power array'd, That clad in all thy majesty and love— Oh that the solid firmament of heaven Thou would'st in sunder rend! That thou would'st come, Come down in sovereign pomp: that at thy feet The everlasting mountains might flow down, And earth dissolve like wax before thy face! While thro' the eternal deep, illumin'd wide With sevenfold glory, thy high praise resounds! Then we to thine unending love receiv'd, From sin, from sorrow, from decay set free, Shall enter new Jerusalem, with thee, City of joy, and realm of endless peace! Hail sovereign love! thy coming we expect, And long, with souls awake, to hear the Trump, To see the sign, to meet thee in the clouds! Hail sovereign love! Thee first and last we sing, Grateful our harps attuning to thy praise, Who with the Father and the Spirit blest, One seat of sovereign glory fill: supreme Alike in power, in majesty the same, Co-equal, coeternal: awful three, In essence undivided, as in love! Oh could we reach the strain, that pleasing erst Rang thro' Heav'n's concave, when thy work complete, The morning stars in sweetest concord sang, And all the sons of God shouted for joy! Then might we hope to win thy favouring ear Attentive to our Lauds:—But all we hope, Omnipotent, from efforts feeble, low, Like ours, is pardon and indulgence bland! Oh with a gracious eye our fond desires, That fain would tower aloft, deign to behold! Thine, Jesus, thine we are: and much we joy In the relationship divine: to thee Gladly our helm we leave, steer thou our course, Unsleeping Pilot, over this world's wave! Thou our frail vessel in the deep hast launch'd; Thou, in much mercy, every rock hast shewn, Each quick-sand kindly pointed out, and taught How to avoid the perils of each storm, To hush each tempest, and to calm each wave! —Oh let the love, that thus unsought was kind, Implor'd, its kindness still preserve: and guide Unskilful as we are our vessels helm: Safe landing us from tempests and from waves In that lov'd harbour, on that long'd for shore, Where peace eternal blooms, and one glad day Of undiminish'd joy for ever shines Where, in bright crouds, upon the crystal beach, Saints, angels, friends, stand ready to receive, And welcome us from out the crazy bark Nigh-founder'd, landing!—They, each peril past, Death's gloomy terrors vanquish'd, and each foe Subdued, with gratulations sweet, and songs Of joy, shall greet our souls: and 'midst the shouts Of victory celestial, and the tone Of heavenly harps, by heavenly harpers strung, Shall to thy glorious presence introduce:— But words are wanting here:—We prostrate fall, Before thee trembling, ravish'd, loving, lost!— Come then, Lord Jesus: all our souls are thine! Oh come, sweet Saviour, quickly, quickly come! We languish, love of God, for thy delay! Why tarry thus thy chariot-wheels?—How long? When will it be?—Come quickly:—Lord, how long! ??? ?? ??????, ??? ? ?????, ????????, ????. ??? ? ?????? ??????, ????. ??? ? ?????, ??????, ??? ? ????? ????????? ?? ???? ???? ??????? ????? ? ???????? ????? ??? ??????? ????. ????[] ??? ?????, ????? ?????.
